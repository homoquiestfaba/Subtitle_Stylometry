1
00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:04,067
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:17,300
(moves into suspenseful
orchestral music)

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,033
- My name is Josh Kirby.

4
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:26,367
I was just your
 average 9th grader,

5
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:29,900
my biggest problem was
 getting good grades.

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,300
And my idea of excitement
 was racing my bicycle.

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,200
(school bell ringing)

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,433
Yes!

9
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:39,067
I never thought time
would catch up with me.

10
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:41,200
But I couldn't have imagined,
 (train horn blaring)

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,867
that hundreds of years from now,

12
00:00:42,867 --> 00:00:46,200
mankind would invent
 The Nullifier,

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,633
a device capable of controlling,

14
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:50,800
or destroying the Universe.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,733
- [Alien] Prepare for the storm.

16
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:55,633
- [Josh] A scientist
 named Irwin 1138,

17
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:58,567
tried to disassemble
and hide The Nullifier,

18
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:01,133
but even he couldn't stop--
 - [Irwin] Dr. Zoetrope!

19
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:03,100
(laser guns firing)

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,367
(triumphant orchestral music)

21
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:06,600
- [Dr. Zoetrope] Give
 me The Nullifier!

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,467
- [Irwin] You are
 too late, Zoetrope!

23
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:11,567
- [Dr. Zoetrope] It's
 never too late for me!

24
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:13,600
- Irwin and Zoetrope have
 been chasing each other

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,500
across the Time Stream,

26
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,567
trying to be the first to
 find The Nullifier's pieces.

27
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:21,900
This time, they're
 gonna land in 1995.

28
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,067
The place, my front yard!

29
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:28,967
Now, I'm going along for
the ride of all time!

30
00:01:30,967 --> 00:01:33,400
What's goin' on,
 well where are we?

31
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,967
- [Irwin] I hope you're prepared
to do battle, young man.

32
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:37,867
This will be a war through time,

33
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:41,300
and Dr. Zoetrope will
 take no prisoners!

34
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,133
(frenetic orchestral music)

35
00:01:45,133 --> 00:01:48,167
- [Josh] We've got
 help from a Warrior!

36
00:01:48,167 --> 00:01:50,400
- My name is Azabeth Siege.

37
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,500
- Oh, she's amazing!

38
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,533
And a magical creature called
 Prism to show us the way.

39
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,633
Together we're on a
 quest through time,

40
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:01,133
visiting different worlds

41
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:04,367
to fight for The
 Nullifier's pieces.

42
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:06,933
- [Dr. Zoetrope] I'm
 obviously in the right place,

43
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:08,433
and the right time.

44
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:11,400
- Because if Zoetrope ever
 assembles The Nullifier,

45
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,233
he'll conquer time itself.

46
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:16,533
I've gotta try and
 save the Universe.

47
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:20,367
(triumphant orchestral music)

48
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:03,233
I was just a 14 year-old kid
 before my adventure began,

49
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:06,300
but now I'm Josh
 Kirby, Time Warrior.

50
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:11,300
(triumphant orchestral music)

51
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,467
(moves into mellow
 orchestral music)

52
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,400
- [Narrator] On the last chapter

53
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,800
of Josh Kirby... Time Warrior!

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,633
- Oh, oh!

55
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:34,700
Whoa!

56
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:39,167
(leaves crunching)

57
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:40,867
- I have tried every trick

58
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:44,200
in the time travel
 book to locate Josh.

59
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,100
There is the off chance

60
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,933
that Zoetrope's slightly
superior intellect

61
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:52,733
may enhance his ability to
 pinpoint Josh's location.

62
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,967
- Josh and I are going
 into Nightmare Forest.

63
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:57,300
- Nightmare Forest?

64
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,367
- [Dr. Zoetrope] It's
 true, he is a Time Warrior.

65
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:04,600
- Well, I say we take
 care of that big bully

66
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,267
once and for all!

67
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:08,133
(suspenseful orchestral music)

68
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:09,833
- I'd love to stay
everyone, but there are

69
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,467
three more of these deadly
 components gone down.

70
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:15,633
Hey, Dr. Zoetrope's after us!

71
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:16,567
(spaceship banging)

72
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:19,200
- Commencing efficiency action!

73
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,233
(bombs exploding)

74
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,767
- Turn the pod around!
 - What?

75
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:23,367
We're not turning!

76
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:24,800
(train horn blaring)

77
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,933
- What are you waiting for?

78
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:27,367
Go ahead and use one of your

79
00:05:27,367 --> 00:05:31,233
one-in-a-billion Time
 Warrior powers and save us!

80
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,633
(ethereal orchestral music)

81
00:05:36,633 --> 00:05:39,233
(moves into suspenseful
orchestral music)

82
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:41,533
- By the Codes of Kang,
Irwin do something!

83
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,600
- Do something!

84
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,267
Pull off, pull off!

85
00:05:45,267 --> 00:05:47,500
- I'm trying, I'm trying!

86
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,633
(suspenseful orchestral music)

87
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:52,900
- Zoetrope's right behind us!

88
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,633
Look, where I come from,
if a machine goes nuts,

89
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:59,167
there's only one sure-fire
 method of repair! (strains)

90
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,900
(straining)

91
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,733
Whoa!

92
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,633
Whoa!

93
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,633
(suspenseful orchestral music)

94
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:11,400
(screaming)

95
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,867
(train horn blaring)

96
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:17,200
(screaming)

97
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,167
We did it!

98
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,867
- We did it?

99
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:28,300
We did it?
 - We did it.

100
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,400
- [Irwin] We did it,
 we did it, we did it!

101
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,667
- We did it!

102
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:33,200
We did it!

103
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,833
We-- (groans)

104
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,067
- Do not let your emotions

105
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,967
get the better of
 you, Josh Kirby!

106
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:39,933
- We were almost
 blown to smithereens!

107
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,367
- And I am certain we
 will almost be again,

108
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:43,533
but I hardly think

109
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,467
that's appropriate
behavior for a Warrior!

110
00:06:45,467 --> 00:06:46,633
- Warrior?

111
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:47,467
What Warrior?

112
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:48,900
I'm a 9th grader!

113
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,733
Woo-hoo!

114
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:52,067
- Yeah, we did it!

115
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:52,833
We did it!

116
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,500
I did it!

117
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,667
Oh, I am now the first
 smartest man in the Galaxy,

118
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,500
in the Universe, in
 the 25th Century,

119
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,567
in the whole of the Time Stream!

120
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,367
As it should be!

121
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:10,133
(laughs) Oh, who knew that
victory could taste this sweet!

122
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:12,933
Oh, fare thee well you no good--

123
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:13,767
- Irwin!

124
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,100
- Yes, yes Josh?

125
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:22,067
- Look, the guy's dead, should
 we really be celebrating?

126
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,100
Look, I know he was a
 crumb and all but...

127
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,700
- Josh, my boy!

128
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:30,067
That no goodnik
 Zoetrope threatened to
 destroy all of time,

129
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:32,133
just for his own selfish end!

130
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:34,700
He showed no
compassion, or remorse,

131
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,400
as he went through and
destroyed Galaxy, after Galaxy.

132
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,833
Why should I?

133
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,900
- While I agree with
 you, we must also respect

134
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,533
the souls of soldiers
 who died in battle

135
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:47,300
fighting for their cause, good
 or bad, as the case may be!

136
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,400
- But you two are acting as
 if he was on some kind of

137
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,300
noble quest, and
not on a mission

138
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,767
to decimate the Time Stream!

139
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:58,933
His demise, untimely as it
 may seem, is cosmic Karma!

140
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,333
(Prism purring and chattering)

141
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,333
Surely there's a Code of
Kang in here somewhere!

142
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:07,633
Come on everybody,

143
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:12,333
let's pat ourselves on
the back, we saved time!

144
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,533
- That is true!

145
00:08:13,533 --> 00:08:15,800
But there is still
 much damage to correct

146
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,300
throughout the Time Stream,
 and time is wasting!

147
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,900
- Excuse me, can we at
least catch our breath?

148
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,967
Come on Beth!

149
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:24,367
- Azabeth, Josh Kirby.

150
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:27,333
Azabeth, I do not
 call you Osh Kirby!

151
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,633
- Yeah, thank Kang
 for small favors.

152
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:31,833
Is it really that hard to relax?

153
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,900
- I will relax when the Time
 Stream is back in order,

154
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,967
when my debt to you is repaid,

155
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:38,633
and when I am back
 with my own people.

156
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,167
- Yeah, and all this time

157
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:43,367
I thought you some kind of
 crush on me, or something!

158
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:46,800
(mellow orchestral music)

159
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,967
- Well, everything's back
 to normal again, it seems.

160
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,933
(alarm blaring)

161
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:56,167
- Now, what is that?

162
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:59,067
- Uh-oh, clogged
 intake valve, hmm.

163
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,200
Must have time barnacles.

164
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,867
All right Josh, come on,
 cut the forward thrusters.

165
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:09,833
- Um, time barnacles, huh?

166
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,100
I thought they only
 grew in the ocean.

167
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,400
- No, no, no, no, no.

168
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,933
No, they're living organisms

169
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:16,333
which are indigenous
 to the Time Stream.

170
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:20,433
It seems that they're drawn
 to all kinds of warm surfaces,

171
00:09:20,433 --> 00:09:22,500
particularly to
 our intake valves.

172
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,967
- It looks as if there's eggs
 stuck in the barnacles it...

173
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,500
- Whoa, look at the
 size of those suckers!

174
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,433
- I've never seen anything
 like these eggs before.

175
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:36,067
Better get them in
 to inspect them.

176
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:37,900
- Are you certain that
 is the correct procedure?

177
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,867
After all, we have
 no idea what reaction

178
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:41,233
these alien eggs will have

179
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:43,467
to the oxygenated
 atmosphere of the Time Pod.

180
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:44,500
- Yeah lady, think
 what we could learn

181
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
from examining these eggs!

182
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,833
Besides, we'll have to clean
 out the intake valve anyway.

183
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,533
- Yeah, would you let
 the man do his job!

184
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:54,600
I mean, after all,
 they look pretty cool!

185
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,267
- Bring 'em in Josh.

186
00:09:56,267 --> 00:09:58,200
(ethereal orchestral music)

187
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,967
(eggs squeaking and purring)

188
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:09,033
(device beeping and ringing)

189
00:10:09,033 --> 00:10:09,867
Amazing!

190
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:13,100
According to my reading,

191
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,333
these eggs date at
 70 million years BC!

192
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:20,400
- Wow!

193
00:10:21,533 --> 00:10:24,933
They're like pre,
 pre, prehistoric eggs!

194
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:26,700
They must of gotten
sucked into hyper-time,

195
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,867
and then attached to
 those time barnacles.

196
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:31,867
- I suggest we
 proceed with caution.

197
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,367
(eggs squeaking and purring)

198
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,767
- What's that noise?

199
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:37,100
(Prism chattering)

200
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,600
What's up, buddy?

201
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,267
- The eggs, they're moving!

202
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:43,867
- No, they're hatching!

203
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:47,700
(eggs squeaking and purring)

204
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,633
(suspenseful orchestral music)

205
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:57,667
(worms purring and chattering)

206
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,867
(whimsical orchestral music)

207
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:27,233
(Prism chattering)

208
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:29,267
- Hey, what's wrong?

209
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:31,267
What's wrong with Prism?

210
00:11:32,133 --> 00:11:34,700
- Oh, he remembers Bartholomew.

211
00:11:36,633 --> 00:11:37,767
- Bartholo-who?

212
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:39,433
- Bartholomew.

213
00:11:39,433 --> 00:11:41,767
My boa constrictor.

214
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:43,667
You see, before I made
 your acquaintances,

215
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,233
I kept a pet snake.

216
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:50,967
The deluded creature once
 tried to ingest Prism.

217
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:51,800
Whole.

218
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,267
(mellow orchestral music)

219
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:56,967
Since then, anything
 that wriggles

220
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,567
gives Prism the heebie-jeebies.

221
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:02,400
(whimsical orchestral music)

222
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,633
- Oh, this is too cool!

223
00:12:04,633 --> 00:12:06,067
Wow!

224
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:07,600
- Amazing!

225
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,700
Look how they interact,
even at infancy.

226
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,633
- Not to worry, Prism.

227
00:12:12,633 --> 00:12:16,400
(whimsical orchestral music)

228
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:23,200
They seem harmless enough.

229
00:12:24,633 --> 00:12:28,300
(chuckles) I must apologize,
 it appears I was mistaken.

230
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,267
- Mistaken?

231
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:32,367
No, it happens all the time.

232
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:33,767
Not to me, of course.

233
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:37,233
(worms cooing and chattering)

234
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:39,067
- Oh, come on.

235
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,467
Come on!

236
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:44,200
(whimsical orchestral music)

237
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,900
- Look at him!

238
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,400
(laughing)

239
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,267
He's a girl!

240
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:54,500
(laughing)

241
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,700
Hey, where you goin' to?

242
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,400
(worm cooing and chattering)

243
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,567
- Oh, oh, oh! (screams)

244
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:11,400
(screaming)

245
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,433
- What's happening?

246
00:13:12,433 --> 00:13:13,433
Get off of her!

247
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:15,400
- Oh, it's tickling me!

248
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,567
It's tickling me and I
 can't stop! (screams)

249
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,733
- Give her to me, here,
 here, here, here, here, here.

250
00:13:25,733 --> 00:13:28,400
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
 settle down, settle down!

251
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,333
Hey, why'd you do that?

252
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,667
How 'bout that?

253
00:13:32,667 --> 00:13:34,733
A fate worse than death!

254
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:36,967
Hey, here come here.

255
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:39,200
Come here, oh buddy.

256
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,600
Oh, you're heavy!

257
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:45,767
Hey, where're you
 from, little guy?

258
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,800
(Prism chattering)

259
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,533
(Prism groaning)

260
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,700
(suspenseful orchestral music)

261
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,133
- Solid titanium!

262
00:14:02,667 --> 00:14:04,933
- Those little critters...

263
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:08,600
(worms cooing and chattering)

264
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,100
(suspenseful orchestral music)

265
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,400
(electrical arcing)

266
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,067
(alarm blaring)
 - Are feeding on the Time Pod!

267
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:17,333
- Oh no!

268
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:21,067
(frenetic orchestral music)
 (alarm blaring)

269
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,167
- Where are they now?

270
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:27,700
- They're everywhere!

271
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,867
(alarm blaring)
 (frenetic orchestral music)

272
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,100
- That's awful, they're
eating everything!

273
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,533
- Oh, are there any other

274
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:42,400
intellectual observations
 you'd like to make?

275
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,833
- Hey, what are we gonna do?

276
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,500
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking!

277
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,733
- Well think harder,
 we're in trouble!

278
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:48,667
- We're losing control!

279
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:49,600
(engine exploding)

280
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,600
(frenetic orchestral music)

281
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,533
(electrics arcing)
 (alarm blaring)

282
00:14:57,533 --> 00:14:59,667
- The structural
 frame of the Time Pod,

283
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:01,833
if that goes, we're doomed!

284
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,933
(alarm blaring)

285
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:07,500
- They're going after
 The Nullifier pieces!

286
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,267
(frenetic orchestral music)

287
00:15:11,267 --> 00:15:14,267
(laughing)

288
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:17,200
- No, they musn't get hold
 of The Nullifier components!

289
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,067
- Rip.

290
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:18,867
Your.

291
00:15:18,867 --> 00:15:19,700
Head.

292
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,067
Off!

293
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:24,633
(laughing and screaming)

294
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:26,433
- (groans) Ow!

295
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:29,267
- Thank you very
 much, Josh Kirby!

296
00:15:29,267 --> 00:15:33,167
I hope to repay you
for the favor some day!

297
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:36,400
- Josh, for all our sakes
 come and grab this arm,

298
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,333
we're losing our trajectory!

299
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,400
Grab the arm!

300
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,500
(alarm blaring)

301
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
(cosmic shocking)

302
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,800
- Oh-Oh!

303
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,467
(alarm blaring)

304
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,400
- Wait, crash positions
everybody, hold on!

305
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,833
- Quick, under the
 console, hurry!

306
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,133
- Josh, put her next
 to the Time Pod!

307
00:15:58,133 --> 00:15:59,367
- No!

308
00:15:59,367 --> 00:16:00,767
Oh God!

309
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:03,067
(screaming)

310
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,500
(cosmic thrusting)

311
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,767
(Time Pod crashing)

312
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:16,100
(alarm weakly sounding)

313
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:23,800
(whimsical orchestral music)

314
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,967
(door crashing and hissing)

315
00:16:57,067 --> 00:17:01,067
(worms chattering and purring)

316
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,967
(dramatic orchestral music)
 (worms chattering)

317
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,100
- Even this cold
 doesn't stop them!

318
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,267
- Yeah, how nice for them.

319
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,467
- This cold is somehow familiar.

320
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:45,200
(ethereal orchestral music)

321
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:51,800
(metal creaking and crashing)

322
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
- My beautiful Time Pod!

323
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:55,567
Ruined!

324
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:58,933
(whimsical orchestral music)

325
00:17:58,933 --> 00:18:02,933
Time hopping leeches! (screams)

326
00:18:04,267 --> 00:18:05,100
Oh!

327
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,067
Oh!

328
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:08,900
The years.

329
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:11,067
The sacrifice.

330
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,400
(mellow orchestral music)

331
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,067
Alas, poor Time Pod.

332
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:20,867
I knew its ratios.

333
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:24,367
(mellow orchestral music)

334
00:18:25,533 --> 00:18:29,067
Unfortunately, this
 little development

335
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,267
terminates our objective.

336
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:32,833
Totally.

337
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,700
Unequivocally.

338
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,400
- You mean we're stuck here?

339
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,333
- Only slaves, forever!

340
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:42,367
(worms cooing and chattering)

341
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:45,300
- Hey, they're getting away!

342
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,967
- Good riddance to bad rubbish.

343
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:50,067
(mellow orchestral music)

344
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:52,267
- Maybe all is not for not.

345
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,467
This building is
 somehow familiar.

346
00:18:57,667 --> 00:18:59,567
(suspenseful orchestral music)
 (guns cocking)

347
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,767
- [Soldier] There they are!

348
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:04,267
(suspenseful orchestral music)

349
00:19:04,267 --> 00:19:05,600
- Azabeth Siege!

350
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:11,433
Where in the 12 moons
of Meagan have you been?

351
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:15,600
- Sir, I beg your forgiveness
 for my untimely departure,

352
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,900
and I pray that my actions

353
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,467
will not be deemed treasonous
 to the Codes of Kang,

354
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:21,967
nor his followers.

355
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,867
- Azabeth, who's this clown?

356
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:28,700
- Show some respect, Josh Kirby!

357
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,100
This is Akira Storm,
 Leader of a Thousand,

358
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,767
and keeper of the
 21 Codes of Kang.

359
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:35,333
- Oh!

360
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,433
- Stand woman, and
 give me a look at you.

361
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:40,667
There's no suspicion of treason
to the great resistance,

362
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:42,700
we give humble thanks
to the all-knowing Kang

363
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,667
for bringing you safely
back into the fold.

364
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:49,067
We all feared for the worst
 when you did not return,

365
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:51,833
and now, such a
 dramatic entrance,

366
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:55,233
and at no great expense
 to our secured perimeters.

367
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:58,733
- Quite honestly, my arrival
 here was totally by accident.

368
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,167
We had been wandering
through the Time Stream

369
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,833
for what seemed
 like an eternity,

370
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:06,600
when we happened upon
 a nest of worm's eggs.

371
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
- Worm eggs?

372
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,567
- The eggs hatched
 a pod of worms,

373
00:20:11,567 --> 00:20:12,900
which ate entirely
 through the Time Pod

374
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,000
in which I was traveling.

375
00:20:16,167 --> 00:20:18,800
- Metal-eating worms
 from the Time Stream?

376
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,700
Come now.
 - I swear it by Kang!

377
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,633
- So, where are these worms now?

378
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:26,400
- They seemed to have burrowed
 through into the bedrock.

379
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,000
- And how are they
 to be terminated?

380
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,400
- I'm at a loss for a solution.

381
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,500
- Maybe you could kill
 'em with all that hot air.

382
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,233
- Silence!
 - They are with me.

383
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:38,167
- With you?

384
00:20:39,433 --> 00:20:42,333
- Josh Kirby, the young
one, saved my life.

385
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,100
- Oh, he did, did he?

386
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:47,133
- He's no older than a pup!

387
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:48,400
- Barely older than you

388
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,200
when you joined the
 Great Resistance.

389
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,300
- You compare me to a human?

390
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,000
I fear your time spent
 away from our struggle

391
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,800
was not the most
productive of your life.

392
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,567
- Nonetheless, I am home now,
 and all by their good graces!

393
00:20:59,567 --> 00:21:01,200
- Very well then.

394
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,067
We must discuss battle
 strategies at once.

395
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:05,833
Dreadnaught the
Enslaver and his forces

396
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:09,200
have had us under constant
 siege since your depart.

397
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,933
There's much I have to
 brief you on, let us hurry!

398
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:12,433
- But Commander,
 about the worms I--

399
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:15,233
- I'm afraid there are far
more pressing battles to be won

400
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:18,633
before we can worry
about these, ah, worms.

401
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:19,867
- I--
- I don't know how much

402
00:21:19,867 --> 00:21:23,633
longer we can hold
 Dreadnaught at bay.

403
00:21:23,633 --> 00:21:24,900
Craygar, Valtan!

404
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,167
Secure the breach to
 the exterior walls,

405
00:21:26,167 --> 00:21:28,167
stable the humans
 in the brig then--

406
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:29,967
- Stable the humans?
 - [Soldier] Come on!

407
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:31,300
- Excuse me?

408
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,533
- Akira!

409
00:21:32,533 --> 00:21:33,867
- [Soldier] We should
 search for weapons.

410
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:36,700
- Commander Storm,
 they are with me!

411
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,533
- And we are at war, and I
 cannot compromise this station

412
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,433
by allowing two
 humans to remain free,

413
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:44,533
humans who already infected
 this battle station

414
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:47,667
with some type of a
 metal-corroding parasite.

415
00:21:47,667 --> 00:21:49,333
- Hey!

416
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,667
That was an accident
those things got loose!

417
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:52,900
- For all we know,

418
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,433
they could be spies for
Dreadnaught himself.

419
00:21:54,433 --> 00:21:55,600
- Commander!

420
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,300
- Our last military installation

421
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,533
is on the brink of collapse,

422
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:03,867
and you wanna argue
 about a couple of humans?

423
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:06,367
I will have none of this,
 do you understand me?

424
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,700
- You are the keeper of
the 21 Codes of Kang,

425
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,900
I will obey your orders.

426
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:12,833
- What?

427
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:14,800
How can you do this to us?

428
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,700
- I am bound by duty,
 and the Codes of--

429
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,333
- Codes of Kang to do so, right?

430
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,433
Yeah, I know.

431
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:24,167
Is this how I'm repaid
 for saving your life?

432
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:28,333
- I will do what I can with
 Akira, but we are at war.

433
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,333
- Take them away!

434
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:32,267
Let's go!

435
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,467
- [Soldier] Take his pack!

436
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:35,767
What have we got here?
 (Prism chattering)

437
00:22:35,767 --> 00:22:37,700
- What is going on now?

438
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,100
- [Soldier] Sir, I think you
 should have a look at this.

439
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,067
(Prism chattering)

440
00:22:45,533 --> 00:22:49,167
- Yet another infiltrator
 to undermine our defenses.

441
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,067
Take this malignancy
 into custody,

442
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,100
no doubt the brains
 of the operation.

443
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,767
- What? Brains? Him?

444
00:22:58,367 --> 00:23:01,100
(wind howling)

445
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,967
- Just as I suspected,

446
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:05,500
they're smuggling
 weapons into our complex.

447
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,967
- No, no, no, no, no,
 that is not a weapon!

448
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:10,767
Well I mean, not yet.

449
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:13,367
We have got to find the
other Nullifier pieces--

450
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:14,900
- Nullifier?

451
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,367
I've heard quite enough, take
 them to the brig immediately!

452
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:19,567
Scoddin, take this to our
 science officer at once!

453
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,300
- [Scoddin] Yes, sir!

454
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:26,267
(militaristic orchestral music)

455
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:30,067
- [Soldier] Move along!

456
00:23:30,067 --> 00:23:33,067
(militaristic orchestral music)

457
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:37,167
(moves into ethereal
 orchestral music)

458
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,567
(moves into suspenseful
orchestral music)

459
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,467
(metal crashing)

460
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,733
(groaning)

461
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:43,933
(suspenseful orchestral music)

462
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:47,367
(straining and groaning)

463
00:24:50,567 --> 00:24:54,067
(mellow orchestral music)

464
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,467
- I hate you!

465
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:02,200
(metal clanging)

466
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,800
Blast you!

467
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,967
Cold and uncaring as ever!

468
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:09,867
Untouched, while those
 who follow your call

469
00:25:09,867 --> 00:25:13,567
stand at the brink
 of ruin and death!

470
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:14,900
Well, I am here to tell you,

471
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,667
I am not going to
 stand with them!

472
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:19,500
(glass shattering)

473
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,067
(mellow orchestral music)

474
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:33,667
I've come to renounce you, Kang.

475
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:35,200
Ever since I've been
 with the humans,

476
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,900
all I've been able to think
 about was getting back here,

477
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,067
to my people.

478
00:25:40,867 --> 00:25:43,767
(mellow orchestral music)

479
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:47,367
To the home of Kang,
 the Great Liberator!

480
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:49,300
Well, now I wish
 I'd never come back!

481
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,600
I'm going to leave this
place and this time,

482
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,267
I'm not coming back!

483
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:57,467
(mellow orchestral music)

484
00:25:57,467 --> 00:26:00,667
Your home is where
 you choose to live,

485
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:04,133
and I cannot live in a
 place where my friends

486
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:05,400
are thrown into a prison cell

487
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,400
because of some 100
 year-old prejudice.

488
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,167
I'm going to
 liberate my friends,

489
00:26:11,167 --> 00:26:15,867
and we are going to find
a way off this planet.

490
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:17,100
I'm half human.

491
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,067
Maybe I'll go live with
Josh Kirby on his Earth,

492
00:26:21,067 --> 00:26:23,967
after we've repaired
 the Time Stream.

493
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:27,133
(mellow orchestral music)

494
00:26:27,133 --> 00:26:28,467
As he would say,

495
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:31,100
"I'm outta here!"

496
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,867
(bomb exploding)

497
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:35,900
Oh!

498
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,900
(mellow orchestral music)

499
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,100
Why have the Codes,

500
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,600
which have done so much
good for my people,

501
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,167
serve the humans so poorly?

502
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,167
(mellow orchestral music)

503
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:55,100
And why does this cold planet

504
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,533
have such a hold over my heart?

505
00:26:57,533 --> 00:27:01,067
(mellow orchestral music)

506
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:06,367
I know I can't leave!

507
00:27:08,233 --> 00:27:09,933
But I also know I
 cannot stand here

508
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:12,233
and live with this injustice!

509
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:16,233
(mellow orchestral music)

510
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:18,667
- Josh, will you stop that?

511
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:19,900
- Don't look at me.

512
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,800
(Prism purring and chattering)

513
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,967
(bomb exploding)

514
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:34,967
How are we gonna get outta here?

515
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:38,967
- Oh-ho, how are we going
 to get out of this time?

516
00:27:40,233 --> 00:27:43,300
- Stuck on a planet
 full of Azabeths.

517
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:47,600
Not that that's all
bad, I want you to know.

518
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,800
But some of these people

519
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,567
are colder than an
 ice box in Antarctica.

520
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:53,067
- They don't hold us
 in high regard either.

521
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:57,167
- (exhales) Well, I
 just wanna go home.

522
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,967
I wanna see if my
 dad's all right.

523
00:28:00,967 --> 00:28:02,800
And my friends.

524
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,433
I wanna change my clothes!

525
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,800
And how many
 twisted time periods

526
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,100
can someone save wearing
the same clothes?

527
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,267
Not that many!

528
00:28:16,933 --> 00:28:19,267
(straining)

529
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,867
These bars are as
 tough as steel!

530
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:29,100
- Tougher than steel.

531
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,933
- Oh, hello there
 Benedict Arnold!

532
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:36,933
- I do not understand
 this sarcasm.

533
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:38,600
- Well how 'bout this one?

534
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,933
Hi, you traitor!

535
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,967
- I told you that I would
 do all that I could,

536
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:45,333
but Akira is in a
 difficult position,

537
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,600
and my absence from the fight

538
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,867
may have jeopardized the
situation even further.

539
00:28:48,867 --> 00:28:50,400
- Yeah, I'll bet.

540
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,567
- I must abide by his decisions.

541
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:55,567
Our forces have put
 up an admirable fight,

542
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:59,100
but Dreadnaught pushes ever
 closer to enslaving my people!

543
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,767
This battle station
 is our last hope!

544
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,367
If Dreadnaught succeeds
in breaching the walls

545
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,633
of this fortress, then the last
free survivors of my people

546
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:09,200
will be prey to his vile plans!

547
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,233
- So, let us help!

548
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:12,433
Irwin is now the

549
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:14,300
first most brilliant
man of the 25th century.

550
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,967
- Yes, Josh is quite right.

551
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:18,067
I mean that is, we could be

552
00:29:18,067 --> 00:29:19,833
of invaluable service
 to your fight.

553
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:23,067
- I'm afraid you don't
 know my people very well.

554
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:24,067
Very headstrong.

555
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:24,900
- Oh, no!

556
00:29:26,067 --> 00:29:28,533
- And very wary of outsiders!

557
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,267
It was the colonization
of the planet by humans

558
00:29:30,267 --> 00:29:33,767
that led to the original
enslavement in the 25th century.

559
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:36,100
Kang freed my people,
 and he set about laws

560
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,500
which were intended
 to keep us free!

561
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,867
But now, Dreadnaught
 threatens to destroy

562
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:44,067
all that we have
ever worked for!

563
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:46,533
We will not be enslaved again!

564
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:52,233
I am sorry that I
 have let you down,

565
00:29:52,233 --> 00:29:53,700
but I want you to know

566
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,967
that I continue to honor
 my debt to you, Josh Kirby.

567
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:57,267
- I can tell.

568
00:29:57,267 --> 00:29:58,733
- Do you know that you
 could of been detained

569
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:02,333
outside where the temperature
 is 30 degrees below zero?

570
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:03,267
- Oh, well!

571
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,067
That's cold blooded!

572
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,467
- Any sign of those
 worms from 70 million BC?

573
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:15,900
- I'm afraid not.

574
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,400
- Well, maybe
 that's a good sign,

575
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,233
they could of dug deep into
 the bedrock of the planet

576
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:20,867
and made themselves
 a nest there.

577
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:22,367
- Or they could be
weakening the foundation

578
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,800
of our installation as we
 speak, and bring us crashing

579
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,767
into the center of
 the Earth with them!

580
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:29,000
- No, that would
 seem highly unlikely.

581
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,333
- With you two around,

582
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:33,200
nothing I could imagine
is highly unlikely!

583
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,000
- Azabeth, could you tell me

584
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,300
about the timeline
 inconsistency in your era?

585
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,700
- No.
 - Why not?

586
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,767
You can trust us!

587
00:30:41,767 --> 00:30:43,800
- Look Azabeth, please!

588
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,967
You must know how the timeline
 has been altered here.

589
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,333
- I only meant to say

590
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,200
that there are no
 inconsistencies to report.

591
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,033
- What?

592
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:57,900
But every place we've been
 to so far has reported

593
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,400
gross abnormalities in
 the Time Stream continuum.

594
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,800
- I have noticed
nothing here to support

595
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,667
the Zoetrope Time
 Continuum Effect!

596
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:07,867
- Do not refer to it by
that name ever again!

597
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:10,067
It is not his
 continuum to affect!

598
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:12,100
So, it follows suit that he
 certainly doesn't deserve

599
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,767
any credit on time
 theories derived from it!

600
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:19,433
Ugh, even in death he
 continues to haunt me!

601
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,933
- Wait a second.

602
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:25,267
I thought that everything

603
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:27,400
that existed before
 the time scramble

604
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,067
was supposed to be
 freaked outta control.

605
00:31:30,067 --> 00:31:30,900
Right?

606
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,533
I mean, maybe we did it!

607
00:31:32,533 --> 00:31:34,567
Maybe we fixed the
 time continuum!

608
00:31:34,567 --> 00:31:36,100
- I wouldn't count on it, lad.

609
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,933
A more probable hypothesis is

610
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:41,233
that Azabeth's world
 was actually created

611
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,867
as a result of the time
 scramble, as you call it.

612
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:45,067
- What are you saying?

613
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:48,633
- Maybe this place
would never have existed

614
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:51,800
were it not for
 Zoetrope's evil plan.

615
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,767
- That is madness, my people
have been around for millennia!

616
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:57,600
- Millennia, seconds. (clicks)

617
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,400
What's the difference?

618
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:04,667
- Well, at least Zoetrope
 did one thing right.

619
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:07,300
- Look, I entirely understand
 the position you're in,

620
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,600
but you simply have
 to get us out of here!

621
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,267
For every second we
waste away in this cell,

622
00:32:13,267 --> 00:32:14,733
some buffoon could
 be tampering with

623
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:17,767
The Nullifier pieces
 to disastrous effect!

624
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:20,667
- Seconds, millennia. (clicks)

625
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:22,367
What's the difference?

626
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:23,200
- Azabeth.

627
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,467
Time is running out.

628
00:32:29,433 --> 00:32:33,600
- (sighs) I'll
 see what I can do.

629
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:39,400
- Well, gotta look
 on the bright side.

630
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,067
- I wasn't aware
 that there is one.

631
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:44,267
- Well, we don't have
 to watch our backs

632
00:32:44,267 --> 00:32:47,233
for that slime ball
 Zoetrope anymore.

633
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:52,433
(exhaling)

634
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:56,367
(suspenseful orchestral music)

635
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,733
- What a way to go,

636
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:05,667
impaled on an alien cactus.

637
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:09,567
Of all the rotten luck in
 the Galaxy, I cannot believe.

638
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:10,900
Hey!

639
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,667
(creature growling)

640
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:16,433
I am not dead yet
 you scavengers!

641
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,767
(Zoetrope groaning)
 (creature growling)

642
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:22,700
Ow!

643
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,500
(suspenseful orchestral music)

644
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:30,967
Hey.

645
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:33,200
Hey!

646
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,067
Come back!

647
00:33:35,567 --> 00:33:36,400
Come back!

648
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,600
(soldiers chattering)

649
00:33:45,433 --> 00:33:49,600
(transformer exploding)
(electrical arcing)

650
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:52,100
- Miss the thrill of battle?

651
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,400
- Believe me, I've had my share

652
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,967
of battles in the Time Stream.

653
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:56,733
- The Shibonian shields
are losing their power

654
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:59,100
at a rate of 17%
 per quarter, sir.

655
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,867
- Divert one-half the auxiliary
cells to shield power,

656
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:02,567
and restrict all
 non-delineated sources

657
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:04,333
through the auxiliary
 house until further notice.

658
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,267
- Yes, sir.

659
00:34:07,167 --> 00:34:09,433
- Our cargo bay is reporting
 massive disruption,

660
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:11,200
and disincorporation
 on three quarters

661
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,100
of our operational fleet.

662
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,800
- Disincorporation?

663
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,100
Justify.

664
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,167
- Well sir...

665
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,100
- Yes?

666
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,833
- The ships have
been eaten, sir.

667
00:34:24,867 --> 00:34:25,700
- What?

668
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,633
- That's what they report, sir.

669
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:30,233
- All right then, quarantine
 the cargo bay at once,

670
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:32,600
and disinfect the entire
 hanger from top to bottom.

671
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,400
- [Female Soldier] Yes, sir.

672
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,833
- Compliments of your
 Josh Kirby, no doubt.

673
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,867
- It was an accident, Commander!

674
00:34:39,867 --> 00:34:42,600
- Aye, one that might
 cost us our freedom.

675
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,433
(metal snapping)

676
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:44,467
Ah!

677
00:34:44,467 --> 00:34:48,133
(distant laser guns firing)

678
00:34:49,733 --> 00:34:52,367
(whimsical orchestral music)

679
00:34:52,367 --> 00:34:55,600
- Come on, let us outta here!

680
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,167
- Oh give it a rest!

681
00:34:57,167 --> 00:35:00,933
You can't bend the bars
with your bare hands.

682
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,267
- Well, we've
 gotta do something.

683
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:08,233
They could keep us
 in this cage forever!

684
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,067
I won't make it to
 the junior prom,

685
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:13,233
I won't even make
 it to high school!

686
00:35:13,233 --> 00:35:16,900
(dramatic orchestral music)

687
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,667
Oh, forget about it.

688
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,933
(dramatic orchestral music)

689
00:35:22,933 --> 00:35:25,833
(cosmic whooshing)

690
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:30,833
(dramatic orchestral music)

691
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,833
- These bars were solid steel!

692
00:35:40,233 --> 00:35:42,467
- Were is right,
 now they're as rusty

693
00:35:42,467 --> 00:35:44,900
as my dad's old pickup truck.

694
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:49,067
- This section here
 is still in tact,

695
00:35:50,433 --> 00:35:55,133
these where your hands were are
as old and brittle as bones.

696
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:56,800
- How'd it happen?

697
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,300
- You did it!

698
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,067
- Me?
 - Yes, you!

699
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:02,400
Of course, you did it!

700
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,300
This must be another
power of a Time Warrior.

701
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,533
We've yet to even begin

702
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:09,600
to tap into your
 abilities, young man!

703
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,367
It appears you can bend
time with your touch.

704
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,933
- I don't get it, I
 mean, what did I do?

705
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:23,067
- Well you see, your
 simple act of will

706
00:36:23,067 --> 00:36:25,433
manifested a
 temporal acceleration

707
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,733
of the latent protoelec--

708
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:28,467
- In English, please!

709
00:36:28,467 --> 00:36:30,067
- When you touched the bars,

710
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:32,900
you made the metal age
 at an incredible rate,

711
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,733
causing them to rust and
corrode in a matter of seconds.

712
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:38,400
- Oh, get outta here!

713
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,633
- Well now, my boy, we can!

714
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:43,933
Come on, you can use your
 new powers to help Azabeth.

715
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:46,600
- Oh, no I can't, not
 for a while at least.

716
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,800
12 hours, remember?

717
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,500
- Oh yes, you discovered
a Time Warrior

718
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,533
can only use his abilities
 once every 12 hours.

719
00:36:52,533 --> 00:36:54,667
(bomb exploding)

720
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:56,767
- Oh man, it sounds like they're
taking a beating up there.

721
00:36:56,767 --> 00:36:59,867
- Yeah, so let's go help them!

722
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:02,067
- Yeah, Azabeth needs me.

723
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:03,133
- Thatta boy!

724
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:05,833
(triumphant orchestral music)

725
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:07,467
- [Josh] Let's go!

726
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:09,200
(triumphant orchestral music)

727
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,433
(Prism purring and chattering)
 (cosmic whooshing)

728
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:14,933
(somber orchestral music)

729
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:30,567
(worm cooing and chattering)
 (soldier gasping)

730
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:34,500
(suspenseful orchestral music)

731
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:46,900
(soldier groaning)

732
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,933
- This is Sentry Fallon,
I spotted them, sir,

733
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:49,933
I spotted the worms!

734
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:51,100
- [Akira] What's
their direction?

735
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,800
- Traveling west
 towards the brig, sir.

736
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,167
- [Akira] They're in cahoots
 with that Josh Kirby,

737
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:55,400
I knew it!

738
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,633
Keep me posted as to
 their whereabouts,

739
00:37:56,633 --> 00:37:58,633
and try and cut them
 off at Sector 11.

740
00:37:58,633 --> 00:37:59,833
- Will do, sir, I--

741
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:01,900
(metal clanging)
 (electrical arcing)

742
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,100
(creature growling and grunting)

743
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,967
- [Zoetrope] Come on.

744
00:38:04,967 --> 00:38:06,300
Come on, boy.

745
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,800
(creature growling and grunting)

746
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,900
Nice tasty biscuit,
 just gimme a hand.

747
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,933
Come on, you can do it!

748
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:15,733
You can do it.

749
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:18,767
Just gimme a hand, and
 you can have the biscuit.

750
00:38:18,767 --> 00:38:20,433
Ooh, ooh, that's it!

751
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:22,467
(creature growling and grunting)

752
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,300
(sniffing)

753
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,533
Mmm, smells good, ooh.

754
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:27,767
(hand slapping)
Ouch!

755
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:30,233
(creature growling and grunting)

756
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:31,533
Come on!

757
00:38:31,533 --> 00:38:33,067
Come on!

758
00:38:33,067 --> 00:38:37,100
Come on, nice fresh tomato
 biscuit, hard as a rock.

759
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,433
It's good for your
 teeth, though!

760
00:38:38,433 --> 00:38:40,867
Come on, ooh, it's delicious.

761
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:45,100
My, what strong lookin'
shoulders you have.

762
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,367
Oops!

763
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,100
(grunting and struggling)

764
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,767
(dramatic orchestral music)

765
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:57,133
Yeah, yeah you can
 have the other half,

766
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:02,967
after you get these
 splinters out of my back!

767
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,867
(distant laser guns firing)

768
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:31,333
(bomb exploding)
 (glass shattering)

769
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:33,667
- So much misery these days,

770
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,467
and so much mistrust.

771
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:39,667
(metal shattering)

772
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:41,900
(exhaling)

773
00:39:45,933 --> 00:39:49,767
You've outdone yourself
this time, Josh Kirby.

774
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,667
But what can I do
 to help you now?

775
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:56,400
Akira would never
understand your methods,

776
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,467
nor would he tolerate
 our wisecracks.

777
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,900
I barely do.

778
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,867
(distant laser guns firing)

779
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:12,500
But I do owe you my
 life, Josh Kirby,

780
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,733
and I will see to it that
 you are freed as well!

781
00:40:15,733 --> 00:40:17,967
(groaning)

782
00:40:19,267 --> 00:40:21,767
Just as soon as I free myself!

783
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:24,833
(metal creaking and crashing)

784
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:27,167
Ooh, those abominable worms!

785
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,367
(grunting)
(buzzer buzzing)

786
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:35,500
I will get you for
 this, Josh Kirby!

787
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,100
(cosmic whooshing)

788
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:41,767
(dramatic orchestral music)

789
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,167
(soldiers chattering)

790
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,633
- Do you really think
 you can fend off me,

791
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:55,667
Dreadnaught the Enslaver,
 for very much longer?

792
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:57,333
- For as long as it takes.

793
00:40:57,333 --> 00:41:00,733
(transformer exploding)
(electrical arcing)

794
00:41:00,733 --> 00:41:03,467
(laughing)

795
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:05,500
- But no luck to your defense
 shields, that won't be long.

796
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,067
(electrical arcing)

797
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:08,533
- Now you listen to me!

798
00:41:08,533 --> 00:41:10,600
(metal creaking and shattering)

799
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,700
- (laughs) No, you listen to me!

800
00:41:15,833 --> 00:41:17,400
You can barely keep
your equipment together,

801
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,833
let alone defender
 for all your people!

802
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:22,567
I offer you a choice,

803
00:41:23,667 --> 00:41:26,767
Akira Storm, the
 Leader of a Thousand.

804
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:32,200
This is your last chance.

805
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,067
Say the word, and Ill
 call off the attack

806
00:41:35,067 --> 00:41:36,900
and spare your people.

807
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,633
In exchange for them
agreeing to be my slaves

808
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:42,967
for the rest of their
 days, of course.

809
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,633
- That is no choice.

810
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,067
- Precisely!

811
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:49,400
(door whirring)

812
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,233
Oh!

813
00:41:51,533 --> 00:41:54,533
The lovely, and
 volatile Miss Siege!

814
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:00,133
Oh, how I'm going
 to enjoy owning you!

815
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,433
Come on!

816
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,333
(laughing)

817
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,133
(energetic orchestral music)

818
00:42:06,133 --> 00:42:07,633
- [Soldier] Be careful!

819
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:08,467
- What?

820
00:42:09,667 --> 00:42:11,700
- End holographic
 transmission, sir.

821
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:14,300
- I can see that, thank you!

822
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,433
(distant laser guns firing)

823
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,500
And what do you want?

824
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,700
- I'd like to have a word with
 you, regarding Josh Kirby.

825
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,867
- Why, is there something else
 of mine he'd like to destroy?

826
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:29,733
(ethereal orchestral music)

827
00:42:29,733 --> 00:42:32,567
(worm chattering)

828
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:39,167
(suspenseful orchestral music)

829
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:46,833
- They're swarming
 all around us.

830
00:42:46,833 --> 00:42:49,167
Do you think they've
 discovered that we're gone?

831
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,367
- They're too engrossed
with The Enslaver

832
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,133
to worry about us, yet.

833
00:42:52,133 --> 00:42:55,800
(Prism cooing and chattering)

834
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,133
- [Josh] What's with Prism?

835
00:42:58,133 --> 00:43:00,567
(Prism cooing and chattering)

836
00:43:00,567 --> 00:43:04,067
- He's not lit up
 this brightly since

837
00:43:04,067 --> 00:43:07,633
- The last Nullifier piece!
 - The last Nullifier piece!

838
00:43:07,633 --> 00:43:09,067
It must be down the worm hole.

839
00:43:09,067 --> 00:43:12,467
- I think the worms are
attracted to The Nullifier, too.

840
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:14,633
- Just like rats to cheese!

841
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,067
- [Soldier] It must be
coming from over there.

842
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:17,467
- Where?
 - Right off there.

843
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:19,100
- On the wall there?
 - [Soldier] Yes.

844
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,633
- Quick, down the worm hole.

845
00:43:21,633 --> 00:43:25,533
(suspenseful orchestral music)

846
00:43:38,967 --> 00:43:40,567
Come on!

847
00:43:40,567 --> 00:43:42,700
- You all right, Josh?

848
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,067
I'm coming down!

849
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:48,400
All right, Prism!

850
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,533
Prism, close your eyes!
- Jump!

851
00:43:50,533 --> 00:43:52,167
(Prism cooing and chattering)

852
00:43:52,167 --> 00:43:53,700
- Good!

853
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,333
Josh, this is the
 ventilation system,

854
00:43:57,333 --> 00:44:01,333
this will give us access
to the entire fortress!

855
00:44:07,067 --> 00:44:09,500
(dramatic orchestral music)

856
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,433
(creature grunting and cooing)

857
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:24,900
(creature cooing)

858
00:44:26,067 --> 00:44:30,133
(creature growling and grunting)

859
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:35,933
(Prism cooing and chattering)

860
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,500
- Well, we've gotta be close.

861
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,367
(Prism cooing and chattering)

862
00:44:44,367 --> 00:44:45,867
Maybe up here.

863
00:44:45,867 --> 00:44:49,533
(Prism cooing and chattering)

864
00:44:49,533 --> 00:44:53,200
(dramatic orchestral music)

865
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:56,767
- Will you look at that!

866
00:44:58,067 --> 00:44:59,833
- It's okay, Prism.

867
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:00,700
I think.

868
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:06,067
Look the worms are glued
to The Nullifier piece.

869
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:08,233
Just like moths to a flame!

870
00:45:08,233 --> 00:45:09,733
- Being close to The
 Nullifier component

871
00:45:09,733 --> 00:45:12,600
seems to have sequestered
 their appetite.

872
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,833
- That's it!

873
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:15,233
- That's it, what's it?

874
00:45:15,233 --> 00:45:18,167
I've heard your
 "That's it," before.

875
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,500
- I have a plan!

876
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,400
- Oh-ho no, I thought
 I was supposed

877
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,900
to be the brains of this outfit!

878
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,100
- Look I'm telling you,

879
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,067
I know how to round
 up all the worms

880
00:45:27,067 --> 00:45:29,567
before they can
 do anymore damage!

881
00:45:29,567 --> 00:45:31,900
First I need Azabeth.

882
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,500
- How?

883
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:38,133
If the guards see us, they'll
 throw us back into the brig!

884
00:45:38,133 --> 00:45:40,600
- You're the brains of this
 outfit, you figure it out.

885
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,533
Let's go!

886
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:45,700
(worms cooing and purring)

887
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,367
- I have more than proven myself

888
00:45:47,367 --> 00:45:49,833
to this squadron and
 to the Laws of Kang!

889
00:45:49,833 --> 00:45:51,067
I demand that you release

890
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:52,633
Josh Kirby and the
 others immediately!

891
00:45:52,633 --> 00:45:55,533
- You are in no position to
 demand anything, young lady!

892
00:45:55,533 --> 00:45:58,867
- I am not a young
 lady, Commander!

893
00:45:58,867 --> 00:46:01,567
I am a Warrior, and I
shall be treated as one!

894
00:46:01,567 --> 00:46:03,067
- And where did you acquire

895
00:46:03,067 --> 00:46:05,367
such insolence for your
 Commanding Officers, hmm?

896
00:46:05,367 --> 00:46:08,600
Surely that is not
 of the ways of Kang.

897
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:14,667
- Uh-Oh!

898
00:46:18,633 --> 00:46:20,833
- You sure?
 - Of course I'm sure!

899
00:46:20,833 --> 00:46:22,567
My keen sense of
 direction has no equal

900
00:46:22,567 --> 00:46:25,333
in this, or any
 century, anymore.

901
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:27,600
Well, maybe this way.

902
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,700
- [Azabeth] How dare you!

903
00:46:30,567 --> 00:46:31,967
- Do you hear that?

904
00:46:31,967 --> 00:46:32,800
- Yes!

905
00:46:36,267 --> 00:46:38,900
- [Akira] I cannot believe you
 are even saying these words!

906
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,933
These humans have been
here less than 12 hours,

907
00:46:40,933 --> 00:46:42,567
and they've already
 caused as much damage

908
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:45,067
as Dreadnaught's entire army!

909
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:46,667
They will be
 confined to the brig

910
00:46:46,667 --> 00:46:49,433
until I decide
 otherwise, is that clear?

911
00:46:49,433 --> 00:46:51,067
- I cannot stand idly
 by as my friends,

912
00:46:51,067 --> 00:46:53,300
who have proven their worth
 and valor many times over,

913
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,300
rot away in some jail cell!

914
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,167
- Compassion for humans?

915
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:59,867
Isn't this a pretty
 little turn of events?

916
00:46:59,867 --> 00:47:01,567
My how you've changed!

917
00:47:01,567 --> 00:47:06,167
I barely know you at all
 Azabeth Siege, my betrothed.

918
00:47:06,167 --> 00:47:07,933
- Wait a minute!

919
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:09,267
She's gonna marry that tweeb?

920
00:47:09,267 --> 00:47:10,667
- Shhh!

921
00:47:10,667 --> 00:47:12,100
- I have changed.

922
00:47:13,533 --> 00:47:15,700
How could I not when I've been
 exposed to ideals and worlds

923
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,767
that you haven't
even dreamed of?

924
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:21,733
- And what of these
 ideals have you seen?

925
00:47:21,733 --> 00:47:23,733
- That we have been hardened,

926
00:47:23,733 --> 00:47:26,633
conditioned by centuries
 of fighting and conflict.

927
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:29,300
(bomb exploding)

928
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,300
- Our ways are suddenly
barbaric to you?

929
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,067
Maybe you would prefer
 the life of a slave!

930
00:47:33,067 --> 00:47:35,067
- That is not my point!

931
00:47:35,067 --> 00:47:38,067
I am a Warrior, be it in
this time, or any other!

932
00:47:38,067 --> 00:47:39,800
But what I have learned is that
not everything can be solved

933
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,467
through the slash of a sword,
 or the blast of a fist!

934
00:47:42,467 --> 00:47:44,333
- And this Josh Kirby of
yours, he's taught you

935
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:46,800
all these things that
I could not understand?

936
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,067
This child?

937
00:47:48,067 --> 00:47:50,333
- Have you forgotten
 the 10th Code of Kang?

938
00:47:50,333 --> 00:47:53,167
"One who is young in years,
 may be old in wisdom."

939
00:47:53,167 --> 00:47:55,700
This child, is wiser
 than many I have known

940
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,933
who are twice his age.

941
00:47:57,933 --> 00:48:00,900
- You dare quote the
 sacred Codes to me?

942
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,433
This discussion is finished!

943
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:05,300
- You must release them!

944
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,633
- [Akira] And if I refuse?

945
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:07,967
- Then you will prove
 to all that can hear

946
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:09,467
that the mighty
 Leader of a Thousand

947
00:48:09,467 --> 00:48:11,900
is blinded by petty jealousy.

948
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:15,567
- Me, jealous of that twerp?

949
00:48:15,567 --> 00:48:18,633
- I owe that twerp my life.

950
00:48:18,633 --> 00:48:21,567
- Regardless, we are
 in a combat situation,

951
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:23,067
and all full-blooded humans

952
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,067
will be confined to the
 brig until further notice.

953
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:29,167
Now, if you'll excuse me,
 I'm trying to save my planet!

954
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,600
- Caloong on star!

955
00:48:34,067 --> 00:48:37,633
(ominous orchestral music)

956
00:48:40,733 --> 00:48:41,733
- Excuse me?

957
00:48:43,133 --> 00:48:45,233
- I said caloong on star.

958
00:48:47,067 --> 00:48:50,600
(ominous orchestral music)

959
00:48:51,933 --> 00:48:54,700
I demand a Request of Honor.

960
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,700
If you will not honor my
request for my friend's freedom,

961
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,067
then you leave me no choice.

962
00:49:00,133 --> 00:49:01,233
- Are you mad?

963
00:49:02,633 --> 00:49:03,533
- I am not.

964
00:49:08,067 --> 00:49:08,967
- So be it.

965
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,267
Prepare the arena!

966
00:49:12,267 --> 00:49:13,600
Caloong on star.

967
00:49:15,467 --> 00:49:17,800
(screaming)

968
00:49:19,133 --> 00:49:20,400
- Oh!
 - Oh!

969
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,567
Now I think they'll
 know we've escaped.

970
00:49:24,733 --> 00:49:28,700
(Prism whimpering
 and chattering)

971
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,333
(worms cooing and chattering)

972
00:49:40,967 --> 00:49:45,067
- Oh, this is great,
 this is just great!

973
00:49:45,067 --> 00:49:46,467
Go to jail, right?

974
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,567
Go directly to jail!

975
00:49:48,567 --> 00:49:50,633
Do not pass go, and do
 not collect $200.00.

976
00:49:50,633 --> 00:49:52,633
- Take them away!

977
00:49:52,633 --> 00:49:53,867
- Now wait!

978
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:55,100
You gotta listen
 to us, all right?

979
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:55,933
We found a way to--

980
00:49:55,933 --> 00:49:57,300
- Silence!

981
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,800
Your interference has
disrupted my plans long enough!

982
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,967
Besides, Azabeth has bespoken
 a request on your behalf,

983
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,767
you're free to go until
 the time of the testament.

984
00:50:09,767 --> 00:50:12,767
I must go prepare,
 farewell my love.

985
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:17,933
When next we meet, 'twill
 be for the last time.

986
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,033
- Jeez!

987
00:50:23,033 --> 00:50:24,833
- Jeez Louise!

988
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:26,633
What was that all about?

989
00:50:26,633 --> 00:50:29,633
Is that guy a killjoy or what?

990
00:50:29,633 --> 00:50:31,267
All it was was a little request.

991
00:50:31,267 --> 00:50:32,100
- No!

992
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:35,600
No little request.

993
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,867
The Request for Honor is a
 sacred method among my people

994
00:50:37,867 --> 00:50:42,033
of defending one's convictions,
it is a fight to the death.

995
00:50:43,567 --> 00:50:45,300
- That is absolutely

996
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:48,433
the most ridiculous thing
 I've ever heard you say,

997
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:51,400
and trust me, you've come up
 with some doozies in your day!

998
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,133
Fight to the death?

999
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,733
There's no way I...

1000
00:50:54,733 --> 00:50:56,500
You can't do it!

1001
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:57,333
- I must.

1002
00:50:57,333 --> 00:50:58,867
- No!

1003
00:50:58,867 --> 00:51:00,400
You march right back to
 your quarters, young lady!

1004
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,500
You can't fight with that
 guy, he'll murder you!

1005
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,300
- I agree with Josh!

1006
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:08,433
We'll just place ourselves
 under house arrest.

1007
00:51:08,433 --> 00:51:10,933
- The request has been sealed,

1008
00:51:10,933 --> 00:51:15,500
and Akira's honor as a
 commander is at stake here.

1009
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:18,500
Noble though your
 intentions may be,

1010
00:51:19,533 --> 00:51:22,200
I'm obligated to fight anyway.

1011
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,233
- What?

1012
00:51:23,233 --> 00:51:25,867
(ominous orchestral music)

1013
00:51:25,867 --> 00:51:27,267
- Azabeth!

1014
00:51:27,267 --> 00:51:30,867
(ominous orchestral music)

1015
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,433
I can't honestly believe
you're going through with this.

1016
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:45,167
- I honestly have
 no alternative.

1017
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:48,900
It is the way of my people.

1018
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,067
I'm fighting for your freedom.

1019
00:51:54,067 --> 00:51:57,067
It is no less than what
you would do for me.

1020
00:51:57,067 --> 00:51:59,333
- Yeah, but Azabeth!

1021
00:51:59,333 --> 00:52:00,300
- Isn't it?

1022
00:52:04,267 --> 00:52:05,867
- I wanna help you.

1023
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:08,367
- Then say a prayer.

1024
00:52:08,367 --> 00:52:11,967
(ominous orchestral music)

1025
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,100
(moves into energetic
 orchestral music)

1026
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,367
- [Spectator] Akira!

1027
00:52:20,367 --> 00:52:22,200
Strike the first blow!

1028
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:32,600
- I can't use my
powers to help Azabeth,

1029
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,767
it's only been eight hours,
 not enough time's gone by!

1030
00:52:37,833 --> 00:52:40,333
- All we can do now, is watch.

1031
00:52:42,867 --> 00:52:44,133
Come on, Prism.

1032
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,433
(spectators chattering)

1033
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:55,067
(horns blaring)

1034
00:52:55,067 --> 00:52:57,567
- [Spectator] Okay, all right!

1035
00:53:04,233 --> 00:53:07,833
(ominous orchestral music)

1036
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,567
- May Kang be at your side.

1037
00:53:26,567 --> 00:53:28,100
- And at yours.

1038
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,700
(ominous orchestral music)

1039
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,600
- [Spectator] Let's go!

1040
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:44,300
(Prism chattering)

1041
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:48,267
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1042
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:51,867
(spectators yelling
 and cheering)

1043
00:53:51,867 --> 00:53:53,967
(metal clanging)

1044
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:57,367
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1045
00:53:57,367 --> 00:54:00,400
(spectators cheering)

1046
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,767
(grunting and straining)

1047
00:54:12,367 --> 00:54:16,467
- Congratulations, Commander,
 you struck first blood.

1048
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:18,733
- You've gone soft in your
 time spent with the humans,

1049
00:54:18,733 --> 00:54:21,200
you would not so easily of
 lowered your guard before.

1050
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,333
- I'm glad my wound amuses you.

1051
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:24,867
- I am not amused!

1052
00:54:24,867 --> 00:54:27,067
Your wound pains me twice
 as deeply as it does you,

1053
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:29,067
but your insolence towards
 the Keeper of the Codes

1054
00:54:29,067 --> 00:54:30,333
cannot go unpunished!

1055
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:32,933
- And your arrogance
 must not go unchecked!

1056
00:54:32,933 --> 00:54:35,767
(frenetic orchestral music)

1057
00:54:35,767 --> 00:54:37,267
(spectators cheering)

1058
00:54:37,267 --> 00:54:41,800
I think you've forgotten the
 11th Code of Kang, Akira!

1059
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,267
"An arrogant leader
 defeats his purposes."

1060
00:54:44,267 --> 00:54:48,433
(frenetic orchestral music)
 (spectators cheering)

1061
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:59,433
(swords clanging)
(grunting and screaming)

1062
00:54:59,433 --> 00:55:01,600
(frenetic orchestral music)

1063
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,433
(swords clanging)

1064
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,900
(screaming triumphantly)

1065
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,067
(spectators cheering)

1066
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:17,900
- I wonder, would you fight so
 vehemently for my affections

1067
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,733
as you do the young Josh Kirby?

1068
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:23,200
- I don't fight for
 his affections, you
 simple-minded dolt!

1069
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:25,200
I fight for his freedom!

1070
00:55:26,433 --> 00:55:27,267
- Ee-yah!

1071
00:55:27,267 --> 00:55:29,533
(groaning)

1072
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,133
(crowd cheering and whistling)

1073
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:36,167
You should never of
 come home, Azabeth.

1074
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:37,767
(groaning and straining)

1075
00:55:37,767 --> 00:55:41,433
(frenetic orchestral music)

1076
00:55:48,067 --> 00:55:48,833
- Azabeth!

1077
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,100
- Code of Kang number 17,

1078
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:56,200
"If you're going to
 strike, strike don't talk."

1079
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,667
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1080
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:01,467
- Do it.

1081
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,333
- The caloong on star has ended,

1082
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:06,733
I demand the freedom of Josh
 Kirby and his companions.

1083
00:56:06,733 --> 00:56:08,733
- It shall be done!

1084
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:10,067
(crowd cheering)

1085
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:11,733
(clapping)

1086
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:12,567
Do it!

1087
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,100
- There are far
 more productive uses

1088
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:18,067
of my strength at this moment,

1089
00:56:18,067 --> 00:56:22,200
and for all our sakes, we
 need your strength as well.

1090
00:56:23,533 --> 00:56:26,933
Rise Commander, while
we still have a chance!

1091
00:56:26,933 --> 00:56:28,167
- I beg of you,

1092
00:56:29,333 --> 00:56:31,600
do not let me live
 a weakened man.

1093
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,100
- You will only
 be a weakened man

1094
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,067
if you desert your people
 when they need you most.

1095
00:56:36,067 --> 00:56:40,433
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1096
00:56:40,433 --> 00:56:43,100
(door whirring)

1097
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:49,600
Dreadnaught has penetrated

1098
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,400
the second level of
 our western shields,

1099
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,333
even the third level
 has reported damage.

1100
00:56:56,333 --> 00:57:00,533
Your people need you more
 now than they ever have.

1101
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,833
- My people need a leader
 with a strong heart,

1102
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:08,467
and a clear head, I no
 longer fit that description.

1103
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:09,767
- You are one of
 the finest Warriors

1104
00:57:09,767 --> 00:57:12,300
our history has ever known!

1105
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,967
The caloong on star
 doesn't change that.

1106
00:57:14,967 --> 00:57:16,367
- Oh, really?

1107
00:57:16,367 --> 00:57:18,467
I think everything has changed.

1108
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:21,567
I think we need a new
 Keeper of the Codes.

1109
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:23,933
I plan to go before the War
 Council tomorrow, at dawn,

1110
00:57:23,933 --> 00:57:25,700
to submit my resignation

1111
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:30,500
and I expect they'll choose
 you as the new leader.

1112
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,233
- You can't be serious!

1113
00:57:32,233 --> 00:57:33,800
- Why not?

1114
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,867
Your skills have
 been demonstrated,
 your heart seems set.

1115
00:57:37,867 --> 00:57:40,300
- What are you trying to say?

1116
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,900
- I'm saying that
 you've taken my heart

1117
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,500
and run it through
 with your sword,

1118
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,133
and I can't put my
 mind at the battle

1119
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:51,533
because all I can think about

1120
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,233
is you.

1121
00:57:54,733 --> 00:57:57,067
(mellow orchestral music)

1122
00:57:57,067 --> 00:57:58,133
- I told you,

1123
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:03,167
Josh Kirby is my friend,
and nothing more.

1124
00:58:03,167 --> 00:58:04,667
- I heard your words.

1125
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:08,400
I also see the look in your
 eyes when you're with him.

1126
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,467
You have to make a choice
 between him and me,

1127
00:58:12,467 --> 00:58:14,233
I think you've made it.

1128
00:58:14,233 --> 00:58:17,067
(mellow orchestral music)

1129
00:58:17,067 --> 00:58:20,167
- I can't think about
those choices right now,

1130
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:21,833
and neither can you!

1131
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:24,567
There is only one person
who can save our people

1132
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:25,867
from this terrible
 time right now,

1133
00:58:25,867 --> 00:58:28,700
and he is standing
 right in front of me!

1134
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:31,067
(mellow orchestral music)

1135
00:58:31,067 --> 00:58:33,100
Save us, Akira!

1136
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:37,067
Or I won't have a chance
 to decide upon a husband.

1137
00:58:37,067 --> 00:58:40,533
(mellow orchestral music)

1138
00:58:41,367 --> 00:58:44,067
(door whirring)

1139
00:58:50,567 --> 00:58:53,300
(bomb exploding)

1140
00:58:54,867 --> 00:58:56,633
(door whirring)

1141
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:58,067
- [Soldier] Stand by!

1142
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:01,733
(dramatic orchestral music)

1143
00:59:05,733 --> 00:59:08,900
(soldiers chattering)

1144
00:59:21,367 --> 00:59:24,067
- Well, it's refreshing to see

1145
00:59:24,067 --> 00:59:28,500
that something's been left
unravaged by those demon worms.

1146
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,733
(metal clanging)
(groaning)

1147
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,100
(Prism chattering)

1148
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:37,067
- Look, I'm sorry if I
caused any trouble, sir.

1149
00:59:37,067 --> 00:59:40,067
- Trouble? (laughs)

1150
00:59:43,767 --> 00:59:46,133
- What is the extent of
the damage, Commander?

1151
00:59:46,133 --> 00:59:48,600
- Our airborne fleet has
 been reduced to a dismal few,

1152
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:52,167
and our entire weapons
 deck has been eaten.

1153
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,467
I trust with your freedom
 you've managed to find a way

1154
00:59:55,467 --> 00:59:57,833
to harness these
 pets before they take

1155
00:59:57,833 --> 01:00:00,633
to devouring the very
 flesh from our bones.

1156
01:00:00,633 --> 01:00:03,500
- Well yeah, as a
matter of fact we have.

1157
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:06,067
- Oh, well tell me
 then, I'm all ears!

1158
01:00:06,067 --> 01:00:07,300
(alarm beeping)
 - Incoming message

1159
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:09,367
from Dreadnaught's
 ship, Commander!

1160
01:00:09,367 --> 01:00:11,067
- Bring it down.

1161
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:14,067
(maniacal laughing)

1162
01:00:15,267 --> 01:00:17,000
- I like what you've
 done with the place,

1163
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,700
it suits you! (laughs)

1164
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,233
- I trust you aren't here
 for decorating insights,

1165
01:00:21,233 --> 01:00:22,700
what is it you want?

1166
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,933
- Oh, you know what I want!

1167
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:30,500
The enslavement of your
entire planet. (laughs)

1168
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,833
- Well, you're in a
 chipper mood today.

1169
01:00:32,833 --> 01:00:35,033
- I'm always happy when I win.

1170
01:00:35,033 --> 01:00:37,533
- Oh, but you haven't won yet.

1171
01:00:38,733 --> 01:00:41,167
- Don't threaten me
 with verb tenses.

1172
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:43,733
Win, won, it's all inevitable.

1173
01:00:43,733 --> 01:00:45,600
- If I were you I wouldn't be
 so quick to move in just yet,

1174
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:46,900
or you might find yourself

1175
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,967
at the wrong end of
 an angry laser beam!

1176
01:00:49,967 --> 01:00:51,433
- And if I were you,

1177
01:00:51,433 --> 01:00:54,233
which by the way I thank
 heaven that I'm not! (laughs)

1178
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:56,233
I would hold my threats,

1179
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:01,533
'cause after all, I could
 just as easily kill you,

1180
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:04,200
as to make you my serving boy.

1181
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:08,667
- The day I succumb to
 serving you, is the day I die!

1182
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:11,400
- Well, than that would
be ah, today! (laughs)

1183
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,633
- Blast you Dreadnaught!

1184
01:01:12,633 --> 01:01:14,200
You have not defeated
 us, do you hear me?

1185
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:18,367
Not while there is breath in
 my body, and fire in my soul!

1186
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,500
- Spoken like a desperate man,

1187
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:25,667
if there ever was one.
 (laughs maniacally)

1188
01:01:28,067 --> 01:01:29,567
(fist thudding)

1189
01:01:29,567 --> 01:01:32,067
- [Azabeth] It's not over
 yet, you said so yourself!

1190
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:33,400
- I was bluffing.

1191
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,700
- But what of Josh Kirby's plan?

1192
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:40,067
- Oh that is true, we have not
 heard Josh Kirby's plan yet.

1193
01:01:40,067 --> 01:01:44,500
So tell us, boy, what have you
 in that mind of yours, hmm?

1194
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,767
(laser guns firing)

1195
01:01:46,767 --> 01:01:48,067
- Really?

1196
01:01:48,067 --> 01:01:50,767
- Why not, things
 can't get any worse.

1197
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:51,967
- All right!

1198
01:01:51,967 --> 01:01:53,967
First I need The
 Nullifier components.

1199
01:01:53,967 --> 01:01:55,933
- Of course, we'll use
 your Nullifier weapon

1200
01:01:55,933 --> 01:01:57,367
to destroy Dreadnaught's ship.

1201
01:01:57,367 --> 01:01:58,700
Quotient, bring the
 possessions of the Earthling

1202
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,500
to the Command Center, at once!

1203
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:01,400
- Yes, sir.

1204
01:02:03,533 --> 01:02:05,833
(door whirring)

1205
01:02:05,833 --> 01:02:08,533
- Um, that's not exactly it.

1206
01:02:08,533 --> 01:02:11,867
You see, The Nullifier is
useless without all the pieces,

1207
01:02:11,867 --> 01:02:14,700
and so far, we've
 only found three.

1208
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,500
But for what we need right
 now, three is enough.

1209
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:21,267
This is the cheese that's gonna
lead the rats right to us.

1210
01:02:21,267 --> 01:02:22,467
- Josh Kirby please,

1211
01:02:22,467 --> 01:02:24,400
enough with your 20th
 century metaphors.

1212
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,233
- What?

1213
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:28,833
- The Nullifier's what the
 prehistoric worms are after.

1214
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:31,300
- Now of course, this bizarre
 occurrence leads itself

1215
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,767
to a hypothesis which
 is deeply rooted--

1216
01:02:33,767 --> 01:02:34,767
- Ah, Irwin!

1217
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,300
How long are we gonna keep
 circling this airport, huh?

1218
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:39,533
- Of course!

1219
01:02:39,533 --> 01:02:42,433
Now, you see the worms
are seeking the comfort

1220
01:02:42,433 --> 01:02:45,067
of a blanket from
 their own period,

1221
01:02:45,067 --> 01:02:46,767
which of course is impossible!

1222
01:02:46,767 --> 01:02:48,233
Therefore, they find themselves

1223
01:02:48,233 --> 01:02:51,267
gravitating toward something
 which, like themselves,

1224
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,233
has traveled through time.

1225
01:02:53,233 --> 01:02:55,700
First of all, they fix
 themselves on my Time Pod,

1226
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:58,500
and then onto The
 Nullifier components.

1227
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,267
- Yeah, so we each take
 a piece of the component,

1228
01:03:00,267 --> 01:03:03,067
and we try and draw the worms
 into a central location.

1229
01:03:03,067 --> 01:03:06,233
- And we suggest the
 transportation hangar.

1230
01:03:06,233 --> 01:03:07,467
- Not on your life!

1231
01:03:07,467 --> 01:03:08,733
Those worms have
 already destroyed

1232
01:03:08,733 --> 01:03:11,400
all but one of our air
 fleet, and I will not

1233
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:15,567
jeopardize our only means of
 escape on some human theory!

1234
01:03:19,367 --> 01:03:23,367
What are your thoughts on
 the subject, or dare I ask?

1235
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:26,600
- Well, as a great
 commander once said,

1236
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,600
"Things can't get any worse."

1237
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,600
- Sir, the shear
 generators indicate

1238
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:38,267
that we have just under two
 hours of protection left.

1239
01:03:38,267 --> 01:03:39,100
- Proceed.

1240
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:44,267
And let us pray to
Kang that you're right!

1241
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:47,100
(mellow orchestral music)

1242
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:51,267
(moves into suspenseful
orchestral music)

1243
01:03:53,633 --> 01:03:55,367
- I must say, I was
 very proud of the way

1244
01:03:55,367 --> 01:03:58,067
you handled yourself back there.

1245
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,267
- Well if you must,
 then you should.

1246
01:04:01,267 --> 01:04:03,467
- You've become quite
the Warrior, Josh Kirby.

1247
01:04:03,467 --> 01:04:08,067
Decisive strategist, and
 sometimes almost good company.

1248
01:04:08,067 --> 01:04:10,567
- Well, I haven't
 done anything yet.

1249
01:04:10,567 --> 01:04:12,433
(mellow orchestral music)

1250
01:04:12,433 --> 01:04:14,600
- More than you realize.

1251
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,767
(mellow orchestral music)

1252
01:04:17,767 --> 01:04:20,067
- Let's make our way
back towards the hangar,

1253
01:04:20,067 --> 01:04:23,433
'cause with this Nullifier
 component as bait,

1254
01:04:23,433 --> 01:04:25,200
the worms are
 bound to follow us.

1255
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,067
- Good thinking.

1256
01:04:26,067 --> 01:04:28,100
- Oh! (groans)

1257
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:31,767
(ethereal orchestral music)

1258
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,433
- This is ludicrous.

1259
01:05:05,433 --> 01:05:09,567
Where are those blasted
worms when I need them?

1260
01:05:09,567 --> 01:05:13,833
(dramatic orchestral music)

1261
01:05:13,833 --> 01:05:17,067
(soldiers chattering)

1262
01:05:19,433 --> 01:05:23,100
(distant laser guns firing)

1263
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:30,333
(control console beeping)

1264
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:38,600
- I hope Josh Kirby
 knows what he's doing.

1265
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,800
- I doubt very much that
 he knows what he's doing,

1266
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,700
but he has a plan nonetheless.

1267
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,933
I have traveled down

1268
01:05:45,933 --> 01:05:48,367
the very corridors of
 time with that boy,

1269
01:05:48,367 --> 01:05:49,633
and he's yet to let me down.

1270
01:05:49,633 --> 01:05:52,967
- But on the other hand,
these worms of yours...

1271
01:05:52,967 --> 01:05:54,633
(control panel beeping)

1272
01:05:54,633 --> 01:05:57,800
- Will you stop
 calling them my worms?

1273
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:01,300
They are not my worms!

1274
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,233
I did not create them!

1275
01:06:03,233 --> 01:06:06,900
Not one cubular segment of
 their slimy little bodies!

1276
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,733
They are not my worms!

1277
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,300
Do you understand?

1278
01:06:12,767 --> 01:06:15,133
- It was just a
 figure of speech.

1279
01:06:15,133 --> 01:06:16,200
(exhaling)

1280
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,967
(whimsical orchestral music)

1281
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:26,433
(worms chattering and cooing)

1282
01:06:29,267 --> 01:06:32,067
(screaming)

1283
01:06:32,067 --> 01:06:34,400
(dramatic orchestral music)

1284
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:35,833
- Which way?

1285
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:36,900
- Um...
- Um?

1286
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:38,633
- That way!

1287
01:06:38,633 --> 01:06:39,867
- Now, you're sure?

1288
01:06:39,867 --> 01:06:41,433
- Kang says, "When in
 doubt, turn right."

1289
01:06:41,433 --> 01:06:44,267
- That's a Code of Kang?
- Number seven!

1290
01:06:44,267 --> 01:06:45,600
- [Azabeth] Whoa!
 - [Josh] Hello!

1291
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,100
- [Azabeth] Worms!
 - [Josh] This way!

1292
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:50,767
(dramatic orchestral music)

1293
01:06:56,633 --> 01:07:00,500
(worms cooing and chattering)

1294
01:07:03,867 --> 01:07:05,767
Comin' your way, guys!

1295
01:07:05,767 --> 01:07:08,667
They're right behind us,
and they're movin' fast!

1296
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:10,467
- We're just about ready.

1297
01:07:10,467 --> 01:07:12,367
- [Josh] We don't have
 time for just about, Irwin,

1298
01:07:12,367 --> 01:07:14,133
these worms are on our tail!

1299
01:07:14,133 --> 01:07:16,067
- Look, you worry about
 leading those pestilent things

1300
01:07:16,067 --> 01:07:17,300
up in the right direction,

1301
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,467
let me worry about
 the spacecraft!

1302
01:07:19,467 --> 01:07:21,067
- [Josh] Here we come!

1303
01:07:21,067 --> 01:07:24,900
(dramatic orchestral music)

1304
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,100
- Josh Kirby the
 worms are increasing

1305
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,067
their pursuit of
 The Nullifier piece!

1306
01:07:28,067 --> 01:07:30,333
- The colorful human
 metaphor would be, scram!

1307
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:32,200
(worms chattering)

1308
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,867
(dramatic orchestral music)

1309
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:39,733
Here they come!

1310
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,167
- Make way, here they come!

1311
01:07:44,067 --> 01:07:46,433
It's your plan, it's your piece!

1312
01:07:46,433 --> 01:07:48,767
- Are we set?
 - You bet!

1313
01:07:48,767 --> 01:07:49,967
Now once you're inside,

1314
01:07:49,967 --> 01:07:52,333
press the red button
on the control console,

1315
01:07:52,333 --> 01:07:54,633
this will start the
 launch procedure.

1316
01:07:54,633 --> 01:07:57,333
But be quick, you've
 only got 45 seconds

1317
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:59,700
to get out of the ship and
 behind that hangar door

1318
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,233
before she blasts off!

1319
01:08:01,233 --> 01:08:03,667
- 45 seconds, a piece of cake.

1320
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:05,700
- You realize if you
 fail, you're sending

1321
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:09,567
our last means of escape
right into enemy hands.

1322
01:08:09,567 --> 01:08:13,233
- Relax pal, I'm a
 Time Warrior. (clicks)

1323
01:08:13,233 --> 01:08:16,167
(worms chattering)

1324
01:08:17,933 --> 01:08:19,233
- [Irwin] Professor Quotient.

1325
01:08:19,233 --> 01:08:22,167
(worms chattering)

1326
01:08:25,133 --> 01:08:26,600
- All right, come on!

1327
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,500
Hey you, the ugly one
in the front, let's go!

1328
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,700
Come on, here they are, come on!

1329
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:33,333
(worms chattering)
 (whimsical orchestral music)

1330
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:34,700
Come on.

1331
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:38,567
(worms chattering)
 (whimsical orchestral music)

1332
01:08:56,867 --> 01:08:58,233
(door banging)

1333
01:08:58,233 --> 01:09:02,067
(dramatic orchestral music)
 (worms chattering)

1334
01:09:23,433 --> 01:09:26,833
(engines revving)

1335
01:09:26,833 --> 01:09:28,800
- Come on, Josh.
- Come on, Josh.

1336
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,633
(engines revving)

1337
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,300
- All right.

1338
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,700
All right, come on.

1339
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:37,967
That's good.

1340
01:09:37,967 --> 01:09:40,067
Good, good, just like
 the ABC's, all right.

1341
01:09:40,067 --> 01:09:42,700
(worms chattering)
 (dramatic orchestral music)

1342
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,067
Come on!

1343
01:09:44,067 --> 01:09:46,067
(worms chattering)
 (dramatic orchestral music)

1344
01:09:46,067 --> 01:09:47,367
All right.

1345
01:09:47,367 --> 01:09:51,667
(worms chattering)
 (dramatic orchestral music)

1346
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:53,367
- Hurry up, Josh Kirby!

1347
01:09:53,367 --> 01:09:56,200
(worms cooing)
 (dramatic orchestral music)

1348
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,167
- Oh no!

1349
01:09:57,167 --> 01:09:58,067
No!

1350
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,933
Azabeth, I'm stuck!

1351
01:10:01,933 --> 01:10:05,133
(dramatic orchestral music)

1352
01:10:05,133 --> 01:10:05,967
Help!

1353
01:10:05,967 --> 01:10:07,067
- What's he yelling?

1354
01:10:07,067 --> 01:10:08,400
- I'm stuck!

1355
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,567
- Something's wrong!

1356
01:10:10,567 --> 01:10:13,933
- Come on, it's my foot, it's
 my foot, get my foot out!

1357
01:10:13,933 --> 01:10:15,633
Pull, pull-pull!

1358
01:10:15,633 --> 01:10:16,800
(straining)

1359
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,767
(dramatic orchestral music)

1360
01:10:20,767 --> 01:10:22,533
- Run!
 - [Josh] Run!

1361
01:10:22,533 --> 01:10:23,467
- They're coming!

1362
01:10:23,467 --> 01:10:27,033
(dramatic orchestral music)

1363
01:10:28,667 --> 01:10:30,700
(panting and gasping)

1364
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:33,900
(engines firing)

1365
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,033
Did you get them all?

1366
01:10:35,033 --> 01:10:36,433
- I certainly hope so!

1367
01:10:36,433 --> 01:10:37,967
(panting and gasping)

1368
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:38,900
- All right, let's go back
 to the Commander Center

1369
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,267
and figure us a trap!

1370
01:10:40,267 --> 01:10:41,100
- Come on!

1371
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:43,967
(panting and gasping)

1372
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:47,200
I've rigged a radio-control
 device inside the carrier.

1373
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,333
So, when Dreadnaught
 hears your call,

1374
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:50,600
he'll think the transmission's

1375
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,900
actually coming
 from the carrier.

1376
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:57,167
(transformer exploding)

1377
01:10:59,267 --> 01:11:00,900
- All right then.

1378
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:02,800
- Here goes everything!

1379
01:11:03,967 --> 01:11:05,500
(transmitter beeping)

1380
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,233
- This is Akira Storm with
 a class-one distress call,

1381
01:11:07,233 --> 01:11:08,633
Dreadnaught has left
 me no other recourse

1382
01:11:08,633 --> 01:11:09,833
but to flee my home world.

1383
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:12,267
I repeat, this is a
class-one distress call,

1384
01:11:12,267 --> 01:11:14,533
I'm in need of
 immediate assistance!

1385
01:11:14,533 --> 01:11:17,267
- [Dreadnaught] Don't
 worry Akira, I'll help you.

1386
01:11:17,267 --> 01:11:18,767
- [Akira] Dreadnaught, no!

1387
01:11:18,767 --> 01:11:20,467
- [Dreadnaught] Yes-s-s-s.

1388
01:11:20,467 --> 01:11:21,933
(dramatic orchestral music)

1389
01:11:21,933 --> 01:11:23,667
- He's taking the carrier
 into his tractor beam.

1390
01:11:23,667 --> 01:11:25,300
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1391
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:27,067
- He's buyin' it!

1392
01:11:27,067 --> 01:11:27,900
- It's working!

1393
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:28,700
- Closer.

1394
01:11:29,667 --> 01:11:30,500
Closer!

1395
01:11:32,367 --> 01:11:33,700
(transmitter beeping)

1396
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:36,567
That's it, the
 carrier's on board!

1397
01:11:36,567 --> 01:11:39,067
(mellow orchestral music)

1398
01:11:39,067 --> 01:11:41,800
- So, what happens now?

1399
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,933
(bomb exploding)

1400
01:11:42,933 --> 01:11:46,633
(mellow orchestral music)

1401
01:11:46,633 --> 01:11:48,733
- Well, we wait.

1402
01:11:48,733 --> 01:11:52,567
(foreboding orchestral music)

1403
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,933
(distant laser guns firing)

1404
01:12:01,933 --> 01:12:06,100
(mellow anticipatory
 orchestral music)

1405
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,800
Hey.

1406
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:17,233
What's with that?

1407
01:12:18,633 --> 01:12:19,600
- What?

1408
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:20,433
- That!

1409
01:12:22,067 --> 01:12:22,867
Nothing!

1410
01:12:25,067 --> 01:12:27,333
I don't hear anything!

1411
01:12:27,333 --> 01:12:29,867
- The attack has stopped!

1412
01:12:29,867 --> 01:12:34,067
- (laughs) You did it,
 Josh Kirby you did it!

1413
01:12:34,067 --> 01:12:34,933
(laughing)

1414
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:35,767
- Yes!

1415
01:12:35,767 --> 01:12:38,067
(laughing)

1416
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:43,233
(Dreadnaught screaming)

1417
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:46,100
- You rebel dogs!

1418
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:48,567
I'll have you splayed for this!

1419
01:12:48,567 --> 01:12:51,700
Do you hear me, Akira! (screams)

1420
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:53,067
- [Dreadnaught Soldier]
They're everywhere!

1421
01:12:53,067 --> 01:12:55,600
The worms have eaten all
our gravity stabilizers!

1422
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,767
We're gonna have to--
 - Silence, you fool!

1423
01:12:59,767 --> 01:13:01,933
We must-stand-strong!

1424
01:13:01,933 --> 01:13:05,767
(worms cooing and chattering)

1425
01:13:07,333 --> 01:13:11,500
(screams) Get this thing
off of me! (screams)

1426
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:14,433
- [Dreadnaught Soldier]
 Sir, we have no other option

1427
01:13:14,433 --> 01:13:17,433
but to surrender, we must
 abandon ship immediately!

1428
01:13:17,433 --> 01:13:20,067
- I'd rather die
 than abandon my ship!

1429
01:13:20,067 --> 01:13:22,333
(hologram buzzing)

1430
01:13:22,333 --> 01:13:23,933
I'd rather die than abandon my--

1431
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:26,700
(ship exploding)

1432
01:13:29,567 --> 01:13:31,400
- [Kang Soldier] It's gone!

1433
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:35,067
(dramatic orchestral music)

1434
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:46,667
(creature grunting and growling)

1435
01:13:46,667 --> 01:13:50,600
(dramatic orchestral music)

1436
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,067
(space suit ringing)

1437
01:13:52,067 --> 01:13:55,700
(dramatic orchestral music)

1438
01:13:58,100 --> 01:13:59,067
(space suit ringing)

1439
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:02,700
(dramatic orchestral music)

1440
01:14:07,867 --> 01:14:09,167
(space suit ringing)

1441
01:14:09,167 --> 01:14:12,833
(dramatic orchestral music)

1442
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,967
- What are you lookin' at?

1443
01:14:24,067 --> 01:14:28,100
(creature whimpering
 and growling)

1444
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,400
(cosmic whooshing)

1445
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,067
It will take far more
 than you, Josh Kirby,

1446
01:14:39,067 --> 01:14:41,633
to stop me from my destiny!

1447
01:14:41,633 --> 01:14:43,533
I am coming young Time Warrior,

1448
01:14:43,533 --> 01:14:45,067
and I'm coming to
 put things right

1449
01:14:45,067 --> 01:14:46,500
once and for all!

1450
01:14:47,367 --> 01:14:50,167
(cosmic whooshing)

1451
01:14:50,167 --> 01:14:53,833
(dramatic orchestral music)

1452
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:56,867
- Josh Kirby.

1453
01:14:58,467 --> 01:15:00,500
Thank you for your help.

1454
01:15:02,733 --> 01:15:05,233
- Well, it's the least I can do.

1455
01:15:05,233 --> 01:15:07,900
After all, it looks like
I'm gonna be living here

1456
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,500
for the rest of my life.

1457
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,900
- There's nothing Irwin can do?

1458
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:14,100
- Even for the first smartest
 guy in the 25th century,

1459
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:15,533
he still has his limits.

1460
01:15:15,533 --> 01:15:18,167
He has no way of jump-starting
 us into the Time Stream.

1461
01:15:18,167 --> 01:15:20,400
- Well, you saved
 my home planet so,

1462
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:23,200
you're a hero here as well.

1463
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:25,167
- Well, there still
 are some in this joint

1464
01:15:25,167 --> 01:15:27,567
who treat us like the plague.

1465
01:15:28,767 --> 01:15:30,800
- Akira.
(door whirring)

1466
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:31,633
- Bingo!

1467
01:15:31,633 --> 01:15:34,067
(door whirring)

1468
01:15:34,067 --> 01:15:34,900
Lover boy!

1469
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:43,133
- Arranged marriages
 on my planet

1470
01:15:43,133 --> 01:15:44,900
are a time-honored tradition,

1471
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:47,833
it has nothing to do with
 romantic affection or

1472
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:49,500
love as you know it.

1473
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:52,500
It's done out of necessity.

1474
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:55,800
- Oh, so you don't
 love this guy?

1475
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:57,467
- No, of course not.

1476
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,433
- Well, looks as if
 everything will be as it was

1477
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:03,933
in no time at all!

1478
01:16:07,567 --> 01:16:10,867
- No, everything can't
 be as it was, Akira.

1479
01:16:10,867 --> 01:16:12,100
- But I thought now

1480
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:15,900
that you're back here
 permanently you'd...

1481
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,667
Why do you look
 so glum now, hmm?

1482
01:16:17,667 --> 01:16:19,500
This is a day of victory.

1483
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:21,767
- But Josh and
 Irwin are trapped,

1484
01:16:21,767 --> 01:16:22,967
away from their home planet

1485
01:16:22,967 --> 01:16:24,667
and I am empathetic
towards their feelings.

1486
01:16:24,667 --> 01:16:26,567
- As a Warrior of Kang
 you should well know

1487
01:16:26,567 --> 01:16:28,900
that no victory is
 gained without some loss.

1488
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:30,300
Besides, you should be happy

1489
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:31,867
to be back with your own people,

1490
01:16:31,867 --> 01:16:35,133
not off gallivanting in
the company of humans.

1491
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:37,067
But according to the
 12th Code of Kang,

1492
01:16:37,067 --> 01:16:38,533
I must remain at
 Josh Kirby's side

1493
01:16:38,533 --> 01:16:41,067
until my life-debt
 is repaid to him.

1494
01:16:41,067 --> 01:16:44,467
- The 21 Codes were
 not meant for humans.

1495
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:51,533
- Has the path of Kang
 taught you nothing thus far?

1496
01:16:51,533 --> 01:16:53,700
If the 21 Codes of Kang did
 not apply to all humans,

1497
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:56,867
then they do not apply to me!

1498
01:16:56,867 --> 01:17:00,167
It is stated in the 21st
and final Code of Kang,

1499
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:01,500
"No soul can live in freedom,

1500
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:04,800
"so long as another
 remains enslaved."

1501
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:09,100
Your attitudes and actions
 against the humans are,

1502
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:13,800
are no better than
 Dreadnaught's were against us.

1503
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:14,767
- Your time spent
 with the humans

1504
01:17:14,767 --> 01:17:17,500
was bountiful indeed, Azabeth.

1505
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,967
I apologize, your
 wisdom and tolerance

1506
01:17:20,967 --> 01:17:23,933
is even greater than
your skill as a Warrior.

1507
01:17:23,933 --> 01:17:27,267
I believe you all
 have much to teach us.

1508
01:17:28,633 --> 01:17:30,933
- We all have much
 to teach each other.

1509
01:17:30,933 --> 01:17:32,400
- What up?

1510
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,300
The 12 hours are up and
it doesn't look like

1511
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:38,100
I'm gonna need my Time
 Warrior powers after all.

1512
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,267
(door exploding)

1513
01:17:39,267 --> 01:17:40,633
(groaning and shouting)

1514
01:17:40,633 --> 01:17:42,267
(Prism cooing and chattering)

1515
01:17:42,267 --> 01:17:45,933
(dramatic orchestral music)

1516
01:17:49,067 --> 01:17:51,100
- I still don't
 have your spleen,

1517
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:53,333
I've come for it now!

1518
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:57,933
(growling and yelling)
 (frenetic orchestral music)

1519
01:17:57,933 --> 01:17:59,767
Lower your weapons,

1520
01:17:59,767 --> 01:18:02,500
or I air out her
 brain the hard way!

1521
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:06,167
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1522
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:08,833
(Prism wailing)

1523
01:18:10,067 --> 01:18:11,333
Do it!

1524
01:18:11,333 --> 01:18:15,267
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1525
01:18:17,767 --> 01:18:19,167
(weapons dropping)

1526
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:22,100
(Dreadnaught laughing)

1527
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,100
Oh, my dear!

1528
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,733
Your hologram does
 not do you justice!

1529
01:18:27,733 --> 01:18:29,667
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1530
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:33,567
- (sniffs) Neither does yours.

1531
01:18:35,533 --> 01:18:38,067
- Your grievance is with me.

1532
01:18:38,067 --> 01:18:40,367
- Oh, my grievance
 is with you, huh?

1533
01:18:40,367 --> 01:18:44,200
Well, you don't give
 the orders anymore.

1534
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:47,700
You know, all's I
wanted was a few slaves.

1535
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:53,367
Why'd ya have to go and destroy
my ship, my crew, my empire?

1536
01:18:54,533 --> 01:18:56,567
- I did nothing
 but select a path,

1537
01:18:56,567 --> 01:18:59,067
the choice I had to, to
make me a better person.

1538
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:01,400
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1539
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:05,167
- Well that's why you're
gonna have to pay...

1540
01:19:06,267 --> 01:19:07,800
With her life!

1541
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:10,767
(shouting and screaming)
 (frenetic orchestral music)

1542
01:19:10,767 --> 01:19:14,933
(screaming and growling)
 (frenetic orchestral music)

1543
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,300
(screaming)

1544
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:22,233
(cosmic whooshing)

1545
01:19:23,733 --> 01:19:26,233
(baby cooing)

1546
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,400
- What happened?
 - Where's Dreadnaught?

1547
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:34,567
(baby chattering)
 (wondrous orchestral music)

1548
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:41,433
- Your new Time
 Warrior powers...

1549
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:45,100
It must work both ways!

1550
01:19:46,467 --> 01:19:47,867
- You mean this...

1551
01:19:47,867 --> 01:19:51,067
- You have just zapped
 Dreadnaught back into infancy.

1552
01:19:51,067 --> 01:19:53,100
- Aw, get outta here!

1553
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:57,267
- You hold in your hands,
 a bouncing baby Enslaver.

1554
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:03,000
- Oh come on, I'm not ready
 for fatherhood, take him!

1555
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,133
- He looks so harmless!

1556
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:06,333
(baby cooing)
 - Almost is...

1557
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:07,167
- Cute.

1558
01:20:08,367 --> 01:20:09,900
- Cute?

1559
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:11,067
Cute.

1560
01:20:11,067 --> 01:20:12,800
It's a rat fink in diapers!

1561
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,300
- Not necessarily.

1562
01:20:15,467 --> 01:20:18,233
What you see before
 you is a clean slate.

1563
01:20:18,233 --> 01:20:19,600
A soul which is now erased

1564
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,800
of all life's pains
 and pleasures.

1565
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,833
There's a choice of
 two different paths,

1566
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:28,833
the ultimate choice.

1567
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:30,367
- A chance for goodness.

1568
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:31,200
- Yes.

1569
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:34,833
A chance for goodness.

1570
01:20:34,833 --> 01:20:37,800
But we'll all have to wait to
 see where this chance leads.

1571
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:38,800
- Commander!

1572
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:41,000
I believe--

1573
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,033
- No, not in that
 order, you nitwit!

1574
01:20:43,033 --> 01:20:46,700
(dramatic orchestral music)

1575
01:20:51,067 --> 01:20:55,233
(screaming)
 (cosmic whooshing)

1576
01:20:57,833 --> 01:21:00,067
(thunder rolling)

1577
01:21:00,067 --> 01:21:03,667
(dramatic orchestral music)

1578
01:21:17,567 --> 01:21:19,067
- What's happened?

1579
01:21:19,067 --> 01:21:20,200
Where are we?

1580
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:22,167
(Prism chattering)

1581
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:25,100
- Irwin, look The
 Nullifier components!

1582
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:28,433
- Great jumping meteors,
it's a fifth component!

1583
01:21:28,433 --> 01:21:29,833
- Yeah, but how?

1584
01:21:29,833 --> 01:21:31,767
- No Josh, Josh wait a
 minute, that's no tinker toy!

1585
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:34,900
At the moment, these
 components are recharging,

1586
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:38,700
their energy at the moment
 is pure Zandarian dynamite!

1587
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,067
- Well what is it, electricity?

1588
01:21:40,067 --> 01:21:41,867
- No, not electricity.

1589
01:21:44,467 --> 01:21:46,400
But it's energy.

1590
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,633
The equivalent of
 enough jigawatts

1591
01:21:47,633 --> 01:21:49,200
to power a thousand Time Pods,

1592
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:53,133
or to zap a young man such as
 yourself into molecular dust.

1593
01:21:53,133 --> 01:21:54,200
- [Josh] Eek!

1594
01:21:56,333 --> 01:21:59,100
- Well, how much time will
 they take to recharge?

1595
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:03,800
- Well let's see, C plus
 energy, plus time expanded,

1596
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,667
at the bump-a-dump-a-dump-a-dum,

1597
01:22:05,667 --> 01:22:06,767
and carry the one--

1598
01:22:06,767 --> 01:22:08,400
- You have no idea, do you?

1599
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,733
- In a word, no.

1600
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,933
But I do know that if you
 had touched any of these,

1601
01:22:13,933 --> 01:22:18,100
you would of become
 the equivalent of a
 human lightning rod.

1602
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:22,500
- Oh, so it's kinda like the
 key on Ben Franklin's kite?

1603
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,767
- Irwin, the question is,

1604
01:22:24,767 --> 01:22:27,367
how in the Name of
 Kang did we get here?

1605
01:22:27,367 --> 01:22:30,067
- Well even though
 these five components

1606
01:22:30,067 --> 01:22:32,700
are separate at the moment,

1607
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,300
when the four of them
 were joined together,

1608
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:37,700
they were able to
 create enough power

1609
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:40,900
to transport
themselves across time,

1610
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,433
and to get in touch
 with the first

1611
01:22:43,433 --> 01:22:45,800
of the two remaining components.

1612
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,433
It also created enough power

1613
01:22:47,433 --> 01:22:50,700
to drag us through the
 vortex of the energy.

1614
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:53,233
- Well, I can see why you're

1615
01:22:53,233 --> 01:22:56,667
the second most brilliant
 man of the 25th century.

1616
01:22:56,667 --> 01:23:00,867
- Oh no, now that I defeated
 Zoetrope, I'm the first.

1617
01:23:04,367 --> 01:23:06,600
It's lonely at the top.

1618
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,567
(ground rumbling)
 (Prism chattering)

1619
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:09,800
- What is that?

1620
01:23:11,133 --> 01:23:12,200
What is that?

1621
01:23:13,567 --> 01:23:15,100
It's an earthquake!

1622
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:19,067
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1623
01:23:20,133 --> 01:23:23,067
(screaming)
 (ground rumbling)

1624
01:23:23,067 --> 01:23:27,200
(frenetic orchestral music)
 (screaming)

1625
01:23:42,133 --> 01:23:46,100
- The Nullifier
 components, they're gone!

1626
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:46,933
- Azabeth?

1627
01:23:47,833 --> 01:23:49,767
- Lopdrosters?

1628
01:23:49,767 --> 01:23:52,600
These are a delicacy
 on my planet!

1629
01:23:55,067 --> 01:23:55,900
(teeth crunching)

1630
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:57,233
- Ouch!

1631
01:23:57,233 --> 01:23:58,533
- Holy...

1632
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:01,467
- Ooh, that didn't
 tickle, you know!

1633
01:24:01,467 --> 01:24:04,067
- I'm sorry, I didn't know I...

1634
01:24:05,133 --> 01:24:06,067
- Irwin.
- Yeah.

1635
01:24:06,067 --> 01:24:07,667
- Irwin um, what's happening?

1636
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:09,667
- They're fascinating.

1637
01:24:09,667 --> 01:24:10,500
Fungi!

1638
01:24:12,067 --> 01:24:13,767
- [Josh] Yeah, yeah they look
 like they could be fun guys.

1639
01:24:13,767 --> 01:24:17,067
- No, no, no, no,
 not fun guys, fun-gi.

1640
01:24:18,167 --> 01:24:20,333
I mean, parasitic
 bacterial organisms

1641
01:24:20,333 --> 01:24:23,367
that thrive mainly on
 moisture and nitrogen.

1642
01:24:23,367 --> 01:24:26,067
- Yeah, yeah they're mushrooms.

1643
01:24:26,067 --> 01:24:28,833
I hate mushrooms, I hate 'em!

1644
01:24:28,833 --> 01:24:30,067
Except on pizza.

1645
01:24:30,067 --> 01:24:31,933
- Where I come from,
 they are much smaller,

1646
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:33,833
we call them lopdrosters and,

1647
01:24:33,833 --> 01:24:37,533
and they don't have faces,
 and they don't speak!

1648
01:24:37,533 --> 01:24:39,067
(cosmic tinkling)

1649
01:24:39,067 --> 01:24:42,067
(whimsical orchestral music)
 (Prism chattering and cooing)

1650
01:24:42,067 --> 01:24:46,733
- [Lopdroster] Oh beloved Furry
One, all great and powerful!

1651
01:24:46,733 --> 01:24:49,900
You have finally come to
 deliver us from The Muncher!

1652
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:51,333
(Prism cooing)

1653
01:24:51,333 --> 01:24:53,433
- [All Lopdrosters] We
 pledge our undying loyalty,

1654
01:24:53,433 --> 01:24:54,533
oh Furry One!

1655
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,067
- [Josh] Irwin?
- [Irwin] Yeah?

1656
01:24:57,067 --> 01:24:58,533
- Irwin, why are they
 praying to Prism?

1657
01:24:58,533 --> 01:25:01,600
- Well, apparently
 they must think

1658
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,933
Prism is some form of deity!

1659
01:25:05,067 --> 01:25:07,600
- Yeah right, a furry one!

1660
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,200
- Yes, well they're right!

1661
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,233
Well I mean, they're
 half right because

1662
01:25:12,233 --> 01:25:13,933
on the planet Prism comes from

1663
01:25:13,933 --> 01:25:16,300
for six lunar
progressions of the year

1664
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:19,167
he does, indeed,
 grow a coat of fur!

1665
01:25:19,167 --> 01:25:20,100
- Oh, cool!

1666
01:25:21,233 --> 01:25:23,133
- No-no, not, not cool,
you see the fur is--

1667
01:25:23,133 --> 01:25:24,600
- I get it Irwin, I get it!

1668
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:26,400
- [All Lopdrosters] Pledge
 our undying loyalty,

1669
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,800
oh Furry One.
 (Prism cooing)

1670
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,467
We pledge our undying
 loyalty, oh Furry One.

1671
01:25:33,667 --> 01:25:36,267
- Be careful with
 Prism, Mushroom Fuey!

1672
01:25:36,267 --> 01:25:38,133
He's one of a kind!

1673
01:25:38,133 --> 01:25:40,533
- [All Lopdrosters] We
 pledge our undying loyalty,

1674
01:25:40,533 --> 01:25:41,633
oh Furry One.

1675
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:46,233
We pledge our undying
 loyalty, oh Furry One.

1676
01:25:47,533 --> 01:25:51,067
We pledge our undying
 loyalty, oh Furry One.

1677
01:25:51,067 --> 01:25:53,067
(Prism chattering)
 - Thank you for delivering

1678
01:25:53,067 --> 01:25:56,400
the Furry One, back
 to his rightful place!

1679
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:00,567
You have proven yourselves
 to be worthy servants.

1680
01:26:00,567 --> 01:26:03,633
Hey, you can go now!
 - [Azabeth] I...

1681
01:26:04,533 --> 01:26:05,700
- Azabeth!

1682
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:07,200
- Don't worry Josh,
 she's probably

1683
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,667
just a little bit woozy from
 the air down here, that's all.

1684
01:26:09,667 --> 01:26:11,733
- I feel so weak.

1685
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:13,267
So tired, I...

1686
01:26:13,267 --> 01:26:16,700
- Irwin, Irwin that
 mushroom she ate.

1687
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:19,067
(light tinkling music)

1688
01:26:19,067 --> 01:26:21,633
- It could be that these fungi

1689
01:26:21,633 --> 01:26:25,100
aren't meant for consumption
 by carbon-based life forms.

1690
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:26,300
- You mean she's poisoned!

1691
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,067
- That could very
 well be the case, yes.

1692
01:26:28,067 --> 01:26:30,967
- It's not my fault, she
took a bite out of me!

1693
01:26:30,967 --> 01:26:32,800
(light tinkling music)

1694
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,200
This is too much!

1695
01:26:35,233 --> 01:26:36,333
- She won't die, will she?

1696
01:26:36,333 --> 01:26:38,700
I mean, she only took one bite.

1697
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:40,500
- Well, organisms have
 different tolerances

1698
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:43,067
relative to a dose of
poison, the line between

1699
01:26:43,067 --> 01:26:47,167
no effect at all and a lethal
 dose, can be very thin.

1700
01:26:48,833 --> 01:26:52,067
- It's all right,
 (inhales) I'm better now.

1701
01:26:52,067 --> 01:26:52,867
- Okay.

1702
01:26:56,067 --> 01:26:59,433
- [Narrator] On the next
chapter of Josh Kirby...

1703
01:26:59,433 --> 01:27:02,467
Time Warrior!
 (cosmic whooshing)

1704
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:03,700
- Irwin, we've gotta
 find an antidote!

1705
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:04,933
- But where, how?

1706
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:07,267
- Our king will know
 what to do, come!

1707
01:27:07,267 --> 01:27:09,833
(trumpet blaring)

1708
01:27:09,833 --> 01:27:12,167
- I summon the Royal Doctor!

1709
01:27:13,633 --> 01:27:17,367
(trumpets blaring)

1710
01:27:17,367 --> 01:27:19,867
- Very bad, only one antidote.

1711
01:27:21,233 --> 01:27:25,067
Must taste from one
 'Shroom spores, Puffball.

1712
01:27:25,067 --> 01:27:26,567
- [Josh] So, where do we
find this Puffball guy?

1713
01:27:26,567 --> 01:27:28,333
- Nightmare Hollow!
 (dramatic orchestral music)

1714
01:27:28,333 --> 01:27:32,300
No one who goes there
will ever return alive!

1715
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,467
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1716
01:27:34,467 --> 01:27:37,067
- Well, I'm obviously
 in the right place,

1717
01:27:37,067 --> 01:27:38,200
and the right time.

1718
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,433
(screaming)
(lights buzzing)

1719
01:27:39,433 --> 01:27:40,367
- Stingers!

1720
01:27:41,767 --> 01:27:44,133
These things sting like
 bees back home, only worse!

1721
01:27:44,133 --> 01:27:45,367
- Leave and make tracks!

1722
01:27:45,367 --> 01:27:47,967
(stingers buzzing)

1723
01:27:47,967 --> 01:27:51,900
On the other side of that
 bridge, is Nightmare Hollow.

1724
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,467
(mellow orchestral music)

1725
01:27:53,467 --> 01:27:55,233
- [Azabeth] The nether regions.

1726
01:27:55,233 --> 01:27:57,967
- [Lopdroster] The evil place.

1727
01:27:57,967 --> 01:28:00,733
- [Irwin] The epitomal image
 of Dante's hellish inferno.

1728
01:28:00,733 --> 01:28:02,833
- [Josh] Yeah, so in other
words, we gotta watch our butts.

1729
01:28:02,833 --> 01:28:04,867
- Josh Kirby run!

1730
01:28:04,867 --> 01:28:06,933
(rope whirling)
- Oh no!

1731
01:28:06,933 --> 01:28:09,900
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1732
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:12,333
(bridge crashing)

1733
01:28:12,333 --> 01:28:16,500
(lava bubbling)
 (suspenseful orchestral music)

1734
01:28:20,267 --> 01:28:22,967
(guttural growling)

1735
01:28:22,967 --> 01:28:25,633
(screaming)

1736
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:28,233
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1737
01:28:28,233 --> 01:28:29,667
- Don't look in his eyes!

1738
01:28:29,667 --> 01:28:33,600
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1739
01:28:38,467 --> 01:28:40,300
- [Josh] We're looking for
 a 'Shroom called Puffball,

1740
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:41,900
and we need him right now!

1741
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:45,600
- [Creature] Well, I
 will take you to them.

1742
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:47,667
- [Irwin] She's slipping
rather quickly, Josh.

1743
01:28:47,667 --> 01:28:49,533
(whimsical orchestral music)

1744
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:51,433
- Where's Puffball, where is he?

1745
01:28:51,433 --> 01:28:53,367
(whimsical orchestral music)
 (wind howling)

1746
01:28:53,367 --> 01:28:54,300
- Josh!

1747
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:56,433
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1748
01:28:56,433 --> 01:28:57,867
- Five minutes.

1749
01:28:57,867 --> 01:29:00,200
- Great jumping ions!

1750
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,533
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1751
01:29:01,533 --> 01:29:04,967
You're summoning up
 your own time storm!

1752
01:29:04,967 --> 01:29:06,367
Josh, be careful!

1753
01:29:07,467 --> 01:29:11,233
(whimsical orchestral music)

1754
01:29:32,467 --> 01:29:36,633
(moves into mellow
 orchestral music)

1755
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:47,467
(moves into dramatic
 orchestral music)

1756
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:27,767
(moves into mellow
 orchestral music)
