1
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,330
Copied G.
Six point start.

2
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,616
Three targets escaping West
on a light vessel.

3
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,798
Hey! Show me your hands!

4
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,266
Show me your hands!

5
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,268
Your hands!
Show me your hands!

6
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:16,602
Come here! Over here!

7
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,673
Watch it.

8
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:22,842
Come on, move!

9
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:24,477
Show me your fucking hands!

10
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,412
Right there. Right now.

11
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:29,715
This was the scene

12
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,784
outside a New York court
this afternoon,as Somali pirate
Mateo Wal-i-Musi

13
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,653
was brought in
for his arraignment.

14
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,454
Wal-i-Musi
was captured last April

15
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:36,756
in an aborted takeover

16
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,592
of a U.S. cargo vessel
off the coast of Yemen.

17
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:41,494
He is being brought to the U.S.
to face federal charges.

18
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,295
It's still unclear
whether the pirate

19
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,830
is old enough
to be prosecuted.

20
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,866
Investigators think
he's nineteen...

21
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,334
After a deadly fire fight,

22
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,469
U.S. Special Forces
retook the ship,

23
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,738
but not before
11 American crewmembers

24
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,740
had been tortured
and executed.

25
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,609
The surviving pirate
from the attack...

26
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,377
Tonight we also
have pictures

27
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,346
of Somali pirates like
we've never seen before.

28
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,915
Defense attorneys argue
he's just a naiïve boy

29
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,318
caught up in a criminal
enterprise against his will,

30
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,453
while prosecutors point

31
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:09,455
to the brutal death
of 11 victims

32
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:12,191
as evidence
for the maximum penalty.

33
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,194
Tonight,

34
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,595
on a special edition
of "In Focus"
we'll try to answer
the question

35
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,864
of just who
this young man is,

36
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:22,468
how it relates to the evolution
of the modern African criminal,

37
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,804
and what it means for America.

38
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,979
This is Frank Saltzman...

39
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,347
No, no, no.

40
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,216
Reporting
from the Seychelles,

41
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:38,751
this is Frank Saltzman.

42
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,352
That's what I just did.

43
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:41,654
You didn't have
enough gravitas.

44
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,489
Right. Gravitas.

45
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:45,758
Are you okay?

46
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,229
On your next vacation

47
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:52,631
to get away
from it all,

48
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,966
take heed.

49
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:56,001
Using the tips
we share with you tonight,

50
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:59,538
you can avoid
the perils of paradise.

51
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,541
Reporting from the Seychelles,
this is Frank Saltzmanz.

52
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:05,411
That's great, Frank,
just one more.

53
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,679
B roll is going.

54
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,414
- Are you good, Kane?
- Wait, wait.

55
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,582
Let's go, come on,
let's go.

56
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,283
Do you have it?
Okay.

57
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,952
That's right, just walk
straight to the camera.

58
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,553
Over the towel.

59
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:15,821
Yeah, well, I'm ready.

60
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:19,558
Okay, ready?
Three, two...

61
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,293
So, on your next vacation

62
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,696
to get away from it all,
take heed.

63
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,698
Because the tips we...

64
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,433
Oh, shit...
Frank.

65
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,968
I got it, I got it.

66
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,504
Hey, take the bottle.

67
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,906
Are you okay, Frank?

68
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:36,041
Frank, from all of us...

69
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,043
congratulations,
happy 100th show.

70
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:40,346
Congratulations, Frank.

71
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,647
Frank...

72
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,650
Come on, Frank.

73
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,652
Frank, we didn't...

74
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,454
Frank...

75
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,824
Frank, please,
it was just a joke.

76
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,459
Why would you do that?

77
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,894
- Come on, Juli.
- Stop. Would you stop filming?

78
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,529
No, wait...

79
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,997
I didn't even know
I was still recording.

80
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,699
You, Pete, turn it off.

81
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,369
I was gonna go to...

82
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,504
Before it happened, it seemed
like a really good idea.

83
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,040
You're a fucking moron,
Kane, please, don't...

84
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,342
Well...

85
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:12,344
No, we didn't do it
because we don't like Frank.

86
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:13,746
How long were you two
planning this?

87
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,614
I was just doing
what I was told.

88
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,350
No, because I know you can't buy
this brand on the island,

89
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,885
which means
you brought it with you.

90
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,620
- Is she right, Pete?
- Yeah, I know I'm right.

91
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,355
Because we left
on the 17th,

92
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,491
which means that you guys
had a six-day window

93
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,761
to realize what a stupid
fucking idea this was.

94
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,496
- Juli, come on...
- Frank is vulnerable.

95
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,632
You know America was...
waiting for that to happen.

96
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,502
Come on, Jul...

97
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,640
I hate you,
you know that?

98
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:45,878
You know what?

99
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,479
A toast...to what?

100
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,014
- This amazing sun set.
- It's beautiful.

101
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,883
Cheers!

102
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:53,352
Class dismissed.

103
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,356
Marcela, you have to watch
your hands there, sweetheart.

104
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,692
What?

105
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,428
You gotta
watch your hands there. Did you say
"watch" or "wash"?

106
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,830
Pete, get this, get this.

107
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,435
Can we forget it now?

108
00:06:09,436 --> 00:06:11,570
Come on!

109
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,439
Come on.
Let's have a good time.

110
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,575
You have to go
dance with her.

111
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,578
I'll dance with you.
Here.

112
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,822
- He's embarrassed.
- Don't be shy.

113
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:32,691
Now you know
how it feels.

114
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:34,093
- Yes, yes.
- I'm officially saying...

115
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,562
after this,
I'm going to sleep.

116
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:38,697
Good night,
good night, everybody.

117
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,965
Happy Seychelles.

118
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,468
Can I keep
this camera tonight?

119
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:43,569
Hmm?

120
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,770
What are you doing?

121
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,905
What are you doing?

122
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,673
Tired, we have
a long day...

123
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:50,843
Just relax, you know,
really really natural.

124
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:52,111
Oh, come on.

125
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,846
Did you think about
asking me first?

126
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,581
Throw it at me
at the last moment...

127
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,116
Well, I'm asking you
right now.

128
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,184
Really?
Is someone at the door?

129
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,921
Jul, you still
turn me on, babe.

130
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,057
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

131
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,659
Why didn't you
bring this up earlier?

132
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,927
You look so beautiful.

133
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,929
Oh, shut up.

134
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,530
When we're done
I'll erase it.

135
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:12,798
Be like it never happen.

136
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,934
No, see,
I don't trust that.

137
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,669
'Cause then Pete
is going to get it.

138
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,939
When we're done,
I'll erase it.

139
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,206
You're a great cameraman.

140
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:24,009
I just want you
to know.

141
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:30,182
Give me a kiss.

142
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:34,954
You know, I didn't think
it was possible

143
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,157
to make
a boring sex tape.

144
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:39,892
And I hesitate
to even call it a sex tape

145
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:42,161
because you guys
fell asleep after,

146
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,128
like what,
30 seconds of making out?

147
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,900
But guess what,
it's your lucky day,

148
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:54,039
'cause I'm going to erase it,
save you all the embarrassment.

149
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,641
Right after I show it
to Marcela.

150
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,777
What are you doing?

151
00:07:58,778 --> 00:07:58,944
Never meant
to embarrass you or...

152
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:04,950
In retrospect...

153
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,219
Relax, relax.

154
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,955
One hundred shows.
A fucking train wreck.

155
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,957
Oh, no, honestly,
you wouldn't say that.

156
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,693
My mom thinks
that is a huge deal

157
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:15,961
that I work for you,

158
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,564
like ridiculously huge.

159
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,232
Curious.

160
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,969
Is she a fan of what I do
now or before?

161
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,106
Well...it's...

162
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:27,539
All right, let's go.

163
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,844
- Say goodbye.
- Bye!

164
00:08:34,214 --> 00:08:35,714
The plane is huge.
Are you kidding me?

165
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,985
- I thought it was...
- This is our plane?

166
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,121
Hold on, wait, you guys.

167
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:44,256
We have this whole thing
to ourselves.

168
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,724
Shut up!

169
00:08:45,725 --> 00:08:48,260
Make sure we
have everything?

170
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:49,862
Yeah, we got everything.

171
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,730
Impersonate Elvis.

172
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,198
Thank you very much.

173
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,101
- Hello!
- Hi, come on.

174
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,041
Hello.

175
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,947
Oh, look at this room!
Oh, my God!

176
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,149
I'm pretty sure
in the seventies,

177
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,284
they shot porn
in this room.

178
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,585
Oh, come on, this is awesome!
Look at this place.

179
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,689
Oh, my God!

180
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,226
There's half a plane here.

181
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,694
It's really cool.

182
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,096
Look, there are wires.

183
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:24,263
Well, here we are.
Home sweet home.

184
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,567
Oh, my God!

185
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,805
President Al Sayed
flew on this plane, right?

186
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,073
Yes, baby, 35 years ago.

187
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,075
And the network gave me
a shoestring budget

188
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,211
so we are
on a 75% discount.

189
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:39,344
For 75%
of a fucking plane.

190
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,618
Frank, I'm sorry.

191
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,021
It was the best I could do
on such short notice.Spare metal here.
There are wires hanging.

192
00:09:49,022 --> 00:09:50,589
I know, I know.

193
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,157
Keep filming, Pete,
you need to practice.

194
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,725
At least I can stay awake.

195
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,027
Huh?

196
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,762
"We'll erase it, baby,
I promise."

197
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,764
What's he talking about?

198
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,299
You don't remember, do you?

199
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,167
I know it's not,
it's not your fault.

200
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:06,271
I mean, it's not that bad.

201
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,006
I mean, it's color coordinated,
we got a TV. What more do we need?

202
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:09,274
- A TV that works.
- Yeah.

203
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,809
I think it's
kind of cool.

204
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,211
It's not so bad.

205
00:10:12,212 --> 00:10:14,012
I mean, it's bad,
but it could be worse.

206
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,280
It's beautiful.

207
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,882
So get this, Pete.

208
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:18,650
We fly out of New York
on the 17th, right?

209
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:21,687
That's right

210
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:25,290
So that gives my beautiful wife
a six-day windowto realize what a stupid
fucking idea this was.

211
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,326
Touché.
You are so sweet.

212
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,995
Marcela, when you have
a minute or 30 seconds

213
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,330
I've got a video
you need to see.

214
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,198
- What is it?
- You'll love it.

215
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:34,933
Trust me.

216
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,201
Starting to pull.

217
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,203
Will this plane fly,
anybody want in?

218
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:40,806
I got 20
that says no.

219
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,074
Anybody?

220
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:44,743
I found the liquor cabinet.

221
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,945
- How about you, Frank?
- Any fucking drink will do.

222
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:52,651
- How long is our layover?
- About six hours?

223
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,686
You know, we should pop in
to see my aunt Jennifer.

224
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,688
She'd love to meet you.
She's a big fan.

225
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:59,124
She actually says to me
that you are cute.

226
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,226
Cute...

227
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:02,294
That's what they want.

228
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,963
Well, the ANC execs tell me

229
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:06,164
your best demographic
is women over 50. What the fuck?

230
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:09,401
She and her little
sewing circle

231
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,936
get together every
Thursday night to watch you. -Did you see that?
- See what?

232
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,671
There is a fucking gun
on the stewardess.

233
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,673
I don't know, just look out
the window, Kane!

234
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,808
What do you mean?

235
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,143
Shit!

236
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,378
Juliana, stay there!

237
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,079
- Kane, what?
- Stay back!

238
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,814
What's going on?
Pete, what's going on?

239
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,116
Back off!

240
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,817
- Please just stay there.
- What's going on?

241
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,352
He's got a gun
on the stewardess.

242
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,087
- Get out of the way.
- No.

243
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,956
Get on the radio,
call the tower,

244
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,090
tell them
what's happened.

245
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,825
This is not your plane!

246
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,360
We understand
but we cannot let them in.

247
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,829
Get your fucking head
away from the door!

248
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,065
Listen to me.
We cannot let them in.

249
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,367
That's my crew out there.
Get out of the way!

250
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,369
Enough!

251
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,017
Go, go!

252
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,766
Take the phones.

253
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:16,301
All of them.

254
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,036
Anything you want.

255
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,905
- Is this all of them?
- Yes. Yes, that's it.

256
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:22,441
You! Continue filming
everything.

257
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,443
Continue filming
or you will be shot.

258
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,311
Sit quietly,
follow the instructions

259
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,779
and you will not be harmed.

260
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,181
Disobey and penalties
will be harsh.

261
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,917
We will be in the air
shortly.

262
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,822
Someone is coming.

263
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,825
It's okay.
Marcela, it is okay.

264
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,830
Okay, okay.
He just wants the jewelry.

265
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,833
Whatever you want, okay?
Whatever you want.

266
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,404
Okay, okay.

267
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:02,407
Just give it to him.

268
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,065
Okay, Marcela,
he just wants...

269
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:28,934
he just wants the jewelry
and the watches.

270
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:30,068
They're just going to rob us
and they are gonna leave.

271
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,078
He wants your ring.

272
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,357
I got the ring here.

273
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,960
You want this? Take it.

274
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,962
Take it easy!

275
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:03,435
Oh, fuck,
the engine just turned on!

276
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,970
We just sit here.

277
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:06,438
What are the chances...?

278
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:09,374
All right, all right,
calm down.

279
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:11,510
He told me to film or he was
going to shoot me in the head.

280
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,912
How are we going to notify
the guards with him watching?

281
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,281
If we take off in the air,
we're going to die.

282
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,549
I fucking guarantee that.

283
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,017
Maybe you're right.

284
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:20,452
We need a phone.

285
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:22,521
- We gave them our phones.
- No, we didn't.

286
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,022
They took my international
but I have another one

287
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,124
in my bag in the front seat.
They didn't see it.

288
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,560
How the hell are we
going to get it?

289
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:31,062
Excuse me, do you
know the language

290
00:15:31,063 --> 00:15:32,497
that the hijackers
are speaking?

291
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,433
Yes.

292
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,703
But look,
if this goes wrong,

293
00:15:38,704 --> 00:15:41,439
I'll be the one
who gets shot.

294
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,444
I got an idea.

295
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,049
Marcela, now.

296
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,588
Louder.

297
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,254
The other side,
the other side!

298
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,317
Medication, medication.

299
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,492
Take one.

300
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,495
Why the hell
are they filming?

301
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,504
Did you get it?

302
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,511
Thank you.

303
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:33,618
Make the call,
just make the call.

304
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,227
English?

305
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,764
Yes, I speak English.

306
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,776
There they are.

307
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,447
Shit, I think
it worked.

308
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:04,516
Nadifa, you're brilliant.

309
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,318
It's been five minutes.

310
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:08,853
Why haven't we received
clearance?

311
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,388
- It takes time.
- Call them again.

312
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,190
Call them again.

313
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:41,786
- Do you speak English?
- Yes I do.

314
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,122
Good, then there will be
no misunderstandings.

315
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,192
Tell your guards to keep
100 meters away at all times.

316
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:49,728
We both know if you attempt
to take off you'll be shot down.

317
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,463
And if you attempt
to engage me

318
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,732
I will trigger the detonator
I have in my hand.

319
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:56,134
Do you understand?

320
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,737
Do you understand
or do you not?

321
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,805
I understand.

322
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,374
You see?

323
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,709
We're moving back
100 meters

324
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,644
as you requested.

325
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,852
Marcela...

326
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,487
it really scares me that you
can cry on command so well.

327
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,858
- What?
- What's going on?

328
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:00,799
- Why are they turning around?
- Where the hell are they going?Nadifa, what's going on?

329
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,635
- Pete, Where are they going?
- I don't know.

330
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,303
You respond well
to death threats.

331
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,375
That makes you
a rational man.

332
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:14,646
Now I have only one request.

333
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:16,915
I want to speak
to the president

334
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:18,716
of the American News
Corporation,

335
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,984
Kevin O'Connell.

336
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,986
I have Frank Saltzman
and his crew

337
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:23,455
on board this plane.

338
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,723
I want to speak
to their employer.

339
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,992
If you don't have him
on the phone in 15 minutes,

340
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:31,596
I am going to execute
a hostage.

341
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:33,665
There's no need
to speak like that.

342
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,801
We can end this
without violence.

343
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,504
That is up to you.

344
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,306
Before I can arrange
any kind of phone call,

345
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,541
I need assurance
that hostages are unharmed.

346
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:47,912
I'll be expecting the call.

347
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,918
Oh, my God, no!

348
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,386
No...

349
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,789
Marcela, stop.
Marcela, stop.

350
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:05,830
No, no, no, no, no!

351
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,304
I asked only
two things of you.

352
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:18,810
Cooperation
and all your cell phones.

353
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,348
All right, it wasn't her.

354
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,484
Sorry.

355
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,753
Hey...phone.

356
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,689
It's my mistake, I'm sorry.

357
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,958
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:37,061
- It's my mistake.
- Thank you.

359
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:37,962
No, no!

360
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:42,967
Kane, Kane, Kane!

361
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,969
Oh, fuck!

362
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,939
Kane, Kane, Kane!

363
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,973
Which hand did you dial with?

364
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:52,577
Which hand did you dial with?

365
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:57,315
Look at me!

366
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,386
Which hand did you dial with?

367
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,462
Are you getting this?
Hey, camera!

368
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,064
- Are you getting this?
- Yes I am.

369
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:15,533
Wait, what are you doing?

370
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,073
No!

371
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,542
Someone once did this to me.

372
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:26,544
You will live,
trust me.

373
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,620
No, no...

374
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:38,890
Every time you think
of disobeying me again,

375
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:41,359
remember how this feels.

376
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,760
Say you'll remember.

377
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,762
- I will.
- He didn't do anything!

378
00:22:44,763 --> 00:22:47,031
- "I will remember."
- I will!

379
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,034
What a fucking bastard.

380
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,772
Honey, let me see this.

381
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:57,976
Look, what the hell
do you want?

382
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,547
You, actually, Mr. Saltzman.

383
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,418
Do you have any more
cameras like this?

384
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,088
Yeah, I have,
I have some smaller ones.

385
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:12,423
Good. Position them
all around the cabin.

386
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:14,559
- Document everything.
- Okay.

387
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,095
I need two.

388
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,564
ow!
- Okay, okay.

389
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:23,968
Marcela...
I need you to film,

390
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:27,572
I need you to film it
for me, okay?

391
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,840
No, no.

392
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,441
I got it, I got it.

393
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:40,852
What you want?

394
00:23:40,853 --> 00:23:43,655
Come to the front cabin.

395
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:44,822
It'll be short,
it's okay.

396
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,093
Come!

397
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:50,588
We've just received
this breaking news

398
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,123
that less than an hour ago,

399
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,758
a chartered plane carrying

400
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,728
ANC destination reporter
Frank Saltzman

401
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:59,731
was apparently hijacked
off an island nation

402
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:03,267
1,500 kilometers east
of mainland Africa.

403
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:06,270
The military has successfully
blockaded the aircraft

404
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:08,139
on the ocean side tarmac,

405
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,042
where they're currently
trying to negotiate

406
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,144
with the aggressors on board.

407
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:15,279
This is Kevin O'Connell.
I represent ANC.

408
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,014
Who am I speaking to?

409
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,251
Months ago,
you ran an exposé

410
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,020
on so-called
"Somali pirates."

411
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,622
Do you know
the piece I mean?

412
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:25,890
We apologize if the...

413
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,291
I did not ask
for an apology.

414
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:31,295
I asked
if you knew the piece.

415
00:25:31,296 --> 00:25:34,766
Frank Saltzman and his crew
are only in mortal danger

416
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,267
if you allow them to be.

417
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,771
The hijackers have
only made one public demand.

418
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:42,173
That is for us, ANC,

419
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,041
to air a video of theirs

420
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,644
tonight exclusively
on this network.

421
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:47,545
Once you have, I will release
all the hostages unharmed.

422
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,783
That's all we want.

423
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:56,220
You just have to understand
this will take a bit of time.

424
00:25:57,189 --> 00:26:00,825
Hello? Hello?
Did you hear me?

425
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,964
Are you done yet?

426
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,699
You want to look good.

427
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,702
I need to do it right.

428
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,281
It's going to be okay.

429
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,283
See? The lights are back on.

430
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:40,091
There, you see?
Tell them to calm down.

431
00:27:42,928 --> 00:27:45,162
It's okay.

432
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,032
Right.

433
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:50,034
Let me.

434
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,772
Kane, what the fuck
is going on up there?

435
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:58,709
There's some kind of
interview or something.

436
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,178
Did they say anything
about taking off?

437
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,281
No, they kicked me out
before they started.

438
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,285
Guys...

439
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,191
my wireless receiver's
inside that case.

440
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,293
Hey, honey, it's me.

441
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,863
Yeah, I know
about the hijacking.

442
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,765
That's kind of why
I'm calling.

443
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,733
Well, an old friend
at ANC called me,

444
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,170
they needed someone
on the island

445
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,172
to act as a liaison
between them and the...Move. Please go straight
and move to the right.

446
00:28:28,173 --> 00:28:30,041
There's like a thousand guys
with machine guns

447
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,310
surrounding it.

448
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,444
Yeah, well,
it's a little late

449
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,713
for that 'cause
I'm already here.

450
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,114
Are you nervous?

451
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,118
An honest response
might disappoint.

452
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:50,094
Over 700 people are currently
being held hostage

453
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:53,364
by men like us.

454
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:57,969
And that number only includes

455
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:03,174
those that weren't executed
right away.

456
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:03,374
If I were you,
I would be nervous.

457
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,445
This is...

458
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,048
sound.

459
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:14,785
You can't spread messages
without words.

460
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:18,789
You'd be surprised.

461
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:22,927
Is it working?

462
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:29,000
- Maybe you should put...
- No, no, wait.

463
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:31,335
It's working.

464
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,404
No hard feelings
about before?

465
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,045
In my country, men shake
with their right hands.

466
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,551
Well, in my country,

467
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:50,154
men don't introduce
themselves with Zippos.

468
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,422
You may leave.

469
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,991
Run this way!

470
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,061
I'm going to make this
simple for you, Mr. Saltzman.

471
00:29:57,062 --> 00:30:00,531
Here is a list of questions
for you to ask me.

472
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,105
I can't accept this.

473
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:10,107
You may be able
to get this on air,

474
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,109
but it's not going to look
legitimate

475
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,246
if I throw you some
obvious softballs.

476
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:18,849
Frank says he won't read
from his list of questions.

477
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,117
Of course not.

478
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,386
Fine.

479
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:25,990
All right.
Let's start with the basics.

480
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:29,126
Why don't you tell me your name,
and spell it for me

481
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:32,163
so we can put your name on that
little graphic underneath, okay?

482
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:33,531
My name is Atlas.

483
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:37,401
That is spelled A-T-L-A-S.

484
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:40,004
It doesn't sound
like a Somali name.

485
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,272
I assume that's an alias.

486
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:43,140
Who said I was Somali?

487
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,875
You assumed?

488
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:47,144
I suppose I did.
I'm sorry if I offended you.

489
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:51,148
Why should I be offended?

490
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,884
Is it offensive in America
to be from Somalia? No, you just
don't look Somali...

491
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:55,419
Are you going to ask
a real question

492
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,620
or do I need to write
a new list, Mr. Saltzman?

493
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:00,624
Sure.

494
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,628
Why did those soldiers
suddenly back off?

495
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,468
Did you ask them nicely
if you could finish?

496
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:13,471
I mean,
I don't want to assume.

497
00:31:13,472 --> 00:31:16,340
It's amazing the effect
a bomb on a plane

498
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:19,143
will have.

499
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,611
- It was bomb.
- What?

500
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,615
I really think
he said "bomb."

501
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,084
So, why are we sitting here
with guns to our heads?

502
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:30,488
There is no gun to your head.
Don't deceive them.

503
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:32,623
Ask a real question.

504
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,492
Anyone see anything,
you know, when we were getting

505
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,494
on the plane,
a box, a package?

506
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:38,229
He had a backpack.

507
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,097
No, I moved that when I was
setting up the cameras.

508
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:41,165
I mean, it was empty.

509
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,967
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

510
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,235
There was no bomb in there.

511
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,402
Kane,
are you absolutely...?

512
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:49,006
I think they're bluffing.

513
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,341
Maybe they took it out
of the backpack before
you picked it up. This is bullshit.

514
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:51,275
There's no fucking bomb.
I'm telling you.

515
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,646
Tell me what you didn't like

516
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,984
about the network's
recent segment on pirates.

517
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,585
Everything, everything.

518
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,989
I even take exception to
the use of the word "pirate."

519
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,390
So what should
we call you then?

520
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,993
Terrorists.

521
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:11,662
You actually prefer
the term "terrorist"?

522
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:16,000
We terrorize foreigners
with guns and threats.

523
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:19,403
Terrorism implies
that there's certain...

524
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:21,539
it's for
some ideological cause,

525
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,240
<i>ot just mere profit.</i>

526
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,042
That is why it intrigues me.

527
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:28,646
The media reserves the word
"terrorist" only for Arabs.

528
00:32:28,647 --> 00:32:30,514
Why do I deserve
special treatment?

529
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:32,650
Why do you want to get
lumped in with fanatics?

530
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:34,451
Ask yourself.

531
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,386
What does the Middle East have
that Somalia does not?

532
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,525
So, what you're
telling me is

533
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,661
whenever we really want
to really scare our audience

534
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,262
we pull out
the "terrorist" card

535
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:47,998
to protect our interests
in the Middle East?

536
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:49,700
But, if one
were to waste it

537
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,536
on something like Somalia
which doesn't have any money?

538
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,139
What, the word somehow
loses its luster?

539
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,343
- That's ridiculous.
- Let's us speak off the record.

540
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:02,146
Take your microphone off.

541
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,080
Yeah, I'm with you.

542
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,616
Shit, I just lost them.

543
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:07,751
What do you mean
you lost them?

544
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:10,087
Oh, shit, you think
they figured it out?

545
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,356
I don't even,
I don't understand...

546
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,494
Soon, I am going to ask
for money

547
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,533
for my own ideological cause,

548
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:26,537
but I guarantee you
that makes no difference

549
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,505
to your terrified friends
back there.

550
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:32,509
Fear is fear.

551
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,247
Respectfully, I disagree.

552
00:33:36,248 --> 00:33:39,350
See, if all you want is money,
we can arrange for that,

553
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,718
we can make an exchange.

554
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,586
But if what you want to do

555
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,322
is convert or kill
all the infidels

556
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,591
there's no room
to bargain there.

557
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,193
So, you are saying...

558
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,728
because I'm just
a greedy negro,

559
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:52,329
your friends
aren't scared of me?

560
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,064
I didn't say that.

561
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:57,067
We're just more familiar
with your motives.

562
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,372
Are you?

563
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:03,474
Yes.

564
00:34:03,475 --> 00:34:04,642
We can put this to the test.

565
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,649
If the majority of your friends
agree with you,

566
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,784
that the motives
behind my actions

567
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,520
determine how scared
they are of me,

568
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:19,390
I will release you all
immediately.

569
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,792
- You mean that?
- But...

570
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,662
if more of them agree
with me,

571
00:34:24,663 --> 00:34:26,263
that fear is fear,

572
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:29,133
regardless of motive,

573
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:30,467
I will kill you.

574
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,738
It's not a true belief,

575
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:39,610
unless you're
willing to die for it.

576
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:42,079
Is it a problem with the
receiver or the microphone?

577
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,415
Put that away,
he's coming.

578
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,357
What?

579
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:55,125
- Go with him.
- Why?

580
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:56,794
He wants you
to go with him.

581
00:34:56,795 --> 00:34:59,663
- Fuck's sake, again, what?
- Just do what he wants, Kane.

582
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:05,536
Just so you know,
your mic's not on.

583
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:07,438
Sit.

584
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:15,579
Kane...

585
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,581
would you fear these men more

586
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:19,717
if they hijacked this plane,
in, let's say,

587
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:20,718
in the name of religion more
than just pure financial gain?

588
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,858
What's the difference?

589
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,728
You know, either way
they're psychopaths.

590
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:32,296
Yeah, Kane got it back.

591
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,298
What do they want?
What are they saying?

592
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:36,166
Hold on one second.

593
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,701
What do they have him
doing there?

594
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,703
So, this man standing here
is a psychopath?

595
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:44,174
Yeah, that's what I said.

596
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:47,177
What, does he have
some sob story

597
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,445
to justify his actions?

598
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,847
I'm sure it's very good.

599
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:53,317
Thank you. You may go.

600
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,585
What, that's it?

601
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:55,652
Well, if I'm a psychopath,

602
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,188
do you really want
to stick around?

603
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,591
Thank you, Kane.

604
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,501
1-0.

605
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,942
You really called him
a "psychopath"?

606
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,778
Seriously?

607
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,513
Oh, God.

608
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:25,516
We need to put you in front
of the camera more often, baby.

609
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:28,552
Kane, after you left,
he told Frank:

610
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:29,953
"Not a good start for you."

611
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:30,921
What does that mean?

612
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,823
"Not a good start," what?

613
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:34,758
"Not a good start for you."

614
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,560
Do you have any idea
what that means?

615
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:37,795
No, look,
he was in there.

616
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,902
What the fuck
does he want now?

617
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:46,837
He says to gather
what you can from your bags

618
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:47,905
to cover these windows.

619
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:50,841
Why?

620
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:52,443
And close the ones
with shades.

621
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:54,678
Whatever it is,
let's just...

622
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,647
Whoa, take it easy.

623
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:58,982
We're covering the windows,
just doing what you're saying.

624
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:01,985
He said
they need her up front.

625
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,929
This is Juliana.

626
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:36,620
Kane, I've got an idea.

627
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,844
Hey!

628
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:08,519
We're not scavengers.

629
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,853
Carry on.

630
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,729
Juliana...

631
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,998
does this man frighten you?

632
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:27,304
Is that a trick question?

633
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:31,475
Would he frighten you more
if he were a religious fanatic

634
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:34,478
or just a hijacker
holding us for ransom?

635
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,879
Can he see what I'm doing?

636
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,882
He doesn't have a clue,
just keep going.

637
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:39,850
I...I...I don't know.

638
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:45,589
Let me restate.

639
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:49,326
Does it make a difference?

640
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,596
I got the N and the O.

641
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:03,774
Yeah.

642
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:07,044
Yeah, I think
there is a difference.

643
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:09,079
I can rely on money
to come and save us

644
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,382
but I'm not certain
about God.

645
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,021
- You may go.
- Thank you, Jul.

646
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,623
Be safe.

647
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:21,625
Thank you.

648
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:30,500
Make sure you pull the shirts
tall so they can read it.

649
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:34,871
Marcela, they want you next.

650
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:44,014
Kane and Juliana are fine,
you'll be fine.

651
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,886
Fuck!

652
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:55,993
The skinny kid
is getting nosy.

653
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:56,860
- How are we doing?
- Almost there.

654
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,998
Frank, my turn.

655
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:06,403
- Do you want me...?
- Please.

656
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,548
What the fuck are they doing?
She's been up there too long.

657
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,817
Do you believe this?

658
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,086
- That's great.
- I know.

659
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,956
He gave it back?

660
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:28,692
What would frighten you more,

661
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:30,160
a loud bang
or a quiet noise?

662
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,738
It's going to be okay,
just answer the question.

663
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,809
I guess...

664
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,980
the bang is scarier,

665
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:50,614
but a quiet noise
is creepier.

666
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,689
So a poised person
whispering in your ear

667
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,856
can be just as terrifying
as a lunatic howling?

668
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,528
- In different ways.
- Listen...

669
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:09,466
Would it frighten you more
if I were a raving madman

670
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:12,002
threatening to blow up
this plane in the name of God,

671
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:14,538
or if I calmly had a gun
pointing to your head

672
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:18,875
while waiting to collect
my money?

673
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:21,878
Just answer the question.

674
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,752
I guess it doesn't matter.

675
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,089
I wouldn't want to be
in either situation.

676
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:42,032
That is understandable.

677
00:41:42,033 --> 00:41:44,901
Thank you, Marcela,
that is all.

678
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,040
ANC wants a live report.

679
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:52,175
I'm not a reporter;
I wouldn't know what to say.

680
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,511
You'll say what you see,
it's very easy.

681
00:41:55,847 --> 00:41:57,848
What is that?

682
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:02,185
Something in the window.

683
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,187
Hold on.

684
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:11,995
"No bomb."

685
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,864
What's going on up there?
If she's not back in a minute...

686
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:20,303
He asked for you to come.
Frank asked you to come.

687
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,772
Pete...

688
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:23,707
Give it to me,
I'll take it.

689
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:26,676
Pete, there's something
about the question.

690
00:42:26,677 --> 00:42:27,711
You do realize
the consequences

691
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,116
if this boy
doesn't agree with you?

692
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:36,253
It's your rules.

693
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:38,722
It's your opinion.

694
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:43,994
Pete, sit down.

695
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:59,609
What kind of questions
did he ask you?

696
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:00,811
He asked me something
about a loud noise.

697
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,283
Something about God.

698
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:07,884
Did he ask you
anything about God?

699
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:08,051
Something about what makes
you more fearful.

700
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,657
God or money.

701
00:43:13,658 --> 00:43:15,992
- Money, yes.
- God or money.

702
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:17,928
I think they're both
pretty terrifying.

703
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,868
Take your time.

704
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:39,049
I don't care
why you're doing this.

705
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,318
So whether I'm doing this
for religion or money,

706
00:43:41,319 --> 00:43:44,788
it does not influence
how much you fear me.

707
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,828
No...

708
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:54,831
It is the same end result.

709
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,905
Frank...

710
00:44:01,906 --> 00:44:04,174
are you okay?

711
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:05,909
Frank, what is going on?

712
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,912
Just tell me.

713
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:09,312
Just tell...

714
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:28,665
Fear is fear, Frank.

715
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:33,703
All right, okay.

716
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,705
Jesus!

717
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,846
Well, I lost.

718
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,314
So you're going
to kill me then.

719
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:47,851
Just like that.
No more interview.

720
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,452
If that is
your only question,

721
00:44:49,453 --> 00:44:49,786
then you have missed
the point entirely.

722
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:54,057
Is anything happening?

723
00:44:55,927 --> 00:44:58,795
Juliana, does anything
seem to be happening?

724
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:01,798
No, but the side of the plane
looks like Wheel of Fortune.

725
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:05,335
Shit, maybe we should have
spelled it in French.

726
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:08,071
Frank is still up there.

727
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,806
Is the military
doing anything?

728
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:11,074
Nothing.

729
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:12,008
- Are you sure?
- There's nothing!

730
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:16,212
We're ready to go.

731
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:20,216
Yeah, he's in here.

732
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,251
I'll put him on.

733
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:44,074
Okay...

734
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:46,276
Say bye.

735
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,085
Your name, Atlas, that's got
to stand for something,

736
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,486
you know,
I was thinking...

737
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,989
it kind of reminds me
of...

738
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,390
Please...

739
00:46:00,391 --> 00:46:02,125
Please don't.

740
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:03,960
You see...

741
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:07,831
the omission
of the word "terrorist"

742
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:09,499
is not the only thing
I disapproved of

743
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,968
in that network piece.

744
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:16,506
I also hated its arrogance.

745
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:19,376
They pretended to understand
that boy who was captured.

746
00:46:19,377 --> 00:46:21,511
Listing his choices,
talking about his family

747
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:22,979
like they knew him.

748
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,247
They don't know him.

749
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:25,115
I get it, I get it.

750
00:46:25,116 --> 00:46:27,117
No, no, no,
you don't.

751
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,351
I hated the piece too.

752
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,053
So what,
you would have fixed it?

753
00:46:30,054 --> 00:46:31,921
I know more about your plight
than you think I do.

754
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,189
- Oh, do you?
- Yes.

755
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:37,794
I've been to Somalia
many times.

756
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:39,129
I've actually been reading up

757
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:42,265
on that kid on trial,
Mateo Wal-i-Musi.

758
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:44,067
The one that you're
always talking about,

759
00:46:44,068 --> 00:46:45,902
you know, the angle
that I would have used...

760
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:47,504
Stand up, Frank.

761
00:46:47,505 --> 00:46:49,973
- The angle I...
- Stand up, Frank!

762
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:53,510
Did you hear that?
What that fuck?

763
00:46:53,511 --> 00:46:54,978
It's the pilot.

764
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:57,213
They're doing something
to the pilot.

765
00:46:57,214 --> 00:46:58,248
Kneel down.

766
00:47:06,524 --> 00:47:08,591
Pretend with me, Frank,
that you are a young Somali.

767
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,597
Say it.

768
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:15,899
Say what?

769
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,034
"I am a young Somali."

770
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:22,038
I am a young Somali.

771
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:24,908
According to your network,
you are doomed to die

772
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:28,311
because you lost a game
of chance called privilege.

773
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:31,314
But,
just at the last moment,

774
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:34,050
someone gives you
another chance.

775
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,920
They tell you
that if you take the knife,

776
00:47:36,921 --> 00:47:38,321
you will be spared.

777
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:39,456
Take the knife, Frank.

778
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:44,194
Take the knife, Frank!

779
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,929
Now, of course,

780
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:49,599
just taking the knife
is not enough.

781
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,201
- You have to use it.
- No.

782
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,470
I want you to stab
this man right here.

783
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:55,205
- As hard as you can.
- No!

784
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:57,540
And then,
your debt to me is paid.

785
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,175
Stab this man, Frank,

786
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:02,278
or my friend here
will shoot you in the head.

787
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:03,947
You begged me
for a way out, Frank.

788
00:48:03,948 --> 00:48:06,282
You begged me for a way out,
I am giving you one.

789
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,284
I cannot!

790
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:12,889
You can and you will.

791
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,159
Stab him right here,
as hard as you can

792
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,027
and then your debt to me
is paid.

793
00:48:18,028 --> 00:48:20,163
No, I can't.

794
00:48:20,164 --> 00:48:24,167
Do it and live,
or don't and die.

795
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:26,436
Goodbye, Frank.

796
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,375
Frank!

797
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,378
Frank, you okay?

798
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,113
Well joining us
on the telephone now

799
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:41,651
is regional correspondent
Ian Finley

800
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:44,387
live from Victoria
International Airport

801
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:45,655
in the Seychelles.

802
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:47,123
Ian, what can you tell us

803
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:50,126
about the situation
at this time?

804
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:03,706
Okay, listen,
hold the wound.

805
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,108
Hold the wound.

806
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:09,312
Hold it, hold it.

807
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:16,186
Why did you do this?
Huh?

808
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:17,487
Why did you do this?

809
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:17,720
Ian, can you tell us anything

810
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,125
about the condition
of Frank Saltzman at this time?

811
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:24,160
All I can tell you
is that the authorities

812
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,562
are doing everything
in their power

813
00:49:25,563 --> 00:49:28,565
to keep this plane
on the ground.

814
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:31,434
Don't you wish you had
more than two choices?

815
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:39,108
But you didn't, Frank.
You didn't.

816
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:52,322
Fuck you.

817
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:57,193
I don't know
if I'm stopping the bleeding.

818
00:49:59,063 --> 00:50:01,064
I don't know
what the fuck I'm doing.

819
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,709
So, Ian,
you talk about movement.

820
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:16,446
Can you describe what sort
of movement you're seeing?

821
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,318
Ian?
Ian, can you hear me?

822
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:26,689
This is different.

823
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,224
They had been keeping
their distance

824
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:30,326
but now the teams
are moving.

825
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,072
Jesus Christ.

826
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:47,043
Ian?

827
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:50,713
I said do not engage me.

828
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:54,450
I said a boundary
of 100 meters,

829
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:57,453
you agreed
to these conditions.

830
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,055
We haven't been able
to reach...

831
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,723
Don't patronize me.
You broke your word.

832
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,726
The consequences
are on you alone.

833
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,197
Where are you?

834
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:09,532
What these guys are doing,
they're moving,

835
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:10,700
they're staying
right beside the...

836
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:12,602
Ian?

837
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:17,206
Explosion!

838
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:19,342
Oh, fuck!

839
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:21,544
Just because you're not
on the tarmac with us

840
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:24,147
does not make you safe.

841
00:51:24,148 --> 00:51:25,548
Are you okay?

842
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:28,084
Yeah, I'm fine.

843
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:31,087
Where the hell
did those come from?

844
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:52,642
How is he doing?

845
00:51:57,648 --> 00:51:59,315
What did he say?

846
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:01,317
It's a profanity.

847
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:04,587
It doesn't quite
translate in English.

848
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:07,857
He's still talking.
It's good I suppose.

849
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:09,859
- If we take off...
- No, Marcela, we have to...

850
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:14,163
If we take off they'll kill us
and if we stay they'll kill us.

851
00:52:23,407 --> 00:52:26,142
Can I at least
bring him some water?

852
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:28,144
I stabbed him,
for Christ's sake.

853
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,279
Can I just talk to him?

854
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,282
You didn't kill him.

855
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:34,417
I had you stab him

856
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:36,152
in a place
that bleeds heavily

857
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:41,157
but is completely non-fatal
if treated

858
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:44,560
which is what your friends
are doing back there right now.

859
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:47,296
All blood and no bite.

860
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:49,298
Fireworks.

861
00:52:49,299 --> 00:52:51,434
You had me stab a man
so you could prove a point?

862
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:57,540
I needed
to get your attention.

863
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,480
That is the difference
between talking about something

864
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:06,749
and feeling it.

865
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,484
You think
this proves something

866
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:11,754
about me or about you?

867
00:53:13,757 --> 00:53:15,425
I don't know
what you're saying.

868
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:19,762
Yeah, yeah.
Just talking, all right?

869
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:21,264
He's a little lucid.

870
00:53:21,265 --> 00:53:23,232
He's a little lucid,
can he talk?

871
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:24,767
Yes.

872
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:26,903
Well, he knows this plane
inside out, don't he?

873
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:27,770
Yes.

874
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:28,805
So, can he tell us a way

875
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:30,540
of keeping it on the ground?

876
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:33,409
A way of disabling it?

877
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:39,716
What if they blow up
the fucking plane?

878
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:44,654
So I take it,
pirates play favorites.

879
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:52,595
What do you mean?

880
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:55,598
You treat that little skinny one
different from those two.

881
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,635
Who is he to you?

882
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,971
Why do you bring up the boy?

883
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:03,573
Precisely that,

884
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,842
like the one in New York,
he's just a boy.

885
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:08,845
His gun is older than he is.

886
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:15,451
He is like...
a photo in a dark room.

887
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:16,352
Slowly developing.

888
00:54:18,522 --> 00:54:20,590
What is your cause?

889
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:24,727
Please,
enlighten our audience.

890
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:27,730
What do you want?

891
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,601
You see?

892
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:35,004
It has taken you this long
to admit that.

893
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:36,606
That you don't know me.

894
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:39,008
That you don't have
all the answers.

895
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:41,577
Maybe that is the lesson
you take back to your network

896
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,045
instead of them guessing
all the time.

897
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:44,647
You know?
I'm sick of hearing this.

898
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:46,649
That the media is shallow,
the media is lazy,

899
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,451
and that we are responsible
for everything.

900
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,319
That's lazy in itself.

901
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,588
I mean, the person who is
oversimplifying everything

902
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:54,724
at this table is you.

903
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:58,594
You're oversimplifying
and avoiding.

904
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:00,029
That boy...

905
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,498
every time they yell at him
or hit him,

906
00:55:02,499 --> 00:55:03,699
I see you recoil.

907
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,768
And you try to hide it,
but you can't.

908
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,529
He says it is possible

909
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,398
to disengage
the fuel line below.

910
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:38,401
Okay, below,
where, where?

911
00:55:38,402 --> 00:55:39,936
There's an exposed hatch

912
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:42,104
down to the cargo deck
right there.

913
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:43,806
Oh, you gotta be
fucking kidding.

914
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:45,942
Kane, you're not going
to do this.

915
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:47,743
Okay, can he talk us
through the steps?

916
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,078
Come on, Kane.

917
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,414
Please, Pete...sometimes
we put the camera down.

918
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:52,748
Remember that.

919
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,717
Juliana, seriously?
You can't let...

920
00:55:54,718 --> 00:55:56,052
They are too complex.

921
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:58,087
You can't possibly
remember them all.

922
00:55:58,088 --> 00:56:00,523
Besides it's dark in there,
you can't see anything.

923
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,508
Atlas...

924
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,517
I'll let him know.

925
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:29,518
We gotta get him
out of here.

926
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:40,789
Tell him whatever you need
to tell him.

927
00:56:46,637 --> 00:56:48,404
Okay, listen.
I got another camera.

928
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,739
I'm going to stick
a wireless mic on it.

929
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,941
You'll take it down with you.

930
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:54,410
How you doing?

931
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,545
We'll have the receiver
up here.

932
00:56:56,546 --> 00:57:01,584
Walkie talkies...

933
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:02,952
Kane, the battery
is running low. If you're going to go,
you got to go now! I got it.

934
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:06,856
Go.

935
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:08,157
Nadifa says she can hold it
for two minutes.

936
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:09,859
If I say come back,
come right the hell back, okay?

937
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,861
- Okay. See you in a bit.
- Shit.

938
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:22,705
If you won't answer
any questions about yourself,

939
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:26,842
may I ask you a selfish one?

940
00:57:26,843 --> 00:57:28,711
That depends.

941
00:57:28,712 --> 00:57:32,114
Listen,
I'm not who I used to be.

942
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:34,583
You can call it fame
or whatever you want.

943
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:36,852
But I'm not that guy
anymore.

944
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:40,723
Just, why me?

945
00:57:40,724 --> 00:57:43,459
A-list newscasters
don't visit East Africa

946
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,595
as much as they used to.

947
00:57:46,596 --> 00:57:49,598
I'm afraid you were chosen
by default.

948
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:52,101
But if it's any consolation,

949
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:55,571
I'll probably put you back
in prime time tonight.

950
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:59,642
You know?

951
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:06,048
I know about your deadline
and all of that, but listen,

952
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:07,216
why don't you just
let the others go,

953
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,651
I can stay behind.

954
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,786
You probably made
the network's day

955
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:12,054
with all this...

956
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:13,823
Here.

957
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:16,258
It was getting a lot
of interference earlier.

958
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:20,129
If it still does,
try channel 2.

959
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,865
Okay, Nadifa,
here's what I want you to do.

960
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:24,967
I want you to put
those in your ears.

961
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:27,236
Okay.

962
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:30,072
Okay...

963
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:31,974
I need the earphones...
the earphones...

964
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:41,250
Okay, Nadifa,
can you hear me?

965
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,252
Where are you now?

966
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:49,592
Do you see the panels yet?

967
00:58:49,593 --> 00:58:52,995
Red panels, all the way
to the front of the plane.

968
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:55,598
- Yeah, I got a hole.
- You're in the right place.

969
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:56,999
Okay, through that?

970
00:58:58,602 --> 00:59:02,805
Yeah, I see it.
Hold on.

971
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:05,941
There should be
some red panels to your left.

972
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:08,944
Let me know
when you see them.

973
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:12,681
Yeah, a panel.
I've got that.

974
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:16,085
Let me know
when you see them.

975
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:24,226
He knows Kane is gone.

976
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,231
Nadifa, say he's in the bathroom
to calm him down.

977
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:34,236
Everybody quiet.
Quiet.

978
00:59:34,237 --> 00:59:35,871
Listen, everyone, calm down.
Calm down, Nadifa!

979
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:41,777
He's in the bathroom,
he's in the bathroom!

980
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:42,311
Oh, my God,
oh, my God!

981
00:59:44,848 --> 00:59:46,315
Okay.

982
00:59:51,321 --> 00:59:54,323
Tell him to come now.

983
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,202
Nadifa, are you there?

984
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:08,204
Pete?

985
01:00:08,205 --> 01:00:09,672
He's too far away.

986
01:00:09,673 --> 01:00:12,341
Tell him to come now.

987
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:14,944
- Do you hear me?
- He's in the bathroom.

988
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:18,614
He's just in the bathroom,
calm down.

989
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:22,151
He's calling the others.
He's coming.

990
01:00:22,152 --> 01:00:25,154
He's coming!

991
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:28,290
Everybody calm down.
Just calm down!

992
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:35,030
Right fucking now,
get him up here.

993
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:37,766
Kane, Kane...

994
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,301
You gotta get the fuck out
of there now.

995
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:42,171
You gotta get the fuck out
of there now, Kane.

996
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:50,045
Damn it, Kane!
Do you hear me?

997
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,152
Shit.

998
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:57,820
Okay.

999
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:59,155
If you can hear me,

1000
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:02,224
I'm just going to be
pressing buttons, yeah.

1001
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:07,423
You fuck!
You fuck!

1002
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:09,291
Juliana, don't!

1003
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:11,860
Everybody calm down.

1004
01:02:11,861 --> 01:02:12,261
Juliana, calm down...
Calm!

1005
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:18,367
Juliana!

1006
01:02:18,368 --> 01:02:20,736
Did you see that?

1007
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:25,140
What?

1008
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:28,244
I don't know.
Flash of light.

1009
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,359
You don't think...?

1010
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,861
I don't know.

1011
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:47,363
But the deadline's not up.

1012
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:49,131
They haven't even passed off
the footage yet,

1013
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:50,299
why would they just...

1014
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,269
I don't know.

1015
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:22,391
Nadifa, ask him
if I can use the bathroom.

1016
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:23,318
I don't know
what you think you saw,

1017
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:26,655
but everything is fine.

1018
01:05:26,656 --> 01:05:29,057
We're conducting
the interview.

1019
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:31,226
Our spotters
saw a flash of light,

1020
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:34,530
we need to be sure
it was not a gunshot.

1021
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:37,266
You have my word.

1022
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:41,403
Your word is not good enough
at this point.

1023
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:46,008
Is the network liaison
still there?

1024
01:05:46,009 --> 01:05:49,278
Have him come aboard
with a camera;

1025
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,379
he will validate everything
I've just said.

1026
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:54,650
Hello, do you hear me?

1027
01:05:57,253 --> 01:06:00,055
We can work with that.

1028
01:06:00,056 --> 01:06:02,458
For this transaction,

1029
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:03,525
it will cost you
5 million dollars.

1030
01:06:06,663 --> 01:06:08,330
The liaison first,
then we talk money.

1031
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:12,734
One condition.

1032
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:15,471
The footage
can leave for free

1033
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:18,207
if the liaison stays
until I get the money.

1034
01:06:18,208 --> 01:06:21,743
Give us 15 minutes
to secure ourselves.

1035
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:24,546
Ten.

1036
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,482
- How is he doing?
- He's okay.

1037
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,086
He says you were not
strong enough to kill him.

1038
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:37,092
I need your attention please.

1039
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:38,093
The authorities believe
violence has occurred.

1040
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:45,067
They will not clear us
for takeoff

1041
01:06:45,068 --> 01:06:46,735
unless we allow someone
to board the plane

1042
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:49,438
and prove otherwise.

1043
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:50,038
We need to clean up...

1044
01:06:54,043 --> 01:06:56,578
this...

1045
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:59,314
Clean yourselves.

1046
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:02,518
We need to clean up
and cover up.

1047
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:06,255
Can you pick him up?

1048
01:07:06,256 --> 01:07:08,056
Sit him down here.

1049
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:11,460
He needs to go
on this chair.

1050
01:07:11,461 --> 01:07:11,727
Frank, could you come
with me, please?

1051
01:07:15,732 --> 01:07:17,466
Frank?

1052
01:07:17,467 --> 01:07:20,068
We have nothing more
to talk about.

1053
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:22,070
I haven't said everything
I needed to.

1054
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:26,208
Come.

1055
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,743
Well I have.
Fuck off! I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you.

1056
01:07:27,744 --> 01:07:30,812
Frank, come!

1057
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:37,653
The liaison is ready,
but before we send him in,

1058
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:39,221
you need
to uncover the windows.

1059
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:42,090
We're making progress
on the money.

1060
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:45,627
There's a small addendum
to the money request,

1061
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:47,496
I want it given in full

1062
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:51,433
to the Kips Bay
Children's Outreach Fund.

1063
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,101
That's K-I-P-S Bay
Children's Outreach Fund.

1064
01:07:57,640 --> 01:08:00,809
This will be
our last communication

1065
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:03,412
until I get
takeoff clearance.

1066
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:04,479
Well, we're just now getting

1067
01:08:06,149 --> 01:08:09,151
our first live look
at the situation,

1068
01:08:09,152 --> 01:08:10,385
but we have just received word
that our own Ian Finley

1069
01:08:15,158 --> 01:08:17,693
will in fact be allowed
on to the plane

1070
01:08:17,694 --> 01:08:21,296
to confirm the condition
of the hostages through video.

1071
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:28,270
Kips Bay?

1072
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:31,807
Children's Outreach Fund?

1073
01:08:31,808 --> 01:08:33,408
Bullshit!

1074
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:34,610
You have very good hearing.

1075
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:37,546
Listen,
stop fucking with me, okay?

1076
01:08:37,547 --> 01:08:40,282
Two of my friends are dead
and I want answers.

1077
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:42,284
You owe me answers.

1078
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:52,561
Mr. O'Connell...

1079
01:08:52,562 --> 01:08:55,597
You don't negotiate for us. We can't pay 5 million dollars
live on our own network.

1080
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:56,865
Sir, you won't have to.

1081
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:58,867
The liaison
is just to get us in.

1082
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:00,869
Finley's not even
an ANC employee.

1083
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,805
He's just there
as a personal favor for us.

1084
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:06,208
There are only two plays here,
Mr. O'Connell.

1085
01:09:06,209 --> 01:09:08,377
You pay the money
or we send in your man.

1086
01:09:08,378 --> 01:09:09,177
Your choice.

1087
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,649
You just make sure
he is safe.

1088
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:25,360
This fund.
It's a front, isn't it?

1089
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:27,763
A front for what?

1090
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:31,767
It's for
a very powerful attorney.

1091
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:33,769
What the hell
do you need a lawyer for?

1092
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,370
Frank, I need you to know

1093
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:37,339
that your friends dying
was not planned.

1094
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:40,409
Fuck you!
Don't call me Frank!

1095
01:09:44,614 --> 01:09:47,482
Kips Bay,
that's in New York.

1096
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:49,885
The kid
in the network story.

1097
01:09:49,886 --> 01:09:52,621
That's what the expensive
lawyer is for, isn't it?

1098
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:56,491
Is that
what this is all about?

1099
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:57,459
America does not negotiate
with terrorists or pirates.

1100
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:06,234
I couldn't take someone hostage
and demand his release.

1101
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:09,438
I need to have him
acquitted by law.

1102
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:14,209
What do you care?

1103
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,510
It's just like the kid
in the back.When I asked you earlier

1104
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,779
why you were so protective
of that kid,

1105
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:20,515
I thought to myself secretly,

1106
01:10:20,516 --> 01:10:23,785
he must be his little brother
or something?

1107
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:27,255
The kid back there isn't
your little brother...

1108
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:28,790
Mateo Wal-i-Musi is, right?

1109
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:33,662
You wanted an interview,
you got an interview!

1110
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:38,266
Answer
the fucking question!

1111
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:40,936
Yes.

1112
01:10:40,937 --> 01:10:45,407
My brother Mateo is on trial
in New York City,

1113
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:47,676
but in the jury's mind
he is already guilty

1114
01:10:47,677 --> 01:10:49,411
because your network's piece

1115
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:52,347
made him the poster boy
for piracy in America.

1116
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:53,882
So this is revenge
against the network?

1117
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:55,350
No, it's not
about revenge;

1118
01:10:55,351 --> 01:10:56,752
it's about re-education.

1119
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:58,420
Your network wanted
to investigate

1120
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,655
how a boy could be involved
in such atrocities?

1121
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:03,658
Well, I have shown you here,
firsthand.

1122
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:06,261
Let me get this straight.

1123
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:09,931
So, you're not really
a pirate, are you?

1124
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:10,398
No.

1125
01:11:12,635 --> 01:11:14,536
I left Somalia

1126
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:20,942
when Mateo
was still a baby.

1127
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:24,713
Off to better myself.

1128
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:26,314
By the time I got back

1129
01:11:26,315 --> 01:11:29,417
he was already taking orders
from those two.

1130
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:31,553
There was nothing I could do.

1131
01:11:31,554 --> 01:11:33,421
When he was captured
on that ship,

1132
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:38,293
they fled and set him up
to take the blame.

1133
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,962
So, this whole thing
is a trap for them.

1134
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,831
Something like that.

1135
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:44,666
And they don't know
who you are!

1136
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,935
Oh, they will.

1137
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:49,938
They will.

1138
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:52,941
Why film everything?

1139
01:11:52,942 --> 01:11:55,076
When America sees
that skinny boy in the back,

1140
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:58,346
they will see my brother too.

1141
01:11:58,347 --> 01:12:02,083
The abuse he endured.

1142
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:04,019
How they cornered
a helpless child

1143
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:06,521
and make him do
unspeakable things

1144
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:08,523
for their own gain.

1145
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:10,058
In other words...

1146
01:12:10,059 --> 01:12:12,527
exactly what you've done
to this kid!

1147
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:14,830
I don't understand,
you blame these two

1148
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:17,933
for having made your brother,
but who made them?

1149
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:20,802
I mean, aren't they somebody's
fucked up little brothers, too?

1150
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:23,738
Where does it end?

1151
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,674
That kid killed
one of my colleagues.

1152
01:12:29,812 --> 01:12:30,812
If he is supposed to be
the mirror image of Mateo,

1153
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:38,687
what does it do
for your brother?

1154
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:41,823
How does it
make him look?

1155
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:44,693
Makes him look
like a killer.

1156
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,628
- Do not deviate.
- Finley, you're crazy, man!

1157
01:12:46,629 --> 01:12:48,530
Can I ask any questions?

1158
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:54,102
Only if you allow them,
okay?

1159
01:12:54,103 --> 01:12:57,806
So what are the assurances
that he'll let us leave?

1160
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:04,512
Ian Finley and his cameraman

1161
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:08,683
obviously approaching
with great caution.

1162
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:11,987
I just realized

1163
01:13:11,988 --> 01:13:12,754
I forgot to get my sister
a souvenir. We'll pick one up in Nairobi.

1164
01:13:15,091 --> 01:13:17,592
And so what if America
sees this footage

1165
01:13:19,695 --> 01:13:21,563
and they decide
that that kid back there,

1166
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:22,964
and therefore
your brother,

1167
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:25,967
is to be held responsible,

1168
01:13:25,968 --> 01:13:28,703
because they
were taken advantage of,

1169
01:13:28,704 --> 01:13:30,705
and that's not right,

1170
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:31,706
but ultimately,
they made the choice.

1171
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:39,447
Really?

1172
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:40,982
In which case,

1173
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:45,120
I would like you to share
with America right now,

1174
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:45,787
why you made the choice
to stab that pilot.

1175
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:54,529
Diagnose your motivations
for the camera, please.

1176
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:10,078
What's stopping me
from telling your friends

1177
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:10,478
you're going to hang
them all out to dry?

1178
01:14:14,684 --> 01:14:16,217
Even if you could,

1179
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:19,754
it would be
mutually assured destruction.

1180
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:27,829
I'm just curious...

1181
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:30,832
if you're not a pirate
by occupation,

1182
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:32,167
what are you;
I mean, before today?

1183
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:56,925
Well...

1184
01:14:56,926 --> 01:15:00,061
I am a schoolteacher.

1185
01:15:11,273 --> 01:15:13,675
Frank...go to the back

1186
01:15:18,214 --> 01:15:20,081
and be smart.

1187
01:15:45,775 --> 01:15:48,910
And as you can see
on your screen now,

1188
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:53,882
they've just opened the door,
that's the first time

1189
01:15:53,883 --> 01:15:56,885
since the plane
was taken hours ago.

1190
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:05,660
Come.

1191
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,065
Is he a cop?
I don't know!

1192
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:15,070
Should we say something
to him?

1193
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,738
I mean,
we gotta let him know...

1194
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:20,642
No.
Let's see what happens.

1195
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:43,898
I was told that there were
more than three hostages.

1196
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,667
You mean more than three
white hostages?

1197
01:16:45,668 --> 01:16:47,168
No, I meant passengers.

1198
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:49,170
What about the African crew?
Are they not hostages?

1199
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:52,140
Yes, of course they are,
but that's not what I meant.

1200
01:16:52,141 --> 01:16:56,044
Just...

1201
01:16:56,045 --> 01:16:57,912
Can I just speak
to one of them please? You have two minutes.

1202
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:02,350
Please.

1203
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:06,187
Sir, are you the captain?

1204
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:07,789
I am.

1205
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:11,192
How many passengers
boarded the plane?

1206
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:14,295
However many you see here.

1207
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,197
How about asking one
of the non-African hostages,

1208
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:20,869
since you like
to make the distinction.

1209
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:23,671
No, actually...
I think we're okay.

1210
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:24,939
I'm just going to...

1211
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,341
if I may...
continue...

1212
01:17:26,342 --> 01:17:29,644
Make it quick.

1213
01:17:41,957 --> 01:17:43,791
Why are you allowing them
to film,

1214
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:45,059
if you don't mind my asking?

1215
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:48,830
It's none of your business.

1216
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:51,833
You have one more minute.

1217
01:18:01,911 --> 01:18:04,045
Just to reiterate
if you've just tuned in,

1218
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:08,316
we do not have a feed
inside the plane at this time.

1219
01:18:08,317 --> 01:18:12,053
We're going to have to wait
for Ian and his cameraman.

1220
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:12,854
It's been about
three minutes so far.

1221
01:18:30,873 --> 01:18:33,875
As you can see,
everything is fine.

1222
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:42,283
Okay, Finley, let's go.

1223
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:43,751
Let's go.

1224
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:45,887
Go, go.

1225
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:48,289
Oh, my God,
there's blood on his shirt.

1226
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:50,158
- Fuck!
- Wait, wait, wait!

1227
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:53,161
Fuck!

1228
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,938
It's been roughly
ten minutes

1229
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:07,809
since Finley
was brought on board.

1230
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:11,479
It was thought that
he would've returned by now.

1231
01:19:28,831 --> 01:19:30,832
Where did the blood
come from?

1232
01:19:30,833 --> 01:19:32,267
On my shirt,
where did it come from?

1233
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:33,801
They killed two
of our friends already.

1234
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:36,504
Nadifa, what are they
arguing about?

1235
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:38,306
Whether or not to kill us.

1236
01:19:38,307 --> 01:19:41,309
At least they're
arguing about it.

1237
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,781
This isn't what you think.

1238
01:19:49,918 --> 01:19:50,818
He's not even a pirate.

1239
01:19:52,988 --> 01:19:55,189
He's using this whole thing

1240
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:00,795
as a setup
for the other two. What does that mean?

1241
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:05,066
It's revenge

1242
01:20:05,067 --> 01:20:07,935
for what they did
to his brother. What do you mean,
his brother?

1243
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:09,170
What do you mean?

1244
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:10,571
Who is his brother?

1245
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:12,307
- You know English.
- Oh, fuck.

1246
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:15,043
Say it again,
who is his brother?

1247
01:20:15,044 --> 01:20:15,376
- Sir, there was something else.
- Who is his brother?

1248
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:20,548
What do you mean?

1249
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:21,983
You misunderstood!

1250
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:25,053
Who is his brother?

1251
01:20:25,054 --> 01:20:28,056
You misunderstood!

1252
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:35,196
Who is his brother?

1253
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:36,998
Frank, if you know
his name tell him.

1254
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:41,202
Who is he?

1255
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:43,938
Mateo Wal-i-Musi.

1256
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:46,908
Mateo Wal-i-Musi?

1257
01:20:53,115 --> 01:20:55,316
Okay, hold on.

1258
01:20:55,317 --> 01:20:58,052
Mateo?

1259
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:01,089
Is that true?

1260
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:12,367
Leave that boy alone!
Leave him alone!

1261
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:15,370
Is that true?

1262
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:20,208
This is your trial!
You fucking cowards!

1263
01:21:27,483 --> 01:21:29,217
Get up!

1264
01:21:30,486 --> 01:21:34,222
Shit, oh, shit!

1265
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:35,957
Fuck, fuck...

1266
01:21:43,432 --> 01:21:47,101
It's crazy!

1267
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:57,512
Why not take me instead?

1268
01:21:57,513 --> 01:22:00,214
Let her go!
Let her go!

1269
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:03,084
Why not take me instead?

1270
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:05,286
It has always been about me!

1271
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:07,355
Come, come, come.

1272
01:22:07,356 --> 01:22:08,456
Frank, no, Frank...

1273
01:22:08,457 --> 01:22:10,625
Quickly, quickly!

1274
01:22:23,972 --> 01:22:26,974
Oh, my God!
The door has just opened!

1275
01:22:26,975 --> 01:22:30,244
And that appears to be
Frank Saltzman.

1276
01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:33,247
I don't know what to say!

1277
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:38,252
Say something, Frank!

1278
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:39,554
Move back!

1279
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:53,134
It seems he has a gun
to his...

1280
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:56,137
Oh, my God!

1281
01:22:59,007 --> 01:23:03,211
Frank!

1282
01:23:16,592 --> 01:23:18,192
Give me it!

1283
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:21,729
Pete!

1284
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:25,333
Are you stupid?
They're gonna shoot us down!

1285
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:28,469
No...

1286
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:33,207
I don't know!

1287
01:23:34,276 --> 01:23:37,345
Okay, go, go.

1288
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:09,410
Everybody down!
Everybody down!

1289
01:24:25,694 --> 01:24:28,663
Hey, hey!

1290
01:24:34,269 --> 01:24:35,670
Ladies and gentlemen...

1291
01:24:35,671 --> 01:24:38,673
I recommend that if you find

1292
01:24:38,674 --> 01:24:42,410
this difficult to watch
as indeed I do,

1293
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:45,479
perhaps you mute your television
for a few moments...

1294
01:24:58,694 --> 01:25:01,729
We've just received
this breaking news...

1295
01:25:06,735 --> 01:25:10,338
Good evening.

1296
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:13,474
Today marks
the one-year anniversary

1297
01:25:13,475 --> 01:25:16,611
of the deadly hijacking
of Nairobi 86.

1298
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:18,746
A tragedy that killed
nine people,

1299
01:25:18,747 --> 01:25:22,216
including four of our fellow
ANC employees.

1300
01:25:22,217 --> 01:25:22,617
Kane Lamprey,

1301
01:25:24,319 --> 01:25:26,754
Juliana Christensen,

1302
01:25:26,755 --> 01:25:28,723
Marcela Descalso,

1303
01:25:28,724 --> 01:25:31,492
and of course,
Frank Saltzman,

1304
01:25:31,493 --> 01:25:34,495
an American news icon.

1305
01:25:36,598 --> 01:25:38,332
Even a year later,

1306
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:41,235
investigators continue to make
shocking discoveries,

1307
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:43,437
after sifting through hours
of footage recovered

1308
01:25:43,438 --> 01:25:47,441
from cameras
on board the plane.

1309
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:50,578
Each new revelation
has sparked a media frenzy.

1310
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:52,446
But has it
also played a part

1311
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:54,582
in the recent decision
to throw out the case

1312
01:25:54,583 --> 01:25:58,319
against alleged pirate
Mateo Wal-i-Musi?

1313
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,187
And will it have
a similar effect

1314
01:26:00,188 --> 01:26:00,755
in the upcoming trial of
the young surviving hijacker?

1315
01:26:05,761 --> 01:26:07,928
Later in the hour we'll have
an exclusive interview

1316
01:26:07,929 --> 01:26:09,497
with Pete Bowers,

1317
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:12,566
one of the only survivors
from that deadly day,

1318
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:14,802
one year ago.
