1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
[indistinct chatter]

2
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
-- Louis!
-- Louis!

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
[indistinct chatter]

4
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
[cheering]

5
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Alright, let's get started.
Go ahead, sit down.

6
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,990
Okay, yes, sit down,
we're just starting.

7
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,990
There's no opening act.
Fuck it. Just, let's start.

8
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,500
Let's just start.

9
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,900
Get your seats.

10
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,100
Get your beers and everybody
go ahead, sit down.

11
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,000
Kill the house lights.
Let's just start.

12
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,990
Let's just start a show.

13
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,500
There's no point in
screwing around.

14
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,690
I'll do all the anouncements
that you would have heard.

15
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,700
Please turn off your cell phones.

16
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,300
You can take pictures but
turn off the flash.

17
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,100
That's stupid,
because it's not--

18
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,790
You know when you're watching the
World Series and there's all that--

19
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Like your flash is lighting
Yankee Stadium.

20
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,800
Just leave your flash off.

21
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Don't yell out during the show.
If you have something you
want to say to me...

22
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,990
This is what we do.
We write it down

23
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,790
and then you go
outside in the lobby

24
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,290
and then you go home and
you kill yourself

25
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,790
because, that's selfish.

26
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,800
This is a rhetorical performance.

27
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,990
It's got nothing to do with you.

28
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,590
Don't text or twitter during
the show. Just live your life.

29
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,090
Don't keep telling people
what you're doing.

30
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,090
Just, because also--

31
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,300
also--

32
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,800
it lights up your big
dumb face. It lights it up.

33
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,600
I see this beautiful see of
darkness and then just one guy.

34
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,690
So, don't do that.

35
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,900
What else? No jews,
I think they said that earlier.

36
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,100
They told me I have to say it.

37
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,390
Jews aren't allowed.

38
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,390
If you're jewish this
is a good time to go.

39
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,390
If you see somebody kind of Jewey
looking then please tell an usher

40
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,900
and they will--

41
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,690
Sir, come on.
Let's go. Come on.

42
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,700
Yes, let's go.

43
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,290
But, I'm really glad you're here.

44
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,300
This is a sizeable crowd.
This is a big place.

45
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,700
There's about 2500 people
here, and that's--

46
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,390
That's a lot of people.

47
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,400
That's enough people to be
a sample of the population.

48
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,100
2500 people is enough people that
you're all going to experience--

49
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:13,000
There's enough people here to
say that within two months
at least one of you will die.

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,200
I'm just saying. I think it's
probably accurate to say

51
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,200
that out of any random
group of 2500 people

52
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,800
not all of you are gonna make
it to Christmas, unfortunately.

53
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,990
There's gonna be--

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
At least one of you here tonight

55
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
is going to ruin your
family's Christmas

56
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,590
by dying a shitty death.

57
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,600
And I don't know
who it is, I'm sorry.

58
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,890
I don't know, your
death is whatever--

59
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,900
Some people, they want you to do
things when they die with their--

60
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,100
"I want you to take my
ashes and sprinkle--"

61
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,700
Fuck you, I'm not doing
none of that shit.

62
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,990
You're dead.

63
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm not going to run errands
for you after you're dead.

64
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,700
You don't matter anymore.

65
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,500
Some people try to do something
noble with their bodies.

66
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,290
They try to have their bodies
have some use after they're dead,

67
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,990
which I think is a good thought.

68
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,790
You're only borrowing your body.

69
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,990
You're only borrowing everything.

70
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,490
If you're body's worth anything
when you're done with it

71
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,390
you should pass it on.

72
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,990
That's something I really believe.

73
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I mean, I'm not going
to do it, because

74
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,200
I don't want--eew--it's mine.
I don't want--

75
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,690
I have a lot of beliefs

76
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,190
and I live by none of them.

77
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,990
That's just the way I am.

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,990
They're just my beliefs.

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,790
I just like believing them.

80
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,890
I like that part.

81
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,800
They're my little believies.
They make me feel good
about who I am.

82
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,590
But if they get in the
way of a thing I want

83
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,590
or I want to jack off or
something, I fucking do that.

84
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,600
But--

85
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,900
But some people take their--
my grandma, uh, grandmother

86
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,500
She--just, uh, for the layman--

87
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,390
My grandmother,

88
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,890
she gave her body to
a medical school

89
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,900
for it just to be
examined and disected,

90
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,390
which is a good thought for that.

91
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,400
But you know her survivors
are--her family---

92
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,990
That was a person.

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That was my grandmother.
She used to wear glasses
and say things.

94
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,300
And now she's just shaved
head on a metal table

95
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,900
with a hungover medical student
trying to dig our her pancreas.

96
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,990
And he gets an "F".

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Imagine being the body where
the kid got an "F" on you.

98
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,590
The teacher's like,
"No, you idiot."

99
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,600
And he writes "F" on her tit
with a Sharpie and just

100
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:53,700
throws her down a shoot
on a pile of "F" bodies.

101
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,900
So, I don't care about her.
[shout from audience] Louis!
Shut up, idiot.

102
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,390
Just shut your fucking mouth.

103
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Didn't you hear me before?

104
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,190
Okay, so what am I going to do
with my body. I'm going to die

105
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,390
and I have to tell people
what to do with my remains.

106
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,890
I have an idea for something
to do with my body

107
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,490
or for other people to do with it,
that will do good in the world.

108
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,790
It doesn't exist yet
as an institution

109
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,990
but I'm gonna create it,
starting with my body.

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,490
What it is, it's a place
where you can go

111
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,190
and be with a dead body

112
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,490
and you just do
whatever you want.

113
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,890
And--

114
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,690
the point of this

115
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,990
is that there are people out there

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
who have sexual compulsions
and they can't control them

117
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,100
and so they go and they
bother alive people.

118
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,290
And with this you get it
out of your system.

119
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,690
This is the deal.
You go in the room.
There's nobody else with you.

120
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,690
You've got 90 minutes.
You just do whatever you
want, whatever it is.

121
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,790
Shit in my mouth.

122
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,990
You want to--

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,490
Stick my toe in your pussy.
Piss on my face.

124
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Whatever is the thing you gotta do.

125
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,790
Jack off with the cartilage of my ear.

126
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Whatever is your heart's desire.

127
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,700
I want to be the Willy Wonka
for perverts.

128
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,490
[singing] You can come on my back
and pretend that I'm your father.

129
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,500
[singing] I am dead, I don't mind.

130
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,300
Sexual perversion is a problem.

131
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
You can't stop it.
People gotta do what they gotta do.

132
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,990
This country is pretty perverted.

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,690
We have to jack off to everything.

134
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,700
There's not sex and then everything.
Sex is in everything.

135
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,490
You watch the news and
there's a woman telling you,

136
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,590
"And in Libya..."

137
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,990
Yeah tell me about Libya.
Fucking tell me about Libya.

138
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,590
Say, "Libya" again.

139
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,090
Come on, fucking right up to
the screen, on my flatscreen.

140
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,590
Come on, say, "Libya" again.

141
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,600
[grunting]

142
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,990
It should just be a person,
"In Libya..." or whatever.

143
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Why does it all have
to be so sexualized?

144
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
And music, every
musician is attractive.

145
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,890
Isn't that a weird coincidence

146
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,390
that everyone who can play
music also looks good?

147
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,290
I would have thought there'd
be one ugly guy with a guitar
who would be amazing.

148
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,300
But, fucking zero.

149
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,400
And there's teen pop idols
who are children.

150
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And they're on TV going--

151
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,390
It's a kid

152
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,400
and folks are jacking off to them.

153
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,500
"Folks."
Just "Folks" are jacking off.

154
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
[singing] Well, folks are jacking
off to the girls on TV.

155
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,100
Some of them are really young.
I don't know their names.

156
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,090
I don't have that
knowledge anymore.

157
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,390
I'm too old.

158
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,400
When I think of a teen idol,
there's Britney Spears.

159
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,590
Because she's my age now.

160
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,490
That's how long ago that was.

161
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,990
She caught up to me.

162
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
When I was 35, she was 18.
And now we're both 44 years old.

163
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,100
So that's how little I know about
who these people are.

164
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,490
I was thinking the other day,

165
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,390
what if there was a
baby who was born

166
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,600
and there's been a lot of fucked up
babies, all kinds of babies born.

167
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,500
There's been babies
connected at the face,

168
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,800
to a dog or whatever,

169
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,390
babies with three legs,

170
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,190
with hands on them.

171
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,590
There's been

172
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,090
Chinese babies.

173
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,290
That's--

174
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,890
Okay, that's--

175
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,900
That's the worst thing I ever said.

176
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,190
I think I just finally said

177
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,000
the worst thing I have ever said.

178
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That was totally
unredeeming and horrible.

179
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,490
And it feels good.

180
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,990
It feels good to have
found bottom.

181
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,990
There's a comfort in knowing

182
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
that I just said the worst thing I'll
ever say in the rest of my life.

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
[exhaling]
It's good.

184
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,200
All right.

185
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,390
Yeah, I'm not a good guy.

186
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,790
I am not.

187
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,490
I wish I was a good guy.

188
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,290
I like the idea of being
a good guy.

189
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,300
Sometimes I have the opportunity
to be a good guy and then I
don't necessarily do it.

190
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,190
I was on a plane once and
I was flying first class,

191
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,990
because I had a thing.

192
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,490
I first class.
Who cares?

193
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,990
Just-- That's the way it is.

194
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,590
I don't-- I'm not like you.

195
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,390
I'm not. I'm not.

196
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,900
All the things you do, I do a
better version of all those things.

197
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,500
And--

198
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,900
It's only for another year at
the most, believe me.

199
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,790
It's not gonna last.

200
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,600
It's been about eight months.
I've got a year left and then I'm
back to being just like you.

201
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,600
But for now, it's pretty good.

202
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm in a first class seat and
first class is so crazily better.

203
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,890
It's so much better.

204
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,590
You get a bigger seat.
You get food.

205
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,490
But also, you get to sit first.

206
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,690
You get to sit before
anybody else does.

207
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,700
They sit you down and you get
to just sit there with champagne

208
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,100
and watch all the sweaty,

209
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,890
miserable,

210
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,900
all the single moms hefting
their stroller and the kid.

211
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,400
"That looks heavy and nobody's
helping you. That's a drag."

212
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,100
And you get to just--

213
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,390
Anyway, so I'm on the plane.
I'm in first class

214
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,790
and this soldier gets on the plane.

215
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,490
I see soldiers fly all the time

216
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,290
because that's how they
get to the war.

217
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,790
They fly on a shitty airline.

218
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,090
You think they get to go on a
cool green plane with a red light.

219
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,890
"Go! Go! Go!"

220
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,490
No, they just go to Delta.

221
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,290
And they just

222
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,300
wait in line to go to a war.

223
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,190
And they always fly coach.

224
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,590
I've never seen a soldier in
first class in my life.

225
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,490
It could be a full bird colonel,

226
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,390
he's between two fat
guys in coach.

227
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,890
And they're always nice.

228
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,390
I've never seen a soldier
get on a plane--
"Hey, I'm in the Army."

229
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,400
"Fuck you. I have a gun."

230
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,190
They're always, "Oh, yes sir.
Thank you very much ma'am."

231
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,200
It's like having an extra flight attendant.
They help everybody put their shit up.

232
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,090
They're awesome.

233
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,790
And every time that I see a
soldier on a plane, I always think,

234
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,990
You know what,
I should give him my seat.

235
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,390
It would be the right thing to do.
It would be easy to do and it
would mean a lot to him.

236
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,090
I could go up to him, "Hey, Son."
I get to call him, "Son."

237
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,590
"Hey, son, go ahead
and take my seat."

238
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,800
Because I'm in first class, why,
for being a professional asshole.

239
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,790
I'm in first class because I talk
about babies with big dicks.

240
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,800
That's what got me my seat.

241
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,700
This guy is giving his life
for the country, he thinks,
and so he has to sit--

242
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,390
But that's good enough.
That's good enough,

243
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,490
the fact that he thinks it.

244
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,190
I'm serious.

245
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,690
He's fucking told by everybody
in his life system

246
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,690
that that's a great thing
to do and he's doing it.

247
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,190
And it's scary but he's doing it.

248
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,790
And he's sitting in this shitty seat
and I should trade with him.

249
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,490
I never have.
Let me make that clear.

250
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,090
I've never done it once.

251
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,190
I've had so many opportunities.

252
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,200
I never even really,
seriously came close.

253
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,290
And here's the worst part.

254
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,300
I still just enjoy the fantasy

255
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,200
for myself to enjoy.

256
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,400
I was actually proud of myself

257
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,090
for having thought of it.

258
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,690
I was proud.

259
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Ah, I am such a sweet man.

260
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,290
That is so nice of me

261
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,300
to think of that and then
totally never do it.

262
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,490
At least you should be good
just to the people--

263
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,700
Just turn a good face to the
people that you see in life.

264
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,090
I don't do that either

265
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,490
because when I get in the
elevator in my building--

266
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,500
That's my first contact
with human beings after

267
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,600
being home and just being
disgusting for hours.

268
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Then I come out of the elevator
and there's always a guy on
the elevator who's nice.

269
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,990
And I hate it.

270
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,990
I get really upset when people
say nice things to me.

271
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,390
That's not a good impulse.

272
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,390
I get in the elevator and there's
always this one guy who just--

273
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,090
He sticks his face right in the
front of his fucking head.

274
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,100
"Hi!" He just floats it out
there like a big balloon.

275
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,000
"Hey, how's it going?"

276
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,090
I get upset.
I get cagey.

277
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,590
I get this weird impulse that
I want to cum on his face.

278
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,990
I don't know why that's the thing,

279
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,990
but that's what I think about.

280
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,500
I wish I could just secrete cum 
without the sexual workup,

281
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
like as a defense,
like a squid or a skunk.

282
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Not sexually. I mean agressively.

283
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,290
"Hi!"
[spurt]

284
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,190
"Jesus, man."

285
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,200
"You just came in my eye."

286
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,100
I just want to go downstairs.
I don't want to talk.

287
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,300
Alright, this is going a little off the
rails. I don't remember what I was

288
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,990
trying to say.

289
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'd like to be a better person.

290
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,290
I would.

291
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,290
I'd like to be a better person.

292
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,690
And I think I'm getting
worse as a person.

293
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,990
Because as you get older
you start finding out--

294
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,390
Let me give you an example.

295
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,390
I rented a car a couple weeks
ago, in Los Angeles

296
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,190
I had the car for a few days

297
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,690
and then when I went home I had
to drop the car at the rental place.

298
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,700
You gotta go to the rental place
that's off the airport,

299
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,990
give them the car, give them
your thing with the mileage.

300
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,990
You gotta get on a bus and then
go to your terminal and check in.

301
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,790
I was late and I was worried
about missing my flight.

302
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,090
So I knew I had no time
to do any of that.

303
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,790
So I just
--I never did this before--
I just drove my car

304
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,800
right to the terminal
and just left it there.

305
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,700
Then I got on the plane.

306
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Once I got on the plane and
had a moment I called
Hertz and I said,

307
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,200
Hey, listen, your car is sitting
out in front of terminal four

308
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,300
and the keys are in it.
So, that's where it is."

309
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,190
And the guy's like,
"You can't do that."

310
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,990
"You have to return it to
the location and then get--"

311
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,500
Well, I didn't do that already,
and now I'm leaving California.

312
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,700
So if you want your car you need
to go to that place where it is.

313
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,990
And he was like,
"Awww, Jesus man."

314
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
"Well, alright. We'll get it."

315
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,300
And he-- That was the end of it.

316
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,300
And I realized I could
do this every time,

317
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,390
every time I rented a car.

318
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,090
Because of course they want
you to do all that shit.

319
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,100
But if you don't they
still want the car back.

320
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,990
They're going to send a dude.

321
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,990
You could drive a car until
you don't want it.

322
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Just get out of it while it's
moving and just walk away.

323
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,200
No, I don't feel like being
in that car any longer.

324
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,300
Just call Hertz.
Hi, your car is drifting into the
intersection of 28th and Broadway,

325
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,800
if you're interested.
It's now your problem.

326
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,700
But see, this is a
terrible realization

327
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,490
because you should act in a way

328
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
that if everybody acted that
way things would work out.

329
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,600
You should, because it would be
mayhem if everybody was like that.

330
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,790
And most people kind of don't care.

331
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,490
Most people are very selfish.

332
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,090
Most people don't give
a shit what happens

333
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,100
as long as they get to
do their favorite thing.

334
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,800
People don't even want to back
off from their favorite thing.

335
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,090
They won't even do their
second favorite thing.

336
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,790
You ever seen somebody in trouble,

337
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,690
like they're at an intersection
and they want to make a left,

338
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,090
but they're in the right--
the all the way right lane

339
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,100
because they messed up.

340
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,190
So, here's the guy.
He's in the right lane.

341
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,200
And there's a lot cars,
like 6th avenue.
A lot of cars.

342
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,490
And he wants to make that left.

343
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,590
So what does he do?
He just does it anyway.

344
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,290
He just goes at it.

345
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,300
He just shoves his car

346
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,590
through everybody's life

347
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,090
without any--

348
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,100
And everybody's honking and
outraged and you always
see they guy go,

349
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,500
"I have to. I have to."

350
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,700
"There's no other possible
thing I could do."

351
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,290
"What else could I do, except
go up one more block

352
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,300
and then go left and
take four seconds."

353
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,600
"That's not my favorite way, though!"

354
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,900
"That only meets 99% of my criteria."

355
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,800
But I'm selfish.

356
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,200
I would like to be a better person,
because I have kids.

357
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,290
And I want to pass on a better--

358
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,190
Sometimes it's not clear what
the right thing is to do.

359
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,200
One time I threw a candy
wrapper on the street.

360
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,700
I didn't do it like, "Yeah!"

361
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,090
I just--

362
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,100
Yeah, take that shit, street.

363
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,800
I did it because I was shaking.
I wanted the candy.

364
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,300
Anyway, I was with a friend

365
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,600
who said to me, "You just littered
on the street. Don't you care
about the environment?"

366
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,400
And I thought about it and I said,
You know what, this
isn't 'The Environment'.

367
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,590
This is New York City.

368
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,790
This is not 'The Environment'.

369
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,290
This is where people live.

370
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,300
New York City is not the environment.
New York City is a giant piece of litter.

371
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,400
It's the giantest, next to Mexico
City, the shittiest piece of litter

372
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,890
in the world.

373
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,900
Just a pussy, runny, smoking,

374
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,690
stinking piece of litter.

375
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,090
So if you have a piece of litter,

376
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,490
what are you supposed
to do with it?

377
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,090
You should throw it
on the pile of litter.

378
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,690
Because if you don't,
if you put it in a receptacle

379
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,090
then it gets collected and
it gets taken to a dump

380
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,590
and a landfill and then
it goes on a boat.

381
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,590
And it goes out and gets
dumped in the ocean and

382
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,600
some dolphin wears it
as a hat on its face

383
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:37,800
for ten years, this hat that
never dissolves, on its face.

384
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,690
Ugh.

385
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,700
Jesus.

386
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,800
[dolphin clicking]

387
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Everything that we introduce

388
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,990
to the world is shitty...

389
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,590
...meaning white people.

390
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,100
Because--

391
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,300
I really think that white people
are from another planet

392
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,900
because when we came to
America, it was so nice.

393
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,890
It was just Indians.

394
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,790
And they weren't even Indians.

395
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,800
We called them that by accident.

396
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And we still call them that.

397
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,600
We knew in a month
that it wasn't Indians

398
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,090
but we just don't give a shit.

399
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,100
We never correct it.

400
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,190
We came here.
They're like, "Hi."

401
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,890
And we're like,
"Hey, you're Indians, right?"

402
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,190
And they're like, "No."

403
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,190
"No, this is India, right?"

404
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,190
"No, it's not. It's a totally other place."

405
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,390
"You're not Indians?"

406
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,990
"No."

407
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
"Ahh, you're Indians."

408
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,700
"You're Indians for hundreds
of years after."

409
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,490
We ruined everything here.
This was the great--

410
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,000
It was just coast-to-coast
green, brown and beautiful.

411
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,490
And all the humans were
just walking around

412
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,290
with painted faces,
just walking.

413
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,390
And they'd be like,
"Oh, that looks yummy."

414
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,390
And they'd just eat from the ground.

415
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,390
And then they'd sleep on the grass.

416
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,190
And they'd wake up and they'd fuck.

417
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,200
And then they'd go for a swim
and do a little dance.

418
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,490
That was the whole continent,

419
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,500
just folks doing that.

420
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,990
I mean there was people in
Mexico cutting off kids' heads

421
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,090
and rolling them down
the pyramid stairs.

422
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,990
But that's--

423
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,590
I mean...

424
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,190
That's always going on.

425
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,590
You know--

426
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,600
You can't do a whole
lot about that.

427
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,990
But I think we came
from another planet

428
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,690
and the reason is we
don't like it here.

429
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,390
Why, if we're from here,

430
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,990
if we belong on Earth,

431
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
why aren't we comfortable

432
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,690
on Earth, at all?

433
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,290
We need nice smooth surfaces

434
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,790
and right angles and we
need it to be cool

435
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,100
and not too hot, just a
little dit-dit just perfect.

436
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,390
Why wouldn't, when it's hot,
why wouldn't we just--

437
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,590
"Yeah, fuck it."

438
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
Why wouldn't we be like
that if we belonged here?

439
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,600
And it's weird because
people that are--

440
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,390
You know, there's
environmentalists

441
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,400
and there's people who
just hate environmentalists.

442
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,390
People get angry
at environmentalists

443
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,990
because they think they're
slowing down the economy

444
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,490
and creating restrictions and a lot
of these people are Christian.

445
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,990
A lot of these people are
very devout Christians

446
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,390
and that's such a
confusing thing to me,

447
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,400
that if you believe that
God gave you the Earth,

448
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,790
that God created Earth for you,

449
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,400
why would you not
have to look after it?

450
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,990
Why the fuck--

451
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,990
Why would you not think that when
he came back he wouldn't go,

452
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
"What the fuck did you do?"

453
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,400
"I gave this to you, motherfucker.
Are you crazy?"

454
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,300
"The polar bears are brown."

455
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,600
"What did you do to the polar bears?"

456
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,100
"Did you shit all over
every polar bear?"

457
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:17,100
"What did you--who did this?
Who spilled this shit?
Who spilled this?"

458
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,000
"Come over here. Did you
fucking spill this? What is that?"

459
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,400
"It's oil. It's just some oil.
I didn't mean to spill--"

460
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,600
"Well why did you take it
out of the fucking ground?"

461
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,300
"Because I wanted to go faster."

462
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,400
"I'm not fast enough."

463
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,790
"And I was cold."

464
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,990
"What the fuck do you mean, 'cold'?"

465
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
"I gave you everything you
needed, you piece of shit."

466
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,500
"Well, because jobs, and I wanted--"

467
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,700
"What is a job? Explain to me,
what's a fucking job?"

468
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,390
"Well, like you work at a
place and people call

469
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,400
when their game doesn't work
and you help them figure it out."

470
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,890
"What do you do that for?"

471
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,490
"For money."

472
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,890
"What do you need money for?"

473
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,490
"Food."

474
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,490
"Just eat the shit on the floor."

475
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,500
"I left shit all over the floor."

476
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,800
"Fucking corn and wheat and shit.
Grind it up, make some bread.
What are you doing?"

477
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,990
"Yeah, but it doesn't have,
like, bacon around it."

478
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
"And like-- I like when it
has bacon on it."

479
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,300
I watched somebody do that the
other day after a meal they went,
"Oh, it was just--"

480
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,600
And I started wondering,
what does that mean?
What does that signify?

481
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,990
I think what it means is that you
ate something so delicious

482
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,200
that you then kissed
somebody on the asshole

483
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
and their asshole exploded.

484
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,090
That's some good eating.

485
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,790
That's a nice sauce.

486
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,490
"Is that good?"

487
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,890
"Yeah, let me show you."

488
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,900
"Shit. Let me have some of that."

489
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,300
That just destroyed my anus.

490
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,600
Anyway, I got kids and

491
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,500
that's sort of what I'm trying to say.

492
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,600
It's hard having kids
because it's boring.

493
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,790
That really is the hardest
part of having kids.

494
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Ask any parent, What's the hard part?
Is it looking after their health care?

495
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,090
Is it making sure that their education--

496
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,100
No, it's being with them on the floor

497
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,590
while they be children.

498
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,890
It's just--

499
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,900
They read Clifford the
Big Red Dog to you

500
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,490
at a rate of 50 minutes a page.

501
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,290
And you have to sit there

502
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,890
and be horribly proud and bored

503
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,590
at the same time.

504
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,590
I hate Clifford the Big Red Dog.

505
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,890
I hate him.

506
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,590
There's 50 books about
Clifford the Big Red Dog.

507
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,190
Fifty books.

508
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,390
There's seven books about Narnia

509
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,090
that cover the birth and death of a nation

510
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,990
and mice with swords

511
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,990
and a lion who's a god.

512
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,990
They did it in seven books.

513
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,790
Fifty books about
Clifford the Big Red Dog,

514
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,690
and they all tell the exact same story.

515
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,290
Look how big this dog is.

516
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,300
That's it.

517
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,090
Look how big this dog is.

518
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,790
That's the whole book.

519
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,800
Here's how big he was at the firehouse.

520
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Here's how big he was at Thanksgiving.

521
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,400
Who gives a shit?
You just drew him big.

522
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,500
You just, on purpose, made
him bigger than people.

523
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,600
It should be, "Look how big
I drew the dog in this book."

524
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,290
"Isn't that a mistake?"

525
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,790
There's no story.

526
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,400
You maybe even just drew him
closer to the page. I don't even
know if you did it honestly.

527
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,690
Tell a story about Clifford.

528
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,000
Make something happen, where
maybe he steps on a policeman

529
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,500
and shatters his spine and it's
devastating to the community.

530
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,800
He hangs on for two months and then dies.

531
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,490
And there's a whole, you know,

532
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,500
funeral with bagpipes and
everybody's crying.

533
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,100
And Clifford gets the death penalty.

534
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,600
There's a whole book about
his appeal process and how

535
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
he found Jesus but everybody
said it was bullshit.

536
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,600
The cop's wife was like,
"I want that dog dead!"

537
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,700
And then he goes to the chair
and they shave all his red
fur off and now he's

538
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,300
Clifford the Big Pink Dog.

539
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Put him on a big funny electric
chair that the town got
together and built.

540
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,890
It's boring having kids.
You gotta play kid games.

541
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,900
You gotta play board games,
little kid board games where you--

542
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,700
And then you go dit-dit-dit

543
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,100
You got a six, honey.

544
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,990
One.

545
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,790
Two.

546
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,290
Three.

547
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,300
It's just here. Just go here. It's just--

548
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,590
Daddy, I'm learning.

549
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,300
I know. You're going to grow up
stupid because I'm bored. I
can't take it, baby. I can't.

550
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,990
I can't watch it.

551
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I'm bored more than I love you.
I can't. I just--

552
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,600
Come on.

553
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,690
My girls are six and nine now.

554
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,700
They're actually a really exciting
age because they're learning
to do some cool stuff.

555
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,390
I played Monopoly with my kids.
That's really fun.

556
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,990
My nine year old, she can
totally do Monopoly.

557
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,990
The six year old actually totally
gets how the game works

558
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
but she's not emotionally
developed enough

559
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,400
to handle her inevitable loss

560
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,990
in every game of Monopoly.

561
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Because, a Monopoly loss is dark.

562
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,290
It's heavy.

563
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,300
It's not like when you lose at Candyland.

564
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Oh, you got stuck in the fudgey
thing, baby. Oh, well.

565
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,500
You're in the gummy twirly-ohs
and you didn't get to win.

566
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,490
But when she loses at Monopoly I
gotta look at her little face and go,

567
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,500
Okay, sweetie, here's what's
gonna happen now, okay?

568
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,100
All your property,
everything you have,

569
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,190
all your railroads, your houses,

570
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,990
all your money,

571
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,690
that's mine now.

572
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,290
Gotta give it all to me.

573
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,990
No, give it to me. That's right.

574
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
No, no you can't play
anymore, see, because

575
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,090
even though you're giving me all of that

576
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,990
it doesn't even touch how
much you owe me.

577
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It doesn't even touch it, baby.

578
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,500
You're going down hard. It's really bad.

579
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,500
All you've been working for all day,

580
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,990
I'm going to take it now

581
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
and I'm going to use it to
destroy your sister.

582
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,800
I mean, I'm going to ruin her.

583
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,200
It's just mayhem on this
board for her now.

584
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,290
When you have kids you also have to

585
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,690
belong to kid and parent culture.

586
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,990
You have to know a lot of parents
and a lot of other kids.

587
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,290
You have to hang out
with other kids.

588
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,090
Sometimes they're not
even kids you know.

589
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,790
When I go to parks with my
kids, I play with them.

590
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,290
I play with my kids.

591
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,790
Some people don't do that.

592
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,800
They just take their kids to the park
so they don't have to talk to them,

593
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
and those kids kind of
glom on to our shit.

594
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,490
I'll be sitting at the park playing
a fun game with my kids

595
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,290
and there's this woman on a
bench. She's got her phone

596
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,990
and she's just staring at her phone.

597
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,690
And her kid's like, "Mommy, talk to me."

598
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,700
"Leave me alone. I'm trying to cheat on your father! Stop it!"

599
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,190
And then the kid comes up to us,
"Can I be in your family?"

600
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,390
It's creepy.

601
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,400
One time I was at a swimming
pool with my kids, a public pool.

602
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,490
I had my daughter, my six
year old, on my arm like this.

603
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,500
She was like clamped on, and
she's kicking. It was so much fun.

604
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:08,800
And then she got off and another
random child just clamped on.

605
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,790
It's like a rat. Get off of me.

606
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,990
"But I love you."

607
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I don't know you, kid. Stop.

608
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,400
I think that kid's dead. I don't
know what happened.

609
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,400
Some kids in my kid's class,
I like some of those kids.

610
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Some of those kids are cool. They
come over to my house and they
play with my--I like them.

611
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,290
Other kids I don't like,

612
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,090
especially the little boys.

613
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,100
Little boys in my kid's class,
I hate them. I hate little boys.

614
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I'm like the opposite of a
pedophile. I just hate--

615
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:01,600
There's one kid in my daughter's
class who I hate so much,

616
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
and it's really fucked up because I'm 44

617
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,600
and I hate a six year old.

618
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,590
I mean, I hate him

619
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,600
with a grown-up, pre-occupying hate.

620
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I've thought about him three
times since I came out here.

621
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,500
That's how much I really hate this kid.

622
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,100
I'm going to tell you about him and
I have to make up a name
because he's a real child

623
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,490
who lives in this city, so I have to

624
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,390
make up a name in order to
tell this story about him.

625
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,790
His name is just, Jezanthepuss.

626
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,300
Let's just call him Jezanthepuss.
Jezanthepuss. Fine.

627
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,000
Okay.

628
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,790
He's in my daughter's class.
They're in first grade.

629
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,100
When we take our kids to class,
there's a little procedure.

630
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,200
You bring your kid to school and
they have their backpack
and their jacket

631
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,600
and they go to their cubby
and take it all off and they
put it in the cubby.

632
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:01,290
Then they take their homework
folder and their lunchbox

633
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,690
and put them in the bins.

634
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,390
Those are their little responsibilities.

635
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,690
You help them do it so
they'll, blah blah blah.

636
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,700
But, Jezanthepuss--

637
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,500
When he comes in he doesn't
do none of that shit.

638
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,300
He just walks in and just sheds it all.

639
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:29,900
And his mom, his weak, piece of shit mom

640
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:33,990
picks it all up.

641
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,090
I hate his mother

642
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,100
because you hate a weak
parent, when you're a parent.

643
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,500
Because it's like you're raising
Hitler, motherfucker. Do your job!

644
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,990
Get in there.

645
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
If our parent group and our class
were a platoon of soldiers,

646
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,500
she'd be the one that we'd
put soap bars in socks and--

647
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,690
We'd frag that bitch in her sleep.

648
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,990
She would wash right the fuck out.

649
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
She wouldn't make it.

650
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,590
When Jezanthepuss drops his shit,

651
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,890
this bitch picks it up.

652
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,990
She just goes,

653
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
"He just... I'll get..."

654
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,990
"I'll get it..."

655
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
"And then I'll put it in the bins for him."

656
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:25,400
And she puts it all away for him,
which frees him up to punch
other kids in the face

657
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,300
because he's a shitty,
horrible, violent child.

658
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,990
One time I was at school,

659
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,190
and I was volunteering at recess.

660
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,390
It's something you do, you know,

661
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,590
if you're a good parent,

662
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,190
about once a month
or whatever it is.

663
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,390
You go to school

664
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,990
and you just stand there
and you watch recess.

665
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You masturbate, whatever
you want to do.

666
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,690
That is now the worst thing.
That's the worst thing.

667
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,290
Now that's the worst thing I
ever said. Okay. Alright.

668
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,800
We'll find it.

669
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,400
I mean you could. It's a public
school nobody would even give a shit.

670
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,700
But, I haven't thus far.
It hasn't gotten that bad.

671
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,490
Anyway, I'm watching recess
and recess is a trip.

672
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,500
If you've never been to recess,

673
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,400
it's intense because it's
like the universe.

674
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,990
You know if you watch the ocean crash,

675
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,390
waves on the beach for a long time,

676
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,400
you start feeling like you're
understanding how everything works.

677
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,300
That's what recess is like, because
every natural, chaotic energy

678
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,090
is represented at recess.

679
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,600
There's kids swirling around in
these big roiling crazy things.

680
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:41,900
There's one kid just spazzing
out just to some singularity kid.

681
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,990
It's a binary system of two
kids holding hands

682
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,500
and they're running and just
clotheslining every child
of a certain height.

683
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,300
They're keeping a uniform
height to the playground.

684
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,290
So I'm watching recess

685
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,290
and I see Jezanthepuss.

686
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,990
And he's walking with this evil--

687
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,690
This kid is like evil stuck out of time.

688
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,790
He's like--

689
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,800
I always picture him in a gray
fur coat with bones in it,

690
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
and lots of rings from people
that he killed, and just walking.

691
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,500
And then I see my daughter and
she's standing there, just by herself.

692
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,090
And there's Jezanthepuss and
I know he's going for her.

693
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:29,100
It was like an action movie thriller thing.

694
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,200
And I think to myself, I gotta go
there and I gotta protect her.

695
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,400
But then I thought, let him do
a little something first.

696
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,490
Let him do just a little something,

697
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,500
because I want this kid in my life.

698
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,500
I want a reason.

699
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,300
I want aerial photos of him
doing some shit to my family

700
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,590
that I can bring to the U.N.

701
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,490
and get authority to waterboard
this little motherfucker.

702
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,490
I want to--

703
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,990
I want to get him on a
flight to Venezuela

704
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
with an envelope on his head
and duct tape and all that shit.

705
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,800
So, anyway, he goes for her,
grabs her arm, starts twisting it.

706
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,190
She goes, "Ahhh!"

707
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,490
I run over. I'm just knocking kids over.

708
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,390
I run, grab him.

709
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,990
I look in his little face and I go,

710
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Listen to me, Jezanthepuss.

711
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,290
If you ever,

712
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,790
ever, in your life,

713
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,590
touch her again--

714
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,490
And as I'm doing this I realize

715
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,290
this is not cool that doing this.

716
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,890
This is totally inappropriate.

717
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,790
It's really wrong.

718
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,800
It's way over the top.

719
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,990
It's too grown up.

720
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,700
It's like he's a drug dealer in
my building that I finally fucking--

721
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,800
"This ends now, motherfucker
or I will cut you. I don't care."

722
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,390
And he's--

723
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,390
He starts crying pitifully.

724
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,400
And I just, I really did this, I just
walked away from him. I just got away.

725
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,190
And then all the teachers--
everybody gathers around.

726
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,090
Jezanthepuss, what's wrong with you?

727
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,100
And he's like--

728
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,090
And he couldn't articulate it

729
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,190
because he's not getting educated.

730
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,290
Fuck him.

731
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,790
I was there going, Yeah, you could
have told on me bitch,

732
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,990
but you're too stupid now,

733
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
which is your own fault,

734
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,400
you future ditchdigging piece of shit.

735
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,400
Oh, I'm going to love watching you
grow up into nothing, motherfucker.

736
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,590
I'm gonna watch it.

737
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,600
I'm gonna fuck your mom
and not call her too.

738
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,800
I'm gonna ruin her summer.

739
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,800
I'm gonna fuck your mom twice
and then never call her.

740
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,990
I don't know your dad because he ran
out on you, but I'm gonna find him.

741
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,790
I'm gonna turn myself gay and
then I'm going to fuck him too.

742
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,590
I'm gonna fuck--
I'm gonna suck his dick so good

743
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,600
that he just has to change
his whole life.

744
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And I'm gonna move into a place with
him in the village for a couple
of months and totally--

745
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,990
He'll cut off ties to all his life

746
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,990
and start wearing cut-offs
that are really tight.

747
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,190
And he'll just--

748
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,200
And then I'll go to some Christian
turn-you-not-gay place.

749
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,390
And then I'll come back and go,
"What's wrong with you faggot?"

750
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,400
Make him feel bad inside,
like what has he done.

751
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,190
But you gotta protect your
kids, you know. You gotta.

752
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,200
You gotta protect your kids.

753
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,400
You gotta do it, man.

754
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,100
A lot of people will talk the talk.

755
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,290
A lot of people say that shit.
"I would throw myself under a bus for my--"

756
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,790
Oh, yeah, would you fuck another kid's dad,

757
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,800
and confuse him sexually,
and yourself sexually in the process,

758
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
and use homophobia that you
hate, against another person,

759
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,400
just because some kid shoved
your kid for a second?

760
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,290
That's my baby girl. I gotta do it, son.

761
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:16,300
I gotta suck that dick.
That's my baby girl.
I gotta do it for her.

762
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,300
Alright.

763
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Alright.

764
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Alright, I hate that child.
That's what I'm trying to say.

765
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:29,190
I've been thinking about my
memories because I have kids now.

766
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,390
And my kids are at an age

767
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,490
where I remember being their age.

768
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,990
I remember being a six year old.

769
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,090
I remember being a nine year old.

770
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,590
And that's a big threshold
that my kids have crossed,

771
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,290
that I remember being their age.

772
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:43,300
Because when you're raising kids,
you're not raising the kid in front of you.

773
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,390
You're raising the grown up
that they're going to be later.

774
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,990
And I was a kid once.

775
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,700
When they were babies, I didn't really
relate to them because they're babies.

776
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,890
A baby is not going to remember shit

777
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,590
that is happening to it.

778
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,390
If you have a baby, keep it
alive and enjoy yourself.

779
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,400
But really, the baby doesn't--
It's not going to matter.

780
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,890
A baby is not accumulating anything.

781
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,990
It's like an Etch A Sketch
that you shake every day.

782
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,890
It doesn't really--
It doesn't matter.

783
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:14,390
You could go up to your baby's face
every day and say, "Fuck you, baby."
every day and it wouldn't matter.

784
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,400
Hey, baby!

785
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,490
You could do that every day
and it wouldn't matter.

786
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,500
I mean, they'll grow up with
a general sadness inside.

787
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,600
But they won't--

788
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
They won't actually remember why.

789
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,200
And memories are weird because memories
get distorted by who you are now

790
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,990
and who you were when
you experienced them.

791
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,790
I remember when I first
started doing stand-up.

792
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,800
I was living in Boston and there was one
club that was owned by a gay guy.

793
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,500
And my memory is that that guy
was always trying to fuck me.

794
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,590
That's my memory.

795
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,290
I've carried it for 20 years.

796
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,300
There was a gay guy who
tried to fuck me all the time.

797
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,100
And recently I caught up with an old
friend of mine from those days,
who I hadn't seen in years.

798
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,290
And we started talking about different
people and he brought him up.

799
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,990
And I said, "That guy always
used to try to fuck me."

800
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,490
And he goes, "He did?"

801
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,290
And I was like, "Yeah."

802
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,990
And he goes,
"Really? Did he--"

803
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:13,200
"I mean, did he like take you
to his house or something
and really try to physically..."

804
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,400
No, it's just that, you know what I mean.
He was trying to fuck me all the time."

805
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,190
And he was like, "Well did he
say-- Did he push you--

806
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,890
and say stuff all the time
and make you uncomfortable?"

807
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,090
No, it just was--

808
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:29,100
And as we went through it,
the truth came out.

809
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,200
The whole story really was,
there once was a gay man.

810
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,090
That's it.

811
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,990
That's really what happened.

812
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,990
He was gay.

813
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,290
I was 19.

814
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:43,300
And now, "He tried to fuck me all the time."

815
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,500
I went through life with that.

816
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,490
But I've been trying to
remember my first memory.

817
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,690
How far do my memories go?

818
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,490
And I remembered my first memory.

819
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,190
I was four years old.

820
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,190
I was standing in front of my parents' house

821
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,200
and I was shitting in my pants.

822
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,290
I was just shitting a massive,

823
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,990
terribly painful shit.

824
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,500
And I was half way through the shit.
That's my first memory, being half way--

825
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,090
The first half of the shit, I don't remember it.

826
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:16,100
That's still in the ether of infancy.

827
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:20,500
The center of this shit was so wide

828
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,100
that I actually came online as a result

829
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,100
of the anal pain that I was experiencing.

830
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,290
It actually awakened me
--Yee-aahhh--

831
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:35,300
into the stream of consciousness
that I'm now living.

832
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,200
That's how my life started. That's who I am.

833
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,990
A lot of my memories I don't like.

834
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,490
I don't like-- When I was a
teen-ager I hated all that time.

835
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,590
I hated being a teen-ager,

836
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:57,090
and then I discovered drugs.

837
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,890
And then that's all I gave a shit about.

838
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,990
I don't know how I'm gonna tell my kids.

839
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,190
How the fuck do you compete with that.

840
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:07,200
How do you take a miserable person
with no control over their lives

841
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,190
and tell them with a straight face,

842
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,290
Uh, You can't do drugs.

843
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,190
You can't do that, baby.

844
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,000
All drugs are, are a perfect solution to
every problem you have right now.

845
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,100
How do you beat that?

846
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,090
Drugs are so fucking good

847
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,390
that they'll ruin your life.

848
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,190
That's how good they are.

849
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,200
I can't do drugs now because I'm 44

850
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,390
and I can't hook it up.
I can't make that happen.

851
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,390
If you're 44 and you want to get
high, you gotta hurt your back.

852
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,290
That's pretty much the
only option you have.

853
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,390
Hurt your back, get some Percoset.

854
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,400
And then get a babysitter
and take three at a diner.

855
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,090
Just, sad.

856
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,100
I'm a little drowsy, woooo!

857
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,700
I never really could have--
I wish I was a drunk.

858
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,500
I love romantically the idea
of being a real drunk,

859
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,100
in my bathrobe all day.

860
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,400
Everybody who love's me is always
crying. "He's destroying himself.
I can't watch anymore."

861
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Shut up then.

862
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,190
Showing up at my kids school
play half way through.

863
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,200
"You show 'em who you are, baby."

864
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
I wish I could be that guy.

865
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,590
But I can't drink because I just get tired.

866
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,090
I go to sleep.

867
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,100
I don't know how people
drink and then do shit.

868
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,190
When I see movies or TV shows
where there's people in an office

869
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,290
having a power meeting and they're
--clink clink--

870
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,300
They're making a drink in
the daylight with a tie on.

871
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,390
"Well, Senator, I hope you play ball with us

872
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,290
on this construction deal,
if you know what I'm saying."

873
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:48,300
"Yeah, we'll see what's in it for me."

874
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,290
How is the next scene not all those people

875
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,290
just lying on the floor going, "Oh, fuck"

876
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,300
"I can't believe I drank whiskey at noon."

877
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,800
I can't smoke pot because-- It's the
same thing. I'm too old for it.

878
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,990
Sometimes young people come
up to me after shows.

879
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,490
"Hey, do you want to smoke some pot."

880
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,500
I'm like, Can I get my portion to smoke
without you, alone, later, because

881
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I don't want to stand in a parking
lot with some twenty year-olds.

882
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,790
Last time I got high I was in Kansas City.

883
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,800
And I got high because I was
in Kansas City. It was shitty.

884
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,790
So after the show,

885
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,990
these kids that worked at
the club were like, "You
want to smoke some pot?"

886
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,990
I'm like, "Yes."

887
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,000
So, I'm standing in a
parking lot with these kids,

888
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,390
like 20 years old, and
we're smoking a joint.

889
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:38,090
And I'm taking huge hits
because I had no idea.

890
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,990
I didn't know they had been working on
this shit like it's the cure for cancer.

891
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I didn't understand the fucking technology
that's gone into making pot so powerful.

892
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,090
Because when I was a kid you could
just smoke a joint for a while.

893
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,100
Now you take two hits and you go insane.

894
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,790
It's not doable anymore.

895
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,500
And I was taking big hits, like big 1970's,

896
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,100
jean jacket, Bad Company hits.

897
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,400
[singing] Here come the
Jesters, one, two, three.

898
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,200
[singing] It's all part of my fantasy.

899
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:17,290
And I'm like, "Yeah"

900
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:20,300
And even the kid with the wooden

901
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,290
hole of no ear

902
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,300
the absense of flesh in
his ear, with wood.

903
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,400
I don't know what that is.

904
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,990
Even he was like,

905
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,000
"You should be careful. That's a lot
of pot. That's very strong marijuana."

906
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,790
Yeah, I'm fine.

907
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,290
[singing] "Running with the devil."

908
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:44,300
And in about ten seconds, everything just--

909
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And I'm like, "Oh, shit."

910
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
This is an ordeal now.

911
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I'm not going to feel okay
for a very long time.

912
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,800
[sigh]

913
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,490
And everybody's just standing
around and talking.

914
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,890
And I'm hoping,

915
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,590
I'm really hoping,

916
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,600
that I look like this.

917
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,190
But I'm pretty sure

918
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,200
that I was just scanning insanely.

919
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,590
I was actually counting.

920
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,090
Look at her for five...

921
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:39,790
four...

922
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,490
three...

923
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,290
two...

924
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,290
...one.
Switch to him.

925
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,290
Five...

926
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,090
four...

927
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:44,490
three...

928
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,290
...two. Randomize. Don't
go in the same direction.

929
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,290
Five...

930
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:47,690
four...

931
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:50,700
...three. Nod your head. That looks like
you're listening if you nod your head.

932
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,400
And at one point I realized,
I need to get out of here,

933
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,600
because the air is hitting my
arm weirdly and they can tell.

934
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,690
They totally know

935
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,700
that I am not handling the way
air is touching my arm right now.

936
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,590
Why am I doing that with my hand.
That's weird to do with your hand.

937
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,990
Nobody stands like this.
Nobody stands like this.

938
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,590
Just fucking--
No, that's also--

939
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,890
That's weird too.
That's crazy.

940
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,990
Just--

941
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,690
Shit.

942
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,090
I gotta go.

943
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,490
But I didn't know how to leave,
because I had this dilema.

944
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,500
We're all standing in a perfect
circle, facing each other.

945
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,790
And I thought it's going to be
insane if I just turn my--

946
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,800
I'm one person with my back now.

947
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,400
Do I just back away like this

948
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,500
and hope that they fill in?

949
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,390
And then I thought, no, say something.

950
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,700
Say something out loud to them that
smooths the transition of you leaving.

951
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,900
Okay, what do I say? Pick a
thing to say. Goodbye.

952
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
That's a nightmare.
That's just...

953
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,890
Goodbye?

954
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:05,790
That's not even-- that's just noises.

955
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,800
Finally I walked away and
I said, "I'm leaving!"

956
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,390
I know it was that bad

957
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,800
because they all went, "Whoa.
Shit. Okay. Alright. Whoa."

958
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,600
I'll never see those people
again as long I live.

959
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,400
And then I had to get in the car.
I forgot that I had rented a car

960
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,590
and I have to drive back to the hotel.

961
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,600
And I'm driving on this highway in Missouri.

962
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,990
And at one point I realized,

963
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,490
I think it's been about 25 minutes

964
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,500
since I had looked out the
front window of this car.

965
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
I've just been dealing
with shit directly in--

966
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:56,490
Oh, shit.

967
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:58,390
There's a whole spectrum of
responsibility out here.

968
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,400
I'm supposed to take part in this.

969
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,800
And then at one point I remember
I was at a drive through,

970
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,990
and I was terrified.

971
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Because there's a lady sticking
her head out a window.

972
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,200
And she's mad. She's going, "Sir!"

973
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:18,090
"Sirrr!"

974
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,490
I just kept saying,
I don't know. I don't know.

975
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,190
I don't know!

976
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,200
I had the window closed.
I had no fucking idea.

977
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,300
What part of the transaction am I--?

978
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,890
Did I pay yet? Have I ordered?

979
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,900
Have I been sitting here for
40 minutes just eating

980
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:39,100
at the window, and I ate the
paper and everything?

981
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,490
"Sirrr!"

982
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,490
And I just went,
I don't know! I don't want it!

983
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,500
And I just fucking bolted.

984
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,400
So I can't do that anymore.

985
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,990
But you get older and some
things you can't do anymore.

986
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,490
Some things you don't
want to do anymore.

987
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,790
It's a nice change.

988
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,790
You feel some desires fall away.

989
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,690
New things make you happy.

990
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,490
But some things don't change
and some things I'm sick of.

991
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:09,990
Like the constant

992
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,090
just the constant

993
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,990
perverted, sexual thoughts.

994
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,490
I'm so tired of those.

995
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:18,800
Just the constant--

996
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,290
Suck it.

997
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:25,990
It just makes me into an idiot.

998
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,590
I'm jacking off to morons.

999
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,190
"Look at my tits."

1000
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,090
Yeah, your tits are awesome.

1001
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:34,100
It's just a dumb part of
life that I'm sick of.

1002
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:36,790
It's all day too.

1003
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,390
It's just--
You can't have a day.

1004
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,400
I just want to be a person in clothes
walking in a store and just--

1005
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,590
I just want to go to the
library and ask for--

1006
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,190
Hi, ma'am, is there-- I'm
looking for a book about

1007
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,990
early Abraham Lincoln,
like when he was--

1008
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,990
I wish I could wrap your hair
around my dick and--

1009
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,890
Oh, shit.

1010
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,690
I'm trying to talk to her!

1011
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,900
[sigh]

1012
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,090
That's really a male problem.

1013
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,900
It's really a male problem, not being able
to control your constant sexual impulse.

1014
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,590
Women try to compete.

1015
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,600
"Well, I'm a pervert. You don't know."

1016
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,890
"I have really sick sexual thoughts."

1017
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:16,490
No, you have no idea.

1018
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,500
You have no idea.

1019
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,890
See, you get to have those thoughts.

1020
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,900
I have to have them.

1021
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,090
You're a tourist in sexual perversion.

1022
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,890
I'm a prisoner there.

1023
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,690
You're Jane Fonda on a tank.

1024
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,590
I'm John McCain in the hut.

1025
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,990
It's a nightmare.

1026
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
I can't lift my arms.

1027
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,200
And for men, sex just is
such a constant thing.

1028
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,500
It's not even sex to us. It's just pussy.

1029
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,190
That's what we call it.

1030
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,790
Pussy... it has nothing to do with women.

1031
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,800
It's not about girls or chicks
like it was in the 50's.

1032
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,490
There's no guys anywhere
in the world saying,

1033
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,300
"Let's go meet some chicks and kiss them
on the mouth and see what happens."

1034
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,790
There's none of that.

1035
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:08,800
"Mmmm, I sure would like to
have my arm around a girl."

1036
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,890
"Mmmm, Vanessa, I love--"

1037
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:12,890
No, it's not.

1038
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,790
It's just

1039
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,190
pussy.

1040
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:16,990
Pussy.

1041
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
It's not even a pussy.

1042
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
It's not some peoples' pussies.

1043
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,490
It's just pussy.

1044
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,500
Like big pink balloon letters in
front of our faces all the time.

1045
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,700
To men it's just an
element of the universe,

1046
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
like it should be on the
chart of the elements

1047
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,500
next to tin and ammonia.

1048
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:51,000
P-y with an atomic weight of 12
or whatever pussy atoms weigh.

1049
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,300
The sad thing is that for all our obsession
about sex and how much we love it,

1050
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,690
we suck at it.

1051
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,290
Men are terrible at sex.

1052
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:05,300
It never even occurs to us to do it well.

1053
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,990
Women just make sex great.

1054
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,390
Women are the good part of sex.

1055
00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:11,390
They accept the dick with grace

1056
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,490
and they turn it into art.

1057
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:16,390
Or they climb on and they ride.

1058
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,990
They go for a ride.

1059
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Men don't. We just climb on.

1060
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
[grunting]

1061
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:30,590
I'm putting my dick in you.

1062
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,090
Put it in.

1063
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,290
Shove it in.

1064
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,300
Shove it.

1065
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,690
[grunting]

1066
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:39,990
You ever fuck when you're out of shape?

1067
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,000
You're like, "Ugh, shit. This is--"

1068
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,500
My stomach muscles are not strong.

1069
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,300
[grunting]

1070
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,190
We're so bad at sex

1071
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,700
and then we wonder why women
aren't really aggressive about sex.

1072
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:03,990
We think it's because they don't
have as much desire as we do.

1073
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,290
That's how stupid men are.

1074
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:09,290
We think they're just weird.

1075
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,590
"Women are fucked up in the head,

1076
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,090
because they don't want to
just fuck all the time."

1077
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,100
"If I was a women, I'd
just fuck everybody."

1078
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,690
"Why don't they want to
fuck all the time? I do."

1079
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:23,000
Of course you do, because when
you fuck, you get to fuck a woman.

1080
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,800
When she fucks, she has to fuck a guy.

1081
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,490
Wildly different experience.

1082
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:39,500
For a man, 100% of the time
he's fucking a woman

1083
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,800
it's the greatest thing that ever
happened in his entire life.

1084
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,990
For a woman, about 40% of the time she's
being fucked by a guy she's thinking,

1085
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
"I'll get over this in a week.
It's not the worst thing."

1086
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,500
"I'm not going to cry this time."

1087
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:02,500
Another thing that proves how bad men
are at sex is that after sex you're
looking at two very different people.

1088
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:07,600
The man just wants to lay there
and be cool and the woman
wants to cuddle.

1089
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,190
It's something that men love
to make fun of women for.

1090
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,790
"They always want to cuddle.
It's so needy."

1091
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,490
"I already fucked you.
Just let me watch the game."

1092
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,090
"I'm so cool."

1093
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,190
"What are you thinking about?"

1094
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,200
"Shut up. Leave me alone."

1095
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,690
"Why is she so needy?"

1096
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,290
She's not needy, you idiot.

1097
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:30,300
She's horny, because you
did nothing for her.

1098
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:33,800
You did absolutely nothing.

1099
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,200
Her pussy is on fire

1100
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,400
because it's gone unfucked completely.

1101
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:44,190
Of course you're fine, because
you climbed on and went--

1102
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,490
and then rolled off.

1103
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,890
And she's on you because she's going,

1104
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,900
"What the--? Something
else has to happen!"

1105
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,600
"This is bullshit!"

1106
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,000
If you fuck a woman well
she will leave you alone.

1107
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:05,100
"Thanks a lot, buddy."
[snoring]

1108
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,300
Thanks a lot, folks.
I hope you enjoyed the show.

1109
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,790
You guys were great.
Thank you very very much.

1110
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,100
Good night.

1111
01:01:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
