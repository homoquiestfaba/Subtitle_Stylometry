00:00:12,375 --> 00:00:19,540
This film is dedicated to my father
late Sri Gottimukkala Narasimharaju

2
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,540
for inspring me to make this film.

3
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,374
Sir has come.
- Come.

4
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:25,582
Welcome to the seventh
anniversary of this school,

5
00:01:25,833 --> 00:01:32,624
today's specialty is chief guest
industrialist Mangalampalli Maharadhi,

6
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:38,499
another specialty is his
generous donation to this school.

7
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:43,040
Let's watch first cultural program
as the part of this function.

8
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:49,665
Hello doctor, missed my heart...

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,790
Pulse is racing...

10
00:01:58,958 --> 00:02:08,915
College is fighting...

11
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:13,415
What happened sir?

12
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:15,957
You mustn't call me now,
call ambulance.

13
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:17,082
Why sir?

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,624
lt seems he has missed
his heart and pulse.

15
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:21,707
Take care of him first.

16
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:24,415
You're too much sir!
lt's latest hit song, sir.

17
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:25,374
So what?

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,082
ln school programs you must ask
children to sing patriotic songs.

19
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,124
No sir, the boy wanted to...
- Will you encourage him?

20
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,582
What's his age?
What's meaning of that song?

21
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,624
What's this sir? You're blowing up
a trivial issue, sir.

22
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,124
This is not trivial issue
but children's issue.

23
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,915
l hate indiscipline in children.

24
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:45,540
This generation is like that sir,
your son would also be like this only.

25
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,749
No way!
Because, l've a daughter only

26
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:56,624
Okay, you do have a daughter
if not a son, right?

27
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,249
You'll have a son-in-law, right?
He'll be of this modern generation.

28
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,790
Think over it sir.

29
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,207
Go!

30
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,582
You bought that horse doll for
your daughter to play, right?

31
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,707
ls it necessary to carry her
on your back?

32
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:53,499
Bought a doll for her happiness,
l'm doubly happy to play with her.

33
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,915
What is baby doing?
- She's angry.

34
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,915
Why?
- She wants a cycle now.

35
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,499
Daddy is busy, l'll talk to him
after he comes home.

36
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,165
We're shifting the house
immediately, pack up the things.

37
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,540
l'm sending men.
- That is...

38
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,124
That's it!

39
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:16,624
Why shifting house suddenly?

40
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:21,165
Buying a cycle which my
daughter asks is happiness,

41
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,082
giving a big house with space to
ride cycle is double happiness.

42
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,040
But Susheela...
- Daddy...- Yes dear!

43
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:30,874
We're going to science exhibition
in school, daddy.

44
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,124
May l also join them, daddy?

45
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,749
You must go dear.
How can you miss it?

46
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:38,124
Children, stay together.

47
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,624
l'll show them around.
Look, how the ball is going up!

48
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,749
lt goes...goes up...and then...

49
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,582
All of you get on the bridge.

50
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,832
Did your teachers show you
the science exhibition?

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,415
No, daddy took me around and
explained everything, mummy.

52
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:08,624
Daddy?

53
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,540
You said you've an important
meeting, right?

54
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,540
Was it in science exhibition?

55
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,915
Why did you send her
if you want to follow her??

56
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,665
She asked may l?
l gave her permission.

57
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,124
l'm happy as a father.

58
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,207
l went there as friendly companion.

59
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:24,290
What's this madness?

60
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,915
l want to give always double
happiness to my daughter,

61
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,707
l don't mind if you take it
as love or madness.

62
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:32,832
But to me, my Lovely is my life!

63
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:46,707
Just introduce him,
l'll rip him off!

64
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,915
Brother, that's his bike.

65
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:52,457
Where is he?

66
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:57,582
What's that?
- Gems, brother.

67
00:07:57,791 --> 00:08:00,457
You mean...?
- That which kids eat.

68
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:04,540
l too buy it everyday for my kid.
- That's it, brother.

69
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:07,290
ls it? The man who beat you,
what's he doing here?

70
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,165
He too is a boy, right?
He would've beaten him up.

71
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:11,957
ls it? What are those things?

72
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,999
Eating these chocolates
will turn them like that.

73
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,165
He's right, brother.

74
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:17,415
Would he also be like that?

75
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,415
He's just a kid, brother!

76
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:24,332
Just use mild force and
he'd come to knees.

77
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,790
l was drunk then if not l would've
broken his bones myself.

78
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:40,957
Where is he?

79
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,415
Did you call me early morning
to beat him or to stand here?

80
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,915
Wait, brother!
You don't need to go,

81
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,499
l'll break his limbs and
bring his body.

82
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,040
Brother...brother...

83
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,582
Why did you beat my boy?

84
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,374
l didn't beat him brother,
just pushed him, that's all.

85
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:35,624
What about this man?
You beat him, right?

86
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,207
That was also not beating, brother.

87
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,499
Just casually patted him, that's all.

88
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,957
Didn't he tell you what had
happened before that?

89
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,749
He says something happened
before, what's that?

90
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,665
Before that...

91
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:50,124
He sang a fantastic song, brother.

92
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,624
Song?

93
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:14,457
Do it with your heart!

94
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:18,832
Join the fun, leave hesitation...

95
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,707
Have a blast!

96
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:26,499
l'm a prince at any cost...
A brute force...

97
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:29,999
Rock the kingdom...

98
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:39,415
What ever you're doing,
enjoy and have fun in it...

99
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:48,540
My heart is swinging...
My heart says...

100
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:21,040
lt's lnternet times and
home have become an atlas...

101
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,499
Social networking has
become friend offriendship...

102
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,999
Unlimited freedom has
wiped out all the boundaries...

103
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,790
Teenage is racing thrice
the speed of 3G...

104
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,624
Forget the past...
New world...have a blast...

105
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:48,207
Do whatever has to be done now...

106
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:44,957
Mind and heart are refreshed
in an angle...

107
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:49,790
We relax in crazy discotheques...

108
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,999
There's nothing wrong in
sporting trendy outfits...

109
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,749
We'll change into new colours
like butterflies...

110
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,790
Young age...

111
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,499
Volume is high...

112
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,582
Youth is like this...

113
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:15,207
Happy days are ours without
any season or reason...

114
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,082
So, that's the matter.

115
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,124
l don't know the girl he
had teased yesterday,

116
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,540
But he got a stick.

117
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:48,957
A girl is waiting for me there.

118
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,499
l think you've understood
the matter.

119
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,582
Why did you let him go, brother?
Break his bones! He's going!

120
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,040
Will you beat then?

121
00:14:07,625 --> 00:14:09,540
lf l beat that will be the effect!

122
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:13,124
Did l beat you?
Tell your brother.

123
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,957
We thought he's a kid but
he came, he beat and left.

124
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,124
Would anyone respect us now?

125
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,040
No use to come with a gang
to beat one man,

126
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:58,124
you must inquire few people
how would that person beat.

127
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,665
You're getting fired and
l'm getting a call.

128
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,707
l'm waiting here.
- l'm fighting here.

129
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,040
l'm coming, wait.

130
00:15:31,291 --> 00:15:33,957
Brother, don't have time
to play one day,

131
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,332
let's play speed game of T20!

132
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,665
lf you want to beat anyone, plan it in
city outskirts or in darkness,

133
00:15:55,875 --> 00:16:00,249
you mustn't wait for people coming
out from gyms after a warm up.

134
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,874
Oh no! He saw me.

135
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,249
Brother!

136
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:10,749
You got beaten up yesterday,
you could've remained silent,

137
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,540
do you've to get your brother
and his men beaten up by me?

138
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,624
l thought he would bash you,

139
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,124
how would l know he's just
a show off and has no guts?

140
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:28,082
Why are you so late?

141
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:31,915
lt's great l'm here,
a gang had a plan for me.

142
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,457
Can't your day pass off
without a fight or trouble?

143
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:38,957
Only when young men like me get
attacked like this often, we'll be alert.

144
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:43,415
They do exercise, if not they'll lose
interest and girth will increase.

145
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,582
What's the program?
What's the plan?

146
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:46,915
My foot plan!

147
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,957
Coffee shops, multiplexes
or theme parks,

148
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,249
where ever you go,
its holes to the pocket.

149
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,832
Where are you taking me then?
- Nowhere!

150
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:57,165
Get on my bike,
sit cutely and talk to me,

151
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:01,374
let's go around on bike
and enjoy!

152
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:12,999
My daddy!
- ls it? Did he see us?

153
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,999
Yes, he saw us.
- Then, okay.

154
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,665
That's my daughter, right?
- Yes sir.

155
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:22,290
l'll take care of my daughter,
you get the details about him.

156
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,457
Okay sir.

157
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,457
l hate to study college book.

158
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:34,124
l'm here on personal work,
you take care of the bunk.

159
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,540
Do you know who am l?

160
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,957
Your face isn't that glowing
but heavy gold on you is shining!

161
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,165
You're wealthy!

162
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,207
You're very speed!

163
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:54,165
You know it, that's why you trapped
Bunk Babu Rao's daughter Anjali.

164
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,249
Are you Anjali's father?

165
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,165
l don't know why uncle,
l'm always lucky.

166
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,957
Your coffee sir.

167
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,957
What's this?
- Madras filter coffee, sir.

168
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,249
My range is no more of having
Madras ginger coffee,

169
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,207
take it back and bring the
costliest coffee in your shop.

170
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:17,124
Boys can drink anything but
sons-in-law mustn't have cheap drinks.

171
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:18,874
Uncles will feel bad.

172
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,290
l'm not here to give
my daughter to you,

173
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:24,749
l'm here to warn you.

174
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,415
You don't know about
my generation, uncle.

175
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:30,957
We're lazy to prepare
for exam or interview,

176
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:34,957
but we're fully prepared for any
eventuality regarding girls.

177
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,040
You can threaten or warn
as much as you can.

178
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,415
So, warnings will not stop you.
What about money?

179
00:18:40,666 --> 00:18:45,624
How dare you ask that, uncle?
Are lovers lPL players to buy?

180
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,790
ls love a newly released film
to do piracy?

181
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,957
Love! l know the speed
of this matter.

182
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:58,082
l didn't put price on it,
l'm putting price on you.

183
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:01,957
Tell me how much you want?
- Please give Rs.450, sir.

184
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,790
ls it enough?

185
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,957
Mine is 100 days love story,

186
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:10,332
paying forjust one coffee will not do,
pay at least for 100 coffees.

187
00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,040
100 coffees...
your price is Rs.45000!

188
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,499
That's for coffee only,
what about tips to the waiter?

189
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,415
Don't narrate tales,
tell me how much?

190
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,124
l like your straight talk, uncle.

191
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,082
For my ground work, pay Rs.50000!

192
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:28,665
l didn't know he's so foolish,
l withdrew 5 lakhs from bank.

193
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:36,707
Let's end our discussion now,
let's execute our coffee shop deal!

194
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,874
Bye!

195
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,582
l told you this plan will work out.

196
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,207
You will say anything,

197
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,540
your dad was there with cash,
we were successful.

198
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,040
Had he come with a gang,
l would've got finished!

199
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:57,124
Money...money...people are
becoming commercial!

200
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:57,957
Take it!

201
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,540
Rs.20000 your father gave me.

202
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,957
My dad never gives me money
but spends heavily for me.

203
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,999
Because my dad loves me very much.
- No, stop that bore.

204
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,999
l hate this father and
daughter sentiment.

205
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,999
Why?
- Why? Every daughter, like you,

206
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,624
if father does this much,
you feel has done so much.

207
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:19,415
Why are you jealous?
You've cashed the relationship, right?

208
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:23,082
No need of thanks, just give me
my share, that's enough.

209
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:25,415
You'll never change!

210
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:30,499
We can change notes and
cheques easily but not mindset.

211
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,915
lf you really love a girl,
would you behave like this?

212
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:40,499
Will you leave her
if her dad pays you?

213
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,790
No way!
How do l look like to you?

214
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,749
l thought you'd do the same!

215
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,749
l didn't say no way about
my lover, but about love!

216
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,457
lt'll not suit me.
- Why?

217
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:55,290
Why? Once they used to tell
1000 lies to conduct a marriage,

218
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,832
but one has to tell a lakh lies to
make a girl fall in love with him.

219
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:00,415
l don't have that much of patience.

220
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,957
Experience?
Should we've do it ourselves for it?

221
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,832
Can't l get it from some fool?

222
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,374
Fool brings to my memory...

223
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,040
l've a friend.

224
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,665
My hobbies are...

225
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,832
Dating means...

226
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:21,790
lt's an emotion got after
4 or 5 stages of chattings,

227
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,165
but in that stage...

228
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,874
Great dedication and hard work
is compulsory!

229
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,290
To say it simply!

230
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:31,540
You don't need the swiftness
of a squirrel catcher.

231
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,457
All you need is the
patience of an angler.

232
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:38,165
Sometimes even after long wait
you may not catch a fish.

233
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:41,624
Sometimes you may try hard
but can't trap a girl in a month.

234
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:42,957
Then...

235
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,665
Stop eating!

236
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,499
Stop sleeping too!

237
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,582
Stop what ever you get!
control it.

238
00:22:02,416 --> 00:22:03,957
l like you!

239
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,457
My sweetheart is online.

240
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,999
The only woman you like!

241
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:10,624
Mother Teresa!

242
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,582
What's your opinion on cruelty
towards animals?

243
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,707
ln my opinion it's a grave sin.

244
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:25,332
l hate alcohol.

245
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:27,915
l'm getting reply.

246
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:31,374
Whether it is cinema theatre
or Singapore flight,

247
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:34,665
l'll never buy single ticket,
l want three tickets.

248
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:38,624
l hate anyone sitting next to me.
except you.

249
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,540
Why is the home so peaceful?
- Mummy and daddy have gone out.

250
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,957
You enjoy, l'll also go out.

251
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,040
Will you walk?

252
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,415
l've bike, right?
- But it's not there now.

253
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:02,790
Did your mother take it so quickly?
- She took my dad too.

254
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,249
To beauty parlour.

255
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,124
Did your dad tailed your mother?

256
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:11,165
Mummy took him by hair
for company, uncle

257
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,415
Go slow...slow...

258
00:23:17,666 --> 00:23:20,040
l'll stop the bike, you ride it.
- l didn't mean that.

259
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:23,124
People who can't drive
must sit silently.

260
00:23:23,666 --> 00:23:24,582
Don't give directions.

261
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,124
Why don't you go alone?
Why did you bring me also?

262
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:31,415
When l catch this handle,
l need hands to carry luggage.

263
00:23:31,625 --> 00:23:33,957
Are you using me like a carry bag?

264
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,790
Hey, you're entering from wrong side.

265
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,790
Stop!
- l'm riding, right?

266
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,790
Why are you entering from wrong side?

267
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,499
Don't you've shame?
Allowing women to drive on main road.

268
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,457
Can't you drive?

269
00:23:45,708 --> 00:23:47,332
Didn't hit you, right?
Why are you lecturing? Go!

270
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:48,207
Start your auto.

271
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:49,832
My fate!

272
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,249
Thanks! You don't let anyone
abuse me.

273
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:56,290
Yes, l've the right to abuse you,
l'll not let others do it.

274
00:23:56,791 --> 00:23:57,832
Will you stop?

275
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,082
Mom's back.

276
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:00,790
l got a call.

277
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,124
What did you bring for me, mummy?

278
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,665
l brought your father safely to home.

279
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:08,415
l've brought video game for you.

280
00:24:09,125 --> 00:24:10,832
What's the matter?
You're very happy.

281
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:13,249
Who is it? Kittu?
- Yes sister-in-law.

282
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,499
My facebook girl friend
is meeting me.

283
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:19,457
May be she likes taking risks.

284
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,207
Sister-in-law again.
- l can hear it.

285
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,290
Okay, who is she?
Where are you meeting her?

286
00:24:23,541 --> 00:24:25,082
l think l'll meet her in coffee shop.

287
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,832
You don't have the range to
meet in a 5 star hotel.

288
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:29,915
Sister-in-law loves me so much.

289
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:32,999
As ifyou're Shahrukh Khan
and l'm your die hard fan.

290
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,374
Cool sister-in-law.

291
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:37,415
l struggled hard and
brought her to my line,

292
00:24:37,666 --> 00:24:40,832
if l se her up, l'll not have
to worry about lover.

293
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:42,665
Poor girl's bad time starts now.

294
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,874
Sister-in-law!
- What's it, Kittappa?

295
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:46,207
Call me Kittu, sister-in-law?

296
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:49,957
You've changed the name stylishly
but what can you do with that face?

297
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:51,624
When you're before anyone,

298
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,957
it's like watching
Planet ofApes film.

299
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,624
Akash, enough of this torture.
l'm cutting the call.

300
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,790
Hey Kasi!

301
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:17,832
What's this hurry?

302
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,874
l think that's your daughter.

303
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,499
At times leaving children you
love and come this far,

304
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:29,207
isn't it like leaving your life?

305
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,415
Why are you living alone here?

306
00:25:32,625 --> 00:25:34,832
You should've brought your family too.

307
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,332
Coming here is my necessity.

308
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:39,540
My daughter likes to stay there.

309
00:25:39,791 --> 00:25:41,999
l can't deny my daughter's wish
for my necessity.

310
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,415
My daughter too,

311
00:25:43,666 --> 00:25:45,957
l don't know how she is and
when she would come here?

312
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:49,832
Fathers with grown up daughters
living away can't avoid this tension.

313
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:54,415
Look Kasi, we can feel sad for
daughters not staying with us,

314
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:58,707
but l don't have tension about her,
because...

315
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,124
She'll never do anything
without telling me.

316
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,457
She'll not take a step
without my knowledge.

317
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:06,957
We think like that but
on getting certain age,

318
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:10,540
children forget everything
we had done for them.

319
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:12,249
lnfact they don't need us at all.

320
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,540
But l've not raised my Lovely
like a father but like me.

321
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,415
l've written diary about how my daughter
must grow from her childhood.

322
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:22,999
Surprisingly she was just like that!

323
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,457
l was very happy.

324
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,290
l may be not with her now,

325
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:33,540
but my diary is always with her,
and make her think like me.

326
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:37,165
Poor man has great hope on her!

327
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:41,540
Any father with daughter
must think like this.

328
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:44,624
lf not life will be miserable.
lt seems it happened as in diary,

329
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:45,999
though they may read
umpteen number of diaries,

330
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,207
there are rogues who can
change their direction is a moment.

331
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,790
His daughter too is a girl, right?

332
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,540
At some point she too can't
avoid changing the direction.

333
00:26:55,375 --> 00:27:00,124
She can't avoid turning from
daddy's path to a cheat's way.

334
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:05,290
What a beauty!

335
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,749
Why is she so beautiful?
Seeing her has changed my mindset.

336
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,082
Two wheelers that side sir.
- Not here for petrol but to ogle.

337
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,165
How many litres?
- Fill the tank.

338
00:27:52,625 --> 00:27:56,249
Why haven't you turned it to zero?
- l didn't see it, madam.

339
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:58,290
This is the chance, go after him.

340
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,415
Didn't see it?
What if she too had not seen it?

341
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:03,582
You'd have cheated her for Rs.500!

342
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,957
No sir.
- What no?

343
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:08,457
Since she's sitting in the car,
you thought se won't see it.

344
00:28:08,708 --> 00:28:10,249
No sir.
- What no?

345
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,707
You're confident that she won't
get down from car, right?

346
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,749
lt happened by mistake sir.

347
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,457
l'm giving her so many hints
but she's getting down from car.

348
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:22,957
Don't talk, this is 500% cheating.

349
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:26,165
Not like this, take out your lD card.

350
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:27,915
We don't have lD cards, sir.

351
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,332
Then give me your license.
- l don't own any vehicle.

352
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,040
That's the matter.

353
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:36,290
Since you don't have a vehicle,
you've decided to cheat car owners.

354
00:28:36,541 --> 00:28:38,540
Take out you insurance.
- l don't have insurance too.

355
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,749
Please leave me sir.
- He says sorry, leave him.

356
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,749
You keep quiet sir.

357
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,332
ls he here to fill petrol
or to cheat people?

358
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:46,040
Would you keep quiet
if she was your sister?

359
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,165
By the way whose sister
is the girl in car?

360
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:49,207
Your sister, brother-in-law.

361
00:28:49,458 --> 00:28:51,624
Come, l'll get her to
tie a rakhi. Come.

362
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:57,082
Take out your ration card, Aadhar card,
gas card, every card you have.

363
00:28:57,333 --> 00:28:58,915
l'll see that you don't
get any card.

364
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:02,499
Please tell him, madam.
- Please leave him.

365
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:04,499
He's requesting you, right?

366
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,624
You're working out well.

367
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,290
Situation was in my favour.

368
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,624
Are you always on this job
all the 24 hours?

369
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,957
ls it you?

370
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,707
Getting phone calls.

371
00:29:30,458 --> 00:29:32,165
My nerves are cracking.

372
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,040
ls it she?

373
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:01,957
What to do?

374
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:05,790
Tell me Kittu.

375
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,665
Buddy, where ever you're, come to
Madhapur restaurant immediately.

376
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:10,957
Okay, l'll come.

377
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:22,082
Stuck in traffic?

378
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:24,874
Have you come Akash?

379
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,624
Why are you rushing and wearing
helmet like a chain snatcher?

380
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:29,957
l'm in trouble.

381
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:31,165
Stop nonsense and
tell me the matter.

382
00:30:31,416 --> 00:30:33,332
My facebook girl friend is here.
- Talk to her then.

383
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:34,874
l can't go to her.

384
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:38,415
l came to know that facebook means
people who can't show faces.

385
00:30:38,666 --> 00:30:40,790
What happened?
- l'll tell you.

386
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,040
lt was the time of
Pawan Kalyan's film 'Teen Maar'!

387
00:30:54,958 --> 00:30:58,165
When we get fever, mother...

388
00:31:00,083 --> 00:31:01,999
When we get fever,
we feel mother should be with us,

389
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,290
when we get scared,
we feel dad should be with us,

390
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:07,707
when we are sad, we feel
a friend should be with us,

391
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:11,707
but only when we are happy,
only when we're happy,

392
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,165
we feel the girl we love
must be with us.

393
00:31:13,375 --> 00:31:15,957
lf you talk like this, l feel
police should be with us now.

394
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,207
l was singing about
she ringing my heart,

395
00:31:18,458 --> 00:31:20,790
but she suddenly hit
my heart with bell and left.

396
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,540
That's all? Just say something
and manage her.- You stop.

397
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:26,124
Ram Gopal Varma's 'Raktha Charithra'
ended with two parts,

398
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:28,707
but my senseless history
has two more parts.

399
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:30,207
What else?

400
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:33,082
l was just recovering from the
wounds of 'Teen Maar' days,

401
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,124
Prince Mahesh Babu's
'Dookudu' film released.

402
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:42,290
Thursday march 1st evening
5.40 pm, l saw for the first time...

403
00:31:42,291 --> 00:31:44,040
Today isn't Thursday!

404
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,082
lt's not March 1st!
December 7th!

405
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,415
lt's not evening 5.40 pm too.

406
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:51,124
Really your history is senseless.

407
00:31:51,375 --> 00:31:53,207
What would say after
hearing the climax?

408
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:55,290
What did you do this time?

409
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,707
l saw NTR's 'Oosaravelli'.
l planned a friendship.

410
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:08,249
Love means caring...
friend means sharing...

411
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:12,957
How is my framing?

412
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,207
Friendship?

413
00:32:15,458 --> 00:32:16,832
O my friend?

414
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:20,540
l want you only!
- Have you seen your face in the mirror?

415
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,874
You're like a bull and
if you feel insulted,

416
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:29,165
when you imitate those heroes,
how would those heroes feel?

417
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:30,415
What would become of their fans?

418
00:32:30,666 --> 00:32:32,582
lf you hurt me like this,
what would become of me?

419
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:35,207
l had decided never to
enter her life again.

420
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:37,540
But didn't expect she
would chat with me.

421
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,707
Didn't you see your faces even
after chatting for so many days?

422
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:43,040
She had a photo of
Sania Mirza in her profile.

423
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,707
l too had brilliant idea and
used Shoaib's photo.

424
00:32:45,958 --> 00:32:46,915
You fool!

425
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:49,665
She'll also say the same if l go inside.
- lsn't it?

426
00:32:49,916 --> 00:32:51,332
lt'll not work out, come let's go.

427
00:32:51,583 --> 00:32:54,457
Please try to understand,
l'm lucky to get such a girl.

428
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:55,624
What would you do now?

429
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:58,040
You've to do not me.
- Me?

430
00:32:58,291 --> 00:32:59,874
lf she sees me now,

431
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:03,332
she should be like Darling Kajol but
would become Anushka Arundhati.

432
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:05,040
so...
- So?

433
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,290
You meet her in my place.
- After you get close,

434
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,082
how sweet l am, how great it
is to get a lover like me,

435
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:11,165
you tell her and set her for me.

436
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,207
Please buddy,
l'll die and be born as your child.

437
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:15,249
Are you requesting
with death threat?

438
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,749
Are you threatening to
be born as my son?

439
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,124
Take it as you wish, please go.

440
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:19,165
Your fate!

441
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:20,999
Who is the girl?

442
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,790
lt's her! Go!

443
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:07,165
Just now in the petrol bunk...

444
00:34:11,041 --> 00:34:14,665
l too felt like scolding him
but controlled myself.

445
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:18,457
You ripped him apart.
He got real stick!

446
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,540
No problem, we can say
what ever we feel like.

447
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:24,707
Don't control everything.

448
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,374
What else?

449
00:34:40,541 --> 00:34:44,332
Do you play tennis?
- l don't even watch it.

450
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:48,207
ls it? Then, why do you keep
Sania Mirza's photo in your profile?

451
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:50,374
l didn't know which photo
to keep there.

452
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:52,040
Did you use it because
she's beautiful?

453
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,374
But to me, you look more
beautiful than her.

454
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:02,790
l think Lovely name suits
you better than Lalli.

455
00:35:11,291 --> 00:35:12,124
ln the petrol bunk a while ago...

456
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:13,499
lf you want to give me a treat for it,

457
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,124
l'll encourage him to
cheat you everyday.

458
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:21,082
Now we're friends but you helped
then without knowing me,

459
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,040
this treat is for that.

460
00:35:22,291 --> 00:35:26,499
lsn't it great to react like
that for strangers?

461
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,749
What's so great in it?

462
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,540
lt's happiness to do
for our people.

463
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:32,415
lt's double happiness to think
all are our people.

464
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,290
Doubted him unnecessarily.

465
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:43,707
You know my dad, right?

466
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:45,915
lf he comes to know l'm chatting,

467
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:48,707
he'll break legs of my
computer instructor.

468
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:52,790
lf he come to know about meeting,
he'll start hacking!

469
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,749
Why did you send me then?

470
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,790
l've chatted with many people.

471
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,290
But don't know why l felt
this idiot was better.

472
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,540
There's nothing to lose in
meeting, right? So l met him.

473
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:07,749
By the way how is my boy friend?

474
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,832
ls he fair like Mahesh Babu?
Fair complexion.

475
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:12,582
Tall like Prabhas?

476
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:14,457
Taller than you.

477
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:16,582
Does he have good body like Allu Arjun?

478
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:18,832
l think he would've six pack
behind that shirt.

479
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:22,165
l'm feeling strange hearing
about him from you.

480
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:23,624
Don't you've shame?

481
00:36:23,875 --> 00:36:25,874
Forget it, do we need it?

482
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,415
Please tell more about him.

483
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:28,999
What's there to tell about him?

484
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:33,874
l think he would be really great
to get such certificate from you.

485
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:37,457
l'll dare now!
- But there's a risk.

486
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:39,457
l told you about the
petrol bunk incident, right?

487
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:44,415
Though he didn't knew me,
he created a scene for cheating me.

488
00:36:44,625 --> 00:36:48,915
So?- He's so sincere, if he come
to know we had cheated him.

489
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,124
l'll see that you don't
have any card.

490
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,957
Without a doubt,
he would tear our cards.

491
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,165
What to do now?

492
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:58,665
l don't know, better to meet
him at an opportune time.

493
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:00,582
You deal with him.

494
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:03,290
Ever since you told me about him,
l can't hold myself.

495
00:37:03,541 --> 00:37:05,207
lf you unite us quickly and
if we've a daughter,

496
00:37:05,458 --> 00:37:09,332
l'll name her as Lavanya after you.
- What if you've a son?

497
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:12,957
l'll name him as Lavangam.

498
00:37:15,416 --> 00:37:16,915
How can l help you sir?

499
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,957
You've shirts with changing
colours, right? Show me.

500
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:22,040
We don't have shirts like that, sir.

501
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:25,249
No? You gave me one yesterday.
Run out of stock already?

502
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,374
l don't know what you're saying, sir?

503
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:30,415
We too don't know
what colour this shirt is?

504
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:34,582
Enough of seeing it,
tell me what colour is that?

505
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,499
l too felt like that.

506
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,790
When l went out and saw,
it's true colour was out.

507
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,499
What happened sir?
- What happened?

508
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:44,957
lt appears in a colour here,
it's a different colour outside.

509
00:37:45,125 --> 00:37:46,457
This is also a type of
cheating, you know?

510
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:48,957
Take out your ration card, Aadhar card,
gas card, every card you have.

511
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,665
Same voice and same words.

512
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:52,540
Let's decide it between us now.
Take out.

513
00:37:54,416 --> 00:37:56,707
Lights are switched on in
cricket stadiums at night only,

514
00:37:56,958 --> 00:38:00,832
but will you switch on lights
all the day and cheat people?

515
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,665
Take out...

516
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:05,249
Take out you RC, insurance
and license.

517
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,582
Take out everything.

518
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:07,832
l'm the floor Manager, sir.

519
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,082
Please tell me,
what's your problem, sir?

520
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,915
l'll solve it.
- Should l begin from the start?

521
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:15,082
Do one thing, get your staff
to form a queue,

522
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:17,249
l'll tell every one of them.

523
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:21,499
Why are you watching like a fool?

524
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,624
Tell him.

525
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,624
Why are you staring me?
Mind your work.

526
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:29,957
Half of the people come here to
pass time or try new clothes.

527
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:30,874
Am l right?

528
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:33,624
Sir, here's the blue shirt you wanted.

529
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:34,999
What's the guaranty that this is blue?

530
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,374
Do one thing, switch off the lights,

531
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:41,874
using natural light,
l'll check the colour and decide.

532
00:38:48,333 --> 00:38:49,082
lfwe get a customer like
him every day,

533
00:38:49,291 --> 00:38:50,957
our showroom would
become a store room.

534
00:39:02,833 --> 00:39:04,249
What a beautiful girl!

535
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,040
My mind went blank for
that lovely smile.

536
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,290
You're talking about my lover,
don't forget it.

537
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,832
l know that's why l'm talking decently.

538
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:17,624
lf l tell all my feelings...
- Please don't tell, l beg you.

539
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:18,915
You should've seen the action,

540
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:22,290
he took on the showroom for
a slight change in colour.

541
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:24,957
So what?
Don't you wan to tell about us?

542
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,582
l don't know how to tell him?

543
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:29,790
He's going after anyone
for cheating.

544
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,290
lf he comes to know about us,
l'm sure he'll take us to task.

545
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,540
l've fallen flat for her.

546
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:35,874
l was always away from girls,

547
00:39:36,083 --> 00:39:42,915
l can't bear even inches
away from Lovely.

548
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:46,457
You're talking Lovely and distance.

549
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:52,499
Why such a girl is searching
for boy friend in Facebook?

550
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:57,332
Facebook is for people without
face value, why does she need it?

551
00:39:57,541 --> 00:40:01,332
lnstead of falling for dynamic
and dashing boy like me,

552
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:04,290
how could she fall for
a King Kong like you.

553
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,499
Just a joke.

554
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,874
lt's shocking to me also,
how did he fall for you?

555
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:11,874
He created a big scene
for a shirt colour,

556
00:40:12,083 --> 00:40:14,749
how could he keep quiet
without knowing about you?

557
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:20,249
Why are you jealous of me?

558
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:21,624
You'll also find someone.

559
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:22,790
Forget about me.

560
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,790
lf he come to know your cheating,
it's tears all the way.

561
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:31,999
So don't delay and
try convincing him quickly.

562
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,165
lf l delay l think
he'll elope with her.

563
00:40:41,458 --> 00:40:45,207
What are you doing?
- Chatting in messages too.

564
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:47,957
Just show me the way,
l'll pave a road.

565
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:50,874
He's asking, shall we meet?

566
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:54,540
Lovely? Tell him to call me Lalli.

567
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,415
ls she asking me to call her?

568
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:17,249
l've asked him to meet and he wants
to exchange phone numbers.

569
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:17,999
Take it easy.

570
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:22,040
lf l give him my number,
he'll find out the voice difference.

571
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:24,040
That's why l'm giving your number.

572
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:27,832
Leave me.
- No please.

573
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,124
She gave her number.

574
00:41:30,375 --> 00:41:31,207
Where shall we meet?

575
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:46,082
Our favourite spot.

576
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:50,124
But you must come in
my favourite colour dress.

577
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,999
She says your favourite spot.
- What's it?

578
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,540
You don't even have a passport.
ls Switzerland your favourite spot?

579
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:04,415
What's the local spot?

580
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:07,582
ldiot!

581
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:09,999
lt's not favourite
if you think and tell.

582
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:13,665
l know.
Each girl chats differently.

583
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:15,165
Brilliant guys like me...

584
00:42:15,416 --> 00:42:16,999
Commit themselves with
what ever they say.

585
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:20,249
What did we say then...

586
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:22,749
What could be his favourite colour?

587
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,582
He has put me in a spot.

588
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,082
Will you wear this?

589
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,082
Wear this, he'll not care
about colour.

590
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,415
Great!

591
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,874
Did you see her dress?

592
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:55,915
l gave all my used saris
to maid servant.

593
00:42:56,125 --> 00:42:59,957
lf l had made dress using old saris
it would be good dress, right?

594
00:43:02,166 --> 00:43:06,457
What's this? lt's embarrassing
to stand here in this dress.

595
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:18,540
She's not in the Necklace road.
- ls it? Great!

596
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:19,499
What's great?

597
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:22,582
lf she's not in one of the 3 places,
you're left with 2 places, right?

598
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,499
Sir Einstein!
Sanghi temple and Gandipet!

599
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,165
One is in east and
the other is in west.

600
00:43:27,375 --> 00:43:29,915
According to my calculation of
the kidney, you'd be in south, right?

601
00:43:30,125 --> 00:43:32,832
You wait in the north for me.
- Why?

602
00:43:33,041 --> 00:43:35,749
To bury you in the cemetery there.

603
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,165
Where did you buy this dress?

604
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:43,499
So, at last someone liked
this dress.

605
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:46,790
My sister too is going to college,

606
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,915
if l send her in such clothes,
nobody would bother her, right?

607
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:54,457
Hey idiot! Where are you?

608
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,415
Kittu, you're getting busy
with every passing day.

609
00:44:06,083 --> 00:44:09,832
l'm in Sanghi temple.
She's not here too.

610
00:44:10,416 --> 00:44:11,749
Then, not at Sanghi temple too.

611
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,665
Did you ever visit a temple
in your life?

612
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:16,249
lt's all your affection, dude.

613
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:22,707
l'm going to Gandipet, if l don't find
her there, you're dead meat.

614
00:44:26,791 --> 00:44:28,290
Did you see any girl in
white dress?

615
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,124
So his favourite colour is white.

616
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:37,290
My mummy has washed
all my white dresses.

617
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:41,707
This dress too has white,
so, l wore this.

618
00:44:41,958 --> 00:44:43,374
ls it?
- What's the program?

619
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,707
Where are we going?
- Urgently to an apparel shop.

620
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:51,665
What fine? You look like
a deadly human bomb. Come.

621
00:44:51,875 --> 00:44:54,665
Watching you in dress will
give me colour blindness.

622
00:45:02,416 --> 00:45:03,332
Am l good?

623
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,707
You were much better in that
earlier dress, you know that?

624
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,290
Will you stop it now?

625
00:45:11,416 --> 00:45:13,582
What next?
- Let's eat.

626
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:17,415
What's good here?
- Madam is good.

627
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:19,124
Get one by two!

628
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,082
Stop repartees! Get menu card.

629
00:45:22,583 --> 00:45:24,665
My BF isn't non-vegetarian.

630
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:27,082
Pure vegetarian.

631
00:45:30,333 --> 00:45:32,249
Two vegetarian meals please.

632
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,707
Food won't go down without
non-vegetarian items.

633
00:45:38,166 --> 00:45:41,165
Get one chicken biryani...

634
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:43,874
Bring it.

635
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,582
lf possible get prawn roast also.

636
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,332
l thought you don't eat non-vegetarian
and ordered vegetarian meals.

637
00:45:53,583 --> 00:45:56,749
Hey Kittu, you hit on my stomach!

638
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,415
l mean you ordered for me
and l ordered for you.

639
00:46:00,666 --> 00:46:04,124
Did you order these items for me?

640
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:11,540
Your favourite chicken leg piece.

641
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:16,124
l hate eating food without
chicken, you know?

642
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:19,957
l hate to see chicken,
how could you eat it?

643
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:22,915
Bitter gourd! l love it!

644
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:25,249
Would any man eat bitter gourd?

645
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,457
You eat chicken!

646
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:32,665
What happened?

647
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:35,457
Why are you throwing up as if
you eat something in African forest?

648
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:36,957
You ate just green leaves, right?

649
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:39,665
Am l a goat to chew leaves?

650
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:43,707
l eat goats but you made me
eat what goat eats.

651
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:48,915
Why to eat there and brush here?

652
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:50,749
lf you don't like,
you must manage it,

653
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:53,374
is it necessary to make
your mouth stink?

654
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:58,165
lf l refuse what she had ordered,
she may feel bad, right?

655
00:46:58,416 --> 00:47:02,165
l don't know who is feeling
for that idiot's feelings.

656
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:04,374
lf you don't want to get
this repeated again,

657
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:08,207
first tell me everything you
know about him.

658
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:09,874
l'll tell you.

659
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:40,040
She's so beautiful but
her tastes are so bad.

660
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:44,957
He's perfect in all aspects
but his tastes are worst.

661
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:53,207
lsn't it nice to walk and talk?
- Yes...fine. Got clarity to talk, right?

662
00:47:55,041 --> 00:47:58,290
When are you launching
your new website?

663
00:47:58,666 --> 00:47:59,457
New website?

664
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:05,040
You said you'd start a networking
site to beat Facebook.

665
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:10,540
Kittu! You don't know the difference
between WWW and WWF.

666
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:12,790
Will you open a website?

667
00:48:13,333 --> 00:48:14,624
Why did you go silent?

668
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:19,415
l mean l've many ideas, right?
l couldn't connect suddenly.

669
00:48:19,666 --> 00:48:21,707
What about you?

670
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:25,540
You wanted to launch Zalim cream
to compete with Fair & Lovely.

671
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:27,290
Zalim cream? Silly face!

672
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:29,582
Don't you know the difference between
fairness cream and Psoriasis cream?

673
00:48:29,791 --> 00:48:32,165
l'm asking you.

674
00:48:32,916 --> 00:48:35,207
Zalim cream? Still in planning.

675
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:43,332
What?- You said a lot about your
friend Akash, right?

676
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:47,665
How is he doing?
- Oh he? He's always busy.

677
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:52,749
You said he always
follows you like tail.

678
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:57,540
l mean he used but l've shrugged
him off my back.

679
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,124
To meet you, right?

680
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:03,082
His comedy is super, right?

681
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:04,665
Comedy?

682
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:09,790
That is when asked for his cell number,
it seems he said Nokia 6300,

683
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,999
and he got worried for finding enter button
and not exit button in the keyboard.

684
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:19,290
There are so many like that.

685
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:22,915
You too said many funny
things about your friend.

686
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:26,040
l can't recollect her name.
- Lavanya?

687
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:30,874
You said she takes 4 hours
to make up.

688
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:35,415
You said no need to watch horror film,
seeing her without make up is enough.

689
00:49:35,666 --> 00:49:37,124
Why don't you bring her with you?

690
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:40,332
l'm eager to see that devilish face.

691
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:44,040
Am l always follow you like tail?

692
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:49,040
Did l get worried for finding enter button
and not exit button in the keyboard?

693
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:51,957
Do l take 4 hours to make up?

694
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:55,165
Seeing face without make up
is like watching horror film?8

695
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:56,915
Did he tell that also?

696
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:00,040
Stop!

697
00:50:00,291 --> 00:50:02,790
Stealing...this is stealing...

698
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,665
What's the mischievous gestures
that two pairs of eyes make?

699
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:35,165
What are the chaos
dreams add to it?

700
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:41,040
What's the magic happening
between two hearts?

701
00:50:41,291 --> 00:50:46,249
What's this wonder
happening in my heart?

702
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:51,874
Neither it floats nor drowns,
l can decide...

703
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:57,999
This mischief is fun but
little embarrassing...

704
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:03,165
Stealing ...this is stealing...

705
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:09,957
My smile is stolen...
My mischievous looks are stolen...

706
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:43,415
My thought has been stolen...

707
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:45,957
Youth is rushing...
Life is confused...

708
00:51:46,208 --> 00:51:51,874
Who is there to seek advice?

709
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:57,207
Time is running away...
My legs are stuttering...

710
00:51:57,458 --> 00:52:03,124
Where's the right path
to go ahead?

711
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:08,749
Desires are pushing me...
Thoughts are drowning me...

712
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,832
l'm elated and happy but
little embarrassing...

713
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:59,374
Why are you anxious?
Don't know what's this change?

714
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:05,165
O heart, who is before you?

715
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:10,707
Umpteen doubts and
unlimited happiness next moment...

716
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:16,624
Gentle smile are chanting hymns...

717
00:53:16,833 --> 00:53:22,124
Something is overwhelming...
The world believes it...

718
00:53:22,375 --> 00:53:28,124
This is new experience but
little embarrassing...

719
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:22,082
Hello editor! Your publisher
who buys old papers,

720
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:24,624

it's big time for media, right?

724
00:54:36,333 --> 00:54:38,415
Why did you call me here sir?

725
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:44,082
l don't mind if you write news,
but not real news!

726
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:47,665
Sir, opposition leader is
publisher's relative, so...

727
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:50,707

728
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:52,665

729
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:54,249
We'll stop it immediately sir.

730
00:54:54,500 --> 00:55:02,499
You know my name, right? GJB!

Father...

737
00:55:21,708 --> 00:55:24,374
She's so interested,
why don't you let her go?

738
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:27,249
She's so interested,
that's why l'm thinking.

739
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:32,582
Father please, agree.
- Okay dear.

740
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,832

00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:42,832
Call Ameerpet branch.
- Why sir?

746
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:46,207
We mustn't send to the
place my daughter likes,

747
00:55:46,458 --> 00:55:49,540
she must go to the place
we send her.

748
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,707

Are we going to watch a film?

760
00:56:24,875 --> 00:56:26,832
Let's watch few sympathetic scenes.

761
00:56:29,958 --> 00:56:31,332
A massive earthquake hit China!

762
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:34,249

lt asked us to calculate
the loss of life and property.

770

Do you want to know

771
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,749
Though so many disasters hit us,

772
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,540
because this same day is
my Lalli's birthday!

773

From your Kittu!

777

You've finished it with a tea!

780
00:57:37,875 --> 00:57:41,707
For the way you greeted me,
this is too much.

781

Do you remember my birthday?

Kittu is there to remind me, right?
He gave me surprize.

787
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:15,790
You would've fallen dead!

788
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:17,582
Dead for a surprize?

789
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:19,624
Were you born on a normal day?

Why are you so late, sister-in-law?

796

Why?
- That's like that. Get on bike.

801
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:24,290
Tell me the reason for you delay.

802
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,457
O my dear, my sister-in-law

Does your sister-in-law drives a bike?

806
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:36,290
Not ordinarily but like a racer.

But fearing l would fall down,
my dad didn't let me try it.

811
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:51,957
Please teach me.

812
00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:55,165
lf you ask so sweetly,
why would l say no?

813
01:00:04,541 --> 01:00:06,207
Watch out! Careful!

814
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:25,332
Hey boy, come here.

815

847
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:30,415
When did you come back?

848
01:02:30,666 --> 01:02:31,290
Did you come back next morning?

849
01:02:31,541 --> 01:02:32,790
Did he teach you to
ride bike all the night?

850
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,332
So long?

851
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:41,707
l sent you to set this girl for me,
will you settle with her?

852
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,957
How do you know my name?

853
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,374
He raring like showroom 1000 cc bike.

854
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:11,165
Now he's dull and bland
like an old TVS 50.

855
01:03:11,416 --> 01:03:12,957
ls she any less?

856
01:03:13,208 --> 01:03:15,332
She was laughing like
a toothpaste ad girl,

857
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:18,624
she's like an aunty of pain balm ad.

858
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:21,165
What do you call her? Lovely?

859
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:24,499
Please call her once!
We'll hear it.

860
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:30,540
What did you say?
You said the boy is handsome.

861
01:03:30,791 --> 01:03:33,374
Why are you dull
as if you got beaten up?

862
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:36,832
Our boy too it seems can't bear
even 100 cms away from her.

863
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,165
Now both are maintaining
a long distance.

864
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:49,207
What happened that both
are parting in different ways?

865
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:04,790
Where?

866
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,415
Lavanya, one sign please.
For surety.

867
01:04:16,458 --> 01:04:19,165
Where is he?
- ln lCU, you've to sign this.

868
01:04:43,583 --> 01:04:46,415
Hey Kitty! Did you see what your
friend has written here?

869
01:04:46,666 --> 01:04:48,874
This time he's Lavanya's husband.

870
01:04:49,708 --> 01:04:54,332
Look here! Lavanya has signed as wife
in the no objection form.

871
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,415
When did they marry
without our knowledge?

872
01:04:57,666 --> 01:04:58,999
Let's ask them.

873
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:07,124
You both met accidentally and
we planned this accidental meeting.

874
01:05:07,333 --> 01:05:08,249
Sorry ifwe had given you tension.

875
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:12,790
Unless you meet again, the lock
between you both won't open?

876
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,249
Got better or worse you both
helped me to unite with this idiot.

877
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:20,332
We didn't want you both to split,
so we planned this.

878
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:24,874
Did you see Lavanya?
l said you met with an accident,

879
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:28,290
look, how much blood he's
donating without a doubt.

880
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:31,040
ls she any less?

881
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:34,040
Thinking you're a patient she made
juice from squeezing a dozen fruits.

882
01:05:34,250 --> 01:05:36,165
The juice you made won't
go waste, Lavanya.

883
01:05:36,416 --> 01:05:38,499
Buddy has become weak
donating blood, give it to him.

884
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:39,499
For me?

885
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:42,207
A glass juice won't be enough
for you, let's get a bucket full.

886
01:05:42,458 --> 01:05:44,665
You're too much, come out.
- Okay come.

887
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:36,499
l want to tell you something...

888
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:43,415
l want a place in your heart...

889
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:48,040
May l come?

890
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:59,165
O boy, come fast, l'm waiting...

891
01:06:59,416 --> 01:07:03,165
Don't spread your magic...

892
01:07:03,416 --> 01:07:10,290
Come...come...come fast...

893
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:53,290
Let's stay together and
unite into one..

894
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,957
Let anyone say anything,
O my dear...

895
01:07:57,208 --> 01:08:00,957
People who approve are okay,
forget those who don't approve...

896
01:08:01,125 --> 01:08:04,582
Let's be together as we wish
come what so ever it may...

897
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:08,415
lfwe're angry,
let's shout at each other...

898
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:12,249
Let's fight till anger subsides...

899
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:16,082
Come, let's fall in love, Lovely...

900
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:20,040
Let's jump into the sea of love...

901
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:02,374
Let's be close and
kiss each other...

902
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:06,124
Let's spend time counting
the kisses...

903
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:10,040
l must see you and
you must see me...

904
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:13,665
Let's be together are our lives...

905
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:17,457
You must get angry on me...

906
01:09:17,708 --> 01:09:21,290
l must say sorry to you...

907
01:09:21,541 --> 01:09:25,165
Let's melt away in
each other's arms...

908
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:29,624
Let's see the end of love,
come my dear...

909
01:09:59,250 --> 01:10:00,540
How are you dear?

910
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:03,290
What do l lack?
l've everything here.

911
01:10:03,541 --> 01:10:04,249
Except you.

912
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,332
You promised to come to see me.
Why didn't you come?

913
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:10,707
l'll come this weekend.
- No, dad, you must come immediately.

914
01:10:10,958 --> 01:10:13,082
What?

915
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:17,207
Check your mail box daddy,
l've sent you a photograph.

916
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:18,749
Whose?

917
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,582
l've posted about us to my dad.
l've mailed him your photo also.

918
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:27,707
Why didn't you parcel
and send me too?

919
01:10:27,916 --> 01:10:30,874
l don't have an idea to parcel
but l'm sure to send you.

920
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:33,082
Where to?
- To airport.

921
01:10:56,166 --> 01:11:00,332
ls it you brother?
l see new men with you.

922
01:11:00,541 --> 01:11:01,999
Have you fired the old boys?

923
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:03,374
Greetings brother.

924
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:07,915
Why is he still with you?
You should've fired him first.

925
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:12,707
That day he marred my respect
saying only show off no guts.

926
01:11:12,958 --> 01:11:16,707
l wanted to show you my guts
and thrash you.

927
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:19,957
Why didn't you plan this
attack early morning?

928
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:22,457
Do you've to come this far
with so many men in dark?

929
01:11:22,666 --> 01:11:28,790
You told me to attack anyone
in dark or outside the city, right?

930
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,665
l told you in a flow,
didn't expect you'd take it seriously.

931
01:11:32,916 --> 01:11:37,457
Okay, l'm going on a job.
Let's settle scores another time.

932
01:11:49,916 --> 01:11:51,499
Break his bones boys!

933
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,915
Stop, he'll make see you stars
in day time if you go alone,

934
01:11:55,125 --> 01:11:57,499
attack him together and
see the stars together.

935
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,457
l don't have time,
if you give the key, l'll go.

936
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:07,915
Leave my shirt, brother.

937
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:08,999
Stop brother.

938
01:13:09,208 --> 01:13:13,040
Since you're a weak villain,
my heroism is getting elevated.

939
01:13:13,291 --> 01:13:15,124
Do you know what should
one do in your position?

940
01:13:15,375 --> 01:13:17,040
Once you attacked a man,
leave him alone.

941
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:19,332
Just let him off.
lf necessary become his friend.

942
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:20,457
lf not...

943
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:22,999
Moreover bed rest too!
Do you need this?

944
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:25,040
May l tell you another logic?

945
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:27,374
You mustn't show your
power to me,

946
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:29,082
but to the man who told you!

947
01:13:31,250 --> 01:13:36,374
Brother, l understood everything
but not what he said lastly.

948
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:44,665
lf l had done this that day,
this fight scene wouldn't be there.

949
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:50,874
You could've hit him like this, right?

950
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:53,290
Just brawn is not enough
to beat him.

951
01:13:53,541 --> 01:13:54,790
one must have brain!

952
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:56,957
We don't have it.

953
01:13:57,625 --> 01:14:00,249
To make him run or defeat him,

954
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:03,124
a man with brain and
brawn must come down.

955
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:10,582
She gave a flight number...

956
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:13,249
Has it arrived or not?

957
01:14:18,291 --> 01:14:20,582
You're very handsome.

958
01:14:20,833 --> 01:14:22,499
Can you lend me your coat
for a moment?

959
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:25,165
l'll look little colourful
to my father-in-law.

960
01:14:28,416 --> 01:14:29,332
How am l?

961
01:14:31,208 --> 01:14:32,040
What?

962
01:14:33,416 --> 01:14:34,332
ls it you uncle?

963
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:37,957
Are you selling petrol in airports too?

964
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:42,374
Stop playing truant.
Watching your speed...

965
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:45,957
l think you're trapping someone.
- You're brilliant, uncle.

966
01:14:46,166 --> 01:14:48,374
But you're a crook!

967
01:14:48,708 --> 01:14:53,165
You're wearing a coat,
so you'd be planning for big money.

968
01:14:53,416 --> 01:14:54,957
You got it right, uncle.

969
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:59,957
Do it...go ahead.
You're no ordinary boy!

970
01:15:00,541 --> 01:15:03,415
Has the flight arrived or not?

971
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,040
l'll call Lovely.

972
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:07,582
What a timing!

973
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:11,957
What happened? Did you meet my daddy?
- Not yet. l'm waiting for you.

974
01:15:12,125 --> 01:15:14,540
What? Flight would've
arrived long back.

975
01:15:14,791 --> 01:15:16,457
Haven't you both see each other yet?

976
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:18,707
Don't get tensed, l'll take care.

977
01:15:18,916 --> 01:15:20,665
Tell her you've met him already.

978
01:15:24,416 --> 01:15:27,624
That's my dad's voice.
- ls it?

979
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:30,915
Sorry sir, l didn't know it was you.

980
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,499
Please come.
- No need.

981
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:36,582
lf you return my coat, l'll go.

982
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:41,124
l'll never give my things

983
01:15:58,875 --> 01:16:00,499
Throw this out.
- Why are you so late?

984
01:16:00,833 --> 01:16:04,207
The flight you got down
would've returned to Kuwait.

985
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,165
Freshen up and have dinner.

986
01:16:06,416 --> 01:16:08,624
l'm having headache,
get me a coffee.

987
01:16:08,916 --> 01:16:10,499
What happened?

988
01:16:17,583 --> 01:16:19,540
How is Akash, daddy?

989
01:16:22,041 --> 01:16:25,790
Tell me daddy.
Did you meet Akash?

990
01:16:26,125 --> 01:16:29,332
Did you talk to him?
Do you like him?

991
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:33,582
Why don't you say something, daddy?

992
01:16:33,583 --> 01:16:35,957
l had a long journey,
l'm tired dear.

993
01:16:36,208 --> 01:16:39,582
How are you?
- l'm fine dad.

994
01:16:39,583 --> 01:16:42,624
You're not telling your
opinion about Akash.

995
01:16:43,958 --> 01:16:46,415
No need.

996
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:48,624
He's fine.

997
01:16:48,916 --> 01:16:52,707
l didn't expect it, l couldn't
talk to him properly in hurry.

998
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:54,957
Shall l call him home
tomorrow, daddy?

999
01:16:56,333 --> 01:16:59,582
l've a week's work in
my Delhi office.

1000
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,290
Let me see after that.

1001
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,915
l'm asking you.
- What?

1002
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:10,874
What did my dad say?

1003
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,457
Do you've to come this far
to ask this question?

1004
01:17:14,708 --> 01:17:15,790
Can't you ask your dad?

1005
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:22,040
l asked him but he said he couldn't
talk properly because of tiredness.

1006
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:28,582
My dad is not in home, he has
gone to Delhi by morning flight.

1007
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:29,624
On some business.

1008
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,124
Daddy will be back in a week.

1009
01:17:33,833 --> 01:17:36,665
He said he'll call and talk to you.

1010
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:39,207
ls he giving another chance too?

1011
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:45,290
My dad estimates anyone
in the first meeting itself.

1012
01:17:46,333 --> 01:17:50,499
But he wants to meet you again
and this is giving me tension.

1013
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:53,290
You're doing too much.
l'm silent because he's your dad.

1014
01:17:53,291 --> 01:17:56,874
For your over build ups,
it's doesn't suit.

Did you see how much she loves me?

1115
01:30:45,041 --> 01:30:47,124
People give gifts on occasions,
but for your daughter,

1116
01:30:47,333 --> 01:30:49,915
no need of occasion,
if l'm with her, it's festival.

1117
01:30:50,375 --> 01:30:54,165
How is it, Akash?
- Price is better than the piece.

1118
01:30:54,416 --> 01:30:55,582
Shall l take this?

1119
01:30:57,625 --> 01:30:58,749
You can take it by all means.

1120
01:30:59,791 --> 01:31:01,249
This one, pack it.

1121
01:31:02,458 --> 01:31:07,749
Just Rs.2000 watch here, Rs.136000
worth watch is waiting there.

1122
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,082

01:31:14,333 --> 01:31:15,999
lf you buy without telling,

1125
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:17,624
when l'm with you,
why to pack it?

1126
01:31:17,875 --> 01:31:19,040
You can give it, right?

1127
01:31:19,291 --> 01:31:22,540
How can l give you the watch
l bought it for my dad?

1128
01:31:28,208 --> 01:31:30,415
This is Father's day gift to my dad.

1129
01:31:30,666 --> 01:31:31,957
Can't a greeting card do?

1130
01:31:32,166 --> 01:31:33,290
Do you've to buy such
an expensive gift?

1131
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:36,582
What's this formalities for
Father's Day?

1132
01:31:37,041 --> 01:31:39,874
This is not formality
but responsibility.

1133
01:31:40,041 --> 01:31:43,457
Are there mad people to follow
Father's Day too? Except you.

1134
01:31:43,708 --> 01:31:46,915
ln my opinion people not
following Father's Day are mad.

1135
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:51,207
For anyone every day
is given by father.

1136
01:31:51,458 --> 01:31:55,290
lt's our culture to consider mother
as God for giving birth to us.

1137
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:58,874
Shouldn't father have that
respect for taking care of us?

1138
01:31:59,083 --> 01:32:02,082
Can't we give at least
a gift once in a year?

1139
01:32:02,291 --> 01:32:06,040
Shouldn't we say l love you daddy
at least for one day?

1140
01:32:06,291 --> 01:32:09,582
Oh God! l didn't know
she could talk so much.

1141
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:12,290
Are you giving me that watch or not?

1142
01:32:12,541 --> 01:32:14,999
lf you want,
l'll buy you another watch.

1143
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:17,290
l like this one only,
l want this only.

1144
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,040
Okay, take it.

1145
01:32:19,583 --> 01:32:23,832
Remember one thing.
That watch belongs to my dad.

1146
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:28,457
Though you've taken it from me,
it's like my dad has given it to you.

1147
01:32:31,916 --> 01:32:35,082
What's that? Why are you
coming like a raging bull?

1148
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:36,874
Sister-in-law, your comments
are too harsh.

1149
01:32:37,083 --> 01:32:39,082
A girl loves me dearly,
you know that?

1150
01:32:39,333 --> 01:32:40,124
What's surprize in it?

1151
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:43,290
Girls now love animals
more than humans.

1152
01:32:43,500 --> 01:32:44,457
Please sister-in-law, leave me.

1153
01:32:44,708 --> 01:32:46,832
lf l'm here for sometime,
l'll get convinced l'm an animal,

1154
01:32:47,041 --> 01:32:50,540
l may voluntarily join a zoo,
please leave me.

1155
01:32:51,875 --> 01:32:53,957
Lalli is not answering
my call for the past 3 days.

1156
01:32:54,166 --> 01:32:54,999
May be phone problem.

1157
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:57,249
Not coming online too.
- May be net connection is cut.

1158
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,374
How could both stop working at a time?

1159
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:01,665
Don't know...may be her father
has cut both the lines.

1160
01:33:01,916 --> 01:33:03,540
l too fear the same.

1161
01:33:03,875 --> 01:33:04,957
What do you want to do?

1162
01:33:05,166 --> 01:33:08,499
l got a girl friend at last,
l'm sacred of missing her.

1163
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:10,124
l must meet Lalli at any cost.

1164
01:33:10,333 --> 01:33:13,499
Must talk to her or else l'll go mad.

1165
01:33:13,750 --> 01:33:16,957
Yes, l can see the symptoms.
- No jokes please.

1166
01:33:17,916 --> 01:33:18,540
l'll think.

1167
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:21,249
Not later but now,
think and give me a good idea.

1168
01:33:27,458 --> 01:33:30,457
l'll give you an idea
and a cylinder too.

1169
01:33:30,708 --> 01:33:31,957
Take it and cook a meal.

1170
01:33:32,166 --> 01:33:35,040
Why a cylinder?
Do you want me to attack her father?

1171
01:33:35,625 --> 01:33:37,374
Shall we've a frank talk?

1172
01:33:37,625 --> 01:33:40,290
lf you take the gas cylinder,
will you look like an attacker?

1173
01:33:40,541 --> 01:33:43,665
Cool! lt'll be like delivering
a gas cylinder.

1174
01:33:43,916 --> 01:33:46,582
Do you want me to meet Lalli
as a cylinder delivery boy?

1175
01:33:46,791 --> 01:33:48,707
Then, you also come with me.
Let's go together.

1176
01:33:48,958 --> 01:33:53,957
No need of me to come for this,
l'll send you a perfect match to you.

1177
01:33:56,166 --> 01:33:56,957
What's this walk?

1178
01:33:57,208 --> 01:33:59,874
Gas delivery boys must
come fast and leave fast?

1179
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:02,165
Minister is coming down.

1180
01:34:02,583 --> 01:34:04,624
What if Minister comes?
- You'll get the stick.

1181
01:34:04,875 --> 01:34:06,374
Be on the job.
- Come.

1182
01:34:09,333 --> 01:34:11,582
l think kitchen is this side.
- l think Lalli is that side.

1183
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,332
That's the kitchen.
- Who is he?

1184
01:34:18,541 --> 01:34:19,790
What's that?

1185
01:34:20,208 --> 01:34:22,207
Has he become a Minister
without knowing what this is?

1186
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:24,165
l'm asking you.

1187
01:34:26,041 --> 01:34:28,874
l know that but why did you
bring it to my house?

1188
01:34:29,041 --> 01:34:30,582
Don't you use gas?

1189
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:35,374
We use HP gas,
you've brought lndane gas.

1190
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:39,374
Why did you bring this?
- Who asked you to bring it?

1191
01:34:39,583 --> 01:34:41,457
Got caught and l'm escaping!

1192
01:34:41,708 --> 01:34:43,040
l came here trusting you.

1193
01:34:43,291 --> 01:34:46,082
No need of trusts now.
Escape!

1194
01:34:46,291 --> 01:34:48,665
Don't let the delivery boys escape.

1195
01:34:48,916 --> 01:34:50,582
They're here to hold guns
not to catch us.

1196
01:34:50,833 --> 01:34:54,332
Where you are all guys?

1197
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:56,499
What happened?
- What happened sir?

1198
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:59,957
Reliance man has called
to pay Airtel bill,

1199
01:35:00,166 --> 01:35:03,957
HP gas people are bringing
lndane gas cylinder.

1200
01:35:04,208 --> 01:35:07,249
Mistakes upon mistakes
are happening,

1201
01:35:07,458 --> 01:35:10,915
l think some mistake is
happening behind my back.

1202
01:35:11,125 --> 01:35:13,124
What is it? l must know it.

1203
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:17,207
Why does he always blow up
even trivial things?

1204
01:35:23,708 --> 01:35:26,332
l bought a gift for you, daddy,
you know that?

1205
01:35:26,583 --> 01:35:29,832
l know a cheat took it
away from you.

1206
01:35:30,166 --> 01:35:33,957
What do you want, my dear?
- You know what l want, daddy.

1207
01:35:34,166 --> 01:35:35,957
More than what you wish,

1208
01:35:36,166 --> 01:35:39,040
l feel a thing that can make
you happy is better.

1209
01:35:41,166 --> 01:35:45,624
But the question is how can you be
happy if don't give what you wish?

1210
01:35:45,833 --> 01:35:47,624
l didn't get you dad.

1211
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:49,290
Nothing dear.

1212
01:35:49,541 --> 01:35:51,832
l gave everything you
asked in a jiffy,

1213
01:35:52,041 --> 01:35:53,957
but l think this time it
is not possible.

1214
01:35:54,166 --> 01:35:55,374
Why dad?

1215
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:59,749
l mean l was in Delhi, right?
That's why!

1216
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,665
Come quickly dad.

1217
01:36:04,916 --> 01:36:07,457
Trouble!! Lalli's father...
- Has he come?- No

1218
01:36:07,708 --> 01:36:08,957
Does he know it?
- No.

1219
01:36:09,166 --> 01:36:10,415
What happened then?
- He suspects.

1220
01:36:10,666 --> 01:36:11,707
That's all?

1221
01:36:11,958 --> 01:36:14,040
lf he knows you've to worry
but he just suspects.

1222
01:36:14,291 --> 01:36:15,665
Clear it.

1223
01:36:16,291 --> 01:36:17,457
Matter is serious.

1224
01:36:17,666 --> 01:36:18,624
Security has been increased
in her home.

1225
01:36:18,875 --> 01:36:20,082
They're inquiring Lalli's friends.

1226
01:36:20,333 --> 01:36:24,582
lf my story is out, l'd be dead.
Please help me.

1227
01:36:24,833 --> 01:36:28,165
To do anything or
if my brain has to work,

1228
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:30,915
my body needs an energy drink.

1229
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:32,707
First be on it.
- What?

1230
01:36:32,916 --> 01:36:34,749
You used me like an ATM
for your necessities,

1231
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,124
now l'm out of service.

1232
01:36:36,375 --> 01:36:39,165
So, l must withdraw
from new ATM.

1233
01:36:40,791 --> 01:36:41,832
ls it gold?

1234
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:43,082
Are you this type?

1235
01:36:43,333 --> 01:36:47,290
No use in trusting ATM.
l must go to the bank directly.

1236
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:50,290
Who are you calling now?
- Anjali bank.

1237
01:36:51,083 --> 01:36:52,665
She's always open.

1238
01:36:53,833 --> 01:36:54,540
Got it.

1239
01:36:57,083 --> 01:36:58,874
Missed call from Akash?

1240
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,957
What brings you here at this hour?

1241
01:37:10,708 --> 01:37:13,582
Since you came with cash bag
and convinced me,

1242
01:37:13,833 --> 01:37:15,499
l left your daughter that day,

1243
01:37:15,791 --> 01:37:17,999
but your daughter is
not leaving me.

1244
01:37:18,416 --> 01:37:20,249
Look, how many missed calls!

1245
01:37:20,583 --> 01:37:24,290
At this late hour and
so many phone calls.

1246
01:37:24,708 --> 01:37:27,207
Again a call, your daughter again.

1247
01:37:27,458 --> 01:37:31,832
lf she tries so much,
l too feel like answering her, right?

1248
01:37:32,041 --> 01:37:34,832
Please understand me, uncle.
- l can understand.

1249
01:37:35,041 --> 01:37:38,124
You mustn't answer her calls.
Tell me what's your price?

1250
01:37:38,375 --> 01:37:42,165
You know l always prefer cash only.

1251
01:37:42,625 --> 01:37:43,540
Bye!

1252
01:37:49,208 --> 01:37:51,082
What ever it is!

1253
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:55,832
You fix drinks well,
did you work in bar?

1254
01:37:57,583 --> 01:37:59,207
What?
- Your brother.

1255
01:38:00,208 --> 01:38:04,332
lf your brother comes, don't hide
glasses, keep a new glass.

1256
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,499
Rogues! Can't you wait till l come?

1257
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:09,999
lt took me so much time to
put that devil to sleep.

1258
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:13,374
Your brother is drinking before you
and you're not asking him.

1259
01:38:13,625 --> 01:38:15,415
Why? lsn't the brand good one?

1260
01:38:15,625 --> 01:38:18,999
Brand is damn good.
Fix one for me, fast!

1261
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:22,249
You said you'll get ideas
after drinks, you've had it.

1262
01:38:22,458 --> 01:38:23,874
Soda is enough.

1263
01:38:25,041 --> 01:38:26,207
Must bring out Lalli at any cost.

1264
01:38:26,458 --> 01:38:28,874
Kittu and Lalli must meet.

1265
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:32,165
l don't know what you do.
You're bringing her.

1266
01:38:35,166 --> 01:38:36,124
lf you decide anything is possible.

1267
01:38:36,375 --> 01:38:38,582
Your network is no ordinary network.

1268
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:41,415
Does she see me like a creator?

1269
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:44,665
With my only weakness
of unable to ride a bike,

1270
01:38:45,958 --> 01:38:48,290
she handles me terribly.
- Yes brother.

1271
01:38:48,958 --> 01:38:50,124
l'll tell.
- Tell.

1272
01:38:50,375 --> 01:38:51,665
l'll take her to task.

1273
01:38:52,166 --> 01:38:53,832
l'll take her to a country
where there's no bike,

1274
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,832
and take my revenge.

1275
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,415
Then, your wish will never
get fulfilled, brother.

1276
01:39:01,375 --> 01:39:03,290
No need of it now.

1277
01:39:03,625 --> 01:39:06,374
You keep quiet. You don't know
about my ghostly sister-in-law.

1278
01:39:06,583 --> 01:39:08,082
Brother, you continue.

1279
01:39:08,833 --> 01:39:10,124
lf not now when would l talk then?

1280
01:39:10,333 --> 01:39:12,665
l'll talk bravely.
- Talk.

1281
01:39:12,916 --> 01:39:14,915
lndia got independence long back,

1282
01:39:15,083 --> 01:39:19,207
but l get my freedom only
when this devil sleeps.

1283
01:39:19,458 --> 01:39:22,582
Brother, you haven't yet
got your independence.

1284
01:39:22,791 --> 01:39:25,249
You're just hallucinating!
- What are you saying?

1285
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,665
That side, brother.

1286
01:39:30,541 --> 01:39:32,082
Didn't you sleep yet?

1287
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:34,124
l came to see your creativity
on terrace.

1288
01:39:34,333 --> 01:39:37,124
You mustn't care about
what one says after drinks.

1289
01:39:38,041 --> 01:39:39,707
Kittappa, steps are here.

1290
01:39:39,958 --> 01:39:43,832
Sister-in-law, doctor has advised
not to use steps.

1291
01:39:45,291 --> 01:39:46,957
Enough of laughing, come in.

1292
01:39:50,708 --> 01:39:54,332
You were telling someone
to bring Lalitha.

1293
01:39:54,541 --> 01:39:57,499
Who were you talking to?
- Who else? Your daughter.

1294
01:40:08,708 --> 01:40:11,374
Have you gone mad?

1295
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,415
l was taking rest in home
after a bout of fever,

1296
01:40:14,625 --> 01:40:15,499
will you make so much noise?

1297
01:40:15,708 --> 01:40:17,915
ln the enthusiasm to see you...

1298
01:40:18,125 --> 01:40:21,415
My father is very enthusiastic now.

1299
01:40:23,541 --> 01:40:25,124
Did your father like me
when l brought gas?

1300
01:40:25,375 --> 01:40:26,707
Did you hear it?

1301
01:40:26,958 --> 01:40:30,874
Hey mad man! He's fixing my
marriage with another man.

1302
01:40:31,875 --> 01:40:33,749
l love this idiot.

1303
01:40:34,583 --> 01:40:36,874
l don't know what to do.

1304
01:40:37,083 --> 01:40:41,124
Your marriage is fixed with
this idiot...l mean Kittu.

1305
01:40:41,375 --> 01:40:42,624
That too tomorrow.

1306
01:40:46,291 --> 01:40:48,290
Marrying tomorrow?

1307
01:40:49,416 --> 01:40:52,915
Once l fix up, l just go about it.

1308
01:40:53,875 --> 01:40:54,874
l mean he'll go.

1309
01:40:55,166 --> 01:40:58,499
lf her father catches him,
he'll go blind.

1310
01:40:59,166 --> 01:41:01,582
True Akash.
Managing her father,

1311
01:41:01,791 --> 01:41:05,457
or marrying them against his
wish isn't easy as you think.

1312
01:41:05,666 --> 01:41:08,082
My foot!
lsn't he managing your father?

1313
01:41:09,458 --> 01:41:10,999
Like wise l'll manage her daddy.

1314
01:41:11,541 --> 01:41:13,915
Comparing her dad with my dad?

1315
01:41:15,083 --> 01:41:17,457
Her daddy is a villain
and my daddy is a hero.

1316
01:41:21,625 --> 01:41:24,332
Her daddy is iron,
my daddy is an ice cream.

1317
01:41:27,291 --> 01:41:28,207
Did you get it?

1318
01:41:28,458 --> 01:41:30,249
You're the party's in charge
in the marriage.

1319
01:41:30,458 --> 01:41:33,790
You're making me things
l never even thought about.

1320
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,040
Her father is doing it there.

1321
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:38,665
You've to buy things
for my marriage, right?

1322
01:41:38,916 --> 01:41:40,999
l'll bring it.

1323
01:41:41,291 --> 01:41:41,957
No need.

1324
01:41:42,208 --> 01:41:43,707
There's a big shot who can boot
his marriage expenses.

1325
01:41:43,916 --> 01:41:45,457
Who is he?
- l'll tell you.

1326
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,999
My lover is next to me,
l'm getting into mood seeing her.

1327
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:53,457
l don't know what to do now!

1328
01:41:53,708 --> 01:41:54,665
What's the message?

1329
01:41:55,291 --> 01:41:57,374
Whom did you send it?
- To your sister.

1330
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,999
What?
- Hug me tightly and kiss me.

1331
01:42:06,333 --> 01:42:08,832
What's it, dear?
Are you feeling shy?

1332
01:42:09,041 --> 01:42:10,832
For the same message another
person will get scared, you know?

1333
01:42:11,041 --> 01:42:13,832
Kittu, talk the vehicle to bunk.

1334
01:42:19,958 --> 01:42:22,665
Did you see uncle?
l want to be in control.

1335
01:42:22,916 --> 01:42:25,124
But your daughter is not letting me.

1336
01:42:25,333 --> 01:42:26,999
l don't want to meet you like this.

1337
01:42:27,208 --> 01:42:29,874
But your daughter can't stay
without thinking about me.

1338
01:42:30,833 --> 01:42:34,124
lf she sends such messages,
can any man hold himself?

1339
01:42:34,375 --> 01:42:37,290
To tell the truth l wanted
to meet Anjali,

1340
01:42:37,541 --> 01:42:39,790
but l remembered your bunk
is on the way.

1341
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,915
ls it? You've done a god job.

1342
01:42:42,125 --> 01:42:45,415
Though your daughter is
torturing and tempting me,

1343
01:42:45,666 --> 01:42:46,999
just for your sake,

1344
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,749
l'm patientjust for you, uncle.

1345
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,290
ls your patience worth Rs.25000?

1346
01:42:52,541 --> 01:42:56,790
l mean Rs.25000 is okay for the hug,
after that there are kisses too.

1347
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,540
Don't talk like that.
lt's giving me shivers.

1348
01:42:59,750 --> 01:43:02,999
ls this enough?
- l'll adjust.

1349
01:43:05,375 --> 01:43:08,957
He has turned incoming calls
and messages into income.

1350
01:43:42,375 --> 01:43:43,082
Are you shocked?

1351
01:43:43,333 --> 01:43:45,624
You mustn't do things like
this or see it.

1352
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:46,582
You take rest.

1353
01:43:46,791 --> 01:43:50,582
l came here to see what isn't
to be seen or done, come.

1354
01:43:50,833 --> 01:43:54,082
You'll feel sad seeing it.
- l don't mind it.

1355
01:43:54,333 --> 01:43:59,624
l'm here to know where you'd go
and what you'd do at this hour. Go!

1356
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,249
lf you watch this you'll feel for it.

1357
01:44:13,250 --> 01:44:15,749
Where are you coming?
- Would l leave you?

1358
01:44:47,416 --> 01:44:48,790
Oh no, l can't do it.

1359
01:45:04,083 --> 01:45:11,040
When everything was going wrong
l expected this to happen.

1360
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:13,749
How dare!

1361
01:45:14,375 --> 01:45:18,165
Will you dare come to my home
and elope with my daughter?

1362
01:45:18,791 --> 01:45:20,874
What are you watching?
Kill him boys!

1363
01:45:21,083 --> 01:45:21,832
Stop!

1364
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,457
lf anyone dares to come near...

1365
01:45:26,666 --> 01:45:28,165
Don't harm my daughter.

1366
01:45:28,416 --> 01:45:30,415
Calm down sir,
why would he kill the girl he loves?

1367
01:45:30,666 --> 01:45:34,874
Stop, if you come near...
l'll kiss her.

1368
01:45:35,666 --> 01:45:37,124
No!
- l'll kiss her!

1369
01:45:37,375 --> 01:45:38,332
l'll kill you.

1370
01:45:38,583 --> 01:45:42,749
lf l kiss her before you, l don't
care if you leave me or kill me.

1371
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:45,790
No!

1372
01:45:47,375 --> 01:45:48,665
Kiss her!
- No!

1373
01:45:48,916 --> 01:45:50,332
l will!
- No!

1374
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:54,624
Come...come...

1375
01:46:10,583 --> 01:46:12,957
Will you come so late?
l've been waiting for long time.

1376
01:46:13,541 --> 01:46:14,915
Then, l'll go back.

1377
01:46:15,125 --> 01:46:17,707
l'll come tomorrow early
morning and take you.

1378
01:46:18,208 --> 01:46:21,249
l'm a loud mouth.
- Go, we planned it...

1379
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:26,415
lf her father had let you kiss her.
- Her father?

1380
01:46:26,666 --> 01:46:30,582
They'll do anything for daughter
but won't allow anyone to trouble them,

1381
01:46:30,833 --> 01:46:31,915
you fathers!

1382
01:46:35,541 --> 01:46:38,249
What are those vehicles?
What's that speed?

1383
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:40,040
ls it a race?

1384
01:46:42,833 --> 01:46:44,749
This is not race but chase, uncle.

1385
01:46:45,458 --> 01:46:46,874
Your father-in-law is coming.

1386
01:46:47,208 --> 01:46:48,790
Start...

1387
01:46:51,541 --> 01:46:53,707
What happened?
- lt's not starting.

1388
01:46:59,375 --> 01:47:01,040
Come...come...

1389
01:47:15,125 --> 01:47:17,624
lt's written on the wheel.

1390
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:19,082
Run...run...

1391
01:47:19,333 --> 01:47:22,540
Why are you looking at me?
Look at her.

1392
01:47:25,333 --> 01:47:26,499
Come this side.

1393
01:47:28,416 --> 01:47:30,165
Akash, do something.

1394
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:37,124
Why am l here?
l've come around.

1395
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,665
l'll go to Assembly tomorrow only
if my daughter comes home.

1396
01:47:42,916 --> 01:47:45,790
Kill people with her
and bring her home.

1397
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,957
Okay boss.
- Come on!- Go...go...

1398
01:47:51,541 --> 01:47:54,582
Why has he suddenly backed off?
- That's known as fear of life.

1399
01:47:54,833 --> 01:47:55,624
lf old generation is like that,

1400
01:47:55,875 --> 01:47:57,165
how should modern generation
like us must be.

1401
01:47:57,375 --> 01:47:58,874
Come...come...

1402
01:47:59,291 --> 01:47:59,957
This side...

1403
01:48:07,916 --> 01:48:09,415
Who are you? Move away!

1404
01:48:16,291 --> 01:48:17,124
This side...

1405
01:48:21,625 --> 01:48:23,790
Where are they?
- What shall we do now?

1406
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,582
Chase is over, let's go.

1407
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:30,749
Hand over madam to us.
- Send Mangalam to us.

1408
01:48:30,958 --> 01:48:31,749
You keep quiet.

1409
01:48:32,041 --> 01:48:33,790
Mangalam? Who is he?

1410
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,040
ls there any Mangalam with us?
- No.

1411
01:48:37,291 --> 01:48:39,082
Nobody by that name, go.

1412
01:48:40,541 --> 01:48:41,915
l'm Mangalam.

1413
01:48:43,416 --> 01:48:44,790
Kill him!

1414
01:48:45,458 --> 01:48:47,207
How did you get caught with them?

1415
01:48:47,416 --> 01:48:50,415
Didn't get caught by mistake
joined their gang.

1416
01:48:51,333 --> 01:48:52,665
No need of it, let's go.

1417
01:48:52,916 --> 01:48:54,707
Send our madam.

1418
01:48:56,333 --> 01:48:58,582
Send Mangalam here if not...

1419
01:48:58,791 --> 01:48:59,832
We'll send him if you send her.

1420
01:49:00,041 --> 01:49:01,957
You send first.
- Shut up.

1421
01:49:02,833 --> 01:49:04,582
Go.
- Come. You go.

1422
01:49:04,833 --> 01:49:07,582
Will you send Lalli for Mangalam?
- l know you keep quiet.

1423
01:49:08,708 --> 01:49:09,832
No problem, you go.

1424
01:49:11,125 --> 01:49:13,082
l'll take you to task later.

1425
01:49:15,958 --> 01:49:18,374
l'm coming, Lalli. l'll come tomorrow.
- Go now.

1426
01:49:25,458 --> 01:49:26,540
Again escape!

1427
01:49:26,750 --> 01:49:28,374
Did she come for you?
- For me only.

1428
01:49:28,583 --> 01:49:30,832
Why did she go with him then?
- That's my fate. Come...

1429
01:49:32,583 --> 01:49:33,624
Kill him!

1430
01:49:35,333 --> 01:49:36,040
Run...

1431
01:49:36,250 --> 01:49:37,332
Get them in.

1432
01:49:37,791 --> 01:49:39,749
lf you do anything, l'll kill you.

1433
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:40,749
They're taking away Mangalam.

1434
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,707
No need of him,
they're taking Lalli.

1435
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:44,624
You go!

1436
01:49:57,041 --> 01:50:00,624
Move away!
- Why should we?

1437
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,374
Do you know what did
Mangalam do with you?

1438
01:50:02,625 --> 01:50:04,415
What did he do?
- Planted a bomb in your Qualis.

1439
01:50:04,666 --> 01:50:05,749
Bomb?

1440
01:50:06,416 --> 01:50:09,790
lt seems he has planted
bomb in ourjeep. Run away!

1441
01:50:32,708 --> 01:50:33,957
Get in!

1442
01:50:40,333 --> 01:50:41,124
Not me but he!

1443
01:50:44,875 --> 01:50:48,457
Everything is there.
Just the groom must come now.

1444
01:50:49,166 --> 01:50:50,624
He'll be here.

1445
01:50:56,791 --> 01:50:58,499
He's here! You can start!
- Okay.

1446
01:50:59,375 --> 01:51:00,957
You came running, right?
Why are you so late?

1447
01:51:01,208 --> 01:51:04,624
Bride and groom please sit here.

1448
01:51:04,875 --> 01:51:07,290
Lalli, come.

1449
01:51:08,375 --> 01:51:09,832
Come, sit here.

1450
01:51:11,291 --> 01:51:14,165
l've been watching you,
l brought them safely here,

1451
01:51:14,416 --> 01:51:15,707
you're not even acknowledging it.

1452
01:51:15,958 --> 01:51:18,790
What's so great about it?
Didn't we arrange things here?

1453
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,415
No recognitions for
doing your duty.

1454
01:51:21,666 --> 01:51:24,207
What you did and
what l did are same?

1455
01:51:24,458 --> 01:51:29,207
Same or not is the question,
we've done or not is important.

1456
01:51:29,833 --> 01:51:32,040
Looks like l'll have to conduct
their marriage too.

1457
01:51:32,291 --> 01:51:33,915
You can, but first finish
my marriage.

1458
01:51:34,125 --> 01:51:36,749
Why are you rushing?
- You can't understand it.

1459
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,249
How much would you take
to complete this marriage?

1460
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:44,665
lt'll take 2 or 3 hours...
- No chance in finishing in 2 minutes.

1461
01:51:44,875 --> 01:51:48,124
This is marriage not a race
to tie the knot fast.

1462
01:51:48,375 --> 01:51:52,874
He'll talk like that only,
you take your own time.

1463
01:51:53,083 --> 01:51:56,749
Though you may marry fast,
you've to wait till dark for first night.

1464
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:00,374
l'm not eager for that
l'm scared they may come.

1465
01:52:01,625 --> 01:52:03,457
This is the temple, come up.

1466
01:52:03,708 --> 01:52:06,165
ls it necessary to listen
to song in this situation?

1467
01:52:06,416 --> 01:52:09,999
These are not songs
but hymns CD rip.

1468
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:14,540
Finding it difficult to remember,
l've downloaded to phone.

1469
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:16,707
Can't you play it in loud speaker?

1470
01:52:17,041 --> 01:52:18,499
l'll listen and repeat.

1471
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:20,332
Come on boys!

1472
01:52:20,583 --> 01:52:22,665
Her father is here with men.

1473
01:52:22,916 --> 01:52:25,790
lf you abuse my father,
l'll hack you.

1474
01:52:29,041 --> 01:52:30,374
Do something.

1475
01:52:35,041 --> 01:52:36,415
Why are you so cool?

1476
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:37,790
What magic are you planning now?

1477
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:42,457
No need of magic, its enough
if he understands logic.- Logic?

1478
01:52:43,083 --> 01:52:45,499
Stop...stop...

1479
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:47,207
Why are you conducting your
daughter's marriage secretly?

1480
01:52:47,458 --> 01:52:48,749
To avoid publicity.

1481
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,082
Why are you shunning publicity
even for an inter-caste marriage?

1482
01:52:51,083 --> 01:52:54,582
Did you accept this marriage because
groom's caste is dominant here?

1483
01:52:54,833 --> 01:52:58,415
Do you expect to get the 60000
votes of his caste after the marriage?

1484
01:52:58,666 --> 01:53:01,082
Are they interviewing me
or giving us information?

1485
01:53:01,333 --> 01:53:02,249
lnformation is correct.

1486
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:05,707
Did l ever do anything
for political gain?

1487
01:53:05,958 --> 01:53:06,999
The same now also.

1488
01:53:07,250 --> 01:53:10,790
l wanted this marriage to
be simple, so in a temple.

1489
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,374
Caste votes?

1490
01:53:12,625 --> 01:53:15,790
My son-in-law will ask,
why should l bother?

1491
01:53:16,666 --> 01:53:18,915
He understood the logic.
- l'm here my dear.

1492
01:53:19,125 --> 01:53:21,415
Had you told me,
l would've brought a silk sari!

1493
01:53:21,666 --> 01:53:23,790
You sir, you too sit, son-in-law.
- No problem.

1494
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,790
What are you waiting for, priest?
Do it fast.- Okay.

1495
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:37,040
My daddy would be happy for
arranging this marriage.

1496
01:54:01,166 --> 01:54:09,624
Waves of wishes are
pulling towards you...

1497
01:54:09,958 --> 01:54:17,665
So many wishes and desires,
each one is wishing for you only...

1498
01:54:18,916 --> 01:54:26,999
With you even chill winter
is like hot summer...

1499
01:54:27,208 --> 01:54:35,040
ls time twirling in the blowing wind
and in your hot hugs?

1500
01:54:37,875 --> 01:54:41,040
How many marks would you give me?

1501
01:54:42,291 --> 01:54:44,082
100%!

1502
01:54:46,541 --> 01:54:49,665
When would you hug me tightly?

1503
01:54:51,041 --> 01:54:53,290
Boy, cool...

1504
01:55:30,833 --> 01:55:35,165
l don't believe myself that
l've become yours...

1505
01:55:35,375 --> 01:55:45,332
You've tempted my thoughts
in a jiffy...

1506
01:55:47,416 --> 01:55:51,915
l'll become your breath...

1507
01:55:52,125 --> 01:55:56,540
l'll become sari draping you...

1508
01:55:56,791 --> 01:55:58,915
Never seen or heard before...
Unknown to sleep...

1509
01:55:59,125 --> 01:56:01,957
Our bodies unite in the bliss..

1510
01:56:07,250 --> 01:56:10,707
Though you say no, it's mere waste...

1511
01:56:11,750 --> 01:56:13,540
Don't be stubborn...

1512
01:56:16,416 --> 01:56:19,290
lf l refuse to go...

1513
01:56:20,500 --> 01:56:22,457
l'll see your end...

1514
01:56:47,166 --> 01:56:51,540
When l come you shivering in cold,
shyness will vanish from you...

1515
01:56:51,791 --> 01:56:55,207
A deluge is about to
overrun me...

1516
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,332
ln the chill breeze if l do
what l want touching you...

1517
01:57:00,583 --> 01:57:03,665
We'll cross the line of decency...

1518
01:57:03,916 --> 01:57:08,249
Who writes the fate
to cross that line?

1519
01:57:08,458 --> 01:57:12,832
When will l be offered
you as my wife?

1520
01:57:13,041 --> 01:57:15,207
Without waking up, sleepy eyes...

1521
01:57:15,458 --> 01:57:18,374
When it realises,
it's never ending happiness...

1522
01:57:23,750 --> 01:57:26,999
When l my hands join yours...

1523
01:57:28,166 --> 01:57:30,540
l'm yours...

1524
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:35,582
When l tie the knot with you...

1525
01:57:36,875 --> 01:57:39,165
Everything is peace...

1526
01:58:03,083 --> 01:58:04,249
What uncle?

1527
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:06,374
You never call me,
why have you called me?

1528
01:58:07,625 --> 01:58:10,082
Did you find any match for Anjali?

1529
01:58:10,958 --> 01:58:14,040
Did you call to tell
my account is over?

1530
01:58:14,291 --> 01:58:16,082
Don't rush boy!

1531
01:58:16,333 --> 01:58:19,332
l called you to close
your account once for all.

1532
01:58:20,208 --> 01:58:23,415
Come to bunk immediately.
- lmmediately?

1533
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,582
l'm little busy now.
l'll come later.

1534
01:58:28,833 --> 01:58:34,124
Okay, if you're so busy,
l'll find and come to your home.

1535
01:58:34,375 --> 01:58:35,582
Home? No need uncle.

1536
01:58:35,791 --> 01:58:38,415
Sister-in-law will there and
there will be trouble.

1537
01:58:38,625 --> 01:58:42,082
l'll come immediately.
- That's better.

1538
01:58:42,333 --> 01:58:46,582
Come, show your speed today.

1539
01:58:51,875 --> 01:58:53,290
Sir, here only!

1540
01:58:53,875 --> 01:58:54,540
This is the place.

1541
01:58:54,791 --> 01:58:57,707
Have you made such a big plan for me?

1542
01:58:57,916 --> 01:59:07,832
Come in.

1543
01:59:12,916 --> 01:59:15,165
Why did you stop there? Come.

1544
01:59:15,416 --> 01:59:18,707
What's this uncle? These guns
and dens, do we need it?

1545
01:59:18,958 --> 01:59:20,874
Enough of your act!

1546
01:59:21,083 --> 01:59:24,290
David sir, that's him l told you about.

1547
01:59:36,625 --> 01:59:41,999
Uncle, l'm confused because my brain
map isn't matching with scene here.

1548
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:46,082
Look, the same speed.
l told David about you.

1549
01:59:46,333 --> 01:59:47,707
l wanted to introduce you,
so l called you.

1550
01:59:47,958 --> 01:59:50,790
Hearing your voice in phone,
l thought you'd thrash me.

1551
01:59:51,791 --> 01:59:53,665
Have you arranged a meeting?

1552
01:59:56,083 --> 01:59:59,832
Sir knows only to cut hands,
he won't shake hands.

1553
02:00:00,875 --> 02:00:03,374
He's Robert, David's brother.

1554
02:00:04,416 --> 02:00:08,165
Leave all that, come to the point.

1555
02:00:09,625 --> 02:00:16,540
How long will you earn in thousands
by blackmailing fathers of girls,

1556
02:00:16,791 --> 02:00:20,749
if you do David's job,
you can settle down with one job.

1557
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:25,207
What's the job?
- l'll tell you, do whatever l ask.

1558
02:00:25,458 --> 02:00:28,040
Take what ever you want.

1559
02:00:28,750 --> 02:00:32,790
Do you know to speak Telugu?
- Do you know him?

1560
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,999
lt seems you've trapped this
man's daughter in love.

1561
02:00:50,416 --> 02:00:52,665
lf you get into contact with him,

1562
02:00:52,916 --> 02:00:54,707
don't stop yourself with small bucks,

1563
02:00:54,958 --> 02:00:59,332
if you bring him to David,
he'll pay 50 notjust 25!

1564
02:00:59,583 --> 02:01:01,957
Not thousands but lakhs!

1565
02:01:02,916 --> 02:01:05,457
Take as much as you want.
l want him.

1566
02:01:05,666 --> 02:01:07,790
That's okay. But what's the matter?

1567
02:01:09,666 --> 02:01:13,874
lf you know where he is, tell us.
Or else bring him to us.

1568
02:01:14,666 --> 02:01:17,624
But l don't accept deals
without knowing the details.

1569
02:01:17,875 --> 02:01:20,915
l'll tell you, calm down boy.

1570
02:01:21,750 --> 02:01:25,207
David sir, l told you the boy
is very sharp.

1571
02:01:25,458 --> 02:01:26,582
Yourjob is done.

1572
02:01:26,791 --> 02:01:29,165
You tell him what ever you told me.

1573
02:01:29,416 --> 02:01:30,082
Okay.

1574
02:01:31,375 --> 02:01:33,582
His name is Mangalampalli Maharadhi.

1575
02:01:33,833 --> 02:01:37,874
He appears like a big businessman.
But he's a fraud!

1576
02:01:44,333 --> 02:01:46,540
He cheated America
with 5 million dollars.

1577
02:01:46,791 --> 02:01:48,665
He swindled crores of Dirhams in Dubai.

1578
02:01:48,916 --> 02:01:50,999
He defrauded 2 millions in Australia.

1579
02:01:57,375 --> 02:02:00,582
But nobody has been able
to catch him.

1580
02:02:01,583 --> 02:02:02,540
Who ever he may be...

1581
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:09,249
He only played with money
but human lives also.

1582
02:02:10,875 --> 02:02:14,415
He came to Mumbai 10 years ago.
He said some business.

1583
02:02:14,625 --> 02:02:16,957
He was married by then.

1584
02:02:17,166 --> 02:02:20,540
But he hid that and secretly
trapped my sister.

1585
02:02:20,833 --> 02:02:21,832
He said love.

1586
02:02:22,333 --> 02:02:23,290
Promised marriage.

1587
02:02:23,958 --> 02:02:30,332
But he ruined her and escaped
with what ever he could take.

1588
02:02:31,291 --> 02:02:34,415
My sister didn't ask for him
after getting cheated.

1589
02:02:36,708 --> 02:02:38,665
She wanted his death!

1590
02:02:39,375 --> 02:02:44,332
From that day l've been
searching for him.

1591
02:02:44,541 --> 02:02:46,457
He vanished from lndia.

1592
02:02:47,125 --> 02:02:49,457
He changed addresses in abroad.

1593
02:02:49,791 --> 02:02:52,665
Came to know he's here now.

1594
02:02:53,291 --> 02:02:55,415
Mustn't miss him this time.

1595
02:02:56,791 --> 02:02:57,957
He must die!

1596
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,249
lnquired about his business.

1597
02:03:02,875 --> 02:03:07,165
Came to know he has lost
all the stolen money.

1598
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:10,290
lnquired about his family.

1599
02:03:11,958 --> 02:03:17,040
Came to know his doted
daughter is in love with you.

1600
02:03:18,583 --> 02:03:22,749
lf he meets you, just give
me the information.

1601
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,499
Why beat around the bush?

1602
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:32,957
He loves his daughter, right?
Get her and he'll come to us.

1603
02:03:33,208 --> 02:03:34,374
You keep quiet, Chote.

1604
02:03:34,958 --> 02:03:38,624
Hey lover boy! Go and
bring him at any cost.

1605
02:03:40,125 --> 02:03:40,957
One minute.

1606
02:03:41,875 --> 02:03:43,415
l forgot to tell you one thing.

1607
02:03:44,791 --> 02:03:47,249
You saw his original face
in the photo.

1608
02:03:48,750 --> 02:03:50,790
But he never comes out
with that face.

1609
02:03:52,333 --> 02:03:53,665
With a different get up every day,

1610
02:03:55,166 --> 02:03:56,540
with a new disguise every 3 hours,

1611
02:03:57,541 --> 02:03:59,874
he keeps on changing colours.

1612
02:04:01,083 --> 02:04:04,207
Watch the get ups he dons.

1613
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,332
You'll get an idea.

1614
02:04:53,041 --> 02:04:54,957
You scoundrel!
How many times should l call you?

1615
02:04:55,208 --> 02:04:56,790
How long will you escape?

1616
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,040
Can't we catch ifyou don't
answer the call?

1617
02:04:59,291 --> 02:05:03,082
We'll not spare you alive for
cheating us of 100 crores.

1618
02:05:08,958 --> 02:05:12,499
Your eyes, legs and hands are intact.

1619
02:05:12,750 --> 02:05:17,582
l thought Babu Rao called
to avenge you.

1620
02:05:17,833 --> 02:05:22,374
There will be plans and
revenges for international frauds,

1621
02:05:22,625 --> 02:05:25,207
small timers won't have that much!

1622
02:05:25,458 --> 02:05:28,790
You're talking indifferently.

1623
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,624
That's my cell phone.

1624
02:05:32,750 --> 02:05:37,040
Can stop the phone easily but difficult
to stop David who is here for you.

1625
02:05:37,250 --> 02:05:41,624
David? How do you know David?
- So, what he told is true!

1626
02:05:41,875 --> 02:05:42,957
What did he tell about me?

1627
02:05:43,208 --> 02:05:46,957
He told me what you are and
promised to pay anything for you.

1628
02:05:47,166 --> 02:05:48,832
Not that..
- No please.

1629
02:05:49,041 --> 02:05:51,874
l can't hear cock and bull
stories from you.

1630
02:05:52,291 --> 02:05:55,374
When you did this to know about
the man your daughter loves,

1631
02:05:55,625 --> 02:05:57,624
l thought you were a great father,

1632
02:05:58,208 --> 02:06:00,624
but never thought you'd be a cheat,

1633
02:06:01,166 --> 02:06:03,915
you've a set up and
a get up everyday,

1634
02:06:04,083 --> 02:06:06,165
moreover acting like an honest man,

1635
02:06:06,416 --> 02:06:08,457
do you how cheap it is to hear this?

1636
02:06:09,791 --> 02:06:13,374
Yes, l'm a fraud.
l agree.

1637
02:06:15,041 --> 02:06:18,749
l've been eluding everyone
for 25 years now,

1638
02:06:19,208 --> 02:06:22,457
l can vanish again
without a trace,

1639
02:06:23,541 --> 02:06:25,874
but do you know why l came
to this place?

1640
02:06:26,166 --> 02:06:27,874
My Lovely called and
told l love a boy,

1641
02:06:28,041 --> 02:06:33,957
and he resembles a lot
with you, l got alarmed,

1642
02:06:34,166 --> 02:06:36,582
l saw you in the airport
and got it confirmed.

1643
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:41,665
l came here to see how you are
for my daughter,

1644
02:06:41,916 --> 02:06:43,999
but unexpectedly you came
to know about me.

1645
02:06:44,250 --> 02:06:47,082
Enough!
l'm much better compared to you.

1646
02:06:47,291 --> 02:06:49,124
We both know it.

1647
02:06:49,375 --> 02:06:51,790
lnfact you are not qualified
to check me.

1648
02:06:53,333 --> 02:06:57,749
For asking your coat in the airport,
l appeared like a wastrel to you,

1649
02:06:57,958 --> 02:07:00,957
you've stolen crores,
how would you look like to me?

1650
02:07:04,166 --> 02:07:06,749
Will you tell David about
my whereabouts?

1651
02:07:18,791 --> 02:07:21,249
Why didn't you come to
the school to pick me up?

1652
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,749
l told you to go to supermarket,
why didn't you go?

1653
02:07:31,875 --> 02:07:35,165
As if going out will kill you,
why are you not going out?

1654
02:07:35,375 --> 02:07:38,082
Whatever l'm asking, he's silent.

1655
02:07:47,041 --> 02:07:48,124
Tell me Lovely.

1656
02:07:48,583 --> 02:07:52,165
My father promised to come
back from Delhi yesterday.

1657
02:07:52,416 --> 02:07:55,790
But he hasn't yet comeback.
His mobile is switched off.

1658
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:58,790
No reply for mails.
l'm worried.

1659
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:02,499
Will my daddy come back?
There won't be any problem, right?

1660
02:08:02,750 --> 02:08:06,124
Come to our meeting spot,
l need to talk to you.

1661
02:08:21,500 --> 02:08:23,665
Do you know what you're saying?

1662
02:08:24,916 --> 02:08:27,165
l know! That's why l'm telling you.

1663
02:08:27,416 --> 02:08:30,915
You and our love is important to me.

1664
02:08:31,125 --> 02:08:34,332
Not your daddy.
- But my daddy is important to me.

1665
02:08:34,583 --> 02:08:38,082
Why do always crib about father?

1666
02:08:38,333 --> 02:08:40,457
Are you the only one with a father?
Don't others have father?

1667
02:08:40,666 --> 02:08:43,040
May l'm the only one to
have such a father.

1668
02:08:43,291 --> 02:08:45,249
You don't know about my daddy.

1669
02:08:45,458 --> 02:08:48,999
How he raised me and what he
had done for me, only l know.

1670
02:08:49,208 --> 02:08:54,540
You saw me, you liked
and then loved me,

1671
02:08:54,875 --> 02:08:59,540
but my daddy started loving me
ever since my mother got pregnant.

1672
02:09:01,333 --> 02:09:04,582
That's why l hate this father
and daughter relationship.

1673
02:09:05,416 --> 02:09:08,249
You go on talk about father
without understanding anything.

1674
02:09:08,458 --> 02:09:11,790
What should l understand?
Without listening to my daddy,

1675
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,624
without even trying to convince him,

1676
02:09:14,875 --> 02:09:17,499
if you ask me to come with you,
how should l understand?

1677
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:22,499
Didn't love you because you're
Maharadhi's daughter or somebody's niece.

1678
02:09:23,166 --> 02:09:26,040
l don't have the necessity
to impress anyone else.

1679
02:09:26,375 --> 02:09:31,165
You're my lover, your safety and
happiness is more important to me.

1680
02:09:31,416 --> 02:09:32,540
That's why l'm asking you.

1681
02:09:32,791 --> 02:09:35,207
Come with me, l'll protect you.

1682
02:09:35,458 --> 02:09:38,915
You're talking as if l'm in a danger.

1683
02:09:39,083 --> 02:09:42,332
You could be in danger
because of your father.

1684
02:09:45,875 --> 02:09:47,124
l think you're with wrong idea.

1685
02:09:47,375 --> 02:09:49,499
Come out of it first.
lt's wrong to do like this.

1686
02:09:49,708 --> 02:09:52,457
So you find what l do or
say is wrong, right?

1687
02:09:52,875 --> 02:09:54,290
Won't your daddy commit
any mistakes?

1688
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:56,457
lsn't there any risk of you falling
in danger because of it?

1689
02:09:56,708 --> 02:09:59,790
My father never made me take a wrong
step even while teaching me to walk.

1690
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:02,249
lt's wrong to think that
he would do wrong.

1691
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:05,415
You're building a wall
between us with your daddy.

1692
02:10:05,666 --> 02:10:09,249
Why are you saying like that?
My father united us.

1693
02:10:10,541 --> 02:10:13,165
Did your father unite us?

1694
02:10:13,458 --> 02:10:16,082
The way my daddy raised me
made you like me.

1695
02:10:16,333 --> 02:10:19,582
Your similarity with my dad
made you my lover.

1696
02:10:19,833 --> 02:10:23,040
lt did, right? l'm asking as
your lover, come with me.

1697
02:10:23,250 --> 02:10:29,957
l love you but l've greater love,
affection and respect for my father.

1698
02:10:30,125 --> 02:10:32,040
l can't come with you

1699
02:11:56,250 --> 02:12:00,999
l've problems but
why are you getting drunk?

1700
02:12:02,666 --> 02:12:04,707
Though you may have many problems,

1701
02:12:04,958 --> 02:12:09,207
l've only one but that's enough,
to make me drunk!

1702
02:12:09,416 --> 02:12:12,332
Only one problem?
What's the problem?

1703
02:12:12,666 --> 02:12:15,624
Who else?
Your daughter!

1704
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:19,582
She thinks her father is like
an elder brother of Mother Teresa.

1705
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,915
She doesn't know you're a worse
criminal than Dawood lbrahim.

1706
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,124
Good bye to you and your daughter.

1707
02:12:27,541 --> 02:12:31,582
l never thought l would have
a fourth peg in my life.

1708
02:12:31,833 --> 02:12:34,665
But you've made me
drink half bottle.

1709
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:52,165
Your brothers-in-law are here!
They've come in an AC car.

1710
02:12:52,416 --> 02:12:53,790
Would you like to go with them?

1711
02:12:57,291 --> 02:13:01,290
You escaped from me
but l got you now.

1712
02:13:02,333 --> 02:13:05,374
But he mustn't be before my eyes.

1713
02:13:06,333 --> 02:13:07,999
But under my feet.

1714
02:13:15,125 --> 02:13:18,832
Won't you let us celebrate
farewell party too?

1715
02:13:20,250 --> 02:13:24,999
You give order for food,
l'll feed them what they want.

1716
02:13:34,291 --> 02:13:36,874
l put to sleep one who
attacked me suddenly.

1717
02:13:37,083 --> 02:13:39,165
Would l leave if you attack directly?

1718
02:13:49,166 --> 02:13:49,874
Come on boys!

1719
02:14:05,791 --> 02:14:09,707
Are you really from Mumbai
or Moosapet?

1720
02:14:10,250 --> 02:14:13,332
You're carrying so many guns
but not using one.

1721
02:14:17,333 --> 02:14:18,874
l want him alive.

1722
02:14:34,416 --> 02:14:37,624
Uncle, l was telling you something
which l stopped for these goons,

1723
02:14:39,125 --> 02:14:40,624
l'll continue it now,

1724
02:14:40,875 --> 02:14:42,332
l'm breaking up with your daughter,

1725
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:45,290
l'm deleting her from here.

1726
02:14:47,750 --> 02:14:49,957
Did you see how it's coming out?

1727
02:14:54,416 --> 02:14:56,124
l'll format my heart.

1728
02:14:56,583 --> 02:15:00,582
Forget about remembering,
there won't be any trace of her.

1729
02:16:07,625 --> 02:16:08,540
Leave him!

1730
02:16:08,791 --> 02:16:11,290
He beat my brother
right before my eyes.

1731
02:16:11,958 --> 02:16:13,290
l'll not leave him.

1732
02:16:56,500 --> 02:16:58,457
Why did you bring me to my house?

1733
02:16:59,125 --> 02:17:02,165
Go uncle.
- You're asking me to go.

1734
02:17:02,416 --> 02:17:03,957
Planning to get rid of me?

1735
02:17:04,208 --> 02:17:05,957
Yourjob is done, right?

1736
02:17:07,208 --> 02:17:08,540
Myjob?

1737
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,540
l know, uncle. Why you came here?
What you've done?

1738
02:17:11,750 --> 02:17:13,999
What you're taking?
l know everything.

1739
02:17:24,541 --> 02:17:25,832
What's this?

1740
02:17:26,125 --> 02:17:30,374
To make me say l hate Lavanya,
do you've to make so many plans?

1741
02:17:30,916 --> 02:17:35,582
To get me out of your daughter's life,
do you've to commit so many crimes?

1742
02:17:36,958 --> 02:17:38,624
l know your problem, uncle.

1743
02:17:38,875 --> 02:17:40,332
That l'm right choice for
your daughter.

1744
02:17:40,541 --> 02:17:42,124
l'm not suitable to be
your son-in-law.

1745
02:17:42,375 --> 02:17:44,040
You've decided it long back.

1746
02:17:45,583 --> 02:17:48,082
lnstead of making your
daughter hate me,

1747
02:17:48,291 --> 02:17:50,999
it's easy to make me say l hate her,

1748
02:17:51,208 --> 02:17:52,582
so you imported that Mumbai gang,

1749
02:17:53,125 --> 02:17:56,290
and made them narrate
stories to me,

1750
02:17:57,666 --> 02:17:59,582
you branded yourself a fraud,

1751
02:18:00,291 --> 02:18:02,332
you made yourself a womanizer,

1752
02:18:03,416 --> 02:18:05,374
got insulted as a defaulter,

1753
02:18:06,291 --> 02:18:08,415
enacted fear of enemies,

1754
02:18:09,041 --> 02:18:10,582
l know everything,

1755
02:18:12,083 --> 02:18:15,124
you don't have any property,
and that you're characterless,

1756
02:18:15,375 --> 02:18:17,124
and if l know you've a threat,

1757
02:18:17,375 --> 02:18:19,540
uninterested to enter troubled waters,

1758
02:18:19,791 --> 02:18:22,165
you thought l'd leave
your daughter, right?

1759
02:18:22,791 --> 02:18:26,749
But l didn't leave Lavanya
for those reasons,

1760
02:18:27,041 --> 02:18:28,915
just because of you,

1761
02:18:31,125 --> 02:18:35,665
after raising her for years how could
she choose such a life partner,

1762
02:18:35,916 --> 02:18:38,290
a girl who followed me
and my diary,

1763
02:18:38,541 --> 02:18:40,790
how could she follow this wastrel,

1764
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:44,499
without knowing you got
angry on your daughter,

1765
02:18:44,750 --> 02:18:47,332
a little sadness crept into you,

1766
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:53,415
to get rid it, though l knew
you were playing a game,

1767
02:18:53,833 --> 02:18:55,957
l wantonly was little harsh
with Lavanya,

1768
02:18:56,875 --> 02:18:59,624
even today your daughter
is not my lover,

1769
02:19:00,041 --> 02:19:03,082
you've proved that
she's still your daughter.

1770
02:19:03,833 --> 02:19:06,124
There are many men who become fathers,

1771
02:19:06,708 --> 02:19:10,624
but there are rare men who
become role models to fathers,

1772
02:19:11,166 --> 02:19:11,999
like you!

1773
02:19:15,416 --> 02:19:18,499
Basically l never liked father
and daughter relationship,

1774
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:22,999
after seeing you and Lovely,
my respect for it grew many times.

1775
02:19:24,083 --> 02:19:27,915
l don't want to separate you
father and daughter.

1776
02:19:28,083 --> 02:19:31,457
To make your relationship win...

1777
02:19:33,458 --> 02:19:36,707
You got strained all these days,
take rest.

1778
02:19:41,208 --> 02:19:45,249
l think affect of fight scene,
little painful.

1779
02:19:45,916 --> 02:19:48,499
l didn't tell you about
that fight, right?

1780
02:19:49,125 --> 02:19:54,957
l knew you called them
there to scare me.

1781
02:19:55,416 --> 02:19:58,707
l knew they would only create a
scene and never harm you.

1782
02:19:58,958 --> 02:20:00,832
But still l beat them,
you know why?

1783
02:20:01,041 --> 02:20:05,082
The day l was called and told about
the Mumbai backdrop story,

1784
02:20:05,333 --> 02:20:06,332
one amongst them...

1785
02:20:06,541 --> 02:20:08,499
He loves the daughter, right?
Kill her.

1786
02:20:08,750 --> 02:20:11,957
Man who took money
from you to act here,

1787
02:20:12,166 --> 02:20:13,707
blabbered about my Lovely,

1788
02:20:13,958 --> 02:20:15,790
sorry about your Lovely,

1789
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,290
l didn't like him talking about her,

1790
02:20:18,875 --> 02:20:21,665
l was drunk when they
came here, right?

1791
02:20:22,500 --> 02:20:25,499
l got little emotional.

1792
02:20:26,041 --> 02:20:29,040
When you visit them in hospital,
tell them my inquiries.

1793
02:20:29,791 --> 02:20:31,249
l hit them hard.

1794
02:20:31,583 --> 02:20:34,207
Tell them to forget it.
Bye.

1795
02:20:37,958 --> 02:20:44,249
Double happiness which you
give every time to your daughter,

1796
02:20:45,625 --> 02:20:49,249
Father's day tradition started
for great fathers like you,

1797
02:20:49,583 --> 02:20:50,957
to keep it alive,

1798
02:20:53,333 --> 02:20:54,707
it must be on your hands,

1799
02:20:54,958 --> 02:20:57,957
l said double happiness and
surprized that l'm giving just one,

1800
02:20:58,166 --> 02:21:00,040
l've already given you one,

1801
02:21:00,750 --> 02:21:01,749
your daughter!

1802
02:21:10,125 --> 02:21:13,540
Uncle, you didn't like me as a kid,

1803
02:21:14,166 --> 02:21:15,165
you don't remember, right?

1804
02:21:17,166 --> 02:21:24,332
Hello doctor, heart is missing...

1805
02:21:28,958 --> 02:21:31,165
You didn't like me then.

1806
02:21:33,333 --> 02:21:34,624
You didn't like me now.

1807
02:21:43,208 --> 02:21:49,999
l'm with you...my life in you...

1808
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:55,707
But still why this distance
between us?

1809
02:21:55,916 --> 02:21:58,832
l breath you...

1810
02:21:59,041 --> 02:22:01,832
l think about you only...

1811
02:22:02,041 --> 02:22:08,290
Though you've become me,
why am l left alone?

1812
02:22:08,541 --> 02:22:14,249
How my dear?
Past is just a dream...

1813
02:22:14,500 --> 02:22:19,457
Should l hide the truth in myself?

1814
02:22:38,333 --> 02:22:42,457
Once when l asked why are you
so affectionate on our daughter,

1815
02:22:42,708 --> 02:22:45,874
you said take it as love or
madness l don't mind,

1816
02:22:46,083 --> 02:22:47,915
do you know what l felt then?

1817
02:22:48,125 --> 02:22:50,540
l thought you madly love her.

1818
02:22:50,791 --> 02:22:52,999
That's what l've been seeing
all these years.

1819
02:22:53,250 --> 02:22:57,415
Though l'm telling you she's sad,
you're unmoved,

1820
02:22:57,666 --> 02:22:59,499
l'm surprized,

1821
02:22:59,750 --> 02:23:02,707
are you really you or not?

1822
02:23:08,625 --> 02:23:13,040
You're right Susheela, l'm not myself,

1823
02:23:14,791 --> 02:23:16,957
from the moment l met him,

1824
02:23:17,333 --> 02:23:18,874
l'm no more myself.

1825
02:23:19,083 --> 02:23:21,540
Okay. Why top talk about him now?

1826
02:23:21,791 --> 02:23:26,915
There's a bit of hypocrisy
in me, you and everyone.

1827
02:23:27,916 --> 02:23:30,082
But l didn't see it in him.

1828
02:23:30,791 --> 02:23:36,082
lf Lavanya has to agree, he knows
well that l must approve him,

1829
02:23:37,166 --> 02:23:41,957
he's clever enough to plan and
enter my good books,

1830
02:23:42,208 --> 02:23:48,749
but he never tried to
impress me till now,

1831
02:23:49,125 --> 02:23:51,540
he's as he was,

1832
02:23:51,875 --> 02:23:55,165
he showed me his mischief
and his habits,

1833
02:23:55,916 --> 02:24:00,707
with just one thought of saving
my daughter from him,

1834
02:24:01,125 --> 02:24:03,040
l donned many get ups,

1835
02:24:03,583 --> 02:24:10,624
l tried by hook or crook or
even threatened to get rid of him.

1836
02:24:10,875 --> 02:24:15,624
but in that process
l got corrupted,

1837
02:24:16,666 --> 02:24:18,624
he was always clear,

1838
02:24:20,208 --> 02:24:27,124
l filled my diary with many ideas about
my daughter's future husband,

1839
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:32,082
but he wrote it here!

1840
02:24:33,166 --> 02:24:35,207
May l tell you another great thing?

1841
02:24:36,416 --> 02:24:39,957
l always wanted to give double
happiness to my daughter.

1842
02:24:40,666 --> 02:24:44,707
But he gave me double happiness.

1843
02:24:46,416 --> 02:24:47,999
He's the right choice for our daughter.

02:24:53,750 --> 02:24:56,082
Yes daddy, we don't want him.

Don't need.

1848
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:08,415
What happened, dear?

1849
02:25:08,750 --> 02:25:12,082
Your father ponders much
before coming to a decision.

1850
02:25:13,666 --> 02:25:14,957
You don't know mummy.

1851
02:25:15,208 --> 02:25:18,999
Though he knows how much
l love my daddy,

1852
02:25:19,250 --> 02:25:21,624
he made daddy to do
a lot of dirty work.

1853
02:25:32,708 --> 02:25:34,332
Did you wash the vegetables well?

1854
02:25:34,583 --> 02:25:38,457

1855
02:25:40,083 --> 02:25:40,999
What's that?

1856
02:25:41,250 --> 02:25:45,249
Can he make you do all that?
- lt's wrong dear.

1857
02:25:47,500 --> 02:25:49,290
Get a strong coffee for daddy.

1858
02:25:50,541 --> 02:25:51,915

to return my money.

1863

l'll recover every penny with interest.

1865
02:26:07,250 --> 02:26:10,790
lf you talk about interest,
you owe me Rs.10 lakhs, uncle.

1866
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,332
Didn't get me?

1867
02:26:12,583 --> 02:26:14,874
Like you paid me money on
seeing with your daughter,

1868
02:26:15,041 --> 02:26:17,749
you paid money on learning about
your elder daughter's love,

1869
02:26:17,958 --> 02:26:19,374
to a gang of goons,

1870
02:26:19,625 --> 02:26:21,415
to get your elder married,

1871
02:26:21,666 --> 02:26:24,624

in chase at that age itself,

a lot of money, you know?

Who will repay it?

Where's my elder daughter?
Tell me how is she?

1875
02:26:31,833 --> 02:26:34,749
Your elder daughter is none
other than my sister-in-law.

1876
02:26:35,083 --> 02:26:37,624
She married my brother.
- ls it?

1877
02:26:43,083 --> 02:26:44,457
What dear?
- What did the doctor say?

1878
02:26:44,708 --> 02:26:47,457
You gave me double
happiness till now, dad,

1879
02:26:47,708 --> 02:26:49,957
now l'm going to give you
double happiness.
