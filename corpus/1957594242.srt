1
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,900
Dan: I want you to quit
your post, Jake.

2
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:33,200
I want you to take
over Metro for me.

3
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,767
Superintendent rank.

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,833
Jake: What do I know
about Metro?

5
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:37,033
If I've been out of downtown

6
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:38,167
a half dozen times
the last five years,

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,500
it's a lot.

8
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:41,867
Metro overlaps Boston,
same police power.

9
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,300
Come on Dan,

10
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:46,033
there must be a dozen captains
begging for that spot.

11
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:48,133
Last time I checked
I wasn't one of them.

12
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:49,733
What's the problem?

13
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:52,900
There's a knot of corruption
in that department so thick

14
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:55,500
I need a knife to cut it with.

15
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:58,767
A clean, sharp knife.

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,067
We're talking about deep-seated
extensive corruption, Jake,

17
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:04,300
the kind that takes a
rookie and presses him

18
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,267
into believing if you
wanna be one of the guys,

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,167
this is the only way to go.

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,633
That's why I want
you on the inside.

21
00:01:10,667 --> 00:01:12,533
Bust it up.

22
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:15,067
Any names in Metro I can use?

23
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:18,333
I'll need someone. A choirboy.

24
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:21,333
You're gonna have to
find him for yourself.

25
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:24,900
How about surveillance?
Wire taps? Backup?

26
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:28,767
Extremely low
profile, no budget.

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,300
No outside agencies.

28
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,433
Thanks a lot, Dan.

29
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,233
(drilling)

30
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:54,733
(crashing)

31
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,133
(hissing)

32
00:02:26,167 --> 00:02:27,300
(drilling)

33
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:44,600
(hissing)

34
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:07,767
(humming)

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,533
Hey! Looking good, Barry!

36
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:11,333
Thanks.

37
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:14,167
So, where's George Washington
gonna put that ax, huh?

38
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,300
Over there? Huh?

39
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:16,367
(chuckles) Yeah.

40
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,500
- (laughs)
- Are you gonna take the car?

41
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:20,067
Oh, the car...

42
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,067
I'd like to bury that car.

43
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,267
Take the wagon honey.

44
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,867
I wanna check out a
couple more trade-ins

45
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,067
on my way to work.

46
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,633
Mary: Putting
that on the market?

47
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:30,800
If I can't get my
price I'll work it out.

48
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,067
Right.

49
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,200
(dogs barking)
(birds chirping)

50
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,933
Get rid of it for
me, will ya, Frankie?

51
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:50,200
Thanks a lot, babe.

52
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:51,367
Burn it, trash it, bury it,

53
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,567
I don't care what
you do just as long

54
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,833
as it looks good
on the insurance.

55
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:57,467
Wanna get rid
of your car, huh?

56
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,200
Yeah.

57
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:01,533
We'll take care of it tonight,
no sweat.

58
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:04,467
But you're better off leaving
these in the ignition.

59
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,467
Park the pig outside
in your usual space,

60
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,800
Doogie and I will swing by
and give it the deep six.

61
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,167
But you're gonna owe me one.

62
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,133
No problem, Frankie.

63
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:13,700
What are friends for?

64
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,133
Name it.

65
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,500
Well I, uh...

66
00:04:17,533 --> 00:04:19,500
I already got something in mind.

67
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:22,400
There's this video depot
Doogie and I got cased out.

68
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:24,133
Medford video depot.

69
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:26,167
It's ripe for the slaughter.

70
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,767
Frankie, I'm one
of your biggest fans.

71
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,867
But I think you're way out
of your league on this depot.

72
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,133
They got a high
tech alarm system.

73
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,500
It's impossible.

74
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:40,667
Nah, I got an alarm man.

75
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,467
It's the real thing.

76
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,233
Benny Brown. The best in town.

77
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:45,533
Hey that rhymes!

78
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,800
Maybe we ought to make
an ad for this guy,

79
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:48,967
what do you think?

80
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:51,700
Doogie, would
you just shut up?

81
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,867
An alarm man?
Well...

82
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,167
that's a horse of
a different color.

83
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,267
But I gotta run it by Jimmy.

84
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,400
Anything this big in Medford,

85
00:04:58,433 --> 00:05:00,067
I got run it by Jimmy first.

86
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:01,133
An alarm man?

87
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:02,633
You got an alarm man and
you're gonna waste him

88
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:03,767
heisting cameras? Come on!

89
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,467
What are you talking
about waste him, huh?

90
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,067
Hey Jimmy you just passed the
video store, stop the car.

91
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:12,100
That's small potatoes.

92
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:14,100
You really got an alarm man,

93
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:15,600
this could be hot!

94
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:16,967
What are you doin'?

95
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,933
Come on guys, what's goin' on?

96
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:21,967
Hey guys, huh?

97
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:24,200
What are you stoppin' here for?

98
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,967
That's my bank.

99
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:27,433
Frankie: The
Depositor's Trust?

100
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:29,067
Jimmy: If I'm
lyin', I'm dyin'!

101
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:31,133
Frankie: (laughs) I get it.

102
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,500
A bank job, right?

103
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,200
What are you talkin' about, huh?
It's nuts!

104
00:05:36,233 --> 00:05:38,567
There's millions in the vault.

105
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,167
That place ought to be a piece
of cake for a real pro.

106
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,333
Tin can.

107
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:43,700
Hey guys, a video
store's one thing.

108
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:46,233
We been doing that
kinda heist for years.

109
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:47,367
But a bank?

110
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,567
What's the matter, Frankie?

111
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,067
Afraid of the cops?

112
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:53,167
(laughter)

113
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,567
(phone rings)

114
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,933
(chatter)
(police scanners)

115
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,933
Metro, Clemente, talk to me!

116
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,433
Third and Mason,
Third and Mason,

117
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:13,067
I can spring a
canine and a cruiser,

118
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:14,567
but I gotta have
'em back by 11:00,

119
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,100
DUI's up and down the parkway.

120
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,167
Metro, Clemente, talk to me!

121
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,633
Jimmy! How's my boy?

122
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,933
Hey Jerry. Just checking in.

123
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:25,267
I'm excited about
today's little talk.

124
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,067
Real excited.

125
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,867
That's a big 10-4 but
now's not exactly the time,

126
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,200
know what I mean, huh?

127
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:34,967
(knocking)

128
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:36,567
I gotta go. Quinn.

129
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,500
Spell me, will ya Frank?

130
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:42,967
Yeah, sure thing Captain.

131
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:46,900
- (knocking)
- Come in.

132
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:50,333
Come on, Gerry. Come on in.

133
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,867
Have a seat.

134
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,533
I've gotten word the
mob's running drugs

135
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:04,233
direct into Logan on
single engine prop planes.

136
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:06,200
You hear anything?

137
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,067
No, sir.

138
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:09,767
Narcotics is not
my chain though.

139
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,600
Yeah, I know, I know.

140
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:14,400
Well, if this running drugs
into the airport is true,

141
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:17,667
my bet is someone in the
division's on the take.

142
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,200
Nothing makes my skin crawl more

143
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,267
than the stink of a dirty cop.

144
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,300
Hmm, understandable.

145
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,667
Gerry, I'm the
new boy in town.

146
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,900
I'm gonna need all the
help I can get on this.

147
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:35,667
So, you hear anything about
the division being compromised,

148
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,633
I expect you to come
straight to me, okay?

149
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:39,767
Of course! Of course.

150
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,600
Well, I gotta be
getting back, sir,

151
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:43,267
I'm on watch.

152
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,367
Well, go! Go.

153
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,067
Thank you.

154
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,667
Forgive me, Captain Clemente,

155
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,433
for I have sinned.

156
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:50,300
Sir?

157
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,867
Here we are still
on our honeymoon,

158
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,067
and I'm asking you to
break Omertà for me.

159
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:58,567
That's the second
code of silence!

160
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,367
Is that an Italian joke, sir?

161
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,867
No Ger, it's a cop joke.

162
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,967
Huh.

163
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:07,067
Not a funny one.

164
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,467
I'll let you know
if I hear anything.

165
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,533
Good.

166
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:22,133
I expect you to.

167
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,667
Oh, no! No, not again!

168
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,233
Where's my car?
Where's my Caddy?

169
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:27,500
Did you guys see anybody?

170
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:28,633
Hey, Lieutenant!

171
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:29,733
Lieutenant!
Get Hawkins from theft.

172
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,067
- Get him up here right now!
- What's the problem?

173
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,300
The problem?
The problem is they stole my car

174
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,467
right out of the squad lot.

175
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,100
Oh, that's a real
shame, Captain.

176
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:37,433
Why don't you call
the motor pool?

177
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:38,767
Oh, you're a real comedian.

178
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,867
Everybody's a comedian.

179
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,067
What are you guys
laughing at, huh?

180
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:47,067
Clemente. What
a piece of work!

181
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,600
Dollars to donuts, he just had
that old rust bucket of his

182
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:51,367
pinched right off the lot.

183
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,200
(laughter)

184
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:57,467
What makes you say
that, Lieutenant?

185
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,067
Well, you know Gerry.

186
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:00,867
Do I?

187
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:06,067
(revving engine)

188
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:08,400
(splashing)

189
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:13,567
If I knew you guys had this
much fun on the job, Frankie,

190
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,667
I would have become
a cop myself.

191
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,367
- Get outta here!
- (laughter)

192
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,300
In this game, making
each shot is important.

193
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,767
Setting up for the next shot

194
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:30,267
is what it takes to win.

195
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,867
Your wife was very attractive.

196
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,367
Great pool player,
rest her soul.

197
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,233
Speaking of which,

198
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:41,267
I never knew you were enrolled

199
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,733
at the Jesuit
Seminary, Lieutenant.

200
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,733
That was a long time ago, sir.

201
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:49,067
Jake.

202
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:50,467
What do they say?

203
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,867
Give me the boy
until he's seven,

204
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,667
and I'll show you the man?
Something like that.

205
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,167
Yes.

206
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,233
Father killed in action.

207
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:02,767
Brother on the beat, in Quincy.

208
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,833
A regular second
generation Boston cop.

209
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:06,067
Third.

210
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,967
Third? Whew!

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,767
You got me beat by one!

212
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,233
So Paul...

213
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:18,167
what do you know about
Captain Clemente that I don't?

214
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,100
That depends on
what you know, sir.

215
00:10:20,133 --> 00:10:22,133
What I know?

216
00:10:22,167 --> 00:10:26,167
Omertà from a Jesuit?

217
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,233
Silence among thieves,

218
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:29,767
even if the thieves are cops?

219
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,567
Mea culpa, padre.

220
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,700
I think I can trust you, Paul.

221
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:52,767
So here's what I know.

222
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,267
I've been doing a
little nosing around.

223
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,333
Rumor has it that Clemente
is a legend in his own time.

224
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,633
Pulling patrol heists, TVs,

225
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:06,733
refrigerators, washer-dryers.

226
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,267
Presents for his wife, his kid.

227
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,400
Probably some other
officers involved.

228
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:14,700
But who's gonna talk
about that, huh?

229
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:17,767
Omertà?

230
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,267
You know a lot
about him then, sir.

231
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,400
I know I hate everything
that he stands for,

232
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:23,100
ever since I put on a badge.

233
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:24,400
Why don't you
take him down then?

234
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,200
I can't take him down because

235
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:29,233
I haven't got anything
hard against him.

236
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:30,600
Except what?

237
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:33,233
Beating his electric meter?

238
00:11:33,267 --> 00:11:35,933
I heard that one.

239
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,900
But when it was tipped
he busted up his box

240
00:11:37,933 --> 00:11:40,633
and said burglars broke into it.

241
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:45,100
So the choirboy can sing,
if he hears the right tune.

242
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:47,533
Gerry's dirty as sin.

243
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:50,733
He's the highest ranking
man in my department.

244
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:55,067
And it burns me I haven't got
anything hard against him.

245
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,700
This whole part of
town is compromised,

246
00:11:56,733 --> 00:11:58,467
not just by OC,

247
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,467
but by cops pulling
their own scams

248
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,467
with or without the mob.

249
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,500
He's the worst
part of that breed.

250
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:11,067
If I can bring him down,
it's gonna make an example.

251
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:18,433
Are you with me?

252
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:21,500
Or does being a cop
mean nothing to you?

253
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:22,500
That's what it comes down to,

254
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,400
nothing less than that.

255
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:28,467
People trust cops.
They ought to trust cops.

256
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Anything gets in the
way of that trust,

257
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:32,533
I'm gonna smash.

258
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:35,567
Now once again, are you with me,

259
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,900
Lieutenant?

260
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:41,633
I'm with you, sir, yes.

261
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:44,200
Good.

262
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:48,633
Now.

263
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:55,500
What do you know about
Gerry that I don't?

264
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:56,667
There's this girl.

265
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,767
What girl?

266
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,333
Kelly Sherwood.

267
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:02,867
Gerry's mistress, going
on at least three years.

268
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,900
She works bails in Revere.

269
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:07,633
I've seen his car parked outside
her house plenty of times.

270
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:10,500
- On duty?
- Most of the time.

271
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:14,400
And what's so important that
it can't wait another hour?

272
00:13:14,433 --> 00:13:16,800
Call of duty, baby.

273
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:20,600
Well just as long as it's
not the call of the wild.

274
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,333
Better not be going out on me,

275
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,100
or home to Mary.

276
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:26,100
(Gerry sighs)

277
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:27,567
Know what the
problem with you is?

278
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,700
Hmm?

279
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,600
You have no
respect for the law.

280
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:35,333
(Kelly laughs)

281
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:36,500
Oh, and you do?

282
00:13:36,533 --> 00:13:38,733
You bet. Gotta go.

283
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:39,867
Oh come on baby, stay!

284
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,200
- Baby...
- Kelly: Come on!

285
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,467
(screeching tires)

286
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,333
Busting into a bank with cops,

287
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:12,800
I mean that'd be history,

288
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,233
it'd be a first.

289
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:16,300
So what's the problem, Benny?

290
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,167
You're the problem, Captain.

291
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,433
You and the two sergeants here.

292
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,467
I mean how do I know
that this isn't a setup?

293
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,767
That wouldn't fly,
Benny me boy!

294
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,600
It's entrapment.

295
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,667
Entrapment nothin', I'm
talkin' about gettin' whacked.

296
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,400
No.

297
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:30,933
Cops or no cops,

298
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:32,500
an alarm man is always
lookin' over his shoulder

299
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:34,100
after the job.

300
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:37,500
Lone outsider brought in to
help the tight local boys.

301
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:38,733
And the local boys being cops,

302
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:41,433
well I figure the odds of me
being hit are about even money.

303
00:14:41,467 --> 00:14:45,800
Not that we'd do that, Benny.

304
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,333
Yeah. Besides,

305
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:49,167
any bank job it's risky enough.

306
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,433
Risky?

307
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:51,700
This place is a tin can!

308
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:54,367
There's millions just waiting.

309
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,367
I've been prayin' for years

310
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,433
for someone like
you to come along.

311
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:01,767
Let me tell ya
how a guy like me

312
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,833
lives long enough
to be a guy like me.

313
00:15:04,867 --> 00:15:08,433
You stay as far away
as possible from cops.

314
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:11,300
Sounds like you gotta
learn to trust cops, Benny.

315
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,467
Cops like us could
be your best friends.

316
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,100
Why should I trust you?

317
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:18,100
Because, Benny, there
are two kinds of cops.

318
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:19,867
There are honest cops,
and there are smart cops,

319
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,700
and even the honest
cops don't talk.

320
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:30,633
It's a perfect little
world out there, Benny.

321
00:15:30,667 --> 00:15:33,833
Okay. Let's just say
that I do trust ya.

322
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:37,933
(laughs) I mean I'm not
so sure that I can still

323
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:39,800
take this bank down.

324
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,567
Here's my proposal.

325
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,867
Just check the joint out,

326
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,667
and then you make your decision.

327
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,067
If it ain't
everything Jimmy says,

328
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:49,233
you can jump off the wagon,

329
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:52,800
no harm no foul.

330
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:54,167
Ah, you're a smart guy, Gerry,

331
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,567
just like they say.

332
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,400
(sighs) Okay, Captain,

333
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:02,800
so when can I see
this here tin can?

334
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,200
Jimmy: Tonight.

335
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,700
It's popcorn, a piece of cake.

336
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:38,733
Absolutely unbelievable!

337
00:16:38,767 --> 00:16:40,400
Benny's in, even splits.

338
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,300
- It's an old box.
- All right.

339
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,633
Hell of a lot of telephone
wires in there with alarm

340
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:46,533
but nothin' electrical!

341
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,333
How soon before
you can make it?

342
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:49,867
Can you get me
in an hour a shot,

343
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,767
say three times a week?

344
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,367
- Yeah.
- A month.

345
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,567
Two at the most
to beat the alarm.

346
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,133
Another week to
build a bypass box

347
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:58,667
so we can control it.

348
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,933
But, I need an inside man.

349
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,067
I need a blaster.

350
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,167
Come on, Benny!

351
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,867
Another guy to split the take?

352
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,767
Yeah, well I need
someone to blow that vault.

353
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,067
We don't beat the
vault, we get nothin'.

354
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,533
Look, I'm tight with a demo man,

355
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:16,267
Vince Brogan. He's a pro.

356
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,400
A pro that'll watch your back

357
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:19,167
against us cops, huh Benny?

358
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,067
You're reading my mind.

359
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,600
Sure okay, maybe one of my own

360
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:25,533
will make me feel a
little more comfortable.

361
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:29,467
But I do need a
blaster, that's no lie.

362
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,067
No Brogan, no Benny.

363
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:35,500
Welcome aboard, Benny.

364
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:38,367
(laughs)

365
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,233
If I'm lyin' I'm dyin'!

366
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,333
We're going scuba fishing
off the boat tomorrow.

367
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:43,933
You and Quinn?

368
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:45,733
He says he's never
done it before,

369
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:47,700
and he wants to build up
his retirement skills.

370
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,667
(laughs) You and Quinn!

371
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,100
That's something
I never figured.

372
00:17:53,133 --> 00:17:54,667
Especially now.

373
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,067
You think he's on to the bank?

374
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,067
Ah, come on!

375
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:01,800
Don't even fool,

376
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,833
don't even go in that area.

377
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:06,100
Quinn in a scuba
suit! (laughs)

378
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:09,233
Like a beached whale!
That's a picture!

379
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:10,533
I'm about to wet my pants!

380
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:17,133
I gotta hit the head.

381
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:19,367
Hey Scarzi, what do you say?

382
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,667
Hey, Ger!

383
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,667
Hey, Mr. Scarzi!

384
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,067
Got the same show this week.

385
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,100
What happened, Nick?
Sinatra cancelled again?

386
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:29,533
Sinatra? Very funny.

387
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,367
(Gerry laughs)

388
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,633
Look, I need some help.

389
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:34,933
You got a second?

390
00:18:34,967 --> 00:18:36,133
For an old friend
and choirboy?

391
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,700
Yeah. Sit down.

392
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:38,700
Thank you.

393
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:40,433
What's up?

394
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:42,100
Well I got some
trouble, you know?

395
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:44,067
There's these two guys,

396
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:46,067
dealers, pals of mine.

397
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:48,833
They got pinched by
Metro over at Wellington.

398
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:50,200
They're connected, you know?

399
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,567
Yeah.

400
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,633
Well, Ferrano
wants 'em cut loose.

401
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:55,700
(laughs) Nick!

402
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:57,500
I mean listen, this is his turf,

403
00:18:57,533 --> 00:18:59,800
we're tight and all that
happy horse manure over there,

404
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:03,200
but even he knows
I can't erase a drug bust!

405
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:05,867
I just want you to talk
to the arresting officer.

406
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,900
He's an undercover guy.

407
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:09,200
Bobby Kellogg, you know,

408
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,433
just get him to stretch things

409
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:13,267
so that these two
guys can get off.

410
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,733
Say that the bust was illegal.

411
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:20,267
Just talk to him, okay?

412
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,533
(distant sirens)

413
00:19:23,567 --> 00:19:25,533
Hey Kellogg, you got a second?

414
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,900
Captain? What's the occasion?

415
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,133
Ah, you gotta help me out
on something here, Bobby.

416
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:31,700
Yeah, sure, what?

417
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,500
That bust you made down
on Wellington yesterday.

418
00:19:33,533 --> 00:19:35,733
Oldham and Willette?

419
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,100
Did you get 'em clean?

420
00:19:37,133 --> 00:19:38,967
Yeah. Clean as a cat's tongue.

421
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:40,233
Big haul, too.

422
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:42,500
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

423
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:44,067
So who wants to know? Lawyers?

424
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,467
Eh, a friend of a friend.

425
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,833
Owns a nightclub
down on Route 1.

426
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:48,400
Real connected.

427
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,167
Anyway, he wanted me
to pass it on to you,

428
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,700
that there's a lot of real
money to be made here.

429
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:59,100
With the right kind of truth.

430
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:00,967
I spoke to Kellogg, like I said.

431
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,533
Wasn't too subtle,
but he got the hint.

432
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:06,567
No.

433
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,933
What do you want from me?

434
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:09,367
This is no good.

435
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,567
I got guys to account to
if those two guys go down.

436
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Gerry: If they go down, 
 they go down.

437
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:14,900
It happens, okay?

438
00:20:14,933 --> 00:20:16,733
They're small fry,
don't worry about it.

439
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,867
Kellogg's a square,
he won't bite.

440
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,667
Scarzi: Can't you talk 
 to him again?

441
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,867
No way!

442
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,300
What the hell's the
matter with you man?

443
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,367
Come on!
Stop giving me this grief!

444
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,000
Leave me alone,
I'm gonna go fishing.

445
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:28,867
Jake: Ah, last time
I was on a boat,

446
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,167
I don't even remember.

447
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,800
I ought to enjoy life more.

448
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:37,833
(laughs) That's right.
That's what it's for!

449
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:40,600
Hmm, right, right.

450
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:43,367
Maybe I'll get me a boat.

451
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,033
There you go.

452
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:46,867
How much does
this run you, Gerry?

453
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,133
(Gerry whistles)

454
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,600
Well, you know what
they say about a boat.

455
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:52,700
I don't know, Jake,

456
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:54,200
what do they say about a boat?

457
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:56,467
It's a hole in the water
you throw money into.

458
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,167
(Gerry chuckles)

459
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,433
What's the sense of having money

460
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,200
if you don't spend it, right?

461
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:03,467
Except if you don't have it!

462
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,300
And that's a horse
of a different color.

463
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:07,367
Yeah, I tell ya,

464
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,200
this baby keeps me skimpin'
all the way around.

465
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,433
Boston cops.

466
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:15,467
To Boston cops.

467
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,333
We always get our man.

468
00:21:17,367 --> 00:21:20,833
Oh, those are the
Mounties, Jake.

469
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:24,267
My mistake!

470
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,600
What do Boston cops get, Gerry?

471
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:29,467
Twenty-two thousand
dollars a year (laughs).

472
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,533
Good one!

473
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:33,633
To Boston cops.

474
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,467
The best cops in the world.

475
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,900
Best in the world.

476
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:45,800
And the outside lock to
the optical shop is easy.

477
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,333
I picked it last night
when I was on patrol.

478
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,867
Gerry: Went in, looked around. 
 It was beautiful.

479
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,933
The loft's got a dual 
 set of heavy-duty sockets

480
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:54,200
for grinding lenses,

481
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,833
which is right near
the wall to the bank.

482
00:21:55,867 --> 00:21:57,633
Now, that's perfect because 
 there's plenty enough juice

483
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:59,767
to handle the drills to
get us through the wall

484
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,567
into the crawl space,

485
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,300
over the vault.

486
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:07,967
The vault.

487
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:09,400
I don't know.

488
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:10,967
Vince?

489
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:12,300
It's an old baby

490
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,567
with metal rods
crisscrossing the top,

491
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,700
should make it easier on us,

492
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:17,067
but nothing's a cinch.

493
00:22:17,067 --> 00:22:18,600
We'll drill a couple of holes,

494
00:22:18,633 --> 00:22:20,433
smash through with
sledgehammers.

495
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:23,933
That doesn't work,
we use dynamite.

496
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,933
(laughs) Dynamite, huh?

497
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:30,067
- Yeah.
- What are you, nuts?

498
00:22:30,067 --> 00:22:32,300
No.

499
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:33,733
Somebody's gonna hear us.

500
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:35,967
We'll use a couple of
sandbags to muffle the sound.

501
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:37,767
Yeah, sure.

502
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,967
Listen, I'd like
three nights in there

503
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,400
over a long weekend.
You know?

504
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:41,967
Short hits in and out,

505
00:22:42,067 --> 00:22:43,900
it's worth it to
clean all the boxes.

506
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:47,567
Like some satin sheets
while you're at it?

507
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,400
Three nights.

508
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:57,133
Shouldn't be difficult.

509
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:00,300
Memorial Day weekend.

510
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:04,067
(suspense music)

511
00:23:24,967 --> 00:23:27,700
Got the name of a
pal Gerry hangs with.

512
00:23:27,733 --> 00:23:29,200
Hunting, fishing,

513
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,733
families go out together.

514
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:32,367
Everybody knows they're friends,

515
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,933
but it could go deeper.

516
00:23:33,967 --> 00:23:35,633
The guy's a sergeant
over in Medford.

517
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:36,967
Jimmy Donnelly?

518
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:38,633
You know the name?

519
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,067
Why don't you give it to me?

520
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:41,533
I just heard rumors, Jake!

521
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:42,933
I'm not gonna trash
a cop on a rumor,

522
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:46,133
not to you or anybody!

523
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,400
It's probably a
dead end anyway.

524
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:49,500
Clemente and Donnelly

525
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:51,133
are pulling penny ante
stuff together,

526
00:23:51,167 --> 00:23:52,967
fat chance of proving it.

527
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:54,067
Omertà.

528
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,967
Right. Cops don't rat on cops.

529
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,933
Even Jesuit cops!

530
00:23:57,967 --> 00:24:02,100
Sorry, sorry.

531
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:03,967
(ticking)
(beep)

532
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,833
Gentlemen,
Memorial Day weekend,

533
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:07,433
that tin can's ours.

534
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:09,067
Ha-ha! Party time!

535
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,267
Hey Doogie. Doogie, please.

536
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,967
We're outta here.

537
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:16,067
Now Vince and I'll sneak back
from Florida on the 23rd.

538
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:18,433
An out of state alibi
ain't gonna hurt.

539
00:24:18,467 --> 00:24:20,333
I mean the Feds,
they know my rep.

540
00:24:20,367 --> 00:24:22,267
I'm gonna be taking a
lot of heat for sure.

541
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,733
So remember, business as usual

542
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:27,400
the whole Memorial
Day weekend, all right?

543
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,833
Okay.

544
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:32,200
Gerry, I'm gonna
be with your wife.

545
00:24:32,233 --> 00:24:33,533
Yeah, I'm workin'.

546
00:24:33,567 --> 00:24:35,100
The more people
you see the better.

547
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:37,933
Set things up. Work and play.

548
00:24:37,967 --> 00:24:40,067
I'll go bowling.

549
00:24:40,067 --> 00:24:41,933
And you better
call Kelly, Gerry.

550
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:43,700
Before this gets out of hand...

551
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,267
Now, remember,

552
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,467
five years from now,

553
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,633
when the statute of
limitations runs out

554
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:48,733
this isn't gonna mean anything.

555
00:24:48,767 --> 00:24:53,267
But for now, this is the circle.

556
00:24:53,300 --> 00:25:00,833
Nobody gets caught,
unless somebody talks.

557
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,300
That won't happen.

558
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:04,367
No way, boss.

559
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,533
Don't look at us,

560
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:06,967
we're not gonna cross
a bunch of cops!

561
00:25:07,067 --> 00:25:09,167
(laughs) And live
to talk about it!

562
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
Get out!

563
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:12,567
Whoa, whoa.

564
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,167
We stick together
or we fall apart.

565
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,300
(snapping/clapping)

566
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,500
Understood?

567
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:35,433
I'm gonna meet some
of the guys, okay?

568
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,200
Nothing important.

569
00:25:37,233 --> 00:25:39,100
I don't like being
left alone, Gerry.

570
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:40,767
Oh baby, come on. Come on.

571
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:45,100
Give me a kiss, come on.

572
00:25:45,133 --> 00:25:51,133
There you go, see.

573
00:25:51,167 --> 00:25:53,600
(Kelly laughs)
(kissing)

574
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:35,467
Man: (over radio)
 Two to one clear.

575
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Check.

576
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:04,567
Three to one, set.

577
00:27:18,367 --> 00:27:21,500
Like buttah, like buttah!

578
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:23,367
(car door slamming)

579
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:52,067
(lock turns)

580
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:15,900
Bring it home, bring it home.

581
00:28:15,933 --> 00:28:19,967
(whispering)

582
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:24,967
Two to one,
two to one, all clear.

583
00:28:25,067 --> 00:28:27,067
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Come on!

584
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,133
Let's go!

585
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:15,233
(drilling)

586
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:20,233
(drilling)

587
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:26,467
(drilling)

588
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,667
(crashing)

589
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,400
One to two, one to two.

590
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:43,967
Go ahead.

591
00:29:44,067 --> 00:29:46,267
Popcorn.

592
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,367
Yeah!

593
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,700
(swooshing)

594
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,300
Ready!

595
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:22,267
(drilling)

596
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:46,267
(smashing)

597
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,567
Benny: Forget about it!

598
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,367
This ain't working Benny!

599
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,933
Okay, I'm gonna
have to blow it.

600
00:30:50,967 --> 00:30:52,967
Vinny.

601
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,567
This is gonna do it,
right, Vin?

602
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,667
Gerry, relax.

603
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,933
Move, move!

604
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:15,833
(explosion)
(rumbling)

605
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,100
One to two, one to two,

606
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,067
come in.

607
00:31:26,067 --> 00:31:30,567
Two to one, all clear.

608
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,567
Popcorn!

609
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,467
(sizzling)

610
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,233
(cheering)

611
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,367
(crashing)

612
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:52,933
(rumbling)

613
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:00,667
(shouting)

614
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,767
Let's go boys, let's do this!

615
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:10,667
(hissing)

616
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,900
Talk to me, Frankie,
how's it going?

617
00:32:22,933 --> 00:32:24,067
Come on down.

618
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:35,267
Whoa! Hello there, lass!

619
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,267
Come on, baby!

620
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:40,533
Give it to me now!

621
00:32:40,567 --> 00:32:42,267
(banging)

622
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,300
Come on!

623
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:46,367
Let me do the lock.

624
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,067
(clunk)

625
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,567
Yo! Whoa!

626
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,067
Oh, no! No!
(screams in frustration)

627
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:56,633
What? What?

628
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:58,167
Look at it!
Jimmy's off, there's nothin',

629
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,300
next to nothin' in here!

630
00:32:59,333 --> 00:33:01,267
Let me see, shut up!

631
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,367
Read 'em and weep.
60 bundles, 1000 on a band,

632
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,800
numbers don't lie, pal!

633
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:07,333
Lousy $10,000 each!

634
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:09,433
Oh, yeah. Jimmy says
there's gonna be millions.

635
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:11,300
Sure, yeah. Cops!

636
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:12,633
You're supposed
to know something!

637
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,533
I thought you were smart, Gerry!

638
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:15,400
Hey!

639
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:17,067
- Man 1: No, no.
- Man 2: Gerry. Gerry!

640
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,700
Come on! Come on!

641
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:23,067
Okay, all right.
(yelling)

642
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,200
Now listen, there's
still plenty of boxes here.

643
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:26,300
We'll just dump 'em!

644
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:27,467
Let's just keep going!

645
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,933
Yeah?
You're wastin' your time!

646
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:30,633
Shut up!
(arguing)

647
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:32,767
Quiet! Quiet! Jimmy!

648
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,333
Jimmy: Two to one, 
 come in.

649
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:36,367
Let's move.
It's gettin' light.

650
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,733
Jimmy: We'll come 
 back tonight.

651
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:38,767
No way.

652
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,200
- Benny!
- Yeah, sure.

653
00:33:40,233 --> 00:33:42,400
I should have--

654
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:49,767
(slamming)

655
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:04,900
(sigh) We going back for the
rest of the boxes, Benny?

656
00:34:04,933 --> 00:34:06,900
You guys can do what you want.

657
00:34:06,933 --> 00:34:08,800
You think there's anything
there, that's fine.

658
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:10,400
I'm not taking the risk.

659
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:11,767
Let's just divvy up,

660
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,933
each stash his own,

661
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,133
and we'll call it quits,
all right?

662
00:34:14,167 --> 00:34:16,067
Vince: Hey, look at this!

663
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,067
There's over $100,000 here.

664
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,667
Yeah!

665
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,933
And this.

666
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:24,067
Whoa!

667
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:26,133
- Whoa!
- The boxes!

668
00:34:26,167 --> 00:34:27,900
I knew it was in the boxes!

669
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:29,233
Wait a second, wait a second!

670
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,467
This is real good stuff!

671
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Vince!

672
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:38,467
Nice!

673
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,333
Vince: Look at this, look!

674
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:41,067
How many boxes are left?

675
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,267
Eight, 900 more!

676
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,233
We're going back.

677
00:34:45,267 --> 00:34:47,367
(clanging)

678
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,467
Come on, how much?
Close to a million cash!

679
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,400
- Yes!
- Jimmy!

680
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:10,700
(laughter)

681
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:12,533
But it's nothing
compared to this.

682
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:15,467
These pink diamonds here
alone are worth $2 million.

683
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,867
Get outta here!

684
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,200
Pop the gems out,
melt down the gold,

685
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:21,433
another million, two easy, huh?

686
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:24,267
Rest of the boxes,
eight million, $10 million.

687
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,600
Vince, I've never seen such
big stuff in one place, huh?

688
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:29,967
With what, maybe 300
more boxes to go?

689
00:35:30,067 --> 00:35:33,533
Who knows?

690
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:35,400
Where the hell did
all this come from?

691
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:38,433
Who cares?
It's ours now, huh?

692
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:39,733
If it's the mob's,
they'll care.

693
00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:40,867
Yeah, right.

694
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,100
Enough of them
live in this town,

695
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:44,167
Winters, Ferraro...

696
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,933
This could be theirs
laundered into gems.

697
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:48,767
I'll check it out
with Ferraro.

698
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,067
Either way, a hit
this big in his turf,

699
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,233
he's gonna want a cut.

700
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:53,200
I figure at least
$1 million easy.

701
00:35:53,233 --> 00:35:54,767
A million, what are you nuts?

702
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,633
I hate cuttin'
those bastards in!

703
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:59,633
Well, it's either that
or we get our legs cut off.

704
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,767
Benny, if anything's
fenced you make tribute

705
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,767
right off the top.

706
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,067
Yeah, I'll take care of it.

707
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:07,333
But I gotta get down to Florida
tonight and salt my alibi.

708
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:10,400
So you give my share
of the cash part to Vince.

709
00:36:10,433 --> 00:36:12,800
Everybody's responsible
for his own cash splits.

710
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:15,400
You burn it, you bury it
in the basement, whatever.

711
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:16,633
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

712
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:17,867
What are we gonna do
with all this jewelry

713
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,533
in the meantime, huh?

714
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:23,733
I mean this here,
this is the haul, huh?

715
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:25,800
So? What's it gonna be?

716
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,233
I'll look after it!

717
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:28,300
Oh, Doogie, just forget it.

718
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:32,600
Forget about it.
(laughter)

719
00:36:32,633 --> 00:36:37,867
What's it gonna be, Ger?

720
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,933
You take care of
the stones, Benny.

721
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:42,067
After all, you're
gonna be the one

722
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:49,967
who's gonna be
fencin' 'em, right?

723
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:53,833
After all, if you can't
trust the alarm man,

724
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:55,300
who can you trust?

725
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:58,367
(laughs) This is a switch, huh?

726
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,767
(laughter)

727
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,067
Sure.
Okay, I'll hold all the gems.

728
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:04,200
Vince, you get
tomorrow's beauties

729
00:37:04,233 --> 00:37:05,667
down to me in Miami.

730
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,667
Look, as I sell them off,

731
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,267
I'll keep in touch with Frank.

732
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,833
Everybody get's
their share. Okay?

733
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:12,167
When we get the cash,
we'll mix it in

734
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,767
with the rest of the haul.

735
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,067
And remember, no spending,

736
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,433
no flashing
until the heat's off.

737
00:37:21,467 --> 00:37:24,267
Even if we have to wait the
whole five years of the statute,

738
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,100
we lay low.

739
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:29,700
And then, bingo.

740
00:37:29,733 --> 00:37:31,267
(crashing)

741
00:37:45,833 --> 00:37:46,967
(laughter)

742
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:48,633
With what we got last night,

743
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:51,533
I bet we got 20,
maybe $25 million!

744
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:53,333
Twenty-five!
Oh, my God!

745
00:37:53,367 --> 00:37:54,733
(laughs) Oh, mother of pearl!

746
00:37:54,767 --> 00:37:56,067
Shut up, Doogie.
Shut up.

747
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:57,767
Twenty-five million dollars!

748
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,167
This is bigger than Brink's!

749
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,200
Brink's, that was
a lousy 1.2 me boy.

750
00:38:03,233 --> 00:38:04,467
Twenty-five mil!

751
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,667
that's twice as much as
the great train robbery!

752
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,800
And that, gentlemen,

753
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:12,067
makes it the biggest
job of all time!

754
00:38:12,067 --> 00:38:20,567
All: Yeah!
(screaming in celebration)

755
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,433
Thank you, Benny!

756
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:42,067
(police sirens)

757
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:45,500
(reporters' chatter)

758
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:47,467
All right, let me through!

759
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,300
Let me through!
No comment!

760
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,767
Let him through!

761
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,967
Back away now!

762
00:38:55,067 --> 00:39:02,467
Everything's okay! Back off!

763
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,500
- Jake: Ted!
- Mother of God!

764
00:39:05,533 --> 00:39:08,800
Jake: You got that right!

765
00:39:08,833 --> 00:39:11,433
Manager said
that they wiped the vault

766
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:13,400
and the boxes clean.

767
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:17,767
Could be millions.

768
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,067
Local yokel time.

769
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,167
Gosh, Ted!

770
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,067
I wonder what happened here?

771
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,367
The roof fall in, you think?

772
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,133
Hall Phillips, Federal Bureau.

773
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:27,333
Jack Burton.

774
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:30,300
I'm Captain Davis,
Medford Police.

775
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,567
Oh, Jake Quinn.

776
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,900
Superintendent Metro
District Commission.

777
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:36,967
We overlap Medford on this.

778
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:38,433
So what do we got?

779
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:39,600
Well what we have so far,

780
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:42,333
are no clues and big problems.

781
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:44,133
The gang spent
the whole weekend here

782
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:46,067
and they wiped it clean.

783
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,700
All three nights?

784
00:39:47,733 --> 00:39:49,233
That took guts.

785
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:50,867
They must have figured
they couldn't get hit.

786
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,267
Any noise on patrol?

787
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,233
Nah. No alarm, nothin'.

788
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:55,433
Who was the walking man?

789
00:39:55,467 --> 00:39:56,833
We'll get to that.

790
00:39:56,867 --> 00:39:59,067
First we want a soup
to nuts forensic in this vault.

791
00:39:59,067 --> 00:40:00,467
Every loose piece gets bagged.

792
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,033
What about the bill
wrappers and serial numbers?

793
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:06,100
Get 'em. Put 'em
over the wire ASAP.

794
00:40:06,133 --> 00:40:10,700
(phone ringing)

795
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:12,167
Who was on patrol, Teddy?

796
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,100
Last night?
Jimmy Donnelly.

797
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:24,600
Look, somebody drops
a dime that the cops

798
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:26,667
did the Depositor's Trust.

799
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,133
We don't go off half-cocked.

800
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:30,600
Who knows how deep it runs?

801
00:40:30,633 --> 00:40:33,133
Meaning you
checked me out first.

802
00:40:33,167 --> 00:40:34,300
Meaning I followed procedure

803
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,000
and ran an official
profile on you.

804
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:40,400
Sit down.

805
00:40:40,433 --> 00:40:43,367
Who said it was cops?

806
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,567
Nick Scarzi, local OC.

807
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,333
He's just testing the
waters with this tidbit

808
00:40:47,367 --> 00:40:48,900
and wants us to
pony up $500 grand

809
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:50,700
before he'll tell us
what else he knows.

810
00:40:50,733 --> 00:40:53,000
Scarzi? First off,
he's not mob.

811
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,167
He's an errand boy.

812
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,567
A nightclub owner.
Strictly small time.

813
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,300
You'd actually pay
him 500 large ones?

814
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,833
Money's not an issue
if Scarzi's gonna give us

815
00:41:01,867 --> 00:41:03,600
the Depositor's Trust.

816
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:05,467
Did Scarzi tell you
that Jimmy Donnelly,

817
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,233
the walking man in
Medford that night,

818
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:10,200
is pals
with a certain somebody?

819
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:12,133
Like I told ya, Scarzi's
not gonna play ball with us

820
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,867
until we do a deal with him.

821
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,167
That certain somebody
I followed up elsewhere.

822
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,967
Gerry Clemente.

823
00:41:20,067 --> 00:41:21,833
(phone rings)

824
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:23,500
- Yeah?
- Gerry. Nick Scarzi.

825
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:24,933
They're after me.

826
00:41:24,967 --> 00:41:27,200
- Who?
- The mob! That's who!

827
00:41:27,233 --> 00:41:28,533
What are you talkin' about?

828
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:30,233
Scarzi: 'Cause I know 
 about you and Jimmy.

829
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:33,733
Come on, Jimmy's been talkin' 
 for years about his bank,

830
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:35,167
doin' the bank.

831
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,467
They want their dough!

832
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,300
You know it's theirs!

833
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:40,067
I don't know anything
about any bank.

834
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:41,100
Come on, man.
They know!

835
00:41:41,133 --> 00:41:42,133
You know something?

836
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,467
They got photographs,
they got folders,

837
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,267
they got stuff on your life.

838
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,200
They got a whole profile.

839
00:41:49,233 --> 00:41:50,900
A profile.

840
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:52,633
Scarzi: They put a hood 
 over my head,

841
00:41:52,667 --> 00:41:53,700
they took me for a ride.

842
00:41:53,733 --> 00:41:56,333
I thought I was finished.
I thought I was gonzo!

843
00:41:56,367 --> 00:42:00,067
They got an ice pick.
They cut me real bad.

844
00:42:00,067 --> 00:42:02,067
(sigh)
I wasn't involved, Nick.

845
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:07,633
Scarzi: They just call me 
 tomorrow at noon, at my place.

846
00:42:07,667 --> 00:42:11,667
I'll call you.

847
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,767
- (sighs)
- (knocking)

848
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:18,300
Captain Gerald Clemente?

849
00:42:18,333 --> 00:42:19,567
Yeah, that's right.

850
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,067
Hal Phillips, Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

851
00:42:21,067 --> 00:42:22,767
This is my partner, Jack Burton.

852
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,333
We're here in connection
with the burglary

853
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:25,967
of the Depositor's Trust
in Medford

854
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:27,600
over the Memorial Day weekend.

855
00:42:27,633 --> 00:42:28,967
Like to ask you a couple
of questions about it,

856
00:42:29,067 --> 00:42:30,433
if that's all right.

857
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,333
Yeah, sure, sure.
Come on in, guys.

858
00:42:32,367 --> 00:42:36,600
(children giggling)

859
00:42:36,633 --> 00:42:39,600
(door squeaking)

860
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:42,600
Can I get you guys some coffee?

861
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:44,067
Something to drink?
Some soda?

862
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:46,267
No, thanks.

863
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,800
Captain Clemente,

864
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:50,367
the law requires that we tell
you that you're a suspect

865
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,433
in the burglary.

866
00:42:52,467 --> 00:42:53,767
On what grounds?

867
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,433
We're not at liberty to say.

868
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:58,067
Oh, should I be
talking to a lawyer?

869
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,700
(laughs)

870
00:42:59,733 --> 00:43:00,933
We can't advise you on that.

871
00:43:00,967 --> 00:43:04,367
That's strictly
your own decision.

872
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,567
I didn't have anything
to do with this, guys.

873
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,667
You're not under arrest,

874
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,167
and no arrest is anticipated.

875
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,067
We'd just like to ask
you a couple questions.

876
00:43:11,067 --> 00:43:13,133
Sure, shoot.

877
00:43:13,167 --> 00:43:16,067
Can you account
for your whereabouts

878
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:18,067
Memorial Day weekend?

879
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:23,067
(sighs) MDC Friday night
shift into Saturday morning...

880
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,400
slept back here and
worked on my boat

881
00:43:25,433 --> 00:43:27,733
down at the marina. That's it.

882
00:43:27,767 --> 00:43:32,800
We'd like it in a
little more detail.

883
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:38,700
Okay. Well, look.

884
00:43:38,733 --> 00:43:42,533
Can I keep this between us?

885
00:43:42,567 --> 00:43:45,800
You know, off the record?

886
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:48,200
Go ahead.

887
00:43:48,233 --> 00:43:52,400
But don't waltz us around.

888
00:43:52,433 --> 00:43:54,200
That weekend,
like most weekends,

889
00:43:54,233 --> 00:43:58,067
I spent with a friend,

890
00:43:58,067 --> 00:43:59,133
you know what I mean?

891
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:01,333
The FBI? Maybe a grand jury?

892
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:03,267
Gerry, what do you
expect me to say?

893
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,967
I don't know the exact times

894
00:44:05,067 --> 00:44:07,600
that you were here those nights!

895
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:14,133
How do I know you
didn't do that bank job?

896
00:44:14,167 --> 00:44:15,333
'Cause I'm
tellin' ya I didn't,

897
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:17,800
that's why.

898
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:19,600
Now listen.
Just tell them

899
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:22,633
that I was here.

900
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:24,467
And that I stayed
until the morning.

901
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:27,367
Okay?

902
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,067
You think I'm looking
forward to having this

903
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,600
out in the open, huh?

904
00:44:30,633 --> 00:44:36,200
I had to tell the FBI the truth.

905
00:44:36,233 --> 00:44:40,333
As nasty as it is.

906
00:44:40,367 --> 00:44:42,167
Well, thanks a lot!

907
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,067
Baby, come on.

908
00:44:44,067 --> 00:44:45,300
You're my legit alibi!

909
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:49,767
Anything else
would be suspicious.

910
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,100
By the way,

911
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:54,667
Mary's gonna love
hearing about this.

912
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,533
Oh, now it's poor Mary, huh?

913
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:59,733
Gerry, how's the divorce
coming along?

914
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:03,267
Baby, this is not the time!

915
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,067
It's never the right time.

916
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:07,533
Hey, come on now.

917
00:45:07,567 --> 00:45:09,833
Come on.

918
00:45:09,867 --> 00:45:12,467
Do this for me, okay?

919
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,967
Okay, baby?

920
00:45:14,067 --> 00:45:15,767
- Say yes.
- Yes.

921
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,900
Give me a kiss. Big kiss.

922
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:24,400
Big kiss.

923
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:25,700
Want a beer?

924
00:45:25,733 --> 00:45:29,400
No.

925
00:45:29,433 --> 00:45:30,800
Confidential sources 
 believe the vault

926
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:32,800
may have contained millions 
 of dollars in mob money,

927
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:35,300
which would make it the largest
 bank robbery in history.

928
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:36,633
Gerry! Get in here, quick!

929
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:37,700
According to 
 authorized sources...

930
00:45:37,733 --> 00:45:38,900
- What's up, babe?
 - ...the immediate suspicion

931
00:45:38,933 --> 00:45:40,067
has focused on a police officer.

932
00:45:40,067 --> 00:45:41,100
Look! It's your house!

933
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:42,767
A captain on the 
 Metropolitan Police Force

934
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,200
with reputed connections
to underworld figures...

935
00:45:45,233 --> 00:45:48,700
That's my house, creep!
Who the hell needs a name?

936
00:45:48,733 --> 00:45:50,933
Find out who did this
I'm gonna kill him!

937
00:45:50,967 --> 00:45:53,200
I didn't see who ran
me off the road, Dad!

938
00:45:53,233 --> 00:45:54,467
Yeah.

939
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,867
They came up from behind!

940
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,667
I don't know,
maybe it was an accident!

941
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:01,067
That was no damn accident!

942
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,400
Look, whoever is leaking
these lies about me

943
00:46:04,433 --> 00:46:06,967
has got the mob convinced
that I took their cash.

944
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:09,233
Or didn't make tribute!

945
00:46:09,267 --> 00:46:10,367
Well, what's tribute?

946
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,967
Forget about that, okay?

947
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:13,167
- Here, keep this on.
- Ow!

948
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,567
Tight!

949
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,267
- Tell me, Gerry.
- What?

950
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,433
Don't give me "What?".

951
00:46:19,467 --> 00:46:20,933
Everybody in this
town knows "what"!

952
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:22,900
- The bank!
- Mary!

953
00:46:22,933 --> 00:46:24,433
Don't lie to me, Gerry.

954
00:46:24,467 --> 00:46:27,500
Tell me!
What's it gonna take?

955
00:46:27,533 --> 00:46:30,067
What is it gonna take
to get the truth?

956
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:31,567
One of us getting killed?

957
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,233
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.

958
00:46:33,267 --> 00:46:34,667
Come here baby, come here.

959
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,267
Come here, come here.

960
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:40,167
That's it. That's it.

961
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,300
I swear to God I didn't
have anything to do

962
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,367
with that bank job.

963
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,967
I'm a cop.

964
00:46:46,067 --> 00:46:48,067
And the mob's after
my kid for no reason.

965
00:46:48,067 --> 00:46:48,967
(glass breaking)
(Mary screams)

966
00:46:49,067 --> 00:46:51,100
Get down!
Hey! Hey!

967
00:46:51,133 --> 00:46:52,067
(gun cock click)

968
00:46:52,067 --> 00:46:54,833
Come on! Hey! Hey!

969
00:46:54,867 --> 00:46:59,533
Hey! Hey!
Come on, come on.

970
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:02,600
- Hey! Hey!
- Mary: Gerry, no!

971
00:47:02,633 --> 00:47:03,800
- Come on I'll take one of you--
- No, stop! Please!

972
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:05,133
Get inside!

973
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:06,900
- Get inside!
- Mary: Stop!

974
00:47:06,933 --> 00:47:08,467
Please, please!

975
00:47:12,867 --> 00:47:15,167
(sirens)
(honking)

976
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:19,400
I wanna go
after the Feds, Jake.

977
00:47:19,433 --> 00:47:21,400
Uh-huh, that's right.

978
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:23,067
They come to my neighborhood,

979
00:47:23,067 --> 00:47:24,133
they come to my house,

980
00:47:24,167 --> 00:47:25,633
they bother my family.

981
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:27,733
I'm a police captain,
for crying out loud

982
00:47:27,767 --> 00:47:28,767
and they do this!

983
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,467
Oh, yeah, my wife,
she can't even go out

984
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,067
in the neighborhood anymore,
Jake!

985
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,500
The mob tried to kill my kid!

986
00:47:33,533 --> 00:47:39,333
Yeah, and they're buying
into this setup real good.

987
00:47:39,367 --> 00:47:41,067
What can I do to help, Gerry?

988
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,833
Anything. Name it!

989
00:47:42,867 --> 00:47:47,267
(sighs) Well, naturally,
I came to you first,

990
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,167
to see if I could
straighten things out.

991
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,433
Jake, I swear to God,

992
00:47:52,467 --> 00:47:54,500
I'm completely innocent
on this thing.

993
00:47:54,533 --> 00:47:56,067
You gotta help me.

994
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:58,400
Okay.

995
00:47:58,433 --> 00:48:01,200
Look, you got 40 days
vacation coming.

996
00:48:01,233 --> 00:48:03,300
I want you to take it,
for your sake.

997
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:05,100
You need the break.

998
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:09,167
As far as the department goes,

999
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,067
I think it better if the Feds
just think I'm standin' still.

1000
00:48:14,067 --> 00:48:15,967
Don't stand still.
Get into it.

1001
00:48:16,067 --> 00:48:17,800
Go after them for harassment.

1002
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:20,167
There's nothin' to
go after them with!

1003
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,067
You need proof
to press harassment,

1004
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,100
not just leak some rumors!

1005
00:48:26,133 --> 00:48:29,633
Take a 40 day fast, Gerry.

1006
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:31,667
It's for the best!

1007
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,900
Look, I'm on your side here.

1008
00:48:34,933 --> 00:48:37,433
Right now, it looks
like I'm the only one.

1009
00:48:37,467 --> 00:48:38,467
Trust me!

1010
00:48:47,067 --> 00:48:49,267
(spraying)

1011
00:49:03,667 --> 00:49:07,700
Oh. Mastermind
of Depositor's Trust

1012
00:49:07,733 --> 00:49:09,567
finally pays me a visit.

1013
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,200
I didn't mastermind
anything, Mr. Ferrara.

1014
00:49:13,233 --> 00:49:16,533
Mr. Ferrara.

1015
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:19,400
Don't go too far with the
dog and pony show, Gerry.

1016
00:49:19,433 --> 00:49:20,700
Doesn't suit you.

1017
00:49:20,733 --> 00:49:22,833
I tell you it wasn't my idea.

1018
00:49:22,867 --> 00:49:24,600
That's what you'd
like everybody to think,

1019
00:49:24,633 --> 00:49:25,733
even your partners.

1020
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:27,067
I work like that.

1021
00:49:27,067 --> 00:49:28,767
It's a good thing to
keep in the background,

1022
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,867
still pull the strings.

1023
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,100
That's a smart thing.

1024
00:49:31,133 --> 00:49:32,700
What's not so smart,

1025
00:49:32,733 --> 00:49:35,633
is you not paying me tribute.

1026
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:36,933
Excuse me?

1027
00:49:36,967 --> 00:49:38,233
Not for nothin',

1028
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:41,100
but my alarm man
paid off from Florida.

1029
00:49:41,133 --> 00:49:43,067
I haven't seen a dime, Gerry.

1030
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:46,933
Why?

1031
00:49:46,967 --> 00:49:50,300
I don't know, I...

1032
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:52,700
I have to get in touch
with my man.

1033
00:49:52,733 --> 00:49:54,800
I'm not in contact with him.

1034
00:49:54,833 --> 00:49:56,667
That's not so smart.

1035
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,567
Should keep a tighter
rein on your people.

1036
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,200
Somebody could get hurt.

1037
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:03,800
I'm givin' it to you straight.

1038
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:05,267
I know what's bothering you.

1039
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,067
You got a lot more out of
the bank than you expected

1040
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,633
and had your boys worried.

1041
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:10,967
You've been thinkin' maybe
some of it belonged to me.

1042
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,967
Did cross my mind, yes.
(clears throat)

1043
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,433
Relax.
It was a clean score.

1044
00:50:15,467 --> 00:50:17,267
None of it was mine.

1045
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,500
Just want my cut,

1046
00:50:18,533 --> 00:50:20,200
you'll have nothing
to worry about.

1047
00:50:20,233 --> 00:50:22,167
What about Nick Scarzi, huh?

1048
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,133
He tells me that you're
threatening to put an ice pick

1049
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:26,000
in his head
unless I pay him off.

1050
00:50:26,033 --> 00:50:27,133
Scarzi's nothing.

1051
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,867
My boys tell me the only
ones giving him a hard time

1052
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,533
are the Feds.

1053
00:50:32,567 --> 00:50:34,600
Scarzi's disappeared?

1054
00:50:34,633 --> 00:50:36,300
I thought he was supposed
to be under your wing?

1055
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:38,000
We never did a deal with him.

1056
00:50:38,033 --> 00:50:39,833
Scarzi's a loose cannon.

1057
00:50:39,867 --> 00:50:41,000
If he's squeezing Clemente,

1058
00:50:41,033 --> 00:50:43,967
he's doin' it
on his own. Dammit.

1059
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,467
Listen.
(phone ringing)

1060
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,600
I'm as frustrated by this
case as you are, Phillips.

1061
00:50:47,633 --> 00:50:49,167
Believe me. Let me clue you.

1062
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,233
Washington's not gonna
wanna be at the table

1063
00:50:51,267 --> 00:50:53,067
if the grand jury
comes up craps.

1064
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,400
Once this case goes south,

1065
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:56,500
you'll be packing up
this show in a week!

1066
00:50:56,533 --> 00:50:58,600
Tell me something
I don't know.

1067
00:50:58,633 --> 00:51:00,167
Look, I don't
know about you guys,

1068
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,633
But I've been takin'
some serious heat.

1069
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:02,867
I'm still on parole.

1070
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,200
Feds are watching every move.

1071
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:05,300
The way things are now,

1072
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:08,567
I can't even get to the jewels!

1073
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,067
Did you pay
tribute to Ferrara?

1074
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,333
Oh, yeah, a lot of laughs.

1075
00:51:11,367 --> 00:51:13,833
It's suicide to try to
move anything right now.

1076
00:51:13,867 --> 00:51:15,500
It's just too hot!

1077
00:51:15,533 --> 00:51:16,967
Yeah?

1078
00:51:17,067 --> 00:51:18,333
Well it's gonna get a
hell of a lot hotter

1079
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:21,867
if we don't see ours soon.

1080
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:22,933
All it takes, Frank,

1081
00:51:22,967 --> 00:51:24,133
is just one little thing,

1082
00:51:24,167 --> 00:51:25,567
a ring, a watch, to
fall in the wrong hands.

1083
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,700
And bang!
We're nailed.

1084
00:51:28,733 --> 00:51:32,067
Look, you can't be
too careful moving it.

1085
00:51:32,067 --> 00:51:34,733
Now look, just as soon as
the Feds are off my back,

1086
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:37,733
I'll get down to some business.
I promise.

1087
00:51:37,767 --> 00:51:40,600
You promise, huh?

1088
00:51:40,633 --> 00:51:43,933
Benny, I got somethin'
I wanna show you.

1089
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:52,100
(sniffing)

1090
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:04,067
This is an interesting
piece, isn't it?

1091
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:06,467
It's just somethin' I picked up.

1092
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,067
(clicking)

1093
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,167
What do you think, Benny?

1094
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,433
Come on Gerry, come on!

1095
00:52:11,467 --> 00:52:13,467
I don't deserve this!

1096
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,400
I think he gets the point,
Frankie.

1097
00:52:26,267 --> 00:52:27,533
(snap)

1098
00:52:27,567 --> 00:52:30,067
That's it?

1099
00:52:30,067 --> 00:52:33,367
That's all the FBI has
on the good Captain?

1100
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,967
It's not much.

1101
00:52:36,067 --> 00:52:39,267
What have you got on him?

1102
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:44,467
Departmental misconduct
with an on duty affair.

1103
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,600
That's it.

1104
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:47,833
Jake: I'm looking for
bigger things.

1105
00:52:47,867 --> 00:52:49,533
Payoffs, kickbacks, bribery.

1106
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:52,067
But no other cops
have come forward yet

1107
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:55,133
to corroborate the
kind of stuff I need.

1108
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,833
What you need for what, Jake?

1109
00:52:56,867 --> 00:52:58,833
To bust Clemente
down and take his bars.

1110
00:52:58,867 --> 00:53:00,167
That's the only way
I'm gonna put him

1111
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,733
and the rest of his gang in jail

1112
00:53:01,767 --> 00:53:03,800
for the Depositor's Trust.

1113
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:05,400
How does that follow?

1114
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:09,267
I've got Gerry thinking I'm
the only one he can trust.

1115
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,400
On that score, I wanna
keep him spinning so fast

1116
00:53:11,433 --> 00:53:14,100
he doesn't know where
I'm coming from.

1117
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:15,267
Here's the tactic.

1118
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,833
I sucker him in close, get some
cops to break omertà.

1119
00:53:17,867 --> 00:53:21,800
then put pressure on
Gerry until he cracks.

1120
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:24,267
According to the Feds, there
had to be four to five guys

1121
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:27,467
including Clemente,
inside the bank.

1122
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,067
Smart guys,
and moreover, tight.

1123
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,433
Gerry's the pin, the glue
that holds them together.

1124
00:53:32,467 --> 00:53:34,767
I wanna keep the heat on him.

1125
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,067
I bust him down,
I loosen the glue,

1126
00:53:37,067 --> 00:53:40,667
I loosen the glue,
I get the gang.

1127
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,067
Gerry, I hate to
keep harping on this,

1128
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:53,100
but Commissioner Kirkland
still wants you in

1129
00:53:53,133 --> 00:53:55,533
for a polygraph on
the Depositor's Trust.

1130
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:56,733
Kirkland? That suit?

1131
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:58,333
You're on the line, you should
be able to hold him off.

1132
00:53:58,367 --> 00:54:02,067
Gerry, the man's all over me!

1133
00:54:02,067 --> 00:54:07,333
All right Jake... I'll do it.

1134
00:54:07,367 --> 00:54:09,867
But it's a no-win deal.
I don't trust those things.

1135
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,367
I'm going in there
involuntarily,

1136
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,200
so they can't
hold it against me.

1137
00:54:15,233 --> 00:54:17,233
You have to sign this.

1138
00:54:17,267 --> 00:54:19,567
You can get an attorney,
if you want one.

1139
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,567
Attorney?
You sound like the Feds!

1140
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,933
Gimme a break!
Give me a break.

1141
00:54:26,967 --> 00:54:28,067
You want an attorney?

1142
00:54:28,067 --> 00:54:29,167
You can have one.
That's all.

1143
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,333
I'm just trying
to help you out!

1144
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:38,567
(police sirens in the distance)

1145
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,667
This is on for tomorrow!

1146
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,367
How am I gonna get an attorney?

1147
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,567
What's that gonna look like?

1148
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,433
This is nuts.

1149
00:54:45,467 --> 00:54:46,767
If they've got enough evidence,

1150
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,400
why not the hell
just indict me?

1151
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:49,767
Answer me that, huh?

1152
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,100
I can't.

1153
00:54:51,133 --> 00:54:53,667
Look, look, look!

1154
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:55,800
Take the test.

1155
00:54:55,833 --> 00:54:57,700
It'll clear the air!

1156
00:54:57,733 --> 00:54:59,300
What's the problem?

1157
00:54:59,333 --> 00:55:00,800
The problem is,

1158
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:04,067
that I expected a lot more
support from the department.

1159
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:07,267
The problem, Jake,

1160
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:11,400
is that I expected a
lot more from you, okay?

1161
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:17,800
I do what I can, Gerry.

1162
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:19,333
Here.

1163
00:55:19,367 --> 00:55:22,333
(heavy breathing)

1164
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:36,767
Gerry, I'm telling you that
somebody is watching my house!

1165
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,867
Will you stop it Kelly,
this is ridiculous.

1166
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:40,267
I'm a cop, this is
what I do for a living.

1167
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,400
I would know all this.

1168
00:55:41,433 --> 00:55:44,833
Here, see? Nothin'.

1169
00:55:44,867 --> 00:55:47,333
- Gerry, I'm scared!
- Gerry: No need.

1170
00:55:47,367 --> 00:55:50,100
Gerry, I'm not lying!
Why would I lie?

1171
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:53,933
Maybe because
you miss me, baby.

1172
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:55,767
Did you ever think of that?

1173
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,533
- (Kelly sighs)
- There's my baby.

1174
00:55:57,567 --> 00:56:00,967
Well, maybe just a little.

1175
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:04,300
That's my girl.

1176
00:56:04,333 --> 00:56:05,600
That's my baby.

1177
00:56:05,633 --> 00:56:08,100
You know, maybe I haven't
seen as much of you

1178
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:10,800
as I've wanted to
since this leave.

1179
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:12,967
Well, that's easily remedied.

1180
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:14,500
Oh, baby! Oh!

1181
00:56:24,867 --> 00:56:28,500
Gerry! Look!

1182
00:56:28,533 --> 00:56:32,200
Cops!

1183
00:56:32,233 --> 00:56:35,133
Hey! Hey, come here!

1184
00:56:35,167 --> 00:56:36,400
(squealing tires)

1185
00:56:36,433 --> 00:56:37,700
Come on! Come here!

1186
00:56:37,733 --> 00:56:39,533
Come here, ya dirt bag!

1187
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:41,067
(dog barking in the distance)

1188
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:44,800
(car door open)
(engine revving)

1189
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:50,233
(tires screeching)

1190
00:57:02,067 --> 00:57:05,167
Come on, come on!

1191
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,067
Come on!

1192
00:57:07,067 --> 00:57:11,067
That's it!

1193
00:57:11,067 --> 00:57:12,500
(tires screeching)

1194
00:57:12,533 --> 00:57:13,800
(honking)

1195
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,300
(tires screeching)

1196
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,800
Here we go!

1197
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,433
(tires screeching)

1198
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,900
Dammit! I'm off duty, man!

1199
00:57:38,933 --> 00:57:41,100
I don't need you guys
comin' around here!

1200
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:42,833
- Hey! What's the problem?
- Gerry: What's the problem?

1201
00:57:42,867 --> 00:57:43,700
You know what the problem is!

1202
00:57:43,733 --> 00:57:45,300
I was just
investigating an accident!

1203
00:57:45,333 --> 00:57:47,067
Well, stay off my back
or I'll give you something

1204
00:57:47,067 --> 00:57:51,967
to investigate!

1205
00:57:52,067 --> 00:57:52,800
Get outta here.

1206
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:55,400
- Okay.
- Get the hell outta here!

1207
00:57:58,533 --> 00:58:00,067
(engine revving)

1208
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,600
(tires screeching)

1209
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,100
You got nothin' on me!

1210
00:58:06,133 --> 00:58:07,667
Nothin'!

1211
00:58:29,967 --> 00:58:31,167
What do you got?

1212
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,367
You know Bobby Kellogg?

1213
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,767
Sure, I pensioned
him out of narcotics

1214
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,133
a couple of months ago. Why?

1215
00:58:35,167 --> 00:58:36,633
I'm on to something hot.

1216
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:38,567
Rumor is Gerry tried to
bribe him off a drug bust

1217
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,067
just before that.

1218
00:58:40,067 --> 00:58:41,400
Kellogg didn't go for it.

1219
00:58:41,433 --> 00:58:43,067
Jake: Rumor according
to who?

1220
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,600
A narcotics cop.

1221
00:58:44,633 --> 00:58:46,167
No way he'll come forward.

1222
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,633
I got Kellogg tracked,
he doesn't wanna come in.

1223
00:58:50,667 --> 00:58:51,900
He's up and down, Jake.

1224
00:58:51,933 --> 00:58:53,767
I don't know what kinda
witness he's gonna make.

1225
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,400
Our only witness.

1226
00:58:55,433 --> 00:58:57,900
He won't talk to
me about anything.

1227
00:58:57,933 --> 00:58:59,733
I danced around what
we wanted to know,

1228
00:58:59,767 --> 00:59:01,200
he wouldn't bite.

1229
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:03,067
Said he'd only talk to you.

1230
00:59:03,067 --> 00:59:05,200
In secret, and off the record.

1231
00:59:05,233 --> 00:59:08,333
Set it up.
Any place, anywhere.

1232
00:59:08,367 --> 00:59:10,200
You got the word,
Gerry could get the word.

1233
00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:11,467
I wanna move on this now.

1234
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,700
Move how?

1235
00:59:12,733 --> 00:59:14,567
Whatever Kellogg gives us,

1236
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,067
I'll slip into the polygraph.

1237
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:19,867
That ought to get Gerry hoppin'.

1238
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:20,933
Gerry: That wasn't
a lie detector test,

1239
00:59:20,967 --> 00:59:22,067
that was an inquisition!

1240
00:59:22,067 --> 00:59:23,300
Something's wrong here, Jake!

1241
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:24,533
What do you mean?

1242
00:59:24,567 --> 00:59:25,767
Gerry: I mean that wasn't the
regular polygraph guy.

1243
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,067
That was a fed, I could feel it,

1244
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:28,500
I could hear it the
way he was talking.

1245
00:59:28,533 --> 00:59:30,167
I mean it's probably all
taped and that's illegal.

1246
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,433
Jake: It would be.

1247
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:32,633
Gerry: Yeah. Yeah.
Well, listen,

1248
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:34,433
I don't like this whole thing.
You should be behind me,

1249
00:59:34,467 --> 00:59:35,900
instead of draggin'
me over here.

1250
00:59:35,933 --> 00:59:37,333
I am behind you,
but you gotta remember,

1251
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:40,200
Commissioner Kirkland's
behind me with a cattle prod.

1252
00:59:40,233 --> 00:59:42,133
Cops are under investigation
and he wants the truth!

1253
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:43,533
The truth?

1254
00:59:43,567 --> 00:59:45,400
The truth is that I'm
being set up with a bogus

1255
00:59:45,433 --> 00:59:46,500
lie detector test.

1256
00:59:46,533 --> 00:59:48,633
The truth is that I'm being
spied on in my own house

1257
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:49,800
at four o'clock in the morning,

1258
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:51,133
from guys from my
own department.

1259
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,700
Your department, Jake.

1260
00:59:52,733 --> 00:59:54,533
What do you mean by that?

1261
00:59:54,567 --> 00:59:57,167
(sighs) I mean, whose
side are you on, huh?

1262
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,733
I'm on your side, Gerry,

1263
00:59:58,767 --> 01:00:00,400
but I've got pressure on me.

1264
01:00:00,433 --> 01:00:02,100
Lots of it.

1265
01:00:02,133 --> 01:00:06,467
I'll bet.
Let's get outta here.

1266
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,167
(tires squealing)

1267
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,133
Bobby Kellogg,
how ya doin'?

1268
01:00:44,167 --> 01:00:45,467
Cut to the chase, Quinn,

1269
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,667
what do you want?

1270
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,300
I want you to
give me Clemente.

1271
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:50,333
Clemente's not mine to give.

1272
01:00:50,367 --> 01:00:51,567
What do I know?

1273
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,333
You know about the
Wellington Circle bust.

1274
01:00:53,367 --> 01:00:54,933
Clemente tried to
bribe you, didn't he?

1275
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:56,167
He offered you money,
you refused.

1276
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:59,067
Dealers went down.
Clemente told Scarzi--

1277
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,600
Well you know so damn much,
what do you need me for?

1278
01:01:01,633 --> 01:01:03,300
I wanna bring
him up on charges.

1279
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:05,467
I wanna take away his bars.

1280
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:07,600
And I need your
testimony to do that.

1281
01:01:07,633 --> 01:01:10,667
Without you,
I've got nothing on him.

1282
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,867
Then you got nothin'.

1283
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,567
Gerry's dirty, Bobby.

1284
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,233
He stinks to hell.

1285
01:01:17,267 --> 01:01:19,533
And that makes guys
like you and me stink too.

1286
01:01:19,567 --> 01:01:20,900
Good cops.

1287
01:01:20,933 --> 01:01:25,633
Even good cops
don't rat on cops, man.

1288
01:01:25,667 --> 01:01:27,667
He shouldn't be
on the streets.

1289
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:29,200
He shouldn't be
wearing a badge.

1290
01:01:29,233 --> 01:01:30,567
It's not right,
you know it's not right!

1291
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,600
Right?

1292
01:01:31,633 --> 01:01:32,667
What's right anymore, man?

1293
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:33,767
He's a cop!

1294
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,067
No he's not.

1295
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,200
Nothing like you were.

1296
01:01:36,233 --> 01:01:37,800
He's nothing like you ever were.

1297
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:39,633
Help me bring him down.

1298
01:01:39,667 --> 01:01:41,433
Let's bring him down together.

1299
01:01:41,467 --> 01:01:44,433
I need you!
If you don't do this--

1300
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:46,367
(squealing tires)

1301
01:01:55,267 --> 01:01:56,333
Bobby?

1302
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:05,633
Gerry: One year down,
four to go.

1303
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:07,067
You know something', Gerry?

1304
01:02:07,067 --> 01:02:10,733
Between your boat
and this cabin

1305
01:02:10,767 --> 01:02:12,067
you're leasing up here,

1306
01:02:12,067 --> 01:02:13,900
it's good to see you
cut loose a little man.

1307
01:02:13,933 --> 01:02:15,500
You got a little uptight,
you know?

1308
01:02:15,533 --> 01:02:17,100
Move your foot, pal.

1309
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:20,867
Well, if push comes
to shove there stretch,

1310
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,100
I could trace all of this legit.

1311
01:02:23,133 --> 01:02:24,733
Not like those jewels.

1312
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,533
(laughs)

1313
01:02:26,567 --> 01:02:27,733
Might as well wear
signs around your neck

1314
01:02:27,767 --> 01:02:31,133
that says "buy drugs here".

1315
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,700
What are you looking at?
Especially you.

1316
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:35,933
Do wonders for a cheap suit,
you know that?

1317
01:02:35,967 --> 01:02:38,900
(laughs) Dress
for success, Cap'n.

1318
01:02:38,933 --> 01:02:40,500
Just part of doing business!

1319
01:02:40,533 --> 01:02:42,133
Hey, you know something?

1320
01:02:42,167 --> 01:02:43,700
Jimmy's in the real estate
business right now,

1321
01:02:43,733 --> 01:02:44,900
that's right.

1322
01:02:44,933 --> 01:02:46,633
Starting next month, I'm
gonna move into a play pad

1323
01:02:46,667 --> 01:02:47,967
right next door to him.

1324
01:02:48,067 --> 01:02:49,500
You know,
we shouldn't be scrambling

1325
01:02:49,533 --> 01:02:51,433
for any kind of money.

1326
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:54,667
I can't believe that
ferret faced Benny,

1327
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:57,767
still nickel and diming
us on the fenced jewels.

1328
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,133
(snorting)

1329
01:03:04,967 --> 01:03:06,367
(heavy breathing)

1330
01:03:10,933 --> 01:03:13,267
Oh no, Jimmy. No, man!

1331
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:15,300
Come on! Not in here,
not in my house!

1332
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:17,067
Not where I live!

1333
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,767
Come on,
it's just a little hit!

1334
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,933
Let me tell you somethin',

1335
01:03:20,967 --> 01:03:23,133
smart guys don't use this crap!

1336
01:03:23,167 --> 01:03:26,267
Frankie uses,
it's not a big deal.

1337
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:30,100
Frank's your new idol now,
is he, huh?

1338
01:03:30,133 --> 01:03:32,367
It's not like that.

1339
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,967
I can handle it.

1340
01:03:34,067 --> 01:03:35,733
Come on Jimmy, man.

1341
01:03:35,767 --> 01:03:37,867
Nobody can handle it!

1342
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:41,833
You either quit, or you die.

1343
01:03:41,867 --> 01:03:43,867
Kellogg's hiding out.

1344
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,467
I can't find him
to set up another meeting.

1345
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,533
Probably couldn't
turn him if you did.

1346
01:03:49,567 --> 01:03:51,467
More time passes,
the harder it's gonna get for us

1347
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,067
to nail Gerry on anything except

1348
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:56,400
seeing his mistress on duty.

1349
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:58,300
He's probably gonna blow cover.

1350
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:02,633
It's time we made our play.

1351
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:04,367
Gerry: A hearing
of my fitness for duty?

1352
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,900
Violation of departmental
rules and reg--

1353
01:04:05,933 --> 01:04:07,100
What is this?

1354
01:04:07,133 --> 01:04:08,667
Just what it says.

1355
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:09,800
I haven't heard
anything for months

1356
01:04:09,833 --> 01:04:11,633
from the Depositor's Trust job.

1357
01:04:11,667 --> 01:04:13,067
This has nothing
to do with the bank job.

1358
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:14,767
Well, I can see that!

1359
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,900
Dereliction of duty,

1360
01:04:15,933 --> 01:04:18,700
my competence
to serve as an officer?

1361
01:04:18,733 --> 01:04:21,133
We have a unique
situation here.

1362
01:04:21,167 --> 01:04:23,167
We don't quite know
how to handle it.

1363
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,400
Full hearing
scheduled for September.

1364
01:04:24,433 --> 01:04:27,567
You seem to be handling
it pretty well.

1365
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,800
Jake: I'm sorry.

1366
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:36,067
(sigh) Sorry doesn't wash.

1367
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:41,100
Not anymore.

1368
01:04:41,133 --> 01:04:43,333
It's out in the open now.

1369
01:04:43,367 --> 01:04:44,933
What?

1370
01:04:44,967 --> 01:04:47,233
It's you against me, isn't it?

1371
01:04:47,267 --> 01:04:51,833
That's what it's been
all along.

1372
01:04:51,867 --> 01:04:53,167
(sneers)

1373
01:05:01,833 --> 01:05:03,967
(door closes)

1374
01:05:13,733 --> 01:05:16,400
Lieutenant Brill,

1375
01:05:16,433 --> 01:05:18,900
in your deposition,
you've affirmed seeing

1376
01:05:18,933 --> 01:05:20,867
Captain Clemente's
watch commander's car

1377
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:22,700
parked outside
Miss Sherwood's home

1378
01:05:22,733 --> 01:05:25,833
on several different occasions
while he was on duty.

1379
01:05:25,867 --> 01:05:28,167
During the course of one
single week in April,

1380
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:29,533
five separate times.

1381
01:05:29,567 --> 01:05:32,567
- Is that correct?
- Yes, that's correct.

1382
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,900
In response to our question

1383
01:05:33,933 --> 01:05:35,533
concerning Captain
Clemente's whereabouts during

1384
01:05:35,567 --> 01:05:39,633
Memorial Day weekend 1980
both on and off duty,

1385
01:05:39,667 --> 01:05:41,367
his response was,

1386
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,233
and I have an indication
that this was a

1387
01:05:43,267 --> 01:05:45,367
"Just between me and
you" type admission,

1388
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,167
that he spent 90% of his time

1389
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,433
meaning both on and off duty,

1390
01:05:49,467 --> 01:05:51,067
with a friend.

1391
01:05:51,067 --> 01:05:52,333
Kelly Sherwood.

1392
01:05:52,367 --> 01:05:54,067
So, Miss Sherwood,

1393
01:05:54,067 --> 01:05:55,533
you would have this
hearing believe,

1394
01:05:55,567 --> 01:05:58,500
that at no time during
your four-year acquaintance

1395
01:05:58,533 --> 01:06:00,100
with Captain Clemente,

1396
01:06:00,133 --> 01:06:01,500
did he ever visit you at home,

1397
01:06:01,533 --> 01:06:02,867
except on official business,

1398
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,700
while he was on duty?

1399
01:06:04,733 --> 01:06:06,700
That's right.

1400
01:06:06,733 --> 01:06:11,333
I mean when he was there,
it was only business.

1401
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:16,333
(low volume chatter)

1402
01:06:16,367 --> 01:06:18,800
You got nothin', Quinn.
This is a joke!

1403
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:20,500
This is a 30-day
slap on the wrist,

1404
01:06:20,533 --> 01:06:22,300
And I'm gonna
look good walkin'.

1405
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:23,633
Walkin' straight to hell.

1406
01:06:23,667 --> 01:06:25,300
Huh-uh, walking right
into your job pa--

1407
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:27,067
Hey!

1408
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:30,133
Gerry, come on, come on.

1409
01:06:33,533 --> 01:06:35,133
(cheers)
(whistles)

1410
01:06:37,567 --> 01:06:38,867
I'm sweatin' out
a hearing while everybody's

1411
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,933
getting nice, chummy.

1412
01:06:41,967 --> 01:06:44,167
So you guys playin' it
fast and loose, are ya?

1413
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,800
Out here all alone, huh?

1414
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:50,067
Spending too much money,
are ya?

1415
01:06:50,067 --> 01:06:52,267
Me and Benny we got what,

1416
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,433
25 G's a piece into this place?

1417
01:06:54,467 --> 01:06:55,767
That's chicken feed
to what's comin',

1418
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,433
when I start moving the stones.

1419
01:06:57,467 --> 01:07:00,833
I got that song and dance
comin' out of my ears, Benny.

1420
01:07:00,867 --> 01:07:03,700
Come on, I'm dishin' out!

1421
01:07:03,733 --> 01:07:05,633
Gerry: I thought it was
supposed to be $20 million

1422
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:08,333
divided by six G's comin'.

1423
01:07:08,367 --> 01:07:09,800
I sure as hell ain't
got anywhere near

1424
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:13,667
my end comin'.

1425
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:18,500
I wonder if everybody's getting
a fair shake. That's all.

1426
01:07:18,533 --> 01:07:19,400
I wonder that a lot.

1427
01:07:19,433 --> 01:07:21,867
I'm doing the best
I can, I swear it!

1428
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:23,700
If I'm lyin' I'm dyin'.

1429
01:07:23,733 --> 01:07:24,800
(laughs)

1430
01:07:28,067 --> 01:07:31,067
That's for sure,
Benny me boy.

1431
01:07:31,067 --> 01:07:32,400
That's for sure.

1432
01:07:32,433 --> 01:07:33,500
What's so funny?

1433
01:07:33,533 --> 01:07:35,200
Hey. Lighten up pal.

1434
01:07:35,233 --> 01:07:36,733
Oh, I get it.

1435
01:07:36,767 --> 01:07:40,467
Hey, to me that's not funny!

1436
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:42,200
Cops!

1437
01:07:42,233 --> 01:07:45,833
Whatever was I thinkin'
to go into business with cops!

1438
01:07:45,867 --> 01:07:47,667
Money, pal. Money.

1439
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:49,067
Hey! Hey!

1440
01:07:49,067 --> 01:07:50,833
I'm gonna tell you somethin',
you guys stink!

1441
01:07:50,867 --> 01:07:52,333
- Hey!
- Hey!

1442
01:07:52,367 --> 01:07:55,333
(crowd cheering)

1443
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:16,233
Bobby. I hope
this isn't just social.

1444
01:08:16,267 --> 01:08:18,067
I'm comin' in clean.

1445
01:08:18,067 --> 01:08:21,600
Good!

1446
01:08:21,633 --> 01:08:23,900
What changed your mind?

1447
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:27,133
I thought long and hard
about what you said.

1448
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:29,300
Clemente's not a cop, man.

1449
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:31,467
He's rotten.

1450
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,867
And if I don't turn him in,

1451
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,933
that makes everything
that I stood for as a cop,

1452
01:08:34,967 --> 01:08:38,200
everything that I went through,

1453
01:08:38,233 --> 01:08:40,867
mean nothin'!

1454
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:45,400
And I can't live with that.

1455
01:08:45,433 --> 01:08:48,567
Let's bring him down.

1456
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:52,400
Two days after the arrest
of all the men

1457
01:08:52,433 --> 01:08:55,633
who led... on possession,

1458
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:57,767
Captain Clemente
here approached me

1459
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:01,467
in the rear parking
lot of the station.

1460
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:05,067
He said that he had this
guy who wanted to know

1461
01:09:05,067 --> 01:09:08,167
about the arrest.

1462
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,967
He said that...

1463
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:11,300
Captain Clemente stated that

1464
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:13,233
there was a lot of
money to be made here.

1465
01:09:13,267 --> 01:09:14,467
A lot of money to be made?

1466
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,800
Yeah.

1467
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:17,467
Now would you please
relate the remainder

1468
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:20,433
of your conversation
with Captain Clemente?

1469
01:09:20,467 --> 01:09:22,667
Huh...

1470
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:26,367
Captain Clemente said that
all this guy wanted me to do

1471
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,100
was tell the truth
about the bust,

1472
01:09:28,133 --> 01:09:29,867
you know, that...

1473
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,533
Meaning that I
should come up with

1474
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:35,100
some kind of illegality
to get him off.

1475
01:09:35,133 --> 01:09:39,233
No further questions.

1476
01:09:39,267 --> 01:09:40,633
Mr. Kellogg, is it not true,

1477
01:09:40,667 --> 01:09:42,433
that when you were
separated from Metro Police

1478
01:09:42,467 --> 01:09:43,600
in May of this year,

1479
01:09:43,633 --> 01:09:46,133
it was for Delayed
Stress Syndrome?

1480
01:09:46,167 --> 01:09:47,267
Kellogg: Yeah. Yes.

1481
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:48,900
Gerry's Lawyer: And based on
your understanding,

1482
01:09:48,933 --> 01:09:51,300
what does Delayed
Stress Syndrome mean,

1483
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:54,067
in lay terms?

1484
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,533
It means that uh...

1485
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:59,133
It means that I've been
under stress lately.

1486
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:04,000
It means that, you know, that
I'm kinda depressed sometimes.

1487
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:07,300
Nervous and paranoid.

1488
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:10,367
As a result of my
undercover activities.

1489
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:11,833
And during this time
when you were a member

1490
01:10:11,867 --> 01:10:14,467
of the Metro Police during
your undercover activities,

1491
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:19,000
did this condition ever
affect your judgment?

1492
01:10:19,033 --> 01:10:20,400
Leave that man alone!

1493
01:10:20,433 --> 01:10:22,233
- Jake: Leave him alone!
- Superintendent! Sir!

1494
01:10:22,267 --> 01:10:23,433
Bobby Kellogg was a good cop!

1495
01:10:23,467 --> 01:10:25,500
A damn good cop!
Like most cops!

1496
01:10:25,533 --> 01:10:26,533
You are out of order!

1497
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:27,633
That piece of garbage!

1498
01:10:27,667 --> 01:10:29,033
Guard!
Take him outta here!

1499
01:10:29,067 --> 01:10:30,500
(yelling)

1500
01:10:30,533 --> 01:10:33,500
(chatter)

1501
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:49,767
You may resume your testimony.

1502
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,100
Yeah. Uh, you know,

1503
01:10:52,133 --> 01:10:54,100
I'd just like to
say somethin' here

1504
01:10:54,133 --> 01:10:57,500
that my personal
condition at that time

1505
01:10:57,533 --> 01:10:59,100
had nothin' to do
with what I remember

1506
01:10:59,133 --> 01:11:03,067
about Captain Clemente
making an approach on me.

1507
01:11:03,067 --> 01:11:09,367
I mean I remember that
day absolutely clearly.

1508
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,400
Dan: Captain Clemente,

1509
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:13,233
based on the findings
and recommendations

1510
01:11:13,267 --> 01:11:14,800
of the hearing officer,

1511
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:16,900
it has been determined

1512
01:11:16,933 --> 01:11:19,733
that you are guilty
of misconduct

1513
01:11:19,767 --> 01:11:22,633
and abuse of office,
as charged.

1514
01:11:22,667 --> 01:11:27,133
As a result, it is my
decision that you be demoted.

1515
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:29,067
Two ranks, to sergeant.

1516
01:11:29,067 --> 01:11:32,067
Two ranks?
That's extreme, sir.

1517
01:11:32,067 --> 01:11:34,267
No one's ever
been dropped two.

1518
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:35,533
I'm gonna appeal.

1519
01:11:35,567 --> 01:11:37,767
That's your right.
Dismissed, Sergeant.

1520
01:11:50,733 --> 01:11:51,767
Gerry: You've fallen, 
 Jimmy boy.

1521
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,933
Look at you, you're 
 going off the deep end!

1522
01:11:53,967 --> 01:11:54,867
Jimmy: Hey!

1523
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,667
I've been hearing things,
Jimmy boy.

1524
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,433
Using on duty?
Dealing drugs?

1525
01:11:58,467 --> 01:12:00,700
What? What?

1526
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:02,600
Gotta spend money
to make money.

1527
01:12:02,633 --> 01:12:04,367
You're gonna get hit, man.

1528
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,867
Who? Who's gonna hit me?

1529
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:12,300
Just don't give up the bank!

1530
01:12:12,333 --> 01:12:17,167
Jimmy: The bank.
The bank!

1531
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:20,567
First, I'm not gettin' near it.

1532
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:27,533
And second, I don't care
anymore about the bank!

1533
01:12:27,567 --> 01:12:30,800
I got my own bank!

1534
01:12:30,833 --> 01:12:34,133
I got a snow bank.

1535
01:12:34,167 --> 01:12:37,100
A snow bank!

1536
01:12:37,133 --> 01:12:39,533
Yeah, I like that.
That's funny, huh?

1537
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:40,600
A snow bank!

1538
01:12:40,633 --> 01:12:41,800
You can ski see up that sucker.

1539
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:43,167
You see? Woo!

1540
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,267
Ski right up that sucker!

1541
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:45,967
It's a snow bank!

1542
01:12:46,067 --> 01:12:50,233
You're fried, man.

1543
01:12:50,267 --> 01:12:52,200
God, I don't know what's worse,

1544
01:12:52,233 --> 01:13:03,067
you flashin' coin
or dealin' drugs!

1545
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,367
What do you want me to do, huh?

1546
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:08,433
What do you expect?

1547
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,300
We haven't seen a dime.

1548
01:13:10,333 --> 01:13:14,467
Not a dime
worth a penny! Nothin'!

1549
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,567
Nothin' but excuses!
That's it!

1550
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,167
(yells in frustration)

1551
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,600
Hey, hey!

1552
01:13:31,633 --> 01:13:34,800
What? Why?

1553
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:36,800
- How's business, Benny? Huh?
- Gerry!

1554
01:13:36,833 --> 01:13:37,833
- Shut up!
- (gun cock click)

1555
01:13:37,867 --> 01:13:39,300
You hear that, huh?

1556
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:41,767
I want my cut Benny,
and I want it now!

1557
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,433
- Now!
- Put the gun down, please!

1558
01:13:43,467 --> 01:13:44,433
Anything, anything you want!

1559
01:13:44,467 --> 01:13:45,633
Shut up!

1560
01:13:45,667 --> 01:13:46,867
I can't get you
your whole share,

1561
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,300
you know
I can't get that much!

1562
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:49,833
I'll take the jewels.
I'll take them.

1563
01:13:49,867 --> 01:13:51,733
I'll take the gold
straight up, uncut.

1564
01:13:51,767 --> 01:13:53,967
Benny: Looks it's still gonna
take time to get it, huh?

1565
01:13:54,067 --> 01:13:56,100
You know, I don't carry
that much with me!

1566
01:13:56,133 --> 01:13:59,167
(shouting) Come on!

1567
01:13:59,200 --> 01:14:01,133
Put the gun down.

1568
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:06,067
Put the gun down. I'll get
you whatever you want.

1569
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:07,867
(gun cock click)

1570
01:14:26,767 --> 01:14:28,467
(plastic rustling)

1571
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,300
I don't know
what you said to Benny,

1572
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:34,267
but it did the trick.

1573
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:38,533
Just a taste, pal.

1574
01:14:38,567 --> 01:14:45,400
I'm outta here.

1575
01:14:45,433 --> 01:14:47,333
- Carl: It's junk, Gerry.
- What?

1576
01:14:47,367 --> 01:14:49,400
I'm sorry to tell you,
but it's pure junk!

1577
01:14:49,433 --> 01:14:51,267
Hey! Don't give me that, Carl!

1578
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:53,433
I know that piece!

1579
01:14:53,467 --> 01:14:55,133
You may think
you recognize it.

1580
01:14:55,167 --> 01:14:57,200
That's 'cause it used to
be good at some point.

1581
01:14:57,233 --> 01:14:58,633
I can't get you a cent for this.

1582
01:14:58,667 --> 01:14:59,700
What are you--

1583
01:14:59,733 --> 01:15:03,533
I'm tellin' ya, a real expert's
picked this clean.

1584
01:15:03,567 --> 01:15:08,300
(sighs) I know
just the expert.

1585
01:15:08,333 --> 01:15:18,767
(sirens)
(crowd chatters)

1586
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,067
Commissioner Kirkland
called me, what do you got?

1587
01:15:21,067 --> 01:15:22,833
Follow up on a
missing person, sir.

1588
01:15:22,867 --> 01:15:25,167
Benny Brown.
His wife called it in.

1589
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:30,167
We found this blasting
equipment in the trunk.

1590
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:35,367
FBI's on their way and they're
gonna wanna look it over.

1591
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:38,867
This have something to do
with the Depositor's Trust?

1592
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,100
Is that case still open?

1593
01:15:40,133 --> 01:15:45,867
Damn right it's open.

1594
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:50,567
Charlie, run everything
you've got on a Benny Brown.

1595
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,900
That stuff that Benny
laid on me was garbage, okay?

1596
01:15:53,933 --> 01:15:55,900
Gerry, that's what I'm
tryin' to tell you man!

1597
01:15:55,933 --> 01:15:57,533
Benny's gone!

1598
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:59,600
- What?
- Jimmy: Disappeared!

1599
01:15:59,633 --> 01:16:02,500
He got out on bail
for this grass bust.

1600
01:16:02,533 --> 01:16:04,600
He had a court date,
but he didn't show.

1601
01:16:04,633 --> 01:16:05,867
He's vanished!

1602
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,600
He's got a lot of enemies, 
 not just us.

1603
01:16:07,633 --> 01:16:09,867
Think somebody hit him? Huh?

1604
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:12,233
Who? Frank?

1605
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:13,567
I don't know, man.

1606
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,500
But let's put it this way.

1607
01:16:15,533 --> 01:16:16,733
I think we can
forget about getting

1608
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:19,333
any more shares off
of Benny, you know?

1609
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:21,900
(slams phone)

1610
01:16:21,933 --> 01:16:24,433
Damn! Damn!

1611
01:16:29,067 --> 01:16:30,533
(office chatter)
(phone ringing)

1612
01:16:33,167 --> 01:16:34,833
(crash)
(screaming)

1613
01:16:38,433 --> 01:16:40,167
You all right, Sergeant?

1614
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:43,433
(groaning) I don't think so.

1615
01:16:43,467 --> 01:16:45,533
I think I busted a rib.

1616
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:48,400
Well, you can go to the
hospital if you want.

1617
01:16:48,433 --> 01:16:50,067
(coughs)

1618
01:16:56,167 --> 01:16:57,967
Freak accident?

1619
01:16:58,067 --> 01:17:00,300
I half figured him
pulling a number like that.

1620
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:03,267
Ten to one sick
leave and pension.

1621
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,100
At least it'll be
at a sergeant's rate.

1622
01:17:05,133 --> 01:17:06,333
You must be happy.

1623
01:17:06,367 --> 01:17:09,067
I'll only feel
really happy, Captain,

1624
01:17:09,067 --> 01:17:11,133
when I nail him on the bank job.

1625
01:17:31,933 --> 01:17:34,567
Sick leave agrees with ya.

1626
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,400
You're looking good.

1627
01:17:36,433 --> 01:17:39,067
Doogie: Hey Ger!

1628
01:17:39,067 --> 01:17:42,100
You hear my theory
on Benny Brown?

1629
01:17:42,133 --> 01:17:45,733
He's layin' out flat
on the beach in Tahiti,

1630
01:17:45,767 --> 01:17:48,700
And next year,
when the statute's up,

1631
01:17:48,733 --> 01:17:51,333
it's the resurrection
of Benny Brown.

1632
01:17:51,367 --> 01:17:58,433
(sigh) Benny better stay dead
if he knows what's good for him.

1633
01:17:58,467 --> 01:17:59,600
Doing business with the IRA,

1634
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,700
are we Jimmy, huh?

1635
01:18:01,733 --> 01:18:03,233
Just branchin' out a little.

1636
01:18:03,267 --> 01:18:04,767
Yeah.

1637
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:05,767
(gun cock click)

1638
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:11,700
I don't believe this.

1639
01:18:11,733 --> 01:18:15,067
We spent over four years
layin' low on that bank job.

1640
01:18:15,067 --> 01:18:16,833
We've got less
than 9 months to go

1641
01:18:16,867 --> 01:18:20,133
and you guys wanna deal
guns on top of drugs.

1642
01:18:20,167 --> 01:18:21,733
You wanna go and blow it all!

1643
01:18:21,767 --> 01:18:23,433
Well damn you, Jimmy Boy!

1644
01:18:23,467 --> 01:18:24,967
What are you, my mother?

1645
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:27,733
(phone rings)

1646
01:18:27,767 --> 01:18:31,267
Yeah? Lay it on me.

1647
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:35,567
What? That's the deal, man.

1648
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,267
Listen to me, that's the deal!

1649
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,800
You don't back out!

1650
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:41,300
You blow this Jimmy,
I swear to God!

1651
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:41,367
I swear to God!

1652
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,733
If I have to, I'll come down
there myself, you understand?

1653
01:18:45,767 --> 01:18:47,800
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1654
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:51,800
Yeah, I'll move south.

1655
01:18:51,833 --> 01:18:53,567
You know what's going south?

1656
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,667
Do you know what's going south?

1657
01:18:54,700 --> 01:18:55,800
I'll tell you
what's going south.

1658
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:57,300
My money is what's going south!

1659
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:58,467
You get it?

1660
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:00,300
Now you tell me!

1661
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:02,067
Jimmy: All I gotta do is 
 I gotta go down there

1662
01:19:02,067 --> 01:19:03,867
and I gotta find 
 out what's goin' on!

1663
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:05,100
Man: Yeah?

1664
01:19:05,133 --> 01:19:06,333
I'll tell you what's going on.

1665
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:07,767
They're trying to screw us!

1666
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:09,433
They found another 
 source for their drugs.

1667
01:19:09,467 --> 01:19:11,833
And you blew it Jimmy! 
 You blew it!

1668
01:19:11,867 --> 01:19:13,800
You're an idiot!

1669
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:14,867
Jake: Yeah?

1670
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:16,200
You're gonna love this!

1671
01:19:16,233 --> 01:19:17,400
Mississippi State
Police just nailed

1672
01:19:17,433 --> 01:19:19,133
Jimmy Donnelly for drugs!

1673
01:19:19,167 --> 01:19:20,467
Medford Sergeant Donnelly?

1674
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,400
- One and the same!
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

1675
01:19:22,433 --> 01:19:23,833
Just gets better!

1676
01:19:23,867 --> 01:19:25,400
Feds are onto him
for crossing state lines

1677
01:19:25,433 --> 01:19:27,233
with illegal firearms.

1678
01:19:27,267 --> 01:19:28,767
Gift from God.

1679
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,067
With the right squeeze,
he could

1680
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:31,467
cough up Gerry and the bank.

1681
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,333
Keep me on top of this.

1682
01:19:33,367 --> 01:19:35,200
And one more thing.

1683
01:19:35,233 --> 01:19:36,533
Benny Brown.

1684
01:19:36,567 --> 01:19:37,700
That alarm man
who disappeared?

1685
01:19:37,733 --> 01:19:38,867
Yeah.

1686
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,433
Turns out he was owners
in that bar of his

1687
01:19:41,467 --> 01:19:45,767
with a retired Metro
sergeant, Frank Moran.

1688
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:47,867
Hypertension discharge.

1689
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:49,533
Guy's really on the edge.

1690
01:19:49,567 --> 01:19:51,600
Check him out.

1691
01:19:51,633 --> 01:19:53,900
If we can link Frank to Gerry,

1692
01:19:53,933 --> 01:19:56,200
that could get us the bank.

1693
01:19:56,233 --> 01:19:57,367
Just a minute.

1694
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:04,000
Gerry?

1695
01:20:04,033 --> 01:20:04,067
Yeah.

1696
01:20:05,267 --> 01:20:08,300
It's Frank Morran, he's
going crazy over something.

1697
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:09,833
When's this gonna be over?

1698
01:20:09,867 --> 01:20:12,867
You said you'd quit!

1699
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:18,000
Yeah? Tell me.

1700
01:20:18,033 --> 01:20:20,367
Damn! I knew this
was gonna happen!

1701
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:21,900
Frank: I'm out Gerry! 
 See?

1702
01:20:21,933 --> 01:20:24,067
I'm outta pile.

1703
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:26,567
Jimmy nailed me 
 good on this one.

1704
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:28,933
That's my money that got burned
 on that Mississippi deal.

1705
01:20:28,967 --> 01:20:30,133
That's mine!

1706
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:32,333
And he owed me big!

1707
01:20:32,367 --> 01:20:33,567
Gerry: Well listen Frank, 
 Jimmy's out on bail.

1708
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,467
He'll be back and
we'll work it out.

1709
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,700
Oh yeah, right.

1710
01:20:36,733 --> 01:20:39,367
Sure, we're gonna
work it out, huh?

1711
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,767
He's your friend, isn't he?

1712
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:48,167
How come you're always
takin' up with him, huh?

1713
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:49,967
You know somethin'?

1714
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,100
I should never have moved
in across the street here.

1715
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:54,300
What an idiot I am!

1716
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:58,200
I'm payin' him rent,
and he owes me money!

1717
01:20:58,233 --> 01:20:59,633
Should never,

1718
01:20:59,667 --> 01:21:01,867
never have had anything
to do with that idiot!

1719
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,067
Hey!

1720
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,633
Sweetheart, I want
you to get upstairs.

1721
01:21:04,667 --> 01:21:06,500
Go. Upstairs.

1722
01:21:06,533 --> 01:21:07,733
Outta here.

1723
01:21:07,767 --> 01:21:09,067
We're talkin' business,
do you understand me?

1724
01:21:09,067 --> 01:21:10,133
Do you understand me?

1725
01:21:10,167 --> 01:21:11,333
Sherry: Yeah.

1726
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:13,767
Look Frankie, I'm tellin' you

1727
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,667
what I'm gonna tell Jimmy.

1728
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,233
Now whichever way
this case works out

1729
01:21:17,267 --> 01:21:18,300
for either one of you guys,

1730
01:21:18,333 --> 01:21:19,467
don't give up the bank.

1731
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,900
You understand what
I'm saying to you?

1732
01:21:20,933 --> 01:21:23,500
We've got less than eight
months and we're home free.

1733
01:21:23,533 --> 01:21:24,667
Oh, right, the bank.

1734
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:25,867
Let me tell you somethin'.

1735
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,533
The Feds get their
hooks into Jimmy,

1736
01:21:27,567 --> 01:21:30,567
he's gonna take us all down.

1737
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:33,833
We gotta take him out.

1738
01:21:33,867 --> 01:21:38,733
Nobody takes anybody out.

1739
01:21:38,767 --> 01:21:41,433
He deals us, he's dead.

1740
01:21:41,467 --> 01:21:45,233
We stick together
or we fall apart.

1741
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:48,500
Okay.

1742
01:21:48,533 --> 01:21:50,067
Okay.

1743
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:53,167
- (office noises)
- (chatter)

1744
01:22:08,867 --> 01:22:12,233
Well, Jimmy Donnelly's
a real hard case.

1745
01:22:12,267 --> 01:22:15,533
The good sergeant's not
talking about the bank.

1746
01:22:15,567 --> 01:22:17,300
We got a local snitch
that connects him

1747
01:22:17,333 --> 01:22:19,967
and the drugs to an
ex-cop here in town.

1748
01:22:20,067 --> 01:22:22,200
Used to be one of your men.

1749
01:22:22,233 --> 01:22:27,400
- Who?
- Frank Moran.

1750
01:22:27,433 --> 01:22:29,767
Jimmy: Said I'd get you
your money, Frank.

1751
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:38,200
Jimmy. It's already
been two months, huh?

1752
01:22:38,233 --> 01:22:40,267
Make nice, Frankie!

1753
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,567
You promised Gerry
you'd make nice!

1754
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,233
- You want me to make nice, huh?
- Yeah.

1755
01:22:44,267 --> 01:22:45,800
(slap)

1756
01:22:45,833 --> 01:22:46,900
Hey, hey!

1757
01:22:46,933 --> 01:22:49,533
Don't you talk when
I'm doin' business,

1758
01:22:49,567 --> 01:22:50,867
- you understand me?
- Jimmy: Hey!

1759
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,967
You understand me?

1760
01:22:53,067 --> 01:22:54,867
(Sherry laughs)

1761
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:57,167
Back off.

1762
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:03,400
Hey, you two wanna fight,
take it next door, huh?

1763
01:23:03,433 --> 01:23:06,600
And what's this Gerry business?

1764
01:23:06,633 --> 01:23:09,933
Gerry says you're gonna
give the Feds the bank.

1765
01:23:09,967 --> 01:23:12,433
He says you're gonna deal us.

1766
01:23:12,467 --> 01:23:14,067
Jimmy: Gerry says.

1767
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:18,300
Gerry's a loser.

1768
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:20,867
He's still got his bank pile
buried out in his backyard

1769
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:23,467
like it's gonna
grow a money tree.

1770
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:27,533
- Really?
- Yeah.

1771
01:23:27,567 --> 01:23:30,367
Well let's just
forget him, huh?

1772
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,367
Now, I want my dough.
I mean it.

1773
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,833
Do not push me.

1774
01:23:34,867 --> 01:23:36,767
You'll get your money.

1775
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,600
Sherry: You'll get it, Frankie!

1776
01:23:38,633 --> 01:23:42,433
- Okay.
- Sherry: You're so smart.

1777
01:23:42,467 --> 01:23:43,633
You wanna play games,
don't ya sweetie?

1778
01:23:43,667 --> 01:23:44,800
Yeah.

1779
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:47,867
Huh? You wanna play games?

1780
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:49,633
Okay, we're gonna
play some games.

1781
01:23:49,667 --> 01:23:50,667
(gun cock click)
(Sherry gasps)

1782
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:51,700
Frank! Back off.

1783
01:23:51,733 --> 01:23:53,567
Knock it off!

1784
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:57,667
Frank.
Hey, what's this huh?

1785
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,533
Come on.

1786
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:02,633
I said you'd get
your money, huh?

1787
01:24:02,667 --> 01:24:05,067
Just need some time.

1788
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:10,667
Just some time. Okay?

1789
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:12,433
Okay, Jimmy.

1790
01:24:12,467 --> 01:24:17,400
Come on, sweet cheeks.

1791
01:24:17,433 --> 01:24:19,233
Get outta here.

1792
01:24:19,267 --> 01:24:21,533
(- giggles)

1793
01:24:21,567 --> 01:24:23,200
You got two days, Jimmy.

1794
01:24:23,233 --> 01:24:26,067
(ticking clock)

1795
01:24:32,133 --> 01:24:34,767
Jimmy: Hey Gerry, Frank's going 
 off the deep end and fast.

1796
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,867
He's got some people 
 real mad at him, you know ?

1797
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:38,433
Drug people.

1798
01:24:38,467 --> 01:24:41,567
Word's out something's
gonna be done about it.

1799
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,067
Well people say
that all the time.

1800
01:24:43,067 --> 01:24:45,167
It don't mean anything, Jimmy.

1801
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:46,833
Yeah, well.

1802
01:24:46,867 --> 01:24:50,233
I just thought you
ought to know.

1803
01:24:50,267 --> 01:24:53,333
Fair enough,
listen I gotta go.

1804
01:24:53,367 --> 01:24:54,933
I gotta get outta here.

1805
01:24:54,967 --> 01:24:58,333
Hey, Gerry.

1806
01:24:58,367 --> 01:24:59,833
We haven't seen
each other like pals,

1807
01:24:59,867 --> 01:25:01,733
you know, in a long time.

1808
01:25:01,767 --> 01:25:03,567
What do you say you
come by tonight, huh?

1809
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,433
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

1810
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:06,800
I don't think so.

1811
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:08,967
Come on, what? Is it Mary?

1812
01:25:09,067 --> 01:25:11,833
Yeah. She's got me on
a short leash, you know.

1813
01:25:11,867 --> 01:25:13,500
Well, come by
after she's asleep.

1814
01:25:13,533 --> 01:25:15,633
Say, midnight.

1815
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:17,367
Midnight?

1816
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,333
It's a little late for a
civilian to be leavin' his wife.

1817
01:25:19,367 --> 01:25:20,533
Asleep or not.

1818
01:25:20,567 --> 01:25:22,500
Come on, we can talk.

1819
01:25:22,533 --> 01:25:23,700
We can go out and have
a couple of beers.

1820
01:25:23,733 --> 01:25:25,767
It'd be like old times, huh?

1821
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:27,567
What do you say?
Gerry, listen.

1822
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,133
Listen to me.

1823
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:31,967
Just huh... call me first.

1824
01:25:32,067 --> 01:25:35,967
Around 11:30. Okay?

1825
01:25:36,067 --> 01:25:42,267
Yeah, Jimmy.
I'll call you.

1826
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,900
I'll call you, all right?

1827
01:25:44,933 --> 01:25:46,733
Yeah.

1828
01:25:50,733 --> 01:25:52,400
Yeah, Jimmy.

1829
01:25:52,433 --> 01:25:55,467
Well, you sure as hell
better have it, pal.

1830
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,633
(snorting)

1831
01:25:56,667 --> 01:26:00,533
Right. I said I'm

1832
01:26:00,567 --> 01:26:03,200
I'll see you in a minute, pal.

1833
01:26:03,233 --> 01:26:04,933
(snorting)

1834
01:26:07,633 --> 01:26:11,200
Jimmy said he's gonna get
me all bread tonight, huh?

1835
01:26:11,233 --> 01:26:13,567
(snorting)

1836
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:17,200
He better not be lyin'.

1837
01:26:24,267 --> 01:26:25,933
Yeah.

1838
01:26:25,967 --> 01:26:27,500
(clock ticking)

1839
01:26:27,533 --> 01:26:29,400
(dog barking in the distance)

1840
01:26:43,633 --> 01:26:50,833
Hey Jimmy, I'm com in' up!
It's payout time!

1841
01:26:50,867 --> 01:26:53,467
Come on, pal (laughs).

1843
01:26:55,733 --> 01:26:57,733

1844
01:27:04,367 --> 01:27:06,267
(gun cock click)
(gunshot)

1845
01:27:07,533 --> 01:27:09,700
(gun cock click)
(gunshot)

1846
01:27:09,733 --> 01:27:12,300
(groans)

1847
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:16,067
(dog barks in the distance)
(Frank groans)

1848
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,867
(sparks)
(drilling)

1849
01:27:30,067 --> 01:27:31,767
(explosion)

1850
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,767
- (sparks)

1851
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:47,067
- (crashing)
- (groaning)

1852
01:27:57,067 --> 01:27:59,233
Frank?

1853
01:27:59,267 --> 01:28:02,833
(Frank groans)

1854
01:28:02,867 --> 01:28:06,800
Oh, my God! Frank!

1855
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:08,367
Gimme my gun!

1856
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,133
Gimme my gun!

1857
01:28:16,067 --> 01:28:18,067
Sherry: Please!
Someone's been shot!

1858
01:28:18,067 --> 01:28:19,300
- Operator: How bad? 
- He's dying!

1859
01:28:19,333 --> 01:28:20,433
Operator: Address?

1860
01:28:20,467 --> 01:28:25,933
17 Pleasant Street.
Hurry please!

1861
01:28:25,967 --> 01:28:27,200
- Frank!
- Frank: Huh?

1862
01:28:27,233 --> 01:28:29,500
Frank, it's all right!
It's gonna be all right,

1863
01:28:29,533 --> 01:28:31,167
I called the police.

1864
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:32,133
Huh?

1865
01:28:32,167 --> 01:28:33,867
- Yeah, I called the police!
- Frank: What?

1866
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:35,867
- It's gonna be all right!
- Frank: You called the cops?

1867
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:37,067
Yeah.

1868
01:28:37,100 --> 01:28:39,233
What are you,
are you outta your mind?

1869
01:28:39,267 --> 01:28:42,467
Called the cops.

1870
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,167
Eight more months.

1871
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:45,867
Eight more

1872
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:47,233
months.

1873
01:28:47,267 --> 01:28:48,167
Cop: Police!

1874
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:51,467
Come on! Don't get crazy!

1875
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:53,267
Cop: Comin' up!

1876
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,333
Go, go, go!

1877
01:28:54,367 --> 01:28:56,933
Let's go, let's go.

1878
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:01,967
(police radio chatter)

1879
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:13,300
(phone keyboard tapping)

1880
01:29:13,333 --> 01:29:14,933
(phone rings)

1881
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:18,933
Quiet!

1882
01:29:18,967 --> 01:29:22,533
Jimmy!
Jimmy, is that you?

1883
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,067
(dial tone)

1884
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,867
(ticking)

1885
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,067
(phone rings)

1886
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:36,200
Hello? Hello?

1887
01:29:36,233 --> 01:29:38,300
Mr. Clemente? 
 This is Nurse Hankins

1888
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:40,067
at Surgeon's Hospital.

1889
01:29:40,067 --> 01:29:41,533
We have a patient 
 here who's made

1890
01:29:41,567 --> 01:29:44,633
an urgent request to see you.

1891
01:29:44,667 --> 01:29:46,633
I'm here to see a patient,
Frank Moran.

1892
01:29:46,667 --> 01:29:47,833
Mr. Clemente?

1893
01:29:47,867 --> 01:29:48,567
Mm-hmm.

1894
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:49,700
I spoke with you.

1895
01:29:49,733 --> 01:29:52,100
I'm sorry, but you can only
see him for 10 minutes.

1896
01:29:52,133 --> 01:29:54,233
Room 142.

1897
01:29:54,267 --> 01:29:55,367
(groaning)

1898
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:56,900
Frank, Frank!

1899
01:29:56,933 --> 01:29:58,467
What happened here?

1900
01:29:58,500 --> 01:29:59,833
Gerry, you scared
the hell outta me.

1901
01:29:59,867 --> 01:30:01,133
What the hell happened to--

1902
01:30:01,167 --> 01:30:03,533
Oh, man, they told me
it was gunshot wounds.

1903
01:30:03,567 --> 01:30:05,667
Gunshot wounds nothin'.

1904
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:06,767
Come on, sit, come on.

1905
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,933
I got shot through
in two loads.

1906
01:30:08,967 --> 01:30:10,267
- What?
- Frank: Yeah.

1907
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,533
Easy, easy, there you go.

1908
01:30:11,567 --> 01:30:12,700
If I wouldn't have
been so loaded myself,

1909
01:30:12,733 --> 01:30:13,867
I'd be dead right now.

1910
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:15,967
They had to pinch
an artery right here.

1911
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,367
Oh, man.

1912
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,533
Damn Jimmy.

1913
01:30:19,567 --> 01:30:23,033
- Jimmy did this?
- Frank: Yeah!

1914
01:30:23,067 --> 01:30:25,133
Yeah. Jimmy tried to stroke me!

1915
01:30:25,167 --> 01:30:27,333
He tried to
take me out last night!

1916
01:30:27,367 --> 01:30:28,333
Why?

1917
01:30:28,367 --> 01:30:29,633
Frank: Drugs. Money.

1918
01:30:29,667 --> 01:30:31,533
Million reasons in that
fried out brain of his,

1919
01:30:31,567 --> 01:30:33,167
none of which makes any sense!

1920
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:36,200
(coughs) Sherry...

1921
01:30:36,233 --> 01:30:39,633
Sherry called the cops, Gerry.

1922
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:41,567
Oh, this is bad, man.

1923
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:44,567
- This is bad.
- Frank: You're telling me?

1924
01:30:44,600 --> 01:30:47,400
You know, they got Jimmy
on that Mississippi deal.

1925
01:30:47,433 --> 01:30:49,267
And Quinn's got him
for attempted murder,

1926
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:50,500
dead their rights.

1927
01:30:50,533 --> 01:30:52,767
Quinn, Quinn, Quinn.

1928
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,233
Yeah, Quinn.

1929
01:30:54,267 --> 01:30:55,400
Quinn was right on it,

1930
01:30:55,433 --> 01:30:57,433
like he knew somethin'
was gonna pop.

1931
01:30:57,467 --> 01:30:59,500
Jimmy's gonna give up
the Depositor's Trust.

1932
01:30:59,533 --> 01:31:02,333
He's gonna bargain
the shooting and the drug bust

1933
01:31:02,367 --> 01:31:04,600
and we're both
gonna go down, man!

1934
01:31:04,633 --> 01:31:05,933
You're damn right.

1935
01:31:05,967 --> 01:31:07,500
Soon as I can get up
I'm outta here like,

1936
01:31:07,533 --> 01:31:10,500
(coughs) like a shot!

1937
01:31:10,533 --> 01:31:12,400
Jimmy's gonna sell
us down the tubes!

1938
01:31:12,433 --> 01:31:13,800
- Hey, easy!
- (Frank coughs violently)

1939
01:31:13,833 --> 01:31:15,833
Take it easy,
it'll be all right.

1940
01:31:15,867 --> 01:31:18,067
No, no it's okay!

1941
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,467
There, there.

1942
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:25,067
Hey man, what's this?

1943
01:31:25,067 --> 01:31:27,067
A wire?

1944
01:31:27,067 --> 01:31:30,767
You're wearing a wire?

1945
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,400
(groans)

1946
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:40,633
You gave the bank to Quinn.

1947
01:31:40,667 --> 01:31:43,100
Jimmy tried to kill me, man.

1948
01:31:43,133 --> 01:31:46,100
He's your pal.
He was your pal!

1949
01:31:46,133 --> 01:31:47,800
You set me up, man!

1950
01:31:47,833 --> 01:31:49,833
I'm not gonna let
you guys sandbag me.

1951
01:31:49,867 --> 01:31:53,067
No way!

1952
01:31:53,067 --> 01:31:55,767
I'm not goin' down!

1953
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,633
I'm not goin' down for you!

1954
01:31:57,667 --> 01:32:01,200
I'm not goin' down for nobody!

1955
01:32:01,233 --> 01:32:03,867
I'm gettin' off for everything.

1956
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:04,767
(gun cock click)

1957
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,933
Go ahead.

1958
01:32:07,967 --> 01:32:10,067
Let the cards fall
where they may.

1959
01:32:10,067 --> 01:32:11,767
(gun cock click)

1960
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,067
(Frank coughs)

1961
01:32:20,133 --> 01:32:22,233
(spits) You go to hell!

1962
01:32:22,267 --> 01:32:24,367
Yeah? See you there!

1963
01:32:31,567 --> 01:32:32,700
Freeze!

1964
01:32:32,733 --> 01:32:33,900
Okay, all right.

1965
01:32:33,933 --> 01:32:38,167
Easy, easy. Easy!

1966
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,833
You're under arrest, Gerry,

1967
01:32:39,867 --> 01:32:42,100
For the burglary of the
Depositor's Trust Bank.

1968
01:32:42,133 --> 01:32:43,900
What are you kiddin' me?
You got no proof.

1969
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:45,667
Frank's a co-conspirator!

1970
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:47,967
It ain't gonna stick, Jake.

1971
01:32:48,067 --> 01:32:49,533
You have the right
to remain silent,

1972
01:32:49,567 --> 01:32:51,067
you have the right
to an attorney--

1973
01:32:51,100 --> 01:32:52,300
Let it rest, will ya?

1974
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:54,200
I know it by heart.
I'm a cop remember?

1975
01:32:54,233 --> 01:32:56,067
You wore a badge, Gerry.

1976
01:32:56,067 --> 01:32:57,700
You were never a cop.

1977
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,067
(jail doors clanging shut)

1978
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,333
Jake: His fate 
 remains unknown.
