one little piece.

to let it all come off naturally.

looks so young and fragile.

just one little piece.

the white tiger?

I was planning on it,
and just as I was about to,

189
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:48,210
I thought to myself,
does a white tiger really want

190
00:10:48,212 --> 00:10:49,879
- to attend a sweet 16?
- Yes.

191
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:52,882
Because Kayla Drew had one at her
party, and it was, like, amazing.

probably illegally

to parties...

00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:02,157

enough energy to draw me.

345
00:18:54,898 --> 00:18:56,767
Oh, fuck!

346
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,605
Oh...

347
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:04,140
They haven't taken him yet,
have they?

348
00:19:04,142 --> 00:19:05,241
Taken who?

349
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:06,542
Jack Jaconi, my father.

350
00:19:06,544 --> 00:19:07,977
Oh, he should be out
any minute.

351
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:09,911
He said that you
were coming for him.

352
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:11,247
He said I was coming?

353
00:19:11,249 --> 00:19:14,819
Yeah, he said you'd be here
at 10:00 on the dot.

354
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,922
Of course, he did.

355
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:19,989
You got played.

356
00:19:19,991 --> 00:19:22,260
(LAUGHS)
What's the scowl for?

357
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:25,061
You knew I was coming?

358
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,430
I had a feeling. (LAUGHS)

359
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,333
Uh, she's very moody, my daughter.
Always has been.

360
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,667
Hey, Hoight.

361
00:19:31,669 --> 00:19:33,969
Come with me. I want to
say goodbye to my garden.

362
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:36,205
I probably shouldn't leave
my mom.

363
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:38,107
- Of course, you should.
- LAURA: No. Excuse me.

364
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:39,642
Please don't write that.
Please don't...

365
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:41,978
Give her a chance to stop that
cop from writing her a ticket.

366
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,213
LAURA: Ten bucks. Ten bucks.

367
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:47,717
(LAUGHS)
I bet you can hardly believe,

368
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,286
considering your mother can barely
keep a piece of hair alive,

369
00:19:51,288 --> 00:19:54,692
that your grandfather's
got a green thumb.

370
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:57,692
I'm not really into gardening.

371
00:19:57,694 --> 00:20:00,464
Well, maybe what's in the shed
will change your mind.

372
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,402
I'm too old to molest,
you know.

373
00:20:04,301 --> 00:20:06,302
Oh, Jesus Christ.

374
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:09,972
You couldn't get molested
with a bow in your hair.

375
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:13,477

clear of your bad vibes.

376

No, sir.

380
00:20:29,493 --> 00:20:34,063
Uh, a French whore I once
admired fed a bud to my cat,

381
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:37,533
and she shit out
one of the seeds.

382
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:40,272

this is the good stuff.

384
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,341

385
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:46,709
Well, yeah, had to.

386
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:48,844
How else was I going to
get it in the country?

387
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:50,613
I don't know.

388
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:56,753
Now, I need you
to put this down your pants.

389
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,491
Yeah? Can you do that for me?

390
00:21:00,858 --> 00:21:03,424
Why don't you put it
down your pants?

391
00:21:03,426 --> 00:21:07,330
Because I am wearing
adult diapers.

392
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:11,065
Just stuff it in,
you little chickenshit.

393
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:15,203
Your mother's about to give me a real
hard time for taking the Rolls-Royce,

394
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:20,111
so I need something to get
her voice out of my head.

395
00:21:21,712 --> 00:21:23,411
Absolutely not.

396
00:21:23,413 --> 00:21:25,014
It's all I got.

397
00:21:25,016 --> 00:21:26,218
Then you drive it.

398
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:31,554
We had a deal. I get you to
L.A., you get me the money.

399
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,722
If you want to keep the car
so bad, then you drive it.

400
00:21:33,724 --> 00:21:37,427
Yeah, those assholes over at
DMV took my license away.

401
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:39,161
I couldn't pass the eye exam.

402
00:21:39,163 --> 00:21:43,967
And I was hoping we could
use some time together.

403
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,235
Yes, we could.
Twenty years ago.

404
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:47,670
It's not happening, Dad.

405
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:49,605
I got you
the plane ticket already,

406
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:51,740
so send the money
when you land.

407
00:21:51,742 --> 00:21:53,010
Come on, Henry.

408
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:57,479

I have set a boundary.

I'm not driving
that heap cross-country.

411
00:22:06,656 --> 00:22:08,824
You are not commandeering
this trip already.

412
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:10,759
You have done nothing
to earn this.

413
00:22:10,761 --> 00:22:12,929
- And we're doing you a favor.
- Well, I appreciate that,

414
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,663
but I'd like to spend
some time with you two.

415
00:22:15,665 --> 00:22:17,834
I hardly know Hoight.

416
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,936
And I'd like to discover
more things I like about you.

417
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:22,304

418
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:24,875
Hey, look. Laura.

419
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,477
I...

420
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,548
I didn't want to tell you
this, actually, but...

421
00:22:32,083 --> 00:22:34,152
Uh, the truth is...

422
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,921
I haven't much time left.

423
00:22:44,295 --> 00:22:46,062
I'm... I'm dying, Laura.

424
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:48,998

a few days ago.

427

in my leg,

428
00:22:56,673 --> 00:22:58,340
and when we get
to high elevation,

429
00:22:58,342 --> 00:23:01,911

another one of your schemes.

I wish it was.

433
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,721
So, why didn't you tell me?

434
00:23:12,723 --> 00:23:15,123
I didn't want to...
Didn't want to worry you.

435
00:23:15,125 --> 00:23:16,392
I knew how busy you are.

436
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,693
It doesn't matter.
You should have told me.

437
00:23:18,695 --> 00:23:20,598

the whole time.

446
00:23:54,097 --> 00:23:55,396
And how many days?

447
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:56,766
Like, two at the most.

448
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,967

450
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:01,738
I'll be back
to help with the deliveries.

451
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,974
Just give me something good,
like boils or meningitis.

452

- Can that go away in two days?
- Oh...

- How often do I feed this one?
- Every four hours.

I want a date with you.

I can't date people I like.

Well, I won't do it.

00:24:32,303 --> 00:24:33,738
You want a date?

- Yes.

00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:20,737
Oh, God, no, no, no, no, no!

517
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,771
Stay.

518
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:24,440
HENRY: Mom,
we have too many dogs.

519
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:27,075
I know, Henry. Jesus.
I live in our house.

520
00:27:27,077 --> 00:27:29,146
Relax. I'm just saying.

521
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,546
Okay. All right.

522
00:27:31,548 --> 00:27:33,716
If I...
If I call it over and it runs,

523
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:36,117
then... Then we just
let it run, right?

524
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:38,220
It does look like a runner.
It's definitely a runner.

525
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:40,055
And I don't have my good shoes
or my kit,

526
00:27:40,057 --> 00:27:42,257
so I'm not going to go chase
after it, right?

527
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:44,459
That's a runner
if I ever saw one.

528
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:45,697
Yeah, it's gonna run.

529
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:49,834
Come here, puppy.

530
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,369
Come here.

531
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,303
Fuck.

532
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:57,174
(SIGHS) No tag, no collar.

533
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,843
She's been on the streets
for a while.

534
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:04,680
Oh, God, she's cute.
Don't look at her.

535
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:07,150
- Who the hell's that?
- LAURA: Nobody.

536
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:10,052
Nobody. She probably belongs to
the owner across the street.

537
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:12,157
Well, maybe she belongs
to the gas station.

538
00:28:14,991 --> 00:28:16,326
She belongs to me.

539
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,229
They all do.

540
00:28:19,963 --> 00:28:22,797
Can't you tell?
She knew I would be here.

541
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,467
She knew. She knew.
They all know.

542
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:27,505
All of them. They all know.

543
00:28:29,807 --> 00:28:31,641
Jesus.

544
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:34,276
You're like the Pied Piper
of mange.

JACK: Well, that took
barely a minute,

550
00:28:54,597 --> 00:28:56,701
and we picked up a dog
along the way.

551
00:28:58,999 --> 00:28:59,602
I'd call it a success.

552
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:03,037
Yeah, that's exactly how I envisioned
the first hour of this trip.

553
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,542
One more thing to hide
from my therapist.

554
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,577
(CHUCKLES) Where did you
get this negativity?

555
00:29:09,579 --> 00:29:11,380
You used to laugh more.

556
00:29:11,382 --> 00:29:14,516
- I used to be able to make you laugh.
- You never made me laugh.

557
00:29:14,518 --> 00:29:16,051
I was always laughing.

558
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:17,753
Yeah, at me.

559
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:20,892
Well, I had to.
It was either that or cry.

560
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:24,692
You better let go
of some of that anger,

561
00:29:24,694 --> 00:29:28,063
or you'll end up
a pissed-off old spinster.

562
00:29:28,065 --> 00:29:30,999
You're about one
four-legged creature away.

563
00:29:31,001 --> 00:29:32,767

564
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:34,471

Oh, that's so funny!

Oh, thank you, Father.
Thank you so much.

567
00:29:42,046 --> 00:29:45,447
Like... Like I need to worry
about being a spinster,

568
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:48,217
on top of all the other things that
I'm constantly worrying about.

569
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:49,852
That's... That's...

570
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,487
I mean, as if there isn't
enough social media

571
00:29:52,489 --> 00:29:55,324
telling me that I need
to find a man. Yeah.

572
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:57,625
What? What?
I'm not getting the signals!

573
00:29:57,627 --> 00:30:00,228
What? What? I need a man?

574
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,866
How bad is it to be alone?
I can't hear. What?

575
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:06,671
Oh... See? I still laugh.

581
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:24,286
Is there really
a CPK around here?

582
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:27,157
What is going on?
Did you change my navigation?

583
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:29,257
Huh?

584
00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:31,095
Did you change this?

585
00:30:31,628 --> 00:30:33,328
Yeah.

586
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,396
This is the wrong route.

587
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:36,466
What... Did you do this?

588
00:30:40,237 --> 00:30:42,238
You changed it? Henry!

589
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,773
He gave me $20 when you
were in the gas station.

590
00:30:44,775 --> 00:30:46,508
Okay, no.

591
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,478
No, there's not gonna be any weird
little pit stops along the way.

592
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,613
No, we have to make it
to California by Friday.

593
00:30:51,615 --> 00:30:52,849
- Well...
- No.

594
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,382
Stanley is already
expecting us.

595
00:30:54,384 --> 00:30:56,183
He may even have dinner ready.

596
00:30:56,185 --> 00:31:00,388
Stanley, art forger Stanley? No,
he's involved in illegal activity.

597
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,624
I don't want Henry anywhere near him.
Absolutely not.

598
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:04,459
We have to be in California
by Friday.

599
00:31:04,461 --> 00:31:06,396
What kind of illegal activity?

600
00:31:07,898 --> 00:31:09,297
Well, the good kind,
of course.

601
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:13,501
Absolutely not. No.
We are staying at a Red Roof.

602
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:16,505
The only known criminal we're
spending time with is you.

603
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:17,942
(JACK LAUGHS)

604
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:25,980
Well, we're here.

605
00:31:25,982 --> 00:31:29,019
I hope that line of yours
is powder.

606
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:33,988
- Hey! Shit.
- (LAUGHS)

607
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,360
Here's the son of a bitch.

608
00:31:38,695 --> 00:31:40,696
Oh, man.

609
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:43,164
- Who are these people?
- Old friends of your grandfather's.

610
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:44,568
Don't inhale anything.

611
00:31:46,135 --> 00:31:48,469
Well, hello.

612
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:50,575
- Hi, Stan.
- Don't you look beautiful.

613
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,547
Oh. You look
just like your mother.

614
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,048
God rest her soul.

615
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:03,754
Where is your precious
little baby?

616
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:05,622
Hi.

617
00:32:06,088 --> 00:32:07,325
Oh, my God.

618
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,795
Isn't he gorgeous?

619
00:32:11,528 --> 00:32:14,563
Hey. Come on in.

620
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,097
You remember Jed?

621
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:18,299
- LAURA: Hi, Jed.
- JACK: Hey! Hey!

622
00:32:18,301 --> 00:32:21,370
Hey, give me a hug,
you old cripple.

623
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,872
- I like you, Jack.
- I know you do.

624
00:32:23,874 --> 00:32:26,609
He's been talking about you
for two days straight.

625
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,914
They Skype each other
every Saturday night.

626
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,748
Jack, will you Skype with me?

627
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,949
Well, no,
now I'm here in person.

628
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:39,453
You can see how handsome I am,
you know, so close up.

629
00:32:39,455 --> 00:32:42,892
Uh, tell Jed, uh, to show you
his room, Laura.

630
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:45,626
Okay. All right.
But only just for a minute,

631
00:32:45,628 --> 00:32:47,763
because this was supposed
to be a very quick trip.

632
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:51,033
Oh, nonsense.
I've got dinner on the stove,

633
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,936
and the guest room sheets
have barely been slept in.

634
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:57,972
- Oh, wonderful.
- JACK: Yeah, be there in a minute, Stan.

635
00:32:57,974 --> 00:33:01,311
Yeah, I'm on it, Sofia. Prada
wallets for the gift bags. Done.

636
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,280
Um, no, yes,
boils are very contagious,

637
00:33:06,282 --> 00:33:08,784
but I think it's best that I
work from home for a few days.

638
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,451
No, don't be concerned
about yourself.

639
00:33:10,453 --> 00:33:12,019
I'm sure it's just
an ingrown hair.

640
00:33:12,021 --> 00:33:14,155
Okay, thanks. Bye.

641
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:15,623
- Sorry.
- A little more. A little more.

642
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:16,994
Sorry, it's just my boss.

643
00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:23,164
STAN:
Making the deals and mergers.

644
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:27,268
I always knew you'd be
a successful businesswoman.

645
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,671
- I'm not a businesswoman.
- JACK: No, she's an executive.

646
00:33:29,673 --> 00:33:32,274
Assistant.
I'm an executive assistant.

647
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:35,513
Yeah, well,
"executive" is in it, yeah?

648
00:33:42,118 --> 00:33:43,986
This tastes like candy corn.

649
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:47,959
Well, it should, because
it's a candy corn casserole.

650
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:51,159
- Really?
- Hmm.

651
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:54,028
Jed loves candy corn.

652
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,034
Every bite
has something sweet.

653
00:33:59,303 --> 00:34:01,036
JED: I like candy corn, Jack.

654
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:04,907
So do I, Jed.
Not only on Halloween.

655
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,409
STAN: It's been too long.

656
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:11,179
What happened to that
wonderful husband of yours?

657
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:12,581
He left us.

658
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:14,249
No.

659
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:16,751
Well, he left me,
actually, not Henry.

660
00:34:16,753 --> 00:34:18,854
- He left me, too.
- STAN: Oh...

661
00:34:18,856 --> 00:34:25,026
Well, he has chronic fatigue, so basically
he was too tired to love us properly.

662
00:34:25,028 --> 00:34:27,465
Well, I'd still like to
string him up by his feet.

663
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:31,700
We're all each other has got.

664
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,568
And it just tickles me
to death

665
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:37,007
to see you and your father
spending time together.

666
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,508
He talks about you
all the time.

667
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,012
JACK: Yeah, mostly complaints.

668
00:34:43,213 --> 00:34:44,514
STAN: Family.

669
00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:47,784
That's all there is.

670
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,552
Isn't that right, Jed?

671
00:34:50,554 --> 00:34:53,624
- Do you like me, Jack?
- Sure do.

672
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:59,260
- Are you my friend, Jack?
- Sure am.

673
00:34:59,262 --> 00:35:01,262
Fuck yeah.

674
00:35:01,264 --> 00:35:04,134
I feel the same way.
"Fuck yeah."

675
00:35:07,304 --> 00:35:08,506
(LAUGHS)

676
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,583
(CLEARS THROAT) Uh, thank you, Hoight.
You're a man of your word.

677
00:35:21,585 --> 00:35:23,153
Now, where did you
put the plant?

678
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:28,389
What do you mean?
I still have it down my pants.

679
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:29,860
Oh, geez.

680
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:35,130
I think it gave me a rash.

681
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:37,465
I don't want to hear
about your rash.

682
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:40,971
Now, the point is,
I can trust you, huh?

683
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,008
Do you know why we're here?

684
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,742
To visit Stanley and his son?

685
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:47,812
That, and?

686
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,515

too attached, sweetheart.

859
00:46:22,411 --> 00:46:24,747
You know, he's just
a temporary situation.

860
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:29,650
You don't know that.

861
00:46:29,652 --> 00:46:31,887
Maybe I'll want to spend
more time with him after this.

862
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:34,956
No, I mean we're a temporary
situation for him.

863
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:38,226
There's a reason
he doesn't know your name.

864
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:41,929
Maybe he just had to be
reminded of how cool we were,

865
00:46:41,931 --> 00:46:43,634
and he'll want to hang out
with us from now on.

866
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:49,873

870
00:47:26,509 --> 00:47:29,909
I'm fine, I got through it,
but he's different.

871
00:47:29,911 --> 00:47:32,179
Jesus, I'm not gonna hurt
the little shit.

872
00:47:32,181 --> 00:47:33,882
Okay, because he's sensitive.

873
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:36,887
He... He can't handle the
disappointment, okay? And...

874
00:47:38,554 --> 00:47:40,655
And you have more power
than you know.

875

You... You make people fall in
love with you, and then you leave.

876
00:47:43,492 --> 00:47:44,992
And he's not like me.

877
00:47:44,994 --> 00:47:47,329
Okay, I know the drill. I've
been through it my whole life.

878
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:48,896
But he's already gotten it
from his dad,

879
00:47:48,898 --> 00:47:50,731
and he doesn't need it
from you, too.

880
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:52,700
His chronic-fatigue dad?

881
00:47:52,702 --> 00:47:56,038
Well, I never said he was professionally
diagnosed, but, yeah, it could be true.

882
00:47:58,373 --> 00:48:01,811
I'd hate to hear what you told,
uh, the little shit about me.

883
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,481
What did you tell him
about me?

884
00:48:07,483 --> 00:48:11,318
- I said that you were temporary.
- Oh... Oh...

885
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,990
That you are
a temporary situation.

886
00:48:15,826 --> 00:48:18,362
Well, good.
That's about right.

887
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:20,961
Okay. Well, it's better

888
00:48:20,963 --> 00:48:22,030
- that he knows now.
- Sure.

889
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,463
So this way he will
not be disappointed.

890
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:24,433

missing for a long time,

or not, but I have questions.

wasn't a safe space for me, and,

1192
01:06:03,425 --> 01:06:05,458
I do, and I don't think
you would do that.

1193
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:09,896
I am a mother. I could be arrested.
Uh, Henry could be arrested.

1194
01:06:09,898 --> 01:06:11,363
No one
is going to be arrested.

1195
01:06:11,365 --> 01:06:13,298
You... You don't know that.
We don't all have your luck.

1196
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:17,003
I was trying to help the kid.
You told me you needed help.

1197
01:06:17,005 --> 01:06:20,740
And this was your solution?
Trafficking drugs across the country?

1198
01:06:20,742 --> 01:06:23,142
You know what?
I don't know why I bother.

1199
01:06:23,144 --> 01:06:26,412
I mean, you just...
You just can't...

1200
01:06:26,414 --> 01:06:29,782
You can't live without being
a victim, can you? Huh?

1201
01:06:29,784 --> 01:06:33,086
(STAMMERING) You'd rather suffer
than see the good in a situation.

1202
01:06:33,088 --> 01:06:35,421
Well, I nearly got enough
for Henry's education.

1203
01:06:35,423 --> 01:06:38,590
I'm not paying for Henry's
school with drug money!

1204
01:06:38,592 --> 01:06:40,661
JACK: Oh, yeah, punish the kid.
That's smart.

1205
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:43,463
Oh, don't you dare turn
this around on me. I am mad!

1206
01:06:43,465 --> 01:06:46,800
I'm the one that's mad.
You disappointed me. Again!

1207
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:50,003
Again? I didn't know you were counting.
How many times is it?

1208
01:06:50,005 --> 01:06:53,505
My entire childhood. One
disappointment after the next.

1209
01:06:53,507 --> 01:06:56,342
You never came through. Dad, you
never came through. Not once.

1210
01:06:56,344 --> 01:06:57,811
Well, you're living,
you're breathing.

1211
01:06:57,813 --> 01:06:59,479
I sure as hell
didn't kill you.

1212
01:06:59,481 --> 01:07:02,449
Oh, thank you so much for supplying
the basics, Dad. Thank you.

1213
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:04,851
The food and the water
were brilliant.

1214
01:07:04,853 --> 01:07:08,588
- Thank you!
- Now you're being dramatic.

1215
01:07:08,590 --> 01:07:11,394
You... You don't have a clue,
do you?

1216
01:07:16,831 --> 01:07:21,069
How much time I spent
waiting for you to show up.

1217
01:07:22,737 --> 01:07:24,704
Disappearing for weeks on end,

1218
01:07:24,706 --> 01:07:28,041
never being reachable when I
was getting my heart broken.

1219
01:07:28,043 --> 01:07:31,979
Leaving me alone to take care of
Jojo in that shitty apartment.

1220
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:35,048
I spent
my entire childhood scared.

1221
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:37,585
Why weren't you there?
I needed you, Dad.

1222
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:47,026
Did you hear what I said?
I said I needed you.

I'm sorry you were scared.

1225

Please tell me
that you are dying.

1226
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:13,420
You didn't lie about that,
did you?

1227
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:16,225
At least, please, please,
tell me that that's true.

- You know what?

1234
01:08:34,143 --> 01:08:36,910
And find your own ride to L.A.
because we are done.

You're really acting crazy.

1236

get us arrested.

LAURA: You know,
and you are selfish.

1238
01:08:41,315 --> 01:08:44,550
You are absolutely incapable of
putting anyone else before yourself.

1239
01:08:44,552 --> 01:08:46,620
Maybe you could be happier
if you did the same.

1240
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,921
I mean, you wouldn't be so
goddamn miserable all the time.

- No.

Your mother has lost
all rational thought.

Don't tell me how to feel.

1245
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:56,729
You don't get to tell me
anything anymore.

any more shit for your sake.

Oh, right, the diapers.

1273
01:09:56,524 --> 01:09:58,357

flew out the window,

You can explain
her unpaid parking tickets?

Parking tickets?

1301
01:11:14,769 --> 01:11:16,538
Over $3,000 worth.
