1
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:10,049
Although? You can not go!

2
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,343
I still have a lot of things to do...

3
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,056
... But Peter can not thank you
enough to end this strike.

4
00:02:16,264 --> 00:02:18,266
These unionists me crazy.

5
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:21,395
I really admire that has
working late to put an end.

6
00:02:22,312 --> 00:02:25,441
The Tribune would have sunk without their lawyers.

7
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:27,067
It was a pleasure, Hall.

8
00:02:27,526 --> 00:02:30,655
Well, if there is anything we can
do for you please let me know.

9
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:32,824
You bet. Pleasure to review it.

10
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:37,704
Peter! Finally meet you.

11
00:02:37,871 --> 00:02:40,457
Congratulations on your party.

12
00:02:41,207 --> 00:02:44,002
I want to introduce you to someone.

13
00:02:45,307 --> 00:02:46,638
- Hello!
- Hello!

14
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:49,712
- Enjoying the party?
- Yes, thank you for the invitation.

15
00:02:50,384 --> 00:02:52,928
This is Larry Jenkins,
a longtime friend.

16
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:55,514
We studied together in Boston. He is editor.

17
00:02:56,223 --> 00:02:59,310
Alan's father was a sailor with Hall.

18
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:02,230
Now Alan works with
Hall at The Tribune.

19
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:03,940
I am an intern.

20
00:03:04,107 --> 00:03:07,319
He eventually graduated from UCLA
and is writing her first book.

21
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:09,863
And Hall said that Ime is
a very talented writer.

22
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,532
Well .. Send me when you're done.

23
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:14,785
I will gladly read it.

24
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,211
Thank you.

25
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:19,874
Listen. Gotta go. Have a nice day.

26
00:03:23,694 --> 00:03:27,423
Why not stay here until
everyone has gone.

27
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,300
We can discuss your future.

28
00:03:29,634 --> 00:03:33,138
I have to bring home Hall
and I still have things to do.

29
00:03:33,305 --> 00:03:34,598
It's simple...

30
00:03:34,806 --> 00:03:37,059
back when you're finished.

31
00:03:37,225 --> 00:03:39,311
In any case the party will
even get it later.

32
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,563
I do not think I can.

33
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,107
No, I insist.

34
00:03:45,264 --> 00:03:47,736
Ok, thanks

35
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,997
When the cat is not
mice make the party!

36
00:05:55,748 --> 00:05:58,584
Look... "Greg Brady"
the next time someone wants to take...

37
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,130
Go home and put some decent clothes, OK?

38
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:05,800
I'm leaving

39
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:08,887
Ok, Ok! Why not see
if your boyfriend back?

40
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:12,432
Merv!

41
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:14,691
This is my roommate Michael,

42
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,854
which gives the impression of being who he really is

43
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:20,023
Wonderful!

44
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,068
Mervin, not disgust me

45
00:06:23,277 --> 00:06:26,572
It is usually gentle, but is a
little rude when you are drinking

46
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:29,659
or eating or talking.

47
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:33,288
He was the first friend I made
when I arrived one year ago

48
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:36,374
- By the way, I'm Tommy.
- Alan.

49
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:40,003
Who do you know here?

50
00:06:40,337 --> 00:06:42,756
I met Peter at
Tribune Los Angeles

51
00:06:43,048 --> 00:06:43,882
In the classifieds?

52
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:48,053
No, he negotiated the end
a strike for us

53
00:06:48,554 --> 00:06:50,222
and invited me and my
Head to celebrate

54
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:55,728
and a small group.
He invited me to come back at night.

55
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,356
So you're a writer?

56
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:00,358
Yes.

57
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:01,526
You write what?

58
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:03,236
I'm writing my first book.

59
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,406
- What is it?
- Ironically,

60
00:07:07,657 --> 00:07:09,993
homosexuality
throughout the ages.

61
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:13,914
Homosexuality has only
two ages: young, 29 years

62
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:19,795
I work for change
the negative image of gays.

63
00:07:20,046 --> 00:07:22,256
Michael is my biggest challenge.

64
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,886
Know, I would like to
interview him someday.

65
00:07:28,138 --> 00:07:29,931
This is something new.

66
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:31,266
Come on.

67
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:47,533
I gotta go.

68
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:49,869
See ya.

69
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,879
- Hello
- Can I talk to Tommy?

70
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,174
- Yes, who is?
- Alan Oakley, last night.

71
00:08:04,801 --> 00:08:07,429
- Oh, hi!
- I wonder if you want to have dinner with me?

72
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:11,225
- Of course! What time?

73
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,543
Hi, you should be Tommy?

74
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:39,463
Alan told me both of you!
Come in, please.

75
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:44,427
For me?

76
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:46,763
- How beautiful!

77
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:49,182
Who are you?

78
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:50,350
Beverly.

79
00:08:50,517 --> 00:08:51,476
Tommy, Hello!

80
00:08:52,978 --> 00:08:54,688
Sorry.

81
00:08:54,855 --> 00:08:55,689
About time!

82
00:08:56,189 --> 00:08:57,816
- This is rare.
- He met Beverly.

83
00:08:58,901 --> 00:09:00,861
Give presentations.

84
00:09:01,028 --> 00:09:03,113
Alan told me that you are gay.

85
00:09:03,148 --> 00:09:04,234
- Beverly!

86
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:06,826
Just because there's nothing good on TV.

87
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:10,413
- I find it so intriguing!

88
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:13,333
- Not always. Liberace, for example.

89
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,170
Liberace was gay?

90
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:19,589
Certainly, yes.

91
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:24,761
- Give it to me, thanks.
I'll look at the dinner.

92
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:27,932
- Why do not we met a little better.

93
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:37,108
- How was growing up in San Francisco?

94
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:39,819
- I'm from Texas.

95
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:40,904
- You do Valle?

96
00:09:42,072 --> 00:09:44,115
- You're so good!

97
00:09:45,367 --> 00:09:46,785
- I'm confused.

98
00:09:46,952 --> 00:09:51,415
Oh, I know honey. Probably you
had a very domineering mother.

99
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,670
- So, who planned to menu
tonight? A menage a trois?

100
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,839
- Oh, no...

101
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:01,133
Alan hates French food.

102
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,262
- You are unreal!

103
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:06,598
- What was that?

104
00:10:07,766 --> 00:10:11,228
- I said... you're a lion.

105
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:19,111
- I must be honest, I do not know many
gay...

106
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,823
Giorgio... except, my hairdresser.
He's so good!

107
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:24,909
- You do your hair?

108
00:10:25,451 --> 00:10:29,080
Not as many people. I myself do.

109
00:10:30,498 --> 00:10:31,666
- I loved it!
- Thanks.

110
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:36,129
- Oh, and Maurice, my
interior decorator.

111
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:39,466
he makes all sorts of... you know?

112
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:42,970
- You know him?

113
00:10:44,096 --> 00:10:46,348
- A fair color?

114
00:10:46,557 --> 00:10:47,683
- It's him!

115
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:52,605
- Let's connect...

116
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:56,442
- I'll bring my candles, my bells
and sing.

117
00:10:56,985 --> 00:10:59,154
- This is great...

118
00:11:02,907 --> 00:11:04,451
Are getting acquainted?

119
00:11:05,494 --> 00:11:08,288
Yes, I'm getting to know her.

120
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:11,667
Before you know it will
a guru around.

121
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:12,876
- I hope...

122
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,574
Huh?

123
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:17,381
She is a...

124
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:20,218
Shandi awaits us.

125
00:11:21,969 --> 00:11:23,805
Honey, dinner's ready.

126
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:33,357
So what you are, relatives?

127
00:11:33,732 --> 00:11:35,275
No.

128
00:11:35,609 --> 00:11:36,902
He is my lover.

129
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:39,405
- He is not a dream?

130
00:11:44,118 --> 00:11:45,912
I need to smoke a weed!

131
00:11:46,162 --> 00:11:47,997
- This looks good!

132
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:50,208
- You do not smoke weed, Beverly.

133
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:53,837
No, we do not smoke but the smoke gods

134
00:11:54,003 --> 00:11:56,590
American Indians smoke.

135
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,634
which brings us closer to our deep...

136
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,721
... Unconsciousness.

137
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:06,809
- And Shandi approve.
- You're so good!

138
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,566
- No, do not smoke marijuana.

139
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,818
- Come on, is like smoking a cigarette.

140
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,695
- I do not smoke cigarettes.

141
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:21,449
- Honestly Alan,
you are a slave to reality.

142
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,119
- Come on, no big deal...

143
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,122
if you are worried
with his political career

144
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,516
When he decided he wanted to be a writer? "

145
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,228
It has always been my dream since a child.

146
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:51,356
When he realized the
first time that he was gay?

147
00:12:51,732 --> 00:12:54,234
Well, it has always been my dream since childhood.

148
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:56,028
- Since I was a girl...

149
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:58,572
- His family knows he is working
for gay rights?

150
00:12:58,906 --> 00:13:01,826
They see me as a militant but
know it's something that I believe

151
00:13:01,992 --> 00:13:03,869
and are behind me

152
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:06,956
The only one who was always behind me
was the boot of my father

153
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:10,710
"Work, marry,
between the army. "

154
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:13,630
"Visit exciting places, meet
interesting people and then kill them! "

155
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:16,616
There is nothing worse than a military father.

156
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:19,302
always have guns at home.

157
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:22,806
once, he was 13, held a
and it accidentally fired.

158
00:13:24,516 --> 00:13:25,517
Killed Patton.

159
00:13:26,393 --> 00:13:27,561
Patton?

160
00:13:30,564 --> 00:13:32,191
Our parrot.

161
00:13:35,236 --> 00:13:37,238
I'll never forget his last words...

162
00:13:37,405 --> 00:13:38,990
"Patton wants a caixãol"

163
00:13:39,908 --> 00:13:42,494
I always remember the way he shook
every time I approach a weapon.

164
00:13:42,661 --> 00:13:44,287
I hear him scream...

165
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:49,251
Baby you never told me that!

166
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:51,920
- Where are you originally?
- Seguin, Texas.

167
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:56,092
Why come to Los Angeles and change
people's views about gays?

168
00:13:56,258 --> 00:13:58,803
It is as if Texas did not need
more than Los Angeles.

169
00:13:59,011 --> 00:14:00,722
It is bringing people together
in one place.

170
00:14:00,888 --> 00:14:04,058
but they just want to meet
the men's room of the library.

171
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:06,728
I also spent much time
men's bathroom in the library.

172
00:14:06,936 --> 00:14:08,688
When he had his first encounter gay?

173
00:14:11,316 --> 00:14:13,944
8th grade, January 12, 1968,

174
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:16,405
at 15:45. a Friday.

175
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:19,116
This is very accurate.

176
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:21,494
I was very precise.

177
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:24,705
Is something going on here.

178
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:32,881
This is a romantic encounter or what?

179
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:35,217
I thought he was.

180
00:14:39,221 --> 00:14:40,313
What?

181
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:43,892
He's kidding, honey.

182
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:47,877
No. I think not.

183
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:57,664
Now I understand why not
I wanted to here the principle

184
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:01,369
Because this is for my book

185
00:15:02,454 --> 00:15:04,289
I'm going home to pray for you, Alan.

186
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:11,839
Beverly, wait!

187
00:15:17,887 --> 00:15:20,890
I forgot to say something:
'Cocksucker! "

188
00:15:25,186 --> 00:15:26,396
This was an insult?

189
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,107
You're so cool!

190
00:15:29,316 --> 00:15:31,860
- Sorry, it was not my intention...
- Not so good.

191
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:34,530
I met her a few months
a club of young Republicans

192
00:15:34,696 --> 00:15:37,700
and thought it was normal

193
00:15:38,075 --> 00:15:40,870
I do not know when it became
lover of candles and Buddhist preacher...

194
00:15:41,912 --> 00:15:43,998
found in a Republican camp
and thought it was normal?

195
00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:46,167
what was that place?

196
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,752
I'm Republican.

197
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:55,468
You're kidding, right?

198
00:15:55,844 --> 00:15:57,888
Yes I am. Not much fun, is it?

199
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:04,395
I'm completely lost.

200
00:16:04,728 --> 00:16:07,106
Why a Republican straight

201
00:16:07,273 --> 00:16:08,899
write about homosexuality?

202
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,821
To provide an objective material
not obscure things.

203
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,699
You're stoned.

204
00:16:17,534 --> 00:16:19,202
I'm not.

205
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:21,580
Among!

206
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:36,596
You want a shotgun?

207
00:16:36,846 --> 00:16:37,889
A what?

208
00:16:38,306 --> 00:16:39,974
Come, open your mouth.

209
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:01,122
I think you should go...

210
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:05,460
Yes, yes, ok

211
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:10,381
Sorry.

212
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:54,929
Hi, sweetie.

213
00:17:55,513 --> 00:17:58,099
How was your big night?
I will not ask you how many times...

214
00:17:58,975 --> 00:18:02,562
he has a brother?
I'm saying, I have my pride.

215
00:18:02,729 --> 00:18:04,689
Remember, it was a disaster.

216
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:07,859
- What happened? Was too passive?
- Worst.

217
00:18:08,568 --> 00:18:12,114
- A hetero?
- Yes, but much worse.

218
00:18:12,698 --> 00:18:16,535
Oh my God!
What can be worse than a heterosexual?

219
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:18,078
He is Republican.

220
00:18:18,537 --> 00:18:19,914
He is a straight Republican!

221
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:21,457
Know otherwise?

222
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:27,130
Oh sorry dear, but when he
Judy Garland opened his mouth dropped!

223
00:18:32,052 --> 00:18:34,930
Sorry, did not want...

224
00:18:37,057 --> 00:18:38,892
was a tough split.

225
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,980
is a form of expression.

226
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:45,858
You want a massage?

227
00:18:46,817 --> 00:18:49,779
No thanks.
I have to go on a date.

228
00:19:26,318 --> 00:19:28,862
Remind me what we're doing here?

229
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:34,368
"Balance the conservative base
patriarchal society straight. "

230
00:19:34,743 --> 00:19:36,829
It's a good way to meet men.

231
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:39,415
Exactly. There comes a.

232
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:41,792
- What is this?
- A petition against Nixon.

233
00:19:42,168 --> 00:19:43,419
Nixon is innocent man!

234
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:47,674
I know! may believe that this half
the table does not belong to this lunatic.

235
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:48,891
What?

236
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:51,386
Subscribe to the mine. It is in support of Nixon.

237
00:19:52,345 --> 00:19:54,514
Why not subscribe?

238
00:19:54,681 --> 00:19:56,433
What is the problem with your friend?

239
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:59,436
The Communists are all crazy.
Is hunger.

240
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,356
Could you put your telefine too?

241
00:20:06,652 --> 00:20:07,904
Keep doing!

242
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:11,908
With you behind me... no problem.

243
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:15,161
- Alan!
- Tommy! Hi!

244
00:20:17,122 --> 00:20:18,874
How long? A month?

245
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,711
Do you think that is
his brother somewhere?

246
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,255
Think you're in the jungle?

247
00:20:26,548 --> 00:20:28,759
her love with this guy.

248
00:20:29,385 --> 00:20:31,137
"555"...

249
00:20:31,637 --> 00:20:34,140
This is not a prefix! Son of a bitch!

250
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:35,933
Lord!

251
00:20:38,853 --> 00:20:41,147
So what are you doing here?

252
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:44,150
I run here every morning.

253
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:48,113
- Many signatures?
- Not really.

254
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:51,325
There! Nixon won.

255
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:55,913
Plans for the night?

256
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,333
Or maybe you're busy with some setback
with the government?

257
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,627
There'll be busy. Why?

258
00:21:01,836 --> 00:21:06,799
Well, it's Saturday and would go with Beverly
until amazed.

259
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,302
I amazed?

260
00:21:09,511 --> 00:21:10,428
Yes.

261
00:21:10,845 --> 00:21:13,598
And I wanted to thank me with dinner?

262
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:15,934
Sure!

263
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:18,937
Alright!

264
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:27,655
I do not remember the last
time spent as well.

265
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:30,700
Shhh. It's a Republican
and never have so much fun.

266
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:34,829
There are still fights at shows hippies...

267
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:37,332
- It's my plant?
- Yes!

268
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:41,169
What happened. Was assumed that
talk to her twice a day

269
00:21:42,004 --> 00:21:43,338
- Hi, plant.

270
00:21:45,316 --> 00:21:46,206
- Hi, plant.

271
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,521
I'm a little tired.
I'd better go home.

272
00:21:59,063 --> 00:22:01,232
No! Why is not this evening.

273
00:22:02,525 --> 00:22:04,694
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

274
00:22:06,321 --> 00:22:07,698
I'll stay on the couch!

275
00:22:07,864 --> 00:22:09,825
No. I do not have to do this.

276
00:22:10,075 --> 00:22:11,034
No?

277
00:22:11,326 --> 00:22:15,998
This sofa is a mechanism of torture
for relatives who are not welcome

278
00:22:16,165 --> 00:22:17,792
Sleep in my bed.

279
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:22,088
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely true.

280
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:24,299
Okay.

281
00:22:25,925 --> 00:22:28,553
I'll stay on the couch, I'm used to.

282
00:22:34,309 --> 00:22:35,394
- Ok - Good evening.

283
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,052
What are you doing?

284
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,308
The couch is worse than I remembered.

285
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,520
I'll stay on the couch.

286
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,126
Good morning.

287
00:23:46,636 --> 00:23:48,555
I'll also have coffee

288
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:51,391
Usually all I get
is a false name and phone

289
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:54,147
- Last night was a disaster

290
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,631
Yes, I also had a good time.

291
00:23:58,774 --> 00:24:01,694
We need to give our brain a breather.

292
00:24:01,902 --> 00:24:03,195
So what are you doing tonight?

293
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:05,364
- I can not see you again.
- Here!

294
00:24:09,535 --> 00:24:11,162
- I assumed you'd take.

295
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:13,623
- I said I can not see you again.

296
00:24:14,082 --> 00:24:15,208
- Why?

297
00:24:17,002 --> 00:24:18,587
- Because I feel things for you.

298
00:24:19,755 --> 00:24:20,858
I think he knows it.

299
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:23,468
because they went to bed anyway.

300
00:24:26,494 --> 00:24:30,683
Come on, I was too drunk
do not remember anything

301
00:24:30,718 --> 00:24:31,731
You said:

302
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:33,307
"I'm so hot, I wanted
My fiancee was here. "

303
00:24:33,342 --> 00:24:34,921
I do not know who is speaking.

304
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:37,260
You know very well.

305
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:42,313
I would not stay with you
because you had been drinking.

306
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:45,240
I'm not queer like you, ok?

307
00:24:53,666 --> 00:24:55,409
Well, I'm very happy for you.

308
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:05,220
- Hello!
- Tommy?

309
00:25:05,386 --> 00:25:07,138
Listen, he does not want to talk to you.

310
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:10,100
Why do not you demand in
classified and calls another?

311
00:25:17,775 --> 00:25:21,612
American Psychiatric Association has classified
homosexuality as a mental illness.

312
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:23,364
Your signature can change that!

313
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:27,094
And...

314
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:27,272

... These sexual deviants.

336
00:25:31,331 --> 00:25:33,333
Homosexuality is not
a mental illness.

337
00:25:34,042 --> 00:25:35,752
You should be ashamed!

338
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:37,462
You should be ashamed of your thinking!

339
00:25:42,885 --> 00:25:45,721
Homosexuality is not
a mental illness.

340
00:25:46,682 --> 00:25:47,757
What kind!

341
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:49,697
Could only talk to him
a second, please?

342
00:25:49,732 --> 00:25:53,956
Listen, I'm going for a restraining order.
Do not call me anymore!

343
00:25:57,817 --> 00:25:58,860
- Faggot!

344
00:26:27,682 --> 00:26:31,645
Alan, is a contract potentially
very good, how can you resist?

345
00:26:32,688 --> 00:26:35,482
I dunno. Not simply
I feel good about it.

346
00:26:35,858 --> 00:26:38,193
It's best to get it out of the hands and mind.

347
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,488
You sign here and finish.

348
00:26:42,365 --> 00:26:44,492
I've known Larry a long time.

349
00:26:44,867 --> 00:26:46,953
Trust me, your book
is in better hands.

350
00:26:50,498 --> 00:26:51,791
I think that's right.

351
00:26:56,087 --> 00:26:59,216
Thank you for speaking
for Governor Reagan.

352
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:01,009
It will be a good article.

353
00:27:02,177 --> 00:27:03,262
Listen,

354
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:07,683
If you can do some
anything for you, just call me.

355
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:09,769
Thanks, has been a good friend.

356
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,523
Sorry.

357
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:23,033
What part of "not want to receive
a Christmas card "do you not understand?

358
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:24,493
Why still looking for me?

359
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:28,622
Do not want to see or hear again!

360
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:30,874
- I think I'll go.

361
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:35,588
- Tommy, what a surprise to see it!
- Talk to you later Alan.

362
00:27:38,382 --> 00:27:39,475
Whatever?

363
00:27:40,551 --> 00:27:42,679
I can not stop thinking about what happened.

364
00:27:42,845 --> 00:27:45,515
I want to apologize for the way I treated you.

365
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:48,977
- I finished my book...
- Does not interest me the fucking book!

366
00:27:49,436 --> 00:27:52,481
What do you want?

367
00:27:53,982 --> 00:27:56,026
I mean I'm sorry.

368
00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:02,158
Granted absolution, go
with God. Ta.

369
00:28:02,325 --> 00:28:04,118
- Wait!
- What?

370
00:28:06,746 --> 00:28:08,665
I also wanted
I mean... I...

371
00:28:11,084 --> 00:28:13,753
- They ate your tongue?
- Spit! Speak!

372
00:28:14,254 --> 00:28:15,380
Am out of here!

373
00:28:15,964 --> 00:28:18,800
I hope you have a
divine spiritual resignation.

374
00:28:25,224 --> 00:28:26,350
This will not happen...

375
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,978
Why I hate you.

376
00:28:32,607 --> 00:28:33,983
Now, fuck!

377
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:56,090
- I was so stunned that
I do not remember anything.

378
00:28:57,633 --> 00:28:59,594
- Shut up.

379
00:29:04,474 --> 00:29:07,269
Alan, I am. Calls me baby.

380
00:29:09,146 --> 00:29:10,772
I'm Dylan again. wanted to know...

381
00:29:18,572 --> 00:29:19,490
Larry Jenkins.

382
00:29:19,698 --> 00:29:21,993
- Hi I'm Alan Oakley.

383
00:29:22,702 --> 00:29:26,039
it just call you.

384
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:28,499
I wanted to talk about the book.

385
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:32,629
Yes, I also need to talk to you.
Listen, it's a great book

386
00:29:32,796 --> 00:29:35,924
but dont think it is a good time
to lance it and have a good exit

387
00:29:40,888 --> 00:29:43,474
Oh, that's good.
Oh my God this is great.

388
00:29:44,934 --> 00:29:46,685
Well, it's better than expected.

389
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:52,191
Listen. Can I call you
when done next?

390
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,901
I'll be waiting.

391
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,194
Ok, we talked.

392
00:30:02,786 --> 00:30:03,704
Hi Who was that?

393
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:06,290
My editor to say I
would not publish my book.

394
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:10,294
- Sorry.
I know how much it meant to you.

395
00:30:10,461 --> 00:30:11,754
It was no big deal.

396
00:30:12,755 --> 00:30:14,298
What are you talking about?

397
00:30:15,508 --> 00:30:17,593
Anyway not much care.

398
00:30:18,553 --> 00:30:20,555
He worked hard on it. I do not understand
a refusal to accept so easily!

399
00:30:20,763 --> 00:30:23,308
am I missing something?

400
00:30:26,144 --> 00:30:27,729
Can I read now?

401
00:30:28,021 --> 00:30:30,691
Just wanted to forget it.

402
00:30:32,224 --> 00:30:33,236
Ok!

403
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:37,448
This will cheer you.

404
00:30:51,963 --> 00:30:53,673
Not my type of reading.

405
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:56,551
Reading? I know what is new with this.

406
00:30:57,803 --> 00:30:59,847
So why not teach me anything.

407
00:31:03,142 --> 00:31:05,478
Lesson 1...

408
00:31:28,627 --> 00:31:29,878
No. Stop!

409
00:31:31,172 --> 00:31:33,466
- I do.

410
00:31:36,302 --> 00:31:38,638
- Coming!
- Not yet!

411
00:31:39,263 --> 00:31:41,266
- Come on Alan, do not let your mother waiting!

412
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,190
- I hear noises around. Open the door boy!

413
00:31:57,366 --> 00:31:58,492
- Good morning

414
00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:00,286
- Still in bed? Lord.

415
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:02,622
- At nine o'clock. What luxury!

416
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:05,833
What are you doing here?
I thought they were and Las Vegas?

417
00:32:06,042 --> 00:32:09,379
His father was not earning
, and decided it was better to go.

418
00:32:09,546 --> 00:32:12,549
We thought we could see you in San Diego.

419
00:32:12,757 --> 00:32:14,050
I do not think is the best time.

420
00:32:14,217 --> 00:32:17,471
We just want to see you.
God! You know I hate this city.

421
00:32:17,721 --> 00:32:19,890
Why do not we see better later?

422
00:32:20,391 --> 00:32:22,017
- Do not be ridiculous.

423
00:32:22,977 --> 00:32:25,229
Lift, lift. My parents are here!

424
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:26,989
- Great. I'm anxious to meet them.

425
00:32:27,056 --> 00:32:28,149
- Are you crazy?

426
00:32:28,357 --> 00:32:29,650
mad if you see!

427
00:32:29,859 --> 00:32:31,736
I'm so bad this morning?

428
00:32:31,903 --> 00:32:32,904
- Come on!

429
00:32:33,363 --> 00:32:35,782
- What do you do?
- Hide in the closet!

430
00:32:36,032 --> 00:32:38,243
Put me in a tomb
before I stick in a closet.

431
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,744
- I am only child.

432
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,372
My parents expect twenty grandchildren!
They can see you!

433
00:32:42,706 --> 00:32:45,083
Can face their parents.

434
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,128
I'm tired of your dirty little secrets.

435
00:32:48,295 --> 00:32:50,422
Never left. No response
to my phone...

436
00:32:57,221 --> 00:32:59,557
Sorry. I did not notice.

437
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:02,102
This is my friend Tommy.

438
00:33:02,394 --> 00:33:03,937
It was this night to sleep because...

439
00:33:04,646 --> 00:33:06,398
You are painting the apartment.

440
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,318
His mother is not stupid.
She knows what is happening here.

441
00:33:12,112 --> 00:33:16,450
My roommate had many
guests. So we came here.

442
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:18,828
And he said:

443
00:33:19,036 --> 00:33:21,789
I'll stay on the couch. Generous as it is,

444
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:25,084
He said stay with the bed,
and me on the couch.

445
00:33:26,002 --> 00:33:27,796
Well, that was very sweet of you.

446
00:33:28,421 --> 00:33:32,467
Do not worry about the coffee.
I will prepare.

447
00:33:32,968 --> 00:33:34,928
I'll leave you to dress.

448
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,974
I liked the hat.

449
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:40,851
Dress!

450
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,815
How was Vegas?

451
00:33:46,565 --> 00:33:50,069
Full of drunks, party animals and
punters until dawn

452
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,907
Met there. In good times!

453
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:57,770
I was a dancer at the Flamingo
and Ted was on leave from the navy.

454
00:33:57,805 --> 00:34:00,286
She was so beautiful with his uniform.

455
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:02,749
You were a dancer in Las Vegas, i
sso is so cool

456
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,484
He met an Ann Margret?

457
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:09,527
No, but used his colan. The girls and I
were doing a tribute to Elvis...

458
00:34:09,562 --> 00:34:10,450
Mary...

459
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:15,137
How did you meet?

460
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,890
In the Young Republicans club.

461
00:34:18,558 --> 00:34:20,143
I love cock.

462
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:24,606
It has too much sugar.

463
00:34:26,316 --> 00:34:28,026
Nixon is a good man.

464
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:31,530
I like to see young people supporting the team.

465
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:35,200
though somewhat liberal
in some subjects

466
00:34:35,209 --> 00:34:36,802
anyway it is a good man.

467
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:46,078
Alan, there's something you want to tell us?

468
00:34:47,425 --> 00:34:48,749
I think not.

469
00:34:49,507 --> 00:34:51,927
Can I read some new kind of reading?

470
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,781
I can not explain.

471
00:34:53,816 --> 00:34:55,281
I think I should do it.

472
00:34:55,316 --> 00:34:56,823
Due to his mother for an explanation.

473
00:34:57,474 --> 00:34:58,308
His father

474
00:34:58,517 --> 00:35:00,686
want to know when you will publish your book.

475
00:35:02,146 --> 00:35:03,522
.. O. o. .. o. .. book?

476
00:35:05,608 --> 00:35:07,610
Still do not know anything.

477
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:08,871
Not sure?

478
00:35:09,582 --> 00:35:11,058
Move your ass there!

479
00:35:11,093 --> 00:35:12,625
- Ted!
- Make some calls!

480
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,430
A little initiative!

481
00:35:15,935 --> 00:35:20,419
Ted, you go.
His father did not want to miss Kojak.

482
00:35:22,751 --> 00:35:23,794
- Who loves you, Baby?

483
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:26,171
Gonna take a trip to visit them.

484
00:35:26,422 --> 00:35:28,674
Yes, and will continue postponing, for a change.

485
00:35:28,924 --> 00:35:30,634
Pleasure to meet you, Tommy.

486
00:35:30,801 --> 00:35:32,261
It was also a pleasure to meet them.

487
00:35:33,638 --> 00:35:37,648
Oh Your magazine was wetting
and I put next to the sofa for you

488
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:43,523
I think they liked me.

489
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,524
Oh my God!

490
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:46,735
What's wrong with your book?

491
00:35:46,985 --> 00:35:48,612
I thought the editor did not like.

492
00:35:49,071 --> 00:35:51,031
Only asked you to help me.

493
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:54,076
I do not believe he left a
porn magazine for my mom to see!

494
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:56,120
Well, not me who got wet...

495
00:35:56,912 --> 00:35:58,039
You little shit!

496
00:35:58,331 --> 00:35:59,665
Case closed.

497
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:01,375
Dipshit!

498
00:36:01,751 --> 00:36:03,127
Case closed

499
00:36:09,134 --> 00:36:11,303
"All you presisa is love"

500
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,682
"The homosexual love is beautiful"

501
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:26,944
"The Lesbians are beautiful"

502
00:36:37,706 --> 00:36:41,585
"Save our children from homosexuality"

503
00:36:45,297 --> 00:36:47,007
"Save our human rights"

504
00:36:47,216 --> 00:36:48,634
"Repent"

505
00:36:51,053 --> 00:36:52,346
"God loves us"

506
00:36:55,391 --> 00:36:56,976
"Human rights are absolute"

507
00:36:57,185 --> 00:36:58,353
"An army of fans can not fail"

508
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:10,365
"Gay Power, Black Power, Power of Women...

509
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:11,617
... Power of Students. All Power to the People. "

510
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:23,212
Ahhh, wait...

511
00:37:23,504 --> 00:37:24,631
Because he asked?

512
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:27,258
I'll go back to the car.

513
00:37:36,727 --> 00:37:38,354
Unbelievable!

514
00:37:40,147 --> 00:37:43,234
How about if we make the trip
we talk to mexico?

515
00:37:44,652 --> 00:37:46,946
There we took a holiday in the four
years we are together.

516
00:37:47,321 --> 00:37:50,033
Mexico. you know I hate.
- We can fly.

517
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:52,243
If fly is not the same.

518
00:37:52,452 --> 00:37:54,204
We did not seize the trip alone.

519
00:37:55,288 --> 00:37:57,165
Oh no! Come on!

520
00:38:02,629 --> 00:38:03,881
Hey, Alan!

521
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,050
- Are you okay?
- Hi!

522
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:09,762
- Jesus! Long time!

523
00:38:10,346 --> 00:38:14,016
Beverly, so long
that not recognize you. Changed much

524
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:17,566
You are also different.

525
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:21,483
Yes, we decided to change their jogging.
Their form is fantastic.

526
00:38:21,525 --> 00:38:26,104
Thank you. Keep in shape with a
video gym that I am at home.

527
00:38:26,113 --> 00:38:27,823
Home video of gymnastics?
How's this?

528
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:30,701
Imagine wanting to exercise in
home instead of going to the gym,

529
00:38:30,868 --> 00:38:33,996
You put the video-cassette
and accompanies the instructor.

530
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:36,666
Not a good idea?

531
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:38,584
Yes, it was good to see you.

532
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:39,669
Yeah, you too.

533
00:38:39,836 --> 00:38:41,838
Should come to our apartment
for dinner one day.

534
00:38:42,297 --> 00:38:44,883
"Our apartment? Are living together?

535
00:38:45,258 --> 00:38:47,344
Yes, they do four years.

536
00:38:48,386 --> 00:38:49,804
I knew it.

537
00:38:50,013 --> 00:38:51,890
It was very good cook to be straight!

538
00:38:53,016 --> 00:38:54,434
Just sing anything, ok?

539
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,145
Oh, it was a phase...

540
00:38:56,353 --> 00:38:57,354
... I was going through.

541
00:38:57,521 --> 00:39:00,065
Now go to the church of Scientology.
I became...

542
00:39:00,274 --> 00:39:01,901
a new world.

543
00:39:02,193 --> 00:39:03,194
Sounds interesting.

544
00:39:03,402 --> 00:39:05,530
- It is!
- We need to...

545
00:39:05,738 --> 00:39:08,992
Listen! I also have to
run. Has the same number?

546
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,619
- Yes!
_ Good! I'll call you, bye.

547
00:39:14,164 --> 00:39:15,957
- Great, thanks.

548
00:39:18,085 --> 00:39:19,169
Where's Michael?

549
00:39:24,116 --> 00:39:25,021
Excuse me.

550
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:30,473
AUUUU! That hurt motherfucker!

551
00:39:30,806 --> 00:39:33,768
Drop the candy and pass
away from the boys.

552
00:39:37,146 --> 00:39:41,818
Please finish alone.
This was not funny!

553
00:39:42,485 --> 00:39:44,029
Guys, wait!

554
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,619
I went out with Alan

555
00:39:50,828 --> 00:39:52,830
but deep down always knew he was gay.

556
00:39:53,122 --> 00:39:56,667
Oh, I loved it. Took
both to end!

557
00:39:59,295 --> 00:40:02,840
That happened to me too.
I want a stable relationship.

558
00:40:03,216 --> 00:40:05,176
I am not a prostitute.

559
00:40:05,552 --> 00:40:06,469
I'll get something fresh.

560
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:09,973
I want one for chronic
sleep on the last page.

561
00:40:11,308 --> 00:40:12,476
Excuse me.

562
00:40:13,769 --> 00:40:15,479
Larry, are you doing here?

563
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:19,108
I'm trying to find two weeks ago.
I have good news

564
00:40:19,275 --> 00:40:22,945
After the recent events in
Florida, decided to publish his book

565
00:40:23,237 --> 00:40:27,005
I have nothing to do with this book. That was a long
time and I do not believe that anymore.

566
00:40:27,408 --> 00:40:29,410
Certainly not want my
name associated with something.

567
00:40:29,577 --> 00:40:33,623
- Alan, commenting is a big mistake.
- No. It was a pleasure to see you.

568
00:40:35,625 --> 00:40:38,003
What a change! You're popular.

569
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,631
Most are friends of Tommy.

570
00:40:40,923 --> 00:40:42,216
Thanks for doing this again for us

571
00:40:42,382 --> 00:40:44,843
It is a pleasure. Oh, before I forget...

572
00:40:45,302 --> 00:40:48,472
These are the house keys...
Thanks for taking care of her.

573
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,558
No problem. What can I do for you.

574
00:40:51,309 --> 00:40:53,519
Where's the incendiary bomb

575
00:40:53,895 --> 00:40:57,732
Who knows? Signing autographs
and kisses, I think...

576
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,695
Looks like you guys to give
well after 4 years.

577
00:41:01,945 --> 00:41:04,489
It is easy to live without others in our house

578
00:41:05,657 --> 00:41:06,867
Interesting, no?

579
00:41:07,117 --> 00:41:11,789
When we drastically change our
life, just the influence of a person.

580
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:13,165
What do you mean?

581
00:41:13,457 --> 00:41:16,085
What should be driving to The
Tribune now. I would not be happy...

582
00:41:16,419 --> 00:41:17,879
Excuse me...

583
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:20,548
have you seen my boyfriend? I think I lost it.

584
00:41:20,715 --> 00:41:22,842
How is he?

585
00:41:23,009 --> 00:41:27,222
.. Well, it's beautiful, elegant,
successful, lovely,

586
00:41:27,597 --> 00:41:28,473
beautiful.

587
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:30,976
Oh! And how can someone
well on your side?

588
00:41:31,143 --> 00:41:32,895
I could not find a better one.

589
00:41:33,061 --> 00:41:34,646
Oh, shit!

590
00:41:48,912 --> 00:41:51,164
- Where are you taking me?
- It's a secret.

591
00:41:51,456 --> 00:41:53,041
Secret?

592
00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:55,377
- Yes!
Do you love secrets.

593
00:41:56,753 --> 00:41:58,046
Sit here.

594
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,676
Close your eyes.

595
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:05,763
Do not make jokes. Close
eyes and turn around.

596
00:42:10,852 --> 00:42:12,019
Do not look.

597
00:42:23,323 --> 00:42:24,825
Happy birthday.

598
00:42:27,161 --> 00:42:30,289
- This is an "A". You missed.
- No. They are our initials!

599
00:42:30,456 --> 00:42:33,459
I know. Thank you. I loved it.

600
00:42:38,798 --> 00:42:40,049
One more thing...

601
00:42:44,637 --> 00:42:46,139
A photo of an Oldsmobile.

602
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:48,934
Too pretentious for a Volkswagen?

603
00:42:49,976 --> 00:42:52,187
It is also his and arrives next week.

604
00:42:53,063 --> 00:42:54,064
Are you kidding?

605
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:55,482
It's yours!

606
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,403
- We can not afford.
- We can, I saved.

607
00:42:59,612 --> 00:43:01,072
I can not accept.

608
00:43:01,238 --> 00:43:04,033
Have no choice! Already
paid and no refund.

609
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:06,911
See, it's for us two.

610
00:43:07,078 --> 00:43:07,996
No.

611
00:43:08,204 --> 00:43:09,255
Yes.

612
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:11,833
- No.
- Yes!

613
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:18,674
So it's easier.

614
00:43:19,424 --> 00:43:21,385
Any idea how much I love you?

615
00:43:21,844 --> 00:43:23,304
No, but you can show me.

616
00:43:36,568 --> 00:43:38,653
- How could you do this to me?

617
00:43:38,862 --> 00:43:42,866
- Alan, signed a contract with me
4 years ago. This is perfectly legal.

618
00:43:43,158 --> 00:43:47,746
The timing was very good practical
let go and not put your name.

619
00:43:47,996 --> 00:43:50,875
What is the complaint of having a best
seller, a young boy?

620
00:43:53,377 --> 00:43:57,215
Hear that "The citizens of Dade County,
in Florida, voted by a margin of 2-1...

621
00:43:57,381 --> 00:44:01,177
to refuse an amendment in the law that prohibits
discrimination against homosexuals.

622
00:44:01,594 --> 00:44:05,432
"Before that, the singer Anita Bryant
made a public campaign

623
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,310
against the bill to the nation.

624
00:44:08,602 --> 00:44:10,979
After his statement, Bryant said:

625
00:44:11,188 --> 00:44:15,818
"God help us, we will reject
These laws across the nation. "

626
00:44:17,236 --> 00:44:21,324
This book of shit "The truth straight"
and Anita Bryant will be a big problem.

627
00:44:22,783 --> 00:44:26,788
I do not know, I meet David Metzner
tonight to discuss how to control damage.

628
00:44:28,164 --> 00:44:29,499
See you there.

629
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,096
Why not told you the truth?

630
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,808
say wrote the book number
1 of hatred in the nation? Can not make it.

631
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,897
I suppose all this will calm and
nobody will know it was you.

632
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:53,149
but do not think it's better to be honest?

633
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:55,568
It would be easier to take the books
the shelves!

634
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:58,071
Have to face it, Alan.

635
00:44:59,573 --> 00:45:00,740
That's right.

636
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:03,493
Just talk. He will understand.

637
00:45:04,578 --> 00:45:07,206
I hope so. Thank you.

638
00:45:10,464 --> 00:45:18,856
"TRUTH HETERO" WHO IS THE TRUE AUTHOR? The battle for gay rights in
Florida has made "The truth straight" a best seller, but the author remains a mystery

639
00:45:22,055 --> 00:45:23,139
Where is it?

640
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:25,642
Here.

641
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:30,564
I do not want luck?

642
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:34,568
I need to tell you something.

643
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:36,737
What?

644
00:45:38,572 --> 00:45:39,573
What is it?

645
00:45:46,372 --> 00:45:47,749
Devastate them.

646
00:45:49,209 --> 00:45:50,418
Thank you, see you tonight.

647
00:45:59,762 --> 00:46:03,474
Bryant's move to end
equal rights for gays in Florida...

648
00:46:03,641 --> 00:46:05,101
... Extended nationally.

649
00:46:05,176 --> 00:46:07,520
We are here with Tommy Ballenger, "High and Strong"
a group fighting to avoid...

650
00:46:07,687 --> 00:46:12,025
... That this cross-Bryant
come to California.

651
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,818
Mr Ballenger,

652
00:46:14,027 --> 00:46:18,240
What The 'Tall and Strong "flaps do to avoid
that this crusade is to extend nationwide

653
00:46:18,532 --> 00:46:22,411
"I think the best thing to do
is to teach all about diversity.

654
00:46:22,911 --> 00:46:24,872
Teem People fear what they do not understand.

655
00:46:25,372 --> 00:46:27,708
- Have you read the book "The straight truth"?

656
00:46:27,916 --> 00:46:31,420
It was obviously written by a
Christian aiming to harm us.

657
00:46:31,629 --> 00:46:33,673
Why do you think was published anonymously?

658
00:46:34,131 --> 00:46:35,675
Some words to quit?

659
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:37,677
Yes, thanks.

660
00:46:38,136 --> 00:46:41,055
I wanted to do according to un
Anita Bryant's friends:

661
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:45,810
If you stop telling lies about us,
stop telling the truth about you

662
00:46:46,812 --> 00:46:50,148
Rushed an incident during an interview
with reporters. And this is what happened

663
00:46:50,315 --> 00:46:51,775
Our crusade
against homosexuals

664
00:46:51,984 --> 00:46:55,321
Could start on June 8
After our great victory.

665
00:47:01,994 --> 00:47:04,998
But we wanted to avoid
and win it in Virginia

666
00:47:05,164 --> 00:47:08,626
We talked to Norfolk
with protesters

667
00:47:08,793 --> 00:47:11,838
and face all sorts of problems e. ..

668
00:47:16,097 --> 00:47:17,194
- Security.

669
00:47:17,594 --> 00:47:21,054
- Hurt?
- No. At least it was fruit cake.

670
00:47:36,906 --> 00:47:41,995
Yes, I would like to give the name
the author of "The Straight Truth"...

671
00:47:42,412 --> 00:47:45,582
I wanted to stay anonymous.

672
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:48,085
Mr. Ballenger, it was revealed that the
author of "The straight truth is Alan Oakley,

673
00:47:48,294 --> 00:47:51,922
Who lives with you for four years.

674
00:47:52,089 --> 00:47:53,883
Any comments?

675
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:57,679
This was a plan to make money
the controversy with Anita Bryant?

676
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:02,517
Or a plan to attract supporters?

677
00:48:02,809 --> 00:48:06,521
Tell the truth honestly:
Alan Oakley is your lover?

678
00:48:08,565 --> 00:48:13,230
Listen. Farrah Fawcett made in his
thighs. If you do not go away

679
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:16,509
I'll stick this microphone so deep...

680
00:48:20,828 --> 00:48:22,663
Oh! Her hair is awful, baby!

681
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:26,209
Cut!

682
00:48:28,086 --> 00:48:31,256
No newspaper in the country, except
will want to gossip

683
00:48:31,798 --> 00:48:35,844
maintaining a journalist who writes
against the rights of others

684
00:48:36,428 --> 00:48:38,639
Not supposed to be published.

685
00:48:38,931 --> 00:48:42,101
A real journalist would never write
something that could not be published!

686
00:48:42,268 --> 00:48:45,062
A true writer should
be responsible for your words!

687
00:48:45,479 --> 00:48:47,607
Until his father agrees with that.

688
00:48:47,982 --> 00:48:49,400
You have created...

689
00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:51,611
an atmosphere of anarchy around.

690
00:48:51,986 --> 00:48:54,239
We have protests outside the building!

691
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:57,909
The phones are congested
death threats!

692
00:48:58,285 --> 00:49:00,787
I have no choice but to let you go.

693
00:49:50,423 --> 00:49:52,300
Anything you want me to say?

694
00:50:21,623 --> 00:50:23,041
Sorry.

695
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,644
"Stop the attacks on gays!"

696
00:51:29,737 --> 00:51:33,032
"One reason for revolting!"

697
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:45,296
"Cancer on the gay community"

698
00:51:47,882 --> 00:51:49,633
"Alliance of People with AIDS"

699
00:51:56,724 --> 00:51:57,976
"Fighting for Our Lives"

700
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,571
Excuse me...

701
00:52:10,489 --> 00:52:11,782
Excuse me...

702
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:14,326
Honey, in a minute you meet.

703
00:52:16,579 --> 00:52:18,581
"Out loud," I can help you...

704
00:52:19,207 --> 00:52:21,918
Yes, Mr. Oakley
will speak during dinner.

705
00:52:22,543 --> 00:52:24,379
No, he is single but I am.

706
00:52:25,422 --> 00:52:26,923
No, I'm not a lesbian!

707
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:30,469
Well, since my friend and I...

708
00:52:33,138 --> 00:52:35,098
You know, I can see two guys doing...

709
00:52:35,265 --> 00:52:37,393
because they have nowhere to hold.

710
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:39,019
But two women?

711
00:52:42,398 --> 00:52:43,566
Oh my God. There is a lesbian, is it?

712
00:52:44,442 --> 00:52:45,318
No.

713
00:52:47,445 --> 00:52:49,822
I can only conjure up a department for me.

714
00:52:52,117 --> 00:52:53,827
The Department of Defense.

715
00:52:54,244 --> 00:52:56,538
He is the one of our programs

716
00:52:56,705 --> 00:53:00,751
which will increase its budget heading

717
00:53:02,294 --> 00:53:06,715
Better close your mouth and open it
when it is correct.

718
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:09,802
It is the only president ever
giving bad news to the American people.

719
00:53:10,094 --> 00:53:12,054
It is a Republican. What do you expect.

720
00:53:12,221 --> 00:53:15,350
With the Germans
We do not talk of war.

721
00:53:15,892 --> 00:53:18,144
If I remember correctly
you were one of those Republicans.

722
00:53:18,353 --> 00:53:21,189
If I remember you'd be a prostitute!

723
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:23,024
I love your outfit.

724
00:53:23,275 --> 00:53:25,027
It's as Crystal Carrington ":

725
00:53:25,444 --> 00:53:27,654
type "I am really sweet
but you yank your eyes!

726
00:53:27,988 --> 00:53:30,449
Thank you. their clothes are so stunning.

727
00:53:30,658 --> 00:53:33,202
Oh, this? My style prostitute?

728
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:37,498
Do I shock you. Only
people who are alive.

729
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,047
Righteous man who was looking for!

730
00:53:44,214 --> 00:53:47,884
Only if it is heterosexual, I know!
What are you doing here?

731
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:51,638
I came to see beautiful beautiful friend.

732
00:53:52,264 --> 00:53:53,307
What happened?

733
00:54:03,067 --> 00:54:06,404
A phone number and a
address in Mexico. Lets guess...

734
00:54:07,572 --> 00:54:09,365
The man of my dreams is there.

735
00:54:10,158 --> 00:54:13,453
Beverly is thrilled that his I
with these types of relationships...

736
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,164
... But let me be the first to tell you.
It will not work.

737
00:54:16,623 --> 00:54:18,375
is the address and phone number for Tommy.

738
00:54:20,669 --> 00:54:22,004
Come on!

739
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:25,007
You did the right thing with the gay community,
do the right thing with it too!

740
00:54:26,801 --> 00:54:27,843
He hates me.

741
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:30,263
Is that you hate yourself.

742
00:54:31,639 --> 00:54:34,267
I can not.
I have to write my speech

743
00:54:34,434 --> 00:54:36,644
and I think that Peter plans
something for my birthday

744
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:38,938
He is sick, Alan.

745
00:54:39,731 --> 00:54:43,694
Michael asked me who told you
and it is not easy for me.

746
00:54:43,985 --> 00:54:47,114
He goes in his parents' house after
tomorrow and wanted to see before leaving

747
00:54:47,656 --> 00:54:48,699
No, I can not.

748
00:54:50,618 --> 00:54:52,036
Gotta go home.

749
00:54:55,081 --> 00:54:56,791
Home to what?

750
00:54:57,041 --> 00:54:57,959
- Alan!

751
00:55:10,681 --> 00:55:12,599
Mary, is Beverly.

752
00:55:12,975 --> 00:55:14,393
We need to help your child.

753
00:55:20,649 --> 00:55:22,360
There! So you're a lesbian!

754
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:24,111
I had a great idea.

755
00:55:24,695 --> 00:55:26,030
Okay sister!

756
00:55:58,606 --> 00:55:59,816
Are you coming to bed?

757
00:56:00,734 --> 00:56:01,735
One minute.

758
00:56:04,196 --> 00:56:06,156
Damn manufacturers...

759
00:56:06,323 --> 00:56:09,702
will not finish this
gate until Tuesday.

760
00:56:10,035 --> 00:56:13,539
I wanted to finish before
My parents arrive tomorrow!

761
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:18,002
His parents come tomorrow?

762
00:56:18,503 --> 00:56:22,048
Yes, you have to change their stuff
for another quarter.

763
00:56:22,715 --> 00:56:25,760
Oh, has a new suit for that use.
Is stored in the cabinet.

764
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:29,139
I go to sleep. Good night.

765
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,831
What is this?

766
00:56:52,998 --> 00:56:56,251
Are the keys to my BMW. It is your
I'll buy a new one.

767
00:56:56,418 --> 00:56:57,419
Stop essse present, ok?

768
00:56:57,753 --> 00:57:00,297
I'm perfectly happy with my car.

769
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:04,802
Alan is a Honda,
how can you be happy with that?

770
00:57:06,846 --> 00:57:08,347
We are not so well.

771
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,434
Are you kidding? Could not be better!

772
00:57:11,601 --> 00:57:14,729
- The firm has not lost any process...
- I'm talking about us, Peter!

773
00:57:15,438 --> 00:57:16,689
We are far away.

774
00:57:17,565 --> 00:57:19,568
Takes you to the Cape once you have some time.

775
00:57:19,943 --> 00:57:21,737
I do not think this is
the solution of our problem.

776
00:57:23,238 --> 00:57:25,699
- I can not believe it! This law firm
shit is having so much trouble.

777
00:57:39,213 --> 00:57:43,051
Hope this helps you with your computer
their work. With love, Peter

778
00:57:50,142 --> 00:57:51,476
Hi, plan!

779
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:10,956
Father, you should do
a trip to China...

780
00:58:11,164 --> 00:58:13,208
by 60 years of marriage.

781
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:15,794
- What?
- China Father!

782
00:58:16,128 --> 00:58:17,713
I do not care what we eat

783
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,300
Just tell your wife to
cook faster!

784
00:58:21,508 --> 00:58:23,260
This is Peter, not Martin.

785
00:58:23,427 --> 00:58:25,888
Peter is not married. Remember, George.

786
00:58:26,389 --> 00:58:27,974
Why not get married?

787
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:32,228
Why is too busy with work.
He has no time for dating.

788
00:58:32,937 --> 00:58:37,692
Alan, have not seen his girlfriend
Peter tells us that much.

789
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:40,237
She walks very busy with work.

790
00:58:40,403 --> 00:58:43,323
Have to thank President
Reagan for that!

791
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:46,160
Oh, we have to thank
President Reagan's a lot of things.

792
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:52,541
I got it.

793
00:58:56,671 --> 00:58:58,172
Good couple!

794
00:59:02,218 --> 00:59:04,304
Surprise!

795
00:59:04,471 --> 00:59:06,431
- What is this?
- Happy birthday!

796
00:59:06,598 --> 00:59:07,766
Not a good time.

797
00:59:07,933 --> 00:59:10,018
What this, funeral music?

798
00:59:10,185 --> 00:59:12,813
Until we have music lifts
better than this.

799
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,972
It's your birthday

800
00:59:13,981 --> 00:59:17,485
and decided to come and celebrate.

801
00:59:18,235 --> 00:59:21,072
We want free beer.

802
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:23,533
Her mother is single and ready to party.

803
00:59:23,741 --> 00:59:24,575
Mommy!

804
00:59:24,867 --> 00:59:28,538
This is what made the show Caesar's Palace.

805
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,498
C'mon, Mama!

806
00:59:30,665 --> 00:59:32,250
No, Peter's parents are here!

807
00:59:32,793 --> 00:59:34,044
Get them out then!

808
00:59:34,252 --> 00:59:35,212
Could not come at another
moment, please?

809
00:59:35,282 --> 00:59:38,077
I can not believe
invited them and not us!

810
00:59:39,967 --> 00:59:42,136
He is a bad boy.

811
00:59:42,303 --> 00:59:44,889
Yes, let's save in the room.

812
00:59:47,058 --> 00:59:48,976
- Mom, do not touch anything...

813
01:00:04,493 --> 01:00:06,036
I thought Peter would appreciate it.

814
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:08,080
Yes, if Peter needs a bitch.

815
01:00:08,247 --> 01:00:11,500
Come on. I'll make some money
way home.

816
01:00:12,043 --> 01:00:13,044
What's happening?

817
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:15,379
Why not call your mother?

818
01:00:15,546 --> 01:00:17,465
You would realize that their
parents are divorcing.

819
01:00:17,632 --> 01:00:20,051
Yes but I think it's fine.

820
01:00:21,511 --> 01:00:23,263
His real gift.

821
01:00:23,763 --> 01:00:26,349
I thought you would like a short vacation.

822
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:38,154
- I said I can not
- Your flight leaves in 3 hours.

823
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,699
Arrive in time to drink
some margaritas in Mexico.

824
01:00:42,033 --> 01:00:44,035
And Tommy would fly to Texas.

825
01:00:44,202 --> 01:00:46,538
- I can not go.
- Why?

826
01:00:47,747 --> 01:00:49,749
Because Peter does not like it.

827
01:00:51,418 --> 01:00:53,378
"Peter will not like this"

828
01:00:53,445 --> 01:00:54,496
Beverly!

829
01:00:54,563 --> 01:00:58,258
Alan! Peter does not like you
feels in his face and crush.

830
01:00:58,967 --> 01:01:01,720
Come on, Let go of the teat. Jump
head, just for a change!

831
01:01:01,887 --> 01:01:04,390
He helped me when nobody else did, ok.

832
01:01:08,436 --> 01:01:10,021
... It's a small baby
It's baby Peter.

833
01:01:11,981 --> 01:01:13,608
I said I can not go.

834
01:01:13,775 --> 01:01:15,318
Grow up and be a man.
Stand and you change your mind!

835
01:01:19,865 --> 01:01:21,366
What's happening?

836
01:01:22,492 --> 01:01:24,578
Sound of people of color!

837
01:01:24,745 --> 01:01:27,206
I'll see what is happening.

838
01:01:30,042 --> 01:01:32,628
- Are you working?
- Yes and no.

839
01:01:32,795 --> 01:01:34,589
But the night is young!

840
01:01:41,388 --> 01:01:43,348
Let's not tonight.

841
01:01:43,557 --> 01:01:44,933
Dance with us.

842
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:47,519
Let's not be so bitter.
It is equal to his father.

843
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:49,771
I do not thereby created.

844
01:01:53,317 --> 01:01:55,361
I hope it's not too expensive!

845
01:01:55,653 --> 01:01:56,570
Was!

846
01:01:56,737 --> 01:01:58,739
I said I could not stay.

847
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:00,324
I can not believe you invited

848
01:02:00,533 --> 01:02:02,994
their parents for the birthday and not ours.

849
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:04,871
It's your birthday?

850
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:08,833
Well, I arrived just in time.

851
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,585
What's for dinner?

852
01:02:10,794 --> 01:02:13,922
- We do not have enough.
- We know that there is always more than you need.

853
01:02:20,596 --> 01:02:22,932
Why not take his eyes off the clock?

854
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,892
Is excellent.

855
01:02:25,268 --> 01:02:26,936
You can cook, Alan.

856
01:02:27,053 --> 01:02:28,104
Thank you.

857
01:02:28,271 --> 01:02:30,607
Wine, yes, please.

858
01:02:33,693 --> 01:02:34,652
I'll take another.

859
01:02:35,236 --> 01:02:37,656
It was less drunk?

860
01:02:38,106 --> 01:02:39,157
I will try,

861
01:02:39,366 --> 01:02:41,410
but no promises.

862
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:44,913
Is ready for his big
speech tomorrow night?

863
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:45,956
How exciting

864
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:48,292
Practice with us!

865
01:02:48,709 --> 01:02:50,795
- Dad, and golf?
- He will talk...

866
01:02:51,003 --> 01:02:54,006
the crisis of public health in the Reagan administration.

867
01:02:54,173 --> 01:02:55,800
Should be proud, Peter.

868
01:02:56,050 --> 01:03:00,346
We can not have this conversation
the table tonight?

869
01:03:01,348 --> 01:03:03,558
Where is the father of Alan?

870
01:03:03,975 --> 01:03:06,228
Probably know some bitch.

871
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:08,814
He should have left him long ago.

872
01:03:09,022 --> 01:03:10,858
Else was so good in bed!

873
01:03:11,108 --> 01:03:13,277
Sometimes he could only stand

874
01:03:13,485 --> 01:03:15,946
Nobody here is interested.

875
01:03:16,113 --> 01:03:17,181
Lower your voice!

876
01:03:17,698 --> 01:03:18,866
We are not deaf.

877
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:22,578
At least it could be of interest
on the welfare of my son!

878
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:25,081
Respect the interests of all Alan,

879
01:03:25,373 --> 01:03:28,126
just do not like to force me to swallow them.

880
01:03:28,293 --> 01:03:33,674
This is the first time I hear you
My son complained of forcing you to swallow anything?

881
01:03:34,758 --> 01:03:36,635
I have to put up with it.

882
01:03:36,844 --> 01:03:38,762
... Go complain to the bishop.

883
01:03:39,722 --> 01:03:41,307
You crossed the line.

884
01:03:41,515 --> 01:03:43,434
First comes into my house...

885
01:03:43,643 --> 01:03:44,652
Your household?

886
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:47,522
I forgot. Do you live alone.

887
01:03:49,273 --> 01:03:50,650
Do not do it.

888
01:03:51,317 --> 01:03:52,402
Do not make the same mistake...

889
01:03:52,610 --> 01:03:54,362
I made with her father.

890
01:03:55,447 --> 01:03:57,991
I love you and support you...

891
01:03:58,617 --> 01:04:01,787
But I can not sit here
and see how it destroys your life.

892
01:04:01,995 --> 01:04:04,164
If you are now going to take time.

893
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:07,334
A time for what? He's not going anywhere.

894
01:04:10,463 --> 01:04:14,384
This dinner is over.
I want everybody out of here now!

895
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:15,718
Do not shout.

896
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,345
- Come on, George.
- Do not shout!

897
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:19,597
- Take the cane.

898
01:04:20,265 --> 01:04:22,142
- Say something?

899
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:54,176
Hope you enjoyed belittling me.
What are you doing?

900
01:04:54,676 --> 01:04:55,803
I'm leaving.

901
01:04:56,845 --> 01:04:59,014
Any problems I missed?

902
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:02,268
There is a problem that you have ignored:

903
01:05:03,227 --> 01:05:04,437
I do not belong, Peter.

904
01:05:04,645 --> 01:05:05,938
We discuss this tomorrow.

905
01:05:06,105 --> 01:05:09,901
Peter, I'm leaving and not coming back.

906
01:05:10,401 --> 01:05:11,611
And where are you?

907
01:05:12,028 --> 01:05:13,488
I'll see Tommy.

908
01:05:14,155 --> 01:05:15,448
Tommy?

909
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:17,284
Tommy Ballenger.

910
01:05:18,618 --> 01:05:19,661
The Huh?

911
01:05:20,287 --> 01:05:23,957
Whether you spend your life with
doing he protests,

912
01:05:24,166 --> 01:05:28,421
throwing condoms in churches
and denouncing the injustices of the world?

913
01:05:28,587 --> 01:05:31,257
Why think you saved it?

914
01:05:31,424 --> 01:05:32,758
And as I saved?

915
01:05:32,967 --> 01:05:35,386
If I had not pressed Larry
to publish your book

916
01:05:35,845 --> 01:05:38,139
this was the life that would be
leading up to now.

917
01:05:38,348 --> 01:05:40,892
- You said to publish the book?
- Of course I did!

918
01:05:41,101 --> 01:05:43,061
- Stupid shit!

919
01:05:43,353 --> 01:05:46,899
You had the opportunity to succeed.
And what did?

920
01:05:47,065 --> 01:05:49,777
Played out. Ruined her life

921
01:05:49,943 --> 01:05:51,028
That book Destroy my life!

922
01:05:52,238 --> 01:05:53,948
What made you this monster! "

923
01:05:54,156 --> 01:05:56,450
I have not changed, you did.

924
01:05:56,909 --> 01:06:00,329
Now put those bags and go back up.

925
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:21,852
Where's the remote?

926
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:23,312
Me.

927
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,022
Could open up for me?

928
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,318
Alan, it's cold out here.
Let's go?

929
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:32,030
then go to a place warmer than
Hell, I got a plane to catch.

930
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:43,292
Peter, the last time, open the gate!

931
01:06:46,879 --> 01:06:48,631
The party moved here?

932
01:06:49,090 --> 01:06:51,175
Could you sense your child?

933
01:06:58,767 --> 01:07:02,270
Hi son, I guess
what you call common sense.

934
01:07:02,521 --> 01:07:04,022
Mother, I must leave.

935
01:07:04,398 --> 01:07:05,816
It makes sense for me.

936
01:07:06,483 --> 01:07:09,028
Take care and tell Tommy she loves him.

937
01:07:09,361 --> 01:07:12,114
- What are all doing out here?
- It's okay, Dad.

938
01:07:12,323 --> 01:07:14,200
Could open the gate?

939
01:07:14,408 --> 01:07:16,410
You're not helping the situation.

940
01:07:16,577 --> 01:07:17,411
Where to go?

941
01:07:17,703 --> 01:07:19,580
He is leaving this hell is here!

942
01:07:19,789 --> 01:07:21,082
Because everybody scream here?

943
01:07:21,624 --> 01:07:23,126
Could open the gate?

944
01:07:23,334 --> 01:07:24,586
It's time to go home.

945
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,881
What are you doing?

946
01:07:28,089 --> 01:07:28,965
Let him go!

947
01:07:29,132 --> 01:07:30,200
No Me.

948
01:07:31,093 --> 01:07:32,094
That's was my grandmother!

949
01:07:32,302 --> 01:07:33,887
She herself did, I suppose!

950
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,017
Give me that remote!

951
01:07:38,434 --> 01:07:39,727
Oh no, not this.

952
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:43,606
Shit, get out!

953
01:07:43,814 --> 01:07:45,316
Enough!

954
01:07:47,151 --> 01:07:48,361
Behave yourselves!

955
01:07:50,405 --> 01:07:51,865
No!

956
01:09:02,356 --> 01:09:05,193
Your guide to the great state of Texas has arrived.

957
01:09:06,235 --> 01:09:07,654
I never thought I could do it.

958
01:09:09,739 --> 01:09:12,033
I need to brown. I thought... Why not?

959
01:09:15,704 --> 01:09:17,122
It's the old car?

960
01:09:18,165 --> 01:09:19,041
Yes.

961
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:20,751
And it works?

962
01:09:21,251 --> 01:09:24,296
Gives problems, but takes you wherever.

963
01:09:28,467 --> 01:09:30,970
We better go.

964
01:10:07,134 --> 01:10:08,427
What is this?

965
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,431
Is the plant you gave me
at our first meeting.

966
01:10:13,515 --> 01:10:16,685
Are you kidding?
It's so great!

967
01:10:19,063 --> 01:10:20,940
I talk to her twice a day.

968
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:26,362
I can not believe that kept her alive!

969
01:10:31,785 --> 01:10:33,286
How have you been?

970
01:10:34,454 --> 01:10:37,249
Good Things could not
be better. I. ..

971
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:39,752
Airport?

972
01:10:40,919 --> 01:10:43,005
Texas Prime Air, please.

973
01:10:46,759 --> 01:10:48,386
What say?

974
01:11:09,450 --> 01:11:11,702
You are practical and that?
Are you sure?

975
01:11:18,584 --> 01:11:22,464
Here are the passports, we have passages
back to 1 hour to San Antonio.

976
01:11:22,881 --> 01:11:24,132
What's wrong with him?

977
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:27,511
Had a bad day. Thank you.

978
01:11:27,803 --> 01:11:30,305
It seems more serious than that.

979
01:11:31,431 --> 01:11:33,684
Ok, a bad and long day. We embark.

980
01:11:34,852 --> 01:11:36,312
Our boarding passes.

981
01:11:36,562 --> 01:11:39,148
Our names are Tommy
Ballenger and Alan Oakley.

982
01:11:40,691 --> 01:11:43,361
I'm sorry sir, but I can
let him board with it

983
01:11:43,528 --> 01:11:44,862
I can not leave it behind!

984
01:11:45,029 --> 01:11:47,866
It is regulation of the company.
Your friend is obviously ill...

985
01:11:48,032 --> 01:11:51,620
and can not risk infecting
other passengers is not safe

986
01:11:51,870 --> 01:11:53,246
We're not planning to fly the plane,

987
01:11:53,455 --> 01:11:54,915
just want to sit quietly.

988
01:11:55,082 --> 01:11:59,178
Could call their supervisor
or some humans, if there is any?

989
01:11:59,245 --> 01:12:00,295
My supervisor...

990
01:12:00,504 --> 01:12:04,133
... Tell him the same.
Now I have other passengers. Next!

991
01:12:04,425 --> 01:12:05,801
Call your supervisor,

992
01:12:06,969 --> 01:12:07,970
Now!

993
01:12:08,262 --> 01:12:09,764
Do not talk to me like this.

994
01:12:09,931 --> 01:12:13,476
and stay behind the line.
Next please! "

995
01:12:14,269 --> 01:12:17,522
- Come on. She knows what she does.
- Not me

996
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,692
Listen to your aeromoçca stupid

997
01:12:20,901 --> 01:12:22,527
Bring your supervisor now

998
01:12:22,736 --> 01:12:26,323
or you will fly at 30,000 feet
when I shove it up your ass!

999
01:12:28,534 --> 01:12:30,453
Whew... There is a little nervous?

1000
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,581
Whew... you are not a little bitch?

1001
01:12:35,249 --> 01:12:37,919
Here is Louise,
the counter of the Texas Premiere.

1002
01:12:38,086 --> 01:12:42,841
I have a very aggressive passenger
and need help fast.

1003
01:12:43,091 --> 01:12:44,843
Finally we are progressing.

1004
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:47,095
I do not think call security
is a step forward.

1005
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:50,974
What? Fucking bitch!
Puta Texas Premiere!

1006
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:53,978
Let me get my plan.

1007
01:12:54,478 --> 01:12:57,606
Cow! Put a little more
shadow the next time.

1008
01:13:01,152 --> 01:13:03,446
The security guards were saved
than podeia have done.

1009
01:13:08,910 --> 01:13:11,246
You have developed a beautiful vocabulary.

1010
01:13:12,122 --> 01:13:13,874
You are writing children's books?

1011
01:13:14,124 --> 01:13:16,877
Yes, a bit like writing "cow."

1012
01:13:17,836 --> 01:13:19,630
The correct word is "bitch"!

1013
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:25,678
Tell me how we get in Texas?

1014
01:13:26,679 --> 01:13:29,599
We will do as you always wanted.

1015
01:13:38,233 --> 01:13:40,402
Want to see the map?

1016
01:13:40,569 --> 01:13:41,695
Yes.

1017
01:13:47,076 --> 01:13:49,537
- What are you doing with a gun?
- It's not loaded.

1018
01:13:49,703 --> 01:13:51,622
You can get rid of it?

1019
01:13:51,872 --> 01:13:54,458
I want a jockey?
That a child jockey in the shoulder ache?

1020
01:13:54,625 --> 01:13:56,377
You know I hate guns.

1021
01:13:56,669 --> 01:13:58,838
Nobody travels through Mexico without protection.

1022
01:13:59,005 --> 01:14:02,133
Then store in the glove compartment,
do not want to see it again!

1023
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,264
Ok See?
Thank you.

1024
01:14:11,602 --> 01:14:13,646
Can not read this.

1025
01:14:13,854 --> 01:14:15,648
There is nothing to see. Come to the North.

1026
01:14:45,513 --> 01:14:47,598
Peter was very good to me
after you're gone.

1027
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:51,269
I stayed at a friend's house a year...

1028
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:53,563
I welcomed the first year
and then things were happening.

1029
01:14:55,138 --> 01:14:59,312
In the last two years have not been...

1030
01:15:01,471 --> 01:15:02,745
this was the point...

1031
01:15:14,912 --> 01:15:16,562
One room, one night, please.

1032
01:15:17,463 --> 01:15:19,090
$ 25.

1033
01:15:21,051 --> 01:15:22,385
Give it.

1034
01:15:22,552 --> 01:15:23,470
Sorry,

1035
01:15:24,471 --> 01:15:26,014
We do not accept credit cards.

1036
01:15:26,807 --> 01:15:29,268
Do not accept in these parts.

1037
01:15:29,935 --> 01:15:32,354
He said that anyone around here
credit card accepted.

1038
01:15:32,521 --> 01:15:34,481
All we have are 20 dollars in pesos.

1039
01:15:34,648 --> 01:15:36,692
I have nothing in cash,
I thought we were going by plane.

1040
01:15:36,859 --> 01:15:40,738
Ask if $ 20 is good.

1041
01:15:43,533 --> 01:15:45,743
It is a difference of $ 5!

1042
01:15:48,288 --> 01:15:49,664
Okay, go, go!

1043
01:15:58,340 --> 01:15:59,800
That damn...!

1044
01:16:07,975 --> 01:16:10,520
What, what?

1045
01:16:31,172 --> 01:16:32,402
Be right back.

1046
01:16:46,391 --> 01:16:47,517
Carrier?

1047
01:16:47,768 --> 01:16:51,355
I can connect with the United States?
- I do not understand

1048
01:16:52,648 --> 01:16:56,444
States, America, California?

1049
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:59,530
Do you speak English? Can pass to someone
who speaks English? CA.

1050
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,202
- I do not speak English.
Shit!

1051
01:17:11,918 --> 01:17:13,795
Look who finally woke up!

1052
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:21,762
We have almost no fuel,
have no money for food.

1053
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:26,601
I can not do any good, right?

1054
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:29,437
What are you talking about?

1055
01:17:29,896 --> 01:17:32,524
It's the sweetest guy I met and intelligent

1056
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:34,734
Why do you think you got
all those years?

1057
01:17:34,901 --> 01:17:38,029
Yes, until he published that book.

1058
01:17:38,238 --> 01:17:39,990
I read it to assess

1059
01:17:41,074 --> 01:17:44,787
and although the subject was well written.

1060
01:17:45,746 --> 01:17:47,623
- Do you read?
- Yes

1061
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:52,378
I tried to cancel but it was Peter
published it behind my back.

1062
01:17:56,215 --> 01:17:58,593
All this time I
I never stopped loving you.

1063
01:18:03,765 --> 01:18:06,268
Thank you. I'm really happy about that.

1064
01:18:15,611 --> 01:18:19,657
Do not know much how to write,
but I know one thing.

1065
01:18:20,992 --> 01:18:23,995
have to write with your heart
and not with your head

1066
01:18:25,663 --> 01:18:28,542
while reading the book I read:

1067
01:18:28,959 --> 01:18:31,837
"This is not Alan," Alan did not talk like that "

1068
01:18:37,217 --> 01:18:39,386
I'll take you to the doctor tomorrow.

1069
01:18:47,228 --> 01:18:48,688
Do not talk.

1070
01:18:50,315 --> 01:18:52,317
Sorry for making you go through this.

1071
01:18:52,525 --> 01:18:54,819
I'm happy to be with you again.

1072
01:19:00,367 --> 01:19:01,952
Gotta get some sleep.

1073
01:19:02,661 --> 01:19:03,871
I'm really tired.

1074
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:47,167
Hey. What are you doing?

1075
01:19:47,542 --> 01:19:48,627
These bags are ours!

1076
01:19:55,634 --> 01:19:58,053
Do not think. Has a gun
behind the pants. Take it.

1077
01:19:58,262 --> 01:19:59,305
I will not do that.

1078
01:19:59,555 --> 01:20:00,890
Go!

1079
01:20:01,098 --> 01:20:03,017
No, I hate guns, I will not
grab it and not the gun.

1080
01:20:04,435 --> 01:20:06,938
Ok, you come here. He points to this,

1081
01:20:07,105 --> 01:20:08,356
and I caught his.

1082
01:20:08,565 --> 01:20:09,899
I will not hold a gun

1083
01:20:10,108 --> 01:20:12,444
So why do not
The brings us to Texas.

1084
01:20:12,652 --> 01:20:14,529
Okay, I'll do!

1085
01:20:15,113 --> 01:20:17,074
You are so peremptory!

1086
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,283
- What was that?

1087
01:20:21,995 --> 01:20:23,163
Sorry.

1088
01:20:24,164 --> 01:20:25,416
Sorry, I have to get...

1089
01:20:31,047 --> 01:20:32,382
Lie down!

1090
01:20:33,216 --> 01:20:35,051
- Not you, him!
- Sorry.

1091
01:20:36,427 --> 01:20:37,971
Lie on the floor and kiss the dust!

1092
01:20:38,722 --> 01:20:39,889
He or I?

1093
01:20:40,056 --> 01:20:41,141
Oh Christ! I'm talking to him.

1094
01:20:41,308 --> 01:20:45,479
Because he speaks English. He does not know English.
I guess not!

1095
01:20:45,676 --> 01:20:47,773
I liked when they talked so much.

1096
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:50,484
And what you expect when someone
a gun like a madman?

1097
01:20:51,735 --> 01:20:52,611
Shut up!

1098
01:20:53,404 --> 01:20:55,990
Could have circumvented the situation
without pointing a gun.

1099
01:20:56,025 --> 01:20:57,976
Pro floor, now!

1100
01:21:00,286 --> 01:21:02,038
Grab our bags.

1101
01:21:12,674 --> 01:21:15,511
Fill the tank!

1102
01:21:15,678 --> 01:21:17,346
- Yes you!
- Still very smart!

1103
01:21:18,222 --> 01:21:19,640
So you like me.

1104
01:21:20,433 --> 01:21:21,684
Shit!

1105
01:21:29,108 --> 01:21:31,945
Sorry.
Let's send a check for gas

1106
01:21:32,445 --> 01:21:33,738
What are you talking about?

1107
01:21:33,947 --> 01:21:35,157
I feel bad doing it.

1108
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:36,825
Why. He was stealing from us!

1109
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:38,869
Maybe he needed money.

1110
01:21:39,578 --> 01:21:41,872
You became a liberal.

1111
01:21:43,457 --> 01:21:45,376
Come and grab the money box.

1112
01:21:45,793 --> 01:21:46,794
That will bring us problems...

1113
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:49,005
We need money.

1114
01:21:49,630 --> 01:21:52,633
You can send him a check and a
Balloons as excuses later.

1115
01:21:52,842 --> 01:21:54,802
I will not steal!

1116
01:21:56,429 --> 01:21:58,306
Ok if you are not moving,
I'll shoot you

1117
01:21:59,891 --> 01:22:01,685
- What?

1118
01:22:02,185 --> 01:22:04,146
Now I who is
with stealing a gun!

1119
01:22:04,479 --> 01:22:05,814
You're crazy!

1120
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:21,130
Here you are.

1121
01:22:34,595 --> 01:22:35,888
Hold on a second...

1122
01:22:36,764 --> 01:22:37,723
What are you doing?

1123
01:22:40,601 --> 01:22:42,478
I thought you said
I was discharged!

1124
01:22:42,770 --> 01:22:44,063
Now.

1125
01:23:05,878 --> 01:23:07,254
Why is it stopping?

1126
01:23:12,802 --> 01:23:14,179
Give me the gun.

1127
01:23:15,638 --> 01:23:17,557
Give me the gun!

1128
01:23:17,724 --> 01:23:19,643
What's wrong? It was fun.

1129
01:23:21,478 --> 01:23:23,730
Never do that again!

1130
01:23:24,147 --> 01:23:25,399
I saved your life!

1131
01:23:25,566 --> 01:23:27,484
I can not keep doing this shit ok?

1132
01:23:27,651 --> 01:23:30,613
Okay, why not turn and
apologized to the guy.

1133
01:23:30,863 --> 01:23:34,617
I should not have come here.

1134
01:23:48,674 --> 01:23:51,426
Sorry, did not mean it.

1135
01:23:53,178 --> 01:23:56,473
Only I do not have much practice
in robbing gas stations.

1136
01:24:01,729 --> 01:24:04,148
Thank you for saving my ass.

1137
01:24:06,442 --> 01:24:09,279
For that ass? How much you want?

1138
01:24:13,575 --> 01:24:15,410
Let me see where we are.

1139
01:24:29,509 --> 01:24:31,678
We are less than one days of the border.

1140
01:24:31,844 --> 01:24:33,471
We will be there in the morning.

1141
01:24:41,229 --> 01:24:45,526
I really feel for what you said,
did not mean any of it.

1142
01:24:47,486 --> 01:24:49,113
I can compensate.

1143
01:24:50,573 --> 01:24:51,782
How?

1144
01:24:53,576 --> 01:24:56,245
Do you remember the time he was
depressed because I had lost my job,

1145
01:24:56,412 --> 01:24:57,830
and what he said to comfort me?

1146
01:25:01,835 --> 01:25:03,962
- No
- Come on. Summer 75...

1147
01:25:07,591 --> 01:25:09,551
Yes, I remember.

1148
01:25:10,677 --> 01:25:13,430
- No, no way!
- Come on, please.

1149
01:25:14,181 --> 01:25:16,016
- No!
- S meant a lot to me.

1150
01:25:16,725 --> 01:25:19,353
- Here?
- We have not seen any car for hours.

1151
01:25:21,230 --> 01:25:22,857
- It can not be serious!

1152
01:26:51,117 --> 01:26:52,744
Never again will I hear you!

1153
01:26:53,578 --> 01:26:54,830
It made me feel better.

1154
01:26:57,666 --> 01:26:59,460
I'm so happy for you.

1155
01:27:01,712 --> 01:27:03,214
Dipshit!

1156
01:27:07,718 --> 01:27:08,803
Oh, shit!

1157
01:27:11,667 --> 01:27:12,511
Hand up high!

1158
01:27:16,519 --> 01:27:18,730
Hands up! out of the car slowly.

1159
01:27:18,939 --> 01:27:20,273
Tommy, get out of the car.

1160
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,692
We did not do anything!

1161
01:27:21,858 --> 01:27:23,569
Shut up and put your hands on the hood!

1162
01:27:28,073 --> 01:27:29,116
Where's the gun?

1163
01:27:29,325 --> 01:27:31,452
- We have no weapon.
- Do not lie!

1164
01:27:32,328 --> 01:27:34,497
When you stole the post from my brother
had a gun.

1165
01:27:34,664 --> 01:27:35,873
Throw away.

1166
01:27:37,250 --> 01:27:38,293
What makes you think you can come to my parents

1167
01:27:38,501 --> 01:27:39,794
and rob us?

1168
01:27:40,128 --> 01:27:41,588
He was stealing from us!

1169
01:27:41,755 --> 01:27:42,764
Out!

1170
01:27:46,051 --> 01:27:47,052
I do not like liars!

1171
01:27:47,219 --> 01:27:48,470
- Leave him alone!
- Shut up!

1172
01:27:48,679 --> 01:27:50,639
He needs to go to the doctor in Texas.

1173
01:27:52,766 --> 01:27:54,935
You will need a doctor
when finished with it.

1174
01:28:03,277 --> 01:28:05,154
It appears that your friend left you?
Do not worry, do not go far

1175
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:13,786
This is what they did
my brother's car.

1176
01:28:17,365 --> 01:28:18,559
and this is for making me come here.

1177
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:21,320
Hey!

1178
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:25,509
Picked the wrong day to mess with me!

1179
01:29:30,704 --> 01:29:32,831
I died and gone to gay heaven.

1180
01:29:35,584 --> 01:29:37,711
I want a little "disco lights"

1181
01:30:03,572 --> 01:30:06,116
Awake sleeper, we are almost there.

1182
01:30:11,247 --> 01:30:13,124
No, not when I'm driving.

1183
01:30:14,917 --> 01:30:17,295
We will arrive in less than an hour.

1184
01:30:24,594 --> 01:30:25,762
Tommy?

1185
01:30:27,306 --> 01:30:31,364
No fun. Tommy.

1186
01:30:34,605 --> 01:30:35,856
Come on!
Please wake up.

1187
01:30:44,157 --> 01:30:46,826
Can not die when you bring back.

1188
01:30:46,861 --> 01:30:49,330
Come on, please!

1189
01:30:52,749 --> 01:30:56,628
Never had the opportunity to
tell you how much I love you!

1190
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:09,623
2 years later

1191
01:32:13,001 --> 01:32:14,253
Thank you.

1192
01:32:18,757 --> 01:32:20,760
This is the best love story I read!

1193
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:21,928
Thanks!

1194
01:32:23,346 --> 01:32:25,515
Made me take more easily.

1195
01:32:25,890 --> 01:32:27,934
It means a lot to me, thanks.

1196
01:32:31,678 --> 01:32:33,892
Tommy
