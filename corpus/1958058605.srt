773
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,530
NOW YOU SEE?

774
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:55,199
WE DO HAVE SOMETHING IN COMMON.

775
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:56,033
THAT CAR IS WANTED

776
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:56,834

777
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,603
THE KINGSLEY ROBBERY.

778
00:43:58,603 --> 00:43:59,570
YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?

779
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,939
NO.

780
00:44:01,939 --> 00:44:02,373
THEN WHY THE INTEREST

781
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:03,841

782
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:04,775

00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,320
WE SHOULD TAKE A TRIP

790
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,658
DOWNTOWN AND TALK ABOUT THIS.

791
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,994
BULLSHIT!

822
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:01,525
THE CAR WAS STOLEN

823
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:02,293

DO YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE

850
00:46:41,032 --> 00:46:41,699
