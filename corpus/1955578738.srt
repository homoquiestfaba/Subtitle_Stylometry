1
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,046
Shit!

2
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,880
Shit!

3
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,404
We were invited to Henry
Grotsky's son's wedding.

4
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,324
We got invited to Henry
Grotsky's son's wedding?

5
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,243
Yeah. Why are you
saying it like that?

6
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,651
Why am I saying it
the way someone

7
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,216
who was just invited
to the wedding...

8
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,244
of the child of a guy
he barely knows would say it?

9
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,249
We're going.
Mmm-mmm.

10
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,376
This place will be fine
without us for a weekend.

11
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,084
No. Not going.

12
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,322
Jerry, you're
the president of idiots.

13
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,522
Bina, you're the dummy
who voted me into office.

14
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,967
Okay, impeached.
Too late. I resign.

15
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,610
Ha-ha!

16
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,005
I was first.

17
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,609
This could be a great
thing for you, sweetie.

18
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,524
Look, it was
at a friend's wedding

19
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,682
that your dad and I
first got it on.

20
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,800
Open the door,
I want to show you something.

21
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,889
I'm flat-out naked
in here, so...

22
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,804
Renzo Eckberg, your manhood
is nothing to be ashamed of.

23
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,406
Your manhood is a glory to God.

24
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,482
Open the door a crack,
I'll fling it in.

25
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,161
This could be how you meet
the love of your life.

26
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,409
Girls are always so drunk
and emotional at weddings.

27
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,960
Maybe that's where
you'll really shine.

28
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,243
Should I start hanging out
at wakes too?

29
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,130
Oh, let's see
how the wedding goes first.

30
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,646
You got a letter from someone.

31
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,560
I'm pretty surprised about it.

32
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,600
I didn't know you knew
anyone in the free world.

33
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,044
Good boy!

34
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,448
Why, thank you, Ringo.

35
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,566
Oh, my!

36
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,845
Oh, Ringo!

37
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,491
<i>I, Francie.</i> ..

38
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,325
<i>Take you, Douglas, as you</i> are...

39
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,647
<i>To love and to cherish...</i>

40
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,882
<i>to have and to hold...</i>

41
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,769
<i>Until death do us part.</i>

42
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,523
<i>Frances Millner,
Douglas Grotsky, take hands.</i>

43
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,087
<i>You may now kiss
as husband and wife.</i>

44
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,447
Two miles later,
we're almost there.

45
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,366
Hi.

46
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,926
Oh, my God.

47
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,801
Shit.

48
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,480
You look good, ladies.
Right here.

49
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,561
I'll see you in there.

50
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,441
Hi.
Hey.

51
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,847
You're here.
That's c...

52
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,721
Mmm-hmm.

53
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,491
Why are you here?

54
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,601
Same as you.

55
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,844
Because I'm the best man
at my sister's wedding.

56
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,160
Okay-

57
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,490
So it's not the same at all.

58
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,088
Oh, my God, just...

59
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,640
<i>Give a
little bit of love to grow</i>

60
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,761
Have fun!

61
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Oh, shit.

62
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,168
<i>Don't you make me beg for more</i>

63
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,685
<i>Give a sign, I need to know</i>

64
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,976
<i>I wish I could be there
to be your wingman, honey.</i>

65
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,650
<i>Whether you get a girl to smile</i>

66
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,096
<i>or whether she runs away,
it's all good.</i>

67
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,531
Gotta go, someone's here.

68
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,326
Hello.

69
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,850
I'm Francie Millner's
first nanny,

70
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,086
Jo Flanagan.

71
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,528
That's Jo with a "J"
and an "O" and no

72
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,684
I'm Renzo. With an "E"
and an "O" and no

73
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,681
You have an intense look
about you, Renzo.

74
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,571
Thank you.
I'm working on that.

75
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,007
Hi.

76
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,206
Bina and Jerry Kepp, hello.

77
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,204
Oh, Jesus Christ.

78
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,561
Walter.

79
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,170
Hello, Roger.
Nice to see you.

80
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,560
Thank you so much
for inviting me,

81
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,647
it really means a lot.

82
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,848
Thank you so much.
I didn't invite you.

83
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,201
Francie did.

84
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,086
Okay.
I honestly thought

85
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,049
they wouldn't let you
travel out of state.

86
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,565
Well, you know.

87
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,884
Hello! Thank you
for inviting me.

88
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,405
Thank you so much for coming.

89
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,209
I don't think we've ever been

90
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,851
at a reception table
with a nanny before.

91
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,126
Have we, Jerry?

92
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,645
Only very good

93
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,484
or very bad nannies

94
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,131
are remembered
so many years later.

95
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,290
Which one are you?

96
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,721
You guys swingers?

97
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,366
No, you're not. Right? No.

98
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,280
<i>Renzo, pick up
the phone-Renzo, pick up the phone.</i>

99
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,769
Did you not request
a singles' table?

100
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,604
Because so far,
it's slim pickings.

101
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,001
<i>It was on the RSVP.
You put it there yourself.</i>

102
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,161
Pardon me.

103
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,736
<i>And how are you so sure
you're not with the singles?</i>

104
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,171
<i>If there are couples
at your table,</i>

105
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,129
<i>they could be
what's called "swingers."</i>

106
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,091
How well do you know the
bride and groom, Mr. Kepp?

107
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,800
Hmm. I can smell
the toilets from here,

108
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,560
that's how well we know
the bride and groom.

109
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,122
Don't listen to him,
he's not a romantic.

110
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,611
This is a great table.

111
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,761
It's a great one.

112
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,769
Mmm. No, it isn't.
Yeah, it is.

113
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,241
Yes, it is.
No, it isn't.

114
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,606
Yes, it is.
No, it isn't.

115
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,886
Well, we'll see.
Okay.

116
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,121
Hello. Sorry.

117
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,208
Someone's sitting in that.
Sorry.

118
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,442
Sorry. I'm sorry.

119
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,646
Is this one okay?

120
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,721
Yeah. No one's...

121
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,885
My name is Walter.

122
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,851
I can tell by your accent

123
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,163
you must be a relation
to the bride's father.

124
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,965
Close relation?

125
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,561
Yes.

126
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,687
Oh.

127
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,281
Hmm.

128
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,722
So what do you do, Walter?

129
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,928
What do I do...

130
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,526
For work?

131
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,616
- Leave it alone.
- Why can't a person ask that?

132
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,721
Yeah, I'd like to know.

133
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,040
Okay, then. Okay.

134
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,326
She'd like to know.

135
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,484
So, Walter,
what is it that you do?

136
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,091
I am a successful businessman.

137
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,521
Oh.
Okay.

138
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,810
- Okay, then.
- Hmm.

139
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,240
Mmm-hmm.

140
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,209
What kind of business?

141
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,409
Sorry, do you mind?

142
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,656
<i>So, forget the married people.</i>

143
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,727
<i>Dance with the nanny.</i>

144
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,326
<i>Hollywood marriages bust up all
the time because of the nanny.</i>

145
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,606
<i>And you know what, Renzo?</i>

146
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,921
<i>Even if she is a little older,
so what?</i>

147
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,576
<i>There's something to be said
for know-how,</i>

148
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,251
<i>experience and someone
who's seen a lot of things.</i>

149
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,846
<i>You don't want somebody
perfect for your first dance.</i>

150
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,285
<i>It's just too intimidating.</i>

151
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,810
You okay?

152
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,171
No. Not okay.

153
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,536
I could just see you staring
at somebody for a minute.

154
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,325
Like a real, true minute which
is a long time to stare.

155
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,016
Tells me you got something
brewing up here.

156
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,405
Sorry, do I know you?

157
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,896
Do you mind
if I say something else?

158
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,365
I'm gonna say something else.

159
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,283
Nobody deserves a full
minute of your attention

160
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,800
unless they're giving it
back to you.

161
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,765
Oh.
Smile!

162
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,969
Hey, just something
for you to think about.

163
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Me to you.

164
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,851
You're welcome.

165
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,363
Um, what the fu...

166
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,050
- Hey!
- Sorry?

167
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,009
Don't do that.
Do what?

168
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,969
Just say something smug
and walk away.

169
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,565
No, it wasn't like that.

170
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,496
I just saw you there, and I...
Yeah, well, it was like that.

171
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,090
Also, in order
for you to know that

172
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,323
I'd been staring at someone
for a real, true minute,

173
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,370
you had to be staring at me
for a real, true minute.

174
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,488
Also, that was a test.
Which I passed.

175
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,251
My ex-boyfriend
is in there.

176
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,089
And I...
You know, felt nothing.

177
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,969
I felt nothing at all.

178
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,361
Right.
So, I misread that entirely.

179
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,841
Yeah. I guess you did.

180
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,964
Sorry, I'm...
I'm having an off day.

181
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,205
Do you ever have that?

182
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,203
Kind of day where
you think that the things

183
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,001
that come so easy to
everyone else just seem so

184
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,850
elusive?

185
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,401
No.

186
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,169
Yeah, me neither.

187
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,325
Okay-
Okay-

188
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,045
Not that you asked, but
this is where I'm sitting

189
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,448
so if you end up
in the high teens,

190
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,329
you know where to find me.

191
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,326
Shit!

192
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,401
Oh, shit.

193
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,808
<i>Are you feeling all right?</i>

194
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,256
What do you say your name is?

195
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,441
Megan-Ann.

196
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,090
Megan-Ann. Okay.
I will not forget.

197
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,607
I should have married Leroy
while I had the chance.

198
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,365
Leroy knew where
to put his hands.

199
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,170
Ah, you're the killer, Nyung.
Don't deny it, you shit.

200
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,085
It's hard to put down
a good book.

201
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,443
Yes.

202
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,884
Who doesn't love to read books?
I do, as a normal person.

203
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,008
What's your favorite book,
Walter?

204
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,405
Probably that one.

205
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,610
Walter, where do you live?

206
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,524
Today will not suck.

207
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,528
Your nails are orange
and your hair is orange.

208
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,163
And your dress is orange.
I say it's too much orange.

209
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,050
Too much orange?

210
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,006
That's what I was saying, so
you have to lose one of them.

211
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,206
I meant the dress.

212
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,645
On, my God.

213
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,281
Where are you from?

214
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,765
Hi.
Hellomygod.

215
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,889
- Okay. Hi.
- Hi!

216
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
I am Renzo.

217
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,048
I've achieved puberty
and I'm in a rock band.

218
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,284
I'm Walter, I'm a successful businessman
and I've also reached puberty.

219
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,685
Well, terrific.
I'm Eloise.

220
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,047
So far, it's my mom on bass
and me on lyrics,

221
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,282
but it's pretty cool.
Very cool.

222
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,321
Uh-huh.

223
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,926
There's No Bad Name
For a High School Rock Band.

224
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,009
Is what we're calling ourselves.

225
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,286
I'm calling it "The Band."

226
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,361
Eloise, what's your connection
to the bride and groom?

227
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,043
Right, yeah, that's the sort
of question you ask back here.

228
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,456
It's not gonna be
what you want to hear.

229
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,840
It won't be
what she wants to hear.

230
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,965
You're Jo Flanagan, right?

231
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,565
You're the nanny.
Francie's nanny.

232
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,766
How do you know that?

233
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,411
And you know Henry Grotsky
from the diner scene,

234
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,720
you're those people...

235
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,251
<i>Jesus, not the Humps.</i>

236
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,367
Wow.

237
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,521
The Kepps.

238
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,125
- Bina and Jerry Kepp.
- Right.

239
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,656
And I'm Walter,
just a successful businessman

240
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,523
who just likes to read
his favorite book.

241
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,721
<i>That one.</i>

242
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,369
And you're
Grotsky's friend's kid?

243
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,726
You requested
the singles' table.

244
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,290
That was never gonna happen.

245
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,566
How do you know us?

246
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,246
So, Francie, today's bride,
is my oldest friend.

247
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,481
Oh... Thank you!

248
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,489
There's been a long discussion

249
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,841
about what kind of table this is

250
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,241
and you've just resolved it!

251
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,091
She is the best friend
of the bride.

252
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,207
Well, oldest.

253
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,443
How close to the toilet
do you feel now, Mr. Kepp?

254
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,520
The same.
The distance is the same.

255
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,040
You know what?
It's the same wedding.

256
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,367
It's the same celebration no
matter what table you're at.

257
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,285
I'm a fan of
detective fiction, Eloise.

258
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,124
Big, big fan.

259
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,323
So when I find that something
doesn't add up, I investigate.

260
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,607
Can't help being a detective,
it's just who I am.

261
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,207
And you want to know what rank on
the force my husband has attained?

262
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,127
He manages a diner in Columbus, Ohio.
That rank.

263
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,731
Fill us in anyway, would you,

264
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,007
on how exactly
the bride's best friend

265
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,526
ended up back here
with the Klumps.

266
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,244
Oldest friend.
Leave it alone.

267
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,561
No, that's fine.
It's not, it's...

268
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,688
It's no mystery,
it's not a big deal.

269
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,490
I got dumped
by Francie's brother,

270
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,961
Teddy Millner, the best man.

271
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,800
That tall drink of shit
over there at table one

272
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,803
you can barely see.
God, look at him.

273
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,083
That guy is exactly
who you think he'd be.

274
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,481
Yeah, just a selfish jerk.

275
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,403
Which I somehow didn't see
until two months ago

276
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,562
when he dumped me out of the blue.
Then I saw.

277
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,526
So I dropped out
as maid of honor

278
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,602
because it was awkward
and I RSVP'd "No."

279
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,456
Well, "Yes" and then "No."
And then I thought,

280
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,244
this is about Francie,
it's her day,

281
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,176
and I won't let her brother
scare me away from that.

282
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,964
I'm glad I came.
I'm fine.

283
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,522
I feel nothing, actually.
I'm, like...

284
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,762
I feel liberated.
I feel free.

285
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,686
God. You have no idea
what that feels like.

286
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,801
Someday.

287
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,684
I mean, lam free.
I do, I mean,

288
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,649
I'm a free man,
I do know how it feels.

289
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,845
Right. Great.

290
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,445
Well, then, you know.
It feels great.

291
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,727
I don't have to think
about him anymore.

292
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,805
Talk to him, or...

293
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,487
Excuse me.

294
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,407
<i>All right-Our
newlyweds will be joining us</i>

295
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,448
<i>for their first dance soon.</i>

296
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,646
Okay, what's going on, man?

297
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,086
<i>Meanwhile, enjoy the open bar.</i>

298
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,531
Come on, what does that mean?

299
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,761
What does that mean?

300
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,410
It means you leave me
a voicemail

301
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,205
telling me to tell Francie
not to open your RSVP card.

302
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,416
Then you leave me a voicemail
telling me that you're coming

303
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,489
and then another one saying
"Disregard the last one."

304
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,936
So that's what I mean,
what are you doing here?

305
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,400
You listened to
all those voicemails?

306
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,776
Hey, guys, right here.

307
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,284
Come on, El,
please don't go all crazy.

308
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,840
"All crazy"?
Now what does that mean?

309
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,445
It means you get mad.

310
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,841
You do something big
and you can't take it back

311
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,285
and it's too late, and then...

312
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,890
Crazy.
I do that?

313
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,451
I do that?

314
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,325
I'm not your mom,
so, I don't do that.

315
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,286
I think it's funny, mostly.

316
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,321
But not today.

317
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,608
Nikki will murder me...
All right, all right.

318
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,202
Nikki can calm down.
What is the deal with Nikki?

319
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
Really?

320
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,976
Wow. "What's the deal
with Nikki?" That's funny.

321
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,844
Why would you care about Nikki if
you're just here for my sister?

322
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,647
You're right.

323
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,960
Yeah.
You're right.

324
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,016
It's none of my business
if you cheated on me with her.

325
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,963
What?
Why should it even bother me?

326
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,083
Come on! I didn't
cheat on you with her.

327
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,930
It started after we broke up

328
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,490
and you dropped out
as maid of honor.

329
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,845
How does a guy who...

330
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,288
After two years, you break
up with me over text?

331
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,126
"Good luck with your
future endeavors"?

332
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,360
Were you firing me?

333
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,606
What the f...

334
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,761
You're an asshole.

335
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,450
Oh, my God,
you're such an asshole.

336
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,841
You're a ridiculous asshole.

337
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,369
Why don't you just go home?

338
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,409
Yeah?
Yeah.

339
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,922
Before you ruin
all this for Francie.

340
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,616
I don't have a ferry ticket
till tomorrow, anyway.

341
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,641
Swim.

342
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,246
Think she'll be back?

343
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,441
I vote yes.

344
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,886
Hey! Let's chat,

345
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,605
you and me.

346
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,290
No, I'd like my
elbow back, Nicole.

347
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,407
Fine.

348
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,641
Just don't make a scene.

349
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,041
Why does everyone
keep saying I do that?

350
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,565
Hey, Jerry Kepp.
Uh-huh.

351
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,846
Just a hypothetical.

352
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,002
If someone offered you
20 bucks to go up

353
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,481
to our room and read your
book in the tub, would you?

354
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,681
Say yes.

355
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,082
No. You know how I feel
about a hotel bathtub.

356
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,881
People do unconscionable
things in hotel bathtubs.

357
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,366
Okay, I'm sorry.

358
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,720
Bina, stand up. Bina, please,
stand up right now, please.

359
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,801
Why?

360
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,681
I will give you
20 unhypothetical dollars

361
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,171
if you stand up right now.

362
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,571
All right, then.

363
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,726
Okay?

364
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,361
What?

365
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,646
Honey.
Oh.

366
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,041
Shit.

367
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,571
What a shame.

368
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,250
Here you go.
Oh, thank you.

369
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,606
So much.

370
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,606
How long have you worked here?

371
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,721
Don't

372
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,643
really work here.

373
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,241
Yeah. What's up?

374
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,121
Look at that.

375
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,049
That is why I'm here today.

376
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,807
Rodriguez & Hayes
must be overjoyed.

377
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,407
Actually, I heard
they were fighting.

378
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,961
Okay, look.

379
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,930
Teddy broke up with you.

380
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,525
I know how hard
that can be, okay?

381
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,807
A long time ago,
he broke up with me

382
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,644
to go out with you, so I get it.

383
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,246
But you have to stop now.

384
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,561
I fit into this family.
You never did.

385
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,928
I was Francie's first choice
for maid of honor.

386
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,567
I was Teddy's first choice
for a girlfriend.

387
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,889
Sometimes, first sticks.
Sometimes, it doesn't.

388
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,325
He listened to every
voicemail I sent,

389
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,925
so what does that tell you?

390
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,690
Tells me you don't know
when to stop calling.

391
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,851
Hey, Bina.
Hmm?

392
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,928
Make use of the jacket
and grab us a cheese plate,

393
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,685
would you?

394
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,450
That's funny.
Last week,

395
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,488
I did a search history
on our computer.

396
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,246
And one of us looked up
"Topless Dame Helen Mirren."

397
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,246
Wasn't me.

398
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,722
M-I-R-R-E-N.

399
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,445
Why did you do that?

400
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,085
Why did you come here?

401
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,969
Jerry said he wasn't coming,

402
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,920
and then all of a sudden
he changed his mind

403
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,291
and he won't say why.

404
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,970
Since when does a man
need a reason

405
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,804
to go to a wedding
with his own wife?

406
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,882
See? He has
a pathological aversion

407
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,564
to answering
a question directly.

408
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,961
He always answers
with another question.

409
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,320
Why did you make
Facebook friends

410
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,930
with Henry Grotsky on Facebook?

411
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,765
You answered with a question.

412
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,649
Why are you looking
at my Facebook?

413
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,085
You just did the same thing.

414
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,162
Okay.
Actually, with Henry Grotsky

415
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,969
and Tom Fo.

416
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,401
Tom Fo?

417
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,886
Mmm-hmm.

418
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,802
Well, Henry Grotsky owns
five diners in Central Ohio.

419
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,924
We own a diner in Central Ohio.

420
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,447
Everyone who owns
a diner in Central Ohio

421
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,005
is Facebook friends.

422
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,082
You'd know that
if you paid attention.

423
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,730
Tom Fo. Okay.

424
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,004
Am I Facebook friends
with Tom Fo, really, Jerry?

425
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,003
Okay. All right.

426
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,244
Bina lost her virginity to a
loser immigrant named Tom Fo.

427
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,731
He was from Canada.

428
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,804
From the province of Canada that
produces the most insufferable people.

429
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,451
That's not true.
Manitoba. It is true.

430
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,526
Tom Fo is my first boyfriend,
and we loved each other.

431
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,411
Great, I'll friend
my first love now.

432
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,528
Helen Mirren will be thrilled.

433
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,527
<i>Renzo, pick up
the phone-Renzo, pick up.</i>

434
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,284
Not now, big fight.

435
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,646
Are you all right?
You look lost.

436
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,001
I do?

437
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,010
If you need help, just ask us.

438
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,724
Sorry, "If I need help"?

439
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,962
Do you?
Do you need my help?

440
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,925
Why would I need your help?

441
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,125
Well, you have no one.

442
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,129
I did the table assignments
with Francie.

443
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,249
How could the person who did the table
assignments have no one else here?

444
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,004
I planned half the wedding.

445
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,241
Okay-

446
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,404
Table one is Francie,
Doug and everyone

447
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,696
who actually matters
including Teddy Millner,

448
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,324
<i>the best man-child
and Nikki Carmichael,</i>

449
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,576
<i>the second-choice
maid of honor.</i>

450
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,656
Table two,
Francie's hideous dad...

451
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,736
Roger?
No, he's a lovely bloke.

452
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,216
<i>Roger and his trophy wife,
and Doug's parents</i>

453
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,296
<i>who are married but miserable.</i>

454
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,856
<i>Table three, Francie's
disaster of a mother,</i>

455
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,216
<i>her actual sorority sisters who
are all divorced, mostly twice,</i>

456
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,680
sometimes more.
What's happening now?

457
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,936
<i>Four, Doug's
kooky college friends.</i>

458
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,200
<i>Five, grandparents, no comment.</i>

459
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,616
<i>Six, Doug's dad's
military buddies.</i>

460
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,926
<i>Seven, decent cousins.</i>

461
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,336
Eight, indecent cousins
including Infamous Kate,

462
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,496
the Millner family nymphomaniac.

463
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
Where is eight now?

464
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,656
<i>Nine, Francie's
scintillating work.</i>

465
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,816
<i>10, Doug's even
more scintillating work.</i>

466
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,126
<i>11, kids' table, no comment.</i>

467
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,496
<i>12 and 13
are two tables of singles,</i>

468
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,096
<i>one supposedly cool,
the other supposedly not.</i>

469
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,616
<i>14, Doug's dad's
diner world connections.</i>

470
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,051
The hell are we doing back here?

471
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,336
<i>15 are the wedding hires
including the reverend,</i>

472
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,536
<i>the hairdresser,
the hairdresser's colorist.</i>

473
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,450
<i>And then there's three more
tables until you get back here.</i>

474
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,096
Do you know what Francie's
mother calls this table?

475
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,121
Enough.

476
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,496
What Carol Millner
calls Table 19?

477
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,376
The table that should have
known to RSVP regrets...

478
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,336
but not before sending
something nice off the registry.

479
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,361
Enough.

480
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,576
The table that could
disappear in the middle

481
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,776
of the wedding and no one
would even notice.

482
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,847
Enough!

483
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,016
I did the table assignments
with Francie

484
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,416
before I was replaced
as maid of honor

485
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,649
because her brother broke up with
me over text after two years.

486
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,324
That's the kind of
table this is.

487
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,361
I told Francie Millner a never-ending
story when she was five.

488
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,929
I taught her
a dozen rock-n-roll songs.

489
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,005
I gave her, her favorite
toy in the world.

490
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,801
A golden bird that she so loved,

491
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,002
I bet she still has it now.

492
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,766
Does that sound like a person
they would put at a table

493
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,366
of people they don't care about?

494
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,842
It sounds like someone who
was invited to a wedding

495
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,216
because Francie's
mother found out

496
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,641
she was paying $200 a plate
for the groom's nanny

497
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,768
and wanted to settle the score.

498
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,846
Oh, and me too.

499
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,524
I mean, I'm here too.

500
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,490
Even though Teddy Millner is
the worst person I ever knew.

501
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,605
I wanted to see if maybe
I was still in love with him.

502
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,816
So, thanks for the offer but I'm
done looking for help from people

503
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,410
who are as lost as I am.

504
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,121
<i>I'm Teddy.</i>

505
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,281
<i>And I'm Nikki.</i>

506
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,680
<i>I'm the best man.</i>

507
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,847
<i>Maid</i> of honor.

508
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,365
<i>Welcome for their first dance</i>

509
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,523
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Grotsky!</i>

510
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,451
<i>Get this party started!</i>

511
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,446
<i>See the people
walking down the street</i>

512
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,164
<i>Fall in line
just watching all their feet</i>

513
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,891
<i>They don't know
where they want to go</i>

514
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,928
<i>But they're walking in time</i>

515
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,442
<i>They got the beat
They got the beat</i>

516
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,684
<i>They got the beat
Yeah, they got the beat</i>

517
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,525
Hi.
No.

518
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,965
Of course not.

519
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,404
Hello. Lam Renzo
representing House Eckberg.

520
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,165
Uh-huh. Okay.

521
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,085
I'm Luke Pfaffler.

522
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,965
Can I help you with something?

523
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,721
Mr. Pfaffler?

524
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,325
May I have a word
with your daughter?

525
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,529
Oh, this is not my daughter.
She's just my tablemate today.

526
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,170
Can I ask what her name is?

527
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,846
Megan-Ann.

528
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,121
There it is.

529
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,170
I may come to you one day

530
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,890
asking for Megan-Ann's hand
in marriage.

531
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,286
She's not my daughter.

532
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,489
But today, I'm only going to ask
for her hand in this dance.

533
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,961
And the rest of her,
along with her body.

534
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,971
Good. No,
I don't think that's...

535
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,371
You don't want to dance, right?

536
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,164
No.
She doesn't want to dance.

537
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,125
Maybe I should have a word
with her actual father?

538
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,366
He's not here.

539
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,641
Same with mine.

540
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,849
Okay, I think this
conversation is over, right?

541
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,843
Because it started with
you asking for a dance

542
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,729
and then the answer
to that was no.

543
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,929
First, can I ask if she'd like to
hear about my extracurriculars?

544
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,571
Okay. I'm gonna go out
on a limb here,

545
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,962
Rezno, and say that she has
evaluated the whole package,

546
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,441
including the
after-school specials

547
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,603
and she's not really ready
to dance with that, okay?

548
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,322
So you could just stand awkwardly
in front of another table.

549
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,805
Oh, okay.

550
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,803
Thank you
for the clarity of that.

551
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,522
That was bracing, so thank you.

552
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,007
My pleasure.

553
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,523
Would it matter
if I'm in a band?

554
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
What instrument?

555
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,210
Lyrics.
No.

556
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,842
<i>We got the beat</i>

557
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,802
<i>We got the beat</i>

558
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,406
Well, that was weird.

559
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,642
I thought we were gonna be
murdered there for a second.

560
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,767
Mmm-hmm.

561
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,162
Oh, my God, the
lighting in here is brutal!

562
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,483
God!

563
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,044
My dance number is next and
I cannot look like my hair

564
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,327
just got humped by a hurricane.

565
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,931
Hello, Carol.

566
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,730
I must look
very different to you

567
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,326
since the last time
we saw each other.

568
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,642
O-M-G! Oh!

569
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,646
That's mortifying
that I would forget.

570
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,286
Nanny Jo.

571
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,002
Well, you've had
a lot on your plate.

572
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,969
No, I am a Champagne
mental patient.

573
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,451
It is inexcusable.

574
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,124
No, it's fine.
No, it's not.

575
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,406
No, it's fine.

576
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,851
No, it's not fine.

577
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,856
On, my God.

578
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,008
All right. We have to catch
up one of these years,

579
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,570
when my brain is
made of less liquid.

580
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,971
We will die laughing.

581
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,530
One of these years.

582
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,042
My daughter is
a goddamn married woman!

583
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,246
The funny thing is,
the bloke doesn't realize

584
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,683
he's on the ninth green with
his pants around his ankles!

585
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,201
Funny.

586
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,689
This...
is my nephew.

587
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,001
Hello.

588
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,887
My name is Walter and I'm
a successful businessman.

589
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,843
Nice. What line of work
are you in?

590
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,083
I could ask you
the same question.

591
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,286
Me?
Yeah.

592
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,328
Oh, I'm in beer
and wine distribution.

593
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,289
Same.
Oh, you are?

594
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,203
Ever heard of a guy named
Donny Haczyk?

595
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,405
Yes. He's a knobhead.

596
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,124
- He's a what?
- A knobhead.

597
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,690
Like a dickhead.

598
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,286
I'm Donny Haczyk.

599
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,882
Good to see you again, Donny.

600
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,604
<i>And pull her close
and there, there, there</i>

601
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,602
<i>And take your baby by the ears</i>

602
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,645
<i>And play upon her darkest fears</i>

603
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:01,087
<i>We were so in phase</i>

604
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,203
<i>In our dance hall days</i>

605
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,600
On, boy.

606
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,650
People do weird things
at weddings.

607
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,370
What was I ever thinking?

608
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,250
It's so weird, one day you
can be 100%, the next...

609
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,924
Are you hungry?

610
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,009
Because there's a plate
of pigs in a blanket

611
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,684
about to come through that door.

612
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,801
Just grab it.

613
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,167
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

614
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,810
How did you...

615
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,122
My sense of smell
is my best feature.

616
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,281
Ooh!

617
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,251
Was that a bread roll?

618
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,285
Happy Anniversary.

619
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,044
What's wrong with you?

620
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,406
What are we doing here?

621
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,963
What if I'm just here
to enjoy all of this?

622
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,926
Huh? We used to dance, Jerry.

623
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,968
Why can't I just be here
to reminisce

624
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,725
on the early days
of Bina and Jerry?

625
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,847
Please.

626
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,001
I give up.

627
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,206
Where's Mr. Manny?

628
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,651
Mr. Manny?

629
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,085
A lady at Table 4 says she tries

630
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,936
to eat her own weight in
purple cabbage every week.

631
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,296
How do I figure out if the kitchen
has that much purple cabbage?

632
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,924
I don't know
why you're telling me...

633
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,451
Okay, forget it.

634
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,045
Take this. Take it.

635
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,531
I'll find Mr. Manny myself.

636
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,249
Oh, come on!
Hmm.

637
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,680
I should go somewhere.

638
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,290
Yeah, I mean...

639
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,805
You should be
traveling the world.

640
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,881
Hmm.

641
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,616
I've never actually
been outside the country.

642
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,881
It almost happened
after high school

643
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,136
but I had to get a job answering
phones at a car dealership

644
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,764
and my supposed
friends couldn't wait.

645
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,849
So now I find myself
thinking that this guy...

646
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,729
You, guy...

647
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:50,485
seem like the kind of
person who, in fact,

648
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,450
did not have to get a job
at Lukazey's Toyota

649
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,649
and has been to Europe
or some such

650
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,042
and knows where one goes to...

651
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,005
To what?

652
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,362
Oh. Well. Uh...

653
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,285
I'd probably say this corner right
here is where I'd go for that.

654
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,400
We have no <i>past</i>

655
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,807
<i>We won't reach back</i>

656
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,245
<i>Keep with me forward</i>

657
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,805
<i>AH through the night
And once we start</i>

658
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,008
<i>The meter clicks</i>

659
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,082
Ugh. I'm drunk, Teddy.

660
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,965
Please don't let me
make a fool of myself.

661
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,249
Mom, you could never
make a fool of yourself.

662
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,761
You couldn't make it.
Not possible.

663
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,290
<i>All through the night</i>

664
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,682
<i>Stray cat is crying,
so stray cat sings back</i>

665
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,002
- What are we doing?
- We're dancing.

666
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,241
And also?

667
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,689
Maybe making somebody jealous.

668
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,000
Okay-

669
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,042
Sorry.
Bit too much?

670
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,121
It's a little too much.

671
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,524
You know,
this isn't really dancing.

672
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,523
Oh?
Uh-uh.

673
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,648
This is dancing.

674
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,609
On...

675
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,170
Watch it!

676
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,081
What?

677
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,960
<i>Keep with me forward
all through the night</i>

678
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,367
<i>And once we start</i>

679
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,761
<i>The meter clicks</i>

680
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,921
<i>And it goes on running</i>

681
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,840
<i>All through the night</i>

682
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,241
<i>We have no past</i>

683
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,846
<i>We won't reach back</i>

684
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:55,767
<i>Keep with me forward
all through the night</i>

685
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,366
<i>And once we start</i>

686
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,841
<i>The meter clicks</i>

687
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,801
<i>And it goes running
all through the night</i>

688
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,360
<i>Until it ends</i>

689
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,809
<i>There is no end</i>

690
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,527
It was lovely to dance with you.

691
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,289
How did I not just get kissed?

692
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,328
It happens more often
than you think.

693
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,241
Hmm...

694
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,683
Uh...
I'm Eloise, by the way.

695
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,046
Who are you?

696
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,366
Huck.

697
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,521
Huck?

698
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,566
No one's really
named Huck anymo... Okay.

699
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,883
Huck, we are in a grand
ballroom full of tables.

700
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,724
I'm at the very worst one.

701
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,689
Would you care to join me?

702
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,087
I shouldn't.

703
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,447
Sure.

704
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,929
Oh, seriously?
Yeah.

705
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,042
Oh, God, you're not
somebody's date in there, are you?

706
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,567
No.

707
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,168
Because you're not at a table.
You're crashing the wedding?

708
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,880
You gotta stay for the food.

709
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,161
Oh, do I?

710
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,056
Yeah, that's why people come
to weddings. For free food.

711
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,445
Oh, is that so?

712
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,521
Yeah.

713
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,403
And to meet somebody.

714
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,325
<i>Hello? Hello? Hey, everybody.</i>

715
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,085
<i>Best man.
Best man, toast time.</i>

716
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,844
Yeah.

717
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,605
<i>Yeah. Now, I got a few things
that I'd like to say.</i>

718
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,364
<i>Well, it's hard to believe
any relationship</i>

719
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,608
<i>that had its start at
McCormick's 80s Karaoke Night</i>

720
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,816
<i>could possibly
amount to anything</i>

721
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,968
<i>more than a one-night
stand...</i>

722
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,281
<i>but it did and here
we are and it's perfect.</i>

723
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,965
<i>I guess, you know,
to all those who</i>

724
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,610
<i>want to see how it's done,</i>

725
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,604
<i>how people can and should be
there for each other,</i>

726
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,808
<i>look no further than table one.</i>

727
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,336
<i>You're a better couple
than we've seen</i>

728
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,089
<i>in our family in</i> a <i>long,
long time.</i>

729
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,322
<i>So, yeah, in honor of that</i>

730
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,244
<i>I've got a few things
I'd like to say about love.</i>

731
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,496
This friend cf mine, Clarence,
once stood up during lunch period

732
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,761
and said he had something
to say about love.

733
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,808
Then he took a dump
on the table.

734
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,486
<i>When Francie first met Doug,</i>

735
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,207
<i>she just always knew
that he'd never let her down.</i>

736
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,960
<i>But I thought</i>

737
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,366
<i>people almost
always let you down,</i>

738
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,963
<i>so where did that come from?</i>

739
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,442
<i>Maybe she realized that</i>

740
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,087
<i>whenever he did let her down,</i>

741
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,007
<i>maybe she'd just be always
ready to forgive him.</i>

742
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,969
Whoo!

743
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,445
<i>Come on up here, Nikki.</i>

744
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,842
<i>Save me, please.</i>

745
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,968
<i>I don't know
what I'm saying anymore.</i>

746
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,405
<i>Maid of honor toast time!</i>

747
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,921
Oh...

748
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,681
Let's go.

749
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
What?

750
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,245
She's none of our business.

751
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,244
Who knows what that girl
will do to herself?

752
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,641
We don't, because we don't
know anything about her.

753
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,416
She's temperamental.
She hasn't had a drink

754
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,647
and now she's puked up
mini hotdogs.

755
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,885
Do none of you care that that
girl is obviously pregnant?

756
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,325
What?
Huh?

757
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,449
You children are
such a disappointment.

758
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,649
Go away, please.

759
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,371
You're right. Teddy Millner
was always rotten.

760
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,561
You don't know me.

761
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,769
No, he was selfish,
rude, mumbling.

762
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,126
Always mumbling.

763
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,885
In love with whatever toy
his mother got him

764
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,564
until she got him a new one

765
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,290
and then he just moved right on.

766
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,725
Please go away. Please.

767
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,882
I got his sister Francie
a bird that I found

768
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,884
at a Chinese gift store
in New York City.

769
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,928
Well, Teddy got jealous.

770
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,963
So the next time
I was in New York,

771
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,963
I went out of my way,

772
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,724
skipped a blind date

773
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,649
my aunt tried to set me up on...

774
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,370
Please get out.
skipped a date,

775
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,081
to find Teddy the same
bird his sister cherished.

776
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,606
Well, he played with it
for one day!

777
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,921
I never saw the bird again.

778
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,764
My whole life might have been

779
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,491
something else
if I'd gone on that date.

780
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,210
But what's done is done.

781
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,965
No. Wait.
I know what happened.

782
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,489
He ended it with a text message

783
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,608
when you told him
you were pregnant.

784
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,521
Oh...

785
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,166
Jesus!

786
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,641
Never doubt a nanny's intuition.

787
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,051
It's true?
Yes.

788
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,536
Can everybody just
get out of here, please?

789
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,561
So what do we do?

790
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,696
What do you mean,
"What do we do?"

791
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,563
To teach that asshole a lesson.
Oh, Lord.

792
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,120
No, I don't want to do anything
that will jeopardize my freedom

793
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,407
to run my successful business.

794
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,244
That's right.
Let's just please go back

795
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,816
to the table before
they think we've left.

796
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,763
What do you care what
anyone here thinks, Bina?

797
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,320
Stop. That was
an overreaction, okay?

798
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,687
I had too many of
the mini hotdogs and...

799
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,326
Can we just forget about it?

800
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,481
That won't be easy.

801
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,449
Teddy Millner is leaving you

802
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,490
to raise a child alone.
If you even go...

803
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,609
Oh, my God.

804
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,842
If you even go through
with the pregnancy.

805
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,002
Okay, no. This is
no one's business, okay?

806
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,286
We're going back to the table.

807
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,089
Let's get out of
the ladies' bathroom.

808
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,376
Francie's still my friend, and
I'm not gonna mess up her day

809
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,856
by doing something
to her dumb brother.

810
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,370
What if Francie
never needs to know?

811
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,125
Jerry, stop. She said
she's done with it.

812
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,209
Well, no.

813
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,776
No. For once, I'm not gonna do
the thing I immediately regret.

814
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,376
Renzo, if I gave you
a couple hundred bucks,

815
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,736
could you get a hooker
to wait in Teddy's room?

816
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,096
Oh, I was asking the hotel that very
same question about my own room.

817
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,456
I don't want to get
involved with hookers.

818
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,481
They don't provide them.

819
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,616
You guys probably already know
this, but that's not a question

820
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,936
you're supposed to ask
a fancy place like this

821
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,485
unless you're
a successful businessman.

822
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,641
Which I am.

823
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,688
Are you okay?
You looked like you got sick.

824
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,976
I'm fine. Please get lost.
Excuse me.

825
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,525
Hello. Jerry Kepp.

826
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,443
Diner associate
on the Grotsky side.

827
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,560
Hello.

828
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,045
Did you or did you not
dump this girl

829
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,684
after getting her pregnant?
Oh, my God.

830
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,206
I'm sorry, what's going
on now? I'm just...

831
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,282
I never did like you,
not even as a child.

832
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:05,329
Teddy Millner, did you dump
this girl immediately

833
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,687
after she told you
she was pregnant?

834
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,760
Okay-

835
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,096
You didn't tell them
what you said.

836
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,361
Wait, what did you say?
What did I say?

837
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,205
She said that we'd be
ridiculous parents.

838
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,891
No, I... Not like that.

839
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,086
Yes, you did.

840
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,606
You said I'd be
a ridiculous father.

841
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,569
You asked me
if I wanted to keep it.

842
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,086
Then I asked you if you
would want to keep it

843
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,242
and you didn't say
anything to that.

844
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,641
So then I said
we were ridiculous.

845
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,200
It was after
you called me ridiculous

846
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,086
because why would you
want to keep our kid

847
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,806
if you thought
that I was just a...

848
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,530
That I was just a joke?

849
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,449
It was before.

850
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:45,602
And you were looking
for a way out, man!

851
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,727
I get that now.

852
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,564
Everyone we know says
we were wrong together.

853
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,404
Your mother wouldn't
stop saying that

854
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,165
I was not the kind of girl
who ended up with you.

855
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,165
And when it was time for you to
stand up and say that she's wrong

856
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,925
and they're all wrong and
they're idiots and stand by me,

857
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,049
then you ask me
if I want to keep it.

858
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,682
That's your first question.

859
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,281
What was I supposed to say, El?

860
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,682
I constantly disappoint you.

861
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,049
Then you tell me
that you think our kid

862
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,851
will grow up thinking
that I'm just a joke.

863
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,687
That I was never
good enough for you.

864
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,051
And you finally found
a way to tell me.

865
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,202
And I was so scared
of losing you that

866
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,408
when you told me
you were pregnant,

867
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,051
lasked if you
wanted to keep the kid.

868
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,248
I'm ridiculous
in a million ways.

869
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,049
I am. I know that.

870
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,206
But I can't spend my whole life

871
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,044
disappointing you“

872
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,441
as much as I disappoint myself.

873
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,646
Shit.

874
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,046
I'm sorry.

875
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,851
Hey, stop.

876
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,167
Teddy! Stop! Teddy!

877
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,480
Leave me alone.

878
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,608
No, Teddy!
No, he doesn't get...

879
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,325
on.

880
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,847
Oh, my God.

881
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,002
No, we can fix this.
We can fix this. No, Teddy.

882
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,206
On!

883
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,606
Oh! I'm sorry.

884
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,051
I've been hit.

885
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,046
- Oh...
- Shit.

886
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,810
Oh, my God.

887
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,881
Oh...

888
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,646
Oh, shit.

889
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,886
Oh, my God.

890
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,811
But I'm ridiculous?

891
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,170
<i>Shake it up</i>

892
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,966
Thank you.

893
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,926
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

894
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,049
Let's go. Thank you.

895
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,645
<i>Shake it up</i>

896
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,804
<i>Shake it up</i>

897
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,964
<i>Yeah, shake it up</i>

898
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,041
Oh...

899
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,801
You want me to call Mr.
Manny on these people?

900
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:49,241
I have a confession to make.

901
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,050
I'm not actually
a successful businessman.

902
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,526
I was in prison because I stole

903
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:00,002
$125,000 from
the father of the bride.

904
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,004
It was not a table of honor.

905
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,763
I have a bag of dope in my room.

906
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,571
Room 115 for the dope

907
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,290
in case any of you feel that

908
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,204
a bag of dope
would be fun to do.

909
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,805
Not you.

910
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,961
And not you.

911
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:31,285
You two can drop by and choose
something from the mini fridge.

912
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,365
That was the worst invitation to
anything I've ever received, ever.

913
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,490
Is your room this way?

914
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,164
Or are you just following us?

915
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,601
Who, me?
Just following.

916
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,562
<i>Honestly, it still sounds
better than junior prom, honey.</i>

917
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,971
<i>Junior prom is a horror show.</i>

918
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,720
Well, if the thinking was for me
to see people at their most happy,

919
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,446
I would have to say that seems
to be a huge miscalculation.

920
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,607
<i>Did you just break
another chair?</i>

921
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,888
What kind of nanny are you?

922
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,371
Retired.

923
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,167
Wow, the last time
Jerry and I did this

924
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,641
was the last time
Jerry and I had sex.

925
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,366
Three... Actually,
over three years ago.

926
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,529
But no one's counting.

927
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,801
Oh, thank you.

928
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,368
You don't have to do this.

929
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,568
It might be best.
If Uncle Roger finds out,

930
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,642
he might tell my parole officer

931
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,404
and then they'd
send me back to jail

932
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,562
or extend my time
at the halfway house.

933
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,086
I share a room with a man
called Jalapeno

934
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,889
who has a smiley face tattooed

935
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,088
on the end of his penis
so that when he pees

936
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,083
it looks like
it's vomiting sunshine.

937
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,847
He's not as sweet as he sounds.

938
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,044
Well, then you shouldn't do it.

939
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,203
Jalapeno doesn't sound like
a good roommate.

940
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,246
No.

941
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,531
I don't know, unless Uncle Roger

942
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,800
is lurking around outside the
door, I mean...

943
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,882
Is it Uncle Roger?
Nope.

944
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,521
Hi.

945
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,123
I just wanted to say sorry.

946
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,246
I take things too far.

947
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,163
Usually, I'm the only
one who gets hurt,

948
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,130
but it didn't work out like
that today, so I'm sorry.

949
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,247
Join us.

950
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,886
Or do you have
somewhere else to be?

951
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,566
No.

952
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,649
<i>You know, a whole table
disappeared from a wedding</i>

953
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,483
<i>and I bet no one even knows.</i>

954
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,483
We can go anywhere, do anything.

955
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,130
The day is ours.

956
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:52,769
Hello. My name is Walter
and I'm a successful pothead.

957
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,166
I'm smoking the reefer.

958
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,208
Who smokes pot?
Are you a potter?

959
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,930
- No.
- No?

960
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,287
You're a pothead.

961
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,167
<i>You got a table
with a lot of your friends</i>

962
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,004
<i>Waitin' for your ship to come in</i>

963
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:12,323
<i>Folks like me on the job
from nine to five</i>

964
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,843
Concierge, please.

965
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,041
Hi.

966
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:28,285
Um, can you tell me
when the next ferry arrives?

967
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,488
<i>In</i> about 30 minutes.
Okay. Thanks.

968
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,803
There's a dog in your bathtub.

969
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,241
See? That's what I
mean about hotel bathtubs.

970
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,803
<i>You know, marriage is
till death do us part.</i>

971
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,203
<i>What does that mean? Does that
mean you're gonna get to heaven</i>

972
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,850
<i>and then you'll be single,</i>

973
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,446
<i>and then do whatever
you want at that point?</i>

974
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,567
<i>Maybe.</i>

975
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,211
<i>Nobody knows
what happens after you die.</i>

976
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,971
<i>You are Romeo and Juliet</i>

977
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,203
<i>and we all wish you
the same happy ending.</i>

978
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,408
<i>Congratulations,
and best of luck.</i>

979
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,484
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a magician.

980
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,730
I always wanted to be
a nightclub singer.

981
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,284
Fiction writer.

982
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,970
Now I own a diner.

983
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,281
Bina took over
her family's diner.

984
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,089
And I got suckered
into managing it

985
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:18,969
after we got married
just like she wanted.

986
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,041
Like I wanted?

987
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,360
Who else would've wanted that?

988
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,363
You asked my father
if you could.

989
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,444
You renamed the family
diner after yourself.

990
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:28,244
That was your idea.
What?

991
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,367
Uh-huh.

992
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,646
I wanted to be a high school guidance
counselor but instead I went to prison.

993
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,529
You made the right decision.

994
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,284
How did you steal
all that money?

995
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,649
Right. Yeah, well, uh...

996
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,162
Roger got me a job in his office

997
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,880
when he worked
for the Ford Motor Company.

998
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,964
I'm quite good with numbers,

999
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,050
so I worked out a way
to steal $125,000.

1000
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,285
So I did.

1001
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,283
What did you do with it?

1002
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,361
Oh, it wasn't for myself.

1003
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,011
My friend Eric, who's an absolute
sweetheart, a lovely bloke,

1004
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,969
his wife was very sick
and needed an operation.

1005
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,963
Well, then you saved a life.

1006
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,442
No. Because it turned out she
wasn't as sick <i>as</i> we thought.

1007
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,602
On account of the fact
she didn't exist.

1008
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,456
I don't think
he'd ever been married.

1009
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,481
What?

1010
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,003
He made it up
just for the money.

1011
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,416
You just called him
a sweetheart!

1012
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,841
He was a lovely bloke.
He was always nice to me.

1013
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,761
Except for when he made me
go to prison.

1014
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,883
Renzo.
Yeah, what?

1015
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,051
What's with the fur tie?

1016
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:29,246
Oh, thank you.

1017
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,486
It's pretty dumb.

1018
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,005
No, come on.

1019
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,048
Yeah, it is. It is.

1020
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,208
My mom believed it would

1021
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:44,290
ever so slightly
convey my sexual prowess.

1022
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,400
Clonk.

1023
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,002
Terrible parents were
my bread and butter.

1024
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,000
Remember that suit
I was wearing earlier?

1025
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,480
The chaplain from the halfway
house got me that from Goodwill.

1026
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,122
And then now I'm wearing
the suit of a beautiful lady.

1027
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,766
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.

1028
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,921
You wear it well.

1029
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:08,487
No. I look all right.

1030
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,731
Wait. Why didn't
your dad stop you?

1031
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,723
Well, this is my dad's,
actually.

1032
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,606
He's dead now, which is
why I get to wear it. So...

1033
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,160
Did he say...

1034
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,647
Yeah.

1035
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,521
Sorry for laughing
about your dead dad.

1036
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:30,564
Hey, no... Guys, no.
It's not all that.

1037
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,768
I barely knew the guy, so...

1038
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,444
Strangers die
all the time, right?

1039
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,648
I mean, 150 people
die every second.

1040
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,323
150 people right there.

1041
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,886
Can't get worked up over it.

1042
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:43,121
You know?

1043
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,361
Better?

1044
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,046
No, not really.

1045
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,810
Thank you for trying.

1046
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,489
My junior prom is tonight.

1047
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,651
But my mom said I'd

1048
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,401
probably have a better chance
here where nobody knew me, so...

1049
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,401
I would have danced with you.

1050
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,927
Now, in high school, I certainly
would have danced with you.

1051
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,084
And if you want to dance now,

1052
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,369
we can just turn on
the radio and just dance.

1053
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,007
I don't think so, but thank you.

1054
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,283
<i>You smiled</i>

1055
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,804
<i>You smiled</i>

1056
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,681
<i>And then the spell was cast</i>

1057
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,004
Now here we are in heaven

1058
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,051
<i>'Cause you are mine</i>

1059
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,246
<i>At last</i>

1060
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,281
<i>Fuck.</i>

1061
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,567
Here, Ringo! Here, Ringo.

1062
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,610
Wonder how my daughter's
gonna feel not having a dad?

1063
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:46,761
Daughter?

1064
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,966
Yeah.

1065
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,089
I mean, I know it's too early
to know, but... I know.

1066
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:56,122
Well, I have a request.
Don't call her Jo.

1067
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,361
I met you today and you think I'm
gonna name my daughter after you?

1068
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,164
No, of course not.

1069
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,728
I've been a nanny to a lot
of children who've grown up

1070
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,922
and if they don't see fit...

1071
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:11,729
I really just wanted
to volunteer that

1072
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,326
Jo is a good enough
name for a boy,

1073
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,971
but a terrible curse for a girl.

1074
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,288
Now let's see, a girl's name...

1075
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:28,489
The only girl's name I can
think of right now is Nikki.

1076
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,521
Well, it won't be Nikki, so...

1077
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:39,045
Look, it's a wedding
I won't ruin.

1078
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,169
I should go back in.

1079
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,088
Tell Francie about the cake.

1080
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,164
Let's sit out
for a little while.

1081
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,451
The world feels
almost perfect right now.

1082
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,249
Crap!

1083
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,091
That's cool.
I'm cool.

1084
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,931
I know why you came!

1085
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,367
You love weddings? Please.

1086
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,681
You couldn't get through
our wedding day fast enough.

1087
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,806
It's funny it took me
so long because honestly,

1088
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,000
Bina, I didn't think you had
it in you to surprise me.

1089
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,530
Okay.
Yeah.

1090
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:26,046
You're many things, Bina, but
surprising is not one of them.

1091
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,526
When you went to the bathroom in the
nanny's room, you used the phone.

1092
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:31,601
Uh-huh.

1093
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,256
I know this because
a little light came on

1094
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,009
in the bedroom
when you did that.

1095
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,562
Okay.
So, who did you call, Bina?

1096
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,604
You only know two people at this
wedding and I'm one of them.

1097
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:44,082
You're arranging to meet with Henry
Grotsky after the Wedding's over?

1098
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,322
Hmm? Maybe back
in the ballroom

1099
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,044
after the happy couple is gone

1100
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,610
and I'm upstairs in the room?

1101
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,126
You're gonna sell our diner
to Henry Grotsky.

1102
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:56,166
You don't out-detective me,
Bina Kepp.

1103
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,042
I came to have an affair.

1104
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,401
Ha-ha.

1105
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,602
No way. I know you.

1106
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,403
Bina, an affair?

1107
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,921
Bina!

1108
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,566
Walter, would you come
with me, please?

1109
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,768
Yeah. I'm flattered.

1110
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,766
Goodbye.

1111
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,121
Goodbye.

1112
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,404
I should just let you
know that I've got

1113
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,721
a little bit of eczema
behind my knees.

1114
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:03,964
And, um, oh, last year I had
a cold sore,

1115
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,089
but that was because Jalapeno
was using my washcloth.

1116
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,804
And not just on his face.

1117
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,601
But, yeah, otherwise,
I'm all fine so

1118
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,961
just let me know when you want
to start the intercourse.

1119
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,485
What?
What?

1120
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:17,801
What?

1121
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,049
Sorry, why am I here?

1122
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,646
Not that.

1123
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,690
I'm sorry.
Okay.

1124
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,324
<i>But no.
No'?</i>

1125
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:27,851
Was it talking about Jalapeno

1126
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,122
washing his testicles
that ruined the mood?

1127
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,531
Um... Sure.

1128
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,650
How bad is it?

1129
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,801
Pot.

1130
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,004
It's medicinal, right?

1131
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,246
We could open our own
ladies' detective agency.

1132
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,362
Put Mr. Kepp out of business.

1133
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,486
How bad?

1134
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,369
Oh, I'd say that

1135
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,569
I'm due around
the same time you are.

1136
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,127
So?

1137
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:47,881
What did he say?

1138
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:49,376
He said that I should be
in the Woodside

1139
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,890
ballroom serving hors d'oeuvres

1140
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,650
because they're
understaffed, apparently.

1141
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,480
Did you have a chance
to ask the thing

1142
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,085
I sent you over there for?

1143
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,851
Oh, yes. Yes. Denny,
who's that man there,

1144
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,376
he said that there's
no one registered

1145
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,050
under the name you asked about.

1146
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,081
Huh. Did you say
the right name?

1147
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:09,766
Yeah, Denny. It's on his nametag.
I saw it.

1148
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,842
Right. Not him.
Oh, Fo, yes.

1149
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,003
I said Tom Fo. "Ls there
a Tom Fo here?", I said.

1150
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,969
And he said...
He said, "No."

1151
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,562
Okay. Right.
No Fo.

1152
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,000
Yeah.

1153
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:22,681
Sorry.

1154
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,728
God, that's so weird.

1155
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,240
Walter?

1156
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,850
Yes.
Where are you going?

1157
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,416
I gotta go and help with
the hors d'oeuvres

1158
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,124
in the Woodside ballroom.
Why?

1159
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,526
Understaffed.

1160
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:36,362
So, you're not
the friendliest guy in the world.

1161
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:37,601
I am not.

1162
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,489
How did you manage
to seduce Bina?

1163
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,644
Bad timing? It is bad
timing, I realize that now.

1164
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,926
If I tell you this, will
you stop walking with me?

1165
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,050
Not sure.
It was summer camp.

1166
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:53,966
I was a junior counselor.
She was a senior counselor.

1167
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,884
Honestly, Renzo,
it's no big secret.

1168
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,122
Camp does most of the seducing.

1169
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,408
Less often than you think.
Oh.

1170
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,690
Well, for me,
I was okay at dancing.

1171
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,241
Probably better than okay.
So we danced.

1172
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,808
And that's it.
That's all it takes.

1173
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:13,609
Find out the one thing
you're good at,

1174
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,409
make sure the girls
know about it.

1175
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,490
Even if it's something
very private?

1176
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,490
My understanding of women
seems poor right now.

1177
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,642
I'd say go with your gut.

1178
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,570
Ah...

1179
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,083
Francie doesn't even
remember me, does she?

1180
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,007
Ah, those rotten kids.

1181
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,000
What did you
ever see in that boy?

1182
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,930
I can't even think about it.

1183
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:01,362
What if you came here
for a different reason today?

1184
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,528
What if you went away
with someone better?

1185
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:12,046
What if I know how to find
your wedding crasher?

1186
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,240
Go with your gut. Go with your gut.
Go with your gut.

1187
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,648
Megan-Ann, Mr. Pfaffler,

1188
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,404
you probably don't remember me.

1189
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:26,851
We're not going to
talk about it.

1190
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,490
Of course not.

1191
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,404
Let's just watch the kid
in his moment of triumph.

1192
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:34,330
There is something I forgot to mention
the first time I arrived here,

1193
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,926
and that is that I have
a gigantic penis.

1194
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:38,326
Excuse me?
Oh, my God!

1195
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,606
Oh...

1196
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:41,886
Oh, shit.

1197
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:44,361
That's disgusting. This
wedding is over for you.

1198
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,056
I need you to give me
the phone number of somebody

1199
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:47,936
that I can call to get you out
of here right now.

1200
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,246
Oh! Mmm-mmm.

1201
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:54,969
So... Mr. Pfaffler
said he's gonna call my mom.

1202
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,530
And the girl?

1203
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,011
She started to cry.

1204
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,283
I think I didn't
describe it appealingly.

1205
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,886
We'll work on the wording
before you try again.

1206
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,926
You're coming with me.

1207
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,605
Hello, friend.
Just stay right there.

1208
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,486
Is this the guy you meant?

1209
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,524
Nope. I'm pregnant
with his baby,

1210
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,965
but not the guy I'm looking for.

1211
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:21,127
Wow. One cigarette break and
you miss an awful lot, right?

1212
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,051
Oh. This guy?

1213
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,409
That guy, this guy.
Huck something.

1214
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,491
Yeah. I know who that guy is,
but his name is not Huck.

1215
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,204
No one's really named
Huck anymore.

1216
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,405
Oh, shit.

1217
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:42,686
Right.

1218
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,450
Okay, let's go.

1219
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,330
Come on!
Yeah.

1220
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:09,206
<i>Only you are my shining star</i>

1221
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,410
<i>Don't you go away</i>

1222
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,888
<i>Yeah, baby</i>

1223
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:22,169
<i>Wanna be right here
where you are</i>

1224
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,609
<i>Until my dying day</i>

1225
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,571
<i>Yeah, baby</i>

1226
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,565
Nice bit of cake?

1227
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:04,051
Oh, Nanny Jo, everybody...

1228
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,691
Sorry it's taken us
so crazy long to get here.

1229
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,160
We're so glad
you could all make it.

1230
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,202
You're the Kepps, right?
Yeah.

1231
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,209
My mom says
your fries are better

1232
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,601
than the ones in
all of my dad's diners.

1233
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,326
Well, that's not what
I thought I'd leave with here today,

1234
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,731
but it's something,
so thank you.

1235
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,801
Sure.

1236
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,371
We hope it all
works out for you.

1237
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,601
It'd be great if it did.

1238
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,203
Cousin Walter?
I'm glad you could come.

1239
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:30,044
Thank you for inviting me.

1240
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,645
It was simply amazing.

1241
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,281
Truly wonderful day.

1242
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,811
Oh, thank you.

1243
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,121
Ah.

1244
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,844
He's such a great guy.
Yeah.

1245
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,206
Sorry about being
so far away from you today.

1246
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,327
No.

1247
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,656
I felt like we weren't even
in the same place, you know?

1248
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,241
No. It's the same wedding no matter
what table you're at, right?

1249
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,367
Yeah.

1250
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:59,285
I'm so glad you came over because
I was just saying I'm so tired.

1251
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,931
Gonna head out.
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

1252
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,604
Okay, so...

1253
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,409
You look so beautiful.
Thank you.

1254
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,005
And congratulations
or best wishes

1255
01:08:07,080 --> 01:08:08,889
or whatever
you're supposed to say.

1256
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,284
And this was great.

1257
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,326
BYE, guys.

1258
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,851
Have a good night.

1259
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,201
Hey-

1260
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,965
I know I'm probably
the last person

1261
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,690
in the world you ever
want to see again.

1262
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,360
And I get that.
Totally understand.

1263
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,249
And it will probably suck
for you to have to

1264
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,368
see me again
under any circumstances

1265
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:43,046
which is why
I wanted to say that

1266
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:46,369
whatever happened between
us and however it ended

1267
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:48,882
I think, you know,

1268
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:53,211
I could be a really good dad,

1269
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:55,801
probably, if you'll just...

1270
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,405
If you'll let me.

1271
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,243
So, that's it.

1272
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,280
Goodbye.

1273
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,765
What are you doing?

1274
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,126
I don't know how you fixed this,

1275
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,009
but it really meant a lot.

1276
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,843
<i>Well, it's been so
great to catch up with you all.</i>

1277
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,291
I hope you all got to dance

1278
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:39,368
to your heart's content.

1279
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:42,331
Do you still have
the golden bird?

1280
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:45,840
Oh, Nanny Jo.

1281
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,124
You don't even
remember it, do you?

1282
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,124
No, of course I do.

1283
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,890
I don't know why I should
be embarrassed about this,

1284
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:57,362
but I lost it almost immediately
after you gave it to me.

1285
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:59,761
I cried so hard
Teddy gave me his.

1286
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:01,325
He was always good like that.

1287
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,686
Francie, we should go.

1288
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,847
<i>Okay.</i>

1289
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,684
Thanks again for coming,
everyone.

1290
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,136
It wouldn't have been
the same without you.

1291
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:09,242
<i>Please proceed to the docks</i>

1292
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,130
<i>to see off
Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Grotsky.</i>

1293
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,167
What is it with you people?

1294
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:21,643
Teddy Millner is the sweetest
child I've ever known.

1295
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:51,766
- Teddy!
- Teddy!

1296
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,000
I don't see him.

1297
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,287
Did he get on? Teddy!

1298
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,205
Teddy!

1299
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:04,965
Teddy!

1300
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,849
On, my God!

1301
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,126
Wait!

1302
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,765
Too late! Sorry!

1303
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,530
I was wrong!

1304
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,647
What?

1305
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:21,971
It's crazy!
It is! It so is!

1306
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,681
It's crazy!
After everything.

1307
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,521
Sweetheart,
you're embarrassing yourself!

1308
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,251
Shut up, Nikki!

1309
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:31,129
Shut up.
What?

1310
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,205
I can't not be in love with you.

1311
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,650
You screw up all the time.

1312
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:39,200
But so do I. Way worse!

1313
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:42,725
Great toast, folks!
Goodnight!

1314
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,802
The baby's a screwup!

1315
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:47,884
Perfect, thank you.
The baby is a...

1316
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,010
Wait, what baby?

1317
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:54,321
It's a great screwup!
It's this perfect screwup!

1318
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,566
What?

1319
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:04,601
I don't want to be disappointed
by anybody but you!

1320
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,163
And I don't want to
disappoint anybody but you.

1321
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,008
What are you saying?

1322
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,451
Please.

1323
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,608
It was Tom Fo, wasn't it?

1324
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,811
What does it matter who?

1325
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:19,928
Doesn't matter, not at all.

1326
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,889
I just like being
a good detective.

1327
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,286
Gives me something.

1328
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,964
Well, he never showed up,

1329
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,361
so it really doesn't matter who.

1330
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:32,170
You know what they say?
Showing up is 90% of love.

1331
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,688
Yeah, and not being an
asshole is the other 10%.

1332
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,411
He didn't show up. I did.

1333
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,084
No, you didn't.

1334
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:43,929
Neither did I.

1335
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,850
And the people we were
supposed to become together,

1336
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,169
they never showed up.

1337
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,450
Was there ever a time you
would have done that for me?

1338
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,729
Just, like, shout out
across a lake at me,

1339
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,405
in front of a bunch
of strangers,

1340
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,687
about how you
really felt about me?

1341
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:12,169
We shout at each other in front
of strangers all the time.

1342
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:14,409
I'll take that as a no.

1343
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,444
Would you do that for me?

1344
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,200
Well, the you then or you now?

1345
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,051
I'm the same.

1346
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,400
No, I'm the same.

1347
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:23,806
No, not really.

1348
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,645
The Bina I married
would never cheat on me.

1349
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,925
Well, the Jerry I married...

1350
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,047
What?

1351
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,721
What?

1352
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:35,328
The Jerry you married what?

1353
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,730
How am I different?

1354
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,290
Because I'm not.

1355
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,601
So stop saying I am.
It's not fair.

1356
01:14:43,880 --> 01:14:46,201
The Jerry I married loved me.

1357
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,206
Yeah, that's what
I thought. Okay.

1358
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,411
We're ridiculous.

1359
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:56,571
We're ridiculous?

1360
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,248
Yeah, everyone
is ridiculous, Jerry!

1361
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,846
Okay? You deal with it
'cause you have to!

1362
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,400
Do you?
Yeah, you do! That's life!

1363
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:07,006
You're ridiculous and a mess!

1364
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:10,451
And you still hope that
you'll find someone

1365
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:14,081
who'll think that you're
okay enough to be loved.

1366
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:17,811
Is that what life is?
Yeah, it is.

1367
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,722
And it's really weird that
you don't know that by now!

1368
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,284
Where are we?

1369
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,361
Guys?

1370
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,765
Where did they go?

1371
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,166
That's the wrong way.

1372
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:36,610
Well, I don't know
which way we're going.

1373
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,762
Wasn't there a shortcut here?
We missed it.

1374
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,250
I showed up.

1375
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,282
Oh, I heard what you said

1376
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,567
to the dumb girl at table seven.

1377
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,040
Well, I didn't word it right.

1378
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,281
No, you're okay.

1379
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,325
Congratulations.

1380
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:13,281
Uh...

1381
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:17,205
Hey, I got these.
Room 430.

1382
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,360
Maybe in a couple of years.

1383
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:20,405
Wait, really?

1384
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,491
Okay, it's booked.
A few years from now.

1385
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,369
Room 430. I'll be there!

1386
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,401
I'll see you
in a couple of years!

1387
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,125
Yes!

1388
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,601
Hey.

1389
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,490
Is there anything left?

1390
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:39,406
Not unless you count the lingering
melancholy that once was joy.

1391
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,684
She means cake.

1392
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,763
Oh. Then, yeah.

1393
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:56,521
Thank you.

1394
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,931
Mmm.

1395
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:07,965
Oh!

1396
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,330
Is it good?

1397
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,811
Yeah, really good.

1398
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:23,646
Oh, shit.

1399
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,122
What did you say?
Oh, my Lord!

1400
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:27,327
Holy shit!

1401
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,926
What did you say
back there? It was...

1402
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:31,361
What did you do?

1403
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,169
It was hard to hear,

1404
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,561
you know, with, like,
the wind and Nikki

1405
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,642
in my ear, and then,

1406
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:40,564
when I got on the railing,
everybody started shouting.

1407
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,211
And then underwater, you can't,

1408
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,448
like, hear anything underwater.

1409
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,085
But it sounded like,

1410
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,481
you know,

1411
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,324
you were getting
to something good.

1412
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:51,961
Um...

1413
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,724
Uh... It was like

1414
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,087
about how, if you're, shit,

1415
01:18:59,160 --> 01:19:02,607
ready to be, like, the person
who always forgives me,

1416
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:05,001
then I want to be the person
who always forgives you.

1417
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:06,570
I don't know,
it was better than that.

1418
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,051
That's really good.

1419
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:09,361
Can we do that?

1420
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,369
Let's do that.
Okay.

1421
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:44,520
<i>Moving forward
using all my breath</i>

1422
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:51,448
<i>Making love to you
was never second best</i>

1423
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:57,162
<i>I saw the world thrashing
all around your face</i>

1424
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:04,005
<i>Never really knowing
it was always mesh and lace</i>

1425
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:08,561
<i>I'll stop the world
and melt with you</i>

1426
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:13,161
<i>You've seen the difference</i>

1427
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,881
<i>And it's getting better
all the time</i>

1428
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,169
<i>There's nothing
you and I won't do</i>

1429
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:26,841
<i>I'll stop the world
and melt with you</i>

1430
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:33,884
<i>Dream of better lives
The kind which never hate</i>

1431
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:35,530
<i>You should see</i>

1432
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:39,804
<i>Dropped in a state
of imaginary grace</i>

1433
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,530
<i>You should know better</i>

1434
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:45,810
<i>I made a pilgrimage
to save this human's race</i>

1435
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,769
<i>You should see</i>

1436
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,167
Goodnight, Mom.

1437
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:50,770
Goodnight, Teddy.

1438
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:52,771
Bye, Carol.

1439
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,963
Thought you didn't have family.

1440
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,491
The evidence is mounting up
against you, Walter.

1441
01:21:37,240 --> 01:21:40,050
Renzo, your study buddy is here!

1442
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:42,324
Hey. Here's your mail.

1443
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,528
Thanks.

1444
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,161
Hi.

1445
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,530
Please don't slam
the door, even for that.

1446
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,367
Ringo??

1447
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:58,891
You're gonna make him fat.

1448
01:21:58,960 --> 01:22:00,405
Oh, yeah, lam.

1449
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:01,970
Well, We are.

1450
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,003
Here you go, Ringo.

1451
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,762
Okay, you're sure
you didn't forget anybody?

1452
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,976
I told you a million times,
okay? I didn't forget anybody.

1453
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,923
Sorry. Thank you.

1454
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,121
You're welcome.

1455
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,851
Okay, so this
is the last batch of...

1456
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,010
Teddy, where's the baby?

1457
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:19,760
Baby. Oh, man!

1458
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,123
Come on, man.
I know, I'm sorry.

1459
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:25,010
It's just, you know,
if you forget the baby...

1460
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,576
I'm not sure
I believe you when you say

1461
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:28,648
you didn't forget
any of our friends.

1462
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,006
Hi!

1463
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,450
Here he is.
Aw!

1464
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,096
The world's best dad
when you don't forget

1465
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,804
<i>our baby in the empty apartment.</i>

1466
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,922
Thank you.
You're welcome.

1467
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:22,809
<i>Hello, my old heart</i>

1468
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:34,046
<i>Hello, my old heart</i>

1469
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:59,446
<i>Hello, my old heart</i>

1470
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,760
<i>Hello, my old heart</i>
