00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,191
NARRATOR:
 Well, ever since our
 last episode,

2
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,360
which was around 1964,
give or take a couple of weeks

3
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,229
there's been a lot of water
  under the bridge.

4
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,898
Walls have fallen,
  governments have toppled.

5
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:35,835
Yes, the winds of freedom have
swept Eastern Europe and the
world will never be the same.

6
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,337
Crowds of people massed
in the streets,

7
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,173
cheering and celebrating
their newfound freedom.

8
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,708
Yes, everyone
  is just delighted.

9
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:44,377
PEOPLE: (IN UNISON) Yay.

10
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,179
NARRATOR:
 All except for one
 little, tiny country

11
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,581
where the cold war
  is still freezing.

12
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,851
A puny, pipsqueak principality
where nastiness is a virtue.

13
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,254
Where being mean and rotten is
the national pastime,

14
00:00:54,287 --> 00:00:56,556
and everyone
spends so much time
double-crossing each other

15
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,925
that they don't even have time
for lunch.

16
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:00,760
Yes, neatly nestled
  between the borders

17
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:03,329
of Wrestlemania and
  Yoursovania, that's right,

18
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,632
ooh boy, you guessed it,
hokey smoke,

19
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:12,138
watch me pull a rabbit out of
my hat, it's that soot capital
of the world, Pottsylvania!

20
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,574
And, as our story opens,
the meanest, nastiest,

21
00:01:14,607 --> 00:01:16,342
no goodnik of them all,

22
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,611
the man they call
  Fearless Leader.

23
00:01:18,645 --> 00:01:20,146
Thank you.
  NARRATOR: You're welcome.

24
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,015
Has a very big problem.

25
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,918
And so he has called
 in his best operative.

26
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:30,190
A man so sinister,
 so dangerous, so badly lit,

27
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:33,626
he's known only as Agent X.

28
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:35,962
Where the hell
 have you been?

29
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,064
I don't see that that's
  any of your business.

30
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,899
NARRATOR:
  With pleasantries
  out of the way,

31
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,601
Fearless Leader explained
  the whole story,

32
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:43,103
beginning with
  the most astonishing

33
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:45,738
scientific breakthrough
 in the history of the world.

34
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:50,510
ANNOUNCER: Presenting time
  reverse microchip

35
00:01:50,543 --> 00:01:52,479
demonstration
 number one.

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,217
The microchip is in place.

37
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:00,420
My brother, Kregor
  will shatter the beaker,

38
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,790
and the release of energy
  will trigger the microchip.

39
00:02:10,563 --> 00:02:11,831
ANNOUNCER:
  Obviously,

40
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,901
the implications of this
  invention are staggering.

41
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:19,138
The microchip freezes
time, then backs
it up three seconds.

42
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:23,376
We can reverse catastrophes,
 save lives,

43
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,311
even protect the military

44
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,781
by rendering
  any object indestructible.

45
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,817
With this remarkable device,

46
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,021
there is virtually no limit
  to the benefit for mankind.

47
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:38,024
We feel this invention
is the most astonishing

48
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:42,262
scientific breakthrough...
  I'm impressed.

49
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:46,699
With a chip like that,
  a man could rule the world.

50
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:51,037
Yes. Unfortunately, three days
 after that film was made,

51
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,706
Paulovitch took the chip
 and disappeared.

52
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,944
I see. And I am
 supposed to find him
 and bring him back.

53
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:01,014
You're the best there is.
  That's why I called for you.

54
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:02,649
And you want me
  to risk my cover

55
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,918
on such a dangerous
 mission as that?

56
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,720
What else do you suggest?

57
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,557
Give me a decoy.

58
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,425
A loyal, trusting agent.

59
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:14,994
Someone expendable,
 a total idiot.

60
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,896
Send him to find
  the Professor.

61
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,966
I will follow
 at a discreet distance,

62
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,001
and the moment Paulovitch
  is found,

63
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,772
I will kill them both and
  return the microchip to you.

64
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,374
Brilliant!

65
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:33,046
Now, who would be
  the perfect decoy?

66
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,415
NARRATOR:
  Who indeed?
  Rodgers and Hammerstein?

67
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:37,850
Sonny and Cher?
Bilbo Baggins?

68
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,986
No, as anybody who looked
  at their tickets before

69
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,588
they came into the theater
  ought to know,

70
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,722
it's...

(SCREAMING)

72
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,029
Of course,
  it was Boris and Natasha,

73
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,099
who at this moment, were
  somewhere in a remote part
  of the Middle East.

74
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:56,402
Boris. Boris, darling.

75
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,938
Where is egg?

76
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:02,809
Egg, egg.
  Where is egg?

79
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,714
from a potentate's palace.

80

 So back in Pottsylvania and
 with their mission completed,

00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,257
Boris and Natasha suddenly
  received an urgent summons

from their beloved
  Fearless Leader.

Yes, even they could tell
  something very important

was about to happen.

129
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,769
Fearless Leader,
 we are honored.

We are so honored.
  Good.

Therefore,
  your orders are these.

  must pose as defectors.

From the moment
  you leave this room,

142
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,274
your every action
  must be consistent

with that of a traitor.

Once you arrive
 in America,

you must convince

that you are sincere.

523
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,283
What kind of potato was it?
 I don't know.

524
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:46,317
Idaho.

525
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,087
Listen, Mike,

526
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,356
tell Willie I want him to
 double his surveillance.

527
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,858
No, quadruple it.
 You got it?

528
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,231
BORIS:
  God damn Kalishak,
  he knew something,

529
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:04,169
he just wasn't talking.
  He called me your flunky.

530
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:05,570
Forget about it,
  he is an idiot.

531
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,605
Here, hang up my coat.

532
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,509
I know what I should do.

533
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:14,746
I should force-feed him
 woodchips for an entire year.

534
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,049
And then I will bury him
  in the ground up to his neck

535
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:19,651
in a termite mound

536
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,953
and watch them devour
  him as he screams for mercy.

537
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,489
Very good.

538
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:26,624
Search your soul
  for the answer.

539
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,827
What the hell
is his problem, anyway?

540
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,996
NARRATOR:
  Next morning, Boris
  and Natasha begin the day

541
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,331
with a typical
 American breakfast.

542
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,680

(SCREAMS)

544
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,987
NARRATOR:
So they searched Boris's
sole and got their clue.

545
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,789
And wearing one of their
  many brilliant disguises,

546
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,557
they soon found
  themselves outside

547
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:02,227
the most fashionable
hair salon in the city.

548
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:09,667
WOMAN:
  I can't do my hair again.

549
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,970
Because, I think all the
chemicals have leaked
into my brain.

550
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:14,939
I'm so spaced,
 I can hardly answer the phone.

551
00:31:14,973 --> 00:31:16,908
Hold on a minute,
 will you?

552
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,376
Permit me to
 introduce myself.

553
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,745
I am Steve Shag
  and this is Ansel Fiber.

554
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:23,014
We are here
  to clean the rugs.

WOMAN:
 Excuse me,
 but all our floors are tiled.

556
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,621
I think you guys
  have the wrong address, heh.

557
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,890
No, we don't.
 Boris, show.

558
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:38,129
Manelli. Oh, you're not here
  to clean the rugs,

559
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:39,964
you're here to
change the photos.

560
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,634
You're working
  for Sal Manelli,
  the photographer, right?

561
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:45,403
Yes. He's the one.
  We came to meet him.

562
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,439
Meet Manelli? Look, we just
buy his photographs,

563
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,008
he doesn't actually
  work here.

564
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:54,112
Tash? Boris.

565
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:58,549
Ooh. Acme Rugs.
 What are you guys doing here?

566
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,120
Uh, we are,
 we came, to uh...

567
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:04,856
To say hello.

568
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,792
Oh. How did you
 know I worked here?

569
00:32:07,825 --> 00:32:10,261
We didn't.
  Boris, big joke.

NARRATOR:
 Yes, there he was,
 Jose Eber, himself.

573
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,202
World-famous
 connoisseur of beauty.

574
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,737
A man who, with one
wave of his blow dryer,

575
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,239
could make you a star.

576
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,677
And with one look at that
  Pottsylvanian profile,

577
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,178
he was completely
  enchanted.

578
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,846
Oh, my God.

579
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,284
NARRATOR:
 Well, before she knew
 what hit her,

580
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:35,920
Jose promised he could make
 her an overnight sensation.

581
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:38,923
He would introduce her to
 every major fashion
 photographer in the country,

582
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:40,625
starting with an enormous
  party in her honor

583
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:42,327
at the elegant private club,
 Chez Monyou,

584
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,095
that Friday night.

585
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:46,531
Well, Boris saw this as
the perfect opportunity.

586
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,166
They could use the party
to find Manelli,

587
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,668
who would lead them straight
 to the Professor.

588
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:52,203
So while waiting
for Friday,

589
00:32:52,236 --> 00:32:54,572
they did what any other
  American would have done,

590
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,174
they went shopping.

♪ All the boys

  And of course, no American
  mall would be complete

596
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:16,694
without Aunt Fanny's
 fine cutlery

597
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:18,329
and automatic weapons shop.

598
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,601
No.

599
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,206
No.

600
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,421
No.

601
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,655
NARRATOR:
 And so,
 as they left the mall,

602
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,991
Natasha was already beginning
 to feel the allure

603
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:49,160
of the American
way of life.

604
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,928
So the very next day,
 she did something

605
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,897
she had never done before.

00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,469
I should not be go
 here with you.

608

What are you talking about?

609
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,206
You gotta get something
 to wear to the party.

610
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,908
Boris say
  what I have is good.

611
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:06,577
Forget about what
 Boris says, come on.

612
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:12,316
So don't you feel
 better?

613
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,951
This is the way Harve
 and I do it.

614
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,887
I never have to tell him
 what I buy.

615
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,189
He does what he wants,
 I do what I want.

616
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,324
You know, Tash, if
 a relationship is gonna work,

617
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,628
it's gotta be equal.
 Fifty-fifty. You did good.

618
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,439
Hey.
 Get me my tie.

619
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,642
Stop looking in the mirror
 all the time.

620
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,684
You look great.
You really like it?

621
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,886
Sure. Americans love
hokey getups.

622
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,022
Okay, let's review
  the plan.

We go to the party, we find
  the guy with the camera.

626
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,031
I give him the password.

627
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:02,533
If he answers,
  we know it's Manelli.

628
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:05,369
He leads us right
  to the Professor.

629
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,140
And if anything
goes wrong...

630
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:12,176
We kill ourselves.

NARRATOR:
 Well, Boris's plan was
 brilliant, as usual.

633
00:35:19,383 --> 00:35:20,852
Natasha would provide
 a distraction

634
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,019
while he looked
for Manelli,

635
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,821
who would obviously be
 a man with a camera.

NARRATOR:
 Of course, Boris' plan
 was an utter disaster,

644
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,453
but as a diversion, Natasha
 was an instant success.

645
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,623
She had such flair,
 such charm, such an
 incredible haircut,

646
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,625
that soon she went right to
 the top of the fashion world.

647
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,594
And a veritable Natasha
mania swept the country.

648

  of the sultry spy.

Yes, everywhere, people
were imitating her
inimitable style.

Especially
 that snappy hairdo.

653
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,442
Of course, Natasha herself
  had gotten the idea

654
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:21,812
from one of Pottsylvania's
  national heroes.

655
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,215
But in any event, soon there
 wasn't a corner of the world

of getting famous

 on a lot of people.

The spying had come
 to a halt.

  to watch.

 had no one to follow.

The CIA had no one
  to listen to.

663

There was still
 no sign of Manelli,

664

00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:54,972
Oh, Boris, so typical.

694
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:58,909
This America,
  you are not my boss.

695
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,179
You are not my husband.
 You are not even...

696
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:04,749
Never mind.
  What?

697
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:05,950
What am I not even?
What?

698
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,352
Oh, you are so stupid
  sometime, Boris.

699
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:12,123
If relationship is to be
  lasting, must be equal.

700
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,825
Oh.
 So for first time in my life,

701
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,594
I am doing
  what I want to do.

702
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,063
And do you know what?
  I am liking it.

703
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,432
Toots is behind this, isn't
she? Toots, Toots, Toots.

704
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:24,135
Toots happens to be
 wonderful person.

705
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:25,670
And don't think you're
so smart,

706
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,338
because she know about you.

707
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:30,274
She know exactly
  how you feel about...

708
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:32,076
And how far
do you think you get

709
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:33,711
if it was not for me
  after all these years?

710
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,247
I do everything.
 I do work

711
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,683
and you never...
  You never...

712
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,485
Never what?
  You never say thank you.

713
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,055
What the hell?

714
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:48,159
So I am hoping that
from this day forward,

715
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:52,063
that you will be liking
  to carry your own luggage.

716
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,702

718
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,311

  was about luggage?

 Well, Boris had hit
 rock bottom.

720

Even the simplest of pleasures
could not cheer him up.

721
00:39:35,372 --> 00:39:37,875
And, as he wandered through
 the silent streets,

722
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,377
he wondered, could Natasha
  have been right?

723
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,913
Could she have, in some
  small, insignificant way

724
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,649
been responsible for
  their illustrious career?

725
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,118
Could he actually
  have been

726
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,887
just the tiniest bit
 insensitive for, say,

727
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,856

00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:31,382
I've seen your photographs.

I'm a friend of
  Dr. Paulovitch.

745
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,019
I helped him to escape
the lab.

746

  Yes, good, what is it?

Does an Anton Paulovitch
  strike a bell with you?

755
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:07,451
No, I can't say
  I ever heard of him.

756
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:12,089
Noon, huh?
  Okay, thanks.

757
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:14,625
And listen, Dan,
 keep up the good work.

758
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:26,136
I will look terrible
 in photos.

759
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,905
I did not get
 very much sleep.

760
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,874
Don't worry about it.
 Look, about last night...

761
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,579
Uh, let's talk
about it later.

762
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,581
Yes, Boris.

763
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,750
You go to this place
and you meet Manelli.

764
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:42,353
You get the information from
  him. I will be there too.

765
00:43:42,386 --> 00:43:44,221
But I'm going to be
 disguised, okay?

766
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,490
I am loving
 when you wear disguise.

767

You make sure you get
 the information from him.

If he gives you
any trouble,

769

But meanwhile,
  back at our story,

776
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,619
the elusive Manelli had
finally surfaced.

777
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,754
And as luck would have it,

778
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:19,223
he too,
was another master spy.

779
00:44:19,256 --> 00:44:21,492
Yes, it seemed that
  Natasha's sudden notoriety

780
00:44:21,525 --> 00:44:23,327
actually served a purpose,
  after all.

  Boris Badanov

786

  into the crowd.

Unfortunately, he got in line
 with the Village People.

 it in the teeth.

 what is this? I said $1.

  Figure you'd be
  looking for him.

How come you checked
  in here?

1057

Don't you already have
 an apartment?

 you can't come in,

1062
01:00:38,334 --> 01:00:42,271
but, uh, we are having some
 problem with our relationship,

1063
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:45,908
and Mr. Willie Onopolous
 is our marriage counselor.

1064
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:47,443
Doesn't look like
he'd be much help.

1065

Oh, no, not now,
 but when he come to,

1066
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:52,348
he is like,
 uh, he can, Boris...

Uh, it's a new technique.

1068

  incapacitated himself,

  a mutual responsibility.

  it helps us.

 than $70 an hour,

 off, pal.

He probably took it
  with him. Damn.

At least we know
 why he was here.

Yes. Why?

1084
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:33,122
First he killed Willie,

1085

and then he come back
 for train schedule.

  Yes.
