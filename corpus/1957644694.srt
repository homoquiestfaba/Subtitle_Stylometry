1
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:27,366
( footsteps )

2
00:00:45,687 --> 00:00:48,690
( lock clicking )

3
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:00,303
Fall in and catch it.

4
00:01:00,303 --> 00:01:02,373
Rise up and let the wind take

5
00:01:02,373 --> 00:01:07,111
you there.

6
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:09,248
Put your head down and keep it

7
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:11,717
down, girl.

8
00:01:11,717 --> 00:01:16,790
Arms. More arm.

9
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:18,158
See what happens when you listen

10
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:20,061
to me?

11
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:23,731
Reach down and grab the victory.

12
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:24,832
Feel the power, Gail.

13
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:26,168
Inside and out.

14
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:29,771
Drive. Pull.

15
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:33,776
Speed merchant.

16
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:36,179
That's what you are.

17
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,747
They can't catch you, Devers.

18
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:40,784
Unless you want to be caught.

19
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:56,870
Get going, girl.

20
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:43,557
( gunshot, cheering )

21
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:01,913
Come on. Come on, now.

22
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,311
Yes!

23
00:03:45,063 --> 00:03:48,366
( reporters clamoring )

24
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:51,437
The winner of the women's

25
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:55,207
100 meter hurdles, Gail Devers,

26
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:58,545
with a time of 12.68 seconds!

27
00:03:58,545 --> 00:04:02,650
A new national record!

28
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,685
( cheering )

29
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:25,075
I won! Did you see me?

30
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:27,045
I saw it.

31
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:29,047
I set a record.

32
00:04:29,047 --> 00:04:29,714
Barely.

33
00:04:29,714 --> 00:04:31,716
Had a long takeoff, short

34
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:33,419
touchdown, head way up in the

35
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,421
clouds somewhere.

36
00:04:35,421 --> 00:04:37,023
Bobby, I won today.

37
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:38,025
So did 100 other girls

38
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:39,059
in 100 other places.

39
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:40,127
And if you don't stay on it,

40
00:04:40,127 --> 00:04:40,961
the Games, they're gonna slip

41
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:43,030
right through your fingers.

42
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,332
Keep trying to tell you,

43
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:46,000
you ain't gonna listen.

44
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,106
Okay, I'll practice my

45
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:52,608
takeoffs and work on my

46
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:54,276
touchdowns.

47
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:58,148
Hey, G. Congratulations.

48
00:04:58,148 --> 00:05:00,984
You won today.

49
00:05:04,622 --> 00:05:07,725
( bells chime )

50
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:18,204
Gail.

51
00:05:18,204 --> 00:05:19,105
Hey, ma.

52
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:19,605
I can't believe it.

53
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:21,008
This is my day.

54
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:22,076
Come on, your Daddy's waiting

55
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:25,679
for you.

56
00:05:29,117 --> 00:05:30,051
You were supposed to be here

57
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:30,785
30 minutes ago.

58
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:31,721
I know that.

59
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:33,622
How do you do?

60
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:34,523
Where were you?

61
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:36,258
The caterer was late.

62
00:05:36,258 --> 00:05:38,328
I got the wrong caterer.

63
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:39,763
I'll never use him again.

64
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:40,697
Hello.

65
00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:42,032
How do you do?

66
00:05:42,032 --> 00:05:42,666
Thank you for coming.

67
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,533
Everything's okay, don't make

68
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:45,536
a fuss.

69
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:49,173
Don't you look nice.

70
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:51,510
Yes, okay.

71
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,745
Why do we always get nervous?

72
00:05:52,745 --> 00:05:53,612
I don't understand.

73
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:55,114
I don't remember.

74
00:05:55,114 --> 00:05:56,149
It's been so long since your

75
00:05:56,149 --> 00:05:58,184
uncle and I got married, but--

76
00:05:58,184 --> 00:06:00,420
One more.

77
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,390
Wow.

78
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,258
Is that the last one?

79
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:05,126
Just ten more.

80
00:06:05,126 --> 00:06:06,093
Oh, no, no.

81
00:06:06,093 --> 00:06:07,194
We have to get her ready.

82
00:06:07,194 --> 00:06:08,330
Who's cousin are you?

83
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,231
I'm, um--

84
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:10,232
This is R.J.'s second

85
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:10,832
cousin.

86
00:06:10,832 --> 00:06:13,135
Well, uh, yes.

87
00:06:13,135 --> 00:06:14,837
Glad to-- glad to meet you.

88
00:06:14,837 --> 00:06:17,206
But let's get her ready.

89
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:17,840
We'll see you outside.

90
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,641
Oh, okay.

91
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:21,078
Um, one more.

92
00:06:21,078 --> 00:06:22,780
Coach Kersee, so glad to see

93
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,148
you.

94
00:06:24,148 --> 00:06:25,315
You too, Reverend Devers.

95
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:26,484
Gail will be pretty.

96
00:06:26,484 --> 00:06:27,585
Thrilled I'm not gonna make

97
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:30,255
her run today.

98
00:06:30,255 --> 00:06:31,757
Thank the Lord I only have to

99
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:33,259
do this once.

100
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:39,099
What do you think?

101
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:40,467
Well, I think they might just

102
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:41,435
make it.

103
00:06:41,435 --> 00:06:42,436
I'm getting a front row seat and

104
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:43,403
watch the festivities.

105
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,238
Okay.

106
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,239
Good luck to you, sir.

107
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,474
Okay, see you at the

108
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:47,542
reception.

109
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:49,444
Gail, what is--

110
00:06:49,444 --> 00:06:51,413
Something's wrong.

111
00:06:51,413 --> 00:06:53,248
I'm gonna have to take a tuck

112
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:53,882
in this.

113
00:06:53,882 --> 00:06:55,451
On, no, Mom, we can't take

114
00:06:55,451 --> 00:06:56,286
a tuck in this--

115
00:06:56,286 --> 00:06:57,654
This fit you perfectly a week

116
00:06:57,654 --> 00:06:58,354
ago.

117
00:06:58,354 --> 00:06:59,222
How could you lose--?

118
00:06:59,222 --> 00:07:00,824
My body's always changing.

119
00:07:00,824 --> 00:07:01,859
How could you lose so much

120
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:03,427
weight in one week?

121
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:06,630
Come on, Mema, it's okay.

122
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,233
Nobody's gonna notice but you.

123
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:09,301
I know.

124
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:10,469
Get your granny's diamond

125
00:07:10,469 --> 00:07:12,270
earrings over on the table.

126
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,739
Careful.

127
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:15,808
Congressman, how are you?

128
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:19,813
So nice to see you.

129
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:23,417
No. You are not gonna do this

130
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:24,651
again.

131
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,187
Not again.

132
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:27,322
Can't help it.

133
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,892
I'm so happy today, Mema.

134
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:32,161
Hope it stays that way

135
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:33,162
forever.

136
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:35,764
Kid, you deserve it.

137
00:07:35,764 --> 00:07:39,202
( choir member sings )

138
00:07:39,202 --> 00:07:41,171
We are gathered here today

139
00:07:41,171 --> 00:07:43,941
to join this man and this

140
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:46,310
woman in the holy state of

141
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,179
matrimony.

142
00:07:48,179 --> 00:07:49,915
It is a solemn moment and one

143
00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:54,286
not to be entered into lightly.

144
00:07:57,524 --> 00:07:59,893
You may now kiss the bride.

145
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:03,230
( applause )

146
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:31,563
( light jazz music )

147
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:32,798
You stepped on my foot,

148
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:33,766
Robert.

149
00:08:33,766 --> 00:08:34,667
Get your foot out the way,

150
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:35,568
Jackie.

151
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:36,569
Sure you know how to do that,

152
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:37,303
don't you?

153
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:39,005
You used to be able to dance.

154
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:40,373
Oh, I'm just waiting for my

155
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:41,575
song.

156
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:42,976
I do. Come on.

157
00:08:42,976 --> 00:08:44,412
Let's go visit Jackie and

158
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:47,615
Robert.

159
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,349
Hey!

160
00:08:48,349 --> 00:08:49,417
Congratulations.

161
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:50,252
Hey, you.

162
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:54,423
Baby girl.

163
00:08:54,423 --> 00:08:56,259
Congratulations.

164
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:57,894
Here I go again.

165
00:08:57,894 --> 00:08:58,795
Hey, man.

166
00:08:58,795 --> 00:08:59,762
I didn't know you owned a pair

167
00:08:59,762 --> 00:09:00,897
of hard shoes, Coach.

168
00:09:00,897 --> 00:09:01,899
I like to get off the track

169
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:02,933
from time to time.

170
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:04,301
You got a suit too.

171
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:06,337
Yeah. Come together.

172
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,404
You all leave my handsome

173
00:09:07,404 --> 00:09:08,306
husband alone.

174
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:11,009
You heard that, huh?

175
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,348
Shall we dance?

176
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:18,551
Ooh, stop it, Bobby, behave.

177
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:22,923
( wine glass rings )

178
00:09:22,923 --> 00:09:25,492
First of all, on behalf of

179
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:28,329
Mr. and Mrs. Hampton, my wife

180
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:30,365
and myself, I want to thank

181
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:32,668
each and every one of you

182
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:34,637
for coming.

183
00:09:34,637 --> 00:09:36,071
I think it's about time that we

184
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:37,874
let these young people go and

185
00:09:37,874 --> 00:09:39,709
begin their married life.

186
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:41,745
But before they do, I want to

187
00:09:41,745 --> 00:09:43,380
say a few words, because that's

188
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,316
what ministers do and I paid

189
00:09:45,316 --> 00:09:46,651
for the wedding.

190
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:50,589
( laughter )

191
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,024
You've got to know that this

192
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,725
is one of the happiest moments

193
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:54,559
in my life.

194
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,463
We've all seen Gail grow up

195
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,433
in this church family.

196
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,403
And we've seen her grow into a

197
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:04,338
champion runner blessed with

198
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:05,739
divine power.

199
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:10,478
R.J., her husband, is a fine

200
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:12,947
athlete in his own right.

201
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,117
He's not as fast as Gail, but

202
00:10:15,117 --> 00:10:17,453
then again he is.

203
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:20,524
( laughter )

204
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:27,065
But at least, R.J., you don't

205
00:10:27,065 --> 00:10:27,899
have to bring her in by 12:00

206
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,434
anymore.

207
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:32,604
Thank you.

208
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:35,374
But seriously, R.J., I can't

209
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:37,577
think of a better husband for

210
00:10:37,577 --> 00:10:39,746
my daughter, or a finer

211
00:10:39,746 --> 00:10:45,052
son-in-law.

212
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:49,423
Gail, R.J.,

213
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:52,561
to you Gail, and to you, R.J.,

214
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:55,732
I'd like to wish you both

215
00:10:55,732 --> 00:10:59,769
God's blessing, God's grace,

216
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:02,873
and above all, Godspeed.

217
00:11:02,873 --> 00:11:05,642
Godspeed.

218
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:07,512
Godspeed.

219
00:11:07,512 --> 00:11:09,514
Godspeed.

220
00:11:13,652 --> 00:11:16,655
( gulls calling )

221
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:29,437
Come on, Gail!

222
00:11:29,437 --> 00:11:30,738
I thought you said this was

223
00:11:30,738 --> 00:11:32,741
gonna be the last mile!

224
00:11:32,741 --> 00:11:34,576
Catch up, R.J.!

225
00:11:34,576 --> 00:11:36,044
All right, now.

226
00:11:36,044 --> 00:11:37,881
Don't think I can't catch you.

227
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:39,716
Where are we going?

228
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:40,617
Where you going?

229
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,651
Come on, now.

230
00:11:41,651 --> 00:11:42,519
Come on!

231
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,188
I got you! I got you now!

232
00:11:44,188 --> 00:11:47,792
I'm coming! ( roars )

233
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:49,895
( both laugh )

234
00:11:49,895 --> 00:11:52,531
Thought you'd get away, huh?

235
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:54,633
( laughs )

236
00:11:54,633 --> 00:11:57,603
You want some fun, don't you?

237
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,483
I'm hungry.

238
00:12:08,483 --> 00:12:09,484
Let's get some breakfast.

239
00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:12,053
No. I'm not ready to eat yet.

240
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:18,561
'Cause, uh, there's nobody

241
00:12:18,561 --> 00:12:22,966
here but you and me.

242
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:36,515
Come on, R.J.

243
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:38,084
Let's run.

244
00:12:38,084 --> 00:12:38,985
Run?

245
00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:39,919
I only have two more miles to

246
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:40,620
go.

247
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,654
It's my honeymoon.

248
00:12:41,654 --> 00:12:42,856
Just two more miles.

249
00:12:42,856 --> 00:12:43,958
I promise I'll be back before

250
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,993
you get out of the shower.

251
00:12:45,993 --> 00:12:47,695
I'm going back, Gail.

252
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:49,564
I'm going back now.

253
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:51,800
I'm going-- Gail? For real.

254
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,003
Keep that water running!

255
00:12:55,003 --> 00:12:59,008
I'm leaving now, Gail.

256
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,633
( R&B Pop music )

257
00:13:39,088 --> 00:13:40,690
Honey, this is beautiful.

258
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,791
Careful, now.

259
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:42,992
I just got you, I don't wanna

260
00:13:42,992 --> 00:13:44,028
lose you.

261
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:45,896
You're not gonna lose me.

262
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:52,737
Know what? Let's buy a house.

263
00:13:52,737 --> 00:13:54,973
I mean a big house.

264
00:13:54,973 --> 00:13:57,143
Yeah, with lots of rooms.

265
00:13:57,143 --> 00:13:58,811
And a garden full of flowers.

266
00:13:58,811 --> 00:13:59,879
And a fireplace.

267
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:01,748
Yeah, and a dog.

268
00:14:01,748 --> 00:14:03,250
Oh, gots to have a dog.

269
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,285
Look after you, the kids when

270
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:06,887
I'm not at home.

271
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,256
So I don't have to worry about

272
00:14:08,256 --> 00:14:10,124
my little family.

273
00:14:23,073 --> 00:14:27,211
( starter gun fires )

274
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:48,402
I think I made it.

275
00:14:48,402 --> 00:14:49,771
I wasn't supposed to win, I was

276
00:14:49,771 --> 00:14:50,872
supposed to qualify.

277
00:14:50,872 --> 00:14:52,774
Qualifying for the U.S. team,

278
00:14:52,774 --> 00:14:55,711
and the Games in Seoul are

279
00:14:55,711 --> 00:15:00,416
Kisha McCantz, Shannon Woods

280
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:03,754
and Gail Devers!

281
00:15:03,754 --> 00:15:04,788
That's the point.

282
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:05,722
I just had to qualify.

283
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:08,960
( indistinct dialogue )

284
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:22,709
( pants )

285
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:51,509
( whistle )

286
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:55,146
Dammit!

287
00:15:55,146 --> 00:15:57,216
Gail, what're you doing?

288
00:15:57,216 --> 00:15:58,417
Nothing, I'm fine.

289
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:01,187
Look, this race takes fifty

290
00:16:01,187 --> 00:16:03,123
strides, no more, no less.

291
00:16:03,123 --> 00:16:03,690
You're four more better than

292
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,791
fine.

293
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:05,792
Just a little tired, that's

294
00:16:05,792 --> 00:16:06,159
all.

295
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,996
Tired?

296
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:13,836
Tired as in, uh, you got too

297
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:15,404
much sleep, or tired as in,

298
00:16:15,404 --> 00:16:17,906
you didn't get enough?

299
00:16:17,906 --> 00:16:19,174
I got just the right amount.

300
00:16:19,174 --> 00:16:20,777
Just got the right amount?

301
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:21,411
Mmm-hmm.

302
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:23,847
Mmm-hmm.

303
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:30,855
Hey, what do you see?

304
00:16:30,855 --> 00:16:31,990
Where?

305
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,924
Down there.

306
00:16:32,924 --> 00:16:34,793
Tell me what you see.

307
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:35,961
A lane.

308
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,463
Past that.

309
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,098
A wall.

310
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:39,899
Past that.

311
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,000
I can't see past the wall.

312
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,135
Right.

313
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:45,839
Can't see past the wall.

314
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,174
You wanna win the gold?

315
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:47,908
Yeah--

316
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:50,345
Do you want to win the gold?

317
00:16:50,345 --> 00:16:53,248
Yeah, I wanna win the gold.

318
00:16:53,248 --> 00:16:55,818
See, what you don't know

319
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:58,354
is you already got it.

320
00:16:58,354 --> 00:16:59,855
It's out there waiting for you

321
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:00,923
to claim it.

322
00:17:00,923 --> 00:17:03,059
You got to use your mind and

323
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:05,028
your heart.

324
00:17:05,028 --> 00:17:07,265
Got to imagine yourself already

325
00:17:07,265 --> 00:17:08,833
winning that race.

326
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,001
Imagine yourself crossing that

327
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:11,836
finish line.

328
00:17:11,836 --> 00:17:16,842
First. Huh?

329
00:17:16,842 --> 00:17:18,343
Retrace the steps that got you

330
00:17:18,343 --> 00:17:19,979
there backwards.

331
00:17:19,979 --> 00:17:21,948
So you end up right here, right

332
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:25,152
now.

333
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:26,220
But--

334
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,855
I don't want to hear it.

335
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:28,989
Two 100 meter repeats.

336
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:29,857
Chop chop. Right now.

337
00:17:29,857 --> 00:17:33,295
Right now.

338
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:38,868
Gail, shy do you take that

339
00:17:38,868 --> 00:17:40,002
shit from him?

340
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:40,970
Same reason everybody else

341
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,572
does.

342
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:44,541
He's the best track coach in the

343
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,309
world.

344
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:46,176
Says him.

345
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:47,444
Says everybody.

346
00:17:47,444 --> 00:17:49,147
I don't wanna talk about Kersey

347
00:17:49,147 --> 00:17:50,348
anymore tonight.

348
00:17:50,348 --> 00:17:51,916
I just wanna go to sleep.

349
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:53,618
My head is killing me.

350
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:58,057
Mama, what you got on?

351
00:17:58,057 --> 00:18:01,461
Mmm. What you doing now?

352
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:03,530
Oh, my eye hurts.

353
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,898
Mmm, here.

354
00:18:04,898 --> 00:18:05,999
I'm gonna kiss it and make

355
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:10,338
it better.

356
00:18:10,338 --> 00:18:15,077
Mmm, you smell good. Oh.

357
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:16,378
R.J.

358
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:17,980
Mmm-hmm.

359
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:25,589
Where you goin'? Huh?

360
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:29,260
R.J.

361
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,995
What do you see?

362
00:18:30,995 --> 00:18:31,529
What?

363
00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:33,965
There. What do you see?

364
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:35,367
R.J. I'm too tired--

365
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:37,336
Oh, see, you're not looking.

366
00:18:37,336 --> 00:18:38,938
But I am.

367
00:18:38,938 --> 00:18:41,007
I don't just see a bed with some

368
00:18:41,007 --> 00:18:42,074
sheets and pillows.

369
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:42,508
Oh, no.

370
00:18:42,508 --> 00:18:44,444
Well, what do you see?

371
00:18:44,444 --> 00:18:46,079
What you've got to see.

372
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,714
To the other side of that bed.

373
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:49,951
Past those sheets and pillows.

374
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:52,353
See, you gotta see your

375
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:57,393
fulfillment, already there.

376
00:18:57,393 --> 00:19:00,529
Sexual ecstasy.

377
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:04,334
Just waiting to be claimed.

378
00:19:04,334 --> 00:19:06,036
I'm not sure I wanna claim

379
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:07,138
it.

380
00:19:07,138 --> 00:19:09,006
But you got to.

381
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:10,474
It's already there.

382
00:19:10,474 --> 00:19:13,478
Gotta see it backwards.

383
00:19:13,478 --> 00:19:15,314
See yourself.

384
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:04,037
Gail? I was thinking--

385
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,372
thinking about getting cable

386
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,206
hooked up.

387
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,174
What do you think?

388
00:20:07,174 --> 00:20:11,412
Sure, yeah.

389
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,191
Don't forget to call that rep

390
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:24,160
for All Sports Endorsements.

391
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,662
He sounded serious.

392
00:20:25,662 --> 00:20:28,065
Called me three times.

393
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:29,400
You hear me, baby?

394
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,406
Yeah. I heard you.

395
00:20:34,406 --> 00:20:37,243
Can you bring me a towel?

396
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:40,112
Yeah.

397
00:20:40,112 --> 00:20:41,747
Here you go.

398
00:21:36,644 --> 00:21:38,380
We can be out here all night

399
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,549
if you wanna--

400
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,184
You wanna start moving these

401
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:46,156
numbers in the right direction?

402
00:21:46,156 --> 00:21:47,324
Huh?

403
00:21:47,324 --> 00:21:49,260
I don't know.

404
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,364
Is it fear, Devers?

405
00:21:53,364 --> 00:21:54,832
'Cause fear is not real, you

406
00:21:54,832 --> 00:21:56,235
know, just an excuse to keep

407
00:21:56,235 --> 00:21:57,336
you from doing the work that you

408
00:21:57,336 --> 00:21:58,237
ought to be doing!

409
00:21:58,237 --> 00:21:59,304
I'm not trying to get--

410
00:21:59,304 --> 00:22:01,241
No, you're not!

411
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:07,915
I'm gonna hit the showers.

412
00:22:07,915 --> 00:22:10,718
Hey, Devers.

413
00:22:10,718 --> 00:22:12,686
Think Europeans are hitting the

414
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:15,257
showers? Huh?

415
00:22:15,257 --> 00:22:18,660
( distant thunder )

416
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:43,456
( gasps )

417
00:22:50,898 --> 00:22:53,467
( groans )

418
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:39,922
( crowd cheering )

419
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:42,791
Go, R.J.!

420
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:46,329
Come on!

421
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,768
Qualifying for the U.S. Team

422
00:23:50,768 --> 00:23:52,637
in Seoul in the Men's 400 Meter

423
00:23:52,637 --> 00:23:54,372
are, George Chapall,

424
00:23:54,372 --> 00:23:55,340
Michael Meadows

425
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,842
and Steve Heinke.

426
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:15,030
This can't be.

427
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,464
What's happening?

428
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:21,437
Oh, hey, girl.

429
00:24:21,437 --> 00:24:22,438
Hey, Jackie.

430
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:23,406
You're trying to beat the

431
00:24:23,406 --> 00:24:24,106
line too, huh?

432
00:24:24,106 --> 00:24:25,409
Yeah, I gotta get out of

433
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:26,743
here.

434
00:24:26,743 --> 00:24:28,412
Somebody's been doing too

435
00:24:28,412 --> 00:24:29,079
much honeymooning.

436
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:31,582
Yeah, it's R.J.'s cooking.

437
00:24:31,582 --> 00:24:33,718
I wouldn't say that to Bobby.

438
00:24:33,718 --> 00:24:35,486
You know that's right.

439
00:24:42,762 --> 00:24:45,098
What?

440
00:24:45,098 --> 00:24:47,434
You're not pregnant, are you?

441
00:24:47,434 --> 00:24:50,104
No, I'm not pregnant.

442
00:24:50,104 --> 00:24:52,006
I just weighed in with my flats

443
00:24:52,006 --> 00:24:53,541
on, that's all.

444
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:55,510
I know what can happen on a

445
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:56,445
honeymoon.

446
00:24:56,445 --> 00:24:58,547
Well, it didn't.

447
00:24:58,547 --> 00:25:00,449
Of course, when I think about

448
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:02,151
it, when Bobby and I first

449
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:03,653
got married, the next time

450
00:25:03,653 --> 00:25:05,455
I looked up, I was carrying five

451
00:25:05,455 --> 00:25:06,857
pounds of somebody else's boot

452
00:25:06,857 --> 00:25:08,459
in my body.

453
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:09,493
And I know he had something

454
00:25:09,493 --> 00:25:09,927
to say about it too.

455
00:25:09,927 --> 00:25:13,698
Get up out the chair.

456
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:14,833
You're just in time.

457
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:15,467
Team weigh in.

458
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:16,534
Stand in line there.

459
00:25:16,534 --> 00:25:18,136
No, I gotta go.

460
00:25:18,136 --> 00:25:23,509
Sorry I can't stay, Dr. Otis.

461
00:25:23,509 --> 00:25:27,547
( door closes )

462
00:25:27,547 --> 00:25:28,982
R.J.?

463
00:25:28,982 --> 00:25:30,550
Yeah?

464
00:25:40,863 --> 00:25:42,899
Hi, baby.

465
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:44,701
When did you get home?

466
00:25:44,701 --> 00:25:48,806
Three hours ago.

467
00:25:48,806 --> 00:25:53,844
Practice ran long today.

468
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,680
I had to stop at the store.

469
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,115
Got home as soon as I could.

470
00:25:57,115 --> 00:26:01,754
How was your meeting?

471
00:26:01,754 --> 00:26:05,892
My job stinks, Gail.

472
00:26:05,892 --> 00:26:08,629
I wanted to come home and tell

473
00:26:08,629 --> 00:26:10,097
you about it, I even hoped that

474
00:26:10,097 --> 00:26:11,165
maybe you might've even had

475
00:26:11,165 --> 00:26:12,199
dinner ready for me.

476
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:14,636
Imagine that.

477
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:15,870
Well, I'm making dinner for

478
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,671
you right now.

479
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:21,510
I've already eaten.

480
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,012
Towels.

481
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:27,250
Three hours.

482
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,985
Three hours, Gail.

483
00:26:28,985 --> 00:26:30,554
I told you practice ran long

484
00:26:30,554 --> 00:26:30,988
tonight.

485
00:26:30,988 --> 00:26:32,123
You don't have to run every

486
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:33,591
second of every day!

487
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,525
You're certainly living proof

488
00:26:34,525 --> 00:26:35,860
of that.

489
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:44,737
I'm going out.

490
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:47,740
I don't need this shit.

491
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:05,995
I don't need this.

492
00:27:58,657 --> 00:28:00,960
I'll be back on the 27th.

493
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,128
How am I supposed to reach

494
00:28:02,128 --> 00:28:03,629
you in Korea?

495
00:28:03,629 --> 00:28:05,031
There's a phone number on

496
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:06,700
the refrigerator.

497
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,803
Just in case.

498
00:28:11,772 --> 00:28:12,907
They d=said it's gonna be warm

499
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:13,908
over there, so I'm not gonna

500
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:15,076
take a lot of stuff.

501
00:28:15,076 --> 00:28:17,045
Oh, do you know where my red

502
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:18,279
sweatshirt is?

503
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,748
Uh, clothes hamper last time

504
00:28:19,748 --> 00:28:20,950
I saw it.

505
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,188
( phone rings )

506
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:31,228
Hello?

507
00:28:31,228 --> 00:28:33,698
Hi, Mema.

508
00:28:33,698 --> 00:28:34,799
It'll take you about an hour to

509
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:35,399
get here.

510
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:37,803
I'll be ready for sure by then.

511
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:39,671
Hold on.

512
00:28:39,671 --> 00:28:40,939
Baby, I gotta go.

513
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:48,348
Have a good time.

514
00:28:50,851 --> 00:28:53,821
I'll call you, R.J.

515
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:55,056
( door slams )

516
00:28:55,056 --> 00:28:58,860
( engines roar )

517
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:18,951
( crowd cheering )

518
00:29:18,951 --> 00:29:22,287
( announcer speaks Korean )

519
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:25,759
Ladies and gentlemen,

520
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:27,293
this is the first qualifying

521
00:29:27,293 --> 00:29:28,995
heat for the women's 100 meter

522
00:29:28,995 --> 00:29:30,865
hurdles.

523
00:29:34,869 --> 00:29:39,941
( announcer speaks Korean )

524
00:29:47,316 --> 00:29:49,186
( starter gunshot, cheering )

525
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:03,903
( announcer speaks Korean )

526
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:20,222
Gail, you okay?

527
00:30:20,222 --> 00:30:21,790
Jackie, something's wrong

528
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,424
with me.

529
00:30:22,424 --> 00:30:24,928
What's wrong?

530
00:30:24,928 --> 00:30:26,830
I'm going home, Bobby.

531
00:30:31,268 --> 00:30:34,138
Is this the right position?

532
00:30:39,511 --> 00:30:41,880
Are all the test results in?

533
00:30:45,852 --> 00:30:47,453
Well, what could it be?

534
00:30:51,091 --> 00:30:52,426
We want an answer.

535
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:02,271
It's nothing.

536
00:31:02,271 --> 00:31:04,440
We can't find a thing.

537
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,142
Look, the x-rays are clear.

538
00:31:06,142 --> 00:31:06,977
And that's all you can tell

539
00:31:06,977 --> 00:31:07,978
us?

540
00:31:07,978 --> 00:31:10,914
Here, see for yourself.

541
00:31:10,914 --> 00:31:14,152
( machine clicks )

542
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:16,888
It's probably just stress.

543
00:31:16,888 --> 00:31:18,924
Doctor, my daughter is an

544
00:31:18,924 --> 00:31:19,825
athlete.

545
00:31:19,825 --> 00:31:21,527
She's a fine tuned machine.

546
00:31:21,527 --> 00:31:22,928
She knows when there's something

547
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:24,296
wrong, and so do I.

548
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:26,399
Please, you're always free

549
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,302
to seek a second opinion.

550
00:31:32,573 --> 00:31:35,009
Mrs. Devers, I believe that

551
00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:38,313
this is an emotional response.

552
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,414
Is there something bothering

553
00:31:39,414 --> 00:31:40,982
you?

554
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:41,850
There's nothing bothering her

555
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,187
at all, thank you, Doctor.

556
00:31:44,187 --> 00:31:46,289
I can't believe this.

557
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:56,067
Hey.

558
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,936
Hey.

559
00:32:03,943 --> 00:32:06,913
Nothin', huh?

560
00:32:06,913 --> 00:32:08,982
That's what they say.

561
00:32:08,982 --> 00:32:09,950
Unless they say I have

562
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,885
everything, which is the same

563
00:32:11,885 --> 00:32:13,087
as nothing.

564
00:32:13,087 --> 00:32:14,488
I'm the sickest healthy person

565
00:32:14,488 --> 00:32:15,289
around.

566
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:16,991
Then they don't know what it

567
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:18,059
is.

568
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:20,996
They mostly say it's stress.

569
00:32:20,996 --> 00:32:22,664
They're doctors, they ought

570
00:32:22,664 --> 00:32:23,498
to know what they're talking

571
00:32:23,498 --> 00:32:24,534
about, that's what it is then.

572
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:25,435
They don't know.

573
00:32:25,435 --> 00:32:26,035
Only I know what's wrong with

574
00:32:26,035 --> 00:32:27,136
me.

575
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,973
You do, huh? What is it?

576
00:32:29,973 --> 00:32:30,941
When I started running,

577
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:32,943
it was almost by accident.

578
00:32:32,943 --> 00:32:35,379
My mother said I had stolen

579
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:38,383
a star from the sky.

580
00:32:38,383 --> 00:32:40,185
I would look up into the night

581
00:32:40,185 --> 00:32:41,386
and I'd wonder which star

582
00:32:41,386 --> 00:32:42,655
I'd stolen.

583
00:32:42,655 --> 00:32:44,357
Then I got scared, 'cause

584
00:32:44,357 --> 00:32:45,358
I realized if I had stolen

585
00:32:45,358 --> 00:32:47,627
a star, it wouldn't be up there,

586
00:32:47,627 --> 00:32:48,962
it would be with me.

587
00:32:48,962 --> 00:32:51,932
Wouldn't God want it back?

588
00:32:51,932 --> 00:32:53,066
I'm saying God came and took his

589
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:54,268
star and stuck it back up in

590
00:32:54,268 --> 00:32:56,237
the sky.

591
00:32:56,237 --> 00:32:57,939
Maybe he doesn't want me running

592
00:32:57,939 --> 00:33:00,074
anymore.

593
00:33:00,074 --> 00:33:01,677
What do you think?

594
00:33:01,677 --> 00:33:06,416
What do I think?

595
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:07,517
I think it's the most words you

596
00:33:07,517 --> 00:33:08,685
said at one time since I've

597
00:33:08,685 --> 00:33:12,523
known you.

598
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:17,094
( thunder )

599
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:18,530
Hey, it's getting a little

600
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,564
late.

601
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,199
Let's go.

602
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,301
No, I'm gonna sit here for

603
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:24,470
a while.

604
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,513
Practice tomorrow, Devers.

605
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:35,349
Be ready.

606
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:40,322
( thunder )

607
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:49,199
Dammit.

608
00:33:49,199 --> 00:33:51,268
You sure running is your gift,

609
00:33:51,268 --> 00:33:53,270
Devers?

610
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,539
You added three tenths to your

611
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:55,173
time.

612
00:33:55,173 --> 00:33:58,009
You must be marked or something.

613
00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:00,044
The great Gail Devers.

614
00:34:00,044 --> 00:34:01,714
It's Mrs. Hampton.

615
00:34:01,714 --> 00:34:06,319
Excuse me. Mrs. Hampton.

616
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,654
Haven't seen your husband around

617
00:34:07,654 --> 00:34:09,222
here in so many months, thought

618
00:34:09,222 --> 00:34:10,657
you might've been a widow.

619
00:34:10,657 --> 00:34:15,196
By the way-- hey!

620
00:34:15,196 --> 00:34:17,098
We don't believe in godspeed

621
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:18,500
here on my track.

622
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,669
We rely on our own.

623
00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:23,138
Got it?

624
00:34:23,138 --> 00:34:25,108
Now do it again and faster this

625
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:26,042
time.

626
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:29,045
Come on!

627
00:34:32,716 --> 00:34:34,651
Show you're right!

628
00:34:34,651 --> 00:34:35,619
How come you didn't do that in

629
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:37,122
the first place?

630
00:34:37,122 --> 00:34:39,090
Much faster when she's mad, huh?

631
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:41,226
Atta girl!

632
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:45,131
Check it out.

633
00:34:45,131 --> 00:34:47,299
Hey, Gail!

634
00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:51,171
Where's she going?

635
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,146
I'm glad you left.

636
00:34:58,146 --> 00:34:59,080
R.J.--

637
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,349
No, no, who the hell is he?

638
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,651
Maybe I should go back.

639
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:04,553
Are you crazy? For what?

640
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:05,788
I'm trying to get you to see

641
00:35:05,788 --> 00:35:07,123
him for who he really is

642
00:35:07,123 --> 00:35:08,124
all along, Gail.

643
00:35:08,124 --> 00:35:09,192
I knew you'd get it one day.

644
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:10,260
R.J., please.

645
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,094
Wouldn't talk to a man like

646
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:11,528
that.

647
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:12,363
You're not going back to him,

648
00:35:12,363 --> 00:35:13,230
Gail, I'm serious.

649
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,199
I'm putting my foot down.

650
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,267
No sneaking behind my back.

651
00:35:16,267 --> 00:35:18,603
And where am I going to find

652
00:35:18,603 --> 00:35:19,838
myself a coach?

653
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:23,542
I'm not gonna give up running.

654
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:29,182
Where? I'll tell you where.

655
00:35:29,182 --> 00:35:34,254
Me.

656
00:35:34,254 --> 00:35:35,589
You?

657
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:37,292
Yeah, Gail.

658
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:38,493
I know everything he knows,

659
00:35:38,493 --> 00:35:39,127
even more.

660
00:35:39,127 --> 00:35:40,161
It'd be great, we can work

661
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:41,796
together every day.

662
00:35:41,796 --> 00:35:43,532
Hey, who knows more about the

663
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:44,767
length of these legs and where

664
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:49,639
they lead than I do? Huh?

665
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:53,276
You'd really coach me?

666
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,480
You promise, R.J.?

667
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,182
I'm a man of my word.

668
00:35:58,182 --> 00:35:59,851
And you know that. Come on.

669
00:35:59,851 --> 00:36:02,254
Let's go. One more set.

670
00:36:02,254 --> 00:36:04,156
Come on, hands up.

671
00:36:04,156 --> 00:36:05,357
R.J., please.

672
00:36:05,357 --> 00:36:06,259
Get the knees up.

673
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:07,227
Knees up.

674
00:36:07,227 --> 00:36:08,294
Come on, let's go.

675
00:36:08,294 --> 00:36:09,562
Get them up!

676
00:36:09,562 --> 00:36:11,264
Slow down, slow down.

677
00:36:11,264 --> 00:36:12,299
All right, let's walk it out.

678
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:14,201
Good. Yeah.

679
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:18,940
We can do this.

680
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,242
Hey, Gail.

681
00:36:20,242 --> 00:36:21,176
How you feeling?

682
00:36:21,176 --> 00:36:22,377
Okay.

683
00:36:22,377 --> 00:36:25,281
Good.

684
00:36:25,281 --> 00:36:30,187
Go in the house, baby.

685
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:32,689
She doesn't want to see you.

686
00:36:32,689 --> 00:36:34,858
Ever.

687
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,231
Why don't you let Gail tell

688
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:40,965
me that.

689
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:41,599
She doesn't even want to see

690
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:42,701
you to tell you she doesn't

691
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,904
want to see you.

692
00:36:44,904 --> 00:36:46,205
That's how much she doesn't want

693
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:49,376
to see you.

694
00:36:57,919 --> 00:37:00,489
All right.

695
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,467
Hey.

696
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:14,338
Hey.

697
00:37:14,338 --> 00:37:15,773
So what happened?

698
00:37:15,773 --> 00:37:17,975
R.J. is training her now.

699
00:37:17,975 --> 00:37:19,344
What?

700
00:37:19,344 --> 00:37:21,313
R.J. is training her now.

701
00:37:21,313 --> 00:37:23,281
Did you talk to Gail?

702
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:25,351
No.

703
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:26,752
You know you didn't help the

704
00:37:26,752 --> 00:37:28,354
situation any, Bobby?

705
00:37:28,354 --> 00:37:29,488
What're you talking about?

706
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:30,490
I got her to the games.

707
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,425
And the fact that she lost,

708
00:37:31,425 --> 00:37:32,426
that's not my fault.

709
00:37:32,426 --> 00:37:33,360
You got her to the Games?

710
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,761
Yes, I got her to the Games.

711
00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:36,664
No, she got herself there

712
00:37:36,664 --> 00:37:38,299
with your help.

713
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:39,367
Maybe there's some other

714
00:37:39,367 --> 00:37:40,835
runners who do want my help.

715
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:42,738
Yeah?

716
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:47,276
None as fast as Gail.

717
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:54,585
You know this makes no sense.

718
00:37:54,585 --> 00:37:56,354
How is R.J. gonna help Gail win

719
00:37:56,354 --> 00:37:58,923
anything, let alone some gold?

720
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:02,361
( alarm buzzes )

721
00:38:09,469 --> 00:38:12,506
R.J. Come on, sweetheart.

722
00:38:12,506 --> 00:38:14,775
Time to hit the track.

723
00:38:14,775 --> 00:38:16,844
Come on, R.J., you'd promised

724
00:38:16,844 --> 00:38:17,678
you'd come with me.

725
00:38:17,678 --> 00:38:19,314
You said this morning you'd

726
00:38:19,314 --> 00:38:21,383
come.

727
00:38:21,383 --> 00:38:24,720
Not now. No. Ugh.

728
00:38:33,363 --> 00:38:35,699
Are you gonna train me or what?

729
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:36,734
We'll do it this weekend.

730
00:38:36,734 --> 00:38:37,635
I promise.

731
00:38:37,635 --> 00:38:39,337
This is the third time, R.J.

732
00:38:39,337 --> 00:38:41,472
I need you to come with me.

733
00:38:41,472 --> 00:38:43,575
I gotta be at work at 9:00.

734
00:38:43,575 --> 00:38:46,979
Come on, now. I'm tired.

735
00:38:57,425 --> 00:39:00,929
( panting )

736
00:39:16,914 --> 00:39:20,752
Gail?

737
00:39:31,431 --> 00:39:32,165
I wouldn't have phoned,

738
00:39:32,165 --> 00:39:33,867
Dr. Otis, but you're my last

739
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:34,768
hope.

740
00:39:34,768 --> 00:39:36,971
It's fine. Sit down.

741
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:39,040
I-- I haven't been feeling

742
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,741
well.

743
00:39:39,741 --> 00:39:42,945
Uh-huh.

744
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:48,518
Right. I see.

745
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:50,520
How long ago did this start?

746
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:55,693
I don't know, a year?

747
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,128
No, longer, while I was still

748
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,665
on the team.

749
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:04,603
I see your skin.

750
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:05,937
Something's wrong with me,

751
00:40:05,937 --> 00:40:08,574
isn't it?

752
00:40:18,052 --> 00:40:19,521
Gail, I believe something is

753
00:40:19,521 --> 00:40:22,624
wrong.

754
00:40:22,624 --> 00:40:23,491
I have a friend of mine,

755
00:40:23,491 --> 00:40:24,593
Dr. Ginsburg.

756
00:40:24,593 --> 00:40:26,028
He's a wonderful doctor.

757
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:28,531
And I want you to see him.

758
00:40:28,531 --> 00:40:29,698
You tell him everything you told

759
00:40:29,698 --> 00:40:32,102
me.

760
00:40:32,102 --> 00:40:33,170
"It's nothing."

761
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:33,804
"Is there something bothering

762
00:40:33,804 --> 00:40:34,971
you?"

763
00:40:34,971 --> 00:40:36,707
"It's probably just stress."

764
00:40:36,707 --> 00:40:38,976
Dr. Otis, I need you to come

765
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:39,977
with me.

766
00:40:39,977 --> 00:40:41,813
Oh, Gail. You just tell him--

767
00:40:41,813 --> 00:40:42,414
No, no, I need you to come

768
00:40:42,414 --> 00:40:43,215
with me.

769
00:40:43,215 --> 00:40:44,516
I need you to tell him.

770
00:40:44,516 --> 00:40:45,984
You tell everybody.

771
00:40:45,984 --> 00:40:50,190
Nobody believes me.

772
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:54,528
Okay.

773
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,496
I bet you just came from the

774
00:40:55,496 --> 00:40:57,731
track.

775
00:40:57,731 --> 00:41:00,535
I bet you're thirsty.

776
00:41:00,535 --> 00:41:01,803
Yes.

777
00:41:01,803 --> 00:41:03,238
Come on, let's get something

778
00:41:03,238 --> 00:41:07,643
to drink, all right?

779
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:08,945
He was easy to talk to.

780
00:41:08,945 --> 00:41:10,613
That's for sure.

781
00:41:10,613 --> 00:41:12,516
We can get some answers.

782
00:41:15,052 --> 00:41:16,186
Robin.

783
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:18,623
Dr. Otis.

784
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:21,960
Gail.

785
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,063
Well, Gail, your thyroid's

786
00:41:24,063 --> 00:41:25,097
out of whack.

787
00:41:25,097 --> 00:41:26,699
( chuckles )

788
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:29,168
What does that mean?

789
00:41:29,168 --> 00:41:30,837
Well, the thyroid's a gland.

790
00:41:30,837 --> 00:41:33,707
Located right about here.

791
00:41:33,707 --> 00:41:35,575
And it secretes hormones that

792
00:41:35,575 --> 00:41:38,045
control your metabolism,

793
00:41:38,045 --> 00:41:39,947
your nervous system, and the

794
00:41:39,947 --> 00:41:42,017
action of your muscles.

795
00:41:42,017 --> 00:41:42,985
At least that's what it's

796
00:41:42,985 --> 00:41:44,853
supposed to do.

797
00:41:44,853 --> 00:41:47,055
Yours is not working very well.

798
00:41:47,055 --> 00:41:48,691
It's also why your weight

799
00:41:48,691 --> 00:41:49,592
goes up and down.

800
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:50,994
I knew I wasn't crazy.

801
00:41:50,994 --> 00:41:52,228
I knew there was something wrong

802
00:41:52,228 --> 00:41:53,563
all the time.

803
00:41:53,563 --> 00:41:54,164
You're definitely not

804
00:41:54,164 --> 00:41:55,266
imagining things, Gail.

805
00:41:55,266 --> 00:41:56,667
That's good to hear.

806
00:41:56,667 --> 00:42:00,872
Grave's disease is very real.

807
00:42:00,872 --> 00:42:02,707
How serious is it?

808
00:42:02,707 --> 00:42:04,576
You see your thyroid is twice

809
00:42:04,576 --> 00:42:06,279
the size that it should be.

810
00:42:06,279 --> 00:42:07,013
So?

811
00:42:07,013 --> 00:42:08,080
We need to get it back down

812
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,749
to normal size.

813
00:42:09,749 --> 00:42:10,383
Well, how are you going to do

814
00:42:10,383 --> 00:42:11,617
that?

815
00:42:11,617 --> 00:42:14,588
Well, to be honest, I'm going

816
00:42:14,588 --> 00:42:16,189
to need some time before I can

817
00:42:16,189 --> 00:42:17,357
advise you on the best

818
00:42:17,357 --> 00:42:18,326
treatment.

819
00:42:18,326 --> 00:42:21,162
Treatment.

820
00:42:21,162 --> 00:42:22,630
So, there's a cure?

821
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,133
Doctor, there is a cure, isn't

822
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:25,034
there?

823
00:42:25,034 --> 00:42:26,602
What are you telling me?

824
00:42:26,602 --> 00:42:30,907
No cure.

825
00:43:03,211 --> 00:43:05,680
Gail, where have you been?

826
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,383
I was just getting ready to

827
00:43:07,383 --> 00:43:10,820
start calling around for you.

828
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:13,890
There's no cure, R.J.

829
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:15,258
Nothing.

830
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:16,259
For the rest of my life I'll

831
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:17,194
just have it.

832
00:43:17,194 --> 00:43:18,262
Maybe they're wrong again.

833
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,798
No. No, not this time.

834
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:23,201
Come on, babe. Come on.

835
00:43:23,201 --> 00:43:27,006
Everything's gonna be just fine.

836
00:43:27,006 --> 00:43:28,707
He just comes in.

837
00:43:28,707 --> 00:43:31,778
Read it and weep.

838
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:35,950
( overlapping dialogue )

839
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,852
Don't look at them till you

840
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:38,686
have to.

841
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:42,224
That was a 24 shot clock.

842
00:43:42,224 --> 00:43:43,692
At the time, maybe.

843
00:43:43,692 --> 00:43:45,394
Does not run long.

844
00:43:45,394 --> 00:43:47,262
Hold on.

845
00:43:47,262 --> 00:43:48,831
Time out!

846
00:43:48,831 --> 00:43:52,802
( phone rings )

847
00:44:00,278 --> 00:44:01,913
Yeah, he is. Hold on.

848
00:44:01,913 --> 00:44:06,218
Bobby. Bobby? It's Dr. Otis.

849
00:44:09,121 --> 00:44:12,993
Hey, Doc.

850
00:44:12,993 --> 00:44:17,497
What?

851
00:44:17,497 --> 00:44:18,399
Ugh.

852
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:23,504
All right. Thank you.

853
00:44:23,504 --> 00:44:26,508
What'd she want?

854
00:44:26,508 --> 00:44:30,480
Gail's not doing too well.

855
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,482
You already knew that.

856
00:44:32,482 --> 00:44:35,185
Gotta get back to the game.

857
00:44:35,185 --> 00:44:36,821
Y'all?

858
00:44:36,821 --> 00:44:39,256
Gail's not doing too well.

859
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:43,428
She's worse than we thought.

860
00:44:43,428 --> 00:44:44,796
Poor R.J.

861
00:44:44,796 --> 00:44:46,998
You guys go ahead.

862
00:44:46,998 --> 00:44:48,334
She gonna be all right?

863
00:44:48,334 --> 00:44:51,537
Excuse me.

864
00:44:58,412 --> 00:44:59,781
Leave a message, and we'll

865
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:00,815
call you back. ( beeps )

866
00:45:00,815 --> 00:45:02,817
Hey, Gail? This is Bobby.

867
00:45:02,817 --> 00:45:08,057
Pick up. Gail?

868
00:45:08,057 --> 00:45:10,059
It's Bobby.

869
00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:11,962
Call me when you get this

870
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:16,333
message, all right?

871
00:45:54,444 --> 00:45:58,048
We got each other, baby.

872
00:45:58,048 --> 00:46:01,019
No more heartbreak about

873
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:04,856
running after the gold.

874
00:46:04,856 --> 00:46:10,262
We'll settle down and be normal.

875
00:46:10,262 --> 00:46:15,902
Have a family.

876
00:46:15,902 --> 00:46:19,407
Just be together.

877
00:46:35,158 --> 00:46:36,994
When will I be able to run

878
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:39,897
again?

879
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:43,301
Well, you may be able to run

880
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,469
again someday.

881
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:45,904
When?

882
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:48,040
I'm recommending radiation

883
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,575
therapy to shrink your thyroid,

884
00:46:49,575 --> 00:46:51,110
Gail, and I expect very good

885
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,078
results from that.

886
00:46:52,078 --> 00:46:54,214
But the side effects can be very

887
00:46:54,214 --> 00:46:57,918
uncomfortable.

888
00:46:57,918 --> 00:46:59,019
Now, the beta blockers will

889
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:00,922
help your body through all of

890
00:47:00,922 --> 00:47:03,558
that and help protect you.

891
00:47:03,558 --> 00:47:04,926
Gail, you've gotta understand

892
00:47:04,926 --> 00:47:05,661
one thing.

893
00:47:05,661 --> 00:47:07,029
What?

894
00:47:07,029 --> 00:47:08,264
This whole treatment is gonna

895
00:47:08,264 --> 00:47:09,665
slow you down.

896
00:47:09,665 --> 00:47:12,469
It'll be a very long time

897
00:47:12,469 --> 00:47:16,072
before--

898
00:47:16,072 --> 00:47:17,540
before you have the energy to

899
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,978
run again.

900
00:47:31,424 --> 00:47:33,660
Hey, hey, Gail.

901
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:36,997
Hold up.

902
00:47:36,997 --> 00:47:39,667
What's the word about you?

903
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:41,402
Dr. Otis called me and she--

904
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:44,072
she told me about your illness.

905
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:44,673
So it took Otis to convince

906
00:47:44,673 --> 00:47:45,540
you.

907
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:46,608
Come on, I knew there was

908
00:47:46,608 --> 00:47:48,010
something wrong, I just couldn't

909
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,211
put my finger on it.

910
00:47:49,211 --> 00:47:51,447
I did try to call you.

911
00:47:51,447 --> 00:47:53,082
Hey, hey, you're gonna beat

912
00:47:53,082 --> 00:47:53,984
this.

913
00:47:53,984 --> 00:47:55,252
You might even run again.

914
00:47:55,252 --> 00:47:56,687
You don't know anything about

915
00:47:56,687 --> 00:47:57,554
my business, Bobby.

916
00:47:57,554 --> 00:48:00,291
Hey, Gail.

917
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:02,393
You hang tough.

918
00:48:02,393 --> 00:48:03,261
Gail, let's go.

919
00:48:03,261 --> 00:48:05,096
I'm parked in the red.

920
00:48:05,096 --> 00:48:06,665
There's my ride.

921
00:48:06,665 --> 00:48:09,301
You all right?

922
00:48:09,301 --> 00:48:10,102
It's cool.

923
00:48:10,102 --> 00:48:12,138
Come on, let's go.

924
00:48:23,017 --> 00:48:24,586
You have reached the

925
00:48:24,586 --> 00:48:26,621
International Athletic Medical

926
00:48:26,621 --> 00:48:28,023
Hotline.

927
00:48:28,023 --> 00:48:29,291
The following are a list of

928
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:30,426
drugs banned by current

929
00:48:30,426 --> 00:48:32,061
guidelines.

930
00:48:32,061 --> 00:48:35,531
All steroids, Corticotrophin,

931
00:48:35,531 --> 00:48:37,334
Erythropoietin,

932
00:48:37,334 --> 00:48:39,336
and Somatototrophin are also

933
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:41,372
included in this group.

934
00:48:41,372 --> 00:48:43,508
All beta blockers are also

935
00:48:43,508 --> 00:48:45,043
banned.

936
00:48:45,043 --> 00:48:46,711
If the use of any banned drugs

937
00:48:46,711 --> 00:48:48,614
are detected, the offender is

938
00:48:48,614 --> 00:48:50,216
subject to due process and

939
00:48:50,216 --> 00:48:51,417
possible expulsion from the

940
00:48:51,417 --> 00:48:54,354
Games for two years to life.

941
00:49:05,166 --> 00:49:10,372
( coughing )

942
00:49:44,879 --> 00:49:45,880
Gail?

943
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,182
R.J.

944
00:49:47,182 --> 00:49:48,584
What're you doing? You sick?

945
00:49:48,584 --> 00:49:50,286
Give me some privacy, please.

946
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:52,221
Are you sick? Gail, not one.

947
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:54,191
You haven't taken one pill.

948
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,125
I'm not gonna sit here--

949
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:56,827
No! You're killing yourself!

950
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,161
And you're fucking killing me!

951
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,463
I'm not taking it anymore!

952
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:00,832
You better take these pills.

953
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:01,866
You don't understand!

954
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:02,700
I do understand!

955
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,501
I know right now!

956
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:04,569
You gotta stop, girl.

957
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:05,369
You gotta stop!

958
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,438
I'm not taking this shit no

959
00:50:06,438 --> 00:50:07,473
more!

960
00:50:07,473 --> 00:50:12,278
I'm not taking it, Gail!

961
00:50:12,278 --> 00:50:16,182
( door opens, slams )

962
00:50:27,629 --> 00:50:32,335
( thunder )

963
00:50:33,336 --> 00:50:37,241
Not taking this shit.

964
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:51,257
Tell her to take this

965
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:54,394
medication, please.

966
00:50:54,394 --> 00:50:57,931
She's hurting.

967
00:50:57,931 --> 00:50:58,965
She's not taking this medication

968
00:50:58,965 --> 00:51:00,201
because she believes you want

969
00:51:00,201 --> 00:51:00,835
her to go back to the Games.

970
00:51:00,835 --> 00:51:01,869
I didn't tell her that.

971
00:51:01,869 --> 00:51:03,237
Doesn't matter.

972
00:51:03,237 --> 00:51:05,339
You and I both know Gail is

973
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:07,276
never gonna run again.

974
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:08,377
So even if the beta blockers

975
00:51:08,377 --> 00:51:09,344
are banned by the committee,

976
00:51:09,344 --> 00:51:10,345
she'll never be tested because

977
00:51:10,345 --> 00:51:12,382
her running career is over.

978
00:51:12,382 --> 00:51:13,483
Look, you are her husband.

979
00:51:13,483 --> 00:51:14,350
You tell her to take them.

980
00:51:14,350 --> 00:51:16,286
You're the great Bob Kersee.

981
00:51:16,286 --> 00:51:17,821
The guru. That's right.

982
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:18,956
She'll listen to you before she

983
00:51:18,956 --> 00:51:19,557
listens to me.

984
00:51:19,557 --> 00:51:20,324
She always has!

985
00:51:20,324 --> 00:51:21,225
She hasn't done that in a

986
00:51:21,225 --> 00:51:22,293
long time, and you know when

987
00:51:22,293 --> 00:51:24,296
that stopped.

988
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:38,245
She can't sleep.

989
00:51:38,245 --> 00:51:41,449
Her hair is falling out.

990
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:43,785
Her legs bleed, her face peels.

991
00:51:43,785 --> 00:51:44,953
So would you please tell her to

992
00:51:44,953 --> 00:51:48,357
take the beta blockers?

993
00:51:48,357 --> 00:51:52,494
I don't know.

994
00:51:52,494 --> 00:51:54,998
I'll think about it, okay?

995
00:51:54,998 --> 00:51:57,334
I'll think about it.

996
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:15,421
Dr. Bates, please report to

997
00:52:15,421 --> 00:52:16,756
radiation therapy.

998
00:52:16,756 --> 00:52:19,326
Dr. Bates to radiation therapy.

999
00:52:26,001 --> 00:52:28,403
Hey, hey.

1000
00:52:28,403 --> 00:52:33,476
Hey.

1001
00:52:33,476 --> 00:52:35,712
How's it going?

1002
00:52:35,712 --> 00:52:38,415
All right.

1003
00:52:38,415 --> 00:52:40,317
Pain's not as bad as they said.

1004
00:52:40,317 --> 00:52:40,984
Good.

1005
00:52:40,984 --> 00:52:41,586
The radiation will be over

1006
00:52:41,586 --> 00:52:42,854
soon.

1007
00:52:42,854 --> 00:52:43,821
How soon?

1008
00:52:43,821 --> 00:52:46,424
Soon enough.

1009
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:48,027
Oh.

1010
00:52:48,027 --> 00:52:53,332
Soon enough for Barcelona.

1011
00:52:53,332 --> 00:52:54,834
I don't think we should be

1012
00:52:54,834 --> 00:52:55,735
worrying about Barcelona right

1013
00:52:55,735 --> 00:52:57,504
now.

1014
00:53:01,042 --> 00:53:02,476
This grass needs to be

1015
00:53:02,476 --> 00:53:04,445
watered.

1016
00:53:09,518 --> 00:53:11,421
You're thinking I should take

1017
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,990
that medicine.

1018
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:21,932
Maybe.

1019
00:53:24,836 --> 00:53:26,938
You can't even say it.

1020
00:53:26,938 --> 00:53:28,373
Bob Kersee never just thinks

1021
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:31,911
maybe about anything.

1022
00:53:31,911 --> 00:53:33,612
You really don't want me to take

1023
00:53:33,612 --> 00:53:36,683
that medicine.

1024
00:53:36,683 --> 00:53:37,417
I can't tell you--

1025
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:38,919
You can't do it.

1026
00:53:38,919 --> 00:53:39,853
You can't tell me to give up

1027
00:53:39,853 --> 00:53:41,489
any hope I have of ever going

1028
00:53:41,489 --> 00:53:41,889
to the Games.

1029
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:42,990
Gail, listen, please.

1030
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:43,925
Tell me to take them and

1031
00:53:43,925 --> 00:53:44,992
I will.

1032
00:53:44,992 --> 00:53:46,127
I can't tell you--

1033
00:53:46,127 --> 00:53:47,930
I lied about the pain.

1034
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:51,867
It's bad. It's real bad.

1035
00:53:51,867 --> 00:53:54,104
Tell me to take them.

1036
00:53:54,104 --> 00:53:55,438
Gail--

1037
00:53:55,438 --> 00:53:57,540
I get night sweats.

1038
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,475
My head aches so bad, I'm afraid

1039
00:53:58,475 --> 00:53:59,844
I'm gonna die, and then I'm

1040
00:53:59,844 --> 00:54:00,878
afraid of-- I'm afraid I'm not

1041
00:54:00,878 --> 00:54:01,846
gonna die.

1042
00:54:01,846 --> 00:54:03,180
Tell me to take them, Bobby.

1043
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,582
Please, Gail.

1044
00:54:04,582 --> 00:54:05,450
Should I take them?

1045
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,184
What're you doing?

1046
00:54:06,184 --> 00:54:07,519
Say yes, and I will.

1047
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:08,520
Come on.

1048
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,755
Gail-- hey!

1049
00:54:09,755 --> 00:54:10,322
Just pick one up and hand

1050
00:54:10,322 --> 00:54:11,557
it to me.

1051
00:54:11,557 --> 00:54:12,759
What're you doing?

1052
00:54:12,759 --> 00:54:14,994
Tell Jackie I said hi.

1053
00:54:18,065 --> 00:54:23,605
Gail!

1054
00:54:23,605 --> 00:54:26,741
Damn!

1055
00:55:44,765 --> 00:55:49,071
Mommy! Here I come!

1056
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:54,577
( kid's laughter echoes )

1057
00:56:00,284 --> 00:56:03,888
I may pass you!

1058
00:57:17,708 --> 00:57:19,142
( birds chirping )

1059
00:57:19,142 --> 00:57:20,310
It's a beautiful day in

1060
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:21,378
Los Angeles.

1061
00:57:21,378 --> 00:57:23,648
Rise and shine and I want Jesus

1062
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,149
to walk with me.

1063
00:57:25,149 --> 00:57:28,753
( gospel music plays )

1064
00:57:37,897 --> 00:57:42,703
( laughter, doorbell )

1065
00:57:58,354 --> 00:58:00,824
Here's my baby.

1066
00:58:00,824 --> 00:58:04,294
Hi.

1067
00:58:04,294 --> 00:58:07,298
I'm so glad you're here.

1068
00:58:07,298 --> 00:58:11,036
Look, who's here, everybody!

1069
00:58:11,036 --> 00:58:13,039
( all saying hello )

1070
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:14,940
How you all doing?

1071
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:17,744
Um, Papa's in the den, right?

1072
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,113
Yes, I think so.

1073
00:58:23,117 --> 00:58:24,385
Hey, Papa.

1074
00:58:24,385 --> 00:58:27,321
Hi, sweetie.

1075
00:58:27,321 --> 00:58:29,792
Happy Birthday.

1076
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:30,859
This is for you.

1077
00:58:30,859 --> 00:58:33,462
Whoa. Look at this.

1078
00:58:33,462 --> 00:58:34,296
What is it?

1079
00:58:34,296 --> 00:58:35,498
Open it and see.

1080
00:58:35,498 --> 00:58:36,733
Okay, gimmie that.

1081
00:58:36,733 --> 00:58:37,400
I'm thirsty, I'm gonna get

1082
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,368
something to drink.

1083
00:58:38,368 --> 00:58:42,073
All right.

1084
00:58:42,073 --> 00:58:45,810
Excuse me.

1085
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,371
When's R.J. coming?

1086
00:59:10,371 --> 00:59:12,441
I don't know.

1087
00:59:12,441 --> 00:59:13,309
You don't know when he's

1088
00:59:13,309 --> 00:59:14,877
coming?

1089
00:59:14,877 --> 00:59:16,378
I don't even know where he's

1090
00:59:16,378 --> 00:59:17,214
at.

1091
00:59:17,214 --> 00:59:19,483
I haven't for over a week or so.

1092
00:59:19,483 --> 00:59:21,785
I don't understand.

1093
00:59:21,785 --> 00:59:25,823
Where would R.J. be?

1094
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,925
I don't know, Papa.

1095
00:59:27,925 --> 00:59:28,860
He stopped leaving me notes a

1096
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:30,028
long time ago.

1097
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:31,029
Wait, I don't understand.

1098
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:32,264
What did you do, have a fight or

1099
00:59:32,264 --> 00:59:33,565
something?

1100
00:59:33,565 --> 00:59:34,967
What is all this about, huh?

1101
00:59:34,967 --> 00:59:37,537
Look at me.

1102
00:59:37,537 --> 00:59:38,872
What do you mean?

1103
00:59:38,872 --> 00:59:40,940
Look at me.

1104
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,343
Well, honey--

1105
00:59:42,343 --> 00:59:43,544
Sweetheart, this--

1106
00:59:43,544 --> 00:59:45,012
Would you all just look at

1107
00:59:45,012 --> 00:59:45,913
me!

1108
00:59:45,913 --> 00:59:47,182
That's going to go away.

1109
00:59:47,182 --> 00:59:47,916
Yes.

1110
00:59:47,916 --> 00:59:49,918
Somebody help me please!

1111
00:59:49,918 --> 00:59:51,953
We're here to help you.

1112
00:59:51,953 --> 00:59:53,556
Be patient.

1113
00:59:53,556 --> 00:59:56,192
I've always told you, god

1114
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:56,993
will find a way--

1115
00:59:56,993 --> 00:59:57,860
Oh, please, Papa!

1116
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,931
I don't know anymore prayers!

1117
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:03,233
Don't you talk that way now.

1118
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:04,468
Why does god hate me?

1119
01:00:04,468 --> 01:00:06,004
God does not hate you.

1120
01:00:06,004 --> 01:00:07,272
Why doesn't he help me?

1121
01:00:07,272 --> 01:00:11,277
Oh, baby.

1122
01:00:11,277 --> 01:00:12,845
Come stay with us.

1123
01:00:12,845 --> 01:00:14,313
Come home with us.

1124
01:00:14,313 --> 01:00:15,581
Stay here.

1125
01:00:15,581 --> 01:00:17,083
Did he leave you?

1126
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:19,886
( overlapping dialogue )

1127
01:00:19,886 --> 01:00:20,921
I can't stay here.

1128
01:00:20,921 --> 01:00:23,191
You shouldn't be alone Gail.

1129
01:00:23,191 --> 01:00:25,626
You can't--

1130
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:30,032
I'm going after her.

1131
01:00:30,032 --> 01:00:31,533
No, no, no, let her go.

1132
01:00:31,533 --> 01:00:32,935
Let her go.

1133
01:00:32,935 --> 01:00:37,607
She wants to be alone.

1134
01:00:37,607 --> 01:00:39,108
( guests murmuring )

1135
01:00:39,108 --> 01:00:41,912
That's our baby. She need us.

1136
01:00:41,912 --> 01:00:43,914
I know that.

1137
01:00:43,914 --> 01:00:45,015
There's nothing we can do about

1138
01:00:45,015 --> 01:00:47,352
it now.

1139
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:48,386
In God's hands.

1140
01:00:48,386 --> 01:00:51,623
God's hands. God's will.

1141
01:00:51,623 --> 01:00:56,395
God, God, God.

1142
01:00:56,395 --> 01:00:58,664
When are you going to see

1143
01:00:58,664 --> 01:01:01,168
that it was Gail's will to

1144
01:01:01,168 --> 01:01:03,637
run all those hurdles?

1145
01:01:03,637 --> 01:01:05,340
Gail's will to break through all

1146
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:06,474
those finishing tapes?

1147
01:01:06,474 --> 01:01:07,642
Wasn't Gail's will there

1148
01:01:07,642 --> 01:01:11,947
somewhere?

1149
01:01:11,947 --> 01:01:13,048
When are you going to give Gail

1150
01:01:13,048 --> 01:01:16,418
credit for what she's done?

1151
01:01:16,418 --> 01:01:18,655
When are you going to stop

1152
01:01:18,655 --> 01:01:22,325
putting God in your place?

1153
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:41,015
( phone rings )

1154
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:27,201
Maybe she just wants to be

1155
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,771
by herself, Bobby.

1156
01:02:52,163 --> 01:02:54,400
( doorbell chimes )

1157
01:02:58,738 --> 01:02:59,806
She's not home.

1158
01:02:59,806 --> 01:03:01,141
Her car is still here.

1159
01:03:01,141 --> 01:03:02,576
She might not want to see us.

1160
01:03:10,118 --> 01:03:13,155
Bobby, what--

1161
01:03:13,155 --> 01:03:15,157
I'm going in.

1162
01:03:15,157 --> 01:03:17,594
Come on. Come on.

1163
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:25,636
Hey, Gail!

1164
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:27,538
Hey, girl!

1165
01:03:27,538 --> 01:03:29,775
Gail?

1166
01:03:31,176 --> 01:03:35,148
It's Jackie and Bobby!

1167
01:03:51,866 --> 01:03:54,370
Gail?

1168
01:04:00,243 --> 01:04:00,811
Why are all these mirrors

1169
01:04:00,811 --> 01:04:01,711
covered?

1170
01:04:01,711 --> 01:04:03,680
I don't know.

1171
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,617
This is strange.

1172
01:04:06,617 --> 01:04:08,619
I told you.

1173
01:04:08,619 --> 01:04:10,455
Told you she wasn't here.

1174
01:04:10,455 --> 01:04:13,292
Want me to leave a note?

1175
01:04:13,292 --> 01:04:14,526
We'll call her next time.

1176
01:04:14,526 --> 01:04:16,595
And next time she better answer.

1177
01:04:20,133 --> 01:04:22,435
( door closes )

1178
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:46,196
( sobs softly )

1179
01:04:46,196 --> 01:04:47,432
Let's take a look at

1180
01:04:47,432 --> 01:04:48,333
highlights in today's

1181
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:51,803
championship.

1182
01:04:51,803 --> 01:04:56,342
( garbled sportscast )

1183
01:05:14,796 --> 01:05:19,235
( jazz music plays )

1184
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:24,645
And they're off!

1185
01:06:24,645 --> 01:06:27,748
( jazz music plays )

1186
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,395
Lawrence by a body length!

1187
01:06:54,346 --> 01:06:58,050
Gail?

1188
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:01,021
Gail.

1189
01:07:04,825 --> 01:07:07,395
Gail?

1190
01:07:07,395 --> 01:07:10,766
Gail.

1191
01:07:10,766 --> 01:07:15,103
Gail?

1192
01:07:16,639 --> 01:07:18,875
Oh, Gail.

1193
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:21,644
Baby, wake up.

1194
01:07:21,644 --> 01:07:24,448
What have you done? Oh, God.

1195
01:07:24,448 --> 01:07:26,717
Oh, no.

1196
01:07:26,717 --> 01:07:28,987
Gail, wake up. Just wake--

1197
01:07:28,987 --> 01:07:32,457
No. Come on, baby.

1198
01:07:35,528 --> 01:07:38,364
( panting )

1199
01:07:42,869 --> 01:07:46,941
( no audible dialogue )

1200
01:07:57,386 --> 01:07:58,087
Nurse, have you heard

1201
01:07:58,087 --> 01:08:01,658
anything from the doctor yet?

1202
01:08:06,731 --> 01:08:07,798
Nothing, huh?

1203
01:08:07,798 --> 01:08:08,999
There's R.J.

1204
01:08:08,999 --> 01:08:10,802
R.J., where is she?

1205
01:08:10,802 --> 01:08:12,571
I found her at the house.

1206
01:08:12,571 --> 01:08:13,171
I didn't--

1207
01:08:13,171 --> 01:08:14,473
You didn't find her, you left

1208
01:08:14,473 --> 01:08:15,073
her!

1209
01:08:15,073 --> 01:08:16,508
No, no, no. I tried--

1210
01:08:16,508 --> 01:08:17,443
R.J., don't you stand there

1211
01:08:17,443 --> 01:08:18,544
and tell me you tried to do

1212
01:08:18,544 --> 01:08:19,512
anything!

1213
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:20,980
You abandoned my daughter.

1214
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:21,681
That's what you did.

1215
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:23,851
I did not! I tried to--

1216
01:08:23,851 --> 01:08:25,018
She cut me out!

1217
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:25,853
You did?

1218
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:27,421
She didn't want me!

1219
01:08:27,421 --> 01:08:28,623
That's not true.

1220
01:08:28,623 --> 01:08:29,557
I told her to take that

1221
01:08:29,557 --> 01:08:30,692
medication and--

1222
01:08:30,692 --> 01:08:31,526
Where is she?

1223
01:08:31,526 --> 01:08:32,494
Where is she? What room is she

1224
01:08:32,494 --> 01:08:33,762
in?

1225
01:08:33,762 --> 01:08:36,932
I can't do this.

1226
01:08:36,932 --> 01:08:38,167
I'm outta here.

1227
01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:38,734
You won't listen to me, you

1228
01:08:38,734 --> 01:08:39,668
handle it.

1229
01:08:39,668 --> 01:08:41,671
Where's Dr. Ginburg?

1230
01:08:41,671 --> 01:08:43,940
Larry, here he is.

1231
01:08:43,940 --> 01:08:45,142
How is Gail? Where is she?

1232
01:08:45,142 --> 01:08:47,078
Mrs. Devers, Reverend.

1233
01:08:47,078 --> 01:08:49,614
Gail's been hemorrhaging a lot.

1234
01:08:49,614 --> 01:08:50,782
I'm going to see her.

1235
01:08:50,782 --> 01:08:53,585
Wait. Hemorrhaging from what?

1236
01:08:53,585 --> 01:08:55,487
It's a side effect die to the

1237
01:08:55,487 --> 01:08:57,556
high radiation toxicity level.

1238
01:08:57,556 --> 01:08:58,725
Gail's going to recover from

1239
01:08:58,725 --> 01:08:59,793
this.

1240
01:08:59,793 --> 01:09:00,760
And they're will be no more

1241
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:01,761
radiation treatments.

1242
01:09:01,761 --> 01:09:03,496
Oh, thank God.

1243
01:09:03,496 --> 01:09:05,199
But the damage to her feet,

1244
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:07,234
is critical.

1245
01:09:07,234 --> 01:09:08,636
How critical?

1246
01:09:08,636 --> 01:09:10,070
Not taking the beta blockers.

1247
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:11,006
Wait a minute.

1248
01:09:11,006 --> 01:09:12,040
What are you talking about, beta

1249
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:12,808
blockers?

1250
01:09:12,808 --> 01:09:14,242
I'm sorry, I gave her some

1251
01:09:14,242 --> 01:09:15,243
medicine that she was supposed

1252
01:09:15,243 --> 01:09:16,478
to take that would help her

1253
01:09:16,478 --> 01:09:17,547
through this period.

1254
01:09:17,547 --> 01:09:18,548
And for some reason, she didn't.

1255
01:09:18,548 --> 01:09:19,715
It's compromised her immune

1256
01:09:19,715 --> 01:09:21,517
system, it's left her vulnerable

1257
01:09:21,517 --> 01:09:22,586
to infection.

1258
01:09:22,586 --> 01:09:24,621
Doctor, please.

1259
01:09:24,621 --> 01:09:25,589
Worst case?

1260
01:09:25,589 --> 01:09:26,623
Yes.

1261
01:09:26,623 --> 01:09:28,560
She might have to have her

1262
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,661
feet amputated.

1263
01:09:29,661 --> 01:09:31,830
Oh, my God.

1264
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:32,897
I'm sorry.

1265
01:09:32,897 --> 01:09:37,536
Oh, no.

1266
01:09:37,536 --> 01:09:39,138
Can we go see her?

1267
01:09:39,138 --> 01:09:40,974
Why don't you look after

1268
01:09:40,974 --> 01:09:41,842
each other right now.

1269
01:09:41,842 --> 01:09:42,943
I'll come and get you when

1270
01:09:42,943 --> 01:09:46,581
there's time.

1271
01:09:46,581 --> 01:09:47,715
All right, sweetheart.

1272
01:09:47,715 --> 01:09:51,719
I need you to be strong, okay?

1273
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,632
How is she?

1274
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:04,869
Bobby, we don't know.

1275
01:10:04,869 --> 01:10:06,537
Still waiting to hear.

1276
01:10:06,537 --> 01:10:07,538
What happened?

1277
01:10:07,538 --> 01:10:10,174
Bobby, she is so sick, she

1278
01:10:10,174 --> 01:10:12,544
may never walk again.

1279
01:10:12,544 --> 01:10:16,047
Never walk?

1280
01:10:16,047 --> 01:10:18,718
Dr. Ginsburg said that he--

1281
01:10:18,718 --> 01:10:19,919
I mean she hadn't been taking

1282
01:10:19,919 --> 01:10:21,120
some medication she was

1283
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,723
prescribed.

1284
01:10:22,723 --> 01:10:24,858
Oh.

1285
01:10:24,858 --> 01:10:25,993
Yeah, R.J. mentioned that

1286
01:10:25,993 --> 01:10:28,930
a few weeks ago.

1287
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:31,766
So you knew? Huh?

1288
01:10:31,766 --> 01:10:33,668
I visited her and we talked

1289
01:10:33,668 --> 01:10:34,570
about it.

1290
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:35,905
Bobby, are you telling me

1291
01:10:35,905 --> 01:10:37,239
that you never told her to take

1292
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:38,974
that medication?

1293
01:10:38,974 --> 01:10:41,311
No.

1294
01:10:41,311 --> 01:10:44,180
She said, she knew what she

1295
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:44,881
wanted.

1296
01:10:44,881 --> 01:10:46,283
I'm just a little confused.

1297
01:10:46,283 --> 01:10:47,985
For six years now, she's done

1298
01:10:47,985 --> 01:10:48,886
everything you've said.

1299
01:10:48,886 --> 01:10:51,756
Reverend Devers, on the track

1300
01:10:51,756 --> 01:10:55,127
and in the gym, I'm God.

1301
01:10:55,127 --> 01:10:59,132
She does what I tell her to.

1302
01:10:59,132 --> 01:11:02,268
But this came from inside Gail.

1303
01:11:02,268 --> 01:11:03,770
Said she knew what she wanted.

1304
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:08,776
Nothing I could say.

1305
01:11:08,776 --> 01:11:12,380
If something happens to Gail,

1306
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:16,886
it'll kill her mother.

1307
01:11:21,290 --> 01:11:22,659
We just have to have faith

1308
01:11:22,659 --> 01:11:23,727
and everything will be all

1309
01:11:23,727 --> 01:11:26,263
right.

1310
01:11:26,263 --> 01:11:28,933
You believe in God, Bobby?

1311
01:11:28,933 --> 01:11:31,102
I believe in Gail.

1312
01:11:37,209 --> 01:11:41,815
I believe you do.

1313
01:11:41,815 --> 01:11:44,250
I believe you do.

1314
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,318
Can I go see her?

1315
01:11:45,318 --> 01:11:48,923
Please.

1316
01:12:22,896 --> 01:12:26,333
Bobby.

1317
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:29,437
Hey.

1318
01:12:37,446 --> 01:12:39,915
Bobby, they wanna take my

1319
01:12:39,915 --> 01:12:43,853
feet.

1320
01:12:43,853 --> 01:12:45,789
Don't talk, just stay relaxed

1321
01:12:45,789 --> 01:12:47,224
and take it easy.

1322
01:12:47,224 --> 01:12:49,193
You go out there and you tell

1323
01:12:49,193 --> 01:12:53,765
them, they can't have my feet.

1324
01:12:59,806 --> 01:13:02,375
I should've taken that

1325
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:05,079
medicine.

1326
01:13:16,124 --> 01:13:18,828
What's that?

1327
01:13:18,828 --> 01:13:20,963
What's what?

1328
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:23,867
What do you see?

1329
01:13:23,867 --> 01:13:28,105
You mean the wall?

1330
01:13:28,105 --> 01:13:31,876
That what you see? A wall?

1331
01:13:31,876 --> 01:13:35,481
Uh-huh.

1332
01:13:35,481 --> 01:13:38,183
That's not what I see.

1333
01:13:41,521 --> 01:13:46,393
'Cause I'm looking through it.

1334
01:13:46,393 --> 01:13:48,229
Past that.

1335
01:13:48,229 --> 01:13:53,869
Like I'm on a road and

1336
01:13:53,869 --> 01:13:58,908
houses to the track.

1337
01:14:01,577 --> 01:14:06,950
And I'm not just walking...

1338
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:07,584
I'm running.

1339
01:14:10,555 --> 01:14:14,993
Look at me.

1340
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,936
Bobby, you said--

1341
01:14:22,936 --> 01:14:24,905
You said the race I'm gonna run

1342
01:14:24,905 --> 01:14:25,939
is out there waiting for me

1343
01:14:27,574 --> 01:14:31,846
to claim it.

1344
01:14:31,846 --> 01:14:35,884
Well, I'm claiming it.

1345
01:14:35,884 --> 01:14:39,421
Right here, right now.

1346
01:14:42,892 --> 01:14:47,898
I'm already running that race.

1347
01:14:47,898 --> 01:14:50,868
Can you see me?

1348
01:14:54,039 --> 01:14:55,907
Can you see me, Bobby?

1349
01:14:55,907 --> 01:14:58,377
Yes.

1350
01:15:02,615 --> 01:15:04,618
Know something?

1351
01:15:04,618 --> 01:15:05,953
First time I've been able to see

1352
01:15:05,953 --> 01:15:07,020
through one of those damn

1353
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:11,492
things.

1354
01:15:14,996 --> 01:15:18,200
I'll see you on the other side.

1355
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,302
Yeah.

1356
01:16:32,086 --> 01:16:36,325
Please help us.

1357
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:39,161
Give us your strength.

1358
01:16:51,075 --> 01:16:53,411
Help us to hear your voice.

1359
01:17:50,544 --> 01:17:53,081
Now be careful.

1360
01:17:57,152 --> 01:17:59,121
Here we are.

1361
01:18:05,162 --> 01:18:09,533
That's my girl.

1362
01:18:09,533 --> 01:18:11,235
You see Mr. Johnson peeping out

1363
01:18:11,235 --> 01:18:12,136
the window?

1364
01:18:12,136 --> 01:18:15,840
Where else would he be?

1365
01:18:20,846 --> 01:18:25,752
( overlapping dialogue )

1366
01:18:29,690 --> 01:18:30,424
Which key?

1367
01:18:30,424 --> 01:18:31,358
I can't see without my

1368
01:18:31,358 --> 01:18:34,129
glasses, baby.

1369
01:18:34,129 --> 01:18:35,363
She's not wearing them.

1370
01:18:35,363 --> 01:18:36,298
She doesn't want to wear those

1371
01:18:36,298 --> 01:18:37,199
glasses.

1372
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:38,333
Just--

1373
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:41,637
Here we go.

1374
01:18:41,637 --> 01:18:42,872
It's time we made that peach pie

1375
01:18:42,872 --> 01:18:44,307
for you.

1376
01:18:44,307 --> 01:18:45,441
Oh, I wonder what peaches.

1377
01:18:45,441 --> 01:18:46,477
And a clean kitchen to eat it

1378
01:18:46,477 --> 01:18:47,244
in.

1379
01:18:47,244 --> 01:18:51,181
Okay.

1380
01:19:23,786 --> 01:19:24,921
Hey, hey.

1381
01:19:24,921 --> 01:19:27,357
Hey, Bobby. I'm in here.

1382
01:19:27,357 --> 01:19:31,362
Oh, those are beautiful.

1383
01:19:31,362 --> 01:19:32,263
Who are they for?

1384
01:19:32,263 --> 01:19:33,230
You.

1385
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:37,202
Ha ha. Thank you.

1386
01:19:37,202 --> 01:19:38,403
Where is everybody?

1387
01:19:38,403 --> 01:19:39,037
Called them all up, told them

1388
01:19:39,037 --> 01:19:40,873
not to come.

1389
01:19:40,873 --> 01:19:41,841
What?

1390
01:19:41,841 --> 01:19:43,843
I don't want a party.

1391
01:19:43,843 --> 01:19:45,344
Being alive's enough.

1392
01:19:45,344 --> 01:19:47,314
You got that right.

1393
01:19:47,314 --> 01:19:52,253
( both laugh )

1394
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:57,392
Listen, Gail, I'm real sorry

1395
01:19:57,392 --> 01:19:59,361
about R.J.

1396
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:01,230
R.J. had a right to run.

1397
01:20:01,230 --> 01:20:02,364
I've been running from him for

1398
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:03,566
long enough.

1399
01:20:03,566 --> 01:20:05,969
Would you like some iced tea?

1400
01:20:05,969 --> 01:20:08,338
Yeah.

1401
01:20:08,338 --> 01:20:11,375
I made some for you special.

1402
01:20:27,794 --> 01:20:31,532
Bobby, I'm gonna be fine.

1403
01:20:31,532 --> 01:20:32,399
I'm gonna live with this for the

1404
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:34,369
rest of my life.

1405
01:20:34,369 --> 01:20:35,403
But the medicine's gonna keep it

1406
01:20:35,403 --> 01:20:38,840
under control.

1407
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:42,044
Keep me from having a relapse.

1408
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:48,285
Bobby, I want to go to

1409
01:20:48,285 --> 01:20:49,419
Barcelona.

1410
01:20:49,419 --> 01:20:51,321
No problem, I'll get you box

1411
01:20:51,321 --> 01:20:53,925
seats.

1412
01:20:53,925 --> 01:20:57,795
Back side.

1413
01:20:57,795 --> 01:21:02,434
Where's the sugar?

1414
01:21:29,867 --> 01:21:30,801
Bobby, I want to run in

1415
01:21:30,801 --> 01:21:33,904
Barcelona.

1416
01:21:33,904 --> 01:21:35,940
I'm going to the Games.

1417
01:21:42,048 --> 01:21:44,350
You sure?

1418
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:48,455
I'm sure.

1419
01:21:48,455 --> 01:21:53,828
You know, Barcelona is

1420
01:21:53,828 --> 01:21:56,097
only 18 months away.

1421
01:21:56,097 --> 01:21:59,034
The trials are no more than a

1422
01:21:59,034 --> 01:22:00,536
year away.

1423
01:22:00,536 --> 01:22:04,708
I know.

1424
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:07,110
Are you sure you know?

1425
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:08,545
Remember when I told you

1426
01:22:08,545 --> 01:22:09,713
about my star?

1427
01:22:09,713 --> 01:22:10,948
I said God took it away.

1428
01:22:10,948 --> 01:22:12,550
Yeah.

1429
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:14,919
Well, I'm taking it back.

1430
01:22:14,919 --> 01:22:17,589
It's mine and I want it.

1431
01:22:17,589 --> 01:22:21,026
What about your feet?

1432
01:22:21,026 --> 01:22:22,729
Like you say, Bobby, what do

1433
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:24,530
my feet have to do with

1434
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:25,164
running?

1435
01:22:25,164 --> 01:22:28,035
No more than flesh on bone.

1436
01:22:28,035 --> 01:22:33,073
Just flesh on bone.

1437
01:22:41,684 --> 01:22:45,421
( grunts )

1438
01:22:58,737 --> 01:23:02,841
( panting )

1439
01:23:08,481 --> 01:23:10,885
Bobby, I-- I can't.

1440
01:23:10,885 --> 01:23:12,153
Sure you can. Come on, try.

1441
01:23:12,153 --> 01:23:12,953
No, Bobby, I thought

1442
01:23:12,953 --> 01:23:13,721
I could.

1443
01:23:13,721 --> 01:23:14,789
Okay.

1444
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:18,493
But I can't.

1445
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,162
Know what I'm thinking about?

1446
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:22,064
I remember the first time

1447
01:23:22,064 --> 01:23:24,534
I ever saw you race.

1448
01:23:24,534 --> 01:23:27,503
It was high school. 1984.

1449
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:28,539
Mmm-hmm.

1450
01:23:28,539 --> 01:23:29,239
Boy, you were something.

1451
01:23:29,239 --> 01:23:30,874
You ran just like a gazelle.

1452
01:23:30,874 --> 01:23:33,110
You were fast furious.

1453
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:34,145
You won that first race by,

1454
01:23:34,145 --> 01:23:36,714
I think, about three inches.

1455
01:23:36,714 --> 01:23:40,085
You must've run 600 miles

1456
01:23:40,085 --> 01:23:42,188
in preparation for that race.

1457
01:23:42,188 --> 01:23:43,556
For three inches.

1458
01:23:43,556 --> 01:23:45,224
Hmmm.

1459
01:23:45,224 --> 01:23:47,561
Think you got three inches now?

1460
01:23:47,561 --> 01:23:52,834
Let's see those three inches.

1461
01:23:52,834 --> 01:23:54,869
Three inches.

1462
01:23:54,869 --> 01:24:00,075
Hmm? You can do that.

1463
01:24:00,075 --> 01:24:01,610
( gasps )

1464
01:24:01,610 --> 01:24:02,845
Hot dog! Whoo!

1465
01:24:02,845 --> 01:24:04,914
( laughs )

1466
01:24:04,914 --> 01:24:06,683
You remember the first time

1467
01:24:06,683 --> 01:24:10,054
you ran for me at S.C., right?

1468
01:24:10,054 --> 01:24:12,957
I must've run you 800 miles

1469
01:24:12,957 --> 01:24:14,592
in preparation.

1470
01:24:14,592 --> 01:24:15,559
You won that race by, I think,

1471
01:24:15,559 --> 01:24:19,865
by about four inches, right?

1472
01:24:19,865 --> 01:24:24,770
Yeah, four inches.

1473
01:24:24,770 --> 01:24:27,540
There. Four inches.

1474
01:24:36,851 --> 01:24:38,019
You just keep remembering

1475
01:24:38,019 --> 01:24:38,953
Barcelona!

1476
01:24:38,953 --> 01:24:42,625
( inaudible dialogue )

1477
01:24:42,625 --> 01:24:46,563
( motivational music )

1478
01:24:54,705 --> 01:24:56,574
Hold it. Barcelona.

1479
01:24:56,574 --> 01:25:01,079
( no audible dialogue )

1480
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:04,651
Barcelona.

1481
01:25:04,651 --> 01:25:06,286
Do it again.

1482
01:25:06,286 --> 01:25:08,121
Do it again.

1483
01:25:08,121 --> 01:25:11,625
( motivational music )

1484
01:25:23,906 --> 01:25:27,343
( no audible dialogue )

1485
01:25:40,693 --> 01:25:43,796
All right. All right.

1486
01:25:43,796 --> 01:25:45,765
Let's go! It's Barcelona!

1487
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:48,802
( engines roar )

1488
01:26:02,651 --> 01:26:06,055
( crowd cheers )

1489
01:26:17,135 --> 01:26:19,204
Next up is the first of the

1490
01:26:19,204 --> 01:26:20,839
preliminary heats of the Women's

1491
01:26:20,839 --> 01:26:22,008
100 Meters.

1492
01:26:22,008 --> 01:26:23,809
Now, Gwen Torrance is due

1493
01:26:23,809 --> 01:26:25,111
to race the last heat.

1494
01:26:25,111 --> 01:26:27,079
But this first heat has the

1495
01:26:27,079 --> 01:26:28,715
surprising presence of one young

1496
01:26:28,715 --> 01:26:29,349
lady, I'm talking about

1497
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:31,351
Gail Devers!

1498
01:26:31,351 --> 01:26:32,719
Absolutely right.

1499
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:33,788
Ladies and gentlemen at home,

1500
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:34,856
it's not a ghost you see on the

1501
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:37,125
screen, but it's Gail Devers

1502
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,359
in the flesh.

1503
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:39,995
She's back, she's ready to run.

1504
01:26:39,995 --> 01:26:42,164
But the question is, can she run

1505
01:26:42,164 --> 01:26:43,766
against this world class field

1506
01:26:43,766 --> 01:26:44,700
in the presence of Gwen

1507
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:45,869
Torrance.

1508
01:26:45,869 --> 01:26:47,704
Gail Devers is in lane 5.

1509
01:26:47,704 --> 01:26:48,872
The main competition this heat

1510
01:26:48,872 --> 01:26:50,173
will come from Cuthbert of

1511
01:26:50,173 --> 01:26:51,842
Jamaica in lane 4.

1512
01:26:51,842 --> 01:26:52,910
And from Privalova from the

1513
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:54,478
Unified Team in lane 6.

1514
01:26:54,478 --> 01:26:55,946
They're both excellent runners,

1515
01:26:55,946 --> 01:26:57,849
and right on either side of her.

1516
01:26:57,849 --> 01:27:00,218
Well, there's Gwen Torrance

1517
01:27:00,218 --> 01:27:02,854
sizing up her competition.

1518
01:27:02,854 --> 01:27:06,159
I'd say.

1519
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:08,494
Not a good start for Devers,

1520
01:27:08,494 --> 01:27:09,997
but it is a strong start out

1521
01:27:09,997 --> 01:27:11,899
of the blocks for Cuthbert.

1522
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:13,067
Devers and Privalova running

1523
01:27:13,067 --> 01:27:13,901
second and third.

1524
01:27:15,269 --> 01:27:17,806
And the top three, Cuthbert,

1525
01:27:17,806 --> 01:27:20,275
Devers and Privalova moving on

1526
01:27:20,275 --> 01:27:24,447
to the finals.

1527
01:28:04,794 --> 01:28:07,864
( cheers and applause )

1528
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:16,341
Bobby.

1529
01:28:16,341 --> 01:28:17,442
There's something I wanna say

1530
01:28:17,442 --> 01:28:20,812
before the race, you know.

1531
01:28:20,812 --> 01:28:22,815
I wanted to-- damn!

1532
01:28:22,815 --> 01:28:26,118
I'm not good at this.

1533
01:28:26,118 --> 01:28:28,889
( cheering )

1534
01:28:28,889 --> 01:28:30,190
I just wanna tell you, Gail--

1535
01:28:30,190 --> 01:28:35,530
Bobby.

1536
01:28:35,530 --> 01:28:39,534
I'll see you on the other side.

1537
01:28:43,505 --> 01:28:48,878
Gail Devers.

1538
01:28:48,878 --> 01:28:51,014
I see your life in my mind.

1539
01:28:51,014 --> 01:28:52,917
It's on tape in my head.

1540
01:28:52,917 --> 01:28:54,451
I play it every day.

1541
01:28:54,451 --> 01:28:56,420
I rewind it, and I play it

1542
01:28:56,420 --> 01:28:57,354
again.

1543
01:28:57,354 --> 01:28:58,857
And when I put it on pause,

1544
01:28:58,857 --> 01:29:04,330
I stand back in awe.

1545
01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:08,234
Gail, you're a champion.

1546
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:16,911
Get going, Gail. Come on.
