# Just as long as I'll be your girl... #

7
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,900
I am really feelin' this new do.

8
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,631
You know, I've never done bangs before.

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,570
They really compliment my face.
Don't you think?

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,370
Oh, no, no.
That's way too expensive.

11
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:45,138

15
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,549
How about some lip, sweetie?

16
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,022
# Remember lying awake #

17
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,423
# Prayin' for a man like you #

18
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:05,089
# Wishin' my fantasies

19
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:09,727
# I wanted someone
who'd appreciate the things I do #

20
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:12,067
# I finally found my baby #

21
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:13,298
# And that is you #

22
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,365
# Fallin' for you, yeah... #

23
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,240
Mmmwah!

24
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,737
Workin' it! Ha ha ha!

25
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:25,114

34
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:50,304
I look fabulous.

36
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:54,678

Show time.

46
00:02:14,234 --> 00:02:16,634
#... just as long as
I'll be your girl #

47
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:19,934
# Mmm, do you even know #

48
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:22,770
# That I think about you constantly? #

49
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:25,936
# Baby, realize I'm all the woman #

50
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:27,877
# That you'll ever need #

51
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,380
# Let me show you #

52
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,282
# Just how cool
I think our thing could be #

53
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,616
# All I want is your good lovin', whoo #

54
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,918
# I'm fallin' for you #

55
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,323
# For the things that you do #

# Make me feel like
I'm one with the world... #

57
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,293
You never stop, do you?

58
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,663
Ooh.

59
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,163
Gotta look good for the clients.

60
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:54,001
I want you to save some energy for me...

61
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:55,301
for later.

62
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,535
Ha ha.

63
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,702
Oh, damn.

64
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,075
I totally forgot.

65
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,545
I gotta meet with Andrea later.

66
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:02,979
That bitch.

67
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,212
Relax, baby. She's just a client.

68
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,151
It's only business.

69
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,554
She does not think of me that way.

70
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,184
She'd like to use your face
as an exercise bike.

71
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,285
You do want me to be successful,
don't you?

72
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,886
Sure.

73
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,455
Good. Listen...

74
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:24,401
tomorrow afternoon, after yoga.

75
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,994
- Yeah.
- OK.

76
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:30,307
- Ohh.
- Ooh.

77
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,400
Whoa.

78
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,537
That was fabulous.

79
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,047
Heh.

80
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:38,675
Now I know how you stay
in such good shape.

81
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,776
Oh, you're in great shape yourself.

82
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,150
Compliments of you.

83
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,349
Uh-huh. Darryl does a body good.

84
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:45,652
Yes, you do.

85
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,626
Now, look,
you know I'm in the gym today.

86
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,094
I'm gonna schedule you
for a real workout.

87
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:52,996
Heh. What do you think
<i>that</i> was?

88
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,727
Ha ha ha.

89
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,996
Ooh. Mmm.

90
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,800
You know, Darryl...

91
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:04,275
I used to walk in a room,
and all the men would look.

92
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,040
I was such a knockout. Ooh.

93
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:10,707
You still are.

94
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:11,772
Thank you.

95
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,342
I want to come over there
and bite that ass.

96
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,980
Heh. You better leave my ass alone.

97
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:20,025
I have a love scene tomorrow,
and I don't need it all chewed up.

98
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,424
Can't I just get a little nibble?

99
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:22,893
No.

100
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,862
Tell me something, Darryl.

101
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,525
Are you still doing Lauren?

102
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,093
I told you... she's just a client.

103
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:35,766
Yeah. She's a client, I'm a client...

104
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:37,571
we're all just clients. Heh.

105
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,612
You must think I'm incredibly stupid.

106
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,409
Andrea, we have been over this.

107
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,245
Whatever.

108
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,875
Now, back to me.

109
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,420
Now, I need you to be honest
with me, Darryl.

110
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,423
Am I losing it? Hmm?

111
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,459
Hell no!

112
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,823
Good.

113
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:55,883
You are impeccable.

114
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,554
- Heh heh heh.
- Superb!

115
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,120
Stupendous!

116
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,290
Mm-hmm.

117
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:03,927
You are all that and a bowl of chips.

118
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,836
I give you... four stars.

119
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,938
It's a <i>bag</i> of chips.

120
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:12,773
You make me sound like a restaurant.

121
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:15,741
Well...

122
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,907
Four stars.

123
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:21,682
Perhaps it's time I revisited
this particular restaurant.

124
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,188
I do believe I have a reservation.

125
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,849
Watch the hair.

126
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:27,790
Kitchen's closed.

127
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,527
How about the drive-thru?

128
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,619
Freeze.

129
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,563
I've got a gun,
and I know how to use it...

130
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:15,039
so put your hands up in the air
where I can see them.

131
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,103
I guess it's true what they say...

132
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,375
about returning
to the scene of the crime.

133
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:24,848
But did you really think...

134
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,408
you were gonna get away
with this twice?

135
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:33,558
Now, before I call the police...

136
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,184
let me get a look at you.

137
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:37,889
Turn around. Take off the hood.

138
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,199
Now, this is a surprise.

139
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,674
Now, what's that number again?

140
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,838
Oh, yeah. 9-1-1.

141
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,439
No, wait. Please don't make that call.

142
00:06:57,517 --> 00:06:59,815
We're both adults here.

143
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:01,547
Can't we work something out?

144
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,885
Like what?

145
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,622
Nice.

146
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,455
Very nice.

147
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:20,205
Very nice indeed.

148
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,710
But just watch it with that gun.

149
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,647
Oh, I'm watching it, all right.

150
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:32,684
And that's not my gun.

151
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,390
Uhh!

152
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,458
Cut!

153
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,436
- Good? Ha ha ha!
- All right.

154
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:54,905
Good take, good take.
Ha ha. How was I?

155
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,498
You guys are great.
You guys are great.

156
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,908
All right, that's lunch.
This is lunch.

157
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,912
That's enough.
Where's my robe?

158
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,625
- So, Lydia...
- Mm-hmm?

159
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,189
What's the big news?

160
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:25,431
Just a little Paramount calling me,
and I've got the hook-up.

161
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,439
You've got my attention.

162
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,773
Well, I have got you a meeting
for a major role...

163
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,311
- Yes! Yes!
- Uh-huh...

164
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,779
In the film version of <i>The Smurfs.</i>

165
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,009
<i>- The Smurfs?</i>
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

166
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,314
Lydia, do I look like a smurf to you?

167
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:43,355
I told you that I wanted to stretch,
not shrink.

168
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:46,516
Girlfriend, we are talking
major bling-bling here.

169
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,718
How major?

170
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,865
Ba-ling and ba-ling! Ha ha ha!

171
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,199
You know, I always thought
those smurfs were real cute.

172
00:08:58,271 --> 00:09:00,637
I could rock that hat, right? Pow!

173
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,798
Whoo! Boy...

174
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,171
Wouldn't mind the color blue, either.

175
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,800
You'd look great.

176
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,742
It's a good shade for me. Mm-hmm.

177
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:10,145
And on top of that, guess
who will be directing this little movie.

178
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,740
- Who?
- Oh, I don't know.

179
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,081
Maybe Mr. Spike Lee.

180
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:16,485
Spike Lee is gonna be directing
<i>The Smurfs?</i>

181
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,547
Oh, it is going to be off the chain.

182
00:09:18,624 --> 00:09:21,058
OK, OK, all right. What else?

183
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,719
Oh, the network keeps calling.

184
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:26,458
They really want you in a series,
and they will not take no for an answer.

185
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,022
That last script was awful.

186
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,068
Oh, it was horrible.
It was wack. I know.

187
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,537
But this time,
they've got kind of a new concept.

188
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:34,698
What is it?

189
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:39,234
They would like for you to play
a recently divorced housewife.

190
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,610
Oh, come on. Two kids... that's it.

191
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:44,582
How old are the kids?
I'm not trying to look old.

192
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,674
- No!
- Honey, I'm Andrea.

193
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,219
- You are.
- Fabulous, young, fresh, mwah!

194
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,585
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- And it stays that way, OK?

195
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,783
So I'm sure I could get it down to,
what, kindergarten.

196
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,325
OK, well, what about the script?

197
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:57,885
Mm. It is da bomb.
Oh, it's gonna blow up.

198
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,261
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

199
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,665
And if this thing
goes into syndication...

200
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,295
oh, you are going to be livin' chilly.

201
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,236
Mm-hmm.
Can I have another drink?

202
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,036
Uh, you better slow down
on the drinks, girlfriend.

203
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,940
That's a margarita, not a slurpee.

204
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,479
Oh, don't worry about me.
It's all gravy.

205
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,711
What is going on with you, though?

206
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,115
Come on, you can tell me.

207
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:24,623
Oh, look, I am not only your agent.
I am also your sista.

208
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:29,320
So come on, tell me. What is really,
really, really, really good with ya?

209
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,590
It's just strange that
we're having lunch at this hotel.

210
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,132
Something happened to me here
a few years ago.

211
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,259
- Ha ha.
- Well, what is it?

212
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,303
A few years ago,
I was seeing someone...

213
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,363
and I had this sneaking suspicion
that he was seeing someone else...

214
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,102
- Mm-hmm?
- I just couldn't prove it.

215
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,473
You don't call me like you used to...

216
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:46,737
- I'm working!
- You're working.

217
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:51,807
Look, baby, I promise you
that you are the only woman in my life.

218
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,843
I just want you to tell me her name!

219
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:59,584
Robert, be a man about it
and tell me the truth.

220
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,183
Andrea, I am telling you the truth.

221
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,627
There is no other woman
in my life except you.

222
00:11:04,697 --> 00:11:09,760
I accidentally stumbled
on some incriminating evidence.

223
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,668
Bingo. Gotcha.

224
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,565
Nice to see you.

225
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:21,477
You, too. You, too.
Thank you. The usual.

226
00:11:21,547 --> 00:11:24,516
Apple martini, bourbon and water.
Up to the room.

227
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,777
On its way.

228
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,651
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:36,524
My boyfriend's cheating on me.
Do you understand?

230
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,654
Nice jacket.

231
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:46,067
So, you just come down from...

232
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,565
You have a guest by the name
of Robert Mitchelson.

233
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,339
Could you please tell me
what room he's in?

234
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:57,212
Madam, I'm afraid it's hotel policy
never to give out that information.

235
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,807
He's in room 235.

236
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,512
- Room 235.
- Yep.

237
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:02,519
- Just down there.
- Thank you.

238
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,056
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,524
235. No, wait.

240
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,060
I'm gonna need a key for that room.

241
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:15,066
Madam, we would never, never...

242
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,262
give out a guest's key
without his permission.

243
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:20,066
Did you want an extra key with that,
or just the one?

244
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,333
- One will be fine.
- OK.

245
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:24,171
- There you are.
- Thank you.

246
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,302
- Enjoy your stay.
- Oh, I will.

247
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,875
Room service.

248
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:35,784
Just leave it.

249
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:38,449
Oh, I'm leaving it, all right.

250
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,220
Oh. Andrea.

251
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,453
Uh...

252
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,088
This is not what it looks like.

253
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,654
Is that right?

254
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:49,292
Do I look blind to you?

255
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,461
Because it looks to me
that you're in a hotel...

256
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,529
waitin' on your ho
to come out and do your business.

257
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,474
Where is she?
Where is the little ho at?

258
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,740
Where is the no-good bitch at?

259
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,706
I am not a ho,
and I ain't nobody's bitch.

260
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,214
Ohh!

261
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,719
I told you you were the only woman.

262
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:16,489
No. No, no, no. You gotta be
kidding me. OK. This is just a dream.

263
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,622
Somebody needs to come
and wake me up!

264
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,756
Robert...

265
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,132
now, it is bad enough
that your girlfriend...

266
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,104
has turned out to be a boyfriend...

267
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,765
but he's even wearing my robe!

268
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:32,208
Missy, this is not your robe.
It is not even close.

269
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,009
That's my man, and that's my robe.
I know my robe when I see it.

270
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,776
OK, I want you to call me Crystal...

271
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,477
'cause I want you to be
crystal clear on this...

272
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,146
I designed this robe,
so don't even go there!

273
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,155
Oh, I'm gonna take you there, all right...

274
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,418
Aaaah! Aah!

275
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,652
Mm! Ah!

276
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,718
Andrea Collins! Andrea Collins!

277
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,458
Robert, you did not tell me
you were doing Miss Andrea Collins!

278
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:57,059
Andrea Collins, I am so sorry.
I did not mean to be doing your man.

279
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,104
Let me just tell you,
I have seen all of your films...

280
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,231
and you are
one of my favorite actresses.

281
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:04,469
Thank you. Ha ha.

282
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,807
Andrea Collins,
you're even more beautiful in person...

283
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,177
th-th-than you are on TV.

284
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:11,182
I loved your TV show.

285
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,115
<i>- Loose Ends?</i>
- Yes!

286
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,618
Ooh, girl, you were nasty in that one.

287
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,211
- Wasn't I?
- Ooh!

288
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,889
And I watched every episode.
I even saw the reruns.

289
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,895
Well, that's great. Heh. Great.

290
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,022
So, you really designed these robes?

291
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:27,963
Oh, yes, girl. I designed this robe.

292
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,762
I found the fabric, the Chinese satin...

293
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:33,532
I even found a Chinaman.
He had two colors... black and cherry.

294
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:35,540
I put 'em together
and made black cherry!

295
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,802
Oh, no, child. Put that up.

296
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,366
Oh, I'm so sorry, baby.

297
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,071
Oh! Ooh!

298
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,170
I love your coat!

299
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:43,715
Oh, this old thing?

300
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:45,306
Excuse me! Andrea...

301
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,544
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

302
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,246
- Now, back to me...
- Yes?

303
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,753
So, whatever happened to Robert?

304
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:50,880
Heh. Robert?

305
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,220
Heh.
I kicked his cheatin' butt to the curb.

306
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,385
Oh, well, props to you, girlfriend.
All right.

307
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,361
- He deserved it.
- Yes, he did.

308
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,828
Whoo, he was bad news, huh?

309
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,866
Mm. What about that other guy?

310
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:01,900
- Who, Dennis?
- Yeah.

311
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,231
- I hired him.
- What? You're kidding.

312
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,203
He became my designer,
and we went into business together.

313
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,261
Sure did.

314
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:09,000
Whoo! I love that. Ha ha ha!

315
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,905
The moral of that story is...

316
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,910
another boyfriend
will always come around.

317
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,445
But a hot stylist?

318
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:15,844
Child, hard to find.

319
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,212
Ooh, you go, girl!

320
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:18,477
Ooh.

321
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,917
Lydia?
Why don't you let me drive you home?

322
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,818
Oh, honey, no. I didn't drive my car.

323
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:26,357
Mm-mm. Didn't you peep my ride?

324
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,450
That is not your limo.

325
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,461
It is my limo.

326
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,259
Cost me a lot of cheddar, but it's mine.

327
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:37,029
Oh, I know that you have gotta slide
to the left side, OK?

328
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,866
But I am having a party
next week at my crib.

329
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,907
Why don't you come by
so we can kick it?

330
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:43,441
All right. You know I'll be there.

331
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,875
Good.
Oh. If you need anything, you holla.

332
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,470
Or better yet, hit me on my celly.

333
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:49,912
- Hit you on your celly.
- Mm-hmm.

334
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,416
Lydia, when did you
become so street, huh?

335
00:15:52,484 --> 00:15:55,351
Oh, sweetheart,
I've been into hip-hop for years.

336
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,286
Yeah, you know,
I'm down with the culture.

337
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,948
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

338
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:00,286
Like to keep it gangsta.

339
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,951
Well, give me a pound on that, girl.

340
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:03,085
- OK, here we go.
- Mm-hmm.

341
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:04,629
- Uh, uh...
- Oh, yeah.

342
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,824
- Keep it real, girl.
- Oh, word to you.

343
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,059
- OK? OK?
- Uh-huh.

344
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,397
- Hey, do you have any money?
- Oh. Yeah, I got you.

345
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,862
All right. Well, just give me
some feedback on the callback, OK?

346
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,802
All right. Love you. Mean it.

347
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,840
Thank you for coming.

348
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,568
I couldn't reach my therapist.

349
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,372
Girl, you know we got your back.
So, what happened?

350
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:55,379
He called and broke up with me
on the phone.

351
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,880
He said I was too needy.

352
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,507
That's pathetic.

353
00:16:58,584 --> 00:16:59,915
I mean, what do men want?

354
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:01,680
Girl, it's like catching a cab.

355
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,619
If the light's on and you're not ready...

356
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:06,385
they'll take your ass for a ride
every time.

357
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,188
- Words to live by.
- Hey.

358
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,922
Hey, sorry I'm late. Mwah.

359
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,191
I just had to fire my bartender.

360
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,732
- Joe?
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,291
Damn, I liked him.
He gave me free drinks all the time.

362
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,860
That's exactly why I fired him.

363
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,371
Well, you look great.

364
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,840
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

365
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,469
- God, I need a drink.
- Me, too.

366
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,569
Waiter!

367
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:30,240
- Mm. So, how was your weekend?
- Perfect.

368
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,011
I had my colon cleansed
and then went out on a date.

369
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:34,677
Ohh. Anyone I know?

370
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:38,189
I don't think so. He's very nice.

371
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,349
How romantic.

372
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,325
You know, dating is so confusing.

373
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,724
Mmm, I agree, I agree.

374
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:45,889
Maybe you haven't met the right man yet.

375
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:48,558
Well, I'll say this...

376
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,659
there isn't one man out there...

377
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,603
that I couldn't have if I wanted him.

378
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,402
Ha ha! I don't think men
are that predictable.

379
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,840
I do.

380
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,710
OK. What about... him?

381
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:06,547
Oh, please. Heh. It would take me...

382
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:07,846
two minutes, maybe three.

383
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,751
Heh! Three whole minutes?

384
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,791
You're right. Two. Maybe one.

385
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,258
OK, fine. Him.

386
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:16,294
Ha ha!

387
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,828
- Him?
- Yeah.

388
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:20,729
Let's be real.
That's not even a challenge.

389
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,096
- OK, fine.
- Ha ha!

390
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,532
OK. What about...

391
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,694
- Emily.
- What?

392
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,294
They're all the same.

393
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:30,205
That's a bit simplistic, isn't it?
I mean, they can't all be the same.

394
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:35,745
Well, then, let's find out.

395
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:39,375
What do you ladies say to a wager?

396
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,713
Ooh, what kind of wager?

397
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,310
A simple one.

398
00:18:42,387 --> 00:18:47,154
I say any man can be seduced,
no ifs, ands, or buts.

399
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,353
- Agreed.
- So?

400
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:51,055
Well, think of it as a game.

401
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,394
We pick a man completely at random...

402
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,491
a total stranger, no ties to any of us.

403
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,058
I see where you're going with this.

404
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,128
- I don't.
- Of course you don't.

405
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:03,003
Look, we pick this man together...

406
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,942
and then we each take turns
attempting to seduce him.

407
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:07,342
Who would go first?

408
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:08,845
We draw straws.

409
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,348
And, to make it more interesting...

410
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:15,819
we each have only one night,
one shot, to get the job done.

411
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,288
You're kidding, right?
This is a joke.

412
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,325
But how would we know
who really won?

413
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,552
Hmm. Good question.

414
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:25,893
I mean, none of us would lie,
of course, but still...

415
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:29,127
there needs to be
some kind of visual proof...

416
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:31,635
of the, uh, consummation.

417
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,500
A videotape! I've got a camera.

418
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:34,800
As do I. Emily?

419
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:38,468
Oh, my God! You guys,
what would my therapist say? Uh-uh.

420
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:41,274
You don't have to tell your therapist
everything, do you?

421
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,472
That is the idea.

422
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,540
- What do you think?
- I love it. Ha ha ha ha!

423
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:48,814
Wait a minute. A perfect stranger?
We don't know where he's been.

424
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,479
Well, that's what makes it
so interesting.

425
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,456
I mean, it's intriguing.

426
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,152
If you're not up to it...

427
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:58,196
No, it's not that. It's just... I mean...

428
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:03,565
I got it!
The first one through the door.

429
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,227
That door?

430
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,507
Hmm.
That's pretty random. Why not?

431
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,338
It's gotta be someone.

432
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,776
The first man who comes in...

433
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,144
No. You guys,
we're not gonna do this. Lauren.

434
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:21,051
If you're afraid you'll lose, Emily...

435
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,349
OK, I'm not afraid.

436
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,582
Good.

437
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:27,955
Heh. Fine. OK. I guess.

438
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:30,221
- Great.
- When do we begin?

439
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,992
I say... right now.

440
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,730
# Ohh, yeah, yeah #

441
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:44,339
# See, you're the man of my dreams #

442
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,776
# I sit around
and think my luck is gone #

443
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:50,212
# Then I found you... #

444
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:54,776
- Uh-uh.
- Ooh. Oh, my God.

445
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,582
Oh, no. That's not right.

446
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,249
# You opened up my heart... #

447
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:01,849
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

448
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,088
Single men only.

449
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:05,254
Yeah, I agree.

450
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,594
Yep. Singles only.

451
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,036
Here he comes.

452
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,867
Uh-uh.

453
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:17,798
- That's a do-over.
- Ha ha. Absolutely.

454
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:19,741
Yep. Do-over.

455
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:26,409
Ohh. That's another do-over.

456
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:27,816
- Ohh.
- Mmm.

457
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:29,319
- Definite do-over.
- Agreed.

458
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,719
You see what I'm saying, ladies?

459
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,916
There's not a good man around
when you need one.

460
00:21:32,991 --> 00:21:34,959
- True.
- Mm-hmm.

461
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,518
OK, let's see what happens this time.

462
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,988
Heh.

463
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,931
Can't do nothin' with that.
Strictly dickly over here.

464
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,468
- Ha ha!
- I heard that.

465
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:46,060
Ha ha ha!

466
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,703
Ahh. Well, look here.

467
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:55,844
Ooh.

468
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,220
Sweet.

469
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,314
What do you think? Not bad, huh?

470
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,416
Could be worse. Em?

471
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,461
He's OK. Mm-hmm.

472
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,362
But who is he?

473
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,626
He's a perfect stranger.

474
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:18,002
Not for long.

475
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:25,206
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Oh, don't be sick.

476
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:27,776
You know that guy...

477
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:31,213
She is going to get all the scoop.
Watch and see.

478
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,511
I can't believe we're doing this.

479
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:36,020
Believe it, baby. It'll be good
for your next therapy session.

480
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,988
It's like me
when I play different characters.

481
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:40,786
- Oh, God.
- You get to escape.

482
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,857
Uh-oh. Here she comes.

483
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:47,956
Oh.

484
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:51,125
Hmm.

485
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,262
So, here's the story.

486
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:54,896
His name is Mark Sellers.

487
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:56,804
He's in real estate...

488
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,343
has great style,
so he must have money...

489
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,903
- Mm-hmm?
- And he is single.

490
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:06,041
Heh. That's him. He's the one.

491
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,177
Yep.

492
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:11,051
So... what do we do now?

493
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,647
Ha ha ha!

494
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,351
We draw straws.

495
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,030
Ha ha ha!

496
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,727
Frankly, Emily, I'm disappointed.

497
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:53,526
I mean, this kind of game-playing
seems immature.

498
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,465
It's reckless.
It's possibly dangerous.

499
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:59,732
You know what? I'm sure
we won't even go through with it.

500
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:03,434
I mean, you know,
this is just Andrea being Andrea.

501
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:06,272
Emily,
you and I have accomplished...

502
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:08,812
a great deal
over the past couple of years.

503
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,872
I would hate to see you
diminish this work...

504
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,080
with this irresponsible diversion.

505
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,290
So, when's your turn, hmm?

506
00:24:19,357 --> 00:24:21,416
Last, thank God.

507
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,154
It's Andrea, Lauren, then me.

508
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:26,493
But you know what?
I'm sure they've forgotten all about it.

509
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,926
I look fabulous.

510
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:34,497
- Oh, I am so sorry.
- Oh!

511
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,804
- Let me help you out.
- No problem. I got it, I got it.

512
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,277
I'm such a klutz.

513
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:44,110
Sometimes I don't look where I'm going.

514
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,082
Have we met before?

515
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,244
Did I show you a house, or...

516
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,651
I don't think so.

517
00:24:49,721 --> 00:24:52,451
You're probably right.
I would've remembered.

518
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,685
Me, too.

519
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,991
Listen, I'm sorry for the intrusion.
Can you ever possibly forgive me?

520
00:24:59,064 --> 00:25:02,033
Under one circumstance.

521
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:04,462
And that would be?

522
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,266
You let me buy you a drink.

523
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,804
How about dinner?

524
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,672
Dinner it is.

525
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:14,211
I won't hold you up.
Here's my number.

526
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,478
Call me.

527
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,718
Whoo!

528
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:42,038
Next thing I know, someone offered me
more for the house than I paid for it.

529
00:25:42,107 --> 00:25:44,234
Sold that one, bought another one...

530
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,277
fixed it up, sold that one, too.

531
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,904
Mmm. That's fascinating.

532
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,072
Ha ha.

533
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:52,708
So, tell me, Mark...

534
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:56,015
a guy like you... handsome, wealthy...

535
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,384
I'm hardly either.

536
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,320
Oh, come on. Don't be modest.

537
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,382
Heh. You're quite a catch.

538
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:04,826
Ever been married?

539
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,761
Engaged?

540
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,356
Uh, I was engaged once.

541
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:10,492
Really?

542
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,538
Yeah. It seems like a long time ago,
but it wasn't, really.

543
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:15,129
Well, I don't mean to pry, but...

544
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,436
No, it's OK. It's cool.

545
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:21,104
I should talk about it,
'cause for a long time, I really couldn't.

546
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:22,168
Hmm.

547
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,875
Um, we had made
all the arrangements.

548
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,542
It was a week before the wedding...

549
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:27,880
but something was wrong.

550
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:30,854
- It just didn't feel right, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

551
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,720
At first, I kind of wrote it off
as pre-wedding jitters.

552
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,350
Oh, I mean, it happens.
It's not uncommon.

553
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,394
No problem.

554
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:39,726
But as we got closer to the weekend,
it got worse.

555
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,665
So I asked Melinda...
that's my fiancée at the time...

556
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:43,928
I'm, like, "Baby, what's wrong?"

557
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,560
- And...
- And?

558
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,538
It turns out that she was
seeing somebody on the side.

559
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,097
What?

560
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,699
And she was still in love with him.

561
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,970
Mm.

562
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:56,707
So, uh, she was very apologetic
about it, but she called it off.

563
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,510
She said it wouldn't be fair to me.

564
00:26:58,583 --> 00:26:59,982
Who was the guy?

565
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:02,786
My best friend.

566
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,287
Damn.

567
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,052
That's what I said.

568
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,094
I mean, that girl was crazy,
if you ask me.

569
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:11,822
She made a big mistake.

570
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:12,954
You don't have to say that.

571
00:27:13,031 --> 00:27:14,521
- It's true.
- But thanks.

572
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:16,066
You're welcome.

573
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:19,763
This is the first real date I've been on
since I can remember.

574
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,636
- Listen, Mark...
- Yeah.

575
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,436
I know what it's like to feel pain.

576
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,838
What happened to you...
nobody can make it up to you.

577
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:33,282
But... I’m hoping you'll let me try.

578
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:42,585
And... this is my bedroom.

579
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,322
Nice, nice. Heh heh.

580
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,556
Thank you.

581
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,927
Uh, do you mind
if I use your bathroom?

582
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,192
Oh, sure. It's right through there.

583
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,494
Thanks.

584
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:10,111
Andrea, you've done well.

585
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,520
Oh, ha ha. You like?

586
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,148
Yes.

587
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,693
Why don't you come
make yourself more comfortable?

588
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:19,525
I'll be right back.

589
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,724
Hey, do you mind
if I turn on some music?

590
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,927
Sure, go right ahead.

591
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:26,334
Andrea. Heh.

592
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:30,898
Andrea, Andrea, Andrea, Andrea.

593
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,906
This girl definitely loves herself.

594
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,554
Whew!

595
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,415
Mmm.

596
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,461
Andrea, you are...

597
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:52,723
one special kind of lady.

598
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,736
Hello.

599
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,367
Hi.

600
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,571
I missed you.

601
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:12,742
And I couldn't wait.

602
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:15,251
Mmm. The thing is,
I'm just a little nervous.

603
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,810
I hate to rush things...

604
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:19,015
but ever since we met,
you're all I can think about.

605
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,114
Really?

606
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,283
Do you want me?

607
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,226
Oh, yes. God, yes. Are you kidding?

608
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:26,263
Then why do you still
have on your clothes?

609
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,356
Good question.

610
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,094
I want you to strip for me.

611
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:32,136
- Really?
- Yeah.

612
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:33,465
- Right now?
- Yeah.

613
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,339
Let's work it.

614
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,934
Don't be scared.

615
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,315
Work it.

616
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,987
Work it, yeah. Work it.

617
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,021
Oh, yeah.

618
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,293
That's it.

619
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:03,459
- Like this?
- Yeah.

620
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,866
You want me to, like, grind on it?

621
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,062
- Work it. Work it.
- Ooh.

622
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,161
Ohh, like this?

623
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,502
Yeah, roundabout. Roundabout.

624
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:11,565
Yeah.

625
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,338
Go, Mark. Hey!

626
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,810
Oh. Oh, that's good.

627
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,574
Look at them abs, baby. Yeah!

628
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,242
Ha ha ha! Yeah.

629
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:21,578
Drop your back, baby.

630
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,642
Ohh!

631
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,017
Work it, Mark. Just work it.

632
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:25,385
Get into it. Yeah. That's it.

633
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:26,980
That's it. Ohh...

634
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,686
Ohh, what? Huh?

635
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,353
Go, Mark.

636
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,760
I feel it. I feel it. I like it.

637
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,766
You feel it? Yeah. Ha ha ha!

638
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,233
You got the freak in you!

639
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,667
Whoo! Shake it, baby.

640
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:41,068
Shake it. Shake it. Shake it.

641
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,163
- Uhh!
- Yeah!

642
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,765
How is it? Is it workin'? Uhh!

643
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,811
Drop it. Come on, baby.

644
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:48,368
You want to see somethin'? Ohh.

645
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:49,811
Go, Mark.

646
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,371
Mm-mm-mm. Mm.

647
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:52,541
- Want some?
- Yeah, shake it.

648
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:53,879
Shake it.

649
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,010
Drop it, baby! Whoo!

650
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,212
Ow!

651
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:57,276
- Spank it!
- Ow!

652
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,153
- Hurt myself!
- Yeah!

653
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,523
Shake it. Ohh.

654
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:04,854
- Ohh!
- Ha ha!

655
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:08,296
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Ha ha! OK.

656
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,458
- You like that.
- Yeah.

657
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,593
Uh-oh. Drop it!

658
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:14,496
- Drop for me!
- Ooh!

659
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:15,869
You all right?

660
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,703
But I'm back.

661
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,538
That's it. Ride the pony for me.

662
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:22,171
Come on. Work that wall.
Work the wall. Yeah.

663
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:23,578
You like that?
This is you, Andrea.

664
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,343
Pow! Ohh!

665
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:26,440
Oh, that's good.

666
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:27,745
That's how I'm gonna drop it on you.

667
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,912
I'm tappin' it. I'm gonna tap it.

668
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,012
Ohh!

669
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,681
Oh, that's good.

670
00:31:32,757 --> 00:31:34,884
Oh, that's it right there, Mark.

671
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:36,859
I'm gonna drop it on you.

672
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:39,419
Yeah. Then I'm gonna
back it up on you like that.

673
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,829
Yeah. Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

674
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,924
Ow!

675
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,229
Can you shake it like a polaroid?

676
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:45,701
Shake it, shake it.

677
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,828
Shake it.

678
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,702
Shake it, shake it.

679
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,434
That's it.

680
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:56,079
Shake it. Work it. Work it.
Work it. Work it.

681
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:58,775
I'm on it. Here I come.

682
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,010
I'm bringin' the thunder.

683
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,415
- Bring it.
- Uhh.

684
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:05,081
Shake it. Go, Mark. Go, Mark.

685
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:06,282
Go, Mark.

686
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:07,881
Aah!

687
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:14,556
Mark?

688
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:17,465
Who's your daddy? Who's your daddy?
Who's your daddy? Who's your da... huh?

689
00:32:17,535 --> 00:32:19,230
I've got an early call tomorrow.

690
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,828
Oh, oh, oh, OK.

691
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:22,236
You want me to leave now?

692
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,365
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

693
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:27,605
Look, I had a great time,
but I gotta get my beauty rest, you know?

694
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,805
Close-ups.

695
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,316
And with you here,
I won't be able to get much sleep.

696
00:32:32,383 --> 00:32:34,977
- Right. Um, maybe we can, uh...
- I'll call you.

697
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:37,146
- Well, I was wondering...
- No, really. I'll call you.

698
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,449
Oh, OK.

699
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,958
What the hell?

700
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,895
Man...

701
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,870
Ha ha ha!

702
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,031
Show time!

703
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,597
Ha ha ha!

704
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,280
Come on.

705
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,444
What the hell?
Oh, no. This can't be happening.

706
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,454
I don't believe it!

707
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,423
No-o-o-o!

708
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,360
No! No-o-o-o!

709
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:22,126
No-o-o-o-o!

710
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,189
Shit!

711
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,812
But it's not fair.

712
00:33:38,883 --> 00:33:40,646
I know I rocked his world.

713
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:43,050
Is it my fault
that the camera didn't work?

714
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:47,713
Look, now, we go back since college.

715
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:50,625
Can't you take my word for it?

716
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,128
Em...

717
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,096
Come on, aren't we friends?

718
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,895
Where is the love here?

719
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,903
All right, fine. Be that way.

720
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,563
I'm going to remember that though.

721
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:02,731
You said it yourself.

722
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:06,402
No tape, no proof, no dice... you lose.

723
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:07,910
It's a stupid rule.

724
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,038
So, what was he like?

725
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:13,880
Let's just say he's very... sensitive.

726
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,213
Was he nice?

727
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:16,810
I don't have anything else to say.

728
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,186
Come on, Andrea, we're not the enemy.

729
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,851
You know what?
I say we call the whole thing off...

730
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:23,086
before we go any farther.

731
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,095
Look, I didn't go through all that
for nothing.

732
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:29,259
- Well, at least you got some.
- Big deal.

733
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:30,661
Hello, ladies.

734
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,669
- Hey, Darryl.
- Hey, Darryl.

735
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,897
Oh, that's right.
You two know each other.

736
00:34:35,973 --> 00:34:38,669
Yes, we do.

737
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,675
- Andrea.
- Mm-hmm.

738
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,408
Ooh.
I didn't forget about you, Lauren.

739
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,143
- Hey.
- Hi.

740
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,084
Love the changes.

741
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:54,056
The new decor looks great.

742
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,114
I don't believe we've met.

743
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:57,555
This is our good friend Emily.

744
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,791
Well, Emily...

745
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:02,730
have we met?

746
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,860
Us? No. I don't think so.

747
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,098
I just can't help but feel
that we've met before.

748
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:11,107
That's because you try
to meet every woman in L.A.

749
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:15,945
I don't mean to interrupt.

750
00:35:16,013 --> 00:35:17,310
I'm meeting somebody for lunch.

751
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:21,646
A new client.

752
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,879
Right.

753
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,717
I shouldn't keep her waiting.

754
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,121
Well, Emily, it is a pleasure.

755
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,319
Here's my card...

756
00:35:30,394 --> 00:35:33,227
in case you ever want to get in shape.

757
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,992
Please.

758
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,796
- Bye, Darryl.
- Bye.

759
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,029
Oh, my.

760
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,094
He certainly is something.

761
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,265
He's something, all right.

762
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:46,936
Well, all right, Miss Lauren.
It's your turn.

763
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,275
It's not going to be as easy as you think.

764
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,077
We'll just see about that, won't we?

765
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:57,982
I don't understand.

766
00:35:58,055 --> 00:36:00,649
I mean, you said that they did it,
but they can't prove it?

767
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,317
Andrea swears they had sex...

768
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,793
but the camera
malfunctioned or something.

769
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:06,887
Which means she loses.

770
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:10,456
Yeah. And I would've bet on Andrea.
She's so determined.

771
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,969
Well, let me just ask you.
Who's up next? Is it Lauren?

772
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,335
Yes.
I have no doubts about Lauren.

773
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,136
She's a sexy successful
businesswoman.

774
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:19,767
He'll find her irresistible.

775
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,937
- And what about you?
- What about me?

776
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,948
- Well, how will he find you?
- I don't know.

777
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,315
And how will you feel
if you lose, right?

778
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,854
And what if you win, and she wins?
What if there's a tie?

779
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,117
I mean, is there some sort of a runoff?

780
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,488
- I don't know.
- Well, you need to figure it out.

781
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,155
Well, I don't know,
but I hired a private investigator.

782
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,322
You what?

783
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,298
Mm-hmm.
I hired someone to do some digging.

784
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,391
You did not.

785
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:47,062
That's good. That's very...
That's very smart.

786
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:51,731
- I'm feeling an intense guilt.
- Mm-hmm.

787
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,709
So, I think you were right.

788
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:57,976
It's irresponsible. I'm not a child.
I'm calling the whole thing off.

789
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,176
Oh, no, you are not.
No, you can't do that.

790
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:04,688
What I mean to say is that
by following this thing through a bit...

791
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:07,883
if it might not be
the most constructive path to take.

792
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:08,948
Constructive?

793
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:12,826
In that you have always had
a problem finishing things.

794
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,092
You're right. I... I'm curious.

795
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:18,033
- Mm-hmm.
- I do want to meet him.

796
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:19,592
I must be crazy.

797
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,934
Oh, no, honey.
You know we don't use the "C" word.

798
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,439
Sorry.

799
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:24,769
All right, Emily...

800
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,003
All right,
I want to know everything, OK?

801
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:29,876
I'm going to go ahead and give you
my home phone number.

802
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,209
You memorize it. You call me...

803
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:35,275
if there is any new information at all
at any time.

804
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:36,513
Doctor, are you sure?

805
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,885
Yes. Are you kidding?
I'm a professional, OK?

806
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:45,054
You just keep your mind open,
and you keep me informed of everything.

807
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:48,155
All right, Lauren, round two.
Let's go.

808
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:49,699
All right, I know this is your favorite.

809
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,463
Ha ha ha. I am good at it,
I have to admit.

810
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:53,764
Mm-hmm.

811
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,466
All right, well, let's see what you got.

812
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,771
- Let's turn it up.
- Mm-hmm.

813
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,038
- OK.
- You doing OK?

814
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,739
Yeah, good.

815
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,977
My mom likes to go at your pace, too.

816
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,643
Oh, OK. All right.

817
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,415
- Yeah?
- OK.

818
00:38:14,725 --> 00:38:16,386
You're lucky
I can't get you out on that track.

819
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,518
I would just kill you.

820
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,620
Ha ha. That's what you think.

821
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,188
Give me some strong kicks for Darryl.

822
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:24,427
Come on, he deserves it.

823
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:25,662
Yeah. That was a good one.

824
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,795
That was it. Stronger.

825
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,840
Yes. That was great.

826
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:33,673
Yes. All right, that was nice and high,
but that's OK. That was high.

827
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:35,644
- OK.
- All right.

828
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:37,112
Yes.

829
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:41,443
- Ha ha!
- Is that all you got?

830
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,113
Is that all I got? OK.
I'm just warming up.

831
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:49,487
You can do better than that.

832
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,118
OK.

833
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:57,632
Aah!

834
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,135
Lauren?

835
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,016
Mm-mmm.

836
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,928
# So many times
I've pictured you, yeah #

837
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:28,294
Sorry I'm late.

838
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,300
No problem. Any trouble finding it?

839
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,336
No, no. Your directions were great.

840
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:34,496
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

841
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:38,566
Now, this house...

842
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:41,236
# Making words I shouldn't say #

843
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:44,577
# Baby, I'm dreaming about #

844
00:39:44,648 --> 00:39:47,378
# Getting intimate with you #

845
00:39:47,451 --> 00:39:49,851
# Sharing a moment together #

846
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,184
# Can you feel it, too #

847
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,188
# Oh, oh #

848
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,191
# Shouldn't keep it inside #

849
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:57,853
# Couldn't hurt to let you know #

850
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:00,954
# What you're feelin', girl #

851
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:01,998
# Should I let it show #

852
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,432
And here's the fireplace...

853
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,232
which comes complete
with its own dragons.

854
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,264
You are so cute.

855
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,072
Uh... ahem.

856
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,806
How about we go outside?
I want to show you...

857
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,544
the most amazing view of Los Angeles.

858
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,279
# All I got to do is close my eyes #

859
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,652
# And you're next to me, yeah #

860
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:29,625
# Now I question my desire #

861
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:32,594
# Is it just to me inside #

862
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:36,333
# And feel the passion fire #

863
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,130
# Is it more #

864
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,569
# Am I ready to believe #

865
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:43,834
I hope you don't think
I'm being too forward...

866
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,968
I'm sure this happens to you
all the time...

867
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,444
but I was wondering,
if you had a free evening...

868
00:40:49,513 --> 00:40:51,310
I'd love to take you
to a comedy club.

869
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,180
- I love to laugh.
- Great.

870
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,049
Um, I'm free next Saturday,
if that works for you.

871
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:59,783
It works fine.
I guess I should call you.

872
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,621
Oh, here.

873
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,251
Perfect. Saturday night, then.

874
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,853
Mm-hmm. Can't wait.

875
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,228
I'll call you.

876
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,028
# What I never had to tell you #

877
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,728
# You're my fantasy, fantasy #

878
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:13,827
# Tell me why #

879
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:15,667
# All I got to do is close my eyes #

880
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,105
# And you're all that I can see #

881
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:19,107
# Oh, girl #

882
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:20,643
Whoo. Mmm.

883
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:22,645
# You're my fantasy #

884
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,819
# I like the way you do it,
the way you ride #

885
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,691
# I like the way you lock on
to the groove when I'm inside #

886
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:40,320
# I like the way you please #

887
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:41,557
# The way you tease #

888
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,499
# I like the way you're givin' me
exactly what I need #

889
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,001
# I like the way you do it #

890
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,469
# The way you ride #

891
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,803
# I like the way you lock on
to the groove when I'm inside #

892
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:51,933
# I like the way you please #

893
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,000
# The way you tease... #

894
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,340
So, how's your game?

895
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:57,937
You're not going to believe
what's been happening to me, man...

896
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,505
but I know you can appreciate it.

897
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,777
Ohh.

898
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,116
So, this... this whole thing started
about, what, ten days ago, right?

899
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,180
I just closed on this property.
I'm feeling good.

900
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,782
I decided to treat myself to lunch...

901
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,623
at this nice trendy spot on Ocean...
you know...

902
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,662
where your waitress friend
used to work.

903
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,493
We don't have to talk about that.

904
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,965
Cool, because I usually just
grab a sandwich somewhere.

905
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,001
But you were...

906
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:19,160
- celebrating.
- Celebrating.

907
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:20,828
Exactly, my brother.

908
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:27,110
If the light's on...

909
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:29,270
and you're not ready...

910
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:33,908
they will take your ass
for a ride every time, OK?

911
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,383
Words to live by.

912
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:36,476
- Hey.
- Hey.

913
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,816
Sorry I'm late. Mwah!

914
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,549
I just had to fire my bartender.

915
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:40,851
Joe?

916
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,654
- Really?
- Yeah.

917
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,889
- God, I need a drink.
- Oh, me, too.

918
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,157
Waiter!

919
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:50,495
Mmm. I agree, I agree.

920
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,230
Maybe you haven't met
the right man yet.

921
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,363
Well, I'll say this.

922
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,999
There isn't one man out there...

923
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,804
that I couldn't have
if I really wanted him.

924
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,242
What?

925
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,212
I don't think men
are that predictable.

926
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,372
I do.

927
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:08,043
All right, fine. What about... him?

928
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:10,143
- Him?
- Yeah.

929
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,780
Oh, let's be real.
That's not even a challenge.

930
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:13,948
- OK.
- All right.

931
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:16,925
- What about...
- Emily, they're all the same.

932
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:20,327
That's a bit simplistic, isn't it?
I mean, they can't all be the same.

933
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:22,126
Well, let's find out.

934
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:25,134
What do you ladies say to a wager?

935
00:43:25,202 --> 00:43:27,329
- What kind of wager?
- A simple one.

936
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:30,703
I say any man can be seduced,
no ifs, ands, or buts.

937
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,298
Agreed. So?

938
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:33,434
We'll think of it as a game.

939
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:36,502
We pick a man completely at random,
a total stranger...

940
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,946
and we each take turns
attempting to seduce him.

941
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:40,449
And to make it more interesting...

942
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:43,748
we each have only one night,
one shot to get the job done.

943
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:46,619
- Who said that?
- You're kidding, right? This is a joke.

944
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:47,657
I've got it.

945
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,285
The first one through the door.

946
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:51,328
Yeah.

947
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:53,226
That's pretty random. Why not?

948
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,264
So, when do we begin?

949
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:57,596
I say right now.

950
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,076
Aah!

951
00:44:17,254 --> 00:44:21,190
Excuse me! Watch out! Aah!

952
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:24,951
Aw!

953
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:27,361
Whoo! Whew!

954
00:44:32,102 --> 00:44:34,002
- Hey.
- Mr. Sellers.

955
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,471
Hey, you may be approached
by a lady asking about me...

956
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,067
and if you are,
this is what I need you to say.

957
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,738
# I like the way you lock on
to the groove when I'm inside #

958
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:44,212
# I like the way you please #

959
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:45,714
# The way you tease #

960
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,217
# I like the way you're giving me
exactly what I need #

961
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:49,980
Come on, do you think I'm drunk?

962
00:44:50,054 --> 00:44:51,453
You bullshittin', right?

963
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,820
You making all this up to torture me.

964
00:44:53,891 --> 00:44:55,620
Would I lie to you, man?

965
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,354
Hold up. It don't stop there.

966
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:59,760
So, like, a few days go by.

967
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,525
Nothing happens, so I'm figuring...

968
00:45:01,598 --> 00:45:04,965
maybe these ladies had a few
too many martinis, and they forgot.

969
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,002
And then...

970
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,037
- Ooh!
- Oh!

971
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:08,537
- I am so sorry.
- Oh, man.

972
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:11,199
- Let me help you out.
- You know what? No problem. I got it.

973
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:14,711
- OK.
- Oh, I'm such a klutz.

974
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,771
Are you sure it was actually her?
You said you really didn't see them.

975
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:20,045
Believe me,
I managed to get a good look...

976
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,311
when I walked through the front, OK?

977
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,852
It was her for sure.

978
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,787
So, we made a date for dinner,
and as you can imagine...

979
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:28,188
I'm feeling pretty good
about things right now.

980
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:30,089
- Ha ha.
- It's not fair.

981
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,559
What's not fair?

982
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,323
It's happening to you and not me.

983
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:36,161
What can I say? God loves me, J.

984
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,461
Don't play like that.

985
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,058
So, where y'all go?

986
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,570
I took her to this sexy place
on Melrose.

987
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:42,969
I knew she'd like that.

988
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,407
But let me explain.
This woman isn't just beautiful, man.

989
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:47,466
She's radiant.

990
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:50,877
And she's a professional actress,
so she got to be fine.

991
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:52,939
Anyway, she's flirting.

992
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:56,747
She's bumping her leg on my leg
under the table or whatever, you know?

993
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,685
And not enough to be obvious...

994
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,917
but just enough to keep a man
playing close attention.

995
00:46:00,991 --> 00:46:02,015
Right, right, right.

996
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,583
So, this is where
I take it over the top.

997
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:07,289
I make up this story
about my fiancée...

998
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:09,924
and how she dumped me
for my best friend.

999
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,766
And I'm practically in tears,
and I know it's bullshit.

1000
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:15,600
Denzel ain't got nothing on me, dawg.

1001
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:18,266
That's my boy!

1002
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:21,368
So, what happened after dinner?

1003
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,504
Boy, where has the time gone?

1004
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,104
You know, J, I got to get out of here.

1005
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:26,444
Hey, look, look, don't play, OK?

1006
00:46:26,517 --> 00:46:29,042
You ain't going nowhere.
What happened? Tell me.

1007
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,713
She practically ripped my clothes off.

1008
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,620
Uh-uh.

1009
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,681
She came out the bathroom.

1010
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:37,624
She's standing there
in her bra and panties...

1011
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,322
looking like she stepped out
of <i>Victoria's Secret.</i>

1012
00:46:40,397 --> 00:46:41,455
Ooh.

1013
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:44,057
Tyra Banks on steroids,
everything matching.

1014
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,499
Sweet toes.

1015
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,764
Ooh. Sweet toes?

1016
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,966
I'm, like, you know,
"Maybe... Maybe we should wait."

1017
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:53,134
She's, like, "I want you naked now."

1018
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,179
Whoa. And then what?

1019
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:58,510
- You really want to know?
- Yes, I do.

1020
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:01,483
Whew.
How long you been knowing me, man?

1021
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:02,644
A long time.

1022
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,279
And you could say roughly
I'm an experienced guy, right?

1023
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:06,913
Yeah.

1024
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,926
Let me be honest, J. We did things.

1025
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,986
Such as?

1026
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:17,830
- Things.
- What kind of things?

1027
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:20,768
I'm freaked out just
thinking about it right now, man.

1028
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:21,998
Well, try hard.

1029
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:26,509
Let me just say,
we... we invented new positions.

1030
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:29,205
I need to see my chiropractor right now.

1031
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,474
How many?

1032
00:47:31,548 --> 00:47:34,449
Josh, a real gentleman
does not tell his business.

1033
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,509
Then you should have no problem,
Mark.

1034
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:37,918
Whatever.

1035
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:42,049
Anyway, what she didn't know was,
when she went in the bathroom...

1036
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,322
I found the video camera
which I knew would be there.

1037
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:47,056
She hid the camera?

1038
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:50,463
Amazing how devious
some people can be, huh?

1039
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,831
Yeah.

1040
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:53,494
So, I unplugged the video cable.

1041
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:56,368
Are you sure you didn't dream all this?

1042
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,465
Dream? It was real.

1043
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,534
I've already met
bachelorette number two.

1044
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:04,172
She pretended to be
in the market for a house...

1045
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:06,944
so I gave her a guided tour.

1046
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:08,348
Ha ha!

1047
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:11,080
Smart girl.

1048
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,485
So, what did she look like?

1049
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,524
Whoo! Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1050
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,559
- Like that?
- Like that.

1051
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:17,753
Mmm.

1052
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:20,729
- Whew.
- I can't believe it.

1053
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:23,561
- So, when's the next date?
- This Saturday.

1054
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:27,661
I would say, "Wish me luck,"
but there's really no need to...

1055
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:31,538
because as you can see,
I'm doing well. Ha ha!

1056
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:33,974
Don't do that. Don't hate, Jack.

1057
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:37,878
Um, any chance of you and Kim
getting back together?

1058
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:43,446
- Yeah.
- I mean, I don't like being by myself.

1059
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,421
And late at night...

1060
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:47,923
when I'm at home...

1061
00:48:47,991 --> 00:48:50,084
man, I've been overusing
my palm pilot.

1062
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:56,966
Uhh.

1063
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:00,526
I'm serious. I'm starting to get
arthritis in both hands.

1064
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,767
That's too much information, J.
I don't need to know all that, man.

1065
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,240
There's nothing wrong
with pleasuring yourself, Mark.

1066
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,800
Check. Ahem.

1067
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,539
I'm only human, OK?

1068
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,207
And I got sexual needs
that's got to be satisfied.

1069
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,716
Check! Any check, please.

1070
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,049
- I got a callus on this one right here.
- Help!

1071
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:25,493
OK. If you ever fall in love with
a young boy, and he drop you...

1072
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,120
I'm going to tell you
how you get back at him.

1073
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:29,825
Have sex with his father.

1074
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,027
Oh, that'll hurt him, that'll hurt him.

1075
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:34,093
He come home from the club
late one night.

1076
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:35,331
His father got one of them...

1077
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:38,306
old Bobby Womack,
Gene Chandler records on.

1078
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:42,277
He figures Daddy in there having sex
with Sister Jenkins from the church.

1079
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:44,780
That's when I come bouncing out,
look at him...

1080
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:45,974
and go, "Your daddy said
take the garbage out...

1081
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:48,313
before you go to bed."

1082
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:51,684
That'll kill him.

1083
00:49:51,755 --> 00:49:53,188
When he's busy, I'm easy.

1084
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:55,383
You can have sex with me
on the hood of a car.

1085
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,723
You just need to keep the car running,
so my back don't get cold.

1086
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,455
I'm easy like that.

1087
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,794
Mmm! And then, ladies,
you need to fix yourself up.

1088
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:06,267
You need to look good. Why?

1089
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,998
Because when you look good,
you feel good.

1090
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:10,596
Wear some damn makeup.

1091
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,471
I know I got to wear makeup,
because without makeup...

1092
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:14,100
I look exactly like Wesley Snipes.

1093
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,610
Wear some makeup.

1094
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,977
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

1095
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:20,141
Look at the white people going,
"I knew I knew her.

1096
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:23,516
Either she was in <i>Blade,</i> or..."

1097
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:24,815
Ha ha!

1098
00:50:24,888 --> 00:50:26,150
Ladies...

1099
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,657
we need to stop
playing games with our love.

1100
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,920
Y'all know what I'm talking about.
Y'all know what game I'm talking about.

1101
00:50:30,994 --> 00:50:33,827
You go out with a good man.
He a decent man.

1102
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:36,388
You done ate up
all the steak and lobster.

1103
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:38,161
Then when it's time to have sex...

1104
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:41,727
you want to talk about Jesus
and the direction of your life.

1105
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:44,501
You's a trick-ass bitch.

1106
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,110
You know why?
Because you're messing it up...

1107
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:50,806
for decent hos like myself.

1108
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:54,783
See, when a man get his feelings hurt,
he don't change for the better.

1109
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:56,944
He change for the worse...

1110
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:01,218
so when I go out with him,
now he's a bitter bastard.

1111
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:02,849
Now I can barely get...

1112
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:05,588
a Happy Meal and Snicker bar
out this bitter bastard...

1113
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:08,324
and it's all your fault.

1114
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,865
It's not right.

1115
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,663
Stop messing with your man
while he watching TV.

1116
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,328
Give your man his space.

1117
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:18,238
When your man is watching TV,
fix him some snacks and get out the way.

1118
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:21,300
Don't try to talk to your man
while he watching TV.

1119
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:26,281
Never ask your man this question...
"What you thinking 'bout?"

1120
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:29,750
You know why? He can't tell you
what he thinking about...

1121
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,583
when you say,
"What you thinkin' 'bout?"

1122
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:32,679
Because you know
what he want to say?

1123
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,417
"I was thinking
you need to get your ass...

1124
00:51:34,491 --> 00:51:37,085
"out of the front of the damn TV
while I'm trying to watch the game...

1125
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,320
"but I can't say that to you...

1126
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:39,453
"because I'm going to want
to have sex with you...

1127
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:42,054
in about twenty minutes
when the game go off."

1128
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:48,437
Owning a restaurant, that's exciting.

1129
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:49,472
Not always.

1130
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,200
Dealing with the staff...

1131
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:53,708
the chef, waiters,
the busboys, bartenders.

1132
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,109
- Quality is everything.
- Mmm.

1133
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,238
The restaurant business
is very competitive.

1134
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:01,307
Sounds like a lot of responsibility.
You must be good at it.

1135
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:03,409
I am...

1136
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:05,546
but it's no longer my real passion.

1137
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:09,649
So, what is Lauren's real passion?

1138
00:52:09,726 --> 00:52:11,853
I recently became involved
with the homeless.

1139
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:15,557
You know, fundraising,
building awareness.

1140
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:19,568
When I think of people going hungry,
it breaks my heart.

1141
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,001
Whew.

1142
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:24,598
I've done well for myself,
and I want to give something back.

1143
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:25,971
That reminds me.
I have some friends...

1144
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:28,033
who volunteer
at the mission downtown...

1145
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:29,772
and they hand out meals.

1146
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:30,904
They're out there helping out.

1147
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:34,917
How about you and I go down there
together so you can meet them?

1148
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,316
I'd love to.

1149
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,156
What's wrong?

1150
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:47,685
Ohh. I may have had
one drink too many. Mmm.

1151
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:49,698
Headache?

1152
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:50,926
A little.

1153
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,596
Ooh. You wouldn't be disappointed
if we made it an early night?

1154
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,901
No! I mean, it's just that...

1155
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:01,273
I'm having
such a wonderful time tonight.

1156
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,711
Get me some aspirin... extra strength.

1157
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,277
I really don't want you to go.

1158
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,511
You don't?

1159
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:12,714
I thought we were,
you know, connecting.

1160
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:14,313
Was I wrong?

1161
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,086
No, no, no, not at all.

1162
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,456
Mmm.

1163
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:24,199
Oh, yeah.

1164
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:28,130
Ah.

1165
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,400
Oh, that feels great.

1166
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:33,340
Mmm, mmm.

1167
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,708
Mmm.

1168
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:37,110
How's the headache?

1169
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:38,272
What headache?

1170
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:39,337
Ha ha.

1171
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:41,884
God, that feels good.

1172
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,419
I know.

1173
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:46,011
You are so tense.

1174
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:48,023
- Am I?
- Yeah.

1175
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:49,422
You're all knotted up.

1176
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:50,789
Mmm.

1177
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:52,851
You must have
a lot of stress in your life.

1178
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,556
Mm-hmm.

1179
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:55,996
Mmm.

1180
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:59,763
Oh, you poor baby.

1181
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:04,273
I want you to know that
I don't normally do this on a first date.

1182
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:07,003
Thank you.

1183
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,102
Now, what about your back?

1184
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:13,912
Mmm. Yeah, it's broke, it's broke.
It's... It's really broke.

1185
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,612
Do you mind if I take this off?

1186
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:22,886
No. I mean, if you must.

1187
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:25,519
I'll be right back.

1188
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,529
Why don't you take that shirt off?

1189
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,900
- Ah.
- For the massage.

1190
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:34,562
Right, right.

1191
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:38,636
Whew.

1192
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:44,476
OK, let's see what's goin' on.

1193
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:48,345
Ha ha ha!

1194
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:51,410
Uh-huh. Yeah.

1195
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:52,978
# Come on #

1196
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,684
# Hey there, sugar darlin' #

1197
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,852
# Let me tell you somethin' #

1198
00:54:57,927 --> 00:55:02,489
# Girl, I've been tryin' to say, now #

1199
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,624
# You look so sweet #

1200
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,135
# And you're so doggone fine #

1201
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:10,104
# I just can't get you out of my mind... #

1202
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:12,368
Oh! Ha ha ha!

1203
00:55:12,442 --> 00:55:13,500
Ohh.

1204
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,408
Whoo.

1205
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,504
Mmm.

1206
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:21,744
Ohh. You know what?
You really have the touch.

1207
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,615
Heh heh.

1208
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:25,314
I have an idea.

1209
00:55:25,388 --> 00:55:26,980
You want me to strip for you?

1210
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:28,752
Why don't I?

1211
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,417
That works for me.

1212
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,757
Heh heh heh.

1213
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:36,362
Ahh.

1214
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:39,197
Mm-mm-mmm.

1215
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,068
# Groove me, baby #

1216
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:46,540
OK. Ohh, yeah.

1217
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:49,077
# Oh, yeah, now, now, darlin' #

1218
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:52,546
# Uhh, come on, come on #

1219
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:54,048
# Hey! Uhh! #

1220
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:56,142
Mm-mm-mmm.

1221
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,378
Oww.

1222
00:55:58,455 --> 00:56:01,219
Ha ha ha!

1223
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:02,451
Mm.

1224
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,856
# Here's some good, good lovin' #

1225
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:09,695
Mm. All right, woman. Mm!

1226
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:10,960
Mm-mm-mmm.

1227
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,733
I want to make love to you.

1228
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:16,465
OK.

1229
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:19,508
# You don't need no company #

1230
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,544
- Ha!
- Ha!

1231
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:23,238
# No other man, no other girl #

1232
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:25,342
What's that?

1233
00:56:25,415 --> 00:56:28,248
I hope you don't mind.
I love taping it.

1234
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,149
Taping it?
Hold up. Hold... Hold... Hold...

1235
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,585
I've never done that before.

1236
00:56:31,654 --> 00:56:34,748
Oh. I really get off on it.

1237
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:39,687
Look, Lauren, I'm really shy, all right?

1238
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:43,358
I find it very arousing...

1239
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:45,196
like an aphrodisiac.

1240
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:49,261
To be honest,
I'd rather this be off-camera.

1241
00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:50,363
You understand?

1242
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,931
Please?

1243
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:56,703
Well...

1244
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,374
there's a first time for everything.

1245
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:02,043
I should be open
to new experiences, right?

1246
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:05,019
Yes! You won't regret it.

1247
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:06,885
- Well, turn the damn thing on.
- Whoo!

1248
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:09,356
- Ha ha ha!
- Ohh.

1249
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,450
Heh heh heh.

1250
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:15,126
- I must be dreamin'.
- Mm-hmm.

1251
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:17,132
Come on, baby.

1252
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,361
Ha ha ha! Whoo!

1253
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,403
# Come on, come on #

1254
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:21,459
Ohh!

1255
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:24,632
# Groove me, baby #

1256
00:57:24,707 --> 00:57:27,540
# Groove me, baby #

1257
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,110
I'll be right back.

1258
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,104
Lauren's eye in the sky.

1259
00:58:01,177 --> 00:58:02,576
Gotta have security.

1260
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,405
So, what's up?

1261
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:09,441
My VCR at home is broken,
so this is a world premiere.

1262
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,545
- So, how was it?
- Be patient.

1263
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:14,385
No, I meant did you...

1264
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:16,425
Let's just say if this was a movie...

1265
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:19,257
it would be in the adult section
of the video store.

1266
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,762
- Heh heh.
- Really?

1267
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,960
This is something
I like to call <i>Girl Gone Wild.</i>

1268
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,969
OK, ladies. Ready?

1269
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:29,095
Here it goes.

1270
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:32,533
Clear! You scream it!

1271
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:35,669
H-o-r-e!

1272
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:37,542
What the hell's this?

1273
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:39,343
Something's wrong.

1274
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:40,882
I'm confused.

1275
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:44,113
Um... which one is you? Hmm?

1276
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,382
What's up with this tape?

1277
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:50,620
I've got two words, honey... no carbs.

1278
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:52,820
Well, maybe you switched it
with a tape at home?

1279
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:55,956
I only have one tape, Emily.

1280
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,294
OK.

1281
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,392
Lauren, was there a reason...

1282
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:03,030
that you wanted us to watch
<i>The Jerry Springer Show?</i>

1283
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:07,167
The camera was fine. I don't...
I just don't understand this.

1284
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:09,211
The light was on, he was naked.

1285
00:59:09,279 --> 00:59:11,144
What was your favorite rule
again, huh?

1286
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:12,340
Visual proof?

1287
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,977
- This is not fair.
- Honey, you lost.

1288
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,384
- I did not lose!
- Yes, you did.

1289
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:20,388
We did it. Twice!

1290
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:21,855
- Twice?
- Twice?

1291
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:23,790
Well, just to make sure.

1292
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,851
Well, did you tape over it or something?

1293
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,760
No, no. I made sure that it was...

1294
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:30,765
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

1295
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:34,564
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

1296
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:36,002
OK, you know what?

1297
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,267
I think we should forget
about the contest.

1298
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:39,330
What?

1299
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,969
Now?
After what I've been through?

1300
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:43,376
What about what <i>I've</i> been through?

1301
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:46,381
- What about me?
- What about you?

1302
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,041
- You lost.
- You lost, too!

1303
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:49,141
- So?
- So?

1304
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:52,085
Ladies!
We're fighting... about what?

1305
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,795
Hmm. I just don't get it.

1306
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:10,128
No, on our show...
There's a "W" there.

1307
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:13,608
I'm sorry, Jerry.

1308
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:16,110
Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!

1309
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:38,500
I knew it was just a matter of time
before I met bachelorette number three.

1310
01:00:45,174 --> 01:00:47,768
And there she was.

1311
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,684
Do you mind if I have a seat?

1312
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,126
Oh, no. That's fine.

1313
01:01:12,902 --> 01:01:14,802
Do you know what time it is?

1314
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,069
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1315
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:22,111
# I made a wish #

1316
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,442
# On a shooting star... #

1317
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,311
- Ha ha.
- Heh.

1318
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:27,610
So, what are you reading?

1319
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:35,423
- Ha ha ha ha!
- Ha ha!

1320
01:01:35,491 --> 01:01:37,459
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

1321
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:41,361
- Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.
- My friends think I'm too nice.

1322
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:42,796
I'm sure you are.

1323
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,766
Heh. Well, I don't know.

1324
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:49,396
It's all so confusing. Who knows?

1325
01:01:49,472 --> 01:01:51,064
# Is it real #

1326
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:55,440
# Or am I living in a fantasy? #

1327
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:58,810
# I'll take my chances #

1328
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:02,009
# If it's possible that miracles #

1329
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:05,486
# Can happen if you're cynical #

1330
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:07,921
# Someday, yeah #

1331
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:11,721
# 'Cause something this good
never lasts #

1332
01:02:11,794 --> 01:02:14,126
# Lasts forever #

1333
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:20,227
# I want it to be the first time, baby #

1334
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:26,208
# I'm trying to find a way to make it #

1335
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:30,644
# Something much more than usual #

1336
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:34,843
# Much more than usual #

1337
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:45,726
# I search the sky #

1338
01:02:45,795 --> 01:02:49,060
# For a sign of light #

1339
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:55,037
# While Orion aimed his arrow
at oblivion #

1340
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:58,130
# And I wonder #

1341
01:02:58,207 --> 01:03:01,005
# As the northern lights are shining #

1342
01:03:01,077 --> 01:03:04,478
# If they're bright tonight
for guiding me #

1343
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:06,674
# Somewhere #

1344
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:09,343
# Stay by my side #

1345
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:12,910
# I need you here with me #

1346
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:15,822
# If they're sending out a message #

1347
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:19,020
# That we need to know #

1348
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:21,928
# Help me through it #

1349
01:03:21,998 --> 01:03:25,559
# If we find a way together... #

1350
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,160
Hello? It's Andrea.

1351
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:30,102
Hey, it's me. I got your message.

1352
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,164
I wanted to talk to you
about Emily and Mark.

1353
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:34,072
You know they're getting together
this weekend.

1354
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,270
I know. I booked them
a table at my place.

1355
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:39,007
I bet you did, Little Miss Nosey.

1356
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:43,177
Look, Emily's our girl,
and you know she's really feeling Mark.

1357
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:44,947
I don't want to see her get hurt.

1358
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:45,988
Nor do I.

1359
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:50,788
Good. So... I was
thinking about putting an end to it.

1360
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,293
How would you accomplish that?

1361
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:55,660
Well, the only right thing to do
is to call Mark and tip him off.

1362
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:56,823
What do you think?

1363
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:59,493
I think she's gonna beat you at
your own game, and you don't like it.

1364
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:02,163
That is not it at all, Lauren.

1365
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:05,139
And I think you may be a little jealous.

1366
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:08,371
Of Emily? Ha!
Don't be ridiculous. You trippin'.

1367
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:10,173
Maybe I'm wrong.

1368
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,713
Oh, you're definitely wrong.

1369
01:04:11,781 --> 01:04:15,877
You're just still pissed off...
about <i>Jerry Springer,</i> aren't you?

1370
01:04:15,952 --> 01:04:18,011
I don't understand how we both lost.

1371
01:04:18,087 --> 01:04:22,148
I was thinking the same thing.
That's why I should call Mark.

1372
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:24,489
Look, Andrea, don't do anything, OK?

1373
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,495
Lauren? You're breaking up.

1374
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:28,552
Andrea?

1375
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:30,258
Can you hear me now?
You're breaking up.

1376
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,233
Call you later!

1377
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:36,233
Unbelievable.

1378
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:40,940
Hey, baby. Miss me?

1379
01:04:44,447 --> 01:04:46,381
Well, hi there.

1380
01:04:57,093 --> 01:04:58,151
Ooh.

1381
01:05:00,029 --> 01:05:03,294
That's my jam. Yeah. Uhh! Uhh!

1382
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:05,357
Carlos, man.
He thinks he can check me, dawg.

1383
01:05:05,434 --> 01:05:06,924
He's over here talkin' smack to me.

1384
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:09,233
I'm gonna pull out
my bag of tricks for you.

1385
01:05:09,305 --> 01:05:10,567
Gonna give you
some of this Michael Jordan.

1386
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:12,267
You want some of this Jordan?

1387
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:15,902
Ah! Man, don't reach.
You want some of that? Ha ha ha!

1388
01:05:15,978 --> 01:05:19,175
Huh? Y'all wanna see the show?
Come on, y'all wanna see the show?

1389
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:22,012
Wanna see some of that Kobe Bryant?
Wanna see a little Kobe?

1390
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,348
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

1391
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:29,546
You don't do that to Kobe, OK?
You let Kobe go.

1392
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:31,286
<i>And</i> that was a foul.

1393
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:32,622
Check it up.

1394
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:36,626
Hey.

1395
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,190
Ha ha! Hey, Holmes.
Tonight's the night.

1396
01:05:39,268 --> 01:05:40,394
Mm-hmm.

1397
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:43,438
You don't sound too excited.
It's a sure thing, right?

1398
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:45,531
It's not that. It's just that I wish...

1399
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,633
I wish I could've done this
differently, that's all.

1400
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,610
Man, if you ask me,
you played it perfectly.

1401
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:55,276
Did I? I'm... sorry I had to meet her
this way, man.

1402
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:57,080
They didn't know
who they was dealin' with.

1403
01:05:57,153 --> 01:06:00,350
They tried to play you, remember?
You're the winner.

1404
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:01,390
Yeah.

1405
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,186
So, tell her the truth.

1406
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,227
And I usually don't recommend that.

1407
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,761
But in this case, hey...

1408
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:09,423
I'm in too deep, J.
What am I supposed to say?

1409
01:06:09,498 --> 01:06:11,864
"Hey, Emily, I overheard your bet.

1410
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:15,995
Had sex with your two friends,
but I like you more."

1411
01:06:16,072 --> 01:06:17,937
Yeah, that don't sound too good.

1412
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:20,407
So, what you gonna do, blow it off?

1413
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:22,103
I mean, this is what you wanted.

1414
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:26,774
Yeah, I thought so, too,
but now I don't know, man.

1415
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:28,783
Look, look,
don't beat yourself up about it.

1416
01:06:28,851 --> 01:06:33,015
Now, you have dinner,
do your business, and that's it.

1417
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,922
Great advice, Josh. Really, thanks.

1418
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,654
No problem.
Just let me know what happens.

1419
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,808
Yeah.

1420
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,711
Two naughty little girls.

1421
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:05,281
Chocolate. Chocolate.

1422
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,288
Damn!

1423
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:08,448
Hello?

1424
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:09,786
Hey, man. What's up?

1425
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:13,090
Aw, nothin'. Just sitting here
watching Discovery Channel, that's all.

1426
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:15,858
The Discovery Channel? What's on?

1427
01:07:15,931 --> 01:07:18,559
You know, nature.
Documentaries and stuff, man.

1428
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:19,726
Yeah.

1429
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:21,827
And actually, it's quite fascinating.

1430
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:23,132
Uh-huh.

1431
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:27,740
Hold on, man. I'll be back.
Somebody's at the door.

1432
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,648
I'm sorry to bother you.

1433
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,879
No bother at all.
What can I do for you?

1434
01:07:36,952 --> 01:07:39,750
I cannot get the door open.
The lock must be broken.

1435
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:41,915
Lock be broke, lock be fixed.

1436
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:45,358
- I'll be back.
- OK.

1437
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:48,327
I gotta go. I'll call you later.

1438
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:49,591
What's goin' on?

1439
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:52,293
It's an emergency.
Life and death! I gotta go!

1440
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:58,472
Uh, let me try that. Yeah.

1441
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,475
If you can, I would be so grateful.

1442
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:01,703
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1443
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:06,476
Well, see, this is a matter
of, uh, delicacy and finesse.

1444
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:07,573
Mm-hmm.

1445
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:10,050
You know? It's all in the wiggle.

1446
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:13,088
- You just can't shove it in.
- Right.

1447
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:17,023
Oh, and mustn't be too rough.

1448
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:19,618
And before you know it...

1449
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:21,390
she's open.

1450
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:23,295
Yes! Oh!

1451
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:25,299
So sweet. Come on in.

1452
01:08:25,367 --> 01:08:27,528
Ah! Thank you.

1453
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,941
- My hero.
- Heh.

1454
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:39,275
It was nothin'.

1455
01:08:39,348 --> 01:08:40,440
To you.

1456
01:08:40,516 --> 01:08:42,313
- Josh.
- Sharise.

1457
01:08:42,384 --> 01:08:43,351
Mmm.

1458
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:44,647
You know, I can't thank you enough.

1459
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,086
I don't know what I would've done
if you hadn't come along.

1460
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:48,919
You know what?
I'm just glad I could help.

1461
01:08:48,991 --> 01:08:49,980
Mm-hmm.

1462
01:08:50,059 --> 01:08:51,686
This is delicious.

1463
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,125
Heh heh.

1464
01:08:56,632 --> 01:08:58,497
Oh, no!

1465
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,057
That's the last of it.

1466
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:02,263
You mind going to the store?

1467
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:05,068
You want me to go to the store?

1468
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:08,633
I love this wine. Heh.

1469
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:10,110
I'm going to the store.

1470
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:11,578
It's right down the street.

1471
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:12,978
OK.

1472
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,314
And, Josh...

1473
01:09:16,385 --> 01:09:17,977
while you're there...

1474
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:20,180
pick up a box of condoms.

1475
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:27,489
Hey, move it!

1476
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:37,896
- That was quick.
- Yeah.

1477
01:09:37,973 --> 01:09:39,804
I didn't want to keep you waiting.

1478
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:42,207
I got the wine and...

1479
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:49,114
You are simply impeccable.

1480
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,050
Impeccable. Impeccable.

1481
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:55,250
Why? Because you got it goin' on.
You got it goin' on.

1482
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:56,985
Who's the man? You're the man.

1483
01:09:57,059 --> 01:09:58,526
Who's the man? You're the man.

1484
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:00,687
'Cause you got it goin' on. Ah!

1485
01:10:00,763 --> 01:10:02,993
Ah! Uhh! Uhh!

1486
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:04,532
# Got it goin' on #

1487
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:06,261
# I got it goin' on #

1488
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:08,030
# I got it goin' on #

1489
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:11,766
# I got it, I got it, I got it, uhh, ahh #

1490
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,173
# Got it goin' on, I got it goin' on,
I got it, ooh! #

1491
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:17,474
Get your ass in here!

1492
01:10:19,148 --> 01:10:20,513
Well, all right.

1493
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:45,466
Ahem.

1494
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,579
- Hey.
- Hey.

1495
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:53,774
Wow.

1496
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:54,907
Wow.

1497
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:56,144
Look what I got for you.

1498
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:57,651
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

1499
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,711
Ohh, so sweet.

1500
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:07,695
All right. OK?

1501
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:11,191
I'm glad you could make it.

1502
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:17,735
Have to admit...

1503
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:20,138
I never thought she'd get this far.

1504
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:22,905
Aren't you glad
I got the closed circuit hook-up?

1505
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:27,312
It's not a very good picture,
and I can't hear a thing.

1506
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:30,045
By the way, did you reach Mark?

1507
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:33,054
He wouldn't return my phone call.

1508
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,920
I wonder why.

1509
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:37,481
Ahh.

1510
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:40,456
Ahem.

1511
01:11:40,529 --> 01:11:41,860
This is really nice.

1512
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:43,625
Yeah, a friend of mine owns it.

1513
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:44,893
Heh.

1514
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:51,801
That's it, Emily. Smile!

1515
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:53,432
Just flirt a little it. Be yourself.

1516
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:54,533
Oh!

1517
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:08,313
Huh.

1518
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:15,024
- Looking for someone?
- Oh, God!

1519
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:18,066
Emily, you scared me.

1520
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:21,466
What a coincidence. I was just here
meeting my, uh, gynecologist for a...

1521
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:22,731
Uh-huh. We need to talk.

1522
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:23,897
- Huh?
- Now.

1523
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:26,031
Oh, all right. Hold on. My drink.

1524
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:27,666
I'm coming. Ow. Ow.

1525
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:29,677
- What?
- You're spying on me?

1526
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:33,476
Oh, Emily. "Spying"
is an ugly, ugly word, all right?

1527
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:36,313
I am here... I am supporting you.
I am cheering you on.

1528
01:12:36,385 --> 01:12:39,081
This goes a bit beyond supportive,
don't you think?

1529
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:41,418
No.
Emily, you have to understand me.

1530
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:44,323
This is an important part
of your treatment, OK?

1531
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:46,190
Tonight could be
a breakthrough for you.

1532
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:47,660
A breakthrough?
Are you kidding me?

1533
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:48,754
No.

1534
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:51,322
Dr. Klemmer,
I want you to leave immediately.

1535
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,392
No. No, I can't. I... I... I just ordered
some potato skins.

1536
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:56,199
Besides, I'm gonna sit
over there in the corner.

1537
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:57,670
I'm gonna be very tiny...
shh... like a quiet mouse.

1538
01:12:57,740 --> 01:12:58,866
You won't even know I'm there.

1539
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:01,000
This whole situation is a great big mess.

1540
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:04,375
I want you to leave now. Now.

1541
01:13:04,446 --> 01:13:06,175
All right. Emily...

1542
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:07,340
- Now.
- OK.

1543
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:08,610
- I'm leaving, all right?
- Shh!

1544
01:13:08,684 --> 01:13:10,777
I'm gonna cancel the skins.
I'm 100% behind you.

1545
01:13:10,853 --> 01:13:12,844
Look at me. Here I go.

1546
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:16,823
Like hell I'd miss this.

1547
01:13:19,728 --> 01:13:20,820
Everything OK?

1548
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:22,488
Oh, just perfect.

1549
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:29,195
Hurry up, she's back.

1550
01:13:29,271 --> 01:13:30,636
What happened?

1551
01:13:30,706 --> 01:13:32,731
I don't know. She just, like, took off.

1552
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:34,605
How's your food?

1553
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:36,075
Oh, it's fine.

1554
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:39,842
I mean, I'm sure it is. It always is.
How's yours?

1555
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,405
- Couldn't be better.
- Good.

1556
01:13:41,483 --> 01:13:42,677
- Mark...
- Emily...

1557
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,446
Oh, I'm sorry. You go first.

1558
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,715
- No. You, please.
- No, I can wait.

1559
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:48,279
I insist. Ladies first.

1560
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,858
Heh.

1561
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:53,955
Something's wrong, isn't it?

1562
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:56,361
Mark, I need to tell you something.

1563
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,592
You can tell me anything.

1564
01:13:57,666 --> 01:13:59,190
I don't want to, but I have to.

1565
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:02,431
- Look, Emily...
- No, this has gone on long enough.

1566
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,938
What are you...
Come on, don't blow it, Emily.

1567
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:07,498
What are you talking about?
What...

1568
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:10,010
What are you looking at?
This is my patient.

1569
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:12,103
I'm working now. Thank you.

1570
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:15,576
The thing is,
I like you very much, Mark.

1571
01:14:15,651 --> 01:14:17,380
I feel the same way about you.

1572
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:21,856
Well, you may not after you hear
what I have to tell you.

1573
01:14:23,692 --> 01:14:25,990
Oh, my God. This isn't easy for me.

1574
01:14:26,061 --> 01:14:27,790
OK, I'm just gonna say it.

1575
01:14:27,863 --> 01:14:29,592
What is she saying? What's going on?

1576
01:14:29,665 --> 01:14:32,566
I don't know! I told you
we should've bugged the table.

1577
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:33,760
Damn.

1578
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:37,465
So, my plan was to bring you
home with me tonight...

1579
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:40,508
and... well, you know.

1580
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:42,168
I think so.

1581
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:45,907
But now that I'm here with you...
I can't.

1582
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:48,449
I just can't go through with it.

1583
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:50,314
Oh, Emily.

1584
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:51,409
Ohh.

1585
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,954
She's telling him everything!

1586
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:55,319
I knew she didn't have it in her.

1587
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:59,190
No, it was wrong.
It was devious, dishonest...

1588
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:01,388
Let me ask you something.

1589
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:04,023
You said that you were gonna bail out.

1590
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:05,532
Why didn't you?

1591
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,364
I should have.

1592
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:09,267
God, I wish I had.

1593
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:13,568
But the truth is...

1594
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:17,043
I wanted to meet you.

1595
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:20,608
That day
you walked in the restaurant...

1596
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:23,446
the first time I saw you...

1597
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,214
I thought...

1598
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:28,484
"Wow. He looks so nice...

1599
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:31,048
confident, together."

1600
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,491
You know, it's silly...

1601
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:35,223
but sometimes you just get
a feeling about someone...

1602
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:36,787
even from across the room.

1603
01:15:38,333 --> 01:15:41,200
Listen, if you never want
to speak to me again...

1604
01:15:41,270 --> 01:15:42,567
I completely understand.

1605
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:45,368
Emily, I need to tell you something...

1606
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,237
and I hope that...

1607
01:15:48,844 --> 01:15:52,575
when I tell you this, you'll find it
in your heart to forgive me.

1608
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:55,640
Forgive <i>you?</i> For what?

1609
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:58,811
When you were at the restaurant
with your girlfriends...

1610
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,588
I felt really bad about it...

1611
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:12,065
not telling you the whole thing.

1612
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:13,601
Emily.

1613
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:15,534
Ohh. Emily!

1614
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:17,932
You don't have enough cameras.

1615
01:16:18,006 --> 01:16:21,169
And there's no damn sound.

1616
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:23,541
Emily, Emily. Wait, wait, wait.

1617
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:25,944
Emily, Emily, Emily.
Listen, listen, please.

1618
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,675
Just please. Sit here.
Come on, baby. Sit here.

1619
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:28,716
What the...

1620
01:16:28,784 --> 01:16:30,945
Excuse me. Emily...

1621
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:33,886
I didn't plan any of this.
It just happened.

1622
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:35,446
You know him?

1623
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:38,084
I mean, I heard your voices,
I looked over.

1624
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:39,650
I saw three beautiful ladies...

1625
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:41,491
talking about how
they each were gonna have sex...

1626
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:43,656
with the next guy
that walks in the door.

1627
01:16:43,732 --> 01:16:46,792
- Three of 'em?
- Honestly, I got caught up, OK?

1628
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:49,530
What was I to do?
Emily, a guy like me...

1629
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,836
I'd be lucky to meet one of you
in a lifetime, much less three.

1630
01:16:52,908 --> 01:16:55,308
- Oh, they're freaks!
- I think any man in my position...

1631
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:57,607
would've at least considered
the same thing.

1632
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,910
Look, my man,
if three beautiful women...

1633
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:02,974
wanted to make love to you,
would that be a problem?

1634
01:17:03,051 --> 01:17:05,076
For me? No. But for my wife?

1635
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:07,417
She don't get down like that
no more, player.

1636
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:10,287
Don't tell 'em my...
Um... heh. Wait a minute.

1637
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:13,089
Maybe we should let them
have this table.

1638
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:15,925
No. I'm sorry. I apologize.
We're ruining your dinner.

1639
01:17:15,998 --> 01:17:18,967
No, not really, man.
This is off the chain. I love this.

1640
01:17:19,034 --> 01:17:20,968
Wait, wait, George, George,
don't you get it?

1641
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:24,130
This is one of those, uh,
hidden camera TV shows.

1642
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:25,332
- You bullshittin'!
- No!

1643
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:26,499
Where the camera at?

1644
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:27,837
I don't know.
They hide 'em somewhere.

1645
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:29,274
Oh! Off the chain.

1646
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:30,504
- Emily...
- Oh.

1647
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:31,944
I wore my nice dress.

1648
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:34,676
You said it yourself.
You're as guilty as I am.

1649
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,411
And the way I see it...

1650
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,977
if it wasn't for your contest,
we wouldn't have met.

1651
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:45,583
Emily, please.
I don't want to lose you.

1652
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:48,357
Ohh. Go ahead. Forgive him, girl.

1653
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:50,660
He seems like a nice guy.

1654
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:53,326
And y'all look great together.
I mean, perfect. Better than perfect.

1655
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:54,630
- Y'all do.
- Heh.

1656
01:17:54,703 --> 01:17:56,933
Emily...

1657
01:17:57,005 --> 01:18:00,270
I have never said this
to anyone in my life.

1658
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:03,209
When I look at you,
I see everything I've ever wanted.

1659
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:05,576
Hey, I don't have all the answers.

1660
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:08,138
But the one thing
that I am so sure of...

1661
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:10,776
is that I want a chance
to have you in my life.

1662
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:14,618
Oh. That is so sweet.

1663
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,658
Why you never say anything like that?

1664
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:18,522
This is TV, girl. This ain't real.

1665
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:21,027
- Get your mind right.
- Shut up.

1666
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:23,621
Emily, unless I'm wrong...

1667
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,827
you do have feelings for me,
don't you?

1668
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:32,567
Good. That is good.

1669
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:37,078
So, uh, how about, uh, we start over?

1670
01:18:37,145 --> 01:18:39,807
You know? No more games.

1671
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:41,212
Total honesty from here on.

1672
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:43,274
Go, girl. Give him another shot.

1673
01:18:43,351 --> 01:18:45,410
Emily, you could do that.
It's worth it.

1674
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:46,545
Heh.

1675
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:47,918
Go ahead.

1676
01:18:49,424 --> 01:18:51,221
Why don't we go for a walk?

1677
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:53,659
Yeah. Come on.

1678
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,755
- Wait, wait, wait. Where y'all goin'?
- Hey, hey, where you goin'?

1679
01:18:56,832 --> 01:19:00,324
The show just started.
We got thirty minutes, don't we?

1680
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,666
All right, now.
Y'all was good, though.

1681
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,228
That was good.
That was a good performance.

1682
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:05,568
Y'all were da bomb!

1683
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,733
Oh, man, that's a Golden Globe.

1684
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:11,006
Golden Globe for sure!
I almost dropped a tear!

1685
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:12,239
- Shoot.
- Ha ha!

1686
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:14,509
I think I saw him on
<i>The Young and the Restless.</i>

1687
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,244
You think we're going to get a check
for being on the show?

1688
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:17,478
I don't know about a check...

1689
01:19:17,552 --> 01:19:19,452
but you better keep your eyes
in your head next time.

1690
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:20,681
I saw you lookin' at her.

1691
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:23,224
- What you talkin' about...
- I saw you lookin' at her!

1692
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:25,054
Heh. You gotta keep
bringin' it up, OK?

1693
01:19:25,127 --> 01:19:26,754
Speakin' of checks... check, please!

1694
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:27,852
Give him the check.

1695
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:30,227
Nah, you know I ain't got it.
We'll go to jail together.

1696
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:32,095
I ain't goin' to jail.
You already been five times.

1697
01:19:32,167 --> 01:19:34,431
That's all right. At least I'll be full,
and I know people.

1698
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:35,595
Oh, you full, all right.

1699
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:36,728
That's all right.
They're gonna get you.

1700
01:19:36,805 --> 01:19:39,273
- Full of shit!
- I gotta get up out of here.

1701
01:19:39,341 --> 01:19:41,400
Let me go buy you a drink.

1702
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:42,966
Heh. Make it a double.

1703
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:45,274
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

1704
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,545
Can I get you another drink?

1705
01:19:53,822 --> 01:19:57,155
- Heh. Hello.
- Hi.

1706
01:19:57,225 --> 01:19:58,556
You want to buy me a drink?

1707
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:01,391
Yeah. Unless I'm intruding.

1708
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:03,124
Oh, intrude away.

1709
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:05,325
Heh. Bartender, another, um...

1710
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,833
Oh, a kir royale.

1711
01:20:06,902 --> 01:20:09,769
Kir royale for the lovely lady...

1712
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:11,601
and one for me as well.

1713
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:17,009
# Something this good
never lasts forever #

1714
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:22,573
# I want it to be the first time, baby #

1715
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:28,783
# I'm trying to find a way to make it #

1716
01:20:28,857 --> 01:20:33,817
# Something much more than usual #

1717
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:38,992
# And something this good
never lasts forever... #

1718
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:43,026
So, Lauren and I got played,
and Emily ends up with Mark.

1719
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:44,833
That's OK.

1720
01:20:44,906 --> 01:20:47,431
Like I said, she <i>is</i> my girl...

1721
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,568
and I taught her everything she knows.

1722
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:54,104
And you have to admit,
they do look kind of good together.

1723
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,116
But enough about them.

1724
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:59,085
Now... back to me.

1725
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:02,314
Knew I should've left that club early.

1726
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:04,790
That's the restaurant
we should've been goin' to.

1727
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:05,952
- OK.
- We'd have three of 'em.

1728
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:08,052
Three of 'em come in... together!

1729
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:11,292
I'm outta here.
You done held me back long enough.

1730
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:13,231
- Heh heh.
- I got dreams.

1731
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:14,632
Mm-hmm. I know you got dreams.

1732
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:15,965
That man got three of 'em.

1733
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:17,299
- Ha ha!
- Three of 'em.

1734
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:18,703
Ha ha ha ha!

1735
01:21:18,773 --> 01:21:20,673
# Fallin' for you #

1736
01:21:20,742 --> 01:21:25,839
# For the things that you do
make me feel... #

1737
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:27,438
Uhh!

1738
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:29,745
That was great... somewhat.
But OK.

1739
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:31,115
Ha ha ha!

1740
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:33,120
Two more. You all right.

1741
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:34,712
- I'm gettin' tired.
- All right.

1742
01:21:34,789 --> 01:21:36,222
- Yeah.
- Cut.

1743
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:39,260
That girl was crazy, if you ask me.
She made a big mistake.

1744
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:40,726
You damn right.

1745
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:47,096
Tanya, where you at, girl?

1746
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:48,931
I thought you was goin' to the bathroom.

1747
01:21:49,004 --> 01:21:51,268
You left me here.
I don't have no money.

1748
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:53,273
But you done left me for the last time.

1749
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:55,104
What up, what up, what up, what up?

1750
01:21:55,176 --> 01:21:57,542
Oh, my boy. Baby, what is up?

1751
01:21:57,612 --> 01:21:59,443
You ain't gonna believe
what went down...

1752
01:21:59,514 --> 01:22:02,950
this here evenin'
in this restaurant. Oh!

1753
01:22:03,018 --> 01:22:06,545
Man, I done messed around
and fell up in a reality show.

1754
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:07,781
I mean, lord, have mercy.

1755
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:11,019
This woman,
finer than a government job!

1756
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:15,085
Level from one to ten...
she's a fuckin' fifteen!

1757
01:22:15,163 --> 01:22:16,528
Fifteen!

1758
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:18,395
You should've seen them.
All of 'em was fine.

1759
01:22:18,466 --> 01:22:20,764
Baskin-Robbins...
he had all kinda flavors.

1760
01:22:20,835 --> 01:22:22,803
One was French vanilla,
one was vanilla...

1761
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:24,862
and one was choc-a-lot!

1762
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,464
Yeah, and they videotaped it, though...

1763
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:28,406
so you're gonna have
to make love with your shirt on...

1764
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:31,001
'cause, you know,
you got male breasts and stuff.

1765
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:33,104
That kind of thing
might break you out, you know?

1766
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:35,012
Yeah! Fine women.

1767
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:36,710
I'm talkin' 'bout
got they own money...

1768
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:39,276
face done, nails...
ain't like the women we mess with...

1769
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:41,219
you know, got three fingers
and stuff like that.

1770
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:43,189
It's hard makin' love
to a woman with three fingers.

1771
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:46,159
They rub on your back,
you start squirmin' and stuff.

1772
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:48,058
Oh, lord! Yeah!

1773
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:50,791
You got to get down here.
Man, I'm not lyin'.

1774
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:52,594
Better than the midgets you ever had.

1775
01:22:52,667 --> 01:22:54,396
Leave the toys at home, man.

1776
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:56,334
You're goin' to hell in a limo.

1777
01:22:56,404 --> 01:22:57,894
You need to get your mind right.

1778
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,168
Do you know I am the man?

1779
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:01,674
Hey, baby. I'm glad I caught you.

1780
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:04,610
Before you say anything,
look, I mean it this time...

1781
01:23:04,679 --> 01:23:06,340
I know I ain't made love
past the commercial...

1782
01:23:06,414 --> 01:23:08,575
but you talkin' to a new man now, baby.

1783
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:11,016
And I'm gonna give it to you
like you never had it before.

1784
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:13,486
Forget viagra. I had diagna.

1785
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:15,352
That mean I've been denied.

1786
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:19,359
I'm telling you, I'm having an epiphany
about me and you right now.

1787
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:21,520
Well, who is this?

1788
01:23:21,596 --> 01:23:23,928
I don't know no Laquisha.

1789
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:26,900
Well, I'd like to know you.
I mean, the offer stands for you, too.

1790
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:28,629
I mean, if you come pick me up.

1791
01:23:28,703 --> 01:23:30,398
Cut. Ha ha! I'm sorry.
