00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,794
<i></i>
<i>You don't know me...</i>

2
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,765
<i>unless you know</i>
<i>about me and Tom Sawyer,</i>

3
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,136
<i>where we've been,</i>

4
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:12,805
<i>what we've done together.</i>

5
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,114
Huckleberry!

6
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,787
You'll respect
your father, boy.

7
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,657
Meow!
Where do you
think you're going?

8
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:37,196
Huck, get your ass
back in here!
Meow!

9
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:41,133
<i></i>
<i>Tom was the closest thing</i>
<i>to real family I had.</i>

10
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:43,435
<i>He saw a world where we were</i>
<i>just one adventure away</i>

11
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,737
<i>from all our problems</i>
<i>disappearing forever.</i>

12
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:49,308
When we get the treasure,
you won't have to live
with your dad anymore.

13
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,111
You can live
wherever you want.
All right?

14
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:53,812
I care about you.

15
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,250
<i></i>
<i>Seemed that every second</i>

16
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:00,285
<i>he was dreaming up</i>
<i>some new plan for us.</i>

17
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:05,357
<i>But the grandaddy of them all</i>
<i>was finding Murrel's treasure.</i>

18
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:07,359
<i>I probably don't</i>
<i>have to tell you</i>

19
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,895
<i>that John Andrews Murrel</i>
<i>was a notorious bandit.</i>

20
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:11,730
<i>Legend had it</i>
<i>that before Murrel died,</i>

21
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:14,133
<i>he hid his fortune</i>
<i>somewhere in town,</i>

22
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,468
<i>leaving clues</i>
<i>to its location.</i>

23
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,771
<i>But to this day,</i>
<i>no one's found it.</i>

24
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,842
<i>Tom figured he was</i>
<i>a lot like Murrel,</i>

25
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:26,912
<i>so it was only natural</i>
<i>that he'd be the one</i>
<i>to find the treasure.</i>

26
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,780
<i>Takes a pirate to think</i>
<i>like another pirate.</i>

27
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,885
<i>To Tom, trespassing</i>
<i>and other laws</i>

28
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:35,320
<i>didn't apply</i>
<i>to treasure hunters.</i>

29
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,223
<i>Ours was a special code.</i>

30
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:43,162
<i>The truth is, we weren't</i>
<i>the only ones looking.</i>

31
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,439
<i></i>
<i>Didn't really matter to me</i>

32
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,676
<i>that our adventures</i>
<i>never came out right.</i>
Hey! Stop!

33
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,412
Tom!

34
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,915
Huck!
Tom!

35
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:06,185
<i>With Tom, there was always</i>
<i>something great just ahead,</i>

36
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,187
<i>a dream to hold on to,</i>

37
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,190
<i>even if it seemed</i>
<i>there was only more bad coming.</i>

38
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,258
No, I'll take him
upstairs.

39
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,727
<i>It was a dream</i>
<i>worth pursuing,</i>

40
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:18,697
<i>time after time.</i>

41
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:28,607
<i>I suppose to a stranger's eyes,</i>
<i>Tom and I may seem</i>
<i>worlds apart now.</i>

42
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,509
<i>We may be</i>
<i>in different places,</i>

43
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,711
<i>but things</i>
<i>aren't that different.</i>

44
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:36,315
Where do you see yourself
in the next five years,
Mr., uh, Finn?

45
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,651
Well, sir, I, uh--

46
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:43,455
I guess I see myself
getting a good job.

47
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:46,525
How would you describe
your work on the police force
in one word?

48
00:03:46,527 --> 00:03:49,828
Great.
In the heat of battle.
The local hero.

49
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,630
The loc--
Great in battle.
Battle-tested.

50
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,932
One word, Tom.
Hero.

51
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,767
Hero.
Policeman.

52
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,803
You would describe your work
as "policeman."

53
00:03:57,805 --> 00:04:00,672
Um, I don't know.

54
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:02,307
Um...

55
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:05,811
Maybe a family?

56
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,983
Never had that.

57
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:13,819
Hard to have a family
when you're imprisoned.

58
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:16,855
That's why I'm never
coming back here again.

59
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,624
Make me a detective.
No.

60
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:20,492
Sid's a detective,
and he's an idiot.

61
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,561
Nice way to talk
about your brother.
Half-brother.

62
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,663
Lieutenant. Uh, sorry.
Shepherdson flipped.

63
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,032
Nice work, Sid.
Thank you.

64
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:29,968
If you'll excuse us, Tom.
Write tickets. Do your job.

65
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:35,807
<i></i>
<i>After so many years</i>
<i>of chasing the fairy tale,</i>

66
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,277
<i>most people would be ready</i>
<i>to give up.</i>

67
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,347
<i>But Tom Sawyer</i>
<i>isn't most people.</i>

68
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,858
Hey, Tom.
Huckleberry Finn.

69
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,561
Left the lights on
for ya.

70
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,463
Brings back memories.

71
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,733
Ah, shit. You know,
it's supposed to look
like fireworks, you know.

72
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,535
Like... Huck's back.

73
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:05,037
You're a cop.

74
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,039
Oh, yeah.

75
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:10,509
Figured if, uh, Sid
got to have a gun,
I should too.

76
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:13,378
So-Hey, thanks
for not saying anything
about me in there, man.

77
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,080
Appreciate that.

78
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,748
I got you something.

79
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,553
Huh?

80
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:25,490
Figured you probably
didn't get too much
of this stuff inside.

81
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:29,328
I ate some of the pie,
but there's till
over half left, so...

82
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,330
You staying
with the widow?

83
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:33,332
Yeah. For now.
Yeah. Cool, man.

84
00:05:33,334 --> 00:05:36,535
Things are gonna
be different this time.
I guarantee it.

85
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:39,638
I'll get more into that
later at your big party--
We got a party planned for you.

86
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,540
Okay.
Yeah, man.
You and me.

87
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:44,443
Huckleberry Finn
and Tom Sawyer, buddy.
Just you wait.

88
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:46,712
Come on.

89
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,714
Look at this guy.
It's good to see you.

90
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,849
You too, man.
Let's get outta here.

91
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,385
Put that shit
behind you. Right?

92
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,854
Oh, you gotta ride
in the back.
Sorry. It's protocol.

93
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,590
Right.
Watch your head.

94
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,826
You're under arrest.

95
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:07,499
<i></i>
<i>Just doesn't seem to matter,</i>

96
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:10,369
<i>knowing there's a time</i>
<i>you gotta let go,</i>

97
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,837
<i>gotta grow up.</i>

98
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,741
<i>Some things never change.</i>

99
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:19,478
<i>Even when</i>
<i>they probably should.</i>

100
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:37,062
I'm not ashamed of you.

101
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,068
Dear God,
please help
this shameful,

102
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,703
poor, lost lamb

103
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,471
to find his way.

104
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:49,574
Set him on your path.
Forgive him his mistakes.

105
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,009
Amen.

106
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:55,714
I feel like that worked.
Thank you.

107
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:59,117
Well, you can sleep here
as long as you stay
on the straight path.

108
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,787
If you gonna get a job,
you're gonna have to
look civilized.

109
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,956
Okay.

110
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:55,507
There you are.
How was the job search?

111
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,142
Pretty good.

112
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:59,845
Jorge, I need you
to come back tomorrow

113
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:02,547
and trim the branches
on the maple out back.

114
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:12,023
I'm saying that the walkway
out back is being blocked
and it can't just stay that way.

115
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:24,002
How do they not
know English?

116
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,918
Meow! Meow. Meow!

117
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,855
Meow.
Meow!

118
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,797
Hope you're ready
to party, buddy.

119
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,134
Oh, you know what?
I forgot. This is a--
This is a surprise party.

120
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,969
So...

121
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,738
Okay.
Yeah.

122
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,206
Act surprised, okay?

123
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,742
It'd just make the guys
feel great.
I got it.

124
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:06,645
Okay. Great.

125
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,914
Shit.
It does that.

126
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,692
Oh, hey, Amy.

127
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,861
Hi.
Nice... shirt.

128
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,063
So, Barnes downstairs?
Alone?

129
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,834
Cool.
We'll go look.

130
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,036
Excuse us.

131
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:38,043
Oh, no.

132
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,745
God, it's so dark.
I bet there's nobody
down here at all.

133
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,247
Surprise!

134
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,816
Just kidding.
We got him.

135
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,818
We got him.
We got him.

136
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,188
Turn on the AC.
The AC doesn't work down here.
Can I talk to you?

137
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,657
Are you doing
laundry right now?
You're out of underwear.

138
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,893
How's prison?
Bad, right?

139
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:58,163
Open up a window.
There's no window, Tom.
It's a basement. A man cave.

140
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:01,199
Sounds pretty weird.
Whatever. Let's do this.

141
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,735
Okay, we're gonna get
this Huckleberry Finn
welcome-back party

142
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,738
up on its feet
in three, two, one...

143
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:21,119
Then they broke up.
Yeah.

144
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:25,790
Oh, Huck, I almost forgot.

145
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,093
I got you a little
welcome-back present.

146
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,328
Oh.
Still selling these things
online.

147
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,198
And, uh, business
is going really well.

148
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,368
This is my newest model,
and I thought you might like it.

149
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,371
"My other car is Jesus."

150
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:42,374
"My other<i> car</i> is Jesus."

151
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:45,777
You should make
another one that says
"My other car is fishing."

152
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,979
Fishing is super-popular.

153
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,249
We weren't
supposed to bring gifts--
And I got him pie earlier, so...

154
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,852
We're all glad
to have Huck back, right?
That's why we're here.

155
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:55,854
To believe in that,
to celebrate that.

156
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:58,356
This is a party, okay?
Welcome back, Huck, right?

157
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,426
This is
for you, man.
Whoo! Huck!

158
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:05,163
And it's a meeting.
So let's start the meeting.

159
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:11,069
I know what you guys
are thinking.

160
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:15,440
Huck's been in jail. I don't
wanna have anything to do
with that stuff. Neither do I.

161
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:19,010
But I don't think
Huck's done anything wrong.
And that's coming from a cop.

162
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,947
You know what other cops do?
They write tickets
to your own grandmothers.

163
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,950
They let real criminals
get away with
whatever they want.

164
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,086
They make the wrong people
into detectives.

165
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,756
You know-The point is,
they have no perspective.

166
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,192
They have
no imagination.

167
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:37,095
And that's what
brings us to now.

168
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,698
An opportunity
has presented itself

169
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,332
to make real criminals pay

170
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:44,769
while we, the good guys,

171
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,238
get a little payday--
a<i> big</i> payday for ourselves.

172
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:51,276
So, if you're with me,

173
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:55,080
the way I see it,

174
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,981
this marks
the first meeting of...

175
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,090
the Band of Robbers.

176
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,492
Okay, robbers, Tom?

177
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,294
Think of it like this.

178
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:12,363
Robin Hood
and his merry men.

179
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:15,366
Robbing from the rich,
giving to the poor,
keeping some money.

180
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:18,269
Keeping the money. You know?
I wrote up an oath--

181
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,972
We're bad guys?
No, we're heroes.

182
00:12:20,974 --> 00:12:22,273
Sounds like bad guys.

183
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,008
When you steal
from criminals,

184
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,277
it makes stealing
more of a good thing
than a bad one.

185
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,880
Hang on and I'll--
It's still illegal though.
Right?

186
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:32,083
Ben, do you wanna be working
for Barnes your whole life
at the auto shop?

187
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,186
Having to borrow money
from your half-brother?
I don't have a half-brother.

188
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:37,355
It's an expression.
Look.

189
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:41,126
My ex-fiancée used to say,
"He's never gonna do
anything special.

190
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,128
He's always
gonna be like a kid."

191
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,030
Man, we all know
you're talking about
Amy right now.

192
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:49,300
She's my wife.
Well, it doesn't make
the anecdote untrue, does it?

193
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,836
My hair is falling out.
You see that?
My back hurts.

194
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,038
Before you know it
I'm gonna be one of
these old guys

195
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,041
walking around
in a wheelchair,
never did anything.

196
00:12:57,043 --> 00:12:59,410
Maybe Amy Lawrence
<i> does</i> think I'm a kid.
Tom.

197
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:03,414
Well, I'm a Toys R Us kid.
And I own my own handgun
and a pretty nice minivan.

198
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:06,151
And I'm tired
of people telling me
what I can and can't do.

199
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:09,921
And I think it's time
that we all did
something valuable.

200
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:12,056
I think it's time
that we all did
something meaningful.

201
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,362
Okay? Now listen to
the oath. Here we go.

202
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:22,333
"By joining this band,
I agree to stay loyal

203
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,569
and not share
any band secrets
with others.

204
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,572
If I do, I agree
to have my throat cut
and a curse put on my head

205
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:30,275
and to be set on fire
and never talked about anymore.

206
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:33,444
I agree that if anybody
hurts a member of the gang,
Tom will appoint someone

207
00:13:33,446 --> 00:13:35,547
to kill the person
who did it."

208
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,216
What about families?
What do you mean?

209
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:41,920
If someone in the gang rats,
we should, like,
kill someone in their family.

210
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,322
We will<i> definitely</i> do that.

211
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,259
Huck doesn't have any family,
so that doesn't seem like
a completely fair trade.

212
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:51,196
What about that old lady
that you live with?

213
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,264
Sure. Yeah. Sure.

214
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,500
I'm cool with that.
We'll just kill her.

215
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:59,003
I was gonna say kill her.
Okay, great. Anyways--

216
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,306
Should I be chosen for the task,
I will not eat or sleep
until I kill them

217
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:04,226
and cut a cross
on their chest.

218
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:07,145
We're gonna use crosses.
You see anybody else doing that,
let me know and we'll kill them.

219
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:10,315
We'll<i> sue</i> them.
Uh, churches.

220
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:14,619
I could only get
the Résumé Wizard open,
so I typed it up that way.

221
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:17,021
But otherwise
I think it's good.

222
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,391
If you guys wanna proofread it
before you sign it, I don't
give a shit. That's fine.

223
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,161
Most of the harsh language
inside this thing
I pulled out of pirate books.

224
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:26,064
I got some out of
the Old Testament.
I don't think Jesus would lie.

225
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:28,466
But in practice
we're gonna be
mostly nonviolent.

226
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:32,537
We're gonna sign in blood.
It's best if you do it--
Uh, Tom, I don't--

227
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,440
I'm gonna quit now.
I'm quitting preemptively here.

228
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:40,478
Thought this whole thing
was like Amway or Herbalife
or something, man.

229
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,280
Which I'd totally be into.

230
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:46,551
But, uh--
I'm gonna go check on Amy.
All right?

231
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,419
I'm sorry.

232
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:54,492
Do we have to kill him?

233
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,128
No, he-he's letting us
use the basement.

234
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,398
All right,
who's with me and Huck?

235
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:06,237
Tom, can I talk to you
out... side?

236
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,674
Yeah. Yeah.

237
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,376
Sure.

238
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,148
See that?

239
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,683
Trojan's Hammer.

240
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:24,222
Listen, uh...

241
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,425
You know I appreciate
you including me in all
of your plans, right?

242
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,227
Yeah. Yeah.

243
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:31,362
But I think, um...

244
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,431
I gotta go straight.

245
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,502
You know, 'cause--
'cause of jail.

246
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:41,039
Jail. Jail. Jail?
I can't--
I can't go back.

247
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:44,208
Over my dead body, man.
You're not going back to jail.

248
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,211
I've got the perfect thing
to help you go straight.

249
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:50,214
It's enough money
to buy an island.
It'd be you and me, man.

250
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,417
I'll be president
of the island, or king.

251
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:55,520
I don't know what
the leadership structure'll be,
but you could be my prince.

252
00:15:55,522 --> 00:15:58,323
Or comptroller.
I don't know
what the jobs will be.

253
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,692
But we'll be
drinking rum janglers.

254
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:03,494
I want a real life,
Tom.

255
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,364
You know?
I want a family.

256
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,000
I can't end up
like my dad.
You got a family. Me.

257
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,403
Us orphans
need to stick together.

258
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,605
Let me give you
the future you want.

259
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:17,008
That's all
I've ever cared about--
us getting the lives we deserve.

260
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,577
Man, if you knew
what I knew,

261
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:22,113
we wouldn't even be
having this conversation.

262
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:28,519
What do you know?
Let me show you.

263
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,522
And then you decide.

264
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:36,394
Okay. Okay.

265
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:50,375
Tom.
I want you to tell them
what you told me.

266
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,276
Hey, Muff.
How's it going, Muff?

267
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,645
Muffin.

268
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:58,149
So this is the crew.
Yeah, this is
Tom Sawyer's gang.

269
00:16:58,151 --> 00:17:01,019
If anybody asks.
D-Don't tell anybody.

270
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:04,389
That's on
a need-to-know basis,
and nobody needs to know.

271
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:07,258
Go ahead.

272
00:17:09,596 --> 00:17:13,498
Well, we all know
the pawn shop

273
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,567
is a holding area
for dirty money
and stolen goods

274
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,137
that need to get cleaned
and distributed.

275
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,410
Yesterday morning

276
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:29,447
they got something
a little more special
than Granny's stolen necklace.

277
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,416
Way better than...
what your grandma
would buy.

278
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,452
Yesterday morning

279
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,654
Injun Joe
brought something by.

280
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,290
Yeah, right.
Injun Joe is not even real.

281
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:40,725
Excuse me?
He's made up.

282
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,528
Hell he is. I know the man.
Disagree to agree.

283
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,531
Huck and me saw him
when we were kids.
I tell you that all the time.

284
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,434
I knew that. Sorry.
Why would he keep anything
in an old pawn shop?

285
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,503
Here's the real news.

286
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:59,110
The way I hear it, he's got
something so valuable he don't
know how to turn it over.

287
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,745
The way I hear it,

288
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,481
he's got Murrel's treasure.

289
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,719
What else could it be?

290
00:18:08,721 --> 00:18:12,557
Everybody knows
Injun's spent his whole life
searching for Murrel's stash.

291
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,193
And there's nobody
protecting it?
Nope.

292
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,295
Just sitting in the safe
below the counter.

293
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,464
No guards, no nothin'.

294
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,399
But nobody else
knows about this.

295
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,102
Good. Good.
You're gonna get
your share.

296
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,503
No shit.

297
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,151
This is it.

298
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,153
You sure
we can trust Muff?

299
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:44,722
Oh, yeah, man.
Muff's legit
as a witch's titty.

300
00:18:44,724 --> 00:18:48,226
He used to hang out
with Injun Joe until
they had a falling out

301
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:51,729
'cause Injun started
cutting the tops
of people's heads off.

302
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:55,433
But we gotta get it
tomorrow morning, man,
before Injun comes back.

303
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,435
You promise
you've really seen him?
Yeah, man.

304
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,438
He's, like,
seven feet tall. Awesome.
He's a big guy.

305
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,507
He's a white guy.
Not even Indian.

306
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:04,909
Why do they call him
Injun Joe then?

307
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:07,512
Guess he identifies
with the culture
and aesthetic.

308
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:09,714
Isn't that
kinda racist?

309
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:13,184
How is it racist
to want to be more
like another race?

310
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:16,354
"Injun" is racist.
That's kind of a slur at the--

311
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:19,490
Imagine if you were,
like, Spic Kenny, Jap Tony.

312
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,760
"I'm just paying homage
to Japanese culture."

313
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:26,898
It's racist to spend this
much time talking about it.
All right, what's the plan?

314
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,435
Operation
Mexican Shadow.
10:00 AM.

315
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:34,405
<i>I'll enter the pawn shop,</i>
<i>acting as if I'm just there</i>
<i>to do some shopping.</i>

316
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,874
<i>10:05 AM.</i>

317
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:41,412
<i>Ben will enter,</i>
<i>also pretending to be</i>
<i>a normal, civilized shopper.</i>

318
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,681
<i>10:07 AM.</i>
<i>Huck Finn, the Red-handed,</i>

319
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,883
<i>and Joe Harper,</i>
<i>the Terror of the Seas,</i>

320
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,919
<i>will be dropped off</i>
<i>by a Mexican man</i>
<i>in a rental van.</i>

321
00:19:47,921 --> 00:19:50,188
Who is this Mexican,
you may ask?

322
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,356
<i>9:22 AM.</i>

323
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:55,259
<i>Huck and Harper will pick up</i>
<i>a random day laborer</i>
<i>from the rental spot</i>

324
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,262
<i>and ask him to drive the van</i>
<i>they will have just rented,</i>

325
00:19:58,264 --> 00:19:59,797
<i>saying neither of you</i>
<i>can drive</i>

326
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:01,599
<i>because of</i>
<i>Operation Iraqi Freedom</i>
<i>injuries.</i>

327
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,868
<i>You will speak</i>
<i>only in "espa?ola"</i>

328
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,970
<i>as you rob the treasure</i>
<i>and safe contents.</i>

329
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,372
<i>When the money</i>
<i>is in the bag,</i>

330
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,909
<i>Joe will cue Ben,</i>
<i>our civilian do-gooder</i>
<i>come to save the day,</i>

331
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:15,413
<i>by saying</i>
<i>"Dead men tell no tales"</i>
<i>in Spanish.</i>

332
00:20:15,415 --> 00:20:17,315
Halt!

333
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,317
What's my name in it?

334
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,319
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

335
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:24,355
It's not a part of
the-the speech.

336
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,757
Huck and Harper
get cool nicknames.
Why can't I get one?

337
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,893
We use your name.
You're the civilian
do-gooder.

338
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:31,896
Then I join up with you.
No, you get taken hostage.

339
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,832
And then I come out
and save the day.

340
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:38,603
<i>My presence keeps them</i>
<i>from calling 911,</i>

341
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,439
<i>while Ben being held hostage</i>
<i>gets you out of there</i>

342
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:44,342
<i>without me having</i>
<i>to arrest you.</i>

343
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:47,945
<i>I see the Latino driver</i>
<i>and remember hearing the robbers</i>
<i>speaking Mexican</i>

344
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:51,582
<i>and say the suspects</i>
<i>are three Latinos.</i>

345
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:54,785
The Mexican driver,
who knows nothing,

346
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:58,789
drops you off, returns the van
and makes the easiest
30 bucks of his life.

347
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,659
<i>Then, when Ben Rogers</i>
<i>is "let go,"</i>

348
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:03,928
<i>he corroborates my story.</i>

349
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,030
Operation

350
00:21:06,032 --> 00:21:08,499
Latin Darkness.

351
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:11,936
The name's not set.
I haven't decided what
the name is gonna be exactly.

352
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,372
Still working on that.

353
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:17,008
Does this mean
we are literally gonna
hold up this pawn shop?

354
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:18,709
We'll be outlaws.

355
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:21,712
I would rather be
an outlaw for one year
in Sherwood Forest

356
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24,282
than president
of the United States

357
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,684
for infinity.

358
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:29,587
And it's Murrel's treasure.
We've been looking for this
our entire lives.

359
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:33,357
And now is our chance
to go down in history
as the gang that found it.

360
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:36,294
What do you think, Huck?

361
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:42,667
Tomorrow morning.

362
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,669
We need to be
at our best.

363
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:47,471
So let's first
get this Huckleberry Finn
welcome-back party

364
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:49,073
up on its feet.

365
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,650
Tom.
In my office.

366
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:43,554
I'm, uh--
I'm actually on my way out.

367
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,556
I'm granting your wish
for more responsibility.

368
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:48,692
Huh? Well, I don't
want responsibility.
I want to be a detective.

369
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:51,429
You're getting a rookie.
What? Who is this guy?

370
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,432
Becky Thatcher?
You may have heard
of Judge Thatcher, her father.

371
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:58,569
My guess is that Ms. Thatcher
will be out of here and in law
school by the end of the year.

372
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:01,038
But in the meantime,
she's riding with you.
Cool. That'll be great.

373
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,941
She starts with you today.
What? No.
That doesn't work for me.

374
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,877
I'm in a... j--
Look after her.

375
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:11,715
Oh, and your brother
is being given the keys
to the city by the mayor,

376
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,484
in case
you want to watch.

377
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:15,052
Fuck that shit.

378
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:18,956
Tom Sawyer?

379
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:23,160
Uh, Becky Thatcher.

380
00:24:23,162 --> 00:24:24,728
I'm Becky Thatcher.

381
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,231
You're Becky?
Mm-hmm.

382
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,233
Oh, okay. Okay--
Yeah, I'm Tom.

383
00:24:29,235 --> 00:24:32,069
I'm your Tom--
I'm your boss.

384
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:34,839
We're--
We're partners, right?

385
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:38,809
If that's what they want,
that's what you shall do.

386
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,245
What?

387
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:43,581
It's not a sentence.

388
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:46,917
I'm-I'm very excited
to get to work with you.

389
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,253
Hey, someone
just puked in the hall.

390
00:24:51,757 --> 00:24:55,226
So... shall we
hit the road?

391
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:57,561
Um... no. No.

392
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,163
Uh, I, uh--

393
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:02,566
I have to drive alone.
For a minute. Just a minute.

394
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:05,603
So if you wanna be in here,
you can get your bearings
in the break room.

395
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:08,539
Well, I-I think I'm--

396
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,908
I'm good
with the break room,
you know.

397
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:15,880
<i> Enchanté.</i>
After you.<i> Enchanté.</i>

398
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,954
Jesus Christ.

399
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:26,957
Hey!
What are you doing?

400
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:31,295
I know, man. I'm late.
I slept through my alarm.

401
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:33,864
We're supposed to have
the driver and the van by now.
I'm sorry!

402
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,934
I think I break-danced
too hard last night.
You got masks?

403
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:39,270
What is that?
What about stockings?

404
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:42,239
Why would I
have stockings?
Why would you-Bags?

405
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:45,609
Why do you have bags?
Because
I just went shopping.

406
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:48,012
Get in the back.

407
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:52,249
<i> Hola. Hola.</i>
Hi. Hi.

408
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,151
You drive a car?

409
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:57,154
<i> S?.</i>
No, not your truck.

410
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:59,823
I'll give you
<i> treinta d?lares--</i>

411
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:02,159
<i>?Treinta d?lares?</i>
Yeah.

412
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:05,029
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

413
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:08,032
It's okay.
She won't care. It's fine.

414
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:09,767
You can finish later.
Come on.

415
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:11,068
<i> Buongiorno.</i>

416
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:16,240
Let's drive.
Drive, drive, drive.

417
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:21,111
Um, wait.

418
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,314
Like turn.

419
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:27,151
So you, uh--
you wanna be a cop?

420
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:30,020
I<i> am</i> a cop.
Yeah. Cool.

421
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:32,122
That's great.
I'm a cop. Gum?

422
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:35,626
No, thanks. I'm good.
To be honest,
this is not my normal duty.

423
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:38,662
Typically, I'm handling
homicides, you know.
Missing persons.

424
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:40,264
Oh, really?
Normally I'm more
of a detective.

425
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,733
So...<i> c'est la vie.</i>

426
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:45,035
Not supposed to chew gum
if you have braces.
You ever have braces?

427
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,304
When I was a kid.
I wanted braces
when I was a kid.

428
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:49,673
My aunt told me
I don't need them.
Now I do.

429
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:52,041
Like I'm gonna walk around the
police station with braces on.
Spare me the trouble.

430
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:54,745
You worry about the braces.
I'll worry about
the missing persons.

431
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:56,914
Are you nervous?
No, I'm good.

432
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:59,717
Good. I'm good.
I'm good too.

433
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:02,653
I'm just trying
to get to know you.
I have a lot of interests.

434
00:27:02,655 --> 00:27:05,122
Like dual lives.
Two completely dual lives.

435
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:07,858
Like a lover
and a fighter.

436
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,227
And a detective.

437
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:12,963
I'm gonna have to make
a quick stop on the way.

438
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,970
This is where
you need to stop?
Have to go to the bathroom.

439
00:27:19,972 --> 00:27:23,107
At a pawn shop?
I always go here.

440
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:25,309
Why didn't you go
at the station?
What? I did.

441
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:27,945
Listen, could you
just watch the car?

442
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:31,782
Wait here and watch the car
for two seconds.
I'm gonna be two seconds.

443
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:33,117
Okay.
Okay.

444
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:57,007
I'm just doing a little
on-duty shopping.

445
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,376
Um, you guys... got this.

446
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,035
Hey.

447
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:28,038
Hey, Ben. Ben.

448
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,475
Oh, um-Listen. No.

449
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,477
Ben. Don't look at me.

450
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,179
What are you doing?

451
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:37,281
You said don't look at you.
I was looking at this.

452
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:40,150
We gotta cancel.
I have a girl with me.

453
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,386
Is she your girlfriend?
Maybe.

454
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:45,255
I don't know.
We just have to cancel.
That's good.

455
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:48,025
I got so drunk, man,
I can't even remember
the whole plan.

456
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:50,928
Can I help
either of you guys
find anything?

457
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,896
Huh? What? No.
I don't know him.

458
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,499
I'm just passing through.
Passing through?

459
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:58,902
Yeah. If that was even me
that you're thinking of.

460
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,438
I don't know him.
The name's Greg.

461
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,209
Greg Knife.

462
00:29:07,113 --> 00:29:10,481
Great, Greg.
Well, good to meet you.

463
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:12,182
Both.

464
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:15,085
Just gotta make a call.

465
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:24,161
Sorry. Does that
sometimes. I'm sorry.
Harper!

466
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,900
I'm not good
with Spanish.
It's fine, it's fine.

467
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:32,202
Leave the car running
for one second.

468
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:35,773
Get it running, okay?
<i>?S??</i>
<i> S?.</i>

469
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:39,143
We're picking up supplies,
and neither one of us can drive
'cause of Iraq. Let's go.

470
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:42,546
Leave the phone.
We're late. Let's go.

471
00:29:44,416 --> 00:29:47,151
<i> You've reached Joe Harper.</i>
<i> Leave a message.</i>

472
00:29:47,153 --> 00:29:49,353
Hey, Harper.
We gotta cancel.

473
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:52,156
We need to call it off.
Call me back.

474
00:29:57,997 --> 00:30:00,330
Mexico!

475
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:02,232
<i> ?Dinero!</i>

476
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,868
Aaah!
<i>Dinero.</i>

477
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,171
<i> Dinero. Dine--</i>

478
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,539
Shit.

479
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:13,977
Uh--

480
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,346
<i> ?S?!</i>
Money, jewels, pronto!

481
00:30:16,348 --> 00:30:18,148
Listen, dumb-ass.

482
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,485
The last time somebody
tried this, they got
their hair cut real short.

483
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:24,922
Do you know what that means?
Uh,<i> no ingles.</i>

484
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:30,294
Just--

485
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:39,903
"Coka-roka."

486
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:50,214
Dead men
t-tell no tales, man.

487
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:52,049
No. Nobody needs
to get hurt.

488
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,521
My name is Greg.

489
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,223
A civilian!

490
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:01,358
Why is he wearing a mask?
I don't know.

491
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,560
What are you doing?

492
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:08,565
Freeze, Latinos!

493
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:29,019
Don't hurt the hostage.
He's not a hostage.
He's wearing a mask.

494
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:33,523
No, he-he-he's
an innocent civilian.
And he has a skin condition.

495
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:37,527
No one has to get hurt.
I'm trained for this.
Just cooperate, okay?

496
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,165
I got it under control.

497
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,901
You're making
a big mistake, boys.

498
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:48,939
Freeze!
Stand down, Becky!
Stand down. Stand down.

499
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:52,342
These guys have a hostage.
These Mexican guys
have a hostage.

500
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:54,611
Come on, come on.
Let's go.

501
00:31:54,613 --> 00:31:56,947
Follow us,
and we shoot him.
<i> Caliente.</i>

502
00:31:56,949 --> 00:31:59,950
Be "el cool-o."
Nobody has to get hurt.
Let's be calm.

503
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:03,186
And no one kills anybody.

504
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:05,122
Good.<i> Buono! Buono!</i>

505
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:07,157
Station 1,
this is 6-Charlie-6.
We have a--

506
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,959
Wait. No, no, no, no.
What?

507
00:32:08,961 --> 00:32:11,428
The main Mexican's put
a gun to the guy's head.

508
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,598
If you follow him,
he'll kill him there.

509
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,366
We just--
We let them go?

510
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:22,239
Goddamn it!
Seems like they'd be
in a rental van.

511
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,144
They drove me out
to the middle of nowhere,

512
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:30,547
took the blindfold off,
then they let me go.

513
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:34,318
The three...
Mexican Latinos.

514
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,520
Did you notice
anything specific
about the men?

515
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,989
Any tattoos or markings
or piercings?

516
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:42,059
Yeah, they had tattoos
and piercings and stuff.

517
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:44,661
So they had all three?
Yeah, I think so.

518
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:48,398
One of them had a tattoo
of the Spanish flag

519
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,301
and a mermaid
riding a snake.

520
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:57,574
So how does a mermaid
ride a snake, exactly?

521
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:59,242
Sidesaddle.

522
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:05,716
Sidesaddle,
so it's snake, saddle,

523
00:33:05,718 --> 00:33:09,019
mermaid... chillin'
in the saddle.

524
00:33:10,456 --> 00:33:14,024
Directin',
whippin' for speed.
Et cetera.

525
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:17,094
Stop.
Sidesaddle.

526
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:19,529
So the snake
had a saddle on it?

527
00:33:22,768 --> 00:33:25,502
Yeah, I think so.
Can you describe the saddle?

528
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,238
It's, uh, brown.

529
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,073
It's brown.
Tom, do you need
to be here?

530
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,546
Yeah. No.

531
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,588
Uh, are you mad at me?

532
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,456
Uh, no. I was--

533
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,625
I was exercising.
You were great.

534
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:51,528
I should have been there
for you. I could have
helped you, and I didn't.

535
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,665
No, you're fantastic.
You know, you were
on time with a gun.

536
00:33:55,667 --> 00:34:00,170
I just-When hostages
are there, you can't
do it different than that.

537
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:02,372
I will be better
from here on out.

538
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,374
No, Becky,

539
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,710
I think you're terrific,
and I'm glad that
we're gonna be partners.

540
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:10,180
Tom.

541
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:12,382
Uh, will you take
Mr. Knife home?

542
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:21,291
If you wanna get a Moped,
I'm not gonna stop you.

543
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,562
What are you doing?
This is the meeting place.

544
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:28,265
Uh, no. I'm not
doing the... thing.

545
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:30,734
You said we could use
the man cave. You can't
just take it back now.

546
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:32,602
That was
a one-time thing.
All right?

547
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:36,606
Well?
It's okay.
It's all right.

548
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,508
Nobody knows anything.
Knows anything
about what?

549
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,677
What the hell happened?
Where'd the other cop
come from?

550
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,612
Don't worry about her.
Cop? Hold on.

551
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:45,248
She was gonna shoot us.
Am I an accessory to murder?

552
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,717
I tried to call you.
Should I have not
joined up with you?

553
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:51,254
You answer that question.
Do you think so?
I needed a name.

554
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:54,091
I'm not being an accessory.
Enough, enough, enough. Quiet.

555
00:34:54,093 --> 00:34:56,460
Nobody got caught, okay?

556
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:58,462
We got the treasure, right?

557
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:02,365
We were waiting
for you.

558
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,638
What is that?

559
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:12,609
Uh--

560
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:17,481
All right.

561
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:20,750
Let's do it.

562
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:22,319
Okay.
All right.

563
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,387
Let's see what we got.

564
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:28,625
Ready?
Yeah.

565
00:35:42,274 --> 00:35:44,241
Where's the rest?

566
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:46,176
Where's the gold
and shit?

567
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:50,380
I'll bet that's not
even $200.

568
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:52,449
Did you rob him right?

569
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:57,621
'Cause I said
it was in the safe
under the counter.

570
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:00,524
They went in the safe.
We got everything they had.

571
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:02,692
This is--
Well, it's not bad.
It's not bad.

572
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:05,562
I would say this is
more than $200.

573
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:08,932
Look at that.
That's no ordinary coin.

574
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:12,435
That's not precious metal.
That's pewter.

575
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,437
Shit, man. That's not
even a Susan B. Anthony.

576
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:19,276
All right, Huck, let's--
let's divide it up.

577
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:21,478
Divide up what, Tom?

578
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,713
The spoils, man.
Everybody gets their share.

579
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,917
Their share of what?
Of Murrel's treasure?

580
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:30,253
This isn't
Murrel's treasure, Tom.
250.

581
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,688
It's pocket change.

582
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:34,858
Muff led us on.

583
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,933
You gonna divide that up
into four shares?

584
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:44,734
Five.
Five?

585
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,703
Muff still gets a share.
I'm out of here.

586
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,839
Wait. Huck, come on.
Huck. Huck.
Who gives a shit?

587
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:57,714
You know what?
Let's do this later.

588
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,849
I'll hold on to this.

589
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,954
Huck!

590
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:06,423
Do we kill that lady
he lives with now?

591
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:09,926
Told you so.
Told you so. Told you so.

592
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:34,584
Meow!
Meow.

593
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:37,320
Meow. How did you
climb up here?

594
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:39,823
Coming into your house.
I didn't want to wake up
the old lady.

595
00:37:41,727 --> 00:37:45,729
We have to look at this
for what it really is. Okay?

596
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:49,566
We had an adventure.
Nobody got hurt. We're all
a few bucks richer.

597
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:52,802
Tom, the situation is,
we put ourselves
in danger again.

598
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:55,338
For nothing.
We got some money.

599
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,574
There's no money!
I have to pay Jorge.

600
00:37:57,576 --> 00:37:59,809
I gotta give him $30.
The driver.

601
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:02,512
I'm barely gonna
break even on this.

602
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:05,749
All right. Well, you
can be the one who gets
the special coin then.

603
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:17,761
The woman I live with
keeps telling me
that I need to change.

604
00:38:17,763 --> 00:38:19,796
She says if I don't change,

605
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:22,032
I'm gonna end up
in a bad place.

606
00:38:22,034 --> 00:38:25,669
Told her
I wished I already was
in the bad place.

607
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:27,604
She's tryin' to sell me
on heaven.

608
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:30,373
She's telling me
that all you do all day

609
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:33,576
is you play a harp,
sit there and sing songs
for all eternity.

610
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:36,579
And I said to her,
"If that's the case,
I'd rather sit there

611
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,548
and sweat it out in hell

612
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,017
with my best friend
Tom Sawyer

613
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:44,754
than play the harp and--
and shoot the shit with Moses."

614
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:47,390
I'm not friends with Moses.
Exactly, man.

615
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:48,925
You're not friends
with Moses.

616
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,493
But...

617
00:38:51,596 --> 00:38:54,064
I do think she's right.

618
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,668
At least about
the changing part.

619
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,036
I just--

620
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,007
I gotta be through
with this.

621
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:09,779
Through with what?
I just got out of prison, Tom.

622
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:12,849
And today,
I came this close

623
00:39:13,919 --> 00:39:15,785
to going back.

624
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:19,522
For what?
For a couple of bucks?

625
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,026
A couple of bucks
and a rusty coin?

626
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,794
Hmm.

627
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:27,664
I guess just, uh...
dig a hole

628
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,966
and drop me
inside of it.

629
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:33,536
Throw some gasoline on it,
throw some fire on it,
throw a grenade on it, kill me.

630
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:35,572
I don't wanna live
a life like that.

631
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,376
Just going with the flow,
you know?

632
00:39:39,378 --> 00:39:42,379
Never doing anything,
just hoping you get by okay.

633
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,783
When I die,

634
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:49,486
I want there
to be a parade.

635
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:53,156
I want the newsman to say,
"We just lost
the number-one best guy,

636
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:56,726
Tom Sawyer, child prodigy,
grown-up genius, American hero."

637
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,396
We look over
at the weather girl.
She's crying.

638
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:01,464
We look over
at the sports guy.
He's crying.

639
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:03,783
He doesn't cry.
He's a sports guy.

640
00:40:03,784 --> 00:40:06,101
But he's crying because
Tom Sawyer died, because
he did something with his life.

641
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:07,971
Lot of people don't care
what happens in life.

642
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:09,940
They just want ham
on their pizza.

643
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,908
They want to watch teenagers
get voted off of contests
on television.

644
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,544
But you and me,
we're not like that.

645
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:18,014
You and me are the types of guys
that other people
tell stories about.

646
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:20,850
We're the types of people
who are gonna be remembered.

647
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,685
As what?

648
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,621
As heroes.

649
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:28,091
Heroes.

650
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:33,930
It's true, man.
I'm just calling it
the way I see it.

651
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:38,668
You got a way
about you.

652
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,504
A way
of turning things.
Yeah.

653
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:42,839
A way of turning...

654
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:46,676
a pewter coin into

655
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:48,745
buried treasure.

656
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:55,084
What's the matter?

657
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:57,854
I've seen this.
Seen what?

658
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,823
This.

659
00:41:02,694 --> 00:41:04,661
I've seen this symbol.

660
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:10,867
I've seen this. It's, uh--
I've seen this symbol
in-in the graveyard.

661
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:13,536
I saw this symbol
on a tombstone.
I've seen it.

662
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,939
What if Muff was wrong?

663
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:18,842
What if it's<i> not</i>
Murrel's treasure
in the pawn shop?

664
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:22,879
What if it's a clue...
to finding it?

665
00:41:22,881 --> 00:41:24,747
That means
Injun doesn't have it.

666
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:26,749
Are you kidding me?
No, no.

667
00:41:26,751 --> 00:41:28,718
You genius.
He's still
looking for it.

668
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,054
You child prodigy.
You American hero.
Injun's looking, same as us.

669
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:37,026
That's funny.

670
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:41,231
He was telling a joke
from the Bible.
It was a good Bible joke.

671
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,754
Muff!

672
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,625
You messed up, Muff!

673
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:15,198
Muff!

674
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,101
You messed up bad, Muff.

675
00:42:24,276 --> 00:42:26,075
Muff!

676
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:31,047
I think it's up this way.

677
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,149
I've never been
in an orgy.

678
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:36,619
What made you think of that?

679
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:39,722
I think it's just seeing
all these people on their backs,
so close together.

680
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:41,824
What kind of person
<i> likes</i> orgies?
Pirates, man. Hands down.

681
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:44,193
No pun intended.

682
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:47,864
Those guys, if they weren't
setting shit on fire or robbing
banks, they were having an orgy.

683
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:50,600
Is that true?
Yeah. That's breakfast
for a pirate.

684
00:42:50,602 --> 00:42:53,136
Those guys wake up,
have coffee,
then they have an orgy.

685
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:56,005
See, I don't think
I'd like it.

686
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:59,142
Think it'd be too easy
to get confused.

687
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:02,645
Yeah, but you gotta realize,
all intimacy is like that.

688
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:05,281
Huck.
Shit.

689
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:11,120
No, no, no, no--
Ohh!

690
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:13,623
Huck.
Shit.

691
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:16,059
He beat us to it.
Uh, Tom--

692
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:19,062
There's gotta be
some coins in here
or something.

693
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:24,667
They were just here.

694
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:26,302
Shit.

695
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,940
-

696
00:43:32,978 --> 00:43:34,644
What is that?

697
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:36,312
It's me
almost getting murdered.

698
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:37,981
No, Tom.

699
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:43,987
What is<i> that?</i>

700
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:07,043
Let me see that.

701
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,714
Huck. Huck.

702
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:14,684
This is like
an old-timey treasure map.

703
00:44:14,686 --> 00:44:17,353
I'm dreamt about
stuff like this.
Talk about pirates!

704
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:21,124
I'll bet you anything
that these keys
open up a safe

705
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:24,427
or a chest or...
something in a cave

706
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:26,729
marked on this map.

707
00:44:26,731 --> 00:44:30,199
Why's the treasure in a grave?
There was no treasure
in the grave. No.

708
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:34,437
This is what pirates do.
They leave a map or a code
that needs to be ciphered.

709
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:37,373
This is typical,
classic pirate bullshit.
Fell for it again.

710
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:40,910
Do you think Injun Joe
was here?

711
00:44:40,912 --> 00:44:42,812
Maybe.

712
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:44,747
But whoever was here,

713
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:47,450
they don't know
where the treasure is
and we do.

714
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:49,318
We do.

715
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,189
You'll be coming with me.
Now.

716
00:45:24,856 --> 00:45:26,856
Station 1,
this is 6-Charlie-6.

717
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:29,792
We have a possible 211
at pawn shop on St. Petersburg.

718
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:35,064
Crap.

719
00:45:42,474 --> 00:45:44,907
Ah, yes, yes.

720
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:55,118
Shit.

721
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:06,262
Freeze!

722
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:11,968
You are under arrest for
the robbing of this pawn shop.

723
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,970
You have the right
to remain silent.

724
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:16,005
Anything you say now
could be held against you
in a court of law.

725
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:17,340
I got you.

726
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:22,345
Is no problem.

727
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:25,281
Don't come any closer, sir!
On the ground!

728
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:29,786
Hands in the air.

729
00:46:32,557 --> 00:46:35,191
Please put your hands
in the air.

730
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:47,036
My family, se?orita.
My family.

731
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:49,872
Is no problem.
Please.

732
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:52,141
Well, you<i> do</i>
have a problem, sir,
I'm sorry to say.

733
00:46:53,545 --> 00:46:56,212
Now,

734
00:46:56,214 --> 00:47:00,349
I can help you find the number
for a Spanish lawyer
that might be able to help you.

735
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:03,553
Uh...

736
00:47:03,555 --> 00:47:05,421
Everything's
going to be okay.

737
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:09,258
Don't move.

738
00:47:13,031 --> 00:47:14,897
Here we go.

739
00:47:14,899 --> 00:47:16,399
Here we go.

740
00:47:21,606 --> 00:47:24,340
Come on.
Keep goin'.

741
00:47:24,342 --> 00:47:26,442
Keep going.
Go on.

742
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,311
All the way to the back.

743
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:32,348
Go on.

744
00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:37,320
Sir, I'd just like to say
that somebody else
dug that hole.

745
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,893
The phone's upstairs.

746
00:47:43,895 --> 00:47:46,095
You open this door

747
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:48,497
even a little crack,

748
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:50,366
I will plug your ass.

749
00:47:57,108 --> 00:47:58,241
Whoa.

750
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,052
We should go.

751
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,154
Yeah.

752
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,965
Whoa, whoa. Whoa.

753
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:19,622
You'd be better off
showing yourself.

754
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:22,191
You hear me?

755
00:49:22,193 --> 00:49:24,226
I know you're in here.

756
00:49:24,228 --> 00:49:26,295
And if you're in here,
you better--

757
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:36,605
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Look what you did, Muff.

758
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:42,545
You killed him
and anybody else who dies

759
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:45,147
'cause you opened
your big mouth.

760
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:48,751
Well, they're
around here somewhere.

761
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:52,288
So let's find 'em.

762
00:50:30,661 --> 00:50:33,229
Joe. Over here.
I found a trail of dirt.

763
00:50:33,231 --> 00:50:35,564
Over here.

764
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:37,700
Hopefully you ain't
wasting my time, Muff.

765
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:06,762
Go on, Packard.

766
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:16,105
Turn it off!
Turn it off!

767
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:17,473
I'm trying!

768
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:51,807
Let's go.

769
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:09,625
Get in! Get in!

770
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,734
God! Oh, shit.

771
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:21,537
That was him, Tom.
Oh, my God.
That was Injun Joe.

772
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:24,140
<i>FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:</i>
<i>You have a new mail message.</i>

773
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:25,908
<i> BECKY:</i>
<i> Tom, I got the driver</i>
<i> from the robbery.</i>

774
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:27,476
<i> Call me back.</i>

775
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:30,613
Shit. My partner
got your driver.

776
00:52:30,615 --> 00:52:33,616
What?
You know what?
He takes the fall.

777
00:52:33,618 --> 00:52:36,652
He didn't have a gun.
He's an illegal. Those guys
get pinched all the time.

778
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,621
They get a slap on the wrist,
they send them back.

779
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:42,825
Shit!
It's not okay, Tom.
He knows me.

780
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:45,394
What do you mean,
he knows you?
I mean he knows me.

781
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:48,931
He works for the widow.
He knows me.
What was the plan, Huck?

782
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:51,834
Day laborer.
Mexican stranger.
I know, and he was--

783
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:53,602
A stranger!
He was a stranger.

784
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,905
A Mexican stranger.
I know the plan!
He is a stranger!

785
00:52:55,907 --> 00:52:58,407
How is he a stranger
if he knows you?
We ran out of time.

786
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:00,910
How is he a stranger
if he knows you? Shit!

787
00:53:00,912 --> 00:53:02,711
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

788
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:04,880
It's fine. It's fine.

789
00:53:06,317 --> 00:53:08,184
It's fine. I'll call her.

790
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:13,956
<i> Hello?</i>
Becky.

791
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:16,458
Tom. I got him.

792
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,227
You're not gonna
believe this.

793
00:53:18,229 --> 00:53:20,629
He came back
to the scene of the crime.
I called it in.

794
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:23,465
Becky, just wait.
If the other squad car comes,
tell 'em to wait.

795
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:25,568
Just have everyone, uh--
Operation Mexican Wait There.

796
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:30,339
Wh--

797
00:53:32,243 --> 00:53:33,609
He said to wait.

798
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:42,718
What are you gonna do?
I'm working on it.

799
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:54,997
Hey.
Hey. Let's go.

800
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:57,499
What?
The other station called,
told me to pick you up.

801
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:58,867
We gotta go, okay?
After I talked to you?

802
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:01,470
I'll explain everything
on the way, okay?

803
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:04,974
Ready? One, two.

804
00:54:04,976 --> 00:54:06,976
You're gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you home.
Who's this?

805
00:54:06,978 --> 00:54:08,978
Special Agent
George Jackson.
Special agent?

806
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:13,749
No problem, Jorge.
No, no, no.

807
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:18,621
Huck, where am I going?

808
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,489
I thought his name
was George.
It is.

809
00:54:20,491 --> 00:54:22,992
I just didn't-I was like,
fuck, where am I going?

810
00:54:22,994 --> 00:54:24,827
You know?

811
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:26,729
Oh, no, no.
Who is that,
your boyfriend?

812
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:30,299
Look, there's no-no calls.
Uh, no phones.

813
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:31,967
You're not gonna
believe this, okay?

814
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:34,470
You've just been roped
into one of the most secret
missions of all time.

815
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:36,538
This guy George Jackson
is under cover.

816
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,407
This Mexican,
he's his top informant.

817
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:40,376
You bring that guy in,
you blow the whole thing.

818
00:54:40,378 --> 00:54:41,744
Oh, my God.
No, no, no.

819
00:54:41,746 --> 00:54:44,063
I'm so embarrassed.
Don't be embarrassed.

820
00:54:44,064 --> 00:54:46,381
If I saw this guy,
I would have arrested him.
You couldn't have known.

821
00:54:46,384 --> 00:54:48,417
It's all right.
Says it's a cave, Tom.

822
00:54:48,419 --> 00:54:51,920
I don't-I don't know
what it means by-by a cave.
There's no cave around.

823
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:54,323
There's gotta be a cave.
There's no cave
around here, Tom.

824
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:56,458
There's gotta be, Huck.
George.
Okay, wait a minute.

825
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:01,797
That gotta be Old Main
If that's Old Main,
then that's Sherburn Way.

826
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,633
By the river.
Old Main and Sherburn Way.
Old Main and Sherburn Way.

827
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:07,936
Okay. All right.
I'm just gonna make one more
phone call, and then no phones.

828
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:10,472
<i>You've reached Joe Harper.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

829
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:13,309
Harper? Uh, yeah, it's Tom.
Listen, um, we know
where the rest is.

830
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:16,645
Okay? So meet us
at Old Main and Sherburn Way
in 30 minutes.

831
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,881
And pick up Ben
and meet us there.

832
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:21,483
Who's that?
Another detective.

833
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,686
This case is huge
and totally secret.

834
00:55:24,855 --> 00:55:26,822
Geez Louise.

835
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:39,835
Huh?

836
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:48,544
Sorry to interrupt.
My name is Joe.
What's your name?

837
00:55:50,614 --> 00:55:52,381
Joe.

838
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:54,950
That's pretty interesting, man.
We got the same name.

839
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:57,586
We're in the same car.

840
00:55:57,588 --> 00:55:59,488
That's life, I guess.

841
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:02,491
Three meals a day
and funny moments like these.

842
00:56:03,761 --> 00:56:06,495
You're, um--
You're Injun Joe.

843
00:56:06,497 --> 00:56:08,364
Some people
call me that.

844
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:13,502
Why do they call you that
if you're not even
native Indian?

845
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:17,773
I guess I just identify
with the culture
and the aesthetic.

846
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:20,709
Isn't that
kind of racist?

847
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:24,079
How is it racist
to want to be more

848
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:27,149
like another race?

849
00:56:27,151 --> 00:56:29,618
Yeah.

850
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:35,724
Where are your friends?

851
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:38,560
Please. Please.

852
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,929
All right.

853
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:44,166
Oh, take it easy.
We're just talking.

854
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:47,069
I'm gonna tell you
something true from my life

855
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,972
that might bind us closer.

856
00:56:49,974 --> 00:56:54,176
When I was young,
I lived on the street.

857
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:56,845
Mostly under
the Hannibal Bridge.
You know the bridge?

858
00:56:56,847 --> 00:56:59,515
This man came around.

859
00:56:59,517 --> 00:57:03,118
He was offering me a job.
I did the job and I did it good.

860
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:06,855
One day, the man decided
I was no longer useful.

861
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:09,558
So, he and a couple
of his big boys

862
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,894
took me back to that bridge
where I used to sleep

863
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:14,430
and they put a bullet
in my face.

864
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:17,566
Right here. There.

865
00:57:17,568 --> 00:57:19,501
You see the scar?
Yeah.

866
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:22,037
Not this scar.

867
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:25,107
This one came later.

868
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:27,643
I'm telling you about
this one 'cause I think
it's more relatable

869
00:57:27,645 --> 00:57:30,045
to what's going on now.

870
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:31,613
Boom.

871
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,449
But here's the thing, Joe.

872
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:35,617
I lived.

873
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:39,588
For some crazy,
freak-of-nature type thing,
I survived.

874
00:57:39,590 --> 00:57:43,859
And I got better,
and I got healthy again,
and you know what?

875
00:57:43,861 --> 00:57:46,962
I pulled myself up
by the straps of my sneakers

876
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:49,531
and I went down to where
that man liked to hang out

877
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:52,034
and I scalped him.

878
00:57:52,036 --> 00:57:55,237
I cut his hands off
and I took his eyes out,

879
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:58,073
and that's how I got
this other scar.

880
00:57:58,075 --> 00:58:00,042
I got so carried away
I didn't realize

881
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:03,212
I was cutting myself
along with the man.

882
00:58:03,214 --> 00:58:05,581
But in the end,
here's the thing.

883
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:09,585
I lived, and he died.

884
00:58:09,587 --> 00:58:12,020
You see what I mean?

885
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:17,960
All we can do
is... what we can do.

886
00:58:17,962 --> 00:58:20,629
The rest is pretty random.

887
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:25,667
You may get out of this maybe,
and maybe I won't.

888
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:27,503
Who can tell
what's gonna happen?

889
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:34,176
Joe, you just tell me
where your friends are,

890
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:36,712
and you can walk away
from this.

891
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:45,787
Shh, shh, shh.

892
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:47,122
Peaceful.

893
00:59:07,745 --> 00:59:11,613
This isn't right.
It's where the map
says to go.

894
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:14,950
All right. Let's, uh--
Let's check it out.

895
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:29,898
What are we doing, George?
There's nothing here.
There's no cave.

896
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,633
I don't know.

897
00:59:33,704 --> 00:59:37,806
Okay. Why don't we, uh,
uncuff the Mexican.

898
00:59:37,808 --> 00:59:39,775
Huh? Okay.

899
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:46,782
Huck, we gotta be fast, okay?
I'll keep her out of the way.
I might get her a room.

900
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:48,150
What's going to happen here?

901
00:59:48,152 --> 00:59:51,186
Well, me and my associate,
we have a, uh, meeting

902
00:59:51,188 --> 00:59:53,055
with the cartel.

903
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:54,990
This place is hot
with cartel like crazy.

904
00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:56,992
So we're gonna keep you
out of the way.

905
00:59:56,994 --> 01:00:00,329
We should get you in a room
where you can lay low.
Anything I can do to help?

906
01:00:00,331 --> 01:00:02,030
You could lay low.
That would be great.

907
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:04,866
You can do us proud.
Just go lay low.

908
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:07,135
Okay. Okay.
It'll be good.

909
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:19,314
Hi.

910
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:22,250
My, uh--

911
01:00:22,252 --> 01:00:26,722
My wife, Roxanne, and I
would like a hotel room

912
01:00:26,724 --> 01:00:29,091
for, um-for, uh,

913
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:31,159
20 minutes.

914
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:34,830
We can do that.
Great. Thank you.

915
01:00:34,832 --> 01:00:36,898
I'll let you sign.
Okay.

916
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:39,067
I'm gonna give you
the corner room.

917
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:41,003
The owner
used to live there.
Oh.

918
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:44,172
He's dead.
The bed is small,
but there's a bathtub.

919
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:48,043
There. Oh, wow.
That's...

920
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:50,178
old-fashioned.

921
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,014
Sure.

922
01:00:54,218 --> 01:00:57,653
There's gotta be a cave.
There's a cave on the map.

923
01:00:57,655 --> 01:01:00,889
Cave on the map.
Think, Huck. Think, Huck.

924
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:03,792
Uh--

925
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:12,367
Okay?

926
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:15,971
We're gonna get you home.
Right after we
find this cave.

927
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:20,409
What?<i> ?Qué?</i>

928
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:56,845
God.

929
01:01:56,847 --> 01:01:58,714
Jorge, I'm sorry.

930
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:03,919
I shouldn't have--
Stupid.

931
01:02:03,921 --> 01:02:06,488
I shouldn't have--
Yeah.

932
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:09,124
I'm gonna get Tom.

933
01:02:09,126 --> 01:02:10,859
Be right back.

934
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:23,905
So, what are we
supposed to do now?

935
01:02:25,476 --> 01:02:29,111
Um, I might have to, uh,
just pop out,

936
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:31,813
have a quick word
with Agent Jackson
about the mission.

937
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:35,083
Some first day, huh?

938
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:36,985
First date?

939
01:02:36,987 --> 01:02:38,353
Did you say
"first date"?

940
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:40,756
First-First<i> date?</i>

941
01:02:40,758 --> 01:02:42,457
Yeah.
No.

942
01:02:42,459 --> 01:02:44,259
No, I said "first day."

943
01:02:44,261 --> 01:02:46,995
First--

944
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:48,797
First date!
First date!

945
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:50,332
Yeah, right.
Oh, my God.

946
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:52,934
Quite-Quite a first day
as partners.

947
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:54,503
Oh.
I mean--

948
01:02:54,505 --> 01:02:56,938
Yeah, I wish this was
just a date.

949
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,274
I don't know why
they placed me with you.

950
01:02:59,276 --> 01:03:03,044
I mean, uh, because of
all the intense detective
stuff they have me doing.

951
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:04,813
I'm glad we're together.
Yeah.

952
01:03:04,815 --> 01:03:06,348
I'm glad they
put us together.

953
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:08,250
It's just
the timing is crazy.

954
01:03:08,252 --> 01:03:10,819
It's--
It's crazy, the timing.

955
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:13,255
Can I make a confession?

956
01:03:13,257 --> 01:03:14,890
Yeah.

957
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,528
I asked
to be placed with you.

958
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:22,364
What?
Yeah.

959
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:26,301
You just--
You just seem different.

960
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:33,108
I don't know.
It just seems like you
want to do something big.

961
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:36,478
Like more than
the status quo, I guess.

962
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,114
Yeah.
I mean, that's, uh--

963
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:42,918
That's classic me.
I just feel like that's
the kind of guts it takes.

964
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,286
You gotta--

965
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:47,889
You gotta go
for stuff in life.

966
01:03:49,393 --> 01:03:50,959
You know?

967
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:55,163
"First date."

968
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:59,201
What part of this--
I was like, what?

969
01:03:59,203 --> 01:04:02,204
I'm over here wondering
if you do have a boyfriend.
Have you been engaged?

970
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:05,874
No, I do not have
a boyfriend.

971
01:04:07,911 --> 01:04:10,245
Just a new partner.

972
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:14,015
What-Becky.

973
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:16,985
What is this?
The room key.

974
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:18,887
This is the room key?
Uh-huh.

975
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:22,057
I didn't--
This is the room key?
Yes.

976
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:24,259
This is what
the room key looks like.
That's what it looks like.

977
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:27,429
This is what
the room key looks like.
Yes.

978
01:04:27,431 --> 01:04:30,932
Can you wait here?
Just wait here.

979
01:04:30,934 --> 01:04:32,300
Tom!

980
01:04:38,075 --> 01:04:39,441
Tom!

981
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:48,583
Huck, this is what
the room keys look like.

982
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:50,952
Look at this.
Cavern's not a cave.

983
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:53,655
Cavern's a hotel.
This place used to be
the Cavern Hotel.

984
01:04:53,657 --> 01:04:56,124
This is the cavern.
We're in the cavern.
Yeah.

985
01:04:56,126 --> 01:04:58,126
The treasure is here.
Yeah.

986
01:04:58,128 --> 01:05:00,328
The treasure is here.
Let's go find it.

987
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:03,565
You go upstairs, okay?
You try the doors.

988
01:05:03,567 --> 01:05:05,333
I'll do the doors
downstairs.
All right.

989
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:07,435
Let's go.
Okay.

990
01:05:07,437 --> 01:05:08,503
Okay.

991
01:05:10,274 --> 01:05:12,540
Hey, uh, we had a break
in the case,

992
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:15,310
and I just gotta see
if there-if there, uh--

993
01:05:15,312 --> 01:05:17,312
if they're gonna put the bugs
and the drugs--

994
01:05:17,314 --> 01:05:19,648
The cartel might have
ended up showing up.

995
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:21,683
Okay. Do you need help?

996
01:05:21,685 --> 01:05:23,652
No. No, no, no.
I can do that.

997
01:05:23,654 --> 01:05:26,955
Yeah. You just wait here,
and I'll be right back.
Okay, partner?

998
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:01,583
It's in our room.

999
01:07:01,585 --> 01:07:04,619
You think I'm
some kind of idiot?
Oh! Oh, God!

1000
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:07,055
What are you doing? Ow!

1001
01:07:07,057 --> 01:07:09,457
You want to do good?
You want to be a hero?

1002
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:12,093
Ah. Becky, don't--
What am I doing?

1003
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:14,095
Look at me.
Oh, my God.

1004
01:07:14,097 --> 01:07:16,498
Oh, God!

1005
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,633
Okay.

1006
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:21,469
Okay, I'm sorry.
It's a secret mission.
I wanted to tell you.

1007
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,304
Uh--

1008
01:07:23,306 --> 01:07:25,373
Listen, don't call the police.
Don't call the police.

1009
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:29,644
I'm the cops. I'm the police.
Oh, witches' tits!
Witches' tits!

1010
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:33,181
Yes, hello. This is
Officer Becky Thatcher.

1011
01:07:33,183 --> 01:07:36,484
I have an emergency.
I'm in a hotel off Old Main.

1012
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:22,230
Something's wrong.
Will you be quiet, please?

1013
01:08:22,232 --> 01:08:24,566
We gotta-We gotta
turn out the lights.

1014
01:08:26,837 --> 01:08:29,270
Tom!

1015
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:31,506
Everything you say is a lie.
Becky.

1016
01:08:31,508 --> 01:08:34,142
Tom.
Uncuff me.

1017
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:12,780
Uncuff me, Becky.
We're in trouble.

1018
01:09:35,472 --> 01:09:37,572
Becky.

1019
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,511
Becky. Becky.
I'm gonna get us
out of here, okay?

1020
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:45,914
Just throw me the keys,
and I'll get us out of here.
Becky, stay with me.

1021
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,223
Jorge? Jorge!

1022
01:09:57,928 --> 01:10:00,895
You gotta go.

1023
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:02,564
Huh?

1024
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:31,826
Okay, Becky.

1025
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:34,295
Hang on.

1026
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:43,438
Okay. Hey. Hey.
I'm gonna die.

1027
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:44,906
No, no.
You're not gonna die.
I'm gonna die.

1028
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,248
Hold on. Wait here.
I'm gonna be right back.
I'm gonna be right back.

1029
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:56,284
Joe, we gotta get movin'.
Cops are comin'.

1030
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:16,471
Gonna move out the window.
You can do this.
You're doing great.

1031
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:55,443
Hey, Muff!
Stealing a police car
is a federal-Shit.

1032
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:57,945
Sorry, Tom.
Sorry.

1033
01:12:01,518 --> 01:12:03,685
It's okay.

1034
01:12:03,687 --> 01:12:05,887
You're gonna be okay,
all right?
Police are comin'.

1035
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:07,322
I'm sorry.
Stay. I'm scared.

1036
01:12:07,324 --> 01:12:08,690
Here! Here!

1037
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:13,528
Meow.
Meow.

1038
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:14,896
Tom!

1039
01:12:16,533 --> 01:12:17,999
You okay? Good.
Help me with this.

1040
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:20,868
Come on.

1041
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:22,570
You got it?
Yeah.

1042
01:12:22,572 --> 01:12:25,039
Let's go.

1043
01:12:26,409 --> 01:12:29,544
We got company.

1044
01:12:29,546 --> 01:12:30,712
Floor it. Floor it!

1045
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:40,822
Let's go. Let's go!

1046
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,833
Let's go.
He's coming.

1047
01:12:53,636 --> 01:12:55,636
He's coming.
Go. Go, go, go.

1048
01:13:09,619 --> 01:13:12,086
How 'bout here?
Get it.

1049
01:13:12,088 --> 01:13:13,788
Shit. Go!

1050
01:13:23,066 --> 01:13:25,566
Exit!
Where's the exit?
Here, here, here!

1051
01:13:42,685 --> 01:13:45,019
Let's go.
Harper!

1052
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:46,587
We gotta--
It's Harper.

1053
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:47,889
What?
It's Harper.

1054
01:13:47,891 --> 01:13:50,491
We gotta go! Let's go!
Go, go, go, go!

1055
01:13:50,493 --> 01:13:51,859
Go! Fuck!

1056
01:13:58,001 --> 01:14:01,736
Is he all right?
I think he's dead, Tom.

1057
01:14:01,738 --> 01:14:04,705
No, no, no, no!
Not-Not now! Come on!

1058
01:14:04,707 --> 01:14:05,940
Shit!

1059
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:08,676
Start it. Start it, Tom!
Shit.

1060
01:14:12,882 --> 01:14:15,917
Oh, no. No!

1061
01:14:15,919 --> 01:14:17,485
Get back.
Please, please!

1062
01:14:24,027 --> 01:14:25,593
Pow.

1063
01:14:33,570 --> 01:14:34,936
Oh!

1064
01:14:36,739 --> 01:14:42,009
-

1065
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:44,812
He's alive!
He's alive!

1066
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,048
He's alive!
He's alive!

1067
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:08,169
Needs a key.

1068
01:15:26,623 --> 01:15:28,789
It's gold.

1069
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:30,992
Gotta be millions.

1070
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:41,536
We can count it
later.

1071
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:50,011
Harper,
you got your cell phone?

1072
01:15:50,013 --> 01:15:52,813
We should see if people
are saying anything about us,
make sure Becky's okay.

1073
01:15:59,255 --> 01:16:02,223
Oh, there's something here
about the hotel shooting.
Ah, let's see.

1074
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:05,192
"In an absolutely
shocking case--"
So on and so forth.

1075
01:16:05,194 --> 01:16:07,061
Okay, here's Becky.

1076
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:10,798
"Officer Becky Thatcher
was wounded in the shooting,

1077
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,134
but is in stable
condition."

1078
01:16:15,271 --> 01:16:17,305
Does it say
about me saving her?

1079
01:16:17,307 --> 01:16:20,808
Here we go.
"Details are unclear
at this time,

1080
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:26,147
but Officer Thatcher implicated
fellow police officer Tom Sawyer

1081
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:30,051
as being involved
in a robbery earlier
in the morning.

1082
01:16:30,053 --> 01:16:33,988
Officer Sawyer
and his cohort,

1083
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:35,890
a career criminal,
Huckleberry Finn,

1084
01:16:35,892 --> 01:16:38,059
are believed dead

1085
01:16:38,061 --> 01:16:40,962
after being pursued by police
called to the scene."

1086
01:16:40,964 --> 01:16:43,130
Wait a minute.
Did you say "dead"?

1087
01:16:43,132 --> 01:16:46,701
Yeah, you guys are dead, man.
Says you drowned after driving
your squad car into the river.

1088
01:16:47,604 --> 01:16:49,971
My car.

1089
01:16:49,973 --> 01:16:53,741
Muff and that
Frankenstein guy stole it.

1090
01:16:53,743 --> 01:16:56,243
Shit. They must have drove it
right off that bridge.

1091
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:59,080
Is there anywhere
in there where it
covers me carrying her?

1092
01:16:59,082 --> 01:17:01,633
I carried her.

1093
01:17:01,634 --> 01:17:04,185
Kind of goes more into, like,
an opinion-oriented slant
as it goes on.

1094
01:17:04,187 --> 01:17:07,922
Like how people sworn
to protect and serve

1095
01:17:07,924 --> 01:17:09,924
being on the other side
of the law

1096
01:17:09,926 --> 01:17:12,226
are the lowest kind
of people in the world,

1097
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:13,828
and corruption--

1098
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:16,063
Honestly, I--
It's not even factual.

1099
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:18,399
This guy--
Just one guy's opinion.

1100
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:22,136
It says here, "The only man
in custody at this time

1101
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:26,007
is a Mexican immigrant
named George--"

1102
01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:27,742
Geez.
Jorge. It's Jorge.

1103
01:17:27,744 --> 01:17:30,845
Jorge. Apparently,
he's to blame for
a good bit of it too.

1104
01:17:30,847 --> 01:17:34,081
Lowest--
Lowest kind of--

1105
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:36,150
Are you insane?

1106
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:42,289
We got the treasure,
didn't we? Hmm?

1107
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:44,058
Doesn't mention that.

1108
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,260
That's the news.
That's the headline.

1109
01:17:46,262 --> 01:17:49,897
Yeah. Yeah.

1110
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:51,899
So they think we're dead.

1111
01:17:51,901 --> 01:17:54,435
Okay. Okay.

1112
01:17:57,240 --> 01:17:59,306
Blessing in disguise.

1113
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:01,442
We are dead.

1114
01:18:01,444 --> 01:18:04,812
The old Tom Sawyer,
Huck Finn and Joe Harper
are gone.

1115
01:18:06,115 --> 01:18:08,683
This is our funeral.

1116
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:10,217
And a new beginning.

1117
01:18:12,822 --> 01:18:15,389
You're dead, Joe.

1118
01:18:15,391 --> 01:18:19,226
You're the pastor at your
funeral. Eulogize yourself.
Depict your legacy.

1119
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:22,063
You know, Tom, honestly,

1120
01:18:22,065 --> 01:18:24,231
before you got
the gang together,

1121
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:28,469
I was all just, you know,
being a hermit and dying alone
in this unfeeling world.

1122
01:18:28,471 --> 01:18:31,806
But then you gave me
the opportunity to try pirate,

1123
01:18:31,808 --> 01:18:34,909
and I can't really see myself
doing anything else.

1124
01:18:34,911 --> 01:18:37,278
So, I guess I'd just say,

1125
01:18:38,948 --> 01:18:41,182
"Here lies Joe Harper,

1126
01:18:42,785 --> 01:18:45,386
in heaven, with God.

1127
01:18:46,489 --> 01:18:48,255
Great job."

1128
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:49,824
Good.

1129
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:52,727
Good.

1130
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:54,095
I'll go.

1131
01:18:57,767 --> 01:19:00,434
Well, Tom Sawyer's dead,
is he?

1132
01:19:00,436 --> 01:19:02,269
Yes.

1133
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:04,839
Here he lies in heaven
with Jesus,

1134
01:19:04,841 --> 01:19:06,507
misunderstood
in all of his glory.

1135
01:19:08,177 --> 01:19:11,145
Someday people will look back
and they'll say,

1136
01:19:11,147 --> 01:19:13,748
"Wait a second.

1137
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:16,183
He was the best.
He got the treasure.

1138
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:18,819
He loved Becky.

1139
01:19:18,821 --> 01:19:20,187
He was a hero.

1140
01:19:23,059 --> 01:19:25,226
He just didn't get
a chance to prove it."

1141
01:19:26,496 --> 01:19:28,262
The end.

1142
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:32,933
Hero?

1143
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:37,104
Heroes are good guys.

1144
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:41,208
You're not a hero.

1145
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:44,345
I'm not a hero.
You're not a hero.
We're not heroes.

1146
01:19:44,347 --> 01:19:46,981
We lie, we cheat,
we steal,

1147
01:19:46,983 --> 01:19:48,983
we hurt people.

1148
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,552
That's not
what heroes do.

1149
01:19:51,554 --> 01:19:54,155
People got killed, Tom.

1150
01:19:54,157 --> 01:19:56,357
Your partner
almost got killed.

1151
01:19:56,359 --> 01:19:58,893
Not to mention Jorge.

1152
01:19:58,895 --> 01:20:01,262
That guy, he's probably never
gonna see his family again.

1153
01:20:01,264 --> 01:20:04,165
You know
whose fault that is?
It's ours.

1154
01:20:06,135 --> 01:20:09,203
We took an innocent man,

1155
01:20:09,205 --> 01:20:11,939
and we used him up.

1156
01:20:11,941 --> 01:20:14,141
I don't have to
listen to this shit.
Don't walk away. Hey!

1157
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,343
Don't walk away.

1158
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:23,918
Huck!

1159
01:20:42,538 --> 01:20:44,171
You're right.

1160
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:46,273
You're right.

1161
01:20:46,275 --> 01:20:48,409
You're right about me.

1162
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:50,845
I care about you, Huck.

1163
01:20:50,847 --> 01:20:53,247
Since we were little,
I wanted our lives
to be magic.

1164
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:55,482
I'm trying to
make our lives magic,

1165
01:20:55,484 --> 01:20:58,152
and I just get caught up
and I get caught up
and I get stuck.

1166
01:20:58,154 --> 01:20:59,954
And I'm sorry,
and I'm--

1167
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:04,391
I'm sorry.

1168
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:13,334
Tom, I need you to know
that I do appreciate

1169
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:17,304
everything that you've
done for me.

1170
01:21:17,306 --> 01:21:20,608
When we were kids,
with my dad--
I appreciate it.

1171
01:21:23,179 --> 01:21:25,512
But I think me and you--
I think we gotta be done.

1172
01:21:29,452 --> 01:21:32,920
I think we gotta go
our separate ways.

1173
01:21:34,223 --> 01:21:36,323
What will you do?

1174
01:21:36,325 --> 01:21:38,993
Well, first I gotta figure out
what to do about Jorge.

1175
01:21:38,995 --> 01:21:41,528
Can't just leave him.

1176
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:43,264
Let me help you.

1177
01:21:46,135 --> 01:21:49,670
I'll help you do something good,
and then you don't
have to see me again.

1178
01:21:52,208 --> 01:21:54,074
You don't have to
ever see me again.

1179
01:21:58,247 --> 01:22:00,114
Okay.

1180
01:22:02,218 --> 01:22:04,251
Goddamn it.

1181
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:06,654
We're going to have to
get the whole band
back together.

1182
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:18,432
Best Auto.

1183
01:22:28,177 --> 01:22:30,678
Tom's getting the band
back together.
I'm not in the band.

1184
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:33,414
He needs us.
This is a rescue mission.

1185
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:35,416
Operation
Mexican Sunrise.

1186
01:22:45,695 --> 01:22:47,261
Aaah!

1187
01:22:56,339 --> 01:22:58,706
Hi.
I'm Detective Sid Sawyer.

1188
01:22:58,708 --> 01:23:01,475
I just have
a couple of questions
about Jorge Jiminez.

1189
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:04,078
Best Auto.

1190
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:07,414
It's for you.
Yeah.

1191
01:23:07,416 --> 01:23:10,050
This is it.
It's happening now, okay?

1192
01:23:10,052 --> 01:23:13,487
You have to get to
County Road 414 by the
oil field in half an hour.

1193
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:15,255
That's impossible.

1194
01:23:15,257 --> 01:23:19,159
I'm following your lead, Huck.
That's the story--

1195
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:22,663
You got a car?

1196
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:25,265
Yep.
I'll be there.

1197
01:23:25,267 --> 01:23:27,735
You think you'll be able
to get 'em to give him to you?

1198
01:23:27,737 --> 01:23:31,105
I'm Sid Sawyer.
I've got the keys
to the goddamn city.

1199
01:23:32,108 --> 01:23:34,375
Excuse me there.

1200
01:23:42,618 --> 01:23:45,219
What are you looking for?
My badge. I thought
that maybe I left it--

1201
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:47,621
Sid, what's going on?
Station 12 just called.

1202
01:23:47,623 --> 01:23:49,556
Said you were there
asking about Jorge Jiminez.

1203
01:24:08,310 --> 01:24:10,544
More, more. Close.

1204
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:12,246
More.

1205
01:24:12,248 --> 01:24:13,614
Perfect.

1206
01:24:27,096 --> 01:24:29,430
Here we go.

1207
01:24:36,338 --> 01:24:38,338
They're coming, they're coming,
they're coming, they're coming.

1208
01:24:45,815 --> 01:24:49,550
These short shorts cut off
the circulation to your brain,
you idiot!

1209
01:24:49,552 --> 01:24:51,718
Hey, lady.
Can't you drive a car?

1210
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,188
Did you get
your driver's license
in China?

1211
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:56,123
Shit.
They're going around.

1212
01:24:56,125 --> 01:24:57,658
Hit me.
What?

1213
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:59,860
Hit me.

1214
01:24:59,862 --> 01:25:01,662
Harper, hit me!

1215
01:25:01,664 --> 01:25:04,598
Ow! Aaah!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1216
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:08,402
You kidding me? Hey!
Step away from the woman.

1217
01:25:08,404 --> 01:25:10,637
All right.
I called the accident.
The police are on their way.

1218
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:13,207
You don't friggin' move,
asshole.

1219
01:25:13,209 --> 01:25:15,209
Not one friggin' step.

1220
01:25:21,584 --> 01:25:24,585
Hi. Don't be nervous.
I'm, uh-I'm Sid Sawyer.

1221
01:25:24,587 --> 01:25:27,688
Listen, I need to
take your prisoner.
There's a change in plan.

1222
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:29,656
The mayor's furious.
Everybody's upset.

1223
01:25:29,658 --> 01:25:31,425
But I need him in court
in 15 minutes.

1224
01:25:31,427 --> 01:25:32,793
You don't know who I am?
No.

1225
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:35,262
I'm Sid Sawyer.
I have to take him.

1226
01:25:35,264 --> 01:25:38,165

<i>Suspect impersonating</i>

1227
01:25:38,167 --> 01:25:40,801

1228
01:25:40,803 --> 01:25:43,303

1229
01:25:46,208 --> 01:25:48,208
Hey! Hey!

1230
01:25:48,210 --> 01:25:50,511
Hands on your head.
Back away from the car.
Let's go.

1231
01:25:50,513 --> 01:25:52,746
Uncuff him.
On your knees. Let's go.
On your knees.

1232
01:25:52,748 --> 01:25:54,781
Just relax.
We're having fun.
<i>Hola, Jorge.</i>

1233
01:25:55,851 --> 01:25:58,385
Been worried
about you.

1234
01:25:58,387 --> 01:26:00,654
Okay. We got you.

1235
01:26:01,357 --> 01:26:03,223
Cuff yourself.

1236
01:26:04,894 --> 01:26:06,727
Come on, Jorge.
We're getting out of here.
Let's go.

1237
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:11,231
All right.
You're doing a great job.
Come on. Go.

1238
01:26:11,233 --> 01:26:13,333
Good job.

1239
01:26:23,212 --> 01:26:25,245
I think we're okay.

1240
01:26:25,247 --> 01:26:26,880
I don't see anybody.

1241
01:26:42,231 --> 01:26:44,665
Let's go! All right.
Let's go, let's go!

1242
01:26:48,737 --> 01:26:50,020
Hey, guys, somebody
was following us.

1243
01:26:50,021 --> 01:26:51,304
We were being followed.

1244
01:26:51,307 --> 01:26:52,439
We were followed.

1245
01:26:53,442 --> 01:26:54,975
Be careful. Be careful.

1246
01:26:54,977 --> 01:26:57,344
Goddamn it.

1247
01:26:57,346 --> 01:26:59,413
All right!
We know you're in there.

1248
01:26:59,415 --> 01:27:02,749
So come out with your hands up,
and nobody gets hurt.

1249
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:05,986
All right, listen.
This is your only shot.

1250
01:27:05,988 --> 01:27:08,922
I need you to come out
with the prisoner,

1251
01:27:08,924 --> 01:27:11,592
with your hands above your head,
and no one's gonna hurt you!

1252
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:17,631
Tom, please.

1253
01:27:20,903 --> 01:27:22,869
No.

1254
01:27:22,871 --> 01:27:25,305
Barnes, you don't know
about any of this, okay?

1255
01:27:25,307 --> 01:27:27,541
All right?
We just stormed in here.

1256
01:27:29,011 --> 01:27:31,545
What are you thinking, Tom?
I'm going out there.

1257
01:27:31,547 --> 01:27:34,281
You guys wait for me.
I'm gonna pull 'em around
to the front.

1258
01:27:34,283 --> 01:27:37,017
You guys slip out the back.
What are you talking about?

1259
01:27:37,019 --> 01:27:40,854
They think there's four of us.
I'll give them four of us.

1260
01:27:40,856 --> 01:27:44,858
Element of surprise.
Element of surprise.

1261
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:48,528
Harper, grab those mop heads.
We're gonna make some hairdos.
Be creative. Go for it, okay?

1262
01:27:48,530 --> 01:27:50,931
Tom. We should
all go together.
What are you doing?

1263
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:54,701
It's not gonna work, man.
Gotta have some distraction.
You should know that by now.

1264
01:27:54,703 --> 01:27:57,738
Let me do it.
I got this one.

1265
01:27:57,740 --> 01:27:58,905
It's pretty
goddamn heroic, Tom.

1266
01:28:02,645 --> 01:28:04,911
Come on.
What are we waiting for?

1267
01:28:04,913 --> 01:28:06,780
You got any clothes
or rags that look like clothes?

1268
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:09,416
We have jackets.
That's a type of clothes.

1269
01:28:09,418 --> 01:28:12,886
Ben, grab the jackets
underneath the lift
over there.

1270
01:28:12,888 --> 01:28:14,655
Hey, Ben?

1271
01:28:16,859 --> 01:28:19,860
Give this to Becky Thatcher.
Nobody needs
to get hurt today.

1272
01:28:19,862 --> 01:28:23,063
All right. You hear me?
I know you stole my badge.

1273
01:28:23,065 --> 01:28:26,667
I forgive you.
Just come out,
and we'll talk about this.

1274
01:28:27,736 --> 01:28:30,804
Meow.
Meow.

1275
01:28:35,744 --> 01:28:37,744
Hey, Huck.

1276
01:28:37,746 --> 01:28:40,847
Don't get caught this time.
Yeah.

1277
01:28:40,849 --> 01:28:44,584
Let's go. Let's go.

1278
01:28:44,586 --> 01:28:47,521
Tom, everybody else
is coming. At that point,
there's nothing I can do.

1279
01:28:49,358 --> 01:28:51,725
Go, go.
Goddamn it, Tom!

1280
01:28:59,401 --> 01:29:01,802
Oh, cease fire!
Goddamn it, cease fire!
Go. Go.

1281
01:29:01,804 --> 01:29:05,439
Do not move!
I said stand down
and cease fire.

1282
01:29:05,441 --> 01:29:07,874
On the ground!
On the ground!

1283
01:29:07,876 --> 01:29:10,344
I said
get on the ground!
There you go!

1284
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:17,050
Tom.

1285
01:29:17,052 --> 01:29:19,920
Ambulance!
I need an ambulance!
Now!

1286
01:29:34,036 --> 01:29:36,570
<i></i>
<i>Tom took the fall</i>
<i>to get us out of there,</i>

1287
01:29:36,572 --> 01:29:38,138
<i>and we did get out.</i>

1288
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:41,108
<i>Nobody ever knew the others</i>
<i>were involved with any of it,</i>

1289
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:45,145
<i>so they went home</i>
<i>with a bit more money</i>
<i>than they started with.</i>

1290
01:29:47,449 --> 01:29:49,716
<i>Jorge and I took a long trip.</i>

1291
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:54,421
<i>I can't say it was all easy,</i>
<i>or without adventure--</i>

1292
01:29:57,559 --> 01:30:00,560
<i>But that's another story</i>
<i>for another day.</i>

1293
01:30:07,903 --> 01:30:12,606
<i>I explained Murrel's treasure</i>
<i>and how whoever found it</i>
<i>wasn't stealing it.</i>

1294
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:15,675
<i>Figured that way,</i>
<i>he'd accept a parting gift,</i>

1295
01:30:15,677 --> 01:30:19,546
<i>something to try</i>
<i>and make things right</i>
<i>after what we did.</i>

1296
01:30:22,684 --> 01:30:25,051
<i>I still wonder</i>
<i>what's happened to Tom,</i>

1297
01:30:25,053 --> 01:30:27,788
<i>where he is,</i>
<i>what he's doing.</i>

1298
01:30:27,790 --> 01:30:30,190
<i>I bet he'll make</i>
<i>a real go of it in the pen.</i>

1299
01:30:30,192 --> 01:30:33,794
<i>Be against his nature</i>
<i>to not be the most popular</i>
<i>prisoner they got.</i>

1300
01:30:33,796 --> 01:30:37,798
<i>I imagine he's probably</i>
<i>just about got his own servants</i>
<i>and everything.</i>

1301
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,700
<i>No shortage of visitors either.</i>

1302
01:30:40,702 --> 01:30:43,036
<i>Or maybe</i>
<i>it's just the same one</i>

1303
01:30:44,673 --> 01:30:48,041
<i>over and over again.</i>

1304
01:30:48,043 --> 01:30:51,578
<i>Or maybe when</i>
<i>they saw all the noble,</i>
<i>heroic stuff he'd done,</i>

1305
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:54,014
<i>they realized</i>
<i>he was like Robin Hood</i>

1306
01:30:54,016 --> 01:30:56,883
<i>and, well,</i>
<i>they gave him a pardon.</i>

1307
01:30:56,885 --> 01:31:00,187
<i>Maybe the mayor</i>
<i>even promoted him</i>
<i>to chief detective</i>

1308
01:31:00,189 --> 01:31:02,589
<i>and gave him</i>
<i>the key to the city.</i>

1309
01:31:07,996 --> 01:31:10,730
<i>Nothing would surprise me</i>
<i>with Tom.</i>

1310
01:31:13,035 --> 01:31:14,901
<i>Nothing but magic.</i>

1311
01:31:19,107 --> 01:31:21,041
<i>As for me,</i>

1312
01:31:21,043 --> 01:31:23,810
<i>I figure</i>
<i>I'll keep my eyes open</i>
<i>for something.</i>

1313
01:31:23,812 --> 01:31:26,246
<i>Maybe a shot</i>
<i>at a family someday.</i>

1314
01:31:26,248 --> 01:31:28,782
<i>Find some place</i>
<i>where I truly belong</i>

1315
01:31:28,784 --> 01:31:32,085
<i>that's good and that's right.</i>

1316
01:31:32,087 --> 01:31:35,055
<i>Until then, I-I don't know.</i>

1317
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:38,492
<i>I guess I'll just wander on.</i>

1318
01:34:07,009 --> 01:34:08,375
<i>No fun!</i>
