00:01:06,032 --> 00:01:08,467
<i>He was an outlaw.</i>

6
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:11,036
<i>And he knew his days</i>

7
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:13,472
<i>He told me that the only person</i>

8
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:16,008
<i>I could ever rely on was myself.</i>

9
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,144

<i>To survive.</i>

13
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,358
<i>To never be a victim.</i>

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,027
<i>To never cry.</i>

15
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:37,930
<i>Because those tears</i>

DEREK'S FATHER: I want
you to be happy,

24
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,161
but it doesn't hurt
to be cautious.

25
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:45,164
It's not like you are high
school sweethearts, okay?

26
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,866
You guys met at a needle
exchange, for Christ's sake.

27
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,468
DEREK: It was
Narcotics Anonymous,

28
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,703
and she is the reason
that I am still clean.

29
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:53,005
Yes, and I appreciate that,

30
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:55,007
but there are still
a lot of unknowns.

31
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,645

SANDY: My brother's
a lucky man.

33
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,425

consistent luck is skill.

00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:16,762
Well, then my brother's

please draw up the papers
and I will gladly sign them,

41
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:46,758

an exit or a strategy.

Any family, friends?

00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:59,771
That's okay, you've got us now.

45
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,306
We're your family.

PRIEST: Please be seated.

47
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:31,270
Derek and Ava have arrived

48

in their lives.

52
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,446
Take you, Ava...

53
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,015
PRIEST: to be my wife.

54
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:45,250
To be my wife.

55
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,353
( airplane engine starting )

56
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:17,249
- Oh, my God.
- She's freaking out.

57
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,953
- Freaking out.
- I'm not freaking out.

58
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,032
DEREK: My grandfather,
he bought this

59
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:36,435
back in the '40s for nothing.

60
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,170
And we used to come here
in the summer

61
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:39,237
when we were kids.

62
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:42,741
But now, my dad thinks
it's too rustic

63
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,977
and he'll only stay
at the Four Seasons.

64
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,183
What do you think?

65
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,685
AVA: It's amazing.

66
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:05,464
Right there,
that is my grandmother

67
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:07,532
on her wedding day.

68
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:11,636
And this here, that's my uncle,

69
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:13,472
and my mom

70
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:18,343
when she was two
or three years old.

71
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,217
You know, this is the first time

72
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,319
that I've actually been here
since she died.

73
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,457
She would've loved you.

74
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,928
I wish I could've met her.

75
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,865
Yeah.

76
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,537
( music playing )

77
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,863
Whoa.

78
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,437
DEREK: Why aren't I driving?

79
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,406
I should be the driver!

80
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,607
(laughs)

81
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:25,444
(Derek yells)

82
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:43,862
AVA: Whoo!

83
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,577
(reggae music playing)

84
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,813
What are you thinking?

85
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,649
I think I'm supposed
to be asking you that.

86
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,853
Typically, yeah, but...

87
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,021
Oh, my gosh!

88
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,457
Hello.
May I?

89
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,658
What's your name?

90
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,827
- Ricardo.
- Ricardo?

91
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,597
You're handsome.

92
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:20,866
It looks good on you.
It works.

93
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,133
You think so?

94
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,670
Hello. Hello.

95
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,572
Oh, oh, he wants his daddy back.

96
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:30,108
And we'll take him.

97
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,577
Come on.
Come on, little one.

98
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:40,485
You will be a great mother.

99
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,053
You think so?

100
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:43,855
Oh, I know so.

101
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,191
I didn't really have
the best influence.

102
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,027
Yeah, well, you know,
we both got

103
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:52,364
an education in how not
to raise your kids.

104
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,832
So...

105
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,268
<i>El baño.</i>

106
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,869
I have to go to the bathroom.

107
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,437
That's Spanish for...

108
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,373
You learn something new
every day.

109
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,908
All right, I'll be right back.

110
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,609
Give me a little kiss.

111
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:11,550
Do not go anywhere.

112
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:17,556
Stay right there.
Do not move.

Nice to meet you, Ava.

119
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,515
It's a beautiful,
the view, isn't it?

120
00:09:43,517 --> 00:09:45,417
It's gorgeous.

121
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,419
Where you from?

122
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,554
Connecticut.

123
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:54,192
Do you know Earl Sanders?

124
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,160
Mmm...

125
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:57,929
ah, I don't think so.

126
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,698
Well, he comes here every year.

127
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,966
He's from Connecticut.

128
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:01,833
Oh.

129
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,302
Connecticut is kind of
a large space.

( speaking in Spanish )

131
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,607
I have family in Texas.

132
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,674
- Okay.
- Yeah.

133
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,176
Okay, not that close, but okay.

134
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,047
Babe, this is Manny.
He has family in Texas.

135
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,049
Hey, man, what's up?

136
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,149
Wow, what's up?

137
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,317
- All good. All good.
- Good.

138
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,252
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

139
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:24,556
So how much longer are you guys
on the island for?

140
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,324
A few more days.

141
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:27,626
And nights.

142
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,227
Have you been to Cabarete?

143
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,464
Uh, I don't think so.

144
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,466
Oh, it's a beautiful,
beautiful place.

145
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,168
The longest zip lines
in the Caribbean.

146
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,170
- And the rain forest.
- No.

147
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,805
I'm afraid of heights.

148
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,173
- That sounds awesome.
- Oh, come on.

149
00:10:42,175 --> 00:10:44,342
My friend runs the place.

150
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:46,177
I can take you guys tomorrow.

151
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,780
And it's a very safe place.

152
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,015
Only one person died there
last year.

153
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:52,217
Only one person!

154
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,985
Relax. I'm joking.

155
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:54,919
I'm joking.

156
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,788
How about dancing?
You guys like dancing?

157
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,790
Ooh, I prefer zip-lining,
but...

158
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:01,926
I love dancing, but this one...

159
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:02,894
I can't dance.

160
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,496
Well, my friend, my friend runs

161
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,498
the hottest club
in the entire island.

162
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
We can go there.

163
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,135
I don't care.

164
00:11:10,636 --> 00:11:11,636
I'd love to.

165
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:13,271
- Well, we can do both things.
- You'd love to?

166
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:14,105
Yeah.

167
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,041
I'll tell you
what I'd love to do.

he's on his way over
with his boys,

How could they possibly know
where we're staying?

I don't know.

266
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:00,244
Maybe the taxi driver
told him or something.

Hey, hey,...

Give me your other hand.

( struggling and shouting )

389
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,189
Don't let go!

( screaming )

391
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,493
Call an ambulance.

- No, no.
- Whoa, whoa!

405
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:33,063
I'm going with my husband.

406
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,533
I'm going!

407
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,202
- I'm going with him!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

408
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:40,905
( speaking in Spanish )

409
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,374
It's something about insurance.

410
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,376
That's ridiculous!

411
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,242
I can go with my husband.

412
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,645
( speaking in Spanish )

413
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:48,913
Okay, where are you going?

415
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,385
Here.

416
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,719
It's the main hospital here.

417
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:56,987
It's good.

418
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:58,155
Go!
Go!

419
00:25:58,157 --> 00:25:58,989

421
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,928
Where's Manny?

( speaking in Spanish )

423
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:06,964
I don't know.

424
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:12,169

430
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:23,941
Excuse me.

431
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:24,943
I'm so sorry.

432
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:26,010
I am so sorry.

( speaking in Spanish )

434
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:29,046
My husband came in here,
Derek Grant,

435
00:27:29,048 --> 00:27:32,182
about 20 or 30 minutes ago
in an ambulance.

436
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:33,350
Can you check your charts?

437
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:35,219
( speaking in Spanish )

438
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:36,353
No, no, no, I'm fine.

439
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:38,222
He's in much worse condition.

440
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:39,890
( speaking in Spanish )

441
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:42,726
Please check
a Derek Grant for me, please?

442
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:49,500
( speaking in Spanish )

443
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,367
No, no, no.

444
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,603
He's blond with blue eyes.

445
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:55,072
WOMAN: American.

446
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,445

447
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:03,247

<i>DEREK: ( recorded ) You've</i>

No Derek Grant.

453

Is this Centro Medico?

454
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:33,410
Are we here?

455
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:34,845
( speaking in Spanish )

456
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:38,415
They brought him here.

457
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:41,218
The ambulance people
gave me this card.

458
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,887
My husband is here,
they dropped him off.

459
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,789
He got in an ambulance
and came here.

460
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,791
( speaking in Spanish )

461
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:50,194

Can you check your charts?

479
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:08,305
This is him.

480

Is he here?

481
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,241
Did he come in here
by ambulance?

482
00:30:11,243 --> 00:30:12,876
No. No.

483
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:17,881

This is what he looks like.

Ma'am, have you seen him?

488
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,163
Can you please help me?

<i>CINDY: Oh, hi.</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:41,538
Has Derek called you?

00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,373
<i>No.</i>
<i>Why, what's wrong?</i>

493
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,415
My husband is missing.

( speaking in Spanish )

495
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:54,785
Ah, no English.
Do you speak English?

<i>Quit moving.</i>

You think you need my help, Ava?

500
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,528
Do you need anybody's help?

501
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:40,697
You don't.

502
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:47,337
The only person you can rely on
is your own self.

503
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,306
This will heal up.

504
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,743
Survivors have scars.

505
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,845
Losers have funerals.

506
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:57,281
Scars are what you want.

507
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:58,148
They're like tattoos.

508
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,984
But with better story, huh?

509
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:04,988
Ava, you are made
with the toughest stuff around.

510
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:08,258
Don't you forget that,
all right?

511
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,533
( airplane roaring )

512
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,342
Who called for the ambulance?

513
00:32:58,344 --> 00:32:59,309
I'm not sure.

514
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,745
I think that his name is Jojo.

515
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:04,448
That's what Manny called him.

516
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,718
This Manny,
he took you to the zipline?

517
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,952
Yeah.

518
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,923
He's on the left.

519
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,893
Last name?

520
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:18,595
I don't know.

521
00:33:19,891 --> 00:33:21,131
OFFICER:
Where did you meet him?

522
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:25,102
At some restaurant on a beach.

523
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:27,971
Some restaurant on a beach?

524
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,943
Why didn't you ride
in the ambulance

525
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:34,011
with your husband?

526
00:33:34,013 --> 00:33:35,879
They wouldn't let me.

527
00:33:35,881 --> 00:33:37,547
They wouldn't let you?

528
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:39,182
I...I think
they said it was

529
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:42,285
because of some
insurance problem.

530
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:43,787
But I tried.

531
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:46,523
Did they say
where they were taking him?

532
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:50,994
I already told you this.
Centro Medico Punta Cana.

533
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,965
Punta Cana.

534
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:57,601
Punta Cana?

535
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,113
( speaking in Spanish )

536
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:19,990
<i>Gracias.</i>

537
00:34:28,866 --> 00:34:30,467
There's no record
showing of your husband

538
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:35,172
being admitted into any clinic
or hospital on the island.

539
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,441
Maybe he decided to not go.

540
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:40,077
Okay, "Not go?"

541
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,244
He was unconscious

542
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:43,814
and his leg
was completely sideways.

543
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:46,416
How the hell
is he not going to go?

544
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,854
There's no activity
on his credit card.

545
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:53,190
No outgoing calls on his phone,

546
00:34:53,192 --> 00:34:54,057
so it's either dead

547
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,927
or his battery has been taken
out so it can't be tracked.

548
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,862
Maybe the ambulance
had an accident on the way

549
00:34:58,864 --> 00:34:59,696
to the hospital.

550
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:00,931
Maybe it fell into a ditch

551
00:35:00,933 --> 00:35:03,100
and no one was able
to contact us or call.

552
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:05,635
Okay, I don't know,
but we need to be out of here,

553
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,070
out there looking for him.

554
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:07,904
DEREK'S FATHER: Maybe
we're not getting

555
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:09,673
all the information
that we need.

556
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:11,108
What does that mean?

557
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,409
Was anyone drinking?

558
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,211
You know
there wasn't any drinking.

559
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:15,812
I have a right to ask.

560
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:18,081
You already know
the answer to that.

561
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:22,419
Well there are many ambulance
companies on this island,

562
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:25,355
they're unregulated,
so it's highly competitive.

563
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:28,125
First one on the scene
gets paid.

564
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:31,061
It's a wonderful island,
but with opportunistic

565
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:32,129
and dubious parties,

566
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:33,497
everybody's trying to make

567
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:34,898
a better standing
for themselves.

568
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,502
Especially when it comes
at the expense of

569
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:40,270
wealthy Americans.

570
00:35:40,272 --> 00:35:42,506
Then again, I could be wrong.

571
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,243
If he was kidnapped,
we should know something soon.

572
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:49,346
I'd say
within the next 24 hours...

573
00:35:49,348 --> 00:35:50,714
Oh, my gosh.

574
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:52,716
So what's our next step?

575
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:00,524
MAN: We were closed yesterday.

576
00:36:00,526 --> 00:36:02,392
Actually, we're always
closed on Monday,

577
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,261
so there was no one here.

578
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:05,128
AVA: No, no, I was here.

579
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,997
I was here with my husband,
Manny and Jojo.

580
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:07,831
No, no, sorry.

581
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:10,100
We don't have any Manny
or Jojo working here.

582
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:11,301
Manny doesn't work here.

583
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:12,335
He said he was friends
with the owner.

584
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,905
Actually, I'm the owner.

585
00:36:14,907 --> 00:36:16,606
Okay, the name of the zipline

586
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:17,741
is called El Viudador.

587
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:21,545
No, no, we don't call any
of our lines El Viudador.

588
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:23,180
Are you sure
it was here, because...

589
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:24,014
Yes, it was here.

590
00:36:24,016 --> 00:36:25,515
Well, we have
a perfect safety record

591
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,684
and there are like
four other line operations

592
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,019
on the island which...

593
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:29,986
Look, it was here.

594
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:32,255
I remember the road in,
I remember the fire station,

595
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,056
I remember all of this.

596
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:35,592
There's another zipline
about 30 minutes from here

597
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:39,462
with the same kind of rope
and it looks exactly the same.

598
00:36:39,464 --> 00:36:40,464
Hey!

599
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:41,798
Wait.

600
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,168
Jojo, right?

601
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,603
You were here yesterday

602
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:48,572
when my husband
fell from the zipline, right?

603
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:49,739
<i>This is Jojo.</i>

604
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:53,276
( speaking in Spanish )

605
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,019
No.

606
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:05,055
He says he doesn't know
who you are.

607
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,823
Why are you lying?
You called the ambulance.

608
00:37:06,825 --> 00:37:08,758
( speaking in Spanish )

609
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,160
Why are you lying?

610
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:11,328
Okay, hey.

611
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,330
We were here yesterday.

612
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:14,664
Admit that you were here.

613
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,233
Admit that you were here.

614
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:19,069
Let me handle this, okay?

615
00:37:19,071 --> 00:37:21,705
Let me handle this.

616
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,909
Okay, look, maybe he thinks
he's getting in trouble.

617
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,744
Maybe he thinks
you'll get him trouble.

618
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,079
He got paid off.

619
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,013
I don't know.

620
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:31,248
Listen, you got to understand.

621
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,549
It wasn't here, okay?

622
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:33,950
You're scaring my customers.

623
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,085
( speaking in Spanish )

624
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,988
Okay, look,
let's go back to my office.

625
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:38,922
No.

626
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:39,823
Let's talk about the next step.

627
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:40,924
- Get him back!
- No, no.

628
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,525
- We got to go.
- Please go!

629
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:43,159
We need to go.

630
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:44,961
Please, please.
Please, please, please.

631
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:46,563
( speaking in Spanish )

632
00:37:47,131 --> 00:37:48,632
AVA: That was him.
That was Jojo.

633
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:50,567
Fine, yes, we'll go back
and talk about it at the office.

634
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:52,502
We should get him,
don't you think?

635
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:53,703
Everything okay?
Everything is safe.

636
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:55,805
You are going to enjoy,
enjoy yourself so far?

637
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,909
Have a seat.

638
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,952
Let's talk about Sunday night.

639
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:13,056
I got an e-mail sent to me
of a video footage

640
00:38:13,058 --> 00:38:15,292
from Club La Zona.

641
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:19,562
And apparently you have
a really violent side to you.

642
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:21,364
You on drugs?

643
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:24,668
Because you nearly
killed this guy.

644
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:28,471
I was defending myself.

645
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:31,675
Why didn't you say
anything about that?

646
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:33,143
Because I didn't see
how this had got anything

647
00:38:33,145 --> 00:38:35,879
to do with
Derek's disappearance.

648
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,249
You sure about that?

649
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:44,888
<i>Gracias.</i>

650
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,394
So you got into a tangle
with a guy named Big Biz.

651
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:53,797
You know
he makes people disappear.

652
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:56,800
Then why aren't you
interviewing him?

653
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,636
We will.

654
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:04,307
So how were you
and your husband getting along?

655
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,242
We're great.

656
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:07,077
I understand

657
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:10,313
you're the main beneficiary
of all his assets.

658
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,416
I'm his wife.

659
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:18,688
What are these?

660
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,591
Sketches.

661
00:39:21,593 --> 00:39:23,360
Why aren't
they being distributed?

662
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:26,730
Because they look like
half the men on the island

663
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:30,767
and I have to appropriately
allocate my resources.

664
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:33,803
Yeah, what exactly are you
doing with your resources?

665
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:35,705
Right now?

666
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:40,310
If you're not going to
look for my husband, I will.

667
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,314
Let's go.

668
00:39:44,316 --> 00:39:46,683
What happened?

669
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,878
( inaudible speaking )

670
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,184
Oh. Derek.

671
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:23,119
Derek, stop!

672
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:24,254
Stop!

673
00:40:24,256 --> 00:40:26,389
Derek!

674
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,960
( speaking in Spanish )

675
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:32,695
No, no.
Sorry.

676
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:34,397
Wrong car.

677
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:52,649
I'm gonna make some pasta.
Do you want some?

678
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:53,850
No, thanks.

679
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:56,553
Ava, you haven't eaten
in two days.

680
00:40:56,555 --> 00:40:58,388
Maybe just some water?

681
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,491
( door closing )

682
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:13,303
<i>Derek Grant, who disappeared</i>
<i>three days ago.</i>

683
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:15,305
<i>The couple</i>
<i>were on their honeymoon</i>

684
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:16,206
<i>on the island.</i>

685
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:18,174
<i>All previous leads</i>
<i>have been dismissed</i>

686
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,876
<i>as attempts to cash in</i>

687
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:22,111
<i>on the considerable</i>
<i>reward money.</i>

688
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,280
Did anyone call?

689
00:41:24,282 --> 00:41:28,418
You're not really expecting
any calls, are you, Ava?

690
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,326
What?

691
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:38,728
What really happened?

692
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,798
What aren't you telling us?

693
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:44,834
You think there's something
I'm not telling you?

694
00:41:44,836 --> 00:41:47,103
I think there's a great deal
you're not telling us.

695
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,271
Dad.

696
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:50,940
Maybe something went down
at that bar

697
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,909
and Derek got killed.

698
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:57,947
Or maybe somebody
wanted to kill you

699
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:00,517
and killed him instead.

700
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:03,286
Or maybe you guys just kinda...

701
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:06,890
fell off the program
and things got violent.

702
00:42:06,892 --> 00:42:09,058
I don't know.

703
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,426
But I do know

704
00:42:10,428 --> 00:42:13,062
that you are the reason
he's gone.

705
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:17,000
And I think you're trying
to tap into my finances.

706
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:22,372
I don't give a shit
about your finances, Mr. Grant.

707
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,173
I love your son.

708
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:27,977
I love him more than I loved
anything in my entire life,

709
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:29,879
and I always will.

710
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,950
Fuck you.

711
00:42:42,092 --> 00:42:44,460
( door slamming )

712
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:15,124
( speaking in Spanish )

713
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,310
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sorry.

714
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:36,045
Lady, you need to wait a minute.

715
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:37,113
She's going first.

716
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:38,881
Remember me?

717
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:40,116
Oh, shit.

718
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:41,718
Let's find some place
where we can have a talk.

719
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,719
No, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

720
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:45,455
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa!

721
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:47,190
Fuck!
Shit!

722
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:55,999
No!

723
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:57,467
No!

724
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:58,735
No!

725
00:43:58,737 --> 00:43:59,737
No, no!

726
00:43:59,738 --> 00:44:01,804
( speaking in Spanish )

727
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:03,640
Okay, Jojo, you're gonna start

728
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:05,174
telling me some information
or you're gonna die.

729
00:44:05,176 --> 00:44:06,476
Do you understand that?

730
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:07,810
Look at me!

731
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,245
What happened to my husband?

732
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:11,147
I don't know, lady!

733
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,382
You want to drop?

734
00:44:12,384 --> 00:44:13,316
No! No!

735
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,418
Did you take me
and my husband ziplining?

736
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,285
Look at me!

737
00:44:16,287 --> 00:44:17,520
Did you take me
and my husband ziplining?

738
00:44:17,522 --> 00:44:18,354
Yeah!

739
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:19,622
Why did you lie
to the cops about it?

740
00:44:19,624 --> 00:44:20,657
I don't know.

741
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:22,025
Manny, Manny told us to...

742
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:23,893
be quiet.

743
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:27,063
Manny told us that
they were very dangerous.

744
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:28,665
Who was dangerous?
Who was dangerous?

745
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,066
I don't know.
I don't know.

746
00:44:30,068 --> 00:44:31,801
Listen, you want to die,
motherfucker?

747
00:44:31,803 --> 00:44:32,602
No! No!

748
00:44:32,604 --> 00:44:34,237
Okay, look at me.

749
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:35,438
Who called the ambulance?

750
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,639
<i>Manny called.</i>

751
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:37,473
<i>Manny called the ambulance.</i>

752
00:44:37,475 --> 00:44:39,208
<i>So he knows.</i>
<i>He knows everything, please.</i>

753
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,210
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

754
00:44:40,211 --> 00:44:41,511
<i>I have his number.</i>

755
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:43,613
<i>All right.</i>
<i>All right, what's his number?</i>

756
00:44:43,615 --> 00:44:47,684
<i>It's 809-555-3210.</i>

757
00:44:47,686 --> 00:44:49,519
I tried the cell phone, it went
straight to the voicemail,

758
00:44:49,521 --> 00:44:51,521
but it's definitely
Manny's voice.

759
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:53,022
You believe me now?

760
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,225
Manny knows where Derek is.

761
00:44:56,227 --> 00:44:58,127
We need to find Manny.

762
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:59,629
Let's go.

763
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:03,266
( speaking in Spanish )

764
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:04,534
- Turn around.
- What?

765
00:45:04,536 --> 00:45:06,536
Turn around.

766
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,705
Let's go find my husband!

767
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,907
Hey!

768
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:13,109
[grunting]

769
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,791
( speaking in Spanish )

770
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:35,331
Maybe you can torture people
in America

771
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:37,567
to get a confession out of them,

772
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:38,835
but not here.

773
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:40,303
And I'm gonna let you leave here

774
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:42,438
with some dignity intact.

775
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,542
Officer Santos is gonna
take you back to Puerto Rico.

776
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:49,679
You are no longer welcome
on this island.

777
00:45:49,681 --> 00:45:51,180
Do you understand that?

778
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:54,383
( horn blowing )

779
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:05,194
Excuse me, sir,
I have to go to the bathroom.

780
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:07,830
( speaking in Spanish )

781
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,989
Are you gonna
take my handcuffs off?

782
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:34,357
Get in.

783
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:42,632
Well, you're gonna
have to come in here

784
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:44,267
and help me.

785
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,741
( urinating )

786
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,918
Can you get me some tissue?

787
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,379
( speaking in Spanish )

788
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,112
So my boyfriend thought

789
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,480
it would be funny
to throw me in the pool.

790
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:13,416
( speaking in Spanish )

791
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:16,886
I'm going to kill him.

792
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:49,585
( party music playing )

793
00:49:49,587 --> 00:49:51,988
( speaking in Spanish )

794
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,422
Are you alone?

795
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:54,590
<i>Si.</i>

796
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:56,525
( speaking in Spanish )

797
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:58,627
Let's hope so.

798
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:06,002
[party music playing]

799
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:48,377
( speaking in Spanish )

800
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:16,539
Hello, Manny.

801
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:19,141
People don't just disappear.

802
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:21,477
No!
I'm here illegally.

803
00:51:21,479 --> 00:51:24,413
I can't talk to the cops
or they'll send me back!

804
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,382
You're gonna wish
you were back home.

805
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:26,982
I swear!

806
00:51:26,984 --> 00:51:29,552
I don't know anything
about your husband!

807
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:38,027
- Where's Derek?
- I don't know!

808
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:43,799
You called the ambulance.

809
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:44,633
I did!

810
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:46,469
But when I called,
they said that someone else

811
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:47,937
had already called in.

812
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:48,939
Who?

813
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,639
I don't know!

814
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:54,176
( banging on door )

815
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:58,013
( speaking in Spanish )

816
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,949
Who are these guys?

817
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:01,283
Who are your buddies?

818
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,486
What is that?
What is that?

819
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:05,721
It's a tattoo that one
of the paramedics had.

820
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:06,889
This guy has that tattoo.

821
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:08,958
That's their fucking
neighborhood!

822
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,092
That's T.S.

823
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:12,661
( speaking in Spanish )

824
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:13,963
They own that shit.

825
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:15,364
Everybody knows that.

826
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:19,502
Police, the politicians,
even the<i> putas</i> know that.

827
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:27,243
If you're fucking with me,
things are gonna get nasty.

828
00:52:27,245 --> 00:52:29,111
Nastier than this shit?

829
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:30,212
( knocking on door )

830
00:52:30,214 --> 00:52:32,715
( speaking in Spanish )

831
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:36,152
You're not safe here.

832
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:37,453
Tell me something I don't know.

833
00:52:37,455 --> 00:52:41,891
If you want me
to help you find Derek,

834
00:52:41,893 --> 00:52:44,059
you have to deal
with... ( indistinct ).

835
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:47,096
( banging on door )

( speaking in Spanish )

838
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,150
Let's go over here.

839
00:53:41,152 --> 00:53:42,585
This is my room.

840
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:44,820
( speaking in Spanish )

841
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:54,797
So you live with your mom.

842
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:57,633
I came over first...

843
00:53:57,635 --> 00:54:01,537
and made enough money
to bring her over.

844
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:03,780
There's not enough work in
the island where we come from,

845
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:05,574
except for fucking drugs.

846
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:11,547
Tomorrow you're gonna
take me to ( indistinct ).

847
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:14,416
We're gonna work together
to find this guy.

848
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:18,020
They say that
if a person isn't found

849
00:54:18,022 --> 00:54:19,688
within the first few days,
the likelihood...

850
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,190
Don't.
Please don't.

851
00:54:21,192 --> 00:54:22,591
Just don't.

852
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,860
I'm sorry.

853
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,265
Derek is alive and I'm gonna do

854
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:30,499
whatever it takes
to get him back.

855
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:33,035
You should probably
understand that.

856
00:54:33,037 --> 00:54:34,103
I do.

857
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:37,273
So relax.

858
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:38,674
You should get some rest.

859
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:41,610
Get in there.

860
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,223
In this place, there's no law,

861
00:54:54,225 --> 00:54:57,192
there's no mommy,
there's no daddy, okay?

862
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:01,730
Everything you see
is not really what it is.

863
00:55:01,732 --> 00:55:04,266
Everybody here is trained

864
00:55:04,268 --> 00:55:06,268
to be unwelcoming.

865
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,504
( speaking in Spanish )

866
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:09,305
Yeah.

00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:14,476
No.

871
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,478
Yeah, everybody here
is off the grid.

872
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,213
They're either not from here

873
00:55:18,215 --> 00:55:20,749
or they've been let go
by everyone.

874
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:22,217
Stay, okay?

875
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:25,220

Hold on, hold on.

878
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:47,643
- What?
- That's it, that's it.

879
00:55:47,645 --> 00:55:50,045
- What's what?
- Stop, go back, go back!

880
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:51,113
All right.

881
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:53,282
- What is it?
- Just stop.

882
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,852
That's it, that's it.

883
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,121
- What?
- That's his tattoo.

884
00:55:59,123 --> 00:56:00,589
The paramedic,
the one with gold teeth,

885
00:56:00,591 --> 00:56:01,990
that is his tattoo.
Look.

886
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:04,259
What's this?

887
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:08,063
That's when they do
the cock fights and stuff.

888
00:56:08,065 --> 00:56:09,365
- I know where it is. Let's go.
- Okay.

889
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:10,766
- All right.
- Let's get out.

890
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:14,937
No, no, no.

891
00:56:14,939 --> 00:56:16,038
Don't get out, okay?

892
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,439
Just give me the flyer.

893
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,443
Stay here.

I can't hear you!
What?

900
00:57:56,272 --> 00:57:58,073
What the fuck, man!

took my husband

in your ambulance.

908
01:00:18,549 --> 01:00:19,781
Where did you take him?

909
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:21,550
I don't drive an ambulance.

910

( screams )

911
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,721
My father was not
a well-educated man,

912
01:00:25,723 --> 01:00:28,090
but he did know
a little something

913
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:29,391
about the human anatomy.

914
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:33,161
He showed me
where all the vital organs are.

915
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:35,297
You have the wrong guy!

916
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:38,233
See, the tummy is squishy.

917
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:41,603
You've got the colon,
the small intestine.

918
01:00:41,605 --> 01:00:45,307
It's the squishy stuff
that's hard to puncture.

919
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,075
( speaking in Spanish )

920
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:48,310
Where is my husband?

921
01:00:48,312 --> 01:00:50,746
I told you,
I don't know anything!

922
01:00:50,748 --> 01:00:53,649
Maybe I should just go
for your spleen.

923
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:58,053
But you can live without
your spleen, can't you?

924
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:00,555
Where's my husband?

925
01:01:00,557 --> 01:01:02,491
I don't know.

926
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:04,126
Or I could go for your liver.

927
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:07,029
Puncturing it would probably
make you bleed out

928
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:08,363
in five or six minutes.

929
01:01:08,365 --> 01:01:11,099
Okay, okay, okay!
Okay.

930
01:01:11,101 --> 01:01:14,970
This girl was texting me.

931
01:01:14,972 --> 01:01:18,974
I got dropped off!

932
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:21,043
I don't know
what happened after that,

933
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:22,110
I swear!

934
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:26,615
Next day, Omar comes over
with a bunch of money.

935
01:01:26,617 --> 01:01:30,686
He told me to quit my job,
not to say anything.

936
01:01:30,688 --> 01:01:32,521
So I did it, okay?

937
01:01:32,523 --> 01:01:34,289
I did!

938
01:01:34,291 --> 01:01:36,792
You're looking for Omar, not me!

939
01:01:36,794 --> 01:01:39,227
It's him
you're looking for, not me!

940
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:40,896
( grunting )

941
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:49,871
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

942
01:01:49,873 --> 01:01:51,139
I'm texting your brother.

943
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:53,141
He'll fucking kill you!

944
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:54,710
You tried.

945
01:01:54,712 --> 01:01:56,778
How'd that work out for you?

946
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:07,155
( radio music playing )

947
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:25,707
( door opens )

948
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,215
( speaking in Spanish )

949
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,693
Timo?

950
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:52,267
( fighting )

951
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,136
AVA: Remember me?

952
01:02:54,138 --> 01:02:56,104
I bet you do.

953
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:59,207
Now you're gonna tell me
where my husband is.

954
01:02:59,209 --> 01:03:01,276
Where is my husband?

955
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:03,311
( pocketknife opens )

956
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:17,259
( gunshot )

957
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:29,204
( siren blaring )

958
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:35,710
You break into someone's house
and assault them?

959
01:03:35,712 --> 01:03:38,246
They have every right
to use deadly force

960
01:03:38,248 --> 01:03:38,947
to defend themselves.

961
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:41,550
Timo admitted to taking
my husband in an ambulance.

962
01:03:41,552 --> 01:03:42,552
He's in on it.

963
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:45,020
I don't know.
He said he got paid.

964
01:03:45,022 --> 01:03:46,087
Let her out.

965
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:47,289
Let's go.

966
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,226
I'll tell you what I think.

967
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,862
I think you paid those two guys,

968
01:03:53,864 --> 01:03:57,933
who are really no choir boys,
to kill your husband.

969
01:03:57,935 --> 01:03:59,034
And then you silenced them,

970
01:03:59,036 --> 01:04:00,969
so that they wouldn't
implicate you.

971
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:03,505
You know, from the beginning,

972
01:04:03,507 --> 01:04:05,006
the only violence and wrongdoing

973
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:09,244
that I've witnessed has been
perpetrated by you and only you.

974
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:13,582
You are being held for
the murder of Omar Tavarez

975
01:04:13,584 --> 01:04:16,151
and the attempted murder
of Timo Tavarez.

976
01:04:16,153 --> 01:04:20,422
And you are now officially
the prime suspect

977
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:21,690
in the disappearance

978
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:23,792
and probable murder
of your husband.

979
01:04:23,794 --> 01:04:24,794
So you know what?

980
01:04:24,795 --> 01:04:28,196
A bath, a shower, and a lawyer.

981
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:30,198
Whatever order you want,
that's what you need.

982
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,702
Look, fine, take me,
but my husband's alive.

983
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:34,736
You need to find him.

984
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:35,871
He's still out there.
He's alive.

985
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:37,939
Taking you to headquarters
for further interrogation.

986
01:04:37,941 --> 01:04:39,207
Please!
Please look at me!

987
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,976
My husband's alive!

988
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:43,378
Yeah, well,
we're gonna transfer you

989
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,649
over to headquarters
for the interrogation.

990
01:04:47,651 --> 01:04:50,285
Derek's father and sister
have requested

991
01:04:50,287 --> 01:04:53,955
that you be charged
with a capital offense.

992
01:04:53,957 --> 01:04:55,891
Please find my husband for me.

993
01:04:55,893 --> 01:04:58,326
Please, do your job.

994
01:04:58,328 --> 01:05:01,463
Good luck.

995
01:05:04,166 --> 01:05:05,867
My husband is alive.

996
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:29,991
( speaking in Spanish )

997
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:35,630
We're not going
to police headquarters, are we?

998
01:05:35,632 --> 01:05:38,333
( speaking in Spanish )

999
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:50,245
( speaking in Spanish )

1000
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:05,593
( speaking in Spanish )

1001
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,098
( digging )

1002
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:23,044
( bone breaking )

1003
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,292
( digging continues )

1004
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:42,030
( speaking in Spanish )

1005
01:06:46,802 --> 01:06:48,403
Let's go.

1006
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:52,073
( door banging )

1007
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,012
( grunting )

1008
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:17,098
( phone vibrating )

1009
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:29,878
( speaking in Spanish )

1010
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,381
<i>AVA: No.</i>
<i>You know what that means.</i>

1011
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:36,518
Ava.

1012
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,186
<i>Why don't you come</i>
<i>to your daughter's room</i>

1013
01:07:38,188 --> 01:07:40,121
<i>and we can have a little talk.</i>

1014
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:21,663
( lamp clicks )

1015
01:08:22,164 --> 01:08:23,698
GARZA (whispering ):
Please, don't.

1016
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:24,532
AVA: Shh!

1017
01:08:24,534 --> 01:08:26,334
Keep your voice down.

1018
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:28,870
You don't want to
wake your daughter.

1019
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:30,672
Gun.

1020
01:08:30,674 --> 01:08:32,073
Sit.

1021
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:38,279
- My family.
- Your family?

1022
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:40,215
Let's talk about your family.

1023
01:08:40,217 --> 01:08:41,216
What would you be willing to do?

1024
01:08:41,218 --> 01:08:44,419
Where would you be
willing to go?

1025
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:48,490
Look, it was me.

1026
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:50,191
I did this.

1027
01:08:50,193 --> 01:08:52,494
You don't understand, I owe him.

1028
01:08:52,496 --> 01:08:53,496
Who?

1029
01:08:53,497 --> 01:08:56,131
Avilar.

1030
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,034
The doctor
from Villa Jaragual Clinic.

1031
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:02,237
Look, he did something
for me, okay?

1032
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:04,205
She... She was too young,

1033
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:06,074
and he just made sure

1034
01:09:06,076 --> 01:09:09,644
the family didn't find out
about her pregnancy.

1035
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:10,712
I owe him everything.

1036
01:09:10,714 --> 01:09:12,881
If my wife and kids...

1037
01:09:12,883 --> 01:09:15,049
Yeah, you're a real family man.

1038
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:16,084
I can see that.

1039
01:09:16,086 --> 01:09:18,486
Where's my husband?

1040
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:24,259
The doctor, he made a mistake.

1041
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:26,628
He tried to set his bone...

1042
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:32,100
and he punctured
his femoral artery.

1043
01:09:32,102 --> 01:09:34,102
He tried to save him.

1044
01:09:34,104 --> 01:09:36,304
Look, he asked me...

1045
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:39,240
he begged me to cover it up.

1046
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,277
Otherwise,
the American would make sure

1047
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:44,245
his clinic was finished.

1048
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:47,749
He wanted to make it seem
like he never made it

1049
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:50,084
to the clinic at all.

1050
01:09:50,086 --> 01:09:51,953
You've been lying to me
this whole time.

1051
01:09:51,955 --> 01:09:54,255
You knew my husband was dead?

1052
01:09:54,257 --> 01:09:56,491
And you tried to have me killed?

1053
01:09:56,493 --> 01:09:58,626
You need to go.

1054
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:00,562
Please don't do this.

1055
01:10:00,564 --> 01:10:04,132
Not in front of my family
and my daughter, please.

1056
01:10:04,134 --> 01:10:06,301
I understand, okay?

1057
01:10:06,303 --> 01:10:08,203
I don't deserve to live.

1058
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:09,205
I'm a bad man.

1059
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:12,106
Please, not here.

1060
01:10:12,108 --> 01:10:14,342
You have two options.

1061
01:10:14,344 --> 01:10:15,543
One...

1062
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:18,046
two.

1063
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:21,683
One of these is quiet.

1064
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:25,987
We can go to the bathroom.

1065
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:28,056
I'll make sure
your wife finds you,

1066
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:29,691
not your kid.

1067
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:08,396
( door opens )

1068
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:17,605
( door closes )

1069
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,407
( banging on door )

1070
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:25,213
( crying )

1071
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,654
MANNY: What the hell
happened to you?

1072
01:11:32,656 --> 01:11:35,123
He's gone.

1073
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:36,758
He's gone.

1074
01:11:56,612 --> 01:12:00,248
Derek showed up,
when he could've...

1075
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,152
He saved me.

1076
01:12:04,154 --> 01:12:06,254
He changed me.

1077
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:12,260
You changed you.

1078
01:12:12,262 --> 01:12:14,462
He just gave you a reason.

1079
01:12:14,464 --> 01:12:16,898
I have to finish this.

1080
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:21,469
"When all the bastards
are gone and dead,

1081
01:12:21,471 --> 01:12:24,372
only then rest your head."

1082
01:12:24,374 --> 01:12:25,340
( speaking in Spanish )

1083
01:12:25,342 --> 01:12:27,942
That's cheery.

1084
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,143
Where is that from?

1085
01:12:29,145 --> 01:12:33,014
I heard that every night
before I went to sleep.

1086
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:36,417
That's a pretty shitty lullaby.

1087
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:43,691
I can help you.

1088
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:49,430
No, you can't.

1089
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:55,670
I have to do this on my own.

1090
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:59,841
What the hell
happened to your hand?

1091
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:03,010
Shit.

1092
01:13:03,012 --> 01:13:05,213
You should go see a doctor.

1093
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:06,314
I plan to.

1094
01:13:06,316 --> 01:13:08,716
First thing tomorrow.

1095
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:57,698
( grunting )

1096
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:02,270
Can you just please check
a Derek Grant for me?

1097
01:14:02,272 --> 01:14:03,371
Please.

1098
01:14:03,373 --> 01:14:04,906
No Derek Grant.

1099
01:14:14,416 --> 01:14:17,819
( speaking in Spanish )

1100
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,363
( speaking in Spanish )

1101
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:50,418
You have a limited amount
of oxygen,

1102
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:52,787
so I want you
to listen to me carefully.

1103
01:14:52,789 --> 01:14:54,655
I want to know
what happened to my husband.

1104
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:56,724
He is the American
with the broken leg.

1105
01:14:56,726 --> 01:14:58,593
I want to know how he died

1106
01:14:58,595 --> 01:15:00,127
and what happened to his body.

1107
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:03,631
Are you ready to tell me
everything I need to know?

1108
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:06,000
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1109
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,201
I have no idea...

1110
01:15:07,203 --> 01:15:09,437
Really?

1111
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,505
Derek Grant!

1112
01:15:10,507 --> 01:15:13,140
Garza, the little girl,
the pregnancy!

1113
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:17,578
Please, I just need to know.

1114
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:20,882
( speaking in foreign language )

1115
01:15:20,884 --> 01:15:22,416
Fine. Fine.

1116
01:15:28,724 --> 01:15:31,626
( speaking in foreign language )

1117
01:15:31,628 --> 01:15:33,461
You don't understand.
You don't know what...

1118
01:15:33,463 --> 01:15:35,863
Really, because I think
it's pretty fucking simple!

1119
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:37,832
( gasping )

1120
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,011
( door buzzing )

1121
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:54,549
Wait.

1122
01:15:55,784 --> 01:15:56,851
Wait!

1123
01:15:56,853 --> 01:15:58,152
I think you're gonna find out

1124
01:15:58,154 --> 01:16:00,888
everything
you ever wished to know.

1125
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:01,923
Take a look.

1126
01:16:01,925 --> 01:16:03,624
Take a look.

1127
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:13,634
You...

1128
01:16:13,636 --> 01:16:16,404
You told Garza he's dead.

1129
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:17,471
No, wait.

1130
01:16:17,473 --> 01:16:19,073
I can help you.

1131
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:20,508
You pull that trigger,

1132
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:23,544
then your husband
is gonna be dead for sure.

1133
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:35,656
( elevator door opens )

1134
01:16:44,933 --> 01:16:47,234
( speaking in Spanish )

1135
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,387
Christie.

1136
01:17:06,389 --> 01:17:08,956
Christie.

1137
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:13,094
Silvio Lugo.

1138
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:17,331
What happened to your hand?

1139
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:19,934
Got it caught in a door.

1140
01:17:19,936 --> 01:17:20,968
Stupid door.

1141
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,536
- Right?
- Yeah.

1142
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:29,210
I'm gonna need to search you.

1143
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:40,121
( speaking in Spanish )

1144
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:52,099
( speaking in Spanish )

1145
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:16,791
Call me.

1146
01:18:16,793 --> 01:18:19,260
( speaking in Spanish )

1147
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:29,070
Hey, S, how you feeling, my man?

1148
01:18:29,072 --> 01:18:30,304
Huh?

1149
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:35,009
Ready to give some
of that miracle milk?

1150
01:18:36,678 --> 01:18:39,180
You are my golden ticket.

1151
01:18:41,783 --> 01:18:45,119
( speaking in Spanish )

1152
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:58,165
Doc, what are you waiting for?

1153
01:18:58,167 --> 01:18:59,567
Some anesthesia.

1154
01:18:59,569 --> 01:19:02,002
No, no, no.
My man can handle it.

1155
01:19:02,004 --> 01:19:03,104
Can't you, Papi?

1156
01:19:03,106 --> 01:19:04,472
Yeah, fuck that.

1157
01:19:04,474 --> 01:19:06,107
Go.

1158
01:19:06,109 --> 01:19:06,907
That's it.

1159
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:09,110
Get him all nice and clean.

1160
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:15,716
( speaking in Spanish )

1161
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:21,355
But you're so cute,
I don't care.

1162
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:24,291
You can do anything you like.

1163
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:27,161
( speaking in Spanish )

1164
01:19:27,996 --> 01:19:30,097
That's it.

1165
01:19:30,665 --> 01:19:33,367
Show me, Doc.

1166
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:35,669
( groans )

1167
01:19:43,578 --> 01:19:46,147
It's okay, Papi.

1168
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:48,149
You can handle it.

1169
01:19:48,151 --> 01:19:50,151
There you go.

1170
01:19:50,153 --> 01:19:52,620
( groaning )

1171
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:54,355
There you go.

1172
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,859
It's okay.

1173
01:20:00,662 --> 01:20:02,096
That's it.

1174
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,635
You're doing a good job, bro.

1175
01:20:07,637 --> 01:20:10,871
Doing a great job.

1176
01:20:14,109 --> 01:20:16,177
That's it, Papa.

1177
01:20:16,179 --> 01:20:17,411
That's it.

1178
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:21,315
Good boy.

1179
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:23,384
That's a good boy.

1180
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:26,187
Come on, Doc, give me that.

1181
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:40,401
Yeah...

1182
01:20:40,403 --> 01:20:42,403
that's what I like to see.

1183
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:46,240
A real fountain of life.

1184
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:50,911
Thank you, Papi.

1185
01:20:52,647 --> 01:20:55,249
( chuckles )

1186
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:01,422
( speaking in Spanish )

1187
01:21:06,428 --> 01:21:08,295
( speaking in Spanish )

1188
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:17,204
You trying to put me to sleep?

1189
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,374
Doc, where'd you find this girl?

1190
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,710
( speaking in foreign language )

1191
01:21:22,712 --> 01:21:24,511
Nobody fucking move!

1192
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,148
Put your fucking hands up!

1193
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:28,949
Hey!
Hey!

1194
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:31,585
( speaking in Spanish )

1195
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:32,987
Give me the gun.

1196
01:21:32,989 --> 01:21:34,455
Down.

1197
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:37,358
Get the fuck down!

1198
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:43,330
Who the fuck are you?

1199
01:21:43,332 --> 01:21:45,633
I'm his wife.

1200
01:21:45,635 --> 01:21:47,301
Oh.

1201
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:49,904
So you're the girl my man here

1202
01:21:49,906 --> 01:21:52,206
has been speaking so highly of.

1203
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:55,910
Who, who!
Was that necessary?

1204
01:21:55,912 --> 01:21:57,745
All this violence!

1205
01:21:57,747 --> 01:22:00,981
Seriously, we're all helping
each other here.

1206
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:05,152
Your husband has been
a real life saver, you know?

1207
01:22:05,154 --> 01:22:08,055
I have this rare type of cancer.

1208
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:09,757
( speaking in Spanish )

1209
01:22:09,759 --> 01:22:10,759
Multiple myeloma.

1210
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,159
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

1211
01:22:12,161 --> 01:22:13,427
And the only effective treatment

1212
01:22:13,429 --> 01:22:16,697
are these stem cell transfusions
from bone marrow.

1213
01:22:16,699 --> 01:22:19,300
You know, I pay the doctor
here good money

1214
01:22:19,302 --> 01:22:22,002
But it ain't easy, is it, Doc?

1215
01:22:22,004 --> 01:22:23,370
( speaking in Spanish )

1216
01:22:23,372 --> 01:22:24,372
Stay back!

1217
01:22:24,373 --> 01:22:26,507
( speaking in Spanish )

1218
01:22:26,509 --> 01:22:29,843
Hey, listen, you need
to learn more Spanish, babe.

1219
01:22:29,845 --> 01:22:32,012
Listen,
I can call some of my men,

1220
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:33,414
the ones you haven't
shot already,

1221
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:36,016
and they can help you
find your way out.

1222
01:22:36,018 --> 01:22:38,085
I can find my own way out.

1223
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:40,020
Are you sure?
It's a big building.

1224
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:42,856
You know what?

1225
01:22:42,858 --> 01:22:45,526
Thank you, Christie,
for sharing your husband.

1226
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:54,969
( speaking in Spanish )

1227
01:23:01,776 --> 01:23:04,378
( gunshots )

1228
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:04,071
( elevator door closing )

1229
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:19,653
We're gonna
get you out of here, okay?

1230
01:24:21,856 --> 01:24:24,224
So...

1231
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:26,393
what you been up to, huh?

1232
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:34,668
I'm gonna need you
to help me, okay?

1233
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:35,670
Yeah.

1234
01:24:35,671 --> 01:24:37,704
Okay.

1235
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:43,977
( elevator door opening )

1236
01:25:30,058 --> 01:25:31,058
( door opening )

1237
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:36,063
( speaking in Spanish )

1238
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:41,635
( gun shooting )

1239
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:44,771
( container exploding )

1240
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:49,209
( screaming )

1241
01:25:54,549 --> 01:25:57,985
( speaking in Spanish )

1242
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:03,790
You guys suck, motherfuckers.

1243
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:07,094
Easy, easy.

1244
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:09,796
Keep this on him.

1245
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:13,300
( tires screeching )

1246
01:26:20,441 --> 01:26:22,910
You know, I can pay you
for what you've done.

1247
01:26:22,912 --> 01:26:25,078
I should've offered you
money up front,

1248
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,046
but people are so selfish

1249
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,948
when it comes to donating
their body parts.

1250
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:29,816
I just couldn't take the risk

1251
01:26:29,818 --> 01:26:33,420
when it's so hard to find
a bone marrow of a donor

1252
01:26:33,422 --> 01:26:35,355
who's tissue is a perfect match.

1253
01:26:35,357 --> 01:26:37,291
You know,
with your husband's bone marrow

1254
01:26:37,293 --> 01:26:39,393
and my strict diet...

1255
01:26:39,395 --> 01:26:41,128
Ah!

1256
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:45,832
Bro, your girl hits hard.

1257
01:26:46,907 --> 01:26:48,268
Where you gonna run,
little rabbit?

1258
01:26:48,270 --> 01:26:51,905
You realize you're on an island.

1259
01:26:51,907 --> 01:26:53,440
My island!

1260
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:57,344
Things are gonna end up
badly for you guys, seriously.

1261
01:26:57,346 --> 01:26:58,812
Tell me, Derek, do you even know

1262
01:26:58,814 --> 01:27:00,747
how to use one of those things

1263
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:04,051
( screaming )

1264
01:27:04,053 --> 01:27:05,285
Yeah, I do.

1265
01:27:05,287 --> 01:27:06,320
( speaking in Spanish )

1266
01:27:06,322 --> 01:27:08,622
You two motherfuckers are crazy.

1267
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,296
( speaking in Spanish )

1268
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:21,535
Do you see anyone?

1269
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:25,672
Take the left!

1270
01:27:25,674 --> 01:27:27,140
( horn honking )

1271
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,948
Right there in the yellow dress.
Go left. Right there.

1272
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:36,250
Got it.

1273
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:45,959
All right.
Where's this next turn?

1274
01:27:45,961 --> 01:27:47,861
Right there,
right there, right there.

1275
01:27:47,863 --> 01:27:49,896
Pink shirt, next right.

1276
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:02,442
( crashing )
