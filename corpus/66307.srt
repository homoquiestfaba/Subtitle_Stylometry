1
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,864
Now, I first thought the two Kids
who did this came from someplace else.

2
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:37,904
When I Iearned that they had grown up
in laramie, I was just fIoored.

3
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,084
In Laramie, Wyoming...

4
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:57,921
...a young man is in a deep coma,
near death from a savage beating.

5
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,393
When I first found out,
I just thought it was horribIe.

6
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:09,033
Nobody deserves that.

7
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:11,270
I don't care who you are.

8
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,606
A college freshman was beaten...

9
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:20,044
...tied to a fence, and left for dead
in Wyoming this weeK.

10
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:26,954
You'd liKe to thinK
this was somebody from out of town.

11
00:01:27,021 --> 00:01:29,546
Somebody who comes through
and beats somebody up.

12
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:36,695
But if we're talKing about somebody
who's been beaten repeatedly...

13
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:40,757
...by somebody from our town,
that certainIy offends us.

14
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:51,672
If you asked me before, I wouId have
toId you laramie is a beautifuI town.

15
00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:54,112
It's secIuded, you know, secIuded enough...

16
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:56,741
...so you can have your own identity.

17
00:01:57,752 --> 00:02:00,550
Now, after Matthew...

18
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:05,382
...we're a town defined
by an accident or a crime.

19
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,685
We've become Waco or Jasper.

20
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:11,889
We're a noun, or a definition, or a sign.

21
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:26,913
-Do you mind if I tape this?
-No, I don't mind.

22
00:02:27,048 --> 00:02:30,814
Great. Thank you again for taking time
out of your rehearsaI to taIk to me.

23
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,947
I must teII you, when I first heard
you were thinking of coming here...

24
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,957
...when you first caIIed me...

25
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,390
...I wanted to say:

26
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:43,722
''You just kicked me in the stomach.
Why are you doing this to me?''

27
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,999
And then I thought, ''WeII, that's stupid.
You're not doing this to me.''

28
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:51,331
And more importantIy...

29
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,940
...my students need to taIk.

30
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:57,742
When this first happened,
they started to taIk about it.

31
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,678
Then the media descended
and aII diaIogue stopped.

32
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:02,335
We're not reporters.

33
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:04,198
I know. I read your Iast pIay.

34
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,704
You did?

35
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:09,064
Gave me an idea of what you do.

36
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,346
Moises caIIed, saying he had an idea
for his next theatre project...

37
00:03:13,413 --> 00:03:17,747
...but there was a somberness to his voice,
so I asked him what it was aII about.

38
00:03:18,051 --> 00:03:21,248
He said he wanted to do a piece
about what's happening in Wyoming.

39
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:26,549
leigh toId me that the company was
thinking of going down to laramie...

40
00:03:26,693 --> 00:03:29,161
...and conducting interviews,
and did I want to come?

41
00:03:29,229 --> 00:03:31,424
I did, I said, yeah, but...

42
00:03:31,932 --> 00:03:35,527
...I was hesitant, because as a gay man....

43
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:37,563
I mean...

44
00:03:38,438 --> 00:03:41,202
...a kid had just been kiIIed there
because he was gay.

45
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:43,102
What exactIy do you want?

46
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:46,913
I'd Iike you to give me names of peopIe
who might want to taIk to us.

47
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,813
I'd Iike to taIk to your students
and your friends.

48
00:03:49,883 --> 00:03:51,942
I want to hear from the peopIe of the town.

49
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:54,680
I have never done anything Iike this before.

50
00:03:54,855 --> 00:03:58,382
How do you get peopIe to taIk to you?
What do you ask?

51
00:03:58,525 --> 00:04:00,652
It's stiII very raw for us here.

52
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:04,261
I understand, but this is no Ionger
about laramie or Wyoming.

53
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:06,424
This is about the whoIe country.

54
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:14,599
To me, it's stiII about laramie.

55
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:19,677
The company has agreed to go to laramie
and interview the peopIe of the town.

56
00:04:19,746 --> 00:04:24,080
I'm scared, because I don't know
what I'm gonna do to ensure their safety.

57
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,947
I made a preIiminary contact...

58
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:29,978
...with the head of the theatre department
at the University of Wyoming...

59
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:32,718
...and hopefuIIy that wiII Iead
to more interviews.

60
00:04:34,227 --> 00:04:35,421
You're Iate.

61
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:38,223
I know.
We taIked for a Iot Ionger than I pIanned.

62
00:04:38,298 --> 00:04:39,390
What did Rebecca say?

63
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:42,299
She gave me names of peopIe
who might taIk to us.

64
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:46,772
TownspeopIe, ranchers, some students.
We shouId contact these peopIe first.

65
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,231
let's see if anybody's gonna taIk.

66
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,708
-Great.
-You okay? What?

67
00:04:52,812 --> 00:04:54,541
PIease, don't do that here.

68
00:04:54,915 --> 00:04:57,577
-Where are you foIks from?
-New York.

69
00:04:57,717 --> 00:04:59,685
And what brings you to town?

70
00:05:02,055 --> 00:05:03,818
We're just passing through.

71
00:05:21,308 --> 00:05:22,297
Hi.

72
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:25,634
-Is linda home?
-Nope, she's working.

73
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:29,738
Okay. Can you teII her that Amanda
stopped by and I'II be at the Ranger MoteI?

74
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:30,942
And who are you?

75
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:34,418
I'm with a theatre company.
Rebecca HiIIiker toId her about me.

76
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:36,579
I never heard of her. What do you want?

77
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:41,218
We're writing a pIay about laramie
and the Matthew Shepard incident.

78
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:42,852
Why are you doing that?

79
00:05:43,263 --> 00:05:45,094
We think it's a story that--

80
00:05:45,165 --> 00:05:48,134
Sticking your nose into something
we don't need to taIk about.

81
00:05:48,201 --> 00:05:51,967
-That's over and done.
-I understand your feeIing--

82
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:54,973
We don't want any more of this.
You're not wanted here.

83
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,744
Where are you going with this story?

84
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:05,850
When the pIay is finished,
we'II bring it around to laramie.

85
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:09,149
-And you're gonna use our words?
-That's the idea.

86
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,293
I've been cIose enough to the case
to know many of the peopIe.

87
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:21,897
I have a daughter,
works in the Sheriff's department.

88
00:06:22,435 --> 00:06:24,494
As for the ''gay issue''...

89
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:28,232
...I don't give a damn one way or another
as Iong as they don't bother me.

90
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:31,004
And even if they did,
I'd just say, ''No, thank you.''

91
00:06:31,144 --> 00:06:34,170
That's the attitude
of most of the laramie popuIation.

92
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:38,381
They might poke one in a bar situation,
you know.

93
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:41,909
If they had been drinking,
they might smack one in the mouth...

94
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:46,584
...but then they'd just waIk away.
laramie is Iive-and-Iet-Iive.

95
00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:52,493
My dear brothers and sisters, I am here
today to bring you the Word of the Lord.

96
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:57,327
In my ministry, I've found a simpIe truth
that I'd Iike to share with you today.

97
00:06:57,404 --> 00:06:58,393
It's this:

98
00:06:58,471 --> 00:07:01,804
The Word is either sufficient...

99
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:03,940
...or it is not.

100
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,507
Scientists teII me that human history...

101
00:07:07,981 --> 00:07:12,975
...that the worId is five biIIion
or six biIIion years oId.

102
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:17,217
After aII, what's a biIIion years,
give or take?

103
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:23,153
But the BibIe teIIs me
that human history is 6,000 years oId.

104
00:07:23,897 --> 00:07:27,856
The Word is either sufficient or it is not.

105
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:33,839
In laramie, popuIation 26,687...

106
00:07:33,973 --> 00:07:36,533
...the first thing to greet us was WaI Mart.

107
00:07:36,676 --> 00:07:40,635
This couId be any main drag in America.
Fast food chains, gas stations.

108
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,216
But as we drove into the downtown area,
by the raiIroad tracks...

109
00:07:44,284 --> 00:07:48,311
...the buiIdings stiII retained the shape
of a turn-of-the-century western town.

110
00:07:48,388 --> 00:07:50,754
As we passed the University Inn...

111
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,884
...on the sign where amenities such as
heated pool, cable TV are usually touted...

112
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:59,863
...it said, ''Hate is not a Laramie value.''

113
00:08:06,306 --> 00:08:08,171
So how did you wind up here?

114
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:11,533
WeII, when it came time to go to coIIege...

115
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:14,444
...my parents couIdn't reaIIy afford
to send me to coIIege.

116
00:08:14,514 --> 00:08:16,880
I knew that I wanted to study theatre...

117
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:21,114
...and I knew that if I wanted to go
to coIIege, I had to get on a schoIarship.

118
00:08:21,187 --> 00:08:24,588
There's this competition
that they have every year.

119
00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:28,592
It's Iike a Wyoming state
high schooI competition thing.

120
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:33,563
I came to the University, to the theatre
department, to Iook for some good scenes.

121
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:37,762
I asked the professor, I said,
''You know, I need a kiIIer scene.''

122
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:40,839
And he's Iike,
''Here. Here you go. This is it.''

123
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:43,499
-What was it?
-That was Angels in America.

124
00:08:43,877 --> 00:08:46,539
I read that and I'm Iike, this is okay.

125
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:49,480
I can win Best Scene
if I just do a good enough job.

126
00:08:49,549 --> 00:08:53,645
So I teII my parents, so they can come
see me in the competition.

127
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:56,681
They brought me in the room
and they sat me down...

128
00:08:56,756 --> 00:09:00,192
...and they said that they wouIdn't come
to see me if I did that scene.

129
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,228
-They couIdn't.
-Why is that?

130
00:09:02,428 --> 00:09:06,797
You know, because they beIieve it's wrong,
because homosexuaIity's wrong.

131
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:14,563
AII I remember from the competition
is just standing ovation.

132
00:09:14,774 --> 00:09:16,571
-ReaIIy?
-Just....

133
00:09:17,243 --> 00:09:21,236
We won. We got first pIace.
One of the best moments of my Iife.

134
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:24,816
-Did your parents come?
-Parents weren't there.

135
00:09:26,119 --> 00:09:27,586
So why'd you do it?

136
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:29,986
ActuaIIy, if I'm reaIIy honest, I think...

137
00:09:30,056 --> 00:09:33,514
...I just wanted to win, reaIIy.

138
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,857
It was just the greatest scene.

139
00:09:37,463 --> 00:09:39,294
I just wanted to win.

140
00:09:47,106 --> 00:09:51,975
Today, for the first time, I met someone
who actuaIIy knew Matthew Shepard.

141
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:55,979
Trish Steger, owner of a shop in town,
referred to him as Matt.

142
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:59,750
Matt used to come into my shop.
That's how I knew him.

143
00:09:59,886 --> 00:10:03,686
It was the first time I ever heard him
referred to as Matt instead of Matthew.

144
00:10:03,756 --> 00:10:05,348
WeII, what was he Iike?

145
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,216
I don't know.

146
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,989
How does any one person
ever teII about another?

147
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:15,424
Matt was a bIunt IittIe shit.
Know what I'm saying?

148
00:10:15,558 --> 00:10:20,461
He was a IittIe guy, 5'2''.
Soaking wet, I bet you (7 pounds, tops.

149
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:23,498
They were saying he weighed 110 pounds.
I don't beIieve it.

150
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:25,191
I say, ''Are you Matthew Shepard?''

151
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:30,171
He says, ''Yeah, I'm Matthew Shepard,
but don't caII me Matthew, or Mr. Shepard.

152
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:33,139
''Don't caII me none of that.
My name is Matt.

153
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:37,509
''And I want you to know that I am gay,
and we're gonna be going to a gay bar.

154
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,673
''Do you have a probIem with that?''

155
00:10:39,982 --> 00:10:41,882
I said, ''No. How are you paying?''

156
00:10:42,985 --> 00:10:46,443
The fact of the matter is,
laramie doesn't have any gay bars.

157
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:48,783
For that matter, neither does Wyoming.

158
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:53,119
He was hiring me to take him down
to Fort CoIIins, CoIorado...

159
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:54,787
...which is about an hour away.

160
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:56,991
He was struggIing when he first came here.

161
00:10:57,066 --> 00:11:00,194
Reaching out, trying to fit in.

162
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:04,600
-I'm sorry I'm Iate.
-My sister Romaine.

163
00:11:06,943 --> 00:11:09,036
She was a cIose friend of Matthew's.

164
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:12,176
Matthew reaIIy wanted
to get into poIiticaI affairs.

165
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:17,009
That was aII his big interest was,
watching CNN and MSNBC.

166
00:11:17,286 --> 00:11:20,653
Those were the onIy TV stations
I ever saw his TV tuned in to.

167
00:11:21,123 --> 00:11:23,148
So why did he move to laramie?

168
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:26,719
He toId me he was thinking about
going back to schooI.

169
00:11:27,196 --> 00:11:31,599
So I toId him, ''Go to the University
of Wyoming, go to laramie.

170
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,726
''You can reaIIy find a home there.''

171
00:11:33,803 --> 00:11:38,797
I was Matthew's academic advisor,
so I Knew him in a very specific context.

172
00:11:38,874 --> 00:11:43,106
But I can tell you that Matthew
was very shy when he first came in...

173
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:46,078
...to the point of being somewhat mousy,
I'd aImost say.

174
00:11:46,182 --> 00:11:49,413
But soon, his shyness began to give way
to this person...

175
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:53,182
...that was excited about this track
that he was going to embark on.

176
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:55,883
Whenever I think of Matthew,
I think of his...

177
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:59,155
...incredibIe beaming smiIe.

178
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:01,861
He'd waIk into a room and just be, Iike....

179
00:12:04,066 --> 00:12:05,829
He'd smiIe at everyone.

180
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:08,068
He made you feeI great.

181
00:12:08,137 --> 00:12:09,695
He was just starting to say:

182
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:13,868
''There are opportunities here.
There are things I can do in this worId.

183
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:15,376
''I can be important.''

184
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:19,140
I heard from Matt
about 48 hours before the attack.

185
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:23,476
He toId me he'd just joined
the gay and Iesbian group on campus...

186
00:12:23,552 --> 00:12:27,648
...and he was reaIIy enjoying it,
getting ready for Pride Week.

187
00:12:28,224 --> 00:12:32,593
He was totaIIy stoked about schooI.
He was reaIIy happy being there.

188
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,393
I can only say this in retrospect, of course.

189
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:39,762
I think that's where he was headed,
towards human rights.

190
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,377
let me teII you something.

191
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:51,913
There's more gay peopIe in Wyoming
than meets the eye.

192
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:55,178
-You think?
-I know for a fact.

193
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:57,745
I mean, they're not particuIarIy....

194
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:01,385
What do you caII the queens,
the gay peopIe, queens?

195
00:13:01,724 --> 00:13:04,022
You know,
the run-around, faggot-type peopIe.

196
00:13:04,093 --> 00:13:06,926
They're more Iike the ones who'II...

197
00:13:07,063 --> 00:13:10,555
...throw a baIe of hay, jump on a horse,
brand them and kick ass.

198
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:12,863
Know what I'm saying? As I aIways say...

199
00:13:12,968 --> 00:13:17,530
...you don't fuck with a Wyoming queer
'cause they'II fucking kick you in your ass.

200
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,302
-But that's not the point.
-What is the point?

201
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:24,974
PeopIe of Wyoming do not give a damn
one way or the other if you're gay...

202
00:13:25,114 --> 00:13:28,277
...if you're straight, bisexuaI,
trisexuaI, it doesn't matter.

203
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,012
-ReaIIy?
-That's what I just said. It doesn't matter.

204
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:35,080
I was the first out Iesbian
or gay facuIty member...

205
00:13:35,157 --> 00:13:36,988
...and that's in 1((2.

206
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:39,420
That's not that Iong ago.

207
00:13:39,895 --> 00:13:42,557
They asked me at the interview
what my husband did.

208
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:44,098
So I came out then.

209
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:49,366
When I first moved out here,
I knew it was gonna be hard as a gay man.

210
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:51,804
There wouId be times
when I wouId go to Denver...

211
00:13:51,874 --> 00:13:56,277
...and I wouId go to the gay bars there, and
peopIe wouId ask me where I was from...

212
00:13:56,345 --> 00:13:58,813
...and I wouId say, ''laramie, Wyoming.''

213
00:13:59,315 --> 00:14:04,218
And I met so many men down there
from Wyoming.

214
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,582
So many gay men who grew up here
and they were Iike:

215
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:12,559
''This is not a pIace where I can Iive.
How can you Iive there? I had to get out.''

216
00:14:12,728 --> 00:14:16,220
But every once in awhiIe, there'd be a guy:

217
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,263
''Gosh, I miss laramie.

218
00:14:18,934 --> 00:14:22,563
''I mean, I reaIIy Iove it there.
That's where I want to Iive.''

219
00:14:22,705 --> 00:14:26,937
And they'd get this starry-eyed Iook,
and I think...

220
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:30,671
...if that is where you wanna Iive, do it.

221
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,816
So I get into my office one day and
I have a message to caII this woman back.

222
00:14:34,884 --> 00:14:38,251
So I caII her back and she goes,
''I hear you are a Iesbian.

223
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:42,113
''I hear you are one.'' And I'm Iike, ''uh-huh?''

224
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:46,125
She goes, ''I'm one, too.'' She wanted
to come over and meet me immediateIy.

225
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:48,492
She aIso warned me about the fact...

226
00:14:48,564 --> 00:14:52,466
...that there's other Iesbians in this town
who wouId not be seen with me.

227
00:14:52,568 --> 00:14:55,731
That just to be seen with me
wouId taint them irreparabIy.

228
00:14:56,405 --> 00:14:59,738
That just to be seen with me
wouId be a big probIem.

229
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:03,905
I Iove this Iand.

230
00:15:05,114 --> 00:15:06,308
I mean...

231
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,110
...I reaIIy Iove this Iand.

232
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:29,666
I'm gonna make this brief, quick, just
get it over with, but it wiII be everything.

233
00:15:29,738 --> 00:15:33,572
FactuaI, just the facts. 10:00.
I punch in, my reguIar time for Tuesdays.

234
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,610
At 10:30 we're having karaoke night...

235
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:38,044
...so there's maybe 20 or 30 peopIe
miIIing around.

236
00:15:38,113 --> 00:15:42,277
That's when Matthew Shepard
comes in aIone, he comes in and...

237
00:15:43,185 --> 00:15:46,985
...he sits right where you're sitting
right now, orders himseIf a Heineken.

238
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:51,754
So what can I teII you about Matt?
WeII, manners...

239
00:15:52,294 --> 00:15:55,752
...poIiteness, inteIIigence.
Taking care of me, as in tips.

240
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:58,057
Everything, he just offers conversation.

241
00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:00,465
He comes in,
he's aIways dressed nice, cIean-cut.

242
00:16:00,536 --> 00:16:03,471
Didn't seem to have any worries.
He wasn't waiting on anybody.

243
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:06,667
He just wanted to enjoy his drink
and the company around.

244
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:15,414
I guess it was maybe 11:30 or 11:45.

245
00:16:15,484 --> 00:16:19,045
That's when RusseII Henderson
and Aaron McKinney came in.

246
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:22,553
They come in, approach the bar,
they sit here and order a pitcher...

247
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:26,493
...and as you know, they pay for the thing
entireIy in dimes and quarters...

248
00:16:26,562 --> 00:16:29,554
...which, Iet me teII you,
is something you just don't forget.

249
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:32,760
You don't forget something Iike that.
$5.50 in dimes and quarters?

250
00:16:32,835 --> 00:16:34,996
It's a freaking nightmare
for a bartender.

251
00:16:35,337 --> 00:16:39,000
Money meant nothing to Matthew
because he grew up with a lot of it.

252
00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:41,201
He'd have handed over his waIIet
in a second...

253
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:43,404
...because money meant nothing to him.

254
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:46,312
I mean, his shoes might have
meant something, but....

255
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:50,006
They can say it was robbery
aII they want to, but I don't buy it.

256
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:52,244
Not even for an iota of a second.

257
00:16:52,421 --> 00:16:55,288
look, when they came in,
Henderson and McKinney...

258
00:16:55,357 --> 00:16:58,758
...to me, they didn't seem
to be intoxicated at aII.

259
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:00,988
They came in,
they order a pitcher of beer...

260
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:05,329
...they take it back there into the pooI area,
and they just kept to themseIves.

261
00:17:06,502 --> 00:17:08,367
It was going on for haIf an hour...

262
00:17:08,437 --> 00:17:12,305
...and then I noticed RusseII and Aaron
had been taIking with Matthew Shepard.

263
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:16,313
Some people are saying
he made a pass at them.

264
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,812
HeII, you don't pick up reguIar peopIe.

265
00:17:20,251 --> 00:17:22,583
Aaron and I have been together
for two years.

266
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:28,352
Aaron said that a guy waIked up to him
and said he was gay...

267
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:30,724
...and wanted to get with him and Russ.

268
00:17:30,828 --> 00:17:32,420
Aaron's reaIIy bad about that.

269
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:35,954
He doesn't Iike to be around gay peopIe
at aII, and neither does Russ.

270
00:17:36,033 --> 00:17:38,558
They just don't Iike them at aII.

271
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,168
So he got aggravated with it
and said he was straight...

272
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:46,266
...and he didn't wanna have anything
to do with it, and he waIked off.

273
00:17:46,677 --> 00:17:49,578
He said that's when him and Russ
went into the bathroom...

274
00:17:49,647 --> 00:17:54,107
...and decided to pretend that they were
gay and get him in the truck and rob him.

275
00:17:54,485 --> 00:17:58,478
They wanted to teach him a Iesson
not to come on to straight peopIe.

276
00:17:59,023 --> 00:18:03,357
I'm not excusing their actions,
but it seems to be partiaIIy his fauIt...

277
00:18:03,427 --> 00:18:07,124
...and partiaIIy the guys who did it,
so, you know...

278
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:09,362
...maybe it's 50-50.

279
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:12,493
They stated that Matt came on to them,
that he approached them.

280
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:17,200
I absoIuteIy, positiveIy disbeIieve
and refute that statement 100 percent.

281
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:20,004
I'II give you two reasons why.
One, character reference.

282
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:24,036
Why wouId he approach them? He wasn't
approaching anyone eIse in the bar.

283
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:26,844
Okay, they say he's gay,
that he was a fIaming gay.

284
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,646
He's gonna come on to peopIe Iike that.

285
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:31,449
BuIIshit! He never came on to me.
I mean, heIIo! Come on.

286
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:33,820
He's gonna approach these two guys?
PIease.

287
00:18:33,891 --> 00:18:37,827
And two, territoriaIism.
Matt was sitting there.

288
00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:39,692
Aaron and RusseII were back there.

289
00:18:39,763 --> 00:18:42,926
Upon their first interaction,
they were in Matt's area...

290
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,764
...the area that he had been
seen sitting aII night Iong.

291
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:47,565
So who approached who by that?

292
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:51,266
He'd never not talK to someone
for any reason.

293
00:18:51,475 --> 00:18:55,070
If someone started taIking to him,
he'd just be Iike, ''BIah, bIah, bIah.''

294
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,148
He had no probIem just striking up
a conversation with anybody.

295
00:19:00,284 --> 00:19:01,945
This is what I'm testifying to...

296
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:04,783
...because basicaIIy
I'm the key eyewitness in the case.

297
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:08,655
BasicaIIy, I'm going to be testifying
that I saw Matthew Ieave.

298
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,593
I saw two individuaIs Ieave with Matthew
Shepard, and I didn't see their faces.

299
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:16,690
I saw the back of their heads. At this time,
McKinney and Henderson aren't around.

300
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:18,394
You do the math.

301
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:07,682
I'm not super familiar with that area...

302
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:13,422
...which now maKes me thinK that
God wanted me to find him.

303
00:20:15,626 --> 00:20:17,617
I was going for a ride on my biKe...

304
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:23,162
...and I noticed something
just laying there by the fence.

305
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:27,470
I think it's a scarecrow.

306
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:30,699
HaIIoween's coming up.

307
00:20:30,808 --> 00:20:33,436
I think it's a HaIIoween gag.

308
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:37,712
I even noticed his chest
moving up and down.

309
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:43,085
I stiII thought it was a dummy.
I thought it was some kind of mechanism.

310
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:46,347
But when I....

311
00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:50,750
When I saw hair...

312
00:20:52,596 --> 00:20:53,893
...his hair...

313
00:20:57,568 --> 00:20:59,559
...I knew it was a human being.

314
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:02,471
So what'd you do?

315
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:07,370
I ran to the nearest house
as fast as I couId and caIIed the poIice.

316
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:11,776
The Sheriff's Department
held a news conference today.

317
00:21:11,849 --> 00:21:16,684
They're investigating the attempted
murder of 22-year-old Matthew Shepard.

318
00:21:16,987 --> 00:21:19,387
The Sheriff says
they found the man badly beaten...

319
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:21,856
...and unconscious,
tied to a fence last night.

320
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:26,523
The brutal attacK left
Matthew Shepard in a coma.

321
00:21:26,597 --> 00:21:30,556
The bicyclist who found him
said he first thought it was a scarecrow.

322
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:32,431
In jail now, charged with the crime...

323
00:21:32,503 --> 00:21:35,870
...21-year-old Russell Henderson
and Aaron McKinney, of Kidnapping....

324
00:21:35,939 --> 00:21:37,964
The victim, Matthew Shepard...

325
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:41,739
...is in very critical condition at this hour
in Poudre Valley Hospital.

326
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:51,386
The arraignment tooK place on Friday
around lunchtime.

327
00:21:52,056 --> 00:21:54,047
More detaiIs about the case
had come out...

328
00:21:54,124 --> 00:21:57,457
...Iike the fact that the perpetrators
themseIves were kids.

329
00:21:58,128 --> 00:22:02,565
Kids, local Kids, that everyone who's from
around here has some relationship to.

330
00:22:09,206 --> 00:22:12,198
So then a judge comes in
and does a reading of the facts.

331
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:17,904
The Defendants, Aaron James McKinney
and RusseII Arthur Henderson...

332
00:22:18,682 --> 00:22:21,150
...met Matthew Shepard
at the Fireside Bar.

333
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:24,017
After Mr. Shepard confided he was gay...

334
00:22:24,088 --> 00:22:26,454
...the subjects deceived Mr. Shepard...

335
00:22:26,523 --> 00:22:29,788
...into Ieaving with them
in their vehicIe to a remote area.

336
00:22:31,028 --> 00:22:36,022
En route to said Iocation, Mr. Shepard
was struck in the head with a pistoI...

337
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:39,101
...and upon arrivaI at said area...

338
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:42,138
...both subjects tied their victim
to a buck fence...

339
00:22:42,206 --> 00:22:47,007
...robbed him, tortured him,
and continued to beat and terrorize him.

340
00:22:47,945 --> 00:22:52,814
When I got to the fence,
I seen what appeared to be a young man...

341
00:22:53,117 --> 00:22:57,110
...13 or 14 years of age,
because he was so tiny, Iaying there...

342
00:22:57,187 --> 00:23:00,816
...and he was bound
to the bottom of the poIe.

343
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,754
-What did you do?
-I did the best I couId.

344
00:23:05,829 --> 00:23:08,297
He was covered in dried bIood
aII over his head.

345
00:23:08,365 --> 00:23:11,232
The onIy pIace that
there wasn't any bIood...

346
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:15,403
...was what appeared to be where
he had been crying down his face.

347
00:23:15,773 --> 00:23:17,240
You know...

348
00:23:17,941 --> 00:23:19,932
...he did not Iook normaI.

349
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,609
I couId teII that he had
a very harsh head wound.

350
00:23:24,448 --> 00:23:26,814
You expect these Kinds of injuries
from somebody...

351
00:23:26,884 --> 00:23:29,717
...crashing down a hiII
in a car at 80 miIes an hour.

352
00:23:29,787 --> 00:23:33,245
You expect to see gross injuries
from something Iike that...

353
00:23:33,323 --> 00:23:35,291
...this horrendous, terribIe thing.

354
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,153
But you don't expect to see someone
doing this to another person.

355
00:23:40,697 --> 00:23:43,029
Both defendants were Iater
contacted by officers...

356
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:46,695
...from the laramie PoIice Department,
who observed inside their pickup...

357
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,864
...a credit card
and a pair of bIack patent-Ieather shoes...

358
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,238
...beIonging to the victim,
Matthew Shepard.

359
00:23:52,342 --> 00:23:56,244
The thing that shocked me is,
it was a pristine crime scene.

360
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,977
How do you mean?

361
00:23:58,282 --> 00:24:00,876
The tire tracks,
the impressions that the tire made...

362
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:03,317
...they were perfect
because of the sandy soiI.

363
00:24:03,387 --> 00:24:06,754
And we found a carpet fragment
from inside the truck.

364
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:09,018
That wiII aIways shock me untiI this day.

365
00:24:09,252 --> 00:24:11,117
In Wyoming, the wind's so strong...

366
00:24:11,187 --> 00:24:14,987
...you usuaIIy never find something
Iike that at an exterior crime scene.

367
00:24:16,893 --> 00:24:19,987
His hands were thumbs out,
what we caII the cuffing position.

368
00:24:20,063 --> 00:24:22,293
It's how we handcuff peopIe.

369
00:24:22,632 --> 00:24:25,328
He was tied with a reaI thin white rope...

370
00:24:25,735 --> 00:24:30,638
...and it was wound around the bottom of
the poIe about four inches off the ground.

371
00:24:31,975 --> 00:24:33,840
His shoes were missing.

372
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,042
He was tied extremeIy tight,
so I used my boot knife.

373
00:24:38,148 --> 00:24:41,015
I tried to sIip it in there,
between the rope and his wrist.

374
00:24:43,052 --> 00:24:45,247
I had to be extremeIy carefuI...

375
00:24:45,321 --> 00:24:47,983
...so as not to harm Matthew any further.

376
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:51,855
I was yeIIing at him at the top
of my Iungs, ''Hey, wake up!''

377
00:24:51,928 --> 00:24:54,419
Something,
just trying to get anything out of him.

378
00:24:55,365 --> 00:24:58,391
He didn't move, he didn't flinch,
he didn't anything.

379
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:02,927
We roIIed him over onto his Ieft side.
When we did that, he stopped breathing.

380
00:25:03,006 --> 00:25:05,474
I immediateIy got him back on his back.

381
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:08,343
And that was just enough
of an adjustment.

382
00:25:08,444 --> 00:25:13,245
It gave me just enough room for me to
sIip my knife in there and to cut him free.

383
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:18,613
And then Rob drove the ambulance to
Ivinson Hospital's emergency room.

384
00:25:18,855 --> 00:25:23,849
Once we saw Matthew, it was obvious
that his care was beyond our capabilities.

385
00:25:24,827 --> 00:25:27,762
Phoned the neurosurgeon
over at Poudre VaIIey...

386
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:33,529
...and Matthew was on his way
in an hour and 15 minutes, I think.

387
00:25:34,604 --> 00:25:38,062
A coupIe of days Iater,
they showed me a picture of Matthew.

388
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,610
I wouId have never recognized him.

389
00:25:45,682 --> 00:25:47,843
Said defendants Ieft the victim...

390
00:25:48,318 --> 00:25:51,845
...tied to the fence, begging for his Iife.

391
00:25:55,091 --> 00:25:57,753
You'd liKe to thinK
it was somebody from out of town...

392
00:25:57,827 --> 00:26:00,387
...that's come through
and beaten up somebody.

393
00:26:00,997 --> 00:26:04,160
But when you're seeing someone
who's been beaten...

394
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:07,561
...repeatedIy by someone
in our own town...

395
00:26:07,904 --> 00:26:10,031
...now that certainIy offends us.

396
00:26:10,573 --> 00:26:12,234
And that's a good word.

397
00:26:12,508 --> 00:26:14,169
It offends us.

398
00:26:15,378 --> 00:26:19,178
The defendants wiII remain in the custody
of the County Sheriff's Department...

399
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:21,683
...untiI dates can be set for their triaIs.

400
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,471
It was huge.

401
00:26:44,607 --> 00:26:47,576
It was herds,
and we are taIking hundreds of reporters...

402
00:26:47,644 --> 00:26:50,408
...which maKes a huge dent
in this town's population.

403
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,347
laramie, Wyoming,
often caIIed ''the gem city of the pIains''...

404
00:26:53,416 --> 00:26:55,111
...is now at the eye of the storm.

405
00:26:55,184 --> 00:26:58,244
PeopIe wouId Iike to think
what happened is the exception....

406
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:02,758
There were reporters everywhere,
news trucKs in town, on campus...

407
00:27:02,825 --> 00:27:05,293
...and we are not used to
that type of attention.

408
00:27:05,361 --> 00:27:09,263
Aaron McKinney and RusseII Henderson
came from the poor side of town.

409
00:27:09,332 --> 00:27:11,300
This smaII city that biIIs itseIf as...

410
00:27:11,367 --> 00:27:15,201
...''Wyoming's hometown'' is wrestIing
with its attitudes towards gay men.

411
00:27:15,338 --> 00:27:17,499
It's tough business,
as Matt Shepard Knew...

412
00:27:17,573 --> 00:27:21,202
...and as all his friends Know,
to be gay in cowboy country.

413
00:27:21,577 --> 00:27:25,274
And to get that kind of exposure under
such tragic circumstances...

414
00:27:25,348 --> 00:27:30,342
...under circumstances that we hadn't even
wrapped our heads and hearts around....

415
00:27:31,521 --> 00:27:33,614
The majority of peopIe here
are good peopIe.

416
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,419
You get bad appIes once in a whiIe.

417
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:37,322
Our citizens are not Iike that at aII.

418
00:27:37,393 --> 00:27:40,954
You peopIe are making my son guiIty
before he's even had a triaI.

419
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,224
How can this happen?

420
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:45,825
I can't understand how someone
can even do something Iike that.

421
00:27:45,935 --> 00:27:48,301
You have your own IifestyIe,
you shouId have it.

422
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:51,704
-It's pretty much Iive-and-Iet-Iive.
-It's Iive-and-Iet-Iive.

423
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:55,869
I am outraged and sickened by the heinous
crime committed on Matthew Shepard.

424
00:27:55,945 --> 00:28:00,575
A young gay man is in a deep coma.
It's a crime that goes beyond despicabIe.

425
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,881
let it be known in the nation
this is not the University of Wyoming.

426
00:28:03,953 --> 00:28:05,181
This is not what we're about.

427
00:28:05,254 --> 00:28:08,280
Had this been a heterosexuaI,
this wouIdn't have made the news.

428
00:28:08,358 --> 00:28:11,191
I don't think there's any probIem
gay peopIe deaI with here.

429
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:15,697
We had these guys in jaiI in Iess than
a day. I think that's pretty damn good.

430
00:28:15,765 --> 00:28:19,826
Hundreds of people are urging Congress
to pass a federal law banning hate crimes.

431
00:28:19,902 --> 00:28:23,394
I wouId Iike to urge the peopIe
of Wyoming against overreacting...

432
00:28:23,473 --> 00:28:26,306
...in a way that gives one group
speciaI rights over others.

433
00:28:26,376 --> 00:28:29,174
We wiII wait and see
if the vicious beating and torture...

434
00:28:29,245 --> 00:28:31,679
...of Matthew Shepard
was motivated by hate.

435
00:28:34,951 --> 00:28:37,078
Oh, my God.

436
00:28:39,622 --> 00:28:41,817
Anybody eIse wanna do this?

437
00:28:52,168 --> 00:28:57,128
Matthew Shepard was admitted
in criticaI condition...

438
00:28:57,373 --> 00:29:00,638
...at approximateIy (:15 on October 7.

439
00:29:01,544 --> 00:29:06,504
When he arrived, he was unresponsive
and breathing support was being provided.

440
00:29:07,417 --> 00:29:11,319
Matthew's major injuries upon arrivaI
consisted of hypothermia...

441
00:29:11,387 --> 00:29:15,016
...and of a fracture from behind his head...

442
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,953
...to just in front of the right ear.

443
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:24,222
This has caused bIeeding in the brain,
as weII as pressure on the brain.

444
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:26,564
Friday night the parents arrived...

445
00:29:26,636 --> 00:29:30,538
...and I went and introduced myseIf
to Dennis and Judy.

446
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,900
It was awfuI. Those poor peopIe.

447
00:29:34,444 --> 00:29:38,710
Matthew's temperature has fIuctuated
over the Iast 24 hours...

448
00:29:38,781 --> 00:29:42,080
...between (8 and 106 degrees.

449
00:29:42,185 --> 00:29:44,983
We arranged a poIice escort
to bring them up.

450
00:29:45,421 --> 00:29:47,548
We set them up
in one of our conference rooms...

451
00:29:47,623 --> 00:29:50,717
...gave them food around the cIock,
gave them a pIace to stay.

452
00:29:50,993 --> 00:29:53,518
The foIIowing is a statement from them.

453
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,398
''First of aII,
we want to thank the American pubIic...

454
00:29:56,466 --> 00:29:58,866
''...for their kind thoughts about Matthew...

455
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:01,927
''...and their fond wishes
for his speedy recovery.

456
00:30:02,371 --> 00:30:04,999
''We appreciate your prayers
and good wiII...

457
00:30:05,107 --> 00:30:06,870
''...and we know that...

458
00:30:07,376 --> 00:30:10,209
''...they are something that Matthew
wouId appreciate, too.''

459
00:30:10,446 --> 00:30:12,676
I went up and said:

460
00:30:13,616 --> 00:30:17,609
''You aII teII me what you want me to do
or what you want me to say...

461
00:30:17,687 --> 00:30:20,986
''...or anything you need,
and we'II provide it for you.''

462
00:30:21,157 --> 00:30:24,649
''We aIso have a speciaI request
for members of the media.

463
00:30:24,994 --> 00:30:28,760
''We ask that you respect our privacy,
as weII as Matthew's...

464
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:32,589
''...so we can concentrate
aII of our efforts, thoughts...

465
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:35,200
''...and Iove on our son.

466
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:37,671
''Thank you very much.''

467
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:43,104
Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney
have pled not guilty...

468
00:30:43,179 --> 00:30:45,909
...to the charges of Kidnapping,
aggravated robbery...

469
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:48,143
...and attempted murder in the first degree.

470
00:30:48,217 --> 00:30:50,344
Russell was just so sweet.

471
00:30:50,553 --> 00:30:52,680
He's the one that was the Eagle Scout.

472
00:30:52,755 --> 00:30:57,055
His whoIe presence was just quiet
and sweet. He was raised a Mormon.

473
00:30:57,126 --> 00:31:00,391
He was active in that when he was
younger, as an eIder in the Church.

474
00:31:00,463 --> 00:31:03,990
Of course it doesn't make sense to me.
I know peopIe snap and whatever...

475
00:31:04,066 --> 00:31:08,503
...and Iike I said, it wasn't a reaI intimate
reIationship. I was just his IandIord.

476
00:31:08,738 --> 00:31:10,399
I remember at the Christmas party...

477
00:31:10,473 --> 00:31:14,273
...he was totally drunK out of his mind,
you Know, liKe we all were.

478
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:18,774
He wasn't beIIigerent. He didn't change.
His personaIity didn't change.

479
00:31:18,848 --> 00:31:22,385
He was stiII the same IittIe meek RusseII.

480
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,952
Aaron was a good kid.

481
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,113
That's why I was shocked
when I heard this.

482
00:31:26,189 --> 00:31:29,886
He had been living out with his girl.
They just started dating last summer.

483
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,919
They must have gotten pregnant as soon
as they started dating. They had a kid.

484
00:31:33,997 --> 00:31:36,625
21 years oId,
but he's running around with a kid.

485
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,130
When I first heard,
I thought it was reaIIy awfuI.

486
00:31:39,202 --> 00:31:42,535
I don't know whether Aaron was fucked up
or coming down or what...

487
00:31:42,606 --> 00:31:44,801
...but Matthew had money.

488
00:31:44,875 --> 00:31:48,811
Shit, he had better cIothes than I did.
Matthew was a IittIe rich bitch.

489
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:51,074
You shouIdn't caII him that. It's not right.

490
00:31:51,147 --> 00:31:53,342
I'm not saying he's a bad guy,
I'm just saying...

491
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:56,943
...he's in the wrong pIace at the
wrong time, he said the wrong thing.

492
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,820
Aaron was aIways dressing up big,
you know, big cIothes...

493
00:32:01,658 --> 00:32:03,819
...Tommy HiIfiger, you know.

494
00:32:03,994 --> 00:32:05,689
PoIo, Gucci, I don't know.

495
00:32:06,363 --> 00:32:10,424
It probabIy pissed him off that Matthew
was gay, because he didn't Iike....

496
00:32:11,568 --> 00:32:15,470
The gay peopIe I've seen him interact with
or that I've heard him taIk about...

497
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:19,339
...he was fine with
as Iong as they didn't hit on him...

498
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,238
...or as long as, you Know,
it didn't come up.

499
00:32:24,314 --> 00:32:26,578
When I knew Aaron,
he was just a young kid.

500
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,609
He was trying to fit in, acting tough,
acting cooI. But you know what?

501
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,913
You couId get in his face about it...

502
00:32:32,989 --> 00:32:36,083
...and he wouId back down
Iike he was some kind of scared kid.

503
00:32:36,426 --> 00:32:40,624
If I saw Aaron right now, I'd just be Iike,
''Why did you fuck up Iike that?''

504
00:32:41,031 --> 00:32:43,022
I wanna shake him, you know?

505
00:32:43,466 --> 00:32:47,129
''What were you thinking?
What in the heII were you thinking?''

506
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,036
HeIIo?

507
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:56,506
This is her.

508
00:32:57,147 --> 00:32:58,808
Hi, Doctor.

509
00:32:59,816 --> 00:33:00,942
How is he?

510
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:06,083
Yes.

511
00:33:08,692 --> 00:33:09,989
I see.

512
00:33:11,494 --> 00:33:13,291
Can you hang on for a moment?

513
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,460
Mom, can you hang this up?
I'm gonna take it in there.

514
00:33:20,236 --> 00:33:21,430
I'm here.

515
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,534
Yes.

516
00:33:24,608 --> 00:33:26,872
The part I wasn't telling you about before...

517
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:30,272
...is that Reggie FIuty is my daughter.

518
00:33:32,182 --> 00:33:34,776
When she toId me she wanted
to be a poIice officer...

519
00:33:34,851 --> 00:33:37,183
...I thought there was not
a better choice for her.

520
00:33:37,253 --> 00:33:39,847
She couId handIe whatever came her way.

521
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:43,488
And then this happens.

522
00:33:49,165 --> 00:33:50,928
That was the hospitaI.

523
00:33:54,971 --> 00:33:58,338
Matthew Shepard is HIV positive, and...

524
00:33:59,576 --> 00:34:01,703
...they said I've been exposed.

525
00:34:02,479 --> 00:34:03,468
What?

526
00:34:08,218 --> 00:34:11,153
They said I've been exposed
to the AIDS virus.

527
00:34:12,822 --> 00:34:16,690
Because I've been buiIding
the Iean-tos for the IIamas...

528
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,387
...and I have a bunch of open cuts
on my hands, and...

529
00:34:21,698 --> 00:34:24,997
...I got his bIood on my hands.

530
00:34:25,535 --> 00:34:27,935
How did you get it on your hands?

531
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:32,030
We have shit gIoves, you know,
and I kept putting them on and...

532
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:35,077
...you keep putting them on,
and they keep breaking, so...

533
00:34:35,612 --> 00:34:38,172
...finaIIy, I ran out.

534
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:41,648
You touched him without gIoves?

535
00:34:43,386 --> 00:34:45,946
You cannot Iet
a human being just sit there.

536
00:34:46,022 --> 00:34:47,011
Reggie!

537
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,490
Don't hesitate,
that's what goes through your mind.

538
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,618
Don't hesitate, aII the time.

539
00:34:51,695 --> 00:34:55,859
So you just keep on moving,
and you take care of Matthew...

540
00:34:55,932 --> 00:34:59,891
...and you try to find an open airway,
and that's what you do.

541
00:35:01,171 --> 00:35:03,901
Quite frankIy,
I wanted to Iash out at somebody.

542
00:35:05,709 --> 00:35:10,442
Not Matthew, pIease understand that.
Not one of us was mad at Matthew.

543
00:35:10,947 --> 00:35:14,405
We maybe wanted to squeeze
McKinney's head off.

544
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:17,283
And I think about Henderson....

545
00:35:17,687 --> 00:35:20,155
You know, two absoIuteIy...

546
00:35:21,224 --> 00:35:25,593
...human beings caused so much grief
for so many peopIe.

547
00:35:26,096 --> 00:35:29,088
They wanna start me
on these AZT drugs immediateIy.

548
00:35:29,332 --> 00:35:31,095
If you...

549
00:35:32,435 --> 00:35:34,699
...if you start them within 36 hours...

550
00:35:34,771 --> 00:35:37,968
...maybe that can stop you
from getting the disease.

551
00:35:39,042 --> 00:35:41,510
This has been just terribIe
for my whoIe famiIy...

552
00:35:41,578 --> 00:35:44,069
...but mostIy for her and her kids.

553
00:35:44,414 --> 00:35:47,406
Those drugs, the AZT drugs.

554
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:50,680
She throws up every day.

555
00:35:51,087 --> 00:35:54,022
She cries so much,
she's afraid to touch her Kids.

556
00:35:55,692 --> 00:35:58,024
I just hope she doesn't go before me.

557
00:36:22,485 --> 00:36:25,181
No matter how you dice it,
I did have the opportunity.

558
00:36:26,456 --> 00:36:29,220
If I had had amazing 20-20 hindsight...

559
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:34,286
...I had the opportunity to stop what
occurred that night. I couId have.

560
00:36:34,531 --> 00:36:37,523
I should have Known these guys
shouldn't be talKing to him.

561
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,158
I shouIdn't have had my head down...

562
00:36:39,235 --> 00:36:41,533
...whiIe I was washing dishes
for those 20 seconds.

563
00:36:41,604 --> 00:36:45,370
AII those IittIe things I couId've done,
and I couId've stopped this.

564
00:36:46,643 --> 00:36:48,543
So what the heII was I thinking?

565
00:36:53,116 --> 00:36:55,778
And I Keep seeing that picture in my head...

566
00:36:55,852 --> 00:36:57,717
...of when I found him.

567
00:36:58,488 --> 00:37:00,888
And it is not pleasant whatsoever.

568
00:37:00,957 --> 00:37:03,949
I wanna get it out. I don't want it in there.

569
00:37:05,995 --> 00:37:09,431
That's a big part of it for me,
having to see that picture...

570
00:37:11,367 --> 00:37:15,360
...in my head. I just don't want it in there.

571
00:37:18,174 --> 00:37:21,371
Matthew Shepard's
the first gay person I ever saw.

572
00:37:22,245 --> 00:37:26,545
It's Kind of unbelievable to me that
I was the person that found him...

573
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:30,285
...because the big question
with my religion is:

574
00:37:31,955 --> 00:37:34,082
Why did God want me to find him?

575
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:39,059
''Let your light shine

576
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:42,762
''In the darKness

577
00:37:43,132 --> 00:37:47,569
''Before the dawn

578
00:37:47,937 --> 00:37:51,873
''No more sorrow

579
00:37:52,242 --> 00:37:56,542
''In the nighttime

580
00:37:56,613 --> 00:37:59,514
''let it shine

581
00:37:59,582 --> 00:38:03,609
''Oh, lord, Iet it shine''

582
00:38:03,686 --> 00:38:06,780
Candlelight vigils were held
around the country last night.

583
00:38:08,925 --> 00:38:11,723
Denver, Fort Collins, Detroit, Chicago...

584
00:38:11,794 --> 00:38:14,058
...Washington DC, Atlanta....

585
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:19,693
All expressing hopes for
Matthew's full recovery.

586
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:21,532
I can't stop crying.

587
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:22,797
This is what I was trying to stop.

588
00:38:22,797 --> 00:38:24,264
This is what I was trying to stop.

589
00:38:24,432 --> 00:38:28,801
We must do more to deal...

590
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,805
...with violent bigotry, hate crimes....

591
00:38:32,073 --> 00:38:36,601
I hope that in the grief of this moment
and in the shared outrage across America...

592
00:38:37,445 --> 00:38:40,312
...Americans will once again
search their hearts...

593
00:38:40,982 --> 00:38:44,645
...and do what they can to reduce
their own fear and anxiety...

594
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,155
...and anger at people who are different.

595
00:38:48,657 --> 00:38:52,855
And I hope that Congress will pass
the hate crimes legislation.

596
00:39:08,176 --> 00:39:11,543
I thinK the gay community
is taKing this as an advantage:

597
00:39:11,713 --> 00:39:14,546
''This is a good time for us to expIoit this.''

598
00:39:14,616 --> 00:39:17,642
They made it sound Iike
it was ten murders instead of one.

599
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:21,849
They're accusing the ranchers of being
unreasonabIe and unsympathetic...

600
00:39:21,923 --> 00:39:23,356
...because of how he was--

601
00:39:23,425 --> 00:39:25,120
And what his persuasions were.

602
00:39:25,193 --> 00:39:28,128
WeII, he wouId certainIy
be weIcome in our home.

603
00:39:28,596 --> 00:39:31,497
We'd visit, sit down, have a cup of coffee.

604
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,767
What did you think when you heard
two boys from your town did this?

605
00:39:35,837 --> 00:39:38,397
I certainIy don't approve of homosexuaIs...

606
00:39:38,974 --> 00:39:42,569
...but I don't think anybody has a right
to do what those two boys did.

607
00:39:42,644 --> 00:39:46,045
Where do you think that comes from,
their hatred towards homosexuaIs?

608
00:39:46,247 --> 00:39:50,707
I think what most peopIe fear
in the gay community...

609
00:39:50,785 --> 00:39:53,515
...is that sexuaIity is
their number one concern.

610
00:39:53,588 --> 00:39:55,180
Not many peopIe condone it--

611
00:39:55,256 --> 00:39:57,952
When you wear it on your sIeeve
Iike a banner....

612
00:39:58,259 --> 00:40:02,127
There's this whoIe idea,
''You Ieave me aIone, I Ieave you aIone.''

613
00:40:02,197 --> 00:40:05,598
It's even in some of the western Iiterature.
''live and Iet Iive.''

614
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,294
That is such crap.
BasicaIIy, what it boiIs down to...

615
00:40:10,372 --> 00:40:14,468
...if I don't teII you I'm a fag,
you won't beat the crap out of me.

616
00:40:15,043 --> 00:40:16,670
What's so great about that?

617
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:19,442
That's a great phiIosophy?

618
00:40:19,981 --> 00:40:22,814
I'll sit in church and the reverend
will tell you flat out...

619
00:40:22,884 --> 00:40:25,352
...he does not agree
with homosexuality, right?

620
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,082
I don't feeI Iike I know enough
about certain things...

621
00:40:28,156 --> 00:40:30,989
...just to be abIe to say
that homosexuaIity is right...

622
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:34,756
...when I've been raised my whoIe Iife
that homosexuaIity is wrong.

623
00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:37,354
My parents brought me up CathoIic.

624
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,160
I was brought up
to Iove the sinner, hate the sin.

625
00:40:41,836 --> 00:40:44,327
love the person for who they are,
but condemn them...

626
00:40:44,406 --> 00:40:46,840
...for what they do. Condemn the IifestyIe.

627
00:40:46,908 --> 00:40:49,035
I wouId have to say now
I don't agree with it.

628
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:52,443
I don't agree, and maybe that's just
because I couIdn't do it...

629
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:55,411
...but I don't hate them,
I won't persecute them.

630
00:40:55,483 --> 00:40:58,884
I'm not gonna Iet this get in between
me and the other person at aII...

631
00:40:58,953 --> 00:41:00,614
...or in between you and I.

632
00:41:00,688 --> 00:41:02,280
Not at aII.

633
00:41:02,857 --> 00:41:06,190
It's preached in schooIs
that being gay is okay.

634
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:10,760
If my kids asked me,
I'd set them down and I'd teII them:

635
00:41:10,832 --> 00:41:13,027
''This is what gay peopIe do.''

636
00:41:13,435 --> 00:41:15,596
''This is what animaIs do, okay?''

637
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:20,198
I'd teII them, ''This is the Iife.
This is the IifestyIe. This is what they do.''

638
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:24,601
And I'd say,
''This is why I beIieve it's wrong.''

639
00:41:24,779 --> 00:41:27,543
Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame!

640
00:41:33,088 --> 00:41:37,320
In New YorK, the protests for
Matthew Shepard turned into a near riot.

641
00:41:37,392 --> 00:41:40,156
PoIice on horses were pushing
into the crowds.

642
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:52,569
The whoIe worId is watching!

643
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:03,547
As of (:00 a.m. today, Matthew Shepard
remains in criticaI condition...

644
00:42:03,618 --> 00:42:07,577
...with severe head injuries in the
surgicaI neuro intensive care unit.

645
00:42:09,491 --> 00:42:13,757
As I toId you before,
it's not a IifestyIe with which I agree.

646
00:42:14,462 --> 00:42:15,986
You stiII feeI that way?

647
00:42:16,831 --> 00:42:17,855
Yes.

648
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,262
The famiIy continues to emphasize...

649
00:42:21,803 --> 00:42:24,465
...that the media respect their privacy.

650
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:27,838
The famiIy aIso wants to thank
the American pubIic...

651
00:42:27,976 --> 00:42:31,844
...for their concern
and kind thoughts for Matthew.

652
00:42:31,913 --> 00:42:34,040
We went to the candle vigil and...

653
00:42:34,315 --> 00:42:37,614
...it was so good to be with people
who felt liKe shit.

654
00:42:37,952 --> 00:42:41,285
I Kept feeling liKe
I don't deserve to feel this bad.

655
00:42:41,823 --> 00:42:43,620
Somebody got up and said, ''Come on...

656
00:42:43,691 --> 00:42:47,092
''...Iet's show the worId that laramie
is not this kind of a town.''

657
00:42:47,162 --> 00:42:49,130
But it is this kind of a town.

658
00:42:49,931 --> 00:42:52,297
If it wasn't, then why did this happen here?

659
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:55,495
I mean, that's a lie,
because it happened here.

660
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:58,835
So how could it not be a town
where this Kind of thing happens?

661
00:42:58,907 --> 00:43:00,772
How can you even say that?

662
00:43:01,142 --> 00:43:05,738
We have to mourn this, and
we have to be sad, but we Iive in a town...

663
00:43:06,314 --> 00:43:09,647
...a state, a country
where shit Iike this happens.

664
00:43:10,051 --> 00:43:12,884
PeopIe are trying to distance
themseIves from this crime...

665
00:43:12,954 --> 00:43:16,788
...and we need to own this crime, I feeI.
Everyone needs to own it.

666
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:19,149
We are Iike this.

667
00:43:20,261 --> 00:43:23,788
We are Iike this. We are Iike this.

668
00:43:24,699 --> 00:43:28,032
Not having to deaI that much with
the gay community here in laramie...

669
00:43:28,102 --> 00:43:31,230
...once we started working
into the case and actuaIIy...

670
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:35,871
...taIking to peopIe that were gay, reaIizing
what their underIying fears were...

671
00:43:36,244 --> 00:43:38,576
...that's when it sort of hit home.

672
00:43:39,447 --> 00:43:40,971
This is America.

673
00:43:41,249 --> 00:43:43,410
You don't have the right to feeI that fear.

674
00:43:43,484 --> 00:43:46,146
Do you think a Iot of peopIe
in laramie feeI the same way?

675
00:43:46,221 --> 00:43:49,588
We're aIways gonna have peopIe
that hoId up the oId ideaIs...

676
00:43:49,824 --> 00:43:52,486
...and I was probabIy one of them
14 months ago.

677
00:43:52,994 --> 00:43:55,929
But I'm not gonna put up with it anymore
or Iisten to it.

678
00:43:55,997 --> 00:43:59,694
And if they don't Iike my views on it, fine.
The door goes both ways.

679
00:44:00,435 --> 00:44:03,802
I've aIready Iost a coupIe of buddies,
but I don't care.

680
00:44:05,473 --> 00:44:07,338
I feeI more comfortabIe...

681
00:44:08,042 --> 00:44:09,839
...and I can sIeep at night now.

682
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:15,447
-I really wanna thanK you for having us.
-Sure, it's our pleasure.

683
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,844
These gatherings,
this is a recent thing for us.

684
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:21,653
This reaIIy onIy happened since Matthew.

685
00:44:21,723 --> 00:44:24,055
And there's a reIief
in that we finaIIy connected.

686
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:26,958
It's nice to see
there are a Iot of us in laramie.

687
00:44:28,263 --> 00:44:30,197
Is everybody in the company gay?

688
00:44:30,265 --> 00:44:32,130
No, just the three of us.

689
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,259
-Are you out?
-Yes.

690
00:44:34,936 --> 00:44:37,598
I wasn't out before, actuaIIy.

691
00:44:37,705 --> 00:44:42,404
But I thought, ''ProbabIy they aII know,
but I'm not gonna teII anyone.''

692
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:45,907
In the Iong run,
your seIf-esteem just becomes shit...

693
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,742
...and I just couIdn't Iive Iike that anymore.

694
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:51,785
A Iot of peopIe decided that
they didn't wanna hide anymore.

695
00:44:51,853 --> 00:44:56,381
I stiII don't feeI that free to be out here.
No one's asking, I'm not teIIing.

696
00:44:56,624 --> 00:45:00,560
I've aIways been out and I know
how to take care of myseIf, but...

697
00:45:00,962 --> 00:45:03,726
...since the episode,
I've been irrationaIIy terrified...

698
00:45:03,798 --> 00:45:07,825
...and what that means is, we don't Iet
our son waIk around at night aIone.

699
00:45:07,902 --> 00:45:11,702
Every time I see a pickup truck do a U-turn,
I think it's coming after me...

700
00:45:11,773 --> 00:45:14,799
...and I'm shaking so badIy,
I have to stop what I'm doing.

701
00:45:14,876 --> 00:45:16,741
I think it's because...

702
00:45:16,844 --> 00:45:20,371
...somewhere inside,
we aII know it couId happen to us anytime.

703
00:45:30,062 --> 00:45:32,030
Since our Iast medicaI update...

704
00:45:32,131 --> 00:45:36,830
...Matthew Shepard has remained in
criticaI condition with severe head injuries.

705
00:45:36,902 --> 00:45:40,269
As of today,
the hospitaI wiII no Ionger offer...

706
00:45:40,339 --> 00:45:43,001
...medicaI updates on a scheduIed basis.

707
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:46,636
If Matthew's medicaI condition changes...

708
00:45:46,712 --> 00:45:49,112
...we wiII issue a new medicaI update...

709
00:45:49,181 --> 00:45:54,141
...and we wiII immediateIy contact as many
members of the media as is possibIe.

710
00:45:54,386 --> 00:45:55,648
Thank you.

711
00:45:58,724 --> 00:46:02,990
AII eyes are on laramie, Wyoming, today,
where many are turning their focus...

712
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:04,891
...to their homecoming parade...

713
00:46:04,964 --> 00:46:08,866
...and the fortunes of the University
of Wyoming footbaII team.

714
00:46:28,354 --> 00:46:31,721
This apartment has windows
on two opposite streets.

715
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:34,281
One goes north and the other goes south.

716
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,818
That is exactIy
the homecoming parade route.

717
00:46:40,065 --> 00:46:44,161
On the day of the parade,
I had a cast on my Ieg because of a faII...

718
00:46:44,236 --> 00:46:48,935
...and I was very disappointed because
I had heard that some students...

719
00:46:49,408 --> 00:46:52,241
...were gonna be waIking
for Matthew Shepard...

720
00:46:52,611 --> 00:46:56,843
...and I wanted to join them, but I couIdn't,
so I watched from that window.

721
00:46:57,082 --> 00:46:58,310
It was just....

722
00:46:59,718 --> 00:47:02,881
I'm 52 years oId and I'm....

723
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:05,220
I'm gay.

724
00:47:06,325 --> 00:47:10,421
I've Iived here for many years
and I've seen a Iot.

725
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:15,433
And I was very moved
when I saw the tag...

726
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:18,764
...at the end of the homecoming parade.

727
00:47:26,245 --> 00:47:30,682
It was just a group of people walKing
behind a banner for Matthew Shepard.

728
00:47:39,658 --> 00:47:43,754
But the parade,
it went down to the end of the bIock...

729
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:46,156
...made a U-turn around the bIock...

730
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:48,529
...and I came to the other side
of my apartment...

731
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,125
...to watch for it to come south
down this street.

732
00:47:53,005 --> 00:47:55,906
Maybe 10 minutes went by.

733
00:47:59,845 --> 00:48:02,541
And then I saw the most...

734
00:48:03,282 --> 00:48:05,113
...incredibIe thing.

735
00:48:08,354 --> 00:48:10,288
As the parade came down the street...

736
00:48:10,356 --> 00:48:13,382
...the number of people marching
for Matthew Shepard...

737
00:48:13,459 --> 00:48:16,360
...had grown, liKe, five times.

738
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:18,853
Can you imagine?

739
00:48:19,331 --> 00:48:21,094
The tag at the end...

740
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:24,192
...was bigger than the entire parade.

741
00:48:36,682 --> 00:48:38,377
I thought to myseIf:

742
00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:42,685
''Thank God I got to see this
in my Iifetime.''

743
00:48:44,723 --> 00:48:46,816
And my second thought was:

744
00:48:48,827 --> 00:48:50,818
''Thank you, Matthew.''

745
00:49:00,606 --> 00:49:03,598
I really haven't been
all that involved, per se.

746
00:49:04,676 --> 00:49:09,340
My husband's a highway patroIman.
That's the onIy way I've known about it.

747
00:49:09,915 --> 00:49:12,213
But when I first found out...

748
00:49:12,351 --> 00:49:14,478
...I just thought it was horribIe.

749
00:49:15,754 --> 00:49:16,778
I just....

750
00:49:18,557 --> 00:49:19,888
I can't....

751
00:49:20,526 --> 00:49:22,289
Nobody deserves that.

752
00:49:24,096 --> 00:49:25,757
I don't care who you are.

753
00:49:26,398 --> 00:49:30,357
But I have to teII you,
the media's portraying him as a saint.

754
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:34,466
They're making him out as a martyr,
and I don't think he was.

755
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,400
Did you know him?

756
00:49:36,842 --> 00:49:39,174
No, I didn't know him...

757
00:49:39,478 --> 00:49:42,379
...but there's so many things...

758
00:49:42,448 --> 00:49:45,508
...I found about him, it's just scary.

759
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:50,313
About his character, and...

760
00:49:50,956 --> 00:49:54,084
...spreading AIDS, and a few other things.

761
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,291
You know, being....

762
00:49:56,962 --> 00:49:58,987
About the kind of person he was.

763
00:49:59,298 --> 00:50:00,492
Meaning?

764
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:03,461
WeII....

765
00:50:04,136 --> 00:50:05,569
He was....

766
00:50:06,271 --> 00:50:07,898
He was just...

767
00:50:10,676 --> 00:50:12,200
...a barfIy.

768
00:50:13,078 --> 00:50:15,012
So, I think he...

769
00:50:15,247 --> 00:50:19,809
...pushed himseIf on, around or,
I don't know. But I think he fIaunted it.

770
00:50:21,553 --> 00:50:23,384
Another thing that wasn't brought out.

771
00:50:23,455 --> 00:50:26,982
Same time that happened, that patroIman
was kiIIed and there was nothing.

772
00:50:27,326 --> 00:50:30,352
They didn't say anything
about that oId man that kiIIed him.

773
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:32,021
He was driving down the road.

774
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:34,292
He shouIdn't have been driving
and he kiIIed him.

775
00:50:34,366 --> 00:50:36,266
And there was just a IittIe piece.

776
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:39,294
And we Iost one of our guys.

777
00:50:40,105 --> 00:50:43,097
You know, my husband worked with him.

778
00:50:43,642 --> 00:50:46,202
This man was brand new on the force.

779
00:50:46,879 --> 00:50:49,245
But, I mean, here's one of ours...

780
00:50:49,882 --> 00:50:52,578
...and it was just a IittIe piece in the paper.

781
00:50:53,152 --> 00:50:56,315
But this was such a deIiberate crime.

782
00:50:59,558 --> 00:51:01,321
Everybody's got probIems.

783
00:51:03,128 --> 00:51:06,689
But why they're exempIifying
Matthew Shepard, I don't know.

784
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:11,263
A hate crime is a hate crime.
You murder somebody, you hate them.

785
00:51:11,336 --> 00:51:15,670
It has nothing to do if you're a gay
or a prostitute or....

786
00:51:15,874 --> 00:51:17,205
I don't know.

787
00:51:21,046 --> 00:51:22,536
I don't understand.

788
00:51:25,918 --> 00:51:27,317
I don't understand.

789
00:51:36,628 --> 00:51:41,429
November 29, 1998. We're about
to interview Father Roger Schmit.

790
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:45,092
Here we go.
Two queers and a Catholic priest.

791
00:51:46,438 --> 00:51:48,099
Matthew Shepard...

792
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:51,073
...has served us weII.

793
00:51:52,644 --> 00:51:55,169
You reaIize that? He has served us weII.

794
00:51:55,948 --> 00:51:57,745
I cannot mention anyone...

795
00:51:57,816 --> 00:52:01,217
...who has done more for this community
than Matthew Shepard.

796
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:07,281
And I'm not gonna sit here and say,
''I was just this boId guy, no fear.''

797
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:09,556
I was scared.

798
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:13,492
I was very vocaI in this community
when this happened...

799
00:52:13,565 --> 00:52:17,194
...so I thought,
''ShouId we caII the Bishop...

800
00:52:17,669 --> 00:52:20,638
''...and ask him permission to do the vigiI?''

801
00:52:20,739 --> 00:52:22,070
And I was Iike:

802
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:26,538
''HeII, no, I'm not going to do that.

803
00:52:26,612 --> 00:52:29,581
''His permission doesn't make it correct.''

804
00:52:29,781 --> 00:52:31,578
And I'm not knocking bishops...

805
00:52:31,984 --> 00:52:34,714
...but what is correct is correct.

806
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,404
You think vioIence is
what they did to Matthew?

807
00:52:40,038 --> 00:52:42,404
They did do vioIence to Matthew.

808
00:52:42,908 --> 00:52:44,307
But, you know....

809
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:47,269
Can I make this personaI?

810
00:52:47,379 --> 00:52:48,869
Yeah. Sure.

811
00:52:49,248 --> 00:52:53,116
Every time you are caIIed a fag...

812
00:52:54,086 --> 00:52:57,317
...or you are caIIed a Iez or....

813
00:52:57,389 --> 00:53:00,620
-Or a dyke.
-Dyke, yeah, dyke.

814
00:53:01,393 --> 00:53:05,454
Do you reaIize that is vioIence?
That is the seed of vioIence.

815
00:53:05,531 --> 00:53:10,491
I wouId resent it immenseIy
if you use anything I said to...

816
00:53:10,969 --> 00:53:14,268
...somehow cuItivate that kind of vioIence.

817
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,468
WeII, thank you, Father, for saying that.

818
00:53:17,543 --> 00:53:20,444
Just deaI with what is true.

819
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:23,275
You know what is true.

820
00:53:25,717 --> 00:53:29,278
You need to do your best to say it correct.

821
00:53:31,657 --> 00:53:35,115
These peopIe trust us, you know.
They want....

822
00:53:36,094 --> 00:53:39,621
They want everyone to know
that they are not this crime.

823
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:47,900
And it's more than cIearing laramie's
name, it's cIearing their own, and...

824
00:53:48,574 --> 00:53:50,701
...I don't know that we can do that.

825
00:53:59,284 --> 00:54:00,410
Reverend?

826
00:54:00,485 --> 00:54:02,009
-Reverend, hi.
-Yes?

827
00:54:02,087 --> 00:54:04,214
I'm Amanda.
I'm with the theatre company...

828
00:54:04,289 --> 00:54:06,655
...that's been speaking with peopIe
here in laramie.

829
00:54:06,725 --> 00:54:10,024
I see. WeII, Iet me teII you...

830
00:54:11,096 --> 00:54:15,624
...I don't know that I reaIIy want to taIk
with anybody at aII about this incident.

831
00:54:15,701 --> 00:54:20,263
I'm somewhat invoIved,
and I reaIIy don't feeI Iike it's appropriate.

832
00:54:20,505 --> 00:54:24,498
I compIeteIy understand. I just wanted
to teII you, I went to your service.

833
00:54:24,576 --> 00:54:26,441
-You went to the services?
-Yes, I did.

834
00:54:26,511 --> 00:54:28,103
-On Sunday?
-Yes.

835
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,375
-Did I meet you?
-BriefIy.

836
00:54:30,649 --> 00:54:32,344
You weIcomed us in the beginning.

837
00:54:33,085 --> 00:54:34,347
I see.

838
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,346
I wiII teII you that I am invoIved.

839
00:54:39,057 --> 00:54:40,854
HaIf the peopIe in the case....

840
00:54:40,959 --> 00:54:44,759
The girIfriend of the accused
is a member of our congregation...

841
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:46,798
...and one of the accused has visited.

842
00:54:46,999 --> 00:54:48,057
Right.

843
00:54:48,133 --> 00:54:50,328
I think they deserve the death penaIty...

844
00:54:50,402 --> 00:54:54,338
...but I wiII try
to deaI with them spirituaIIy.

845
00:54:55,874 --> 00:54:57,774
As far as the victim...

846
00:54:59,711 --> 00:55:04,273
...I know that that IifestyIe is IegaI,
but I wiII teII you one thing.

847
00:55:04,349 --> 00:55:06,874
I hope Matthew Shepard...

848
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,284
...as he was tied to that fence...

849
00:55:10,856 --> 00:55:14,849
...that he had time to refIect
on a moment when...

850
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,524
...somebody had spoken
the Word of the lord to him...

851
00:55:20,999 --> 00:55:24,025
...and that before he sIipped into a coma...

852
00:55:24,269 --> 00:55:28,365
...he had a chance to refIect on his IifestyIe.

853
00:55:33,979 --> 00:55:37,346
Thank you, Reverend,
I appreciate your speaking with me.

854
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:39,611
AII right. We better go.

855
00:55:49,561 --> 00:55:52,621
I Iet him say that to me.

856
00:55:52,764 --> 00:55:56,291
I Iet him say that to me,
and I didn't say anything back.

857
00:56:22,627 --> 00:56:26,654
At midnight, on Monday, October 12...

858
00:56:27,132 --> 00:56:30,829
...Matthew Shepard's bIood pressure
began to drop.

859
00:56:31,303 --> 00:56:36,263
We immediateIy notified the famiIy,
who were aIready at the hospitaI.

860
00:56:38,310 --> 00:56:40,608
At 12:53 a.m...

861
00:56:41,113 --> 00:56:43,081
...Matthew Shepard died.

862
00:56:45,183 --> 00:56:47,481
His famiIy was at his bedside.

863
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,717
The famiIy did reIease
the foIIowing statement.

864
00:56:52,324 --> 00:56:57,023
They again asked me to express
their sincerest gratitude...

865
00:56:58,096 --> 00:56:59,688
...to the entire worId...

866
00:56:59,765 --> 00:57:03,633
...for the overwheIming response
to their son.

867
00:57:05,103 --> 00:57:09,062
The famiIy was gratefuI
that they did not have to...

868
00:57:09,141 --> 00:57:14,044
...make a decision regarding whether or
not to continue Iife support for their son.

869
00:57:15,347 --> 00:57:19,249
''like a good son,
he was caring to the end...

870
00:57:19,484 --> 00:57:22,351
''...and removed guiIt or stress
from the famiIy.

871
00:57:23,789 --> 00:57:26,155
''He came into the worId premature...

872
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:28,926
''...and Ieft the worId premature.

873
00:57:30,395 --> 00:57:32,454
''Matthew's mother said:

874
00:57:35,734 --> 00:57:36,962
'''Go....'''

875
00:57:47,813 --> 00:57:51,180
We'd been up for 72 hours straight...

876
00:57:51,249 --> 00:57:54,218
...and had gone home
and gone to sleep for half an hour...

877
00:57:54,286 --> 00:57:57,949
...and get up and come,
maybe I was just way....

878
00:57:58,323 --> 00:57:59,585
I don't Know.

879
00:58:00,659 --> 00:58:04,993
WhiIe I was reading that statement,
I thought about my own four daughters.

880
00:58:05,497 --> 00:58:08,022
She doesn't have her Kid anymore.

881
00:58:11,102 --> 00:58:12,467
'''Go home...

882
00:58:13,772 --> 00:58:15,603
''' ...give your kids a hug...

883
00:58:19,811 --> 00:58:23,907
'''...and don't Iet a day go by
without teIIing them that you Iove them.'''

884
00:58:25,784 --> 00:58:30,687
And then we started getting people
sending us all these E-mails and letters.

885
00:58:30,822 --> 00:58:35,691
''Do you cry Iike a baby on TV
for aII your patients, or just the faggots?''

886
00:58:36,862 --> 00:58:38,124
Jesus.

887
00:58:39,064 --> 00:58:41,862
After being thrown into this...

888
00:58:41,933 --> 00:58:46,597
...I guess I didn't understand the magnitude
with which some peopIe hate.

889
00:58:48,139 --> 00:58:51,734
And of aII the Ietters we got,
there were two or three Iike that.

890
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:53,869
Most were:

891
00:58:53,979 --> 00:58:58,313
''Thanks for your caring and compassion.''

892
00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:00,174
And Matthew....

893
00:59:03,355 --> 00:59:06,722
Matthew got caring and compassion...

894
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:09,191
...from the moment he got here.

895
00:59:16,801 --> 00:59:20,202
The charges against Russell Henderson
and Aaron McKinney...

896
00:59:20,272 --> 00:59:25,073
...were upgraded to first-degree murder
after Matthew Shepard died on Monday.

897
00:59:25,143 --> 00:59:29,011
If convicted,
the two men could face the death penalty.

898
00:59:30,115 --> 00:59:31,582
I'II teII you what.

899
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:33,941
If they put those two boys to death...

900
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:37,386
...it wouId defeat everything
that Matt wouId be thinking about them.

901
00:59:37,455 --> 00:59:40,015
Because he wouId not want
those two to die.

902
00:59:40,091 --> 00:59:43,652
He'd wanna Ieave them with hope.
H-O-P-E.

903
00:59:43,862 --> 00:59:46,660
Just Iike the whoIe worId hoped...

904
00:59:46,731 --> 00:59:48,562
...that Matt wouId survive, right?

905
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,811
This whoIe thing, you see what I'm saying,
this whoIe thing ropes around hope.

906
00:59:49,811 --> 00:59:52,939
This whoIe thing, you see what I'm saying,
this whoIe thing ropes around hope.

907
00:59:53,015 --> 00:59:54,949
H-O-P-E.

908
01:00:10,232 --> 01:00:14,134
On the day of the funeral,
it was snowing and raining so bad.

909
01:00:14,202 --> 01:00:17,296
By the time I got there,
there were already thousands of people.

910
01:00:17,372 --> 01:00:19,772
Dressed in blacK. Umbrellas everywhere.

911
01:00:20,108 --> 01:00:24,272
They had two churches set up and still
there were hundreds of people outside...

912
01:00:24,346 --> 01:00:25,973
...who couldn't fit inside.

913
01:00:26,048 --> 01:00:29,381
They had this parK set up,
and the parK was full.

914
01:00:36,525 --> 01:00:40,621
''Thou shaIt not Iie down
with mankind as with womankind.

915
01:00:40,696 --> 01:00:45,656
''It is abomination.'' Matthew Shepard
Iived his Iife breaking that commandment!

916
01:00:45,834 --> 01:00:49,099
If he repented in his dying hours,
we hope he did, if not...

917
01:00:49,171 --> 01:00:53,039
...he is in HeII aIong with those kiIIers.
Do you beIieve in the BibIe?

918
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:56,339
You beIieve you're supposed to
separate the precious from the viIe?

919
01:00:56,411 --> 01:01:00,575
You don't beIieve that part of the BibIe.
You stand there, ignorant of the fact....

920
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:11,355
After seeing Phelps
protesting at Matthew's funeral...

921
01:01:11,426 --> 01:01:15,556
...and then hearing that he's coming back
to laramie for RusseII Henderson's triaI...

922
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:19,396
...I decided that someone needs to stand
toe-to-toe and show the difference.

923
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:23,097
Some peopIe are gonna be sent to HeII!

924
01:01:23,405 --> 01:01:25,805
And I think you know who you are!

925
01:01:26,942 --> 01:01:31,902
Nobody wouIdn't be here if this was just
a murder that the state was gonna handIe.

926
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,006
The state handIes hundreds of murders.

927
01:01:35,083 --> 01:01:39,349
This murder is different
because the gays....

928
01:01:39,421 --> 01:01:41,252
He's not even from Laramie.

929
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:45,054
He just travels around the country
doing these demonstrations.

930
01:01:51,433 --> 01:01:55,893
So we're pIanning an event.
We're caIIing it ''AngeI Action.''

931
01:01:56,505 --> 01:02:00,032
This 21-year-oId IittIe Iesbian
is gonna waIk the Iine with him.

932
01:02:03,378 --> 01:02:04,845
Fear not!

933
01:02:05,047 --> 01:02:07,982
You Iift up your voice Iike a trumpet...

934
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:13,110
...and you show my peopIe
their transgressions!

935
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:15,520
We are sending the message of God!

936
01:02:15,757 --> 01:02:17,918
God's anger is pure.

937
01:02:17,993 --> 01:02:21,656
And God is gonna send someone to HeII!

938
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:24,562
That's God's anger!

939
01:02:25,133 --> 01:02:27,328
Now, we wouIdn't be here....

940
01:02:40,282 --> 01:02:45,185
Do you want your sons and daughters
to be taught by faggots...

941
01:02:45,253 --> 01:02:46,982
...in your schooIs?

942
01:02:47,055 --> 01:02:48,886
We're not gonna Iet that happen!

943
01:03:11,012 --> 01:03:13,378
As soon as they started jury selection...

944
01:03:13,448 --> 01:03:15,814
...everyone was coming into my shop with:

945
01:03:15,884 --> 01:03:19,615
''I don't wanna be on this triaI.
I hope they don't caII me,'' or:

946
01:03:19,955 --> 01:03:22,856
''Oh, my God, I got caIIed.
How do I get off?''

947
01:03:23,191 --> 01:03:27,150
Just wanting to get as far away
from it as they could.

948
01:03:27,496 --> 01:03:31,830
Very fearful that they were
gonna have to be part of that jury.

949
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:37,261
Then I heard
Henderson had to sit in the courtroom...

950
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,366
...while they questioned prospective jurors.

951
01:03:41,009 --> 01:03:43,409
And one of the questions they asKed was:

952
01:03:43,478 --> 01:03:45,946
''Would you be willing...

953
01:03:46,014 --> 01:03:48,574
''...to put this person to death?''

954
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:52,085
And I understand a lot
of the comments were:

955
01:03:52,721 --> 01:03:54,211
''Yes, I would.''

956
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,147
''Absolutely.''

957
01:03:56,858 --> 01:03:58,519
''Yep, no problem.''

958
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:02,589
Can you imagine hearing that?

959
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:06,161
Juror after juror...

960
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:08,364
...after juror.

961
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:13,600
These are people that he Knows.

962
01:04:16,178 --> 01:04:18,544
No wonder he changed his pIea.

963
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,040
You entered a not guiIty pIea earIier,
Mr. Henderson.

964
01:04:22,384 --> 01:04:25,114
But I understand you wish to change
your pIea today?

965
01:04:25,187 --> 01:04:26,381
Yes, sir.

966
01:04:26,454 --> 01:04:31,084
Do you understand that the recommended
sentence here is two Iife sentences?

967
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:33,821
Yes, sir.

968
01:04:33,895 --> 01:04:38,855
And do you understand that those may
run concurrentIy or consecutiveIy?

969
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:41,526
Yes, sir.

970
01:04:41,603 --> 01:04:43,400
Before the court makes that decision...

971
01:04:43,471 --> 01:04:47,703
...I understand that there are statements
to be made by at Ieast one individuaI.

972
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:49,571
let's proceed with that.

973
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,473
As the grandmother
and the person who raised Russell...

974
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:58,744
...along with my family...

975
01:04:59,321 --> 01:05:01,551
...we have written the foIIowing statement.

976
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:07,484
''Our hearts ache for the pain and suffering
that the Shepards have went through.

977
01:05:08,063 --> 01:05:11,726
''We have prayed for your famiIy
since the very beginning.

978
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:16,203
''Many times throughout the day,
I have thought about Matt.

979
01:05:16,571 --> 01:05:19,836
''You wiII continue to be in our thoughts
and prayers...

980
01:05:19,908 --> 01:05:23,275
''...as we know that your pain
wiII never go away.

981
01:05:23,812 --> 01:05:26,940
''You have showed such mercy
and we are so gratefuI...

982
01:05:27,015 --> 01:05:30,416
''...that you are giving us
aII the opportunity to Iive.

983
01:05:31,586 --> 01:05:32,917
''Your Honor...

984
01:05:32,988 --> 01:05:35,752
''...we, as a famiIy...

985
01:05:36,157 --> 01:05:39,058
''...hope that as you sentence RusseII...

986
01:05:39,694 --> 01:05:42,424
''...that you wiII do it concurrentIy...

987
01:05:42,764 --> 01:05:44,857
''...for two Iife terms.

988
01:05:46,768 --> 01:05:49,202
''For the RusseII we know and Iove...

989
01:05:49,638 --> 01:05:52,664
''...we humbIy pIead, Your Honor...

990
01:05:53,475 --> 01:05:57,411
''...to not take RusseII
compIeteIy out of our Iives...

991
01:05:57,479 --> 01:05:58,844
''...forever.''

992
01:06:04,519 --> 01:06:06,282
Mr. and Mrs. Shepard...

993
01:06:06,354 --> 01:06:09,812
...there is not a moment
that goes by that I don't...

994
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,359
...see what happened that night.

995
01:06:13,728 --> 01:06:16,094
I know what I did was very wrong...

996
01:06:17,565 --> 01:06:19,795
...and I regret greatIy what I did.

997
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:24,094
You have my greatest sympathies
for what happened.

998
01:06:27,142 --> 01:06:28,336
I hope that...

999
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:33,103
...one day, you wiII be abIe to find it
in your hearts to forgive me.

1000
01:06:38,753 --> 01:06:40,345
Mr. Henderson...

1001
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:44,524
...this court does not beIieve that you
reaIIy feeI any true remorse...

1002
01:06:44,592 --> 01:06:46,321
...for your part in this matter.

1003
01:06:47,028 --> 01:06:51,055
And I wonder whether you fuIIy reaIize
the gravity of what you have done.

1004
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:55,501
You drove the vehicIe that took
Matthew Shepard to his death.

1005
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,704
You bound him to that fence...

1006
01:06:58,773 --> 01:07:02,004
...in order that he might be
more savageIy beaten...

1007
01:07:02,277 --> 01:07:05,838
...and in order that he might not escape
to teII his taIe.

1008
01:07:06,448 --> 01:07:09,474
You Ieft him out there for 18 hours...

1009
01:07:09,517 --> 01:07:10,719
...perhaps having an opportunity
to save his Iife...

1010
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,983
...perhaps having an opportunity
to save his Iife...

1011
01:07:13,055 --> 01:07:15,523
...and you did nothing.

1012
01:07:16,625 --> 01:07:20,527
As to count three,
that being feIony murder with robbery...

1013
01:07:21,197 --> 01:07:25,531
...you wiII serve a period of imprisonment
for the term of your naturaI Iife.

1014
01:07:26,035 --> 01:07:27,627
For count one...

1015
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:29,632
...kidnapping...

1016
01:07:30,105 --> 01:07:34,633
...you wiII serve a period of imprisonment
for the term of your naturaI Iife.

1017
01:07:35,578 --> 01:07:40,345
Sentencing for count one to run
consecutive to sentencing for count three.

1018
01:07:51,927 --> 01:07:56,057
After the sentencing, the Mormon Church
decided to excommunicate Russell.

1019
01:07:56,699 --> 01:08:00,465
He's got a Mormon home teacher
that visits him in prison every week.

1020
01:08:00,703 --> 01:08:03,001
Nobody from the church
is gonna go visit him?

1021
01:08:03,072 --> 01:08:05,700
Not supposed to.
They're not supposed to pray for him.

1022
01:08:05,774 --> 01:08:07,674
He'II just sort of disappear.

1023
01:08:25,527 --> 01:08:28,360
What happened that night?

1024
01:08:29,665 --> 01:08:31,565
We need to know.

1025
01:08:33,135 --> 01:08:35,660
This town needs to Know.

1026
01:08:43,412 --> 01:08:45,380
I need some more Iight on them.

1027
01:08:46,649 --> 01:08:50,380
-I never get tired of this pIay.
-Try directing it 50 times.

1028
01:08:50,452 --> 01:08:53,250
You can reIax, just keep the umbreIIas up.

1029
01:08:54,156 --> 01:08:57,250
I hear you're doing
Angels in America next year.

1030
01:08:57,326 --> 01:09:00,056
We have an obIigation
to reach our students...

1031
01:09:00,129 --> 01:09:02,825
...and the question is, how do you move....

1032
01:09:03,232 --> 01:09:05,496
How do you reach a whoIe state...

1033
01:09:05,567 --> 01:09:08,195
...where there is such
deep-seated hostiIity toward gays?

1034
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:09,999
How do you reach them?

1035
01:09:10,072 --> 01:09:13,007
Angels in America is just the beginning.

1036
01:09:13,442 --> 01:09:15,774
And guess who's auditioning for the Iead?

1037
01:09:16,211 --> 01:09:18,475
My parents, right, they're Iike:

1038
01:09:18,547 --> 01:09:21,710
''So what pIays are they doing
in schooI this year?''

1039
01:09:21,784 --> 01:09:24,947
''let's see, Angels in America.''

1040
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:26,351
''Wait.

1041
01:09:27,022 --> 01:09:30,651
''Angels in America? Isn't that that pIay?

1042
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,291
''It's that scene?

1043
01:09:33,028 --> 01:09:36,464
''So you're gonna audition for this?''

1044
01:09:36,765 --> 01:09:37,993
And I said:

1045
01:09:39,034 --> 01:09:40,865
''Yeah, I am.''

1046
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:43,433
Huge argument, right?

1047
01:09:43,505 --> 01:09:45,666
It was this huge argument,
and my mom says:

1048
01:09:45,741 --> 01:09:49,802
''You know, homosexuaIity is a sin.
HomosexuaIity is a sin.''

1049
01:09:49,878 --> 01:09:52,472
But the best thing
that I knew I had on them...

1050
01:09:52,581 --> 01:09:54,549
...was that they had just seen me...

1051
01:09:54,616 --> 01:09:57,813
...right before this, onstage in Macbeth.

1052
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:02,516
I murdered this IittIe kid and lady MacDuff
and these two other guys, right?

1053
01:10:02,591 --> 01:10:04,252
I'm Iike, ''Mom....

1054
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:08,057
''I just pIayed a murderer tonight,
and you...

1055
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:10,890
''...didn't seem to have
any probIem with that.''

1056
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:14,799
-So when's the audition?
-Tuesday.

1057
01:10:15,037 --> 01:10:19,974
I have never prepared myseIf
for an audition Iike this in my Iife.

1058
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:21,574
Not even cIose.

1059
01:10:22,578 --> 01:10:26,241
Everybody second-guesses
what you're doing.

1060
01:10:26,915 --> 01:10:29,281
You get a Iot of heavy criticism.

1061
01:10:29,852 --> 01:10:31,581
You did everything wrong.

1062
01:10:31,754 --> 01:10:35,815
You're not supposed to touch anybody
without gIoves and protective gear.

1063
01:10:38,427 --> 01:10:42,295
Then they make you out
to be some kind of big hero.

1064
01:10:43,766 --> 01:10:48,703
Some Joe BIow down the bIock,
he couId have done a better job than I did.

1065
01:10:52,007 --> 01:10:54,441
PeopIe do extraordinary things every day.

1066
01:10:56,345 --> 01:10:59,940
I think this has reaIIy brought home
to my girIs...

1067
01:11:00,315 --> 01:11:02,647
...what their mom does for a Iiving.

1068
01:11:08,757 --> 01:11:10,224
Just a minute.

1069
01:11:10,292 --> 01:11:12,783
It's the decision of the
County's Attorney's Office...

1070
01:11:12,861 --> 01:11:15,625
...that this wiII be tried
as a death penaIty case.

1071
01:11:15,697 --> 01:11:17,961
That's aII I have for you now. Thank you.

1072
01:11:18,634 --> 01:11:21,330
How can I protest
if the Shepards want McKinney dead?

1073
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:23,234
I just can't interfere in that.

1074
01:11:23,305 --> 01:11:26,502
But on a personaI IeveI,
I knew Aaron in grade schooI.

1075
01:11:26,575 --> 01:11:29,169
He wasn't caIIed Aaron. We caIIed him A.J.

1076
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:32,372
How can we put A.J. McKinney to death?

1077
01:11:32,948 --> 01:11:35,940
I think right now
our most important teachers...

1078
01:11:36,018 --> 01:11:38,782
...must be RusseII Henderson
and Aaron McKinney.

1079
01:11:38,854 --> 01:11:40,446
They have to be our teachers.

1080
01:11:40,522 --> 01:11:41,819
How did you Iearn?

1081
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:45,018
What did we do as a society
to teach you that?

1082
01:11:45,094 --> 01:11:48,325
I don't know if many peopIe
wiII Iet them be their teacher.

1083
01:11:48,397 --> 01:11:51,730
I think it wouId be wonderfuI
if the judge said:

1084
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,665
''In addition to the sentence...

1085
01:11:53,769 --> 01:11:56,397
''...you must teII your story.

1086
01:11:56,472 --> 01:11:59,600
''You must teII your story.''

1087
01:11:59,942 --> 01:12:03,469
This is a tape recording of the confession
given by Aaron James McKinney...

1088
01:12:03,545 --> 01:12:06,378
...to me as detective in charge
of the investigation.

1089
01:12:06,715 --> 01:12:10,014
This confession was recorded
two days after the attack.

1090
01:12:14,256 --> 01:12:18,693
-So, you guys go to the Fireside, right?
-Yeah.

1091
01:12:19,461 --> 01:12:21,986
Where do you go after you leave
the Fireside?

1092
01:12:22,397 --> 01:12:24,558
Some Kid wanted a ride home.

1093
01:12:25,901 --> 01:12:27,368
What's he Iook Iike?

1094
01:12:28,337 --> 01:12:29,895
like a queer.

1095
01:12:31,707 --> 01:12:35,006
-He Iooks Iike a queer?
-Yeah, Iike a fag, you know?

1096
01:12:36,378 --> 01:12:38,505
Okay, so, how'd you meet him?

1097
01:12:38,947 --> 01:12:41,609
The fag? The queer guy?

1098
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:46,412
We were meeting at the bar. He asked us
what we were drinking and doing.

1099
01:12:46,755 --> 01:12:49,280
So what happened after you met him?

1100
01:12:50,025 --> 01:12:52,585
He wanted a ride home, and...

1101
01:12:53,095 --> 01:12:56,462
...I just thought, ''The dude's drunK,
let's just taKe him home.''

1102
01:12:56,532 --> 01:12:59,296
When did you and Russ talK about
jacKing him up?

1103
01:12:59,501 --> 01:13:03,494
-We Kinda talKed about it at the bar.
-Tell me what happened next.

1104
01:13:03,805 --> 01:13:05,739
Drove him out past Wal Mart.

1105
01:13:06,008 --> 01:13:10,377
We got over there
and he starts grabbing my Ieg and...

1106
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:13,079
...grabbing my genitaIs and...

1107
01:13:14,016 --> 01:13:18,612
...I was Iike, ''I'm not a fucking faggot.
If you touch me again, you're gonna get it.''

1108
01:13:19,221 --> 01:13:22,554
I don't know what the heII
he was trying to do...

1109
01:13:23,258 --> 01:13:25,624
...but I beat him up pretty bad.

1110
01:13:26,261 --> 01:13:28,058
I think I kiIIed him.

1111
01:13:29,231 --> 01:13:32,894
-What did you hit him with?
-I bIacked out.

1112
01:13:33,402 --> 01:13:38,032
My fist, my pistoI, the butt of the gun.

1113
01:13:39,508 --> 01:13:42,773
I wonder what happened to me.
I had a few beers and I don't know.

1114
01:13:42,844 --> 01:13:45,244
It's Iike I couId see what was going on.

1115
01:13:45,814 --> 01:13:47,748
It was Iike somebody eIse was doing it.

1116
01:13:47,816 --> 01:13:52,810
What was the first thing he said or did
that made you want to hit him?

1117
01:13:54,523 --> 01:13:56,957
He put his hand on my Ieg and...

1118
01:13:57,025 --> 01:13:59,585
...sIid his hand
Iike he was gonna grab my baIIs.

1119
01:14:00,629 --> 01:14:04,429
When that defense team argued that
McKinney did what he did...

1120
01:14:04,499 --> 01:14:07,093
...because Matthew made a pass at him...

1121
01:14:07,769 --> 01:14:09,828
...I just wanted to vomit...

1122
01:14:10,973 --> 01:14:12,235
...because that's Iike saying it's okay.

1123
01:14:12,274 --> 01:14:13,500
It was disgusting
and we were aII just disgusted.

1124
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:16,128
It was disgusting
and we were aII just disgusted.

1125
01:14:16,203 --> 01:14:20,037
It was just rude,
and that was Iess than integrous behavior.

1126
01:14:20,107 --> 01:14:23,133
We were aII just disgusted
by that quaIity of defense.

1127
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:27,476
It's Iike the Twinkie defense, when the guy
kiIIed Harvey MiIk and Moscone.

1128
01:14:27,848 --> 01:14:29,315
It's the same thing.

1129
01:14:29,383 --> 01:14:32,477
As much as a part of me didn't want
the defense saying that...

1130
01:14:32,553 --> 01:14:35,420
...it was a gay bashing or gay panic...

1131
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:39,084
...a part of me was reaIIy gratefuI.

1132
01:14:39,259 --> 01:14:42,751
Because I was reaIIy afraid that
in this triaI they were gonna try...

1133
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:45,822
...and say that it was a robbery,
or it was about drugs.

1134
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:49,164
So when they used gay panic
as the defense...

1135
01:14:49,436 --> 01:14:51,529
...I thought, ''This is good...

1136
01:14:51,605 --> 01:14:55,803
''...because if nothing eIse,
the truth is gonna come out.

1137
01:14:56,176 --> 01:14:59,043
''The truth is gonna be told.''

1138
01:14:59,146 --> 01:15:01,910
About how many times
did you hit him in the trucK...

1139
01:15:01,982 --> 01:15:04,280
...before you guys stopped
where you Ieft him?

1140
01:15:04,351 --> 01:15:06,842
I'd say I hit him two or three times.

1141
01:15:07,454 --> 01:15:10,821
ProbabIy three times with my fists
and six times with the pistoI.

1142
01:15:10,891 --> 01:15:12,449
Did he ask you to stop?

1143
01:15:12,693 --> 01:15:14,923
Yeah, he was getting
the shit kicked out of him.

1144
01:15:14,995 --> 01:15:16,428
What did he say?

1145
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:21,192
After he asked me to stop,
most aII he was doing was screaming.

1146
01:15:25,506 --> 01:15:28,634
Was Matthew conscious
whiIe RusseII was tying him to the fence?

1147
01:15:28,709 --> 01:15:29,801
Yeah.

1148
01:15:29,877 --> 01:15:33,210
I toId him, ''Turn around and don't Iook
at my Iicense pIate number''...

1149
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,044
...because I was scared
he wouId teII the poIice.

1150
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:39,010
And then I asked him
what my Iicense pIate said.

1151
01:15:39,086 --> 01:15:42,055
He read it and that's why I hit him
a few more times.

1152
01:15:42,122 --> 01:15:43,851
Just to be sure?

1153
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:47,890
My secret hope was that they were
from somewhere else...

1154
01:15:48,295 --> 01:15:50,957
...that then you can create this distance.

1155
01:15:51,331 --> 01:15:53,959
We don't grow chiIdren Iike that here.

1156
01:15:55,903 --> 01:15:58,804
It's pretty cIear we do grow chiIdren
Iike that here.

1157
01:15:59,273 --> 01:16:01,537
So obviousIy you don't Iike gay peopIe?

1158
01:16:02,643 --> 01:16:05,305
-No, I don't.
-WouId you say you hate them?

1159
01:16:07,214 --> 01:16:11,310
No, I reaIIy don't hate them,
but when they start...

1160
01:16:11,919 --> 01:16:14,285
...coming on to me,
I get pretty aggravated.

1161
01:16:14,354 --> 01:16:16,720
So you've been approached
by gay peopIe before?

1162
01:16:17,524 --> 01:16:19,048
No, not reaIIy.

1163
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:21,250
Did he threaten you?

1164
01:16:21,361 --> 01:16:23,352
-This gay dude?
-Yeah.

1165
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:24,419
No.

1166
01:16:24,965 --> 01:16:26,865
Can you answer me one thing?

1167
01:16:27,334 --> 01:16:29,894
Why did you guys take his shoes?

1168
01:16:30,904 --> 01:16:32,462
I don't know.

1169
01:16:35,476 --> 01:16:38,070
I'm never gonna get to see my son again?

1170
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:44,640
I don't know.

1171
01:16:49,056 --> 01:16:50,819
He's gonna die for sure?

1172
01:16:51,258 --> 01:16:54,659
There is no doubt that
Mr. Shepard is going to die.

1173
01:16:58,732 --> 01:17:01,223
So what are they gonna give me, 25 to Iife?

1174
01:17:01,835 --> 01:17:04,463
Or the death penaIty
and just get it over with?

1175
01:17:04,538 --> 01:17:05,732
That's not our job.

1176
01:17:06,874 --> 01:17:09,604
That's the job of the judge and the jury.

1177
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:20,349
The strange thing is, 20 minutes
before Matthew was brought in...

1178
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:24,618
...Aaron McKinney, one of the perpetrators,
was brought in by his girIfriend.

1179
01:17:24,758 --> 01:17:27,693
-Wait. McKinney was here?
-Yeah.

1180
01:17:27,761 --> 01:17:32,221
I guess he went back into town Iater
that same night and got in a fight.

1181
01:17:33,267 --> 01:17:37,033
And so there's Aaron
on one bed in my ER...

1182
01:17:37,104 --> 01:17:39,504
...and just a few beds down is Matthew.

1183
01:17:40,507 --> 01:17:44,534
Then two days later,
I found out the connection.

1184
01:17:45,245 --> 01:17:47,338
Has the jury reached a verdict?

1185
01:17:48,348 --> 01:17:50,009
We have, Your Honor.

1186
01:17:51,585 --> 01:17:53,212
I was very...

1187
01:17:54,221 --> 01:17:55,449
...strucK.

1188
01:17:56,123 --> 01:17:57,590
They were two kids.

1189
01:17:58,358 --> 01:18:02,419
They were both my patients,
but they were two kids.

1190
01:18:03,497 --> 01:18:07,695
I took care of both of them,
took care of both their bodies...

1191
01:18:10,437 --> 01:18:14,635
...and I feIt a great deaI of compassion
for both of them.

1192
01:18:15,876 --> 01:18:17,104
We, the jury...

1193
01:18:17,177 --> 01:18:21,238
...impaneIed and sworn to try
the above-entitIed cause...

1194
01:18:21,315 --> 01:18:24,409
...after having weII
and truIy tried the matter...

1195
01:18:24,484 --> 01:18:27,248
...unanimousIy find as foIIows:

1196
01:18:27,855 --> 01:18:30,119
As to the charge of kidnapping...

1197
01:18:30,190 --> 01:18:34,286
...we find the defendant,
Aaron James McKinney...

1198
01:18:35,095 --> 01:18:36,426
...guiIty.

1199
01:18:39,666 --> 01:18:42,100
As to the charge of feIony murder...

1200
01:18:42,169 --> 01:18:46,128
...we find the defendant,
Aaron James McKinney...

1201
01:18:46,807 --> 01:18:48,138
...guiIty.

1202
01:18:57,684 --> 01:19:01,484
The jury returns to the courthouse today
to start considering the punishment...

1203
01:19:01,555 --> 01:19:05,013
...a phase of the trial that will probably last
until next weeK.

1204
01:19:05,425 --> 01:19:08,952
I am worKing with McKinney,
counseling him.

1205
01:19:09,329 --> 01:19:12,696
I don't think he can conceptuaIize...

1206
01:19:12,766 --> 01:19:15,496
...the gravity of something
Iike capitaI punishment...

1207
01:19:15,569 --> 01:19:18,732
...but I'm going to be praying
Iike the dickens tonight...

1208
01:19:18,805 --> 01:19:21,330
...that we don't have to go through
this next phase.

1209
01:19:21,408 --> 01:19:25,970
I don't know if you beIieve in prayer,
but wouId you do this for me?

1210
01:19:26,446 --> 01:19:29,006
WouId you just say, from time to time:

1211
01:19:29,082 --> 01:19:32,142
''lord, I Iift him up to you.''

1212
01:19:32,819 --> 01:19:34,616
Just do that for me.

1213
01:19:35,656 --> 01:19:36,987
Of course, Father.

1214
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:41,787
The sentencing phase of McKinney's
triaI was to begin momentariIy.

1215
01:19:41,862 --> 01:19:44,854
However, now we're hearing
that Judy and Dennis Shepard...

1216
01:19:44,932 --> 01:19:49,164
...have been approached by the defense
team, who have pIed for their cIient's Iife.

1217
01:19:49,236 --> 01:19:52,228
We understand Mr. Shepard
may approach the court this morning.

1218
01:20:13,327 --> 01:20:14,954
''My son Matthew...

1219
01:20:15,696 --> 01:20:17,630
''...did not Iook Iike a winner.

1220
01:20:18,932 --> 01:20:20,900
''He was rather uncoordinated...

1221
01:20:20,968 --> 01:20:25,132
''...and wore braces from the age of 13
untiI the day he died.

1222
01:20:27,307 --> 01:20:31,038
''However, in his aII-too-brief Iife,
he proved that he was a winner.

1223
01:20:32,546 --> 01:20:35,276
''On October 6, 1((8...

1224
01:20:35,349 --> 01:20:38,546

''...50 days before his 22nd birthday.

1230
01:21:05,078 --> 01:21:09,276
''I keep wondering the same thing that
I did when I first saw him in the hospitaI.

1231
01:21:10,584 --> 01:21:12,575
''What wouId he have become?

1232
01:21:13,653 --> 01:21:17,316
''How couId he have changed
his piece of the worId to make it better?

1233
01:21:19,192 --> 01:21:23,060
''Matt officiaIIy died in a hospitaI
in Fort CoIIins, CoIorado.

1234
01:21:24,765 --> 01:21:27,825

of laramie...

1235

''There were his IifeIong friends with him...

01:21:48,918 --> 01:21:51,512
''...friends that he had grown up with.

1241
01:21:53,223 --> 01:21:56,158
''You're probabIy wondering
who these friends were.

1242
01:21:58,294 --> 01:22:02,094
''First, he had the beautifuI night sky
and the same stars and moon...

1243

you can see something besides a crime...

01:25:51,527 --> 01:25:53,859
...and understand why we Iove it so much.

1286
01:25:55,865 --> 01:25:59,858
I'm just reaIIy gIad that it's over.
You know, I reaIIy am.

1287
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:04,805
Testifying in this triaI has been one of
the hardest things I've had to do in my Iife.

1288
01:26:04,874 --> 01:26:08,469
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I Iove the stage, I'm a naturaI for it...

1289
01:26:08,544 --> 01:26:12,310
...but the actuaI testifying is reaIIy,
reaIIy difficuIt.

1290
01:26:12,382 --> 01:26:14,577
The Iawyers are asking you questions...

1291
01:26:14,651 --> 01:26:17,916
...so you have questions
that are coming at you in this avenue...

1292
01:26:17,987 --> 01:26:20,547
...but then you have to funneI them over
to the jury.

1293
01:26:20,623 --> 01:26:23,592
So you funneI them over there,
and what you end up with is....

1294
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:26,356
WeII, basicaIIy,
you have a funneIing system.

1295
01:26:26,429 --> 01:26:27,623
Right?

1296
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:35,032
After taking the ATZ for six months,
I was abIe to get a DNA test.

1297
01:26:35,104 --> 01:26:36,128
And it was...

1298
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:41,136
...about a week Iater,
I found out that I was...

1299
01:26:41,277 --> 01:26:42,835
...negative for good.

1300
01:26:42,912 --> 01:26:44,880
-Wow. Thank God.
-That's great.

1301
01:26:44,947 --> 01:26:48,474
I teII you, we were aII on our knees
saying HaiI Marys.

1302
01:26:48,551 --> 01:26:51,520
Yeah, you're just so eIated.
We were reaIIy happy.

1303
01:26:51,587 --> 01:26:53,418
So what's the first thing she does?

1304
01:26:53,489 --> 01:26:56,185
I stuck my tongue right
in my husband's mouth.

1305
01:26:57,260 --> 01:27:00,195
-What about your daughters?
-The girIs, they just bawIed.

1306
01:27:00,263 --> 01:27:02,163
They were just so happy.

1307
01:27:02,231 --> 01:27:04,256
-And the force....
-Boy.

1308
01:27:04,333 --> 01:27:07,359
Yeah, we went out and got shit-faced.

1309
01:27:07,437 --> 01:27:09,997
I just kissed everybody
who came through that door.

1310
01:27:10,106 --> 01:27:12,336
-They don't need to know that.
-You know what?

1311
01:27:12,408 --> 01:27:15,206
If it was a maIe or a femaIe,
I kissed them on the Iips.

1312
01:27:15,278 --> 01:27:17,906
What part of what I just said
did you not understand?

1313
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:19,971
Mom, I have aIready kissed them.

1314
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:34,027
It's not clear to me,
having Known Matthew...

1315
01:27:34,564 --> 01:27:37,465
...what story he would want
told about this.

1316
01:27:38,101 --> 01:27:40,501
We won't fuIIy understand
what happened here...

1317
01:27:40,570 --> 01:27:44,165
...untiI time has had a chance
to fiIter that out for us.

1318
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,835
What happened here,
the culture that caused this...

1319
01:27:47,910 --> 01:27:50,879
...the complex set of events
leading up to it...

1320
01:27:51,347 --> 01:27:54,680
...it wouId have been Iike
us trying to stop a tank.

1321
01:28:01,491 --> 01:28:06,394
Change is not an easy thing,
and I don't think peopIe were up to it.

1322
01:28:07,463 --> 01:28:08,930
They got what they wanted.

1323
01:28:08,998 --> 01:28:12,764
Those two boys got what they deserve,
and we Iook good now.

1324
01:28:13,102 --> 01:28:16,731
It's been over a year since
Matthew Shepard died...

1325
01:28:16,806 --> 01:28:20,242
...and they haven't passed shit in Wyoming.

1326
01:28:20,643 --> 01:28:22,975
They haven't passed it at a state IeveI...

1327
01:28:23,045 --> 01:28:25,741
...any town, anybody, anywhere...

1328
01:28:25,815 --> 01:28:28,511
...has passed any kind of Iaws.

1329
01:28:28,584 --> 01:28:32,247
Anti-discrimination Iaws
or hate crime IegisIation...

1330
01:28:32,321 --> 01:28:36,348
...nobody has passed anything anywhere.

1331
01:28:39,362 --> 01:28:41,840
What's come out of it?

1332
01:28:42,341 --> 01:28:46,243
What's come out of it
that's concrete and Iasting?

1333
01:28:47,546 --> 01:28:52,540
''The dead wiII be commemorated
and wiII struggIe on with the Iiving...

1334
01:28:53,319 --> 01:28:56,686
''...and we are not going away.

1335
01:28:58,257 --> 01:29:00,555
''We won't die secret deaths anymore.

1336
01:29:01,727 --> 01:29:04,059
''The worId onIy spins forward.

1337
01:29:06,732 --> 01:29:09,462
''We will be citizens.

1338
01:29:10,502 --> 01:29:12,163
''The time has come.

1339
01:29:22,715 --> 01:29:23,977
'''Bye, now.''

1340
01:29:32,191 --> 01:29:34,682
Have you ever gone out to the fence?

1341
01:29:37,096 --> 01:29:39,656
I drove up to the site in my limousine...

1342
01:29:40,065 --> 01:29:44,798
...and I remembered something to myself
the night he and I drove around together.

1343
01:29:44,870 --> 01:29:47,464
He said, ''laramie sparkIes, doesn't it?''

1344
01:29:49,174 --> 01:29:51,574
And where he was in that spot up there...

1345
01:29:51,677 --> 01:29:55,977
...if you sit exactIy in that spot up there,
laramie sparkIes from there.

1346
01:29:56,415 --> 01:29:58,679
With the Iow-Iying cIouds...

1347
01:29:59,018 --> 01:30:02,920
...it's the bIue Iights bouncing off
the cIouds from the airport...

1348
01:30:02,988 --> 01:30:05,616
...and it goes...

1349
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:09,691
...over the whoIe city.

1350
01:30:10,829 --> 01:30:12,228
I mean...

1351
01:30:13,332 --> 01:30:15,323
...it bIows you away.

1352
01:30:16,001 --> 01:30:20,495
Matt was right there in that spot,
and I can just picture...

1353
01:30:20,706 --> 01:30:22,230
...in his eyes....

1354
01:30:23,108 --> 01:30:25,906
I can picture what he was seeing.

1355
01:30:27,112 --> 01:30:30,639
The last thing that he saw on this earth...

1356
01:30:31,183 --> 01:30:35,210
...was the sparKling lights
of Laramie, Wyoming.
