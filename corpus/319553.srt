00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:06,423
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
WARNER BROS.

2
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,964
HA HA HA HA!

3
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:14,250
Helga: WHEN YOUR FATHER
WAS A BOY LIKE YOU

4
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,753
AND LIVING WITH ME
HERE IN NORWAY,

5
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:19,255
I TOLD HIM
ABOUT WITCHES, TOO,

6
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:22,258
SO THAT HE WOULD
ALWAYS BE AWARE.

7
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:24,260
NOW, THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING

8
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,264
YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT
REAL WITCHES IS THIS--

9
00:02:28,264 --> 00:02:29,766
NOW LISTEN
VERY CAREFULLY.

10
00:02:29,766 --> 00:02:33,269
REAL WITCHES DRESS
IN ORDINARY CLOTHES

11
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:36,272
AND LOOK VERY MUCH
LIKE ORDINARY WOMEN.

12
00:02:36,272 --> 00:02:38,775
THEY LIVE
IN ORDINARY HOUSES,

13
00:02:38,775 --> 00:02:42,779
AND THEY WORK
IN ORDINARY JOBS.

14
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:48,785
EVERY COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD HAS WITCHES.

15
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:51,788
AND THERE IS A LEADER,

16
00:02:51,788 --> 00:02:53,289
A HIGH WITCH,

17
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:54,791
OF EACH COUNTRY.

18
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:59,295
AND THE RULER
OF ALL THE WITCHES

19
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:03,299
IS THE MOST EVIL WOMAN
IN CREATION--

20
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,803
THE GRAND HIGH WITCH...

21
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:08,304
HERSELF.

22
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:15,311
WITCHES SPEND
THEIR TIME

23
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:17,313
PLOTTING
TO KILL CHILDREN,

24
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:18,815
STALKING
THE WRETCHED CHILD

25
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:23,319
LIKE A HUNTER STALKS
A BIRD IN THE FOREST.

26
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,821
DID THEY HUNT YOU?

27
00:03:29,826 --> 00:03:32,328
YOU SAID
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

28
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:35,832
A VERY UNPLEASANT
ACCIDENT.

29
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:37,834
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,

30
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:42,338
I TRAVELED THE WORLD IN SEARCH
FOR THE GRAND HIGH WITCH,

31
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:44,340
BUT I NEVER FOUND HER.

32
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,842
I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE

33
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:48,845
THAT ANYONE
HAS EVER FOUND HER.

34
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:51,848
SO IF NO ONE'S SEEN
THE GRAND HIGH WITCH,

35
00:03:51,848 --> 00:03:53,850
HOW ARE YOU SURE
SHE EXISTS?

36
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,351
NOBODY'S EVER SEEN
THE DEVIL,

37
00:03:55,351 --> 00:03:57,353
BUT WE KNOW HE EXISTS,
DON'T WE?

38
00:03:57,353 --> 00:03:58,354
YEAH.

39
00:03:58,354 --> 00:03:59,856
FOR ALL YOU KNOW,

40
00:03:59,856 --> 00:04:03,359
A WITCH MIGHT BE LIVING
NEXT DOOR TO YOU.

41
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,862
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

42
00:04:05,862 --> 00:04:09,365
I LIVED BESIDE A GIRL
CALLED ERICA,

43
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:11,367
WHO WAS TAKEN
BY A WITCH.

44
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:14,370
ERICA HAD VERY
STRICT PARENTS.

45
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,373
BUT EVEN THAT
DIDN'T SAVE POOR ERICA,

46
00:04:17,874 --> 00:04:19,876
BECAUSE WHEN A WITCH
CHOOSES A VICTIM,

47
00:04:20,376 --> 00:04:22,879
THERE IS ONLY
ONE HOPE OF ESCAPE--

48
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:25,882
KNOWING EVERYTHING
ABOUT THEM

49
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:27,884
THAT I AM TELLING YOU.

50
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,385
I'M WARNING YOU.

51
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:32,388
ERICA, COME IN.

52
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:33,890
WHAT MAKES HER
DANGEROUS

53
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,893
IS THE FACT THAT SHE
DOESN'T LOOK DANGEROUS.

54
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:38,394
YOU CAN NEVER BE SURE

55
00:04:38,394 --> 00:04:41,397
IF IT'S A WITCH
YOU ARE LOOKING AT

56
00:04:41,397 --> 00:04:42,899
OR A KIND LADY.

57
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:43,900
[RIBBET]

58
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,287
AH, ERICA.

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,790
HOW DO YOU LIKE
MY NEW PAINTING?

60
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,292
IT'SMAGNIFIQUE,
PAPA.

61
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,794
GO TO LARSEN'S

62
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,296
AND BUY...

63
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,798
A LITER OF MILK.
HMM?

64
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,799
JA,PAPA.

65
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,304
COME STRAIGHT HOME.

66
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:05,805
JA,DA.

67
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,309
REAL WITCHES
HATE CHILDREN.

68
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:16,816
REAL WITCHES
ARE QUITE BALD,

69
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,818
ALTHOUGH, OF COURSE,
THEY WEAR WIGS...

70
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,820
THAT ITCH...

71
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,822
AND CAUSE THEM
SCALP RASH.

72
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,325
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT SCALP RASH IS?

73
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,826
NO.

74
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,828
ITCHING UNDER THE WIG.

75
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,331
IT MUST DRIVE THEM CRAZY.

76
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,334
THEY LOOK QUITE HIDEOUS

77
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:37,337
BEHIND THEIR HUMAN
FACE MASKS

78
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,840
AND CAN ONLY BE DISTINGUISHED
FROM ORDINARY WOMEN

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,842
IF YOU ARE SHARP ENOUGH

80
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,346
TO SPOT THE PURPLE TINGE
TO THEIR EYES.

81
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:51,351
REAL WITCHES
HAVE NO TOES.

82
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,853
THEIR FEET
HAVE SQUARE ENDS,

83
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,357
REVOLTING STUMPS WHERE
THEIR TOES SHOULD BE,

84
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:01,361
SO THEY NEVER WEAR
POINTED OR PRETTY SHOES,

85
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,364
JUST PLAIN,
SENSIBLE SHOES.

86
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:09,369
REMEMBER THESE THINGS.

87
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,373
PERHAPS IF ERICA
HAD KNOWN THEM...

88
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,875
[MEOW]

89
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,383
[MEOW]

90
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,886
HA HA!

91
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,888
Helga: OH, MY POOR ERICA.

92
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,891
FOR WEEKS
THEY SEARCHED,

93
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,394
BUT WITCHES
DON'T MURDER CHILDREN

94
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,396
WITH KNIVES OR GUNS.

95
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,399
THAT'S FOR PEOPLE
WHO GET CAUGHT,

96
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,901
AND WITCHES
NEVER GET CAUGHT.

97
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,905
THEY SEARCHED
FOR MILES AROUND.

98
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,908
EVERYONE IN THE TOWN
SEARCHED,

99
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,912
BUT SHE HAD COMPLETELY
DISAPPEARED.

100
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,423
I WAS THERE IN ERICA'S HOUSE
SIX WEEKS LATER.

101
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,924
GOOD DAY,
FRAU LARSEN.

102
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,427
COME IN, HELGA.
HAVE SOME CAKE.

103
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:10,930
Helga: I WAS HER BEST FRIEND
WHEN IT ALL HAPPENED.

104
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,933
THEN THAT DAY,

105
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,936
WHILE ERICA'S MOTHER
WAS POURING THE COFFEE,

106
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,939
HER FATHER CAME
WALKING TOWARDS US.

107
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,443
IT WAS AS THOUGH
HE HAD SEEN A GHOST.

108
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,445
HIS FACE
WAS ALL TWISTED UP

109
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,448
AS HE WALKED TOWARDS
THE PAINTING BEHIND ME.

110
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:33,453
THERE, AS IF IT
ALWAYS HAD BEEN THERE,

111
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,955
WAS ERICA,

112
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,957
LOCKED
IN THE PAINTING,

113
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,460
GAZING AT US.

114
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,962
PAPA.

115
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,964
PAPA.

116
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,466
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

117
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,968
YOU SAW HER IN THE
PAINTING, GRANDMA?

118
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:49,969
MANY TIMES.

119
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,471
BUT THE PECULIAR THING

120
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,975
WAS THAT LITTLE ERICA KEPT ON
CHANGING HER POSITION

121
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,477
IN THE PICTURE.

122
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,480
SO ONE DAY SHE'D BE
FEEDING THE DUCKS,

123
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,982
THE NEXT DAY SHE'D BE
INSIDE THE FARMHUSE,

124
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,484
LOOKING OUT OF A WINDOW.

125
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,487
DID YOU SEE HER
MOVING IN THE PICTURE?

126
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,988
NOBODY DID.

127
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,991
SHE WAS ALWAYS
JUST A FIGURE

128
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,994
MOTIONLESS
IN THE PAINTING.

129
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,997
AS THE YEARS WENT BY,

130
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,999
ERICA GREW OLDER,
TOO.

131
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:24,504
AND ONLY
FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO,

132
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,507
THE OLD WOMAN
THAT ERICA HAD BECOME,

133
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,009
BENT AND FRAIL
IN THE PAINTING,

134
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,013
BEGAN TO DISAPPEAR.

135
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,517
UNTIL ONE MORNING,

136
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,519
SHE WAS GONE.

137
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,020
YOU MEAN SHE DIED?

138
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,522
WHO KNOWS?

139
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,475
MYSTERIOUS THINGS GO ON
IN THE WORLD OF WITCHES.

140
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:49,695
HEY,
IT'S ALMOST 9:00.

141
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,197
GRANDMA'S
BEEN TELLING ME

142
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:52,698
ABOUT WITCHES,
MOM.

143
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,202
AND FRIGHTENING YOU
BEFORE YOU GO TO SLEEP.

144
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,703
GOOD NIGHT,
DARLING.

145
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,205
EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT,
MOTHER?

146
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,706
Helga:
VERY ALL RIGHT.

147
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,708
GO OFF. ENJOY
YOURSELVES.

148
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,210
GOODBYE,
MOM.

149
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,212
HERE YOU GO.

150
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,214
GOOD NIGHT, SON.

151
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,215
GOOD NIGHT, DAD.

152
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,716
NO MORE STORIES, OK?

153
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,220
OH, NO.

154
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,248
COME ON, GRANDMA.
JUST ONE MORE STORY.

155
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,250
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
ONE MORE.

156
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,252
BUT VERY SHORT.

157
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,255
WITCHES...

158
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,257
ARE VERY CRUEL.

159
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:56,262
AND THEY HAVE A HIGHLY-DEVELOPED
SENSE OF SMELL.

160
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,265
A REAL WITCH COULD SMELL YOU
ACROSS THE STREET

161
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,766
ON A PITCH-BLACK NIGHT.

162
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,769
SHE COULDN'T SMELL ME.
I JUST HAD A SHOWER.

163
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,271
OH, YES, SHE COULD.

164
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,772
THE CLEANER YOU ARE,

165
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,275
THE MORE A WITCH
CAN SMELL YOU.

166
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,776
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

167
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,278
OH, YES, IT DOES.

168
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,281
A DIRTY CHILD,
IT'S THE DIRT SHE SMELLS.

169
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:18,284
A CLEAN CHILD,
IT IS THE CHILD.

170
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,285
WOW.

171
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,788
I'LL NEVER HAVE
A SHOWER AGAIN,

172
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:25,791
AND I'LL HAVE YOU
FOR AN EXCUSE.

173
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,293
WELL, JUST NOT TOO OFTEN.

174
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,296
ONLY ONCE A MONTH
IS PROBABLY SAFE.

175
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,298
SO A WITCH COULD
SMELL ME RIGHT NOW?

176
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,801
TO ME, YOU SMELL OF
RASPBERRIES AND CREAM,

177
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,303
BUT TO A WITCH,

178
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,306
YOU WOULD SMELL
ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.

179
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,808
WHAT KIND
OF DISGUSTING?

180

00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,728
DELIGHTED. SHALL I SIGN
OR SOMETHING?

364
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,230
NO. EVERYTHING
WILL BE FINE.

365
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,731
THIS IS MY SECRETARY.

366
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,733
OH, YES.
HOW ARE YOU?

367
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,734
AH, LADIES.

368
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,736
INA CLAY
BECKMAN.

369
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,737
INDEED.

370
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,738
JULIA WHITMAN.

371
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,740
JULIA, YES.
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

372
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,741
DALLINGER.

373
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,742
AH, YES.

374
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,744
LOIS LEFFOUR
FROM SOUTHAMPTON.

375
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,246
LOIS.

376
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,747
OOH!

377
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,759
IN THERE, I THINK.

378
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,761
THAT'S WHERE
YOU MUST LIVE.

379
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,765
OH, UM, THE CARPETBAG
ON THE BED, PLEASE.

380
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,268
I'LL HAVE
A WASH AND BRUSH-UP

381
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,270
WHILE YOU EXPLORE
THE PLACE, LUKE.

382
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,272
THEN WE SHALL
HAVE TEA TOGETHER,

383
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,774
AND YOU'LL SHOW ME
AROUND, YES?

384
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,775
THANK YOU.

385
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,277
ON'T
LOCK ME OUT.

386
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:21,280
I PROMISE I WON'T.

387
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,789
HMPH.

388
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,792
YOU LOOK WONDERFUL,
MISS ERNST.

389
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,295
WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD
TO THIS AFTERNOON.

390
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,796
HMM.

391
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,799
ALLEZ.

392
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:16,835
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

393
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,338
OH! THE RAISINS
ARE ALL AROUND

394
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,340
THE EDGE OF THESE CAKES.

395
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,841
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.

396
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,842
THANKS.

397
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,346
MY NAME'S LUKE.

398
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,349
BRUNO JENKINS.

399
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,352
THE CUCUMBER SANDWICHES
ARE ALL RIGHT, TOO--

400
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,355
EXCEPT WHEN THEY USE
MARGARINE INSTEAD OF BUTTER.

401
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,358
HOW MUCH POCKET MONEY
DO YOU GET?

402
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,361
MY DAD'S RICH,
BUT HE'S VERY TIGHT.

403
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,862
WE'VE GOT THREE CARS.

404
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,364
HELLO, BOYS.

405
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,367
I HOPE THERE'S BUTTER
IN THE SANDWICHES TODAY.

406
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:51,370
I REALLY DO
HATE MARGARINE.

407
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,373
AH, YOU'VE GOT THOSE
EXCELLENT CAKES AGAIN.

408
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,874
THERE SHOULD BE
14 OF--

409
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,876
AAH! AAH!

410
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:58,877
MR. STRINGER!

411
00:22:58,877 --> 00:22:59,878
OH! OH!

412
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,380
SHH, SHH.
WHAT HAPPENED?

413
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,383
I WENT IN TO
TURN DOWN THE BED,

414
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,884
AND THEY WERE THERE.

415
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,885
WHAT?

416
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,387
WHITE AND DISGUSTING
LITTLE--

417
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,888
NOW, LOOK. CALM DOWN.

418
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,391
[SOBS]

419
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,400
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

420
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,405
IS THIS YOUR ROOM?

421
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:27,406
YES.

422
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,407
YES?

423
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:30,409
I SEE.
I'M SORRY, MADAM,

424
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,412
BUT I CANNOT PERMIT
MICE IN MY HOTEL.

425
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,913
HOW DARE YOU
SAY THAT

426
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,416
WHEN YOUR ROTTEN HOTEL
IS FULL OF RATS ANYWAY?

427
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,419
RATS? THERE ARE NO
RATS IN THIS HOTEL.

428
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,423
I SAW ONE THIS MORNING
RUN INTO THE KITCHENS.

429
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:48,927
MADAM, YOU ONLY ARRIVED IN
THE HOTEL THIS AFTERNOON.

430
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,429
AHH, MORNING, AFTERNOON.

431
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,432
I SAW A RAT
IN YOUR HOTEL,

432
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,934
AND IF MATTERS
DO NOT IMPROVE,

433
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,436
I'LL HAVE TO
REPORT YOU

434
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,438
TO THE PUBLIC
HEALTH AUTHORITIES.

435
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,441
LOOK...

436
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,942
MADAM,
I'M NOT PREPARED--

437
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,444
THE CAKES
IN THE LOUNGE

438
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,946
ARE NIBBLED
AROUND THE EDGES, TOO.

439
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,948
Helga:
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,

440
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,951
THE HEALTH PEOPLE WILL
ORDER THE HOTEL CLOSED

441
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,953
BEFORE EVERYONE
GETS TYPHOID FEVER.

442
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,455
YOU CAN'T
BE SERIOUS.

443
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,957
I HAVE NEVER
BEEN MORE SERIOUS

444
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,459
IN MY LIFE.

445
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,962
NOW, WILL YOU OR WILL YOU
NOT LET MY GRANDCHILD

446
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,965
KEEP HIS HYGIENIC AND
PERFECTLY HARMLESS PET MICE?

447
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:32,971
UH...WELL...

448
00:24:32,91 --> 00:24:35,974
WELL, IF THEY ARE
KEPT IN THE CAGE,

449
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:36,975
ONLY IN THIS ROOM,

450
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,977
NOWHERE ELSE
IN THE HOTEL...

451
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:39,978
AGREED.

452
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,980
VERY WELL.

453
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:53,492
GRANDMA, I CAN'T
TRAIN MY MICE

454
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,494
IF THEY'RE
IN A CAGE.

455
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,496
NIBBLED CAKES, INDEED.

456
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:00,999
THERE WERE, ONLY IT WAS A BOY
CALLED BRUNO JENKINS.

457
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,001
I'M TEACHING
WILLIAM AND MARY

458
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,003
HOW TO BE
TIGHTROPE WALKERS.

459
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,004
MM-HMM.

460
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,007
I BROUGHT SOME
OF THE CIRCUS I'M BUILDING.

461
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,509
GOOD. SHOW ME.

462
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,012
LET'S SEE.

463
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,015
LOOK. I'M PLANNING
THEM A MAJOR HOUSE.

464
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,017
RAMPWAYS HERE.
A BATHTUB.

465
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,519
THIS ELEVATOR'S
PRETTY NEAT.

466
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,522
YOU REALLY DID THIS
YOURSELF? IT'S GOOD.

467
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,524
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
I'M IMPRESSED.

468
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,026
OF COURSE YOU MUST
TRAIN YOUR MICE,

469
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,029
BUT YOU MUSTN'T GET
CAUGHT OR DO IT IN HERE.

470
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:34,032
IF THAT HYSTERICAL MAID
COMES BACK...

471
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,535
WELL, NOW
IT'S TEATIME.

472
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:40,038
I JUST LOVE
ENGLISH HOTEL TEAS.

473
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,040
CREAM CAKES
AND SHORTBREAD

474
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,041
AND, UH--

475
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,042
NO, GRANDMA.

476
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:46,044
NO CREAM
CAKES.

477
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,546
NO SHORTBREAD,
EITHER.

478
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,047
IT'S FULL OF SUGAR.

479
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,533
I SHALL END UP EATING
YOUR MICE'S DIET.

480
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,885
THAT'S THE TROUBLE
WITH THIS COUNTRY.

481
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,387
A QUEUE FOR EVERYTHING.

482
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,889
THEY WOULDN'T THINK TO
HAVE TWO TEA TROLLEYS.

483
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,392
THAT'D BE TOO CONVENIENT
FOR THE PAYING GUESTS.

484
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,394
THEY'LL WANT
TWO LUMPS OF ICE

485
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,895
IN THEIR WHISKEY
NEXT.

486
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,898
THEY'D QUEUE FOR THEIR OWN
FUNERALS IF THEY COULD.

487
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,401
I KNOW THAT WOMAN
FROM SOMEWHERE,

488
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:13,405
BUT I CAN'T FOR THE LIFE
OF ME REMEMBER WHERE.

489
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,409
HER FACE
IS SO FAMILIAR.

490
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,412
WHICH ONE?

491
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,913
MY MEMORY'S GOING,

492
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,916
BUT IT'S AS IF
I MET HER BEFORE.

493
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,419
SHE'S PROBABLY
ON TV OR SOMETHING.

494
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,422
MMM. CUCUMBER
SANDWICHES.

495
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,423
MMM--

496
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,926
FISH PASTE.

497
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,428
Luke:
YOU GOT THE WRONG ONE.

498
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,931
OH, NO. SUGAR.

499
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,434
GRANDMA,
SUGAR CAN KILL YOU.

500
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,437
I KNOW, BUT
IT WAS VERY LITTLE,

501
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,938
VERY LITTLE,
MY DEAR.

502
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,940
SOMETHING VERY ODD
IS GOING ON.

503
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,943
ARE YOU LISTENING?
YOU'LL HAVE SOME FRESH AIR

504
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,946
IF I HAVE TO TAKE YOU
OUT BY YOUR EAR.

505
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,449
YOU'RE NOT HERE TO EAT
AND WATCH TELLY.

506
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,951
OTHER BOYS ARE OUT
PLAYING IN THE WATER.

507
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,453
PICK UP YOUR KNIFE.

508
00:27:01,53 --> 00:27:03,955
JUST LIKE YOUR FATHER.

509
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,963
GOOD AFTERNOON,
MADAM.

510
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:15,467
GO ON.

511
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,969
YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE
ALL RIGHT NOW?

512
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,471
YES, YES.
FINE, FINE.

513
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,974
AND WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO DO NOW?

514
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,477
TAKE WILLIAM AND MARY
AND EXPLORE THIS PLACE.

515
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:28,480
ALL RIGHT. JUST DON'T GET
INTO TROUBLE, WILL YOU?

516
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,481
I WON'T.

517
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,982
COME ON.

518
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,489
EXCUSE ME, PLEASE.

519
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,494
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S FINE.

520
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,997
CARRY ON WITH
THE REST OF THEM.

521
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,500
NO, IN THE KITCHEN.
IN THE KITCHEN.

522
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,053
WAIT THERE.

523
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,560
OHH...

524
00:28:56,384 --> 00:28:57,986
[SQUEAK SQUEAK
SQUEAK SQUEAK]

525
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,988
GREAT.
NOW DO IT AGAIN.

526
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,990
[SQUEAK SQUEAK SQUEAK]

527
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,491
COME ON, COME ON.

528
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,494
I'M SURE YOUR DELEGATES
WILL BE COMFORTABLE IN HERE.

529
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,997
IF WE CAN DO
ANYTHING,

530
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:09,998
OBVIOUSLY, PLEASE
DON'T HESITATE TO--

531
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,499
NICOLA,
DOWN IN FRONT!

532
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,001
TO LET ME KNOW.

533
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,504
NOW, DRINKS WILL BE SERVED
ON THE TERRACE AFTER--

534
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,505
FINE, FINE.

535
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,007
YOU'VE CONCLUDED
YOUR MEETING.

536
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,508
UM, SKIES ARE CLEARING--

537
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,010
COME ON, LADIES.
SIT.

538
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,011
SIT DOWN.

539
