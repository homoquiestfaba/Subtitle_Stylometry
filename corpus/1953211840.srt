- Going somewhere?
- Hey, Marcel.

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,040
I thought it was somebody else.

11
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,640
I mean, if I knew it was you,
I would never run.

Today's your lucky day, Sami.

Normally I'd be breaking
your fingers right now

26
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,480
but I'm going to give you a chance
to make enough to pay me back.

We have a group going to Chicago
to do a job.

- You lived there.

00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,920
- You know the city.
- No. No, no, no, man.

31
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,600
That's not possible, man.
I've still got a few legals problems

back in the States...

33
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,120

- Algeria.

47

And you don't speak French?

48
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,920
Well, you know,
not all Algerians speak French.

you went to. Me, I never really got...

Hopefully no one.

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,080
No one? Then why is Zero here?

54
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,640
He speaks about himself
in the third person?

55
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,680
Feel free to correct him if you want.

What did I tell you when
you came to me for money?

00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,680
Didn't I ask you not to do it?

Did I not say that?
What did I say to him?

You said, "Don't do it," boss.

That's right. Did you listen to me?
No. You wanted the money.

to get up off his ass

and you brought it through customs?

- How stupid is that?
- Zero didn't put it in his bag.

120
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Laurent didn't say there'd be
this many of you.

121
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,320
I guess you'll have to...

122
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,480
um... double up.

123
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,880

Ha! That's cute.

127
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,440
They don't have a wine list.

128
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,080
Well, we'll have the house wine.

129
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,200
Sure. And would you like that

130
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,080
before your escargots
in white truffle sauce?

131
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,760
I did not order escargots.

132
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,160
Hey, they don't serve wine here.

133
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,920
Okay. I will have a beer.

134
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,640
I don't think he's grasping
the concept.

135
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,120
Look, we've got iced tea,
lemonade, Coca Cola,

136
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,600
Sprite or root beer.

137
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,840
Okay. I'll have a Sprite and...

138
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,880
And me too.

139
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,360
Yeah, okay.
We have all Sprite.

140
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,840
Idiot!

141
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,480

142

144
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,200
I understand you're interested
in one of our properties.

145
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,600
Yeah.

00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,920
That warehouse over
on Liberty Street.

147
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,880
The volume on our import
business has risen dramatically.

148
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,560

will be supernumerary

- Super what?

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,040
Supernumerary.

151
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,880
It means betterthan expected.

152
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,800
Then why don't you just fucking
say "betterthan expected"?!

153
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,680
Everybody knows what
"betterthan expected" means.

154
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,600
I'm taking a vocabulary course
to enhance my...

155
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,800
communication skills.

156
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,840
Okay.

157
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,600
How much?

158
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,480
I'm not here to negotiate.

159
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
Why are you here?

160
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,240
To tell you that we're interested
in the property.

161
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,280
You told me that on the phone!

162
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,600
What the hell are you doing here?

163
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,160
Showing off
your communication skills?

164
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,360
Go back to your people and tell them
when they're serious,

165
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,400
to put a number on the table.

166
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,840
Jerk-wad.

167
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,840
How's my brother?

168
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,520
He's over at Saint J's.

169
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,280
They had to put two pins in his arm.

170
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,840
I said a clean break!

171
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,720
Hey, boss, it's not a science.

172
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,520
Send him some flowers.

173
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,760
Something nice.
Roses or carnations.

174
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,040
And one of them
"get well soon" cards too.

175
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,640
Okay, there's
an exterior alarm system

176
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,160
with a motion detector.

177
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,600
The control panel is in the bedroom.

178
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,840
Good. So...

179
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,080
Zero and Julien will go
through the window

180
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,960
and disable the motion detector

181
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,280
and we'll come in
through the front door.

182
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,880
- So when do we go?
- Tonight.

183
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,080
Tonight?

Well, I know they won't be
home tonight.

You never heard of jetlag?

186
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,160
Take a nap.

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,720
What about transportation?

Neighbors.
They do this all the time.

193
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,640
- I will talk to them.
- Yeah, right.

194
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,680
That's not a good idea.

195
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,680
It is just a matter of communication.

196
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,840
Hello!

00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,680
My name is Raymond!

198
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,320
I am visiting next door
and I was wondering

199
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,680
if you could make your music
a little less loud!

200
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,240
No!

Hey!

00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,440
Wouldn't it be great if they made
some kind of electronic device

240
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,880
that allowed people to talk to one
another over long distances?

241

What a tremendous communication
aid that would be, huh?

242
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,640
Mr G wanted me to tell you
face-to-face.

He feels it adds a personal touch.

- Personal touch?
- Yeah. You know.

to tell him we're French?

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,000
- Why are you telling us this?
- Professional courtesy.

364
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,000
Besides, it would be more fun
to find you myself.

365
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,480
Last chance, boys.

366
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,000
Do the smart thing.

367
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,760
I really don't know.

368
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,880
Maybe if we did just leave...

369
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,320
Mr Bastaldi said to take
what we have.

370
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,320
You think he's just going
to forget about this?

371
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,480
He's coming after us.
We may as well take the money.

372
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,480
We're going out the back.

373
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,400
Be seeing you!

374
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,080
I'll eat your fucking legs,
you frogs!

375
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,680
Shut up!

376
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,600
What the hell are
they doing in there?

377
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,440
[Phone ringing]

378
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,560
Yeah?

[Heavy breathing]

381
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,080
Oh, yeah...

382
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,840
Oh, yeah, baby...

383
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,720
[loud moaning]

384
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,520
Oh, give it to me.
That's good, that's good.

385
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,760
Hmm?

386
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,080
Oh, yeah, just keep it going.
Keep it going for me.

387
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,360
[Angry grunting]

388
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,280
I'm getting there.
Keep it going, sweetheart.

389
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,160
Give it to Papa Joey.

390
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,080
Joey, who is that?

391
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,360
Uh... And don't call here
again, you pervert!

392
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,040
A pervert.

393
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,760
[Phone ringing]

394
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,760
[Grunting]

395
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,520
Yeah, boss?

396
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,840
[Angry moaning]

397
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,520
Boss?

398
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,000
I wasn't expecting you guys
back this fast.

399
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,440
So how'd it go?

400
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,120
You gave us the wrong address,
Sophie.

401
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,680
No, I didn't.

402
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:40,480
Bastaldi got the address
from you. Yes?

403
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,440
- Yes.
- And he gave it to us.

404
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,440
9945, Ridgeway Road.

405
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,840
No. 9945, Ridgeroad Way.

406
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,360
Ah, that moron.

407
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,160
Oh, it's an honest mistake, you know.

408
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,000
Ridgeway Road, Ridgeway Street.
Hmm?

409
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,200
Okay, let's go to sleep.
We leave early tomorrow morning.

410
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,480
Do you think we could have
a hostage situation in there?

411
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,680
Now, hold on a second.
Joey Two-Tons just pulled up.

412
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
Jesus, boss!

413
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,480
Hey, what happened here, hey?

414
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,160
Are you okay?

415
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,200
Joey... Joey...

416
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,000
Yeah... I'm here.

417
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,280
Joey...

418
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,240
Pick me the fuck up!

419
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,800
Oh, oh, okay.

420
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,080
Hang on there, huh?

421
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,840
Fucking moron!

422
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,880
They're all French guys.

423
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,440
French guys?

424
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,520
You mean like...
French from France?

425
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,320
Yeah. French guys from France.

426
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,120
Hmm. What did they take?

427
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,960
- Everything!
- Everything?

428
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,720
Like I told you, boss, you are
handling this very well.

429
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,480
You know why I'm handling
this very well?

430
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,440
Because you're going
to find them for me.

431
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,480
Yeah, sure.
Don't worry about it.

432
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,280
I get them for you.

433
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,960
Now would be a good time to start.

434
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,160
Oh. Okay.

435
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,440
Hey!

436
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,960
Papa Joey?

437
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,520
Can't sleep?

438
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,120
Aaargh!

439
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,120
Somebody stole my cartonight.

440
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,000
Come on, Raphael, you don't think
that I would steal your car?

441
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,520
You stole my cousin Enrique's car.

442
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,880
Hector. Don't interrupt me.

443
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,400
- But, Raph, he...
- Hector!

444
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,320
He told Enrique that he didn't know
anything about his car!

445
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,720
I don't give a shit
about your cousin's car.

446
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,360
We're here about my car.

447
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,040
So...

448
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,560
Shut your mouth!

449
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,000
Ohh...

450
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,000
If I find out you're lying,

451
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,720
I'm going to come back

452
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,640
and I'm going to cut off your nose.

453
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,280
Vamos.

454
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,000
Sophie!

455
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,840
She's not here, man.

456
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,560
Where is she?

457
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,760
Uh... I think she went
to see someone.

458
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,760
She... uh... put some stuff
into a bag and then left.

459
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,680
Fuck!

460
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,920
Oh, shit!

461
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,120
Fuck!

462
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,320
Fuck! Shit!

463
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,800
Oh, man!

464
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,280
[Snoring]

465
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,840
We've been ripped off!

466
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,080
- Huh?
- De quoi?

467
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,880
Oh, man, this is bullshit!

468
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,920
We can't trust anyone these days.

469
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,600
She took everything?

470
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,480
Not everything.

471
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,640
I was going to listen
to it last night but I...

472
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
I fell asleep.

473
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,200
Ha! Ha! Ha!
No, you didn't, man.

474
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,560
Uh... you were banging Sophie.

475
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,480
I saw you guys going at it.

476
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,280
You slept with her?

477
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:33,240
Well, actually, I would say
she slept with me.

478
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,080
Heh, heh, heh...

479
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,640
You didn't think it was
a little suspicious

480
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,280
that someone you only knew
for a few hours

481
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,400
wanted to sleep with you?

482
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,920
No.

483
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,760
Chicks dig me.

484
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,760
[Phone ringing on tape]

485
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,920
[Man]: Yeah?

486
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,040
[Zammeti]: It's me. I need an
answer from you if I'm going to move.

487
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,240
[Man]: We're not just talking
about a piece of work here.

488
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,240
We're talking about a boss.

489
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,840
[Zammeti]:
Giancarlo's a dinosaur.

490
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,120
The guy thinks he's fucking
Vito Corleone or something.

491
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,280
The old ways are gone.

492
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,920
If we don't change now,
we're going to get pushed out.

493
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,120
I need to know if I can count
on your support.

494
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,280
[Man]: Yeah.

495
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,880
No wonder Zammeti didn't want us
to walk out with the tapes.

496
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,840
He's planning on killing Giancarlo
and taking over the family.

497
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,560
This wasn't the deal.

498
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,840
The deal was to steal the necklace,

499
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,880
not get in the middle of a mafia war!

500
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,680
The deal is whatever
Mr Bastaldi says it is.

501
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,560
- We have to find Sophie.
- How are we going to do that?

502
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,200
I know where she went.

503
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,280
- Don't turn here.
- I know where I'm going.

504
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,800
- It's the wrong way!
- Shut up!

505
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,800
- Yo, Raph...
- Hector, shut up!

506
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,840
Don't say anything unless I ask you.

507
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,800
Hector, tell me the truth.

508
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,160
Do you think I'm ever going
to find my car?

509
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,160
Uh... it's hard to say.

510
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,600
Hey... Hi. Uh...

511
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,800
Did a woman just check in?

512
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,080
She's about five-six,
dark, long hair.

513
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,760
Uh... pretty.

514
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,840
I can't give out information
on our guests.

515
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,880
Come on, man.
I think she's having an affair.

516
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,840
So are half the people in this place.

517
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,640
Can't help you, pal.

518
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,240
Look, I already told you...
Room 14.

519
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,520
The money isn't here.

520
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,600
Where is it, Sophie?

521
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,600
I don't know.

522
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,240
Who are you waiting for?

523
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,200
Why don't you stick around
and find out?

524
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,040
Okay.

525
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,000
[Knocking on door]

526
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,080
He's FBI.

527
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,520
We've been set up.

528
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,480
We didn't go to the wrong house,
We went to the right one.

529
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,080
Didn't we, Sophie?

530
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,040
They sent us to Zammeti's house.

531
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,280
The FBI is just across the street
watching the whole thing

532
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,400
and they don't move.

533
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,000
Why?

534
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:52,560
Because they were waiting for us
to come out so they could arrest us.

535
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,600
What does arresting us get them?

536
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,760
Do you want to tell him?

537
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,680
You're telling it fine.

538
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,920
Aaargh! Ah!

539
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,400
Okay, okay!

540
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,320
We've been investigating
Zammeti for years

541
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
but we never had enough evidence

542
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,400
for a warrant to search his house.

543
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,760
We got word through a snitch

544
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,760
that Zammeti was planning
to take Giancarlo out.

545
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,920
Our informant told us
that Zammeti was talking

546
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,840
to other bosses and
recording the conversations.

547
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,240
So we rob Zammeti,

548
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,080
you arrest us when we come out

549
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,120
and the contents of the safe
is now evidence

550
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,480
which you can use against him.

551
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:44,160
Why us?

552
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,240
Vincent Bastaldi's in jail.

553
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,160
Last time Vincent was here, he asked
me to meet him outside the city.

554
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,040
Before he could tell me
what he wanted,

555
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,520
the FBI showed up and arrested him.

556
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,640
Arrested him forwhat?

557
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,800
Laurent and Vincent were
in business with Zammeti.

558
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,440
What kind of business?

559
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,520
Black market art.

560
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,040
Zammeti got to a few key
security guards in the museum.

561
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,840
Bastaldi supplied the artists
to make copies of famous works.

562
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,480
They'd switch the paintings
and the originals to Paris,

563
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,120
and the Bastaldis would sell
them to private collectors.

564
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,920
We know they replaced Van Gogh's

565
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
'Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers'
with a copy last week.

566
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:34,160
If we got the tapes,

567
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,400
we'd release his brother,

568
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,960
providing he tells us
where the Van Gogh

569
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,560
and the other paintings are.

570
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,960
No one has mentioned
the part of the plan

571
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:46,920
about us getting caught
and going to prison.

572
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,000
We're leaving.
Raymond, get the bag.

573
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,200
If you leave with those tapes,

574
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,560
you'll never get out of the city.

575
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,600
Did they know who you were
when they broke in the house?

576
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,160
Yes.

577
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,520
What's happening with the world?

578
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:14,600
There was a time when no civilian
would touch a made man.

579
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,240
What did they take?

580
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,760
Some cash, some jewelry.

581
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,200
The other stuff I can replace

582
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,520
but there's a cardboard box.

583
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,880
Photos of my mother.

584
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:28,280
They're the only ones I have of her.

585
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,480
We're doing everything
we can to find these people.

586
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,200
Right, Tony?

587
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,080
Believe me, we've reached out
to everyone we know.

588
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,040
If they're still stupid enough
to be in this city,

589
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,200
Tony will find them.

590
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,440
- All right!
- I'm closer, I'm closer.

591
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,240
- Why, are you blind here orwhat?
- What? Are you nuts?

592
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,160
Frankie, come here for a sec, please.

593
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,520
Get in the car.

594
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,000
Who's closerto the wall?
Joey or me?

595
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,240
You are. Now get in the car.

596
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,040
This is turning to shit.

597
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,480
You find them. You're the FBI.

598
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,240
Ah. I can't bring
the Bureau into this.

599
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,800
If I do the tapes become evidence.

600
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,320
They're supposed to be evidence.

601
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,400
That's why Bastaldi set this up.

602
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,160
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother!

603
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,160
Those tapes are gold.

604
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:24,800
Do you have any idea what
Zammeti would pay to get them back?

605
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,880
Too many people know
about my involvement in this.

606
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,720
Then we'll just have to make
sure that everyone who knows

607
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,440
can't say anything.

608
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,680
You're right about that.

609
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,960
I would like to thank you
for your hospitality.

610
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:03,640
If you are ever in Paris...

611
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,600
here is my number.

612
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,160
Cool. Yeah.

613
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,920
What, man?

614
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,520
What?

615
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,800
Guns. Can you get them?

616
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:20,920
- Man, I can get anything.
- Don't bullshit me.

617
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,240
I ain't bullshitting.
I can get guns.

618
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,680
I can get you any kind of gun
you want.

619
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,680
See? But that ain't going
to help your sorry ass.

620
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,640
That man's carthat you stole,
Raphael Ruiz...

621
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,680
Yeah, well, he's the leader
of the 19th Street Gang

622
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,840
and one disturbed motherfucker.

623
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,960
And Frankie Zammeti already put
the word out on the street

624
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,360
that he's looking
for some French dudes.

625
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,360
You're French, ain't you?

626
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,880
- I'm from Belgium.
- Shit.

627
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,880
I'd be from Belgium too,
if I was you.

628
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,760
You know, Zammeti just put
his own brother in the hospital.

629
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,000
Broke his arm because
he was late on a debt.

630
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,760
You see, I mention this to illustrate

631
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,360
the kind of people
who are looking for you.

632
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,360
Why haven't you turned us in?

633
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,480
I ain't no rat.

634
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,520
- You've got money, right?
- Uh-huh.

635
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,240
- Cool.
- Have you got a cell phone?

636
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,600
Hell, yeah, I've got a cell phone.
My damn grandma has a cell phone.

637
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,760
Okay. You give me the number
and I call you later.

638
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,600
Yeah, you do that.

639
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,160
Fine.

640
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,600
Cool.

641
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,800
[Loud banging on door]

642
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,320
Hey, man. No, no.
What are you doing?

643
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,000
Oh, excuse me.

644
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,040
Don't you need a search warrant
or something?

645
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:49,040
- Not today. Where are your friends?
- They left about a half hour ago.

646
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,960
- Yeah. Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

647
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,560
Aargh!

648
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,080
Oh, man, you can't do that!

649
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,160
What? This?

650
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,640
Aargh!

651
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,800
Huh? Orthis?

652
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,840
If you don't want me
to keep on hurting you,

653
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,480
it's important that I believe
you and right now I don't.

654
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,880
So tell me.
Where did they go?!

655
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,040
I swear, man. I don't know.

656
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,320
They packed up and left
a half hour ago.

657
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:17,640
They left a number for a guy
in Paris that's on the table.

658
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,320
Hmm. Thanks.

659
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,360
Ah!

660
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,000
Hey, Sami. You're on TV.

661
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,920
Police want to question Sami Zerhouni

662
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,760
in connection with the murder
of Sophie Greer.

663
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,160
What?

664
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,440
Police have confirmed
Zerhouni was seen

665
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,480
entering the woman's room
by the motel manager.

666
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:04,040
They also want to talk to Zerhouni
regarding a robbery last night

667
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,480
at the home of alleged mafia
member Frankie Zammeti.

668
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,360
Bastaldi, you fuck!

669
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,480
The other members of his gang
are reported to be

670
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:15,680
French nationals Daniel Foray,
Marcel Bonnet,

671
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,680
Julien Labesse and Raymond Gayet...

672
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,360
Huh. Dumb crackers.

673
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,720
And an unidentified man
known only as Zero.

674
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:24,880
(laughing)

675
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,920
That ought to shake things up.

676
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,240
Up next: A vacation getaway
on a budget.

677
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,920
We'll be right back.

678
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,680
This is bad.

679
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,520
This is really fucking bad!

680
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,840
Am I the only one who sees
how bad this is?

681
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,680
Hey, this is not your picture
on TV, it's mine!

682
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,040
So try to be cool!

683
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,640
Don't tell me to be cool.
We were supposed to be in and out.

684
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:49,240
In the last twenty-four hours,

685
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:51,600
we've managed to get the mafia,
the FBI,

686
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,640
the Chicago Police Department

687
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,080
and a group of latin gang
members after us!

688
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,400
We have to get out of here.

689
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,920
That's brilliant.
Care to elaborate?

690
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,960
You're not helping.

691
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,720
What you're doing right now
is a very normal

692
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,000
psychological reaction to stress.

693
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,200
You're projecting your anger
on to us.

694
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,280
Oh, Jesus.

695
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,920
We're dead.

696
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,560
[Phone ringing]

697
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,720
- Yeah?
- It's me.

698
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,880
Hey! You guys are
becoming famous.

699
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,360
I was just watching the news and...

700
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,360
Did you set it up?

701
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,160
Man, yeah, I set it up.

702
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,680
Tomorrow morning, ten o'clock.

703
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,840
[Phone ringing]

704
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,560
Pogue.

705
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,120
What's happening over there?

706
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,080
Your idiots are getting smarter.

707
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,240
Sami, you steal a wallet

708
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,480
from someone who looks
like one of us.

709
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,600
- What for?
- To rent a car. And forthat

710
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,160
we need a credit card.

711
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,440
Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

712
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,840
I'm gonna have to search you!

713
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,640
We'll save you the trouble.

714
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,200
You can't come in here with that!

715
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,960
What's wrong with this guy?

716
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,680
He's my cousin. He's deaf.

717
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,840
We're here to buy, not to steal.

718
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,240
You can let them in.

719
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,200
Yo, man, what the hell are you doing?

720
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,880
Hey, look, I gave
these dudes my word.

721
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,360
Fuck yourword!

722
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,640
Zammeti's offering twenty grand
a head forthese guys.

723
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,160
Do you think I'm going
to settle for four g's

724
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,200
when I could make forty?

725
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,240
Reach in easy
and put the gun on the floor.

726
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,760
Easy!

727
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,240
I said put it on the floor,
not kick it under the bed.

728
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:02,600
Get that and add it to my inventory.

729
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,120
I assume you're carrying too?

730
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,840
Okay, put it on the floor

731
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,320
and do not kick it
under the fucking bed.

732
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,560
Listen, cowboy,

733
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:25,080
if you're even thinking
about making a move, don't.

734
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,920
Nobody's that fast.

735
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,320
Zero is.

736
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,040
Who the fuck is Zero?

737
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,960
He is.

738
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,360
I found it!

739
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,720
Man, you're crazy. Give me my money,
I can get the hell out of here.

740
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,120
There is one more thing
I need you to do.

741
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,880
What, man?

742
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,080
Hello.

743
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:37,920
Hello. I'm James Picarney
from Dayton, Ohio,

744
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,120
and I would like to rent a car
with my gold card.

745
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,840
Let me check and see what we've got.

746
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:57,080
Yeah, I've got a couple of French
guys here trying to rent a car.

747
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,440
So... I've come by to see
how you're doing.

748
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,000
What do you want, Frankie?

749
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,440
I just wanted to say

750
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,840
that... uh...

751
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,640
upon reflection...

752
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,080
that I may have overreacted
a little the other day.

753
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,560
A little?

754
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,480
I mean, you are my brother and, well,

755
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,920
I should have found anotherway
of expressing my disappointment.

756
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,720
So I've decided to make it up to you.

757
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,840
You going to forget
about the money I owe you?

758
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,680
What? Are you nuts?
A debt is a debt.

759
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,720
I was thinking of throwing
a little extra work yourway.

760
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,760
You come down to the club
and make espresso for the boys.

761
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:48,040
Run some errands, things like that.

762
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:52,840
Vinny.

763
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,360
Joey.

764
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,840
Hey, uh...

765
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,800
no hard feelings about
the other day, huh?

766
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,280
It was just business.

767
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,760
Are you doing okay?

768
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,840
Uh... my arm, it itches.

769
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,600
Do not scratch it with a coat hanger.

770
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,960
It can cause an infection.

771
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,240
My cousin Ernie...

772
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:14,040
Did you come in here for a reason?

773
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:17,880
Yeah. Uh... Some guy
in a car rental called Nicky,

774
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:21,440
he might have a line on our friends.

775
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,360
[Phone ringing]

776
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:26,240
Pogue.

777
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,080
If you everwant to get those tapes,

778
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,680
meet me in ten minutes at
Grand Park, by the Conservatory.

779
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,520
Sorry about the wait.
There's... uh...

780
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,920
a problem with the equipment.

781
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,960
It should only be a few more minutes.

782
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,160
You tried to set me up,
you piece of shit.

783
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,560
Hey, what are you doing?

784
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,640
You think I'm going to talk
until I see if you're wired?

785
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,960
You killed her.

786
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,760
No. You killed her.

787
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,080
The manager remembers you
going into her motel room.

788
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,920
Your fingerprints were found
all over the place.

789
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,680
You're fucked, Sami, and you know it.
That's why you're here.

790
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,840
Look, I just want
out of this nightmare.

791
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,320
Okay? I don't know these guys.

792
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,360
Where are the tapes?

793
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:23,360
I can get them.

794
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,480
But what do I get if I do?

795
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,480
- A pass.
- A pass?

796
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,440
How are you going to give me a pass?

797
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,400
Awitness can put me
at the crime scene.

798
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,240
Witnesses can be convinced
they made a mistake.

799
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,680
And without the murderweapon,

800
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,120
the DA doesn't have enough
to prosecute you.

801
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,760
They don't have a murderweapon?

802
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,320
No... I do.

803
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,240
The lamp. The one with her blood

804
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,800
and your fingerprints all over it.
Remember?

805
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,480
Of course, they could always get
an anonymous tip,

806
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,720
find it in a dumpster
behind the motel...

807
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,040
You want the tapes for yourself.

808
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,760
You're going to sell them to Zammeti.

809
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:03,000
I am going to retire
with a shitload of money,

810
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:07,000
find a nice little country with
no extradition treaty with the States,

811
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,880
live the good life.

812
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:10,880
You didn't have to kill Sophie.

813
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,600
Yes, I did.

814
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,680
Loose ends are messy.

815
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,120
When you get the tapes,

816
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,400
you call me at that number.

817
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,720
We'll make the exchange.

818
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,840
That'll be the end of it.

819
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,160
I don't know about the little one

820
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:43,120
but the other guy is
definitely one of them.

821
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,760
Looking good in your jacket.

822
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,800
One of your mother's gift?

823
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,000
You look younger.

824
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:01,920
No!

825
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:08,920
No!

826
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:32,840
It's not your fault, Daniel.

827
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,680
We had the chance
to walk out of Zammeti's house.

828
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,040
We all agreed to it.

829
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:40,280
You had no way of knowing
Bastaldi was setting us up.

830
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:44,280
I just want to live long enough
to get back to Paris.

831
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:47,600
Just long enough to kill him.

832
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,880
I say we make him pay first.

833
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,640
And then you can do
whatever you want to him.

834
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,640
He's right!
Do you have any idea

835
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,840
what Van Gogh's "Vase
With Fifteen Sunflowers" is worth?

836
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,120
It's got to be millions!

837
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,440
We still have to get out of here.

838
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,920
Maybe if we gave the tapes back...

839
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,320
No.

840
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,720
They killed our friend.

841
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:15,320
It's personal now.

842
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,160
Besides, if we do that,

843
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,200
then Julien died for nothing.

844
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,440
The tapes are the key.

845
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,360
I ain't seen your ride, cabrón.

846
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,000
Mrs Gayet?

847
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,640
Yes. Do you speak English?

848
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,360
Ah, you do. Great.

849
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,040
I'm a friend of Raymond...

850
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,600
You taught Raymond
how to speak English too...

851
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:55,520
Well, you did a wonderful job.

852
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,680
Yeah?

853
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,120
Do you know who you should
talk to is Freddy O?

854
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,480
I thought he was in prison.

855
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:03,280
No, man, he just got out last month.

856
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,440
Are you sure they're our guys?

857
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,320
I'm sorry to call so late...

858
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,560
And the other one?

859
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,480
But I'm supposed to meet Raymond...

860
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:13,520
A French passport?

861
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,200
Well, what else did you find on him?

862
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,240
I'm supposed to meet Raymond tonight

863
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,480
at his hotel and I've forgotten...

864
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,240
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

865
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,200
A hotel card key?

866
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,600
He's trying to play it straight

867
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,600
but he's still wired in, ese,
working in some restaurant.

868
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:30,960
What hotel?

869
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,480
The Evening Light Inn,

870
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,400
Room 412.

871
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:45,840
I don't believe someone
would have the balls

872
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,840
- to rip off your ride, ese.
- Coño hombre.

873
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,080
When I find him, he's not
going to have them anymore.

874
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:52,360
I'll ask around.

875
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,920
If they try to move it,
I can find out.

876
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,760
Excuse me. I was here first.

877
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,480
[Phone ringing]

878
01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:02,960
Listen, buddy.
You just can't push in here.

879
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,560
- Go away.
- I most certainly will not go away.

880
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,280
Allô?

881
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:37,480
Get out the room. You've got company
coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.

882
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,200
Ah, mais c'est incroyable!
Merde! Ah!

883
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,280
You fuck. This isn't over.

884
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:54,720
Aaah!

885
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:30,960
Hoy!

886
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,120
- Get back out there!
- You get out there!

887
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:56,200
[Gunshot]

888
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,040
Let me drive! Let me drive!

889
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:29,680
Are you ready to go?

890
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,200
Yeah.

891
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,120
What happened?

892
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,240
They sort of...

893
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,720
got away.

01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:48,480
No, Raph, I want to come with you.

1073
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,880
Hector!

1074
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,680
Wait! In the car!

1075
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:57,000
La concha de tu madre.

1076
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,960
Vamos.

1077
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:21,920
Does anybody know
about the car outside?

1078
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:24,440
Yeah. It's mine.

1079
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:28,120
No. It's mine!

1080
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,960
- The hell it is!
- I'm telling you.

1081
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:36,600
That's my car and somebody
is going to pay for it.

1082
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:39,640
And I'm telling you it ain't!

1083
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,160
Now turn yourtaco-eating
ass around

1084
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:42,720
and get the hell out of here.

1085
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,280
Give me the fucking keys!

1086
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,920
- Fuck you, re-fry!
- Fuck me? Ha! Ha!

1087
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,560
Fuck you!

1090
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:43,080

[music from the restaurant
still playing]

1092
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:16,600
[Zammeti]: Angelo, we can't
lean too hard on this guy.

1093
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:18,760
He's a congressman.

1094
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:49,680
How are you doing?

1095
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,880
I think that's what they call
a rhetorical question,

1096
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,360
being that I already know the answer,

1097
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:57,640
which is, in your case,

1098
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:59,400
not so good.

1099
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:03,480
Your driver's been replaced.

1100
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,560
Who are you?

1101
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:08,040
I'm an associate
of Angelo Giancarlo's

1102
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:11,200
and I'm here to express
his displeasure with you.

1103
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:16,320
Can we work something out?

1104
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,280
I'm afraid not, sport.

1105
01:33:02,360 --> 01:33:04,320
I can't believe you didn't check it.

1106
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,560
I'm sorry. I did a mistake.

1107
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:10,360
I suppose that none of you have
ever made a mistake before.

1108
01:33:10,440 --> 01:33:12,600
This is great. After everything
we've been through,

1109
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:14,800
we've got twelve hundred dollars

1110
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,440
and a fucking autographed baseball!

1111
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:21,040
- The baseball's mine.
- No, you can't have the baseball.

1112
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:22,400
Why not?

1113
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,040
You're not entitled to it.

1114
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:26,280
I took it.
The baseball's mine.

1115
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:28,040
If you say "baseball" one more time,

1116
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:29,960
Zero will shoot you.

1117
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,600
Raymond,

1118
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:34,120
don't you think
they're overreacting a little?

1119
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:35,640
No.

1120
01:33:35,720 --> 01:33:39,480
I think they have a right
to express their angerwith you!

1121
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:42,240
Like... after the fact

1122
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,600
that you... fuck...

1123
01:33:44,640 --> 01:33:46,160
fucking moron!

1124
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:50,040
Why could you not check the money?!

1125
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:51,600
You goddamn stupid

1126
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:54,120
idiot!!!

1127
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:02,920
Fine.

1128
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,840
All of you want to be angry,
be angry.

1129
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,960
But I'm the one who took
the ball and that makes it mine.

1130
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:10,880
No.

1131
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:12,920
- Come on, give it to me, Sami.
- No.

1132
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,760

- I said no!

Give it to me!

And... action!

1137
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:28,880
Have you got a cell phone?

1138
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,200
Ha! Ha!

1139
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:32,480
Hell, yeah, I've got a cell phone.

[Crew laughing]

1141
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:38,280
Without a murderweapon, the DA
doesn't have enough to prosecute you.

1142
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:39,680
They don't have a murderweapon?

1143
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:42,400
No. But did I ever show you
my FBI ring?

1145
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:48,680
What are you doing?

1146
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:51,400
We came here to steal.
We shouldn't leave empty handed.

1147
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:53,480
Leave it!

Do you think it's smart
to tell him you're French?

1151
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:06,120

I'm not a loose hand?
