1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,170
Yee haw!

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:10,870
Yee haw!

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,810
Yee haw.

4
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,810
My god, June.

5
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:34,460
Don't you ever quit?

6
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,280
Not until I have what I want.

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,160
Look, I told you.

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,670
I'm not going to discuss
 or make a decision

9
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,370
on the topless calendar until
 I see how the tour goes.

10
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,340
That's six months, baby.

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,680
My career could be over by then.

12
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,780
I need the exposure now.

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,630
Mm.

14
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,390
Well, I think maybe we
 could work something out.

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,170
Yeah?

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,010
Yeah.

17
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:00,710
Mm.

18
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:10,180
Pig
 Hollow, population 101.

19
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,410
That's me driving.

20
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:12,280
I'm Bob Bob.

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,780
I'm the smart one.

22
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,910
It's April, May, and June.

23
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,470
It's the Three Seasons girls.

24
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:19,610
Don't they just make
 your mouth water?

25
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,760
Them city girls don't
 give a lick about us

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,410
country boys, especially
 those that run moonshine.

27
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,290
When are you going to get
 that through your thick skull?

28
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,380
But Bob Bob.

29
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,050
The
 idiot sitting next to me,

30
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,210
that's my brother, Joe Bob.

31
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:34,000
He's the reason we got
 into this whole mess.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,820
You'll hear about
 that soon enough.

33
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,520
Ah.

34
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,090
Some folks
 might say selling moonshine is

35
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,370
a dangerous business,
 especially when

36
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,460
low down farmers like
 the Jackson brothers

37
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,580
try to get a piece
 of the action.

38
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,280
Ugh.

39
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,920
What are we going to do now?

40
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,170
We should start
 giving them stuff.

41
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:56,920
Never.

42
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,280
No one gets our moonshine.

43
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,640
Normally,
 we're peaceful folk here

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,340
in Pig Hollow.

45
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,770
But when the Jackson
 brothers threaten

46
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,650
our lives and our
 moonshine,

47
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,220
that's going a bit too far.

48
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,650
And something else is
 even more dangerous--

49
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,120
women.

50
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,100
Put that away, Joe Bob.

51
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,590
Can't you see you're
 getting us killed right now?

52
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,080
But Bob Bob, this
 is a new issue.

53
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,610
Oh, lord.

54
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,310
Hold on, girls.

55
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,600
Did we make it?

56
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,440
Oh, open your eyes, you baby.

57
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,230
I swear, sometimes I can't
 believe you're my brother.

58
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,330
Of course we made it.

59
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,730
We always make it.

60
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,240
No thanks to you and
 them Three Seasons girls.

61
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,240
Ahh!

62
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,320
Ugh.

63
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,550
Oh, them thieving bastards,
 I'll just kick their butt.

64
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:20,080
Say that when them boys is
 awake, and I might believe you.

65
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,340
Well, just get it going then.

66
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,190
Well, to be on the safe side,
 we'd better take the shortcut

67
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,300
through Ghost Gulch.

68
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,680
Ghost Gulch, we
 can't go through there.

69
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,960
It's haunted, you know that.

70
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,610
Them boys is going
 to be awake any minute.

71
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,810
It's our only chance.

72
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,250
Ghost Gulch it is then.

73
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,050
I'd do anything for my gals.

74
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,150
Well, looky here.

75
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,610
Couple of jailbirds.

76
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,510
Howdy, Sheriff.

77
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,270
Now, far
 off in that crazy city folks

78
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,600
call Hollywood, the Three
 Seasons girls, or the ones

79
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,730
Joe Bob's so crazy
 about, are getting

80
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,050
ready to make a new calendar.

81
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,520
Already, it would take a saint
 to resist what these girls got.

82
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,480
Looking good, let me
 see you a little bit.

83
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,190
Good, good.

84
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,890
Perfect, perfect, perfect.

85
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:03,930
Let me see a little bit more.

86
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,670
Keep your chin up just
 a little bit higher.

87
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,960
Perfect.

88
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,310
All right, there you go.

89
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,010
All right.

90
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,010
Oh, beautiful.

91
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,550
Let me see you a
 little bit more.

92
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,290
OK, perfect, perfect.

93
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,520
This one's June.

94
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,570
June, let me see you.

95
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,880
There you go.

96
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,420
April.

97
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:20,150
Get yourselves together just
 a little bit more for me, OK?

98
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,360
Let me see you all together.

99
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,990
Perfect.

100
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,560
There you go.

101
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,990
Oh, oh, yeah.

102
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,700
There you go.

103
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,440
Perfect, April.

104
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,340
Work.

105
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,240
Dang.

106
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,530
Beautiful, beautiful.

107
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:34,500
OK.

108
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,530
Keep your chin up
 a little bit more.

109
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,550
Oh, yeah, great.

110
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,540
Great.

111
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,380
Oh my god.

112
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,920
All right, May, June, why
 don't you two take five and let

113
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,650
me finish this roll with April?

114
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,980
Where was I anyway?

115
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,680
Oh.

116
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,700
Oh, yeah, May.

117
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,920
Ah.

118
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,230
This one's April.

119
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,880
She's the leader of
 the group, and she's

120
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,910
just as sweet as can be.

121
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:55,880
Let me see you, sweetheart.

122
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,060
How's this, David?

123
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,520
That's great.

124
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,480
That's great.

125
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,470
Little did these girls

126
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,310
realize fate was about to
 deal them an interesting hand.

127
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,460
Hi, baby.

128
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,160
How's it going?

129
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,680
Don't hey, baby me.

130
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,690
When are you going to
 tell April about us?

131
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,830
Well, you know I
 can't do that just yet.

132
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,030
We've got the calendar deal
 and the tour coming up.

133
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,590
Once the tour is over, then--

134
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,820
No!

135
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,160
Although April is
 my best friend,

136
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,680
I am sick of her getting
 all the attention.

137
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,990
It's time for me to
 be in the spotlight.

138
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,690
Not her.

139
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,300
Shh, shh, now calm down.

140
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,360
I promised I'd listen to
 your ideas, and I have.

141
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,620
We'll just have to wait till--

142
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:48,510
If you say after the
 tour, I will kill you.

143
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,840
Now either you
 tell her or I will.

144
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,820
Oh.

145
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,890
Oh, sorry, babe, I gotta go.

146
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,240
Look, we'll talk about
 this later tonight, OK?

147
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,860
Good luck with the shoot.

148
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,790
Perfect,
 perfect, there you go.

149
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,490
Oh, good.

150
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,720
There you go.

151
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,690
Come on.

152
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,390
There you go.

153
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,610
Perfect.

154
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,450
Congratulations on that new
 calendar and tour deal, April.

155
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,880
So when were you
 planning on telling us?

156
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,290
Come on, smile.

157
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,950
Tonight.

158
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,840
Jeffrey still has to
 lock up the applications

159
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,230
for the promotional tour.

160
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,780
Hey, come on, all right?

161
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,280
How did you know?

162
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,400
Jeffrey just signed
 the contract today.

163
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,300
Jeffrey told me
 last night in bed.

164
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,600
I don't believe it.

165
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,430
Well, believe it.

166
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,020
Oh my god, you
 really are a bitch.

167
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,250
Yeah, well, a girl's got to
 do what a girl's got to do.

168
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,040
Even sleeping with your
 best friend's boyfriend?

169
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,270
Quite the coincidence, April.

170
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,010
Your boyfriend happens
 to be our manager.

171
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,610
Sleeping your way
 to the top there, June?

172
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,780
You know, April has run
 the show for a little too long

173
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,480
now.

174
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,630
It's time we did things my way.

175
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,620
But June, April only has
 our best interests at heart.

176
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,680
Spoken like a true virgin.

177
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,470
Pfft.

178
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,320
You leave the virgin--

179
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,460
I mean May-- out of this.

180
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,350
This is between you and me.

181
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,180
Well, I don't think
 you've got what it takes.

182
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:25,960
Try me.

183
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,660
Come on, May.

184
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,760
Let's get out of here.

185
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,490
I never get to have any fun.

186
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,190
Come on.

187
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,410
I'll buy you some
 candy, all right?

188
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,520
You're crazy.

189
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,980
If you think that
 sleeping with Jeffrey

190
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,780
is going to give you control
 over the Bikini Team,

191
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,810
you're wrong.

192
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,930
Then how come he's considering
 my topless calendar idea?

193
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,830
What?

194
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,910
That's right.

195
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,580
He seems to think that the
 Three Seasons Girls Go Topless

196
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,940
would be a number one seller.

197
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,980
Well, Jeffrey is no fool.

198
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,190
He knows the reason we're
 so popular is because we

199
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,780
won't take our tops off.

200
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,180
Well, then, I guess you
 haven't seen our recent sales

201
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,560
figures lately, have you?

202
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,620
Down by 20%.

203
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,430
I don't care what
 the sales figures say.

204
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:03,570
We have an image to protect.

205
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,330
And we owe it to our fans.

206
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,700
Yeah, well, our fans
 want to see us naked.

207
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,260
And I'm the kind of
 girl who likes to give

208
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,420
the guys what they want.

209
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,440
Well, that's what
 everybody says.

210
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,140
Shut up.

211
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,130
Now just outside

212
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,630
of Pig Hollow is
 that little haunted

213
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,540
area they all call Ghost Gulch.

214
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,610
Things have been pretty quiet
 around Ghost Gulch lately--

215
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,030
maybe too quiet.

216
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,420
Wake up, Pappy.

217
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,290
Things ain't going
 to be quiet for long,

218
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,650
not with that ghost
 running around.

219
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,280
Can't you keep quiet?

220
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,310
I'm trying to read here.

221
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,180
Here's to you, you old ghost.

222
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,890
Come on, let's
 get out of here.

223
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,310
This place gives me the creeps.
 - Me, too.

224
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,010
Let's go.

225
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,940
Boy, that Missy Sue

226
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,710
sure knows how to work a gun.

227
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,390
Guess I shouldn't be
 talking about Pappy's

228
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,290
little girl like that.

229
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,750
Scared of a little
 ghost, are ye?

230
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,210
How about this?

231
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,460
We'll
 be seeing a whole lot more

232
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,800
of Missy Sue as this
 story goes along,

233
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,450
and I do mean a whole lot more.

234
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,880
Daggonit.

235
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,420
Got off with a mess of chickens.

236
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,550
That dang ghost is going
 to cost us this farm.

237
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,950
Oh.

238
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,250
I have to take another bath.

239
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,190
That's two this week.

240
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:08,240
If the Good Lord meant
 for us to wear clothes,

241
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,010
you wouldn't have
 been born butt naked.

242
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:20,310
Ghost or no ghost, Pappy better
 get them dang showers fixed.

243
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:23,750
I'm tired of bathing
 in this here creek.

244
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,970
You never know what nasty
 critters might be watching you.

245
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,340
Now not too far away

246
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,110
from that creek was
 an old house that got

247
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,020
bought up by some young feller.

248
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,280
Folks say he was an
 artist, but most folks

249
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,260
just called him a hippie freak.

250
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,480
Because it takes a whole
 lot of drugs to make someone

251
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,160
buy a house right
 next door to a ghost.

252
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,820
Wow, if I could only put
 a face on a haunting voice.

253
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,060
Could that be you,
 my spirit goddess?

254
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,710
It is you I've come here to see.

255
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:56,280
Whoa.

256
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,230
How can a mere mortal be
 worthy of such beauty?

257
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,260
Mister, you talk like
 you're out of your head,

258
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,370
but you sure are cute.

259
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,830
Here's the reason they

260
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,380
call this place Ghost Gulch.

261
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,700
You ever hear of a
 haunted tepee before?

262
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,090
Now you have.

263
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,110
This here's the place of old
 Crazy Joe, an old Indian dead

264
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,940
these many years past.

265
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:35,740
His horrifying screams
 still fill the air.

266
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,640
Yep.

267
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,490
Unfortunately for that
 old artist hippie boy,

268
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,670
it was all just a dream.

269
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,350
But someday, if his
 dream was to come true,

270
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:00,210
he'll soon be
 painting a masterpiece

271
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,370
dedicated to Missy Sue.

272
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,660
Sue, my sweet, soon,
 it'll be more than a dream.

273
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,130
Well, after that dream,

274
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,470
I can think of two things
 he's going to be painting.

275
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,820
Shoot, some boys just
 have all the luck.

276
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,170
Oh!

277
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:18,870
I don't know.

278
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:23,000
It's-- it's rain-- it's raining.

279
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,370
Pa, I had to take a bath
 in that dang creek again.

280
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,740
When are you going
 to fix that shower?

281
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,440
Daggonit!

282
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,200
That dang ghost
 does it to me again.

283
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,550
Where's my jug?

284
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:38,600
Taking your moonshine ain't
 all that fool ghost has done.

285
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,240
'Cause of him, the cows
 don't want to give no milk

286
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,510
and the chickens don't
 want to lay no eggs.

287
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,110
Since he started
 all this fussing,

288
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,700
we ain't been able
 to make a dime.

289
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:52,220
I mean, for years now, he
 ain't bother us none, you know?

290
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,330
And now things are just
 disappearing right and left.

291
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,380
Well, that ain't all.

292
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,570
Them bank people done
 come around this morning.

293
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,390
Before I could
 run them off, they

294
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,420
just took some of the chickens.

295
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,290
Here's--

296
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,810
here's-- here's one of them yet.

297
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,830
Getting drunk ain't
 going to solve nothing.

298
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,200
Well, I ain't trying
 to solve nothing.

299
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,300
I'm just trying to
 get a little drink.

300
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,430
Pa, I'm tired of being
 the only one around here who

301
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,910
gives a dang about this place.

302
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,340
I care.

303
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,830
Pa, if we don't
 do something fast,

304
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,370
we're going to lose
 Ghost Gulch for good.

305
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,950
What are those two
 pathetic losers in for?

306
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,010
Oh, I caught them with a
 load of illegal moonshine

307
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,130
up near Ghost Gulch.

308
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,330
Ugh, must you do that?

309
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,050
Yep.

310
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,740
Well, let's get down
 to business, shall we?

311
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,550
Well, shoot.

312
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,630
It's your party,
 Mr. Bank President.

313
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,010
I'm just along for the ride.

314
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,860
The deed to Ghost Gulch,
 have your men found it?

315
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,900
No.

316
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,180
Did find a couple
 of chickens, though.

317
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,140
Ghost must've scared them off.

318
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,410
That and the old man's daughter,
 she's pretty good shot.

319
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,000
She doesn't suspect, does she?

320
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,020
Calm yourself.

321
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,840
My boys stuck to the
 back taxes story.

322
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,320
Far as she knows, that deed's
 still hidden safe and sound.

323
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,300
Well, you know, it
 ain't no big secret

324
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,210
in this part of the country that
 whoever holds the deed to Ghost

325
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,580
Gulch automatically becomes
 legal owner of the land.

326
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,510
And maybe somebody
 just found it.

327
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,040
No.

328
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,470
This land is perfect
 for my needs.

329
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,750
There's a deal
 with the government

330
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,140
already in the works.

331
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,170
They have got to find it.

332
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,150
Well, you've got
 to find yourself some

333
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,510
new idiots 'cause
 those old idiots

334
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:47,070
ain't going back there no more.

335
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,810
Don't tell me.

336
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,910
Because of the ghost, right?

337
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,320
You hillbillies
 are so predictable.

338
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,960
Watch yourself.

339
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
This hillbilly's got a gun.

340
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,810
Oh, we'll find
 the deed all right.

341
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,710
And I will be a
 millionaire, and Ghost

342
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,480
Gulch will become
 the government's

343
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,540
newest nuclear dumping site.

344
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:28,270
Uh-huh.

345
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:30,730
Yes, April.

346
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,070
No, no, it will
 never happen again.

347
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,870
I promise, April.

348
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,730
And don't worry about May.

349
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,480
She's OK.

350
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,700
She just doesn't like it
 when you and June are upset.

351
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:48,580
Oh, god.

352
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,580
Oh-- oh, god,
 something just came up.

353
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,870
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

354
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,490
Bye bye.

355
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,190
Hi.

356
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:57,890
Hi.

357
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,980
Well, that ghost don't seem
 to have hurt your appetite none.

358
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:39,870
Move over, boy.

359
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,400
Lord almighty, let it be there.

360
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:02,060
The deed to Ghost Gulch
 has been here for years.

361
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,590
I knew them bank people was
 looking for more back taxes.

362
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,580
They want our ranch.

363
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,830
You see anything
 up here, Bob Bob?

364
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,530
Nope.

365
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,640
How long we got
 to stay here anyway?

366
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,050
I'm getting scared.

367
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,550
Until we find
 that piece of paper

368
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,010
that the Sheriff or Mr.
 Snively are looking for.

369
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,870
I'm starting to
 itch something awful.

370
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,970
Well, that's
 just too dang bad.

371
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,140
If we don't find
 that deed, we're

372
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,230
going to be going back to jail.

373
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,430
Now I'm starting to itch, too.

374
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,160
Oh, the girl ain't got it.

375
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,100
Where did you get these leaves?

376
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:01,800
Over there.

377
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,430
One
 thing about the snooping

378
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:06,520
business, it don't pay
 to hide in poison oak.

379
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,100
We got so itchy, scratchy,
 we done left our binoculars

380
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,920
and moonshine behind.

381
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,020
Oh, I guess we'll never learn.

382
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,230
Drop Mr. Fuzzy or you're dead.

383
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,660
He's dropped.

384
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,360
He's dropped.

385
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,570
I'd forget I ever
 saw that if I was you.

386
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,300
Of course.

387
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,950
Now could you just put
 that thing away and attend

388
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,080
to the matter at hand?

389
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,960
What's on your mind, Snively?

390
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,880
The deed, of course.

391
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,290
Have those drunken idiots
 come up with anything?

392
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,100
Nope.

393
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,100
Because if I lose that deed,
 there will be hell to pay!

394
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,880
Hey, Jeb.

395
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,920
Keep an eye out for
 your sister, will you?

396
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:20,070
I ought to tan your hide.

397
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,840
Oh, come on, Missy Sue.

398
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,690
We didn't mean nothing by it.

399
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,690
And you better let me hold that
 bottle there because that stuff

400
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,680
is flammable.

401
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,500
Keep your grubby
 paws off of there.

402
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,960
And you, no more
 of this fancy book

403
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,200
learning until we
 find that deed.

404
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,580
Um, Missy Sue, it'll turn up.

405
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,900
He just done forgotten
 and put it somewhere else,

406
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,470
or that ghost took it.

407
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,860
You two just don't
 understand, do you?

408
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,530
Somebody's after Ghost
 Gulch, and it ain't no spook!

409
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,350
Well, it sounds like a spook.

410
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,250
Far out, man.

411
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,150
How many bikinis can they own?

412
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,930
There's more!

413
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,630
I had to ask.

414
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,090
You better call, you bastard.

415
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:49,440
June, come
 on, we're late.

416
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,150
Well, Jeffrey, I
 told you I wouldn't

417
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,980
stop until I get what I wanted.

418
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,600
Maybe you'll believe
 me after this.

419
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,220
Coming!

420
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,510
June, have you
 seen the itinerary?

421
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,210
Oh, yeah.

422
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:05,860
It's right here.

423
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,250
Ah, great.

424
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,220
'Cause you know, we wouldn't
 get very far without this now,

425
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,090
would we?
 - Nope.

426
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,040
Good, because my sense
 of direction really sucks.

427
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,210
Now what that city

428
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,510
boy didn't know was that sneaky
 June done switched the maps.

429
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,820
I do believe that girl
 needs a good licking

430
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,910
to straighten her act up right.

431
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,840
I'm sorry, folks.

432
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,660
I just got a mental
 picture in my head.

433
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,400
You know what they
 say about bad girls.

434
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,380
This isn't over yet.

435
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,190
I can still ruin
 your precious tour.

436
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:02,910
Call me.

437
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,530
June.

438
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,470
PS, you'll be sorry.

439
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,700
I don't get it.

440
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,910
Them binoculars was right here.

441
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,080
I'm not saying

442
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,180
I'm a superstitious fella.

443
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,130
But something down deep
 told me that that ghost

444
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:40,230
of Crazy Joe done stole our
 moonshine and our binoculars.

445
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,610
What the ghost needs them
 for, well, we don't know.

446
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:44,440
But we're going to
 try and find out.

447
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,450
I've got it.

448
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:54,360
I wouldn't sneak up on
 me like that if I was you.

449
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,190
You're lucky you
 didn't get plugged.

450
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:57,800
Put that down.

451
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,660
While you were sleeping,
 I came up with a solution

452
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,030
to our little problem,
 in case our drunken

453
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:05,100
friends fail in their mission.

454
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,400
We've been
 driving for hours.

455
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,850
I don't want to be late for
 the first stop on the tour.

456
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,390
You sure we're not lost?

457
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,830
April, relax, all right?

458
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:20,740
I've been following this
 map, and according to this,

459
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,430
we should be reaching--

460
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,130
Pig Hollow?

461
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,690
Is this legal?

462
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,730
Extremely legal.

463
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,120
Looks like Ghost Gulch has been
 having some financial problems

464
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,810
as of late.

465
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:39,880
Lucky for me, I still have
 connections at the IRS.

466
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,930
Figures you'd be in tight
 with that bunch of jackals.

467
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:48,250
By the time our little farm
 girl figures a way to pay up,

468
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:53,050
Ghost Gulch will become the
 very next Three Mile Island.

469
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,560
I don't get this.

470
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,690
I mean, this map
 says we shouldn't

471
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,580
be anywhere near Pig Hollow.

472
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,880
But we are, and according
 to my calculations,

473
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,540
that puts us about six
 hours behind schedule.

474
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,550
You know, I can't prove
 this, but I'll bet you

475
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,170
have something to do with this.

476
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,060
Still holding a grudge.

477
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,940
Excuse me, guys.

478
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,640
All right.

479
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,140
Speaking of holding it, maybe we
 all should make a little visit

480
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,130
to the woods, huh?

481
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,790
Well, you guys go on ahead.

482
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,330
I have something I have
 to take care of first.

483
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,250
Here, careful.

484
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,020
Careful, careful, careful.

485
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,120
All right, you
 two go over there,

486
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,520
and I'll see you guys
 in a little bit, OK?

487
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,810
Yes, I understand
 how you feel.

488
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:59,760
I know the calendar and the
 tour are a package deal.

489
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,500
But they must have
 broken down somewhere.

490
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,970
That's all I can think of.

491
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,650
Look, I promise you they'll
 make their next gig.

492
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,110
Yes, sir, I know.

493
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,610
Yes, thousands of dollars.

494
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,900
Don't worry.

495
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,890
You can count on me.

496
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,510
God, god.

497
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,320
What have I done?

498
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,340
All right, try it now.

499
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,770
No go.

500
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,350
All right, I'm
 no mechanic, but it

501
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:48,890
looks to me like
 someone has thrown

502
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:52,240
a monkey wrench in the works.

503
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,070
That sounds awful.

504
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,970
I don't think I
 can go another step.

505
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:00,670
Yes, you can.

506
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,800
Come on, you can do it, OK?

507
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,500
We've walked over
 eight miles already.

508
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,830
There's still no sign
 of intelligent life.

509
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:12,090
I know.

510
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,120
It's going to be dark.

511
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,150
What?

512
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,110
You guys afraid of
 a little exercise?

513
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,760
I knew it.

514
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,020
Knew what?

515
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,910
You switched the map.

516
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,560
And then when we
 were in the woods,

517
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,420
you fixed the van
 so it wouldn't run.

518
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:29,680
Why, April, I would
 have to be crazy to do

519
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,870
something like that.

520
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:32,400
Oh, crazy with jealousy maybe.

521
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,100
All right, girls.

522
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,330
Girls, just stop it, all right?

523
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:35,530
Fighting won't solve anything.

524
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,160
I think I hear something.

525
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,930
That sounds like a horse.

526
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,800
There must
 be a farm nearby.

527
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,000
I'll deal with you later.

528
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:13,800
Oh, gentle beauty, why
 has thou forsaken me?

529
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,810
Give me a sign, any sign
 that you still exist.

530
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,640
Oh, thank you.

531
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,180
Thank you.

532
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,150
You'll see.

533
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,340
You won't be sorry.

534
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,560
I dedicate this
 masterpiece to you.

535
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:10,160
What is that?

536
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,280
I don't know.

537
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,630
It sounds like Indian
 drums or something.

538
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,220
Well, it certainly isn't
 Metallica now, is it?

539
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,990
Well, whatever it is, we
 can't let it slow us down,

540
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,710
so let's keep moving.

541
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,340
Hey, excuse me.

542
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,670
You have a death wish, Mister?

543
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,600
Uh, look, don't
 shoot, all right?

544
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,180
Our vehicle broke down just
 a few miles back up the road,

545
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,690
and we just need
 to use your phone.

546
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,170
Well, it looks
 like you out of luck

547
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,580
because we ain't got no phone.

548
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,930
Um, OK, then can you tell
 us where the closest phone

549
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,370
within walking distance is?

550
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,120
Nope.

551
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,630
Nope?

552
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:51,110
There ain't no closest phone.

553
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,110
That would be about
 25 miles into town

554
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,330
at the sheriff's office.

555
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,220
Uh, well, would you mind
 giving us a ride then?

556
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:57,980
I wouldn't mind.

557
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,680
Ah, great.

558
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,700
Hands back up!

559
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,010
I said I wouldn't mind.

560
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,650
I didn't say nothing about
 having no automobile.

561
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,240
All right, look.

562
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,750
Our next appearance
 is in three days.

563
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:11,160
And if we miss another
 gig, we are history.

564
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,880
So isn't there any way that
 you could help us, please?

565
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,960
Well, mister, maybe we
 can work something out.

566
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,470
Ain't nothing I
 could do about it.

567
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,570
Something spooked
 them out there.

568
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:26,430
You got a gun.

569
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,870
Why don't you use it?

570
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,070
You can't
 do that, Snively.

571
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,750
Why not?

572
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,990
You're the Sheriff, aren't you?

573
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,690
Yeah.

574
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:38,660
Them boys said they'd
 rather serve their time

575
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,990
than help you out.

576
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,460
And they've got
 about 15 hours to go.

577
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,220
You can try to convince
 them after that.

578
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,840
Boys, I'm going to make you
 an offer you can't refuse.

579
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,370
The only way

580
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:01,610
Missy Sue could help these folks
 was to put them up for a night.

581
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:04,070
Although she done put them in
 the ritziest accommodations

582
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,230
available, them
 city folks didn't

583
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:08,080
seem to appreciate it none.

584
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,170
What time is it?

585
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,110
I don't know.

586
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,850
It's way too early.

587
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,100
Quit hogging my hay.

588
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:27,280
David, your hair is so matted.

589
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,850
Don't you ever wash it?

590
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,490
What was that thing in there?

591
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,580
It's just Bertha.

592
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,710
You folks sure are nervous.

593
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:50,950
Here, put these on.

594
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,490
And what is this?

595
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,480
The latest in hillbilly couture?

596
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,320
I think I'd rather
 wear my bikini.

597
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,430
Just put it on.

598
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,280
Ooh.

599
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,010
How chic.

600
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,920
I'm going to, you
 know, go over there.

601
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,750
Ain't you never change clothes
 in front of a woman before?

602
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,450
Oh, it's not that.

603
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:19,430
I just, you know, would
 prefer to change inside

604
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,580
if that's all right with you.

605
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,650
You all right down there, boy?

606
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,650
Yeah, I'm fine.

607
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:24,350
Thank you.

608
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,070
I'll just take these.

609
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,150
Oh, but mind Bertha.

610
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:29,970
She's a little feisty
 this time of year,

611
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:31,070
being it's mating
 season and all.

612
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,270
Run!

613
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,750
Run!

614
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,200
Run!

615
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,340
Come on, April, call.

616
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:40,100
If that June screws up the
 calendar deal, I'll kill her!

617
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,800
Pappy!

618
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,260
All right, look,
 Missy Sue, I can

619
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,340
explain the whole thing here.

620
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,230
Oh.

621
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,880
Are-- are-- are these
 the people that are

622
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,020
going to help us find the deed?

623
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,040
They don't look
 none too smart, Pappy.

624
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,470
No.

625
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:06,100
They may not look like
 much, but they all we got.

626
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,000
This is all we got?

627
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,470
They say you can't

628
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,950
teach an old dog new tricks.

629
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,570
This must be true, because as
 soon as we got out of jail,

630
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,390
we was back in business again.

631
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,200
Woo yeah, we got out just
 in time for a new shift.

632
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,990
The moonshine business.

633
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,540
But what we didn't know was
 that Snively and the Sheriff

634
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,540
was back in business, too--

635
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:39,310
our business-- and ready to
 put us back in jail to get us

636
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:42,270
to agree to help them with their
 evil plan to steal Ghost Gulch.

637
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,780
Hey, you think old
 Snively's going to make

638
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,920
us go back to Ghost Gulch?

639
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,990
As long as we make
 our moonshine delivery,

640
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,920
I don't care.

641
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,570
Well,
 we finally lost them,

642
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:52,280
but we got clean away.

643
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,020
At least, that's what
 they led us to believe.

644
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,660
Dang, there goes Snively.

645
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,240
He done sniffed us out
 faster than a hound dog.

646
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,740
I'd like to see old
 Snively's face right now.

647
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,590
Me, too.

648
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,990
I'd like to see him
 make us do anything.

649
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,890
Me, too.

650
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,310
My, my, my.

651
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,860
Look what the
 Sheriff dragged in.

652
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,280
Snively, these boys
 were too easy to find.

653
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,710
After they lost us, I
 just went back to the bar

654
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,140
and waited for them there.

655
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,410
They're going to have
 to do some more time.

656
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,330
But you know, since this
 is their second offense

657
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:15,330
and they did try to flee and
 elude an officer of the law,

658
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:19,540
I'm afraid they're going to be
 in here for a long, long time.

659
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,690
Well, you know, I
 might be out of office

660
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:23,910
before these boys
 see the light of day.

661
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,090
Unless, of course, we
 can work something out.

662
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,220
Back up in the hills,

663
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,310
old Crazy Joe was back
 to being crazy again.

664
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:37,130
He was burning up stuff
 he'd stolen from some folks.

665
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,530
I hope nothing is
 important in them papers.

666
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:54,290
I totally feel
 your pain, my beauty.

667
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,620
Soon.

668
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,400
Soon, I'll take it all away.

669
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,920
Wow, this is,
 like, totally good.

670
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:07,880
Well, our horse can't make it.

671
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,220
She's too old.

672
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,300
If'n you go by foot, you better
 take along a first aid kit.

673
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,190
Them hills are deadly.

674
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,360
Look, I don't
 want to get killed.

675
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,760
I just want to find a phone.

676
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,400
Well, the mail truck
 comes in about three days.

677
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,800
You can probably
 get a lift then.

678
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,710
That's three days.

679
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,610
We have a gig in two days.

680
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,610
So we really aren't
 going to make it.

681
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,110
They'll have to cancel our tour.

682
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,360
Isn't that what
 you wanted, June?

683
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,440
What?

684
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,880
Now you can do that topless
 calendar all by yourself.

685
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,740
Because without
 this tour, the Three

686
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,700
Seasons Bikini Team is through.

687
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,820
But I didn't mean for--
 well, really, I just--

688
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,560
Come on, Pa.

689
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,100
Let's go find that deed.

690
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,880
All right.

691
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,380
Well, you know, we need
 a shovel or anything?

692
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,450
But you've got to believe me.

693
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,570
I didn't mean for
 this to happen.

694
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,280
I ne--

695
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,680
I ne-- I've n--

696
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,150
never met a girl
 like you before.

697
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,490
And I hope you
 never will again.

698
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,660
Come on, let's go for a walk.

699
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,920
Damn that June.

700
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,520
If they mess up the
 tour, I'm ruined.

701
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,690
If I only had a clue
 where they were.

702
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,270
Do you think the
 others will miss us?

703
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:49,110
Nah.

704
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:53,530
Missy Sue is just looking
 for that stupid old deed.

705
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,230
But isn't that important?

706
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,580
You could lose the farm.

707
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,800
I know this may
 sound crazy, but I

708
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,010
don't much care about farming.

709
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:05,200
This is what I care about.

710
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,000
But this is your home.

711
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,130
You should care about it.

712
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,510
Don't gets me wrong.

713
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,360
I love this place.

714
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,470
It's just Missy Sue
 always been the one who

715
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,550
gets the work done around here.

716
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:21,360
I just always have
 bigger dreams, I guess.

717
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,060
I think I've
 found my Mr. Right.

718
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,660
Just where were
 you last night?

719
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,150
Well, I can explain
 everything, Missy Sue.

720
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,290
And where were you, May?

721
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,660
David and I were
 worried sick about you.

722
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,590
Well--

723
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:53,550
I don't suppose anyone
 was worried about me.

724
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,420
Well?

725
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,900
Well, Jeb and I were together,
 if you know what I mean.

726
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,600
You mean--

727
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,980
Yeah, another
 virgin bites the dust?

728
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,590
Goddangit!

729
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,520
Make that two virgins.

730
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,350
Boy, I was starting to
 worry about you, reading

731
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,180
all that frou frou stuff.

732
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,560
Now that we got all that out
 of the way, let's get going.

733
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,220
We got a deed to find.

734
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,370
Ahem.

735
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,080
What is it, June?

736
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,320
I'm sorry, April,
 for everything.

737
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,970
Did you just say
 what I think you said?

738
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,250
If you give me another
 chance, I promise I won't let

739
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,100
you or the group down again.

740
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,280
You mean I got my
 best friend back?

741
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,070
For good this time.

742
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,280
All right, writing up
 all this crybaby stuff.

743
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,010
We got work to do.

744
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:49,940
Come on, everybody.

745
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,010
Pappy's going to fix the shower.

746
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:14,180
Crazy Joe finally found

747
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,470
a use for those binoculars.

748
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,930
And one thing he
 learned is that city

749
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,430
girls get dirty in a hurry.

750
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,930
And ain't we
 the lucky ones for it?

751
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,220
Pig Hollow?

752
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:47,680
Oh, wait a minute.

753
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,170
That's where they went.

754
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,740
Boys, why don't
 you tell Mr. Snively

755
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,280
what you told me this morning?

756
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,470
I'm breathless
 with anticipation.

757
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,720
Oh, well, um, uh--

758
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,510
We'd be willing to help you
 if you'd talk to the Sheriff

759
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:15,160
about getting us out of here.

760
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,170
I could do that.

761
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:19,900
Not only do I need you
 to look for the deed,

762
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,090
but the Sheriff needs your
 help with a little plan

763
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:23,410
I've devised.

764
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,030
You boys think you're up to it?

765
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,350
Uh-huh.

766
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:28,780
Excellent.

767
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,560
Now this is what
 I want you to do.

768
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,990
It didn't take Snively

769
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,700
long to figure out he
 needed someone else

770
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,970
to do his dirty work for him.

771
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:43,870
Hold it right
 there, flower boy.

772
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:46,760
I thought I'd find you up here.

773
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:51,560
You that wacky artist bought the
 place that borders Ghost Gulch.

774
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,300
I done some checking
 on you, son.

775
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,150
I've come to find out
 that your craziness

776
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,320
ain't all in your head.

777
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:00,680
It might have something do with
 some wacky little weeds grow

778
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,690
so fine up here.

779
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:04,280
Now if'n you don't
 want your place

780
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,800
to be subject to a
 search, I just suggest you

781
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,050
cooperate with me and the boys.

782
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:11,630
Get your hands behind your head.

783
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:14,040
Joe Bob, Bob Bob, search.

784
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,230
Things have never been
 the same since Woodstock.

785
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:32,760
If'n you want your little
 secret to stay safe with me,

786
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,430
you're going to have to
 do me a little favor, son.

787
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:55,940
Important.

788
00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:00,700
Come to the old willows
 place right away.

789
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,220
I didn't know anybody
 around here could write.

790
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:06,920
I wonder who it is.

791
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,590
Please, it's not ready for
 your eyes yet, my darling.

792
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:56,030
What the devil is going on?

793
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:58,690
And just who are you anyway?

794
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:04,050
Just a humble artist in
 awe of your magnificence.

795
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,790
Look, mister, I don't
 understand no French,

796
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,060
so if you want to
 talk to me, you're

797
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,090
going to have to speak English.

798
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:16,950
I have something of great
 importance to show you.

799
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:18,060
Can't it wait?

800
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,580
Because I got something
 to show you, too.

801
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:21,480
Really?

802
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,180
Really.

803
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:30,990
Now, we shall create
 art in its truest form.

804
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:31,690
Oh, baby!

805
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,050
As much is it
 saddens me, my dearest,

806
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:49,130
I have been forced against
 my will to give this to you.

807
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:49,830
Hm?

808
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,540
Internal Revenue Service.

809
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,530
Notice of repossession.

810
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:10,030
Property tax due, $25,000.

811
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,590
That does not sound good.

812
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:17,900
Pig Hollow, here I come.

813
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,100
Although I can't prove
 it, something in my gut

814
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,710
tells me that Snively
 is behind all this.

815
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:32,980
That's the president
 of the bank you

816
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:33,970
were telling us about, right?

817
00:48:33,970 --> 00:48:35,100
Mm-hmm.

818
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:38,140
And I'd be willing to bet that
 old Roscoe is in on it, too.

819
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:40,100
Maybe you better
 call the police.

820
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,830
Roscoe is the police.

821
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:43,990
We ain't going to
 get no help there.

822
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,750
We owe that money
 fair and square.

823
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:49,520
Now they just sped up the
 process a little, that's all.

824
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,570
The South is
 going to rise again.

825
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:54,900
Pa, go put that away.

826
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:55,600
OK.

827
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:00,360
What can we do to help?

828
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,760
For starters, keep
 looking for the deed.

829
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,260
If we can find it
 before they do,

830
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,660
we might stand a better chance.

831
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,130
Well then, we have just
 looked everywhere for it.

832
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:10,020
I can think of one
 place we haven't looked.

833
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:10,770
You mean?

834
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:11,700
Yes.

835
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,800
Crazy Joe's.

836
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,120
Crazy Joe's?

837
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,260
Yes, over yonder.

838
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,130
That's right.

839
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:23,740
Tonight only, the
 girls appear topless.

840
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:27,260
And you get first
 distribution on the photos.

841
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,530
Location?

842
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:30,340
Well, that's still
 a little hush hush.

843
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,890
But I can tell you this much.

844
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:34,750
It's in a town
 called Pig Hollow.

845
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:35,900
Yeah.

846
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,800
Listen, I'll call you
 back with all the details.

847
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,500
Ciao.

848
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:42,410
Why did that
 Sheriff have to go

849
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:43,700
leave us out here by ourselves?

850
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,080
You see anything yet?

851
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,980
Not yet.

852
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:50,010
There ain't no
 such thing as ghosts.

853
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,890
There ain't no such
 thing as ghosts.

854
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,820
So is this Crazy Joe
 guy after your property?

855
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:09,690
Well, according to Pappy, an
 Indian by the name of Crazy Joe

856
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:12,060
was the original
 owner of Ghost Gulch.

857
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,970
When he died, he
 wrote in his will

858
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,800
that his tepee was
 never to be torn down.

859
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,480
Why?

860
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,900
In case he came back
 from the dead, of course.

861
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,440
And from the looks
 of things, he has.

862
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,920
So that's why they
 call this place Ghost Gulch.

863
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,380
And whoever possesses the
 original deed to the property

864
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,200
becomes the legal
 owner of the land.

865
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,330
Well, maybe that's why
 this Crazy Joe rumor is still

866
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,550
around, is to keep
 people like Snively

867
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:37,320
from trying to steal the deed.

868
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,600
It ain't no rumor.

869
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,300
It's real.

870
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,260
Did you hear what I heard?

871
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,100
Yeah.

872
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,210
You know what that means.

873
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:55,230
We run like hell?

874
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:55,930
Yep.

875
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:02,150
Jimmy, baby.

876
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:02,850
Yeah, I know.

877
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,840
I'm having a bad
 connection up here.

878
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:06,720
Having trouble
 with my cell phone.

879
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,440
But listen, the
 place, Ghost Gulch.

880
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,840
The time, sundown.

881
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:14,670
We're having us
 a bikini hoedown.

882
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:17,490
Yeah,
 talk to you later.

883
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:30,510
June, baby, if this topless
 idea of yours works,

884
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:32,550
I might just spare
 your miserable life.

885
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:41,050
Where the hell is
 it, Pig Hollow?

886
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:54,880
Bingo.

887
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:09,260
Girls, have I got
 a surprise for you.

888
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,920
This is maddening.

889
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,620
Yep.

890
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:14,830
How could you let them
 lock themselves in there?

891
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:15,790
Did.

892
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:19,360
Obviously, they got
 the keys from somewhere.

893
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,860
Yep, they got it from me.

894
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:23,170
But I didn't let them have it.

895
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,610
They had to work real hard.

896
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,340
They even threatened Mr. Fuzzy.

897
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:38,790
Maybe there is something to
 this ghost thing after all.

898
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:43,890
It's about time I paid
 little Missy Sue a visit.

899
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:46,240
She must be in need of
 some financial advice.

900
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:57,120
I don't know which is
 scarier, you or the ghost.

901
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,510
You need to ask?

902
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,530
You boys got room
 for one more in there?

903
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:09,570
Two of us?

904
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,460
So what if my career is over?

905
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,760
So what if my best friend
 slept with my boyfriend?

906
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,390
So what if--

907
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:39,000
What if I join you?

908
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:39,700
David.

909
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:42,040
No, April, please
 don't try to stop me.

910
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:42,740
But--

911
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,810
You know, I don't know if it's
 being out here in the country

912
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:48,380
air or running from a ghost, but
 I just have to say this to you.

913
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,900
I think I'm in love with you.

914
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,740
What?

915
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,550
I said I love you.

916
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:00,780
It's about damn time.

917
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:12,400
Hold it right there, city boy!

918
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,590
Don't shoot.

919
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,440
What do you want?

920
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,290
I'll give you anything.

921
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,490
My car?

922
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:18,930
My house?

923
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:20,060
My credit cards?

924
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,180
You with the IRS?

925
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,570
IRS?

926
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:24,270
No.

927
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:25,170
No.

928
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:28,530
I'm with them.

929
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:29,910
Jeffrey?

930
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:31,200
You know this sneaky varmint?

931
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,480
Yeah.

932
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:34,190
I know him all right.

933
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:37,000
You want me to
 shoot him for you?

934
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,010
April.

935
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,960
Not just yet.

936
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,480
Let's see what he has to
 say for himself first.

937
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,620
All right.

938
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,770
But if'n you need me, I'll
 be just inside the house.

939
00:54:55,050 --> 00:55:00,540
Well, Jeffrey, to what do we
 owe the honor of your presence?

940
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:02,680
Let me tell you all about it.

941
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:14,110
Absolutely not.

942
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:14,810
No.

943
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:16,400
But you can't say no.

944
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,270
We've got a contract.

945
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:22,280
Well, contracts are
 made to be broken,

946
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,140
just like relationships.

947
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,590
April, sweetie, she
 means nothing to me.

948
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:29,400
Nothing.

949
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,120
Can it, Jeffrey.

950
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,100
Ow.

951
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:33,590
I could sue you for that.

952
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:38,330
Now, here's the deal.

953
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:42,670
We'll do your little
 hoedown on one condition.

954
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:43,370
Name it.

955
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:45,320
Baby, it's yours.

956
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,940
You tell him, May.

957
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,340
We keep 80%.

958
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:49,040
What?

959
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:49,760
You heard her.

960
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,830
It's 80% or no deal, big boy.

961
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:54,530
All right.

962
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:56,360
All right, it's 80%.

963
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,830
That comes to--

964
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:05,740
$50,184.62.

965
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:06,440
No.

966
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,050
Well, that's
 enough money to pay

967
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:12,930
off the property taxes on Ghost
 Gulch, and plenty of money

968
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:13,630
for us.

969
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:20,450
Who knew taking our clothes
 off could be so rewarding?

970
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:21,240
Come on, girl.

971
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,190
We have a hoedown to put on.

972
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:22,890
Yee haw!

973
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,370
Oh, now we're looking good.

974
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:38,250
Yes, don't it, Pappy?

975
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:42,250
Oh, yeah.

976
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:53,720
Whoa.

977
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:00,210
Nice.

978
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:02,010
You did it.

979
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:02,710
Yeah.

980
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:09,300
We were
 planning to sleep it off safe

981
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,910
and sound in our
 little cozy jail cell,

982
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:14,030
away from the ghost and Snively.

983
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:17,130
But once again, fate was
 about to stick out a foot

984
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:17,970
and trip us up.

985
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:30,250
Mr. Fuzzy don't like
 people sneaking up on him.

986
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:36,460
My beauty, my beauty,
 I'm going to save her.

987
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:38,890
Please, hear me out.

988
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,300
Wake up, boys.

989
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,950
Get a load of what
 we've got here.

990
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,060
You.

991
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,750
Who, me?

992
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,180
June.

993
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,220
You seen Miss June?

994
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,500
I seen them.

995
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,200
We got to save them together.

996
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,580
Are them girls in trouble?

997
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,900
Big trouble.

998
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,660
They're the ones I've been
 telling you about, Bob Bob.

999
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,570
If that Miss June or any of them
 Three Seasons girls in trouble,

1000
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,250
you can sure count on me.

1001
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,140
Come on, Sheriff
 Roscoe, what do you say?

1002
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:13,930
Haven't you done done enough
 for that low down skunk Snively?

1003
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,940
Please?

1004
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,720
Well,
 it looked like the hoedown

1005
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,100
was going to schedule.

1006
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,750
The Three Seasons
 girls were going

1007
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,130
to make enough money
 taking them off

1008
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,980
them tops to pay off the
 mortgage on Ghost Gulch

1009
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,990
and have enough money
 for themselves besides.

1010
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:32,830
Ah, that's some
 nice work if you can get it.

1011
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:37,300
Get on in here.

1012
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,640
Listen, you guys are
 going to love this.

1013
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:44,310
This whole topless
 thing, my idea.

1014
00:58:44,310 --> 00:58:46,410
I'm going to make
 you guys millions!

1015
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,250
Here we go, come on
 in here and get it.

1016
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:51,850
Jeb, get up in here.

1017
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:52,670
Go get it.

1018
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:53,370
Come on, honey.

1019
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:54,350
Let's drink one ourselves.

1020
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:55,050
Thank you, Pa.

1021
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:55,750
Now, here.

1022
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:09,410
The moment y'all
 been waiting for--

1023
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:14,110
the one, the only Three
 Seasons Bikini Team!

1024
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:32,010
What the hell?

1025
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:36,700
Who's there?

1026
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,440
I know someone's there.

1027
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,050
Show yourself, man.

1028
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:42,610
Please don't hurt me!

1029
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:43,550
Don't hurt me!

1030
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:35,770
Crazy Joe?

1031
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,550
Now you all don't
 pay me no never mind.

1032
01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:45,040
I ain't fixing to ruin
 your party or nothing.

1033
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,220
I just kind of fell off
 the wagon for a spell.

1034
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:50,600
I done must have hit my
 head pretty hard, too,

1035
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:54,500
because I've been whooping it up
 like a wild Indian ever since.

1036
01:01:54,500 --> 01:02:02,810
Don't you all
 have some partying to do?

1037
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:04,200
Well, get on with it then!

1038
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,240
So you ain't really Crazy Joe?

1039
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,610
You're about
 half right, ma'am.

1040
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:25,700
The name's Otis.

1041
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:32,690
Say, maybe you can help
 me with something here.

1042
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,160
Pa, it's the deed
 to Ghost Gulch.

1043
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:43,080
I tried to give it to that
 there fancy banker fella.

1044
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:44,520
He didn't seem interested in it.

1045
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,500
How about you?

1046
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,420
Where did you find it?

1047
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:51,670
Well, them fire water
 spirits can get a fella

1048
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:55,540
into a whole heap of trouble,
 like picking up things

1049
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:59,110
that don't belong to him.

1050
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:01,760
You know, I've found
 something else out there.

1051
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,730
Maybe that there will make you
 feel like you can straighten

1052
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:05,530
this one out for you.

1053
01:03:05,530 --> 01:03:09,220
It's that repossession thing,
 Pa, from the Internal Revenue

1054
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,350
Service.

1055
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:13,450
You might try asking that
 there banker fella about that.

1056
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:18,330
Just between me and you,
 I think that boy's crazy.

1057
01:03:18,330 --> 01:03:20,110
Y'all have a good time now.

1058
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:20,810
Bye.

1059
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:25,480
I'm the one that tore that up.

1060
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,190
But I thought you was
 in cahoots with Snively.

1061
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:29,900
Oh, not no more.

1062
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,810
Why, he made all that
 up about the IRS.

1063
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:35,030
Yeah, he even tried to
 fool me with it, too.

1064
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:37,300
But I know this boy
 doesn't do nothing legal.

1065
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:39,650
Why, he was just trying
 to scare you into having

1066
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,290
to sell your farm to him.

1067
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:44,240
Looks like he's got himself
 all scared straight now.

1068
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,470
You got anything to say
 for yourself, Snively?

1069
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:48,710
I do believe in spooks.

1070
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:50,370
I do believe in spooks.

1071
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:55,020
Bob Bob, come on, I'm going
 to need some help with this boy.

1072
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,440
That's a terrible
 looking thing, hey?

1073
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,860
Pitiful.

1074
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:03,470
My beauty, I
 finally finished it.

1075
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:06,580
This is how I
 envision your beauty.

1076
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:16,340
Mister, I don't know what
 your idea of beauty is,

1077
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:18,320
but if'n you're willing
 to settle for another roll

1078
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,960
in the hay, I'm all yours.

1079
01:04:27,330 --> 01:04:29,700
Oh-- oh-- oh my god.

1080
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:30,580
Don't-- don't.

1081
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:34,010
Oh god.

1082
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:34,710
Pa?

1083
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:35,490
What you're doing.

1084
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:36,190
Oh god.

1085
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:11,910
In the end, everything

1086
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:14,230
worked out just fine.

1087
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,650
Snively went to jail.

1088
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:18,360
Missy Sue and Pappy
 saved the farm.

1089
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:22,470
April, May, and June
 all found true love.

1090
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:25,980
Hey, even Joe Bob got laid.

1091
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:29,260
As for me, I'm no longer
 running moonshine.

1092
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,090
I'm the new Sheriff
 of Pig Hollow,

1093
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:35,950
a happy ending after
 all, except for old Roscoe,

1094
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:36,760
of course.

1095
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:42,000
It seems he and Mr. Fuzzy just
 were a little bit too close.

1096
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,650
Drop in and see him sometime.

1097
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:46,050
You can find him at the
 Pig Hollow Sanitarium.

1098
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:49,140
Well, visiting hours are from
 5:00 to 8:00 PM weekdays, 2:00

1099
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,430
to 8:00 PM on the weekends.

1100
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:53,700
Just remember, don't you
 be speeding if you're going

1101
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,040
there 'cause I'll be watching.
