00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:12,111
[women moaning]

2
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:32,365
[cartoony bouncing sounds]

3
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,679
[tearing sound]

4
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,510
- Oh my God,
I think he's going bald.

5
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:51,675
[women screaming]

6
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:54,720
[all screaming]

7
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:05,730
- I'm 20 years old,
and I'm losing all of my hair.

8
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,994
Every day,
it thins more and more.

9
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,007
My best friend Max says 
no one can even notice,

10
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,732
but I know that's not true.

11
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:16,071
If I was rich,
I could get a hair transplant

12
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:19,407
or one of those serious
Hollywood hairpieces.

13
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,003
But I'm not rich.

14
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,048
I'm bald.

15
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,606
Come on Growpecia,
I've waited the six months.

16
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:54,113
Start working.

17
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,114
I used to get all the girlies.

18
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:59,117
Now I barely get kitty cat
once a month.

19
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,278
I tried stopping my hair loss.

20
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,322
Nothing works.

21
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,254
This doesn't work either.

22
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:08,192
I need the brush Jack Nicholson
used in <i>Anger Management.</i>

23
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:09,694
That thing was incredible.

24
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:13,289
Come to think of it,
Jack Nicholson is incredible.

25
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,130
I'm gonna have to wear
a hat every day

26
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,762
for the rest of my life.

27
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,296
- Print my paper,
smoke my ten paper,

28
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,559
get to class.

29
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:50,795
- People will notice
you wore those pants last week.

30
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:55,574
- Good morning, little buddy.

31
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:57,473
Hey, is this-is this new
this thing your doing,

32
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,511
'cause it's working.

33
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,808
- Will you get out of here
with that stuff?

34
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,142
You're gonna stink up
my clothes.

35
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:04,046
- My shuttle's leaving
in five minutes.

36
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,381
Now, did you finish your paper?

37
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,317
- It's not due today.

38
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:11,653
- [laughs]

39
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,783
You wore those pants last week.

40
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,662
Well, hello, the B.

41
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,997
You coming to class today?

42
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,500
We got four hecklers for Psych.

43
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:25,732
- The B will be there.

44
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,709
Motherfucker.

45
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:41,579
- Ooh, I wish I'd slept
in here last night.

46
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:42,621
- Shh.

47
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:44,850
- Looking good, ladies.

48
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:46,084
Looking good.

49
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:54,028
- Max, I'm gonna kick your ass.

50
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:56,902
When'd you make these?

51
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,267
- Last night.

52
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,362
- What time?

53
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,737
- I don't know, like, 3:30.

54
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,036
Why, do you like them?

55
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:04,667
- They're exceptional.

56
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,009
Ladies, I really think
this is your best work.

57
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,140
- I can't believe
you're saying that.

58
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,480
When we made it,
we were practically passing out.

59
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:13,746
- I always told you,

60
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,584
a true artist
works best at night.

61
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:19,784
You guys are gonna be huge.

62
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,520
Trust me.

63
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,394
- Wait, have you come up
with your new internet idea yet?

64
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,524
Cynthia and I really need money
for our clothing line.

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,534
- I'm working on it.

66
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,694
- What's taking you so long?

67
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,737
- Oh, don't worry.

68
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:33,271
See, the subconscious part
of my brain

69
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:35,170
has been working overtime
the last three weeks,

70
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:38,404
so any minute now,
my idea is gonna pop.

71
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,275
- Everyone says you're a genius.

72
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,473
Why aren't you making any money,
genius?

73
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:43,742
- Oh, I will.

74
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:47,980
See, every man just needs
one great idea, one.

75
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,021
It's on the way.

76
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,055
- Hmm.

77
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,115
Well, when you come up with it,
we want to help.

78
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:54,784
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

79
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,886
- Shouldn't be a problem.

80
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,523
Ladies, it's the good things
that happen slowly.

81
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,590
It's the great things
that happen all at once.

82
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,693
Shuttle's leaving, two minutes.

83
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:09,865
- I kind of like him.

84
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:11,705
- I know.

85
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,439
I slept with him once.

86
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,242
- Really?

87
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,373
And how was he?

88
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,643
- Incredible.

89
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:19,776
The best male sex I've ever had.

90
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,821
- [laughs]

91
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:50,080
- Oh.

92
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,208
Unhand that dweeb.

93
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,219
Look at him; he's nothing.

94
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:57,017
Everybody, those guys
are probably gay.

95
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,827
- [extremely loud belching]

96
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,111
- Now, you get to class,
little buddy.

97
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,612
Go save the world.

98
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:33,425
[indistinct whispering]

99
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,475
- Look at his bald head.

100
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:54,012
Got no hair.

101
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,049
[laughter]

102
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,582
- I've got more hair
on my balls.

103
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,525
Hey, pal.

104
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,325
Got no hair.

105
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,815
- Let's make this quick.

106
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,691
Hello, operator?

107
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,234
Yes, I'm trying
to buy some security.

108
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,361
Yes, I'm very insecure.

109
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:53,098
Oh, you have some in stock.

110
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,139
Great.

111
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:56,368
No, no, no,
I'll take it now.

112
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,347
- Is everybody ready?

113
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,853
Is y'all motherfuckers ready?

114
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:09,888
Y'all gladiators?

115
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,186
We're gonna turn the heat up
in this motherfucker today!

116
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:13,225
Whoo!

117
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,692
Those are some big ass titties!

118
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:16,955
Little thirsty.

119
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,088
- I want to take
the morning after pill

120
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,962
before I go out at night.

121
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:23,501
That way,
I'll be ahead of the game.

122
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,059
Mm-hmm.

123
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,504
- What the fuck?

124
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,202
Make sure you ain't got no bomb
or nothing in this-bend over.

125
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,302
- Is cum fattening?

126
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:36,610
- I hope Coach partners me up
with Justin.

127
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:38,775
I just want to rub up
all against him.

128
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,678
- Good thing I told the coach.

129
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,655
- Turn it up.

130
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:45,691
Sit your ass down.

131
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:49,524
- I wonder if anyone knows I've
been with seven guys this week?

132
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,926
I think I have a problem.

133
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,557
- God, that girl's
giving herself a bad name.

134
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:57,899
She's blown, like, seven guys
in the last week.

135
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,530
But more importantly,
if I fail this class,

136
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,403
then I'll be kicked out
of school.

137
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,466
Someone's looking
at my bald spot.

138
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,273
- Yo, Max.

139
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,812
Yo, fuckin' Andy.

140
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,847
- What up, B?

141
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,143
Hey, made a new film.

142
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,581
We're gonna watch it tonight.

143
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,484
- Man, you know I love
this snuff film shit.

144
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,049
- Morning, everyone.

145
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,182
I have your papers with me,

146
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,158
and I'll be handing them out
at the end of class.

147
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,194
- How'd we do?

148
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,228
Did anyone pass?

149
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,263
Did anyone fail?

150
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,558
- Is my brother gay?

151
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:26,825
- You all did moderately well.

152
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,491
- Who had the highest grade?

153
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,933
Who had the lowest grade?

154
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,594
Make a meal out of a blowjob.

155
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:32,638
- Silence!

156
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:34,570
[flatulent sound]

157
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,574
- I'll eat your ass!
- Let me see your balls.

158
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,475
- A whore!
- I'll suck your dick, man.

159
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:41,740
- I promise you,
you will be ejected from my class

160
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:42,906
and expelled from the school.

161
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,074
- Fuck you!

162
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,119
- [belches loudly]

163
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:55,657
I do have talent,
and Max appreciates it.

164
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,723
I'm bald and out of school.

165
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,563
I officially have nothing
to live for.

166
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,626
- Not true.

167
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:07,298
For five grand, you can fuck
a retired porn star.

168
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,204
I've seen the website.

169
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,401
It's real.

170
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,535
- I don't think
you're listening to me.

171
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,341
I'm kicked out of school,
and I have no money.

172
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,938
- You know, maybe taking
some time off school

173
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:18,176
would be good for you.

174
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,481
Lat time I took a break,
I met Shirtless Cynthia.

175
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,454
Now my life is perfect.

176
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:25,319
- Maybe if you spent less time

177
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,359
organizing the destruction
of the class

178
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,223
and spent more time
doing your homework,

179
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,593
you wouldn't be
in this situation.

180
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,792
- Baby, you are so cute.

181
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,859
Come here.

182
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,531
- I wonder if they
fist each other?

183
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,301
- Hey, hey, Drew, huh?

184
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,774
Wake the fuck up, huh, buddy?

185
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:44,935
- I'm awake.

186
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:46,842
I was just thinking
about something important.

187
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:48,641
- What?
Lesbian duos?

188
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:50,204
- No.

189
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,250
I was thinking about
what I'm gonna tell my parents.

190
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,149
- Ah, fuck those clowns.

191
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,983
Man, those niggas
don't know you.

192
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,181
- Yeah, thanks the B.

193
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:59,588
But that's not gonna help me
right now.

194
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:03,017
- Hey, guys.

195
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,062
- What's up, O. B?

196
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,222
- You're late.

197
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:06,696
- What's wrong with Andy?

198
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:08,996
- Oh, he just got kicked out
of school,

199
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:10,035
and he's broke.

200
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,933
- So what's up
with your big internet idea?

201
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,596
- Soon.

202
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,163
Soon.

203
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,232
Come into this love, buddy.

204
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:19,106
- I'm going bald, O.B.

205
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,475
- So?

206
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,106
I had my first heart attack
while playing with myself.

207
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,844
Life's embarrassing.

208
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,409
- That's not so bad.

209
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:32,221
- My mom and her bridge club
found me.

210
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,349
- Woodsy.

211
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:34,393
- What?

212
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,293
- You don't have to worry
about your fucked up hair loss.

213
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,059
Man, they got this Japanese
nigga scientist, man.

214
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,066
This motherfucker
figured out a way

215
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,329
to make hair grow on your head

216
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,428
by using dead hair
from your anus.

217
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:48,200
- That doesn't help me.

218
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,707
- Well, it should.

219
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,505
- Ah, fuck it.

220
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,273
I'm a great guy
with a lot to offer.

221
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,405
If a girl
doesn't want to be with me

222
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,576
just because I have a few less
strands of hair on my head,

223
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:00,619
who needs her?

224
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,050
- Oh, Woodsy.

225
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,254
You like her?

226
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:11,728
- Yes.

227
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:13,822
And call me Andrew.

228
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:16,197
- Would you have sex with her?

229
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:19,965
- Of course I would.

230
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,837
I, Andrew Wood.

231
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,466
- That's my nigga.

232
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,601
- Motherfuckin' nigga.

233
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,009
- What the fuck?

234
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,775
- Hold up!

235
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,879
Where you going
in such a hurry?

236
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,148
Please don't
look at my hairline.

237
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,277
Please don't
look at my hairline.

238
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:39,415
It's over.

239
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,289
She saw my bald spot.

240
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,850
- I'm going to my physics class.

241
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:48,463
- Physics.

242
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,729
You're studying to be
an astronaut.

243
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:51,770
- No.

244
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,169
Do you even know
what physics is?

245
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,639
- Oh, yeah, physics.

246
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,677
Physics is the study of matter,
and-

247
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:01,076
- Let's see how long it takes
for him to look at my breasts.

248
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,248
- Those things are huge.

249
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,476
I need to suck 'em
or at least tit bang 'em a little.

250
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,349
Girl, if you knew
what I could do to you.

251
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,115
- Hello?

252
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,248
My head's up here.

253
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:14,019
- Oh.

254
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,060
Sorry, I was-

255
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:18,494
- Maybe you should ask
what my name is.

256
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,054
- What's your name?

257
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,066
- My name's Caroline.
Thanks for asking.

258
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,601
But I have to head to class,

259
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:28,936
so I'll see you around,
Andrew Wood.

260
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,033
- How did you know
what my name was?

261
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,203
- Devon told me.

262
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,405
- Devon.

263
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,074
He was my
ultra homosexual friend.

264
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,673
From the moment
this boy was born,

265
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,413
all he could think about
was cocks and fashion.

266
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,784
He had helped me before,

267
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,085
and surely
he would help me again.

268
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,148
Where would I be without Devon?

269
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,286
Good old,
ultra homosexual Devon.

270
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:52,764
[knocks on door]

271
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,732
- Who is it?
- It's me.

272
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,427
I need your help with something.

273
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,461
- Andy pants, Andy pants,
who is it this time?

274
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:02,734
Oh, and you brought
Max with you.

275
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:03,797
How's it going, butterball?

276
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:04,843
- Good, Devon.

277
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,207
I'm always good.

278
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,509
- Ooh.

279
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,108
You ladies hear about
the perverted jock

280
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,152
on the wrestling team?

281
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,380
- No, what happened?

282
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:16,478
- Well, apparently...

283
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,989
a player was kicked off the team

284
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,753
for rubbing up against
the other wrestlers.

285
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:22,157
[laughter]

286
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,855
See, during
their last practice,

287
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,159
he rubbed his manhood...

288
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:28,359
so hard up against
the other wrestler's back,

289
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,800
that it bruised him.

290
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,270
My only complaint,
that no one sent him to me.

291
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,172
- You'd suck him sideways,
wouldn't you, faggot?

292
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,675
I can't believe
you just thought that.

293
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:38,710
This is the 21st century.

294
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,369
Grow up and apologize.

295
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,413
I'm sorry, Devon.

296
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,072
I'm so sorry.

297
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:46,049
- Sorry, why?

298
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:47,346
Why are you sorry?

299
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,445
- Why don't you sit down, Dev?

300
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,319
- I can't.

301
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,756
Jesse pounded me
so hard last night,

302
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,020
it hurts when I sit.

303
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,994
- Now, why do you let him
do that?

304
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,029
It's not classy.

305
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,428
- I know.

306
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,557
I mean, he's just
such a typical man that way,

307
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:05,536
trying to prove how strong he is
by banging me up.

308
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:07,094
It really hurts now.

309
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:12,769
So, Andrew, why were you
apologizing before?

310
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,642
- I was thinking hateful,
terrible thoughts,

311
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,237
and I feel ashamed.

312
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:19,148
Oh, it was nothing.

313
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,880
I am sorry to hear
about your bum, though.

314
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,149
- Oh, don't you worry about it.

315
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:25,190
It will heal.

316
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,226
- [laughs]

317
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,687
- So.

318
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,732
[gasps]

319
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,630
Hoo!
- You okay?

320
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:38,169
- So what kind of girl
do you want?

321
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:40,432
You want blonde, brunette,
Asian fantasy?

322
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,497
Ooh, ebony queen.

323
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:45,475
- No, no, no, no,
this girl knows me.

324
00:15:45,544 --> 00:15:47,774
She said you told her my name.

325
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:49,211
- Well, you're gonna
have to give me

326
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,578
a little more info than that,
sweetie.

327
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,948
- She's got dark hair,

328
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,953
young face,

329
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:58,489
and classic teardrop titties.

330
00:15:58,557 --> 00:15:59,751
- How big?

331
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,554
- Weak C.

332
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:02,787
- C?

333
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:04,158
- No, flip back
to the B section.

334
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:05,560
C sounds too big.

335
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,791
- Do no such thing.

336
00:16:06,865 --> 00:16:08,958
I got a good look at 'em,
saw the cup.

337
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:10,296
A weak C.

338
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,893
- How could you know that?

339
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,529
You only saw her for a second.

340
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,869
- Is this the girl?

341
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,272
- Yes.
- Weak C.

342
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,435
- Told you.

343
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,205
- Wow.

344
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,043
- How many girls you got
in this book?

345
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,242
It's incredible.
- 1,200.

346
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,614
- Amazing.

347
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,084
- Thank you.

348
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,053
Okay, her name
is Caroline Goldman.

349
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,750
Okay, she's had four boyfriends,
two serious and two flings,

350
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,556
and I think she wants
to make you number three.

351
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,823
- Whoa, for a fling
or to be her boyfriend?

352
00:16:38,897 --> 00:16:40,660
- Don't know,
beats the shit out of me.

353
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:41,757
- How do you know this?

354
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,699
- Well, we were talking about
you and Max.

355
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:45,828
I just only didn't say anything
because, you know,

356
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,064
figured she wasn't your type.

357
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:50,734
So do you want her phone number
or IM contacto?

358
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,868
- Why was she asking about Max?

359
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,470
- Honey, we were watching
one of his blooper videos,

360
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:57,071
and she asked.

361
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,413
- Well, how do you know
she likes me and not him?

362
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:04,855
- Because, baby cakes,
she said your pic looked cute.

363
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:06,914
Who's a pretty?

364
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,620
- Well, then, yeah, yeah,
give me her contact info.

365
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,162
- Okay.

366
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,561
- You know,
I love watching you work.

367
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:13,598
- What?

368
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:15,462
What's wrong with me
having this baby on my list?

369
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,501
- Nothing's wrong with it,

370
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:17,830
but I don't want you
yelling at her

371
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,734
when you think
she's staring at your bald spot.

372
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:21,238
- That only happened twice,

373
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,002
and both times the bitches
were staring right at my crown.

374
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:25,304
- Easy, ladies.

375
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,605
Loud noises upset me.

376
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,578
- Sorry, Devon.
- Sorry, Devon.

377
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,741
- It's all right.

378
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,581
However, there is something
you can do for me.

379
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:35,813
- What do you need?

380
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,152
- I want
that sweet wrestler's name.

381
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,918
I want to know where he's at.

382
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,516
- Consider it done.

383
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,890
I'll find it tonight
on messenger.

384
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:43,928
- Yes, go!

385
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,556
Go and find me-
find me my lost boy.

386
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,195
- Holy shit.

387
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:51,202
Who is that?
- Come on.

388
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,966
I still need to find out
a way for us to make some money.

389
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:55,631
The only way
I'm gonna get back into school

390
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,038
is to pay off the dean,

391
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,009
and I mean pay him off so hard

392
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,409
that he even fixes
my transcript.

393
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,447
- First I want to say good-bye
to my friend Devon here,

394
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,540
a true, true ladies man.

395
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,847
I respect you.
- Thank you.

396
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,945
See you ladies later,
and don't forget:

397
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:12,115
everyone's gay;
it's all mental.

398
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,488
Free your mind.

399
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,652
Shake it, shake it, shake it.

400
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,798
[knocks on door]

401
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,426
- Come in.

402
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,809
What's wrong, brittlely bones?

403
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:34,846
- I need money.

404
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,904
Max, I can't
live like this anymore.

405
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,677
I think I'm gonna
have to move home.

406
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,978
- Can't have that.

407
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,451
- What am I gonna do?

408
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,078
I don't have next month's rent,

409
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,419
and pretty soon, I won't have
enough money for Growpecia.

410
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:46,685
- Does that stuff really work?

411
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,055
- Yes.

412
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,424
It just takes time.

413
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,053
- What do you need money for?

414
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,826
- So that I can buy my way
back into school

415
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:58,495
and hopefully one day
get a hair transplant.

416
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,166
- You would do that, huh?

417
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,798
You would let a doctor
cut open your head

418
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,103
and transfer the hairs?

419
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:05,939
- Not just any doctor.

420
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,206
I want the guy who did
Matthew McConaughey.

421
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:11,205
- He's going bald?
- And Jude Law.

422
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,614
And that's my point.

423
00:19:12,684 --> 00:19:15,778
No one can tell.

424
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:18,118
I'm running out of time, Max.

425
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,158
People are laughing at me
everywhere I go,

426
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:23,854
and-and the ones who
don't laugh look away in shame.

427
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,193
My days are numbered.

428
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:29,234
Help me.

429
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,495
Please help me, Max.

430
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,696
- Give me an hour.

431
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,472
One hour.

432
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,033
I feel an idea a-brewing.

433
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,373
- What do I do until then?

434
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,537
- Go.

435
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:42,841
Go to Caroline's.

436
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:46,043
You place an investigation
on her tilly.

437
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:47,813
Go.

438
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:50,650
When you come back
in 60 minutes, little buddy,

439
00:19:50,722 --> 00:19:52,553
we're gonna be in business.

440
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:54,785
Go.

441
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,521
- [screams]

442
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,724
Oh, my.

443
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,027
- Eww.

444
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,499
He's disgusting.

445
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,400
I never
want to go to your house.

446
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,233
- Thank you, Max.

447
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,432
How's my hair?

448
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:12,204
- My favorite is still
the boombastic bloopers.

449
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,404
Maybe 'cause it's got the word
boombastic in it,

450
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:17,073
and I loved to get boomed
in my ass with a dick.

451
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,242
- You really love cock, man.

452
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,616
- Oh, you know it.

453
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:22,779
- Well, you'll be happy to hear

454
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:25,516
I have the perverted wrestler's
information for you.

455
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,922
Turns out
he's in our Psych class.

456
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:28,391
- Oh, gimme.

457
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,088
- His name is Joey Powers,
and from what I hear,

458
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,597
he's practically ready
to bust out of the closet.

459
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,428
- Oh, well, if he needs
any help, honey,

460
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,230
I'll break that closet door off
with my throat.

461
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:42,331
Ride 'em, cowgirl.

462
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,374
Where's he at?

463
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:44,409
- Sixth floor.

464
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:45,500
- You're lying.

465
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,544
- No.

466
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,417
- Andrew, I need you
to help me fix my computer.

467
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:57,682
Can you come to my room?

468
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,121
- Yeah.

469
00:20:59,191 --> 00:21:00,590
Yeah, sure, I can fix it.

470
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,354
I could also eat your ass.

471
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,724
You hear me?

472
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:05,956
I will eat your ass.

473
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,896
I will eat it!

474
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,172
Is this bitch working
for bin Laden?

475
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,211
- Sorry about my room.

476
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,871
I'm in the nuclear
development program,

477
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,278
and I love history.

478
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,077
Did you know that
Albert Einstein was Jewish?

479
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,481
- Really?
- Yeah, isn't that funny?

480
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,781
- Yeah, Jews are hysterical.

481
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:32,881
Oh, shit, she might be one
of the few people who hates Jews.

482
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,926
- Yeah, my mother is Jewish,
and when I was little,

483
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:36,358
she used to tell me
all these stories

484
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,225
about the great Albert Einstein.

485
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,594
- I bet she did.

486
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:40,927
Houston, this is Andrew Wood.

487
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:41,966
Come in, please, over.

488
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,968
- This is Houston.
Go ahead, Andrew.

489
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,833
- Yeah, I need clearance
for a fly out.

490
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,428
- What's your equipment, son?

491
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:50,270
- I got a half-Jewish pussy
ready for takeoff, over.

492
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:51,673
- Proceed with caution

493
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,677
and make sure not to
promise her anything, over.

494
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:55,406
- Thanks, Houston.

495
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,447
- Houston?

496
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,607
What are you talking about?

497
00:21:57,683 --> 00:21:59,173
- Oh.

498
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,275
Uh, nothing.

499
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:02,343
- You do that a lot.

500
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,547
- What?

501
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:04,782
- I don't know
what they call it.

502
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,222
You just kind of wander off
into your thoughts.

503
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:09,886
- That's because I'm going bald,
and I have no confidence.

504
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:10,928
In another six months,

505
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:15,023
I'll be as bald as Bruce Willis
or Jude Law.

506
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,091
But then again,
Jude's hairline

507
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,866
and general thickness
has improved over the years.

508
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,737
Maybe he had a hair transplant.

509
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,540
This is why I have to go
to Hollywood.

510
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:29,705
- Hello, Andrew?
- Yes.

511
00:22:29,781 --> 00:22:31,874
- You're really weird.

512
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,178
But I like you.

513
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,185
You look like Ross...

514
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:37,721
from <i>Friends.</i>

515
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,958
And Ross is sexy.

516
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:46,364
- Stay focused.

517
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,398
If you want head,

518
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:49,093
you're gonna have to
eat her out first.

519
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,932
Oh, Lord,
you are too good to me.

520
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:58,202
From now on, I'm gonna do
everything in my power

521
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:00,403
to be a better person.

522
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,446
Bikity.

523
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:03,947
- What?

524
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,316
- You are so beautiful.

Please don't smell bad.

If it tastes like trout,
get out.

00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:58,196
If it tastes like chicken,
keep on lickin'.

532

00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:04,973
It tastes like chicken.

00:24:05,043 --> 00:24:06,010
Thank you, Lord.

536
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,739
I'm gonna eat this one for you.

What's wrong, O. B?

539
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,109

00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:17,951
- Uh-oh, not again.

541
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,615
You sit down.

542
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,988
You sit down.

543
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,187
We're about to smoke
a bucket of weed.

544
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:27,789
- You should have seen it, Max.

545
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,527
They were laughing at me.

546
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,068
They were making fun of me.

547
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,161
Someone even threw something
at me, man.

548
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:34,205
- Where were you?

549
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:35,432
- Chicken Shack.

550
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:37,668
- Damn it.

551
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,437
Why do people
have to be so cold?

552
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:43,038
- One guy yelled out,
"Hey, Lardo.

553
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:45,708
"You're a real fat pig,
aren't you?

554
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,445
You fat pig."

555
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,987
But I'll kill him.

556
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:53,684
I'll become the bulk,
and I'll kill their ass, man.

557
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:55,282
- You take this out on Mr. Bong.

558
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,921
- # Yes, I'm lonely #

559
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,763
# Oh, so lonely #

560
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,995
# If I could only #

561
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,004
# Ride the pony #

562
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,664
# Find a woman #

563
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,507
# I'll start doing the Jamaican jerk #

564
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,341
- You think this is all right
with my heart?

565
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,472
- Don't be ridiculous.

566
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,016
You got the heart
of an elephant.

567
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:22,315
You hit this 50 times,
fast.

568
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:31,091
- # My friends are all laughing #

569
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:35,826
# My love life is a joke #

570
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,995
# I forget all my problems #

571
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,507
# And take another toke #

572
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:46,942
# Romance ain't no worry #

573
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:51,278
# When you're getting high #

574
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,648
# So I ain't in no hurry #

575
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,779
# My hand will get me by #

576
00:25:57,856 --> 00:26:00,381
# Yes, I'm lonely #

577
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:04,123
- [coughs]

578
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:08,359
Oh, that's delicious.

579
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:09,923
Do you have any sodas?

580
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,765
- That is a luxury
I cannot afford, O.B.

581
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:14,805
- Max.

582
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:16,602
We have a question.

583
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,610
- Ladies.

584
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,306
I think you just saved
Andrew Wood's life.

585
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,076
Will you give me a second?
- Fine with us.

586
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,084
- O.B.

587
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,022
One day when I make my money,

588
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,526
me and you are gonna open up
a restaurant of our own.

589
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,062
And what are we gonna call that?

590
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,290
- The Ultimate Biscuit.

591
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:41,855
- Yeah.

592
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,662
And when people meet there,
they're gonna say,

593
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,896
"Dude, meet me
at the fuckin' Ulti Bisc."

594
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:48,496
We'll only serve
gigantic portions,

595
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:50,234
and only
the most gigantic people

596
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:51,400
will be allowed to work there.

597
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:54,741
- God, a place where I
could eat in freedom, right?

598
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:55,837
This sounds wonderful, man.

599
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:57,643
- The walls will be decorated

600
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:01,675
with posters of obese people
enjoying life through feast.

601
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,152
And the centerpiece is gonna be

602
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:07,487
an all-you-can-eat bar
of cake, pie, ice cream...

603
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,754
- Pudding.
- And milk shakes.

604
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,489
And it won't be a bar, no.

605
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:13,190
This will be an island.

606
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:16,461
- Your words are like
chocolate poetry to me.

607
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:19,469
When will they be so?

608
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:23,837
- Soon, my portly friend, soon.

609
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,876
Ladies, once upon a time,

610
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:28,071
you said you wanted to be a part
of my internet business.

611
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,410
- Mm-hmm.
- Does that offer still stand?

612
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,074
- Yeah.
- Why?

613
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,311
- Well, it's gonna require
you to take off your clothes.

614
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:37,079
- And why would I do that?

615
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,588
- Not just you.

616
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:39,681
Shirtless Cynthia too.

617
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,016
- What are you talking about?

618
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,027
- I'm talking about the future.

619
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,063
You can open up
a hundred fashion companies

620
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,655
if you listen to me.

621
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:50,826
All I need are your bodies,
your trust,

622
00:27:50,902 --> 00:27:52,164
and your phone tree
of hot women.

623
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,437
- Well, how many do you need?

624
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,169
- Well, how many can you bring?

625
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:00,706
- 60 to 100.

626
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,906
- [coughs]

627
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,676
We start tomorrow.

628
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:07,912
200 boobies in one day

629
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:09,749
is something every man
should experience,

630
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,187
and if not that,
they should at least see it.

631
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:13,656
People.

632
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:15,989
This is gonna be a celebration,

633
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,052
a celebration of the human body.

634
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:19,426
- What can I do to help, Max?

635
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,192
- You're gonna be head
of security with the B.

636
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,996
- Oh, the B rules.

637
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,297
- Give me your dad's
credit card.

638
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,133
- Hmm?

639
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:39,406
- The fuck is going on here?

640
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:44,722
Max, where are you?

641
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:46,724
- In the basement.

642
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:47,917
Come on down, little buddy.

643
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,191
- Hi.

644
00:28:58,803 --> 00:28:59,963
What's this?

645
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,063
- This is your new business.

646
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,165
Welcome to the big time,
little buddy.

647
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,231
- What is it?

648
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,777
- Have a seat.

649
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:09,908
Have a drink.

650
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:12,074
I want to explain something
to you.

651
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,586
For years now, I have watched
men get rich off the internet

652
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,644
while I just stood idly by.

653
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,553
Well, all that's gonna change,
Woodsy,

654
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:20,955
because me and you,

655
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,255
we're going into the
adult entertainment industry.

656
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,295
- Go on.

657
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:25,693
This equipment
you see before you

658
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,324
will be used
to service lonely men,

659
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,390
and in some cases, women too.

660
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:31,435
- How?

661
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,767
- Look around you, Woodsy,
what do you see?

662
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,864
- I don't know,
lingerie and dildos.

663
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,408
- See, it might not be
the stock market,

664
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:40,307
but I guarantee you,
this will make money.

665
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,711
All we got to do is put girls
in front of these cameras,

666
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,545
and the money will circulate
around the world

667
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,551
and into our bank accounts.

668
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,211
- You know what my parents
are gonna do to me

669
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,254
if they found out?

670
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:53,017
- In the words of the B,
fuck those clowns.

671
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,854
You said you needed
to make some money.

672
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:57,019
Well, this operation
is gonna make you money.

673
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:00,394
If some guy logs on
and sees some girl playing with a dildo,

674
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:01,830
bam,

675
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,891
that is $1,000
into our bank account.

676
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,334
- Max, you're wasting your time.

677
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,736
No one's gonna spend $1,000
to see a girl do that.

678
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,774
- You're right.

679
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,206
They pay $2,000.

680
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:14,006
I did my research, Woodsy,
before I bought the equipment.

681
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:16,808
The 10,000 other websites
that offer live stripping

682
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,815
charge up to $2,500.

683
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,010
And most of them
don't even have clear cameras.

684
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:24,213
I got us the clearest cameras
in the biz.

685
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:26,018
- Would you stop doing that?

686
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:31,221
- Each camera you see before you
offers 8.5 megapixels of pussy.

687
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,129
In laymen terms,
that is clear-cut images

688
00:30:34,199 --> 00:30:37,965
of tits, ass, dildos,
and hair pie.

689
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,799
- And what happens
when we get caught?

690
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,634
- Get caught?

691
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,264
Not even illegal.

692
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,569
It might be a little bit wrong,

693
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,110
but Heather and Shirtless Cynthia
are on their way over

694
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,236
with a truckload of women,

695
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,406
and our only responsibility

696
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:53,041
is to watch 'em get naked
and pay 'em.

697
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,190
Sign right there.

698
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,554
- Well, what's this?

699
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,388
- This is
your personal contract.

700
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,427
- What does it say?

701
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:07,931
- It says you, Andrew Wood,
are a CEO.

702
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,728
- I always wanted to be a CEO.

703
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,234
- Now's your chance.

704
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,269
Sign.

705
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:22,475
Now, you get some sleep,
Mr. President,

706
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,208
'cause tomorrow's
gonna be a long day

707
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:25,874
of watching girls
take their clothes off.

708
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,417
It's called
the recruitment process.

709
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,350
- Maybe I was crazy
for trusting him,

710
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,354
or maybe I wasn't.

711
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:32,389
Thanks.

712
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,925
It's just like
Morgan Freeman once said.

713
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:38,258
Get busy living
or get busy dying.

714
00:31:38,329 --> 00:31:40,627
I choose the first one.

715
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,837
[coughs]

716
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,693
- [screams]

717
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,505
- So what makes you think
you'd feel comfortable

718
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:25,974
getting undressed
for other people?

719
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:29,343
- I do it all the time anyway.

720
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,440
And I like to discipline too.

721
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,041
- You're hired.

722
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,085
Next.

723
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,647
- Do you have any problems
working with large objects?

724
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:41,453
- Oh, not at all.

725
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:44,859
I brought along my punisher
with me.

726
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,090
[together]
Whoa.

727
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,156
- Do you want to see me
swallow this

728
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,360
or shall I hide it
in my huckleberry?

729
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:53,495
[together]
Ooh.

730
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:54,970
- You're hired.

731
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,472
Next.

732
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,304
- I'll suck the roof off
your dick.

733
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,344
- Hired.
- Next.

734
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,072
- Well, I'm a virgin,

735
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,580
and I think this is
the perfect way to lose it.

736
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,616
- You're hired.

737
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,878
- Cocks!

738
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:09,010
- You're hired.
Next.

739
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:10,054
- Yes!

740
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:14,752
- I like to ride big,

741
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,589
hard,

742
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:20,597
strong, wet bulls,

743
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,156
but longer than eight seconds.

744
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:28,935
- You're hired.

745
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:29,974
Next.

746
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,305
- I can break-dance
on a cucumber.

747
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:33,503
- Interesting.

748
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,069
- You can put a piece of coal
in my ass

749
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:39,048
and pound it into a diamond.

750
00:33:39,117 --> 00:33:40,948
- You must be a millionaire.

751
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,782
You're hired.

752
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,981
- I once had 13 orgasms.

753
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,490
- Hired.

754
00:33:46,557 --> 00:33:47,524
- Yay!

755
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:49,184
- I'll suck your dickses.

756
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,458
- I don't think I rented
enough computers.

757
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,361
- Were we supposed to have
this many applicants?

758
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,399
- How many do we have?

759
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:56,728
- 105.

760
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:59,269
- At this rate,
we can go for 24 hours.

761
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:00,497
- I thought
I was gonna get stuck

762
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:01,868
with some boring job for years.

763
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:04,669
Now I'm actually excited
for a new tomorrow.

764
00:34:10,314 --> 00:34:11,872
[awkward cheering]

765
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,918
[upbeat rock music]

766
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:22,950
# #

767
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:19,399
# #

768
00:36:57,582 --> 00:37:00,881
- Everything is going perfect.

769
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:04,319
I paid my way back into school,
paid my debts,

770
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:08,381
and Caroline is actually telling people
I'm her boyfriend.

771
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,222
I even have an appointment
with the doctor

772
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:12,854
who did Matthew McConaughey's
hair transplant.

773
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,990
That's right,
Matthew McConaughey,

774
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,195
hair transplant.

775
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:22,535
Mine's this summer,
and I can barely wait.

776
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,875
Cat box, that was a clever name.

777
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,646
Max came up with it
for the website.

778
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,517
He said it had a double meaning.

779
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,887
It was probably because
things were going so well

780
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,483
that Max had to go
and screw it all up.

781
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,188
For the rest of my life,

782
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:49,222
I will never be able
to face my mother.

783
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:58,898
- Prepare the great hall,
full staff meeting tonight,

784
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:01,342
cameramen, performers,
hackers, anyone,

785
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:06,008
anyone who's ever worked for us.

786
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,753
Yes.

787
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:19,295
I better get a business suit.

788
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,662
Tomorrow, I could be a billionaire.

789
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:33,801
Good evening.

790
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,711
Friends, I want to thank
all of you for coming tonight,

791
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,249
but first, actually,
I want to thank Orville.

792
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,648
He catered tonight's party.

793
00:38:40,718 --> 00:38:41,685
Food's delicious.

794
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,083
Way to go, buddy.

795
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,883
- The B rules.

796
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:48,152
[cheers and applause]

797
00:38:48,225 --> 00:38:50,921
- So I bet you're wondering
why I called this meeting

798
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,121
and organized this party,

799
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:54,687
but first I'd love to tell you

800
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,528
how much I appreciate
all your hard work.

801
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,431
And congratulate yourselves,

802
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,403
because we made this money legitimately
and on our own.

803
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:04,441
[cheers and applause]

804
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,038
Soon, soon.

805
00:39:09,113 --> 00:39:11,638
Soon we will, believe me.

806
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,276
But first,
I really want to tell you

807
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:18,049
I owe all my success
to the people in this room.

808
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:19,783
So if any of you
feel uncomfortable

809
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,916
with the proposal
I'm about to make,

810
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:23,857
feel free to walk,
no questions asked.

811
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:26,920
[indistinct whispering]

812
00:39:26,997 --> 00:39:29,056
People, people, calm down.

813
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,966
You haven't heard
my proposal yet.

814
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,469
About two hours ago,

815
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,472
I received an email
from our top foreign client.

816
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:44,213
Behind this sheet is a picture
of what he wants us to do.

817
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,150
[gasps]

818
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,810
- That's disgusting.

819
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:52,447
- Calm down, people...

820
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,424
'cause this is how much you're
gonna get paid, pretty much.

821
00:39:55,493 --> 00:39:58,087
[flatulent sound]

822
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,720
Any questions?

823
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:05,826
So I guess from your silence...

824
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,564
you're not interested, right?

825
00:40:07,638 --> 00:40:08,764
- Of course.
- No.

826
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:09,806
- Forget the party.

827
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,068
Let's do it tonight.

828
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:15,169
- For that much money,
I'd stick a bathtub up my ass.

829
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:18,515
- Okay.

830
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,449
People, we'll start tomorrow,
9:00 A.M.

831
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,077
Full cast and crew.

832
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,621
Now it's a party, people.

833
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:27,657
[cheers and applause]

834
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:10,361
- I swear, this girl
has the throat of a walrus.

835
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,422
[dog whimpers]

836
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:54,811
- What the fuck?

837
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:55,846
Bitch!

838
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:01,377
- It is now time for class.

839
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:03,044
Swallow this serenity tea

840
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,680
so you may have strength
throughout your day.

841
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:06,916
- Thanks, Hiroshi.

842
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:19,627
Are you guys cool rolling joints
for the rest of the day?

843
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,975
- Professor noticed
you were gone.

844
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:03,946
- Really?
What'd he say?

845
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:04,981
- Nothing major.

846
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,949
Just, "Where's the bald kid?"

847
00:43:07,017 --> 00:43:09,451
- Did I miss anything?

848
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,078
- You're asking the wrong guy.

849
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:33,336
- Today I will be continuing
our discussion

850
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:37,141
on what it means
to show the truth.

851
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:42,379
Political parties
and tree huggers believe

852
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,183
our language needs to evolve

853
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:49,248
in order for us,
you and I, to evolve.

854
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:51,624
Are they right?

855
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,094
Is this so?

856
00:43:53,163 --> 00:43:57,566
- I really resent the fact
that you just labeled

857
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,365
major activists tree huggers.

858
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:02,997
Trees are living beings.

859
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,040
- Hmm.

860
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:08,340
Miss James, is it?

861
00:44:08,412 --> 00:44:10,710
Let me ask you a question?

862
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,215
Exactly how much marijuana
do you smoke?

863
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:14,841
- 'Nuff, guy, 'nuff.

864
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:18,319
- Silence yourself!

865
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:22,325
- I teach this class to offer
my students valuable lessons.

866
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,987
If you are too stoned
to learn from them,

867
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,825
I might have to kill you.

868
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:27,989
- What?

869
00:44:28,065 --> 00:44:30,761
- Kill you with...

870
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,529
some extra homework.

871
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34,161
[laughs]

872
00:44:34,238 --> 00:44:35,671
What?

873
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:36,899
Damn funny!

874
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:38,999
[laughs]

875
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:43,035
Which brings me
to today's lesson.

876
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,444
Is the truth racist,

877
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,710
or is it simply
stating the facts?

878
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:49,514
You're final assignment
for the school year

879
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:53,215
will be to construct
a 5,000-word essay

880
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:57,522
based on
the following statement.

881
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:03,593
"Open your lips.

882
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,464
"Widen your throat.

883
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,733
Jamaican black dick
makes the white girl choke."

884
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,775
[all gasp]

885
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,444
"Open your lips.

886
00:45:15,512 --> 00:45:16,638
"Widen your throat.

887
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:22,380
Jamaican black dick
makes the white girl choke."

888
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:24,978
Fact...

889
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,114
or racism?

890
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:29,659
[chuckles]

891
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,025
Yes.

892
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:35,259
Your job is to analyze
this statement

893
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:36,822
and decide whether or not
you believe,

894
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,698
yes, this statement is true,

895
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,431
or no,
the statement is false.

896
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:42,529
- # Ooh ooh #

897
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:43,573
# Ooh ooh ooh ooh #

898
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,700
- This assignment is worth
90% of your final grade.

899
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:47,744
- Ooh?

900
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:49,904
- And I need 16 references,

901
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,949
and no, I am not a reference.

902
00:45:53,016 --> 00:45:54,040
Any questions?

903
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:56,279
- I love you, sir.

904
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:57,752
- Hmm.

905
00:45:57,821 --> 00:46:01,780
Mr. Wood, I'm glad to see
that you're back in class.

906
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:05,090
I believe that your finances
are back in order.

907
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:07,722
- Yes, sir, they certainly are.

908
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,727
I also booked an appointment
with the same doctor

909
00:46:12,803 --> 00:46:15,135
who did Matthew McConaughey's
hair transplant.

910
00:46:15,205 --> 00:46:18,265
That's right,
hair transplant McConaughey.

911
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,934
- You're very weird, Mr. Wood.

912
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:26,105
Now that I've given you
your assignment,

913
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:28,811
you can all leave my classroom.

914
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:29,978
Now!

915
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:31,918
- I'm gonna swing by Devon's
after Anthro,

916
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:32,956
you gonna come?

917
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:34,820
- I can't.
- Why?

918
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,759
- Because I'm bald, Max.

919
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:40,194
- No, you're not.

920
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,129
[chuckles]

921
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:45,502
[knocks on door]

922
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,127
- Come in.

923
00:46:47,204 --> 00:46:48,193
Oh, hello.

924
00:46:48,272 --> 00:46:50,433
If it isn't my two little
sweet tootsie babies.

925
00:46:50,507 --> 00:46:51,701
What can I do you for?

926
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:53,402
- Do you still have both copies
of <i>Home Alone,</i>

927
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,967
I mean, <i>Homo Abone?</i>

928
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:56,410
- Yes, why?

929
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,072
- I need to borrow 'em.

930
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,547
- Okay, I'll get 'em for you.

931
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:06,987
Such a weirdo request for you.

932
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:09,855
I thought you were only into
those Stanley Kubrick

933
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:12,020
and Oliver Stone movies.

934
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:14,757
- You always got to make time
for the classics.

935
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:15,958
- Speaking of classics,

936
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,001
we both just saw your movie,

937
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:21,595
and it was fantastical.

938
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,401
- It really is something,
sweetheart.

939
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:24,770
You should be proud of yourself.

940
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,366
- Oh, stop, guys.

941
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:29,378
Now, you didn't find it too,
you know, offensive and gross?

942
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:32,677
- Oh, well, other than
your crude ending.

943
00:47:32,749 --> 00:47:37,277
- You scared the cum out of me
with that big finish.

944
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,321
- Thanks for the videos.

945
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:39,355
I'm gonna go to class.

946
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,653
- All right, see you, ladies.
- Wait, hold on a second.

947
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:44,558
Do you know why Caroline
hasn't called me back lately?

948
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:47,028
- Boy, are you in trouble.

949
00:47:47,097 --> 00:47:48,997
Caroline found about your little,

950
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:51,626
or should I say huge,
business operation.

951
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,533
To say the least,
she isn't happy.

952
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:54,798
- Ungrateful ho.

953
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,999
How does she think I pay
for all our dinners and movies?

954
00:47:57,074 --> 00:48:01,534
Well, will you tell her I'm sorry
and to have her please call me?

955
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:04,445
- Just go by her room
after class,

956
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:05,742
and I'll make sure
she talks to you.

957
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:07,443
- Thanks, Dev.

958
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:08,916
It's like I always say,

959
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,113
if you want to get laid
in the 21st century,

960
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:13,850
make sure you have
at least one gay friend.

961
00:48:13,924 --> 00:48:16,757
They're never too busy
to help you meet someone,

962
00:48:16,827 --> 00:48:19,295
and they're never too shy
to help you work things out.

963
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,991
In the end, gays are
some pretty awesome people.

964
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:25,865
- Make sure
you bring back that movie,

965
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:29,133
because you know how much
I love to beat off

966
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:30,605
to that shower scene

967
00:48:30,674 --> 00:48:33,472
where Macaulay Culkin
puts on the aftershave

968
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:34,532
and burns his face.

969
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:37,580
[singing operatically]

970
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:39,616
- You lied to me.

971
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:41,981
You told me you made your money
selling stuff off the internet.

972
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,019
- And that's true.

973
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,678
I sell quality entertainment.

974
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,086
Did she buy that?

975
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:47,555
- Bullshit.

976
00:48:47,624 --> 00:48:50,058
You didn't tell me because
you didn't want me to know.

977
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:52,857
- I just-I didn't want you
to break up with me.

978
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,761
Most of the time,
I think I love you.

979
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:57,391
I can't believe
I just said that.

980
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,526
- I love you too, Andrew.

981
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,901
But if you lie to me again,
I will curb your ass.

982
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:03,496
- That means
we're still together.

983
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,040
And once I get
my hair transplant,

984
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,507
she'll never
get mad at me again.

985
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:07,543
[snaps fingers]

986
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,272
- Hello?
Are you listening to me?

987
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:11,405
- I won't lie to you again.

988
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:13,312
You can count on it.

989
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:14,816
- Good.

990
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,216
How much money did you make,
anyway?

991
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,015
- Enough to buy the school.

992
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:20,352
There must be a lot
of desperate guys out there.

993
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:22,483
- You have no idea.

994
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,720
And we call them
preferred customers.

995
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,922
And then it happened.

996
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,726
Without any warning at all,

997
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,290
the commercial came on.

998
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:34,132
- Oh, my God, that's the girl
from my astronomy class.

999
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:35,171
- Cat box.

1000
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:37,433
- And that's the girl
from the cafeteria.

1001
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,338
Andrew, what is going on?

1002
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,671
- [gasps]

1003
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:41,711
Yeah, uh-huh.

1004
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:43,905
Oh, my God,
he's gonna be murdered.

1005
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,505
- Just get me his address,
do you hear me?

1006
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:47,243
- Yes, of course I'll find it.

1007
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,784
I'll find it.
I'll call you right back.

1008
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,150
- I want that son of a bitch
who did this to my daughter.

1009
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:53,121
I'm gonna fuckin' kill him!

1010
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:56,182
Gah!

1011
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:57,749
Jesus, honey.

1012
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,227
- We've already discussed it.

1013
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:00,354
I think he's gonna die.

1014
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,590
Yeah, they're coming after him.

1015
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:02,825
Oh, one second.
Stop it.

1016
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:03,866
- Oh, my God.

1017
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,424
- Charlotte.

1018
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,799
- Alan.

1019
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:08,804
- Stop that.
Stop that right now.

1020
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:10,100
Oh, Jesus!

1021
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,300
Oh, sweet mother of Moses,
look at this!

1022
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:14,207
- Yeah, uh-huh, I know.

1023
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:15,244
He's gonna die.

1024
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:16,279
Yeah, I can just-
oh, one second.

1025
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,110
- My baby girl,
what are you doing?

1026
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,809
- Don't do-
how do they do that?

1027
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:21,873
Oh, my God, look at-

1028
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:24,147
- Charlotte.

1029
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:25,620
- Ooh, wow.

1030
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:28,556
- Charlotte!

1031
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,684
- Joey, Joey, look at-

1032
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:34,128
- And then finishes off
a blue whale.

1033
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:37,166
- Fuck it.

1034
00:50:37,234 --> 00:50:39,498
- Just answer the question.

1035
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:41,696
Did you make that tape?

1036
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:43,330
- Not exactly.

1037
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:45,102
- Well, did you or didn't you?

1038
00:50:45,175 --> 00:50:46,142
- This is it.

1039
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,233
You're history.

1040
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,937
Listen to me.

1041
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:50,138
I love you.

1042
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,545
Maybe one day,
I'll even marry you,

1043
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:55,414
but now can you find it
in your heart to forgive me?

1044
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:58,010
[cell phone rings]

1045
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,350
It's Max.

1046
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:00,720
This might be an emergency.

1047
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,316
Hello?

1048
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,953
Yeah, yeah, I saw it.

1049
00:51:06,029 --> 00:51:07,656
- You need to come home
right away.

1050
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,720
- Devon's on the other line,

1051
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:10,426
and apparently there's a bunch
of angry parents

1052
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,058
on the way over here
to teach us a lesson.

1053
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:13,659
- Well, how the hell
did they find out?

1054
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,705
- Saw the commercial,
asked their daughters.

1055
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:16,739
- Makes sense.

1056
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,638
All right, I'll be right there.

1057
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,346
Some parents are coming up
to kill me and Max.

1058
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:24,971
I really have to go home.

1059
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:26,675
- Well, serves you right.

1060
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,981
- And now for the question
I'm afraid to ask.

1061
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:31,520
Will you ever
have anal sex with me?

1062
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,555
- What?

1063
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,715
- I mean...

1064
00:51:34,791 --> 00:51:37,851
do you still want to be
my friend?

1065
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,691
- Yes.

1066
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:43,494
But only if you say
you love me again.

1067
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:45,330
That sounded kind of nice.

1068
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:46,369
- Really?

1069
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,994
You're not mad at me?

1070
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:51,268
- At first I was,
but now I'm kind of proud.

1071
00:51:51,341 --> 00:51:53,309
- You've got to be joking.

1072
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:55,844
- No, I mean, you set up a business
and made your fortune

1073
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:58,437
before your 21st birthday.

1074
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:01,575
Not the most socially acceptable
way of making money,

1075
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:02,618
but it works.

1076
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:04,745
We just couldn't ever
tell the children.

1077
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:05,788
- [laughs]

1078
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:08,290
That means we're gonna
have sex without a condom.

1079
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:10,485
Will you marry me, Caroline?

1080
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,585
- If you're still alive,
we'll talk.

1081
00:52:12,662 --> 00:52:13,822
- Oh, I will be.

1082
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:16,092
Max always has a plan
for this kind of stuff.

1083
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:17,565
He's a genius, you know.

1084
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,601
- Really?

1085
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:19,862
Than what am I?

1086
00:52:19,936 --> 00:52:23,497
- Oh, my God, I want to
hit those so badly.

1087
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:25,268
I said that out loud.

1088
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:26,741
I really do love you!

1089
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,515
- Oh, Andrew.

1090
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,083
- Now, I knew something
like this was gonna happen,

1091
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,882
so I designed us a blueprint
a la <i>Home Alone-</i>

1092
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,046
<i>Homo Abone.</i>

1093
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:41,056
- So that's why you wanted
those movies from Devon.

1094
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:42,785
- Exactly.

1095
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,656
When those angry parents
get here,

1096
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:46,821
they're gonna have to fight
through a house of mazes

1097
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:49,661
and horrors so grotesque
only a sick son of a bitch

1098
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,564
like John Hughes
would think it's funny.

1099
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,330
- How many people are coming?

1100
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,564
- Altogether, six, more or less.

1101
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:56,731
- Who are they?

1102
00:52:56,806 --> 00:53:00,674
- Three angry fathers
and their wives.

1103
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:04,180
- I'll kill those slits!

1104
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:05,339
I love slits.

1105
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:07,349
- Then calm down, the B,

1106
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,577
because if all goes as planned,

1107
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:09,914
you're not gonna
have to do that.

1108
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:11,544
- Well, what's the plan, Max?

1109
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:13,521
- For the next 12 hours,

1110
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,753
we are gonna turn this house
into a death trap.

1111
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,623
Now, I have studied
the <i>Home Alone</i> series

1112
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,357
as much as one person
possibly can.

1113
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:22,898
Here is what I've come up with.

1114
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:30,438
Each one of you will be assigned
a certain area in the house.

1115
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,134
Now, since we're pulling out
all the stops,

1116
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:35,440
feel free to use your business
credit cards to their limit,

1117
00:53:35,512 --> 00:53:38,208
because money is no longer an issue.

1118
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:39,771
You just get everything
on those lists.

1119
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,111
- What if they don't come?

1120
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:43,049
- Oh, believe me,
they're gonna come.

1121
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,053
Devon said
they'll be here tomorrow

1122
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:48,147
no later than 7:30 P.M.,
which gives us enough time

1123
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,194
to wire this house head to toe
full of surprises.

1124
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:53,422
- I'm taking the backyard.

1125
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:55,691
I'm adding fucked up
night vision

1126
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:58,029
to the motherfuckin'
paintball gun.

1127
00:53:58,101 --> 00:53:59,830
- That is wonderful, the B,
and let me just say,

1128
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,370
you have always been
very creative.

1129
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:02,598
- Fuck yeah!

1130
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:03,639
- Motherfuckin' nig-

1131
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:06,699
[record scratch]

1132
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:09,336
Where am I gonna get 100 pounds
of marijuana?

1133
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,379
- You leave that to me.

1134
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:11,880
You just get the 50 cases of rum

1135
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,848
and the industrial-sized bottle
of crazy glue.

1136
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,408
Now, is everybody clear about
what their responsibilities are?

1137
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:18,215
- Wait.

1138
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:21,451
Before we go...

1139
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:23,890
I just want to say
I love you, Max.

1140
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,360
You always know
how to make my life fun.

1141
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,761
- Are you sure we need
all these explosives?

1142
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:32,097
- Of course we do.

1143
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:37,265
We're American.

1144
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,570
- Hmm, let's go, sweetheart.

1145
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,907
I'll give you a hummer
in our Hummer.

1146
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:44,708
- Sounds good to me.

1147
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:47,443
- Gun Mart, here comes the B.

1148
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:49,178
- I'll come with you.

1149
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:50,241
Thank you, Max.

1150
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,617
You've given a bald man
a second chance.

1151
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,815
- Come on, Andy, you don't care
about that anymore.

1152
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:57,758
Now, you take off your helmet,
and you show your glow.

1153
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:59,158
Bald on three.

1154
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:00,787
Everyone.

1155
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,593
One, two, three.

1156
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:04,133
[together]
Bald!

1157
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,065
- How much longer
till we get there?

1158
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,569
- Five minutes.

1159
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:09,537
I-I need to pull over.

1160
00:55:09,606 --> 00:55:11,005
I just want to check the map,
all right?

1161
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,098
- You big baby.

1162
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:16,475
Just turn the light on
in front of you and look.

1163
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:18,707
- I get my hands on this kid,
I'm gonna kill him.

1164
00:55:18,782 --> 00:55:20,147
I send my daughter
for an education,

1165
00:55:20,216 --> 00:55:22,844
she sends me back a sex video
of her dance humpin'.

1166
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:24,079
- All right, listen.

1167
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,315
When we get there,
everybody follow me, all right?

1168
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:27,981
I got the best
sense of direction.

1169
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,525
- He's telling the truth.

1170
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:31,423
He once got us
out of a snowstorm.

1171
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:33,325
You couldn't see two feet
in front of you.

1172
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:34,795
- Not my Alan, right, honey?

1173
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:36,229
You would've pulled over
to the side

1174
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:37,891
and cried
till it stopped snowing.

1175
00:55:37,967 --> 00:55:39,491
- You think your words
can hurt me, right?

1176
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:41,093
- You know they do.

1177
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,638
- I'm so excited.

1178
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:44,469
When are they gonna be here?
- Any minute now.

1179
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:45,599
- They're fuckin' dead.

1180
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,939
- What if some of them
are allergic to ecstasy?

1181
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:48,978
- They won't be.

1182
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:51,878
- Maybe we're taking this too far.

1183
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,347
I can't believe
I just said that.

1184
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,475
Was I really becoming my father?

1185
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,486
- Andy, snap out of it.

1186
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,419
No time for your <i>Wonder Years</i>
crap right now.

1187
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:00,820
Are you having second thoughts?

1188
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,791
- No, I just wanted
to say something responsible.

1189
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,023
- Good, 'cause we're about to take
bad behavior to a whole new level.

1190
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,861
- Mm.

1191
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,262
- All right.

1192
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:16,305
Here we are.

1193
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,965
- All right, let's get
the fuck out of here.

1194
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,008
Everybody follow me.

1195
00:56:26,082 --> 00:56:27,106
This kid is dead.

1196
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,236
- Hold!

1197
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:53,075
Hold!

1198
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:55,210
Hold!

1199
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:58,012
Hold!

1200
00:56:59,783 --> 00:57:02,047
Nigga!

1201
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:05,087
[gunfire]

1202
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:14,754
- Motherfuckers!

1203
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:16,458
- Elise!

1204
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,023
- Ah!

1205
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:19,068
- Hey!

1206
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:21,296
- Bruce!

1207
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:26,399
No!

1208
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:31,614
- Cut it out!

1209
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,414
- Jesus!

1210
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:40,513
- Cut it out.

1211
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,353
- Wait a minute, we're parents!

1212
00:57:45,228 --> 00:57:47,753
- It's time to end
this motherfucker.

1213
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:52,095
My motherfuckin'
mega hand grenade.

1214
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:54,693
Ninjas, vanish!

1215
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:58,835
- Holy Bezos!

1216
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:02,309
Save your asses!

1217
00:58:02,378 --> 00:58:05,176
[explosion]

1218
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,244
- Keep coming.

1219
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,183
Keep coming.

1220
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,524
- All right,
everybody stay close.

1221
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:20,324
I know it's dark in here,
but trust me,

1222
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:21,795
I know where I'm going.

1223
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:23,298
- I think it's a stairwell.

1224
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:24,856
I can't see anything.

1225
00:58:25,435 --> 00:58:27,300
Oh, my God, he's gonna kill us!

1226
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:28,337
Help!

1227
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:29,803
- Relax!

1228
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,534
It's-it's not gas.

1229
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:32,575
[sniffs]

1230
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:33,609
It's-

1231
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,076
- Marijuana smoke.

1232
00:58:36,145 --> 00:58:37,112
- No.

1233
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,273
Not ma-I'm allergic.

1234
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,283
We got to get out.
- You are not allergic.

1235
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,750
You are a pussy,
do you hear me?

1236
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:43,786
A pussy!

1237
00:58:43,953 --> 00:58:45,215
A pussy!

1238
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:47,119
- This is good shit.

1239
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,586
- I can't fight it.

1240
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,926
I'm getting fuckin' high.

1241
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,299
Fuckin' high.

1242
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,666
- Just hold your breath.

1243
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:04,229
- Bruce, it's everywhere.

1244
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:08,710
I am so fuckin' stoned.

1245
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:11,906
- Why are we here again?

1246
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,380
- What?

1247
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:15,576
You don't remember?

1248
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:17,210
We're here to kill that kid,

1249
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:21,189
that fucked up kid.

1250
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:25,957
- Why?

1251
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:30,189
- I don't remember.

1252
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:34,364
But I know it's bad.

1253
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:35,802
[chuckles]

1254
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:40,434
- Oh, yeah, he did those
sex videos with our daughters.

1255
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,774
- Oh, yeah.

1256
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:45,575
He had your daughter
humpin' a piano.

1257
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:47,047
[laughter]

1258
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:51,143
- Well, their daughter
was break-dancing on a cucumber.

1259
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,551
- Not my Charlotte.

1260
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:54,647
My Charlotte's
not flexible enough!

1261
00:59:54,724 --> 00:59:56,157
- Oh, come on.

1262
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:58,523
We got to get out of this room.

1263
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:02,691
- I'm so thirsty, you guys.

1264
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:03,732
- Hey.

1265
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:05,427
Hey, you guys,
the door's opening.

1266
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:06,866
Com on, let's get out.
Let's escape.

1267
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,836
- Ooh, blinking lights.

1268
01:00:08,905 --> 01:00:10,839
- Let's go. Let's go.

1269
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,534
- Yeah, let's take a break.

1270
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:15,578
[upbeat dance music]

1271
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:23,609
# #

1272
01:00:36,766 --> 01:00:38,597
- The colors...

1273
01:00:38,668 --> 01:00:40,533
they're moving.

1274
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:43,197
- I love a laser show.

1275
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:46,639
- Let's have something to drink,
everybody.

1276
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:49,269
- Are you sure
the water's clean?

1277
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:50,710
[laughs]

1278
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,647
- Oh, I don't care
what's inside.

1279
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:55,946
I'm so fuckin' thirsty.

1280
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:57,987
- [coughs]
It's fine.

1281
01:00:58,054 --> 01:00:59,988
It's a little strong.

1282
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:01,318
- This isn't water.

1283
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,359
This is old-fashioned hooch.

1284
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:05,451
- So drink your hooch.

1285
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:07,462
- Isn't it weird

1286
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:12,126
the way fathers who have
families and children

1287
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:14,362
all of a sudden
think they're gay?

1288
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:15,927
What's up with that?

1289
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,302
- Sounds weird to me.

1290
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:20,399
- Yeah, that's fucked up.

1291
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:22,876
- Makes sense to me.

1292
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,537
- That's 'cause
you're fuckin' sick.

1293
01:01:24,614 --> 01:01:26,377
[laughter]

1294
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:27,882
[record scratch]

1295
01:01:31,154 --> 01:01:33,315
- Whoa.

1296
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:38,588
"Please put on your face masks
and body armor."

1297
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:39,628
- Why?

1298
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:42,096
- Just fuckin' do it.

1299
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:43,132
Fuck!

1300
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,723
- Don't be such an asshole.

1301
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:46,393
Go with the flow, bro.

1302
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,562
- Alan.
- That's right, bitch!

1303
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:49,605
I'm crazy.

1304
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,230
I'm crazy now.

1305
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:53,366
Let's go!

1306
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:59,281
[all screaming]

1307
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:17,298
- Bruce!

1308
01:02:18,267 --> 01:02:19,598
- Bruce!

1309
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:21,796
Bruce, come on, Bruce,
you big jokester.

1310
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,862
- I can't.

1311
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,067
Just kill that kid.

1312
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:27,109
- Baby, come to me.

1313
01:02:27,176 --> 01:02:30,407
I'm too young to be a widow.

1314
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,504
- Yes, that's it!
That's it!

1315
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,980
All right, all right, all right!

1316
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,811
Attaboy! Let's go!

1317
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:40,949
- Bruce, I'm coming to get you!

1318
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:41,990
No one else!

1319
01:02:42,058 --> 01:02:43,320
Fuck this!

1320
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:45,019
Fuck this!

1321
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,356
Fuck this!

1322
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,896
Here I come!

1323
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,933
[all shouting at once]

1324
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,605
- Come on, Bruce!

1325
01:02:58,674 --> 01:03:02,610
- You can do it, Bruce!

1326
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:03,667
- You can do it!

1327
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:08,450
[all grunting]

1328
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:14,180
- Good evening.

1329
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:17,658
Please, take a seat.

1330
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:19,319
- [groans]

1331
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:21,795
- Hiroshi.

1332
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:24,958
Tea.

1333
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:29,136
- Oh, good God.

1334
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:30,172
- Brucie.

1335
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:47,022
[laughter]

1336
01:03:56,999 --> 01:04:00,230
- He's so handsome.

1337
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:10,544
- Let me start by saying
I respect why you guys are here.

1338
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,604
If a guy paid my daughter
to take of his clothes,

1339
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,741
I'd want him dead too.

1340
01:04:14,817 --> 01:04:16,079
But I did no such thing.

1341
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:18,712
Your daughters exercised
their own free will

1342
01:04:18,788 --> 01:04:20,415
and decided
to make some extra money.

1343
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:23,686
And now your daughters
are all millionaires.

1344
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:25,488
None of them
have to ever work again

1345
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:27,722
or marry someone
just to get out of the house.

1346
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:29,196
Now, you know how that happens.

1347
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:30,357
Two people meet.

1348
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:31,661
They get married,
and in the end,

1349
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:33,224
it was only
so they didn't have to go home

1350
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:34,667
or so they could drive
a fabulous car

1351
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:36,762
like a BMW 750
or a Range Rover.

1352
01:04:36,839 --> 01:04:39,205
Now, do you want your daughters
spending the rest of their lives

1353
01:04:39,275 --> 01:04:40,401
giving out deep throat sessions

1354
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,569
just so they can have a car
of their choice fully loaded?

1355
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:43,612
- No.

1356
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,748
- I think your daughters
are better than that,

1357
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:49,410
and I think
you're better than that too.

1358
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:51,510
And for this,
you want to harm me.

1359
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:52,554
Why?

1360
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:56,319
Before you answer that,
please finish your tea.

1361
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:57,689
- What's in it?

1362
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:58,886
- Herbs and placebos.

1363
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:00,724
The two should complement
your current state.

1364
01:05:00,796 --> 01:05:02,354
- You said millions.

1365
01:05:02,431 --> 01:05:05,025
How many millions?

1366
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:06,830
- Enough to buy 20 cruise ships.

1367
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,336
- Wow.

1368
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:09,530
- Each.

1369
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,267
- If that's not enough,

1370
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:13,569
please...

1371
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:17,003
observe.

1372
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,379
- You got a fuckin' shark
in your backyard.

1373
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:24,612
- His name's Cody.

1374
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:26,712
Like I said, millions.

1375
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:29,155
You know, some of the girls even
opened up their own businesses.

1376
01:05:29,225 --> 01:05:30,522
- Really?
- What kind?

1377
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,424
- Well, the two girls
who live downstairs

1378
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:34,053
opened up
their own fashion company,

1379
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,792
which is soon gonna be listed
on the New York Stock Exchange.

1380
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:38,424
So I ask you once again,

1381
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,492
what are you mad at?

1382
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:41,866
It certainly shouldn't be me.

1383
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,839
- I hear you.

1384
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:49,276
You think
you could put me on the...

1385
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:52,143
internet?

1386
01:05:52,214 --> 01:05:53,875
- Do you think
they'd give us any money?

1387
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,781
- I don't know.

1388
01:05:55,851 --> 01:05:57,182
I'd have to talk to them.

1389
01:05:57,253 --> 01:05:58,379
Which ones are your daughters?

1390
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,183
- Charlotte Stearn.

1391
01:06:00,256 --> 01:06:01,746
- Of course.

1392
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,018
Yeah.

1393
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:04,787
I see.

1394
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:08,159
Codename is the Barnyard,
aka the Cucumber Kid.

1395
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:11,199
- [snickering]

1396
01:06:12,568 --> 01:06:14,126
- I'd be happy to ask her
for you.

1397
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:15,727
Now, if you have
any other questions or concerns,

1398
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:16,772
now would be the time.

1399
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:18,101
- How did all this happen?

1400
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:20,574
- Well, my friend Andy
needed some money for school

1401
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,338
and a hair transplant.

1402
01:06:22,411 --> 01:06:23,537
This just seemed to work.

1403
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,136
- Amazing.

1404
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:26,909
- Now, I've enjoyed
speaking with all of you,

1405
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,280
but if you'll excuse me,

1406
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:30,581
I've got to put the finishing
touches on my movie.

1407
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,144
Now, feel free to stay,
or you can leave too.

1408
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:35,816
- I love...

1409
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:37,586
options.

1410
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,321
- Either's fine with me.

1411
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:43,525
- I think I'll, um...

1412
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,032
stay.

1413
01:06:45,101 --> 01:06:47,763
I'm a little too high
to get in the...

1414
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:48,895
[giggles]

1415
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:49,938
car.

1416
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,473
- Very well.

1417
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,701
Hiroshi will show you
to your rooms,

1418
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:56,210
and thanks for coming.

1419
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:58,007
- Can I go down on you?

1420
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:03,010
I love tongue-
I mean, tongues-infinitely.

1421
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:04,416
What do you look like nude?

1422
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:48,755
- Looks like the wolf
got into the chicken coop.

1423
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:57,231
It takes four white bitches
to suck this dick.

1424
01:07:57,306 --> 01:08:01,800
- I'm 20 years old,
and I'm going bald.

1425
01:08:01,877 --> 01:08:05,278
Only now I just don't care.

1426
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:09,909
Larry David, Danny DeVito,
Sean Connery, Moby,

1427
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:12,579
Tony Soprano, Homer Simpson,

1428
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:14,247
all great bald men.

1429
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,553
I now wish to join their ranks.

1430
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:17,887
Get busy living

1431
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,190
or get busy dying.

1432
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:21,229
That's god damn right.

1433
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,915
- Andrew?

1434
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:49,389
Oh, my God.

1435
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,824
What did you do?

1436
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:10,911
- Good morning, and welcome
to the EW market report.

1437
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,778
Right now, we are about
to witness stock market history.

1438
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:16,113
Two college girls
are about to go public

1439
01:09:16,185 --> 01:09:17,914
and ring the opening bell.

1440
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,955
Their company, Max Woods,

1441
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:23,549
has reached a record
$262 million in sales

1442
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:26,493
and will open
at an even $75 a share.

1443
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:27,824
But the interesting thing is that

1444
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:29,797
these girls didn't even-
even need the money.

1445
01:09:29,865 --> 01:09:31,765
They were already
internet millionaires.

1446
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,462
Although questions surround
how they raised their money,

1447
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:37,267
for now, let's just enjoy
another fashion company

1448
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,432
entering
an already saturated market.

1449
01:09:46,749 --> 01:09:47,943
[knocks on door]

1450
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:50,417
- Today's the big day.
- I know.

1451
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:52,681
- Be there no later than 11:00,
little buddy.

1452
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:53,847
- I know.

1453
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:56,187
- [laughs]

1454
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:24,619
[steady rock music]

1455
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:32,651
# #

1456
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:46,641
- # I have no desire #

1457
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:49,576
# To lament of my pain #

1458
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:51,738
# Or to feed the fire #

1459
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:54,339
# Of a passion burning red #

1460
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,077
# And I wonder #

1461
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:58,813
- # Wonder #

1462
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:01,822
- # Can she read between the lines #

1463
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,090
# And I wonder #

1464
01:11:07,162 --> 01:11:09,687
- # Wonder #

1465
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:13,166
- # Can she ever be mine #

1466
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:15,870
- Has it started yet?

1467
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,371
- Not yet.
- Good.

1468
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:19,634
- It's right this way.

1469
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:21,573
Nice tits, girly.

1470
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:23,339
That's a nice piece of ass too.

1471
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:27,015
- # Draped across her shoulders #

1472
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:28,049
# And I wonder #

1473
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:31,476
- # Wonder #

1474
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:36,252
- # Would she stay with me tonight #

1475
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:39,888
# And I wonder #

1476
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,624
- # Wonder #

1477
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:46,566
- # What I'd give to make her mine #

1478
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:58,911
- Fuck me.

1479
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,545
[sobbing]

1480
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:12,060
[all laughing]

1481
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:26,174
[cheers and applause]

1482
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:29,407
- That's my story.

1483
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:31,605
It might not be the best
life lesson one can learn,

1484
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,274
but it sure was a good time.

1485
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,113
If you're wondering
about my hair transplant,

1486
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:37,982
the answer is, yes.

1487
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:39,145
I cancelled my appointment

1488
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,781
with Matthew McConaughey's
hair transplant doctor

1489
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:43,552
and no longer wish
to cut open my head

1490
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:45,684
in the name of confidence
and security.

1491
01:12:45,761 --> 01:12:47,490
A wise man once said,

1492
01:12:47,563 --> 01:12:51,795
"the less hair I have,
the more head I get."

1493
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:52,993
Thanks for listening,

1494
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:55,502
and stay strong,
my balding brothers.

1495
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:57,835
We always have each other,

1496
01:12:57,906 --> 01:13:00,136
even if it's
just to compare hairlines.

1497
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,488
- # I don't want to talk about it #

1498
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,356
# Leave well enough alone #

1499
01:13:19,428 --> 01:13:22,488
# This subject causes me pain #

1500
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:24,793
# Don't act like you don't notice #

1501
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:36,208
- Don't be embarrassed.

1502
01:13:36,278 --> 01:13:38,041
- What the fuck?

1503
01:13:38,113 --> 01:13:40,445
- Come on, Woodsy,
it's the big time.

1504
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:43,485
[making siren noises]

1505
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:48,016
- Oh, I forgot about you.

1506
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,057
Here you go, baby.

1507
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:52,093
[laughing]

1508
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:55,757
Hello.

1509
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:59,358
- This'll be a celebration
of the human body.

1510
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:00,402
How can I help?

1511
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:01,731
[retches]

1512
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:02,964
This shit is disgusting.

1513
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:09,505
[laughter]

1514
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:14,275
I'll suck the roof off
your dick.

1515
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:16,317
I hate it when you make me
say this, man.

1516
01:14:16,385 --> 01:14:18,319
- All right, let's hear it.
This is it.

1517
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:20,355
Go, "Jack Latner rules."

1518
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:22,652
- Okay.

1519
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:23,691
- And go.

1520
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:25,590
- Jack Latner rules.

1521
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:27,957
Jack Latner rules.

1522
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:29,292
- Now, one time,
the B rules.

1523
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:31,764
- The B rules.

1524
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:33,495
- Say, "Hell, I rule."

1525
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:36,800
- Hell, I rule.

1526
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:38,533
- Now, just go, "Whoo."

1527
01:14:40,742 --> 01:14:45,338
- I love the B.

1528
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:46,847
I'll suck the roof off
your dick.

1529
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:50,516
- If I was Macaulay Culkin
right now,

1530
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:52,315
where would I be?

1531
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:54,218
Where's Michael Jackson's dick?

1532
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,223
- Bong, bong.
- Squishy, squishy.

1533
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:59,055
- Okay now, D, D, look not happy,
like, yeah.

1534
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:00,526
- What is it?

1535
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:02,120
I'll suck your dixies?

1536
01:15:02,197 --> 01:15:05,724
- No, your dickses,
as if it were D-I-C-K-S

1537
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:07,063
and then have an apostrophe
and an S.

1538
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,330
- Aren't boobs great?

1539
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:10,701
I love 'em.

1540
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:11,864
[giggles]

1541
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,703
Oh, I bet he loves milk.

1542
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:15,208
- Fuck yeah, nigga.

1543
01:15:15,277 --> 01:15:17,108
- Motherfucker!

1544
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,646
Fuckin' dawg, nigga.

1545
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:22,343
- Yeah.

1546
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:27,354
- Come on, Rachel, sit down now,
very slowly.

1547
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:29,219
Onto Andrew.

1548
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:30,417
- What do you mean?

1549
01:15:30,492 --> 01:15:32,187
- Sit down now.

1550
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:33,319
Lean back.

1551
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:35,386
- I can't really lean-
- Put your bum on his chest.

1552
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:36,431
- It is.

1553
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:39,160
- Oh, can you go any lower?

1554
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:40,201
- I mean-

1555
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:42,328
- Four seconds,
then sit all the way down, okay?

1556
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:43,564
And we won't have to
do it again.

1557
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:44,765
Wait till-I'll tell you when.

1558
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:47,138
- Are your eyes clean?

1559
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,143
- Yes.

1560
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:50,644
- Back up.

1561
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:56,074
- Look here, you got to start here.

1562
01:15:56,151 --> 01:15:58,051
- No, you take him.

1563
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,587
- Oh.

1564
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:01,020
- I said I'd share.

1565
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:02,056
- Don't you want me to share?

1566
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:03,091
- No, he's all yours.

1567
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:04,853
- I don't want him.

1568
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:06,292
- I think he's
lactose intolerant.

1569
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:16,104
- [growling]

1570
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:30,411
- Your wish...

1571
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:31,577
is my command.

1572
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:32,847
- # Ooh ooh #

1573
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:37,017
# Ooh ooh ooh ooh #

1574
01:16:37,092 --> 01:16:40,425
- I'll suck the roof off
your dick.

1575
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:41,462
Oh, God.

1576
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,430
- All right, cut, that's good,
we got it.

1577
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:44,988
- # Sisters #

1578
01:16:45,067 --> 01:16:46,659
# Doin' it for themselves #

1579
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:48,498
- Mike, stop looking at my ass.

1580
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:51,698
- [shrieking]

1581
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:54,708
- Those are some
big ass titties!

1582
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:57,836
- Yo.

1583
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:00,814
- My function.

1584
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:01,849
- Cha, cha, cha.

1585
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:11,459
- Yo.

1586
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:14,757
We was only yelling
'cause you was laughing, dawg.

1587
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:18,027
Come on, G money, just want to
learn in peace, word.

1588
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,125
- Yo, fuck that.

1589
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:21,931
This is the B class.

1590
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:24,234
Whatever the B says, goes.

1591
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,399
This is speech class,
motherfucker.

1592
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,409
That means it's all right
to make a statement.

1593
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:30,502
Suck this dick,

1594
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:31,705
fuck your brother in the ass,

1595
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:35,181
and eat your grandma's
greasy goochie.

1596
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:38,981
- This is Psychology, yo.

1597
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:41,249
- Whatever, white boy,
shut the fuck up.

1598
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:45,726
- You are so beautiful.

1599
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:49,321
- Those are the biggest
bikity tits I've ever seen.

1600
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:53,192
Cut.

1601
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:56,669
- Cut, cut.

1602
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:58,171
- # And the rest will follow #

1603
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,901
Did you just ash my ass?

1604
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:08,740
I am so abused,
I can't stand it.

1605
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:09,909
What?

1606
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:12,652
- Keep going.

1607
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:13,983
Be sexual.

1608
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:15,148
- Wha-ah?

1609
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:16,622
Am I-

1610
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,354
going to-

1611
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:22,397
[laughs]

1612
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:25,663
- Chris, zoom in on that.

1613
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:45,884
- Pretend gay.

1614
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:48,821
- Two minutes isn't enough,
though.

1615
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:54,050
- Doot, doot.

1616
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:55,494
- Oh, that's perfect, cut.

1617
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:05,136
- Whoo!

1618
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:07,801
Good, now, look,
'cause it's starting to go bad.

1619
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:14,003
Cut.

1620
01:19:14,082 --> 01:19:15,049
- Oh.

1621
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:16,880
Oh, pillow fight.

1622
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:19,250
They got-they're trying
to take my pants off, B.

1623
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:21,983
[laughter]

1624
01:19:22,057 --> 01:19:24,855
Come on, ladies,
you know I'm packin', come on.

1625
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:29,459
- We got it, man.
- Cut.

1626
01:19:29,531 --> 01:19:32,728
- I need a sandwich for that,
but all right.

1627
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:33,768
Pooh!

1628
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:37,202
- # I want to put a dick
in my mouth #

1629
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:40,673
# Joey be the inspiration #

1630
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:43,176
# He slams his balls
to the back of my throat #

1631
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:45,941
# I think I need
a tonsil operation #

1632
01:19:46,014 --> 01:19:47,845
# When you love somebody #

1633
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:51,215
# Just like Joey Powers #

1634
01:19:51,286 --> 01:19:53,015
# When you love somebody #

1635
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:56,922
# Just like Joey Powers #

1636
01:19:59,294 --> 01:20:00,488
- Okay, now lower the mic.

1637
01:20:00,562 --> 01:20:02,393
- Lower the mic,
open your mouth.

1638
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:04,022
- # When you lo- #

1639
01:20:08,503 --> 01:20:11,199
I am so abused,
I can't stand it.

1640
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:12,240
- Bob it in there.

1641
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:13,274
- Wha-
- Keep going.

1642
