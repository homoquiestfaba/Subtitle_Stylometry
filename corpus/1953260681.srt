11
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,487
Come on.
I wrote this one just for you.

12
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,782
I don't know why I let you
talk me into coming.

13
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,950
I think I'm the oldest sardine
in this can.

14
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,495
- Well, you don't look it.
- Well, that's true.

15
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,584
But it's your song.
You go up and sing it.

16
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,340
- You're the singer in our family.
- Honey, you sing.

17
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,882
Yeah, but you know
how to hold people's attention.

18
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,505
People love to just hear you talk.

19
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:31,471
Imagine how you're gonna knock it out
when you get up there.

20
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,622
All right, now.

21
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,082
Fellas. Fellas.

22
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,295
Nice.

23
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,926
Keep that applause going.

24
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,337
Give it up one more time for Black.

25
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,222
If you guys are having a good time,
say "oh, yeah."

26
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,428
Oh, yeah!

27
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,685
Please.
I went over everything with the band.

28
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:20,316
Please. I just want
to hear my song. Please.

29
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,477
Are you sure you want to do this?

30
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,739
- You, are you sure?
- That man is Black!

31
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:28,023
You hear that?

32
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,693
That's the sound of success, baby.

33
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,281
What you doing?

34
00:02:32,444 --> 00:02:33,991
Wait a minute.

35
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,201
Let's get a room.

36
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,708
Wait a minute. Bro, you see her?

37
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,370
Good God, woman.
What's wrong with you?

38
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,289
Coming up to the stage right now
is a beautiful young lady.

39
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,879
She's just as fine as she wants to be.

40
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,215
Now, this lady is a Detroit native...

41
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,881
...and she's never been
to the Discovery Club...

42
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:55,392
...so I want everybody
to show her some extra love.

43
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,895
Strutting up on-stage right now...

44
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:03,434
...is Sister Anderson!

45
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,443
Thank you.

46
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,183
So, what's up, Mr. Manager?

47
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,477
We gonna do some business or what?

48
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,520
Black, you got to lose
some weight, baby.

49
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:51,315
Man, you must be crazy.
Man, all the ladies love me.

50
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,236
And besides, this old belly
is what helps me sing.

51
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,912
TV's getting bigger-

52
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,823
- Clothes getting smaller.
- Yeah.

53
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,620
- You know, you'd be good on radio.
- Man, that's cold, man. That's cold.

54
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,260
Lord have mercy!

55
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,602
All right.

56
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,987
I see you looking. Sure, you're right.

57
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,989
You were so great.
But we have to hurry.

58
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,946
We have five minutes
to catch the bus.

59
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,861
Give it up one more time
for Sister Anderson.

60
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,405
My goodness gracious.

61
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,539
Excuse me. Excuse me.

62
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,120
It's Sister, right?

63
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,833
You gotta forgive me for earlier.
I was all wrong about you.

64
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,124
You were foxy up there.
Promise me you'll come back next week.

65
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,044
Maybe. Maybe not.

66
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,929
- But, baby, I gotta...
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

67
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,473
I really don't date younger men.

68
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,057
- No, no, please, you were so--
- I'm sorry, but we have to go.

69
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,563
Where can I find you?

70
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,064
Next time it's your turn.

71
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,073
Hi.

72
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,824
Hi. Thank you.

73
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,241
You were so good.

74
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,500
That was so fun!

75
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,464
Yeah, it was.

76
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,926
Next time, can you get through
the chorus before you do your solo?

77
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,385
Miss Thing, next time?

78
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,642
Yeah. I have a lot more songs.

79
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,225
Then you better get a lot more confident
and learn to sing them yourself.

80
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,684
Slavery is over.

81
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,724
Really? You're not gonna
sing anymore?

82
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,689
No.

83
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,696
Assume the position. What?

84
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,767
Y'all are late, and she's up.

85
00:07:22,317 --> 00:07:24,490
- Sparkle. Hush.
- Sorry.

86
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,622
Hurry.

87
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,376
What y'all doing in there?

88
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,647
My babies.

89
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,354
But I know y'all don't
love each other that much.

90
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,524
Sister and Sparkle, curl your hair.

91
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,689
Church in the morning.

92
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,902
You hear me?

93
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:06,244
Dolores, why is my window open?
I'm not trying to heat the outside.

94
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,580
Close it.

95
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,286
- Good night.
- Good night.

96
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,712
Is she gone?

97
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,875
Y'all heifers sneak out,
and I get fussed at?

98
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,544
Laugh at-- Laugh at that.
Is that funny?

99
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,216
Peace be with you.

100
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,132
And also with you.

101
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,021
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

102
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:39,027
You know, the Lord loves a church
full of happy, good-looking black folk.

103
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,562
Amen!

104
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,572
I know y'all happy
this morning, right?

105
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,823
Yes!

106
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,907
Ain't no frowns in this
church today, is there?

107
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,702
No frowns, no clowns,
not in church.

108
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,458
And look at the choir.

109
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,914
- How y'all doing this morning?
- Good!

110
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,375
- Levi, there she go.
- What? What?

111
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,712
Seven Sundays, seven churches,
and $7 later, and I find her.

112
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,468
- That light-skinned girl?
- There.

113
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,674
Oh, man.
Well, that's Tammy Anderson.

114
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,386
Yeah, man, she is smoking hot.

115
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,175
- Tammy.
- Two sisters. They all fine.

116
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,093
- They can all sing too.
- Is that right?

117
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,979
Sure, you're right.
But they mama crazy, though.

118
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:19,776
Y'all know better.

119
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,734
I know I can't sing,
but I can love to hear singing.

120
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,149
'Yes!
'Right?

121
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,618
I'll see you next week, right?
Okay. See you later.

122
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:36,956
Excuse me. You was at the Discovery
a few weeks ago.

123
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,878
- Bible study's at your house this week?
- Yeah, it is.

124
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,422
You know, you bad at this.

125
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,974
Just act natural.

126
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,139
Hi. My name's Stix.

127
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,599
Sparkle.

128
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,564
Sara.

129
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,147
- Who is my baby talking to?
- Nineteen ain't no baby no more, Emma.

130
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,231
What? No need in eyeballing me.
I tells the truth.

131
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,023
It's in my contract as your friend.

132
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,988
I'm telling you,
you hold on too tight to that one...

133
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,995
...she'll be unmarried
and back on your doorstep like Sister.

134
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,120
That's just temporary, okay?

135
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,206
Well, New York just spit her
right on back out, huh?

136
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,495
- No.
- You know what?

137
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,336
You worry about your daughter,
I'll worry about mine.

138
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:25,171
- I'm just saying.
- Yeah, what?

139
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,710
- Mom, I need some money.
- What?

140
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,675
They selling dinners in the basement,
and they going fast.

141
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:30,885
- Mom?
- Don't do it.

142
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,674
- Mama, please.
- Come with me.

143
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,969
- Now you stop.
- See y'all later.

144
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,018
Sparkle.

145
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,732
Let's go.

146
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,534
So I will see you
at Bible study, Sparkle?

147
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,327
Maybe.

148
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,883
<i>Another one of my white friends
came to me the other day and said:</i>

149
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,715
<i>"Where's the best place
to hide something from a Negro...</i>

150
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,255
<i>...and he'll never find it?"</i>

151
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,640
<i>I told him, "A work boot. "</i>

152
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,182
Y'all know he talking about us, right?

153
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,812
<i>People are always asking me...</i>

154
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,148
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

155
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,270
- Ms. Anderson, where's the bathroom?
- Down the hall, second door to the right.

156
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,562
Second door.

157
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,231
- Thank you.
- Yeah, second door.

158
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:33,736
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Satin Struthers.
Let's give him a hand.</i>

159
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:36,997
<i>Great job. Thanks for coming.
Isn't he funny?</i>

160
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,746
There you are.

161
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:43,457
Why you not in Bible study?

162
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,122
Haven't you heard?

163
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:48,508
I'm a heathen. Don't want to sit in there
and be a hypocrite.

164
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,634
Well, we already
got something in common...

165
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:54,388
...because I only came
just so I could ask you out.

166
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,094
The other door. To the right.

167
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,729
Other door. Sorry.

168
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,116
Oh, y'all like that, huh?

169
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,323
Funky dance, huh? You like that.
You like that music? Funky, huh?

170
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,954
It make you want to dance.
Come on.

171
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,239
Get it, Mama.

172
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,498
Yeah, Mama gonna get it.

173
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,875
Mama gonna get it.

174
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,627
And you will too.

175
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:27,915
You keep dancing like that,
you'll bring home a baby you can't feed.

176
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,170
Let's open our Bibles.

177
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:36,097
The deal was color television
for an hour of Bible study.

178
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,642
I lived up to my end,
now you live up to yours.

179
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:42,729
So let's go to Psalms 10--

180
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,312
Reverend Bryce called.
Says he need you to check the books.

181
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,648
The numbers are not adding up.

182
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,940
All right.

183
00:12:57,819 --> 00:12:59,241
What are you watching?

184
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,869
Oh, I love this song.

185
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,761
No, no. Too many hormones
unattended in here.

186
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,763
Let's go. Get out. Come on.
Sister, turn that TV off.

187
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,220
Thank you. Come on, let's go.

188
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,851
- Bye, Sparkle.
- See you.

189
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:25,059
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, baby.

190
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,098
It was just getting good.

191
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,608
See you tonight, Sparkle.

192
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,315
- Call you later.
- All right.

193
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:32,820
See you next time.

194
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,448
- Bye, Tammy.
- Bye, Tune.

195
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,570
Well, good night.

196
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,410
Good night.

197
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:51,749
Why are all the cute ones
always so stupid?

198
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,126
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

199
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,012
All right, I'm going.

200
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,598
Please, don't stop.

201
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,179
- What are you still doing here?
- That was beautiful.

202
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:31,146
Wait, that's your song?
You wrote that?

203
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,978
Only if you thought it was good.

204
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,484
I thought it was phenomenal.

205
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,895
Then I wrote it.

206
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,564
So did you write that song
your sister sang...

207
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,199
...at the Discovery a few weeks back?

208
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,412
- Yes, but she kind of made it her own.
- Wait a minute.

209
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:48,323
You wrote that song?

210
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,537
You wrote the song you were singing?

211
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,954
You wrote the songs in here too?

212
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,168
Yes.

213
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,173
What you gonna do with the music?

214
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,334
- Nothing.
- Why not?

215
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,846
Because my mother
would never let me.

216
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:07,555
Plus, I'm not the singer in the family.
Sister is, then Dee.

217
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,266
I sing in the choir
so I don't sit by myself in church.

218
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,772
No offense,
but I'm just hearing excuses.

219
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,603
- Excuse me?
- I don't mean to be rude.

220
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,769
I'm just passionate,
especially when it comes down to music.

221
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,688
That's why I'm here.
I'm staying with my cousin, Levi.

222
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,155
I'm from Kansas City.
We got a cool jazz scene down there.

223
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,742
I managed a few acts,
but the money's here in Motown.

224
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:29,998
And I want to be--
I am the next Berry Gordy.

225
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,705
I figure, his stomach ain't
growling like mine anymore.

226
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:36,246
Maybe he's leaving a lot
of steak and potatoes out there.

227
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,795
You mind if I hear that song again?

228
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,800
Still needs a lot of work.

229
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,483
Why won't you unpack?

230
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:03,648
I really don't plan on
being here that long.

231
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,908
You said that two months ago.

232
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,406
Sorry

233
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:16,958
Hey, don't ever be sorry
for telling the truth, Spark.

234
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,831
What was that?

235
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,301
Your Romeo is out there.

236
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,340
What?

237
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,449
You can't be throwing rocks
at my window.

238
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,779
My mother has a gun.

239
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:51,620
A gun. A big one.

240
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,781
There's an underground club tonight.

241
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,042
The kind that songwriters
don't want to miss.

242
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,747
You got to hear the music.

243
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,288
It's the stuff they ain't playing
on the radio.

244
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:04,004
- Come with me.
- He wants me to go hear music with him.

245
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:08,471
You've snuck out
of the house for less.

246
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,757
And I know just the dress.

247
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,222
You coming?

248
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,851
I ain't gonna bite you.

249
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,142
And how do I know that?

250
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,611
You're gonna have to trust me.

251
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,605
Can I tell you something?

252
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:44,438
I think your lyrics are too safe.

253
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,570
I mean, you got Dr. King, the war.

254
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,985
I don't think the metaphorical lyrics
gonna fly anymore.

255
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,823
What?
You impressed by my big word?

256
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:57,158
I was.

257
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,542
In the spirit of telling the truth,
can I tell you another?

258
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,705
- I wouldn't want you to lie.
- Then why do you lie to yourself?

259
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,791
About not wanting to sing?

260
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,256
I mean, Sparkle,
you writing these songs.

261
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,342
And you can sing.

262
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:18,301
- So why aren't you singing them?
- I'm no Diana or Aretha.

263
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,687
You know, you right.

264
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,848
You Sparkle.

265
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:29,191
Look, my mom
used to sing professionally.

266
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,698
She tried to break out
and it almost killed her.

267
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:36,031
So thank you, but I know
the realities of this business.

268
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,867
- I'm just doing it for fun.
- You know the realities?

269
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,123
- Oh, stop.
- I'm...

270
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,288
Listen.

271
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,749
What are you afraid of?

272
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,288
Your mom or your own voice?

273
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,338
Maybe you'd be like your mom
and never reach your goals.

274
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,338
But don't fall short of it
because you can't admit that you want it.

275
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,594
Okay.

276
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,054
I want to be better than Diana.

277
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,602
I want to be a star.

278
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,693
Thank you.

279
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,656
I had a great time tonight.

280
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,245
And just in case
I never get out of that house...

281
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,376
...thank you for making me
tell the truth.

282
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,473
Sparkle...

283
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,186
...do you want to be a star?

284
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,559
What?

285
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,025
- Do you want to be a star?
- Yes, I want to be a star.

286
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,485
No, I don't believe you.
Say it like you mean it.

287
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,616
Yes, I want to be a star.

288
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,527
Okay.

289
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,367
First you have to
write a song for your sister...

290
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,532
...something where she
can work the crowd.

291
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,372
Sparkle, you gonna have to get
over your fear of singing...

292
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,412
...because you and Dee
gonna back her up.

293
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,706
I mean, everybody loves
a good girl group.

294
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,046
Now, you tweak your lyrics,
make them more raw, more relatable.

295
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,802
But Fillmore, here we come.

296
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,089
Of course, you gonna
have to win Cliff Bells.

297
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:22,805
- You have to be invited to compete.
- Yeah, I know. I'm gonna work on that.

298
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:26,471
Now, I want you to work on your sisters,
and I'll work on Cliff Bells.

299
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,311
- And you'll be our manager?
- Of course.

300
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,726
Then you manage to get my sisters.

301
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,024
Do I have you?

302
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,860
Backup, remember?

303
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,946
Good night.

304
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,618
Cliff Bells?
Come on. I'm not embarrassing myself.

305
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,876
- Didn't Marvin Gaye get booed there?
- Yeah, but it made him better.

306
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,911
Now he's traveling, making millions.

307
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,955
Mr. Gordy is making millions.

308
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:56,968
However it may be, it was enough
to get him out of his mama's house.

309
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,008
You don't have to be rude about it.

310
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,798
Well, I don't really know
if you were asking me.

311
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,640
You never really looked my way,
so our eyes never got to dance, but I'm in.

312
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,975
And just to be clear,
I'm in it for the money.

313
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:12,733
Medical school is expensive, so, no,
you won't get 20 percent. Fifteen max.

314
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:16,362
And once I get accepted into medical
school you will have to replace me.

315
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,239
And if you pretend
like I don't exist going forward...

316
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,992
...I will turn my sisters against you.

317
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:26,247
Other than that, sounds like fun.

318
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,624
I'll wait for you guys outside.

319
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,630
I'll let you know.
My first day at Freeman's is tomorrow.

320
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,170
Working at a department store?

321
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,550
You ain't gonna make no money.
Sparkle!

322
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:48,348
Come on, Sparkle.

323
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,185
- Everything I said the other night, I believe.
- You used me to get to Sister.

324
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,693
You said it yourself,
Sister is the better performer.

325
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,317
Sparkle.

326
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,033
<i>Have you lost faith
in Mr. Johnson?</i>

327
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:10,120
<i>Well, I guess the president
would have to answer that question.</i>

328
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,831
Oh, who doesn't like Sidney Poitier?

329
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,963
- But the movie, you liked the movie?
- Yeah, I loved the movie.

330
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,342
More importantly, the next time
you take me out, you need to have a car.

331
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,548
Oh, I'm just--

332
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,338
I'm just waiting
on the right one to buy, baby.

333
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:28,510
Take me on a date on a bus
in the rain?

334
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,345
You're lucky I like you.

335
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:39,896
Look, I don't know any other way to be
than myself. I'm a straight shooter.

336
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:43,032
So here we go.

337
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,237
I like you too.

338
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,573
I do, and I want to be your man.

339
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:53,121
I'm serious. I ain't like all the other
jive guys that just want to do you.

340
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,536
I heard about your reputation.

341
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,296
I just think it's what guys say...

342
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,549
...when they see something beautiful
and know they can't have it.

343
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,554
So they'd rather tear it down
than make it something they want.

344
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,801
But I see your beauty.

345
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,933
Outside and inside.

346
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,435
I want to earn it.

347
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,645
Kind of like a job.

348
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:22,405
Yeah, so just tell me what you need
to fall in love with me.

349
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:24,816
Because whatever it is, I'll do it, girl.

350
00:25:24,982 --> 00:25:29,863
Whether you believe it or not,
I'm already in love with you.

351
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:37,287
I already heard it so much,
it all sounds like BS to me.

352
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:40,252
Maybe I better roll up
my sleeves then, huh?

353
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:43,793
- Hopefully not as high as your pants.
- What's wrong with my pants, girl?

354
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,587
- This is the style. You can see my socks.
- Change it.

355
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,427
Put some sugar in them shoes.

356
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:52,059
So I can sweet-talk
my pants down, huh?

357
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,225
What's this?

358
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:04,697
Open it up.

359
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,864
Oh, Levi.

360
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,951
I swear,
one day that's gonna be yours.

361
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:14,160
I promise you.

362
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,538
That's Satin Struthers.

363
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:24,550
Now that's some of the coolest trolling
I done seen in a long time.

364
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,254
- Did you see this cat, Ham?
- Yeah, I see him.

365
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,468
What's your name, brother?

366
00:26:30,631 --> 00:26:32,178
Levison, but they call me Levi.

367
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,475
Levi, here I am buying the real deal
for these women...

368
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,481
...and you tell me
you cut a picture out of a magazine...

369
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,608
...and just put it in a box?

370
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:43,610
I'm about to go get me
some scissors...

371
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:47,569
...and cut some pictures out of magazines
like your boy Levi right here.

372
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,910
Clip-clip, hussies.
Clip-clip, hussies.

373
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,666
Can I see it? Let me see that.

374
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:01,879
This is nice.

375
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:06,667
You got a good man here.

376
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,509
Yep.

377
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,929
Yeah, I used to eat in here
back in the day...

378
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,593
...when I was struggling.

379
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,138
This is some real cheap,
good food.

380
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:23,184
But I'm not gonna hold you guys.

381
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,145
Have a good night.

382
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,236
Levi.

383
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,447
Satin.

384
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,363
- Did you see her?
- You were so wrong.

385
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,960
Tammy, I should get you home.

386
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:42,745
Sure.

387
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,114
Mama was so pretty.

388
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,774
Oh, here's Dee's daddy.

389
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,944
Here's a good one of
yours and Sister's daddy.

390
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,238
Cute, but no good.

391
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,577
You got to watch out
for those cute ones, baby.

392
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,742
They make a lot of promises.

393
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:23,786
My goodness. Lookit here.

394
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,705
Gonna be the first store
in Detroit to have one of these.

395
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:29,170
- She's pretty, Mama.
- Oh, a chocolate mannequin.

396
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:30,755
Ain't it something?

397
00:28:30,918 --> 00:28:33,467
Dr. King said
we would have integration.

398
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,256
- That's right.
- Look what I found.

399
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,800
- What's that?
- The other, nicer you.

400
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,095
Sparkle, you go to lunch.

401
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,265
You come with me and let me try
to fit your behind in this dress.

402
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,145
- See how she do me?
- Come on.

403
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,231
She used to be real nice, girl.

404
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:51,780
She's in there somewhere.
Come on out, nice girl.

405
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:53,657
See you later.

406
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,039
I got Cliff Bells.

407
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,728
Got my first check.

408
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:05,978
Well, let me see.

409
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:11,398
Ninety-six dollars?

410
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:16,066
For two weeks of standing on your feet
and kissing rich white women's butts?

411
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,609
I am never gonna get out of here.

412
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:23,531
Stix said we can make
anywhere from 500 to $1000...

413
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:26,416
...if we win Cliff Bells' talent contest.

414
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,374
Don't say it all dry like that. Sell it.

415
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,414
So y'all talking to Stix now?

416
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:36,131
No. She was talking to Stix, I was
talking to her, now we're talking to you.

417
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:42,725
- You sure you want to do this?
- Yes.

418
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:45,352
You know, they say
you shouldn't eat where you--

419
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,729
- It's the other way around.
- She gets the point.

420
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:50,061
You guys, I thought about it...

421
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:54,524
...and I want to do this for me,
not for him.

422
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,152
So how much
we gonna make a week?

423
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:07,749
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Okay. Okay.

424
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,973
- Hello, Mr. Manager.
- Hey.

425
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,101
- Got them here, cousin.
- Surprised?

426
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:37,737
Yeah-- Not at all. Thank God.

427
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:49,166
Well, we come a dime a dozen,
don't we?

428
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,996
Coz, let me get the girls signed in.

429
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,791
Okay, okay, you do that.

430
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,341
Give them hell, baby.

431
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:04,131
- Levi.
- What's shaking, man?

432
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,482
Hey, can I get a picture?

433
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,656
- Here you go, man.
- Okay.

434
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,452
Satin.

435
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,375
Oh, picture-in-a-box brother.

436
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,630
Might not forget a face,
but I'll forget a name in a minute.

437
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,294
Levi, Satin. Levi.

438
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,135
Ladies, this is... See, I forgot already.

439
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,092
I got the girls signed in.

440
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,761
Righteous. Righteous.
Cousin, this is Satin Struthers.

441
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,350
- I know who it is. You're a funny man.
- Thank you.

442
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,265
This is his right hand, Hamster.

443
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,150
- Ham, man. Ham.
- Ham.

444
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,561
This is my cousin, Stix.

445
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,071
He's the manager of my girlfriend
and her sisters.

446
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,823
- They performing later tonight.
- I hope they're good.

447
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,405
I'm looking for a new act
to open up for my show.

448
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:09,617
Satin.

449
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,702
- Hey, Mr. Bell.
- Hey, how are you tonight?

450
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,118
- You know, hanging.
- Got a table for you in front.

451
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,287
Okay, cool. Come sit with us.

452
00:33:17,454 --> 00:33:20,424
I'd rather have the manager
than the boyfriend.

453
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:23,552
Boyfriend can't do nothing for me.
Come on over here.

454
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,053
Have a good evening.

455
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,089
Nice socks.

456
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,248
They were amazing.
Give them another round of applause.

457
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:02,466
Hey, I see we got Mr. Satin Struthers
in the audience tonight.

458
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:05,127
Show him some love, y'all. Yeah.

459
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,590
Looking good too.

460
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,755
Boy cleaner than a Sunday chitlin.

461
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,136
Yeah.

462
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,803
- Coming up next is another girl group.
- Okay, go out and look pretty.

463
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,849
- This isn't what we rehearsed.
- You want to win, don't you?

464
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,766
Go.

465
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,270
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...

466
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:26,406
...Sister and her Sisters.

467
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:50,263
Where in the world did you get
those church dresses?

468
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,393
What happened?
You forget the words?

469
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,020
<i>Where is she?</i>

470
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,228
Hey, get this man a drink.
He's gonna need one.

471
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:20,868
They good.

472
00:37:50,852 --> 00:37:52,820
I'll have you booked
all over the city.

473
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,856
Diana ain't got nothing on you.

474
00:37:55,023 --> 00:37:57,867
Hey, Sister, you were amazing.
You were amazing.

475
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:02,657
Sparkle, I need more of the songs.
You know, the kind we talked about.

476
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,495
- I can do that.
- All right.

477
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,331
- We need--
- We need new dresses, Mr. Manager.

478
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:10,418
We need to get home before
Mama wakes up and finds out we took--

479
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,709
- No, stole, the car. I'm not trying to die.
- No.

480
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,343
- Levi, drive careful.
- Yeah?

481
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:17,846
You got my future in this car.

482
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,056
Yes!

483
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,848
Daddy need three new, pretty dresses.
Eight ball, side pocket.

484
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:30,517
Damn!

485
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,399
You got this.

486
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:55,042
Thank you for your involuntary contribution
to Stix Incorporated Wardrobe Fund.

487
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:57,336
You was impressed by my big words,
weren't you?

488
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:00,176
Man, just shoot the damn ball.

489
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,724
They loved us!

490
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:37,061
- You finally hit that note, Sister.
- They didn't come to hear me sing, honey.

491
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:40,321
We need more money,
or you need to book us at a better club.

492
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,983
I know what you need
before you know.

493
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,992
Mr. Manager, that was out of sight.

494
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:51,374
Sparkle, I didn't know you had it like that.
And, Dee, you were good.

495
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,752
- Okay.
- But you... You.

496
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,379
Sister, you were on fire.

497
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,756
You'll mess up my lipstick.

498
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:01,668
Yeah, well, as much as I want
to mess up your lipstick...

499
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,552
...I gotta go to work.

500
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,258
Since when you working
the graveyard shift?

501
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,595
Since I got a woman
that's got needs, cousin. Look at her.

502
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,392
Satin.

503
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,682
- Didn't know you was still in the house.
- Yeah.

504
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,818
Let me introduce you to my family.
This is Sparkle. This is Dee.

505
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,446
- This is Satin Struthers.
- Pleased to meet you.

506
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,448
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

507
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,487
- And over here, in this corner, this is--
- We know each other.

508
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,325
Well, first, I'd like to congratulate you
on your performance.

509
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,164
- Thank you.
- And secondly...

510
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,875
...I'd like to give you something.

511
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,007
You know, dreams do come true.

512
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,215
Oh, my God.

513
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,636
- Levi!
- Trying to take my girl?

514
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:58,103
Get off me.

515
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,439
Let me have him!

516
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,529
- Come on, Levi.
- What's wrong with you, Negro?

517
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:07,238
Take me at least 30 minutes
to get my hair like this.

518
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,953
It's gonna get messed up
tonight anyway.

519
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:17,373
I'm sorry, sisters. I'm gonna go outside
and be waiting on you.

520
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:28,964
Oh, my God.

521
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,882
How could you do that to Levi?

522
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,302
Oh, Levi's a grown man.
He can handle himself.

523
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:36,096
Don't listen to her.
She's damn near 30 and not married.

524
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,060
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

525
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,519
But Levi loves you.

526
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:45,360
Spark, when you see a train that's gonna
get you to where you're trying to go...

527
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,615
...you can't wait to live.

528
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:49,822
You gotta jump on it.

529
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,782
He ain't got nothing else on me.

530
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,823
What he got?
More money? Better clothes?

531
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,957
What else he got?
He got nothing on me.

532
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,118
But she ain't worth it.
He ain't worth it.

533
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,754
- You my family. I'm your blood.
- Then act like it!

534
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,132
- Act like you're my blood!
- Hey.

535
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:09,296
If not for more than the drool that you
deposit on my couch every single night...

536
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:11,965
-...you should have had my back.
- I did have your back.

537
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,474
No, you didn't.

538
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:18,480
- You didn't have my back.
- Oh, coz.

539
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,857
<i>It's business.</i>

540
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,480
It's just business.

541
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,277
Levi, where you going?

542
00:43:34,529 --> 00:43:38,250
Levi, it ain't personal.

543
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,078
Just business, right?

544
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:55,349
Mercy, mercy, mercy!

545
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:58,641
Let's get this food out here,
Miss Emma.

546
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,227
The Lord loves good-smelling food.

547
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,188
Smells so good, Mama.

548
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,569
- Thank you, baby.
- Delicious.

549
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,239
Okay. Reverend,
will you bless the food, please?

550
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,617
Sister's not here yet.
She said she was coming.

551
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:16,496
Sparkle, those who do, do, baby.

552
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,781
Pastor, thank you.

553
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:20,746
Please, bow our heads.

554
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:22,376
Our Father in heaven...

555
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:25,709
...for this meal you have given,
we want to say thank you.

556
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:29,342
And...bless the ones who prepared it.

557
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,629
And, Lord, as we share it,
will you stay with us...

558
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,172
...and be our guest of honor?

559
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,218
But not just at this meal,
but God in our waking...

560
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,809
...God in our speaking,
God in our playing...

561
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:43,564
...God in our digesting...

562
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:47,728
...God in our working,
God in our resting.

563
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,896
In a world where so many are lonely...

564
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:54,158
...may we share this friendship
with joyful hearts.

565
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:59,414
- Amen.
- May this food, so fresh and fragrant...

566
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:03,452
...call forth reverence for you
in our souls.

567
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:06,963
As you give this strength
to our perishable limbs...

568
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,216
...so give us grace
for our immortal lives.

569
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:14,049
And let's not forget the blessings
on this family, Father God.

570
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:17,682
Lord, we thank you. Amen.

571
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,012
Amen!

572
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,894
Now, that's why black folks
can't get ahead, right there.

573
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,771
Not because we lazy.

574
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,900
It's because we're too busy praying
over 40 acres and a mule.

575
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:29,106
Now, by the time
black folks get to "amen"...

576
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:31,270
...the mule is dog food...

577
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:35,032
...and the 40 acres is sold
from underneath us.

578
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:36,613
Because we too busy praying.

579
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,614
Mom, this is Satin.

580
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:45,247
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure is mine, all mine.

581
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,717
Two dollars say
he doesn't make it to dessert.

582
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,799
Five says he doesn't get food on his plate.
Look at Mama's face.

583
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,381
- This is Mrs. Waters.
- Pleasure.

584
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,220
- And Tune Ann.
- Hey, Tune Ann.

585
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,055
- My sisters.
- Hey.

586
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:04,641
And this is the Reverend Bryce.

587
00:46:04,804 --> 00:46:07,023
What do you say, Rev?

588
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,478
Satin Struthers.

589
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:11,360
Yeah, yeah, I seen you on TV.

590
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,568
You were pretty hard
on the folk in Detroit after the riots.

591
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:19,152
Well, I was telling the truth, you know.
It shows a lack of intelligence...

592
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,491
...for someone to loot
their own neighborhood.

593
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:22,951
Well, people were angry.

594
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,991
At white people.

595
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:27,626
- Hell, go tear up they shit.
- What--?

596
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:31,251
Definitely not making it to dessert.

597
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:34,463
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Hail Mary.

598
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:36,715
That's Catholic.

599
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,672
It's still Christian, right?

600
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:42,516
I mean, come on.
I understand, I understand.

601
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:46,054
I was trying to get black people
to see it from a different perspective.

602
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,474
Burning and looting your own
neighborhood may be misguided...

603
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:54,062
...but at least those people out there
were trying to fight to change the system.

604
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,026
Now, with all due respect...

605
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:59,943
...you just trying to
make a dollar off their pain.

606
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:05,365
I bet you know a little bit more about
making dollars off of people's pain.

607
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,408
You packing them
into church every Sunday.

608
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:10,374
Giving them a show,
got them hooting and hollering. Yeah.

609
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,583
You know what, Rev?

610
00:47:11,746 --> 00:47:13,794
The only difference
between me and you...

611
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:17,005
...is you collect your fee at the pew...

612
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,170
...I collect mine at the door.

613
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:30,060
Well, Ms. Anderson...

614
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:34,068
...I guess now is a good time
for me to let you know...

615
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:37,571
...that I asked your daughter
to marry me.

616
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:41,405
Surprise.

617
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,661
He asked me last night.

618
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:47,699
Got down on one knee and told me
that he couldn't live without me.

619
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:52,917
Sister, you're going to marry this man?

620
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:57,676
He disrespects our home,
the reverend.

621
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,757
Oh, he's a comedian.
He was just trying to make us laugh.

622
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,673
He's a really good man.

623
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,841
Even goes to church sometimes.

624
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:09,763
Granted, it is for material,
but I am there...

625
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:11,431
-...and God knows my heart.
- Stop.

626
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,224
- I got a good heart.
- Stop.

627
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,393
He tithes.

628
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,449
Child, I think enough of you
to introduce you...

629
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:25,453
...to dentists and doctors
and accountants.

630
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,410
But, no, not you.

631
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,119
You want to whore with this coon.

632
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,205
- Mom!
- Sparkle.

633
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,593
Ms. Anderson,
I'm probably more of a Sambo.

634
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:48,389
I coon from time to time,
but Sambo's my go-to.

635
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,519
Baby, think more of yourself.

636
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:59,984
I know you're worried about getting older
and who's gonna marry you.

637
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,864
But get older, not desperate!

638
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,990
Desperate?

639
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,661
I'm doing a whole lot better
than you ever did.

640
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:11,453
Just keeping a man
is a whole lot better than you ever did.

641
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,993
- Ladies, please. I think--
- No, no, no, Reverend.

642
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,629
Let her get her attention.
She doesn't have much else.

643
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:20,921
- Maybe this is a conversation--
- Me getting a husband is not about me.

644
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:24,804
It's about her. It's not my fault
that she got knocked up at 16...

645
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,969
...and is trying to convince folks
she's the perfect mother...

646
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:31,682
...raised some good girls.
Sparkle's gonna follow up behind you...

647
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:34,848
...and be a little church mouse
and make dresses.

648
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,267
And if she's lucky,
she'll be a preacher's wife.

649
00:49:37,433 --> 00:49:41,563
Dee's gonna be a doctor,
and I'm just supposed to marry one?

650
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:44,403
Funny thing is,
maybe I could have snagged one...

651
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:46,818
...if you'd sent me to school
like these two.

652
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,988
But instead, I was at home,
raising your kids...

653
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,156
...while you were laid up
in your own vomit.

654
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:54,166
Sister...

655
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,953
...if you gonna tell my tragic story...

656
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,123
...give me the honor
of getting it correct.

657
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:02,299
Yeah, I passed out a few times.

658
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:05,086
Sure, I've had my moments.

659
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:11,760
But you've never, ever, ever
seen me laying in my own vomit.

660
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:13,553
Whatever you say, Mama.

661
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:19,942
The fact is, I was desperate back then.

662
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,398
Right now,
I'm trying to get myself out of here...

663
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,565
...and get myself more than
a color TV and half a room.

664
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,028
It's okay.

665
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,501
Well, we better go.

666
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:41,710
Ms. Anderson, thanks for what looked like
could have been a great dinner.

667
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,338
We better go.

668
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:50,677
Sister!

669
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:55,595
You leave my house,
there's no coming back.

670
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:57,896
Not this time.

671
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:12,411
Sparkle. Sparkle!

672
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,168
Are you still gonna be
part of the group?

673
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:28,461
That's not exactly
what was on my mind, Spark.

674
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,504
Yeah, sure.

675
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,103
Dee, say something.

676
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:46,569
Congratulations.

677
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,982
Thank you.

678
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,572
Thank you.

679
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,074
Come here.

680
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,586
I love you, Spark.

681
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,629
It's okay.

682
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,928
Where you want to go?

683
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:01,812
Anywhere.

684
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:26,332
Close your eyes.

685
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:39,346
Okay, you can open them.

686
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:42,515
Your cup of coffee, sir.

687
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,441
I appreciate it, baby.

688
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,320
You know, Daddy got to wake up
a little faster and a little stronger.

689
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:55,483
You'll be surprised with
what this gonna do when we make love.

690
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:01,243
Can't be any better than it already is.

691
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:26,476
- Are you catching a cold?
- No, I'm fine.

692
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,891
Okay, from "You bring out
the woman in me."

693
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,934
Five, six, seven, eight.

694
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,782
Can you not hit my hand every time?

695
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:41,115
Okay, come on, come on.
Five, six, seven, eight.

696
00:54:45,491 --> 00:54:48,165
Y'all ain't got to go home...

697
00:54:48,327 --> 00:54:49,499
...but you know the rest.

698
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:54,341
Oh, they were just leaving.

699
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,218
Baby, you got some
cab fare for them?

700
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,253
Cab fare?

701
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,680
You the one opening for
Aretha Franklin.

702
00:55:02,049 --> 00:55:05,428
I mean, hell, if I had any sense,
I'd be living off your ass.

703
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:11,517
- I'm funny, Sparkle? I'm funny?
- Yeah.

704
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,778
So you laughing at me
like them white folks that I coon for?

705
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,527
- No.
- Satin.

706
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,987
Well, you should.

707
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,824
That's how I'm paying
for all this heat you sucking up.

708
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,455
- Satin, I'm just--
- Let's just go. Come on, just go.

709
00:55:25,614 --> 00:55:27,161
Grab your book.

710
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,549
Ready for TV, Ms. Sparkle?

711
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,086
Oh, my God, Ms. Franklin!

712
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:40,300
Hello.

713
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,056
Today ain't the day
to be fashionably late.

714
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,262
You're fine.

715
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,802
Stix says Ms. Franklin's not here.
Running late.

716
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,306
I'm worried because that's gonna
cut it close to us getting home.

717
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,689
Sure is.

718
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,150
Do you have any more pins?

719
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:57,313
I'm running out of mine over here
and I need some more.

720
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,732
I can't get this thing on.

721
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,443
What happened to your face?

722
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,737
Oh, it ain't nothing.

723
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,530
He did that to you, didn't he?

724
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:08,324
I had an accident.

725
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,584
Oh, so, what,
you tripped and hit his fist?

726
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:11,994
Get out.

727
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:13,791
Excuse me?

728
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:16,586
I told you to get out of my face.

729
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:19,092
He's beating you,
and you're taking it out on me?

730
00:56:19,251 --> 00:56:22,050
- Just go. Go! Get out!
- No!

731
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,385
I don't need to hear this.

732
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:28,223
- Jeez, she's always in my business!
- Somebody ought to be!

733
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,138
- Shut up.
- You guys, stop. Don't do this!

734
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:32,477
Not tonight.

735
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,271
Please tell me
that's not what I think it is.

736
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:42,278
We have to open up for
Aretha Franklin tonight, right?

737
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,284
- Right?
- Right.

738
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:48,698
Well, Sister can't fly on one wing.
