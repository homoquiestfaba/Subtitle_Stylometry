[chuckles]

173
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,866
- I guess I kind of have been
on a dating rampage lately.
- Oh.

174
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:41,833
But before that,
I was in a monogamous
relationship for five years.

175
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:43,733
At least
I was monogamous.

176
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,300
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

177
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,300
I know that story.

178
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,300
I was married once,
although we sure as hell
didn’t make it any five years.

179
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,100
Technically, it was two,
but that’s only because
the divorce took six months.

180
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,566
Oh. Sounds ugly.

181
00:11:58,666 --> 00:12:01,233
Yeah. I was a total wreck.

182
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,466
I’m just now
pulling out of it.

183
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:07,466
So, are you looking to score
with your date tonight?

184
00:12:07,566 --> 00:12:09,400
I mean, assuming
she ever shows up.

185
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,900
Or are you looking for something
a little more substantial?

186
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,800
Substantial--
that’s a good word.

187
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,200
Yeah. I guess that’s
what I’m lookin’ for.

188
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,666
Me, too.
I mean, I don’t know.

189
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:24,466
Maybe I’m getting old,
but sex just isn’t the big deal
it was in my twenties.

190
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:27,066
Don’t get me wrong.
I’m still a big fan.

191
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,033
It’s just, there are times
when I’d gladly

192
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:31,366
trade in a good fuck for
a little decent conversation.

193
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:33,433
I know what you mean.

194
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:35,633
I did the whole singles bar,
one-night stand thing,

195
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:37,800
but after a while,
I just got so bored.

196
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,300
Some of the women I took home
actually seemed to be offended

197
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,866
- when I just wanted
to talk to them.
- Like about movies.

198
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:44,700
Exactly.
This one woman--

199
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,500
she had her clothes off
before I could shut the door.

200
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,000
And she’s staring at this poster
I have of <i>Amadeus,</i>

201
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,933
so I say, "Do you
like Milos Forman?"

202
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:56,366
And she says, "Well, I’ll try
anything, but usually
I like to be on top."

203
00:12:56,466 --> 00:12:58,133
[laughing]

204
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:06,066
I hope my date turns out
to be half as entertaining.

205
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,866
To tell you the truth,
I’m kind of nervous
about meeting him.

206
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:11,933
We really seemed to connect.
I mean, granted,
it was only through e-mail.

207
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:15,666
But I don’t know.
He seemed special.

208
00:13:15,766 --> 00:13:17,700
Did you exchange pictures?

209
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,933
No. I mean,
I didn’t want it
to be about that.

210
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:24,266
I mean, I know
it sounds corny, but we
actually talked about

211
00:13:24,366 --> 00:13:27,866
life, people, ideas.

212
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:31,366
He’s very funny
and bright.

213
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:33,866
And unlike most people
on the Internet, he can actually

214
00:13:33,966 --> 00:13:36,633
write and punctuate
a coherent sentence.

215
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,666
And plus, he’s
another movie nut.

216
00:13:38,766 --> 00:13:40,600
What’s his name?

217
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,700
His name is Todd.

218
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,933
Oh, my God.

219
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,866
[laughing]

220
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,966
You’re Kelly, aren’t you?

221
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,533
Yeah. Hi.

222
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,866
- [laughing]
- Jesus.

223
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:04,333
Goddamn it.
My brother did this.
He posted the ad.

224
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,333
In the men-seeking-men
section?

225
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,800
He’s probably laughing
his ass off right now.

226
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,033
What a son of a--

227
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:13,766
What a prick.

228
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:16,433
Well, I guess
you won’t be meeting people
through the Internet anymore.

229
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:23,533
I don’t know. I mean, other
than you being the wrong gender,

230
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:25,766
you seem great.

231
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,066
And you didn’t even inflate.

232
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,566
Excuse me?

233
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,866
I mean, you were honest
about your appearance.

234
00:14:32,966 --> 00:14:36,200
You are above average.

235
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,200
Oh.

236
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,466
Thank you.
That’s very sweet.

237
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,133
Listen, since you are
technically my date,

238
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:46,900
can I buy you
a cup of coffee?

239
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,400
Oh. Thanks.
That’d be nice.

240
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:56,600
- Black, no sugar, right?
- [chuckles]

241
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,133
Uh, low-fat latte
with whipped cream
and chocolate shavings.

242
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,400
Very good.
I’ll be back.

243
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,033
Okay.

244
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:09,933
Kelly.

245
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:11,500
Yeah?

246
00:15:14,033 --> 00:15:17,400
There’s an Ingmar Bergman
double feature playing tonight
at the New Beverly.

247
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,400
I’m not asking you out
like a date kind of thing.

248
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:25,766
I really just don’t know anyone
else who might enjoy Bergman.

249
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:28,166
[woman on TV]
Oh, yeah! Oh, my God!

250
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:31,800
[moaning]

251
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,033
[door opens]

252
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,000
[TV switches off]

253
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:46,266
Bedroom’s this way.

254
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
[chuckling]

255
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:04,366
[laughs]

256
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,800
[Todd moans]

257
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:16,033
[Kelly]
Oh, it feels good!

258
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,700
[sniffles]

259
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,733
Morning.

260
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,433
What-- What are you
doin’ up?

261
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,966
Where’s your, uh--
[whispering]
Where’s your friend?

262
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,400
He left.
Listen, about last night--

263
00:16:35,733 --> 00:16:38,800
I’m your brother,
and I love you, but...

264
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,400
yeah, I can’t
stay here anymore.

265
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,133
- Uh, no offense.
- You’re leaving?

266
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:44,866
Yeah, I-- I gotta go.
I’m sorry.

267
00:16:44,966 --> 00:16:47,666
No, no, no, no, no.
That-- That’s okay.
I understand.

268
00:16:47,766 --> 00:16:50,700
I wouldn’t want my lifestyle
to make you uncomfortable.

269
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,966
I’ll give you a call
in a couple days

270
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:55,166
and let you know
where I end up.

271
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:57,633
Okay, well...

272
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:00,966
- good luck.
- Yeah.

273
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,366
- So, take care of yourself.
- You, too.

274
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:09,333
No. I mean,
take care of yourself.

275
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:11,266
I don’t want you
getting the-- you know.

276
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:13,300
Nothing to worry about.
I promise.

277
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,866
Good.

278
00:17:14,966 --> 00:17:16,966
I’ll, uh, catch you later.

279
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:18,466
Yeah.

280
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:23,633
Yes. Thank you.

281
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,133
[door closes]

282
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,933
[quiet chatter]

283
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:49,533
Hi, Todd.

284
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,200
Ask her out.

285
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,300
She’s not datin’
that jerk anymore.

286
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,800
She’s not
interested.

287
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,300
She’s available.

288
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,366
Besides, we work together.
It’d be awkward.

289
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:03,533
Well, suit yourself.

290
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,766
- Hello?
- <i>[Todd]</i>
<i>Kelly.</i>

291
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:15,266
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Listen.

292
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:17,733
That little joke we played paid
off better than I’d imagined.

293
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:21,300
<i>My brother was so freaked,
he actually moved out.
Can you believe it?</i>

294
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,033
Free at last.
Free at last.

295
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:25,100
Thank God almighty,
you’re free at last.

296
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,600
- Amen.
<i>- Well, good.</i>

297
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,600
I’m glad I didn’t
disfigure myself for nothing.

298
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,733
I scratched my hand
climbing out your window.

299
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,433
- Oh, I’m sorry.
<i>- Oh, I’ll pull through.</i>

300
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:35,433
Hey, listen. You wanna
catch a movie tonight?

301
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:38,766
I can’t pronounce it--
that German film that made
such a splash at Sundance.

302
00:18:38,866 --> 00:18:41,200
Yes. I’ve been
dying to see that.

303
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,033
Jesus. You scared
the hell out of me.

304
00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:49,666
I’m not staying.
I just-- I forgot
a couple of things.

305
00:18:49,766 --> 00:18:52,633
- Yeah. A couple of my things.
- Oh, but I get so thirsty.

306
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,833
Oh, the toaster?

307
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,833
I need you to pick up Mom
at the airport.

308
00:18:57,933 --> 00:19:00,333
She gets in around midnight.
Here’s all her flight info.

309
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:02,300
What are you talking about?
Mom doesn’t fly.

310
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,033
Well, she does now.
I had to tell her, bro.

311
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:07,266
She’s your mom.
She has a right to know.

312
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:10,600
Barry, you jerk!
I am not gay!

313
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,466
I was just
yanking your chain.

314
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:15,500
Please.
You are gay. Look at you.
Look at the way you dress.

315
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,566
Look how you decorated
your apartment.

316
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,200
Look at those light bulbs.
That’s a gay light bulb.

317
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,900
- The sconces?
- See?

318
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,233
I wouldn’t know that ordinarily,
but my friend is a decorator.

319
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,533
- Oh.
- It’s a girl.

320
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:30,866
- Oh.
- Ready to go, handsome?

321
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:33,566
Oh, hello.

322
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,266
Oh.

323
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:40,700
Wow. I gotta go.

324
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,666
Don’t forget about Mom.

325
00:19:42,766 --> 00:19:45,166
- Barry--
- Bye.

326
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:48,000
He’s cute.

327
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,700
Are we having toast?

328
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,166
Ooh, whiskey.
Fantastic.

329
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:54,466
[laughing]

330
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:56,066
It’s not funny.

331
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:59,133
I’m sorry.
I’m sorry. It’s just--
[laughing]

332
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:00,633
- It’s not funny.
- It’s hysterical.

333
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:02,233
No. You don’t
know my mom.

334
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,500
I mean, when she gets
an idea in her head,

335
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,333
she’s like a Chihuahua
with a chew toy.

336
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08,066
Look, once you explain,
she’ll understand,

337
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,766
and you’ll have
a nice relaxing visit.

338
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:13,200
The only way this is gonna be
a relaxing visit is if she
stays somewhere else.

339
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,300
- I don’t suppose you have
a guest room?
- Uh, no.

340
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,433
And I don’t think staying
at my place is gonna convince
her of your heterosexuality.

341
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:19,766
Good point.

342
00:20:19,866 --> 00:20:21,333
It was great, wasn’t it?

343
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:22,866
Brilliant.

344
00:20:22,966 --> 00:20:24,966
So, do we have time
to grab some coffee,

345
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:27,033
or do you need
to go get your mom?

346
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:28,633
Yeah, I should go.

347
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:31,833
If I’m not there when
she gets off the plane,
she’ll take a cab

348
00:20:31,933 --> 00:20:35,066
and then spend
the rest of her visit talking
about how much it cost.

349
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:36,966
[chuckles]

350
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:39,500
Sounds like my mother.
Are you sure she’s not Latina?

351
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,766
[chuckles]
I think it’s a mom thing.

352
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:43,433
It transcends race,
creed and color.

353
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,100
[chuckles]

354
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,500
Well, thanks for
going out with me tonight.
I had a good time.

355
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,866
Okay, but we didn’t go out,
you know. We went out.

356
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,700
Well, we came out.
We didn’t come out.

357
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,866
We-- We physically went
to the movies together.

358
00:21:10,966 --> 00:21:14,033
- But not together.
You know, just--
- [laughs]

359
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:18,400
Wow. And we almost
made it through the evening
without a gay panic moment.

360
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,233
I’m sorry.

361
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,766
In fact, I’m sorry
about the whole night.

362
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:27,166
I feel like I spent
the entire time
complaining about my mother.

363
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,666
I don’t mind listening.
That’s what friends are for.

364
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,000
I guess I don’t have
a lot of friends.

365
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,566
Cheryl and I had
couple-friends,

366
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:38,066
but she seems to have gotten
custody of most of them.

367
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:42,233
Right. It’s hard
meeting people in L.A.

368
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:45,833
Well, thanks for listening.
You’re a good guy.

369
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:47,400
I’m a great guy.

370
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,033
- It’s too bad
it’s wasted on you.
- [chuckles]

371
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:53,433
Yeah? Well, I’m still
trying to get over the fact
that you’re not a woman.

372
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:55,566
I think I was
half in love with you.

373
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:57,766
I mean, with the woman
I thought you were.

374
00:21:57,866 --> 00:21:59,633
Really?

375
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:01,666
You give great e-mail.

376
00:22:01,766 --> 00:22:04,466
Stop.
You’re gonna
make me cry.

377
00:22:04,566 --> 00:22:07,000
Okay. Time to go.

378
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,833
[laughs]
Quit being so straight.

379
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:12,833
A hug is not
going to kill you.

380
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,800
Okay.

381
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,833
Oh, that’s very nice.

382
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,466
- Good night.
- Good night...

383
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:24,066
sweetie.

384
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:40,933
Oh, honey!

385
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:44,966
[crying]

386
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, baby.

387
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,533
Mom, I’m fine.

388
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:54,400
Everything’s fine.

389
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,033
Oh, of course you’re fine.
I just wish you’d
told me sooner.

390
00:22:57,133 --> 00:22:58,633
That’s just it.
There’s nothing to tell.

391
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:01,166
It was just a misunderstanding.
I’m not gay.

392
00:23:01,266 --> 00:23:04,166
You don’t have to hide anymore.
Your brother told me everything.

393
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:07,500
Mom, I was just playing
a joke on him.

394
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,200
Remember?
Like when we were kids?

395
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,066
Well, I remember when I caught
you with that Robert naked,

396
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:14,700
and I-- I tried to tell myself
nothing was going on

397
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,766
and all little boys
are curious.

398
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:19,466
Nothing was going on.
All little boys are curious.

399
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:23,333
Yeah, well, your father warned
me that I coddled you too much.

400
00:23:23,433 --> 00:23:26,633
- Do you think that was it?
- Mom, you did not coddle me.

401
00:23:26,733 --> 00:23:28,266
Right, right.
So it’s just genetics.

402
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:29,800
That’s what
everyone is saying.

403
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,866
I mean, that no one blames
the mother anymore.

404
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:34,466
There’s nothing for you
to be blamed for, Mom.

405
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:37,600
Right, because
being gay is okay.

406
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Really, nobody is to be
blamed for anything.

407
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,133
Although I do wish
that your father,
God rest his soul,

408
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:49,400
could have turned off
the television for five minutes
and played with his son!

409
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,700
Mom, you are not listening.

410
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,200
Okay?

411
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,266
Let’s go
to the baggage carousel.

412
00:23:58,366 --> 00:24:00,133
I have two large bags.

413
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:01,766
How long are you
planning to stay?

414
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:04,166
For as long
as you need me, honey.

415
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:08,133
Okay.

416
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,533
All right.

417
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,166
Mother, about this
whole misunderstanding--

418
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:29,233
- [snoring]
- Oh, my God.

419
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:35,000
- [phone rings]
- <i>[Todd’s voice] Frankly,</i>
<i>my dear, I don’t give a damn</i>

420
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,000
<i>if you leave a message.
[beeps]</i>

421
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,433
Hey, Mom.
Are you there? Pick up.

422
00:24:41,233 --> 00:24:44,466
Okay, well,
I’m gonna try to get off work
early so we can talk.

423
00:24:49,066 --> 00:24:52,100
Honey? Todd?
This is Mrs. Orsini.

424
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,266
She has a boy like you.

425
00:24:54,366 --> 00:24:55,900
A programmer?

426
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,466
You don’t have to
pretend with me, Todd.

427
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:02,933
Mrs. Orsini is the head
of the Los Angeles PFLAG--

428
00:25:03,033 --> 00:25:06,133
Parents and Friends
for Lesbians and Gays.

429
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:08,633
She and her husband marched
in this year’s parade.

430
00:25:08,733 --> 00:25:11,500
We march every year.
Did you march, Todd?

431
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,700
Could you excuse us
for a moment? Mother,
I’d like to talk to you.

432
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,733
What are you doing
bringing her? I told you I was
gonna explain everything later.

433
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:22,533
I just thought it would be
helpful to have someone here
who’s been through it before.

434
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:24,433
She hasn’t been through
this before. Trust me.

435
00:25:24,533 --> 00:25:26,400
Todd, please don’t be
upset with your mother.

436
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Now, this is a very
hard time for her.

437
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,366
She’s really
trying to understand
and support you.

438
00:25:30,466 --> 00:25:32,866
I appreciate that,
and I’m sure PFLAG is
a wonderful organization--

439
00:25:32,966 --> 00:25:34,833
Honey, maybe I didn’t
see the signs.

440
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:37,600
- Maybe Cheryl
turned you against women.
- I have nothing against women.

441
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,433
Ever since Cheryl, there’s
been no one special in his life.
He hardly dates anyone anymore.

442
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:44,200
I date.
I just don’t necessarily
tell you about it.

443
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,366
That’s very common among
closeted men who are
just coming to terms

444
00:25:47,466 --> 00:25:49,066
with their sexuality
in mid-life.

445
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,433
I’m not clo--
What do you mean "mid-life"?

446
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:54,333
You’re 35, honey.
I mean, the life span
of the average American male--

447
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:57,433
All right, whatever!
I am not gay,
closeted or otherwise.

448
00:25:57,533 --> 00:25:59,100
It’s best not
to force the issue.

449
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,600
Wait till he wants
to talk about it
and comes to you.

450
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,800
I am talking about it.
I’m just not gay.

451
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:07,066
- Feel free to come to our
meetings while you’re in town.
- Oh, thank you.

452
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:10,766
And I will contact you
with the information
for your local chapter.

453
00:26:10,866 --> 00:26:12,533
Oh, that’s very helpful.

454
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:14,866
Thank you so much,
Mrs. Orsini.

455
00:26:14,966 --> 00:26:16,533
Oh, well,

456
00:26:16,633 --> 00:26:19,900
I remember how hard it was
for my son and me.

457
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:25,200
Good luck.

458
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:38,833
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Donovan.

459
00:26:38,933 --> 00:26:42,700
I just want to tell you, you
have nothing to be ashamed of.
My nephew’s gay.

460
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,200
What?

461
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,166
I said my nephew is gay.

462
00:26:46,266 --> 00:26:47,933
Shh!

463
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:50,300
You know,
you should meet him.
Honey, he’s a dentist.

464
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,466
No, thanks.

465
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:54,900
Oh, right.
You’re seeing somebody.

466
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,133
Oh, well,
I hope it works out.

467
00:26:57,233 --> 00:27:00,066
But if it doesn’t,

468
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:03,966
my nephew is very sweet.

469
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:30,466
Is there something
I can help you with?

470
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:35,066
Yeah.
Uh, I’m looking for Kelly.
Does he work here?

471
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,833
He owns the place.

472
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:38,966
Do you have
an appointment?

473
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:41,633
No, I’m, uh--
I guess I’m a friend.

474
00:27:41,733 --> 00:27:43,533
You guess?

475
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:45,100
Could you just
tell him Todd’s here?

476
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,300
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

477
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,666
What are you doing here?
[gasping]

478
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:02,700
Man-scaping? Quick trim?
Massage?

479
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,233
- Brazilian wax?
- You have to talk to my mother.

480
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,733
[gasps]
So soon? Are we asking
for her blessing?

481
00:28:07,833 --> 00:28:11,900
This isn’t funny.
Nothing I say seems to
convince her that I’m not gay.

482
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,933
And you think talking to me
is gonna help?

483
00:28:14,033 --> 00:28:15,533
Maybe if you explained
what happened,

484
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:17,466
she’d see the whole thing
was a joke.

485
00:28:17,566 --> 00:28:20,100
All right.
Sure. I’ll try.

486
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,033
- Really?
- Yeah. Why not?

487
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,066
Can you come by
tonight after work?

488
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:26,900
Well, I was
going out, but--

489
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,066
All right.
If it’s that important
to you, I’ll be there.

490
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,133
Thanks.
You’re a pal.

491
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:34,633
You’re welcome.
[chuckles]

492
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:36,633
- I’ll see you tonight.
- Okay.

493
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:38,900
I’m just gonna take this.

494
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,166
Oh. Okay.

495
00:28:57,266 --> 00:28:58,666
Hey, Bonnie.

496
00:28:58,766 --> 00:29:00,200
Hey, baby.

497
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:03,866
You know,
that is so funny.

498
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:07,666
I was just sitting here
wishing there was
a half-naked man in the room.

499
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:11,133
You think about sex more than
any woman I have ever known.

500
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:14,633
- You know I’m a gay man trapped
in a straight woman’s body.
- [laughs]

501
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:16,500
Why the mad rush?
Got a hot date?

502
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,666
I told Todd
that I would help him

503
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:21,133
with a little problem
he’s having with his mother.

504
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:22,633
Todd?

505
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:24,500
Yes.

506
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,200
Excuse me?

507
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,300
Todd, the straight guy?

508
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,200
Yes.

509
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,366
- So, what,
are you dating him now?
- No.

510
00:29:34,466 --> 00:29:36,333
You know I don’t
go after straight guys.

511
00:29:36,433 --> 00:29:38,600
- Mm-hmm.
- I don’t.

512
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,400
- Mm-hmm.
- Shut up.

513
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,600
So, what, you don’t find him
the least bit attractive?

514
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,333
I didn’t say that.
And that’s beside
the point.

515
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:51,300
- Oh, what is the point?
- The point is that I can have
friends I don’t sleep with.

516
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,800
I have you, don’t I?

517
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,433
Yeah, you had me,
remember?

518
00:29:55,533 --> 00:29:58,133
That was 10 years ago,
and you took advantage of me.

519
00:29:58,233 --> 00:30:01,100
And I still
let you be my friend.
So my point still holds.

520
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,300
Well, my point is that I don’t
want to see you get hurt.

521
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,966
Bonnie, I’m a big boy,
okay?

522
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:09,800
I’m not gonna fall for him.

523
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,333
What do you think?
Hat? No hat?

524
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:15,666
I think you’re a freak.
What the hell is that?

525
00:30:15,766 --> 00:30:17,900
- [laughs]
Shut up. I love you.
- Love you.

526
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,800
- Don’t wait up.
- I won’t.

527
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,733
Don’t get drunk.

528
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:24,633
[scoffs]
That’s boring.
Men.

529
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,600
I’m not ready
to meet your boyfriend.

530
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,633
Mom, the whole reason
he’s coming over

531
00:30:30,733 --> 00:30:33,733
is to establish
he’s not my boyfriend.

532
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:38,400
Of course, I would meet
anybody that you care about.
Really, I would.

533
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,033
It’s just that...
this is so new.

534
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:44,800
Mom, the only
new thing going on

535
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,400
is that I have a gay friend,
not a lover, a friend.

536
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,566
Gay people are so sensitive
about terminology.
[ sighs]

537
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:53,666
[knock at door]

538
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:03,133
Whazzup, whazzup,
whazzup?

539
00:31:03,233 --> 00:31:06,666
- How you doin’?
- Okay, I think
you misunderstood.

540
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:09,200
We don’t need to convince
her that you’re straight,
just that I am.

541
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,500
Oh, thank God.
It was all too <i>La Cage</i>
<i>Aux Folles</i> for me.

542
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,866
- Oh, you must be
Mrs. Mull-er.
- Myoo-ler.

543
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:16,733
Myoo-ler.
Mull-er, Myoo-ler.

544
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:20,000
- So sorry.
Such a pleasure to meet you.
- It’s nice to meet you, too.

545
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,766
Well, I really
can’t stay, but--
Oh, that’s so sweet.

546
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:28,800
Okay. Todd wanted me
to come by and explain
about the other night.

547
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,866
There’s nothing to explain.
I understand.
I’m an adult.

548
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:34,766
Well, nothing happened.
Your son was a perfect
gentleman... damn it.

549
00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:36,666
- Kelly.
- What?

550
00:31:36,766 --> 00:31:40,000
I’m sorry. I thought I was
up to this, but I’m not.
Please excuse me.

551
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,300
Mother, wh-where
are you going?

552
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,300
I’m sorry.

553
00:31:45,566 --> 00:31:47,766
- [door closes]
- [Todd]
Mom!

554
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:50,266
- Mom!
- [knocking at door]

555
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,066
Mother!

556
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:55,133
You know, I just thought
a little levity might
lighten the mood.

557
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:58,000
- [knock at door]
- Mom. Oh, God.

558
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,366
It’s not your fault.
She’s a lunatic.

559
00:32:00,466 --> 00:32:02,533
No, no, she’s... sweet.

560
00:32:02,633 --> 00:32:04,800
- [pounding on door]
- Mom. Mom, I’m serious.

561
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,633
- Would you please
open this door?
- Let’s put a mirror in here.

562
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:11,066
- Mom!
- Listen, I’m
going to go see...

563
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:13,700
that new Woody Allen movie
tonight with some friends.

564
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,133
- Do you want to come along?
- We have to see that.
Friends?

565
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:19,800
Yeah, friends,
a group of gay men.

566
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,766
You’d be the token
heterosexual.
Scared?

567
00:32:22,866 --> 00:32:25,566
No. But...

568
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:28,133
I don’t know.
Maybe I should stay
here with my mom.

569
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:30,266
All right, yeah.
I understand.

570
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:33,033
- I’ll talk to you later.
- All right. Wait.

571
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,766
She’s probably going to
be in there all night.
Let’s just go.

572
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,500
This is the best you
could do for straight?

573
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,733
- I love her.
- Come on.

574
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:47,233
Do we have to see
this Woody Allen thingy?

575
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,933
A new Tom Cruise
movie’s playing.
You get to see his butt.

576
00:32:50,033 --> 00:32:52,333
You’ve seen that movie
five times already.

577
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:55,500
He’s crazy now,
but I think he’s
still kind of hot.

578
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,833
- Not as hot as you, baby.
- Yeah.

579
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:01,433
- Todd! Is that you?
- Clayton.

580
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:04,133
Hi. How’re you doing?
Good to see you.

581
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,133
You remember
my partner Andy.

582
00:33:06,233 --> 00:33:07,966
Andy! What’s up?

583
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:10,333
- You’re hurting him.
- Sorry, sorry.

584
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:13,566
- Nice night, huh?
- Oh.

585
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,800
Oh, yeah.
Um...

586
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,966
This is my friend Kelly.
Friend.

587
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:23,066
And these are his
friends, um, uh...

588
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:26,000
- Matt and, uh--
- Anthony.

589
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,033
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Nice to meet you.

590
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,800
So are you here to see
the Tom Cruise film?

591
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,800
Yeah, yeah--
Uh, no, Woody Allen.

592
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,366
Yeah, Woody Allen.
He shows his butt
in this one.

593
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:40,400
I mean, Tom Cruise does,
not that I know that.

594
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,133
I just, uh...
Or care.
I don’t even...

595
00:33:44,233 --> 00:33:46,733
Well...

596
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:49,066
- have fun.
- [Matt]
You, too.

597
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,233
- Bye.
- Nice to meet you.
Bye.

598
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,466
He’s going to tell
everyone in the office
that I’m gay.

599
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:55,733
- What do you care?
- I don’t know.

600
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,833
- It’s just weird.
- I know what you mean.

601
00:33:57,933 --> 00:34:01,266
People are always
thinking I’m straight.
It’s so annoying.

602
00:34:01,366 --> 00:34:03,333
- [Kelly laughs]
- What?

603
00:34:03,433 --> 00:34:05,366
I’m serious.
It happens.

604
00:34:05,466 --> 00:34:06,666
- [Kelly]
Yes.
- Oh, my god.

605
00:34:06,766 --> 00:34:08,800
Sorry I’m late.
I was getting my hairdo.

606
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,700
Whatever.
I just want to get tickets
so we can get good seats.

607
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,400
- I’m so hungry.
- I know. Me, too.

608
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,400
- This place is great, though.
- Yeah?

609
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,666
- [horn honks]
- Fuckin’ faggots!

610
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,900
- Asshole!
- Fascist little punks!

611
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,733
[Kelly]
Are you okay?

612
00:34:24,833 --> 00:34:26,833
- I’m bleeding.
- Oh, my God,
you’re bleeding.

613
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:28,833
Okay, wait.
Let me see.

614
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,833
It’s not deep.
You’ll be all right.

615
00:34:30,933 --> 00:34:32,666
An inch lower, and you
could’ve lost your eye.

616
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:34,666
- Did somebody see
their plates?
- What for?

617
00:34:34,766 --> 00:34:36,666
They’re just kids.
The cops won’t
do anything.

618
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:38,666
Now you know
what we go through.

619
00:34:38,766 --> 00:34:40,666
Being gay isn’t
all about disco music
and sparkle dust.

620
00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:42,500
But this is
your part of town.

621
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,733
Apparently, somebody
needs to be better
about border patrol.

622
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,133
God.

623
00:34:50,633 --> 00:34:52,533
- Is it still bleeding?
- What do you think?

624
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:55,866
It looks fine, but we
should go inside and put
some iodine on it.

625
00:34:55,966 --> 00:34:58,233
It’s fine.
I can do it myself.

626
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,800
[sighs]
What--

627
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,200
- You’re still a little shaken.
- I don’t want to
wake my mother.

628
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,866
Yeah, I’m a loud queen,
but I do know how
to whisper, you know.

629
00:35:08,966 --> 00:35:12,600
- It’s not necessary.
- It’s going to get infected
while we stand here arguing.

630
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,366
Let’s just go inside
and fix your face.

631
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:19,466
It’s fine.
I can do it.

632
00:35:19,566 --> 00:35:22,066
[whispering]
Sit down.
Where are the Band-Aids?

633
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:24,066
- In the top drawer.
- Okay.

634
00:35:28,566 --> 00:35:30,633
Let me see.

635
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,166
I hope this cut didn’t ruin
the evening for you.

636
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,166
It’s not the cut.

637
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:39,133
I know.

638
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:42,700
We weren’t doing anything.
It’s not like we were
holding hands.

639
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,200
And that would have
made it okay?

640
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,600
Well, I mean,

641
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,166
I can see how
that might make some
people uncomfortable.

642
00:35:51,266 --> 00:35:52,966
People?

643
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:55,800
Not you?

644
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,633
Well, discomfort’s
one thing,

645
00:35:57,733 --> 00:36:01,200
but how do you get from that
to throwing bottles?

646
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,333
People deal with discomfort
in strange ways.

647
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:07,133
Maybe this kid
is actually gay,

648
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:11,033
and this is his way of
fighting those feelings.

649
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:13,033
God, what
a depressing thought.

650
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:17,900
Well, not everybody is
as accepting as your mother.

651
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,733
Don’t remind me.
I still need to straighten
out that whole mess.

652
00:36:21,833 --> 00:36:25,900
What you need is
a good night’s sleep

653
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,133
and a hairstyle.

654
00:36:28,233 --> 00:36:30,166
What do you mean?
I like my hair.

655
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Really?

656
00:36:36,433 --> 00:36:39,300
You’ve got to be completely
honest with me, okay?

657
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,366
- What?
- Am I losing my hair?

658
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,366
You are not losing
your hair.

659
00:36:44,466 --> 00:36:47,666
- Look right there.
- I’m looking right there.
I see hair.

660
00:36:47,766 --> 00:36:50,233
- You saw hair?
- I saw hair.

661
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,233
You need
a little product.

662
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,400
No, I don’t want to
gay it all up.

663
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,833
Is gel gay, huh?

664
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:58,833
A little dollop.

665
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:00,766
Dollop sounds gay.

666
00:37:01,866 --> 00:37:03,366
It does sound gay.

667
00:37:06,566 --> 00:37:08,400
Hey, Todd.

668
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,366
How was that movie
last night?

669
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:14,266
It was great.
Yours?

670
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:18,133
So-so. We did get to
see Tom Cruise’s ass,
so it wasn’t a total loss.

671
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:20,600
Listen, you want
to grab some lunch?

672
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,400
- Oh, my God, what
happened to your eye?
- Uh... scratched it.

673
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,066
It’s nothing.

674
00:37:25,166 --> 00:37:28,033
Oh. You want to go
to that new Indian place
down the street?

675
00:37:28,133 --> 00:37:29,766
That sounds good.
Yeah.

676
00:37:29,866 --> 00:37:31,666
Oh, love the hair.

677
00:37:31,766 --> 00:37:34,900
[Indian sitar music playing]

678
00:37:46,333 --> 00:37:49,733
Okay, listen.
There’s something
I need to explain.

679
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:51,833
Kelly seems really nice.
How long have you
been seeing him?

680
00:37:51,933 --> 00:37:53,900
He is nice,
but we’re not dating.

681
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,066
Oh, so you’re still
in the market?

682
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:59,400
Andy works with
this really great guy.
The two of you would hit it off.

683
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,400
Okay, I’m not
making myself clear.

684
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,900
I am straight,
heterosexual, 100%.

685
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,900
Okay, tofu tikka masala.

686
00:38:09,266 --> 00:38:11,166
Can’t a guy go
to the movies

687
00:38:11,266 --> 00:38:13,566
with a group of gay men
without being gay?

688
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,900
- Is there some sort
of law against that?
- Mm-mm.

689
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,133
Of course not.
Happens all the time.

690
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:20,500
You still
don’t believe me.

691
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,900
It’s fine.
You’ll come out
when you’re ready.

692
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,766
No, seriously,
I’m straight.

693
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
- Do you swear
on Judy Garland’s grave?
- What?

694
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,133
Now, see that...

695
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:36,566
would make perfect sense
to a gay man.

696
00:38:41,266 --> 00:38:43,833
- [phone ringing]
- [computer keys clacking]

697
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:45,500
This is Todd.

698
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,866
<i>[Kelly]
You want to get
a drink after work?</i>

699
00:38:47,966 --> 00:38:50,333
There’s this little
place right near here
makes a great mojito.

700
00:38:50,433 --> 00:38:52,333
You’ve had those, right?
Trendy, but who cares?

701
00:38:52,433 --> 00:38:54,666
- <i>It goes down easy.</i>
- Kind of like you.

702
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,666
<i>[laughs]
Aren’t you feisty today?</i>

703
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:58,833
Don’t believe everything
you read on bathroom walls.

704
00:39:01,066 --> 00:39:03,566
Ah, I’m glad you can
laugh about your ex.

705
00:39:03,666 --> 00:39:05,800
I’m not quite sure
I’m at that point yet.

706
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,233
Well, I can only laugh about it
because I know he’s miserable.

707
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:11,600
If he was living happily
ever after with that twink,

708
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,100
I’d be a tad bitter.

709
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,533
Yeah.

710
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:22,566
So you didn’t tell me
this was a gay bar.

711
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:25,133
- You didn’t ask.
- Do you only go to gay places?

712
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:28,133
I mean, the movie theater,
the coffee house.

713
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,366
I suppose you shop
at a gay supermarket.

714
00:39:30,466 --> 00:39:33,600
Obviously.
Supermarkets are great
places to pick up men.

715
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,566
I’ll bear that in mind.

716
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,466
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

717
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:40,233
Sure. You guys
are a cute couple.

718
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,300
- How long have you
been together?
- We’re not.

719
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,366
- Two years.
- We’re not a couple.
He’s joking.

720
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:46,866
Well, whatever.
You look happy together.

721
00:39:46,966 --> 00:39:49,266
Thank you.
We are.

722
00:39:49,366 --> 00:39:50,933
- [laughing]
- Just--

723
00:39:51,033 --> 00:39:52,766
- Hi, Todd!
- [guffaws]

724
00:39:52,866 --> 00:39:55,233
I didn’t know you knew about
this little watering hole.

725
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:57,633
I didn’t.
Kelly invited me.

726
00:39:57,733 --> 00:39:59,666
Yeah.
We met last night.

727
00:39:59,766 --> 00:40:01,500
I remember.
[laughs]

728
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,933
So I just wanted
to say hello.

729
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:07,400
I guess I’ll leave
you two alone.

730
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,033
Judy Garland’s
grave, my ass.

731
00:40:14,433 --> 00:40:16,900
Mom? What are you doing?
Are you okay?

732
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,900
Oh, yeah.
There’s a message for you.

733
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:26,233
[answering machine beeps]

734
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:28,233
<i>[Clayton] Hi, Todd.
I forgot to mention,</i>

735
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,233
<i>there’s a group you
might be interested in.</i>

736
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:33,166
<i>It’s called GLIPA--
Gay and Lesbian
Programmers of America.</i>

737
00:40:33,266 --> 00:40:35,200
<i>I’ll e-mail you next time
we have a meeting.
Bye.</i>

738
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,133
- [beeps]
- So...

739
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:41,466
you’ve come out at work,
but you still can’t talk
to your own mother.

740
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:45,733
I have not come out at work.
He’s just confused.

741
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:48,833
Freud called that
projection.

742
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:51,500
Mom, I realize
this looks bad--

743
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,733
No, honey, not at all.

744
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,400
There’s nothing bad
about your being gay.

745
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,700
- It’s just what you are.
- But it’s not what I am.

746
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,366
Darling, I never
told this to a soul,

747
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:09,466
but I knew you were gay
when you were a little boy.

748
00:41:09,566 --> 00:41:11,933
You didn’t enjoy sports
like the other boys.

749
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:13,433
I liked sports.

750
00:41:13,533 --> 00:41:15,966
Well, let’s say
you liked reading more.

751
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:18,466
Mom, I was smart,
not gay.

752
00:41:18,566 --> 00:41:21,700
Of course you were smart,
and you were sensitive,

753
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,133
and you loved the theater
and music and movies.

754
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,166
God, you’re right.
I do sound gay.

755
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:32,400
And when I saw you
with your friend Robert,

756
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,666
well, you know.

757
00:41:35,766 --> 00:41:37,733
Do you know
a couple of months ago

758
00:41:37,833 --> 00:41:40,333
Robert came with his
life partner to visit?

759
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:42,666
What a lovely man.
They’re so happy.

760
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:46,000
They’ve been together
10 years now.
Isn’t that wonderful?

761
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,066
Yes, that’s
wonderful for them,

762
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:51,033
but not me
because I love women.

763
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:54,300
Of course you love women.
It’s just a myth
that gay men hate women.

764
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,300
But that’s not
what this is about.

765
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,566
I’ve been doing some
reading, a book called
<i>Loving Someone Gay.</i>

766
00:42:00,666 --> 00:42:03,500
Mom...

767
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,866
I love you so much,

768
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:08,500
and I know you love me
and you mean well,

769
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,000
and you’re so sweet
and supportive.

770
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,300
And if I were gay,
I’d be so lucky

771
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,100
to have someone
like you, but I’m not.

772
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,366
And I don’t know
what else I can say
or do to convince you

773
00:42:21,466 --> 00:42:23,400
that I’m straight.

774
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500
This was just
a huge misunderstanding.

775
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,700
I was just trying
to get back at Barry.

776
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,400
Oh, well, Barry’s
a little uptight.

777
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,233
You know,
he’ll come around.
He’s a good boy.

Thank you.

781
00:42:56,233 --> 00:43:00,300
I’m just going to
throw this out there.
Are you alone?

782
00:43:06,566 --> 00:43:09,066
Yeah.

783
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,066
That sucked.

784
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,333
Hey.

785
00:43:29,933 --> 00:43:31,166
Me?

786
00:43:44,633 --> 00:43:46,300
Hi.

787
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,300
- You got one.

pull this off?

00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:27,133
It’s okay.

791
00:44:27,233 --> 00:44:30,466
It sometimes happens
to older guys.

792
00:44:30,566 --> 00:44:32,566
I need to go.

793
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:34,666
Well... maybe...

794
00:44:34,766 --> 00:44:37,000
maybe you could try
that Viagra stuff.

795
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,800
I really need to go.

796
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,200

and why are you pounding
on my door at 3:00 A.M.?

800
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,900
- I was looking for Kelly.
I thought--
- He’s not here.

801
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,900
You have the right place.
He’s just not here.

802
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,566
Oh.

803
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:16,800
Doesn’t mean he’s out
with another guy.

804
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,133
It’s fine if he is.
That’s not-- We’re not--

[locks clanking]

806
00:45:25,233 --> 00:45:27,733
You’re Todd,
the straight guy.

807
00:45:27,833 --> 00:45:30,366
Uh, yeah.
I guess that would be me.

808
00:45:30,466 --> 00:45:33,933
Oh, hi. I’m Bonnie,
Kelly’s fag-hag.

809
00:45:34,033 --> 00:45:35,866
- Hi.
- Hi.

810
00:45:35,966 --> 00:45:37,833
You wanna come in?

811
00:45:37,933 --> 00:45:39,733
I’d better go.
It’s late.

812
00:45:39,833 --> 00:45:43,500
Well, I’m already up.
You might as well come on in.

813
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,366
But I don’t even
know you.

814
00:45:45,466 --> 00:45:47,600
And you never will
standing out there.

815
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,766
Come on.

816
00:45:50,233 --> 00:45:51,433
Thirsty?

817
00:45:51,533 --> 00:45:53,966
Uh...sure.

818
00:45:54,066 --> 00:45:56,400
So, Todd,

819
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,233
what is this
all about?

820
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:02,333
You can’t tell me you were
just in the neighborhood

821
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:04,000
at 3:00 A.M.

822
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:06,466
Um, I just need
to talk to Kelly.

823
00:46:06,566 --> 00:46:08,300
About?

824
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,866
It’s between us.

825
00:46:09,966 --> 00:46:11,200
[giggles]

826
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,133
Kelly tells me everything.

827
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:15,066
We’ve been best friends
for years now.

828
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:16,700
Hey, is this about
your mother?

829
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,233
You know about
my mother?

830
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:22,100
Just the broad outlines.
Kelly says she’s really sweet.

831
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,400
In a demented
sort of way.

832
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,600
Well, at least
she’s not a bitch.

833
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,066
You should meet mine.

834
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,166
So you and Kelly
live here together?

835
00:46:32,266 --> 00:46:34,766
Mm-hmm. We have
for a couple of years now.

836
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,433
He never mentioned you.

837
00:46:37,533 --> 00:46:40,133
You know, I think
he’s been keeping us apart,

838
00:46:40,233 --> 00:46:42,233
probably afraid that we’re
gonna end up sleeping together,

839
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,100
and then, you know, things
will get a little awkward.

840
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,466
You pretty much say whatever
pops into your head, don’t you?

841
00:46:47,566 --> 00:46:49,933
Pretty much.
Does that bother you?

842
00:46:50,033 --> 00:46:51,766
I’m not sure yet.

843
00:46:53,133 --> 00:46:55,033
You know, Kelly is right.

[giggles]

847
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:04,166
I’m not gay.

848
00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:05,800
Well, nobody said you were.

849
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,100
Everyone says I am,
but I’m not.

850
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,833
Well, makes
no difference to me.

851
00:47:09,933 --> 00:47:11,366
Some of the best sex
I’ve ever had

852
00:47:11,466 --> 00:47:12,433
has been with gay men.

853
00:47:12,533 --> 00:47:14,333
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

854
00:47:14,433 --> 00:47:16,333
How do you think
Kelly and I met?

855
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:18,433
Maybe I’m still asleep

856
00:47:18,533 --> 00:47:21,100
and hallucinating
this whole conversation.

857
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,433
Maybe.

858
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,033
Chamomile?

859
00:47:29,633 --> 00:47:30,933
We’re gonna fuck,
aren’t we?

860
00:47:31,033 --> 00:47:33,566
- Ah!
- Oh, oh, my gosh!

861
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:35,000
I’m so sorry!

862
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,500
Here, let me get
something cold.

863
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,433
Oh, that was bad.

864
00:47:39,533 --> 00:47:41,100
I’m so sorry!

865
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,833
Oh... is that better?

866
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,366
- Yeah.
- Okay.

867
00:47:47,466 --> 00:47:49,266
Because sometimes I say
things to shock people,

868
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,600
and it’s fun, but I need
to learn not to do it

869
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,133
when they’re holding
sharp objects

870
00:47:53,233 --> 00:47:55,133
or scalding liquids.

871
00:47:55,233 --> 00:47:57,500
So you were just
trying to shock me?

872
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,100
No, no, I really do
wanna have sex with you.

873
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,133
It’s just, in retrospect,

874
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:04,166
maybe I could have had
a more subtle way

875
00:48:04,266 --> 00:48:06,700
of signaling
my interest, huh?

876
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,666
Perhaps.

877
00:48:08,766 --> 00:48:09,766
Yeah.

878
00:48:12,433 --> 00:48:15,366
You’re probably not much
in the mood now, huh?

879
00:48:18,466 --> 00:48:21,733
Yeah.
I better go. I...

880
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:23,733
have to get up for work
in three hours.

881
00:48:27,066 --> 00:48:29,433
You want me to leave
Kelly a message?

882
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:32,066
No. I’ll catch him
later.

00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:58,933
What?

887
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:02,866
Did I hear someone
leave?

888
00:49:02,966 --> 00:49:04,466
[giggles]

889
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:07,033
You don’t usually let
your tricks slam the door.

890
00:49:07,133 --> 00:49:09,500
That’s because
it wasn’t one of my tricks.

891
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,733
- It was one of yours.
- What?

892
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:13,000
My tricks don’t leave.

893
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,000
It was Todd.

894
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:17,400
My Todd?

895
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:18,400
Mm-hmm.

896
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:19,800
Why didn’t you
come get me?

897
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,300
Because it is
3:00 in the morning.

898
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,933
And...

899
00:49:24,033 --> 00:49:26,266
well, because
he’s really cute.

900
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,566
Yeah. He is, isn’t he?

901
00:49:30,666 --> 00:49:34,666
And you know he’s
straight, right?

902
00:49:34,766 --> 00:49:37,066
Yes.

903
00:49:37,166 --> 00:49:39,700
Of course.
Totally.

00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,933

Didn’t mean to scare you.

Not that you don’t

everything.

Oh, yeah. I guess
that was inevitable.

00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:23,166
I’m just hurt
that you didn’t think

921
00:50:23,266 --> 00:50:24,666
that I would understand.

but I’m not narrow.

No, it wasn’t that--

00:50:29,133 --> 00:50:30,700
Listen, if you’d like to,
uh, get together sometime--

925
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,833
Diana, hi!

00:50:32,933 --> 00:50:34,500
Todd, if you have a minute,

00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,633
I would love to see you
in my office.

928
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:38,800
Of course.

00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:43,600
By the way,

00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,500
happy birthday.

931
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:50,966
I want you to know

932
00:50:51,066 --> 00:50:55,333
that this company
is behind you 100%.

933
00:50:55,433 --> 00:50:56,666
Thanks. But...

934
00:50:56,766 --> 00:50:59,500
this isn’t even
a milestone birthday.

935
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,200
Oh, anybody
can have a birthday.

936
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:04,166
But a committed
gay relationship?

937
00:51:04,266 --> 00:51:05,766
That’s a political
statement.

938
00:51:05,866 --> 00:51:07,333
That’s worth celebrating.

939
00:51:07,433 --> 00:51:08,900
What?

940
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,266
This company recognizes
domestic partnerships.

941
00:51:11,366 --> 00:51:12,966
I mean, that’s presuming
you and your partner

942
00:51:13,066 --> 00:51:14,433
want to take
that step sometime.

943
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:15,866
This is unbelievable.

944
00:51:15,966 --> 00:51:17,700
Doesn’t anyone around here
have anything better to do

945
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,533
than talk about
my personal life?

946
00:51:19,633 --> 00:51:21,300
This is a family
here, Todd.

947
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,966
That’s the only kind
of company I like to run.

948
00:51:24,066 --> 00:51:26,133
That’s great, but--

949
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:27,533
Todd, we’re excited for you.

950
00:51:27,633 --> 00:51:29,866
I mean, coming out
at this age?

951
00:51:29,966 --> 00:51:31,100
That’s not
an easy thing to do,

952
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,933
especially not in this
political climate.

953
00:51:33,033 --> 00:51:35,133
That’s why it’s so important.

954
00:51:35,233 --> 00:51:37,233
Now, if you need
any help from me,

955
00:51:37,333 --> 00:51:40,233
you just go to my assistant,
and she’ll let me know.

956
00:51:40,333 --> 00:51:41,800
That’s very thoughtful, but--

957
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,533
Anyway, I think we should
get back to work, don’t you?

958
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:46,033
- We all have deadlines.
- Yes, absolutely.

959
00:51:46,133 --> 00:51:47,766
But the-- the thing is,
Diana, I’m not--

960
00:51:47,866 --> 00:51:49,300
I don’t think you understand--

961
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,366
Scott-- Oh, I’m sorry.
I mean Todd.

962
00:51:51,466 --> 00:51:52,700
You can call me Scott.

963
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,566
I am so looking forward
to meeting your partner

964
00:51:54,666 --> 00:51:56,066
at the company picnic
next month.

965
00:51:56,166 --> 00:51:57,166
I hear he’s a stud!

966
00:51:57,266 --> 00:51:58,233
No, he-- he’s--

967
00:51:58,333 --> 00:51:59,700
That’s the thing
I wanna make clear.

968
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,266
- He’s not my partner.
- Oh, uh, Todd.

969
00:52:01,366 --> 00:52:02,733
Would you do me a favor?

970
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:05,133
I would like you to look into
the Nordlinger account.

971
00:52:05,233 --> 00:52:07,933
Just e-mail me an update.
That would be great.

972
00:52:08,033 --> 00:52:09,233
Absolutely.
I will do that.

973
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:10,500
- You have a good day.
- You, too.

974
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,033
The thing is-- he’s not--
I wanna just be--

975
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:15,433
Oh, hi! I’m so glad
I ran into you.

976
00:52:15,533 --> 00:52:16,900
I need your advice.

977
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,200
About what?

978
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,266
I have a few questions
about, you know,

979
00:52:20,366 --> 00:52:21,933
backdoor issues?

980
00:52:22,033 --> 00:52:23,333
We’re on the fifth floor.

981
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:24,900
No, no, no, no, no,
silly.

982
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,400
The back door.

983
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,166
Back door?

984
00:52:28,266 --> 00:52:30,466
Carl and I have been
experimenting,

985
00:52:30,566 --> 00:52:32,466
and it’s really
working out great.

986
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:34,866
At first when he
suggested it, I thought,

987
00:52:34,966 --> 00:52:36,266
"Oh, no, he’s gay!"

988
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:38,266
But that’s not what
it’s all about.

989
00:52:38,366 --> 00:52:40,400
It’s totally perked up
our sex life.

990
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:41,533
Um...

991
00:52:41,633 --> 00:52:44,000
So we’re just using
regular lotion.

992
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:46,066
But I know that there’s
a million products

993
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:47,500
out on the market.

994
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,733
What do you think of
the stuff that heats up?

995
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,166
Is it <i>hot,</i>
or is it just hot?

996
00:52:52,266 --> 00:52:55,533
I’m not gay, and I have
no expertise in this area.

997
00:52:55,633 --> 00:52:57,400
Well, maybe you could
ask your boyfriend

998
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,433
and get back to me.

999
00:52:58,533 --> 00:53:00,333
I kinda want to surprise
Carl this weekend

1000
00:53:00,433 --> 00:53:01,333
with something fun.

1001
00:53:01,433 --> 00:53:03,266
Thanks!
You’re such a doll!

1002
00:53:03,366 --> 00:53:04,466
Okay, bye-bye.

- [knocks]
- It’s only me.

1004
00:53:08,766 --> 00:53:10,433
Sorry I’m late.

1005
00:53:10,533 --> 00:53:12,366
Hi, honey.

1006
00:53:12,466 --> 00:53:13,366
Hi.

1007
00:53:13,466 --> 00:53:14,566
Happy birthday.

1008
00:53:14,666 --> 00:53:16,100
Thanks.

1009
00:53:17,933 --> 00:53:19,466
Darling,
here’s your dinner.

1010
00:53:19,566 --> 00:53:21,700
I invited your brother.
I hope that’s okay.

1011
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,266
That’s actually

for you all.

1013

You know, my doctor says
I shouldn’t have saturated fat.

1014
00:53:27,733 --> 00:53:29,266
But if you all want...

1015
00:53:29,366 --> 00:53:31,033
Mom, Mom, it’s fine.
Everything looks perfect.

1016
00:53:31,133 --> 00:53:32,133
Why don’t you sit down?

1017
00:53:32,233 --> 00:53:33,966
I sure missed
your home cooking.

1018
00:53:34,066 --> 00:53:36,466
Me, too, Mom. I’m sorry
I haven’t been around more.

1019
00:53:36,566 --> 00:53:37,900
Oh, don’t be silly.

1020
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I arrived in town
unexpectedly,

1021
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,566
and you’re starting
a new relationship.

1022
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:47,200
And I may be old, but I remember
how exciting that was.

1023
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,900
Can the three of us talk
as adults?

1024
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,400
Sure, honey.

1025
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:55,166
Well, as long as you
don’t get too... graphic.

1026
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:57,500
Look, um,

1027
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:02,033
I’m sorry if I haven’t been very
open about my personal life.

1028
00:54:02,133 --> 00:54:04,500
I guess I’m a pretty
private person.

1029
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,600
And I can see how you might
misinterpret that

1030
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,500
and think that I had
something to hide.

1031
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,966
It’s okay.
I understand it now.

1032
00:54:12,066 --> 00:54:13,266
Mom, please, let me finish.

1033
00:54:14,933 --> 00:54:17,400
The truth is, I don’t have
any exciting secrets.

1034
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,733
I mean, up until recently,

1035
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:21,266
the most titillating thing
in my life was cable television.

1036
00:54:21,366 --> 00:54:22,900
And I guess that’s why
I fell for it

1037
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,733
when Barry took
an uncharacteristic interest

1038
00:54:24,833 --> 00:54:26,333
and seemed to be trying
to fix me up--

1039
00:54:26,433 --> 00:54:28,300
Hold on. Are you saying
this is my fault?

1040
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:29,466
Are you blaming <i>me?</i>

1041
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:31,833

I’m saying, Barry.

- He’s blaming me.
- Barry.

1045
00:54:35,666 --> 00:54:37,266
He’s a homo,
and he’s blaming me.

1046
00:54:37,366 --> 00:54:39,733
I’m not blaming you, Barry.
Will you shut up?

1047
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,933
Who is it, darling?

1048
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:45,366
It’s the police.

What’s wrong?

1087
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,233
I think, just for right now,

1088
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:37,900
we shouldn’t see
each other for a while.

1089
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,500
Thought you actually
had to date someone

1090
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,966
before he could
break up with you.

1091
00:56:41,066 --> 00:56:43,300
We are not breaking up,
because we were never a couple.

1092
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,900
I think we should just
back off a little bit.

1093
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,266
That’s such
a break-up line.

1094

Oh, my God, you’re right.

00:56:57,633 --> 00:56:58,966
- And then kissed me!
- How old are you?

1101
00:56:59,066 --> 00:57:01,400

He kissed me!

00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:07,666
Okay, so my problems

1106
00:57:07,766 --> 00:57:09,633
don’t amount to a hill of
beans in this crazy world.

1107

Fine. They’re still
my problems,

and my life still feels
totally screwed up!

Okay, what’s the real
issue here, huh?

1110
00:57:14,566 --> 00:57:16,533
You don’t like people thinking
you’re gay when we’re
not doing anything?

1111
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,700
- Exactly!
- Well, that’s easy to fix.

1113
00:57:20,233 --> 00:57:22,033
What? I just think it’s a shame
that the only action going on

1114
00:57:22,133 --> 00:57:23,833
is in the minds
of your friends and family.

1115
00:57:23,933 --> 00:57:25,666
But sleeping together
isn’t gonna solve anything.

1116
00:57:25,766 --> 00:57:26,700
What is that?

1117
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,266
Oh, night firming cream.

1118
00:57:28,366 --> 00:57:29,733
It’s my own special blend.

You want some?

No, I don’t need night
firming cream right now.

1121
00:57:35,166 --> 00:57:36,933
Actually, you do.
Anyway, look.

1122
00:57:37,033 --> 00:57:38,900
You already have
the stigma of being gay.

1123
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,400
You might as well experience
some of the fun.

1124
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,900
But it wouldn’t be fun
because I’m not into guys.

you didn’t enjoy

any of the fooling around you
did when you were 12?

1127

the point.

1128
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,000
At that age, brushing
against a tree is exciting.

1129
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,666
I guarantee I’m more fun
than a tree.

1130
00:57:52,766 --> 00:57:54,600
The answer is still no.

1131
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,566
Um, can you stir this?
And don’t stop.

1132
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:59,600
- Just keep stirring.
- Yes, yes, yes!

1133

you’re not willing

to have a little fun
with me

1135
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,133
is because of what
it might mean about you.

attracted to you.

1184
01:00:25,766 --> 01:00:27,733
Do I set off
your gaydar?

1185
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:29,733
I’m sure
because you’re sure.

1186
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,900
But, I-- I’m not sure!
I mean, I was sure.

1187
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,400
I don’t know anymore!

1188
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,200
Even my own mother thinks
I’m a closet case!

1189
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,933
Well, your mother
has issues.

1190
01:00:38,033 --> 01:00:40,200
Tell me about it.

1191
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,100
I can only think of
one way to settle this.

1192
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,500
Oh, no.
No, no, no.

1193
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,700
You’re not gonna make me
listen to Barbra Streisand,

1194
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,466
are you?

1195
01:00:47,566 --> 01:00:49,500
I can’t believe
you just said that.

1196
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,333
That is
such a stereotype.

1197
01:00:54,866 --> 01:00:56,033
Okay, you know what?

1198
01:00:56,133 --> 01:00:57,166
She’s the world’s
greatest living singer

1199
01:00:57,266 --> 01:00:59,333
and criminally underrated
as a director.

1200
01:00:59,433 --> 01:01:02,000
And <i>Yentl</i> was the only
decent movie musical of the--

1201
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,333
I see your point.

1202
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,633
What were we talking about?

1203
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:12,033
The one sure way to know
whether or not I’m gay.

1204
01:01:12,133 --> 01:01:14,333
Right.

1205
01:01:14,433 --> 01:01:15,966
We have sex.

1206
01:01:16,066 --> 01:01:18,000
And that’s gonna prove
that I’m straight?

1207
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,766
Well, then you’ll know.

1208
01:01:19,866 --> 01:01:21,100
I mean, it’ll either be

1209
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,266
the most incredible
experience of your life

1210
01:01:23,366 --> 01:01:24,300
or it won’t.

1211
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,833
What if you’re
just a bad lay?

1212
01:01:30,166 --> 01:01:31,333
No.

1213
01:01:32,533 --> 01:01:33,933
Okay.

1214
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,733
So... we have sex...

1215
01:01:39,833 --> 01:01:40,833
Mm-hmm.

1216
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,800
And if it doesn’t
send me over the moon,

1217
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,766
then I’m straight?

1218
01:01:47,866 --> 01:01:49,233
Pretty much.

1219
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:53,300
What if I do like it?

1220
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,766
Well, then,
you’ve lucked into

1221
01:01:55,866 --> 01:01:59,833
a pretty amazing boyfriend,
if I do say so myself.

1222
01:01:59,933 --> 01:02:01,566
I-- I don’t think
I’m broad-minded enough

1223
01:02:01,666 --> 01:02:02,700
to go through with this.

1224
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,766
Well, you’ve already
kissed me,

1225
01:02:04,866 --> 01:02:06,166
and you didn’t turn to stone

1226
01:02:06,266 --> 01:02:08,000
or drop dead
from a heart attack.

1227
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:12,366
But it wasn’t much of a kiss,
as you already pointed out.

1228
01:02:12,466 --> 01:02:13,466
All right.

1229
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:17,400
Well...

1230
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:21,933
Let’s start with that.

1231
01:02:24,566 --> 01:02:26,300
What are you
so afraid of?

1232
01:02:29,233 --> 01:02:30,800
Hmm?

1233
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:54,733
There.

1234
01:02:58,866 --> 01:03:00,733
That was a real kiss.

1235
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,566
That wasn’t...

1236
01:03:05,666 --> 01:03:06,733
gross.

1237
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:07,866
[laughs]

1238
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:11,966
High praise, indeed.

1239
01:03:12,066 --> 01:03:15,466
I mean, I thought
I’d wanna throw up...

1240
01:03:15,566 --> 01:03:16,800
but I don’t.

1241
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,933
Okay, stop.
You’re making me blush.

1242
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:21,933
I-- I need a drink.

1243
01:03:22,033 --> 01:03:23,733
Yeah.

1244
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,300
So do I.

1245
01:04:02,066 --> 01:04:03,166
[chuckles]

1246
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,233
I can’t believe
I might actually do this.

1247
01:04:26,166 --> 01:04:27,600
What if it’s a mistake?

1248
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:32,600
Finding out who you are
is never a mistake.

1249
01:04:33,866 --> 01:04:35,733
Do you trust me?

1250
01:04:40,466 --> 01:04:43,000
’Cause I trust you.

1251
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:45,133
I really care about you.

1252
01:04:47,433 --> 01:04:50,533
If we do this,
and I don’t like it,

1253
01:04:50,633 --> 01:04:53,700
you have to promise me

1254
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,666
that you won’t
fall in love with me.

1255
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:57,133
[laughs]

1256
01:04:58,766 --> 01:05:00,633
Listen to you.

1257
01:05:02,866 --> 01:05:05,233
Look, if it’s one thing
gay men are good at,

1258
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:07,233
it’s sex that’s
only about sex.

1259
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,300
That and decorating.

1260
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,700
[laughs]

1261
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,900
Well, your sense
of humor’s coming back.

1262
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:19,466
That’s a good sign.

1263
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,933
Shall we?

1264
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:44,533
[moans]

1265
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,366
Was that a good moan
or a bad moan?

1266
01:05:48,466 --> 01:05:50,000
It was good.
It felt good.

1267
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:57,633
If I do something
you don’t like, you tell me.

1268
01:05:57,733 --> 01:05:59,400
You’re talking
too much.

1269
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,566
Right. Okay.

1270
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,766
Can-- Can we turn
the lights out?

1271
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,600
Yeah. Whatever you want.

1272
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,100
[whispers]
You have chest hair.

1273
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:19,633
[laughs]

1274
01:06:19,733 --> 01:06:21,333
Is that a bad thing?

1275
01:06:21,433 --> 01:06:23,666
It’s definitely different.

1276
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:28,333
[rustling]

1277
01:06:31,066 --> 01:06:32,200
[Todd]
Ow.

1278
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,666
[Kelly]
Sorry.

1279
01:06:33,766 --> 01:06:35,700
You could put an eye
out with that thing.

1280
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:37,233
[laughing]

1281
01:06:37,333 --> 01:06:39,933
How much of that bottle
have you had?

1282
01:06:40,033 --> 01:06:41,700
Enough, I guess.

1283
01:06:48,733 --> 01:06:50,466
Mmm.

1284
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,233
Morning.

1285
01:06:59,533 --> 01:07:01,133
I have to go.

1286
01:07:05,133 --> 01:07:06,733
I knew you’d freak out.

1287
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:08,966
I’m not freaking out.
I just have to...

1288
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:10,200
go to work.

1289
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:11,700
Was I that good?

1290
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,266
Can we not talk
about this?

1291
01:07:13,366 --> 01:07:15,800
Look, if it makes you feel
any better, in Latin America,

1292
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:18,600
guys aren’t considered gay
for having sex with other guys,

1293
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:19,633
if they’re on top.

1294
01:07:19,733 --> 01:07:20,933
Well, that’s a relief.

1295
01:07:21,033 --> 01:07:22,866
So I’m straight as long
as I move to Ecuador.

1296
01:07:22,966 --> 01:07:25,800
Look, you can be straight here
if that’s who you really are.

1297
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:27,466
I’ll call you.

1298
01:07:55,533 --> 01:07:57,033
What are you
doing up so early?

1299
01:07:57,133 --> 01:07:58,833
Oh, I couldn’t sleep.
A lot on my mind.

1300
01:07:58,933 --> 01:08:00,066
Join the club.

1301
01:08:00,166 --> 01:08:02,033
You all right, honey?

1302
01:08:02,133 --> 01:08:04,166
I don’t wanna talk
about it.

1303
01:08:04,266 --> 01:08:05,433
[inhaling]

1304
01:08:05,533 --> 01:08:07,233
I love that scent
that Kelly wears.

1305
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,866
What’s it called?

1306
01:08:08,966 --> 01:08:10,533
What’s the scent
that Kelly wears--

1307
01:08:10,633 --> 01:08:12,300
How the hell should I know?
Eternity.

1308
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,100
Fag Forever.
Something like that.

1309
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,933
You and Kelly had a fight?

1310
01:08:16,033 --> 01:08:18,366
Mom! No!

1311
01:08:18,466 --> 01:08:20,766
Oh, honey, there’s this thing
called couples counseling.

1312
01:08:20,866 --> 01:08:22,266
Your father and I did it.

1313
01:08:22,366 --> 01:08:24,200
Mom, we are not a c--

1314
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,433
You and Dad?

1315
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:27,066
Yeah. It was in the ’70s.

1316
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:28,633
We learned a lot
about communication.

1317
01:08:28,733 --> 01:08:31,166
I really think it would
be good for you and Kelly.

1318
01:08:31,266 --> 01:08:33,500
Mother, listen to me.

1319
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:37,100
I don’t know how many times, in
how many ways, I can say this.

1320
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:39,933
He is not my boyfriend!

1321
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:42,766
Well, whatever he is,
you care a lot about him.

1322
01:08:42,866 --> 01:08:44,200
He’s nothing to me!

1323
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,700
Look, I may not have a genius
IQ, but I’m not a moron.

1324
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,100
Don’t bullshit me!

1325
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,366
I need to get ready
for work, Mother.

1326
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:53,466
You want breakfast?

1327
01:08:53,566 --> 01:08:54,466
[door slams]

1328
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,466
[woman]
Ask him about
the stripper.

1329
01:08:58,566 --> 01:08:59,966
Hey, Todd,
how’s it going?

1330
01:09:01,433 --> 01:09:02,600
Hey.

1331
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:04,500
Did you enjoy the birthday
gift we got you?

1332
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,200
The whole office
chipped in.

1333
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:07,700
Clayton...

1334
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,533
Look, are you and Kelly gonna
be at the Happy Hour tonight?

1335
01:09:10,633 --> 01:09:12,766
There is no me and Kelly, okay?

1336
01:09:12,866 --> 01:09:15,166
And I’m not gonna be
a Happy Hour tonight, or ever.

1337
01:09:15,266 --> 01:09:17,533
I’m not gay!

1338
01:09:17,633 --> 01:09:18,666
Whatever.

1339
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,600
Todd had a little spat
with his boyfriend.

1340
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,933
Oh, so is that why
you weren’t at the meeting?

1341
01:09:26,033 --> 01:09:29,666
There is no boyfriend,
and there was no spat.

1342
01:09:29,766 --> 01:09:31,266
What meeting?

1343
01:09:31,366 --> 01:09:33,733
Project meeting.
Been scheduled for a week.

1344
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:36,066
Oh, my God, I forgot.

1345
01:09:36,166 --> 01:09:38,933
Hey, are you okay?
You don’t look so good.

1346
01:09:39,033 --> 01:09:40,400
I’m fine.

1347
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,466
Some of us girls are going
out for drinks after work.

1348
01:09:42,566 --> 01:09:43,866
Come along.
We’ll cheer you up.

1349
01:09:43,966 --> 01:09:45,933
I appreciate that--

1350
01:09:46,033 --> 01:09:47,366
I won’t take no
for an answer.

1351
01:09:51,233 --> 01:09:52,300
Party.

1352
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:53,866
[woman]
You’re not gonna be there,

1353
01:09:53,966 --> 01:09:55,400
dragging my ass down!

1354
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:56,733
[woman #2]
Finally!

1355
01:09:56,833 --> 01:09:59,033
Did you kick him out?

1356
01:09:59,133 --> 01:10:00,700
Not exactly.

1357
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,100
He has nowhere to go,
okay?

1358
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,966
But I told him he’s gotta be
out by the end of the month.

1359
01:10:06,066 --> 01:10:07,133
Ann, you’re crazy.

1360
01:10:07,233 --> 01:10:09,066
Now you’re never
gonna get rid of him.

1361
01:10:09,166 --> 01:10:10,533
Tell him you’re gay--

1362
01:10:10,633 --> 01:10:12,533
surefire way to get rid
of unwanted houseguests.

1363
01:10:12,633 --> 01:10:15,300
No, that’s not gonna work

1364
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:18,533
because men get all
turned on by lesbians.

1365
01:10:18,633 --> 01:10:20,900
Well, men-- Okay, they think
they want two women.

1366
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,266
Oh, please.
Do the math.

1367
01:10:22,366 --> 01:10:24,333
Five minutes
divided by two?

1368
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:26,333
Not even worth
shaving your legs for.

1369
01:10:26,433 --> 01:10:28,433
[woman #2]
Exactly.

1370
01:10:28,533 --> 01:10:29,900
I just think
it’s really weird

1371
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,033
that men want
to watch that.

1372
01:10:32,133 --> 01:10:33,233
Like, I don’t know.

1373
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:34,600
I just-- I don’t get it.

1374
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,200
I totally get it.

1375
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:40,000
Haven’t you guys ever seen
two men having sex?

1376
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:41,800
[woman #2]
No. Why would I
see that?

1377
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:42,833
It’s hot.

1378
01:10:42,933 --> 01:10:44,866
Okay, you are officially
a freak.

1379
01:10:44,966 --> 01:10:46,866
Girls, come on,
back me up!

1380
01:10:46,966 --> 01:10:48,066
No, I’m sorry.

1381
01:10:48,166 --> 01:10:49,700
I’m with Sarah
on this one.

1382
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,733
I just think it’s
disgustingly, ugh, gross.

1383
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:54,533
I mean, sorry,
no offense.

1384
01:10:54,633 --> 01:10:56,833
None taken.
I feel the same way.

1385
01:10:56,933 --> 01:10:59,033
[woman #3]
What, do you
rent gay porn?

1386
01:10:59,133 --> 01:11:00,900
No, no, no, I--I--

1387
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,033
I’m just saying that
with the right two guys,

1388
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:04,666
it’s really sexy.

1389
01:11:04,766 --> 01:11:06,666
I would just settle
for one man

1390
01:11:06,766 --> 01:11:08,000
if he knew what
he was doing.

1391
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,000
Thank you.

1392
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,266
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen.

1393
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:13,166
[Ann]
Angelo, he couldn’t even
find my g-spot

1394
01:11:13,266 --> 01:11:15,600
if he had a flashlight
and a map.

1395
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:18,966
I’ve completely given up
on having orgasms during sex.

1396
01:11:19,066 --> 01:11:21,200
If my shower massage
had a dental plan,

1397
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,700
I’d fucking marry it!

1398
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,466
[laughing]

1399
01:11:24,566 --> 01:11:26,700
I didn’t realize...

1400
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,233
I just didn’t realize
girls talked like this.

1401
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:30,500
[woman #2]
Like what?

1402
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,466
What are we supposed
to talk about?

1403
01:11:32,566 --> 01:11:33,733
You know...

1404
01:11:33,833 --> 01:11:34,766
- Love...
- Love...

1405
01:11:34,866 --> 01:11:36,133
- relationships.
- relationships.

1406
01:11:36,233 --> 01:11:37,266
Oh, such a pretty
story.

1407
01:11:37,366 --> 01:11:38,800
We talk about
that shit, too.

1408
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:41,400
Yeah. Todd’s having trouble
with his boyfriend.

1409
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:44,333
Oh. Is that fucking asshole
cheating on you?

1410
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:45,600
Kelly’s not like that.

1411
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:47,800
And he’s not my boyfriend,
you know?

1412
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,633
Last night was the first time
I’ve ever had sex with a man.

1413
01:11:53,733 --> 01:11:55,933
[woman #3]
Oh...hey.

1414
01:11:56,033 --> 01:11:57,666
Oh!

1415
01:11:57,766 --> 01:11:58,833
Oh, my God.

1416
01:12:03,733 --> 01:12:06,800
It’s okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1417
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,433
I’ll see you guys
bright and early

1418
01:12:12,533 --> 01:12:13,600
tomorrow morning.

1419
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:15,433
I’m not going to work
tomorrow.

1420
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:20,333
Uh... I don’t think you
should be alone right now.

1421
01:12:20,433 --> 01:12:21,733
Come with me.

1422
01:12:27,233 --> 01:12:29,033
[Melissa laughing]

1423
01:12:29,133 --> 01:12:31,100
This is amazing.

1424
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,300
You didn’t know it could
be like this with a woman, huh?

1425
01:12:37,033 --> 01:12:40,300
I never expected this
to happen between us.

1426
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,866
I never realized
you were interested in me.

1427
01:12:42,966 --> 01:12:46,233
Well, I never knew
the <i>real</i> you.

1428
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:48,933
What do you-- What do you
mean, the real me?

1429
01:12:49,033 --> 01:12:50,233
Oh!

1430
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:53,666
Well, I thought you were just
another boring straight guy.

1431
01:12:56,666 --> 01:12:58,433
You mean you weren’t
interested in me

1432
01:12:58,533 --> 01:12:59,966
because you thought
I was straight?

1433
01:13:00,066 --> 01:13:03,233
Well, I never realized
how complex you were.

1434
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,166
So because I slept with a man,
suddenly I’m complex?

1435
01:13:12,266 --> 01:13:13,366
Well, yeah!

1436
01:13:18,733 --> 01:13:21,100
Wait a minute.

1437
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:23,833
You’re not interested
in me at all, are you?

1438
01:13:23,933 --> 01:13:25,700
I’m just a challenge.

1439
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:27,700
Of course
I’m interested in you.

1440
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,166
No. No.

1441
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:38,566
We wouldn’t even be here
if you didn’t think I was gay.

1442
01:13:38,666 --> 01:13:40,966
Look, do you wanna
fuck or not?

1443
01:13:41,066 --> 01:13:44,033
Of course I do,
because I’m a straight man

1444
01:13:44,133 --> 01:13:47,333
and I’ve been lusting after you
from the first time I saw you.

1445
01:13:54,466 --> 01:13:56,766
I think you better go.

1446
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:00,633
But--

1447
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,666
[beep]

1448
01:14:16,766 --> 01:14:19,000
<i>Uh, hi. It’s Kelly.</i>

1449
01:14:19,100 --> 01:14:21,000
<i>You didn’t pick up at work,</i>

1450
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:23,800
<i>so I thought
I’d try you here.</i>

1451
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:27,200
<i>Just thought
I’d make sure you’re okay.</i>

1452
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,933
<i>Call me.</i>

1453
01:14:33,133 --> 01:14:34,666
Maybe you should call.

1454
01:14:34,766 --> 01:14:37,766
Maybe you should just
mind your own damn business!

1455
01:14:37,866 --> 01:14:40,766
I did not bring you up
to speak to me like that.

1456
01:14:40,866 --> 01:14:43,133
I’m sorry. I’m just
a little on edge right now.

1457
01:14:43,233 --> 01:14:45,466
Well, honey, you hungry?
Let me make you some chicken.

1458
01:14:45,566 --> 01:14:47,433
- Mom, I’m not hungry.
- Chicken parmesan?

1459
01:14:47,533 --> 01:14:49,366
[knocking]
Hello!

1460
01:14:49,466 --> 01:14:50,433
Oh, Mom.

1461
01:14:50,533 --> 01:14:51,800
I’m so glad you’re still here,

1462
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:53,700
because I have to say something
to the both of you.

1463
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:55,700
I should say so.

1464
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:57,833
We’ve both been waiting
for your apology.

1465
01:14:57,933 --> 01:15:00,400
Mom...

1466
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,800
I’m gay!

1467
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,333
Yeah, I finally realized
I’m gay, just like him.

1468
01:15:06,433 --> 01:15:08,800
That’s why this whole thing
has been bothering me so much.

1469
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:10,300
[chuckling]

1470
01:15:15,433 --> 01:15:17,466
You just can’t stand

1471
01:15:17,566 --> 01:15:19,533
to let your brother be
the center of attention,

1472
01:15:19,633 --> 01:15:20,533
can you?

1473
01:15:20,633 --> 01:15:22,700
I remember
on his tenth birthday,

1474
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,833
you deliberately
crashed your bike

1475
01:15:24,933 --> 01:15:27,600
so that we would have to get
you to the emergency room,

1476
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:29,333
and Todd’s party
was ruined!

1477
01:15:29,433 --> 01:15:32,666
My bicycle?
No, no, that was an accident.

1478
01:15:32,766 --> 01:15:35,500
Darling, I am so sorry

1479
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,266
if I’ve neglected you.

1480
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:41,066
But your brother
needs me right now.

1481
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:43,766
[shouting]
Ma, did you hear
what I said?

1482
01:15:43,866 --> 01:15:44,866
I’m gay!

1483
01:15:44,966 --> 01:15:46,233
You are not gay!

1484
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,400
Yes, I am!
I’m gay!

1485
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,233
But I’ve been suppressing it
all these years,

1486
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:52,400
mindlessly, aimlessly fucking as
many different women as I can,

1487
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,566
hoping that it would
somehow change me.

1488
01:15:54,666 --> 01:15:56,333
But it’s no use.

1489
01:15:56,433 --> 01:15:58,666
I am what I am.

1490
01:15:58,766 --> 01:16:00,866
How dare you say the F-word
in front of your mother!

1491
01:16:00,966 --> 01:16:03,666
Are you listening to me?
I had an epiphany!

1492
01:16:03,766 --> 01:16:06,733
And I don’t have to fight it
anymore because I’m gay!

1493
01:16:06,833 --> 01:16:08,433
I’m gay, I’m gay,
just like my brother Todd.

1494
01:16:08,533 --> 01:16:10,100
I’m not gay.

1495
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:11,966
Oh, yes, you are.

1496
01:16:12,066 --> 01:16:14,066
You are gay,
my little brother,

1497
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:15,733
and you’re very,
very good at it.

1498
01:16:15,833 --> 01:16:17,233
- You’re gay, and I’m gay.
- I am not gay!

1499
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:18,433
Why can’t we just be
gay together?

1500
01:16:18,533 --> 01:16:20,500
There’ll be no together
with the gay!

1501
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,633
Shut up, both of you!

1502
01:16:22,733 --> 01:16:25,866
You’re my boys.
I know my boys.

1503
01:16:25,966 --> 01:16:29,933
Barry, you are not gay,
and that’s that.

1504
01:16:30,033 --> 01:16:31,433
But, Ma, no fair!

1505
01:16:31,533 --> 01:16:33,866
I am gonna go lie down.

1506
01:16:33,966 --> 01:16:37,800
You boys are putting me
into an early grave.

1507
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:40,333
But how come he gets to be...

1508
01:16:40,433 --> 01:16:42,266
all gay all the time?

1509
01:16:42,366 --> 01:16:43,333
[door slams]

1510
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,233
You believe me?

1511
01:16:48,366 --> 01:16:49,433
Yes.

1512
01:16:49,533 --> 01:16:53,333
Okay! We got one sane
person in this whole family.

1513
01:16:53,433 --> 01:16:57,133
So, what do you say you,
uh, hook a brother up

1514
01:16:57,233 --> 01:16:58,933
with any of your
hot gay friends?

1515
01:16:59,033 --> 01:17:03,033
Okay, I support you,
I accept you unconditionally.

1516
01:17:03,133 --> 01:17:05,433
I’ll even march with you
in Gay Pride.

1517
01:17:05,533 --> 01:17:09,233
But, Barry, please,
don’t ask me to pimp for you.

1518
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:10,900
All right.

1519
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,533
Fine. Just trying
to get a little love.

1520
01:17:13,633 --> 01:17:15,833
Jesus, is that so wrong?

1521
01:17:15,933 --> 01:17:17,400
What do you got to eat?

1522
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:18,700
You exhaust me.

Todd?

Are you all right?

1533
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:24,333
What?

1534
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:26,866
You look terrible.
What’s going on?

1535
01:18:28,766 --> 01:18:30,866
I’m fine.
Everything’s fine. I--

1536
01:18:32,133 --> 01:18:33,900
- Look, just come with me.
- Why?

1537
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,100
Just get up, walk this way.

Right over here, honey.

1546
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:53,633
There you go.

1547
01:18:56,466 --> 01:18:58,066
And tell me everything.

1548
01:19:05,966 --> 01:19:07,233
Go on.
I’m unshockable.

I...

1550
01:19:08,366 --> 01:19:10,466
I...

1551
01:19:10,566 --> 01:19:12,666
had sex with a man.

1552
01:19:12,766 --> 01:19:14,733
You cheated on Kelly?

1553
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,700
No. It was with Kelly.

1554
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,400
I mean, I had sex
with Kelly.

1555
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,733
I mean, my first time
ever with a man.

1556
01:19:20,833 --> 01:19:23,333
And it didn’t work out.
Oh, honey.

1557
01:19:23,433 --> 01:19:25,533
Sometimes the first time
is painful.

1558
01:19:25,633 --> 01:19:27,666
- You have to learn to relax.
- It’s not that.

1559
01:19:27,766 --> 01:19:29,866
It’s just...

1560
01:19:29,966 --> 01:19:32,133
I’m not gay.

1561
01:19:32,233 --> 01:19:34,200
I’m just... not.

1562
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:38,466
Oh. Seems like you have
the whole thing figured out.

1563
01:19:38,566 --> 01:19:40,266
Why so miserable?

1564
01:19:40,366 --> 01:19:42,433
I don’t know.

1565
01:19:42,533 --> 01:19:44,733
I can’t eat.
I can’t concentrate.

1566
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:46,800
My whole life
just feels off.

1567
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,366
I’m no shrink,

1568
01:19:48,466 --> 01:19:51,566
but it sounds like you have
some unresolved issues.

1569
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:53,566
I know you think I’m gay.

1570
01:19:53,666 --> 01:19:55,266
So does my mother,
my brother,

1571
01:19:55,366 --> 01:19:58,033
pretty much
everyone I know.

1572
01:19:58,133 --> 01:20:00,100
Look, in my experience,

1573
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:03,600
sexual identity
is not decided by the masses.

1574
01:20:05,933 --> 01:20:07,100
Right.

1575
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:10,300
So I’m still straight,
no matter what people think.

1576
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:13,366
Well, there’s still
this matter of sex with Kelly.

1577
01:20:13,466 --> 01:20:16,033
It was an experiment

1578
01:20:16,133 --> 01:20:18,033
to prove I was straight.

1579
01:20:19,366 --> 01:20:21,533
Did it work?

1580
01:20:21,633 --> 01:20:23,266
Yes.

1581
01:20:23,366 --> 01:20:26,066
I mean, I don’t feel
any different.

1582
01:20:26,166 --> 01:20:28,133
I’m still attracted to women,

1583
01:20:28,233 --> 01:20:30,266
and I’m still not
attracted to men.

1584
01:20:30,366 --> 01:20:31,933
But you were able
to have sex with one.

1585
01:20:34,266 --> 01:20:35,200
Yes.

1586
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:37,200
After a few drinks.

1587
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:39,600
Yes.

1588
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:41,366
Do you know what that makes you?

1589
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,100
What?

1590
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,500
Normal.

1591
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,766
How do you figure?

1592
01:20:47,866 --> 01:20:49,266
My grandmother
always had a saying.

1593
01:20:49,366 --> 01:20:53,000
"A stiff prick
has no conscience."

1594
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:54,933
Your grandmother?

1595
01:20:55,033 --> 01:20:57,666
Yeah, we’re all able to get off
in a variety of ways.

1596
01:20:57,766 --> 01:21:01,333
And our sexuality,
our deepest feelings

1597
01:21:01,433 --> 01:21:03,666
about another human being--

1598
01:21:03,766 --> 01:21:06,166
that’s in our hearts
and our minds...

1599
01:21:06,266 --> 01:21:08,966
not our jolly Rogers.

1600
01:21:09,066 --> 01:21:10,900
Let’s say I buy that.

1601
01:21:12,433 --> 01:21:15,066
Why do I still feel
so lousy?

1602
01:21:15,166 --> 01:21:18,600
Oh, can’t eat, can’t sleep.
Sounds like love to me.

1603
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:21,933
I thought that we just
established that I’m not gay.

1604
01:21:22,033 --> 01:21:23,933
There are
all kinds of love.

1605
01:21:24,033 --> 01:21:26,900
Not all of them
have to do with sex.

1606
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,500
Now, look.

1607
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:32,200
I don’t think we’re gonna feel
better until we talk to him.

1608
01:21:35,033 --> 01:21:37,366
I mean, you talk to him.

1609
01:21:51,366 --> 01:21:52,733
Hi.

1610
01:21:53,866 --> 01:21:56,000
Ow! What was that for?

1611
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:57,000
For not calling.

1612
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:58,366
We just had tea.

1613
01:21:58,466 --> 01:22:00,833
Not me, you idiot.
Kelly.

1614
01:22:00,933 --> 01:22:03,966
Oh, well, that’s what
I came to explain.

1615
01:22:05,766 --> 01:22:07,700
He’s not home yet.

1616
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,366
Is he furious with me?

1617
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:11,100
What do you think?

1618
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,266
He didn’t keep
his promise, did he?

1619
01:22:13,366 --> 01:22:15,066
What promise?

1620
01:22:15,166 --> 01:22:16,566
Not to fall in love.

1621
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:17,800
Oh, you know what?

1622
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:20,066
Don’t flatter yourself,
Casanova.

1623
01:22:20,166 --> 01:22:21,666
He just doesn’t
appreciate being used.

1624
01:22:21,766 --> 01:22:23,300
It wasn’t like that.

1625
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:26,700
Oh, really?
Well, what was it like?

1626
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:27,766
Hi.

1627
01:22:27,866 --> 01:22:28,933
Hi.

1628
01:22:31,266 --> 01:22:32,566
Hi.

1629
01:22:32,666 --> 01:22:34,900
Well, this is a surprise.

1630
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,800
I didn’t figure
I’d ever see you again.

1631
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,133
I’m sorry for not calling.

1632
01:22:39,233 --> 01:22:42,466
I... just needed some time
to sort things out.

1633
01:22:42,566 --> 01:22:44,266
Hmm.

1634
01:22:44,366 --> 01:22:45,633
So what’s the verdict?

1635
01:22:45,733 --> 01:22:46,900
Did I rock your world,

1636
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,800
or did you have to close your
eyes and think of England?

1637
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,400
Could we talk inside?

1638
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:58,800
Alone?

1639
01:23:02,666 --> 01:23:04,533
I’ll gong you
if I need you.

1640
01:23:04,633 --> 01:23:06,133
I’ll be out here
hoeing.

1641
01:23:06,233 --> 01:23:07,533
[laughs]
Okay.

1642
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,100
Well?

1643
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:32,166
Well, on a purely
technical level,

1644
01:23:32,266 --> 01:23:33,766
you get high marks.

1645
01:23:38,533 --> 01:23:40,233
But...

1646
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:43,100
I can’t explain it.

1647
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:46,400
And I don’t want
to hurt your feelings.

1648
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:49,833
It’s just...
on some level

1649
01:23:49,933 --> 01:23:51,966
I didn’t feel...

1650
01:23:52,066 --> 01:23:53,633
engaged.

1651
01:23:53,733 --> 01:23:56,000
That’s because
you’re straight.

1652
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,000
Really?
You think so?

1653
01:24:04,433 --> 01:24:05,333
Absolutely.

1654
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:16,966
So... have I totally
screwed up our friendship?

1655
01:24:22,366 --> 01:24:26,400
Well, the bitchy queen in me
wants to punish you.

1656
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,433
But...

1657
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:34,666
But I missed you.

1658
01:24:38,666 --> 01:24:40,400
Yeah.

1659
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,866
Me, too.

1660
01:24:55,366 --> 01:24:56,700
So where does that
leave us?

1661
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:58,833
I mean,
how can we be friends

1662
01:24:58,933 --> 01:25:01,000
if we can’t even look
each other in the eye?

1663
01:25:04,266 --> 01:25:06,733
Truthfully,
this is hard for me.

1664
01:25:06,833 --> 01:25:10,533
I-- You’ve seen a side of me
nobody else has ever seen.

1665
01:25:10,633 --> 01:25:13,233
And part of you wants
to forget that side exists

1666
01:25:13,333 --> 01:25:15,266
and forget me, too.

1667
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,533
Yes.

1668
01:25:20,166 --> 01:25:22,000
Is that really
what you want?

1669
01:25:24,233 --> 01:25:26,066
I don’t know.

1670
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:31,266
Well, then,
so why did you come here?

1671
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:35,766
I couldn’t leave things
like they were.

1672
01:25:35,866 --> 01:25:37,066
I had to explain.

1673
01:25:37,166 --> 01:25:39,500
I had to...
make sure you were okay.

1674
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,433
I’m fine.

1675
01:25:41,533 --> 01:25:43,933
But I’d be lying
if I said

1676
01:25:44,033 --> 01:25:46,000
there wasn’t a part of me
hoping that you’d discover

1677
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:48,433
your inner faggot,
and we’d...

1678
01:25:48,533 --> 01:25:51,033
live happily ever after.

1679
01:25:51,133 --> 01:25:53,366
But I-- I knew that
wasn’t gonna happen.

1680
01:25:57,566 --> 01:25:59,033
Really, I did.

1681
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:08,500
You know,
maybe you should go.

1682
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,500
I’m so sorry.

1683
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,033
I screwed everything up.

1684
01:26:17,133 --> 01:26:18,266
No, no.

1685
01:26:18,366 --> 01:26:20,700
I think on this one,
you had some help.

1686
01:26:34,066 --> 01:26:36,066
Should I call you...

1687
01:26:36,166 --> 01:26:37,700
I-- Look, I don’t know.
Just--

1688
01:26:39,733 --> 01:26:40,966
Just go.

1690

[Mrs. Muller]
Okay, hurry, hurry.

1691
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:38,633
Help!

1692
01:27:38,733 --> 01:27:41,766
I gotcha.
Come on.

1693
01:27:41,866 --> 01:27:43,766
Yeah, get those--
get those bags.

Good afternoon.

1695
01:27:45,433 --> 01:27:47,466
You don’t want to let her
miss this flight.

1696
01:27:47,566 --> 01:27:50,566
She misses the flight,
she stays another night.

1697
01:27:50,666 --> 01:27:51,566
I love ya, Ma!

1698
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:53,033
- Me, too.
- Watch the spikes.

1699

Oh, okay. Love you!

1700
01:27:54,366 --> 01:27:56,266
Okay, Todd, now,
now, it’s not that heavy.

1701
01:27:56,366 --> 01:27:57,666
It’s just a few dresses.

1702
01:27:57,766 --> 01:27:58,833

01:28:00,266 --> 01:28:01,333
Nice to meet you.

1705
01:28:01,433 --> 01:28:03,100
- It was good to see you.
- I love you.

1706
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,233
And maybe next time I come,
maybe there’s grandkids.

1707
01:28:05,333 --> 01:28:06,966
- What?
- Well, I mean, no rush.

1708
01:28:07,066 --> 01:28:09,233
You and Kelly
take your time, of course.

1709
01:28:09,333 --> 01:28:11,966
Mom, do I need to give you
a birds and bees talk now?

1710
01:28:12,066 --> 01:28:13,366
Don’t play dumb with me.

1711
01:28:13,466 --> 01:28:15,400
Look, there’s adoption,
surrogacy, the gay-by boom.

1712
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:16,666
I know all about that.

1713
01:28:16,766 --> 01:28:18,800
Mom, you know Kelly and I
are not a couple.

1714
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:20,800
What, this whole visit
you’re trying to tell me

1715
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:23,133
there’s nothing going on
between you and Kelly?

1716
01:28:23,233 --> 01:28:24,700
I don’t think so!

1717
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,366
I’m just waiting for you
to stand up

1718
01:28:27,466 --> 01:28:30,133
and say, "I’m gay,
and I’m proud of it."

1719
01:28:30,233 --> 01:28:31,566
I’m gay.
I’m proud of it.

1720
01:28:31,666 --> 01:28:33,166
Todd’s just confused.

1721
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:35,400
Honey, let it go.
You are not gay.

1722
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:36,900
Oh, I am gay,
I am <i>so</i> gay,

1723
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,433
I even got
my nipples pierced.

1724
01:28:38,533 --> 01:28:39,866
Look, let me
show you, look--

1725
01:28:39,966 --> 01:28:41,966
- No, not here!
- See, it’s got a tight
little clamp.

1726
01:28:42,066 --> 01:28:44,133
You do not have to be gay.
It’s not a competition.

1727
01:28:44,233 --> 01:28:46,800
I love you as much
as I love your brother.

1728
01:28:46,900 --> 01:28:48,366
Mom, you should go.
I love you.

1729
01:28:48,466 --> 01:28:49,566
Okay.

1730
01:28:49,666 --> 01:28:50,800
Bye, honey.

1731
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:52,033
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

1732
01:28:52,133 --> 01:28:53,366
- Safe trip.
- Let’s go.

1733
01:28:53,466 --> 01:28:56,566
I’d love the kids’ names
to be Rosie and Henry.

1734
01:28:56,666 --> 01:28:57,633
Okay.

1735
01:28:58,966 --> 01:28:59,900
Happy Hour?

1736
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:15,933
I wasn’t sure
you’d come.

1737
01:29:16,033 --> 01:29:17,000
[laughs]

1738
01:29:20,033 --> 01:29:22,066
Yeah, neither was I.

1739
01:29:22,166 --> 01:29:24,233
I’m glad you did.

1740
01:29:24,333 --> 01:29:25,700
I ordered your favorite.

1741
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:26,700
Thank you.

1742
01:29:35,233 --> 01:29:37,900
My mom thinks
we should adopt a kid.

1743
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,366
[laughs, coughs]

1744
01:29:39,466 --> 01:29:41,466
Oh...

1745
01:29:41,566 --> 01:29:44,100
Well, I’ve always
wanted children.

1746
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:46,566
You’d be a great dad.

1747
01:29:46,666 --> 01:29:48,200
Thanks.

1748
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,133
You, too.

1749
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,200
So is this okay
with you?

1750
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:58,000
It’s a little sweet.

1751
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:00,366
Not the lattes, fool.
The two of us.

1752
01:30:00,466 --> 01:30:02,566
It’s not gonna be
too weird between us?

1753
01:30:02,666 --> 01:30:05,333
Weird, yes.
Too weird?

1754
01:30:05,433 --> 01:30:07,866
My boundaries on that
have been expanding.

1755
01:30:07,966 --> 01:30:09,666
What about you?

1756
01:30:11,333 --> 01:30:13,266
I’m okay... now.

1757
01:30:13,366 --> 01:30:17,200
I guess I let my feelings
get a little out of control.

1758
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:20,300
Feelings have a way
of doing that.

1759
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,333
But I’m over it.

1760
01:30:22,433 --> 01:30:26,400
You won’t have to deal with
any more hysterical crying jags.

1761
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,133
I wasn’t worried.

1762
01:30:28,233 --> 01:30:30,800
Well, I was...
for a while.

1763
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,366
I’m not going to be doing
any of that

1764
01:30:32,466 --> 01:30:34,700
"Scarlett pining
for Ashley" crap.

1765
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,300
In fact, I already have
a new personal ad

1766
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:37,600
posted on the Internet.

1767
01:30:37,700 --> 01:30:38,833
You should check it out.

1768
01:30:38,933 --> 01:30:41,200
And this time,
I posted a picture.

1769
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:43,433
Smart move.

1770
01:30:43,533 --> 01:30:45,366
You should do it, too.

1771
01:30:45,466 --> 01:30:49,533
No, I’ve already met
someone I’m interested in.

1772
01:30:49,633 --> 01:30:51,566
Oh, really?

1773
01:30:51,666 --> 01:30:53,533
Someone at work?

1774
01:30:53,633 --> 01:30:57,800
No. Someone
at your apartment.

1775
01:30:59,233 --> 01:31:00,800
Oh, my God.

1776
01:31:00,900 --> 01:31:02,366
How weird.

1777
01:31:02,466 --> 01:31:04,466
- You’re right, forget it.
- No, no.

1778
01:31:04,566 --> 01:31:06,733
It’s not that.
It’s...

1779
01:31:08,633 --> 01:31:09,733
I was gonna ask Barry out.

1780
01:31:09,833 --> 01:31:11,833
My brother?

1781
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:13,666
Well, he is cute.

1782
01:31:13,766 --> 01:31:16,033
And I already know
he comes from a good family.

1783
01:31:16,133 --> 01:31:18,400
We can double-date.

1784
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,866
It would be a hoot.

1785
01:31:20,966 --> 01:31:23,133
You think my coworkers
are confused now?

1786
01:31:23,233 --> 01:31:26,133
Are you still trying to convince
them that you’re straight?

1787
01:31:26,233 --> 01:31:27,766
No, I gave up.

1788
01:31:27,866 --> 01:31:29,900
I mean, really, who cares?

1789
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,133
Besides, technically,
I’m bisexual, right?

1790
01:31:33,233 --> 01:31:35,400
Uh, no.
You’re straight.

1791
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:38,033
If you were bisexual, you never
would have resisted my charms.

1792
01:31:38,133 --> 01:31:40,300
Listen to you.

1793
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,733
Hey, I’m a hot package.

1794
01:31:41,833 --> 01:31:43,200
You’d have been lucky
to have me.

1795
01:31:44,933 --> 01:31:46,633
I know.

1796
01:31:48,933 --> 01:31:51,066
