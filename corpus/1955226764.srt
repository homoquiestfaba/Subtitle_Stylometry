00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:46,111
<i>Mars is
just a tiny dot in the sky.</i>

2
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:49,615
<i>Forty million miles away.</i>

3
00:00:55,588 --> 00:00:56,722
<i>Nothing lives there.</i>

4
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,191
<i>Nothing has ever died there,</i>

5
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,064
<i>but I'm going
to bring it to life.</i>

6
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,103
<i>Fourteen hours and counting.</i>

7
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,573
Captain.

8
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:19,211
Good luck, sir.

9
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:34,193
Skinny.
Hey, excited?

10
00:01:34,195 --> 00:01:36,695
Of course, you?
You bet your ass I am.

11
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,225
<i>Perform a.P.U. Start.</i>

12
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:11,163
<i>Six billion people on earth</i>

13
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:14,233
<i>cheering me on, but most of
them wondering why I'd do this.</i>

14
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:26,245
<i>Commencing launch sequence.
O.S.M. Permit to close.</i>

15
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:26,245
<i>O.S.M closed.</i>

16
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:30,816
<i>Why leave this life behind to
die on some barren planet?</i>

17
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:34,853
<i>- Vent one heater exit.
- Exit. S.S.C.</i>

18
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:38,423
<i>Because I know it
won't be barren for long.</i>

19
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,325
<i>- G.L.S. On.
- G.L.S. Is on.</i>

20
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,161
<i>Final poll.
Houston flight?</i>

21
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:42,161
<i>Houston flight is go.</i>

22
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:45,230
<i>- Fido?
- Fido is go.</i>

23
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,332

<i>- SPE?

<i>CDR?</i>
Commander is go.

27
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,874
<i>We are go for launch.</i>

28
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:59,645
<i>T-minus ten, nine, eight...</i>

29
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:02,181
<i>This is a one-way mission, but
I'm not going there to die.</i>

30
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:05,951
<i>I'm going to Mars to live.</i>

31
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,946
This is captain William d. Stanaforth
here aboard the good ship <i>Zephyr.</i>

32
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,649
We are go for Mars.

33
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:20,018
<i>Roger that, captain.</i>

34
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,654
- Gravitational spin is on.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

35
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:28,093
Requesting permission to kick off
my shoes for the rest of the ride.

36
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:29,961
<i>Roger, captain,
you have permission.</i>

37
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,872
<i>Lights, on.</i>

38
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,679
<i>Welcome to space, captain.</i>

39
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:48,848
<i>You hear that?</i>

40
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,718
<i>That's the crowd out in the
parking lot here in Houston.</i>

41
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,020
<i>We're all thrilled.</i>

42
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:58,924
<i>That said, we'd like to start</i>

43
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:02,594
<i>running diagnostics on some of the
life support systems we can't monitor.</i>

44
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,731
<i>Copy that Stanaforth?</i>

45
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:05,731
Yeah.

46
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:10,969
<i>Starting with the essentials, let's
run a test of the air circulation</i>

47
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,138
<i>and the water reactor.</i>

48
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,740
Yeah, give me a minute, skinny.

49
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,447
Hello, little guys.

50
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,028
<i>How life on
earth started is a mystery,</i>

51
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:50,235
<i>but sustaining it
is an engineering problem.</i>

52
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,508
<i>One meter of steel and insulation
separate me from nothingness.</i>

53
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:04,649
<i>I can feel the pull
of the ship's rotation.</i>

54
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:08,520
<i>My feet are heavy,
my head is light.</i>

55
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:11,923
<i>This massive machine,
so tiny in the void of space,</i>

56
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,026
<i>powerful but fragile.</i>

57
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,864
<i>It's unnerving, but I love it.</i>

58
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:30,902
<i>Hello, captain? It's time for your
first weekly student interface.</i>

59
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,704
<i>Are you ready for the uplink?</i>

60
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:35,140
Kind of busy here.

61
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:39,177
<i>Stanaforth, take a break.
P.R. Is important, too.</i>

62
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,680
<i>Plus a little human interaction
could do you good.</i>

63
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,290
<i>Good morning captain
Stanaforth, I'm Mrs. Wilson,</i>

64
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,659
<i>and I'm going to be monitoring
the student q and a</i>

65
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,795
<i>for the American youth
in science program.</i>

66
00:09:56,797 --> 00:10:00,365
<i>Our first question comes
from Samantha Hopps.</i>

67
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:02,901
<i>Hi, my question is,
if you make it to Mars,</i>

68
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:06,171
<i>how will you be able
to survive the harsh climate?</i>

69
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:11,710
When I get to Mars, we've already sent
up a lot of materials, fuel, food.

70
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:15,747
But one of the big challenges was water.
They just can't send up enough.

71
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,650
That's why I had been
working on this reactor.

72
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,252
<i>Wow, you
made that? What does it do?</i>

73
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:25,924
It's very similar to the
fuel cells on the ship.

74
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:29,928
Like an electric car,
the product is power,

75
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,730
and the byproduct
is drinking water.

76
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,834
Only mine runs on dirt.

77
00:10:36,104 --> 00:10:37,003
<i>Dirt?</i>

78
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:42,641
I invented a process to extract the
hydrogen and the oxygen from the soil,

79
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,143
and recombine them,
which makes h20.

80
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,712
No one thought it would work,

81
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,915
so I went out to
the Atacama desert

82
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:55,286
alone, with no water,
and only one way to survive.

83
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:57,989
To make that reactor work.

84
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:09,167
<i>Day one, I'm making little adjustments.
My throat is parched.</i>

85
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:14,105
Day two, I'm still working, but without
water I'm getting light-headed.

86
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,909
I could have
radioed in for a rescue,

87
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,346
but I thought I could fix it.

88
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,851
<i>By day three, I'm
doing a full reset.</i>

89
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,867
And in that instant, I knew
that this could work on Mars.

90
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:24,909
With this step, I leave the earth
moving to a barren new planet.

91
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,279
Hmm.

92
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,418
With this step,
I leave the earth

93
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,224
moving to a pristine new planet.

94
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,465
I'm leaving earth forever,
but I will not be alone.

95
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:54,272
<i>I am leaving earth
but bringing humanity with me.</i>

96
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:57,008
<i>Bringing you with me.</i>

97
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,246
Mankind has transcended.

98
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:09,287
Mankind has achieved
new heights... come on.

99
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,958
I have come to another planet
seeking a new start, a fresh start,

100
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,094
a new start.

101
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:18,196
Take me to your leader.

102
00:13:53,500 --> 00:14:00,038
<i>Houston to</i> Zephyr. <i>It's 0800 hours.
Time to go to work.</i>

103
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,574
What's the weather like at
Mars base camp right now?

104
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:08,613
<i>You've got a high of about minus 10
degrees with some ice clouds moving in,</i>

105
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:12,116
<i>and then it's going to drop
down to about minus 80 tonight.</i>

106
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,185
Ice clouds?
<i>Yeah.</i>

107
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:14,185
And in Houston?

108
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:17,422
<i>Hot and humid.
Hurricane weather buddy.</i>

109
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,926
<i>My family, we'd be
flying on days like this.</i>

110
00:14:21,928 --> 00:14:24,429
Yeah well, that is crazy.

111
00:14:24,431 --> 00:14:27,332
<i>Most people on earth think what
you're doing's pretty crazy.</i>

112
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,267
It's a calculated risk.

113
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:32,403
<i>Don't you have any worries
that something might go wrong?</i>

114
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,540
Of course I'm worried, but I
only focus on things I control.

115
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:37,342
<i>Like the weather?</i>

116
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,480
<i>Someday.</i>

117
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,119
Yeah!

118
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,270
Stanaforth!

119
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:07,538
You okay?

120
00:15:09,675 --> 00:15:12,310
I had to test
it out. It worked.

121
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:16,581
They're going to
give us the mission.

122
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:20,919
Whoa, I don't know that we're ready
for the mission, Stanaforth.

123
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:23,588
I know.

124
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,990
Over the next five years we could
get 1,000 people up there.

125
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,093
That planet is calling for us.

<i>Careful now. We're

new departure time is in eight hours.</i>

170
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,135
Might as well keep my suit on.

171
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:58,836
Where's the captain?

172
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,173
Hey Worsley,

173
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:04,308
captain Stanaforth is here.
Can you come and say hi?

174
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:07,712
Hey Worsley, how ya doing?

175
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,658
Hey, Worsley.

176
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:33,364
What's going on?

177
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,433
You have plants.

178
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,236
Yeah. For experiments.

179
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,638
You hungry?

180
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,672
We had mice.

181
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,843
We were doing socialization
experiments on the mice,

182
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,246
to see how they would
interact in the air lock.

183
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,483
Have you ever seen a mouse
in zero gravity?

184
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:55,920
They all died.

185
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:57,989
Oh.

186
00:20:58,699 --> 00:20:59,658
Geez, I'm sorry.

187
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:05,363
We thought, maybe they
would form different habits,

188
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:09,934
or become depressed
or even kill each other,

189
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,936
but they didn't.

190
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:14,972
They just died.

191
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,699
No, I didn't mean to, uh...

192
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,036
No, no, no I'm just playing a
song for my daughter back home.

193
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,506
I'm surprised mission
control gives you the time.

194
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,343
Uh, we have a lot of time.

195
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:55,646
Nothing but time.

196
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,049
It must be hard being away
from your daughter so long.

197
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,353
Abort your mission.

198
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:06,390
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

199
00:22:06,392 --> 00:22:10,494
Take all your fancy machines and
go back where you came from.

200
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,336
I'm sorry, what the fuck
are you talking about?

201
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,733
I'm just fucking with you.

202
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:17,902
But seriously, I...

203
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:20,504
You know I came up here
all cowboy like you.

204
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,841
Seeking adventure and all that,

205
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:27,878
but I'm going back. I'm bringing
this experience back with me.

206
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,114
I... I don't get you.

207
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:33,351
I don't wanna go back.
I've seen enough.

208
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,486
How could you
possibly have seen enough?

209
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,423
I mean look at that.
I have tears

210
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,125
every time the sun rises.

211
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,494
Yeah, it's beautiful.

212
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,531
You've only been up,

213
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,367
what three weeks?

214
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:51,469
You haven't forgotten yet.
Once you forget...

215
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:53,838
I don't intend to forget,
but when you're down there

216
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:53,838
everything just gets ruined.

217
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,675
Ah, you callous fuck,
you think you know everything.

218
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:57,675
- You think that...
- Endurance,

219
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:02,480
<i>we've got a live feed of captain
Maddox's launch for you.</i>

You don't know, Stanaforth.

00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,533
Don't go out there

<i>Space station

251

253
00:25:19,719 --> 00:25:23,254
<i>when you're further away than

254
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:24,922
<i>It's amazing.</i>

255
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,191
<i>When you have
this level of distance,</i>

256
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:30,060
<i>there's a strange intimacy.</i>

257
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,065
<i>When I watched earth disappear,</i>

258
00:25:35,067 --> 00:25:38,536
I did remember this one night.

259
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:40,204
My wife Casey,

260
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,705
now ex-wife,

261
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,207
she was receiving
the Melville prize

262
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,109
from some literary society.

263
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,777
This black-tie thing,
and she's...

264
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,780
Talking to these other writers,

265
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:52,116
brilliant people and uh...

266
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:54,652
<i>And they were pouring their hearts out.
It was...</i>

267
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,820
<i>Overwhelming.</i>

268
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,856
So I snuck out.

269
00:25:58,858 --> 00:25:59,990
I didn't even take my coat.

270
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,094
I get out on the street,
I have no idea where I am,

271
00:26:04,096 --> 00:26:06,230
and it's freezing cold,

272
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,265
but the streets are jammed

273
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:11,101
with people, it's like
I'm taking on a current.

274
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,203
I just started walking.

275
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:16,707
<i>But I don't feel cold at all.</i>

276
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,643
And uh...

277
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,646
I turn a corner,

278
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,683
and just then down
at the end of the street,

279
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,651
above the river,

280
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,321
the moon comes up.

281
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,591
And it's huge.

282
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:36,627
Lighting up the street.

283
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:39,863
It feels like I...

284
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:41,865
I just wanna

285
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,034
walk right onto it.

286
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,204
But I freeze.

287
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,908
No one else seems to notice.

288
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:54,945
And in that moment,

289
00:26:55,914 --> 00:26:56,981
I felt...

290
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,020
Completely alone.

291
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,794
<i>I walked back to the dinner,</i>

292
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,863
<i>and I stood outside
and I could see all these...</i>

293
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,365
<i>People celebrating.</i>

294
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:17,234
<i>I saw Casey, she was glowing.</i>

295
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,639
<i>And I knew I should
be in there with her.</i>

296
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,343
<i>But I stood outside
and now I'm shivering.</i>

297
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:30,848
<i>And I just, couldn't go in.</i>

298
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,853
<i>It was like this, this...</i>

299
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:38,389
Loneliness...
This feeling of being...

300
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,327
Completely alone
was inside of me.

301
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:47,898
And if I brought that in...

302
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:52,736
Um...

303
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:55,833
I just shouldn't bring it in.

304
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,372
<i>Minor problem on the reactor,</i>

305
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,274
<i>but it's my job to fix it.</i>

306
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:38,716
<i>I'm glad to have little challenges
to break up my routine.</i>

307
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,923
<i>The ship is going
160,000 miles per hour,</i>

308
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:47,224
<i>but I can't tell I'm moving.</i>

309
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,571
<i>The sun comes through
the window once a week,</i>

310
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,267
<i>and everything repeats.</i>

311
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:03,040
<i>At first, that felt normal.</i>

312
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:18,789
<i>The ship is getting filthy.</i>

313
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:26,130
<i>It's fascinating to witness how much
matter can be generated by plant decay</i>

314
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:27,264
<i>and my own skin.</i>

315
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:51,789
<i>Greenstreet
and Worsley have lost hope.</i>

316
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,052
<i>I think that's because
their experiments failed.</i>

317
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,129
<i>Their families
are waiting for them.</i>

318
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,567
<i>That sense of
disappointment and longing</i>

319
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:05,536
<i>can get in the way
of a mission like mine.</i>

320
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,912
"The impossible..."

321
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:22,286
<i>The struggle to survive
has proven...</i>

322
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:24,488
<i>Uh... the struggle
of this journey</i>

323
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,890
<i>has taken us further...</i>

324
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,092
<i>And...</i>

325
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,961
<i>One step further...</i>

326

327
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:40,337
One step further...

<i>Calling Maddox.</i>

329
00:32:43,027 --> 00:32:45,595
I just had
a dream I was falling.

330
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,333
Ironic, don't you think?

331
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:51,168
<i>That's not a dream.</i>

332
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,235
<i>You are falling.</i>

333
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:54,738

00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,078

00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,420
<i>I'm from México,</i>

347
00:33:43,422 --> 00:33:45,589
<i>and you?
Where are you from?</i>

348
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:46,790
<i>Soy de México, ? Y tú?</i>

349
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:49,359
<i>Soy de earth,</i>

350
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:54,431
<i>I am from Costa Rica.</i>

351
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:56,400
<i>Yo soy de Costa Rica.</i>

352
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:06,710
<i>Marte.</i>

353
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,212
<i>Marte...</i>

354
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:11,748
<i>Voy El Marte.</i>

355
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:14,084
<i>Soy de Marte.</i>

356
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,170
Call Maddox.

357
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:41,711
I guess we're
on our own out here.

358
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,581
Houston,

359
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,716
I seem to have lost the signal.

360
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,221
Houston?

361
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:52,223
Houston?

362
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,225
Skinny, do I have a signal?

363
00:34:58,162 --> 00:34:59,496
What the fuck?

364
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:06,636
Houston, do you read me? This is
captain Stanaforth aboard the <i>Zephyr.</i>

365
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:08,371
I appear to have
lost the signal.

366
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,677
Houston, this is captain
Stanaforth aboard the <i>Zephyr.</i>

367
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,679
Do you read me? I appear
to have lost the signal.

368
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,448
Hello?

369
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,884
Hello, hello!

370
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:22,619
Fuck! Anyone?

371
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:26,656
Skinny, come on.

372
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,625
Can anyone hear me?

373
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,160
<i>Stanaforth, what's going on?</i>

374
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:34,798
Skinny, where the fuck
have you been?

375
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,433
<i>Is everything okay?
What happened?</i>

376
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:38,602
I just, uh, I tried
to reach Maddox,

377
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:41,138
and then you, and...

378
00:35:41,354 --> 00:35:42,373
No one responded.

379
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:46,276
<i>Look, we need you
to go radio silent for a bit</i>

380
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:48,411
<i>while we deal with the
situation with Maddox.</i>

381
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:50,180
Okay. Wait, wait.

382
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:51,615
What's going on with Maddox?
<i>Sit tight.</i>

383
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:53,450
Skinny?

384
00:35:53,452 --> 00:35:55,886
Call Maddox.

385
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:57,554
<i>Calling Maddox.</i>

386
00:35:57,556 --> 00:35:59,890
Maddox, this is Stanaforth.
Do you copy?

387
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:02,492
<i>What are you after?</i>

388
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:04,194
Always pleasant to hear
from you too, captain.

389
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:06,196
I just nearly lost it
missing you.

390
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,265
<i>I'm off course.</i>

391
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:08,265
What?

392
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:13,537
<i>Maddox, when was the last time you
performed maintenance on your gyros?</i>

393
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:16,573
<i>Oh, no, no. You're always
trying to pin this shit on me.</i>

394
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:18,542
<i>Why didn't your
software detect the issue?</i>

395
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:20,610
<i>I'm not trying
to pin anything on you.</i>

396
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:20,610
<i>We've been running
diagnostics down here</i>

397
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:26,383
<i>and we think a malfunction with your
gyroscope is what's causing the issue.</i>

398
00:36:26,385 --> 00:36:28,552
Houston, I can fix
her gyroscopes.

399
00:36:28,554 --> 00:36:29,886
<i>Stand down captain.</i>

400
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:29,886
<i>Houston's taking
care of the issue.</i>

401
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:33,757
And the whole time she's veering
further and further off course.

402
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:36,293
<i>Just let us deal with it, okay?</i>

403
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:38,361
Skinny, I know this
ship from top to bottom,

404
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,930
better than anyone.

405
00:36:39,932 --> 00:36:41,565
Now listen to me Maddox,

406
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,301
you've got something wrong,

407
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:44,301
I probably do, too.

408
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:49,439
<i>Skinny, he's right. You work on
your software, we'll try this.</i>

409
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,374
Get into
the equipment bay, 0-8-2.

410
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,211
Disable your gyros.

411
00:36:54,213 --> 00:36:55,812
<i>0-8-2, copy.</i>

412
00:36:57,448 --> 00:36:58,982
Any condensation on the sensors?

413
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:00,350
<i>I don't see any.</i>

414
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:02,352
Wipe it down anyway and restart.

415
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:02,352
<i>Both of you listen to me.</i>

416
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:05,288
<i>We can handle
this from down here.</i>

417
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:05,922
Did it start?

418
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:10,327
<i>No, but I'm seeing that my
port has a crack in it.</i>

419
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:11,795
Mine looks fine.

420
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:12,929
That must be your problem.

421
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,264
<i>So what's next?</i>

422
00:37:14,266 --> 00:37:15,632
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

423
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:19,569
Go to your bunk monitor.

424
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,805
Pull off the E103 cable.

425
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:23,273
<i>Copy that.</i>

426
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,347
Get a connector from the
mid-deck junction box.

427
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:31,415
<i>Got it.</i>

428
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:35,452
<i>You can't just start pulling
cables out of the wall</i>

429
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:37,587
<i>without asking permission
from engineering.</i>

430
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,257
The engineers will be glad there
are real people here now.

431
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,558
I'm cleaning up their mess.

432
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,026
<i>Stop all right!</i>

433
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,928
Now screw in the four-pin.

434
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,396
Flip it on.

435
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:48,999
<i>It worked.</i>

436
00:37:50,302 --> 00:37:51,368
Fantastic.

437
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,705
<i>Holy shit.</i>

438
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:58,308
<i>I'm starting to get good
readings from down here, too.</i>

439
00:38:00,544 --> 00:38:03,446
<i>Thanks, captain. Hopefully,
we'll end up in the same place.</i>

440
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:29,539
<i>I've climbed almost every
major mountain on earth.</i>

441
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:33,310
<i>I've deep-sea dived,
I've paraglided.</i>

442
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:38,348
<i>Nothing could ever touch
something like going to Mars.</i>

443
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,484
<i>As an engineer, I'm excited for the
technical challenges of the mission.</i>

444
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:44,921
<i>I know that with people all around the
world pushing mankind to get to Mars,</i>

445
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:48,725
<i>we are going to discover things
we can't even dream of now.</i>

446
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:51,728
<i>Great science
will come from this mission...</i>

447
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:54,698
<i>But even greater
inspiration will come</i>

448
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,601
<i>from the simple gesture
of getting there.</i>

449
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,757
<i>this discovery has now
been confirmed with new data,</i>

450
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:23,426
<i>and seems to be correct.</i>

451
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:26,062
<i>The cosmic expansion
that Hubble discovered,</i>

452
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:28,965
<i>is now modulated
by an acceleration term.</i>

453
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:32,035
<i>Its expansion is
ever faster with time,</i>

454
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:37,540
<i>and in that scenario, the universe
ends in a catastrophic crescendo</i>

455
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:40,076
<i>where space-time on the largest
scale is ripped apart,</i>

456
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:43,380
<i>and then within a very short
time, maybe minutes or hours,</i>

457
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:45,448
<i>matter itself is ripped apart.</i>

458
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,518
<i>The atoms of the universe,
all of them...</i>

459
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,630
Grass.

460
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,634
"Fresh-cut grass."

461
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,666
Ugh.

462
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,263
<i>Space is leaking into the ship.</i>

463
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:45,235
Uh, Houston?

464
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:47,737
You won't be able to see
this right now, but I've got

465
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,606
a solar flare coming through.

466
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:53,776
The particles are passing
through my eyes.

467
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:31,834
Two-thirds approximately,
that's...

468
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,202
<i>I fucked up.</i>

469
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,674
<i>I short-circuited the battery,</i>

470
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:39,308
<i>which contaminated
the water supply.</i>

471
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:42,245
<i>Maybe skinny could help.</i>

472
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,248
<i>I trust him,</i>

473
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:46,949
<i>but the situation
isn't desperate yet.</i>

474
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:06,469
<i>I've survived before on 600
milliliters of water a day,</i>

475
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,074
<i>but not for this long.</i>

476
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,813
<i>It's my fault the water
is contaminated, though.</i>

477
00:45:16,815 --> 00:45:19,182
<i>And I'm gonna
be the one to fix it.</i>

478
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:27,023
<i>I have to lie about the reactor,</i>

479
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:30,393
<i>because if skinny finds out,
they'll abort the mission.</i>

480
00:45:58,223 --> 00:46:00,089
Fucking condensation.

481
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,128
<i>There's nothing to look at,</i>

482
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:09,766
<i>but now I can't even
see outside.</i>

483
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,420
<i>Hey, buddy,</i>

484
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:34,157
<i>I haven't talked to you in a couple days.
How are you doing?</i>

485
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:34,157
I'm fine.

486
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:39,562
<i>Look, all the work you're doing on the
reactor's getting people a little worried.</i>

487
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:42,131
<i>Everything okay?</i>

488
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:42,131
Yeah.

489
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:48,571
<i>I want that thing to still be working
if I get up there in a couple years.</i>

490
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:52,975
<i>You know, if anything goes wrong up
there, we'd have to bring you home.</i>

491
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,911
Home? No.

492
00:46:56,046 --> 00:46:59,148
Look, skinny,
essential systems are fine.

493
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,818
I'm just running
some routine maintenance.

494
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,321
<i>Yeah, but I'm getting an earful
from the guys in operations,</i>

495
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,124
<i>and they'd definitely prefer
it if you just left it be.</i>

496
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:09,492
<i>Okay?</i>

497
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,898
Ah!

498
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,457
<i>Can't sleep?</i>

499
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:53,296
Sleep is on the ship
like a ghost.

500
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:57,166
<i>Sorry, what?</i>
Never mind.

501
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:59,502
<i>Why don't you
take a sleeping pill?</i>

502
00:48:59,504 --> 00:49:02,571
I don't like the way
those things make me feel.

503
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:05,574
<i>Well, I'm glad
you're still awake.</i>

504
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:07,543
<i>I have some bad news
about Maddox.</i>

505
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:09,645
Oh, really?

506
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:13,416
<i>The fix you made on her
gyroscope didn't hold.</i>

507
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:16,185
<i>I'm afraid we're going
to have to turn her around.</i>

508
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:20,022
<i>You okay there, captain?</i>

509
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,592
<i>Look, I just need you
to assure me</i>

510
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,695
<i>that you're going to be able
to keep it together up there.</i>

511
00:49:25,697 --> 00:49:28,597
Oh, c'mon, what does that mean, huh?
What does that... I...

512
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,232
What does that even mean?

513
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:33,536
<i>It means stay sane
and stay focused,</i>

514
00:49:33,538 --> 00:49:35,504
<i>so we don't have
any more problems.</i>

515
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:42,078
<i>Stanaforth, I'm waiting for you to tell
me that you're going to be all right.</i>

516
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,047
Well, that is a stupid thing
to wait for.

517
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:51,988
<i>I remember waiting for you to come
out of that desert, you know?</i>

518
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,290
<i>When you finally
got to that rendezvous.</i>

519
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,693
<i>Lookin' like snake skin.</i>

520
00:49:57,695 --> 00:50:00,529
<i>Do you recall what you said to me?
You remember what you said?</i>

521
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:00,529
What?

522
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:06,035
<i>You said, "skinny, I
squeezed water from a stone."</i>

523
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:14,343
Well, that's half true.

524
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:22,518
We really have to
abort her mission?

525
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,787
<i>Yeah, we tried everything.</i>

526
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:27,156
<i>She has to come home, captain.</i>

527
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,386
I'm in here,

528
00:51:00,323 --> 00:51:02,792
and every single
other thing is out there.

529
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:24,567
<i>Condensation.</i>

530
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:29,338
<i>It's as dry as a desert in here,</i>

531
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,842
<i>but it's a closed system.</i>

532
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,933
<i>The ship,</i>

533
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,302
<i>the plants,</i>

534
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,642
<i>they have to give up
their water for me.</i>

535
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,360
I'm sorry.

536
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,396
Come on.

537
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:31,367
<i>It's all connected.</i>

538
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:44,780
<i>I just have to replicate
systems that work in nature.</i>

539
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,837
<i>Hope is out there.</i>

540
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,472
<i>Super-heat the soil,
compress it.</i>

541
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:51,480
<i>Extract the hydrogen and the
oxygen, recombine them.</i>

542
00:55:57,620 --> 00:56:01,357
<i>This is how the
universe made water.</i>

543
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,425
<i>This is how life
on earth formed.</i>

544
00:56:24,814 --> 00:56:27,416
<i>And I'm trying to
recreate the process.</i>

545
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,683
<i>I might have enough water
to survive the journey.</i>

546
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,963
<i>But if I can't make
the reactor work,</i>

547
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,598
<i>what's the point?</i>

548
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:54,870
<i>I'll just die alone on Mars.</i>

549
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,575
Come on.

550
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,748
Ah! Fuck!

551
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,952
Goddammit.

552
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:17,860
Work with me, you stupid
piece of fucking junk!

553
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:30,172
Shit, I'm sorry.

554
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:32,975
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

555
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:44,786
<i>Jesus, captain, what's going on?</i>

556
00:58:44,788 --> 00:58:47,589
<i>You look like shit,
the ship's a mess.</i>

557
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,759
<i>People are worried about you.</i>

558
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:54,596
<i>Everyone's asking me
what's going on with you,</i>

559
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:56,865
<i>and I don't know
what to tell them.</i>

560
00:58:58,835 --> 00:58:59,935
<i>Huh?</i>

561
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:06,275
<i>Stanaforth, c'mon you
gotta talk to me here.</i>

562
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:11,980
Skinny, I fucked up.

563
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,784
I, uh...

564
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:20,122
I plugged into the...
Yeah, my...

565
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:24,660
My power is...
My water supply's fucked.

566
00:59:24,662 --> 00:59:26,295
I poisoned the supply.

567
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:27,663
<i>What?</i>

568
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,198
<i>How is that possible?</i>

569
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,101
<i>What happened?</i>

570
00:59:33,103 --> 00:59:36,238
I just thought I knew...

571
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:42,744
What it would be like, but I just...
I don't know, I...

572
00:59:42,746 --> 00:59:47,015
<i>Okay, look. Protocol dictates
you return to earth right now.</i>

573
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:49,685
<i>Abort the mission, get you home.</i>

574
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:52,321
<i>Hopefully we can
bring you back safely.</i>

575
00:59:52,323 --> 00:59:52,321
<i>But what have you tried already?</i>

576
00:59:52,323 --> 00:59:58,260
<i>Is there anything that we can
do to get it working again?</i>

577
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:02,097
<i>We'll have at least a day or two before
we're able to turn you around and...</i>

578
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:05,334
<i>I know this ship
better than anyone.</i>

579
01:00:09,973 --> 01:00:12,074
<i>I couldn't get it to work.</i>

580
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:52,914
<i>It's amazing that we can build these
machines to shoot us through space.</i>

581
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:57,352
<i>But in the end we're just these
fragile little creatures</i>

582
01:00:57,354 --> 01:01:01,223
<i>staring out
at the universe, learning.</i>

583
01:01:01,225 --> 01:01:03,859
<i>The important thing
is not the technology,</i>

584
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:06,294
<i>but the humanity.</i>

585
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:12,334
<i>The technology enables us to experience
something really astonishing.</i>

586
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:16,838
<i>To walk on Mars, to watch the
sunset from another planet.</i>

587
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:22,411
<i>That kind of raw
emotional experience</i>

588
01:01:22,413 --> 01:01:25,881
<i>is what's really significant
in this journey.</i>

589
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:29,184
<i>End transmission.</i>

590
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,326
<i>I thought I had
everything figured out.</i>

591
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:49,805
<i>I spent years
planning this mission.</i>

592
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:58,947
<i>I designed a machine so we
could live on another planet.</i>

593
01:02:02,018 --> 01:02:04,419
<i>I made this thing
work in the desert but...</i>

594
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:09,758
<i>But that wasn't
the reason I, um...</i>

595
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,728
<i>That wasn't the moment.</i>

596
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,099
I drank the land.

597
01:02:22,371 --> 01:02:25,941
But just when I got it working,

598
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:28,744
the minute I was
gonna take a drink...

599
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:34,783
My foot, my leg
went numb. Bang.

600
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:37,185
I collapsed.

601
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,324
I tried to take a drink,
I couldn't...

602
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,962
I couldn't grip the bottle.
My hand was like...

603
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:51,233
Air.

604
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:55,337
<i>I thought I was evaporating.</i>

605
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:01,343
<i>I lay down in the sand,</i>

606
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:03,044
<i>I wove myself in.</i>

607
01:03:08,184 --> 01:03:09,985
And this barrier

608
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:14,156
between me and everything

609
01:03:15,491 --> 01:03:17,359
just dissolved.

610
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:24,800
And I could die,

611
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:28,904
because life is enormous.

612
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:34,142
And I loved
the feeling of dying,

613
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:40,949
and then it passed.

614
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:43,985
The feeling passed.

615
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:48,223
I could feel my hands,

616
01:03:48,225 --> 01:03:52,394
my feet. I got up,
I walked to the rendezvous.

617
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:57,866
And I made up my mind
right there and then.

618
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,904
To go on a one-way
mission to Mars.

619
01:04:39,443 --> 01:04:41,076
<i>Good morning, Stanaforth.</i>

620
01:04:41,078 --> 01:04:43,879
<i>Time to put on your flight suit.</i>

621
01:04:43,881 --> 01:04:46,648
<i>Houston will be taking
the wheel for the turnaround,</i>

622
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:50,318
<i>but we're gonna need you in the
cockpit in case of an emergency.</i>

623
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:54,055
<i>Fuel has been sent up
to the space station.</i>

624
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:57,525
<i>That'll get you the rest
of the way home and...</i>

625
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:06,067
<i>The mission has failed,</i>

626
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:11,439
<i>but I can't go back.</i>

627
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:23,418
<i>I don't care
if the machines don't work,</i>

628
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,155
<i>if no one else is coming.</i>

629
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:35,030
<i>I know what waits
for me on earth,</i>

630
01:05:39,468 --> 01:05:41,236
<i>but not up there.</i>

631
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:46,308
<i>What are you doing?
What's going on?</i>

632
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:51,179
<i>Did you just
override the controls?</i>

633
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:56,084
<i>Stanaforth, you will wind up off course.
Do you understand me?</i>

634
01:06:02,425 --> 01:06:05,427
<i>You're gonna end up off course.</i>

635
01:06:05,429 --> 01:06:05,427
<i>Are you listening?</i>

636
01:06:05,429 --> 01:06:12,367
<i>I'm trying to help you. Goddammit,
Stanaforth, stop! That's an order, captain.</i>

637
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:13,969
<i>Stanaforth!</i>

638
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:37,278
<i>I hope someone, someday,
will read this journal.</i>

639
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:41,850
<i>I don't know if I'm on course.</i>

640
01:08:41,852 --> 01:08:44,219
<i>My ship isn't telling me.</i>

641
01:08:49,358 --> 01:08:54,195
<i>If I miscalculated, I'll miss
Mars by a million miles,</i>

642
01:08:55,564 --> 01:08:59,134
<i>drifting into space forever.</i>

643
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,485
<i>I keep up my routine,</i>

644
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,621
<i>but I've lost hope
in the mission.</i>

645
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:05,266
Hoe!

646
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:08,937
Huh, huh, huh,

647
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:14,642
hoe, hoe, hoe.

648
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:16,945
Hoe!

649
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:40,468
<i>So many people wanted
to be part of this journey,</i>

650
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:43,271
<i>and sent me messages
along the way.</i>

651
01:10:45,841 --> 01:10:47,242
<i>I let you down.</i>

652
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:08,896
<i>Maddox trusted me,</i>

653
01:11:10,733 --> 01:11:12,267
<i>and then I failed.</i>

654
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,872
<i>I hope someday you get
another mission.</i>

655
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:22,577
<i>To keep going with
what we started.</i>

656
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,764
<i>And skinny...</i>

657
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:48,403
<i>I can almost hear you out there,</i>

658
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:50,471
<i>trying to reach me.</i>

659
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:54,776
<i>Now that I'm not
going to make it,</i>

660
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,379
<i>you must feel like I do.</i>

661
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:01,449
<i>Broken.</i>

662
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:04,719
<i>Empty.</i>

663
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:35,416
<i>For me, I'm trapped
inside my own machine.</i>

664
01:12:38,954 --> 01:12:41,823
<i>Pressed down by gravity.</i>

665
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:47,061
<i>Wringing out the last
drops of water,</i>

666
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:48,796
<i>withering away.</i>

667
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:56,537
<i>What does it matter
if I live another day,</i>

668
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:59,774
<i>another week, drying
up in this tiny box?</i>

669
01:13:06,448 --> 01:13:08,549
This is all I have left to give.

670
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:15,390
<i>I want to get out there.</i>

671
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:25,800
<i>I wanna be ripped apart
by space, overwhelmed.</i>

672
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:33,574
<i>Why not open the hatch
and step outside?</i>

673
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:01,103
<i>Stanaf...</i>

674
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:05,773
<i>I'm trying to...</i>

675
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:06,775
<i>If you...</i>

676
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:12,079
<i>Stana... skinny,
are you there...</i>

677
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:24,592
<i>Houston, trying to reach...</i>

678
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:31,232
<i>If you're alive...
Let us know...</i>

679
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:34,101
<i>Can you hear...</i>

680
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:39,941
<i>If you... signal...</i>

681
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:41,008
<i>Get through the...</i>

682
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:44,512
<i>Stanaforth, are you...</i>

683
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,516
<i>Magnetic storm...</i>

684
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:50,885
<i>You're close to a...</i>

685
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:57,859
<i>Storm safely...
You'll be there...</i>

686
01:14:58,727 --> 01:14:59,827
<i>Close...</i>

687
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:06,100
<i>We're rooting for you...</i>

688
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:07,235
Skinny...

689
01:15:07,237 --> 01:15:08,603
<i>Whole world...</i>

690
01:15:08,605 --> 01:15:09,670
It's me.

691
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:14,175
<i>Stanaforth, come in.</i>

692
01:15:14,177 --> 01:15:16,844
Yeah, I'm here. I'm...

693
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:20,214
<i>Skinny... so...</i>

694
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:23,618
<i>You're so close.</i>

695
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:36,691
This is it.

696
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:04,685
<i>Our bodies are
more space than matter.</i>

697
01:17:07,723 --> 01:17:10,758
<i>There's an unfathomable
distance between each atom,</i>

698
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:12,727
<i>each particle.</i>

699
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:22,703
<i>What keeps us solid?</i>

700
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:30,044
<i>Why don't we dissolve?</i>

701
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,251
<i>This is why I came here.</i>

702
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,724
<i>To give everything up.</i>

703
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:51,399
<i>For one moment of pure wonder.</i>

704
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:36,911
<i>I don't know if anyone can
hear me, but here goes.</i>

705
01:18:36,913 --> 01:18:40,014
Houston, Zephyr is go
for landing.

706
01:18:49,758 --> 01:18:51,025
Zephyr released.

707
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:09,877
Three minutes.

708
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,365
Two minutes, fuel light is on.

709
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:53,087
One minute.

710
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:01,195
There's the spot!

711
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,368
Thirty meters, two down.

712
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:10,070
Ten meters, three forward.

713
01:20:10,072 --> 01:20:12,006
Five meters.

714
01:20:17,547 --> 01:20:19,446
Down.

715
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:28,355
<i>Houston, this is captain William d.
Stanaforth on the surface of Mars.</i>

716
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:51,171
<i>Nothing has ever lived here.</i>

717
01:22:00,548 --> 01:22:02,917
<i>Nothing has ever died here.</i>

718
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:18,232
<i>Maybe I'll live forever.</i>
