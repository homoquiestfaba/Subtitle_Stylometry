had long been forbidden precisely...

My brothers used to
tease me awfully when I played.

180

I lost both of them.

181

182
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:33,714
Just must be so confusing for my parents.

183
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,792
I mean, if a wife loses a husband

184
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:37,950
she becomes a widow,

185
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,550
but if a parent loses a child

186
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,951
there's no special label for it.

187
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,077
You're still a mother or father.

188

Even if you no longer have a child.

189
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,833

190
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,111
if I'm still technically a sister

191

192

How long were you there, in the War?

193
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:11,280
Nearly four years.

205
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,031
No love lost there.

I suppose it made it easier

212

knowing there'd be no one

am I allowed to talk about the future?

We can't rightly talk about the future
if you think about it.

what we imagine or wish for.

and what you said.

You were right.

I suppose that's why I came to Janus

because out here there is no one to hurt.

01:52:55,230 --> 01:52:57,550
TOM: Isabel, love.

1432
01:52:57,630 --> 01:52:59,553
I couldn't go on the way things were.

1433
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:03,071
I couldn't live with myself.

1434
01:53:03,550 --> 01:53:07,236
I'm sorrier than
I'll ever be able to say for hurting you.

1435
01:53:09,470 --> 01:53:12,076
We each get a little turn at life.

1436
01:53:12,510 --> 01:53:15,870
And if this ends up being
how my turn went,

1437
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:17,952
it will still have been worth it.

1438
01:53:19,670 --> 01:53:22,401
My time should have been up years ago.

1439
01:53:22,910 --> 01:53:24,719
To have met you,

1440
01:53:24,870 --> 01:53:27,316
when I thought life was over.

1441
01:53:27,910 --> 01:53:30,151
And been loved by you.

1442
01:53:31,230 --> 01:53:32,870
If I lived another 100 years,

1443
01:53:32,950 --> 01:53:35,476
I couldn't ask for better than that.

1444
01:53:36,750 --> 01:53:39,870
I have loved you
as best as I know, Isabel.

1445
01:53:39,950 --> 01:53:42,271
Which isn't saying much.

1446
01:53:43,790 --> 01:53:46,555
You deserved someone a lot better than me.

1447
01:53:48,070 --> 01:53:49,834
All I can do is ask God.

1448
01:53:50,030 --> 01:53:54,001
And ask you to forgive me
for the harm I've caused.

1449
01:53:55,110 --> 01:53:58,557
And to thank you for
every day we spent together.

1450
01:53:58,950 --> 01:54:01,950
I will always be your loving husband.

1451
01:54:02,030 --> 01:54:03,361
Tom.

1452
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:22,435
(PANTING)

1453
01:54:23,630 --> 01:54:24,756
I need to see my husband.

1454
01:54:25,670 --> 01:54:27,470
He's already gone.

1455
01:54:27,550 --> 01:54:28,750
Where?

1456
01:54:28,830 --> 01:54:29,991
He's on the boat.

1457

(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)

1458
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:51,996
- SERGEANT SPRAGG: That one?
- GARSTONE: That one.

1459
01:55:07,470 --> 01:55:09,313
- Hi, Tom.
- TOM: Ralph.

1460
01:55:12,150 --> 01:55:13,270
Where's Blue?

1461
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:15,159
Um, couldn't make it.

1462
01:55:19,470 --> 01:55:21,234
ISABEL: Tom!

1463
01:55:22,590 --> 01:55:23,921
(PANTING)

1464
01:55:28,070 --> 01:55:29,401
We need to go.

1465
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:31,471
Tom?

1466
01:55:33,990 --> 01:55:36,197
Cast off now, Ralph!

1467
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:39,670
Don't, Isabel.

1468
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:41,240
I just want to say goodbye.

1469
01:55:42,430 --> 01:55:43,955
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1470
01:55:45,870 --> 01:55:47,554
- (CRYING)
- It's all right.

1471
01:55:48,230 --> 01:55:49,391
Shh.

1472
01:55:50,710 --> 01:55:52,474
- Tom!
- Shh!

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1474
01:55:54,430 --> 01:55:55,591
Shh.

1475
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:58,040
It's all right. It's all right.

1476
01:56:00,470 --> 01:56:02,871
- It's not true!
- Shh!

1477
01:56:04,990 --> 01:56:06,958
- It's not true!
- Just leave things be.

1478
01:56:07,430 --> 01:56:08,761
Isabel...

1479
01:56:09,110 --> 01:56:11,710
Frank was dead when
the boat washed up. It was my idea.

1480
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:12,990
- Don't say any more.
- I stopped him from

1481
01:56:13,070 --> 01:56:15,641
reporting the boat. It's my fault.

1482
01:56:18,350 --> 01:56:19,476
It's my fault.

1483
01:56:22,670 --> 01:56:23,956
I'm sorry.

1484
01:56:25,230 --> 01:56:26,561
(INHALES)

1485
01:56:30,630 --> 01:56:31,790
It's all right.

1486
01:56:31,870 --> 01:56:33,998
- Tom...
- Don't say any more.

1487
01:56:41,310 --> 01:56:43,153
HANNAH: She said that?

1488
01:56:43,470 --> 01:56:44,756
SERGEANT KNUCKEY: Yes.

1489
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:47,635
She was a decent girl
before she went out on Janus.

1490
01:56:49,510 --> 01:56:52,559
Being out on that island
didn't do her any good at all.

1491
01:56:53,150 --> 01:56:55,152
What happens to them now?

1492
01:56:57,030 --> 01:56:58,680
They go to jail.

1493
01:57:01,870 --> 01:57:03,440
They go to jail.

1494
01:57:10,310 --> 01:57:11,641
For how long?

1495
01:57:11,790 --> 01:57:14,361
Long enough to think
about what they've done.

1496
01:57:15,830 --> 01:57:17,878
Think they need jail for that?

1497
01:57:19,390 --> 01:57:22,470
Mrs. Roennfeldt, people are responsible

1498
01:57:22,550 --> 01:57:24,393
for their own actions.

1499
01:57:25,470 --> 01:57:27,310
And when they cross certain lines,

1500
01:57:27,390 --> 01:57:29,552
there needs to be consequence.

1501
01:57:30,950 --> 01:57:33,157
What if I spoke for them?

1502
01:57:34,030 --> 01:57:35,230
Asked for clemency?

1503
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:36,436
Clemency?

1504
01:57:37,430 --> 01:57:39,159
What would happen then?

1505
01:57:39,990 --> 01:57:42,721
Some fines, a few months jail, maybe.

1506
01:57:43,630 --> 01:57:45,712
Why would you do that?

1507
01:57:46,470 --> 01:57:49,076
Because you only have to forgive once.

1508
01:57:50,350 --> 01:57:52,318
Thank you very much, Sergeant.

1509
01:57:52,710 --> 01:57:54,041
(CLOCK TICKING)

1510
01:57:55,070 --> 01:57:57,311
Do you think you could
find your own way out?

1511
01:58:02,030 --> 01:58:03,600
Thank you for the tea, Mrs. Roennfeldt.

1512

(HANNAH SIGHS)

1513
01:58:33,470 --> 01:58:35,438
Good to see a smile, girlie.

1514
01:58:37,030 --> 01:58:40,239
I know you've been sad.
You missed your old life.

1515
01:58:40,670 --> 01:58:41,750
I do.

1516
01:58:41,830 --> 01:58:45,350
I know what that's like
because that's what happened to me.

1517
01:58:45,430 --> 01:58:47,353
I had to say goodbye to my mum.

1518
01:58:47,510 --> 01:58:48,550
Your mum?

1519
01:58:48,630 --> 01:58:50,917
I had to go across
the sea in a sailing ship.

1520
01:58:51,470 --> 01:58:53,190
And when I wasn't much older than you.

1521
01:58:53,270 --> 01:58:56,274
I came here and I got a new mum and dad.

1522
01:58:56,430 --> 01:58:58,430
They looked after me from then on.

1523
01:58:58,510 --> 01:59:00,000
They loved me.

1524
01:59:00,750 --> 01:59:02,991
Just like my Hannah loves you.

1525
01:59:04,110 --> 01:59:06,192
You know who was a good rider
when they were little?

1526
01:59:06,790 --> 01:59:08,076
My Hannah!

1527
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:11,441
She was good at everything
when she was a little one.

1528
01:59:11,910 --> 01:59:14,641
Always kept me on my toes. Just like you.

1529
01:59:15,590 --> 01:59:17,797
My saving Grace, you are.

1530
01:59:17,950 --> 01:59:19,475
I'm not Grace.

1531
01:59:20,590 --> 01:59:24,276
You know you were called Grace
from the day you were born.

1532
01:59:24,590 --> 01:59:27,196
But I want to be called Lucy.

1533
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:30,081
Why don't I call you Lucy-Grace?

1534
01:59:30,230 --> 01:59:31,310
Yeah!

1535
01:59:31,390 --> 01:59:34,310
Yes? Have we got a deal?

1536
01:59:34,390 --> 01:59:35,676
LUCY: Mmm-hmm.

1537
01:59:40,910 --> 01:59:41,991
Hi!

1538
01:59:45,870 --> 01:59:47,474
We're back.

1539
01:59:47,630 --> 01:59:48,916
Surprise!

1540
01:59:51,950 --> 01:59:54,710
(WHISPERING) You tell Hannah
about all the birdies that you saw.

1541
01:59:54,790 --> 01:59:55,951
How many did you see?

1542
01:59:57,310 --> 01:59:58,430
Five.

SEPTIMUS: Oh, that's good.

1544
02:00:01,230 --> 02:00:04,150
You've been with Grandpa?
He's been looking after you?

1545
02:00:04,230 --> 02:00:06,153
- Yeah.
- Shall I...

1546
02:00:06,590 --> 02:00:08,831
Shall I show you how
to make a daisy chain?

1547
02:00:08,950 --> 02:00:10,395
- Yeah.
- Yes!

1548
02:00:10,950 --> 02:00:12,793
- Do you know how?
- No.

1549
02:00:12,910 --> 02:00:14,435
I'm going to show you.

1550
02:00:14,950 --> 02:00:19,353
A little hole. There's a hole.
Can you stick it through?

1551
02:00:20,110 --> 02:00:22,841
Look at that! Well done, darling.

1552
02:00:23,870 --> 02:00:26,271
Then we can join them all together.

1553

Look at this!

1554
02:00:29,150 --> 02:00:30,870
Do you like a crown?

1555
02:00:30,950 --> 02:00:31,951
Yeah.

1556
02:00:32,870 --> 02:00:34,360
- Pretty?
- Yeah.

1557
02:00:34,510 --> 02:00:36,239
- Would you like to wear it?
- Yeah.

1558
02:00:36,350 --> 02:00:38,034
Should we put it on you?

1559
02:00:38,390 --> 02:00:40,313
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1561
02:00:42,710 --> 02:00:45,361
Oh, that looks so pretty.

1562
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:50,673
Oh, it's come off.
How about we put it around me?

1563
02:00:51,110 --> 02:00:54,470
Make a daisy necklace? Let's try.

1564
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:56,234
How about we, Grandpa...

1565
02:00:56,390 --> 02:00:58,590
How about you could wear it on your head?

1566
02:00:58,670 --> 02:01:00,950
All right. You want to put it on my head?

1567
02:01:01,030 --> 02:01:02,230
And you could keep it.

1568
02:01:02,310 --> 02:01:04,551
All right. Thank you, darling.

1569
02:01:05,790 --> 02:01:07,076

1572
02:01:35,470 --> 02:01:38,041

02:02:20,310 --> 02:02:21,470
Hope not.

TOM: She never stopped talking about you.

1586
02:03:06,630 --> 02:03:08,359
She always hoped you would come.

1587
02:03:11,510 --> 02:03:13,558
I couldn't come any sooner.

I never had the chance to say thank you.
To both of you.

For saving me.

1590

(SOFTLY) Hey.

1594
02:03:37,510 --> 02:03:39,239
She left something for you.

It has been such a long time.

Hey.

1598
02:04:32,030 --> 02:04:33,191
I'd promised

I'd stay away from you
and I've stuck to my word.

Knowing you were safe and loved

our lives away from you.

1608
02:05:08,950 --> 02:05:11,271
I hope life has been kind to you.

1609
02:05:13,110 --> 02:05:16,239
I hope that you can forgive me
for keeping you.

1610
02:05:17,670 --> 02:05:19,638
And for letting you go.

1611
02:05:21,590 --> 02:05:27,518
Know that you have always been beloved.

1612
02:05:43,190 --> 02:05:44,760
TOM: Look at you.

1613
02:05:46,510 --> 02:05:49,992
Isabel would have just
loved to have met you.

1614
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:55,039
She would have loved you.

1615
02:06:03,510 --> 02:06:07,634
Could Christopher and I come back
and visit you again?

1616
02:06:10,830 --> 02:06:12,958
I would like that very much.

1617
02:06:16,350 --> 02:06:18,000
Great. (CHUCKLES)
