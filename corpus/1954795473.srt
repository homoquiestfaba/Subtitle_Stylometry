1
00:01:34,355 --> 00:01:36,088
Tonight.

2
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,090
Dori. Dori, listen.
I-I-I don't know.

3
00:01:38,092 --> 00:01:39,658
Yes, please, please, please.
No. Listen.

4
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,792
You have to. Listen to me.

5
00:01:40,794 --> 00:01:42,393
Listen, I don't...
I don't think I...

6
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:43,794
oh, no.

7
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:45,395
Uh, no, thank you.

8
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,133
Woman: Land here is
extraordinarily valuable.

9
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:53,235
Millions and millions
of dollars.

10
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:56,137
Agriculture really isn't
the way to go anymore.

11
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:58,472
The real value is in tourism.
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

12
00:01:58,474 --> 00:01:59,473
I... no, thank you.

13
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:01,107
I'm seeing hotels... Uh-huh.

14
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:03,209
Resorts, casinos, the works.
Uh-huh.

15
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:04,761
You know?

16
00:02:04,762 --> 00:02:06,312
If you're really serious
about this, here's my card.

17
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:07,680
You call me any time you like.

18
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:09,348
Thank you. You're welcome.

19
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:12,250
Oh, honey, I want you
to meet Dr. Matthew hope.

20
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:14,685
Doctor, this is my honey
and partner... Scott.

21
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:17,421
How do you do?

22
00:02:17,422 --> 00:02:20,156
I've just been considering your
lady's real estate, um, tips.

23
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,292
Such a pleasure.

24
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:26,261
Ooh, wicked girls.

25
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:30,164
Not for long.

26
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,299
Woman: All I want is
jerk chicken, jerk fish,

27
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:34,401
jerk pork...

28
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:40,239
More jerk chicken, sir?

29
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:43,742
She's a work of art,
isn't she, superintendent?

30
00:02:43,744 --> 00:02:46,344
Which I will own someday.

31
00:02:47,613 --> 00:02:49,446
I don't believe she's for sale.

32
00:02:49,448 --> 00:02:52,248
Everyone is for sale, doctor.

33
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,716
Really?

34
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:55,250
How's your jerk?

35
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:57,885
Man: Attention, everybody.

36
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,519
Please...

37
00:02:59,521 --> 00:03:01,254
Settle everybody.

38
00:03:02,257 --> 00:03:04,190
Settle.

39
00:03:04,192 --> 00:03:06,225
Thank you.

40
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,826
Now, we've all gathered
here today

41
00:03:07,828 --> 00:03:09,260
for a very special occasion...

42
00:03:09,262 --> 00:03:11,929
my baby brother Wesley's
birthday.

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,434
And I know you were all looking
forward to partying

44
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:19,869
with the island wild man...
as I was...

45
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:22,738
but, unfortunately,
Dr. Winsvold has informed me

46
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,574
that Wesley is feeling
a bit under the weather.

47
00:03:25,576 --> 00:03:27,576
Aw! Aw! Aw! Aw!

48
00:03:27,578 --> 00:03:30,211
So, if you'll join me
in a toast

49
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:31,745
to Wesley's good health...
to Wesley!

50
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:33,713
To Wesley! To Wesley! To Wesley!
To Wesley!

51
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:35,581
Rock on!

52
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,435
¶ Sooner or later ¶

53
00:05:14,437 --> 00:05:17,404
¶ When the love... ¶

54
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:29,048
¶ hurts you like she's done
in the past ¶

55
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:35,386
Dori, listen, I know I
said I'd help you, but...

56
00:05:35,388 --> 00:05:37,855
It's... it's just too
dangerous right now and...

57
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:39,990
You said it would be easy
to do a DNA test

58
00:05:39,992 --> 00:05:42,025
to tell who the father
of the baby is.

59
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:43,626
It's too dangerous.

60
00:05:43,628 --> 00:05:44,994
No, stop this, please.

61
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:46,895
Don't... I-I... Look, I-I...

62
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:48,963
Come on. Please. You promised.

63
00:05:48,965 --> 00:05:51,031
Dori, this is very dangerous.

64
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:56,001
Oh, my God, dori.

65
00:05:56,003 --> 00:05:58,737
This... dori, we shouldn't
be doing this.

66
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:01,906
Dori, we shou... just...

67
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:03,440
God!

68
00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:05,308
Please, please, please...

69
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,409
the test first.

70
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:07,410
No, no.

71
00:06:07,412 --> 00:06:09,012
Yes, sir.

72
00:06:09,013 --> 00:06:10,613
I'll be more relaxed
when I know, yeah?

73
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:11,847
Yeah?

74
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:13,348
Please?

75
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,316
Yes.

76
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,665
Uh-huh.

77
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:47,441
¶ Let's get back to what ¶

78
00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:51,578
¶ real-ly ma-tters... ¶

79
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,618
Oh, God.

80
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,353
Oh, God.

81
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,592
My God. Oh, my God.

82
00:08:27,493 --> 00:08:29,559
Man: Doctor?

83
00:08:30,562 --> 00:08:31,561
Doctor?

84
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:35,064
¶ To what really matters... ¶

85
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,969
¶ Oh... ¶

86
00:08:41,971 --> 00:08:43,637
He's dead.

87
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:55,680
Oh, move, move, move, move!

88
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:03,986
Squeeze my hand.

89
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:06,621
Woman on p.A.:
...To cardiology.

90
00:09:06,623 --> 00:09:07,521
Hey...

91
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:15,594
Help... Me.

92
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,330
I will, honey.

93
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:20,064
How close are we
to maximum dosage?

94
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:21,466
We're there.

95
00:09:22,902 --> 00:09:25,469
Dr. Javitz...

96
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:27,237
Dr. Javitz.

97
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,504
Oh, Alice, you're going down?

98
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:30,506
No, Dr. Javitz,
it's Jenny Garcia.

99
00:09:30,508 --> 00:09:32,641
I know. Nothing's working. No,
please, just hear me out.

100
00:09:32,643 --> 00:09:34,643
I know you said no
to the raptomycin,

101
00:09:34,645 --> 00:09:36,161
but we've got nothing to lose,

102
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:37,678
and it's been working really
well in the clinical trials.

103
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:38,813
For God's sake, that's enough.

104
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,714
The review board
takes a long time

105
00:09:40,716 --> 00:09:42,749
to determine compassionate use,

106
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:44,650
and you don't want me
to repeat my speech

107
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:46,785
on the use
of non-fda-approved drugs

108
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:49,487
and disastrous
career consequences.

109
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:50,755
This child
is not gonna make it.

110
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,724
Do not turn me into
the heartless, crusty,

111
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:54,791
head of a department

112
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:57,344
who's going to be making
big speeches

113
00:09:57,345 --> 00:09:59,896
about liability and insurance
companies and all that crap.

114
00:09:59,898 --> 00:10:01,631
You know better.

115
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:05,584
Hey, Phil.

116
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:07,902
To what do I owe the pleasure?
Can I have an amp of raptomycin?

117
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:09,370
Dr. Javitz and the review board
gave you the thumbs-up

118
00:10:09,372 --> 00:10:10,371
for compassionate use?

119
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:11,605
Uh-huh. Really?

120
00:10:11,607 --> 00:10:12,772
Do you have it in writing?

121
00:10:12,774 --> 00:10:14,173
Look, Phil,
I'm in a huge hurry.

122
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:15,307
I don't have time for this.

123
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:17,042
I told you I got
the approval, all right?

124
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,616
You know what they say...

125
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:28,752
No good deed goes unpunished.

126
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:34,757
That's a chance
I'll have to take.

127
00:10:49,637 --> 00:10:51,770
Code blue!

128
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:22,101
Oh!

129
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:23,818
Well, if you expect me
to jump on a chair,

130
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:24,986
don't hold your breath.

131
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:26,787
How 'bout a piece of cheese?

132
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,192
Help... Me.

133
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:55,345
Dr. Javitz: "Dear Dr. Dodgson,
you are a talented doctor,

134
00:12:55,347 --> 00:12:58,081
"a caring person,
and under no circumstances

135
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:01,084
"should you blame
yourself for Jenny's death.

136
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:03,386
"However,
by prescribing raptomycin

137
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:06,222
"and disobeying
my specific instructions,

138
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:10,059
"you have compromised this
institution's legal standing.

139
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:11,894
"I have no choice
but to recommend

140
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:15,497
"that your license be suspended
for no less than two years.

141
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:18,333
Yours, Dr. Javitz."

142
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,976
Alice: Dr. Javitz.

143
00:13:29,978 --> 00:13:33,813
Yes, it's...
it's Alice dodgson.

144
00:13:33,815 --> 00:13:37,416
Yeah, I-I'm calling to...
to ask you for a favor if...

145
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:40,085
if you think that's appropriate.

146
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:43,388
I'm... I realize that I can't
practice medicine

147
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,523
for the next two years, but...

148
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:48,292
Well, there... there is
a medical referral service,

149
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:51,495
and they're offering
an overseas position

150
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,097
which doesn't require
a license.

151
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:58,501
Yeah, the patient was diagnosed
with atypical lymphocytosis,

152
00:13:58,503 --> 00:14:01,370
slipped into a coma
twice last year.

153
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:05,107
Lives in Jamaica...
some out-of-the-way place.

154
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:08,210
They want someone to give
supportive care.

155
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,048
Oh, well, I'm...
I'm calling you because...

156
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,384
Because I... well, they do ask
for a reference,

157
00:14:16,386 --> 00:14:18,552
and although I do have
other references,

158
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:23,156
I... I think
that they should know

159
00:14:23,158 --> 00:14:25,158
why I had my license suspended

160
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,261
before they decide whether
or not they want to hire me.

161
00:14:41,174 --> 00:14:43,541
Woman: Welcome.
Welcome to Jamaica.

162
00:14:43,543 --> 00:14:44,575
Welcome.

163
00:14:44,577 --> 00:14:46,543
Welcome to Jamaica.

164
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:49,279
Hope you enjoy your stay.

165
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:54,150
¶ Way back in the day... ¶

166
00:14:54,152 --> 00:14:57,353
¶ the vibes and the drum
and the bass ¶

167
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,088
hey...

168
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:00,889
How you doin'?

169
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:02,957
I am fine, baby girl.

170
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,060
And you are very fine, too,
you know.

171
00:15:06,062 --> 00:15:07,494
But me at work now.

172
00:15:07,496 --> 00:15:11,397
Normally, I would love to make
your acquaintance

173
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,334
and show you a good time,
but me have to work.

174
00:15:15,336 --> 00:15:18,236
I'm... I'm Dr. Dodgson.

175
00:15:24,242 --> 00:15:26,075
I'm j.B. I'm sorry.

176
00:15:26,077 --> 00:15:27,376
Can I help you?

177
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:28,577
No, I'm fine.

178
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:30,912
Yes. Actually, very fine.

179
00:15:30,914 --> 00:15:32,613
Yes, yes.

180
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:34,381
So, you are from New York?

181
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:35,949
Alice: Uh-huh. Yeah, man.

182
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:38,184
Me, I want to go to New York
and live there, you know.

183
00:15:38,186 --> 00:15:40,920
Really? I thought Jamaica
was like a paradise.

184
00:15:40,922 --> 00:15:42,288
For tourists.

185
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,658
For Jamaicans,
life is very hard, you know.

186
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:53,165
Why does everyone
carry machetes?

187
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,266
For work.

188
00:15:54,268 --> 00:15:56,134
And protection.

189
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:05,141
Are the mountains dangerous?

190
00:16:05,143 --> 00:16:06,142
Hmm.

191
00:16:06,144 --> 00:16:08,210
Some parts, yes.

192
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:12,980
Like I said,
life can be very hard here.

193
00:16:12,982 --> 00:16:15,582
The people are very, very poor.

194
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:19,619
The claybourne estate is
up there in the mountains...

195
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:23,623
sugarcane fields,
mango, ugli fruit

196
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:26,392
as far as the eye can see.

197
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:27,659
What's going on up there?

198
00:16:27,661 --> 00:16:30,028
Oh, they are burning
the sugarcane

199
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,130
to bring in the harvest.
Uh-huh.

200
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,265
It's a seasonal thing,
you know.

201
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:39,670
Hey, that's my father up there.

202
00:16:39,672 --> 00:16:41,271
Do you mind if I say hello?

203
00:16:41,273 --> 00:16:42,338
No.

204
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,273
Go ahead.

205
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:03,954
Jenny: Help... Me.

206
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:36,685
Oh...

207
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:38,319
I'm sorry. You all right?

208
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:39,586
I'm... I'm... I'm great.

209
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:41,138
It's really hot.

210
00:17:41,139 --> 00:17:42,689
I shouldn't have stopped
so close to the fire.

211
00:17:42,691 --> 00:17:46,359
Oh, no, no. No problem.

212
00:17:46,361 --> 00:17:48,461
You know, my father's like you, you know.
He's a doctor.

213
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:49,762
Oh. Really?

214
00:17:49,764 --> 00:17:52,064
Um, what school did he go to?

215
00:17:52,066 --> 00:17:53,598
No school.

216
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,166
He's originally from Haiti.

217
00:17:55,168 --> 00:17:56,767
He's what you call a houngan...

218
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:59,402
a kind of voodoo priest,
a healer.

219
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:01,771
Yeah, I want the full amount
wired to Luxembourg.

220
00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:03,773
Yeah, I know I agreed
to pay you and the others

221
00:18:03,775 --> 00:18:05,174
from the escrow account.

222
00:18:05,176 --> 00:18:07,209
I just think this is
much cleaner and safer.

223
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,511
Yeah...
I'll call you right back.

224
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:11,746
I have somebody
I want you to meet.

225
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:13,013
Dr. Alice dodgson.

226
00:18:13,015 --> 00:18:14,381
Pleased to meet you.
Paul claybourne.

227
00:18:14,383 --> 00:18:16,049
Well, welcome to wonderland,
Alice.

228
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:17,217
Come in. Thank you.

229
00:18:17,218 --> 00:18:18,384
J.B., could you get violette
to get us

230
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:20,052
something cold to drink, please?
Yeah, man.

231
00:18:20,054 --> 00:18:21,787
Let's step out onto the terrace.
Violette...

232
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:24,055
It's, uh... Mr. Paul would
like you to bring him

233
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:25,790
much cooler out there. And the
doctor something cool to drink.

234
00:18:25,792 --> 00:18:29,226
So, Dr. Javitz told me that
you're a wonderful doctor,

235
00:18:29,228 --> 00:18:32,095
says that you're
quite a fighter.

236
00:18:33,598 --> 00:18:35,464
You never give up on a patient.

237
00:18:35,466 --> 00:18:37,766
He also told you I had
my license suspended.

238
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:41,136
Well, any doctor who would take a job so I'm
gonna need a release from you stating...

239
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:44,639
In this godforsaken place
has to have<i> some</i> problems.

240
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:46,641
Dr. Javitz also told me
what happened.

241
00:18:46,643 --> 00:18:50,044
And I have to say
I really admire you.

242
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,246
I just hope you can help
my brother.

243
00:18:52,248 --> 00:18:55,415
You see, he's the, uh,
only family that I have left.

244
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,617
I love him very much.
Thank you.

245
00:18:57,619 --> 00:18:59,452
Violette, this is Dr. Dodgson.

246
00:18:59,454 --> 00:19:02,321
Hello. She'll be staying
with us for a while.

247
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:04,056
Thank you, dear.

248
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:06,091
Violette and Ramon here...

249
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:07,692
they've been with us forever.

250
00:19:07,694 --> 00:19:10,194
They're... they're
really like family.

251
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:12,763
They practically raised
Wesley and I.

252
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:16,800
So if there's anything you
need, just, uh, just ask.

253
00:19:18,637 --> 00:19:20,069
Mr. Claybourne...

254
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:21,737
If your brother
has encephalitis,

255
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:23,605
there's not much
I can do for him

256
00:19:23,607 --> 00:19:25,707
except monitor his condition and
put him on a healthy regimen.

257
00:19:25,709 --> 00:19:27,275
That's not gonna be easy.

258
00:19:27,277 --> 00:19:29,810
You see, encephalitis is just
part of the problem.

259
00:19:29,812 --> 00:19:31,311
What's the other part?

260
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:33,313
He has, um, he has
brain seizures and...

261
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:35,114
oh, well, that's not uncommon

262
00:19:35,116 --> 00:19:37,082
for someone with encephalitis.
You don't understand.

263
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:40,085
What makes the medical problem
difficult is...

264
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:44,855
This is gonna sound strange.

265
00:19:44,857 --> 00:19:48,091
My brother, uh...

266
00:19:48,093 --> 00:19:51,127
He thinks that, uh,
he's a zombie.

267
00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:52,695
Well, not really a zombie.

268
00:19:52,697 --> 00:19:55,230
He thinks someone is
messing with his mind.

269
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,569
Hi.

270
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:45,337
Oh. Hi.

271
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:47,472
I'm sorry.

272
00:20:47,474 --> 00:20:48,673
Dr. Dodgson...

273
00:20:48,675 --> 00:20:49,974
I'm caro. Uh-huh.

274
00:20:49,976 --> 00:20:51,976
Paul thought
maybe I could help you.

275
00:20:51,978 --> 00:20:53,978
I used to help Dr. Winsvold.

276
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,512
Minor stuff. Actually...

277
00:20:55,514 --> 00:20:57,480
Maybe you could help me
with something here.

278
00:20:57,482 --> 00:20:59,648
I'm just going through
Wesley's medical records,

279
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,616
just trying to
get up to speed here and...

280
00:21:01,618 --> 00:21:03,985
And I get data up to
three months ago.

281
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:06,020
After that date, nothing...
which makes no sense.

282
00:21:06,022 --> 00:21:08,206
That's strange.

283
00:21:08,207 --> 00:21:10,391
When did Dr. Winsvold leave?
Two months ago, right?

284
00:21:10,393 --> 00:21:12,760
So there's a one-month gap
in the data.

285
00:21:12,762 --> 00:21:14,695
Uh, he didn't leave. He died.

286
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:17,697
He what?

287
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:19,265
Didn't Paul...

288
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:23,501
Oh, maybe I shouldn't...

289
00:21:23,503 --> 00:21:25,436
No. No, maybe
I misunderstood him.

290
00:21:25,438 --> 00:21:26,670
What did he die of?

291
00:21:26,672 --> 00:21:28,972
I think it was a heart attack.

292
00:21:28,974 --> 00:21:32,909
Mr. Hope... friend of Paul...
used to be a doctor.

293
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:35,711
He came and examined the body.

294
00:21:35,713 --> 00:21:39,347
I think he said it was
a heart attack.

295
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:45,618
You're very pretty.

296
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,386
Hmm?

297
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:48,720
Would you model for me?

298
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:49,921
I'm sorry... what?

299
00:21:49,923 --> 00:21:51,923
Do you want to model for me?

300
00:21:51,925 --> 00:21:53,391
I sculpt.

301
00:21:53,393 --> 00:21:54,792
Oh.

302
00:21:54,794 --> 00:21:56,627
If you have some time.

303
00:21:56,629 --> 00:21:59,997
So, when are you going to
go see Wesley?

304
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:01,565
Tomorrow morning.

305
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:04,601
I can go with you,
if you'd like.

306
00:22:04,603 --> 00:22:06,436
He's a little funny at first,

307
00:22:06,438 --> 00:22:08,905
but I get along with him.

308
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:10,006
He's great.

309
00:22:10,008 --> 00:22:12,908
Wesley was a great musician.

310
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:16,044
And he is so funny.

311
00:22:16,046 --> 00:22:18,479
You sound like
you're in love with him.

312
00:22:19,415 --> 00:22:21,481
<i>Everybody</i> is in love with him.

313
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,092
Come, master. Get in the car.

314
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:50,861
Aah!

315
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,429
You see what I'm talking about?

316
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,596
Where is he going?

317
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,181
I don't know.

318
00:23:55,182 --> 00:23:56,765
I ask him,
but he won't tell me.

319
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:01,769
Can I get you something?
Perhaps a nightcap?

320
00:24:01,771 --> 00:24:03,036
Oh, no, thanks.

321
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:04,737
I'm just gonna get
a good night's sleep,

322
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:06,004
focus on the challenge.

323
00:24:06,006 --> 00:24:07,438
Well, that it is.

324
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,640
But I feel you're up for it.

325
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:11,808
Night, Alice.

326
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,809
Good night.

327
00:24:12,811 --> 00:24:14,610
Sleep tight. Okay.

328
00:24:14,612 --> 00:24:16,511
If you change your mind
about that nightcap...

329
00:24:16,513 --> 00:24:17,512
Aah!

330
00:24:53,049 --> 00:24:54,715
Caro: Dr. Dodgson...

331
00:24:54,717 --> 00:24:56,550
Doctor, are you okay?

332
00:25:04,725 --> 00:25:06,057
Ahhhhhh!

333
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:07,725
Aah! Aah!

334
00:25:07,727 --> 00:25:09,593
Oh! Aah!

335
00:25:09,595 --> 00:25:10,760
Aah!

336
00:25:58,804 --> 00:26:00,637
Caro: Comin'.

337
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,672
Comin'!

338
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,009
Hi.

339
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:09,543
Good morning.

340
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:12,878
Hi, um, uh...

341
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,113
I'm sorry if I woke...
did I wake you up?

342
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,747
No, I'll be ready in a minute.

343
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:19,282
You know, um, I...
I can go by myself.

344
00:26:19,284 --> 00:26:21,617
And, you know, it's quite nice.

345
00:26:21,619 --> 00:26:24,519
I can just, you know,
kind of wander around.

346
00:26:24,521 --> 00:26:26,521
W-whatever.

347
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:27,788
Um... Come on, girl.

348
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,956
I'll put on some coffee.

349
00:26:29,958 --> 00:26:31,924
Um...

350
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:40,063
Wow, you're really...
really good.

351
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:41,230
Yeah?

352
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:43,532
Yeah.

353
00:26:43,534 --> 00:26:45,166
I don't sell much.

354
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:49,103
Well, uh, you know, if I had money, I'd...
I'd buy one.

355
00:26:49,105 --> 00:26:51,872
You're a doctor,
and you're not rich?

356
00:26:51,874 --> 00:26:53,907
That's right.

357
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:57,810
Girl, we both got to get
serious about gettin' rich...

358
00:26:57,812 --> 00:26:59,278
While we're still young
and beautiful.

359
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,565
So, listen...

360
00:27:02,566 --> 00:27:05,851
Last night I... I found
something in my shower.

361
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:07,819
A mongoose?

362
00:27:07,821 --> 00:27:09,654
Oh, they're all over the place.

363
00:27:11,224 --> 00:27:13,324
No, not a mongoose. Uh...

364
00:27:13,326 --> 00:27:16,694
It was a doll with
rusty nails stuck in it.

365
00:27:16,696 --> 00:27:18,880
Somebody put obeah on you.

366
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:21,065
But don't worry, it only work
if you believe it does.

367
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:23,834
What's obeah?

368
00:27:23,836 --> 00:27:25,836
Obeah. It's voodoo.

369
00:27:25,838 --> 00:27:27,070
Jamaican version.

370
00:27:27,072 --> 00:27:28,971
If you don't take it
too seriously,

371
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:29,972
it's like disco.

372
00:27:29,974 --> 00:27:31,907
Voodoo is like disco?

373
00:27:31,909 --> 00:27:34,609
Yeah, you know, you dance hard,

374
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,277
you drink a lot of rum,

375
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,811
smoke some ganja.

376
00:27:37,813 --> 00:27:39,779
Your head goes
to a different place.

377
00:27:39,781 --> 00:27:42,681
You feel sexy and fun...

378
00:27:42,683 --> 00:27:43,748
Really, really loose.

379
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:50,987
So, the airlines lost
your luggage.

380
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,690
My luggage? No.

381
00:27:54,692 --> 00:27:56,091
Oh, because of
what I'm wearing?

382
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:58,293
Oh, no, this isn't what
I was wearing yesterday.

383
00:27:58,295 --> 00:28:01,129
I mean, it looks like what I was
wearing 'cause I have multiples

384
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:02,964
just, you know,
to keep things simple.

385
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:04,065
It's just a fresh pair.

386
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:05,733
Really? It's like a uniform.

387
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,838
So, you're gonna let me lend you
a dress for dinner tonight?

388
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,905
A dress?

389
00:28:20,915 --> 00:28:22,848
Doctor...

390
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,883
Wesley lives there.

391
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:27,151
Maybe I should go first,

392
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:29,186
just to get him ready.

393
00:28:29,188 --> 00:28:30,754
Is that okay?

394
00:28:30,756 --> 00:28:32,689
Yeah. All right.

395
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:38,394
Wesley?

396
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,082
Doctor...

397
00:29:09,824 --> 00:29:11,056
Rough night.

398
00:29:11,058 --> 00:29:12,957
Wesley, come on.

399
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,392
Wesley.

400
00:29:20,932 --> 00:29:21,964
Hi.

401
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:23,365
Dr. Alice dodgson.

402
00:29:25,001 --> 00:29:27,868
You know, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

403
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:30,337
I don't need a doctor.

404
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:32,872
Oh, I'm sorry.
Does my breath smell awful?

405
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,307
I've smelled worse.

406
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:38,443
So, how are you doing
this morning?

407
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:40,879
Wow...

408
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,314
So young and already so deep
into the medical bull...

409
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:46,416
If I felt great,

410
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:48,886
why would my brother drag you
all the way out here?

411
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:50,053
Just so...

412
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:51,055
Uh...

413
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,122
Sit down. Sit down.

414
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,527
You know, I hate to sound like those
doctors that you're so fond of,

415
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:02,295
but drinking
and lymphocytosis...

416
00:30:02,297 --> 00:30:04,063
pretty bad mix.

417
00:30:04,065 --> 00:30:06,465
What makes you think
that I have lymphocytosis?

418
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:09,385
Your medical records.

419
00:30:09,386 --> 00:30:12,304
Actually, my medical records
say "atypical lymphocytosis."

420
00:30:12,306 --> 00:30:14,156
Atypical, as in,

421
00:30:14,157 --> 00:30:16,007
"we don't know what the...
We're talking about."

422
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:18,275
So, if you don't mind, I'm gonna
take your blood pressure,

423
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:19,909
listen to your heart and lungs.

424
00:30:19,911 --> 00:30:21,377
Open your shirt.

425
00:30:23,047 --> 00:30:26,014
Wow, looks like I got myself
my own polidori.

426
00:30:26,016 --> 00:30:28,049
What's a polidori?

427
00:30:28,051 --> 00:30:29,417
Byron's polidori?

428
00:30:30,887 --> 00:30:32,019
Give me a big breath.

429
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:33,704
I-I'm impressed.

430
00:30:33,705 --> 00:30:35,388
I've never met a doctor
who reads poetry.

431
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:36,456
Who's Byron?

432
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,990
What's a polidori?

433
00:30:37,992 --> 00:30:38,991
Big breath.

434
00:30:40,461 --> 00:30:43,094
Byron the poet had a personal
physician named polidori.

435
00:30:43,096 --> 00:30:46,130
Did you know that polidori
had a big crush on Byron?

436
00:30:46,132 --> 00:30:48,031
Byron was a batty boy.
A really big crush.

437
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:52,134
All right, um, roll up
your shirt sleeve, please.

438
00:30:52,136 --> 00:30:55,003
I'm gonna take your blood
pressure, take some blood.

439
00:30:55,005 --> 00:30:56,838
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No blood.

440
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,140
Sorry, I'm sick of you
doctors sucking my blood.

441
00:30:59,142 --> 00:31:01,059
You see, what I have,

442
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,977
there is nothing that
you can do anything about.

443
00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:04,912
What is it that
you think you have?

444
00:31:07,049 --> 00:31:08,314
You wouldn't understand.

445
00:31:08,316 --> 00:31:09,982
If I'm gonna be able
to help you at all...

446
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:12,985
This is over.
It's over, I said!

447
00:31:22,028 --> 00:31:23,127
I'm sorry.

448
00:31:23,129 --> 00:31:24,595
It's just nothing has worked.

449
00:31:24,597 --> 00:31:27,064
Does he really think
he's a zombie?

450
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:30,100
I mean, that's bizarre.
He seems like a smart guy.

451
00:31:30,102 --> 00:31:32,168
Oh, and where does he go
at night?

452
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:35,237
What, you don't want
to tell me?

453
00:31:35,239 --> 00:31:38,373
No, it's not that.

454
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,875
I know it's obeah-related.

455
00:31:40,877 --> 00:31:42,209
How can I help him if...

456
00:31:42,211 --> 00:31:44,144
I just don't know
exactly what he does.

457
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:47,947
Okay, um, do you know
where I can find j.B.?

458
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,900
Alice: As a voodoo priest,

459
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:54,218
could your father turn
someone into a zombie?

460
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,886
My father...

461
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:58,922
I don't know if he'll talk
to you about such things.

462
00:31:58,924 --> 00:32:01,090
I'm asking just so
I can understand, you know,

463
00:32:01,092 --> 00:32:03,225
what Wesley considers
to be his problem.

464
00:32:03,227 --> 00:32:04,492
How is it defined?

465
00:32:04,494 --> 00:32:06,961
What are the symptoms
of that state?

466
00:32:06,963 --> 00:32:09,029
It's a sickness of the soul.

467
00:32:09,031 --> 00:32:10,997
If someone's soul is sick,

468
00:32:10,999 --> 00:32:14,166
do you know which
medicines to give him?

469
00:32:14,168 --> 00:32:16,902
No, I don't do souls.

470
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,283
What you look for?
My sunglasses.

471
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:36,085
I thought maybe I left them
here yesterday.

472
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:47,028
Y-you're not going to tell, no?

473
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,063
Can you drive? Yeah, man.

474
00:32:49,065 --> 00:32:51,198
I am fine.

475
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,066
Actually...

476
00:32:53,068 --> 00:32:54,700
Very fine.

477
00:32:58,939 --> 00:33:01,105
W-w-w-wait. Back up.

478
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,645
Wha...

479
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:12,514
there's a man in that tree.

480
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:14,048
It's a ceremony.

481
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,083
Like communing with nature.

482
00:33:16,085 --> 00:33:19,052
It's like getting your head
to stop thinking so much

483
00:33:19,054 --> 00:33:21,054
so you can see more clear.

484
00:33:42,274 --> 00:33:43,739
Lord, it's hot, eh?

485
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:08,122
J.B., what's wrong?

486
00:34:12,226 --> 00:34:14,459
What are you...

487
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:17,395
j.B.!

488
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:24,167
What wrong with you?!

489
00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:25,501
Oh, my God!

490
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:39,079
What the hell's wrong with you?

491
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:41,247
Oh, you gotta stop smoking
that stuff.

492
00:34:41,249 --> 00:34:43,749
Move over. I'm driving.

493
00:34:57,196 --> 00:35:00,030
J.B., these people
need a doctor.

494
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:02,732
So, if your father
would like, I could, uh...

495
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:05,534
I could come up here
two or three times a week.

496
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,519
What you talk about?
He is a doctor.

497
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,503
Why you think all these people come
here to see him? I didn't mean...

498
00:35:09,506 --> 00:35:11,305
he's healed many people,
you know?

499
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:13,707
Just wait over here
by the worship house.

500
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:14,708
Where?

501
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,277
Here.

502
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:18,811
What's wrong with this guy?

503
00:35:18,813 --> 00:35:21,346
His relatives think
an obeah priest

504
00:35:21,348 --> 00:35:24,115
blow dust, poison, 'pon him,
make him a zombie.

505
00:35:24,117 --> 00:35:25,449
Why the shackles?

506
00:35:25,451 --> 00:35:28,051
So he don't go to work
for the obeah priest.

507
00:35:28,053 --> 00:35:29,352
Soon come.

508
00:35:29,354 --> 00:35:31,587
O...

509
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:33,755
Okay.

510
00:35:48,837 --> 00:35:50,069
Hi.

511
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:51,837
Respect.

512
00:36:21,167 --> 00:36:24,134
Oh. Thank you for taking the time...
two minutes.

513
00:36:24,136 --> 00:36:26,803
I've got people waiting.
I understand.

514
00:36:26,805 --> 00:36:28,271
I wanted to ask your advice.

515
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:29,839
I have a patient who...

516
00:36:29,841 --> 00:36:32,875
who thinks someone's
made him a zombie.

517
00:36:32,877 --> 00:36:34,610
Wesley?

518
00:36:34,612 --> 00:36:35,844
Yes.

519
00:36:35,846 --> 00:36:38,546
There is nothing I can do
to help him.

520
00:36:38,548 --> 00:36:40,714
The obeah man doing it to him

521
00:36:40,716 --> 00:36:43,650
is bigger than me.

522
00:36:43,652 --> 00:36:45,818
Bigger than you?

523
00:36:47,855 --> 00:36:51,356
Can you please put me in touch
with this bigger man?

524
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:52,790
No.

525
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:55,726
Is he trying to harm Wesley?

526
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,399
Look...

527
00:37:03,401 --> 00:37:05,200
oh, my God! Oh, my God!

528
00:37:05,202 --> 00:37:06,834
Aah! No!

529
00:37:08,838 --> 00:37:10,237
No! No, no, no!

530
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:12,706
No, no!

531
00:37:12,708 --> 00:37:14,140
What's wrong?

532
00:37:14,142 --> 00:37:16,775
His heart is racing.
Is he epileptic?

533
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:18,777
D-does he need medicine?

534
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:21,446
Medicines won't do
no good. Papa, okay.

535
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:22,613
Okay. Okay.

536
00:38:00,814 --> 00:38:02,613
Caro: Look at ya!

537
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:04,181
Oh, my God!

538
00:38:04,183 --> 00:38:05,682
Is it okay?

539
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:10,485
I made a big mistake
lending you that dress!

540
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:14,457
Now everybody will be looking
at you and not at me.

541
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,926
Look at you!
Come on, tell the truth.

542
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:19,728
What? You exercise.

543
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,763
Well, I run, yeah. Really?

544
00:38:21,765 --> 00:38:24,365
Yeah. You can come with me
sometime.

545
00:38:24,367 --> 00:38:27,668
Oh, God. No, girl.
I don't have any sneakers.

546
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,804
Come on, I'll introduce you.

547
00:38:30,806 --> 00:38:32,505
That's Jackson.

548
00:38:32,507 --> 00:38:33,506
Hi.

549
00:38:34,742 --> 00:38:36,341
That's a big guy.

550
00:38:36,343 --> 00:38:37,508
Not so big.

551
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,376
This is Matthew hope,

552
00:38:39,378 --> 00:38:42,812
the smartest, nicest, and
craziest man in all of Jamaica.

553
00:38:42,814 --> 00:38:45,347
This is Wesley's new doctor,
Alice dodgson.

554
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:46,748
Nice to meet you.

555
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,450
Nobody looked like you when
I went to medical school...

556
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,684
Back in the middle ages.

557
00:38:50,686 --> 00:38:51,885
Oh, so you're a doctor?

558
00:38:51,887 --> 00:38:54,687
Was. I mostly do
veterinary work now

559
00:38:54,689 --> 00:38:56,555
and odd bits of research.

560
00:38:56,557 --> 00:38:58,056
Oh, what do you research?

561
00:38:58,058 --> 00:39:00,324
He's a big
poom-poom researcher.

562
00:39:00,326 --> 00:39:01,658
Oh, what's poom-poom?

563
00:39:02,661 --> 00:39:04,694
Such bad class. Thank you.

564
00:39:04,696 --> 00:39:05,995
What's poom-poom?

565
00:39:05,997 --> 00:39:07,964
Come on.

566
00:39:07,965 --> 00:39:09,932
What? Why's everyone laughing?
What's poom-poom?

567
00:39:09,934 --> 00:39:12,100
Ah, poom-poom.

568
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:14,335
Now, this is a question
that deserves an answer.

569
00:39:14,337 --> 00:39:16,503
I don't... no, no, no, no, no.
Hold on a second.

570
00:39:16,505 --> 00:39:18,571
I'm very interested...

571
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:19,605
What is poom-poom?

572
00:39:21,575 --> 00:39:23,575
Oh, you're kidding. No!

573
00:39:23,577 --> 00:39:25,076
You're kidding! Oh!

574
00:39:25,078 --> 00:39:28,379
I didn't get much
opportunity for shop talk.

575
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:35,084
Spider to obeah is as
the snake is to voodoo.

576
00:39:35,086 --> 00:39:36,535
Why spider?

577
00:39:36,536 --> 00:39:37,985
It's the wisest
of all creatures.

578
00:39:37,988 --> 00:39:39,921
No direct conflict
with the prey...

579
00:39:39,923 --> 00:39:42,657
just lays traps, waits,
and then boom!

580
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:45,126
I'm surprised you'd be
interested in it.

581
00:39:45,128 --> 00:39:47,928
Oh, my interest
is purely professional.

582
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,630
I have a patient
who's interested in it.

583
00:39:50,632 --> 00:39:52,098
Poor Wesley.

584
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,100
Is he expected?

585
00:39:54,102 --> 00:39:56,435
Well, Paul was hoping, but...

586
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,637
It's tough on both these boys.

587
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,007
First the mother tragedy,
then Wesley so sick.

588
00:40:02,009 --> 00:40:03,908
You know, I have this
fabulous property in negril.

589
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:04,909
Thank you.

590
00:40:04,911 --> 00:40:06,477
What happened to the mother?

591
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:09,980
Murdered, 20 years ago.
Horrible thing.

592
00:40:09,982 --> 00:40:14,717
Caro's mother, also...
same way, a month earlier.

593
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:15,718
How?

594
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,985
Little chop-chop.

595
00:40:18,121 --> 00:40:19,653
Machete action.

596
00:40:19,655 --> 00:40:21,154
Wesley!

597
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:27,793
Wes!

598
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:30,028
Wesley, you look
so much better.

599
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,829
Thank you.

600
00:40:31,831 --> 00:40:32,996
Come on.
Your seat's all ready for you.

601
00:40:32,998 --> 00:40:35,532
Oh, that's great.

602
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:38,067
Uh, but, uh, maybe I should
sit next to the doctor...

603
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:40,169
just, uh... just in case I need

604
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,704
some sudden medical attention.

605
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:46,007
As you wish.

606
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:47,541
Ah.

607
00:40:47,543 --> 00:40:50,477
Oh, Wesley!

608
00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:51,744
It's so wonderful

609
00:40:51,746 --> 00:40:54,646
to see you back
at the dinner table again.

610
00:40:54,648 --> 00:40:55,980
I missed your cooking.

611
00:40:55,982 --> 00:40:58,115
Sit down, sit down.

612
00:40:58,117 --> 00:41:00,984
So sick of that crap
those doctors made me eat.

613
00:41:04,788 --> 00:41:07,421
The smell makes me feel
better already.

614
00:41:12,927 --> 00:41:15,994
So, polidori,
how do you like Jamaica?

615
00:41:15,996 --> 00:41:19,597
I like Jamaica very much,
your lordship.

616
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,433
Every day
I learn something new.

617
00:41:22,435 --> 00:41:24,635
What did you learn today,
polidori?

618
00:41:24,637 --> 00:41:26,770
Today I learned
what poom-poom is.

619
00:41:27,773 --> 00:41:30,740
A napkin, your lordship?

620
00:42:02,702 --> 00:42:04,101
Woman: Goodness!

621
00:42:04,103 --> 00:42:07,003
Woman?2: Oh, yay!

622
00:42:09,107 --> 00:42:11,907
Whatever you're doing
for him, it's working.

623
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:15,110
I haven't seen him like this
in over a year.

624
00:42:15,112 --> 00:42:16,511
Alice: Oh, it's not me.

625
00:42:16,513 --> 00:42:18,145
I haven't done anything yet...

626
00:42:18,147 --> 00:42:20,247
But I will.

627
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:21,848
Caro: Come on, Wesley!

628
00:43:02,218 --> 00:43:04,718
Does anybody want to dance
with me?

629
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,785
Whoo!

630
00:43:11,759 --> 00:43:13,125
Whoo!

631
00:43:13,127 --> 00:43:14,159
Yeah, baby!

632
00:43:14,161 --> 00:43:15,660
Come on, baby!

633
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:21,765
Scott: Here we go, now!

634
00:43:21,767 --> 00:43:23,233
Come on, now!

635
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:25,768
Once the estate sells,

636
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,136
the brown bitch
will be hocking her wares

637
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:29,838
on the street,
where she belongs.

638
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,806
I love it!

639
00:43:31,808 --> 00:43:33,274
Don't you find her repulsive?

640
00:43:33,276 --> 00:43:36,844
Actually, no.
I think she's a great girl.

641
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:40,280
Did you just say Paul
is selling the estate?

642
00:43:46,087 --> 00:43:48,287
Get your hands off my girl!
Cut it out!

643
00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:49,855
What?

644
00:43:49,857 --> 00:43:50,922
Come here!

645
00:43:50,924 --> 00:43:51,822
Easy, man!

646
00:43:51,824 --> 00:43:53,757
Let him go!

647
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:55,759
Hey, stop that!

648
00:43:57,696 --> 00:43:59,095
Don't you have any shame?!

649
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:03,766
Paul: Thank you for coming.
Good to see you.

650
00:44:03,768 --> 00:44:06,101
Caro: Fabulous.
Scott: I mean, I just...

651
00:44:06,103 --> 00:44:08,103
good night, Paul. Good night.

652
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:10,672
No, no, I am not...
Jackie: Stop it!

653
00:44:10,674 --> 00:44:13,608
I want you to go right to bed.
Stop it!

654
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,142
Yours or mine?

655
00:44:15,144 --> 00:44:17,878
Man: Shut up! Man?2:
Loosen up for once!

656
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:21,113
I'm serious.

657
00:44:21,115 --> 00:44:23,315
I want you to go
straight to bed.

658
00:44:23,317 --> 00:44:27,085
Your doctor is dead set
on getting you better.

659
00:44:27,087 --> 00:44:30,888
You know, there are all kinds
of ways of getting better.

660
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,322
I think doctors need to be open

661
00:44:32,324 --> 00:44:34,624
to all kinds of treatments.

662
00:44:34,626 --> 00:44:37,259
So should patients.

663
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:39,694
Go to sleep.

664
00:44:41,164 --> 00:44:42,263
Good night.

665
00:44:45,101 --> 00:44:49,703
I cannot believe you were prancing
around with that little native slut.

666
00:44:49,705 --> 00:44:51,304
Do you know how revolting
you looked?

667
00:44:51,306 --> 00:44:53,973
I don't know why Paul even allows
her to live on the estate.

668
00:44:53,975 --> 00:44:56,875
Or maybe he's doing her, too. You
know, I wouldn't be surprised.

669
00:44:56,877 --> 00:45:00,044
I heard the guy fathered a child
with one of his own servant girls.

670
00:45:00,046 --> 00:45:02,279
It was just disgusting.

671
00:45:02,281 --> 00:45:05,982
Don't you dare raise the volume on me!
You're being so rude!

672
00:45:07,785 --> 00:45:09,618
Aaaaah!

673
00:45:11,288 --> 00:45:14,856
What the hell was that?

674
00:45:14,858 --> 00:45:15,957
I'll check.

675
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:26,232
Beautiful.

676
00:45:26,234 --> 00:45:29,835
It's a flat tire.

677
00:45:29,837 --> 00:45:32,971
Pop the trunk.

678
00:45:34,407 --> 00:45:37,641
Is this gonna take long?

679
00:45:37,643 --> 00:45:39,275
It's a little creepy out here.

680
00:45:42,913 --> 00:45:44,111
Scott?

681
00:45:47,216 --> 00:45:49,249
Scott?

682
00:45:52,687 --> 00:45:55,354
Scott? I want to go home.

683
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:37,760
Wesley! Open up!

684
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:41,764
Man: Alice.

685
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:55,042
Alice.

686
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,416
Wesley, are you in there?

687
00:47:19,831 --> 00:47:21,497
Wesley?

688
00:47:21,499 --> 00:47:25,534
Let me help you.

689
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:34,007
Aah!

690
00:47:35,043 --> 00:47:37,327
Wait.

691
00:47:37,328 --> 00:47:39,612
I only wanted to talk to you
without them knowing.

692
00:47:39,614 --> 00:47:41,614
Them? Who is "them," j.B.?

693
00:47:41,616 --> 00:47:42,948
The bigger man?

694
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:45,050
If I tell you, I dead.

695
00:47:45,052 --> 00:47:47,452
Please, for your own sake,
just leave the place tonight.

696
00:47:47,454 --> 00:47:48,986
Just run.

697
00:47:48,988 --> 00:47:51,388
They are more powerful
than anything, anyone.

698
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:53,890
They make you sick physically.

699
00:47:53,892 --> 00:47:56,525
When I catch fever,
when your resistance is gone,

700
00:47:56,527 --> 00:47:59,461
t-t-they get inside
your mind, your brain.

701
00:47:59,463 --> 00:48:02,964
You get these visions.
They're scary, very real.

702
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:06,867
Now they give me
the same dumb mirage sickness.

703
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:10,537
J.B., I am not big on
running away from anything.

704
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:14,173
I will go at this until
I figure it out, okay...

705
00:48:14,175 --> 00:48:17,075
j.B.?

706
00:48:24,283 --> 00:48:26,182
Alice: Caro, are you asleep?

707
00:48:26,184 --> 00:48:27,483
Comin'!

708
00:48:27,485 --> 00:48:29,284
Comin'!

709
00:48:39,095 --> 00:48:41,328
Ay!

710
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,529
Oh.

711
00:48:42,531 --> 00:48:43,930
Hi.

712
00:48:43,932 --> 00:48:45,131
Hi.

713
00:48:45,133 --> 00:48:46,332
I just wanted to thank you

714
00:48:46,334 --> 00:48:48,534
for lending me the dress
and the shoes.

715
00:48:48,536 --> 00:48:50,569
What are those for?
Well, they're...

716
00:48:50,571 --> 00:48:53,104
I thought maybe you'd want
to go running,

717
00:48:53,106 --> 00:48:55,172
but, uh, I see you're busy.

718
00:48:55,174 --> 00:48:57,073
Busy?

719
00:48:57,075 --> 00:48:59,908
Men... no stamina.

720
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,515
We grew up together...
Paul, Wesley, j.B., and me.

721
00:49:07,517 --> 00:49:09,183
Oh.

722
00:49:09,185 --> 00:49:10,384
Violette used to take us

723
00:49:10,386 --> 00:49:13,420
up to Julian's, j.B.'S father,
on Sundays.

724
00:49:13,422 --> 00:49:15,555
I heard about your mother.

725
00:49:15,557 --> 00:49:18,524
My mother?
And Wesley and Paul's.

726
00:49:18,526 --> 00:49:22,461
That must have been very
difficult for all of you.

727
00:49:22,463 --> 00:49:24,596
Yeah. My poor mother.

728
00:49:24,598 --> 00:49:27,131
She was Haitian, you know.

729
00:49:27,133 --> 00:49:31,301
She came here
with all the others in 1962.

730
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:32,702
What others?

731
00:49:32,704 --> 00:49:36,706
Oh, Julian, Ramon, violette,

732
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:40,409
Mr. Claybourne's little Haitian
mafia. Very clever.

733
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:42,711
Wait, Alice.

734
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:48,149
That was the same year
Jamaica got its independence.

735
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:52,319
All the British landowners
freaked out...

736
00:49:52,321 --> 00:49:54,421
thought there would be riots,

737
00:49:54,423 --> 00:49:56,456
that the land
would be taken over.

738
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:58,391
So Mr. Claybourne came

739
00:49:58,393 --> 00:50:02,194
and bought the estate
for almost nothing.

740
00:50:02,196 --> 00:50:04,229
Thought he could scare
the locals

741
00:50:04,231 --> 00:50:06,164
with voodoo crossed with obeah.

742
00:50:06,166 --> 00:50:08,466
Ramon mess up their bodies,

743
00:50:08,468 --> 00:50:10,501
and Julian mess up their souls.

744
00:50:10,503 --> 00:50:12,603
Worked great for him.

745
00:50:15,007 --> 00:50:16,272
Maybe we should get going.

746
00:50:16,274 --> 00:50:18,641
Who's this guy?

747
00:50:18,643 --> 00:50:20,375
I thought I knew everybody
who owned a bike.

748
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:25,279
Oh!

749
00:50:25,281 --> 00:50:28,482
What's wrong with you, man?!
Are you crazy?!

750
00:50:30,419 --> 00:50:33,720
Oh, my. Oh!

751
00:50:33,722 --> 00:50:35,755
C-come on. Let's run.

752
00:50:35,757 --> 00:50:37,656
Oh, my God.

753
00:50:37,658 --> 00:50:40,725
So, about the two killings...

754
00:50:40,727 --> 00:50:43,260
did they ever find out
who did it?

755
00:50:43,262 --> 00:50:45,161
Nobody knows who did it.

756
00:50:45,163 --> 00:50:48,030
Or maybe they do,
and they hushed it up.

757
00:50:48,032 --> 00:50:51,099
Rich men can get away with,
well, you know.

758
00:50:51,101 --> 00:50:52,433
So you think Mr. Claybourne?

759
00:50:52,435 --> 00:50:55,002
Me don't know.
He was a strange... Alice!

760
00:50:56,138 --> 00:50:57,170
Ow!

761
00:50:57,172 --> 00:50:59,272
Are you okay? Oh, my God!

762
00:50:59,274 --> 00:51:00,506
What?

763
00:51:00,508 --> 00:51:02,241
Aaah!

764
00:51:19,658 --> 00:51:22,158
Superintendent: Have you checked
on Wesley this morning?

765
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,143
No, not... not yet.

766
00:51:24,144 --> 00:51:26,127
What does... what does that
have to do with anything?

767
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:28,697
Isn't it customary for a doctor
to check on their patient

768
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:30,432
first thing in the morning?

769
00:51:30,434 --> 00:51:32,400
Customary? No.

770
00:51:32,402 --> 00:51:34,468
No, Wesley likes to sleep late.

771
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:37,170
He needs his sleep.
Why would I wake him?

772
00:51:37,172 --> 00:51:39,772
If him wake up late, that
mean him go to sleep late...

773
00:51:39,774 --> 00:51:42,174
Very late.
Jackson: Let me go, man!

774
00:51:42,176 --> 00:51:44,409
Let me go, man! Superintendent:
Look who's here

775
00:51:44,411 --> 00:51:47,445
with all kinds of
interesting scratches on.

776
00:51:47,447 --> 00:51:48,896
Me not do nothin'!

777
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,346
That's exactly what
you said two months ago

778
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:52,649
when that other young lady
was found dead here.

779
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,618
What other young lady
was found dead?

780
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,052
Superintendent...

781
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,354
Those scratches... That's me.

782
00:52:00,356 --> 00:52:04,358
It must have been
a very special night.

783
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,594
I can practically hear
the moaning.

784
00:52:07,596 --> 00:52:12,364
What other young lady
was found dead here?

785
00:52:18,305 --> 00:52:19,437
Al...

786
00:52:21,674 --> 00:52:23,774
look, please don't leave.
I can explain everything.

787
00:52:23,776 --> 00:52:26,309
Explain? You never tell me
that the doctor before me

788
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:28,294
supposedly dies
of a heart attack.

789
00:52:28,295 --> 00:52:30,278
You never tell me that a woman
is found slashed to ribbons

790
00:52:30,281 --> 00:52:32,248
on the premises
that very same night.

791
00:52:32,249 --> 00:52:34,216
Alice... You never tell me that
the police consider my patient

792
00:52:34,218 --> 00:52:36,117
to be a possible
homicidal maniac.

793
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,852
You never tell me...
look, Alice...

794
00:52:37,854 --> 00:52:39,687
I apologize, okay?

795
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:41,689
My brother is not a killer.
Oh, really?

796
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:43,657
So you can swear that
he was with you last night,

797
00:52:43,659 --> 00:52:45,392
because I can tell you
one thing for sure

798
00:52:45,394 --> 00:52:46,526
is he was not in his room.

799
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:49,828
What the hell?

800
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:52,230
Oh, yeah. Wait. Wait.

801
00:52:52,232 --> 00:52:53,431
Isn't this nice?

802
00:52:53,433 --> 00:52:56,634
Do you like that?
Do you like that?

803
00:52:56,636 --> 00:52:58,135
Mr. Claybourne, I am done here.

804
00:52:58,137 --> 00:52:59,669
You're gonna have to find
yourself another doctor.

805
00:52:59,671 --> 00:53:01,437
Dr. Dodgson, please.

806
00:53:01,439 --> 00:53:03,806
You see, you don't understand.

807
00:53:03,808 --> 00:53:05,207
Wesley and I,

808
00:53:05,209 --> 00:53:06,374
we spent our entire childhood

809
00:53:06,376 --> 00:53:07,641
in a boarding school
in New York.

810
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:08,742
He's the only family
that I have.

811
00:53:08,744 --> 00:53:10,210
I'm just afraid of losing him.

812
00:53:10,212 --> 00:53:11,644
I should never have
come back here.

813
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,345
This is not a good place.

814
00:53:13,347 --> 00:53:14,779
Wesley: Like hell it's not.

815
00:53:14,781 --> 00:53:17,414
This is a beautiful place.

816
00:53:17,416 --> 00:53:21,551
What our father did to it
is a tragedy.

817
00:53:23,621 --> 00:53:26,455
Wesley, are you all right?

818
00:53:31,594 --> 00:53:33,694
You think that I killed
those people?

819
00:53:33,696 --> 00:53:36,129
Well, where were you
last night after dinner?

820
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:37,396
I don't know.

821
00:53:37,398 --> 00:53:38,897
What do you mean,
you don't know?

822
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,734
I have... These...

823
00:53:43,736 --> 00:53:46,303
I don't know... blackouts.

824
00:53:46,305 --> 00:53:47,871
It's like a fever.

825
00:53:47,873 --> 00:53:49,806
It... it takes me over.

826
00:53:50,742 --> 00:53:53,576
It's like I'm
some kind of zombie.

827
00:53:53,578 --> 00:53:55,962
When we were kids,

828
00:53:55,963 --> 00:53:58,347
we used to go to these
ceremonies up in the hills.

829
00:53:58,349 --> 00:53:59,581
Do you remember?

830
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:01,215
It was really exciting.

831
00:54:01,217 --> 00:54:02,849
I was all under control.

832
00:54:04,886 --> 00:54:07,786
A couple of years ago...

833
00:54:07,788 --> 00:54:09,788
I started to go back.

834
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:11,890
Well...

835
00:54:11,892 --> 00:54:14,259
I wasn't in control anymore.

836
00:54:14,261 --> 00:54:15,660
Then why don't you stop going?

837
00:54:15,662 --> 00:54:17,662
Oh, because I can't.

838
00:54:17,664 --> 00:54:21,365
Paul: Look, doctor, we can
replace anything that you need.

839
00:54:21,367 --> 00:54:23,700
I can have it flown in from
Miami within 48 hours, okay?

840
00:54:23,702 --> 00:54:26,436
I can get you 24-hour security
here on the estate.

841
00:54:26,438 --> 00:54:30,540
We can get you anything you
need, just please, you know,

842
00:54:30,542 --> 00:54:32,775
don't give up on us.

843
00:54:39,949 --> 00:54:43,183
I'm gonna need a sample
of his blood.

844
00:54:43,185 --> 00:54:44,717
Thanks.

845
00:54:47,922 --> 00:54:49,521
Caro: Alice!

846
00:54:49,523 --> 00:54:52,557
So they talked you
into stayin'!

847
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,392
I knew it!

848
00:54:54,394 --> 00:54:57,862
I see the way you look at Wesley
and your poom-poom just take over!

849
00:55:02,367 --> 00:55:03,866
Whoa, slow down, please!

850
00:55:03,868 --> 00:55:05,534
The blood samples!

851
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:07,502
It's him again! Who again?

852
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:10,739
That guy on the bike,
the one from this morning.

853
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:13,408
You know, he could have killed
that real-estate woman.

854
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,376
There is no one there.

855
00:55:15,378 --> 00:55:18,712
I'm not taking any chances.
Hold on!

856
00:55:19,915 --> 00:55:21,014
Caro...

857
00:55:21,016 --> 00:55:23,016
Caro, turn around!

858
00:55:23,018 --> 00:55:24,450
Aah! Aah!

859
00:55:28,355 --> 00:55:30,388
Caro, look up there!

860
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:32,390
Aah! Aah!

861
00:55:43,401 --> 00:55:45,367
Are you hurt?

862
00:55:45,369 --> 00:55:46,968
That guy...

863
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:48,569
What guy?!

864
00:55:48,571 --> 00:55:50,871
There was no guy!

865
00:55:50,873 --> 00:55:53,340
What do you mean,
there was no guy?

866
00:55:53,342 --> 00:55:55,375
Don't start messin'
with my mind, Alice.

867
00:55:55,377 --> 00:55:57,343
I know what I saw! Ow!

868
00:55:58,879 --> 00:56:00,612
You're hallucinating.

869
00:56:00,614 --> 00:56:04,482
I'm sorry,
but I think that you have...

870
00:56:06,352 --> 00:56:09,920
the same thing
that Wesley and j.B. Have.

871
00:56:09,922 --> 00:56:11,821
I don't have anything!

872
00:56:11,823 --> 00:56:14,490
I don't have anything,
and if I did,

873
00:56:14,492 --> 00:56:15,657
I wouldn't want to know
about it!

874
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:18,459
Wesley's... Is incurable,
and if I had it...

875
00:56:18,461 --> 00:56:20,761
which I don't...

876
00:56:20,763 --> 00:56:23,897
It would ruin my day.

877
00:56:23,899 --> 00:56:25,064
I'll be more than happy

878
00:56:25,066 --> 00:56:27,533
to have these analyzed
for you, Dr. Dodgson,

879
00:56:27,535 --> 00:56:29,468
but the day shift
is almost finished.

880
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:31,636
It will have to be done
during the night shift.

881
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,638
I'll have the results
for you tomorrow.

882
00:56:35,742 --> 00:56:36,741
This won't hurt.

883
00:56:36,743 --> 00:56:38,409
Caro has a medical problem,

884
00:56:38,411 --> 00:56:40,811
and I want to make sure
you didn't contract it.

885
00:56:40,813 --> 00:56:44,548
Almost got it. Okay?

886
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:55,157
Man: Dispatch...
come in, dispatch...

887
00:57:19,782 --> 00:57:20,814
So, how are you feeling?

888
00:57:20,816 --> 00:57:21,848
Like swimmin'.

889
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:23,482
We should... come on.

890
00:57:23,484 --> 00:57:25,717
Let's go get Matthew
and Wesley.

891
00:57:25,719 --> 00:57:28,553
You know, I really think
that you should...

892
00:57:28,555 --> 00:57:32,023
what, buy a swimming suit?
I got one right here.

893
00:57:32,025 --> 00:57:35,192
You know, you're really gonna
have to stop being so cool

894
00:57:35,194 --> 00:57:38,428
'cause I'm gonna wind up wanting
to be exactly like you.

895
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:39,729
Oh, God forbid!

896
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:42,765
One of me is more than enough.

897
00:57:42,767 --> 00:57:43,766
Matthew!

898
00:57:43,768 --> 00:57:46,602
We thought we heard voices.

899
00:57:46,604 --> 00:57:49,171
So... Where we all going?

900
00:57:52,108 --> 00:57:55,142
Whoo-hoo!

901
00:57:55,144 --> 00:57:57,177
Aah!

902
00:58:00,815 --> 00:58:02,881
I just... I just don't get it.

903
00:58:02,883 --> 00:58:04,449
What is making
these people sick,

904
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:06,217
and why isn't it
more of an epidemic?

905
00:58:06,219 --> 00:58:08,986
Why is it only people associated
with the claybourne estate?

906
00:58:08,988 --> 00:58:12,723
I, um, you know, I'm not sure.
Caro: Alice, come on in, girl!

907
00:58:12,725 --> 00:58:14,224
Come on!

908
00:58:14,226 --> 00:58:16,960
For the 10th time,
I don't have a suit.

909
00:58:16,962 --> 00:58:18,962
That's no excuse!

910
00:58:18,964 --> 00:58:21,064
There's no one around
except Wesley...

911
00:58:21,066 --> 00:58:24,500
he'll see you naked
sooner or later...

912
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:27,002
and Matthew,
who just might pay $100

913
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,637
to see you take off
them clothes!

914
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:30,971
Absolutely.

915
00:58:30,973 --> 00:58:33,606
$200, if you'll take a check.

916
00:58:33,608 --> 00:58:36,508
Yeah! Whoo!

917
00:58:38,078 --> 00:58:40,645
Yeah!

918
00:58:40,647 --> 00:58:44,048
Make it a certified check.

919
00:58:46,986 --> 00:58:49,186
All right! Come on! Come on!

920
00:59:00,931 --> 00:59:03,197
¶ Give your lovin'
in the mornin', girl ¶

921
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:06,066
¶ give your lovin'
in the evenin', now ¶

922
00:59:06,068 --> 00:59:09,936
¶ give your lovin'
at nighttime, too ¶

923
00:59:28,988 --> 00:59:30,220
Wesley!

924
00:59:36,061 --> 00:59:41,196
Is he in just such complete
denial about his condition?

925
00:59:41,198 --> 00:59:42,764
This is very serious.

926
00:59:42,766 --> 00:59:44,265
He could be dead in six months.

927
00:59:44,267 --> 00:59:46,033
Oh, I could be dead tomorrow.

928
00:59:46,035 --> 00:59:47,518
You could be dead tonight.

929
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:49,002
People here don't think
about that kind of thing.

930
00:59:49,004 --> 00:59:53,206
Drink a little root juice,
smoke a little ganja.

931
00:59:54,609 --> 00:59:56,308
Hey, baby.

932
00:59:58,645 --> 01:00:00,911
Here, have some root juice.

933
01:00:00,913 --> 01:00:02,045
Root juice?

934
01:00:02,047 --> 01:00:03,713
They make it locally.

935
01:00:03,715 --> 01:00:05,114
Two glasses of this,

936
01:00:05,116 --> 01:00:08,617
you'll be purring louder
than Hercules here.

937
01:00:11,688 --> 01:00:13,020
It's good.

938
01:00:13,022 --> 01:00:13,954
Mmm.

939
01:00:16,024 --> 01:00:17,189
Great.

940
01:00:24,731 --> 01:00:26,997
Mr. Jackson,
a lady friend of yours

941
01:00:26,999 --> 01:00:29,799
gave me a substantial
amount of money

942
01:00:29,801 --> 01:00:32,034
for me to turn my back
at the right moment.

943
01:00:32,036 --> 01:00:35,637
I believe she has a car
outside waiting for you.

944
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:38,039
Hit me right here, sir.

945
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:41,275
No, I just had that filling
put in yesterday.

946
01:00:41,277 --> 01:00:44,911
This one.

947
01:00:44,913 --> 01:00:46,879
Come, come.

948
01:00:46,881 --> 01:00:48,280
Come on.

949
01:00:56,155 --> 01:00:58,088
I don't think so!

950
01:01:00,025 --> 01:01:01,924
Wow!

951
01:01:13,067 --> 01:01:15,000
What? What are you looking at?

952
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:26,677
You want to go for a walk?

953
01:01:47,065 --> 01:01:50,266
Hey, you come to give me
a ride?

954
01:01:54,005 --> 01:01:56,205
Mr. Jackson...

955
01:01:56,207 --> 01:01:59,041
Out for a little walk?

956
01:02:32,975 --> 01:02:35,175
This is great.

957
01:02:35,176 --> 01:02:37,376
I can't wait to call home
and say, "guess what.

958
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:40,346
I just... I just, uh,
kissed a zombie."

959
01:02:43,451 --> 01:02:45,451
You know what else?

960
01:02:45,453 --> 01:02:51,256
I've seen people turn into
zombies up in the hills.

961
01:02:51,258 --> 01:02:55,093
They have the dust
blown into their face,

962
01:02:55,095 --> 01:02:56,427
the whole thing.

963
01:02:56,429 --> 01:03:00,063
That's not what's wrong
with me.

964
01:03:00,065 --> 01:03:03,132
I have something different.

965
01:03:03,134 --> 01:03:07,202
I have someone messing
with my mind.

966
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:12,039
Wesley.

967
01:03:12,041 --> 01:03:14,207
Wesley...

968
01:03:14,209 --> 01:03:16,175
Please...

969
01:03:18,078 --> 01:03:19,744
Rats.

970
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:42,729
Aah!

971
01:04:37,947 --> 01:04:38,912
Yah!

972
01:04:43,417 --> 01:04:45,183
Aaaah!

973
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:47,485
Aaaah!

974
01:05:13,878 --> 01:05:16,044
Hi.

975
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:19,246
Yah!

976
01:05:33,527 --> 01:05:36,928
Alice!

977
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:38,129
Alice!

978
01:05:39,065 --> 01:05:41,065
Matthew?

979
01:05:43,269 --> 01:05:47,404
Get my bag out of my desk!

980
01:05:47,406 --> 01:05:50,373
Oh, my God!
This can't be happening!

981
01:05:53,044 --> 01:05:54,243
She's coming out of it.

982
01:05:54,245 --> 01:05:56,511
She's having some kind
of a seizure.

983
01:05:57,514 --> 01:06:00,081
Breathe in.

984
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:01,982
Out. In.

985
01:06:01,984 --> 01:06:04,985
Did anybody else...
Hear the drums?

986
01:06:04,987 --> 01:06:06,987
Drums?

987
01:06:06,989 --> 01:06:10,957
Then I just had the most
horrifyingly real dream

988
01:06:10,959 --> 01:06:13,392
of my life.

989
01:06:15,996 --> 01:06:18,663
I really got to learn to relax.

990
01:06:21,334 --> 01:06:24,034
I got to chill out.

991
01:06:25,337 --> 01:06:26,870
Hold her head! Hold her head!

992
01:06:26,871 --> 01:06:28,404
What's wrong? We've got
to get her to a doctor.

993
01:06:28,406 --> 01:06:31,473
Try and support her.

994
01:06:36,345 --> 01:06:39,012
Go. Watch your step.

995
01:06:40,682 --> 01:06:42,415
Dr. Shaba:
I got the test results.

996
01:06:42,417 --> 01:06:46,485
It's a virus like htlv-1,
but different.

997
01:06:46,487 --> 01:06:48,420
It's a retrovirus...

998
01:06:48,422 --> 01:06:52,323
rna converting into DNA,
but it's been altered.

999
01:06:52,325 --> 01:06:54,658
I've never seen anything
like it.

1000
01:06:57,195 --> 01:06:59,461
Stick me and run a test.

1001
01:06:59,463 --> 01:07:00,662
For what?

1002
01:07:00,664 --> 01:07:03,998
The same virus.

1003
01:07:06,335 --> 01:07:08,201
Matthew: "How's it hanging?"

1004
01:07:08,203 --> 01:07:11,370
That's one trip too many
to Miami.

1005
01:07:11,372 --> 01:07:14,706
L-listen, this is gonna
sound a little weird,

1006
01:07:14,708 --> 01:07:16,507
um, but it's on my mind.

1007
01:07:16,509 --> 01:07:20,177
Um, I was fine, you know,
with everything else,

1008
01:07:20,179 --> 01:07:22,145
but this girl, this doctor,

1009
01:07:22,147 --> 01:07:24,280
Alice, you know,
she's a good person,

1010
01:07:24,282 --> 01:07:26,448
and she has
nothing to do with this...

1011
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:28,383
now, remember...
you know what I mean?

1012
01:07:28,385 --> 01:07:30,251
The deal closes in three days.

1013
01:07:30,253 --> 01:07:32,319
I know. God knows...
we don't want anything

1014
01:07:32,321 --> 01:07:34,554
to get in the way of all
that money, do we?

1015
01:07:34,556 --> 01:07:37,056
Please, if I can just
tell her what she has

1016
01:07:37,058 --> 01:07:38,390
or at least, you know,

1017
01:07:38,392 --> 01:07:41,059
um, nudge her in
the right direction...

1018
01:07:41,061 --> 01:07:42,427
it's a little late

1019
01:07:42,429 --> 01:07:45,229
to be getting self-righteous,
isn't it?

1020
01:07:45,231 --> 01:07:47,798
I'm not being self-righteous,

1021
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:50,734
but even a bastard like myself,

1022
01:07:50,736 --> 01:07:54,404
who has a total disregard
for morality...

1023
01:07:54,406 --> 01:07:57,340
Has to draw the line somewhere.

1024
01:08:07,482 --> 01:08:09,582
Hello. Dr. Shaba.

1025
01:08:10,484 --> 01:08:13,184
Sure. Just a second.

1026
01:08:13,186 --> 01:08:14,718
It's for you.

1027
01:08:16,088 --> 01:08:17,453
For me?

1028
01:08:20,724 --> 01:08:22,256
Yes?

1029
01:08:22,258 --> 01:08:23,657
Hello. It's Matthew.

1030
01:08:23,659 --> 01:08:25,058
Oh. Hi.

1031
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:26,492
I hope you're feeling better.

1032
01:08:26,494 --> 01:08:28,360
I'm waiting for the results.

1033
01:08:28,362 --> 01:08:30,462
Well, listen...
I might have a thought or two

1034
01:08:30,464 --> 01:08:32,430
about the nature
of the, uh, problem...

1035
01:08:32,432 --> 01:08:35,065
the medical problem you're
so concerned about. Really?

1036
01:08:35,067 --> 01:08:37,400
It's just a hunch, but I think
it's worth checking out.

1037
01:08:37,402 --> 01:08:40,703
We're just taking
a little blood sample...

1038
01:08:40,705 --> 01:08:42,722
To help somebody

1039
01:08:42,723 --> 01:08:44,740
who needs to understand
what's happening to her.

1040
01:08:54,116 --> 01:08:55,748
Come in.

1041
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:57,549
I'm in the back.

1042
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:02,753
Alice, I've got something
really interesting to show you.

1043
01:09:05,758 --> 01:09:08,492
You got here a whole lot quicker
than I thought you...

1044
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:12,495
oh. What...
what are you doing here?

1045
01:09:12,497 --> 01:09:16,332
In two days, me going be rich.

1046
01:09:16,334 --> 01:09:19,468
Hmm.

1047
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:21,636
Me don't want anything
going wrong.

1048
01:09:21,638 --> 01:09:23,337
Now, listen, superintendent.

1049
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:25,339
I have a piece
of the action, too,

1050
01:09:25,341 --> 01:09:28,342
and I need the money
just as badly as you do.

1051
01:09:28,344 --> 01:09:30,444
But like I told Paul...

1052
01:09:30,446 --> 01:09:33,180
T-this young girl
can't do us any harm.

1053
01:09:33,182 --> 01:09:36,116
Why do any more damage
than we have... aah!

1054
01:09:36,118 --> 01:09:37,650
Well?

1055
01:09:39,286 --> 01:09:41,653
Positive...
same as you and Jackson.

1056
01:09:41,655 --> 01:09:43,588
You heard about Jackson?

1057
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:45,389
No. What about Jackson?

1058
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:47,591
He was shot and killed.

1059
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:51,260
Matthew?

1060
01:10:00,903 --> 01:10:01,902
Matthew?

1061
01:10:01,904 --> 01:10:03,570
Wesley: Alice! Quick!

1062
01:10:03,572 --> 01:10:05,505
He's dead!

1063
01:10:14,415 --> 01:10:16,681
Wesley: What are
the police doing here?

1064
01:10:16,683 --> 01:10:19,850
Caro: Paul's worried about
safety after the murders.

1065
01:10:22,354 --> 01:10:24,387
Maybe he's worried
about what will happen

1066
01:10:24,389 --> 01:10:26,822
when everybody finds out
they're out of a home and job.

1067
01:10:26,824 --> 01:10:28,390
What?

1068
01:10:28,392 --> 01:10:30,525
Why would people lose
their home and job?

1069
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:32,493
That woman that was killed...
the real-estate broker...

1070
01:10:32,495 --> 01:10:35,863
told me that... that
he was selling the estate,

1071
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:38,699
that the deal was
about to close.

1072
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:39,800
Paul!

1073
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:41,735
Are you out of your... Mind?

1074
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,903
What do you mean, the deal's
just about to close?

1075
01:10:43,905 --> 01:10:45,838
Never mind you didn't have
the respect or the decency

1076
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,706
to ask me for my opinion...
Wesley...

1077
01:10:47,708 --> 01:10:49,741
You also forgot that I own 50%
of this place...

1078
01:10:49,743 --> 01:10:51,409
Could you please
just calm down?

1079
01:10:51,411 --> 01:10:53,844
And I have no intention
of selling this place!

1080
01:10:53,846 --> 01:10:54,811
Wes...

1081
01:10:56,714 --> 01:10:58,547
Wes, I have nothing but respect

1082
01:10:58,549 --> 01:11:00,849
if not complete admiration
for you, and I always have.

1083
01:11:00,851 --> 01:11:02,383
You know that.

1084
01:11:02,385 --> 01:11:03,617
But... but your sickness...

1085
01:11:03,619 --> 01:11:04,818
oh, my sickness.

1086
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:07,453
My sickness has nothing
to do with this!

1087
01:11:07,455 --> 01:11:09,688
Why would we sell this place?!

1088
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:11,823
Not to mention our
responsibility to the people

1089
01:11:11,825 --> 01:11:14,492
that have lived and worked here
for the past 30-odd years.

1090
01:11:14,494 --> 01:11:17,261
Wes, we are not responsible
for these people's lives!

1091
01:11:17,263 --> 01:11:19,296
Agriculture is
no longer profitable.

1092
01:11:19,298 --> 01:11:20,830
We can't...
oh. I'm... I'm sorry.

1093
01:11:20,832 --> 01:11:22,698
I didn't mean to disturb you.

1094
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:25,434
That's okay, violette.
Could you put the drinks down?

1095
01:11:25,436 --> 01:11:27,903
I thought you might be thirsty.

1096
01:11:27,905 --> 01:11:29,938
While you're at it, violette...

1097
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:31,739
Get the... Off my property!

1098
01:11:31,741 --> 01:11:33,724
What? Wesley! I'm sorry.

1099
01:11:33,725 --> 01:11:35,708
I was trying to make him
understand what he's about to do

1100
01:11:35,711 --> 01:11:37,310
to people who are
like family to us.

1101
01:11:37,312 --> 01:11:39,378
What... violette, could
you please leave us?

1102
01:11:39,380 --> 01:11:41,213
Wesley... It's okay. It's okay.

1103
01:11:41,215 --> 01:11:43,215
Violette, would you please leave?!
Don't yell at her!

1104
01:11:43,217 --> 01:11:44,516
You calm down! It's all right.

1105
01:11:44,518 --> 01:11:46,518
I'm sorry. No, it's all right.
I'm leaving.

1106
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,521
I am not gonna let you
get away with this, Paul.

1107
01:11:49,523 --> 01:11:51,322
I will not sign off.

1108
01:11:51,324 --> 01:11:53,824
I don't need you to sign off!

1109
01:11:53,826 --> 01:11:56,259
I've gotten power of attorney.

1110
01:11:56,261 --> 01:11:58,261
You're no longer fit
to make decisions

1111
01:11:58,263 --> 01:11:59,895
regarding your own welfare.

1112
01:12:01,932 --> 01:12:04,599
Wesley, you'd better calm down.
You're a sick man.

1113
01:12:04,601 --> 01:12:06,667
You could very easily
end up dead.

1114
01:12:06,669 --> 01:12:07,968
Are you threatening me?

1115
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:10,320
No.

1116
01:12:10,321 --> 01:12:12,671
I'm just reminding you of your
delicate medical condition.

1117
01:12:12,674 --> 01:12:14,573
You really could end up dead.

1118
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:19,342
Violette?

1119
01:12:21,012 --> 01:12:23,779
Violette, it's Alice dodgson.

1120
01:12:30,921 --> 01:12:32,520
Violette?

1121
01:12:57,746 --> 01:12:58,878
Oh!

1122
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,581
Oh, violette,
I'm sorry to bother you.

1123
01:13:02,583 --> 01:13:05,684
I just... I wanted to...
See if I could get your help.

1124
01:13:05,686 --> 01:13:06,851
It's about Wesley.

1125
01:13:06,853 --> 01:13:08,786
No. Please.

1126
01:13:08,787 --> 01:13:10,720
It's... it's important.
I-I really need your help.

1127
01:13:10,723 --> 01:13:12,556
I can't.

1128
01:13:12,558 --> 01:13:13,990
Please.

1129
01:13:13,992 --> 01:13:16,025
Please don't say no.

1130
01:13:17,528 --> 01:13:20,695
Alice: So, do a lot of people
in Jamaica believe in obeah?

1131
01:13:20,697 --> 01:13:21,996
Violette: You know, they say.

1132
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:26,433
Haiti is 95% catholic
and 100% voodoo.

1133
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:28,168
I suppose the same thing
applies to Jamaica

1134
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,736
where obeah is concerned.

1135
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:32,038
It's just that people don't
like to talk about it.

1136
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,907
I'm not sure if Julian is
going to agree to help you,

1137
01:13:34,909 --> 01:13:37,042
because he's also very afraid.

1138
01:13:37,044 --> 01:13:39,044
Well, tell him
that his son is also sick

1139
01:13:39,046 --> 01:13:41,079
and the only way
we can help his son

1140
01:13:41,081 --> 01:13:44,115
is if we can figure out
who is infecting these people.

1141
01:13:44,117 --> 01:13:47,118
Now, Julian told me
that there's a bigger man...

1142
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,519
an obeah man...

1143
01:13:48,521 --> 01:13:52,055
that is presumably
more powerful than he is.

1144
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:54,924
Julian, he does white magic.
He heals people.

1145
01:13:56,093 --> 01:13:59,160
But... This bigger man...

1146
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:02,162
He take Wesley's soul.

1147
01:14:02,164 --> 01:14:05,898
He take poor Wesley's soul.

1148
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:11,803
Can you tell me who is it
that took Wesley's soul?

1149
01:14:11,805 --> 01:14:13,805
No, no.
I don't know. I don't know.

1150
01:14:13,807 --> 01:14:15,106
I don't... I don't know anybody

1151
01:14:15,108 --> 01:14:17,808
who would do something
like that to Wesley.

1152
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:19,810
He's such a good person.

1153
01:14:19,812 --> 01:14:22,112
When he got sick...

1154
01:14:22,114 --> 01:14:25,181
He thought he was going to die,

1155
01:14:25,183 --> 01:14:27,116
and he wrote his will.

1156
01:14:27,118 --> 01:14:31,086
And he left all his money
to the people who live here...

1157
01:14:31,088 --> 01:14:33,221
everybody.

1158
01:14:33,223 --> 01:14:34,989
Do you know anybody so good?

1159
01:14:52,672 --> 01:14:53,904
Alice?

1160
01:14:59,911 --> 01:15:04,879
This is for if your man leave
you and you want him back,

1161
01:15:04,881 --> 01:15:06,881
and, uh, this is for...

1162
01:15:06,883 --> 01:15:09,783
what about powder... dust...
that you use to make zombies?

1163
01:15:09,785 --> 01:15:11,017
Does that really exist?

1164
01:15:11,019 --> 01:15:13,252
I do not make zombies.

1165
01:15:13,254 --> 01:15:15,087
But if you wanted to,
could you?

1166
01:15:17,925 --> 01:15:21,860
To make someone into a zombie,
you will need...

1167
01:15:21,862 --> 01:15:25,530
A lot of hate in your heart...
anger.

1168
01:15:25,532 --> 01:15:28,165
I understand it's illegal,
and I'm not gonna tell anybody,

1169
01:15:28,167 --> 01:15:30,534
but technically,
do you know how it's done?

1170
01:15:30,536 --> 01:15:33,136
He could make a zombie
if he wanted to,

1171
01:15:33,138 --> 01:15:35,138
but he wouldn't.

1172
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:37,206
But there is a way.

1173
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:42,611
The powder...

1174
01:15:42,613 --> 01:15:45,013
It is like poison...

1175
01:15:45,015 --> 01:15:48,149
like they use in the Gulf war,

1176
01:15:48,151 --> 01:15:52,653
like... Biochemical poison.

1177
01:15:52,655 --> 01:15:55,822
It will not kill.

1178
01:15:55,824 --> 01:15:59,792
It will only take away
the humanity of the man...

1179
01:15:59,794 --> 01:16:01,193
the soul.

1180
01:16:01,195 --> 01:16:03,128
It... it take your will.

1181
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:06,131
It's like you are there,
but you're not there.

1182
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:09,901
Is it... is this permanent,
like that guy out there?

1183
01:16:09,903 --> 01:16:12,036
Not necessarily.

1184
01:16:12,038 --> 01:16:14,905
There is another powder.

1185
01:16:14,907 --> 01:16:17,807
You give it to somebody
who was made into a zombie.

1186
01:16:17,809 --> 01:16:21,277
But it will only work
if you give it in time.

1187
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:23,279
You mean like an antidote?

1188
01:16:23,281 --> 01:16:24,980
Yeah.

1189
01:16:24,982 --> 01:16:26,881
Toxins and neurology, I get.

1190
01:16:26,883 --> 01:16:29,283
But the visions...
the mind thing...

1191
01:16:29,285 --> 01:16:31,217
how does that happen?

1192
01:16:48,167 --> 01:16:50,300
Is this really necessary?

1193
01:16:50,302 --> 01:16:51,634
Oh, come on.

1194
01:16:52,637 --> 01:16:54,136
You look beautiful.

1195
01:16:54,138 --> 01:16:57,072
Anyway, it makes the gods happy

1196
01:16:57,074 --> 01:16:59,274
when you make yourself
pretty for them.

1197
01:16:59,276 --> 01:17:01,709
Well, the first God
that looks down my blouse

1198
01:17:01,711 --> 01:17:03,210
gets a bloody nose.

1199
01:18:44,038 --> 01:18:47,039
Jenny: Help... Me.

1200
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:50,042
Help... Me.

1201
01:18:51,779 --> 01:18:53,745
Help... Me.

1202
01:18:53,747 --> 01:18:54,979
Help... Me.

1203
01:18:54,981 --> 01:18:56,347
Help... Me.

1204
01:19:06,056 --> 01:19:08,289
Alice, you all right? You okay?

1205
01:19:08,291 --> 01:19:10,057
Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay.

1206
01:19:10,059 --> 01:19:11,358
I just...

1207
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,960
Something just... Happened.

1208
01:19:13,962 --> 01:19:16,095
I don't...
I just saw something.

1209
01:19:16,097 --> 01:19:21,066
Uh, thank you for...
thank you for taking me here.

1210
01:19:21,068 --> 01:19:22,867
Uh, I have to go now.

1211
01:19:22,869 --> 01:19:25,035
But what are you going to do?

1212
01:19:26,438 --> 01:19:27,770
What are you lookin' at?

1213
01:19:29,273 --> 01:19:30,939
Alice:
You mean like an antidote?

1214
01:19:33,009 --> 01:19:35,275
Thank you.

1215
01:20:19,819 --> 01:20:24,821
¶ It's never too late

Dr. Polidori to you.

1221
01:20:41,537 --> 01:20:44,137
You want to know?
I'll tell you what I'm doing.

1222
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:47,974
I am creating an antidote
to this virus.

1223

how?

1226
01:20:52,913 --> 01:20:55,213
I'm going to inject
an animal with the virus

1227
01:20:55,215 --> 01:20:58,816
and let it create antibodies
that we can then use.

1228
01:20:58,818 --> 01:21:00,284
So you're saying it's curable?

1229
01:21:00,286 --> 01:21:01,485
Oh, yeah. It's curable.

1230
01:21:01,487 --> 01:21:02,819
¶ It's never too late ¶

1231
01:21:02,821 --> 01:21:03,986
can I kiss you?

1232
01:21:03,988 --> 01:21:05,554
No, you can't kiss me!

1233
01:21:05,556 --> 01:21:07,422
Don't you want to know
about the virus?

1234
01:21:07,424 --> 01:21:09,090
Okay, okay. What's the virus?

1235
01:21:09,092 --> 01:21:11,358
Okay, the virus is
a lot like lymphocytosis,

1236
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,393
which is what's throwing
everybody off.

1237
01:21:13,395 --> 01:21:16,529
What we have is f.E.L.V.,
which is feline leukemia

1238
01:21:16,531 --> 01:21:19,398
which has been altered so that
it can infect human beings.

1239
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,500
Now, what kind of a doctor
do you think

1240
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:24,035
would be able to come up
with something like that?

1241
01:21:24,037 --> 01:21:25,369
Veterinarian.

1242
01:21:25,371 --> 01:21:27,971
Exactly. And who do we know?

1243
01:21:27,973 --> 01:21:29,872
¶ Constantly create
new diseases ¶

1244
01:21:29,874 --> 01:21:31,340
Matthew hope.

1245
01:21:31,342 --> 01:21:33,875
Alice: Your charming brother
wants to sell the place,

1246
01:21:33,877 --> 01:21:35,343
knows that you'll block it,

1247
01:21:35,345 --> 01:21:37,478
so he gets the mysterious
"bigger man"

1248
01:21:37,480 --> 01:21:40,547
to infect you with the virus
and, with obeah,

1249
01:21:40,549 --> 01:21:43,016
basically render you
the village idiot.

1250
01:21:43,018 --> 01:21:44,484
No offense. None taken.

1251
01:21:44,486 --> 01:21:47,353
Wait. If that's true,
why does Paul take the time

1252
01:21:47,355 --> 01:21:49,521
to get a first doctor
and a second doctor?

1253
01:21:49,523 --> 01:21:51,523
Why does he not
just let Wesley die?

1254
01:21:51,525 --> 01:21:52,490
No offense.

1255
01:21:52,492 --> 01:21:54,525
None taken, but go on.

1256
01:21:54,527 --> 01:21:57,895
Because this wonderful
village idiot writes a will

1257
01:21:57,897 --> 01:22:00,564
leaving his half of the property
to the workers.

1258
01:22:00,566 --> 01:22:03,250
Really?

1259
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,935
The trick is to keep
young Wesley alive yet unwell.

1260
01:22:05,938 --> 01:22:08,505
So why kill Dr. Winsvold
and... and dori?

1261
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:10,390
The servant girl...

1262
01:22:10,391 --> 01:22:12,274
she was killed the same night
the doctor had the heart attack.

1263
01:22:12,277 --> 01:22:14,277
And then the real-estate
couple.

1264
01:22:14,279 --> 01:22:16,079
They had to get rid
of Dr. Winsvold

1265
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,880
probably because he was
about to identify the virus,

1266
01:22:17,882 --> 01:22:19,948
which is why they deleted
the last month

1267
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:21,316
of the medical records.

1268
01:22:21,318 --> 01:22:23,885
So they get rid of Matthew hope
and Jackson,

1269
01:22:23,887 --> 01:22:26,087
that real-estate woman gets
hacked up...

1270
01:22:26,089 --> 01:22:27,254
it sure looks to me

1271
01:22:27,256 --> 01:22:29,456
like somebody's covering
their tracks.

1272
01:22:29,458 --> 01:22:33,092
There's still a piece missing
that I will find if it kills me.

1273
01:22:34,595 --> 01:22:36,628
Bad choice of words.

1274
01:22:38,932 --> 01:22:41,865
No, the whole $100 million.

1275
01:22:43,969 --> 01:22:45,601
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

1276
01:22:45,603 --> 01:22:47,970
I'll... I'll call you
right back. Okay. Thank you.

1277
01:22:47,972 --> 01:22:49,722
Got good news.

1278
01:22:49,723 --> 01:22:51,473
Hey, you know, I'm
a little busy right now.

1279
01:22:51,475 --> 01:22:54,409
Well, great news
for Wesley, anyway.

1280
01:22:54,411 --> 01:22:56,544
Your brother's gonna be fine.

1281
01:23:02,017 --> 01:23:03,649
Really?

1282
01:23:03,651 --> 01:23:05,417
Wow.

1283
01:23:05,419 --> 01:23:07,452
You don't look happy.

1284
01:23:07,454 --> 01:23:09,220
Oh, that's great news. Really.

1285
01:23:09,222 --> 01:23:11,021
I mean,
it's... it's a surprise.

1286
01:23:11,023 --> 01:23:12,022
Well, does he know?

1287
01:23:12,024 --> 01:23:13,590
He was first to know.

1288
01:23:13,592 --> 01:23:15,475
Hmm.

1289
01:23:15,476 --> 01:23:17,359
Oh, well, then, I guess we're
gonna have to celebrate, huh?

1290
01:23:17,362 --> 01:23:18,661
Is he in his room?

1291
01:23:18,663 --> 01:23:20,462
Oh, you know, he's not.

1292
01:23:20,464 --> 01:23:21,963
He's downtown at the courthouse

1293
01:23:21,965 --> 01:23:23,631
getting your power
of attorney revoked,

1294
01:23:23,633 --> 01:23:26,300
seeing as he's in full control
of his faculties.

1295
01:23:26,302 --> 01:23:29,603
Oh! Oh, also... I called a couple
friends of mine in New York,

1296
01:23:29,605 --> 01:23:31,938
and I said, "just check up
on me tomorrow...

1297
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:34,775
you know,
in case I turn up dead."

1298
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:37,677
Alice...

1299
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,613
I think you're as crazy
as my brother.

1300
01:24:19,653 --> 01:24:22,320
Is there a problem,
superintendent?

1301
01:24:22,322 --> 01:24:24,422
No problem.

1302
01:24:24,424 --> 01:24:27,258
Just need to clear
some things up.

1303
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:29,326
You care to join us?

1304
01:24:29,328 --> 01:24:32,329
We'll go back to the station.
It'll take a minute.

1305
01:24:32,331 --> 01:24:34,331
Okay.

1306
01:24:34,333 --> 01:24:37,467
I just need to go and see
the judge.

1307
01:24:37,469 --> 01:24:39,402
So if you don't mind
waiting five minutes...

1308
01:24:39,404 --> 01:24:41,404
we don't have five minutes.

1309
01:24:41,406 --> 01:24:43,539
Busy, busy day.

1310
01:24:45,142 --> 01:24:46,474
You have a warrant?

1311
01:24:46,476 --> 01:24:49,109
We don't need it.

1312
01:24:49,111 --> 01:24:51,144
I'll see you in five minutes.

1313
01:24:52,847 --> 01:24:54,446
Take him!

1314
01:24:54,448 --> 01:24:57,348
Get your hands off me!
Get your hands off me!

1315
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:03,420
Violette! Violette: Hmm?

1316
01:25:03,422 --> 01:25:06,723
I can't find Wesley anywhere,
or the doctor.

1317
01:25:06,725 --> 01:25:09,726
The doctor's in
the livestock yard.

1318
01:25:09,728 --> 01:25:12,095
And Wesley?

1319
01:25:12,097 --> 01:25:14,330
I haven't seen Wesley all day.

1320
01:25:18,435 --> 01:25:20,668
Wesley!

1321
01:25:24,106 --> 01:25:26,539
Caro: Wesley!

1322
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:34,579
Wesley?

1323
01:25:49,158 --> 01:25:51,124
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1324
01:25:51,126 --> 01:25:52,792
Those drums...

1325
01:25:52,794 --> 01:25:54,627
Are not Julian's.

1326
01:25:54,629 --> 01:25:57,463
I have a very bad feeling.

1327
01:25:57,465 --> 01:25:59,565
Let's go.

1328
01:26:02,403 --> 01:26:05,637
Caro: Guys, I'm in a hurry!
Come on! Get out the way!

1329
01:26:05,639 --> 01:26:07,505
The road is closed.

1330
01:26:07,507 --> 01:26:10,307
What do mean, the road is closed?
Where are you going?

1331
01:26:10,309 --> 01:26:11,608
Caro...

1332
01:26:11,610 --> 01:26:12,909
You can't leave. Caro...

1333
01:26:12,911 --> 01:26:14,610
It's unsafe.

1334
01:26:16,780 --> 01:26:22,316
When I need to ask
some big, fat slob...

1335
01:26:22,318 --> 01:26:25,218
For his opinion...

1336
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:26,852
I'll call you.

1337
01:26:32,558 --> 01:26:34,624
I have an idea.

1338
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,599
There's another way.

1339
01:26:45,601 --> 01:26:47,701
I haven't tried it
since I was a child.

1340
01:26:47,703 --> 01:26:49,936
It could be blocked.

1341
01:26:51,472 --> 01:26:53,939
Could be a little scary.

1342
01:26:55,943 --> 01:26:58,310
Okay.

1343
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:07,851
How... how is this a way out?

1344
01:27:07,853 --> 01:27:11,788
The original plantation owner
built an escape tunnel

1345
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:14,490
in case the slaves got
machete-happy.

1346
01:27:14,492 --> 01:27:15,624
Oh, great.

1347
01:27:24,566 --> 01:27:27,300
It's just a bat.

1348
01:27:27,302 --> 01:27:29,702
Oh. A bat. Perfect.

1349
01:27:29,704 --> 01:27:32,571
Alice: Which way?

1350
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:34,872
That way.

1351
01:27:41,379 --> 01:27:43,212
Come on. Alice... Alice...

1352
01:27:43,214 --> 01:27:45,380
I can't. Yeah, you can.

1353
01:27:45,382 --> 01:27:47,215
I can't. I can't.

1354
01:27:47,217 --> 01:27:49,550
Uh, okay.

1355
01:27:51,887 --> 01:27:54,387
I'm gonna go on up ahead.
No. No, Alice.

1356
01:27:54,389 --> 01:27:56,455
I don't want you out there
by yourself.

1357
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:02,294
I'll be okay.

1358
01:28:02,296 --> 01:28:03,595
I think.

1359
01:28:03,597 --> 01:28:04,762
Are you sure? Yeah.

1360
01:28:32,686 --> 01:28:34,419
Please don't scream.

1361
01:28:34,421 --> 01:28:36,654
I know where I'm taking you.

1362
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:40,174
I am sorry.

1363
01:28:40,175 --> 01:28:42,575
You've got to stop scaring me like this.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1364
01:29:04,949 --> 01:29:06,348
Get down!

1365
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,020
They might turn him
into a zombie.

1366
01:29:49,422 --> 01:29:51,722
I didn't want to do this,
you know.

1367
01:29:51,724 --> 01:29:53,390
You made me.

1368
01:29:53,392 --> 01:29:54,958
It's your fault.

1369
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,461
You... Greedy...

1370
01:30:02,967 --> 01:30:05,434
No.

1371
01:31:08,622 --> 01:31:10,922
Hold on to this.

1372
01:31:38,416 --> 01:31:40,549
Aah!

1373
01:31:42,019 --> 01:31:43,585
Don't even think about it.

1374
01:31:43,587 --> 01:31:44,786
Alice, this isn't gonna work!

1375
01:31:44,788 --> 01:31:46,654
Oh, yeah? You dig him up.

1376
01:31:54,863 --> 01:31:58,431
You... Bitch!

1377
01:32:10,577 --> 01:32:11,842
Aah!

1378
01:32:31,694 --> 01:32:33,627
In a way...

1379
01:32:33,629 --> 01:32:36,763
This is just like a wedding...

1380
01:32:36,765 --> 01:32:41,634
you and Wesley united forever
in merry zombiehood.

1381
01:32:41,636 --> 01:32:43,535
Why'd you do this?

1382
01:32:43,537 --> 01:32:46,771
How would you like growing up
in the claybourne house

1383
01:32:46,773 --> 01:32:49,473
with the servants?

1384
01:32:49,475 --> 01:32:51,641
Me... a claybourne.

1385
01:32:52,910 --> 01:32:55,977
Claybourne?
What are you talking about?

1386
01:32:58,047 --> 01:33:00,780
Your father, Richard...

1387
01:33:03,584 --> 01:33:06,084
was my father.

1388
01:33:06,086 --> 01:33:07,685
He killed my mother

1389
01:33:07,687 --> 01:33:10,254
so your mother wouldn't
find out about me.

1390
01:33:10,256 --> 01:33:12,089
But she did find out,

1391
01:33:12,091 --> 01:33:14,524
and you know
what he did to her.

1392
01:33:15,693 --> 01:33:18,593
Funny how history repeat
itself.

1393
01:33:18,595 --> 01:33:22,830
That servant girl
you knock up... same thing.

1394
01:33:22,832 --> 01:33:26,533
Like father... Like son.

1395
01:33:27,669 --> 01:33:31,037
So you're asking me why.

1396
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:35,941
Revenge for my mother.

1397
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:38,143
And the money.

1398
01:33:39,713 --> 01:33:41,746
So, Paul...

1399
01:33:41,747 --> 01:33:43,780
Tomorrow your dead body
will be found up here

1400
01:33:43,783 --> 01:33:45,682
with three zombies
roaming around.

1401
01:33:45,684 --> 01:33:49,152
And the estate go to
the next claybourne in line,

1402
01:33:49,154 --> 01:33:51,888
which is me.

1403
01:33:53,391 --> 01:33:55,824
No one will ever believe you.

1404
01:33:55,826 --> 01:33:59,060
DNA, brother.

1405
01:34:00,963 --> 01:34:02,696
Aah! Alice: Oh, God!

1406
01:34:03,832 --> 01:34:05,832
No!

1407
01:34:07,402 --> 01:34:11,871
I...Was... I was gonna...

1408
01:34:11,873 --> 01:34:13,906
Give you so much money.

1409
01:34:13,908 --> 01:34:16,375
I don't want "so much money."

1410
01:34:17,745 --> 01:34:19,244
I want all the money.

1411
01:34:25,783 --> 01:34:28,350
And you.

1412
01:34:29,953 --> 01:34:33,421
Girl... You, I like.

1413
01:34:33,423 --> 01:34:36,791
Tried everything
to get you to go.

1414
01:34:36,793 --> 01:34:39,960
Doll hanging in your room.

1415
01:34:39,962 --> 01:34:42,062
Smashed up the lab.

1416
01:34:42,064 --> 01:34:44,431
Nothing work.

1417
01:34:44,433 --> 01:34:48,368
You faked being sick.

1418
01:34:48,370 --> 01:34:50,370
Mm-hmm.

1419
01:34:50,372 --> 01:34:54,307
Made me feel bad infecting
you with a dirty swab.

1420
01:34:54,309 --> 01:34:57,009
Not the others.

1421
01:34:57,011 --> 01:34:59,528
Even Jackson.

1422
01:34:59,529 --> 01:35:02,046
It was fun trancin' him
into killin' Paul's poom-poom.

1423
01:35:02,049 --> 01:35:04,916
And them real-estate ass.

1424
01:35:09,689 --> 01:35:13,057
How about we both have
some fun?

1425
01:35:13,059 --> 01:35:16,093
You blow this in j.B.'S face.

1426
01:35:16,095 --> 01:35:18,929
You turn him into a zombie.

1427
01:35:20,966 --> 01:35:22,332
No.

1428
01:35:22,334 --> 01:35:26,169
I can make you do it.

1429
01:36:35,868 --> 01:36:38,335
Come on! Come on! Come on!

1430
01:36:38,337 --> 01:36:40,337
Come on. Come on!

1431
01:36:40,339 --> 01:36:42,005
We got to dig him out

1432
01:36:42,007 --> 01:36:44,173
and go to Julian's
to get the antidote powder.

1433
01:36:44,175 --> 01:36:45,841
Could be a bit too late.

1434
01:36:45,843 --> 01:36:46,842
Hurry!

1435
01:36:54,383 --> 01:36:58,351
Man: In the presence of God
and before this congregation,

1436
01:36:58,353 --> 01:37:02,121
this man and woman have given
their consent

1437
01:37:02,123 --> 01:37:05,290
and made their marriage vows
to each other.

1438
01:37:05,292 --> 01:37:07,258
They have declared
their marriage

1439
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:09,293
by the giving of rings.

1440
01:37:09,295 --> 01:37:13,363
I therefore proclaim
by the powers vested in me

1441
01:37:13,365 --> 01:37:15,965
that they are husband and wife.

1442
01:37:15,967 --> 01:37:18,133
You may kiss the bride.

1443
01:38:09,213 --> 01:38:10,378
Hmm.

1444
01:38:12,348 --> 01:38:15,282

1445
01:38:40,141 --> 01:38:43,976
¶ Oh, weeks went by,
and summer came down ¶

1446
01:38:43,978 --> 01:38:47,446
¶ soon another girl
from the island he found ¶

1447
01:38:47,448 --> 01:38:51,149
¶ he went to his father
to name the day ¶

1448
01:38:51,151 --> 01:38:53,651
¶ his father shook his head
and started to say ¶

1449
01:38:53,653 --> 01:38:55,303
¶ you can't marry her! ¶

1450
01:38:55,304 --> 01:38:56,954
¶ "you can't marry this girl ¶

1451
01:38:56,956 --> 01:38:58,522
¶ "you've gotta say no ¶

1452
01:38:58,524 --> 01:39:02,425
¶ the girl is your sister,
but your mama don't know" ¶

1453
01:39:02,427 --> 01:39:04,293
¶ whoa, it worries me ¶

1454
01:39:04,295 --> 01:39:06,161
¶ shame in the family ¶

1455
01:39:06,163 --> 01:39:08,263
¶ shame and scandal
in the family ¶

1456
01:39:08,265 --> 01:39:10,098
¶ shame ¶
