Jimmy: stop bitching and start gorging, carl.

171
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,530
We are officially
underway.

172
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,916
Carl: that's it?
Aren't we supposed to wait, like, 30 minutes

173
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:16,701
before walking
70 miles?

174
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:18,569
You're such
a pussy.

175
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,571
Maybe that's
why i love you.

176
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,290
God, it was freezing
down there, jimmy.

177
00:07:22,292 --> 00:07:24,775
If i had testicles,
they'd be up inside my body right now.

178
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,263
If you had testicles,
you'd be getting raped by a seal.

179
00:07:28,265 --> 00:07:29,914
No means no.

180
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:30,998
I don't know
what that means.

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,733
It's a non sequitur,
my friend.

182
00:07:32,735 --> 00:07:34,352
Not everything has
to have meaning.

183
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,637
Our lives should.
Ugh! Here we go...

184
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,322
don't you ever think about anything, jimmy?

185
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,774
Like why we
live here.

186
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:41,809
We could move to anywhere in the world we wanted to.

187
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,110
Carl, where are we
going to move to,

188
00:07:43,112 --> 00:07:44,896
and how are we going
to get there, burrow?

189
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,748
It's not like we can go on the internet and find a deal.

190
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,800
This is what
we do.

191
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,968
We walk 70 miles
for sand dabs.

192
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,671
Male: god, i love sand dabs.
They're so good.

193
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,940
All succulent, pan-fried
with a little butter.

194
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:56,991
I don't know.

195
00:07:56,993 --> 00:07:58,292
We could move
to los angeles.

196
00:07:58,294 --> 00:08:00,895
All we do is walk.
Nobody walks in l.a.

197
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,814
new york?
You'd freeze your ass off in the winter.

198
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:05,767
Chicago?
Too windy.

199
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:08,419
Palm springs?
I see dead people.

200
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,137
Carl, the problem's
not where we live,

201
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:11,772
the problem is what
you got going on

202
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:14,141
inside that neurotic
little head of yours.

203
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:15,426
It's hopeless,
jimmy.

204
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,127
If i was eaten by a
killer seal right now,

205
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:18,546
nobody would
even miss me.

206
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:20,148
Hey, shithead!

207
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,232
[Smack]
ow!

208
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:22,316
I would miss you,

209
00:08:22,318 --> 00:08:24,318
all of our other friends
would miss you too.

210
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,903
Yeah! We'd miss you, carl.
You go, girl.

211
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,105
Jimmy: oh,
you gotta shake it off, bro.

212
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,907
It's time to get
out of your slump.

213
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,459
You're going to meet
somebody again.

214
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:33,094
Maybe even <i>the one.</i>

215
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:34,946
Carl: yeah,
the one of four who leaves me.

216
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,063
Listen, carl,

217
00:08:36,065 --> 00:08:38,199
i can really help you
find a woman this year,

218
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:40,818
but you've got to
help me help you.

219
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,637
You can't be so
freakin' needy.

220
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:43,871
You have to
ask yourself,

221
00:08:43,873 --> 00:08:46,174
what are you really
looking for in a woman?

222
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,727
Carl: i just want someone who gets me

223
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,330
for who i am, not for
how much money i have,

224
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,965
or for the car
that i drive,

225
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,516
or for the clothes
that i wear,

226
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:57,084
but for who
i am inside.

227
00:08:57,086 --> 00:08:59,387
Jimmy: what the fuck are you talking about?

228
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:01,455
Carl: it's a monologue for my acting class

229
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,490
but it's how
i really feel.

230
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:05,043
[Clapping]
excellent scene!

231
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,260
Very moving!

232
00:09:06,262 --> 00:09:09,046
I really felt
his pain.

who didn't just
want me for my body.

Stefan called
me frigid

244
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,408
'cause i didn't want to make a baby with him.

245
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,410
Aw, girl, out here
we're all frigid.

trying to get you puddin' pie.

for saying this,

was an asshole.

Oh, you're
young yet, baby.

00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:52,456
It's normal.

Trust me,
it's part of your feminine education.

the cute ones.

Not always!

Remember when
i dated ralph?

00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:03,000
He was an asshole
and he was u-gly!

258

Why'd you go
out with him?

259
00:10:04,554 --> 00:10:07,020

Vicky: i thought i told you about that.

267
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,191
He got sat on
by a walrus.

268
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:28,776
Smashed his
head flat.

269
00:10:28,778 --> 00:10:30,511
He was never the
same afterwards.

Oh, my god! It
didn't kill him?

Uh-uh...
not right away.

Girl, he died months later choking on a damn anchovy.

His head was smashed so flat,
he couldn't even swallow it!

Tsk. Oh, i'm
sorry, vicky.

he could get uglier,

if he didn't.

We come to a spa

get all dolled-up,
fix our hair,

get our nails done,
get our eyebrows waxed,

there's nothing
wrong with it,

341
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,657

i just kind of thought that you were...

To have a woman
who understands me.

380
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,680
Oh, that's good. And
what is it that you think

381
00:14:26,682 --> 00:14:28,399
would help a woman
understand you?

382
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,752
Um... if maybe
i understood her?

Mm-hmm.

384
00:14:33,222 --> 00:14:36,874

if i wasn't so... needy.

I've told
him that too!

386

need to get laid all the time.

make you feel, carl?

It's a great

and drinking?

We did?
Yes.

Well, it was nice
talking to you guys.

you think that
guy likes you?

1236
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:23,705
God, i thought he was having a heart attack.

1237
00:47:25,026 --> 00:47:27,225
Jimmy: i've never seen anyone cock-block themselves

1238
00:47:27,227 --> 00:47:29,194
quicker than what
i just witnessed.

1239
00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:31,263
She's the most beautiful girl i've ever seen.

1240
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,348
And she's gone...

1241
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,250
to be with
anyone but you,

1242
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:36,885
because you just acted like a groupie on acid.

1243
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:38,620
But i think i can
still salvage this.

1244
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:39,605
You do?

1245
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:40,956
Carl, i'm your
best friend.

1246
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,474
You were depressed
for 70 miles,

1247
00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:43,742
and yet here you are,

1248
00:47:43,744 --> 00:47:45,561
with a crush on the
first girl you meet?

1249
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:46,611
It's a miracle.

1250
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,514
I don't think
it's just a crush.

1251
00:47:48,516 --> 00:47:50,549
I think i've already
fallen in love with her.

1252
00:47:50,551 --> 00:47:53,602
You told me, when i
find her i'll know.

1253
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:54,752
Well, i know, jimmy.

1254
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,273
It's love.

Narrator:
<i>yes, jimmy. Love.</i>

1256

<i>In fact,</i>
<i>the whole reason the penguins make this journey</i>

1257
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:06,097
<i>is for love.</i>

1258
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:09,051
<i>Yes, perhaps the love of</i>
<i>the mating ritual itself,</i>

1259
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,970

I've had five husbands
and four children.

1266

fired blanks.

So i think you raised
an interesting point

1270
00:48:34,261 --> 00:48:35,894
with your theory
of animal love.

1271
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:38,029
I was in love twice.

1272
