1
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:10,443
(relaxing music)

2
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:05,331
- [Woman] Um, what do
you think you're doing?

3
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:07,766
- Ah.

4
00:02:08,434 --> 00:02:10,236
- That's mine.

5
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:11,937
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

6
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,940
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:02:13,973 --> 00:02:14,974
Give it back.

8
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:18,611
- I'll tell you, you're a very
lucky girl.

9
00:02:20,046 --> 00:02:21,615
- Oh really, why is that?

10
00:02:21,648 --> 00:02:24,450
- For one, I speak English.

11
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:30,557
Two, I'm not a rapist or a
serial killer.

12
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,591
- Well,

13
00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:34,528
what makes you so sure I'm not a
rapist?

14
00:02:35,595 --> 00:02:36,596
- Oh.

15
00:02:37,197 --> 00:02:38,933
Are you saying you wanna rape
me?

16
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:39,967
- Would you like it?

17
00:02:41,601 --> 00:02:43,203
- I like to live on the edge,
too.

18
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:47,241
Okay, I'll tell you what.

19
00:02:47,274 --> 00:02:48,609
I'll give you your camera back

20
00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:51,612
even though you illegally
took pictures of me.

21
00:02:51,646 --> 00:02:53,528
But, then you have to
come for a coffee with me.

22
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:57,152
- Um, I don't have time for
coffee.

23
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:58,186
Sorry.

24
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,433
- Well, I'm the one who's sorry

25
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:04,625
'cause I'm keeping the camera.

26
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:05,660
- Fine.

27
00:03:09,765 --> 00:03:14,369
(upbeat music)

28
00:05:23,003 --> 00:05:24,271
- Welcome to my home.

29
00:05:25,372 --> 00:05:26,373
- Wow.

30
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:42,824
Oh my God, this view.

31
00:05:46,861 --> 00:05:48,163
I can't believe you live here.

32
00:05:50,432 --> 00:05:51,033
- Do you wanna a drink?

33
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,700
I'm gonna go get a drink.

34
00:05:52,734 --> 00:05:53,368
- Uh, yeah.

35
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:54,402
- Yeah.

36
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:15,191
Hey, there.

37
00:06:15,224 --> 00:06:16,225
- Thanks.

38
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:23,266
This book is amazing.

39
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,300
- Yeah.

40
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:26,870
That's my parents.

41
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,542
I mean it belongs to my parents.

42
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:34,944
Not them.

43
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,714
- Kinda looks like you.

44
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:38,682
- Right.

45
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:39,716
- Are they here?

46
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:41,551
- No.

47
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:43,320
They're on vacation.

48
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:45,122
But, they live here.

49
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:46,356
I mean, I live with them.

50
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,429
- It's beautiful.

51
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,435
(slow music)

52
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:23,562
- [Man] So?

53
00:07:23,595 --> 00:07:24,596
- [Woman] What?

54
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:27,233
- [Man] Are you gonna
tell me why you're here?

55
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:29,635
- You invited me in.

56
00:07:31,603 --> 00:07:34,040
- I meant here as in Paris.

57
00:07:34,073 --> 00:07:35,908
- Are you gonna tell me
why you speak English?

58
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:38,578
- I went to the American school
in Paris.

59
00:07:41,614 --> 00:07:43,256
- [Woman] Did you ever live in
The States?

60
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,418
- Yes.

61
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:47,320
- [Woman] But, you came back, of
course.

62
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:48,855
- No, not of course.

63
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:50,123
I didn't wanna come back.

64
00:07:51,324 --> 00:07:52,525
- Why not?

65
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:54,928
Paris is the most beautiful
city in the world.

66
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:56,964
- [Man] Yeah, that's what
Americans say.

67
00:07:56,997 --> 00:07:58,498
- [Woman] That's what everyone
says.

68
00:07:58,531 --> 00:08:02,403
(crackling)

69
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:08,209
- [Man] So?

70
00:08:09,543 --> 00:08:10,904
Where are you from?
- [Woman] What?

71
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,481
America.

72
00:08:16,617 --> 00:08:17,618
- [Man] That's vague.

73
00:08:23,491 --> 00:08:25,026
I meant where as in

74
00:08:25,059 --> 00:08:26,394
where are you parents right now?

75
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:31,613
- I have no idea where my
parents are.

76
00:08:35,404 --> 00:08:37,106
- [Man] What do you mean?

77
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:38,140
- I mean

78
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,109
they could be in the kitchen

79
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,044
or the living room

80
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:44,046
or the bedroom.

81
00:08:45,214 --> 00:08:46,448
I mean, they could be dead.

82
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,091
- Where you going?

83
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:00,863
- Shower.

84
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:03,333
- End of the hallway.

85
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:21,518
Oh, hey.

86
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:24,888
- Hey, can I borrow a
t-shirt and underwear?

87
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:27,358
I left all my stuff at a cafe
somewhere.

88
00:09:27,391 --> 00:09:28,392
- You what?

89
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,062
Okay, sure.

90
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:35,166
- What are you reading?

91
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:38,436
- Um, I'm reading this
really interesting book

92
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,471
called 'War'.

93
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,640
- What's it about?

94
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,812
- Um, right now, I'm reading
this chapter

95
00:09:47,845 --> 00:09:49,681
about fear, you know.

96
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,250
And, about how,

97
00:09:52,284 --> 00:09:55,420
for instance, the snipers, they
have to

98
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:58,624
perform well under pressure, you
know.

99
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:00,458
- [Woman] Wow, that
sounds really interesting.

100
00:10:00,993 --> 00:10:01,760
- Yeah.

101
00:10:01,794 --> 00:10:02,761
It is really interesting.

102
00:10:02,795 --> 00:10:05,531
And then, there's this
other chapter about...

103
00:10:50,545 --> 00:10:51,612
So?

104
00:10:51,646 --> 00:10:53,288
Do you have a place to stay for
the night?

105
00:11:06,027 --> 00:11:07,428
You can stay here if you want.

106
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:13,669
- Thanks.

107
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,881
- You're really hungry, aren't
you?

108
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:44,834
So, you're gonna have to pick
up your stuff at some point.

109
00:11:48,972 --> 00:11:50,773
- It's fine, I can do that
tomorrow.

110
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:51,808
- Yeah.

111
00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,644
You're not too worried
about things, are you?

112
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:05,122
(slow music)

113
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,608
Hey.

114
00:12:58,344 --> 00:12:59,612
- Hey.

115
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:00,680
- You awake?

116
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,184
- Yes.

117
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,353
- What's your name?

118
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:11,825
- Alessia.

119
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:13,960
You?

120
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:14,995
- Florent.

121
00:13:16,229 --> 00:13:17,230
- What?

122
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:20,767
- Florent.

123
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:24,871
- Goodnight.

124
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,542
- Goodnight.

125
00:14:15,859 --> 00:14:17,160
- So, are you on vacation?

126
00:14:18,694 --> 00:14:20,363
- Not really.

127
00:14:20,396 --> 00:14:21,638
- What do you mean, not really?

128
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:28,972
And, are you a student?

129
00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:31,808
- Not anymore.

130
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:32,842
- What do you do?

131
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:36,080
- She's a photographer.

132
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:38,115
- That's not true.

133
00:14:39,783 --> 00:14:40,905
- [Florent] I think you are.

134
00:14:42,219 --> 00:14:43,701
- Did you make money with
photography?

135
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,816
- So, what's there to see today?

136
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:12,551
- Um, I don't know.

137
00:15:12,584 --> 00:15:13,585
What do you wanna see?

138
00:15:14,352 --> 00:15:16,455
- Maybe you should take her to
Normandie.

139
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:18,009
- [Florent] That's kinda nice
actually.

140
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:25,464
- [Alessia] I gotta go.

141
00:15:25,497 --> 00:15:26,298
- Where you going?

142
00:15:26,332 --> 00:15:27,333
Hey, wait.

143
00:15:38,377 --> 00:15:43,383
(laid-back music)

144
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:44,584
Hey.

145
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,655
Can you wait.

146
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:49,689
Wait.

147
00:15:51,358 --> 00:15:52,325
Wait, where you going?

148
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:53,360
Hey.

149
00:15:55,628 --> 00:15:57,264
Are you crying?

150
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:59,299
- I'm not crying.

151
00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:00,568
- 'Kay, what's wrong with you?

152
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:02,570
- Nothing.

153
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:04,872
- Hey, look.

154
00:16:04,905 --> 00:16:07,475
He's my best friend and he
doesn't know you, alright.

155
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,585
You know he's just a student,

156
00:16:08,609 --> 00:16:10,254
thinks he's gonna change
the world and he knows

157
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:11,845
- He doesn't know shit about me.

158
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,081
Mother fuck.

159
00:16:13,114 --> 00:16:14,424
- Of course he doesn't
know shit about you.

160
00:16:14,448 --> 00:16:15,783
I don't know shit about you.

161
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:16,784
You never say anything.

162
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:17,786
You never answer my questions.

163
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:19,788
- I have more important shit to
do.

164
00:16:19,821 --> 00:16:20,855
Sit there.

165
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:21,790
While he's talking about me
- [Florent] Really?

166
00:16:21,823 --> 00:16:23,100
In French.
- [Florent] Really, like what?

167
00:16:23,124 --> 00:16:24,234
More important things to do.

168
00:16:24,258 --> 00:16:25,259
- Like what?

169
00:16:26,761 --> 00:16:28,830
See again, you're not
answering my questions.

170
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:34,703
Wait.

171
00:16:37,172 --> 00:16:38,173
Wait.

172
00:16:39,074 --> 00:16:40,943
Listen, listen to me, okay.

173
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:42,311
This guy's my best friend

174
00:16:42,344 --> 00:16:44,213
and you're being very rude,
okay.

175
00:16:44,246 --> 00:16:46,015
I've been very kind to you.

176
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,917
This is very disrespectful.

177
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,118
So, stop it right now.

178
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,921
- You've been kind to me?

179
00:16:53,122 --> 00:16:54,056
- Yes.

180
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:54,924
- Why?

181
00:16:54,957 --> 00:16:55,591
'Cause you let me sleep at your
house

182
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:56,892
and I don't let you fuck me?

183
00:16:58,561 --> 00:16:59,995
- What are you talking about?

184
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,164
You're crazy.

185
00:17:04,034 --> 00:17:06,069
I didn't even try anything, did
I?

186
00:17:06,102 --> 00:17:07,670
- But, that's what you want,
isn't it?

187
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,107
A cute American girl.

188
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:13,043
Lost by herself in Paris.

189
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:14,144
You invite her over.

190
00:17:14,177 --> 00:17:16,513
- You're not lost by yourself in
Paris.

191
00:17:16,547 --> 00:17:17,790
You're the one who came up to
me.

192
00:17:17,814 --> 00:17:18,549
- Wrong again.

193
00:17:18,582 --> 00:17:19,750
You came up to me.

194
00:17:19,783 --> 00:17:21,818
- No, you're taking
hundreds of pictures of me

195
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:23,330
but that's not even the
fucking point, okay.

196
00:17:23,354 --> 00:17:25,098
- Fine, you want me to leave?
- [Florent] Shut your mouth.

197
00:17:25,122 --> 00:17:25,856
- I'll leave.

198
00:17:25,889 --> 00:17:28,359
- Shut your fucking mouth, okay.

199
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:29,794
Fucking crazy.

200
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,841
- Why would you let me in then,

201
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:37,935
if you don't know me

202
00:17:37,969 --> 00:17:39,504
and you don't wanna fuck me?

203
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:40,648
- I didn't say I didn't want to,

204
00:17:40,672 --> 00:17:41,839
I said I didn't try.

205
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,075
- See, there.

206
00:17:44,108 --> 00:17:44,609
- Don't push me.

207
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:45,643
- I knew it.

208
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:48,513
- Don't fucking push me.

209
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:07,733
(screaming)

210
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:14,473
(upbeat music)

211
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:59,720
(laid-back music)

212
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:41,564
(upbeat music)

213
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:58,481
(funky music)

214
00:22:17,526 --> 00:22:20,664
(laughing)

215
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:39,683
(laughing)

216
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:48,826
Come.

217
00:23:03,774 --> 00:23:06,311
(laughing)

218
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:16,087
- Look, I'm sorry about

219
00:23:17,923 --> 00:23:18,924
earlier.

220
00:23:23,695 --> 00:23:24,997
I was just upset

221
00:23:27,133 --> 00:23:27,934
and

222
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:29,368
- Let me show you something.

223
00:23:36,543 --> 00:23:37,544
Look.

224
00:23:43,015 --> 00:23:45,885
Quiet, peaceful.

225
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:00,501
(mumbling)

226
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:03,971
- I love that movie.

227
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:10,311
- Look, The Eiffel Tower.

228
00:24:12,946 --> 00:24:14,115
- [Alessia] So amazing.

229
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:17,351
- You know, it used to
be lit up all night.

230
00:24:18,686 --> 00:24:20,188
They changed it.

231
00:24:21,255 --> 00:24:22,256
- Why?

232
00:24:24,092 --> 00:24:26,495
- [Florent] 'Cause the world is
crazy.

233
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:37,606
What?

234
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,541
- Your breath stinks.

235
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:45,848
- So does yours.

236
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,003
- Hello?

237
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:44,342
Flo?

238
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:50,048
(bell ringing)

239
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:15,641
(bell ringing)

240
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,791
- Well, I'm the one who's sorry

241
00:26:21,815 --> 00:26:23,683
'cause I'm keeping the camera.

242
00:26:23,717 --> 00:26:24,718
- Fine.

243
00:26:28,488 --> 00:26:30,056
- Hey, wait.

244
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,090
Where you going?

245
00:26:32,392 --> 00:26:33,927
- Where are you right now?

246
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:38,332
Neither here nor there.

247
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:40,868
- What did you say?

248
00:26:41,802 --> 00:26:42,803
Hey.

249
00:26:43,904 --> 00:26:44,905
Hey.

250
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:46,440
Hey, wait.

251
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:48,709
- Hey.

252
00:26:50,244 --> 00:26:51,245
- What's up?

253
00:26:51,946 --> 00:26:53,948
- Nothing, do you ever sleep?

254
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:56,150
- What are you talking about?

255
00:26:56,184 --> 00:26:57,185
It's already one.

256
00:26:58,052 --> 00:26:59,120
- Shit, really?

257
00:27:00,921 --> 00:27:02,823
Hey, can we go some place?

258
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:04,459
I wanna see other parts of
France.

259
00:27:05,393 --> 00:27:06,594
- Okay.

260
00:27:06,627 --> 00:27:07,696
We can drive somewhere.

261
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:11,667
Hello.

262
00:27:29,986 --> 00:27:31,220
Okay.

263
00:27:31,253 --> 00:27:32,254
- Girlfriend?

264
00:27:33,189 --> 00:27:34,857
(laughing)

265
00:27:34,891 --> 00:27:36,358
(speaking French) American.

266
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,861
(laughing)

267
00:27:43,966 --> 00:27:44,967
- Ready?

268
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:47,304
- I was born ready.

269
00:27:47,337 --> 00:27:51,808
(upbeat music)

270
00:27:55,345 --> 00:27:56,880
So where are we going?

271
00:27:56,914 --> 00:27:58,749
- Oh, we're going to Deauville.

272
00:27:58,782 --> 00:28:00,918
It's in Normandie, you know
in the north of France.

273
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:02,653
It's a small beach town.

274
00:28:02,686 --> 00:28:03,697
My parents have a house there

275
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:05,255
so we have a place to stay.

276
00:28:06,223 --> 00:28:08,559
And, that's where the Americans
came to save the world.

277
00:28:10,261 --> 00:28:11,795
- You're so lucky.

278
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:12,830
- I'm lucky?

279
00:28:13,564 --> 00:28:15,046
Why, 'cause you're sitting in
the car?

280
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,535
- That and

281
00:28:17,568 --> 00:28:19,704
you live in a beautiful
apartment in Paris,

282
00:28:19,738 --> 00:28:22,774
your parents have houses
all over the place,

283
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:24,743
nice cars.

284
00:28:24,776 --> 00:28:25,944
You don't think you're lucky?

285
00:28:26,811 --> 00:28:27,479
- No, I'm lucky.

286
00:28:27,512 --> 00:28:28,747
You're right, I'm a lucky guy.

287
00:28:30,081 --> 00:28:31,149
- Yeah.

288
00:28:31,182 --> 00:28:32,184
Enjoy it.

289
00:28:33,185 --> 00:28:34,595
- You really wanna know what I
think?

290
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:35,854
- [Alessia] Of course.

291
00:28:35,887 --> 00:28:40,292
- You know how we, in
France, who live in a country

292
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:43,362
that has an amazing history,
right.

293
00:28:43,395 --> 00:28:47,032
Amazing philosophers and
artists,

294
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:50,603
writers and even politicians,
you know,

295
00:28:50,636 --> 00:28:53,506
human rights, the French new
wave

296
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:56,742
and cinema or French cuisine,

297
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,079
French baguette, wine and
cheese.

298
00:29:00,513 --> 00:29:02,115
I feel like we live in a place
that

299
00:29:02,148 --> 00:29:04,450
has a better past than future.

300
00:29:04,484 --> 00:29:06,486
It's like we're born at
the wrong time, you know.

301
00:29:07,754 --> 00:29:09,055
It's really frustrating.

302
00:29:11,057 --> 00:29:12,058
- Poor thing.

303
00:29:13,026 --> 00:29:15,596
- Come on, you can't
understand, you're an American.

304
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:16,963
- No, I do.

305
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:19,833
But, it's the same everywhere.

306
00:29:19,866 --> 00:29:21,202
I mean, look at the United
States.

307
00:29:21,235 --> 00:29:23,470
Everyone's saying the
American is presently dead.

308
00:29:23,504 --> 00:29:24,838
- [Florent] Come on, you can do

309
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:26,773
whatever you want in America.

310
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:29,343
- [Alessia] No, America runs on
money

311
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:31,245
and oil and that's it.

312
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:33,514
- [Florent] I see, so
you're one of those then?

313
00:29:33,547 --> 00:29:34,582
- [Alessia] One of what?

314
00:29:35,516 --> 00:29:37,685
- [Florent] Anti-globalization.

315
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:41,623
Communists, vegan, lesbian
activist.

316
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:43,525
You have tattoos all over your
butt.

317
00:29:46,528 --> 00:29:48,263
- Seriously though.

318
00:29:48,296 --> 00:29:52,234
Americans don't care
about art or philosophy.

319
00:29:52,267 --> 00:29:53,277
They don't know how to live.

320
00:29:53,301 --> 00:29:55,838
They work 60 hour weeks

321
00:29:55,871 --> 00:30:00,075
until finally they retire and
they never leave the country.

322
00:30:00,108 --> 00:30:02,044
And, there's a category for
everything.

323
00:30:02,911 --> 00:30:04,380
Like if I say occupy Wallstreet
then

324
00:30:04,413 --> 00:30:06,815
I'm a communist lesbian, like
you said.

325
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:08,684
Like, people are robots.

326
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:12,788
If you're Black or gay or Asian

327
00:30:12,821 --> 00:30:15,391
or Jewish or rich or poor

328
00:30:15,424 --> 00:30:17,293
than you should behave
like this or like that.

329
00:30:18,194 --> 00:30:20,163
But, what if you don't
fit into their categories,

330
00:30:20,196 --> 00:30:22,065
their tiny little boxes?

331
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:24,133
And, what if you don't want Sam
or Joe

332
00:30:24,167 --> 00:30:26,736
at Starbucks to ask you a
thousand times,

333
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,272
"How are you doing today,
ma'am?"

334
00:30:29,306 --> 00:30:30,540
'Cause you're pissed as fuck.

335
00:30:30,574 --> 00:30:31,741
You're having a shitty day.

336
00:30:31,775 --> 00:30:34,211
In Texas, they're like, "oh
hey, come around over here,

337
00:30:34,244 --> 00:30:35,679
"Cynthia can help you.

338
00:30:35,712 --> 00:30:37,057
"Cynthia can you check her out,
please?

339
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:38,148
"Can you run her up?"

340
00:30:40,017 --> 00:30:41,751
- I guess the grass is
always greener, huh?

341
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:44,722
- I love it.

342
00:30:46,256 --> 00:30:48,726
Are the French immune to lung
cancer?

343
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:50,728
I see French people drinking all
the time.

344
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:51,762
- [Florent] Yeah.

345
00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:53,638
- But, like only the
homeless people get drunk.

346
00:30:55,466 --> 00:30:57,067
Starbucks coffee sucks.

347
00:30:59,637 --> 00:31:04,542
(people talking)

348
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:20,392
Ew.

349
00:31:21,527 --> 00:31:22,528
Sand.

350
00:31:23,129 --> 00:31:24,997
- [Voiceover] Want some wine,
you want?

351
00:31:25,031 --> 00:31:26,698
You want some wine?

352
00:31:26,732 --> 00:31:27,733
- Please.

353
00:31:30,469 --> 00:31:31,470
Thank you.

354
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:36,876
Cheers.

355
00:31:41,648 --> 00:31:42,649
Cheers.

356
00:31:57,397 --> 00:31:59,079
- [Florent] Can you
pass the bread, please?

357
00:32:00,568 --> 00:32:01,401
Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you

358
00:32:01,434 --> 00:32:03,471
but Marion doesn't speak English
at all.

359
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,205
- Of course, I can speak
English.

360
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:09,810
- You're sounding fine to me.

361
00:32:09,843 --> 00:32:10,844
- What did she say?

362
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,720
- [Florent] See, told you.

363
00:32:15,917 --> 00:32:16,951
- So, where are we?

364
00:32:18,953 --> 00:32:19,954
- In Deauville.

365
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:21,756
And, you know what.

366
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,759
This is the place where they
wrote (speaking French).

367
00:32:24,793 --> 00:32:25,870
- [Florent] You know where the
Americans

368
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:27,896
landed during World War
II, like I told you before.

369
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:31,533
- Right here?

370
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:32,401
- No.

371
00:32:32,434 --> 00:32:33,067
- [Florent] No, it's close to
here.

372
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:34,503
There's a memorial.

373
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:35,846
If you want, we can go, it's
pretty nice.

374
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,372
I can take you.

375
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:38,888
- [Alessia] Wow, I'd love to see
that.

376
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:57,760
- What are you doing?

377
00:32:57,793 --> 00:32:59,028
What are you doing?

378
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:00,863
- [Florent] Yeah, she
does that all the time.

379
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,074
- No, no, wait, wait, stop,
stop, stop.

380
00:33:02,098 --> 00:33:03,099
What are you doing?

381
00:33:03,967 --> 00:33:04,634
No, please stop.

382
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,002
- Come on, you're beautiful.

383
00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:08,004
- [Marion] No, I'm not beautiful
at all.

384
00:33:09,606 --> 00:33:13,677
I will be very, very beautiful
with this.

385
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,787
- [Florent] Very beautiful,
- [Alessia] Yes.

386
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:15,345
Not sure.

387
00:33:15,379 --> 00:33:16,613
- I love the lipstick.

388
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:18,782
Very glamorous.

389
00:33:18,815 --> 00:33:20,584
- Let me get ready.

390
00:33:20,617 --> 00:33:21,818
(laughing)

391
00:33:21,852 --> 00:33:23,187
What?

392
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,221
- Get ready.

393
00:33:25,856 --> 00:33:26,323
What?

394
00:33:26,357 --> 00:33:27,892
- [Marion] God.

395
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:28,893
- Very glamorous.

396
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:29,927
- [Marion] Yeah?

397
00:33:37,802 --> 00:33:38,803
- Yeah.

398
00:33:39,404 --> 00:33:40,405
Wow.

399
00:33:42,507 --> 00:33:43,508
Yeah, come on.

400
00:33:47,245 --> 00:33:48,246
- Cheese.

401
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,185
Show me a picture.

402
00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:54,820
I want to see one.

403
00:33:54,853 --> 00:33:55,653
Just show me one.

404
00:33:55,688 --> 00:33:56,655
- No.

405
00:33:56,689 --> 00:33:57,355
- [Woman] I just want to see.
- [Alessia] No.

406
00:33:57,389 --> 00:33:58,056
Why no, it's me, you have to.

407
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:58,556
You have to.
- [Alessia] No.

408
00:33:58,591 --> 00:33:59,257
Show me just one.

409
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:00,526
- No, seriously.

410
00:34:04,497 --> 00:34:05,778
- [Florent] Hey, where you
going?

411
00:34:06,732 --> 00:34:07,842
- I'm just gonna go for a walk.

412
00:34:07,866 --> 00:34:08,767
- [Florent] Should I come with
you?

413
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:10,436
- [Alessia] No, it's okay.

414
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:12,505
I'm just gonna walk around a
little bit.

415
00:34:12,538 --> 00:34:13,572
- [Florent] Walk around?

416
00:34:13,606 --> 00:34:15,374
- Yeah, like, take some
pictures.

417
00:34:15,408 --> 00:34:16,475
You guys catch up.

418
00:34:17,944 --> 00:34:18,945
I'll be back soon.

419
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:21,280
'Kay.

420
00:34:24,083 --> 00:34:25,084
- Bye.

421
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:52,572
- Wow.

422
00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:54,540
This all looks so delicious.

423
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:00,981
I can eat these?

424
00:37:01,014 --> 00:37:01,547
- [Marion] Yeah.

425
00:37:01,581 --> 00:37:02,582
- [Florent] Of course.

426
00:37:04,885 --> 00:37:06,562
- So, did you also go
to the American school?

427
00:37:06,586 --> 00:37:07,587
- Me? no.

428
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:10,156
Normal school.

429
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:12,893
Public school for normal people.

430
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:16,109
- [Alessia] So, how did you guys
meet?

431
00:37:19,433 --> 00:37:21,368
- From long time.

432
00:37:21,402 --> 00:37:22,803
- We went to preschool together.

433
00:37:22,836 --> 00:37:23,570
- [Alessia] Really?

434
00:37:23,604 --> 00:37:24,505
- [Florent] Yeah.

435
00:37:24,538 --> 00:37:26,207
- I don't have any friends from
preschool.

436
00:37:30,544 --> 00:37:32,479
So, tell me something about
Florent

437
00:37:32,513 --> 00:37:34,048
that he would never tell me
himself.

438
00:37:41,756 --> 00:37:42,857
- He's very nice.

439
00:37:44,626 --> 00:37:46,461
He's very generous.

440
00:37:47,295 --> 00:37:49,364
He loves his friends.

441
00:37:49,397 --> 00:37:50,838
But, if you do something in his
back,

442
00:37:50,865 --> 00:37:53,201
he just stops speaking with you
forever.

443
00:37:53,235 --> 00:37:54,236
- Oh, really?

444
00:37:55,804 --> 00:37:58,607
- And, he's also very romantic.

445
00:37:58,641 --> 00:37:59,307
- That's not true.

446
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:00,543
I don't know why she's

447
00:38:00,576 --> 00:38:01,920
saying this, that's not true.
- [Alessia] That's so sweet.

448
00:38:01,944 --> 00:38:03,446
I don't know why she's saying
this.

449
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,148
- [Alessia] Okay, tell me more.

450
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:07,182
Tell me more.

451
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:10,619
- Oh, I have us a funny story
about him.

452
00:38:10,653 --> 00:38:11,654
Okay.

453
00:38:12,388 --> 00:38:13,789
- [Alessia] Yes, yes.

454
00:38:13,822 --> 00:38:14,490
Just what I want.

455
00:38:14,523 --> 00:38:15,724
- [Marion] We went to Iceland.

456
00:38:16,659 --> 00:38:18,421
- Can't believe you're
gonna tell this story.

457
00:38:21,965 --> 00:38:22,966
- [Alessia] Thanks.

458
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:26,269
- Especially to see whales.

459
00:38:26,302 --> 00:38:29,539
But, it just had (speaking
French).

460
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:30,574
- What, what?

461
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:33,009
(speaking French)

462
00:38:33,042 --> 00:38:33,877
- A total what?

463
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,679
- [Florent] Had a stiff neck.

464
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:38,148
- [Marion] Okay, because the
night before,

465
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,350
he was too drunk to go to his
bed

466
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,787
so he just slept on the floor
like this.

467
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:47,892
So, when we saw a whale,

468
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,494
he just couldn't see it.

469
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,797
So, it was so funny because in
four days

470
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,165
he never saw a single whale.

471
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,835
- You went all the way to
Ireland

472
00:38:57,868 --> 00:38:59,337
and you didn't see a single
whale?

473
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,672
- Iceland, not Ireland.

474
00:39:01,706 --> 00:39:02,607
- Same thing.

475
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,650
- I don't know why she's saying
all this.

476
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,076
She's crazy, seriously.

477
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,845
- 'Cause I love him very much.

478
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:10,916
So, now your turn.

479
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,383
Tell us something about you.

480
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:14,019
What are you doing here?

481
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,286
- Um.

482
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:20,025
Okay.

483
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:23,495
Well, um, I'm from Texas.

484
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:25,965
I'm 23 years old.

485
00:39:25,998 --> 00:39:29,735
And, I just studied
random stuff in the US.

486
00:39:31,137 --> 00:39:32,538
- What is random stuff?

487
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:34,493
- [Alessia] It's just you
make up your own major.

488
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:37,510
- Okay.

489
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,245
And?

490
00:39:39,278 --> 00:39:40,279
- And.

491
00:39:42,181 --> 00:39:43,350
And.

492
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:47,887
Oh, my mother just died.

493
00:39:57,097 --> 00:39:58,531
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

494
00:39:58,566 --> 00:39:59,967
You never said anything.

495
00:40:05,238 --> 00:40:08,176
- Yeah, it was her dream to come
to France

496
00:40:08,209 --> 00:40:10,178
and she never did so, here I am.

497
00:40:21,555 --> 00:40:23,357
- I'm sorry.

498
00:40:23,391 --> 00:40:24,325
- Yeah, we weren't that close.

499
00:40:24,358 --> 00:40:25,359
It's okay.

500
00:40:30,832 --> 00:40:32,066
- Still, she's your mom.

501
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,531
- [Florent] Should we
drink something, maybe?

502
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:46,348
So, you like oysters or shrimps
better?

503
00:40:46,381 --> 00:40:47,382
- The shrimp.

504
00:40:52,988 --> 00:40:55,625
- [Alessia] So, what's
there to do in Deauville?

505
00:40:57,527 --> 00:40:58,328
- Nothing.

506
00:40:58,361 --> 00:40:59,362
- Resting.

507
00:41:02,065 --> 00:41:03,066
- [Marion] I don't know.

508
00:41:05,601 --> 00:41:07,771
When do you go back to US?

509
00:41:07,804 --> 00:41:08,805
- I'm not sure.

510
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:09,840
Maybe I'll stay.

511
00:41:10,907 --> 00:41:12,669
- [Marion] You don't
want to see your family?

512
00:41:13,243 --> 00:41:14,244
- [Alessia] Not really.

513
00:41:16,947 --> 00:41:17,948
This is good.

514
00:41:19,049 --> 00:41:20,651
- Eat more, you're not eating
anything.

515
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,361
- [Alessia] Cheers.

516
00:41:30,394 --> 00:41:30,895
- Cheers.

517
00:41:30,928 --> 00:41:31,462
- Cheers.

518
00:41:31,495 --> 00:41:32,496
- Cheers.

519
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:42,807
- Please stop staring like this?

520
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,276
- That waiter's really cute.

521
00:41:47,279 --> 00:41:48,680
- I was thinking the same.

522
00:41:50,282 --> 00:41:52,050
- We should invite him over
here.

523
00:41:52,084 --> 00:41:53,405
- [Florent] Come on, he's
working.

524
00:41:54,152 --> 00:41:55,153
- So.

525
00:41:56,421 --> 00:41:58,556
- So, maybe I should go be the
waiter

526
00:41:58,591 --> 00:42:00,168
and then he could come
and sit with you guys,

527
00:42:00,192 --> 00:42:01,226
if that's what you want.

528
00:42:05,464 --> 00:42:07,065
- And, he's very jealous, too.

529
00:42:07,966 --> 00:42:09,087
- [Florent] That's not true.

530
00:42:17,443 --> 00:42:22,248
(laughing)

531
00:42:22,281 --> 00:42:23,950
- Come on, drink it up.

532
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:31,157
- What is this?

533
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,192
- Just let it be.

534
00:42:35,195 --> 00:42:37,064
(coughing)

535
00:42:44,805 --> 00:42:46,406
- This is so nice.

536
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:52,447
- What?

537
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,315
- Just do it.

538
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:57,252
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

539
00:42:57,285 --> 00:42:58,919
He wants us to leave.

540
00:42:58,953 --> 00:43:00,388
- Do you want me to do it?

541
00:43:00,421 --> 00:43:01,222
- [Marion] No.

542
00:43:01,256 --> 00:43:02,590
- Come on girls, listen, poor
guy.

543
00:43:02,623 --> 00:43:03,868
He probably just wants to go
home

544
00:43:03,892 --> 00:43:05,460
to his wife, I'm sure.

545
00:43:06,494 --> 00:43:08,363
You know, some girl he met in
high school

546
00:43:08,396 --> 00:43:11,399
when she like 16 and he got her
pregnant.

547
00:43:11,432 --> 00:43:13,001
- You really have imagination.

548
00:43:13,034 --> 00:43:15,537
- That's what they do on
the country side, right?

549
00:43:15,571 --> 00:43:16,472
- You should write a book.

550
00:43:16,505 --> 00:43:17,606
- Yes.

551
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,308
That's how I always tell him.

552
00:43:19,341 --> 00:43:21,310
- That's what I should do.

553
00:43:21,343 --> 00:43:22,844
I should be a writer.

554
00:43:22,878 --> 00:43:23,879
- I would read it.

555
00:43:23,912 --> 00:43:24,613
- [Florent] Okay.

556
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:25,047
- [Alessia] Do it.

557
00:43:25,081 --> 00:43:25,747
- That's it.

558
00:43:25,781 --> 00:43:27,083
And then, you can take pictures,

559
00:43:27,116 --> 00:43:28,684
you know, to promote the book.

560
00:43:28,717 --> 00:43:29,318
How do you call this?

561
00:43:29,351 --> 00:43:31,921
The cover of my book.

562
00:43:31,954 --> 00:43:33,623
- And, what do I do?

563
00:43:36,192 --> 00:43:37,093
(laughing)

564
00:43:37,126 --> 00:43:38,461
- You pose for the cover.

565
00:43:39,962 --> 00:43:40,997
- That's it?

566
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:42,207
- No, no, no, because, you know,

567
00:43:42,231 --> 00:43:45,335
you like talking so
fucking much all the time.

568
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:46,736
I know you should be a

569
00:43:48,271 --> 00:43:49,439
how do you say this?

570
00:43:49,472 --> 00:43:49,839
My...

571
00:43:49,872 --> 00:43:50,840
- Bitch?

572
00:43:50,873 --> 00:43:52,609
(laughing)

573
00:43:52,642 --> 00:43:54,377
- You can be my agent.

574
00:43:54,411 --> 00:43:55,578
- Book launch parties.

575
00:44:14,933 --> 00:44:16,167
- You should sit with us.

576
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:17,201
- Yes.

577
00:44:17,235 --> 00:44:18,712
- No, babe, it's okay, he wants
go home,

578
00:44:18,737 --> 00:44:19,470
we're gonna leave.

579
00:44:19,503 --> 00:44:20,204
- Come, one drink.

580
00:44:20,238 --> 00:44:21,239
- Don't worry.

581
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:27,078
- [Alessia] Have a drink,
have one drink, okay?

582
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:28,112
- Okay.

583
00:44:29,548 --> 00:44:31,049
- No, but go home.

584
00:44:31,082 --> 00:44:31,783
- [Waiter] I'll be right back.
- [Alessia] Everybody speaks

585
00:44:31,816 --> 00:44:32,617
English here.

586
00:44:32,651 --> 00:44:33,918
(laughing)

587
00:44:33,952 --> 00:44:34,786
- Yeah.

588
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:36,197
- I studied in Australia for a
year.

589
00:44:36,221 --> 00:44:37,222
- Good for you.

590
00:44:40,425 --> 00:44:42,294
- Aussie, Aussie, Aussie.

591
00:44:42,327 --> 00:44:43,495
Australia.

592
00:44:43,528 --> 00:44:44,196
- You guys want?

593
00:44:44,229 --> 00:44:44,897
- Yes.

594
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,899
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

595
00:44:46,932 --> 00:44:47,900
- [Marion] Stop.
- [Florent] My God.

596
00:44:47,933 --> 00:44:48,634
- More, more, more.

597
00:44:48,668 --> 00:44:49,268
- [Waiter] More?

598
00:44:49,301 --> 00:44:50,302
- Yeah, yeah, to the top.

599
00:44:52,505 --> 00:44:53,205
Yes.

600
00:44:53,238 --> 00:44:55,074
- Just a tiny little bit for me.

601
00:44:55,107 --> 00:44:55,775
- All the way.
- [Florent] That's enough.

602
00:44:55,808 --> 00:44:57,177
That's, no, I can't drink this.

603
00:44:58,144 --> 00:44:59,345
- You of all people.

604
00:44:59,379 --> 00:45:00,880
- I can't.

605
00:45:00,913 --> 00:45:03,016
- Cheers y'all.

606
00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:04,484
- Cheers.

607
00:45:04,517 --> 00:45:05,518
Okay.

608
00:45:11,191 --> 00:45:13,494
- So, what's your story?

609
00:45:16,096 --> 00:45:17,097
- I can't believe

610
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,932
you just broke the glass.
- [Waiter] My story.

611
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:26,107
That's really good news.

612
00:45:27,909 --> 00:45:29,070
- No thanks, I don't like it.

613
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:31,578
- Sorry, I didn't mean to.

614
00:45:31,612 --> 00:45:32,613
I don't know.

615
00:45:34,281 --> 00:45:35,683
Who am I?

616
00:45:35,717 --> 00:45:38,219
- No, no, no, no, we don't
wanna know who you are.

617
00:45:38,252 --> 00:45:40,988
We want you to tell us
a story about your life.

618
00:45:41,956 --> 00:45:43,090
- A story about my life.

619
00:45:46,228 --> 00:45:47,229
I don't know.

620
00:45:48,496 --> 00:45:50,198
Let's start at the beginning.

621
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:52,901
So, my name is Thomas, what's
you name?

622
00:45:52,935 --> 00:45:53,936
- Alessia.

623
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:54,436
- [Thomas] And, you?

624
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:54,970
- Flo.

625
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:55,670
- Marion.

626
00:45:55,704 --> 00:45:57,405
- Marion, okay.

627
00:45:57,439 --> 00:45:59,041
So, my name is Thomas

628
00:45:59,074 --> 00:46:01,009
and I'm a student.

629
00:46:01,043 --> 00:46:03,145
- [Florent] Student, lucky.

630
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:04,413
- [Alessia] I know.

631
00:46:06,682 --> 00:46:07,883
- Art history.

632
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:09,117
- I got that.

633
00:46:09,152 --> 00:46:11,320
- Really, look at you.

634
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:13,222
French is improving all of a
sudden.

635
00:46:14,891 --> 00:46:17,126
- And, you, what's your story?

636
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,361
Where are you from?

637
00:46:18,394 --> 00:46:19,729
You American?

638
00:46:19,763 --> 00:46:20,864
- Unfortunately.

639
00:46:20,897 --> 00:46:22,566
- [Florent] Smart one, too, huh.

640
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:23,700
It's not just a face.

641
00:46:25,234 --> 00:46:26,636
- [Thomas] Why unfortunately?

642
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:27,671
- Because

643
00:46:28,738 --> 00:46:30,106
there's nothing to do there.

644
00:46:30,974 --> 00:46:32,108
There's,

645
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:35,045
it's full of a

646
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:36,213
- Full of what?

647
00:46:36,246 --> 00:46:38,215
Come on, there is nothing to do
here.

648
00:46:38,248 --> 00:46:38,715
- Yes.

649
00:46:38,748 --> 00:46:39,884
- That's so true.

650
00:46:39,917 --> 00:46:40,818
There's nothing to do here.
- [Alessia] No, what about

651
00:46:40,851 --> 00:46:42,887
that thing, the museum you
talked about.

652
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,620
The World War II

653
00:46:43,653 --> 00:46:44,655
- Museum.

654
00:46:46,857 --> 00:46:48,068
- [Alessia] Yeah, yeah, that's
it.

655
00:46:48,092 --> 00:46:49,093
See.

656
00:46:59,804 --> 00:47:00,805
- Yes.

657
00:47:05,476 --> 00:47:06,477
- What

658
00:47:09,815 --> 00:47:11,650
- He will come with us to the
museum.

659
00:47:13,251 --> 00:47:13,719
- Oh yeah?

660
00:47:13,752 --> 00:47:14,152
- [Marion] Yeah.

661
00:47:14,185 --> 00:47:15,186
- Okay.

662
00:47:20,292 --> 00:47:21,293
- What?

663
00:47:21,793 --> 00:47:22,794
- But

664
00:47:23,762 --> 00:47:24,763
she goes

665
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:29,301
so

666
00:47:29,335 --> 00:47:33,072
(laughing)

667
00:47:35,107 --> 00:47:37,610
- He will come with us to the
museum.

668
00:47:37,644 --> 00:47:38,578
- Really?

669
00:47:38,611 --> 00:47:40,980
(laughing)

670
00:48:09,076 --> 00:48:10,444
- Okay guys.

671
00:48:10,478 --> 00:48:11,145
- What?

672
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:12,460
- My French isn't that good yet.

673
00:48:14,082 --> 00:48:15,984
- They're just talking about
some,

674
00:48:16,017 --> 00:48:17,298
what are you guys talking about?

675
00:48:19,487 --> 00:48:20,755
Oh, really?

676
00:48:20,789 --> 00:48:21,289
- Yeah.

677
00:48:21,322 --> 00:48:22,556
- Good for you.

678
00:48:22,591 --> 00:48:23,057
- Thank you.

679
00:48:23,091 --> 00:48:24,158
- Yeah, bullshit.

680
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,994
- Oh, I've done those.

681
00:48:26,027 --> 00:48:28,129
- Yeah, people don't want to
work anymore.

682
00:48:30,932 --> 00:48:34,336
This is what our problem is.

683
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,571
Now, we are old and we
understand that

684
00:48:37,639 --> 00:48:38,640
all is over.

685
00:48:39,808 --> 00:48:41,176
- I don't think this is a
problem.

686
00:48:44,613 --> 00:48:45,615
- Guys.

687
00:48:46,315 --> 00:48:47,516
We're understanding

688
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:50,486
that we're gonna die.

689
00:48:52,154 --> 00:48:56,192
(laughing)

690
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:01,911
- [Florent] We're understanding.

691
00:49:05,435 --> 00:49:06,669
- [Marion] We're going to die.

692
00:49:06,702 --> 00:49:09,139
Yes, we're going to die.

693
00:49:09,172 --> 00:49:10,173
- [Alessia] We all are.

694
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:14,344
He didn't like that, did he?

695
00:49:14,377 --> 00:49:15,412
- That was cute.

696
00:49:16,647 --> 00:49:17,681
- I love this music.

697
00:49:21,785 --> 00:49:23,087
Let's dance.

698
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,721
Come on, I want to dance.

699
00:49:24,755 --> 00:49:25,990
Okay.

700
00:49:26,023 --> 00:49:27,024
I want to dance.

701
00:49:29,226 --> 00:49:30,227
- No, no, no.

702
00:49:36,834 --> 00:49:37,702
No.

703
00:49:37,735 --> 00:49:39,937
No, seriously, stop pushing me.

704
00:49:39,971 --> 00:49:41,306
My God.

705
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:45,477

751
00:52:22,073 --> 00:52:23,775
- The traffic has jammed.

752
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:28,680
- Okay, okay, okay, so.

753
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:30,482
When was the last time you had
sex?

754
00:52:32,684 --> 00:52:33,285
- Are you talking to me?

755
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:34,753
- Yeah.

756
00:52:34,786 --> 00:52:37,489
You, everybody, Flo, I know, so.

757
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:38,057
- [Florent] Really?

758
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:39,058
- Yeah.

759
00:52:39,091 --> 00:52:40,101
- [Florent] I don't know
why she's saying this.

760
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:41,126
- Really?

761
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:42,928
So, when was it?

762
00:52:42,962 --> 00:52:45,798
- Um, few weeks ago.

763
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,768
- Days.

764
00:52:48,801 --> 00:52:50,135
- Really?

765
00:52:50,169 --> 00:52:51,270
- Why me, okay?

766
00:52:51,303 --> 00:52:52,304
What about you then?

767
00:52:53,873 --> 00:52:55,074
- With a guy or a girl?

768
00:52:55,107 --> 00:52:56,476
- Oh, interesting.

769
00:52:56,509 --> 00:52:58,644
- Wait, you really had sex with
a girl?

770
00:52:58,678 --> 00:52:59,712
- Of course.

771
00:53:03,016 --> 00:53:03,349
What?

772
00:53:03,383 --> 00:53:04,584
- Nothing.

773
00:53:04,617 --> 00:53:06,486
It's normal, you know.

774
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:07,888
You kiss a girl everyday.

775
00:53:09,555 --> 00:53:10,997
- Come on, you really never
tried it?

776
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:12,025
- No.

777
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,061
No,

778
00:53:15,562 --> 00:53:16,563
but I want to.

779
00:53:17,864 --> 00:53:18,899
- Really?

780
00:53:21,202 --> 00:53:22,563
- Maybe I could help you with
that.

781
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:30,832
- So, what about you Marion?

782
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,582
So?

783
00:53:39,421 --> 00:53:40,221
- Five months.

784
00:53:40,254 --> 00:53:41,255
- What?

785
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:44,091
- What?

786
00:53:45,427 --> 00:53:46,461
- Five months?

787
00:53:46,494 --> 00:53:47,862
- What, it's not so long.

788
00:53:49,331 --> 00:53:50,698
- I had sex last week.

789
00:53:50,732 --> 00:53:51,399
- Last week.

790
00:53:51,433 --> 00:53:52,067
- [Marion] But, you're a guy.

791
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:52,868
- [Thomas] And?

792
00:53:52,901 --> 00:53:53,735
- It's

793
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:55,270
- double standards.

794
00:53:55,303 --> 00:53:57,039
- Oh, congratulations, you win.

795
00:54:03,512 --> 00:54:04,513
- No.

796
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:07,350
- What?

797
00:54:08,351 --> 00:54:09,352
What?

798
00:54:10,453 --> 00:54:14,057
- Um, they want us to kiss.

799
00:54:15,424 --> 00:54:16,425
- You and me?

800
00:54:16,459 --> 00:54:17,794
- [Marion] They want to see us.

801
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:21,998
- Okay.

802
00:54:22,031 --> 00:54:23,112
What do we get in exchange?

803
00:54:25,969 --> 00:54:26,970
- Yeah, what do we get?

804
00:54:28,672 --> 00:54:31,575
- You get the experience
you've always wanted, right.

805
00:54:31,608 --> 00:54:33,577
Come on, you just said so.

806
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:34,611
And, you.

807
00:54:35,912 --> 00:54:39,049
- How bout you two kiss and then
we kiss.

808
00:54:39,083 --> 00:54:39,583
- Yeah.

809
00:54:39,616 --> 00:54:40,885
- [Florent] Us?

810
00:54:40,918 --> 00:54:41,751
- Yeah.

811
00:54:41,786 --> 00:54:45,522
You kiss her and then I kiss
Alessia.

812
00:54:45,555 --> 00:54:47,357
- Oh, okay, so you kiss her.

813
00:54:47,391 --> 00:54:47,992
- [Marion] No.

814
00:54:48,025 --> 00:54:48,559
- [Alessia] She meant him.

815
00:54:48,593 --> 00:54:48,959
- So?

816
00:54:48,993 --> 00:54:49,994
- No, no.

817
00:54:51,028 --> 00:54:52,196
- Okay.

818
00:54:52,229 --> 00:54:53,230
- Okay?

819
00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:00,571
- Come on, just a kiss.
- [Alessia] Yeah.

820
00:55:02,573 --> 00:55:05,143
- But, a real kiss or
else it doesn't count.

821
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:07,278
- [Florent] You guys are
such babies, seriously.

822
00:55:07,312 --> 00:55:08,546
- Oh yeah, we're the babies.

823
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:09,848
- Yeah.

824
00:55:09,881 --> 00:55:10,882
So?

825
00:55:11,617 --> 00:55:12,851
- Okay.

826
00:55:12,884 --> 00:55:13,351
- Okay.

827
00:55:13,384 --> 00:55:14,385
- [Florent] Okay.

828
00:55:18,324 --> 00:55:19,645
- Okay.
- [Alessia] Alright, then.

829
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,395
Go, go, go.

830
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:25,797
- But, then, you're turn.

831
00:55:27,934 --> 00:55:31,070
- My parents see what's
going on in their house?

832
00:55:31,103 --> 00:55:31,771
On their bed?

833
00:55:31,804 --> 00:55:33,840
- Who cares, their not here.

834
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:34,874
- [Florent] Alright.

835
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:41,981
- They're gonna do it.

836
00:55:47,587 --> 00:55:48,621
Come on.

837
00:55:48,655 --> 00:55:49,489
- That's nothing.

838
00:55:49,522 --> 00:55:50,991
- Okay, it's fine, your turn.

839
00:55:51,024 --> 00:55:53,927
- She's right, do not
pretend to be a prude.

840
00:55:53,961 --> 00:55:55,528
- I'm not a prude.

841
00:55:55,562 --> 00:55:56,830
- Come on, a real kiss.

842
00:55:57,698 --> 00:55:58,699
Okay, I guess you don't.

843
00:55:58,732 --> 00:55:59,567
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- [Florent] Come on.

844
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,303
(everyone speaking)

845
00:56:06,874 --> 00:56:07,875
- Do it.

846
00:56:09,177 --> 00:56:10,644
Yeah, come on guys.

847
00:56:10,678 --> 00:56:11,912
You can't screw me over.

848
00:56:35,036 --> 00:56:36,038
- Oh my God.

849
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:39,041
Unbelievable, Florent kissed
him.

850
00:56:39,074 --> 00:56:40,075
- Yeah.

851
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:42,945
- [Marion] I just can't
believe Florent kissed him.

852
00:56:45,881 --> 00:56:46,982
- [Thomas] Now, your turn.

853
00:56:47,016 --> 00:56:48,751
- [Florent] Okay, your turn,
your turn.

854
00:56:48,784 --> 00:56:49,452
- Okay.

855
00:56:49,485 --> 00:56:54,424
(soft rock music)

856
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,902
(crunching)

857
01:01:07,353 --> 01:01:10,190
(crunching)

858
01:01:10,223 --> 01:01:13,960
(chewing)

859
01:01:13,994 --> 01:01:16,330
(jingling)

860
01:01:16,363 --> 01:01:17,464
(crunching)

861
01:01:17,498 --> 01:01:18,532
(jingling)

862
01:01:20,534 --> 01:01:21,535
(sipping)

863
01:01:44,726 --> 01:01:46,007
So, are we going to that museum?

864
01:01:47,062 --> 01:01:48,796
- Oh yeah, yeah.

865
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:49,831
Forgot about that.

866
01:02:15,424 --> 01:02:20,429
(cheerful music)

867
01:02:31,241 --> 01:02:33,009
- [Thomas] This is real.

868
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:33,677
- [Florent] It's real?

869
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:35,212
- [Thomas] Yeah.

870
01:02:35,245 --> 01:02:36,113
- [Alessia] It's not a model?

871
01:02:36,146 --> 01:02:37,147
- [Thomas] No.

872
01:02:38,548 --> 01:02:39,649
- 45.

873
01:02:43,187 --> 01:02:43,954
- This is real?

874
01:02:43,988 --> 01:02:45,122
- Yeah.

875
01:02:45,155 --> 01:02:46,190
Everything's real.

876
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:06,277
- Can you imagine, tens of
thousands

877
01:03:06,311 --> 01:03:08,647
of men, literally in hell, at
the second

878
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:11,449
they step out of the boat,
they were just avoiding

879
01:03:11,482 --> 01:03:15,153
thousands of bullets, flying
right, left and center

880
01:03:15,186 --> 01:03:17,022
and some of them dying, just
like that.

881
01:03:34,006 --> 01:03:35,007
(puckering)

882
01:03:35,975 --> 01:03:36,976
(puckering)

883
01:04:08,242 --> 01:04:13,247
(happy music)

884
01:04:30,031 --> 01:04:33,101
- Like, you know how we keep
saying we're bored with life?

885
01:04:34,336 --> 01:04:36,058
We don't know what we're
gonna do next year.

886
01:04:36,771 --> 01:04:38,707
Well, by the time these
soldiers were pretty much

887
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,342
our age, they had something to
do.

888
01:04:41,176 --> 01:04:42,177
Something important.

889
01:04:43,445 --> 01:04:46,248
- So, for you, war is a good
thing?

890
01:04:47,382 --> 01:04:48,383
- That's not what I said.

891
01:04:49,785 --> 01:04:51,730
- Well, I guess war was a
good thing for the Americans

892
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:52,722
to do at that point, right?

893
01:04:52,755 --> 01:04:54,624
- No, no, no, that's
not what she's saying.

894
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:55,958
Go fight.

895
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:58,861
- I'm just saying that I wish
I had a purpose in my life.

896
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:02,532
- That's ridiculous.

897
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:05,101
So for you, you prefer to be,
like one of

898
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:06,970
the thousands of 22 years old
who died

899
01:05:07,003 --> 01:05:08,504
because of the government?

900
01:05:08,538 --> 01:05:09,873
- Just don't go in Iraq.

901
01:05:11,507 --> 01:05:12,943
- I didn't say I wanted to go to
war

902
01:05:12,976 --> 01:05:15,078
or that I think war is a good
thing.

903
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:16,656
Don't you think I think
war in Iraq was bullshit

904
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,482
driven by oil and money?

905
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:20,751
- No, you're just saying that
it's good

906
01:05:20,784 --> 01:05:22,786
because this people have
a purpose in their lives.

907
01:05:22,819 --> 01:05:23,863
But, come on, they didn't choose
it.

908
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:25,529
This is the government who tells
them that

909
01:05:25,556 --> 01:05:26,733
they need to fight for something
bigger

910
01:05:26,757 --> 01:05:28,826
or for liberty, whatever.

911
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,694
This is not the real
purpose these people die.

912
01:05:31,796 --> 01:05:33,765
- [Alessia] You're not getting
my point.

913
01:05:33,798 --> 01:05:35,079
- I'm totally getting your
point.

914
01:05:37,168 --> 01:05:38,335
- Les American, what?

915
01:05:38,369 --> 01:05:40,548
If you're gonna say it, use
English so I can answer you.

916
01:05:40,572 --> 01:05:42,807
- I just said, you're a
real American, that's it.

917
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:52,750
- [Alessia] Well, you should be
grateful

918
01:05:52,784 --> 01:05:54,195
because according to what we
just saw

919
01:05:54,219 --> 01:05:55,888
it's because of stupid Americans

920
01:05:55,921 --> 01:05:57,756
that we even live in this boring
town.

921
01:05:57,790 --> 01:05:58,800
- [Thomas] For sure, you're

922
01:05:58,824 --> 01:06:00,068
a stupid American.
- [Florent] Hey guys, guys.

923
01:06:00,092 --> 01:06:01,326
Can you calm down for a sec?

924
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:03,362
- Well, I'm just saying that
maybe

925
01:06:03,396 --> 01:06:05,698
being given a purpose, even if
it's fake,

926
01:06:05,731 --> 01:06:09,067
even if it means dying
when you're 22 as a hero,

927
01:06:09,101 --> 01:06:13,372
maybe this makes you happier
in life if you believe it.

928
01:06:13,406 --> 01:06:15,541
- You know what, why
don't you go to the army?

929
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:17,877
Why?

930
01:06:17,911 --> 01:06:19,054
- Actually, you know what,
that's true.

931
01:06:19,078 --> 01:06:21,147
If you care about it so
much, you're gonna ruin

932
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:22,882
our day over this.

933
01:06:22,916 --> 01:06:24,551
- I don't care about war.

934
01:06:25,819 --> 01:06:28,755
It's not my purpose, it's just a
purpose.

935
01:06:28,788 --> 01:06:31,124
God, maybe I should speak slower

936
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:33,026
so you can understand me better.

937
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:34,861
- Or, maybe if you were
able to speak French,

938
01:06:34,894 --> 01:06:36,430
we could understand you better.

939
01:07:12,734 --> 01:07:13,735
- Well.

940
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:15,804
Hey.

941
01:07:15,837 --> 01:07:16,838
What'd you just say?

942
01:07:19,841 --> 01:07:21,310
You're crazy, aren't you?

943
01:07:22,911 --> 01:07:24,913
- Oh, I'm crazy?

944
01:07:25,847 --> 01:07:27,559
You're the one who
suspiciously speaks English

945
01:07:27,583 --> 01:07:28,550
with no accent.

946
01:07:28,584 --> 01:07:30,328
You stole my camera and
you won't give it back

947
01:07:30,352 --> 01:07:32,621
until I go some place with you.

948
01:07:32,655 --> 01:07:34,256
And, you keep following me.

949
01:07:37,126 --> 01:07:40,062
- Well, okay.

950
01:07:40,096 --> 01:07:41,097
Yes.

951
01:07:41,898 --> 01:07:43,500
I guess you could see it this
way.

952
01:07:43,533 --> 01:07:44,534
Wait.

953
01:08:35,854 --> 01:08:40,592
(somber music)

954
01:08:54,073 --> 01:08:55,074
- You know what?

955
01:08:56,876 --> 01:08:57,877
We should get married.

956
01:08:59,479 --> 01:09:00,513
- What?

957
01:09:00,546 --> 01:09:03,950
- Yeah, that way, you can
come to the US and stay

958
01:09:03,984 --> 01:09:05,551
and I can make a political
statement.

959
01:09:09,122 --> 01:09:10,556
- You mean that way, you go jail

960
01:09:10,591 --> 01:09:12,526
and I get deported from the US
permanently

961
01:09:12,559 --> 01:09:14,060
and I can't re-enter ever.

962
01:09:15,195 --> 01:09:17,831
- Come on, people do it all the
time.

963
01:09:19,032 --> 01:09:20,534
- Very good plan.

964
01:09:20,567 --> 01:09:22,011
- Gay people can't get married
in the US

965
01:09:22,035 --> 01:09:23,837
so I'm gonna use my right to
make a point.

966
01:09:25,006 --> 01:09:27,008
- You're mixing everything up
right now.

967
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:28,042
- No, I'm not.

968
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:30,411
Think about it.

969
01:09:32,413 --> 01:09:33,490
- You want me to think about it,
really?

970
01:09:33,514 --> 01:09:34,749
- [Alessia] Yeah.

971
01:09:34,782 --> 01:09:35,783
- [Florent] Okay.

972
01:09:40,522 --> 01:09:44,091
And so, we get married
and then what happens

973
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:45,660
when you fall in love with
someone else

974
01:09:45,693 --> 01:09:47,362
and you can't get married to
that person

975
01:09:47,395 --> 01:09:48,796
'cause you're already married to
me?

976
01:09:49,965 --> 01:09:53,168
- Yes, I can, we can get a
divorce.

977
01:09:53,201 --> 01:09:58,206
(seagulls squawking)

978
01:10:10,986 --> 01:10:13,389
You know, my mom always
dreamed of coming to France.

979
01:10:15,158 --> 01:10:17,260
Of seeing the streets of Paris.

980
01:10:22,666 --> 01:10:23,733
She never did.

981
01:10:26,903 --> 01:10:28,772
I mean, I came.

982
01:10:28,805 --> 01:10:29,873
I saw Paris.

983
01:10:32,242 --> 01:10:34,411
And, she never had the guts to
come.

984
01:10:41,518 --> 01:10:43,220
And, now she can't.

985
01:10:43,253 --> 01:10:44,254
- Oh.

986
01:10:44,955 --> 01:10:45,956
Come here.

987
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:03,141
You know, that's also why

988
01:11:04,275 --> 01:11:05,811
them things don't work.

989
01:11:44,951 --> 01:11:45,852
- Where you going?

990
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:47,220
- [Florent] Home.

991
01:11:47,254 --> 01:11:48,255
- Already?

992
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:49,889
- [Florent] Yeah.

993
01:12:03,737 --> 01:12:08,609
(speaking French)

994
01:12:19,053 --> 01:12:21,856
k And my mind

995
01:12:21,890 --> 01:12:24,425
k In the far away here and now

996
01:12:25,359 --> 01:12:28,563
k I've become in control somehow

997
01:12:29,464 --> 01:12:33,168
k And I never lose my wallet

998
01:12:33,202 --> 01:12:35,504
k Because I

999
01:12:35,537 --> 01:12:38,540
k Will be the picture of
perception

1000
01:12:39,441 --> 01:12:42,177
k Never fucking up anything

1001
01:12:43,012 --> 01:12:47,650
k And I'll be a good defensive
driver

1002
01:12:47,683 --> 01:12:50,553
k And it's funny how I imagined

1003
01:12:50,586 --> 01:12:54,189
k That I would be that person
now

1004
01:12:54,223 --> 01:12:57,693
k But it does not seemed to have
happened

1005
01:12:57,727 --> 01:13:01,331
k Maybe I've just forgotten how

1006
01:13:01,364 --> 01:13:04,367
k To speak

1007
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:07,237
k And I'll never be the person

1008
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:10,641
k That I thought I'd be

1009
01:13:14,945 --> 01:13:18,014
k And my mind

1010
01:13:18,048 --> 01:13:21,552
k When I'm old I am beautiful

1011
01:13:21,585 --> 01:13:25,422
k Planting tulips and vegetables

1012
01:13:25,456 --> 01:13:29,326
k Which I will mindfully watch
over

1013
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,328
k Not like me now

1014
01:13:32,329 --> 01:13:35,933
k I'm so busy with everything

1015
01:13:35,967 --> 01:13:39,537
k That I don't know that
anything

1016
01:13:39,571 --> 01:13:44,176
k But I'm sure I'll look when I
am older

1017
01:13:44,209 --> 01:13:47,045
k And it's funny how I imagine

1018
01:13:47,079 --> 01:13:50,382
k That I could be that person
now k

1019
01:14:16,509 --> 01:14:17,543
- What's up sunshine?

1020
01:14:20,379 --> 01:14:21,380
- Hey.

1021
01:14:26,052 --> 01:14:27,293
Do you see my lighter anywhere?

1022
01:14:29,255 --> 01:14:30,257
- No.

1023
01:14:31,491 --> 01:14:33,460
(buzzing)

1024
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,822
- Can we go some place,
I need to get outta here.

1025
01:14:48,142 --> 01:14:49,143
- Okay.

1026
01:14:50,578 --> 01:14:51,646
Let me get dolled up.

1027
01:15:11,366 --> 01:15:13,434
(buzzing)

1028
01:15:16,538 --> 01:15:17,539
- Hey, it's Marion.

1029
01:15:19,808 --> 01:15:20,809
Hello.

1030
01:15:30,552 --> 01:15:32,922
She's really pissed
that we didn't say bye.

1031
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:50,007
Thomas doesn't wanna see her
anymore.

1032
01:15:51,741 --> 01:15:52,742
- So mean.

1033
01:16:29,581 --> 01:16:34,453
(laid-back music)

1034
01:19:39,045 --> 01:19:40,046
- [Florent] So?

1035
01:19:41,848 --> 01:19:43,216
My parents are coming back.

1036
01:19:48,121 --> 01:19:49,122
In a few days.

1037
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:00,701
What are you gonna do?

1038
01:20:06,507 --> 01:20:07,508
- I don't know.

1039
01:20:13,114 --> 01:20:14,635
- [Florent] Are you gonna go
back home?

1040
01:20:20,789 --> 01:20:25,627
(relaxing music)

1041
01:23:30,820 --> 01:23:32,254
- Put your hand on my leg.

1042
01:23:36,659 --> 01:23:37,860
Like I'm yours.

1043
01:24:20,204 --> 01:24:21,539
This city is so

1044
01:24:21,572 --> 01:24:22,473
amazing.
- [Florent] Be careful,

1045
01:24:22,506 --> 01:24:22,941
be careful.

1046
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:23,975
- Come on.

1047
01:24:24,976 --> 01:24:25,977
- I don't like this.

1048
01:24:27,512 --> 01:24:29,147
- You're so straight-laced.

1049
01:24:32,884 --> 01:24:34,052
I'm tired.

1050
01:24:34,086 --> 01:24:34,653
- [Florent] Wanna sit?

1051
01:24:34,686 --> 01:24:35,687
- Yeah.

1052
01:24:38,457 --> 01:24:39,458
There's bird shit.

1053
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:50,002
You know, think you look really
good.

1054
01:24:50,035 --> 01:24:52,318
You're like one of those guys
that looks good with makeup.

1055
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:56,075
Can I try something?

1056
01:24:56,108 --> 01:24:57,343
- If you want.

1057
01:24:57,377 --> 01:24:59,245
- Oh, you're the best.

1058
01:25:09,555 --> 01:25:10,724
- So, do you like Paris?

1059
01:25:11,658 --> 01:25:12,659
- Are you kidding?

1060
01:25:13,426 --> 01:25:14,895
I love Paris.

1061
01:25:16,129 --> 01:25:17,163
- Really?

1062
01:25:17,197 --> 01:25:18,899
- I could see myself living
here.

1063
01:25:18,932 --> 01:25:20,534
- Really?

1064
01:25:20,567 --> 01:25:21,568
- [Alessia] Really.

1065
01:25:22,569 --> 01:25:23,970
- So you need to get a place.

1066
01:25:26,707 --> 01:25:28,309
- Your hair's so thick.

1067
01:25:28,342 --> 01:25:29,743
It's crazy.
- [Florent] Alessia.

1068
01:25:30,945 --> 01:25:33,580
Right, I need to get a place.

1069
01:25:33,615 --> 01:25:34,696
- I can help you with that.

1070
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:36,183
- Right.

1071
01:25:36,217 --> 01:25:37,218
- Alessia.

1072
01:25:38,152 --> 01:25:39,153
- [Alessia] Right.

1073
01:25:40,355 --> 01:25:41,756
- Is that all you can say,
right?

1074
01:25:43,057 --> 01:25:44,335
- [Alessia] What do you want me
to say?

1075
01:25:44,359 --> 01:25:45,360
Left?

1076
01:25:45,393 --> 01:25:46,394
- No.

1077
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:49,871
- How 'bout you coming to The
States?

1078
01:25:50,632 --> 01:25:52,968
- Come on, we've been through
this.

1079
01:25:53,001 --> 01:25:53,802
I can't go to The States.

1080
01:25:53,836 --> 01:25:55,637
I don't have a Visa for The
States.

1081
01:25:55,670 --> 01:25:56,912
- I don't have a Visa for here.

1082
01:25:58,974 --> 01:25:59,975
- Yeah, right.

1083
01:26:06,749 --> 01:26:08,231
If we get married then you could
stay.

1084
01:26:11,854 --> 01:26:12,621
You're the one who said it.

1085
01:26:12,655 --> 01:26:13,556
Don't give me that look.

1086
01:26:13,589 --> 01:26:15,424
- Come on, I was upset.

1087
01:26:15,458 --> 01:26:16,960
- Oh, you were upset.

1088
01:26:16,993 --> 01:26:17,994
- [Alessia] Yeah.

1089
01:26:22,566 --> 01:26:24,568
- You must really think I'm an
idiot, huh?

1090
01:26:30,173 --> 01:26:31,695
So what now, you're just gonna
go home?

1091
01:26:32,642 --> 01:26:34,003
- I didn't say I was gonna go
home.

1092
01:26:36,146 --> 01:26:37,047
- What did you say?

1093
01:26:37,081 --> 01:26:38,748
- I didn't say I was gonna go
home.

1094
01:26:51,462 --> 01:26:52,463
What are you doing?

1095
01:26:54,365 --> 01:26:55,366
Ouch.

1096
01:26:58,236 --> 01:26:59,237
- Ow.

1097
01:27:02,407 --> 01:27:03,408
Ow.

1098
01:27:04,042 --> 01:27:04,876
- [Alessia] I'm sorry.

1099
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:06,071
- [Florent] That really hurt.

1100
01:27:07,012 --> 01:27:08,013
- I'm sorry.

1101
01:27:10,616 --> 01:27:11,783
Come here.

1102
01:27:11,817 --> 01:27:12,818
Come here.

1103
01:28:21,222 --> 01:28:22,423
- Okay, here's your camera.

1104
01:28:23,925 --> 01:28:24,926
Take it.

1105
01:28:33,568 --> 01:28:34,936
Where you rushing to anyway?

1106
01:28:36,038 --> 01:28:37,872
- I'm not rushing.

1107
01:28:37,906 --> 01:28:39,208
I'm exploring.

1108
01:28:43,312 --> 01:28:46,682
- Well, actually, I am from
here.

1109
01:28:46,716 --> 01:28:48,050
So, I could show you around.

1110
01:31:37,994 --> 01:31:42,532
