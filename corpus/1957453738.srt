00:00:00,397 --> 00:00:03,897
(movie reel intro screen)

2
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:11,410
(R&B music begins)

3
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,447
- Everything will be just fine.

4
00:02:23,447 --> 00:02:24,614
- Thanks babe.

5
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,694
- You welcome.

6
00:02:27,694 --> 00:02:28,560
But we do need to get ready

7
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,950
for your mother's 50th birthday party.

8
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,153
Our plane leaves soon.

9
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,023
- About that...

10
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:37,663
you sure you ready to meet my family?

11
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:42,663
- Yeah, I mean, how bad could it be?

12
00:02:43,468 --> 00:02:45,245
- All right (hesitantly).

13
00:02:45,245 --> 00:02:48,078
(R&B music plays)

14
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,863
- Baby! Yo man is hungry!

15
00:03:07,863 --> 00:03:09,910
I'ma go over there to Joe's Rib Shack

16
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,011
and spend yo birthday with them.

17
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:14,059
- Just go on down to the Rib Shack.

18
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:16,560
And you goin' miss out on greens, yams,

19
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,940
and my famous macaroni and cheese

20
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,150
and trust me, it will be worth the wait.

21
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,690
- I'm sure it will be,
but let me ask you...

22
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:28,442
is that cornmeal on yo fingers?

23
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,685
(both laughing)

24
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:31,392
No, just let me get the
cornmeal off your fingers.

25
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:34,016
- Cut it out, you play too
much, stop, oohhh ooohh.

26
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,164
- Let me lick the cornmeal off ya fingers.

27
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:39,509
- [Flo] You play too much (indistinct)!

28
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:42,176
(phone ringing)

29
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,920
Hello.

30
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,692
Oh, hi baby! How you doing?

31
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,309
Oh, you're almost here?

32
00:03:49,309 --> 00:03:52,786
Good! Okay, so what time
does your plane land?

33
00:03:52,786 --> 00:03:53,619
- Who dat!?

34
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:55,050
- Shhhhh!

35
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,880
Of course the invitation still stands,

36
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,600
honey we'd be happy to have
you over for dinner Lisa.

37
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,830
- Invitation? There's no invitation.

38
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,663
- Yes.

39
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:04,040
Six o'clock...

40
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,293
I'll see you then. All
right. Merry Christmas, baby.

41
00:04:08,993 --> 00:04:09,826
- Um. Um hmm...

42
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,620
- What?

43
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,190
- Flo, you know better.

44
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,449
Stop playin' matchmaker.

45
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:17,440
- I'm not!

46
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,430
- Um hm.

47
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,630
- Well, maybe just a little.

48
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,463
(R&B music plays)

49
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,246
- Mom Johnson.

50
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:55,718
Jonas Johnson.

51
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,940
- That boy can make his
own decisions about love.

52
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,080
You know, I did and look what it got me.

53
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,777
Fine fox like you and I didn't
need no help (chuckles).

54
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,832
Yeah, smooth as silk, I was, 'member?

55
00:05:12,832 --> 00:05:13,665
- Um hm.

56
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:15,083
- Pretty Ricky's what they call me.

57
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:18,495
(both laughing)

58
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:19,900
- Thank you, sweetie,

59
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,307
but Jonas is my baby

60
00:05:21,307 --> 00:05:24,580
and I know what's best for
him even when he doesn't.

61
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:29,523
Besides it's my birthday and
I can do what I wanna do!

62
00:05:29,523 --> 00:05:30,550
(both chuckling)

63
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,763
- You sure can, baby.

64
00:05:31,763 --> 00:05:34,430
(both laughing)

65
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,233
- Hey.
- Hey.

66
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,923
- Hello.

67
00:05:43,923 --> 00:05:45,700
- [Hair Client] (indistinct)
I can't believe you

68
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,773
finally goin' bring yo
(indistinct), hold on.

69
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,880
So, you just goin' open the garage,

70
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,998
so Pookie and 'nem can
see me gettin' a weave?

71
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:56,577
- Girl, it's hot in here.
- I can't with the garage!

72
00:05:56,577 --> 00:05:57,662
- It's hot in here!

73
00:05:57,662 --> 00:05:59,300
If you don't like it, you
can go to another salon.

74
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,330
- Now, you know I ain't goin
find nobody else to do my hair

75
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,950
for $15 a track.

76
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,650
- Right, you get what you pay for.

77
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,530
- Hey girl, I'm back,
more hood chronicles.

78
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,010
So, I was shocked to see that you're going

79
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,260
to the little party!

80
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,875
- I was shocked when I received an invite.

81
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,820
- (chuckles) Why? You know the Johnson's

82
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,620
have always treated you like family.

83
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:20,700
- I mean, we're pretty close

84
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,893
and Mrs. Johnson only turns 50 once.

85
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,160
- Yeah, you know Jonas is goin' be there.

86
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,610
- Have you forgotten?
It's football season,

87
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,330
so he won't be there.

88
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,120
- Apparently, you don't watch the news.

89
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,670
Jonas was injured and he
hasn't played in months.

90
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,920
Rumor is he will never play again,

91
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,230
girl you know them football
players get cut left and right.

92
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:43,773
- Wow, I have to admit I'm
not much of a sports fan,

93
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:46,600
but I'm sure he'll be
here with his teammates

94
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,220
and besides his mom knows better

95
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,930
than to put us in the same room together.

96
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,500
- Why the hell would she
have a birthday party

97
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,173
and not invite her son?

98
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:56,989
- I don't know! Less drama maybe.

99
00:06:56,989 --> 00:06:58,080
- (laughing) Yeah.
- You know it's been a long

100
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,333
time since the family's come together.

101
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,940
- That girl's not family, Flo.

102
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,350
She's an X-Factor, that's what she is.

103
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,570
- She's a long time family
friend and that's close enough.

104
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,080
- You heard me, let the
chocolate love connection

105
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,103
take care of that.

106
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,933
- Look, I just think they let
some things get in the way.

107
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,170
They still didn't help
gettin' back together.

108
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,930
- I hear he's quite the celebrity athlete,

109
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,450
my mom said he, shuts the
whole city down when he visits.

110
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:31,360
- [Hair Client] Yeah
and every time I see him

111
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,110
he has a different girl on his arm.

112
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:37,273
- Um, he has changed.

113
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:39,610
- That he has, but he's just going through

114
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,443
all those counterfeits,

115
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:42,540
so that he can find his way back to you.

116
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,010
- It'll be just fine.

117
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,141
You know how I know?

118
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:46,040
- How do you know?

119
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,096
- Because whatever God's will is

120
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:49,077
- Um.
- be!

121
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:50,460
- Um!
- And if it's not meant

122
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,690
to be, no worries.

123
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:56,179
- Hmm, now, did you say God's will?

124
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:57,020
- Um hm.

125
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,600
- Well, if that be the case,

126
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,750
why are you dippin' Flo?

127
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,750
God don't need yo help!

128
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,923
You wrong, Flo.

129
00:08:03,923 --> 00:08:07,000
- Oh baby, I just like seein' people happy

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,851
like you and I, that's all.

131
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:11,006
(both show each other affection)

132
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:15,210
- Um hmm, well, if they have a chance

133
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,577
for a fraction of what you and I have,

134
00:08:17,577 --> 00:08:19,977
then I guess it's nothing wrong with that.

135
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:22,790
(both laughing)

136
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,853
You think maybe later we can do that thing

137
00:08:25,853 --> 00:08:27,500
that we said we'd do once a year?

138
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,123
You know, 'round...

139
00:08:29,123 --> 00:08:30,223
- On your birthday!

140
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,023
Today is my birthday, Johnny.

141
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:35,923
- Oh yeah.

142
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:42,799
(R&B music plays)

143
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:47,300
- It's me again, James
Brown, work for the people

144
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,500
and I feel good!

145
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,333
- Come on in.

146
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,430
- Thank you Mr. Johnson,
how are you today, sir?

147
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:57,940
- I was doing good, I was.

148
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,773
Come on in.

149
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,590
- I doubt that, I mean,

150
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,890
he finally has what he's always wanted

151
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,910
and that's fame and fortune.

152
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,500
Something, I never really
too much cared for.

153
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,630
Well, except for the
fortune part (laughs)!

154
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,550
- Girl, you better do like everybody else

155
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,200
and open you up a little boutique.

156
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,907
Have him pay for it, he good for it.

157
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:20,180
You better get him before he
spend the rest of that money

158
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,140
on them white girls.

159
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,433
Stop! Being rough, girl
let me call you back,

160
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:25,440
I'll see you in a minute.

161
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,987
Why you gotta be so rough!?

162
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:32,827
- (chuckles) Crazy, old Danny (chuckles).

163
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,640
- And y'all ain't got nothin' else to do?

164
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,600
You ain't got nobody to kill?

165
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,720
Nobody to rough up?

166
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,300
You just goin' stare at me?

167
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,700
Oh, y'all just still goin' look?

168
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,250
Y'all ain’t never seen nobody get weave?

169
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,880
I know I've been sayin'
this my hair for years,

170
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,243
but it is, but it ain't.

171
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,880
- It's a lot to look at,

172
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,681
like all head.
- What you talkin' about?

173
00:09:53,681 --> 00:09:56,050
- And tell your little girlfriend
that this is my real hair,

174
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,010
'cause I know she be asking.

175
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,163
Stop, bein' so rough!

176
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,560
That's why you get fired from every salon.

177
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,880
I'm the last customer you got!

178
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,220
- You can get out my garage
if you don't like it.

179
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:08,120
- And then how you goin` pay your rent?

180
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,300
- I like the hood.

181
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:15,963
You know those white people
don't need me in the suburbs.

182
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:21,833
- Sir, I understand it can be
hard to let go and move on,

183
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,063
but it'll be better, don't you think?

184
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,170
- Listen, James,
- James (indistinct).

185
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,889
- that's the problem with some people,

186
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:33,690
they get a little money and they forget

187
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,690
about the community that they came from.

188
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,373
I'm not selling!

189
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:49,494
(R&B music begins)

190
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,221
- Whoo!

191
00:11:16,221 --> 00:11:17,212
- Oh man!

192
00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:19,053
Um! Tastes like victory.

193
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,610
So, you thought more about what I said?

194
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:25,966
About being down with the set?

195
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,630
- I don't know man, it
just seems kind of...

196
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,290
- Yo! Forget about tryin' to get that

197
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,510
basketball scholarship!

198
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,343
What! Why are you wasting your time

199
00:11:34,343 --> 00:11:35,883
on an empty dream anyways?

200
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:39,000
You never goin' be like your brother.

201
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,290
So stop livin' in the shadows.

202
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,180
- Why are you bringing up Jonas?

203
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,090
For real, you know I hate that man.

204
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:47,890
I get it, I'm not like him, I
don't need you reminding me.

205
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,763
Just drop it man.

206
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:51,139
- All right, man.

207
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,625
- Ugh man...

208
00:12:00,532 --> 00:12:01,460
It's Jonas, man.

209
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,433
Hold on.
- Aight man.

210
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,540
- Yo, what's up?

211
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,160
- Big dog! Hey little bro.

213

- I'm busy man, what do you want?

214
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,440
- Oh you busy (chuckles)?

215
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,220
Just lettin' you know comin' in town.

216
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,570
- I mean, cause we never see you,

217
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,401
but your name is the most
talked about in the house.

218
00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:28,090
- Aye, well I miss y'all too man.

219
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,900
Now in fact look, keep it under wraps

220
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,260
I'm comin' in town soon.

221
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,123
Wanna spend some quality
time wit' you and the family.

222
00:12:34,123 --> 00:12:35,320
Aight?

223
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,523
- Yeah, aight superstar, bye!

224
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,563
- Hello?

225
00:12:50,843 --> 00:12:52,260
- Thank you, man.

226
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:55,357
That's my little brother.

227
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,795
- I'm down.

228
00:13:00,795 --> 00:13:02,245
- That's what I like to hear.

229
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:11,184
- ♪ Go tell it on the mountain, ♪

230
00:13:11,184 --> 00:13:15,577

231
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:19,044

(humming)

235
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:36,423
(dramatic music begins)

236
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,910
- Felt the house kinda
rockin' when you came in.

237
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,760
- Hmm!

238
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,630
- Happy birthday mama.

239
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,773
- Thank you baby!

240
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,983
- So, how do you feel?

241
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:59,210
- Baby, I'm good. I am so

242
00:13:59,524 --> 00:14:00,680

243
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,530
Can't believe it. Made
all his favorite stuff.

244
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,180
Oohh! It's gonna be a party.

245
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,686
Oh just, God is just so good!

246
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:10,756
I couldn't ask for more!

247
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:11,619
Ooohhh and if it got any better

248
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:13,160
I'd be jealous of myself.
- Mom, I'ma go shower,

249
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,993
all right?

250
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:14,830
- Okay baby.
- I'll talk to you later,

251
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,633
all right?
- Um hm, okay.

252
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:18,800
(humming)

253
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,520
- Like your taxes and
that ring around your car,

254
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,640
I'ma always be around.

255
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:30,230
- Listen, I'm big daddy 'round here.

256
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:34,653
I pay all the bills up and around here.

257
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,110
You're here, 'cause I let you be.

258
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:41,764
- Oh! So you're big man in charge.

259
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:42,840
- You lookin' at him.

260
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,057
- Oh, well if you're
the big man in charge,

261
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:48,510
why don't you stop poppin
them little blue pills

262
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,430
to get yourself goin'?

263
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,920
- Flo! You told her about that!?

264
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,530
- She told me. We are girls!
We don't keep secrets.

265
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,470
She told me something else too.

266
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,409
She said without them little blue pills,

267
00:15:00,409 --> 00:15:02,724
you ain't nothin' but the two minute man.

268
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:03,707
Two minutes.

269
00:15:03,707 --> 00:15:05,614
- What! You told her about that?

270
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:06,447
- [Barbara] (laughing)

271
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:11,447
- Well sometimes, sometimes
all Johnny need is two minutes.

272
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,209
- [Johnny] That's right! That's right!

273
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:15,900
- I see, (indistinct) two
minutes man, the two minutes man,

274
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,737
two minutes, two and two.

275
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:20,710
- Is anything sacred in this house?

276
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,673
- Barb! Hush it up, now!

277
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,067
- In two minutes (laughing)!

278
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:32,790
Two and two, two and two, you
got that old medicated love.

279
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,590
Two and two, two, two, two,
two, two, two (laughing).

280
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:40,391
Two and two, two and two, two, two,

281
00:15:40,391 --> 00:15:42,474
two, two and two and two!

282
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,094
- That heffer has got to
get out of this house.

283
00:15:48,094 --> 00:15:51,344
(Hip hop music begins)

284
00:16:18,386 --> 00:16:19,886
- They need to trade that boy.

285
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,030
He ain't good for nothing!

286
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,203
Hey, wait a minute.

287
00:16:31,203 --> 00:16:32,343
Baby, this that fool keep talkin' to me

288
00:16:32,343 --> 00:16:34,620
about selling my house.

289
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,750
Jonas keep sending him over here.

290
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,419
Talkin' about, "We need
to move out of the hood."

291
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:45,419
This house is bought
and paid for (chuckles).

292
00:16:45,498 --> 00:16:46,353
- Sis, you remember that song

293
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:48,517
that we used to sing when we was kids?

294
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:49,397
- You mean the one that (laughing)

295
00:16:49,397 --> 00:16:51,097
we got in so much (indistinct) in?

296
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:55,363

when mama used to whoop
my tail (laughing)!

313
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:44,970
- Girl, I stayed in
some mess (indistinct).

314
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,659
- I tried to be like you.

315

This is Johnny. Yeah,
yeah jolly, yeah, yeah,

319
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,840
she's fine, she's fine.

320
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,410
Listen, I know you're still heartbroken

321
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:13,955
over the recent loss of
your dearly beloved wife,

322
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:15,950
but Charlie I think it
might be time for you

323
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,390
to get back on that horse...

324
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,090
or should I say that cow?

325
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,540
Now look here, I got
somebody I want you to meet.

326
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,150
Well, she's a little hard
on the eyes, Charlie.

327
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,983
Booty!?

328
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,420
She got two booties, Charlie.

329
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,155
She got a booty in the
back, booty in the front.

330
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:46,819
(chuckles) Just like you like 'em.

331
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:48,739
Yes, sir (chuckles)!

332
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:50,800
Look here, why don't you come
over to my house tonight?

333
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,420
Around 6:00 p.m.

334
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,910
Yeah.

335
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,063
Yeah! I still live in a hood, yeah.

336
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,860
All right, I'll see you then.

337
00:19:05,112 --> 00:19:10,112
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes
Lord, yes Lord! Jesus!

338
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,894
Stayin' here over my dead body (chuckles).

339
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:17,123
- Oh, so that's something, that's funny,

340
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:21,220
because that's the same thing
that my second dead husband

341
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,343
used to say and now he's dead!

342
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,010
- You here this? That's
practically an admission!

343
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,290
Listen you two.
- Come on now, you know

344
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,123
(indistinct).

345
00:19:29,123 --> 00:19:31,330
- (laughing)

346
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,970
- We are family, ain't
nobody goin' nowhere.

347
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,417
Families stick together no matter what

348
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:41,350
and can we please just have
one day outta the year,

349
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,042
where you two don't fight!?

350
00:19:43,042 --> 00:19:44,633
- No!
- Demon breath.

351
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:47,350
- I ain't no kin to that!
- I can't stand him, uh uh.

352
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,850
- You tell me she's some kin,

(R&B music begins)

432
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:06,975

453
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,973
(screams) See, I knew you

454
00:24:16,973 --> 00:24:17,940

460
00:24:30,818 --> 00:24:32,130
Girl, I'm so excited.

461
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,720
Oh, girl this just my

462
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,853
He must owe Boogie some money.

463
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,197
Don't be scared.

464
00:24:41,197 --> 00:24:42,030

474
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,660
Do you owe Boogie some money?

475
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,050
I better not find out

476
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:08,000

- No thanks though, where's your restroom?

492
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,093
- Right down the hall.

493
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,713
Don't use the good towels.

494
00:26:00,713 --> 00:26:01,613
- Barbara, please.

495
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,262
- Why can't she use the good towels?

496
00:26:07,262 --> 00:26:08,095
I use the good towels.

497
00:26:08,095 --> 00:26:11,170
- Hmm, from the looks of
the strains on your shirt,

498
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,113
I could've swore you was using your shirt!

499
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:18,410

(R&B music begins)

502
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,763
- You look real familiar.

503
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,130

510
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,370
What's that got to do wit anything?

Why in the hell would you be in here

515
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,220
Must be crazy.

00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,520
- Well, that's just it. That's his paper.

517
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,430
Ready to make my own and make

518
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:19,430
- Okay, hmm, I can dig it.

- Boss?

526
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,417
- Pour me a drink, man.

527
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:49,723
- You got it, boss.

528
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,540
- Is this the reason why you
don't come around anymore?

529
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,150
- Nah, ma, you know I'm used to it.

530
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:55,270
I do worry about Jasmine,

531
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,233
she hasn't been around
this type family before.

532
00:27:58,233 --> 00:28:00,500
(indistinct) you think about
her man, she's fine, right?

533
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,500
- Who her? Well, I mean, if you
like skin and bones, I mean,

534
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,860
she just looks like the type of girl

535
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,273
if you rubbed up against
her, she'd start a fire.

536
00:28:13,273 --> 00:28:14,573
(chuckling) a little twig!

537
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:18,030
- She remind me of one of them
monster high (indistinct).

538
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,481
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

539
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:21,447
- I felt sorry for her. I
wanted to hug her again.

540
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:25,757
"Listen here baby, you can
eat, here's a chicken wing."

541
00:28:25,757 --> 00:28:27,395
Here is a chicken wing.

542
00:28:27,395 --> 00:28:29,150
(laughing)

543
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:32,530
- I agree with all of that,
just don't you hug her.

544
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:34,463
You'll suffocate the poor thing.

545
00:28:36,676 --> 00:28:37,998
- Get out of here.

546
00:28:37,998 --> 00:28:42,320
- Son, I'm the type of brother,

547
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,013
like a little meat on this bones.

548
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,910
You see, I'm from the dirty south.

549
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,110
- Wit' a funky mouth.

550
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,478
- Shave your armpits!

551
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,790
(laughing)

552
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,817
Listen son!

553
00:28:53,817 --> 00:28:56,185
- I'm listenin pops.

554
00:28:56,185 --> 00:28:58,080
- A brother like me, likes a woman

555
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,440
that I can cuddle up to
her in the winter time

556
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,203
and keep warm.

557
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,063
Big booty!

558
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:09,669
- Come on.

559
00:29:09,669 --> 00:29:10,897
- You understand what I'm sayin'?

560
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,980
Like your mother.

561
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,040
- Pause pops, that's too
much information, okay?

562
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,610
- Yes, well, it's how you got here.

563
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:21,893
- Okay, pops.

564
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,210
- Son, there's so much more to a woman

565
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,500
than just how she looks.

566
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,330
- Now, I know pops, so
besides that, you know,

567
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,580
she is a good woman,
comes from a good family,

568
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:36,510
she supports me and more
importantly pops, it's no drama.

569
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,400
- No drama?
- No drama, no backtalk,

570
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,673
no lip.

571
00:29:39,673 --> 00:29:44,673
- No lip!? Wait, wait.

572
00:29:45,697 --> 00:29:47,210
No lip?

573
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,137
Son, I don't even know
what that feels like.

574
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:51,010
I don't know what it feels like,

575
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,793
I don't know what it sounds like.

576
00:29:52,793 --> 00:29:54,254
- Quiet.

577
00:29:54,254 --> 00:29:56,070
- Quiet. Man, yo mama

578
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:57,920
sleeps wit' her fists balled up at night

579
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,353
in case I start something.

580
00:29:59,353 --> 00:30:01,580
- And that's what I'm
talkin about pops, exactly.

581
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,980
Jasmine and I, we don't
fight, we don't argue.

582
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,460
There's no drama, she...
- What you say?

583
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,293
- She's perfect.

584
00:30:10,286 --> 00:30:13,193
- (chuckles) There no perfect women's son.

585
00:30:14,989 --> 00:30:16,863
- Maybe, but she's close.

586
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,089
- Well, yeah, that's what
you said about the last one

587
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:22,956
wasn't it? Yeah, and the one before that.

588
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:23,789
- Yes!

589
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:24,720
- The woman before that,
- [Barbara] Right!

590
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,700
- Wasn't it? What happened
to that white girl

591
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,040
you brought here a couple of summers ago?

592
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,940
- Can you stop with the
white girl talk, it's Amy,

593
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,360
her name is Amy.

594
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,850
- Amy!? Boy, I don't
care what her name is!

595
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,622
She can't use our comb,
why'd you bring her home?

596
00:30:37,622 --> 00:30:38,967
(everyone laughs)

597
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:41,078
- But do y'all remember that Asian girl?

598
00:30:41,078 --> 00:30:43,392
- Yeah, yeah, yeah (laughing)!

599
00:30:43,392 --> 00:30:44,715
- That poor thing honey, she thought the

600
00:30:44,715 --> 00:30:47,853
chitlins was pasta.
- Yes she did! Yes she did.

601
00:30:47,853 --> 00:30:49,900
- That was crazy, you
know she broke up wit' me?

602
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,456
Thought we was tryin' to kill her,

603
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:52,550
thought we was tryin' to poison her.

604
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,618
Tryin' to feed her feces or whatever.

605
00:30:55,618 --> 00:30:57,840
- Well, at least I can say this
is the closest one to black

606
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,208
that you brought since this (indistinct).

607
00:30:59,208 --> 00:31:00,521
- Now, I agree with that.

608
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:01,610
(everyone talking at once)

609
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,730
- Okay, that's enough
everybody, all right?

610
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,880
- It's okay ma, 'cause you know what,

611
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,687
I had to go through my share of women

612
00:31:06,687 --> 00:31:07,520
to get to the right one

613
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,770
and I feel that Jasmine's the right one.

614
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,270
- Boy, if you don't get your head

615
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,076
out of the crack of your ass!

616
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:14,080
- Barbara!

617
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:14,913
- What!?

618
00:31:14,913 --> 00:31:18,530
- Now son, I'm sure
Jasmine is a nice girl,

619
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:21,633
but to bring her here to meet
your family after you engage,

620
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,280
don't sound like she's the one.

621
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,607
- Honey, everything that
looks good ain't good for you.

622
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:29,440
- Ain't that the truth.

623
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,223
- Um! Oh yes sir, I'm telling you.

624
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,473
- She's all right. We good.

625
00:31:35,551 --> 00:31:38,030
(doorbell rings)

626
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,267
- Baby, it's so good to see you.

627
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:42,770
Look at you! Honey, you
look just as beautiful

628
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,332
as you did five or so years ago!

629
00:31:45,332 --> 00:31:46,165
- Thank you, it has been

630
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:47,340
a long time hasn't it?
- It has been.

631
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,647
- Awww, that's my girl! How
you doin' baby? Bring it in!

632
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:53,470
- (laughs)
- Awww,

633
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,660
it's good to see you baby, ooohhhhh!

634
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,665
It feels good to be home,
New York is phenomenal!

635
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:00,988
Oh my gosh, you would (indistinct).

636
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:01,821
- Oooohhh, oh yes!
- You know what?

637
00:32:01,821 --> 00:32:02,654
we should do girls weekend.

638
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:03,832
Go shoppin'!
- Girls trip.

639
00:32:03,832 --> 00:32:05,030
- Girls trip.
- Oh I love it!

640
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:08,820
- That would be awesome!
That would be awesome.

641
00:32:10,538 --> 00:32:14,522
Hmmm, I'm ready. Um um,
don't worry about that.

642
00:32:14,522 --> 00:32:17,967
- (chuckles) Stop it, you're
gonna get us in trouble.

643
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:18,800
- Lisa?

644
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,437
What are you doin' here?

645
00:32:26,437 --> 00:32:27,987
I didn't expect you to be here.

646
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,430
- Neither did I.

647
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:37,340
I mean, I wasn't expecting
for you to be here either.

648
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,460
Your mom said that you're hardly home

649
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,540
during football season, so...

650
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:45,600
- Yeah, I'm on injured reserve,
so coach let me fly out,

651
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,880
but mom, you didn't tell me
that Lisa was gonna be here.

652
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,821
- I ain't gotta tell you nothing'!

653
00:32:51,821 --> 00:32:52,654
- Nothin'.

654
00:32:52,654 --> 00:32:55,020
- This is my birthday and it's my house!

655
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,080
- Absolutely.
- Yes, it is baby.

656
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,830
- That's right and you didn't even tell us

657
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,200
that she was comin'.

658
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,033
- What?

659
00:33:01,033 --> 00:33:03,270
- Honey, Lisa is my guest.

660
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,120
Baby, can I take it?

661
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,327
- Yes.

662
00:33:05,327 --> 00:33:06,160
- Look at her.

663
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,365
- Ooohhhh.
- Ooohhhhh.

664
00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:08,198
- Dang!

665
00:33:08,198 --> 00:33:10,010
(everyone laughs)

666
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,463
Son, you are in trouble.

667
00:33:12,463 --> 00:33:13,296
- Mom, come on man.

668
00:33:13,296 --> 00:33:16,868
- Oooohhhh, she done growed
up now. Ding, ding, ding!

669
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:18,410
(everyone laughs)

670
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:22,106
- Well, this is Jasmine.

671
00:33:22,106 --> 00:33:22,939
- Awwww.

672
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:26,313
- My fiance, my fiance.

673
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,570
- Boy why did you have to say that?

674
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,653
- 'Cause she is!

675
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:31,493
- Naw, you dumb just like yo daddy.

676
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,210
- No, it's okay.
- Yes, he is.

677
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:37,590
- Hi, I'm Lisa, I'm an
old friend of Jonas'.

678
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,200
Have we met? You look familiar.

679
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,490
- Oh no, I'm sure we don't
run in the same circles.

680
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,970
- Absolutely not, 'cause she
runs in a pack a gold diggers.

681
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:46,873
- What did she just say?
- Nothin'.

682
00:33:46,873 --> 00:33:48,918
- Yes, she does.
- Barbara...

683
00:33:48,918 --> 00:33:50,620
- Barbara, will you come
help me in the kitchen?

684
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,130
Can you please come help

685
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:55,570
- And while you're in there,

00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,700
'cause this is bouts to get good!

687
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,595
- Come on pop.
- (laughing).

688
00:33:59,595 --> 00:34:02,000
- So, I hear you're quite
the man on the field.

689
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,543
Some things never change.

690
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,833
- You know, I do all right,
you know, a little bit.

691
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:11,520
- All right? Baby don't be so modest.

692
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,163
My man, has it goin' on.

693
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,237
These last few years have been wonderful.

694
00:34:17,237 --> 00:34:18,719
- Ha! Years?

695
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,031
- Years?
- Years?

696
00:34:20,031 --> 00:34:21,983
We ain't never seent you before today!

697
00:34:21,983 --> 00:34:22,815
- Never!

698
00:34:22,815 --> 00:34:23,710
- Y'all have, come on man.

699
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,500
- We've been off and on for a few years,

700
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,960
but Jonas just popped the
question just last week!

701
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,922
Look at my rock.

702
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,683
- Yes, it's beautiful!

703
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,438
Jonas, what took you so long?

704
00:34:36,438 --> 00:34:37,973
- I, you know, had to make sure

705
00:34:37,973 --> 00:34:39,871
she was the right woman for me,

706
00:34:39,871 --> 00:34:43,521
so it's only goin' be
one Mrs. Johnson, so...

707
00:34:43,521 --> 00:34:44,353
- That ain't even goin' happen.

708
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:47,050
- Um um.
- They didn't even set a date.

709
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:49,790
They didn't even set a date.
- Um um, um um.

710
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:50,840
- It ain't happenin'.

711
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:55,130
- Hey, what's up lil
bro? How's everything...?

712
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,969
- Lisa!
- Heyyyy!

713
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,278
How are you (indistinct)?

714
00:34:58,278 --> 00:34:59,111
- Hello, how are you?

715
00:34:59,111 --> 00:35:02,800
- You have grown to be such
a tall, handsome young man!

716
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,710
- Yes, yes, yes,

717
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,110
I was hopin' that I'd see
you around here again.

718
00:35:06,945 --> 00:35:08,850
You know, you're my favorite!
- Okay. So tell me what's been

719
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:09,740
goin' on?

720
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,980
How's school? Do you have a girlfriend?

721
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,530
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, y'all
can catch up a little bit

722
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,363
later on...

723
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,790
Derek, I want you to meet my fiance.

724
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:20,170
- All right man, but I'm
talkin' to Lisa. All right?

725
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,003
I'll get to it.

726
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,926
Don't expect me to jump
every time you say jump.

727
00:35:24,926 --> 00:35:27,676
- Hey man, you who you think
you talkin' to little man?

728
00:35:29,915 --> 00:35:31,838
You know what? It's okay.

729
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,477
- You know what? I'm
gonna run to the restroom.

730
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,890
You all catch up.

731
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,020
- Okay.
- All right.

732
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,110
- Son, why are you and your
brother always goin at it?

733
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,353
Look, he just got home.

734
00:35:40,353 --> 00:35:41,960
- It's okay mom.
- He's not gonna be here.

735
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,060
- Oh baby, listen honey, he just got home!

736
00:35:47,181 --> 00:35:50,772
(bathroom door closes)

737
00:35:50,772 --> 00:35:55,605
Come on, Lisa. You got this.

738
00:35:55,605 --> 00:35:57,205
You can do this, pull yourself together.

739
00:35:57,205 --> 00:36:00,122
(R&B music begins)

740
00:36:11,497 --> 00:36:13,914
(runs water)

741
00:36:23,134 --> 00:36:23,967
- Just get somethin' to eat,

742
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:24,800
come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

743
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,730
- Okay mom, sorry about that.

744
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,587
It's mom's birthday, let's just...

745
00:36:30,587 --> 00:36:33,337
Doin' it for her, while I'm here.

746
00:36:40,368 --> 00:36:41,699
(doorbell rings)

747
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,700
- Who could that be?

748
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,250
- Oh, oh, I almost forgot

749
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,000
about my surprise guest (chuckles)!

750
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,870
Baby, do me a favor...

751
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:51,000
go open that door.

752
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,780
- Guest!? Honey, you didn't
want the ones we had.

753
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,970
- Yeah, but you goin' like this one!

754
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:00,330
Especially you big draws
(chuckles) and listen,

755
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:02,820
you can officially no longer say,

756
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,774
I've never done anything nice for you.

757
00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:08,055
- Shut up.
- (chuckles).

758
00:37:08,055 --> 00:37:08,888
Whoooo!

759
00:37:11,449 --> 00:37:14,446
(laughing) Charlie!!
- Hey there, Johnny!

760
00:37:14,446 --> 00:37:15,279
How you doin'?

761
00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:17,760
- Boy, looka there,
lookin' like a shiny penny!

762
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,977
- Yeah, you know (indistinct).

763
00:37:20,142 --> 00:37:21,210
(both laughing)

764
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:25,060
- Listen here, I got
somebody I need you to meet.

765
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,893
- Oh yeah?

766
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:28,530
Where she at? Is she thick?

767
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,143
Red bone or chocolate milk?

768
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:33,699
Is that her right there?

769
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:35,763
Now, you know I can't do 'em that young.

770
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,377
- Let's get a closer look (chuckles).

771
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,120
Charlie, this here, my
heffer in law, I mean,

772
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,177
Lord have mercy, this is my sister in law.

773
00:37:49,177 --> 00:37:51,333
- (chuckles) Hello, my name is Barbie.

774
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,910
- Barbie? Listen, barbaric she might be,

775
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,840
but Barbie, she is not (chuckles).

776
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:00,280
She called herself Barbie.
- It's so good to meet you.

777
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,263
- Baby, the pleasure is all mine!

778
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:05,787
Lord Jesus, you finer
than the (indistinct).

779
00:38:07,275 --> 00:38:09,686
(everyone laughs)

780
00:38:09,686 --> 00:38:12,406
Johnny, you didn't tell
me she was this fine!

781
00:38:12,406 --> 00:38:13,825
- (chuckling) Ooohh, I
do believe I like you.

782
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,148
(chuckling)
- Um, um, um.

783
00:38:15,148 --> 00:38:16,390
- Mess around and make me fall in love.

784
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:19,740
- Wait, wait, fine, love?

785
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:22,243
I just throwed up in
my mouth a little bit.

786
00:38:28,694 --> 00:38:30,967
- Yes Lord, yes Lord.

787
00:38:31,957 --> 00:38:35,504
(chuckling) Heyyy (chuckling)!

788
00:38:35,504 --> 00:38:38,830
- Yeah, see, see, see, um
hm. Mission accomplished!

789
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,833
Now, who's the matchmaker
now huh (laughs)!?

790
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:44,500
- You need to be ashamed of yoself.

791
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,670
- Baby, I give it six months,
she goin' be out of my house.

792
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,283
Muah!
- Stop it.

793
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,110
- All right, everybody, let's eat.

794
00:38:53,555 --> 00:38:57,373
(upbeat music plays)

795
00:38:57,373 --> 00:39:00,206
(family chatting)

796
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,186
- Dad, can you please do the
honors of saying the blessings

797
00:39:07,186 --> 00:39:09,110
over my birthday dinner?

798
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:13,170
- Of course I will, you know,
I've got to get my prayer on

799
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:15,420
at least two, three
times a year (chuckling).

800
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,793
Ahh, yeah, okay.

801
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,460
Dear God...

802
00:39:23,645 --> 00:39:24,562
Dear God...

803
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:29,120
Dear God...

804
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,320

- Amen!

808
00:39:39,397 --> 00:39:40,510
- Amen.
- Pass me the greens

809
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,090
and the big piece of chicken,

810
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,910
that's mine (laughing)!

811
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:44,960
Happy Birthday, baby.

812
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:51,870
- You know Jonas, you
still handsome (chuckles).

813
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,119
My daughter's still askin' about you.

814
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:54,952
- Um.

815
00:39:54,952 --> 00:39:56,359
- Hell, he had all the
girls runnin' after him!

816
00:39:56,359 --> 00:39:57,470
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, heyyy!

817
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:59,760
He's just like his daddy
on that one (laughing)!

818
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:05,664
- ♪ The devil is a liar. He
ain't even yours. Baaa. ♪

819
00:40:06,076 --> 00:40:07,463
(family members chuckle)

820
00:40:07,463 --> 00:40:08,660
- Hand me that chicken right there.

821
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,030
- Auntie...

822
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:13,970
so Lisa, I heard through the grapevine

823
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,387
that you are a partner
at a pretty big law firm

824
00:40:15,387 --> 00:40:17,330
out there in New York.

825
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:19,921
- Well, actually I own my (indistinct),

826
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:21,222
- (laughing).

827
00:40:21,222 --> 00:40:23,974
but yes, I've had it for a few years now.

828
00:40:23,974 --> 00:40:27,050
(family members speak at once)

829
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,290
- Really? Well, Congratulations on that.

830
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:31,680
- Thank you.

831
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,920
- Starting a business
can be pretty rough, huh?

832
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,670
I mean most businesses fail
within like the first year.

833
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,451
- I've done fairly well.

834
00:40:39,451 --> 00:40:40,284
- (chuckles)

835
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:42,030
Most of my clients are
white collar millionaires.

836
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,457
- Yessss!
- Outstanding!

837
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:47,290
(family members chatting at once)

838
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,889
- Well, I am proud of you

839
00:40:48,889 --> 00:40:51,822
and I wondered what you were
doin after all these years.

840
00:40:51,822 --> 00:40:54,265
- (chuckles).

841
00:40:54,265 --> 00:40:56,765
- (chuckles).

842
00:40:58,683 --> 00:41:02,520
- Well Jay and I started
our own clothing line.

843
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:05,560
We broke a little over even
this year, small profit,

844
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,610
but we're on our way.

845
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,081
- Right.

846
00:41:09,081 --> 00:41:11,054
- Heffer, ain't nobody talkin' to you.

847
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:12,200
- Hmm.

848
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,267
- They tryin' to catch up
and there you go dippin' in.

849
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:17,903
(in funny voice) Small
profits, but we're on our way.

850
00:41:17,903 --> 00:41:20,683
Heffer, let them catch up! Dang!

851
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,653
- Good Lord.

852
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,390
- Look, y'all thought it, I just said it.

853
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,223
(some family members agree in unison)

854
00:41:27,223 --> 00:41:29,690
- Listen, listen, Jasmine
handles my financials,

855
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:30,540
so that's why she's (indistinct).

856
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,373
- Figures...

857
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,260
She's a gold digger.
- (chuckling).

858
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,477
- Lisa, honey, I'm so proud of you.

859
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,050
Jonas and Jasmine too.

860
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,133
- Thank you, mom.

861
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:44,990
- So Jay...

862
00:41:47,928 --> 00:41:49,473
- (hesitantly) Yes, Aunt B?

863
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,510
- Why did you bring her here?

864
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,843
Yeah, why? I mean, you don't love her.

865
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,716
She's a pretty girl and all of that,

866
00:42:00,716 --> 00:42:04,374
but look here, you and
Lisa, y'all got history.

867
00:42:04,374 --> 00:42:05,750
- (laughs).

868
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,802
- This is temporary, five
years are goin' pass,

869
00:42:09,802 --> 00:42:12,153
you're goin' be lookin' for
Lisa and it's goin' be too late!

870
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:18,790
I'm just saying, hmm? What? What uh huh.

871
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,853
Y'all know y'all thought
it, I just said it.

872
00:42:24,577 --> 00:42:25,410
You know what, as a matter of fact,

873
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,830
let's get it all out there on the table,

874
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:27,710
that's what we goin' do.

875
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,530
Let's get it all out on the
table, right here, right now!

876
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,320
- Not on your sister's birthday Hamhock!

877
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,420
- Listen, somethin'
wrong? We not good enough?

878
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,253
Me and your mama?

879
00:42:37,253 --> 00:42:38,880
- Hold, stop, Auntie, hold it.

880
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,440
What are you talking about right now?

881
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,370
- Listen, every time you
bring a woman in this house,

882
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:46,860
she don't never look like me
and Flo, I'm tellin' ya now!

883
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,720
if she ain't white, I'm tellin'
you, if she's a black girl,

884
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,600
- Barbara don't!

885
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,310
- Um, I'm just sayin'.

886
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:56,290
- Color has never been
an issue in this house

887
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,680
and definitely not colorism.

888
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,593
Honey, I taught my boys
that love is colorblind.

889
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:06,937
- Listen Flo, that's yo
son, you goin' support him,

890
00:43:06,937 --> 00:43:08,817
you goin' let him slide wit everything,

891
00:43:08,817 --> 00:43:11,190
but I'm gonna say it, because
see you love him, Flo,

892
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:13,088
I love him too, but I'm
goin' tell him the truth.

893
00:43:13,088 --> 00:43:14,160
- Let her get it out!

894
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,161
- Is this what fame does, huh?

895
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:19,410
- She goin' say what she want anyway.

896
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:24,290
- Is this what fame does?
Is this what fame does?

897
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:30,683
Get you so far away from your roots?

898
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,500
Get you somebody that
look like me or your mama

899
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:39,143
and not some barbie, 'cause
you sure as hell ain't Ken.

900
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,030
- At least get someone
look like your mother.

901
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:51,570
At least your mama.

902
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,963
- Whoa pops, come on,
what you talkin' bout man?

903
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:57,160
Come on, it's not even like that.

904
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,410
- No, so what is the like?

905
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,260
I mean, no disrespect to you baby,

906
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,560
but (chuckles) he can do better.

907
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,733
- No disrespect,

908
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,340
just cause you,
- Just because of what?

909
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,930
- Just, 'cause you say
"No disrespect" at the end

910
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,680
of your insults, doesn't make
it any less disrespectful.

911
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,219
- See, this what I'm talkin' about.

912
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:13,680
Get rid of her.
(some family members chuckle)

913
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,573
Get rid of her nephew!

914
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,001
- Dad do something.

915
00:44:18,001 --> 00:44:19,960
- What you want me to do?

916
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,513
I tried to tell you!

917
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:28,320
Besides this, this better
than "Iyanla fix your life."

918
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:32,651
(laughing).

919
00:44:33,593 --> 00:44:35,289
- You know what!?

920
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:36,513
- What!?
- Let it go, just let it go,

921
00:44:36,513 --> 00:44:38,100
just let it go, leave it alone.

922
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,770
- No! I wanna address
what your aunt just said.

923
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,760
- Hey stop,

924
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,330
stop, stop, stop, let it go.

925
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:44,163
- No!

926
00:44:46,041 --> 00:44:50,453
- Goin' and let her! Yeah, address me.

927
00:44:52,345 --> 00:44:53,530
- That's what's wrong wit' you people.

928
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:55,780
- Wait. You people. Did
she say "You people?"

929
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,380
- See, see, see, look, I
said leave it alone, right?

930
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,533
Just sit down Jas.

931
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,661
Jasmine! Sit down now.

932
00:45:03,661 --> 00:45:05,752
- [Barbara] (chuckling)
- Now!

933
00:45:05,752 --> 00:45:07,252
- Whoo hoooo, yes!

934
00:45:09,197 --> 00:45:10,030
And you're just goin' let him shut you up,

935
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,620
and sit you down like that, huh?

936
00:45:12,822 --> 00:45:15,472
Let me let you understand
somethin' real good, honey.

937
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,863
Jay was raised to respect women

938
00:45:19,863 --> 00:45:20,696
- Um hmm.

939
00:45:20,696 --> 00:45:23,830
- Women! All right, but listen here

940
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,790
and had he talked to one of us like that?

941
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:28,653
Lord have mercy on his soul.

942
00:45:28,653 --> 00:45:30,669
- Ain't that the truth?

943
00:45:30,669 --> 00:45:33,170
- Exactly, exactly what I'm talking about.

944
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,180
You know what I'm saying?

945
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:39,180
This is why, that I will
never be with a woman like,

946
00:45:39,661 --> 00:45:40,494
you know what?

947
00:45:40,494 --> 00:45:41,327
- Say it.

948
00:45:41,327 --> 00:45:42,877
- No, no, no, no, it's okay, no, no, no.

949
00:45:42,877 --> 00:45:43,940
- No, say it.

950
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,447
- It's pointless, just...
- No, I want you to finally

951
00:45:46,447 --> 00:45:48,273
say it so we can know who you really are!

952
00:45:48,273 --> 00:45:50,467
- THIS WHY I DON'T COME HOME, AUNTIE!

953
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,973
'Cause you're embarrassing,
look what you doing!

954
00:46:03,444 --> 00:46:04,990
(slams table)
- Now, I said it!

955
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,990
- Now, wait a minute, huh?

956
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,883
I got to draw the line right there!

957
00:46:11,382 --> 00:46:14,060
Boy, you watch how you talk to your aunt.

958
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:15,610
- You respect your elders, boy.

959
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:21,100
- Now, I don't like her either.

960
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,420
She's got real bad gas

961
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:26,433
and she's chases all the
neighborhood pets away, I know.

962
00:46:27,568 --> 00:46:30,650
And those claws that she calls nails,

963
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:32,890
scraping up my hardwood floor.

964
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:37,530
These was new hardwood
floors, but she is your aunt.

965
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,437
She practically raised you as her own.

966
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:43,900
- That's right.

967
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,987
- Apologize, to her.

968
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:50,270
Apologize, to her.

969
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,253
I said apologize!

970
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,793
- I'm sorry, Auntie Barbara.

971
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:07,400
I shouldn't have talked to you like that.

972
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,520
- Right, you was wrong.

973
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,790
Let you slide this time, Jonas.

974
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,667
The next time you won't
even see it coming.

975
00:47:25,777 --> 00:47:26,853
- Oh boy.

976
00:47:26,853 --> 00:47:29,403
- It'd be like a Sunday afternoon game.

977
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:36,947
Come in like a line backer
and knock you on your...

978
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:40,110
aspirin out. You got an aspirin, Flo.

979
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:40,943
- I need a cigarette.

980
00:47:40,943 --> 00:47:43,320
- Wait, wait, you got some weed?

981
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,103
- Charlie, what is wrong wit you?

982
00:47:45,103 --> 00:47:47,600
Charlie, what is...
- I got them cataracts in

983
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,433
my eyes!

984
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:50,380
- Wait, wait, now. We don't puff puff

985
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,960
the magic dragon in this house.

986
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,060
You gonna have to take that mess out back,

987
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,173
where your aunt buries all her bones.

988
00:48:00,257 --> 00:48:03,821
- You know what? I've had
enough. You, people are crazy.

989
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:06,334
(everyone speaks at once)

990
00:48:06,334 --> 00:48:08,447
- Jasmine, Jasmine, where you goin'?

991
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,080
- I need to be alone.

992
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,770
- (chuckles), bye.

993
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:13,120
Ain't nobody goin miss her.

994
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,753
- You know what?

995
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,690
I'm outta here too, you know what?

996
00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:22,183
I am tired of everything
being about you Jonas!

997
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:26,820
Here it is mom's birthday

998
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,073
and somehow all the focus is on you.

999
00:48:37,524 --> 00:48:38,630
I bet you don't even know,

1000
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:43,630
this party is also for mom
being in remission from cancer.

1001
00:48:44,094 --> 00:48:44,927
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1002
00:48:46,626 --> 00:48:47,830
- Mom, you had cancer?

1003
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:51,710
- That's right, mom had cancer

1004
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:52,750
and they didn't wanna tell you

1005
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,200
and worry you during your
little football season.

1006
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,916
- Ma, come on, had I had known,

1007
00:48:57,916 --> 00:49:00,196
then I would've been here.
- Known what? You still

1008
00:49:00,196 --> 00:49:01,033
wouldn't have been here!

1009
00:49:01,033 --> 00:49:03,927
When does the superstar have time for us!?

1010
00:49:05,478 --> 00:49:09,137
Huh? Nah, while you've
been off bein' a superstar,

1011
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,233
I've been here being a son.

1012
00:49:16,006 --> 00:49:17,373
You know who's name Nate called?

1013
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:22,790
Yours, but that's all goin'
to change, you know what?

1014
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:26,973
I can't take it, mom, I'm
sorry we ruined your birthday.

1015
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,107
I'm out.

1016
00:49:30,107 --> 00:49:30,940
- Don't leave.
- Come on D, don't...

1017
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:34,043
- Derek, Derek, Derek!

1018
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,223
I'll get him.

1019
00:49:40,324 --> 00:49:43,490
- All I wanted, was to
have family come together

1020
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:45,620
this weekend for my birthday

1021
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,010
and what's it come to?

1022
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,053
A hot glorified mess.
- Um um, um, um.

1023
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,948
- Ma, can we please just
talk about this later?

1024
00:49:54,948 --> 00:49:57,679
- Oh yeah, we can talk about it,

1025
00:49:57,679 --> 00:50:00,240
but right now, this is my birthday dinner

1026
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,530
and I am determined to enjoy myself.

1027
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:04,363
- Yes ma'am.

1028
00:50:06,863 --> 00:50:08,640
- All right, everybody let's eat.

1029
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,159
- All right.

1030
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:12,992
(R&B music plays)

1031
00:50:27,428 --> 00:50:29,178
- [Johnny] Hey Derek!

1032
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:40,543
(Barbara and Lisa talking)

1033
00:50:40,543 --> 00:50:42,720
- It's just like the men to disappear,

1034
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,127
I'm telling ya now, when it's time

1035
00:50:44,127 --> 00:50:45,840
for the domestic work to be done.

1036
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,281
- The meal was delicious, thank you.

1037
00:50:48,281 --> 00:50:49,114
- Yeah it was good.
- (chuckling).

1038
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:50,470
- Anyone for some coffee?

1039
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:51,885
- Oh, I'll take a cup, thank you so much.

1040
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:55,330
- Ooohhh, no honey, you know
coffee don't agree wit' me.

1041
00:50:55,330 --> 00:50:58,930
It just keeps me up and gives me gas.

1042
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,907
Y'all know what happened
last time to you, don't you?

1043
00:51:00,907 --> 00:51:02,137
- Um hm.
- (chuckling).

1044
00:51:02,137 --> 00:51:04,214
- Killed all the house plants too.

1045
00:51:04,214 --> 00:51:06,200
- Ooohhh (laughing)!

1046
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,470
So, where did everyone else go?

1047
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:10,130
- They all went to go find Derek, baby.

1048
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:12,160
I'm just so worried about my baby.

1049
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,980
- Yeah, you know he's at that age.

1050
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,260
Tryin' to figure it out
(indistinct) isn't easy.

1051
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,760
- You know, you that same sweet girl

1052
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,593
they left here years ago.

1053
00:51:18,593 --> 00:51:20,110
- Awwww.
- Yes, you are.

1054
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,660
Yes, you are.
- In some ways I am,

1055
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:23,290
but a lot has happened since college.

1056
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,670
- Um
- I know.

1057
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:25,770
- We see that.

1058
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:27,420
You all woman now.
- (laughing).

1059
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,410
- Whhoooo, girl, you got to tell us,

1060
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:33,070
you got to tell us about
them gorgeous New York men.

1061
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:36,220
Ooohhh, I know you got
some stories to tell.

1062
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,663
Child, I got to live
vicariously through you.

1063
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:43,469
You know since my husband died,

1064
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:45,300
I ain't been gettin' no action

1065
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:46,880
and you know, Flo.

1066
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,330
She ain't got no story that
lasts longer than two minutes.

1067
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:51,140
- Shut up.
- (chuckling).

1068
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,408
- It's the truth.

1069
00:51:52,408 --> 00:51:53,593
(all laughing)

1070
00:51:53,593 --> 00:51:55,483
- Auntie, there hasn't been anyone.

1071
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:57,843
- Nobody?

1072
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:02,310
- No, since college,
no, I work all the time,

1073
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:04,853
so there's no wild stories to tell.

1074
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:09,432
- Okay, not even a little one
night stand here, there huh?

1075
00:52:09,432 --> 00:52:10,957
- (chuckling) No.

1076
00:52:10,957 --> 00:52:12,617
- Oh, what about a little bump and grind?

1077
00:52:12,617 --> 00:52:15,010
Huh? I don't see nothin' wrong

1078
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,710
wit' a little bump and grind, huh!

1079
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,293
That keeps ya focused baby.

1080
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,200
- No one.

1081
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:27,200
- Oh, I just assumed
somebody was tearin' that up.

1082
00:52:28,674 --> 00:52:30,252
- Huh?

1083
00:52:30,252 --> 00:52:32,820
You know when a woman ain't
gettin' none, I'm telling you,

1084
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:37,820
she be mean, and cankerous like, like me.

1085
00:52:38,517 --> 00:52:40,075
- But you sweet as pie baby.

1086
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:41,099
(everyone laughs)

1087
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:42,650
- Yes you are, yes you are.

1088
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:46,130
- Like many of my friends,
I'm not into casual sex.

1089
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,182
I connect sex with being
with the person I love

1090
00:52:48,182 --> 00:52:50,134
and wanna spend the rest of my life with,

1091
00:52:50,134 --> 00:52:50,967
- Hmmm.

1092
00:52:50,967 --> 00:52:52,760
- but I wanna get married.

1093
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,620
- Amen baby, do it God's way.

1094
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:58,263
- That's beautiful, but tomorrow
ain't promised to you baby.

1095
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:00,913
You better get you some, hmmm?

1096
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,700
Um hmm, yes. Get it while it's moist.

1097
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,150
- Ummm.
- Yeah, 'cause when time

1098
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:12,204
will pass baby and you'd be
dryer than the Sahara desert.

1099
00:53:12,204 --> 00:53:13,700
(all laugh)
- I'm telling you somethin',

1100
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,852
I'm talkin' from experience
honey, the struggle is real.

1101
00:53:16,852 --> 00:53:17,685
- (laughs)

1102
00:53:17,685 --> 00:53:18,518
- Auntie, I'll (indistinct)

1103
00:53:18,518 --> 00:53:19,990
- It's real.
- I see.

1104
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,918
- Yes.

1105
00:53:20,918 --> 00:53:25,014
- (chuckling)
Get it baby.

1106
00:53:25,014 --> 00:53:26,514
- [Johnny] DEREK!?

1107
00:53:29,238 --> 00:53:30,071
DEREK!?

1108
00:53:40,886 --> 00:53:41,719
DEREK!?

1109
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,750
- Baby listen, you know, I try not to pry

1110
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:48,300
and I tried to stay out of
you and Jonas' business,

1111
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,423
- Until now, hell.

1112
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,483
- Baby, what happened
between you and Jonas?

1113
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:56,060
He doesn't talk about it.

1114
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,588
- My heart was broken.

1115
00:53:57,588 --> 00:53:58,421
- Um.

1116
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:04,010
- It's like a whirlwind of
emotions just came rushing back.

1117
00:54:04,010 --> 00:54:05,710
Feelings that I thought were gone.

1118
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:25,440
- Where you think you goin'?

1119
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,900
- Nowhere, man. I'm here.

1120
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,890
- Punkin' out?

1121
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,430
- Nah, let's go.

1122
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:32,440
- All right, follow me.

1123
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,373
- Let's do this!

1124
00:54:36,637 --> 00:54:38,390
- But baby, you held it together.

1125
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:39,223
- Um hm.

1126
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:44,357
- Um hm, yes you did, 'cause
I would've slapped the taste

1127
00:54:44,357 --> 00:54:47,400
out of Jasmine's mouth, I
mean that, yes, I would've.

1128
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,110
- It wasn't easy.
- I believe you.

1129
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:51,450
- After all these years I
can't believe I still love him.

1130
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:56,450
- Ha! (clapping) I knew
it, I knew it! Um um um.

1131
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,890
- If falling out of love is so hard,

1132
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,740
why is that? Like, how
do you turn love off?

1133
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:04,990
- You can't!
- You can't turn that off,

1134
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:06,379
baby.

1135
00:55:06,379 --> 00:55:09,279
And it seem like you ain't
ready to just move on, are you?

1136
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:13,093
But you got to tell us what happened.

1137
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:19,920
- Things changed. You know,
when we went to college,

1138
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,814
the us became about him.

1139
00:55:21,814 --> 00:55:23,390
- Um.

1140
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,743
- Then there was a
popularity and the girls.

1141
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:30,070
Long story short. I caught
him with a girl in his room.

1142
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:32,963
- NO! And you didn't call me?

1143
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:36,170
Came up there and set
it off, you know that?

1144
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,950
- Baby, I didn't know he cheated on you,

1145
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,520
honey I raised him better than that.

1146
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,353
- Yes.

1147
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:46,940
- Yeah, you know, I just, that
day I ran back to the dorm,

1148
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:50,020
I packed my things, I left that night.

1149
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:52,663
I transferred to another
college, I never looked back.

1150
00:55:54,015 --> 00:55:55,770
- Um, um, um.

1151
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:58,520
- Seems to me that you two
have some unresolved issues,

1152
00:56:00,426 --> 00:56:02,920
but if you two still have feelings,

1153
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:04,240
maybe things can work out.

1154
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,130
- Nah Flo, now I love
Jonas like my own son,

1155
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,660
but he was wrong, what
he did was wrong baby

1156
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,060
and who's to say he wouldn't do it again.

1157
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:13,710
Men, money, and power, I'm telling you,

1158
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:15,810
that's a dangerous combination.

1159
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:18,986
It is for you know, God forgives.

1160
00:56:18,986 --> 00:56:20,725
- Ohhhh, here we go!

1161
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:25,725
♪ Ohhhh Bible Study, Bible study 101, ♪

1162
00:56:26,237 --> 00:56:28,457
♪ please turn to your neighbor. ♪

1163
00:56:28,457 --> 00:56:30,666
- Stop.
- (laughing).

1164
00:56:30,666 --> 00:56:31,530
- What you want us to say, Flo?

1165
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:33,600
What you want to say,
always takin' us to church.

1166
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,760
- Look, all I'm tryin' to say
- What?

1167
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,330
- Is that people learn
from their mistakes,

1168
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:42,270
love takes time, love is a test

1169
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:46,780
and it's heartbreak and forgiveness.

1170
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,613
- Um hm, um hm.

1171
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,260
- Finally goin' be one of us now, homie.

1172
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,263
- Make it official.

1173
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,990
- Man, he ain't ready.

1174
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:01,040
- Hit that real quick.
- Yo, you scared?

1175
00:57:02,655 --> 00:57:05,280
(inhales weed)

1176
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,637
- Man, you got baby lungs.
- Yeah (indistinct).

1177
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,963
- Baby, you got to seize the moment.

1178
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:16,803
Sometimes you only get one chance.

1179
00:57:18,058 --> 00:57:20,130
I remember when I was
dating this other young man,

1180
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:22,863
and Johnny had eyes for me,

1181
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,506
everybody in my family
loved this young man,

1182
00:57:26,506 --> 00:57:28,042
because he was perfect.
- Yes!

1183
00:57:28,042 --> 00:57:30,390
- Good family and marked for success.

1184
00:57:30,390 --> 00:57:35,020
- Um hm, Kevin, um hm, I
liked him. I wanted him.

1185
00:57:37,402 --> 00:57:40,980
Oh yeah, I did. Who didn't (chuckles).

1186
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,710
- Then there was Johnny.

1187
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,530
Johnny was from the poor side of town,

1188
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:49,830
didn't have much to offer.

1189
00:57:51,155 --> 00:57:54,696
Ooohhhh, sugar wugar, baby, darling, dear!

1190
00:57:54,696 --> 00:57:55,540
(chuckles)
- Um.

1191
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,483
Johnny made me feel so special.

1192
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:01,703
I loved him before I even knew I did.

1193
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:05,810
- What do you mean by that?

1194
00:58:05,810 --> 00:58:09,200
- See, one day I heard that
Johnny was leaving town

1195
00:58:10,483 --> 00:58:12,330
and I didn't know if
I'd ever see him again

1196
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:14,050
or if he'd ever come back.

1197
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:14,883
- Um.

1198
00:58:16,093 --> 00:58:18,443
- But I knew that if I
didn't seize the moment,

1199
00:58:19,690 --> 00:58:22,403
I'd lose out on my once
in a lifetime love.

1200
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:28,480
Baby, that's the day,
I told him I loved him.

1201
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,723
- That is a beautiful story Mom Johnson.

1202
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:32,820
- Thank you baby.

1203
00:58:33,735 --> 00:58:35,656
Gives me goosebumps, ooohhhh,

1204
00:58:35,656 --> 00:58:36,489
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!

1205
00:58:36,489 --> 00:58:37,937
(all chuckles)

1206
00:58:37,937 --> 00:58:41,040
- (yawning) Oh, excuse me.

1207
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,850
I'm getting a little restless.

1208
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,430
I'm gonna go ahead and
head to my parent's house

1209
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:45,910
and get some rest.

1210
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:47,590
- No baby, stay right here.

01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,357
That boy was so jealous of you.

01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,200
Charlie, this boy breath was so bad,

- Stuck up? Chris?

1267
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:50,520
- He act like a white woman

01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,727

I see you grown into that big
old head of yours (chuckles).

1273
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:07,600
Boy, I used to feel sorry for yo neck.

1274
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,693
It was like any minute (rope
breaking sound) (chuckles).

1275
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:12,640

It ain't everyday, I get to

01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,270
- Nope. Don't matter.

1293
01:02:09,770 --> 01:02:11,100
Hello?

- Now how'd you know she was goin' call?

1299
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:26,370
- Simple, I married a
black woman (chuckling).

1300
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:31,629
- You need to get one of what I have.

1301
01:02:31,629 --> 01:02:32,462
- What is that?

1302
01:02:32,462 --> 01:02:34,360

- Aight!

1328
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:34,260
- My lady would've never even
thought about interrupting me.

1329
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:35,610
- What you say?

1330
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:38,610
- She would've just taken
the trash out herself.

1331
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:42,310
The only interruption, is
bringin' me an ice cold beer.

1332
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:44,260
- Now he does have a point there, pops.

1333
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:48,460
Certain women just get it, pops.

1334
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:50,277
Now we men, so we real simple, right?

1335
01:03:50,277 --> 01:03:52,400
All we care about is women that can cook,

1336
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,466
give us peace of mind and great sex!

1337
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:57,320
(chuckles)

1338
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,790
- Speaking of which,
they really know how...

1339
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:02,280
- Wait, stop right there (laughing),

1340
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,030
I'm not goin' sit here and listen to this.

1341
01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:07,690
You ain't never been with
a black woman to compare!

1342
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:09,447
- Man, I have!

1343
01:04:09,447 --> 01:04:11,200
- You have?
- I have.

1344
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,120
- He hasn't, 'cause everybody knows

1345
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,477
that a sister puts it down,
all right (chuckling)?

1346
01:04:18,365 --> 01:04:20,710
And that's why your mama
got the championship ring.

1347
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:22,280
I told you bout her!
- Sho nuff.

1348
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,220
On our wedding night, you hear me?

1349
01:04:24,220 --> 01:04:26,461
Yo mother backed that thing up on me like,

1350
01:04:26,461 --> 01:04:29,053
(brrrp)(brrrp)(brrrp) had me singing

01:04:29,053 --> 01:04:32,336
♪ My, my, my, my, my... ♪
- And you goin' chime in unc?

1352
01:04:32,336 --> 01:04:33,169
Come on pops, stop.

- That's how good ya mama made me feel.

1354

I'm talkin' about your mama, boy.

1356
01:04:37,394 --> 01:04:39,370
and that's why I want you to stop.

1357
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:41,470
'Cause look pops, times
have changed, right?

1358
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:44,420
People have evolved
since your ancient era.

1359
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:46,090
- No, no, son.

1360
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:49,090
The problem is young people today,

1361
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:51,330
believe whatever the media tells them.

1362
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,640
The media lies to us son.

1363
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:57,680
The media, they lie to us
every day to try to get us

1364
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,393
to do what they want us to do.

1365
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:02,573
Like puppets.

1366
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:10,710
We see it, we believe it.
Don't follow the crowd boys.

1367
01:05:12,636 --> 01:05:13,469
- AYE!

1368
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:18,182
This yo boy, you go first!

1369
01:05:18,182 --> 01:05:19,559
- What's up!?

1370
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:20,743
- Yeah! Let's go!

1371
01:05:20,743 --> 01:05:24,826
(gang proceeds to jump Derek in)

1372
01:05:37,959 --> 01:05:39,292
- That's enough.

1373
01:05:51,045 --> 01:05:54,295
(gang talking at once)

1374
01:06:19,516 --> 01:06:21,705
- Come on, I got you, man.

1375
01:06:21,705 --> 01:06:22,538
Come on.

1376
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:33,180
- Okay, I hear you. Case and point,

1377
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:34,620
Jonas, remember the type of car

1378
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:36,820
I drove in college?
- Yeah, little hoopty, Chevy

1379
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,361

- (laughing),

1380
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:39,194
yeah that.

1381
01:06:39,194 --> 01:06:43,480
Anyway, I was tryin to
holla at the sistas.

1382
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:44,990
They didn't wanna talk to me,

1383
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:46,670
because the type of car I drove.

1384
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:49,270
- Wait a minute, wait, wait,
how'd you get your head,

1385
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:51,555
yo big old head in that little bitty car?

1386
01:06:51,555 --> 01:06:52,983
- (laughing).
- Better yet, how'd you get

1387
01:06:52,983 --> 01:06:53,816
another brother

1388
01:06:53,816 --> 01:06:55,426
in the car wit' you?
- (laughing).

1389
01:06:55,426 --> 01:06:56,930
- Wasn't no room in the car, Charlie!

1390
01:06:56,930 --> 01:07:00,063
- Any way, I didn't have
a lot of money back then.

1391
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,100
I couldn't afford to take 'em places

1392
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,210
and buy 'em expensive things

1393
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:08,950
and they was always sayin'
stuff like you talk too white

1394
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:13,123
or relax, you walk too stiff.

1395
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,233
- You do.

1396
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:18,470
- Okay, okay, but look,

1397
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:21,747
I was never black enough for the sistas.

1398
01:07:28,470 --> 01:07:29,393
So, guess what?

1399
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:33,005
I stopped comin' their way.

1400
01:07:33,005 --> 01:07:36,749
- Yeah, yeah, get it all out, yeah.

1401
01:07:36,749 --> 01:07:37,858
Is that it?

1402
01:07:37,858 --> 01:07:40,200
- I don't know Johnny,
the boy kind of preachin'.

1403
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:41,380
Shut up Charlie!

1404
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:44,893
- But, let me tell you
when my life changed.

1405
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:49,003
When I started datin' other races.

1406
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:54,150
They didn't ridicule me
for not having money.

1407
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:57,206
In fact, they saw what I could become,

1408
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:59,150
- What you could become?

1409
01:07:59,150 --> 01:08:00,983
- but when a brother made a come up,

1410
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,893
started driving that Bentley,

1411
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,280
all the sistas wanted one.

1412
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:12,810
I'm like, "Oh, now you
wanna holla at a brotha."

1413
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:13,713
It's too late!

1414
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:17,633
I started throwing up my own stop sign.

1415
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:22,590
- Boy, sit yo $5 butt down!
- (laughing).

1416
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:24,162
- Boy, I'll make change on you.

1417
01:08:24,162 --> 01:08:27,416
- Okay!
- (laughing).

1418
01:08:27,416 --> 01:08:31,760
- Yeah boy, you are suffering
from Black Dateless Syndrome,

1419
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,040
that's all that is (chuckles).

1420
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:36,546
- Look here, my office
hours are nine to five.

1421
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:38,782
- (laughing) Maybe his
shirt's too tight, Charlie.

1422
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:39,615
- (laughing).

1423
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,610
- Boy I swear, does it snap
in the middle, like a leotard?

1424
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:44,250
- Yeah, I think I saw one of his balls

1425
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:45,728
hanging off to the side too.

1426
01:08:45,728 --> 01:08:47,764
- Ugh (laughing).

1427
01:08:47,764 --> 01:08:49,559
Ugh, ugh!
- (laughing).

1428
01:08:49,559 --> 01:08:52,229
- Man, don't worry about it.
- (laughing).

1429
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:54,830
- What you laughin' at?
With that goat shirt on.

1430
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,120
Mariachi or somethin'
like that (indistinct).

1431
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,430
- Well, my sponsor pays
me to wear this shirt,

1432
01:08:58,430 --> 01:08:59,733
so it don't matter, sir.

1433
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:06,389
- Anyway, I'm tellin' you, black love,

1434
01:09:06,389 --> 01:09:08,590
good black love still exists.

1435
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:10,036
- Um hm.

1436
01:09:10,036 --> 01:09:13,375
- And look here, no woman is perfect

1437
01:09:13,375 --> 01:09:15,840
and there's good and bad in every race,

1438
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:17,941
but the problem with you young fellas is,

1439
01:09:17,941 --> 01:09:20,740
y'all's too busy following the trends!

1440
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:23,210
You need to get with a
woman that's good for you,

1441
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:24,649
no matter what her race is.

1442
01:09:24,649 --> 01:09:28,190
- See your mother, I tell
ya, man, she was with me

1443
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:31,300
when I didn't have two
nickels to rub together.

1444
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,843
I couldn't even afford to
buy her a wedding ring.

1445
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:39,399
I take it in a string and I
tied it around her finger,

1446
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:42,013
promised to buy her diamond ring someday.

1447
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:45,490
Your mother wore that
string around her finger

1448
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:48,420
proud all that time and never cared about

1449
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:50,473
what anybody had to say about it.

1450
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:54,559
- Wait, wait, wait, pops, this story true?

1451
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,930
- Huh?
- Huh? Is it true?

1452
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:56,763
- You mean...

1453
01:09:56,763 --> 01:09:57,900
Nah, nah, it wasn't true.

1454
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,570
- Johnny, man dang!
- Come on pops, man!

1455
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,240
- You know what I'm saying?

1456
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,490
The point, listen to what I'm sayin'!

1457
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:03,730
The point is...

1458
01:10:05,639 --> 01:10:08,543
your mother is a good woman!

1459
01:10:08,543 --> 01:10:11,800
- Um hmm, Flo's a good
woman and she thick too.

1460
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:12,870
- Hey, watch your mouth.

1461
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:14,930
Hey, that's enough about
my wife's onion, all right?

1462
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:15,763
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1463
01:10:16,915 --> 01:10:20,170
- Now, at the end of the day, your mother,

1464
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:23,710
she holds me down and
at the end of the day,

1465
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:25,021
that's what every man needs.

1466
01:10:25,021 --> 01:10:25,853
- Um hmm.

1467
01:10:25,853 --> 01:10:27,590
And you know, for years, black women

1468
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:30,365
have been gettin' a bad
rap for bein' strong,

1469
01:10:30,365 --> 01:10:31,198
- Um.

1470
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:33,280
- but most people fail to
realize why they needed to.

1471
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:34,800
- Educate these youngsters, Charlie.

1472
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,960
- Um hmm, well look here, they
raisin' sons with no father.

1473
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:38,793
- Yes.

1474
01:10:38,793 --> 01:10:41,309
- We got 2 million imprisoned black men

1475
01:10:41,309 --> 01:10:42,700
and most with no fathers.

1476
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:46,600
- That's right, Jay, you
always tryin' to get me

1477
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:48,660
to move out of this neighborhood.

1478
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:52,503
These young boys need us,
but I'll make you a deal.

1479
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:55,130
You build that community center,

1480
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:59,610
you start those programs and
I'll entertain your offer

1481
01:10:59,610 --> 01:11:01,170
to buy me a house.

1482
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:03,200
- Okay, that's a deal, pops.

1483
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,032
- All right.

1484
01:11:04,032 --> 01:11:05,180
- Hold up!

1485
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:06,820
How did we get on this topic?

1486
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:08,320
- You, knucklehead (laughing)!

1487
01:11:09,522 --> 01:11:11,977
- You know what? You two failed to mention

1488
01:11:11,977 --> 01:11:14,980
the two most important
things in a relationship.

1489
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:17,830
- Talk about it, Charlie.
- And that's love and respect.

1490
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:18,860
- Yes, sir.

1491
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:22,109
Now for a woman's got those two things,

1492
01:11:22,109 --> 01:11:23,959
oohh Lord, she'll do anything to you.

1493
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,100
- Charlie, you mean
anything for you, right?

1494
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:27,933
- Yeah, that's what I meant.

1495
01:11:27,933 --> 01:11:29,230
- Yes.
- (chuckling).

1496
01:11:29,230 --> 01:11:30,900
- Now Jonas, look here.

1497
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:33,500
I saw how you was lookin' at Lisa earlier.

1498
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,870
- Yeah, yeah, I had to
keep my eye on Jesus

1499
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:36,829
when she walked in.

1500
01:11:36,829 --> 01:11:38,502
- Whhoooo, oooohhhh, ooohhh,

1501
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:40,202
little sweet tenderoni (laughing)!

1502
01:11:41,492 --> 01:11:43,360
- Yeah, she's still lookin' good, man,

1503
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,450
but look, she left me.
I mean just disappeared.

1504
01:11:46,450 --> 01:11:47,960
- Well, what did you do?

1505
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:50,180
- Pops to this day I have no idea, man.

1506
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:53,139
- Wait, am I missing something?

1507
01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:54,210
Lisa's in town?

1508
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,147
- Yeah and she looks amazing man

1509
01:11:56,147 --> 01:11:57,280
and the cold part about it,

1510
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,030
I couldn't even hide it from Jasmine.

1511
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:02,164
- Sounds like y'all got
unfinished business.

1512
01:12:02,164 --> 01:12:05,100
- (chuckles) Yep, you still love Lisa?

1513
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:09,127
- Why would he go back to
Lisa? Remember she left him.

1514
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:12,760
- All right, y'all ain't
tryin' to play no cards.

1515
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:15,530
Listen, I'm startin'
to feel like Dr. Phil.

1516
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:17,230
I'm goin' to bed

1517
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:19,397
and Derek better get
his butt in this house.

1518
01:12:19,397 --> 01:12:20,980
- Wait, now I still need to deduct

1519
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:22,430
my social security check now!

1520
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:27,493
- I know you're not
seriously considering this.

1521
01:12:28,546 --> 01:12:30,309
- Aye man, I owe it to
myself to see what happened

1522
01:12:30,309 --> 01:12:32,530
between us and if they're
still something between us.

1523
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:37,020
- No man, she had a chance
bro, a woman like Lisa,

1524
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,059
she doesn't deserve men like us.

1525
01:12:39,059 --> 01:12:41,889
- Hold on, why do you care who I'm with?

1526
01:12:41,889 --> 01:12:43,980
- Come on Jay, man,

1527
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:45,780
I just don't wanna see you get hurt.

1528
01:12:47,410 --> 01:12:48,243
- I respect that

1529
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,820
- Yo Jay, what happened to D, man?

1530
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:00,793
- Ayo pops! Pops!

1531
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:03,150
- What happened Jay?

1532
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:06,120
- Derek, what happened to my son!?

1533
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:07,477
I'm not gonna ask you again,

1534
01:13:07,477 --> 01:13:08,895
what happened to my son!?

1535
01:13:08,895 --> 01:13:10,093
- It was a gang initiation!

1536
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,460
- Got you lil bro.
- Come on Flo, answer the

1537
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,293
phone.

1538
01:13:15,293 --> 01:13:16,950
Answer the phone!

1539
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:19,270
- Yo Chris, need you to hold
the spot down for me, man.

1540
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:20,103
- I got you.

1541
01:13:20,103 --> 01:13:22,210
- Anybody call, we at
the Bayview Hospital.

1542
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:23,950
- Somethin' bad happened to Derek!

1543
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:26,250
Meet us at the at the Bayview Hospital!

1544
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:27,713
- You're goin' be all right, dog.

1545
01:13:38,555 --> 01:13:40,472
- Oh man, this place...

1546
01:14:03,367 --> 01:14:05,617
- Mama Johnson is that you?

1547
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,633
Who's there?

1548
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:11,693
- It's Chris.

1549
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,969
Lisa!? Is that you?

1550
01:14:14,969 --> 01:14:16,230
- Chris? What are you doing here?

1551
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:18,620
- I can ask you the same.

1552
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,702
- I was upstairs taking a
nap when I heard noises.

1553
01:14:21,702 --> 01:14:22,840
I wasn't expecting to see you here.

1554
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:24,809
- I bet you weren't,

1555
01:14:24,809 --> 01:14:26,930
I reached out to you a few times, but...

1556
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:29,230
- Where is everyone?

1557
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:32,410
- You mean Jay, Jasmine
(indistinct) for something,

1558
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:34,683
but everyone else, I'm not sure.

1559
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:39,814
- Okay, it's gettin' late, I'ma
go turn it in for the night.

1560
01:14:39,814 --> 01:14:41,490
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1561
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:44,000
You don't gotta be so quick to leave.

1562
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,300
Why don't you stay and you know,

1563
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:47,150
keep me company til everyone returns?

1564
01:14:48,570 --> 01:14:51,943
- Why Chris? Remember? I was
never good enough for Jonas.

1565
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:53,612
- Hmm.

1566
01:14:53,612 --> 01:14:57,120
You remembered that. We were kids,

1567
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,830
let's leave the past in the past.

1568
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:02,143
Besides, I was just tryin'
to protect you from Jay.

1569
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:07,469
- Derek! Hang in there Derek!
We got you man! Hang in there!

1570
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:09,450
Go! Hurry up! Go! Go!

1571
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:10,800
- Go home and wait for your mama,

1572
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,360
just in case she doesn't get my message.

1573
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:13,193
- Okay.

1574
01:15:13,193 --> 01:15:15,163
- Derek, hold on, son. Hold on now.

1575
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:19,937
Pull up right here in the
front, right here in the front!

1576
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,889
- And I'm supposed to thank you?

1577
01:16:02,889 --> 01:16:05,100
And why the hell you keep
sending pictures to my DM's?

1578
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,593
'Cause we're not friends!

1579
01:16:06,593 --> 01:16:10,600
- I did what I did for
you. You a sweet girl.

1580
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,080
- What are you doin'?

1581
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:15,570
- Remember, I liked you first,
Jay just got in the way.

1582
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:17,870
I guess you like that
football star type, huh?

1583
01:16:19,180 --> 01:16:22,309
Back then I was just this tall,
skinny kid wit' a big head,

1584
01:16:22,309 --> 01:16:25,260
but I'm all grown up now.

1585
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:29,397
- Um and clearly I see you've
grown into your big ego too.

1586
01:16:29,397 --> 01:16:31,282
- And a bank account to match it.

1587
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:34,760
I see the way you be lookin' at me.

1588
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,570
- I'm looking? Nah, see you got it all..

1589
01:16:36,570 --> 01:16:39,393
- Wrong? I don't think so.

1590
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:44,700
This is a time for us
to finally be together.

1591
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,860
I don't see what you saw in Jay, anyway.

1592
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:50,280
- What? Be together, nah
Chris, see now you trippin.

1593
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:53,883
- Look, I was the one
deserving of you, not Jay.

1594
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:59,693
Everything was given to him
and he never appreciated it.

1595
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:03,290
- I've never felt that way about you.

1596
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:06,889
It's always been about
Jonas, never about you.

1597
01:17:06,889 --> 01:17:11,889
- Jonas, Jonas, Jonas.
I'm so tired of that name.

1598
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:15,853
- Leave now and maybe I won't tell him

1599
01:17:15,853 --> 01:17:18,020
what his supposedly best friend said.

1600
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:20,750
- FORGET JAY! You know you want this!

1601
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:21,800
- What!?

1602
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:22,633
Chris, no!

1603
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:25,889
- Lord, I'm so glad I charged up my phone,

1604
01:17:25,889 --> 01:17:28,690
I would've never gotten
that message from Johnny!

1605
01:17:28,690 --> 01:17:29,639
Oh God (panicking)!

1606
01:17:30,547 --> 01:17:33,050
- [Passenger] Now, I lay me
down to sleep, I pray the Lord

1607
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:34,448
my soul to keep.

1608
01:17:34,448 --> 01:17:37,280
Lord, (indistinct)!

1609
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,240
- I'll take what I want,

1610
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,793
rather you wanna give it to me or not.

1611
01:17:43,460 --> 01:17:45,730
Go ahead, go ahead. Beg for it.

1612
01:17:45,730 --> 01:17:46,733
- Chris stop!

1613
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:52,133
- Go ahead, beg for it.

1614
01:17:53,733 --> 01:17:56,433
- You trippin'.
- I'll like it even more.

1615
01:17:56,433 --> 01:17:57,540
- Get off of me!
- I can't stand women

1616
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:58,373
like you!

1617
01:17:59,611 --> 01:18:01,730
Think you're too good for a brother!

1618
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:02,920
- Chris, think about what you're doing,

1619
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,580
you're making a big mistake.

1620
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:05,859
Someone can walk in here, anyone.

1621
01:18:05,859 --> 01:18:07,250
- SO!!

1622
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:11,943
No one's gonna believe you!
It's my word, against yours!

1623
01:18:13,584 --> 01:18:14,629
- Chris stop!

1624
01:18:14,629 --> 01:18:17,530
Chris stop it, what are you doing?

1625
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:19,330
- Hey man! The hell's goin' on in here!?

1626
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:20,570
- He tried to rape me!

1627
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:21,800
- Tried to rape you?
What's wrong wit' you!

1628
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,737
- Man, ain't nobody try to rape that girl!

1629
01:18:23,737 --> 01:18:25,570
- Time for you to leave, Chris.

1630
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:27,530
- So it's like that, man?

1631
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:28,940
You just gonna believe her?
- Hey hey! One thing I know

1632
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:31,202
about Lisa, she ain't a liar, dude!

1633
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:35,853
- So, it's like that?
- Yeah, it's like that.

1634
01:18:36,858 --> 01:18:38,050
All this damn time, you've
been tryin' to make me

1635
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:39,520
stray away from Lisa, huh?

1636
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,120
Tryin' to block what God has had for me

1637
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,883
this whole time, right?

1638
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:47,969
- You know what you know?
You know I loved her first.

1639
01:18:47,969 --> 01:18:49,070
- Huh?

1640
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:51,719
- All through high school and college.

1641
01:18:51,719 --> 01:18:54,963
Man, you had the best
girls, the nicest cars,

1642
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:58,463
everything came so easy to Jonas.

1643
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:01,430
I was just 'posed to sit around

1644
01:19:01,430 --> 01:19:03,440
and get yo sloppy seconds,

1645
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:07,790
but you know what, man,
she ain't all that anyway.

1646
01:19:07,790 --> 01:19:09,820
- Okay, leave now before
I call the police!

1647
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:11,020
- All right (chuckling).

1648
01:19:11,873 --> 01:19:14,124
- Hey, you okay?

1649
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:14,957
- Yeah, (indistinct).

1650
01:19:14,957 --> 01:19:18,957
- Aye (chuckling), before I go,

1651
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,688
you ever wonder why
Lisa broke up with you?

1652
01:19:26,688 --> 01:19:30,500
I would know, because I set it all up.

1653
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,448
- Chris, what are you
doing? Don't do this.

1654
01:19:32,448 --> 01:19:33,990
- (laughing).
- What are you talking about?

1655
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:37,219
- Nothing Chris, please.
- Sweet Jasmine, glad you

1656
01:19:37,219 --> 01:19:40,027
could make it, aye, we're all here

1657
01:19:40,027 --> 01:19:41,430
and they need to know.

1658
01:19:41,430 --> 01:19:42,621
- He doesn't need to know.

1659
01:19:42,621 --> 01:19:43,650
- I don't need to know what Jasmine?

1660
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:45,916
- Nothing, Chris, please...
- Get!

1661
01:19:45,916 --> 01:19:47,350
- No.
- What!?

1662
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:50,230
You like stories? I got
a doozy for you, bro.

1663
01:19:50,230 --> 01:19:51,710
- Yeah, okay.

1664
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:53,073
- Once upon a time,

1665
01:19:54,050 --> 01:19:57,240
I paid a girl to be in
your apartment naked,

1666
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:02,240
then I called Lisa, and I
told Lisa to come to your room

1667
01:20:02,790 --> 01:20:07,790
and when Lisa got there,
sweet Jasmine was there.

1668
01:20:08,090 --> 01:20:10,907
She answered the door butt
ass naked (chuckling).

1669
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:12,900
- Jasmine!?

1670
01:20:12,900 --> 01:20:14,740
- So, that's where I know you from?

1671
01:20:14,740 --> 01:20:17,850
- (chuckling) Just a little confession

1672
01:20:18,710 --> 01:20:21,663
before we part ways, brother.

1673
01:20:21,663 --> 01:20:24,200
- No, he's not worth it! he's not worth it

1674
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:27,793
- Jonas, I'm sorry you
had to find out like this.

1675
01:20:29,180 --> 01:20:30,730
You supposed to be my man, huh?

1676
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:33,650
How are y'all goin' do this to me?

1677
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:36,230
After all I did for you and you, huh!?

1678
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:40,070
- Jasmine ain't nothing but a gold digger.

1679
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:45,070
As for me, I got tired of
seeing everything go your way.

1680
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:49,396
Then you not giving a damn
about no one, but yoself.

1681
01:20:49,396 --> 01:20:51,860
- Jonas, I was that person back
then, but I'm different now.

1682
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:53,492
I do love you.
- (laughing)

1683
01:20:53,492 --> 01:20:55,173
- I do.
- Love, love.

1684
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:57,290
Is that the same love

1685
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:59,553
that just had you in
my bed earlier tonight?

1686
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:04,040
- You know you've been
bribing me since college.

1687
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:05,420
Jonas, I do love you.

1688
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:06,840
- Look,
- I do.

1689
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:10,120
- Has he told you that he
lost his $40 million contract

1690
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,940
when he hurt himself?

1691
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:13,833
Hey, still love him?

1692
01:21:15,219 --> 01:21:17,577
I bet you ain't even told
your family, did you?

1693
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:25,609
(clapping) The great Jonas Johnson.

1694
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:30,860
How does it feel to be tossed aside?

1695
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:32,460
- Feels like I'm the same

1696
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:34,570
and you'll never be like
me on your best day.

1697
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:38,763
So, on my mama, you better
get outta here dude!

1698
01:21:38,763 --> 01:21:43,763
- (chuckles) All right, I'll
leave, but hey, before I go.

1699
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:49,993
I told you I've been with a black woman.

1700
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:55,362
- I'm sorry.

1701
01:21:56,219 --> 01:21:57,053
- Let's GO!

1702
01:21:58,480 --> 01:21:59,452
- Goodbye Jasmine.

1703
01:22:02,139 --> 01:22:03,680
No, no, no, no, no, baby, baby, it's over.

1704
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:04,513
They're out of our lives.

1705
01:22:04,513 --> 01:22:07,350
They're out of our lives, all right?

1706
01:22:07,350 --> 01:22:09,370
Whoa, whoa, whoa, but how are you?

1707
01:22:09,370 --> 01:22:10,389
All right, did he hurt you?

1708
01:22:10,389 --> 01:22:13,110
- No, I'm fine.
- Huh?

1709
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,139
- Go slow.

1710
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:25,897
- You okay little man?

1711
01:22:25,897 --> 01:22:26,730
- I'm a G.

1712
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:32,469
- Doctor said he'll be fine,
just minor cuts and bruises.

1713
01:22:32,469 --> 01:22:33,370
- Let me help you.

1714
01:22:35,219 --> 01:22:36,303
You a G, huh?

1715
01:22:37,857 --> 01:22:39,743
- Easy now, easy.

1716
01:22:39,743 --> 01:22:41,130
I got you, all right.

1717
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:42,532
- You two need to talk.

1718
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,440
Now I've had my say in the matter.

1719
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:46,440
- Yes ma'am.

1720
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:48,666
- Lisa a lot's been goin' on
tonight, baby I'll fill you in.

1721
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:49,950
Are you still stayin' with us?

1722
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:52,903
- Yes ma'am, I completely understand.

1723
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:56,730
I'll leave you all to talk, okay?

1724
01:22:56,730 --> 01:22:57,739
Have a good night.

1725
01:22:57,739 --> 01:22:58,700
- Goodnight, I'll see you tomorrow.

1726
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:01,813
- Son, I meant what I said.

1727
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:05,773
I love you, son.

1728
01:23:07,927 --> 01:23:08,817
I love you, son.

1729
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,809
- I love you too pops.

1730
01:23:10,809 --> 01:23:13,202
- Hey pops, what about
that three second rule?

1731
01:23:17,010 --> 01:23:20,763
- That rule no longer
applies to either of my boys,

1732
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,007
come here, now.

1733
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:36,870
Flo, I've got something that
I need to go and handle.

1734
01:23:36,870 --> 01:23:37,702
- Johnny...

1735
01:23:37,702 --> 01:23:39,103
- But, I will be back shortly.

1736
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:43,960
Goodnight everybody.
- Johnny, please, please,

1737
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:45,013
be careful.

1738
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:49,741
- Hey I'm goin' wit' you pops.
- Oh my God.

1739
01:23:49,741 --> 01:23:51,080
- Goodnight fellas.
- All right now.

1740
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:51,937
- Oh God, please.

1741
01:23:51,937 --> 01:23:53,207
Jesus, please, please.
- Ay pops, can you change

1742
01:23:53,207 --> 01:23:54,040
your shirt?

1743
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,106
Can't go in the hood with this shirt on.

1744
01:23:55,106 --> 01:23:56,693
- Flo, it's goin' be all right Flo.

1745
01:23:56,693 --> 01:23:58,960
Flo, it's goin' be all right.
- Oh God, oh God, oh God.

1746
01:23:59,927 --> 01:24:02,580
- Derek, you need anything, baby?

1747
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:04,490
- No, Auntie, I'm fine.

1748
01:24:04,490 --> 01:24:06,796
- Are you sure there? Looka there. Jesus.

1749
01:24:06,796 --> 01:24:07,860
- I'm gonna go to bed, actually.

1750
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:10,882
- Baby, you got to be
more careful, look here.

1751
01:24:10,882 --> 01:24:11,715
- I got it, I got it.

1752
01:24:12,642 --> 01:24:14,000
- You good? Um.

1753
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,320
- Sure you're okay?

1754
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:16,153
- I am Charlie.

1755
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:18,559
- Let me help him a little bit.

1756
01:24:18,559 --> 01:24:20,280
Lord baby, obviously...

1757
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:21,730
- You guys have a good night.

1758
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:31,380
- Get some rest now, go
ahead, go in your room.

1759
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:36,380
Don't come back down. Jesus,
um, um, um, um. I tell ya.

1760
01:24:39,349 --> 01:24:40,766
Charlie, come on.

1761
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:43,250
(whispering) Come on up here.

1762
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:44,719
- Oh yeah, it's gettin' late!

1763
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:47,380
- Yes it is, it's gettin very late.

1764
01:24:47,380 --> 01:24:48,740
- I better go too.

1765
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:51,180
- You call, go ahead now.

1766
01:24:51,180 --> 01:24:53,219
Go ahead Charlie, I'll see you tomorrow.

1767
01:24:53,219 --> 01:24:54,340
- See y'all later.

1768
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:59,107
- Come on Charlie, shhhh,
come on. Be quiet, shhhh.

1769
01:25:00,277 --> 01:25:02,057
Get you some (indistinct).

1770
01:25:02,057 --> 01:25:05,307
(Hip hop music begins)

1771
01:25:20,626 --> 01:25:23,293
(knock on door)

1772
01:25:24,178 --> 01:25:25,011
- Door like this?

1773
01:25:25,011 --> 01:25:26,588
- Man, what the...
- Who's this?

1774
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:28,090
(knock on door)

1775
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:29,257
- Who is that?

1776
01:25:32,110 --> 01:25:33,233
- Stand down.

1777
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:41,170
What's up wit you two? We cool?

1778
01:25:41,170 --> 01:25:43,040
- That's yet to be determined,

1779
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,760
- I think you know why we're here, right?

1780
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,400
Y'all jumped my little brother.

1781
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,160
- (laughing)

1782
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,853
- Oh, that's funny to you, huh?

1783
01:25:52,544 --> 01:25:54,553
- Well, if it ain't Mr. NFL himself.

1784
01:25:55,627 --> 01:25:58,130
You two got some heart comin' in here.

1785
01:25:58,130 --> 01:26:00,130
I could blow your brains out right here!

1786
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,250
- Boy, you don't scare me.

1787
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:04,969
Now, I know your daddy.

1788
01:26:04,969 --> 01:26:07,080
We was boys before he went off to prison

1789
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,290
to serve a life sentence.

1790
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:13,300
Now, you can shoot me, but what
is that going to accomplish?

1791
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:15,851
You wanna die in prison like your father?

1792
01:26:15,851 --> 01:26:16,684
- (chuckles).

1793
01:26:16,684 --> 01:26:18,850
- Now, I know why you're angry, son.

1794
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:20,450
I know why all of you are angry,

1795
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:25,963
but you can't let the sins
of your father become yours!

1796
01:26:27,712 --> 01:26:29,097
- Don't come in here actin'
like you understand us

1797
01:26:29,097 --> 01:26:32,323
or better than us, especially you Mr. NFL!

1798
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:38,690
I should just blow your head off!

1799
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:40,290
You don't care nothin' about us.

1800
01:26:40,290 --> 01:26:41,867
You donate some tennis
shoes around Christmas.

1801
01:26:41,867 --> 01:26:44,700
and you think that makes it right?

1802
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:50,930
- Now, wait a minute, boy,
I'm not goin' just let you...

1803
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:54,233
- Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah,
it's okay, pops. I got it.

1804
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:02,710
Yeah, you goin' shoot me, Boog? Hmm?

1805
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:03,830
Pull the trigger,

1806
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:06,303
'cause I ain't afraid to
die what I believe in.

1807
01:27:07,455 --> 01:27:08,600
- What you believe in!?
- Yeah.

1808
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,670
- And, what you believe in, huh?

1809
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:11,690
- My family...

1810
01:27:14,210 --> 01:27:18,817
and you, Boog, yeah and everybody in here

1811
01:27:19,857 --> 01:27:24,833
and I believe, we stop killin'
each other and work together.

1812
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:31,270
We can make things happen,
man. That's what I believe.

1813
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:32,280
- How are we goin' to do that!?

1814
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:34,430
- First by you takin'
that gun out by head.

1815
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:39,823
And let's chop it up, I got you.

1816
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:46,559
- We don't need no empty promises.

1817
01:27:47,410 --> 01:27:49,230
That's all people ever done is lied to us.

1818
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:51,910
- Ay, it's me, you got my word

1819
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:53,059
and I'ma listen to you.

1820
01:27:54,323 --> 01:27:55,690
Now, tell me what we need.

1821
01:27:55,690 --> 01:27:59,323
I wanna change this world,
let's start wit' our hood.

1822
01:27:59,323 --> 01:28:00,313
What we need?

1823
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:05,993
- We'll see, we'll chop it up.

1824
01:28:05,993 --> 01:28:07,400
- All right, that's my word.

1825
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:08,233
- All right.

1826
01:28:10,175 --> 01:28:12,143
- Aight, let's go pops.

1827
01:28:20,090 --> 01:28:23,173
(upbeat music plays)

1828
01:28:47,375 --> 01:28:50,107
- Charlie, now I'm not a loose woman,

1829
01:28:50,107 --> 01:28:53,139
but I am havin' a loose moment.

1830
01:28:53,139 --> 01:28:56,111
- Well, I'm goin' do my
best to break yo back!

1831
01:28:56,111 --> 01:28:57,645
- Oooohhhh oooohhh ooohhh
- (laughing).

1832
01:28:57,645 --> 01:28:59,967
- Now my back been broke, years ago!

1833
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,630
- So you...
- So you...

1834
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:14,580
- come on, sit down, you go first babe.

1835
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:17,133
Just relax.

1836
01:29:25,910 --> 01:29:28,139
- Why didn't you come for me?

1837
01:29:29,993 --> 01:29:32,862
I know I made it virtually
impossible for you to find me,

1838
01:29:34,004 --> 01:29:36,154
but I believe that love
always finds a way.

1839
01:29:38,889 --> 01:29:40,903
- We found each other now, right?

1840
01:29:42,303 --> 01:29:44,160
'Cause we're here right now

1841
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:45,410
and if any constellation,

1842
01:29:46,559 --> 01:29:48,373
Lisa I thought about you every day.

1843
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:50,920
It was just my foolish pride

1844
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,820
that stopped me from coming after you.

1845
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:56,180
- You're engaged to be married.

1846
01:29:57,171 --> 01:29:59,230
- Yeah, well, Aunt B was right,

1847
01:29:59,230 --> 01:30:00,663
Jasmine never had my heart,

1848
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:04,563
I mean, truth be told no one
can ever take your place.

1849
01:30:08,490 --> 01:30:10,320
- I don't know if my heart...

1850
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,210
risk being broken.

1851
01:30:12,210 --> 01:30:13,043
- Mine either.

1852
01:30:14,130 --> 01:30:16,660
Lisa I was devastated when you left,

1853
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:18,600
but what remained constant.

1854
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,723
Was my love for you.

1855
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:23,103
Woman, I love you more than I ever have.

1856
01:30:25,469 --> 01:30:27,570
I'm mature enough now to
deal with my feelings,

1857
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:28,583
I wasn't back then.

1858
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:35,623
- I'm scared.

1859
01:30:36,718 --> 01:30:37,678
- I know.

1860
01:30:37,678 --> 01:30:40,511
(R&B music plays)

1861
01:31:23,977 --> 01:31:25,227
- Go from here?

1862
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,263
- Let's figure it out another day.

1863
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:36,889
What I need to know...

1864
01:31:36,889 --> 01:31:39,045
- I'm (indistinct) (chuckles).

1865
01:31:39,045 --> 01:31:41,878
(R&B music plays)

1866
01:31:57,370 --> 01:31:59,370
- And what's it come to?

1867
01:31:59,370 --> 01:32:01,678
A hot glorified mess.

1868
01:32:01,678 --> 01:32:04,910
Son, you hurt me when you
said we embarrassed you.

1869
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:07,910
We sacrificed everything so
that you could be where you are.

1870
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:10,883
- You did, ma.

1871
01:32:12,249 --> 01:32:14,889
- But you don't want
nobody that looks like me.

1872
01:32:14,889 --> 01:32:17,362
Son, just who am I to you?

1873
01:32:18,361 --> 01:32:21,420
- Ma, I wasn't sayin' that about you, ma.

1874
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:22,420
- You don't have to.

1875
01:32:23,428 --> 01:32:24,844
Your actions did.

1876
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:44,300
- Good morning, ma.

1877
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:47,483
- Morning son, you're up mighty early.

1878
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:55,020
- I wanna apologize

1879
01:32:56,665 --> 01:32:57,777
for not being here

1880
01:32:59,663 --> 01:33:02,023
and the way I treated
you throughout the years.

1881
01:33:06,350 --> 01:33:07,600
Ma, look at me.

1882
01:33:12,462 --> 01:33:13,295
Ma.

1883
01:33:16,093 --> 01:33:18,143
I wish you would've told me you was sick.

1884
01:33:21,014 --> 01:33:22,615
- I didn't wanna worry you, son.

1885
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:36,317
- She reminded me of you.

1886
01:33:40,130 --> 01:33:42,463
- Who are you talkin' about?

1887
01:33:44,150 --> 01:33:45,383
- A long time ago,

1888
01:33:47,150 --> 01:33:49,573
I did choose a woman just like you,

1889
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:57,323
Lisa, but she hurt me, ma.

1890
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:03,630
Yeah, Lisa

1891
01:34:05,969 --> 01:34:08,257
has every quality I love about you.

1892
01:34:13,486 --> 01:34:15,903
- I knew she is a good woman.

1893
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:20,303
- So it wasn't you, it was Lisa.

1894
01:34:22,905 --> 01:34:27,905
(indistinct), you, reminded
me of everything about Lisa

1895
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:29,200
that was familiar to us

1896
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:33,683
and that hurt.

1897
01:34:36,110 --> 01:34:37,889
That's why I didn't stay.

1898
01:34:42,687 --> 01:34:44,187
But I never meant to hurt you.

1899
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:48,093
- I know, son.

1900
01:34:49,838 --> 01:34:52,433
I want you to know I'm proud of you.

1901
01:34:54,391 --> 01:34:56,558
My baby is back.

1902
01:34:56,558 --> 01:34:58,463
- (chuckles) Yes I am.

1903
01:35:00,469 --> 01:35:01,373
Yes I am.

1904
01:35:04,420 --> 01:35:07,153
You, I love you.
- I love you too, baby.

1905
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:11,097
- You still the most beautiful
woman in the world to me.

1906
01:35:11,097 --> 01:35:13,294
- I know (chuckling).

1907
01:35:13,294 --> 01:35:15,020
So come on, help me make these pancakes

1908
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:16,530
like we did back in the day.

1909
01:35:16,530 --> 01:35:18,260
- Sure, if only you're making your famous

1910
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:19,588
blueberry pancakes.

1911
01:35:19,588 --> 01:35:22,389
- You better know it honey,
that's you and Derek's favorite.

1912
01:35:22,389 --> 01:35:23,822
- Yeah.

1913
01:35:23,822 --> 01:35:25,401
- All right?
- All right.

1914
01:35:25,401 --> 01:35:27,843
- Start off with some flour
and sugar and baking powder.

1915
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:39,357
- Woman, don't start nothin'!

1916
01:35:40,234 --> 01:35:41,844
Only brought one pill with me.

1917
01:35:41,844 --> 01:35:44,374
- (whispering) Oh, I got
a stash (indistinct).

1918
01:35:44,374 --> 01:35:45,707
- What?
- (chuckling).

1919
01:35:45,707 --> 01:35:47,180
- Shhhh.

1920
01:35:47,180 --> 01:35:48,013
- Shhhh.

1921
01:35:50,100 --> 01:35:52,517
(whispering)

1922
01:35:59,476 --> 01:36:00,710
- (clears throat)

1923
01:36:00,710 --> 01:36:02,757
- Heyyyy! Charlie!
- Hey!

1924
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:05,740
Hey, look at Charlie, Charlie, hey,

1928
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:12,290
So early to visit us, look at Charlie.

1929
01:36:12,290 --> 01:36:13,503
- You up early.

1930
01:36:13,503 --> 01:36:15,818
I just came by to, you know,
take Barb to breakfast.

1931
01:36:15,818 --> 01:36:17,215

01:36:17,215 --> 01:36:19,252
So, Barb, Barbara,
- Huh?

1933
01:36:19,252 --> 01:36:23,710
- So you're going to
breakfast in your pajamas?

1934
01:36:23,710 --> 01:36:26,190
- Yeah, uh huh, of course, you
ain't heard of the new place

1935
01:36:26,190 --> 01:36:27,600

01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:28,860

01:36:35,300 --> 01:36:36,290
Well, church ain't the only place

Okay?
- Yeah.

1945
01:36:39,530 --> 01:36:41,580
- Okay, I see.

1946
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:44,830
Well Charlie, why don't you
just stay for breakfast?

1947
01:36:44,830 --> 01:36:45,850
Pancakes...

01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:48,775
- Sounds good to me!

1949
01:36:48,775 --> 01:36:49,618

01:36:49,618 --> 01:36:50,509
(laughter at once)

1951
01:36:50,509 --> 01:36:55,189
- All right, come on, let's eat.

1952
01:36:55,189 --> 01:37:00,189
- Whew.

1953
01:37:05,351 --> 01:37:09,809
- ♪ Self a Merry little
Christmas, let your heart be... ♪

1954
01:37:09,809 --> 01:37:10,980
- Charlie!?

1955
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:14,530
You left yo glasses in
the bathroom last night.

1956
01:37:14,530 --> 01:37:16,880
Now, how in the world did you drive home

1957
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:18,920
without these glasses?

1958
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,410
You got cataracts Charlie.

1959
01:37:20,410 --> 01:37:22,351
- It was hard, but I made it.

1960
01:37:22,351 --> 01:37:23,193
(all chuckles)

1961
01:37:23,193 --> 01:37:24,398
- Uh huh, uh huh.

1962
01:37:24,398 --> 01:37:25,764
- Good morning everyone!

1963
01:37:25,764 --> 01:37:26,630
- Good morning!

1964
01:37:26,630 --> 01:37:27,463
- Hey baby.

1965
01:37:27,463 --> 01:37:28,719
- Mr. Charlie, I apologize,

1966
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:30,780
but my rental blocked you in last night.

1967
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:31,612
- Yeah.

1968
01:37:33,046 --> 01:37:33,963
- Hmmm, um!

1969
01:37:36,407 --> 01:37:38,690
- All right, all right.

1970
01:37:38,690 --> 01:37:40,843
He slept with me last night in my room.

1971
01:37:43,340 --> 01:37:45,003
Look, we grown, shoot.

1972
01:37:46,370 --> 01:37:47,910
- Girl, we just messin' with you.

1973
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:50,190
I looked in on you last
night and saw him sleeping

1974
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:51,090
on the couch.

1975
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:52,830
- But I'll bet you he got in that bed

1976
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:54,650
later on (laughing).

1977
01:37:54,650 --> 01:37:55,708
You know I did.

1978
01:37:55,708 --> 01:37:56,800
(laughter at once)

1979
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:57,633
- Hey baby.

1980
01:37:57,633 --> 01:37:58,707
- Hey babe.

1981
01:37:58,707 --> 01:37:59,702
- Good morning Jonas.

1982
01:37:59,702 --> 01:38:01,873
- I have an early flight to catch.

1983
01:38:01,873 --> 01:38:02,903
- Ah, I didn't know you
were leavin' this soon.

1984
01:38:02,903 --> 01:38:04,780
- I know, I forgot to
mention it last night,

1985
01:38:04,780 --> 01:38:06,827
but one of my clients has an emergency.

1986
01:38:07,817 --> 01:38:09,040
- Aight.

1987
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,233
- Seems that a lot happened last night.

1988
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:15,098
You care to share.

1989
01:38:15,098 --> 01:38:16,762
- It's a long story pop...

1990
01:38:16,762 --> 01:38:18,710
- Did we miss somethin'?

1991
01:38:18,710 --> 01:38:22,160
- Let's just say, we seized the moment.

1992
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:25,253
- Oooohhh baby, you go 'head
and help yoself (laughing)!

1993
01:38:25,253 --> 01:38:27,290
- Um hmm, that's beautiful son.

1994
01:38:27,290 --> 01:38:30,757
- I told you, I told you,
I told you (laughing).

1995
01:38:30,757 --> 01:38:32,090
- (indistinct).

1996
01:38:32,090 --> 01:38:32,923
Thank you pops.

1997
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:38,980
- Lisa, can you stay a
little while longer baby?

1998
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:44,437
Yeah, baby don't go so soon,
we not through celebratin'.

1999
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:47,013
- Me either.

2000
01:38:47,013 --> 01:38:47,846
(laughter at once)

2001
01:38:47,846 --> 01:38:49,090
We just got you back.

2002
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:52,003
- I know, but I promised I'd
be back before New Year's Eve.

2003
01:38:53,541 --> 01:38:54,778
Are you okay?

2004
01:38:54,778 --> 01:38:57,413
- No, 'cause I can't bear the thought

2005
01:38:57,413 --> 01:38:59,663
of being without you again.

2006
01:39:02,303 --> 01:39:03,323
That hurt.

2007
01:39:08,830 --> 01:39:11,340
Too many years have gone
by without me seeing your

2008
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:14,480
pretty smile, pretty two brown eyes.

2009
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:17,063
- (chuckling).

2010
01:39:18,190 --> 01:39:20,040
- Look, I don't wanna lose you again.

2011
01:39:20,912 --> 01:39:22,883
- You won't, I promise.

2012
01:39:25,830 --> 01:39:27,010
You can do one-

2013
01:39:31,482 --> 01:39:32,950
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2014
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:34,960
Just tryin' to work on my nerves, just...

2015
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:38,513
- That's what's up, bro! Yeahhhh, boy!

2016
01:39:40,630 --> 01:39:41,463
- Come on...

2017
01:39:42,808 --> 01:39:43,758
y'all stop, please.

2018
01:39:45,816 --> 01:39:46,648
Okay.

2019
01:39:46,648 --> 01:39:47,482
- What are you doing?

2020
01:39:47,482 --> 01:39:49,563
- Somethin' I should've
done a long time ago.

2021
01:39:52,937 --> 01:39:55,963
Okay, look, I let you
get away from me once.

2022
01:39:57,320 --> 01:39:59,183
I can't let that happen again.

2023
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,246
Every time I look at you,

2024
01:40:03,541 --> 01:40:05,653
I'm reminded how much God loves me.

2025
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:09,193
He brought you back to me.

2026
01:40:09,193 --> 01:40:10,443
- I believe so.

2027
01:40:11,889 --> 01:40:14,743
- I want you wit' me all the time.

2028
01:40:14,743 --> 01:40:18,313
Lisa, I've never loved anything
as much as I love you now.

2029
01:40:20,181 --> 01:40:21,014
Now look, I don't have a ring.

2030
01:40:21,014 --> 01:40:23,043
- Wait, wait, wait.

2031
01:40:23,980 --> 01:40:24,940
We can fix that.

2032
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:26,800
- Ooohhhh.
- Babe, where is it?

2033
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:27,940
- Hold on, son.

2034
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:31,183
Hold on, son.

2035
01:40:40,580 --> 01:40:41,800
This is for you.

2036
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:56,323
This is the string ring
I gave your mother.

2037
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:03,053
- So the story is true, pops?

2038
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:07,760
- Yes, I just didn't
wanna look like a punk

2039
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,160
at the card game (laughing).

2040
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:12,773
- That's deep, pops.

2041
01:41:13,712 --> 01:41:14,545
Thank you,

2042
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:25,150
- Lisa Marie (indistinct),
will you do the honor

2043
01:41:26,045 --> 01:41:29,593
of spendin' the rest of your
life wit' me and be my wife?

2044
01:41:33,530 --> 01:41:34,362
- On one condition.

2045
01:41:34,362 --> 01:41:35,532
- On one condition?

2046
01:41:37,181 --> 01:41:40,202
- Promise that we'll always
keep God the center of us.

2047
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:44,623
- I promise, God will
always be the center.

2048
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:49,139
- Yes, Jonas Johnson, I will marry you!

2049
01:41:49,139 --> 01:41:52,139
(family celebrates)

2050
01:41:55,752 --> 01:41:57,585
- Congratulations boy!

2051
01:41:59,037 --> 01:42:04,037
(muah) (chuckling) Smells like Infamil.

2052
01:42:06,664 --> 01:42:11,246
(family watches in awe and excitement)

2053
01:42:12,530 --> 01:42:13,730
- That's what's up, bro!

2054
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:16,073
- Get a room.

2055
01:42:19,645 --> 01:42:21,860
(clapping)

2056
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:23,660
- You know what? Should we tell 'em?

2057
01:42:27,370 --> 01:42:28,520
- Tell us what Charlie?

2058
01:42:34,090 --> 01:42:38,120
- Well, you know, since
everybody's sharing

2059
01:42:38,120 --> 01:42:39,653
and love is in the air.

2060
01:42:40,732 --> 01:42:41,948
I figured, I wanna share somethin' too.

2061
01:42:41,948 --> 01:42:42,781

She's finally moving!

No more wet wigs in the bathroom.
No more bad breath jokes.

2080
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:34,410
No more aroma of Bengay
throughout this house.

She's finally moving out,
Flo, who's the matchmaker now?

01:43:39,230 --> 01:43:42,230
- The wicked witch of
the west is finally gone.

2084
01:43:42,230 --> 01:43:45,350
She's finally movin' out. This right here,

2106
01:44:28,490 --> 01:44:30,342

2107
01:44:30,342 --> 01:44:31,175
(laughter at once)

2108
01:44:31,175 --> 01:44:34,342
(gospel music begins)

2109
01:44:39,610 --> 01:44:42,230
- Well, I guess that one
backfired (laughing).

2110
01:44:42,230 --> 01:44:44,300
- Well, I guess it did, yeah, yeah,

01:44:44,300 --> 01:44:49,300
well, at least we now have
two social security checks

2112
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:51,680

- (laughing).

2113

Two and two (laughing).

01:45:46,080 --> 01:45:48,683
- And nephew, you can get me that Benz.

2133
01:45:50,394 --> 01:45:51,939
Black on black.

2134
01:45:51,939 --> 01:45:54,272
- (laughs).

2135
01:45:55,875 --> 01:45:58,286
- Well, you know what? I smell bacon,

01:45:58,286 --> 01:46:00,797

2137
01:46:00,797 --> 01:46:03,246

2140
01:46:05,990 --> 01:46:08,270

2141
01:46:08,270 --> 01:46:10,735
and tell him I'm not leaving, I'm staying.

2142
01:46:10,735 --> 01:46:11,568
- That's right.

2143
01:46:11,568 --> 01:46:13,160
(laughter at once)

2144
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:16,163

your aunt ain't sweaty.

2149
01:46:23,820 --> 01:46:27,559

01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:38,059
- Yeah, I understand.

2155
01:46:38,059 --> 01:46:41,610
What about disobligements,
you think that'll be okay?

2156
01:46:41,610 --> 01:46:43,059
- Yeah, I think that's all right.

2157
01:46:43,059 --> 01:46:44,148
(both laughing)

2158
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:47,065

2159
01:47:54,794 --> 01:47:56,427
- Thank you baby!

2160
01:47:56,427 --> 01:47:57,677
