Should have to choose the right time
Probably need to run at higher speeds than normal

105
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,010
Radiation on the track it can be

106
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:48,220

If I race with you, why you?
You do not have a vehicle without the liver, racing with me?

144
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,040
If you win the car from me and Tommy

Do you understand what I say not so, do not

If I win I'll get the car you

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,660
Or have you afraid to lose me

If I win, the car of two brothers eyebrows

Look, there's no way to achieve
maximum speed of all

169
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,700
But that can also be moved over
The maximum speed be?

170
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,400
To do anything, he knows that can not be achieved
speed when the road which

171
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,170
Only a minor violation is considered suicide
Look for example at a speed of 250km / h goes

172
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,080
Not necessarily so fast
Important vehicle lighter and more compact

173
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,380
Be dragged closer, and of course, depends
on his steering wheel

174
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,560
Do not worry I'm very lucky in the corner

175
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,290
Or is the only funny parts but was dropped so that

176
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,390
Come on buddy, you're saying here is that

177
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,970
My father saw that
When he is dull without it

178
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,570
Does it matter why?
Yes, we're finding that a Mx7

179
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,040
Here, not all identified Civic
Damn, you're talking about my father nowaday!

180
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:37,910
Oh and of course the
Damn Look

181
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,920
There is a degree to the way they have anything in
What is true is that demand

182
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,720
Come on do it right

183
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,760
Kelly, we still have enough money to
buy no sound?

184

Moving in this fashion will be no deficiencies
Will run only delicious

187
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,100
Have accelerated this
Also includes air conditioning

188
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,110
I do very well
Thank you

189
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:09,040
You know what
Know what?

190
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,910
I guess this will be great there
I also think

191
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:17,250
Ok this goes to select some
I went to see Claudia has

192
00:23:56,260 --> 00:24:00,360
Hi Rick
Welcome

193
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,140
Him alright baby?

194
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:21,310
I'm sorry that
I understand, it was his brother and he wants revenge

195
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,510
But not so, he must know
What is something you should do instead

196
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,720
You know, I'm sorry he is too impatient

197
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,260
So .. I do not race now?

198
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:41,740
Kayce, he stopped again
He better than you, rick

199
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,040
He is always ready but
You should go to school, here where no benefit

200
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:50,250
He killed Tom, you know
So he called for us to go cop

201
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,350
Us food, shared with him that
but am not always the cop

202
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,550
Now I have an answer for you here, do not drop out
and not to race with him

203
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,590
You think I like racing but
I also think I love you and loves his mother

204
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,420
They do not impose that, I do
because everyone who

205
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,860
He did this for me from myself

206
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,350
These two people do not you?
No problem

207
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,610
This site is not acting nhé
She went back to the floor

208
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,880
Done right, we have nothing but
Yeah I went out right here!

209
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,490
Rick you okay?

210
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,220
So here goes quail out

211
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,070
Buy full, but the lack of machinery

212
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,970
Yeah ..
He all right?

213
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,480
Claudia talk nonsense with only
Hey Rick, focus goes

214
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,110
But only just a woman, I would expect something?

215
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,220
To focus on this
Now like to try?

216
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,720
I'm sure it will quickly
No

217
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:08,790
Ricky, he calmly went
I have him down, he must ..

218
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,490
No, you mean nothing at this end
I do not want to risk

219
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,570
Just slowly
Of course, you're right, all right, will be completed only

220
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:27,110
Ricky here to do a hand
Ok

221
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:36,320
See us find what it is this

222
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:39,820
You like it there too

223
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:13,430

Sorry, never mind

226
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,440
Rick just here a few hours ago

227
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,710
She sure did not want to break it?
Well go home

228
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,180
No, you just want to jump
To jump from thought to

229
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,720
What?
Damn, debbie, she all right?

230
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:51,970
No problem, Lou
Good jump

231
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,600
So she was not there to dance?
Is that

232
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,540
I just want to think from miscellaneous

233
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,470
So go out dancing
Ok

234
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,310
Look nè fuel pressure compressor, 50 PSI nowaday!

235
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,720
Rick does not see?
It looks delicious

236
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,620
Heard

237
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,480
The time has come prepared and know

238
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,350
Smiling does

239
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:13,330
Department scratched Do not do it my honey
Come on Kelly, do not let anyone be involved where

240
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:15,800
He is the right kind, but very stupid

241
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,680
To see how he was driving

242
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,830
Be careful with me my car
His car there

243
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,860
He is 600 seconds, while another half-mile, 12 seconds nowaday!

244
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,770
245km / h and know

245
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,320
Damn, going to drive faster

246
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,020
Map misery

247
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,110
Where is it? Lost to then

248
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,120
You think they lost it then
yes

249
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,500
We wait here or what?
Pretty quiet here

250
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,600
Hope is lost

251
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,510
I actually forgot to add the accelerator chip in it

252
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,470
There is no such
Have that

253
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,750
Met then this variable
damn

254
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:24,730
Flint Police
Right out of the car

255
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,910
Left her, knelt down there and do not move it

256
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,550
How or why he was mad, but do you?

257
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,090
He was mad eh Rick?

258
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,130
I know I killed him, but the best
that he should always retire

259
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:55,900
That's the message from kayce stars?
No, I'm warning you there is

260
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,000
He does have liver

261
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,400
Very tough, and everyone around will be affected

262
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,670
And when someone is injured, I
not like at all understand?

263
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,610
Because if someone is injured means
I do not do their tasks

264
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,910
He can not understand you?
understand

265
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,450
Understanding on?
Yes sir understand

266
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:18,960
Do not quarrel with that there, Rick

267
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:26,900
Today I considered shifting his hands with it

268
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,960
Drive carefully to

269
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,270
Now that slanted away from my car

270
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,070
Why then, do not fast?
Damn, not all sizes are

271
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:12,240
Crowded car huh?
Feng Well, your father is too drunk to look lost and confused

272
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,450
160
He weighs 160lbs huh?

273
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,050
Damn, it's Rick doing so much fat

274
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,850
You knit too much truth is gone

275
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,250
256km / h it

276
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,580
Damn not

277
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:29,520
Can not believe it is again passed
Now we discuss how it went this level

278
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,170
What is still not where, still not fast enough
to lower Kayce

279
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:39,700
Running too fast is crazy
Yes, crazy, crazy Kayce it there too

280
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,300
We have to lower it

281
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,540
Now how is it faster? Bags
did his best, and then they ran out of money

282
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,340
Yeah, I also think
Do not say that

283
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,350
We can use that nitro
He said it nowaday!

284
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,480
Nitro is too strong, the car will not be
stand where

285
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,620
Machine pressed too hard when the brake is
hopelessly

286
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,560
And if so, then it would stop expansion tanh

287
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:08,000
She is right
we have to listen to this guy tried to go way

288
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:11,800
He made his own set of NOS
I have heard much about him

289
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,480
So what? That guy is driving me to drive, ok?

290
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,610
Anyway, the guy who is that?
Domingo Juarez

291
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,940
In which the gang?
He is the most evil hands, you know you are in Los Angeles

292
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:26,950
Wait no, last Sunday racing Juarez
with the MX5 that right?

293
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,550
I thought he was supporting the team rather

294
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,480
Overflow

295
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:41,730
Okay I'm going to LA to find that guy

296
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:46,170
He did not know where to find guys?
Know, if you have liver is the

297
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,300
I go to find Claudia
Done with this guy has to go

298
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,970

Okay, Alan view maintenance system to

Mother, oh God
Ricky, I'm sorry

301
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:47,500
Human thought as I expected but then
Mother thought I quit racing and know

302
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:51,200
Granny
Children do not have to give up racing?

303
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,340
You're looking for Claudia
she was very clever, it does not follow the first

304
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:00,710
Mom was right, but no luck
My mother say that?

305
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:08,380
Son, you have to go to school the
Then that will become assets

306
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,790
Do not place this
Children do this because of Tom that he

307
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:20,490
I have no right to say this because it
Mom does not allow

308
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,500
You've lost that right when you put it

309
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:28,560
I want to repeat forever or do you?
What about you, why hide forever?

310
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:32,400
I still want to race?

Found at his watch to 288km / h but then
which still are not sure because

339
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,040
Severe vehicle vibration

340
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,770
Front wheel is about to fly off the wheels

341
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,550
And ended like a funeral car doors flying

342
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:34,390
How do you survive after
Believe it or not, at that seatbelt off

343
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:38,560
I always offer wire data and still break it

344
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:43,000
At that time I remember I flew out of car windows
and meet the land as a missile fuses stature

345
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,140
12 broken ribs and 30-day hospitalization

346
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:52,780
But 10 days later I was discharged and then
Seatbelt it off for me there may well

347
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,850
After that, I realized many things

348
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,010
Maybe no one thought he had a legendary car where children

349
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:03,120
I am still alive is because it does not abuse the NOS

350
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:06,560
But that's the real strength of the NOS

351
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:09,730
a dose of new blood do

352
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,620
Hey, I see you?

353
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,630
This intact

354
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,950
I want to buy his
Oh that?

355
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,810
If I do not want you?

356
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,520
I do not have much money but I have
can send me all what I have here

357
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,620
I do not have time to start preparations

358
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:43,890
And a few more days and then have to race with Kacey

359
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,160
Kacay?
Kacey Damn him do u?

360
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:52,730
Damn him that is true, it has killed my brother

361
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:58,570
Kacey, I know that Damn him, he
his father was also unhappy equally Trady

362
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:01,970
I do not want to recall the past

363
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:06,850
But if I get it down, I always donated his set of NOS

364
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:11,520
But do not compress too much nitrogen in the car too small for

365
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,120
Kelly is very good, she'll find a way

366
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:18,820
If there is any way to keep the car balanced, then
she will certainly find

367
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,800
My heart, I will lower it

368
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,510
Hey guys, almost done that up

369
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,380
Complete power yet?
Finished

370
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,550
She kept this party going, which I
Ok

371
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,420
Nè you hear this, how long do
so that the car is the top ground

372
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,900
With support from the two sides will be facing two very balanced

373
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:56,970
And ground vehicles will always
As the wings of fighter aircraft

374
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,660
That's right

375
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:51,080
What happened?
Oh no

376
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,920
The other guy ..
He what?

377
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,860
Kacey
He then why?

378
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:03,030
He is here

379
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,240
So what?

380
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:14,400
I think you want to know that

381
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,380
It's just one of the only idiot here

382
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:21,880
But Ms. ..
I know

383
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:28,220
Ok there anything else?

384
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:59,980
Too bored to go, to drink wine rather new nude

385
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,050
Crazy place to do?

386
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:07,000
Dammit
I looked at some of this plywood is not all

387
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,060
but where are like children everywhere

388
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:11,970
Kacey did not think he is better than stars?

389
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:16,370
Come on Lou, I did not have the money for you?

390
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:17,870
His money did not always liberal

391
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:23,910
I just thought ..
Thought I'd gone there in trouble

392
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:28,610
Well, nothing nowaday!
Okay

393
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:33,390
So this evening to have a child to amuse

394
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,180
How do you want me

395
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:50,000
Kacey damn, he knows that she is
But I do not know

396
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,350
Kacey he must watch this

397
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,850
What's This?

398
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:11,530
What the heck is this?

399
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:16,730
What do these piles of steel, but NOS bottle used to be swimming

400
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,400
Want to look like so tantalizing to me that Mira

401
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:24,000
This role is increasingly that group then
I'm not racing with it too, damn

402
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,210
I would rather hear you say it just steal a new
rather than looking at this pile of scrap metal

403
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:33,940
What I do with scrap heap this?
Well he turned away due to my

404
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,190
Dammit

405
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:44,430
Also, through which it

406
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,500
Why so hard?
Next month huh?

407
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:06,810
He must remember the average light signal NOS nhé

408
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,510
To understand them first

409
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:14,980
Look, I have a button and his preparations
can be used in emergencies

410
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,920
Okay, it's time we lower his

411
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:24,430
Not this time, Kelly
But I have to go with him, Rick

412
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:28,660
No! I do not want anyone involved more fully

413
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:33,410
Rick, careful

414
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,310
Hey Rick, remember to carefully what Kelly said nhé

415
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:40,180
I understand!

416
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,360
LA driving style severance

417
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:03,270
Playing with my back huh

418
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:24,590
À leather jacket, he really liked it
Where are you going so hard?

419
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,360
Do not play too long
Striptease star performance?

420
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:29,900
He took him to go gentle

421
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:33,200
Sorry but I find other people to go offline

422
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,400
He blocks me so hard it
He is damn map

423
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:39,240
Right and know, what I just said he loved it

424
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,310
Does it matter why?

425
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,180
Young couples car problems

426
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,580
You know me, but Flint, passed away

427
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:30,020
Race looks like going there anymore

428
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:33,300
No
I see it

429
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:35,960
Nice cars there

430
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:37,730
No worthwhile Where

431
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,000
Why he would not listen to me?

432
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,340
You're racing, I know you know who knows

433
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:49,380
Want to race? That was then

434
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:55,750
He now saw it go racing
but would then lose

435
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:57,510
What?

436
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:06,690
He joked with me eh Rick?
He lost that race to make sure it is

437
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,530
He now understands what I mean huh?

438
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:10,930
I understand that

439
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:15,440
No, no, Rick, who can win everything, from racing
You're going to lose, Kayce will get his car

440
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:20,340
And I have bunch of money then
No, no way

441
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:27,320
You must race and defeat. His mother was very hard
past few years and then

442
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:34,960
I will crush you out there, Rick

443
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:40,960
His ass is better than grinding away at school

444
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,900
Remove it all goes back to Kelly

445
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:50,240
Go go

446
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,290
Very well the misery, want to play you? S ok

447
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:47,390
Hey, do not affect me what role it

448
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,360
Yeah

449
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,610
Wise, the thinking goes

450
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:17,690
It hard to run fast, but to no avail where

451
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,670
What he makes here anymore

452
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,050
A missed call from Claudia

453
00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:17,720
Hi, Claudia ago

454
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:34,500
Come out here to go hard, hard way that he would

455
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:39,110
I will give you this place is always comfortable

456
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,280
I'll catch you here, whore

457
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:25,640
I want to say about Kacey
I have heard it

458
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:30,850
But he is a guest sop, sop he read

459
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:37,150
He harassed the girls here
I have not heard anyone ever reported it

460
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:41,720
Of course not, I'm not sure the rules of a star?
Is not say anything more

461
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:46,790
They are afraid to speak out of work
But I must say

462
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:53,030
How she going to do with it?
It must be punished

463
00:56:54,470 --> 00:56:58,500
It read here very sop
and she also is part of it anymore

464
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:04,040
It is a white guy merchant, Lou
and it had killed Tommy

465
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:10,050
She knows what to say, Deb, we know each other
has long

466
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:16,790
Tommy I think of it as child
Damn him then do not let them come here anymore

467
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:21,730
This is not a home, Debbie, this
is the place to do business, my

468
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:27,260
It is a monster
It's also a little self-made

469
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,170
It is what it's like to grow it rather shelves
Im going to Lou

470
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:33,070
All stand to play with?
So what she needs to take

471
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:39,150
Do not want to jump in here again, it just takes money and go away
But I do not have to eat out

472
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:48,160
It follows Claudia lo
Who?

473
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:51,760
We're talking about someone?
Kacey

474
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:59,270
They had been dating each other you?
It's there in her home

475
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:03,170
It wants her colorful Syndicate
So she had a report yet?

476
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,540
Do not know
so we're talking about here?

477
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:12,550
That despite reports they were stars, it is in
Where in the shop do it

478
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:14,840
And if she did not report it

479
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:18,460
So what? What will happen?
So ..

480
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:20,250
Then what will happen to stop

481
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:29,190
Deby, because of our love I say this

482
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,570
A time to rest

483
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:42,980
No, I will still jump
No, I want her to leave

484
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:49,590
He is putting pressure for me there?
I can not accept that a dancer

485
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,520
But the morning show
This is not the same with any consistency at all

486
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:58,490
I need someone to be able to attract some guy

487
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:05,490
Rather than as an ornamental bubble
but cry all day

488
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:14,310
Go home

489
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,520
How will this fine

490
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:28,520
Now, do not try to get it, crowded cars

491
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,130
Come back to try it
yes

492
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,630
You have to solve some of the hotel car anymore

493
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:38,890
This wakes up to go, to hours worked and

494
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,700
God fixed the car again à

495
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:45,780
People on the go, I have to work anymore

496
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,900
Claudia just call anything without a message

497
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:54,850
Perhaps he is just stirring only, not the
I do care too

498
00:59:56,090 --> 01:00:00,580
Okay, see you next time
Welcome

499
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:05,760
Yes and it also
Or hardening

500
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,890
But something, or do not
What are you saying that you?

501
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:15,640
May wish to meet privately at the table of 7 lo

502
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:19,440
Where?
Rear floor

503
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:23,410
Table of 7 that have not followed?
Great that

504
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:39,530
What is best not to slight
Very good, really smooth

505
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,130
Now I can go, but remember

506
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:50,900
I swear to you it hard

507
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:59,380
If you want to dance and do it here
must always pay attention to you! Hardware

508
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:04,750
Must know where you are there

509
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:16,490
Very good

510

My God, it chased us

533
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:19,990
That stupid guy
Where it is not only stupid, it was that crazy anymore

534
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:21,450
Yes, really crazy

535
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,740

Good enough set of NOS activity, we
Where will not lose

537
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:51,250
Damn him to try this one out

538
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:55,580
Rick, do not race again

539
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:57,800
Damn him, you die away

540
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:03,000
He stopped only

541
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:49,570
Help! Help!

542
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,350
Rick, oh my lord

543
01:05:02,830 --> 01:05:04,390
I'm not okay

544
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,590
Do not do that

545
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,530
Do not leave her and that
I'm sorry

546
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:16,940
Just buried his mother's son
Mom could not stand...

547
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:23,550
At the police called, she thought the baby ..

548
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:27,040
Mothers do not know what else to say

549
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:32,720
Promise is the finished
I'm not racing anymore

550
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,230
Claudia also stars then?
I do not know, they did not say anything

551
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,660
They just said that I should not loved ..

552
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,570
To my mother viewed

553
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:51,170
Perhaps they'll listen to mom

554
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,940
Also glad that he is not dead it
Ah you lucky

555
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:58,910
To me about it, Damn him is true Kacey
trash

556
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:05,120
He okay?
No, I do not know

557
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:09,220
What Claudia, why?
She alone will exceed that

558
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:17,930
Ricky is Steve, he's also customary to mother or
I heard him say to nhé

559
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:22,240
I can only say that

560
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:25,100
She fractured spine, and could not move

561
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:30,910
Few broken ribs, pelvis and again, that's all

562
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,670
Recovery will take quite some time there

563
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:36,750
And some deep cuts
How can she live?

564
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:42,220
Yes, but still need a few days tracking

565
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:46,450
I was not visiting her
I think not, or where

566
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:48,190
She needs rest

567
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:51,030
Let him see it going Steve girlfriend

568
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:54,740
Actually ..

569
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:58,770
I will see him always free 1 year

570
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:04,600
So many reporters of Steve?
107

571
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,850
Sorry dear

572
01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:25,990
He is too stupid, you are wrong, I'm sorry

573
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:45,680
I'm sorry

574
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:52,960
He did not compete again, not race again

575
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:56,460
Kacey did not care anymore
Flint did not care anymore

576
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:01,310
I just need for me dear

577
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:17,410
He must win, I do not need to stop again

578
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:24,490
And everything ended ..

579
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,530
Now, why?
she wants him and his race to win

580
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,670
Ok so there are problems that worry anymore

581
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:13,910
He and Claudia live but the car is dead

582
01:09:14,110 --> 01:09:16,480
What type of racing now?
Premium

583
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:19,870
What?
Tommy car that

584
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:21,610
Oh damn

585
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:33,650
Police must investigate, and then the room
insurance also, then wait for approval

586
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:36,060
Must take months to have money

587
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:42,030
We do not have much time left
Let's take what can be

588
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:46,940
Ok now this is

589
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:51,480
He now found through the old factory Sydney

590
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:57,480
And my request for the list of items
then flying fast, try not to be pursued

591
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,710
I have two kids in rhythm, understand?

592
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:02,550
I understand!
and I see the stars through the north

593
01:10:02,730 --> 01:10:04,720
Then turning round in a few markets east view
whether there are any

594
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:11,130
Ok understand?
Okay now do it, come on

595
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:30,810
À papers
Papers it

596
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,960
What character kiec
But he must have, also ask

597
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:45,360
What? You are talking about something that you?
Fax sent to him by my side and that

598
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:48,610
Who? What is even today no fax?

599
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:52,380
And do not be out of here if not clarified nhé

600
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:56,180
They said they faxed to him then that
But I do know what the heck

601
01:10:56,410 --> 01:11:02,110
Now, return the car to go
Come on I can not do that

602
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:04,410
I had to go pick up another friend

603
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,550
But he could not leave him here
But we sure that's all I do

604
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:12,950
Maybe they have not submitted complete
Why do not you check to see how a fax machine?

605
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,590
It can come at any time that

606
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:18,800
OK then right?
Oh come on

607
01:11:28,610 --> 01:11:31,810
Make ahead and know
This time, look away, no signal at all

608
01:11:33,350 --> 01:11:35,080
I borrowed his phone, OK?

609
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:41,550
Not here already, through other sites to see

610
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,590
Were going, but sure here

611
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,140
Alo, this

612
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:05,710
But he has not received a fax
No, still no

613
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:11,080
No, but I'm here
he was standing before me this

614
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,090
The brothers are here, but it still

615
01:12:15,830 --> 01:12:16,880
Yeah

616
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:19,220
No, he is here yet

617
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,970
I hear, they said sure fax wrong number

618
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,030
Alo, you guys need to fax you?

619
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,380
Not, my number is 3214

620
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:39,680
There behold

621
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:42,820
Stop turning his head away

622
01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:48,560
Is 3214

623
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:57,470
Wait did, why not 12,314?
Correct number is 3214

624
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:10,380
Is 3214
But in that mailbox is 12,314

625
01:13:14,420 --> 01:13:18,050
Ah ah I know, it is number 4, instead of 9
his number is 2319 nè

626
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:24,090
Dad went for me when he heard, but a 310 ..

627
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:31,170
Hey!
Damn map!

628
01:13:44,180 --> 01:13:47,880
Ê
Map misery

629
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:01,400
Come on you, go through the

630
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:15,410
We only have 2 days and a mountain of

631
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:18,380
But this is a sufficient but, again very high speed

632
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,850
Everything can still be used but

633
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:25,850
That is all what we have, race is still only

634
01:14:26,090 --> 01:14:29,290
Just try to go then good luck will come to know where

635
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:32,320
If it is not going to push him out there racing stripes

636
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:36,260
He do not have to do, he goes on the steering wheel firmly

637
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:39,400
NOS add it in?
Can not

638
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:42,560
Damaged digital starter then, can not file
work with the cylinder is

639
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:48,470
We are missing some important details such as
battery such

640
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:52,780
And it is very expensive
He was a little less money to spend

641
01:14:54,190 --> 01:14:55,620
Probably will buy enough

642
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,920
If he wins, he will have enough money to pay

643
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:03,990
If it also loses nothing happens

644
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,490
Ricky boy where are you going?
Loan

645
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:17,760
Why do you you?
I bet many here the guy rick

646
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,110
Fish lost to know it
I sure do not know?

647
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:25,850
And be going

648
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:29,920
Fucker

649
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:08,220
You doing? It took me broken

650
01:16:08,490 --> 01:16:12,450
Yet it also damaged then, sir, listen to Rick nè
This time it's a very slow

651
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:15,460
Too low front chassis is very easy to stick obstacles

652
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:20,800
Then only to be dropped as well, but if you do this
it can reduce anxiety

653
01:16:20,970 --> 01:16:25,810
this, how well one followed the speed
Max 320km / h?

654
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:30,710
He ran to the speed that it is
suicide is nothing more

655
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:33,650
Believe me, do it better

656
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:38,590
Just try to go

657
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,930
Come on, try to go on, do not try I know

658
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:48,160
Try it

659
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:59,500
Something
Email only

660
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:02,500
But not from Alexi send

661
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:06,480
We know the time then, do not hesitate

662
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:08,240
Ready to go

663
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:22,570
He is not going to race? I hope this is the last

664
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:25,500
He will not race if you do not want

665
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:35,310
I can not let other people more involved
I have to settle for him to finish

666
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:44,890
He went out and put him down
now go away

667
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:53,820
I called a nurse now?
No, I only just a bit tired

668
01:17:56,500 --> 01:18:00,270
go go
I love you

669
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,770
I love you

670
01:18:06,980 --> 01:18:10,880
Rick, his careful
Why?

671
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:18,750
This place is boring
Do not worry, I will return soon

672
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:42,210
Is
Im going, to which it

673
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:06,130
Rick here, but thought not to

674
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:09,500
He found his new car yet?
Look sympathetically

675
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:14,470
Good racing there this place

676
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,270
Dark night drinking with friends watching airplanes
there are also good

677
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:22,520
What about the other guy back then the police?
There okay, racing is racing

678
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:27,580
This guy does not make the call the other guy
that's all going direct

679
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:29,020
We are racing every race

680
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:32,550
See you next time
Very good

681
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,770
Dammit

682
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:48,340
1 eagle 2 eagle call, this place is not
where we have to race it, then, go!

683
01:19:48,510 --> 01:19:52,780
Now we have to go it alone catch them, take any

684
01:19:57,790 --> 01:20:03,090

686
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,540
Nobody should try to keep track of all that went racing plug

687
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:20,840
Now be prepared to go any other boy

01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:16,780
You make me lose no money
You hurt me then clean bag Damn him

703
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:19,550
Now you're a guy causing problems for me there

704
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:22,450
Where he thinks he can go shooting
him with a gun he was

705
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:28,330
You're right, I can not but you shall have
Can it, shoot it

706
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:34,790
You have two options, I shoot it or you splashed eyes

707
01:23:37,010 --> 01:23:39,940
1, 2, 3.

708

Want to see on any network?
Call an ambulance right away

710
01:23:49,250 --> 01:23:51,780
Kayce, he considered what you

711
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:02,190
Now the stars, feeling how champions?

712
01:24:08,440 --> 01:24:12,310
You think you know what?
Kayce sure you want to give up

713
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:15,810
Now he is lucky in that I can not or do more

714
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:23,040
He thought I was stupid, though
Where do you do, can bring life back Tom

715
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:29,720
I have seen her dancing before?
in the strip club dancers are not you?

716
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:33,690
No, really dance, she dance very nice

717
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,640
Does anyone here now to see

01:25:00,090 --> 01:25:03,920
I congratulate you
Thank you

01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:06,490
This is ..
This is Kelly Garcia

720
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:10,200
Kelly is that tampering
I'm here

721
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:15,600
Come on, I have to do this for her children
I have no where white delivery

722
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:20,670
Well this is not the reaction he hoped a head start hard

723
01:25:21,850 --> 01:25:25,940
Where not make him hard
British customers

724
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:30,520
The Nazca management team, and he has told
he went hard

725
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:38,420
I'll think about it
Keep going away, but now I and you

726
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:40,530
We have not done a head start

727
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:44,890
I have heard you owe 400,000

728
01:25:45,540 --> 01:25:50,440
Discouraged to hear and know
I'm also here that Lu

729
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:56,940
I also heard that guy lost it and Kayce
And he has the car so its

730
01:25:57,650 --> 01:26:01,240
But to the car as it is also obsolete

731
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:07,150
I am also very sad about it
Oh you mean the guy stars

732
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:11,360
You mean you own a copy yourself? Ignore
suggestions for me?

733
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:17,370
And because of his promise, I will help him

734
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:22,340
And I wanted to try feel that vehicle too

735
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:29,250
Kacey feeling to see how it lines
So think about the price $ 100,000 go offline

736
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:34,740
The correct price for what you did there

737
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:39,790
Well I enjoyed the reaction it

Do not forget to take care of this car I know

741
01:26:54,340 --> 01:27:02,400
Then of course, is also a hand to fix it but

742
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:12,420
