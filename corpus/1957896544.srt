James! Thank you for coming.

was a property lawyer.

Yes. Which is why I'm so
happy that you're here alone.

all throughout high school.

out on a few dates?

109
00:04:52,965 --> 00:04:55,344
Yeah, but then he graduated

110
00:04:55,448 --> 00:04:57,965
and that was that.

111
00:04:58,068 --> 00:05:00,034

to Ashley Burke?

She's talking to him.

You know how Ashley is.

114
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:07,689
She'll just spout gossip to
whoever's in front of her.

115

turned this into

mom knew each other that well.

It's Rutledge. Everybody
knows everybody.

143
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,976
But you know my
relationship with your mom

144
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,586
is strictly professional.

She didn't tell you?

148
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:34,448
Uh, no. No, she did not.

149
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:36,931
Um, can you excuse me?

150
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:45,551
- You look ravishing, Mrs. Lee.
- Not so bad yourself, Mr. Lee.

151

you for a second?

looks so wonderful.

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,586
You really outdid
yourself, kiddo.

156

Thanks, Teddy. I'm really
happy for the two of you.

157
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,413
Oh, that reminds
me. Here, catch.

158
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:04,413
Congratulations, you're next.

159
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:06,965
Not unless you plan on
throwing me a husband

160
00:07:07,068 --> 00:07:08,344
to go along with this.

161
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:10,048
Also, not really fair
to the other girls.

162
00:07:10,103 --> 00:07:12,344
I'm gonna let their moms
worry about their futures.

163
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:16,034
And any guy would be
lucky to have you.

164
00:07:16,137 --> 00:07:18,206
Speaking of futures,
when you guys get back

165
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,344
from your honeymoon,

166
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:21,689
where should I be
forwarding your mail?

167
00:07:21,793 --> 00:07:24,206
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

168
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,172
Oh, honey, I have been so
caught up in this wedding.

169
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:28,655
I decided...

170
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:32,965
Well, we decided we don't
really need both houses.

171
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:35,413
And Teddy's place is in
the historic district

172
00:07:35,517 --> 00:07:36,793
and it has a pool.

173
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:39,482
David thought it
would be a great move.

174
00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:44,206
Did he? Well, um, well,
I would love to help.

175
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,586
Oh no, you've done
so much already

176
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:48,655
and I know how busy
you are at work.

177
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:50,310
Doing exactly this.

178
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:52,733
I stage homes for a living, so
that they're easier to sell.

179
00:07:52,793 --> 00:07:55,034
And I'm really good at it.

180
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:56,862
You really want to
help sell this place?

181
00:07:56,965 --> 00:07:59,965
Mom, of course. I
grew up in this house

182
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:02,413
and I wanna make sure that
it goes to the right buyer.

183
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:04,965
And besides you know that
I'm thinking of opening

184
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,241
my own office in the new
year and this would be a

185
00:08:07,344 --> 00:08:08,724
great first step.

186
00:08:08,827 --> 00:08:13,241
I'll just tell my boss that
I'm extending my vacation.

187
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:17,689
Well, if it's what
you want, sweetheart,

188
00:08:17,793 --> 00:08:20,275
but only if you work with David.

189
00:08:20,379 --> 00:08:22,551
He'll get his commission
and then you and I

190
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:24,034
will split the profit.

191
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:26,689
Oh, mom, no, that's too much.

192
00:08:26,793 --> 00:08:28,793
- No arguing with the bride.
- Okay.

193
00:08:28,896 --> 00:08:31,068
Oh, you two can get
started while we're away.

194
00:08:31,172 --> 00:08:34,241
<i>♪ Baby I love you</i>

195
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:39,172
<i>♪ So much that I found you</i>

196
00:08:40,413 --> 00:08:43,034
<i>♪ I'm so glad
that you're mine ♪</i>

197
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:46,862
<i>♪ Baby I love you</i>

198
00:08:46,965 --> 00:08:49,344
<i>♪ I truly love you</i>

199
00:08:51,206 --> 00:08:55,000
[sighs] [phone buzzing]

200
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:59,448
Yes, Caitlyn, I did
get the message.

201
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:03,379
Yep, I am going to
send it over right now.

202
00:09:03,896 --> 00:09:06,517
Yep, sending it
now. Okay. Bye.

203
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:13,965
[music]

204
00:09:47,758 --> 00:09:50,448
Oh my God, David, what
are you doing here?

205
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:54,206
Working. Taking
photos of the house.

206
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:58,103
Janice gave me the code.
She didn't tell you?

207
00:09:58,206 --> 00:10:01,965
No. That seems to
be a running theme.

208
00:10:04,965 --> 00:10:06,655
Let me.

209
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:09,551
I got it. Thanks.

210
00:10:09,655 --> 00:10:10,838
You looked like you needed help.

211
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:13,172
Yeah, about that,
I can take care of

212
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:15,103
getting the house ready to sell.

213
00:10:15,206 --> 00:10:17,379
All I need you to do is bring
me a buyer at Christmas.

214
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,827
Well, I promised your mom
she's my top priority.

215
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:21,034
She's my client.

216
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:23,620
And she's my mother
and this is my house.

217
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:26,758
And I just wanna make sure
that everything is done right.

218
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:29,448
Technically, this
is my house too.

219
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:31,551
I have the listing.

220
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:36,724
Right. Well, uh, you take
pictures of whatever you want

221
00:10:36,827 --> 00:10:38,931
and I'm gonna keep packing.

222
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:46,172
Christmas is ambitious,
but not impossible.

223
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:48,655
Hey, good thing it's
a seller's market.

224
00:10:48,758 --> 00:10:51,103
The house could sell as-is,
but with a little sweat equity,

225
00:10:51,206 --> 00:10:53,103
it would probably
boost the price.

226
00:10:53,206 --> 00:10:55,655
Ever thought about renovating?

227
00:10:55,758 --> 00:10:57,655
Honestly, I mean,

228
00:10:57,758 --> 00:11:00,000
the place has looked
exactly the same for so long

229
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:04,482
I guess I never imagined
it looking any different.

230
00:11:04,586 --> 00:11:08,068
Well, look up.

231
00:11:08,172 --> 00:11:09,724
Imagine it.

232
00:11:09,827 --> 00:11:13,689
Yeah, I guess it could
use a little sprucing up.

233
00:11:13,793 --> 00:11:15,241
But just a face-lift.

234
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:18,068
I don't wanna knock
down walls or anything.

235
00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:20,379
I definitely don't have the
time or the money for that.

236
00:11:20,482 --> 00:11:24,379
Well, sure. Purely cosmetic.
It'll still have a big impact.

237
00:11:24,482 --> 00:11:28,655
Yeah, and it's a family home so
I think it should be inviting,

238
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:30,172
but with a modern touch.

239
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:32,172
Just remember, what
works in Atlanta,

240
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,034
may not work here in Rutledge.

241
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:36,965
Okay, but you have to
admit Rutledge is a little

242
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:41,000
behind the times and outdated
doesn't work anywhere.

243
00:11:41,103 --> 00:11:42,862
Like the living
room, for instance.

244
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:44,793
I mean, we should
brighten it up in here.

245
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:48,482
<i>Lighten the walls, a new
rug, remove the blinds.</i>

246
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:51,827
<i>And we could bring in
modern, elegant furniture.</i>

247
00:11:51,931 --> 00:11:55,172
- Clean lines.
- Hmm.

248
00:11:55,275 --> 00:11:57,034
Hmm?

249
00:11:57,137 --> 00:11:59,655
I don't know. It has a
lot of Southern charm.

250
00:11:59,758 --> 00:12:01,320
Charm and character
are big selling points

251
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:03,620
in small-town markets.

252
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,758
We could embrace the
historic look, clean it up,

253
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:08,793
<i>get some big, comfy furniture.</i>

254
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,758
<i>I mean, it's the living
room. Let it live.</i>

255
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:14,137
[Mel] <i>I don't know. What if our
buyers aren't from around here?</i>

256
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:19,241
I think that we should go less
charm, more sophistication.

257
00:12:19,344 --> 00:12:23,827
Like the fireplace, I mean,
it's such a focal point.

258
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:28,620
I think that we should lose the
tile and probably the mirror.

259
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:30,758
And maybe paint the bricks.

260
00:12:30,862 --> 00:12:33,103
Oh, why don't we
keep the old bricks

261
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:35,310
and frame it with
a custom mantle?

262
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:37,241
That could be nice.
Do you think we could

263
00:12:37,344 --> 00:12:39,344
get something like
that done in time?

264
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:41,965
When in doubt,
call in an expert.

265
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:48,965
[phone ringing]

266
00:12:50,172 --> 00:12:52,931
David Phelps, as I
live and breathe.

267
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:57,689
And a Merry
Christmas to you too.

268
00:12:57,793 --> 00:13:01,482
Ah, I see you got
all your fingers.

269
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:04,172
Have you seen my glasses
'cause I just set them down?

270
00:13:04,275 --> 00:13:07,000
- Uh, your glasses?
- There they are.

271
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:09,206
Nice. Sarah's
there. Hey, Sarah.

272
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:13,344
David, hey. Merry
almost Christmas.

273
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:15,700
There's somebody I want you
guys to meet. This is Melissa.

274
00:13:15,724 --> 00:13:17,137
We went to high school together.

275
00:13:17,241 --> 00:13:19,586
We're working on selling her
mom's home here in Rutledge.

276
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:23,068
Melissa is a professional
home stager out of Atlanta.

277
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:24,551
Nice to meet you.

278
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:26,862
Yeah, it's good to meet you
too. What can we do for you?

279
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:30,241
Well, the house needs some
updating and right now

280
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,310
our main focus is the fireplace.

281
00:13:32,413 --> 00:13:34,206
Here, let me show you.

282
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:36,493
We're wanting to give
it a contemporary feel

283
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:38,137
without spending a fortune.

284
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:40,724
Uh-huh, I see what
you're trying to do.

285
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:44,310
Here's the thing. We're
in a bit of a rush.

286
00:13:44,413 --> 00:13:46,655
Yeah, we would need
it in like two weeks.

287
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:49,862
- Whew.
- Yeah, you can totally do that.

288
00:13:49,965 --> 00:13:52,655
Do you already have a
design like in mind?

289
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:55,896
Actually, I was hoping you
could help us with that too.

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,344
- Sarah is an incredible artist.
- Oh, stop.

291
00:14:00,448 --> 00:14:01,793
Yeah, we could do it.

292
00:14:01,896 --> 00:14:04,758
Could you just send us
more pictures to work from?

293
00:14:04,862 --> 00:14:06,931
I owe you guys so
big. Thank you.

294
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:09,724
Yeah, you do owe me big time,
but I got your back, buddy.

295
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:12,206
- Bye.
- All right. See y'all later.

296
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,275
Wow. Getting a custom piece
in the city on a time crunch

297
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:17,931
would be next to impossible.

298
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:20,586
Just one of the benefits
of living in a small town.

299
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:22,344
What about the
rest of the house?

300
00:14:22,448 --> 00:14:24,206
Follow me.

301
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:29,724
Well, this bathroom's
seen better days.

302
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,344
The question is how do
we do this on a budget?

303
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:34,827
Well, the wainscotting's
got to go.

304
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:36,458
I don't know. I think
that it could be trendy

305
00:14:36,482 --> 00:14:37,931
if it's done right.

306
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:40,103
And we could put wallpaper
behind the mirror.

307
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:42,068
Wallpaper? In the bathroom?

308
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,862
Wallpaper was in, then it was
out. Now it's back in again.

309
00:14:44,965 --> 00:14:46,758
What about the pedestal sink?

310
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:48,862
Well, it's not original
to the house so I think

311
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:50,379
<i>that it could go.</i>

312
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:51,769
<i>And we could get something
with more storage</i>

313
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:53,793
<i>and a brushed nickel faucet.</i>

314
00:14:53,896 --> 00:14:56,724
Well, let's redo the floor.
The tiles are in pieces.

315
00:14:56,827 --> 00:14:59,448
[Mel] <i>We could do
something with a pattern.</i>

316
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:03,413
I wouldn't go crazy with them
because I've seen it backfire.

317
00:15:03,517 --> 00:15:06,413
Well, I'm willing
to take the risk.

318
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:19,551
This room needs a lot of help.

319
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:22,310
Yeah, now that I'm seeing
it as a potential sale

320
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:24,448
and not where I used to
eat pancakes as a kid

321
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:25,896
and it really does.

322
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Let me guess, new cabinets?

323
00:15:28,103 --> 00:15:29,620
New everything.

324
00:15:29,724 --> 00:15:34,172
<i>New appliances, hardware,
and a completely new island,</i>

325
00:15:34,275 --> 00:15:37,482
<i>counter tops, new sink.</i>

326
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:39,448
This room could make
or break the sale.

327
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:42,344
Kitchens are at the top
of a buyer's wish list.

328
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:45,000
What about moving the table out

329
00:15:45,103 --> 00:15:47,827
and sliding in a breakfast
nook with benches?

330
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:49,793
Nooks are cute, but remember,

331
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:51,551
we're trying to
elevate the design.

332
00:15:51,655 --> 00:15:54,275
I'm thinking two club chairs
with a table in the middle.

333
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:57,448
<i>Somewhere where you can
drink coffee, read a book.</i>

334
00:15:57,551 --> 00:16:00,482
But this is a family
home. Kids love nooks.

335
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:05,241
Okay. Let's just table
this conversation for now.

336
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:07,620
I see what you did there.

337
00:16:09,206 --> 00:16:11,862
Hey, so all the bedrooms
need are new fixtures

338
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:13,344
and a new coat of paint.

339
00:16:13,448 --> 00:16:16,586
Here is where we have
the real heavy lifting.

340
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:19,551
Okay, so I'm thinking
we paint the door,

341
00:16:19,655 --> 00:16:23,586
fix the broken shutters, paint
the railings and the deck,

342
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:26,931
and then put two sconces
on either side of the door.

343
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:29,000
And let's do something
about these dead plants.

344
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:30,586
Never underestimate curb appeal.

345
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,241
I've seen a big
return on investment.

346
00:16:32,344 --> 00:16:34,620
Yeah, it's kind of a shame
we have to take all the

347
00:16:34,724 --> 00:16:38,034
Christmas decorations
down to show the house.

348
00:16:38,137 --> 00:16:41,275
Why? We don't have to.

349
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:44,034
You're right. People love
the Christmas spirit.

Okay, so here's
what I'm thinking.

352
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:52,034
We lose the two small trees.

00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:55,413
<i>We put a big tree in the
corner, fully decorated.</i>

354
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:58,551
<i>We can do lights in the
windows. And for our new mantle,</i>

355
00:16:58,655 --> 00:17:01,000
<i>we could keep the
lights and the garland,</i>

356
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,965
<i>and just add candles
and some stockings.</i>

00:17:06,206 --> 00:17:08,275
What do you think?

358
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:10,344
I think it sounds
like a lot of work.

359
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:12,413
Well, I have two
empty credit cards

360
00:17:12,517 --> 00:17:15,172
and two weeks paid vacation.

361
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,793
Still, we're gonna need help.

362
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:20,896
Which is why you're
going to help me.

363
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,896

Are you afraid to
get your hands dirty?

365
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:29,724
You're the one who
suggested renovations.

366
00:17:30,068 --> 00:17:31,517
I'll call in some favors.

367
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,827
I'll reach out to a
local contractor I trust.

368
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:35,838
He'll send over a few guys
and I could pull some comps

369
00:17:35,862 --> 00:17:37,172

370
00:17:37,275 --> 00:17:40,103
See if I can reappraise the
house based on our plans.

371
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:43,931
And I will make sure the
battle plan is all mapped out.

372
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,931
Remember at any given time
there are about 50 homes

374
00:17:48,551 --> 00:17:50,344
So we have to stand
out above the rest.

00:24:44,965 --> 00:24:49,586
Because I had, I had summer
school and he moved away

519
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:52,827
and we just stopped talking.

520
00:24:52,931 --> 00:24:55,827
You stopped talking, but you
clearly didn't stop feeling.

521
00:24:58,344 --> 00:25:03,103
Yeah, well, that was a long
time ago and I mean, it was,

522
00:25:03,206 --> 00:25:04,620
it was obviously nothing.

523
00:25:04,724 --> 00:25:08,896
Maybe, but maybe it
could be something now.

524
00:25:12,758 --> 00:25:13,907
Is there anything
about me in here?

525
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:16,000
Okay, you're done.

526
00:25:23,586 --> 00:25:27,137
- You need any help?
- No. I got it.

527
00:25:27,482 --> 00:25:29,344
Whoa.

528
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,206
You did get it, though.

529
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,896
Did I? It got me.

530
00:25:43,896 --> 00:25:45,936
All right, guys. You can
go ahead and take this too.

531
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,379
One, two, three.

532
00:25:55,517 --> 00:25:57,413
Okay and those
chairs over there.

533
00:25:57,517 --> 00:26:00,103
<i>♪ If I could have one wish</i>

534
00:26:00,206 --> 00:26:04,551
<i>♪ I would celebrate with you</i>

535
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:10,758
<i>♪ And wash away these
Christmas blues ♪</i>

536
00:26:12,034 --> 00:26:13,448
Here you go. Oh.

537
00:26:13,551 --> 00:26:17,137
<i>♪ If I could make it snow</i>

538
00:26:17,241 --> 00:26:21,413
<i>♪ Pass presents
to people I know ♪</i>

539
00:26:21,517 --> 00:26:23,827
Tell your mom I said hello.

540
00:26:25,275 --> 00:26:28,275
Wow, I could not do this
without you. Seriously.

541
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,862
Are you kidding?
This is my Superbowl.

542
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:33,827
Hey, you. Ready to go? The
kids are in the car waiting.

543
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:35,079
Still meeting us
for dinner, right?

544
00:26:35,103 --> 00:26:36,482
Yeah, of course.

545
00:26:36,586 --> 00:26:38,079
Thank you so much for
letting me borrow her today.

546
00:26:38,103 --> 00:26:40,620
She killed it and she made
a lot of people happy.

547
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,862
She makes me happy every day.

548
00:26:42,965 --> 00:26:44,355
I thought it only fair
that other people get

549
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:45,482
to experience it too.

550
00:26:45,586 --> 00:26:49,482
- Aw, thanks, babe.
- Of course.

551
00:26:49,586 --> 00:26:52,103
- All done?
- Yeah, it looks like it.

552
00:26:52,206 --> 00:26:54,458
- How's it going inside?
- Good. The guys are cleaning up.

553
00:26:54,482 --> 00:26:57,517
That's great. The stuff for the
thrift store is in your truck.

554
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,034
We're gonna head to dinner.

555
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:01,424
Do you mind dropping off the
donations on your way downtown?

556
00:27:01,448 --> 00:27:03,310
No. Not at all.

557
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,000
You guys are going
downtown because?

558
00:27:06,103 --> 00:27:09,724
We are going downtown
because it's the second

559
00:27:09,827 --> 00:27:11,586
Friday of December.

560
00:27:11,689 --> 00:27:13,517
Nog-Fest.

561
00:27:13,862 --> 00:27:15,620
Nog-Fest.

562
00:27:15,724 --> 00:27:18,344
Nog-Fest, Nog-Fest, Nog-Fest.

563
00:27:18,448 --> 00:27:24,068
Okay, okay. I take it
we're going to Nog-Fest.

564
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:35,724
Do you ever wonder why
it's called eggnog?

565
00:27:35,827 --> 00:27:38,551
'Cause there's
eggs in it. Duh.

566
00:27:38,655 --> 00:27:41,551
Yeah, but it's not like there
are any other kinds of nog.

567
00:27:41,655 --> 00:27:45,517
There's not like
butter-nog or grape-nog.

568
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,655
Or frog-nog.

569
00:27:47,758 --> 00:27:50,862
- Eww.
- Eww. That's yucky.

570
00:27:50,965 --> 00:27:53,517
Oh, I'm the picky one because
I don't like cauliflower,

571
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,724
but you're grossed out over a
drink that doesn't even exist?

572
00:27:56,827 --> 00:27:58,344
I want frog-nog.

573
00:27:58,448 --> 00:28:03,551
See, she gets it. Come on,
princess. Let's find you some.

574
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:05,793
- I'll catch up with y'all later.
- All right.

575
00:28:05,896 --> 00:28:08,896
Hey, add a splash of beer
and you could call it kegnog.

576
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,379
Hmm. No.

577
00:28:15,448 --> 00:28:16,931
- What's up, guys?
- Hey, guys.

578
00:28:17,034 --> 00:28:18,965
Hello.

579
00:28:19,068 --> 00:28:20,448
Didn't this used
to be a pet store?

580
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:22,793
You need to come
home more often.

581
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:24,827
That was at least
four visits ago.

582
00:28:24,931 --> 00:28:28,275
You missed a psychic, a
Yarn-Topia, and a bait shop.

583
00:28:28,379 --> 00:28:30,103
Right in the middle
of Main Street.

584
00:28:30,206 --> 00:28:32,000
It only lasted a
couple of weeks.

585
00:28:32,103 --> 00:28:35,448
Yeah, we're still finding dead
crickets in the backroom. Joy.

586
00:28:35,551 --> 00:28:38,896
A spice shop is certainly
niche for a small town.

587
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,137
You'd be surprised.
We sell a lot online,

588
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:44,827
but come cookout season, we do
gang-busters right here in town.

589
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,793
People take their
spice rub real serious.

590
00:28:47,896 --> 00:28:50,758
Apparently their eggnog too, but
you guys are a clear favorite.

591
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,103
I'll take some.

592
00:28:52,206 --> 00:28:54,241
- It's actually store bought.
- Got it.

593
00:28:54,344 --> 00:28:56,517
Cheaters.

594
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,586
It's all about the presentation.

595
00:28:58,689 --> 00:29:00,355
All right. We'll catch you
guys later. Merry Christmas.

596
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:02,551
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

597
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:05,111
[David] <i>This does not
taste like kegnog.</i>

598
00:29:05,206 --> 00:29:06,631
[Mel] <i>You got whipped
cream. I didn't.</i>

599
00:29:06,655 --> 00:29:08,724
Oh, it's 'cause
mine is frog-nog.

600
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:10,896
Laurie's gonna
have another baby.

601
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,586
Yeah, but you're not
supposed to know that though.

602
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:16,529
You just told me. Anyway
what are you drinking?

603
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:17,803
Which one is yours?
This is kegnog.

604
00:29:17,827 --> 00:29:19,079
I don't know, but you
got whipped cream.

605
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:20,689
- I have kegnog.
- That's not a thing.

606
00:29:20,793 --> 00:29:22,862
[phone chimes]

607
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:29,758
Uh, oh great. That
is my boss, Caitlyn.

608
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:32,793
Since when did
bosses just assume

609
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,896
that their employees
are on call 24/7?

610
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,172
Around the same time
everyone got cell phones.

611
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:40,310
You can't be on call if
you don't have a phone.

612
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:43,344
- Well, this is true.
- Shoulda come home sooner.

613
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,689
Up until six months ago,

614
00:29:44,793 --> 00:29:47,827
the whole west side of
town was a dead zone.

615
00:29:47,931 --> 00:29:50,172
Well, that sounds like a dream.

616
00:29:50,275 --> 00:29:54,517
It's still kind of
spotty. Missed call.

617
00:29:55,965 --> 00:29:58,689
[sighs] I gotta go. I'll
catch up with you later.

618
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:00,827
What?

619
00:30:01,793 --> 00:30:03,655
I heard he has a girlfriend.

620
00:30:03,758 --> 00:30:06,827
Oh, Ashley. Hi.
Yeah, look, I don't,

621
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:08,896
I don't really want
to hear any gossip.

622
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,310
Oh, it's not gossip.
It's common knowledge.

623
00:30:11,413 --> 00:30:13,173
I mean, he gets calls
like that all the time.

624
00:30:13,275 --> 00:30:15,241
Always whispering like
it's some big secret.

625
00:30:15,344 --> 00:30:17,965
Well, he is a real estate agent,

626
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:20,517
so it could just
be business calls.

627
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,965
From clients he whispers to?
Uh-huh. Look, I'm just saying,

628
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:27,413
you should be careful.

629
00:30:27,517 --> 00:30:30,482
Well, I appreciate it.
But I don't really care

630
00:30:30,586 --> 00:30:32,551
that he has a girlfriend.

631
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:35,689
Fine. I'm sure there's a
perfectly good explanation.

632
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:39,172
There always is. Ta-ta.

633
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,034
- There you are.
- Hey.

634
00:30:43,137 --> 00:30:44,517
Ah, all right.

635
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,586
Wow. How much nog have you had?

636
00:30:46,689 --> 00:30:50,827
Oh. None 'cause of this
little guy or girl.

637
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:53,551
So you're gonna
drink them for me.

638
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:57,862
- All of these?
- Every last one.

639
00:30:57,965 --> 00:31:02,931
And I wanna hear about the
flavors and the smoothness.

640
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:06,310
- And does the mouth feels?
- The mouth feels?

641
00:31:06,413 --> 00:31:07,665
Well, 'cause some
of them are spicy.

642
00:31:07,689 --> 00:31:10,413
Spicy? Eggnog is
spicy? Okay, which one?

643
00:31:10,517 --> 00:31:12,103
Let's go with this
one, this red one.

644
00:31:12,206 --> 00:31:15,655
- Okay.
- Yes. Smell. Drink it slow.

645
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:17,631
- What do you think?
- It's creamy.

646
00:31:17,655 --> 00:31:20,137
- Mm-hmm.
- Is it thick?

647
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:23,206
- We like it thick.
- Do we?

648
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,689
You know I'm probably going
to get like really sick.

649
00:31:25,793 --> 00:31:27,724
Yeah, I don't care. Put
it down. Try another one.

650
00:31:27,827 --> 00:31:29,320
- Okay. This one has handles.
- I know.

651
00:31:29,344 --> 00:31:31,068
They knew what they were doing.

652
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:35,655
So I know it was
a bit of a drive,

653
00:31:35,758 --> 00:31:38,068
but this place has
everything we need.

654
00:31:38,172 --> 00:31:40,275
That couch is perfect.

655
00:31:41,172 --> 00:31:45,275
This is great for
the living room.

656
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:48,551
But shouldn't we sit on it?
What if it's uncomfortable?

657
00:31:48,655 --> 00:31:50,551
It doesn't matter
if it's comfortable.

658
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:52,620
It matters how it looks.

659
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:54,931
You want the buyer to be
able to visualize themselves

660
00:31:55,034 --> 00:31:56,379
in the space.

661
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:58,113
And believe it or not,
rooms actually look bigger

662
00:31:58,137 --> 00:32:00,413
with furniture in them.

663
00:32:01,862 --> 00:32:07,000
For me, all I need is a big,
comfy seat and I'm happy.

664
00:32:07,103 --> 00:32:08,344
[sighs]

665
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,872
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
go look at some pieces

666
00:32:09,896 --> 00:32:12,172
that I thought would be
good for the bedroom.

667
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:15,275
- Okay.
- Are you coming?

668
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:18,896
This is so comfy. Okay,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

669
00:32:22,655 --> 00:32:27,275
So I'm thinking one of these in
each corner opposite the door.

670
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:29,344
I never really liked
standing lamps.

671
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,872
The only benefit is
that you can move them,

672
00:32:30,896 --> 00:32:32,034
but no one ever does.

673
00:32:32,137 --> 00:32:33,562
Might as well put a
light on the wall.

674
00:32:33,586 --> 00:32:36,034
I think you're thinking
too much about this.

675
00:32:36,137 --> 00:32:37,665
You're the one trying to
decide between basically

676
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,275
two identical lamps.

677
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:41,448
The lamps have to look
good with the chairs.

678
00:32:41,551 --> 00:32:43,275
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

679
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:46,206
I believe you. I just
happen to sell over 50 homes

680
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,510
and never dressed any of them.

681
00:32:47,586 --> 00:32:49,482
Oh, is that so? Well,
you're missing out

682
00:32:49,586 --> 00:32:52,620
because staged homes
sell for 10 to 15% more

683
00:32:52,724 --> 00:32:55,448
and in half the time.

684
00:32:56,137 --> 00:32:59,000
So let's talk about this
lamp. How much is this? Nice.

685
00:33:02,724 --> 00:33:05,068
Hey, let me call you back.

686
00:33:07,793 --> 00:33:09,241
How'd it go?

687
00:33:09,344 --> 00:33:11,596
Well, assuming that everything
is in stock at the warehouse,

688
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,413
we're good for a
delivery on the 22nd.

689
00:33:14,517 --> 00:33:16,448
It's all starting to feel real.

690
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:20,827
- Point of no return, huh?
- Something like that. Yeah.

691
00:33:21,689 --> 00:33:26,034
Um, by the way, where did
you disappear to last night?

692
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:29,241
- I tried to find you, but...
- Yeah, I...

693
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,596
I was dealing with something at
home. I should've texted you.

694
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,379
I'm so sorry. Did you
have fun at least?

695
00:33:33,482 --> 00:33:34,896
Oh, yeah.

696
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,044
Yeah, I forgot how much I
love Rutledge at Christmas.

697
00:33:37,068 --> 00:33:40,344
Yeah, it's pretty special.

698
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:44,344

- Yeah.

- How was the honeymoon?
- Beautiful. You have no idea.

I wanted to stay forever.

Did you have any trouble
finding the place?

710
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,517
No. I didn't know that
this was Teddy's house.

711
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,275
I remember driving by it all
the time when I was a kid.

712
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:25,275
I wish I'd have visited sooner.

713
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,896
Oh well, you're here
now. That's what matters.

Wow, you weren't kidding
about the trains.

715
00:34:31,689 --> 00:34:35,310
Well, what can I say? I'm a
man who knows what he likes.

- Welcome to Christmasville.
- Teddy's quite the collector.

720
00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:56,000
I've been a rail fan pretty
much most of my life.

721
00:34:56,103 --> 00:34:58,827
Now some of this was my father's
who handed it down to me.

722
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:00,137
Do you wanna give it a spin?

723
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:03,137
I-I don't really know
how to drive a train.

724
00:35:03,241 --> 00:35:05,620
That's okay. There's rails.

725
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:08,896
Okay. Is it this one?

726
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,517
Yeah.

727
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:18,310
Mom, hand me your
plate. Oh, no, no, no.

728
00:35:18,413 --> 00:35:20,517
You're the guest. You
can't be doing the dishes.

729
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,551
Really? Well, you forced me
to do the dishes for 20 years,

730
00:35:24,655 --> 00:35:26,415
so it's pretty much
hard-wired at this point.

731
00:35:26,517 --> 00:35:28,827
Okay, well then I'm
helping. No, no, no, no.

732
00:35:28,931 --> 00:35:31,655
Both of you, give
me your plates.

733
00:35:31,758 --> 00:35:34,517
I will do the dishes

734
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,517
and let the two of you catch up.

735
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,344
Well, I am not going
to fight you on that.

736
00:35:38,448 --> 00:35:40,551
Thanks, Teddy.

737
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:48,241
You seem really happy,
mom. Teddy's great.

738
00:35:48,344 --> 00:35:51,000
He's a big ole goof,

739
00:35:51,103 --> 00:35:54,137
but he's my goof.

740
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:56,586
He's good for me.

I was done with relationships.

sudden, there's Teddy.

didn't know was missing.

That's really sweet.

Well, sometimes you just have to
be open to the idea of romance.

You know that bouquet? It
wilted after a few days, right?

748
00:36:26,448 --> 00:36:28,620
Still counts.

749
00:36:29,344 --> 00:36:31,896
You know that David sure
is handsome, isn't he?

750
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,448
- Mom.
- It's just an observation.

751
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:39,413
Well, we're just working
together and besides

752
00:36:39,517 --> 00:36:41,103
David has a girlfriend.

753
00:36:41,206 --> 00:36:43,241
He didn't have a
date at the wedding.

00:36:43,344 --> 00:36:44,551
Are you sure?

755
00:36:44,655 --> 00:36:47,000
It doesn't matter because
after Christmas I'm going

756
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:50,758
back to Atlanta and he's
never leaving Rutledge, so...

757
00:36:50,862 --> 00:36:56,034
Yeah, and I was never gonna
move out of that old house.

- Hey. I love your shirt.

766
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:34,793
Is it forest green?

767
00:37:34,896 --> 00:37:36,586
Yeah, it's one of
my favorite colors.

768
00:37:36,689 --> 00:37:38,172
- Me too.
- Good eye.

769
00:37:38,275 --> 00:37:40,793

bit of a color expert.

something right now?

No, no. Not at all.

772
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:46,931
Well, I've got the first draft
on a drawing of the mantle.

773
00:37:47,034 --> 00:37:49,655
- Do you wanna see?
- Uh, yes.

774
00:37:49,758 --> 00:37:53,137
Okay. Okay, it's a
little more traditional

775
00:37:53,241 --> 00:37:54,344
than what we discussed.

776
00:37:54,448 --> 00:37:57,655
- That's great!
- Good. While I've got you,

777
00:37:57,758 --> 00:38:01,068
I wonder how you feel
about a porch swing

778
00:38:01,172 --> 00:38:03,044
'cause David showed me a picture
of the front of the house

779
00:38:03,068 --> 00:38:05,275
and I feel kind of like
something's missing.

780
00:38:05,379 --> 00:38:09,275
- Um, I love it.
- Excellent. We have one problem.

this is gonna fit

783
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,068
No, no. It's all right.

00:38:13,172 --> 00:38:15,172
We'll drive down to
you and pick them up.

785
00:38:15,275 --> 00:38:17,344
Yeah, sure. I mean, I
would love to meet you two

786
00:38:17,448 --> 00:38:19,000
and see the shop.

787
00:38:19,103 --> 00:38:20,827
Good. I think that
would be really fun.

788
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:22,862

much. Can't wait.

what are we doing here?

00:38:43,344 --> 00:38:45,379
Well, I figured we've
been working double time

797
00:38:45,482 --> 00:38:48,413
the last few days and I
thought we deserved a break.

798

made any sense to me.

Everybody's wearing a Santa

wanted to be a jock.

- Oh, hey. I'm here.
- Hey, why don't you go in

need for the doors upstairs?

a couple of minutes,

but um, you guys know David.
I really want to get him

a thank you gift for all the
hard work that he's put in.

842
00:41:35,482 --> 00:41:36,896
Do you have any ideas?

843
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,241
Actually, I think that he
would love a singing bass.

00:41:40,344 --> 00:41:43,034
That's what you want.
There is one thing.

really nice business cards.

846
00:41:46,724 --> 00:41:48,206
I could design some.

Yeah, that would be, that would
be great. It's professional.

- Can I ask you two a question?
- Mm-hmm.

What was it like starting
your own business?

We always wanted to
have a family business.

It was something that we
wanted to do together.

Um, but in the beginning
there was no money.

00:42:07,172 --> 00:42:10,724
We were spending money and we
didn't really have any clients.

854
00:42:10,827 --> 00:42:12,896
And it was terrifying.

855
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,310
But we always knew that
it was the right thing

856
00:42:16,413 --> 00:42:18,103
even when it was terrifying.

857
00:42:18,206 --> 00:42:20,482
One day it stopped
being terrifying

858
00:42:20,586 --> 00:42:22,862
and then it became really great.

859
00:42:22,965 --> 00:42:25,689
And we've never
regretted it, ever.

860
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,172
Mm-mm.

861
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:34,689
So yeah, I think that
we should do the red.

862
00:42:34,793 --> 00:42:38,344
Red? For the mantle?
No, for the...

863
00:42:38,448 --> 00:42:41,413
Cupcakes. I'm making
cupcakes when y'all come.

864
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:44,793
We were talking
about icing colors.

865
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:48,931
Yeah, that. Um, I actually have
to go inside and get the pins

866
00:42:49,034 --> 00:42:50,379
for the doors upstairs, so...

867
00:42:50,482 --> 00:42:54,103
Isn't that what you
just told me to go get?

868
00:42:54,206 --> 00:42:57,586
Right. Sorry. Um, I actually
have to get something next door,

869
00:42:57,689 --> 00:43:01,137
but thank you. And
I'll talk to you soon.

870
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:03,586
- All right. See you, Mel.
- Bye.

871
00:43:06,206 --> 00:43:09,586
Sarah, hey, I may need
your help with something,

872
00:43:09,689 --> 00:43:11,379
but don't tell Mel.

873
00:43:11,482 --> 00:43:13,517
- Ooh.
- Okay.

874
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,965
[hammering]

875
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:21,620
- Feels good.
- Close it.

876
00:43:23,206 --> 00:43:27,551
- Hmm, feels kind of tight.
- Let me try.

877
00:43:31,551 --> 00:43:33,310
Whoops.

878
00:43:36,379 --> 00:43:38,931
I think we're stuck.

879
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:41,000
Well, call Bernard.

880
00:43:42,448 --> 00:43:44,689
[line trilling]

881
00:43:44,793 --> 00:43:47,310
<i>You've reached Bernard.
Leave a message.</i>

882
00:43:47,413 --> 00:43:51,344
Bernard's not picking up.
We could go out on the roof.

883
00:43:51,448 --> 00:43:54,586
No, that's an accident
waiting to happen.

884
00:43:54,689 --> 00:43:56,827
Ooh, we could call 911.

885
00:43:56,931 --> 00:43:59,931
We're not gonna call
911 to open the door.

886
00:44:00,034 --> 00:44:01,413
Call Gloria.

887
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:03,010
No. She's in the middle of
an ultrasound right now.

888
00:44:03,034 --> 00:44:06,724
[signs] Let's just take a break.

889
00:44:06,827 --> 00:44:09,344
I didn't put any
breaks in the schedule.

890
00:44:09,448 --> 00:44:11,379
Remind me again whose
boss keeps pestering her

891
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,758
to work during vacation.

892
00:44:13,862 --> 00:44:16,862
Yeah, you're right.
[clears throat]

893
00:44:16,965 --> 00:44:19,724
[both sigh]

894
00:44:20,241 --> 00:44:23,000
So how did you get into
selling houses anyway?

895
00:44:23,103 --> 00:44:25,275
I thought you went to
college for engineering.

896
00:44:25,379 --> 00:44:28,517
I did, but only for a year.

897
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,517
Oh, didn't like it?

898
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:33,551
I loved it, but when I
came back for spring break,

899
00:44:33,655 --> 00:44:35,896
I realized what me
going to school meant

900
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
for my entire family.

901
00:44:39,793 --> 00:44:41,586
Do you remember
my brother, Alex?

902
00:44:41,689 --> 00:44:43,724
I remember you having a
brother, but I don't think

903
00:44:43,827 --> 00:44:45,344
that I ever met him.

904
00:44:45,448 --> 00:44:48,206
Yeah, we didn't go
to school together.

905
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:52,344
My brother Alex has ASD.

906
00:44:52,448 --> 00:44:55,241
And it's been super
challenging for my parents.

907
00:44:55,344 --> 00:44:56,941
Growing up, I didn't really
think about it because

908
00:44:56,965 --> 00:44:59,896
he was my little brother.
I'd look out for him.

909
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,068
But, you can't do that
if you're not home.

910
00:45:02,172 --> 00:45:03,692
I mean, my parents
never said anything,

911
00:45:03,758 --> 00:45:08,172
but when I'd go back to visit, I
could see that they were tired.

912
00:45:08,275 --> 00:45:09,734
They didn't have the
money to hire someone

913
00:45:09,758 --> 00:45:11,344
and I was gonna be
gone for four years.

914
00:45:11,448 --> 00:45:14,068
So you left college?

915
00:45:14,172 --> 00:45:16,758
I finished freshman year.

916
00:45:16,862 --> 00:45:19,758
And over the summer,
I took a job.

917
00:45:19,862 --> 00:45:22,137
Didn't expect to
like it so much.

918
00:45:22,241 --> 00:45:25,103
So you were back in
Rutledge just as...

919
00:45:25,206 --> 00:45:28,965
You were leaving. Yeah.

920
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:34,241
I remember you wanting
to go to the city

921
00:45:34,344 --> 00:45:37,103
and make a name for yourself.

922
00:45:37,206 --> 00:45:40,758
I was really happy
to hear you did it.

923
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:46,275
I, uh, I thought I might go
back and finish up my degree,

924
00:45:46,379 --> 00:45:49,586
but I realized I liked my job.
Helping families find a home.

925
00:45:49,689 --> 00:45:51,586
Welcome them to the community.

926
00:45:51,689 --> 00:45:55,344
Wow, that's like the
exact opposite of my job.

927
00:45:55,448 --> 00:45:57,965
My boss is all
about the big sale.

928
00:45:58,068 --> 00:46:01,310
Investment properties
for the ultra rich.

929
00:46:01,413 --> 00:46:03,653
You know there's this one
property that I've dressed five

930
00:46:03,724 --> 00:46:05,965
times in the last three years.

931
00:46:06,068 --> 00:46:08,379
And no one every moves
into it. It just...

932
00:46:08,482 --> 00:46:10,103
The price keeps going up.

933
00:46:10,206 --> 00:46:11,827
You don't sound satisfied.

934
00:46:11,931 --> 00:46:15,689
I like what I do. Seeing
the potential of a place,

935
00:46:15,793 --> 00:46:21,206
but I just... I wish that just
for once, someone would say,

936
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:24,689
yes, this is what I want.

937
00:46:24,793 --> 00:46:28,172
I finally found what
I've been looking for.

938
00:46:29,724 --> 00:46:32,689
I know that feeling.

939
00:46:33,965 --> 00:46:36,758
[phone buzzing]

940
00:46:39,724 --> 00:46:42,344
I um, I need to take this.

941
00:46:44,517 --> 00:46:45,717
I'll just take it on the roof.

942
00:46:45,758 --> 00:46:46,931
- What?
- Yeah.

943
00:46:47,034 --> 00:46:50,827
What? David, what
are you? Don't!

944
00:46:54,758 --> 00:46:58,103
Hey Candice, yeah, it's
David. I'm here. I'm here.

945
00:46:58,206 --> 00:46:59,655
Is he next to you?
How's it going?

946
00:46:59,758 --> 00:47:01,827
Oh.

947
00:47:03,068 --> 00:47:07,137

948
00:47:16,862 --> 00:47:19,344

Wow, the king of DIY.

960
00:47:57,517 --> 00:47:59,448
Hey, tried to tell ya.

961
00:47:59,551 --> 00:48:01,217
I knew I would be. You
didn't want to listen.

962
00:48:01,241 --> 00:48:03,793
You said you didn't do DIY.

963
00:48:03,896 --> 00:48:05,336
You know, I'm just
full of surprises.

964
00:48:05,379 --> 00:48:07,000
You are.

965
00:48:08,103 --> 00:48:10,034
All right, all
right. Watch it.

966
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:13,172
Ready? Push down with
me. Watch your fingers.

967
00:48:13,275 --> 00:48:14,803
- I won't get your hand.
- You know what?

968
00:48:14,827 --> 00:48:16,907
You seem like you have it
under control, so I'm just...

969
00:48:16,931 --> 00:48:18,251
Can I get you some
lemonade or something?

970
00:48:18,275 --> 00:48:20,355
- Yeah, yeah. Would you mind?
- That'd be nice. Yeah.

971
00:48:22,413 --> 00:48:23,448
Ah.

972
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:26,931
No, I didn't get
your hand, did I?

973
00:48:32,206 --> 00:48:34,758
You can just take that
right to the living room.

974
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:36,344
Fancy.

975
00:48:36,448 --> 00:48:38,128
Yeah, it's gonna be
the kind of house I can

976
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,655
envision myself living in.

977
00:48:39,758 --> 00:48:42,172
You know you lived here
for like 20 years, right?

978
00:48:42,275 --> 00:48:44,515
Yeah and if it looked like
this, I might have never left.

979
00:48:44,551 --> 00:48:46,275
Ah.

980
00:48:47,206 --> 00:48:49,965
Hey, follow me. I'll
show you where that goes.

981
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:55,000
[music]

982
00:49:13,275 --> 00:49:15,758
All right, guys. Let's
go. Time is money.

983
00:49:18,482 --> 00:49:20,344
Wow.

984
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:26,862
I hardly recognize the
place. It looks so different.

985
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:31,517
Well, good different, I hope.
We're not quite finished yet.

986
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:36,172
- When is it going on the market?
- Christmas Eve.

987
00:49:36,275 --> 00:49:40,413
- Oh, you are so good.
- Well, I had a lot of help.

988
00:49:40,517 --> 00:49:41,896
We make a good team.

989
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,068
We still have some
custom pieces to pick up.

990
00:49:44,172 --> 00:49:47,103
And JB and Bernard still have
some things on their checklist,

991
00:49:47,206 --> 00:49:49,862
but we can finally
see the finish line.

992
00:49:49,965 --> 00:49:51,285
Well, I think we
should celebrate.

993
00:49:51,310 --> 00:49:54,689
Well, we will. We're
gonna have a party.

994
00:49:54,793 --> 00:49:58,413
Not that kind of
party. Um, follow me.

995
00:50:06,206 --> 00:50:09,206
- A fake tree?
- Yeah, no loose needles,

996
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:10,910
no bald spots, and
it's easy to take down

997
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,241
once the place is sold.

998
00:50:12,344 --> 00:50:14,724
But does it smell
like a Christmas tree?

999
00:50:14,827 --> 00:50:17,689
I thought of that, so I
got a bunch of these to put

1000
00:50:17,793 --> 00:50:19,068
on the back of the tree

1001
00:50:19,172 --> 00:50:22,517
and a bunch of ornaments
to put on the front.

1002
00:50:22,931 --> 00:50:24,586
- Let's get Christmasy.
- All right.

1003
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,413
Come on.

1004
00:50:33,620 --> 00:50:35,586
- Hello, hello.
- Hey.

1005
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:38,724
- I brought a little helper.
- Terrific. Hi, Daphne.

1006
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,931
- Daphne.
- She's a little shy today.

1007
00:50:42,034 --> 00:50:45,000
Where do you want us to start?
While he is working on the tree,

1008
00:50:45,103 --> 00:50:47,655
you wanna help me
organize ornaments?

1009
00:50:47,758 --> 00:50:49,862
Hey, that sounds pretty good.

1010
00:50:52,137 --> 00:50:55,482
I got the other ornaments
out of the attic.

1011
00:50:56,758 --> 00:51:00,931
Oh, Mel, look.

1012
00:51:01,034 --> 00:51:04,103
I think you were what, about
8 or 9 when you made that.

1013
00:51:04,206 --> 00:51:07,000
Yeah, I remember that.
Grandma Alice taught me how.

1014
00:51:07,103 --> 00:51:10,586
I used to love putting that
on the tree every year.

1015
00:51:10,689 --> 00:51:12,527
You know what? Why don't you
take that and the whole box

1016
00:51:12,551 --> 00:51:13,793
with you to Teddy's?

1017
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:15,482
You're not gonna
put any on the tree?

1018
00:51:15,586 --> 00:51:18,689
No, I mean, not this one.
It's really important with

1019
00:51:18,793 --> 00:51:22,068
home staging that you don't
leave anything sentimental

1020
00:51:22,172 --> 00:51:24,079
or personal in the house
because you want the buyer

1021
00:51:24,103 --> 00:51:27,896
to be able to envision
themselves living there.

1022
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,896
Well, lucky for us then, right?

1023
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,793
I'll just go put
these in my car.

1024
00:51:36,758 --> 00:51:40,000
So I'm guessing more of these?

1025
00:51:40,103 --> 00:51:45,655
Yes. Classic, neutral, but with
a touch of holiday sparkle.

1026
00:51:45,758 --> 00:51:49,103
Hey Daphne, would you like to
help Uncle David hang one up?

1027
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:50,448
- Yeah.
- Here.

1028
00:51:53,241 --> 00:51:56,758
Where? Show me. There?
Go. All right. Go.

1029
00:51:56,862 --> 00:51:58,413
You got it?

1030
00:51:59,931 --> 00:52:02,793
- Boop.
- There you go, baby.

1031
00:52:03,137 --> 00:52:04,827
Make it rain.

1032
00:52:05,896 --> 00:52:09,137

1040
00:52:38,482 --> 00:52:43,551
It's pretty, but is
it a Christmas tree?

1041
00:52:44,206 --> 00:52:46,551
What? Of course, it is.

1042
00:52:46,655 --> 00:52:49,724
It just feels like it doesn't
belong to anyone in particular.

1043
00:52:49,827 --> 00:52:52,827
Well, it belongs with
the, the new furniture

1044
00:52:52,931 --> 00:52:55,689
and the new kitchen,
and the new house.

1045
00:52:55,793 --> 00:52:57,206
No, you're right.

1046
00:52:57,310 --> 00:53:01,344
I'm just used to the
popcorn and the tinsel,

1047
00:53:01,448 --> 00:53:04,620
and the homemade ornaments.

1048
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:08,172
Well, that's what the
tree at Teddy's is for.

1049
00:53:08,724 --> 00:53:12,413
- What's up, honey?
- There's no presents.

1050
00:53:12,517 --> 00:53:15,310
You know what,
Daphne? You're right.

1051
00:53:15,413 --> 00:53:19,758
And we need presents, so mom,
do you think that you could

1052
00:53:19,862 --> 00:53:23,896
maybe wrap some fake presents?

1053
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,344
Oh, I think I do a little
bit better than that.

1054
00:53:33,482 --> 00:53:35,931
Today was great.

1055
00:53:37,137 --> 00:53:39,034
I'll be here early
tomorrow to pick you up.

1056
00:53:39,137 --> 00:53:40,537
I told the guys to
take the day off,

1057
00:53:40,586 --> 00:53:42,586
so they can get some
rest for the final push.

1058
00:53:42,689 --> 00:53:44,862
Sounds good. See you tomorrow.

1059
00:53:44,965 --> 00:53:47,241
- All right. Good night.
- Night.

1060
00:53:47,896 --> 00:53:50,517
- Gloria.
- Night, David.

1061
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,241
Daphne's asleep in the car.

1062
00:53:52,344 --> 00:53:53,458
Thank you so much for your help.

1063
00:53:53,482 --> 00:53:54,931
Are you kidding me?

1064
00:53:55,034 --> 00:53:57,044
We should be thanking you for
keeping us out of the house.

1065
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:58,758
You know, kids are
way better one on one.

1066
00:53:58,862 --> 00:54:01,382
Well, enjoy while you can 'cause
you're about to be outnumbered.

1067
00:54:01,482 --> 00:54:05,137
Oh, don't remind me.

1068
00:54:07,896 --> 00:54:12,137
So tomorrow's the big day, huh?

1069
00:54:12,896 --> 00:54:18,206
You and David, road trip?
Ah, it's just a work day.

1070
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:20,413
Just like every other day.

1071
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:24,034
And it's just a couple
of hours there and back.

1072
00:54:24,137 --> 00:54:27,586
A couple of hours
in a truck, alone,

1073
00:54:27,689 --> 00:54:29,551
nothing to do except

1074
00:54:29,655 --> 00:54:32,551
talk about the
future or the past.

1075
00:54:32,655 --> 00:54:36,137
You sound like my mother.
Janice is a wise woman.

1076
00:54:36,241 --> 00:54:39,758
Nothing is gonna happen
because David has a girlfriend.

1077
00:54:39,862 --> 00:54:42,793
Wait, really? He
never told me.

1078
00:54:42,896 --> 00:54:46,000
Same, which means he's
not mentioning her

1079
00:54:46,103 --> 00:54:48,034
because he doesn't see
me that way, red flag.

1080
00:54:48,137 --> 00:54:51,172
Or he's keeping her a secret
because he's a player,

1081
00:54:51,275 --> 00:54:52,586
double red flag either way.

1082
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,827
Here I thought he
was a normal guy.

1083
00:54:54,931 --> 00:54:57,310
Wait, that sounds exactly
like a normal guy.

1084
00:54:57,413 --> 00:55:00,827
It doesn't even matter
because in two days the buyers

1085
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:03,000
are gonna come here and
then all that's left to do

1086
00:55:03,103 --> 00:55:05,689
is email paperwork
and sign a big check.

1087
00:55:05,793 --> 00:55:07,724
Both things that I
can do from Atlanta.

1088
00:55:07,827 --> 00:55:10,172
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I kind of hope you can't

1089
00:55:10,275 --> 00:55:13,068
sell it for two more trimesters.

1090
00:55:13,172 --> 00:55:14,655
- Good night, mama.
- Night, hun.

1091
00:55:14,758 --> 00:55:16,551
- Love you.
- Love you more.

1092
00:55:22,482 --> 00:55:26,000
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1093
00:55:27,482 --> 00:55:29,172
Ready to hit the road?

1094
00:55:29,275 --> 00:55:32,551
The depends, do I get
to pick the tunes?

1095
00:55:32,655 --> 00:55:34,896
Driver picks the tunes.

1096
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,206
You have got to be kidding me.

1097
00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:38,896
Come on. It's gonna be fun.

1098
00:55:40,896 --> 00:55:42,172
<i>Vamanos.</i>

1099
00:55:43,551 --> 00:55:45,068

- Gloria owes me 20 bucks.
- What?

1103
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:05,379
She thought you could
make it through one song,

1104
00:56:05,482 --> 00:56:08,310
but you didn't.

1105
00:56:08,413 --> 00:56:10,172
I didn't know there
were bets being made.

1106
00:56:10,275 --> 00:56:13,344
Gloria has to pay up.

1107

[Mel] <i>Hey, this is about to be

- Ready. Yep. I missed this.

1113
00:56:34,413 --> 00:56:37,689
Come on. They don't have
fried chicken in Atlanta?

1114
00:56:37,793 --> 00:56:40,034
Well, they do,
but not like this.

1115
00:56:40,137 --> 00:56:42,827
We used to come here every
year when we were on our way

1116
00:56:42,931 --> 00:56:44,103
to my grandparent's house.

1117
00:56:44,206 --> 00:56:47,448
- Just for the food?
- Yes, just for the food.

1118
00:56:47,551 --> 00:56:50,172
You know, you've always known
how to get what you want.

1119
00:56:50,275 --> 00:56:51,758
What do you mean?

1120
00:56:51,862 --> 00:56:54,413
Well, all through school, if
you put your mind to something,

1121
00:56:54,517 --> 00:56:55,965
you always knew how to get it.

1122
00:56:56,068 --> 00:56:58,827
Like when you ran for
student body president

1123
00:56:58,931 --> 00:57:01,344
as a junior and won.

1124
00:57:01,448 --> 00:57:03,482
That was impressive.
I really admired that.

1125
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,068
And now with the house.

1126
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:08,862
You set this crazy deadline
and yet here we are.

1127
00:57:08,965 --> 00:57:11,448
- Eat your food.
- I'm gonna eat.

1128
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:19,551
- Mm.
- Yeah?

1129
00:57:19,655 --> 00:57:21,103
- Delicious.
- Told you.

1130
00:57:21,206 --> 00:57:22,551
Amazing.

1131
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:25,655
And with the house stuff, I
mean, I had a lot of help.

1132
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:27,379
I couldn't have done
it without you guys.

1133
00:57:27,482 --> 00:57:28,631
I'm sure you
would've found a way.

1134
00:57:28,655 --> 00:57:31,482
Yeah, but just because
I would've had to.

1135
00:57:31,586 --> 00:57:33,482
I'm going to Atlanta with
or without the money.

1136
00:57:33,586 --> 00:57:36,827
I would really prefer with.

1137
00:57:40,482 --> 00:57:45,724
By the way, what is this?
You did it with Henry.

1138
00:57:45,827 --> 00:57:51,551
Oh, oh, oh. It's noodling.
That's how I met Henry.

1139
00:57:51,655 --> 00:57:53,206
What is noodling?

1140
00:57:53,310 --> 00:57:56,655
All right, you go to the water,
you find some rocks or roots,

1141
00:57:56,758 --> 00:57:58,758
anywhere they can hide.

1142
00:57:58,862 --> 00:58:03,965
You stick your hand in until the
catfish gets mad and bites you.

1143
00:58:04,068 --> 00:58:07,586
- What? Why?
- That's how you catch it.

1144
00:58:07,689 --> 00:58:10,379
When he gets mad and it
bites you, you grab it.

1145
00:58:10,482 --> 00:58:13,758
So it's like fishing. I mean,
technically it is fishing.

1146
00:58:13,862 --> 00:58:16,379
- Then why not use a rod?
- No, oh, no, no.

1147
00:58:16,482 --> 00:58:18,758
These are not like little
baby fish we're talking about.

1148
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:21,758
My personal best
was a 42 pounder.

1149
00:58:21,862 --> 00:58:24,310
Henry caught a 72 pounder.

1150
00:58:24,413 --> 00:58:27,068
Can you imagine wrestling
with that thing in the mud?

1151
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:28,965
What?

1152
00:58:32,379 --> 00:58:36,379
None of what you just
said made any sense to me.

1153
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:44,482
You know, you have
a great laugh.

1154
00:58:44,586 --> 00:58:46,827
What?

1155
00:58:46,931 --> 00:58:49,793
Yeah, it's the kind of laugh
people want to join in.

1156
00:58:49,896 --> 00:58:51,413
It's a good laugh.

1157
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:55,931
Thanks.

1158
00:58:56,034 --> 00:58:57,827
You're welcome.

1159
00:59:04,793 --> 00:59:10,689
- Well, here we are.
- Wood you look at that? Cute.

1160
00:59:10,793 --> 00:59:13,931
You expect anything less
from Sarah and Henry?

1161
00:59:14,034 --> 00:59:16,241
No, absolutely not.

1162
00:59:20,758 --> 00:59:24,241
[saw buzzing]

1163
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:30,206
- Ho, ho, ho!
- Oh my gosh!

1164
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:34,724
David! Melissa! It's so good
to meet in person finally.

1165
00:59:34,827 --> 00:59:37,827
- Yes. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1166
00:59:37,931 --> 00:59:40,931
You too. You guys
are still doing this.

1167
00:59:41,034 --> 00:59:43,379
- We always will.
- Oh I just learned what that is.

1168
00:59:43,482 --> 00:59:45,344
- Yeah, are you a noodler?
- Now I am.

1169
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:47,827
- Let's see what you got.
- Oh, you've been practicing.

1170
00:59:47,931 --> 00:59:50,034
I hear ya. I like it.

1171
00:59:50,137 --> 00:59:52,034
Let's go show them what
we've been working on.

1172
00:59:52,137 --> 00:59:54,068
- What have we been working on?
- It's so good.

1173
00:59:54,172 --> 00:59:55,275
- Oh, yes.
- Do you?

1174
00:59:55,379 --> 00:59:56,838
- Yeah.
- What have we been working on?

1175
00:59:56,862 --> 01:00:00,482
I feel like I'm back home,
guys. The place hasn't changed.

1176
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:05,482
Y'all ain't ready. I'm
about to blow your mind.

1177
01:00:05,586 --> 01:00:06,586
Okay.

1178
01:00:06,689 --> 01:00:08,010
Wait. Shouldn't it
be more dramatic?

1179
01:00:08,034 --> 01:00:09,758
It definitely needs
to be more dramatic

1180
01:00:09,862 --> 01:00:10,872
'cause it's gonna be dramatic.

1181
01:00:10,896 --> 01:00:13,586
Here we go. Booya!

1182
01:00:13,689 --> 01:00:16,931
Wow. You guys, it's perfect.

1183
01:00:17,034 --> 01:00:18,103
Do you really like it?

1184
01:00:18,206 --> 01:00:19,448
Oh, shoot. My phone died.

1185
01:00:19,551 --> 01:00:21,044
Can you, can you take a
picture on your phone?

1186
01:00:21,068 --> 01:00:23,000
I have so many pictures

I'm really proud of
how it turned out.

1188
01:00:24,965 --> 01:00:28,000
I went with mahogany
because it's gonna be

1189
01:00:28,103 --> 01:00:29,803
against a fireplace and
I thought about you know,

1190
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:32,517
shrinking and the heat
drying it out and everything.

1191
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:36,310
And I used all um,
mortis and tenon joints,

1192
01:00:36,413 --> 01:00:37,551
and I used domino joints.

1193
01:00:37,655 --> 01:00:39,758
And then these are
hand-carved flutes

1194
01:00:39,862 --> 01:00:41,931

or we'll be here all night.

to go back and try it out.

1201
01:00:59,517 --> 01:01:01,527

be said for a cold glass of

1202
01:01:01,551 --> 01:01:04,241
lemonade on a front porch swing.

1203
01:01:04,344 --> 01:01:05,724
Or a cold beer.

01:01:05,827 --> 01:01:08,172
If it's on the front porch,
it's gotta be sweet tea.

same in their own unique way.

is why we love it so much.

01:08:40,827 --> 01:08:43,310
No, no. I don't need it
New Year's. I need it now.

1352
01:08:43,413 --> 01:08:45,694
Hey, look. I don't know what
to tell you, lady, all right?

1353
01:08:45,724 --> 01:08:47,172
We gotta hit the road.

1354
01:08:47,275 --> 01:08:49,527
No, look. Look, there's been
a mistake. You can't do this.

1355
01:08:49,551 --> 01:08:51,275
I didn't cancel the order.

1356
01:08:51,379 --> 01:08:53,000
Hey, maybe it was
a clerical error.

1357
01:08:53,103 --> 01:08:55,517
Like I said, take it up
with the main office.

1358
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:59,206
And when you call,
ask about the tree.

1359
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:02,448
I'm sure they'll reimburse you.
All right, let's go. Wrap it up.

1360
01:09:02,551 --> 01:09:04,586
What? The tree?

1361
01:09:04,689 --> 01:09:06,000
The tree!

1362
01:09:14,551 --> 01:09:17,344
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1363
01:09:17,448 --> 01:09:18,793
Okay, we can clean this up.

1364
01:09:18,896 --> 01:09:21,896
- Let me find a broom.
- No, what is the point?

1365
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,413
I can't redress the
whole place by tomorrow.

1366
01:09:24,517 --> 01:09:28,758
- No, but you could.
- No, David, stop! Please!

1367
01:09:28,862 --> 01:09:32,620
I know you're just trying to
help, but you're not, okay?

1368
01:09:32,724 --> 01:09:37,758
Can you just give me a
minute alone, please?

1369
01:09:38,517 --> 01:09:42,275
Yeah. Whatever you need.

1370
01:09:46,758 --> 01:09:52,206
[music]

1371
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:54,965
I just feel like a failure.

1372
01:09:55,068 --> 01:09:58,344
Somehow they got the digits
wrong for the credit card.

1373
01:09:58,448 --> 01:10:00,931
They couldn't
reach me to verify.

1374
01:10:01,034 --> 01:10:03,551
And they had a code to the
house, so they just came

1375
01:10:03,655 --> 01:10:05,758
and took away all the furniture.

1376
01:10:05,862 --> 01:10:07,655
Uh-oh.

1377
01:10:07,758 --> 01:10:09,518
If I can't even do this,
how am I supposed to

1378
01:10:09,551 --> 01:10:12,068
run my own business?

1379
01:10:12,172 --> 01:10:14,517
What do successful people say?

1380
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:15,965
Fake it til you make it.

1381
01:10:16,068 --> 01:10:18,551
Well, that's because they
haven't interviewed the tons

1382
01:10:18,655 --> 01:10:22,275
of unsuccessful people that
faked it and went broke.

1383
01:10:22,379 --> 01:10:25,448
I might as well just
cancel the buyers.

1384
01:10:25,551 --> 01:10:29,965
I'm not gonna have enough
time to clean the place up

1385
01:10:30,068 --> 01:10:31,758
and they're gonna low ball us.

1386
01:10:31,862 --> 01:10:33,965
So? If they do,
you turn them down.

1387
01:10:34,068 --> 01:10:38,793
I can't. I've maxed out all my
credit cards. We're out of time.

1388
01:10:38,896 --> 01:10:41,862
And besides, the house,
the house doesn't even

1389
01:10:41,965 --> 01:10:44,310
feel like home anymore.

1390
01:10:44,413 --> 01:10:47,206
At least not the
home I grew up in.

1391
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:50,724
Honey, the house was never home.

1392
01:10:50,827 --> 01:10:53,724
Home isn't a building.

1393
01:10:53,827 --> 01:10:56,551
Home is family.

1394
01:10:56,655 --> 01:10:58,758
It's community.

1395
01:10:58,862 --> 01:11:01,034
Home is the people who love you.

1396
01:11:01,137 --> 01:11:04,758
It's a lot more than
walls and a roof.

1397
01:11:04,862 --> 01:11:08,793
The house needed
some sprucing up.

1398
01:11:08,896 --> 01:11:11,689
I still don't see
any train tracks.

1399
01:11:12,758 --> 01:11:14,793
Thank you, guys.

1400
01:11:16,344 --> 01:11:18,275
[sighs] I'm sorry
I let you down.

1401
01:11:18,379 --> 01:11:21,896
Oh. Never.

1402
01:11:32,379 --> 01:11:36,551
[phone buzzing]

1403
01:11:40,310 --> 01:11:43,000
Oh, it's Christmas Eve, Caitlyn.

1404
01:12:01,965 --> 01:12:05,344
- Morning.
- Morning.

1405
01:12:05,448 --> 01:12:08,896
- Happy Christmas Eve.
- You too.

1406
01:12:09,724 --> 01:12:11,448
I'm really sorry
about last night.

1407
01:12:11,551 --> 01:12:13,827
I was upset and frustrated
and I didn't mean

1408
01:12:13,931 --> 01:12:15,827
to take it out on you.

1409
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:17,344
No worries.

1410
01:12:17,448 --> 01:12:18,808
I hope that you
called those buyers

1411
01:12:18,862 --> 01:12:20,620
and told them not to bother.

1412
01:12:20,724 --> 01:12:23,931
I didn't because we
will find a solution.

1413
01:12:24,034 --> 01:12:27,000
Does that involve you running me
over repeatedly with your truck?

1414
01:12:27,103 --> 01:12:29,103
That was plan B.

1415
01:12:29,206 --> 01:12:30,803
I hate to admit it,
but being in the city

1416
01:12:30,827 --> 01:12:33,010
would probably help right now.
I bet there's a ton of vendors

1417
01:12:33,034 --> 01:12:36,172
and stores we could call in
a pinch, but here it's...

1418
01:12:36,275 --> 01:12:38,344
No, you just gave me an idea.

1419
01:12:38,448 --> 01:12:40,689
What was it that Henry
said about small towns?

1420
01:12:40,793 --> 01:12:42,793
How people couldn't care more.

1421
01:12:42,896 --> 01:12:45,931
We could put that
theory to the test.

1422
01:12:46,034 --> 01:12:48,275
We have some phone
calls to make.

1423
01:12:52,551 --> 01:12:57,931
Hey, a dresser and two lamps.
All right. Great. Got it.

1424
01:12:58,034 --> 01:13:01,413
Okay. I talked to the
buyers. I got us a few hours.

1425
01:13:01,517 --> 01:13:02,896
They're still coming.

1426
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,160
That's great and since all
the stores are closed today,

1427
01:13:05,241 --> 01:13:07,793
Gloria put out a call on social
media and I'm already getting

1428
01:13:07,896 --> 01:13:10,896
tons of photos from
people all over town.

1429
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,068
It's like an eclectic
digital showroom.

1430
01:13:13,172 --> 01:13:14,724
It's kind of brilliant.

1431
01:13:14,827 --> 01:13:16,241
Mel, you gotta come see this!

1432
01:13:16,344 --> 01:13:18,148
People are already starting
to show up with their items.

1433
01:13:18,172 --> 01:13:21,275
It's incredible. And on
Christmas Eve no less.

1434
01:13:21,379 --> 01:13:23,896
What'd I tell you? Rutledge
takes care of its own.

1435
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,724
Give me some. Boom!

1436
01:13:25,827 --> 01:13:28,000
Well, honey, go, go. I
can handle things here.

1437
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:30,172
Come on. The clock is ticking.

1438
01:13:30,275 --> 01:13:34,172
[phone ringing]
Norwood residence.

1439
01:13:34,275 --> 01:13:37,068
Yeah, yeah. What do you got?

1440
01:13:46,862 --> 01:13:52,103
Wow. This is amazing. Thank
you so much for being here.

1441
01:13:52,206 --> 01:13:54,172
It means the world to us.

1442
01:13:54,275 --> 01:13:56,206
If you've already had
your items preselected,

1443
01:13:56,310 --> 01:13:58,586
you can follow me
and David inside.

1444
01:13:58,689 --> 01:14:01,137
And if you're still waiting
to get eyes on your piece,

1445
01:14:01,241 --> 01:14:03,482
Gloria is your girl.

1446
01:14:03,586 --> 01:14:06,586
Uh, we only have a few hours,
but I really do think that

1447
01:14:06,689 --> 01:14:09,206
we can make a Christmas
miracle happen.

1448
01:14:09,310 --> 01:14:11,448
Thank you so much.

1449
01:14:11,551 --> 01:14:12,724
Let's do this.

[people clapping]

1451
01:14:18,931 --> 01:14:22,068
If I haven't seen your piece,
go ahead and bring it up here.

1452
01:14:22,172 --> 01:14:23,803
That looks great, you can
go ahead and take that in.

1453
01:14:23,827 --> 01:14:25,827
Thank you so much.

1454
01:14:27,551 --> 01:14:29,448
Hey guys, good to see you.

1455
01:14:29,551 --> 01:14:31,862
That looks great.

1456
01:14:31,965 --> 01:14:34,379
That could go right here.

1457
01:14:34,482 --> 01:14:38,206
Hey. Um, right there. Thanks.

1458
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,448
Um, that can go over there.

A tree? That's

Nope. It's yours. I
got it from the lot.

I snuck away when
you weren't looking.

It's a real Christmas tree

Hey guys. Can you believe this?

1494
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:09,068
What? You've never seen a whole
town come together and blitz

1495
01:16:09,172 --> 01:16:12,517

Girl, you need to get out more.

1496
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:14,010
We figured everyone else
had furniture covered,

1497
01:16:14,034 --> 01:16:17,034
so we are bringing the spice.

1498
01:16:17,137 --> 01:16:19,010
Christmas potpourri. Your
house is gonna look great,

1499

but it's gonna smell amazing.

01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:23,758
Yes, it is. Let's get
that to the kitchen.

Ooh, love the
swing. It's so cute.

1502

Okay, guys. Let's wrap it up.
The buyers will be here soon.

1503
01:16:46,379 --> 01:16:49,689
- Wow, this looks great.
- You look great.

1504
01:16:49,793 --> 01:16:52,482
- Thanks.
- I think we did it.

1505
01:16:52,586 --> 01:16:54,137
Yeah, I think we did.

1506
01:16:54,241 --> 01:16:57,275
Now let's hope the buyers
love it as much as we do.

1507
01:16:58,931 --> 01:17:01,310
<i>Wow, this was a
massive transformation.</i>

- [Melissa] <i>We were both right.</i>

1512
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:13,413

was a new coat of paint.</i>

love from our neighbors.</i>

went with the patterned tile.</i>

wallpaper too. It's in.</i>

1517
01:17:25,827 --> 01:17:29,275
<i>And the mantle is the
perfect finishing touch.</i>

1518
01:17:29,379 --> 01:17:32,931
Everyone, I don't even
know how to thank you,

1519
01:17:33,034 --> 01:17:36,724
but what you've done here today
is nothing short of amazing.

1520
01:17:36,827 --> 01:17:39,413
You have shown the true
heart of this community

1521
01:17:39,517 --> 01:17:42,379
and I couldn't be prouder
to be a part of it.

1522
01:17:42,482 --> 01:17:45,034
Thank you from the
bottom of my heart.

1523
01:17:45,137 --> 01:17:48,896
And I'm just, I'm just so
grateful to all of you.

1524
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,448
Bryce, Candy. [clears throat]

1525
01:17:52,551 --> 01:17:54,551
Thank you so much for coming.

1526
01:17:54,655 --> 01:17:56,310
No trouble finding
the place, I hope?

1527
01:17:56,413 --> 01:17:58,689
Well, it's a bit further
out than we thought.

1528
01:17:58,793 --> 01:18:01,965
You drive a car like that,
what's a few extra miles, huh?

1529
01:18:02,068 --> 01:18:04,379
Well, come on. Let me
show you the place.

1530
01:18:04,862 --> 01:18:06,586
Why are there so
many people here?

1531
01:18:06,689 --> 01:18:09,137
We had a kind of send off
for the previous owner.

1532
01:18:09,241 --> 01:18:11,620
Speaking of, this is Melissa.
She grew up in this house.

1533
01:18:11,724 --> 01:18:14,034
You don't say.

1534
01:18:15,241 --> 01:18:19,000
Uh, Merry Christmas Eve.
Please let us show you around.

1535
01:18:29,931 --> 01:18:33,068
So a lot of what you'll see
has been recently updated,

1536
01:18:33,172 --> 01:18:35,137
but we still managed to
keep some of the orignal

1537
01:18:35,241 --> 01:18:38,379
character of the house.

1538
01:18:38,482 --> 01:18:40,172
Interesting.

1539
01:18:40,275 --> 01:18:42,793
Why don't we start
with this room?

1540
01:18:48,172 --> 01:18:50,758
So this is the only bedroom
on the main level, but...

1541
01:18:50,862 --> 01:18:53,172
Sorry, what's the
square footage again?

1542
01:18:53,275 --> 01:18:58,965
It's a three bedroom, two bath,
approximately 2,700 square feet.

1543
01:19:03,137 --> 01:19:07,206
Huh, quaint. What else?

1544
01:19:16,896 --> 01:19:20,758
As you'll see, we kept
the original beams.

1545
01:19:20,862 --> 01:19:24,379
And these are new
countertops, new fixtures,

1546
01:19:24,482 --> 01:19:27,206
new floors and appliances.

1547
01:19:30,517 --> 01:19:32,655
Let's show you the next room.

1548
01:19:35,241 --> 01:19:37,000
Well, we saved
the best for last.

1549
01:19:37,103 --> 01:19:40,310
This mantle is custom made
by a very talented craftsman.

1550
01:19:40,413 --> 01:19:42,827
Both he and his wife made
the swing on the front porch.

1551
01:19:42,931 --> 01:19:45,620
Are all the furnishings
being moved out?

1552
01:19:45,724 --> 01:19:47,310
Uh, well, that depends.

1553
01:19:47,413 --> 01:19:49,896
Um, if you see anything
that you like, we could...

1554
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,137
Oh, no, no, no. We
want it all gone.

1555
01:19:53,241 --> 01:19:54,700
Why don't we give you
guys a couple of minutes

1556
01:19:54,724 --> 01:19:56,689
to talk in private?

1557
01:19:56,793 --> 01:19:59,517
Let us know if you
have any questions.

1558
01:20:08,448 --> 01:20:10,000
[Bryce] This'll be easy.

1559
01:20:12,517 --> 01:20:15,068
- They hate it.
- No, they don't.

1560
01:20:15,172 --> 01:20:17,344
They're just playing it up,
so they don't seem eager.

1561
01:20:17,448 --> 01:20:18,896
I've seen this before.

1562
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,103
Well, they're very good at
pretending that they hate it.

1563
01:20:22,206 --> 01:20:26,793
Will you stop doubting yourself?
You did an amazing job.

1564
01:20:26,896 --> 01:20:29,482
We did an amazing job.

1565
01:20:29,586 --> 01:20:31,655
[clears throat]

1566
01:20:31,758 --> 01:20:34,793
See? That wasn't long
at all. After you.

1567
01:20:37,793 --> 01:20:40,310
So?

1568
01:20:40,413 --> 01:20:43,482
We'll take it. And we're
prepared to pay cash.

1569
01:20:43,586 --> 01:20:44,793
That's amazing.

1570
01:20:44,896 --> 01:20:47,827
But you have to come
way down on the price.

1571
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:50,137
- Well, why is that?
- Costs.

1572
01:20:50,241 --> 01:20:52,344
It's gonna cost me 50 grand
to knock this place down

1573
01:20:52,448 --> 01:20:54,088
and then there's the
money I have to spend

1574
01:20:54,137 --> 01:20:56,965
- putting in a new house.
- You wanna tear it down?

1575
01:20:57,068 --> 01:21:01,241
New house, you know,
instead of this one.

1576
01:21:01,344 --> 01:21:04,448
This property is worth
a lot, but this place...

1577
01:21:04,551 --> 01:21:07,000
It's all a little small
townish if you ask me.

1578
01:21:07,103 --> 01:21:11,103
Oh my, that's
exactly what it is.

1579
01:21:11,206 --> 01:21:14,793
- Well, I don't know if...
- No, I do. I know.

1580
01:21:14,896 --> 01:21:20,586
Small townish. Well, guess
what? It's in a small town.

1581
01:21:20,689 --> 01:21:23,862
Rutledge isn't the kind of place
that has hundreds of restaurants

1582
01:21:23,965 --> 01:21:26,413
or exclusive clubs,

1583
01:21:26,517 --> 01:21:29,068
but what it does have is heart.

1584
01:21:29,172 --> 01:21:32,068
The people here, they
look out for each other

1585
01:21:32,172 --> 01:21:34,482
and they're not just your
neighbors, they're your family.

1586
01:21:37,344 --> 01:21:39,206
You can't buy your
way into this family.

1587
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:40,965
Shh, quiet.

1588
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:42,596
[Melissa] <i>And I don't care
how many zeros you put</i>

1589
01:21:42,620 --> 01:21:44,206
<i>at the end of your check.</i>

1590
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:46,275
Oh.

1591
01:21:46,379 --> 01:21:48,620
I guess what I'm saying is,

1592
01:21:48,724 --> 01:21:51,931
unfortunately, the house
is no longer for sale.

1593
01:21:58,379 --> 01:22:00,499
They're not gonna get it.
Oh wait. They're coming out.

1594
01:22:00,551 --> 01:22:02,758
They're coming out. They're
coming out. Act natural.

1595
01:22:13,206 --> 01:22:15,827
I don't disagree, but I'm
not sure we'll find another

1596
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,862
big city buyer before
the end of the year.

1597
01:22:18,965 --> 01:22:22,137
That's okay. I changed my mind.

1598
01:22:22,241 --> 01:22:24,758
- You're not selling?
- No, I am selling,

1599
01:22:24,862 --> 01:22:28,034
just not to a person who
can't appreciate this place.

1600
01:22:28,137 --> 01:22:32,793
I think that we need a
growing family that can

1601
01:22:32,896 --> 01:22:36,068
care about the house
and the community.

1602
01:22:36,172 --> 01:22:37,965
[clears throat]

1603
01:22:38,068 --> 01:22:40,758
Us? We can't afford this place.

1604
01:22:40,862 --> 01:22:43,206
You need a bigger place.

1605
01:22:43,310 --> 01:22:46,172
And I have an in
with the seller.

1606
01:22:46,275 --> 01:22:48,034
I could get you a deal.

1607
01:22:48,137 --> 01:22:51,413
Mel, the whole reason why you
did all of this is so that way

1608
01:22:51,517 --> 01:22:53,793
you could take the money
and go back to Atlanta

1609
01:22:53,896 --> 01:22:55,103
and start your business.

1610
01:22:55,206 --> 01:22:58,137
Oh, I am starting my business.

1611
01:22:58,241 --> 01:23:01,965
Just not in Atlanta.

1612
01:23:02,068 --> 01:23:04,379
Caitlyn can have all
the big city clients.

1613
01:23:04,482 --> 01:23:06,275
I'm gonna conquer a new market.

1614
01:23:06,379 --> 01:23:08,275
And plus, I know a
real estate agent

1615
01:23:08,379 --> 01:23:13,137
who really needs a
good home stager.

1616
01:23:13,241 --> 01:23:17,206
I have to admit the place
looks better when it's dressed.

1617
01:23:17,310 --> 01:23:20,344
Uh, what do you say?
You want a new house?

1618
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:23,655
As long as we keep the swing.

1619
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:27,172
Are you sure Janice is
gonna be okay with this?

1620
01:23:27,275 --> 01:23:31,896
I'm more than okay
with it. I'm relieved.

1621
01:23:33,517 --> 01:23:35,758
We can cut the price
out of my half.

1622
01:23:35,862 --> 01:23:38,413
Mom still gets her commission
and the house basically

1623
01:23:38,517 --> 01:23:41,310
stays in the family.

1624
01:23:41,931 --> 01:23:44,068
Um...

1625
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,620
Thank you.

1626
01:23:49,448 --> 01:23:52,000
And Merry Christmas.

1627
01:23:54,793 --> 01:23:57,103
Oh, but you know you still
need to give all the stuff

1628
01:23:57,206 --> 01:23:59,758
back to the original owners.

1629
01:23:59,862 --> 01:24:02,827
Well, except the Christmas tree.

1630
01:24:02,931 --> 01:24:05,068
It's the only
thing that matters.

1631
01:24:06,551 --> 01:24:09,206
Look, it's snowing!

1632
01:24:10,068 --> 01:24:11,827
[excited chatter]

1633
01:24:15,724 --> 01:24:19,862
So I guess you're
sticking around?

1634
01:24:19,965 --> 01:24:23,172
Yeah, I guess I
am. And you know,

1635
01:24:23,275 --> 01:24:26,689
I'm gonna need a real estate
agent to find me a new place.

1636
01:24:26,793 --> 01:24:29,862
Hmm, only if you
answer one question.

1637
01:24:29,965 --> 01:24:31,448
Hmm, what is that?

1638
01:24:31,551 --> 01:24:35,724
Ashley's been spreading this
rumor that you have a boyfriend.

1639
01:24:35,827 --> 01:24:38,965
Is that true?

1640
01:24:43,172 --> 01:24:45,000
It is now.

1641
01:24:47,241 --> 01:24:53,206
[music]

1642
01:25:11,068 --> 01:25:13,172
Hey, how about a refill, huh?

1643
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:16,034
- Thanks.
- Thanks, mom.

1644
01:25:16,758 --> 01:25:19,551
Chase, you wanna help me in the
kitchen with the hot chocolate?

1645
01:25:19,655 --> 01:25:21,517
- Yes!
- Come on.

1646
01:25:26,517 --> 01:25:30,275
So... I got you a
little something.

1647
01:25:32,172 --> 01:25:35,379
- Oh, I didn't know we were...
- No, it's okay.

1648
01:25:35,482 --> 01:25:38,689
I took a swing. Just open it.

1649
01:25:46,172 --> 01:25:48,344
Wow, my first business card.

1650
01:25:48,448 --> 01:25:49,724
When did you?

1651
01:25:49,827 --> 01:25:52,862
Sarah designed them.
I may have made a few

1652
01:25:52,965 --> 01:25:56,620
sneaky phone calls when
you weren't looking.

1653
01:25:57,448 --> 01:25:59,793
- Do you like them?
- I love it.

1654
01:26:00,586 --> 01:26:04,241
It's funny because Sarah
helped me with yours too.

1655
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,344
Now home can be with
you wherever you are.

1656
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:15,137
It's perfect.

1657
01:26:16,448 --> 01:26:18,344
Thank you.

1658
01:26:23,793 --> 01:26:25,896
- She's really good.
- She is.

1659
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,068
- She kept the swing.
- And the red door.

1660
01:26:29,172 --> 01:26:31,206
- Wow.
- Christmas lights.

1661
01:26:31,310 --> 01:26:35,068
Yeah, well, you know, it has
to be able to be up year round.

1662
