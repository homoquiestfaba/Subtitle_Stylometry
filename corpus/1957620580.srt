1
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:50,180
Señora,Havana Libre.

2
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:52,748
It was before the Hilton.

3
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,445
Gracias, señor.

4
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,887
Bienvenida a Havana,  
señora.

5
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:03,063
Welcome to Havana,
señora.

6
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:17,077
So, you are of Canada?

7
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,600
United States.

8
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:20,210
Ah, United States.

9
00:01:20,254 --> 00:01:22,256
So, for what do you
go to Cuba?

10
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,257
Family.

11
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,216
Ah, family.

12
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,217
Gracias.

13
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:28,523
De nada.

14
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:48,934
[distant chanting]

15
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:31,151
Thanks.

16
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,213
What did I say?

17
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,565
Can't sail without
the captain, Papa.

18
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:57,220
That's the point.
We're going to be late.

19
00:02:57,264 --> 00:02:59,701
Keeping up on things,
hmm?

20
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:01,485
Are you packed?

21
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:02,834
Almost.

22
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:05,576
Almost packed.
Almost on time.

23
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,187
Mama!

24
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:13,845
I was afraid I
wouldn't catch you.

25
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:16,239
You know how long it
takes Papa to get ready.

26
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:19,242
Did you come all this way
to spy on us, my dear?

27
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:22,202
I always wonder what 
you're up to, Heinrich.

28
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,420
I'm just an
innocent sailor.

29
00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:26,293
Daggers and cloaks
I leave to you.

30
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,859
Are you coming with us,
Mama?

31
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:30,558
Oh, no, no. I'm just here
for the weekend.

32
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:32,995
They're flying me
out on Monday.

33
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:34,823
Saving the free world
again, my dear?

34
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:36,738
Very noble.
Marita, please hurry up.

35
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:39,001
I wanted to see you
before you sailed.

36
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:40,263
Please get my luggage.

37
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:42,526
Remember what
we talked about.

38
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,485
Is that why
you're here?

39
00:03:44,528 --> 00:03:46,791
Well, I think it's--

40
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:49,794
Can't this wait, Alice?
We really have to leave.

41
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:51,492
Well, yes, of course.

42
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:53,102
When you get back, you'll
come down to Washington,

43
00:03:53,145 --> 00:03:55,800
and I'll introduce you
to the division chief

44
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:57,280
and when you finish
your secretarial course--

45
00:03:57,324 --> 00:03:59,543
Why do you both want me
to be a secretary so much?

46
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:01,676
Darling, it's been four
years that you haven't
been in school,

47
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,286
which hasn't been
my preference,

48
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,680
but we both agree that
you have to make a choice.

49
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:07,247
Why?

50
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,683
Because it's time you thought

51
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:09,814
about where you belong
and what you want to do.

52
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,033
Where I belong?

53
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:12,469
You're just going to
float around

54
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:13,644
like a vagabond
for the rest of your life?

55
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:15,080
Yes.

56
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:16,081
Good.

57
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,127
That's my ambition.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,306
I don't want
to be a typist.

59
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,873
I don't want to be
some doctor's wife.

60
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,091
I understand that.

61
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:27,310
I don't want to
sit behind a desk,

62
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:28,746
and I don't want
to change diapers

63
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,531
until I shrivel up
and die.

64
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:32,489
Nobody saves the world,
Marita.

65
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,186
What are you doing?

66
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,884
I'm trying to protect
a country,

67
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:38,495
an idea that I believe in,
in whatever way I can.

68
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:40,105
Whether my actions
have any effect,

69
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:43,239
I don't really know,
but it's what I can do.

70
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,068
It's not very impressive
by your standards.

71
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:48,157
I didn't say that.

72
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,291
You're treating me
like I'm your enemy,
and I'm not.

73
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:54,337
You could get me
a job at the CIA.

74
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:57,645
Take the secretarial
course, and I'll see.

75
00:04:57,688 --> 00:04:59,473
We'd be spies together.

76
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:01,823
I'm not a spy.
I'm an analyst.

77
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,781
Truce?

78
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,435
Just tell me where
they're sending you.

79
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,872
You know I can't.

80
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:22,800
Why can't I?

81
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:24,976
Because I've told you so.

82
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,804
You let me go by
myself the last time.

83
00:05:26,848 --> 00:05:28,589
Now is different.

84
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:30,242
There's the captain.
Would you just ask him?

85
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:32,375
All right, I'm asking.

86
00:05:32,419 --> 00:05:34,377
Excuse me, Captain.

87
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:35,857
They aren't going
to get funny on us
down there, are they?

88
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,250
Of course not.
Havana is perfectly safe.

89
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:40,514
Sir, what about
the fighting?

90
00:05:40,557 --> 00:05:43,255
Dear lady, revolutions
in Latin America

91
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:45,388
are strictly
domestic affairs.

92
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,869
The new government
is in control,

93
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:49,871
and this Castro
will be as pleased
to see your money

94
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:52,961
as President Batista.
You have my word.

95
00:05:53,004 --> 00:05:54,223
Now, you have a
wonderful evening.

96
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:55,746
Thank you, sir.Enjoy yourselves.

97
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,878
See what 
I'm telling you?

98
00:05:56,921 --> 00:05:57,879
There's nothing wrong.

99
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:06,191
How can you be
so sure, Papa?

100
00:06:06,235 --> 00:06:07,541
What if he's different?

101
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:09,412
Shouldn't expect so much
of people, Marita.

102
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:10,848
You'll be less disappointed.

103
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:13,851
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.

104
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:16,811
I have to grow up
to be just like you.

105
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:20,292
You will stay on board.
Obey my wishes.

106

107
00:07:41,852 --> 00:07:43,463
Buenas noches, guapita.

108
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,639
Buenas noches.

109
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:47,118
¿Qué es esto?

110
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:49,512
Un recuerdo de  
la Revolución.

111
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:50,905
Me gusta.

112
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:52,123
¿Cuánto es?

113
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:55,170
Para ti, Florita, 
 two dollars.

114
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:00,349
Gracias. Muchas gracias.

115
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,194
Cuidado.

116
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:29,857
Sorry!

I am Dr. Castro.

120
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,404
I am Cuba.

121
00:08:55,447 --> 00:08:57,537
Where is the captain?

122
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,451
What do you
want with him?

123
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:03,238
We want to visit the ship.

124
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:05,283
Why?

125
00:09:05,327 --> 00:09:07,764
Why?

126
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:09,418
Why?

127
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:11,725
¿Cómo se dice?

128
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:14,205
Because, miss, Dr. Castro

129
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:18,166
has never been on
a ship so big before.

130
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:21,735
There's no need for you
to carry any weapons.

131
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:23,867
I speak with the captain.

132
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:25,739
My name is Marita Lorenz,

133
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:28,132
and I represent the
commander of this vessel.

134
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:31,396
And unless you
give up that rifle,

135
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,398
you're not
coming on board.

136
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:45,106
You have to take
that off, too.

137
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:50,198
Alemanita, 
 you want me desnudo?

138

So, in Alemania,the women
are in charge of the ships.

I'm not German.
I'm American.

143
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,836
You know the
Washington Senators?

144
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,272
The politicians?

145
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:23,710
The baseball team.
I was going to play for them.

146
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:26,147
I am the best pitcher.
It's true.

147
00:10:29,063 --> 00:10:32,457
You see them,
my young barbudos?

148
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:35,373
Never have they seen
such a thing in their life.

149
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:39,116
Where they are from,
there is no electricity,
no plumbing.

Some of them,
they no can even read.

151

When they are sick,
no medicine.

152

All of that,
I will change.

How?

154
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:53,435
I make the schools.
I make the hospitals.

155
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:57,439
I give them
the land to own,
first time 400 years.

156
00:10:57,482 --> 00:11:03,358
I make them say
be proud to be cubano.

157
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:08,755
Tell me, alemanita,
 what do you think?

158
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:12,672
I think it's important to
expect the best from people,

159
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:15,718
not to accept limitations.

160
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:18,199

And why you no say
you're a revolucionario?

166
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:34,694
What?

167
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:37,218
Con permiso.

00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,133
Oh, I got it last night.

169
00:11:39,176 --> 00:11:42,223
So, today,
you come join us.

172
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:47,750
What would I do?

173
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:49,143
What do we do?

174
00:11:49,186 --> 00:11:51,754

A sus órdenes.

Good day.

182
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,757
Captain, I need
someone very good

183
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,847
in English and
Spanish to help me,

184
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,198
so [speaks Spanish]
is clear

185
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:47,114
to the United States.

186
00:12:47,157 --> 00:12:49,203
I'm sure that's
a wise idea.

187
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:58,865
Your daughter,
she's very smart.

188
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:02,738
My daughter needs
to apply herself.

189
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,914
Apply?

190
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,657
Her abilities,
serve something in life.

191
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,834
Sí,because that
 is what I want,

192
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:14,010
for her to be
my secretary.

193
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:17,927
Dr. Castro,
she's 19 years old.

194
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:19,320
I will protect her.

195
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:22,192
She will have a guard
at all times.

196
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:23,541
It's a very
generous offer,

197
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:24,978
but neither her
mother or myself

198
00:13:25,021 --> 00:13:26,849
could permit
such a thing.

199
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,720
Please excuse me.
I have to go back
to the bridge.

200
00:13:28,764 --> 00:13:30,592
We sail in three hours.

201
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:31,811
I wish you
the best of luck.

202
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,725
Mucho gusto.

203
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,442
I've been ordered
to say good night.

204
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:58,359
[speaks Spanish]
We just meet.

205
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:00,752
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:03,364
I wanted to hear
more about what you're
going to do in Cuba.

207
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:07,716
Alemanita, 
I have so much ideas.

208
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,979
I cannot sleep
from thinking.

209
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:11,938
You will see.

210
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:15,463
Five years--
a new country.

211
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:21,121
The whole world
will look and say,
"Here is the future.

212
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:25,865
This is how good
a people can be."

213
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:27,431
I know this.

214
00:14:30,304 --> 00:14:31,566
I wish I could see it.

215
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,481
Of course, you can.

216
00:14:33,524 --> 00:14:37,572
I want to show you.

217
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:40,096
We haven't finished
the tour yet.

218
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,497
Do you smell it?

219
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,369
It floats right out
across the water.

220
00:14:52,413 --> 00:14:54,894
Galán de noche.

221
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:57,940
That is Cuba.

222
00:14:57,984 --> 00:15:01,509
In English, it's jasmine.

223
00:15:01,552 --> 00:15:03,946
More pretty in Spanish.

224
00:15:13,521 --> 00:15:15,827
You stay here.

225
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:16,959
I can't.

226
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:18,700
Yes.

227
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:21,137
You help me.

228
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:24,184
Dulce, mi cielo.

229
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:27,535
Dulce, querida.

230
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:29,580
You know these words.

231
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:50,514
Say you'll come back,  
prométeme.

232
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:59,088
Promise.

233
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:03,397
Because, alemanita,

234
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,095
this is where you belong.

235
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:17,411
Man:  
The next exercise

236
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:19,282
is designed to  
help you increase

237
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:22,155
both comprehension
 and speed.

238
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:24,287
Imagine your employer  
has called you in

239
00:16:24,331 --> 00:16:26,463
for dictation  
of the following letter.

240
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:29,292
[doorbell buzzing] Dear Mr. Harris...

241
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:39,650
Yeah?

242
00:16:39,694 --> 00:16:41,478
Hernando:  
Marita Lorenz?

243
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:43,045
Who's this?

244
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:46,048
I'm Hernando Figueroa,  
junior attaché

245
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:47,789
to the Embassy  
of the Republic of Cuba.

246
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,277
What did you say?

247
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,148
I'm Hernando Figueroa.

248
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:01,542
No, about Dr. Castro.

249
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:05,502
He-- you're to be
his secretary.

250
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:06,808
Who told you that?

251
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:09,463
Is this not correct?

252
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:11,508
No. Yes.

253
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:13,467
I mean, yes.
Yes, it's correct.

254
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,164
There's a government plane,

255
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,515
and we have a car waiting.

256
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,430
Please?Right now?

257
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:22,824
We will wait if
you need your bags.

258
00:17:22,867 --> 00:17:25,131
My parents.

259
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:26,523
I'm sorry, miss?

260
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,699
I should tell my parents.

261
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,093
They're not here.

262
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:32,573
They're never here.

263
00:17:32,616 --> 00:17:33,965
You are alone?

264
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,360
Yes.

265
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:44,759
From Dr. Castro.

266
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,645
Qué linda noche.

267
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,604
Sí.

268
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,867
I'll be right back.

269
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,227
[crowd shouting]

270
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:23,450
Why are they so angry?

271
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:25,147
They are the landlords,  
señorita,

272
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:29,064
and Fidel has cut
all rents by half.

273
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,066
They don't like it.

274
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,124
This is where he lives?

275
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,647
Sometimes.

276
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,913
[Spanish music playing]

277
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,226
Man: Mira, Raul!
Mira, mira!

278
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,227
That's what
I'm talking about!

279
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:47,055
Let Che handle the bank

280
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:48,839
and we'll be
in charge of reform!

281
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,406
Fidel: No quiero ser  
presidente de la reforma.

282
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,191
Man: We cannot keep
sitting on the fence!

283
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,018
We have to make a
decision internationally!

284
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:55,846
You keep pushing me
into this,

285
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,847
you know what they're going
to do in the United States?

286
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,632
What?

287
00:19:58,675 --> 00:19:59,894
They're going to send in
the ships and the marines!

288
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,334
Sí, sí, muy bien.  
Entra, entra.

289
00:20:05,378 --> 00:20:09,033
Señora, siéntese aquí,  
por favor.

290
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:11,253
All I'm saying
is that we do not

291
00:20:11,297 --> 00:20:13,473
have a political
structure in place!

292
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:16,127
The communists fought
with us in La Maestra.

293
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:17,564
Tienes razón, Raul.

294
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:20,784
We need an effective
method of organizing.

295
00:20:20,828 --> 00:20:22,264
You don't have
an opinion?

296
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:24,701
It's better to be
right than to win.

297
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:25,963
Sí.

298
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:27,574
What the hell
does that mean?

299
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:29,837
You know what is
bothering El Che?

300
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,709
He goes to
his pretty beach house
with his pretty mistress,

301
00:20:32,753 --> 00:20:34,668
but he cannot get
rid of his fat wife.

302
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:35,886
[laughing]

303
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,845
Es verdad, es verdad.

304
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:40,239
That doesn't change
the nature of revolution.

305
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,501
Oh.

306
00:20:41,544 --> 00:20:43,198
You know what
I'm going to do?

307
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,373
You're going to help
me finish this report.

308
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:47,376
No, no, no, no.
I'm going to--

309
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,117
I'm going to--

310
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,814
Juggle?

311
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:52,512
¿Ve? Ve?

312
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:54,470
See? Someone who
understands me.

313
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:55,906
Bueno, chicos.

314
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,430
Who wants to go
to the Tropicana?

315
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:59,301
Camilo's always good
for a party.

316
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,129
Yo voy.

317
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:04,045
Raul: We need less partying
and more work around here.

318
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:06,221
Juggle, juggle.

319
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,441
Pretty soon all
the balls are going to
come crashing down.

320
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:10,921
Marita, this is
my little brother Raul,

321
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:12,401
who is thinking
all the time.

322
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:13,576
Mucho gusto.

323
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,970
Encantada.

324
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:18,581
Tomorrow, a television
interview at 2:00.

325
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,496
We haven't met.

326
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,629
You cannot be late.

327
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:24,848
Then a meeting with
the landowners.

328
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:27,329
Oye,Celia, I have such
 a headache this morning.

329
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:28,635
What did you eat?

330
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:30,158
Nada.

331
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:32,987
Then what do you expect?
Eat something, chico.

332
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,431
Who's she?

333
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:45,260
Celia?
She's my secretary.

334
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:50,221
I thought I was
your secretary.

335
00:21:50,265 --> 00:21:51,440
You?

336
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:57,446
You are my angel...

337
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:05,280
...come down from heaven,

338
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:10,459
and now here you are
to save me.

339
00:23:45,946 --> 00:23:47,904
Hola, Marita.

340
00:23:47,948 --> 00:23:49,471
Marita: Hola.

341
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:51,560
Señora Sanchez,
where is...

342
00:23:51,604 --> 00:23:53,344
Fidel?

343
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:56,260
There's three answers
to that question.

344
00:23:56,304 --> 00:23:58,349
Where he should be,

345
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,874
where you think
he might be,

346
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,789
and where he is.

347
00:24:06,183 --> 00:24:07,924
Why do you come
to Havana?

348
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:14,017
Because I believe in
what he's trying to create.

349
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:15,279
And what is that?

350
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:21,895
A better life for
the Cuban people.

351
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:25,986
And you think the Cuban
people are waiting for

352
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:28,641
a little American girl
to help them?

353
00:24:28,684 --> 00:24:30,469
No, but I'd like to
try anyway.

354
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,476
Will you promise
me something?

355
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:42,132
What?

356
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:46,310
You and I, we have
to take care of him.

357
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:48,008
You've seen how he is.

358
00:24:48,051 --> 00:24:51,707
Can't even
match his socks.

359
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:56,669
So, will we be enemies
or will we help each other?

360
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:02,326
Help each other.

361
00:25:20,954 --> 00:25:23,957
¿Desayuno?  
Señorita,breakfast?

362
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,741
I would like a
glass of milk.

363
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:28,222
Glass of milk.

364
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:30,137
And a donut.
That one.

365
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,836
No, that one.You're room 2415?

366
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:37,492
How did you know that?

367
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,798
Dr. Castro, he tell me,

368
00:25:38,841 --> 00:25:42,671
"Epifano,
you take care of her."

369
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:44,325
Thanks.

370
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:16,139
American?

371
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:17,880
Yeah.

372
00:26:21,797 --> 00:26:24,495
Be careful about what
you get messed up in.

373
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:29,500
I don't appreciate
strangers--

374
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:34,941
If you get into trouble,
I can help you.

375
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,861
Help me?

376
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:44,559
How?

377
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,430
Remember what I said.

378
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:48,171
Your life may be
in danger.

379
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:00,531
Raul: Just tell me
I can go ahead.

380
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:03,143
I'll have every
casino in La Havana
shut down in a week.

381
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:05,232
We need the turistas.
 We need their money.

382
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:06,842
We need to send a message
to the yankees

383
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:07,930
that Cuba won't be
their whore anymore.

384
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:09,845
That's what we need!

385
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:11,630
Jesús, para.

386
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:22,205
Fidel!  
iQue viva Fidel!

387
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:24,338
Señora, ¿cómo estás?

388
00:27:25,513 --> 00:27:27,210
Are you listening to me?

389
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:30,474
Come, alemanita.

390
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:33,826
I'll show you
where I belong.

391
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:37,003
[applause]

392
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:40,049
iMuchachos!

393
00:27:41,921 --> 00:27:45,011
Who is winning?

394
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:46,795
Let us see
what you have.

395
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:50,059
iMuy bien!

396
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,500
Dámelo.

397
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,372
A ver, ¿eh?

398
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:06,032
[cheering]

399
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:15,606
We're late, we're late.
Come on.

400
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,956
Let's go.

401
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:21,743
Señor! Señor!

402
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:23,658
Please, señor.

403
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,268
My son is in jail.

404
00:28:25,312 --> 00:28:26,922
They won't let me
see him!

405
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:28,619
They won't tell me
what he has done!

406
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:29,795
Mamita, lo siento.

407
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:31,579
Señor!

408
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:33,233
I have faith in you!

409
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:35,017
He's only a student!

410
00:28:35,061 --> 00:28:37,411
Señor!
I have faith in you!

411
00:28:37,454 --> 00:28:41,067
I have faith in you!
I have faith in you!

412
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,198
No!

413
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:45,549
iSeñores y señoras!

414
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:47,769
Miente.

415
00:28:47,813 --> 00:28:52,426
Why do we fight
against corruption?

416
00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:54,602
Against imperialism?

417
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:58,606
Against the rich
feeding off the poor?

418
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:01,522
Who were our enemies?

419
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:03,002
The landowners!

420
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:06,788
The military,
the capitalists!

421
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:09,051
The American President!

422
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:12,402
[crowd booing]

423
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:17,538
Not everyone has Cuba
in his heart!

424
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:20,019
What is the revolution?

425
00:29:20,062 --> 00:29:22,108
A uniform?

426
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:23,587
A flag?

427
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:26,416
The revolution
is a living thing,

428
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,333
but only as long as
we believe in it!

429
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:33,249
iViva Cuba libre!

430
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:36,426
Libre, libre, libre!

431
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,777
[chanting continues]

432
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:47,133
Don't you sleep?

433
00:29:47,176 --> 00:29:50,658
When everything is fixed,
then I will sleep.

434
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:08,110
That woman's son,

435
00:30:08,154 --> 00:30:11,461
how do you know
he's not innocent?

436
00:30:11,505 --> 00:30:13,812
I don't even know
who he is.

437
00:30:18,294 --> 00:30:20,340
Doesn't that
bother you?

438
00:30:25,954 --> 00:30:28,435
I was in prison.

439
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:31,307
Batista put me there.

440
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:33,570
He is now a millionaire
in Santo Domingo

441
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:36,573
with the money he stole,

442
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:41,927
and the ones who kept him
in power are still here--

443
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:46,627
policemen, soldiers,
doctors, students.

444
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,673
They all have mothers.

445
00:30:49,717 --> 00:30:51,762
Does that make
them innocent?

446
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:55,897
What happens to them?

447
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:03,339
You don't know Cuba,  
alemanita.

448
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:06,995
Here, you have
to be strong.

449
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:31,933
How are our friends
in Tripoli?

450
00:31:31,977 --> 00:31:34,936
You're not usually waiting
on the runway for
my report, Harold.

451
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,068
You know Stewart Allen?

452
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:37,852
No.Stewart is FBI.

453
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,723
Special Operations,
interagency liaison.

454
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,682
He has something
to ask you.

455
00:31:41,725 --> 00:31:44,337
Do you know where your
daughter is, Mrs. Lorenz?

456
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,729
Did something
happen to her?

457
00:31:45,773 --> 00:31:48,297
I'm just asking
where your daughter is.

458
00:31:48,341 --> 00:31:51,692
She's in New York
at school.

459
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:54,173
And if she's not there?

460
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:55,348
Why don't you just
tell me what this is--

461
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:58,264
Answer him, Alice.

462
00:31:58,307 --> 00:32:01,310
She's with her father
at sea.

463
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:04,966
I'd like you to look
at something, please.

464
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,838
These were taken two
weeks ago in Havana.

465
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:09,492
Recognize anyone
in the photos?

466
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,280
This is Fidel Castro.

467
00:32:18,153 --> 00:32:20,329
This is my daughter.

468
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:23,158
Were you aware that she had
an association with Castro?

469
00:32:25,508 --> 00:32:27,423
Mrs. Lorenz, any prior
association with him?

470
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,208
No!

471
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,472
Would you describe your
daughter's political beliefs?

472
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:35,127
Harold.

473
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,171
Her political beliefs?

474
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:37,607
She doesn't have any.

475
00:32:37,651 --> 00:32:38,826
You're sure.Of course, I'm sure.

476
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:40,175
She's my daughter.

477
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:41,698
With all due respect,
Mrs. Lorenz,

478
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:44,179
you're not aware
which country she's in.

479
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:46,399
Would it be safe to say
you don't know what
her convictions are?

480
00:32:58,454 --> 00:33:00,108
Got the night off?

481
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:04,852
Why are you
following me?

482
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:06,419
You should talk to
your mother.

483
00:33:06,462 --> 00:33:09,291
She's trying to reach you.
She's worried.

484
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:11,859
How do you know
my mother?

485
00:33:11,902 --> 00:33:14,383
We have the same boss.

486
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,342
You work for the CIA?

487
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:19,127
Let's say I'm a patriot.

488
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:21,564
Then why are you
wearing that uniform?

489
00:33:21,608 --> 00:33:24,393
Why are you?

490
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:27,440
You could help
your country, you know.

491
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:32,227
This is my country.

492
00:33:32,271 --> 00:33:37,450
Little girl, you're up
there alone five nights
out of the week.

493
00:33:37,493 --> 00:33:40,018
What do you think
he's doing?

494
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:42,324
Folding laundry?

495
00:33:44,892 --> 00:33:46,589
Don't take it personal.

496
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:50,767
Get yourself
on the right side.

497
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:59,298
I am saying  
how many time,

498
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:02,083
as soon as  
we can guarantee  
a stable transition,

499
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:04,781
there will be election.

500
00:34:04,825 --> 00:34:07,697
As soon as we  
can guarantee it.

501
00:34:07,741 --> 00:34:10,265
I have accepted  
an invitation

502
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:13,225
from the American Society  
of Newspaper Editors...

503
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:16,663
Buenas noches. Buenas noches.

504
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:19,274
Fidel: I will meet  
with Eisenhower,

505
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:22,843
and we will  
discuss economic...

506
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:40,513
Man: What are you doing
in my house?

507
00:34:40,556 --> 00:34:43,124
What?
Get out of my house!

508
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:44,125
[man grunting]

509
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:47,824
Ay, Dios mío.

510
00:34:47,868 --> 00:34:49,696
A school teacher.Yes!

511
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:57,660
Man:
You're going to
the wall!

512
00:34:57,704 --> 00:34:59,053
You're a dead man.

513
00:35:00,489 --> 00:35:02,491
Desgraciado.Get in there!

514
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:10,543
[door closes]

515
00:35:16,462 --> 00:35:20,292
Alemanita, 
come see what I made.

516
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:22,120
Butter sauce, spaghetti--

517
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:24,600
it's all you need.
Have some.

518
00:35:27,734 --> 00:35:30,824
I just saw a man taken
from his home and beaten.

519
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,133
Come eat something.

520
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:37,439
Are there executions?

521
00:35:40,703 --> 00:35:43,184
And what would you
do to your enemies?

522
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:47,145
I wouldn't kill them.

523
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:51,279
Batista murdered thousands.

524
00:35:51,323 --> 00:35:55,153
No trials,
no witnesses.

525
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:57,894
You said you were going
to make this a new country.

526
00:35:57,938 --> 00:35:59,940
And how will I do that
if they kill me?

527
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:02,899
Because they are
trying to every day.

528
00:36:02,943 --> 00:36:06,076
Show them
there's another way.

529
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,601
There is what you want,  
alemanita,

530
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:13,301
and there is what
you have to do.

531
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:15,912
Why aren't they
the same thing?

532
00:36:15,956 --> 00:36:17,523
Do you think history
will care?

533
00:36:17,566 --> 00:36:18,828
Do you think it
will even notice?

534
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:21,222
I'm not talking
about history.

535
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:22,963
I'm talking about
what's right.

536
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:25,879
What I leave behind
is what matters.

537
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:30,362
Not how, but what.

538
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:34,017
My enemies are
the enemies of Cuba!

539
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:37,238
And when they attack me
with their words,

540
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:38,239
with their actions...

541
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:39,849
[knocking on door]

542
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:42,025
It's too late!
I made myself something!

543
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:50,512
It's all right,  
alemanita.

544
00:36:50,556 --> 00:36:52,862
You will see.

545
00:36:52,906 --> 00:36:57,171
I will make everything
all right.

546
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:06,354
[crowd shouting]

547
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:19,541
I come to Washington
as a tourist.

548
00:37:21,804 --> 00:37:24,894
I look forward to meeting
with Eisenhower

549
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:29,290
because I bring him 
good Cuba rum,

550
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:33,860
and to say we want
new relation with
the United States.

551
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:51,878
I tried to write.
I didn't...

552
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,230
Here I am.

553
00:38:01,931 --> 00:38:05,413
Your friend is meeting
the Vice President right now.

554
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:08,416
Why aren't you
with him?

555
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,940
I wanted to
see you instead.

556
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:17,033
What is it that you
think you're doing?

557
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:18,774
Helping the revolution.

558
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:21,342
It's not yours
to help.

559
00:38:21,386 --> 00:38:22,909
What's that supposed
to mean?

560
00:38:22,952 --> 00:38:24,998
You have an allegiance
to the United States.

561
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:29,785
It's not something
that you can just
decide to throw away.

562
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:32,092
However charming you
might find Castro,

563
00:38:32,135 --> 00:38:35,356
he is not the savior
of the Cuban people.

564
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,054
You know nothing
about him.

565
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:39,273
You don't know what
he's trying to achieve

566
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,492
or what he has
to fight against.

567
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:42,537
Castro is a communist.

568
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:46,236
His revolution has
a communist agenda.

569
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,588
He's trying to free
Cuba from hundreds
of years of injustice.

570
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:51,546
Is that why he has
executions without trials?

571
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,548
Why he arrests journalists
in his country who
criticize him?

572
00:38:53,592 --> 00:38:56,290
Why he refuses
to hold elections?

573
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,987
He's doing
what he has to do.

574
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:00,555
Is that what he's
convinced you of?

575
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:06,474
Why did you call me?

576
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,615
I wanted to let you know
that I was all right.

577
00:39:22,011 --> 00:39:26,189
I'm just trying
to protect you from
something that you don't--

578
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:28,409
you don't seem to
understand is going
to affect you

579
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:31,194
for the rest of your
life, not to mention
your entire family.

580
00:39:31,238 --> 00:39:34,981
Family? You and Papa
don't even live together!

581
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:36,765
I don't want to discuss
the arrangements that
your father and I--

582
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:40,639
What do you want
to discuss, Mama?

583
00:39:40,682 --> 00:39:43,293
I have made a decision,
and you can't accept it!

584
00:39:43,337 --> 00:39:45,165
Is that what you
want to tell me?

585
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,732
That I don't
understand you?
Well, I don't.

586
00:39:46,775 --> 00:39:47,907
I don't understand you.

587
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,126
I'm not asking you to!

588
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:03,749
I can't listen
to this now!

589
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:05,272
We told you this
before you went away!

590
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:07,056
iPrepárarte!

591
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,145
You're right. Fine.
Nixon treated me
like a child.

592
00:40:09,189 --> 00:40:10,930
I said we needed money.

593
00:40:10,973 --> 00:40:13,411
They treated me like a
child begging for a sweet!

594
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:16,544
And the both of you,
the second I get back,
like two old women.

595
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:18,546
So no one can say
anything to you now,
is that it?

596
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,592
They won't put a penny
into Cuba--

597
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:22,158
What did you expect?

598
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:24,422
You tell the Americans
whatever they want to hear,

599
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:26,859
and then they give you
absolutely nothing, nada!

600
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:28,034
Don't be an idiot.

601
00:40:28,077 --> 00:40:30,253
Did you say a word
about socialism?

602
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:31,994
About real change?

603
00:40:32,038 --> 00:40:33,605
You bark like
a performing dog!

604
00:40:33,648 --> 00:40:35,041
And you sit
on your ass!

605
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:36,651
I'm bored.
The revolution is over.

606
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:38,305
I can't get away
from my wife.

607
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:40,350
You don't have a stomach
for the real fight.

608
00:40:40,394 --> 00:40:42,440
Maybe what you've forgotten
what the real fight is.

609
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,052
Fidel?Yes?

610
00:40:46,095 --> 00:40:47,836
I need to talk to you. Sí,later.

611
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,490
When?

612
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:50,883
I don't know,  
más tarde.

613
00:40:57,237 --> 00:40:59,500
Che, you know I trust you.

614
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:01,763
We fought side by side.
You're like my brother.

615
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:04,592
Che: Fidel, you forgot!
You forgot what
we talked about!

616
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:07,900
Raul:
You got to their territory,
you're in their home--

617
00:41:07,943 --> 00:41:10,032
They do what
they want with you.

618
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:17,213
Hermanito,
 let's face it.

619
00:41:17,257 --> 00:41:20,042
the United States is
never going to help us.

620
00:41:20,086 --> 00:41:22,610
They'd rather see us dead.

621
00:41:22,654 --> 00:41:28,094
All they care
about is keeping their
damn casinos open.

622
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:31,750
We have to think of
other possibilities.

623
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:33,534
The Soviet Union.

624
00:41:33,578 --> 00:41:35,754
What choice do we have?

625
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:39,497
[Spanish music playing]

626
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:47,113
[speaks Spanish]

627
00:41:48,593 --> 00:41:49,855
[music stops]

628
00:41:57,993 --> 00:41:59,212
What is it?

629
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:03,477
I'm pregnant.

630
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,308
Is it mine?

631
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:11,224
Yes, it's yours.

632
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,923
Do you want to go home?

633
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:16,577
I thought you said
this was my home.

634
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:20,842
It is.
Of course, it is, but...

635
00:42:20,886 --> 00:42:23,366
What?

636
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,369
You don't have time
for your secretary now?

637
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:28,589
Would it be more convenient
for you in between meetings

638
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:33,246
with Graciella and
Natalia and Teresa?

639
00:42:33,289 --> 00:42:34,421
Alemanita...

640
00:42:34,464 --> 00:42:36,336
Get out.

641
00:42:36,379 --> 00:42:37,816
Get out.

642
00:43:08,063 --> 00:43:09,412
Desembarque.

643
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:11,327
Enseguida, capitán.  
iVamos! iVamos!

644
00:43:11,371 --> 00:43:13,982
Trust me. Now they'll
know we're serious.

645
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:20,119
You read this.

646
00:43:27,387 --> 00:43:30,042
I thought you
weren't going to do
this to the tourists.

647
00:43:31,217 --> 00:43:33,349
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa.

648
00:43:33,393 --> 00:43:35,613
Hey, whoa, whoa.

649
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:37,179
What's going on here?

650
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:44,056
By the order of the
Republic of Cuba

651
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:49,148
and in respect of
the rights and freedoms
of the Cuban people,

652
00:43:49,191 --> 00:43:51,803
this casino is now closed.

653
00:43:51,846 --> 00:43:53,239
Can we talk about this?

654
00:43:53,282 --> 00:43:55,894
Your hotel can stay open.

655
00:43:55,937 --> 00:43:58,853
All of your equipment
will be stored,

656
00:43:58,897 --> 00:44:01,682
and you will be
given a receipt.

657
00:44:01,726 --> 00:44:06,295
But as of today, there is
no more gambling in Cuba.

658
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:09,821
Says who?Cuba says.

659
00:44:09,864 --> 00:44:11,953
I think you're making
a big mistake here.

660
00:44:11,997 --> 00:44:14,869
This casino is owned
by Mr. Charles Luciano.

661
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:17,959
What is he? Italian?

662
00:44:18,003 --> 00:44:21,354
He's an American citizen
with a major interest in Cuba.

663
00:44:21,397 --> 00:44:24,923
I suggest that
you rethink what--

664
00:44:24,966 --> 00:44:26,228
what the hell
is he doing?

665
00:44:26,272 --> 00:44:28,535
Juggling.

666
00:44:49,861 --> 00:44:53,647
[knocking on door]

667
00:44:59,479 --> 00:45:01,307
Hola, Marita. Hola.

668
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:34,514
All the juggling is...
very hard.

669
00:45:36,951 --> 00:45:38,692
Then stop.

670
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:43,784
If I stop,
the Americanos

671
00:45:43,828 --> 00:45:46,613
will send Batista back
in a helicopter,

672
00:45:46,656 --> 00:45:50,573
and to the wall
with Fidel, huh?

673
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,579
Will you miss me,  
alemanita?

674
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:02,716
You haven't
treated me right.

675
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:07,590
From the moment
I saw you,

676
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:09,984
I could not help myself.

677
00:46:13,031 --> 00:46:15,294
It's all your fault.

678
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:33,878
[knocking on door]

679
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:35,314
Hola. Buenas noches.

680
00:46:35,357 --> 00:46:36,663
Where's Epifano?

681
00:46:36,706 --> 00:46:38,621
He's sick today.

682
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:40,449
I hope it's not serious.

683
00:46:40,493 --> 00:46:43,496
Well, miss,
God provides.

684
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:45,367
Gracias. Gracias.

685
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,698
Where am I?

686
00:47:55,742 --> 00:47:59,311
You're in New York.
Roosevelt Hospital.

687
00:48:01,052 --> 00:48:02,401
A call came from
the Cuban Embassy.

688
00:48:02,444 --> 00:48:07,275
They put you on
a plane last night.

689
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:09,495
They said you were sick.

690
00:48:11,497 --> 00:48:12,933
Sick?

691
00:48:12,977 --> 00:48:14,935
Septicemia.

692
00:48:14,979 --> 00:48:17,068
You lost a lot of blood
from what they did to you.

693
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:29,341
Where's my baby, Mama?

694
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,085
Marita...

695
00:48:39,742 --> 00:48:42,310
Marita, my name
is Stewart Allen.

696
00:48:42,354 --> 00:48:45,835
This is Agent Olshan,
Agent Larrigoy,

697
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:49,230
Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

698
00:48:49,274 --> 00:48:51,145
I just wanted to come by
and introduce myself

699
00:48:51,189 --> 00:48:54,975
and let you know
that we're here to
protect you now,

700
00:48:55,019 --> 00:49:00,633
and also how sorry I am.

701
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:08,423
I want to see my baby.

702
00:49:11,296 --> 00:49:14,734
Marita,
some people have done--

703
00:49:14,777 --> 00:49:18,781
have been ordered to do
something terrible to you.

704
00:49:18,825 --> 00:49:20,000
don't know how much
of this you remember--

705
00:49:20,044 --> 00:49:22,394
none of it, I hope,
for your sake.

706
00:49:22,437 --> 00:49:27,007
You were given an abortion
and left for dead.

707
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:29,314
Your baby didn't survive...

708
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,625
...by order of Fidel Castro.

709
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:38,018
I'm sorry.

710
00:49:38,062 --> 00:49:40,325
How do you know
the baby didn't survive?

711
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:43,981
There's evidence.

712
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:45,591
What evidence?

713
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:47,680
I'm sorry.
There's very clear evidence.

714
00:49:47,723 --> 00:49:50,074
You need to rest.Tell me!

715
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:53,599
Believe me.Show me!

716
00:49:53,642 --> 00:49:57,646
You hate Fidel!

717
00:49:57,690 --> 00:49:59,953
You hate me!

718
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:01,694
Darling, I love you.

719
00:50:01,737 --> 00:50:04,175
You all need to leave now.
She has to rest.

720
00:50:09,528 --> 00:50:10,790
Mama!

721
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:11,878
I'm sorry.
You have to go.

722
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:15,360
She has to have her rest.

723
00:50:15,403 --> 00:50:16,361
Okay. Calm down, miss.

724
00:50:26,762 --> 00:50:28,373
Are you okay?

725
00:50:39,645 --> 00:50:43,083
My clearance
has been revoked.

726
00:50:43,127 --> 00:50:44,998
I had nothing
to do with that.

727
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:48,697
Either I'm running
my own covert operation

728
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:50,308
against Castro
using my daughter,

729
00:50:50,351 --> 00:50:54,573
or I was leaking
information to
him through her.

730
00:50:54,616 --> 00:50:57,619
It's perfectly logical, isn't
it?

731
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:02,842
Well, you were OSS
during the war, weren't you?

732
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:06,280
Yes.

733
00:51:06,324 --> 00:51:09,849
American spy,
living under the Reich,
German husband,

734
00:51:09,892 --> 00:51:13,026
had a baby girl in
the middle of all that.

735
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,463
That's a lot of
different loyalties.

736
00:51:15,507 --> 00:51:18,292
I chose the one
that mattered to me.

737
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:23,471
Yes, and you're going to
have to choose now,
Mrs. Lorenz.

738
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:26,648
I won't sacrifice my child
to prove what I believe in.

739
00:51:26,692 --> 00:51:29,347
You're not
sacrificing her.

740
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:32,524
You're saving her.

741
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:36,049
Look, why don't you get back
to Washington, D.C.?

742
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,052
Your being here is just
going to make it harder,

743
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:42,447
and we'll be in touch.

744
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:46,146
And if it wouldn't
offend you,

745
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,279
I'd like to put this
over her bed.

746
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:10,431
Marita.

747
00:52:10,475 --> 00:52:11,824
Let me get you a sandwich
or something, okay?

748
00:52:11,867 --> 00:52:13,826
Get your strength
back for you.

749
00:52:15,219 --> 00:52:16,959
How long do I have
to stay here?

750
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:20,789
Well, it is your house so
you can do whatever you like.

751
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:22,704
We're just here to make
sure things are all right.

752
00:52:26,926 --> 00:52:31,452
I made you a little
sandwich here, Marita.

753
00:52:31,496 --> 00:52:34,368
Some potato chips.

754
00:52:34,412 --> 00:52:36,588
Eat that,
you'll feel better.

755
00:52:40,896 --> 00:52:45,205
I want to go home.To Cuba?

756
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:47,207
I don't know why
you'd want to go back there.

757
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:49,601
You're American.

758
00:52:49,644 --> 00:52:52,169
It's great seeing
other parts--

759
00:53:01,047 --> 00:53:02,918
What if I walked away?

760
00:53:02,962 --> 00:53:04,311
Couldn't stop you.

761
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:06,226
Might be worried about
your safety, though.

762
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:08,402
A lot of Cubans
in New York.

763
00:53:08,446 --> 00:53:10,926
Let me help you.Where are my parents?

764
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:13,625
Uh, your father, I believe,
is aboard The Berlin.

765
00:53:13,668 --> 00:53:15,409
Next port of call
is Rio de Janeiro.

766
00:53:15,453 --> 00:53:18,064
Your mother is in
Washington, D.C.

767
00:53:18,107 --> 00:53:20,240
She's very upset
with you by the way.

768
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:22,851
You said some
pretty harsh things.

769
00:53:22,895 --> 00:53:26,290
You feeling a little
sorry about that now?

770
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,250
Why would I tell you?

771
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:32,078
No reason.

772
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:35,473
I just hate to see
a family tearing itself
apart like that.

773
00:53:35,516 --> 00:53:38,998
You know, maybe I protect
my own children too much.

774
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:41,392
But then, I look at what's
happening in the world,

775
00:53:41,435 --> 00:53:43,220
and it makes me frightened,

776
00:53:43,263 --> 00:53:47,093
and I just have to
fight that much harder.

777
00:53:47,136 --> 00:53:48,660
Fight what?

778
00:53:48,703 --> 00:53:52,098
Let me ask you something.
What do you believe in?

779
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:53,752
I don't know anymore.

780
00:53:53,795 --> 00:53:56,450
See, that's the most dangerous
situation you can be in,

781
00:53:56,494 --> 00:53:58,670
because then anyone with
a big enough personality

782
00:53:58,713 --> 00:54:01,281
can walk right into
your life and take it over.

783
00:54:01,325 --> 00:54:03,675
Is that really
what you want?

784
00:54:03,718 --> 00:54:05,285
What do you believe in?

785
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:06,591
That's a good question.

786
00:54:06,634 --> 00:54:08,288
For a long time,

787
00:54:08,332 --> 00:54:10,769
I felt like
there was no place
in the world for me.

788
00:54:10,812 --> 00:54:12,771
In fact,
that's something--

789
00:54:12,814 --> 00:54:14,599
something I think
I see in you.

790
00:54:16,862 --> 00:54:18,298
You don't feel
like that now?

791
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:20,126
No.

792
00:54:20,169 --> 00:54:22,868
No, because I came
to realize something
I denied for a long time,

793
00:54:22,911 --> 00:54:28,308
and that is that God is real
and present in the world,

794
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:32,834
that he has plans for me.

795
00:54:32,878 --> 00:54:36,011
He wants me in
this world as a warrior.

796
00:54:36,055 --> 00:54:37,578
Want some?

797
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,278
You sure?

798
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:43,062
You're fighting for God?

799
00:54:43,105 --> 00:54:45,847
Sort of.
I'm fighting for the values
of the United States,

800
00:54:45,891 --> 00:54:48,328
and I know in my heart--
just a second--

801
00:54:48,372 --> 00:54:50,504
that communism
wherever it appears

802
00:54:50,548 --> 00:54:52,506
is utterly opposed
to those values,

803
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:54,073
and, Marita, that's evil.

804
00:54:57,206 --> 00:54:59,165
Fidel isn't evil.

805
00:54:59,208 --> 00:55:00,514
Well, what do you
call someone

806
00:55:00,558 --> 00:55:02,690
who would kill
his own unborn child?

807
00:55:02,734 --> 00:55:04,518
He didn't do that.

808
00:55:04,562 --> 00:55:06,738
Listen, Marita,
whether it was to keep it
from his mistresses--

809
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:08,348
and we know that
there are at least
three others--

810
00:55:08,392 --> 00:55:09,741
or because
the political fallout

811
00:55:09,784 --> 00:55:12,352
in his own country
here was too great,

812
00:55:12,396 --> 00:55:15,529
he behaved like the gangster
and the coward that he is!

813
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:17,401
I can't hear you.You know what?

814
00:55:17,444 --> 00:55:19,141
Your mother didn't
want you to see these.

815
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:20,578
But you asked for proof?I can't hear you!

816
00:55:20,621 --> 00:55:21,622
You said you
wanted proof?

817
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:23,189
All right, look at this.

818
00:55:23,232 --> 00:55:25,365
Your baby
was born alive!

819
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:26,497
Oh, my God!

820
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,368
He was a boy!

821
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:29,761
They killed him
in the room.

822
00:55:29,804 --> 00:55:31,066
Marita, look at this.

823
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:32,764
This is what
the devil can do!

824
00:55:32,807 --> 00:55:35,157
Look at it!
That's your baby!

825
00:55:35,201 --> 00:55:36,463
Look at that!I can't hear you!

826
00:55:36,507 --> 00:55:39,684
Look at it! Marita!

827
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:43,209
Hold it! Hold it!

828
00:55:43,252 --> 00:55:45,777
Man:
Are you crazy?

829
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,387
You're all right.
Come here.

830
00:55:47,431 --> 00:55:48,780
You're going to be
all right.

831
00:55:48,823 --> 00:55:51,783
You're going to be
all right.

832
00:55:51,826 --> 00:55:52,697
We're going to
take care of you.

833
00:56:55,107 --> 00:56:57,065
Collect call.

834
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:59,633
International.

835
00:56:59,677 --> 00:57:01,548
The Havana Hilton.

836
00:57:06,205 --> 00:57:08,381
[gunshots]

837
00:57:10,339 --> 00:57:12,559
Where is she?Over there!

838
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,609
Marita, get down!

839
00:57:18,652 --> 00:57:20,306
Stay down!

840
00:57:21,873 --> 00:57:24,353
Get up!
Come on!

841
00:57:24,397 --> 00:57:26,051
Go!

842
00:57:30,969 --> 00:57:33,406
Marita, what were
you trying to do?

843
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,147
I wanted to
talk to Fidel.

844
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:37,628
Don't you think he
was counting on that?

845
00:57:37,671 --> 00:57:41,022
Don't you realize
that he's just

846
00:57:41,066 --> 00:57:43,677
waiting for a chance
to finish what he started?

847
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:45,679
What do you mean?

848
00:57:45,723 --> 00:57:48,334
Marita, as long
as you're alive,

849
00:57:48,377 --> 00:57:50,336
you can prove that
he's not who he says he is.

850
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:52,904
He's not a savior.

851
00:57:52,947 --> 00:57:54,514
He's not a man
of the people.

852
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:59,693
Fidel Castro is a liar,
an adulterer,

853
00:57:59,737 --> 00:58:01,303
and a murderer
many times over,

854
00:58:01,347 --> 00:58:02,522
and it's time you
realize that,

855
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:05,133
because the next
opportunity they get,

856
00:58:05,177 --> 00:58:09,616
I guarantee you,
they will not miss.

857
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,532
I don't care.

858
00:58:12,576 --> 00:58:15,448
What are you saying?

859
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:19,408
Are you telling me
that you don't care
about your life?

860
00:58:19,452 --> 00:58:20,627
No.

861
00:58:22,542 --> 00:58:26,024
I'm being punished.

862
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:28,853
Isn't that what God
does to sinners?

863
00:58:28,896 --> 00:58:32,857
Okay, but what if you
could redeem yourself?

864
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,381
What if you
could do something

865
00:58:35,424 --> 00:58:39,254
that was really meaningful
for your country,

866
00:58:39,298 --> 00:58:41,213
and for your soul,

867
00:58:41,256 --> 00:58:42,519
and for the soul
of your baby?

868
00:58:42,562 --> 00:58:46,174
Would you do that?

869
00:58:46,218 --> 00:58:47,480
What?

870
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:52,137
Do you remember what I said?

871
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:56,228
That God sometimes chooses
someone to be a warrior?

872
00:58:58,273 --> 00:58:59,971
All right,
you'll be trained,

873
00:59:00,014 --> 00:59:02,060
and when the time is right,

874
00:59:02,103 --> 00:59:03,975
you will go back to Havana,

875
00:59:04,018 --> 00:59:06,804
and you will make
sure he never,

876
00:59:06,847 --> 00:59:08,414
ever hurts anyone again.

877
00:59:10,764 --> 00:59:12,157
You want me to kill him?

878
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,725
Marita, he's trying
to kill you.

879
00:59:14,768 --> 00:59:16,596
He's already
killed a part of you.

880
00:59:19,164 --> 00:59:20,818
I can't do that.

881
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:22,471
Yes, you can.

882
00:59:22,515 --> 00:59:24,822
The thought is worse
than the action.

883
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:26,606
The thought
holds you back.

884
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:29,000
But the action, Marita,

885
00:59:29,043 --> 00:59:31,524
the action will
set you free.

886
00:59:36,964 --> 00:59:38,966
Marita...

887
00:59:40,838 --> 00:59:43,623
...it's exactly
what he deserves.

888
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:46,321
The choice is yours.
It's your choice,

889
00:59:46,365 --> 00:59:48,976
but it's also
your responsibility.

890
00:59:51,065 --> 00:59:53,067
What about God?

891
00:59:53,111 --> 00:59:57,550
Marita, we don't do what
we want in this world.

892
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,509
We do what we have to,
and God understands that.

893
01:00:02,816 --> 01:00:04,905
And he forgives us.

894
01:00:04,949 --> 01:00:07,212
And God will forgive you.

895
01:00:15,742 --> 01:00:18,005
Where's my mother?

896
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:19,877
You want to speak
to your mother?

897
01:00:21,879 --> 01:00:24,664
Okay. All right.
We can do that.

898
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:36,676
I wanted to apologize
for what I said.

899
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,592
I was angry,

900
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:44,205
and I really didn't know
who I was angry at.

901
01:00:44,249 --> 01:00:46,338
We don't have to
talk about it.

902
01:00:48,557 --> 01:00:50,777
They want me to...

903
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:54,781
I know what they want.

904
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:01,135
Do you know why
we bought this house?

905
01:01:01,179 --> 01:01:05,487
The war changed things
between your father
and me for the worse.

906
01:01:05,531 --> 01:01:07,576
You were the only thing
left we had in common.

907
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:11,450
And I devoted myself
to a cause,

908
01:01:11,493 --> 01:01:14,496
and I don't apologize
for that,

909
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,107
but I think...

910
01:01:18,979 --> 01:01:21,503
I know that I failed you.
I know that.

911
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:29,294
But I wanted there
to be someplace that
you felt was home.

912
01:01:29,337 --> 01:01:31,731
Well, there isn't.

913
01:01:36,431 --> 01:01:39,086
Well, then, you have to--

914
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:41,741
you have to make
one for yourself

915
01:01:41,785 --> 01:01:44,222
by the actions
that you take.

916
01:01:44,265 --> 01:01:46,050
Do you understand,
darling?

917
01:01:49,531 --> 01:01:55,059
What you choose now
is what you will be.

918
01:02:04,982 --> 01:02:07,288
You think I should
do it, Mama?

919
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:15,166
You have to find the courage

920
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:18,517
to do what's necessary

921
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,041
no matter how wrong
it may seem.

922
01:02:32,313 --> 01:02:34,663
That's heroism.

923
01:02:49,983 --> 01:02:52,159
You tell them
I was loyal.

924
01:03:04,693 --> 01:03:06,826
Who's this man?Mickey Evans.

925
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:08,175
A great interest
in all things Cuban,

926
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:10,351
and very interested
in meeting you.

927
01:03:10,395 --> 01:03:12,049
Mickey.

928
01:03:12,092 --> 01:03:13,833
Old Father Stewart.

929
01:03:13,877 --> 01:03:15,226
How's God?
Still in business?

930
01:03:15,269 --> 01:03:16,923
You bet.

931
01:03:16,967 --> 01:03:18,838
I didn't know the museum
kept night hours.

932
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:20,927
Well, I got
a thing about crowds.

933
01:03:20,971 --> 01:03:23,060
You know the major here,
one of the good guys?

934
01:03:23,103 --> 01:03:24,278
Yeah.
We met in Miami.

935
01:03:24,322 --> 01:03:25,236
Placer.

936
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:27,673
This is her?

937
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:33,026
Marita Lorenz.

938
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:35,202
Mucho gusto.

939
01:03:35,246 --> 01:03:36,856
Mickey: 
Just let me say this.

940
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:39,206
When I heard what that
red bastard did to you,

941
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,600
I wanted to kill him myself,
and I mean that.

942
01:03:44,733 --> 01:03:46,126
Charlie Baron says hello.

943
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:48,868
Who?

944
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:49,869
He runs the Rivera
down there.

945
01:03:49,913 --> 01:03:51,131
Said he ran into you.

946
01:03:51,175 --> 01:03:52,524
Are you in the
casino business?

947
01:03:52,567 --> 01:03:53,786
No. I'm in the
friendship business.

948
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,701
I bring people together.

949
01:03:55,744 --> 01:03:57,224
People ought
to know each other,
patriotic people.

950
01:03:57,268 --> 01:03:59,357
Sam Giancana, Stewart Allen,

951
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,577
the Major,
Dwight Eisenhower,
people like that.

952
01:04:02,621 --> 01:04:06,320
Senorita Lorenz,
are you going to kill him?

953
01:04:06,364 --> 01:04:08,801
Major, can we keep
the discussion on
a more general basis?

954
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:12,022
I told you it was
a waste of time.

955
01:04:12,065 --> 01:04:14,720
You should have
listened to me,
little girl.

956
01:04:14,763 --> 01:04:16,461
Could have wrote it
all down in your diary

957
01:04:16,504 --> 01:04:20,030
and married a nice
dentist somewhere.

958
01:04:20,073 --> 01:04:22,206
But you had
a better idea--

959
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:23,860
I'll just be a traitor
and a whore.

960
01:04:26,297 --> 01:04:27,341
Keep it friendly,
Mr. Sturgis.

961
01:04:27,385 --> 01:04:29,213
What's this
Mata Hari crap?

962
01:04:29,256 --> 01:04:31,215
Do we take Cuba
back or not?

963
01:04:31,258 --> 01:04:33,217
I've got 150 men on
government payroll

964
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:35,262
playing cowboys and Indians
in the Everglades.

965
01:04:35,306 --> 01:04:36,873
I've got Giancana
and the CIA

966
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:38,962
crawling up my ass
looking for results!

967
01:04:39,005 --> 01:04:42,139
Give me the word,
I guarantee Castro's head
in a box by Christmas.

968
01:04:47,187 --> 01:04:50,190
I'm not a whore.

969
01:04:50,234 --> 01:04:52,584
You want to kill somebody,
don't you?

970
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:54,107
Yes.

971
01:04:54,151 --> 01:04:55,935
That's good.

972
01:05:21,395 --> 01:05:23,484
We can't send you in
without some kind of training.

973
01:05:23,528 --> 01:05:25,008
The Cubans
have an army.

974
01:05:25,051 --> 01:05:26,835
I was with them,
little girl.

975
01:05:26,879 --> 01:05:29,055
They come up against
some U.S. mojo,
they'll fold.

976
01:05:29,099 --> 01:05:30,491
Bet on that.

977
01:05:32,102 --> 01:05:34,408
So, you're going to do
us all a favor, right?

978
01:05:43,156 --> 01:05:45,202
I've never killed anybody.

979
01:05:46,899 --> 01:05:48,031
I'll show you how.

980
01:05:55,473 --> 01:05:57,344
Let's get
something straight.

981
01:05:57,388 --> 01:05:59,172
Your FBI girlfriend,
Stewart,

982
01:05:59,216 --> 01:06:01,348
worrying about God,
J. Edgar Hoover--

983
01:06:01,392 --> 01:06:03,872
he don't have stones
to jaywalk at midnight.

984
01:06:03,916 --> 01:06:05,613
You're with me now.

985
01:06:05,657 --> 01:06:07,006
I don't care about
your baby.

986
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,486
I don't care about
your soul.

987
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:10,531
You will do your job.

988
01:06:10,575 --> 01:06:12,794
Screw up, you die.

989
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:13,926
Understood?

990
01:06:16,146 --> 01:06:17,147
Do you understand?

991
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,544
Make yourself at home.

992
01:07:10,678 --> 01:07:13,203
Got some intelligence in.

993
01:07:13,246 --> 01:07:17,598
Castro will be
delivering a broadcast
on Cuban television.

994
01:07:17,642 --> 01:07:22,690
It's a scheduled address,
so he's got to be on time.

995
01:07:22,734 --> 01:07:24,475
And the studio
is in Havana,

996
01:07:24,518 --> 01:07:30,350
so in all likelihood
he'll stay at the Hilton.

997
01:07:30,394 --> 01:07:33,092
When?

998
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:35,007
Tomorrow.

999
01:07:42,101 --> 01:07:43,363
What is it?

1000
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:45,017
Botulism capsules.

1001
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:47,106
One's enough,
two for insurance.

1002
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:49,630
Put them in a cold drink.

1003
01:07:49,674 --> 01:07:51,067
Then what?

1004
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:54,505
Then you get out of there
quickly and quietly.

1005
01:07:54,548 --> 01:07:56,115
There won't be
anything to see.

1006
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:58,465
It'll just be like
he's asleep.

1007
01:07:58,509 --> 01:08:01,120
Now, the CIA will be in
the lobby covering you.

1008
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:02,513
Go to the airport,

1009
01:08:02,556 --> 01:08:05,298
and you'll be home
in 30 minutes.

1010
01:08:05,342 --> 01:08:07,126
What if it doesn't work?

1011
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:10,434
Well, then you sure as hell
better break his neck.

1012
01:08:10,477 --> 01:08:13,393
[line tone] It's coming through, sir.

1013
01:08:13,437 --> 01:08:14,742
Marita.

1014
01:08:21,532 --> 01:08:23,621
Celia: Dígame.

1015
01:08:23,664 --> 01:08:26,711
Celia? It's Marita.

1016
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:30,454
Can I talk to him?

1017
01:08:30,497 --> 01:08:33,544
Celia:  
What do you want?

1018
01:08:33,587 --> 01:08:35,023
Can I talk to Fidel?

1019
01:08:35,067 --> 01:08:37,548
Celia: What do you want  
to tell him?

1020
01:08:39,419 --> 01:08:41,769
That I'm coming home.

1021
01:08:41,813 --> 01:08:43,249
Celia:  
When?

1022
01:08:45,469 --> 01:08:46,905
Tomorrow.

1023
01:09:03,965 --> 01:09:06,098
Stay in line.
Stay in line.

1024
01:09:10,233 --> 01:09:12,713
Great.
They're checking
all the bags.

1025
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:02,415
Gracias.

1026
01:11:23,757 --> 01:11:26,456
You have been with some
very bad people, alemanita.

1027
01:11:28,545 --> 01:11:32,200
FBI, CIA, traitors.

1028
01:11:32,244 --> 01:11:35,291
You think I don't know?

1029
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:36,814
They say you're the bad one.

1030
01:11:39,338 --> 01:11:40,513
Do you believe them?

1031
01:11:48,826 --> 01:11:51,916
I have to make a speech
in a few hours.

1032
01:11:53,570 --> 01:11:55,354
I need to sleep.

1033
01:11:58,401 --> 01:11:59,750
Now you sleep.

1034
01:11:59,793 --> 01:12:03,101
I'm so tired, alemanita.

1035
01:12:05,146 --> 01:12:10,195
You were the only one
who can keep me calm,

1036
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:12,240
and then you left.

1037
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:19,073
What happened
to the baby?

1038
01:12:19,117 --> 01:12:23,991
The boys of Cuban fathers
belong to Cuba.

1039
01:12:24,035 --> 01:12:25,384
What do you mean?

1040
01:12:25,428 --> 01:12:30,041
Do you really think
I would kill my son?

1041
01:12:31,477 --> 01:12:36,743
I found the doctor--
Cubano, a butcher.

1042
01:12:36,787 --> 01:12:40,486
He confessed to nothing.

1043
01:12:40,530 --> 01:12:43,184
He went to the wall.

1044
01:12:43,228 --> 01:12:45,056
Is my baby alive?

1045
01:12:45,099 --> 01:12:49,321
First, you say
who do you trust--

1046
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:53,281
Fidel or his enemies?

1047
01:12:53,325 --> 01:12:56,110
I don't trust anyone.

1048
01:12:56,154 --> 01:13:00,027
Then what does it
matter what I say?

1049
01:13:00,071 --> 01:13:02,813
You have to think,  
alemanita,

1050
01:13:02,856 --> 01:13:07,644
about what
the bad people you are with
are willing to do.

1051
01:13:07,687 --> 01:13:12,736
What crimes?
What lies to hurt me?

1052
01:13:18,742 --> 01:13:22,267
You stay in Cuba.

1053
01:13:22,310 --> 01:13:27,707
You rest,
and then you will see,

1054
01:13:27,751 --> 01:13:30,841
it will be all right.

1055
01:13:30,884 --> 01:13:33,452
All right for you.

1056
01:13:33,496 --> 01:13:35,976
It won't ever be
all right for me.

1057
01:13:37,848 --> 01:13:39,850
Pobrecita.

1058
01:14:01,088 --> 01:14:02,394
I'll be right back.

1059
01:15:34,878 --> 01:15:37,010
Did they send
you here to kill me?

1060
01:15:40,274 --> 01:15:41,275
Yes.

1061
01:15:47,804 --> 01:15:50,328
You are a soldier now,  
alemanita.

1062
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,519
Do what you came for.

1063
01:16:41,727 --> 01:16:47,167
You see,
nobody can kill Fidel.

1064
01:16:51,476 --> 01:16:52,956
Nobody.

1065
01:17:13,716 --> 01:17:15,282
What's the word?

1066
01:17:15,326 --> 01:17:16,588
It's over.

1067
01:17:21,593 --> 01:17:23,900
Something wrong
with the food?

1068
01:17:23,943 --> 01:17:25,466
I can't eat.

1069
01:17:30,558 --> 01:17:32,517
It's 8:30.

1070
01:17:33,736 --> 01:17:35,868
Turn it on.Yes, sir.

1071
01:17:40,133 --> 01:17:41,657
Fidel: Our agreement  
with the Soviets

1072
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:45,095
is good for Cuba  
in every respect.

1073
01:17:45,138 --> 01:17:46,792
A million tons  
of sugar a year

1074
01:17:46,836 --> 01:17:49,316
for the next four years.

1075
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:50,317
In the Soviet Union...

1076
01:17:50,361 --> 01:17:53,016
I didn't do it.

1077
01:17:53,059 --> 01:17:57,542
I could have...

1078
01:17:57,585 --> 01:17:59,413
but I didn't do it.

1079
01:18:04,854 --> 01:18:07,117
You stupid lying whore!

1080
01:18:09,162 --> 01:18:10,424
You screwed us!

1081
01:18:13,645 --> 01:18:14,602
Leave her alone.

1082
01:18:27,485 --> 01:18:28,791
Get out.

1083
01:18:37,756 --> 01:18:40,237
Cuba was great,
you know that?

1084
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:45,242
Great action, dope,
great skirts.

1085
01:18:45,285 --> 01:18:47,331
Cuba was beautiful.

1086
01:18:51,204 --> 01:18:53,772
I'm sorry.

1087
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,603
You're what?

1088
01:18:58,646 --> 01:19:03,042
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1089
01:19:04,478 --> 01:19:05,958
Get on your knees.

1090
01:19:08,395 --> 01:19:09,788
Go on.

1091
01:19:09,832 --> 01:19:11,442
You know how to do that,
don't you?

1092
01:19:11,485 --> 01:19:13,618
Come on and show me.

1093
01:19:24,629 --> 01:19:26,022
On your knees.

1094
01:19:50,786 --> 01:19:53,049
When you see your mother,
say thank you...

1095
01:19:58,489 --> 01:20:00,447
...for the bullet
that's not in your head.

1096
01:20:22,556 --> 01:20:26,256
Why didn't
Frank Sturgis kill me?

1097
01:20:26,299 --> 01:20:28,258
I don't know who that is.

1098
01:20:28,301 --> 01:20:29,868
He works for the CIA.

1099
01:20:29,912 --> 01:20:31,696
Marita, why don't we attempt

1100
01:20:31,739 --> 01:20:33,263
to have a civilized
conversation?

1101
01:20:33,306 --> 01:20:36,614
My baby's alive, isn't he?

1102
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:41,140
There's nothing
to be gained--

1103
01:20:41,184 --> 01:20:45,318
Did they tell you
the truth at the hospital?

1104
01:20:45,362 --> 01:20:47,494
Were you lying
to me then?

1105
01:20:52,325 --> 01:20:57,287
These people, our people,
are fighting a war.

1106
01:20:57,330 --> 01:20:59,158
Do you think that
they care?

1107
01:20:59,202 --> 01:21:01,421
Do you think it
matters to them what you
and I haven't done?

1108
01:21:01,465 --> 01:21:04,337
What I haven't done?

1109
01:21:12,606 --> 01:21:14,217
What is it?

1110
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:16,784
What do you
want to say?

1111
01:21:16,828 --> 01:21:20,484
I just--

1112
01:21:20,527 --> 01:21:23,008
I just wish there
was some way...

1113
01:21:25,054 --> 01:21:26,664
What?

1114
01:21:30,407 --> 01:21:32,844
I wish you could understand.
That's all.

1115
01:21:44,247 --> 01:21:45,813
Man: Alice Lorenz
devoted her life

1116
01:21:45,857 --> 01:21:48,381
to the preservation
of the United States.

1117
01:21:48,425 --> 01:21:50,775
She served bravely in
the overseas Secret Service

1118
01:21:50,818 --> 01:21:52,559
working under
dangerous conditions

1119
01:21:52,603 --> 01:21:54,779
within wartime
Germany itself.

1120
01:21:54,822 --> 01:21:58,348
After the war,
she continued the fight
to preserve the freedoms

1121
01:21:58,391 --> 01:22:01,394
that so many of us
take for granted.

1122
01:22:01,438 --> 01:22:03,570
She was a dutiful wife,

1123
01:22:03,614 --> 01:22:06,138
a loving mother,
and was preceded in death

1124
01:22:06,182 --> 01:22:08,880
by her loving husband,
Heinrich.

1125
01:22:16,409 --> 01:22:18,890
Marita?

1126
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:20,022
Yes?

1127
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:21,371
Left the kids at home,
I see.

1128
01:22:21,414 --> 01:22:22,415
That's probably wise,

1129
01:22:22,459 --> 01:22:24,156
considering
the complications.

1130
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,592
What do you want?

1131
01:22:25,636 --> 01:22:26,985
You're not invisible,
Marita.

1132
01:22:27,029 --> 01:22:28,160
We know where you live.

1133
01:22:28,204 --> 01:22:29,988
We know about
your ex-husbands.

1134
01:22:30,032 --> 01:22:31,816
We know what kind of
car you drive.

1135
01:22:31,859 --> 01:22:33,339
We know you were
working at Fort Chaffee
as a translator

1136
01:22:33,383 --> 01:22:35,907
for that trash that Castro
let out of prison.

1137
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,953
We like to keep you honest.

1138
01:22:40,216 --> 01:22:43,393
Your mother wanted me
to give this to you.

1139
01:22:43,436 --> 01:22:45,612
What is it?

1140
01:22:45,656 --> 01:22:47,092
Call it a favor.

1141
01:23:55,508 --> 01:23:58,163
[phone ringing]

1142
01:24:01,732 --> 01:24:04,604
[ringing continues]

1143
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:14,527
Bueno?

1144
01:24:16,007 --> 01:24:18,183
Thank you.
I'll be right down.

1145
01:24:53,827 --> 01:24:55,220
How do I look?

1146
01:24:59,050 --> 01:25:01,792
Good for an old man.

1147
01:25:07,276 --> 01:25:11,193
They are all gone,  
alemanita.

1148
01:25:11,236 --> 01:25:14,326
Camillo, El Che...

1149
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:18,330
Celia died last year.

1150
01:25:18,374 --> 01:25:20,767
Broke my heart.

1151
01:25:20,811 --> 01:25:21,725
You're still here.

1152
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:29,472
My doctors say not to smoke
so much the cigars.

1153
01:25:47,403 --> 01:25:48,578
I'd like to see him now.

1154
01:25:51,233 --> 01:25:52,103
Andre!

1155
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:13,255
Señora,I'm pleased
to meet you.

1156
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:18,651
I have something
for you.

1157
01:26:22,394 --> 01:26:26,006
100 percent American,

1158
01:26:26,050 --> 01:26:28,835
which means they were
probably made in Pakistan.

1159
01:26:28,879 --> 01:26:32,099
Thank you, señora.

1160
01:26:32,143 --> 01:26:34,189
He's going to be a doctor.

1161
01:26:34,232 --> 01:26:35,625
What kind?

1162
01:26:35,668 --> 01:26:37,627
I don't know,
maybe pediatrician.

1163
01:26:39,106 --> 01:26:41,065
He's the best in his class.

1164
01:26:41,108 --> 01:26:43,807
He knows more than
his teachers.

1165
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:46,766
But he cannot hit a baseball
to save his life.

1166
01:26:50,466 --> 01:26:53,077
Señora,
 you are my mother.

1167
01:26:54,774 --> 01:26:57,995
I want to say
that I honor you.

1168
01:26:58,038 --> 01:26:59,910
The woman who raised me...

1169
01:27:06,003 --> 01:27:06,960
well, the woman
who raised me,

1170
01:27:07,004 --> 01:27:08,527
she's my mother, too.

1171
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:12,662
A grandmother
from La Maestra,

1172
01:27:12,705 --> 01:27:15,142
part of the family.

1173
01:27:15,186 --> 01:27:17,188
She has been old forever.

1174
01:27:24,151 --> 01:27:27,503
I'm still very proud of you,
if that's all right.

1175
01:27:37,861 --> 01:27:41,081
Excuse me, señora.

1176
01:27:41,125 --> 01:27:42,474
I have to go to class.

1177
01:27:56,314 --> 01:27:58,403
Why didn't you tell me
he was alive?

1178
01:27:58,447 --> 01:28:00,405
You were there
to kill me.

1179
01:28:00,449 --> 01:28:03,843
I didn't.

1180
01:28:07,325 --> 01:28:09,762
You should stay here,  
alemanita.

1181
01:28:11,590 --> 01:28:15,768
If Cuba is not your home,
where then?

1182
01:28:22,209 --> 01:28:24,516
When are the elections,
Fidel?

1183
01:28:31,393 --> 01:28:32,872
Do you miss me?

1184
01:28:38,443 --> 01:28:40,315
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

1185
01:28:41,881 --> 01:28:43,405
Of course.

1186
01:28:58,637 --> 01:29:01,379
My little assassin.

1187
01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:25,142
[PA chatter]

1188
01:29:37,633 --> 01:29:39,591
You have a nice trip,
Marita?

1189
01:29:39,635 --> 01:29:40,897
We'd love to talk about it.

1190
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:42,681
It's in everyone's
best interest.

1191
01:29:42,725 --> 01:29:44,074
Yours, the country's.

1192
01:29:46,990 --> 01:29:48,818
It's one side
or the other.

1193
01:29:48,861 --> 01:29:51,298
It's up to you, Marita.
