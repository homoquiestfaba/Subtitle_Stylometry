1
00:01:05,852 --> 00:01:07,410
Oh, Tabatha...

2
00:01:07,612 --> 00:01:10,445
...your daddy's gonna be
awfully proud of you this evening.

3
00:01:10,652 --> 00:01:13,564
Imagine. Pointing at your age.

4
00:01:14,732 --> 00:01:17,883
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, darling.

5
00:01:19,692 --> 00:01:22,365
Hello, Tabatha.
Did you have a nice day today?

6
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:25,040
Well, we had
a very important day today.

7
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,846
Darling, you have
a most unusual daughter.

8
00:01:28,052 --> 00:01:29,280
Well, what makes you say that?

9
00:01:29,492 --> 00:01:33,041
Well, not many little girls can
do what she did at her age.

10
00:01:33,252 --> 00:01:35,482
Well, what did she do
that was so unusual?

11
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:38,809
She pointed at that lamp.

12
00:01:39,252 --> 00:01:40,685
Well, what did it do?

13
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:43,167
- What?
- The lamp.

14
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:45,761
Well, lamps don't do anything.

15
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,883
But she pointed at it.

16
00:01:48,092 --> 00:01:50,845
Oh, Darrin, this has nothing
to do with witchcraft.

17
00:01:51,052 --> 00:01:53,520
She simply pointed at the lamp.
I thought you'd be pleased.

18
00:01:53,732 --> 00:01:56,610
I am pleased.
And very relieved.

19
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:58,040
Well, all right.

20
00:01:58,252 --> 00:02:01,722
I'll go and fix dinner and you
hang on to her for a while, huh?

21
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:03,365
Okay.

22
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:09,249
Sweetheart, I apologize
for accusing you...

23
00:02:09,452 --> 00:02:12,285
...of having any hocus-pocus
with that there lamp.

24
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,401
Sam. Sam!

25
00:02:16,612 --> 00:02:18,170
What's the matter?

26
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:21,011
Honey, it must've been a delayed
reaction. The lamp... It went...

27
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:23,772
- The lamp... It went on by itself.
- Oh, Darrin.

28
00:02:23,972 --> 00:02:26,440
Well, then how do you
explain how it went on?

29
00:02:26,652 --> 00:02:29,120
Well, I can't exactly explain
it technically.

30
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:31,004
It's a big mystery to me too.

31
00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:33,885
- It is?
- Yes.

32
00:02:34,092 --> 00:02:36,765
But, as I walked out of the room...

33
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:40,931
...I flicked this switch right here
and the light went on.

34
00:02:41,372 --> 00:02:42,930
Oh, is that all?

35
00:02:43,132 --> 00:02:45,009
Is that all?

36
00:02:45,212 --> 00:02:47,885
Well, I think that's remarkable.

37
00:02:48,092 --> 00:02:49,525
Look.

38
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,531
Off.

39
00:02:52,052 --> 00:02:53,371
On.

40
00:02:55,212 --> 00:02:57,407
Now, that's what I call magic.

41
00:03:48,372 --> 00:03:51,523
Well, have you recovered from
the marvels of electricity yet?

42
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,200
Thank you. And don't rub it in.

43
00:03:54,412 --> 00:03:55,845
Anything else happen today?

44
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:57,280
No...

45
00:03:57,932 --> 00:04:00,844
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Gladys Kravitz telephoned.

46
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:03,008
She wants us to come over
and watch television.

47
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:06,363
- How come?
- Well, it's kind of a special occasion.

48
00:04:06,572 --> 00:04:08,449
You remember
Gladys' brother, Louis?

49
00:04:08,932 --> 00:04:12,242
How could I ever forget Louis Gruber,
the chicken fiddler?

50
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,010
Well, he isn't chicken anymore.

51
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,565
He's played a number of concerts.

52
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:18,047
Tonight he's making his debut
on national television.

53
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:19,480
He owes it all to you, Sam.

54
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:23,643
- All he needed was a little confidence.
- Well, you sure gave it to him.

55
00:04:23,852 --> 00:04:26,161
Yeah, much against
your wishes as I recall.

56
00:04:26,372 --> 00:04:28,442
You were pregnant at the time.

57
00:04:28,652 --> 00:04:30,643
And you didn't want me
overexerting my nose?

58
00:04:30,852 --> 00:04:32,001
No.

59
00:04:32,212 --> 00:04:34,362
Let's just hope this
evening is not as disastrous...

60
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:36,483
...as the last time
we visited the Kravitz's.

61
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:39,286
That was a bit of a fiasco, wasn't it?

62
00:04:39,492 --> 00:04:43,280
It all started with the banana cake,
as I remember.

63
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:46,847
Honey, do I really have to
wear a tie?

64
00:04:47,052 --> 00:04:49,691
Yes, you have to wear a tie.
And hurry up. We'll be late.

65
00:04:49,892 --> 00:04:52,326
I could be about three days
late for this thing.

66
00:04:52,532 --> 00:04:55,444
We'll probably sit around all night
listening to him play the violin.

67
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:57,051
I hope he does play.

68
00:04:57,252 --> 00:04:59,766
He's supposed to be very talented.
Mrs. Kravitz said so.

69
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:02,202
What do you expect Mrs. Kravitz
to say about her brother?

70
00:05:02,412 --> 00:05:04,209
You should hear
what Mr. Kravitz said.

71
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:05,765
Oh, that reminds me.

72
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,122
I promised to take a banana cake
over for dessert.

73
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:09,765
Why?

74
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:11,730
Well, evidently Louis is a big eater.

75
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:14,810
Besides, I know you like my banana
cake better than Mrs. Kravtiz's.

76
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:17,321
Well, at least you peel the bananas.

77
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:19,928
It looks marvellous.

78
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:21,929
What recipe did you use?

79
00:05:22,132 --> 00:05:24,043
Oh, it was one of
those instant mixes.

80
00:05:24,252 --> 00:05:25,367
Hello, neighbours.

81
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:26,721
- Hi.
- Hi.

82
00:05:26,932 --> 00:05:28,570
Louis will be down in a minute.

83
00:05:28,772 --> 00:05:29,841
I can't wait.

84
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:32,646
Oh, please, please,
sit down. Sit down.

85
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:38,806
Louis said that if he's in the mood,
he'll play for us tonight.

86
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:40,570
Oh, that's marvellous.

87
00:05:40,772 --> 00:05:43,127
And if she's in the mood,
she'll dance.

88
00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:45,004
Go ahead, get your tambourine.

89
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:48,602
Abner, Louis is only here
once a year.

90
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:50,291
Like locusts.

91
00:05:50,492 --> 00:05:53,006
It's only a stopover.

92
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:55,887
He's going on tour very soon.

93
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:57,684
On tour of relatives.

94
00:05:57,892 --> 00:06:01,567
He goes from one to the other
with an open hand and open mouth.

95
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:06,089
He happens to be a brilliant violinist.

96
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:10,365
"A Genius of the First Magnitude."
<i>Buffalo Daily R</i>e<i>cord.</i>

97
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:14,000
Ask her if he works.
Go ahead, ask her.

98
00:06:14,212 --> 00:06:16,772
He's just between engagements.

99
00:06:16,972 --> 00:06:19,281
Twenty-six years
between engagements.

100
00:06:19,892 --> 00:06:21,484
He should go out and get a job.

101
00:06:21,692 --> 00:06:23,887
He can't get an ordinary job...

102
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:26,610
...he'd hurt his hands.

103
00:06:26,812 --> 00:06:28,530
Then let him take
a job with his feet.

104
00:06:29,852 --> 00:06:32,525
Maybe we should come back
some other time.

105
00:06:32,732 --> 00:06:34,643
Why? It won't get any better.

106
00:06:35,052 --> 00:06:36,963
Oh, good evening.

107
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:39,128
Oh, good, you brought the cake.

108
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,892
This is my brother, Louis Gruber.
Mr. And Mrs. Stephens.

109
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:44,766
- Hello.
- How do you do?

110
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:47,048
Easy.

111
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:48,480
Thank you.

112
00:06:48,932 --> 00:06:52,049
Mrs. Kravitz said you were
about to go on tour.

113
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:55,203
Yes. L...

114
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:57,687
I had been giving it some thought.

115
00:06:57,892 --> 00:07:00,690
I think that's wonderful.
When would it be?

116
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:04,248
One doesn't measure
these things by time.

117
00:07:04,452 --> 00:07:05,680
He measures them by free meals.

118
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:08,607
Mrs. Kravitz was saying
you were only 9 years old...

119
00:07:08,812 --> 00:07:10,325
...when you played in Carnegie Hall.

120
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:14,844
Please, don't mention Carnegie.
That was my last performance.

121
00:07:15,052 --> 00:07:16,246
And what a performance.

122
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:17,567
Sounds interesting.

123
00:07:17,892 --> 00:07:21,851
Full house, standing room.

124
00:07:22,412 --> 00:07:23,606
I don't wanna talk about it.

125
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:26,884
I wouldn't talk about it either
if my knickers fell down.

126
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:29,443
Three encores he got.

127
00:07:30,292 --> 00:07:31,930
Gladys, he's doing it again.

128
00:07:32,132 --> 00:07:34,202
- Abner!
- I was telling the truth.

129
00:07:34,492 --> 00:07:37,325
Gladys, let's eat.

130
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:39,682
Louis wants to eat. Let's eat.
Are you ready to eat?

131
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,325
Let's everybody eat. Shall we eat?

132
00:07:41,532 --> 00:07:43,204
Come on, let's eat.
Louis, ready to eat?

133
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:45,443
You wanna see a great artist?

134
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,400
That's where he does his best work.

135
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:58,650
During his career,
Louis met very important people.

136
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:04,123
Kings, queens, dukes, dictators.

137
00:08:04,332 --> 00:08:07,483
Yup. Those were the days.

138
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:10,486
It's not easy reaching
your prime when you're 9.

139
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:12,284
But what about your new tour?

140
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,449
Won't be the same.

141
00:08:14,652 --> 00:08:18,645
There are certain things in life
that happen only once and then...

142
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:20,401
...gone forever.

143
00:08:20,612 --> 00:08:22,364
Like that meat loaf.
Did you see it go?

144
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:24,244
Abner, Louis is talking.

145
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:25,641
At least he's not eating.

146
00:08:27,012 --> 00:08:28,730
Louis, I'm sure you'll be
a success again.

147
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:30,809
I don't think people have
forgotten you.

148
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:33,003
How could they?
His knickers fell down.

149
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:36,731
Sam's right. A man with your talent
shouldn't have any trouble.

150
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:39,810
Talent?
What's the meaning of talent?

151
00:08:40,012 --> 00:08:41,570
Who's got talent now? Who?

152
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:43,691
Well, Heifetz.

153
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,290
He plays with his thumbs.

154
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:48,843
Heifetz? He's brilliant.

155
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:50,531
He should play the square dance.

156
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:52,405
Well, what about Isaac Stern?

157
00:08:52,612 --> 00:08:54,682
Plays a pizzicato
like I pick my teeth.

158
00:08:55,212 --> 00:08:56,884
Well, then, why are
these men on top?

159
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:59,447
Politics. It's who you know.
It's knowing people.

160
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:02,809
You know how Stern got
where he is today?

161
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:04,881
He knew Heifetz.

162
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:06,884
They must've had some talent.

163
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:10,368
Talent, yes. Genius, no.

164
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:13,405
That's why they're afraid of me.
I've got genius.

165
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:16,524
"A Rising Genius
on the Concert Horizon."

166
00:09:16,732 --> 00:09:18,211
<i>St. Louis H</i>e<i>rald.</i>

167
00:09:19,212 --> 00:09:21,089
They're all against me.
It's common knowledge.

168
00:09:21,412 --> 00:09:24,051
Well, Louis if you're as good
as you say you are, then...

169
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:28,123
You don't think I can play, do you?

170
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:30,209
Well, I didn't say that...

171
00:09:30,412 --> 00:09:32,721
Say it. I'm a fraud.

172
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:36,091
- You're a fraud.
- Darrin, please.

173
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:38,323
It doesn't really matter.

174
00:09:38,532 --> 00:09:40,250
I know I'm a genius.

175
00:09:40,532 --> 00:09:44,207
"A Born Virtuoso." Arturo Toscanini.

176
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:46,449
"Born Eater." Abner Kravitz.

177
00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:48,888
I am a proven artist.

178
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:51,322
Three world tours,
two gold records...

179
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:52,760
One snapshot.

180
00:09:53,052 --> 00:09:54,690
Your little knickers on the floor.

181
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:57,402
Laugh, clown, laugh.

182
00:09:57,612 --> 00:09:59,762
But I'll have the last laugh.

183
00:10:01,932 --> 00:10:03,888
Abner! How could you do that?

184
00:10:04,092 --> 00:10:06,447
- You know he's so sensitive.
- Sensitive?

185
00:10:06,652 --> 00:10:07,767
He's scared stiff.

186
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:10,361
Since the knickers, he can't
play in front of an audience.

187
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,961
That's not true.

188
00:10:14,252 --> 00:10:17,289
It's Heifetz and Stern
and the rest of the crowd.

189
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,403
They won't give him a chance.

190
00:10:19,812 --> 00:10:23,009
I still think if he has
that much talent, he should...

191
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,003
Now, watch this.

192
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,884
Bravo!

193
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,045
I don't believe it.

194
00:11:33,252 --> 00:11:35,925
He was extraordinary. Wasn't he?

195
00:11:36,132 --> 00:11:38,327
No, not that.
He's gonna miss dessert.

196
00:11:44,932 --> 00:11:47,730
And you thought it was
gonna be a dull evening.

197
00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:53,371
Well, I don't know who gave the better
performance, Louis or Mr. Kravitz.

198
00:11:53,572 --> 00:11:56,405
It's too bad he hasn't had
a chance to play.

199
00:11:56,612 --> 00:11:58,921
Well, you heard what Abner said.
He's scared.

200
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:03,125
- And I'm inclined to agree with him.
- All he needs is a little push.

201
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:06,529
Well, if he stays with Abner,
he'll get it right out the window.

202
00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:10,209
Louis could play at the
hospital benefit, Saturday.

203
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:12,841
- Sam, don't...
- There'll be a big crowd...

204
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:16,249
...lots of important people.
Might be good for his confidence.

205
00:12:16,452 --> 00:12:18,443
Sam, you're a housewife,
not Sol Hurok.

206
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:21,530
I could call the entertainment
committee. It wouldn't be any trouble.

207
00:12:21,732 --> 00:12:24,200
Sam, stay out if it, please.

208
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:27,324
Louis needs a chance.
The hospital needs money.

209
00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:28,806
It's a perfect plan.

210
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:31,242
So was Custer's.

211
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:42,283
- You're still at it?
- You know I have to practice.

212
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:45,040
Since 5:00 this morning?

213
00:12:45,252 --> 00:12:46,924
When am I gonna get
some peace and quiet?

214
00:12:47,132 --> 00:12:49,646
Abner, let him alone.
He's practicing. Go for a walk.

215
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,320
I've been for a walk seven times
around the block already.

216
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:54,841
The neighbours think I'm...
I'm a peddler.

217
00:12:55,052 --> 00:12:57,612
- I cannot practice in this atmosphere.
- Good.

218
00:12:57,812 --> 00:13:00,565
Abner, if he stops practicing,
he'll lose his touch.

219
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:04,048
If he doesn't stop,
he'll lose his teeth.

220
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:08,211
So you want to hit someone, huh?

221
00:13:08,452 --> 00:13:13,003
- Well, then hit. Hit, hit, hit, hit.
- The feet, the feet, watch the feet.

222
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:16,250
Gladys, think of what you're doing.

223
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:19,127
You've been protecting him
all your life.

224
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:22,051
You've treated him like a baby.
That's why he can't get a job.

225
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:23,401
A big baby!

226
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:26,804
I've tried to get jobs, dozens of them,
but they won't have me.

227
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:28,127
What about Philadelphia?

228
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:31,290
- That wasn't my fault. I was sick.
- Sick?

229
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:33,125
You were afraid.

230
00:13:33,332 --> 00:13:36,210
He was sick. You know
he had fever, he was white.

231
00:13:36,412 --> 00:13:38,846
He was yellow.
He chickened out.

232
00:13:39,052 --> 00:13:40,849
He's the chicken fiddler.

233
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,721
I don't have to take this.

234
00:13:44,932 --> 00:13:47,127
- I'm leaving.
- Good.

235
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:50,482
Only the room.

236
00:13:50,692 --> 00:13:53,889
Louis, please.
Stay here and practice.

237
00:13:54,092 --> 00:13:56,686
- For how long?
- Another hour.

238
00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:59,008
Abner, he's got to perfect
his technique.

239
00:13:59,212 --> 00:14:00,964
Keep his fingers in shape.

240
00:14:01,212 --> 00:14:02,611
Why, we're having hot biscuits again?

241
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:05,443
You'll be proud of me one day.

242
00:14:05,652 --> 00:14:08,883
When I'm back at Carnegie Hall and
I have the whole world at my feet.

243
00:14:09,092 --> 00:14:10,969
That's better than your knickers.

244
00:14:11,172 --> 00:14:12,127
Come in.

245
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:15,650
Hi, I've got great news.
I've arranged everything.

246
00:14:15,852 --> 00:14:18,286
- Louis, you're gonna give a concert.
- A concert?

247
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:20,926
Yes, Saturday matinee,
the Hospital Benefit.

248
00:14:21,132 --> 00:14:23,282
- Is there an audience?
- Oh, yes. It'll be a sell-out.

249
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:25,210
At least 500 people.

250
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:27,448
Five hundred people.

251
00:14:36,652 --> 00:14:39,246
I know you're trying to help,
Mrs. Stephens...

252
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:41,727
...but you've gotta get Louis
out of this.

253
00:14:41,932 --> 00:14:43,160
L... I can't.

254
00:14:43,372 --> 00:14:46,762
The programs are printed and
the tickets are sold. Tell him that.

255
00:14:46,972 --> 00:14:49,691
I did. He fainted again.

256
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:53,448
Now, Mrs. Kravitz, I know this
will be the best thing for him.

257
00:14:53,652 --> 00:14:55,882
He's been ready for 26 years.

258
00:14:56,452 --> 00:14:57,851
He's a big boy now.

259
00:14:58,252 --> 00:15:00,607
He's going to have to
face himself some time.

260
00:15:00,812 --> 00:15:02,291
What am I gonna do?

261
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:04,449
You won't have to do a thing.

262
00:15:04,652 --> 00:15:06,608
Just leave him to me.
I'll get him to play.

263
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:09,372
My baby brother,
growing up so fast.

264
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:11,244
Hi, Mrs. Kravitz.

265
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:14,171
Soon he'll be going out with girls.

266
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:17,842
Oh, how soon we lose them.

267
00:15:18,612 --> 00:15:20,204
What's wrong with her?

268
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:24,087
Oh, she's just worried about
Louis and the concert.

269
00:15:24,572 --> 00:15:27,962
Sam, what are you getting
involved in this for?

270
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:32,006
Well, I am kind of responsible.
I got him into it.

271
00:15:32,212 --> 00:15:34,965
Besides, he's a great violinist.
And he should be heard.

272
00:15:35,172 --> 00:15:36,605
Poor Gladys.

273
00:15:36,812 --> 00:15:40,407
Poor Gladys? Poor Abner.
Putting up with all that practicing.

274
00:15:40,612 --> 00:15:42,648
Well, don't worry.

275
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:45,366
Abner won't be bothered
by that anymore.

276
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:47,005
Why?

277
00:15:47,492 --> 00:15:50,643
Because Louis is gonna
do his practicing here.

278
00:15:54,092 --> 00:15:56,652
Louis Gruber does not play benefits.

279
00:15:56,852 --> 00:15:58,649
Why not? Everybody else does.

280
00:15:58,852 --> 00:16:01,685
It's all wrong. I don't know why
I came here in the first place.

281
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:03,962
Because I made beef stroganoff.

282
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,766
- Good. Let's eat.
- Practice first.

283
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:09,167
You're going to have to play
for your supper tonight.

284
00:16:09,372 --> 00:16:11,488
Tonight, yes. Tomorrow, no.

285
00:16:12,052 --> 00:16:14,964
Now, Louis, what happened
with your knickers...

286
00:16:15,172 --> 00:16:17,891
...at Carnegie Hall, well,
it's all over and done with.

287
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:19,605
Now, no more excuses.

288
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,848
The concert's tomorrow afternoon.

289
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:25,569
I can't. I can't.

290
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:28,684
Oh, but, now, Louis.
Louis, you were doing beautifully.

291
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:32,806
No, no, it's true
what they say about me.

292
00:16:33,012 --> 00:16:36,800
I am afraid.
I am a coward.

293
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:40,288
I am a chicken fiddler!

294
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:42,204
Practice.

295
00:16:42,412 --> 00:16:44,972
- What's for dinner?
- Never mind.

296
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:47,128
Start playing.

297
00:16:47,332 --> 00:16:48,447
Start playing.

298
00:17:12,652 --> 00:17:17,089
What must be done, must be done!

299
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:30,160
Blast!

300
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:35,885
What is this?

301
00:17:44,052 --> 00:17:46,964
What kind of varnish
are you wearing?

302
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:11,321
Good, good.
I'm glad to see you're still practicing.

303
00:18:17,092 --> 00:18:19,208
What got into you?

304
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,211
You see that?

305
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:24,764
Soup!

306
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:26,166
Gladys made it herself.

307
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:28,408
Chicken noodle
for the chicken fiddler.

308
00:18:28,612 --> 00:18:32,127
Now, Mr. Kravitz,
Louis is doing just fine.

309
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:35,330
Look at him.
I should have brought a funnel.

310
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,171
You go and tell Mrs. Kravitz
everything's gonna be okay.

311
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:40,681
Why? Has the benefit
been cancelled?

312
00:18:40,892 --> 00:18:41,847
No.

313
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:44,248
You be ready at 1:30.
We'll pick you up.

314
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:47,728
All right. Well, for the benefit
of the benefit, I hope he...

315
00:18:49,132 --> 00:18:50,121
Oh, no!

316
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:03,611
He did it. He did it! He did it.

317
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:07,725
Louis, please, believe me, I'm sorry.

318
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,410
Mrs. Stephens, it was an accident.

319
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:12,887
It's perfectly all right.
Don't worry about it.

320
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:14,844
I won't have to play
that benefit tomorrow.

321
00:19:15,052 --> 00:19:16,451
And I really wanted to.

322
00:19:16,692 --> 00:19:18,648
- What can we do?
- Cancel the benefit.

323
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:20,606
No, no.

324
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:23,121
I have another violin in the house.

325
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:27,605
Well, I just can't play any old violin.

326
00:19:36,412 --> 00:19:37,527
Good.

327
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:45,406
I think it's a pretty good one.

328
00:19:45,612 --> 00:19:48,080
It's not as good
as a handmade Dimkis.

329
00:19:52,252 --> 00:19:54,402
Stradivarius!

330
00:19:57,812 --> 00:19:59,689
Gladys said she was bringing
him right over.

331
00:19:59,892 --> 00:20:01,723
I shouldn't have let him
out of my sight.

332
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:04,127
- He's only got 15 minutes.
- Oh, he'll be here.

333
00:20:04,332 --> 00:20:06,641
He knows they're gonna
have cake after the show.

334
00:20:06,852 --> 00:20:08,968
Maybe I should call and find out...

335
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:13,725
It wasn't my fault!

336
00:20:13,932 --> 00:20:15,809
I couldn't do anything!

337
00:20:16,012 --> 00:20:18,651
- What happened?
- I couldn't stop him!

338
00:20:19,012 --> 00:20:20,889
Gladys, what happened?

339
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:22,525
Louis is gone.

340
00:20:23,052 --> 00:20:24,041
What?

341
00:20:24,252 --> 00:20:26,322
He said he was going for a paper.

342
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:28,285
A paper? Where?

343
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:30,528
Philadelphia!

344
00:20:31,252 --> 00:20:33,527
Chicken fiddler strikes again.

345
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,883
He took a cab to the airport.

346
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:38,971
Cab? Who paid?

347
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:42,170
Oh, I knew this would happen.

348
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:49,761
We'll get him back.

349
00:20:59,612 --> 00:21:02,001
Honey, he's only got six minutes.

350
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:05,850
I guess we better call
the whole thing off.

351
00:21:06,052 --> 00:21:10,045
I think we should wait a couple of
minutes. I have a feeling he'll be here.

352
00:21:15,852 --> 00:21:17,365
Hey, what's going on here?

353
00:21:17,572 --> 00:21:20,211
I don't know. Ask the cab.

354
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,323
I gotta get out of here.

355
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:31,130
Louis.

356
00:21:36,132 --> 00:21:37,531
I'll get him.

357
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:46,765
Louis, come back.
That only works in the movies.

358
00:21:48,612 --> 00:21:50,967
He went down in the manhole.

359
00:21:51,732 --> 00:21:53,006
We've got to do something.

360
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:55,362
I know what I'd like to do.
Put the cover on it.

361
00:21:55,572 --> 00:21:57,642
We'll never get him now.

362
00:21:58,132 --> 00:21:59,963
Oh, yes, we will.

363
00:22:08,732 --> 00:22:11,769
- Ready, Louis?
- I was just going for a paper.

364
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:13,325
In the sewer?

365
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:16,410
My baby! My poor baby!

366
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:19,080
That poor baby cost me 7
and a half bucks for a cab.

367
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:20,691
- Come on, Louis.
- No.

368
00:22:20,892 --> 00:22:21,961
- Come on.
- No.

369
00:22:22,172 --> 00:22:25,050
- Here you go, Louis.
- No, no.

370
00:22:25,252 --> 00:22:26,765
- And this one.
- No, no.

371
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:29,486
No. No.

372
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:47,241
My poor baby. What's he doing?

373
00:22:49,052 --> 00:22:51,202
I think he's praying.

374
00:22:51,492 --> 00:22:52,766
No.

375
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,281
I think he's crying.

376
00:22:55,812 --> 00:22:58,326
Louis, Louis!

377
00:23:17,452 --> 00:23:20,922
Sam, is that you or him playing?

378
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:22,645
Oh, I just got him started.

379
00:23:30,532 --> 00:23:32,602
Attaboy, Louis!

380
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,962
Play like you eat.

381
00:23:48,612 --> 00:23:51,365
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.

382
00:23:51,572 --> 00:23:53,608
Louis on a big TV show.

383
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:56,770
That's nothing.
He has so many concerts after this.

384
00:23:57,052 --> 00:23:58,929
Well, Sam, he owes it all to you.

385
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:00,565
That's right, Mrs. Stephens.

386
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,088
That benefit gave him
the confidence.

387
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:06,443
No, no. He has the talent.
I just got him started.

388
00:24:06,652 --> 00:24:08,085
<i>And now, ladi</i>e<i>s and g</i>e<i>ntl</i>e<i>m</i>e<i>n.</i>

389
00:24:08,292 --> 00:24:10,965
<i>Th</i>e <i>world famous violinist,</i>
<i>Louis Grub</i>e<i>r.</i>

390
00:24:11,172 --> 00:24:13,845
Oh, doesn't he look handsome?

391
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:16,725
Except for the chicken soup
on his lapel.

392
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:32,090
Oh, my stars!

393
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:33,685
The knickers routine again.

394
00:24:33,892 --> 00:24:35,928
This time, coast-to-coast.

395
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:38,009
Well, Sam, when's the next benefit?

396
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:30,208
