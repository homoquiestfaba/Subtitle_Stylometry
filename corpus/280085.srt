1
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,600
Hi. How you doing, sweetie?
Come on in.

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,600
I already prepared
everything for you...

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,600
just the way you like it.

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,600
Jeez, it's so hot tonight.

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,600
Are you ready?

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,600
You want me to play dead?

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,200
Do you want me to die, honey?

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,600
Please. Please, let me die for you.

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,800
Why did you close the windows?

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You know I don't scream.

11
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,400
What are you doing, honey?

12
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Is there something wrong?

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,800
What's that?

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,800
You're hurting me!

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Get off! Oh, God!

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,400
Please, help me!

17
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
What do you know about the killer?

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We know he's a male, probably aged...

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,600
Is there a possibility
there's more than one killer?

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,600
No comment.

21
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,800
- You sound confident.
- I am.

22
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,000
- Do we know the killer's race?
- Not definitive.

23
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,400
We are analysing skin samples

24
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,000
taken from underneath
the fingernails of the victims.

25
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,400
Results will help to determine
the killer's race.

26
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,000
Is it true the police aren't
interested in finding the killers

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,400
because the victims
were prostitutes?

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,800
The suggestion that we're not
treating this case diligently

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,400
is not only false but offensive.

30
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,800
We've already spent
1,800 man-hours on this case...

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,400
What do you know about the killer?

32
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,000
I can't tell you
all that we know, but he's male...

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,200
- You got the job. That job?
- Yeah.

34
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,800
Jesus.

35
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,600
That sounds disgusting.

36
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,200
Don't you think? Don't you think
it's just disgusting?

37
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,800
All I gotta do is sit on my ass
all night and read a book.

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,600
- You're drinking too much.
- He's already very drunk.

39
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,400
I think one person
is responsible for these crimes.

40
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,000
- Why do you say that?
- That's my business.

41
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,800
That's all I got to do.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,400
I just got to sit on my ass.
Sit on my ass!

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,400
Inspector.

44
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,200
Is it true the police aren't
interested in finding the killers

45
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,600
because the victims
were prostitutes?

46
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,800
The suggestion that we're
not treating this case diligently

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,800
is not only false but offensive.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
- Is there more than one killer?
- My feeling is one killer.

49
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
- Do you know the killer's race?
- Not definitive.

50
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,600
We are analysing skin samples

51
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,000
taken from underneath
the fingernails of the victims.

52
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,000
Results of those tests...

53
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,600
- Is there more than one killer?
- No comment.

54
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Staying over tonight?

55
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
- Do you want me to?
- Do you want to?

56
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
If you want me to.

57
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,400
Marie, if I've ever done anything
to make you happy, I truly apologise.

58
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,000
These markings could have occurred
after death while the body was...

59
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,800
Sources have confirmed

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,800
that the victims were sexually
assaulted after their deaths.

61
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,200
Is there more than one killer?

62
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,200
It's gotten so hard
to talk her into things.

63
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
She's become less and less...

64
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,400
receptive.

65
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,200
- When will the results come in?
- Soon. Maybe tomorrow.

66
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,600
That guy's supposed to be amazing.

67
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,200
- We can't tell the public every...
- Receptive to what?

68
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,600
Were the victims
sexually assaulted?

69
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,800
What do you think of the killer?

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,400
I think his time is running out.

71
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,600
Katherine!

72
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Katherine?

73
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
I'm in the bathroom!

74
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
What?

75
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Nothing.

76
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,600
You had strange dreams last night.

77
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
I did?

78
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,800
You were breathing really heavy.

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,400
You kept kicking your legs
and moaning.

80
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
- You sure we weren't having sex?
- Pretty sure, yeah.

81
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,000
- Call me and tell me how it went.
- Yeah.

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,200
- Good night.
- Night.

83
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,600
Mr Johnson?

84
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,000
Mr Johnson.

85
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,800
- How did you get in?
- The front door was open.

86
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Damn door never closes.

87
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,800
So, this is you?

88
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,200
- Oh, yeah, this is me.
- Welcome to Mars.

89
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,800
- Sorry?
- They weren't kidding you.

90
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,200
About what?

91
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,800
I'll leave you the coffee machine.
The radio is mine.

92
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,800
- You got a radio?
- No.

93
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Get yourself a radio.

94
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,800
What did they tell you exactly?

95
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,400
Not a lot.

96
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,800
Now there's very few people around,

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,400
but at night,
this place is like Mars.

98
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,600
- So, what have you heard?
- Pardon?

99
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,200
What exactly
did they tell you about me?

100
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,000
- Nothing. They told me nothing.
- Come on. They told you why I quit.

101
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
No, honestly, not at all.

102
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,800
May we come in?

103
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Turn the key till you hear the click.

104
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,400
It registers on a piece of punch tape
verifying you were here every hour.

105
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,800
- I see.
- Do you?

106
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,000
Thank God we don't need to check
this room. The key's outside.

107
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,400
Come, have a look.

108
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,000
It's all right. Come on.

109
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,000
- You know what's in those tubs?
- No. What?

110
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,600
Smell the formaldehyde.
You can smell it, can't you?

111
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,000
You should never go in there. Never.

112
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
I never have.

113
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,200
Disgusting.

114
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,200
- So, I'll be alone here at night.
- Didn't they tell you?

115
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Sometimes, an ambulance or police
comes in, but apart from that,

116
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
it's just you...

117
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,200
and them.

118
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,000
The morgue.

119
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,400
I don't know why
they put a key in there.

120
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,800
The hell with it.
Let's get on with it.

121
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
Just keep your eyes on the key.

122
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
Just keep looking at it.

123
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,400
Don't look at them.

124
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,800
Damned idiots. Why in the hell
did they put a key in here?

125
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,200
What are the cords for?

126
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,600
Just a precaution,
in case one of them wakes up.

127
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,200
- If you pull it, the alarm goes off.
- Wakes up?

128
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,600
Then you call the duty doctor
from the guard's station.

129
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,600
He'll be here in five minutes.
Don't worry. It'll never happen.

130
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,600
It's cold in here, but you can
still smell 'em, can't you?

131
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,600
Yeah.

132
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,400
Make sure the door doesn't close.
No handle on the inside.

133
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,600
- Why would it close?
- And turn out the lights.

134
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,800
This is where it happened,
supposedly.

135
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,400
What?

136
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,400
Some years ago, scandal,
terrible scandal.

137
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,200
Night watchman.

138
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,800
Many years ago...

139
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,400
he did it.

140
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,000
- He did it?
- Did it with them.

141
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,400
- You mean...
- The guy had his very own harem.

142
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,200
Well, I never knew anything about it
firsthand, but the rumour was,

143
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,200
they caught him doing it.

144
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,800
They hushed the whole thing up.

145
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,600
Who knows? Lots of weirdos out here.

146
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
God.

147
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
I'm not a weirdo.

148
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,200
After you've worked here a while,
your breath'll begin to stink.

149
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,800
You can test it by holding your
hand up to your mouth and breathe.

150
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,600
Am I right?

151
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,800
Oh, Jesus! You're right.

152
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Goes with the territory.
Nothing you can do about it.

153
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,400
These are the staff files.
We're all in here somewhere.

154
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,400
Dead ones, over there.
Staff, over here.

155
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,000
Meaningless.

156
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,800
Here's your duty roster.

157
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,800
You'll come on at eight,
be relieved at four.

158
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
- Is that the alarm from...?
- It'll never happen.

159
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,400
Have you got a radio?

160
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,200
- Actually, I'm gonna study.
- Get a radio.

161
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,000
- Like I said, I'll get a radio.
- Good.

162
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,600
Who is that picture of?

163
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,600
I don't know. It's always been there.

164
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Oh, one more thing.

165
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,000
There's nothing
to be afraid of, but...

166
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
I think it'd be
a good thing to have.

167
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
And then the radio...

168
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,000
It'd be a good idea
to buy yourself a radio.

169
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,200
OK.

170
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
You have a choice
of seeing two movies.

171
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,400
One, 90 action-packed minutes
of two heroes spending time together

172
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
having these incredible adventures.

173
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,600
The other movie has 45 minutes of
one hero having incredible adventures

174
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,200
and the other 45 minutes
is a guy sitting at a desk,

175
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,800
reading a book, OK?

176
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Which one do you go see?

177
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,600
Who's playing the guy
reading the book?

178
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,800
There is definitely
loss of consortium,

179
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,600
but how about mental anguish?

180
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,600
- What happened to us?
- What?

181
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,200
I can't breathe in here.
Why the fuck are we here?

182
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,000
- Getting older.
- We're dying.

183
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
- Same thing.
- No, no, no.

184
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,200
You know this movie
I was talking about?

185
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,600
The two heroes start
challenging each other.

186
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,400
- Really?
- Yes. The one who backs down loses.

187
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,400
Why would they want to do that?

188
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,200
Because they're dying
and they wanna play

189
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,000
before they end up in bed
with the establishment.

190
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
OK, so what are the stakes?

191
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,600
If I lose, I marry Marie.
You lose, you marry Katherine.

192
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,600
What?

193
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,600
- Why?
- It's some fun!

194
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You are totally insane.

195
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,600
No, I'm not.

196
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,800
Shit.

197
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Shit, the lights.

198
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,200
Weren't you afraid?

199
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,800
No. No. And then I saw these tubs.

200
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,400
There was something in them.
Spare parts.

201
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,800
I saw shadows or something.
I don't know.

202
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,000
That's really sick.

203
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,000
You're dead. What's it matter
what someone does to you?

204
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,800
I just think it's sick, OK?

205
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,200
I have to go to the bathroom.

206
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,800
Yeah, I'll go with you.

207
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
So, listen.

208
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,200
Yesterday,
I'm down in Camden near Hyde.

209
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,800
I see this
very attractive-looking girl

210
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
standing at a bus stop, right?

211
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,400
But I notice she doesn't get
on any of the buses.

212
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,000
So?

213
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,000
Come on, counsellor.
She was a prostitute.

214
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,600
Seventeen years old. Joyce.

215
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,600
How do you know all that?

216
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:32,400
Excuse me, those are my quarters.
I got the next game.

217
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,600
- Tough shit.
- All right, I'll get the manager.

218
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm gonna go get Satan.

219
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
- It's OK.
- Sure?

220
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Yeah.

221
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,200
Let us just play one game
then you guys can play, all right?

222
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,200
Why you look so scared?
I'm just kidding. You all right?

223
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,400
What did you do to him?
Shake my hand.

224
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,000
I'll just play one game, OK?
I'm sorry.

225
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,200
Damn, baby.
Do fries come with that shake?

226
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,000
Please, get out of my way.

227
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,400
Maybe we should do something, huh?

228
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,600
Let me know if you're interested
in nine inches.

229
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm very interested in nine inches

230
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,800
but not in fucking you three times
to get it.

231
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,200
Such nasty things
coming from such a pretty mouth.

232
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
Where you going?

233
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,000
Did I hurt your feelings? Bitch.

234
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,600
Hi. I hope our little altercation
didn't interrupt your beer-drinking.

235
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,600
We were just discussing
if we should do something.

236
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,600
- Let's go.
- No. We're gonna stay.

237
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:40,000
No, we're not.

238
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I didn't mean you and me.
I meant me and Martin.

239
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,200
Just a little while.

240
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,000
- Assholes.
- I hope you know what you're doing.

241
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,600
You know, if this was the movie and
you were playing the exciting guy...

242
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,400
you'd go over
and show those guys up.

243
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
James. James.

244
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,800
James!

245
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,400
Four, quadruple, Jack.

246
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,800
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready.

247
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
- For what?
- You challenged me.

248
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,000
I take it back.

249
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,000
We're not in grade school.
You can't take it back.

250
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,600
James, don't...

251
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,200
Excuse me.

252
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Hi. I wanted to thank you.

253
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,200
What in the fuck
is you talkin' about, fool?

254
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,000
I wanted to thank you. You know how
long we've been looking for you two?

255
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,800
You're not telling me I'm the first
person to approach you about this?

256
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,200
I'm serious. You guys are gonna be
on talk shows forever.

257
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,400
- Talk shows?
- Oprah, Phil, Sally. You name it.

258
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,800
You like Ricki Lake?

259
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
What the fuck are you talking about?

260
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,600
When I say we've been looking
for two guys like you, I mean it.

261
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,800
- No one's approached you about this?
- No, nobody's approached me.

262
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,200
That's unbelievable.
Un-fucking-believable.

263
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,000
You go on these talk shows -
and there'll be a lot,

264
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,600
you're gonna be
on the road for weeks.

265
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,600
These guys will ask
the same opening questions.

266
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,400
Maybe we should run through it now,
just so you're prepared, huh?

267
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,200
OK.

268
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,200
Yeah? All right, great.

269
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,800
It's a multipart question,
so answer carefully.

270
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,600
Now, we know for certain
that your parents communicated

271
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,400
through a series
of clicks and grunts.

272
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
What we wanna know is how and when

273
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,600
did you acquire
the facility of speech?

274
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,400
All right? Were you the only one in
your group to exhibit this facility?

275
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,800
And when did the majority
of your body fur fall out?

276
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,600
Answer the third part first.

277
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,800
Sure.

278
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,000
Come on back. Let's play some pool.
Where you going?

279
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
- Non-verbal communication...
- You motherfucker!

280
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,600
- Let's do it. Come here!
- You can't be domesticated.

281
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,000
God! Did you see their faces?
That was great!

282
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
"When did the majority
of your body fur fall out?"

283
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,000
Did you see them?

284
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,800
- Fuck!
- You all right?

285
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,600
- Goddamnit.
- Are you hurt?

286
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,600
Let's get out of here.

287
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,400
You know, I fucked her.

288
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,000
Who?

289
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,800
The hooker, Joyce. I fucked her.

290
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,400
You fucked a prostitute?

291
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Jesus, what was it like?

292
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,200
It was fascinating.

293
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,600
She did everything I asked.

294
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,400
Everything.

295
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,600
I'd say, "Stand over there,"
she'd say, "Yes, Martin. "

296
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,400
I'd say, "Lay down,"
she'd say, "Yes, Martin. "

297
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,600
What?

298
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:30,200
- I told her I was you.
- You said you were me. Why?

299
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,200
How would she know
who the fuck you are?

300
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,200
Back at the bar,
you were excited by that.

301
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,400
It was a rush. You felt good.
You felt alive, didn't you?

302
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,000
- Yeah, sure.
- I didn't feel anything. Nothing.

303
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,200
A year ago, I would've felt like you.
I would've felt hyped up, flushed.

304
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,600
But, it's like
my tolerance is increasing

305
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:00,200
and I can't get that feeling any more
and I have to get that feeling.

306
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,000
I just don't get that feeling
and I need it.

307
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,800
I have to, too.

308
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,400
Do you?

309
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,000
Challenge me.

310
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,400
- OK, do it with Joyce.
- What?

311
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,800
- Do it.
- Yeah, yeah!

312
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,200
Come on. What, do you think
this is just for fun?

313
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,800
And we invite her out, OK?

314
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,200
- Katherine.
- Katherine will never know. Come on.

315
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,800
Find an excuse, OK? Friend?

316
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,000
Buddy?

317
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,000
OK.

318
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,400
You told her you were me? Fuck.

319
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,800
Why do you have to rehearse
in the morning?

320
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,200
Alan likes morning rehearsals.

321
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,800
- Yeah? Well, that guy's a moron.
- Well, he speaks highly of you.

322
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Like I said, the guy's a genius.

323
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,000
- Come on. You know I can't be alone.
- You can.

324
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,600
You got bad breath.

325
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,000
Call me tonight.

326
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,200
You'll be asleep.

327
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,200
Wake me.

328
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,200
Shit.

329
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,000
- Did I scare you?
- No.

330
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,400
I'm sorry. Inspector Cray.

331
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,400
Martin Bells.

332
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,800
- You new here?
- Yeah.

333
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,600
- Law school?
- Yeah, yeah. Last semester, I hope.

334
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,800
That's fascinating for some reason.

335
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,800
It has something to it.

336
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,200
He's dead and he's going to die.

337
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,800
I think his name was Louis Paine,
if I'm not mistaken.

338
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,800
Sitting on death row, waiting.

339
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,600
We could really use one right now.

340
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,600
- A death row?
- No, a murder.

341
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,800
Wait a minute. There's been another?

342
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
They're bringing her in now.

343
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,000
- Have you been in there?
- No.

344
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,400
- You should have a look.
- Nah.

345
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,400
No, you should. Otherwise you'll just
be haunted here working at night.

346
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,000
Nothing cures a fantasy
like a quick dose of reality.

347
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,600
You think so?

348
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
Go on.

349
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,000
OK.

350
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,800
Are you all right?

351
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,600
It was just feet. Just feet.

352
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,200
Yeah.

353
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,400
I've been meaning to ask
what they do with them.

354
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,800
By the way, I saw you on TV.

355
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,200
Yeah? How was I?

356
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,400
- Are you on to him?
- We're getting closer.

357
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,200
How do you know
it's just the one guy?

358
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,600
- Can I trust you?
- Well, yeah, absolutely.

359
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,000
Can I trust you with
a bit of privileged information?

360
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
- Yeah.
- He has a signature.

361
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,400
- Signature?
- He takes their eyes.

362
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,200
- Good evening, guys.
- This one just quit smoking.

363
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,000
Deputy Inspector Bill Davies,
this is the new night watchman.

364
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,800
- What's your name again?
- Martin Bells.

365
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,200
Deputy Inspector Bill Davies.

366
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,600
Bill, Bells. Bells, Bill.

367
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,200
Most people,
when they see something like this,

368
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,800
their immediate reaction is to ask,
"How could somebody do this and why?"

369
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,400
Even when we catch the killer,
they want to know the how and why.

370
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,200
In movies or television, the killer
always explains the how or why.

371
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,200
He always has some reason, however
crazy. A mad gleam in his eye.

372
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,400
I've interrogated murderers
like this one before.

373
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Let me tell you, they are well beyond
the need to justify what they do.

374
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,000
They just do it.

375
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,200
Explanations are just a fiction
to make us feel safe.

376
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,000
Because if it can't be explained,
then it's just meaningless chaos.

377
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,000
It could touch any one of us
at any moment.

378
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,200
Which is exactly what it is.

379
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
I would have been sick.

380
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,600
I have a high tolerance
for that stuff.

381
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,400
I still think it's weird.

382
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,800
- Why?
- You don't think it's weird?

383
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,400
Why shouldn't I see the body?
I work there.

384
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,600
How do you know it's the same guy?

385
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,600
Some of us just know.

386
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
What is that supposed to mean?

387
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,600
Nothing. I'm sworn to secrecy.

388
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,600
- Come on.
- I can't tell you.

389
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,600
Wait a minute. You can't tell me?

390
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,600
Katherine, you wouldn't want to know.
Believe me.

391
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,000
Jerk.

392
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,200
- Duty nurse.
- This is night watchman from 03.

393
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,800
- The alarm just went off.
- The alarm?

394
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
The alarm from the morgue went off.

395
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,400
- What was that?
- The alarm from the morgue.

396
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,200
- Oh, well...
- Well?

397
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,400
You should just
go and check it, then.

398
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,400
The doctor will be there
in about 30 minutes.

399
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,000
What! But what if it...?

400
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,400
Just go down and check it out
and find the defect.

401
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,200
What if it's not a defect?

402
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,200
Don't worry. It is.

403
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,000
You crazy bastard! You're insane!
What the hell are you doing?

404
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,800
- Who do you think you are?
- I couldn't help it.

405
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,400
- I almost had a heart attack.
- But you didn't.

406
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,400
Christ, I almost shit myself!

407
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,400
How the hell did you get in here?

408
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,400
The front door doesn't close right
and you're buried in that book.

409
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,800
I stood and watched you
for five minutes!

410
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,200
You scared ten years off my life.

411
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,400
I called the duty doctor.
They're gonna think I've gone crazy.

412
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
You know, it's a really
beautiful place you got here.

413
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,800
It's cosy!

414
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,600
I talked to Joyce.
Remember, your name is James.

415
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
I can't handle
any more of your ideas.

416
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,400
All you have to do is show up.
I promise.

417
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,200
Dress nice.

418
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:05,600
Like I'm gonna tell Katherine
I'm dressing nice to study with you.

419
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,400
Tell her that we're studying opera.

420
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,400
Figaro. Figaro. Figaro.

421
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,200
You're a fucking nutcase!

422
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,400
That's Mr Fucking Nutcase
to you, pal!

423
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,800
Kje kej je

424
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,800
It was my fuckin' alarm clock.
I'm sorry. What a shock.

425
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,800
- Can I offer you something?
- Excuse me?

426
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,600
Have you ever spent any time
with the Zine family?

427
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,000
What?

428
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Thorazine, Stelazine, Compazine...

429
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,400
No!

430
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
They're really very nice.

431
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,400
They will make you sing hymns while
you watch a baby fall under a train.

432
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,800
No, thank you. I'm fine. Thanks.

433
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,800
Listen, we don't have time
for screwed-up kids.

434
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,400
Just don't freak out again.

435
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,600
OK?

436
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,200
Those'll kill you.

437
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,600
Thank you.

438
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,200
She's probably not coming.

439
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,400
Impatience is
an early indicator of boringness.

440
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,800
- "Boringness"? That's not a word.
- Here we go.

441
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,600
Joyce. Friend to the working man.
Good luck, James.

442
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,400
Oh, my God. Oh, Jesus.

443
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,400
- Hello.
- Hi.

444
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,400
- I'm Joyce.
- I'm James.

445
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:29,000
Good evening.
Allow me to congratulate you both.

446
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,000
- Congratulate us?
- On your engagement.

447
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,600
Why, thank you.

448
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,600
- Would you care to order now?
- Sure.

449
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,600
I didn't get a chance to...

450
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:47,000
I think we'll have the cod fish.

451
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,600
- Very good.
- I don't like fish.

452
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,000
Oh, of course.
Well, the filet mignon.

453
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,600
How would you like those?

454
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,400
- Medium.
- Rare.

455
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,600
- Rare.
- Of course. Thank you.

456
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,400
So, where do you come from?

457
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,000
Home.

458
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,600
Oh, no, I meant...

459
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,200
San Diego.

460
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,200
Wow, San Diego.

461
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,400
- How did you get here?
- Walked.

462
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,400
No, I meant from San Diego.

463
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,600
Drove.

464
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,000
- Do you like it here?
- It's OK.

465
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I was on my way to Nepal.

466
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,200
Nepal? Wow. What's in Nepal?

467
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,800
Monks.

468
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,600
Oh, right.

469
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,000
What are you doing?

470
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,400
Martin said
I had to do it right away.

471
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,200
Martin said.

472
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:07,800
You called?

473
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,600
No. Actually, we're fine.

474
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm sorry, sir, but I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

475
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,200
What?

476
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,000
Excuse me. Can I have a word, please?

477
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Just for a second.

478
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,800
You went too far this time, "Martin".

479
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,600
What do I... What do I owe you?

480
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,600
Fifty.

481
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,800
Cheers.

482
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,600
I don't drink. It makes me sick.

483
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,800
Really?

484
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,000
How much to drink a glass of whisky?

485
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,800
Twenty.

486
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,400
Twenty bucks? Yeah? OK.

487
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,000
Whoa, wait.
I didn't say how big it would be.

488
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,400
Bottoms up.

489
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,200
I guess you hear
that phrase quite a bit.

490
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,600
Joyce, you're dribbling.
That wasn't part of the deal.

491
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,200
All right.

492
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,200
I'll give you $100.

493
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,600
$100, if you can tell me
that you love me...

494
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,200
- I love you.
... and make me believe it.

495
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,800
- I love you.
- No, come on.

496
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,600
It's too fast. Didn't ring true.
I didn't believe it. Did you?

497
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,400
- I don't...
- OK, I'll add another 50.

498
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,800
That's all my allowance now.

499
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,800
It's all yours
if you can make it sound real.

500
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,000
- I love you.
- No. Come on.

501
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,400
- I love you.
- No, make me believe it.

502
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,400
- I...
- Make it sound real.

503
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,600
I love you.

504
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,400
No.

505
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,800
I didn't believe it. Sorry.

506
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,400
How you feeling, Joyce?

507
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,600
OK.

508
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,600
- Why do you take all this shit?
- What's it to you?

509
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,400
- Tell us about your customers.
- Why?

510
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:06,000
Tell us about your clients,
the weird ones. Tell us what they do.

511
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
- Why?
- Curiosity.

512
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,200
Answer the fucking question.

513
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,600
One dresses up like a baby
and makes me change his...

514
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,000
That's not weird enough.

515
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,600
- One guy makes me pee...
- Weirder.

516
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,600
One guy makes me pretend I'm dead.

517
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,600
Yes!

518
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,000
He covers me in a sheet and puts
a tag on my toe and then he...

519
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Then he what?

520
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,600
- Then he...
- Then he what?

521
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,400
Tell us what's wrong, Joyce.

522
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,000
My friend, Leanne,
brought the psycho home.

523
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,600
And?

524
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,200
And she...

525
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,200
They...

526
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,800
- I'd rather not.
- Tell us.

527
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,400
No. Please, can I go now?

528
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,600
Please, tell us.

529
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,000
They made me identify her body.

530
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,200
He took her eyes.

531
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,000
Could there be a relation between
the guy that makes you pretend...

532
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,800
What the hell do you care?

533
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,400
Can I go now?

534
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,000
You think you've met him?

535
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,200
Can I go now?

536
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,600
How was your evening?

537
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:09,200
OK, you know. Typical James.

538
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,600
- I don't know how Marie takes it.
- Me neither.

539
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,600
Who's Joyce?

540
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,600
Joyce?

541
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I don't know. Why?

542
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,000
She called late, asking for you.

543
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,000
For me?

544
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,600
Yes.

545
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,400
I don't know.
I don't know who that could be.

546
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,200
Did she say what it was about?

547
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:51,200
No.

548
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,600
- She leave a number?
- No.

549
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,000
I don't know.

550
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,000
Here's Johnny!

551
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,600
And the question still remains,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

552
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,200
what did the defendant know?

553
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,200
When did he know it?

554
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,200
And if he's so fucking smart...

555
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,400
- Hello.
- Have you been here?

556
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,600
- I can't hear you.
- Have you been here?

557
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,000
Come to think of it,
I'm not even home. Leave a message.

558
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,000
The boy who cried zombie.

559
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,000
Just you wait.

560
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,400
She's down there.

561
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,200
OK, which one was it?

562
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,800
Think you can still remember?

563
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,600
- It was the prostitute.
- Prostitute.

564
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,600
Well, good morning, Miss Singer.

565
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,200
This young man claims
that you've been up and about.

566
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,600
Well, isn't that strange?

567
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,600
She appears to be as dead
as a fucking doornail.

568
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,800
But I saw her there.
I saw her like I'm seeing you.

569
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,800
Hello? Miss Singer?
Hello! Is this thing on?

570
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,800
Still dead.

571
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,400
Listen. I saw...

572
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,600
- What's going on?
- Sorry, Inspector,

573
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,000
but I thought
I might need some backup.

574
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,000
- Did you have a problem?
- Yeah! I saw this...

575
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,600
His problem is he's under-medicated.

576
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,600
I saw her in the hallway.

577
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,400
I've gotten rid of people
for much less.

578
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,200
This is like one of those
movies on the USA Network.

579
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,200
- What do you mean?
- The hero sees something weird

580
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,400
and then no one will believe him.

581
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,600
You know, sometimes, Martin,

582
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:50,200
when you get overly tired,
the lines get a little blurry.

583
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,800
No, but I saw it.

584
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:57,400
- Now that guy thinks I'm crazy.
- No, no, no. Forget the doctor.

585
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:02,000
I think he has too much access to
the medicines he freely prescribes.

586
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
You saw what you saw.

587
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,200
Here, Martin.

588
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,600
You can always reach me here.

589
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,400
Oh, OK.

590
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,400
Try and take it easy.

591
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:22,000
- Don't go back.
- We need the money.

592
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
We can borrow from my mother.

593
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,600
We don't want your family's money.

594
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:33,400
By the time my father was 22,

595
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,400
he was married
to a woman he didn't love

596
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,400
and he was having an affair
with the woman he did.

597
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,200
And what does that mean to you?

598
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,600
That he was afraid.

599
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,800
- Of what?
- Of life.

600
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,400
- Yes.
- Will you marry me?

601
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,000
Yes.

602
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Shit, I hate that place.

603
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,600
Are you Katherine, Martin's...
Martin's girlfriend?

604
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,200
I can't... I know I'm supposed
to memorise it,

605
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,400
but I forget.

606
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,600
Maybe...

607
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,600
Maybe you could write it down for me.

608
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,200
You're not gonna give it to me
until I remember. I know.

609
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:09,600
If you write it down,
I'll remember. I swear.

610
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,400
- Are you Katherine?
- Yes.

611
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,400
- Martin's girlfriend?
- Yes.

612
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,600
Please make him stop it.

613
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,000
Won't you please make him stop?

614
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,000
- Hello?
- Hello.

615
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,200
- How was it?
- We finished early.

616
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,800
What was that?

617
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,200
Let's get one thing straight,
you shit. I'm not Marie!

618
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:12,600
If you wanna treat someone like James
treats Marie, find somebody else.

619
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,600
What are you talking about?

620
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,400
- I met your little slave girl today.
- Who?

621
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,600
Joyce.

622
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Yeah, go ahead, tell me
she's some little lying junkie whore

623
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
who makes up stories. Go on!

624
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,000
Look, I... I...

625
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,400
- Do you want me to play dead?
- What?

626
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,000
- You screwed her, didn't you?
- No!

627
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,200
No, it was just a game, I swear!

628
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,400
What did she say?

629
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,600
Do you want me to play dead?

630
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:50,200
Is that what turns you on?

631
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,200
What?

632
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,400
- Is that how you like it?
- No, Katherine.

633
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,800
Katherine, what...?

634
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,600
- What are...?
- Did you enjoy it?

635
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,400
Shit.

636
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,200
What?

637
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,600
Did you enjoy it?

638
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,600
- Excuse me?
- Did you enjoy it?

639
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,400
- Hello, Martin.
- Hi.

640
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,000
How are you?

641
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,000
I don't know.

642
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,600
Tell me, Martin,
you did your rounds last night?

643
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,800
Of course. Why?

644
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,200
Come with me.

645
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,000
What can you tell me about that?

646
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I don't know.

647
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,200
- Paul.
- I see a dead girl

648
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:57,400
turned over on her stomach
with her legs spread apart,

649
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,400
as though she's been
sexually assaulted.

650
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,400
The doctor tells me you're
the only one that's been in here.

651
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,800
Cray. You might want
to have a look at this.

652
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:37,000
Martin, what can you tell me
about the drops of semen over there?

653
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,400
Someone's trying to frame me.

654
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:41,800
I'm as confused as you are,

655
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,800
but the murder victim's
played tricks twice now

656
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
and you've been involved both times.

657
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:50,000
- Do you have any enemies?
- Not that I know of.

658
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,600
Debts? Old grudges?
Angry drug dealers? Anything?

659
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,000
Wait a minute. There was someone.

660
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,200
This hooker, Joyce.

661
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,000
I went with her.

662
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:02,800
I see.

663
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
The girl down there was her friend.

664
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,800
She identified the body.
The police must know her.

665
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,800
- Young girl. Redhead, skinny.
- Yeah, right.

666
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,800
I remember interviewing her.

667
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,200
What happened?

668
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,600
First, she called my house one night.

669
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,600
Then she met my girlfriend and
said I'd done stuff that I never did.

670
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:23,200
Why would she do that?

671
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,800
- How did you meet her?
- Through a friend. It was a joke.

672
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,800
Friend? Which friend?

673
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,400
Just some guy, James.
It was supposed to be a joke.

674
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,600
So many things are.
What's your friend's full name?

675
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:41,200
James Christian Galman.

676
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,600
- Martin.
- Yeah?

677
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,600
If all this is what I think it is...

678
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
there's someone very dangerous
standing right behind you in the dark

679
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,000
breathing down your neck.

680
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,800
And maybe you've unwittingly
become his link to Joyce.

681
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,800
What do you mean, "his link"?

682
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,200
I think the murderer
wants the murder to be exposed.

683
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,800
- I still don't get it.
- Well, I think he wants to stop.

684
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,800
I think he's tired of killing.

685
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,800
Wants to be free.

686
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,000
But he won't be free
as long as we're looking for him.

687
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,600
And how long
will we continue looking for him?

688
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,800
Till we catch the killer.

689
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:34,800
So what's the solution
to his dilemma?

690
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,600
Get somebody else caught
in his place.

691
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,200
He chooses a new victim...

692
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:48,000
and then he makes someone else
look guilty when he kills her.

693
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,800
He's already gained Joyce's trust.

694
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,600
Now all he needs to do
is find her killer.

695
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:06,800
Her killer?

696
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,200
No, this is too absurd.

697
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:18,000
Why does Joyce suddenly call you?
Why does she go see your girlfriend?

698
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,200
Think about what's happened here.

699
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:24,400
Think about that doctor that looks
at you without doubt in his mind.

700
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,000
Even Deputy Inspector Bill
suspects you.

701
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,200
No, you can't be serious.

702
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:35,600
Don't worry, Martin.
I know it's not you.

703
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,800
It has to be someone
that knows his way around here.

704
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,600
So, what about
the old night watchman?

705
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,400
Yes, I'll look into it.

706
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,800
- What about the semen in the morgue?
- What about it?

707
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,200
Yes, well,
the lab is gonna analyse it,

708
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,400
but in the meantime,
can we have a sample from you?

709
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,800
Martin, it's Joyce.

710
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,800
I need to see you. It's important.

711
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,600
There are some things I need to tell
you that I couldn't tell you before.

712
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:25,400
I need to see you in person,
tonight at eight.

713
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,200
Excuse me?

714
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:34,200
My address is 9248 Second Street,
number 322.

715
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,600
Fuck this!

716
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,200
He wasn't at home.
It was the answering machine.

717
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:02,200
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

718
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,800
What's the matter with you?

719
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,800
What are you doing with Joyce?

720
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,800
- What?
- The police can't find the murderer.

721
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Someone raped one of the victims.

722
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,200
- Someone threatened Joyce.
- Shit.

723
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,800
- So, they know who it is?
- They have a suspect.

724
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,600
- Who is it?
- The wrong guy, I guess.

725
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,600
I guess they got the wrong guy.

726
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,400
You wanna narrow that down
a little bit? Which wrong guy?

727
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,000
- It's me.
- You?

728
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,200
They think it's you?

729
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,400
Oh, boy!

730
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,400
Boy, they got the wrong guy.

731
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:09,200
I'll ask you this once and then I'll
walk away and forget all about it.

732
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,200
OK.

733
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,000
Is it you?

734
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:35,800
Martin!

735
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,600
Oh, come on. Martin!

736
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,400
It makes me sick
when I think of the scum out there.

737
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,400
God gave him over...

738
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:50,000
in the sinful desires of
their hearts, to sexual impurity...

739
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,600
Do you know...

740
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,000
Do you know where the Himalayas are?

741
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:31,000
I have always wanted
to go to the Himalayas.

742
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,200
I've always wanted to go there.

743
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I've always wanted
to go to the Himalayas.

744
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:55,800
Hello?

745
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,400
Hello?

746
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,200
Hello?

747
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:39,400
Martin, it's Joyce.
I need to see you.

748
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,600
It's important.

749
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:46,000
There are some things I need to tell
you that I couldn't tell you before.

750
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:50,800
I need to see you in person,
tonight at eight.

751
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:57,400
My address is 9248 Second Street,
number 322.

752
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,600
Damn, what if you wouldn't
have gotten out of there?

753
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,000
Can you imagine what he would...

754
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:30,200
Katherine,
we have to call the police.

755
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,000
We can't let her just lie there.

756
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,800
They found her.

757
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:39,600
A young girl was found dead tonight,
the third in as many weeks.

758
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:43,200
We have all the evidence we need.
We'll have closure soon.

759
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,200
I'd like to talk to the duty doctor.

760
01:13:51,400 --> 01:13:53,000
One moment.

761
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:56,600
- Hello?
- Yeah, hello. This is Martin Bells.

762
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:59,800
You know, the screwed-up kid
from Forensics.

763
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,600
- Joyce asked me to say hello.
- Who?

764
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,200
Joyce. Your playmate.

765
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:10,600
Listen. I have personally asked
for your removal. Go home.

766
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,200
Well, I thought
you'd want me to stay.

767
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,400
Go and see a psychiatrist.

768
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,200
Do you think I'm a psychopath?

769
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,000
You wouldn't be
the first night watchman who was.

770
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,600
The first.

771
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:34,200
The first.

772
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,400
Deputy Inspector Bill Davies,
I'd like to speak to Martin Bells.

773
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,400
- He's not here.
- We don't know where he is.

774
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,600
- Hello.
- Yeah, hi. It's me.

775
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:49,400
Joyce has been murdered. The cops
are here looking for you right now.

776
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,800
- I'm going over.
- It's too dangerous.

777
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:53,200
He didn't do it!

778
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:56,000
Keep your ears open.
I'm gonna try something.

779
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,200
- Martin is not a murderer.
- We don't make up evidence.

780
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:03,000
He's a suspect because weird things
happened at work?

781
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:07,400
Listen. She exposed him herself.

782
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,800
- She wrote his name.
- What did she write?

783
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,000
- His name.
- Yeah, but what name?

784
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:18,400
Martin.

785
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,800
We changed the names.
Joyce thought he was James

786
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,200
so she would have written James.

787
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:30,200
- That makes you our prime suspect.
- This is ridiculous.

788
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:34,200
- There was no name.
- What?

789
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,200
Katherine was there.

790
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,400
You were there? When?

791
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:43,400
There was a lot of blood.
But there was no name.

792
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:47,600
And the murderer...

793
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:49,600
was still there.

794
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,600
- What?
- Katherine.

795
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,400
Hello.

796
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,400
Yeah, hello? This is Martin Bells.

797
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,800
The new... new night watchman.
You showed me around here.

798
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,800
You know what time it is?

799
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:16,600
Inspector Cray, please. Well,
where'd he go? The hospital? Alone?

800
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,800
You told me the story about
the guy who did it with... you know.

801
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,600
- When was it?
- The guy with the corpses?

802
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,600
- Yeah.
- Before I started, late '60s.

803
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,000
- Do you remember his name?
- No.

804
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,800
- And what happened to him?
- Nothing.

805
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,200
- What?
- The embarrassment.

806
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,400
The hospital couldn't press charges.

807
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:42,400
No. I guess
he's out there somewhere.

808
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,000
Where is she?

809
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:37,400
Cray.

810
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,200
Hello?

811
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,200
Martin, it's Inspector Cray.

812
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,000
We have a situation here.

813
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Joyce has been murdered.

814
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,200
We have to talk.

815
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,400
Well, I'll come down to the station.

816
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,400
We really have to get
to the bottom of this.

817
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,200
I think it might be better
if I pick you up.

818
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,200
Martin?

819
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:33,800
- Are you still there?
- I'd prefer to come to the station.

820
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,400
I'll come and get you.

821
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:42,600
Tell me, Martin. Are you still
gonna maintain your innocence?

822
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,200
Yeah.

823
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:47,400
Who else could it be, Martin?

824
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:51,400
The killing has to stop, Martin.
Don't you want it to stop?

825
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,400
Maybe I could talk
to Deputy Inspector Bill.

826
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:58,200
Why wouldn't you want to talk to me?

827
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,600
You're under arrest, Martin.

828
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,800
Would you please put this
on your desk?

829
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:35,200
We have all the time in the world
to wait for your confession, Martin.

830
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,200
All the time in the world.

831
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,800
I want you to do me a favour, Martin.

832
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:55,800
- Hit me.
- What?

833
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:57,200
Come on, hit me.

834
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,400
How much more can you take?

835
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,000
Do you know what they'll do to you?

836
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,600
They'll snuff you out
like a bug hitting a windshield.

837
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,000
You're going to die anyway, Martin.

838
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,400
Don't you know
that you're going to die?

839
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,000
Come on, Martin.
You've got to do something.

840
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Protect yourself. Save yourself.
This is your last chance!

841
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,600
Do something...

842
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,800
or I'll take your girlfriend's eyes.

843
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,800
Martin?

844
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:58,000
He's gone mad! Get in the hall!
Get in the hall!

845
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
No!

846
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,600
Katherine!

847
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,200
I shouldn't be telling you this,

848
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,600
but she wrote his name
before she died.

849
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:19,200
I know.
Deputy Inspector Bill told me.

850
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:21,600
Deputy Inspector Bill told you?

851
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,800
That's highly unorthodox.

852
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,600
I'm very glad you told me this.

853
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
This changes everything.

854
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,400
All right, let's go through
this one more time.

855
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,600
Why didn't you call
from Joyce's apartment?

856
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,600
Because the murderer was still there.

857
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,600
The murderer was still there?

858
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:13,600
She was already dead.

859
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:17,600
- She was already dead?
- She hadn't written anything, so...

860
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,800
- Yes?
- Someone else must have written it.

861
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,600
Trying to frame Martin, right?

862
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,600
Trying to frame Martin? Yes.

863
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:33,200
Where are we?

864
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:42,600
Interesting theory.

865
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,400
What do we do now?

866
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,800
Martin, I'm waiting.

867
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,800
Hey, I was worried about you.

868
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,600
- He hit me and escaped.
- Something's wrong.

869
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:25,400
Nothing's wrong. Who's this?

870
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,600
James.

871
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
- Where's Katherine?
- How should I know?

872
01:24:34,200 --> 01:24:37,200
Her bike's outside,
she must be in here somewhere.

873
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:40,000
She's not in here. He, uh...

874
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,800
He probably took her with him.

875
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Martin!

876
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,800
Help!

877
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,400
Help us!

878
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:25,200
Take him to the station. I'll take
a look at Joyce. I'll meet you there.

879
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,800
- Wait, why would they try to escape?
- Take it easy.

880
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,400
Handcuff him.

881
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:43,600
What?

882
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,600
You're under arrest
for suspicion of murder.

883
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:55,800
This is bullshit.

884
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,800
You have doubts too. Tell him!

885
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Doubts?

886
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,400
Doubts about what,
Deputy Inspector Bill?

887
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,000
Nothing.

888
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:25,400
I don't like it when you keep things
from me, Deputy Inspector Bill.

889
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:32,600
I've always encouraged you
to have your own ideas, haven't I?

890
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:37,800
- Yeah. It's nothing. He's babbling.
- You said something was wrong.

891
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,000
Well, something is definitely wrong.
Take him away.

892
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:17,600
Have you ever been killed before?

893
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I'll be back in a minute.

894
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,600
No. No. No.

895
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,600
This just doesn't happen.
It's not happening.

896
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:15,400
Cray, why are you doing this?

897
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,400
What the hell are you doing?

898
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,800
Stop asking for the how and why,
Martin.

899
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
Does it hurt?

900
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,000
Let's grow old together.

901
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,400
Yeah.

902
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,600
Let's get older.

903
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,000
There's a challenge.

904
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:35,400
James, we're gonna take a little ride
now, all right? Keep that up.

905
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,200


906
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,200
Can you walk?
