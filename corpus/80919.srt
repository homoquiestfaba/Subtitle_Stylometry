I asked if he wanted to play guitar on
the music night here in the pub.

357
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,595
He just laughed at me.

- Oh!

500
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,233
So we could have you arrested
for not arresting us.

501
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,471
- Don't start.
- Nobody will ever know.

502
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,438
<i>- Why did you do this?
- [Mary] What's that, then?</i>

503
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,909
You know.
Dress up with the...

504
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,275

out of the hospital.

505

<i>You are valued as
part of our community.</i>

506
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,996
- Yeah, right.
- So don't go killing yourself again.

507
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:17,232
- Mmm! Apart from anything else,
it's against the law.
- It's illegal, see?

508
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,118
No, I won't.

509
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,078
Too many interesting
things happenin'.

510
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,230
Maybe later.

511
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,595
<i>Give me another whisky.</i>

512
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,237
What the hell is going on?

513
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,437
Shush, shush, shush, shush, shush, shush.
You'll wake Vince.

If he doesn't get his nap,
he goes mental.

516
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,829
Never mind about that.
You can't light a fire in my driveway!

517
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,434
Well, you can't eat raw chicken.

518
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,796
It's only a little fire.
I'll make sure they clean it up.

519
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,914
I thought you were off playing
a gig in Uttoxeter tonight.

520
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,431
It was cancelled.
They put in a new karaoke machine.

521
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,831
Humph.

522
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,677
How did it feel...

523
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,876
meeting your dad
for the first time?

524
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,356
I didn't really feel anything.
No real connection.

525
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,556
I don't suppose we've got
a lot in common.

526
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,632
- Music.
- We didn't talk about music.

527
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,631
I was in there for five minutes.

528
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,029
You don't have to talk.

529
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:58,797
If you want to know what
a musician's about, listen to him play.

530
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,553
If you want to know
about your dad...

531
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,835
listen to his music.

532
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,308
What if I want him
to know about me?

533
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:15,837

Can I ask you a question?

All right.

565
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,548
What was it like,
that night with my father?

566
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,119
We met after the show.

567
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,395
We were both so young.

568
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,869
It was before he got
really, really famous...

569
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,916
<i>and got into drugs
and everything.</i>

570
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,275
<i>What'd you talk about?</i>

571
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,510
<i>Music mostly.</i>

572
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,796
<i>I remember he was impressed
when I said I liked The Four Tops.</i>

573
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:42,917
<i>Most people my age back then
were into Kajagoogoo.</i>

574
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,719
<i>[Olivia]
So you just went back to his hotel and...</i>

00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,791
<i>[Rebecca]
No, I'm telling you, it wasn't like that.</i>

576
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,189
<i>I wasn't like that.</i>

577
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,992
<i>We snuck out away from all
the other band members and roadies.</i>

578
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,913
<i>Went to Jack Williams'
fish and chip shop.</i>

579
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,991
<i>God, it's not
even there any more.</i>

580
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:10,518
<i>Eventually, after we watched
the sun coming up...</i>

581
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,438
we went back to his hotel
and had breakfast.

582
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,157
And that's when it happened?

583
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,431
Yes.

584
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:30,274
<i>- It was just a one-night stand?
- Well...</i>

585
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,909
No, um, he had a few days off.

586
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,199
So we holed up in his hotel
and ordered room service for 48 hours.

587
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,078
I told your gran I'd gone to London
to apply for college.

Mum, you tramp!

00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,631
Don't get any ideas.
It was a stupid thing to do.

Do you still love him?

591
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,072
Don't be ridiculous. Can't love someone
unless you know them.

592
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,879
We were just kids.
It seems like a million years ago...

593
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,679
- like it happened
to someone else, not me.
- That sounds like a cop-out.

594
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,671
Hey, I didn't cop out.
He did.

595
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,876
That's the type of person he is.

596
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,076
I didn't say
you weren't angry at him.

597
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,594
I said you still loved him.

598
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,758
You're a romantic, Olivia.

599
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,479

00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,037
<i>Well, after the band split up, I did

Go on.

00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,593
Funny looking what's-it.
Friendly, though.

606
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,796
- It's a llama.
- What's his name?

607
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,189
Dolly.

608
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,191
Dolly Llama.

609
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,751
It's a prestige item.

Why Loch Ness?

614
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,911
I like it. It's quiet.

615
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,070
<i>You don't like quiet.
You're a drummer.</i>

616
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,789
You like big, noisy stages,
shrill women and loud pubs.

617
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,632
You're Australian, for God's sake.

618
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,917
All of that is true, mate, but I got
a bit tired of it. You know what I mean?

619
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,309
Being a rock star is all right
for a man in his 20s and 30s...

620
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,075
but I'm 43 years old.

621
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,549
I'd feel faintly ridiculous
being part of that world now.

622
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,875
Never thought I'd see the day.

623
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,350
Well, all right,
then why'd you move down here?

624
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,637
What's the best gig
we ever played?

625
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,234

New York, 1989.

626
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,675
No, no.
Apart from that.

627
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,194
Ooh.

bike ride from here.
- Yeah.</i>

630
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,159
So what? You're not gonna
play there again, are you?

631
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,516
Yeah. I don't even think
it's there any more.

632
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,388
I've always liked this place. I like this
part of the world, and I like it here.

633
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,550
I get peace to write music.

634
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,676
Peace to isolate, more like.
Nobody to bug you...

635
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,433
as you slowly
drink yourself to death.

636
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,353
Absolutely right, my good
Australian friend. Cheers.

637
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,752
I don't touch it any more, mate.
Been sober eight years.

Oh, no.

Yeah. I'm A.A. All right, mate.

643
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,710
Don't have much to do
with Jesus, as a rule.

644
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,837
You haven't come here to convert me
to some born-again cult, have you?

645
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:34,356
You believe what you like, mate.
I'm here to help you get off the booze.

646

<i>- I don't wanna get off the booze.
- 'Course you do.</i>

647
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,116
That's why you drove your bike
through a window.

648
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,509
Oh, and by the way...

649
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:48,278
I oughta kick your ass for
killing an innocent motorcycle.

650
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,710
All right, look.

651
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,598
I'm not stoppin'.
I'm havin' one later, okay?

652
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,189
That's the ticket.
One day at a time.

653
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,589

00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,076
Does anyone want to accept
a chip for 30 days sober?

689
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,516
You're showin' your age, mate.
Maybe it's time you started knittin'.

690
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,319
Yeah? Well, maybe it's time
you started the amends process, mate.

691
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,119
Hey, I got her pregnant and left her
to raise the kid on her own.

692
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,192
How do you make amends
for that, eh?

693
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,875
<i>I don't know. A nice bunch of flowers,
box of chocolates.</i>

694
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,918
A nice bunch of flowers and a box
of chocolates. What a fantastic idea!

695
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,470
Why didn't I think of that, eh?
Problem solved.
