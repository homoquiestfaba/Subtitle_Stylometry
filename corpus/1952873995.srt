00:00:09,947 --> 00:00:12,382
[people chattering]

4
00:00:15,153 --> 00:00:17,421
Hi.
[Woman] See you in Genetics?

5
00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:23,760
[Woman]
Thanks for lunch.

6
00:00:23,828 --> 00:00:25,557
I'm really glad you guys
got to see the new clinic.

7
00:00:25,582 --> 00:00:26,663
Are you kidding?

8
00:00:26,664 --> 00:00:28,899
Think we'd come to Boston
and not see our girl?

9
00:00:28,966 --> 00:00:31,868
We're so proud of you.

10
00:00:31,936 --> 00:00:34,184
Hey, Phil, I need your help
on my cadaver.

11
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:34,538
Okay.

12
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:37,107
I've been trying, like, for six hours
to find the posterior thoracic nerve,

13
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:39,976
and if I don't dig it up soon,
Lenhoff is gonna cut me open.

14
00:00:40,044 --> 00:00:42,546
Yeah, I know.
Posterior thoracic is a bitch.

15
00:00:42,613 --> 00:00:43,980
Um, I need-- I need--
Janet.

16
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:45,982
Janet, love, we need you.
Come here.

17
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,984
Why don't I like
the sound of that?

18
00:00:48,052 --> 00:00:49,920
It's all in the interest
of science, dear.

19
00:00:49,987 --> 00:00:50,987
Trust me?
Sure.

20
00:00:51,055 --> 00:00:52,589
Put your left hand up.

21
00:00:52,657 --> 00:00:54,291
Tom, pay attention.

22
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,293
You just dig behind--
Sorry my hands are cold.

23
00:00:56,361 --> 00:00:58,695
Dig behind
the scalenus medius,

24
00:00:58,763 --> 00:01:00,864
then you move aside
the brachial plexus,

25
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:04,468
and then slide down
to the serratus anterior.

26
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:07,270
And there you have it--
posterior thoracic.

27
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:09,973
You finished, Philip?
Yes.

28
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:11,708
I thank

29
00:01:11,776 --> 00:01:13,810
Science thanks you.
Tom here thanks you.

30
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:15,278
I thank you.

31
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:16,880
I gotta go. Study, okay?

32
00:01:16,948 --> 00:01:19,082
[Tom]
Sure.

33
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:21,952
Any thoughts on why

34
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:23,587
we're seeing
shortness of breath,

35
00:01:23,654 --> 00:01:25,722
lethargy and dizziness
in a 7-year-old?

36
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,125
Eisenmenger's syndrome.

37
00:01:28,192 --> 00:01:30,026
I mean, that would go with
the pulmonary hypertension.

38
00:01:30,094 --> 00:01:32,362
[Doctor] That's a bit of a leap,
Mr. Markoff.

39
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,732
But assuming your hypothesis
is correct,

40
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,401
why are we seeing
the low heart rate,

41
00:01:37,468 --> 00:01:40,404
and diminished reflex,
and a lack of affect?

42
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:43,907
Perhaps the fact that a
7-year-old boy is alone

43
00:01:43,975 --> 00:01:47,043
and his parents wouldn't bother to be
with him when he's in the hospital.

44
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:49,880
Hmm. Personalizing, Philip?

45
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:51,481
No, sir.

46
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:53,817
Here you are, baby.
I had to go all the way

47
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:56,820
to the CVS on Commonwealth
to get you the cherry kind.

48
00:01:56,888 --> 00:01:59,923
It'll be right here waiting
for you when you wake up.

49
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:01,992
Ah. There's a lesson
for you all.

50
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:04,094
Things are not always
what they appear to be,

51
00:02:04,162 --> 00:02:06,797
and even
the remarkable Mr. Markoff

52
00:02:06,864 --> 00:02:08,665
isn't perfect.

53
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:09,933
[laughter]

54
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:12,369
All right, guys.
Next patient.

55
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:16,640
I only torture you,

56
00:02:16,707 --> 00:02:18,942
because when
every major hospital

57
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,179
comes clamoring for you to
do your residency with them,

58
00:02:22,246 --> 00:02:25,248
I want you to realize
that this place

59
00:02:25,316 --> 00:02:26,850
recognizes your talent

60
00:02:26,918 --> 00:02:29,286
and is gonna push you
to be even better.

61
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:32,789
Also, I-- Well, I kind
of like torturing you.

62
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:34,291
[chuckles]

63
00:02:37,128 --> 00:02:38,695
Oh.
Sorry.

64
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:49,806
Don't turn around.

65
00:02:49,874 --> 00:02:53,677
Uh, what part of "Don't turn"
didn't you understand?
Oh, sorry.

66
00:02:53,744 --> 00:02:57,981
Um, he is locked in.

67
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:00,617
Um, I think he's
looking at you.

68
00:03:00,685 --> 00:03:04,087
Uh, no. He is definitely
looking at you.

69
00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:08,258
[chuckles]
I don't think so.

70
00:03:08,326 --> 00:03:09,559
Damn.

71
00:03:09,627 --> 00:03:11,361
He could not get cuter

72
00:03:11,429 --> 00:03:13,597
if he was holding
a teddy bear and a puppy.

73
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:19,636
[Doctor
Mr. Markoff?

74
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:22,038
Yes?
We need your genius.

75
00:03:22,106 --> 00:03:24,841
He li-i-ikes you.

76
00:03:24,909 --> 00:03:26,009
[laughs]

77
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:29,679
[muttering]

78
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:35,752
Butene...

79
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,154
[mutters]

80
00:03:38,222 --> 00:03:40,657
[sighs]
Cyclooctene...

81
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:41,791
Antiaromatic.

82
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:43,593
Ah, aromatics are tough.

83
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:46,196
Yeah.

84
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:47,264
[chuckles]

85
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:49,633
Um, I can never figure out

86
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,768
which electrons to put where.

87
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:54,905
You wanna know a trick?
Don't memorize, diagram.

88
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:57,807
I'm Philip, by the way.
Markoff.

89
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:00,176
We actually--
We met the other day for a second.

90
00:04:00,244 --> 00:04:02,712
Well, we didn't really meet.
We just kind of bumped.

91
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,780
Yeah.

92
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:07,817
Um, I'm Megan...McAllister.

93
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:09,719
So that's cool.

94
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:12,355
You're-- You're helping out
at the clinic.

95
00:04:12,423 --> 00:04:16,793
Yeah. And you're, uh,
going to med school.

96
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:18,728
That I am.

97
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:20,730
That's cool, too.

98
00:04:23,434 --> 00:04:25,068
Yeah, I should really be going,
'cause I have to study.

99
00:04:25,136 --> 00:04:27,337
I have this huge test
in 17 hours.

100
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:29,906
Whoa. You've got a test
tomorrow, and you are studying?

101
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:32,175
Yeah.
That's what people do.

102
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:33,777
No, not me.

103
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:36,212
[laughs]
Um,

104
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,548
okay, so what do you think
should be doing?

105
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:41,184
I think you should be cutting
loose, airing out your brain.

106
00:04:41,252 --> 00:04:42,719
Right. Right.

107
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:44,688
So, when I fail
the test tomorrow,

108
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:47,424
can I write that theory in
at the essay portion

109
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:49,159
of my medical school
applications?

110
00:04:50,761 --> 00:04:52,162
Uh, so you're--

111
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:53,663
Where-- Where you applying?

112
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:55,865
Here, he asks hopefully?

113
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:56,967
Hmm?

114
00:04:58,436 --> 00:05:00,637
Um, probably Brent.

115
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:03,406
I probably won't get in.
Um...

116
00:05:03,474 --> 00:05:05,809
They really would be
lucky to have you.

117
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:09,679
You don't even know me.
Oh, my God. That's true.

118
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:11,848
Wow. Okay. Come on.
I'll quiz you on the way.

119
00:05:11,916 --> 00:05:13,984
On the way where?
729. I got your page number.

120
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:16,286
On the way to the place I always
go the night before an exam.

121
00:05:16,354 --> 00:05:18,688
Uh, you know what?
I really have to study,

122
00:05:18,756 --> 00:05:20,991
and I'm--
I'm not that, you know,

123
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:23,927
"run away with a guy I've only known
for 30 seconds" type of girl, so...

124
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:25,996
Okay.
[clears throat]

125
00:05:26,063 --> 00:05:28,331
Um, okay.

126
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,467
SUNY Albany,
<i>summa cum laude.</i>

127
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:32,168
Uh, B.U. med school,

128
00:05:32,236 --> 00:05:34,437
second year,
top 5% of my class.

129
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:37,540
Not bragging.
I love animals. I don't like birds, though.

130
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:40,010
I am an unapologetic member
of the Young Republicans,

131
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:42,212
but I also don't really
like to talk politics.

132
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,980
Uh, sometimes
I work too hard.

133
00:05:44,048 --> 00:05:45,548
And when I was little,

134
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:47,584
I really hated wearing
full-length pants.

135
00:05:47,652 --> 00:05:49,619
Strange. I know.
[laughs]

136
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:51,354
And, um,

137
00:05:51,422 --> 00:05:53,990
in case you haven't noticed,
I really like you.

138
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,262
So I'll pick you up
at 8:00?

139
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,632
I, um--
I have to change.

140
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,669
Don't do that. Never do that.
I like you just the way you are.

141
00:06:05,736 --> 00:06:07,370
I meant my clothes.

142
00:06:07,438 --> 00:06:09,205
Right. Clothes.

143
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:11,074
All right. I'll pick
you up at 7:30, then.

144
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,344
Okay.

145
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:16,146
All right.

146
00:06:29,293 --> 00:06:31,227
Okay.
So the trick to roulette,

147
00:06:31,295 --> 00:06:34,330
or at least my theory is
you gotta feel the numbers.

148
00:06:34,398 --> 00:06:37,701
You've gotta really, really kind
of get in sync with the wheel.

149
00:06:37,768 --> 00:06:39,402
Are you hearing yourself
right now?

150
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,072
Yeah, it works. Watch.
Here. I'll show you.

151
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:45,408
Final bets, please.
Place your bets.

152
00:06:45,476 --> 00:06:47,077
Is this you hearing
or feeling the number?

153
00:06:47,144 --> 00:06:48,645
Mm-hmm.
[laughing]

154
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:51,081
Last chance, people.
I got it.

155
00:06:51,148 --> 00:06:52,482
Black 22.

156
00:06:53,484 --> 00:06:55,218
Oh!
Oh.

157
00:06:55,286 --> 00:06:57,754
Red 12.
I don't think that theory works.

158
00:06:57,822 --> 00:07:00,123
Or maybe someone was distracting me.
Oh, so now it's my fault?

159
00:07:00,191 --> 00:07:02,225
Yes, of course, it was your fault.
Fine. Blame it on me.

160
00:07:02,293 --> 00:07:03,760
You're a bad person.
[laughing]

161
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:04,928
Your drinks, sir.
Oh.

162
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:06,529
Thank you.

163
00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:08,298
Oh, my gosh.
That's a very pink drink.

164
00:07:08,365 --> 00:07:10,700
I have to be good.
It's a school night.

165
00:07:10,768 --> 00:07:12,836
All right.
Trust me, though.

166
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:14,771
The rush is gonna
be good for you,

167
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,406
and it releases
the endorphins,

168
00:07:16,474 --> 00:07:18,408
gets your brain working.

169
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:20,443
Cyclopropene.

170
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:22,946
Um, aromatic?

171
00:07:23,013 --> 00:07:25,348
There you go.
All right. Here we go.

172
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:27,350
See? You know this stuff.
You just gotta trust yourself.

173
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:28,885
Okay.
Oh, okay.

174
00:07:28,953 --> 00:07:30,220
Take these.

we're just great
for each other.

351
00:15:13,784 --> 00:15:16,552
[Laughs]
He'll still charge you.

352
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,221
That's exactly right--
by the hour.

353
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:21,691
Megan, you managed
to find a young man

354
00:15:21,758 --> 00:15:25,428
capable of crushing it
300 yards off the tee

355
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:27,296
and keeping it in
the middle of the fairway.

356
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:29,365
[overlapping chatter]

357
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:30,866
Okay.
Okay.

358
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:32,401
Bye, baby.

359
00:15:32,469 --> 00:15:34,737
Love you, too.
Nice meeting you guys.

360
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:36,706
Drive safely.
Okay.

361
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:41,877
[laughs]

362
00:15:41,945 --> 00:15:44,547
I told you.
I told you, Pocket.

363
00:15:44,615 --> 00:15:46,582
It's gonna be happily
ever after for you and me.

364
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,184
It's amazing.

365
00:15:48,252 --> 00:15:50,319
[indistinct]
Ha ha!

366
00:15:50,387 --> 00:15:52,755
Okay, so...
Huh?

367
00:15:52,823 --> 00:15:54,957
Ask me again.
What?!

368
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:56,692
Come on, please
ask me again.

369
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,263
All right.
[clears throat]

370
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,499
Megan McAllister, I love
you with all my heart.

371
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:04,700
Yes!
Will you marry--

372
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:06,769
[laughter]

373
00:16:06,837 --> 00:16:08,304
Yes, yes.
Okay.

374
00:16:08,372 --> 00:16:10,006
Mmm.

375
00:17:36,426 --> 00:17:38,561
That was fast.

376
00:17:38,628 --> 00:17:40,696
Well, I couldn't wait
to meet you.

377
00:17:40,764 --> 00:17:42,698
Mmm, charmer.

378
00:17:42,766 --> 00:17:44,533
I like that.

379
00:17:56,652 --> 00:17:58,920
[Photographer]
Oh, it's great. Big smile.

380
00:17:58,988 --> 00:18:01,156
Is my tie okay?
Yeah.

381
00:18:01,223 --> 00:18:03,258
[laughing]
Some of this?

382
00:18:03,325 --> 00:18:05,160
Can you remind me why--
what this is for again?

383
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:06,694
It's for the web site.

384
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:08,163
We have a web site?

385
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,031
It's going to be
a pink web site.

386
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:11,433
Yes.

387
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,935
[Photographer]
Smiling.

388
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:15,437
What happened?
[laughs]

389
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:17,338
Oh! You look like
Ken and Barbie.

390
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:19,007
Did he say Ken and Barbie?
Yeah.

391
00:18:19,074 --> 00:18:21,276
Is he making fun of us?
No, it's cute.

392
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:24,679
[Photographer]
Hey, great.

393
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:26,548
You're a beautiful couple.

394
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:29,284
You're a beautiful couple.

395
00:18:39,862 --> 00:18:42,030
[Megan] This is going
to be the wedding web site

396
00:18:42,097 --> 00:18:43,898
to end all
wedding web sites.

397
00:18:43,966 --> 00:18:46,901
Babe, this is
looking so cute!

398
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:49,170
Hey, oh,
are you busy?

399
00:18:49,238 --> 00:18:52,140
No, I'm not busy at all.
I'm just looking at genetic notes.

400
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:54,576
But go ahead. Tell me
about this web site.

401
00:18:54,643 --> 00:18:57,645
Well, it's going to be where we're
registered and everything, obviously.

402
00:18:57,713 --> 00:18:59,347
But then there's going
to be pictures

403
00:18:59,415 --> 00:19:01,216
and there's ing
to be a countdown.

404
00:19:01,283 --> 00:19:03,017
It's like a rocket launch.

405
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:04,686
There's gonna be a quiz
for all our friends to take

406
00:19:04,753 --> 00:19:06,488
to see how well
they know us.

407
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:07,956
Doesn't really matter
how well other people know us.

408
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:09,958
It's about how well
we know each other.

409
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,826
God, I like you.

410
00:19:11,894 --> 00:19:13,561
I like you, too.
We should get married.

411
00:19:13,629 --> 00:19:16,164
Ha ha! I'm so excited to
finally meet your family.

412
00:19:16,232 --> 00:19:20,435
Um...babe, I wanted to talk
to you about that, okay?

413
00:19:20,503 --> 00:19:24,005
I talked to them, and I don't know if
they're going to be able to make it.

414
00:19:24,073 --> 00:19:25,807
What are you
talking about?

415
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,042
It's our engagement party.
I know.

416
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,511
Philip, we're
getting married.

417
00:19:29,578 --> 00:19:31,646
Don't you think
it's strange

418
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:33,348
that I haven't met
your family?

419
00:19:33,415 --> 00:19:35,683
Well, we're
a strange family.

420
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,724
We're all nice
to you now, Philip,

421
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,092
but if you mess with
our little sister--

422
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:46,394
Yeah, okay, I promise--
I will be good.

423
00:19:46,462 --> 00:19:48,162
You have nothing to worry about.
You better be.

424
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,998
Hey, what are you doing
with my fiancé?

425
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:51,833
Nothing. No,
they're just scaring

426
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:53,401
the ever-living crap
out of me.

427
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:54,702
We like this guy.

428
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,170
I told you--
he's a good one.

429
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:58,573
And look--I found
my maid of honor.

430
00:19:58,641 --> 00:20:00,074
Ah, one of 19.

431
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:01,809
Not to mention
the three flower girls,

432
00:20:01,877 --> 00:20:03,344
the two ring bearers--

433
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,113
But you're my favorite.
Thank you.

434
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,082
No, I know it's not all
about just the one day.

435
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,618
It's about spending
the rest of my life...

436
00:20:10,686 --> 00:20:12,820
Sorry, can you guys
excuse me for a second?

437
00:20:12,888 --> 00:20:14,355
Yeah.

438
00:20:16,392 --> 00:20:20,061
Now, which one of you boys
wants to get me a drink?

439
00:20:22,031 --> 00:20:24,132
Philip.

440
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:27,535
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

441
00:20:27,603 --> 00:20:30,471
Oh, this house--
it's so beautiful.

442
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:31,906
It's--

443
00:20:31,974 --> 00:20:33,942
Philip...
Philip what?

444
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:36,444
Hey, I didn't scare you off with
all the wedding talk, did I?

445
00:20:36,512 --> 00:20:38,546
No, no, no.
Okay, sorry.

446
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:40,381
I'm Philip's mother.

447
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,251
Oh, my gosh!

448
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,153
It's so nice
to finally meet you!

449
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:48,156
My parents cannot wait

450
00:20:48,223 --> 00:20:50,058
to introduce you to everyone.
This is--

451
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,726
Okay, don't move.
I'll be right back.

452
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:53,828
I'll be right back.

453
00:20:53,896 --> 00:20:55,597
She's very beautiful.

454
00:20:55,664 --> 00:20:58,366
Mm-hmm.

455
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:01,169
Oh, I see your father's, huh?

456
00:21:01,236 --> 00:21:04,038
He's already good friends
with the McAllisters?

457
00:21:04,106 --> 00:21:06,374
You're still keeping
score, huh, Mom?

458
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,309
You know, if it makes you
feel any better,

459
00:21:08,377 --> 00:21:10,378
Dad's never met them
before today, either, okay?

460
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:15,216
The happy family
together again.

461
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:19,253
Well, I-- I'm not
seeing your brother,

462
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:21,356
so I'm guessing that
he wasn't invited.

463
00:21:21,423 --> 00:21:23,257
Guess whatever you want.

464
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:29,297
[overlapping chatter]

465
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:31,432
[music and chatter
drowns out]

466
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:21,649
[camera clicks]

467
00:22:25,187 --> 00:22:26,788
[camera clicking]

468
00:22:26,855 --> 00:22:28,856
So, I was thinking,
for every day,

469
00:22:28,924 --> 00:22:31,426
we could do the Kate Spade
Sag Harbor dinner plates

470
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,227
in the polka dots,

471
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:35,396
and then the salad
plates in stripes,

472
00:22:35,464 --> 00:22:37,932
because the stripes and the polka
dots look really good together.

473
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,767
Especially on the deck
of our beautiful beach house

474
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:42,303
that we're gonna have one day.
Nice.

475
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:44,939
And, for when we invite the
head of the hospital over--

476
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:47,542
who neither one of us
can stand--

477
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:49,544
I was thinking we could do
the Royal Doulton Etoile,

478
00:22:49,611 --> 00:22:51,813
or the Spode India Tree.
What do you think?

479
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,916
Oh, well, I think the guy that
comes up with these names

480
00:22:54,983 --> 00:22:57,018
has way too much time
on his hands, personally.

481
00:22:57,086 --> 00:22:59,954
[laughs] Ooh, and I got
the countdown going. Look.

482
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:05,026
I mean, I know
it's cheesy,

483
00:23:05,094 --> 00:23:07,028
but 's cute,
right?

484
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:09,397
[laughs] You know,
you gotta have it.

485
00:23:09,465 --> 00:23:11,032
Mm-hmm.

486
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,633
And it's in pink.

487
00:23:55,744 --> 00:23:58,846
Jan--Janet,
a friendly face.

488
00:23:58,914 --> 00:24:00,314
That is exactly
what I needed.

489
00:24:00,382 --> 00:24:02,316
You're in scrubs?
You look cute.

490
00:24:02,384 --> 00:24:05,353
Where were you today?
You missed a bunch of stuff on test.

491
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,221
I missed a lot of stuff.
But I don't really-- I don't care.

492
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:08,823
Because I've got you,
and you're gonna give me notes.

493
00:24:08,891 --> 00:24:10,558
Because you're
a good friend.

494
00:24:10,626 --> 00:24:13,060
Sorry, friend.
No, wait, wait, wait.

495
00:24:13,128 --> 00:24:16,798
Ohh!
Philip, you're drunk.

496
00:24:16,865 --> 00:24:18,332
We're friends, right?
Sure, we're friends.

497
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,567
But you're getting
a little close.

498
00:24:19,635 --> 00:24:21,068
Philip, stop.

499
00:24:21,136 --> 00:24:22,970
What--Come on.
No, knock it off!

500
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:24,972
Don't you say no to me.

501
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,374
Yeah? Watch me.
Really?

502
00:24:26,441 --> 00:24:28,209
What's wrong with you?

503
00:24:28,277 --> 00:24:29,744
What would your fiancée
say about this

504
00:24:29,812 --> 00:24:31,078
if she found out about you?

505
00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:33,481
Ohh!
What did you say?

506
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:35,616
You threatening me?

507
00:24:37,386 --> 00:24:39,120
Uh--

508
00:24:41,957 --> 00:24:43,591
Uh...

509
00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:02,643
Rhinestones.
Oh, okay.

510
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:04,445
Um...

511
00:25:04,513 --> 00:25:06,147
Wow.

512
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:08,616
Does that come with
a light switch?

513
00:25:11,053 --> 00:25:14,021
Let's look at
some other dresses.

514
00:25:17,459 --> 00:25:19,760
[laughter]

515
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:22,797
[Philip] Are these those
disposable phones,

516
00:25:22,865 --> 00:25:26,067
the ones that can't be traced
or tracked, anything like that?

517
00:25:26,134 --> 00:25:27,702
Yeah, no I.D.,
no nothing.

518
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:29,437
All right, thanks.

519
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:35,476
It's a lot of dress.

520
00:25:35,544 --> 00:25:36,878
I like the way it moves.

521
00:25:36,945 --> 00:25:39,013
Really?
Moves?

522
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:40,581
It's like a tsunami.

523
00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:42,483
Ohh.
Oh, my God.

524
00:25:42,551 --> 00:25:44,719
I am never
getting married.

525
00:25:44,786 --> 00:25:46,821
When you meet someone who makes you
feel like Philip makes me feel--

526
00:25:46,889 --> 00:25:48,823
and you will--
you'll do anything

527
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:50,324
to show him
how much you love him--

528
00:25:50,392 --> 00:25:53,261
even wear a tsunami dress.

529
00:25:53,328 --> 00:25:55,129
Oh, wow, okay.

530
00:25:55,197 --> 00:25:57,565
We've got cakes to taste.
Go, get changed.

531
00:25:57,633 --> 00:25:59,567
Quickly, quickly.
We have to go!

532
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:01,235
Don't touch anything.
We'll be back in an hour.

533
00:26:01,303 --> 00:26:03,471
We are going to find a dress.
Yes, we are.

534
00:26:03,505 --> 00:26:04,538
[laughter]

535
00:26:19,554 --> 00:26:22,723
[cell phone beeps]

536
00:26:37,673 --> 00:26:39,707
Mmm.
This is good.

537
00:26:39,775 --> 00:26:41,409
Oh, that's yummy.
You like it?

538
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:43,110
Mm-hmm.
Megs...

539
00:26:43,178 --> 00:26:45,112
you cannot go with this one.
Why not?

540
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,882
Because all of your guests
will die of pleasure,

541
00:26:48,016 --> 00:26:49,951
and you will have that
on your conscience.

542
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:52,353
I'm serious.
This is so good.

543
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:54,622
Let me see.
It's perfect.

544
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:55,957
[cell phone beeps]
Mmm!

545
00:26:56,024 --> 00:26:58,192
It's so good.

546
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,261
It's like
raspberry something.

547
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:02,163
Oh, you guys, look.

548
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,531
My fiancé misses me.

549
00:27:03,598 --> 00:27:05,766
Aww, he's the best
boyfriend ever.

550
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:07,335
Just a little bit
more of that.

551
00:27:07,402 --> 00:27:09,503
[laughter]

552
00:27:09,571 --> 00:27:12,173
Looks like a very
interesting project.

553
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,208
Yep.

554
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:16,177
You can put my number in any
of these phones, if you want.

555
00:27:16,244 --> 00:27:17,845
[chuckles]

556
00:27:33,762 --> 00:27:36,163
30, 32.

557
00:27:36,231 --> 00:27:37,832
Hope it's not
much longer.

558
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:40,401
I know. Let's hope
that she--

559
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:43,671
Wow.

560
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:45,439
Good one?

561
00:27:45,507 --> 00:27:47,308
Staggering. Wow.

562
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:49,410
I just want you
to love it.

563
00:27:49,478 --> 00:27:53,414
You are going to be the most
beautiful bride ever.

564
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:57,718
I'm getting married!

565
00:27:57,786 --> 00:27:59,920
[cheers and laughter]

566
00:28:01,123 --> 00:28:03,124
Congratulations!

567
00:28:09,831 --> 00:28:12,299
It's great.
This is the one for sure.

568
00:28:13,969 --> 00:28:16,904
I'll need to see
some I.D.

569
00:28:25,814 --> 00:28:27,982
That's me, man.

570
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,750
Brian Stevens.

571
00:28:29,818 --> 00:28:31,118
Yeah.

572
00:28:49,668 --> 00:28:51,636
[no audible dialogue]

573
00:28:51,703 --> 00:28:53,738
Hey, Phil.
Hey, man. How you doing?

574
00:28:53,805 --> 00:28:55,473
Janet, can I talk
to you for a sec?

575
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:57,808
Uh, sure.
Cool.

576
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:02,680
So, listen, I just wanted to
apologize for the other night,

577
00:29:02,748 --> 00:29:04,949
'cause I was really drunk.
No, I was out of line.

578
00:29:05,017 --> 00:29:06,584
Forget it.
And it's not okay.

579
00:29:06,652 --> 00:29:08,553
But I just want
to let you know--

580
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,521
if you even think about messing
with me and my fiancée,

581
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:11,822
I swear to God--

582
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,993
You understand?

583
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:17,562
Okay.
Yeah.

584
00:29:17,629 --> 00:29:19,497
All right. Good.

585
00:29:19,565 --> 00:29:21,098
[laughs]
Okay.

586
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:22,733
All right.

587
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:24,569
[clears throat]

588
00:29:24,636 --> 00:29:27,171
All right, guys, I'm out.
Got to get to class.

589
00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:29,941
Later dude.
All right, see you.

590
00:29:36,348 --> 00:29:38,516
[Man]
And that concludes

591
00:29:38,584 --> 00:29:40,251
the scintillating
video portion

592
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,919
of our presentation.

593
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:45,389
You will see
that offspring 4

594
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:48,793
is not sharing the same
characteristics

595
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,995
with offspring 7.

596
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:54,198
Mr. Markoff,
from which parent

597
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:58,803
did offspring 4
receive chromosome 13?

598
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,205
The father, obviously.
That locus is linked

599
00:30:01,273 --> 00:30:04,208
to congenital blindness, which
doesn't appear in the maternal line.

600
00:30:04,276 --> 00:30:06,777
Nobody likes a smartass,
Mr. Markoff. Thank you.

601
00:30:06,845 --> 00:30:09,413
All right, any questions?
Yes, sir.

602
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:11,015
STUDENT:
This genetic condition--

603
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,617
[beeping]

604
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:14,385
Philip,
call me back, please.

605
00:30:14,453 --> 00:30:16,354
I just tried to
take out some cash,

606
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:17,922
and it says the account
is overdrawn.

607
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,857
Don't worry about it.
I'll pay, my treat.

608
00:30:23,095 --> 00:30:25,830
Hey, baby it's me.
Can you call me back? Bye.

609
00:30:27,266 --> 00:30:29,233
I'm sure there's
an explanation.

610
00:30:29,301 --> 00:30:30,901
You should call
the bank or something.

611
00:30:30,969 --> 00:30:32,370
ATMs screw up
all the time.

612
00:30:32,437 --> 00:30:34,272
I've called Philip
three times

613
00:30:34,339 --> 00:30:36,207
in the past hour, and he
hasn't called me back.

614
00:30:36,275 --> 00:30:38,042
He's probably in class.

615
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,578
I'm telling you,
it's just a bank screw-up.

616
00:30:40,646 --> 00:30:42,446
You guys are starting
a life together, Megs.

617
00:30:42,514 --> 00:30:45,216
If you're gonna marry him,
you have to trust him.

618
00:30:46,652 --> 00:30:48,085
Okay?

619
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,764
Hey.

620
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:01,632
The strawberry is great.
Ooh.

621
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,068
[cell phone rings]
[gasps]

622
00:31:05,704 --> 00:31:08,105
See? Drama queen.

623
00:31:08,173 --> 00:31:10,508
Hello? Where have you been?
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

624
00:31:10,575 --> 00:31:12,276
<i>I'm at the dean's</i>
<i>office right now.</i>

625
00:31:12,344 --> 00:31:14,145
Listen, Megan,
I'm so sorry

626
00:31:14,212 --> 00:31:16,080
about the whole
money thing.

627
00:31:16,148 --> 00:31:18,316
I got this N.I.H. grant,
and the check came late,

628
00:31:18,383 --> 00:31:20,184
but I'm getting it
Monday morning,

629
00:31:20,252 --> 00:31:21,819
<i>so I'll put the money</i>
<i>back in the account</i>

630
00:31:21,887 --> 00:31:23,254
<i>first thing, okay?</i>

631
00:31:23,322 --> 00:31:25,356
No, it's okay.
I mean...yeah.

632
00:31:25,424 --> 00:31:27,958
No, no, no, no.
I'm totally serious.

633
00:31:28,026 --> 00:31:29,960
<i>We're supposed to be</i>
<i>a team, you know?</i>

634
00:31:30,028 --> 00:31:32,063
I want us to be able
to tell each other everything.

635
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,398
No secrets.
Look, sweetheart, I gotta let you go.

636
00:31:34,466 --> 00:31:36,634
<i>But I wanted to call</i>
<i>and let you know</i>

637
00:31:36,702 --> 00:31:39,403
<i>that I am very sorry.</i>
<i>Your fiancé is a big, dumb idiot,</i>

638
00:31:39,471 --> 00:31:41,405
and that it's all
taken care of.

639
00:31:41,473 --> 00:31:43,140
Okay.

640
00:31:43,208 --> 00:31:45,743
I love you so much.
<i>I love you, too.</i>

641
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:46,911
Bye.

642
00:31:46,978 --> 00:31:48,245
[pop]
[gasps]

643
00:31:48,313 --> 00:31:50,181
Yay!

644
00:31:50,248 --> 00:31:52,583
To my best friend's
wedding.

645
00:31:54,486 --> 00:31:56,253
Mmm, Red Sox, huh?

646
00:31:56,321 --> 00:31:58,823
My favorite team.
Come on in.

647
00:32:02,894 --> 00:32:04,628
You got some mail.

648
00:32:04,696 --> 00:32:06,430
Oh.

649
00:32:06,498 --> 00:32:07,932
It's from B.U.

650
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:10,468
Ooh, hello,
Dr. McAllister.

651
00:32:10,535 --> 00:32:12,403
It's really thin.
Open it.

652
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:21,679
"Dear Miss McAllister,
thank you for this application. We--"

653
00:32:21,747 --> 00:32:23,614
[sighs]

654
00:32:26,418 --> 00:32:28,686
No?

655
00:32:32,357 --> 00:32:34,759
Oh, man.

656
00:32:34,826 --> 00:32:36,660
But--

657
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:41,499
[laughs]

658
00:32:41,566 --> 00:32:43,768
You're way too cute
to be shy.

659
00:32:45,303 --> 00:32:47,905
Oh.

660
00:32:47,973 --> 00:32:50,775
Is that what you're into?
You want me to tie you up?

661
00:32:50,842 --> 00:32:53,944
No. You.

662
00:32:54,012 --> 00:32:56,313
But how am I gonna give you a
massage if my hands are tied?

663
00:32:56,381 --> 00:32:58,048
I don't want a massage.

664
00:32:58,116 --> 00:33:00,317
Okay, well,
I don't do bondage, so...

665
00:33:00,385 --> 00:33:02,887
I guess we're in a bit of
a standoff here, huh?

666
00:33:04,856 --> 00:33:07,491
All right. Get down on the floor.
Hands behind your back.

667
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,827
You don't have to do any of this--
All the way down!

668
00:33:09,895 --> 00:33:11,328
I'll give you
whatever you want.

669
00:33:11,396 --> 00:33:12,630
Shh, shh, shh.

670
00:33:12,697 --> 00:33:14,265
Put your hands
behind your back.

671
00:33:14,332 --> 00:33:16,700
All right.
Give me your hands.

672
00:33:16,768 --> 00:33:18,202
Put them up.

Trisha Leffler
from Las Vegas.

676
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:49,533
I know where
you live now.

677
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:51,635
This is an ATM card, right?
Yeah.

678
00:33:51,703 --> 00:33:53,671
What's your PIN?
4321.

679
00:33:53,738 --> 00:33:54,939
What's your PIN?

680
00:33:55,006 --> 00:33:56,507
It's 4321.

681
00:33:56,575 --> 00:33:59,877
[crying]
Please don't hurt me.

682
00:34:11,957 --> 00:34:14,925
Ohh, no!
Shut up. Shut up.

683
00:34:14,993 --> 00:34:17,761
Don't say a word.
Do you understand?

684
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:21,699
[muffled voices and music]

685
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:25,302
All right.

686
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,971
There you go.

687
00:34:27,038 --> 00:34:29,006
There you go.
Before I leave,

688
00:34:29,074 --> 00:34:31,175
I'm gonna take
a little souvenir, okay?

689
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:33,344
Hmm?
Yeah.

690
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:38,682
[crying]
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

691
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,317
It's okay.

692
00:34:40,385 --> 00:34:41,819

00:35:05,744 --> 00:35:07,945
Thank you.
Such a gentleman.

00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:32,120
to keep as a souvenir?
He took my phone

699
00:35:32,137 --> 00:35:34,171
and deleted the messages
he left for me.

700
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:35,873
[Officer] May I see
that phone, ma'am?

701
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,677
How'd he get
your number?

702
00:35:40,745 --> 00:35:43,614
He replied to my Craigslist ad,
and I texted him back.

703
00:35:46,684 --> 00:35:49,853
So, then this entirely
anonymous person--

704
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:51,889
who could've been
anybody-- you, uh,

705
00:35:51,956 --> 00:35:54,958
decided to invite him
up to your room?

706
00:35:55,026 --> 00:35:56,994
I'm usually a better judge.

707
00:35:57,062 --> 00:35:59,830
What were you advertising,
Miss Leffler? Massages.

708
00:35:59,898 --> 00:36:01,965
So, if we check your
record for any priors,

709
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:04,635
we're not gonna turn up
any, uh, solicitation, prostitution?

710
00:36:04,702 --> 00:36:08,672
Look, I'm not the criminal
here, okay? He is.

711
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,574
And I hope you nail
his preppy ass.

712
00:36:10,642 --> 00:36:13,077
I'm telling you,
what he did to m-

713
00:36:13,144 --> 00:36:16,080
he's done it before,
and he liked it.

714
00:36:16,147 --> 00:36:17,815
Liked what?

715
00:36:21,686 --> 00:36:23,520
I don't know.

716
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,424
Humiliating me.

717
00:36:36,701 --> 00:36:39,670
The one with the Red Sox cap,
just like the lady said.

718
00:36:39,737 --> 00:36:42,506
Calm, attractive,
non-threatening.

719
00:36:42,574 --> 00:36:44,942
A psycho who likes to rough up
defenseless women.

720
00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:48,011
Couldn't ask for
a better cover.

721
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:09,733
[Megan]
Philip?

722
00:37:09,801 --> 00:37:11,702
Baby?

723
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:13,604
Hey.

724
00:37:13,671 --> 00:37:16,006
I thought you weren't coming
back till tomorrow.

725
00:37:16,074 --> 00:37:18,175
I needed to see you.
Why, what happened?

726
00:37:18,243 --> 00:37:20,210
What happened, baby?

727
00:37:20,278 --> 00:37:22,346
I didn't get in.

728
00:37:22,413 --> 00:37:24,214
Ohh, sweetie.

729
00:37:24,282 --> 00:37:26,016
I knew it was a long shot,
but I thought...

730
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:27,518
maybe if I wasn't
in undergrad.

731
00:37:27,585 --> 00:37:30,787
Listen,
they're idiots, okay?

732
00:37:30,855 --> 00:37:33,657
Yeah, but they
accepted you.

733
00:37:33,725 --> 00:37:36,894
You see?
Which proves my point.

734
00:37:36,961 --> 00:37:38,395
[laughs]
It's not funny.

735
00:37:38,463 --> 00:37:41,064
Listen, I'll transfer
wherever you go.

736
00:37:41,132 --> 00:37:44,067
No, J don't want you
to transfer.

737
00:37:44,135 --> 00:37:46,303
I worked really hard,
you know? I really did.

738
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:47,804
I know.

739
00:37:47,872 --> 00:37:49,573
And now I just
ruined everything.

740
00:37:49,641 --> 00:37:51,975
No, baby, you did not
ruin anything, okay?

741
00:37:52,043 --> 00:37:54,545
Look at me.
You didn't ruin anything.

742
00:37:56,314 --> 00:37:58,182
B.U. was our plan. We were
supposed to be together.

743
00:37:58,249 --> 00:38:01,051
And we will be.

744
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,955
No matter what happens,
we're gonna be fine.

745
00:38:05,023 --> 00:38:08,892
Can we just stay like this
for a little bit?

746
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,262
We can stay like this
for as long as you want.

747
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:16,433
It's just you and me,
Pocket.

748
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:20,137
Nothing else matters.

749
00:38:31,983 --> 00:38:33,884
You really got to
go away again?

750
00:38:33,952 --> 00:38:37,020
Final fitting.
No, no final fitting.

751
00:38:37,088 --> 00:38:39,022
I love you.

752
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,724
Love you, too.

753
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,331
Call me when you get there, okay?
Okay, I will.

754
00:38:47,398 --> 00:38:48,932
Okay.
Bye.

755
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,434
Bye.

756
00:38:53,004 --> 00:38:54,905
[starts engine]

757
00:39:03,848 --> 00:39:07,217
"Dear Miss McAllister,
we regret to inform you that--"

758
00:39:07,285 --> 00:39:09,553
Well...

759
00:39:09,621 --> 00:39:11,488
I guess
that decides it.

760
00:39:11,556 --> 00:39:13,257
On to plan B.

761
00:39:13,324 --> 00:39:15,425
Oh, man, you're in.

762
00:39:15,493 --> 00:39:18,562
St. Kitts.
This is fantastic!

763
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,265
It's such a great program.
Look, baby.

764
00:39:21,299 --> 00:39:24,635
But, Mom, that's-- that's
a million miles away.

765
00:39:24,702 --> 00:39:27,571
I can't move a million miles
away from my husband.

766
00:39:30,174 --> 00:39:32,209
Well, if he loves you now,

767
00:39:32,277 --> 00:39:36,280
he's going to love you in five
years after you graduate, right?

768
00:39:36,347 --> 00:39:39,316
Mom...I really don't
want to disappoint you.

769
00:39:39,384 --> 00:39:41,118
Oh, honey,
you could never--

770
00:39:41,185 --> 00:39:43,020
Baby, you'll never
disappoint me.

771
00:39:43,087 --> 00:39:45,122
It's just--

772
00:39:45,189 --> 00:39:47,190
It would be such a waste.

773
00:39:47,258 --> 00:39:50,027
You are so bright
and so compassionate.

774
00:39:50,094 --> 00:39:52,396
You would make
an amazing doctor.

775
00:39:52,463 --> 00:39:54,131
I've thought
about this a lot.

776
00:39:54,198 --> 00:39:56,099
If we can't go to
medical school together,

777
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:57,934
then I'll just wait.

778
00:39:58,002 --> 00:40:01,138
I can always reapply
later if I want to.

779
00:40:01,205 --> 00:40:05,275
But for now,
this is what I want.

780
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:48,819
[cell phone ringing]

781
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,028
Hello?
<i>[Megan] Hey, guess where I am.</i>

782
00:40:58,096 --> 00:41:00,364
I'm so glad I got you.
Listen, I was thinking--

783
00:41:00,431 --> 00:41:01,865
what about a beach wedding?

784
00:41:01,933 --> 00:41:03,600
We'd have a beautiful
sunset ceremony.

785
00:41:03,668 --> 00:41:06,136
I was just sleeping.
Can I call you later?

786
00:41:06,204 --> 00:41:07,671
You were? It's the middle
of the afternoon.

787
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:09,740
<i>I know. I've been</i>
<i>working hard.</i>

788
00:41:09,807 --> 00:41:12,042
Okay, yeah,
I'll call you later. I love you.

789
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:14,878
<i>Okay.</i>
Bye.

790
00:41:14,946 --> 00:41:17,047
So, what's up?
What did he say?

791
00:41:17,115 --> 00:41:18,749
Did he like
your idea?

792
00:41:18,816 --> 00:41:20,350
Yeah, he loved it.
He was just studying.

793
00:41:20,418 --> 00:41:23,120
But he liked it.
It's gonna be amazing.

794
00:41:42,774 --> 00:41:45,208
[chuckles]

795
00:41:45,276 --> 00:41:46,877
[cell phone rings]

796
00:41:46,944 --> 00:41:48,745
Hold on one second,
okay, Mom?

797
00:41:48,813 --> 00:41:49,880
<i>Okay.</i>

798
00:41:56,254 --> 00:41:57,587
I gotta go.

799
00:41:57,655 --> 00:41:59,222
<i>Why? What's wrong?</i>
<i>You okay?</i>

800
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:00,457
I'm-- I'm fine.

801
00:42:00,525 --> 00:42:01,892
<i>Then why</i>
<i>do you have to go?</i>

802
00:42:01,959 --> 00:42:04,861
Um, I'm going to see
a guy I met on the train.

803
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:06,530
<i>What guy? Is he cute?</i>
<i>What's he do?</i>

804
00:42:06,597 --> 00:42:08,165
He's a student.
<i>In?</i>

805
00:42:08,232 --> 00:42:09,466
I don't know what in.

806
00:42:09,534 --> 00:42:10,967
<i>You got to know something</i>
<i>about hi, honey.</i>

807
00:42:11,035 --> 00:42:12,169
<i>Where's he from?</i>

808
00:42:12,236 --> 00:42:14,004
I promise I will
get you the whole 411.

809
00:42:14,071 --> 00:42:16,039
<i>Okay, have fun.</i>
<i>I love you, Julissa.</i>

810
00:42:16,107 --> 00:42:17,674
I love you, too.

[elevator dings]

812
00:42:33,624 --> 00:42:36,259
Are you Brian?
Yeah.

813
00:42:36,327 --> 00:42:37,828
You're beautiful.

814
00:42:37,895 --> 00:42:40,564
You're not so bad
yourself.

815
00:42:42,166 --> 00:42:44,201
Ready?
Yeah.

816
00:42:45,436 --> 00:42:47,003
Um...

817
00:42:47,071 --> 00:42:49,706
what do you do here
in Boston, Brian?

818
00:42:49,774 --> 00:42:53,109
I'm, uh,
a grad student.

819
00:42:53,177 --> 00:42:55,178
What do you study?
Sciences.

820
00:42:55,246 --> 00:42:57,147
Oh, that is so cool.

821
00:42:57,215 --> 00:43:00,350
I'm actually doing grad work
myself right now in New York.

822
00:43:00,418 --> 00:43:02,652
Drug and alcohol
counseling, I figure.

823
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,590
Nobody knows the territory like somebody
who's been there themselves, right?

824
00:43:06,657 --> 00:43:09,459
Get down on the ground.
Put your hands behind your back right now.

825
00:43:09,527 --> 00:43:10,494

Aah!

826
00:43:10,561 --> 00:43:12,329
Ow!

827
00:43:12,396 --> 00:43:13,630
Uhh!

828
00:43:13,698 --> 00:43:15,565
Just get on the gr--

no forcible entry.

832
00:43:32,368 --> 00:43:34,503
Sound familiar?

833
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,173
One difference-- CSI said
there was skin under the fingernails.

834
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,541
She fought back,
so he shot her.

835
00:43:39,609 --> 00:43:40,976
He's stepping it up.

836
00:43:41,044 --> 00:43:42,511
Yeah.

00:43:48,818 --> 00:43:50,018

838
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,420

Whoa. I scared you.

Dr. Shaneway...
I'm sorry, sir.

842
00:43:57,694 --> 00:43:59,528
I'm a little jumpy,
I guess.

843
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,663
I've been staying awake
two nights in a row,

00:44:01,731 --> 00:44:03,098
memorizing
genetic sequences.

845
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:04,866
Trying to impress me.

00:44:04,934 --> 00:44:06,368
Always, sir.

847
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:08,203
How's your fiancée?

848
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,072
Good, great.
I mean, um...

849
00:44:10,139 --> 00:44:12,274
you know,
we've both got school.

850
00:44:12,342 --> 00:44:14,276
[clears throat]
And then there's the wedding.

851
00:44:14,344 --> 00:44:16,979
So, it's a lot.
I bet.

852
00:44:17,046 --> 00:44:18,814
Well, um,
I'd better get going.

853
00:44:18,881 --> 00:44:20,615
But, um...
have a good evening.

854
00:44:20,683 --> 00:44:22,951
You, too, Phillip,
and try to get some rest.

855
00:44:23,019 --> 00:44:24,686
Okay. Yeah, I will.

856
00:44:36,265 --> 00:44:37,799
Hey.
Hey. I'm sorry.

857
00:44:37,867 --> 00:44:39,201
You didn't give me
a kiss when you got in.

858
00:44:39,268 --> 00:44:40,736
I know, I didn't
want to wake you--

859
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,304
Oh, my God.
What happened to your neck?

860
00:44:42,372 --> 00:44:43,805
A woman went psychotic
in the ER tonight.

861
00:44:43,873 --> 00:44:45,907
It was crazy.
She went nuts.

862
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:48,210
She hurt a nurse, so I had
to step in and do something.

863
00:44:48,277 --> 00:44:49,745
My hero.

864
00:44:51,714 --> 00:44:53,548
Come to bed.

865
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,300
We may have just
caught a break.

866
00:45:12,368 --> 00:45:15,137
A friend of Julissa's just called,
got me into her phone.

867
00:45:15,204 --> 00:45:17,973
We have the text she got from the
last guy she had an appointment with.

868
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:20,409
Digital Forensics
can get an I.P. off that.

869
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:22,778
We can get an address,
maybe even a name.

870

fries by the internet,
right?

1041
00:54:38,238 --> 00:54:40,606
He's not frying yet.
It's an apartment complex,

1042
00:54:40,674 --> 00:54:42,575
so the killer could've been using
someone else's wireless signal.

1043
00:54:42,642 --> 00:54:44,910
Then I want a full
tenant list for that building.

1044
00:54:44,978 --> 00:54:47,046
I want six units down there,
six invisible units.

1045
00:54:47,114 --> 00:54:49,749
And I want 100 copies
of this picture blown up.

1046
00:54:49,816 --> 00:54:54,053
Let's hope the coffee's
good down in Quincy.

1047
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:56,255
[Bennett] No, no, no.
Listen to me, listen to me.

1048
00:54:56,323 --> 00:54:58,424
I don't want you hanging out
in the mall on a school night.

1049
00:54:58,492 --> 00:55:00,259
You understand?

1050
00:55:00,327 --> 00:55:03,462
Okay, all right.
You got a ride?

1051
00:55:05,899 --> 00:55:07,633
Do I know him?

1052
00:55:09,536 --> 00:55:11,837
Okay. All right.

1053
00:55:11,905 --> 00:55:14,140
Great, I love you, baby.
I'll see you back at the house.

1054
00:55:15,809 --> 00:55:17,743
This guy
is driving me crazy.

1055
00:55:17,811 --> 00:55:20,346
I mean, he's turning me
into my old man here.

1056
00:55:20,414 --> 00:55:22,982
I'm two seconds away from locking
my daughter up for good.

1057
00:55:23,049 --> 00:55:25,184
Gotta let her go
at some point.

1058
00:55:25,252 --> 00:55:26,986
Do I?

1059
00:55:31,258 --> 00:55:33,959
There's got to be
800 units in this place.

1060
00:55:34,027 --> 00:55:36,729
Great. All we've got to do now
is wait for a guy to waltz by

1061
00:55:36,797 --> 00:55:39,331
who looks like
a vicious loner killer

1062
00:55:39,399 --> 00:55:41,400
with emotional issues.

1063
00:55:47,374 --> 00:55:49,208
You're kidding me,
right?

1064
00:55:49,276 --> 00:55:50,677
This guy
could be anybody.

1065
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:52,824
You got another picture
I can look at? Anything?

1066
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:55,092
If you see anyone,
just give me a call.

Good luck with that,

[laughs]
Hey.

1070
00:56:05,337 --> 00:56:07,038
Before we go...
What?

1071
00:56:07,105 --> 00:56:09,273
What are we having
for dinner tonight?

1072
00:56:09,341 --> 00:56:12,243
Making something good?
I don't know yet.

1073
00:56:12,311 --> 00:56:13,678
You don't have
to cook tonight.

1074
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,213
No, I want to.

1075
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,914
Okay. Laundry time
first, though.

1076
00:56:23,355 --> 00:56:25,022

1078
00:56:32,698 --> 00:56:35,433
Philip Markoff,
residing in Quincy, Mass.

1079

Are you kidding me?

1080
00:56:37,803 --> 00:56:40,671
I mean, come on, you put
a baseball cap on that freak,

1081
00:56:40,739 --> 00:56:42,173
we've definitely
got our guy.

1082
00:56:42,241 --> 00:56:43,841
He's a med student
at B.U.

1083
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:46,077
478 friends.

1084
00:56:46,144 --> 00:56:48,613
Who the hell would want
478 friends?

00:56:54,486 --> 00:56:55,953
Quite a catch,
this fella, huh?

1088
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:57,655
We can always bring him in,
question him.

1089
00:56:57,723 --> 00:56:59,957
No, no, no, no.

1090
00:57:00,025 --> 00:57:02,793
We stop by, he's not there,
he hears we showed up--

1091
00:57:02,861 --> 00:57:04,528
he's off to Brazil.

1092
00:57:04,596 --> 00:57:06,197
I don't want to spook him.

1093
00:57:06,265 --> 00:57:08,599

keep him under surveillance,

You and me, right now.
I'm getting cabin fever.

We can check into a hotel,
get some room service.

Oh.

No, we should go to Foxwoods.
It'll be like a pre-honeymoon.

doing this? Wait.

some questions.

01:02:18,677 --> 01:02:21,078
Up. You have the right
to remain silent.

Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

What is going on?
You have the right to an attorney.

If you cannot afford one,
one will be appointed by the court.

as they've been read to you?

Yes.

of books under his bed, huh?

I used to do the same
thing in college.

1196

buying shelves.

01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:44,806
How many you got there?

1208
01:03:44,874 --> 01:03:47,609
13, 14, 15, 16.

1209
01:03:47,677 --> 01:03:49,645
16.

1210
01:03:49,712 --> 01:03:51,613
Only three reported.

1211
01:03:51,681 --> 01:03:53,215
Obviously the others didn't
want their mothers to know

1212
01:03:53,283 --> 01:03:55,083
what they do
for a living, right?

1213
01:03:55,151 --> 01:03:57,319
With all due respect,
Detectives,

1214
01:03:57,387 --> 01:03:58,854
you're embarrassing
yourselves.

1215
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:00,455
All right?
What have you got?

1216
01:04:00,523 --> 01:04:03,091
You got a superficial
resemblance to what?

1217
01:04:03,159 --> 01:04:05,861
An out-of-focus
surveillance video?

1218
01:04:05,928 --> 01:04:08,330
Well, we got flex cuffs,
16 pairs of women's panties,

1219
01:04:08,398 --> 01:04:10,732
and a 9 millimeter.

1220
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,235
All right, well,
you've got some party favors,

1221
01:04:13,303 --> 01:04:15,370
and you've got
some unwashed laundry,

1222
01:04:15,438 --> 01:04:18,273
and, yeah, I bought a gun
to protect my fiancée.

1223
01:04:18,341 --> 01:04:21,677
I mean, we live in
a sketchy neighborhood, sir.
Is that right?

1224
01:04:21,744 --> 01:04:24,613
We spoke to the owner of the
gun shop up in New Hampshire.

1225
01:04:24,681 --> 01:04:29,084
He says he, uh, sold the gun
to a Brian Stevens.

1226
01:04:29,152 --> 01:04:32,287
Whose I.D. happened to be
in your top drawer.

1227
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:38,293
You want to explain to us
why you purchased a weapon

1228
01:04:38,361 --> 01:04:39,995
with somebody else's I.D.?

1229
01:04:45,935 --> 01:04:49,604
Sir, I'm a straight-A
medical student.

1230
01:04:49,672 --> 01:04:53,475
I'm-- I'm getting married
in a month.

1231
01:04:53,543 --> 01:04:56,211
I mean, would you guys
care to explain to me

1232
01:04:56,279 --> 01:04:59,514
why I would go around and--

1233
01:04:59,582 --> 01:05:02,584
and shoot prostitutes
in hotel rooms?

1234
01:05:04,287 --> 01:05:07,122
What, you still don't
believe me?

1235
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:09,658
Ask around.

1236
01:05:09,726 --> 01:05:12,394
[Megan] You have no idea
how wrong you are about Philip.

1237
01:05:12,462 --> 01:05:16,031
Do you know where he was between
9:00 and 11:00 pm on April 14?

1238
01:05:16,099 --> 01:05:17,632
He's dedicated
his whole life

1239
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:19,768
to becoming a doctor
and helping people.

1240
01:05:19,836 --> 01:05:23,138
So, you don't know where he was
between 9:00 and 11:00 on April 14?

1241
01:05:23,206 --> 01:05:25,107
He's a medical
student, okay?

1242
01:05:25,174 --> 01:05:27,442
He spends thousands of hours
at the library and the lab,

1243
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:29,978
and I'm sure there's people
there that have seen him.

1244
01:05:30,046 --> 01:05:31,613
We'll be sure
to check that out.

1245
01:05:31,681 --> 01:05:33,448
There's nothing
to check out.

1246
01:05:33,516 --> 01:05:34,850
This is a huge
mistake, okay?

1247
01:05:34,917 --> 01:05:36,418
Philip is not a killer.

1248
01:05:36,486 --> 01:05:39,388
Did you know that
we found handcuffs,

1249
01:05:39,455 --> 01:05:42,257
a 9 millimeter pistol,
and 16 pairs of women's panties

1250
01:05:42,325 --> 01:05:44,126
stuffed under
your mattress?

1251
01:05:44,193 --> 01:05:45,794
Did you know that?

1252
01:05:47,697 --> 01:05:50,665
I'm marrying Philip
on August 14.

1253
01:05:50,733 --> 01:05:52,534
You don't think I know
my own fiancé?

1254
01:05:52,602 --> 01:05:54,336
You don't think
that I would've known

1255
01:05:54,404 --> 01:05:55,937
if there was a gun
under my own--

1256
01:05:56,005 --> 01:05:57,472
I don't know what
you know, Miss McAllister.

1257
01:05:59,642 --> 01:06:01,510
Look, am I under arrest or something?
No.

1258
01:06:01,577 --> 01:06:03,545
In fact,
you're free to go.

1259
01:06:03,613 --> 01:06:05,680
But you can't go back
to your apartment.

1260
01:06:05,748 --> 01:06:08,450
And your car's been
impounded as evidence.

1261
01:06:08,518 --> 01:06:10,352
If I'm free to go,
then I'm going.

1262
01:06:37,914 --> 01:06:42,184
Are you telling me that
one of our top students

1263
01:06:42,251 --> 01:06:43,518
is the Craigslist
Killer?

1264
01:06:43,586 --> 01:06:45,187
No, no, we're just
investigating at this point,

1265
01:06:45,254 --> 01:06:47,189
checking out his story.

1266
01:06:47,256 --> 01:06:49,424
So, you're saying
he was actually here,

1267
01:06:49,492 --> 01:06:51,960
you know, studying,
being a student?

1268
01:06:52,028 --> 01:06:54,429
I'm saying he was
actually here

1269
01:06:54,497 --> 01:06:57,499
being a star in all
of his classes.

1270
01:06:57,567 --> 01:06:59,301
Look, Lieutenant,
I don't know if you know

1271
01:06:59,368 --> 01:07:01,203
just how hard it is to
be a medical student.

1272
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:03,438
It's not
physically possible

1273
01:07:03,506 --> 01:07:05,340
for someone to do
as brilliantly

1274
01:07:05,408 --> 01:07:07,275
as Philip has done

1275
01:07:07,343 --> 01:07:09,211
in one of the most competitive
programs in the country,

1276
01:07:09,278 --> 01:07:13,348
and then run off to Rhode Island
and commit these crimes.

1277
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:16,318
Not physically possible.

1278
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:25,694
[buzzer sounds]

1279
01:07:48,951 --> 01:07:52,053
[inmates shouting]

1280
01:08:22,151 --> 01:08:24,085
[buzzer sounds]

1281
01:08:24,153 --> 01:08:26,154
[inmates shouting]

1282
01:08:31,861 --> 01:08:34,529
[David] How did these
people get here?

1283
01:08:34,597 --> 01:08:35,931
How did they know?

1284
01:08:35,998 --> 01:08:38,099
[Reporter]
How could you not know?

1285
01:08:38,167 --> 01:08:39,868
Dad, what--

1286
01:08:39,936 --> 01:08:41,236
Do not talk to them.

1287
01:08:41,304 --> 01:08:43,238
I want you to go
inside right away.

1288
01:08:48,644 --> 01:08:50,278
[reporters chattering]

1289
01:08:50,346 --> 01:08:52,347
[Reporter]
Megan! Megan!

1290
01:08:52,415 --> 01:08:54,583
[Michael] You guys are on
private property.

1291
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:57,986
You must step off
of my property. Now.

1292
01:08:58,054 --> 01:09:00,388
[inmates shouting]

1293
01:09:52,808 --> 01:09:55,343
Seven! Seven! Seven!

1294
01:09:55,411 --> 01:09:57,479
[buzzer sounds]

1295
01:09:59,815 --> 01:10:02,017
[grunts]

1296
01:10:02,084 --> 01:10:03,451
[gasps]

1297
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:06,121
[coughing]

1298
01:10:11,527 --> 01:10:13,294
[Megan] They won't
even let me call him.

1299
01:10:13,362 --> 01:10:15,664
I mean, he's in there
all alone, and I can't even--

1300
01:10:15,731 --> 01:10:18,366
I can't talk to him.
I can't do anything. I'm so sorry.

1301
01:10:18,434 --> 01:10:20,702
When this is all over,
I'm going to make sure

1302
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:22,537
that he demands
an apology,

1303
01:10:22,605 --> 01:10:24,773
because a doctor cannot
have an accusation like this

1304
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:26,708
hanging over his head.
This is ridiculous.

1305
01:10:26,776 --> 01:10:29,744
Look, we don't even really
know what happened.

1306
01:10:29,812 --> 01:10:31,546
Of course we do.
They arrested the wrong guy.

1307
01:10:31,614 --> 01:10:33,214
That's what happened.

1308
01:10:33,282 --> 01:10:36,251
I'm just saying,
there's a lot of the story

1309
01:10:36,318 --> 01:10:38,720
that we still don't know.

1310
01:10:38,788 --> 01:10:41,356
Oh, my God. You guys are
just like everybody else.

1311
01:10:41,424 --> 01:10:43,692
You really think
that he's a killer?

1312
01:10:43,759 --> 01:10:45,293
You think that
he's a killer,

1313
01:10:45,361 --> 01:10:47,062
and I've been living
with him this whole time?

1314
01:10:47,129 --> 01:10:48,563
And I didn't know?
No, no.

1315
01:10:48,631 --> 01:10:50,465
That I'm that stupid?

1316
01:10:50,533 --> 01:10:53,301
I mean, Mom, come on.
If someone came to the door

1317
01:10:53,369 --> 01:10:56,271
and told you that Dad is a killer,
would you believe him?

1318
01:10:59,341 --> 01:11:00,875
Oh, my God.

1319
01:11:00,943 --> 01:11:03,678
Sweetie, we just feel--

1320
01:11:03,746 --> 01:11:06,047
Unfortunately,
you are here today

1321
01:11:06,115 --> 01:11:07,782
because you were given
the wrong information,

1322
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:09,584
as was the public.

1323
01:11:09,652 --> 01:11:11,953
Philip Markoff
is a beautiful person

1324
01:11:12,021 --> 01:11:15,156
inside and out,
and couldn't hurt a fly.

1325
01:11:15,224 --> 01:11:17,759
A police officer in Boston,
or several,

1326
01:11:17,827 --> 01:11:20,061
is trying to make big bucks
by selling a false story

1327
01:11:20,129 --> 01:11:22,597
to the TV stations.
What else is new?

1328
01:11:22,665 --> 01:11:24,733
<i>Philip is an intelligent man</i>

1329
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,669
<i>who is just trying</i>
<i>to live his life.</i>

1330
01:11:27,737 --> 01:11:30,038
<i>So, if you could leave us alone,</i>
<i>we would appreciate it.</i>

1331
01:11:30,106 --> 01:11:32,607

1333
01:11:35,644 --> 01:11:37,145
<i>Thank you.</i>

1334
01:11:39,248 --> 01:11:41,282
Our boy sure picked
the right girl.

1335
01:11:43,486 --> 01:11:46,121
<i>[Man] I've known</i>
<i>Phil Markoff since sophomore year.</i>

1336
01:11:46,188 --> 01:11:47,889
<i>I can't even</i>
<i>put into words</i>

1337
01:11:47,957 --> 01:11:49,524
<i>the disbelief I'm</i>

1338
01:11:49,592 --> 01:11:51,493

1339
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:53,428

1340

<i>[Reporter] As Markoff</i>

1341
01:11:55,731 --> 01:11:57,565
<i>it's the taxpayers</i>
<i>of Massachusetts</i>

1342

01:12:00,136 --> 01:12:02,804
<i>Doing the honors will be well-known</i>
<i>public defender Robert Grossman.</i>

1344
01:12:02,872 --> 01:12:05,173
A public defender?
That's insane!

1345
01:12:05,241 --> 01:12:07,442
His parents aren't even
paying for a lawyer?

1346
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:10,278
Dad, do you know somebody?
We have to help him.

1347
01:12:10,346 --> 01:12:13,081
<i>Although Markoff is being</i>
<i>kept away from the media,</i>

1349
01:12:18,254 --> 01:12:20,288
We got him.
He's got a public defender.

1350
01:12:20,356 --> 01:12:22,390
Is that right?

1351
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:25,593
2005--a guy gets his underage
girlfriend pregnant.

1352
01:12:25,661 --> 01:12:27,996
Tried to dodge statutory rape.
He and his buddy

1353
01:12:28,063 --> 01:12:30,198
kill her with a knife and a brick,
and toss her in the gutter.

1354
01:12:30,266 --> 01:12:32,700
Cops have fingerprints, DNA,
confessions from both.

1355
01:12:32,768 --> 01:12:34,836
The buddy gets 20 years.

1356
01:12:34,904 --> 01:12:37,272
Ken Braniff gets
Grossman as a lawyer--

1357
01:12:37,339 --> 01:12:39,440
goes free.

1358
01:12:39,508 --> 01:12:41,876
He's walking the streets
of Boston today.

1359
01:12:41,944 --> 01:12:45,046
That's not true.
Is that true?

1360
01:12:45,114 --> 01:12:48,016
Heh. Robert Grossman
can make an alibi

1361
01:12:48,083 --> 01:12:50,285
out of two sticks
and a ball of twine.

1362
01:12:50,352 --> 01:12:52,720
Then we need to make
a preemptive strike

1363
01:12:52,788 --> 01:12:55,290
on Markoff's alibis.

1364
01:12:57,226 --> 01:12:59,427
Was that the door?
I don't know.

1365
01:13:06,635 --> 01:13:09,003
No reporters on the property.
I'm gonna call the police.

1366
01:13:09,071 --> 01:13:11,172
They are
the police.

1367
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:13,541
How are you, Megan?
Good to see you again.
Fine.

1368
01:13:13,609 --> 01:13:15,677
Detective Bennett,
Boston P.D.

1369
01:13:15,744 --> 01:13:18,947
She was lucky. She got out with
only two busted ribs.

1370
01:13:19,014 --> 01:13:21,716
He hit her so hard in the face,
she's still having trouble seeing.

1371
01:13:21,784 --> 01:13:23,952
Look, you guys have
the wrong guy, okay?

1372
01:13:24,019 --> 01:13:26,788
Philip isn't capable of killing anybody.
Are you sure?

1373
01:13:26,856 --> 01:13:28,756
Everybody knows that
the Boston Police Department

1374
01:13:28,824 --> 01:13:30,291
is the worst
in the country.

1375
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:32,660
This isn't about
the Boston P.D.

1376
01:13:32,728 --> 01:13:35,964
We're trying to figure out who
murdered an innocent young woman.

1377
01:13:36,031 --> 01:13:37,932
We have a positive I.D.
from a woman he beat up

1378
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,400
and robbed in Rhode Island.

1379
01:13:41,904 --> 01:13:43,705
[sighs]

1380
01:13:43,772 --> 01:13:46,307
I believe in Philip,
Lieutenant.

1381
01:13:46,375 --> 01:13:49,143
Did you know your boyfriend posted
on a sexual fetish web site

1382
01:13:49,211 --> 01:13:53,314
under the username
"SexAddict53885"?

1383
01:13:53,382 --> 01:13:56,217
We took it right off
his hard drive.

1384
01:13:56,285 --> 01:13:59,554
You--You guys could've
put that on there.

1385
01:13:59,622 --> 01:14:01,990
Digital forensics can prove
that Philip made these postings

1386
01:14:02,057 --> 01:14:05,159
long before he killed Julissa
Brisman with a 9 millimeter.

1387
01:14:05,227 --> 01:14:07,195
Her skull fragments
were found

1388
01:14:07,263 --> 01:14:09,530
embedded in the wall
in the hotel room.

1389
01:14:09,598 --> 01:14:11,766
She died choking
on her own blood.

1390
01:14:11,834 --> 01:14:15,403
SexAddict53885 was into--
and I quote--

1391
01:14:15,471 --> 01:14:17,038
"submission
and humiliation".

1392
01:14:17,106 --> 01:14:18,806
All right, I'd like you
to stop this now--

1393
01:14:18,874 --> 01:14:21,476
Whoa, whoa.
Also on his list...

1394
01:14:21,543 --> 01:14:23,945
was "friendship
and experimentation

1395
01:14:24,013 --> 01:14:25,580
with transvestites
and transsexuals."

1396
01:14:25,648 --> 01:14:27,415
I said that's enough!

1397
01:14:27,483 --> 01:14:28,883
That's not Philip.

1398
01:14:28,951 --> 01:14:30,618
He's got a description
of himself here.

1399
01:14:30,686 --> 01:14:32,620
"Born February 12,
1986.

1400
01:14:32,688 --> 01:14:35,056
"6'4",
blond, athletic.

1401
01:14:35,124 --> 01:14:36,524
Eight inches, cut."

1402
01:14:36,592 --> 01:14:37,992
That's enough!
You're out of here.

1403
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:39,727
Does that
physical description

1404
01:14:39,795 --> 01:14:41,462
match your absolute
knowledge of your fiancé?

1405
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:43,598
Detective, stop this now.
Get out of here.

1406
01:14:43,666 --> 01:14:45,400
Is that your perfect fiancé?
Don't put that--

1407
01:14:45,467 --> 01:14:47,101
Get them out of here!

1408
01:14:47,169 --> 01:14:48,603
You've done enough!
You stop this now.

1409
01:14:48,671 --> 01:14:50,338
Megan!

1410
01:14:50,406 --> 01:14:52,240
You want to bully people?
Get out of my house.

1411
01:14:52,308 --> 01:14:54,909
Leave our home now.

1412
01:14:57,913 --> 01:14:59,414
[vomits]

1413
01:15:19,329 --> 01:15:21,364
[buzzer sounds]

1414
01:15:28,739 --> 01:15:31,474
[Bennett] You sure you want
to do this to Megan?

1415
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:33,843
I thought you loved her.

1416
01:15:33,911 --> 01:15:36,045
I didn't do it.

1417
01:15:36,113 --> 01:15:38,214
You can spare everybody
a lot of pain.

1418
01:15:38,282 --> 01:15:40,783
You want her
to see you like this?

1419
01:15:40,851 --> 01:15:42,985
How ugly you are?

1420
01:15:44,454 --> 01:15:46,155
I didn't do it.

1421
01:15:46,223 --> 01:15:48,691
It's going to be
a circus, Phil.

1422
01:15:48,759 --> 01:15:50,660
There's going
to be pictures.

1423
01:15:50,727 --> 01:15:53,596
The media, they're going
to turn you into a monster.

1424
01:15:58,735 --> 01:16:00,603
Phil...

1425
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:03,539
talk to me, all right?

1426
01:16:03,607 --> 01:16:06,542
I mean, I don't--
I don't get it.

1427
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:08,978
You had everything--

1428
01:16:09,046 --> 01:16:11,147
a beautiful girl
who loved you,

1429
01:16:11,215 --> 01:16:12,982
a bright future.

1430
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:15,151
If you'd played your cards right,
years from now,

1431
01:16:15,219 --> 01:16:17,486
you'd be a rich doctor,
having dinner parties

1432
01:16:17,554 --> 01:16:19,722
on the Vineyard
with your wife and kids.

1433
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:21,724
Right?

1434
01:16:21,792 --> 01:16:24,293
You'd be living the dream.

1435
01:16:24,361 --> 01:16:27,563
Instead of...
rotting in here.

1436
01:16:27,631 --> 01:16:31,000
Help me out, Phil.

1437
01:16:31,068 --> 01:16:34,904
I need it to make sense--
for me.

1438
01:16:36,907 --> 01:16:39,075
Why would you do this?

1439
01:16:39,142 --> 01:16:41,577
Why would you hurt
those people?

1440
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:45,881
Why would you
throw it all away?

1441
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:05,935
<i>We've been talking</i>
<i>about Philip Markoff</i>

1442
01:17:06,003 --> 01:17:08,571
<i>and allegations about other</i>
<i>killers leading double lives,</i>

1443
01:17:08,639 --> 01:17:10,773
<i>and frequently</i>
<i>the women who love them,</i>

1444
01:17:10,807 --> 01:17:12,541
<i>or at least who always seem</i>
<i>surprised when the cops--</i>

1445
01:17:12,609 --> 01:17:15,578
That is not going
to make you feel better.

1446
01:17:15,646 --> 01:17:17,913
It won't?
No.

1447
01:17:20,884 --> 01:17:26,856
[sighs] I tried going over it
in my head, and--

1448
01:17:26,923 --> 01:17:29,058
You know,
what didn't I see?

1449
01:17:29,126 --> 01:17:33,029
He was--
He was a med student.

1450
01:17:33,096 --> 01:17:35,698
He worked late.

1451
01:17:35,766 --> 01:17:38,134
He was on his computer
late at night.

1452
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:42,338
How is that different from
any other guy at B.U.?

1453
01:17:42,406 --> 01:17:45,007
It's not.
So...

1454
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:48,778
how was I supposed
to make that leap?

1455
01:17:48,845 --> 01:17:53,182
Megs...he fooled
everybody, okay?

1456
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:56,686
He seemed like
the perfect guy.

1457
01:17:56,753 --> 01:18:01,724
Maybe I just wanted
him to be perfect so bad that...

1458
01:18:01,792 --> 01:18:04,460
I only saw
what I wanted to see.

1459
01:18:11,401 --> 01:18:13,669
[crying]
I loved him so much.

1460
01:18:13,737 --> 01:18:15,371
It's all right.

1461
01:18:18,275 --> 01:18:21,043
He made me feel like
no one every made me feel.

1462
01:18:24,214 --> 01:18:25,715
Come here.

1463
01:18:25,782 --> 01:18:27,316
I'm right here.

1464
01:18:36,026 --> 01:18:37,760
Number four.

1465
01:18:51,608 --> 01:18:54,443
Did you get my suit
back from the tailor?

1466
01:18:54,511 --> 01:18:56,078
He was going to fix the--

1467
01:18:56,146 --> 01:18:58,047
the button thing
in my cuff.

1468
01:18:58,115 --> 01:18:59,582
Philip, stop.

1469
01:19:01,785 --> 01:19:03,652
The wedding's only
a couple of weeks away now.

1470
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,187
Stop it!

1471
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:11,694
I came here today
because...

1472
01:19:14,631 --> 01:19:16,298
I need you to look me
in my eyes

1473
01:19:16,366 --> 01:19:18,234
and tell me the truth.

1474
01:19:18,301 --> 01:19:20,436
Can you do that, Philip?

1475
01:19:22,906 --> 01:19:24,473
Please?

1476
01:19:33,283 --> 01:19:36,152
I love you.
I always will.

1477
01:19:36,219 --> 01:19:38,254
Please, just tell me.

1478
01:19:39,956 --> 01:19:41,590
Please?

1479
01:19:43,427 --> 01:19:45,094
Maybe--

1480
01:19:48,465 --> 01:19:50,766
Maybe--

1481
01:19:50,834 --> 01:19:53,335
the person who
did this, maybe...

1482
01:19:56,339 --> 01:19:58,207
they didn't feel
like they deserved

1483
01:19:58,275 --> 01:20:00,042
all that they had.

1484
01:20:01,645 --> 01:20:03,479
Maybe they didn't feel
like they deserved

1485
01:20:03,547 --> 01:20:05,214
someone as amazing
as you.

1486
01:20:06,683 --> 01:20:08,784
You're amazing.

1487
01:20:08,852 --> 01:20:10,719
I love you.

1488
01:20:13,156 --> 01:20:15,124
Maybe...

1489
01:20:18,829 --> 01:20:20,796
they felt like
all they deserved

1490
01:20:20,864 --> 01:20:22,665
was to be punished.

1491
01:20:40,183 --> 01:20:42,485
I saw a picture
of the gun.

1492
01:20:45,322 --> 01:20:47,756
And the underwear that you
put under the mattress.

1493
01:20:49,893 --> 01:20:51,694
[crying]
<i>Our </i> mattress.

1494
01:20:55,599 --> 01:20:57,867
How many girls
were there?

1495
01:20:57,934 --> 01:21:00,369
16? Did you--

1496
01:21:00,437 --> 01:21:02,771
Were you safe?
Do I need to get tested?

1497
01:21:02,839 --> 01:21:06,742
I mean, getting tested
is a smart policy for anybody.

1498
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:08,177
Please don't do that.

1499
01:21:11,982 --> 01:21:13,716
It said on your site
that--

1500
01:21:15,585 --> 01:21:18,120
that you were into
bondage and...

1501
01:21:18,188 --> 01:21:20,422
cross-dressing.
Did you do that stuff?

1502
01:21:20,490 --> 01:21:23,826
Megan, sweetheart,
you can't...

1503
01:21:23,894 --> 01:21:26,462
believe everything you see
on the internet, you know?

1504
01:21:26,530 --> 01:21:27,997
This whole time.

1505
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:31,567
You've been lying to me
this whole time?

1506
01:21:31,635 --> 01:21:34,336
You've been looking in
my eyes and lying to me?

1507
01:21:34,404 --> 01:21:35,838
I mean, what did I do?

1508
01:21:35,906 --> 01:21:37,506
What did I do
to deserve this?

1509
01:21:37,574 --> 01:21:40,209
What--
What did I do?

1510
01:21:40,277 --> 01:21:41,677
I'm done here!

1511
01:21:41,745 --> 01:21:43,712
No, no. Megan, baby.
Baby, baby--

1512
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:45,881
Baby! Baby, baby,
please come back! Please!

1513
01:21:45,949 --> 01:21:48,884
I'm scared! I'm scared
to death in here. Please don't.

1514
01:21:48,952 --> 01:21:51,220
[crying]
Please. Please don't--

1515
01:21:54,824 --> 01:21:56,425
Please.

1516
01:22:02,999 --> 01:22:05,034
I'm never going
to see you again.

1517
01:22:10,206 --> 01:22:12,408
