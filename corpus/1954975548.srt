1
00:00:03,923 --> 00:00:08,615
Best of the Best 4
Without Warning

2
00:02:23,415 --> 00:02:26,058
remain Stand. Open the coolers.

3
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,071
Walk on.

4
00:02:55,114 --> 00:02:55,834
Lunch is here.

5
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:56,999
Anyone hungry?
- Hell Yeah.

6
00:02:57,513 --> 00:02:58,557
How is here.

7
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:05,072
We have sandwiches.
- With ham and eggs.

8
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:11,394
Motherfuckers, get down!
- Right now!

9
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:42,817
All units!
Rushed to the station, code red!

10
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:21,241
I'm ready!

11
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,426
Perfect!

12
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,230
Continue!

13
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:45,848
Traffic, sign up!

14
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:52,012
Traffic lights are on tilt!
What's going on?

15
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:25,905
Car 211. Runners are hurt!

16
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,719
We are being attacked!
Do you hear me!

17
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,384
Car
211. We can not come.

18
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:38,465
All units to Union Station.
You will hear from us!

19
00:07:15,707 --> 00:07:16,846
Lights on!

20
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:36,444
Open!

21
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,594
Beautiful!

22
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,271
That's settled then!

23
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:07,041
Come on!
Find it!

24
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:13,328
Okay.

25
00:09:16,357 --> 00:09:19,082
WARNING.
US GOVERNMENT PROPERTY.

26
00:09:32,668 --> 00:09:36,171
WE TRUST IN GOD.

27
00:09:39,607 --> 00:09:42,183
American secrets.

28
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,310
My god!

29
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:46,855
Thanks.

30
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:51,191
Can I get what I want?
- Almost everything.

31
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,601
I want a monkey.
- You already have one.

32
00:09:56,082 --> 00:10:00,705
A real monkey.
- Want no pop or something?

33
00:10:01,022 --> 00:10:04,926
I know! I want a cake
have that mommy made last time.

34
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:07,863
With Coconut over it.
- I think I can make.

35
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:11,558
I want you to make it.
And do not buy. Promised?

36
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:13,836
Promised.

37
00:10:14,082 --> 00:10:19,373
But under one condition.
I make him if I can carry it to the monkey.

38
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:22,412
You're the monkey!
- I'll get you! I'll get you!

39
00:10:27,736 --> 00:10:29,963
You have to go now!
- See you monkey.

40
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:31,424
Prima.

41
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:43,023
Dad... - Yes, honey.

42
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:47,499
Can I give this to Mom?
That makes her happy.

43
00:11:20,037 --> 00:11:23,819
Do you see the blue and red fibers?
- For Sure.

44
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,364
Left brand lines.

45
00:11:27,707 --> 00:11:31,934
The micro code from the collar
Franklin.

46
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,042
Everything is there.

47
00:11:36,314 --> 00:11:40,290
But... This is waterproof.

48
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:46,766
This is in fact not a counterfeit.
The disc is really

49
00:11:47,854 --> 00:11:50,063
paper is also real.

50
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:53,958
Why take a risk to make false

51
00:11:54,561 --> 00:11:59,526
while with the proper resources
you can make real bills?

52
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:03,636
Give it a try!

53
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,282
Give me that money.

54
00:12:10,321 --> 00:12:14,404
If the suspected weapons against
you use ..

55
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:18,692
let him kneel down and shoot him down.

56
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,605
The reason the police have hired me

57
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,973
is to improve your technique

58
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:31,259
and defend yourself without using your
weapon.

59
00:12:31,702 --> 00:12:33,938
I show an example.
Sit down.

60
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:44,534
As someone with a knife attack
then you have more choices.

61
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:47,105
Go turned left standing.

62
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:58,454
Take the knife... or...

63
00:12:59,101 --> 00:13:01,235
stand right reversed.

64
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,260
Calm down, calm down...

65
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:20,361
Good.

66
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,734
Moment that knife back suits him.
Okay, go up again.

67
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:35,535
Wait there.

68
00:13:38,544 --> 00:13:43,237
Without shoes and definitely not smoking.
- I'm afraid so.

69
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,046
Smoking can kill.
- What do you mean by that?

70
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:55,523
May I interrupt just to talk to my size.

71
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:08,723
Take it easy.
Why do you do so? He is our instructor.

72
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,811
They're dead.

73
00:14:14,935 --> 00:14:17,829
From the paper transport?
- Right.

74
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:19,157
Now fall.

75
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:27,218
What we do?
Think first. We'll talk later.

76
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:28,330
Is good.

77
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:34,094
Do not worry, son.
I was also a rookie.

78
00:14:34,703 --> 00:14:36,564
And now look what I've become.

79
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:41,186
Detective?

80
00:14:42,176 --> 00:14:44,520
Will not you join again?

81
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:47,196
Is good.

82
00:14:48,206 --> 00:14:52,729
Suppose I myself play.

83
00:14:53,341 --> 00:14:58,651
And you're a homeless cockroach.
This is not so difficult, right?

84
00:15:07,582 --> 00:15:10,421
If I wanted then you were already dead.

85
00:15:10,846 --> 00:15:12,998
Yes, but you would now sing soprano.

86
00:15:19,316 --> 00:15:21,609
If I wanted this.

87
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:34,082
Listen heroes.
Learn this nonsense but...

88
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:40,540
Remember one thing:
The criminals have guns.

89
00:15:41,886 --> 00:15:46,201
We use weapons.
End.

90
00:15:58,523 --> 00:16:01,168
Lucas, father would be proud of us.

91
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:07,198
I know, brother.

92
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:11,203
Let's look at the new penny.
- Good.

93
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:16,676
Put everything quietly and take a break.

94
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:50,302
Sara, they pay a lot of money,
but I can not go through here.

95
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,969
What should I do?

96
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,442
Mickey, get me the disc
and I bring him to justice.

97
00:16:56,163 --> 00:16:57,780
But be careful!

98
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,640
Where are you going Mickey?

99
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,398
I break now.
I want some food.

100
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,357
No one may leave the premises.

101
00:17:09,785 --> 00:17:11,091
Vertouw not you know me?

102
00:17:12,736 --> 00:17:14,772
You can search me.

103
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:44,069
Boris, give me some peace.

104
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,287
20 minutes.

105
00:17:58,424 --> 00:18:02,124
Listen Jack, I want your friend
not thwart but...

106
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:05,280
how a guy like him
become a cop?

107
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:06,354
My friend...

108
00:18:06,356 --> 00:18:08,906
No, I can not call him my friend.
Partner... yes.

109
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:11,705
Friend no. Actually, I think
that he has no friends.

110
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:13,350
Do you think really?

111
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:14,991
Tommy, he's a good cop.

112
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:19,832
I have to admit he's an outsider.
He is therefore a A.O.D.

113
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:22,209
What is A.O.D.?
Arogante vulgar droplul.

114
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,051
He treats everyone as waste.

115
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,643
Sara! Where are you?

116
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:35,662
Hi, Sara.
You know what you must record.

117
00:18:35,964 --> 00:18:39,044
The name, number, shoe size ..
- Please take in!

118
00:18:39,363 --> 00:18:41,650
Quick, quick, quick!
Damn It!

119
00:18:42,276 --> 00:18:43,319
Hello!

120
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:44,953
Hello!

121
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,693
Hi, Jules!

122
00:18:54,727 --> 00:18:59,204
Jules, I can this thing just robbery
without you noticing!

123
00:18:59,907 --> 00:19:01,263
I know where you live Tommy!

124
00:19:02,152 --> 00:19:05,829
And I have a gun under the counter
in case.

125
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:07,258
I'm afraid of!

126
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:09,364
What do you want?

127
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,001
I want advice.

128
00:19:13,634 --> 00:19:15,094
Women!
Treat them tenderly!

129
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:17,106
No women.
Good.

130
00:19:17,743 --> 00:19:18,994
Gamble than in Dallas.

131
00:19:20,812 --> 00:19:21,854
Hello.

132
00:19:25,252 --> 00:19:26,295
Jules.

133
00:19:26,838 --> 00:19:29,193
I want to know how to make a cake.

134
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:39,261
Butter, sugar, flour, eggs,
mixes it, you cook it and eat it.

135
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:41,319
Is that all?
That's all.

136
00:19:42,372 --> 00:19:43,623
Thank you Jules.

137
00:19:56,922 --> 00:19:58,173
Oh my god!

138
00:19:58,503 --> 00:19:59,545
I have it!

139
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:05,901
Wait!
Stop!

140
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:08,154
Sorry Jules.

141
00:20:09,194 --> 00:20:11,280
I need Coconut.

142
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,882
Third hallway left.

143
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,505
Here are the coconuts.

144
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:27,180
And who might this cake
be?

145
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,162
For Stephanie.

146
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,519
How old she is. Five?
- Six.

147
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:34,716
Six years?

148
00:21:36,197 --> 00:21:40,083
Enjoy it while you can.
It can suddenly be over.

149
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,665
I do that too.
How's Mickey?

150
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:48,337
I'm worried.

151
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,723
Do not worry she's smart.

152
00:21:53,156 --> 00:21:55,199
That's right.
- Papa. Dad!

153
00:21:57,453 --> 00:21:59,730
Daddy, help me!
- What is it?

154
00:22:01,148 --> 00:22:03,416
Mickey, Mickey, quiet.
What is up?

155
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,013
Oh my god!

156
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:12,877
Thunder Jet on here.

157
00:22:15,302 --> 00:22:16,345
Dad!

158
00:22:17,613 --> 00:22:21,077
Do you also want the Heroism
like your fat friend?

159
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,615
She's a bad girl!
She ran away!

160
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,471
Or not then, huh?

161
00:22:27,657 --> 00:22:30,221
Please. Let them do my pain.

162
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:32,485
Alseblieft no!

163
00:22:39,635 --> 00:22:40,678
Dad!

164
00:23:50,185 --> 00:23:52,672
Jules!
Mickey, call the police!

165
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:55,648
Jules, talk to me!

166
00:23:56,473 --> 00:23:59,099
Tommy, I can not call the police.
I am involved!

167
00:23:59,801 --> 00:24:00,844
What?

168
00:24:03,254 --> 00:24:05,223
No, stay down!
Stay with your father.

169
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:06,788
Tommy, no!

170
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:33,163
Dad!

171
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:36,573
My god!

172
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:38,154
Mickey!
Mickey!

173
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:40,868
I go get help!
Yes, yes, it is good!

174
00:24:42,737 --> 00:24:46,552
Mickey! Mickey!
Oh my God!

175
00:24:50,321 --> 00:24:52,407
Let her go, Jules!
No!

176
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:11,050
Did she give something? Anything?
- No, nothing!

177
00:25:12,338 --> 00:25:16,924
That's what you are, nothing.
- Why are you such an asshole?

178
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,445
Motherfucker? Let me make clear what
Azieër, I'm the good one.

179
00:25:20,865 --> 00:25:24,846
I give help. I protect.
That's my job.

180
00:25:25,861 --> 00:25:29,259
I've been doing this long enough.
Make you're gone.

181
00:25:35,482 --> 00:25:37,880
Tommy, how is it? he comes on top?
- Yup.

182
00:25:39,114 --> 00:25:41,305
Go home and try to rest.

183
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:44,100
We will contact you when we know more
, right?

184
00:25:44,746 --> 00:25:46,623
Let me know.
- Is good.

185
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:50,404
Throw!

186
00:25:54,242 --> 00:25:55,285
Throw!

187
00:25:58,183 --> 00:25:59,226
Throw!

188
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,213
Throw!

189
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,103
Throw!

190
00:26:22,058 --> 00:26:23,101
Mr. Slava...

191
00:26:25,253 --> 00:26:26,296
Did you get it?

192
00:26:28,744 --> 00:26:30,934
There were some problems.
- Throwing!

193
00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:34,432
There was this guy...

194
00:26:35,322 --> 00:26:38,412
One guy has you stopped
for what I asked you?

195
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:45,523
Do you know how me this every hour
will cost by the failure of you?

196
00:26:47,262 --> 00:26:49,724
It does not happen anymore.
- I agree.

197
00:26:50,897 --> 00:26:51,940
Absolutely agree.

198
00:27:02,104 --> 00:27:05,893
I swear I recall it!
- I believe Boris.

199
00:27:08,072 --> 00:27:09,740
And now gone!
Thank you, sir.

200
00:27:10,006 --> 00:27:11,049
Have you heard?
Go!

201
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:15,171
Sir, I am very grateful.

202
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:23,922
I would have slain him.
- That you certainly did.

203
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,478
That would have been wrong.

204
00:27:28,112 --> 00:27:33,240
Scare A man is easy.
Anyone can do that.

205
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:38,371
But to trust to forgive his mistakes and him

206
00:27:39,315 --> 00:27:42,192
he will keep you always faithful.

207
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:28,676
You, me and dad in a big house.

208
00:28:30,593 --> 00:28:33,782
Trees, horses and monkeys!

209
00:28:35,635 --> 00:28:41,629
Guess where dad now works!
Do not you know it? He is going to make a cake.

210
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:48,314
As you made that ..
Studded with coconut on top.

211
00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:00,738
Just look at your goal
and you achieved success.

212
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:06,187
Super!

213
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,153
That's not bad.
He is slightly off to the left.

214
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:12,169
I will arise it.

215
00:29:24,231 --> 00:29:25,274
The five.

216
00:29:32,347 --> 00:29:33,390
What's his name?

217
00:29:38,537 --> 00:29:39,579
The three.

218
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:49,902
What's his name?

219
00:30:02,622 --> 00:30:06,995
Why do you put your life on the line
and tell you his name?

220
00:30:09,665 --> 00:30:12,200
You bastard, you killed my daughter.

221
00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:17,441
I tell you anything.

222
00:30:20,356 --> 00:30:22,404
Damn say his name.

223
00:30:23,453 --> 00:30:24,655
His name is Tommy Lee.

224
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,060
I have spoken with the indicator of the
police.

225
00:30:34,831 --> 00:30:36,708
Slim done Boris.
Great.

226
00:30:42,343 --> 00:30:46,907
You see Yuri?
That's what I mean.

227
00:30:47,504 --> 00:30:50,064
Take an example here.

228
00:30:53,078 --> 00:30:54,121
Thanks

229
00:31:09,593 --> 00:31:10,636
Four.

230
00:31:15,378 --> 00:31:18,359
The best chefs are men.

231
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:20,381
Not true.
- Did not you know?

232
00:31:24,878 --> 00:31:26,442
Do they know themselves then?
- Very funny.

233
00:31:29,865 --> 00:31:31,951
Would you prefer a banana than a cake.
- No!

234
00:31:33,095 --> 00:31:34,138
Would you like that?

235
00:31:34,481 --> 00:31:35,854
Daddy are you weird.
- Yet some paper.

236
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:39,478
Do this in the bin.

237
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:41,178
Trash... Trash...

238
00:31:43,016 --> 00:31:46,471
This should be in the basket...
go with three seconds left...

239
00:31:47,556 --> 00:31:50,016
Will he score?
- He's going to score!

240
00:31:50,894 --> 00:31:52,458
Three! Two! One! He throws.

241
00:31:54,724 --> 00:31:58,080
Yes.
And scored!

242
00:32:05,172 --> 00:32:07,049
I open it!
- Sweetheart, ask first, OK?

243
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:09,710
Who is that?

244
00:32:14,499 --> 00:32:15,959
Sorry girl,
is your mum or dad home?

245
00:32:17,242 --> 00:32:18,285
Dad!

246
00:32:19,906 --> 00:32:22,157
Yes.
What is up?

247
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,903
Hello.

248
00:32:24,312 --> 00:32:28,097
I'm a collector.
Do you have a gift for the poor?

249
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:31,344
Honey, you can take a dollar from my wallet
?

250
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:32,745
Is good Dad.

251
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:35,430
I make the chain loose, okay?

252
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:39,897
Course. You can not be too careful.
The whole society has become unsafe.

253
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:52,122
Dad?

254
00:32:56,797 --> 00:32:57,840
Daddy, I'm scared!

255
00:34:41,157 --> 00:34:42,513
Alex.

256
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:44,824
Hey!

257
00:35:38,684 --> 00:35:40,457
What do you want from me?
Give me the disc!

258
00:35:42,054 --> 00:35:45,931
I think you're in the wrong.
I do not know what you mean.

259
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,157
Stephanie?

260
00:36:29,275 --> 00:36:31,542
Dad... Baby!

261
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:39,813
Let's go!

262
00:36:43,937 --> 00:36:45,761
Daddy, the keys.

263
00:36:58,014 --> 00:36:59,843
What is it?

264
00:37:00,934 --> 00:37:02,168
There's nothing!

265
00:37:03,672 --> 00:37:06,339
Nothing to worry about.
We go.

266
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:08,876
Daddy, my monkey.

267
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:26,020
Is there nothing?
No music?

268
00:37:27,535 --> 00:37:30,244
I do not think so.
I'm going to call.

269
00:37:30,246 --> 00:37:31,922
Good.

270
00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:49,563
Hello Sara.
You know what to omit.

271
00:37:49,817 --> 00:37:51,384
Name, number, shoe size...

272
00:37:52,342 --> 00:37:53,070
Speak after the beep.

273
00:38:09,143 --> 00:38:11,245
Why did you not tell us before?

274
00:38:11,669 --> 00:38:13,372
I knew nothing about this band.

275
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:16,867
The only thing I wanted to do was make a cake
.

276
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:23,734
Does anyone else here?

277
00:38:23,741 --> 00:38:26,110
No. But there is one thing.

278
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:32,041
Vordat Mickey died, she said the
police can not be trusted.

279
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:33,745
What does she say that?

280
00:38:35,795 --> 00:38:37,672
Have you heard about the robbery?
The transport.

281
00:38:38,162 --> 00:38:40,151
They were paper or something to carry.

282
00:38:40,257 --> 00:38:41,151
True. But...

283
00:38:43,668 --> 00:38:46,394
They say it was set
by the police.

284
00:38:46,396 --> 00:38:48,757
You also know by whom?
- Yup.

285
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:52,021
I can not tell you, Tommy.
This is a police matter.

286
00:38:52,024 --> 00:38:54,978
Police Case?
We are bombarded tonight!

287
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,098
And someone who knew as a child
is now dead.

288
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:00,898
And you can not speak to me
say about this?

289
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:03,387
Who do you protect Jack?

290
00:39:03,389 --> 00:39:05,837
Tommy, your friend was killed today.

291
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:09,220
If a corrupt cop is involved
and has been in your apartment...

292
00:39:09,222 --> 00:39:11,980
What are you saying?
- It is my responsibility

293
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,016
and I will get him.

294
00:39:15,765 --> 00:39:17,380
Gresco?

295
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:20,566
It is Gresco right?
- Damn It.

296
00:39:24,566 --> 00:39:29,738
As I said... I'll handle this.

297
00:39:33,387 --> 00:39:35,369
You're a good guy, Jack.

298
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:39,512
Why I wear a badge.

299
00:39:41,271 --> 00:39:44,678
Listen you need a shelter
until this is over.

300
00:39:45,379 --> 00:39:47,546
I have place in me.
- No, I do not want to be a burden.

301
00:39:47,674 --> 00:39:50,475
What do you mean?
Come to friend.

302
00:39:50,906 --> 00:39:52,241
Where else do you have friends?

303
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,193
He shot him.

304
00:40:26,778 --> 00:40:31,219
Dad, what was that sound?
Nothing to worry about. Go to sleep.

305
00:41:05,152 --> 00:41:05,914
Father Gil!

306
00:41:10,522 --> 00:41:13,901
Tommy?
- Father.

307
00:41:13,909 --> 00:41:15,074
I must speak to you.

308
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:19,370
Detective Gresco,
it just came.

309
00:41:23,077 --> 00:41:25,298
Are you sure?
It's all right.

310
00:41:28,301 --> 00:41:29,933
Thanks.

311
00:41:43,526 --> 00:41:44,542
I will not be long.

312
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:48,343
Meanwhile, as long as you stay with Father Gil.

313
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:52,754
I do not want you to go.
- Honey, I want either.

314
00:41:53,286 --> 00:41:56,319
But I need to know who the bad guys were
who were in our house.

315
00:41:56,868 --> 00:41:59,006
And if something happens to you?

316
00:42:02,073 --> 00:42:05,104
Nothing will happen.
- Promise?

317
00:42:06,795 --> 00:42:09,660
Promised! Give me a hug!

318
00:42:13,787 --> 00:42:15,490
Dad, I can not breathe.

319
00:42:18,777 --> 00:42:19,804
Sorry.

320
00:42:25,758 --> 00:42:27,300
Father...

321
00:42:27,458 --> 00:42:29,404
Take care of yourself.
God bless you.

322
00:42:30,268 --> 00:42:32,540
Gentlemen, be extremely careful!

323
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:36,231
Bring me this cockroach!

324
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:38,742
That is all.

325
00:42:45,755 --> 00:42:47,088
Hey, Detective Gresco.

326
00:42:48,986 --> 00:42:52,809
I can not believe that Tommy Lee.
This is nonsense.

327
00:42:56,009 --> 00:42:59,077
Listen rookie. Jack and I were already
15 years in the police.

328
00:42:59,097 --> 00:43:02,440
You were then masturbating
on a women.

329
00:43:03,152 --> 00:43:06,286
Lee is as guilty as what I get him!

330
00:43:06,856 --> 00:43:07,768
Stop Gresco!

331
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,822
Hey!
- Jesus!

332
00:43:12,563 --> 00:43:14,250
Think you can handle it?
- Yup.

333
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:20,831
He killed one of us.

334
00:43:22,881 --> 00:43:24,399
What more could you want?

335
00:44:07,116 --> 00:44:07,832
I have the...

336
00:44:10,672 --> 00:44:13,380
What?
- You Bastard!

337
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:18,062
How dare you to throw at me?
Come here!

338
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:19,148
Stay away from me!

339
00:44:19,786 --> 00:44:21,105
You're hurting me!

340
00:44:22,028 --> 00:44:27,963
Remember. Without me you have nothing.
No car, no clothes, no money.

341
00:44:31,204 --> 00:44:32,455
Understood?

342
00:44:36,314 --> 00:44:37,096
Pick that up!

343
00:44:41,729 --> 00:44:43,596
I'm taking!

344
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,071
What is this?

345
00:45:10,412 --> 00:45:11,844
Drained cell phone numbers.

346
00:45:12,988 --> 00:45:14,388
I know who Mickey rang!

347
00:45:18,233 --> 00:45:19,611
Well done!

348
00:45:23,968 --> 00:45:24,698
My dearest.

349
00:45:27,722 --> 00:45:28,718
You may go.

350
00:45:34,188 --> 00:45:35,790
Karina!

351
00:45:38,932 --> 00:45:43,649
Do not forget to close the door.
As you know I'm a little shy....

352
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,654
Hello?
- Sara?

353
00:46:06,503 --> 00:46:08,849
How could it?
- Mickey?

354
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:12,239
We had a room together.

355
00:46:16,097 --> 00:46:17,854
When was the last time you spoke?

356
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:31,099
That was yesterday. They had to talk me
because it was very urgent.

357
00:46:32,384 --> 00:46:34,867
They never came.

358
00:46:46,102 --> 00:46:47,805
How did you find me?

359
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:50,640
I found something with you
name and number.

360
00:46:51,014 --> 00:46:52,056
Something?

361
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:32,974
Stop!

362
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:40,716
Go on, shoot!

363
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:44,628
Are you involved?
- What are you talking about?

364
00:47:45,193 --> 00:47:47,144
The raid on transportation.

365
00:47:47,454 --> 00:47:48,533
I asked if you're involved.

366
00:47:50,791 --> 00:47:52,354
Drop dead!

367
00:48:17,486 --> 00:48:19,181
Get in!

368
00:48:24,681 --> 00:48:25,434
Stop!

369
00:48:40,114 --> 00:48:42,993
Father, I think I have proof.

370
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,570
Detective Gresco was here yesterday.
He looked for you.

371
00:48:48,622 --> 00:48:50,015
And?
What did he do?

372
00:48:50,665 --> 00:48:53,516
He gave me his card and had
call him if I saw you.

373
00:48:53,728 --> 00:48:57,592
How is Stephanie?
- He has seen her but said nothing.

374
00:48:59,174 --> 00:49:00,634
She really misses you, Tommy!

375
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:04,024
Can I speak to her please?

376
00:49:04,717 --> 00:49:06,758
Of course, she's here.
It's your Dad.

377
00:49:07,195 --> 00:49:09,528
Dad!
Hello Stephanie!

378
00:49:10,157 --> 00:49:12,156
When are you coming home?

379
00:49:12,482 --> 00:49:14,197
Quick sweetheart, fast...

380
00:49:14,523 --> 00:49:19,767
You forgot my birthday is it?
- No, of course not!

381
00:49:19,837 --> 00:49:23,188
I think every time that.
- You know why?

382
00:49:23,581 --> 00:49:26,690
Why?
- A promise is a promise.

383
00:49:26,796 --> 00:49:28,172
Yet?
- Yup.

384
00:49:30,464 --> 00:49:32,650
Dad?
- Yes, sweetheart.

385
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:35,305
Are you in trouble?

386
00:49:36,618 --> 00:49:40,683
Stephanie.
Do not worry.

387
00:49:41,998 --> 00:49:44,663
It takes time,
but everything will be fine.

388
00:49:46,076 --> 00:49:49,073
I love you.
- I love you too, Dad.

389
00:49:49,651 --> 00:49:51,528
Day monkey.
- Bye Now.

390
00:49:52,834 --> 00:49:53,877
Thank you.

391
00:50:01,146 --> 00:50:02,502
Detective Gresco...

392
00:50:04,407 --> 00:50:05,867
I think we have something.

393
00:50:07,594 --> 00:50:09,679
Quick! Hurry up!

394
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:12,835
Tempo!

395
00:50:15,988 --> 00:50:17,552
I have coffee.

396
00:50:18,475 --> 00:50:19,831
Thanks.

397
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:24,534
Sugar is in the bag.
- That is fine.

398
00:50:33,538 --> 00:50:36,163
You said Mickey gave something to
you with my name on it.

399
00:50:36,656 --> 00:50:37,806
What was that?

400
00:50:42,753 --> 00:50:45,741
A band.
- Can I see it?

401
00:50:48,172 --> 00:50:50,136
You're bleeding.
- What?

402
00:50:51,717 --> 00:50:52,956
Your shoulder...

403
00:50:56,005 --> 00:50:57,465
Sure to cut the glass.

404
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:35,168
Are you always so worried?

405
00:51:51,281 --> 00:51:54,838
She is very beautiful.
- She's everything to me.

406
00:52:00,168 --> 00:52:02,628
In due time I will have
children.

407
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:46,108
What is it?

408
00:53:09,876 --> 00:53:10,919
Inside! Forward!

409
00:53:19,233 --> 00:53:20,275
Damn!

410
00:53:27,803 --> 00:53:28,846
Sarah?

411
00:53:30,202 --> 00:53:31,303
Sara is dead.

412
00:53:39,213 --> 00:53:40,047
Why?

413
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,660
Because we paid her a lot,
Mr. Lee.

414
00:53:43,916 --> 00:53:47,405
In fact overpaid, she
made too many mistakes, Karina.

415
00:53:48,398 --> 00:53:50,159
He does not have the disc.

416
00:53:51,794 --> 00:53:54,137
I knew you would fail if you
we could trust.

417
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,480
He said he had him.

418
00:53:58,883 --> 00:53:59,926
And you believed that?

419
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:02,906
Yes.

420
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:14,231
Stupid bitch!
- Why do not you leave her alone?

421
00:54:15,546 --> 00:54:19,494
What?
- I told you to leave her alone.

422
00:54:20,326 --> 00:54:25,406
He is crazy about you Karina.
The woman who has cheated you.

423
00:54:27,012 --> 00:54:30,561
That's almost poetry.
I like that.

424
00:54:35,206 --> 00:54:36,249
No!

425
00:54:38,217 --> 00:54:39,259
Yuri!

426
00:54:49,878 --> 00:54:54,220
Here. Are you going to refresh!

427
00:55:02,246 --> 00:55:04,984
You're a brave man, Lee.
Do you want to end up like this?

428
00:55:08,682 --> 00:55:11,780
By thwart me.
- No, I want my life back.

429
00:55:14,556 --> 00:55:16,283
That's an honest answer.

430
00:55:16,603 --> 00:55:18,048
You know what I want.

431
00:55:18,304 --> 00:55:21,284
I want to continue with my plan
I am working a while with

432
00:55:21,704 --> 00:55:26,346
but I think you have something
what I needed.

433
00:55:27,486 --> 00:55:28,986
I'd like to help...
- Give us the disk.

434
00:55:30,154 --> 00:55:31,405
Let me finish!

435
00:55:36,884 --> 00:55:41,214
I'll leave you alone with my brother
he can continue playing.

436
00:55:41,616 --> 00:55:46,793
You two look alike.
It pleases you to hurt people.

437
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:50,230
But I must admit that Yuri
will enjoy it more.

438
00:55:51,947 --> 00:55:56,604
Goodbye Mr. Lee. If I do not see you,
then it was my pleasure.

439
00:56:00,684 --> 00:56:02,144
Stay with them.

440
00:56:09,442 --> 00:56:12,049
You know what I want. So talk.

441
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:14,939
Go look for yourself.

442
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:45,209
Stephanie!

443
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:03,693
Stephanie!

444
00:57:17,411 --> 00:57:21,541
Hello mom. I know you're busy,
but I want to ask you a favor.

445
00:57:22,864 --> 00:57:25,521
I want you to ask God to help Dad.

446
00:57:28,573 --> 00:57:31,085
I do not ask,
but he has problems.

447
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:38,708
Usually he can arrange everything myself.

448
00:57:41,941 --> 00:57:44,572
But I think he could use
extra help.

449
00:57:55,921 --> 00:58:01,382
That's all I think.
I love you mom.

450
00:58:11,231 --> 00:58:13,137
Should I really believe that crap?

451
00:58:14,643 --> 00:58:16,456
Is this all worth it?

452
00:58:30,664 --> 00:58:33,279
Boris, keep an eye on him.

453
00:58:34,537 --> 00:58:35,722
I take a shower.

454
00:58:43,173 --> 00:58:44,215
What happened?

455
00:58:44,766 --> 00:58:49,346
The disc is somewhere in a phone booth
if he does not lie.

456
00:58:54,232 --> 00:58:56,631
Well done.

457
00:58:57,759 --> 00:58:59,680
About one hour I have the disc.

458
00:58:59,939 --> 00:59:01,538
Good.

459
01:00:38,629 --> 01:00:40,727
Sorry friend,
I am in a hurry.

460
01:00:42,479 --> 01:00:44,042
I did not know! Pardon Me!

461
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:56,417
Goddamn!

462
01:01:09,687 --> 01:01:10,729
Nothing.

463
01:01:36,774 --> 01:01:37,816
Find him!

464
01:02:07,202 --> 01:02:08,245
You!

465
01:02:21,383 --> 01:02:25,799
Listen, you do not have to hurt people.
- Why not?

466
01:02:29,615 --> 01:02:31,597
Maybe you get yourself tormented.

467
01:02:33,596 --> 01:02:35,456
No! He's mine.

468
01:05:42,070 --> 01:05:43,113
Get out of here!

469
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:04,669
Tempo!

470
01:06:48,974 --> 01:06:51,260
I see him!
Eropaf.

471
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:31,176
He goes to the north.

472
01:07:38,016 --> 01:07:39,508
Go to the tunnel exit.

473
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:03,746
Down.

474
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:27,945
What is it?

475
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:41,514
You can not drive yet, jerk.

476
01:09:10,322 --> 01:09:12,365
I'm in the tunnel.

477
01:09:13,609 --> 01:09:16,118
Boss, I can not hear you.
The connection is gone.

478
01:10:29,752 --> 01:10:33,588
Mrs. Jones, can you bring me the complete file
Jack Jarvings?

479
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:35,428
Yes sir.

480
01:10:44,634 --> 01:10:45,960
Hello.
- Father Gil.

481
01:10:47,071 --> 01:10:48,348
Can I please speak Stephanie?

482
01:10:51,883 --> 01:10:54,452
I'm afraid your daughter busy
with her last prayer.

483
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:58,134
Whether you have come to bring the disk.
By Yourself!

484
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:02,379
If you're doing to her what I'll kill you.
Do you understand!

485
01:11:07,468 --> 01:11:09,580
Stephanie!
Stephanie!

486
01:11:13,705 --> 01:11:14,747
Where is my daughter?

487
01:11:18,589 --> 01:11:19,944
Slow down Lee.

488
01:11:23,381 --> 01:11:24,736
Where is she?

489
01:11:28,394 --> 01:11:30,503
Go on. Hit me!

490
01:11:31,832 --> 01:11:33,571
Your daughter the rest of her life will

491
01:11:34,386 --> 01:11:36,253
try to forget the day
that her father was murdered.

492
01:11:38,673 --> 01:11:39,715
Karina!

493
01:11:41,329 --> 01:11:43,101
Dad!
Stephanie!

494
01:11:44,602 --> 01:11:46,139
Are you okay?
- She's okay.

495
01:11:46,792 --> 01:11:48,704
The disc!
- Do not hurt my Dad.

496
01:11:51,555 --> 01:11:52,731
Karina, shoot her.
- No!

497
01:11:55,497 --> 01:11:56,540
No.

498
01:11:58,887 --> 01:12:00,514
Honey, are you OK?

499
01:12:02,438 --> 01:12:05,726
Father.
I have to do this as well ?.

500
01:12:28,291 --> 01:12:29,334
Prima.

501
01:12:31,844 --> 01:12:33,423
Sweetheart.

502
01:12:40,595 --> 01:12:43,707
This is the house of God.
You can not make it here.

503
01:12:44,313 --> 01:12:45,539
We have still done it, old man.

504
01:12:55,084 --> 01:12:56,544
A last conversation with Lee.

505
01:13:00,104 --> 01:13:03,304
You have slain many innocents.
And for what?

506
01:13:04,433 --> 01:13:05,475
Greed?

507
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:11,623
You can call it greed
but I prefer to call it welfare.

508
01:13:14,155 --> 01:13:17,137
I leave you behind with your loved ones,
that was it.

509
01:13:17,675 --> 01:13:18,718
No!

510
01:13:19,012 --> 01:13:20,054
Our plane is waiting.

511
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:24,761
Thanks.

512
01:13:27,228 --> 01:13:28,270
Ilja.

513
01:13:32,444 --> 01:13:35,972
Make it look like an accident.
Nothing special...

514
01:13:37,034 --> 01:13:42,429
Open the gas valve,
explosion, fire... Something.

515
01:13:42,431 --> 01:13:48,288
And that little girl? - I told everyone.
So I meant everybody.

516
01:13:52,867 --> 01:13:54,401
Ilya!

517
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:02,611
When it is done you kill her too.

518
01:14:06,051 --> 01:14:07,094
Detective Gresco!

519
01:14:08,223 --> 01:14:09,266
Tell.

520
01:14:09,869 --> 01:14:13,638
I have inquired about Jack.
There is no paid into his account.

521
01:14:15,211 --> 01:14:17,054
There is something else.

522
01:14:17,925 --> 01:14:20,177
One hour after the raid on the paper transport

523
01:14:21,456 --> 01:14:24,542
there is $ 5000.000
deposited in the account of his daughter.

524
01:14:25,368 --> 01:14:26,494
The bastard.

525
01:14:28,533 --> 01:14:31,012
Is there anything wrong?
- He had no daughter!

526
01:14:35,038 --> 01:14:38,318
Karina, you kill my daughter?
- Shut up!

527
01:14:39,462 --> 01:14:41,774
She is only six years.
- I said shut up.

528
01:14:42,972 --> 01:14:46,894
Karina, Yuri was too good for you.
You can not even kill a child.

529
01:14:48,497 --> 01:14:52,132
You do not know me well enough, Ilya.
I have no problem with killing.

530
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:54,227
Karina, do not listen to him.

531
01:14:55,164 --> 01:14:57,263
Then do it, Karina,
Otherwise I'll do it!

532
01:14:58,033 --> 01:14:59,457
Karina, no!

533
01:15:13,578 --> 01:15:15,222
Tommy!

534
01:15:16,666 --> 01:15:21,628
I would never have hurt your daughter!

535
01:15:28,846 --> 01:15:29,889
Karina?

536
01:15:48,408 --> 01:15:49,451
Damn it, Jack!

537
01:15:51,396 --> 01:15:54,431
I hear the police.
Are they on your side?

538
01:15:56,224 --> 01:15:57,392
Not without the disc.

539
01:15:58,317 --> 01:15:59,360
Then go quickly.

540
01:16:00,389 --> 01:16:01,432
Care for her!

541
01:16:34,235 --> 01:16:38,296
He is to Long Beach airport.
He could use help.

542
01:16:39,138 --> 01:16:42,190
Sir, my dad has done nothing
do not hurt him.

543
01:16:44,381 --> 01:16:47,028
I know.
Do not worry. Okay?

544
01:17:26,610 --> 01:17:27,653
Finally home.

545
01:17:28,681 --> 01:17:29,724
Sure.

546
01:17:34,722 --> 01:17:35,765
The bastard.

547
01:17:39,189 --> 01:17:40,232
Annoying, eh?

548
01:17:40,937 --> 01:17:41,980
Yes.

549
01:17:42,946 --> 01:17:46,329
A proverb told: Never let a woman
get a male job.

550
01:18:04,113 --> 01:18:05,219
Shoot another through his head.

551
01:18:54,421 --> 01:18:55,881
Quick!

552
01:19:05,838 --> 01:19:09,226
I go once and for murder!

553
01:19:20,717 --> 01:19:21,760
Come on Yuri!

554
01:20:28,707 --> 01:20:30,404
The party is over!

555
01:20:45,544 --> 01:20:48,415
Stay down!
Let him go! I have him!

556
01:20:50,393 --> 01:20:53,008
You, on your belly! Right Now!

557
01:21:06,017 --> 01:21:08,156
First, the agent, and then you.

558
01:21:26,579 --> 01:21:28,215
Quick Yuri!

559
01:21:32,737 --> 01:21:34,301
Okay?
Yup.

560
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:40,391
Damn! They escape!

561
01:21:53,586 --> 01:21:55,026
Red you do it?
Does good.

562
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:19,122
It worked!

563
01:23:10,996 --> 01:23:12,769
No worries. We get it.

564
01:23:17,834 --> 01:23:19,294
One free throw
go with ten seconds.

565
01:23:21,519 --> 01:23:22,979
Ten, nine, eight...

566
01:23:35,149 --> 01:23:36,571
What he had in his hand?

567
01:23:41,887 --> 01:23:42,930
Shit!

568
01:23:54,677 --> 01:23:55,719
Game is out!

569
01:24:23,548 --> 01:24:24,279
Friend.

570
01:24:27,156 --> 01:24:28,257
I must apologize.

571
01:24:28,259 --> 01:24:31,689
Forget Gresco!
This is not your style!

572
01:24:32,453 --> 01:24:35,130
Yes, that's right.
I just did my job.

573
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:37,383
I know, yes.

574
01:24:39,269 --> 01:24:40,312
Say...

575
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:45,019
A guy like me, who can also teach those things
?

576
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:47,506
What things?

577
01:24:48,347 --> 01:24:51,887
You know, those things that you do so.

578
01:24:53,825 --> 01:24:56,604
Seriously. I am so serious that
I stop smoking.

579
01:24:57,296 --> 01:25:00,135
You stop smoking?
- Yes, I stop.

580
01:25:01,588 --> 01:25:03,486
You see that?
They are there for you.

581
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:07,838
Take good care of him.

582
01:25:08,262 --> 01:25:10,619
It's nothing.
- We are so attached.

583
01:25:13,591 --> 01:25:15,488
Hey, where you going?

584
01:25:18,295 --> 01:25:19,534
I have to make a cake!

585
01:25:31,568 --> 01:25:36,714
God, make my daughter Stephanie
grows to be a good person.

586
01:25:37,764 --> 01:25:40,563
And her life is full of love and joy.

587
01:25:41,168 --> 01:25:42,747
Amen!
- Amen!

588
01:25:43,414 --> 01:25:46,379
Are you ready?
One, two, three... Now!
