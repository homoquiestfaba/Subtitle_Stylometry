00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,054

00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:53,659
It's a very
bad hot virus.

164
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:55,260
It's not presently known
whether this is

165
00:09:55,293 --> 00:09:57,296
a natural outbreak
or a terrorist act.

166

Yes, sir.

And remember,
there is no vaccine.

There is no antidote.

There's no treatment
for Marburg.

00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,894
(<i> overlapping speaking</i> )

185
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:31,163
It's not doing us
any good sitting in
a lab in Aberdeen.

186
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:33,165
If they got one
that works, I
want it onboard.

187
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:34,867
What?

188
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,102
Yes, I'm here to see
Assistant Director Farrell.

189
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:38,804
What do you want me
to do?

190
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:40,339
You want me to spray the crap
out of a ship

191
00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:42,241
that's sitting two miles
out in the ocean?

192
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,175
Are you Sullivan?

193
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,175
Yes, sir.

194
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:48,047
Fine. Tell them I want
to get back to them.

195
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,915
Thank you.

196
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:52,818
Gentlemen, can we
have a couple of
minutes here, please?

197
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:58,290
Sir, when'd you want
to contact Mexico City?

198
00:10:58,323 --> 00:10:59,959
Soon as I'm done here.

199
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:05,698
MAN:
We also need to contact
the<i> Federales</i>

200
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,300
and make sure we're
on the same page...

201
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,137
Fraud, huh?

202
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,305
Yes, sir.

203
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:17,141
So you're probably not
too familiar

204
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:18,977
with weapons
of mass destruction?

205
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,148
Not unless you're referring
to HMOs.

206
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,387
Do you know this man?

207
00:11:29,387 --> 00:11:31,156
Uh, yes.

208
00:11:31,189 --> 00:11:33,492
It's my uncle... uh, Uncle John.

209
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:34,793
Are you close?

210
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:36,295
Uh, not really, no.

211
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:39,298
I haven't seem him in, uh...
well, a very long time.

212
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:40,999
Why is that?

213
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:42,334
My mother and my uncle
had a falling out

214
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:43,468
after my father died.

215
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,002
Did something happen to him?

216
00:11:45,036 --> 00:11:46,170
Yeah, he retired.

217
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:47,739
Oh. From the Army?

218
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,042
He lives on Bainbridge Island
off Seattle.

219
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,443
It's crucial that
we talk to him.

220
00:11:51,476 --> 00:11:52,444
About what?

221
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:54,446
Weaponization.

222
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:58,984
This is a microscopic particle
that the CDC took off the lung

223
00:11:59,017 --> 00:12:02,187
of one of the
passengers who died.

224
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,489
Question:

225
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:05,124
is the particle a weapon?

226
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,094
What do you need from my uncle?

227
00:12:10,128 --> 00:12:11,997
Don't you know who he is?

228
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,966
Apparently not.

229
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,968
Well... sweet ol' Uncle John

230
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,871
personally invented
most of this stuff.

231
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,241
He worked with the
Army's bio-weapons unit
in the '50s and '60s

232
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:24,309
until Nixon disbanded it in '68.

233
00:12:24,342 --> 00:12:26,879
We have a generation gap
of knowledge.

234
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,516
Men like your uncle, who truly
know about military bio-weapons

235
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:32,518
have all either retired or died.

236
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:34,153
They're known as fossils.

237
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:36,922
We sent an agent out
from the Seattle office.

238
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:38,957
Your uncle threatened
to shoot him.

239
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,093
Apparently, he has
privacy issues.

240
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:42,862
Good luck.

241
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,300
Agent Blake?

242
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:49,501
Yes.

243
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:51,236
Donald Wells, CDC.

244
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,571
This way.

245
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:53,939
I'll take those, ma'am.

246
00:12:53,972 --> 00:12:55,107
Thank you.

247
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,574
What's your setup?

248
00:12:56,608 --> 00:12:59,011
Looks like the interior
of the ship is level four.

249
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,513
We have a negative airflow
and hepa filters in place.

250
00:13:01,546 --> 00:13:03,348
We've also
bleached down all surfaces.

251
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:04,382
Noninfected

252
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,018
are confined to cabins.

253
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:08,587
The infected are in public
rooms under plastic tents.

254
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,590
We're using the kitchen's
refrigerators as morgues.

255
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,358
The Coast Guard's
running security.

256
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:16,194
The Army's CBD Com has been
flying in men and supplies.

257
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,563
What's the dead?

258
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,198
33 and climbing.

259
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:22,868
This is our level two.

260
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:24,203
We suit up here.

261
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:39,852
Welcome, Special Agent Blake,
to the<i> American Anthem</i> ballroom.

262
00:13:59,604 --> 00:14:02,875
(<i> patients coughing</i> )

263
00:14:40,345 --> 00:14:42,147
Ship's doctor.

264
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,482
Airborne?

265
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:46,184
Negative. It spreads
like the flu.

266
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:49,187
Sneezing, coughing, touch...

267
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,522
an exchange
of bodily fluids.

268
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:53,157
You know what introduced
it aboard the ship?

269
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:54,226
No, we don't.

270
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:56,395
What's the CDC
lab saying?

271
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,597
Like Marburg,
but not like Marburg.

272
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,699
Could it be
genetically altered?

273
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:03,367
Could be anything.

274
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:05,103
You don't! You're
not in my position!

275
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:06,570
You don't know
how I feel!

276
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:08,307
I don't even know if my
husband's dead or alive!

277
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,574
Why can't you
call the ship?

278
00:15:09,607 --> 00:15:10,976
I already told you.

279
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:12,311
They must have
a passenger list!

280
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:13,946
Yes, yes,
of course they do.

281
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,447
Well, then,
who's in charge?

282
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,282
Well, the thing is,
I'm in charge

283
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:18,517
and I'm in charge

284
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,352
and I don't know
what's going on, either.

285
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:21,386
His name is Irving.

286
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:22,521
Mark Irving.

287
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:24,089
(<i> music playing</i> )

288
00:15:24,122 --> 00:15:25,357
(<i> woman weeping</i> )

289
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,259
Excuse me. Are you Maria Cruz?

290
00:15:27,292 --> 00:15:28,360
Yes.

291
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:29,661
And this would be Oakley?

292
00:15:29,694 --> 00:15:31,295
Mm-hmm.

293
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:32,396
Is my husband all right?

294
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,364
Um, do you know?

295
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:34,499
Is he still on the ship?

296
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:36,101
Yes, he's still
on the ship.

297
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:37,736
They're not letting
anybody off at this moment

298
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,538
but you can talk to him.

299
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:42,541
Would you like that?

300
00:15:42,574 --> 00:15:43,742
Okay. Let's go.

301
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:47,012
MAN:<i>
 A lot of people are sick</i>

302
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:48,747
and some of them have died.

303
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,615
Nobody seems to know why.

304
00:15:50,648 --> 00:15:54,419
All these doctors are walking
around in these bubble suits

305
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:57,456
like everyone's
radioactive mutants.

306
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:03,728
For God's sakes, stop crying.

307
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:05,497
I'm going to be all right.

308
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,199
I'm going to sail
right through this thing.

309
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:09,300
You watch me, girl.

310
00:16:09,334 --> 00:16:10,301
Okay.

311
00:16:10,335 --> 00:16:11,303
How's Oakley?

312
00:16:11,336 --> 00:16:12,537
He's fine. He's here.

313
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,139
You want to talk to him?

314
00:16:14,172 --> 00:16:15,340
Yeah, yeah.

315
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:16,675
Let me get him.

316
00:16:18,676 --> 00:16:20,245
No, listen, wait.

317
00:16:20,278 --> 00:16:23,115
I can't. Uh, the captain just...

318
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,149
Oh, no. He's right here.

319
00:16:24,182 --> 00:16:25,250
Just a second.

320
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:26,518
I'll talk to him later.

321
00:16:26,551 --> 00:16:29,688
Um... I'll be home
sooner than you know.

322
00:16:30,455 --> 00:16:32,290
Oh, okay. I love you.

323
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:34,226
Me, too.

324
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:39,531
He had to go.

325
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:41,266
The captain called.

326
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:47,272
Edward Cruz, head
of our security.

327
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:48,507
Yes. I've been checking

328
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,410
our passenger list
against the CDC's list

329
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:53,545
and I did come up
with one discrepancy--

330
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:55,613
Hakim Sharif.

331
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:57,282
He was traveling alone.

332
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:59,251
He's no longer
aboard the ship.

333
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,119
Had a Lebanese passport.

334
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:02,654
Where would he
have gotten off?

335
00:17:02,687 --> 00:17:04,289
I don't know.

336
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:06,558
The only place could
have been Puerto Vallarta.

337
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,727
I need to see all the
information you have on him

338
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:11,730
and I need to
see his cabin.

339

MAN (<i> over radio</i> )

with the closing of two more
opposition newspapers.

Well, quit playing games.

365
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,795
Tell me about the ship's
air circulation system.

366
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:26,731
I'll have to find
the ship's engineer.

367
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:27,966
I think he's pretty sick.

368
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:29,634
Do you know where
the intakes are?

369
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,235
Some. You want
to come with me?

370
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:36,875
Your father and me in Germany.

371
00:19:36,908 --> 00:19:38,310
How's your mother?

372
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,912
Fine. She remarried
15 years ago

373
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:43,581
to an air conditioning tycoon.

374
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:45,283
Lives in Florida.

375
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:46,685
Uh, sends her love.

376
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:47,953
Liar.

377
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:50,254
She would just as soon

378
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:51,924
see me chopped into fish chum.

379
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,260
You, uh, married?

380
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:56,794
Yes. Six months ago.

381
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,530
To a doctor.

382
00:19:56,828 --> 00:19:58,530
Kids?

383
00:19:58,563 --> 00:19:59,698
Not yet.

384
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:00,899
Hmm. So, uh...

385
00:20:00,932 --> 00:20:02,234
What's this about?

386
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,935
Is this a<i>
 Roots</i> thing?

387
00:20:03,968 --> 00:20:05,503
Do you want to know

388
00:20:05,536 --> 00:20:08,373
that your grandfather
was a mean drunk?

389
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:09,975
Or that your
great-aunt

390
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,744
married a Chinaman
and was disowned?

391
00:20:12,777 --> 00:20:13,878
Or, uh, is this

392
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:15,580
about your father?

393
00:20:15,613 --> 00:20:19,684
I'm here because of your
involvement with bio-weapons

394
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:20,719
in the 50's and 60's.

395
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:21,653
My boss...

396
00:20:21,686 --> 00:20:22,754
Your boss?

397
00:20:22,787 --> 00:20:24,656
I work for the FBI.

398
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:31,296
And my boss wanted
your opinion on this photo.

399
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,898
This about that cruise ship
off Long Beach?

400
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:35,500
Yeah. How'd
you know that?

401
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:38,003
I may be a recluse,
but I still have a TV.

402
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:42,674
Mmm.

403
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,411
Pretty work.

404
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:15,040
You all right, Mr. Cruz?

405
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:18,543
Yeah. I-I... I
just need a moment.

406
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:34,526
You wake up one morning,
like any other morning

407
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:36,494
you go to work...

408
00:21:36,527 --> 00:21:38,496
you breathe a little air

409
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,832
and the next thing you know,
you're a walking corpse.

410
00:21:40,865 --> 00:21:42,734
Well, you don't know that.

411
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:44,536
I've seen
the CDC's report.

412
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,372
Two days from infection
to your first symptoms

413
00:21:47,405 --> 00:21:50,375
and then another day or two
after that to death.

414
00:21:50,408 --> 00:21:53,879
It's the hard math.

415
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:57,916
I should have spent
more time at home.

416
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:00,419
I should have
done right by my family.

417
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:07,993
What is it?

418
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,649
Who is it?

419
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:32,984
Mr. Sharif.

420
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:39,691
WOMAN:
There's a phone call
for you, Dr. Rosenberg.

421
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,396
Hello?

422
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,597
LARRY:
Working hard?

423
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,098
Slow night. How's it with you?

424
00:22:47,131 --> 00:22:49,467
It's okay.
He's upstairs in the attic

425
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,603
looking for some files
or something.

426
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,405
Oh, yeah? What's it like?

427
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,708
It's like finding out
you're related to Dr. Mengele.

428
00:22:56,741 --> 00:22:58,576
Ooh. When you coming home?

429
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:00,011
Oh, I don't know.

430
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:02,514
Hey, did you give
those tickets to Timmy?

431
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,516
No. The party's
not till tomorrow.

432
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,884
Have you unpacked anything?

433
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,084
New plan.

434
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:09,620
I'm thinking of a giant bonfire

435
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,056
following our renunciation
of all worldly possessions

436
00:23:12,089 --> 00:23:13,725
and an oath of poverty.

437
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,560
Oh, very spiritual,
but can we keep the TV?

438
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:16,594
If you're good.

439
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:17,829
I found it!
Come on up!

440
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:18,997
Well, listen, I have to go.

441
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,031
I love you.

442
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,467
I love you too. Bye.

443
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,774
Yuri Zenkovsky.

444
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:31,176
Yuri Zenkovsky. Who's he?

445
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,111
An ex-<i> biopreperate</i>
scientist.

446
00:23:33,144 --> 00:23:34,078
Bio what?

447
00:23:34,111 --> 00:23:35,914
Soviet bio-weapons lab.

448
00:23:35,947 --> 00:23:37,614
He made your powder.

449
00:23:37,648 --> 00:23:38,649
What powder?

450
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,051
The one in the photo.

451
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:42,187
Making a military
bio-weapon's

452
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,056
a lot more than just
producing a virus.

453
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:47,759
It's also how you
deliver the virus.

454
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:51,196
One way is by adhering
it to a resin or powder.

455
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,964
Microencapsulation.

456
00:23:52,997 --> 00:23:56,501
Makes the virus float
in the air like dust motes.

457
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:01,639
Well, that is, until it's sucked
down someone's unlucky windpipe.

458
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:04,709
And Yuri Zenkovsky made that?

459
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:05,743
Definitely.

460
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:06,978
Not the virus

461
00:24:07,011 --> 00:24:09,013
the powder. Yes.

462
00:24:09,046 --> 00:24:10,682
Very elegant.

463
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:13,952
Well, we need to find out
who made the virus.

464
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:15,253
Yuri might know.

465
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:17,188
Well, a lot of good
that does us.

466
00:24:17,221 --> 00:24:18,957
Well, he defected
to the U.S.

467
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,959
after the Soviet
breakup in '92.

468
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,894
We... we could ask him.

469
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:24,629
If we could find him.

470
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:26,898
He, uh, he's been in hiding.

471
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:28,766
Hmm. KGB?

472
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,735
No. Visa.

473
00:24:30,768 --> 00:24:31,870
Visa?

474
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,705
CIA gave him

475
00:24:33,738 --> 00:24:35,840
a credit card when
he first came over.

476
00:24:35,873 --> 00:24:37,775
He was unfamiliar
with the concept.

477
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:40,011
Didn't realize that
after you buy and buy

478
00:24:40,044 --> 00:24:41,579
you have to pay and pay.

479
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:44,916
I, uh.... I haven't
seen him in a few years

480
00:24:44,949 --> 00:24:48,019
but I know I have an
address on him somewhere.

481
00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:53,825
This, uh... this stuff here.

482
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:55,025
What is it?

483
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:57,696
Oh, that's a brain virus.

484
00:25:00,598 --> 00:25:02,200
It's dead.

485
00:25:02,233 --> 00:25:03,835
Don't worry, it's harmless.

486
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:05,770
It's used to
test dispersion.

487
00:25:10,207 --> 00:25:11,743
Come here.

488
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:14,012
Come on. I'll show
you something.

489
00:25:17,982 --> 00:25:18,917
Oh, rain stopped.

490
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,118
That's good.

491
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:23,721
Can't have it raining.

492
00:25:23,754 --> 00:25:26,858
Bio-weapons... are
useless in the rain.

493
00:25:26,891 --> 00:25:31,029
Let's see, winds out
of the northwest,
one to three knots.

494
00:25:31,862 --> 00:25:33,064
Slight inversion layer...

495
00:25:33,097 --> 00:25:36,000
You see that glow over the hill?

496
00:25:36,033 --> 00:25:37,569
Seattle.

497
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:47,612
If that was real,
I just killed, about...

498
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:49,147
oh, one half
of Seattle.

499
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,949
250,000 souls or so.

500
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:55,287
Of course, uh, they won't
know it for a few days.

501
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:13,939

What are you doing?

504
00:26:27,351 --> 00:26:28,620
Nothing.

505
00:26:28,653 --> 00:26:31,356
Oh, look at you.
You're a mess.

506
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:33,825

508
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:36,894
I'm glad you
could make it.

509
00:26:36,927 --> 00:26:38,763
Hi, Peter.

510
00:26:38,796 --> 00:26:42,334
Hey, Hela, why don't
you take my clever
little princess

511
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:44,335
and get her some pizza.

512
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:45,903
How about some
pizza, Abigale?

513
00:26:45,936 --> 00:26:47,004
Oh, that looks great.

514
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,106
Yeah.

515
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:49,674
Hey, Timmy's been
asking for you

516
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:51,109
so I don't want him
getting all jealous.

517
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,244
Oh, you remember
my sister Patty?

518
00:26:53,277 --> 00:26:55,780
Oh, hi. Of course.
Nice to see you.

519
00:26:55,813 --> 00:26:56,814
You, too. How are you?

520
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:57,882
Hey, Timmy.

521
00:26:57,915 --> 00:26:59,183
Timmy, it's Judy.

522
00:26:57,915 --> 00:26:59,183
Judy!

523
00:26:59,216 --> 00:27:00,385
Judy!

524
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,085
It's the birthday boy!

525
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:04,956
Well, I have a very
cool present for you.

526
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:06,257
You want it?

527
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,658
Yeah!

528
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:10,362
It's for game four
of the playoffs.

529
00:27:11,228 --> 00:27:11,996
You can go with
your father.

530
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:14,032
What do you say, champ?

531
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:17,935
I love you!

No. They sent him
to Seattle.

No. Why?

545
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,283
Because it's so deadly.

546
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,987
Well, that's what
weapons are, Larry.

547
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,156
At least the good ones.

548
00:28:12,189 --> 00:28:14,859
This is
just more repulsive.

549
00:28:14,892 --> 00:28:18,329
Than what, a bullet
in the face?

550
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:20,998
The dead don't
complain, you know.

551
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:24,235
Now, I personally find
nuclear weapons repulsive.

552
00:28:24,268 --> 00:28:25,970
They destroy everything.

553
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:28,973
Bio-weapons are, uh,
they're kinder.

554
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:31,843
They only destroy
bioactivity.

555
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:32,844
Bioactivity?

556
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:33,845
People.

557
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,245
Oh, come on.

558
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,914
Don't you find
the idea of using disease

559
00:28:36,947 --> 00:28:39,082
as a weapon somewhat...
ghoulish?

560
00:28:39,116 --> 00:28:42,287
Was God ghoulish
when he sent the plagues
upon Pharaoh's people?

561
00:28:42,953 --> 00:28:43,888
You're not God.

562
00:28:43,921 --> 00:28:45,523
Oh, please.

563
00:28:45,556 --> 00:28:49,327
The Assyrians poisoned
wells with rye fungus.

564
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,463
The Tartars catapulted
plague corpses

565
00:28:52,496 --> 00:28:54,132
over their enemies' walls.

566
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,334
And the English,
they sent blankets

567
00:28:56,367 --> 00:29:00,805
infected with smallpox
to hostile American Indians.

568
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:03,007
I did not invent the idea.

569
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,841
No, you did not.

570
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:06,778
But you perfected it,
and you refined the weapon.

571
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,980
Yep. Yep, I did.

572
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,948
For God and country.

573
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:14,152
Oh.

574
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,888
MAN:<i>
 No match on prints
 or visual match</i>

575
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,023
<i> off the known terrorists list.</i>

576
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:22,127
We have his picture out
to all our embassies.

577
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,463
How did he get his hands
on a Soviet-type bio-weapon?

578
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:26,564
Can we track it?

579
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:27,999
That's difficult.

580
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,300
After the breakup
of the Soviet Union

581
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:30,568
so many of their
scientists

582
00:29:30,601 --> 00:29:32,136
were recruited
by other countries.

583
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:33,805
Put somebody on that.

584
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,840
Start with the obvious
Syria, Libya, Iran, Iraq

585
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:37,575
Osama bin Laden,
North Korea, Pakistan...

586
00:29:37,608 --> 00:29:39,143
I appreciate it.

587
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:40,511
All right, the CDC
says it'll be days

588
00:29:40,544 --> 00:29:42,113
before the exact nature
of the virus is known.

589
00:29:42,146 --> 00:29:43,848
It's a hemorrhagic hybrid.

590
00:29:43,881 --> 00:29:45,383
That's all they know
until they decode the RNA.

591
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:47,351
What do the Russians say?
It's their virus.

592
00:29:47,384 --> 00:29:50,789
The Russians have denied
any and all knowledge of a virus

593
00:29:52,122 --> 00:29:54,025
and if you believe CNN,
they've closed their borders.

594
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:56,260
I heard from
a friend at the CIA

595
00:29:56,293 --> 00:29:58,295
they're picking up extensive
troop movements

596
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,496
in North Korea and Iraq.

597
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,033
Wardley's ready?

598
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:03,034
Yes, sir.

599
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:04,402
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

600
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:07,839
Can you get
Colonel Walker's office?

601
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,974
What's the situation
on the ship?

602
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:12,043
Out of the 1,564,
23 have died.

603
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,511
Another 507
have symptoms

604
00:30:13,544 --> 00:30:16,414
and probably will die
in the next 48 hours.

605
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,515
God.

606
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:20,618
It's a good thing
he decided to hit a ship.

607
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:22,353
At least that way,
it was contained.

608
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:24,923
I think he wanted
to introduce the
biological agent

609
00:30:26,223 --> 00:30:27,291
then have all
the passengers
go to their houses

610
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:28,459
all over the United States

611
00:30:28,492 --> 00:30:30,293
before any major
symptoms occurred.

612
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:32,964
The death rate would
have been a thousand
times greater.

613
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:34,398
Why didn't he?

614
00:30:34,431 --> 00:30:36,500
Well, the ship changed
its last port of call

615
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:38,302
from Mazatlán to
Puerto Vallarta

616
00:30:38,335 --> 00:30:40,972
gaining a full day at sea,
so we really got lucky.

617
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,940
Did Sharif call
anybody from the ship?

618
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:45,509
Uh, he made three calls
to a cell phone outside D.C.

619
00:30:45,542 --> 00:30:47,011
Can we trace it?

620
00:30:47,044 --> 00:30:48,980
We can triangulate
if the phone's on

621
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,414
but so far it's been off.

622
00:30:50,447 --> 00:30:52,116
All right.

623
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:54,485
In the ninth inning,
it is Houston three...

624
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:55,887
Mr. Wardley?

625
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,221
...and Chicago two.

626
00:30:57,254 --> 00:31:01,458
Oh, sorry.
Uh, I have it
here somewhere.

627
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:03,561
That Arabic document
you found on the ship

628
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:07,098
it's a fatwa,
a religious decree.

629
00:31:07,531 --> 00:31:08,566
Decreeing what?

630
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,167
Uh, standard stuff.

631
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,069
A terror campaign
against the United States

632
00:31:12,102 --> 00:31:13,905
for the desecration
of holy lands

633
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:15,106
in Saudi Arabia.

634
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:16,607
Do you know
who wrote it?

635
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,176
Yeah. Al Qaeda, fringe
organization in Afghanistan.

636
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:20,278
You're sure?

637
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,646
Quite sure.

638
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,382
They were, uh,
good enough to sign it.

639
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:28,286
Here and, uh, here.

640
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:30,354
It looks like
it was imprinted
in Pakistan

641
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:32,490
although it could
have been done in Kabul.

642
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,125
I've seen a few
like this before.

643
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:35,626
It's consistent
in text and style

644
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:37,261
with the one
Al Qaeda released

645
00:31:37,294 --> 00:31:39,530
just before the bombings
in Kenya and Tanzania.

646
00:31:39,563 --> 00:31:41,432
ANNOUNCER:
And here's the pitch...

647
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,200
and that's a ball

648
00:31:44,234 --> 00:31:46,404
just off the outside corner.

649
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,104
Here in the bottom
of the ninth inning

650
00:31:48,138 --> 00:31:49,307
Houston leading three to two.

651
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,576
Chicago's got a runner
on second.

652
00:31:54,745 --> 00:31:56,147
Guerrero digs in.

653
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,182
The count is two and two.

654
00:31:58,215 --> 00:32:01,285
Two outs.

655
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:03,387
And he's waiting
for John Miller's pitch.

656
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:06,357
I think Guerrero is going
to wait for Miller

657
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:07,926
to throw that change-up.

658
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,967
Francisco's taking
a healthy lead at second base.

659
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:20,404
Oh, and that was almost
a passed ball

660
00:32:20,437 --> 00:32:21,438
a very wild pitch

661
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,706
from John Miller

662
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,308
making the count three and two.

663
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:25,676
And Tim Lee has called time out.

664
00:32:25,709 --> 00:32:28,145
He's going to travel
to the mound

665
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:30,614
to talk to Miller,
try to settle him down.

666
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:34,953
He's joined there by
John O'Brien from third base.

667
00:32:35,452 --> 00:32:36,687
This sellout crowd

668
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,689
of 63,000 does not want

669
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:42,326
to give Miller any more time.

670
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:44,628
Miller hasn't worked
since game one

671
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:48,299
and in that game Guerrero
took him deep to left.

672
00:33:02,112 --> 00:33:04,649
(<i> organ playing &quot;Charge&quot;</i> )

673
00:34:00,704 --> 00:34:03,206
UMPIRE:
Foul.

674
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:58,189
WOMAN (<i> over television</i> ):
&quot;...that our actions today
speak louder than words.

675
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,324
There will be no sanctuary
for terrorism.&quot;

676
00:36:00,357 --> 00:36:02,293
Hello?

677
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:05,796
...about 60 cruise missiles
were launched from ships

678
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:09,300
in the Arabian Sea
under the cover of darkness.

679
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,735
The target was identified
by Pentagon officials

680
00:36:11,768 --> 00:36:14,838
as an extensive terrorist
training complex in Afghanistan

681
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:17,708
94 miles south of Kabul.

682
00:36:17,741 --> 00:36:20,277
The President and his
national security team

683
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,913
link the site
to Osama bin Laden

684
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,382
the exiled Saudi millionaire.

685
00:36:25,415 --> 00:36:28,319
MAN:
Hey!

686
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,920
Terrorist experts say Bin Laden

687
00:36:29,953 --> 00:36:31,388
is responsible for...

688
00:36:31,421 --> 00:36:32,756
Can I help
you guys?

689
00:36:32,789 --> 00:36:34,592
Yeah. FBI.

690
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,694
Here to see
Yuri Zenkovsky.

691
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,545
Yuri, you old goat.

692
00:36:54,578 --> 00:36:57,281
Mr. Johnny Sullivan!

693
00:36:57,314 --> 00:36:58,515
(<i> laughing</i> )

694
00:36:58,548 --> 00:37:01,919
Such a surprise!

695
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:03,988
Yuri, this is
my nephew Larry.

696
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,956
Larry's with the FBI.

697
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:08,359
A pleasure.

698
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:08,359
Likewise.

699
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,028
So, look at you--
making aspirin.

700
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:13,664
You've turned into
a healer, you know.

701
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:17,668
Yes, finally I've become
a low-paid humanitarian.

702
00:37:17,701 --> 00:37:19,937
No wonder Sonia
kicked you out.

703
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,038
Mm-hmm.

704
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:22,606
Oh, uh, Larry
has a photo

705
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:23,841
he wants to show you.

706
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:26,042
It was taken
aboard the ship

707
00:37:26,076 --> 00:37:28,512
with all those
sick people.
Mm-hmm.

708
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:36,787
Yes, yes.

709
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,324
Yes, the encapsulation
is definitely mine.

710
00:37:40,724 --> 00:37:42,793
Beautiful, no?

711
00:37:42,826 --> 00:37:46,397
The virus was made
at Buchaparat

712
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:51,301
near Kosovo in 1984
by Serge Kurbsky.

713
00:37:51,935 --> 00:37:55,606
This... is very, very bad.

714
00:37:56,006 --> 00:37:57,607
What is it?

715
00:37:57,641 --> 00:38:01,312
It is a Marburg
influenza hybrid.

716
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:05,283
Oh, my God, that's,
uh, that's insane.
Mmm.

717
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:07,884
You... you'd just end up
killing everyone

718
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:09,386
yourselves included.

719
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:12,856
We...<i> they</i> didn't
think so.

720
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:15,559
They consider the
USA a deep target.

721
00:38:15,592 --> 00:38:17,961
The virus has a
very short cycle.

722
00:38:17,994 --> 00:38:19,396
They thought...

723
00:38:19,429 --> 00:38:21,432
it will burn
itself out here

724
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,500
and with the
borders closed

725
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:26,904
it will never make it
back to the motherland.

726
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,707
JOHN:
It was made

727
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,875
as a tactical weapon
to create a viral firestorm

728
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:35,512
that would burn itself
out in North America.

729
00:38:35,545 --> 00:38:37,114
Burn itself out?

730
00:38:37,147 --> 00:38:40,384
The virus. It would die
when it ran out of hosts.

731
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,387
Oh. Well, why would it
run out of hosts?

732
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,122
Because...

733
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:49,126
it kills them all.

734
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,794
Because this guy Serge Kurbsky
invented it

735
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:52,963
doesn't mean he has anything
to do with it now.

736
00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:55,666
Bin Laden probably stole
or bought the virus

737
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:57,568
from the old Soviet stockpiles.

738
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:59,103
Well, I don't know.

739
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:01,638
Now, Yuri said that Serge
married an Iraqi woman

740
00:39:01,671 --> 00:39:05,008
in the early 80s, and then when
the Soviet Union broke apart

741
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:07,845
they moved to Iraq,
where later his wife was killed

742
00:39:07,878 --> 00:39:09,947
in a U.S. bombing raid
over Baghdad.

743
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,715
Now, how's that for motive?

744
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:14,051
Larry.

745
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:14,051
Huh?

746
00:39:14,084 --> 00:39:16,486
This is Serge.

747
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,855
Oh, oh. Thank you.

748
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,990
Larry? Larry?

749
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:21,392
I'm sorry. What?

750
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,527
I still don't see the connection

751
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,397
between Kurbsky and Bin Laden
in Afghanistan.

752
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,798
Well, maybe there isn't one.

753
00:39:27,831 --> 00:39:30,167
Maybe the whole
fatwa/Afghanistan connection

754
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,902
was a deliberate misdirect.

755
00:39:31,935 --> 00:39:35,572
Maybe we bombed the wrong
country. I don't know.

756
00:39:35,605 --> 00:39:37,741
Hold on.

757
00:39:37,774 --> 00:39:39,877
Do you have
yesterday's paper?

758
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,145
Of course.

759
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,515

No.

Now... a tactical weapon

850
00:45:34,931 --> 00:45:36,199

and indirectly in Houston

855
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:45,408
but if this is a planned,
coordinated attack

856

why haven't they hit us

There are a lot of rumors

Kurbsky may be working for

00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:34,350
the early closing of
the Russian borders;

902
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,386
the stonewalling
of any information

903
00:47:36,419 --> 00:47:38,020
connected with the virus;

904
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:41,191
and finally, the Russian
military on high alert

905
00:47:41,224 --> 00:47:43,994
possibly providing
protection for
Iraqi troops

906
00:47:45,094 --> 00:47:46,396
moving toward Kuwait
and Saudi Arabia.

907
00:47:46,429 --> 00:47:48,131
For what... for what purpose?

908
00:47:48,164 --> 00:47:50,066
First step for a
new Russian empire.

909
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:51,968
That's insane.

910
00:47:52,001 --> 00:47:53,203
Absolutely.

911
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:57,007
But the question
is-- is it true?

912
00:48:01,444 --> 00:48:04,348
(<i> men talking indistinctly</i> )

913
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:12,322
MAN:
Yeah? Who is it?

914
00:48:12,355 --> 00:48:13,490
FBI.

915
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:18,295
Have you seen this man?

916
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:20,397
No. Never seen him.

917
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:21,531
No?

918
00:48:21,564 --> 00:48:22,598
What'd he do?

919
00:48:22,632 --> 00:48:23,667
Nothing. Yet.

920
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,935
Sorry to bother you.

921
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:30,674
<i> Larry...</i>

922
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:32,609
LARRY (<i> over phone</i> ):<i>
 Ah, fine.</i>

923
00:48:32,642 --> 00:48:34,611
<i>Listen, I've been going crazy.
 Are you all right?</i>

924
00:48:34,644 --> 00:48:36,379
It's chaos;
hundreds are coming in.

925
00:48:36,412 --> 00:48:38,580
We're totally overwhelmed.
It's-it's horrible.

926
00:48:38,614 --> 00:48:41,051
Judy, listen to me.
I want you out of Chicago.

927
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,618
Now, I've arranged
transportation...

928
00:48:42,652 --> 00:48:44,120
Don't be silly.
I can't leave.

929
00:48:44,153 --> 00:48:45,321
Well, you can't stay.

930
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:46,523
The fatality rate is near 100%.

931
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,491
Once you get it.

932
00:48:48,524 --> 00:48:50,125
Everyone who's been exposed
to the powder has gotten it

933
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:51,728
so you got to get out of there
right now.

934
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:53,196
Well, the powder's long gone.

935
00:48:53,229 --> 00:48:54,397
It's spreading its disease now.

936
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:56,132
There are precautions.

937
00:48:56,165 --> 00:48:57,433
Judy, I've arranged
to get you out of there, okay?

938
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:59,002
Larry, listen to me.
I'm staying.

939
00:48:59,035 --> 00:49:02,439
It's my job.

940
00:49:06,509 --> 00:49:10,981
Jude, listen,
I understand what you're saying.

941
00:49:11,014 --> 00:49:13,350
I understand it's your job.

942
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:15,018
But I cannot bear

943
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:17,520
the idea of something
happening to you.

944
00:49:17,553 --> 00:49:19,089
I'm fine. Don't worry.

945
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,024
You taking all the precautions?

946
00:49:21,057 --> 00:49:23,292
You doing everything
you need to do?

947
00:49:23,326 --> 00:49:25,395
Yes. We know what we're doing.

948
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,969
How is Peter and Timmy?

949
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:35,439
Not good.

950
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:38,541
And Abigale?

951
00:49:38,574 --> 00:49:44,414
I think the nanny took her over
to Peter's sister's house.

952
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:47,149
Have you, uh... have you
unpacked everything

953
00:49:47,183 --> 00:49:48,518
at the house?

954
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:51,254
No. I can't seem
to find the time.

955
00:49:51,287 --> 00:49:52,422
Judy, come on.

956
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:54,624
Let's go.

957
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:54,624
I got to go.

958
00:49:54,657 --> 00:49:56,693
All right.

959
00:49:56,726 --> 00:49:58,361
I love you.

960
00:49:58,394 --> 00:50:00,564
I love you, too.

961
00:50:12,775 --> 00:50:14,444
You all right?

962
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:17,113
Yeah. I'm
just worried.

963
00:50:17,146 --> 00:50:20,684
Judy's in Chicago
at ground zero.

964
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,787
Well, if I have any extra time,
I'll check up on her.

965
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,188
You going to Chicago?

966
00:50:25,221 --> 00:50:26,790
The Chicago police
have a suspect.

967
00:50:26,823 --> 00:50:28,424
I'm heading out
to question him.

968
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:29,592
Good luck.

969
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:31,261
Yeah.

970
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:40,403
Hey, thanks.

971
00:50:40,436 --> 00:50:41,838
LARRY:<i>
 What sort of man</i>

972
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:45,442
would knowingly kill thousands?

973
00:50:45,475 --> 00:50:49,212
In my experience,
exceptionally normal ones.

974
00:50:49,745 --> 00:50:51,080
Hey, you don't think

975
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:53,116
that if you looked
into his eyes--

976
00:50:53,149 --> 00:50:54,717
I mean, you really looked--

977
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:57,754
don't you think you'd see
the eyes of a madman?

978
00:50:57,787 --> 00:50:59,489
(<i> chuckles</i> )

979
00:50:59,522 --> 00:51:01,124
I doubt it.

980
00:51:01,157 --> 00:51:06,162
You don't think
much of humanity, do you?

981
00:51:06,195 --> 00:51:08,098
Not really, no.

982
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,333
Neither does your virus.

983
00:51:10,366 --> 00:51:12,134
Oh, it's hardly mine.

984
00:51:12,168 --> 00:51:14,838
Marburg has a good mind
of its own.

985
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:17,273
Where's it from?

986
00:51:17,306 --> 00:51:19,442
The Kiddam Cave
in Northern Kenya.

987
00:51:19,475 --> 00:51:21,411
Why do they
call it Marburg?

988
00:51:21,444 --> 00:51:22,745
Marburg's in Germany.

989
00:51:22,778 --> 00:51:24,781
Why don't they
call it Kiddam?

990
00:51:24,814 --> 00:51:28,350
It's always named after the town
that had the first outbreak.

991
00:51:28,384 --> 00:51:29,853
Marburg?

992
00:51:29,886 --> 00:51:32,422
An infected lab monkey
was shipped from Kenya

993
00:51:32,455 --> 00:51:36,326
to a research complex
at Marburg.

994
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:40,297
People got sick.

995
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:42,732
What year
was that?

996
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:44,600
1968.

997
00:51:51,707 --> 00:51:53,442
That was the year
my father died.

998
00:51:53,476 --> 00:51:55,245
That's correct.

999
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,381
So he wasn't working for
the judge advocate general?

1000
00:51:58,414 --> 00:52:02,619
No. Army intelligence.

1001
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:03,920
Yeah, see, I...

1002
00:52:03,953 --> 00:52:07,190
you know,
I'd heard that around

1003
00:52:07,223 --> 00:52:10,127
and it sounded true.

1004
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:15,698
Your father
was sent to Marburg

1005
00:52:15,731 --> 00:52:19,202
to collect a sample
of the virus for our lab.

1006
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:23,506
Did he succeed?

1007
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:24,674
Oh, uh...

1008
00:52:24,707 --> 00:52:26,576
in a way.

1009
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:30,379
He got sick.

1010
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,515
That's what killed him.

1011
00:52:32,548 --> 00:52:35,185
The heart attack story
was just a cover.

1012
00:52:48,397 --> 00:52:50,200
That why my mother hates you?

1013
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,769
In part.

1014
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:54,804
What's the other part?

1015
00:52:57,273 --> 00:53:00,310
I took a piece of his liver
back to Virginia

1016
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,743
to cultivate the virus.

1017
00:53:01,777 --> 00:53:04,847
Your, uh...

1018
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,186
mother considered that
in poor taste.

1019
00:53:34,310 --> 00:53:36,879
I haven't always done
what's right.

1020
00:53:36,912 --> 00:53:38,680
I know that.

1021
00:53:38,714 --> 00:53:42,884
But, uh...

1022
00:53:42,918 --> 00:53:45,855
I loved my brother very much.

1023
00:53:45,888 --> 00:53:50,660
Your mother
never forgave me.

1024
00:53:50,693 --> 00:53:53,530
And I should?

1025
00:54:02,972 --> 00:54:05,008
MAN:<i>
 We just got lucky is all.</i>

1026
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:08,745
He tried to leave the stadium
through an illegal exit.

1027
00:54:08,778 --> 00:54:10,279
Mmm.

1028
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:11,748
Guard told him he
couldn't go that way

1029
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:13,049
he started
swinging at him.

1030
00:54:13,082 --> 00:54:15,718
So they tussled,
and he was arrested.

1031
00:54:15,751 --> 00:54:17,587
He would have
been released

1032
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:20,690
but he wouldn't speak,
so we couldn't I.D. him.

1033
00:54:21,357 --> 00:54:22,025
Didn't say boo.

1034
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:23,993
Some of the boys
down here

1035
00:54:24,026 --> 00:54:25,995
can be pretty
persuasive.

1036
00:54:26,028 --> 00:54:27,830
Look, um, you
should know

1037
00:54:27,863 --> 00:54:30,667
that he's showing signs
of the disease.

1038
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,035
I have a suit.

1039
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:34,337
Even with a monkey suit

1040
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,973
you're a braver man
than me.

1041
00:54:44,046 --> 00:54:45,915
(<i> door closes</i> )

1042
00:54:49,418 --> 00:54:51,054
We know who you are,
Mr. Hamdoon.

1043
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:53,956
We know that you were
a professor in Baghdad

1044
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:55,625
that you speak English

1045
00:54:55,658 --> 00:54:58,028
that your sister and your family
were killed

1046
00:54:58,894 --> 00:54:59,794
in the bombing of your city.

1047
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,832
We know about Dr. Kurbsky
and the bio-weapon

1048
00:55:02,865 --> 00:55:05,435
and your colleague
and the cruise ship.

1049
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,571
You want to see a picture
of your colleague?

1050
00:55:10,606 --> 00:55:12,375
Oh no.
Don't turn your head.

1051
00:55:12,408 --> 00:55:13,910
There's more.

1052
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,712
There is more.

1053
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:16,846

There's-there's hundreds.
There's thousands.

1064
00:55:47,877 --> 00:55:51,348
And now you're dead.

1065

where Dr. Kurbsky is.

Dr. Kurbsky is.

00:57:39,655 --> 00:57:42,225
JUDY:
Timmy, sweetheart.

1080
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:44,461
He's dead. I just checked him.

1081
00:57:46,962 --> 00:57:48,564
Did you know him?

1082
00:57:48,597 --> 00:57:51,667
Um, yes.

1083
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:52,801
That's his father.

1084
00:57:52,835 --> 00:57:54,170
He works with my husband.

1085
00:57:54,203 --> 00:57:57,273
I'd be surprised if he
regained consciousness.

1086
00:57:57,306 --> 00:57:59,141
Probably better
that way.

1087
00:57:59,174 --> 00:58:01,277
Does he have
any more family here?

1088
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:03,913
No. His wife passed away
two years ago.

1089
00:58:03,946 --> 00:58:05,882
He has a little girl, Abigale.

1090
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,817
She's at his sister's house.

1091
00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:09,218
I'll put in
the order.

1092
00:58:09,251 --> 00:58:11,120
I'll do it.
I want you to go over

1093
00:58:11,153 --> 00:58:12,555
to the Federal Building.

1094
00:58:12,588 --> 00:58:14,223
The Army and the CDC
have converted

1095
00:58:14,256 --> 00:58:16,792
the underground parking into
a massive field hospital.

1096
00:58:16,825 --> 00:58:18,294
Well, what do you
want me to do?

1097
00:58:18,327 --> 00:58:20,630
Beg for supplies.

1098
00:58:27,236 --> 00:58:29,672
MAN (<i> over TV</i> ):
In a bold attempt
to isolate the virus

1099
00:58:29,705 --> 00:58:31,240
and to prevent it from spreading

1100
00:58:31,273 --> 00:58:34,210
the president has ordered the
citizens of the United States

1101
00:58:34,243 --> 00:58:35,678
to remain in their homes.

1102
00:58:35,711 --> 00:58:37,212
Rioting has been reported

1103
00:58:37,246 --> 00:58:40,850
in Chicago, Phoenix,
Los Angeles and San Diego.

1104
00:58:40,883 --> 00:58:42,551
On the international front

1105
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:44,320
Iraq has continued to move
its army

1106
00:58:44,353 --> 00:58:46,689
towards the Saudi Arabian
border, and the United States

1107
00:58:46,722 --> 00:58:49,058
is sending arms and supplies

1108
00:58:49,892 --> 00:58:50,692
to reinforce that border.

1109
00:58:50,726 --> 00:58:52,328
What do you think the
president'll do

1110
00:58:52,361 --> 00:58:54,096
if Iraq goes
into Saudi Arabia?

1111
00:58:54,129 --> 00:58:55,998
I don't know. It's pretty
hard to send ground troops

1112
00:58:56,031 --> 00:58:58,200
to the Persian Gulf
when they're all busy
in the streets

1113
00:58:58,233 --> 00:58:59,635
trying to enforce
this curfew.

1114
00:58:59,668 --> 00:59:02,805
Probably bomb 'em
back to Babylonia.

1115
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:04,206
And the Russians?

1116
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:05,808
The Russians are going
to back down.

1117
00:59:05,841 --> 00:59:07,343
They have to.

1118
00:59:07,376 --> 00:59:09,912
Let's hope they
don't apply the
same logic to us.

1119
00:59:09,945 --> 00:59:11,314
That's World
War III.

1120
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:13,950
Okay, it's coming up
on the main board.

1121
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,218
Courtesy of the CDC.

1122
00:59:16,251 --> 00:59:18,120
Now, this projection

1123
00:59:18,153 --> 00:59:20,756
doesn't include<i> American Anthem,</i>
which was contained

1124
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:22,792
or the possibility
of another nut

1125
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:24,694
out there with another weapon.

1126
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,028
Okay, here's four days ago.

1127
00:59:26,061 --> 00:59:27,196
The Chicago release.

1128
00:59:29,298 --> 00:59:34,102
52 hours after that, these are
the cities that were infected.

1129
00:59:37,139 --> 00:59:40,310
As of the present, here are the
cities that have been infected.

1130
00:59:43,245 --> 00:59:46,214
And here's our best prediction
for seven days from now.

1131
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:55,825
FARRELL:
So what are
they saying

1132
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:59,829
that we're all going to die?

1133
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:03,032
No. Only about 25%.

1134
01:00:03,065 --> 01:00:06,268
The good news is, if we don't
sustain another bio-hit

1135
01:00:06,301 --> 01:00:09,805
our political, military,
and economic infrastructure

1136
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:11,273
will survive and recover.

1137
01:00:11,306 --> 01:00:14,010
And if we do sustain
another bio-hit?

1138
01:00:15,310 --> 01:00:16,980
I don't know.

1139
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:24,987
Do you know where
Dr. Rosenberg is?

1140
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,956
No, I'm sorry.

1141
01:00:29,224 --> 01:00:31,094
I'll be right back.

1142
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:33,828
Hey.

1143
01:00:33,862 --> 01:00:36,366
Larry said you
might come by.

1144
01:00:36,965 --> 01:00:38,801
How are you?

1145
01:00:38,834 --> 01:00:40,970
Well, you know.

1146
01:00:41,003 --> 01:00:42,138
What's it like out there?

1147
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:44,839
Oh... it is like Ecuador
after a bloody coup.

1148
01:00:44,873 --> 01:00:46,776
I mean,
the streets are empty.

1149
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,444
Army everywhere.

1150
01:00:48,477 --> 01:00:51,212
People rioting, trying to get
the hell out of the city.

1151
01:00:51,246 --> 01:00:52,815
Most people are holed up.

1152
01:00:52,848 --> 01:00:54,316
Many dead?

1153
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:56,719
Well, there's a full-time
fire at the landfill.

1154
01:00:56,752 --> 01:00:58,387
And you?
How are you doing?

1155
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:03,059
Uh, I heard that you
have a test to check
for the virus.

1156
01:01:04,426 --> 01:01:06,162
Yes, we've been using it to
screen medical personnel.

1157
01:01:06,195 --> 01:01:07,329
Can you test me?

1158
01:01:07,362 --> 01:01:10,733
Is there any
particular reason?

1159
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:18,240
I have a confession
to make.

1160
01:01:18,273 --> 01:01:19,475
Mm-hmm.

1161
01:01:19,508 --> 01:01:22,178
I never got you guys
a wedding present.

1162
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:23,245
You have a year.

1163
01:01:23,278 --> 01:01:24,245
From the wedding?

1164
01:01:24,279 --> 01:01:25,381
Mm-hmm.

1165
01:01:25,414 --> 01:01:27,083
Oh, great.
The shops are closed.

1166
01:01:27,116 --> 01:01:28,984
I thought I'd have to go out
and loot something.

1167
01:01:29,017 --> 01:01:30,152
You'd loot for us?

1168
01:01:30,185 --> 01:01:32,822
That's so sweet.

1169
01:01:35,924 --> 01:01:38,227
Omega 27?

1170
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:39,762
Larry Sullivan, please.

1171
01:01:41,196 --> 01:01:42,464
M.J. here.

1172
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:45,868
Yeah, I'm at
the hospital.

1173
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:48,738
She's sitting right
in front of me.

1174
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:50,740
Looks good.

1175
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:53,142
She always looks good.

1176
01:01:53,175 --> 01:01:57,080
Yeah, you should know that
Abdus Hamdoon died in prison

1177
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:00,182
before we got any
information out of him.

1178
01:02:00,215 --> 01:02:02,284
Uh, I'm going to be
here for...?

1179
01:02:02,317 --> 01:02:03,953
Two hours.

1180
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:05,254
At least
another two hours.

1181
01:02:05,287 --> 01:02:07,323
Yeah, okay.

1182
01:02:07,356 --> 01:02:08,758
Hold on.

1183
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,826
You want me to go
for a walk?

1184
01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:12,795
No, no. You wait here.
I can get it outside.

1185
01:02:14,029 --> 01:02:15,097
Hey, honey.

1186
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:16,899
LARRY:
Hey.

1187
01:02:16,932 --> 01:02:18,433
You all right?

1188
01:02:18,467 --> 01:02:21,270
I wish you would stop
asking me that. I feel fine.

1189
01:02:22,571 --> 01:02:24,038
I'm sorry. It's just hanging out
with my uncle all week

1190
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:26,175
I've come to realize how
important family is.

1191
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:28,144
Especially the ones
who aren't blood-related.

1192
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:30,312
Everybody feels that way
about their family.

1193
01:02:30,345 --> 01:02:32,448
No. Not everyone has my family.

1194
01:02:34,349 --> 01:02:35,785
Lar?

1195
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:38,187
Yeah?

1196
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:41,890
Do you know how much I love you?

1197
01:02:42,524 --> 01:02:43,926
How happy you've made me?

1198
01:02:43,959 --> 01:02:46,562
How much it means for me
to be your wife?

1199
01:02:46,595 --> 01:02:50,031
Honey...

1200
01:02:50,065 --> 01:02:52,869
i... is something the matter?

1201
01:02:54,536 --> 01:02:58,040
Besides the whole damn world?

1202
01:02:58,073 --> 01:02:59,141
Judy...

1203
01:02:59,174 --> 01:03:00,409
Larry?

1204
01:03:00,442 --> 01:03:02,845
(<i> static</i> )

1205
01:03:00,442 --> 01:03:02,845
Judy? Judy?

1206
01:03:02,878 --> 01:03:05,014
Larry?

1207
01:03:06,915 --> 01:03:09,051
Judy! Judy!

1208
01:03:10,285 --> 01:03:13,356
It's the entire Chicago system.

1209
01:03:18,994 --> 01:03:20,162
He said &quot;Think about it.

1210
01:03:20,195 --> 01:03:21,564
How does it know?&quot;

1211
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:23,432
Okay. It's going to be dark
in three hours.

1212
01:03:23,465 --> 01:03:25,501
The rain is letting up.
I need your help.

1213
01:03:25,534 --> 01:03:26,869
Shoot.

1214
01:03:26,902 --> 01:03:28,070
If you were Serge Kurbsky

1215
01:03:28,103 --> 01:03:30,406
what would be your target
in the city?

1216
01:03:30,439 --> 01:03:34,176
Well, he has a fat ego.

1217
01:03:34,209 --> 01:03:35,578
I say the president.

1218
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,479
Okay. The White House.
Let's assume that.

1219
01:03:37,512 --> 01:03:39,582
Now, where would he have to be
to release the powder?

1220
01:03:39,615 --> 01:03:41,482
Well, he'd have to be high
above the city.

1221
01:03:41,516 --> 01:03:43,586
Then you'd have to know
how the powder drifts.

1222
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:44,987
Rate, spread, dispersion.

1223
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:46,088
You know that, don't you?

1224
01:03:46,121 --> 01:03:47,990
Please, I wrote the book.

1225
01:03:48,023 --> 01:03:49,592
You'd also have to know
the weather conditions.

1226
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:52,027
Well, this was planned months
in advance

1227
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:54,997
so how would you predict
the weather that far ahead?

1228
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:57,900
You'd have to look back
a few years to conditions

1229
01:03:57,933 --> 01:03:59,602
in the month you wanted
to release.

1230
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:02,471
Winds, inversions, temperature--
take an average.

MAN (<i> over TV</i> ):
22 are now confirmed dead

1234
01:04:48,984 --> 01:04:51,220
at the Arlington
Memorial Bridge.

1235
01:04:51,253 --> 01:04:53,222
Over 200 people,
ignoring the curfew

1236
01:04:53,255 --> 01:04:54,590
had gathered at the bridge

1237
01:04:54,623 --> 01:04:56,425
in an attempt to cross
into Virginia.

1238
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:58,994
After failing to disperse
the crowd with tear gas

1239
01:04:59,027 --> 01:05:01,397
the National Guard fired
live rounds into the crowd.

1240
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,132
Has to be more east.

1241
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:04,967
What, you don't
believe me, no?

1242
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,435
No. You're using
the best case.

1243
01:05:06,468 --> 01:05:07,937
We tested it
20 years ago.

1244
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,504
It was just
not that impressive.

1245
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:10,606
Oh, well, yes.

1246
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:12,141
Back in the Black Ages.

1247
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:13,175
But some of us

1248
01:05:13,208 --> 01:05:15,678
continued to work, no?

1249
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:17,346
Continued to perfect.

1250
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,048

I still say east.

No!

Have you?

1464
01:18:42,083 --> 01:18:43,084
I think so. I...

Where?

1466
01:18:44,452 --> 01:18:47,455

Wait. What are you saying?

1494
01:23:35,476 --> 01:23:37,077
Where the hell
are the backup generators?

1495
01:23:37,111 --> 01:23:39,547
Doesn't anything work
in this damn place?

1496
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:42,817
Maybe we should hold a seance;
find out what happens next.

Iraq just crossed the border
into Saudi Arabia.

The Saudis are rolling over.

Have we responded?

I-I don't know.

1502

What about the Russians?

I don't know.

1504

I'm still trying
to call Chicago.

1505

So when are the
lines going to
be operational?

Well, who the
hell would know?

1507
01:24:05,172 --> 01:24:06,840
It might take a while.

1508
01:24:06,874 --> 01:24:09,110
There's nobody left
to maintain the lines
or man the boards.

1509
01:24:09,143 --> 01:24:10,545
Do you have any
communications?

1510
01:24:10,578 --> 01:24:12,080
Short wave.

1511
01:24:12,113 --> 01:24:13,347
Okay. I want to get
hooked up with my wife.

1512

She's at Metropolitan Hospital.

1513

I want to get hooked up
with her right now.

1514

Metropolitan Hospital
is shut down.

1515

She won't be there.

1516

Uh, a message to M.J.

1517
01:24:20,821 --> 01:24:23,358
If I can get
a message to M.J....

1518

No. She's dead.

I'm sorry.

Is there a flight? Anything?
A military flight?

The whole place is shut down

Back to the hotel?

1523

No. Home. Chicago.

Did you hear, uh,
Iraq invaded Saudi Arabia?

1525
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:05,266
Mm'mm.

1526
01:25:05,299 --> 01:25:07,201
So what will you do?

1527
01:25:07,234 --> 01:25:09,737
Oh, I thought
I'd stick around DC

1528
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:11,439
help out if I can.

1529
01:25:11,472 --> 01:25:12,907
I know you can.
