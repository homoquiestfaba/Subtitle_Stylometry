00:00:02,869 --> 00:00:06,236

00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:10,298
(rousing orchestral fanfare playing)

3
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,040
(fanfare ends)

4
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,965
(horn honking)

5
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:38,598
(engine revving)

00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,332
(horns honking)

00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:47,504
(horn honking)

00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,813
(tires squealing)

10
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,714
(bicycle bell tinkles)

11
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,654

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,193

13
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:04,126
(second horn honks)

14
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,663
(tires screech)

15
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:07,824
(engine revving)

16
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:14,633
(tires screeching)

17
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:18,141
(shouting in Hindi)

18
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,774
(indistinct chatter in Hindi,
woman speaking over P.A.)

19
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:29,854
That's my train.

20
00:01:48,074 --> 00:01:51,510
Wait! Wait...!

21
00:01:54,681 --> 00:02:00,347
(The Kinks'
"This Time Tomorrow" playing)

22
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,816
¢Ü This time tomorrow ¢Ü

23
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:10,692
¢Ü Where will we be? ¢Ü

24
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,358
¢Ü On a spaceship somewhere ¢Ü

25
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:21,339
¢Ü Sailing across an empty sea ¢Ü

26
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:25,138
¢Ü This time tomorrow ¢Ü

27
00:02:25,244 --> 00:02:27,712
¢Ü What will we know? ¢Ü

28
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:32,148
¢Ü Will we still be here ¢Ü

29
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:37,848
¢Ü Watching an in-flight
movie show? ¢Ü

30
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:41,723
¢Ü I'll leave the sun behind me ¢Ü

31
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:48,358
¢Ü And I'll watch the clouds
as they sadly pass me by ¢Ü

32
00:02:48,468 --> 00:02:51,232
¢Ü Seven miles below me ¢Ü

33
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:57,765
¢Ü I can see the world
and it ain't so big at all ¢Ü

34
00:02:57,877 --> 00:02:59,777
¢Ü Oh... ¢Ü

35
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,107
(train bells dinging)

36
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,910
¢Ü This time tomorrow ¢Ü

37
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:07,452
¢Ü What will we see? ¢Ü

38
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:10,386
¢Ü Fields full of houses ¢Ü

39
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:17,328
¢Ü Endless rows
of crowded streets. ¢Ü

40
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:37,583
(sighs)

41
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:39,651
(quietly): Shit.

42
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,344
Ow.

43
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,115
(inhales deeply)

44
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:53,029
(snores quietly)

45
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:57,068
Wake up, Jack.

46
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,871
(chuckles)

47
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:17,122
Have you seen Francis?

48
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:19,248
(glasses clinking)

49
00:04:20,993 --> 00:04:23,257
Hello, Peter.

50
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,004
- (Peter chuckles)
- (knocking at door)

51
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:39,202
Good afternoon. Whitman?

52
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:40,745
- Yes.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:42,838
May I see your tickets, please?

54
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,155
Thanks.

55
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,987
There's no smoking, please.

56
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,766
(train car chugging)

57
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,907
Welcome aboard.

58
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:10,976
(speaking in Hindi)

59
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,111
Sweet lime?

60
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,703
- Yes, please.
- Sure, I'll have one.
- Sounds good.

61
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:19,980
(inhales softly)

62
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,958
Let's go get a drink
and smoke a cigarette.

63
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:40,372
I want to start by thanking you both
for being here. Thank you.

64
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,667
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

65
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:44,072
You're the two most important
people in the world to me.

66
00:05:44,176 --> 00:05:47,668
I've never said that before, but it's true,
and I want you both to know it.

67
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,048
I love you, Peter.

68
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,344
Thank you.

69
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,645
I love you, Jack.

70
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,415
I love you, too.

71
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,989
How did it get to this?

72
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,115
Why haven't we spoken in a year?

73
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,488
Let's make an agreement.

74
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,618
- To do what?
- Okay.

75
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:04,389
A: I want us
to become brothers again

76
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,795
like we used to be,
and for us to find ourselves

77
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:07,888
and bond with each other.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,058
Can we agree to that?

79
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:10,499
- Okay.
- Yeah.
- B: I want us

80
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,036
to make this trip
a spiritual journey,

81
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,629
where each of us seek the
unknown, and we learn about it.

82
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,798
Can we agree to that?

83
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:17,466
- Sure.
- I guess so.

84
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,670
C: I want us
to be completely open

85
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,440
and say yes to everything,

86
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,071
even if it's shocking and painful.

87
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,479
Can we agree to that?

88
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,983
Now, I had

89
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:29,111
Brendan make us an itinerary.

90
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:30,279
Who's Brendan?

91
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:31,617
My new assistant.

92
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,022
He's gonna place an updated
schedule under our doors

93
00:06:34,126 --> 00:06:35,923
every morning of all
the spiritual places

94
00:06:36,028 --> 00:06:37,757
and temples
that we need to see

95
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:39,057
and expedite hotels

96
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:40,223
and transportation and everything.

97
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,561
How's he gonna do that?

98
00:06:41,667 --> 00:06:44,158
I had him bring a printer
and a laminating machine.

99
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,362
Where is he?

100
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,234
In a way, it actually
doesn't matter.

101
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,104
He's in a different compartment
on another part of the train,

102
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,006
but we never see him- ever.

103
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,339
That's more or less it.

104
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:54,572
Three, please.

105
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,147
Does that sound okay to you?

106
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:57,476
It sounds good, sure.

107
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:58,811
Yeah, it sounds good.

108
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,146
Do you have any questions?

109
00:07:00,252 --> 00:07:02,482
- I do.
- Okay, go ahead.

110
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,681
What happened to your face?

111
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,688
I only remember
certain details,

112
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:09,158
but from what I've been able
to reconstruct,

113
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:12,059
it was raining, I was going
about 50 miles an hour

114
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:14,655
as I went into a corner,
did some wrong steering,

115
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,634
wheels went out from me,
and I suddenly, whoo,

116
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:19,728
skidded off the road,
slammed into a ditch

117
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,034
and got catapulted
50 feet through the air.

118
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:24,132
Little particles
of glass and debris

119
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:26,177
were stinging my face as I flew.

120
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:28,542
And for a second,
there was just total silence.

121
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:29,706
Just...

122
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:31,248
(imitates wind)

123
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,409
Then bam! The bike crashed
to the ground,

124
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,180
exploded and caught on fire,

125
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:38,154
and I smashed into the side
of a hill with my face.

126
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:39,656
I was driving home.

127
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,693
I live alone right now.

128
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,991
Anyway, two joggers ran up
and started digging out

129
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,860
all the dirt that was
jammed inside my mouth

130
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:50,129
and my nose and my ears.

131
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,261
My brain had stopped,
my heart had stopped,

132
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,566
so technically I was dead
at this point.

133
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,767
They did all the procedures
exactly right,

134
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,777
as a result of which
I'm still alive.

135
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,369
- Boy.
- Wow.

136
00:08:02,848 --> 00:08:05,078
The first thing I thought
of when I woke up was,

137
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:07,778
I wish Peter and Jack were here.

138
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:28,640
Have you heard anything from Mom?

139
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,800
No.

140
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,309
Have you?

141
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,400
No.

142
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:36,140
Me neither.

143
00:08:36,248 --> 00:08:38,716
Fuck.
(mutters)

144
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:42,918
What's that?

145
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,546
Some kind of Indian muscle relaxer.

146
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,921
I got it at the pharmacy
next to the train station.

147
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,721
What's that?

148
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,386
You don't need a prescription here.

149
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,622
A type of Indian flu medicine.

150
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:52,993
It's got a tranquilizer in it.

151
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:54,259
PETER: What's that?

152
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:56,391
Strongest Indian
painkiller you can get.

153
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:57,469
It's for my face.

154
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,798
Be careful with that.

155
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:01,065
You only want to take one drop.

156
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:04,472
(woman speaking German)

157
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:07,637
- (speaking German)
- Shh.

158
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:10,614
I also lost a tooth.

159
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:14,978
You want to read a short
story I wrote in France?

160
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:16,554
(muffled): How long is it?

161
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:17,587
What?

162
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,715
- How long is it?
- How long is it?

163
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,156
Never mind. Forget it.

164
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,888
You can save it till after dinner.

165
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,897
You know,
maybe right before

166
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,469
whenever you're about
to take out your tooth,

167
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,094
you should say something
like, "Please forgive this."

168
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:34,638
Because it's, actually,
it's kind of...

169
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,037
Can... you... back away a little?

170
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,473
You just spit in my eye.

171
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,841
When was the last time you
were in America, by the way?

172
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,713
I don't know.

173
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:47,808
The funeral.

174
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,478
In other words, a year?

175
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,351
I have to tell you,

176
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,892
I support this relationship
not working out.

177
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,557
May I take your order, please?

178
00:09:58,664 --> 00:09:59,562
Let's see.

179
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:00,859
Do we want meat or fish?

180
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,194
I'm gonna have the chicken.

181
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,462
Jack, you want to try the fish?
I bet that's delicious.

182
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,502
And, Peter, the lamb?

183
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:06,935
A chicken, a fish and a lamb?

184
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,006
How does that sound?

185
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,004
Who wants a soup?
Raise your hand.

186
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:13,743
Are those Dad's glasses?

187
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,177
Yeah.

188
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:20,448
You still have
his prescription in here.

189
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,487
How can you see in these?

190
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,555
Three soups.

191
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,681
WAITER: Soup.

192
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,189
Could you not order for me, please?

193
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,319
What?

194
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,158
Order for yourself.

195
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,731
(women arguing in German)

196
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:39,971
(laughing)

197
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:43,007
What part are you on?

198
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:44,268
Nothing.

199
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:46,708
It reminded me of something
not related to it.

200
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,370
How's Alice?

201
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,176
She's fine.

202
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,012
She actually started
this company

203
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:55,086
where she makes these
little clay pots.

204
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,415
They're quite popular.

205
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:57,716
We sent you one.

206
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,621
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

207
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,125
Oh, thank you.

208
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,025
I want that stewardess.

209
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:12,899
(women arguing loudly in German)

210
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,599
(mutters)
These Germans are bothering me.

211
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,074
(speaking German)

212
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,943
Ladies! Please keep it down.
Lower your voices. Thank you.

213
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,245
Did I... raise us?

214
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,323
Kind of?

215
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,357
Hang on- I'm gonna ask this guy

216
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,019
if he can get me a power adapter.

217
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,301
She's pregnant.

218
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,303
Alice.

219
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:47,633
Really?

220
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,605
- You're kidding.
- No.

221
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,608
Uh, how long?

222
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,735
Seven and a half months.

223
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,406
So it's gonna be
born in, like,

224
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,415
six weeks or something.

225
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,417
I think so, yeah.

226
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,510
I'm trying not
to get too caught up

227
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,679
in it right now.

228
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,279
Don't tell Francis.

229
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,292
Brendan got the wrong voltage.

230
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,555
Your soup, sir.

231
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,531
Please forgive this.

232
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,157
(tooth clinking)

233
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,008
Hmm.

234
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:28,111
Is it supposed to be sad?

235
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:30,113
I think so.

236
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:32,615
Well, I'm not too crazy
about the part

237
00:12:32,718 --> 00:12:34,618
where I start screaming
at the mechanic.

238
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,778
That never happened.

239
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,788
The characters are all fictional.

240
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,790
May I take your dessert order, sir?

241
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:41,257
Let's see.

242
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,725
Do we want sweets or fruit?

243
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:43,886
I'm gonna have the pudding.

244
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,429
Jack, you want to try the cake?

245
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:46,998
And, Peter, what looks good to you?

246
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,999
The cookies?

247
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,001
He's gonna order for himself.

248
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,071
The cookies.

249
00:12:54,873 --> 00:12:56,431
Excuse me, I'm...

250
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,510
(clears throat)

251
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:05,915
Has he been rooting around
and taking things?

252
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,417
Maybe.

253
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,952
I think he's still in mourning.

254
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,885
Well, I probably
am, too, but there's

255
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,720
something kind of unethical
about it, isn't there?

256
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,054
Legally those glasses

257
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,094
belong to all three of us.

258
00:13:35,547 --> 00:13:37,447
(medicine dripping)

259
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,615
I'm gonna take this bed,

260
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:43,085
because I'm the oldest
and my ankle's fractured.

261
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:45,554
Peter, you don't mind climbing
a ladder as I recall,

262
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:47,557
so why don't you set up shop
topside?

263
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,889
And, Jack, you're a little bit
of a lone wolf.

264
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,225
Why don't you bunk out next door?

265
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,299
How does that sound?

266
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,033
Oh, sorry.

267
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,199
- I-I was...
- FRANCIS: Stand up.

268
00:14:03,308 --> 00:14:04,707
Brendan, this is Jack.

269
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,368
- Good evening.
- And this is Peter.

270
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,706
Hello, Brendan.

271
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:08,837
Nice to meet you.

272
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:10,005
Let's update me.

273
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:12,982
How's everything going back there?

274
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,643
- Pretty good.
- What does that mean?

275
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,015
I never heard back.

276
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:17,748
So try again.
What are you waiting for?

277
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,790
Well, I left a message.

278
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,826
Why are you smiling?

279
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,292
What do you think
he looks like

280
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:24,794
under all that tape and everything?

281
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,455
FRANCIS (muffled):
Brendan, what did I tell you?!

282
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:27,896
Well, I don't know
about his face,

283
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,934
but I think his brain
might be pretty traumatized.

284
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:30,967
Damn it!

285
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,129
Come down to this spot over here.

286
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:34,466
Call her again
right now

287
00:14:34,573 --> 00:14:35,801
and keep calling
every ten minutes

288
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,307
- until you get through.
- Okay.

289
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,637
This is urgent.
We're almost there.

290
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,302
- Okay.
- And once again,

291
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,811
so we're explicitly clear,

292
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,245
I don't want you
to mention this

293
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:44,906
or discuss it with anyone.

294
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,416
In other words, it's a surprise.

295
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,849
Okay.

296
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:49,750
Did you find me a power adapter?

297
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,755
Not yet.

298
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,757
JACK:
How long are you gonna stay here?

299
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,759
What do you mean?

300
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,419
He said till the end of the month.

301
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,429
Uh-huh.

302
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,396
Why do you ask that?

303
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,968
I'm just trying to know so
I can figure out my plans.

304
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,969
What plans?

305
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,470
I don't know yet.

306
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,632
Anyways, I've got my own
ticket, just in case.

307
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,971
Don't tell Francis.

308
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,409
Well, I'm not gonna stay here
with just me and him.

309
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:15,741
(door opens)

310
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,748
Is that one of Alice's pots?

311
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,908
FRANCIS: Oh.

312
00:15:19,017 --> 00:15:20,917
We should order some more of these.

313
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:22,145
I'll tell Brendan.

314
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,551
Okay.

315
00:15:23,655 --> 00:15:25,816
He has this disease where
his head is shaved,

316
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:27,255
except he doesn't
have to shave it

317
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:29,589
because he can't grow any
hair in the first place.

318
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,493
Don't... talk about it
around him, though.

319
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:33,860
It might offend him.

320
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:35,228
(window opens)

321
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,928
Are these Dad's keys?

322
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,370
Yeah.

323
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,874
You've got his car keys, too?

324
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,706
Where's those nuts at?

325
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,038
(buzzing)

326
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,312
(knocking on door)

327
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,515
I got it, I got it, I got
it, I got it, I got it.

328
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:34,387
Good evening, Mr. Whitman.
How can I help you?

329
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,256
Is it possible for us
to get some more

330
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,828
of those Savoury Snacks, please?

331
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,828
Of course.

332
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,296
Can I offer you anything else?

333
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,627
Um... I don't think so.

334
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,132
I'll be right back.

335
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,601
I forgot something.

336
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:14,628
(knocking on window)

337
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:35,182
You want to smoke a cigarette
with me in the bathroom?

338
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,225
You're crazy.

339
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:53,395
What's your name?

340
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:55,564
Jack. What's yours?

341
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,164
Rita.

342
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,834
You're beautiful.

343
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,974
Don't come into me.

344
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,927
Jack's got his own return ticket.

345
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,427
He says he might leave early.

346
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,826
What are you talking about?

347
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,363
Don't tell him I told you.

348
00:18:20,465 --> 00:18:22,023
Brendan's got all the tickets.

349
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,465
There's a whole itinerary.

350
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:25,035
Where is he going?

351
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,000
Air Italiano?

352
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:34,806
What the fuck is this?

353
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,403
I'm keeping his passport.

354
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:38,449
In fact, give me yours, too.

355
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,177
I want to keep
all the passports

356
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,912
so nothing happens to them.

357
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,214
I'm keeping mine.

358
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,790
No. I want to keep
them all together.

359
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,891
Why are you standing there?

360
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,591
I'm waiting for you.

361
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,100
Mr. Whitman,
the whole point

362
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,464
of us coming
out separately

363
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,003
is so no one sees us together.

364
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:01,129
Jack.

365
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:02,399
Jack.

366
00:19:02,507 --> 00:19:04,407
Right. I get it. Okay.
Good night, then.

367
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:05,703
Go back to your compartment.

368
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:11,782
Move over, please.

369
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:21,421
Where are the Savoury Snacks?

370
00:19:21,526 --> 00:19:22,993
Huh?

371
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,696
Did you just fuck that Indian girl?

372
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,392
What?

373
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,367
Sweet Lime.

374
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,460
Of course not.

375
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,164
I went for a walk.

376
00:19:35,273 --> 00:19:37,173
Something just happened.

377
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,053
- Shh!
- Who's he talking to?

378
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,459
No one.
He's got the code

379
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:00,463
to his ex-girlfriend's
answering machine,

380
00:20:00,565 --> 00:20:02,294
and he's checking her messages.

381
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:05,165
What? When... When did
he confide that to you?

382
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,467
Just now.

383
00:20:08,573 --> 00:20:10,302
Why am I not a part of this?

384
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:15,844
I've never liked that girl.

385
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:17,778
Me neither.

386
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,147
Anyway, I never trusted her.

387
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,841
I don't feel good about myself.

388
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:48,345
FRANCIS:
Okay. Let's make another agreement.

389
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:51,280
On the spiritual journey,
it's crucial

390
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,180
that we don't splinter
into factions

391
00:20:53,285 --> 00:20:54,343
or not include somebody

392
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:55,886
who has advice and may know better.

393
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:57,955
- Can we agree to that?
- Okay.

394
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,819
- What did you find out?
- Nothing.

395
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,825
Good.

396
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,792
She put this in my suitcase.

397
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:08,258
(all sniffing)

398
00:21:08,366 --> 00:21:09,924
Is that her?

399
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,764
Mm. That's her.

400
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,270
How did she gain access
to your personal belongings?

401
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:16,863
She came to see me in
France for 24 hours.

402
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:18,374
Could she be gaslighting you?

403
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,705
What's gaslighting?

404
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,278
Okay, hang on a second.

405
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:22,903
Let's make another agreement.

406
00:21:23,014 --> 00:21:25,107
From now on,
if you want to talk to her

407
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,243
or check her messages,
you speak to us first.

408
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,981
Day or night. Anytime.
Can you agree to that?

409
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,616
I think we should destroy that.

410
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:41,165
Jesus!

411
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:43,791
Okay. All right.

412
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,802
Let's check the itinerary.

413
00:21:48,173 --> 00:21:50,198
Give me a little light.

414
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:52,242
Okay, here we go.

415
00:21:52,344 --> 00:21:53,743
Train stops first thing
tomorrow morning

416
00:21:53,845 --> 00:21:55,403
for an hour and 45 minutes,

417
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,277
which is just enough time
for a quick visit

418
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:58,781
to Temple of a Thousand Bulls,

419
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,250
probably one of
the most spiritual places

420
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:03,583
in the entire world.

421
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,222
Wow.

422
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:42,259
Power adapters!

423
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,487
Can I get a power adapter?

424
00:22:45,597 --> 00:22:46,495
Yes, yes, yes.

425
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:48,031
Do you have a power adapter?

426
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,600
No, no.
No power adapter.

427
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,566
Use battery.

428
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,833
Do you have these in, say,
a ten-and-a-half medium?

429
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,840
These all size.

430
00:22:56,942 --> 00:22:58,671
Take off shoes and try.

431
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,005
PETER: Yeah, like that. That's good.

432
00:23:00,111 --> 00:23:02,011
Pepper spray. What ingredients
does this have in it?

433
00:23:02,113 --> 00:23:03,637
I don't want to kill
anybody or anything.

434
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:05,113
No, no.
Not for killing.

435
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,410
Spray in face.

436
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,179
Okay. Spray in face.

437
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,617
Spray in face.

438
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,951
(hissing)

439
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,888
Most rare, from desert.

440
00:23:13,992 --> 00:23:15,550
Very poisonous.

441
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,720
How much you want for him?

442
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,798
(bells ringing, people chanting)

443
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,869
This is incredible.

444
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,204
(bell dings)

445
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,045
(bell dings)

446
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:37,475
Ring it.

447
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,550
(ringing)

448
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,921
(ringing)

449
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,116
Take some of these
rupees and put them

450
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:51,195
on this thing in front
of the deity here.

451
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,864
(inhaling, exhaling deeply)

452
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:00,267
Is that my belt?

453
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,102
Can I borrow it?

454
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,267
Well, no, not right now.

455
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:07,345
I was looking for that earlier.

456
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,278
(grunts)

457
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:17,446
- Ask first... next time.
- Right.

458
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:19,955
Where's my passport?

459
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,286
I got pickpocketed.

460
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,621
My passport got stolen.

461
00:24:22,727 --> 00:24:24,126
Calm down.

462
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,560
- It's not stolen.
- No, yes, it is.

463
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,529
- It's gone.
- No, it's not.

464
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:28,860
I have it.

465
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,127
I'll be right back.

466
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,969
You stole my passport?

467
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,699
Peter, where are you going?

468
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:39,540
I'm going to go pray
at a different thing.

469
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,146
I hear you're leaving early.

470
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,378
What are you talking about?

471
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:50,317
I thought we made an agreement.

472
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,719
That's why you stole my passport?

473
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,586
Well, no, but I think
we have a chance

474
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,626
to make this kind of a
life-changing experience,

475
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:57,661
and I think we need it.

476
00:24:57,762 --> 00:25:00,731
In other words,
I don't want you to leave.

477
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,266
He's going to have a
kid in six weeks.

478
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,097
- Who?
- Him, Rubby.

479
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,068
- He doesn't want you to know.
- "Rubby"?

480
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,163
Yeah, you know, Rubby.

481
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,441
- Yeah.
- (chuckles)

482
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:14,603
Why doesn't he want me to know?

483
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:18,182
JACK:
Because we don't trust each other.

484
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:23,252
Wow, right?

485
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:25,788
- Yeah, amazing.
- Great, thanks.

486
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:27,517
Let's get a shoeshine.

487
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,858
Oh, hit it.

488
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,729
Hey. Hey, come back here!

489
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,569
- What?
- The kid just left...

490
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:44,972
- Who?
- He just...

491
00:25:45,076 --> 00:25:46,008
(shouting): Get him!

492
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:47,635
- He left his shoeshine kit.
- He...

493
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,304
Well, now he can pay
for this building.

494
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,211
Those are $3,000 loafers!

495
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,840
Yeah, but he only got one of them.

496
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,418
Yeah, but that's...

497
00:25:57,922 --> 00:25:59,321
We're in an emergency here.

498
00:25:59,424 --> 00:26:00,891
I got my face smashed in,

499
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,584
Jack's heart's been
ripped to shreds,

500
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,355
and Rubby's having a child.

501
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,163
Let's get into it.

502
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:07,424
You told him?

503
00:26:07,532 --> 00:26:08,863
It's okay.

504
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:10,457
Okay, that's what
we're here for,

505
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:12,058
to start trusting each other.

506
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,694
I don't get it, by the way.

507
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,103
Why aren't we celebrating?

508
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,902
'Cause I don't want
to talk about it.

509
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,102
Well, why not?

510
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:21,769
(sighs)

511
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,609
I guess because
I always expected

512
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:26,115
eventually I'll get divorced,
so having children...

513
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,775
really wasn't part of my plan.

514
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,911
Okay, but you're never
gonna do better than Alice,

515
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,420
and what's the point
in getting married...

516
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,787
Why'd you expect to get divorced?

517
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,860
I don't know.
I love Alice.

518
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,856
Maybe it relates
to how we were raised.

519
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,627
I was gonna save this
for later in the itinerary,

520
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,968
but I think it's time.

521
00:26:49,073 --> 00:26:51,268
There's a ceremony I want
us to do where we each

522
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,640
take one of these peacock feathers.

523
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:55,178
We're gonna go off
into the wilderness

524
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,304
and meditate for...

525
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,972
Damn it, I gave them to Brendan.

526
00:26:58,082 --> 00:27:00,482
That's all right, we'll
do it after the next stop.

527
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:01,916
Those guys are laughing at us.

528
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,920
Where?

529
00:27:05,857 --> 00:27:07,757
I love it here.

530
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,486
These people are beautiful.

531
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:13,164
They're playing cricket
with a tennis ball.

532
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,366
(boys laughing)

533
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,436
- (bicycle bell dings)
- Hello.

534
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:25,771
- How do you do?
- Hello.

535
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,104
It's great.

536
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,944
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

537
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:33,210
It's so well-written.

538
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,081
You remember everything so clearly.

539
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:37,450
Peter getting all frantic
getting the car started,

540
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,546
you with the suitcase.

541
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,249
The characters are all fictional.

542
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,486
Well, anyway,
I think it's the best thing

543
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,119
you've ever written.

544
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,595
Thank you.

545
00:28:04,415 --> 00:28:05,643
Here are the peacock feathers,

546
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,308
plus some instructions
from the guru.

547
00:28:07,418 --> 00:28:08,510
What's in that box?

548
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,609
He bought a snake.

549
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:10,847
It's got a skull and crossbones...

550
00:28:10,955 --> 00:28:12,354
Let's update me.

551
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,125
Anything?

552
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:17,990
She got the message, yeah.

553
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:19,154
And?

554
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,196
What? That's it.

555
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,890
That's it.
She got the message.

556
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,365
You're satisfied with that?

557
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,333
Well, she knows you're coming.

558
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:27,233
Does she want to see us?

559
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,704
But she's your mother.

560
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:44,279
Happy birthday...
from last year.

561
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:48,487
I can't accept this.
It's too valuable.

562
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:49,685
It's got one
wrong initial,

563
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:51,091
but you can paint over it.

564
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:52,253
It's from me and Jack.

565
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,273
(knocking)

566
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,283
Yes?

567
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:16,546
RITA: Would you like tea?

568
00:29:16,654 --> 00:29:17,678
Okay.

569
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,426
Thank you.

570
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,040
(folk rock)

571
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:59,786
¢Ü You talk like Marlene Dietrich ¢Ü

572
00:29:59,897 --> 00:30:03,492
¢Ü And you dance
like Zizi Jeanmaire ¢Ü

573
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,468
¢Ü Your clothes are
all made by Balmain ¢Ü

574
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:08,095
I got to get off this train.

575
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:11,232
¢Ü And there's diamonds
and pearls in your hair ¢Ü

576
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,902
¢Ü Yes, there are ¢Ü

577
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:17,743
¢Ü You live in a fancy apartment ¢Ü

578
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:23,116
¢Ü Off the Boulevard Saint-Michel... ¢Ü

579
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,984
What's her name again?

580
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:26,113
Rita.

581
00:30:26,224 --> 00:30:29,318
(Peter mumbles)

582
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,918
What'd you say?

583
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:38,963
There's a hole in it.

584
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,002
He escaped.

585
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,969
No, he didn't.

586
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,768
How?

587
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:48,903
(all yelling, gasping)

588
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,179
PETER:
Now-Now you believe me, assholes?

589
00:30:56,387 --> 00:31:00,517
We think a snake might
have gotten on board.

590
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:08,121
¢Ü But where do you go to,
my lovely ¢Ü

591
00:31:08,232 --> 00:31:10,496
¢Ü When you're alone
in your bed? ¢Ü

592
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:15,867
Don't go in there, Rita.

593
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:19,801
(snake hissing, Rita gasps)

594
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:20,809
FRANCIS: You got him!

595
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,846
(woman speaks German)

596
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,020
(speaks Hindi)

597
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:37,927
I'm kicking you off
at the next station.

598
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,360
Please don't do that.

599
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:40,988
We're very sorry.
It won't happen again.

600
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,828
I know it won't.

601
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,265
What's that smell?

602
00:31:44,368 --> 00:31:45,858
Voltaire Number Six.

603
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:52,738
Do you have
a prescription for these?

604
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,938
A prescription?
I almost died.

605
00:31:58,182 --> 00:31:59,206
Give me a second.

606
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:02,480
¢Ü Where do you go to,
my lovely ¢Ü

607
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,715
¢Ü When you're alone
in your bed? ¢Ü

608
00:32:07,058 --> 00:32:10,653
¢Ü Tell me the thoughts
that surround you ¢Ü

609
00:32:10,761 --> 00:32:12,490
That animal's deadly poisonous

610
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,224
and you brought him onto my train.

611
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:15,799
We didn't know.
It was an accident.

612
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,266
We're just trying
to experience something.

613
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:23,033
It's very important to us.

614
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,336
(indistinct radio transmission)

615
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,705
(speaks Hindi)

616
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,484
You're confined
to your compartment

617
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:36,780
until further notice.

618
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:39,721
Is our snake getting confiscated?

619
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,928
(music playing)

620
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,687
Do you think it's working?

621
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,418
Do we feel something?

622
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:18,256
- I hope so.
- It's got to.

623
00:34:19,423 --> 00:34:20,856
Do you trust me?

624
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,516
(loud thumping)

625
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:31,924
Where are we?

626
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:32,934
(door squeaks)

627
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:35,028
(speaking Hindi)

628
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,868
(speaking Hindi)

629
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,673
(clanking)

630
00:34:43,047 --> 00:34:45,948
(indistinct chatter in Hindi)

631
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,054
Brendan, what's going on?

632
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,926
I don't know. I guess
the train's lost.

633
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,192
What'd he say?

634
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,358
He says the train's lost.

635
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:05,367
How can a train be
lost? It's on rails.

636
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:07,630
Apparently we took a wrong
turn at some point last night.

637
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:08,636
That's crazy.

638
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:09,865
How far off course are we?

639
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:11,874
Nobody knows-we haven't
located us yet.

640
00:35:11,976 --> 00:35:13,136
What'd you just say?

641
00:35:13,244 --> 00:35:14,176
What?

642
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,836
What you just said.
Say it again.

643
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:16,913
We haven't located us yet.

644
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:18,276
Aah!

645
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,009
Is that symbolic?

646
00:35:20,117 --> 00:35:24,315
"We... haven't
located... us... yet."

647
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,753
Where's those feathers at?

648
00:35:25,856 --> 00:35:28,381
In the envelope
I gave you this morning.

649
00:35:28,492 --> 00:35:30,619
Meet me on top of
that thing out there.

650
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:51,972
The guru told me
when the moon turns...

651
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,816
Do you trust me?

652
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,454
I hired a private detective
to track down Mom.

653
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:08,532
She's living in a convent in
the foothills of the Himalayas.

654
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:10,224
We'll be there in six days.

655
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,947
How is that possible?

656
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,949
I guess she became a nun,
apparently.

657
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:28,040
You know what she's like.

658
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:29,084
A nun?

659
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,084
Apparently.

660
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:32,087
Did you talk to her?

661
00:36:32,189 --> 00:36:33,213
No, I didn't.

662
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:34,552
Does she know we're coming?

663
00:36:34,658 --> 00:36:36,125
I think so.

664
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,923
How do you know she wants to see us?

665
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:42,021
She probably doesn't.

666
00:36:42,133 --> 00:36:43,532
But maybe she does.

667
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:47,765
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

668
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,306
Because I'm trying
to protect you

669
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:53,434
from all the painful emotions
this is probably gonna stir up.

670
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,842
Well, aren't you kind of
doing that right now?

671
00:36:55,946 --> 00:36:57,573
Yeah.

672
00:36:57,681 --> 00:37:00,013
I'm scared, too.

673
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:03,348
She's obviously suffered
some kind of mental collapse

674
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:05,547
and we've got to go get her
and bring her back home.

675
00:37:07,057 --> 00:37:09,457
Actually, it's in the itinerary,

676
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,494
but I put it under "T.B.D."

677
00:37:11,595 --> 00:37:13,927
(laughs)

678
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:15,191
Why are you laughing?

679
00:37:16,934 --> 00:37:18,424
You didn't tell us
'cause we never

680
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,163
would've come here
if we knew about it.

681
00:37:25,342 --> 00:37:27,776
I'm gonna hold this in
for a little while.

682
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:32,178
(train whistle blowing)

683
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,768
You gonna drink that whole
bottle of cough medicine?

684
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:56,499
That's a dumb way to get loaded.

685
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,777
Let's look at the itinerary.

686
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,906
Fuck the itinerary.

687
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:07,483
(sighs)

688
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:10,748
You know, I think I'm gonna have
to get that belt back after all.

689
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:14,586
Because it cost me $6,000
and it was made special for me.

690
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,683
We'll get you a different present.

691
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,228
I don't think so.

692
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,389
What is that supposed to mean?

693
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,297
It means there's been too much
Indian giving over the years.

694
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:29,430
(knocking on door)

695
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,573
These guys are driving me crazy.

696
00:38:32,676 --> 00:38:34,541
Is there an empty compartment
I can move into?

697
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,740
No, there isn't.
We're fully booked.

698
00:38:38,849 --> 00:38:41,545
I really want to kiss you
right now. Can I?

699
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:46,751
No.

700
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,449
No?

701
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,221
But we already... did it.

702
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:52,295
I have a boyfriend.

703
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,057
You do?

704
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:56,997
Actually, I just broke up with him.

705
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,625
Or I'm about to.

706
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:00,897
(bell buzzes)

707
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:03,269
I really need someone
to talk to right now.

708
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:06,605
And I feel like you might be
very important to me in my life.

709
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:10,505
All right.

710
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,253
(bell buzzes)

711
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,987
(knocking on door)

712
00:39:27,097 --> 00:39:28,155
What did I tell you?

713
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,596
Get back in your room.

714
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,137
- What's happening?
- What do you mean?

715
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,104
- I rang the bell.
- I'll be right there.

716
00:39:37,207 --> 00:39:39,732
(chattering, music playing)

717
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:45,679
(dinging)

718
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,182
(music playing)

719
00:39:47,284 --> 00:39:48,842
(razor buzzing)

720
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:53,346
Is that Dad's razor?

721
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:54,446
Yeah.

722
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,048
Can I say something?

723
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,491
What?

724
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:59,722
You don't have permission
to take his property

725
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,060
that belongs to all of us
and use it for yourself

726
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,224
as if it's yours.

727
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:05,097
Jack agrees with that.
Right, Jack?

728
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:07,432
Plus, Dad would've hated it.

729
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:08,527
Why?

730
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,867
That's my opinion.

731
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,305
I knew him well.

732
00:40:13,143 --> 00:40:14,576
That's a terrible thing to say.

733
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,009
Well, I don't mean it to be.

734
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:17,876
I just don't want you
to get the feeling

735
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:19,745
that you're better friends
with him than we are

736
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,317
or something weird like that.

737
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:23,352
And, also, you can't
leave your wife

738
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:24,512
just because she's pregnant.

739
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,590
Jack agrees with that, too.
Right, Jack?

740
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,624
Stop including me.

741
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,523
I was his favorite.

742
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,188
He told me that with blood all
over him laying in the street

743
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:34,594
right before he died.

744
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:40,163
How is that supposed
to make us feel?

745
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,238
I want my passport back.

746
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,434
Francis?

747
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:47,805
Yeah?

748
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:49,208
Here's your belt.

749
00:40:54,151 --> 00:40:55,083
(growls)

750
00:40:55,185 --> 00:40:57,813
(grunting)

751
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:01,091
Fuck. Stop!

752
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,435
- You don't love me!
- Yes, I do!

753
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,439
I love you, too, but I'm gonna
mace you in the face!

754
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:18,940
Stop!

755
00:41:20,344 --> 00:41:22,869
(screaming)

756
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,709
(all screaming)

757
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:26,973
I had to do it!

758
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,574
Jack! (groans)
You maced us!

759
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,752
Stop including me!

760
00:41:33,857 --> 00:41:36,951
(screaming)

761
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:42,356
(glass breaks)

762
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:56,811
BRENDAN: I'll find us a hotel.

763
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,814
Next train's in 24 hours.

764
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,850
This just came in.

765
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,942
Why are your eyes all red?

766
00:42:03,053 --> 00:42:05,544
Why is your head so bald?

767
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,749
Because I have alopecia.

768
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,291
Oh, yeah.

769
00:42:09,393 --> 00:42:12,294
That's like albino, right?

770
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,421
Not really.

771
00:42:14,531 --> 00:42:16,499
Jack maced us.

772
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:26,807
Was I just mean to Brendan?

773
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:28,502
He's not coming back.

774
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:29,943
He just quit.

775
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,311
He did, didn't he?

776
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,940
Can we at least get our snake back?

777
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,609
It's dead.

778
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,346
You killed him?

779
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:41,754
Your fake tooth's gone.

780
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:43,759
Fuck.

781
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,658
(mutters in German)

782
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,094
What did you say?

783
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,960
Shame on you.

784
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:55,930
Did you get maced, too?

785
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:59,475
No, I'm crying.

786
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:11,219
What's wrong with you?

787
00:43:13,323 --> 00:43:14,790
Let me think about that.

788
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,792
I'll tell you
the next time I see you.

789
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:20,421
Sure, tell me then.

790
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:24,496
Thanks for using me.

791
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,572
You're welcome.

792
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,978
Good-bye, Rita.

793
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:42,108
FRANCIS: So long, Sweet Lime.

794
00:43:56,934 --> 00:43:57,901
(metal clangs)

795
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:00,564
(rocks clang against metal)

796
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:24,257
"Dear boys..."

797
00:44:24,361 --> 00:44:25,794
<i>WOMAN'S VOICE: Bad timing.</i>

798
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,194
<i>This morning I received the
details of your travel plans</i>

799
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:31,790
<i>in a document sent to me
from a man named Brendan.</i>

800
00:44:31,902 --> 00:44:33,767
<i>Unfortunately,
I cannot receive you now.</i>

801
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:36,396
<i>A neighboring village requires
our urgent assistance</i>

802
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:38,804
<i>due to an emergency,
not to mention the recent</i>

803
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,537
<i>arrival of a man-eating tiger
in the region.</i>

804
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:43,078
<i>I suggest you come
in the spring</i>

805
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,704
<i>when you'll be safe with me.</i>

806
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,407
<i>You must know how sad I am</i>

807
00:44:46,516 --> 00:44:48,746
<i>to experience this long separation.</i>

808
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,685
<i>I hope you'll eventually
understand and forgive me.</i>

809
00:44:51,788 --> 00:44:54,518
<i>God bless you and keep you with
Mary's benevolent guidance</i>

810
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,490
<i>in the light of Christ's
enduring grace.</i>

811
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:58,754
<i>All my love, your mother,</i>

812
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,921
<i>Sister Patricia Whitman.</i>

813
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,022
FRANCIS:
That sounds like bullshit to me.

814
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,566
- JACK: Me, too.
- PETER: Obviously.

815
00:45:04,668 --> 00:45:07,330
She's trying to sell us
a vacuum cleaner.

816
00:45:15,078 --> 00:45:16,978
(soft music plays)

817
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,411
Let's get high.

818
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,193
I'm sorry.

819
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,029
Me, too.

820
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,935
I wasn't trying to aim
for your face.

821
00:45:45,575 --> 00:45:48,874
Doesn't matter,
it's already demolished.

822
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:50,503
Let's just go home.

823
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:52,138
She doesn't want to see us anyway.

824
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:55,241
You don't think so?

825
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,252
Not even on some primordial level?

826
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:59,754
No.

827
00:45:59,856 --> 00:46:02,950
FRANCIS:
She's been disappearing all our lives.

828
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,292
We weren't raised
to be treated like that.

829
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:09,365
It's just not done.

830
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:12,958
Maybe this is how
it's supposed to happen.

831
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,197
It could all be part of it.

832
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:19,071
Maybe this is where the
spiritual journey ends.

833
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:27,372
You read the instructions,

834
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:29,111
right?

835
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:34,581
Okay, let's do it.

836
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:38,555
I'm gonna go over here.

837
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:40,687
Yeah, g... that's good,
get on the rock. Yeah.

838
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:42,526
- Yeah. Yeah, okay.
- Peter, you get... Yeah.

839
00:46:42,632 --> 00:46:44,190
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

840
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,632
- Ah! Oh!
- Shalom.

841
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:49,968
(all chanting gibberish)

842
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,667
Okay, that's it.
That's it.

843
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:53,902
Okay.

844
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,979
(quietly): Well, all right.

845
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,921
Which direction did yours go?

846
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:10,186
What do you mean?

847
00:47:10,293 --> 00:47:11,521
Your feathers.

848
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:13,095
Mine blew towards the mountains.

849
00:47:13,196 --> 00:47:15,756
That's not right- it's
not supposed to get blown away.

850
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:18,130
<i>You're supposed
to blow on it... (blows)</i>

851
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,600
And then bury it.

852
00:47:19,703 --> 00:47:21,000
I didn't get that.

853
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,628
I still have mine.

854
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:24,138
You guys didn't do it right.

855
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:26,141
I asked you
if you read the instructions.

856
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:28,837
You did it wrong.

857
00:47:28,945 --> 00:47:30,537
(sighs)

858
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:34,140
I tried my hardest.

859
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:37,015
I don't know what else to do.

860
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:42,754
I don't think Dad
would have hated it.

861
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:45,623
Did he really say
you were his favorite?

862
00:47:46,696 --> 00:47:47,958
I don't know.

863
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,760
I could barely understand him.

864
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:52,027
He wasn't really breathing.

865
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:53,864
I wonder if the three of us

866
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:56,165
could have been friends
in real life.

867
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,764
Not as brothers but as people.

868
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:02,538
Well, we probably would've had
a better chance, I guess.

869
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,111
Let's make another agreement:

870
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,378
We'll all come back here
in the spring when...

871
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,750
We're never coming back here.

872
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:15,154
Let's just find an airport
and go our separate ways.

873
00:48:17,994 --> 00:48:20,861
Wouldn't it sound great
if you could hear a train

874
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:23,865
going by off in the
distance right now?

875
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:26,595
- Not really.
- Probably be annoying.

876
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,684
(boy shouts in Hindi)

877
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,418
Look at these assholes.

878
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,786
(boy shouts in Hindi)

879
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:52,993
That's gonna tip over.

880
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,461
(yelling)

881
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:56,855
Go!

882
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,232
(boys shouting)

883
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,633
Get the little one.

884
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,240
Francis!

885
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,369
(grunting): Grab him!

886
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:15,375
Don't let go of me.

887
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:17,146
PETER: He's all tangled up.

888
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:28,758
(grunts, gasps)

889
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:31,561
Hang on, hang on.
I got you.

890
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:32,600
(loud grunt)

891
00:49:32,702 --> 00:49:34,727
PETER: I can't get him out!

892
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:37,602
(boy shouts)

893
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:41,109
- (loud snap)
- Peter!

894
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:45,276
(thunder rumbling)

895
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:47,509
(amplified heartbeat)

896
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:52,784
He's all bloody!

897
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:55,858
(amplified heartbeat
accelerates)

898
00:49:57,294 --> 00:49:59,194
- (heartbeat stops)
- He's dead. He's dead.

899
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:01,196
- He's dead?
- The rocks killed him.

900
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:02,526
You're bleeding like crazy.

901
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,361
FRANCIS: Peter! You okay?

902
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:06,367
I didn't save mine.

903
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:08,437
(panting)

904
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:11,900
What's his name?

905
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:24,986
(animal bleats)

906
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,056
(bell tinkling)

907
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:30,950
(speaking Hindi)

908
00:50:41,004 --> 00:50:43,472
- Papa! Papa!
- Hey!

909
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,632
(boy speaks
frantically)

910
00:50:45,742 --> 00:50:48,040
(man speaking Hindi)

911
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:52,281
(train whistle blowing
in distance)

912
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:57,249
(speaking angrily in Hindi)

913
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,515
(quietly): No.

914
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,963
(people speaking Hindi
in distance)

915
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:29,248
(quiet chatter in Hindi)

916
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:35,116
(men speaking Hindi)

917
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,969
(many women wailing)

918
00:51:54,077 --> 00:51:57,046
(women continue wailing)

919
00:51:59,349 --> 00:52:01,317
(men speaking Hindi)

920
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:10,959
(man speaks Hindi)

921
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,086
Thank you.

922
00:52:13,196 --> 00:52:15,426
(woman speaks quietly)

923
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,406
(speaks Hindi)

924
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:31,047
(birds chirping)

925
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:01,143
(man singing in Hindi
in distance)

926
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,584
(speaks Hindi)

927
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,654
(baby cries briefly)

928
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,692
(speaks Hindi)

929
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:21,495
(long sigh)

930
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,566
(wind whistling)

931
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:49,117
PETER:
Can you explain that I almost had him?

932
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,830
I lost him when
we went off the rocks.

933
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:56,489
He was too slippery.

934
00:53:56,599 --> 00:53:59,625
I had him the whole
rest of the time.

935
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,534
I want them to know that.

936
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:09,078
(bus idling)

937
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:22,315
What you doing in this place?

938
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,949
Well, originally, I guess,

939
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,221
we came here
on a spiritual journey,

940
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:28,661
but that didn't really pan out.

941
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,198
(door opens)

942
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,269
(music playing quietly,
indistinct chatter)

943
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,025
We're invited to the funeral.

944
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:03,962
Okay.

945
00:55:10,673 --> 00:55:13,642
(guitar strumming
mid-tempo intro)

946
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:19,942
¢Ü Where you going? ¢Ü

947
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:22,210
¢Ü I don't mind ¢Ü

948
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:27,153
¢Ü I've killed my world
and I've killed my time ¢Ü

949
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:29,418
¢Ü So where do I go? ¢Ü

950
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:31,858
¢Ü What will I see? ¢Ü

951
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:36,398
¢Ü I see many people
coming after me ¢Ü

952
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,332
¢Ü So where are you going to? ¢Ü

953
00:55:39,435 --> 00:55:41,528
¢Ü I don't mind ¢Ü

954
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:43,435
¢Ü If I live too long ¢Ü

955
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,304
¢Ü I'm afraid I'll die ¢Ü

956
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,468
¢Ü So I will follow you ¢Ü

957
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:50,808
¢Ü Wherever you go ¢Ü

958
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:52,779
¢Ü If your offered hand ¢Ü

959
00:55:52,882 --> 00:55:56,079
¢Ü Is still open to me ¢Ü

960
00:55:56,185 --> 00:56:00,713
¢Ü Strangers on this road
we are on ¢Ü

961
00:56:00,823 --> 00:56:03,951
¢Ü We are not two,
we are one ¢Ü

962
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:15,036
¢Ü So you've been
where I've just come ¢Ü

963
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:19,302
¢Ü From the land
that brings losers on ¢Ü

964
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:23,971
¢Ü So we will share
this road we walk ¢Ü

965
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:28,676
¢Ü And mind our mouths
and beware our talk ¢Ü

966
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:33,245
¢Ü Till peace we find,
tell you what I'll do ¢Ü

967
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:37,656
¢Ü All the things I own,
I will share with you ¢Ü

968
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,129
¢Ü And if I feel tomorrow
like I feel today ¢Ü

969
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:44,461
¢Ü We'll take what we want ¢Ü

970
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:48,128
¢Ü And give the rest away... ¢Ü

971
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:51,171
(orchestral classical music
playing quietly)

972
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,601
I can't believe you just said that.

973
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:57,077
Why not?
It's the truth.

974
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,545
He didn't really mean it.

975
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:00,081
I think you're all
equally grief-stricken.

976
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:01,548
Let's just leave it at that.

977
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:02,879
When does Mom get in?

978
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:04,112
She's going straight there

979
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,279
from the airport.

980
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,054
I want to pick up the car.

981
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:12,059
We're already late.

982
00:57:12,161 --> 00:57:13,560
Tell the driver

983
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:15,688
- to take a right.
- We don't have time.

984
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:18,767
- Let's do this later.
- No. I want to get it now.

985
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:20,165
Uh, excuse me?

986
00:57:20,269 --> 00:57:22,328
I'm sorry, uh, we're gonna
need to make a stop first

987
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:23,837
at this address.

988
00:57:27,043 --> 00:57:29,273
Go ahead- I'll be right behind you.

989
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,210
I think we should wait for you.

990
00:57:31,314 --> 00:57:32,281
Why?

991
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:36,443
Francis.

992
00:57:36,552 --> 00:57:39,020
Tell them we'll be there
in five minutes.

993
00:57:42,492 --> 00:57:44,221
(bell buzzes)

994
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:57,205
MAN: Hey, hey...

995
00:57:57,306 --> 00:57:59,501
Hey.

996
00:57:59,609 --> 00:58:02,806
Yeah, we're here to pick up
Mr. Whitman's car.

997
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:04,675
No, Mr. Whitman's car is not ready.

998
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:06,146
What do you mean, it's not ready?

999
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,308
No, we're waiting for...
a part.

1000
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:10,181
- A part?
- Yeah.

1001
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:12,083
Uh, I left a message
with his secretary.

1002
00:58:12,188 --> 00:58:13,177
No, no, no, that's crazy.

1003
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:14,688
This car's been here
for three months.

1004
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:15,849
He can't wait any longer.

1005
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:17,084
He'll have to wait another week.

1006
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:18,160
Uh, I left a message.

1007
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:19,558
Yeah, he didn't get the message.

1008
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,153
Mr. Whitman is dead.
You understand?

1009
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:26,933
Jimmy Whitman?

1010
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:28,435
Yeah.

1011
00:58:28,538 --> 00:58:30,062
What happened to him?

1012
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,141
He got hit by a taxi.

1013
00:58:32,241 --> 00:58:33,367
And it killed him?

1014
00:58:33,476 --> 00:58:35,000
Yeah.

1015
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,602
His change was scattered
all over 72nd Street.

1016
00:58:39,982 --> 00:58:42,450
Oh, you're his sons.

1017
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:45,043
Right. And we're gonna
take this car

1018
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:47,019
to his funeral, which
we're late for, right now.

1019
00:58:47,123 --> 00:58:48,181
Where are the keys?

1020
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:49,986
Peter, we'll come back
later and get the car.

1021
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:51,082
It's not ready, right?

1022
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,662
It's not ready.

1023
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:58,727
- (no audible dialogue)
- (indistinct chatter over radio)

1024
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:11,676
(engine sputtering)

1025
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:13,112
(backfire)

1026
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,878
The battery's dead, too.

1027
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:20,515
FRANCIS: There it is.

1028
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:22,784
That's the other one.
We found it.

1029
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,053
We're still waiting for a part
to come in from Stuttgart.

1030
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,093
Where's a battery charger?

1031
00:59:26,195 --> 00:59:27,162
What are you doing?

1032
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:28,628
- This one's mine.
- No, it's not.

1033
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:31,097
We need to take it home and
enter it in the inventory.

1034
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,191
I'm taking this suitcase.

1035
00:59:33,302 --> 00:59:34,963
You going somewhere?

1036
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:37,530
I don't know.

1037
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,473
Where's the goddamn battery charger?

1038
00:59:40,576 --> 00:59:41,804
Ah, aha!

1039
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,538
Guess he didn't read
my book in time.

1040
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:45,273
What do you mean?
In time for what?

1041
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,439
The envelope's never been opened.

1042
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:48,346
Oh, you mean when
he was still alive.

1043
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:56,758
WOMAN (over speaker):
Phone call for a Francis Whitman.

1044
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:01,626
Hello.

1045
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:03,130
ALICE: They want to start.

1046
01:00:03,232 --> 01:00:04,995
Send the car back for us.
The battery's dead.

1047
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,432
They can only wait ten minutes.

1048
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,128
There's another service after us.

1049
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:10,569
Okay, well, we might not
make it, then.

1050
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:12,664
I guess just...

1051
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,766
tell 'em to go fuck themselves.

1052
01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:16,708
Hold the line.

1053
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:18,144
No, you're going to start
when they get here,

1054
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:19,305
not one second before.

1055
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:21,906
Is that perfectly clear?
Is that perfectly clear?

1056
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:23,042
Try to be quick.

1057
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:24,176
Okay.

1058
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,652
- Wait a second.
- Yes?

1059
01:00:25,755 --> 01:00:28,121
I spoke to your mother.
She's not coming.

1060
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:29,623
She didn't get on the plane.

1061
01:00:29,725 --> 01:00:31,124
Why not?

1062
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:32,888
I don't know. I'm sorry.

1063
01:00:32,995 --> 01:00:37,728
Will you tell Peter and Jack, so
they don't expect to see her?

1064
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,267
Yeah.

1065
01:00:39,368 --> 01:00:41,199
ALICE: I'm sorry.

1066
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,932
Thanks, Alice.

1067
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,564
Thank you.

1068
01:00:45,675 --> 01:00:47,905
- RECEPTIONIST: You're welcome.
- (shouts)

1069
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:50,570
Put it in second.

1070
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,875
Put it in second!

1071
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:55,684
Pop it!

1072
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:57,514
(horn honking)

1073
01:00:59,121 --> 01:01:01,021
Watch it, asshole!

1074
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,521
What do you want?

1075
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:06,652
Are you kidding me?

1076
01:01:06,762 --> 01:01:07,729
Fuck, no.

1077
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,525
You get back in your car right now.

1078
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,224
Get back in that car!

1079
01:01:25,514 --> 01:01:26,845
This isn't gonna work.

1080
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:29,144
- Let's put the cover back on it.
- Let's go.

1081
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,516
FRANCIS: Come on. Steer it in.

1082
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,730
Let's go.

1083
01:02:05,087 --> 01:02:06,748
Who called?

1084
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:08,585
Alice.

1085
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:09,988
What'd she say?

1086
01:02:10,092 --> 01:02:11,286
They're waiting.

1087
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,021
Mom there?

1088
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:14,858
Not yet.

1089
01:02:30,479 --> 01:02:33,175
(chanting in Hindi)

1090
01:02:56,138 --> 01:02:59,369
(chanting continues)

1091
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:11,250
(flames crackling)

1092
01:03:34,110 --> 01:03:35,304
Hey...

1093
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:36,969
hey, help him up.

1094
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:41,339
You okay?

1095
01:03:48,557 --> 01:03:51,526
(music playing softly)

1096
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,654
(footsteps)

1097
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:40,640
(bus horn honking)

1098
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:53,085
(bus approaching)

1099
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:02,797
(brakes hissing)

1100
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:12,439
(praying in Hindi)

1101
01:05:21,650 --> 01:05:23,311
Let me help you.

1102
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:28,979
(Indian pop song playing)

1103
01:05:56,986 --> 01:06:01,286
¢Ü ¢Ü

1104
01:06:05,427 --> 01:06:07,657
(whistles)

1105
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:18,568
(metal detector warbling)

1106
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,181
Whitman.

1107
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:35,621
The flight boards in 25 minutes.

1108
01:06:35,724 --> 01:06:38,215
Let's set aside the next ten
minutes to use as free time.

1109
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,295
Do a little shopping,
have a snack,

1110
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:42,626
make a phone call, and then
we'll meet in the bathroom

1111
01:06:42,731 --> 01:06:45,962
next to that statue over there
at about a quarter after,

1112
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:48,298
get cleaned up,
brush your teeth,

1113
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:51,100
have a shave or what have you,
and in our last five minutes

1114
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:53,607
we'll sit quietly in
that little shrine over there,

1115
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:55,904
say a prayer and think about
everything we've been through.

1116
01:06:56,011 --> 01:06:59,208
(indistinct P.A. Announcements
in Hindi)

1117
01:07:01,817 --> 01:07:03,182
Three, please.

1118
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:05,253
(sighs)

1119
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,618
I love the way this country smells.

1120
01:07:07,723 --> 01:07:08,917
I'll never forget it.

1121
01:07:09,024 --> 01:07:10,685
It's kind of spicy.

1122
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:12,954
Who's he talking to?

1123
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,264
I think he's trying
to rehire Brendan.

1124
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:19,596
He said he's gonna
offer him a 50% raise

1125
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,863
plus some medical benefits
to help with his albino disease

1126
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:24,235
or whatever it's called.

1127
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,272
How'd it go?

1128
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,171
He's gonna think about it.

1129
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:29,403
He's gotta get hired
back, because otherwise

1130
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:31,809
I'm probably just a bad person.

1131
01:07:31,914 --> 01:07:33,541
And in some ways I
feel like Brendan

1132
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:36,243
might be my...
friend maybe.

1133
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:37,785
I'll be right back.

1134
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:44,718
He didn't really kill
our snake, did he?

1135
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:46,727
I mean, it's gotta be
against his religion.

1136
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,057
I bet he just sent him

1137
01:07:48,163 --> 01:07:49,357
out into the desert, which is...

1138
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:50,591
actually closer to his
natural habitat.

1139
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:52,098
Who's he talking to?

1140
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,594
Probably checking his
ex-girlfriend's messages again.

1141
01:07:56,705 --> 01:07:58,195
I thought we made an agreement.

1142
01:07:58,307 --> 01:07:59,899
Why didn't you stop him?

1143
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:05,876
What'd you find out this time?

1144
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:08,313
She's gonna meet me in Italy.

1145
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,543
Oh, man, that's terrible.

1146
01:08:09,652 --> 01:08:11,586
I know.

1147
01:08:11,687 --> 01:08:13,086
I'll be right back.

1148
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:20,391
Let's look at the itinerary.

1149
01:08:20,496 --> 01:08:23,465
(woman speaking on P.A.,
indistinct)

1150
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:39,847
Is that from Sweet Lime?

1151
01:08:39,948 --> 01:08:41,108
Who's he talking to?

1152
01:08:41,216 --> 01:08:42,513
I didn't say that.

1153
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:44,882
I didn't want... Hello?

1154
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:50,490
Alice, I guess.

1155
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:59,557
It's a boy.

1156
01:08:59,668 --> 01:09:00,600
It got born already?

1157
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:01,692
It's gonna be a boy.

1158
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:02,964
She had a sonogram or something.

1159
01:09:03,072 --> 01:09:03,970
It's a boy?

1160
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:05,040
That's incredible!

1161
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,107
- Wow!
- Yeah.

1162
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:12,504
Why were you yelling?

1163
01:09:12,614 --> 01:09:15,276
She's angry 'cause I didn't tell
her I was coming here.

1164
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:17,284
Ever?
Until just now?

1165
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:18,683
Yeah.

1166
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:20,618
But I explained everything.

1167
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:25,820
It's actually kind of lucky
'cause I got this vest.

1168
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:27,691
It can work with either one,

1169
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:29,821
but I think it's better for a man.

1170
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:33,891
(chuckles)

1171
01:09:34,002 --> 01:09:36,470
Here, he can inherit this.

1172
01:09:37,906 --> 01:09:39,965
It's from me and Jack.

1173
01:09:42,077 --> 01:09:43,908
Thanks.

1174
01:09:58,093 --> 01:09:59,720
Can I use those scissors?

1175
01:10:29,091 --> 01:10:30,786
(jet passes overhead)

1176
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:02,488
I guess I've still got
some more healing to do.

1177
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:07,192
You're getting there, though.

1178
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:09,355
Anyway, it's
definitely gonna add

1179
01:11:09,465 --> 01:11:11,262
a lot of character to you.

1180
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:33,621
What should we pray for now?

1181
01:11:50,138 --> 01:11:52,606
(engine roar drowns out
conversation)

1182
01:12:19,434 --> 01:12:21,664
¢Ü ¢Ü

1183
01:12:57,573 --> 01:12:59,666
(wind whistling)

1184
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:12,645
Didn't you get my letter?

1185
01:13:12,754 --> 01:13:14,984
I told you to come back
in the spring.

1186
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,853
Should we go?

1187
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:17,891
Of course not.

1188
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:21,292
Welcome, my beautiful boys.

1189
01:13:21,396 --> 01:13:25,093
Francie, Peter, Little Jack.

1190
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:29,400
What happened to your face?

1191
01:13:29,504 --> 01:13:34,999
I smashed into a hill
on purpose on my motorcycle.

1192
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:38,477
I'm sorry to hear that.

1193
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,138
There's so many things

1194
01:13:40,248 --> 01:13:42,341
we don't know about
each other, aren't there?

1195
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:45,885
Who's this?

1196
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:49,151
That's Oberoi.
He got us here.

1197
01:13:49,257 --> 01:13:50,849
(both converse in Tibetan)

1198
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:52,051
Whoa, whoa, wait a second.

1199
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:53,354
What are you saying to him?

1200
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:55,396
I'm telling him
to lock up your horses.

1201
01:13:55,497 --> 01:13:56,555
There's a tiger.

1202
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:57,893
Really? We thought
that was bullshit.

1203
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,434
You call that bullshit?

1204
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:05,638
He ate one of the Sister's brothers.

1205
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,470
(brothers laugh)

1206
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:09,043
I'm not kidding.

1207
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:11,442
¢Ü Praise him ¢Ü

1208
01:14:11,546 --> 01:14:16,950
¢Ü Praise him, praise him
in the morning ¢Ü

1209
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:21,250
¢Ü Praise him
when the sun goes down ¢Ü

1210
01:14:21,356 --> 01:14:25,816
¢Ü Love him, love him ¢Ü

1211
01:14:25,927 --> 01:14:30,694
¢Ü Love him in the morning,
love him in the noontime ¢Ü

1212
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:35,065
¢Ü Love him, love him. ¢Ü

1213
01:14:35,203 --> 01:14:36,693
(bell tolling)

1214
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:47,141
What do we want for breakfast?

1215
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:48,682
Jack, you'll like
the porridge,

1216
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:51,776
Peter, fresh mango, and
cornflakes for you, Francie.

1217
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:54,378
Now who wants scrambled
eggs? Raise your hand.

1218
01:14:56,324 --> 01:14:59,157
What's on fire in that
hideous little flowerpot?

1219
01:14:59,261 --> 01:15:00,489
Alice made that.

1220
01:15:00,595 --> 01:15:01,926
Oh, it's darling.

1221
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,361
Tell her I said so.

1222
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:04,625
Okay.
You want one?

1223
01:15:04,733 --> 01:15:06,291
Of course I do.

1224
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:10,132
¢Ü Everybody knows ¢Ü

1225
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:12,536
¢Ü But don't play with me ¢Ü

1226
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:13,767
(music box tinkling)

1227
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:16,537
¢Ü 'Cause you're playing
with fire ¢Ü

1228
01:15:19,047 --> 01:15:21,277
¢Ü Your mother, she's... ¢Ü

1229
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:24,717
PETER: Mom?

1230
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:25,787
Uh-huh?

1231
01:15:27,255 --> 01:15:29,155
There's one last thing.

1232
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:43,671
I want to tell you about my son.

1233
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:45,034
What son?

1234
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:46,936
The one I'm gonna have next month.

1235
01:15:48,737 --> 01:15:50,136
Well, you should be with Alice.

1236
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:52,434
You should have been
at Dad's funeral.

1237
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:55,704
So that's why you came here.

1238
01:15:55,811 --> 01:15:57,938
We came here because we miss you.

1239
01:15:58,047 --> 01:15:59,708
I miss you, too.

1240
01:15:59,815 --> 01:16:01,874
But why didn't you
come to Dad's funeral?

1241
01:16:02,985 --> 01:16:05,249
Because I didn't want to.

1242
01:16:06,922 --> 01:16:09,390
Why are we talking this way?

1243
01:16:09,491 --> 01:16:11,152
What's wrong with us?

1244
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:12,158
We should be celebrating.

1245
01:16:12,261 --> 01:16:13,728
What are you doing here?

1246
01:16:13,829 --> 01:16:15,763
I live here.

1247
01:16:15,864 --> 01:16:16,888
These people need me.

1248
01:16:16,999 --> 01:16:18,694
What about us?

1249
01:16:26,842 --> 01:16:28,742
You're talking to her.

1250
01:16:28,844 --> 01:16:31,039
You're talking to someone else.

1251
01:16:31,146 --> 01:16:32,545
You're not talking to me.

1252
01:16:32,648 --> 01:16:34,741
I don't know the answers
to these questions

1253
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:37,284
and I don't see myself this way.

1254
01:16:37,386 --> 01:16:38,318
Listen.

1255
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:41,651
I'm sorry we lost your father.

1256
01:16:43,058 --> 01:16:46,152
We'll never get over it,
but it's okay.

1257
01:16:46,261 --> 01:16:48,422
There are greater forces at work.

1258
01:16:48,530 --> 01:16:54,366
Yes, the past happened,
but it's over, isn't it?

1259
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:56,199
Not for us.

1260
01:17:03,345 --> 01:17:05,745
I told you not to come here.

1261
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:18,759
Maybe we could express
ourselves more fully

1262
01:17:18,861 --> 01:17:21,853
if we say it without words.

1263
01:17:27,002 --> 01:17:29,436
Should we try that?

1264
01:17:31,573 --> 01:17:33,507
¢Ü ¢Ü

1265
01:17:39,248 --> 01:17:42,274
¢Ü Well, you've got
your diamond ¢Ü

1266
01:17:42,384 --> 01:17:46,320
¢Ü And you've got
your pretty clothes ¢Ü

1267
01:17:46,422 --> 01:17:50,654
¢Ü And the chauffeur drives
your cars ¢Ü

1268
01:17:50,759 --> 01:17:54,820
¢Ü You let everybody know ¢Ü

1269
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:58,457
¢Ü But don't play with me ¢Ü

1270
01:17:58,567 --> 01:18:00,933
¢Ü 'Cause you're playing
with fire ¢Ü

1271
01:18:04,673 --> 01:18:07,836
¢Ü Your mother,
she's an heiress ¢Ü

1272
01:18:07,943 --> 01:18:10,969
¢Ü Owns a block
in St.John's Wood ¢Ü

1273
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,411
(thunder crashing)

1274
01:18:12,514 --> 01:18:17,918
¢Ü And your father'd be there
with her ¢Ü

1275
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:21,183
¢Ü If he only could ¢Ü

1276
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:24,623
¢Ü But don't play with me ¢Ü

1277
01:18:24,726 --> 01:18:26,284
¢Ü 'Cause you're playing
with fire ¢Ü

1278
01:18:26,395 --> 01:18:28,056
(snake hissing)

1279
01:18:39,875 --> 01:18:43,367
¢Ü Her old man took
her diamonds ¢Ü

1280
01:18:43,479 --> 01:18:47,939
¢Ü And tiaras by the score ¢Ü

1281
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:52,111
¢Ü Now she gets her kicks
in Stepney ¢Ü

1282
01:18:52,221 --> 01:18:56,681
¢Ü Not in Knightsbridge anymore ¢Ü

1283
01:18:56,792 --> 01:19:00,489
¢Ü So don't you play with me ¢Ü

1284
01:19:00,596 --> 01:19:03,087
¢Ü 'Cause you're playing
with fire ¢Ü

1285
01:19:05,701 --> 01:19:09,330
¢Ü So don't you play with me ¢Ü

1286
01:19:09,438 --> 01:19:12,430
¢Ü 'Cause you're playing
with fire ¢Ü

1287
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:14,441
(tiger growling)

1288
01:19:14,543 --> 01:19:18,104
¢Ü So don't you play with me ¢Ü

1289
01:19:18,213 --> 01:19:21,410
¢Ü 'Cause you're playing
with fire. ¢Ü

1290
01:19:21,517 --> 01:19:23,212
All right, let's make an agreement.

1291
01:19:23,318 --> 01:19:25,513
A: We'll get an early start
tomorrow morning

1292
01:19:25,621 --> 01:19:27,748
and try to enjoy
each other's company here

1293
01:19:27,856 --> 01:19:29,380
in this beautiful place.

1294
01:19:29,491 --> 01:19:31,823
B: We'll stop feeling sorry
for ourselves.

1295
01:19:31,927 --> 01:19:33,519
It's not very attractive.

1296
01:19:33,629 --> 01:19:35,927
C: We'll make our plans
for the future.

1297
01:19:36,031 --> 01:19:36,998
Can we agree to that?

1298
01:19:37,099 --> 01:19:38,327
- Sure.
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1299
01:19:43,438 --> 01:19:44,962
To be continued.

1300
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:02,179
(birds chirping)

1301
01:20:05,594 --> 01:20:06,959
Good morning.

1302
01:20:07,062 --> 01:20:08,791
She's gone.

1303
01:20:08,897 --> 01:20:10,228
What?

1304
01:20:10,332 --> 01:20:11,959
She's gone.

1305
01:20:12,067 --> 01:20:14,627
I was still asleep,
but Oberoi saw her go.

1306
01:20:17,739 --> 01:20:18,967
Peter.

1307
01:20:19,074 --> 01:20:20,166
What?

1308
01:20:20,275 --> 01:20:21,469
She's gone.

1309
01:20:21,577 --> 01:20:23,044
Who?

1310
01:20:25,814 --> 01:20:28,339
She's gone?

1311
01:20:28,450 --> 01:20:29,815
Where?

1312
01:20:29,918 --> 01:20:31,317
They couldn't say.

1313
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:33,445
They just said she
goes away sometimes.

1314
01:20:33,555 --> 01:20:35,955
She left our breakfast
in the doorway.

1315
01:21:46,928 --> 01:21:48,486
Whoo!

1316
01:21:56,271 --> 01:21:57,738
Zip!

1317
01:22:07,215 --> 01:22:08,682
Pshew!

1318
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:54,387
I'm working on a new short story.

1319
01:22:54,496 --> 01:22:56,828
I wrote the ending, but I
don't know how it starts.

1320
01:22:56,932 --> 01:22:58,399
Read us what you got.

1321
01:22:59,768 --> 01:23:01,702
"'Whatever happens
in the end,' she said,

1322
01:23:01,803 --> 01:23:03,828
"'I don't want to lose
you as my friend.'

1323
01:23:03,939 --> 01:23:04,963
"He looked into her eyes.

1324
01:23:05,073 --> 01:23:06,597
"'I promise I will never
be your friend,

1325
01:23:06,708 --> 01:23:08,369
"no matter what, ever.'

1326
01:23:08,477 --> 01:23:09,774
"Her voice cracked.

1327
01:23:09,878 --> 01:23:11,675
"'If we fuck, I'm gonna
feel like shit tomorrow.'

1328
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,042
"'That's okay with me,' he said.

1329
01:23:13,148 --> 01:23:14,672
"He lifted her shirt over her head.

1330
01:23:14,783 --> 01:23:16,182
"'I love you,' she said.

1331
01:23:16,284 --> 01:23:17,717
"'I never hurt you on purpose.'

1332
01:23:17,819 --> 01:23:19,184
"He nodded.
'I don't care.'

1333
01:23:19,287 --> 01:23:22,256
He would not be going to Italy."

1334
01:23:22,357 --> 01:23:23,847
That sound okay?

1335
01:23:23,959 --> 01:23:26,427
Yeah. It's hard for me
to judge the ending

1336
01:23:26,528 --> 01:23:28,257
without knowing the rest of it.

1337
01:23:28,363 --> 01:23:30,092
I like how mean you are.

1338
01:23:30,198 --> 01:23:32,029
Well, the characters are all...

1339
01:23:33,535 --> 01:23:35,162
Thanks.

1340
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:43,077
That's our train.

1341
01:23:52,387 --> 01:23:53,854
Hurry!

1342
01:23:57,759 --> 01:24:00,887
Dad's bags aren't gonna make it!

1343
01:24:00,996 --> 01:24:02,258
(chuckling)

1344
01:24:02,364 --> 01:24:04,992
(rock song playing)

1345
01:24:07,102 --> 01:24:09,070
¢Ü I know a man,
he's a powerful man ¢Ü

1346
01:24:09,171 --> 01:24:12,038
¢Ü Got the people in his power
in the palm of his hand ¢Ü

1347
01:24:16,912 --> 01:24:19,472
¢Ü He started at the bottom
and he worked his way up ¢Ü

1348
01:24:19,581 --> 01:24:22,015
¢Ü Now he's never gonna stop
until he reaches the top ¢Ü

1349
01:24:26,388 --> 01:24:29,653
¢Ü It's the same old story ¢Ü

1350
01:24:33,228 --> 01:24:36,163
¢Ü It's the same old dream ¢Ü

1351
01:24:36,264 --> 01:24:41,361
¢Ü It's power, man, power, man,
and all that it can bring ¢Ü

1352
01:24:44,206 --> 01:24:46,572
¢Ü If you want your money,
better stand in the line ¢Ü

1353
01:24:46,675 --> 01:24:48,438
¢Ü But you'll only end up
picking up ¢Ü

1354
01:24:48,543 --> 01:24:50,511
¢Ü The nickels and dimes. ¢Ü

1355
01:25:01,256 --> 01:25:02,655
(knocking on door)

1356
01:25:05,527 --> 01:25:06,926
Good morning. Whitman?

1357
01:25:07,028 --> 01:25:08,086
Uh-huh.

1358
01:25:08,196 --> 01:25:09,663
May I see your ticket,
please?

1359
01:25:14,870 --> 01:25:16,132
Welcome aboard.

1360
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:17,136
Thank you.

1361
01:25:17,239 --> 01:25:18,206
Thank you.

1362
01:25:18,306 --> 01:25:19,796
Sweet lime?

1363
01:25:21,543 --> 01:25:23,010
Why not?

1364
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:46,629
Why don't you hang onto mine?

1365
01:25:50,205 --> 01:25:52,298
It's safer if you keep them.

1366
01:26:08,023 --> 01:26:10,423
Let's go get a drink
and smoke a cigarette.

1367
01:26:10,525 --> 01:26:14,359
¢ÜJe m'baladais sur I'avenue
le coeur ouvert a I'inconnu ¢Ü

1368
01:26:14,462 --> 01:26:18,626
¢ÜJ'avais envie de dire bonjour
a n'importe qui ¢Ü

1369
01:26:18,733 --> 01:26:22,931
¢Ü N'importe qui et ce fut toi,
je t'ai dit n'importe quoi ¢Ü

1370
01:26:23,038 --> 01:26:27,270
¢Ü II suffisait de te parler,
pour t'apprivoiser ¢Ü

1371
01:26:27,375 --> 01:26:36,044
¢Ü Aux Champs-Elysees,
aux Champs-Elysees ¢Ü

1372
01:26:36,151 --> 01:26:40,349
¢Ü Au soleil, sous la pluie,

1373

¢Ü II y a tout ce que vous

1374
01:26:44,659 --> 01:26:48,618
¢Ü Tu m'as dit "J'ai rendez-vous
dans un sous-sol avec des fous ¢Ü

1375
01:26:48,730 --> 01:26:52,996
¢Ü Qui vivent la guitare

1376
01:26:53,101 --> 01:26:57,265
¢Ü Alors je t'ai accompagnee,
