61
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:28,115
* And I can't take this anymore

62
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,349

would think that
these were yours.

64

You did something
different to your hair?

65
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,596
You should think about it.

What are you doing out here?

- My insurance doesn't
cover hormones!

00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:24,972
Come on.

your sister with you.

- I don't have to go.

99
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:11,719
- I think you should go.

100
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:14,421
I think it'd be good for you
to spend some time together.

101
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:18,892
- You know what, we'll
be waiting in the car.

102
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,194
- Why are you
trying to punish me?

103
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:24,865

trying to punish me.

- Thanks dad.

111
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:59,800
This is so embarrassing.

112
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,291
Are you gonna hang
on me all night?

113
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:28,461
- Well yeah, of course,
isn't that what sisters do?

114
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,132
- Well hey there's Carter.

115
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,802
How 'bout you don't talk to him.

- Why not?

117
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:39,206
- Well I could start
with your hair,

118
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:41,241
but that wouldn't matter.

119
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,075
He's mine.

120
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,044
- [Samantha] Really?

121
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,145
- Yes really.

122
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,482
- Well maybe you
should tell him that.

123
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:52,219

You haven't even asked
her yet have you?

130
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:10,838
- I'm working on it.

131
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:11,772
- Right.

132
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,506
Where's she at?

133
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,475
- Right there.

134
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:16,376
* Baby move it

135
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:17,610
* Come on and work it

136
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,578
* Because I like it when you

00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,013
* Move it slow motion for me

138
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,248

141
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,151
* It's like you're causing

142
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:24,985

143
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,119

I had to deal with my dad.

00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,181
- No sweat.

154
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,883
Zane's still trying
to find a date.

155
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,184

156
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:00,153

158
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:03,390

00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,041
and I'll see you later.

168
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:21,942
- Not cool.

169
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,317

172
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,989
- She's bringing Devon.

173
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,726
- Didn't they break up again?

174
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:40,760
- Yeah.

175
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,795
I thought so.

176
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:42,996

- Really?

182
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,142
She wouldn't be into it.

183
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,413
- [Carter] Ask her you
homo, you need a date.

184
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:01,581
Hey!

185
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:02,415

- No, I don't think so.

191
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,960
- What?

192
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,794
- I said I don't think
that's such a good idea.

193
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,129
- Oh come on, you're
gonna have a good time.

194
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:16,964
I promise.

195
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:23,871
- Wow, wow.

196
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,307
- What's his face.

197
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,675
Zane told me about this
really cool haunted house,

198
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,010
so we're gonna go check it out.

199
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,211
- What?

200
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,812
- [Female] Yes
it's gonna be fun.

201
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,115
- Oh Sam this is Zane.

202
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,616
- [Sam] Oh yeah, I know.

203
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:37,918
- What, you know me?

204
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:41,021
- [Sam] Yeah we're in
the same biology class.

205
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:43,223
- [Zane] I take biology?

206
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,191
- You can ride shotgun.

207
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,425
- [Sam] Thanks.

208
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,966
- What are we waiting for?

209
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,301
Lead the way.

210
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,135
- Cheese.

211
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,137
* Trick me

212
00:13:57,137 --> 00:13:58,105
* Gotta come get me homes

213
00:13:58,105 --> 00:13:59,306
* Coming with me

214
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:00,540
* I ain't scared

215
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,408
* Yes I'm a warrior

216
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,176
* Yes I'm a soldier

217
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,346
* It's nothing like fear fear

218
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,381
* Fear fear

219
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,984
* Nothing like fear

220
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,220
(laughter)

221
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,088
- See the fun's
already starting.

222
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:17,324
We're having a blast.

223
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,092
- Oh, so House of Fears huh?

224
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,028
- Yeah, tonight's
gonna suck so much.

225
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:23,330
- Welcome to the House of Fears.

226
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:24,998
You are now on unholy ground.

227
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:27,767
A place where
nightmares are made

228
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:30,003
and your worst
fears are realized!

229
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:30,837
Inside--

230
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,172
- Dude, save it.

231
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:35,909
- It took me so long
to get that down.

232
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,077
- It was good.

233
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,346
Save it.

234
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:40,780
- Right this way!

235
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,884
Alright, so everybody's
afraid of something right?

236
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,586
The House of Fears
likes to remind you

237
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,887
what you're afraid of.

238
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,722
So there's nine fears inside.

239
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,724
Death, ghosts, monsters,

240
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,928
the dark, clowns, bats,

241
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,731
spiders, losing your mind,

242
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:03,103
and my personal Zane
fave, sharp knives.

243
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:05,805
(Imitates sharp knives)

244
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,941
- Are you sure we're not
gonna get in trouble?

245
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:10,210
- No Samantha, I have keys.

246
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,779
It's not a problem.

247
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:17,985
Let's go.

248
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:18,918
Move it in.

249
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,154
Alrighty.

250
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,090
Good, great.

251
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,128
- You're locking us in here?

252
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,562
- Yeah, I have to.

253
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,798
A lot of punk kids
trying to break in here.

254
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,400
- Isn't that what we're doing?

255
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,868
- Hey relax, the security
guy knows we're here.

256
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:39,339
- Damn, wish all mummies
looked that good.

257
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:42,409
- Yeah that's the owner
of the place, Sidney Neil.

258
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,977
She's overseas right now buying

259
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,213
who knows what for this place.

260
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:47,847
She's kinda got a crush on me.

261
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,050
Makes work a little awkward.

262
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,551
- She ain't bad.

263
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:55,388
- [Zane] Now kiddies, grab
your buddy, we're moving on.

264
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,925
Watch your step there.

265
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:03,830
- Ladies first.

266
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:06,333
Something wrong?

267
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,600
- No, I'm okay.

268
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,537
I just, places like
this just bother me.

269
00:16:10,537 --> 00:16:12,439
- You're gonna love it.

270
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,911
(Creaking)

271
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:20,747
- Alright, magic time.

272
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:27,220
Alright, everyone
watch your step.

273
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,958
Alright guys, so
there's a lot of

274
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,060
expensive stuff in here.

275
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,893
So don't,

276
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,730
I mean don't touch anything.

277
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,102
I'll be right back.

278
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,375
- So, what do you think of Zane?

279
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,378
- I don't know.

280
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:52,545
- Really?

281
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:53,646
'Cause I think
that the two of you

282
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,715
could totally hit it off.

283
00:16:57,384 --> 00:17:00,187
- Hailey I know you
don't want me to be here.

284
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,554
And I promise I will do my best

285
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:02,755
to stay out of your way.

286
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:05,492
But just please
don't patronize me.

287
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:14,234
(Buzzing)

288
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,239
(static)

289
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,148
- Hey, check this out.

290
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:29,349
It's mini Zane.

291
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,550
(Laughter)

292
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,984
- Dude, what did I just say?

293
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,386
Don't screw with the stuff.

294
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,923
- Shut up, it's just a
stupid statue alright.

295
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:38,658
- Did you open that crate?

296
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:39,592
- No.

297
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,494
- No, it was already open.

298
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,530
- Candice, no it
was not like that

299
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,465
when I left work today.

300
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,374
Zane to Hamadi, come in.

301
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,546
Zane to Hamadi, Hamadi come in.

302
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,948
Zane to Hamadi, Hamadi
I know you're there.

303
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:02,849
Pick it up.

304
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,789
Hamadi, it's Zane.

305
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,057
Come on I know you're there.

306
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,860
- Dude, talk to him later.

307
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,295
Come on.

308
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:18,131
Let's go scare some girls.

309
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,299
Dude, come on.

310
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,169
- Alright, alright, alright.

311
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:24,737
Let's scare some girls.

312
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:27,174
Would you put that down please?!

313
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:30,377
- This guy doesn't
shut up does he?

314
00:18:30,377 --> 00:18:32,745
- [Zane] Okay,
let the fun begin.

315
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:33,980
You ladies ready?

316
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,814
- [Hailey] I'm ready.

317
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:35,782
- Let's do it!

318
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,185
Back it out, no frowny faces.

319
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,397
(Ominous music)

320
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,107
I mean, this place is
state of the art right.

321
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,775
Everything is animatronics.

322
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:05,478
That way it takes less
workers to keep it running.

323
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:07,647
Monday's opening day so

324
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,418
hopefully we can get
all the bugs worked out!

325
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,789
You are about to
have nine of your

326
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,691
darkest fears realized.

327
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,960
You!

328
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,762
What is your darkest fear?

329
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:23,996
- My fear is that
we're gonna have

330
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,998
to hear that sucky
voice all night.

331
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,367
- Hey bite me.

332
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,668
Hailey.

333
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,770
- I'm claustrophobic
if that counts.

334
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,205
- Come on, you can
do better than that.

335
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,139
- Oh really?

336
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:35,708
What's your big fear?

337
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,477
- Being struck by
lightening in the crotch.

338
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:38,411
- Yeah he's right.

339
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:40,680
That would scare a brother.

340
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,250
- So Candice, what's your fear?

341
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,319
- Being suffocated.

342
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,922
- That's a good one.

343
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,190
Samantha.

344
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,126
- Makeup, she's too
afraid to wear any.

345
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:58,164
- And what about little Devon?

346
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:02,569
- I would say waking up
and looking like you.

347
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:05,004
- You could only
be so lucky bro.

348
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:06,005
Get in here!

349
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,750
Alright, now do you
remember what it feels like,

350
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,720
that feeling of pure
unadulterated fear.

351
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,623
That your mouth's
dry, stomach's tight,

352
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,592
hair's on end?

353
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:28,328
Shivers racing down your spine.

354
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:29,896
What door?

355
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,764
Oh what step?

356
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:34,401
Oh no, what corners
gonna come next?

357
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,635
And that's when--

358
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,671
- Hey numb nuts, just
open the door man.

359
00:20:38,671 --> 00:20:40,172
- Yeah cool, just
thought we were gonna

360
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:44,010
have a great evening,
but yeah whatever.

361
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,679
(Loud knocking)

362
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,950
- [Narrator] Welcome
to the house of fears.

363
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,453
As you wander the halls
of this building--

364
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,755
- What kind of
lame voice is that?

365
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,957
- [Narrator] Horrors
that you have only seen

366
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,626
in your darkest dreams.

367
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,994
- Actually it is kinda creepy.

368
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:05,832
- [Narrator] Enter,
at your own risk.

369
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:08,234
(Evil laugh)

370
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:11,504
- I think I just wet myself.

371
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:14,073
- Wow.

372
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,210
(Creaking)

373
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:26,252
- Entre.

374
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,557
(Screaming)

375
00:21:32,158 --> 00:21:33,760
That got you.

376
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,594
Oh my god.

377
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:37,764
- [Carter] Devon watch
out for the cobwebs,

378
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:41,534
it could mean there's
a spider around.

379
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,803
- Hey come on, push
like you got a pair.

380
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,572
- It's locked.

381
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:47,340
- It can't be locked.

382
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,174
Move over.

383
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,076
What?

384
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,746
I don't understand man.

385
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,682
It shouldn't be locked.

386
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,017
Oh!
- Oh snap.

387
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,455
- [Devon] Very sly Mr. Wonka.

388
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,791
- Well after you Mr. Wanker.

389
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:11,297
- Well I can barely
see anything.

390
00:22:14,434 --> 00:22:17,904
(Ominous music)

391
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:19,572
- Hey, look at this.

392
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:22,575
That's weird.

393
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,280
What happened to Zane?

394
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,117
- Turn back now
or meet your fate.

395
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,987
- Wait, how is he doing that?

396
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:37,657
- Candice, this is
your last warning.

397
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:40,593
Leave Devon, he is
a hermaphrodite!

398
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,765
- Funny.
(Evil laugh)

399
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,969
This guy is such a dork.

400
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:51,404
- Ah got ya.

401
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,105
- No, seriously,
how did you do that?

402
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,807
- There's a mirror
behind the screen.

403
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:56,108
- What?

404
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,577
- Yeah, so you stand out
there in the dark hall,

405
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:59,846
then you turn the
dimmer up on the light.

406
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:01,781
And then the mirror
picks up the reflection

407
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:03,883
and projects it onto the screen.

408
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:04,951
- Very cool.

409
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:06,553
- Yeah, really cool.

410
00:23:06,553 --> 00:23:08,621
(Faint growling)

411
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,022
- What was that?

412
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:12,024
- That's your next fear.

413
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,628
Ladies first.

414
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:18,297
(Funeral music)

415
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,504
- I don't get it.

416
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:28,641
Where was the
scream coming from?

417
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:31,410
(Loud thud)

418
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,780
(everyone laughs)

419
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,582
- You move pretty fast.

420
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,817
- I swallowed my gum.

421
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:39,552
- I thought you guys
said this would be scary.

422
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:40,487
Only thing I'm
scared of is that I'm

423
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:42,489
wasting a perfectly good night.

424
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:44,156
- Hey, you know what Devon?

425
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,858
I don't recall inviting you.

426
00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:47,026
- Yeah, whatever.

427
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:47,860
(Static)

428
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,530
(Devon screams)

429
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,633
- Well congratulations kiddies,

430
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:56,969
you made it through
your fear of ghosts.

431
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,805
Only eight fears left.

432
00:23:58,805 --> 00:23:59,806
Let's do it.

433
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,775
You, scream like a girl.

434
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:07,847
Alright, try to make it across

435
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:09,381
without touching
the old railing.

436
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,783
- [Devon] Man it
can't be that hard.

437
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:14,153
- 20 bucks says you can't do it.

438
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,088
- I'll take your money.

439
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:22,762
- Don't touch the rail!

440
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:25,231
I see Mr. Jackson coming my way!

441
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:26,799
- I'm still standing.

442
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,801
- Don't touch the rail!

443
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,570
Oh!
(Loud thud)

444
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,403
Yeah!

445
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,373
- Oh Devon are you okay?

446
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,584
Just take a deep breath okay?

447
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:50,757
(Ominous music)

448
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:52,825
(static)

449
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:08,374
- What's up with you and Sam?

450
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:10,242
- I didn't want her to come.

451
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,978
- She's your sister.

452
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,145
- Step sister.

453
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:16,749
I didn't want that either.

454
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:19,418
- What's the big deal?

455
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:21,053
- You wouldn't understand.

456
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:21,888
- Fine.

457
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:23,990
Whatever.

458
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:28,628
It wouldn't hurt you to be a
little nicer to her though.

459
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:29,461
- Yeah, okay.

460
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,297
You sound like my dad.

461
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,870
Hey, having fun?

462
00:25:39,105 --> 00:25:40,339
- Yeah a blast.

463
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,742
- That feel good baby?

464
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:44,510
- Yeah baby.

465
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,345
- Was that tunnel
too dizzy for you?

466
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:47,246
- I don't think
it's gonna work out

467
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:48,347
with you and Candice.

468
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,849
- Yeah, you think?

469
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:54,420
- Look, this isn't
easy for me either.

470
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,255
- You mean leaving your
school and all your friends

471
00:25:56,255 --> 00:26:00,159
to go live with a
step-sister who despises you?

472
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:03,830
- It's not you okay?

473
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:09,769
I'm mad at my dad for
marrying your mom.

474
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:12,071
Nothing against Lynn.

475
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:15,007
It's just not fair
to me or my mom.

476
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:19,511
- Losers can't be
choosers my friend.

477
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:22,114
- Oh you're so damn funny.

478
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:23,816
She's not my type anyway.

479
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:26,619
- Neither is Candice apparently.

480
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:29,455
- Well I don't see you
complaining about Hailey.

481
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:31,858
You know, you said you
weren't even that into her.

482
00:26:31,858 --> 00:26:32,759
- You don't know where
something's gonna

483
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:34,961
go until you try it.

484
00:26:34,961 --> 00:26:36,462
- Alright, well you
know what broseph,

485
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:39,832
if you think Sam's so nice,
why don't we switch dates?

486
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:40,667
- Okay.

487
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:42,969
- I wasn't serious.

488
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:44,771
- Yeah you were.

489
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:45,972
- Well no, Hailey's
not gonna go for it.

490
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:47,206
- And why not?

491
00:26:47,206 --> 00:26:50,509
We're just friends, she
said so herself right?

492
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,343
Ladies.

493
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,481
Zane has an idea.

494
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,249
- It's not my idea.

495
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:58,384
- We're gonna swap dates.

496
00:26:58,384 --> 00:26:59,618
- What?

497
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,887
- Wait, who said
this was a date?

498
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:02,454
- No, it wasn't
my idea, it was--

499
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,656
- Let's try it out.

500
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:04,857
I mean you don't
mind do you Hailey?

501
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:06,058
- Well--

502
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:06,592
- Wait, I don't know
if this is a good idea.

503
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:07,526
- Great.

504
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:08,761
You guys ready?

505
00:27:10,897 --> 00:27:12,098
- Yeah.

506
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:13,365
- Sweet.

507
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,200
Game on.

508
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,473
- Shall we my darling?

509
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,308
- Yeah no.

510
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:28,247
- This is a house of lame.

511
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:38,691
- [Sam] Why are you
messing with Hailey?

512
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:40,693
- [Carter] Hey,
we're just friends.

513
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:42,729
- [Sam] Does she know that?

514
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:43,930
- She's the one
who said she didn't

515
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,497
wanna be tied down
to one person.

516
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,799
- She said that to you?

517
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,367
- Oh yeah.

518
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:49,535
Yeah she likes to play the game

519
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:52,371
as long as the
rules bend her way.

520
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:54,974
Sometimes that's
not how things go.

521
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:57,710
- You know, I don't
wanna be your pawn.

522
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,011
- Sam, you're not my pawn.

523
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:01,613
- You are using me
to get her attention.

524
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:05,818
- Yeah I would actually
like to get to know ya.

525
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:07,319
Seriously I would.

526
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:18,197
- What is this?

527
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,366
- Scary nut house I think.

528
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:25,637
(Faint creaking)

529
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:32,178
(masked man moans)

530
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:34,847
(Devon laughs loudly)

531
00:28:34,847 --> 00:28:37,750
- [Devon] You just got
your ass kicked by a girl!

532
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,351
- Man, what'd you do that for?

533
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:40,686
- You scared me.

534
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:43,722
- Geez alright, well I
gotta go get cleaned up

535
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,491
and ice these baby's.

536
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:47,526
Carter, take everyone
to the mummies tomb.

537
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:48,961
I'll meet you there.

538
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:50,763
- [Carter] Alright,
straight down there guys.

539
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,698
- [Devon] Suck it up sunshine.
(Zane moans)

540
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:55,167
(ominous music)

541
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:57,669
- Where is this one taking us.

542
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,846
Everything in here
looks so real.

543
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:08,614
- [Carter] Touch
it, it won't bite.

544
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:09,448
- No.

545
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,117
- Go for it.

546
00:29:11,117 --> 00:29:11,951
- Okay.

547
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,156
(Candice screams)

548
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:17,990
Carter!

549
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:22,628
- That's wrong.

550
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:23,863
- That's gross.

551
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,167
- That's two.

552
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:32,972
After you.

553
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,115
- I think you upset Hailey.

554
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,720
(Faint thuds)

555
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,390
(ominous music)

556
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,136
(Zane moans)

557
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,707
(faint hissing)

558
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:09,541
- Hamodi?

559
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:25,157
- Your hand okay?

560
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:29,328
What's up Hailey?

561
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:33,832
- That's what I
should be asking you.

562
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,101
- Okay wait a minute.

563
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:37,036
Maybe I'm misreading
your signals here,

564
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:40,206
but I remember you saying
that we ought to date around.

565
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:43,242
- Well you can't just swap dates
in the middle of the night.

566
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:45,244
Especially not with her.

567
00:30:47,113 --> 00:30:48,948
- It's not a big deal.

568
00:30:49,882 --> 00:30:52,018
- Maybe not to you.

569
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:55,054
- What's that supposed to mean?

570
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:58,224
- Let's just get
this night over with.

571
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:11,670
(Loud thud)

572
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,406
- Hey Hamodi quit
messing around.

573
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:16,508
Hamodi.

574
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,649
(Clanking)

575
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:49,041
(ominous music)

576
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:51,944
- You know what this is right?

577
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:53,445
- What?

578
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:56,748
- You will be with
Devon forever.

579
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,151
(Both laugh)

580
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,356
- The house is kinda creepy.

581
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:06,025
- Yeah it's alright.

582
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:15,201
- Boo.

583
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:19,838
(Faint growling)

584
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:33,652
(faint growling)

585
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:47,033
(loud thud)

586
00:32:47,033 --> 00:32:48,534
- [Candice] Ouch!

587
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:49,868
- Hey, don't break it, you're
gonna have to pay for that.

588
00:32:49,868 --> 00:32:51,103
- The damn thing cut her arm.

589
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:53,939
Look at her arm,
she's bleeding man.

590
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:57,409
You alright.

591
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:58,544
- That shouldn't happen.

592
00:32:58,544 --> 00:32:59,711
- Well it did.

593
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:21,067
(Ominous music)

594
00:33:23,769 --> 00:33:25,104
(loud scream)

595
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:25,937
- Zane!?

596
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,041
- Oh geez that sounded real.

597
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,542
- Yeah it sounds like
he's screwing with us.

598
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,144
- Maybe he's really hurt.

599
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,412
Zane!

600
00:33:33,412 --> 00:33:35,013
- I'm tired of him and
his stupid ass pranks.

601
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,249
- No this isn't
something we planned.

602
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,584
Zane?

603
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:40,752
Quit screwing around man.

604
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:41,920
- Carter!

605
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,988
Are you okay?

606
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:45,724
- Zane!

607
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:49,295
- Is this another one
of his stupid jokes?

608
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:50,462
- It's real blood.

609
00:33:50,462 --> 00:33:52,131
- Yeah right, let me see that.
- What?

610
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,299
- [Carter] No look at it.

611
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:54,500
I know stage blood,
this isn't it.

612
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,967
- [Devon] This is ridiculous.

613
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:57,636
- I don't know, I
don't know it could be.

614
00:33:57,636 --> 00:34:00,672
- No, no, Carter tell
me this is a joke.

615
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,641
- I swear it's not.

616
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:03,842
- What are we gonna do?

617
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:05,010
- Look, Zane is just
messing with us.

618
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,778
Look there is no blood trail.

619
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,448
(Ominous music)

620
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,585
- Whoa, did you guys see that?

621
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:15,221
- What was it?

622
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:16,622
- I don't know.

623
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:18,090
I think there's
somebody back there.

624
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,491
- [Carter] Zane!

625
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,659
- [Candice] Okay this
isn't fun anymore.

626
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,628
- Look, don't overreact,
this so something

627
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:23,795
Zane would do.

628
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:25,997
- No, I wanna go.

629
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:26,832
- [Devon] Now?

630
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:27,766
- [Candice] Yes now.

631
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:28,667
- No, Candice, don't leave.

632
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:29,501
- Come on babe.

633
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,336
- No, let's go.

634
00:34:30,336 --> 00:34:31,170
- Candice!

635
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,003
Candice!

636
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,843
- Look, look, I
say we just go back

637
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:40,011
to your house and
make out alright?

638
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:41,079
- No, shut up Devon.

639
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,714
- Wait, wait, look, look.

640
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:44,082
I know you're scared alright.

641
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,851
But I'm here with you okay.

642
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:46,685
Know that.

643
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:49,488
- So what do we do?

644
00:34:49,488 --> 00:34:50,789
- We need to find Zane.

645
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,023
- What?!

646
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,760
No, this is totally
something Zane would do.

647
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,163
- He wouldn't let
it go this long.

648
00:34:57,163 --> 00:34:58,364
- Wait, you think
somebody did this?

649
00:34:58,364 --> 00:35:01,233
You think somebody's
locked in here with us?

650
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:02,501
- I don't know.

651
00:35:05,137 --> 00:35:05,971
Zane!

652
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,246
- You feeling any better?

653
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:15,581
- Yeah a little.

654
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:22,053
Kissing doesn't
solve everything.

655
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,655
- Hey, most things.

656
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:26,925
Hey I feel you right there.

657
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:27,759
- Devon.

658
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,495
- Zane?!

659
00:35:31,197 --> 00:35:32,198
Come on man.

660
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,734
- I will be so pissed
if this is a joke.

661
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,903
- I hope that's all it is.

662
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:42,674
- Devon!

663
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:43,809
- Come on now.

664
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:44,743
- [Carter] Zane!

665
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:45,977
- They're coming.

666
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,613
- Come on, just one more
kiss before they come.

667
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:48,814
- No!

668
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,081
You know what, you're
being a real jerk!

669
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:51,350
- Why do you care
what they think?!

670
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,784
- It's not about.

671
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,086
- What's going on?

672
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:57,155
- Dicko here keeps
trying to cop a feel.

673
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,824
(Loud thud)

674
00:35:58,824 --> 00:35:59,658
- Zane?

675
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:02,761
Zane!

676
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:06,064
(Static)

677
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:06,898
- It's Zane!

678
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,300
Get him down!

679
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,269
- [Devon] This is just
another stupid prank.

680
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,770
- No it's not, get him down!

681
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:13,439
Hurry, get him down!

682
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:16,642
- Zane, Zane!

683
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:18,510
He's not breathing.

684
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,611
- Is he dead?

685
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:22,581
- Okay what the hell
is going on here?

686
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:24,383
- Who would do
something like this?

687
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:25,217
- [Carter] I don't know.

688
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:26,051
- I'm calling 911.

689
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:27,786
- There's no pulse.

690
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,421
(Beeping)

691
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:30,489
- I don't have service.

692
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:31,457
- Here.

693
00:36:31,457 --> 00:36:32,891
You can use mine.

694
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:36,962
- No service.

695
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:38,430
- Yeah me neither.

696
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,998
- The walls must be too
thick in here or something.

697
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:41,633
- Look, who else knew we
would be here tonight?

698
00:36:41,633 --> 00:36:42,468
- No one.

699
00:36:42,468 --> 00:36:43,969
- Well some one must.

700
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:45,203
- [Carter] Zane set it up
with the security guard.

701
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,672
- Maybe he's the
one who did this?!

702
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:48,039
- What are you talking about?

703
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,676
- Who else do you think it was?

704
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:52,644
- Okay guys, what
are we gonna do?

705
00:36:52,644 --> 00:36:53,912
- I don't know.

706
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,914
Wait, where's the radio?

707
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:59,385
Hello, can anyone hear me?

708
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:01,420
- [Sam] Try changing
the channel.

709
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,522
- Hello, please,
if you can hear me,

710
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:05,223
respond, we need help.

711
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,659
Please, we need help!

712
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:11,830
(Static)
(low growling)

713
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,334
- What was that?

714
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:18,504
- Okay we need to
get out of here.

715
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:19,938
- Wait, we can't
just leave him here.

716
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,808
- Look, do you wanna
end up like him?!

717
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:24,142
- Devon's right.

718
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:28,013
There's nothing
we can do for him.

719
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,482
We've gotta get out of here.

720
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:31,950
We gotta find help now.

721
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,553
(Upbeat music)

722
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:39,057
(dramatic music)
(Candice gasps)

723
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,992
- [Carter] What, what was it?

724
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,093
- I think I just saw someone.

725
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,395
- What? Who?

726
00:37:43,395 --> 00:37:44,863
- I don't know, we've
gotta go another way.

727
00:37:44,863 --> 00:37:47,198
- No, there is no other way!

728
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,605
- There's hidden
passageways between rooms.

729
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:56,107
The workers use them to
get around backstage.

730
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,643
- Where are they?

731
00:37:57,643 --> 00:37:58,444
- [Carter] There's supposed
to be one in every section.

732
00:37:58,444 --> 00:37:59,645
Check over there.

733
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,450
- Here's one right
here, come on!

734
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,217
- [Carter] Go, hurry.

735
00:38:07,152 --> 00:38:08,620
(Fast paced music)

736
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,621
- Which way?

737
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:13,058
Which way?

738
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,527
- I don't know.

739
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,729
- What do you mean
you don't know?

740
00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:18,597
- I think we should go that way.

741
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:19,465
- Are you sure?

742
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:20,799
- Yeah I'm sure.

743
00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:28,206
- What?

744
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:29,040
- Turn around.

745
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,875
- Why?

746
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,109
- What is it?

747
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:31,910
- Turn around, there's
someone down there.

748
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,178
Let's go let's go.

749
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,719
(Clanking)

750
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,153
- [Hailey] Hurry!

751
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:51,697
- Guys!

752
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:53,699
Devon!

753
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:58,203
Devon where are you?!

754
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:03,375
(Dramatic music)

755
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:08,279
Hey guys!

756
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:13,885
Guys!

757
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,121
Devon!

758
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,623
- Guys wait!

759
00:39:17,623 --> 00:39:18,457
Candice!

760
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,359
She was right behind me!

761
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,828
- [Sam] Candice!

762
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:23,695
- [Carter] She must've taken
a wrong turn somewhere.

763
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:24,863
- We gotta go get her!

764
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:26,264
- But there's
someone back there!

765
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:28,867
- I'm not gonna just leave her!

766
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:37,443
- Guys!

767
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:39,177
Devon!

768
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,047
You guys!

769
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:56,728
Hey guys!

770
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:02,133
Devon!

771
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:14,312
Devon!

772
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:17,348
Hello?!

773
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:21,987
You guys can you hear me?!

774
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:24,456
Hello!

775
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:29,461
(Creaking)

776
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:30,395
No, no, no!

777
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:33,532
- Candice!

778
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:35,366
Candice!

779
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:38,369
- You guys open the door!

780
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,678
(Menacing music)

781
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,651
Hey you guys!

782
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:55,754
Come on, this is
seriously not funny!

783
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:58,189
Help!

784
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:02,027
Somebody!

785
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:03,128
- I hear her.

786
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:05,597
- Devon!

787
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:06,431
Somebody!

788
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:12,971
Devon!

789
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:13,872
- This way!

790
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,248
- No.

791
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:26,985
- Candice!

792
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:27,819
- Help!

793
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:31,289
Devon, can you hear me?!

794
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,093
(Menacing music)

795
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:41,166
- [Devon] Candice!

796
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:43,034
- Devon I'm in here!

797
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:44,636
- [Devon] Candice!

798
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:46,738
Man, I can't get it open!

799
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,141
- [Candice] You
guys, I'm in here!

800
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:51,910
Open the door please!

801
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:59,084
(Candice screams)

802
00:41:59,084 --> 00:41:59,918
Help!

803
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,793
- [Carter] Man, pry it open!

804
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:12,463
- [Devon] Hold on
Candice, here we come!

805
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:21,206
- We're coming!

806
00:42:32,017 --> 00:42:34,586
(Men grunting)

807
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:38,724
- [Sam] Candice!

808
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:39,658
- [Devon] What's wrong with her?

809
00:42:39,658 --> 00:42:41,159
- [Sam] Let me turn her over.

810
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,127
Oh god.

811
00:42:42,127 --> 00:42:43,394
Okay come on.

812
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,031
Okay, okay, it's
okay, it's okay.

813
00:42:46,031 --> 00:42:47,298
It's okay Candice.

814
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,466
Alright, okay.

815
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,369
No airs getting in.

816
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:52,671
She's not getting any air.

817
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:53,705
It's okay.

818
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:54,873
- Come on Candice.

819
00:42:54,873 --> 00:42:55,874
- It's okay.

820
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,545
It's okay come on.

821
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:04,349
One, two, three, four.

822
00:43:07,018 --> 00:43:09,020
Come on, wake up!

823
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,355
Come on wake up.

824
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:14,660
- Sam.

825
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:17,528
It's not working.

826
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:18,964
You need to stop.

827
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,332
It's no use.

828
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:25,937
(Sam sobs)

829
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,373
- We need to get
out of here now.

830
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:30,375
- This is not happening.

831
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,243
- Guys, listen to me.

832
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:34,312
We gotta get out of here.

833
00:43:42,754 --> 00:43:46,925
(Ominous music)
(faint breathing)

834
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,667
- [Devon] Come on hurry up!

835
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:57,235
- Still no service.

836
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:02,307
What is it?

837
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,711
- It won't turn.

838
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:11,349
- [Devon] Look, push it
in farther and turn it.

839
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:12,684
- It won't turn.

840
00:44:12,684 --> 00:44:14,352
- [Devon] Let me do it, move.

841
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:15,954
- I got it.

842
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:17,388
It won't turn.

843
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:18,356
- [Devon] Look, you haven't
got it in far enough.

844
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:19,725
Push it in and turn it!

845
00:44:19,725 --> 00:44:21,860
- [Carter] You know
what Devon, go ahead.

846
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,762
Give it your best shot.

847
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:27,432
- Damn it man!

848
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:28,266
- What?

849
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:29,200
Hey?

850
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,836
- You gotta be kidding me.

851
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:32,603
- [Hailey] What's wrong?

852
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:33,839
- He broke the key.

853
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,108
- It wasn't on purpose
now shut up alright!

854
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:39,210
- You finished?

855
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:41,346
(Clanking)

856
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,280
- Someone's in here.

857
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,648
- It's okay, it's okay.

858
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:44,482
Stay calm.

859
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:49,721
Okay look, there's a
phone in the workroom

860
00:44:49,721 --> 00:44:52,057
we can call someone from there.

861
00:44:52,057 --> 00:44:54,960
Just stay close
and follow me okay.

862
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,363
The phones gone.

863
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:01,666
- Try paging it.

864
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,872
- Anybody hear it?

865
00:45:08,974 --> 00:45:11,509
Okay guys, we gotta
figure something out.

866
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:13,478
- Like what the hell
is there to talk about?

867
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:14,712
Somebody's in here with us

868
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,681
and we need to get
out now, that's it.

869
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:17,515
- I know.

870
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:21,086
- You think this thing works?

871
00:45:21,086 --> 00:45:25,256
- [Carter] I don't know, you
think it's got the internet?

872
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,229
- I need the password.

873
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:33,398
- Well what's the owners name?

874
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:34,232
- Sydney.

875
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,166
- Try that.

876
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:41,239
- [Devon] Try house of fears.

877
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:44,542
- Halloween.

878
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:50,515
- [Sam] This isn't working.

879
00:45:56,187 --> 00:45:57,588
Come on, come on.

880
00:45:58,556 --> 00:45:59,390
Damn it.

881
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,596
- [Hailey] And just what do
you plan on doing with that?

882
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,631
- [Devon] What do you think?

883
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:07,866
I'm covering my ass.

884
00:46:07,866 --> 00:46:09,868
- Okay here we go.

885
00:46:09,868 --> 00:46:11,336
There's another way out of here.

886
00:46:11,336 --> 00:46:12,437
- Where?

887
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:13,538
- Right here.

888
00:46:14,739 --> 00:46:16,975
- How do we get there?

889
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:17,909
- Alright we're
gonna have to follow

890
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:19,410
the passage ways I guess.

891
00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:20,678
And then we'll have to cut
through the spooky alley

892
00:46:20,678 --> 00:46:22,547
and a few places.

893
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:25,450
- No, no we're not
going back in there.

894
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,518
Can't we just stay
in the passage ways?

895
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:28,653
What about along here?

896
00:46:28,653 --> 00:46:29,888
- [Carter] I don't know.

897
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:31,022
The passage ways,
they pretty much

898
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:32,790
go from room to room.

899
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,759
Or they're dead ends.

900
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:36,461
Guys we're gonna have to go
through some of the rooms.

901
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:39,164
- Fine, let's just get the
hell out of here alright?

902
00:46:39,164 --> 00:46:40,398
- Okay.

903
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:42,367
Guys it's important
that no matter

904
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:44,002
what happens we stay together.

905
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:46,371
If something unexpected
happens we remain calm.

906
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:48,239
Okay, we stay as a group.

907
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,074
And I'll see if we
can find something

908
00:46:49,074 --> 00:46:51,309
we can use as weapons.

909
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,143
Okay?

910
00:47:12,964 --> 00:47:15,133
(Buzzing)

911
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:19,237
Look.

912
00:47:19,237 --> 00:47:21,940
It's up to us to take
care of the girls.

913
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:24,442
I gotta know that you're okay.

914
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:26,377
- I'm fine.

915
00:47:27,412 --> 00:47:28,546
- You sure?

916
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:30,715
- I said I'm fine alright?

917
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:32,850
- Alright.

918
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:50,635
(Ominous music)

919
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:02,780
Stay close.

920
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:14,092
Okay let's take a left here.

921
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:17,228
That should take us
out to the graveyard.

922
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:20,765
(Dramatic music)

923
00:48:20,765 --> 00:48:21,699
What is it?

924
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:24,635
- I saw something.

925
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:25,703
- Let me see.

926
00:48:31,442 --> 00:48:34,579
Look at me, there's
nothing there.

927
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:35,780
Let's go.

928
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,016
We gotta keep moving.

929
00:48:38,016 --> 00:48:39,684
Take the flashlight.

930
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:45,923
(Dramatic music)

931
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,378
Okay.

932
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:10,848
So there's a long passage
way just across there.

933
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:13,684
- Everybody stay
together alright?

934
00:49:14,552 --> 00:49:16,521
Come on let's go.

935
00:49:16,521 --> 00:49:17,355
Let's go.

936
00:49:32,003 --> 00:49:34,239
(Creaking)

937
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:52,257
(upbeat music)

938
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,504
- Is that real blood?

939
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:07,772
- I don't know.

940
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:10,608
Let's keep moving guys.

941
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:28,126
(Ominous music)

942
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:36,701
(Sam screams)

943
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,903
- Get it off of me!

944
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:40,971
- You move and I shoot!

945
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:43,141
(Moaning)

946
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:50,748
(creaking)

947
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,884
- [Hailey] Who is he?

948
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:58,889
- Help, help me.

949
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,192
Help.

950
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:02,893
Help me.

951
00:51:06,431 --> 00:51:08,032
- What's he saying?

952
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,903
- I think he's saying help me.

953
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:19,310
(Creaking)

954
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:23,281
(ominous music)

955
00:51:34,459 --> 00:51:35,293
- Help me.

956
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:39,264
Help.

957
00:51:39,264 --> 00:51:40,331
- Sam, don't.

958
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:43,768
- I'm Samantha.

959
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:56,981
Are you Hamadi?

960
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:00,518
Listen to me.

961
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,956
We don't wanna hurt you.

962
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:09,627
(Upbeat music)

963
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:25,843
- Stone.

964
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:27,678
- I think he's saying
something about a stone.

965
00:52:27,678 --> 00:52:28,513
- Death.

966
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,482
Statue of death.

967
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,252
(Dramatic music)

968
00:52:36,254 --> 00:52:38,723
- Sam what is he saying?

969
00:52:38,723 --> 00:52:40,725
- [Hamadi] Sheru statue.

970
00:52:41,959 --> 00:52:43,361
- The guys on
drugs or something.

971
00:52:43,361 --> 00:52:44,495
- Hey!

972
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:45,496
This isn't helping any,

973
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,665
he's obviously lost it!

974
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:49,166
- Hamadi what is sheru?

975
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,235
- [Hamadi] Statue.

976
00:52:50,235 --> 00:52:51,068
- What?

977
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,406
- The statue can
reincarnate your fears.

978
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:00,578
- [Sam] Where can
we find the statue?

979
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:05,983
- That's not the security guard.

980
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:07,985
Who are we dealing with?

981
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,490
- I think it has something
to do with that statue.

982
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:13,324
- What are you talking about?

983
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:14,825
What statue?

984
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:16,894
- That statue you pulled out
of the crate in the work room.

985
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:18,729
- What are you saying?

986
00:53:20,164 --> 00:53:22,300
- He's saying that the
statue of the Sheru

987
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,235
is reincarnating our fears.

988
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:25,370
- [Carter] Think about
what you're saying.

989
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,737
- Forget about the damn statue!

990
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:29,139
We gotta get the
hell out of here!

991
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:30,908
- Wait, what was Candice's fear?

992
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:32,443
- Look, I don't know.

993
00:53:32,443 --> 00:53:33,844
- Being suffocated.

994
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:35,946
- Yeah, that's what she said.

995
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,181
- So?!

996
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:39,917
- So she suffocated
to death in sand.

997
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:44,021
What was Zane's fear?

998
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:48,759
- [Carter] I don't know,
he was stabbed to death.

999
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:52,797
- Okay, well what did he
tell us all the fears were?

1000
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:53,631
- Ghosts.

1001
00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:56,767
- Spiders.

1002
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:02,072
- [Sam] Losing your mind.

1003
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,508
- Okay what else?

1004
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:06,744
- I don't know, the dark?

1005
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:08,846
- Clowns.

1006
00:54:12,983 --> 00:54:16,987
- This statue, this Sheru,
whatever it's called.

1007
00:54:19,357 --> 00:54:22,092
I think it's bringing
our fears to life.

1008
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,595
- No, no, that's not possible.

1009
00:54:26,431 --> 00:54:28,733
- Devon what are you afraid of?

1010
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:32,102
- I'm not afraid of
anything alright.

1011
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,104
- Sam, what's your fear?

1012
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:37,975
You gotta tell me
what your fear is.

1013
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:40,645
(Ominous music)

1014
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:43,414
What?

1015
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,219
(Loud thuds)

1016
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:55,225
- Your fear will kill you.

1017
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:57,962
(Loud thuds)

1018
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:00,197
- We gotta get out of here.

1019
00:55:03,568 --> 00:55:06,236
(Loud gunshots)

1020
00:55:17,748 --> 00:55:18,916
- We gotta get the
hell out of here!

1021
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:19,984
Come on!

1022
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:21,786
- Sam, we gotta go now.

1023
00:55:21,786 --> 00:55:22,853
- Okay, come on Hamadi.

1024
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:24,622
Come on, we gotta go.

1025
00:55:26,123 --> 00:55:28,459
(Loud thud)

1026
00:55:30,528 --> 00:55:32,397
(ominous music)

1027
00:55:32,397 --> 00:55:34,832
Please, you have to stand up.

1028
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:51,849
- [Carter] Sam, come on!

1029
00:55:54,552 --> 00:55:57,388
(Faint growling)

1030
00:55:57,388 --> 00:56:00,157
(Hamadi screams)

1031
00:56:06,597 --> 00:56:09,233
(Hailey screams)

1032
00:56:09,233 --> 00:56:10,067
- Hailey wait!
(Menacing music)

1033
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:10,901
- Hailey!

1034
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:16,774
(Hailey screams)

1035
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:19,309
Hailey!

1036
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,411
Hailey stop!

1037
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:21,245
- Wait!

1038
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:26,951
- Hailey slow down!

1039
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,592
Hailey, calm down!

1040
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:36,026
Okay, look at me.

1041
00:56:36,026 --> 00:56:37,462
Calm down okay.

1042
00:56:37,462 --> 00:56:38,963
We gotta stay together.

1043
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:40,731
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

1044
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:41,966
Shh, it's okay.

1045
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,302
What did you see?

1046
00:56:46,504 --> 00:56:47,672
Sam?

1047
00:56:47,672 --> 00:56:50,274
You saw something, what was it?

1048
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:51,942
Sam?

1049
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:55,412
- When I was a kid
growing up in Wisconsin

1050
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,147
my family had a farm.

1051
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:00,384
One night my dad
was lat for dinner

1052
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:02,419
so my mom sent me out into
the field to find him.

1053
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,689
(Giggling)

1054
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:14,599
When I found him he
was just lying there.

1055
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:16,366
And I thought he was
playing a trick on me

1056
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:19,303
so I tried to wake him up.

1057
00:57:19,303 --> 00:57:22,039
But he wouldn't wake up.

1058
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:25,810
And when I realized he
was dead I just froze.

1059
00:57:26,911 --> 00:57:28,746
I just froze, I couldn't yell.

1060
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:30,080
I couldn't move.

1061
00:57:31,616 --> 00:57:34,084
And hanging there above his body

1062
00:57:34,084 --> 00:57:35,419
was a scarecrow.

1063
00:57:42,593 --> 00:57:43,928
This tattered old scarecrow

1064
00:57:43,928 --> 00:57:46,864
and it was like it was
just laughing at me.

1065
00:57:46,864 --> 00:57:47,965
Just mocking.

1066
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,769
- Was it a scarecrow?

1067
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:54,438
Was that was you saw back there?

1068
00:57:59,043 --> 00:58:00,110
- What are we gonna do?

1069
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:01,445
- Okay shh.

1070
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:02,713
- We're never gonna
get out of here.

1071
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:04,815
- Hey, don't say that.

1072
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:06,350
We are gonna get out of here.

1073
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:07,718
We're all gonna get outta here.

1074
00:58:07,718 --> 00:58:10,254
We just need to
stick to the plan.

1075
00:58:10,254 --> 00:58:12,923
(Devon screams)

1076
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:30,507
- Carter!

1077
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,076
(Loud thuds)

1078
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:33,578
- Look out Carter!

1079
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,389
(Ominous music)

1080
00:58:51,562 --> 00:58:53,631
(static)

1081
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,635
Is he coming?!

1082
00:58:57,635 --> 00:59:00,605
- [Carter] I don't see
him, I don't see him.

1083
00:59:00,605 --> 00:59:02,339
Hey is everybody okay?

1084
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:04,408
Everyone's alright?

1085
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:05,743
- Oh Devon you're bleeding.

1086
00:59:05,743 --> 00:59:06,677
- [Carter] He got ya?

1087
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:08,746
- Don't touch me I'm fine.

1088
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,816
Now who's fear was that?

1089
00:59:11,816 --> 00:59:13,450
- [Hailey] We're all gonna die.

1090
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:14,752
- Hey Hailey don't
say that okay,

1091
00:59:14,752 --> 00:59:16,186
we're gonna make it out of here.

1092
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:17,688
- We're gonna stay calm okay?

1093
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:19,356
We'll be okay if
we stick together.

1094
00:59:19,356 --> 00:59:22,259
- Shh.
(Faint beeping)

1095
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:23,828
You guys hear that?

1096
00:59:23,828 --> 00:59:24,662
- What?

1097
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:27,632
Sam what do you hear?

1098
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:31,335
- You don't hear that?

1099
00:59:31,335 --> 00:59:32,202
- [Hailey] I hear it.

1100
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:33,871
- Yeah.

1101
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:34,972
What is that?

1102
00:59:34,972 --> 00:59:36,373

- Maybe we should just go
back to the main entrance.

1147
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,880
Maybe someone will come.

1148
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:23,914
