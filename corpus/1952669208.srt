1
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,230
Come on, Eleni.

2
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,274
- Come, Niki.
- Eleni... How's Eleni?

3
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:23,991
Eleni?

4
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,399
Eleni?

5
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,071
Eleni?

6
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,036
Ah, Eleni...

7
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,271
It's me!

8
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,710
My sister!

9
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,470
My little girl.

10
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,468
What did this man
do to you?

11
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,190
Hey children!

12
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,640
Come on, let's go to the tree.

13
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,435
Here?

14
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,834
Up here? On this
branch here?

15
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,477
Pretty.

16
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,036
Isn't it pretty?

17
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,312
Allah opened the skies today.

18
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,676
Yes he did.

19
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,158
-Have you got anything for me?
- Yes.

20
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,719
- Key.
- Thanks.

21
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,791
Two messages.

22
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,908
And... a package.

23
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,431
- All for you, mr. Harris.

24
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,357
A present?

25
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,076
I hope so, Gilmes.
Thank you.

26
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,313
Dear Norman, your photographs of the
war between the Greeks and the Turks

27
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,755
in Asia Minor are interesting

28
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,110
although too artistic for a
daily newspaper.

29
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,918
Unfortunately, we have already
hired another one of your colleagues.

30
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,598
How could he slip out
of our hands!

31
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,873
To lose such a tailor!

32
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,950
Chicago!

33
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,788
I couldn't stand it, Uncle.

34
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,430
God gave our family daughters.

35
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:26,919
Like locusts.

36
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,913
No grooms, no portions!

37
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,239
If it wasn't for the war...

38
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,594
- My dearies will remain single.
- Seven.

39
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,837
Seven marriage cousins.

40
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,796
So let's send to that Prothromos
another one.

41
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,798
This time, from my family.

42
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,756
My Alexandra is ready to travel
to the world's end..

43
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,394
Alexandra, say so yourself.

44
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,794
And she's 27...

45
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,515
- 29.
- Shh!

46
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,950
Brother...

47
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,870
...I have four unmarried girls and
I'm a widow.

48
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,559
I want another chance.

49
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,993
Nikis' godmother knows I
need another chance.

50
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:20,911
Niki.

51
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,156
Your turn.

52
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,556
<i>Prothromos is a very
honest man.</i>

53
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,915
Prothromos is very honest.

54
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,956
Now you know good English,
I'll teach you some more.

55
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,959
Then why did you call us? You had
already decided.

56
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,516
It's unfair.

57
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,235
And God watches!

58
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,711
Haro!

59
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,557
Haro!

60
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,309
Haro!

61
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,997
My daughter. Haro?

62
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,396
Haro!

63
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,717
Antonis...

64
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,317
Antonis.

65
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,195
My long-haired Haro.

66
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,270
The Doctor said that on Monday
we'll break the plaster.

67
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,036
I'm positive.

68
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,237
I want to return to Samothrace strong.

69
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,591
Haro...

70
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,033
...you haven't told me
the colour of your eyes yet.

71
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,549
Brown maybe?

72
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,235
What would I do all these months
without your letters?

73
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,515
I kiss you.

74
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,999
Soldier Antonis Memas.

75
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,958
God's servant Hareklia (Haro)
takes

76
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,040
...God's servant Constantinos.

77
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,237
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

78
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,477
Amen.

79
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,112
Have a nice trip to America.

80
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,150
Forgive me.

81
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,596
I wanted to admire you
as a bride.

82
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,476
Grandpa...

83
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,508
Natalia Petrova.

84
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,879
Daria lvanova.

85
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,796
Maria Nuamova

86
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,157
Did you go to the doctor
I told you about?

87
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,949
Olga, my little.

88
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,238
With this you have paid
for your ticket.

89
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
OK. We'd like to look at the
young man.

90
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,237
OK. Sit down, sit down.

91
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,435
OK. Genadi Louisin.

92
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,471
30 years old. Railroad worker at the
west coast of America.

93
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,949
Look at those eyes.

94
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,152
Handsome son of a bitch.

95
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,628
We wrote to each other

96
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,073
on the 2nd of May, 1922, which is
of course today, in other words

97
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,713
at 10 o'clock precisely, which is

98
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,834
...midnight American time...

99
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,395
...a priest will place a ring on
the finger of the lucky fiancé.

100
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,638
OK please, please, everybody, please,
let's have quiet.

101
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,229
Thank you very much.

102
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,679
Step over here.

103
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,432
Yeah.

104
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,031
I announce the engagement of
the servant of God, Olga

105
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,630
to the servant of God, Genadi.

106
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,311
Please.

107
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,632
So, you're now engaged.

108
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,709
Feel good?

109
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,471
When I arrived, there was
a blizzard.

110
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,031
That's right.

111
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,159
The snow was 1 metre high.

112
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,279
I cried for 15 days.

113
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,639
I couldn't handle Chicago.

114
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,549
And you think I will?

115
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,790
I swear to Dad's bones, Niki.

116
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,759
Prothromos is a soft man.

117
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,715
It's the second woman he takes
from the same house.

118
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,149
He agreed immediately.

119
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,149
Even I found it strange.

120
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,868
Do you love here, on
the island?

121
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,068
Did I ever sew a new dress
to go on a date?

122
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,119
Did I ever put jasmine
on my chest?

123
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,153
Did I ever expect the postman?

124
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,957
Love...

125
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,838
Love is for the loiterers, Eleni.

126
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,390
But I miss it.

127
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,194
If it was a stranger...

128
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,037
Someone who would wait for me.

129
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,475
I migrate in order to get married with
the same wedding dress...

130
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,952
Holding the same picture as
you did last year.

131
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,311
Are you sure?

132
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,199
If you've got the cash, yes.

133
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,597
Sold to Boston World, then.

134
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,195
From Smyrna Gazette to the Boston
World.

135
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,393
And you just take my
first pay check.

136
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,595
Get out of here.

137
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,990
Good luck, kid.

138
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,753
And watch your ass in battle.

139
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,319
Have a good trip, big guy.

140
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,236
It's been a while since you read my
palm, Emine. What does it say now?

141
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,318
A wave will erase all your
past life.

142
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,557
It already has.

143
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,313
I'm going to start over again.

144
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,157
How?

145
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,797
Who knows?

146
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,799
Selling automobiles, maybe.

147
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,436
Or shoes.

148
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,355
And no more pictures?

149
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,191
I'm going home.

150
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,393
At least maybe I can
save my marriage.

151
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,277
Hey!

152
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,796
Hey! The glasses!

153
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,071
- Who did you ask?
- I'll pay you.

154
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,834
- You got them from the table..
- We didn't steal them, we'll pay..

155
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,709
Look at a man...

156
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,756
Calm down, forget him.

157
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,038
We'll find elsewhere.

158
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,391
Who are all these women?

159
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,111
They are the mail order brides.

160
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,269
Wares, rape, orphan hood
earthquakes, poverty,...

161
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,793
...that's what's driving
these women away..

162
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,753
- To where?
-  To America.

163
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,556
Which is full of unmarried
immigrants.

164
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:22,956
Dear God...

165
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,995
don't let the sea get angry.

166
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,516
Make America beautiful.

167
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,112
Make it look like Russia.

168
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,319
Are you from Samothrace?

169
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,233
Anyone from Samothrace?

170
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,671
No, Russian.

171
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,549
Anyone from Samothrace?
- I don't know.

172
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,710
Any girl from Samothrace?

173
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,028
Yianenna here.

174
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,560
My sugarplum, "zaharenio mou".

175
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,551
Anyone from Samothrace?

176
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,796
Over here!

177
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:43,911
Come!

178
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,352
Sit.

179
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,031
Sit with us.

180
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,470
What's that?

181
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,390
My grandpa's oud.

182
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,149
He taught me how to play.

183
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,151
- Are you dressmakers?
- I am.

184
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,196
Kalmia and garlic.

185
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,551
The broom asked for
his favourite food.

186
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,719
He says that the American
garlic doesn't smell.

187
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,110
Prothomos.

188
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,629
Chicago'da terzi dükkaný var.

189
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,718
He'll sew clothes for men
and I for women.

190
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,954
He asked for any woman, as long
as she doesn't nag.

191
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,836
What could I do?

192
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,469
Four women count on me.

193
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,152
And four men count on me.

194
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,070
I'm Niki.

195
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,632
All these six are from
the island.

196
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,191
Angeliki, Lemonia...

197
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,157
- Katerina.
- Margarita.

198
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,039
- Antigone.
- Maria.

199
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,472
Samothrace is out to
conquer Chicago!

200
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,072
I'm Haro. I'm from Thrace.

201
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,279
In Thrace I made sweets. But
the earthquake toppled the shop.

202
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,039
I'm going to Canada to marry
a pastry-cook.

203
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,874
Ohh! Is he from Samothrace?

204
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,391
Is the pastry-cook
from Samothrace?

205
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,189
No, no.
Not him.

206
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,036
Making friends is wonderful.
Making money's fine.

207
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,311
Hey girls!

208
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,756
- Let's have a dance.

209
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:36,957
A dance?

210
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,232
Cheers!

211
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,594
It's a nice party, eh?

212
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,475
You know each other.
Maria.

213
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,797
Mister Harris...

214
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,276
...our friend Emine told me that
you are an excellent war photographer.

215
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,913
I'd like to ask you a favour.

216
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,509
Take my portrait..

217
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,919
For the newspaper of my island.

218
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,876
Mykonos.

219
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,392
Fat Yiorgos, the ship's photographer,
did not do a good job.

220
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,389
Both times I came out with
my eyes closed.

221
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,550
I'm sorry, but my photography
days are over.

222
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,432
So...A war is the only
thing that

223
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,158
inspires you?

224
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,437
Exclusively manly things?

225
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,952
A war doesn't inspire me.

226
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,956
What...

227
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,469
What about these?

228
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,389
Sweet, huh?

229
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,790
- I was never so lucky mister...
- Karabulat.

230
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,394
Ka- ra- bu- lat.

231
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,433
From the beautiful land of Georgia.

232
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,397
You should photograph it some time.

233
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,359
I run immigration agency. I have
seventy passengers on board.

234
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,192
Congratulations. I thought you
imported spicy photographs.

235
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,231
What's wrong with spicy
photographs?

236
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,158
Those eastern women...

237
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,072
...ethereal bodies...

238
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,834
...they make you sigh.

239
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,477
Yeah.

240
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,552
This is not pornography.

241
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,952
- It is art.
- Well, sure. Fine. I understand..

242
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,158
Well, if you wish to see them
I'm in the cabin 57.

243
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,436
- OK, thank you. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too. Thank you.

244
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,837
Good evening.
(Kalispera)

245
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,236
Good evening.

246
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,950
Where are the other girls?
(Pou einai...)

247
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,277
They left.

248
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,836
- Your English is good..
- Thank you.

249
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,235
My godmother taught me English
and sewing.

250
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,150
I'm a seamstress.

251
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:17,797
What's your name?

252
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,029
Mine is Norman.

253
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,676
My name's Niki...

254
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,191
Douka.

255
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,072
Well then mine's Norman Harris.

256
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,712
What papers were you...tearing?

257
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,149
You were tearing photographs!

258
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,069
I was a photographer.

259
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,355
You are not anymore?

260
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,753
Right now I'm nothing
but a passenger.

261
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:57,957
Like me.

262
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,432
Or less.

263
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,559
I'm neither a seamstress
nor a bride.

264
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,710
If... you have more photographs

265
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,429
...don't tear them.

266
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,556
Just give them to me.

267
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,150
What will you do with them?

268
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,830
Even photographs of strangers are...

269
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,517
very good for decoration.

270
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,389
Your house must have a lot
of photographs.

271
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,271
Only one.

272
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,239
- Your parents' wedding?
- No.

273
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,199
My father in his coffin.

274
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,788
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

275
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,676
My father in his coffin and...

276
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,399
...all the family around him.

277
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,991
This is the way in my island.

278
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,317
Many people have their...

279
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,950
...only photograph when they're dead.

280
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,355
So what photograph did you
send to America?

281
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,031
I did not.

282
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,397
The girls from my island

283
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,793
we sent birth papers so the
husbands know our age.

284
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,311
Here.

285
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,199
Haro's veil.

286
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,596
So you mend wedding gowns as well.

287
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,399
700 down there.

288
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,433
Most of them are second, third hand.

289
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,431
Good night.

290
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,551
Where are you from?

291
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,472
I'm from a place I will
never see again.

292
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,672
And one, and two! Let's go!

293
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,031
Evelyn, bacaklarýný serbest býrak!

294
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,911
Oh Carol, you put on some
weight, darling! Take a break!

295
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,394
Oh, captain!

296
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,235
The "9 Muses" is their big hit.

297
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,030
They may be a bit rusty after the tour
of the antiquities but

298
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,913
three or four more rehearsals
and they'll fly again.

299
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,468
Sure Marion, sure.

300
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,518
Once they've seen the Acropolis,
Troy...

301
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,874
...and the Delphi up close they'll soar.

302
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,871
These women are bored
with their marriages.

303
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,597
They wouldn't know how to
put a roast in the oven.

304
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,193
By the way Marion, there is a sewing machine
and a tailor in first class

305
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,957
- Who can replace your stolen costumes.
- Oh! Does he embroider?

306
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,315
That's asking for a lot.

307
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,638
There is a seamstress
in third class.

308
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:28,951
Niki Douka.

309
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,789
Great. Nikola!

310
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,034
Go find Niki Douka.

311
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,795
Tell her that there's a good job
for her in first class.

312
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,878
Excuse me, gentlemen.

313
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,559
Come on girls! Lt's stick
those chests out.

314
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,829
The moustache doesn't suit him.

315
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,838
Tell me more about Antonis.

316
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,798
Well... He joined the army.

317
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,229
About 5 years ago.

318
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,790
I remember his hair...

319
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,479
Black.

320
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,233
Is it only his hair
that you remember?

321
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,398
His house was far away.
2 hours by foot.

322
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,992
Near St. Elias church.

323
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,629
2 hours by foot.

324
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,316
How did it look like?

325
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,389
Blue windows.

326
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,391
Small.

327
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,156
Just that?

328
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,550
A jasmine...

329
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,155
...big like a forest.

330
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,313
Come on, remember more.

331
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:37,955
He chanted at the church.

332
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,110
The vicar choral said he would
send him to study Byzantine music.

333
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,149
Is that so?

334
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,996
Imagine...

335
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,953
If it's written on 27th
January 1922,

336
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,199
it's the sixth letter.

337
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,195
We'd better keep them in order.

338
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,596
27th of January, 1922.

339
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,913
Dear Haro, our life will change
in Samothrace.

340
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,388
You will really like it there.

341
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:26,236
The Aegean Sea shines in blue
from our vineyard.

342
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,517
Once again, you don't mention
the colour of your eyes.

343
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,315
You always forget to.

344
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,833
I kiss you,

345
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,794
Antonis Memas.

346
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,389
Beautifully written.

347
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,392
Who'd expect it from Antonis?

348
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,434
A real love letter.

349
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,194
I'm going to be like a sculpture
at the ruins of Ephesus.

350
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,831
I'm sorry darling, we have
a rehearsal.

351
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,310
OK! Let's begin!

352
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,188
Well done, ladies!

353
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,957
Make the tunics as short
as possible.

354
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,998
No one's interested in their art.

355
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,639
Come outside, hurry up!

356
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,436
I'll see you this evening.

357
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,875
You're very good at your work.

358
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,877
Every person has a gift.

359
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,475
What kind of photographs
did you make?

360
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,955
Unusual ones.

361
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,836
Who paid?

362
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:49,637
Nobody.

363
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,757
Then why?

364
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,711
I like to take photographs of
things that others pass over.

365
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,630
Details.

366
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,875
The minor things.

367
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,835
Minor things.

368
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,353
- Did you photograph Americans?
- I sold to Americans..

369
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,438
It was still the fashion then to
mail postcards of landscapes.

370
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:26,877
Do you understand?

371
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:29,717
A little.

372
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,552
Can you still make
a photograph?

373
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,955
Who'd be interested?

374
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,513
The brides from my island.

375
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,197
Not you?
(Esy ohi?)

376
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,997
Ohi.
(No.)

377
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,437
I don't have my camera anymore,
anyway.

378
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,714
What, you lost it?

379
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,111
I sold it.

380
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,154
By the time you go to Canada,
it won't be visible.

381
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,478
When I declined to migrate

382
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,832
...my father beat me up.

383
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,436
I packed and tried to
go to The City (Istanbul).

384
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,790
My little brother gave me his pocket
money to buy Antonis cherries and cigars.

385
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,477
But my father found out.

386
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,517
He chased me in the corn fields...

387
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,998
And caught me.

388
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,390
He beat me up.

389
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,349
Even though he loves me very much.

390
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,631
Then why?

391
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,548
He was desperate.

392
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,515
If I don't get the boys to America,
they'll be drafted in the army.

393
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,998
12 and 16 years old.

394
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,396
I brought them up.

395
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,428
And suddenly, Canada.

396
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,033
What do we know about them, Niki?

397
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,071
Only their job and address.

398
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,909
How are we going to
sleep with a stranger?

399
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,028
Only rice, Heracles.

400
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,552
I can't stand anything else.

401
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,438
Heracles takes care of me.

402
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,392
This is the only place where I
enjoy a bite to eat.

403
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,637
Captain...

404
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,479
If your proposition still holds
and you can lend me a camera...

405
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,073
...I'll take your portrait after dinner.

406
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,197
What changed your mind?

407
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,678
A face like yours is
hard to resist.

408
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,716
<i>Is that so?</i>
And who will you take after, then?

409
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,676
Handsome Heracles or
skinny Yiorgos?

410
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,635
Actually, I was thinking of taking
the portraits of the ladies in third class.

411
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,759
With their wedding veils on as well.

412
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,878
But there are 700 of them.

413
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,794
700 pairs of eyes!

414
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:07,717
Mister Harris...

415
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,151
Five of my first cousins

416
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,350
and four of my nieces
were mail-order brides.

417
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,029
You'd better show those women...
respect.

418
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,756
It's like snow in the summer.

419
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,876
Good morning.
(in Turkish)

420
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,116
Good morning...
in English.

421
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,071
My name is Norman Harris and...

422
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,679
...I just want to thank you for
allowing me this favour of

423
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,879
taking your photographs.

424
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,716
It's incredible...the way you
all look it's...

425
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,114
very beautiful.

426
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,636
You're all dressed but it's
gonna take sometime.

427
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,119
Nicolas is my assistant
over there

428
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,312
and he'll help me photograph your
beautiful head dresses.

429
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,800
It's great, I love these flowers
as well. It's great.

430
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,349
I know some of you are from
different countries

431
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,076
and I'll try and take
the photograph with...

432
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,270
Good luck ,sir.

433
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,472
Thank you.
I need your good wishes.

434
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,234
If Nicolas gets bored of me I
might need your English as well.

435
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,870
You're wearing black?

436
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,469
I don't need a photograph.

437
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,717
Niki...

438
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,718
please stay for the
first photograph.

439
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:05,751
For luck.

440
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,553
Nicolas! Let's do this.

441
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,551
Let's get going.

442
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,475
You'd like to be the first?
Here we go.

443
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,118
Everybody, sit down.

444
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,476
OK, go.

445
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,357
Like this.

446
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,832
- I want you to look down here, the lens.
- Aikaterini. 23 years old.

447
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,636
Aikaterini. Very beautiful name.
There you go.

448
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,390
OK. A beautiful picture.

449
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,269
Smile.

450
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,314
Yeah. Good.

451
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,516
Angeliki. 19 years old.

452
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,069
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

453
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,153
- You like it?
- Very nice.

454
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,238
- I'll see you later.
- OK.

455
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,711
- Hey Yiorgos.
- Oh, hello..

456
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:58,270
May I peak at the blushing brides?

457
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,630
No charge of that.

458
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,953
But I'm willing to
pay, Yiorgos.

459
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,598
For some negatives.

460
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,437
You can tell the American they
were mislaid.

461
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,598
Sorry, but I can't help you.

462
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,394
Sorry, but the American keeps
them in his cabin.

463
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,479
Hey! Excuse me.

464
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,231
Yelena Missin. Russian.
Give me her photograph, please.

465
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,472
I am her best man and guardian, and
her future husband is very correct.

466
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,111
I haven't photographed her bottom,
mr Karabulat. She has nothing to fear.

467
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:48,591
I won't even allow you to photograph her
face or even half her face or even her profile

468
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,473
so please give me the photographs.

469
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,551
- As soon as I develop them.
- You have...

470
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,033
You have developed them.

471
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,909
- But she herself did not refuse.
- She herself has been taught never to say no.

472
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,469
I'll ask her.

473
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,952
It is not for her to say, I mean
that is how the agency works.

474
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,593
Well this is not how I work.

475
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:18,993
Well... Let us not lose any heart over
this. There is somebody on board
who will deal with it for me.

476
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,598
Ten years younger.

477
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,752
Show them to fat Yiorgos.

478
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,269
Tell him to pack.

479
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,710
I will, my Captain.

480
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,035
The Russians, leave them out,
friend Norman.

481
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,233
Has their guardian forbid it?

482
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,155
I forbid it.

483
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,229
Can you tell me why?

484
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:58,277
Money.

485
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,116
What money?

486
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,959
Mr. Karabulat is very particular.

487
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,677
But he is a regular customer of the
Argonautical steaming company

488
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:08,673
Eleven years now without fail.

489
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,912
The remaining women are enough.

490
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,678
And more than enough at that.

491
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,989
What do you put inside?

492
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:24,637
Good morning.

493
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,391
Good morning.

494
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,790
I bought this one when I
was planning a trip to Greece.

495
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,359
It's an English Greek phrase book.

496
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,630
Read it the other way around.
I'd like you to have it.

497
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,718
The sun's making
your eyes shine.

498
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,791
What did he say?

499
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,230
He said that he's hungry.

500
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,190
It's about time.

501
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,392
Antigone, come on.

502
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,879
You speak English well.

503
00:45:59,080 --> 00:45:59,956
Haro, wait for me.

504
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:04,911
Thank you.

505
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,516
From my island.

506
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:14,996
Black olives.

507
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,070
Samothrace?

508
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:19,757
(In Greek)
<i>Samothraki.</i>

509
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,555
What is your village?

510
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:24,992
Detroit.

511
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,073
But my father was born in Ireland.

512
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,793
So you're not American-American.

513
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,791
Your mother was mail-order
bride too?

514
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:35,392
No.

515
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,112
No.

516
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,997
My father, he saw her scaling halibut.

517
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,076
It's a fish. She was scaling a fish one day
in the market place...

518
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,238
And he saw her and he fell in love
with her curly red hair.

519
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,315
I became a photographer because I
couldn't stand the smell of fish.

520
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,155
I wish I could show you some of
the places I've been.

521
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,235
Minor things.

522
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,072
I think I know that song.

523
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,270
Up to the age of 16 I sang
and danced a lot.

524
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,429
After that... finished.

525
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,238
You know... I've seen more
than 50.000 palms in my life.

526
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,589
Adulterous' hands are dry.
Ministers' are cold.

527
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,792
The hands of diplomats are like...
Like linen.

528
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,149
Let me see your palm!

529
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,913
I want to read your future.

530
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,875
<i>Kýsmetini.</i>

531
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,197
For free.

532
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:45,950
No need.

533
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,356
I know mine.

534
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:39,037
So, what are you going to do my friend,
about Yelena, the Russian woman?

535
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,312
I'm not in the mood right now.

536
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,632
Send her as a gift to the
Turkish Engineer.

537
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:51,075
Oh, don't go celibate now my friend,
Captain Marinos.

538
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:57,155
Thank God, I have found first
class quality again.

539
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:07,234
You know, in 1917 I had the
bunch of 11 women with big tits.

540
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:12,235
In 1919 they all had blue eyes
and little beauty spots.

541
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,634
1920, voluptuous asses.

542
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,589
Now I have... virgins.

543
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,636
With guarantee.

544
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,030
Olga Kratingova. 16 years old.

545
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,752
Resident of Taganrok. Found to be
anatomically a virgin.

546
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,515
April 1922.

547
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:44,635
A little... cunt of gold.

548
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:29,748
I've seventy women, they will pick up
a shovel and take the whole of Oklahoma.

549
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:37,475
But I have six who are destined
for special employment.

550
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,315
Anyway, go easy on
the photographer.

551
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,554
Don't provoke him.

552
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,873
Here Nicolas, take these.

553
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:45,918
- Take them to the lab.
- Niki.

554
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,352
Dont forget to do the
Captain's jacket.

555
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,669
There's no film in the camera.

556
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,919
I just wanna see your face.

557
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,270
I'm going to rip off all my buttons just so
I can watch you sew them
back again with your hands.

558
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,155
Then you'll pay double.

559
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,955
Niki Douka. Tell me
something about yourself.

560
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,710
There is nothing special,
mr. Norman Harris.

561
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,109
Dont you have dreams?

562
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,472
Yes.

563
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,508
A Singer machine.

564
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,470
Nothing else?

565
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,595
- Fabric.
- And?

566
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,353
And...
A lot of customers.

567
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,037
Is that all?

568
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,710
Yes, that is all.

569
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,798
I don't believe a word.

570
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,632
They all say: "Niki do this, Niki do
that, Niki come, Niki go".

571
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,992
- "Niki, you are the father of the family".
- Are you?

572
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:00,951
Yes, I am.

573
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,476
People like you make us
appreciate life.

574
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:05,478
No.

575
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,557
Not me.

576
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,192
My father.

577
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,197
Like father, like daughter.

578
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,992
My father was a very
funny man.

579
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,993
Mine, he was very vivid.

580
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,755
Like a hurricane.

581
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,478
Like father, like son.

582
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:32,670
You made a joke.

583
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:36,156
Page 27. English proverb.
Not a joke.

584
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,233
In Greece, mostly men
make jokes.

585
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,710
You are onboard now.
You're not in Greece.

586
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,358
So you can say any
joke you want.

587
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,629
Yelena from Odessa.

588
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,594
Why you put me
here in the dark?

589
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,116
You'll see.

590
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,870
I see nothing.

591
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,276
<i>Siga-siga.</i>
Don't be in a hurry.

592
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,555
I am in a hurry.

593
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,510
They're gonna look for me.

594
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,549
Just give me a minute.

595
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,550
I don't have a minute.

596
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,310
I want to go.

597
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:47,392
Look.

598
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,193
See its magic?

599
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:12,551
In America, the rich paint their servants
black to distinguish them.

600
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,710
- Will they paint us as well?
- Don't be stupid!

601
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:18,994
We'll be ladies with ring, hat and
a purse of our own.

602
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,788
- Our own purse?
- Sure.

603
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:29,229
Miss Kardaki...

604
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,069
...I wanted to ask you.

605
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,239
Do you believe that we marry
the appropriate ones?

606
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,998
There aren't appropriate or not.
The workers don't think about things like that.

607
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,998
My father used to choose
the grooms.

608
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,550
He was too choosy.

609
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,677
So the time passed.

610
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,712
Now I give in marriage others.

611
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,359
This is my tenth transatlantic voyage.

612
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,315
Always for the same sacred reason.

613
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,513
I have experience.

614
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,511
Especially for the immigrants,
love is big trouble.

615
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:19,313
Close your eyes...

616
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,350
and dream...

617
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,713
a huge country.

618
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,634
Do you know how many men wear old shirts?
How many need a new one?

619
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,233
Millions!

620
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,753
Well, my girl...

621
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,798
sit tight and get weaving!

622
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:45,838
In 10 years' time your tailor shop
will be huge!

623
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:48,991
In the East...

624
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:54,749
...the men steal the one they love
on a night with no moon

625
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,908
and run far away on a white horse.

626
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:58,912
<i>Beyaz atýn üstünde.</i>

627
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,430
Say that again.

628
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:03,352
I said, in the East...

629
