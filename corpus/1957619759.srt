1
00:00:01,206 --> 00:00:03,956
(dramatic music)

2
00:01:41,278 --> 00:01:42,719
(thudding)

3
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,297
- [Detective] Jesus.

4
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:45,648
God damn machine!

5
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:47,148
I hate this thing.

6
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,680
It never works.

7
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,210
(interposing voices shouting)

8
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,514
- Maybe you just ticked it off.

9
00:01:53,514 --> 00:01:55,780
Bangin' on it like that.

10
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,180
I'd get upset, wouldn't you?

11
00:01:58,575 --> 00:02:00,120
Thank you.

12
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,610
- [Detective] Ah, here we go.

13
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:03,220
Beginning suspect interrogation,

14
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,410
date June 21st, 2028.

15
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,000
Time, 6:23am.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,670
Investigation of multiple homicide.

17
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:12,570
Please state your name and occupation.

18
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,330
- Garland, Dr. Garland Widmark.

19
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,723
Computer programmer.
- Where do you work?

20
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,288
- The Titanic.
- Excuse me?

21
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:26,423
- (laughs) It's just a joke, a bad joke.

22
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,570
- [Detective] Makin' wise cracks, Doc?

23
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,440
You see somethin' funny
about this situation?

24
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,353
- No, no I don't.

25
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,240
- [Detective] We all
sympathize with your ordeal,

26
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,870
Dr. Widmark, but if you just sort of...

27
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,770
- I just never saw anybody die before.

28
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,233
Not one single human being.

29
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,620
I, I feel like I've been in a war.

30
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:54,536
That's what it was,
you know, it was a war.

31
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:55,810
- [Detective] Well, perhaps
if you tell us about it

32
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,710
you'd feel better.

33
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:00,803
- Yeah, right.

34
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:05,513
Um, I just really don't
know where to start, though.

35
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,030
- [Detective] Try at the beginning.

36
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,176
(dramatic music)

37
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:13,440
- [Garland] The first thing
I remember about last night

38
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,080
is Lita and me running for our lives

39
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,749
and a couple heavy hitters
right on our heels.

40
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:19,950
(panting)

41
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,500
We almost escaped when suddenly

42
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,575
a car blocked our way.

43
00:03:23,575 --> 00:03:24,810
(brakes screech)

44
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,860
There was no way out.

45
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,373
The situation seemed hopeless.

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,703
Exactly like it was supposed to.

47
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:39,760
- Well, well, well.

48
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,970
You and your skirt musta
gone simple, gumshoe.

49
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,349
Sneakin' around on Rains
tur-tur-tur-tur-tur-tur-turf.

50
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:50,080
- Yeah, you musta gone simple. (cackles)

51
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,633
- I just said that.

52
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:52,540
- I know.

53
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,123
- Then why did you repeat
repe-repe-repe-repeat it?

54
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,570
- I wanted to make sure
they, they, they got it.

55
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,180
- Don't worry, they got it.

56
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,013
Now,

57
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,229
they're gonna get it.

58
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:08,710
(suspenseful music)

59
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,853
Kiss your boyfriend goodnight, sweetheart.

60
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:14,879
(gangsters laughing)

61
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,162
- It's late.

62
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:18,663
(whacking)

63
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:20,709
- Ah, you're dead, girly girl.

64
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:22,600
(whacking)
(grunting)

65
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,043
- That's Dr. Girly Girl to you.

66
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:28,774
(indistinct shouting)

67
00:04:28,774 --> 00:04:30,941
(buzzing)

68
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,740
What'dya have to go and
do that for, Garland?

69
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,450
Just when a girl's
startin' to have some fun.

70
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,870
- We're on a deadline, Lita.

71
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,090
It's already five to 10:00.

72
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,350
- Would you unwind?

73
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,630
You don't have to be back until midnight.

74
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,527
What's wrong with mixing
business with pleasure?

75
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:48,780
- The pleasure's more like aggravation.

76
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,960
This old program's riddled with glitches.

77
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,680
Didn't that stutter bother you at all?

78
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,463
- No, I thought it was kinda cute.

79
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,570
- Uh-huh, well, enjoy it while you can

80
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,760
because when I put the
new Donald 3000 online,

81
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,490
you're gonna find that these RCUs

82
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,410
will talk like they've
been given voice lessons

83
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,260
from Henry Higgins.

84
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,330
- Mm-hm, assuming the
stutter's a computer error.

85
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,540
- Mechanical glitches are
your department, Dr. Hayworth.

86
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,670
- That's right.

87
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,543
Think about it.

88
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,880
- What, you're not gonna fix it?

89
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,563
- Nope, I like cute things.
- Me too.

90
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,120
- What?

91
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,720
- Nothing.

92
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,300
Lita and I were chief technicians

93
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,633
at the most popular theme park
in history, Gangster World.

94
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,130
I never enjoyed going on test runs much,

95
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,270
but when Lita asked me, well,

96
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,263
what could I say?

97
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,567
I really liked her.

98
00:05:45,283 --> 00:05:47,190
I mean, everyone agreed
the park's creator,

99
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,600
Dr. Greenstreet, was a genius.

100
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,460
Since the first Gangster World opened,

101
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,330
crimes dropped 50%.

102
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,190
- Welcome to Gangster World.

103
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,480
Choose from any of our 50 game areas

104
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,610
like Burnt Out Alley, Speakeasy,

105
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,880
and Red Light District.

106
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,720
Remember, you are safe at all times.

107
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Crime, violence, cruelty,
don't you just love it?

108
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,780
Well, now you can live it.

109
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,160
Here at Gangster World,
you're free to express

110
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,760
your darkest desires.

111
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,730
Your tracker mechanism
cancels play at any time,

112
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,380
so keep your tracker with you always.

113
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,390
So have fun, don't pull any punches,

114
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,370
and kill one for me.

115
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,990
Remember, you are safe at all times.

116
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,950
Our Robotic Carbon Units are--

117
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,090
- So what do you feel like tonight?

118
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,160
Chinese or Italian?
- Enjoy.

119
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,860
- [Garland] So here's how the park worked.

120
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,540
Robotic Carbon Units, RCUs for short,

121
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,410
inhabited the park's 50 game areas

122
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,180
and snapped to life the moment a player

123
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,750
stepped into the action.

124
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,880
Players paid top dollar for the pleasure

125
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,330
of abusing the RCUs.

126
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,560
Rape, mutilation, you name it.

127
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,143
If you could think it, you
could do it at Gangster World.

128
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,930
And if they got too rough,

129
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:58,120
all the players have to
do is hit their trackers

130
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,543
and the RCUs would freeze.

131
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,213
(mysterious music)

132
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:05,940
(keys clacking)
(beeping)

133
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,830
At the heart of it all was
the park's mainframe computer,

134
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,660
the Donald 2000.

135
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,360
The action was monitored
by Dr. Claire Arden

136
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,473
and our lovable chief of
security, Alan Houston.

137
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,793
In plain talk, Houston hated my guts.

138
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,830
That night was a big night.

139
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,230
We were scheduled to go online

140
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,270
with the new breakthrough
fail safe Donald 3000 system.

141
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,890
My job was to initiate the power transfer

142
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,790
and upgrade at the stroke of midnight.

143
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,390
Greenstreet was a little skittish.

144
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,820
I had some big shot
investors in for a demo

145
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,010
of the new system and was worried about

146
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,203
attempted sabotage from our
competitor, Cybertronics.

147
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,730
The place was crawling with security.

148
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,110
Most of these guys were
rough pieces of work

149
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,740
who enjoyed their job
just a little too much.

150
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,720
- What are you gawkin' at, boy?

151
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,990
That's one of the perks.

152
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,960
Go on, cop a feel.

153
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,350
- No, thank you.

154
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,183
- (scoffs) Candy ass.

155
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:04,436
(banging)

156
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:08,266
All right, scumbag, let's go.

157
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:09,393
You too, sweet cakes.

158
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:14,056
Come on.

159
00:08:14,056 --> 00:08:15,667
(whacking)

160
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:17,750
(laughs)

161
00:08:24,059 --> 00:08:26,930
(soft suspenseful music)

162
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,073
Okay, strip 'em.

163
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,070
(keys clacking)

164
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,540
- [Automated Voice] Welcome
to the Donald 2000 main menu.

165
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,730
Please select command.

166
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:44,493
Upgrade, repair, liquidation, assembly.

167
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,720
Liquidation selected.

168
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,710
- [Garland] The liquidation room

169
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:52,590
was where we recycled
faulty or worn out RCUs,

170
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,120
the part of the process I hated.

171
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,631
- [Automated Voice] Please place RCU

172
00:08:55,631 --> 00:08:56,630
on the disassembly unit.

173
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:58,160
- Okay, honey, come on.

174
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,050
- [Garland] I don't know
why it got to me so bad.

175
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,840
After all, RCUs were only 49.9% human

176
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,464
and 50.1% machine, right?

177
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,297
(machine humming)

178
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,080
Still, I didn't have
much of a stomach for it.

179
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:25,139
(machine beeps)

180
00:09:34,264 --> 00:09:37,014

(sizzling)

183
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,447
- You smoke now, bitch.

184
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,820
(coughing)

185
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:22,923
Come on up.

186
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:31,840
You see the look on the kid's face?

187
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,933
Greener than an Irishman on St. Patty.

188
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,560
Top of the mornin' to ya, laddy. (laughs)

189
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,930
- That's real funny, Mason.
- Oh relax, bud.

190
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,780
Wait'll you do this
two, three times a week.

191
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,710
You get used to it fast.

192
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,040
- [Garland] What happened
from this point on

193
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,430
I can only guess, and it's so bizarre

194
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,450
you probably won't believe me.

195
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,940
Basically whenever we need
a new robot for a game,

196
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,270
we simply go down to the liquidation room,

197
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,840
select a recycled skeleton

198
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,070
and program it with a new
personality and characteristics.

199
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:02,083
All this is normally done
under my strict supervision.

206
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,053
went unnoticed by everyone

- Too bad we had to steam that one.

220
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,692
She was a keeper.
- Mm-hm.

00:13:11,928 --> 00:13:13,011
Do somethin'!

00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:19,304

229
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,013

236

(door rattles)

237
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,710
- [Garland] Houston had
controls in full force

238
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,930
as a countermeasure against
sabotage from the outside,

239
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,740
but what these guys were about to discover

240
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,453
was that the saboteur was
already on the inside.

241
00:14:22,453 --> 00:14:24,614
(thwacking)

242
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,740
(grunting)

243
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,580
- Hey.

244
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,965

(guard thuds)

247
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,490
- Of course I had no idea
that this guy was after me.

248
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,240
I mean, why would anybody wanna kill me?

249
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,630
I didn't have an enemy in the world.

250
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,950
Lita actually defines or used to define

251
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,530
my character as rah-rah, which stands

252
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,753
for revoltingly agreeable squared.

253
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,820
I had some time to kill until midnight.

254
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,800
Lita, as always, was in the mood for fun.

255
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,040
And like a good little rah-rah,

256
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,113
I gave in to her.

257
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:12,008
All right.

258
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:16,228
(beeping)

259
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:17,870
Claire, come in.

260
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,550
I need to run a check on the villains.

261
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,340
Can you give me access to the Speakeasy?

262
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,580
- There's already a game
in progress, Garland.

263
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,823
- How many players?
- Um, just two.

264
00:15:25,823 --> 00:15:28,010
- Will you let them know
we'll be joining them?

265
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,020
- Okay, but you're gonna
miss the big party.

266
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,810
- [Garland] That's okay.

267
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,950
- Let the games begin, people.

268
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,850
Your leader has arrived.

269
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,213
Ah, there he is, my boy wonder.

270
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:43,840
How goes the test run, Garland?

271
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,380
- Revoltingly violent, Dr. Greenstreet.

272
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,780
- Ooh, love those words.

273
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,550
- I'll have the Donald 3000 up and running

274
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,410
by the magic hour.

275
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,243
- Claire.

276
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,450
Houston.

277
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,780
A toast to tomorrow.

278
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,910
- To all 80 new Gangster
Worlds around the globe.

279
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,993
- To the single mainframe
uniting them all.

280
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:10,830
Houston, remember 20 years
ago I saw the future,

281
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,420
a franchise of therapeutic theme parks

282
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,430
where people could safely
release their tensions

283
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,293
and rejoin society as model citizens.

284
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:25,230
And now with the new
Donald 3000 at the helm,

285
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,020
we can upgrade security
and performance levels

286
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,110
throughout the park.

287
00:16:30,085 --> 00:16:35,085
(lively music)
(chattering)

288
00:16:35,716 --> 00:16:38,130
- [Garland] The Speakeasy
was our hottest attraction.

289
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,490
The guests loved to mix it up

290
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,990
with the motley grew of
gangsters and their dames.

291
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,890
Lorre was the arch fiend of Gangster World

292
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,000
and his main squeeze was femme fatale

293
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,480
by the name of Astor.

294
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,020
- Lorre, I'm gettin' ants in my pants.

295
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,000
Come on, take me out for a twirl.

296
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,300
- You're detrailing my train of thought.

297
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,090
Go, amuse yourself.

298
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,363
- That's what you always say.

299
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,820
I'm tired of playing along.

300
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,653
- Astor!

301
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,213
Let me be.

302
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:18,280
- [Garland] Lorre's main territorial rival

303
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,320
was a bootlegger named Rains,

304
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,900
a quick-tempered thug
with a passion for poker.

305
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,770
He liked cards.

306
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:27,363
- Cheater, you callin' me a cheater?

307
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:31,750
(laughs) He's callin' me a cheater.

308
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,780
I'm gonna give you five
seconds to apologize.

309
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,626
One,

310
00:17:35,626 --> 00:17:37,407
(knife snaps)

311
00:17:37,407 --> 00:17:39,665
two, three, four, five.

312
00:17:39,665 --> 00:17:42,082
(man grunts)

313
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:47,045
- Perfect audio calibration,
great visual synthesis,

314
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:51,220
and look, Garland, there's
even some fun going on.

315
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,840
- [Garland] Players wore period costumes

316
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,010
to enhance the experience,

317
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,273
but you could always
pick 'em out in a crowd.

318
00:17:59,218 --> 00:18:01,061
- (laughing) Hey.

319
00:18:01,061 --> 00:18:02,210
Hey!

320
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,220
- [Garland] They'd be all
over the pleasure model RCUs

321
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,308
like a bad suit.

322
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:09,891
(lively music)

323
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:27,066
(soft suspenseful music)

324
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:42,630
(door creaks open)

325
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,410
- Hey, let's, uh, smash
some skulls. (laughing)

326
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,243
Yeah?

327
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,943
- Hey.

328
00:18:47,943 --> 00:18:49,710
Give me a swig of that.

329
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,350
That one's yours.
- Uh-huh.

330
00:18:52,258 --> 00:18:55,065
(thwacking)

331
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:57,315
(grunting)

332
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,919
(players laughing)

333
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,169
(crashing)

334
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:13,632
- [Player] Boy, you're
a bleeder, aren't you?

335
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:15,476
This is great!

336
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:17,588
(players laughing)

337
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:21,079
(shouting)
(whacking)

338
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,945
- [Player] How'd that feel?

339
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:24,351
You like that, huh?

340
00:19:24,351 --> 00:19:26,790
(grunting)

341
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,327
(whacking)

342
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:32,130
- What have we got here, huh?
- Who's nature boy?

343
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,280
- Are you Garland Widmark?
- You're next, pal.

344
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,159
(whacking)
(grunting)

345
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:40,909
(player screams)

346
00:19:44,713 --> 00:19:48,066
(dramatic music)

347
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:50,316
(thudding)

348
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:56,259
(lively music)

349
00:20:01,643 --> 00:20:03,643
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

350
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,170
- So you guys work here, huh?

351
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,050
- Why, you got any, uh, comments?

352
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,680
- Well, I think the
chicks need a little more

353
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,130
flexibility in their hips.

354
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,891
I'm afraid I might wear 'em out.

355
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:19,141
(laughing)

356
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,217
(ominous music)

357
00:20:35,453 --> 00:20:36,672
- Cigars?

358
00:20:36,672 --> 00:20:38,052
Cigarettes?

359
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:39,836
Wubba wubba?

360
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:42,666
- [Players] Wubba wubba!

361
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:43,749
- One please.

362
00:20:45,794 --> 00:20:48,001
- Wubba wubba, wubba wubba.

363
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:49,001
Wubba wubba.

364
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,770
(ominous music)

365
00:21:03,376 --> 00:21:05,959
(lively music)

366
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:15,002
(guests chattering)

367
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:30,180
- Hi there, handsome.

368
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,460
I thought I'd already t-t-tangled

369
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,323
with all the hot action in town.

370
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,633
I'm Astor.

371
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,263
What's your momma call you?

372
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:47,960
Ooh, the strong, silent type, huh?

373
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,073
I like that.

374
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,110
So, you wanna buy me a drink

375
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,010
or shall we skip the foreplay?

376
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,870
- Lita.

377
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,703
Lita.

378
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:02,840
Lita had no idea how I felt about her.

379
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,600
She didn't notice rah-rahs like me.

380
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,283
She was a sucker for good
looks and confidence.

381
00:22:13,412 --> 00:22:17,360
- Mm, outstanding anatomical proportions.

382
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,890
You're good.

383
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:23,220
Hey, smokin', how's about we
play a little Jack and Jill?

384
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,170
- He's mine, squirt.

385
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:28,370
Back off, or after I finish
cuttin' you down to size

386
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,830
you're gonna need tweezers
to pick up the pieces.

387
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,630
- Oh, I'm sorry, didn't you see the sign?

388
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,932
No cows on the dance floor.

389
00:22:35,932 --> 00:22:38,182
(whacking)

390
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:46,235
(screaming)

391
00:22:46,235 --> 00:22:49,152
(glass shattering)

392
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,850
(thudding)

393
00:23:01,824 --> 00:23:03,271
(grunting)

394
00:23:03,271 --> 00:23:06,188
(glass shattering)

395
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:17,878
(man thuds)

396
00:23:21,727 --> 00:23:24,394
(ominous music)

397
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,610
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

398
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,000
- Nice threads, bozo.

399
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,333
Fit to be buried in.

400
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:41,177
(man thuds)

401
00:23:41,177 --> 00:23:46,177
(glass shatters)
(buzzing)

402
00:23:46,735 --> 00:23:48,626
(Garland shrieks)

403
00:23:48,626 --> 00:23:51,046
(chair crashing)

404
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:53,379
(thwacking)

405
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:56,971
- Hayworth!

406
00:23:56,971 --> 00:23:58,623
Let's go!
- Garland!

407
00:23:58,623 --> 00:23:59,456
Garland!

408
00:24:01,433 --> 00:24:04,433
Whoa!
- Come on, let's go, let's go.

409
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:09,127
(glass shattering)

410
00:24:09,127 --> 00:24:12,395
- Look out! (screams)

411
00:24:12,395 --> 00:24:14,645
(crashing)

412
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:21,688
(shattering)
(man shrieks)

413
00:24:22,483 --> 00:24:24,259
(crashing)

414
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:26,785
That was awesome! (laughing)

415
00:24:26,785 --> 00:24:27,618
- Awesome?

416
00:24:27,618 --> 00:24:28,530
That guy.

417
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,350
The, the fail safe didn't work.

418
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,626
I mean, this just one...

419
00:24:33,626 --> 00:24:35,046
(coughing)

420
00:24:35,046 --> 00:24:36,270
- Come on, you big you big lug.

421
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,103
He's no fun.

422
00:24:37,103 --> 00:24:38,823
I'm the one that likes the action.

423
00:24:38,823 --> 00:24:40,780
(clanking)

424
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,883
Whoa!

425
00:24:41,883 --> 00:24:43,169
(Lita screams)

426
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:44,827
- Lita!
- Put me down!

427
00:24:44,827 --> 00:24:47,108
Whoa whoa!
- Lita!

428
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:49,358
(thudding)

429
00:24:54,151 --> 00:24:55,317
Ooh, no.

430
00:24:55,317 --> 00:24:56,150
- Freeze!

431
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:58,005
(buzzing)

432
00:24:58,005 --> 00:24:59,380
Freeze!

433
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,561
(dramatic music)

434
00:25:02,561 --> 00:25:04,811
(whacking)

435
00:25:06,459 --> 00:25:07,983
(shrieking)

436
00:25:07,983 --> 00:25:10,162
(thudding)

437
00:25:10,162 --> 00:25:12,703
- Grab the girl.
- Hey, what are you doing?

438
00:25:12,703 --> 00:25:13,536
Let me go.

439
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:14,883
What are you, let go!

440
00:25:16,422 --> 00:25:17,520
(whacking)

441
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,063
- Oh no, Lita!

442
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,390
(man shrieks)

443
00:25:27,624 --> 00:25:29,874
(cracking)

444
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:32,390
Lita!

445
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,577
Lita, where are you?

446
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:42,490
- [Claire] Garland, what's
wrong, what's the matter?

447
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,433
Are you okay?

448
00:25:43,433 --> 00:25:45,493
- Lita, Lita, have you seen Lita?

449
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:46,420
Have you seen her?

450
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,290
- No, the last time I
saw her she was with you.

451
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:51,150
- No, no, no, we, we got
split up in the park.

452
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,310
A big guy, he attacked us.

453
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,230
- What's goin' on?
- She's in there.

454
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,033
She's in there, I gotta find her.

455
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:57,866
I gotta find Lita.

456
00:25:57,866 --> 00:25:59,670
She's in there, I know she's in.

457
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,100
She's in there, she's in there.

458
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,710
- According to the personnel report,

459
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,040
Dr. Hayworth just left the park.

460
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,070
- No, no, no, no, that,
that can't be right.

461
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,770
There was an outsider in the game.

462
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,820
- An outsider?

463
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,890
- Yes, he attacked us.

464
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,500
- Sure, guess that's easier than admitting

465
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,400
that your almighty
computer has gone screwy.

466
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,600
- Computers are not like people, Houston.

467
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,010
They don't make mistakes.

468
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,690
- Now this outsider, he
could be the saboteur.

469
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,150
I just saw him beat the sunshine

470
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:31,640
outta all your storm troopers.

471
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,790
- Oh, dream on, kid.

472
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,700
My boys can handle anything.

473
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,393
Unlike your computer,
they don't g-g-glitch.

474
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,500
- Okay you guys, let me go, all right?

475
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,260
Just put me down.

476
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,470
I've gotta get back to work.

477
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,257
Please, come on.

478
00:26:46,257 --> 00:26:47,090
- Come on.

479
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:48,900
Where are you, Lita?
- Scanning all levels

480
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,493
for employee ID Hayworth, 257797 Bravo.

481
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:58,140
- [Man On Walkie Talkie]
Moonwalker report.

482
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,640
Moonwalker, do you copy, over.

483
00:27:01,493 --> 00:27:03,012
(screaming)

484
00:27:03,012 --> 00:27:05,179
(buzzing)

485
00:27:07,805 --> 00:27:09,284
(man shrieks)
(buzzing)

486
00:27:09,284 --> 00:27:11,300
- Come on, come on.

487
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,181
Hold it, hold it.
- Hold it!

488
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:18,140
(thwacking)
(screaming)

489
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,760
- [Guard] We've got a code red.

490
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,291
Repeat, code red.

491
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:22,468
(alarm blaring)

492
00:27:22,468 --> 00:27:24,630
- [Guard] Man down, man
down, sector 19 level three.

493
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,463
Code red.

494
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:29,490
(suspenseful music)

495
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,950
- Houston.
- What?

496
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,970
- You better get down here,
sub level two, liquidation.

497
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,140
- What is it?
- None of your business.

498
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,620
- Damn it, Houston, tell me what it is!

499
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,453
- Shut up!

500
00:27:41,887 --> 00:27:44,490
And if you're still blabbering
when I get back here,

501
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,393
I'm gonna divorce your
tongue from your mouth.

502
00:27:48,862 --> 00:27:51,410
(suspenseful music)

503
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,150
- [Automated Voice] System failure.

504
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,230
- [Garland] All hell was breaking
loose throughout the park.

505
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:03,230
RCUs out of control, the
outsider on the prowl.

506
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,843
- Well, ginch, I got some
ba-ba-ba-ba-bad news,

507
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,745
and some real bad news.

508
00:28:28,009 --> 00:28:31,000
Bad news is, the Kingpin's
awfully disappointed.

509
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,240
This Garland kid's still suckin' air.

510
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,920
You failed your mission, pallie.

511
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,480
The real bad news is
the Kingpin can't afford

512
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,010
to have anybody snoopin'
around, and that means you.

513
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,283
Nothin' personal, it's just business.

514
00:28:44,182 --> 00:28:45,870
(whacking)

515
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,120
(grunting)

516
00:28:49,151 --> 00:28:50,770
(beeping)

517
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,080
- The violence levels are skyrocketing.

518
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,427
- Somebody tell me what
the hell is going on.

519
00:28:55,427 --> 00:28:56,890
Who triggered the alarm?

520
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,690
It's like a mad house out there.

521
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,523
Garland?

522
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,054
(thwacking)

523
00:29:04,054 --> 00:29:06,553
(grunting)

524
00:29:06,553 --> 00:29:09,153
- Hey, what's goin' on?
- Hey, hold it right there.

525
00:29:10,119 --> 00:29:11,536
- You!
- Get him!

526
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,450
- We've got two stiffs in the basement

527
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,260
that look like they picked
a fight with King Kong.

528
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:21,630
- Dead people, real dead people?

529
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,820
That's impossible.
- Oh yeah?

530
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,920
Check it out yourself.

531
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,010
I still got pieces of them under my shoes.

532
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,120
- No, Gangster World was designed

533
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,730
to reduce violence in society.

534
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,830
People are suppose to take out their anger

535
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:35,490
and frustrations on the RCUs,

536
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,250
not on each other.

537
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,130
That's impossible.

538
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,000
How could this happen?

539
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,380
- Um, sir, Garland thinks

540
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,230
that there's an outsider in the park.

541
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,950
- An infiltrator?

542
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:45,783
Yes.

543
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:47,420
- I suppose that it
could be our competitors

544
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,560
at Cybertronics.

545
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,820
- Of course, who else?

546
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,230
Our ads have been trumpeting
the Donald 3000 for weeks.

547
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,030
They know we're about
to become invincible.

548
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,220
They're trying to stop us.

549
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,200
Houston, get out there
and find that saboteur.

550
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,033
- Yes sir.

551
00:29:58,033 --> 00:29:59,596
- What about the guests?

552
00:29:59,596 --> 00:30:00,690
- What about 'em?
- They're in danger.

553
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,240
Shouldn't we evacuate the park?

554
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,150
- Right, yes, yes.

555
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,820
Tell 'em we're shutting
down for the upgrade

556
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,610
and offer them 500 credits.

557
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,630
Hold on, make it 400.

558
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,540
No wait, 250, that should do it.

559
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,373
- Well, I'm goin' with ya.

560
00:30:14,373 --> 00:30:16,330
- The hell you are.
- Lita's in there.

561
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:18,320
- Look, I thought we covered this.

562
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,850
Dr. Hayworth went home.

563
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,811
- Garland, sit down.

564
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:24,990
And turn off that alarm.

565
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,733
I'll take care of damage control.

566
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,170
- [Garland] The security
teams were deployed

567
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,590
throughout the park.

568
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:35,496
Lucky thing, or at least
so I thought at the time.

569
00:30:35,496 --> 00:30:37,014
- [Guard] Level six clear.

570
00:30:37,014 --> 00:30:39,001
(dramatic music)

571
00:30:39,001 --> 00:30:40,293
(whacking)
(glass shattering)

572
00:30:40,293 --> 00:30:42,083
Cross forward position.

573
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:44,170
(buzzing)

574
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,203
15 clear.

575
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:50,732
(shouting)
(thumping)

576
00:30:50,732 --> 00:30:53,533
(mumbles) Moving into the
Speakeasy, and we are clear.

577
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,470
- [Garland] Evacuation of the guests

578
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,323
was the immediate business at hand.

579
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:00,274
- Hey, what happened?

580
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,849
Turn it back on.

581
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:05,795
- [Guest] Look, I paid money to have--

582
00:31:05,795 --> 00:31:08,733
- He was just about to show
me the torture of 1,000 licks.

583
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,900
- [Garland] For most,
this was a thrill ride

584
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,937
they'd saved for a whole year to enjoy,

585
00:31:14,937 --> 00:31:16,587
and didn't wanna call it a night.

586
00:31:17,421 --> 00:31:18,730
(guests chattering)

587
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:21,040
And evacuation or no evacuation,

588
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:24,743
the big order of the day
was find the saboteur.

589
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,120
- Okay, people, pop quiz.

590
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,860
The functions and memory banks

591
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:33,910
of the Donald 3000 have
been loaded into the system.

592
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:37,773
Claire, for 10 points,
what happens at midnight?

593
00:31:39,257 --> 00:31:42,242
- Um, we've arranged for a power surge

594
00:31:42,242 --> 00:31:44,080
to start up the new software.

595
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,640
- Correct.

596
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,750
Garland, your turn.

597
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,140
What happens if we're not ready

598
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,516
when the power surge hits?

599
00:31:51,516 --> 00:31:52,420
- The system fries.

600
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,940
- That's right, the system fries.

601
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:57,680
And the whole place goes
up like a match box.

602
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,530
Now listen here, boy wonder,

603
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,170
you're gonna plant your
fanny in that chair

604
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,170
for the next 90 minutes

605
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,530
and then you're gonna bring
the new Donald 3000 online

606
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,830
and that's all she wrote.

607
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,500
Now, if you'll excuse me,

608
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,443
I have to go babysit our investors.

609
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,820
They didn't pay all that money

610
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,510
just to see a fireworks
display, now did they?

611
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,283
I don't want anymore foul ups, people.

612
00:32:20,951 --> 00:32:24,080
(suspenseful music)

613
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,007
- Garland, Dr. Greenstreet
just said for you to--

614
00:32:26,007 --> 00:32:29,159
- Claire, I think somebody
slipped Donald the virus.

615
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:30,576
- What?

616
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:32,057
- I'm just gonna go in there

617
00:32:32,057 --> 00:32:34,123
and I'm gonna check on
the bipolar chip, okay?

618
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,590
I'm just makin' a house call.

619
00:32:42,314 --> 00:32:44,437
- [Guard] Be advised, saboteur
is armed and dangerous.

620
00:32:44,437 --> 00:32:46,000
- [Garland] The outsider found himself

621
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,100
hunted by both the guards and the RCUs.

622
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,470
The tables had turned.

623
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:53,075
Now the stalker was being stalked.

624
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:55,422
- [Guard] Blue team is
on point, red is rolling.

625
00:32:55,422 --> 00:32:57,612
- [Guard] Level six clear.

626
00:32:57,612 --> 00:33:02,362
(guards chattering drowned out by music)

627
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,993
- I tried to call Lita at home.

628
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,810
She wasn't there.

629
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:14,460
I wanna run a diagnostic
on the bipolar chip.

630
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,383
Maybe it's been effected
by the power fluctuations.

631
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:19,851
Hold your breath.

632
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,160
All over Gangster World
the RCUs were running wild.

633
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,100
It was almost as if they were conspiring,

634
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,513
as if they had their own private plans.

635
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:39,033
Maybe the saboteur had slipped
the computer a virus somehow.

636
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,580
I was looking for the malfunction

637
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,373
when something shocking happened.

638
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,540
- Garland.

639
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,373
- What?

640
00:33:46,373 --> 00:33:48,303
- [Claire] The violence
levels are dropping.

641
00:33:52,392 --> 00:33:53,559
- Lita!
- What?

642
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:57,614
- Lita, she's in the Speakeasy.

643
00:33:57,614 --> 00:33:59,083
Two of Lorre's men got her.

644
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,333
- What?
- Look!

645
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,845
- Garland, I don't see anything.

646
00:34:05,845 --> 00:34:06,861
- Look, she's in there.

647
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:07,823
You've gotta believe me.

648
00:34:07,823 --> 00:34:09,359
- Garland, Houston said she went home.

649
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,910
- Look, I don't give a
darn what Houston said.

650
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:12,990
The violence levels are down.

651
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:15,768
I'm goin' in.
- No, no, Garland.

652
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:18,300
- Look, if the outsider
sabotaged the computer

653
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,700
then it could've affected
the other systems

654
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,440
including the employee roster, right?

655
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,273
Right.

656
00:34:26,804 --> 00:34:29,090
Once all the guests were out,

657
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:31,750
Houston and the storm troopers went wild.

658
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,450
Pretending to hunt for the saboteur,

659
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:36,900
they began shooting any
RCU that wouldn't freeze,

660
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,353
not realizing the real
danger they were in.

661
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,253
- Oh look.

662
00:34:43,723 --> 00:34:45,690
(gun firing)
(man thuds)

663
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:48,040
- Outstanding, sir.
- Oh, there's one for you.

664
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,677
(gun firing)

665
00:34:50,677 --> 00:34:52,046
- [Houston] Well done.

666
00:34:52,046 --> 00:34:54,690
- Sir, that one's got your
name written all over it.

667
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,676
- This place is lousy with saboteurs.

668
00:34:57,676 --> 00:34:59,530
(gun firing)

669
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,120
I'm beginning to appreciate the--

670
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,275
- Allure?
- Allure of this place.

671
00:35:03,275 --> 00:35:05,659
(laughing)

672
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:07,450
(dramatic music)

673
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,283
- Crime.

674
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,673
Violence.

675
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:17,983
Cruelty.

676
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,553
- I gathered my nerve and
I crept back into the park.

677
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,930
The outsider could attack from anywhere.

678
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,780
I didn't think I could get more frightened

679
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,143
until I saw the bodies of the dead guards.

680
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,893
I'd never seen a corpse before.

681
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,900
There'd be no repairs for these guys.

682
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,733
Lita!

683
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:48,350
And then I remembered
Lita, alone and in danger.

684
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,494
I had to find her, I had to.

685
00:35:50,494 --> 00:35:51,327
Lita!

686
00:35:54,766 --> 00:35:55,599
Lita!

687
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,033
I worked on you.

688
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,735
Lita?

689
00:36:05,735 --> 00:36:09,289
(soft mysterious music)

690
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:10,122
Lita?

691
00:36:13,602 --> 00:36:16,269
(robot humming)

692
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,957
(beeping)

693
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:25,980
- [Automated Voice] Thou
shalt obey every guest's wish.

694
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,293
Thou shalt be true to your program.

695
00:36:28,293 --> 00:36:30,390
Thou shalt kill.

696
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:33,057
(ominous music)

697
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,716
- What's goin' on?

698
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:40,969
No, no, please just put
the knife down, okay?

699
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:41,802
Come on.

700
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:46,517
No, no, I programmed you.

701
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,086
What's goin' on?

702
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:51,919
I...

703
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,686
Listen, there definitely
must be something wrong

704
00:36:54,686 --> 00:36:58,186
with the program.
- Butch, Petey, grab him.

705
00:37:01,029 --> 00:37:01,862
- What?

706
00:37:03,189 --> 00:37:06,868
(thwacking)
(woman shrieks)

707
00:37:06,868 --> 00:37:08,226
(whacking)

708
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,976
(dramatic music)

709
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,623
- You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?

710
00:37:18,077 --> 00:37:18,910
Yah!

711
00:37:21,097 --> 00:37:24,200
(woman thuds)

712
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,990
- Please don't hurt me.

713
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,823
- Come here.

714
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,130
Stop shaking.

715
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,712
- Okay.

716
00:37:31,712 --> 00:37:33,351
Okay.

717
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:34,184
Okay.

718
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,007
- You're breathing because
I decided to let you

719
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:39,773
and I might change my mind, capiche?

720
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:45,241
Now, why would someone want to kill you?

721
00:37:45,241 --> 00:37:46,570
- Someone wants to kill me?

722
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,020
- Yes, I do.

723
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,853
- Why?

724
00:37:48,853 --> 00:37:51,510
- Because a guy named Kingpin paid me to.

725
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,343
- Who's Kingpin?

726
00:37:52,343 --> 00:37:54,180
- I am asking the questions here.

727
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,013
Now, who is he?

728
00:37:55,013 --> 00:37:56,390
- Wait, aren't you some kind of saboteur?

729
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,510
- Just give me a simple answer.

730
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,160
Who is this K-K-K-Kingpin.

731
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,770
- Oh my God, are you an RCU?

732
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,440
- Don't get goofy on me, punk.

733
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,310
Now, who is he?

734
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,580
- I told you, I don't know.

735
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,200
- Then I don't need you.

736
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,790
Nothing personal, it's
a hard, cruel world.

737
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,160
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

738
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,500
It must be Lorre, he's the
main crime boss in the town.

739
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,333
- Lorre?

740
00:38:16,333 --> 00:38:18,930
- Yeah, yeah sure, it makes perfect sense.

741
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,000
You see, he, his men kidnapped Lita

742
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,750
so they must be the ones
trying to kill the both of us.

743
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,060
- All right, if we're gonna rub out Lorre

744
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,810
we better make like the shadow now.

745
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,160
- After I find Lita.

746
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,560
She must be scared to death.

747
00:38:34,627 --> 00:38:37,001
(footsteps clanking)

748
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:40,410
(suspenseful music)

749
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,869
- You are dead, history, smoke, venito,

750
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:44,770
iced, kaput, hasta la vista,
curtains, sayonara, bye bye.

751
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,155
Are you listening to me?

752
00:38:49,155 --> 00:38:50,822
I am talking to you.

753
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:57,880
- Me and the outsider
were not temporary allies.

754
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,220
I had to find the mysterious
Kingpin to save Lita.

755
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,443
He had to find Kingpin to survive.

756
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:07,320
Lorre was top dog in our RCU pound.

757
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,510
He had to be Kingpin.

758
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,220
He had to be.

759
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,003
All right, who are you?

760
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,773
Huh?

761
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,500
How'd you get into the game?

762
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,140
All right, if you're not a saboteur

763
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,310
then why are all the park
systems falling apart?

764
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,155
- Less talk, more walking.

765
00:39:24,155 --> 00:39:26,500
- [Garland] Could the outsider be an RCU?

766
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,150
He had to the telltale stutter

767
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,730
but I needed hard evidence,

768
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,580
so I did what any scientist would do.

769
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:34,877
(thwacking)
(Garland groans)

770
00:39:34,877 --> 00:39:37,477
- Explain before I rub your
teeth into the sidewalk.

771
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:40,230
- You're an RCU.

772
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,180
- What's an RCU?

773
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,000
- A Robotic Carbon Unit.

774
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,833
Ow.

775
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:45,220
- What's a Robotic Carbon Unit?

776
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,419
- A machine, a robot, what you are.

777
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:49,480
- You're not?

778
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,250
- No, I'm human, see?

779
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,810
- What's the difference?

780
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,683
- Look, look!

781
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,550
That's the difference.

782
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,203
- So, it takes all kinds.

783
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,510
- [Garland] My hunch was
right, he was an RCU.

784
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:05,530
But that meant someone had to program him.

785
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,240
Not me for sure, but who?

786
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,460
Maybe a colleague, maybe even a friend,

787
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,563
someone I knew.

788
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,960
- You're scrap metal, do you hear me?

789
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,130
By the end of this week,

790
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:17,740
you are both gonna be license
plates somewhere in Jersey,

791
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,000
this I vow.

792
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,520
Garland is responsible for this, isn't he?

793
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:24,020
He's messing with me because I mocked him.

794
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,270
Stupid tin heads, let me go!

795
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:29,013
Oh, you just wait until
I get my hands on him.

796
00:40:31,008 --> 00:40:32,863
What are you staring at, prune face?

797
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:38,740
- Confucius say when loudmouth speak,

798
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,687
stuff sock in it.

799
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:42,541
- Hey!

800
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:45,041
(Lita whines)

801
00:40:49,812 --> 00:40:52,812
(suspenseful music)

802
00:40:54,338 --> 00:40:57,505
- Now, why would an RCU wanna kill me?

803
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:04,060
Better yet, why does an RCU
hire another RCU to kill me?

804
00:41:04,931 --> 00:41:06,130
Huh?

805
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,240
- Quit buzzing, kid, or
you're gonna get swatted.

806
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,970
- Let me explain somethin' to you.

807
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:10,866
This is not right.

808
00:41:10,866 --> 00:41:13,140
You're supposed to do as you're told.

809
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,830
Well, obviously you
don't do as you're told

810
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:16,663
but you're supposed to.

811
00:41:16,663 --> 00:41:18,850
You see, you're supposed to act according

812
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,510
to your behavioral program.

813
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,433
- Nobody pulls my strings, punk.

814
00:41:23,378 --> 00:41:25,457
(cracking)

815
00:41:25,457 --> 00:41:26,290
- Geez!

816
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,870
Here I thought all computers were perfect

817
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,990
'cause they never let you down.

818
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,823
Hey!

819
00:41:39,066 --> 00:41:40,300
(keys clacking)

820
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,100
- Call me crazy, but I
was under the impression

821
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,913
that when I gave an
order, people followed it.

822
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,713
Where's Garland?

823
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,203
Houston.

824
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,850
- Yeah, Houston here, what's news?

825
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,567
- We have a problem.

826
00:41:55,567 --> 00:41:58,030
The idiot is loose in the park.

827
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,480
Find him and bring him
back before midnight.

828
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,370
- Well, which idiot would that be?

829
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,550
- Garland.

830
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:06,640
- Ah yeah, I got ya, I
read ya loud and clear.

831
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,709
Over and out.

832
00:42:08,709 --> 00:42:10,290
Listen up!

833
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,620
It seems this little dipstick Garland

834
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,780
is here in the park somewhere.

835
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,910
We've gotta find him as
well as the saboteur.

836
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:20,190
Robinson, O'Brien, I want
you to go up Hawk Street.

837
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,390
Mason and I are goin'
down Privenger Boulevard.

838
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:24,520
And if this little twerp
gives you any problems

839
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,050
when you find him,
you've got my permission

840
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,560
to beat him within an inch of his life.

841
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:29,393
Move!

842
00:42:30,558 --> 00:42:31,391
- Look, we got held down already.

843
00:42:31,391 --> 00:42:33,020
We can't just barge in.

844
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,267
We need a plan.

845
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:36,680
- I have a plan.

846
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,883
- Oh yeah?

847
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,220
Lorre's got a half
dozen goons in his gang.

848
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,960
They're all programmed
to be blood-thirsty,

849
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,700
knife-wielding maniacs,

850
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,940
and we've gotta surprise them.

851
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,970
- I have a plan.

852
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,070
- Oh, you have a plan.

853
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:53,797
Psst, hey, smart guy.

854
00:42:53,797 --> 00:42:54,714
This is it.

855
00:42:57,114 --> 00:42:58,350
Okay, what are you gonna do?

856
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:00,591
- Trust me, I have a plan.
- Okay.

857
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:02,439
(crashing)

858
00:43:02,439 --> 00:43:04,770
That's your plan, kick
the door down and charge?

859
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:06,531
- We're in, aren't we?

860
00:43:06,531 --> 00:43:08,278
(Lita moaning)

861
00:43:08,278 --> 00:43:11,900
(mysterious music)

862
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:16,663
- Welcome to my lair, said
the spider to the fly.

863
00:43:17,509 --> 00:43:19,420
(Garland gulps)

864
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,253
Filet them!

865
00:43:27,066 --> 00:43:27,899
- You.

866
00:43:32,158 --> 00:43:33,825
Well, we meet again.

867
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,510
- Astor, get outta here.

868
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:38,170
- Quit your yappin'.

869
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:40,460
I'm trying to communicate here.

870
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:45,070
So, how about a tumble before the rumble?

871
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:48,840
- Kazu, get her.
- Let's go.

872
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,930
- Get your grimy hands off me

873
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:53,729
you poor excuse for an adult.

874
00:43:53,729 --> 00:43:55,362
(knocking)

875
00:43:55,362 --> 00:43:57,224
(dramatic music)

876
00:43:57,224 --> 00:43:59,120
(whacking)

877
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,370
(grunting)

878
00:44:04,198 --> 00:44:05,249
(crashing)

879
00:44:05,249 --> 00:44:06,931
- Get the incompetent fools!

880
00:44:06,931 --> 00:44:08,348
Fix him for good!

881
00:44:09,232 --> 00:44:14,232
(shrieking)
(thudding)

882
00:44:14,628 --> 00:44:15,757
(knocking)

883
00:44:15,757 --> 00:44:19,419
- Lorre, how dare you
play rough without me.

884
00:44:19,419 --> 00:44:21,669
(shouting)

885
00:44:22,723 --> 00:44:24,930
(whacking)

886
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:27,180
(grunting)

887
00:44:28,529 --> 00:44:30,751
(groaning)

888
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:35,751
(window shatters)
(screaming)

889
00:44:36,818 --> 00:44:39,151
(shrieking)

890
00:44:40,658 --> 00:44:43,241
(Lita screams)

891
00:44:44,841 --> 00:44:45,674
- Lita!

892
00:44:49,221 --> 00:44:51,454
Lita, Lita, I'm coming.

893
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:52,287
Hold on.

894
00:44:55,008 --> 00:44:56,753
Oh no!
- Hiya, sweet cakes.

895
00:44:56,753 --> 00:44:58,290
- Get away from her!

896
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,894
Get away from her!

897
00:44:59,894 --> 00:45:00,969
Lita.

898
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:02,150
- Garland, get me out of this!

899
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,254
- Nix on the screamin', kid.

900
00:45:04,254 --> 00:45:05,720
(thudding)

901
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:06,710
- I'll be right there.

902
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:07,964
Wait.

903
00:45:07,964 --> 00:45:09,464
No, let go of her.

904
00:45:10,585 --> 00:45:12,436
Let go of her!

905
00:45:12,436 --> 00:45:13,560
(man shrieks)

906
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:14,393
Lita!

907
00:45:15,341 --> 00:45:16,370
I'm coming.

908
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:18,920
- Oh, what's the score, handsome?

909
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,270
- Rath the bolt's got Lita.

910
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,170
- I know those two.

911
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:26,220
They work for Kingpin.

912
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,550
- No, they don't, they work for Rains.

913
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:29,160
- No, they work for Kingpin.

914
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,451
- I'm tellin' ya, they work...

915
00:45:31,451 --> 00:45:32,510
(ominous music)

916
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,410
Rains is Kingpin.
- Rains is Kingpin.

917
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,313
- Well, what are we waiting for?

918
00:45:36,313 --> 00:45:37,770
Come on, let's go.

919
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,480
- Take me with you, lover.

920
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,990
I'm real good in a tight squeeze.

921
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,730
- Sorry, gorgeous.

922
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:46,113
Two is company, three is a crowd.

923
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,853
- Come on.
- Go.

924
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,390
- This time it was Rains'
boys who nabbed Lita

925
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:58,232
and they made damn sure that I saw them,

926
00:45:58,232 --> 00:45:59,330
but why?

927
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,420
None of it made any sense,

928
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,383
unless they were using her as bait.

929
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,520
It was like playing cards with someone

930
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,560
who marked the deck and
knew your every move.

931
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:13,075
The Kingpin was always one step ahead.

932
00:46:13,075 --> 00:46:14,240
Claire.

933
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,330
Claire, come in.

934
00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:17,160
- Garland, where are you?

935
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:17,993
- Rains has Lita.

936
00:46:17,993 --> 00:46:19,353
I'm going in there, I'm gonna find her,

937
00:46:19,353 --> 00:46:20,890
and I'll be back before
there's any problem.

938
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:23,070
Just don't tell Greenstreet.

939
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,620
- Surprise, Sherlock.

940
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:27,090
She doesn't need to tell
me because you just did.

941
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,450
Now get your little
fanny back here before--

942
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:30,770
- Sorry, sir, the system's failure

943
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:32,550
must've reached the
communications systems.

944
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:34,850
- Garland, don't pull
that old trick on me.

945
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:35,914
- Uh.

946
00:46:35,914 --> 00:46:36,747
(buzzing)

947
00:46:36,747 --> 00:46:38,301
I'm trying to

948
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:39,317
respond.

949
00:46:39,317 --> 00:46:41,202
Uh, I'm going later--

950
00:46:41,202 --> 00:46:43,550
- Don't you dare hang up on me, young man.

951
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,497
Don't you dare, do you hear?

952
00:46:45,497 --> 00:46:47,930
(static crackling)

953
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:48,763
- Thanks.

954
00:46:48,763 --> 00:46:50,010
- Don't mention it.

955
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,848
- Call up Houston and tell him

956
00:46:51,848 --> 00:46:53,700
to get over to Rains' bootlegging parlor

957
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,380
and bag himself a nut.

958
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,970
- Mr. Houston.

959
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,807
Come in, Mr. Houston.

960
00:46:58,807 --> 00:46:59,807
Mr. Houst...

961
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:03,302
(garbled speech)

962
00:47:03,302 --> 00:47:04,781
- You're breakin' up, I can't hear you.

963
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:05,713
- Mr. Houston.

964
00:47:05,713 --> 00:47:06,890
I can't get him.

965
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,563
- Can't I talk to anyone around here?

966
00:47:12,932 --> 00:47:15,240
- Houston--
- Useless machines.

967
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:17,330
Hello?
- Houston, do you copy?

968
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:18,440
- Hello?

969
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,227
- [Kingpin] Alan Houston, forgive me,

970
00:47:20,227 --> 00:47:22,730
you used to be an officer
in the Green Berets,

971
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:24,300
Major Alan Houston.

972
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,670
- Who the hell is this?
- A friend.

973
00:47:26,670 --> 00:47:28,210
- Identify yourself.

974
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:32,570
- I know your mind.
- Identify yourself, asshole.

975
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:33,420
Who is this?

976
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,290
- [Kingpin] You're upset
because in 60 minutes

977
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:37,950
the new Donald 3000 will be up and running

978
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:40,041
and you'll be out of a job.

979
00:47:40,041 --> 00:47:42,440
Perhaps you're even a little frightened,

980
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:45,240
for where can a dinosaur
like you find work

981
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,830
in this new world?

982
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:50,780
I see you ending your days
fat, poor, and desperate,

983
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,860
discarded like a once favored toy.

984
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,263
Unless--
- Unless?

985
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:59,080
- [Kingpin] Garland, destroy him, Houston.

986
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,650
It's his kind that have
stolen the world away

987
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:04,336
from men with courage and muscles

988
00:48:04,336 --> 00:48:08,570
and handed it over to boys with keyboards.

989
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:10,440
- Who the fuck is this?

990
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,113
- [Kingpin] Someone who shares your goals.

991
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:18,650
- Saboteur.
- Elementary, my dear Houston.

992
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:20,010
Now, enough chatter.

993
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,420
The boy is at Rains' bootlegging parlor.

994
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:25,940
What is that parlance you
used in the army, do me proud.

995
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:28,150
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

996
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:29,470
What am I supposed to call you?

997
00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:31,530
- [Kingpin] Names are not important.

998
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:34,793
But if you prefer, you
may address me as Kingpin.

999
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:37,460
- So what's the buzz?

1000
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,293
- New order.

1001
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,630
We find the outsider, we shoot to kill.

1002
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,330
- What if the kid gets in the way?

1003
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,863
- We have our orders.

1004
00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:50,110
All right, lock down the perimeter.

1005
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,500
Bravo company, fall in.

1006
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,790
- [Garland] As we headed
across Gangster World

1007
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,140
to Rains' hangout, I still wasn't sure

1008
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,760
if I could trust the outsider.

1009
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,190
And then again, I didn't have much choice.

1010
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:00,180
Lita's life was on the line

1011
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,680
and I was determined to
show her I was no rah-rah.

1012
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,030
- Quit staring at my balls.

1013
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:08,050
- I'm not staring at your balls.

1014
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,210
- You were too, stop it.

1015
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:12,080
- I'm not staring at your stupid balls.

1016
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,447
I was thinkin' about Lita

1017
00:49:13,447 --> 00:49:14,580
and what she must be going through.

1018
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:15,480
- She's a dame.

1019
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,620
Don't worry about her.

1020
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,409
- Don't worry about her?

1021
00:49:18,409 --> 00:49:19,810
Of course, how could I expect you

1022
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:21,170
to say anything else?

1023
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:23,690
You're a machine, you
don't have any feelings.

1024
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:25,433
- It's a hard, cruel world, kid.

1025
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:28,720
You gotta look out for
number one or you're dead.

1026
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,680
- Well, I'm lookin' out for Lita

1027
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,980
'cause without her there's
no reason not to be dead.

1028
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:35,100
- You think she'd do the same for you?

1029
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,050
- I know she would.

1030
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,660
Yeah, I know she would.

1031
00:49:40,334 --> 00:49:44,670
- Ooh Garland, just you wait
until I get out of here.

1032
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:48,810
First order of the day,
Garland never walks again.

1033
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:50,830
And as for you, you, and you,

1034
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:53,303
you are scrap metal, do you hear me?

1035
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:56,223
- You know, I'm beginning to see

1036
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,683
why Lorre kept her bottled up.

1037
00:49:59,661 --> 00:50:00,578
- [Man] 20.

1038
00:50:01,871 --> 00:50:04,621
(chips clanking)

1039
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,313
- Play.

1040
00:50:10,022 --> 00:50:14,363
I'll see your 20, and
I'll raise you another.

1041
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,990
- He's bluffing.

1042
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,030
- Shut up, or I'll fix it

1043
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:19,930
so you don't torture anymore eardrums.

1044
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:21,953
- I'm in.

1045
00:50:23,886 --> 00:50:26,050
(imitating chicken clucking)

1046
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,310
- Shut up, you silly bitch.

1047
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:29,690
- Don't you yell at me

1048
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:32,750
or I'll tell them about
the ace up your sleeve.

1049
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:34,212
- [Man] Boss!

1050
00:50:34,212 --> 00:50:37,212
(suspenseful music)

1051
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:43,374
(thwacking)

1052
00:50:49,406 --> 00:50:50,904
- I'm out.
- I'm out.

1053
00:50:50,904 --> 00:50:53,030
(man thuds)

1054
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,903
- Now look what you made me do.

1055
00:50:54,903 --> 00:50:55,736
- Oopsy.

1056
00:50:58,573 --> 00:51:01,073
(tense music)

1057
00:51:08,306 --> 00:51:10,556
(whacking)

1058
00:51:12,786 --> 00:51:15,369
- Come here, you little weasel.

1059
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:22,657
(crashing)

1060
00:51:22,657 --> 00:51:25,003
Ooh ho, quit squirmin' you termite.

1061
00:51:25,003 --> 00:51:27,253
(grunting)

1062
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:32,275
- No!

1063
00:51:32,275 --> 00:51:33,525
(crashing)

1064
00:51:33,525 --> 00:51:34,358
Help me!

1065
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:41,300
(thudding)

1066
00:51:50,543 --> 00:51:51,940
What, what, what?

1067
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:53,113
What, what is it?

1068
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,390
We were closing in on Rains

1069
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:01,133
but so were Houston's troops.

1070
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:05,000
- Oh, this is gonna be good.

1071
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,490
- [Garland] They'd made a
fatal error in judgment,

1072
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:09,460
figured the RCUs could still be tamed

1073
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,233
with a simple press of a button.

1074
00:52:13,898 --> 00:52:16,061
- [Lita] No! (screams)

1075
00:52:16,061 --> 00:52:16,894
- Lita!

1076
00:52:16,894 --> 00:52:18,443
(dramatic music)

1077
00:52:18,443 --> 00:52:20,343
- [Guard] We have contact.

1078
00:52:20,343 --> 00:52:22,210
(Rains' men laughing)

1079
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,483
- Finally, what took you so long?

1080
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:28,078
- Nix on the fancy toys, boys.

1081
00:52:28,078 --> 00:52:30,202
(gun firing)

1082
00:52:30,202 --> 00:52:32,597
- [Guard] Shots fired, shots fired!

1083
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,735
(saucy music)

1084
00:52:42,186 --> 00:52:44,769
(Lita screams)

1085
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,230
(Lita whimpers)
(man laughs)

1086
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:50,063
- Lita!

1087
00:52:52,874 --> 00:52:55,900
(Lita screams)

1088
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:57,003
Geez, oh.

1089
00:52:57,852 --> 00:52:59,000
Wait.
- What?

1090
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,360
- We need a plan.

1091
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,978
Come on, suckers, I'm callin' ya out.

1092
00:53:02,978 --> 00:53:04,876
I'm callin' all-a-yas.

1093
00:53:04,876 --> 00:53:06,753
- Garland!
- The gates.

1094
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:10,710
- Oh, what's the matter, Rains?

1095
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:11,901
You yelluh?

1096
00:53:11,901 --> 00:53:14,674
I'll take you with one
hand tied behind my back,

1097
00:53:14,674 --> 00:53:15,623
blindfolded.

1098
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:22,314
Sorry, suckers, better
luck next time. (cackles)

1099
00:53:22,314 --> 00:53:24,038
- It's a bum steer!
- Fooled you.

1100
00:53:24,038 --> 00:53:28,833
(crashing)
(Lita screams)

1101
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:29,815
Let's go!

1102
00:53:29,815 --> 00:53:32,981
(whacking)
(grunting)

1103
00:53:32,981 --> 00:53:33,898
Behind you!

1104
00:53:37,382 --> 00:53:39,864
(Lita shrieks)

1105
00:53:39,864 --> 00:53:42,614
(dramatic music)

1106
00:53:49,843 --> 00:53:52,176
(thwacking)

1107
00:53:56,538 --> 00:53:58,705
(banging)

1108
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:07,576
(glass shattering)

1109
00:54:07,576 --> 00:54:09,672
(crashing)

1110
00:54:09,672 --> 00:54:11,517
- [Lita] Garland, look out!

1111
00:54:11,517 --> 00:54:12,350
- Jesus!

1112
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:14,323
No, Rains, come on.

1113
00:54:14,323 --> 00:54:15,210
This is wrong.

1114
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,297
You don't wanna do this.

1115
00:54:16,297 --> 00:54:19,243
- Sorry, you're wrong, k-k-k-k-kid.

1116
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,070
I'm with the program.

1117
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:23,140
It's yous outta line.

1118
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,553
It's time to cash in
the chips, game's over.

1119
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,613
(gun clicking)

1120
00:54:32,233 --> 00:54:33,440
Huh.

1121
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,830
Well, looks like old lady luck

1122
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:37,550
has put the hex on me again.

1123
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:38,693
- So, you're Kingpin.

1124
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,553
- Me?

1125
00:54:40,553 --> 00:54:42,360
No, no, no, no, I'm just a tired old sap.

1126
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,340
Wouldn't hurt a fly.

1127
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:46,763
Tell you what, why don't you
and I play a little game.

1128
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:50,580
It's called Dead Man's Flush.

1129
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:53,613
Aces win.

1130
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:56,880
(smacking)

1131
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,494
Two outta three?

1132
00:54:58,494 --> 00:54:59,695
- One will do.

1133
00:54:59,695 --> 00:55:01,275
(thwacking)

1134
00:55:01,275 --> 00:55:02,662
(grunting)

1135
00:55:02,662 --> 00:55:04,659
(thudding)

1136
00:55:04,659 --> 00:55:05,603
- Garland!

1137
00:55:05,603 --> 00:55:06,490
Don't--
- No, don't worry.

1138
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:08,010
Don't worry, don't worry, he's with me.

1139
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,650
- I know, but he's an RCU.

1140
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,440
- It's okay, I'll explain
everything later, okay?

1141
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,160
- Garland, none of the
fail safes are working.

1142
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,230
They killed two guards
and they were gonna,

1143
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:16,540
where is the rest of the rescue team?

1144
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:18,600
- There is no rescue team.

1145
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,890
- You mean they're not with you?

1146
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:22,260
You did this?
- No.

1147
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:26,623
- All by yourself?
(Garland mumbles)

1148
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:27,456
- Huh?

1149
00:55:27,456 --> 00:55:29,040
- [Lita] You risked your life to save me.

1150
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:30,933
Thank you.

1151
00:55:30,933 --> 00:55:32,693
- You woulda done the same for me.

1152
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:38,300
(dramatic music)

1153
00:55:43,482 --> 00:55:45,631
- Robinson and O'Brien.
- Where?

1154
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:48,527
- There, there, there.

1155
00:55:48,527 --> 00:55:50,380
Mm, there.

1156
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:52,062
- Martyrs for the cause.

1157
00:55:52,062 --> 00:55:53,190
- What cause?

1158
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,950
- The cause of putting Garland

1159
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,020
on the endangered species list.

1160
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,760
Make sure that's the only way out.

1161
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,850
These guys don't have their weapons.

1162
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:01,769
That means the kid may be armed.

1163
00:56:01,769 --> 00:56:02,602
- Right.

1164
00:56:09,137 --> 00:56:10,340
- Garland, what is going on?

1165
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,420
The whole park is out of control.

1166
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,040
- Listen, all I know is
that we have to get back

1167
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,440
before the old program
goes out with a big bang.

1168
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,360
- Attention all teams.

1169
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,200
I've got the saboteur cornered

1170
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,250
in Rains' bootlegging parlor.

1171
00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:25,130
Surround this place on the double!

1172
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:27,810
Lock and load people, move into position.

1173
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,210
Rothwell, get into position.

1174
00:56:30,348 --> 00:56:31,726
(gun firing)
(shrieking)

1175
00:56:31,726 --> 00:56:33,210
Ah, crap!

1176
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:35,930
- Houston, don't shoot, it's me.

1177
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:37,113
- I know.

1178
00:56:37,113 --> 00:56:38,723
- What do you think you're doin'?

1179
00:56:38,723 --> 00:56:39,556
What are you, crazy?

1180
00:56:39,556 --> 00:56:41,310
What's Greenstreet gonna say?

1181
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:42,510
- Ah, screw Greenstreet.

1182
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:44,580
I work for Kingpin now.

1183
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:46,710
- Kingpin?
- Houston too.

1184
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:47,760
- [Minesweeper] This is Minesweeper.

1185
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,383
Time to target is 40 seconds.

1186
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:53,100
- Where in the hell is my backup, people?

1187
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,800
Let's go, move it!

1188
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:56,690
Just so there's no misunderstanding,

1189
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:59,203
I want you to know this, this is personal.

1190
00:57:00,242 --> 00:57:02,870
(gun firing)

1191
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:04,840
- Houston, what did I ever do to you?

1192
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,140
- Well, you want the short list?

1193
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,580
I spent 20 years in the service

1194
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,963
protecting freedom for
little bastards like you

1195
00:57:10,963 --> 00:57:13,430
just so you can take it away from me.

1196
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:17,260
You trap me in this world
of fiber optic fences,

1197
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,270
internet cells.

1198
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,360
I can't even take a dump anywhere

1199
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,060
without some computer knowing about it.

1200
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,100
- So what, you think by killing me

1201
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:28,847
you're gonna change that?
- Oh, hell no.

1202
00:57:28,847 --> 00:57:32,765
But it'll sure make me
feel a whole lot better.

1203
00:57:32,765 --> 00:57:34,313
(gun firing)

1204
00:57:34,313 --> 00:57:35,596
- Go, go, go!

1205
00:57:35,596 --> 00:57:37,910
Go, go, go.

1206
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:40,857
Houston, Houston this is absurd.

1207
00:57:40,857 --> 00:57:43,087
Now can't we just
discuss this like mature,

1208
00:57:43,087 --> 00:57:45,860
civilized adult human beings?

1209
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:46,693
- Sure.

1210
00:57:47,583 --> 00:57:49,037
(gun firing)

1211
00:57:49,037 --> 00:57:50,695
- [Guard] We have visual
on your position, over.

1212
00:57:50,695 --> 00:57:51,982
(speech drowned out by dramatic music)

1213
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:54,670
(gun firing)

1214
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:57,080
- That's it, I'm gonna kick his brains in.

1215
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:57,913
- No.

1216
00:57:57,913 --> 00:57:59,180
He'll cut you to pieces.

1217
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,600
Now listen, there is a time for brawn

1218
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,910
and there's a time for brains,

1219
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:04,720
and this is most emphatically
not a time for brawn.

1220
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,243
- You c-c-callin' me stupid?
- If the shoe fits, wear it.

1221
00:58:08,243 --> 00:58:09,730
- I've had it with you, punk.

1222
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:10,930
- Don't call me that, you thug.

1223
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:12,403
- Boys, boys.

1224
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:16,656
So much testosterone in this room.

1225
00:58:16,656 --> 00:58:17,830
- You?

1226
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,503
- In the flesh.

1227
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,220
- Where did you come from, huh?

1228
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,053
Where did you come from?

1229
00:58:25,053 --> 00:58:27,013
- Do you enjoy having hands?

1230
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:30,070
Lorre's secret passageway.

1231
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:31,310
- Come on, take me, show me.

1232
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:33,220
- Wait, you're actually gonna trust her?

1233
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:34,120
- Yes.

1234
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:37,070
- Squirt, haven't see you since you,

1235
00:58:37,070 --> 00:58:40,240
s-s-sucker punched me at the club.

1236
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,180
- Still wearing my
fingerprints on your snout?

1237
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,323
- Care to take another shot, honey?

1238
00:58:47,412 --> 00:58:48,751
Didn't think so.

1239
00:58:48,751 --> 00:58:51,285
(gun firing)

1240
00:58:51,285 --> 00:58:53,120
- [Guard] Take five, weapons free.

1241
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,740
- [Guard] Houston, we are
ready to rock and roll.

1242
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,253
Check, red moving in.

1243
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,040
- We gotta come up with something,

1244
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,360
some kinda diversion.

1245
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,500
Houston's gonna be breathing
down our necks like crazy.

1246
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,490
- A booby trap?
- Yeah.

1247
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:07,684
- [Guard] Watch the door, closing in.

1248
00:59:07,684 --> 00:59:08,912
- Repeat that.

1249
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:11,490
- Wait, does anybody have a knife?

1250
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:13,610
- Yeah, yeah, I got this.

1251
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:14,905
Here.

1252
00:59:14,905 --> 00:59:16,155
- Okay, give me this guy.

1253
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:19,688
- What are you gonna do?
- Okay.

1254
00:59:20,565 --> 00:59:21,680
- Ew.

1255
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,043
- Just a little cerebellum realignment.

1256
00:59:24,929 --> 00:59:27,679
(dramatic music)

1257
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:33,323
Bypass main function, access reflexes.

1258
00:59:34,443 --> 00:59:36,423
Wait a minute, go get me bozo's gun.

1259
00:59:36,423 --> 00:59:37,494
- Great.

1260
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:39,161
That's a great idea.

1261
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,920
- [Guard] Crossbow in the kill zone.

1262
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,880
Standing by, weapons free.

1263
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,830
Houston, we are ready to rock and roll.

1264
00:59:49,763 --> 00:59:51,330
- Hey kid, what's the matter?

1265
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:52,827
A cat got your tongue?

1266
00:59:57,103 --> 01:00:02,103
(Garland grunts)
(gun clicks)

1267
01:00:02,722 --> 01:00:04,884
- Here you go, Doctor.

1268
01:00:04,884 --> 01:00:07,134
(sizzling)

1269
01:00:08,283 --> 01:00:10,633
- This girl's got a good
head on her shoulders.

1270
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:14,773
- Too bad the rest of
her is underdeveloped.

1271
01:00:20,938 --> 01:00:22,910
(suspenseful music)

1272
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:24,523
- How about a little whimpering?

1273
01:00:24,523 --> 01:00:26,037
Help me enjoy this.

1274
01:00:26,037 --> 01:00:28,717
(gun firing)

1275
01:00:28,717 --> 01:00:31,467
(shell clinking)

1276
01:00:33,410 --> 01:00:34,430
- All done.

1277
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,700
If anyone comes through that door,

1278
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:37,150
the motion will trigger the optic nerve

1279
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:38,410
which in turn will
trigger the index finger

1280
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:40,533
which in turn will trigger the trigger.

1281
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,593
- All teams move in pronto.
- Check, red moving in.

1282
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,690
Crossbow in place, 20 yards away.

1283
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,250
Walker, 10 yards away.

1284
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,234
- Good work, Doctor.

1285
01:00:56,234 --> 01:00:57,067
Come on, let's go.

1286
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,430
- [Minesweeper] Roger that,
Minesweeper is in the loop

1287
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:02,423
five yards away.

1288
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:06,204
(banging)

1289
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,621
(gun firing)

1290
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,143
- All teams move in pronto!
- Go, go, go!

1291
01:01:13,223 --> 01:01:15,460
- Saboteur's armed and deadly.

1292
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,683
Use deadly force.

1293
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:22,033
I'm under fire, I need backup now.

1294
01:01:24,721 --> 01:01:27,185
- [Garland] Move, move.

1295
01:01:27,185 --> 01:01:29,768
(gun clicking)

1296
01:01:45,947 --> 01:01:48,197
(whacking)

1297
01:01:49,248 --> 01:01:51,365
- [Houston] Garland!

1298
01:01:51,365 --> 01:01:53,000
- Look, a trap door.
- Get him!

1299
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,850
- [Astor] Pick it up, boys and girls.

1300
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:00,879
- Where's the nearest portal?
- The Speakeasy.

1301
01:02:00,879 --> 01:02:01,896
Come on.

1302
01:02:01,896 --> 01:02:04,896
(suspenseful music)

1303
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:09,485
Hey!

1304
01:02:09,485 --> 01:02:10,860
(grunting)
(thuds)

1305
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,750
- Okay, back off, tough guy

1306
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:14,940
or thunder thighs here gets it.

1307
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:18,110
- That's a big gun for such a small man.

1308
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,820
You got somethin' to prove?
- Shut up.

1309
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:21,710
- Mason, what are you doin'?

1310
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:23,400
- Protecting my job.

1311
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,390
All right, I got a little
present for everybody.

1312
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:29,810
- Ooh, you gonna drop your pants?

1313
01:02:29,810 --> 01:02:32,654
- Quick tongue, a pity to waste.

1314
01:02:32,654 --> 01:02:37,404
(shrieking)
(gun firing)

1315
01:02:38,411 --> 01:02:40,661
(whacking)

1316
01:02:43,918 --> 01:02:46,085
(banging)

1317
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,781
You're smoke--
- Now, bitch.

1318
01:02:49,781 --> 01:02:52,614
(Mason screaming)

1319
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:57,980
- I'm out of here.
- Forget this.

1320
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:00,730
- Go, go, go!
- I'm going, I'm going.

1321
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:02,063
- Go!
- I'm gone.

1322
01:03:03,871 --> 01:03:05,455
- Come back here!

1323
01:03:05,455 --> 01:03:07,313
Come back here!

1324
01:03:07,313 --> 01:03:10,146
(Mason screaming)

1325
01:03:16,677 --> 01:03:18,683
I am your commanding officer.

1326
01:03:18,683 --> 01:03:20,842
Come back here, do as I say!

1327
01:03:20,842 --> 01:03:22,513
- Move it.
- Leave without him.

1328
01:03:22,513 --> 01:03:25,410
- Go, go, go.
- Come on, let's move.

1329
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:27,590
- All right, ladies, I don't need you.

1330
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:29,163
I'll take care of this myself.

1331
01:03:30,924 --> 01:03:33,991
(Mason thuds)

1332
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:35,529
- Big boy.

1333
01:03:35,529 --> 01:03:37,591
You took a bullet for me.

1334
01:03:37,591 --> 01:03:39,860
How can I ever repay you?

1335
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:41,643
- I'm sure you'll think of something.

1336
01:03:42,770 --> 01:03:43,770
Grab the extra clip.

1337
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:47,230
- [Garland] Let's go.

1338
01:03:48,217 --> 01:03:51,160
(beeping)

1339
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,680
- [Greenstreet] For God sakes, Claire,

1340
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,900
what do I pay you for?

1341
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:55,810
Can't you get him on the screen?

1342
01:03:55,810 --> 01:03:57,803
- He's turned his tracker off.

1343
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,470
- Claire, I am very, very,
very disappointed in you.

1344
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:06,010
I thought I could rely on you,

1345
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:09,093
but apparently you just let
Garland push you around.

1346
01:04:11,719 --> 01:04:12,580
(RCUs growling)

1347
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:13,533
- Ah, shit.

1348
01:04:14,676 --> 01:04:15,769
Mason?

1349
01:04:15,769 --> 01:04:16,602
Mason?

1350
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:17,916
Come in, Mason.

1351
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:18,749
Help me!

1352
01:04:18,749 --> 01:04:21,471
All right, you tin bastards, let's go.

1353
01:04:21,471 --> 01:04:22,930
Come on, first come, first served.

1354
01:04:23,906 --> 01:04:25,740
- [Kingpin] Houston,
Houston, is that any way

1355
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,620
to treat your loyal corps?

1356
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:28,453
- What?

1357
01:04:28,453 --> 01:04:30,500
- [Kingpin] I'm afraid
I've been unfair to you.

1358
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,300
A military man like ourself

1359
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,810
needs an army to back him up, Major,

1360
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:36,350
so I'm giving you one.

1361
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:37,920
Use them, command them.

1362
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,170
Achieve your full potential.

1363
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:42,041
Just don't fail me again.

1364
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:45,700
(Houston laughing)

1365
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:46,810
(suspenseful music)

1366
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:48,150
- [Garland] We were pinned down

1367
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:49,750
and had to lay low in the boiler room

1368
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:52,620
until we could get back
to the control room.

1369
01:04:52,620 --> 01:04:55,140
I was still reeling from
the blow to my head,

1370
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:56,210
but as the fog cleared,

1371
01:04:56,210 --> 01:04:58,303
everything seemed to fall into place.

1372
01:04:58,303 --> 01:04:59,820
- Let me see, I am a doctor.

1373
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:01,340
- [Garland] The answers
to all my questions

1374
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,170
suddenly seemed so obvious,

1375
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:06,190
who the Kingpin was,
why he wanted me dead,

1376
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:08,160
and with it came a terrible thought.

1377
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,900
Getting out of the park
was going to be harder

1378
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,500
than I could have ever imagined.

1379
01:05:20,477 --> 01:05:21,310
- Come here.

1380
01:05:21,310 --> 01:05:23,700
- As Lita tended to my wounds,

1381
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:26,863
I witnessed the most amazing thing of all.

1382
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:32,070
Our RCU allies were exploring
the same emotions we were,

1383
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:33,933
sharing a tender moment together.

1384
01:05:35,172 --> 01:05:37,784
Lita, look.

1385
01:05:37,784 --> 01:05:39,637
- Amazing.
- Yeah.

1386
01:05:39,637 --> 01:05:42,953
- Garland, how did this happen?

1387
01:05:42,953 --> 01:05:43,786
- I don't know.

1388
01:05:43,786 --> 01:05:47,340
Near as I can figure,
virus got into the RCUs'

1389
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:50,387
behavioral system.
- But who put it there?

1390
01:05:51,737 --> 01:05:55,289
And how could it alter
them to such an extent?

1391
01:05:55,289 --> 01:05:57,120
He almost died for her.

1392
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,653
Self-sacrifice isn't even in the program.

1393
01:06:00,859 --> 01:06:01,692
- [Garland] I know.

1394
01:06:02,562 --> 01:06:05,145
(gentle music)

1395
01:06:07,899 --> 01:06:08,895
- No.

1396
01:06:08,895 --> 01:06:10,655
No, don't do that.

1397
01:06:10,655 --> 01:06:11,971
(electric buzzing)

1398
01:06:11,971 --> 01:06:12,971
- Find them.

1399
01:06:14,509 --> 01:06:15,342
Kill them.

1400
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:18,242
Torture them.

1401
01:06:18,242 --> 01:06:20,856
(sizzling)

1402
01:06:20,856 --> 01:06:23,523
(ominous music)

1403
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:30,703
- Trouble.

1404
01:06:36,390 --> 01:06:37,406
(gun firing)

1405
01:06:37,406 --> 01:06:40,116
(grunting)
(thudding)

1406
01:06:40,116 --> 01:06:42,533
(gun firing)

1407
01:06:44,311 --> 01:06:46,728
(gun clicks)

1408
01:06:47,968 --> 01:06:50,218
(whacking)

1409
01:06:52,569 --> 01:06:54,819
(shouting)

1410
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,541
- What are we gonna do now?

1411
01:06:59,541 --> 01:07:00,410
- Oh, I don't know.

1412
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:01,516
What are those?

1413
01:07:01,516 --> 01:07:03,277
- Uh, cables to Rains' parlor.

1414
01:07:03,277 --> 01:07:05,834
- They can get us out.

1415
01:07:05,834 --> 01:07:07,624
(shouting)

1416
01:07:07,624 --> 01:07:08,655
- What are you doing?

1417
01:07:08,655 --> 01:07:10,155
- I've got a plan.

1418
01:07:13,004 --> 01:07:13,837
Ready?

1419
01:07:16,094 --> 01:07:16,927
Jump!

1420
01:07:18,082 --> 01:07:20,832
(dramatic music)

1421
01:07:37,608 --> 01:07:40,525
(electric buzzing)

1422
01:07:46,342 --> 01:07:48,509
(beeping)

1423
01:07:51,316 --> 01:07:53,566
(shouting)

1424
01:08:09,676 --> 01:08:10,509
No!

1425
01:08:14,436 --> 01:08:16,603
(beeping)

1426
01:08:18,363 --> 01:08:20,150
- Claire, can you not figure out

1427
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:21,710
what's causing all of this?

1428
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:24,580
- I'm reading a massive
electrical discharge.

1429
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:27,399
- Where?
- Sector six.

1430
01:08:27,399 --> 01:08:29,793
- Sector six, is that important?

1431
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:34,160
- It, it's where Garland went.

1432
01:08:35,627 --> 01:08:38,627
(suspenseful music)

1433
01:08:42,212 --> 01:08:45,045
(machine humming)

1434
01:08:47,379 --> 01:08:49,120
- Come on, Lita, come on.

1435
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:50,610
Stay close.

1436
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:51,673
Everybody stay tight.

1437
01:08:55,815 --> 01:08:59,370
(whacking)
(shouting)

1438
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:01,620
(grunting)

1439
01:09:12,777 --> 01:09:15,027
(thumping)

1440
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:19,733
- My balls!

1441
01:09:21,597 --> 01:09:22,430
My balls!

1442
01:09:23,755 --> 01:09:24,900
- He's just a machine.

1443
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:25,950
- No, he's my friend.

1444
01:09:27,275 --> 01:09:31,452
(thumping)
(men grunting)

1445
01:09:31,452 --> 01:09:32,535
- [Astor] Hm.

1446
01:09:36,370 --> 01:09:38,780
- You're the first man
who's ever touched my balls.

1447
01:09:38,780 --> 01:09:40,990
- Oh gee, lucky me.

1448
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:42,210
- Good job, punk.

1449
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:44,680
- Stop calling me punk, ya thug.

1450
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:46,342
- Let's go.
- Houston!

1451
01:09:46,342 --> 01:09:48,421
- Fall in!
- Let's go, get out.

1452
01:09:48,421 --> 01:09:50,504
(gun firing)

1453
01:09:50,504 --> 01:09:52,992
(shouting drowned out by dramatic music)

1454
01:09:52,992 --> 01:09:54,659
- Let's go, come on.

1455
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:58,346
(banging)

1456
01:09:58,346 --> 01:09:59,179
Let's go.

1457
01:10:00,341 --> 01:10:02,091
Come on, we gotta go.

1458
01:10:04,221 --> 01:10:06,388
(panting)

1459
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:15,013
(electric humming)

1460
01:10:15,013 --> 01:10:16,700
- They can't get through.

1461
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:18,810
- Right, I forgot about the force field.

1462
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:19,730
- What's this?

1463
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:21,010
- Stop, you're gonna hurt yourself.

1464
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:22,850
You've got a control chip in your neck.

1465
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:23,683
- What are you talking about?

1466
01:10:23,683 --> 01:10:26,540
- It's a device to keep
you inside the park.

1467
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:29,430
(banging)
(shouting)

1468
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:31,330
Isn't there anything you can do?

1469
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:33,390
- I could remove the magnetic safety chip.

1470
01:10:33,390 --> 01:10:34,320
That--
- Do it.

1471
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,030
- Freeze.

1472
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:39,610
You're not scalping me.
- I'm not scalping you.

1473
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:41,560
The chip's in your neck.

1474
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,090
I just have to cut your throat.

1475
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:45,479
- Quit your whining.

1476
01:10:45,479 --> 01:10:48,860
(banging)
(grunting)

1477
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,840
Go ahead, sister.

1478
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,763
Let's show the lug how it's done.

1479
01:10:59,052 --> 01:11:01,780
- [Garland] Removing the
control chip was a gamble.

1480
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:04,500
No chip meant the outsider
could get out of the park,

1481
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,780
but his strength would be diminished

1482
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:07,670
and I had no idea what other functions

1483
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:09,320
would be affected.

1484
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,879
It was a risk we had to take.

1485
01:11:11,879 --> 01:11:14,629
(dramatic music)

1486
01:11:21,826 --> 01:11:23,543
(banging)

1487
01:11:23,543 --> 01:11:24,563
- (grunts) Damn it!

1488
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:31,746
- Good, go, go.

1489
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:33,449
(banging)

1490
01:11:33,449 --> 01:11:34,897
Go, go, go.

1491
01:11:34,897 --> 01:11:35,839
Go, go, go!

1492
01:11:35,839 --> 01:11:37,929
(gun firing)

1493
01:11:37,929 --> 01:11:38,762
- Hey!

1494
01:11:40,089 --> 01:11:41,823
- Lita, we gotta jam the door.

1495
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:44,403
Good, let's go.

1496
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:47,140
Come on, I'll take you
on the grand tour later.

1497
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:47,973
Let's go.

1498
01:11:47,973 --> 01:11:49,930
- So this is where I come from?

1499
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:53,453
- Welcome to Gangster World,
where everything is real.

1500
01:11:56,836 --> 01:11:58,992
- [Houston] Garland, open this door!

1501
01:11:58,992 --> 01:12:00,267
Don't you trust me?

1502
01:12:00,267 --> 01:12:01,820
- We really gotta go, come on.

1503
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:02,923
I'll show you everything.

1504
01:12:03,978 --> 01:12:06,160
(banging)

1505
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,950
- [Kingpin] Houston, you
h-have failed me again.

1506
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:09,980
- That's not my fault.

1507
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:12,700
It's your damn RCUs, they're morons.

1508
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:14,630
- [Kingpin] No excuses.

1509
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:17,360
I don't know why I feel
so charitable towards you.

1510
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:18,743
- What?
- Silence.

1511
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:22,010
Call Greenstreet.

1512
01:12:22,010 --> 01:12:23,303
Repeat what I tell you.

1513
01:12:25,367 --> 01:12:26,483
- [Houston] Dr. Greenstreet.

1514
01:12:26,483 --> 01:12:27,560
Dr. Greenstreet, can you hear me?

1515
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,860
- Houston, thank God.

1516
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:30,280
What is going on?

1517
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:32,720
- I've tracked down the source
of all this madness, Doc.

1518
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,500
Your boy Garland's responsible.

1519
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,330
He's cross wired a bunch of RCUs.

1520
01:12:36,330 --> 01:12:37,350
He's running amok.

1521
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:38,770
He's killed my men.

1522
01:12:38,770 --> 01:12:40,540
- Actually, it all fits.

1523
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:41,560
He's the computer expert.

1524
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,960
He has access to all of
Donald 2000's functions.

1525
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,550
He even screwed up the bipolar chip.

1526
01:12:45,550 --> 01:12:47,540
- The bottom line is, he's on his way.

1527
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,280
He's gonna be there in a few minutes.

1528
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:50,360
- What do I do?

1529
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,220
- Keep him busy, stall
him until I can get there.

1530
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:53,700
Whatever you do, don't let him

1531
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,250
get his hands on that computer.

1532
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,980
- What on earth is that?

1533
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:00,813
- A keepsake.

1534
01:13:01,729 --> 01:13:03,600
(dramatic music)

1535
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,433
Garland.

1536
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:07,860
Don't take another step.

1537
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:08,760
- Now what?

1538
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,130
- Sir?

1539
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:11,930
Sir, what are you doing?

1540
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,300
- Oh, drop the act.

1541
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:15,320
Houston told me what you're up to.

1542
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:18,840
Ooh, are you ever in
a stew now, young man.

1543
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:21,440
And what are these, some
of your reprogrammed RCUs?

1544
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,383
- Houston?

1545
01:13:22,383 --> 01:13:24,510
Houston tried to kill me, sir.

1546
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:26,670
- Garland, why lie?

1547
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:29,540
After all this, it seems so petty.

1548
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:31,490
- I didn't do this, but I know who did.

1549
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:33,543
Donald 2000.

1550
01:13:34,616 --> 01:13:36,090
(beeping)

1551
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:37,170
- The computer?

1552
01:13:37,170 --> 01:13:39,910
Do you expect me to swallow that?

1553
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:41,010
- Think.

1554
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:43,630
Who else has complete control of the RCUs?

1555
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:45,810
Complete knowledge of the game areas.

1556
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:49,810
Who else could create
someone like the outsider?

1557
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:51,580
The Donald knows its gonna be replaced

1558
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:53,610
and he's trying to stop us.

1559
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:56,880
He wants me dead because I am the only one

1560
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,910
who can put the new 3000 system online.

1561
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:01,770
When I escaped the outsider,

1562
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,160
the Donald had its RCUs kidnap Lita

1563
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,290
to lure me back into the park.

1564
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:08,300
Then, under the guise of Kingpin,

1565
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:10,444
it kept her from me as bait

1566
01:14:10,444 --> 01:14:13,323
and then had its robots try to kill me.

1567
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:15,750
Sir, don't you see?

1568
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:18,170
If you don't let me in the computer room

1569
01:14:18,170 --> 01:14:21,433
the Donald is capable of
overcharging its systems.

1570
01:14:22,490 --> 01:14:25,601
It can unbalance the hydrogen tanks

1571
01:14:25,601 --> 01:14:27,530
in the liquidation center

1572
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:30,469
and blow up the entire park, sir.

1573
01:14:30,469 --> 01:14:33,219
(ominous music)

1574
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,450
It's got nothing to lose.

1575
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:43,303
Sir, it will destroy
the park and us with it.

1576
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:49,163
Now choose.

1577
01:14:51,883 --> 01:14:54,050
(beeping)

1578
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:58,500
- Well, this is just great.

1579
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,880
This is great.

1580
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:00,730
Now what do I do?

1581
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,140
What would you do?

1582
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:02,973
- Sir.

1583
01:15:02,973 --> 01:15:03,806
- Garland.

1584
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:07,703
- Sir.

1585
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,570
Do you think I really wanna blow up, too?

1586
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:14,940
- All right, suit up.

1587
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:16,280
But I'll be watching you from the door

1588
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,080
and if you try anything funny, I'll,

1589
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:20,530
I'll shoot off your extremities.

1590
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:29,949
(dramatic music)

1591
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:37,880
- Sir, look at yourself.

1592
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,740
You have got a gun in your hand

1593
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:41,960
and you just threatened to shoot a person.

1594
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,390
Didn't you always say that violence

1595
01:15:43,390 --> 01:15:44,883
is never justified?

1596
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:49,870
- So I'm a hypocrite.

1597
01:15:49,870 --> 01:15:52,070
- So this, this place, this park

1598
01:15:52,070 --> 01:15:53,870
that was supposed to cure such tendencies,

1599
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:55,143
what, it's all a sham?

1600
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:58,183
- Claire, you're just
too young to understand.

1601
01:15:58,183 --> 01:16:01,503
Now why don't you just
sit down and be quiet.

1602
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:05,143
- Dr. Greenstreet?

1603
01:16:06,011 --> 01:16:06,844
- What?

1604
01:16:06,844 --> 01:16:08,834
- Quit telling me what to do.

1605
01:16:08,834 --> 01:16:10,740
(whacking)
(thuds)

1606
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:11,863
- Nice shot!

1607
01:16:14,299 --> 01:16:16,463
Now let's find Houston.

1608
01:16:16,463 --> 01:16:19,213
(dramatic music)

1609
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:30,124
- Astor?

1610
01:16:31,124 --> 01:16:33,707
(soft chiming)

1611
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:38,637
(beeping)

1612
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:46,559
Astor.

1613
01:16:48,792 --> 01:16:49,625
Astor!

1614
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:53,040
You okay?

1615
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:53,873
- Fine.

1616
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,620
(beeping)

1617
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:59,020
I just remembered something.

1618
01:17:03,480 --> 01:17:04,313
- Stop!

1619
01:17:04,313 --> 01:17:05,968
(Claire shrieks)
(gun firing)

1620
01:17:05,968 --> 01:17:07,037
- No!

1621
01:17:07,037 --> 01:17:07,870
No!

1622
01:17:08,784 --> 01:17:11,367
(somber music)

1623
01:17:12,830 --> 01:17:14,120
How could you?

1624
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,563
- It's a cold, hard world, kid.

1625
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:20,013
You should know, you made it.

1626
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:24,268
- You're working for Donald.

1627
01:17:24,268 --> 01:17:26,720
You're his last line of defense.

1628
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:29,580
- Now isn't that just like a man.

1629
01:17:29,580 --> 01:17:30,990
Slow, for the most part,

1630
01:17:30,990 --> 01:17:33,990
but occasionally they have their moments.

1631
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:35,500
- He cared for you.

1632
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:40,870
- Don't be silly.

1633
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:43,177
- Silly, look at him.

1634
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:46,523
Look at him!

1635
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:52,200
He took a bullet for you.

1636
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:56,613
- Shut your trap!

1637
01:17:57,530 --> 01:18:00,302
He's dead and now so are you.

1638
01:18:00,302 --> 01:18:03,840
(whacking)
(gun clatters)

1639
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,183
- Astor, Astor.

1640
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:11,463
- Big boy.

1641
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:13,830
- You okay?

1642
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:14,663
- Sure.

1643
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:16,723
- You're alive.

1644
01:18:18,306 --> 01:18:19,139
But how?

1645
01:18:23,225 --> 01:18:24,970
(laughs)

1646
01:18:24,970 --> 01:18:26,470
- Don't you have a toy to fix?

1647
01:18:28,895 --> 01:18:31,378
(ominous music)

1648
01:18:31,378 --> 01:18:33,493
(rumbling)

1649
01:18:33,493 --> 01:18:35,770
(objects shattering)

1650
01:18:35,770 --> 01:18:40,437
(shrieking)
(shouting)

1651
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:44,120
- He did it, he did it.

1652
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,780
He triggered the hydrogen.

1653
01:18:45,780 --> 01:18:47,963
He triggered the hydrogen,
I knew he could do it!

1654
01:18:49,058 --> 01:18:51,308
(bubbling)

1655
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,760
Lita, there's not much time.

1656
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:56,593
I might not...

1657
01:19:00,084 --> 01:19:01,084
- Good luck.

1658
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:05,610
(dramatic music)

1659
01:19:05,610 --> 01:19:07,777
(beeping)

1660
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,363
- [Kingpin] Hello, Garland.

1661
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,270
- Hello, Donald.

1662
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:38,320
Or should I call you Kingpin?

1663
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:39,740
- [Kingpin] You think you've won

1664
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:42,590
but even if you replace
me, Garland, it's too late.

1665
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:45,080
The chain reaction I've
begun in the hydrogen tanks

1666
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,590
is unstoppable.

1667
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:48,200
You want to save the park,

1668
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,453
you want to save your friends,
but it's all too late.

1669
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:55,289
(lock clicking)

1670
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:01,340
I've disabled the door and
now you're trapped with me.

1671
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,713
We'll die together.

1672
01:20:06,062 --> 01:20:08,895
(Garland panting)

1673
01:20:17,437 --> 01:20:18,270
- Houston!

1674
01:20:19,428 --> 01:20:21,354
(gun firing)

1675
01:20:21,354 --> 01:20:23,639
(shouting)
(whacking)

1676
01:20:23,639 --> 01:20:25,889
(grunting)

1677
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:32,193
(Lita shrieking)

1678
01:20:32,193 --> 01:20:33,860
- [Houston] Damn it!

1679
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:44,968
(Lita screams)
(thwacking)

1680
01:20:50,357 --> 01:20:51,569
(Houston screams)

1681
01:20:51,569 --> 01:20:53,819
(crashing)

1682
01:21:03,468 --> 01:21:05,718
(whacking)

1683
01:21:07,078 --> 01:21:08,550
- [Garland] The clock was ticking down

1684
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:09,940
and I was trying to beat the odds

1685
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:11,730
when it suddenly hit me.

1686
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:14,720
I had played right into Kingpin's hands.

1687
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,890
The Donald 2000 had played me
like a fool from the start.

1688
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:20,080
There I was trying to save
the central memory chip

1689
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,620
from blowing the park to pieces,

1690
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:24,390
when all along that's
exactly what he wanted.

1691
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:27,160
Talk about the perfect
crime, the perfect getaway.

1692
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,550
In that microsecond
before the park blew up,

1693
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:31,240
Donald planned to download himself

1694
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,490
into another Gangster World.

1695
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:38,160
Cyber Darwinism, a basic
survival of the cyber fittest

1696
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:41,020
and it would work unless I destroyed

1697
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:43,550
his central memory chip
before the park went up.

1698
01:21:43,550 --> 01:21:45,913
- [Kingpin] Garland, what are you doing?

1699
01:21:45,913 --> 01:21:46,746
Garland.

1700
01:21:46,746 --> 01:21:47,944
(Garland grunting)

1701
01:21:47,944 --> 01:21:49,480
My memory chip.

1702
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:50,329
No!

1703
01:21:50,329 --> 01:21:54,859
(crashing)
(garbled speech)

1704
01:21:54,859 --> 01:21:56,877
(Houston shrieking)

1705
01:21:56,877 --> 01:21:58,614
(beeping)

1706
01:21:58,614 --> 01:22:00,864
(whacking)

1707
01:22:02,199 --> 01:22:03,901
- Get me out!

1708
01:22:03,901 --> 01:22:06,651
(dramatic music)

1709
01:22:09,993 --> 01:22:12,910
(glass shattering)

1710
01:22:14,444 --> 01:22:16,694
Lita, Lita, we've gotta go.

1711
01:22:19,316 --> 01:22:22,983
Oh, come on everybody,
we gotta get out now.

1712
01:22:24,542 --> 01:22:27,693
(Houston shouting)

1713
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:28,831
- Go with him.

1714
01:22:28,831 --> 01:22:29,696
- Make me.

1715
01:22:29,696 --> 01:22:31,946
(whacking)

1716
01:22:33,354 --> 01:22:35,513
- Cruelty, don't you just love it?

1717
01:22:36,496 --> 01:22:38,383
- Come on, it's gonna blow.

1718
01:22:38,383 --> 01:22:39,607
- Here at Gangster World,

1719
01:22:39,607 --> 01:22:42,084
you're free to express
your darkest desires.

1720
01:22:42,084 --> 01:22:44,200
(beeping)

1721
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:46,430
(whacking)

1722
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:48,679
(Lita whimpers)

1723
01:22:48,679 --> 01:22:53,262
(screaming)
(sizzling)

1724
01:22:55,575 --> 01:22:57,742
(booming)

1725
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:06,273
Welcome to Gangster World.

1726
01:23:06,273 --> 01:23:08,440
Welcome to Gangster World.

1727
01:23:12,434 --> 01:23:14,810
(booming)

1728
01:23:14,810 --> 01:23:16,727
Don't you just love it?

1729
01:23:17,921 --> 01:23:20,088
(booming)

1730
01:23:23,594 --> 01:23:25,427
- [Lita] Oh, look out!

1731
01:23:30,419 --> 01:23:33,590
(interposing voices shouting)

1732
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:35,330
- Dr. Greenstreet thought violence

1733
01:23:35,330 --> 01:23:37,180
could be contained in Gangster World,

1734
01:23:38,490 --> 01:23:41,330
but violence is part of human nature.

1735
01:23:41,330 --> 01:23:43,280
You can't bottle it up.

1736
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:46,143
In time, the bottle breaks
and violence spills out.

1737
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:52,190
The outsider, he became human

1738
01:23:53,347 --> 01:23:55,923
because he learned noble emotions,

1739
01:23:57,350 --> 01:24:01,543
love, friendship, self-sacrifice,

1740
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:04,503
courage.

1741
01:24:05,868 --> 01:24:06,701
He taught me.

1742
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:10,800
He taught me how to be human.

1743
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:15,900
- [Detective] Dr. Widmark, are you sure

1744
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:18,409
those two RCUs were destroyed?

1745
01:24:18,409 --> 01:24:21,120
(heart beating)
(monitor beeping)

1746
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,534
- Yeah.

1747
01:24:22,534 --> 01:24:25,040
- [Detective] Was there any
other way out of the park?

1748
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,990
Could either one of them have survived?

1749
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:32,603
- No.

1750
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,443
No, I'm sure of it.

1751
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:43,343
Absolutely not.

1752
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:47,540
I knew that everything I
said, every little word,

1753
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:49,410
every little gesture was being monitored

1754
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:50,540
by a lie detector

1755
01:24:50,540 --> 01:24:53,237
so I tried hard to concentrate
only on what I saw,

1756
01:24:53,237 --> 01:24:55,270
not on what I hoped as I recalled

1757
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:57,523
taking my last look at Gangster World.

1758
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:01,463
- I know.

1759
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:04,313
I'll miss them, too.

1760
01:25:06,645 --> 01:25:09,720
(objects shattering)

1761
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:12,303
(somber music)

1762
01:25:22,172 --> 01:25:24,755
(heroic music)

1763
01:25:30,032 --> 01:25:33,718
- Mm, I told ya I was
good in a tight squeeze.

1764
01:25:33,718 --> 01:25:36,540
(saucy music)

1765
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:39,593
Oh, I see definite potential here.

1766
01:25:41,590 --> 01:25:45,037
What do you say, big boy, goin' my way?

1767
01:25:54,765 --> 01:25:57,932
(lively, saucy music)

1768
01:26:36,177 --> 01:26:39,260
(lighthearted music)

1769
01:27:30,374 --> 01:27:33,207
(dramatic music)
