00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,347
And speaking of President Obama,

3
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,587
I think we ought to pay
tribute to him today

4
00:00:27,627 --> 00:00:29,356
on this Tax Day Tea Party

5
00:00:29,396 --> 00:00:32,263
because really he's
the inspiration

6
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:35,267
forwhy it is we're here today.

7
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:36,962
That's right.
The Tea Party movement

8
00:00:37,003 --> 00:00:39,938
wouldn't exist
without Barack Obama.

9
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:43,007
Madison,

10
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,206
when the history of this
Tea Party movement is written,

11
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:51,013
what you accomplished here
will not be forgotten.

12
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,986
God has shed His
grace on thee, America.

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,989
We will not squander
what we have.

14
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:59,719
We will fight for America!

15
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,196
And it starts here in
Madison, Wisconsin!

16
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,221
It starts here!

17
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,029
It starts now!

18
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,866
Mr. President, game on!

19
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:30,382
[CROWD CHANTING]
Yes we can! Yes we can!

20
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,659
- Congratulations, Mr. President.
- Thank you, sir.

21
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:42,429
Mr. President,
I want to believe,

22
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,401
I want to trust.

23
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,926
I want to hope for change,

24
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:49,067
but I am really failing to see
how this is any different.

25
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,406
He's not going to succeed.

26
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,070
We have to bend
over, grab the angles,

27
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,774
bend over forward,
backward, whichever

28
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:55,940
because his father was black

29
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:57,745
because this is the
first black president.

30
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:01,117
Not a single Republican joined
the majority Democrats tonight.

31
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,588
- Honeymoon is over.
- Is it done?

32
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,557
There's a lot of
wife beating going on.

33
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,220
Is President Obama's handling
of the troubled economy

34
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:12,220
a signal that we are
creeping towards socialism?

35
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,625
They got czars in
the White House.

36
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,365
Joseph Stalin
without the bloodshed.

37
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,737
Communist, the Marxist,
they're taking over.

[CROWD CHANTING]
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

39
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:28,608
Today is the beginning of
the grassroots movements

40
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,582
to take back this country.

41
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,278
My brother, Charles and I

42
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:38,120
provided the funds to start the
Americans for Prosperity.

43
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:43,790
And it's beyond my wildest
dreams how AFP has grown.

44
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,732
The largest tax day
tea party in the nation.

45
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,291
You can join the
tea party action

The Democrats call
those folks a mob,

49
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:02,638
crazy, even worse,
I call them patriots.

50
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,343
I agree.

51
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,852
It's about patriotism.

52
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,181
He's not a natural born citizen.

53
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:11,622
He's surrounding himself
with people of his own kind.

54
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,786
This president, I think,
has a deep-seated hatred

55
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:16,522
for white people.

56
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,457
Thanks to millions of Americans
who stepped up in town halls

57
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,437
and tea parties
across this country.

58
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:27,871
He is not going to get his way.

59
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,169
He brought a gun to a meeting

60
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,767
the president held today
on healthcare.

61
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,368
Was your gun loaded today?

Ah, wow,

00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,438
who would be silly enough to
carry an unloaded firearm?

taking our nation back.

God save the United States
and this honorable court.

You'll hear re-argument this
morning in Citizens United

75
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,027
versus the Federal
Election Commission.

77
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,631
Mr. Chief Justice and
may it please the court.

78
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,469
For over a hundred years,
Congress has made a judgment

79
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,374
that corporations must be
subject to special rules

80
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,469
when they participate
in elections

81
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,310
and this court has never
questioned that judgment.

82
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:43,542
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

83
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,211
We never questioned it,
but we never approved it either.

84
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,854
The Citizens United case arose

85
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:54,019
out of a movie made
a right wing group

86
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,053
Citizens United partially
funded by corporate donations

87
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,497
denouncing Hillary Clinton.

88
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:02,558
It was made at a time
when she was viewed

89
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,537
as the leading Democratic
candidate for president.

90
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:08,404
Ruthless, vindictive.

91
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:10,875
Venal, sneaky.

92
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,505
Ideological, intolerant.

93
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:16,174
Liar is a good one.

94
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:17,910
Scares the hell out of me.

95
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,778
I think anybody watching that
movie would walk away

96
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,721
with the clear impression

97
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,781
that the moviemakers
were trying to urge you

98
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,258
not to vote for her.

99
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:29,056
If you thought you
knew everything

100
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,790
about Hillary Clinton,

101
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,730
wait until you see
the movie.

102
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,798
They called it
Hillary The Movie

103
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,234
to ensure that their
advertisements

104
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,637
would have to name
a federal candidate.

105
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,801
Congress said, if you are
running an ad about a candidate

106
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,276
and you're close
to the election,

107
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,245
you can't have
corporate funding,

108
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,804
you can't have union funding

109
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,715
and you have to list the
donors behind those ads.

110
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,981
This provides the voters
with important information

111
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,784
that they are entitled to know
about before the election.

112
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,484
Would it expedite the
visibility of this movie

113
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:02,494
if you were to simply
comply with the disclosure

114
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,893
and disclaimer law?

115
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,421
Well, we would suffer damage
if we did that.

116
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,956
We would not get contributors

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,434
who want to contribute
to the film,

118
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,995
to contribute to the
advertising of the film.

119
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,839
If we agree to
disclosing our donors.

120
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,846
Have you actually gotten an
expressed concern from donors

121
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,507
or it's just kind of a
theoretical principal

122
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,412
that you're standing on?

123
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,349
No, we have expressed concerns.

124
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,149
Jim Bopp has been
bringing test cases

125
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,621
of trying to push
the law back

126
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,318
and have less regulation.

127
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:37,989
You cannot even buy a Democrat
congressman for $2500.

128
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,262
The anecdotal evidence
is that it takes $99,000

129
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,996
in cold hard cash.

130
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,771
He decided that there was an
opportunity with Citizens United

131
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,798
to challenge the requirement

132
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:53,141
that the sources of funding
of a film like that

133
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,545
that advocated
the election or defeat

134
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,378
of a federal candidate

135
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,978
had to be reported to the
Federal Election Commission.

136
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,114
The case went to the
Supreme Court

137
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,991
and there were five
justices ready to say,

138
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:09,824
this isn't the disclosure case,

139
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,990
this is really about whether
corporate money can be spent,

140
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:17,469
we think that there
is nothing wrong

141
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,198
with spending corporate money

142
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:21,968
to advocate the elect defeat
of a candidate.

143
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:24,499
And the four justices
in the minority said,

144
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:27,911
"Wait a minute, that hasn't
even been briefed in this case."

145
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:31,506
The court said, we want you
to re-argue this case

146
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,916
and argue it bigger.

147
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,681
So that was a bit surprising...

148
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,153
It was very surprising.

149
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,521
It's a very unusual thing
for the court to do

150
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:42,050
and it's very activist.

151
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:43,857
Hillary The Movie
never made it to theaters,

152
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,386
but it's getting a
showing this week

153
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:47,194
in front of the United States
Supreme Court.

154
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,325
Here is the issue.

155
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,858
Is it legal to restrict
corporate spending

156
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,803
on political campaigns?

157
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,204
Mr. Olson.

158
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,403
Mr. Chief Justice and
may it please the court.

159
00:07:57,443 --> 00:08:01,539
Robust debate about candidates
for elective office

160
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,640
is the most fundamental
value

161
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,083
protected by the First
Amendment's guarantee

162
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,211
of free speech.

163
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,882
Yet that is precisely
the dialogue

164
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:12,914
that the government
has prohibited

165
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,826
if practiced by unions
or corporations.

166
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,160
Mr. Olson, are you
taking the position

167
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:21,655
that there is no difference
in the First Amendment Rights

168
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,828
of an individual?

169
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,671
A corporation after all is
not endowed by its creator

170
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,404
with an inalienable rights.

171
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,374
I had attended the oral
argument with Senator McCain,

172
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,677
we sat together
and watched it,

173
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,776
and we were very concerned.

174
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:43,277
There are certain judges
who are alleging that somehow

175
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:47,418
corporations have the
same rights as citizens.

176
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,360
I don't accept that premise.

177
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,524
In Citizens United
versus the FEC,

178
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,195
Justice Kennedy has the
opinion of the court.

179
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:59,761
First Amendment protection
extends to corporations.

180
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,103
Political speech is
indispensable to decision making

181
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:04,268
in a democracy
and this is no less true

182
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,107
because the speech
comes from a corporation

183
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,238
rather than an individual.

184
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,613
Senator McConnell leaned over
to me once or twice

185
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,587
and said that, is this... is
this a very broad opinion,

186
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:18,988
and I said it's about
as broad as it could be.

187
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,152
The Supreme Court
is supposed to give

188
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:24,287
the narrowest possible ruling
to resolve the question.

189
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,322
Instead, the court
just went off the charts.

190
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,265
I was standing
outside the court,

191
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,565
I was really shocked.

192
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:34,437
I was shocked at the
arrogance of the court,

193
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,738
I was shocked at the fact
that they thought

194
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,802
corporations were people.

195
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,076
The court said that as long
as it's independent spending,

196
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,912
it can't be corrupting.

197
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,418
Give the money directly
to the candidate,

198
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:50,445
you can't give more
than $2500 per election.

199
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,458
Give the money to this
Super PAC out there

200
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,926
that is advancing the goals
of the same candidate

201
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,021
and you can give an
unlimited amount of money

202
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,862
and some folks are
giving millions.

203
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,993
It was a huge power grab
by corporate America,

204
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,127
they succeeded,

205
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,832
and sadly the Supreme Court
was a tool for their interest

206
00:10:06,872 --> 00:10:09,534
instead of being the guardian
of our constitution,

207
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,270
the guardian of our laws.

208
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,846
The chief justice and
the associate justices

209
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,871
of the Supreme Court.

210
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,185
The president of
the United States.

211
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,313
Thank you very much.

212
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:26,985
With all due deference
to separation of powers,

213
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,790
last week the Supreme Court
reversed a century of law

214
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,662
that I believe will open
the floodgates

215
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:34,188
for special interest

216
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,497
including foreign corporations

217
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:39,333
to spend without limit
in our elections.

218
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,712
I don't think American elections
should be bankrolled

219
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:51,513
by America's most
powerful interests.

220
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:56,214
I would like you to do
something different,

221
00:10:56,255 --> 00:10:58,883
I would like you
to bring a check,

222
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:04,988
but not $35,800
on Wall Street,

223
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:08,091
60 bucks

224
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:11,069
and have your neighbor do that

225
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:13,264
and have a
million people do that.

226
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,739
And then five million do that

227
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,403
and then guess who
runs the country,

228
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,139
the people do.

229
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,670
I thought that's what
the constitution said.

230
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:23,579
I thought that's what the

231
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,743
declaration of
independence said.

232
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:27,980
Well, let me repeat
what it says,

233
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,081
it says we will not
stand the tyranny of a king.

234
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,751
We will not live in a country

235
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,023
where there are
classes of people,

236
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:39,589
the very rich
and the very poor.

237
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,930
What has America become?

238
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,742
This is my woman,
I claimed her

239
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:56,009
and I've got an
invitation for her

240
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,415
marked with a T
for Tea Party.

241
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:03,286
You might her as the wife
of the Clarence Thomas.

242
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,846
Whoa!

243
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,223
November 2nd will be a
storm in Washington.

244
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,752
We are going to come after
you so hard you have no idea.

245
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:17,099
Two years from now Barrack
Obama is a one term president.

246
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,263
* *

247
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,377
If you've maxed out to
the senate committee,

248
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,318
congressional committee or the
RNC and you'd like to do more

249
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,048
under the Citizens
United decision,

250
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,421
you can give money to the
American Crossroads 527

251
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,255
or Crossroads GPS.

252
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,885
American Crossroads
is responsible.

253
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,419
Club for Groth Action is
responsible for the content.

254
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,728
Americans for Prosperity is
responsible for the content

255
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,791
of this advertising.

256
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:51,894
More than three and a half
billion dollars has been spent

257
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,566
making this midterm election
the most expensive on record.

258
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,672
The Republican Governor's
Association

259
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,978
is targeting swing states
like Michigan

260
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,007
and Wisconsin and Florida.

261
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:07,951
Let me tell you how
excited Republicans

262
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:11,115
across the country are
about Scott Walker

263
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,125
and what y'all are doing
here in Wisconsin.

264
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,289
In 201 0, Wisconsin is
going to experience

265
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:20,492
the greatest political
tsunami in the country.

266
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,194
You are going to lead the way.

267
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:25,692
We can take our government
back and take it back we will.

268
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:27,330
The whole new class of
Republican Governors

269
00:13:27,373 --> 00:13:29,671
in critical presidential
battleground states.

270
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,369
For the Republican,
Scott Walker,

271
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,675
there is a big gain here
now for Republicans

272
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:37,147
in the Governor's race
in Wisconsin.

273
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,451
Tonight I want to tell...

274
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,114
Tonight, I want to tell
every worker,

275
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,214
every family
and every business

276
00:13:45,257 --> 00:13:47,316
big or small in the state

277
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,157
that you have an ally
in the Governor's office,

278
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:53,996
Wisconsin is open for business.

279
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,360
Wisconsin is a good example

280
00:13:57,403 --> 00:14:01,305
where the people were
overpowered by money.

281
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,968
Two brothers,
Charles and David Koch

282
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,968
were the largest donors to
Governor Walker's campaign.

283
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:14,008
KochPAC gave $43,000
to Scott Walker

284
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,987
to help him get
elected Governor.

285
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,821
But they didn't stop by maxing
out on a direct contribution

286
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,349
to Scott Walker,

287
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,657
they then gave the Republican
Governors Association

288
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,220
a million dollars.

289
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:28,529
And the RGA spent 5 million
dollars on advertising

290
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,262
supporting Walker's election.

291
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,770
Well, that was an incredibly
important investment

292
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:35,569
that may well have put
Walker over the hump.

293
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,675
It didn't come out until
after the election

294
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,509
that Koch Industries
had played the role

295
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,710
in bankrolling Scott Walker's
candidacy.

296
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,241
Wisconsin used to have some
of the best disclosure laws

297
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,617
in the country,

298
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,747
some of the strongest
campaign finance laws

299
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:52,450
you would find
anywhere in America.

300
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:54,584
And now those laws are
basically not worth

301
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,992
the paper they're written on.

302
00:14:56,028 --> 00:15:00,692
That's the largely unknown
consequence of Citizens United,

303
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,169
is that it is unleashed money
that our disclosure laws

304
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:06,398
are not equipped to reveal.

305
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,202
The point of it is to find a
way to spend money in elections

306
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:12,836
nowadays without
telling anyone who you are.

307
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,709
And why would you
want to do that?

308
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,840
Well, that's a good question.

309
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:21,012
It maybe that you just
like operating

310
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:23,419
under the radar as they say.

311
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:26,856
It maybe that you have
somewhat nefarious motives.

312
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:33,088
Allowing corporations to spend
money on elections

313
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:35,362
will always keep it
a freer country,

314
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,700
but it need not always
benefit the country.

315
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:42,195
It may lead to very bad people
being elected sometime

316
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:45,142
and it may lead to
too much power.

317
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,079
On the Supreme Court,
we seen an individual

318
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:58,249
such as Chief Justice
John G. Roberts, Jr.

319
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,258
who conducted himself
brilliantly before the

320
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,658
Senate Judiciary Committee

321
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,425
and soon Chief Justice Roberts

322
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,729
will have as his colleague
Judge Samuel Alito Jr.

323
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,727
In Citizens United, we thought
we had a very good argument.

324
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,740
The problem was we didn't have a
good audience for our argument.

325
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,902
One justice retired and
with that one switch,

326
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:22,107
what had been a 5-4 majority
on the court

327
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,581
that was willing to uphold
campaign finance laws

328
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,607
switch to a 5-4 majority

329
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,917
to strike down
campaign finance laws.

330
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,946
Nothing else in the world
had really changed.

331
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,289
No,
I mean nothing had changed,

332
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,452
never mind really changed.

333
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,121
That's one of the things
that Justice Stevens said

334
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,129
on his descent.

335
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,927
You know, we don't
overrule precedence

336
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:43,457
unless something has
significantly changed.

337
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,665
And the only thing Steven said
that I can see that has changed

338
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:49,469
is one justice on the
court has retired

339
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,634
and had been replaced
by somebody

340
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,507
who views it differently.

341
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,543
The Supreme Court

342
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:02,111
in front a statue eternally
contemplates justice

343
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:05,180
and inside
nine men dispense it.

344
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,021
When they were in
elementary school,

345
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:08,526
we learned that the
Supreme Court

346
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,222
was the highest court
in the land.

347
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,566
Well, I discovered in the last
year is that the Supreme Court,

348
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,694
the highest court in the land

349
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:21,228
has the lowest
ethical standards.

350
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,400
Justice Scalia and Thomas

351
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,501
actually had a
conflict of interest

352
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,307
on the Citizens United case.

353
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,644
Justice Thomas had
violated the rules

354
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,149
by not filing his
financial forms

355
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,982
and in voting for
Citizens United

356
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,148
gave his wife the opportunity
to receive a large gift

357
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,717
from a corporation
to spend politically

358
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,318
which she could not have done

359
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,159
before Citizens
United has passed.

360
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,427
Hello patriots!

361
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,058
Whoa!

362
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:54,094
She then spent that on
ultraconservative candidates

363
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,198
that she supported.

364
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,769
Justice Scalia appeared before
the Tea Party on Capitol Hill.

365
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,339
We were delighted
with Justice Scalia...

366
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,045
If they were under the
judicial code of ethics,

367
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,577
they would not be permitted
to go to any political party

368
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,953
or make any contribution
to political parties.

369
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:15,391
If the liberal Special interest Groups
and their allies on Capitol Hill

370
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,622
want to have a battle,
we're ready to go.

371
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,434
So with that,
we'll show you the spot.

372
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,736
When President Bush
nominated Clarence Thomas,

373
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,742
he choose a man
who grow up poor

374
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,607
in a one-room dirt floor shack,

375
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,078
but with strong grandparents,
a good education,

376
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,548
and his own hard work,
Clarence Thomas made it

377
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,017
and his conservative
values show it.

378
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,247
But Thomas faces
bitter opposition

379
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,948
from liberal senate Democrats

380
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,355
whose value should be
on the Supreme Court,

381
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:49,451
Clarence Thomas'
or Ted Kennedy's.

382
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,053
Call today.

383
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,796
President Bush and
Clarence Thomas need your help.

384
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,205
We're here in Rancho Mirage

385
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,980
to report on this conservative
fundraiser that's going on.

386
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:17,079
It's a fundraiser/political
strategy session

387
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,386
with some of the wealthiest
businessman in the country

388
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,289
to fund the
conservative movement.

389
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,059
For 1 0 years, the Koch brothers
and their friends

390
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,660
have been meeting twice a year

391
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:35,400
at resorts in California
and in Colorado.

392
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,907
They're inviting all of the
conservative legislators

393
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,074
from the House and Senate.

394
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,778
They even invited Justices
Scalia and Thomas

395
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,911
to speak to their meetings.

396
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,097
They're extraordinarily wealthy.

397
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,428
They have fertilizer plants.

398
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,626
One of the largest timber
companies in the world,

399
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,260
a large network of pipelines,

400
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,294
shipping fossil fuels
around the country.

401
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,033
The refineries that
specialize in

402
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:09,540
some of the worst types of oil

403
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:12,009
like Canadian crude oil
that's high carbon

404
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,807
very bad for the environment.

405
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,448
Last year, when they had this
meeting in Aspen, Colorado,

406
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:20,042
they planned how to
take Congress

407
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:21,985
and raise hundreds
of millions of dollars

408
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,148
plugged it into nonprofits like
Americans for Prosperity,

409
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,387
so the public didn't know
where the money was coming from

410
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:31,624
and we've got a brand new
Congress elected by these guys.

411
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:32,687
Hi sir, my name is Lee Fang.

412
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,993
I'm with the blog
Think Progress...

413
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:35,863
Hey Lee, we're not
doing any interview today,

414
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,833
we're not doing any interview.

415
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,962
What you're expecting
from the new congress?

416
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,905
Well, cut the hell out
of the spending

417
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,704
and balance the budget

418
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,076
and reduce regulations
and support business.

419
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,377
Mr. Koch, are you proud of
the Tea Party Movement

420
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,643
and what they've achieved...?

421
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:54,914
Yeah, like there's
some extremist there,

422
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:58,320
but the rank and file are
just normal people like us.

423
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,722
David, Lee here is a good
blogger on the left.

424
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,058
We're glad to have him.
No more interviews now.

425
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,529
Just a quick interview,

426
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,589
are you proud of what
Americans for Prosperity

427
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,657
has achieved this year?

428
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,361
You bet, I am.
Man oh man.

429
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,232
We're going to do more too

430
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,067
in the next couple of years,
you know.

431
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,769
All together,
global warming is...

432
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:23,042
Bullshit!

433
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:26,073
In January of 2009,
Americans for Prosperity

434
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:30,214
start sending organizers
in California, Arizona, Florida,

435
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,416
several other states
to organize these tea parties

436
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,618
to depose the belief
in climate change

437
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,890
and support key agenda items

438
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,396
that Koch Industries
has an interest in.

439
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:40,898
And we are going to
fight the future,

440
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,229
we are about ready
to launch

441
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:43,928
the right-to-work effort
in Michigan,

442
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:48,372
AFP is here at the right time
for our nation's history.

443
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:56,714
In 201 0, after he's elected
with tremendous support

444
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,581
from Koch Industries
and KochPAC,

445
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:01,745
Scott Walker takes legislation

446
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:05,416
that was written by an
outfit in Washington DC,

447
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:10,588
ALEC funded by the Koch brothers
and other corporate interests.

448
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:14,622
He takes these model bills
from voter ID laws

449
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,566
to a tax on worker rights

450
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,068
and he's made it
his own playbook,

451
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:20,401
and he's put all
that policy in place.

452
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:25,308
That's not something that people
in Wisconsin were yearning for,

453
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,438
it's not something that you
heard a hue and cry about.

454
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,645
This is an agenda
that the less 1% wants.

455
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,118
Good to see.

456
00:22:35,153 --> 00:22:36,313
Thanks for having us.

457
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,481
Thank you.

458
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,454
Good to see you again...

459
00:22:40,125 --> 00:22:42,093
So what we're going to do
and talk about right now,

460
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:45,119
these concerns that Mary and I
have are a little controversial

461
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,324
to bring upstairs,
because there's press up there.

462
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,458
Yeah.
We'll follow.

463
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,731
Any chance we'll ever get to be
a completely red state

464
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,397
- And work on these unions?
- Oh yeah.

465
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:54,905
And become
a right-to-work?

466
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,500
- Well what...
- What can we do to help you?

467
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,169
Well, we're going to start
in a couple of weeks

468
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,473
with our budget
adjustment bill.

469
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:02,070
The first step is...

470
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:04,742
We're going to deal with
collective bargaining

471
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,512
- For all public employee unions.
- Right.

472
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,485
Because you use
divide and conquer.

473
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,581
So I need lawmakers
to vote on it,

474
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:15,957
but the key is by
tying it to the budget,

475
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,962
there's no way to unravel that.

476
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:23,790
Huge changes could be on the
horizon for public employees

477
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:27,771
as the Governor seeks to
strip unions of some rights.

478
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:28,932
We're going to have
to make changes

479
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,168
in terms of collective
bargaining

480
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,334
even question whether
or not you have

481
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,934
a public union to begin with.

482
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:35,845
The change would strip
bargaining rights from everyone

483
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:38,873
from snow plough
drivers to prison guards.

484
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,715
The union actually says about
37% of our membership

485
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,880
voted for Scott Walker.

486
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,789
Everyone knew that he
was not union-friendly,

487
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:50,818
but he never said anything about
attacking collective bargaining.

488
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:55,355
Mid-term elections
went Republican,

489
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,200
Republican and Republican.

490
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:02,229
And I am a Republican.

491
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,744
What I voted for
is not what I got.

492
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,640
I did not vote,

493
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:11,979
and this is a harsh word to use,

494
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:14,247
I did not vote for a dictator

495
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,480
who would strip me

496
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,351
and my colleagues
of all their rights.

497
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,523
The reaction around
school was shock.

498
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:33,060
We didn't know if we were going
to have a job the next day,

499
00:24:33,104 --> 00:24:35,402
the next month,
the next year.

500
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:44,281
It's not just about teachers,
it's about our state's history.

501
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,443
This can't happen.

502
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,385
This is wrong.

503
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,854
For snow plowers that
take care of the roads.

504
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,085
What Walker is trying
to do is unfair

505
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:56,616
without giving us a voice.

506
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,722
The union is losing ground.

507
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:06,533
They lost 61 2,000 union
members in 201 0 alone.

508
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:07,265
Now, think about it,

509
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:10,035
everyone in those
602,000 people had literally,

510
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:12,873
perhaps several hundred
dollars worth of union dues

511
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,641
going into the political
coffers of their union

512
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,908
to spend on politics.

513
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,882
So yeah, you keep having
for half a million people

514
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,885
leave the labor
movement every year

515
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,080
and pretty soon you
start having crimp

516
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:24,713
in the political budget
so these unions

517
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,122
that has a direct effect on
the presidential election.

518
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,925
He was going to change
the world old Walker.

519
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,798
I know people were voting
for him left and right,

520
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:38,928
and so all of a sudden,

521
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,460
have you heard what
that Governor is doing?

522
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,302
If it's just about the budget,

523
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,174
we'll give you the
pension reform,

524
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,738
we'll give you the increase
in our healthcare cost,

525
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:52,409
just don't make it
about our union.

526
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,883
My name is Dee lves

527
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,581
and I'm a veteran of the
United States Air Force.

528
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:02,116
I am also proud to say that I
work at the veteran's home

529
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,424
at King Wisconsin.

530
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:10,161
I am also a Reagan Republican.

531
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:18,669
This bill should not be
about party politics people.

532
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:22,237
[CROWD CHANTING]
Kill this bill! Kill this bill!

533
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:36,590
I am urging all of our
legislators to consider

534
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:40,462
the serious implications
to the quality of care

535
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:44,025
that we will be able to provide
the veterans of Wisconsin

536
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:48,870
in the home that was
established over 1 20 years ago

537
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:51,273
to protect our veterans.

538
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,034
It is 2:50 a.m.

539
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,639
at the Republican members
of the Finance Committee

540
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:59,809
have said that they are
walking out of the hearing.

541
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,648
They're adjourning
it in their words.

542
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:04,314
[CROWD CHANTING]
We will speak! We will speak!

543
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,888
We have not heard of ever
a hearing ending

544
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:13,227
before every person
had the right to speak.

545
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,232
That ended here tonight.

546
00:27:15,266 --> 00:27:18,997
That is a Wisconsin tradition,
we should never allow to end.

547
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,543
In Wisconsin today,
a game of hide and seek.

548
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:31,413
The state legislature
sergeant at arms on the hunt

549
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:34,816
for 14 senate Democrats
who fled the state.

550
00:27:34,853 --> 00:27:35,717
The reason why we left

551
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:38,086
is this was the only
way we could try and get

552
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:40,057
the Governor to
sit down rationally

553
00:27:40,091 --> 00:27:42,685
and talk about this proposal
and talk about changes.

554
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,890
There is on ongoing negotiations

555
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:49,331
with the Senate Democrats
at this point.

556
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,892
They need to come
back and go to work.

557
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,428
The bill is not negotiable.
The bill is not negotiable.

558
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,100
Wisconsin is ground zero.

559
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,339
I think it's going to determine
largely whether or not

560
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:03,711
the pampered nature of
this public employee unions

561
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:06,512
is finally reined in so that
they're paying for healthcare

562
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,178
and they're paying for pensions

563
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,187
in a level that the
private sector is doing.

564
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,950
I think this is the ground zero.

565
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:22,289
I don't have a problem at all
contributing to my pension plan.

566
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,028
In our school district,
we already paid

567
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,435
1 0% of our medical cost,

568
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,269
another 2.5% is nothing.

569
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:30,797
These are both of Will's?

570
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:31,968
- Yeah, those are Will's.
- Fantastic.

571
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,103
Two more student books in.

572
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,272
Yey, hurray another one done.

573
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,812
I don't think any of the
union members have a problem

574
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:43,878
contributing financially to
get in the state out of debt.

575
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:48,450
And I guess, we hoped that
our elected officials

576
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:53,089
would see that we were willing
to meet them halfway.

577
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:59,231
But don't take away my right
to negotiate my paycheck.

578
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,738
That is not what I
voted for you to do.

579
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,682
I've got 21 years in with
the United States Army,

580
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:18,678
came back and choose to
become a correctional officer.

581
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:23,160
As a job that I'm suited for in
terms of my personality

582
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:28,097
and the training that
I got in the military.

583
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:40,104
You can be required to
give more than most jobs.

584
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:44,175
7:20, 1 06.7 FM
Sly in the Morning,

585
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:45,682
correctional officers,

586
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,151
Brian Cummingham and
Mark Elliot with me.

587
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,177
At one time I thought you
guys got to carry guns

588
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:52,121
in those facilities,
you don't,

589
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,284
all you've got is your
walkie-talkie and your brain.

590
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:54,916
That's it.

591
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:59,089
We have 1 233 inmates
that live in a city block.

592
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,098
They all live in their bathroom.

593
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,033
Half of them live with
another man in their bathroom.

594
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:06,593
Everything that those
inmates do on a daily basis

595
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,696
were responsible for.

596
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,970
That's what we do as a service
to the state of Wisconsin

597
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,341
and Scott Walker
has vilified us.

598
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:17,678
He has made us the enemy
when our job is to serve.

599
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:29,350
They're saying they
will agree on the cuts,

600
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,884
but they feel that the request

601
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,829
to eliminate collective
bargaining,

602
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,991
you know, basically
amounts to union busting.

603
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,694
Is there no room for compromise

604
00:30:36,734 --> 00:30:39,225
if they're willing to give on
the financial incentives?

605
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,864
Well, for us, we're broke.
We're not involved...

606
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:46,639
When Scott Walker announced that
Wisconsin is open for business,

607
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:51,638
I did not know at that time that
that meant that Wisconsin

608
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,516
was open for business

609
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:57,749
at the expense of workers,

610
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,314
at the expense of elders

611
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,690
who were depending
on Medicare benefits

612
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:04,592
for home health services

613
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:09,692
at the expense of people
who are already marginal.

614
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,668
The young lady from Wisconsin.

615
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,432
The Governor and I have
a really long history,

616
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:14,597
we're friends,

617
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,903
I'm crazy about his kids
and his wife,

618
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:19,239
but I'm not going to spend
my five minutes pretending

619
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:21,939
that we agree on anything.

620
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,681
You started out by giving
1 1 7 million dollars

621
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,346
worth of tax breaks
to wealthy people

622
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:33,380
which reduces revenue
and in contrast,

623
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:35,255
you cut the earned
income tax credit,

624
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,761
doubling the taxes on
the poorest parents.

625
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:41,287
What in the world does that have
to do with balancing a budget?

626
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,027
I have here a website,

627
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,764
"www.standwithwalker.com"

628
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:50,570
that is supported by
the Americans for Prosperity

629
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,906
and funded by
the Koch brothers.

630
00:31:52,944 --> 00:31:54,809
How much have you received
in contributions

631
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,108
from the Koch brothers.

632
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,444
I had 50,000 contributors,

633
00:31:57,482 --> 00:31:59,609
I couldn't tell you
who they all are.

634
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,779
Governor Walker, your proposal
would require unions

635
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,651
to hold annual votes

636
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,283
to continue representing
their own members.

637
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:10,488
Can you please explain to me and
members of this committee

638
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:15,625
how much money this provision
saves for your state budget?

639
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,259
We gave workers
the right to choose

640
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,270
which is a fundamental
American right,

641
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:20,635
the right to choose
whether or not

642
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,071
they want to be a
part of the union

643
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,006
- And whether or not they
want up to a thousand dollars
- Can you answer the question?

644
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,600
- Taking out of...
- How much money
does it save, Governor?

645
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,338
In particular it
doesn't save any...

646
00:32:27,378 --> 00:32:29,437
OK, that's right.
That's the point.

647
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,675
It obviously has no effect
whatsoever... ,

648
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,149
- I'll answer your question...
- I'm reclaiming my time.

649
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:36,176
it obviously had no effect
whatsoever on the state budget.

650
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,313
To pretend that this is
about a fiscal crisis

651
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,153
in the state of Wisconsin
is malarkey.

652
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,921
Seven of the top 1 0 donors
to political campaigns

653
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,758
donate to Republicans,

654
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,764
the other three all
donate to Democrats

655
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,822
and they're all unions.

656
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:51,426
This is the potential Armageddon
for organized labor,

657
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:55,963
public sector unions as
money laundering operations

658
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,497
for the Democrat Party.

659
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:01,672
Unions are the only competition
Republicans have

660
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,477
in electoral politics.

661
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:05,846
Post Citizens United,

662
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,283
conservatives look at this
and they smell blood.

663
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,913
Bust the unions,
it's over.

664
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,756
Hi, this is Scott Walker.

665
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,955
Scott, David Koch,
how are you?

666
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,591
How are you, David?
I'm good and yourself?

667
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:23,099
I'm very well.

668
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:24,999
I'm a little disheartened
by the situation there,

669
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,470
but what's the latest?

670
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:30,633
We're actually
hanging pretty tough.

671
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,542
What we're thinking about
the crowds was

672
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,206
planting and troublemakers.

673
00:33:38,483 --> 00:33:41,646
You know, the... well,
the only problem with...

674
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,813
because we thought about that,

675
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,154
my only fear would be
is if there was a ruckus caused

676
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,126
is that that would scare
the public in the thinking

677
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:53,528
maybe the Governor has
got to settle to avoid

678
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,362
all these problems.

679
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:58,335
There's a lot of us new
Governors who got elected

680
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,030
to do something big.

681
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:01,971
You're the first domino.

682
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,304
Yup, this is our moment.

683
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:05,331
Yeah.

684
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,071
Thirty years ago,

685
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,807
Ronald Reagan had one of
the most defining moments

686
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,576
of his political career

687
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,709
when he fired the
air traffic controllers.

688
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,548
To me that moment
was more important

689
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:18,487
than just for labor relations
or even the federal budget,

690
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:21,583
that was the first
crack in the Berlin Wall

691
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:22,820
and the fall of communism

692
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,760
because from that
point forward

693
00:34:24,796 --> 00:34:26,354
the Soviets and the communists

694
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:29,924
knew that Ronald Reagan
wasn't a pushover.

695
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,538
Well, I'll tell you what Scott.

696
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,164
Once you crush these bastards,

697
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:40,041
I'll fly out to Cali and
really show you a good time.

698
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,773
All right.
That would be outstanding.

699
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,873
Now, what else can we
do for you down there?

700
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,249
Well the biggest thing it would
be and your guy on the ground

701
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,914
is probably seeing this
is after this

702
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:53,116
a lot of these guys
are going to need...

703
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,715
They don't necessarily
need ads for them,

704
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,750
but they're going to
need a message out

705
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,422
reinforcing why this was a good
thing to do for the economy

706
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,295
and good thing to do
for the state.

707
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,926
So the extent that that message
is out over and over again

708
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,936
that's obviously a good thing.

709
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,961
Who decides Wisconsin's future,

710
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:10,303
voters or government unions?

711
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:13,606
Wisconsin voted for fiscal
sanity and balanced budgets,

712
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:15,737
but government workers
fight to keep benefits

713
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,805
far better than
the private sector.

714
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,818
Democratic legislators refuse
to show up for their jobs

715
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,717
hiding out in other states.

716
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:26,245
And incredibly, President
Obama backs the union bosses

717
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,885
and floods Wisconsin with out
of state political protesters.

718
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,622
Governor Walker has the courage

719
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,630
to do what's right
for Wisconsin.

720
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:35,291
Americans for Prosperity
is responsible

721
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,800
for the content of this
advertisement.

722
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,893
That's those are American
for Prosperity ads,

723
00:35:38,936 --> 00:35:40,631
those are Koch brother ads.

724
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:42,229
...To all that
outside spending,

725
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:45,606
some of it coming from groups
that aren't even in Wisconsin.

726
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,237
...Own democracy
campaign estimates

727
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:51,612
that a total of 30 million
dollars will be spent...

728
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,276
- Jesus!
- Thirty million dollars,

729
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,615
do you think they could find
something better to do

730
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:56,984
with 30 million dollars like,

731
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:59,012
maybe the Koch's
could pay their taxes

732
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:00,853
and then we wouldn't be
in this mess.

733
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:03,793
You know how many homeless
veterans that would feed?

734
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,489
Thirty million bucks.

735
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:09,755
I am watching my
Republican Party implode.

736
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,466
...Clerk call the roll.

737
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,971
- No! No! No!
- Excuse me.

738
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,496
Listen it says,
if it's any doubt

739
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:18,372
as to whether good
cause exists,

740
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,503
the governmental body should
provide 24 hours notice.

741
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,208
This is clearly a violation
of Open Meetings Law.

742
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:26,546
The Republican lawmakers
were able to separate

743
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:29,144
the portion of Governor
Scott Walker's budget bill

744
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,052
that deals with
collective bargaining

745
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:34,023
and pass that on its own
in the absence of the

746
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:37,027
state's 14 missing
Democratic Senators.

747
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:40,990
[CROWD CLAMORING]

748
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,636
This is about the
presidential election in 201 2.

749
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,536
If we win this battle

750
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,371
and the money is not there

751
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,037
under the auspices
of the unions,

752
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,273
certainly what you're going
to find is President Obama

753
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,975
is going to have a
much difficult,

754
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:00,540
a much more difficult time
getting elected

755
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,678
and winning the
state of Wisconsin.

756
00:37:03,854 --> 00:37:07,221
If you never voted before,
I bet you will now.

757
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:41,487
Madison, these are the
front lines in the battle

758
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:44,187
for the future of our country!

759
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,759
Mr. Obama,

760
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:52,360
Mr. President, you and your
cohorts threw all the hatred

761
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,735
and all the violence
that you could

762
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:58,333
at these good folks here
in Madison, Wisconsin,

763
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,606
but you lost here.

764
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:08,712
And Madison, you defended
that 201 0 electoral mandate,

765
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:12,052
you are heroes,
you are patriots.

766
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:18,922
Your historic stand brought down
the curtain on the last election

767
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:23,024
and the 201 2 election
begins here.

768
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:32,467
I would join my brother in
expressing my appreciation

769
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:37,777
for your support
and presence here this weekend.

770
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:42,878
What I want to do is
recognize those partners

771
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,981
who had given more than a
billion... a million. No...

772
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,487
I'm going to go easy on you,

773
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,228
more than a million
over the last 12 months.

774
00:38:57,268 --> 00:38:59,463
If you want to
kick in a billion,

775
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:03,564
believe me, we'll have a
special seminar just for you.

776
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:06,734
We've had a lot
of tough battles.

777
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:11,111
We've lost a lot over the years
and we've won some recently,

778
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:13,776
set the stage for,
as I said,

779
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,911
the mother of all
battles coming up a

780
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,818
year from November

781
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:21,188
and I've pledged to all
of you who've stepped forward

782
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:23,318
and are partnering with us,

783
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,694
but we are absolutely
going to do our utmost

784
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,928
to invest this money wisely

785
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,595
and to get the best
possible payoff for you

786
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:34,194
and the future of our country.

787
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:41,602
What we need to do is pass the
mother of all repeal bills

788
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:44,113
and I would begin with the EPA.

789
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,378
And one of the things the
Congress should do immediately

790
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,783
is defund the National
Labor Relations Board.

791
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,616
We could rein back the scale
of the government

792
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:51,985
and that's the
right thing to do.

793
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:53,649
It's three agencies
of government

794
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,352
when I get there
that are gone.

795
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,885
Commerce, education
and the...

796
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,658
what's the third one
there, let's see...

797
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:04,395
Watch out Mitt,
watch out Rick Perry,

798
00:40:04,435 --> 00:40:05,663
you watch out,

799
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:08,729
you give me a foot hold
in one of these debates,

800
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:11,071
I will tear their breaches up.

801
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:16,178
I'm a farm boy.
I'm a small businessman.

802
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:17,407
I'm a family guy.

803
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,939
I'm the only guy running
who's been a congressman

804
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:21,008
and a Governor.

805
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:23,485
Hundred dollar limit.
I don't take PAC money,

806
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:24,681
no special interest money.

807
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,986
I'm Buddy Roemer,
I'm running for president;

808
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:29,652
president of the
United States of America.

809
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:37,128
Governor, how are you?

810
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:38,226
Buddy Roemer, how are you?

811
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,237
Do you always
travel Amtrak, Governor?

812
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,863
I do.
It's cheap.

813
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,067
It's subsidized
by the taxpayers.

814
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,133
Where is the
Secret Service today?

815
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,042
I don't have Secret Service man,

816
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:52,640
I've got Carlos from El Paso,
Carlos Sierra.

817
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:56,815
You know the first question
people ask me

818
00:40:56,854 --> 00:41:00,187
because I've been at this
for six months or more,

819
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:02,192
day after day,

820
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:05,525
and they say, "Why haven't
you been on a debate?"

821
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,531
"You're the only guy running
who's been a congressman

822
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:08,657
and a Governor."

823
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,758
You're a fairly successful
business man

824
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,235
and what's the reason you
can't get on a debate?

825
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,397
And I don't even have
an answer for that,

826
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:16,838
I don't know.

827
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,001
I called after I had
formally announced

828
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:20,738
that I was running
for president,

829
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:25,044
and they said, oh, you have
to have 1% of the vote.

830
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,115
Three weeks later,
we were 1%, I called again.

831
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,250
And they said,
oh, it's 2% now.

832
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:40,461
So we made the 2% mark
and we called again

833
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,934
and they said, you not
only have to have 2%,

834
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,766
you have to raise a
half a million dollars

835
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:49,295
in the last 90 days.

836
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:54,734
It's big business and there's
a place for a big business,

837
00:41:54,778 --> 00:42:00,045
but is it in determining
who even runs for president?

838
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:03,383
What kind of country are we?

839
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,254
He has grounds to feel
mistreated by the system

840
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,588
and I'm not a
conspiracy theorist,

841
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,720
I don't know who is it who
decided time and time again

842
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,593
that he shouldn't be
in the debates,

843
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,792
but clearly, what he
wanted to talk about

844
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,267
is not what the Republican
leadership in Washington

845
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:19,599
wanted to focus on.

846
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,128
The politicians
don't run the country,

847
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:25,005
the major corporations do.

848
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,907
Congress acts like
the gates are opened,

849
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,241
there's nothing they can do

850
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,737
and the president
who is not a leader.

851
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,750
And I maybe very specific.

852
00:42:33,784 --> 00:42:37,811
He is a participant
in the fraud.

853
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,914
I mean,
he signs bank reform,

854
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,948
runs to Wall Street
the next week,

855
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:45,189
has a $35,000-ticket
fundraiser

856
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,163
sponsored by Goldman Sachs.

857
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,097
Now, that's independent.

858
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,998
But Congress could
do something.

859
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:53,196
I've given them six things
they could do,

860
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,865
all they need is courage.

861
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,205
I feel a speech coming on,
I don't give a...

862
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:07,877
New York.

863
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,385
Here's what I want
to do with you today.

864
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,548
I want to draw the line between
the kitchen table issue

865
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,648
and money and politics.

866
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:14,953
So you don't have a job,

867
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,482
your grandma can't
get healthcare,

868
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:17,892
kid can't go to school.

869
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,395
Got no fucking heating oil,

870
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,624
so I'm going to push you
and say

871
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:24,623
- Tell me Governor and you
just draw the connection.
- I'm there. I'm there.

872
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:26,966
Governor, they don't seem to
want you in the conversation.

873
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:30,872
This issue as you know Dylan
goes much deeper than that.

874
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:32,637
If you have a big check,

875
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,576
you stand first in line

876
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:38,013
and I don't call that a
representative democracy.

877
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:40,915
Sometimes it's a check,

878
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:44,751
sometimes it's the
threat of a check.

879
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,882
It's like heaven or weapon.

880
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:52,589
You could shoot the gun
or just show it,

881
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,827
it works both ways.

882
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:58,630
And money is a weapon.

883
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:01,069
It doesn't add to the debate,

884
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,972
it don't increase the
number of Americans,

885
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:07,671
it's in the very rich
and powerful

886
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:09,702
have more of it
than anybody else.

887
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:11,908
Let me put it in another way.

888
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:15,214
They have more guns
than anybody.

889
00:44:15,252 --> 00:44:17,652
Who wins those battles?

890
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,657
I know I wanted to be a
teacher in seventh grade.

891
00:44:26,697 --> 00:44:31,396
I wanted to make a
difference for one child.

892
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:33,335
It was everything I ever wanted.

893
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:37,206
I worry about the young
people in the profession,

894
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:39,368
I worry about the
students' needs.

895
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:44,211
So even though I feel like
I am truly a conservative,

896
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:46,682
truly a Christian conservative,

897
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:50,346
Governor Walker's
agenda frightens me.

898
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:57,016
It's made me question whether
or not they truly represent me

899
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:59,052
and what I believe in.

900
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:04,797
That's another teacher's home,
again opulent.

901
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,371
You know, I don't get where
regular people

902
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:09,531
have become the enemy.

903
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:12,633
You know,
I've served at every level

904
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:15,736
and now you're the bad guy.

905
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,775
Next up I have is
for Brian Cunningham.

906
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,448
I want to thank you
for being here today

907
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:29,118
because my voice has been
stolen from me.

908
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,720
It was hard being a correctional
officer 1 0 years ago,

909
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:35,960
it's almost impossible now.

910
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:40,299
You pay us to go there
to do that job,

911
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:43,101
Scott Walker's ACT 1 0
to just block that job.

912
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,937
He said it's about money,
let's break the union,

913
00:45:44,975 --> 00:45:48,672
let's break the money train
to support political parties.

914
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:53,649
It's tough to go and protect the
state of Wisconsin every day.

915
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,244
Brian, if you were thinking
about what were the one or two

916
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:58,618
immediate things maybe
that we should focus on

917
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,917
to improve safety...

918
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:01,754
Recall Walker.

919
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:10,856
Signature gathering
has began in earnest.

920
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,631
The signing has
started at 1 2:01 a.m.

921
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:20,870
I can't tell you how many times
over the years I've been emailed

922
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:24,176
or called by somebody who is
ticked off at a public official.

923
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:26,341
And he said,
how do we recall that joker.

924
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:28,613
And I would say, well if
it's a statewide office holder,

925
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,347
you need 540,000 signatures

926
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:32,480
and it would end the
conversation right there.

927
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:35,520
Whoa!

928
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:39,786
Oh, that works good and then
we can take it down at night.

929
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,229
This is my neighbor Gordy,

930
00:46:41,265 --> 00:46:42,732
he lives just down
the road from us.

931
00:46:42,766 --> 00:46:43,664
Okay...

932
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,902
A lot of people say,
gee you're Republican,

933
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,406
how can you recall a Republican?

934
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,900
It's like, Governor Walker
is a Tea Partier.

935
00:46:54,945 --> 00:46:58,847
Tea Party and Republicans
are not the same thing

936
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:03,342
and I personally do not
espouse the Tea Party principles

937
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:07,653
of cutting government service
in order to balance our budget.

938
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:09,659
There.
Now we go her done.

939
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,388
Yeah, get rid of that guy.

940
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:15,330
Walker is a bully
and I was a union man

941
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:18,994
and if it wasn't for the union
I couldn't have retired.

942
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,402
I had to worked
until I was 1 00.

943
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,107
Both my wife and I are county
workers and when I took the job,

944
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:29,943
I took a paid cut for benefits
and I'm losing my benefits.

945
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,242
How have you been doing?

946
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,043
Really good.

947
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:33,743
We only have 900 people
in this town

948
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:36,184
and we've already got
about 50 signatures.

949
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,312
You don't pay taxes?

950
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,585
- I pay employment taxes...
- What are you talking about?

951
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:41,716
Bunch of goons.

952
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:44,750
I pay employment taxes.
I pay business taxes.

953
00:47:44,795 --> 00:47:47,059
I pay plenty of taxes, sir.

954
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:50,824
What Wall Street did to us
is just awful.

955
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,996
I think eventually
everything comes around,

956
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,436
but I'm 80 years old

957
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:58,407
and sometimes I'm not sure
it's going to come around,

958
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:00,569
you know, in my lifetime.

959
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,541
And there's my hubby pulling up.

960
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,549
Hey, baby, come up
and see you later.

961
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,242
I should be around.

962
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,085
One of hunting buddies
stop by the other day,

963
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:19,118
he signed here and the
other signature is me,

964
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,687
but we got two.

965
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,792
Two in the big effort
multiplied by a thousand

966
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:28,134
other little bike shops
like this.

967
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:30,765
There's 2000 signatures,
you know.

968
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:36,242
Every part on this motorcycle
is American made.

969
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,578
My American dream
has fallen apart here.

970
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:41,106
That's all big business,
the almighty dollar

971
00:48:41,151 --> 00:48:45,451
and greed and the
corporate monster.

972
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:48,117
That's my opinion, kind of.

973
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:50,922
But I really don't have
a reason to whine

974
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,622
because I don't vote.

975
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:58,600
A friend of mine, he goes,

976
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:01,263
have you gotten any use for
an indoor burner like that?

977
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:03,296
I go, you bet.

978
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,171
So he gave it to me.

979
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,642
The bartering days
are back here again,

980
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:10,078
have been for quite a
while in this area.

981
00:49:11,982 --> 00:49:16,351
I even make my own cigarettes
because of the cost.

982
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:19,184
It makes me sound like a
real hillbilly don't it?

983
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:33,594
It's pretty sad.

984
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,504
These millionaires, aren't they
happy just being millionaires?

985
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,974
Do they really have
to be gazillionaires?

986
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:41,477
Well, they're just going to
keep crushing the middle class,

987
00:49:41,511 --> 00:49:44,309
crushing the poor people.

988
00:49:44,348 --> 00:49:45,815
And does it bother them?

989
00:49:45,849 --> 00:49:47,282
No.

990
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:51,344
Just buy your way into a
certain level in politics,

991
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,219
that ain't cool.

992
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:56,157
People should run on their
merits not how much money

993
00:49:56,193 --> 00:50:00,061
that so and so is dumping
on their campaign fund.

994
00:50:00,097 --> 00:50:02,622
That's their world of bartering.

995
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,799
State law will allow
Governor Scott Walker to collect

996
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:14,402
unlimited donations to his
possible recall campaign.

997
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:17,845
The Governor can raise unlimited
cash and donors have flocked.

998
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:20,714
His top three donors are
all from out of state.

999
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:22,082
Texan homebuilder Bob Perry

1000
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:24,246
gave a quarter of a
million dollars,

1001
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,812
he was the man behind
the 2004 Swift Vote

1002
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,417
ad campaign against John Kerry.

1003
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,825
Illinois couple Elizabeth
and Robert Uihlein

1004
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,092
gave $205,000.

1005
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,929
Third is Wyoming investor,
Foster Friess

1006
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,561
who gave a $100,000.

1007
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:40,892
On the democratic side,

1008
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:43,235
Washington D.C. based
United Food

1009
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:46,174
and Commercial Workers
Union gave $20,000.

1010
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,938
State workers union AFSCME

1011
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:50,776
gave just more than $1 1,000.

1012
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:57,013
The unions don't have as much
money even in our wildest dreams

1013
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,420
as the Koch brothers themselves.

1014
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,425
It's unfortunate and unfair

1015
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:06,088
that outside millionaires
from Kansas and Texas

1016
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:09,292
can dump unlimited
amounts of money,

1017
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:11,027
but they can also through
Governor Walker

1018
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:15,664
and the legislature cripple our
ability to do the same thing.

1019
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:20,005
It's a power grab the change not
only the rules of the game,

1020
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:26,414
but to try to take us out
of the process altogether.

1021
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:30,352
Not just the wiping out of
public employee unions

1022
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:32,082
and collective
bargaining rights,

1023
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:35,421
but also the Voter
Identification Law,

1024
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:39,122
the redistricting,
all tactical,

1025
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:41,756
but tactical with an eye
to the next election

1026
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:43,425
and the election therefore.

1027
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:47,733
There's very little proof of any
serious voter fraud anywhere,

1028
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,467
but so far 31 states
have jumped on the

1029
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,873
Voter ID bandwagon anyway.

1030
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:56,208
In Madison, the state assembly
is taking up the Voter ID Bill.

1031
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:59,079
It was just about a decade ago

1032
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,108
that I first introduced a
photo ID requirement.

1033
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:07,556
This has been a long term desire
on the part of Governor Walker

1034
00:52:07,591 --> 00:52:11,994
to limit the electorate
for the benefit of,

1035
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:14,292
I believe corporate interest.

1036
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:18,096
Fifty-five percent of all
African-American males

1037
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:21,002
in Wisconsin have no photo ID.

1038
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:23,267
Forty-nine percent of
African-American women

1039
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,796
have no photo ID.

1040
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:26,741
Forty-nine percent
of Hispanic men,

1041
00:52:26,776 --> 00:52:28,744
59% of Hispanic women

1042
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:31,838
and when you get to the
1 8- To 24-year-old group,

1043
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:36,979
78% of African-American males
have no photo ID.

1044
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:40,922
You need a photo ID
to fly on an airplane.

1045
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:44,290
Well, yeah, if you're middle
class you fly on airplanes,

1046
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:47,160
but guess what, there are
millions of Americans

1047
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:50,826
that don't fly on airplanes
and guess what,

1048
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:54,667
you don't have a constitutional
right to fly on an airplane.

1049
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:58,470
As simple as things like getting
cold medicine requires photo ID.

1050
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:05,209
Well, unfortunately, healthcare
is not a constitutional right,

1051
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,648
but voting is.

1052
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:19,856
Listen to me American,
you're unimportant.

1053
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,864
They don't care about you

1054
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:24,867
because you don't bring a check.

1055
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:29,803
Welcome back everyone.

1056
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,500
In Hampshire, will pick
who it believes

1057
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,338
should be the
Republican nominee

1058
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,674
for president
of the United States.

1059
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:44,018
Mr. Roemer you've been quoted
as saying that your GOP rivals

1060
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,852
for president are
"bought and sold."

1061
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,915
But the bottom line is there
are more debates coming

1062
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:50,187
and you're not going to
be able to get into

1063
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,216
any of them, right?

1064
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:54,526
In New Hampshire, they have
two debates coming up

1065
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:56,862
that would be
nationally televised...

1066
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,095
That's my only chance.

1067
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:01,899
Buddy Roemer campaigning
in the grand state today.

1068
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,371
I think the rest of
them are bullshit.

1069
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,168
- Nice meeting you.
- All right, you too.

1070
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:05,333
See you, Easia.

1071
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,002
I never had barber
looked like you.

1072
00:54:07,043 --> 00:54:09,375
I'm a banker and
forgive me for that.

1073
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,037
Oh, yeah...

1074
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,775
Let's get the big money
out of the room.

1075
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,214
That's me and you
run the country.

1076
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,184
All right, we could do it.
We could do it.

1077
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,196
You should see how
many people are saying,

1078
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,297
don't give up Buddy,
don't give up.

1079
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:40,636
He has amazing Twitter.

1080
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:43,145
Whenever he gets an audience on
some of those national shows,

1081
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,545
we always get an
increase in Facebook likes,

1082
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,550
Twitter followers and donations.

1083
00:54:47,584 --> 00:54:50,883
We've only raised
about 32,000 last week.

1084
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,547
It was our best week ever.

1085
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,188
We're going to Calef's
for a sandwiches,

1086
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,852
anybody wants one.

1087
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:58,883
- Buddy.
- Buddy, yeah.

1088
00:54:58,928 --> 00:54:59,394
Buddy.

1089
00:54:59,429 --> 00:55:01,397
He used to be the
Governor of Louisiana.

1090
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:01,920
Oh!

1091
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,557
I deny everything.

1092
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,090
My name is... a Louisiana
Governor

1093
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,932
that didn't go to jail...

1094
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:10,599
It's the first time I've
given a contribution

1095
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,939
and it's actually the first
time that I'll be voting

1096
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,275
because I didn't think
my vote mattered.

1097
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,974
I think they're all corrupt.

1098
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,983
I always think I'd be picking
the lesser of the two evils

1099
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:22,780
and I guess I saw
something in him.

1100
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:27,051
We bought two television
commercials on the debates.

1101
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,058
Really? Good.

1102
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:30,821
So man, we are flying high.

1103
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,259
That's good.
That's real good.

1104
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:33,284
That's awesome.

1105
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,820
- We're not going to
be in the debate.
- Yes.

1106
00:55:34,864 --> 00:55:36,923
But I expect to be proud.

1107
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:39,059
I expect to tweet every answer.

1108
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,626
I expect to give them hell.

1109
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,228
There are our new poll numbers

1110
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:44,672
heading into the final
weekend of the campaign.

1111
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:48,474
The poll they're using
has a margin of error 5.5%.

1112
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,502
I mean just think about that,
5.5%

1113
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,948
so if we got 1% that means
that we could have gotten 6.5

1114
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:55,450
and would have qualified.

1115
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:59,414
Tonight, all eyes
on New Hampshire.

1116
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:01,447
We put them all to the test.

1117
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:02,788
Seven old white men.

1118
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:04,487
Governor Romney,
we'll begin with you...

1119
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,690
Ready to be the Twitter
of the world, Ms. Jill?

1120
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,528
Tweeter of the free world.

1121
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,659
Governor Huntsman, Afghanistan.

1122
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,169
I believe it's time to
come home and I would say...

1123
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,671
Get him out.

1124
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,367
Come on John,
get a little passion.

1125
00:56:18,408 --> 00:56:21,707
It's a troubled nation,
they're corrupt at the top.

1126
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,111
It's Louisiana
in a bigger stage?

1127
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:28,884
Buddy, you know you're
as good as these guys.

1128
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:30,783
I honor them,
but it's frustrating.

1129
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:32,811
Bullshit, you're as
good as they are.

1130
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:35,450
Why is Rick Perry up
there and you're not?

1131
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:37,221
I don't know.

1132
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,023
Mr. 1%.

1133
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:42,520
I would send troops back into
Iraq because I will tell you...

1134
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,827
Oh, man!

1135
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:46,301
I think we start talking
with the Iraqi...

1136
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:50,033
Texas, they've done a good
job for us over the years,

1137
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,301
please.

1138
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:54,001
- Do you know who the largest
corporate giver is
- This is us?

1139
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:55,874
to policy issues in Washington?

1140
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:58,472
Goldman freaking Sachs.

1141
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:00,745
Go on, buddy! Man.

1142
00:57:00,784 --> 00:57:02,308
Is bought and sold...

1143
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:03,819
They don't want you here...

1144
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:06,014
They don't seem to want
you in the conversation.

1145
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:09,024
Wake up America, they've
stolen your government.

1147
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:13,419
The highlight of
the debate, thus far.

1148
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:16,432
Is there any one on the
stage you guys will be afraid of

1149
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:17,899
having as a president?

1150
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,027
Why don't you ask
an easier question?

1151
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:22,003
Is there anyone you trust?

1152
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:34,512
Talking to Scott Walker,
Governor of Wisconsin.

1153
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:36,610
Hey Rush, great to be with you
and your listeners.

1154
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:38,518
Signatures are due today,
is that right?

1155
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:42,116
They said they're probably
going to turn in 720,000 today.

1156
00:57:42,158 --> 00:57:44,422
We don't even know who the
candidate is against us yet,

1157
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,361
the real opponent will be
this money coming in

1158
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:49,126
from out of state from these
government unions.

1159
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:51,891
In the end,
we're going to prevail,

1160
00:57:51,935 --> 00:57:54,062
but it's going to
take a ton of support.

1161
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:55,764
In the last two months,
we raised more money

1162
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:57,796
than any candidate for
Governor ever has.

1163
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:13,286
Tomorrow morning it
becomes official,

1164
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,950
you're going to be facing
a recall in the state.

1165
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,219
Well, we assume it.

1166
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:18,056
I mean, when the national
union has got involved,

1167
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:19,652
we assumed the money
and the power behind it

1168
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:20,754
to make that happen.

1169
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,288
We view our opposition being
primarily out of state,

1170
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,631
special interest money and the
bigger government unions.

1171
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,431
We need to be prepared to
get the message out

1172
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:28,198
to spread the truth.

1173
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,763
This is Upfront
with Viicki Mckenna.

1174
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:32,468
Tiim Phillips, my pal,

1175
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:35,069
from Americans for
Prosperity out,

1176
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,602
knocking on doors,
shaking hands, kissing babies.

1177
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:39,808
Tiim Phillips,
welcome to the show.

1178
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,612
Viicki, it's always
good to be with you.

1179
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:44,245
Right now Republicans
and libertarians

1180
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:48,986
have a voting advantage
over Democrats of plus 14

1181
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:52,324
and that's because of the
work of groups likes yours.

1182
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,956
I'm telling you on the ground

1183
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,489
for the first time
in my lifetime

1184
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,468
we're beating the left.

1185
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:02,767
Black liberation and socialism.

1186
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:05,433
Have you heard of
black liberation before?

1187
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:09,673
White European man is evil man
and black liberation theology,

1188
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:13,148
it's a Marxist form,
so-called form of Christianity.

1189
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:15,150
And that's what our president...

1190
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:17,846
actually he was educated for
20 years in that church.

1191
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,613
And don't let people tell you
that there weren't

1192
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:21,817
communism in Hollywood.

1193
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,588
there were and Ronald Reagan
fought those people

1194
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:25,821
back in the day.

1195
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:28,854
Yes, I love Ronny.
I miss him. I miss the Gipper.

1196
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:32,999
Now, the ubiquitous
socialist fist:

1197
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:35,470
I saw everywhere
down in Madison,

1198
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:39,373
Recall Walker, AFL-CIO,
Stand with Wisconsin.

1199
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:42,139
The socialist permeate all
throughout the unions

1200
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:44,942
in Wisconsin and
across the country.

1201
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:49,850
How is it we go from a republic
to now we're all socialist?

1202
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:51,717
It's education.
It's the culture.

1203
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,619
There's a culture war going on.

1204
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:57,148
It's 1 933... 1 934,
who took over Germany?

1205
00:59:57,193 --> 00:59:58,353
Hitler.

1206
00:59:58,394 --> 00:59:59,986
And he hated what people?

1207
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:00,688
The Jews.

1208
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:03,130
And they were all Jews
so guess where they came?

1209
01:00:03,166 --> 01:00:04,292
Here.

1210
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,529
They came here to
Columbia, Madison,

1211
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:08,196
Berkeley, they infiltrated.

1212
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:10,705
Just like the Fabians
of 20, 30 years earlier

1213
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:16,736
and they were the teachers
of our future teachers.

1214
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,542
I got to tell you something.

1215
01:00:18,581 --> 01:00:21,982
If Obama gets four more years
and appoints two more justices,

1216
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:24,748
I'm telling you we are done
dancing as a republic.

1217
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,311
We've got to stop him.

1218
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:27,653
Republicans.
Republicans.

1219
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:29,590
Tea Parties,
turn out June 5th

1220
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:33,392
and keep Governor Walker
in office

1221
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:37,263
and turn out November 6th
and keep out Obama.

1222
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,927
Thank you.

1223
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:45,097
I often wondered why our
country get so bad,

1224
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,439
what's causing it,
what's right there.

1225
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:50,105
You don't realize how it's
permeated to the culture.

1226
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,341
There was a lot of people from
my church that came out and

1227
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,179
I was so glad to see you.

1228
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:57,050
I knew it was bad, but I
didn't know it was that bad.

1229
01:00:57,086 --> 01:01:01,079
- Just good to have a teacher
stand up for what's right.
- We need more teachers.

1230
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:03,251
He's an inspiration.
Totally.

1231
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:19,900
I don't think that
these Tea Partiers

1232
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:23,400
who are being sold down the
river by these politicians

1233
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:25,812
taking all their
corporate money,

1234
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:28,715
really quite realize that

1235
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:35,085
in order for what they
consider smaller government,

1236
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:38,389
they are going to dismantle
our social safety nets

1237
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:41,653
and that's our grandparents,
our parents

1238
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,325
and some of our children

1239
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:46,062
that will not be able
to get healthcare,

1240
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:50,095
that will not be able to
collect their retirements.

1241
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,471
And I mean, why are they
so mad at the unions?

1242
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:53,839
Unions gave us the weekend,

1243
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:56,401
unions gave us the
40-hour workweeks.

1244
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,680
Instead of being upset
about what the unions

1245
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,653
have bargained for
in their contracts,

1246
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:09,283
you would think that they
would want to help us

1247
01:02:09,325 --> 01:02:11,418
bring up everyone's
employment

1248
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,453
so that everyone could
have a living wage.

1249
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:16,397
She got a couple of death
threats over this shit

1250
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:18,627
she'd been in and that.

1251
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:20,499
We know where you work,
we know where you live,

1252
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:21,935
watch your car,

1253
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:23,666
be careful when you
turn the ignition.

1254
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:26,675
It was one of these Tea Party
assholes that one was.

1255
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:28,802
Did you get on the
phone with him or...?

1256
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:30,904
No, she's told the guy,

1257
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:34,576
you failed to realize
my husband is a hairy biker

1258
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:36,414
that believes in
the castle law.

1259
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:37,749
That's what she told him.

1260
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:40,255
He was really upset
and he was like,

1261
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:42,257
"Maybe you should
stop doing this."

1262
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:44,657
And I told him and
I said, "You know,

1263
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,663
the minute you do that
you let them win."

1264
01:02:50,032 --> 01:02:52,330
I think this is worth
fighting for.

1265
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,038
Honestly, I think America
is worth dying for

1266
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:59,701
that's why I joined in the
military in the first place.

1267
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,111
The Tea Party sure as hell

1268
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:10,449
should not be voting
for Scott Walker.

1269
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,647
Scott Walker took one
and a half billion dollars

1270
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:14,121
from state employes,

1271
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:16,955
he gave it back to
special interest groups

1272
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:19,461
that is the
redistribution of wealth

1273
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:24,694
and that does not fall inside
the Tea Party objective.

1274
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:28,363
When everybody in the state
is making $1 0 an hour,

1275
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:30,235
how our any home loans
going to happen?

1276
01:03:30,273 --> 01:03:32,639
How is anybody
going to build a house?

1277
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,973
They want to turn us
into India,

1278
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:36,842
we'll all be answering phones.

1279
01:03:39,749 --> 01:03:41,478
People like the Koch brothers

1280
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:44,077
have purchased
the Republican Party.

1281
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,213
- 30-1 3?
- Yeah.

1282
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:48,223
it's not my party anymore.

1283
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:51,219
- All right.
- It's very presidential.

1284
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:55,356
My fellow tax... Americans.

1285
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:57,332
If I've said
"my fellow taxpayers,"

1286
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:59,891
I would only be talking
to half of Americans.

1287
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:05,100
Three, two, one.

1288
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:07,405
Last night the Republicans held

1289
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:10,844
their 23rd nationally
televised debate

1290
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,110
in this primary election.

1291
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:16,915
I have not been invited
to a single debate,

1292
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:21,390
so today we're dropping out
of the Republican Party

1293
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:24,882
where I've been a proud
member for 21 years

1294
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:27,589
and we're becoming
an independent.

1295
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:32,624
A 1 00 years ago that
great Republican

1296
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:35,762
who turned independent,
Teddy Roosevelt,

1297
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:39,798
he said the Republican Party
is now facing a great crisis.

1298
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:43,608
It's to decide whether it will
be as in the days of Lincoln,

1299
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:46,444
the party of plain people

1300
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:49,280
orwhether it will be
the party of privilege

1301
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:50,979
and of special interest,

1302
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:56,219
we are prepared to
challenge both parties

1303
01:04:56,259 --> 01:05:00,719
who were joined at the billfold
they're just alike.

1304
01:05:00,763 --> 01:05:03,459
Watch us challenge them,

1305
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:07,560
watch us put America first.

1306
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:08,900
Thanks.

1307
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:10,565
Great job, Governor.

1308
01:05:12,475 --> 01:05:14,943
We've got to remember that
90% Americans

1309
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:16,604
- Have never heard of me.
- Yeah.

1310
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:19,012
- More than that.
- More than that.

1311
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:23,279
This is a struggle just to
get your name out there.

1312
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:29,454
Republicans are
fighting for money, time,

1313
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:31,289
and volunteers
as both a recall

1314
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:33,454
and presidential primary
elections approach.

1315
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:35,088
Have we kept you
well-fed in Wisconsin?

1316
01:05:35,131 --> 01:05:36,496
Uh... Yeah,
cheese curds.

1317
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:38,864
Calista and I have shares
of Packer's stock.

1318
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:40,425
Is that what you
call yourselves here?

1319
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:41,731
Wisconsinites?

1320
01:05:42,872 --> 01:05:46,000
Governor Walker
is one of my heroes.

1321
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:49,341
Wisconsin is paying more
attention to that race

1322
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:52,836
than to this primary.

1323
01:05:52,882 --> 01:05:54,611
Let's end the civil war,

1324
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:56,675
let's restore trust in
the government

1325
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:59,119
and let's fix this state,
let's do it

1326
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:00,782
and let's win June 5th.

1327
01:06:00,823 --> 01:06:03,087
Thank you very much.
Let's go get them.

1328
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:04,989
How are you going to overcome
30 million dollars

1329
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:06,688
that Walker is going to
spend in this election?

1330
01:06:06,729 --> 01:06:10,597
United States won the gold
medal in the Olympics in 1 980.

1331
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:13,259
Thank you guys.
Take care.

1332
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,477
All this money coming
into the campaign

1333
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,812
means you owe a
debt to somebody.

1334
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,511
No, the debt I owe to
is the taxpayers,

1335
01:06:29,552 --> 01:06:30,951
the hardworking
taxpayers of the state.

1336
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,113
I think the people
around this state

1337
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,485
and many around the country,

1338
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:36,116
I mean, 76.4%
of all my donations

1339
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,626
came from people giving
50 bucks or less.

1340
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:46,996
What did out of state
billionaires like

1341
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:51,200
Trevor Reese Jones and Bob Perry
and Foster Friess

1342
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:54,209
and the Koch brothers seek to
get from Governor Walker?

1343
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:56,905
They've contributed millions
of dollars for his campaign.

1344
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:59,073
More than 76% of the
Governor's contribution...

1345
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:00,707
- I'm talking about the
high dollar donors.
- Sure.

1346
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:03,241
More than 76% of the
Governor's contributions

1347
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:05,082
have been for $50 or less.

1348
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:07,214
- But how about the
high dollar donors?
- Sure.

1349
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:09,315
I'm not in a position to speak

1350
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:12,054
for these contributors
to the campaign,

1351
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:14,927
but what I can tell you is
that more than 76%

1352
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,158
of our contributions have come...

1353
01:07:16,198 --> 01:07:17,995
But you're not
answering the question.

1354
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,865
I'll take another question.

1355
01:07:21,971 --> 01:07:24,496
It's pretty transparent
what the labor unions want.

1356
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,167
What is it of
high dollars donors,

1357
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,732
I'm not talking
about the low dollar,

1358
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,210
I'm talking about the
high dollar donors,

1359
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:30,940
what is it that they're going
to get in return... and

1360
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,538
what do they
hope to get in return?

1361
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:33,912
Yeah, interestingly these donors

1362
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:35,678
don't have any business
in Wisconsin.

1363
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:39,449
These are not people who have
really a vested interest

1364
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:40,716
in the state of Wisconsin,

1365
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:42,724
so they don't get anything
from this at all.

1366
01:07:42,758 --> 01:07:44,851
But don't the Koch's own
six paper factories

1367
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,021
and an oil pipeline
in Wisconsin?

1368
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,190
- You've mentioned a
number of other contributors.
- Sure.

1369
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:51,290
Certainly, there are people who
have given to Governor Walker

1370
01:07:51,333 --> 01:07:53,801
who have an interest in
the state of Wisconsin.

1371
01:07:53,836 --> 01:07:57,272
More than $60 million has been
spent on this recall effort,

1372
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,866
nearly 46 million on
the Republican side,

1373
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,707
almost 20 million on
the Democratic side.

1374
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,270
Outside groups have been playing
a very big role in all this.

1375
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:08,715
Tim Phillips is the president
of Americans for Prosperity,

1376
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,719
a Super PAC funded
by the Kock brothers,

1377
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:11,913
and he joins me here live.

1378
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:12,784
It's good to see you.

1379
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:13,914
Chris,
we're not a Super PAC,

1380
01:08:13,956 --> 01:08:15,753
we're a C4
grassroots organization.

1381
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:17,156
How much have you
put in Wisconsin?

1382
01:08:17,193 --> 01:08:20,162
Since January of last
year just over $1 0 million.

1383
01:08:20,196 --> 01:08:21,322
Ten million dollars.

1384
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:23,763
The day after the reforms were
put forward in the legislature

1385
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:25,926
before the Democrats
high tailed it to Illinois,

1386
01:08:25,968 --> 01:08:28,300
we began running ads and
supported this legislation.

1387
01:08:28,337 --> 01:08:29,269
It's important.

1388
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:31,330
We're going to states like
Florida and Ohio

1389
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:33,000
and Michigan and Colorado,

1390
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:34,407
educating folks candidly

1391
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,968
on President Obama's
disastrous economic record

1392
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:38,912
and what folks
can do about it.

1393
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:44,343
If you want to look at how
Citizens United

1394
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:46,149
is warping politics,

1395
01:08:46,188 --> 01:08:49,589
there's no better place to
look than the state level.

1396
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:53,823
We're not only vulnerable
from this onslaught of money,

1397
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:58,027
we have less ability to know who
these corporate spenders are

1398
01:08:58,067 --> 01:09:02,527
and where they get the funds to
pay for all this electioneering.

1399
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:03,595
Here's a phone for you.

1400
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,436
Hannah will tell you how
to get into the system.

1401
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:06,600
Hi, this is Jeremy.

1402
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,872
I'm a volunteer for
Americans for Prosperity.

1403
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:10,936
I just want us to let you
know that Mayor Tom Barrett

1404
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,607
has raised taxes in Milwaukee

1405
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:15,208
every year but once
since he became mayor.

1406
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,014
Do you believe that Wisconsin...

1407
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:19,486
Governor Walker has saved
Wisconsin taxpayers...

1408
01:09:19,522 --> 01:09:20,511
Thank you very
much for your time.

1409
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:23,150
I urge you to go to
Americans for Prosperity...

1410
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:25,183
Do you think in the post
Citizens United world,

1411
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:26,990
you have more freedom
to do what you have?

1412
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:28,826
No. It doesn't
impact us at all,

1413
01:09:28,864 --> 01:09:31,799
we don't do election advocacy.

1414
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:32,596
Really?

1415
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:34,159
Again, the Citizens United

1416
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:36,933
did not impacts
Americans for Prosperity

1417
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:38,496
in no way, shape or form.

1418
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,771
This is not election advocacy?

1419
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:45,280
We're an issue group

1420
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:47,646
and we want to make sure
that Wisconsin citizens,

1421
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,310
they've heard
our side of the story.

1422
01:09:49,351 --> 01:09:51,683
But what about your
corporate funders?

1423
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,620
Isn't AFPjust another way
for them to get money

1424
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:55,351
into elections?

1425
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:57,382
Yeah, well we don't
discuss our funding,

1426
01:09:57,426 --> 01:09:59,326
but we're...

1427
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:01,124
Yeah, I know it's time...

1428
01:10:01,163 --> 01:10:03,154
We don't discuss our funding.

1429
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:11,235
I think this recall process
has really torn people apart.

1430
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:12,831
I'm worried we're going to
wreck the American way

1431
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:14,365
by changing up the system.

1432
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,640
Walker was voted in by
the people of Wisconsin.

1433
01:10:16,679 --> 01:10:18,670
End the recall madness,

1434
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:21,239
vote for Scott Walker,
June 5th.

1435
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:39,099
I don't want big money
from out of state

1436
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:43,571
with a slick ad influencing me.

1437
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:46,370
I consider myself a fairly
intelligent human being

1438
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:51,746
and I can figure things
out for myself.

1439
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:00,218
You up for petting today?

1440
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:08,257
I always thought the Republican
Party was a part of the people,

1441
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:11,027
the common man

1442
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:13,034
and that's what I am

1443
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:15,298
and that's why I
voted Republican.

1444
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:22,366
I don't think the party
represents

1445
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:24,572
what it used to represent.

1446
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:29,309
The most important thing that
Republican Party stands for

1447
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:35,586
that I will support and always
agree with is the right to life.

1448
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:42,327
And yet, on both ends
of the life span,

1449
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:44,924
they're doing things like
taking healthcare

1450
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,935
away from the children,

1451
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:49,802
they are taking healthcare
away from the senior citizens.

1452
01:11:49,838 --> 01:11:52,636
I've gone over and
over and over

1453
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:56,406
in my mind and in my heart,

1454
01:11:56,445 --> 01:11:58,845
about what I need
to do at this time

1455
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:05,312
that I can square
with my conscience.

1456
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:11,825
It's been a long, tough,
decision-making process.

1457
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:16,692
I'll do some thinking
and praying tonight.

1458
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:19,098
That's how seriously I take it.

1459
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:26,441
And Tea Party
actually flew me out here,

1460
01:12:26,475 --> 01:12:29,000
a beautiful airport
you guys got.

1461
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:32,309
I tell you, I think we hit two
ducks and a cow on the way in.

1462
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:36,215
God bless this country,
I love this country.

1463
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:38,048
I noticed there's
no dogs around here though,

1464
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:39,281
I didn't see any dogs here.

1465
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:41,448
Obama had been around lately?

1466
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,485
Huh?

1467
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:47,794
What do you think
he frightens me?

1468
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:49,297
Yeah, he don't scare me.
Yeah, what happened to him?

1469
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:51,390
I don't know, it looked
like a heart attack.

1470
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:54,166
Our election system
ain't working

1471
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,296
because the unions
control so much of it.

1472
01:12:56,338 --> 01:13:04,109
They actually contributed
from 1 989 to 201 1 election, 1 0.

1473
01:13:04,146 --> 01:13:09,846
And Public Employees Union
donated $465 million

1474
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:14,720
and the Koch brothers donated
1 2 million something.

1475
01:13:14,757 --> 01:13:19,353
Koch brothers are donating 400
million in this election cycle.

1476
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:20,828
- Who is?
- The Koch brothers.

1477
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:22,524
Four hundred million.

1478
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:23,963
How do you know that?

1479
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:24,693
Read it in paper.

1480
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,564
Well, you read it the paper,
OK.

1481
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:30,470
Here! See the back,
see what this says here.

1482
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:31,734
You know George Soros owns

1483
01:13:31,774 --> 01:13:34,334
the three major
broadcasting companies.

1484
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:38,506
The chairman of the campaign
to defeat Barack Obama

1485
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:39,912
Lloyd Marcus.

1486
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:47,411
I am not an African-American.

1487
01:13:47,456 --> 01:13:51,017
I am Lloyd Marcus, American!

1488
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:58,257
Oh look.
I have a photo ID.

1489
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:02,566
So that confirms that black
people are not too stupid

1490
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:06,700
to find their way
to get a photo ID.

1491
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:10,269
This is why we have to
vote this racist,

1492
01:14:10,312 --> 01:14:13,748
divisive administration
out of here.

1493
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:15,909
* *

1494
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:19,409
* We can't go Barrack,
back, back, back, back

1495
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:22,219
* It's too late

1496
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:25,021
* We're stuck with this
Hussein-us

1497
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,756
* And his spending
trillion state

1498
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:31,126
* Our children and our
grandchildren

1499
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:33,726
* They never will forget

1500
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:36,795
* How we sold out
for a little change

1501
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:40,570
* And left them all in debt

1502
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:46,411
* We can't go Barrack,
back, back baaaaak

1503
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,948
Madison!

1504
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:57,618
You know, the days of the
liberals of the left

1505
01:14:57,659 --> 01:14:59,593
having this massive
infrastructure

1506
01:14:59,628 --> 01:15:01,994
that overwhelms us are over.

1507
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:03,725
It's a new day.

1508
01:15:05,467 --> 01:15:09,665
Today, you are the
model for the country.

1509
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:13,141
And what we're saying in
Wisconsin through the Tea Party

1510
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:16,633
and Americans for Prosperity
and everyone else in all of you,

1511
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:20,239
we're saying to every Governor
and every state legislator,

1512
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:23,774
if you do the right thing,
we got your back,

1513
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:25,013
we'll be there for you.

1514
01:15:25,053 --> 01:15:26,816
We'll deliver the
message with you.

1515
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,153
Frankly, we'll raise the money
and it takes a lot of it,

1516
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:32,422
but we'll raise it, and we'll
put up TV ads and radio ads.

1517
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:34,019
We've got your back.

1518
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:41,862
- Caitlin.
- Yup.

1519
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:45,271
Could you write down
the numbers on the map,

1520
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:46,865
To like, by the street
that they're on?

1521
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,774
No, sweetheart we're on
South Street.

1522
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:49,276
Okay.

1523
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:51,211
Reminding you about
the recall election...

1524
01:15:51,246 --> 01:15:52,372
Yeah.

1525
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:53,711
You're all good then?

1526
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:54,807
Yeah, we're good.

1527
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:55,646
Hit the road.

1528
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:58,346
Oh, he's like keep going.
Yeah, hit the road.

1529
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:00,116
- Did he really said that?
- Yeah.

1530
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:03,287
Remind you to get out
and vote on Tuesday.

1531
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:04,383
Just remind him to vote.

1532
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:05,791
Don't forget.

1533
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:07,351
- We're going to vote.
- Thanks.

1534
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,162
I'm a disabled veteran.

1535
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:10,687
I can't get a damn thing.

1536
01:16:10,732 --> 01:16:13,223
My mortgage payment
is 1 1 00 a month here.

1537
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:14,997
These people down at Madison
are just not responsible.

1538
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:15,526
Exactly.

1539
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:17,471
I can't even go to
McDonald's and eat.

1540
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:19,235
They've broken
faith with the people.

1541
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:20,832
Hey, get out and vote,
get out and vote.

1542
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:22,707
This is our opportunity to
turn this thing around.

1543
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:23,972
OK, thank you.

1544
01:16:24,012 --> 01:16:26,207
We forget where
the real power is.

1545
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,648
You know, you could be
living in a cardboard box

1546
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:30,413
underneath the highway somewhere

1547
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:33,853
and you at one moment
in time have as much power

1548
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:36,323
as the guy down the street
living in the mansion.

1549
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:38,019
And that's when you go to vote.

1550
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,323
I said all my life,
I wouldn't vote,

1551
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:42,523
I wouldn't lower myself
to their crap.

1552
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:45,465
But John,
this one is important.

1553
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,832
I figured if I don't vote,
I'd be pissed off

1554
01:16:47,869 --> 01:16:50,531
if that idiot gets
in there, so...

1555
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:53,871
My biggest concern is that the
first time I get you to vote,

1556
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:56,969
it's a darn Democrat, oh!

1557
01:16:57,012 --> 01:16:58,070
You have to
show me how to vote,

1558
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:00,081
I don't know what's going on.

1559
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:12,653
Hi there.

1560
01:17:12,694 --> 01:17:13,922
Hello.

1561
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:15,595
- My very first time.
- He needs to register...

1562
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:18,896
This is a historical moment.
I've never voted in my life.

1563
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:20,492
Well, it's never too late.

1564
01:17:20,535 --> 01:17:22,560
- And there's my
driver's license.
- OK.

1565
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:26,405
I think that's a Labrador hair
hanging on that there.

1566
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,574
Just the two X's
on this page is it?

1567
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:32,102
Yeah.

1568
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:35,173
I don't want to mess it up
now that I've decided to do it.

1569
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:39,417
Lick the envelope and...

1570
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:44,789
I am a voter.

1571
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:46,350
You are a voter.

1572
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:49,728
At least that's one more thing
my ma can be proud of in my 50s.

1573
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:50,390
Exactly.

1574
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:51,956
- It makes my mother
happy because I've...
- Exactly.

1575
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,560
She didn't think she'd lived
long enough to see you vote.

1576
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:59,233
So this is where I would
vote for president, huh?

1577
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:01,299
Oh, I might vote then too?

1578
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:10,482
One of my earliest Sunday school
lessons was taught

1579
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:13,977
by my baby sister, Brenda.

1580
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:18,982
She said Gwen,
God loves everyone.

1581
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:23,555
And just because God made me
pretty and made you ugly

1582
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:27,295
that doesn't mean that
God doesn't love you.

1583
01:18:27,335 --> 01:18:31,999
Election day must be a very
frightening day for people

1584
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:36,170
who are very wealthy
or very handsome.

1585
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:39,647
You know, to know
that on this one day

1586
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:42,809
you are no better than your
brother or your sister

1587
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:44,318
and you have the same rights.

1588
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:47,788
And so I urge each
one of you all

1589
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:50,291
to exercise this precious right.

1590
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:51,587
If it weren't so precious,

1591
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:53,116
they wouldn't be trying
to take it from us,

1592
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:54,287
isn't that right,

1593
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:56,160
ain't that right,
Reverend Briscoe?

1594
01:18:56,198 --> 01:19:01,932
So, if no other reason
but just to be ornery

1595
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:04,939
and to deny them the right
to disenfranchise...

1596
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:07,965
I voted because you
didn't want me to vote.

1597
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,842
Vote because they
don't want you to vote.

1598
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:27,152
Hurrah.

1599
01:19:27,195 --> 01:19:28,628
We win.

1600
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,966
All right.
Have a good day.

1601
01:19:38,006 --> 01:19:39,496
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1602
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:45,673
I made up my mind
about 5:30 this morning.

1603
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:49,851
And how do you feel
about your decision?

1604
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:52,877
It's a decision I can live with

1605
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:57,881
and it's a decision between
me, my God and my country

1606
01:19:57,926 --> 01:20:02,488
and God bless America

1607
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:06,262
and Wisconsin motto is
"Forward"

1608
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:09,270
and regardless of the
outcome today

1609
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,204
we do have to move forward.

1610
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:42,201
Another day.

1611
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:45,104
Another day as an employee
of the state of Wisconsin.

1612
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:49,743
Go to work.
Try not to get stabbed.

1613
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:52,439
Try to pay attention.

1614
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,948
Try to pay attention
to what matters.

1615
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:59,453
It was stolen by
all that big money

1616
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:05,684
and the rest of the America,
they're coming for you next.

1617
01:21:09,631 --> 01:21:12,566
Please welcome,
Governor Scott Walker.

1618
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:39,589
By carrying Ohio,
Wisconsin.

1619
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:41,721
Michigan, Pennsylvania.

1620
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:45,927
61%% of union households
backs the president last night.

1621
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:49,061
Can we say labor delivered
President Obama's second term?

1622
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:52,938
Labor absolutely delivered
President Obama's second term.

1623
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:55,340
We should not all go home
and start celebrating.

1624
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:57,174
The last time we did that,

1625
01:21:57,212 --> 01:22:02,343
I put on my rhinestones
and my black gown,

1626
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:06,343
sweeping the floor and
they went into the war room

1627
01:22:06,388 --> 01:22:08,618
and plan to defeat
this president

1628
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:12,525
on that very day
that we were dancing.

1629
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:18,465
So I'm telling you,
all the chicken wings are gone,

1630
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,526
all the Doritos have been eaten,

1631
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:23,127
let's get to work.

1632
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:34,281
Hey! Hey!

1633
01:22:36,918 --> 01:22:39,284
Organized labor's
suffered a defeat today.

1634
01:22:39,321 --> 01:22:42,552
Michigan became the
24th right-to-work state.

1635
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:45,388
That causes union members to
decline that means fewer dues,

1636
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:47,520
that means less money
for political actions.

1637
01:22:47,562 --> 01:22:49,996
Launched in partnership
with the same guys

1638
01:22:50,031 --> 01:22:52,499
who bank rolled
Governor Walker's campaign

1639
01:22:52,534 --> 01:22:54,331
to undermine workers' rights.

1640
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:57,031
We fight these battles
on taxes and regulations,

1641
01:22:57,072 --> 01:22:59,302
but really what we
would like to see is to

1642
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:01,309
take the unions out at the knee

1643
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:04,005
so they don't have the resources
to fight these battles.

1644
01:23:04,045 --> 01:23:05,569
Who's paying your salary?

1645
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:07,376
I work for Americans for
Prosperity or a non-profit...

1646
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:08,814
Who's paying your salary?

1647
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:11,216
Americans for Prosperity
I told you we're a non-profit

1648
01:23:11,252 --> 01:23:14,050
just like the Red Cross,
just like any other nonprofit.

1649
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:16,383
* *

1650
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:39,736
PBS has been accused of
scuttling a documentary called

1651
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:41,271
Citizen Koch

1652
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:44,911
because they feared the
reaction from David Koch.

1653
01:23:44,953 --> 01:23:49,219
I guess for a donation of $75
you get the PBS tote bag

1654
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:52,988
and for 23 million,
you get the PBS's nut sack.

1655
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:54,825
* *
