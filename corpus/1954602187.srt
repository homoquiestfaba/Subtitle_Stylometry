1
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,697
It's your birthday!

2
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:37,958
Go Treasure!

3
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,893
Where the hell y'all think y'all at?

4
00:00:53,727 --> 00:00:57,065
Treasure. Got that paperwork
for your transfer.

5
00:00:57,148 --> 00:00:59,777
-I ain't sleepy yet.
-Me neither.

6
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,032
Back to your bunks!

7
00:01:06,452 --> 00:01:07,578
Move!

8
00:01:09,914 --> 00:01:12,251
You're gonna be all on your own tomorrow.

9
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:14,629
State Women's Facility?

10
00:01:14,962 --> 00:01:18,342
I tell you, I wouldn't work
in that motherfucker for nothing.

11
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:20,135
My moms is in there.

12
00:01:21,512 --> 00:01:22,805
Serious?

13
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:26,226
She doin' life.

14
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,858
I ain't never met her. Just pictures.

15
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:37,282
-Damn, why ain't you never said nothin'?
-Never knew.

16
00:01:41,788 --> 00:01:43,957
-Remember Shadow?
-Yeah.

17
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:48,045
-She got transferred to State last year.
-She got me word.

18
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:53,969
Motherfucker. So that's what
your stabbin' Takisha was all about?

19
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,598
You tryin' to get up in there?

20
00:01:57,307 --> 00:01:59,560
I ain't tryin' shit, Leonard.

21
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,354
It's done.

22
00:02:04,483 --> 00:02:06,110
I'm goin' home.

23
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:46,827
Treasure Lee?

24
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:00,845
Happy birthday.

25
00:03:41,103 --> 00:03:43,440
-Gate open.
-Transfers coming in.

26
00:03:55,288 --> 00:03:58,208
All right, ladies, step on through the door.

27
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,836
Line up on the green line, facing the glass.

28
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,088
Quickly!

29
00:04:02,463 --> 00:04:04,174
Toes on the line!

30
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:05,592
Drop your bags.

31
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:20,319
You've all been legally sentenced
to pay your debt to society...

32
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:23,448
...here at the State Facility for Women.

33
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:26,285
We have some rules for you to learn.

34
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:30,749
Inmates, that is you, are required to obey
all written and verbal orders...

35
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,168
...given by any staff member.

36
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:37,340
Smoking is not permitted in any building...

37
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:39,468
...except in the unit day room.

38
00:04:39,843 --> 00:04:41,721
All out of the showers.

39
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:44,891
Inmates are not permitted
to enter any housing unit...

40
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:47,728
...to which they are not assigned.

41
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:49,606
Physical contact...

42
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:53,986
...physical displays of affection, horseplay,
or sexual activities of any kind...

43
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,951
...between inmates, employees, visitors,
or volunteers is prohibited.

44
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,203
Treasure Lee?

45
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,624
Your number is 2879.
You answer to that during the count.

46
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:07,294
You put it on all your stuff.
You understand?

47
00:05:10,465 --> 00:05:11,550
Open your mouth.

48
00:05:11,633 --> 00:05:16,556
Inmates will not interfere with any staff
member in the performance of their duties.

49
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:21,395
Hands.

50
00:05:22,397 --> 00:05:26,735
A disrespectful gesture,
30 days in disciplinary confinement.

51
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:28,780
-Tanya Pierce?
-Yes, sir. Do I...

52
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:32,743
Your number is 2880.
You answer to that during the count.

53
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:34,745
You put it on all your stuff. Understand?

54
00:05:35,496 --> 00:05:38,458
Participating in,
or inciting a minor disturbance...

55
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,420
...30 days in disciplinary confinement.

56
00:05:41,587 --> 00:05:43,506
Okay, bend over.

57
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:45,259
Bend over.

58
00:05:45,384 --> 00:05:47,887
Possession of escape paraphernalia...

59
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:50,932
...60 days in disciplinary confinement.

60
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:54,520
You can't use that same thing on all of us.

61
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,357
This would be an example
of interfering with an officer...

62
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,361
...in the performance of her duty.
-But it's not sterile.

63
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:04,074
You're right.
The doctor'll be in tomorrow morning...

64
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:06,285
...we can check you in then.

65
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:10,081
In the meantime,
why don't you spend the night in the Hole?

66
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:12,125
Frank, get in here.

67
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:16,256
We got a princess checking in.
Put her in disciplinary for the night.

68
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:20,511
My advice to you, girls, do your own time.

69
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:24,641
Don't bother other prisoners
or try to break a badge. It'll only backfire.

70
00:06:24,725 --> 00:06:26,936
Just mind your own business...

71
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,105
...not your neighbor's.

72
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:32,484
Try to work your program
to reduce your sentence.

73
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:35,154
Lee?

74
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,325
You take the white girl's bag,
she's your roommate.

75
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,329
Let's go! Move it out.

76
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,734
All right, ladies, new fish.

77
00:07:10,198 --> 00:07:12,034
You're on the floor.

78
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:18,250
COs don't like it much
when we try to spruce up the place.

79
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:22,046
My daughter gave this to me.
It's some kind of violet.

80
00:07:22,213 --> 00:07:25,384
She's working on my case.
Gonna get me out of here.

81
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:36,398
See, I told you she'd be black, praise Jesus.

82
00:07:36,398 --> 00:07:38,567
See, I told you she'd be black, praise Jesus.

83
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:40,778
-So who sleeps on top?
-Me.

84
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:44,658
You don't think I'm gonna let Mama Cass
climb up over me every night, do you?

85
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:48,413
I'm Doodle. Doodle Aldridge.

86
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:49,748
So?

87
00:07:54,837 --> 00:07:57,382
You must've transferred
from the Youth Authority, right?

88
00:07:57,466 --> 00:08:01,220
All y'all young girls got attitude all day,
ain't got nothin' upstairs.

89
00:08:01,304 --> 00:08:02,639
Whatever.

90
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:05,768
I'll check you threes later!

91
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:08,438
Ladies!

92
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:12,025
New fish.

93
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:14,862
Yo. Double G!

94
00:08:15,613 --> 00:08:17,616
Sister, my sister.

95
00:08:18,116 --> 00:08:21,496
You know you need to come over here
and get this mattress next to me.

96
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:23,999
Yo, I wasn't studyin' no floor.

97
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:25,876
You'll learn.

98
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:29,255
Come over here, sit next to me.

99
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,511
That's right.

100
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:37,474
You can put some of your stuff
in that locker over there.

101
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:41,270
That ain't mine. Some white girl
got sent up the Hole right off.

102
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,814
Is that right?

103
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:48,988
But I was watchin' it.

104
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,409
Ever.

105
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,915
The name's Leisha.

106
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,709
Hip.hop geisha.

107
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,836
I'm about to be up out
in six months anyway...

108
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,381
...back in the studio, laying tracks.

109
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:05,551
Yeah, all right.

110
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,513
So what, I gotta ask
for your name, or what?

111
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:11,475
Treasure.

112
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:16,523
So, you straight? Everything okay?

113
00:09:16,606 --> 00:09:19,151
-Meet everybody?
-Yeah, except...

114
00:09:20,987 --> 00:09:24,366
That's Patrice. She's a Xanax zombie.

115
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:27,703
Depressed. Trying to sleep her way
through her nickel.

116
00:09:29,914 --> 00:09:32,918
-You know a sister named Shadow?
-Shadow?

117
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:35,004
That's my girl.

118
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:38,550
-Was you from East Side?
-We was up in Youth together.

119
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:40,344
Okay.

120
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:42,889
Check this out, baby girl.

121
00:09:42,972 --> 00:09:45,017
This here ain't the same.

122
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:48,563
As long as you remember that,
you'll be all right.

123
00:09:51,441 --> 00:09:52,735
Yo.

124
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:55,029
You know a lifer named Brownie?

125
00:09:55,154 --> 00:09:58,951
Shit, girl, don't ask me nothin'
'bout no Brownie.

126
00:09:59,243 --> 00:10:03,415
I'm about gettin' up out of here
in six months, I ain't about no Brownie.

127
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:06,168
Besides, she up in Unit A anyway.

128
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:10,632
Damn.

129
00:10:10,715 --> 00:10:14,220
Every time that go off,
you got two minutes before line up.

130
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:15,430
Yeah.

131
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,904
Yo, Shadow!

132
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:31,950
Girl! What's up?

133
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:33,369
You made it!

134
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,874
Happy birthday! Sorry I missed that shit.

135
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:39,877
Count!

136
00:10:40,002 --> 00:10:43,506
-Leisha, you take care of my girl, now.
-I was gonna.

137
00:10:44,007 --> 00:10:45,926
-I'll see you in the morning.
-All right.

138
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,929
On the line, ladies.

139
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,103
Cell 3!

140
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,897
4437.

141
00:10:56,022 --> 00:10:57,482
6293.

142
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:58,859
4527.

143
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:01,237
-3820.
-Cell 2!

144
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:03,239
2477.

145
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:04,783
834.

146
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:06,660
1537.

147
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:08,538
2542.

148
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:11,041
-2879.
-Cell 1.

149
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,710
4187.

150
00:11:12,876 --> 00:11:14,211
6289.

151
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:15,630
1787.

152
00:11:15,713 --> 00:11:17,466
1642.

153
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:20,177
Count clear.

154
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,856
My sister.

155
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:37,699
You know I was only kiddin'
about you bein' trouble, right?

156
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,453
You want some, Doodle?

157
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:42,872
I'll take it if you givin'.

158
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:46,210
Wait a minute,
you know how much they go for in here?

159
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:49,255
Yo, me and Shadow used to sell 'em
for $5 a cup up at Youth.

160
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,885
$5? Here they be charging $8,
sometimes $10.

161
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:59,435
Some girls do a little bit of anything
for a Cup of Noodles, baby.

162
00:11:59,602 --> 00:12:01,646
Let me have a bite, Doodle.

163
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:08,947
Here.

164
00:12:09,823 --> 00:12:12,284
You can have the whole cup and more.

165
00:12:12,618 --> 00:12:15,038
After you move to the floor.

166
00:12:21,045 --> 00:12:22,088
Deal.

167
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:24,508
What the fuck is this?

168
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,803
-Open 2.
-On the gate.

169
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:42,655
-Where did that come from?
-I don't know.

170
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,200
You don't know.

171
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,926
Let's go.

172
00:12:59,218 --> 00:13:01,262
Come on, move your ass.

173
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,549
You ain't dead yet?

174
00:15:13,427 --> 00:15:15,805
You ain't got no Momma/

175
00:15:39,376 --> 00:15:41,879
After this, we go into the yard.

176
00:15:41,963 --> 00:15:45,008
Unless you got something hooked up
for you over there.

177
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:48,012
-All right. Lookin' forward to that shit.
-Okay.

178
00:15:48,221 --> 00:15:50,265
Down there's the commissary.

179
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,768
Downstairs is the cafeteria.

180
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,104
Over here...

181
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,274
...library.

182
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,861
Computer room, books,
you know, shit like that.

183
00:16:01,696 --> 00:16:05,451
That's Miss Johnny Cochran.
She knows a lot about legal shit.

184
00:16:06,285 --> 00:16:08,413
And she also run a group therapy session.

185
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:10,749
All fresh fish got to attend that.

186
00:16:10,832 --> 00:16:12,501
Fuck that.

187
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,170
It's mandatory, Treasure.

188
00:16:14,253 --> 00:16:17,090
She's the only one that can pass you out.

189
00:16:17,591 --> 00:16:19,677
We can take vocational classes.

190
00:16:19,844 --> 00:16:22,597
I'm reading and shit.
You should check it out.

191
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:24,600
You get saved up in here?

192
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,854
Yo, you gotta work your program.
You stay outta the mix.

193
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:31,608
Every day you take a class
or you work up in prison industry...

194
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:34,362
...you get a day off your sentence.
-Whatever.

195
00:16:34,654 --> 00:16:37,407
Okay. We just left Administration.

196
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,952
Now, Unit A is on top.

197
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,537
It's lifers.

198
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:43,039
Bad-ass criminals.

199
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:47,795
That's where Brownie lives.

200
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:52,009
Yeah.

201
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:55,597
But we second floor, we Unit B, we G.girls.

202
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,815
Unit C is in the basement.

203
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:07,069
That's the Hole. Crazies. Old fucks.

204
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:11,909
Yo, what's up with that shit?

205
00:17:12,242 --> 00:17:15,580
-I know. And he a married fucker, too!
-Shit.

206
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:22,756
-Hello, Fluffy.
-That's Sugar.

207
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:25,175
The gang girl's doorknob.

208
00:17:25,884 --> 00:17:28,846
Everybody gets a turn.

209
00:17:28,888 --> 00:17:30,724
Shadow, what you said about me?

210
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,312
I know you ain't talkin' about me to this...
Where did you come from?

211
00:17:34,437 --> 00:17:37,691
You know what? Please, Sugar.
Make a fist.

212
00:17:49,873 --> 00:17:51,542
That's Brownie.

213
00:17:53,502 --> 00:17:55,380
You down with Brownie?

214
00:17:55,547 --> 00:17:58,342
Why you always gotta play
for somebody new? I'm right here.

215
00:17:58,383 --> 00:18:00,302
You just so tame.

216
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:34,428
Can't play no ball?

217
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:41,396
Yeah!

218
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,151
All right!

219
00:19:11,224 --> 00:19:13,728
Told you 'bout playin' ball with me.

220
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:16,898
It knocks the wind out of you.

221
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:20,319
Somebody come play with us
before I get upset.

222
00:19:22,447 --> 00:19:23,907
I'm gonna get you.

223
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,538
That's me.

224
00:19:28,663 --> 00:19:31,250
Treasure, what you doin'?
Girl, you cannot play ball.

225
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,210
Shadow, hold my shit.

226
00:19:33,461 --> 00:19:35,296
-You can play?
-Yeah.

227
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:37,132
Come the fuck on.

228
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:39,260
Fuck up off me.

229
00:19:41,888 --> 00:19:43,515
That's all right!

230
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:00,620
That's all right.

231
00:20:11,091 --> 00:20:12,676
What's up with that?

232
00:20:13,678 --> 00:20:15,805
-Bitch.
-Let's go, guys, let's go.

233
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:19,018
You got it, she ain't got nothing.

234
00:20:33,744 --> 00:20:37,874
Cut the nonsense! I don't give a damn!
I said, "Cut the nonsense!"

235
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,586
I ain't gonna let you two bitches
fuck up my court time.

236
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,672
You heard Moms,
what the fuck is your problem?

237
00:20:42,756 --> 00:20:45,467
-You my problem, cracker bitch!
-Cracker?

238
00:20:45,592 --> 00:20:47,929
-Get out of my face!
-Nigger called me cracker!

239
00:20:48,012 --> 00:20:50,557
I don't give a fuck! I said cut it out!

240
00:21:00,111 --> 00:21:01,946
What's your name, girl?

241
00:21:02,655 --> 00:21:05,284
Treasure. Treasure Lee.

242
00:21:08,287 --> 00:21:10,415
All right, Treasure Lee.

243
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:12,793
Next time, you play for us.

244
00:21:14,462 --> 00:21:16,047
We'll kick ass.

245
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:49,005
Okay, guys, let's settle in! Thank you.

246
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:51,341
Thank you very much.

247
00:21:51,425 --> 00:21:54,303
I been doing time since I can remember.

248
00:21:54,846 --> 00:21:58,892
You know, 16, first trip to Juvenile.

249
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:04,191
I didn't go straight from Juvenile to prison,
I went home and...

250
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:07,403
...committed another offense
to bring me here.

251
00:22:08,446 --> 00:22:11,450
-I'm dealing with it.
-I'm a multi.violator.

252
00:22:12,368 --> 00:22:15,038
I started doing time in 1959...

253
00:22:15,121 --> 00:22:17,749
...and I went straight to a Federal pen.

254
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:20,920
There was no Youth Authority
or none of that stuff.

255
00:22:21,087 --> 00:22:23,256
A group of gals
got a hold of me and schooled me.

256
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,925
I learned how to do time.

257
00:22:25,008 --> 00:22:27,720
I did time until I was 38 years old.

258
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,432
After all the time I was out,
I started using again.

259
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,394
Ended up back in the streets
and back in the system.

260
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:36,523
When I came in here,
I was going down on somebody for $5...

261
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:39,777
...and I thought he got cheated.
That's how I felt about myself.

262
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:43,323
I can promise you,
you keep coming back to this fucker here...

263
00:22:44,157 --> 00:22:47,620
...you're gonna end up,
if you live long enough to get this old...

264
00:22:47,703 --> 00:22:49,372
...that's all there is out there.

265
00:22:49,456 --> 00:22:50,832
I'm not fuckin' angry.

266
00:22:50,874 --> 00:22:52,751
You keep asking me that. I'm not angry.

267
00:22:52,835 --> 00:22:55,296
I was 16 years old with two fuckin' kids...

268
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,841
...begging for help,
and know what you told me?

269
00:22:57,883 --> 00:23:00,720
"Just wait." How fuckin' long could I wait?

270
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,975
These girls got a chance and you'll
sit there and blow smoke up their ass?

271
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,519
Don't try that shit.

272
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,028
I don't think nothing.

273
00:23:16,865 --> 00:23:18,575
I ain't got nothing to say.

274
00:23:19,994 --> 00:23:22,789
I'm not like these other females in here.

275
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:40,061
Let's make this game interesting.

276
00:23:40,561 --> 00:23:42,105
Let's start a kitty.

277
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,942
Hell, no. No betting and no gambling.

278
00:23:45,234 --> 00:23:47,862
I only got six months left
up in this motherfucker.

279
00:23:47,945 --> 00:23:49,864
I ain't about fuckin' up my time.

280
00:23:49,948 --> 00:23:51,950
Yeah, we know.

281
00:23:53,035 --> 00:23:55,246
I wasn't talking to you anyway, Leisha.

282
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,040
I was talking to Sugar.

283
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:58,917
Here we go.

284
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,962
You know I'm a player.

285
00:24:01,129 --> 00:24:02,839
I'm down for it all.

286
00:24:02,964 --> 00:24:04,550
Ain't that right, Shadow?

287
00:24:05,092 --> 00:24:08,471
Can we play cards,
and y'all do that foreplay shit later?

288
00:24:08,763 --> 00:24:09,931
Later when?

289
00:24:10,098 --> 00:24:12,726
Why don't y'all give us a little privacy?

290
00:24:15,063 --> 00:24:17,315
You like a dangerous type, huh?

291
00:24:20,027 --> 00:24:22,238
I see why they call you Sugar.

292
00:24:22,322 --> 00:24:25,075
'Cause you like brown sugar.

293
00:24:26,702 --> 00:24:28,454
You all sweet and shit.

294
00:24:31,124 --> 00:24:32,501
Excuse me.

295
00:24:33,502 --> 00:24:35,713
Are y'all supposed to be in here?

296
00:24:39,134 --> 00:24:40,344
Shit.

297
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:41,512
What?

298
00:24:41,804 --> 00:24:44,224
Someone I do not wanna see tonight.

299
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,146
What you doing?

300
00:24:48,479 --> 00:24:50,649
I'm playing cards. What you doing?

301
00:24:51,024 --> 00:24:52,693
You know what I'm doing.

302
00:24:52,776 --> 00:24:55,989
I'm sitting in the back of the church
waiting for your black ass.

303
00:24:56,072 --> 00:24:58,283
I ain't about meeting you there every night.

304
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:00,161
I never said we were exclusive.

305
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,206
Maybe she found something
a little sweeter.

306
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:04,875
You know what they say.

307
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,003
"The darker the berry..."

308
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,052
You can go back to the asshole
you crawled from, bitch.

309
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,346
-Excuse me?
-I said...

310
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,394
A fight! A fight!

311
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:22,147
A nigger and a white!

312
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:25,234
White can't fight,
'cause the nigger's all right!

313
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:26,610
A fight! A fight!

314
00:25:26,736 --> 00:25:28,154
A nigger and a white!

315
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:30,949
The white can't fight,
'cause the nigger's all right!

316
00:25:35,872 --> 00:25:37,040
Fuck!

317
00:25:37,207 --> 00:25:38,417
You bitch!

318
00:25:40,628 --> 00:25:42,464
Get away! Break it up!

319
00:25:42,922 --> 00:25:44,257
Enough!

320
00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:46,218
Back it off.

321
00:25:52,226 --> 00:25:53,978
I'm not going in there!

322
00:25:54,103 --> 00:25:55,814
-Open the door.
-Fuck you.

323
00:25:56,648 --> 00:25:58,025
Open the door!

324
00:26:04,825 --> 00:26:06,368
You're dead, bitch.

325
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:10,874
Quiet!

326
00:26:11,875 --> 00:26:13,336
What's going on out there?

327
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:14,754
Fuck you!

328
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,262
Ain't nothin' in the Hole.

329
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:23,098
Welcome.

330
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:26,644
Welcome, girlfriend!

331
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:33,235
Yo! What's your name, baby?

332
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:48,171
Fuck.

333
00:26:53,636 --> 00:26:55,054
What's your name, girl?

334
00:26:56,056 --> 00:26:57,766
My name is Treasure.

335
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:01,521
Mom.

336
00:27:01,604 --> 00:27:03,482
Next time, you play for us.

337
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:06,485
Margaret "Brownie" Lee.

338
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,437
Treasure.

339
00:27:43,281 --> 00:27:44,908
It's me, Brownie.

340
00:27:46,535 --> 00:27:47,662
Yeah.

341
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:50,749
You a bold motherfucker, you know that?

342
00:27:50,832 --> 00:27:52,918
Fuckin' with my girl Kit.

343
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:56,172
I want you to come see me
when you get out.

344
00:27:56,965 --> 00:27:58,884
I got a feeling about you.

345
00:27:59,343 --> 00:28:01,012
What kind of feeling?

346
00:28:08,229 --> 00:28:09,731
"Bold motherfucker."

347
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:11,358
Damn straight.

348
00:28:15,238 --> 00:28:17,032
"What's your name, girl?"

349
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:20,119
"My name is Treasure."

350
00:28:20,912 --> 00:28:22,580
"Treasure Lee."

351
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:32,426
I'll see you when I get out.

352
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:45,067
519.

353
00:28:45,192 --> 00:28:46,360
4437.

354
00:28:46,485 --> 00:28:47,612
6293.

355
00:28:47,695 --> 00:28:48,738
4527.

356
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,948
3820.

357
00:28:50,115 --> 00:28:50,949
Cell 2.

358
00:28:51,033 --> 00:28:52,284
2477.

359
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:53,411
834.

360
00:28:53,494 --> 00:28:54,871
1537.

361
00:28:55,246 --> 00:28:56,748
2880.

362
00:28:56,957 --> 00:28:58,375
2542.

363
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:00,086
2879.

364
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:01,254
Cell 1.

365
00:29:01,295 --> 00:29:02,505
6289.

366
00:29:02,589 --> 00:29:03,882
1737.

367
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:05,092
1642.

368
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,761
Count clear.

369
00:29:11,934 --> 00:29:14,646
What's the best way to get to Unit A?

370
00:29:14,896 --> 00:29:16,314
Unit A?

371
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:19,318
Girl, you just got out of the Hole,
30 days, fool.

372
00:29:19,485 --> 00:29:23,365
I ain't ask you what you thought about it.
How do I get there?

373
00:29:30,624 --> 00:29:32,001
Hook me up.

374
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:39,301
Tag, too.

375
00:30:06,794 --> 00:30:08,755
Can we please just play?

376
00:30:09,381 --> 00:30:11,175
Baby wants to play.

377
00:30:16,932 --> 00:30:18,517
Come on in, girl.

378
00:30:23,857 --> 00:30:25,192
What you want?

379
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:27,695
Beer? Wine cooler? Something harder?

380
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:31,658
I thought we was gonna talk.

381
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:34,871
Alone.

382
00:30:35,914 --> 00:30:37,374
We can talk in here.

383
00:30:38,083 --> 00:30:39,752
We all family here.

384
00:30:40,711 --> 00:30:42,464
This is my wife, Wee.

385
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:45,008
My daughters Kit and Scar.

386
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,596
So this "come see me" shit...

387
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,892
...ain't got nothing to do
with your being my fuckin' mother.

388
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,021
You jumping the gun now, girl.

389
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:57,733
You can't become a member
of the family overnight.

390
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,276
This ain't Juvie up in here.

391
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,489
I don't know what you're thinking, but...

392
00:31:02,739 --> 00:31:04,908
...you've got some auditioning to do.

393
00:31:05,284 --> 00:31:07,453
We got to get to know one another.

394
00:31:08,788 --> 00:31:11,625
I ain't about auditioning for nobody.

395
00:31:12,835 --> 00:31:16,214
I been getting to know you
for a long time, Moms.

396
00:31:16,423 --> 00:31:18,091
This nigger's tripping.

397
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:19,635
Shit.

398
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:21,971
Let me see that shit.

399
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:24,433
That ain't Brownie.

400
00:31:24,808 --> 00:31:26,686
Think we all look alike?

401
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:29,105
Shut up and give the girl back her picture.

402
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:35,405
I'll see y'all in the day room in a minute.

403
00:31:40,953 --> 00:31:42,122
Step.

404
00:31:51,967 --> 00:31:53,928
I never had no mother.

405
00:31:54,637 --> 00:31:57,307
I never had no family out there either.

406
00:31:58,183 --> 00:32:02,731
I came in here alone,
and I had to learn a lot of shit on my own.

407
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:04,983
And now so do you.

408
00:32:07,028 --> 00:32:09,280
I liked what I saw the other day.

409
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,910
So I invited you here to find out
who you were...

410
00:32:13,035 --> 00:32:14,871
...and to see what you got.

411
00:32:15,413 --> 00:32:18,876
But if you gonna be jumping the gun
and acting all crazy...

412
00:32:19,043 --> 00:32:21,212
I don't know what you heard, but...

413
00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:23,048
Jumping the gun?

414
00:32:23,381 --> 00:32:25,217
What the fuck you talking about?

415
00:32:25,342 --> 00:32:27,678
Do you see
I'm trying to tell you something?

416
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:30,098
I've been waiting a long time for this.

417
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,227
My whole damn life,
I've been waiting to find you.

418
00:32:33,394 --> 00:32:35,981
They're telling me I'm crazy
for liking it in here.

419
00:32:36,064 --> 00:32:38,359
For trying to get over here next to you.

420
00:32:38,651 --> 00:32:40,236
Fuck all that.

421
00:32:40,987 --> 00:32:43,406
This is all I know. Know what I'm saying?

422
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,743
I'm up in this motherfucker 'cause of you.

423
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,787
My flesh and blood.

424
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:51,375
Listen here, you crazy.ass bitch.

425
00:32:52,126 --> 00:32:54,629
I ain't got nothing to do with you.

426
00:32:55,422 --> 00:32:56,882
If you in here...

427
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,885
...you in here because of you
and nobody else.

428
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:02,722
I don't even know who the fuck you are.

429
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,060
So bounce.

430
00:33:10,816 --> 00:33:11,900
Now.

431
00:34:54,862 --> 00:34:57,240
I called you here to say I'm sorry.

432
00:34:58,242 --> 00:34:59,744
Fuck you, you sorry.

433
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,623
I am sorry, Treasure. I didn't know.

434
00:35:04,416 --> 00:35:07,378
They took you from me
the minute you were born.

435
00:35:12,134 --> 00:35:13,636
Why didn't you try?

436
00:35:14,762 --> 00:35:15,889
Listen.

437
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:19,226
I said I was sorry.

438
00:35:20,102 --> 00:35:22,731
That's what you wanted me to say, right?

439
00:35:23,774 --> 00:35:25,401
This isn't easy.

440
00:35:25,776 --> 00:35:26,861
So?

441
00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:29,030
I was dealing...

442
00:35:29,614 --> 00:35:32,743
...with so much anger
when I first rolled up.

443
00:35:33,286 --> 00:35:35,330
I had to get my head on straight.

444
00:35:35,413 --> 00:35:39,001
I had to find a way to do my time.

445
00:35:39,251 --> 00:35:41,254
How to do your time alone?

446
00:35:43,882 --> 00:35:45,134
You're right.

447
00:35:49,598 --> 00:35:51,141
I failed you.

448
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,502
Baby...

449
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,356
The difference between me
and most of these people in here...

450
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:39,360
...l'm playing ignorant,
and y'all are ignorant.

451
00:37:39,777 --> 00:37:43,490
Let me tell you something,
I got a degree in Business already.

452
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:46,118
Wait...

453
00:37:46,327 --> 00:37:47,537
Let her finish.

454
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,497
I wrote a script already.

455
00:37:49,956 --> 00:37:52,334
Hey, I might star in the motherfucker.

456
00:37:52,376 --> 00:37:55,338
What a Business degree got to do
with acting, motherfucker?

457
00:37:55,672 --> 00:37:58,008
What a Business degree got to do
with acting?

458
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,011
-Let me tell...
-Wait a minute.

459
00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:03,348
What a Business degree got to
with acting?

460
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:05,976
I have goals, but the thing is...

461
00:38:06,102 --> 00:38:08,688
...I don't want to just run
the streets anymore.

462
00:38:08,897 --> 00:38:11,567
I've been running the streets
for a long time.

463
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,112
And now I want the things
I said I never wanted.

464
00:38:14,195 --> 00:38:16,656
I never wanted to strive for normalcy.

465
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,575
Now I want a house.

466
00:38:18,701 --> 00:38:21,079
I want a car.
I want some of the simple things.

467
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,626
My dream is...

468
00:38:26,293 --> 00:38:29,548
I'm living it out. I'm getting with my mom.

469
00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:33,177
I want to get up out of here.

470
00:38:33,469 --> 00:38:35,805
Get us a place in the 'hood.

471
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,435
Get a fuckin' fly.ass truck.

472
00:38:40,102 --> 00:38:43,565
And just chill, and do our thing together.

473
00:38:46,611 --> 00:38:48,404
I want you to take it off.

474
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,129
-Are you Treasure?
-Yeah.

475
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:07,804
Grab the damn box, dumb shit.

476
00:39:09,598 --> 00:39:10,933
And smile.

477
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,728
Act like we're friends.

478
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:17,107
Now pick up the box and go.

479
00:39:33,961 --> 00:39:35,797
Whatever anybody wants.

480
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:39,760
But I won't sell drugs. I don't do that.

481
00:39:41,137 --> 00:39:42,597
What you want?

482
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,142
I'm getting it.

483
00:39:45,476 --> 00:39:47,061
So you easy then.

484
00:39:47,311 --> 00:39:48,438
Come on.

485
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:52,359
There's got to be something
on the outside you want.

486
00:39:54,153 --> 00:39:55,989
Can you get me a Walkman?

487
00:39:56,823 --> 00:39:59,160
Maybe some music? Some blues?

488
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:00,787
Blues?

489
00:40:03,457 --> 00:40:07,754
All right, I thought you were new school,
and here you are old school, just like me.

490
00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:11,717
Write that shit down. I'll give it to Nelson.

491
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:15,096
Nelson, that fucker. Act like he all hard.

492
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:17,891
That fucker is hard. Do you hear me?

493
00:40:17,975 --> 00:40:19,435
You try to disrespect him...

494
00:40:19,518 --> 00:40:22,439
...he'll come down extra hard
on you so nobody suspects.

495
00:40:22,522 --> 00:40:24,650
Now, you be clear on that shit.

496
00:40:24,858 --> 00:40:27,153
He's still the one with the keys.

497
00:40:28,154 --> 00:40:29,322
You hear me?

498
00:40:29,406 --> 00:40:30,866
Yeah, okay.

499
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:32,159
You best.

500
00:40:37,416 --> 00:40:39,210
Will you blow on it?

501
00:40:39,543 --> 00:40:41,004
Blow on it yourself.

502
00:40:50,891 --> 00:40:52,101
Mom?

503
00:40:58,692 --> 00:41:01,195
Can't you get me transferred over here?

504
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:03,490
Can't we cell together?

505
00:41:04,992 --> 00:41:07,078
All in good time, baby girl.

506
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,539
I got plans.

507
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,834
Let's see.

508
00:41:14,504 --> 00:41:16,548
We'll shade that in later.

509
00:41:17,716 --> 00:41:19,593
After that heals.

510
00:41:20,762 --> 00:41:25,184
You go on over to Kit's and help her
move some shit out to the yard.

511
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:04,817
Crank?

512
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:07,153
No, junk.

513
00:42:07,278 --> 00:42:09,531
Shit, Brownie know you doin' this?

514
00:42:19,961 --> 00:42:22,631
She just told me
she don't be dealing drugs.

515
00:42:22,714 --> 00:42:24,466
She won't sell them...

516
00:42:24,883 --> 00:42:27,720
...but she won't
let that money get by either.

517
00:42:28,096 --> 00:42:30,641
So I get my hands dirty, whatever.

518
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,563
Except there's too much business lately,
so I guess you're up.

519
00:42:37,107 --> 00:42:39,902
I get Unit A and the badges.
That's most of them.

520
00:42:40,528 --> 00:42:42,489
You and Sugar get the rest.

521
00:42:42,572 --> 00:42:43,782
All right.

522
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:47,537
You know,
I'll have to show everybody you're cool.

523
00:42:53,002 --> 00:42:55,171
How you hook up with Brownie?

524
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,508
I came in here the same as you...

525
00:42:57,591 --> 00:43:00,178
...but I didn't have no gang girls.

526
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:03,765
It was me against them.
Them is everybody.

527
00:43:05,726 --> 00:43:09,606
Brownie offered me a hand,
and I took it for life.

528
00:43:17,366 --> 00:43:21,079
You know Brownie was in the Hole
for a year after she first rolled in?

529
00:43:21,162 --> 00:43:22,163
A year?

530
00:43:22,706 --> 00:43:23,832
Word.

531
00:43:26,669 --> 00:43:28,713
I think it messed with her head.

532
00:43:29,798 --> 00:43:31,258
What did she do?

533
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:33,010
187.

534
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,805
Took out a celly from what I heard.

535
00:43:35,972 --> 00:43:37,224
That's cool.

536
00:43:42,022 --> 00:43:44,483
I love her like a mother, for real.

537
00:43:46,861 --> 00:43:48,905
I'd do anything for her.

538
00:43:53,786 --> 00:43:56,122
She inking me a tattoo...

539
00:43:56,957 --> 00:43:58,542
...just like hers.

540
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,048
Yeah.

541
00:44:04,466 --> 00:44:06,093
That's cool.

542
00:44:10,098 --> 00:44:11,433
Hey, Kit.

543
00:44:14,312 --> 00:44:16,106
That's my sister, Treasure.

544
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:33,169
Shit. Hell, yeah.

545
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:46,010
What up, G?

546
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,514
Geeking it with the library crowd.

547
00:45:52,768 --> 00:45:53,728
What?

548
00:45:55,981 --> 00:45:57,733
What you think?

549
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:01,446
What, you dealing for Brownie now?

550
00:46:01,821 --> 00:46:04,616
I should never have told you
she was in here. Shit.

551
00:46:04,742 --> 00:46:05,910
What the fuck?

552
00:46:05,993 --> 00:46:09,164
Who's the one who started me
taggin' and sellin' rock?

553
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:11,458
What's that say on your fist?

554
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:14,045
You should be dealin' with me.

555
00:46:14,295 --> 00:46:15,463
Fine.

556
00:46:15,714 --> 00:46:19,301
Treasure, I changed.
And you haven't changed.

557
00:46:20,261 --> 00:46:22,305
So let's just let it go.

558
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:23,640
Peace.

559
00:46:24,183 --> 00:46:26,602
I don't want to let it go, Shadow.

560
00:46:29,314 --> 00:46:31,901
You my dog from back in the day.

561
00:46:33,194 --> 00:46:34,821
What you studying?

562
00:46:35,572 --> 00:46:37,825
I said, what you studying, bitch?

563
00:46:43,624 --> 00:46:46,878
I was thinking about making a camera.

564
00:46:46,961 --> 00:46:50,799
-I want to take pictures inside.
-You gonna make your own camera?

565
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,597
You're a strange motherfucker.
What you need?

566
00:46:57,391 --> 00:47:00,269
I said, what do you need?
I'm going to hook you up.

567
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,731
I can make the box myself.

568
00:47:02,814 --> 00:47:06,485
But I need this Polaroid photo paper...

569
00:47:06,569 --> 00:47:10,532
...and this here rubber thing
and all this shit on this list.

570
00:47:11,116 --> 00:47:13,160
Yo, just write it down.

571
00:47:13,411 --> 00:47:15,705
I don't think you can get this in.

572
00:47:15,872 --> 00:47:17,666
Write it down, all right?

573
00:47:19,418 --> 00:47:20,628
All right.

574
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,263
Treasure?

575
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:29,431
Yeah?

576
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:33,311
Be careful.

577
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,146
I don't trust her.

578
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:37,608
Who, Brownie?

579
00:47:41,237 --> 00:47:42,906
She's my moms.

580
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,077
I've been wanting her all my life.

581
00:47:46,452 --> 00:47:48,288
Just be happy for me.

582
00:47:57,883 --> 00:48:00,344
-Who the fuck are you?
-Who are you?

583
00:48:00,428 --> 00:48:02,848
-I asked you first.
-Min So.

584
00:48:05,309 --> 00:48:07,812
Yo, Patrice, what happened to Mama Cass?

585
00:48:09,689 --> 00:48:11,567
Fuckin' freakazoid.

586
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:14,904
They say she was paroled.
Her daughter got her out.

587
00:48:15,029 --> 00:48:17,574
You're the one they told me about.
Treasure.

588
00:48:26,419 --> 00:48:30,424
Yeah, whatever.
We speak English up in this chumpy.

589
00:48:31,967 --> 00:48:33,427
Is this your violet?

590
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:35,013
No.

591
00:48:36,515 --> 00:48:40,812
Violets can grow in a place like this.
Not so much water and every...

592
00:48:42,564 --> 00:48:43,982
So it is yours.

593
00:48:45,025 --> 00:48:48,989
I told you it wasn't mine,
but I was taking care of it, though.

594
00:48:59,377 --> 00:49:02,297
What the fuck you got back there,
pork fried rice?

595
00:49:03,215 --> 00:49:05,801
No, chicken. Can you believe it?

596
00:49:05,926 --> 00:49:10,390
Because I have a special diet, they let me
cook in the kitchen and bring food back.

597
00:49:10,808 --> 00:49:13,603
Now I'm going to make fried rice to sell.

598
00:49:14,854 --> 00:49:16,022
To sell?

599
00:49:18,275 --> 00:49:21,237
You ain't selling nothing
up in this motherfucker.

600
00:49:23,031 --> 00:49:26,327
You need a hook up for that shit.

601
00:49:27,745 --> 00:49:30,374
There ain't no takeout window up in here.

602
00:49:30,457 --> 00:49:33,461
I just need to find a way to protect myself.

603
00:49:34,754 --> 00:49:36,798
And how you plan on doin' that?

604
00:49:45,935 --> 00:49:47,979
All right, miss fancy lady.

605
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,455
Thanks.

606
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,220
Smell that.

607
00:50:18,475 --> 00:50:20,812
Nothing like the smell of freshness.

608
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:23,273
Fresh from California.

609
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:27,612
Yo, Granny used to grow
kale and tomatoes.

610
00:50:27,904 --> 00:50:31,408
Remember that little garden
she had on the balcony?

611
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:35,747
I was never around, girl.

612
00:50:36,623 --> 00:50:39,460
I was always on the street and in trouble.

613
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,339
Those are your memories.

614
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,717
Mine aren't the same at all.

615
00:50:46,803 --> 00:50:48,638
She was always telling me:

616
00:50:49,389 --> 00:50:50,933
"You're no good.

617
00:50:51,058 --> 00:50:54,312
"You're going to end up in jail,
just like your father."

618
00:50:56,064 --> 00:50:58,651
I made sure her wishes came true.

619
00:51:01,821 --> 00:51:04,616
That's exactly what she told me about you.

620
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:07,495
Except she said you was dead.

621
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:09,039
You believe that?

622
00:51:09,122 --> 00:51:11,250
Probably trying to protect you.

623
00:51:11,542 --> 00:51:13,252
Keep bad things from you.

624
00:51:13,795 --> 00:51:15,797
Keep bad things from me.

625
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,884
All that nonsense...

626
00:51:19,594 --> 00:51:22,973
...that was in the past,
you got to let that go, baby girl.

627
00:51:24,558 --> 00:51:26,269
You're here now...

628
00:51:26,727 --> 00:51:28,396
...and we together.

629
00:51:28,688 --> 00:51:30,899
And we gotta make it here...

630
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:34,821
...by any means necessary.

631
00:51:40,286 --> 00:51:42,455
I used to dream you would...

632
00:51:42,956 --> 00:51:45,710
...escape and take me away with you.

633
00:51:48,588 --> 00:51:50,424
I didn't understand...

634
00:51:50,924 --> 00:51:54,470
...why you wouldn't write,
why you wouldn't ask about me.

635
00:51:56,974 --> 00:51:58,350
Now I know.

636
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:00,645
Fucking bitch, Granny.

637
00:52:04,233 --> 00:52:06,193
To find you now...

638
00:52:08,863 --> 00:52:10,866
...that's like a miracle.

639
00:52:11,283 --> 00:52:12,576
Treasure.

640
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:15,246
My blood.

641
00:52:20,628 --> 00:52:22,047
Yeah.

642
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:28,054

Here she go now.

668
00:53:54,913 --> 00:53:58,083
What? I know Sugar got my money.

669
00:53:58,167 --> 00:54:00,545
Shit, fire, fuck, man, it's worse.

670
00:54:00,628 --> 00:54:04,591
Ain't nothing worse for you than
if that little hooker ain't got my money.

671
00:54:05,092 --> 00:54:08,889
-Brownie, the package is gone.
-What the fuck you mean, it's gone?

672
00:54:10,432 --> 00:54:12,768
They stole it, all right?
The bitches stole it.

673
00:54:12,852 --> 00:54:15,730
-Who?
-Rosita and them, the Spanish girls.

674
00:54:15,856 --> 00:54:17,900
Are you fucking kiddin' me?

-Are you trying to steal from me, Kit?
-No, I swear to God...

After all I've done for you?

You stupid bitch!

678
00:54:26,327 --> 00:54:28,037
You are such an idiot!

679
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,041
I hate it when you call me that!

680
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:35,463
You better get used to it
until you get this shit worked the fuck out.

681
00:54:37,591 --> 00:54:39,594
I'll see you back at the unit.

682
00:54:40,762 --> 00:54:44,767
-Aren't we going to settle with Nelson?
-What you got to settle with Nelson?

683
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:46,477
You ain't got nothing.

684
00:54:47,103 --> 00:54:49,856
Now, Treasure, she got something.

685
00:54:50,274 --> 00:54:52,234
She's gonna stand with me.

686
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:03,040
I don't like this one,
little fucking smart.ass.

687
00:55:03,165 --> 00:55:06,127
She's here to learn the ropes.
This is my kid, Nelson.

688
00:55:06,168 --> 00:55:07,503
Jesus fucking Christ.

689
00:55:07,587 --> 00:55:11,508
You make me sick with your little
make.believe family bullshit.

690
00:55:12,134 --> 00:55:13,761
We real blood.

691
00:55:14,304 --> 00:55:16,974
-You think you don't make us sick?
-Cool it.

692
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:22,188
I know your type, I've seen you before.
You ain't special, little girl.

693
00:55:22,272 --> 00:55:24,650
You were damaged before you were born.

694
00:55:24,858 --> 00:55:26,778
Stop it, both of you.

695
00:55:32,618 --> 00:55:35,163
You gotta learn how to control your kids.

696
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:41,337
It's like a fucking documentary
for the Discovery Channel.

697
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,964
Ooga.booga niggers.

698
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,800
Fucking look at them.

699
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:47,595
They're two generations away
from swinging in the trees...

700
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:49,264
...bones in the nose.

701
00:55:50,724 --> 00:55:53,770
You can think what you want.
I don't want to hear it.

702
00:55:53,853 --> 00:55:55,397
You'd better, celly.

703
00:55:56,815 --> 00:55:58,526
We gotta stick together.

704
00:55:58,651 --> 00:56:00,653
They already outnumber us.

705
00:56:02,155 --> 00:56:04,032
You think they ain't racist?

706
00:56:04,575 --> 00:56:07,620
You think they ain't saying
the same shit about you?

707
00:56:10,374 --> 00:56:12,501
Come on, let me get this picture.

708
00:56:12,627 --> 00:56:15,297
No, bump that.
Come on, y'all, kick me a beat.

709
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,428
Check it.

710
00:56:20,637 --> 00:56:23,348
"See, I'm L.E.I.S.H.A

711
00:56:23,432 --> 00:56:24,975
"When I grab the microphone

712
00:56:25,059 --> 00:56:26,352
"Baby, I don't play

713
00:56:26,394 --> 00:56:28,897
"'Cause I'm the baddest mother in the land

714
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,692
"You turn your back,
I'm gonna take what I can

715
00:56:31,734 --> 00:56:34,070
"Ain't got a plan if you fuck with me

716
00:56:34,153 --> 00:56:37,449
"You'll be erased,
I'm a doer, so I won't get the cake

717
00:56:37,533 --> 00:56:40,578
"In two weeks, I'm a be kicking' it
Sippin' the Guinness stout

718
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,874
"'Cause 2542 is about to be out"

719
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:46,878
That's what I'm talking about.

720
00:56:47,378 --> 00:56:48,630
Word.

721
00:56:48,797 --> 00:56:52,426
Come on, man,
I want to do a whole prison series.

722
00:56:54,471 --> 00:56:56,390
I got to go, I'll check y'all later.

723
00:56:56,431 --> 00:56:57,850
Where you going?

724
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,728
I've got a business to attend to.

725
00:57:01,271 --> 00:57:02,731
What's up?

726
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:06,861
Tripping. Bump back. Come on.

727
00:57:07,362 --> 00:57:09,072
Take a little picture.

728
00:57:21,379 --> 00:57:22,714
Please.

729
00:57:22,923 --> 00:57:25,426
You see I'm trying to get my eat on.

730
00:57:29,347 --> 00:57:30,808
So what you think?

731
00:57:31,433 --> 00:57:32,810
Girl...

732
00:57:34,312 --> 00:57:36,273
The chink can cook.

733
00:57:36,648 --> 00:57:39,819
That's why I let her follow me around.
I told you.

734
00:57:40,445 --> 00:57:43,490
I'll see about
getting her transferred up in here.

735
00:57:44,408 --> 00:57:47,203
-What about me?
-Did you cook this?

736
00:57:52,668 --> 00:57:54,003
Treasure.

737
00:57:57,174 --> 00:57:58,801
Come on over here.

738
00:57:58,968 --> 00:58:00,803
You're over there pouting.

739
00:58:01,596 --> 00:58:02,681
Come on.

740
00:58:02,848 --> 00:58:05,017
You want some of this?

741
00:58:14,487 --> 00:58:16,031
I got it all back.

742
00:58:20,203 --> 00:58:21,913
It's just $50 short.

743
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:29,673
Don't you make another sound.

744
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:34,053
-Moms, ease up.
-Shut up, Treasure.

745
00:58:35,472 --> 00:58:38,768
Now, you go get my fucking $50.
Do you hear me?

746
00:58:40,103 --> 00:58:42,814
I said, "Do you hear me?"

747
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:45,067
Yes, I hear you.

748
00:58:48,071 --> 00:58:51,158
Now, go get my fucking money
before I put you out.

749
00:58:53,453 --> 00:58:55,413
I'm going to take care of this.

750
00:59:21,029 --> 00:59:22,739
Damn, $50.

751
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:25,660
I could get you $50 just like that.

752
00:59:25,785 --> 00:59:28,163
Don't you worry about Kit's problems.

753
00:59:28,622 --> 00:59:30,332
Worry about yourself.

754
00:59:31,584 --> 00:59:35,046
I'll put you out just like that
if you fuck with my game.

755
00:59:38,968 --> 00:59:40,553
Hey, peace y'all.

756
00:59:41,304 --> 00:59:44,767
Don't stay up. It's always crackin', right?

757
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:46,602
-Word.
-I'll miss y'all.

758
00:59:46,853 --> 00:59:49,356
-We love you girl.
-You know I love you all, too.

759
00:59:49,439 --> 00:59:50,858
And you know what else?

760
00:59:50,941 --> 00:59:52,818
Y'all check for me on BET.

761
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:55,530
I'm gonna be hitting with the viddy.hoes.

762
00:59:59,786 --> 01:00:01,162
G, baby, G!

763
01:00:05,418 --> 01:00:07,253
Yo, take one of that after.

764
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:11,550
One gang tat photo per prisoner.
Sorry. Just stay still.

765
01:00:11,759 --> 01:00:14,179
It ain't no gang. That's my family.

766
01:00:16,765 --> 01:00:18,017
Family.

767
01:00:22,773 --> 01:00:24,316
We used to be family.

768
01:00:24,984 --> 01:00:27,445
We still are. You're my sister.

769
01:00:27,570 --> 01:00:30,949
You're the only person
I ever told about Brownie.

770
01:00:31,242 --> 01:00:32,201
Yeah.

771
01:00:32,368 --> 01:00:34,287
I wish you never did.

772
01:00:35,747 --> 01:00:39,585
Do your thing and step,
because I ain't got time for this.

773
01:00:43,465 --> 01:00:44,884
No worries.

774
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:12,752
What?

775
01:01:13,294 --> 01:01:15,297
Am I doing something wrong?

776
01:01:16,173 --> 01:01:18,592
Do you want to do something else?

777
01:01:25,685 --> 01:01:27,562
I'm alone in the store.

778
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:30,190
She come in.

779
01:01:30,941 --> 01:01:34,571
I always thought, "Maybe she steal."
I don't know, but she come in.

780
01:01:34,654 --> 01:01:36,782
Of course she steals, she's black.

781
01:01:37,282 --> 01:01:39,494
Not everybody steal like that.

782
01:01:41,079 --> 01:01:42,622
This girl, I know.

783
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:45,292
Continue.

784
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:48,672
She take a box of food...

785
01:01:48,755 --> 01:01:50,966
...and put it inside her blouse.

786
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,804
I can't take it anymore.

787
01:01:55,013 --> 01:01:57,224
I tell you, I can't take it anymore.

788
01:01:57,349 --> 01:02:01,855
So I grab her arm, I say,
"You pay for that, or you put it back."

789
01:02:03,357 --> 01:02:04,900
She hit me.

790
01:02:05,902 --> 01:02:08,071
She did, she hit me in the head.

791
01:02:08,363 --> 01:02:09,656
Hard.

792
01:02:11,158 --> 01:02:12,660
I don't remember.

793
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:16,540
I guess I got a gun.

794
01:02:20,378 --> 01:02:22,547
-I didn't mean to.
-Sure, you didn't.

795
01:02:22,631 --> 01:02:26,177
You're so full of shit.
You don't know how you got the gun.

796
01:02:27,053 --> 01:02:28,388
Fuck you!

797
01:02:28,597 --> 01:02:30,766
I'll take your fucking ass out!

798
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:44,783
You know, we're women here.
We have a common fucking bond.

799
01:02:44,909 --> 01:02:47,579
And we could use that
and come together...

800
01:02:47,704 --> 01:02:50,374
...rather than to fight like this
over some bullshit.

801
01:02:50,499 --> 01:02:54,212
Because there's lots of other issues
that we could unify.

802
01:02:57,549 --> 01:03:00,178
I ain't mad at nobody about nothing.

803
01:03:00,261 --> 01:03:03,015
Min's my girl, we live together.

804
01:03:04,892 --> 01:03:08,897
Should a bitch steal from me,
I'd shoot her, too, you know?

805
01:03:19,452 --> 01:03:21,162
Why you hawking me?

806
01:03:21,329 --> 01:03:23,206
Ain't nothing up.

807
01:03:25,459 --> 01:03:28,296
Don't be looking at her.
Watch what you're doing.

808
01:03:37,141 --> 01:03:41,229
What in the hell
are you two KKK bitches up to?

809
01:03:41,771 --> 01:03:43,398
Nothing is up.

810
01:03:44,817 --> 01:03:47,529
Damn, you treat me like I'm your yard dog
or something.

811
01:03:47,695 --> 01:03:50,783
-You are my dog.
-No, I'm your daughter.

812
01:03:51,659 --> 01:03:53,453
At least I used to be.

813
01:03:53,494 --> 01:03:55,497
Cut that jealous crap.

814
01:03:55,664 --> 01:03:57,082
Jealous of what?

815
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:00,628
Of you pretending to care
about Treasure here?

816
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,092
Shit, that don't bother me none.

817
01:04:05,426 --> 01:04:06,886
'Cause I know what's up.

818
01:04:07,512 --> 01:04:10,265
I've come to find the truth about Brownie.

819
01:04:11,058 --> 01:04:14,395
The only person Brownie cares about
is Brownie.

820
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:17,358
That's it! I am through with you.

821
01:04:17,441 --> 01:04:19,318
Get this shit! Let's go!

822
01:04:25,743 --> 01:04:27,203
Brownie, wait.

823
01:04:41,179 --> 01:04:42,889
Yo, where the hell's Min?

824
01:04:42,973 --> 01:04:45,643
Transferred back to Psych.
Glad to get rid of the chink.

825
01:04:45,726 --> 01:04:47,979
-Watch your mouth.
-Whatever.

826
01:04:48,313 --> 01:04:52,276
She was chang, chow, chang.in'
all afternoon, driving me crazy.

827
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:55,196
-I said, watch it.
-You watch it.

828
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,867
Is it big bad Treasure
who's gonna fuck me up?

829
01:04:58,033 --> 01:05:01,329
Better yet, get her big bad mommy
to fuck me up 'cause she's a...

830
01:05:01,413 --> 01:05:02,748
'Cause she a what?

831
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:06,419
Go on and tell me what she is.

832
01:05:08,922 --> 01:05:11,675
-Why'd they take her?
-Hell, I don't know.

833
01:05:12,593 --> 01:05:16,431
She got some letter from her son,
talking about going back to Taiwan...

834
01:05:16,557 --> 01:05:18,976
...Korea, wherever those people come from.

835
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:21,062
And she lost it. How about that?

836
01:05:21,855 --> 01:05:22,981
Jesus.

837
01:05:23,273 --> 01:05:26,235
Jesus ain't got nothing to do
with those people.

838
01:05:26,986 --> 01:05:29,322
What you know about Jesus, bitch?

839
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,329
I know enough to know you're
damn enjoyin' this all to hell.

840
01:05:34,663 --> 01:05:37,625
You and all your sacrilegious leslies.

841
01:05:37,708 --> 01:05:39,544
Got the nerve to defile the church.

842
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:42,172
What are you thinking?
What's wrong with you?

843
01:05:42,714 --> 01:05:44,341
You should shut up.

844
01:05:44,967 --> 01:05:46,844
Can't change the word of God.

845
01:05:47,303 --> 01:05:51,183
You can do whatever you want to me,
but you can't touch the word of God.

846
01:05:51,308 --> 01:05:53,269
He sees everything.

847
01:05:54,062 --> 01:05:55,981
Did he see you fucking the CO?

848
01:05:56,315 --> 01:05:59,151
Did he see you fucking a married man?

849
01:06:00,904 --> 01:06:02,823
You see that, God Almighty?

850
01:06:03,115 --> 01:06:05,034
You see what's up in here?

851
01:06:28,271 --> 01:06:30,482
I'm liking it over here.

852
01:06:30,566 --> 01:06:32,109
Ain't no thing.

853
01:06:32,485 --> 01:06:35,864
Just wanted to spend a little time
alone with my girl.

854
01:06:36,907 --> 01:06:38,826
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing.

855
01:06:38,868 --> 01:06:42,414
That's right.
Chicken wings and a side order...

856
01:06:42,497 --> 01:06:44,792
...of macaroni and cheese.

857
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:48,463
Cornbread with lots of butter.

858
01:06:48,797 --> 01:06:52,051
Stop, Treasure.
Damn! You making me hungry.

859
01:06:54,095 --> 01:06:55,555
Let me see that.

860
01:06:57,266 --> 01:06:59,352
That looks good. It's coming along.

861
01:07:00,144 --> 01:07:02,564
But I need to shade it a little in there.

862
01:07:03,190 --> 01:07:05,234
So it looks more like mine.

863
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:06,736
Bad!

864
01:07:06,778 --> 01:07:07,988
See?

865
01:07:09,156 --> 01:07:10,574
It's gonna be good.

866
01:07:13,411 --> 01:07:14,704
King me!

867
01:07:27,595 --> 01:07:29,097
Come on, baby.

868
01:07:29,806 --> 01:07:31,600
We're going to a party.

869
01:07:42,155 --> 01:07:43,156
Do it!

870
01:07:43,657 --> 01:07:44,909
Do it now!

871
01:07:47,954 --> 01:07:50,958
Spanish bitches.
Teach you to steal from me.

872
01:07:51,917 --> 01:07:53,127
Don't fuck with me.

873
01:07:58,384 --> 01:07:59,635
Rosita.

874
01:10:36,206 --> 01:10:38,668
I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

875
01:10:38,793 --> 01:10:40,920
Moms and I got business to attend to.

876
01:10:41,046 --> 01:10:42,214
Whatever.

877
01:10:42,422 --> 01:10:44,091
But I warned you.

878
01:10:47,512 --> 01:10:51,141
Trying to fuck me up,
I don't understand all this bullshit.

879
01:10:54,646 --> 01:10:56,565
It could've been you.

880
01:10:57,107 --> 01:10:58,901
What you talking about?

881
01:10:59,110 --> 01:11:00,987
What am I talking about?

882
01:11:01,321 --> 01:11:03,031
Sabrina wrote me up.

883
01:11:03,490 --> 01:11:05,493
You told her you was with me.

884
01:11:06,285 --> 01:11:08,079
I thought I could trust you.

885
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:09,915
You can. What happened?

886
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,333
What happened?

887
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:12,835
You tell me.

888
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:16,507
It was you and Kit, wasn't it?

889
01:11:16,548 --> 01:11:19,427
You two bitches are trying to fuck me up,
aren't you?

890
01:11:19,635 --> 01:11:21,638
-Aren't you?
-Come on, we blood!

891
01:11:21,972 --> 01:11:24,850
You and me ain't shit. I'll show you blood!

892
01:11:25,059 --> 01:11:27,645
I'll show you your blood all over this cell!

893
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:31,984
What?

894
01:11:32,068 --> 01:11:34,237
You gonna cry like a little bitch now?

895
01:11:34,529 --> 01:11:38,075
You should've listened to Scar.
Scar listens to me.

896
01:11:39,702 --> 01:11:41,079
Fucking Kit!

897
01:11:45,293 --> 01:11:47,921
The biggest pain
I've ever had to deal with...

898
01:11:48,004 --> 01:11:50,674
...is the feelings to do with my kids.

899
01:11:50,883 --> 01:11:52,468
I have three sons.

900
01:11:53,136 --> 01:11:57,391
My two oldest boys were taken from me
when I was in the second term.

901
01:11:58,517 --> 01:12:02,940
My youngest boy, I was pregnant with
when I was in the Federal pen.

902
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:07,988
They didn't want a mom
that was an ex.convict.

903
01:12:08,071 --> 01:12:11,534
They don't want a mom
that's a prostitute or a burglar.

904
01:12:12,952 --> 01:12:15,247
Treasure, do you want to say anything?

905
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:19,627
I don't feel like it.

906
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:21,212
Why not?

907
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,340
I just don't.

908
01:12:28,138 --> 01:12:29,806
My kids hate me.

909
01:12:31,934 --> 01:12:33,144
Why?

910
01:12:35,480 --> 01:12:37,650
I don't know. I've made mistakes.

911
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:39,986
We all make mistakes.

912
01:12:42,906 --> 01:12:45,326
I'll pay for it the rest of my life.

913
01:12:46,828 --> 01:12:48,246
Everybody say:

914
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:50,457
"You got so much anger."

915
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:58,801
When my kids needed me I wasn't there.

916
01:13:00,512 --> 01:13:01,888
The drugs...

917
01:13:02,389 --> 01:13:04,225
It was pretty much the drugs.

918
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:06,936
The last time my daughter told me:

919
01:13:07,061 --> 01:13:08,647
"I hate you."

920
01:13:11,984 --> 01:13:14,821
People say, "Why are you so angry?"

921
01:13:15,822 --> 01:13:18,159
I've always been able to reverse...

922
01:13:18,451 --> 01:13:20,411
...everything that I did.

923
01:13:20,912 --> 01:13:23,415
I can't reverse the hatred in her face.

924
01:13:24,458 --> 01:13:27,003
No matter what I do, no matter what I say.

925
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:29,256
I can't get through to her.

926
01:13:39,727 --> 01:13:41,062
It's like that?

927
01:13:41,813 --> 01:13:43,273
Yeah, it's like that.

928
01:13:55,914 --> 01:13:57,917
Wanna get you in with me.

929
01:13:58,376 --> 01:14:00,879
Been trying to figure out
how to go about that.

930
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:03,841
Telling me I don't mean nothing
to you was a good start.

931
01:14:04,049 --> 01:14:06,803
I just lost my manner.
You know that, baby.

932
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:07,971
"Baby."

933
01:14:08,054 --> 01:14:12,101
You picked the wrong person
to lose your manner with.

934
01:14:13,895 --> 01:14:16,106
You always hurt the one you love.

935
01:14:17,316 --> 01:14:19,610
Listen, I thought you turned on me.

936
01:14:20,028 --> 01:14:21,446
I found out...

937
01:14:22,072 --> 01:14:23,532
...it was Kit.

938
01:14:24,199 --> 01:14:27,203
She told the warden
about our little pillow fight.

939
01:14:27,245 --> 01:14:30,958
I just spent my first night in the Hole
in a long, long time.

940
01:14:33,127 --> 01:14:35,213
Kit's gotta hear about this.

941
01:14:37,174 --> 01:14:39,218
I need you to take her down.

942
01:14:40,011 --> 01:14:41,680
It's gotta be done.

943
01:14:41,805 --> 01:14:45,268
Otherwise we gonna lose
the control we got right now.

944
01:14:45,393 --> 01:14:47,270
And you gotta do it.

945
01:14:49,022 --> 01:14:50,774
You do this and...

946
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:53,862
And what?

947
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:05,084
When?

948
01:15:08,463 --> 01:15:10,299
When the time is right.

949
01:15:40,962 --> 01:15:42,714
Come on, you pussies!

950
01:15:42,881 --> 01:15:45,593
What I got to do to get a game going?

951
01:15:46,177 --> 01:15:47,762
Who's gonna play?

952
01:15:52,101 --> 01:15:53,895
Looking for a game?

953
01:15:54,813 --> 01:15:56,774
How about skins versus shit?

954
01:15:56,982 --> 01:15:58,901
What you talking about, cracker?

955
01:15:59,277 --> 01:16:00,987
This is skin...

956
01:16:01,321 --> 01:16:02,990
...and that's shit.

957
01:16:04,241 --> 01:16:05,910
You gonna regret that.

958
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,662
You think so?

959
01:16:08,163 --> 01:16:09,456
I doubt it.

960
01:16:09,706 --> 01:16:13,002
I think things around here
have been upside down for too long.

961
01:16:13,252 --> 01:16:14,921
Too uncivilized.

962
01:16:15,172 --> 01:16:16,465
Too tribal.

963
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:19,677
COs think so, too.

964
01:16:20,386 --> 01:16:22,264
-Yo, Moms.
-Shut up.

965
01:16:25,726 --> 01:16:27,645
This the way you play me, Kit?

966
01:16:27,812 --> 01:16:30,315
You taught me everything I know, Moms.

967
01:16:31,776 --> 01:16:32,902
Okay.

968
01:16:35,614 --> 01:16:37,074
Let's do this.

969
01:16:39,619 --> 01:16:41,329
Me and Kit. One on one.

970
01:16:44,542 --> 01:16:46,252
Do what you gotta do, Boo.

971
01:16:47,045 --> 01:16:48,672
Do what you gotta do.

972
01:16:49,882 --> 01:16:51,133
Come on.

973
01:16:52,134 --> 01:16:54,429
Okay, we gonna work this shit out.

974
01:16:55,055 --> 01:16:58,476
They don't fuckin' want you.
You ain't a part of their family.

975
01:16:59,060 --> 01:17:01,021
Watch for my signal.

976
01:17:01,605 --> 01:17:03,482
After you kick her ass.

977
01:17:10,741 --> 01:17:12,159
So get to it.

978
01:17:17,207 --> 01:17:19,919
I don't even think we need the ball for this.

979
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,710
What the hell are you doing?

980
01:17:52,794 --> 01:17:54,588
I kicked her ass good.

981
01:17:54,713 --> 01:17:57,007
I didn't give you the blade
to kick her ass good.

982
01:17:57,132 --> 01:17:59,928
I can't believe you punkin' out.
I can't believe this shit!

983
01:18:00,011 --> 01:18:02,514
-It's not like that.
-I'll tell you what it's like.

984
01:18:02,639 --> 01:18:04,683
You need to get your ass over there...

985
01:18:04,767 --> 01:18:06,686
...and finish this shit off.

986
01:18:53,578 --> 01:18:55,998
Hello, Treasure. Do you know who I am?

987
01:18:56,123 --> 01:18:57,792
-You're the warden.
-Yes.

988
01:18:57,875 --> 01:19:01,129
-Arnold.
-I need to know what happened.

989
01:19:01,338 --> 01:19:04,341
-What about Brownie?
-She's in very serious condition.

990
01:19:04,467 --> 01:19:06,010
Does she need blood?

991
01:19:06,177 --> 01:19:08,430
Yeah, but that's not your concern.

992
01:19:08,722 --> 01:19:10,432
She's my mother.

993
01:19:13,728 --> 01:19:16,690
-Why didn't I know this?
-I don't know.

994
01:19:17,066 --> 01:19:20,320
-I thought y'all were a play family.
-They are. Not me.

995
01:19:20,403 --> 01:19:22,531
She's my mother.
You gotta let me help her.

996
01:19:22,614 --> 01:19:26,077
-Why did you assault her like that?
-Me? It was Kit.

997
01:19:27,829 --> 01:19:30,624
Take me to her before she dies,
goddamn it!

998
01:19:36,298 --> 01:19:38,008
Hey, John, I need the paperwork.

999
01:19:44,225 --> 01:19:45,393
Leisha.

1000
01:19:48,188 --> 01:19:49,606
What happened?

1001
01:19:50,441 --> 01:19:52,318
Hell, I don't know.

1002
01:19:52,735 --> 01:19:55,030
I was at my cousin's party.

1003
01:19:55,864 --> 01:19:58,159
We was partying, too.

1004
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:03,081
Four days later, the police are shaking me:

1005
01:20:03,749 --> 01:20:06,419
"Tell me. Is this your pipe?"

1006
01:20:07,629 --> 01:20:09,506
I'm like, "What pipe?"

1007
01:20:10,466 --> 01:20:12,426
"That pipe!"

1008
01:20:17,391 --> 01:20:19,018
2879.

1009
01:20:22,648 --> 01:20:23,774
That's me.

1010
01:20:24,567 --> 01:20:26,069
You can go.

1011
01:20:26,194 --> 01:20:28,530
What's going on?
I'm gonna give my blood.

1012
01:20:28,613 --> 01:20:32,660
We appreciate the offer, but you're type A.
Phyllis Stubbs is type B.

1013
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:34,996
You got the wrong fucking chart.

1014
01:20:35,163 --> 01:20:37,792
Brownie Lee is my mother. Margaret Lee.

1015
01:20:41,588 --> 01:20:42,798
Sorry.

1016
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,843
-Listen to me, bitch!
-Stop it!

1017
01:20:46,177 --> 01:20:47,679
Show me the chart.

1018
01:20:49,181 --> 01:20:50,641
Just do it.

1019
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:53,978
You calm down.
We'll straighten everything out.

1020
01:20:58,275 --> 01:21:00,195
I don't see nothing about no child.

1021
01:21:00,278 --> 01:21:03,323
They took me away from my mother.

1022
01:21:04,241 --> 01:21:05,910
"Phyllis Stubbs-42.

1023
01:21:05,993 --> 01:21:08,538
"1974. Five years for fraud.

1024
01:21:08,622 --> 01:21:11,667
"1978. 25-life. Second degree murder.

1025
01:21:12,043 --> 01:21:13,711
"1980.

1026
01:21:18,259 --> 01:21:22,180
"Life without parole
for the fatal stabbing of Margaret Lee."

1027
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:32,235
-Treasure, calm down.
-No!

1028
01:21:32,986 --> 01:21:34,446
Guys, help me.

1029
01:21:34,738 --> 01:21:36,114
Calm down.

1030
01:21:38,284 --> 01:21:39,535
Calm down.

1031
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:41,121
Guys, handcuff her.

1032
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:42,789
Handcuff her.

1033
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:18,668
Treasure.

1034
01:22:20,003 --> 01:22:23,966
This woman you thought was your mother,
do you realize who she is?

1035
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:28,722
She murdered your mother.

1036
01:22:32,351 --> 01:22:36,023
I'd like to help you, because I'm sorry
for all you've been through.

1037
01:22:36,231 --> 01:22:39,944
But first, we're gonna have to talk
about you and the others.

1038
01:22:41,947 --> 01:22:44,825
We've been watching Officer Nelson
and his...

1039
01:22:44,951 --> 01:22:47,913
...relations with inmates
for some time now.

1040
01:22:49,915 --> 01:22:52,126
If you'll help us out...

1041
01:22:54,296 --> 01:22:57,341
...we'll transfer you
to a minimum security prison.

1042
01:23:05,393 --> 01:23:10,316
"Prisoners who wish to no longer
be associated with prison gang activity...

1043
01:23:10,983 --> 01:23:13,236
"...must give names
and provide information...

1044
01:23:13,278 --> 01:23:15,739
"...regarding any criminal activities.

1045
01:23:15,948 --> 01:23:18,993
"Having become an informant...

1046
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:22,706
"...the prisoner must rely
on the Department of Corrections...

1047
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:24,667
"...to protect them."

1048
01:24:39,677 --> 01:24:41,471
Keep it up, Treasure.

1049
01:24:44,058 --> 01:24:45,560
Yo, Shadow.

1050
01:24:52,443 --> 01:24:54,529
Stand perfectly still, right?

1051
01:25:14,721 --> 01:25:16,223
Let's go, Treasure.

1052
01:26:38,534 --> 01:26:39,661
Yo, new fish, you got a smoke?

1053
01:26:39,661 --> 01:26:40,912
Yo, new fish, you got a smoke?

1054
01:26:52,135 --> 01:26:53,720
What's your name, girl?

1055
01:26:56,515 --> 01:26:57,725
Brownie.
