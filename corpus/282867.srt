1
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,165
Thief! Thief...!

2
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,018
Stop! Don't run!

3
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,686
Get up and go

4
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,897
Master, it's lucky that
we've only lost money

5
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,534
Where's my twin son?

6
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,607
You've asked them
to find the sheriff!

7
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:11,640
They have come back!

8
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,752
Father, the sheriff is coming!

9
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:17,884
Who's the sheriff now?

10
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,584
Butcher Wing!

11
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:50,152
How dare you shit in the street!

12
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,256
That's is not mine

13
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,189
Not you?

14
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:57,488
Then why nobody laugh but you?

15
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:00,931
Do you know who am l?

16
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,032
I would like to know

17
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:07,069
I'm Butcher Wing!

18
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,899
Ah-sah! Ah-tsai!

19
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:08,733
Yes!

20
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,069
What's the penalty of
shiting on the street?

21
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:13,706
$5!

22
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,677
Search him to see how much he got!

23
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,144
Sir, he has $10!

24
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,187
Confiscate!

25
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:29,718
The penalty is only $5

26
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,830
How...about another $5?

27
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,295
Come over here, old man...

28
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,694
Well?

29
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:38,394
Tomorrow, you can come
and shit one more time

30
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,496
Ridiculous

31
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:47,877
"Flower Kid" has retired
for a long time!

32
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:51,016
It's your hard luck that

33
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,412
he come and visit you

34
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,145
Sure I can find him but not easy!

35
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,346
There's only one person

36
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,117
who can catch him

37
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:01,324
Am I alright?

38
00:06:01,494 --> 00:06:02,859
Not you!

39
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,457
Shut up! What the hell you know?

40
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:09,394
She's been around too

41
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:13,027
Good... go on!

42
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,931
He collected bad debts

43
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,406
and found missing guy

44
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,976
But his profession is a Crook!

45
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:19,907
Who's he?

46
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,838
Skinny Gee!

47
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,218
He has broken

48
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,148
the world record one time

49
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:03,752
He chased a fat guy

50
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,050
for 7 whole days and nights

51
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,495
Turned him into a thin fellow
and hanged himself

52
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,025
But it's very difficult

53
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,760
to hire him

54
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:21,471
Difficult? Who am l?

55
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:22,630
Butcher Wing!

56
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,538
With me, everything will be alright

57
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,747
It's him!

58
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:34,453
What would you like to drink?

59
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,079
Plain water

60
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,344
What's the penalty of
picking up property on ground

61
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,638
At least 4 years

62
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,109
What if you've no evidence?

63
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:04,306
Release!

64
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:09,887
It's gone!

65
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:11,881
You swallowed it?

66
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,115
Swallow again!

67
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:14,884
I don't want it!

68
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:15,755
It belongs to whom?

69
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:16,826
Yours!

70
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:26,070
How dare you stole my jade

71
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,301
It's my mother's jade,

72
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,238
she'll kill you

73
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,577
Search him!

74
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,375
That's not necessary,
the jade is over there

75
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,182
Sheriff, it's really your jade

76
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:49,087
You disguising guy!

77
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:54,029
Not at all

78
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,691
Watch out for the ditches!

79
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,398
Indecent assault!

80
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,634
What do you want?
How about her measurements?

81
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,038
I have seen only her chest!

82
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,374
How can I judge without
seeing the other part?

83
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,743
Brother

84
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,044
He starts at my private parts!

85
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,648
How can you say this?

86
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,795
I do this because

87
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:04,368
I wish you can do me a favour

88
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,469
That's easy, who's he, tell me!

89
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:16,774
"Flower Kid", you'll have a reward

90
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:18,711
How much?

91
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:20,112
$500

92
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,347
Really? Really

93
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,214
Is it true? Yes

94
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,184
Good!

95
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,922
But I need your sister's help

96
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:37,158
Are you sure we can
find "Flower Kid"?

97
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:40,097
Yes, he's like a hero
and protects women

98
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:42,968
All heroes lkie to do the same go!

99
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,078
Where are we going?

100
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,271
To the casino or the brothel!

101
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:50,107
Then we...

102
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,580
Can you just keep your mouth shut?

103
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,917
Go...!

104
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,226
Go...!

105
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:17,267
This is my wife,
how much does she worth?

106
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:19,773
You don't have to torture

107
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,311
your wife like this!

108
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,273
How about me? Tell me!

109
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:26,645
She's my wife, not yours

110
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:27,843
You must have some

111
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,748
dirty idea about her!

112
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,286
If you do,

113
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,424
I hate you

114
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:34,855
I have just spoken one word!

115
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,187
Now, you're speaking the second!

116
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,889
Shut up! Damned you

117
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,292
If one is not enough, then I'll use two

118
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:44,868
If two is not enough, I'll use four

119
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,131
How can you talk again?

120
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,031
You asked for it

121
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,040
I'm the big shot of

122
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:56,348
the amusement circle!

123
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,580
So you run the brothel,

124
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,479
fantastic!

125
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:00,880
How much does she worth?

126
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:01,881
$50

127
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,885
Crazy, she doesn't worth this price!

128
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,319
$2! Look at her!

129
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:25,042
You'll sure lose!

130
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,178
I'm willing to lose!

131
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:32,045
3 ones!

132
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,791
Come on!

133
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,728
You said that

134
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,695
"Flower Kid" will appear

135
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,357
Yes, right the way!

136
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:54,768
Open, 3 ones!

137
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,206
Is "Flower Kid" handsome?

138
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,279
Of course! He's a big star

139
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,278
He has not come yet?

140
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,438
He'll come very soon!

141
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:07,450
Stake!

142
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:13,286
4, 5, 6! 15 is large!

143
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,688
Damn...!

144
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,733
What'll he do to me when he comes?

145
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,768
He'll kill you!

146
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,004
Take off your hands!

147
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,334
You take off yours first!

148
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:38,246
Let's give up together!

149
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:56,735
Go!

150
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,448
Who are you?

151
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,589
Are you "Flower Kid"?

152
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,322
"Flower Kid"

153
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,595
You're no "Flower Kid" to me

154
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:04,834
Damned, Fatty has hurt me

155
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,434
Let me do it in return

156
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:13,912
One punch

157
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,138
can hurt me so much

158
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,676
There's only one man

159
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,647
who has such power

160
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:22,844
It's "Flower Kid",

161
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,781
please applause!

162
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,826
"Flower Kid" is a hero,

163
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,489
rob the rich give to poor

164
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:40,566
It's mine

165
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:41,933
I know

166
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,502
He's read to donate

167
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:47,168
this to the poor

168
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,913
Please applause!

169
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:15,703
This is one thing

170
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,307
we all should learn

171
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:21,543
Now, I'll give my
money to all of you

172
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,813
You're very generous!

173
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,422
Because the money isn't mine!

174
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,420
Why don't you go to rob?

175
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:36,493
I'll rob some from the
unrighteous fellow tonight

176
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:37,690
This is doing righteousness!

177
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,194
Where?

178
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:41,922
Up there!

179
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,329
Inside a room

180
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:45,829
Gangs are going to have

181
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,836
a jewellery deal tonight

182
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,338
It's all dirty money

183
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:53,472
Let's co-operate

184
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:57,748
You'll go and rob and I'll watch you

185
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:58,814
And then?

186
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,645
We'll share the money

187
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,284
Count the money,

188
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,786
you'll watch me! Fair?

189
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,458
Fair enough! Will they come?

190
00:17:09,628 --> 00:17:11,858
Yes, they will

191
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,297
Well, have you found him!

192
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:22,599
Yes!

193
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:24,933
Big secret,

194
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,702
I'll tell you only

195
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,648
Get out you two!

196
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:31,373
What did you say?

197
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,882
Get out!

198
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,647
Get out!

199
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,355
Speak!

200
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:42,290
I've found "Flower Kid"

201
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,354
You must go and catch him

202
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:46,623
Where?

203
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,626
I made him to appear on a deal

204
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:49,799
What deal?

205
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,562
Two gangs are going to
have a underground deal

206
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,175
Jewelry deal, he'll come to rob

207
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:59,674
Then you can catch him

208
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,673
Who are the parties of tonight?

209
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:07,850
One is you and the other
is the mean millionaire

210
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:17,989
But these are real money,
don't you afraid?

211
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,188
Why should l?

212
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,731
Look what I've got here

213
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,697
People in the corridor,

214
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:26,869
upstairs, rooms

215
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,439
And everywhere

216
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:33,475
There's a person wherever
there should be one

217
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,913
He's coming!

218
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:40,676
Where's he?

219
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:41,342
There!

220
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,316
Close the door!

221
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:43,887
Let's start the deal!

222
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:48,250
Stand behind for 3 feet!

223
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,689
What? Play ping pong?

224
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,223
I don't trust you!

225
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,659
You don't even trust me!

226
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,288
Let's me told you

227
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,698
Even my hands don't trust each other

228
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:01,135
Then... stand 3 feet behind!
Alright!

229
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,068
You?

230
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:04,140
Me!

231
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,242
Put it down! Hurry!

232
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,045
Then make him come to snatch

233
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,255
Open it

234
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,515
It's so frightening! Forget it

235
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:15,911
Go and catch him!

236
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:17,378
Hurry!

237
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:19,708
The thief is in the
room downstairs!

238
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,185
Hurry...!

239
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,090
No

240
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,523
You damned!

241
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,128
Sir, "Flower Kid" has escaped!

242
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,004
How dare you beat him in front of me?

243
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,340
Yes!

244
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,044
I've never expected he'll do this

245
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:53,980
What are you going to do?

246
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:56,177
Let me out and I'll take him back

247
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,687
No, take him back to my office

248
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:08,165
I asked you to catch "Flower Kid"

249
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,164
But you double-crossed me too

250
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,467
He has cheated me too!

251
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:16,735
I can't stop laughing!

252
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:34,156
I can't stand it!

253
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,331
Mother, no, wife, I can't stand it!

254
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,577
You have done everything
except the good!

255
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,511
Just make friends with those bad guys

256
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,847
Get out when I count three!

257
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,146
Or I'll lock you up!

258
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:05,390
Sheriff, don't lost you temper!

259
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,184
The plague has broken out

260
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,385
in this town!

261
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:11,494
What's plague?

262
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:13,927
Don't tell him, let him die faster!

263
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:15,130
You should die too!

264
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,461
You'll die immediately

265
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,968
if you catch it

266
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:23,869
Add you'll infect your family too

267
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:26,569
Can it be cure?

268
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,941
Yes, just one injection!

269
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,814
Can I just take pills?

270
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:34,974
No!

271
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:37,677
Give me a shot!

272
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,914
Alright, turn around!

273
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,253
Can we do without the injection?

274
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:42,325
Yes, if you can stand the pain?
Yes, I can

275
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,358
You still accuse me?
No!

276
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,790
Then you'll be responsible for the outcome
Yes!

277
00:22:44,996 --> 00:22:45,963
Close your eyes

278
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,033
Who are you really?

279
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,100
"Flower Kid"

280
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:56,297
No, he hates woman,

281
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,467
he won't disguise as a woman

282
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,478
Furthermore, he's not so fat

283
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,510
Why?

284
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:04,977
If he is,

285
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,447
he wouldn't be called "Flower Kid"

286
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:07,949
He'll just be a stupid melon!

287
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,780
Also, he's not so young as you!

288
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,651
So you're not "Flower Kid"

289
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,424
Tell me, who you are!

290
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:18,852
Fatso!

291
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,493
Sit...!

292
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,805
I don't care who you are

293
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,099
I like you,

294
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,268
Iet me be the host!

295
00:23:33,445 --> 00:23:35,538
Coming!

296
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:36,510
One bowl of plain noodle

297
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:37,739
One bowl for two

298
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:38,777
Of course,

299
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,212
you want to join us to eat

300
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,985
This is to express my thanks to you

301
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,981
It's alright!

302
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,254
But we are not alright

303
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:53,455
Take the jewel!

304
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:54,758
All gone!

305
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:58,925
Repeat

306
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,039
I've given them to the poor!

307
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:17,750
15 inches collar, standard size

308
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,318
You're in trouble,

309
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:23,188
your enemies are there!

310
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,859
I don't even know them

311
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,394
But they're staring at you!

312
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,033
And they know you, look!

313
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,305
Really?

314
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,504
Calm down, see what they want

315
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:46,580
They start the trouble

316
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,810
What are you waiting for, move!

317
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,188
They use knives!

318
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,487
Then use your hand and head, go!

319
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,564
Go!

320
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,019
You fight very good,

321
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,518
I'll praise you latter

322
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,991
Still remember?

323
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,956
I've kicked you before

324
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:34,198
So hard!

325
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,830
It's here!

326
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:43,902
We'll split it half

327
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:46,009
Let me give it to the poor

328
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:47,073
Sure,

329
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:48,405
but not my share!

330
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,444
Let me keep it

331
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:51,309
till tomorrow

332
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,007
No!

333
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:01,158
You ain't a good person!

334
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:03,720
Why do you take me here?

335
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:04,884
To find "Flower Kid"

336
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,121
Even he needs prostitutes?

337
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:07,657
Every men needs prostitutes

338
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:09,023
I have never been here before

339
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,099
You're exceptional, you're unable!

00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,405
You said you've never been here

343
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:23,807
You take credit card?

344
00:26:24,115 --> 00:26:26,106
No, he's on the house

345
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:30,383
How can you refuse to
pay the prostitute?

346
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,316
No... he has saved my life once

347
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,185
Or I would have died already!

348
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,087
Yes!

349
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:38,456

Where have you been?

383
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,642
Shut up!
I'm going to save somebody!

384
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:54,221
You?

385
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:55,484
I'm alright!

386
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,389
Then... where's the gold?

387
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:58,426
Fatso has taken it

388
00:29:58,596 --> 00:29:59,085
Where's he?

389
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,162
Gone!

390
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,429
I'm deceived the first time

391
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,004
I do good

392
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:16,877
What's happened? Are you blind?

393
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:20,548
I understand!

394
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:21,377
Don't mention it...!

395
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:22,611
Thanks!

396
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,190
I'll push you!

397
00:30:27,792 --> 00:30:28,315
I push!

398
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:29,755
I push!

399
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:30,986
I push too!

400
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,285
I push!

401
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:35,858
Let me show you some tricks!

402
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,702
What are you doing?

403
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:48,870
Epilepsy!

404
00:30:51,749 --> 00:30:52,681
Then you need grass!

405
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,182
Grass can't do!

406
00:30:59,357 --> 00:30:59,948
Then what will do?

407
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:00,783
Gold!

408
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:01,448
It's gone!

409
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:02,490
Gone?

410
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,486
Yes!

411
00:31:04,662 --> 00:31:05,924
I have donated it!

412
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,124
Please teach me to whom

413
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,269
you donate the gold!

414
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:14,632
I've resumed the
freedom of the girl!

415
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:19,443
Thanks, my benefactor!

416
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,143
Not at all!

417
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:24,438
I kill you!

418
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,642
Benefactor, I've found it!

419
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,653
But that guys

420
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:33,882
got something against you

421
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:35,583
What's wrong with me?

422
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,123
He's causing trouble everywhere

423
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:41,322
Everyone is afraid of him

424
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,631
I'll beat him

425
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,795
Don't be emotional!

426
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,103
Where can we find "Flower Kid"

427
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,304
Next village, the good restaurant

428
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,614
Someone is following us

429
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,904
Guilty... why the girls
so mad of me!

430
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:22,539
I'm so

431
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:23,799
handsome!

432
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:25,702
Let me kiss her!

433
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,283
You dare talk about love at the stage

434
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,325
You should wait until
you have some achievement

435
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:46,890
Get rid of her,
we've something serious to do

436
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,230
How?

437
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,761
Use you brain!

438
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,363
You got a brain too

439
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,181
Wait a moment!

440
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:48,416
I hate people

441
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:49,560
stealing chickens

442
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,251
Let's go...!

443
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:58,493
It must be good restaurant!

444
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,397
Boss, who is "Flower Kid"?

445
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,372
He has not arrived yet

446
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,177
Ah-shan!

447
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:07,970
What's it?

448
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:10,307
Get ready, there's going
to have a fight!

449
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,379
What's happened?

450
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,984
Someone ask for "Flower Kid",

451
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:15,983
there'll be a fight

452
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:17,917
No, I'm here

453
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,389
You come for "Flower Kid"

454
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,150
if you admire him

455
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,123
It's because of curiosity

456
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:25,521
I'm looking for "Flower Kid"

457
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,220
Because it's my duty

458
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:29,725
So there's no conflict between us

459
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,168
Boss, 2!

460
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:36,029
How dare you sell stolen chickens?

461
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,908
You have made me confused!

462
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:40,107
2, 3.1 kg

463
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:46,681
Let me handle you!

464
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:50,343
Please go outside
if you want to fight!

465
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,185
"Flower Kid" Who's he?

466
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:54,984
You're beating him

467
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:57,690
The money is mine

468
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:58,954
Where's my money?

469
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,360
Useless guy, chicken thief

470
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,130
Why do you beat my idol?

471
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:07,761
You said you'll hit him

472
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,270
each time you see him?

473
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,937
He's my idol "Flower Kid"

474
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:15,171
You're "Flower Kid"?

475
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:16,879
I'm not!

476
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:18,437
He denies it

477
00:35:20,384 --> 00:35:22,818
Please go out if you want to fight

478
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:24,551
Why does he look like this?

479
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:26,155
He has retired

480
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:27,814
Why do you steal chickens?

481
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,459
I keep them!

482
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,528
Then you're really "Flower Kid"

483
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:33,163
Me!

484
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:36,164
Fantastic... Iet's talk!

485
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,064
You make me lost my face

486
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,171
Hit both the front and the back

487
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,007
Come on... this way...!

488
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:47,306
I'll made no concession

489
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,467
I'll beat you!

490
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,085
Come for the avenging!

491
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,317
He's carrying weapons

492
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,860
Can't be seen?

493
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,328
I dare not do this again!

494
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:15,471
I'll kill you if you dare!

495
00:36:18,042 --> 00:36:19,441
Please sit, he's my boss!

496
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:21,536
He's my boss!

497
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:22,378
Who's it?

498
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,275
Yes!

499
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,742
You're his boss?

500
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:30,554
Say yes!

501
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:31,918
Yes!

502
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:34,452
This is...!

503
00:36:36,827 --> 00:36:38,488
Is there any FBl?

504
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:40,662
No!

505
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:43,333
This is my Godson

506
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,070
Where's your brother?

507
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,600
I almost need to stay in hospital!

508
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,273
For repairing!

509
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:53,937
I'm his boss,

510
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:57,808
I've to deal with it

511
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:01,682
Which gang do you belong to?

512
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,348
I'm 4 times 100 metres champion

513
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:12,190
Fierce?

514
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,791
I don't believe, you are so fat!

515
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:17,900
And you?

516
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:23,136
Listen to my family poem

517
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:27,641
We're playing majong
and I'm the banker

518
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:31,976
It won't be a drawn this time

519
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:34,615
He's reciting the poem!

520
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:36,776
Recite one to him

521
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,419
I don't know any

522
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,854
Just say anything

523
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,650
1,2,3,4,5,6,7

524
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,024
You look like a chicken

525
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,995
7,6,5,4,3,2,1

526
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:51,225
I'm the best of everything

527
00:37:54,238 --> 00:37:55,136
Phoney stuff

528
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:56,673
Boss, beat him!

529
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,168
Fighting is not popular now,

530
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:00,503
Iet's talk

531
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,876
I want them to join my gang club

532
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:06,012
Which one is better,

533
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:07,980
Jockey Club or Lion Club?

534
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,052
I think YWCA is the best

535
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:12,380
YWCA!

536
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,152
He's fooling you, beat him!

537
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:18,359
No one can move before
I've thrown the cup!

538
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,025
But if I do?

539
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:22,392
I'll move of course

540
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:24,195
I throw!

541
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:25,494
I move!

542
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,169
Throw the cup!

543
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:29,398
Not yet the right time!

544
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:31,935
It's time now, beat him!

545
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:33,999
Beat!

546
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:55,255
Boss!

547
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,460
Help, Boss!

548
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:05,006
He can't save you!

549
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:23,155
Don't go,

550
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,261
I'll get help!

551
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,166
Go away?

552
00:39:30,334 --> 00:39:32,029
Haven't you seen this before?

553
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,192
Go! Go!

554
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:42,610
Let's go back to our business,
where're we?

555
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,412
I haven't said anything!

556
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,606
You want to play dirty tricks again?

557
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:48,843
I was just asking about him!

558
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,008
What has he said?

559
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:51,415
Speak up, "Flower Kid"!

560
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,950
I was a "Flower Kid"
when I was young

561
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:00,831
But now I'm old, 5 years ago

562
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:04,033
One night, I want back to the inn

563
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:14,604
I was told that your Kung Fu is good

564
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,974
Yes, my Kung Fu is good

565
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:21,183
But not in bed, please get out!

566
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,214
Even undress her undercover

567
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:25,916
How is her body?

568
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:26,987
I haven't seen it!

569
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:27,852
Very stupid!

570
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,720
You should have at least a glance!

571
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:33,330
But it made me more angry

572
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:37,634
I want you to kill my husband

573
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,494
You've found

574
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:42,204
the wrong guy

575
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:46,036
I never killed innocent people

576
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,342
Get out!

577
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,273
Why should this come on me?

578
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,045
It's ridiculous to kill her own husband

579
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,244
Have you gone to bed?

580
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:02,153
No, I threw her out of bed

581
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,089
You bitch!

582
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:12,596
I won't hesitate if your
husband wants me to kill you

583
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,063
Get out!

584
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,302
Well-done!

585
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:21,740
You're merciless!

586
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,307
So she tried her best

587
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,347
to kill me

588
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,982
And she'll never stop!

589
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,914
Where can she get so much money?

590
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,748
That's very easy

591
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,858
for a woman to earn!

592
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:41,027
So she has found a millionaire

593
00:41:57,381 --> 00:41:58,370
Another poor guy!

594
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,673
Remember,

595
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,046
never offend any woman

596
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,347
Lady, please sit!

597
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:07,283
I don't like sitting, go away!

598
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:08,950
I'm very angry!

599
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:12,926
Who makes her angry?

600
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:15,691
That fat guy tied me on a tree!

601
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:19,296
I've told you

602
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,335
Not to offend any woman

603
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:24,033
I... what shall I do?

604
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,768
He has to apologize

605
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,103
or he'll die

606
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:32,006
Do you hear, go!

607
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:32,671
I?

608
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,340
Don't do the same!

609
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:36,350
Come here...!

610
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,020
Say sorry to her

611
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:42,750
Let her say in joy!

612
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:43,859
What shall I do?

613
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,996
Listen, just do whatever she likes

614
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,325
Understand? Go!

615
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:05,313
Disgusting!

616
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:06,980
Filthy couple!

617
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,481
Well, where are the jewels?

618
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,754
I don't know!

619
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:20,391
Maybe it's her?

620
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,513
Daring! When will we go away?

621
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,120
It'll be very soon!

622
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,618
Well, where are the jewels?

623
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,349
Over there

624
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:52,794
In fact, why let "Flower Kid"
bother you?

625
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,193
He's death won't cause you any good

626
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,067
And his living won't cause
you any bad neither

627
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:00,700
I must want him die

628
00:44:06,443 --> 00:44:07,307
He's coming

629
00:44:18,522 --> 00:44:20,114
So you're "Golden Killer"

630
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:23,491
And they?

631
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,955
My men!

632
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:28,098
Where's the money?

633
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:32,767
I want you to kill...!

634
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,927
Not you, but a woman,

635
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:36,900
I come for her

636
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:48,209
She wants me to kill
"Flower Kid", right?

637
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,481
Wait, there's something more!

638
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,148
This letter is fore you!

639
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:37,292
The "Golden Killer"

640
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:38,366
has not come yet!

641
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:39,524
He'll, and there's another killer

642
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,331
waiting for me

643
00:45:42,706 --> 00:45:44,867
I can never escape this time!

644
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:53,846
We'll finish them one by one

645
00:45:54,017 --> 00:45:56,485
I'm boss, open the door!

646
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:03,321
Where have you been

647
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:04,620
Iast night?

648
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,619
Me? Wait!

649
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,438
I... I have done it!

650
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:20,104
What have you done?

651
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:23,371
You want me to make her happy

652
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:26,210
But I haven't told you to...!

653
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:30,850
You idiot! Come here...!

654
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:33,522
You can't go,

655
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,317
we can't do without you!

656
00:46:37,094 --> 00:46:37,890
Why do you want to leave?

657
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,893
waiting for him!

658
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,429
Really? Let me handle him

659
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,025
You can't, it's useless!

660
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:48,165
He can hit the target
from a long distance!

661
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,941
He's nothing comparing

662
00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:54,270
to my friend!

663
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:55,843
This is my friend "Flying Dagger"!

664
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:58,277
He's no.8 of his family

665
00:46:58,582 --> 00:47:02,484
We are good friends

666
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,946
Is he alright?

667
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,448
Certainly

668
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:10,916
One day,

669
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:11,924
a fly threw across his face

670
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:14,359
You guess what has happened?

671
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:15,429
What?

672
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:16,497
No more fly!

673
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,997
So he can hit his target
from a long distance!

674
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,763
Then we can stand further away?

675
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:25,703
It's a long distance

676
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:28,106
from the inn here

677
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,041
Fantastic...

678
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:31,875
I'll make him out

679
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,378
His dagger is so fierce?

680
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,346
Just listen to his poem

681
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,546
Chicken and dogs run away
when they hear me

682
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:43,420
No one can escape
from my dagger

683
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,061
Please!

684
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:52,832
Just over there, wait for me

685
00:47:55,772 --> 00:47:56,466
Where's he?

686
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,870
Over there, you see?

687
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:01,305
Who?

688
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,742
It's him, look!

689
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:05,604
The one next to him!

690
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,058
We should have

691
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,352
Iet Fatso try it!

692
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:19,392
I won't hit a handicapped!

693
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,430
You can't judge by the face!

694
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:54,554
How are you?

695
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:55,762
I'm alright!

696
00:49:02,906 --> 00:49:05,272
I'll find a coffin,

697
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:07,801
you try to save him

698
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,550
Don't go away!

699
00:49:24,528 --> 00:49:26,052
Find a place to hide!

700
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:28,026
It's useless you should
hide yourself

701
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:30,096
It's useless,

702
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,495
I've tried it!

703
00:49:32,402 --> 00:49:33,391
Just eat

704
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:34,832
if you can!

705
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:35,937
I've bring you DDT

706
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,472
to kill the mosquitoes

707
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:40,035
Is it safe?

708
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,236
Absolutely

709
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:44,573
This!

710
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,978
But you haven't told me yet!

711
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,213
It's jail!

712
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,659
I'm forced to do this

713
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,629
We'll be in trouble
if I don't catch you

714
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,427
You'll be safe

715
00:50:05,602 --> 00:50:06,762
and I'll be out of trouble!

716
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,768
This is for our

717
00:50:08,939 --> 00:50:09,735
mutual benefit, right?

718
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:10,634
No!

719
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:11,739
Who said so?

720
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:13,107
I did!

721
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:17,981
How dare you do

722
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:19,672
such filthy things!

723
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:21,041
You know I'm not clean

724
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,748
He's a person to be respected

725
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:26,351
And you treat him like this

726
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,458
This string is very loose!

727
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:30,758
Don't run away!

728
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:43,696
All you know

729
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,035
is money

730
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,801
And you're always

731
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:49,036
dreaming of fame

732
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,941
Fame?
I've never wanted to be famous!

733
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:51,842
Excuse me

734
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:53,039
No!

735
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:57,446
For fame is better than for money

736
00:50:57,788 --> 00:50:59,255
You can't be famous as "Flower Kid"

737
00:51:01,091 --> 00:51:02,683
How is he now?

738
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:04,620
Is "Flower Kid" your friend?

739
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:06,126
Shut up, get out!

740
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:08,828
What's wrong with "Flower Kid"?

741
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:13,434
Something wrong with your eyes?

742
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:16,071
Again, which one of
you is "Flower Kid"?

743
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:17,939
I'm, so what?

744
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:21,804
You ain't, where's he?

745
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:23,206
I don't tell you!

746
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:28,750
You!

747
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:29,544
Beat him!

748
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:31,186
I won't spare you next time!

749
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:32,551
I... dare not!

750
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:34,121
We are not finished!

751
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,342
Take this!

752
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:00,705
Go!

753
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:18,624
Get "Flower Kid" to help you

754
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,963
if you want to avenge

755
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:23,863
It's all your fault!

756
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,150
Your fault!

757
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:38,047
It's all because

758
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,050
you admit yourself as "Flower Kid"

759
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,416
Always want to be known

760
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:45,228
Now, you have got it!

761
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:48,965
You'll be hurt!

762
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:51,627
It's so difficult that
we've found a gold coin

763
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:56,271
You do good

764
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:58,671
in the brothel

765
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:00,907
But now who'll sympathies you?

766
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:10,811
Come with me!

767
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:32,505
This is my house!

768
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:36,267
When I was 5 years old

769
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:40,506
Father, died in front of the gate

770
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:50,052
And mother died when I was seven

771
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:55,823
I become a hard labour
in order to survive

772
00:53:55,999 --> 00:53:59,298
My life was even worse than pigs

773
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:04,939
But I still haven't cheated anybody

774
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:08,609
But still I was despised by others

775
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:14,081
I swear I must be

776
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,445
famous one day

777
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:19,515
So that everybody will know about me

778
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:22,819
I admire "Flower Kid"

779
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:28,296
and his behaviour

780
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:30,830
What's wrong to imitate him?

781
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:35,334
Tell me what's wrong about it?

782
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:54,280
You're not wrong!

783
00:55:01,998 --> 00:55:03,966
I'll help you to fulfill your wish

784
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:05,760
But "Flower Kid"...!

785
00:55:06,236 --> 00:55:09,262
I can make him strong again

786
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:11,306
That shortly gun fighter
is very fierce!

787
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:15,570
Fierce? He's nothing
compare to my old friend

788
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,314
How can you borrow it?

789
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,974
Not borrow but steal!

790
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:27,484
Quiet or you'll wake him up

791
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:30,251
He's a deaf, close the door!

792
00:55:43,907 --> 00:55:44,635
He's over there!

793
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:45,570
What did you say?

794
00:55:45,742 --> 00:55:46,606
He's over there!

795
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:48,835
I heard you, don't have to shout

796
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:56,684
Don't you afraid he'll see you?

797
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,878
Why? He's blind!

798
00:56:02,926 --> 00:56:03,790
Go ahead and find!

799
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:10,695
Have you found the gun?

800
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:11,834
What's the hurry?

801
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:13,595
What are you looking for then?

802
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:14,828
The money!

803
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,464
Where's the gun?

804
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,197
Inside the pillow box!

805
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,046
You seem very familiar
with the place

806
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,013
He's my father-in-law

807
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:29,808
You don't have to
steal but borrow!

808
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,951
I have sold his daughter

809
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:34,387
You stingy fellow!

810
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:54,540
How about me?

811
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,123
Your're grent

812
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:19,465
How can you fart at this moment?

813
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:22,070
He's blind and he's deaf!

814
00:57:31,681 --> 00:57:34,343
He's looking for you
from the smell!

815
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:40,152
Fatso!

816
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,481
Someone is here!

817
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,020
Father-in-law, it's me!

818
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:48,630
It's bad, he can't hear

819
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:50,229
Hide yourself!

820
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:02,911
I haven't died

821
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:03,670
No!

822
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:04,711
This gun is in good condition!

823
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:05,905
It's better than nothing!

824
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,175
Our hero "Flower Kid"
will depend on it!

825
00:58:09,352 --> 00:58:10,410
Will he use it?

826
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:14,853
He has to!

827
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:17,851
We've been looking for you

828
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:19,460
We have found you at last!

829
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:24,491
Please go inside!

830
00:58:26,302 --> 00:58:27,564
Thank god that

831
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:30,001
we've found "Flower Kid"!

832
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:34,934
You're wrong, I'm not "Flower Kid"

833
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:38,141
Don't deny, listen to me!

834
00:58:38,414 --> 00:58:40,314
We're poor farmers,

835
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:42,178
I had 2 sons and a daughter

836
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:46,015
And we've a few acres of land too

837
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:49,858
One day, there came a vagabond, he...!

838
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,823
He wanted to rape my daughter

839
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:57,564
But my sons heard it
and fought with him

840
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,735
But they were inferior to him!

841
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:07,432
He killed my 2 sons!

842
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,073
Who's he beast?

843
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:16,250
He's Chung Fa-pai,
the "Golden Killer"

844
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:23,385
You are the only one to kill him

845
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:28,521
No... "Flower Kid"
has already dead!

846
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:32,200
Hero... please come back,
listen to me!

847
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:33,767
I know it's very difficult

848
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:35,632
to have you here

849
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:41,904
We know this is

850
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,136
too little for you!

851
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:44,075
I won't accept your money

852
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,044
if I can help

853
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:48,080
Sorry I'm not able help!

854
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,378
Please wait,

855
00:59:50,553 --> 00:59:52,316
wife, go ahead!

856
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:54,715
Wait,

857
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:56,916
I've something else for you!

858
00:59:58,561 --> 00:59:59,858
Chiu-lin!

859
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,958
You're the only chance we've got!

860
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:25,548
Open the door!

861
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:28,953
Although I'm not pretty,
I'm still a girl

862
01:00:29,425 --> 01:00:31,450
My brother died because of me

863
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,622
If you don't help us,

864
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:36,495
they couldn't rest in peace

865
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:39,527
And my parents will blame for this

866
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:43,103
Please help me, hero!

867
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,007
I can't...

868
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:54,547
please don't, open the door!

869
01:00:57,053 --> 01:01:01,854
Hero, please don't go...!

870
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,089
No!

871
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:11,331
You have given her to him

872
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:16,294
You!

873
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,771
She's my fiance,

874
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:21,273
tomorrow we'll get married

875
01:01:21,778 --> 01:01:27,045
How can you do this...? Speak!

876
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:35,149
Chiu-lin...!

877
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:39,825
You are too stupid!

878
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:44,398
The hero hasn't even touched her!

879
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:51,132
Is it true?

880
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:52,171
Yes!

881
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,837
I'm sorry...!

882
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:01,241
Chiu-lin!

883
01:02:03,686 --> 01:02:06,678
"Chung Fa-pai" The "Golden Killer"!

884
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:21,560
You acted very well!

885
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:22,963
Excellent show!

886
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,035
Happy co-operation

887
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:26,434
They're better actors than you

888
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:29,802
How about me?

889
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,038
You haven't fainted yet?

890
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:32,010
And no tears neither!

891
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:32,772
And haven't dead!

892
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:33,916
You still want the money?

893
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,675
He's fainted!

894
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:38,286
Pay...!

895
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:39,950
Wake up

896
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:41,147
Go!

897
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,102
Pour the water!

898
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:11,080
We've succeeded the first stage

899
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:13,722
Now we've to give him
back his confidence

900
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:20,627
I got these kids

901
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:21,786
to fight the old man

902
01:03:22,565 --> 01:03:25,090
Remember, stand a blow for a coin

903
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:26,663
But 5 coins will be deducted

904
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:28,497
if you hit him

905
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:31,232
Don't let me lose my money!

906
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:32,396
Yes!

907
01:03:32,575 --> 01:03:33,564
You should know what to do!

908
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:41,039
Help...!

909
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:46,847
Help... help!

910
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:49,957
Why don't you ask me who they are?

911
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:51,823
Who are they?

912
01:03:52,195 --> 01:03:53,628
"Golden Killer's" men

913
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,460
Line up all of you...!

914
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:08,237
One blow!

915
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:10,641
Good, well done!

916
01:04:12,048 --> 01:04:13,106
I can't!

917
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,016
Look, fantastic!

918
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:21,679
Two!

919
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,200
Another one!

920
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:39,438
Very fierce indeed, good posture!

921
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:40,505
Of course!

922
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:45,870
Four altogether!

923
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:02,094
Come on!

924
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:04,598
No more!

925
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:14,376
Well, I'll give you $10
if you can hit me!

926
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:54,113
You still owe me $4!

927
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,915
I'll never work for you again!

928
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:58,215
Go

929
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,518
Get lost...!

930
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,194
"Flower Kid" still a hero!

931
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:16,429
One against four!

932
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:18,435
No!

933
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:21,801
He's exhausted!

934
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:24,102
So we have to train him!

935
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:25,372
How?

936
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,815
This dog has been
starved for 3 days!

937
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:37,217
Tie this beef on his body,

938
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:39,418
he'll have to run

939
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:40,619
Where shall we tie it?

940
01:06:40,896 --> 01:06:42,420
At the back!

941
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:43,858
How?

942
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:44,894
You're too stupid!

943
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:46,523
Watch!

944
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:49,702
Just like this!

945
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:51,770
It's alright

946
01:06:52,742 --> 01:06:54,073
now

947
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:57,442
The dog doesn't chase!

948
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:00,111
Stupid, the dog's being tied up!

949
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:01,340
Try to release it!

950
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:25,798
Be strong, young man!

951
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:36,551
Mama!

952
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,983
Mama!

953
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,342
Music!

954
01:09:52,454 --> 01:09:53,318
Stop...!

955
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:55,320
It's funeral music!

956
01:09:56,792 --> 01:09:57,622
Make it stronger!

957
01:11:01,123 --> 01:11:02,852
Don't be afraid, we're here!

958
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:30,251
Let me try!

959
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:31,545
Let me try!

960
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:38,659
I have told you let me have a try!

961
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:41,028
I really mean it! Come on...!

962
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:04,374
We have made it!

963
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:11,689
Hero, congratulations!

964
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,384
I knew you'll make it again!

965
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:14,620
What did you say?

966
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,158
We can go to find
the "Golden Killer" now

967
01:12:24,707 --> 01:12:25,901
Daddy!

968
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,114
Ta-pao! Erh-pao!

969
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:35,215
Why you killed

970
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:37,716
my 2 sons?

971
01:13:59,835 --> 01:14:00,961
So it's your

972
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:02,296
two fellows

973
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:03,768
What? Singing opera?

974
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:06,272
I hate this guy

975
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:10,237
See what you have

976
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:12,113
put on!

977
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,615
You have put on the wrong dress!

978
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:22,149
What's so funny, general?

979
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:31,860
How dare you scolded me!

980
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:33,899
Which one do you want?

981
01:14:34,169 --> 01:14:35,966
If you wish, you can
fight them all!

982
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:47,171
What are you doing?

983
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:48,111
I was hit...

984
01:14:48,283 --> 01:14:49,045
Who's he...?

985
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:50,207
The one dressed in black

986
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:51,550
Why don't you beat him back!

987
01:15:05,634 --> 01:15:06,601
Miracle!

988
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,028
Accident!

989
01:15:13,408 --> 01:15:13,999
You are smart!

990
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:15,108
Of course,

991
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:16,639
I've scared them to death

992
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,078
It's your turn now!

993
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:32,187
My ideas always work

994
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:34,462
It's alright!

995
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:35,728
It's alright!

996
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:02,649
Another accident again!

997
01:17:00,582 --> 01:17:03,244
It's none of my business, go

998
01:17:07,189 --> 01:17:08,679
Be careful!

999
01:17:14,463 --> 01:17:16,363
I'm sorry,

1000
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:17,862
it's just an accident!

1001
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:26,198
Cool!

1002
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:29,071
Even a hero will be drowned
in women's tenderness

1003
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:33,405
I have found "Flower Kid" for you

1004
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,040
Where's he?

1005
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:36,542
Money first

1006
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,149
Cash, no credit!

1007
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:41,046
Go and get the money!

1008
01:17:41,556 --> 01:17:42,488
Yes!

1009
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:47,627
She looks okay,

1010
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:49,024
why "Flower Kid" is afraid of?

1011
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:53,399
You can never judge
a woman by her look!

1012
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:56,463
Madam

1013
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:01,572
Where's "Flower Kid"?

1014
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:03,911
Hero, come out, man!

1015
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:19,553
Strange, I turn hard
when seeing her

1016
01:18:19,728 --> 01:18:21,753
But you turn soft?

1017
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:24,894
I'm just talking about our hearts!

1018
01:18:26,468 --> 01:18:28,595
In fact, she's not frightening!

1019
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:31,168
Go ahead and slap her

1020
01:18:31,506 --> 01:18:32,530
I won't slap a woman

1021
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:34,542
You're too useless, watch me!

1022
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:43,977
I can't!

1023
01:18:49,691 --> 01:18:50,658
Nice job you've done!

1024
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:55,394
You can still come here alive

1025
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:57,862
But you'll die here today

1026
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,107
I'm the one who make you die here

1027
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:10,676
Bull shit, why don't you try!

1028
01:19:11,012 --> 01:19:13,537
I come this time to challenge you

1029
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:16,646
But I'll surely win!

1030
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:19,352
Win? Who do you think you are?

1031
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:20,781
Yes! Beat him!

1032
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,351
How's that?
I learnt this from you

1033
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:59,221
If your men haven't
trapped me last time

1034
01:19:59,394 --> 01:20:01,225
I wouldn't have fallen into water!

1035
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:03,121
Leave him to me, master!

1036
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:05,131
How dare you call him master?

1037
01:20:05,433 --> 01:20:06,263
Master!

1038
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:08,466
Leave this one

1039
01:20:08,837 --> 01:20:09,735
to me

1040
01:20:13,608 --> 01:20:15,337
Are you ready to take my blow?

1041
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:27,113
Gone!

1042
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:31,817
You're right, this one is for you!

1043
01:20:34,563 --> 01:20:35,894
Go ahead! Go!

1044
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,539
Master, this one is for you!

1045
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:49,773
Me?

1046
01:20:59,154 --> 01:21:01,418
Go...!

1047
01:21:01,823 --> 01:21:03,154
I'll leave this place to you!

1048
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:05,816
Master can't do without me,

1049
01:21:14,903 --> 01:21:18,532
Don't be afraid, you look like a man!

1050
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,698
Smart, handsome,

1051
01:21:20,976 --> 01:21:23,035
young and ambitious

1052
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,303
How can you be destroyed

1053
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,504
by such a woman?

1054
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:28,114
Come in if you get guts!

1055
01:21:36,524 --> 01:21:38,515
Come on!

1056
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:42,363
Stupid!

1057
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:50,304
Have a drink and get her!

1058
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:52,805
Come on!

1059
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,243
Don't waste it

1060
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:38,337
Have you seen my friend Fatso?

1061
01:23:39,114 --> 01:23:40,103
Ghost!

1062
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:41,804
Why you beat him?

1063
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:42,780
Shut up!

1064
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:49,455
"Flower Kid" has handled the girl

1065
01:23:49,657 --> 01:23:51,056
Stand aside!

1066
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:55,889
Listen to me, it's true!

1067
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:02,267
Stop!

1068
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,522
General, come and help!

1069
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:37,170
Why do you beat me?

1070
01:24:37,472 --> 01:24:38,302
Where's our enemy?

1071
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,431
Over there!

1072
01:24:41,643 --> 01:24:43,941
Where else can you go?

1073
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:51,279
What do you want?

1074
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:52,112
He has come with his man!

1075
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:52,810
Where are they?

1076
01:24:52,987 --> 01:24:53,817
The one dressed in black

1077
01:24:57,325 --> 01:24:59,225
Don't be afraid, let me handle him

1078
01:25:02,764 --> 01:25:04,391
It's none of you business,
I just beat him!

1079
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:15,339
How dare you laugh at me!

1080
01:25:30,992 --> 01:25:32,084
I've eliminated my enemy

1081
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:33,318
I have eliminated mine too

1082
01:25:40,735 --> 01:25:42,726
Don't go, something
interesting is coming!

1083
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:43,563
What are you looking for?

1084
01:25:43,738 --> 01:25:45,899
Watch me catch the idiot

1085
01:25:46,074 --> 01:25:47,541
Idiot, where are you?

1086
01:25:47,709 --> 01:25:48,607
Come with me!

1087
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:53,003
Just in the front, come on...!

1088
01:25:57,285 --> 01:25:58,547
Where's the idiot?

1089
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:01,045
There's only me and you!

1090
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:02,955
So if it's not you, it'll be me!

1091
01:26:16,137 --> 01:26:17,126
Why did you do it?

1092
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:20,168
Sheriff put $5 on you!

1093
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:21,870
You do this just for $5

1094
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:25,371
I won't refuse money! Sheriff!

1095
01:26:28,249 --> 01:26:29,716
Sheriff! $5!
