1
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,637
The earth was sick ...

2
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,153
 and SkyArk was built.

3
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,958
The city in the clouds.

4
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,475
The monster came out of nowhere.

5
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,316
People fled to SkyArk.

6
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,037
But SkyArk was too small for all.

7
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,470
So they banished the poor and the orphans.

8
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,796
It was an uprising.

9
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,710
But SkyArk was more powerful.

10
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,748
The children of the rebels
were captured ...

11
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,558
 and they were given a
Brand for every sin of their parents.

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,358
They were exiled to Earth.

13
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,672
They built the camp of
Fallen and fought the monster.

14
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,834
I'm Rusty.

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,275
As their leader must
I give you hope.

16
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,789
The son of the leader of the rebels,
should be given the ultimate punishment:

17
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,071
A 13-fold time.

18
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,950
So I invented a legend:

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,158
A boy with 13 times
would come and save us ...

20
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,548
 someday

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,194
If you stay here, you die!

22
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,753
Come on! Immediately!

23
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,116
Let's go. Run!
Hurry Up!

24
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,154
Stay close to it! Los!

25
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,635
Run! Run!
- Where to?

26
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,712
The monsters are coming!

27
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,349
The camp of the Fallen.

28
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,914
Monsters are on the hunt!
On your item. Los.

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,835
Come on!

30
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,394
From the fort.

31
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,355
All in!
Quick! Now!

32
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,038
I was here first!
- Does not matter!

33
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,276
You're just a two, a four-I.

34
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,631
Hey coward, how many do you have?

35
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,671
Rusty, look! 13!

36
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,350
So it's you.
- Who am I?

37
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,598
So he's the 13?

38
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,798
The 13 has come!

39
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,715
Starting today, the monsters are afraid of us!

40
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,952
Monster!

41
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,999
It's your turn ...

42
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,028
I do not know ... - Do not worry!

43
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,799
I'm with you!

44
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,473
I do not know how you are ...

45
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,035
 I do not feel particularly safe.

46
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,031
Where is it?

47
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,188
He should be our Savior?

48
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,873
Monster Snack?

49
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,193
I show him how to do it.

50
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,309
Well done.

51
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,589
Beginner's luck!

52
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,511
I bring that to an end.

53
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,194
Ash! No!

54
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,879
Get out of here!

55
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,273
What was that?

56
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,516
On SkyArk you warned us.
Are you naughty ...

57
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,434
 send them down like the monsters.

58
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,389
Monster?

59
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,360
Horror stories for young children!

60
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,754
You wish!

61
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,197
The monsters live here below.

62
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,112
In Hive.

63
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,835
We hunt there during a new moon,
if they are weak.

64
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,949
Why?

65
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,314
The Blue drops!

66
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,159
He heals every wound.

67
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,715
The monsters hide him from us.

68
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,593
Once we have the Blue drops ...

69
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,157
 all our suffering is over now!

70
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,953
You can stop this.

71
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,158
Have you ever seen him? - No.

72
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,834
Now that you are there, this will change!

73
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,316
Why me? - Because ...

74
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,232
 I am only one. 8

75
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,988
Take a break!

76
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,509
Ash ...

77
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,752
 Thou shalt not go over the limit!

78
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,316
Okay ... You're always what you want.

79
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,673
Dad?

80
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,154
What's going on here?

81
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,955
Tell me the names ...

82
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,991
 or we will send your son into exile!

83
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,718
My son is into exile.

84
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,475
DAD!

85
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,918
NO! DAD!

86
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,877
Dad ... Dad!

87
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,794
Energy waste ... pretty!

88
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,915
Um ... hello?

89
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,675
Good morning, 13!

90
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,152
My name is Rags.

91
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,869
Here! Breakfast.
Ribs ... I think.

92
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,955
Hey, Rags! Will you help me?

93
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,872
Yes, please!

94
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,272
Wow! Stop!

95
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,949
Do you go out with my sister?

96
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,789
She asked me!

97
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,032
You're back before it gets dark!

98
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,589
That's enough! Hau starting!

99
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,228
Come here, birdie!

100
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,557
Do you like my skirt? - Yes!

101
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,152
Have I made from a parachute.

102
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,591
I sew for all.

103
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,638
Follow me ...

104
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,198
Come on up!

105
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,519
Where I help again?

106
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,149
Will see you already.

107
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,835
Caution Otherwise you hurt yourself!

108
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,073
Good!

109
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,677
Is easier than a bow ...
easy swing.

110
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,155
Like a sword?

111
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,834
That's just junk.

112
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,352
Maybe just for you.

113
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,118
You never smile?

114
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,118
Earlier times ...

115
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,914
You're really tough.

116
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,999
How I see it ...

117
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,672
 we are always eaten tomorrow.

118
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,993
So?

119
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,836
Do we still fun!

120
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,710
En Garde!

121
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,639
So you want to play?

122
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,672
Just back to you.

123
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,157
Everything okay?

124
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,193
So do you care yet!

125
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,115
Hold your chin up, Rags.

126
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,717
Let's go home!

127
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,995
Come on! She has a date with the 13 ...

128
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,074
 in him we are sure!
- I do not want to go.

129
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,114
It would be dangerous,
not to overhear!

130
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,073
Do you miss it?

131
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,639
Your home?

132
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,758
What is that?

133
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,751
So saw the earth from
SkyArk seen from ...

134
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,397
 and the Blue ...
that is the ocean.

135
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,513
My father had promised,
to go there with me.

136
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,318
A beautiful promise.

137
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,037
He can no longer comply.

138
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,308
It's not far from here ...

139
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,592
 maybe we go
times along the ocean. - Yes ...

140
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,989
Yes!

141
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,749
I go ahead and you kill all the monsters.

142
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,754
Deal?

143
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,833
It's a deal!

144
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,593
What was that?

145
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,956
Stop it!

146
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,559
This is not funny anymore!

147
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,948
Come on!

148
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,199
13l

149
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,029
Cool sword ... - Yes!

150
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,713
The handle must be serious,
for the balance.

151
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,839
Thus, it will be easier.

152
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,673
Yes!

153
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,392
I still remember
my first day.

154
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,030
I can not stay. - What?

155
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,790
I go to the ocean.

156
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,109
Look ...

157
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,557
 so we hunt monsters.

158
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,233
And no boys.

159
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,676
How So? But are a cute couple ...

160
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,912
Sometimes, when it's quiet ...
I can hear it.

161
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,279
I can hear the waves on the coast.
- He is so close?

162
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,359
Just because something is close,
it is still not easy.

163
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,077
Do Not Worry. You come out already.

164
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,318
Lily ... it's broken again.

165
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,234
I believe the 13 does not like me.

166
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,712
He's just shy.

167
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,357
Shall I tell you a secret?

168
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,838
He told me,
that you're really brave.

169
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,029
Yes?

170
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,709
You are soon ready for
the hunt for the drop.

171
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,711
He's a gutsy guy!

172
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,679
Please!

173
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,669
HEY "

174
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,829
 Did you Birdie and
seen my sister?

175
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,155
MONSTER!

176
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,590
Camp of the Fallen ...
on the walls!

177
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,918
Do not be crazy!
Let me go! That's Ember.

178
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,474
Ember! Hurry Up!

179
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,437
That's fine ...
- Is she all right?

180
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,798
Where's Birdie?

181
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,432
I thought that 13 could save us ...

182
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,559
No more stories!
And no lies.

183
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,073
She dies.

184
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,555
We have to save them.

185
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,999
What can I do?

186
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,880
There are healing! - Where?

187
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,990
In Hive, Rags.

188
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,438
The Blue drops?

189
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,588
Rags!

190
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,390
It has always brought me luck.

191
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,750
Take care of yourself!

192
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,629
Lily ...

193
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,911
 for Ash ...
- I'll bring them back.

194
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,312
How do you know,
that does that stuff?

195
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,192
I do not know.

196
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,517
Maybe just a myth.

197
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,030
Invented so that the
Can people hope.

198
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,513
A terrible hope.

199
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,230
I also think, however, we
all need to believe in something.

200
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,590
You and Ash, you were ever ...

201
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,038
 together?

202
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,034
We are still together.

203
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,472
We were the first here.

204
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,357
I promised to protect them.

205
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,033
And you know what?

206
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,678
I think she protected me.

207
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,676
Apparently my father was a traitor.

208
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,039
That's right!

209
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,278
One of the best!
He saved my dad.

210
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,831
Has risked his life for the uprising.

211
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,233
They would have brought almost SkyArk basis.

212
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,192
Yes, almost! - We come
be fine with a building.

213
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,797
And ... only a few monsters? - Exactly!

214
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,392
Only a few monsters.

215
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,429
Come!

216
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,989
Back!

217
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,835
Rusty!

218
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,478
She looked like a human being.

219
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,958
I thought she sees
me in the dark.

220
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,109
Perhaps needs glasses!

221
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,272
All right?
- There is nothing.

222
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,312
This heals the Blue drops.

223
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,354
Let's go.

224
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,876
Who built this?

225
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,873
Monster!

226
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,193
Okay ... but no people.

227
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,514
Go to the stairs! I draw him
from and you attack from behind.

228
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,713
To kill a monster,
you have to be a monster.

229
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,916
Be a Monster!

230
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,432
Come on!

231
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,794
Now! Do it!

232
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,989
Rusty!

233
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,229
Farewell, Ember ...

234
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,957
 here is Mister Monster.

235
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,835
He will save us, right?

236
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,835
So be it, right?

237
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,553
You're just a stupid doll!

238
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,639
I'm sorry.

239
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,392
I did not mean.

240
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,875
That's my camp!
- I'm sorry.

241
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,033
Go away! - I
but can not go anywhere!

242
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,188
My name is ...
- No names!

243
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,193
Why not?
- Because I say so!

244
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,314
It's cold down here.

245
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,031
Come on!
- Get out!

246
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,836
Hurry Up.

247
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,399
What was that? - You
are his lunch.

248
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,229
Monster?

249
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,233
The there really?

250
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,358
Did you just ...?

251
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,070
I call you skunk!

252
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,793
I have a mission.

253
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,189
Nice for you!

254
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,955
Will you help me? It's a secret mission.

255
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,156
What are you? A secret agent?

256
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,629
Yes!

257
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,474
Agent Skunk ... Wow!

258
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,310
Shall I my
Betrayed mission? - No!

259
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,990
Seeking the boy with the 13 times.

260
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,868
How So?

261
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,359
The rebels are waiting
that he comes back.

262
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,191
They gave me that.

263
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,598
What? - Look more closely.

264
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,034
What is that? - A Camera.

265
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,358
Pretty turned what?

266
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,472
How should these boys look like then?

267
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,559
Guess he's tall.

268
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,512
Bigger than me?
- Definitely.

269
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,991
And more ...
no offense.

270
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,798
How many times do you have?

271
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,988
Three.

272
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,918
And they still bleed.

273
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,473
Thank you! - Do you take constantly?

274
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,873
Yes! While peeing
I close my eyes.

275
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,999
The Ocean ...

276
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,879
HEY "

277
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,515
 to the fall?

278
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,509
Rags? What are you doing?

279
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,388
Rags ?!

280
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,712
You can add me yet
not leave here ...

281
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,479
Please!

282
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,879
Rags!

283
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,673
Let me back here.

284
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,678
Lily ...

285
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,557
Rags! - My Goodness ...

286
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,036
Was there a monster?
Do you have fought it? - Yes ...

287
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,597
Bring it to me!

288
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,751
I am not a good fighter ...

289
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,356
Everyone has a monster in itself.

290
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,073
That you have to let out!

291
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,589
And if it is eating me?

292
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,519
It's Your Monster!
Ready to control it.

293
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,718
Imagine that I am a monster ...

294
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,918
 was not a coward!

295
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,512
Try it from behind.

296
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,157
You have a try.

297
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,879
Do go!

298
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,513
I knew you
it does not have it.

299
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,993
Lily?

300
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,189
Nice to see you! - Pfft!

301
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,913
Lily!

302
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,758
People! Wait for me.

303
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,155
The monsters have come Rags.

304
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,152
They killed the children?

305
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,079
I am so sorry.

306
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,478
I'm not who you think.

307
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,872
I'm not a hero.

308
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,675
You believe in the 13 ...

309
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,077
 But what should I believe?

310
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,358
I do not have anything!

311
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,394
Wait! - You are a traitor.

312
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,315
Where are you going? - I will bring to an end,
what he could not.

313
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,070
Ehm, cool? May I see your times?

314
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,795
Go away!

315
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,635
Wow!

316
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,553
How mean.

317
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,119
She is right!
- They have in common.

318
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,119
Thank you!

319
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,874
Why us
brought this creepy place?

320
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,596
The boy with the 13 times ...

321
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,152
He was here?

322
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,593
 he is dead.

323
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,033
You know what I think?

324
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,231
No ... what?

325
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,508
Can you read minds?

326
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,195
Can you lift a plane?

327
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,394
No Chance!

328
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,392
She looked pretty weak ...

329
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,235
Ah! I know: you can not cook!

330
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,194
No! -Yeah!

331
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,273
She makes lunch!
- What are you talking about?

332
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,592
She said: Stop,
what you could not ...

333
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,593
What I could not?

334
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,117
Finally there is what
to eat! - Oh no ...

335
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,232
 the Blue drops!

336
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,199
Where are we going?

337
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,672
For Hive! - Cool! Essen.

338
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,275
We get no food, right?

339
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,874
Go back to camp.

340
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,832
I need to find Lily.

341
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,034
It is not worth it.

342
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,033
She is so mean!
Let's get off.

343
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,352
Hide behind the light ...
everything will be fine.

344
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,111
I know this from a book.

345
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,232
Stop it!

346
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,719
What you are doing?

347
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,677
It's not working.

348
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,314
Ash?

349
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,874
What are you doing here?
- And what are you doing here?

350
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,796
What a Iahmes Monster ...
is afraid of himself.

351
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,519
Thanks for the rescue! - Without me,
the monster had eaten you.

352
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,388
That would have ruined my home.

353
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,790
What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

354
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:57,832
What's wrong with you?

355
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,279
You live here?

356
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,958
Cool!

357
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,197
Did you see Lily?

358
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,798
You are too late.

359
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,029
Come, Skunk ...

360
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:15,153
How So? I like it here!

361
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,439
What is your name?

362
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,314
That's Skunk.
- Agent Skunk!

363
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,514
Oh really?

364
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,629
Yes! Take a look at my eye on.

365
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,916
Not so fast, sweetheart.

366
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,749
Where did you get that? - Bring it on!
That belongs to me.

367
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,479
That's Rusty Armor.

368
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,718
What do you care?

369
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,952
You let him die.

370
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,633
Come on ... we are looking for Lily.

371
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,590
We build the camp again.
- There is no longer camp.

372
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,468
You are cut down, I ran away.
There is nothing more.

373
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,472
Monsters are on the hunt.

374
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,916
Come on! We hunt monsters.

375
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,437
You too!

376
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,120
I bring you past the dog ...
but that was it!

377
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,319
Attention! The Chain!
Come on nothing!

378
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,240
Here you can kill almost everything.

379
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,393
Why did not the air?

380
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,553
To the light around looks
If only the darkness.

381
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,993
Yes ...

382
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,390
We need a decoy.

383
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,029
I vote to you!
If you sign up voluntarily?

384
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,233
You girls!

385
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,914
Argh, a staircase! - What?

386
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,428
Ash!

387
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,075
No! No!

388
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,712
A toy stone?

389
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,600
How childish ...
- Do not be sad.

390
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,478
It's just a monster.

391
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,036
Ash? Everything OK?

392
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,120
Yes! From now on you
Your placed on you.

393
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:57,552
Wait!

394
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,715
How many times do you have?

395
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,871
How many do you mean? - Many!

396
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,349
This is what counts, Agent Skunk!

397
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,434
Ash!

398
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,438
Do not let go ...

399
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,431
You can not hide forever.

400
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,390
Come with us!
- I'm sorry.

401
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,591
I do not kill more monsters.

402
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,317
Why kill Ash no monsters?

403
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,269
No Idea.

404
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,879
I do not think she's scared.

405
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:52,514
At least not from the monsters.

406
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,915
Ash? Do You Think,
Ash would go out with me?

407
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,599
God!

408
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,833
Hey!

409
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,716
Kit and Cat?

410
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,079
They were twins.

411
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,072
How sad.

412
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,233
Where have they gone?

413
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,920
Ouch! Oh God.

414
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,913
No noise more!

415
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,556
"SkyArk has the Monster
create - staying away "!

416
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,109
What does that mean?

417
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,668
This is a warning.

418
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,559
SkyArk ...

419
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,276
 they sent the monsters.

420
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,955
SkyArk created the monster.

421
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,039
What for?

422
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,639
Look at the poster!

423
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,469
This enabled them to people
imprison on SkyArk.

424
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,516
How dark.

425
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,393
You feed the monster with the kids.

426
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,878
My father is no traitor!

427
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,431
That is why they have been fighting.

428
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,071
I am ...

429
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:48,309
 Food?

430
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,512
Do you take on that?

431
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,756
You have eaten the children.

432
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,878
All shredded.

433
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,079
But no blood.

434
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,634
No bone.

435
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,673
They even ate the bones.

436
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:21,118
Find a mirror!

437
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,074
Okay ...

438
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,151
Please! Help me! Get me off!

439
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,912
I do not want to be eaten.

440
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,559
Too small!
- I know!

441
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:39,839
He is afraid of ugly monsters.

442
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,109
I want to go back.

443
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,913
I want to go back!

444
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,511
I want to go home.

445
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,876
Skunk! Remember your mission.

446
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,512
How many times did the boy?

447
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,869
What?

448
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,435
1 ... 2 ... - 13! Or?

449
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,552
Yes ... You are the hero?

450
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,792
We are the heroes!
- I knew it.

451
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,314
Agent Skunk,
are you food?

452
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,869
No Sir! I'm no food!

453
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:15,435
I'm a monster.

454
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,633
Where are you going?

455
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,159
And off you go!

456
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,389
Birdies doll ...

457
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,829
I understand ...

458
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,791
I'm a monster!

459
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,714
I can not believe it.

460
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,188
I'm a monster!

461
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,795
And I found you.

462
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,877
I'm a hero.

463
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,079
A great day!

464
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:27,995
Halt not!

465
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,356
I got to be a hero.

466
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,198
I'm going back with you, Agent Skunk.

467
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,835
You'll be a hero! I promise.

468
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,512
But first I have to find Lily.

469
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:42,114
We would have been on SkyArk friends?

470
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,192
Of course, Agent Skunk.

471
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:47,438
Yes Yes!

472
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,357
As brothers! - Yes!

473
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,555
The mask is you!
- Hurray!

474
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,036
Take it from never!

475
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,039
Sorry, Rags ...

476
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:10,430
 They even ate the bones.

477
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,315
No!

478
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,312
This means that she was here!

479
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,274
We find the Blue drops,
we also find Lily.

480
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,549
I'll help you to find them.

481
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,752
Oh no!

482
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,394
Rags?

483
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,633
Do not move!

484
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,792
Will everything be all right?

485
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,591
Tu but something!

486
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,909
Okay ...

487
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,437
 very slowly ...

488
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,109
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.

489
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,793
Everything will be fine.

490
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,870
I have failed.

491
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,391
Do not let go!

492
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,309
I have not finished the mission.
I have never brought anything to the end.

493
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,071
Everything will be fine.
Do you know why?

494
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,198
We are the heroes!

495
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,398
Together we are heroes!

496
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,149
As brothers ... - like brothers!

497
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,112
No!

498
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,510
Help! - Hold on!

499
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:25,948
Skunk!

500
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,432
His mask.

501
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:59,034
I go ahead and you kill all the monsters.

502
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,349
Deal?

503
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:03,834
It's a deal!

504
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,872
That's for Skunk!

505
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,393
The Blue drops!

506
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:18,040
That's him? -
The Blue drops!

507
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,033
We found him!

508
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,353
You found him.

509
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:28,312
I have found only you.

510
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:12,193
Rusty!

511
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,477
You're ...

512
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:36,675
SkyArk created the monster!

513
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,590
So you can the people
caught hold on SkyArk.

514
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,917
As a prison.

515
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:46,432
Kit and Cat ... they were twins.

516
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:51,914
No blood ... no bones.

517
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,031
She looked so human.

518
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:55,998
It seemed as could
they do not see me.

519
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,039
To kill a monster,
you have to be a monster.

520
01:11:59,480 --> 01:12:02,313
I'm a monster.

521
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,951
All of these monsters ...

522
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,913
 were children.

523
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,478
What have I done?

524
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,312
Rusty?

525
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:33,030
In order to survive in a world full of monsters ...

526
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,310
 You have to be a monster.

527
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,399
You can stop this.

528
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,150
The pain, the suffering.

529
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,633
Drinking!

530
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:03,633
When I connect to you ...

531
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:06,396
 I'm as good as dead.

532
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,832
I do not want to hurt you.

533
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,595
Rusty ... Stop it!

534
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:46,757
He is no longer Rusty!

535
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:49,672
Run! - Come on!

536
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,678
You can not hurt me!

537
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,072
Why are you running away from me?

538
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,028
How So?

539
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,631
Because of you I have remained.

540
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,074
Lily ...

541
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:51,193
To kill a monster,
must be a monster you!

542
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,038
Please, Rusty ...

543
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,592
 You are not a monster!
You can control it.

544
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,475
Please! You are my brother.

545
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,355
Ash! Bring Lily out of here.

546
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:24,913
Hurry Up!

547
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,679
No!

548
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:35,440
Go! Before the
Control lose! - No ...

549
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:37,716
 I will not leave you! - Go!

550
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,872
Do not do that. NO!

551
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,237
Lily!

552
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,314
Come!

553
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,959
Hey ...

554
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,112
Watch out! - Rags!

555
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,717
Skunk ?! - Lily!

556
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,952
You live!

557
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:43,193
That you have forgotten.

558
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:55,630
The real monsters are up there.

559
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,476
We go upstairs to SkyArk.

560
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,115
We finish what my father started.

561
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,199
Skunk ...
