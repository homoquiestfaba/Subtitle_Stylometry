00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,957
the clock and change things.

956
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,058
I'd forget about that

957
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,726
stupid swimming party.

958
00:41:35,926 --> 00:41:36,961
I'd forget about

959
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,729
Jesse Wade kissing me.

960
00:41:38,729 --> 00:41:40,264
I'd help granny more.

961
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,199
I'd watch her real careful

962
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,667
and make sure she wasn't ever,

963
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,436
ever sick with her heart.

964
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:17,268
>> Oh, come here, baby.

965
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,436
Oh, that's all right.

966
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:22,039
That's okay.

967
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,475
Tiger, listen to me, listen.

968
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,577
You're gonna be okay.

969
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:27,111
All right?

970
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,746
I know it's hard.

971
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:29,980
I'm here now.

972
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,949
You're gonna be okay, sweetie.

973
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:36,820
It's okay.

974
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,428
>> Dorie Kay, I'm really sorry

975
00:42:44,428 --> 00:42:45,396
about your mama.

976
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,898
>> Oh, well, thank you, Lonnie.

977
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,400
Now, how is corrina?

978
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:49,767
>> In bed.

979
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,502
She put on her mama's

980
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:51,869
old green nightgown,

981
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,038
and she's just lying

982
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,439
there crying her eyes out.

983
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,142
>> Oh, dear.

984
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:58,576
>> She don't want to talk to me.

985
00:42:59,009 --> 00:42:59,843
>> She don't want to talk

986
00:43:01,812 --> 00:43:03,514
to anybody, daddy.

987
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:11,288
>> Dorie Kay, what do you

988
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:12,756
do when somebody dies?

989
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:14,725
>> I don't want you

990
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,660
to worry about a thing, okay?

991
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,361
I'm gonna take care of

992
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:17,828
everything.

993
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:18,629
Honey, could you

994
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,698
go grab me a phone book?

995
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:21,498
And Lonnie, I need you

996
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,100
to fire up that stove.

997
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,435
We need to make a nice,

998
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,070
warm supper.

999
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,504
There's enough food here

1000
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,306
to feed an entire army.

1001
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:30,708
>> I'll get some wood.

1002
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,908
>> I didn't cry at the funeral.

1003
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,645
I had to be strong

1004
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,846
for mama and daddy.

1005
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,248
But nothing seemed real.

1006
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:16,620
And the only thing I wanted

1007
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:22,559
to hear no one could say.

1008
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:30,668
>> There's a lot of people

1009
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,869
at your house.

1010
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,605
>> I didn't need you

1011
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:35,706
to tell me that.

1012
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,107
That's why I'm here.

1013
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:43,480
I don't remember

1014
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,049
inviting you to join me.

1015
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,217
>> Tiger, do you want me

1016
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:49,053
to just disappear, or what?

1017
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:49,720
I don't know how

1018
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,955
I'm supposed to feel about you.

1019
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:53,257
>> I don't really want

1020
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:58,996
to talk about this right now.

1021
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,330
>> I'm real sorry

1022
00:45:00,931 --> 00:45:03,434
about miss Jewel.

1023
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:20,217
>> Yes, that sounds perfect.

1024
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,518
Okay.

1025
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:23,187
Well, you just bill it to me.

1026
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:27,658
Bye-bye. Now.

1027
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:31,095
Corrina? Corrina?

1028
00:45:31,528 --> 00:45:33,097
Oh, come on, now.

1029
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:36,333
That is enough, corrina.

1030
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,736
Now it's time to get up.

1031
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:40,838
Lonnie went to work,

1032
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:43,006
and tiger's got the house

1033
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,742
looking all beautiful.

1034
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:46,076
Now, come on,

1035
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,678
we have things to do.

1036
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,646
>> Ma's dead.

1037
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:51,648
She went to heaven.

1038
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:56,754
>> That's right.

1039
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,757
Ma is dead.

1040
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,125
But you are not.

1041
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,726
And Lonnie's not,

1042
00:46:02,726 --> 00:46:04,128
and I'm not,

1043
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:05,796
and neither is tiger.

1044
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:07,965
Now, what kind of mother lies

1045
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,199
in bed when she has

1046
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,968
a child to tend to?

1047
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:15,639
>> Oh, no. I've been bad.

1048
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:16,707
>> Corrina.

1049
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:19,209
>> Tiger's gonna be angry at me.

1050
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,178
>> I'm not mad at you, mama.

1051
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,247
And you're not a bad mother.

1052
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:25,415
You've just been real sad.

1053
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,687
>> Oh, baby.

1054
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:32,890
[ Sobbing ]

1055
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,366
>> Now, I made it

1056
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:43,867
real simple for you.

1057
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:45,269
There is the total.

1058
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,538
>> I don't rightly see,

1059
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:48,272
dorie Kay.

1060
00:46:48,539 --> 00:46:53,043
>> What don't you see, Lonnie?

1061
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:53,510
>> How do you know

1062
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,179
how much to pay?

1063
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,915
>> It's right here

1064
00:46:57,915 --> 00:46:59,349
on the paper, Lonnie.

1065
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,818
It clearly shows

1066
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,286
the total owing.

1067
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,821
>> Why, why do they give you all

1068
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,088
them numbers if they only want

1069
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:10,828
you to pay one of them?

1070
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,496
>> Now, I heard you talking

1071
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,798
about how many plant cuttings

1072
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:16,767
you've made at work, how many

1073
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,569
eggs the hens have laid.

1074
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:19,837
What is the difference

1075
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,505
between those numbers

1076
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,106
and these numbers?

1077
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,876
>> It's just different,

1078
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:27,744
dorie Kay.

1079
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:29,079
>> Why?

1080
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,415
>> Them numbers, when I look

1081
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:33,217
at them, well, they,

1082
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:38,755
they dance on the page.

1083
00:47:38,755 --> 00:47:40,324
>> They dance on the page.

1084
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,129
>> My mama always said

1085
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,631
I couldn't finish my arithmetic

1086
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:48,131
at school

1087
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:49,967
because I was retarded.

1088
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,335
I guess that must be it.

1089
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:00,477
I could talk to brother Dave.

1090
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:02,579
>> Yes, you could.

1091
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,648
You could talk to brother Dave.

1092
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:07,317
>> Like when your mama gave

1093
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:08,986
miss eula all them butterbeans

1094
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:10,520
last year, and miss eula made

1095
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,956
them calico curtains

1096
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,157
for tiger's bedroom.

1097
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,527
>> I'm not sure I see

1098
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:18,962
the connection, Lonnie.

1099
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:25,469
>> I could mow the church lawn

1100
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:26,803
one day a week,

1101
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:28,305
and brother Dave,

1102
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,007
he could write up these

1103
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:31,475
here bills one time each month.

1104
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:40,317
Do you think that's fair?

1105
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:43,720
>> Yes.

1106
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,723
Yes, I do.

1107
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:03,807
>> Mm-mm.

1108
00:49:03,807 --> 00:49:05,676
Honey, do you like that flavor?

1109
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:06,143
I could order you

1110
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,477
a different one.

1111
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:08,745
>> No, I'm fine.

1112
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,247
>> You're a little thing,

1113
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:11,048
like me.

1114
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:13,150
I fill up really fast, too.

1115
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,286
>> What did you want to discuss

1116
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,355
with me, aunt dorie Kay?

1117
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:20,257
>> Tiger, now that your granny

1118
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,559
has passed, things are gonna be

1119
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,561
quite different for you at home.

1120
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:27,164
>> I'm really gonna miss her.

1121
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:28,999
>> Well, I'm not

1122
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,034
just talking about that.

1123
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:32,869
>> Oh.

1124
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,438
>> Honey, your mama and daddy

1125
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,039
are the salt of the earth.

1126
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:36,907
They are sweet,

1127
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:38,642
and loving, and kind.

1128
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:39,242
But the most

1129
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:40,644
that can be asked of them

1130
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:41,278
is that they look

1131
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,246
after themselves.

1132
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:44,614
>> Now, I think with some help,

1133
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,416
they can do that.

1134
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:47,517
So I've decided

1135
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,319
to ask my maid, magnolia,

1136
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,520
to come out for the summer

1137
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:51,888
and to help them out.

1138
00:49:51,888 --> 00:49:53,690
>> Oh, that's good.

1139
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,559
>> Tiger, I've got an idea.

1140

1876
01:22:40,889 --> 01:22:41,756
