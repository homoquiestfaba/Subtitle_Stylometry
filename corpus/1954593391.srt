1
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,901
<i>This is Detective Robertson.</i>

2
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,470
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

3
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:53,405
- - He knows. He knows.

4
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:14,993
<i>Hello. It's Edith...</i>

5
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,361
<i>And Maisey.</i>

6
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,763
<i>We are not home right now.</i>

7
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,231
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

8
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,070
<i>Ooh.</i>

9
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,931
<i>What the hell is</i>
<i>all that noise?</i>

10
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,934
<i>Cheese and crackers,</i>
<i>keep it down.</i>

11
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,336
Really?

12
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,695
<i>Hey, is everything</i>
<i>okay in there?</i>

13
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,066
Y-Yeah.

14
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:18,410
<i>This is Detective Robertson.</i>

15
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:19,711
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

16
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,247
Where are you?

17
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:24,416
Where the hell are you?

18
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:26,585
You promised me
that you would help me.

19
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,553
You said you'd
get me out of this.

20
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,355
Now I'm so fucked.

21
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:33,024
Call me, asshole,
at least to tell me

22
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,360
that you don't give a shit
that you sold yourself

23
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:37,395
like all the other
disgusting cops.

24
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,366
And I'm on my own.

25
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,123
Shit.

26
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,126
Hello.

27
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:10,161
Hello?

28
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,162
Stop.

29
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,097
No.

30
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,383
<i>Everly.</i>

31
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,719
<i>What a surprise.</i>

32
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:44,355
<i>I assumed you'd go down</i>
<i>without a fight.</i>

33
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,857
<i>I was wrong.</i>

34
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,359
<i>I'm never wrong.</i>

35
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,629
<i>Did you get my present?</i>

36
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,168
<i>Open it.</i>

37
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,404
<i>I picked it out myself.</i>

38
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,273
<i>Your detective friend</i>
<i>is just the beginning.</i>

39
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,777
<i>221 Shaffer Avenue.</i>

40
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,248
What?

41
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,784
<i>My men are already there</i>

42
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,485
<i>waiting for my call.</i>

43
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,454
No, Taiko. No.

44
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,989
No, Taiko.
No. Please, no.

45
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:53,625
- <i> We had an agreement.</i>
- I'm begging, please.

46
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:56,227
<i>Do as your told, or I kill
your mother and daughter.</i>

47
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,729
Do anything you want to me,

48
00:09:57,731 --> 00:10:00,565
but, please, please,
just leave them out of this.

49
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,267
<i>I don't need your permission</i>

50
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,169
<i>to do anything I want with you.</i>

51
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,603
<i>I own you.</i>

52
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,772
- Yes. Please...
- <i> Or did you forget that?</i>

53
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,407
If you ever loved me...

54
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,476
<i>This isn't about love.</i>

55
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,244
<i>It's about honor.</i>

56
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,413
<i>You were taken to be a whore,</i>
<i>just like the others,</i>

57
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:17,982
<i>but when I saw you,</i>
<i>I said, "No,</i>

58
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,084
<i>she's special.</i>
<i>She's mine."</i>

59
00:10:20,086 --> 00:10:21,820
<i>But you betrayed me,</i>
<i>Everly."</i>

60
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,955
You... you're right.
You're right.

61
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,957
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

62
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:28,927
I-I was scared,

63
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,696
and I deserve to die
because of it.

64
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:33,231
But...

65
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,167
but, please,

66
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,636
please let them live.

67
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,506
Let them live, please.

68
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:46,945
<i>All right.</i>

69
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,147
<i>I will grant you your wish.</i>

70
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,217
<i>You will die in that
room tonight, Everly,</i>

71
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:54,485
<i>and I'll let</i>
<i>little Maisey live...</i>

72
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,487
Thank you. Thank...

73
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,022
<i>just long enough</i>

74
00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,392
<i>to earn back</i>
<i>what you've cost me.</i>

75
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,897
<i>I'm sure your daughter</i>
<i>will be very popular</i>

76
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:08,967
<i>with the older clientele.</i>

77
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,970
Fuck you.

78
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,139
Fuck you.

79
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:16,741
Fuck you!

80
00:11:16,743 --> 00:11:18,610
Fuck you!

81
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,793
Come on, Mom.
Pick up. Pick up.

82
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:38,229
<i>Hello.</i>

83
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:47,906
<i>- Hello. It's Edith...</i>
<i>- And Maisey.</i>

84
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,041
<i>We are not home right now.</i>

85
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,015
<i>Hello. It's Edith...</i>

86
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:58,116
<i>And Maisey.</i>

87
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,751
<i>We are not home right no...</i>

88
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,621
<i>Hello.</i>

89
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:04,689
<i>Hello?</i>

90
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,291
Mom.

91
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:07,859
- <i> Everly?</i>

92
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:09,360
There's men there.

93
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,795
There's men already there.

94
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,730
You need to take
Maisey and run.

95
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,432
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>are you talking about?</i>

96
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:15,867
<i>What men?</i>

97
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,435
- Mom...
- <i> Where are you?</i>

98
00:12:18,805 --> 00:12:20,405
<i>Who's that?</i>

99
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,273
- They're there.

100
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,542
<i>Everly, what have you</i>
<i>gotten us into?</i>

101
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:27,211
Mom, you got
to get out of the house

102
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,380
right now with Maisey, or
they're going to kill you both.

103
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:30,915
- <i> Okay, okay.</i>
- Come on.

104
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,283
<i>I'm going. I'm going.</i>

105
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,785
<i>Grandma.</i>

106
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,253
- Maisey.
- <i> I need you to be quiet.</i>

107
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,288
<i>Where are we going?</i>
<i>Who's out there?</i>

108
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:41,826
<i>Shh. Out the door.</i>

109
00:12:41,828 --> 00:12:44,729
<i>We are going for a ride.</i>
<i>Follow me.</i>

110
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,300
<i>While we are in the car,</i>
<i>scoot over.</i>

111
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,508
- - Mom?

112
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,811
<i>Maisey.</i>
- Mom?

113
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:02,246
<i>- Maisey, are you okay?</i>
<i>- I'm okay.</i>

114
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,282
<i>It's going to be</i>
<i>all right, baby.</i>

115
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,483
<i>Keep your head down,</i>

116
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:07,685
<i>and hand the phone to Grandma.</i>

117
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,754
<i>Put on your seat belt.</i>

118
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,489
<i>Good job, baby.</i>

119
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:14,625
<i>Everly, what the hell</i>
<i>is going on?</i>

120
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,595
Mom, you need to keep driving.

121
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,597
Don't stop for anyone.

122
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,266
Meet me at McCoy Park downtown.

123
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,868
- <i> I'm calling the police.</i>
- No.

124
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,269
He owns the police.

125
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,772
<i>This is madness.</i>
<i>What do you mean?</i>

126
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,173
<i>Who owns the police?</i>

127
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,810
No time.

128
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,979
<i>Four years ago, you disappear,</i>

129
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,149
<i>and I haven't heard from
you in four years, Everly,</i>

130
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,650
<i>four years.</i>

131
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,353
- <i> - ...men showing up</i>

132
00:13:42,355 --> 00:13:44,389
<i>at my home in the
middle of the night</i>

133
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:46,157
<i>to kill me and Maisey.</i>

134
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,625
<i>What have you done?</i>

135
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:50,294
<i>And why would we want</i>
<i>to see you, anyway?</i>

136
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:53,231
<i>First you abandon</i>
<i>your daughter,</i>

137
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:56,434
<i>and now you put</i>
<i>our lives in danger?</i>

138
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,339
<i>Bitch!</i>
- I did not abandon her.

139
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,708
You have no clue
what happened to me.

140
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,743
You need to see me
so I can give you

141
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,879
enough money for you
to disappear tonight.

142
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:10,915
You have to start a new life
where no one can find you,

143
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,583
or else you're dead,

144
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,685
and Maisey's doomed
to a life of misery.

145
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,821
<i>Calm down so we</i>
<i>can talk about this.</i>

146
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:18,990
<i>You are not making any sense.</i>

147
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,658
- <i> But, Everly...</i>
- Meet me at the park,

148
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,026
and call me when you're there.

149
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,788
- I love you.
- <i> Please tell me what...</i>

150
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,333
<i>Taiko, what the fuck?</i>

151
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:31,602
<i>It's been raining</i>
<i>fucking bullets in here</i>

152
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,438
<i>for the last 10 minutes.</i>

153
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,674
Broke-ass
motherfucker.

154
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,109
Listen, I've got a dead john

155
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,244
<i>bleeding all over my place</i>

156
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:42,113
<i>because of that</i>
<i>raggedy-ass bottom bitch.</i>

157
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:45,016
What the fuck is
going on over there?

158
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:48,853
Oh, you know I can
fuck her shit right up.

159
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,688
How much we talking?

160
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,722
Damn.

161
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,364
That's all you had to say.

162
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,300
<i>Hello, boys.</i>

163
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,238
Time to get motherfucking paid.

164
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,739
You, stay.

165
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,609
Zelda.

166
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,449
You shot your wad, bitch.

167
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,984
What?

168
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,165
Die, bitch.

169
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,914
Die, motherfucker.

170
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:42,233
I'm going to fuck you up.

171
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,339
Fucking sai?

172
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,640
<i>You bitch.</i>

173
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:52,043
Come here. You want
to fuck with me?

174
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:54,812
You fucked up, bitch.
I'm going to fuck you...

175
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,212
Hi.

176
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:29,680
Bye-bye.

177
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,355
Oh, thank...

178
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,390
<i>Shit.</i>

179
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,926
<i>Taiko is going to be pissed.</i>

180
00:17:41,928 --> 00:17:44,962
Wait.
Who did I just kill?

181
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,530
Everly.

182
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,532
- Nice try.
- Wait. Don't kill me.

183
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:49,967
Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.

184
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,136
I can double that price.
I have a lot of money.

185
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:55,239
Bullshit! You don't have any money
or even go out of this apartment.

186
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,907
He doesn't give you any money.

187
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,110
You think you're better
than us? Huh?

188
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,745
You're just his fucking slave.

189
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:01,812
- <i> Listen to me.</i>

190
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,281
I can prove it to you.

191
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:06,250
I have enough money
for both of us, okay?

192
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,319
Bullshit. He doesn't
give you any money, bitch.

193
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,554
You don't have...

194
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,723
Okay.

195
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:16,294
Shit.

196
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,631
- Fuck.
- That's what I said.

197
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:23,167
<i>Who the fuck did all this?
You do all this?</i>

198
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,336
Is he paying you for each one?

199
00:18:25,338 --> 00:18:26,504
Dena?

200
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:29,206
Everly?
You're not dead.

201
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,576
Sorry, sweetie,

202
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,345
but I need that fucking money.

203
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:36,747
Get the fuck out of here.
She's mine.

204
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,250
Elyse, you greedy bitch,
you have that money.

205
00:18:39,252 --> 00:18:40,584
<i>I don't need your fucking help.</i>

206
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:41,952
<i>She doesn't even have a gun.</i>

207
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,921
- I got here first!
- You fucked up.

208
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,823
- Fuck you. Fuck you.
- You fucked up. It's my turn.

209
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,491
- You fucking bitch.
- You fucked it up.

210
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:48,926
- What are you saying?
- Fuck you.

211
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,094
<i>Fuck you.</i>

212
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,996
<i>- Fuck...</i>
<i>- Fuck you.</i>

213
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,546
Oh, please. Oh, God.

214
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,948
<i>Oh, God, I don't want to die.</i>

215
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,616
<i>Please, help me.</i>

216
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,386
Everly.
Please, help me, Everly.

217
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:17,221
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

218
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,723
Not like this.

219
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,225
I'm scared.
I don't want to die.

220
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,187
Then shut up for once so you
can save your strength.

221
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,499
I understand
you want to kill me,

222
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,134
but do you want
to kill her, too?

223
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,670
Come on, help me.
Help me.

224
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:35,306
Please. I don't want to die.

225
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,708
Just put some pressure on here.

226
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,076
I'm scared.

227
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:41,412
- I don't want to go to hell.
- Okay.

228
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,314
Anna, you have to kill her.

229
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:44,682
I don't want to die alone.

230
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,083
I mean, I already
know she's going.

231
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:48,352
You're going
to be okay. Shh.

232
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,421
- What...
- Okay.

233
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,655
Shh.

234
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:52,990
Put some of this on.

235
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,525
- Okay.
- Okay.

236
00:19:56,062 --> 00:19:58,262
Dena.

237
00:19:59,097 --> 00:20:00,398
<i>Dena.</i>

238
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,671
I'm sorry.
I have to do this.

239
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,608
If I don't,
Taiko's going to kill me.

240
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,776
Anna...

241
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:14,745
look around you.

242
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:17,248
- I can kill you, too.
- No.

243
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,949
<i>We don't have</i>
<i>to do this right now.</i>

244
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,786
I know I'm
going to die tonight,

245
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,888
but I have a mother and a
five-year-old daughter,

246
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,856
and I have to do something

247
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,725
<i>to make sure they're</i>
<i>going to be okay.</i>

248
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,059
Why?

249
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,028
<i>You were a mother once.</i>

250
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,330
Stop. Stop. Don't talk.

251
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,034
Please help me save my child.

252
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,437
After that, I will
come back here,

253
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:42,206
and I promise it'll be you
who finishes this off.

254
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,909
How do I know
you're going to come back?

255
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,477
Because as long as I'm alive,

256
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,412
he will be obsessed
with hunting us.

257
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,714
But once I'm gone,

258
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:52,750
he'll forget
about them in time,

259
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,952
and they will be free.

260
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:57,922
I will make sure I die tonight,

261
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,559
but I don't want to give any
of them the satisfaction.

262
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:08,132
I want it to be you.

263
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,737
Okay.

264
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,175
I'm going to give you
two hours, Everly,

265
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,743
but don't fuck with me.

266
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,813
Because if you
can do all of this,

267
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:25,082
then I can do it, too.

268
00:21:27,652 --> 00:21:29,053
Good luck.

269
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:56,447
<i>That's a lot of dead whores.</i>

270
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,827
You don't get
to call them that.

271
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,062
Get up. Now.

272
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,430
Can't.

273
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:23,240
How bad is it?

274
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,210
It's pretty bad.

275
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,049
It's just a flesh wound.

276
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,751
It doesn't look fatal.

277
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:36,387
Can't say the same.

278
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:38,630
At least you
don't feel anything.

279
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,392
Can I ask you a favor?

280
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:45,496
Seriously?

281
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:48,265
I'm thirsty.

282
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,212
You're welcome.

283
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,796
Are you smiling?

284
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,133
Changed my mind.

285
00:23:39,618 --> 00:23:41,218
<i>We're too high up.</i>

286
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,554
Don't even think about it.

287
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:46,757
Best-case scenario,
the fall kills you.

288
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,759
<i>Worst case,</i>
<i>you break your legs,</i>

289
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,028
<i>and the dog eats you alive.</i>

290
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:55,099
Come here, Banzai.

291
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,134
I hate that dog.

292
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,572
Me, too.

293
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,748
You know guns,

294
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,283
and you're not a bad shot,

295
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,520
but you're not
going to make it.

296
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:24,094
Tell Taiko
he can lick my balls.

297
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:28,232
- Told you.
<i>- My turn, bitch!</i>

298
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,170
I'm nobody's bitch!

299
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:55,993
<i>No, please don't.</i>

300
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,494
- Finally.

301
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,196
Ralph.

302
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,531
Sorry.

303
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:18,849
Hello.

304
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,350
<i>Everly, where are you?</i>

305
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,553
<i>I thought you were</i>
<i>leaving 20 minutes ago.</i>

306
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:26,256
I was. Just had to wrap
some things up first.

307
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,991
<i>Of course.</i>
<i>Maisey's cold,</i>

308
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,993
<i>and I don't like it up here.</i>

309
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,929
I'll call you
when I'm on my way.

310
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:33,664
<i>Okay.</i>

311
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,572
Oh, shit.

312
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:51,181
Great.

313
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,553
<i>Police, ma'am.</i>

314
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,889
<i>Ma'am, the building's</i>
<i>not safe. Open up.</i>

315
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,758
<i>What's going on out there?</i>

316
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,960
<i>I'm all alone, and it's
the middle of the night.</i>

317
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:04,561
<i>- Get out of here.</i>
<i>- Please open up, ma'am.</i>

318
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,430
<i>We're evacuating the building.</i>

319
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:08,732
<i>Why don't you get rid of all
those whores around here?</i>

320
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,400
<i>It's like in the Bible,</i>

321
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,969
<i>you know, Sodom and Gomorrah.</i>

322
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:13,403
<i>You have to evacuate</i>
<i>the building, ma'am.</i>

323
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,038
<i>This way, please.</i>
<i>Follow me.</i>

324
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,273
<i>I'm not going anywhere</i>

325
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:17,741
<i>until my daughter gets here.</i>

326
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,143
That poor woman.

327
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:20,577
Her daughter's
been dead for two years.

328
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,880
<i>- Okay...</i>
<i>- Good night!</i>

329
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:34,091
<i>You have a video feed
of the building?</i>

330
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,893
Fancy.

331
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:38,962
You know how much
he likes to watch.

332
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:45,169
<i>I suppose it would be
too much to ask you</i>

333
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:48,572
to kill me instead
of have to face him.

334
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,307
<i>I didn't join in.</i>

335
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,775
I could have.

336
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,343
Oh, how generous of you.

337
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:56,280
Oh, wait.
Should I be offended?

338
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,322
I was just following orders.

339
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:01,985
And that absolves you
of any responsibility?

340
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,821
No, but some of these guys

341
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:04,988
actually enjoy this.

342
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,157
The rest of us
do it out of fear,

343
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,692
because if you don't,

344
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:10,160
Taiko will kill you

345
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,496
<i>or worse.</i>

346
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,364
Taiko has forced me

347
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,133
to do so many things so vile,

348
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,302
<i>human trafficking,</i>

349
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:20,103
sex slavery.

350
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,772
Gang rape.

351
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:23,040
Talk to God.

352
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,675
I'm not interested
in your confession.

353
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:26,176
<i>Wait.</i>

354
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:29,618
<i>Don't leave the video
for him to see.</i>

355
00:27:41,392 --> 00:27:42,893
Don't.

356
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,194
Trust me.

357
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:46,296
Destroy it.

358
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,261
<i>No!</i>

359
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:48,425
Look at me.

360
00:28:58,603 --> 00:29:01,805
<i>Sayonara,</i> Dead Man.

361
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,914
Come on.

362
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:46,016
<i>Come on.</i>

363
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:49,386
You can.

364
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:51,521
You can.

365
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,876
<i>Taiko says he'll be in touch.</i>

366
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,215
You have yourself
a merry Christmas.

367
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:20,984
<i>We've got her pinned down.</i>

368
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,954
That's a lot of dead whores.

369
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:26,023
Asshole!

370
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,228
<i>Callate, pendejo.</i>

371
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,912
I told you.
There's no way out.

372
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,715
What are you going to do?

373
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:55,385
Either you can help me

374
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,054
or shut the fuck up.

375
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:59,022
<i>May I suggest an idea?</i>

376
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:00,257
No.

377
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:02,826
<i>Something my grandfather</i>
<i>would say.</i>

378
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:04,494
I think I had my fill

379
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,830
of Buddhist proverbs
for the day, Dead Man.

380
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:09,866
A sanctuary sometimes resides

381
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,537
in the eye of the storm.

382
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:18,942
<i>Mom.</i>

383
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,011
I'm sorry. I cannot
get out of here,

384
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:22,846
so you're going
to have to come to me.

385
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,448
You need to get rid
of your car.

386
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,849
It's probably being tracked.

387
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:27,717
<i>What? No, no, no, no.</i>

388
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,753
<i>I am not giving up the car.</i>

389
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:32,456
Forget about your car.
Forget about your house.

390
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:35,459
You must come get
the money and vanish.

391
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:36,793
<i>Isn't that dangerous?</i>

392
00:31:36,795 --> 00:31:38,028
Well, of course
it's dangerous here,

393
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,930
but it's dangerous everywhere.

394
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:41,731
- <i> I don't know.</i>
- Listen. Listen.

395
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,700
I have a plan.
Come over here.

396
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,535
When you're getting
closer, call me,

397
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:47,804
<i>and then I'll explain to
you exactly what to do.</i>

398
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:49,306
<i>Where are you?</i>

399
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:50,740
157 Hopper Avenue.

400
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,975
<i>I am afraid.</i>

401
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:53,276
I'm scared, too.

402
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:55,212
<i>I'll call you when I'm there.</i>

403
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,981
<i>So...</i>

404
00:31:57,983 --> 00:32:00,450
we are having company.

405
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,986
You may want to clean up.

406
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,426
Shit.

407
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:13,717
Do you think Maisey
would like this dress?

408
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,188
What?

409
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,790
I think maybe you
should wear something

410
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,727
<i>a bit more practical,</i>

411
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,528
just in case.

412
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:31,501
Yeah.

413
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,207
Better?

414
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:38,942
<i>Yes.</i>

415
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:40,543
Much better.

416
00:34:43,814 --> 00:34:46,216
Now, what am I
going to do with you?

417
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,557
Could I ask you
for a last favor?

418
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,393
Why not?

419
00:34:56,395 --> 00:34:59,362
Can you light me a cigarette?

420
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:18,081
You know,
smoking will kill you.

421
00:35:25,856 --> 00:35:28,191
<i>Arigato.</i>

422
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:33,797
One thing I don't understand,

423
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:37,600
how were you able to
get to the police?

424
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:40,036
They got to me.

425
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:42,138
One day, my toilet broke,

426
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,473
and a plumber showed up

427
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,874
that was not really a plumber.

428
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:47,877
He promised
to get me out of here

429
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,713
and into the Witness
Protection Program

430
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:51,548
if I helped him.

431
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,784
Weren't you afraid
that he would find out?

432
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,988
Every minute of it,

433
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,690
but I kept thinking,

434
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:03,293
if they get the motherfucker,

435
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:04,961
I can go back to my family.

436
00:36:11,535 --> 00:36:12,969
Are you guys here?

437
00:36:12,971 --> 00:36:15,004
<i>We are walking</i>
<i>into the lobby now.</i>

438
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,906
Tell them that you're
coming to see your mother,

439
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,541
- Mrs. Haberdash...
- <i> Haberdash?</i>

440
00:36:18,543 --> 00:36:20,243
That she's been
complaining about

441
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:22,545
somebody trying to get her
out of her apartment, 7E.

442
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:23,880
<i>Get off on the seventh.</i>

443
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,915
<i>Take the stairs to the sixth.</i>

444
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:27,484
I'm at the end of the hall.

445
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:29,727
- I'll be waiting for you.
- <i> Seventh floor. Okay.</i>

446
00:36:31,056 --> 00:36:33,297
Are you ready
to meet the family?

447
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,859
Are you?

448
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:37,093
N...

449
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:39,996
<i>This way, Maisey.</i>
<i>Stay with me.</i>

450
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:42,165
Mom, say something.

451
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,067
<i>Can I help you, ma'am?</i>
- Say something.

452
00:36:44,069 --> 00:36:45,902
<i>Yes, we are coming</i>
<i>to visit my mother.</i>

453
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:48,071
<i>Sorry, ma'am. We had
an incident earlier.</i>

454
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,672
<i>Who exactly</i>
<i>are you going to see?</i>

455
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,541
<i>Um, Mrs., um...</i>

456
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,942
Haberdash.
Haberdash.

457
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,445
- <i> ...Haberdash. 7E.</i>
- Yes.

458
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:57,714
<i>She's just calling me about
these strange people</i>

459
00:36:57,716 --> 00:37:00,683
<i>trying to kick her out</i>
<i>of her apartment.</i>

460
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,419
<i>This used to be</i>
<i>a very nice neighborhood.</i>

461
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:04,020
<i>Right,</i>
<i>Mrs. Haberdash.</i>

462
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:05,422
<i>Lovely lady.</i>

463
00:37:05,424 --> 00:37:06,756
<i>Tell her sorry for the noise.</i>

464
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,391
<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>we had an incident.</i>

465
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,126
<i>- It should all be over soon.
- Thank you.</i>

466
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:11,694
<i>Come, Maisey.</i>

467
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:14,464
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>Come, come, come.</i>

468
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,904
<i>We are in the elevator.</i>

469
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,806
<i>Be right up.</i>

470
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:24,607
<i>Six.</i>

471
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:25,909
- Seventh!
- <i> What, Mom?</i>

472
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,777
<i>- Siete.</i>
<i>- Oh, no, seven.</i>

473
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,312
<i>My mistake.</i>

474
00:37:29,314 --> 00:37:31,614
<i>Seven.</i>

475
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:33,116
<i>You're doing good, Mom.</i>

476
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,218
<i>Thank you.</i>

477
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:08,378
Hi, Mom.

478
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:10,880
Hey.

479
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:13,716
I'm...

480
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:16,819
Everly.

481
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:21,190
You were such a little
girl last time I saw you.

482
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,561
Can we continue this
inside, please?

483
00:39:24,563 --> 00:39:25,728
No, Mom.

484
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,930
There is no time.

485
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:29,032
You have to take
the money and go.

486
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,600
I'm sorry.

487
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:37,273
Seriously, you have to go.

488
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:40,743
Cartoons.

489
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:42,278
Hush. Not right now.

490
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,147
<i>Aw, but, Grandma...</i>

491
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,517
Hello.

492
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,285
<i>Hajimemashite.</i>

493
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:51,554
Who is this?

494
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,089
This is...

495
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:54,251
a long story.

496
00:39:57,861 --> 00:39:59,462
Maisey.

497
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,800
<i>You don't need</i>
<i>to be afraid of me.</i>

498
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:05,468
<i>You know what?</i>

499
00:40:07,237 --> 00:40:11,140
I think I have something
you might like.

500
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:19,148
It's a Christmas gift.

501
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:25,588
It's for a very special
little girl.

502
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,458
Would you like to see it?

503
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:34,228
I'm sorry. I didn't
have time to wrap it.

504
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:38,968
She's been waiting for you
for a very long time.

505
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:42,538
Would you like to hold her?

506
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,812
You like Pinky Bear, right?

507
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:50,847
Yeah.

508
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,115
What do you say?

509
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,117
Thank you.

510
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,486
You're welcome.

511
00:41:00,592 --> 00:41:02,025
She is very pretty,

512
00:41:02,027 --> 00:41:03,726
<i>like you.</i>

513
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:09,098
Well, I would love
for both of you to stay,

514
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,968
but I understand
you need to go.

515
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,037
If they ask you
about Mrs. Haberdash,

516
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,472
just tell them that you
need to put this in the car

517
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:19,375
and that you're
coming back to get her.

518
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:23,346
Maisey, I need to speak
with Everly in private.

519
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,548
Stay put right here.

520
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,784
Don't move.
Don't touch anything

521
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:29,652
<i>or anybody, okay?</i>

522
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,355
Mom, we really
cannot do this now.

523
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:36,325
I am not going
to ask you twice.

524
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,561
Where is the bathroom, please?

525
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,563
What?

526
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:43,566
Keep an eye on her.

527
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:45,902
<i>Hai.</i>

528
00:41:45,904 --> 00:41:47,270
Hi.

529
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,506
Hi.

530
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:33,116
<i>No, Mama.</i>

531
00:43:24,434 --> 00:43:26,969
I don't know
where to begin, Mama.

532
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,309
There's so many things
I'd like to say to you.

533
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:37,246
But I can't.

534
00:43:41,485 --> 00:43:44,120
There's just no time.

535
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:45,688
I can tell you this.

536
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,191
I was taken against my will

537
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:50,259
<i>to be someone's slave.</i>

538
00:43:50,261 --> 00:43:53,896
I've been locked up in this
apartment for four years.

539
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:55,998
<i>I-I don't know</i>

540
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,920
<i>if you understand that.</i>

541
00:44:10,013 --> 00:44:11,814
What are you doing here?

542
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,617
Just visiting.

543
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,457
What's that?

544
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,861
Don't go over there.

545
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:26,796
Why not?

546
00:44:26,798 --> 00:44:29,732
Because I need your help
with something.

547
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:30,867
What?

548
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:33,669
I wanted to sing
a song for you,

549
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,339
but I forgot the words.

550
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:37,807
What song?

551
00:44:37,809 --> 00:44:39,342
<i>"Itsy Bitsy Spider."</i>

552
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,576
I know it.

553
00:44:40,578 --> 00:44:42,078
I know it.

554
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,717
Are you sick?

555
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:49,218
I am,

556
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,221
but singing always
makes me feel better.

557
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:06,435
You're funny.

558
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:07,904
Thank you.

559
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:10,840
I did not want you to
get involved in this.

560
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:13,075
I did everything I
could to protect you.

561
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:14,844
Who is this man?

562
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,747
He's the Devil.

563
00:45:17,749 --> 00:45:20,016
What did he do to you?

564
00:45:20,018 --> 00:45:21,617
Did he torture you?

565
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:24,086
No. I am luckier
than most girls

566
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:26,555
that get sent overseas
or stuck in a dungeon

567
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,258
<i>where they are</i>
<i>raped constantly.</i>

568
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,694
<i>They don't even last that long.</i>

569
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,964
For me, my worst torture

570
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:37,033
was losing my child.

571
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:38,534
<i>That's it.</i>

572
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:40,469
It's over. I am here,

573
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,872
and we are leaving
together right now.

574
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:43,973
Let's go.

575
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:45,374
Mama, this is not a telenovela.

576
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:48,044
Who do you think you are?
Forget about me.

577
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:50,212
I don't want you to be
a part of this world.

578
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:52,848
- - What's that now?

579
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,253
<i>That's who he is.</i>

580
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:58,421
<i>That's what he brings,</i>

581
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:02,158
<i>mierda, muerte.</i>

582
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,160
You must leave without me

583
00:46:04,162 --> 00:46:07,029
so you can protect Maisey.
Do you understand now?

584
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,581
Hey.

585
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:27,249
Where did you go?

586
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,289
Is this a Christmas present?

587
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:34,857
<i>Not exactly.</i>

588
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,826
Everly.

589
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:40,096
It's wet.

590
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:41,664
<i>Everly.</i>

591
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,767
Can I open it?

592
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:47,103
I don't think
that's a good idea.

593
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:48,170
Everly.

594
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:49,972
What do you think it is?

595
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,675
I couldn't even imagine.

596
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,212
Come on.

597
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,815
You are not leaving here alive,

598
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,984
are you?

599
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:03,686
Sorry, Mommy.

600
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:05,121
<i>Everly.</i>

601
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:07,990
<i>No!</i>

602
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,458
No!

603
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,027
Stop. Stop.
Don't touch.

604
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:13,190
Don't touch that.
I'm sorry, honey. No.

605
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:15,831
My sweet little...

606
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,700
are you hurt?

607
00:47:17,702 --> 00:47:18,801
Oh, my.

608
00:47:18,803 --> 00:47:19,969
I'm sorry.

609
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:22,972
I'm sorry I screamed
at you, honey.

610
00:47:22,974 --> 00:47:24,640
- You know, that gift...

611
00:47:24,642 --> 00:47:27,309
was not for little...

612
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:36,485
Okay.

613
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:40,456
<i>Sweetheart.</i>

614
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,423
Maisey.

615
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,792
Maisey!

616
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,569
<i>Oh, honey...</i>

617
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:27,837
<i>come...</i>

618
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,805
Banzai.

619
00:48:33,276 --> 00:48:34,510
Hey, Banzai.

620
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,713
Banzai...

621
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:40,049
kill!

622
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:55,164
Banzai, no!
Not him, her!

623
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:56,832
Banzai, kill that bitch!

624
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:58,634
- Banzai...

625
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:01,003
- ball!
- Oh, shit.

626
00:49:01,005 --> 00:49:04,173
Banzai, no!
That's not a ball!

627
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,784
Mom?

628
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,153
Mom?

629
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:18,521
<i>Everly.</i>

630
00:49:18,523 --> 00:49:20,689
It's okay.
You can come out.

631
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:27,429
Oh, that doggie
was scary, wasn't it?

632
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,999
I'm going to show you
a trick, Maisey.

633
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:32,434
When things get scary,

634
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:33,969
you close your eyes.

635
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,104
Close your eyes.

636
00:49:35,106 --> 00:49:38,607
You imagine snowflakes,

637
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:41,443
and you start counting the
little, tiny snowflakes.

638
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:42,678
One...

639
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,947
Why we are watching
television now?

640
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:48,184
<i>Two, three...</i>

641
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:49,518
Shit.

642
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,187
<i>Don't say that.</i>

643
00:49:51,189 --> 00:49:52,855
Sorry.

644
00:49:54,057 --> 00:49:55,157
- Shit.
- Let's go.

645
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,192
Seven,

646
00:49:56,194 --> 00:49:59,028
- eight...
- We can make it.

647
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,130
Nine,

648
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:03,365
- 10...
- Okay.

649
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:04,833
- <i> Stay there. Stay there.</i>
- ...11...

650
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,069
- Stay there. Stay there.
- ...12...

651
00:50:07,071 --> 00:50:09,572
Anna, open the door, please.

652
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:11,307
<i>Anna, my little girl is here.</i>

653
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:13,709
Can she watch cartoons
in your television?

654
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:15,311
10 minutes.
10 minutes.

655
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:16,312
16...

656
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:17,880
I just got to take care

657
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:19,982
of some business, but it's
coming up the elevator.

658
00:50:19,984 --> 00:50:21,684
And then I'll come back up,

659
00:50:21,686 --> 00:50:23,485
<i>okay, and I'll pay</i>
<i>my debt, but just</i>

660
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,988
let them in for 10 minutes.
Come on.

661
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,690
Both of them.
Come on.

662
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,725
Just keep them there
for five minutes,

663
00:50:29,727 --> 00:50:32,261
five minutes.
Come on, Anna.

664
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,598
Okay, for her.

665
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,865
- Get in.
- Come on. Come on.

666
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,167
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

667
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:39,435
Deal's not done.

668
00:50:39,437 --> 00:50:41,757
I understand.
I understand.

669
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:05,027
Holy shit.

670
00:51:29,152 --> 00:51:31,320
What the fuck now?

671
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:38,327
<i>Where are...</i>

672
00:54:16,986 --> 00:54:18,954
No.

673
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:20,422
No!

674
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:16,245
A make-up artist.

675
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,367
Sulfuric acid.

676
00:55:47,343 --> 00:55:48,644
Gasoline.

677
00:55:51,414 --> 00:55:53,515
<i>Oh, God.</i>

678
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,552
Battery acid.

679
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,392
Sodium hydroxide.

680
00:56:03,394 --> 00:56:05,827
<i>No, no.</i>

681
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:16,772
No, no.

682
00:56:16,774 --> 00:56:18,540
No. No.

683
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:21,577
What are you
going to do to me?!

684
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:29,084
<i>No, no, no!</i>

685
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:31,353
<i>Stay away from me!</i>

686
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,858
No. No.

687
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,628
- H2O.

688
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:47,135
<i>Quit with the noise!</i>

689
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,937
- <i> I'm coming down there.</i>

690
00:56:48,939 --> 00:56:50,979
<i>I'm going</i>
<i>to give you a what-for...</i>

691
00:56:57,146 --> 00:56:58,480
<i>You killed her.</i>

692
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:47,029
Please stop.

693
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:48,930
No.

694
00:57:51,467 --> 00:57:53,101
No. No.

695
00:57:53,103 --> 00:57:55,504
No.

696
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:10,852
No!

697
00:58:53,262 --> 00:58:57,099
Don't touch her. Don't
you fucking touch her!

698
00:58:57,101 --> 00:58:59,101
<i>Stop! No, don't!</i>

699
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:15,550
No.

700
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,852
No, no.

701
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:18,086
No.

702
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:23,692
<i>Stop!</i>

703
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:27,262
If she dies, you die slower.

704
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,603
No.

705
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,940
<i>Mom, don't swallow it!</i>

706
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:45,280
No. No.

707
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:14,442
Come on, Mama. Mama.

708
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,944
Wake up. Look...

709
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,879
Mom, come on.

710
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,249
You have to throw up.

711
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:24,519
Come on, Mom,
please. Throw up.

712
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:33,929
Come on!

713
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:38,366
That's okay. That's okay.

714
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:39,768
It's okay.

715
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,770
- It's okay.

716
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:43,705
It's okay. It's okay.

717
01:01:20,377 --> 01:01:23,111
<i>Kanpai, puto.</i>

718
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:26,942
It's okay, Mama.

719
01:02:29,312 --> 01:02:32,113
It'll be all right.

720
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:34,349
It's going to be all right.

721
01:03:04,146 --> 01:03:07,115
What more do you want,
you son of a bitch?

722
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:08,483
Haven't you had enough?

723
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:11,920
<i>With a show like this, never.</i>

724
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:16,925
<i>By the way, how's your mother?</i>

725
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,761
<i>These past few hours,</i>

726
01:03:19,763 --> 01:03:23,331
<i>it's been extraordinary,</i>

727
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,100
<i>but now it's time</i>

728
01:03:25,102 --> 01:03:28,470
<i>to watch you truly suffer.</i>

729
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:30,872
<i>Your mother has fought</i>
<i>the good fight.</i>

730
01:03:30,874 --> 01:03:35,176
<i>Now it's time for you</i>
<i>to say good-bye.</i>

731
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:09,477
<i>Everly.</i>

732
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:15,050
<i>Pick up the phone, Everly.</i>

733
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,955
<i>I'm not done with you yet.</i>

734
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:39,240
<i>I wouldn't do that.</i>

735
01:04:39,242 --> 01:04:40,475
Fuck you.

736
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:25,019
Everly!

737
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,891
Everly!

738
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:40,068
Everly!

739
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:14,455
Happy holidays, Everly.

740
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,655
And so it ends,

741
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:56,758
not with a bang,

742
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,793
but a whimper.

743
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:04,098
You are nothing.

744
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:08,002
You don't exist.

745
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:12,240
This is all a nightmare.

746
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:15,877
If I die,

747
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:18,813
it'll be like waking up.

748
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:22,283
And if I don't...

749
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:26,788
it'll be your nightmare,
motherfucker.

750
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,768
You have been a revelation.

751
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:43,738
<i>But don't kid yourself.</i>

752
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:46,641
You have only gotten so far

753
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:48,109
because I allowed you to.

754
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:49,610
If you're going to do it,

755
01:10:49,612 --> 01:10:51,345
just do it, and shut up.

756
01:10:55,284 --> 01:10:57,385
After all you've
been through tonight,

757
01:10:57,387 --> 01:10:59,987
<i>did you really think</i>

758
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:02,557
I would make it that easy?

759
01:11:09,064 --> 01:11:10,164
Yeah.

760
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:13,801
<i>Why haven't you killed me?</i>

761
01:11:13,803 --> 01:11:16,604
Maybe you can't bear

762
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:19,140
the thought
of living without me.

763
01:11:20,008 --> 01:11:22,210
Maybe no matter what I do...

764
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:27,682
you just don't want me gone.

765
01:11:27,684 --> 01:11:28,916
Hmm?

766
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,921
Maybe I go across the hall

767
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:35,423
and get your daughter,

768
01:11:35,425 --> 01:11:37,992
make her watch
the rest of this.

769
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:42,830
<i>Does little Maisey know</i>

770
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:46,801
that her mother is nothing
but a used, discarded whore?

771
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:49,504
Keep my daughter's name
out of your mouth!

772
01:11:55,211 --> 01:11:59,180
Your bastard child
should be honored

773
01:11:59,182 --> 01:12:01,616
that I even know its name,

774
01:12:01,618 --> 01:12:03,551
<i>that I let it live,</i>

775
01:12:03,553 --> 01:12:08,723
in spite of its
traitorous mother!

776
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:31,812
No!

777
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:52,099
Frankly, death by my sword

778
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:55,169
is an honor you don't deserve.

779
01:13:04,112 --> 01:13:06,213
I would take your heart,

780
01:13:06,215 --> 01:13:08,583
but your betrayal has shown me

781
01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:10,785
that you don't have one.

782
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:12,086
You stole my life.

783
01:13:12,088 --> 01:13:14,789
I owe you no loyalty.

784
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:17,124
I fucking hate you!

785
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:23,097
I loved you.

786
01:13:23,099 --> 01:13:25,333
Tough shit.

787
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:32,473
It's infinitely more painful

788
01:13:32,475 --> 01:13:34,075
to remove a tattoo

789
01:13:34,077 --> 01:13:36,010
than it is to receive one.

790
01:13:36,945 --> 01:13:39,880
And the same is true for love.

791
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:45,886
You don't have
to go through the pain

792
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:48,823
of removing your love for me...

793
01:13:48,825 --> 01:13:52,627
so I will take back my tattoo

794
01:13:52,629 --> 01:13:54,462
as a souvenir.

795
01:13:57,834 --> 01:13:59,967
You branded me like a cow.

796
01:13:59,969 --> 01:14:02,069
Take it.

797
01:14:18,286 --> 01:14:19,787
<i>Turn over.</i>

798
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:22,089
I want to look at your eyes

799
01:14:22,091 --> 01:14:24,859
when I kill you.

800
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:05,533
<i>If I die by your hand,</i>

801
01:15:05,535 --> 01:15:08,035
you and Maisey

802
01:15:08,037 --> 01:15:09,870
will never be safe.

803
01:15:18,648 --> 01:15:20,614
<i>Then die with honor.</i>

804
01:15:21,383 --> 01:15:24,118
Do it yourself.

805
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:41,168
What happened

806
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:43,270
to honor in love?

807
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:49,643
You'll never
know love like I do.

808
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:23,938
<i>What are you doing</i>
<i>with Pinky Bear?</i>

809
01:17:29,512 --> 01:17:31,779
Take Pinky Bear.

810
01:17:31,781 --> 01:17:33,447
Take Pinky Bear,

811
01:17:33,449 --> 01:17:35,783
and she'll protect you.

812
01:17:35,785 --> 01:17:38,485
Okay? Yeah?

813
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,321
And promise she's going
to stay with you

814
01:17:40,323 --> 01:17:41,889
and you won't lose her?

815
01:17:41,891 --> 01:17:44,291
Promise me.

816
01:17:44,293 --> 01:17:47,228
Okay. Now, I'm going
to be right back.

817
01:17:47,230 --> 01:17:48,863
Don't move.

818
01:17:54,737 --> 01:17:56,136
<i>Hello.</i>

819
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:57,738
<i>911.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

820
01:17:57,740 --> 01:18:00,140
<i>911? Yes, I need help.</i>
<i>There's a little girl...</i>

821
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:02,543
<i>Ma'am, I'm going to need</i>
<i>you to calm down.</i>

822
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:04,678
<i>- Who is it?
- Can you tell me where you are?</i>

823
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,081
<i>Ma'am, please. Hello?</i>

824
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:09,750
<i>- Go away!</i>
<i>- Ma'am, are you there?</i>

825
01:18:11,254 --> 01:18:13,187
<i>If you're talking,</i>
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

826
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:14,555
<i>- No, get out!</i>

827
01:18:14,557 --> 01:18:15,890
<i>Get out!</i>

828
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:21,195
<i>All units, all units,</i>

829
01:18:21,197 --> 01:18:22,763
<i>please be advised,</i>

830
01:18:22,765 --> 01:18:24,531
<i>A.D.W. in progress,</i>

831
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,334
<i>157 Hopper Avenue.</i>

832
01:18:27,336 --> 01:18:29,336
<i>Respond code three.</i>

833
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:33,440
<i>Ma'am, are you there?</i>

834
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:34,942
<i>Grandma?</i>

835
01:18:34,944 --> 01:18:36,543
<i>Ma'am, keep talking.</i>

836
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,779
<i>I'm not hearing you.</i>
<i>Are you there?</i>

837
01:18:42,550 --> 01:18:44,485
<i>Ma'am, can you hear me?</i>

838
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:48,188
<i>Hello, ma'am?</i>

839
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:53,928
<i>Ma'am?</i>

840
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:55,696
<i>Ma'am, are you there?</i>

841
01:19:03,438 --> 01:19:04,805
Grandma!

842
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:12,446
<i>Grandma!</i>

843
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:35,135
If you're feeling scared,

844
01:19:35,137 --> 01:19:37,338
you close your eyes

845
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,440
and count snowflakes.

846
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:42,910
One, two...

847
01:19:42,912 --> 01:19:45,679
- It's okay, little girl.
- ...three, four,

848
01:19:45,681 --> 01:19:48,615
- <i> five, six...</i>
- Open your eyes.

849
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:51,418
- ...seven, eight...
- Turn around.

850
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:54,455
Nine, 10...

851
01:19:54,457 --> 01:19:56,523
Turn around!

852
01:20:05,166 --> 01:20:08,168
<i>Maisey...</i>

853
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:09,937
you're safe.

854
01:20:12,675 --> 01:20:14,441
Maisey.

855
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:18,245
Come here, honey.

856
01:20:19,681 --> 01:20:22,449
I know I might look scary,

857
01:20:22,451 --> 01:20:25,786
but I would never
do anything to hurt you.

858
01:20:25,788 --> 01:20:27,554
Come sit with me.

859
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:31,525
It's over.

860
01:20:44,305 --> 01:20:46,874
I know who you are.

861
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:52,312
You do?

862
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:53,914
You're my mommy.

863
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:56,884
I have your picture in my room.

864
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:05,259
That makes me very happy.

865
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:08,262
You know what?

866
01:21:09,431 --> 01:21:13,300
I've always had
your picture with me, too.

867
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:21,175
And now I want you
to have it, okay?

868
01:21:23,745 --> 01:21:26,513
I want you to keep it

869
01:21:26,515 --> 01:21:28,515
and think about me,

870
01:21:28,517 --> 01:21:31,018
my little girl.

871
01:21:34,722 --> 01:21:37,458
Why were you gone
so long, Mommy?

872
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:39,159
I miss you.

873
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:46,200
I miss you so, so much too.

874
01:21:46,202 --> 01:21:48,202
<i>And...</i>

875
01:21:49,270 --> 01:21:52,406
not one minute went by

876
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:55,042
where I didn't think about you.

877
01:21:56,545 --> 01:21:59,546
I had a hole
in my heart right here

878
01:21:59,548 --> 01:22:02,516
every second we were apart.

879
01:22:05,386 --> 01:22:08,822
But today, when I saw you...

880
01:22:09,624 --> 01:22:12,659
ah, Maisey,

881
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:15,896
you filled my broken heart.

882
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:24,371
I love you, always.

883
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:29,042
Always and forever?

884
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:32,679
Forever and ever.

885
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:35,849
I-I love you, Mommy.

886
01:22:50,598 --> 01:22:52,232
Mommy?

887
01:23:08,349 --> 01:23:10,184
Medics! Come!

888
01:25:23,319 --> 01:25:24,785
I'll take it.

889
01:25:24,787 --> 01:25:26,119
I'll count the bag.

890
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,088
Come on.
Hurry up. Here.
