1
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:25,442
The year 2078.
A mining colony on planet Sirius 6B.

2
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:30,655


3
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,741
For 50 years, the New Economic
Block, the NEB Corporation, -

4
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:37,954
- has controlled mining
throughout the known solar systems.

5
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:42,125
20 years ago, on Sirius 6B, -

6
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:45,253
- the NEB discovered the solution
to the energy crisis. Berynium.

7
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:49,424
But mining berynium unleashed lethal
doses of radiation and pollution.

8
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:54,638
''The Alliance'', a federation
of mine workers and scientists, -

9
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:58,808
- demanded mining be stopped.

10
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:01,937
The NEB 's reponse
was to declare all-out war.

11
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:06,107
This conflict has fuelled
a new cold war on Earth, -

12
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:10,278
- but so far the fighting
has been confined to Sirius 6B.

13
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:14,449


14
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:15,492
Massive NEB bombing raids have
devastated this beautiful planet.

15
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,791
Thousands have been killed
by deadly berynium radiation.

16
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:26,961
Now, in the tenth year of the war,
the survivors on Sirius 6B -

17
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:32,175
- are faced with a new threat
beyond imagination . . .

18
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:36,346


19
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,051
- Okay, ante up.
- Five.

20
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:25,264
Okay, l see your five.

21
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:29,435


22
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,691
- Back in the slammer.
- Those were my last smokes.

23
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:39,862
This game sucks.

24
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:44,033


25
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:48,204
This whole place sucks.

26
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:52,375


27
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,143
Lieutenant, l think you"d
better have a look at this.

28
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:14,272


29
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:35,126
What the hell is he doing here?

30
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:40,339
Tell the captain we"ve got
a situation. A NEB coming in.

31
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:45,553


32
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,681
- How did he get this far?
- l"m going to take him.

33
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,852


34
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:54,937
He"s mine.

35
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:57,023


36
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:14,749
- What are you waiting for?
- Something"s not right. He"s alone.

37
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:22,048


38
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:29,346
Here comes the cavalry.

39
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:32,475


40
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:45,464
No matter how many times
l see this, it still makes me sick.

41
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:50,678


42
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:59,019
l"m glad
those things are on our side.

43
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:04,233
Our side"s the good side, right?
Tell me again, it"s a little blurry.

44
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:11,532
We created them.
We didn"t have any choice.

45
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:15,703


46
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:16,745
Without the screamers
we"d have lost the war.

47
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:20,916
- ls the NEB still out there?
- Yeah, but not in one piece.

48
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:27,172
Just the one?
What the hell was he doing out here?

49
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:32,386


50
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:33,429
He had something in his hand
that he wanted to show us.

51
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,599


52
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,770
Well . . .
l guess l"d better take a look.

53
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,941
Are you going out there?

54
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:49,069


55
00:08:45,941 --> 00:08:50,112
That"s a great plan.
lt"s probably some kind of bomb.

56
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:54,283
Get off your butt
and open the goddamn door.

57
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:58,454


58
00:09:10,966 --> 00:09:15,137
Check your tabs, sir.

59
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:17,222


60
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:12,963
CRUClAL: TO ALLlANCE COM MANDER

61
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:18,176


62
00:11:47,372 --> 00:11:51,543
- Who wrote this shit?
- Mozart.

63
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:55,714


64
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:56,756
- ""Don Giovanni.""
- Don Giovanni?

65
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:59,885
What the hell do you want, Chuck?

66
00:11:58,842 --> 00:12:03,013
Tear your eye away from that coin,
and l"ll tell you.

67
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:08,226
lt"s the portrait of a sphinx.

68
00:12:07,183 --> 00:12:11,354
lt belonged to Augustus Caesar, the
first great emperor of the world.

69
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:16,568
Riddle me this, Caesar. We haven"t
seen a NEB soldier in six months.

70
00:12:16,568 --> 00:12:20,739


71
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:21,781
Why does one solitary grunt
get shredded by a screamer -

72
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:25,952
- trying to hand deliver this?

73
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:29,080


74
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:34,294
Priority seven. You and me . . . and
God, if he"s still paying attention.

75
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:38,465


76
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:39,507
l doubt it.

77
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:41,593


78
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:47,849
- ls it a trick?
- l couldn"t get into it, either.

79
00:12:47,849 --> 00:12:52,020
- Don"t do that!
- Scared you, didn"t l?

80
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:55,148


81
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:57,233
Jesus!

82
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,362


83
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,660
""From Marshall Richard Cooper,
Fifth NEB Army Command.""

84
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:11,831
""To Joseph Hendricksson.
Matters of extreme urgency.""

85
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:16,002
""Demand immediate
peace negotiation.""

86
00:13:16,002 --> 00:13:20,173
""Request two officers.
Safe passage guaranteed.""

87
00:13:21,216 --> 00:13:25,386
""We await your arrival ASAP.""

88
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:29,557


89
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:30,600
- Peace negotiation.
- They sound pretty desperate.

90
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,771
- We"ve been waiting for this.
- What have we been waiting for?

91
00:13:36,856 --> 00:13:41,027
The end of the war.

92
00:13:39,984 --> 00:13:44,155
Maybe it"s another bullshit tactic
to get us to lay back.

93
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,369
- MacDonald, are you there?
- Yes, sir.

94
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:52,497


95
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:56,668
l want the following message
transmitted to San Francisco.

96
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:01,881
Have received first contact
from NEB army in six months.

97
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:06,052


98
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:07,095
They wish to open peace
negotiations. Please advise.

99
00:14:07,095 --> 00:14:11,266


100
00:14:08,137 --> 00:14:12,308
We picked up an emergency message
from a commercial transport.

101
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:16,479


102
00:14:13,351 --> 00:14:17,522
We"re 5 million miles
off of the shipping lanes.

103
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:20,650
Find out what their emergency is.
No clearance, no landing.

104
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:26,906
Joe, what do you make of this?

105
00:14:26,906 --> 00:14:31,077


106
00:14:30,034 --> 00:14:34,205
Looks like a map
of the forward command post.

107
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:38,376
- They"re laying themselves open.
- So why the pony express?

108
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:42,547


109
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:43,589
They"ve been completely silent
for two weeks. Not even radio.

110
00:14:44,632 --> 00:14:48,803
But why just one guy?
Why not a patrol?

111
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:54,017


112
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:06,529
- Secretary Green is arriving.
- Thank you, MacDonald.

113
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:10,700


114
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:23,212
Joe, Chuck, l have some very
inspiring news for you all.

115
00:15:23,212 --> 00:15:27,383


116
00:15:24,255 --> 00:15:28,426
Alliance HQ has been keeping
it classified. Wrapped up tight.

117
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:32,597
The NEB Corporation has approached
us requesting an armistice.

118
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:37,810
We could actually end this war.

119
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:43,024
Reserves of berynium
have been found on Triton 4.

120
00:15:43,024 --> 00:15:47,195
After extensive testing,
there"s no sign of radioactivity.

121
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:54,494
We are on the verge of signing
a world peace agreement.

122
00:15:54,494 --> 00:15:58,664
We"d also renew contracts
with the NEB to mine on Triton 4.

123
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:04,921


124
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:05,963
These negotiations
are extremely delicate -

125
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:10,134
- and we can"t afford to do anything
that might upset the apple cart . . .

126
00:16:11,177 --> 00:16:15,348
- Sorry, sir.
- Fix it.

127
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:19,519


128
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:21,604
- There"s radiation interference.
- Give me the damn thing.

129
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:26,817


130
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:27,860
Morse code was better
than this virtual reality shit.

131
00:16:28,903 --> 00:16:33,074


132
00:16:29,946 --> 00:16:34,116
lt is imperative to make no contact
with NEB Command on Sirius 6B.

133
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:40,373
l"m sure you won"t do anything that
would jeopardise our chances now.

134
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:47,672


135
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:51,842
Peace, can you believe it?
The NEBs are businessmen.

136
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:57,056
Now they"re mining on Triton 4,
peace is in their interest.

137
00:16:57,056 --> 00:17:01,227
- Thank God for Green.
- He"s a good man.

138
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:04,355
He prevented a war on Earth.

139
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:07,483


140
00:17:04,355 --> 00:17:08,526
A war on Earth
might"ve done them some good.

141
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:11,654


142
00:17:08,526 --> 00:17:12,697
lf those assholes
rolled around in the mud.

143
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:15,825
- Which assholes?
- NEBs and us.

144
00:17:14,782 --> 00:17:18,953


145
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:19,995
- We were all NEBs once.
- Exactly.

146
00:17:18,953 --> 00:17:23,124


147
00:17:28,337 --> 00:17:32,508
l just want to go home.

148
00:17:31,465 --> 00:17:35,636


149
00:17:32,508 --> 00:17:36,679
What"s the first thing you"ll do?

150
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:39,807
l"ve got no plans for the future.

151
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:42,935
- You have a lot to look forward to.
- lncome tax.

152
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:47,106


153
00:17:46,063 --> 00:17:50,234
Are you going to look her up
when you get back?

154
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:55,448
- What for?
- You tell me.

155
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,661


156
00:17:57,533 --> 00:18:01,704
She couldn"t take it.
She"s married and moved on . . .

157
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:06,917
. . . and l"m still here.

158
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:10,045
Not for long.
Do you still think about her?

159
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:14,216
lt used to be every minute,
then once a day.

160
00:18:14,216 --> 00:18:18,387


161
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:19,430
About twice a year
l get a kick in the chest.

162
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,601
What did she look like?

163
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:25,686


164
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,729
All personnel. Radiation alert!
Please light your reds.

165
00:18:26,729 --> 00:18:30,900
l left mine in the office.
Have you got one?

166
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,070


167
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:36,113
He must have been a brave man . . .
that NEB soldier.

168
00:18:37,156 --> 00:18:41,327


169
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:49,668
Alert!
All personnel to their stations.

170
00:18:50,711 --> 00:18:54,882


171
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:27,206
- They"re not civilians.
- No, a troop transport. All ours.

172
00:19:27,206 --> 00:19:31,377
- How bad is it?
- No survivors.

173
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:34,505
- Then what the hell is that?
- Get me out of here, man!

174
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:39,718
We"re going to cut you out of here.
Just hang on.

175
00:19:39,718 --> 00:19:43,889


176
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:44,932
""Sirius 6B Transportation.""
We"ve got no transportation service!

177
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:51,188
- What the hell is that?
- You"ve got to look at this.

178
00:19:52,231 --> 00:19:56,402


179
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:59,530
- Look at this.
- And this. lt"s a bomb factory.

180
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:03,700
Holy shit!

181
00:20:02,658 --> 00:20:06,829
A nuclear reactor!

182
00:20:05,786 --> 00:20:09,957
- When did we last see one of these?
- What"s happening here?

183
00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:15,170


184
00:20:13,085 --> 00:20:17,256
Come on.

185
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,341


186
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:20,384
- Careful. Are you all right?
- Calm down. l"m all right.

187
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:25,597
- Get this man a tab.
- What the hell"s a tab?

188
00:20:25,597 --> 00:20:29,768
- This guy"s naked here.
- Hold on a second.

189
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:34,982
One second!

190
00:20:33,939 --> 00:20:38,110


191
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:07,306
l"m out of here.

192
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:10,434


193
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:40,672
DEPT. OF DEFENCE

194
00:21:38,587 --> 00:21:42,758


195
00:21:41,715 --> 00:21:45,886
REVlSED

196
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,971


197
00:21:59,441 --> 00:22:03,612
You wanted to see me, Commander?

198
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:07,783
Yeah.
At ease, we"re informal around here.

199
00:22:07,783 --> 00:22:11,953
That"ll be all, Rodgers.

200
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:15,082


201
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:18,210
- How are you doing?
- Good . . . there"s a scar on my arm.

202
00:22:19,252 --> 00:22:23,423
lf you go outside without a tab on,
you"ll lose your arm. Name?

203
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:28,637
Private Michael Jefferson.
Gunnery specialist on six levels.

204
00:22:28,637 --> 00:22:32,808


205
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,850
First class.

206
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:35,936


207
00:22:32,808 --> 00:22:36,978
Level six? You can shoot
the dots off a dice at 1 00 yards.

208
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:42,192
lf you can load it, l can shoot it.
lnstructors used to call me ""Ace"".

209
00:22:43,235 --> 00:22:47,405
- Everybody here calls me ""sir"".
- Yes, sir.

210
00:22:47,405 --> 00:22:51,576


211
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:56,790
- Sir, what are they?
- lt"s a sword. Take a look.

212
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:03,046


213
00:22:59,918 --> 00:23:04,089
Screamers were developed to
neutralize the war on the ground.

214
00:23:05,131 --> 00:23:09,302


215
00:23:06,174 --> 00:23:10,345
- How do you know it"s dead?
- l yanked its brain out.

216
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:15,559


217
00:23:13,473 --> 00:23:17,644
- That"ll take your finger off!
- You said it was dead.

218
00:23:17,644 --> 00:23:21,815


219
00:23:18,687 --> 00:23:22,857
lt still has
a mechanical surface reflex.

220
00:23:21,815 --> 00:23:25,986
They get shot up, but can still
swing a sword. Pretty smart.

221
00:23:25,986 --> 00:23:30,156


222
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:31,199
Maybe too smart.
lt seems to have modified itself.

223
00:23:32,242 --> 00:23:36,413
Where"s everybody else?
The guys who were with me?

224
00:23:36,413 --> 00:23:40,583
- How many men onboard?
- 38, including me.

225
00:23:41,626 --> 00:23:45,797
Now there"s one, including you.

226
00:23:44,754 --> 00:23:48,925


227
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:53,096
Those guys . . .

228
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:55,181


229
00:23:52,053 --> 00:23:56,224
l didn"t even know them.
l couldn"t even talk to them.

230
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:02,480
Jefferson . . . what in the hell
are you doing here?

231
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:08,737
There was a nuclear reactor aboard
programmed for weapons manufacture.

232
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:13,950


233
00:24:12,907 --> 00:24:17,078
- l wasn"t aware of that.
- You radioed you were civilian.

234
00:24:17,078 --> 00:24:21,249
- Where were you bound?
- Triton 4.

235
00:24:22,292 --> 00:24:26,463
Why were you carrying
a nuclear reactor and weapons?

236
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:30,633


237
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:31,676
To invade, attack
and extinguish the enemy.

238
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:34,804


239
00:24:31,676 --> 00:24:35,847
- What enemy?
- The NEBs.

240
00:24:34,804 --> 00:24:38,975
You were going to attack
the NEBs on Triton 4?

241
00:24:38,975 --> 00:24:43,146
Yes . . . but we"re just a task force.

242
00:24:44,189 --> 00:24:48,359
4,000 Alliance Army regulars are
on their way to Triton 4 right now.

243
00:24:51,488 --> 00:24:55,658
- Secretary Green informed us . . .
- Secretary Green?

244
00:24:55,658 --> 00:24:59,829
- That"s right.
- Secretary Green is gone.

245
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:04,000
He"s been gone
for almost two years.

246
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:10,256


247
00:25:07,128 --> 00:25:11,299
We got a V. R. communique
from him yesterday.

248
00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:15,470
Secretary Green was arrested and
eliminated by the Alliance command.

249
00:25:17,555 --> 00:25:21,726


250
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:23,811
Two years ago.

251
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:26,940


252
00:25:32,153 --> 00:25:36,324
Dismissed.

253
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:38,409


254
00:25:35,281 --> 00:25:39,452
- l enlisted to fight . . .
- Dismissed, Jefferson.

255
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:44,666


256
00:25:41,537 --> 00:25:45,708
- The NEBs have been running . . .
- Get out of here!

257
00:25:46,751 --> 00:25:50,922


258
00:25:58,221 --> 00:26:02,392
What in God"s name
are we doing, Chuck?

259
00:26:03,434 --> 00:26:07,605


260
00:26:04,477 --> 00:26:08,648
- We just saw Green.
- We saw bullshit!

261
00:26:10,733 --> 00:26:14,904
You know as well as l do that
they can send us anything they want.

262
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:21,160


263
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:22,203
- That kid doesn"t know policy.
- Get your head out of the lilacs.

264
00:26:23,246 --> 00:26:27,417


265
00:26:24,288 --> 00:26:28,459
Do you expect me to believe
that we"re being dumped?

266
00:26:28,459 --> 00:26:32,630
That our 20-year stand here has
turned into a galactic gold rush?

267
00:26:33,673 --> 00:26:37,844
They keep sending us provisions.

268
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:40,972
Will they let us die up here while
they carry on running the universe?

269
00:26:43,057 --> 00:26:47,228
- l don"t buy it.
- Wake up, man!

270
00:26:46,185 --> 00:26:50,356


271
00:26:47,228 --> 00:26:51,399
We are betrayed here, brother.
We are beached.

272
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:55,570
Green"s been shit-canned
and this whole place is a lie!

273
00:26:57,655 --> 00:27:01,826


274
00:26:58,698 --> 00:27:02,869
They just can"t
cut us off up here.

275
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:07,039
Families on Earth would raise hell.

276
00:27:05,997 --> 00:27:10,168
And they won"t take us back there.

277
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:13,296
lf we sound off about this, nobody"s
going to fight their war for them.

278
00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:18,509
They"re just going to let us
roll on and on up here.

279
00:27:19,552 --> 00:27:23,723
We ain"t ever getting off here.

280
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,851
Marshall Cooper and
his NEB Command knows it, too!

281
00:27:28,936 --> 00:27:33,107
He sent us a map.

282
00:27:31,022 --> 00:27:35,193
Your solitary NEB grunt
got his ass shot to stop this thing.

283
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:41,449


284
00:27:38,321 --> 00:27:42,491
They know it"s pointless now.

285
00:27:40,406 --> 00:27:44,577


286
00:27:41,449 --> 00:27:45,620
- Where are you going?
- l"m going to NEB Command.

287
00:27:47,705 --> 00:27:51,876
We"ll make our own peace right here.

288
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:55,004


289
00:27:57,089 --> 00:28:01,260
NEB said they wanted two men.

290
00:28:00,217 --> 00:28:04,388


291
00:28:03,346 --> 00:28:07,516
Somebody"s got to stay here in case
anyone else falls out of the sky.

292
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,730


293
00:28:09,602 --> 00:28:13,773
- l"ll take Johnny Gung-Ho.
- The kid?

294
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,901
l"m not risking any more of our men.

295
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:21,072


296
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:24,200
This is your tab.
lt won"t work for anybody but you.

297
00:28:25,242 --> 00:28:29,413


298
00:28:26,285 --> 00:28:30,456
That makes me feel a lot better.

299
00:28:28,371 --> 00:28:32,541


300
00:28:29,413 --> 00:28:33,584
Screamers only attack living things.
They read your pulse rate.

301
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:36,712
Your tab broadcasts
a false heartbeat, flat-lining you.

302
00:28:37,755 --> 00:28:41,926
ln theory they work perfectly,
but radioactivity corrodes them.

303
00:28:42,968 --> 00:28:47,139
- What then?
- We thank God you"re a good gunner.

304
00:28:46,097 --> 00:28:50,267


305
00:29:00,694 --> 00:29:04,865
l was remembering that day
up in Point Reyes.

306
00:29:03,823 --> 00:29:07,993
- That bartender . . .
- With the monkey.

307
00:29:09,036 --> 00:29:13,207
The beach. We sat drinking beer,
watching the humpbacks blowing.

308
00:29:15,292 --> 00:29:19,463
You watched the whales, Joe.
l was watching other things.

309
00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:25,719
We should go back there.
l"d like to see that again.

310
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:29,890


311
00:29:26,762 --> 00:29:30,933
What, girls volleyball?

312
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:35,104


313
00:29:36,146 --> 00:29:40,317
Hey, Joe . . .

314
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:43,445


315
00:29:40,317 --> 00:29:44,488
l"ll see you soon.

316
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:46,574


317
00:29:43,445 --> 00:29:47,616
On that day. Jefferson, are you
coming or are you breathing hard?

318
00:29:47,616 --> 00:29:51,787
Good luck.

319
00:29:50,744 --> 00:29:54,915


320
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:54,350
Cicero, this is Libby.
Radio check, over.

321
00:30:55,392 --> 00:30:59,563
Cicero reading you loud and clear.

322
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,691
Next transmission will be 33:00
and then every 4 hours after that.

323
00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:08,947
lf l miss one, don"t sweat it.
lf l miss two . . .

324
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:13,118
. . . move into the office,
change the music and carry on.

325
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:17,289
l'll take the office, but the
''Don Giovanni'' will have to go.

326
00:31:19,374 --> 00:31:23,545
Roger, copy.

327
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,631


328
00:31:52,741 --> 00:31:56,912
- The air is terrible out here.
- lt"s what"s in the air.

329
00:31:56,912 --> 00:32:01,083


330
00:31:57,955 --> 00:32:02,125
- What, radiation?
- This"ll neutralize it. Here.

331
00:32:04,211 --> 00:32:08,382
- lt"s an anti-radiation red.
- That"s what poisoned it?

332
00:32:09,424 --> 00:32:13,595
That used to be the most profitable,
wonderful enterprise in the galaxy.

333
00:32:16,723 --> 00:32:20,894
lt produced berynium. The answer
to the world"s energy question.

334
00:32:20,894 --> 00:32:25,065
A spoonful could take you from
Earth to Saturn in a day.

335
00:32:25,065 --> 00:32:29,236
Then those mines started
puking up tons of radiation.

336
00:32:29,236 --> 00:32:33,407
We thought we"d discovered gold . . .
but we discovered shit.

337
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:38,620
And you smoke this shit just to
neutralize the shit in your lungs.

338
00:32:41,748 --> 00:32:45,919


339
00:32:44,876 --> 00:32:49,047
- How do you know it"s working?
- lf you don"t die.

340
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:53,218


341
00:32:55,303 --> 00:32:59,474
- God! What happened here?
- Blasts.

342
00:32:58,432 --> 00:33:02,602


343
00:32:59,474 --> 00:33:03,645
- NEB bombers.
- They nuked the civilians?

344
00:33:02,602 --> 00:33:06,773
The civilians got in the way.
The bombs were aimed at us.

345
00:33:06,773 --> 00:33:10,944
You just don"t have a clue about
what brought you here, do you?

346
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:17,200
You"d fight for any son of a bitch
if he convinced you you were right.

347
00:33:18,243 --> 00:33:22,414
- Someone convinced you.
- Not someone, something.

348
00:33:23,457 --> 00:33:27,627
The Alliance was formed
to support you.

349
00:33:27,627 --> 00:33:31,798
You"re right, Jefferson. And it
divided my country and my world.

350
00:33:34,926 --> 00:33:39,097


351
00:33:35,969 --> 00:33:40,140
So as much as you"re dying
to get shot by some NEB soldier, -

352
00:33:41,183 --> 00:33:45,353
- we"re going to make peace
with these people, you and me.

353
00:33:45,353 --> 00:33:49,524
We"re going to rip you off
of that experience.

354
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:55,780


355
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:59,951
Look at this place.

356
00:33:57,866 --> 00:34:02,037


357
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:03,079
l came here 20 years ago
to mine berynium for the NEB.

358
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:09,336
We were all NEBs then.

359
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:12,464
The scientists found radiation
and shut down the mines.

360
00:34:13,507 --> 00:34:17,677
The NEB Corporation threatened them,
and there was a stand-off for years.

361
00:34:19,763 --> 00:34:23,934
They they started to rain everything
down on us.

362
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:28,104
Nuclear disc bombs, chain bombs,
bacteria crystals.

363
00:34:28,104 --> 00:34:32,275
Civilian survivors were evacuated.
We retreated to the bunker.

364
00:34:34,361 --> 00:34:38,531
- How did you fight back?
- We reinvented an early weapon.

365
00:34:39,574 --> 00:34:43,745


366
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:44,788
- The sword?
- The autonomous mobile sword.

367
00:34:43,745 --> 00:34:47,916


368
00:34:44,788 --> 00:34:48,959
The screamer.

369
00:34:46,873 --> 00:34:51,044


370
00:34:54,172 --> 00:34:58,343
Save it.

371
00:34:55,215 --> 00:34:59,386


372
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,471
They don"t eat rats, do they?

373
00:35:00,428 --> 00:35:04,599


374
00:35:01,471 --> 00:35:05,642
We"re not sure.
They"re scavengers and they learn.

375
00:35:05,642 --> 00:35:09,813
They use everything. Rotting meat
gives off methane gas for fuel.

376
00:35:11,898 --> 00:35:16,069
Maybe eyeball jelly
makes good blade wax.

377
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:19,197
Are they machines? Are they alive?
l don"t understand . . .

378
00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:23,368
l don"t have the answers, Jefferson.

379
00:35:23,368 --> 00:35:27,539
- But where are they coming from?
- Underground.

380
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:31,710
The first design was sent to us
from the Alliance on Earth.

381
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:35,880
lt"s all automated now.

382
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:39,008
No one"s been down there since they
pushed the first button and ran.

383
00:35:40,051 --> 00:35:44,222
- They make themselves now.
- And no one knows how?

384
00:35:46,307 --> 00:35:50,478
They"re down there breeding
like rabbits and no one knows?

385
00:35:51,521 --> 00:35:55,692
Am l speaking Swahili?
That"s exactly what l mean.

386
00:35:56,734 --> 00:36:00,905


387
00:35:57,777 --> 00:36:01,948
Hit the dirt!

388
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:05,076


389
00:36:08,204 --> 00:36:12,375
Come out of there!

390
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:16,546
Come out of there!

391
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:21,759
Come forward.

392
00:36:20,717 --> 00:36:24,888


393
00:36:26,973 --> 00:36:31,144
- Stop.
- Can l come with you?

394
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:34,272
My God . . .

395
00:36:32,187 --> 00:36:36,357


396
00:36:33,229 --> 00:36:37,400
- Cover me.
- Go.

397
00:36:36,357 --> 00:36:40,528


398
00:36:43,656 --> 00:36:47,827
Jefferson.

399
00:36:45,742 --> 00:36:49,913


400
00:37:03,468 --> 00:37:07,639
You all right? lt"s okay.

401
00:37:08,681 --> 00:37:12,852


402
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:22,236
What have you got there?

403
00:37:22,236 --> 00:37:26,407


404
00:37:23,279 --> 00:37:27,450
Let me see.

405
00:37:25,365 --> 00:37:29,535


406
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:30,578
That"s a good guy.
No, you keep him.

407
00:37:31,621 --> 00:37:35,792
That"s your friend.
Where do you live?

408
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:41,005
- ln there?
- Yes.

409
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:45,176
ln the ruins?

410
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:48,304


411
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:52,475
How many are you?
How many people?

412
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:56,646
- You"re alone? How do you survive?
- Food.

413
00:37:56,646 --> 00:38:00,817
- What kind of food?
- Different.

414
00:38:00,817 --> 00:38:04,987


415
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:06,030
How do you keep away
from the screamers?

416
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:10,201
- The blades underground that kill.
- l hide.

417
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:14,372
- Can l come with you?
- No, you stay here.

418
00:38:15,414 --> 00:38:19,585
Give me a macro-ration.
We"ll give you something to eat.

419
00:38:21,671 --> 00:38:25,842
We"ll come back for you.
ln two or three days we"ll find you.

420
00:38:26,884 --> 00:38:31,055


421
00:38:30,012 --> 00:38:34,183
Take this.
You tear this and eat it.

422
00:38:35,226 --> 00:38:39,397
- l want to come with you now.
- We"ll come back in two days.

423
00:38:42,525 --> 00:38:46,696
You take care of this guy, okay?

424
00:38:46,696 --> 00:38:50,867


425
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,251
We can"t just leave him here.
He"s a kid. He"ll never survive.

426
00:39:02,336 --> 00:39:06,507
- What am l saying?
- Can l come with you?

427
00:39:06,507 --> 00:39:10,678


428
00:39:25,276 --> 00:39:29,447
- What"s your name?
- David Edward Dearing.

429
00:39:31,532 --> 00:39:35,703


430
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:50,301
- Where"s your mum and dad?
- They died in the blasts.

431
00:39:51,344 --> 00:39:55,514
You"ve been alone here
for four years?

432
00:39:55,514 --> 00:39:59,685
Everything seems to be okay.
ls it safe to make a fire like this?

433
00:40:00,728 --> 00:40:04,899
We want to let them know
we"re coming.

434
00:40:03,856 --> 00:40:08,027
- Fire keeps the rats away.
- Rats?

435
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:13,240


436
00:40:10,112 --> 00:40:14,283
l had this friend,
he used to eat them. Rats.

437
00:40:15,326 --> 00:40:19,497
You"ll appreciate this . . .

438
00:40:17,411 --> 00:40:21,582


439
00:40:18,454 --> 00:40:22,625
You don"t just heat up the oil,
that makes them stick to the pan.

440
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:27,838
You get the pan hot, put the oil
in cold, then add your rats.

441
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:33,052
But don"t crowd the pan,
it sucks all the heat out.

442
00:40:33,052 --> 00:40:37,223
You keep flipping them,
or they burn.

443
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:40,351


444
00:40:37,223 --> 00:40:41,393
- My friend said . .
- Jefferson!

445
00:40:40,351 --> 00:40:44,522
You must be confusing me
with somebody who gives a shit.

446
00:40:45,564 --> 00:40:49,735
Give me that rock, boy.
Cicero, this is Libby calling.

447
00:40:52,863 --> 00:40:57,034
- Come in, Cicero.
- Libby, how is it out there?

448
00:40:57,034 --> 00:41:01,205
lt"s cold.
We"re at 1 4 degrees north latitude.

449
00:41:02,248 --> 00:41:06,418
We expect to reach
the NEB Command . . .

450
00:41:06,418 --> 00:41:10,589
. . . in about four hours. Hello . .?

451
00:41:09,547 --> 00:41:13,717
We've got a new arrival.
He came in yesterday.

452
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,931
Chuck, you"re breaking up.

453
00:41:17,888 --> 00:41:22,059
You"ll get your next transmission
at 00:00 hours.

454
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:26,230
- Libby, over.
- lt seems a little strange . . .

455
00:41:27,273 --> 00:41:31,443


456
00:41:38,742 --> 00:41:42,913
lf you"re gonna be a rock,
be a rock. Don"t be a bug.

457
00:41:44,999 --> 00:41:49,169
Don"t do that to me!
l nearly pissed my pants . . . sir.

458
00:41:49,169 --> 00:41:53,340


459
00:41:50,212 --> 00:41:54,383
Things ain"t what they used to be.

460
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,511


461
00:43:11,543 --> 00:43:15,714
Jefferson!

462
00:43:13,629 --> 00:43:17,799


463
00:43:31,355 --> 00:43:35,525
- Didn"t you hear it?
- No.

464
00:43:34,483 --> 00:43:38,654


465
00:43:45,953 --> 00:43:50,123
- Good God, man!
- Cool, huh?

466
00:43:49,081 --> 00:43:53,251
- Do you know how much they cost?
- Keep that on your wrist.

467
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:57,422
- Doesn"t it work if it"s nearby?
- lt stays on your arm!

468
00:43:57,422 --> 00:44:01,593
l"m already dragging one kid around.
Do l have to tie your shoes for you?

469
00:44:02,636 --> 00:44:06,807
Your tab was on
and it was going for you.

470
00:44:06,807 --> 00:44:10,977


471
00:44:09,935 --> 00:44:14,106
What is this?
l"ve never seen this.

472
00:44:14,106 --> 00:44:18,276


473
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:21,405
lt looks like an animal.

474
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:23,490


475
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:25,575
lt"s not an animal.
lt"s an upgrade.

476
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:29,746
- Maybe it"s a NEB one.
- Jefferson, relent.

477
00:44:31,832 --> 00:44:36,002
We"re getting out of here.
Take your bear with you.

478
00:44:36,002 --> 00:44:40,173
- Where are we going?
- A long way for you, kid.

479
00:44:40,173 --> 00:44:44,344


480
00:44:43,301 --> 00:44:47,472
You soap the socks the night before.

481
00:44:47,472 --> 00:44:51,643
The water dries out
but the soap stays in.

482
00:44:51,643 --> 00:44:55,814
- You"ve got soap against skin . . .
- Have you got a dimmer switch?

483
00:44:56,857 --> 00:45:01,027
lf you put a teddy bear
in a microwave, nothing will happen.

484
00:45:01,027 --> 00:45:05,198
- But a wet frog . . .
- Shut up.

485
00:45:05,198 --> 00:45:09,369


486
00:46:46,341 --> 00:46:50,512
Jefferson!

487
00:46:50,512 --> 00:46:54,682


488
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,811
Goddamn screamer!
lt wanted to kill us.

489
00:46:57,811 --> 00:47:01,981


490
00:46:58,853 --> 00:47:03,024
lt can see us and touch us.
l can"t tell what the signals say.

491
00:47:06,152 --> 00:47:10,323
lt can talk.

492
00:47:08,238 --> 00:47:12,408


493
00:47:28,049 --> 00:47:32,220
- He"s a fucking toaster.
- That"s right.

494
00:47:31,177 --> 00:47:35,348
Pinocchio"s not a real little boy.

495
00:47:35,348 --> 00:47:39,519
- Why didn"t it try to kill us?
- lt was tagging you.

496
00:47:40,562 --> 00:47:44,732
They"re smarter now. They get
into our bunkers. They tag along.

497
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:49,946
Who can resist a kid
with a hard luck story?

498
00:47:49,946 --> 00:47:54,117


499
00:47:50,989 --> 00:47:55,159
Once it gets inside, the killing
starts. But you knew that already.

500
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:59,330


501
00:47:56,202 --> 00:48:00,373
- You brought him in here.
- lt found us.

502
00:48:00,373 --> 00:48:04,544
What is your reason for being here?

503
00:48:03,501 --> 00:48:07,672
We were invited here
for a peace negotiation.

504
00:48:07,672 --> 00:48:11,843
Marshall Cooper sent this
from NEB headquarters.

505
00:48:13,928 --> 00:48:18,099


506
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:22,270
You want to negotiate . .?

507
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:26,441
We ain"t gonna do it here.

508
00:48:25,398 --> 00:48:29,569


509
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:33,740
- Are you taking them to the bunker?
- You got something better to do?

510
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:39,996


511
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,209
- Sir, do you trust these guys?
- No.

512
00:48:45,209 --> 00:48:49,380


513
00:50:16,968 --> 00:50:21,138
- What are you doing?
- Calling the office. Problem?

514
00:50:22,181 --> 00:50:26,352


515
00:50:24,267 --> 00:50:28,437
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.

516
00:50:27,395 --> 00:50:31,565


517
00:50:28,437 --> 00:50:32,608
- How is it out there?
- We"ve got a new kind of screamer.

518
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:39,907
- l can't hear you real well.
- lt"s a kid. A little boy.

519
00:50:39,907 --> 00:50:44,078
- Don"t let it into the bunker.
- l can't hear you.

520
00:50:46,163 --> 00:50:50,334
There's too much interference.

521
00:50:49,291 --> 00:50:53,462


522
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:12,231
That kid, he was like a person.

523
00:51:12,231 --> 00:51:16,402


524
00:51:13,274 --> 00:51:17,445
How did he know what to say?

525
00:51:16,402 --> 00:51:20,573
You think Santa
makes them his little elves?

526
00:51:20,573 --> 00:51:24,744
They"ve got more brains than you.

527
00:51:23,701 --> 00:51:27,872
Fighting won"t solve our problems.

528
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:31,000
One of those kids tagged my patrol.
We took him into our bunker.

529
00:51:34,128 --> 00:51:38,299
- Nobody got out.
- Except you.

530
00:51:38,299 --> 00:51:42,470


531
00:51:39,341 --> 00:51:43,512
- What"s that supposed to mean?
- You figure it out.

532
00:51:43,512 --> 00:51:47,683
You guys brought them here.

533
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,811
Only after the bombing started.

534
00:51:49,768 --> 00:51:53,939
But now they don"t care what uniform
is covering your ass.

535
00:51:54,982 --> 00:51:59,153


536
00:51:56,025 --> 00:52:00,196
- Neither do l.
- Slow down, soldier.

537
00:51:59,153 --> 00:52:03,324
- Neither do l.
- Slow down, soldier.

538
00:52:00,196 --> 00:52:04,366
Would you mind
taking that outside?

539
00:52:04,366 --> 00:52:08,537
Stray bullets
are bad for the inventory.

540
00:52:07,494 --> 00:52:11,665
lt"s worth a lot more
when it ain"t all shot to . . . shit.

541
00:52:13,751 --> 00:52:17,922
l"m letting you stay here out of
the kindness of my heart, Becker.

542
00:52:18,964 --> 00:52:23,135
So follow the ground rules.
First, no gunplay inside.

543
00:52:26,263 --> 00:52:30,434


544
00:52:27,306 --> 00:52:31,477
Second, this is my place,
and nobody touches anything.

545
00:52:33,562 --> 00:52:37,733
Real Scotch, not synthetic shit.

546
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:40,861


547
00:52:39,818 --> 00:52:43,989
No spitting.

548
00:52:42,947 --> 00:52:47,117
Spare a cigarette?

549
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:52,331


550
00:52:57,544 --> 00:53:01,715
Well, gentlemen . . .

551
00:53:00,673 --> 00:53:04,843
Live it up.

552
00:53:02,758 --> 00:53:06,929


553
00:53:23,612 --> 00:53:27,783
l haven"t had an American cigarette
in over a year.

554
00:53:28,826 --> 00:53:32,996
There"s plenty back at base,
but l forgot to bring them.

555
00:53:32,996 --> 00:53:37,167
- You got the last one.
- Very generous of you.

556
00:53:37,167 --> 00:53:41,338


557
00:53:43,424 --> 00:53:47,594
What is this place, a commissary?

558
00:53:46,552 --> 00:53:50,722
There hasn"t been a commissary here
in over two years.

559
00:53:52,808 --> 00:53:56,979
Not since those blades arrived.

560
00:53:55,936 --> 00:54:00,107
- Are you a freelancer?
- Right. Black market, Commander . . .

561
00:54:02,192 --> 00:54:06,363
Hendricksson, Joseph. San Francisco.

562
00:54:04,278 --> 00:54:08,448


563
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:09,491
Jessica Hanson, Pittsburgh.
How do you do?

564
00:54:08,448 --> 00:54:12,619
- lt"s early in the day for that.
- Yeah.

565
00:54:11,577 --> 00:54:15,747


566
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:16,790
l"m looking for Marshall Cooper,
Fifth NEB Army.

567
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:20,961
He"d be in the command bunker,
if there still is one.

568
00:54:20,961 --> 00:54:25,132


569
00:54:22,004 --> 00:54:26,175
What about
your communication satellites?

570
00:54:26,175 --> 00:54:30,345
lf they"re still working,
they"d be in there, too.

571
00:54:30,345 --> 00:54:34,516
What do you mean by that?

572
00:54:33,473 --> 00:54:37,644
You have no idea
of the hell you opened up.

573
00:54:36,602 --> 00:54:40,772
We opened up? Just tell me
where the command bunker is.

574
00:54:44,943 --> 00:54:49,114
You wouldn"t last ten yards
out there without me.

575
00:54:50,157 --> 00:54:54,328
- Have you seen it?
- l heard it.

576
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:59,541
- Hordes of them.
- What hordes?

577
00:54:59,541 --> 00:55:03,712
Davids. l heard them
screaming into the bunker above us.

578
00:55:04,755 --> 00:55:08,925
l heard the soldiers screaming.

579
00:55:07,883 --> 00:55:12,054
Then it got very quiet.

580
00:55:09,968 --> 00:55:14,139


581
00:55:13,096 --> 00:55:17,267
Nothing . . .
except the smell of death.

582
00:55:19,353 --> 00:55:23,523


583
00:55:22,481 --> 00:55:26,651
- Still want a guided tour?
- lf Cooper is alive, l"ll find him.

584
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:33,950


585
00:55:31,865 --> 00:55:36,036
l"ll take you to Command.
We"ll go underground.

586
00:55:36,036 --> 00:55:40,207


587
00:55:40,207 --> 00:55:44,378
- l want something in return.
- Speak.

588
00:55:43,335 --> 00:55:47,506
- l want off this ashtray.
- Where?

589
00:55:46,463 --> 00:55:50,634
Earth. How long do you think
l"m gonna last in here?

590
00:55:53,762 --> 00:55:57,933
Nobody leaves. The NEBs and
Alliance are fighting on Triton 4.

591
00:56:00,018 --> 00:56:04,189
They"ve hung everybody
on this planet out to dry.

592
00:56:05,232 --> 00:56:09,402


593
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:12,531
Good Lord, you"re beautiful.

594
00:56:12,531 --> 00:56:16,701


595
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:19,830
l can take you back
to the Alliance bunker.

596
00:56:20,872 --> 00:56:25,043
- Deal.
- Going somewhere, Jessica?

597
00:56:25,043 --> 00:56:29,214
She"s taking me to NEB Command
and l"m taking her to Alliance.

598
00:56:30,257 --> 00:56:34,427
Cosy.

599
00:56:34,427 --> 00:56:38,598
And then what?
Become a prisoner of war?

600
00:56:38,598 --> 00:56:42,769
You can relocate anywhere
if you can get off this globe.

601
00:56:43,812 --> 00:56:47,983
Or you can go straight to hell
for all l care.

602
00:56:47,983 --> 00:56:52,153


603
00:56:49,025 --> 00:56:53,196
You"re crazy.
You don"t know what"s down there.

604
00:56:53,196 --> 00:56:57,367
- Afraid of the dark, Ross?
- Get off my back.

605
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:02,581


606
00:57:06,751 --> 00:57:10,922
Look at this. lt"s one of ours.

607
00:57:10,922 --> 00:57:15,093
She"s got everything.
And l found something else.

608
00:57:15,093 --> 00:57:19,264


609
00:57:23,435 --> 00:57:27,605
- What is it?
- A plutonium rocket.

610
00:57:28,648 --> 00:57:32,819
Plutonium? Have l been
blowing smoke out of my ass?

611
00:57:33,862 --> 00:57:38,033
We"ve not used nukes in this war yet
and we"re not going to use them now.

612
00:57:40,118 --> 00:57:44,289
So leave it.

613
00:57:43,246 --> 00:57:47,417


614
00:58:03,058 --> 00:58:07,228
Okay, let"s get on the good foot.
Anybody that"s coming, come on.

615
00:58:08,271 --> 00:58:12,442
""When he"s best,
he"s little worse than a man.""

616
00:58:12,442 --> 00:58:16,613
""And when he"s worst,
he"s little better than a beast.""

617
00:58:17,655 --> 00:58:21,826
l never knew they put
Shakespeare in comic books.

618
00:58:21,826 --> 00:58:25,997
Ain"t it sharp enough yet?

619
00:58:25,997 --> 00:58:30,168


620
00:58:30,168 --> 00:58:34,339
lt"s never sharp enough.

621
00:58:33,296 --> 00:58:37,467


622
00:58:43,723 --> 00:58:47,894
l"m not sure if these tabs work,
but stay close to me and Jefferson.

623
00:58:51,022 --> 00:58:55,193
Let"s go.

624
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:58,321


625
00:59:20,218 --> 00:59:24,389
This leads to the maintenance tunnel
underneath the command bunker.

626
00:59:27,517 --> 00:59:31,688


627
00:59:33,773 --> 00:59:37,944
l ain"t going in there.

628
00:59:36,901 --> 00:59:41,072


629
01:00:35,293 --> 01:00:39,464
Don"t tell me a big guy like you
is scared of mice!

630
01:00:41,549 --> 01:00:45,720
- Has a rat got your tongue?
- Get off my back.

631
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,891


632
01:00:46,762 --> 01:00:50,933
ls that all you know how to say?
Explain your vocabulary, Ross.

633
01:00:51,976 --> 01:00:56,147
Knock it off!
Just get off my back!

634
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:01,360


635
01:01:29,513 --> 01:01:33,684
We"re almost there.

636
01:01:33,684 --> 01:01:37,855


637
01:01:59,752 --> 01:02:03,923
This is the command centre.
This is the ground level.

638
01:02:04,965 --> 01:02:09,136

01:03:13,784 --> 01:03:17,955
- What the hell is this?
- lt"s exactly what you think it is.

642
01:03:18,998 --> 01:03:23,169


643
01:03:22,126 --> 01:03:26,297
l knew it!

644
01:03:25,254 --> 01:03:29,425
We"re all gonna die!

645
01:03:28,382 --> 01:03:32,553


646
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:35,681
Jefferson, if that man moves,
or even farts, shoot him.

647
01:03:38,809 --> 01:03:42,980


648
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:47,151
Shut up.

649
01:03:45,065 --> 01:03:49,236


650
01:04:08,005 --> 01:04:12,176
lf Richard Cooper were alive,
he"d be here, wouldn"t he?

651
01:04:14,261 --> 01:04:18,432


652
01:04:23,645 --> 01:04:27,816
The ComSat stabilizers
are all frozen.

653
01:04:26,774 --> 01:04:30,944


654
01:04:28,859 --> 01:04:33,030

01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:05,354


660
01:07:00,052 --> 01:07:04,222

01:07:02,137 --> 01:07:06,308

01:07:12,564 --> 01:07:16,735


664
01:07:20,906 --> 01:07:25,076
Jefferson, get everybody
out of here now. Do it!

01:07:26,119 --> 01:07:30,290


666
01:07:27,162 --> 01:07:31,333

01:09:22,902 --> 01:09:27,073

01:09:36,458 --> 01:09:40,628
We"re not leaving

01:09:39,586 --> 01:09:43,756

01:10:13,995 --> 01:10:18,166

- Jefferson!

683
01:10:24,422 --> 01:10:28,593
Cute, Jefferson.

684
01:10:27,550 --> 01:10:31,721


685
01:10:48,404 --> 01:10:52,575

687
01:11:45,753 --> 01:11:49,924
- Thanks for waiting, Becker.
- Yeah, next time.

688
01:11:49,924 --> 01:11:54,095
There won"t be a next time.
That was stupid.

689
01:11:53,052 --> 01:11:57,223
- What was so important back there?
- What other type?

690
01:11:59,308 --> 01:12:03,479
David was a type 3.
The reptile was a type 1 .

691
01:12:04,522 --> 01:12:08,693
What"s the other type?

692
01:12:08,693 --> 01:12:12,864


693
01:12:17,034 --> 01:12:21,205

01:12:22,248 --> 01:12:26,419
lt"s a . . . type 2.

01:12:25,376 --> 01:12:29,547


697
01:12:26,419 --> 01:12:30,590
- Genius. You can count up to three.
- Get off my back!

698
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:34,760
- lt"s a wounded soldier.
- ""Help me. Help me.""

699
01:12:35,803 --> 01:12:39,974


700
01:12:36,846 --> 01:12:41,017
There were only a few reported.
We thought you"d discontinued them.

701
01:12:42,059 --> 01:12:46,230
- We"ve never seen them.
- What do they look like?

702
01:12:46,230 --> 01:12:50,401
- Who do they look like?
- Look in the mirror, Ross.

703
01:12:50,401 --> 01:12:54,572
l"m warning you . . .
just get off my back.

704
01:12:56,657 --> 01:13:00,828


705
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:01,871

over and over.

01:13:12,298 --> 01:13:16,469


710
01:13:26,896 --> 01:13:31,067
He"s one of them.
He"s a machine. Type 2.

711
01:13:34,195 --> 01:13:38,366
He kept repeating himself.
You heard him.

712
01:13:38,366 --> 01:13:42,536
And what about the scotch?
You saw, he didn"t take a sip.

713
01:13:42,536 --> 01:13:46,707


714
01:13:44,622 --> 01:13:48,793
That"s right, sir.
We offered, but he refused.

715
01:13:48,793 --> 01:13:52,963


716
01:13:57,134 --> 01:14:01,305
That"s blood.

717
01:14:00,262 --> 01:14:04,433


718
01:14:04,433 --> 01:14:08,604
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit? Take a look.

719
01:14:09,647 --> 01:14:13,818


720
01:14:10,689 --> 01:14:14,860
l see a human being who got
wasted for no reason at all.

721
01:14:16,946 --> 01:14:21,116


722
01:14:25,287 --> 01:14:29,458
- What are you looking at?
- That wasn"t very human of you.

723
01:14:31,544 --> 01:14:35,714


724
01:14:35,714 --> 01:14:39,885
Until two days ago,
l didn"t even know you existed.

725
01:14:38,843 --> 01:14:43,013


726
01:14:39,885 --> 01:14:44,056
You think l"m one of them?

727
01:14:43,013 --> 01:14:47,184
Then you"d better kill me, too.

728
01:14:48,227 --> 01:14:52,398
See if l"ve got any switches inside.
Come on, be on the safe side.

729
01:14:55,526 --> 01:14:59,697


730
01:14:59,697 --> 01:15:03,867
Do it!

731
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:08,038


732
01:15:04,910 --> 01:15:09,081
Man, l"m out of here.
Anybody that"s coming, come on.

733
01:15:10,124 --> 01:15:14,295


734
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:32,021
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.

735
01:15:33,063 --> 01:15:37,234
Cicero, this is Libby. Come in.

736
01:15:37,234 --> 01:15:41,405


737
01:15:40,362 --> 01:15:44,533
lf you get killed,
will your man let us in?

738
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:47,661


739
01:15:44,533 --> 01:15:48,704
Not if he"s smart.

740
01:15:46,618 --> 01:15:50,789


741
01:16:08,515 --> 01:16:12,686
Do you want me to say l"m sorry?
Well, l"m not.

742
01:16:11,643 --> 01:16:15,814


743
01:16:13,729 --> 01:16:17,900
lt was a mistake.

744
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:22,070
l"ll kill you
before l let you make another one.

745
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:26,241


746
01:16:58,565 --> 01:17:02,736
Just got out of basic training,
didn"t you?

747
01:17:01,693 --> 01:17:05,864


748
01:17:03,779 --> 01:17:07,950
lt"s pretty obvious you"re a rookie.

749
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:12,120
You think you"re the centre
of the universe, but you"re not.

750
01:17:13,163 --> 01:17:17,334
We"re just insignificant
little specks, you and me.

751
01:17:17,334 --> 01:17:21,505


752
01:17:18,377 --> 01:17:22,547
We"re not gonna change the world.

753
01:17:22,547 --> 01:17:26,718
We"re not gonna win the war.

754
01:17:26,718 --> 01:17:30,889
Nobody"s gonna care that we die.

755
01:17:30,889 --> 01:17:35,060
""Which many signify that you should
snarl and bite and play the dog.""

756
01:17:37,145 --> 01:17:41,316
- Not me.
- Shakespeare?

757
01:17:41,316 --> 01:17:45,487


758
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:46,530
Very good.

759
01:17:44,444 --> 01:17:48,615


760
01:18:33,452 --> 01:18:37,622
Cicero, this is Libby. Over.

761
01:18:37,622 --> 01:18:41,793
Cicero, come in. Over.

762
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:43,879


763
01:18:41,793 --> 01:18:45,964
Goddamn radiation!
Come on, we"ve got to get closer.

764
01:18:47,007 --> 01:18:51,178


765
01:18:56,391 --> 01:19:00,562
- Come on down.
- We"re right in front of the door.

766
01:18:56,391 --> 01:19:00,562
- Come on down.
- We"re right in front of the door.

767
01:19:02,647 --> 01:19:06,818
- Come out. Over.
- Bad connection, Joe.

768
01:19:07,861 --> 01:19:12,032
l"ve got NEBs with me.
Come on up.

769
01:19:12,032 --> 01:19:16,203
You're breaking up, Joe.

770
01:19:15,160 --> 01:19:19,331


771
01:19:19,331 --> 01:19:23,501
- Come up out of the bunker.
- Come on down, Joe.

772
01:19:25,587 --> 01:19:29,758


773
01:19:29,758 --> 01:19:33,929
You come up, Chuck.

774
01:19:33,929 --> 01:19:38,099


775
01:19:36,014 --> 01:19:40,185
- Chuck, that"s an order.
- Come on down. Over.

776
01:19:41,227 --> 01:19:45,398


777
01:19:45,398 --> 01:19:49,569
- Chuck . . .
- Come on down. Over.

778
01:19:48,526 --> 01:19:52,697


779
01:19:50,612 --> 01:19:54,783
- Let me speak to Don Giovanni.
- This is Don Giovanni.

780
01:19:54,783 --> 01:19:58,953
Come on down. Over.

781
01:19:58,953 --> 01:20:03,124
- This is your old pal Wolfgang.
- l will open the door. Over.

782
01:20:08,338 --> 01:20:12,509


783
01:20:09,381 --> 01:20:13,551
l"m coming down right now.
Do you copy?

784
01:20:13,551 --> 01:20:17,722
- Come down. Over.
- l"m coming in . . . Go!

785
01:20:19,808 --> 01:20:23,978


786
01:21:29,669 --> 01:21:33,840
Watch the flame.

787
01:21:32,797 --> 01:21:36,968


788
01:22:05,121 --> 01:22:09,292
- Give me the nuke!
- What?

789
01:22:08,249 --> 01:22:12,420
Give me the mini-pluto
you stole out of the bunker!

790
01:22:13,463 --> 01:22:17,633


791
01:22:18,676 --> 01:22:22,847
- Loading.
- Watch your heads.

792
01:22:22,847 --> 01:22:27,018


793
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:28,061
Hang on!

794
01:22:25,975 --> 01:22:30,146


795
01:23:09,769 --> 01:23:13,940
Help me!

796
01:23:10,812 --> 01:23:14,982
Help me!

797
01:23:12,897 --> 01:23:17,068


798
01:23:28,538 --> 01:23:32,708
- Help me!
- Sir!

799
01:23:30,623 --> 01:23:34,794


800
01:23:33,751 --> 01:23:37,922
Help me!

801
01:23:35,837 --> 01:23:40,007
- Sir.
- l"m okay, Jefferson.

802
01:23:40,007 --> 01:23:44,178
- What about you?
- Becker"s down. He"s wounded.

803
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:49,392


804
01:23:47,306 --> 01:23:51,477
Becker . . .

805
01:23:50,434 --> 01:23:54,605


806
01:23:53,563 --> 01:23:57,733
- He"s wounded . . .
- Hold on, man.

807
01:23:58,776 --> 01:24:02,947
Wounded.

808
01:24:01,904 --> 01:24:06,075


809
01:24:02,947 --> 01:24:07,118
- Help me.
- Jefferson! No!

810
01:24:07,118 --> 01:24:11,289
Down! Down to hell!
And say that l sent you there.

811
01:24:12,331 --> 01:24:16,502


812
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:18,587
""l came into the world
with my legs forward.""

813
01:24:18,587 --> 01:24:22,758
""And the woman cried,
"He was born with teeth!"""

814
01:24:23,801 --> 01:24:27,972


815
01:24:47,783 --> 01:24:51,954
l had no father.
l am my own father.

816
01:24:50,911 --> 01:24:55,082


817
01:24:51,954 --> 01:24:56,125
l have no brother
l am my own brother.

818
01:24:55,082 --> 01:24:59,253


819
01:25:07,595 --> 01:25:11,766
This word love,
which old farts call blind, -

820
01:25:12,808 --> 01:25:16,979
- be resident in men like you,
asshole, but not in me.

821
01:25:16,979 --> 01:25:21,150


822
01:25:18,022 --> 01:25:22,193
l am my motherfucking self. Alone!

823
01:25:22,193 --> 01:25:26,363


824
01:25:40,961 --> 01:25:45,132
Jefferson!

825
01:25:44,089 --> 01:25:48,260


826
01:25:51,388 --> 01:25:55,559
We"re gonna die.

827
01:25:54,517 --> 01:25:58,687


828
01:25:55,559 --> 01:25:59,730
You know that, don"t you?

829
01:25:58,687 --> 01:26:02,858


830
01:26:05,986 --> 01:26:10,157
Yeah . . .

831
01:26:09,114 --> 01:26:13,285


832
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:15,371
. . . but not today . . .

833
01:26:15,371 --> 01:26:19,541
. . . and not here.

834
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:23,712
Where will we go?

835
01:26:24,755 --> 01:26:28,926
Where do you go
when there"s nowhere else to go?

836
01:26:28,926 --> 01:26:33,097
Home.

837
01:26:29,969 --> 01:26:34,139


838
01:26:32,054 --> 01:26:36,225
Earth.

839
01:26:33,097 --> 01:26:37,267
Earth.

840
01:26:36,225 --> 01:26:40,396
There"s an emergency escape vehicle
for use by the commanding officer.

841
01:26:43,524 --> 01:26:47,695
lt"s hidden in these mountains
in a place named ironically -

842
01:26:47,695 --> 01:26:51,865
- for where they developed the
first atomic bomb. Alamogordo.

843
01:26:56,036 --> 01:27:00,207
l"ve never been there.

844
01:26:59,164 --> 01:27:03,335
- What are you talking about?
- There"s a way off this planet.

845
01:27:05,421 --> 01:27:09,591


846
01:27:11,677 --> 01:27:15,848
- Type 2?
- Hell if l know.

847
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:21,061
l"ve never even seen this tag.
l"ve never even seen this language.

848
01:27:21,061 --> 01:27:25,232


849
01:27:27,317 --> 01:27:31,488
Can l see it?

850
01:27:30,446 --> 01:27:34,616


851
01:27:35,659 --> 01:27:39,830
Yeah.

852
01:27:37,744 --> 01:27:41,915


853
01:27:44,001 --> 01:27:48,172
God! l"m sorry.

854
01:27:48,172 --> 01:27:52,342


855
01:27:49,214 --> 01:27:53,385
Give it to me. l"m sorry.

856
01:27:53,385 --> 01:27:57,556


857
01:27:56,513 --> 01:28:00,684
l had to know.

858
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:03,812


859
01:28:00,684 --> 01:28:04,855
No! Don"t do that . . .
you don"t need to.

860
01:28:05,898 --> 01:28:10,068


861
01:29:25,143 --> 01:29:29,314
- That"s the last one.
- lt"s okay.

862
01:29:29,314 --> 01:29:33,485
According to this
we should be close.

863
01:29:33,485 --> 01:29:37,656
- Does that locator work?
- Yeah.

864
01:29:37,656 --> 01:29:41,827


865
01:29:38,698 --> 01:29:42,869
- ls it up there?
- lt should be.

866
01:29:41,827 --> 01:29:45,997


867
01:29:42,869 --> 01:29:47,040
- l don"t see anything.
- That"s the idea.

868
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:51,211


869
01:29:54,339 --> 01:29:58,510
l can"t go on any more.
l don"t want to go on any more.

870
01:29:59,553 --> 01:30:03,723


871
01:30:07,894 --> 01:30:12,065
Listen to me. l don"t have anybody.

872
01:30:11,022 --> 01:30:15,193
l don"t have a family or a friend
or that kid Jefferson.

873
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:21,449
l don"t even have him.
But l have you, do you hear me?

874
01:30:22,492 --> 01:30:26,663
l have you, and we"re going home.

875
01:30:26,663 --> 01:30:30,834


876
01:30:30,834 --> 01:30:35,005
l"m taking you home.

877
01:30:33,962 --> 01:30:38,133


878
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:46,474
BERYNlUM WAS DlSCOVERED HERE
ON JULY 1 6, 2064.

879
01:30:46,474 --> 01:30:50,645


880
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,731
When l took over command,
this was coded in my bio-signature.

881
01:30:53,773 --> 01:30:57,944
- lt only works for you?
- We"ll soon find out.

882
01:30:55,859 --> 01:31:00,030
- lt only works for you?
- We"ll soon find out.

883
01:30:57,944 --> 01:31:02,115


884
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:08,371
Then l"m with the right guy.

885
01:31:08,371 --> 01:31:12,542


886
01:32:20,318 --> 01:32:24,489
- What do we do?
- l have no idea.

887
01:32:24,489 --> 01:32:28,660
Let"s try this chair.

888
01:32:27,617 --> 01:32:31,788


889
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:32,831
What about this?

890
01:32:32,831 --> 01:32:37,001
Elevator activated.

891
01:32:35,959 --> 01:32:40,129


892
01:32:38,044 --> 01:32:42,215
Countdown to launch commencing.

893
01:32:41,172 --> 01:32:45,343


894
01:32:42,215 --> 01:32:46,386
lt"s moving. Get on.

895
01:32:45,343 --> 01:32:49,514


896
01:32:48,471 --> 01:32:52,642
Hang on.
The crane"s blocking the trajectory.

897
01:32:52,642 --> 01:32:56,813
- l"ll be down.
- Okay.

898
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:59,941


899
01:32:56,813 --> 01:33:00,984
Please clear launch pad.

900
01:33:02,026 --> 01:33:06,197


901
01:33:03,069 --> 01:33:07,240
Gantry inoperable.
Circuit malfunction.

902
01:33:09,325 --> 01:33:13,496


903
01:34:23,357 --> 01:34:27,528
Launch sequence initiated.

904
01:34:25,443 --> 01:34:29,614


905
01:34:26,486 --> 01:34:30,656
Time to launch: 15 minutes.

906
01:34:29,614 --> 01:34:33,784


907
01:34:52,553 --> 01:34:56,724
- Chuck!
- Remember that bar at Point Reyes?

908
01:34:55,681 --> 01:34:59,852


909
01:34:57,767 --> 01:35:01,938
l guess you"ll never see it again.

910
01:35:00,895 --> 01:35:05,066


911
01:35:10,279 --> 01:35:14,450
We all die alone, Joe.

912
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:17,578


913
01:35:54,073 --> 01:35:58,244
Like the new look, Commander?

914
01:35:57,201 --> 01:36:01,372
What do you think?
ls this me, or what?

915
01:36:01,372 --> 01:36:05,543
l liked the other face better.

916
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:08,671
Do you know who l got it from?
Marshall Richard Cooper.

917
01:36:09,714 --> 01:36:13,884
Name ring a bell?
Do you know how we got it off him?

918
01:36:14,927 --> 01:36:19,098
Just like your buddy Chuck,
we ripped it off.

919
01:36:18,055 --> 01:36:22,226
He was screaming
something about God and Jesus.

920
01:36:22,226 --> 01:36:26,397


921
01:36:35,781 --> 01:36:39,952
You"re in the wrong place.

922
01:36:38,909 --> 01:36:43,080


923
01:36:39,952 --> 01:36:44,123
l took his face.
He didn"t have much use for it.

924
01:36:44,123 --> 01:36:48,294
But l like your face better.

925
01:36:46,208 --> 01:36:50,379


926
01:36:48,294 --> 01:36:52,464
""She couldn"t take it. She married
and moved on, and l"m still here.""

927
01:36:53,507 --> 01:36:57,678


928
01:36:58,721 --> 01:37:02,892
Obstruction cleared.
Prelaunch proceeding.

929
01:37:02,892 --> 01:37:07,062
Down to hell,
and say that l sent you.

930
01:37:07,062 --> 01:37:11,233
""l came into the world
with my legs forward . . .""

931
01:37:12,276 --> 01:37:16,447


932
01:37:59,198 --> 01:38:03,369
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Let"s go.

933
01:38:03,369 --> 01:38:07,539

- Damn.
- One seat. One life support system.

937
01:38:17,966 --> 01:38:22,137


938
01:38:21,095 --> 01:38:25,265
Get in. We"ve got eight minutes
for you to get out of here.

939
01:38:27,351 --> 01:38:31,522
- You know how to fly it.
- lt"ll fly by itself.

940
01:38:32,564 --> 01:38:36,735
Shit!

941
01:38:35,692 --> 01:38:39,863


942
01:38:37,778 --> 01:38:41,949
l"ll flip you for it.
Call it. Heads or sphinx.

943
01:38:44,034 --> 01:38:48,205
Rome, Egypt.
l"ll flip it. You call it.

944
01:38:50,290 --> 01:38:54,461
All right, Cleopatra, l"ll call it.
Rome.

945
01:38:53,418 --> 01:38:57,589


946
01:38:57,589 --> 01:39:01,760
lt doesn"t matter. You"re going.

947
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:05,931
Now, go.

948
01:39:04,888 --> 01:39:09,059


949
01:39:14,273 --> 01:39:18,443
l can"t . . .

950
01:39:16,358 --> 01:39:20,529
Pardon me, gentlemen,
would you mind taking that outside?

951
01:39:20,529 --> 01:39:24,700


952
01:39:21,572 --> 01:39:25,742
Stray bullets
are bad for the inventory.

953
01:39:24,700 --> 01:39:28,871
Jessica Hansen, Pittsburgh.
How do you do?

954
01:39:27,828 --> 01:39:31,999


955
01:39:29,913 --> 01:39:34,084
We can smile, we can cry,
we can bleed.

956
01:39:33,041 --> 01:39:37,212


957
01:39:34,084 --> 01:39:38,255
We can fuck.

958
01:39:36,169 --> 01:39:40,340


959
01:39:39,298 --> 01:39:43,468
l wanted to tell you. l did.

960
01:39:42,426 --> 01:39:46,597


961
01:39:55,981 --> 01:40:00,152
Not so fast.

962
01:39:59,109 --> 01:40:03,280


963
01:40:53,330 --> 01:40:57,501
Two minutes to launch.

964
01:40:56,458 --> 01:41:00,629


965
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,970
Hey, bitch!

966
01:41:07,928 --> 01:41:12,098

l didn"t want to . . .

970
01:42:01,106 --> 01:42:05,277


971
01:42:02,148 --> 01:42:06,319
. . . go back with you. l was afraid.

972
01:42:08,405 --> 01:42:12,575
l know. You were afraid
of what you would do.

973
01:42:15,704 --> 01:42:19,874


974
01:42:19,874 --> 01:42:24,045
You"re coming up in the world.

975
01:42:24,045 --> 01:42:28,216
You"ve learned
how to kill each other now.

976
01:42:27,173 --> 01:42:31,344


977
01:42:30,301 --> 01:42:34,472
l learned something else, too.
l learned to . . .

978
01:42:38,643 --> 01:42:42,814


979
01:42:40,729 --> 01:42:44,899
