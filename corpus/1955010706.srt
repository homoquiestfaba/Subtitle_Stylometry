1
00:00:45,733 --> 00:00:51,771
"And the prince took the beautiful young girl
in his arms and said, "Will you marry me?"

2
00:00:52,823 --> 00:00:57,152
"Yes, she whispered,
“ I will be your princess. "

3
00:00:57,244 --> 00:01:00,198
Did they live happily ever after?

4
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:03,622
Of course, Elizabeth.

5
00:01:04,626 --> 00:01:06,453
How do you know?

6
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:09,250
Because she was a good little girl.

7
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:13,004
If she had been naughty,
the prince would have run away.

8
00:01:14,136 --> 00:01:16,175
What a pile of shit.

9
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:00,693
Oh, Charlie.

10
00:03:03,242 --> 00:03:06,492
Charles, this is really important to me.

11
00:03:06,578 --> 00:03:09,199
I forgive you. OK?

12
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,372
I love you.

13
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:18,081
God, that hurts so much
when I say it out loud.

14
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:21,922
OK, Lizzie.

15
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:26,263
Charles, our marriage...

16
00:03:26,347 --> 00:03:29,348
No, this is really important to me.

17
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:31,473
Charles, this is really...

18
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:34,139
OK, Charles.

19
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:41,017
Charles...

20
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:44,563
- Lizzie, shouldn’t you be having lunch?
- This is important.

21
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:46,696
- Let me finish.
- You agreed.

22
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:50,733
You did more than agree.
It was your idea and you were right.

23
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:54,448
You were absolutely right. We can’t go on.

24
00:03:55,459 --> 00:04:01,711
Sooner or later one of us has got to do something
positive for once in our life for both our sakes.

25
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:03,838
- And you did it.
- I did?

26
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:06,713
- Yes.
- Wait. When was it my idea?

27
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:10,552
The best thing is for me to go
and live with Annabelle.

28
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,392
- I don’t think I said that.
- Yes.

29
00:04:13,476 --> 00:04:16,726
- I did? Annabelle? Is that her name?
- Yes.

30
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:18,722
Oh, God. I didn’t know that.

31
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:23,144
- All I know is what you did with her on our sofa.
- Lizzie, I'm sorry.

32
00:04:23,236 --> 00:04:26,106
I couldn’t help myself.
I've been smitten by Annabelle.

33
00:04:26,197 --> 00:04:28,024
I’ve been bewitched by her.

34
00:04:28,116 --> 00:04:33,655
I have been pounded flat on the anvil of love
like a piece of veal with a salad on top.

35
00:04:33,746 --> 00:04:37,826
Excuse me. I test-drive this car?

36
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:47,382
This car looks great topless.

37
00:04:47,468 --> 00:04:51,002
I think a car should
represent its owner, don’t you?

38
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:54,380
Charles, this is really important to me.

39
00:04:54,475 --> 00:04:58,472
Let’s not go through all this
I-never-want-to-see-you-again stuff

40
00:04:58,562 --> 00:05:01,765
because we will want
to see each other again.

41
00:05:01,857 --> 00:05:04,561
We’re not going to
throw away two years, are we?

42
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:07,735
It was three years... in June.

43
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:26,873
Janie, that’s what he said.
He said he wants...

44
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:30,168
He wants to move out
and go live with Annabelle.

45
00:05:31,928 --> 00:05:34,169
I know.

46
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:36,422
If I could just be alone with him.

47
00:05:45,816 --> 00:05:49,648
Yes, it’s hard to
look on the bright side but...

48
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:51,610
Mm-hm.

49
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:54,733
Yes. I’ve got my car.

50
00:05:54,825 --> 00:06:00,163
I guess I'll stay in the apartment
but, Janie, I really want him back.

51
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:03,331
If I could just get
him alone and talk to him.

52
00:06:04,417 --> 00:06:06,244
Janie?

53
00:06:06,336 --> 00:06:10,797
Janie, hold on. Hold on a second.
I'm just gonna get some change.

54
00:06:13,593 --> 00:06:16,001
Hey, that’s my car!

55
00:06:16,095 --> 00:06:18,135
"Elizabeth!

56
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:23,513
"Don’t spend any more money on Charles.
Elizabeth, I’ll see you later anyway. "

57
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:41,449
I’m so sorry, Your Honour.
I lost my money, my car, my husband.

58
00:06:42,246 --> 00:06:44,369
All in one lunch hour?

59
00:06:45,332 --> 00:06:49,282
- Yeah.
- Hey, do what I did. Plead insanity.

60
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:55,048
Counsel, advise your client
to keep his remarks to himself.

61
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:58,419
Sorry, Your Honour.
May we finally proceed?

62
00:06:58,512 --> 00:07:02,805
Just a moment. Could the court reporter
approach the bench, please?

63
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,557
- I’m sorry.
- So am I.

64
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:11,687
You’re fired.

65
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:40,048
- Thank you.
- Are you OK?

66
00:07:40,135 --> 00:07:41,546
Mm-hm.

67
00:07:41,637 --> 00:07:43,676
Lizzie?

68
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:45,803
- Elizabeth Cronin?
- Yeah.

69
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:48,596
I’m Michael. Mickey.
I’m Mickey Bunce.

70
00:07:49,686 --> 00:07:52,972
Used to live down the street
when we were little kids.

71
00:07:53,065 --> 00:07:55,686
- Mickey. Goodness.
- Yeah!

72
00:07:55,776 --> 00:07:57,602
- It’s been 20 years.
- At least.

73
00:07:57,694 --> 00:07:59,521
- Do you work here?
- No.

74
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,400
- Neither do I.
- No. I had a divorce here.

75
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,530
- Divorce?
- Yes.

76
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:07,073
Ah, I don’t like that word.

77
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:11,788
You’ve got to work things through
if you don’t want to get divorced.

78
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:17,045
I gave it my best shot
but we’ve been separated two years now.

79
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,835
The good thing about it is I got to keep
my daughter. That’s Natalie.

80
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:26,094
- She’s real pretty.
- She’s beautiful.

81
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,549
She’s a lot to handle.
She’s a lot like you used to be.

82
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:31,967
- Like me?
- Yeah.

83
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:34,552
What do you mean?

84
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,648
Don’t you remember
what you did to my grandmother?

85
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:41,184
- I didn’t do anything to her.
- You said the same thing then.

86
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:42,903
You said that Fred did it.

87
00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:47,738
Drop Dead Fred.

88
00:08:50,412 --> 00:08:52,451
Grandma Bunce!

89
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:02,960
- Drop Dead Fred.
- I used to pretend I had an imaginary friend.

90
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,089
No one believed me.

91
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:11,012
Do you remember the time you and Fred
came over to borrow my father’s electric shaver?

92
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:13,138
Yes.

93
00:09:26,781 --> 00:09:30,031
- You must have thought I was crazy.
- Not at all.

94
00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:33,901
I believed you. It was just that
no one else could see him but you.

95
00:09:35,205 --> 00:09:39,535
- He was so real.
- He was real all right. Really out of control.

96
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:41,666
No, not always.

97
00:09:41,754 --> 00:09:43,793
Only when my mother was...

98
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,629
Well, you know.

99
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:49,920
Hey, we were all a
little afraid of your mother.

100
00:09:51,555 --> 00:09:54,472
Not Fred. No,
he always stood up for me.

101
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:58,009
That’s what friends are for,
even imaginary ones.

102
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,319
I realise you’re feeling
pretty conflicted right now.

103
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,277
I feel awful.

104
00:10:14,369 --> 00:10:19,992
I did this self-actualising workshop
and they taught us that pain is your friend.

105
00:10:20,082 --> 00:10:22,490
- Pain makes you interesting.
- Janie.

106
00:10:22,585 --> 00:10:25,040
Look at Elvis.

107
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:27,168
Yeah, but didn’t Elvis kill himself?

108
00:10:27,256 --> 00:10:29,628
Yes, but before that he was interesting.

109
00:10:29,717 --> 00:10:32,172
I want you to do some affirmations with me.

110
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:33,885
- Janie.
- Just do it.

111
00:10:33,971 --> 00:10:36,094
Surround yourself with light.

112
00:10:37,057 --> 00:10:39,465
Are you surrounded?

113
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,184
Yeah, I think so.

114
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,054
Repeat after me.
I don’t need a man to complete my life.

115
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:47,770
- I don’t need a man to complete my life.
- I’m perfect the way that I am.

116
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:50,529
- I’m perfect the way that I am.
- I hate Charles.

117
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:53,185
I hate Charles.

118
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:55,903
Don’t you feel better?

119
00:10:55,992 --> 00:10:58,032
No.

120
00:11:00,163 --> 00:11:02,915
I love him.
I really do.

121
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:07,581
I feel basically it’s all about choice.

122
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:13,210
Since you’ve already chosen, what you may
as well do is to choose what you chose.

123
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:16,218
- I heard.
- Hello, Mother.

124
00:11:16,304 --> 00:11:21,642
I came as soon as I heard. It’s a good
thing I've got a key to this apartment.

125
00:11:21,726 --> 00:11:27,265
Hello, Mrs Cronin. She’ll be all right.
She needs some nurturing. Give her a cuddle.

126
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:34,316
Cuddling is for teddy bears. I’ve packed
your things. You’re coming home with me.

127
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:38,402
- I’m staying here tonight.
- Charles is coming here later.

128
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:43,118
- I want to be here when he comes.
- Don’t disagree with your mother.

129
00:11:44,706 --> 00:11:47,909
I’m staying here tonight.
I’m staying here tonight.

130
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:57,791
Now that we’re home,
everything is perfect.

131
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:12,809
- Don’t step on that carpet. I had it shampooed.
- Yes, Mother.

132
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,692
Take your things upstairs.

133
00:12:15,945 --> 00:12:18,068
- I made up your bed.
- Oh.

134
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:21,738
Oh? That’s all you say to me?

135
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:25,989
- Thank you, Mother.
- That’s a good girl.

136
00:16:12,466 --> 00:16:15,965
- Boo! Hello, snot face!
- Argh!

137
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:22,423
Yeugh! What happened to you? Look at you.
You’re all older. You’re even uglier.

138
00:16:22,518 --> 00:16:27,594
Ugh! I’m sorry I'm going to have to
be sick all over you. Lie down. Hang on.

139
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,106
- Where’s all the dolls?
- Drop Dead Fred.

140
00:16:32,194 --> 00:16:34,233
Where is the dolls?

141
00:16:35,197 --> 00:16:37,652
I want to play with the... Aha! The dolls.

142
00:16:37,741 --> 00:16:42,284
Hello, Jemima. Hello, Angelique. "Hello. "
You’re going to die. Ah!

143
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,830
Mr Pooh.

144
00:16:45,915 --> 00:16:47,955
"Hello. " You die, too.

145
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:50,082
"No, no, no!" Yes, yes, yes.

146
00:16:53,256 --> 00:16:56,589
"My intestines. Not my intestines!"

147
00:16:59,345 --> 00:17:01,421
D-E-D.

148
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:04,384
I must be dreaming.

149
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:08,435
Where’s the fire truck
and the rest of the toys?

150
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:10,394
They’re gone.

151
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:12,520
I’m grown up.

152
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,398
- Grown up?
- Uh-huh.

153
00:17:19,073 --> 00:17:21,112
Grown up?

154
00:17:24,495 --> 00:17:26,534
Great.

155
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:29,955
That means there’s a load
of grown-up things to smash.

156
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:32,081
Come on!

157
00:17:32,169 --> 00:17:35,502
- Where are we going?
- Play time!

158
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:37,546
Whee!

159
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:42,925
Who put that there?

160
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:45,928
I forgot to give you something.

161
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,472
Ha-ha-ha!

162
00:17:53,231 --> 00:17:57,311
Where is it? Come on.
There must be some here somewhere.

163
00:17:57,401 --> 00:17:59,857
Ah! Here it is.

164
00:18:01,364 --> 00:18:03,403
Mind your backs.

165
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,907
Ooh! Careful.

166
00:18:11,332 --> 00:18:13,538
I’ve got some dog poo right here.

167
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:26,130
Dog poo, dog poo, lovely, lovely dog poo
dog poo on the chair

168
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:30,005
All along the side, all up here,
lovely, lovely smelly dog poo

169
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:34,595
- Elizabeth?
- Yeah, it’s me, Mother.

170
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:38,768
- I’m just getting a glass of water.
- Uh-huh.

171
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:40,768
Well, mind the carpet.

172
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:46,355
Hey, snot face, look. Ink.

173
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:50,696
Let’s write something on the carpet.
Let’s write, "Mother sucks. "

174
00:18:50,787 --> 00:18:55,033
No. Wait a minute. I’ve a better idea.
Let’s play a game.

175
00:18:55,124 --> 00:18:58,707
- A game?
- Yeah, a game, like we used to, in the old days.

176
00:18:58,794 --> 00:19:02,709
A game. OK.
Great. But not dolls.

177
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:05,669
Not dolls cos we’re grown-ups now.

178
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,966
Not dolls. How about hide-and-seek?

179
00:19:08,053 --> 00:19:11,921
Great. I love hide-and-seek.

180
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:15,634
Great. Maybe you should
give me that inkwell first.

181
00:19:15,728 --> 00:19:17,554
Sure. Here.

182
00:19:18,897 --> 00:19:20,724
Catch.

183
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:26,311
Nice catch. OK. Hide your eyes
and count to a million.

184
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:30,651
I’m going to hide in a place
where you’ll never find me. Bye-bye.

185
00:19:30,742 --> 00:19:32,782
Four, five...

186
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,580
What am I doing?

187
00:19:40,877 --> 00:19:42,916
What am I doing?

188
00:20:14,701 --> 00:20:16,112
Oh, boy.

189
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:18,868
I don’t know what to say.

190
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:24,828
- I didn’t want anybody to walk on my carpet.
- Yeah, I know.

191
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:31,373
But here I am, scrubbing away at what
can only be described as dog mess.

192
00:20:32,427 --> 00:20:37,552
Honestly, you’re not even back for a day
and you’re behaving like a five-year-old.

193
00:20:42,228 --> 00:20:47,851
Mother, do you remember when I was little
I had this friend? He was make-believe.

194
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:49,520
No.

195
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:52,730
Don’t you remember I was
the only one who could see him?

196
00:20:52,822 --> 00:20:55,692
No, I don’t remember Drop Dead Fred at all.

197
00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:08,291
Morning.

198
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:10,704
So who’s for snot flicking?

199
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:15,463
I hid all night in the stupid garden shed

200
00:21:15,552 --> 00:21:18,636
and you didn’t even
bother coming to look for me.

201
00:21:20,766 --> 00:21:22,390
Oh, my God.

202
00:21:22,476 --> 00:21:24,515
Is it? It is.

203
00:21:25,812 --> 00:21:28,517
The megabitch. Let me at her!

204
00:21:30,275 --> 00:21:32,398
- Is this for me?
- Get me an axe.

205
00:21:32,485 --> 00:21:36,779
No, get me a chainsaw.
I’m going to slice her into tiny pieces.

206
00:21:36,865 --> 00:21:41,158
Mother, are you going to be doing
any gardening today?

207
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:43,865
Well, it is a lovely day for it.

208
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:50,665
The death breath.
She killed me with the death breath.

209
00:21:52,088 --> 00:21:54,875
Be gone, evil one!

210
00:21:56,008 --> 00:22:00,884
Hey, maybe there’s a steak in there.
We can drive it through her heart.

211
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:07,807
Brrrr!

212
00:22:22,534 --> 00:22:24,277
Phew.

213
00:22:25,787 --> 00:22:27,365
Uh!

214
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:30,824
My head!
The megabitch squashed my head!

215
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:33,123
The bitch.
She squashed my head.

216
00:22:33,211 --> 00:22:35,250
The evil one reigns supreme.

217
00:22:48,226 --> 00:22:50,265
There’s nothing I can do.

218
00:22:57,026 --> 00:22:59,813
Aah! Phew.

219
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:08,658
Wow.

220
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:10,572
Cobwebs.

221
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:17,368
What’s so funny?

222
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:21,163
Nothing. Would you come
sit here with me, Mother?

223
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,005
- Go away.
- You want me to go away?

224
00:23:25,095 --> 00:23:28,298
All right. Fine.
Say the magic words and I’ll piss off.

225
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,474
- Piss off.
- Gotcha. Those weren’t the magic words.

226
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:35,639
- What did you say to me?
- She told you to piss off. Are you deaf?

227
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:42,100
I said piss off but I did not say it to you.

228
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:46,947
Well, it’s no wonder Charles left you.

229
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:50,033
You just don’t know
how to make a marriage work.

230
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:55,362
You got married? You mean
you’ve been doing it like the pigeons? No.

231
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,916
Yuck!

232
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:02,964
There they are. Which one of you two did it?
Was it you?

233
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:06,797
Whoever taught her how to do it
is going to get flattened.

234
00:24:09,596 --> 00:24:13,546
There! Come back!

235
00:24:13,642 --> 00:24:15,681
She’s absolutely insane.

236
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:18,889
- Pigeon pie for you.
- Fred, stop!

237
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:24,729
So you got married.
Snot face grew up and got married.

238
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:26,776
Fred, what are you doing here?

239
00:24:26,863 --> 00:24:31,026
I’m stuck cos your stupid, ugly, fat,
grown-up husband has left you.

240
00:24:31,117 --> 00:24:33,822
So you’re all alone and you’re all unhappy.

241
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:39,700
I had to come back and I can’t get home again
until you’re happy. Why don’t you get happy?

242
00:24:41,836 --> 00:24:43,875
OK.

243
00:24:46,257 --> 00:24:51,002
The only thing that could make me happy
would be getting Charles back.

244
00:24:51,095 --> 00:24:54,428
- All right. Let’s get Charles back. I'll help you.
- OK.

245
00:24:54,515 --> 00:24:57,088
- You’ll help me?
- Yeah, I’ll help you.

246
00:24:57,184 --> 00:24:59,224
When have you ever helped me?

247
00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:03,012
- All the time. That’s what I do.
- You’ve never helped me.

248
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:05,479
- Excuse me. Yes, I have.
- Did not.

249
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:07,394
- Did so.
- You did not.

250
00:25:07,486 --> 00:25:09,525
- I did.
- You did not.

251
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:13,741
- Did not, did not, did not!
- I did, I did, I did!

252
00:25:13,825 --> 00:25:15,782
Right, that’s it. I hate you.

253
00:25:15,869 --> 00:25:20,246
- Ow!
- Goodbye forever. I hope you die horribly.

254
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:22,371
Fred, come back.

255
00:25:22,459 --> 00:25:24,285
Fred!

256
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:29,876
You don’t want me anymore? Well, fine.

257
00:25:29,966 --> 00:25:34,046
I’ll throw myself in front of
the first... fire truck that I can see.

258
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:36,972
- Fred.
- You’re going to be sorry.

259
00:25:37,056 --> 00:25:38,965
- Go ahead.
- Goodbye.

260
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:44,097
Argh!

261
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:52,901
What have I done?

262
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,052
Wake up.

263
00:26:17,137 --> 00:26:19,710
Snot face, wake up. Wake up!

264
00:26:19,806 --> 00:26:22,723
- What is it?
- It’s time to play burglars.

265
00:26:22,809 --> 00:26:25,181
- Real burglars?
- Real burglars.

266
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:29,054
The kind that wear sweaters
and Buster Browns. Look.

267
00:26:29,148 --> 00:26:30,311
Da-da!

268
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,439
I made your sweater stripy.

269
00:26:45,623 --> 00:26:47,033
Great.

270
00:26:47,124 --> 00:26:49,164
- What is it?
- Look.

271
00:26:52,421 --> 00:26:54,046
It’s a burglar bag.

272
00:26:58,302 --> 00:27:00,341
Nigel. Nigel!

273
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:02,302
I think I heard something.

274
00:27:12,941 --> 00:27:14,980
What are we doing this for?

275
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:17,107
Glues. OK. It’s perfect.

276
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:21,987
Let’s go. We’ll steal gold and we’ll
steal silver and we’ll steal jewels

277
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:25,526
and hide them where no one
will ever find them, including us.

278
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,659
Promise?

279
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:29,490
I promise.

280
00:27:33,336 --> 00:27:34,960
Let’s go, burglar.

281
00:27:36,797 --> 00:27:39,205
This is very expensive.

282
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,589
Then we’d better be very careful.

283
00:27:43,596 --> 00:27:45,635
What was that?

284
00:27:47,474 --> 00:27:51,852
- OK. Come on.
- The coast is clear.

285
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:54,060
Shh. Shh.

286
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,227
Aha!

287
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:06,403
Hey, snot face.
Look at this.

288
00:28:07,577 --> 00:28:10,068
Eeeeeh!

289
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:15,040
Oh, no. Gladiolas.

290
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:18,373
A- A-A-chooo!

291
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:24,926
Ow!

292
00:28:30,099 --> 00:28:33,349
- Are you all right, Fred?
- Yes, I'm all right.

293
00:28:36,731 --> 00:28:38,972
- Hello, police?
- Are they there?

294
00:28:39,066 --> 00:28:41,225
- Hello.
- Give them the address.

295
00:28:41,318 --> 00:28:43,145
Tell them there’s a burglar.

296
00:28:43,237 --> 00:28:45,858
OK, buddy, what shall we steal now?

297
00:28:45,948 --> 00:28:48,653
- How about the telephone?
- Good idea.

298
00:28:48,742 --> 00:28:53,784
- That’s probably where the diamonds are hidden.
- Yeah! Great idea.

299
00:28:53,872 --> 00:28:55,699
Hello?

300
00:28:55,791 --> 00:28:58,246
What’s the matter?
Where’d they go?

301
00:28:58,335 --> 00:29:00,411
- They’ve cut the phone line.
- Oh, my God!

302
00:29:01,296 --> 00:29:04,997
Now it’s time to make
our getaway through here.

303
00:29:05,092 --> 00:29:10,252
Now, opening a window requires
great sophisticatedliness.

304
00:29:10,347 --> 00:29:12,802
- So I'd better do it, OK?
- OK.

305
00:29:15,977 --> 00:29:18,017
Ha! Ouch.

306
00:29:20,148 --> 00:29:22,187
I love those breaking noises.

307
00:29:24,485 --> 00:29:27,605
- Oh, my God. I’m having a heart attack.
- Shh!

308
00:29:32,827 --> 00:29:35,662
Shh. Shh!

309
00:29:37,998 --> 00:29:39,790
OK.

310
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,500
- OK.
- Come on, Fred.

311
00:29:43,587 --> 00:29:45,912
Right, let’s do it.

312
00:29:50,803 --> 00:29:54,670
OK, we’ll bury the treasure here
and no one will find it.

313
00:30:02,022 --> 00:30:03,849
Oh, mind that.

314
00:30:09,946 --> 00:30:11,986
We’ve been found out.

315
00:30:14,868 --> 00:30:17,952
- It’s dark in there.
- Be careful. Stay low.

316
00:30:20,581 --> 00:30:22,621
Kick it in.

317
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:24,666
Ow!

318
00:30:24,752 --> 00:30:26,875
Stay down here.

319
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:29,370
- What shall we do?
- Make a run for it.

320
00:30:29,465 --> 00:30:34,590
No. It’s too late for that now.
Snot face, I’m going to take the rap alone.

321
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:37,086
- No.
- Yes. Give me the guilty sweater.

322
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:39,423
No!

323
00:30:39,517 --> 00:30:40,927
Snot face.

324
00:30:42,728 --> 00:30:46,975
A guy’s coming up the stairs.
I’m going to ask him what he wants.

325
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:48,608
Don’t leave me.

326
00:30:48,692 --> 00:30:50,850
Keep cool.

327
00:30:52,738 --> 00:30:54,446
Argh!

328
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,069
Nigel, don’t die!

329
00:31:02,706 --> 00:31:09,325
Right. I want you to tell them loud and clear
and proud, "Drop Dead Fred did it. "

330
00:31:09,421 --> 00:31:11,460
- I’m no coward.
- I don’t want to.

331
00:31:11,548 --> 00:31:13,955
Just do it, no brain.

332
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,292
- Go on.
- Drop Dead...

333
00:31:17,512 --> 00:31:19,551
Drop Dead Fred...

334
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:25,809
I didn’t say it right. Fred?

335
00:31:26,771 --> 00:31:29,392
Hey, I thought you weren’t a coward.

336
00:31:29,482 --> 00:31:33,349
I’m not a coward. Have they gone?

337
00:31:33,444 --> 00:31:38,070
Why are you taking my husband?
It's a mistake. I am calling our lawyer.

338
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:40,778
- Go inside.
- Why are you going with them?

339
00:31:40,868 --> 00:31:44,319
- We are pillars of the community.
- Get a grip.

340
00:31:44,413 --> 00:31:47,367
What will the neighbours think? Officer...

341
00:31:48,917 --> 00:31:50,957
Maybe Mommy’s right.

342
00:31:51,044 --> 00:31:53,666
I never do anything right.

343
00:31:53,755 --> 00:31:57,456
So what? What are you saying that for?

344
00:31:57,551 --> 00:32:00,338
You’re great. She’s not.

345
00:32:00,428 --> 00:32:05,055
She’s always fighting with your dad
and calling you horrible things.

346
00:32:05,141 --> 00:32:07,928
Look, you’ve got to be what you want to be.

347
00:32:08,019 --> 00:32:10,427
Don’t you ever be like her.

348
00:32:10,522 --> 00:32:12,561
- Promise?
- Promise.

349
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:14,688
OK.

350
00:32:15,902 --> 00:32:17,526
Ow!

351
00:32:17,612 --> 00:32:19,651
Got you, Fred.

352
00:32:20,782 --> 00:32:22,489
Hey!

353
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:35,164
Elizabeth, what are you doing?
Get dressed. We’re late.

354
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:41,299
Mother, can we talk
about when I was little?

355
00:32:41,385 --> 00:32:45,632
We haven’t got time. We have to get you
back with Charles and I can do it.

356
00:32:45,722 --> 00:32:47,762
Let’s go.

357
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:57,602
There. You see what I mean?
You look wonderful.

358
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,820
Now, Elizabeth, don’t worry.
All these products are cruelty-free.

359
00:33:02,906 --> 00:33:07,034
No, you see, I think it should
definitely be more like mine.

360
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:09,027
More blush here.

361
00:33:11,497 --> 00:33:17,002
Oh, yes. Much more grown-up.
Charles is going to love this.

362
00:33:20,047 --> 00:33:22,170
Oh.

363
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:24,500
A note, Elizabeth, to you.

364
00:33:26,053 --> 00:33:29,636
- It’s from Charles.
- More bad news, no doubt.

365
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:34,931
"Dear Lizzie, I came by but no one was here
so I thought I’d leave this note.

366
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,725
"I miss our mornings. "

367
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,938
"I miss our mornings. "

368
00:33:40,025 --> 00:33:43,192
- You can’t go to work.
- I love you but I’ve got to go.

369
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:45,485
"The little games we used to play.

370
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:48,905
"You have the softest touch. "

371
00:33:48,992 --> 00:33:51,032
Ooh! Ow.

372
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:56,871
"You’re like a Lynch Bages "83,
a fine wine that’s sure to age well.

373
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:00,293
"Please come home. "

374
00:34:00,378 --> 00:34:04,079
"I’ll wait for you at our apartment. "
At last he wants to talk.

375
00:34:04,174 --> 00:34:08,800
It’s more than your father did when he left.
Does he say anything else?

376
00:34:08,887 --> 00:34:11,424
Just one more thing. "Love, Charlie. "

377
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:16,594
Charles.

378
00:34:16,686 --> 00:34:18,725
Charlie.

379
00:34:30,491 --> 00:34:34,026
- Shit yourself?
- God, I thought you were dead.

380
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:37,737
It takes more than a fire truck
to stop Drop Dead Fred.

381
00:34:37,831 --> 00:34:40,702
You have to leave.
I’m expecting Charles.

382
00:34:40,793 --> 00:34:44,078
Expecting Charles.
That’s important. I'd better go.

383
00:34:44,171 --> 00:34:47,670
- There’s a problem. Charles isn’t coming.
- What do you mean?

384
00:34:47,758 --> 00:34:49,880
I wrote the note.

385
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:52,673
Haven’t got a husband!
Haven’t got a husband!

386
00:34:52,762 --> 00:34:54,589
Got a stupid haircut!

387
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:57,682
"Look at my horrid,
stupid haircut, everybody. "

388
00:34:57,767 --> 00:35:00,223
Na na na-na na!
Looks just like her mother.

389
00:35:00,311 --> 00:35:02,434
Another little megabeast.

390
00:35:04,149 --> 00:35:06,188
It was only a joke.

391
00:35:07,151 --> 00:35:08,978
It was just a joke.

392
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:12,110
Snot face.

393
00:35:12,198 --> 00:35:14,237
It was just a joke.

394
00:35:15,618 --> 00:35:17,657
Come on.

395
00:35:17,745 --> 00:35:20,699
Hey. Look. Look.

396
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,245
Da da-da da-da-da da!

397
00:35:28,422 --> 00:35:30,462
Want a cookie?

398
00:35:38,515 --> 00:35:41,137
What’s the matter?

399
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:44,346
I really thought that Charles wanted me back.

400
00:35:45,897 --> 00:35:47,937
What’s so special about him?

401
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:51,521
I mean, can he make you puke?

402
00:35:51,611 --> 00:35:53,818
- Not like you can.
- Nah.

403
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:57,354
So what, then?

404
00:35:59,494 --> 00:36:02,364
- Do you really want to know, Fred?
- Yeah.

405
00:36:03,623 --> 00:36:05,414
I love him.

406
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:09,875
Why?

407
00:36:11,297 --> 00:36:13,337
I don’t know.

408
00:36:13,424 --> 00:36:18,419
He sends me flowers and brings me wine.

409
00:36:19,305 --> 00:36:21,344
He’s very romantic.

410
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:25,976
He can be really sweet sometimes.

411
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:34,608
I’ve never heard anything
so disgusting in all my life.

412
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:37,102
Bleurgh! Romance?!

413
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:39,902
Bleurgh!

414
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:46,661
- Urgh! What’s this?
- Charles’s poster for his wine-tasting party.

415
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:48,954
- Will Charles be there?
- Yeah.

416
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:53,624
- Well, let’s go.
- No. I can’t go alone.

417
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:58,920
- I’ll come with you. I’ll be your date.
- That’s really nice but no thanks.

418
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:25,031
Janie!

419
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:29,365
Janie.

420
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:38,663
- Janie, I need your help.
- At three in the morning?

421
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:42,837
What is with your hair?
Is there a Marilyn Quayle lookalike contest?

422
00:37:42,928 --> 00:37:46,628
I got this note, not from Charles,
from Drop Dead Fred.

423
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:50,424
- Who? Drop Dead?
- An imaginary friend I had as a child.

424
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:53,934
- He’s back.
- I hear you knocking but you can’t come in.

425
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:56,727
Murray is in there. You can’t stay long.

426
00:37:56,816 --> 00:38:00,683
Janie, suddenly he’s everywhere
and only I can see him.

427
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:06,021
He’s driving me crazy. It’s like he’s my
best friend and yet I’m scared to death of him.

428
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,738
- I thought I was your best friend.
- You are.

429
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:12,031
- Not just because I’m visible.
- Janie!

430
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:16,950
- Are you coming back?
- I’ll be right up, Mur.

431
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:22,205
- He’s such an animal.
- You mean he goes all night?

432
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:28,088
What do you think, he shits in the corner,
he eats with his paws? You can’t stay here.

433
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:32,427
If somebody else could see Drop Dead Fred,
then I’d know I’m not crazy.

434
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,557
Is he here now?

435
00:38:35,562 --> 00:38:37,187
- No.
- Good.

436
00:38:37,272 --> 00:38:39,893
I was going to say if he is,
I can’t see him.

437
00:38:39,983 --> 00:38:43,566
Janie, if I go home,
he’s bound to be there.

438
00:38:43,653 --> 00:38:46,061
You can’t stay here, though.

439
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:48,195
I can’t go home.

440
00:38:48,283 --> 00:38:50,489
Oh!

441
00:38:50,577 --> 00:38:53,613
- All right, stay the night.
- Thank you.

442
00:38:53,705 --> 00:38:57,999
Murray is here one night a month.
You had to pick tonight.

443
00:39:29,656 --> 00:39:32,064
Wake up. Look what I’ve done.

444
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:34,740
Elizabeth, wake up. Look.

445
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:38,237
Snot face, wake up.

446
00:39:41,168 --> 00:39:43,207
Wake up!

447
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:47,539
Wake up. What, are you shedding?

448
00:39:51,177 --> 00:39:53,419
Did you do this to yourself?

449
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:57,094
Oh! Drop Dead Fred did it.

450
00:39:57,183 --> 00:40:00,267
- He was here?
- Am I missing something?

451
00:40:00,353 --> 00:40:04,267
- Is this a girly thing?
- It’s a creative visualisation.

452
00:40:04,357 --> 00:40:06,598
She has an imaginary friend.

453
00:40:06,692 --> 00:40:09,978
Oh. I never had imaginary friends.

454
00:40:11,113 --> 00:40:13,438
Just wet dreams.

455
00:40:13,532 --> 00:40:15,940
You kiss your mother with that mouth?

456
00:40:16,035 --> 00:40:19,569
I’m going to be at work till lunch,
then I’ll be back.

457
00:40:31,383 --> 00:40:33,672
That is a very strange young lady.

458
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,212
She’s going through a difficult time
and she is a friend.

459
00:40:37,305 --> 00:40:39,345
- I’m not criticising.
- You are.

460
00:40:39,432 --> 00:40:43,845
- I’m just describing what I saw.
- Everybody has strange friends, even you.

461
00:40:43,937 --> 00:40:47,353
- But all mine are alive.
- That’s not saying much.

462
00:41:03,122 --> 00:41:05,162
Charles!

463
00:41:05,916 --> 00:41:07,743
Charles!

464
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,712
Charles!

465
00:41:14,633 --> 00:41:16,673
It’s got to be him.

466
00:41:17,553 --> 00:41:19,380
It looks just like our boat.

467
00:41:30,315 --> 00:41:32,355
I think that’s him.

468
00:41:33,652 --> 00:41:35,691
Pirates!

469
00:41:44,162 --> 00:41:47,862
- I love playing pirates.
- Fred, don’t touch anything.

470
00:41:47,957 --> 00:41:51,658
Sure. This is going to be great.
We’ll sail the seven seas.

471
00:41:51,753 --> 00:41:55,916
We’ll put on eye patches.
We’ll cut off our legs and glue on wooden ones.

472
00:41:56,007 --> 00:41:58,711
- I can’t touch anything?
- No. OK?

473
00:41:58,801 --> 00:42:01,339
Yeah, sure. I’ll just touch that one.

474
00:42:01,429 --> 00:42:05,129
- I won’t touch that one. I’ll touch that one.
- Nothing.

475
00:42:05,224 --> 00:42:09,138
- I am the pirate who doesn’t touch anything.
- That’s right.

476
00:42:09,228 --> 00:42:11,019
Except this one.

477
00:42:12,982 --> 00:42:15,223
- What did you just touch?
- Nothing.

478
00:42:15,317 --> 00:42:17,524
- What did you touch?
- The red one.

479
00:42:17,611 --> 00:42:20,067
Fred!

480
00:42:20,155 --> 00:42:25,825
The engine’s broken, that’s all. I’ll go and fix
the engine. You keep an eye out, Captain.

481
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:27,950
Aye aye, Captain.

482
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,663
Fred, he’s getting away.

483
00:42:38,506 --> 00:42:41,128
What? Faster?

484
00:42:41,217 --> 00:42:43,257
Okey-dokey.

485
00:42:59,652 --> 00:43:04,480
This way! Captain Fred’s in charge!

486
00:43:09,578 --> 00:43:13,279
Drown the fishes! Kill all the parrots!

487
00:43:32,017 --> 00:43:34,140
What is that water doing there?

488
00:43:34,227 --> 00:43:36,599
- What water?
- That water.

489
00:43:36,688 --> 00:43:40,520
I don’t know.
What are your thoughts?

490
00:43:40,608 --> 00:43:42,648
Whoa!

491
00:43:43,778 --> 00:43:45,818
Man the lifeboats!

492
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:12,925
Excuse me a minute, would you?

493
00:44:19,646 --> 00:44:22,896
- Now what’s happened?
- I have some bad news for you.

494
00:44:22,983 --> 00:44:24,560
More?

495
00:44:25,777 --> 00:44:28,399
Remember your house?

496
00:44:28,488 --> 00:44:29,899
Yeah.

497
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:34,118
It... It sank.

498
00:44:34,202 --> 00:44:36,242
What?

499
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:38,902
Er, I didn’t mean for it...

500
00:44:38,998 --> 00:44:41,572
Drop Dead Fred just...

501
00:44:42,919 --> 00:44:44,828
He was way out of control.

502
00:44:44,921 --> 00:44:48,870
Do you think I have an
imaginary-friend clause in my insurance?

503
00:44:48,966 --> 00:44:51,208
Janie, I’m so sorry.

504
00:44:51,302 --> 00:44:55,252
- Everything I own is on that boat.
- It’s all still there.

505
00:44:55,348 --> 00:44:59,262
It’s just... not so near the top of the water.

506
00:45:01,854 --> 00:45:05,223
You always tell me to look on
the bright side of things.

507
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:08,566
What would that be in
this particular situation?

508
00:45:11,822 --> 00:45:13,649
There he is.

509
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:16,318
- Murray?
- No.

510
00:45:17,035 --> 00:45:18,660
- Not...
- Yes.

511
00:45:18,745 --> 00:45:25,033
How about the silverware service? A complete
mystery to me but was completely ruined.

512
00:45:25,127 --> 00:45:26,918
Any response?

513
00:45:27,003 --> 00:45:30,787
He’s waving at us.
Wave or he might do something awful.

514
00:45:30,882 --> 00:45:33,966
- Hi!
- What’s he doing now?

515
00:45:36,596 --> 00:45:38,055
Nothing yet.

516
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:39,550
Do it to them, Murray.

517
00:45:39,641 --> 00:45:43,341
I think it’s time we got
down to specifics, don’t you?

518
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:47,434
Specifics, don’t you?
What is it? It’s gone now.

519
00:45:47,523 --> 00:45:50,726
He’s just sitting in your chair. Do you see him?

520
00:45:50,818 --> 00:45:54,768
No, but that won’t stop me
from killing the little bastard.

521
00:45:54,864 --> 00:45:57,865
But we have an item
we’d like for you to see.

522
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:00,192
The police report.

523
00:46:00,286 --> 00:46:02,907
The damage to the room was incredible.

524
00:46:02,997 --> 00:46:08,204
Excuse me, gentlemen. Hello, sweetheart.
Aren’t you a cute little thing?

525
00:46:09,086 --> 00:46:12,786
I’m just going to borrow this.
I’ll be back in a second.

526
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:23,220
Snot face.

527
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:27,806
Have I got him?

528
00:46:36,487 --> 00:46:38,527
What are you doing, Miss Shagrue?

529
00:46:38,615 --> 00:46:42,743
I’m running for Congress.
What does it look like I’m doing?

530
00:46:44,912 --> 00:46:48,495
- There’s nobody there.
- He’s invisible, idiot.

531
00:46:49,542 --> 00:46:52,792
Die! You’re dead, little man!

532
00:46:52,878 --> 00:46:54,586
That’s for the boat!

533
00:46:54,672 --> 00:46:59,914
That’s for ruining the one schtup I get
a month when Murray’s wife is out of town!

534
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:08,931
It’s very hot in here, isn’t it?

535
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:25,272
This is stupid. We ought to be in a shop
that sells harpoons and nets and hammers.

536
00:47:25,368 --> 00:47:29,069
- What for?
- We could harpoon Charles through the head,

537
00:47:29,164 --> 00:47:33,078
drag him home and hit him with the hammer
till he agrees to come back.

538
00:47:33,168 --> 00:47:35,955
- Harpoon him through the head?
- Brilliant.

539
00:47:36,045 --> 00:47:39,497
- It’s not going to work.
- How many times have you tried it?

540
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:41,963
- We’re not five any more.
- I know.

541
00:47:43,636 --> 00:47:47,883
- This would be good for the wine gala.
- It looks like a big bruise.

542
00:47:48,766 --> 00:47:52,466
- I’m going to be late for lunch.
- Who are you having lunch with?

543
00:47:52,561 --> 00:47:55,396
An old friend and I don’t mean you.

544
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:57,520
You’re not invited.

545
00:47:58,651 --> 00:48:00,690
Why not?

546
00:48:00,778 --> 00:48:03,019
We always do everything together.

547
00:48:04,198 --> 00:48:06,024
Thank you.

548
00:48:07,075 --> 00:48:11,203
- This is a great place.
- It’s Charles’s favourite restaurant.

549
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:13,660
Oh.

550
00:48:13,749 --> 00:48:15,788
You cut your hair.

551
00:48:15,876 --> 00:48:19,291
- Yeah. Charles is going to hate it.
- You look beautiful.

552
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:23,922
- Just relax. Let’s have a nice lunch.
- OK.

553
00:48:24,009 --> 00:48:25,669
Hi. What’s happening?

554
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:31,220
Oh, no. Mickey fart pants.
Who let him grow up?

555
00:48:31,307 --> 00:48:34,094
- Go away.
- What?

556
00:48:36,562 --> 00:48:39,812
- I’m sorry.
- No, don’t apologise.

557
00:48:39,899 --> 00:48:43,849
I love being with you.
I love the way you cut your hair.

558
00:48:43,945 --> 00:48:46,021
I love the way you sink houseboats.

559
00:48:46,113 --> 00:48:50,740
Look at him. He’s still talking about love.
I always said you should be a girl.

560
00:48:52,912 --> 00:48:59,080
You know, some people believe
that you really never ever fall out of love.

561
00:48:59,168 --> 00:49:04,209
Oh! This isn’t like when we were five.
We’re grown-ups now, so piss off.

562
00:49:04,298 --> 00:49:07,832
I’d like to know more about
the grown-up Mickey Bunce.

563
00:49:07,926 --> 00:49:09,966
OK, I...

564
00:49:10,846 --> 00:49:16,848
Well... I know how much you...
hate the word divorce

565
00:49:16,935 --> 00:49:21,063
but after mine I had to get back
into the whole dating...

566
00:49:24,275 --> 00:49:26,102
game.

567
00:49:32,367 --> 00:49:35,652
- Yes, Mickey, go on.
- Yes, Mickey, go on.

568
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:38,619
OK. Erm...

569
00:49:40,249 --> 00:49:42,538
See that woman over there?

570
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:45,878
Mm-hm.

571
00:49:47,631 --> 00:49:50,336
Well, I dated her three or four times.

572
00:49:50,426 --> 00:49:56,345
It was funny. I didn’t know whether I should
hold her hand when we walked down the street

573
00:49:56,432 --> 00:49:58,471
or give her a kiss good night.

574
00:49:59,852 --> 00:50:02,722
I felt like I was back in high school again.

575
00:50:07,651 --> 00:50:09,690
Why did you do that?

576
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:13,814
- I didn’t.
- No, you did. I saw you do that.

577
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,363
I did, didn’t I? To get the waiter’s attention.

578
00:50:20,455 --> 00:50:22,578
Well, I don’t think that works.

579
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:26,158
Maybe that does work.

580
00:50:26,252 --> 00:50:28,292
Your lunch.

581
00:50:29,088 --> 00:50:31,128
And your lunch, sir.

582
00:50:31,841 --> 00:50:33,964
This table leg must be loose again.

583
00:50:41,976 --> 00:50:43,600
Peekaboo.

584
00:50:44,478 --> 00:50:48,262
Peekaboo, yeah.
I play that with Natalie all the time.

585
00:50:53,195 --> 00:50:55,484
Oh, yeah...

586
00:50:55,572 --> 00:50:57,612
- Smells good.
- Mm!

587
00:51:11,379 --> 00:51:13,787
OK. Why did you do that?

588
00:51:13,882 --> 00:51:15,625
Disgusting!

589
00:51:15,717 --> 00:51:17,508
I’m crazy.

590
00:51:17,594 --> 00:51:21,128
You are crazy in the most wonderful way.

591
00:51:21,222 --> 00:51:26,014
God, I wish I could be like that.
I wish I could do those kind of things.

592
00:51:28,396 --> 00:51:30,435
What the hell.

593
00:51:33,734 --> 00:51:35,774
Hey, buddy.

594
00:51:39,782 --> 00:51:43,732
- Uh-oh!
- You don’t throw spaghetti in my restaurant.

595
00:51:43,828 --> 00:51:45,867
Fine. You do it.

596
00:51:47,206 --> 00:51:50,290
You and the Puttanesca woman, out of here.

597
00:51:50,376 --> 00:51:52,831
I like him a lot better than I used to.

598
00:51:53,712 --> 00:51:55,954
- Take it easy.
- You’re out of here.

599
00:51:56,048 --> 00:51:59,547
- It was a joke. You guys should loosen up.
- Out!

600
00:52:00,385 --> 00:52:02,627
- What is Puttanesca?
- My dress.

601
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:05,342
I’ll get it.
I’d like to. What the hell.

602
00:52:05,432 --> 00:52:07,839
Amigos.

603
00:52:07,934 --> 00:52:10,390
- Having fun?
- Come on, buddy.

604
00:52:11,855 --> 00:52:14,725
That was great.
That make you feel better?

605
00:52:14,816 --> 00:52:19,063
No. First you sink Janie’s houseboat.
What you did in that restaurant.

606
00:52:19,154 --> 00:52:22,404
- All you do is smash things up.
- What’s wrong with that?

607
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:25,028
Nothing, except you’re ruining my life.

608
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:31,616
Your problem is you’re no fun anymore.
You’ve turned into your mother.

609
00:52:31,707 --> 00:52:37,212
You are so sick. You know what?
I don’t want an imaginary friend any more.

610
00:52:37,296 --> 00:52:40,546
Do you see what you’re doing to me?
I’m talking to myself.

611
00:52:40,633 --> 00:52:44,761
You’re driving me crazy.
Please just get out of my life.

612
00:52:44,845 --> 00:52:50,800
All right, fine, I’m going and you’re never
going to see me again ever. Bye.

613
00:53:38,564 --> 00:53:40,603
I asked you nicely.

614
00:53:40,691 --> 00:53:42,731
Shh!

615
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,159
Somebody call security.

616
00:53:55,247 --> 00:53:57,286
I’m so sorry.

617
00:53:58,625 --> 00:54:00,285
I’m...

618
00:54:01,628 --> 00:54:06,337
You play such an expensive violin
in a shopping mall?

619
00:54:06,424 --> 00:54:08,251
Where? What?

620
00:54:08,343 --> 00:54:11,593
I’m just getting my bag. I’m fine, Mother.

621
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,463
How can you say that
when you have conversations with thin air?

622
00:54:15,558 --> 00:54:18,393
Not thin air, Drop Dead Fred.

623
00:54:18,478 --> 00:54:20,850
- Don’t mention his name.
- Sorry.

624
00:54:21,898 --> 00:54:25,646
You may have Drop Dead Fred.
I have Dr Ryland.

625
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:35,618
Elizabeth, please have a seat outside.
I need a word with your mother.

626
00:54:36,412 --> 00:54:39,697
That’s the piece, Matthew.
You’ve finished it.

627
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:56,007
I’m really sorry. I didn’t know I was going
to get you into so much trouble.

628
00:54:56,098 --> 00:55:00,475
So what did the doctor say?
Are you insane or what?

629
00:55:03,313 --> 00:55:05,352
Did they give you a lobotomy?

630
00:55:09,694 --> 00:55:11,734
He’s very good with children.

631
00:55:13,364 --> 00:55:14,989
Oh.

632
00:55:15,074 --> 00:55:21,444
He’s one of the country’s leading experts
in dealing with the imaginary-friend syndrome.

633
00:55:22,957 --> 00:55:25,578
Your child has one, too, huh?

634
00:55:25,668 --> 00:55:27,708
I don’t have a child.

635
00:55:27,795 --> 00:55:29,254
Oh?

636
00:55:29,338 --> 00:55:31,794
- Well, who’s in there?
- My mother.

637
00:55:31,882 --> 00:55:34,254
Oh!

638
00:55:34,343 --> 00:55:36,881
- Which one of you is...
- Me.

639
00:55:36,971 --> 00:55:39,640
- Let’s go.
- I’ll leave when I want to.

640
00:55:39,723 --> 00:55:41,467
OK, fine.

641
00:55:41,558 --> 00:55:44,643
OK, I was just asking.
Just trying to be nice.

642
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,821
Go to Hell Herman! Argh!

643
00:56:00,911 --> 00:56:03,698
Fred! Argh!

644
00:56:03,788 --> 00:56:06,077
Punch me.

645
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:07,576
Hey, hey!

646
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:09,873
Yaah!

647
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:12,534
Hey, Fred!

648
00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:15,667
- Velcro Head!
- Yaah!

649
00:56:15,758 --> 00:56:18,296
Brrrrrrr!

650
00:56:19,846 --> 00:56:21,423
What are you doing?

651
00:56:23,516 --> 00:56:25,555
I am playing with my friends.

652
00:56:28,813 --> 00:56:32,098
Hey, Freddy. Hi, guys!

653
00:56:32,191 --> 00:56:34,230
- Graggy.
- Hey, Fred, hold this.

654
00:56:38,781 --> 00:56:41,651
That’s so Namby Pamby.

655
00:56:41,742 --> 00:56:43,781
You called?

656
00:56:46,663 --> 00:56:48,703
Namby Pamby!

657
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,748
Whoo!

658
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:55,626
This is great. The whole gang’s here.
Let’s have a sick contest!

659
00:57:10,687 --> 00:57:14,933
Hey, watch this. Charge!

660
00:57:22,823 --> 00:57:25,279
Cuckoo! Cuckoo!

661
00:57:25,368 --> 00:57:26,992
Oooh!

662
00:57:27,078 --> 00:57:29,117
Very nice.

663
00:57:29,205 --> 00:57:33,202
Nine, maybe ten. I love it.

664
00:57:33,292 --> 00:57:35,331
- Not bad, huh?
- Beautiful.

665
00:57:37,629 --> 00:57:41,045
Let her take these after meals and before bed.

666
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:43,671
- Are there any side effects?
- None.

667
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,173
They just neutralise that part
of the brain which is malfunctioning.

668
00:57:48,265 --> 00:57:50,304
How did it come to this?

669
00:57:50,392 --> 00:57:53,393
She’s regressed to where these children are.

670
00:57:54,521 --> 00:57:56,560
Elizabeth.

671
00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:07,155
- Well, I’ve got to go, so I’ll see you chickens later.
- Fred. Not the pills.

672
00:58:07,242 --> 00:58:11,405
Why not? Do they make you sick or stupid?
I’ll take them. I’m Fred.

673
00:58:11,496 --> 00:58:14,532
You don’t want to
let her take the green ones.

674
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:17,328
- Why not?
- Remember Go-Go Mouth?

675
00:58:17,418 --> 00:58:19,458
Yeah.

676
00:58:29,513 --> 00:58:33,012
- Don’t worry about me.
- No, no, F...

677
00:58:47,197 --> 00:58:49,237
Here we are.

678
00:58:49,324 --> 00:58:53,701
Now, I want you to
eat all your vegetables.

679
00:58:53,787 --> 00:58:55,826
- Yes.
- Yes what?

680
00:58:56,665 --> 00:58:58,823
- Yes, thank you.
- That’s better.

681
00:58:59,793 --> 00:59:03,790
We’re going to be great friends, Mrs Cronin.
I can see that.

682
00:59:06,549 --> 00:59:08,589
I’ll be right back.

683
00:59:20,229 --> 00:59:25,769
Don’t eat the napkin, dear. I’ve got
a black belt and I could break you like that.

684
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:30,652
You’re going to behave.
Conscious or unconscious, it’s all the same to me.

685
00:59:31,782 --> 00:59:36,278
Whoo! I like her.
She is good. She is awfully good.

686
00:59:37,287 --> 00:59:39,529
I’ll be back in a moment with your pill.

687
00:59:39,623 --> 00:59:41,948
"I’ll be back in a moment with your pill. "

688
00:59:42,042 --> 00:59:47,831
Wait a minute. Those are the... pills. This is
getting serious. We’d better get out of here.

689
00:59:48,632 --> 00:59:53,424
- I know, but this will take one minute.
- There’s no way anyone can see her.

690
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:56,299
- I know, cos she’s so crazy.
- Yes, crazy.

691
00:59:56,389 --> 01:00:00,090
- Michael, take your foot out of my door.
- Oh...

692
01:00:09,819 --> 01:00:12,524
Come on. Snot face, let’s go.

693
01:00:13,656 --> 01:00:16,277
Look, I am getting fed up of this.

694
01:00:16,367 --> 01:00:21,159
It’s getting dangerous. There’s two
of them now and they’ve got pills.

695
01:00:21,247 --> 01:00:25,494
They’re going to turn you into one of them.
You’ve started already.

696
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:29,997
You picked up a piece of broccoli and went,
"What a lovely piece of broccoli. "

697
01:00:30,089 --> 01:00:32,627
I can’t believe it.
It’s beyond disgusting.

698
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:38,176
Snot face, please help.

699
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:47,059
Come on.

700
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:55,940
Look, remember when your dad picked up
the megabeast and threw her out the window?

701
01:00:56,030 --> 01:01:00,408
- That never happened.
- It didn’t happen, but you wanted it to.

702
01:01:01,578 --> 01:01:04,199
Yeah. So did I.

703
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,911
Do you remember? Hm?

704
01:01:09,752 --> 01:01:11,579
Remember?

705
01:01:13,464 --> 01:01:17,711
Elizabeth, you’ve made
a mess of your beautiful hair.

706
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:22,257
The time has come...

707
01:01:22,348 --> 01:01:27,175
when we don’t want to hear the words
Drop Dead Fred ever again.

708
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:29,936
Don’t you agree, Nigel?

709
01:01:31,356 --> 01:01:35,817
- Hm? About what?
- This Drop Dead Fred business.

710
01:01:41,575 --> 01:01:45,952
- I’m sorry, Pol.
- Stand still. I’ll clean it later.

711
01:01:47,038 --> 01:01:49,078
I have some cereal?

712
01:01:49,165 --> 01:01:51,407
May I have some cereal?

713
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:56,922
Yes, you may in just a minute.
We don’t eat food off the floor.

714
01:01:57,006 --> 01:02:01,715
- Why do you call him Drop Dead Fred?
- Because that’s his name, Daddy.

715
01:02:01,803 --> 01:02:05,670
And Drop Dead Fred
is going to teach me how to cook today.

716
01:02:05,765 --> 01:02:11,518
I’m going to need flour and sugar
and honey and vodka.

717
01:02:11,604 --> 01:02:15,304
And a pair of your pants.
We’re making pants pie.

718
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:17,439
Ouch!

719
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:21,061
Vodka and pants pie.
God knows what else.

720
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:24,028
She’s only a kid, Pol.

721
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:29,109
Daddy, how about we throw
Mommy out the window?

722
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:33,036
It won’t hurt her.
She’ll land right in the gladioli’s.

723
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:38,662
You shouldn’t say things like that
about your mother.

724
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,997
She might cut your head off.

725
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,715
Very funny, Elizabeth.

726
01:02:44,803 --> 01:02:48,337
Sometimes I think I don’t love you
as much as I used to.

727
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:52,761
- Drop Dead Fred does.
- No more Drop Dead Fred, period!

728
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:59,941
- Hi, Fred.
- You’re completely wrong cos I don’t love you.

729
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:04,652
I don’t love anyone cos love’s
for girls and girls are disgusting.

730
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:09,733
I’m a loner. I’m a crazy, wide-eyed loner
on a doomed space mission to Venus

731
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:12,614
to battle with the three-headed megabeast.

732
01:03:12,705 --> 01:03:16,537
But on the way there, I caught cornflakes disease.

733
01:03:29,012 --> 01:03:33,970
Pants pie can’t save me now.
The only thing that can save me is a mud pie.

734
01:03:34,059 --> 01:03:35,886
Yeah! Come on.

735
01:03:44,903 --> 01:03:47,145
Here it comes.

736
01:03:47,238 --> 01:03:49,278
- Take the top off.
- OK.

737
01:03:49,365 --> 01:03:52,699
- Here it comes.
- Wow, my first real mud pie!

738
01:03:52,785 --> 01:03:59,748
It’s not ready yet. We need lots of other things.
We need cornflakes and orange juice. Beautiful.

739
01:04:00,626 --> 01:04:03,497
- That’s lovely.
- This is fun.

740
01:04:04,589 --> 01:04:07,673
A little tea. A lot of tea.

741
01:04:08,676 --> 01:04:11,214
- Sugar?
- Yeah.

742
01:04:11,303 --> 01:04:13,545
- That’s good.
- Here.

743
01:04:13,639 --> 01:04:17,423
That’s good. There’s the milk. Good.
Lots of milk.

744
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:21,354
Lovely. Right.

745
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:27,766
Yeah, but it’s not ready.
It’s still too pretty. It needs something.

746
01:04:27,861 --> 01:04:29,901
I know.

747
01:04:37,496 --> 01:04:38,954
There.

748
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:44,625
Great. When something’s not working, the best
thing is to tear it apart to make it better.

749
01:04:44,711 --> 01:04:48,376
Elizabeth, are you behaving in there?

750
01:04:51,009 --> 01:04:54,093
- I’m not afraid of the megabeast.
- I’m not either.

751
01:04:54,178 --> 01:04:57,428
When she comes in here,
we’ll make her eat up this mud.

752
01:04:57,515 --> 01:05:00,765
- And then we’ll cut her head off.
- With scissors.

753
01:05:00,852 --> 01:05:04,552
- And then we’ll make her eat it.
- Make her eat her own head?

754
01:05:04,647 --> 01:05:08,514
- With what?
- Oh, yeah. Well, I’ll eat her head, then.

755
01:05:08,609 --> 01:05:12,654
- And I’ll eat the rest of her.
- Yeah! And then we’ll get up...

756
01:05:13,572 --> 01:05:18,779
And we’ll poo her all over the table
cos we’re not afraid of anything. Yeah!

757
01:05:18,869 --> 01:05:21,325
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

758
01:05:21,413 --> 01:05:22,528
Argh!

759
01:05:22,623 --> 01:05:25,493
- Elizabeth!
- Quick, hide.

760
01:05:25,584 --> 01:05:27,623
Quick.

761
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,581
Hurry up!

762
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:35,840
OK?

763
01:05:39,055 --> 01:05:40,882
Ah!

764
01:05:43,309 --> 01:05:45,101
Oh, my...

765
01:05:49,148 --> 01:05:51,556
What is wrong with you?

766
01:05:56,489 --> 01:05:59,443
You’ve been playing with him, haven’t you?

767
01:06:00,743 --> 01:06:02,783
Where is he?

768
01:06:06,123 --> 01:06:08,910
Don’t take him away from me!

769
01:06:09,001 --> 01:06:12,536
So that must make you cry.
Well, now I know what to do.

770
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:17,872
Give me it. No, don’t take him away from me.

771
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:25,131
- Nigel, do it.
- No, I won’t.

772
01:06:25,225 --> 01:06:30,432
- I don’t want anything to do with it. It’s not right.
- All right. I’ll do it.

773
01:06:39,656 --> 01:06:41,695
It’s not right.

774
01:06:41,783 --> 01:06:44,653
What would you know about raising a child?

775
01:06:51,918 --> 01:06:53,957
Apparently nothing.

776
01:06:57,965 --> 01:07:01,381
If you ever touch this again,
I’ll throw it in the trash.

777
01:07:01,469 --> 01:07:05,051
Do you know what will happen?
He will be crushed to death.

778
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:38,752
"Dear Drop Dead Fred,

779
01:07:38,838 --> 01:07:46,051
"you were my only friend
but she took you away from me.

780
01:07:48,848 --> 01:07:52,548
"I know I’ll see you again someday. "

781
01:07:55,730 --> 01:07:59,858
"If you come back,
I promise we’ll run away together. "

782
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:02,515
See that? "Promise. "

783
01:08:03,654 --> 01:08:06,738
I found that when I was
hiding in the garden shed.

784
01:08:06,824 --> 01:08:11,865
That’s right. That’s where I hid it.
But you never answered it.

785
01:08:13,997 --> 01:08:16,239
You just disappeared.

786
01:08:17,751 --> 01:08:22,212
And when you did all the... life

787
01:08:22,297 --> 01:08:25,215
and, um, the spirit...

788
01:08:25,884 --> 01:08:29,467
- and the...
- The Fred.

789
01:08:29,554 --> 01:08:34,015
Yeah, Fred. Just went out of me.

790
01:08:36,227 --> 01:08:40,688
I should never have let my mother know
how much she could hurt me.

791
01:08:42,317 --> 01:08:47,192
Once she knew how, she knew
that she could do it all the time.

792
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,107
And she did.

793
01:08:53,911 --> 01:08:56,947
So I never showed
her my real feelings again.

794
01:09:01,585 --> 01:09:04,372
- So?
- So?

795
01:09:04,463 --> 01:09:06,503
So now can we run away, please?

796
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,550
- Where to?
- To the party.

797
01:09:11,637 --> 01:09:14,673
- To the Charlie party.
- Yeah.

798
01:09:14,765 --> 01:09:16,176
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

799
01:09:16,266 --> 01:09:17,464
Yeah!

800
01:09:25,942 --> 01:09:27,567
OK?

801
01:09:27,652 --> 01:09:29,692
Let’s go.

802
01:09:30,405 --> 01:09:33,157
Oh, no, gladiolas.

803
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,608
No. No. No!

804
01:09:48,005 --> 01:09:50,496
Where do you think you’re going?

805
01:09:50,591 --> 01:09:52,002
I’m going.

806
01:09:52,093 --> 01:09:57,051
- No, you’re not, you’re staying.
- No, Mother, this time I’m definitely going.

807
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:07,979
Good night, flake.

808
01:10:10,736 --> 01:10:13,523
Yeah, well, we’re not scared of you, fatso.

809
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:19,278
Come on. We’ll go out the window.
I’m good at this. Stand back.

810
01:10:24,291 --> 01:10:26,330
Wait a minute.

811
01:10:29,879 --> 01:10:31,919
I love those breaking noises.

812
01:10:32,924 --> 01:10:35,166
Let’s go. Come on.

813
01:10:38,054 --> 01:10:40,510
Hey, door-to-window service.

814
01:10:41,182 --> 01:10:43,638
- I brought your dress, madam.
- Mickey.

815
01:10:45,061 --> 01:10:48,512
- Can you give me a lift?
- Absolutely. Come on.

816
01:10:48,606 --> 01:10:50,017
Oi, wait for me.

817
01:10:56,739 --> 01:10:59,989
- I believe you ordered the spaghetti.
- I hate you.

818
01:11:00,075 --> 01:11:03,776
Mickey, I’m so sorry.
I hope I didn’t get you into trouble.

819
01:11:03,871 --> 01:11:07,121
No. Look, it’s OK.
It’s all been great to me.

820
01:11:08,083 --> 01:11:13,078
You’re going to look beautiful in your dress.
I hope Charles appreciates it.

821
01:11:13,171 --> 01:11:16,042
He’s just a total and utter girl, isn’t he?

822
01:11:16,133 --> 01:11:19,252
This is great,
stuck in a truck with two girls.

823
01:11:32,148 --> 01:11:34,556
Mickey, you’re the best.

824
01:11:37,487 --> 01:11:41,021
- Thanks.
- I think I was six when we moved away.

825
01:11:41,115 --> 01:11:46,738
I remember getting in the car, pulling away,
taking one last look at you

826
01:11:46,829 --> 01:11:51,123
and thinking, "I’m never going
to get to have fun with Betsy again. "

827
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:52,833
Mickey Bunce.

828
01:11:53,878 --> 01:11:57,377
Don’t you hate it when you’re right
about the wrong things?

829
01:11:57,464 --> 01:12:00,668
- Let’s go.
- Thanks.

830
01:12:19,694 --> 01:12:22,944
- Snot face, you are looking great.
- I am?

831
01:12:23,031 --> 01:12:25,652
Yeah. For a girl.

832
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:38,625
There he is.

833
01:12:41,716 --> 01:12:44,420
- Is that him?
- Mm-hm.

834
01:12:48,014 --> 01:12:52,474
I thought he liked wine.
Why does he keep spitting it out?

835
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,430
- Where’s he gone?
- I don’t know. Come on.

836
01:12:55,521 --> 01:12:56,766
Right.

837
01:12:57,564 --> 01:13:01,479
- Fred, let’s just behave ourselves.
- Sure. Not a problem.

838
01:13:01,568 --> 01:13:03,395
Grapes.

839
01:13:04,488 --> 01:13:06,777
Could someone grab a hold of this?

840
01:13:09,743 --> 01:13:15,579
What? Why do I always get the blame? You’ve
got the grape. The lady with the grape did it.

841
01:13:22,964 --> 01:13:25,835
- Where is he?
- I don’t know.

842
01:13:25,925 --> 01:13:29,175
Don’t worry.
I’ll find Charlie boy for you.

843
01:13:29,262 --> 01:13:31,967
Wait here. Charlie!

844
01:13:33,599 --> 01:13:35,010
Charlie!

845
01:13:35,101 --> 01:13:36,429
Oha...

846
01:13:40,898 --> 01:13:42,807
No panties.

847
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,857
No panties! Ah!

848
01:13:44,944 --> 01:13:48,443
Get up. Get up.

849
01:13:50,241 --> 01:13:51,865
- Fred, get up.
- Go away!

850
01:13:51,951 --> 01:13:54,192
- Get up.
- Spoilsport.

851
01:13:57,915 --> 01:14:00,750
I was just admiring your dress.

852
01:14:00,834 --> 01:14:04,583
The material, it’s so pretty. Slinky.

853
01:14:05,505 --> 01:14:07,083
Oh!

854
01:14:07,174 --> 01:14:09,961
- It’s pretty neat.
- It looks good on you.

855
01:14:10,052 --> 01:14:14,001
It feels good on.
I like yours. Yours is nice.

856
01:14:14,848 --> 01:14:17,553
- It’s very purple.
- Annabelle.

857
01:14:17,642 --> 01:14:20,180
- My little Chardonnay.
- There you are.

858
01:14:22,313 --> 01:14:26,393
Elizabeth. My God.

859
01:14:27,151 --> 01:14:29,191
That’s him.

860
01:14:29,904 --> 01:14:34,531
Don't just stand there, do something.
Go on. Kiss him.

861
01:14:39,664 --> 01:14:41,703
You said she was mousey.

862
01:14:44,251 --> 01:14:46,956
I’m sorry. Excuse me.

863
01:14:47,046 --> 01:14:49,085
Don’t go. It’s going great.

864
01:14:54,178 --> 01:14:56,217
Are you OK?

865
01:14:57,139 --> 01:14:59,178
- I think so.
- Yeah?

866
01:14:59,266 --> 01:15:01,259
Yeah.

867
01:15:01,351 --> 01:15:05,894
- My little vermentino.
- My little Pinot Noir.

868
01:15:08,734 --> 01:15:13,609
I can’t believe we left the party so soon.
All that wine to spit around.

869
01:15:13,697 --> 01:15:17,860
- We didn’t even get to play spin the bottle.
- I got upset.

870
01:15:17,951 --> 01:15:22,577
God, you’re so stupid.
You never leave a party till the very end.

871
01:15:22,664 --> 01:15:26,115
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

872
01:15:26,209 --> 01:15:28,830
Cinderella left early. Remember her?

873
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:33,546
No, I don’t remember her. I forgot
everything about her. She made me puke.

874
01:15:33,633 --> 01:15:36,752
I remember the ugly sisters.
They were great.

875
01:15:39,472 --> 01:15:41,511
You’re here.

876
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:46,218
- I tell you something?
- What?

877
01:15:46,312 --> 01:15:49,562
You look fabulous.

878
01:15:50,941 --> 01:15:52,768
I do?

879
01:15:53,861 --> 01:15:56,102
Darling, you need me.

880
01:15:57,114 --> 01:15:59,153
I do?

881
01:16:00,325 --> 01:16:02,365
To protect you.

882
01:16:03,328 --> 01:16:05,368
From what?

883
01:16:06,832 --> 01:16:09,073
Men like me.

884
01:16:10,752 --> 01:16:14,880
- But, Charles, there’s so many things...
- No. No talk.

885
01:16:14,964 --> 01:16:17,004
Just kiss.

886
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:33,478
What was that?

887
01:16:33,566 --> 01:16:36,401
Oh, it’s Fred.

888
01:16:36,485 --> 01:16:40,400
Fred? What did you do,
give this Fred a key?

889
01:16:40,489 --> 01:16:45,484
Hey, Fred, I’m home now.
It’s Charles, Lizzie's husband.

890
01:16:49,498 --> 01:16:51,538
Is he the violent type?

891
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:54,033
Only with me.

892
01:16:54,128 --> 01:16:55,586
Jesus.

893
01:17:04,805 --> 01:17:09,348
Who does this guy think he is,
playing around with a married woman?

894
01:17:21,321 --> 01:17:23,147
Polly, hi.

895
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:25,279
What did you do?

896
01:17:26,492 --> 01:17:28,532
Hello?

897
01:17:29,203 --> 01:17:32,738
You are a wonderful man, Charles,
but she is dangerous.

898
01:17:32,832 --> 01:17:37,826
I love dangerous. Don’t worry.
I can take care of this Drop Dead Fred.

899
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,541
If you think you can handle it, here.

900
01:17:40,631 --> 01:17:45,174
- But, Charles, she is just a child.
- I’m a grown-up, Polly.

901
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:49,802
Where were we?

902
01:17:52,643 --> 01:17:55,098
Eurgh!
What does that taste like?

903
01:17:55,187 --> 01:17:58,638
Charles, let’s talk.
It’s kind of important to me.

904
01:17:58,732 --> 01:18:00,771
Of course it is.

905
01:18:04,321 --> 01:18:07,606
- You’re not going to get that out, are you?
- Not now.

906
01:18:07,699 --> 01:18:09,738
- Not now?
- No, I mean now.

907
01:18:09,826 --> 01:18:11,866
- Now.
- Now.

908
01:18:14,038 --> 01:18:15,865
Hang on.

909
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:21,960
Hang on. This isn’t how the pigeons do it. You’re
supposed to stamp on her head and peck her.

910
01:18:22,046 --> 01:18:25,213
- Charles.
- Annabelle.

911
01:18:25,299 --> 01:18:27,339
- What?
- What?

912
01:18:27,426 --> 01:18:29,964
What happened?

913
01:18:30,054 --> 01:18:32,462
You just said Annabelle.

914
01:18:32,556 --> 01:18:35,925
- No, I didn’t.
- Yes, you did. You said, "Oh, Annabelle. "

915
01:18:36,018 --> 01:18:39,683
- You said "Oh, Annabelle. "
- That’s impossible.

916
01:18:39,772 --> 01:18:43,022
Charles, I heard you. You said Annabelle.

917
01:18:43,108 --> 01:18:51,116
Well... if I said, "Oh, Annabelle," isn’t it better
that I said, "Oh, Annabelle" and I was here with you,

918
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:55,328
than to say "Oh, Lizzie" and be
somewhere else with Annabelle?

919
01:18:58,206 --> 01:19:00,033
Yeah.

920
01:19:03,003 --> 01:19:07,997
I know what you’re doing. You’re going to do
what he did to Annabelle on the sofa.

921
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:11,791
- Don’t say things like that now, Fred.
- Lizzie.

922
01:19:11,886 --> 01:19:19,099
I think it’s time to
say goodbye... to your friend.

923
01:19:21,229 --> 01:19:23,352
Hey. Hey!

924
01:19:24,482 --> 01:19:27,898
Listen, I’m Drop Dead Fred, right?

925
01:19:27,985 --> 01:19:34,355
If your husband thinks he can get rid of me with
a stupid pill, he’s got another think coming.

926
01:19:35,284 --> 01:19:37,111
Ow.

927
01:19:38,996 --> 01:19:41,701
Well, thank you very much,
dear friend.

928
01:19:45,794 --> 01:19:47,621
Charles.

929
01:19:48,505 --> 01:19:51,174
Oh, you look so handsome!

930
01:19:51,258 --> 01:19:55,635
- Lizzie, come on, now. Don’t do that.
- We have to do it this way.

931
01:19:55,721 --> 01:19:57,760
Look, I’ve got a long day.

932
01:19:58,849 --> 01:20:00,888
I don’t like him.

933
01:20:04,896 --> 01:20:06,972
No. It scares me.

934
01:20:08,108 --> 01:20:10,147
Go on. Out his throat.

935
01:20:11,694 --> 01:20:13,901
Go on.

936
01:20:20,411 --> 01:20:24,076
- What’s the news?
- Wait till my endorphins kick in.

937
01:20:24,165 --> 01:20:28,412
You know, the body’s natural morphine.
Here it comes.

938
01:20:28,502 --> 01:20:30,294
Ooh!

939
01:20:30,379 --> 01:20:33,997
- The aerobic rush. Now ask me.
- What’s the big news?

940
01:20:36,635 --> 01:20:40,929
Have you ever seen so many zeros
outside of the national debt?

941
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:46,683
- I never knew a barge was worth this much?
- Not a barge. A river condominium.

942
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:50,471
I had no idea they were worth
that much until mine sank.

943
01:20:50,565 --> 01:20:54,777
What a total groove. You’ve got Charles
back and I have all those zeros.

944
01:20:54,861 --> 01:20:58,230
Our lives have worked out!
Thank you, Drop Dead Fred.

945
01:20:58,323 --> 01:21:01,193
Don’t waste your breath.
I’m phasing him out.

946
01:21:01,284 --> 01:21:03,526
- Really?
- Yeah.

947
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:06,989
What’s for dinner?
Your favourite.

948
01:21:07,081 --> 01:21:09,703
Beef Wellington, how nice.

949
01:21:13,755 --> 01:21:17,005
- To us.
- To... us.

950
01:21:22,805 --> 01:21:24,845
For you, my love.

951
01:21:31,772 --> 01:21:34,393
What the hell is that?

952
01:21:36,443 --> 01:21:39,693
- Mud pie.
- Is that supposed to be a joke?

953
01:21:39,780 --> 01:21:44,027
- Fred!
- It’s either him or me, Elizabeth.

954
01:21:44,117 --> 01:21:49,906
It’s you. I swear. Fred is gone.
You know what? I’ll make a dinner salad.

955
01:21:49,998 --> 01:21:53,248
- Forget it.
- I’ll make a lovely salad. Please.

956
01:21:53,335 --> 01:21:59,005
It’ll be the most romantic, wonderful,
romantic... romantic salad.

957
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:02,293
- A romantic dinner salad.
- Yeah. OK?

958
01:22:02,385 --> 01:22:04,841
- OK.
- Here I go. I’m making it.

959
01:22:07,056 --> 01:22:12,726
It’s going to be so good. If you leave those pants,
I’ll take them to the dry cleaners tomorrow.

960
01:22:12,812 --> 01:22:15,054
You’ll never hear from Fred again.

961
01:22:21,821 --> 01:22:25,237
- He’s the wrong man for you.
- I don’t want to hear it.

962
01:22:25,324 --> 01:22:27,364
You’re not happy.

963
01:22:28,536 --> 01:22:33,778
- Yes, I am.
- If you’re so happy, why am I still here?

964
01:22:35,292 --> 01:22:37,332
I can fix that.

965
01:22:38,128 --> 01:22:40,833
No, don’t do that.
Please don’t do that.

966
01:22:56,980 --> 01:22:59,601
Darling...

967
01:22:59,691 --> 01:23:02,857
Of course I still love you, Annabelle.

968
01:23:02,944 --> 01:23:06,942
Hey, I’m your fella, Annabelle.

969
01:23:07,031 --> 01:23:09,071
Yeah.

970
01:23:09,158 --> 01:23:11,317
Snot face, come here.

971
01:23:12,036 --> 01:23:16,663
- I don’t hear you.
- It’s important. He’s worse than the megabeast.

972
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:21,582
- That’s it. I’m taking the last pill.
- No.

973
01:23:21,671 --> 01:23:24,458
- The goodbye pill.
- Don’t do that.

974
01:23:28,219 --> 01:23:30,544
Just look in there. Please.

975
01:23:35,059 --> 01:23:38,262
Annabelle... Annabelle, she’ll never know.

976
01:23:39,396 --> 01:23:41,436
And so what if she does?

977
01:23:42,566 --> 01:23:47,808
No, listen. Would you listen?
I am in control with Lizzie.

978
01:23:47,904 --> 01:23:50,312
I’m in the driver’s seat.

979
01:23:50,407 --> 01:23:52,446
She trusts me.

980
01:23:55,203 --> 01:23:57,243
You’ve got to leave him.

981
01:23:58,206 --> 01:24:00,033
I don’t feel so good.

982
01:24:00,792 --> 01:24:02,416
Leave him.

983
01:24:03,962 --> 01:24:06,001
I can’t.

984
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:09,417
I’m scared to be alone.

985
01:24:11,886 --> 01:24:13,925
Come with me.

986
01:24:32,948 --> 01:24:36,068
- "Fred?"
- "Yeah. "

987
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:39,991
- "Where are we going?"
- "Use your imagination. "

988
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:45,411
- "Fred?"
- "You’ll know what to do. "

989
01:24:47,712 --> 01:24:49,752
"Fred?"

990
01:25:12,945 --> 01:25:15,353
I’m scared.

991
01:25:15,448 --> 01:25:17,689
I don’t want to be alone here.

992
01:25:53,234 --> 01:25:57,279
Get in, Lizzie.
I want to take you away, goose.

993
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,566
Don’t you love me anymore?

994
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:08,367
- Hi.
- Fred.

995
01:26:12,378 --> 01:26:14,833
So what are you going to do about him?

996
01:26:33,565 --> 01:26:36,601
Nice job.
Nice job.

997
01:26:36,693 --> 01:26:40,607
Couldn’t have done better myself.
Come on. This way.

998
01:26:42,407 --> 01:26:43,985
Ow!

999
01:26:49,956 --> 01:26:51,996
We need a tree.

1000
01:27:21,946 --> 01:27:25,196
You’re getting good at this. Let’s go.

1001
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:44,419
Just where do you think you’re going?

1002
01:27:45,302 --> 01:27:48,172
Just forget her.
Just say the magic words.

1003
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:53,215
- I’m not afraid of you.
- You can’t go in there.

1004
01:27:53,893 --> 01:27:56,052
I’m not afraid of you!

1005
01:27:56,145 --> 01:27:58,019
Finally, the magic words.

1006
01:28:43,483 --> 01:28:45,855
We don’t have to be afraid any more.

1007
01:29:01,667 --> 01:29:04,123
You have to go now.

1008
01:29:12,887 --> 01:29:15,971
OK. I’m ready.

1009
01:29:18,017 --> 01:29:20,258
- Let’s go.
- No.

1010
01:29:22,604 --> 01:29:25,391
You have to go alone.

1011
01:29:25,482 --> 01:29:29,396
- But I want you to come back with me.
- That’s just tough.

1012
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:34,021
You have to go alone. I can’t get back now.

1013
01:29:37,118 --> 01:29:39,158
Look, you’ve got you now.

1014
01:29:40,205 --> 01:29:43,455
You don’t need me. Not anymore.

1015
01:29:45,376 --> 01:29:48,128
So...

1016
01:29:48,213 --> 01:29:50,039
goodbye.

1017
01:29:56,387 --> 01:29:59,637
Just kiss me and say Drop Dead Fred.

1018
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:04,349
Now.

1019
01:30:05,479 --> 01:30:07,519
Drop Dead Fred.

1020
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:12,167
What do you mean it’s no good
for you this way? Annabelle, wait.

1021
01:31:14,755 --> 01:31:17,127
Well, to hell with you, Annabelle.

1022
01:31:21,303 --> 01:31:25,347
Lizzie, is our romantic salad ready?

1023
01:31:25,432 --> 01:31:27,555
Yeah.

1024
01:31:38,153 --> 01:31:40,192
Bye, Charles.

1025
01:31:40,280 --> 01:31:42,106
Oh!

1026
01:31:42,198 --> 01:31:44,321
I forgot to give you something.

1027
01:32:28,577 --> 01:32:31,910
Yes, Charles.
Leave everything to me. It’s Charles.

1028
01:32:31,997 --> 01:32:33,621
Charles?

1029
01:32:36,584 --> 01:32:39,704
Young lady,
you have a lot of explaining to do.

1030
01:32:39,796 --> 01:32:45,252
I know what’s best for me. You have
to stop treating me like I’m your enemy.

1031
01:32:45,343 --> 01:32:49,127
Enemy? Sometimes I wonder with you.

1032
01:32:49,222 --> 01:32:51,629
I made the same mistake
a lot of people make.

1033
01:32:51,724 --> 01:32:55,342
- I had a child to save a marriage.
- How can you say that?

1034
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:58,105
You made things worse.
He left because of you.

1035
01:33:00,316 --> 01:33:02,143
What a pile of shit.

1036
01:33:04,153 --> 01:33:09,395
Don’t you dare.
Don’t you dare walk out on me.

1037
01:33:10,325 --> 01:33:13,161
Elizabeth. Lizzie.

1038
01:33:14,288 --> 01:33:16,327
I’ll be lonely.

1039
01:33:46,819 --> 01:33:49,108
You should get yourself a friend.

1040
01:34:05,796 --> 01:34:08,750
You have a lot of options
open to you right now.

1041
01:34:08,841 --> 01:34:12,007
I just think I’d like
to be one of them. OK?

1042
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:17,379
- OK.
- Daddy, it was his idea.

1043
01:34:17,474 --> 01:34:21,472
I wanted to play but he bumped me
on the head and said piss off.

1044
01:34:21,561 --> 01:34:25,606
- Natalie, what did you do?
- Natalie Bunce, where are you?

1045
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:28,940
Come back in here this minute
and get cleaned up.

1046
01:34:29,027 --> 01:34:31,066
Natalie, what happened here?

1047
01:34:31,154 --> 01:34:35,531
- It’s chocolate and it’s yummy. Want some?
- No, I don’t want any.

1048
01:34:35,617 --> 01:34:41,406
She made a terrible mess in the kitchen and
expects me to believe a pretend friend did it.

1049
01:34:41,497 --> 01:34:45,115
He’s not pretend.
He’s Drop Dead Fred.

1050
01:34:47,712 --> 01:34:49,751
What did you say?

1051
01:34:49,839 --> 01:34:53,255
She said I’m not pretend.
What are you, deaf?

1052
01:34:53,342 --> 01:34:56,592
Natalie, now, come on.
What really happened?

1053
01:34:56,679 --> 01:34:59,929
I told you.
Don’t you believe me?

1054
01:35:00,015 --> 01:35:05,602
I believe you. Next time you see
Drop Dead Fred, you send him my love.

1055
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:08,021
Mr Bunce.

1056
01:35:08,107 --> 01:35:11,807
Look out. It’s the witch.
Come on. Quick.

1057
01:35:12,986 --> 01:35:17,778
This is it. I’m afraid you’re going
to have to find a new baby-sitter.

1058
01:35:17,866 --> 01:35:19,905
She’s just too much.

1059
01:35:20,827 --> 01:35:22,701
OK. Now.

1060
01:35:28,668 --> 01:35:31,503
Help! Help!

1061
01:35:32,547 --> 01:35:35,252
We did it.
I told you it would work. Brilliant.

1062
01:35:37,385 --> 01:35:40,635
Help! Help! Help!

1063
01:35:42,932 --> 01:35:44,723
Well done.
