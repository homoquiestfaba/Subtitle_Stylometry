Captain, you have to give me back
my shielding put on this case.

79
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:03,287
Big deal.

82
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:11,171
Relax, Carter. LAPD won't be
leading this investigation.

83
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:13,206

You know what?
We can't fight no army, Lee.

Never know what it feels like
to kill for no reason.

716
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:39,616
George, it's okay.

717
01:00:39,616 --> 01:00:41,384
Thank you.

718
01:00:41,384 --> 01:00:43,944
And good luck.

719
01:00:57,467 --> 01:00:59,867
What happened?

720
01:01:01,237 --> 01:01:04,107
That list. This is incredible.

721
01:01:04,107 --> 01:01:05,942
Some people said it was a myth.

722
01:01:05,942 --> 01:01:10,174
No, it's no myth. l've seen it.
Kiss it. But l didn't french kiss it.

723
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,382
You do understand how dangerous this is.

724
01:01:12,382 --> 01:01:14,017
l could always use some protection.

725
01:01:14,017 --> 01:01:15,352
Can we go to the police?

726
01:01:15,352 --> 01:01:18,455
l tried talk to many of them.

727
01:01:18,455 --> 01:01:20,446
We have to go through out of the country.

728
01:01:21,624 --> 01:01:23,126
Now my dear.

729
01:01:23,126 --> 01:01:25,428
Would you mind taking off that wig.

730
01:01:25,428 --> 01:01:27,364
Showing us Shosha.

731
01:01:27,364 --> 01:01:29,161
We never told him she was the list.

732
01:01:34,637 --> 01:01:36,539
Look at that.

733
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:40,343
13 names of things
to centres of tradition.

734
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:43,574
The only real proof
that the secret world exists.

735
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:55,047
Take their guns.

736
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,603
l told you he was bad, didn't l tell you?

737
01:02:06,603 --> 01:02:10,240
While l was thinking it,
the explosion at the embassy.

738
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,941
As head of the world criminal court,

739
01:02:11,941 --> 01:02:14,044
it would make sense for me
to be a target.

740
01:02:14,044 --> 01:02:16,012
Why did you come to my room?

741
01:02:16,012 --> 01:02:17,914
Geneviere was going to be killed.

742
01:02:17,914 --> 01:02:21,351
Having you die in the crossfire
would put an end to the investigation.

743
01:02:21,351 --> 01:02:25,219
Now, it will end another value.

744
01:02:26,222 --> 01:02:27,957
lt's over, Reynard.

745
01:02:27,957 --> 01:02:30,260
You know what it's like
to be an old man in prison?

746
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,594
They call you pops.

747
01:02:31,594 --> 01:02:33,363
They make you work in the library.

748
01:02:33,363 --> 01:02:36,059
Your best friend,
gonna be a mouse.

749
01:02:38,368 --> 01:02:40,737
l'm not falling into prison.

750
01:02:40,737 --> 01:02:43,297
You have a phonecall, inspector.

751
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:51,314
Hello, brother.

752
01:02:51,314 --> 01:02:53,416
l'd like to make a trade.

753
01:02:53,416 --> 01:02:56,619
Some friends of mine came across
something in the Los Angeles.

754
01:02:56,619 --> 01:02:59,520
Something very valuable.

755
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,392
Lee.

756
01:03:02,392 --> 01:03:04,360
Help me please.

757
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:08,965
Do we understand each other?

758
01:03:08,965 --> 01:03:09,966
What do you want?

759
01:03:09,966 --> 01:03:12,068
Shashon.

760
01:03:12,068 --> 01:03:15,003
You and Geneviere
will make me a long pride.

761
01:03:15,238 --> 01:03:17,574
lf l see you're with any other cops,

762
01:03:17,574 --> 01:03:19,375
the girl dies.

763
01:03:19,375 --> 01:03:21,244
Where?

764
01:03:21,244 --> 01:03:23,179
Jules Vaugh Restaurant.

765
01:03:23,179 --> 01:03:24,578
Midnight.

766
01:03:25,548 --> 01:03:27,243
Don't be late.

767
01:04:00,717 --> 01:04:02,947
He brought the girl.
Send the elevator down.

768
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:38,313
Welcome to the party, Lee.

769
01:04:39,789 --> 01:04:42,358
Tonight we celebrate the return
of Shashon...

770
01:04:42,358 --> 01:04:45,361
and the return of my brother.

771
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:47,795
Where is Soo Yung.

772
01:05:03,947 --> 01:05:05,782
This sword has a past.

773
01:05:05,782 --> 01:05:09,582
Unlike our world, it has seen
much pain, much blood.

774
01:05:13,189 --> 01:05:16,726
Hundreds of years ago, the Triads will
kill their enemies...

775
01:05:16,726 --> 01:05:19,262
with 100 cuts to the body.

776
01:05:19,262 --> 01:05:23,289
They would be very careful to avoid
any major arteries...

777
01:05:23,499 --> 01:05:27,503
so that the victim would stay alive
for as long as possible.

778
01:05:27,503 --> 01:05:30,961
You have just experience
to your first cut.

779
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:35,276
lf anything happens to Soo Yung...

780
01:05:36,045 --> 01:05:38,348
You can never kill me, Lee.

781
01:05:38,348 --> 01:05:39,882
We both know that.

782
01:05:39,882 --> 01:05:41,784
You know nothing about me.

783
01:05:41,784 --> 01:05:45,686
l know you have no wife.
No children. No family.

784
01:05:46,589 --> 01:05:50,650
You life ended when you were a kid
back in Chenjo.

785
01:05:55,431 --> 01:05:59,458
You have nothing... just like me.

786
01:05:59,636 --> 01:06:02,935
l won't say nothing.

787
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:08,139
He has me.

788
01:06:08,478 --> 01:06:11,242
His brother from another mother.

789
01:06:16,019 --> 01:06:18,419
Where is she?

790
01:06:18,621 --> 01:06:20,782
And join the few.

791
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,720
Soo Yung.

792
01:06:28,498 --> 01:06:30,693
Help me.

793
01:06:32,302 --> 01:06:33,536
Let her go.

794
01:06:33,536 --> 01:06:35,305
What the hell is wrong with you?

795
01:06:35,305 --> 01:06:37,006
Do you wanna die, Kenji?

796
01:06:37,006 --> 01:06:38,906
Get her outtajere

797
01:06:39,275 --> 01:06:41,277
Carter, drop the gun

798
01:06:41,277 --> 01:06:43,713
Get off that damn robber,
you end that temptations

799
01:06:43,713 --> 01:06:46,375
Rite now!

800
01:06:52,288 --> 01:06:55,348
Put her down, i'm serious

801
01:06:56,826 --> 01:06:58,851
l'm not playing

802
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:03,032
Kenji
-Drop the gun. -No!

803
01:07:03,032 --> 01:07:05,432
Drop it, Carter!

804
01:07:06,235 --> 01:07:08,965
Shit

805
01:07:23,052 --> 01:07:25,179
Get off of me!

806
01:07:26,923 --> 01:07:29,221
l'm gonna kick his ass, Kenji

807
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:53,348
He might be your brother,
but turn out to your sister

808
01:08:45,435 --> 01:08:47,699
Hold on, i'm coming!

809
01:09:14,897 --> 01:09:16,888
Lee!

810
01:10:46,289 --> 01:10:48,120
Enough, Kenji!

811
01:11:23,726 --> 01:11:26,194
Everybody comes for party

812
01:11:44,313 --> 01:11:47,111
What are you waiting for? do it!

813
01:11:59,929 --> 01:12:05,162
We're both gonna die
-No, l can save you

814
01:12:14,844 --> 01:12:17,540
Good bye, Lee
-No, Kenji

815
01:12:21,684 --> 01:12:23,675
No!

816
01:12:53,315 --> 01:12:55,112

817
01:13:00,523 --> 01:13:02,081

Stay cool lady

820
01:13:12,768 --> 01:13:14,531

01:13:18,107 --> 01:13:20,743
Don't you do it

823
01:13:20,743 --> 01:13:22,802
Think about what you're doing?

824
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:27,411
Hey

825
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:30,175
