00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:09,452
- You ain't gotta cook no more
because I got to go get
my cousin from jail.

254
00:10:09,452 --> 00:10:11,971
And it's probably gonna take

00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:13,454
'Cause he keep calling my phone, forgot.

256

257
00:10:14,287 --> 00:10:16,837
And why can't you just have
someone else pick him up?

258
00:10:16,837 --> 00:10:19,377
I wanted to make some
good ass breakfast for us.

259
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:20,702

260
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:21,593
he would've came and got me.

261
00:10:21,593 --> 00:10:22,806
So I'm gonna go get him,

262
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:23,737

263
00:10:23,737 --> 00:10:24,688
You cook dinner.

272
00:10:37,636 --> 00:10:38,662
- I was gonna make myself

a nigga had to go out here,

387
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,305

He'll drop the number a little
bit and thrown us something.

I got a proposition for both of us now.

00:17:26,307 --> 00:17:28,204
And I think it's a good
money making opportunity.

440
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:29,152
- What's your proposition, Jay?

441
00:17:29,152 --> 00:17:30,808
You know, I'm always here to hear it.

In the zoo, I got it locked down and shit.

446
00:17:38,185 --> 00:17:39,817
Well, I bumped into one of my old guys,

447
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:41,417
who was up in the Detroit area.

448
00:17:41,417 --> 00:17:43,314
And I know you said you was looking

449
00:17:43,314 --> 00:17:45,258
for something out there
in the Detroit area.

450
00:17:45,258 --> 00:17:46,363
I love money, Jay.

451
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:48,100
You know, talk to me, man.

452
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,394

453
00:17:49,394 --> 00:17:51,481
So my guy, he move like me.

454
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:54,146
He said he got a good number,

455
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:55,382
but I don't think he could beat you.

456
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:58,351
'Cause I see how you move
and I see how you work.

457
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:00,102
But this guy, he move like me and shit.

458
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:01,545
It'd be beneficial and shit.

00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:03,217
Cause he said-

460
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:05,602
- You really think we should
expand this Jay right now?

461
00:18:05,602 --> 00:18:06,594
- What you think?

462
00:18:06,594 --> 00:18:07,427
- It's a good cause.

463
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:08,260
- Is he a stand up dude?

464
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,093
Do you know this guy like that?

465
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:10,759
- Yeah man.
- You fuck with him.

466
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:11,966
He was my guy hitting them off to me

467
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,168
before I started fucking with you.

468
00:18:14,168 --> 00:18:15,476
If it wasn't for him,
you know what I'm saying?

469
00:18:15,476 --> 00:18:16,567
I wouldn't have got in the limelight

470
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:19,226

00:28:09,124 --> 00:28:10,728
- The one and only Keisha.

815
00:28:10,728 --> 00:28:11,826
- First of all, Keisha can't spell

816
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:13,010
so I can read none of her letters.

817
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,848

I need something to drink.

821
00:28:19,547 --> 00:28:20,380
- That's not my problem.

822
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,932
She was there for you
when you was writing her.

823
00:28:21,932 --> 00:28:22,977
You wasn't writing me.

824
00:28:22,977 --> 00:28:23,810
So-

825
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,646
- 'Cause I didn't have enough commissary.

826
00:28:24,646 --> 00:28:25,479
You didn't write me either.

827
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:26,813
You ain't put nothing on my books.

828
00:28:26,813 --> 00:28:28,616
- Because I heard about Keisha.

829
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:30,681
- I heard about your little
play that you got going on too.

830
00:28:30,681 --> 00:28:31,514
- Don't worry about me.

831
00:28:31,514 --> 00:28:32,347
- Damn!

832
00:28:32,347 --> 00:28:34,152
Can I get some lemonade or something?

00:28:34,152 --> 00:28:36,580
I know you've got something to drink.
You always got something to drink.

834
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,736
- Cliff, you always do this.

00:28:37,736 --> 00:28:38,569
- Do what?

836
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:40,282
- You've done this before
you even was locked down.

837
00:28:40,282 --> 00:28:42,283
- Babe, baby I'm sorry.

838

00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,816
- Oh my God.

844
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,748
Come on girl.

I know you got some Kool-Aid
in there or something.

846
00:28:53,811 --> 00:28:55,083
Damn!

847
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:55,916

00:42:08,154 --> 00:42:09,170
- Shit, I got one gray hair

1237
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,086
for everyday I did in that bitch.

1238
00:42:10,086 --> 00:42:11,157
You ain't write me either.

1239
00:42:11,157 --> 00:42:12,373
We'll get to that later.

1240
00:42:12,373 --> 00:42:13,206
We'll get to that later, Keisha.

1241
00:42:13,206 --> 00:42:14,553
- Oh my goodness, just come on.

1242
00:42:14,553 --> 00:42:16,390
- Stop, you all right?

1243
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,807
- This is amazing.
- You've been drinking?

1244
00:42:20,693 --> 00:42:21,789
- What?
- I'm just saying.

1245
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:22,622
I got something to drink.

1246
00:42:22,622 --> 00:42:25,057
- But I could have, use a drink like-

1247
00:42:25,057 --> 00:42:27,191
- I got some shit over
here for us, come on.

1248
00:42:27,191 --> 00:42:29,790
This my custom-made couch
the shit just got shipped.

1249
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:30,721
So just be careful.

1250
00:42:30,721 --> 00:42:33,092
You can you sit right here.

1251
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:37,762
- Why do we have plastic
cups in this big old mansion?

1252
00:42:37,762 --> 00:42:39,978
- The dishwasher broke,
don't even worry about that.

1253
00:42:39,978 --> 00:42:41,362
We'll be all right.
- Oh, okay.

1254
00:42:41,362 --> 00:42:42,195
- You ain't too good for plastic.

1255
00:42:42,195 --> 00:42:43,393
You all right baby.

1256
00:42:43,393 --> 00:42:45,386
- Anyway, it is so good to see you.

1257
00:42:45,386 --> 00:42:46,219
- You too.

1258
00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:47,832
You're so damn fine.

1259
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:48,665
- Thank you.

1260
00:42:48,665 --> 00:42:49,899
- What you've been up to?

1261
00:42:49,899 --> 00:42:52,372
- I'm just getting my business together,

1262
00:42:52,372 --> 00:42:55,151
you know, catering Kia's Kitchen.

1263
00:42:55,151 --> 00:42:57,821
- Okay, so you cooking, you hot.

1264
00:42:57,821 --> 00:43:00,523
- You hot too.
- Is that so?

1265
00:43:00,523 --> 00:43:02,186
- Mm hmm, you're hot too baby.

1266
00:43:02,186 --> 00:43:03,343
- You know, I got the artwork.

1267
00:43:03,343 --> 00:43:05,023
I just got that from Zimbabwe.

1268
00:43:05,023 --> 00:43:06,190
I killed like three lions.

1269
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,907
They gave me that she as a trophy.

1270
00:43:10,973 --> 00:43:12,798
When did you go to Africa

1271
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:13,631
if you just got out of jail.

1272
00:43:13,631 --> 00:43:14,464
- Oh, no.

1273
00:43:14,464 --> 00:43:15,548
See, they did this prison project,

1274
00:43:15,548 --> 00:43:17,492
where they sent some of
the prisoners to Africa.

1275
00:43:17,492 --> 00:43:19,295
that's like some test dummies and shit.

1276
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:20,948
So we had to like kill
them niggas in the wild.

1277
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:21,781
- Oh my God.

1278
00:43:21,781 --> 00:43:22,614
- Don't worry about all that.

1279
00:43:22,614 --> 00:43:23,447
Yeah, that's from Zimbabwe.

1280
00:43:23,447 --> 00:43:25,096
- That is risky.

1281
00:43:25,096 --> 00:43:27,382
Like did you have to sign off for that?

1282
00:43:27,382 --> 00:43:28,826
- No, they didn't care if we died.

1283
00:43:28,826 --> 00:43:29,659
That's what I'm saying.

1284
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:30,492
They just threw us out there.

1285
00:43:30,492 --> 00:43:31,750
We had to do what we had to do.

1286
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:34,917
- I'm so happy that you are all right,

1287
00:43:35,766 --> 00:43:37,167
and you are doing your thing.

1288
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:38,365
- I'm doing my thing, baby.

1289
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,427
I'm doing my thing.

1290
00:43:39,427 --> 00:43:40,447
- Yes.

1291
00:43:40,447 --> 00:43:42,599
- But, let me pour us a drink real quick.

1292
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:43,432
I'm sorry.

1293
00:43:43,432 --> 00:43:45,917
- Do you have any juice?

1294
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:47,800
- No, we ain't have no juice in prison.

1295
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,403
We gonna drink this straight.

1296
00:43:49,403 --> 00:43:50,888
Come on, Keisha don't do like that.

1297
00:43:50,888 --> 00:43:51,721
- You've ain't never been in Hollywood.

1298
00:43:51,721 --> 00:43:52,554
- Boy, now you know.

1299
00:43:52,554 --> 00:43:53,940
- You ain't never been in
Hollywood, come on girl.

1300
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,721
You know, how we used to do this.

1301
00:43:55,721 --> 00:43:56,615
You know how we used to do this shit.

1302
00:43:56,615 --> 00:43:57,448
- Give me a break.

1303
00:43:57,448 --> 00:43:58,281
- We had Kool-Aid or something.

1304
00:43:58,281 --> 00:43:59,114
You better go get some red,

1305
00:43:59,114 --> 00:44:02,117
or some purple, some grape something.

1306
00:44:02,117 --> 00:44:04,542
- Kool Aid, you ain't
gonna toast, come on.

1307
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:05,933
- I was just about to say that.

1308
00:44:05,933 --> 00:44:06,766
My bad.

1309
00:44:06,766 --> 00:44:08,450
I need to be all the woman you need.

1310
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,754
I am so sorry.

1311
00:44:09,754 --> 00:44:11,099
Big mansion like this?

1312
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:13,801
- Hell yeah.
I'll toast, put butter on
the bread, everything baby.

1313
00:44:13,801 --> 00:44:15,978
- So listen, this is to
this mansion and to tonight.

1314
00:44:15,978 --> 00:44:16,811
- Yes.

1315
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:23,678
Anyways, show me around.

1316
00:44:23,678 --> 00:44:25,063
- Okay, you want to see some shit?

1317
00:44:25,063 --> 00:44:29,563
- Yes. I'd love to see where
I'm a possibly be living.

1318
00:44:31,605 --> 00:44:34,430
So, I don't wanna be there.

1319
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:38,100
- Hold on, where we going?
- To my room.

1320
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,602
- Cool.
Hold on, what we going to your room for?

1321
00:44:41,602 --> 00:44:42,735
You were supposed to
be showing me the pool.

1322
00:44:42,735 --> 00:44:44,419
- You wanna see the pool?

1323
00:44:44,419 --> 00:44:46,553
- And the top floor.

1324
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:47,602
- I'm a show you that after that-

1325
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:48,660
- I told you I like watching HDTV.

1326
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,489
- I got all that in my room.

1327
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:51,422
I got all that shit.

1328
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:53,040
I got flat screens on all walls.

1329
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,457
- Do not be on this bull crap.

1330
00:44:54,457 --> 00:44:56,271
- Well, come on, let's go to the room.

1331
00:44:56,271 --> 00:44:57,738
Come on girl, come on.

1332
00:44:57,738 --> 00:44:59,887
- I guess.
- Let's do it.

1333
00:44:59,887 --> 00:45:01,555
- You need to find some juice.

1334
00:45:01,555 --> 00:45:03,659
- I think I got some here in the room.

1335
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,141
Don't touch that refrigerator
when we get in there.

1336
00:45:05,141 --> 00:45:07,170
That shit, that shit cost.

1337
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:09,252
- Why would you refrigerator cost?

1338
00:45:09,252 --> 00:45:10,677
Don't worry about it.

1339
00:45:10,677 --> 00:45:11,766
Damn Keisha!

1340
00:45:11,766 --> 00:45:13,627
Did I give you my key?

1341
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,698
- No, why did you have
your door locked anyway?

1342
00:45:15,698 --> 00:45:18,143
- People can't see that's confidential.

1343
00:45:18,143 --> 00:45:19,698
It's only for the best.

1344
00:45:19,698 --> 00:45:21,532
Damn I gotta go back to
the car and get my key.

1345
00:45:21,532 --> 00:45:23,086
You wanna walk back to the car room?

1346
00:45:23,086 --> 00:45:24,817
- Well, I guess so.

1347
00:45:24,817 --> 00:45:25,650
You know what-

1348
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:29,409
- You wanna stay here.
- I'll stay here, go ahead.

1349
00:45:29,409 --> 00:45:31,747
- I'll be right back baby.

1350
00:45:31,747 --> 00:45:33,699
I wanted to look at you one more time.

1351
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:34,532
Damn!

1352
00:45:41,264 --> 00:45:42,167
- Thanks so much.

1353
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:43,471
- So how does this work?

1354
00:45:43,471 --> 00:45:44,561
- They will contact you...

1355
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:47,000
They should contact you by tomorrow.

1356
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,321
I'm putting it in today.

1357
00:45:48,321 --> 00:45:50,398
- Okay, all right.

1358
00:45:50,398 --> 00:45:51,481
- All right.

1359
00:45:53,825 --> 00:45:55,854
- Anyways, you seen Cliff?

1360
00:45:55,854 --> 00:45:58,617
- Could you hold one second for me?

1361
00:45:58,617 --> 00:46:00,118
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

1362
00:46:00,118 --> 00:46:02,181
- Fine, you Cliff cousin?

1363
00:46:02,181 --> 00:46:03,019
- Who?
- Cliff.

1364
00:46:03,019 --> 00:46:04,269
- Who's Cliff?

1365
00:46:05,357 --> 00:46:07,438
- The person who own this mansion.

1366
00:46:07,438 --> 00:46:08,521
- This hotel?

1367
00:46:09,507 --> 00:46:10,598
- I knew this.

1368
00:46:10,598 --> 00:46:13,400
That's why he got locked
up the first time.

1369
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,487
That scamming ass nigga Cliff.

1370
00:46:15,487 --> 00:46:17,885
Did you see his old raggedy gray hair ass

1371
00:46:17,885 --> 00:46:18,718
walking around here?

1372
00:46:18,718 --> 00:46:19,551
He's gonna tell me going outside

1373
00:46:19,551 --> 00:46:21,054
to get a key to his room

1374
00:46:21,054 --> 00:46:22,870
and then gonna act like this a mansion?

1375
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:23,736
Had me coming over here.

1376
00:46:23,736 --> 00:46:25,236
I paid for a Lyft.

- What are you doing?

1385
00:46:41,433 --> 00:46:42,803
- They are white, these
are not your cousins.

1386
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:43,636
- My mama was white.

1387
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:44,904

1388
00:46:44,904 --> 00:46:46,955

You're gonna go take the elevator

like the weather was right,

1628
00:57:28,185 --> 00:57:30,055
but the season was wrong.

1629
00:57:30,055 --> 00:57:33,219
No matter what I couldn't

I just wanna take you out.

1648
00:58:00,097 --> 00:58:01,865
I just want a second chance.
You're acting like you don't
believe in second chances.

1649
00:58:01,865 --> 00:58:03,549
- You think you're finna play me again,

00:58:03,549 --> 00:58:04,648

1658
00:58:14,445 --> 00:58:16,649
- I just think that you should
give me a second chance.

1659
00:58:16,649 --> 00:58:17,744
I can't stop thinking about you.

1660
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:18,597
I was trying to call you.

1661
00:58:18,597 --> 00:58:19,465
You done blocked my shit.

00:58:28,185 --> 00:58:29,407

1670
00:58:29,407 --> 00:58:30,240

00:58:40,004 --> 00:58:41,450
- Um, I don't know.

1679
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:43,432
- You can just figure that shit out.

1680
00:58:43,432 --> 00:58:44,522

1681
00:58:44,522 --> 00:58:45,355

1682
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,713
Don't worry about the

- All right.

1688
00:58:55,742 --> 00:58:56,614
- Look like you want a hug.

1689
00:58:56,614 --> 00:58:58,599
You want a hug?

1690
00:58:58,599 --> 00:58:59,536

1691
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,523
Now you're pushing it, do not play.

1692
00:59:02,523 --> 00:59:03,879
Or there will not be a second time.

1693

1697
00:59:13,891 --> 00:59:16,891

1705
00:59:32,766 --> 00:59:37,766
that's going to be my excuse
to leave his ass alone again.

1706
00:59:38,209 --> 00:59:41,861
I wish he would have
try to get some, please.

1707
00:59:41,861 --> 00:59:42,694
Negative.

00:59:45,769 --> 00:59:48,229

That's all, that's all I want.

1754
01:01:39,124 --> 01:01:43,361
- I would give you a hug but
you're playing too much but.

1755
01:01:43,361 --> 01:01:45,782
I guess I get rid of that droid.

01:01:45,782 --> 01:01:46,873
- Yeah, get rid of that.

1757
01:01:46,873 --> 01:01:47,925
You can keep everybody
else on the other line.

1758
01:01:47,925 --> 01:01:50,175
That's just for me and you.

1759
01:01:51,913 --> 01:01:52,746
- I can't believe this.

1760
01:01:52,746 --> 01:01:53,579
Oh my!

1761
01:01:54,507 --> 01:01:56,747
Wait till I tell Val about this.

1762
01:01:56,747 --> 01:02:00,001

1763
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:01,735
- No, but-
- You right, I ain't

1764
01:02:01,735 --> 01:02:05,538
- I mean, I can start

1765
01:02:05,538 --> 01:02:06,386

- But I mean, it's cool
'cause it's all good money.

1773
01:02:22,242 --> 01:02:24,226
If I wanted to strip I can.

01:02:24,226 --> 01:02:25,059
- I know you can.

1775
01:02:25,059 --> 01:02:26,272
I don't think you should.

1776
01:02:26,272 --> 01:02:27,535
When the next time you gotta go to work?

1777
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:28,888

- That's all I want you
to do is believe in me.

1785
01:02:42,655 --> 01:02:44,356
- Come here, give me a hug.

1786
01:02:44,356 --> 01:02:45,189
Thank you.

1787
01:02:45,189 --> 01:02:46,411
- You're welcome.

So soft, Keisha.

1789
01:02:47,756 --> 01:02:49,197

01:02:49,197 --> 01:02:50,030
But anyway...

- What?

1794
01:02:55,237 --> 01:02:56,292
Who told you that?

1795
01:02:56,292 --> 01:02:57,307
- Don't worry about who told me that.

1796
01:02:57,307 --> 01:02:58,590
- First of all, I've never been

1797
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:01,179
in a room by myself with that man.

1798
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:04,308
So you can go with that
bull crap and whoever else.

1799
01:03:04,308 --> 01:03:05,709
- I ain't trying to hit all that shit.

1800
01:03:05,709 --> 01:03:07,171

1802
01:03:09,026 --> 01:03:12,343
Are you serious?
- Did you fuck Snap or not?

1803
01:03:12,343 --> 01:03:14,627
- Do you believe that?

1804
01:03:18,276 --> 01:03:19,475
Do you?

1805
01:03:19,475 --> 01:03:21,211
If you did you wouldn't have
bought me all of this stuff?

1806
01:03:21,211 --> 01:03:23,261
- No.
- Whatever.

1807
01:03:23,261 --> 01:03:24,094

Keisha damn, you know it's on me.

1815
01:03:34,096 --> 01:03:35,596
- Because you have to redeem yourself.

1816
01:03:35,596 --> 01:03:36,597
- Get your fine ass upstairs,

1817
01:03:36,597 --> 01:03:38,306

1818
01:03:38,306 --> 01:03:40,556

You're looking good.

I don't care, just go

Guess what, I forgot.

1849
01:05:16,826 --> 01:05:18,828
My girl Savey was telling me
about this upscale restaurant.

1850
01:05:18,828 --> 01:05:20,428
So, I might need to change,

1851
01:05:20,428 --> 01:05:23,380
'cause I'm not giving
them all this pa pow.

1852
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:25,244
All these Caucasians, can't do it.

1853
01:05:25,244 --> 01:05:26,161
- About the restaurant,

1854
01:05:26,161 --> 01:05:27,942

1855
01:05:27,942 --> 01:05:30,412
- Hmm, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1856
01:05:30,412 --> 01:05:31,262
Rescheduled what?

1857
01:05:31,262 --> 01:05:32,095

1858
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:34,213
- Didn't you just ask me to go out to eat?

1859
01:05:34,213 --> 01:05:35,046
- I did.

1860
01:05:35,046 --> 01:05:36,917
- So you knew what you had to do
and when you have to do it right?

1861
01:05:36,917 --> 01:05:37,750
- Money calling.

1862
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:38,979
- I don't give a hell.

1863
01:05:38,979 --> 01:05:40,046
Don't you got money already?

1864
01:05:40,046 --> 01:05:41,382
You bought this big ass, little kid

01:05:43,323 --> 01:05:45,928
or I'm gonna have to keep getting money?

1868
01:05:45,928 --> 01:05:46,843
Let me ask you something.

1869
01:05:46,843 --> 01:05:47,676
Let me ask you something.

1870
01:05:47,676 --> 01:05:49,210
Let me ask you something.

You want a nigga with a

And the little bit of time

1874
01:05:54,694 --> 01:05:57,286

1878
01:06:02,016 --> 01:06:04,266
- I'm just trying to
keep you in the picture.
- So sick of this.

1879
01:06:04,266 --> 01:06:06,672
- We gonna reschedule it or not?

1880
01:06:06,672 --> 01:06:07,505
- Whatever.

1881
01:06:07,505 --> 01:06:08,338
- You got the new iPhone,

1882
01:06:08,338 --> 01:06:10,075
I'm gonna call you and
we gonna reschedule.

01:06:11,738 --> 01:06:12,972
- I ain't tryna be funny baby.

1885
01:06:12,972 --> 01:06:14,420
- You just can't get it right.

1886
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:15,332
- I'ma see you later.

1887
01:06:15,332 --> 01:06:17,506
- But anyway, whatever, bro.

1888
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:18,601
- Hey, don't walk away from me like that.

1889
01:06:18,601 --> 01:06:19,907
- I shouldn't have never called you.

1890
01:06:19,907 --> 01:06:20,858
That's my bad.

1891
01:06:20,858 --> 01:06:24,640
I wouldn't be going through this and that.

1892
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:25,611
- So we gonna reschedule or what?

1893
01:06:25,611 --> 01:06:27,060

you're feet to yourself.

1898
01:06:35,985 --> 01:06:36,818
- Hurry up.

1899
01:06:36,818 --> 01:06:39,084
- Call me tonight.

So, you know, we had to pull

01:06:52,722 --> 01:06:55,339
And when I say everybody was there,

1910
01:06:57,884 --> 01:07:01,098
All the dope boys, all the dope girls.

I ain't know she was
pulling up on me though.

01:07:17,768 --> 01:07:18,601
Fuck it.

1913

I guess I might have to
get my bill Bellamy on.

1914
01:07:25,367 --> 01:07:26,200
Who's that?

1915
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,033
Who's your friend?

1916
01:07:27,033 --> 01:07:28,699

Don't worry about her name.

1917
01:07:28,699 --> 01:07:29,532

Cliff, you're not my man.
