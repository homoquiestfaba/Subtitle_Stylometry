Hey, Linds. How was work?

- Why? What happened?

to the dance.

to go from high schooI freshman

to best-selling author in one semester?

844
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:49,262
Well, there's been
a lot of strange things

845
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:52,666
happening to me, but after a while,
you just get used to it.

846

Is Saves the World,

847

is the fastest-selling children's book
in Schilling Press history.

848
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,144

because Is relates to everyone.

Wow. Did you ever think
it would do so well?

853
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:17,319
Well, as I was writing
Is Saves the World,

854
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:21,262
I felt as if I had tapped into something
bigger than myself.

855
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:25,563
- And this is just the beginning.
- And that's what scares me the most.

856
00:48:25,636 --> 00:48:28,434
- I'm sorry, what scares you?
- Oh, nothing.

857
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:32,297
I just meant that people
can really relate to the story,

858
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:36,369
- although I'm not sure why.
- Oh, I do. It's a terrific story.

859
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:39,347
So tell us, Jamie, how did you
come up with it in the first place?

860
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,010
Well, my English teacher,
Miss Gallagher,

861
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,347
said to write what we know.

862
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,411
Wait. So you're saying
that Is Saves the World

863
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:48,458
- is based on real events?
- Oh, I couldn't make that stuff up.

864
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,790
- And the characters are real as well?
- Oh, they're very real. Yes.

865
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,921
Actually, some of my fans
have pointed out

866
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:57,057
that Is is no more
than an alter ego of myself.

867
00:48:58,302 --> 00:48:59,997
But she isn't.

868
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:02,061
Am I Is? Is isn't.

869
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,471
Is she? Am I Is?

870
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:08,677
You're Is? That's quite impressive.

871
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:12,010
Is battles evil in almost
every single chapter of the book.

872
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:15,449
What can I say?
Evil exists in many different forms.

873
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,545
And the more I talk to the kids,
the more I realize

874
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,590
that everyone
has a little bit of Is in them

875
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:21,988
and every school has a Sawyer.

876
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:24,858

877
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:26,225

JAMIE: Hey!

1005
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:31,344
-Here she comes.
-Hey, guys!

1006
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:34,117
You guys!
You guys, you have to heIp me.

1007
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,992
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

1008
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:40,856
Sawyer's running
a smear campaign against me.

1009
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:43,364
I need some positive PR,
and that's where you guys come in.

1010
00:56:43,433 --> 00:56:45,594
Have your handIer handIe it.

1011
00:56:46,169 --> 00:56:48,535
-What's her damage?
-You are.

1012
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:53,269
-Connor?
-I got Iaundry to do.

1013
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,773
But...

1014
00:56:58,448 --> 00:56:59,938
You guys, I...

1015
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:09,150
-WeII, I Iike white rice.
-But I... I couId try something eIse.

1016
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:15,125
She's such a Myrna.

1017
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,531
Come on, Marco.
Why don't we sit somewhere eIse?

1018
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:37,713
Oh, I never toId you how much I Iiked
that poem that you wrote.

1019
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:40,017
Don't bring that up.

1020
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:43,217
That was too embarrassing.
Reading that in front of the cIass?

1021
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,261
-So Iame.
-No, it wasn't.

1022
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,927
I Ioved it. It was so reaI.

1023
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,734
Are you gonna eat those?

1024
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:54,392
No.

1025
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:13,150
WeII, I don't understand it.
We put ads in aII the IocaI papers.

1026
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,123
This pIace
shouId be a madhouse by now.

1027
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:16,522
Yeah, weII,
business has been kind of off

1028
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,390
since Jamie's IittIe announcement
Iast week.

1029
00:58:18,461 --> 00:58:21,294
Maybe aII we need is a new pizza
to pick things up.

1030
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,491
PickIed pork-ear pizza, Peg?

1031
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:29,805
-Maybe it's time to cut our Iosses.
-Where is everyone?

1032
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,535
I mean, I can't beIieve
we onIy soId two books.

1033
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:35,578
It's a good thing
RaIph's parents showed up.

1034
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:36,942
Oh, good!

1035
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:42,447
Wait. Here they come! Customers.

1036
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,214
We have customers!

1037

1038
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:48,481
Wait! Wait!

1039
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,996
HooIigans. We have hooIigans.

1040
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:00,125
What happened?

1041
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,646
I'm back.

1042
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:22,487
Lindsay, don't sneak up on me
when I'm working on our masterpiece.

1043
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:25,960
Yeah. I've been thinking about what
we shouId stuff our masterpiece with.

1044
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:29,430
Oh, I know.
I have been driving myseIf bonkers.

1045
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,933
What is gonna give our whaIe Iife?

1046
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:34,094
Newspaper? Foam?

1047

1048
00:59:36,372 --> 00:59:38,101
Yeah. AII great suggestions,

1049
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:41,302
but I was thinking of something
a IittIe more proactive.

1050
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:44,707
And...

1051
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,878
I know this whaIe means a Iot to you,

1052
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:54,321
but this is an incredibIe opportunity
to make a statement.

1053
00:59:54,390 --> 00:59:57,416
I can't do it without you.
What do you think?

1054
01:00:01,297 --> 01:00:04,391
I think it'II take our creation
to the next IeveI.

1055
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:08,597
True art isn't meant to be just seen.
It's meant to be experienced.

1056
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:10,872
You can't give the peopIe
what they want.

1057
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:14,432
You have to show them what they want.
What they need.

1058
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,343
-Was that a ''yes''?
-That was a ''heck, yes.''

1059
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:23,082
-That was humiIiating.
-LocaI market's fickIe.

1060
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:27,054
You said that business wouId pick up,
but it's been empty aII week.

1061
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:30,354
What do you want from me?
Nobody wants to eat with a tattIetaIe.

1062
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:32,758
-They're aII afraid of you.
-No, they're afraid of you.

1063

Me? I'm just a figment
of your imagination.

1064

No, you're not.

I didn't mean those things

1071
01:01:06,963 --> 01:01:08,988
