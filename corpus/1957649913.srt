1067
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,290
-Well, at least
 I'm back to normal.

1068
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:26,260
[RIBBET SOUND]

1069
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:28,440
-Ahoy, civilians.

1070
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,390
-Hey, Mr. Flopchek.

1071
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:34,600
-I'm looking for those
 goddamn witches, Stewart.

1072
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,270
And when they come
 back, I'm gonna

1073
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:38,230
be waiting for them this time.

1074
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:39,130
-Thanks, Mr. Flopchek.

1075
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:47,930
Oh, man, I don't believe this.

1076
00:59:47,930 --> 00:59:50,250
-What do you think
 of my new wheels?

1077
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,730
Do you wanna go for a ride?

1078
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:56,430
-Well, yeah.

1079
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:57,810
How'd you get back here?

1080
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:02,570
-A good magician never
 gives away her tricks.

1081
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:03,510
-So where we going?

1082
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:05,260
-I don't know.

1083
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,340
Ever been to Stonehenge?

1084
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,040
-Stonehenge?

1085
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:13,330
-Hey, guys.

1086
01:00:13,330 --> 01:00:14,740
You forgot me.

1087
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:21,520
[SIGHS] Maybe I can find
 some more flies or something.

1088
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,810
-Come on, Chewy.

1089
01:00:31,810 --> 01:00:33,430
Come on, Chewy.

1090
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:34,680
Just quit fooling around.

1091
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,980
It's, it's breakfast time.

1092
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:38,560
-I wish you wouldn't
 talk to that.

1093
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,670
That thing's-- that's
 not even alive.

1094
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:43,120
What do you do that for?

1095
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:44,470
-Dear--

1096
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:48,580
-Well, I just hate babying
 your mother all the time.

1097
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:50,710
Why can't somebody
 just stop mincing words

1098
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:53,470
and tell her that thing is dead?

1099
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:56,430
-That's just plain nonsense.

1100
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:58,080
Chewy is so alive.

1101
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,330
