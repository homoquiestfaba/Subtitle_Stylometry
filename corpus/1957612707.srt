We have a problem.

[Kavinsky] How the hell
did he find these guys?

7
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,494
You know, Manson booked
himself a date.

8
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,462
You see that girl?

9
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,364
[Miller] Yeah,
they're supposed to blend in.

10
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,900
[Kavinsky]
Come on, blend in?

11
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:48,402
They're op names
are Bundy and Manson.

12
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:58,445
What is it,
your first car ride?

13
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,749
Please, I worked for Uber
for six months before this.

15
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,286
Almost got me there.

Where are we at with Reese?

17
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,428
Reese, you set?

No idea the shit storm
about to come down on them.

21
00:03:21,803 --> 00:03:23,570
All right.

22
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:26,540
Reese...

23
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,241

31
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,845
Why would you go hide
in a shithole?

32
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:07,447
Because no one cares
about a cockroach in a dumpster.

[Kavinsky] <i>All right, remember
those weapons are for show.</i>

39
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,439
We have no legal backing here,
so no shots fired.

All right, meet me
at the extraction point.

60
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,786
Yeah.

I know you got
no friends anymore.

65
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:44,972
But, man,
it was easy to find you.

66
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,943
We had to come.

67
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,578
You knew that.

Rookies outside weren't supposed
to be around for the kill.

- Secure him.

No, this is all wrong.

Who are you?

100
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,050
Omar, my name is Bill.

101
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:47,787
And there's only one path
that leads you out of this very,

102
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,224
very uncomfortable situation.

103
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,260
I dearly hope
you'll take it.

104
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,662
Where am I?

105
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,898
What do you want?

106
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,901
I just want you to answer
questions honestly, that's it.

107
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,172
That's all you have to do.
That's all.

108
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:07,874
So let's start
with a simple one.

109
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:12,011
Are you a member of
the Crescent Democratic Front?

110
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,647
Listen, I have
asylum in the West.

111
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,016
- Yeah.
- Me and my wife both do.

112
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,885
- Okay?
- Yeah.

113
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,653
I was on my way
to London to meet her

114
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,423
- when you kidnapped me.
- I understand all that,

115
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:24,057
but you didn't
answer my question.

116
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,360
Are you a member of the CDF?

117
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,061
It's your group,
your organization.

118
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,296
You run it?

119
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,097
- Yes!
- Yes. Okay.

120
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:34,667
See, the publicly stated
goals of the CDF

121
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,371
are to oust the dictator
Bandar el-Mizdawi,

122
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,038
which is great.

123
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,107
I'm all for ousting dictators.

124
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:43,009
Exactly, that...
That is what we're trying to do.

125
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:45,778
Good, I like that. Here's where
you run into difficulty.

126
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,916
So tell me something.

127
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,254
Do you know these men?

128
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,095
No!

129
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,963
Because the CDF
claims to be a charity.

130
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,833
It's purely altruistic,
all right?

131
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:10,003
But we have Intel
that shows that you received

132
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,006
more than $2 million in
donations recently from these...

133
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,276
These extremists.
That's what they are.

134
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:17,844
They never uttered the word
"charity" in their lives.

135
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:20,181
- I don't know these men!
- Well, I'll tell you about them.

136
00:11:20,214 --> 00:11:22,982
They only associate
with terrorists.

137
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,918
So you can understand
our concern

138
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:28,455
about you
and your operation.

139
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:30,123
You understand
why I'd want to know

140
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:31,791
why they got involved
in the financing.

141
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,726
They're not financing
my operation.

142
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,229
What are you talking about?

143
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,264
You making up lies?

144
00:11:37,298 --> 00:11:40,301
We are funded
by legitimate backers.

145
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:41,502
Mm-hmm.

146
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,504
People who want to bring peace.

147
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,838
I understand that.
That's absolutely true.

148
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,041
Up until recently, but now,

149
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,843
the bank statements say
that things have changed.

150
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,745
- No, no, no.
- Omar...

151
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,448
- That's not true.
- I want to believe you,

152
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:55,815
but you got to help me.

153
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:57,016
You got to give me something.

154
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,419
What are we supposed to think?

155
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,454
The United States
and its allies, we...

156
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,223
Traditionally,
we've granted asylum

157
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:05,792
to individuals
who've formed groups

158
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,027
that are seemingly
in line with our values.

159
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,463
But sometimes...

160
00:12:09,496 --> 00:12:12,966
sometimes, Omar,
those groups...

161
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:14,401
well, they're taking advantage

162
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:16,035
of the privilege
that we offer them,

163
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,804
and they change
their motives.

164
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:22,243
And sometimes they had
different motives all along.

165
00:12:22,276 --> 00:12:23,977
Sometimes there are terrorists,

166
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,778
and they wanted to work
against the governments

167
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,814
- that were trying to help them.
- No, we are not terrorists.

168
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,516
You're right. You know what?
The word "terrorist,"

169
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,950
it's a... It's a label.

170
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,152
- Maybe you are.
- Maybe I am.

171
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,021
It's a question
of perspective, right?

172
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:38,492
So from my perspective,
my government's perspective,

173
00:12:38,525 --> 00:12:41,528
you must understand,
we have to know...

174
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,231
how these dangerous men
came to be involved

175
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,367
with your group.

176
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,934
Why?

177
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,802
What did they want?

178
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:51,538
- I don't know these people!
- When I walked in the room

179
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:54,941
I said there's only one way
out of this for you,

180
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,876
and that's to help me.

181
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,579
So far, you've given me nothing.

182
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,980
I don't know them. How many
times am I telling you this?

183
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,516
Now you know why we're here.

184
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,351
Understand what
we have to talk about.

185
00:13:04,385 --> 00:13:06,152
- I have an asylum.
- So you think about it.

186
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,054
- Hey!
- All right, Omar.

187
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:09,989
Hey, come on, man.
You can't...

188
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,824
You cannot do this to me.

189
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,460
I'm going to give you
a little time to think about it.

190
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:15,596
- Think about what?
- To look at the pictures.

191
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,864
See if maybe it
triggers off some memories.

192
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,566
What?

193
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,302
I don't know these men!

194
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:23,236
- I'll see you soon.
- Hey!

195
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,439
I don't know these men!

196
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,475
[sighs]

197
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:30,043
[Visser]
Now what?

198
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,211
Now we let him think.

199
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,280
We don't have time
to let him think.

200
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:37,250
Our orders are to extract
Intel that is time-sensitive

201
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:39,052
to our people
in the field today.

202
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,953
They're my orders.

203
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,489
Harris, what you got?

204
00:13:42,523 --> 00:13:44,023
[Harris]
Well, I checked him out.

205
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,426
All his papers
are the real deal.

206
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:47,193
He's both U.S.
and U.K. backed.

207
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:49,962
This group comes over here
telling us what we want to hear,

208
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,165
and then they
start working on undermining

209
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,467
Western civilization.

210
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,935
You could tone down
the hyperbole.

211
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:59,340
I'm just saying, like,
we can make quick work of this.

212
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:01,375
What are they
teaching you nowadays?

213
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:05,346
We're here to get the truth,
not force faulty Intel.

214
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:10,983
Bill's been doing this
a long time.

215
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,386
Yeah, I don't get it.

216
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,053
You don't need to get it.

217
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:15,988
We know what we're doing.

218
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,024
Why don't you
just sit back and learn.

219
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,593
[sighs]

220
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,664
May I give it a go?
I have an idea.

221
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,265
Gentle, direct.

222
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,537
A slightly different
angle than yours.

223
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,874
Now we're talking.

224
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:40,614
[engine revving]

225
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,654
- We got to ditch the car.
- Negative.

226
00:14:47,688 --> 00:14:49,690
- Negative to what part?
- [Reese] Negative all around.

227
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,125
Those cops clocked our
faces and the vehicle.

228
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,395
They may be French,
but they can't be that stupid.

229
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:56,463
I knew something was wrong.
I knew it!

230
00:14:56,497 --> 00:14:58,164
That guy knew
we were coming.

231
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,199
I'm telling you
we have to ditch the car.

232
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,135
If the target knew we were
coming, he might have friends.

233
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:06,038
The best move is to move faster.
Take us straight to the plane.

234
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,409
You need to let control know
that we're going to be early.

235
00:15:08,442 --> 00:15:10,444
You need to just drive.

236
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,346
You see this?

237
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,314
- Right here, 5:00.
- Shit.

238
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:17,518
[Kavinsky]
There's a mark on your 5:00.

239
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:36,068
All right, no communication
until we get to the plane.

240
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,639
We don't want to risk
anything getting intercepted.

241
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,607
If he knew we were coming,
why did he stick around,

242
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:43,109
then pick a fight,
then surrender to us?

243
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,044
We have the target,
we're on course.

244
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,146
One step at a time.

245
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,460
[Olsen]
Here, sit down.

246
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,360
Make yourself comfortable.

247
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,330
Is this your office?

248
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,635
No, no, this is just
where we meet the new recruits.

249
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:11,538
My place, not nearly
as cushy as this.

250
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:13,774
Aren't there usually
cameras in these meetings?

251
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:17,711
Oh, yeah, but we have
plenty of tape on you.

252
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,148
Yeah, exactly.

253
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,684
Hey, why'd you call me in now?

254
00:16:23,717 --> 00:16:26,118
You've denied my application
five times in a row.

255
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,187
You've... I haven't
declined anything.

256
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,355
Oh, my God.

257
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,625
The Collective Agency, you.

258
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,760
Oh, okay, well,
I could see why that might be

259
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:36,597
a little confusing
for you, um...

260
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,769
Your D.O.D. file says you really
crashed and burned there,

261
00:16:42,803 --> 00:16:44,805
and that's why
they've rejected you here.

262
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:46,740
[chuckles]

263
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,579
Look I didn't have time
to crash and burn, all right?

264
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:56,048
I was sent home immediately.
I have no idea why.

265
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:59,485
Yeah, I can see
you're upset by that.

266
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:02,623
I can't say it felt good.

267
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:05,391
No, I can imagine
I really don't get it.

268
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:08,394
You're smart, ROTC, two tours.

269
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,230
Completed your service.

270
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:14,200
Only to wash out
after a month at D.O.D.

271
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,769
Right.

272
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:20,439
[sighs]
Definitely not ideal.

273
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,145
And since then, you've been
working in the private sector.

274
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:28,582
Why don't you tell me
about that.

275
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,451
Uh...

276
00:17:32,485 --> 00:17:36,322
it was a couple stints overseas,
you know?

277
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,157
And, yeah, mainly security.

278
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,360
Looking after the fat kid,

279
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,130
wondering what's under
mama's yashmak.

280
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:47,166
Well...

281
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,136
You ever been team leader?

282
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:55,709
Uh, what?

283
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:58,544
What would you say if I told you
to apply one more time?

284
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,316
Lucky number six.

285
00:18:06,587 --> 00:18:08,254
[chuckles softly]

286
00:18:09,723 --> 00:18:11,490
[chains rattle]

287
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,161
It's okay.

288
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:20,333
Here.

289
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,809
Where am I?

290
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:33,279
This is called a Black Site.

291
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,281
Nobody knows it's here.

292
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,787
Is my wife okay?

293
00:18:40,821 --> 00:18:42,656
I'm sorry.

294
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,157
I'm just a foot soldier.
They don't tell me anything.

295
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,329
I'm not even supposed
to be in here right now.

296
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,799
I was worried about you.

297
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:58,270
I don't have much to offer,
but I'm not your enemy.

298
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,540
Drink.

299
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:04,377
You have to.

300
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,348
Little more.

301
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:12,184
<i>You know the others here,
they're not like me.</i>

302
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:21,762
Can you please find out
about my wife?

303
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,197
What's her name?

304
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:26,667
Fatima.

305
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,804
That's a lovely name.

306
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,573
I'll see what I can do.

307
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,375
Thank you.

308
00:19:40,714 --> 00:19:42,415
[door opens]

309
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,885
[door slams]

310
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,588
Well, not how
I would have started.

311
00:19:49,622 --> 00:19:51,792
Not bad, right?

312
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:53,459
[sighs]

313
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:57,263
[engine revving]

314
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,902
You can't just waltz in
through the front gate.

315
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:04,637
I thought it was supposed
to be our people on there.

316
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,272
Supposed to be.

317
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,775
[sighs]
Christ.

318
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,277
[tires screech]

319
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,931
Holy shit, who hired
Nance and Rand to fly the plane?

320
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,300
Wait, wait, hit the brights.

321
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,504
Go, go!

322
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,873
Hands behind your head.

323
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,607
- [man] What the...?
- Behind your head!

324
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,976
- Do it! Don't move!
- [Kavinsky] Turn around!

325
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,745
- [woman] Hey!
- Don't move!

326
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:46,512
All right,
pat them down.

327
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:49,983
- [Miller] Clear.
- All right, keep them covered.

328
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,818
- Keep an eye out.
- [Miller] Copy.

329
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:47,673
All right.

330
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,341
Don't move.

331
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,510
[Kavinsky]
All right, we're clear.

332
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,748
Let me see.

333
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:57,550
What the hell is this, man?
We're just the pilots.

334
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,052
We pick you up and drop you off.
That's it.

335
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,554
Hey, just relax, Pops.
It's for the Gramp.

336
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:03,422
Right, turn around.
It's all right. It's all right.

337
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:05,457
Aren't there supposed
to be more of you?

338
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,430
Are we good?

339
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,867
They're good. Get us prepped.
We need to move fast.

340
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,568
[Reese]
I'm grabbing our guy.

341
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,109
Hey, wake up, sleepyhead.

342
00:22:23,143 --> 00:22:25,811
Let's go. Hey, get up.

343
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,081
This way.

344
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:32,052
[watch vibrates]

345
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:35,387
Step.

346
00:22:40,093 --> 00:22:41,827
Hey, Miller,
check your line.

347
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,597
[Miller]
We're good!

348
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:07,988
What about the wife?

349
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:11,024
He gave me her name.
We pick her up, we use her.

350
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,726
We've just abducted
one possibly innocent man.

351
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,629
We're definitely
not taking his wife.

352
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,702
He's hitting a wall.

353
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,206
Bill is not hitting a wall.

354
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,074
We kidnap people
and transport them

355
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:29,976
to other countries
willing to look the other way

356
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,844
while we interrogate them.

357
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,747
But we do that
with the flag on our back.

358
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,483
It's a dangerous grey area
to do business in,

359
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:40,753
but we have to be careful
about drawing a moral line.

360
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:48,861
Orders are the only line.

361
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,601
All right,
little buddy.

362
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,237
Let's get you all
strapped in here.

363
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,738
That's nice.
Now you can't move.

364
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,044
Going to get
your little feeties.

365
00:24:04,077 --> 00:24:05,678
There you go, there.

366
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:08,580
If you need to go potty,
just wiggle around.

367
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,550
That's good.

368
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,086
[typing]

369
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,088
Now you can relax.

370
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:17,523
[sighs]

371
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:18,791
Target's secure.

372
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,859
All right,
get us up and running.

373
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:24,730
- I want updates in flight.
- [Miller] We're good to go.

374
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,266
[Martin]
Estimate 11 hours until landing.

375
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:28,134
This is all weird.

376
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:31,972
Yeah, somebody is
really aching for this guy.

377
00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:33,806
Yep.

378
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,942
Call me crazy,
but wouldn't this job be

379
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:39,245
a hell of a lot easier if we
actually had some information?

380
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,250
Well, you know the drill.

381
00:24:44,284 --> 00:24:46,919
The more we know,
the more we're accountable to.

382
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,055
No, I don't know the drill,
but the more I learn about it

383
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:50,756
the more I don't like it.

384
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:56,129
Well, you get
too much back-story,

385
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:59,032
and suddenly maybe we start
deciding for ourselves.

386
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:02,235
The difference
between right and wrong.

387
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:06,139
It makes it hard for us
just to follow orders.

388
00:25:30,363 --> 00:25:32,731
Oh.

389
00:25:37,337 --> 00:25:39,938
I never met
a pageant winner before.

390
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:43,575
Who have you met?

391
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:44,977
Oh, all kinds of people.

392
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,646
Criminals, drug dealers,
the odd despot.

393
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,083
No...

394
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,653
You're not the usual fish,
are you?

395
00:25:54,686 --> 00:26:00,193
You're like a slice of
American pie without the apples.

396
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,900
What are you getting at?

397
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:10,270
You go to a top college
and you drop out.

398
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:11,870
I don't get it.

399
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:14,274
Mm-hmm. I went back.

400
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:16,675
You went back?

401
00:26:18,144 --> 00:26:22,881
Magna cum laude
is more than just going back.

402
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,353
But then you drop out
a second time,

403
00:26:27,387 --> 00:26:28,921
right at the end
of law school.

404
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,589
What gives?

405
00:26:35,228 --> 00:26:37,796
I think you already
know the answer to that.

406
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,766
Did it have something to do with
that classmate's ass you kicked

407
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,668
and put him in the hospital?

408
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,170
You mean my professor?

409
00:26:44,204 --> 00:26:46,738
Professor? Ah, that's good.

410
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:49,142
He must have really
given you a bad grade.

411
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:50,709
I gave him a black eye.

412
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:51,910
[laughs]

413
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,078
He gave you a black mark.

414
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:55,047
- [chuckles]
- So pretty good.

415
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,316
Hmm.

416
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:59,751
I see that's sort of behavior

417
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:03,755
as an advantage for you and me,
quite frankly in us.

418
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:07,025
Most people would hardly
consider a temper

419
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:10,363
and difficulty forming
relationships an advantage.

420
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:16,768
Well, we are big believers
in practical application here.

421
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,670
I don't know what practical
application means.

422
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:21,374
Good, keep it that way.

423
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,876
You're a very
well-tabernacled spirit.

424
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,345
[chuckles]

425
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:27,180
See, if I figure if we
put you in the right place

426
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:29,215
and the right circumstances,

427
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:31,184
it could be advantageous
to everyone,

428
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:33,018
including your country.

429
00:27:36,356 --> 00:27:37,756
Hmm.

430
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,292
Tell me more.

431
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,761
[chains rattling]

432
00:27:44,164 --> 00:27:46,432
[Olsen, on phone]
<i>The clock is ticking on Omar.</i>

433
00:27:46,466 --> 00:27:49,369
Well, sir, he insists
he's never met the targets,

434
00:27:49,402 --> 00:27:51,471
and he's adamant
that the CDF exists

435
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:54,039
only to resist el-Mizdawi.

436
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,708
If there's no Intel
to be gained...

437
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,012
move on to the next phase.

438
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:02,315
Well, where's the
Intel come from, sir?

439
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:05,318
It's... It's wafer thin.
It's a couple of documents.

440
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,420
<i>You got to go in
and bring home the bacon.</i>

441
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:11,089
I understand, but no...
With respect, sir...

442
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,958
- <i>Do it.</i>
- I...

443
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,361
Sounds like we're on
the same page.

444
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:17,197
Yeah, copy that, sir.

445
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,797
Shut the door.

446
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:21,334
[door closes]

447
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,835
They're pushing us.
They're pushing us on this guy.

448
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:28,441
And there's... There's something
they're not telling us.

449
00:28:28,474 --> 00:28:30,776
Well, it's not the first time.

450
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,778
I don't think
Omar's met those men.

451
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,347
I don't think even
if they find us,

452
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,183
then the CDF has
any idea, do you?

453
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:40,118
Well, what about the wife?

454
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,890
Oh, shut the...

455
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:47,993
Visser had surveillance on her?

456
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,396
Yeah.

457
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,964
[sighs]

458
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,499
Fine.

459
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:55,934
Let's use the wife,
let's amp up the dramatics.

460
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:00,540
Hey, Harris...

461
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:03,509
whatever they end up
telling us on this,

462
00:29:03,543 --> 00:29:06,412
you help me keep
my head straight.

463
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,147
All right?

464
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,451
Never seen you
call one wrong.

465
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:14,820
Funny.

466
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:20,759
[door closes]

467
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,402
[typing]

468
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:32,472
Hey, you stressed?

469
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:35,508
[chuckles]

470
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,377
No, no, no, no,
it's pretty standard.

471
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:40,413
Way to pop my cherry.

472
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:45,250
Are you seriously telling me
this is your first time?

473
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,289
Yeah, man, we're getting
to know each other here.

474
00:29:49,322 --> 00:29:51,324
Let me get in here.

475
00:29:51,357 --> 00:29:54,159
Kavinsky,
you're a Marine, right?

476
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:55,994
When I was behind you
on that staircase,

477
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:58,030
I thought: That's Kavinsky,
he's got to be a Marine.

478
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:02,568
Either that or, I don't know,
Polish fitness influencer.

479
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:04,404
Now look at you.

480
00:30:04,437 --> 00:30:06,472
- Yeah, what about you.
- Huh?

481
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:08,073
You're too dumb
to be Air Force,

482
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,941
you don't complain
enough to be Navy,

483
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,412
but you're too pretty
to be Army.

484
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:14,079
- Maybe he's Coast Guard.
- [chuckles]

485
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,248
Royal Canadian
Coast Guard, actually.

486
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:20,018
Just a boot rec.
Well, spent some time in Warsaw.

487
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:22,888
Hmm. Agency after?

488
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:26,258
Yeah, I bounced around
a little bit.

489
00:30:26,291 --> 00:30:27,993
What bounced around?
Bounced around where?

490
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,595
Typical shitbag stuff.

491
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:32,565
Developed some bad habits
in the stan countries.

492
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:35,967
Yeah, I guess we all did.

493
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,471
Yeah, but I guess the agency
likes some of my bad habits,

494
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,541
because here I am. It's good
to be back in the game again.

495
00:30:44,477 --> 00:30:46,612
How about you?
How long you been a company man?

496
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,615
[chuckles]

497
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:52,184
Well, come on now.
Give me something.

498
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:54,587
Be good to know something about
a guy I'm in the shit with.

499
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:57,457
It's a recent development.

500
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:59,057
Really?

501
00:30:59,091 --> 00:31:00,660
I'd have pegged you
for a salty dog.

502
00:31:00,693 --> 00:31:02,894
I always wanted
into the agency,

503
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:05,398
but I guess it took a minute or
two to line things up and all.

504
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:08,967
I hear that.
It's a tough career choice.

505
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:14,306
Oh, hi, Poindexter.
Tell us about yourself, babe.

506
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,907
How'd you end up here?

507
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:18,478
When it comes to passing
and failing a test,

508
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:20,312
I'm a loose cannon.

509
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,948
Give me life or death,
and I'm surprisingly cool.

510
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,218
But overall, I'm bored.

511
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:29,389
She's a dream recruit.

512
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:33,925
Well, look at us,
knucklehead, jarhead, baghead,

513
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:36,294
and a surprisingly cool head.

514
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,930
We're a ragtag bunch.

515
00:31:38,964 --> 00:31:40,633
But this is good.

516
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:43,935
Getting to know each other.
I'm feeling safer already.

517
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:46,572
Well, as long as you feel good,
that's all that matters, right?

518
00:31:46,606 --> 00:31:49,675
You guys hungry?
I saw some almonds back there.

519
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:52,177
I'm going to get some almonds.
You want some?

520
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,980
[chains rattling]

521
00:32:02,522 --> 00:32:04,322
What do you want?

522
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,595
Omar, we've reached
a point now where...

523
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:12,097
we're going to have
to escalate things.

524
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:15,167
So I'm going to ask you
one last time,

525
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,672
why are these men
involved with CDF?

526
00:32:19,705 --> 00:32:22,040
[Omar] For the hundredth time,
they are not!

527
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,076
Okay.

528
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,092
I'll kill you!

529
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,994
[Omar shouting]

530
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:46,398
These were taken
about an hour ago.

531
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:49,134
- What do you want from her?
- Omar, she's terrified.

532
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,703
She probably thinks you're dead.

533
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:53,338
Just let her go, man.
What do you want?

534
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,608
To be honest, I don't know when
you're going to see her again,

535
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:57,710
- because we got to bring her in.
- For what?

536
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:59,444
She haven't done anything.

537
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:02,280
She's the only lead we have
apart from you.

538
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:05,450
I told you everything.
What do you want from me?

539
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,755
Ghuma Nasuf.

540
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:11,256
He was granted asylum
in the West,

541
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,758
just like you five years ago.

542
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:15,260
He disappears,
he reappears five years later

543
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:17,395
spreading anti-American
propaganda around mosques.

544
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:20,566
He's radicalizing young kids

545
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,502
to kill Jews,
kill Christians.

546
00:33:22,535 --> 00:33:24,804
Then arrest him.
What do you want from my wife?

547
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:26,672
This guy...

548
00:33:26,706 --> 00:33:28,574
this guy could have worked
for any of the big four.

549
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:31,644
Instead he chooses
to run finances for Al-Qaeda

550
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,311
and Chechen rebels.

551
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,448
And now he's got his
fingers in the CDF.

552
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,083
Why?

553
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,589
These men and I may have
a hundred things in common,

554
00:33:43,623 --> 00:33:46,424
but we're not the same.

555
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,126
My goal is,
and always will be,

556
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,395
to rid of el-Mizdawi
from our country.

557
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,297
Just because you're American

558
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,701
doesn't mean your colleagues
share the same goal as you.

559
00:33:57,235 --> 00:34:00,305
I am a patriot. Are you?

560
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:11,082
Shit.

561
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,455
All right, look, Omar,

562
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,824
I like what you say
in public.

563
00:34:18,858 --> 00:34:20,458
I admire you.

564
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,527
I watch your speeches.
We both have.

565
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,831
I think you're a brave man.

566
00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:28,601
Here's what I think happened.
I think they tricked you.

567
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,837
I think they lied to you...

568
00:34:33,606 --> 00:34:37,175
and I think that once they put
that much money into your group,

569
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:39,745
you don't think
you can back out.

570
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:42,648
But I'm telling you,
you can't trust them.

571
00:34:44,617 --> 00:34:46,451
Then why you trust
this bullshit?

572
00:34:53,893 --> 00:34:55,393
Maybe you are a patriot.

573
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,897
Maybe, all you want
is to topple

574
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,599
a dictator's oppression
of your people.

575
00:34:59,632 --> 00:35:02,233
But unless you can prove to me

576
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,737
that these people
are not involved with CDF

577
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:07,405
or that you don't know
what they're planning,

578
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,676
then you're guilty
by association.

579
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:14,880
And so is your wife.

580
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,468
[door slams shut]

581
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:43,308
It was the right move.
He'll buckle.

582
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:45,711
He's telling the truth.

583
00:35:45,745 --> 00:35:47,379
What? How do you know?

584
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,614
Because I know.
Because it's my job to know.

585
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:50,950
Because I've been doing
it for 30 years

586
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,617
since you were in diapers.

587
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,352
Yeah, and we don't do it
like that anymore.

588
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:55,921
We got to get him
out of here, Harris.

589
00:35:55,955 --> 00:35:57,723
- [Harris] I know, I know.
- No, no, no, no. I...

590
00:35:57,757 --> 00:35:59,892
Are you actually...?
Can you handle this?

591
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:01,292
- Get her out.
- Visser,

592
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,895
give us the room please.

593
00:36:14,907 --> 00:36:18,410
What are we doing?
What the fuck are we doing?

594
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,746
Well, he will recover.

595
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,883
Though it's done worse.

596
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,786
[scoffs]
Yeah.

597
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:29,654
I want you to dig.

598
00:36:29,689 --> 00:36:31,589
Keep it all quiet,
backdoor info.

599
00:36:31,623 --> 00:36:33,793
I want to know why
they really want this guy.

600
00:36:33,826 --> 00:36:36,227
There's a reason info
like that's compartmentalized.

601
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:38,698
Once you know it,
you're responsible for it.

602
00:36:38,731 --> 00:36:40,432
Yeah, well, I'm done.

603
00:36:40,465 --> 00:36:42,735
It's not working
for me anymore.

604
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:46,337
I know a few guys
closer to the field.

605
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,406
Spend a lot of time
in the gray.

606
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,742
They won't bullshit me.

607
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:51,409
Thanks.

608
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:54,279
[door opens and closes]

609
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,915
Shit.

610
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,617
[keyboard clacking]

611
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:01,586
[sighs]

612
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:20,940
[watch vibrates]

613
00:37:26,846 --> 00:37:28,713
[typing]

614
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:12,057
- [Miller] You get any updates?
- No.

615
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:14,794
It was just, uh...
It's radio silence.

616
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:16,896
Copy you.

617
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:21,967
You guys seen
any water around here?

618
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:24,369
[Reese]
Sink in the back.

619
00:38:28,841 --> 00:38:30,810
[typing]

620
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,450
[Olsen, on phone]
<i>Bill's a true believer.</i>

621
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:40,920
He's served his country well,

622
00:38:40,953 --> 00:38:43,122
and he'll continue
to serve his country.

623
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:45,590
It's what he signed up to do.

624
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,393
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

625
00:38:48,426 --> 00:38:51,796
Our mission is to keep
the wars small...

626
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,632
the sacrifices meaningful...

627
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:58,670
and the story
out of the news.

628
00:39:00,705 --> 00:39:02,640
We're officially
in clean-up mode.

629
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:03,808
Clear?

630
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:05,677
Clear, sir.

631
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,547
You know what's required, yes?

632
00:39:11,416 --> 00:39:12,852
Yes, sir.

633
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:17,422
You were right.
It's a mess.

634
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,490
There has been
a major shift.

635
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,793
We're getting in bed
with el-Mizdawi.

636
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,896
The guy we've been trying
to get rid of for years?

637
00:39:23,929 --> 00:39:25,396
- Yeah.
- Literally five years

638
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,032
in shitholes like this?

639
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:29,034
This is a letter from
el-Mizdawi's intelligence chief

640
00:39:29,068 --> 00:39:31,436
sent to our station
in Qatar.

641
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,404
Intercepted by the French,

642
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:35,007
got in the hands of
my men on the ground

643
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,674
who made friends
in the Riviera.

644
00:39:36,708 --> 00:39:38,077
They're making a deal
with this piece of shit.

645
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,678
El-Mizdawi hates
Al-Qaeda so much,

646
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,648
he's allowing us access to his
resources to help hunt him down.

647
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:44,984
[sighs]
Nice guy.

648
00:39:45,017 --> 00:39:46,886
Yeah, and as a gesture
of good faith,

649
00:39:46,919 --> 00:39:49,787
what do you think our new
best friend is asking in return?

650
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:51,556
Round up his enemies,

651
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:52,925
people who've been
trying to oust him.

652
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:54,425
- Yeah.
- We've been protecting,

653
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:55,793
we send them back.

654
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,762
And a week after
the deal was made,

655
00:39:57,795 --> 00:39:59,831
we get orders
to pick up Omar.

656
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:01,866
He's a fucking sacrifice.

657
00:40:04,003 --> 00:40:06,604
[Reese] And see if you can
find a pillow for me.

658
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:08,040
[sighs]

659
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,909
Power napping.

660
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,480
Here you go, sweetheart.

661
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:17,216
- Hey.
- Here, keep yourself warm too.

662
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:19,884
Look at this,
first class.

663
00:40:25,224 --> 00:40:26,457
This ain't no blanket.

664
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:27,927
[Kavinsky]
What?

665
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,094
This is a body bag.

666
00:40:29,128 --> 00:40:30,628
[Kavinsky]
What the fuck?

667
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:32,998
Kind of blanket
you don't take off.

668
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:34,967
[Kavinsky] It was folded
in between the fucking pillows.

669
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,202
- What's this doing out here?
- How I was supposed to know

670
00:40:37,236 --> 00:40:38,971
they were body bags?
They were neatly folded.

671
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:40,638
- Thought you checked the plane.
- Fuck you!

672
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:42,041
[Reese] What are you
talking about, fuck me?

673
00:40:42,074 --> 00:40:43,775
[Kavinsky]
I cleared the fucking plane!

674
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,210
- Are you saying fuck me?
- Yeah, fuck you!

675
00:40:45,244 --> 00:40:46,844
[Reese]
I'm asking you why you gave me...

676
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:48,913
- What the fuck was that?
- Oh, that's good.

677
00:40:48,948 --> 00:40:50,882
That's fucking great.

678
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:54,552
[inaudible]

679
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:03,228
Hey, guys, just give me
five minutes with him.

680
00:41:03,262 --> 00:41:05,930
- For what?
- He's worried about his wife.

681
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:07,132
He thinks
I'm sympathetic.

682
00:41:07,166 --> 00:41:08,933
I... I build on that story,

683
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:11,469
it could be something
that puts us over the edge.

684
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:17,675
Sure.

685
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:20,079
Uh, we got, what...
Uh, clothes?

686
00:41:20,112 --> 00:41:22,613
T-shirt? Something, anything.

687
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,515
Yeah.

688
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,918
I need this guy to think
that I'm going to let him

689
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,653
walk out of here.

690
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:32,224
I'll see what I can grab.

691
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:36,694
Visser, just so you know,
after your little chat,

692
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:38,297
I'm pulling the plug.

693
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,598
I'll take whatever
Langley throws at me.

694
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,866
Knock yourself out.

695
00:41:41,899 --> 00:41:43,868
Yes, sir.

696
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,674
[engine powering down]

697
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,279
Why are we descending?

698
00:41:54,313 --> 00:41:56,614
- [Kavinsky] We're going down.
- [Miller] What's happening?

699
00:41:56,647 --> 00:41:58,050
Hey! Hey!

700
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,784
Good news is
we're coming down early.

701
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,686
Bad news:
it's definitely a trap.

702
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,088
[Kavinsky]
Open the fucking door!

703
00:42:03,122 --> 00:42:04,856
Open the fucking door!

704
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,191
[pounding on door]

705
00:42:06,225 --> 00:42:07,725
Open the fucking door!

706
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:10,295
Goddamn it!

707
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:12,131
- Hey, bad idea.
- Fuck!

708
00:42:12,164 --> 00:42:13,798
Are you getting any chatter?

709
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:16,968
I got nothing.

710
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,271
[Reese] Badder news, I thought
we were going to Thailand.

711
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:21,906
I was going to get a massage
and a tom gai soup.

712
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,808
Nothing from Control.

713
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,877
Shit, what do we do?

714
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,601
[chains rattle]

715
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:56,741
You look awful.

716
00:43:07,286 --> 00:43:09,620
Right now she's got two minutes.

717
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:14,093
Easy, easy.

718
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:22,967
I'm going to lift
you up now, okay?

719
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:26,871
[groans]

720
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,891
I get to sit down...

721
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:51,062
so now I have to be your friend?

722
00:43:52,364 --> 00:43:54,899
My colleagues
only want one thing.

723
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:59,036
Give it to them,
and you get out of here.

724
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:00,405
You're done.

725
00:44:05,244 --> 00:44:08,980
Whether you beat me or not,
the answer is the same.

726
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:14,319
Okay, I believe you.

727
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:19,358
I wish it didn't have
to come to this, but...

728
00:44:23,395 --> 00:44:25,397
in that case it's the
only way to get you out.

729
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,399
To Fatima.

730
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:31,336
Let's get you changed.

731
00:44:51,956 --> 00:44:53,824
Okay.

732
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:07,972
Take it.

733
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:10,475
It's the only way
to get you out.

734
00:45:10,509 --> 00:45:13,345
You don't let anybody stop you.
Go, come on.

735
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,216
Take it.

736
00:45:17,249 --> 00:45:19,318
What is that?

737
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:24,389
Jesus fuck! Stay here!

738
00:45:27,426 --> 00:45:29,060
[Visser]
Go.

739
00:45:37,236 --> 00:45:39,770
[panting]

740
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:48,347
[gunshot]

741
00:45:51,483 --> 00:45:53,385
What the fuck did you do?

742
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:56,020
I had to.
He attacked me.

743
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:01,460
Sit down.

744
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:03,961
Sit the fuck down!

745
00:46:07,566 --> 00:46:09,166
Stay here.

746
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:20,512
Fuck it.

747
00:46:20,545 --> 00:46:22,213
Hey, hey, wait,
what are you doing?

748
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,215
- Getting answers!
- No!

749
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:26,884
- Easy, easy.
- What the fuck are you doing?

750
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:28,953
Don't you fucking move.

751
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:31,088
Hey, team, good news.

752
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,823
I found a half a bottle
of tequila.

753
00:46:32,857 --> 00:46:34,326
Why don't we have a drink
and talk this over

754
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:35,560
without the guns?

755
00:46:35,594 --> 00:46:37,194
What the fuck are you doing?

756
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:38,996
You're not authorized
to talk to him.

757
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,866
I have to. I have to.

758
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,201
- No, you don't.
- He knew we were coming.

759
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:45,836
He took down two of our guys,

760
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:48,039
and Control's got
no answers for us.

761
00:46:48,072 --> 00:46:50,074
Now we're stuck in fucking box
with no idea where we're headed.

762
00:46:50,107 --> 00:46:51,610
You are not allowed
to talk to him.

763
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:53,378
Can we break down
the walls here?

764
00:46:53,412 --> 00:46:55,314
I'm noticing a lot
of defensiveness

765
00:46:55,347 --> 00:46:57,014
that's coming through somehow.

766
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:58,949
Maybe it's the guns,
I don't know what it is.

767
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:00,985
But it's aggressive, and I don't
think it's constructive.

768
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:03,422
We need to break through,
and get to the bottom of this.

769
00:47:03,455 --> 00:47:05,256
There's clearly
something wrong here.

770
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,124
We're about to land
God knows fucking where.

771
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,461
For all we know,
this guy is controlling

772
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,028
the whole goddamn thing.

773
00:47:12,331 --> 00:47:14,131
Put it down.

774
00:47:20,539 --> 00:47:24,041
How the fuck was there a weapon
in that stack of clothes?

775
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:26,578
Ask Harris.

776
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:28,647
Don't try that shit.

777
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,214
Those clothes
were all I gave you.

778
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:31,483
It's a convenient story.

779
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:33,284
What are you
trying to pull?

780
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:35,986
You put my life in danger
with your carelessness,

781
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,489
and I had to defend myself.

782
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,090
Guards.

783
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:41,393
I'm detaining you.

784
00:47:41,426 --> 00:47:43,027
Lock her up.

785
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,097
She doesn't get to talk
to anybody, see anybody.

786
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:49,100
She doesn't get released
for any reason.

787
00:47:58,577 --> 00:48:00,945
Looks like we're not
the good guys anymore.

788
00:48:02,012 --> 00:48:03,914
You don't think I put
that gun in there, right?

789
00:48:03,948 --> 00:48:05,216
Don't be a fucking idiot.

790
00:48:05,249 --> 00:48:06,618
Come on, Bill.

791
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:08,219
I think she just sees
herself as a patriot.

792
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:10,354
Took matters
into her own hands.

793
00:48:10,389 --> 00:48:12,323
It's not that simple.

794
00:48:12,356 --> 00:48:13,692
What do you mean?

795
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:15,527
This guy Omar,

796
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,429
he was always going
to leave here in a body bag.

797
00:48:17,462 --> 00:48:19,363
What does that have to do
with her taking matters

798
00:48:19,398 --> 00:48:20,998
into her own hands?

799
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:22,534
She's not going
to do this by herself.

800
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:25,002
There's some bigger picture
we're not seeing.

801
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,505
We got to think smart, buddy,

802
00:48:26,538 --> 00:48:28,272
or we're going to get
run over here.

803
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:32,977
What next?

804
00:48:34,078 --> 00:48:35,580
We get ready.

805
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:43,354
[door slams]

806
00:48:43,387 --> 00:48:45,557
Hey, Miller, I don't think
he's the enemy here.

807
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:48,025
You sure? Because somebody's
been fucking with this op.

808
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:50,629
Yeah, well, it could just
as easily be you, could be me.

809
00:48:50,662 --> 00:48:52,531
Can we talk about it
without shooting each other?

810
00:48:52,564 --> 00:48:55,966
Kavinsky has been getting
unsecured messages.

811
00:48:57,134 --> 00:48:58,335
Really?

812
00:48:58,369 --> 00:48:59,638
Yeah.

813
00:48:59,671 --> 00:49:02,741
That's right. I saw them.

814
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:04,341
I asked him, he denied it.

815
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:06,310
And they're not from Control.

816
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:10,047
- [Reese] Is it true?
- She's right.

817
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,116
[Reese]
Well, that's interesting.

818
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:14,218
I thought I saw you looking
at your phone, you sneaky fuck.

819
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,487
Who sent them?

820
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,589
- I don't know.
- Bullshit!

821
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:20,291
I don't know.
I don't fucking know.

822
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:22,193
Control's been
sending me messages too.

823
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:25,564
They've detected incoming
messages on your line.

824
00:49:25,597 --> 00:49:27,231
They said under no circumstances

825
00:49:27,264 --> 00:49:29,066
am I allowed to let
you talk to the target.

826
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,202
So now you're the one
following orders?

827
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:32,737
That's the whole point,
isn't it?

828
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:35,640
Follow orders.
Keep it simple.

829
00:49:35,674 --> 00:49:37,374
You're the one
who told me that, right?

830
00:49:37,408 --> 00:49:39,109
That is what you said.

831
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:40,712
All right, all right.
I did receive messages.

832
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:42,581
I don't know who from.

833
00:49:42,614 --> 00:49:45,282
I told Control about it,
they told me not to open them.

834
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,552
Why didn't you
tell us sooner?

835
00:49:47,586 --> 00:49:49,621
The same reason you're pointing
a gun at me right now.

836
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:51,288
All I know is
Control and orders,

837
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:53,424
and right now
those two are fucked.

838
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:56,260
When did the messages start?

839
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,262
When we grabbed him.
Everything says we're walking

840
00:49:58,295 --> 00:49:59,631
straight into
a shit storm right now.

841
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,198
Control cut us off.

842
00:50:01,232 --> 00:50:02,767
We have to fucking
question him.

843
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:05,202
Fine. You sit
your ass back down,

844
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:07,806
we let this bird land
and we see what happens.

845
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,340
Yeah, and we walk
straight into an ambush

846
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:10,809
with our pants
around our ankles?

847
00:50:10,842 --> 00:50:12,644
No. No. We open up that message,

848
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:14,445
rip his hood off
and see what's what.

849
00:50:14,478 --> 00:50:16,548
Or you guys could
just shoot each other.

850
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:19,283
No.

851
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:22,019
No, we open the message.

852
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:24,221
[door closes]

853
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:44,643
[camera clicks]

854
00:50:44,676 --> 00:50:48,379
You got it done
in there.

855
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:52,383
Ain't perfect,
but it's done.

856
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:54,619
Just clean enough to tell the
story the bosses want to tell.

857
00:50:54,653 --> 00:50:57,221
All right,
so we stick to the plan

858
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,189
no matter how messy
this gets.

859
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,794
[camera clicks]

860
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:08,098
You sure you don't
want us to do this?

861
00:51:08,132 --> 00:51:09,533
I'm sure.

862
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,202
Okay.

863
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:18,509
Let's move.

864
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:21,378
[camera clicks]

865
00:51:25,617 --> 00:51:27,551
[camera clicking]

866
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:34,759
Okay, wait one second.

867
00:51:34,793 --> 00:51:37,361
Let's talk about this, okay?

868
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,330
You don't want to do it.

869
00:51:44,803 --> 00:51:46,303
Whoever's pulling your strings,

870
00:51:46,337 --> 00:51:48,773
you're as expendable
to them as I am.

871
00:51:48,807 --> 00:51:51,141
No one is pulling
my strings.

872
00:51:51,175 --> 00:51:53,745
Look, you shot a detainee.
I get it.

873
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,479
You're scared.

874
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:57,816
I'm scared.

875
00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:00,584
But if you help me bring in
whoever's running this show,

876
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:03,320
we can get through
this together.

877
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:06,290
I promise you
that goes away.

878
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,425
You shoot a fellow officer...

879
00:52:09,661 --> 00:52:11,796
there's no getting
back from that.

880
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:19,938
All right.

881
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:22,339
Very slowly,
I'm just going to...

882
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:29,648
[gasps softly and grunts]

883
00:52:41,793 --> 00:52:43,662
- [Olsen] Hey.
- Hey.

884
00:52:43,695 --> 00:52:44,963
Come in, please.

885
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:46,865
It's nice in here. It's like a...

886
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:49,600
It's like an episode
of <i>Homeland.</i>

887
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:50,835
You're free to take
a load off, if you want.

888
00:52:50,869 --> 00:52:52,603
I'm all right.

889
00:52:52,636 --> 00:52:54,571
You're not too comfortable
indoors, are you?

890
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:57,441
Well...

891
00:52:57,474 --> 00:53:00,210
You like it out there.
Get your hands dirty, you know?

892
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:01,512
No restraints.

893
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,748
- Yeah.
- I was looking in your file,

894
00:53:03,782 --> 00:53:05,315
seems you went a little rogue

895
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,317
for a while there
in Afghanistan.

896
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:10,855
Well, you know, it's hard
to say no to that many goats.

897
00:53:10,889 --> 00:53:12,757
[chuckles]
I didn't see that coming.

898
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:14,291
Just like the goat, huh?

899
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,559
[laughs]

900
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:16,895
I figured I brought in
the right guy.

901
00:53:16,928 --> 00:53:18,429
- Yeah.
- No restraints.

902
00:53:18,462 --> 00:53:19,898
Want a gig?

903
00:53:19,931 --> 00:53:21,632
Uh, you know what?

904
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:23,300
I'm ready for you.

905
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,335
I've been frying chicken
for Colonel Sanders

906
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:26,705
for the last two years.

907
00:53:26,738 --> 00:53:28,539
Even if they rip
your nails out, right?

908
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:31,508
You'd never divulge the
secret 11 herbs and spices.

909
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,977
Can't talk about that.

910
00:53:33,011 --> 00:53:35,679
There's somebody
you need to meet.

911
00:53:35,714 --> 00:53:37,949
It's not Debbie
from the Beirut desk, is it?

912
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:41,251
Caroline,
could you come in, please?

913
00:53:42,286 --> 00:53:43,988
Toss him the line.

914
00:53:44,022 --> 00:53:46,490
All right, all right.

915
00:53:47,826 --> 00:53:49,560
I'm putting it down.

916
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:02,406
I know that shooter.

917
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:03,875
[whistles]

918
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:06,911
Me too.

919
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:10,347
[Olsen]
Caroline Visser.

920
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:11,850
Reese.

921
00:54:11,883 --> 00:54:15,552
Hey. Reese.
Like the peanut butter cup.

922
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:17,354
Nice to meet you.

923
00:54:18,555 --> 00:54:20,959
She'll be running point
on this op.

924
00:54:20,992 --> 00:54:22,559
That's great.

925
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:24,294
I'm real excited.

926
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:25,930
Yeah.

927
00:54:25,964 --> 00:54:28,800
This is going to be fun.

928
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:30,835
She recruited all three of us,
all for this op.

929
00:54:30,869 --> 00:54:33,037
Yeah, and I guess she wasn't
looking for the A-team either.

930
00:54:33,071 --> 00:54:34,404
No offense.

931
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:36,607
So why? Why us?

932
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:38,943
Yeah, why us?

933
00:54:38,977 --> 00:54:40,979
All right, I received
an unsecured message

934
00:54:41,012 --> 00:54:42,781
on my secure line, right?

935
00:54:42,814 --> 00:54:44,681
Showing our common thread,
Visser killing someone

936
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:46,283
in her own team.

937
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,559
This guy's the source
of the messages.

938
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:01,065
And I think I know
how he's transmitting them.

939
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:13,044
[typing]

940
00:55:19,818 --> 00:55:22,053
[gunshots]

941
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,458
Jesus.

942
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:29,861
[door slams distantly]

943
00:55:46,978 --> 00:55:48,512
[grunts]

944
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,610
We need to free his arms.
That's the usual spot.

945
00:56:20,879 --> 00:56:22,646
Look, it's easier if I show you.

946
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:23,780
Will you just trust me?

947
00:56:23,814 --> 00:56:25,449
All right.

948
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,754
Come on.

949
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:35,492
[sighs]

950
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:36,895
Struck out. Shit.

951
00:56:36,928 --> 00:56:38,897
It's the other one.

952
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:56,780
- He'll live.
- Okay.

953
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:58,782
You take the main exit,
I'll take the back.

954
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:15,599
[Manson]
That's not going to open.

955
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:21,005
Put it on the ground.

956
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:34,953
This was all a sham.

957
00:57:34,986 --> 00:57:37,821
We play a complicated game.

958
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:40,691
Allegiances change.

959
00:57:40,724 --> 00:57:43,894
You and Bill
weren't playing along.

960
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:48,099
What happens to me?

961
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,868
I don't have to
shoot you right here.

962
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:53,237
You play along,

963
00:57:53,271 --> 00:57:56,140
maybe they don't burn you.

964
00:57:56,174 --> 00:58:00,677
Maybe you ought to stick
to being a guard.

965
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:02,113
[chuckles]

966
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:06,550
Yeah, they're not
letting you go.

967
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:09,988
I'm surprised you picked
the obvious exit.

968
00:58:10,021 --> 00:58:13,124
I'm surprised
you fell for it.

969
00:58:13,157 --> 00:58:15,159
What?

970
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,084
[Manson]
I'll go after him.

971
00:58:40,118 --> 00:58:41,551
[Visser]
Let him go. He's burned.

972
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:44,721
[panting]

973
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:46,857
What was he doing
in the surveillance room?

974
00:58:48,026 --> 00:58:50,028
Shit.

975
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,769
- [Reese] What the hell?
- [Miller] That's it.

976
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:01,605
- What?
- Data hold.

977
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:03,607
A thin drive
encased by plastic.

978
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,209
The Russians have been using
a lot lately,

979
00:59:05,243 --> 00:59:07,245
even though it causes
nasty infections.

980
00:59:07,278 --> 00:59:08,912
You know Russia.

981
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:10,214
Oh, God.

982
00:59:10,248 --> 00:59:12,682
Get some penicillin, buddy.

983
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,818
You can program it using
a frequency in a specific range,

984
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:17,321
and then set it
to broadcast on repeat.

985
00:59:17,355 --> 00:59:20,258
All right, why was I the only
one receiving the message?

986
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:22,025
Because it picked up
your device first,

987
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,593
so it must have locked on.

988
00:59:23,627 --> 00:59:26,264
And that's why
he let us catch him.

989
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:29,032
He wanted us to see
that video of Visser.

990
00:59:29,067 --> 00:59:32,702
Shit, I can't even pair
my Bluetooth with my headphones.

991
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:34,272
All right, okay, look,
let's find out why.

992
00:59:34,305 --> 00:59:35,906
Cover him.

993
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:45,715
Okay, you have two guns
on you right now.

994
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:47,984
You do anything
mildly confusing,

995
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:49,886
anything makes me
feel uncomfortable,

996
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,356
you will be shot dead,
do you understand that?

997
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:00,897
Do it.

998
01:00:00,931 --> 01:00:02,599
All right.

999
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:14,811
We're descending.

1000
01:00:17,148 --> 01:00:20,118
Assuming that's not
part of the plan.

1001
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:23,854
We've been in the air
for almost two hours,

1002
01:00:23,887 --> 01:00:25,423
heading in the direction
of Thailand.

1003
01:00:25,456 --> 01:00:26,957
I knew it, I knew it.

1004
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,859
Yeah, it's always Thailand.

1005
01:00:28,892 --> 01:00:31,027
Get away with anything
in Thailand.

1006
01:00:33,864 --> 01:00:35,899
That puts us
over Eastern Europe.

1007
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:39,903
We're going to Kosovo.

1008
01:00:41,272 --> 01:00:42,739
And why?

1009
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,975
Decommissioned black site.

1010
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:46,710
No oversight.

1011
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:48,678
No eyes.

1012
01:00:52,082 --> 01:00:54,218
That's where Visser will be.

1013
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,456
- Shit.
- [Harris] She needs me dead.

1014
01:00:58,489 --> 01:01:00,824
Actually, she needs
all three of you dead.

1015
01:01:00,857 --> 01:01:04,395
You're welcome for taking out
Manson and Bundy, by the way.

1016
01:01:04,428 --> 01:01:06,830
They were going
to kill you in midair.

1017
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:08,932
I... Who are you, all right?

1018
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:11,735
And why are you carrying
that video around in your arm?

1019
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:15,705
I'm just a loose end
she needs to cut off.

1020
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,108
She murdered my friend.

1021
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:19,943
So I let her find me,

1022
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:22,913
took out Manson and Bundy
before they could kill you.

1023
01:01:22,946 --> 01:01:24,748
I can get your eyes
on that video,

1024
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:27,251
then maybe you're down
to help me out,

1025
01:01:27,285 --> 01:01:28,952
so I have a team.

1026
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:31,988
Now here we are.

1027
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:36,260
Then we kill her.

1028
01:01:36,294 --> 01:01:38,229
Aren't you glad
we opened that message?

1029
01:01:38,262 --> 01:01:39,996
You signed our death warrant.

1030
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,831
You were dead the minute
you agreed to this.

1031
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:45,001
You're all military gypsies.
There's no paperwork on you.

1032
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,204
Fuck!

1033
01:01:46,237 --> 01:01:47,938
Her team brought you in,
trained you.

1034
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:50,807
No, it wasn't her team. No.

1035
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:52,809
It was a guy.

1036
01:01:54,312 --> 01:01:57,281
Either way, they will bury you
without a trace.

1037
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:01,151
You're assets, not officers.

1038
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:04,020
And probably with back stories
that make it easy

1039
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,189
to discredit you
if need be.

1040
01:02:06,224 --> 01:02:08,359
[rumbling]

1041
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:10,126
Coming in hot.

1042
01:02:14,097 --> 01:02:15,233
Hey, what do we do?

1043
01:02:15,266 --> 01:02:16,900
Buckle up.

1044
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:18,134
The facts that matter are,

1045
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:20,971
we kill her or she kills us.

1046
01:02:21,004 --> 01:02:23,241
It's that simple.

1047
01:02:23,274 --> 01:02:25,409
Is she going to be on
the ground when we land?

1048
01:02:25,443 --> 01:02:27,378
Without a doubt.

1049
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:30,514
All right.

1050
01:02:30,548 --> 01:02:33,850
We need to make it look like
we never figured it out.

1051
01:02:37,988 --> 01:02:39,423
Good night.

1052
01:02:42,326 --> 01:02:43,860
[Kavinsky]
All right, guys.

1053
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:45,895
I don't know
where the bullets

1054
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,864
are going to be
coming in from,

1055
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:50,100
but I'm with you.

1056
01:02:51,469 --> 01:02:53,437
[sighs]
That's all I got.

1057
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:16,527
[tires squeal]

1058
01:03:33,444 --> 01:03:35,045
[Miller]
Reese.

1059
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:39,082
Here we go.

1060
01:03:42,486 --> 01:03:45,456
What's this?
All right, let's gear up.

1061
01:03:59,537 --> 01:04:01,204
Let's play this out.

1062
01:04:04,442 --> 01:04:06,910
[jet engines powering down]

1063
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,188
[Kavinsky]
Reese, take your six.

1064
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:23,893
[Reese] Hey, guys,
you know "Kosovo"

1065
01:04:23,927 --> 01:04:26,397
means "field of black birds"
in Serbian?

1066
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:27,997
That's kind of cool, right?

1067
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,966
Just like <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

1068
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:31,569
[Miller]
Shut the fuck up, Reese.

1069
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:34,337
You sure you can sort
this all out on your own?

1070
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:37,340
Yes, I'm certain
they haven't even caught on.

1071
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,412
I should have this thing
wrapped up in a few.

1072
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:46,316
If you don't
deal with them quickly,

1073
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:47,685
you're going to find yourself

1074
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:49,953
with a very unpleasant
liability on your hands.

1075
01:04:49,986 --> 01:04:52,021
I have a backup team
inbound to assist.

1076
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:54,090
<i>No one knows how many
hundreds or even thousands</i>

1077
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:56,427
of boys' lives won't have
to be lost in the desert

1078
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,294
because of your work.

1079
01:04:58,328 --> 01:05:00,063
Considering this is
the only thanks

1080
01:05:00,096 --> 01:05:01,998
you'll probably ever get,

1081
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:04,502
I just wanted
to make it personally.

1082
01:05:04,535 --> 01:05:06,136
Thank you, sir.

1083
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:07,904
<i>Thank you.</i>

1084
01:05:14,177 --> 01:05:15,546
[phone beeps]

1085
01:05:26,524 --> 01:05:28,492
[Miller]
Hey, Kavinsky,

1086
01:05:28,526 --> 01:05:30,026
no matter what happens

1087
01:05:30,059 --> 01:05:32,996
don't let Visser
get a hold of your line.

1088
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:36,600
I copy you.

1089
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:41,938
This place is huge.

1090
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:46,176
Where's the welcome wagon?

1091
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,279
[Kavinsky]
Now quiet.

1092
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:51,482
Eyes open.

1093
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:57,420
[door rumbles open]

1094
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,666
[Visser]
Easy. Easy guys.

1095
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:10,366
You're in the clear.

1096
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,335
[Kavinsky] We'll wait
for visual confirmation.

1097
01:06:12,368 --> 01:06:14,672
[Visser] We're secured.
You can holster your weapons.

1098
01:06:14,705 --> 01:06:16,072
- Hold.
- [Visser] Okay.

1099
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:17,508
We'll come to you.

1100
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:19,643
Okay.

1101
01:06:19,677 --> 01:06:23,079
This whole job's
been a little hairy.

1102
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,415
Hairier than your mom's nipples.

1103
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:28,619
But you guys handled it.
Nicely done.

1104
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:31,187
- Is it just you?
- [Visser] You know how it is.

1105
01:06:31,221 --> 01:06:33,089
The fewer people,
the better.

1106
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:35,358
Ex-fil team's on
it's way to take him.

1107
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,427
[Kavinsky]
Yeah, where are we?

1108
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,329
[Visser]
Just sit tight.

1109
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:41,030
They'll be here any second.

1110
01:06:41,064 --> 01:06:42,733
Why'd you go
radio silent on us?

1111
01:06:42,766 --> 01:06:44,400
I couldn't risk
communicating with you

1112
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:46,469
if your line was compromised,
you know that.

1113
01:06:46,504 --> 01:06:47,805
Speaking of your line,

1114
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:49,640
let's take care of that
right now.

1115
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:54,377
- [Kavinsky] Who is he?
- [Visser] No clue.

1116
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,779
They keep us in the dark too.

1117
01:06:55,813 --> 01:06:57,715
So, yeah, like I said,
give me your line

1118
01:06:57,748 --> 01:07:01,785
so my team can run
a diagnostic on it.

1119
01:07:01,819 --> 01:07:03,721
- Want this line? Yeah?
- [Visser] Yeah, that one.

1120
01:07:03,754 --> 01:07:06,456
I can take care of it
right now, no problem.

1121
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:08,091
Wait, stop!

1122
01:07:10,528 --> 01:07:12,061
I mean, if it's compromised
like you're saying,

1123
01:07:12,095 --> 01:07:13,463
I should get rid
of it right now.

1124
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:15,231
- I should destroy it, right?
- Yeah, sure.

1125
01:07:15,265 --> 01:07:18,301
- That's what I should do.
- Go for it.

1126
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:22,505
So now does it matter to you?

1127
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:24,240
[Reese]
I mean, the dick pics

1128
01:07:24,274 --> 01:07:26,075
probably already uploaded
to the cloud,

1129
01:07:26,109 --> 01:07:28,378
so, you know, damage done.

1130
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:31,414
What about those
body bags on the plane?

1131
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:35,285
You are go
for Operation Clean Sweep.

1132
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:38,187
No dust bunnies.

1134
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:44,160
Green light
on Operation Clean Sweep.

1135
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:52,201
We need the floor
completely clean.

1136
01:07:52,235 --> 01:07:53,804
<i>Roger that, sir.</i>

1137
01:07:53,837 --> 01:07:55,405
Good.

1138
01:07:58,141 --> 01:08:00,410
Everyone on the ground
is considered hostile.

1139
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:02,211
No exceptions.

1140
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:08,384
How about those body bags?

1141
01:08:11,454 --> 01:08:13,423
You saw the video.

1142
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,863
You want to know
who this guy is?

1143
01:08:21,865 --> 01:08:24,267
This is a guy who turned
his back on his duty.

1144
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,402
And now he is facing
the consequences.

1145
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:28,404
Do not be like him!

1146
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:30,206
- Do your duty!
- Move, move!

1155
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,294
Yeah, it's nothing.

Whoever's coming
in that bird,

1157
01:09:26,797 --> 01:09:28,598

they're here to help us.

- Wait, what was Plan A?
- Kill Visser.

1165
01:10:05,703 --> 01:10:07,871
It was? But I don't think
we even talked about that.

1166
01:10:07,905 --> 01:10:09,707
So, what's Plan B?

1167
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:11,441
Kill them all.

1168
01:10:11,474 --> 01:10:12,910
Okay, I get
with that plan.

01:14:12,983 --> 01:14:14,884
Get lost.
Maybe you'll get lucky.

1232
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:16,954
She's the only one who knows
about you, you can disappear.

1233
01:14:16,987 --> 01:14:18,854
No, there's another guy
who knows about us too.

1234
01:14:18,888 --> 01:14:20,856
- Let me start with her.
- [Miller] Go.

1235
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:22,491
Go, we'll cover you.

1236

[breathing heavily]

1253
01:16:24,814 --> 01:16:26,782
[Harris] Did you think
that killing two innocent men

1254
01:16:26,816 --> 01:16:28,584
makes you a patriot?

1255
01:16:33,656 --> 01:16:35,925
At least Bill didn't hide!

1256
01:16:43,666 --> 01:16:46,035
[Harris]
How did you go so astray?

1257
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:49,004
Same background as me,
same résumé.

1258
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:59,282
Lined up for a long career
in the service.

1259

- [bullet whizzes and thuds]
- [grunting]

1260
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:06,423
Fuck you!

1261
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:09,758
[Harris] But here you are
killing innocent people.

1262
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:13,095
And here I am,
forced to kill you.

1263

Let's get this over with.

1270
01:17:44,294 --> 01:17:46,263
Shoes off.

1271
01:17:46,296 --> 01:17:47,830
This is not
how I saw this going.

1272
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:49,299
Nice.

1273
01:17:50,367 --> 01:17:51,934
They're expecting five bodies.

1274
01:17:51,967 --> 01:17:53,370
We're gonna give them
a bunch of body parts

1275
01:17:53,403 --> 01:17:54,770
with five pairs of shoes.

1276
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:56,005
Five?

1277
01:17:56,038 --> 01:17:57,940
Visser was never
getting out either.

1278
01:17:57,973 --> 01:17:59,376
Are you sure
this is going to work?

1279
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:01,110
Give me one of those
thermite grenades,

1280
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:03,246
they'll be counting shoes
to figure if we're dead.

1281
01:18:10,187 --> 01:18:11,954
[Kavinsky]
Sending.

1282
01:18:14,957 --> 01:18:16,792

[gunfire and explosions]

1285
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:38,881
What's the verdict, soldier?

[man, on phone]
<i>We took seven KIAs, sir.</i>

1287

Can confirm unknown number
of enemy deceased.

01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:45,322
In English.

1289
01:18:45,355 --> 01:18:46,922
<i>There was an explosion.</i>

1290
01:18:46,956 --> 01:18:48,791
It's impossible
to tell how many died.

1291
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:51,060
We count several types
of shoes in the debris.

1292
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:54,397
<i>My assessment is no survivors.</i>

1293
01:18:54,431 --> 01:18:55,931
Very well, stand by.

1294
01:18:55,965 --> 01:18:57,733

1300
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:19,888
Wait one second, sir.

1301
01:19:23,993 --> 01:19:26,962
Affirmative.
What are the orders?

1302
01:19:26,996 --> 01:19:30,132

Okay, son,
we're good to wrap this up.

1311

Hey, Olsen.

Mr. Deputy Director.

How about some lunch?
