00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:11,843
Ready?

363
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:19,516
[ominous music]

364
00:33:28,492 --> 00:33:30,393
May his fears be exposed

365
00:33:31,229 --> 00:33:33,430
as we have exposed ourselves.

366
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:44,374
May his fears be exposed
as we have exposed ourselves.

367
00:33:45,675 --> 00:33:47,845
As it is in the fire below.

368
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,115
So it is in the heavens above.

369
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:52,716
God of deception.

370
00:33:54,584 --> 00:33:56,154
We worship you.

371
00:33:56,586 --> 00:33:58,122
God of deception.

372
00:33:58,256 --> 00:33:59,857
We worship you.

373
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:04,028
God of deception.

374
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:06,329
We worship you.

377
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:28,718
Honey,

378
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:30,654
are you okay?

379
00:34:32,123 --> 00:34:33,291
I don't know what happened.

380
00:34:33,623 --> 00:34:35,692
[sighs] What was that?

381
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,798
She just really gets to me.

382
00:34:42,532 --> 00:34:44,035
You scared us.

383
00:34:47,972 --> 00:34:49,941
You know I'd never
hurt you, right?

384
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,844
I don't want you hurting
yourself either.

385
00:34:54,946 --> 00:34:55,880
I love you.

386
00:35:11,728 --> 00:35:12,830

[ominous music intensifies]

390
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:15,192
Really?

391
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:18,863
Really?

392
00:36:23,334 --> 00:36:25,002
I'm gettin' a fuckin' drink.

393
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:52,462
Work again, huh?

394
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:57,667
- What do you want me to do?
- Actually open up.

395
00:36:57,802 --> 00:37:01,439
Tell me how I can help. Look, I know
things are bad between you and your mother,

396
00:37:01,604 --> 00:37:05,343
but at some point you
need to move on and get help.

397
00:37:05,943 --> 00:37:09,113
- Or, let me help.
- I just need more time,

398
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:11,983
- please.
- [sighs]

399
00:37:13,284 --> 00:37:14,517
Mm-mm, nah.

00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,802
Yeah?

403
00:37:33,371 --> 00:37:35,306
Sir, Private Brooks is here
to see you.

404
00:37:36,107 --> 00:37:37,808
Tell her to talk
to Sergeant Reeves.

405
00:37:37,942 --> 00:37:40,144
I tried, she really needs
to speak to you, sir.

406
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:50,553
Sit down.

407
00:37:58,295 --> 00:37:59,330
I need to get out.

408
00:37:59,463 --> 00:38:01,032
[eerie music]

409
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:03,000
Dr. Reeves.

410
00:38:03,134 --> 00:38:04,235
Please, sir.

411
00:38:08,705 --> 00:38:10,041
All right.

412
00:38:11,342 --> 00:38:12,709
It'll all be over soon.

413
00:38:14,278 --> 00:38:15,212
What'd you say?

414
00:38:15,578 --> 00:38:16,947
[eerie music]

415
00:38:17,081 --> 00:38:18,681
[Susie]
It will be over soon.

416
00:38:18,816 --> 00:38:20,117
[whispers] Relax.

417
00:38:28,691 --> 00:38:29,794
You need to go.

418
00:38:31,062 --> 00:38:31,962
[smack]

419
00:38:39,602 --> 00:38:41,205

[glass clanking]

425
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:44,168
[Matthew] Honey,
I think someone's in the house.

426
00:39:44,535 --> 00:39:45,635
Stay here.

427
00:39:48,439 --> 00:39:49,340

Matty?

- [ominous musical sting]
- [eerie whispering]

437
00:41:42,653 --> 00:41:44,088
Did you hear that?

438
00:41:45,522 --> 00:41:46,957
Honey, what the hell?

439
00:41:49,827 --> 00:41:50,928
Hey!

440
00:41:51,328 --> 00:41:52,396
Sleep downstairs.

441
00:41:54,865 --> 00:41:55,966
[eerie music]

442
00:41:58,836 --> 00:42:00,337
[eerie whisper]

443
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:17,087
Want to talk about it?

444
00:42:19,823 --> 00:42:21,191
You can't be serious.

445
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:24,261
You ran around this house
last night with a gun,

446
00:42:24,395 --> 00:42:25,896
seeing shit that wasn't there,

447
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,399
and now you want to talk
about it?

448
00:42:29,867 --> 00:42:31,402
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Dawn.

449
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:33,103
I'm going to the gym.

450
00:42:33,537 --> 00:42:34,438
Okay.

451
00:42:38,275 --> 00:42:39,343
[sighs]

452
00:42:45,382 --> 00:42:46,383

[sent chime]

454
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,889
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

455
00:42:52,022 --> 00:42:54,191
Until 1100, you can spend
the day how you want.

456
00:42:54,325 --> 00:42:56,260
If you're religious, there's
a list of the full bulkhead

457
00:42:56,393 --> 00:42:58,929
of services you can attend,
which the Department of Defense

458
00:42:59,063 --> 00:43:01,432
recently expanded to include
new age and Wicca.

459
00:43:01,565 --> 00:43:03,400
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

460
00:43:03,534 --> 00:43:05,770
If you feel left out,
talk to the chaplain.

461
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:07,504
- Say, "Aye, sir."
- Aye, sir.

462
00:43:07,638 --> 00:43:09,606
As you know, all services
are held in the chapel.

463
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,810
From my understanding,
they're still working on diversifying

464
00:43:11,942 --> 00:43:14,078
the religious symbols
in that space.

465
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:16,815
In the meantime,
you have to deal with the cross.

466
00:43:16,947 --> 00:43:18,549
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

467
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:21,552
The Wiccan service at 0800,
all of the services follow.

468
00:43:21,685 --> 00:43:22,886
Any questions?

469
00:43:23,654 --> 00:43:24,555
See you at 11:30.

- [screaming]
- [with demonic voice] Your journal won't help you.

476
00:44:48,238 --> 00:44:50,140
[frightened voice] No, no, no.

477
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:52,409
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

478

00:44:53,845 --> 00:44:56,280
[grunts] Oh, what the fuck?

480
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:57,948
I'm sorry.

481
00:44:58,917 --> 00:45:00,451
You know I'd never put my...

482
00:45:02,887 --> 00:45:03,987
...hands on you.

483
00:45:09,894 --> 00:45:11,361
Senior, what's going on?

484
00:45:13,096 --> 00:45:14,731
Just working
through some things.

485
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,501
Okay.

486
00:45:18,168 --> 00:45:19,269
Decode?

487
00:45:21,238 --> 00:45:22,339
Stuff it all.

488
00:45:25,442 --> 00:45:27,144
You need to talk to somebody?

489
00:45:30,347 --> 00:45:31,515
Where is everyone?

490
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:35,385
Uh, some of the recruits
are at chapel,

491
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:37,688
the other ones
are doing group PT.

492
00:45:40,123 --> 00:45:41,258
Are you okay?

493
00:45:47,765 --> 00:45:48,699
[music fades]

494
00:46:01,144 --> 00:46:02,479
What happened last night?

495
00:46:04,748 --> 00:46:05,649
I have no idea.

496
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:14,725
Hail and welcome.

497
00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:16,627
[all]
Hail and welcome.

498
00:46:21,231 --> 00:46:24,635
Gods and goddesses of our
fathers and mothers be with us.

499
00:46:25,469 --> 00:46:26,169
Guide us

500
00:46:26,737 --> 00:46:28,739
as we seek to maintain
Mother Earth

501
00:46:28,873 --> 00:46:31,542
and to bring about healing
for all humankind.

502
00:46:33,343 --> 00:46:34,444
Please be seated.

503
00:46:37,949 --> 00:46:40,250
We are here today,
expecting forgiveness

504
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:41,819
for the burdens we carry.

505
00:46:42,754 --> 00:46:45,055
The gods are
with us to relieve our guilt.

506
00:46:45,656 --> 00:46:49,493
This is not a place for shame,
judgment, or bitterness.

507
00:46:49,626 --> 00:46:52,629
Here, we offer to our gods
all that holds us back...

508
00:46:52,764 --> 00:46:55,365
- [priestess talks in background]
- [whispers] Who are you looking for?

509
00:46:55,499 --> 00:46:58,235
The old lady who's
answered the phone.

510
00:46:58,937 --> 00:47:00,805
- What lady?
- Nothing.

511
00:47:00,939 --> 00:47:02,774
[priestess]
...by our fathers and mothers.

512
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:04,341
Wanna know what nothing mean.

513
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:07,544
- [priestess] ...is the light...
- She gave me the pendent.

514
00:47:07,678 --> 00:47:09,847
[priestess] ...and peace of
mind, which these candles...

515
00:47:09,981 --> 00:47:11,950
The journal, she's the one
that told me about the journal.

516
00:47:12,082 --> 00:47:17,021
...represent. The white candle
represents peace and purity.

517
00:47:17,521 --> 00:47:23,727
By faith, we light this candle,
knowing our gods hear us.

518
00:47:24,829 --> 00:47:27,397
Will remove our burdens
and strengthen us

519
00:47:27,531 --> 00:47:29,299
to be even better people.

520
00:47:33,604 --> 00:47:35,907
The green candle
represents the Earth.

521
00:47:36,673 --> 00:47:39,443
We are here to be good stewards
of Mother Earth,

522
00:47:40,444 --> 00:47:42,179
she takes care of us.

523
00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:45,148
We must bountifully
take care of her.

524
00:47:47,217 --> 00:47:48,619
As we light this candle,

525
00:47:48,752 --> 00:47:51,254
we are recommitting
ourselves to the Earth.

526
00:47:51,889 --> 00:47:53,690
In doing so, we will be...
[priestess talks in background]

527
00:47:53,825 --> 00:47:56,493
[whispers] I don't have
a good feeling about this.

528
00:47:56,627 --> 00:47:58,428
[whispers] A shame,
now it's too late.

529
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,697
[priestess] Both our
gods and Mother Earth...

530
00:48:00,832 --> 00:48:03,835
- Watch what happens later.
- What?

531
00:48:03,968 --> 00:48:06,136
[priestess talks in background]
...for doing good.

532
00:48:06,269 --> 00:48:10,374
Pay attention to what I'm doing!
This is not a reason for you to relax.

533
00:48:11,174 --> 00:48:12,275
Let us pray.

534
00:48:12,409 --> 00:48:14,211
[eerie music]

535
00:48:16,014 --> 00:48:17,748
What the fuck was that?

536
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,362
- Good morning.
- Good morning, ma'am!

537
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:33,630
Let me see your dog tags.

538
00:48:33,765 --> 00:48:34,832
Aye, ma'am.

539
00:48:36,299 --> 00:48:37,902
Good, you're learning.

540
00:48:38,368 --> 00:48:40,104
- Proud of you.
- Aye, ma'am!

541
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:41,605
Serial number?

542
00:48:41,738 --> 00:48:43,640
092105.

543
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,309
- Creed?
- This is my rifle.

544
00:48:46,443 --> 00:48:49,080
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

545
00:48:49,212 --> 00:48:50,681
My rifle is my best friend.

546
00:48:50,815 --> 00:48:52,850
It is my life
and I must master it as I was...

547
00:48:52,984 --> 00:48:53,951
Good!

548
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:56,954
- Ma'am?
- It's good enough.

549
00:49:01,658 --> 00:49:02,559
Hey,

550
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:04,962
you did a great job.

551
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:07,031
It's okay.

552
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:08,699
I know you know the creed.

553
00:49:14,204 --> 00:49:15,305
You got a minute?

554
00:49:17,075 --> 00:49:17,975
Yeah.

555
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:20,644
Talked to Brooks last night.

556
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:22,579
She told me what happened.

557
00:49:23,881 --> 00:49:24,782
Last night?

558
00:49:26,017 --> 00:49:28,218
That she came off
and tried to seduce me?

559
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:30,755
[Sergeant Reeves]
That's not what she said.

560
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:31,789
[gunshot]

561
00:49:33,057 --> 00:49:34,759
Private down, private down!

562
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,561
Somebody do something!

563
00:49:39,864 --> 00:49:41,565
Senior, senior.

564
00:49:45,435 --> 00:49:46,536
Eyes ahead!

565
00:49:46,904 --> 00:49:48,806
[eerie music]

566
00:50:06,256 --> 00:50:07,624
I'll be in my office.

567
00:50:19,003 --> 00:50:19,904
[knocking]

568
00:50:31,681 --> 00:50:33,416
I think
you need to take a break.

569
00:50:35,253 --> 00:50:36,386
A break from what?

570
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,621
From work.

571
00:50:39,056 --> 00:50:40,158
You're here all the time.

572
00:50:40,892 --> 00:50:42,827
Almost every other department
leans on you for help

573
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,962
'cause they know
you won't say no.

574
00:50:47,865 --> 00:50:50,333
You take leave,
we'll take care of the platoon.

575
00:50:51,334 --> 00:50:53,771
It's the first of its kind,
we got to be careful.

576
00:50:55,639 --> 00:50:56,808
And clear your head.

577
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,376
Clear my...
what are you talking about?

578
00:51:01,478 --> 00:51:02,780
Every recruit just saw you

579
00:51:02,914 --> 00:51:05,116
hold a person
who wasn't fuckin' there!

580
00:51:05,249 --> 00:51:08,385
I just need a little rest, that's
all, Carl, I was up most of the night.

581
00:51:08,652 --> 00:51:10,420
I'm having some family problems.

582
00:51:26,503 --> 00:51:27,604
[eerie music]

583
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:36,080
Don't close the door
on your way out.

584
00:51:49,093 --> 00:51:49,994
[keyboard beeping]

585
00:51:52,362 --> 00:51:53,530

[phone vibrates]

587
00:52:11,548 --> 00:52:13,717
It's been
in our family for years.

588
00:52:20,124 --> 00:52:21,025
It's yours.

589
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:27,798
It means, um,

590
00:52:28,665 --> 00:52:31,568
light, like light of the world.

591
00:52:35,273 --> 00:52:36,774
Your father has one too.

592
00:52:42,612 --> 00:52:44,148
He got his when he was six.

593
00:52:45,182 --> 00:52:46,516
It's part of our religion.

594
00:52:51,521 --> 00:52:52,924
Isn't that why you're here?

595
00:52:55,226 --> 00:52:56,559
To talk about your dad?

596
00:52:57,494 --> 00:52:58,595
What dad?

597
00:53:03,234 --> 00:53:04,869
[ominous music]

[ominous music]

600
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,541
Your father is not
what you think he is.

601
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:48,946
He's dangerous.

602
00:53:49,447 --> 00:53:50,982
And if we don't do
something now...

603
00:53:51,514 --> 00:53:52,883
[dramatic musical sting]

604
00:53:55,719 --> 00:53:57,154
Are you ready to listen now?

605
00:54:05,997 --> 00:54:06,897

[dial tone]

607
00:54:14,637 --> 00:54:16,207
Damn it, Susie,
pick up the phone.

608
00:54:16,974 --> 00:54:17,875
[sighs]

609
00:54:28,386 --> 00:54:29,420
Remember,

610
00:54:29,552 --> 00:54:31,055
you're the hero.

611
00:54:33,824 --> 00:54:35,292
[knocking on door]

00:54:37,727 --> 00:54:38,728
[Matthew]
Open the door!

[ominous music]

615
00:54:44,201 --> 00:54:46,070
- [pounding]
- [Matthew] Open the door!

616
00:54:48,406 --> 00:54:49,639
[Susie]
Just a minute.

617
00:54:57,415 --> 00:54:58,315
Let's go.

618
00:55:00,117 --> 00:55:01,618
Let's go!

619
00:55:14,165 --> 00:55:15,066

- [light knocking]
- [eerie music]

623
00:55:47,597 --> 00:55:50,201
[Matthew] Sweetheart,
all I want is what best for you.

624
00:55:50,334 --> 00:55:51,235
Really?

625
00:55:53,037 --> 00:55:55,039
- Honey.
- All of a sudden you care?

626
00:55:55,172 --> 00:55:57,308
Now you're paying attention?

627
00:55:57,441 --> 00:55:59,310
Come on, I know why you're here.

628
00:56:01,178 --> 00:56:03,581
These stupid pictures
got your attention.

629
00:56:03,713 --> 00:56:04,782
Is that what it takes?

630
00:56:04,915 --> 00:56:06,984
What the fuck is wrong with you?

631
00:56:07,118 --> 00:56:08,018
[smack]

632
00:56:11,822 --> 00:56:14,358
This, this is what we are.

633
00:56:14,492 --> 00:56:15,426
I... I am...

634
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:16,861
Don't you dare touch me.

635
00:56:17,495 --> 00:56:20,097
I deserve that. I wasn't
going through your stuff

636
00:56:20,231 --> 00:56:23,334
trying to find those pictures. I...
I just wanted to surprise you.

637
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:26,070
Hold on a second, please.

638
00:56:36,247 --> 00:56:37,948
[eerie humming]

639
00:56:41,952 --> 00:56:43,420
Grandma told me everything.

640
00:56:43,888 --> 00:56:45,256
What the fuck are you?

641
00:56:46,056 --> 00:56:47,525
Watch your tone, young lady.

642
00:56:47,657 --> 00:56:49,960
- What's going on?
- Your husband's threatening me.

643
00:56:50,094 --> 00:56:51,896
Your daughter's being deceived.

644
00:56:53,264 --> 00:56:54,398
What did you do?

645
00:56:56,433 --> 00:56:57,368
What did you do?

646
00:56:57,501 --> 00:56:58,402
He slapped me.

647
00:57:04,542 --> 00:57:05,442
[engine starts]

648
00:57:10,347 --> 00:57:11,248
[door creaks]

649
00:57:18,889 --> 00:57:19,990
Dawn?

650
00:57:20,858 --> 00:57:23,460
Honey, I'm so sorry
that he slapped you.

651
00:57:24,895 --> 00:57:26,729
There is no excuse.

652
00:57:31,268 --> 00:57:32,236
[car approaching]

[engine cuts]

654
00:57:43,147 --> 00:57:44,982
Maria and I appreciate
you coming forward,

655
00:57:45,115 --> 00:57:47,750
no one likes this,
but it had to be done.

656
00:57:47,885 --> 00:57:48,953
It was not easy.

657
00:57:49,086 --> 00:57:50,187
[ominous music]

658
00:57:51,322 --> 00:57:52,223
Sergeant major?

659
00:57:54,592 --> 00:57:55,492
How are you doing?

660
00:57:58,829 --> 00:57:59,930
Fine.

661
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:02,732
Are you sure?

662
00:58:07,037 --> 00:58:09,006
- Can we talk about this privately?
- No.

663
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:14,278
Okay.

664
00:58:14,778 --> 00:58:15,946
I'm listening.

665
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,381
Is it all true?

666
00:58:18,048 --> 00:58:18,949
I don't know.

667
00:58:19,283 --> 00:58:21,085
But come on, let's go find out.

668
00:58:21,218 --> 00:58:23,754
Some 15 years
of honorable service.

669
00:58:24,188 --> 00:58:26,323
No one can do what I do here.
No one.

670
00:58:26,457 --> 00:58:28,959
I wouldn't throw it all
the way for a piece of ass.

671
00:58:29,693 --> 00:58:31,161
Did you know about this?

672
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:34,098
I tried to talk to you.

673
00:58:34,531 --> 00:58:37,268
She has scratches
on her arms and legs, Matthew.

674
00:58:37,935 --> 00:58:39,536
[dark music]

675
00:58:48,479 --> 00:58:49,446
Check in the drawer.

676
00:59:07,131 --> 00:59:10,367
You need to take a leave of absence
while an investigation occurs.

677
00:59:11,635 --> 00:59:13,804
You cannot interact
with any of your recruits

678
00:59:13,937 --> 00:59:16,740
or come back on base until
the investigation is complete

679
00:59:16,874 --> 00:59:18,909
and your name hopefully cleared.

680
00:59:19,043 --> 00:59:20,811
You'll be required to submit
a statement.

681
00:59:20,944 --> 00:59:22,379
Someone will be in touch.

682
00:59:23,714 --> 00:59:24,948
It's time for you to go.

683
00:59:26,984 --> 00:59:28,552
I'll gather some of my things.

684
00:59:33,090 --> 00:59:34,491
Sergeant Blanchard?

685
00:59:37,995 --> 00:59:39,296
Is this what you want?

686
00:59:40,464 --> 00:59:41,398
[ominous music]

687
00:59:47,304 --> 00:59:48,639
[Jessica]
I don't want you

688
00:59:48,773 --> 00:59:50,974
around my husband
nor my daughter.

689
00:59:51,308 --> 00:59:54,311
Don't call, don't come around.

690
00:59:54,978 --> 00:59:56,380
Leave us the hell alone.

691
01:00:01,652 --> 01:00:02,986
Did you tell your mother...

692
01:00:07,591 --> 01:00:09,927
...that you have
a noose in your drawer

693
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,495
and you want to hurt yourself?

694
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:15,899
And that I talked you out of it.

695
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:19,603
Tell her.

696
01:00:23,507 --> 01:00:25,542
[clicks tongue]
Come on. Let's go.

697
01:00:25,676 --> 01:00:26,577
Mom.

698
01:00:28,612 --> 01:00:29,513
It's true.

699
01:00:31,882 --> 01:00:32,983
What?

700
01:00:52,536 --> 01:00:53,537
I know it's hard,

701
01:00:54,972 --> 01:00:56,673
but I need you to trust me.

702
01:00:59,109 --> 01:01:02,346
I talked to Dawn
because she can help us.

703
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,214
She knows everything.

704
01:01:06,450 --> 01:01:08,485
We just need you to believe.

01:01:13,792 --> 01:01:14,691
[eerie music]

706
01:01:27,938 --> 01:01:29,673
There are only
two keys like this

707
01:01:30,374 --> 01:01:32,409
and Matthew has the other one.

708
01:01:33,677 --> 01:01:36,848
When you find the right book,
use this key.

709
01:01:37,314 --> 01:01:39,918
Look at shoe boxes,
he always hid things there.

710
01:01:40,484 --> 01:01:43,153
That book is
all you need to know.

711
01:01:43,654 --> 01:01:44,988
What?

712
01:01:45,122 --> 01:01:49,159
Listen,
the next time you see him,

713
01:01:49,928 --> 01:01:51,094
give him this.

714
01:01:52,196 --> 01:01:55,232
If it turns black, leave.

01:04:02,492 --> 01:04:05,930
<i>Apparently there's
a grace period, till I'm 35.</i>

726
01:04:06,496 --> 01:04:09,199
<i>If I don't convert by then,
I'm told the demon</i>

727
01:04:09,333 --> 01:04:12,269
<i>will haunt Susie like prey
because she failed to bring in</i>

728
01:04:12,402 --> 01:04:14,038
<i>another convert into the coven.</i>

729
01:04:14,171 --> 01:04:16,707
<i>That's why she's after me.
She wants to kill me</i>

730
01:04:16,841 --> 01:04:18,776
<i>before Dollas kills her.</i>

731
01:04:20,912 --> 01:04:22,512
<i>When I get angry,
I feel him most.</i>

732
01:04:22,847 --> 01:04:24,748
<i>Mom told me he's controlled
by violence,</i>

733
01:04:24,882 --> 01:04:26,516
<i>sometimes willpower.</i>

734
01:04:26,918 --> 01:04:28,185
<i>She never meant to tell me that.</i>

735
01:04:28,585 --> 01:04:30,420
<i>I guess she had
a moment of conscience.</i>

736
01:04:31,055 --> 01:04:34,558
<i>This is my secret. The corps,
my wife, my daughter, no one knows.</i>

737
01:04:34,691 --> 01:04:37,561
- Fuck.

Did you do this to him?

743
01:05:05,255 --> 01:05:06,523
<i>That's irrelevant.</i>

744
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:09,159
Don't tell me what's relevant.

745
01:05:09,292 --> 01:05:11,728
Did you put
a demon in my husband?

746
01:05:12,329 --> 01:05:13,865
<i>Technically, no.</i>

747
01:05:15,033 --> 01:05:15,933
What do we do?

748
01:05:16,533 --> 01:05:17,835

01:09:38,561 --> 01:09:40,865
What's dragon's blood?

810
01:09:42,867 --> 01:09:44,534
That's for exorcisms.

811
01:09:47,805 --> 01:09:49,739
I'll, uh, I'll need that...

812
01:09:51,574 --> 01:09:52,910
...and these items too.

813
01:09:56,347 --> 01:09:57,949
You'll find the sage down there.

Let me see your hands.

823
01:11:33,511 --> 01:11:35,179
I think this was a mistake.

824
01:11:36,047 --> 01:11:37,415
It's your mother, isn't it?

825
01:11:37,782 --> 01:11:38,983
You blame her?

826
01:11:53,563 --> 01:11:55,299
Let me see your hands.

827
01:12:02,907 --> 01:12:06,676
The lines in your
hands tell a story.

828
01:12:09,847 --> 01:12:12,183
What kind of life you've led.

829
01:12:12,883 --> 01:12:15,052
Where you might be going.

830
01:12:18,856 --> 01:12:20,858
When you're going to die.

831
01:12:27,498 --> 01:12:29,166
Put it in your case.

832
01:12:36,673 --> 01:12:39,276
Who's tried to kill you?

833
01:12:45,149 --> 01:12:48,352
Our spirits lived in the realm.

834
01:12:48,685 --> 01:12:50,154
We cannot see.

835
01:12:51,956 --> 01:12:54,925
Joined by the gods
of this world...

836
01:12:55,426 --> 01:13:02,533
[yells] ...who can inhabit
our bodies to communicate.

837
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:09,739
Come now, come now!

838
01:13:16,547 --> 01:13:20,151
I see the Manifest.

839
01:13:21,252 --> 01:13:27,291
Your job, your family ruined,
all ruined.

840
01:13:31,028 --> 01:13:33,030
But that's just a diversion.

841
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,701
You have a secret.

842
01:13:41,472 --> 01:13:44,041
It's not just you in there.

843
01:13:46,777 --> 01:13:48,646
He wants to take over.

844
01:13:48,779 --> 01:13:54,652

[door creaks]

856
01:15:13,530 --> 01:15:16,834
My son just left his receipt in here
and he asked me to get it for him.

857
01:15:17,401 --> 01:15:19,970
Uh, uh, okay.

858
01:15:31,715 --> 01:15:33,217

01:15:38,989 --> 01:15:40,157
It's what we thought.

01:16:44,855 --> 01:16:46,924
Blessed be above all others.

865
01:16:48,092 --> 01:16:49,560
Keep me from disaster.

866
01:16:50,094 --> 01:16:51,796
Help me in times of calamity.

867
01:16:52,129 --> 01:16:53,664
Still my fears.

868
01:16:53,964 --> 01:16:55,199
See to it that...

869
01:16:59,703 --> 01:17:00,604
[mumbles]

870
01:17:09,713 --> 01:17:11,215
God, can you hear me?

871
01:17:12,649 --> 01:17:15,986
Help me, please.

872
01:17:21,725 --> 01:17:22,526

[door creaks]

01:17:39,576 --> 01:17:41,512
Oh, Dollas.

877
01:17:42,746 --> 01:17:44,248
Hear my prayer.

878
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,518
Forsake me not.

879
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:51,155
Forgive my transgressions.

880
01:17:51,989 --> 01:17:55,959
Renew my spirit!

881
01:17:58,362 --> 01:17:59,596
[unsteady breathing]

882
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:08,005
You wanted to see me?

883
01:18:09,273 --> 01:18:10,374
It didn't work.

884
01:18:18,315 --> 01:18:20,551
I used the candles,
I lit the sage,

885
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:22,586
why didn't it work?

886
01:18:23,888 --> 01:18:25,088
You read the note.

887
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:29,026
Permission to speak freely?

888
01:18:32,596 --> 01:18:33,497
Yeah.

889
01:18:35,566 --> 01:18:36,467
You need faith.

890
01:18:39,002 --> 01:18:41,873
You don't seem like
the kind of person who has it,

891
01:18:42,005 --> 01:18:46,076
but if you want any of this
to work, you have to believe.

892
01:18:47,779 --> 01:18:50,414
In what, ghosts and goblins?

893
01:18:51,248 --> 01:18:53,283
I know this shit is real.

894
01:18:53,952 --> 01:18:56,053
- I didn't mean to offend you.
- You didn't offend me,

895
01:18:56,186 --> 01:18:58,288
just say something that makes
some damn sense.

896
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:05,162
Maybe I didn't
get the right things.

897
01:19:06,296 --> 01:19:08,065
Everything's here. Um.

898
01:19:09,566 --> 01:19:10,167
Spell book.

899
01:19:10,300 --> 01:19:11,702
[eerie music]

900
01:19:13,470 --> 01:19:16,273
Onyx, that wasn't on the list.

901
01:19:19,142 --> 01:19:20,244
It's quartz.

902
01:19:25,249 --> 01:19:27,117
[priest]
You could have avoided this.

903
01:19:27,751 --> 01:19:30,687
All your son needed to do
was convert.

904
01:19:32,022 --> 01:19:34,091
Now the blood is on your hands.

905
01:19:35,225 --> 01:19:37,127
So you're in danger.
The quartz turned black

906
01:19:37,261 --> 01:19:39,329
because the demon
is taking over your body

907
01:19:39,463 --> 01:19:41,565
and it will kill
anyone who gets in its way.

908
01:19:42,099 --> 01:19:47,671
In this hour I call upon you,
god of the shadows,

909
01:19:48,505 --> 01:19:51,074
cast her spirit
into utter darkness

910
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:53,811
and bind together with her.

911
01:19:54,711 --> 01:19:57,247
Okay, we need, we need
to get blood from your thighs.

912
01:19:59,149 --> 01:20:04,187
Empty this rotting body
and breathe new life into her.

913
01:20:07,524 --> 01:20:09,092
It signifies new birth.

914
01:20:09,459 --> 01:20:13,397
The same spirit that entered you will
be the same spirit that leaves you.

915
01:20:15,132 --> 01:20:16,034
Get on.

916
01:20:16,968 --> 01:20:22,139
May this, your covenant,
be ratified in blood.

917
01:20:30,848 --> 01:20:32,182
[music intensifies]

918
01:20:33,818 --> 01:20:36,620
[yells] Now answer me!

919
01:20:36,753 --> 01:20:39,623
[yells] I am the answer!

920
01:20:40,858 --> 01:20:42,192
[eerie whispers]

921
01:20:56,841 --> 01:20:57,741
You ready?

922
01:21:07,018 --> 01:21:08,452
God of deception,

923
01:21:09,186 --> 01:21:10,687
ruler of our coven,

924
01:21:11,055 --> 01:21:12,422
we call on you.

925
01:21:12,890 --> 01:21:14,025
[eerie whispers]

926
01:21:14,792 --> 01:21:17,394
Father of shadows,
we beseech you.

927
01:21:18,261 --> 01:21:20,230
Remove your son from this cross.

928
01:21:20,932 --> 01:21:23,734
I command you
to depart from this man.

929
01:21:24,301 --> 01:21:26,871
Loose his chains, restore to him

930
01:21:27,005 --> 01:21:29,040
all he feared he would lose!

931
01:21:29,172 --> 01:21:32,743
[yells] Get me off this cross!

932
01:21:33,543 --> 01:21:35,545
- [eerie music]
- [screams]

933
01:21:36,114 --> 01:21:37,581
[muffled screams]

934
01:21:38,215 --> 01:21:40,150
[Matthew]
Mm, your letters.

935
01:21:40,885 --> 01:21:43,453
Did you think the Marines
would absolve the guilt you feel

936
01:21:43,587 --> 01:21:45,123
from being raped by your father?

937
01:21:45,389 --> 01:21:46,289
[muffled screams]

938
01:21:46,423 --> 01:21:48,325
- Only death can.
- No!

939
01:21:49,459 --> 01:21:51,428
- [Matthew] Now take it.
- No!

940
01:21:52,262 --> 01:21:53,798
[eerie dramatic music]

941
01:22:02,472 --> 01:22:04,341
[ominous music]

942
01:22:22,392 --> 01:22:24,194
What did you do in here?

943
01:22:33,704 --> 01:22:35,639
I don't like this
when I was a kid,

944
01:22:38,275 --> 01:22:39,576
Mom gave it to me.

945
01:22:43,915 --> 01:22:46,550
She used it to distract me
from what was coming.

946
01:22:50,955 --> 01:22:51,856
Sir?

947
01:22:57,427 --> 01:22:58,863
Do you know my mother?

948
01:23:00,832 --> 01:23:02,666
She gave you a job, didn't she?

949
01:23:04,802 --> 01:23:06,971
To make my life a living hell.

950
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:12,642
To distract me
from what was coming.

951
01:23:17,215 --> 01:23:18,381
My death.

952
01:23:19,951 --> 01:23:22,854
Go like this, ah.

953
01:23:29,292 --> 01:23:30,762
- [scuffling]
- [smothered snap]

954
01:23:30,895 --> 01:23:31,829

[quartz clattering]

957
01:23:55,953 --> 01:23:58,688
- [terrifying music]
- [screams]

958
01:24:01,424 --> 01:24:03,527
- [doors slams]
- [Jessica] No, please!

959
01:24:06,164 --> 01:24:07,464
- Let me in!
- Aah!

960
01:24:08,732 --> 01:24:10,067
- [doorknob jiggling]
- [Matthew] Let me in!

961
01:24:10,201 --> 01:24:12,103
[operator]
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

962
01:24:12,236 --> 01:24:13,403
My father's gone crazy.

963
01:24:13,537 --> 01:24:14,671
I think he's trying to kill us.

964
01:24:14,806 --> 01:24:15,973
[Matthew]
Let me in!

965
01:24:16,107 --> 01:24:17,008
[pounding]

966
01:24:23,080 --> 01:24:26,017
[operator] <i>...patrol is in your area.
Are you somewhere safe?</i>

967
01:24:28,820 --> 01:24:30,087
<i>Please stay on the phone.</i>

968
01:24:30,654 --> 01:24:32,455
[tense music]

969
01:24:37,929 --> 01:24:39,629
Shit, shit!

970
01:24:45,303 --> 01:24:46,871
[heavy breathing]

971
01:24:51,341 --> 01:24:52,442
[eerie music]

972
01:24:55,213 --> 01:24:56,746
[Jessica screams]

973

[thudding]

974
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,856

01:25:08,358 --> 01:25:09,659
[door creaks]

977
01:25:42,326 --> 01:25:43,895
[music intensifies]

978
01:25:44,494 --> 01:25:46,097
[yells] Mom!

979
01:26:16,593 --> 01:26:18,561
[eerie humming]

Mother!

983

[door slams]

984
01:26:54,832 --> 01:26:56,133
[dramatic musical sting]

985
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:08,980

986
01:27:19,423 --> 01:27:20,958
[Susie]
Matthew.

987
01:27:24,095 --> 01:27:25,763
[eerie whispers]

988
01:27:31,202 --> 01:27:32,336
Hello, Mommy.

989
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:34,038
[dramatic music]

990
01:27:34,972 --> 01:27:35,806

[thud]

992
01:27:40,778 --> 01:27:42,813
Stay down, Dollas.

993
01:27:48,419 --> 01:27:49,519
[eerie whispers]

994
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:56,693
This is my covenant,

995
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,997
satisfied by the blood.

996
01:28:06,871 --> 01:28:07,972
[eerie music]

997
01:28:08,605 --> 01:28:10,007

1006
01:29:22,847 --> 01:29:24,348
[Matthew]
This won't work.

1007
01:29:25,416 --> 01:29:27,985
The bullets are covered
in my blood.

1008
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:35,692
- It's over!
- [gunshot]

1009
01:29:35,826 --> 01:29:36,827
