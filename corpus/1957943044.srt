1
00:00:12,647 --> 00:00:14,281
(crickets chirping)

2
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,518
(deep tense music)

3
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,692
(dogs barking in distance)

4
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:31,198
(slow eerie music)

5
00:00:42,677 --> 00:00:44,344
- [Vivian] Don't worry, Zach.

6
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,714
(slow mysterious lullaby music)

7
00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,827
(Zach coos)

8
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,730
See, Zach, everything's okay.

9
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,732
Yeah.

10
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,768
(slow mysterious music)

11
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:19,747
Sh, sh-sh.

12
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,665
(glass shatters)

13
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,767
Aaron?

14
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,135
(glass shatters)

15
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,638
- [Aaron] Almost done.

16
00:01:43,671 --> 00:01:45,305
(slow mysterious music)

17
00:01:57,852 --> 00:01:59,520
(creature growls)

18
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,266
(slashing) (Zach
squeals, cries)

19
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,808
(mirror shatters)
(haunting music)

20
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:33,320
- Zach?

21
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:35,823
(gasps)

22
00:02:36,124 --> 00:02:37,759
Oh, god.

23
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,397
No! (sobbing)

24
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,834
No! (screaming)

25
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:53,574
(gentle mysterious
lullaby music)

26
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:00,247
(creaking)

27
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,931
(Papo cooing)

28
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,544
- [John] Opa.

29
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:31,646
Oh, yeah.

30
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,016
Okay. Hey.

31
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,652
- [Rachel] There it
is, my little prince,

32
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,319
it's your kingdom.

33
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,789
Here we go.

34
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:43,457
(gentle inspiring music)

35
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:58,906
Hey, buddy, this is your room.

36
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:02,977
Hm.

37
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:05,378
(Eli cooing)

38
00:04:06,114 --> 00:04:08,649
Yeah, these are all
your new friends.

39
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,954
You gonna say, "Hello, jaguar.

40
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,423
Hello, alligator.

41
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:20,027
Hello, giraffe."

42
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,262
Oy.

43
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:28,536
Asleep.

44
00:04:30,972 --> 00:04:33,508
- You ever have one
of those moments,

45
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,009
just like you imagined it?

46
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,478
(knocking at door)

47
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,083
- This little kid
sleeps through anything.

48
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,785
(chuckles)

49
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:51,324
(cooing)

50
00:04:52,894 --> 00:04:54,962
- Hi, uh, Schoenberg?

51
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,898
- It's Guerrero.

52
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,700
Ah, yeah.

53
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:01,836
It's my mother-in-law,
that explains it.

54
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,838
Schoenberg's my wife's
maiden name. I can sign.

55
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,472
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

56
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:07,708
- There you go.
- Great. Thank you.

57
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,777
- Oh.

58
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:11,444
All right.

59
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:18,085
Hey, Papo, wanna
say hi to baby Eli?

60
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:21,088
Hey, Papo, look.

61
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,356
It's your little brother.

62
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,859
Yeah.

63
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:26,527
That's Eli.

64
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:28,963
We gotta look after him, yeah.

65
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,898
- It was my sister's stuff.

66
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:33,801
- Toys that, uh,

67
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,003
belonged to a baby who...

68
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,607
- Who died.

69
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,742
- I'm not superstitious,
I'm just saying.

70
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:43,711
You know, what
happened to her son,

71
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:45,880
and the whole accident
with her husband.

72
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:48,448
(Papo squawks) (Eli cries)

73
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,483
What happened? Papo
scare you, huh?

74
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:53,621
Oh, come on, let's get you
over here, put you down.

75
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,488
Okay? Yeah.

76
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:57,124
(Eli cooing)

77
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:58,826
(ticking clock echoes)

78
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,661
Papo's a friend, Eli.

79
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:02,129
It's okay. (Eli coos)

80
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:04,131
Yeah, it's all right, buddy.

81
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,399
(book creaks)

82
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,505
(ticking clock slows down)

83
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,015
- Got your ear.
- Oh, my god.

84
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,783
- And I

85
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:24,451
got your nose.

86
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:28,556
- Look at this.

87
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,758
It's got writing on it.

88
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,661
It's got music.

89
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:36,764
It's Hebrew.

90
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,533
All right, Hebrew school,
let's put you to work.

91
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:42,136
(John chuckles)
- Got jokes, all right.

92
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,105
- Yeah, come on.
See what you got.

93
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,806
- Um...

94
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,442
(John speaks Hebrew)

95
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:54,115
It's like a prayer, but not.

96
00:06:54,148 --> 00:06:55,583
Hm.

97
00:06:55,616 --> 00:06:58,219
Hang on, I got-I got
something for that.

98
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,921
(Papo squawking)

99
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:01,822
- That's good.

100
00:07:01,856 --> 00:07:03,691
You need a cheat sheet.

101
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:05,726
See, you probably don't
even speak Hebrew.

102
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,161
I think I need to
call my mother.

103
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:10,064
- Wow, wow, I mean, I think
what you mean to say is

104
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:12,667
thank you, my love, for
getting my mother off our backs

105
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,069
and proving your undying
love for me and Judaism

106
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,704
by converting, maybe?

107
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,739
- Thank you, my love.
- Mm-hm.

108
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:20,741
- What was it again?
- Mm-hm.

109
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:23,577
Ah, look, here it is.

110
00:07:23,611 --> 00:07:25,079
It's a zemer. Yeah.

111
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,647
- Right.

112
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:28,082
(clears throat) It's a zemer.

113
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:32,820
- Mm-hm, zemer, it's like
a hymn, a religious song,

114
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,588
also like a lullaby.

115
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,525
It's actually beautiful.

116
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:40,161
- It's classic Vivian.

117
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:43,564
- Can you make out the tune?

118
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,133
- Um...

119
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:48,836
(Rachel vocalizing)

120
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:00,247
(telephone rings)

121
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,185
Okay, we don't need a lullaby.

122
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,486
(telephone rings)

123
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:08,756
Hello.

124
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,091
Thank you.

125
00:08:10,124 --> 00:08:12,693
Yeah, he came out so
cute, the little munchkin.

126
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:14,161
I can't even tell you,

127
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:15,963
he's like a perfect
little soufflé.

128
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:18,666
Um, hey, so, right...

129
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,134
Where are we on reservations?

130
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,836
(gentle somber music)

131
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:27,108
You think this is too easy?

132
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,211
- We got this.

133
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,916
- You know, I bet I won't
even need the full month.

134
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,829
(Eli crying)

135
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,235
- Oh.

136
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:55,936
(Eli crying)

137
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,839
(car horns honk)

138
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,941
(Eli crying)

139
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:05,880
- Please, Eli, just work it out.

140
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,315
- Okay, I'll take him so
you can, uh, get ready.

141
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:09,683
Come on, buddy.

142
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,318
I'm, oh, let me get this first.

143
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:13,287
- I know. I know.
- There we go.

144
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,189
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

145
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,957
All right now.

146
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,626
(Eli crying)

147
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,662
- Yeah.
- I can't do this.

148
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,798
I can't... Look at me,
I'm a freaking mess.

149
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:26,901
I can't, I can't, I
can't go in like this.

150
00:09:27,168 --> 00:09:30,604
I've had, what, 45
minutes sleep this week?

151
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:33,007
- Okay, all right.
- I can't, I can't do it.

152
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,675
- How can I help?

153
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:39,180
- I don't know. The
restaurant was also my baby.

154
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:40,848
(Eli fussing)

155
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,319
I just feel like it's
slipping through my fingers.

156
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,021
(Eli fussing)

157
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:49,223
- Okay. (Eli coughing)

158
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,691
Okay. Okay. Up, up.

159
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,159
- Oh.
- Up, up, up.

160
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:53,828
- Hey.
- Rach, love,

161
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:57,064
I saw you build that
restaurant, okay?

162
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,699
- Yeah.

163
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,202
- It's not going anywhere, okay?

164
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:02,937
- I know.
- You're amazing.

165
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,739
- Well, I'm amazing at that
'cause I know how to do it.

166
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,341
I just, I don't
know how to do this

167
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,743
and that at the same time.

168
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,912
(Eli fussing)

169
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:14,982
- I have no doubt.

170
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:16,984
(Rachel sighs)

171
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,652
Oh.

172
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:22,356
Okay, look, um, I'll
call the gallery.

173
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,425
I'll tell the guys,
oh, you got my...

174
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,993
Did you get my nose now?

175
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:27,737
I'll let them know that
I'm gonna stay home.

176
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,106
- I'm not even gonna...
- It'll be me and you.

177
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,965
- No. No.
- Yeah, me and Eli.

178
00:10:30,998 --> 00:10:32,266
- No, no, you can't.

179
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,768
This is your biggest
exhibition ever, baby.

180
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:35,836
- Oh. (Eli cries)

181
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,271
- You gotta go to the gallery

182
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,074
and make sure your psychedelic
chicken is on point.

183
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:42,710
- It's a phoenix.

184
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,422
- Well, you know,
at least one of us

185
00:10:45,446 --> 00:10:47,681
can rise from the
ashes. (John chuckles)

186
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:49,016
I'm gonna stay with you.

187
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,727
- We're gonna work it out.
- Yeah? You sure?

188
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,229
- I got pretty close to getting
out the door today, buddy.

189
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:54,097
- You did. You certainly did.
- I did. I got close.

190
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:55,456
- I did.
- You'll need that.

191
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,758
- We're gonna work
it out, buddy.

192
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,060
Get outta here. Get out
before it's too late.

193
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:01,328
- Okay.
- Hi.

194
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:03,864

we a team, we a team.

195
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:06,133

Yeah, we totally a team.

196
00:11:06,167 --> 00:11:07,835
We got it. Oh, god.

197
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,303
(Eli crying) Yeah.

198
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,339
I, uh, I thought we
agreed on white truffles.

199
00:11:12,373 --> 00:11:14,008
<i>- [Woman On Phone] What?</i>

200
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,276
- On white truffles. Sh, sh.

201
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:18,279
Yep, but you're
still gonna sit down.

202
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:19,947
You can cry about it.

203
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,183
Hi. Hey, baby.

204
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:25,853
Oh, this one, oh, look,
it's fun, it's fun.

205
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,354
Be happy. (Eli cries)

206
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,358
Look, look at the bird.

207
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:33,861
Look at the bird. Yeah.

208
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,763
(Papo squawks)

209
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,865
(Eli cries)

210
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:43,170
It's okay.

211
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:44,338
Look. (clapping)

212
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,941
You wanna clap?
You wanna do this?

213
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:49,511
I just need five minutes, okay?

214
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:51,111
Okay?

215
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:53,447
You're a good guy. Yeah.

216
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,216
You're a good guy.

217
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:56,784
(Eli cries)

218
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:59,320
Please, I just need to poop.

219
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:01,288
Eli.

220
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:02,957
(Eli cries)

221
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,862
No, don't eat that,
don't eat that.

222
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,298
No, don't eat that. No.

223
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,367
That's right.

224
00:12:13,702 --> 00:12:15,402
We're gonna... Oh.

225
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:18,405
Okay.

226
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,307
Okay, we've got this.

227
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,476
Clean?

228
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,812
Vivian, Vivian. Vivian?

229
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,248
Oh, Vivian.

230
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,184
Thank you, sis.

231
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:31,785
Gold up in here. (Eli cries)

232
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:33,254
There's some gold up in here.

233
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,055
What is that?
Look, what's that?

234
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,524
(Eli wailing)

235
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,860
(wailing continues)

236
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,304
Stopped crying.

237
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,806
It works.

238
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,308
(Eli fusses)

239
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:57,011
Is that a little bit of drool?

240
00:12:59,614 --> 00:13:01,448
(foot thuds)

241
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:04,251
(soft eerie music)

242
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,961
(indistinct distant whispering)

243
00:13:23,337 --> 00:13:24,972
Oh...

244
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,440
Johnny.

245
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,108

(Eli crying)

248
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:38,520
Sh, sh, sh.

249
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:41,188
(Eli crying)

250
00:13:48,462 --> 00:13:50,097
(Rachel sings softly)

251
00:13:53,434 --> 00:13:55,069
(Eli stops crying)

252
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,207
(Eli cries)

253
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:05,112

(crickets chirping)

259
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,462
Baby,

260
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,297
you did it.

261
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,034
I love you so much.

262
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,579
(wind howling)

263
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:16,250
(ghostly voices whisper)

264
00:15:20,454 --> 00:15:22,055
(door latch opens)

265
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:23,591
(John sighs)

266
00:15:30,598 --> 00:15:32,433
Hey, honey.

267
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,068
Can you hear that?

268
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:40,073
- I hear...

269
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:42,409
absolutely nothing.

270
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:43,678
- Not a peep.

271
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:45,479
Not a snort.

272
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:48,282
Not for hours.

273
00:15:49,517 --> 00:15:51,118
(John sighs)

274
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,587
It was the lullaby.

275
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,722
- Ah, your, uh,
your sister's book.

276
00:15:54,756 --> 00:15:56,256
- Mm-hm.

277
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,192
- So, you were able to
read my translations?

278
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,594
- Mm-hm.

279
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:03,096
It, I don't know, it
put him right to sleep.

280
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:05,265
(both sigh)

281
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:07,769
- Thank you.

282
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:11,138
- How is this even possible?
You just got in the door.

283
00:16:11,773 --> 00:16:14,107
- Ah, baby puke.

284
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:16,376
It's inevitable.

285
00:16:18,613 --> 00:16:20,247
(towel snaps)

286
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:23,785
Hmm.

287
00:16:23,818 --> 00:16:25,486

(zipper opens)

289
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:34,428
Oh, uh, your dress is unzipped.

290
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,096
- Really?

291
00:16:36,631 --> 00:16:38,265
Oops.

292
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:42,302

306
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,646
John?

Great. (mirror cracking)

319
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:22,957

Guess who's still asleep?

325
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:53,921
- Elias Samson Guerrero?

326
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:55,823
- Yep.

327
00:20:56,057 --> 00:20:57,725

Rach.

(sighs)
- Look, I'm sorry. I saw...

335
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:29,657
- You don't have to apologize.
You had an honest reaction,

336
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,093
that's just life.
It's what happens.

337
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:33,795
- Hey, no, look...

338
00:21:33,828 --> 00:21:35,428
Wait a minute.

339
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,898
- We need a new baby monitor.

340
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:38,566
I'm gonna be back soon.

341
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,505

Hey, buddy. (Papo squawks)

Hi.

Hey.

How you doin', bud? Yeah.

I know. Yeah, hello.

349

You're not mad at me, are you?

350
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:06,961
Look at yourself.

(Papo squawks)

356
00:22:20,107 --> 00:22:21,776
Huh.

Hello?

(Rachel cries out)

367
00:23:05,553 --> 00:23:07,154

369
00:23:22,536 --> 00:23:24,005

(thunder claps)

372
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:33,781
- Stupid bird, I swear to you...

373
00:23:37,184 --> 00:23:38,853
(Papo squawking)

374
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:46,459
I'm gonna make a
pillow outta you.

375
00:23:46,894 --> 00:23:48,529
(Papo squawking)

376
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:51,098
(baby cries in distance)

377
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,535

383
00:24:34,008 --> 00:24:35,643
(Rachel shudders)

384
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,714
(baby crying)

385
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:05,806

386
00:25:06,774 --> 00:25:08,242
(Rachel whimpers)

387
00:25:09,677 --> 00:25:11,178
(Rachel gasping)

388
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:18,853
(door creaks open)

389
00:25:27,762 --> 00:25:30,097
(scary boom) (Rachel gasps)

390
00:25:33,334 --> 00:25:35,002
- Hey. Hey.

391
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:38,873
Hey, what-what's wrong? What
happened? What happened?

392
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:40,641
- There's, I think
there's someone,

393
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:42,152
there's someone in
the apartment. I...

394
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:44,011
- What do you...
What do you mean?

395
00:25:44,045 --> 00:25:45,980
- So, so, okay, so
there was a blackout,

396
00:25:46,013 --> 00:25:47,815
and then I...

397
00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:51,619
There, I think there's
something or someone, I...

398
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:53,120
- Did you call the police?

399
00:25:53,154 --> 00:25:55,156
- No, I didn't. I... I didn't.

400
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,725
(thunder claps)

401
00:26:00,294 --> 00:26:01,962

(Papo talks indistinctly)

404
00:26:24,718 --> 00:26:26,187
- Hello?
- [Papo] Hello.

405
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:30,291
(Papo squawking)

406

(thunder crackles)

407
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:56,684
- If someone's in
here, come out.

408
00:26:58,352 --> 00:27:00,020
(metal rattles)

409
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:01,655
Hey!

410
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:03,157
(Papo squawks)

411
00:27:09,697 --> 00:27:11,265
(thunder crashes)

412
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,400
<i>- [Rachel] Baby,
is everything okay?</i>

413
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:18,272
- Yeah.

414
00:27:18,607 --> 00:27:20,274
Stay in the hall.

415
00:27:20,808 --> 00:27:22,676
(Papo squawking)
(thunder rumbles)

416
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,244

(Papo squawks) (John grunts)

418
00:28:04,218 --> 00:28:05,753
(Papo thuds)

419
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:07,254
(John gasps)

420
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:09,890
Oh, god.

421
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:12,693
Oh, shit, no.

422
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,398
No, Papo. No, no, no.

423
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:21,302
Papo. No.

424
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,370
<i>My mom got him for me.</i>

425
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:26,273
Had him since I was 11.

426
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:35,849
- I'm so sorry,
baby. I'm so sorry.

427
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,018
I'm so sorry.

428
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:39,486
- Don't be.

429
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:42,990
It's not your fault.

430
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:45,459
I did it.

431
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:47,161
(eerie music)

432
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:50,965
(John sighs)

433
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:03,210
- I, I'm...

434
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:07,114
I'm not okay.

435
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:12,186
I'm trying really,
really hard to be okay,

436
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:15,523
but I think I'm not
okay, I think I'm...

437
00:29:17,592 --> 00:29:20,127
I think I'm actually
losing my mind.

438
00:29:21,395 --> 00:29:23,297
I mean, Vivian lost her mind,

439
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,865
she tucked her dead baby

440
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:26,267
into his crib for,
like, two weeks.

441
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,902
- Rach, you're not Vivian, okay?

442
00:29:31,005 --> 00:29:32,473
You know, we're just...

443
00:29:33,274 --> 00:29:34,908
stressed.

444
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:37,845
Parents of a newborn baby.

445
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:41,782
- I'm seeing things.

446
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:49,591
I'm seeing this woman,

447
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:51,292
this old,

448
00:29:51,693 --> 00:29:54,428
hag witch woman

449
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,930
in the darkness, in the mirror,

450
00:29:56,964 --> 00:30:00,067
in the freaking baby
store. I'm going...

451
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,536
(chair clatters)

452
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:08,375
Well, I suppose, wife's
going bat-shit crazy,

453
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:10,077
that's how I'd react too.

454
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:13,314
- No, Rach,

455
00:30:13,347 --> 00:30:15,316
you are not going crazy.

456
00:30:17,151 --> 00:30:19,186
Did you see... Is
that what you saw?

457
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:20,622
Did you see something like that?

458
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:23,057
- That's her. That's her.
- Yeah, okay.

459
00:30:23,658 --> 00:30:25,426
The other morning,
in the shower,

460
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:28,128
same creepy image
got in my head.

461
00:30:30,497 --> 00:30:32,132
- Right.

462
00:30:35,135 --> 00:30:37,137
So, we're just, what, like...

463
00:30:40,374 --> 00:30:42,009
sleep-deprived,

464
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:44,978
freaking cabin fever...

465
00:30:45,346 --> 00:30:46,980
- Yeah, probably.

466
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:49,517
Most likely. Yeah.

467
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:53,987
- But that's not
what you believe.

468
00:30:55,956 --> 00:30:57,424
No, you, no.

469
00:30:57,458 --> 00:30:59,893
We're seeing... Come
on, we're seeing...

470
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:03,030
- Look, Rach, I believe
in us. Okay, that's all.

471
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:05,065
Whatever this is,
whatever's happening,

472
00:31:05,466 --> 00:31:07,101
we're gonna get through this.

473
00:31:07,134 --> 00:31:08,570
Together, okay?

474
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:10,904
We a team.

475
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,109
- Yeah.

476
00:31:15,142 --> 00:31:16,578
Yeah, we a team.

477
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:19,480
- Yeah, and this is
going where it belongs.

478
00:31:19,514 --> 00:31:21,148
- Yeah.

479
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,619
And Eli's sleeping
with us tonight.

480
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:29,022
(baby crying)

481
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:38,165
- Baby's crying.

482
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:42,537
(John sighs)

483
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,204
I'll get it.

484
00:31:44,606 --> 00:31:46,508
I'll get it. You sleep.

485
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,175
(tense suspenseful music)

486
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:49,644
(baby crying)

487
00:32:08,195 --> 00:32:09,664
Okay. Okay, buddy.

488
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:12,966
(door closes)

489
00:32:17,237 --> 00:32:18,673
(baby crying)

490
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:24,044
I'm comin', Eli.

491
00:32:25,312 --> 00:32:26,947
I'm comin'.

492
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,417
(baby crying)

493
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:36,190
(door slams shut)

494
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:38,560
(baby crying)

495
00:32:39,794 --> 00:32:41,462
Eli?

496
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:43,130
(baby crying)

497
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:50,103
Eli? Eli!

498
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:51,639
(baby crying)

499
00:32:54,809 --> 00:32:56,477
What the...?

500
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:58,145
(baby stops crying)

501
00:33:01,749 --> 00:33:03,383
- Hey, hey! (scary bang)

502
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,085
You steal from me, man.

503
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:08,322
That's bad karma, man.

504
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:10,758
(door clicks open)
That's bad juju!

505
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:12,459
(door clicks shut)

506
00:33:12,961 --> 00:33:14,662
(slow mysterious music)

507
00:33:50,464 --> 00:33:52,065
(Eli crying)

508
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:54,268
- Hey, do you have
an alarm snooze...

509
00:33:54,301 --> 00:33:56,671
Snooze button here?

510
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:58,338
(Eli crying)

511
00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:02,510
(Rachel sings softly)

512
00:34:05,747 --> 00:34:07,414
(ghostly voice echoes)

513
00:34:15,289 --> 00:34:16,758
(Rachel sings softly)

514
00:34:20,193 --> 00:34:22,362
(ghostly voice echoes)

515
00:34:23,463 --> 00:34:25,098
(eerie music)

516
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:35,309
Eli?

517
00:34:36,176 --> 00:34:37,645
(baby crying)

518
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,479
Eli?

519
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,716
Eli?

520
00:34:41,749 --> 00:34:43,383
Eli?

521
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:44,852
(baby crying)

522
00:34:46,386 --> 00:34:48,355
Eli, Eli.

523
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,793
Eli. (scary whooshing)

524
00:34:51,826 --> 00:34:53,528
(baby cries)

525
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:56,764
Eli.

526
00:34:57,832 --> 00:34:59,499
(baby crying)

527
00:34:59,534 --> 00:35:01,168
Eli.

528
00:35:03,805 --> 00:35:05,607
(scary music) (Rachel screams)

529
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:08,676
(panting)

530
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:17,552
(Rachel gasps loudly)

531
00:35:17,585 --> 00:35:20,320
My baby, my baby, my baby.

532
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:23,791
(Rachel laughs with relief)

533
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:29,731
Yeah.

534
00:35:30,665 --> 00:35:32,265
- Yeah.

535
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:33,768
- You gonna be okay?

536
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:35,435
- Absolutely.

537
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:37,170
We're long overdue

538
00:35:37,204 --> 00:35:39,741
for some father-son
bonding time anyway, right?

539
00:35:42,543 --> 00:35:44,144
In the meantime,

540
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,180
Eli, he says he wants
you to relax, okay?

541
00:35:49,817 --> 00:35:51,485
- Okay. Thanks Eli.

542
00:35:52,086 --> 00:35:54,221
- All right, bud, here we go.

543
00:35:54,254 --> 00:35:55,723
Opa. (sighs)

544
00:35:57,491 --> 00:35:59,159
- Let me get that.

545
00:36:00,995 --> 00:36:02,664
Okay. I love you.

546
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,599
- I love you more.

547
00:36:05,399 --> 00:36:06,834
Bye.

548
00:36:20,014 --> 00:36:22,449
(slow haunting music)

549
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:42,737
- Hi.
- Hello.

550
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,872
- Vivian Brown,
please. I'm her sister.

551
00:36:48,308 --> 00:36:49,777
(birds chirping)

552
00:36:52,814 --> 00:36:54,448
(door clicks open)

553
00:37:14,068 --> 00:37:16,303
- Hey, John.

554
00:37:17,605 --> 00:37:20,908
And the little monster. Hi.

555
00:37:21,274 --> 00:37:23,477
Hey. Hi. (laughs)

556
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:28,883
What's happened?

557
00:37:29,282 --> 00:37:30,952
(exhales sharply)

558
00:37:31,853 --> 00:37:33,487
Do Jews have exorcists?

559
00:37:39,727 --> 00:37:41,763
- Come. Sit.

560
00:37:42,163 --> 00:37:43,831
(slow somber music)

561
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:46,333
(John sighs)

562
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:50,538
(birds chirping)

563
00:37:54,842 --> 00:37:56,476
- Hey, Viv.

564
00:37:56,811 --> 00:37:58,445
(slow somber music)

565
00:38:03,985 --> 00:38:05,653
- Hi, Rachel.

566
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:08,455
- Can I sit?
- Of course.

567
00:38:10,091 --> 00:38:11,759
<i>- Rachel's sister,</i>

568
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:13,426
Vivian,

569
00:38:15,763 --> 00:38:17,732
came to me with the same story,

570
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:20,101
the same questions.

571
00:38:20,134 --> 00:38:21,969
- Vivian did?

572
00:38:23,104 --> 00:38:25,338
What did you tell her?

573
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:29,342
(scoffs)

574
00:38:30,711 --> 00:38:32,379
You thought she was crazy.

575
00:38:34,715 --> 00:38:37,350
- Mom sent your
stuff, from storage.

576
00:38:38,586 --> 00:38:41,522
- No. No, no. No, no.
I locked that stuff up.

577
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:42,924
Mom...

578
00:38:42,957 --> 00:38:44,692
Mama should not have done that.

579
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:46,894
- I found the lullaby book.

580
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:50,998
- Did you sing from it?

581
00:38:54,001 --> 00:38:56,137
Rachel, listen to me.

582
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,839
Zachary was taken.

583
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:01,008
I sang that song, and she came

584
00:39:01,742 --> 00:39:03,410
and she took him.

585
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,447
- Who came?

586
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:11,152
Who is she?

587
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:12,854
- Lilith.

588
00:39:13,654 --> 00:39:15,056
<i>- Lilith</i>

589
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:16,791
was the first woman

590
00:39:18,626 --> 00:39:20,928
made by God to be Adam's wife.

591
00:39:21,529 --> 00:39:23,164
<i>- They would lie together</i>

592
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:24,765
in Eden,

593
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:26,767
and he would sing her a song.

594
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:28,669
It was their special song.

595
00:39:28,703 --> 00:39:30,504
And whenever Lilith
heard that song

596
00:39:30,538 --> 00:39:32,006
she'd come running.

597
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,641
She loved Adam,

598
00:39:33,674 --> 00:39:36,878
but she was a strong woman
and she refused to submit.

599
00:39:38,478 --> 00:39:39,914
<i>- The legend says</i>

600
00:39:39,947 --> 00:39:42,783
she was banished from the
Garden of Eden by God.

601
00:39:42,817 --> 00:39:44,484
She roamed the wilderness.

602
00:39:45,052 --> 00:39:46,721
She lay with wolves.

603
00:39:51,092 --> 00:39:54,695
And gave birth to her own
race of imperfect creations.

604
00:39:56,664 --> 00:39:58,065
<i>- Deformed,</i>

605
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:00,167
hungry, half human, half...

606
00:40:00,568 --> 00:40:02,402
Half something else.

607
00:40:06,841 --> 00:40:10,578
Lilith saw Adam and Eve
and their perfect babies,

608
00:40:10,611 --> 00:40:12,980
and then she looked at
her own broken children.

609
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:15,415
And that's when she started
stealing their children.

610
00:40:16,017 --> 00:40:17,652
Our children.

611
00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:22,156
- And so it went
for generations,

612
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:24,091
until God listened

613
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,893
to the prayers of
Adam's progeny,

614
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:28,896
and he sent her

615
00:40:29,664 --> 00:40:31,032
to the underworld.

616
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:34,568
- You know the word lullaby
comes from Lilith-abi.

617
00:40:35,736 --> 00:40:37,672
It means "Lilith begone."

618
00:40:39,206 --> 00:40:42,510
Mothers sing lullabies
to keep Lilith away.

619
00:40:43,544 --> 00:40:45,012
But Lilith, (chuckles)

620
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:47,748
Lilith took her and Adam's song,

621
00:40:48,749 --> 00:40:50,184
their special song,

622
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:52,186
and she twisted it.

623
00:40:52,586 --> 00:40:55,623
She turned it into a lullaby
that does the opposite.

624
00:40:56,958 --> 00:40:58,592
It summons her.

625
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,131
I sang that song,

626
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:06,901
and she came.

627
00:41:10,638 --> 00:41:13,140
She took my Zachary,

628
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:16,544
and that corpse they found

629
00:41:16,577 --> 00:41:19,680
that had been dead for who
knows how long, that...

630
00:41:21,282 --> 00:41:23,584
That was not my son.

631
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:28,222
I can help you, Rachel.

632
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:29,924
I can help Eli.

633
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:32,159
I need to help Eli.

634
00:41:34,862 --> 00:41:36,496
- How?

635
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:40,167
- You have to get me
the fuck outta here.

636
00:41:41,936 --> 00:41:44,839
- Rabbi, this woman, Lilith...

637
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:46,807
- She's a myth.

638
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:49,076
What I'm telling
you are legends,

639
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:51,078
fables used for
lessons and guidance.

640
00:41:51,112 --> 00:41:53,280
- Yeah, I know,
that's why I'm here.

641
00:41:53,547 --> 00:41:56,150
Lilith, she's in your
stories, your fables.

642
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:57,818
(scoffs)

643
00:41:57,852 --> 00:42:00,721
I'm telling you,
something's happening.

644
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:02,757
- And I wanna help.
- Then help.

645
00:42:03,257 --> 00:42:04,892
There has to be something.

646
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:08,162
A-a-a prayer you can give
me. I don't know, something.

647
00:42:08,195 --> 00:42:09,630
- That isn't how
our religion works.

648
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:10,898
- Is this what you told Vivian

649
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:12,242
when she came to you
looking for answers?

650
00:42:12,266 --> 00:42:14,235
- There was nothing I could do.

651
00:42:20,307 --> 00:42:21,976
(Rabbi Simowitz sighs)

652
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:23,644
(John sighs)

653
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,285
(eerie music)

654
00:42:36,323 --> 00:42:37,992
(music fades out)

655
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:39,660
- Rach, we're home.

656
00:42:40,895 --> 00:42:42,296
Hey, bud.

657
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:45,699
What do you say we
get out of that, huh?

658
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,702
And now we go opa.

659
00:42:49,136 --> 00:42:51,739
Oh, yeah, we're not gonna
forget this thing, right?

660
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:53,240
Yeah. (chuckles)

661
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:56,343
Yeah, huh? Rach?

662
00:42:56,877 --> 00:42:58,712
(water splattering)

663
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,250
Shit.

664
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:06,921
Okay, buddy, I need
you to hang here, okay?

665
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:09,723
Opa. There we go.
You have the toy.

666
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:11,892
Okay? Just for second.

667
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:14,695
Shit.

668
00:43:18,065 --> 00:43:19,700
Shit.

669
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:22,002
(faucet squeaks)

670
00:43:24,805 --> 00:43:26,273
(door bangs shut)

671
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:28,909
(deep foreboding music)

672
00:43:35,149 --> 00:43:36,784
(Eli babbling)

673
00:43:41,755 --> 00:43:43,224
(Quad Lilim gurgling)

674
00:43:46,093 --> 00:43:47,728
(Eli giggles)

675
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:54,702
(Eli babbles)

676
00:43:57,338 --> 00:43:59,006
(Quad Lilim grunts)

677
00:44:01,742 --> 00:44:03,410
(Eli giggles)

678
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:05,913
(glass shatters)

679
00:44:05,946 --> 00:44:07,348
Shit.

680
00:44:07,381 --> 00:44:09,049
(water splattering)

681
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:13,754
(soft haunting music)

682
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,228
(glass clinks)

683
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,334
(dramatic boom)

684
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,007
(tense music)

685
00:44:37,378 --> 00:44:39,046
(Eli screams)

686
00:44:41,516 --> 00:44:43,450
- What, you just...
you left him?

687
00:44:43,484 --> 00:44:44,985
- What?

688
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:46,887
No, I just-I just put
him down for a second.

689
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:48,389
The-the bathroom...

690
00:44:49,056 --> 00:44:50,691
Is he okay?

691
00:44:53,994 --> 00:44:55,429
Vivian.

692
00:44:56,397 --> 00:44:58,065
- They're here.

693
00:44:58,098 --> 00:44:59,733
(eerie music)

694
00:45:03,505 --> 00:45:05,172
Lilith's servants.

695
00:45:06,941 --> 00:45:08,842
We cover mirrors after funerals

696
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:10,978
so our departed loved
ones don't stare at us

697
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:12,446
from the afterlife.

698
00:45:12,746 --> 00:45:14,381
So it is with Lilith.

699
00:45:14,649 --> 00:45:16,917
I thought that breaking
the mirrors would work,

700
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:18,385
but this is better.

701
00:45:18,419 --> 00:45:20,087
This is right.

702
00:45:21,422 --> 00:45:23,090
- Right.

703
00:45:33,834 --> 00:45:36,403
- Isn't she supposed to
be in the psych ward?

704
00:45:36,437 --> 00:45:38,072
- Maybe.

705
00:45:38,105 --> 00:45:39,773
- [John] So you thought
it was a good idea

706
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:41,242
to bring your crazy sister here?

707
00:45:41,275 --> 00:45:43,010
- [Rachel] Don't talk
about her like that.

708
00:45:43,043 --> 00:45:46,013
- [John] Maybe this wasn't a
fire that needs gasoline, Rach.

709
00:45:46,046 --> 00:45:47,457
- [Rachel] I just
thought after everything

710
00:45:47,481 --> 00:45:49,917
we've been through and
experienced and, you know,

711
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,385
the book was hers.

712
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:53,254
She-she-she lost it.

713
00:45:53,287 --> 00:45:55,055
- Exactly. She lost.

714
00:45:55,089 --> 00:45:57,224
She lost her baby.
She lost her husband.

715
00:45:57,258 --> 00:45:58,459
She lost her mind.

716
00:45:58,492 --> 00:46:00,261
- I didn't lose my baby.

717
00:46:00,595 --> 00:46:03,097
That thing we buried
was not my child.

718
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,033
Lilith took my little boy

719
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:08,435
and her Crone killed my husband.

720
00:46:09,236 --> 00:46:11,405
- I thought a
mirror fell on him.

721
00:46:11,438 --> 00:46:14,141
- You don't have the
luxury of skepticism, John.

722
00:46:14,174 --> 00:46:15,909
Not anymore.

723
00:46:15,943 --> 00:46:17,411
You sang her song,

724
00:46:17,612 --> 00:46:19,780
and now she is coming for Eli.

725
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:21,583
- What's the plan here?

726
00:46:21,616 --> 00:46:24,818
I mean, but how... How
do we protect our son?

727
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,920
- Don't take your eyes off him.

728
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:28,523
And if you see her Crone,

729
00:46:29,123 --> 00:46:30,558
run.

730
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:32,826
(telephone rings)

731
00:46:34,995 --> 00:46:36,463
Come with me.

732
00:46:38,332 --> 00:46:39,967
Let's finish.

733
00:46:42,269 --> 00:46:43,871
- Hello?

734
00:46:43,904 --> 00:46:46,541
- [Man On Phone] I
understand you have a book.

735
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,277
- Who is this?

736
00:46:50,811 --> 00:46:54,081
- [Man On Phone] Your rabbi
said you need help, John.

737
00:46:55,949 --> 00:46:57,418
Get a pen.

738
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,488
- You're leaving?

739
00:47:01,656 --> 00:47:03,824
- There's something
I have to do.

740
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:06,894
- Don't worry.
We'll keep Eli safe.

741
00:47:09,029 --> 00:47:10,864
(Elevator arrival chime)

742
00:47:14,968 --> 00:47:16,437
(engages lock)

743
00:47:31,285 --> 00:47:33,287
I see congratulations
are in order.

744
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,092
- With everything going on, I...

745
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:40,094
I don't think I've
even told Johnny.

746
00:47:41,261 --> 00:47:42,896
That came so easy.

747
00:47:43,665 --> 00:47:45,332
(Eli fusses)

748
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:47,968
- What is it?

749
00:47:48,001 --> 00:47:51,004
- No, this thought just
comes into my head sometimes.

750
00:47:54,074 --> 00:47:56,343
I don't even wanna
say it out loud.

751
00:47:56,377 --> 00:47:58,212
It's a horrible,
horrible thought.

752
00:48:07,287 --> 00:48:09,923
What if this is the
universe's way of telling me

753
00:48:09,957 --> 00:48:11,925
I'm not fit to be a mom?

754
00:48:13,427 --> 00:48:15,329
No, Rachel, no.

755
00:48:15,362 --> 00:48:17,030
Don't you dare question that.

756
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:20,602
This, this is exactly
what she does.

757
00:48:20,635 --> 00:48:22,269
She gets inside your head,

758
00:48:22,670 --> 00:48:25,540
makes you ask if you
deserve to be Eli's mother,

759
00:48:25,573 --> 00:48:27,241
makes you lose faith.

760
00:48:27,709 --> 00:48:30,110
You can't let her
take that bond away.

761
00:48:31,278 --> 00:48:34,114
You are his mother and
you always will be.

762
00:48:47,662 --> 00:48:49,329
I always loved this lamp.

763
00:48:50,197 --> 00:48:51,666
I'm glad you kept it.

764
00:48:55,269 --> 00:48:57,672
- Hey, where did the
lullaby book come from?

765
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:00,441
- Nowhere exciting.

766
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:04,344
Little antique shop in
West Nowheresville, Maine.

767
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:07,147
- Why didn't you throw it away?

768
00:49:08,081 --> 00:49:09,551
- Because it's real.

769
00:49:10,752 --> 00:49:13,487
Because it proves what happened.

770
00:49:16,457 --> 00:49:18,091
(deep somber music)

771
00:49:32,607 --> 00:49:34,241
(horn honks)

772
00:49:35,042 --> 00:49:36,511
(deep somber music)

773
00:49:58,733 --> 00:50:00,400
- It's Shabbes.

774
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:03,705
- Oh, right, yeah.

775
00:50:03,738 --> 00:50:05,507
I'm sorry.

776
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,775
Uh, I'm looking...

777
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:10,010
Looking for this address.

778
00:50:11,144 --> 00:50:12,614
- The Dybbuk Man.

779
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:14,281
(other man spits three times)

780
00:50:14,816 --> 00:50:16,483
(deep somber music)

781
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:31,265
(siren blares in distance)

782
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:34,802
(crickets chirping)

783
00:50:48,616 --> 00:50:50,384
(pounding on door)

784
00:50:57,792 --> 00:50:59,459
(pounding on door)

785
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:03,731
(John sighs)

786
00:51:04,732 --> 00:51:06,400
- Unbelievable.

787
00:51:07,334 --> 00:51:08,770
(sighs)

788
00:51:09,771 --> 00:51:11,438
(door clangs)

789
00:51:14,742 --> 00:51:16,410
- Rabbi Cohen's waiting.

790
00:51:17,277 --> 00:51:18,746
(door closes)

791
00:51:19,781 --> 00:51:21,448

convert.

805
00:52:25,513 --> 00:52:27,147

(Rabbi Cohen sighs)

812
00:52:52,339 --> 00:52:53,941
- You called me on the Sabbath.

813
00:52:53,975 --> 00:52:55,877
- You brought the book?

814
00:53:00,648 --> 00:53:02,282
(book thuds onto table)

815
00:53:03,818 --> 00:53:05,419
Now...

816
00:53:05,452 --> 00:53:07,220
- Kinda beautiful
in a creepy way.

817
00:53:07,254 --> 00:53:08,690
- We live in kinda creepy,

818
00:53:08,723 --> 00:53:10,725
kinda beautiful times, don't we?

819
00:53:12,794 --> 00:53:14,428
(Rabbi Cohen mumbles)

820
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:18,800
- My wife's parents didn't
speak to her for months

821
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,568
when she got her tattoo.

822
00:53:22,036 --> 00:53:25,305
- This is not classical Hebrew,
but neither is it modern,

823
00:53:25,338 --> 00:53:27,274
probably from a middle period.

824
00:53:27,842 --> 00:53:29,443
- Oh.

825
00:53:29,476 --> 00:53:30,912
Well, see, it's-it's pressed.

826
00:53:31,244 --> 00:53:33,881
Can't be older than late
15th century, I'd say.

827
00:53:34,481 --> 00:53:35,883
- Mm-hm.

828
00:53:36,084 --> 00:53:37,752
Good.

829
00:53:38,953 --> 00:53:40,855
These tattoos are
not the only reason

830
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:43,524
I'm going to be unwelcome
in a Jewish cemetery.

831
00:53:44,525 --> 00:53:46,259
And as for the phone call,

832
00:53:46,627 --> 00:53:48,361
with what you're facing,

833
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:49,864
God will understand.

834
00:53:49,897 --> 00:53:51,532
(crickets chirping)
(ominous music)

835
00:53:58,338 --> 00:53:59,807
(creaking)

836
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:02,510
(ghostly grumblings)

837
00:54:05,345 --> 00:54:07,782
You sang this song to
make your child sleep?

838
00:54:07,815 --> 00:54:09,349
- My wife did, yeah.

839
00:54:09,382 --> 00:54:10,651
- It's a clever trap,

840
00:54:10,685 --> 00:54:12,720
tricking you into
taking that first step,

841
00:54:12,754 --> 00:54:14,922
giving the key that first twist.

842
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:17,625
- First step?

843
00:54:17,658 --> 00:54:19,694
- The first of
three... rituals.

844
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:23,865
Lilith is close,
she's watching you,

845
00:54:24,397 --> 00:54:26,801
but the door's not
open for her yet.

846
00:54:26,834 --> 00:54:28,836
The song is the first ritual,

847
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:31,371
which calls her
handmaid, the Crone,

848
00:54:31,404 --> 00:54:33,741
and her servants, the Lilim.

849
00:54:35,777 --> 00:54:37,377
- Lilim?

850
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:39,080
- Fucked up, mutant babies.

851
00:54:39,113 --> 00:54:40,782
- Mutant?

852
00:54:41,115 --> 00:54:42,950
(scoffs) Okay.

853
00:54:42,984 --> 00:54:44,652
(eerie music)

854
00:54:44,685 --> 00:54:46,319
(door creaks)

855
00:54:50,825 --> 00:54:52,560
(Quad Lilim hissing)

856
00:54:54,494 --> 00:54:56,329
(guttural sounds)

857
00:55:03,971 --> 00:55:06,741
- The second ritual
is a blood sacrifice

858
00:55:06,774 --> 00:55:09,076
of an unclean beast
to profane your home.

859
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,611
- Wait, right, uh,

860
00:55:10,645 --> 00:55:12,647
what-what kind of rabbi
did you say you were?

861
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,381
- The kind that saves your son.

862
00:55:14,414 --> 00:55:16,584
Have you had any animals
that have died lately?

863
00:55:16,617 --> 00:55:18,619
Pets, that sort of thing?

864
00:55:19,587 --> 00:55:21,022
- Yeah, I had a...

865
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:23,057
a cockatoo that died.

866
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:24,959
It was an accident.

867
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:26,627
- A parrot.

868
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,963
That's unclean.

869
00:55:28,996 --> 00:55:30,665
- What's the third step?

870
00:55:30,698 --> 00:55:32,967
- The third step is you have
to spill the baby's blood.

871
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,569
- Well, that's not gonna happen.

872
00:55:34,602 --> 00:55:36,103
- Neither would
sacrificing your pet.

873
00:55:36,137 --> 00:55:37,839
Don't you see?

874
00:55:37,872 --> 00:55:39,640
The harbingers are subtle.

875
00:55:39,674 --> 00:55:41,008
They manipulate.

876
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:44,045
They live to open
the door for Lilith.

877
00:55:44,078 --> 00:55:46,614
If Eli spills one drop of blood,

878
00:55:46,914 --> 00:55:49,083
Lilith will come and
she will take him,

879
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:51,686
and she will leave an imposter,

880
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:54,088
a golem, in his place.

881
00:55:54,121 --> 00:55:55,790
(deep tense music)

882
00:55:57,592 --> 00:55:59,060

885

(slow mysterious music)

886
00:56:24,118 --> 00:56:25,786
(Eli cries)

887
00:56:27,021 --> 00:56:29,757
- Hey, what's up? What's up?

888
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,458
What's up? What happened?

889
00:56:32,093 --> 00:56:34,829
What happened? What
happened, baby?

890
00:56:35,263 --> 00:56:37,430
What, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

891
00:56:38,032 --> 00:56:39,634
Okay, okay, okay.

00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:43,504

don't say a word ♪

895
00:56:46,674 --> 00:56:48,209
Oh, my god, baby. (Eli crying)

896
00:56:48,242 --> 00:56:50,177
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

897
00:56:50,211 --> 00:56:51,879
(scary bang)

898
00:56:51,913 --> 00:56:53,446
- Hey, are you okay?

899
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,949
(Eli crying)

900
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,818
- I hit his head.

901
00:56:57,852 --> 00:56:59,553
I hit his head I think.

902
00:56:59,587 --> 00:57:00,855
(Eli crying)

903
00:57:00,888 --> 00:57:02,489
- Sh.
- Oh, he's okay.

904
00:57:02,523 --> 00:57:03,991
- Shush, shush.

905
00:57:04,025 --> 00:57:06,127
Oh, Vivian, I don't
know what to do.

906
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,195
- Here, here, let me take him.

907
00:57:08,229 --> 00:57:09,897
Okay, okay.

908
00:57:11,565 --> 00:57:13,734
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

909
00:57:13,768 --> 00:57:15,202
(Eli fusses)

910
00:57:15,468 --> 00:57:17,705
Oh, yes, oh.

911
00:57:17,738 --> 00:57:20,007
Sh, sh, sh.

912
00:57:20,308 --> 00:57:21,976
Yeah, he's good.

913
00:57:22,343 --> 00:57:23,978
Hi, there.

914
00:57:24,011 --> 00:57:25,222
- I'm actually... I'm
gonna take a moment.

915
00:57:25,246 --> 00:57:26,514
I'll be right back.

916
00:57:26,547 --> 00:57:28,015
- Take your time.

917
00:57:28,783 --> 00:57:30,851
Oh. Bye, Mama.

918
00:57:31,919 --> 00:57:34,121
- You need to
recite these words.

919
00:57:34,155 --> 00:57:35,823
Stevie, please.

920
00:57:38,793 --> 00:57:40,995
Those candles must
burn until dawn.

921
00:57:41,295 --> 00:57:43,230
Lilith cannot come
into holy light.

922
00:57:43,864 --> 00:57:45,666
You must do these things

923
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,467
until the first
light on Shabbes.

924
00:57:48,536 --> 00:57:50,004
Then, and only then,

925
00:57:50,037 --> 00:57:52,173
will Lilith be driven
from your home.

926
00:57:54,208 --> 00:57:56,644
- So, it's like
splashing some holy water

927
00:57:56,677 --> 00:57:57,979
and saying the Our Father?

928
00:57:58,012 --> 00:57:59,747
- Wake up, man.

929
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,516
This is about saving your son.

930
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:05,653
Tell me, John, why
did you convert?

931
00:58:06,654 --> 00:58:08,089
- Love.

932
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,692
And my mother-in-law. (scoffs)

933
00:58:11,726 --> 00:58:14,862
- Unfortunately, Lilith
isn't that easily fooled.

934
00:58:15,563 --> 00:58:17,965
She can tell the
difference between apathy

935
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,868
and a true believer.

936
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:27,174
Take this.

937
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,914
It professes your faith, John.

938
00:58:33,948 --> 00:58:35,549
Lilith is strong,

939
00:58:35,816 --> 00:58:37,985
but she's not as
strong as faith.

940
00:58:38,552 --> 00:58:41,288
And that's something you're
going to need to muster.

941
00:58:41,322 --> 00:58:42,990
(paper rustling)

942
00:58:43,024 --> 00:58:44,658
(John sighs)

943
00:58:47,261 --> 00:58:48,929
(hand thuds) (eerie boom)

944
00:58:49,897 --> 00:58:51,298
This stays here.

945
00:58:51,332 --> 00:58:52,967
It is a thing of darkness

946
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,769
and does not belong
in this world.

947
00:58:54,802 --> 00:58:56,270
(deep somber music)

948
00:59:05,346 --> 00:59:07,014
Go with God.

949
00:59:07,348 --> 00:59:09,016
(chair scrapes floor)

950
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,684
(slow somber music)

951
00:59:13,354 --> 00:59:15,022
(glasses clatter to desk)

952
00:59:27,902 --> 00:59:29,570
- Is everything okay?

953
00:59:30,371 --> 00:59:32,773
- [Vivian] Yep. He's
getting ready to snooze.

954
00:59:36,977 --> 00:59:38,612
(Rachel sighs)

955
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,048
(slow foreboding music)

956
00:59:44,919 --> 00:59:46,353
- Nebech.

957
00:59:48,355 --> 00:59:50,024
Poor motherfucker.

958
00:59:50,491 --> 00:59:52,159
(slow foreboding music)

959
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:01,135
(cellphone buzzes)

960
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,741
(water splatters)

961
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:09,276
(Rachel sighs)

962
01:00:10,044 --> 01:00:11,679
(car engine revs)

963
01:00:14,715 --> 01:00:16,183
(slow haunting music)

964
01:00:26,127 --> 01:00:27,761
(Eli babbling)

965
01:00:33,334 --> 01:00:35,002
- Hi, honey.

966
01:00:36,937 --> 01:00:38,739
Yeah, I got you.

967
01:00:42,176 --> 01:00:43,811
(soft tense music)

968
01:00:53,821 --> 01:00:55,322

(Eli babbles)

01:02:09,463 --> 01:02:11,232
- I know everything about her.

988
01:02:13,568 --> 01:02:15,236
- What are you doing?

989
01:02:16,837 --> 01:02:18,906
- There wasn't any
other choice, Rachel.

990
01:02:20,474 --> 01:02:22,142
This is the only way.

991
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,045
- I don't understand.

992
01:02:25,446 --> 01:02:27,414
- When Lilith
comes for your son,

993
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:31,385
I'll get my Zachary back.

994
01:02:31,686 --> 01:02:33,420
- You wanted this to happen?

995
01:02:33,454 --> 01:02:35,256
- Not want.

996
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:36,890
I needed it to.

997
01:02:37,291 --> 01:02:40,928
- You, you told Mom to
send me the lullaby book.

998
01:02:40,961 --> 01:02:42,496
You wanted me to sing it.

999
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:44,198
- Yes.

1000
01:02:45,499 --> 01:02:47,167
No.

1001
01:02:48,202 --> 01:02:49,970
A bit of both, Rach.

1002
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:52,406
Every night since Eli was born,

1003
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:54,375
I sat there praying
that you'd sing

1004
01:02:54,408 --> 01:02:56,176
and praying that you wouldn't.

1005
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:57,545
- Give him to me.

1006
01:02:57,579 --> 01:02:59,246
- She'll come.

1007
01:02:59,547 --> 01:03:01,315
We'll follow her into the dark,

1008
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:03,817
and we'll bring them both home,

1009
01:03:04,952 --> 01:03:06,887
Eli and Zachary.

1010
01:03:07,522 --> 01:03:09,256
- If you hurt him...

1011
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:11,258
- It's just a little pin prick.

1012
01:03:12,459 --> 01:03:14,128
(Eli coos)

1013
01:03:15,896 --> 01:03:17,364

1018
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:53,834
- Sing with me, Rachel.

1019
01:03:55,102 --> 01:03:56,870
We have to face this together,

1020
01:03:57,605 --> 01:03:59,273

1028

Get outta here!

1029
01:04:27,669 --> 01:04:29,436
Go back to your psych ward.

1036
01:04:45,986 --> 01:04:49,289
- I'm not crazy, Rachel.
You have to trust me.

1037
01:04:49,323 --> 01:04:50,958
(Rachel yells)
- No!

No, no.

1060
01:06:40,602 --> 01:06:42,202
She took my son.

- Where the fuck
did you bring us?

1097
01:08:50,031 --> 01:08:51,532
- This is Lilith's home.

1098
01:08:57,404 --> 01:09:00,440
Tell me you wouldn't have
done the same thing for Eli.

1099
01:09:00,474 --> 01:09:02,342
We're not gonna
find them like this.

Hey, you're not gonna
find him like this.

1101
01:09:03,845 --> 01:09:05,647
- Get off me!
- You're not gonna find him

1102
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,180
like this, you need
to call his name.

1103
01:09:07,214 --> 01:09:09,282
He needs to hear your voice.

1104
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,719
Call your son.
