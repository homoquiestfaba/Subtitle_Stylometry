1
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,795
- (men banging)
- Kleinman, open up!

2
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,992
- Kleinman!
- We know you're in there!

3
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,076
Kleinman!

4
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,076
Come on, Kleinman!

5
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,234
l'm coming! l'm coming!

6
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,271
Kleinman!

7
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,473
- For God's sake, Kleinman. Are you deaf?
- What do you mean? What's going on?

8
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,556
- We need you. Get dressed.
- Why?

9
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,069
- Don't play ignorant.
- l was in a deep sleep.

10
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,397
- We expect the killer to strike tonight.
- What killer?

11
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,317
- The strangler.
- What strangler?

12
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,877
The maniac who killed Eisler's son
and choked Jensen with the piano wire.

13
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,993
Jensen? The... the...
the big night watchman?

14
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,554
That's right. Took him from behind.

15
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,275
Crept up, got him by the throat.
He was blue when we found him.

16
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,039
Saliva frozen down the corner
of his mouth.

17
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,998
Well, look, l've gotta be up early
tomorrow for work, so...

18
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,511
Don't play dumb. Tonight's a foggy night.
He always strikes in the fog.

19
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,110
Yeah, but, you see, this is a very
busy time for me in my firm.

20
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,073
l'm in competition for
a promotion with Simon Carr.

21
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,317
Don't you know no one
can walk the streets at night?

22
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,671
And the Quilty sisters
were killed in their own home...

23
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,997
..because they didn't lock the door,
throats cut from ear to ear.

24
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,590
- You said he was a strangler.
- Does it matter how he kills?!

25
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,598
What is he getting so angry for? OK, OK.

26
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,234
- There's no motive?
- So you know about it.

27
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,318
Well, you know, l hear,
now and then, a drib and drab.

28
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,954
- He hears what he wants to hear.
- Get dressed.

29
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,799
- This is police business.
- They've had their chance.

30
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,309
- We're taking it into our own hands.
- That's scary.

31
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,273
- You're one of us, aren't you?
- l'm definitely one of you.

32
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,914
- What do you want me to do?
- We have a plan to trap him.

33
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,918
- What kind of plan?
- lt's Hacker's. He should tell it.

34
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,793
You'll find out your assignment.
Get dressed.

35
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,117
- What do you mean?
- Meet you downstairs in five minutes.

36
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,515
My theory is, it's someone
that we all know,...

37
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,074
..someone we work next to
or go to church with.

38
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,589
He lurks in the shadows,
waiting to pounce.

39
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,838
But, you see, l was in a deep sleep,
so... so l was...

40
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,671
What is this plan? How can l be of help?

41
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,360
Kleinman. Kleinman. ln, in, in, in.

42
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,716
Kleinman, here.

43
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,876
- l brought you some pepper.
- Pepper?

44
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,232
l overheard everything. lf you're caught
by the maniac, blow pepper in his eyes.

45
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,875
Very good. l'll ward him off with
a seasoning. This is ridiculous!

46
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,992
- l'm petrified. l'm not gonna go out...
- Be a man, Kleinman.

47
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,352
Be a man? Suddenly, in the middle of the
night, l gotta put on a suit and a tie and...

48
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,439
What do you need a tie for? You're
going to hunt for a homicidal maniac.

49
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,757
Do l know who l'll run into out there?
What if l see my boss?

50
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,836
Mr Paulsen is funny that way.

51
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,475
There's a big competition between me
and Simon Carr for this promotion.

52
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,479
What are you killing yourself for?
What does it mean? An extra few dollars?

53
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,751
No, l told you. lt isn't the money.
l wanna amount to something.

54
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,429
Why should Carr get the promotion?
Because he takes Paulsen to dinner?

55
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,439
You're too frightened of Mr Paulsen.
You cringe in front of him like a worm.

56
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,279
Well, he makes me nervous.
And l don't cringe.

57
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,473
- Calling him ''Your Majesty'' is cringing.
- Stop it. l don't like this.

58
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,990
l don't wanna go out. l was in a nice
warm bed. Suddenly l'm part of a plan.

59
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,590
Come to your senses and marry me.
You could tell your boss to stuff it...

60
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,110
- ..and you'd own half of this whole place.
- l'm not gonna marry you.

61
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,913
- l have a fiancée.
- Some fiancée.

62
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,918
Eve wants you for an ornament,
if you get the promotion.

63
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,759
Don't talk about Eve.
l don't wanna discuss this.

64
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,759
- Eve is a lovely creature.
- Eve treats you like scum. Be careful.

65
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,396
l'd hate for them to find you in an alley
with your throat slit from ear to ear.

66
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,876
Don't worry about that.
He mostly strangles.

67
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,235
Gee, it´s empty.

68
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,669
Where is everybody?

69
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,473
They´re supposed to be here.

70
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,716
Where the hell´d they go?

71
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,195
The street´s so desolate.

72
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,355
(cat screeches)

73
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,350
l don´t like this. l wanna get back into bed.
l can´t do that, though.

74
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,031
lfsomething goes wrong with their plan,
they´ll say it´s my fault.

75
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,230
Why me?

76
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,069
l'm an artist. Every town we played in,
l'd get huge laughs. And here, nothing.

77
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,670
l mean, no one comes, and the few
that do just sit there stonefaced.

78
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,588
l know. l was very little appreciated
myself. None of us were.

79
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,315
- Your specialty is quite different to mine.
- l don't know about that.

80
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,116
You can tell a lot about an audience by
how they respond to a sword-swallower.

81
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,234
Nothing is more terrifying than attempting
to make people laugh, and failing.

82
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,079
Why do we put up with it?
When we pull out tomorrow,...

83
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,998
..why don't we just tell
Danzig we're quitting?

84
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,793
- To do what?
- Well, settle down.

85
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,277
Where we don't have to travel all the time,
where it's not such a gruelling life.

86
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,710
Get married, you know.
Live like other people.

87
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,196
We're not like other people. We're artists.

88
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,880
With great talent comes responsibility.

89
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,834
But it would be so nice.
You could find a job someplace.

90
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,953
Doing what? Collecting other people's
refuse? Sweeping the streets?

91
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,629
Of course not! No, you're clever.
Somebody'd give you an opportunity.

92
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,833
But l have a rare opportunity now,
to make people laugh.

93
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,428
To make them forget their sad lives.

94
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,916
Listen, it's not my fault
that this stupid travelling show...

95
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,759
..is completely mismanaged.

96
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,000
l'm sure Danzig steals...
every cent of profit.

97
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,159
- l wanna have a baby.
- We're going to, but not right now.

98
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,637
A family? That's death to the artist.
l need peace and quiet.

99
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,355
l mean, you know, my mind, it's funny...

100
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,358
lt's just constantly filled with...

101
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,712
..new routines, ideas, gags,
brilliant and creative twists.

102
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,877
Why don't you tell the truth?
You don't want to get married.

103
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,515
So you can play cards and flirt
with all the adoring ladies.

104
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,835
- That's not true.
- Oh, yes, it is.

105
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,520
l have to make a name for myself first.

106
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,995
- (sobs)
- We will get marr...

107
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,672
- l love you.
- No. You keep promising.

108
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,554
But soon it's gonna be too late
for me to have a baby.

109
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,628
Don't cry.

110
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,752
- Listen, l'll talk to Danzig.
- You don't mean it.

111
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,270
l do mean it. Stop.
You know l can't stand that.

112
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,630
Don't cry.

113
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,273
(woman) The audience
was too quiet tonight.

114
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,709
l felt sorry for you.

115
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,832
You're the only one they seem to like.

116
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,872
Yeah, but l have my little tricks
for seducing them.

117
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,956
Yes.

118
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,952
What are you doing
wandering around out here?

119
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,640
l was on my way to speak to Danzig.

120
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,476
Like lrish whiskey?

121
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,196
Yes, but my doctor says
it's very bad for my stomach.

122
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,389
Oh.

123
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,875
That's too bad.

124
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,796
But, uh...

125
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,040
lt's... probably relaxing.

126
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,311
The most voluptuous woman
in the circus.

127
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,558
lt would be my luck
she'd be married to the strongman.

128
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,673
Don't worry about Peter.
He's had a gallon of this already.

129
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,636
(snoring)

130
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,639
(clown) You know, sometimes when
you're up on the high wire, l look at you.

131
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,716
You look so...

132
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,596
What?

133
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,676
Edible.

134
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,640
How hungry are you now?

135
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,231
l'm always famished
after a performance. And you?

136
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,113
l can never sleep on an empty stomach.

137
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,958
Do you have a taste for anything special?

138
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,192
l'm not fussy. l eat
what you put in front of me.

139
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,834
And you're sure
your husband won't wake up?

140
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,838
l mean, l have seen
what he does to iron bars.

141
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,554
Nothing wakes Peter up.

142
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,831
Certainly not the sound
of two people moaning.

143
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,229
Oh, you...! Thank God
l saw you come in here!

144
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,954
- Rat! You rat!
- (clown) lrmy!

145
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,550
You said you were going to Danzig!
You were supposed to go to Danzig!

146
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,830
- Sh! My husband.
- Damn you!

147
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,150
- Wait! We were talking about acrobatics!
- Acrobatics!

148
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,271
l was showing him how to do a backbend.

149
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,188
You never take your eyes off her. You're
always standing under her trapeze,...

150
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,276
..looking up her legs. l see you!

151
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,153
- Because we're planning this routine.
- Sure you are!

152
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,876
What do you take me for anyway?
And l wanted to have a baby with you.

153
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,355
l know. We'll continue this later.

154
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,677
- l know, but l don't wanna have a baby.
- You are such a pig!

155
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,030
- l told you...
- You are a pig.

156
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,709
- l told you a thousand times.
- l don't want a baby with you anyway.

157
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,116
lf you were the last man on earth,
l don't want a baby with you.

158
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,195
Good!

159
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,629
You're never gonna have to see me again!

160
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,479
Good! Good riddance!

161
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,556
l like my freedom.

162
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,188
- What do you want, Kleinman?
- Doctor, l'm sorry.

163
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,871
Can l come in, just for a minute?
Would it be possible? l have a question.

164
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,838
- (Kleinman) Are you in on the plan?
- Of course l am.

165
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,158
- Didn't you think l would be?
- l wanna find out my assignment.

166
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,159
- Please, don't disturb anything.
- No, l wouldn't think of it.

167
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,478
l just wanna find out my participation
in the plan, you know.

168
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,068
Of course, l wouldn't mind
having a little drink.

169
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,351
- A drink?
- You know, the fog. lt's a little damp.

170
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,755
So l, you know...

171
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,758
But not if it's an imposition.

172
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,509
l've never been here before.
This is an interesting...

173
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,276
lt's cheerful.

174
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,836
l'm performing an unusual amount
of autopsies these days.

175
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,157
Yes, l'm sure. That's probably
what accounts for...

176
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,558
..so many of those human fingers lying
around. You don't generally see that.

177
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,992
l guess the maid doesn't get in
that often to straighten up, so...

178
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,194
My interest in all this murder business
is entirely scientific.

179
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,276
l'm sure, l'm sure.

180
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:38,589
l'm determined to use this opportunity
to find out something definitive about...

181
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,075
..the nature of evil.

182
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,558
(doctor) Why is the killer the way he is?

183
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,719
Sometimes certain impulses that
can drive an insane man to murder...

184
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,196
..inspire others to highly creative ends.

185
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,869
Once l have him here, on this table,...

186
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,155
..dismembered and scrutinised
in minute detail,...

187
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,793
..l shall know the answer
with certainty to questions...

188
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,071
..that now l can only speculate on.

189
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,431
Yeah, but it's not possible
that under the microscope...

190
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,869
..there's something
that you could never see?

191
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,039
What are you implying?
A spiritual element?

192
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,118
A soul that lives on after we're dead?

193
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,596
A god?

194
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,160
Ask him if there's anything else.

195
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,475
What are you thinking now?

196
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,469
l just must remember next time
l go out to a restaurant...

197
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,160
..not to order the sweetbreads.

198
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,150
Kleinman, you'd better go.

199
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,919
The time is growing very short.

200
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,397
So there's nothing you can tell me
about my participation in the plan?

201
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,676
l'll go.

202
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,078
The doctor was no help at all.

203
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,556
This is ridiculous. Where is everybody?

204
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,680
Unless... this is part of the plan.

205
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,951
Maybe they have me under surveillance.

206
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,789
lf anything bad happens,
they'll come running out and grab me.

207
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,275
Unless they don´t come running out.

208
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,518
But they could never think
that l'd be any match for a maniac.

209
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,033
A deranged person is supposed
to have the strength of ten men.

210
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,675
l have the strength of... one small boy...

211
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,756
..with polio.

212
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,391
Quiet, quiet, quiet!

213
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,193
lt's Bretschneider. He's been strangled.

214
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,275
Sh!

215
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,755
The killer may still be near.

216
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,749
(Kleinman) Poor Bretschneider.

217
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,836
He had no enemies.

218
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,676
- (coughing)
- (gasps)

219
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,673
- (woman) Don't be afraid.
- Oh!

220
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:53,796
- l'm sorry l scared you.
- Oh, you... you really did scare me.

221
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,435
l didn't see you
standing there in the shadows.

222
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,358
lt's such a foggy night.

223
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,835
l was just going into town.

224
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,639
You should be indoors. lt's not safe.

225
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,115
- (smashing glass)
- l don't care.

226
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,109
What was that?

227
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,196
l don't know.

228
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,510
What are you doing out here tonight?

229
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,189
l'm used to the streets.
lt's how l make my living.

230
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,318
Oh.

231
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,556
What do you do?

232
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,240
Oh, l... l work with the circus.

233
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,313
Well, you should have stayed there.
Don't you know what's lurking in this fog?

234
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,396
l'm never going back.

235
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,036
Oh, l see.

236
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,438
- That's how it is.
- Except l have no place to sleep.

237
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,516
And l'm getting cold.

238
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,597
- l'll find you a place at the house.
- The house?

239
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,632
- The whorehouse.
- Me?

240
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,151
lt's warm. You'll get something to eat.
lt's a lot safer in there than it is out here.

241
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,955
Come on. Stop looking at me like that.
You'll have your privacy.

242
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,953
Hi, everybody. This is lrmy. She's with the
circus. She needs a place to flop tonight.

243
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,516
- What do you do in the circus, huh?
- l'm a sword-swallower.

244
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,108
A sword-swallower?
That's my specialty too.

245
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,196
- She's good at everything.
- Hungry?

246
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,232
- Yes, starving.
- Good. Just in time for dinner.

247
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,555
We got some stew. Come on.

248
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,789
- l don't mind spanking them.
- l do.

249
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,150
But when l have to speak
in the nanny's voice...

250
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,956
The strangest one l ever had was when
l had to make believe that l was twins.

251
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,516
- l've never worked so hard.
- He should've hired the Beckman sisters.

252
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,758
- They cost a fortune, though.
- They're on call to a sultan in Morocco.

253
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,269
Why would any man
want identical whores?

254
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,392
lf you're gonna hire two women,
wouldn't you want variety?

255
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,832
The worst was the businessman
from Budapest and his crazy fantasies.

256
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,316
He sent me out at 3am to see
if l could buy six pounds of butter.

257
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,795
l had to walk him on a leash.

258
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,758
They all look so innocent and dignified
when they walk in here, don't they?

259
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,917
Then you hear the things
they want you to do.

260
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,238
- l think this is shocking lrmy.
- No, no, no. Not at all. No. l was just...

261
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,239
l was just thinking that, for me,
l just don't think it would be possible...

262
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,275
..for me to just take money from someone
and then pretend to feel passion.

263
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,154
- l just don't think l could do it.
- l never thought l could either.

264
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,316
Till my husband needed an operation.

265
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,591
- You're married?
- Yeah. l was.

266
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,918
After he pulled through, realised
how l'd paid the hospital, he left me.

267
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,315
- Good riddance.
- Yeah, good riddance.

268
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,912
(lrmy) So the customers don't mind
that it's just all mechanical?

269
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,600
Without any feeling or anything?

270
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,349
Mind? Ours is the only business that
hasn't been affected by the killings.

271
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,155
There's only one thing
men will brave murder for.

272
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,829
- That little furry animal between our legs.
- Let me tell you something.

273
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,077
Men and women want
very different things out of sex.

274
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,555
They've never forgiven each other.

275
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,069
(lrmy) Where would
you say love came in?

276
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,478
There's only one kind of love that lasts -
unrequited love. lt stays with you for ever.

277
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,354
- You take it from me.
- Oh, Dorry! You're pitiful.

278
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,993
- You don't mean that.
- l do.

279
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,793
- She's just bitter about marriage.
- l am not bitter.

280
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,797
Yeah, you are!

281
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,151
Marriage. Let me tell you gals
somethin' about marriage.

282
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,555
You gotta work at marriage,
like anything else.

283
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,912
- A good marriage takes a lot of work.
- When it starts feeling like work, it's over.

284
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,554
- lt's all luck.
- l hope not.

285
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,753
lt's all luck.
We're all so dependent on luck.

286
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,348
l would rather not admit that,
if you don't mind.

287
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,074
How can it all be luck?

288
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,670
Well, let's say this guy likes to be sat on -

289
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,994
(cackling)

290
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,953
..l'm serious - and ridden around
the room by a naked woman...

291
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,278
..who keeps digging her spurs
into his... into his side.

292
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,551
Yeah, Dorry. Show her your spurs, Dorry.

293
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,554
He meets maybe 50 women and when
he tells them, they faint or they laugh.

294
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,433
- Or both.
- (Dorry) And then they die.

295
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,279
Maybe a few good sports
do it just to please him,...

296
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,358
..but sooner or later they say
''What the hell is this?''

297
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,675
''l'm riding around on a man's back.''

298
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,028
(cackling)

299
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,116
''This is insane.''

300
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,671
''And my spurs are getting,
you know, blunt.''

301
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,075
And then one day he meets a woman
who gets her own erotic pleasure...

302
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,192
..by putting on spurs
and riding men around.

303
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,437
lt's a marriage made in heaven.
Sheer bliss.

304
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,835
- Paul's...
- But what are their chances?

305
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,396
My boyfriend, Paul, he's really sweet.

306
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,193
lt's just that he's an artist, you know.

307
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,154
And a family's death to an artist.

308
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,236
l can understand that.

309
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,995
l'm sure you'd all find him very funny.
He's... really something.

310
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,990
Except when l see him out there, in his
make-up, just getting knocked around...

311
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,432
..and falling into a big tub of water,
with all the people laughing,...

312
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:15,997
..l can only think he must have
suffered so to act like that.

313
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,997
(knocking)

314
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,792
Finally! The rent.

315
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,037
There's more in back.
We're just the welcoming committee.

316
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,720
Does that mean that l have my choice?

317
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,874
- Your credit's always good, Jack.
- Who's the new girl?

318
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,955
She doesn't work here.

319
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,278
- God, she's beautiful.
- She doesn't work here, Jack.

320
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,356
l want her.

321
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,116
Hi.

322
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,435
l'll give you anything you want.

323
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,437
- Me?
- Mm.

324
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,709
Oh!

325
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,277
- No, l'm just spending the night here.
- Well, that's all l plan to do.

326
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,356
Sorry.

327
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,040
- l'll give you $20.
- l'm afraid not.

328
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,473
- 50.
- Sorry.

329
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,636
- 50.
- Not that l'm not flattered.

330
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,320
lt's very nice of you.

331
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,193
- $100.
- Jack, she's not a professional.

332
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,230
$200.

333
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,112
These rich crazies!

334
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,596
University students. They wear you out
before you get to the back room.

335
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,756
l'll give you $500
to spend an hour with me.

336
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,952
l'll spend the rest of the year
with you for $500.

337
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,594
- That is an exorbitant sum.
- You're worth it.

338
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,678
How do you know?
l might be very disappointing.

339
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,594
- 600. Cash.
- What's wrong with you? Can't you hear?

340
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,510
- She said she wasn't interested.
- (lrmy) You just might be a little drunk.

341
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,031
You're the most desirable woman l've
ever met. l wanna make love to you. $700.

342
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,075
- You can have all of us for 700.
- (Dorry) We'll even throw in the dog, too.

343
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,273
- $700, all l won in cards. lt's for you.
- Jack, you're making a fool of yourself.

344
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,198
Some people can't be bought,
not for any amount of money.

345
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,713
You're really the most sensual woman
l've ever seen. lt's a quick $700.

346
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,195
Go right there in the back room.

347
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,716
What do you say?

348
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,790
Let me see the 700.

349
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,876
(women) Whoo!

350
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,836
Can we use the back room?

351
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,916
(laughter)

352
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,756
(footsteps)

353
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,359
- How did you get in?
- Did you think you could keep me out?

354
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,918
So l'm the next on your list?

355
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,996
What list?

356
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,392
l can't quite see your face.

357
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,431
What difference does that make?

358
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,949
Do you think l fear you?

359
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,392
Does that give you pleasure?

360
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,954
Although l admit...

361
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,676
..l was taken a little bit by surprise.

362
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,269
l see... you're very determined.

363
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,435
And yet l feel no fear,...

364
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,438
- ..only pity for you.
- You mean for you.

365
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,915
Why are you doing this?

366
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,109
Oh.

367
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,038
What a foolish question
to ask an irrational mind.

368
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:25,597
- What do you know about my mind?
- l know that if l were to examine...

369
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,678
..the inside of your brain,...

370
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,360
..l should find chaos.

371
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,632
And yet l am anxious to know
where insanity stops and evil begins.

372
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,796
(killer) So many questions.

373
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,876
(smashing glass)

374
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,395
(doctor) No!

375
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,476
No! No!

376
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,236
(doctor screams)

377
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,754
Well, you're $700 richer.

378
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,471
You can start a new life.

379
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,556
God, l'm thirsty.

380
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,916
You were wonderful.

381
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,078
lt's not necessary that l be wonderful.
l was paying.

382
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,156
(lrmy) Still.

383
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,355
Listen, tell me the truth.

384
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,837
Did you close your eyes and grit
your teeth and think of the cash?

385
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,316
Well, at first l did, yes.

386
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,955
But then l think l just relaxed into it.

387
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,275
Now l feel so strange, though.

388
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,356
Strange in what way?

389
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,233
l don't know. Not like me.

390
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,196
Not like you.

391
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,993
Or was it the real you for the first time?

392
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,596
Come on. Where's the next one?

393
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,153
Come on. Hurry up.

394
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,636
- What is this? What's going on?
- Social undesirables.

395
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,479
The police said they may be
involved in the killings.

396
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,910
That's the Mintz family. l know them.
They're lovely people.

397
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,157
He does quality circumcisions.
l've seen his work.

398
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,794
lf l were you, l'd mind my own business.

399
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,799
Well, this is crazy. They can't be
responsible for the killings.

400
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,115
l'm gonna speak to the chief of police.

401
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:28,189
My theory is that if they take them to jail,
all these killings might stop.

402
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,948
(clears throat)

403
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,071
Kleinman. Did you wanna speak to me?

404
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,191
- Would that be possible?
- Sit down.

405
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,436
- Thank you.
- You're up rather late.

406
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,154
- l know.
- Don't you have to work tomorrow?

407
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,510
Yes, l do have to go to work, but l...

408
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,154
You're not involved with
one of those street gangs?

409
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,555
No. The vigilantes?

410
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,432
Oh, you know?

411
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,710
Well, you hear stories, but...

412
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,751
- l'm against them.
- l am too.

413
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,552
Good.

414
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,114
What did you want? l'm very busy.

415
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,631
l don't wanna take up any of your time.
l just wanted to discuss the Mintz family.

416
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,753
Oh, yes. Unfortunate. There may be
a connection between all these killings...

417
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,270
..and certain well-poisoning incidents.
You understand.

418
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:21,359
But those accusations are so wrong.
l mean, they're just not true.

419
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,870
Maybe they are, maybe they're not.
What do you know about it?

420
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,993
l don't know anything. l myself have
no personal knowledge of anything.

421
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,193
- But the Mintzes are lovely people.
- Don't look so apprehensive, Kleinman.

422
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,677
lt'll probably never go any deeper
than the more orthodox elements.

423
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,675
- Nobody's guilty of anything.
- Kleinman, there's pressure on me...

424
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,678
..to get to the bottom of the killings.
Not worried, are you?

425
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,839
No one lumps you in with the Mintzes.
You're fine. So don't get your nose dirty.

426
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,633
Besides, l have my own theories
about what's going on.

427
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,399
The doctor's been murdered.

428
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,830
We think there may be someone
trying to copy the murderer.

429
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,235
We found a glass with fingerprints on it.

430
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,634
- What kind?
- Sherry glass.

431
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,273
- How many prints?
- A lot.

432
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,392
- Prints on the glass?
- Fingerprints all over the glass.

433
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,919
OK, l'm coming. You don't have to
push me. Will you just let go of me?

434
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,113
How many times do l have to tell you?
l don't work at the brothel!

435
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,357
- What's this?
- Turning tricks at Felice's place.

436
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,870
- l work at the circus.
- Stand there. She's loaded with cash.

437
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,514
- Where's a dame like you get big money?
- Well, l...

438
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,074
Yeah, we know. What did you do?
The whole regiment?

439
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,512
- Very funny. l work at the circus.
- You'd think they'd cool off with all this.

440
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,677
l haven't seen you before,
so l'm gonna go easy on you. $50 fine.

441
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,030
- l don't work at the brothel.
- Uh-huh?

442
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,628
OK, OK. Here.

443
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,752
$50. $50. OK.
But l don't work at the brothel.

444
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,474
- Let me give you a piece of advice.
- Can l go home now?

445
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,720
You don't solicit without a licence. We
like things hygienic and well-regulated.

446
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,990
- l'll do a receipt.
- l don't need a licence.

447
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,712
- What's your name?
- lrmy.

448
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,152
- How do you spell it?
- l-r-m-y. l don't need a licence.

449
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,114
Just pipe down. You're not getting
a licence. You're getting a receipt.

450
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,993
- You work here, you need a licence.
- This is ridiculous.

451
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,316
(door slams)

452
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,396
- (lrmy) What are you staring at?
- Me?

453
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,080
- l'm not a whore.
- What did l say?

454
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,919
Do l care what your hobbies are?

455
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,395
l... l'm just... You know...

456
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,954
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

457
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,435
lt's not safe to be out on the street tonight.

458
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,916
- Then what are you doing out?
- l'm part of a citizens' committee...

459
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,112
..to patrol the streets, so it's OK for me.

460
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:27,438
- Are you from around here?
- No, l'm with the circus.

461
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,949
The circus? Really?

462
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,878
l saw the circus. Which one are you?

463
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,151
- l'm the sword-swallower.
- l didn't recognise you.

464
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,953
- You look completely different.
- l know.

465
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,197
l wear a beautiful costume
and my hair is different.

466
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,710
l went to see Almstead the magician
because he's a favourite of mine.

467
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,230
l'm an amateur magician myself.
Just something l do in my spare time.

468
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,353
- l idolise him. He's a great artist.
- Yeah, he's an artist... when he's sober.

469
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,278
- Well, you know...
- ls there a hotel around here?

470
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,710
- l had a fight with my boyfriend.
- lt's late.

471
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,718
So when you have the sword
down your throat,...

472
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,115
..what happens if you get hiccups?

473
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,197
Jesus. l don't know my way
around this part of town.

474
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,393
l don't think there's gonna be
a hotel open at this hour.

475
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,193
l'll wake up my fiancée
and you could sleep on the sofa.

476
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,118
- l don't wanna wake anyone up.
- She would be glad to.

477
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,708
You know, it's... it's so foggy.

478
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,195
He strikes in the fog, you know.

479
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,997
- You didn't hear anything, did you?
- You're so tense.

480
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:43,238
Well, l'm usually in bed,
you know, this time of night.

481
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,875
What would you do if you came
face to face with the killer?

482
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,956
l'd throw pepper in his eyes.

483
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,436
My landlady put
some pepper in my pocket.

484
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,791
- l think l could handle myself.
- Kleinman!

485
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,310
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, my God! You scared me.

486
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,238
- Who is she?
- She's just a friend.

487
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,319
- Do you happen to know my assignment?
- Who gave you permission to socialise?

488
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,592
l'm not socialising. Maybe
you recognise her. She's with the circus.

489
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,676
She's the sword-swallower.

490
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,633
She's unescorted.
l was just walking next to her.

491
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,355
- We're getting closer to the zero hour.
- Yeah? So what do l do?

492
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,675
- Don't you know?
- No. That's the point.

493
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,553
You got me up, and no one's told me
what l'm supposed to do.

494
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,593
l swear, if anyone is killed or hurt
as a result of your incompetence...

495
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,871
l don't know enough to be incompetent.
They don't tell me what...

496
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,755
Don't make a noise, and listen to me.
There is someone lurking up the alley.

497
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,073
Well...

498
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,432
Shall l just start weeping or would
you like me to break into a run?

499
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,552
- We can trap whoever it is.
- No! l don't wanna trap anybody.

500
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,716
We'll get reinforcements.

501
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,195
What they say about you isn't true, is it?

502
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:55,677
You're not really a coward
or a worm or a yellow-belly?

503
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,558
No, but keep going.
You're in the right column.

504
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,240
l'll circle around the block.
You head up the alley.

505
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,511
- l don't wanna do this. This is trouble.
- l can go with you.

506
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,076
No! She's gonna go with me! What good
are you? You're a small woman.

507
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,838
l'm OK.

508
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,476
You go first. lt'll throw
his timing off if he sees a body.

509
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,037
Go on, Kleinman. lt'll take me a moment
or two to get round the other side.

510
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,916
(Kleinman) Keep ahead of me.

511
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,954
(lrmy) Sh!

512
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,116
Those are my knees knocking.

513
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,673
Stay calm. The trick is not to show fear.

514
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,909
(lrmy) There he is! Look!

515
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,315
Grab him! Grab him!

516
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,396
(dog barks)

517
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,157
- Kleinman!
- Mr Paulsen!

518
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,510
- You know him?
- This is my boss.

519
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,154
- What are you doing?
- l'm part of the plan, Your Grace.

520
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,350
- Why did you attack me?
- l thought...

521
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,189
- ''Thought''? Since when do you think?
- Yes, you're right, Your Majesty.

522
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,552
l had a suspicion you were incompetent,
hiding behind your co-workers.

523
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,832
Don't let him talk to you like that! He was
peeping at that woman getting undressed!

524
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,235
- How dare you!
- Don't listen to her, sir.

525
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,875
- She's swallowed sharp objects.
- Don't be a doormat for a Peeping Tom.

526
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,594
- This is my boss.
- To think that l was undecided...

527
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,157
- ..about your abilities versus Simon Carr.
- What can l say? You looked dangerous.

528
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,034
- l didn't know you were peeping.
- What about your function in the plan?

529
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,311
- l don't know my function.
- You unreliable simpleton!

530
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,635
- Don't call him a simpleton.
- lt was well put.

531
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,911
- You're a disgusting old man!
- No, don't say that. Go away, Miss.

532
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,157
Whoever you are, go away.
Go away, go away. Leave us alone.

533
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,229
Paulsen? You gave us quite a scare. l sent
Kleinman round here to check you out.

534
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,316
He was just looking in the window.

535
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,750
- Mark my words: he'll be a detriment.
- No, sir. Don't say that.

536
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,678
- Let me block your hat.
- Give me that!

537
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:10,713
He's always been a liability with my firm.
l'm only just beginning to realise it.

538
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,479
Mr Paulsen, l didn't mean it! You...

539
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,352
Sir!

540
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,476
(clown) lrmy!

541
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,596
lrmy!

542
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,558
- We're closing.
- Just one beer? Please?

543
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:59,596
Did anyone see a blonde woman
wandering around alone?

544
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,790
Short hair?

545
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,549
Oh, mercy. We never know
when we have a good thing.

546
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,114
We always have to ruin it.

547
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,993
l know exactly how you feel.

548
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,953
The earthly paradise known as woman.

549
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,435
All we'll ever know of heaven.

550
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,675
All we need know of hell.

551
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,192
l made love to a woman tonight
that was sheer perfection.

552
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:30,110
lt was in a brothel, but somehow this one
didn't have that used, jaded quality.

553
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,597
l never do it with whores.
You start out with a burning desire...

554
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,350
..and end up the next day with a burning
sensation, if you know what l mean.

555
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,756
Yes, but this one was so irresistible.

556
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,348
Sweet and innocent.

557
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,631
But under the sheets... a tigress.

558
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,355
A violent, screaming,
passionate jungle cat.

559
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,193
- You mean a good actress.
- She swore not.

560
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,554
Well, you're very young,
my friend. Very naive.

561
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,353
- She dug her nails into my back.
- l'm sure.

562
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,710
And then she yelled ''Don't stop!''

563
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,435
Yes. And stuck her tongue
inside my mouth and wiggled it around.

564
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,677
l'm sure it was well worth the $20.

565
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,519
20? l paid her 700.

566
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,313
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Tell me another one.

567
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,194
l'm afraid you've never
made love with a sword-swallower.

568
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,236
l beg your pardon?

569
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,068
She claims she never took money before.
lf she was acting, she should win a prize.

570
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:40,273
lt's true l put on a heroic performance,
if l do say so myself.

571
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,470
She brought out the stallion in me.

572
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,070
And when she said she loved it,
l believe she was sincere.

573
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,113
l think she's got a lover who doesn't
service her too well, you know?

574
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,435
Some poor clown.

575
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,438
But l showed her
what a good one felt like.

576
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,950
What's wrong? You look incredulous.

577
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,595
l swear, the dirtier l got,
the more she screamed.

578
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,475
l gave her the best time she's had
in years, and l believe she loved it.

579
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,797
Not that l have any further
urge for her, you know.

580
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,071
The difference between
love and lust, l guess.

581
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,072
When my friend wakes up,
tell him l went back to Felice's.

582
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,109
This is crazy. Can't l talk you out of it?

583
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,516
No, l don't want it.
l want the church to have it, all of it.

584
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,668
- But you're talking about $700.
- $650. l had to pay a fine.

585
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,109
But it's your money.

586
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,471
- Why give it away?
- Because l'm ashamed of the way l got it.

587
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,469
- Listen, l'm sure you didn't steal it.
- No. l slept with somebody for it.

588
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,872
Just one person.
Does that make me a whore?

589
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,389
Well, only by the dictionary definition.

590
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,310
- Anyway, l'm giving it to the church.
- Yeah, but that seems so silly.

591
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,035
lt's work, you know.
l'm sure you didn't do it for fun.

592
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,516
No. But you know something?
lt turned out to be fun.

593
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:11,429
Here. Would you take it in there for me
and give it to them? For the poor.

594
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,597
l just can't bring myself
to go in there tonight.

595
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,075
Please? Come on.

596
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,751
- Yes?
- l just need a minute of your time.

597
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,599
l think you can see that we're busy.

598
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,599
- l just... Just for one...
- Put Kramer's name on the list.

599
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,871
Have you seen his sketches
and his photo studies?

600
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,037
Just for a minute,
if l might have your attention...

601
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,720
Didn't you hear him say we're busy?

602
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,158
- Are you Kleinman?
- Yes. Yes, l am. Yes.

603
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,996
Don't forget.

604
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,396
Why is he putting my name on the list?

605
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,069
- You've been warned twice now.
- What is this list? Might l just ask?

606
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,919
- l have a donation to make.
- The poor box is in the front.

607
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,315
No, this doesn't fit in the poor box.

608
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,991
- Kleinman, you want me to take you in?
- No, no, no. l have $650.

609
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,112
- $650.
- lt's not stolen. He thinks it's stolen.

610
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,994
- Where did you get it?
- My friend said l should donate it.

611
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,351
- Where did your friend get it?
- We don't have to pry excessively.

612
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:22,677
We humbly accept this token
from the faithful.

613
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,951
And l think that we know
how to show gratitude...

614
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,038
..when someone performs
an act of charity.

615
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,790
(priest) Manna for the poor.

616
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,549
- (lrmy) Did you do it?
- (Kleinman) Yeah, l took care of it.

617
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,795
- l feel so much better now.
- Good.

618
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,512
Are you a religious person?

619
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,916
Me? No, l'm not. You're
the second person tonight to ask that.

620
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,474
The doctor - may he rest in peace -
wanted to know.

621
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,989
- Do you pray ever?
- No.

622
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,510
My people pray in a different language,
so l never understood.

623
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,677
For all l know, they were
requesting their own troubles.

624
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,950
- (baby crying)
- (woman) Help me.

625
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,430
Please help me.

626
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,518
- Help.
- (lrmy) Are you all right?

627
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,757
- (Kleinman) Who is that?
- l'm hungry.

628
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,235
l need to buy food and milk.

629
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,516
My husband is dead.

630
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,954
- l'm alone.
- We're friends.

631
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,719
You know, you're among friends.

632
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,115
Go back and get some of the money back.

633
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,357
- What are you talking about?
- l want her to have half of it.

634
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,792
- l can't. l just gave them the money.
- So what? Just ask for half back.

635
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,037
You just gave it to them.
They give it to the poor, don't they?

636
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,118
Well, theoretically they do,
but a lot of it is used...

637
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,676
..to buy costumes
and velvet pillows and stuff.

638
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,756
Please.

639
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,395
My friend asked me
if l could possibly come...

640
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:58,152
..and just have half the money back
that l gave you. Just $300. lt would...

641
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,236
Thank you.

642
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,478
Kleinman. ls that with an ''ei'' or an ''ie''?

643
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,556
Put a circle around it.

644
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,273
Eve. Eve, open up.

645
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,231
lt's Kleinman.

646
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,749
Eve. Eve, it's an emergency.

647
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,678
- lt's me. lt's Max.
- (lrmy) This is a bad idea.

648
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,678
No, she's a wonderful girl.
Very intelligent.

649
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,755
Eve!

650
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,077
Eve!

651
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,794
What are doing here at this hour?
Who is this?

652
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,639
- Can we come in?
- What's going on?

653
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,320
She's a friend of mine.
She has no place to sleep.

654
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,910
- l told her she could sleep on your sofa.
- You did?

655
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,749
(lrmy) We're sorry. lt's much
too much of an imposition.

656
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,314
You dare to wake me out of a deep sleep...

657
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,910
..so that some complete stranger
can sleep on my sofa?

658
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:53,237
She's not a complete stranger.
She's a friend.

659
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,476
Eve, l personally vouch for her.

660
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,239
l apologise, Miss.

661
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:01,079
- Kleinman, have you been drinking?
- Have l been...?

662
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,875
- When do l ever drink?
- Since when is she your friend?

663
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,958
Since tonight. l met her
at the police headquarters.

664
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,719
They brought her in
when they raided the brothel.

665
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:15,914
lt's not what it sounds like. Everybody
makes one mistake now and then.

666
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,315
Kleinman, what are you
doing out at this hour?

667
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,716
l'm part of a vigilante committee
to help catch the maniac.

668
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,956
By doing what?

669
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,036
l don't exactly know.

670
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:30,516
Go home, Kleinman.
And take your friend with you.

671
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,234
You've got some nerve.
We'll discuss this in the morning.

672
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,353
(Kleinman) Boy, Eve is a cold fish.

673
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,596
There. l said it.

674
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,759
(lrmy) ls it hard for you to admit
certain things to yourself?

675
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,351
Usually it is, yes.
But for some reason tonight is different.

676
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,109
You know, it's a strange feeling
to be up at this hour.

677
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,471
The city is so odd
when everybody's asleep.

678
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:05,036
lt's like a different place completely.
There's no civilisation.

679
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,118
The stores are closed.
You know, it's so free.

680
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,994
lt's an odd feeling for me.

681
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,671
l feel l could run down the street
naked and nobody would...

682
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,236
(lrmy) lt has a really free feeling.

683
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,830
(Kleinman) l've never seen it from
up here, never taken the time to look.

684
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:27,032
lt's so pretty. Some of the stars
are beginning to come up.

685
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,197
The fog is just breaking a tiny bit.

686
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,150
(lrmy) You see that very bright star
up in that direction?

687
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,315
Mm-hm.

688
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,399
For all we know, that star could have
disappeared a million years ago,...

689
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,355
..and it's taken the light from it
a million years to reach us.

690
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,472
So what are you saying?
That star is not there?

691
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,556
That it might not be there.

692
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,750
Even though l can see it
with my own eyes?

693
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,836
That's right.

694
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,872
That's a very disquieting thought,
you know.

695
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,356
When l see something,
l like to know that it's actually there.

696
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:05,439
Otherwise a person could sit down
in a chair and break his neck.

697
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,950
You have to be able to rely on things.
lt's very important.

698
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,753
You know who has these thoughts?
Schultz the tailor.

699
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,871
He thinks nothing is real at all,...

700
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,754
..and that everything exists
only in the dream of a dog.

701
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,110
But this is real, isn't it?

702
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,596
And beautiful.
Just think about it for a minute.

703
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,679
Here we are, we're two strangers,
and we're out in the night, and it's just...

704
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,268
..so peaceful and quiet.

705
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,838
Suddenly there's a little clearing in the fog
and we can see right out to the stars.

706
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,839
Doesn't this moment just seem perfect?

707
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,476
Yes, but, you know,
it... it... passes so quickly.

708
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,637
Look. Even now the fog
is starting to go back in.

709
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,672
Everything's always moving all the time.

710
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,430
Everything's constantly in motion,
so it's no wonder that l'm nauseous.

711
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:00,315
My father used to say
''We're all happy if we only knew it.''

712
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,598
Kleinman! We've been
looking all over for you.

713
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,157
l've been wandering around in the fog. l'm
waiting for Hacker to tell me what to do.

714
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,477
- Hacker's dead.
- The killer got Hacker?

715
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,991
- Hacker wasn't murdered by the maniac.
- Well, who then?

716
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,874
- Someone from the other faction.
- Since when did we have other factions?

717
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,833
People have their own ideas
about how to achieve results.

718
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:29,316
Naturally, there's tension.
Miller formed his own group.

719
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,830
- But so quickly it becomes violent?
- Hacker asked for it.

720
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,873
He was stubborn and hot-headed, despite
the fact that his plan wasn't working.

721
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,753
You sound like you didn't
agree with him either.

722
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,155
- l'm with Vogel's group.
- Who's Vogel?

723
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,271
Since when is there a third group?

724
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,960
There's disagreement
on how to handle things!

725
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,958
The last thing we need is disagreement.
We should be...

726
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:54,596
Don't lecture me, Kleinman!
Are you with us or against us?

727
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,393
l don't know. l don't have
enough facts so l can choose.

728
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,750
Now listen, Kleinman.

729
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,348
Lives are at stake.
You have to make a choice!

730
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,994
You can't threaten him!
Don't take this from him!

731
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:07,270
- She's starting already.
- Who's this?

732
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,516
There you are.
Where the hell have you been?

733
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,393
Where have you been? You wake me
in the middle of the night.

734
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:16,274
- Now l hear Hacker's dead.
- You wandered off when we needed you.

735
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,075
- You didn't tell me anything.
- Kleinman's joined our faction.

736
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,079
- ls that true, Kleinman?
- No. Look, we have to cooperate.

737
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,715
- Are you with them or us?
- l don't know. How can l know?

738
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,274
l don't know what the alternatives are.

739
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,870
ls one apples, is one pears?
Are they both tangerines?

740
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,389
Let's kill him before
he gives everything away.

741
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:38,909
l don't know anything.
l can't give anything away.

742
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:42,032
We're here arguing and there's
an enemy out there killing us.

743
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,594
Soon we're gonna do his killing for him.

744
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,713
- The murderer!
- He believes he's located the guilty party.

745
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,070
lt's Spiro, the great clairvoyant.

746
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,634
l've heard of him.
He's solved a lot of cases.

747
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,194
They say all he needs
is something to sniff or feel.

748
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,311
He's solved some kidnappings.

749
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,796
Mr Spiro is on the verge
of revealing the killer.

750
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,873
Mr Spiro wishes to sniff you.

751
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,556
- Me?
- Yes.

752
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:16,637
- Well, how come?
- lt's enough he wishes it.

753
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,796
No! No, don't let him do it.

754
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,799
Hey, wasn't that woman booked on
prostitution charges earlier tonight?

755
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,673
- Come on, Kleinman.
- l don't wanna get sniffed.

756
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,870
Come on!

757
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,151
- l don't wanna be sniffed! No!
- Stand still.

758
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,239
- Go ahead, sniff away.
- This is crazy. Why should he sniff me?

759
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,155
What is this man sniffing?

760
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,637
lt's probably cheese, cos tonight was the
night l changed the traps in the bedroom.

761
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,671
- Frightened?
- l'm not frightened.

762
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,110
This is unfair. Kleinman,
stand up for your rights!

763
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,198
l know what he's sniffing.
lt's salad dressing.

764
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,118
l spilled salad dressing
on myself this evening.

765
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,392
My landlady cooks for me, so she made
me a nice salad with a little whitefish.

766
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,114
She makes beautiful whitefish.
l can't have meat...

767
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,835
- Shut up!
- This man has something in his pocket.

768
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,235
Mr Spiro has done it again.

769
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:14,114
- Look in his pocket.
- l have nothing. There's nothing.

770
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,196
Check his inside pocket.

771
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,391
This was stolen from
police headquarters earlier tonight.

772
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,990
- This is stolen property.
- l carry a glass with me. l get thirsty.

773
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,476
- l like to have, you know, occasionally...
- We've trapped him!

774
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,670
Why'd you do it? You killed the doctor!

775
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,394
Do what? You believe this guy
from smelling me?

776
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,717
Mr Spiro's uncanny power
has never failed him yet.

777
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,549
Why would l kill the doctor?
The man took out my gall bladder.

778
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,558
- With my consent.
- Don't expect him to make sense.

779
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,639
That's how it is with a psychopath. They
can be logical on every point except one:

780
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,354
Their weakness, their point of insanity.

781
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,393
- And Kleinman's always so damn logical.
- This is a joke, isn't it?

782
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:58,593
We're all reasonable,
normal, rational people, right?

783
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,517
Tell me where you got this.

784
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,837
Once again l thank the Lord
for the special gift...

785
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,315
..he has seen fit to bestow on me.

786
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,159
l say we make an example of him.
Who has a rope?

787
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,511
No, you can't do this!
Kleinman, defend yourself!

788
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,234
- They're picking on me.
- How do you plead, Kleinman?

789
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:19,638
Not guilty! l plead not guilty. l never did
anything in my life to deserve any trouble.

790
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,309
- lf anything, l deserve a bonus.
- Come on! Let's get him.

791
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,675
Where'd he get that pepper?

792
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,836
Let me in. lt's Max.

793
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,596
- Who is it?
- Max. Max.

794
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,956
- Max. Let me in.
- Max?

795
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,799
Yes! l have to come in. They're after me.

796
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,989
Max.

797
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,874
Stop staring at me. l'm not a ghost.
Not yet, although they're trying to kill me.

798
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,831
- Who?
- There's a mob.

799
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,951
And you dare to come here?

800
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:55,790
What could l do? l'm running for my life,
and l saw your place and, you know, l...

801
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,151
Whatever they think about you,
l'm sure you're guilty of it.

802
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,750
Alma, is it possible
that l could murder somebody?

803
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,111
Alma, l'm asking you a question.
lt's me, Max.

804
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,800
l never wanted to lay eyes on you again.

805
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:12,390
l know. l did a bad thing.
But time heals. lt's been years.

806
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,512
The more l thought about it,
the more l wanted you dead.

807
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,154
Cut in little pieces and thrown to the dogs.

808
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:21,158
Jesus. You've given this thing
some very specific thought.

809
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,478
You're the worst scum,
and l won't rest until you fry in hell.

810
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,795
Can l stay here tonight? ls it...?

811
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,957
How could you do it?
How could you leave me at the altar,...

812
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,152
..in front of family and friends,
humiliated and weeping?

813
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,999
l've explained that.
There's two sides to every story.

814
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,111
Do you deny we were to be married...

815
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,834
..and you made an idiot of me
in front of everyone?

816
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:45,475
l was nervous.
l was a little drunk. l was unsure.

817
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,433
- Unsure?
- lt was your idea to get married.

818
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:52,519
- And it was your idea to get me pregnant.
- lt was a hysterical pregnancy.

819
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,949
- You weren't actually pregnant.
- So what?

820
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,834
- Will you keep quiet? l'm trying to hide.
- We looked everywhere.

821
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,872
My father, my mother, my brothers.
''Where could he be?''

822
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,310
''He was here before the ceremony.
True, he was drinking.''

823
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,000
Listen, l know what you're gonna say.

824
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,237
While everybody's walking around,
puzzled and muttering,...

825
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:15,797
..sensing my discomfort,
he's discovered in a broom closet,...

826
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,956
..making love with my sister.

827
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:20,674
Jesus. l thought l explained that to you.

828
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,314
What kind of explanation
could you possibly have?

829
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,273
You were naked in the closet
with my sister!

830
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,789
Look at her.
She still holds that against me.

831
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,311
lt's not that l didn't like you. l just didn't
love you. l thought you were pregnant.

832
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:36,671
- l was trying to do the honourable thing.
- The honourable thing?

833
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,836
To desert me at the altar...

834
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,909
..and make love with my younger sister
in a broom closet is the honourable thing?

835
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,600
Look, we just had
your best interests at heart.

836
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,109
l want you dead, and her.

837
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,550
Don't. She was a wonderful girl.
She's fabulous. She loved you.

838
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:56,389
She worshipped you like a goddess.
She was singing your praises.

839
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,478
- Till the moment l slipped her pants off...
- Get out of here!

840
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,989
Be careful with that. Be angry with me.

841
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:06,193
All right, fault me. But not Trudy.
Not Trudy, l beg of you. Not your sister.

842
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:10,029
l convinced her to do it. She didn't
wanna do it. l promised to get her steaks.

843
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,993
Kleinman's here! Here he is!

844
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,678
Kleinman's here!

845
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:19,749
Get out and die! Get out! Die!
You rot in hell, you filthy vermin!

846
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,429
lt's good to see you're not bitter
after all these years.

847
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,519
- (screams)
- You whore!

848
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,599
- l'll kill you!
- You're the one who should be ashamed!

849
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:44,553
How could you? With a student
for a few silver coins?

850
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,194
lt wasn't a few silver coins.
He gave me $700.

851
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:50,676
- You didn't know what you were doing.
- l enjoyed myself.

852
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,030
l'll kill you!

853
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,833
- l hate you!
- l was drunk. l was miserable.

854
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,633
l hate you! l hate you! l'll kill you!

855
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,320
l wish we'd never met. Come home.

856
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,557
- l never want to see you again.
- He was young and handsome.

857
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:07,831
- Yes, he was!
- And you enjoyed yourself?

858
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,509
- Was he a better lover than me?
- He treated me romantically.

859
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:14,757
But he felt nothing! Just lust, pure lust.

860
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,190
- l don't care to talk about it.
- l'm sure you don't. Where's the money?

861
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:21,232
- l gave it to charity.
- You're joking!

862
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,430
You don't think l'm worth $700?

863
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:26,950
There isn't a whore
in the world worth $700,...

864
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:30,038
..especially not
an amateur whore like you.

865
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:33,076
- Bastard!
- (woman screams)

866
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,156
What's that?

867
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,676
- l'm scared.
- Don't panic.

868
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,552
Hold me.

869
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,636
l'll protect you.

870
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,396
lt is rather scary.

871
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,395
(clown) Oh, my God! lt's gruesome.

872
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,276
- Oh, God!
- Be quiet.

873
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,956
(yowling)

874
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:15,917
(footsteps)

875
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,996
- l hear footsteps.
- Quiet.

876
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,156
- Listen.
- They're getting fainter.

877
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,432
- Quick, we have to get out of here.
- Wait. Do you hear something?

878
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,311
(baby crying)

879
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,796
The same woman. The same woman l...

880
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,833
l saw her earlier.
We gave her some money.

881
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,315
She had a baby with her.

882
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:54,549
- lt's too horrible to think about.
- ls she all right?

883
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,235
The poor little thing.

884
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,989
- We'll have to keep the baby.
- What? What are you talking about?

885
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,475
- She has no one.
- What about her father?

886
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,909
- No. There is none.
- How do you know?

887
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,999
l talked to the woman earlier.
There's no father, there's no family.

888
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:15,749
- She has no one. She was all alone.
- We can't keep a baby.

889
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:18,713
- You want to just leave her in the gutter?
- No, but...

890
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,229
But what? She needs parents.

891
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:24,158
- Yes, but...
- Stop ''yes, butting'' and ''no, butting''.

892
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,193
l wanted a baby.
Now God has dropped one in my lap.

893
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,471
- We have no money.
- No, we do. Come here.

894
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,992
Look. You just hold her for a second.

895
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,874
- l can't.
- Just hold her for a second. Be careful.

896
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,995
- Here. Maybe...
- (fluttering)

897
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,475
Don't put her on the ground!

898
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,428
Here.

899
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,312
- $300.
- lt's not legal.

900
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:02,956
- We have to give her to an orphanage.
- How are they gonna treat her?

901
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:06,959
She needs love and care.
She needs a mother and a father.

902
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,992
- lt's out of the question.
- Well, l´m gonna keep her.

903
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:14,557
No. You're gonna put her back where
l found her, and we'll inform the police.

904
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,797
- Help!
- Quiet! The killer could be lurking.

905
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,276
You don't have to,
but l'm gonna raise this baby.

906
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,990
She's so tiny.

907
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:30,476
- She's pretty.
- l didn't say she wasn't pretty.

908
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,155
This is madness. Madness.

909
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,396
She is beautiful.

910
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:43,558
Oh, God. Oh, God.

911
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,876
He must have come down here.

912
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:59,355
- Anybody look down there?
- He's gotta be over here.

913
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,277
Or maybe down the stairway.

914
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,879
Try down here.

915
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,116
He must be down there.

916
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,196
Down the stairs.

917
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,437
l didn't mean to interrupt.
l just wanna rest for a minute.

918
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:32,074
Come in, come in. You're welcome.

919
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:36,193
lt's late. There's no one here but us.
What's your name, sweetheart?

920
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:38,276
- Kleinman.
- Sit down, Mr Kleinman.

921
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,279
- Let me get you something to drink.
- Jack's one of our regulars.

922
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,631
l find this atmosphere a lot more
stimulating than university.

923
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,639
- As long as we do the stimulating.
- (Dorry) That's right.

924
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,991
l was pointing out to these ladies
the metaphors of perversion.

925
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,076
Oh, my goodness. Such big words.

926
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,636
The chief magistrate likes me
to tie him up, hand and foot.

927
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,796
Exactly. You take away his freedom...

928
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,117
..and he becomes blissful,
delighted, sexually aroused.

929
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,994
- He's frightened of his freedom.
- What's he frightened of?

930
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,078
Who knows? Whatever his impulses are.

931
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,749
- Power, lust, murder.
- There are laws against murder.

932
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:19,078
- Haven't you heard about that?
- Certain people obey only their own laws.

933
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:22,476
ls that what they teach you
at the university? To be superior?

934
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,431
No, no, no, no.

935
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,791
We learn facts. Nothing but facts.

936
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,876
Logic...

937
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,393
..and mathematics
and how to become depressed.

938
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,034
Your problem is
you don't believe in anything.

939
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,152
Spoken by a true whore
who believes only in cash.

940
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:43,432
Better false gods than no god at all, hm?

941
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,199
Here's a thoughtful-looking man.

942
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:49,676
What are your views on divine matters?

943
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,349
- Excuse me. Me?
- (Jack) l'm asking if you believe in God.

944
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:59,198
lt's incredible. That's the third time tonight
somebody asked me that exact question.

945
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,039
l would love to, believe me.
l know l would be happier.

946
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:04,390
- (Jack) Yeah, but you can't.
- l can't. No.

947
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:08,069
You doubt his existence and you can't
make the leap of faith necessary.

948
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,397
l can't make the leap of faith
to believe in my own existence.

949
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,796
- Here's your drink, Kleinman.
- (Jack) You keep making jokes...

950
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,878
..until the moment comes
when you've really gotta face death.

951
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,150
Why are we on such a morbid subject?

952
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,953
- That's the future.
- (Jack) ls it the future?

953
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,914
The trick is to have as much as wine,
as many men and laughs as you can...

954
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,555
..until they carry you out in a pine box,
and then don't go easily.

955
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:33,240
l wanna die in my sleep
without ever knowing.

956
01:05:33,360 --> 01:05:37,478
Some world, when the nicest gift you wish
for someone is that they die in their sleep.

957
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,195
lf l thought that there was nothing
except this, l'd kill myself.

958
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,596
l've thought of it. Believe me,
there have been many times...

959
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,950
..when my brain has said ''Why not?''

960
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,833
l mean, there's no point to anything.

961
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,429
But somehow my blood
always said ''Live! Live!''

962
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,275
And l always listen to my blood.

963
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:03,350
How about you, Kleinman?

964
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,029
You know, l know exactly
what l think about all this,...

965
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,720
..but l can never find words to put it in.

966
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,195
Maybe if l get a little drunk
l could dance it.

967
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:17,314
Come on, honey. l know what's on your
mind. Come on. Let's go to the bedroom.

968
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,030
l've never paid for sex in my life.

969
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,515
You just think you haven't.

970
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,036
Enjoy yourself, Kleinman.

971
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,677
May all your ups and downs be in bed.

972
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,836
You're in a peculiar mood.

973
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:36,030
That little circus performer.

974
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:39,436
You still haven't gotten her
out of your mind.

975
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:41,869
lsn't that odd?

976
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,355
A moment's chance encounter.

977
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:48,552
Business transaction with a total stranger.

978
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,035
l mean, we barely spoke.

979
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,276
And yet tonight l feel like
l've lost something.

980
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,428
l'm so sorry.
This never happened to me before.

981
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,755
l never have any problem.
lt's so humiliating.

982
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:08,633
- What's the matter? Don't you like me?
- lt isn't that.

983
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,716
lt's that conversation we were having.

984
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:14,799
- Maybe we should try a new position.
- Believe me, it isn't the position.

985
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:19,357
l've used this position before, many times,
and it has always worked very effectively.

986
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,869
Sometimes within a matter of seconds.

987
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,197
Some men are looking for you.
We can't have any trouble here.

988
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:28,278
- ls there another way out?
- The roof. Hurry.

989
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,398
What's that?

990
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,158
Behind here.

991
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,236
Down there.

992
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:47,755
(door creaks)

993
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:51,111
Simon Carr. What are you doing here?

994
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:55,153
- l'm part of Nagel's plan.
- Nagel has a plan too?

995
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:59,239
Everybody has a plan. l'm the only one in
town that doesn't know what he's doing.

996
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,477
By the way, Kleinman,
l ran into Mr Paulsen before.

997
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:05,398
He's giving me the promotion.

998
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,158
He said that?

999
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,317
Actually, he said that he sees you...

1000
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,716
..as a kind of cringing, slimy vermin...

1001
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,753
..more suited to extermination
than life on this planet.

1002
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:20,633
l don't think he means it personally.

1003
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,556
Carr, did you happen
to see a young woman...

1004
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,672
..with a big hat and a valise
wandering around?

1005
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:31,839
- Yes, l did. With a man and a child.
- A man and a child?

1006
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:35,316
Yes, they were out by the bridge,
toward the circus.

1007
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,715
''Cringing, slimy vermin.''

1008
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:00,032
- Hurry up with that milk. She'll fall asleep.
- l'm coming.

1009
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,596
- Don't overfeed her.
- l'm not gonna overfeed her.

1010
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,473
- OK. Now, this is warm.
- She's so beautiful.

1011
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,755
Look at her eyes. Be careful.

1012
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:13,236
- Her fingers are very tiny.
- l'm careful. l'm very careful.

1013
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:16,989
- Now she's asleep. She won't drink this.
- She smiled at me.

1014
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,680
Did you see that? She smiled.

1015
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,756
- She's the future.
- Yeah.

1016
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,314
- You're the future.
- l want her to go to school.

1017
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,954
l don't want her to be
a travelling gypsy like us.

1018
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,753
l just wanna hold her for a minute.
Can l hold her?

1019
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:32,917
No, you better not.
No, because you squeeze too hard.

1020
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:35,429
l don't squeeze hard. Come on. Please.

1021
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:37,915
- No. Just let's feed her.
- No. l wanna hold her.

1022
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,395
- Listen, no.
- Please.

1023
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,910
We'll have another baby instead.

1024
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,110
- Another baby?
- Yeah.

1025
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:50,676
l don't want her to grow up alone.
lt's not good to grow up alone.

1026
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,076
- She'll be too lonely.
- That's wonderful.

1027
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:45,756
(horse neighs)

1028
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,837
(Kleinman) lrmy, look out!
Look out! lt's the killer!

1029
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,838
- Kleinman!
- Yes, l'm here! Run! Run! Run!

1030
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:02,236
- What about you?
- Don't worry. l'll take care of...

1031
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,432
- Don't come near her. Run! Run!
- What about you?

1032
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:08,199
Don't worry about me.
l can take care of myself.

1033
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,276
Don't come near me.

1034
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,236
(man groans)

1035
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:40,197
Good evening.
l am Almstead the magician.

1036
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:44,277
Almstead! My God!
l do some tricks myself.

1037
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,312
l'm an amateur magician.
You're my idol. l came to see you.

1038
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,238
l was just celebrating
our closing performance.

1039
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:54,876
And also, of course, packing up
my illusions and my paraphernalia.

1040
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,834
The killer's loose.
You have to stop. The killer is loose.

1041
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,520
- The evil one.
- Yes! Yes. Roaming...

1042
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:05,318
There he is!
Think of something! Think quick!

1043
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,834
Come! Come! Over here!

1044
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,349
- Quickly! Come!
- What?

1045
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:14,836
My mirror illusion.
Come! You must help. Come!

1046
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,556
Yes! Come!

1047
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:25,430
Come. Come, young man.
Come. Jump into the mirror.

1048
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,358
Come. The evil one comes.

1049
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,436
Just jump. Jump!

1050
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,475
Jump!

1051
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,756
- (Kleinman) We got him!
- We have captured the beast!

1052
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,474
Yes, we got him. We got him!

1053
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:42,957
- lt's fantastic. He was right...
- Yes, he was here. Now he's there.

1054
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:47,358
- (lrmy) Come on, everybody! He's in here!
- (Kleinman) We got him.

1055
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:51,109
- Where is he?
- He is over there, bound in chains.

1056
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:55,028
- Where is he?
- Over there. Bound hand and foot in ch...

1057
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:58,311
- (man) Where?
- (Kleinman) Where'd he go?

1058
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:01,750
- Where is he? What're you talkin' about?
- He was right here!

1059
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:05,395
- Kleinman saw him. He was here.
- l did. He was right over here.

1060
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,318
No man could have escaped from...

1061
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:11,910
Look! Look, you see.
Here. These are the real locks.

1062
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,156
Almstead, you drink too much.

1063
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,272
- l tell you he was here. We had the killer!
- Search the building.

1064
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:20,358
Looks like he's a better
magician than you.

1065
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:26,071
l'm so tired l can't even think straight.

1066
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,555
l wanna go to sleep, you know.

1067
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,433
We definitely had him.
You believe me. Ask him.

1068
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,551
Even l could not have escaped.

1069
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:40,355
All l know is you certainly saved my life.
You were very brave.

1070
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:43,995
Well, l can be brave.
lt's just that l can't think about it first.

1071
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:49,274
lf l ever think about what's gonna happen
to me, then l lose control of my muscles.

1072
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,879
Well, l guess this is goodbye.

1073
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,639
We're gonna be pulling out in a few hours.

1074
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,069
lt's been a strange night, hasn't it?

1075
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,430
l feel like my whole life has changed.

1076
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:02,994
Me too. Very unusual.

1077
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,712
So are you gonna be OK?

1078
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:10,834
Apart from the fact that l'm wanted by
a lynch mob and the police are after me...

1079
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,669
..and there's a maniac loose and l'm
unemployed, everything else is fine.

1080
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,156
- What are you gonna do?
- Mr Kleinman.

1081
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,714
You know l am looking for an assistant?

1082
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:24,037
- You are?
- You said that you knew all of my tricks.

1083
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:27,470
Yes, l'm an amateur magi...
l'm an amateur. l...

1084
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,832
As a matter of fact l can do a little thing
here that you might appreciate.

1085
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:36,476
l'm not as good at this as l once...
Wait. l'm nervous, cos it's Almstead.

1086
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,956
Well, that is a beginning.
Hey, yes. Of course it is, now.

1087
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,870
At any rate, you know, you assisted
Almstead at a critical time.

1088
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:48,629
l am still bewildered
by his miraculous escape.

1089
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,955
My theory is, we did something
to deserve this.

1090
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:54,152
- That's crazy.
- That's all l hear all night. Theories.

1091
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,508
What's your theory?

1092
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,995
Nothing good's gonna happen
until we catch him.

1093
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,759
So, do you wish to assist
the great Almstead?

1094
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:05,556
Watch this. l would love to, but l can't
just run away and join the circus.

1095
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:09,559
Just what's wrong with the circus?
You travel, you drink.

1096
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,229
- There's beautiful women.
- l can't. l'm gonna join the circus?

1097
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:18,229
That's crazy. l have to go back
to town and join real life.

1098
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,476
- Like what?
- What do you mean, ''like what''?

1099
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,353
You know. What kind of question is that?

1100
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:26,313
l could marry my landlady
and run a boarding house.

1101
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:29,193
Yes, yes, yes. The grey hat.

1102
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:33,438
Sooner or later we all must put on
the grey hat of compromise.

1103
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,312
No, l'm, you know...

1104
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:39,638
Believe me, l'm flattered by your offer,
but at heart l'm a clerk.

1105
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,513
l'm an ink-stained wretch
is what it is in the end.

1106
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,952
So you do not wish to apprentice
with the immortal Almstead, eh? Mm?

1107
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:50,959
Well, they come from all over to see
Almstead, even the crowned heads.

1108
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:56,279
l once produced a rabbit from between
the bosoms of the Queen of Denmark.

1109
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,277
A small rabbit.

1110
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,470
Small bosoms.

1111
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,393
How could l work for the circus? l mean...

1112
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,875
You know. lt's crazy.

1113
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:12,319
Although, l must say, to be
Almstead's assistant would be...

1114
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,278
lt's crazy. lt's just a dream.

1115
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:21,757
Well, l don't know if we're gonna be
passing through this way again.

1116
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,989
- Good luck.
- You take care of yourself.

1117
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,076
- You too.
- Thank you.

1118
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:51,555
lmagine turning down an opportunity to
work with a legend in the show business.

1119
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:55,958
- Your tricks didn't stop the killer.
- But we checked his reins for a moment.

1120
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:59,231
Perhaps we even frightened him.

1121
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:03,399
Look. Look what
he has done to my mirror.

1122
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:08,230
Well, l had better
pack up my paraphernalia.

1123
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:11,909
Almstead. l've decided
to accept your offer.

1124
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:15,316
Congratulations.
Of course, the pay is very low.

1125
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,512
- That's OK. l don't need much money.
- Very, very low.

1126
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:22,713
- l understand, but it's no problem.
- Perhaps lower than you might think.

1127
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:25,434
l don't care. This is
the first time in my life...

1128
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,949
..that l can do something that l really love.

1129
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:33,108
Love? Just make sure that love
does not interfere with your duties!

1130
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,071
No. My duties come first.

1131
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:37,760
What better way to spend
the rest of my life...

1132
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:41,077
..than to help you with all those
wonderful illusions of yours?

1133
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,839
(man) lt's true.
Everybody loves his illusions.

1134
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:46,394
Loves them?

1135
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,476
They need them.

1136
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,955
Like they need the air.

1137
01:21:26,360 --> 01:21:29,318
