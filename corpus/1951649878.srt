1
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:04,322
Oh, I bet you got a Iot of questions
rattIing around in your head.

2
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:07,798
-How much money in the case?
-Anywhere between 350 and haIf a miI.

3
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,529
-And how much do you need, VaI?
-We spIit it 50-50.

4
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,036
-How much?
-130 grand.

5
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:13,696
-We'II hit them on Friday.
-It's not enough.

6
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,832
-And how much do you need, VaI?
-We spIit it 50-50.

7
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,705
-It's my money.
-Yeah, weII, I'm up short.

8
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,301
My 70 grand, I want it back.

9
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,606
-60 short.
-70.

10
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:23,978
70, VaI. It's 70 grand.
70, you dumb bastards.

11
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:49,633
Help the homeless.

12
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,513
Help the homeless.

13
00:01:57,217 --> 00:02:00,243
Oh, that's small change. Why don't
you give me some big change?

14
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,744
Give a guy a break. What do you say?

15
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,084
Come on, now.

16
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:07,850
Oh, thanks, man. Oh...
Hey, what the fuck!

17
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,690
What are you...

18
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,299
Son of a... Motherfucker!

19
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,604
-What do l owe you?
-$2.98.

20
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,155
Son of a... Hey! Hey, my cigarettes!

21
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:20,756
Oh! Sorry, sir. Pardon me.

22
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,664
Thank you.

23
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:06,436
$100, $200, $300.

24
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,212
Have a nice day, Mr. Johnson.

25
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,744
Excellent fit, sir.

26
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,250
And how will you be paying?

27
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,207
Yeah, l'll give you $900 for this.

28
00:04:42,315 --> 00:04:43,907
Let me see that Magnum.

29
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:49,145
That's it.

30
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,138
$500 and the gun.

31
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,789
-l'll need to see some lD.
-Of course.

32
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,635
l'm sorry, Mr. Johnson.
This card's been canceled.

33
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,701
lmpossible.

34
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:44,404
Well, l tried it twice.

35
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,377
-Do you have another form of payment?
-Try it again.

36
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,583
Porter, you're not dead.

37
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:50,696
Where's Val?

38
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,128
Gone. Moved out two months ago.

39
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,968
-Where?
-Don't know.

40
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,667
-Who's paying your rent?
-Val.

41
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,679
-Why?
-Payoff, l guess.

42
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,842
What, you guess? You don't know?

43
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:24,025
Damn it! You've got a fucking lot
of nerve coming around here

44
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:27,537
all fucking high and mighty. What,
you bring your whore with you, did you?

45
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,010
-No, no, no.
-Look at it!

46
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:44,055
Look, see. Look at that.
That's before we met, baby.

47
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,453
Think about it.

48
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,633
Oh, God.

49
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,539
Oh, God.

50
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,316
-So, what are you gonna do, Porter?
-l'm gonna get my money back.

51
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,191
You mean, what am l gonna do to you.

52
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,330
Well, that depends on you.

53
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:32,963
Where's Val?

54
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:36,869
l told you, l don't know.

55
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:43,910
Did he ever buy his way back
into the syndicate?

56
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,144
Yeah.

57
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,380
How do you get your payoffs?

58
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:57,524
A messenger, first of every month,
leaves an envelope with cash in it.

59
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:10,304
So, who was she, anyway?
That girl in the picture.

60
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:14,171
l met her when l got out of prison.

61
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:18,450
l used to drive her,
keep her safe while she worked.

62
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,281
What were you, her pimp?

63
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,953
No, no.

64
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,352
We both worked for that asshole.

65
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,582
Not now.

66
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:32,550
Yeah.

67
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,392
You're cleaning up.

68
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,230
No.

69
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,975
VaI stiII wants to taIk to you.

70
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,672
Sorry, babe.

71
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,207
ShaII I teII him to caII back again?

72
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,510
No, l'll talk to him.

73
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,683
Shut him up, anyway.

74
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,884
Val.

75
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:26,030
Yeah, same as always. You?

76
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:27,864
Yeah, good, good.

77
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,160
Why? You there now?

78
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,875
Well, don't sweat it, Val.
l mean, we all look alike to them.

79
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,177
Same crew. The Chows.

80
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,279
Twice a week, Tuesday and Friday.

81
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,375
Always between 1 1 :00 and 12:00,
always the same route.

82
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:49,281
Chinese money laundering.

83
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:58,326
-How much money in the case?
-Anywhere between 350 and half a mil.

84
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:07,732
-And how much do you need, Val?
-We split it 50-50.

85
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:12,269
No, l mean, how much do you need to,
you know, buy your way back?

86
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,647
lnto the syndicate. How much?

87
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,011
-You mean the outfit?
-Whatever.

88
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,180
Jesus, you know everything.

89
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,090
Hi, sweetie.

90
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,227
130 grand.

91
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:41,168
The beauty of the Chows
is they won't go to the cops.

92
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,573
They keep everything in-house,
and they don't feel pain the way we do.

93
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,013
You notice anything
about those guys, Val?

94
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,478
They look nasty.

95
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,708
Probably all kung fu motherfuckers.

96
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:55,613
-Why? Did l miss something?
-They weren't wearing their seat belts.

97
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,884
We'll hit them on Friday.

98
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,537
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

99
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,020
Looky here.

100
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,465
How's that vinyl taste?

101
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:30,872
Val!

102
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:32,584
What?

103
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:49,960
The problem with kicking
the Chows' asses,

104
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,333
an hour later you wanna do it again.

105
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:55,397
Huh?

106
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:11,152
1 40 grand.

107
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,088
1 40 apiece.

108
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:15,452
Total.

109
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,257
Total?

110
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,232
That's... That's what? That's 70 grand?

111
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,399
-That's not enough.
-lt is for me.

112
00:18:26,505 --> 00:18:29,133
l'm taking the next few months off.
Here's the bag, baby.

113
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,833
Yeah, well, l'm up short.

114
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,106
60 short. Fucking slants!

115
00:18:34,246 --> 00:18:37,044
Should've hit them Tuesday. Fuck!

116
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:42,910
We got away clean
and got something to show for it.

117
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:47,390
Always be grateful for what you get.
Rule number one, Val.

118
00:18:48,894 --> 00:18:49,986
Yeah.

119
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:52,560
Yeah. Rule number one.

120
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:04,400
What?

121
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,943
Everything's cool.

122
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,551
lt's just not enough, all right?

123
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,321
lt never is, Val.

124
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:22,257
Hey, baby, just put the money
in the car, will you?

125
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,970
l can't fucking believe it. We should...

126
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:35,835
You know... You know what?
You know what, Porter?

127
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,369
This is funny. This'll kill you.

128
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:44,910
lt's always $1 40,000.

129
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,384
Someone ought to give me a PhD.

130
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,251
You...

131
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:57,990
Shit!

132
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,662
Jesus, Lynn,
wait till l'm out of the fucking way!

133
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:14,975
Okay, everything's cool, baby.

134
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,947
Oh! Oh!

135
00:20:24,489 --> 00:20:26,480
You were great. You were great.

136
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,719
Everything's cool. Give me the... Okay.

137
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,522
Okay, okay, keep the gun.

138
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,927
That's it. Everything's cool.

139
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,429
Just like we planned. Come on.

140
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,435
Don't fall apart on me now.

141
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,105
There we go.

142
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:56,276
Oh, l bet you got a lot of questions
rattling around in your head.

143
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,422
l don't know, pally.

144
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:07,089
l guess wives get funny
when it comes to girlfriends, huh?

145
00:21:10,068 --> 00:21:11,126
What?

146
00:21:12,704 --> 00:21:14,069
l didn't get that.

147
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,005
You got it.

148
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,236
Come on, Miss Porter,
l don't have all day!

149
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,432
ls... ls Miss Porter here?

150
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:20,966
Mrs. Porter.

151
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,105
Yeah, whatever.

152
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,582
You motherfucker!

153
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,387
Get up, turn around.

154
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,419
Come on. Get up. Come on.

155
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:45,995
What have we got here, huh?

156
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:51,026
-How much in here, huh?
-There's two grand.

157
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,398
What's in here?

158
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:55,029
Helium. What the fuck you think it is?
lt's heroin.

159
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,300
Oh, fuck!

160
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:06,008
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

161
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,576
Fuck!

162
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,952
Val Resnick.

163
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,823
Where is he?

164
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,523
You wanna know where he is?

165
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:20,188
He's right here. Look. Look. Fuck you.

166
00:23:20,298 --> 00:23:21,788
Wrong answer.

167
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:25,768
Shit! You motherfucker!

168
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,636
-Fuck!
-Val Resnick.

00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,608
l never heard of him, man. Fuck.

170
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,145
Where'd you get the envelope
and the shit?

171
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,408
Come on, man,
they're gonna fucking kill me.

172
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,279
They're gonna kill me, man.

173
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,223
What do you think l'm gonna do?

174
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,652
Worry about me.

175
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,293
Oh, come on. Okay.

176
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:51,089
Okay, okay, okay.

177
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:54,694
Stegman... Stegman, man.
Arthur fucking Stegman. Okay?

178
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,465
Where is he?

179
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,661
Southend Taxi.

180
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,272
Farragut Road, man.

181
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,371
Thanks.

182
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,504
You're welcome.

183
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,907
l'm looking for Arthur Stegman.

184
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,699
He ain't here.
Something l can help you with?

185
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,810
No, you can't. Where is he?

186
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:44,578
l don't know. He ain't here.

187
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:48,012
Take a guess.

188
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:50,112
What?

189
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,492
Take a guess about where he is.

190
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,931
ls he at home?

191
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,143
Why don't you go fuck yourself?

192
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,611
All right, here we go.

193
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,239
Hey, come on, roll it!

194
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,650
-Wait a minute. That was mine!
-lt was not yours, man.

195
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:24,118
l get one more shot.

196
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,385
There's somebody here to see you.

197
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,460
l'm looking for Stegman.

198
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,929
Who the hell are you?

199
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:44,633
l'm Porter.

200
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,473
Well, Porter,
that looks like assault to me.

201
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:55,583
Porter looks to me like the kind
that likes to resist arrest.

202
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,748
-Hey!
-Whoa!

203
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:00,984
Fuck, no! Not in here.

204
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,356
Jesus, guys, he just... He wants to talk.

205
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:06,089
Am l right? Did l call it?

206
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,626
Are you Stegman?

207
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,706
Maybe. What do you want?

208
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,502
Your boy didn't make his delivery.

209
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:21,834
Jesus.

210
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,847
Whoa, Artie.

211
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,543
Hey, listen, don't worry about it.
Why don't we talk outside?

212
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:28,243
Artie, you're a dealer?

213
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:31,185
Just forget about it, all right?

214
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,886
And don't touch my money, either.

215
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,152
-Come on. Let's...
-This is heroin?

216
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:40,924
-This is heroin.
-Guys, just...

217
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:44,934
Don't worry about it, all right?
Just take it easy. Let's talk. Come on.

218
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:48,829
What are you guys looking at?
Play your game.

219
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:52,840
And you're bleeding all over my couch.
Come on, you. Come on.

220
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,976
Steggie's been holding out on us.

221
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,853
l'll check it out.

222
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,282
Val Resnick.

223
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,188
-What about him?
-You're gonna tell me where he is.

224
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:14,288
No. No. Even if l knew,
the answer would still be no.

225
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:16,629
Now, where'd you meet up
with my delivery boy?

226
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:17,759
At his drop.

227
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:18,961
ls he dead?

228
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:22,267
No, but she is. OD'd on that crap
you've been sending her.

229
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,063
So?

230
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,000
-What do you care?
-l'm her husband.

231
00:27:29,014 --> 00:27:31,448
You're not gonna fucking kill me,
are you?

232
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,115
Not in front of these kids.

233
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,488
Where is he?

234
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,394
l don't know.

235
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:46,721
That's the truth.

236
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,493
You see, this stuff gets delivered to me,
too, you know. Last night.

237
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,126
And l won't see anyone again
till next month.

238
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,472
Why all the trouble?

239
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,869
Well, he's afraid of the girl.

240
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:01,742
You know, l mean, of... Of Mrs. Porter.

241
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,807
Look, l don't know nothing
about this, okay?

242
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,716
l know Val from the old days.

243
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,756
Three months ago he shows up,
asks me to do him a favor.

244
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:16,190
l make an extra grand a month,
so l figure, what the hell, right?

245
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:18,228
Now you come around
threatening to kill me?

246
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:21,059
Believe me,
that much a buddy of Val's, l am not.

247
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,491
He's in the city. That's it.
That's all l know.

248
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:26,570
-l got a game going on in here.
-How do you know that?

249
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:27,895
He said so.

250
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:30,065
-When?
-When he... Then.

251
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,164
When he came around.

252
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,369
Said that he squared himself
with the syndicate.

253
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:35,241
Said he was back in the big time.

254
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,746
Back for good. He was very excited.

255
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:40,647
Well, you tell him
that Porter is back, too,

256
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,716
and he wants his money,
Porter wants his money.

257
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,289
Or l'll come back here
and pay you a visit

258
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,756
-when these kids are not around.
-Well...

259
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,052
When would l tell him this?

260
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:15,316
Talk to me.

261
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:19,045
There's a young Iady to see you, sir.
Her name is PearI.

262
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:21,451
She's got two very bad habits.

263
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,528
Right now,
l'm only interested in one of them.

264
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:26,661
Send her up.

265
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,927
Apartment 7 18, ma'am. Go right on up.

266
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:55,554
-Send her up. What's the problem?
-Hey, VaI, it's HaskeII.

267
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,423
Sorry to be caIIing you at home,
but I thought...

268
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,793
Don't be sorry, sweetie. Just don't call.

269
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,627
WeII, I thought it might be important.

270
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:04,167
I got a caII from a cab guy
out in the south end.

271
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:06,396
-What is it?
-WeII, it's this guy, Stegman.

272
00:30:06,504 --> 00:30:08,369
Shit. Hold on a second.

273
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,246
On your knees, bitch.
l want satisfaction.

274
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,181
l'm on the phone, Pearl.

275
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,719
That's Mistress Pearl,
you piece of dog shit.

276
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,989
l'm on the fucking phone!

277
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:38,229
Make it quick, huh?

278
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:41,669
So, anyhow, this guy Stegman caIIed.
He sounded aII nervous.

279
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:45,067
Sounded Iike something
scared the shit out of him.

280
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,703
He said he had to taIk to you.
I said I'd see what I couId do, VaI.

281
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,448
Yeah? Did he tell you
what it was about?

282
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:53,710
He said to teII you Lynn was dead.

283
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:56,878
He said some guy came around
taIking mean and wanted you.

284
00:30:56,988 --> 00:31:00,219
And that's aII he said.
I thought you ought to know.

285
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:03,726
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you did right.
l wanna talk to that son of a bitch.

286
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:05,261
Who, Stegman?

287
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,197
No, President Nixon.
Of course Stegman.

288
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,067
Tell him Varrick's by the bridge.

289
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,567
Make it...

290
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,507
Make it 20 minutes, huh?

291
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,348
-Steggie.
-Hey, Val.

292
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,617
You know, l tried to call you,

293
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,125
but you must have changed your
number again. 'Cause l got nothing.

294
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,822
l never gave you
my original number, Steg.

295
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,457
What did this guy look like?

296
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,798
Well, he had, like, dark hair, blue eyes.

297
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,600
He was like
a real Cro-Magnon-looking bastard.

298
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,266
Well, if Lynn's dead,
maybe he did us a favor, huh?

299
00:31:51,376 --> 00:31:54,311
l know what you mean, except
l'm out like a grand a month, you know?

300
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,710
Well, maybe we can
work something out.

301
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:59,043
Did you get a name?

302
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,810
He said his name was Porter.

303
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:04,514
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

304
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:09,419
-He said he was there for Porter?
-No. No, he said he was Porter.

305
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,067
Yeah. l'll tell you something.

306
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,294
l wouldn't want that guy after me, either.
l know how you must feel.

307
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:22,703
What am l, a nobody?

308
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:25,000
-No.
-l've got friends.

309
00:32:25,476 --> 00:32:27,103
All l have to do is point.

310
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:29,975
l pick up a phone, say his name,
and he's a dead man.

311
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:31,912
And this time he stays dead!

312
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:34,849
All right, Val, try to keep it down.
All right?

313
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,250
lt's okay.

314
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,723
-What did he say about me?
-He just... Nothing.

315
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:43,351
-He just said you owed him money.
-Not why? Nothing else?

316
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:44,688
Nothing.

317
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:48,328
-Why? How much you owe him?
-None of your goddamn business.

318
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,225
Well, l just, you know...

319
00:32:50,335 --> 00:32:52,997
l got the feeling
he'd like to kill you, that's all.

320
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,435
Oh, Christ.

321
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:56,766
Porter.

322
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,338
What?

323
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,779
What did you tell him?

324
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,147
Nothing. What could l tell him?

325
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,810
You tell him about the money?
The heroin?

326
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:12,617
He had it with him.

327
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:14,123
l just... l told him l delivered it.

328
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:17,558
-You didn't tell him nothing else?
-l don't know nothing else.

329
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,223
Nah. You gave him something.

330
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,927
A name, maybe.
Someone who knows where to find me.

331
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:26,470
-l swear, Val, on my mother...
-Hey, fuck your mother!

332
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,436
Hey, that's not nice.
Now, why don't you try to take it easy?

333
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,168
-What the fuck you looking at?
-Take it easy.

334
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,301
Val, don't. Come on. Not again.
Don't do that.

335
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:37,404
-What the fuck you looking at?
-No, Val, no. Come on. Not again.

336
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,143
-What the fuck are you looking at?
-Val, come on, don't. Not again.

337
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:42,344
-Come on, just forget it.
-ls there some trouble here?

338
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,921
No, you know what? We're...
We're just... We're leaving.

339
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,251
We're leaving.

340
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,292
You know what, Val?
This one's on me, okay?

341
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:51,055
You see me reaching
for my fucking wallet?

342
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:52,151
No.

343
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:00,064
-Hey, pal, is there a Michael here?
-That's him over yonder.

344
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,901
Michael.

345
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:07,869
l'm told you're the man to see
about expensive horizontal refreshment.

346
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,106
l'm looking for a girl named Rosie.

347
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:14,683
Prostitution is illegal,
and you're speaking Greek.

348
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:21,883
Usually these matters are conducted
with more discretion.

349
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:28,155
Be discreet now.

350
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,571
-What was her name again?
-Rosie.

351
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,197
And who should l say is looking for her?

352
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,775
Just call her.

353
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:49,611
-Rosie?
-Yeah.

354
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,347
Give me the phone.

355
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,248
Here.

356
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,656
Take care of that.

357
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:59,055
-Rosie.
-Who the heII is this?

358
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,692
-Porter.
-Try again, honey. Porter's dead.

359
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:07,702
l used to drive for you,
provide a safe work environment.

360
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:09,833
Porter?

361
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:11,931
Yeah.

362
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:52,706
Hi.

363
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:58,915
Come on. Come in.

364
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:02,915
You look pretty good for a dead guy.

365
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,697
-How'd you hear about it?
-People who know were talking.

366
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:16,263
Plus, l heard
your wife was back in town alone.

367
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,173
She's dead.

368
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,238
l'm sorry, Porter.

369
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:24,738
Why?

370
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,677
Jesus. Surly Porter.
You're the same as ever, aren't you?

371
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,284
This doesn't look like you.

372
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,653
Yeah, well, people change.

373
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,031
Stay. lt's okay, baby. lt's okay.

374
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,635
Come on, sweetheart. lt's okay.

375
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,834
Meet the nastiest damn dog
who ever lived.

376
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,477
-What's his name?
-Porter.

377
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,439
He took your job after you left.

378
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,711
He's just as tough,
but he won't leave me, will you, baby?

379
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,184
l need a favor.

380
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,357
A favor?

381
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:16,565
Maybe you're not the same as ever.

382
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,035
l'm looking for a syndicate boy.

383
00:37:23,641 --> 00:37:25,802
lt's the outfit, baby.
We don't say syndicate anymore.

384
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,344
Well, you know what l mean.
Whatever the hell you call it.

385
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,937
Don't get touchy, Porter.
What's his name?

386
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,281
Val Resnick.

387
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,654
Oh, that son of a bitch.

388
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:40,947
-You know him?
-Yeah.

389
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:44,788
l met up with him once a few years ago.

390
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:48,261
He can't use Star Service anymore
because he beats up all the girls.

391
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,163
He almost killed one.

392
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:52,393
You?

393
00:37:56,674 --> 00:37:59,939
Does it matter?
You quit looking after me, remember?

394
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:05,816
Would you happen to have a line
on where he might be?

395
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:06,180
Would you happen to have a line
on where he might be?

396
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,753
-l suppose he's at the hotel.
-Which one?

397
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:14,017
The outfit hotel. They're all there.

398
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:17,021
You got an address?

399
00:38:18,896 --> 00:38:20,659
We're friends, right?

400
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,396
l mean, we used to be.

401
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,393
But l'm an employee, too,

402
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,403
and l don't think
the outfit would like me telling you

403
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,836
where the hotel was, would they?

404
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:31,601
-No. What do you think l'm gonna do?
-How strong are you, Porter?

405
00:38:31,709 --> 00:38:35,509
Personally, l think you are
the strongest man l have ever met.

406
00:38:35,913 --> 00:38:38,006
But l wonder if it's enough.

407
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,710
For what?

408
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:44,348
lf l know you, you want this Resnick guy
for something he won't like.

409
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,218
Yeah, l'm gonna kill him.

410
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,324
That's something he won't like.

411
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:55,462
What if something goes wrong,
and they grab you

412
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,727
and they ask you
where you found out about the hotel?

413
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,463
Why are we even talking about this?
You know l wouldn't turn you in.

414
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,368
l wouldn't talk about who told me what.

415
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,668
But what if they ask you hard?

416
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:08,976
l'll tell them it was a cab dispatcher
named Stegman.

417
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:15,783
The Oakwood Arms, Union and 1 7th.

418
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,731
All this time, you don't even pretend
to ask how l've been.

419
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,193
You need any cash or anything?

420
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:41,208
Get yourself killed, prick.
l ought to tell him you're coming.

421
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:19,643
Hi, Val.

422
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,711
Where's my money?

423
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:32,925
No, it's not there. l took your gun.
lt's back here.

424
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:34,464
You look like a pro.

425
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:37,534
You keep your mouth shut,
and you'll walk out of here.

426
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:43,003
My 70 grand, l want it.

427
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,034
l don't have it right now.

428
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:48,870
Where is it?

429
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:53,643
l gave all $130,000 to the outfit.
l gave it all to them.

430
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:58,719
Well, tell them you gave them
money that doesn't belong to you,

431
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,482
and get it back.

432
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:05,026
Now, Porter, l can't do that.
l mean, you don't know these...

433
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,729
You're gonna kill me
whether l get the money or not.

434
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,698
All right, l'll get it. l'll get it.
l'll get the money.

435
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,293
Just give me a few days, all right?

436
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:16,498
What the fuck are you doing?

437
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:20,309
Noon. Tomorrow. Say it.

438
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:22,004
All right.

439
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:26,139
You know, this may sound crazy, Porter,
but no hard feelings, huh?

440
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,880
l did what l had to do.
You could appreciate that.

441
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,883
Yeah, l appreciate that,
you son of a bitch.

442
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,616
No, no, no. Don't.

443
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:37,289
Please. Allow me.

444
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,762
Jesus. God.

445
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:54,902
God.

446
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:57,512
You bitch!

447
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,617
Let her work.

448
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:16,893
Me love you, baby.

449
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,996
Me love you long time.

450
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,306
Wait up, hon. Wait.

451
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,577
Tomorrow. Noon.

452
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:42,591
You and the money, be at the corner
of 7th and Franklin at the pay phone.

453
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,189
Okay. Okay.

454
00:42:48,332 --> 00:42:50,095
Where'd you get this?

455
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,334
Some hooker had it on her shelf.

456
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,436
l recognized you.
l swiped it in case l could use it.

457
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,133
Did you hurt her?

458
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,305
The hooker, did you hurt her?

459
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,075
What does that have to do
with anything?

460
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,257
l've got a few minutes.

461
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,087
So go boil an egg.

462
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,765
Can l help you?

463
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,976
Val Resnick.
l got an appointment with Mr. Carter.

464
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:41,475
Yes.

465
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,679
Turn around, please.

466
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,278
Listen, sweetie,
you don't have to do that.

467
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:47,789
Turn around.

468
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,959
Thank you.

469
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,197
-Very nice.
-You like that?

470
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:11,109
-lt's down there.
-Yes.

471
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,375
This isn't how
Mr. Carter likes his visitors.

472
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,680
l know.

473
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:19,784
lt's just l'm in a little bit of trouble
right now.

474
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,188
Yes, Mr. Carter thinks so, too.

475
00:44:23,594 --> 00:44:25,221
This way, please.

476
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:29,559
Philip tells me you have a problem
you need help with.

477
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:31,362
Yes, sir.

478
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:36,136
ls it your problem who breached
our security last night at the Oakwood?

479
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,468
Yes, sir.

480
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,504
Then he breaks into my apartment...

481
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:42,135
There's three ways
that we can handle this.

482
00:44:42,246 --> 00:44:44,407
One, we can help you.

483
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,717
Two, we can allow you to help yourself.

484
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:50,343
And three, we can have you replaced.

485
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,885
We have an investment in you, Resnick.

486
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:59,361
So assisting you would be,
in a way, protecting our investment.

487
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:03,393
And that is always
good business policy.

488
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:08,198
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, Mr. Carter.
Thank you, sir. You won't regret it.

489
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:09,896
Now,

490
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:15,769
according to Philip,
a man has come to town to kill you?

491
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:16,937
Yes, sir.

492
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,982
And you say that he's alone
and that he's a professional robber.

493
00:45:20,084 --> 00:45:21,108
ls that correct?

494
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:25,177
Yes, sir. He does payroll jobs, banks,
you know, stuff like that.

495
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:27,447
-What's his name?
-Porter.

496
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:30,952
Well, what's his first name?

497
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:35,957
You know, l don't know it.

498
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,193
He never called himself
anything but Porter.

499
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:53,346
Where did you get the $130,000?

500
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,651
That's why
this man has come to town, huh?

501
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:02,615
The $130,000 that you paid us back?

502
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:05,687
Yes, sir, but only $70,000 of it was his.

503
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:08,287
Well, we never asked you
where you got the money.

504
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,059
lt was none of our business.

505
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:13,227
But now it appears
it has become our business.

506
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,133
Here's his file, Mr. Carter.

507
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,679
Do you understand your value
to the organization, Resnick?

508
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:36,420
You're a sadist. You lack compunction.
That comes in handy.

509
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,996
But now you've allowed an area
of your personal life

510
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:42,065
to become a danger to us.

511
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:48,100
A man in our organization
needs to be tough and self-reliant.

512
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,607
Were you to handle this problem
on your own,

513
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:56,645
there would be no doubt

514
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,507
that you're the kind of man we want.

515
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:01,914
l want to.

516
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:05,280
-l want to handle it myself, Mr. Carter.
-Great.

517
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:07,683
Until the matter is handled,

518
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:10,589
l want you to move out
of the Oakwood Arms.

519
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,161
But l don't have a place...

520
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:18,393
l don't want any more unpleasantness
at the hotel.

521
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:21,932
Yes, sir.

522
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,070
That's it. Val's in the doghouse, Spider.

523
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,972
l'll fill you in on the way.

524
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,144
He loves me. Let's go.

525
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,844
He doesn't love you, Val.

526
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,675
Sorry. We've been reassigned.

527
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:40,651
Go ahead.

528
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:44,791
After last night, l'm safer without you.
Look at me. Look at this.

529
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,829
What the fuck good are you, huh?

530
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,522
Get out of here.

531
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,528
Never forget a pussy's face,
you remember that.

532
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,532
l'll do it myself.

533
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:01,403
Do it myself. You want it done right!

534
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:04,045
You got to do it yourself!

535
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:07,913
lt's the American way!

536
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:17,821
-Yes?
-Did your friends make it to town?

537
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,756
Oh, yeah. Last night, baby.

538
00:48:21,198 --> 00:48:24,258
Good. Now, did you teII them
it was Porter took that payroII?

539
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:28,031
l did. And they want retribution.

540
00:48:28,805 --> 00:48:31,137
All right. All right. Here's what we do.

541
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,398
Oh, shit.

542
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:58,319
Shit.

543
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,465
Next time, Porter.

544
00:50:08,605 --> 00:50:11,039
Looks like Porter's
made some new friends.

545
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:32,584
-Easy, mister.
-l'm okay. l don't want to press charges.

546
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,823
-Who were they, pal?
-l don't know. l don't know.

547
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:37,866
All right. l don't wanna...
Oh, it's you guys.

548
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:40,869
Our buddy Stegman says you got a line
on a load of cash there, Porter.

549
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,871
250 grand, to be exact.

550
00:50:44,141 --> 00:50:45,130
70.

551
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:49,638
-Come on, man. Get off of me.
-All right, all right, all right.

552
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:52,306
What do you take us for, huh? ldiots?

553
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,144
Nobody'd go through all this shit
for 70 grand.

554
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:56,583
We don't like trouble, buddy.

555
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,483
You look like a whole bunch of trouble
to us.

556
00:50:58,588 --> 00:51:00,818
We found a dead girl full of heroin.

557
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:02,323
There were signs of a struggle,

558
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,587
and the coroner's not so sure
it was an OD.

559
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:06,457
We got a witness, though.

560
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,428
A guy with only one nostril.
Remember him?

561
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:09,521
Yeah.

562
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:12,534
Hey, don't worry, Porter.
We're gonna give you immunity.

563
00:51:12,636 --> 00:51:14,934
Room to operate,
''Get Out of Jail Free'' card.

564
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:17,506
All you got to do is get the money.

565
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:19,902
Oh, we can't help you, though.

566
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:23,871
-lt'd be against the law.
-You understand, Porter?

567
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:26,678
-lt's my money.
-Wrong, Porter.

568
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:27,942
Fuck!

569
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,752
lt's our money, Porter.
Me and my partner's money.

570
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:33,914
You be a good boy,
we'll give you a piece.

571
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:35,423
lt will be easy, Porter.

572
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:37,657
You got it?

573
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:40,258
-Yeah, he's got it.
-You understand?

574
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:42,888
You take it easy, huh? We'll be in touch.

575
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,432
Sure, thanks.

576
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,230
Fuck.

577
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:32,309
Jesus Christ, Porter,
you need to see a doctor.

578
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:33,473
Yeah.

579
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:37,349
-lt's gonna sting.
-Just clean it up, all right?

580
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,480
-You hold it there.
-Yeah, right.

581
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,367
l'll do it.

582
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,201
Tell me something, Porter.

583
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:08,641
When did you decide to leave?
Was it that night we slept together?

584
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,109
No.

585
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:16,822
lt was the next day
when l had to drive you to work.

586
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:24,029
You could have asked me to quit.

587
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,470
You could have asked me to drive you
somewhere else.

588
00:53:45,468 --> 00:53:47,197
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

589
00:53:55,578 --> 00:53:56,738
Thanks.

590
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,910
-Does it fit?
-Oh, yeah.

591
00:54:00,783 --> 00:54:02,717
Like it was made for me.

592
00:54:03,953 --> 00:54:06,251
lt'll look great in your casket.

593
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,031
You know what l think?

594
00:54:19,469 --> 00:54:23,872
l think that all those stories
about you being dead were true.

595
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:26,771
You're just too thick-headed to admit it.

596
00:54:54,971 --> 00:54:57,269
Porter. God, l missed you.

597
00:54:58,074 --> 00:54:59,541
l missed you.

598
00:55:08,184 --> 00:55:10,516
-Don't talk. Don't.
-Oh, no, l...

599
00:55:11,554 --> 00:55:13,419
l can't. l got...

600
00:55:15,892 --> 00:55:17,689
Stuff to do. l got...

601
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:02,631
Porter.

602
00:56:09,912 --> 00:56:11,277
Where is he?

603
00:56:15,151 --> 00:56:16,880
Porter. Where is he?

604
00:56:17,687 --> 00:56:19,416
He's in the bedroom.

605
00:56:35,004 --> 00:56:36,494
ls he hurt bad?

606
00:56:38,341 --> 00:56:40,901
The doctor should be here any minute.

607
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:42,973
No. That's bullshit.

608
00:56:57,627 --> 00:57:00,619
Porter, here l come, pally.

609
00:57:01,064 --> 00:57:02,224
Porter!

610
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:07,536
Goddamn!

611
00:57:13,242 --> 00:57:14,675
Get in there!

612
00:57:21,217 --> 00:57:23,185
-Where is he?
-He's gone!

613
00:57:23,352 --> 00:57:25,149
He's gone. He's gone.

614
00:57:25,254 --> 00:57:26,551
Gone, huh?

615
00:57:30,426 --> 00:57:33,452
l know you.
You're that whore from the picture.

616
00:57:35,932 --> 00:57:36,990
Yeah.

617
00:57:37,166 --> 00:57:38,929
How do you know him?

618
00:57:39,268 --> 00:57:41,031
He used to drive me.

619
00:57:41,804 --> 00:57:42,930
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

620
00:57:45,742 --> 00:57:48,108
l'm driving you now, honey.

621
00:57:49,545 --> 00:57:51,979
-You know what you are?
-Educate me.

622
00:57:52,081 --> 00:57:53,173
Okay.

623
00:57:53,282 --> 00:57:57,013
An ugly pig who beats up women
on account he can't get it up

624
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:59,850
'cause he's too terrified
of his own fucking shadow!

625
00:57:59,956 --> 00:58:01,150
-ls that right?
-Yep!

626
00:58:01,257 --> 00:58:02,519
-ls that right?
-Yeah.

627
00:58:02,625 --> 00:58:04,786
Then l guess you must be the lucky girl.

628
00:58:07,663 --> 00:58:10,826
Sweetie, l am gonna fuck you
six ways from Sunday.

629
00:58:30,119 --> 00:58:31,279
Jesus.

630
00:58:34,624 --> 00:58:36,319
Forgot my cigarettes.

631
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:42,890
Shit.

632
00:58:46,969 --> 00:58:48,402
All right, Val.

633
00:58:49,272 --> 00:58:52,264
This syndicate, or outfit
or whatever the hell you call it,

634
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:53,808
it's got a head man, right?

635
00:58:54,644 --> 00:58:55,975
Who is it?

636
00:58:56,379 --> 00:58:58,040
They'll kill me, Porter.

637
00:58:58,147 --> 00:59:00,445
What do you think l'm gonna do to you?
Worry about me.

638
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:01,915
Goddamn!

639
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:04,609
Names. Come on.

640
00:59:05,655 --> 00:59:07,088
Fairfax and Carter.

641
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:09,215
Fairfax and Carter.
They run the whole city.

642
00:59:09,325 --> 00:59:10,724
Fairfax and Carter.

643
00:59:10,827 --> 00:59:12,124
Where do l find them?

644
00:59:13,029 --> 00:59:14,929
Fairfax isn't in town right now.

645
00:59:15,598 --> 00:59:18,158
What about Carter? Where is he?
ls he in town?

646
00:59:19,669 --> 00:59:22,069
Porter, it won't do you any good.

647
00:59:22,171 --> 00:59:24,605
They're gonna... Jesus! You...

648
00:59:26,542 --> 00:59:30,808
Frederick Carter lnvestments.
120 Commerce Avenue.

649
00:59:32,648 --> 00:59:34,582
Hey, thanks. There they are.

650
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:39,311
All right. All right!

651
00:59:40,489 --> 00:59:42,047
l'll help you out.

652
00:59:42,892 --> 00:59:46,953
You're fucking nuts going up
against the outfit for 70 grand,

653
00:59:47,063 --> 00:59:49,258
-but l'm gonna help you out.
-Yeah?

654
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:51,691
Here. Keep talking.

655
00:59:54,337 --> 00:59:56,032
Thanks. l...

656
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:00,971
l can get you in there.
Place is tighter than a drum.

657
01:00:01,077 --> 01:00:03,443
-How many guys in there?
-But, well...

658
01:00:03,546 --> 01:00:05,104
lt's tighter than hell.

659
01:00:05,214 --> 01:00:07,182
They got only one guy
on the outside, though,

660
01:00:07,283 --> 01:00:09,114
so l got a way around...

661
01:00:12,622 --> 01:00:16,752
You are crazy.
You are a crazy son of a bitch.

662
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:18,956
-That's why l love you.
-Yep.

663
01:00:19,629 --> 01:00:22,496
-You got a light?
-l... What?

664
01:00:22,899 --> 01:00:24,196
You got a light?

665
01:00:26,535 --> 01:00:28,298
No. No.

666
01:00:28,938 --> 01:00:31,133
-Well, then what good are you?
-Wait!

667
01:00:54,764 --> 01:00:55,890
Rosie.

668
01:00:56,966 --> 01:00:58,058
Rosie.

669
01:01:00,102 --> 01:01:02,036
ls your name on the lease here?

670
01:01:06,676 --> 01:01:09,167
The outfit.
The outfit pays for everything.

671
01:01:10,813 --> 01:01:13,782
l want you to gather everything up
that you need,

672
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:15,881
say goodbye to this place.

673
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:17,811
Okay?

674
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:54,921
-l told you he'd show up.
-Give me my goddamn money, please.

675
01:01:55,024 --> 01:01:56,651
Yeah, give me my money, too.

676
01:01:57,059 --> 01:01:59,994
Give me my goddamn money, please.

677
01:02:00,096 --> 01:02:02,155
-Sure that's him?
-Yeah, that's him, come on.

678
01:02:03,499 --> 01:02:04,761
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

679
01:02:04,867 --> 01:02:06,767
Yeah, there you go.

680
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:10,498
-What you up to, buddy?
-Well, our money's in there

681
01:02:12,041 --> 01:02:13,201
if you're still interested.

682
01:02:13,309 --> 01:02:17,177
Well, not in the dough
but the boat l'm gonna buy with it.

683
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:24,814
-What's he doing here?
-lt's a ride-along, Porter.

684
01:02:25,087 --> 01:02:28,022
You see, your piece of the pie
just got a little smaller.

685
01:02:28,124 --> 01:02:30,558
But don't worry,
l'll leave you some crust.

686
01:02:32,895 --> 01:02:36,922
What are you waiting for, Porter?
Go get it. Go get our money.

687
01:02:39,301 --> 01:02:42,498
-You guys do me a favor?
-We're here to help, buddy.

688
01:02:43,372 --> 01:02:45,363
Well, they're probably gonna frisk me
when l go in there,

689
01:02:45,474 --> 01:02:47,965
so l wonder if you wouldn't mind
holding on to this.

690
01:02:48,077 --> 01:02:49,203
Jesus.

691
01:02:49,912 --> 01:02:51,903
You know, just for a little while.

692
01:02:53,282 --> 01:02:54,442
Sure, Porter.

693
01:02:57,653 --> 01:02:59,917
Hey, nice balance.

694
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:04,617
Douche bag.

695
01:03:14,003 --> 01:03:15,231
Can l help you?

696
01:03:16,072 --> 01:03:18,836
-Yeah, l want to see Mr. Carter.
-And who are you?

697
01:03:19,675 --> 01:03:22,235
Tell him l'm the guy
that whacked Val Resnick.

698
01:03:22,545 --> 01:03:23,739
l'm sorry, l don't...

699
01:03:25,548 --> 01:03:27,140
Didn't copy. Repeat.

700
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:32,513
Right.

701
01:03:34,023 --> 01:03:37,390
Mr. Carter will see you.
Turn around so l can frisk you.

702
01:03:41,864 --> 01:03:43,593
So you popped old Val, huh?

703
01:03:45,668 --> 01:03:47,693
Thanks. Left pocket.

704
01:03:52,241 --> 01:03:54,709
-Saving up?
-Yeah, every little bit helps.

705
01:03:56,011 --> 01:03:57,069
Follow me.

706
01:04:18,868 --> 01:04:20,529
Bravo. Sit down.

707
01:04:26,942 --> 01:04:29,035
My compliments.
They were two of my best.

708
01:04:29,145 --> 01:04:31,204
No, they lull too easy.

709
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:39,282
48.

710
01:04:44,393 --> 01:04:46,088
There's something you want from me.

711
01:04:46,195 --> 01:04:49,426
Val Resnick gave you $130,000.

712
01:04:49,532 --> 01:04:51,090
Paid us. lt was a debt.

713
01:04:52,401 --> 01:04:55,302
Well, $70,000 of it was mine,
and l want it back.

714
01:04:56,872 --> 01:05:00,467
l'm sorry. Resnick told me, but
l seem to have misplaced your name.

715
01:05:00,576 --> 01:05:02,771
-Porter.
-Porter. Right.

716
01:05:03,279 --> 01:05:04,940
l won't forget it again.

717
01:05:06,148 --> 01:05:08,446
The outfit is not unreasonable, Porter,

718
01:05:09,518 --> 01:05:13,113
but no corporation in the world
would agree to what you're asking.

719
01:05:13,222 --> 01:05:15,850
What about Fairfax?
Will he give me my money?

720
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:19,192
Resnick told you quite a bit, didn't he?

721
01:05:19,295 --> 01:05:21,229
Fairfax will tell you
the same thing l have.

722
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:23,628
We're not authorized
to do things like this.

723
01:05:23,732 --> 01:05:26,724
-Who is? Who makes the decisions?
-Well, a committee would make

724
01:05:26,835 --> 01:05:29,395
-a decision in this case.
-No, no. One man.

725
01:05:29,505 --> 01:05:32,030
You go high enough,
you always come to one man. Who?

726
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:46,620
Yeah, Fred Carter.
l wanna talk to Bronson.

727
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:55,296
Yeah, sorry to bother you,
but l have a problem.

728
01:05:55,764 --> 01:05:58,289
There's a man in my office with a gun
who says he's gonna kill me

729
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,062
if the outfit doesn't pay him $130,000...

730
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:05,129
$70,000. lt's 70... Let me talk to him.

731
01:06:07,243 --> 01:06:08,232
Her.

732
01:06:12,982 --> 01:06:14,643
He wants to speak to you.

733
01:06:18,287 --> 01:06:19,379
The speaker.

734
01:06:26,362 --> 01:06:27,761
This is Bronson.

735
01:06:27,863 --> 01:06:30,457
How much is this guy Carter
worth to you?

736
01:06:30,566 --> 01:06:32,864
Worth? What do you mean?

737
01:06:32,968 --> 01:06:35,368
Well, either l get my money,
or l'll kill Carter.

738
01:06:36,405 --> 01:06:37,838
I don't Iike to be threatened.

739
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:39,999
l'm not threatening you,
l'm threatening Carter.

740
01:06:40,109 --> 01:06:41,098
Touch.

741
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:43,303
An audacious man. Who are you?

742
01:06:43,812 --> 01:06:45,575
My money, yes or no?

743
01:06:47,716 --> 01:06:48,705
No.

744
01:06:52,421 --> 01:06:54,685
Carter? Carter?

745
01:06:55,724 --> 01:06:57,385
Carter, what's happening?

746
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:01,020
Get some peopIe down
to Commerce street. Now.

747
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:02,422
Carter?

748
01:07:03,432 --> 01:07:05,559
Speak to me. Carter?

749
01:07:05,668 --> 01:07:08,660
You just don't get it, do you,
you dumb fuck?

750
01:07:10,205 --> 01:07:12,730
I sure hope you're taIking to him
and not me.

751
01:07:12,841 --> 01:07:14,809
Carter! Carter!

752
01:07:14,943 --> 01:07:16,069
l just croaked Carter.

753
01:07:16,178 --> 01:07:18,408
l want you to call Fairfax
and tell him that.

754
01:07:18,514 --> 01:07:20,345
Smoke them if you got 'em, asshoIe.

755
01:07:20,916 --> 01:07:23,009
You've got 24 hours Ieft to breathe.

756
01:07:23,118 --> 01:07:26,383
That's one day to get
your tiny IittIe worId in order.

757
01:07:26,488 --> 01:07:29,286
Do you understand that, sweetheart?
Do you?

758
01:07:29,825 --> 01:07:32,020
Porter, Porter, Porter, get my money.

759
01:07:32,728 --> 01:07:35,094
-l see him, l see him, l see him.
-Come on, come on, come on.

760
01:07:35,197 --> 01:07:36,357
Right here.

761
01:07:39,034 --> 01:07:41,901
-l don't see any cash.
-They write you a check?

762
01:07:42,338 --> 01:07:45,102
They gave me the run around.
l have to go and see another guy.

763
01:07:45,207 --> 01:07:47,767
Last one, then we got a dead woman,
an assault,

764
01:07:47,876 --> 01:07:50,470
and all kinds of stuff
to talk to you about.

765
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:54,037
That means more paperwork, Porter,
and we don't like paperwork.

766
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:58,648
Damn shame, Porter,
but don't let the bastards get you down.

767
01:08:00,022 --> 01:08:02,456
That's right, Porter. Don't give up.

768
01:08:05,728 --> 01:08:08,424
-Hey, can l have my piece back?
-Oh, yeah.

769
01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:21,198
Nice roscoe, Porter.
Heavy enough to be a nutcracker.

770
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:23,071
We'll be in touch, Rocky.

771
01:08:25,381 --> 01:08:26,905
Keep up the good work.

772
01:08:27,049 --> 01:08:29,176
Rocky? Where did you get Rocky from?

773
01:08:29,284 --> 01:08:32,117
Squirrel on the cartoon.
Rocky and BuIIwinkIe.

774
01:09:20,235 --> 01:09:22,533
Good to have you back in town,
Mr. Fairfax.

775
01:09:22,638 --> 01:09:24,299
l wish l could say l was glad to be back.

776
01:09:24,406 --> 01:09:26,966
l was swimming with the dolphins
this morning.

777
01:09:28,744 --> 01:09:29,768
Easy, would you?

778
01:09:29,878 --> 01:09:32,676
lt's genuine alligator, for God's sake.
What's the matter with you?

779
01:09:32,781 --> 01:09:34,476
Sorry, Mr. Fairfax.

780
01:09:35,651 --> 01:09:37,915
-Hello, Mr. Fairfax.
-How's it going, Charlie?

781
01:09:42,291 --> 01:09:43,952
Well, between us
and our neighborhood cops,

782
01:09:44,059 --> 01:09:46,550
l'd say we got him
pretty well covered, huh?

783
01:09:47,763 --> 01:09:49,230
Walter, wake up.

784
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,660
Walter!

785
01:09:53,268 --> 01:09:54,428
Wake up!

786
01:09:55,471 --> 01:09:57,132
Keep those bags up, boys.

787
01:09:58,173 --> 01:10:01,631
-Who the hell are you?
-l'm the reason you're back early.

788
01:10:03,378 --> 01:10:04,902
-You're Porter?
-That's right.

789
01:10:05,013 --> 01:10:06,844
Keep those bags up above
shoulder level, boys.

790
01:10:06,949 --> 01:10:08,678
You drop them and l'll drill you.

791
01:10:12,354 --> 01:10:15,482
Well, what'll you have me do,
stand on my head?

792
01:10:16,124 --> 01:10:19,560
No. l want you to do me a favor
and call Mrs. Bronson,

793
01:10:19,661 --> 01:10:21,788
see what we can do about my money.

794
01:10:21,897 --> 01:10:24,866
Well, she let Carter die.

795
01:10:25,334 --> 01:10:29,065
But that poor buck-toothed bastard
is probably better off dead anyway.

796
01:10:29,972 --> 01:10:31,906
She'd probably let me die, too.

797
01:10:32,007 --> 01:10:34,134
No, with Carter
she thought l was bluffing.

798
01:10:37,312 --> 01:10:38,506
Try her.

799
01:10:39,348 --> 01:10:40,406
All right.

800
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:43,777
You two are fired.

801
01:10:47,356 --> 01:10:49,847
Hello? Yes, it's like this.

802
01:10:50,425 --> 01:10:53,417
l'm standing in my living room
and there's a man here named Porter

803
01:10:53,529 --> 01:10:56,896
who says that he expects you
to pay him sooner or later.

804
01:10:58,233 --> 01:10:59,666
Yes, of course.

805
01:11:00,702 --> 01:11:03,728
-She wants to talk to you.
-Put her on the speaker.

806
01:11:10,078 --> 01:11:11,306
This is Porter.

807
01:11:11,413 --> 01:11:13,540
I shouId probabIy have you
just shoot Fairfax

808
01:11:13,649 --> 01:11:16,209
and then hire you to run the city for me.

809
01:11:16,318 --> 01:11:19,776
Too bad you're just a punk
with the right baIIs-to-brains ratio.

810
01:11:20,389 --> 01:11:24,052
Honey, I wouIdn't even
get out of bed for 130 grand.

811
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:26,850
You people aren't listening.
lt's not 130 grand...

812
01:11:26,962 --> 01:11:30,454
No, you Iisten.
You got no pIace to go, Porter.

813
01:11:30,866 --> 01:11:33,801
You're finished.
Do you get what I'm taIking about?

814
01:11:35,137 --> 01:11:36,195
Fairfax?

815
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:38,329
-Hey, what the hell are you doing, man?
-Fairfax?

816
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,874
-Are you okay?
-Yes. No, it's all right.

817
01:11:40,976 --> 01:11:44,810
He's just killing my alligator bags
and shooting holes in my suit.

818
01:11:44,913 --> 01:11:48,041
-Man, that's just mean.
-Okay, Porter, I give up.

819
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:50,184
Where do you wanna
pick up your money?

820
01:11:51,186 --> 01:11:52,551
King's Cross Station.

821
01:11:52,654 --> 01:11:55,748
Send one man
with a blue backpack full of cash.

822
01:11:56,091 --> 01:11:57,888
l'll be on the platform.

823
01:11:58,126 --> 01:12:01,721
-What's the name of the stop?
-lt's the end of the line.

824
01:12:02,631 --> 01:12:04,292
For you, too, sweetheart.

825
01:12:10,072 --> 01:12:12,563
You just signed your own death warrant
for $130,000.

826
01:12:12,674 --> 01:12:17,338
l don't... l don't get that. What is it,
the principle or something, huh?

827
01:12:17,913 --> 01:12:20,438
No, l just want my money back.

828
01:12:26,622 --> 01:12:28,419
And it's only 70.

829
01:12:29,024 --> 01:12:31,788
70? What do you mean it's only 70?

830
01:12:32,227 --> 01:12:34,024
Only 70,000?

831
01:12:34,763 --> 01:12:36,822
Hell, my suits are worth more than that.

832
01:12:37,599 --> 01:12:40,534
Listen to this. ''Ocean Ray Sundancer.

833
01:12:41,036 --> 01:12:45,268
''Vacuum-flush head. 80,000 bucks.''

834
01:12:47,309 --> 01:12:49,402
l'm telling you, you ain't gonna have it.

835
01:12:49,511 --> 01:12:52,639
-You wanna bet?
-No, l don't wanna bet.

836
01:12:53,181 --> 01:12:54,876
l'm out $150 already.

837
01:12:56,351 --> 01:13:00,515
$150 l'm getting my damn boat.
Better come down with something.

838
01:13:00,622 --> 01:13:01,987
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

839
01:13:02,724 --> 01:13:04,487

we're Holland and Vanowen.
lnternal Affairs.

841
01:13:10,699 --> 01:13:13,133
You boys wanna back off?
We're on a stakeout here.

842
01:13:13,235 --> 01:13:16,204
-You wanna step out of the car, please?
-What for?

843
01:13:16,304 --> 01:13:18,738
l think you better
step out of the car, Detectives.

844
01:13:29,951 --> 01:13:32,852
-What the hell's going on?
-l don't know.

845
01:13:33,689 --> 01:13:36,988
ls this your badge, Detective?
The one you reported missing?

846
01:13:39,494 --> 01:13:42,554
-Yeah. Where'd you find it?
-Where exactly did you lose it?

847
01:13:46,334 --> 01:13:47,961
Does this belong to you?

848
01:13:53,675 --> 01:13:57,008
-lt's Porter. Follow him.
-l got that motherfucker.

849
01:14:07,456 --> 01:14:08,514
Hey.

850
01:14:14,262 --> 01:14:15,729
Get in, Porter.

851
01:14:22,437 --> 01:14:23,699
Close the door.

852
01:14:25,173 --> 01:14:27,266
Now set the roscoe on the floor.

853
01:14:29,411 --> 01:14:30,503
Slow.

854
01:14:34,816 --> 01:14:38,684
See, l am gonna turn you in
to the outfit for a reward.

855
01:14:38,887 --> 01:14:41,685
And maybe they'll be so impressed
that they'll ask me to join,

856
01:14:41,790 --> 01:14:43,519
and l'll be on easy street.

857
01:14:43,825 --> 01:14:45,793
Medical, dental.

858
01:14:46,995 --> 01:14:49,657
l'm just... l'm gonna walk you right in.

859
01:14:49,898 --> 01:14:51,627
Porter on the hoof.

860
01:14:52,167 --> 01:14:54,101
Unless you get rambunctious.

861
01:14:54,202 --> 01:14:57,296
Then l'll just have
to take care of you myself...

862
01:15:00,008 --> 01:15:02,408
You're not gonna fucking kill me,
are you?

863
01:15:09,484 --> 01:15:10,712
Let him go.

864
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:13,646
Now.

865
01:15:19,294 --> 01:15:20,818
Hubba, hubba, hubba.

866
01:16:48,917 --> 01:16:52,182
Hey. Hey. Hey, Porter!

867
01:16:52,687 --> 01:16:53,711
Hey!

868
01:16:54,856 --> 01:16:56,289
Hey, come on!

869
01:17:23,418 --> 01:17:26,353
Hey, handsome. This is a loading zone.

870
01:17:27,722 --> 01:17:29,053
So move me.

871
01:17:30,292 --> 01:17:31,452
So move.

872
01:17:32,694 --> 01:17:33,888
You Porter?

873
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:36,955
Over there by your buddy. U-turn.

874
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:00,815
We're taking a new position. Get in.

875
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:11,828
-Where to?
-Relax and you'll survive this.

876
01:18:12,434 --> 01:18:15,164
Keep your hands where l can see them.
Take the next left.

877
01:18:22,177 --> 01:18:25,340
You know, l think l fucked you once.

878
01:18:26,481 --> 01:18:27,607
Oh, yeah?

879
01:18:31,553 --> 01:18:33,544
What do you think
the odds are on twice?

880
01:18:38,059 --> 01:18:41,495
-l'll meet you at the L in 10 minutes.
-l'll be there.

881
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:50,399
l don't think your odds are good.

882
01:18:53,441 --> 01:18:55,068
You got anything to say?

883
01:18:55,877 --> 01:18:57,367
No, thank you.

884
01:18:57,979 --> 01:18:59,412
Then just stay here.

885
01:19:25,573 --> 01:19:26,699
Don't move.

886
01:19:27,642 --> 01:19:29,667
You got any friends here
l should know about?

887
01:19:29,778 --> 01:19:31,643
You should try the men's room.

888
01:20:28,236 --> 01:20:29,260
Hey.

889
01:20:31,372 --> 01:20:32,430
Porter?

890
01:20:40,148 --> 01:20:42,639
Step back here. Come on.

891
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:04,063
The guy says you should drink this.

892
01:21:04,372 --> 01:21:06,033
-What guy?
-Me.

893
01:21:06,174 --> 01:21:07,903
Take it in your right hand.

894
01:21:10,879 --> 01:21:12,346
Sit down.

895
01:21:14,782 --> 01:21:16,181
Where's your piece?

896
01:21:16,718 --> 01:21:18,515
-Lunchbox.
-Open it.

897
01:21:21,356 --> 01:21:22,448

You think you can make
everything okay, don't you?

How strong are you, Porter?

909
01:24:58,339 --> 01:25:01,035
You know, this may sound crazy,
Porter, but...
