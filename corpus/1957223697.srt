00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:22,147
(telephone ringing)

3
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,648
- [Operator] 911.
What's your emergency?

4
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,150
- [Man] I, I, I, I
don't, I don't know.

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,278
I, I'm, I just got home and
my front door is wide open

6
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,239
and there's, there's,
there's blood everywhere.

7
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,408
Billy, you stay there.
Do not come in here!

8
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,951
- [Operator] Sir, can you
see anyone injured inside?

9
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,786
- [Man] I don't, I don't
know! I don't know!

10
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,997
My, my wife, she's
here, I know she's here,

11
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,290
but I can't find her.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,499
- [Operator] Sir,
listen carefully.

13
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,834
I need you to leave
the house now.

14
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,003
Do you understand?
Step out of the house.

15
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,465
- [Man] Oh my God. Oh my God.

16
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,259
No, no, no!

17
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,178
- Sir. Sir.
- No!

18
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,554
- [Operator] Emergency
vehicles are on their way.

19
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,139
- [Man] Oh my God, no!

20
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,015
- Sir.
- No.

21
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,561
(ominous music)

22
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,288
(elevator dings)

23
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:22,582
- No.

24
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,876
No, I didn't talk to him.

25
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,337
Because he was on call today.

26
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,674
No, I don't know his
schedule, you psycho.

27
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,512
(scoffs) Yes, I
know. He's very cute.

28
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,600
Hmm? Mm, not really.

29
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,565
Uh, no. I'm good, actually.

30
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,359
I also have that
pizza in the freezer,

31
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,985
so I can just make that.

32
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,782
Are you serious? I was gonna...

33
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,534
Fine. Fine, I'll
go to the store.

34
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,993
Do you want anything?

35
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,371
(scoffs) Oh, you're not hungry?

36
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,497
Yeah, I wonder why.

37
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,040
Maybe because you ate my pizza.

38
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,131
(scoffs)
(suspenseful music)

39
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,800

43
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,080
(waves crashing)

44
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,176
- Baby.
- Hey.

45
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,636
- How's it going?

46
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,014
- (sighs) Well, I haven't
smashed my laptop yet,

47
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,682
so I feel like it's
a moral victory.

48
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,767
- Oh, that's good.
- Yeah.

49
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,477
- (groans) I don't
know, I think maybe

50
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,938
I should stay here this
weekend and work on it.

51
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,189
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

52
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,234
- Wait, what? No.

53
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,360
- The deadline is Monday.

54
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,528
- No, forget that.

55
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,697
- I have-
- No, there's no way.

56
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,365
We're going. We're going.

57
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,659
- Oh my God. Oh, I'm so tight.

58
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,787
- Oh, you are, uh,
are kind of tense.

59
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,621
- Uh-huh. (laughs)

60
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,373
How can you tell?

61
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,583
- Well, you know, I'm a doctor.

62
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,625
I'm trained in these matters.

63
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,585
(woman laughs)
I know where

64
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,836
all the parts are.

65
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,256
- (laughs) Do you have
a cure for me, Doctor?

66
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,092
- (laughs) I do.
I do have a cure.

67
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,887
Maybe I'll whip
up a cure for you.

68
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,265
- Ah, okay.
- Let's put you like this.

69
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,933
This is all very scientific

70
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,270
with pressure
points and chakras-

71
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,105
- I see.
- And things like that.

72
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,148
- Uh-huh.
- Feel that?

73
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,817
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, that feels good.

74
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,445
(woman giggles)

75
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,366

76
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,676
(woman moaning)

77
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,846
- Oh, yeah. (moans)

78
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:33,851
Oh, baby. (moaning)

79
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,484
(twig snaps)

80
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:42,819
What was that?
- Okay, babe, don't stop.

81
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:47,824
Come on!
- Okay. (moaning)

82
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,414
- Okay, don't stop.

84
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,335

(fire crackling)

86
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,967
- Go check.

87
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,094
- Oh, come on.
- Babe, go check.

88
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:10,721
- Fuck!

89
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:16,519
I can't believe this shit.

90
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,981
(woman gasps)
- Okay, bro.

91
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,649
Game's over. You've
had your fun.

92
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,945
Fucking pervert.

93
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,031

94
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,283

days for a little R&R.

you say deadline?

Look, I told Roger we'd have
the new pages by Tuesday.

No, you do not.

Listen, come over to my

kick back a couple of
martinis, you'll be fine.

137
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,782

I'm gonna stick to the plan.

have your pages by Monday.

to do with the doctor?

part of the plan.

There's a cabin next door,
but nobody's ever there.

180
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:50,371
Fridge is full of food,
but there's no booze.

181
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,915
Giving you a heads up
there. Plan accordingly.

182
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,834
All right, I'll try it later.

183
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:55,960
Love you. Bye.

184
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,671
♪ Yeah, the DJ in our head

185
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,632
♪ Has got us feelin'

186
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,859
(low ominous music)

187
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,839
(suspenseful music)

188
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,002
(traffic whooshing)

189
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,284
(mellow music)

190
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,307
- Something.
- You sure?

191
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,850
Oh, good afternoon.

192
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,102
- Wine.

193
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,353
- (chuckles) Pretty
much some pickings,

194
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,604
but what we have is
on the back wall.

195
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,647
- Thank you.

196
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,233
(gentle music)

197
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,450
(dog barking)

198
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,584
(dog yelps)

199
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,170
(gentle music)

200
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,181
- Not much of a
selection, is there?

201
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,727
- (chuckles) No. (laughs)

202
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,978
- Shh.

203
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,564
(gentle music)

204
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,796
- Oh. Oh.

205
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,923
Is there a party I
wasn't invited to?

206
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:30,841
- I'm sorry?

207
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,553
Oh, no, just stocking
up for the weekend.

208
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,056
- Okay. For a moment there,
my feelings were hurt.

209
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,976
So, uh, you staying up this way?

210
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,563
- Yeah. Yeah, my
boyfriend's family's cabin.

211
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,940
Much needed peace and
quiet for a couple days.

212
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,525
- Oh, yeah? Which cabin is that?

213
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,490
- Really angling for
that party invite, huh?

214
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,951
- I'm sorry. We're
really nosy up here.

215
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,496
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.

216
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,332
It's big city manners, right?

217
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,709
The Conrad cabin in Northdale.

218
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,378
(ominous music)

219
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,049
- 35.47.

220
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,343
- Oh, uh, okay.

221
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,096
Thanks.

222
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,347
- You be careful up there.

223
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,185
I mean, there's not much
in the way of humans

224
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,229
this time of year, if
you know what I mean.

225
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,275
- Well, you know,
I'm counting on that,

226
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,693
so you know what I mean.

227
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,736
(both laugh)
- Yeah.

228
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,200
- Well, it was nice
chatting with you.

229
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,869
- You, too.

230
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,389
- Sam.

231
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,516
- Mind your own business, Dina.

232
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,434
We don't know nothing
about nothing yet.

233
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,770
- You shoulda told her.

234
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,404
(traffic whooshing)

235
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,746

237
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,734
(majestic music)

238
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,254
(dramatic music)

239
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,317
(cell phone chiming)

240
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,193
- Hi there.

241
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,154
- Hey, I got you.

242
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,948
- [Blake] Yes. Yes, you have.

243
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,532
- Wasn't sure if I'd reached you

244
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,701
with the shitty cell
service up there.

245
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:49,164
- Well, lucky me. My
GPS says three miles.

246
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,999
- Oh, wow. You're almost there.

247
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:54,002
Welcome to Northdale. Really?

248
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,297
Home of the, uh, I don't know
what they're the home of,

249
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,383
but it's ours for the weekend.

250
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,261
- Oh, I can't wait.

251
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,680
I wish you were coming tonight.

252
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,932
- Oh, me, too.

253
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,476
After this fucking week. Brutal.

254
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:13,063
- Come to me, babe.
I'll make it all better.

255
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,107
- Yeah, I'm aware
of your skillset.

256
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,900
It's what gets me
through the day.

257
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,360
Hey, but look at it this way.

258
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,779
You're gonna have a whole
day to work on the book. Yay!

259
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,073
- Ugh, God, I have no
interest in writing

260
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,741
for three-year-olds anymore.

261
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,703
They're stupid. They lack
all thought and reason.

262
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,914
- Aw, you're gonna make a
wonderful mother someday.

263
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:33,500
(Blake laughs)

264
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,212
(birds calling)

265
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,305
(insect buzzing)

266
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,023
(ominous music)

267
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,577
You got my message, right?

268
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,870
- Yes. Yes, thank you.

269
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,122
I would've died without wine.

270
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:15,751
- Wow.
- Stop. You know what I mean.

271
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,836
- I do. You're a
snot-flying drunk.

272
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,505
- Hey, I think I'm here.

273
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,890
- It's nice, right?

274
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,268
- What? The front door is open.

275
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,980
(cell phone crackling)

276
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,148
Jack?
- Hello?

277
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,109
Blake!

278
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:43,487
- Jack?

279
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,615
Shit.

280
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,284
(ominous music)

281
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:53,932
Hello?

282
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,063
Is there anybody here?

283
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,775
Hello?

284
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,824
(suspenseful music)

285
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,412
Hello?

286
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,415
(suspenseful music)

287
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:59,975
Oh. (chuckles)

288
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,186
(sighs)

289
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,988
(ominous music)

290
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,189
(birds chirping)

291
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,652
(ominous music)

292
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,329
(fire crackling)

293
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,089
Mm.

294
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,886
(clicking)

295
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,555
(ominous music)

296
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,694
(clicking)

297
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:55,924
(clicking)

298
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,927
(suspenseful music)

299
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:18,988
(scraping)

300
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,285
(suspenseful music)

301
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,833
(scraping)

302
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:44,556
(sighs) God, get a
grip, Sinclair! Oh.

303
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,266
(glass shatters)
(Blake screams)

304
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:50,311
(gasping) Who's out there?

305
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,147
Is somebody out there?

306
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,485
(suspenseful music)

307
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:04,677
(papers slam)
(woman gasps)

308
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,471
- Ah!
- For reals?

309
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,806
- Payback's a bitch.

310
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,642
- You look tired.

311
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,519
- That's because I am.

312
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,395
- ER 8 is open.
Take a quick nap.

313
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,688
- Oh, that sounds so good.

314
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,983
Thank you. Another whole pile.

315
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,778
Um, yeah, that'd be good
because Blake would kill me

316
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:23,112
if I slept all weekend.

317
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,784
- Oh, that's right.
This is the big weekend.

318
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,078
Nervous?
- No.

319
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,665
Maybe a little.
- Don't be.

320
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,750
You have nothing to worry about.

321
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,043
You're two peas in a pod.

322
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,754
- Oh, that's really corny.

323
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:41,589
But thank you.

324
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,968
Should probably hang
on to these, Heather.

325
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,719
I have a nap to do.

326
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,637
Wake me in an hour!

327
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,932
- Sure thing.

328
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:51,766
Why not?

329
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,271
(crickets chirping)

330
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,331

(faint background chattering)

336
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,364
(knocking)
- Hmm?

337
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:12,949
- Some, uh, interesting reading.

338
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:17,996
- My wife gets 'em, and
then she quizzes me.

339
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,747
- Your secret's
safe with me, sir.

340
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,043
- Is there something
I can help you with?

341
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,879
- It's talking about
this. Just came in.

342
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,926
(ominous music)

343
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,013
- Northdale.
- Yep.

344
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,683
- Isn't that where-
- Uh-huh.

345
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,436
(dramatic music)

346
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,659

00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:21,285
(ominous music)

350
00:35:56,904 --> 00:36:00,158
(telephone ringing)

351
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,368
- [Blake] Hi, this is
Blake. Leave me a message.

352
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,703
(phone beeps)

353
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,539
- Baby! Hey, I'm on my way.

354
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,959
I gotta make a quick little
stop at the hospital.

355
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,044
I promise I'm in
and out two minutes.

356
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,463
And then I'm coming after you.

357
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:17,425
Can't wait to see you.
You better not be smoking.

358
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,637
(water trickling)

359
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:53,377

00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,641

361
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,310
(ominous music)

362
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:17,735
(twig snaps)

363
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,928

364
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,549
(eerie music)

365
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:43,404
(thudding)
(suspenseful music)

366
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,449
(thudding)

367
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,163
(thudding)
(suspenseful music)

368
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,915
- Hey! Hey, I know that
you're out there, okay?

369
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:55,916
This isn't funny.

370
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,377
Just leave me alone!

371
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,257
(rock thudding)

372
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,968
(dramatic music)

373
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,105
(Blake screams)

374
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,818
Oh my God! Oh my God!

375
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,447
(dramatic music)

376
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,329
(Blake whimpering)

377
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,499
Hello? Come out!

378
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,585
Help! Is anybody home?

379
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,337
Please? Hello, hello?

380
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,341
Hello? Help, help!

381
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,178
Hello? Anybody?

382
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,097
Hello, is anybody home?

383
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,518
(Blake panting)

384
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,231
(suspenseful music)

385
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,617
(ominous music)

386
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:16,307
(woman panting)

00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:30,279
(Blake panting)

388
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:33,282
(suspenseful music)

389
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:56,931
Shit.

390
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,600
(dramatic music)

391
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,112
Okay.

392
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,451
No, no, no! Shit, shit!

393
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,121
Fucking kidding me!

394
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,874
(dramatic music)

395
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,629
Oh.

396
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,130
Excuse me, sir!

397
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,632
Sir, can you help-

398
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:37,721
(cell phone chiming)

399
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,523
(Blake whimpering)

400
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:56,240
(ominous music)
(cell phone chiming continues)

401
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:03,747
- Blake?

402
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,002
Hello? Baby, can you hear me?

403
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,045
Blake? Hello?

404
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,928
(phone ringing)

405
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,597
Hey, baby. I lost you for a-

406
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,393
(man grunting)

407
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,483
(phone ringing)

408
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,861
- [Blake] Hi, this is
Blake. Leave me a message.

409
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,196
(phone beeps)

410
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,866
(ominous music)

411
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,261
- Fuck it.

412
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,723
Call Anza Sheriff's Department.

413
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:06,393
(phone ringing)

414
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:08,896
- Oh, no, no.

415
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,566
I'll get it.

416
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,404
Sheriff Logan.

417
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:20,074
- Hi, this is Dr. Jack Conrad.

418
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,701
I'm calling because I'm
hoping I can get someone

419
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,745
to do a wellness check for me.

420
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,122
- Is this a medical emergency?

421
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,957
- Uh, I don't, I don't know.

422
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:32,169
Really it's more of a
gut feeling, I guess.

423
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,673
It's, it's, it's my fiance,
well, my, my girlfriend.

424
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,759
Her name's Blake Sinclair,
and she's up there alone,

425
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:41,387
and I have not been able
to get in touch with her.

426
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,264
- Cell phone service around
here is sketchy at best.

427
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,766
Drives us nuts.

428
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,017
- Oh, no, I know, I get it.

429
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,436
But there's something,
something strange here

430
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:52,272
because I, I've, I've
called several times

431
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,566
and it's always gone
straight to voicemail.

432
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:58,362
And the last time I called,
someone picked up the phone.

433
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:00,072
I mean, I could,
I could hear them.

434
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,408
It was like, someone was there,
I could hear 'em listening,

435
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,661
but no one talked, and
then it disconnected.

436
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:08,205
I called right back,
and then it sounded like

437
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,833
someone was smashing
the phone or something.

438
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,835
- Okay. What's her location?

439
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,505
- Well, she's up in Northdale
at my family's cabin.

440
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:19,466
- Northdale?
- Yeah. Yeah.

441
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,844
It's about four
miles out of town

442
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,596
off the Douglas Pine Highway.

443
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:26,473
- Stand by Doctor.

444
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:27,307
Talley!

445
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,101
Get in here.

446
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:39,153
Doctor, what's your address
up there in Northdale?

447
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,947
- [Jack] 31 South Sycamore.

448
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,741
- 31 South Sycamore.

449
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,285
Is this the number
I can reach you on

450
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,120
with the 479 area code?

451
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,331
Yeah, yeah, that's my cell.
I'm on my way up there now.

452
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,625
- We're about an
hour from there.

453
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,961
I'll send a patrol car
up there to take a look.

454
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:59,590
- (sighs) Thank you.
Appreciate that.

455
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,341
Like I said, I don't know
why this is bugging me.

456
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:04,136
It's more of a gut
feeling, I guess, but-

457
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,929
- Sometimes those
are the best kind.

458
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,682
Drive carefully.
- [Jack] Thanks.

459
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,645
- Northdale?
- Yeah, Northdale.

460
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,732
- It's a pretty popular
place as of late.

461
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,443
- Yeah, I have to
agree with you on that.

462
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,278
So many things going missing.

463
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,281
Why don't you take a
little ride up there

464
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,699
and poke around a bit?

465
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,659
- Copy that.

466
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:39,338
(crickets chirping)

467
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:42,007
(ominous music)

468
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:52,351
(Blake gasps)

469
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,480
(ominous music)

470
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,453

471

472
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:07,861
(Blake grunts)

473
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:10,864

(crickets chirping)

487
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:23,186
(thudding)

488
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:25,731

(car horn honks)

502
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,066
- Jack?

503
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,069
Oh, come on, Jack.

504
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,739
(Blake sobbing)

505
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:25,035

(Blake groans)

510
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,871
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

511
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,124
Oh God, oh God.

512
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:17,087
(Blake whimpering)

513
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,011
(Blake gasping)

514
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,764
Oh, Jack, no. What
are you doing?

515
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,778
(Blake sobbing)

516
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,869
Jack! Open the
door, open the door!

517
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,705
Open the door! Oh, oh, Jack!

518
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,581
Oh, God, we gotta
get outta here!

519
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:56,376
There's a man, and
he was in the house.

520
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,169
We gotta get, oh my God!

521
00:54:58,169 --> 00:55:00,922
(Blake screaming)

522
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:17,856
(Blake sobbing)

523
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:20,900
No!

524
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,532
(Blake sobbing)

525
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,451
Why are you doing this?

526
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,621
Why are you doing this?

527
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:39,252
(suspenseful music)

528
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,473

(indistinct radio chatter)

531
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,122
- That's weird.
- Talley!

532
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,291
Talley!

533
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,794
- Go, Sheriff.

534
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:05,255
- You've gotta make it
over to the Conrad house.

535
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,758
We haven't heard from him
and he's not picking up.

536
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:11,845
Something's not right.

537
00:57:13,304 --> 00:57:14,806
- On my way.

538
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:17,767
- I wanna hear something the
minute you hear something.

539
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:18,893
You got that?

540
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:19,811
- Yes, sir.

541
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,938
- And Lynn.
- Sir?

542
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,274
