1
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:05,797
(intense dramatic music)

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,925
(graphics whooshing)

3
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,470
(intense dramatic music)

4
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,563
(upbeat pop music)

5
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:19,412
[Samantha] It seems everyone
has found love but me.

6
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,622
What is love?

7
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:24,000
And where do you
find a good man?

8
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,460
Could you tell me, please?

9
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,214
I want to walk in the
park with someone.

10
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,425
I want to laugh with
the love of my life.

11
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,305
And when will I
find that true love?

12
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,102
It must be true that all men

13
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:45,814
are broken, busted, misfits,

14
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,273
married,

15
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,315
or

16
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,151
In jail.

17
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,113
What does it take to
have a good marriage?

18
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,740
Heck, even a good relationship?

19
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,831
[Host] And minimizing your
television and phone time

20
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:06,126
before bed, but keeping
everything ready for morning.

21
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,253
For example, if you
wish to go to the gym,

22
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,880
then put out your gym
outfit before you go to bed.

23
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,010
All right. What are
we watching today?

24
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,851
Hey, we watching
something that's telling me

25
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,263
how to get up early.

26
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,306
Okay.

27
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,768
But I have a question for you.

28
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,855
Were you out to lunch when
I was talking about love?

29
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,484
With that being said,

30
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,486
I always wanted to
perform the wedding

31
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,197
of my daughter and
future son-in-law,

32
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,992
but honey, you can't marry hope.

33
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,368
You got to marry a man.

34
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,123
So let me give you
the pages of love.

35
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,960
For the letter A, you
want an anointed man.

36
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,254
Anybody can be dipped in water.

37
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,715
I'm talking about
the true anointing.

38
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,426
You want a man that
will accommodate,

39
00:02:56,468 --> 00:03:00,597
appreciate, accept,
and acknowledge you.

40
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,435
For the letter B, you want
a Bible-believing man,

41
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,687
a man that is benevolent,

42
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,231
a man that is not broke,

43
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,777
and one that will not
leave you brokenhearted.

44
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,737
Not broke. Not broke.

45
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,405
And for the letter C,

46
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,867
you can't seek comfort
under the covers.

47
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,370
You want a man that is credible,

48
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,164
concerned, considerate,

49
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,500
and will make a
commitment to you

50
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,086
and make you his centerpiece.

51
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,462
You know, like a classic man.

52
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:34,589
Mmm, I love a classic man.

53
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,800
So you want a companion?

54
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,135
No, my shirt says it all.

55
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,679
I have my dog,

56
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,139
'cause men are either
broke, married, busted,

57
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,100
or getting three squares a day.

58
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,935
Three squares? What's that?

59
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,188
Three square
meals a day in jail,

60
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,083
where the taxpayers are
paying for their medical,

61
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,566
dental, and vision.

62
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:58,196
Gotcha. Never heard it
put that way though before.

63
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,614
Well, I know someone.

64
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,575
His name is Mariano
and he's an accountant.

65
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,286
An accountant
or an errand boy?

66
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,538
Now wait a minute.

67
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,873
Would I suggest an
errand boy for you?

68
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,915
Hmm.

69
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,045
He jogs three miles
every evening in the park.

70
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,630
Want me to give him your number?

71
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,383
Don't give no broke,
busted bum my number.

72
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,801
I'll meet him there.

73
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:23,054
- Okay.
- Bye.

74
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,305
See you later.

75
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,320
(upbeat pop music)

76
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,964
Hoo, been a long time
since I had a steak.

77
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,507
You, uh, you mind? You got this?

78
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,470
Well, see, I was
running earlier,

79
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,180
and I didn't wanna be late,

80
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,515
so I, I left my wallet at home.

81
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:10,685
I got you next time.

82
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,856
(date sighs)

83
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,777
(knuckles rapping)

84
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,296
Knock, knock, baby
girl. How are you?

85
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,323
I'm doing good.
How are you doing?

86
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,949
I'm okay.

87
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,326
How was your date?

88
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,994
Well, I didn't
meet your next daddy,

89
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:29,371
if that's what you're asking.

90
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,998
Oh Jesus, Mom.

91
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,543
I'm really not trying
to see you be lonely.

92
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:40,256
How about you meet a
man on his death bed?

93
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,259
And that green can
keep you company,

94
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,011
if you know what I mean.

95
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,347
You're all the company
that I need, thank you.

96
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,684
Mmm, I wouldn't move so fast.

97
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,478
I can't fulfill those
needs right there.

98
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,313
Okay. Goodnight
and I love you.

99
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,314
Bye.

100
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,356
I love you, too.

101
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,987
Sugar daddy

102
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,573
dating website.

103
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,758
(traffic humming)

104
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:34,060
(indistinct background chatter)

105
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:34,894
[Samantha] Hi, are you Paul?

106
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,937
Yes I am.

107
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,439
Well, good
evening. How are you?

108
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,399
I'm sparkling fine.

109
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,067
But that's lookin' great.

110
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,402
I'm alive and not in jail.

111
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,362
Call it a win.

112
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,114
[Samantha] Hmm.

113
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,120
(phone ringing)

114
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,705
Hello?

115
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,374
- [Samantha] Hey, Mom.
- What's up?

116
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,418
[Samantha] I had
another bad date.

117
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,669
What happened?

118
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,273
[Samantha] He was
complimenting my breastuses

119
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,300
and basically said he's
glad he is not jail.

120
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,469
Honey, I'm sorry
that happened.

121
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,971
Well, today is Wednesday
and you know we'll have

122
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,432
our pajama party tonight
and we can talk about

123
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,017
the pages of love.

124
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,980
So come on over so we can
have our pajama party.

125
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,442
[Samantha] Okay. Can
you believe this dude?

126
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,485
I cannot.

127
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,570
Where did you meet
this person at?

128
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,073
[Samantha] Social
media datin'.

129
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,575
Well, I think it's time
to put social media dating

130
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,535
to bed, okay?

131
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,637
[Samantha] I agree,
'cause he was trying

132
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,121
to take me to bed.

133
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,581
Sorry about that, honey.

134
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,833
I'll see you later
tonight, okay?

135
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,503
- [Samantha] All right.
- All right. Bye-bye.

136
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,512
Oh, look at that.

137
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,307
You see how these
lions are fierce?

138
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:55,809
Yeah.

139
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,970
We need men to be fierce
about paying child support.

140
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:03,650
I'm sorry about your bad
date, but you will find love.

141
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,735
Did you ever meet
up with Mariano?

142
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,237
No, not till Saturday.

143
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,280
Well, he is a nice guy.

144
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,633
I don't like
blind dates by you,

145
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,659
and you say everybody is nice.

146
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,160
Mariano is nice.

147
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:17,205
But anyway, let's get
back to our pages of love

148
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,456
for the letter D.

149
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,875
You want a determined,
distinguished man,

150
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,004
one who won't leave
you disappointed.

151
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,423
I think you forgot
a D word in there.

152
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,632
What word was that?

153
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,342
You don't want a dog of a man?

154
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,344
No, you don't
want a dog of a man,

155
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,388
but don't compare
a dog and a man.

156
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,015
Dogs are loyal.

157
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,224
Hmm, that is so true.

158
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,768
I just don't have on
my dog T-shirt today.

159
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,187
Maybe you can
wear it tomorrow.

160
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,064
Now, on to the letter E.

161
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,192
For the letter E, you
want an educated man.

162
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,362
You want a man who is
eager to serve you.

163
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:53,491
You want a man who will enrich
your life and encourage you.

164
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,702
Lastly, you want a
man who will speak

165
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,912
edifying things over you.

166
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,667
For the letter F, you want
a man who is fond of you,

167
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,836
will make you his
favorite person,

168
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,589
and also a man that's
gonna be faithful.

169
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,052
I think you need to revamp
your pages of love, dear.

170
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,390
You forgot how many Black
men are distinguished?

171
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,560
Can you get off of
your Black thing?

172
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,104
Stop livin' in the past.

173
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,982
I know you have these
children and the Black men

174
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,194
aren't paying the child
support, but let's move on.

175
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,695
Find somebody who's nice,

176
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:33,531
who's gonna be willin'
to take care of you,

177
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,451
your lovely children,
and that's gonna be good.

178
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,036
You will find love.

179
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,162
A Black man?

180
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,748
I don't care what
color the man is.

181
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,502
Just find love and
live a full life.

182
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,462
Black love is true.

183
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,589
Black love is
true. It's got to be.

184
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,841
You see all these Black
people running around here?

185
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:54,177
They're doing
something to procreate.

186
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,555
Procreate. What
does that mean?

187
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,265
To make babies.

188
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,017
Mmm. Okay.

189
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,728
I'm gonna go ahead
and take the remote

190
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:07,315
because you are watching
too much Hallmark Channel.

191
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,025
Can you stop it?

192
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,654
[Samantha] Love
is always a gamble,

193
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,407
and I have been gambling
with my love life.

194
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,536
I've had my fair
share of bad men,

195
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:20,995
let me tell you.

196
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:25,250
There was Charles, who couldn't
charm his way into a job.

197
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,334
Then there was Scott

198
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,921
in sales who wanted
a side piece.

199
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,508
Then there was Kyrie,

200
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,343
who wanted you to pay.

201
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,475
Why do you and Dad have
such a good relationship?

202
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,561
Relationships are work.

203
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,521
We have a strong foundation.

204
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,483
We've got trust,
grace, peace, loyalty,

205
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,235
and a whole lot of love.

206
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:55,447
You talking like your
life is a Lifetime movie.

207
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,157
Well, your Dad loves me.

208
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,617
He's accepted you
as his daughter.

209
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,262
And where do you think
Lifetime is getting

210
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,370
those stories from?

211
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,831
Somebody's experiencing
a fairytale love.

212
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,332
Okay, well it ain't me.

213
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,168
But I don't want to
be one of those girls

214
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,354
who can't find love because
something's wrong with her.

215
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,672
Now it really is true
that all the good guys

216
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,175
are either taken or in jail.

217
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,926
Well, when you're
fishin' the gutter,

218
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,679
you're gonna come up
with sewage and rats.

219
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,014
Tell me about that.

220
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,850
Baby, it's all
in God's timin'.

221
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,643
Well, let's see
about God's timing

222
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,228
'cause I have a
date this Friday.

223
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,190
Why did you have
all those kids?

224
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:33,234
(laughs) Because
I was young, dumb,

225
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,363
full of eggs and I was looking
for somethin' supersized.

226
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,864
Did you find your supersize?

227
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,450
No, more like a
Hershey's chocolate chip.

228
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:42,869
Well, you've got no size now.

229
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,580
Stop lettin' those men
get you high off promises

230
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,333
and drunk off cheap dreams.

231
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,710
I like that one. You
should sell that phrase.

232
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:51,878
I think I may.

233
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,130
But I want you to stop it.

234
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,800
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay, good.

235
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:02,305
(kids playing)
(people talking indistinctly)

236
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,223
Hey.

237
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,367
[Samantha] Hi,
are you Mariano?

238
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,576
- Yeah. Are you Sam?
- [Samantha] Yes.

239
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,744
- Nice to meet you.
- [Samantha] Likewise.

240
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:07,787
- You look great.
- [Samantha] Thank you.

241
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,229
Thank you for coming out.

242
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,831
But you know you can take
off your mask, though.

243
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,065
I don't have Covid.

244
00:12:12,107 --> 00:12:14,401
[Samantha] You know,
it's okay. I'm good.

245
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,819
(Mariano laughs)

246
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,296
Well, your mom does say
nice things about you, though.

247
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,673
[Samantha] She says
that about everybody.

248
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,448
Oh, ha-ha. Okay.

249
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,492
[Samantha] Let's
cut the chit chat.

250
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,368
Are you single?

251
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,619
Yeah. Why do you ask?

252
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,888
[Samantha] Because I
ain't got time for games.

253
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,123
Okay, well, I'm
not playing any, but,

254
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,917
so do you wanna go on a
horseback ride with me actually?

255
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,086
[Samantha] What?
On an old nag?

256
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,922
No, like a horseback
through the country.

257
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,173
[Samantha] How much is it?

258
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,675
You don't have to
worry about that.

259
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,344
I'm a real man. I
pay for all of that.

260
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,595
[Samantha] Mmm, we'll see.

261
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:43,888
Come on. Let's go for a walk.

262
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,140
Get to know each other.

263
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,185
(bright pop music)

264
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,066
(horse chewing)

265
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,613
Thanks for coming on
this date with me.

266
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,407
Okay, this is a date?

267
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,575
Yes.
(rooster crows)

268
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,743
No.
Okay, then.

269
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,827
- Yes.
- Yes.

270
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:06,911
[Rae] Hi, guys.

271
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:07,829
- How you doing?
- Hi.

272
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,330
[Rae] Welcome to the ranch.

273
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,374
So I'm gonna walk you
guys through a little bit

274
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,501
of horse safety
before we get started.

275
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,794
Okay.

276
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:15,896
If you guys wanna follow
me over to the arena,

277
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,921
we can get started.

278
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,548
- Okay.
- Okay, great.

279
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,966
Gonna be fun.

280
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,223
So when we open the gate,

281
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,993
we always open the gate the
way that the horse is going in.

282
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,728
So if we're gonna go into the
gate, we wanna open it in.

283
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,563
That way she doesn't
get stuck in it.

284
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:34,731
[Samantha] Okay.

285
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:36,000
It's safe for you
guys, it's safe for her.

286
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,944
So I'm gonna have you
guys stand over here.

287
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,783
And I'm gonna turn her around.

288
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,493
[Samantha] Okay,
good. Thank you.

289
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,994
[Rae] You're welcome.

290
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,997
(engine rumbling)

291
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,753
Okay, you guys are
welcome to come in.

292
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,339
And I will shut the
gate behind you.

293
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,007
All right, so I'm
gonna move her over.

294
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,360
We're gonna walk in.
[Mariano] Okay.

295
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,736
So you guys can
stand on this side.

296
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,430
- [Mariano] Oh, sorry.
- [Rae] That's okay.

297
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,603
Come on. Stand right here.

298
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:14,645
Thank you.

299
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,113
Okay, here we go.

300
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,491
(Mariano talking indistinctly)
(Samantha laughs)

301
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,867
(Rae talking indistinctly)

302
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,285
All right, you ready to go?

303
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:30,537
Yup.

304
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,764
[Rae] All right, so
climb up to the very top.

305
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,873
It's gonna be wiggly
'cause it's on the sand.

306
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:35,542
All right, this hand goes here.

307
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,751
And.

308
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:39,838
Just get her.

309
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,215
One hand on the
back of the saddle.

310
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,509
There you go. And just
swing over and sit down.

311
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,679
There you go.
Oh my god.

312
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,890
[Rae] The saddle
is gonna move.

313
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:51,891
How do you feel?

314
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,393
- It's cool.
- [Rae] Good?

315
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:54,894
[Mariano] Yeah.

316
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,247
[Rae] All right, now I want
you to take a deep breath in.

317
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:59,649
Deep breath out.
Wiggle your shoulders.

318
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,735
It's supposed be fun.

319
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:04,320
You'll be all right.
Nah, feels good.

320
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,198
(bright pop music)

321
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,624
Ah, a horseback ride?

322
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,084
This is so nice.

323
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,587
And it is so refreshing for me

324
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,922
to not have to pay for the date.

325
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,632
I tell you, men.

326
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:27,844
Mmm.

327
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,054
He smells so good.

328
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,683
And oh, he feels good, too.

329
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,519
(bright pop music)

330
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:05,715
Thanks for the horseback ride.

331
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:06,984
Yeah, definitely. It was fun.

332
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,260
Thank you for coming out
on this date with me.

333
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,970
Hope I get to see
you soon again.

334
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,657
I don't let men come
to my house, I'm sorry.

335
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,433
Well, you can come to my
house and I can cook for you.

336
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,394
I'm free around
seven on Saturday.

337
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,897
You want me to come by
to meet your girlfriend?

338
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,148
(Mariano laughs)

339
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,149
I told you I ain't
got no girlfriend.

340
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,693
You the only one I'm seeing.

341
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,153
Only time we'll tell.

342
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:29,447
Okay, come on, let's go.

343
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:41,292
So how was your
date with Mariano?

344
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,128
[Samantha] It was
good. He's nice.

345
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,963
I told you.

346
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,840
[Samantha] You don't
know him like that.

347
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,759
Anyways, Alexa, is
it legal for men

348
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,094
to not pay child support?

349
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,181
[Alexa] Here's something
I found on the web.

350
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:58,018
According to huffpages.com,

351
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,021
each day thousands of
men are taken to court,

352
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,373
ordered to pay
their child support

353
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:04,733
and placed in jail
if they do not pay.

354
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:09,070
[Samantha] Thank you.
I like your response.

355
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,906
Well, Alexa can't help you,

356
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,992
but my pages of love can.

357
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,037
For the letter G,
you want a godly man.

358
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:21,041
You want a great, giving,
generous gentleman.

359
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,375
[Samantha] Yes.

360
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:26,629
Now for the letter H,
you want a happy, humorous,

361
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:31,259
healthy man and one that
won't leave you heartbroken.

362
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:34,429
For the letter I, you
want an inspirational,

363
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,973
intelligent man, and
you want a man that can

364
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,267
give you true intimacy,

365
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,062
because after the sex is gone,

366
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,064
intimacy will be what you need.

367
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,900
Now, that's enough
of our pages of love.

368
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,069
Let's get ready for bed, okay?

369
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,986
Goodnight.

370
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,196
[Samantha] Okay. Goodnight.

371
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,198
Thank you so much.
Okay.

372
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,879
(knuckles rapping)

373
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,716
- Hey.
- [Samantha] Hi.

374
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,218
Thanks for comin'.

375
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,553
[Samantha] Wow.
You have a nice home.

376
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,180
Has a woman's touch.

377
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:18,306
Is this Airbnb?

378
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,558
Oh, ha-ha. No, it's not.

379
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,104
But I am looking for
somebody to share this with.

380
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:25,397
Good luck.

381
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,856
Well, for a first date,

382
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,918
I thought we should do a
little bit of a Bible study,

383
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,777
if that's okay with you,

384
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,028
to come join me at the table?

385
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,863
Great. I have the
Bible on my phone.

386
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:36,866
- I bought you one.
- Oh, thank you.

387
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:37,908
No problem.

388
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:43,248
Let me anoint you with some
oil and do a little prayer.

389
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,335
"No weapon formed against
you shall prosper.

390
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,755
Lift up my eyes to the hill.

391
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,049
Where does my help come from?

392
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,843
My help comes from the Lord,

393
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,511
the maker of heaven and earth.

394
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,138
He will not let your foot slip.

395
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,140
He watches over you."

396
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,809
[Samantha] Hmm, first
date, Bible study.

397
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,813
Good start, but
what's the catch?

398
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:10,316
(gentle acoustic music)

399
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:22,078
"The Lord knows
the thoughts of man.

400
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,497
He knows that they are futile."

401
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:30,545
Amen. Thank you for
reading the word of God.

402
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:31,379
Definitely.

403
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,839
[Samantha] That was lovely.

404
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,049
Makes you think about that.

405
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,234
I think this is
a great first date,

406
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,509
reading the word of God.

407
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,029
- I'm glad.
- Can't go wrong with that.

408
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:39,846
I'm glad you had a good time.

409
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,056
I did.

410
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,658
I hope I get to see
you again for sure.

411
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,682
You will.

412
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:51,483
(melodic pop music)

413
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:19,594
Mmm.

414
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,179
How's your food?

415
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:22,263
Good, thank you.

416
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,808
No problem. Let
me get the check.

417
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,978
Oh.
You don't have your wallet?

418
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,565
You know what? I'm not here
to pay your damn bills.

419
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:33,817
I understand.

420
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:37,195
I want us to be successful
together, not apart.

421
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,863
I go to PTA
meetings by myself,

422
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,241
gymnastics by myself
as a single parent,

423
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,076
and it's quite embarrassing.

424
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,494
I understand.

425
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:47,539
I can't take away the pain
from your past relationships,

426
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,207
but I can fix it by
showing you how much

427
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,417
I adore and love you.

428
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,543
[Samantha] Mmm-hmm.

429
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:53,753
Okay.

430
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,106
You have a lot of
bad memories stored

431
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,548
in your mental Rolodex,

432
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,884
but now I think it's time
for you to hop on board

433
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,302
a cloud-based company man.

434
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,847
Come on, let's get outta here.

435
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,348
Did you find your wallet?

436
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,267
No.

437
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:08,494
I think they might
take Apple Pay, though.

438
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,061
I'll go check.
Okay.

439
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,580
(knuckles rapping)

440
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,338
- Hey.
- [Samantha] Hi!

441
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:37,255
Welcome.

442
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:38,298
Nice to see you again.

443
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,299
Likewise.

444
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:40,717
- Please, come sit down.
- Okay.

445
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:45,137
Okay.

446
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,266
(water bubbling)

447
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,976
Think this is all ready for you.

448
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:50,810
Okay.

449
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:51,978
Put one foot in here,

450
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,605
one foot up here.

451
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,482
Tell me a little bit
more about yourself.

452
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,317
Well, I love guns.

453
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:58,443
I'm a Christian.

454
00:21:58,485 --> 00:22:00,195
I like going to the gym.

455
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,530
I'm a single mom who
ain't got time for games

456
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:04,741
and I'm not gonna
sleep with you.

457
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:05,992
Well, all right.

458
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:07,136
I wasn't looking
for any of that,

459
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,454
but how old are your kids?

460
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:12,165
- 21 and 15.
- Oh, that's good.

461
00:22:12,207 --> 00:22:13,875
Can't wait to have
kids of my own.

462
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,087
Okay.

463
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,380
How does that feel?

464
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,857
It feels good, but
what are you up to?

465
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:20,715
How does it feel?

466
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:23,134
Oh, it feels good. Thank you.

467
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,386
No problem.

468
00:22:25,303 --> 00:22:27,597
So let's get this toe dried up.

469
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,728
I got a couple of selections
of paint for you, too.

470
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,562
Okay.

471
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:35,814
You wanna pick a color out?

472
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:39,484
Here's your couple
of options for you.

473
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:43,279
You like any of these?

474
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:44,364
I like this color here.

475
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:47,033
Okay, nice color.

476
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,411
Little bougie, but it's okay.

477
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,791
Oh, you like the
buttery colors, huh?

478
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,501
(Samantha giggles)

479
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:59,921
Okay, so this little
piggy went to the market.

480
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,843
(upbeat pop music)

481
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,127
So, what do you like to do?

482
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:43,131
I like to pray, travel, cook,

483
00:23:43,173 --> 00:23:44,883
and spend time with the kids.

484
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,510
Okay, so all the same
things I like doin'.

485
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:50,096
Okay.

486
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:53,099
(water bubbling)

487
00:23:53,141 --> 00:23:54,141
Okay.

488
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,645
I think we're all done here.

489
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:01,441
Just let those dry
up a little bit.

490
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:02,567
How does it look?

491
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,613
Wow, it looks better than
what any shop could do.

492
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,656
Oh, stop. It look that good?

493
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:10,158
- It does.
- I try.

494
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,495
So it was a fun date
with you today again.

495
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:14,871
I love always seeing you.

496
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,166
You mind coming back
next week, same time?

497
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,001
Sure. Sounds good.

498
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,294
You want anything else?

499
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:22,212
You got anything
else you wanna do?

500
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:23,880
You hungry or anything?

501
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:25,924
I actually am hungry.
I love Thai food.

502
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,526
Oh, there's a Thai pool
place around the corner

503
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,552
if you want to go after
your feet dry and all that.

504
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:31,012
Okay, sounds good.

505
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,448
Okay, let's just
wait for it to dry.

506
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:34,432
Then we can hit the road.

507
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:35,475
Okay.

508
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:36,851
Clean all this up, too.

509
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:45,694
(audience laughs)

510
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:50,532
(knuckles rapping)

511
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,288
Hey.
[Samantha] Hi!

512
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,415
- How you doin'?
- Good.

513
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:00,083
- You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.

514
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:01,376
Thank you for coming.

515
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:02,561
Please join me at the
dining room table.

516
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:04,462
I got a surprise for you.

517
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:05,690
[Samantha] What,
your girlfriend?

518
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:07,507
No, that's getting old.

519
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,300
That comment's
not funny anymore.

520
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,844
Neither are the
games men play.

521
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,429
Okay, but I'm
not just any man.

522
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,265
I'm a gentleman.
Hmm, okay.

523
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:16,599
Come on, come join me.

524
00:25:18,852 --> 00:25:22,939
Well, for today, I thought
I'd start by massaging

525
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:24,375
your hands and painting
your fingernails,

526
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:25,608
if that's okay with you.

527
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,526
Wow. Thank you.

528
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:29,029
This is a nice setup.

529
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,488
Thank you.

530
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,841
I got a couple colors
for you to pick out, too.

531
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:33,658
Which one would you like?

532
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,494
I think I'll go with
the Diamond Shimmer.

533
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:39,372
Oh, okay. Gettin' a
little bougie on me.

534
00:25:39,414 --> 00:25:40,707
Let's get started.

535
00:25:46,546 --> 00:25:51,593
I will try not to miss.
(Samantha giggles)

536
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:55,221
[Samantha] He's
painting my fingernails?

537
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:56,473
That's very nice.

538
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:58,641
But what's he getting
ready to ask for?

539
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:03,104
A car, a house, or me to
take care of his mama.

540
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:06,274
(bright upbeat music)

541
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,417
Here like this.

542
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:26,419
I'm like, what is going on?

543
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:28,421
Oh, no. I think
we're almost done.

544
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:30,423
Just about 10 more seconds.

545
00:26:30,465 --> 00:26:31,675
Yeah. How do you like 'em?

546
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,259
Wow, they look beautiful.

547
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:34,594
I like them.
Definitely.

548
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:35,512
Good job.

549
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:36,721
Thank you for coming again.

550
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,139
Same time next week?

551
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:39,224
Yes.

552
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,141
It's always a
pleasure to see you.

553
00:26:40,183 --> 00:26:41,393
Likewise.

554
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,853
I need to clean this
up for us a little bit

555
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:46,106
before you get on the road.

556
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,493
So, how's the love life?

557
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:01,496
[Samantha] (giggles)
There is none.

558
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,707
What about Mariano?

559
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:05,834
[Samantha] What about
him? He's just a man.

560
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:07,210
Next.

561
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:10,922
Okay, we're on to the letter
J for the pages of love.

562
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:14,551
For the letter J, you
want a joyful, jovial man,

563
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:16,970
one who will give you
the jewelry you want

564
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:19,472
and one who will
jump to help you.

565
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:20,724
[Samantha] Say that again.

566
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,100
For the letter K,

567
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:25,145
you want a
knowledgeable, kind man

568
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:28,440
and a kinky man if
that's what you want.

569
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:29,858
[Samantha] Mmm.

570
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:33,278
And for the letter I, you
want a man who is a leader,

571
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:36,823
a man who listens, a man
who is long suffering,

572
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:38,783
and a man who will love you.

573
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:47,375
[Character] Shut up!

574
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,877
(people laughing)

575
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:50,920
Shut up you in the back!

576
00:27:50,962 --> 00:27:52,213
[Character] No more presents!

577
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:53,882
You look beautiful today.

578
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:55,633
Thank you. You look nice, too.

579
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:56,843
Thank you.

580
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:59,554
But why do you change
your hair every day?

581
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,276
Why do you change
your clothes every day?

582
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:03,892
I just wanted to get to
know your likes and dislikes.

583
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:05,602
Out of all the
questions to ask,

584
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:06,644
why ask about my hair?

585
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,855
What you gonna do? Buy me some?

586
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:11,483
Yeah, I can buy you
anything you want.

587
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,734
You know what? I got go.

588
00:28:12,776 --> 00:28:14,027
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

589
00:28:14,069 --> 00:28:15,379
I'm sorry.
[Samantha] Have a good one.

590
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:17,864
Please don't leave. I'm
sorry about the question!

591
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:25,038
Mom, Mariano was nuts.

592
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,415
He asked me why do
I change my hair.

593
00:28:27,457 --> 00:28:28,625
Okay.

594
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:29,876
Okay?

595
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:32,337
You don't ask a Black
woman about her hair.

596
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:33,546
Nothing's wrong with it.

597
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:36,049
Maybe he just wants to
know what makes you you.

598
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:38,385
Then tear off a
check. Cash out.

599
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:40,512
PayPal or Venmo me then.

600
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,555
I don't think
he meant any harm.

601
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:44,057
How do you know?

602
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:47,352
Well, he has been our
family accountant for years.

603
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:50,313
(laughs) The family
accountant of what?

604
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:53,191
This family don't have
no Donald Trump money.

605
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:56,736
We took care of you
and your kids just fine.

606
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,571
So we in the shade room now?

607
00:28:58,613 --> 00:29:00,740
Look, why miss
out on a good man

608
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:03,785
for all the baggage
you have from the past?

609
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:05,203
Every man ain't good.

610
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:07,997
And you totin' around that
Bible like everybody's Jesus.

611
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,708
Everybody's not Jesus.

612
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:13,795
However, would you like
to be somebody's comfort,

613
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:15,755
convenience, or commitment?

614
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,048
Which one?

615
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,592
I want the comfort,
but what do you mean?

616
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:21,553
Comfort is just sex.

617
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:23,763
They come around
when they want sex

618
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:26,766
and then they don't come
back till they want more sex.

619
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:29,894
They're not around to
help you change your tire.

620
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:31,604
Also, convenience.

621
00:29:31,646 --> 00:29:34,649
They call you when
they can't get ahold

622
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,776
of their other girlfriend.

623
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,696
They're bored. So,
oh, nobody's around.

624
00:29:39,738 --> 00:29:41,740
Let me call her.

625
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:45,326
Now commitment, that is
when they are into you

626
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:48,830
and only you, and what
you have going on.

627
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:50,790
So when you are
looking for them,

628
00:29:50,832 --> 00:29:53,126
you're not ghosted
'cause you can find them

629
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:57,505
because they're committed
to you and only you.

630
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:58,798
- Good material.
- Only you.

631
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,550
You need to preach
that in a sermon.

632
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:01,926
Hey, I'll think about that.

633
00:30:07,807 --> 00:30:10,518
(phone ringing)

634
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:15,875
[Voicemail] Your call
has been forwarded to

635
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,818
an automated voice
messaging system.

636
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,362
9165-9949

637
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,868
is not available.

638
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:29,829
At the tone, please
record your message.

639
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,081
When you finished recording,

640
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:33,625
you may hang up or press
one for more options.

641
00:30:34,918 --> 00:30:36,211
Hey, Sam.

642
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:38,672
Please call me back.

643
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:40,507
I didn't mean to
ask the question.

644
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,829
Ooh, it's a good
workout today.

645
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,372
Sure is.

646
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:15,667
Now we're on the letter
M for the pages of love.

647
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:19,462
You want a man that believes
in the ministry of Jesus.

648
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:22,382
You want a man that
believes in monogamy.

649
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,968
You want a man that
is marriage material.

650
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,053
You want a man that
will make you his wife,

651
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:29,848
and a man that is
madly in love with you.

652
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:32,017
And it won't hurt if he
can give a good massage.

653
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:33,393
Amen to that.

654
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:35,061
Now, for the letter N.

655
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:38,023
You want a noble,
non-judgemental man.

656
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:41,568
A man who can give you the
spiritual nourishment you need,

657
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:43,403
a man who will not neglect you,

658
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:45,613
and a man who will
give you nonstop love.

659
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:50,827
For the letter O, you want
an outgoing, outstanding man,

660
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:53,163
one who is overqualified
in every area

661
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:55,290
to provide, protect,
and support.

662
00:31:56,791 --> 00:31:58,418
Say that again. Amen.

663
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,586
Say that, girl.

664
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:06,426
Good morning, Jessica.

665
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:08,261
I made you some coffee.

666
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:09,512
[Jessica] Mmm.

667
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:10,906
I got more respect for
myself than to wake up

668
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,557
this early in the morning.

669
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,599
Goodnight.

670
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,103
You're not Michelle
Obama, so get up.

671
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,458
[Jessica] The only reason
why you're up in here

672
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:21,876
is because you don't
have a man in your bed.

673
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,127
And if you had a
man in your bed,

674
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:24,837
you wouldn't be up here
in my room talking to me

675
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:25,987
at the ass crack of dawn.

676
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,449
Well, I have a
date tonight anyway.

677
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:30,367
Goodbye.

678
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:31,993
[Jessica] Mmm,
have a good one.

679
00:32:34,996 --> 00:32:36,790
Come on up in here
talkin' about,

680
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:39,459
"Good morning. It's coffee."

681
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:41,002
Ass crack of dawn.

682
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:49,886
- Hi, are you Reggie?
- Yes, I am.

683
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:50,845
All right, nice to meet you.

684
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:52,430
Nice to meet you, too.

685
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:54,158
All right, tell me what you
like and what you don't like.

686
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:55,642
Well, I don't like to cook,

687
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:58,311
I don't like to clean, I
don't like to pay taxes,

688
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:01,523
and I don't like to
sign birth certificates.

689
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:03,024
Do you have children?

690
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,317
Not that I know of.

691
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,027
I don't sign birth certificates.

692
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:08,488
Please explain.

693
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,657
Well, as a man, if you
sign a birth certificate

694
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:12,992
and cut an umbilical cord,
you're technically a father,

695
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:14,744
so I don't do any of those.

696
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:16,162
What about you?

697
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:18,248
I don't like men who
don't pay child support.

698
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:21,376
I don't like liars and
I don't like cheaters.

699
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:24,379
Well, you don't like
me, so swipe left.

700
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:26,381
All right, swipin' left. Bye.

701
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:41,062
Hello, Mom. What you doing?

702
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:45,817
Not much. You wanna
go for some ice cream?

703
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:46,776
All right. Come on outside.

704
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:48,570
I'm parked out front.

705
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:49,611
All right, bye-bye.

706
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:57,954
- Hey.
- Hey.

707
00:33:57,996 --> 00:33:59,748
So how was your date?

708
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:01,916
Oh, awful.

709
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,210
This guy says he doesn't
pay child support

710
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:07,839
or sign his children's
birth certificates.

711
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:09,049
(Joan laughing)

712
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,551
Sorry, baby, but that's funny.

713
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:13,261
Baby, you deserve better.

714
00:34:13,303 --> 00:34:16,556
First you have to be fly, F-L-Y,

715
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,184
and that means
first love yourself.

716
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:22,103
And when you love yourself,
you won't be desperate.

717
00:34:22,145 --> 00:34:24,939
Okay, well, have you
ever been asked for a Dana?

718
00:34:24,981 --> 00:34:26,232
A Dana? What's that?

719
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,443
A DNA test.

720
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:31,905
Well, no, but he still
didn't take care of the kids.

721
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:33,406
The feeling is the same.

722
00:34:33,448 --> 00:34:35,825
And don't have a dream
between your legs.

723
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,869
Have it in your mind.

724
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:39,079
That's a good one.

725
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,414
Well, do you know that
he asked the judge

726
00:34:41,456 --> 00:34:44,459
for a retest on the DNA test?

727
00:34:44,501 --> 00:34:45,585
(Joan laughs)

728
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:47,170
You can't have a
retest on a DNA test.

729
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:49,756
This ain't no SATs
where you get a retest.

730
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:51,716
No, it's not. (laughs)

731
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:52,758
That's funny.

732
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:04,646
- Hi, are you Percy?
- Yeah.

733
00:35:04,688 --> 00:35:06,356
Hi.

734
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:07,607
Let's cut to the chit chat.

735
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:10,068
What are you looking
for in a relationship?

736
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,462
I'm not looking
for a relationship.

737
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:13,822
I'm looking for
relations. You feel me?

738
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:17,158
I hope you could relate to
that, 'cause I like open doors.

739
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,494
[Samantha] So do I. Bye.

740
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:25,125
(phone ringing)

741
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:27,144
[Voicemail] No one is
available to take your call.

742
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:29,129
Please leave a message.

743
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,715
Hey, Sam, please call me back.

744
00:35:31,756 --> 00:35:33,174
I miss talking to you.

745
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:35,885
I'm pretty sure you won't
find another man like me.

746
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:46,813
(knuckles rapping)

747
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:53,737
Hey.
[Samantha] Hi.

748
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:54,779
Here.

749
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:56,740
It's a peace offering.
Thank you.

750
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:58,992
But let's just forget
about it, okay?

751
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:00,160
Okay.

752
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:02,037
Well, come sit down
and relax with me then.

753
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:03,121
Okay.

754
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:05,915
Well, it is a
nice day for a fire.

755
00:36:05,957 --> 00:36:07,250
Yeah, the air
is crisp up here.

756
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:08,501
I'm a little bit cold.

757
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:10,128
Why don't you come
sit next to me?

758
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,170
Okay.

759
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:13,965
See? I don't bite.

760
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:16,509
Okay.

761
00:36:16,551 --> 00:36:19,179
I love this show, too.
(both laughing)

762
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,406
It's so good.
(knuckles rapping)

763
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:22,349
Who's that? Your girlfriend?

764
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,267
No, she's sitting
right next to me.

765
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:25,453
Well, let me get
my gun out there.

766
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:26,353
No, no, no, no. Wait.

767
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:27,729
You don't need that.

768
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:29,022
I'll protect you.

769
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:30,565
I won't let anything
happen to you.

770
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:33,360
The unexpected knock at
the door says I need this.

771
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:34,420
Okay, let me
just see who it is.

772
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:36,321
I'll take care of it.

773
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:38,823
Leave that in there!

774
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:39,865
It's okay.

775
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:43,536
(knuckles rapping)

776
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:44,597
Hey.
[Joan] Hey, Mariano.

777
00:36:44,621 --> 00:36:46,039
How you doing?
I'm good.

778
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:47,374
How you doing?
I'm fine.

779
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:49,185
I was in the neighborhood,
so I thought I'd drop by.

780
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:50,377
What y'all doing?

781
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:52,379
[Samantha] We
are not having sex.

782
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,131
You, I tell you, you
are something else.

783
00:36:55,173 --> 00:36:57,384
And Mariano, I really
can't by to invite you

784
00:36:57,425 --> 00:36:59,427
Saturday to come over
for drinks with us.

785
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:01,054
Two o'clock.
Oh, okay. I'd love to.

786
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:02,222
Definitely, sounds good.

787
00:37:02,263 --> 00:37:04,057
Okay. And you, you be good.

788
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:05,058
I love you, okay?

789
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,226
[Samantha] Love you, too.

790
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,662
- Okay, see y'all later.
- [Samantha] Bye.

791
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:09,080
I'll see you later, Joan.
I'll see you Saturday.

792
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:11,147
[Joan] Okay, bye.

793
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:12,750
You runnin' checkups
on me now or somethin'?

794
00:37:12,774 --> 00:37:13,942
Yes, I am.

795
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,419
Oh, well how you gonna
say it's my girlfriend

796
00:37:15,443 --> 00:37:17,237
when that was your mom?

797
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:19,406
- Well, it happens.
- Oh, Lord.

798
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:22,450
Let's get the fire started.

799
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:24,092
Let's just chill for
the rest of the day.

800
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:25,245
Okay.

801
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:26,079
Since the checkups are done.

802
00:37:26,121 --> 00:37:30,625
Yes. (chuckles)

803
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:37,590
(knuckles rapping)

804
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:43,179
Hi.
Hey.

805
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:44,222
Thanks for having me.

806
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:46,266
- Thanks for comin'.
- No problem.

807
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:48,268
Your mom's sweet, by the way.

808
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:49,227
How you doing, though?

809
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:50,145
Actually, not so good.

810
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,604
You know what?
What?

811
00:37:51,646 --> 00:37:53,773
Someone just hit my car
and I'm a Uber driver,

812
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:55,275
so I need my car to drive,

813
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:57,169
and they won't let you drive
with damage to your car.

814
00:37:57,193 --> 00:37:58,611
Wow. Yeah, I understand.

815
00:37:58,653 --> 00:37:59,797
Can I take a look at it, though?

816
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:01,156
- Sure.
- Come on.

817
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:02,299
It's the one in
the front, right?

818
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:03,658
[Samantha] Indeed it is.

819
00:38:09,748 --> 00:38:10,748
Ooh.

820
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,752
I'm sorry they hit you,

821
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:16,129
but I can get that
fixed for you.

822
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:17,172
[Samantha] Yeah, right.

823
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:18,548
Yeah, I can.

824
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,775
You wanna come spend the night?

825
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:21,801
I can go take it to the
shop in the morning.

826
00:38:23,094 --> 00:38:24,387
I won't hold my breath.

827
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,723
Okay.

828
00:38:26,765 --> 00:38:28,492
You can actually have the
whole top floor if you like,

829
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:30,310
if that makes you
feel more comfortable.

830
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:33,104
I feel just fine. I got a gun.

831
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:34,731
All right, then. My bad.

832
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,067
What happened, though?

833
00:38:37,108 --> 00:38:38,318
Some lady sideswiped me.

834
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,653
Mmm. Yeah, I hate those.

835
00:38:40,695 --> 00:38:42,298
You got her information
and everything, though?

836
00:38:42,322 --> 00:38:43,531
I did.

837
00:38:43,573 --> 00:38:45,617
Oh, yeah. That'll
be an easy fix then.

838
00:38:45,658 --> 00:38:46,618
All right.

839
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,328
Well, you ready to go inside?

840
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,871
- [Samantha] I am.
- Let's go.

841
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:50,914
Yeah, ready for drinks.

842
00:38:50,955 --> 00:38:52,332
[Crew] Don't
look at the camera.

843
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:53,416
There you go.

844
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,418
There you go. Drink.

845
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,419
There you go.

846
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:58,046
Are we gonna do a cheers?

847
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,341
Oh, Lord.

848
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:02,443
Indubitably. Cheer it up.

849
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:04,177
You wanna pour
some more in there?

850
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:05,637
Yeah, I'll take this one.

851
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,597
You trying to get more.
(Samantha laughing)

852
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,848
Oh. Oh.

853
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,600
Yeah, I think I'll have.

854
00:39:10,642 --> 00:39:11,309
Oh!

855
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:12,894
Top me off right here.

856
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:14,312
- Oh! Oh!
- Thank you.

857
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:17,357
Oh, everybody wants
a little bit more.

858
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,275
Now I gotta get
some of this stuff.

859
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:21,277
Oh, God, I done
spilled a lot of it.

860
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:22,421
- Spill everywhere.
- My bad.

861
00:39:22,445 --> 00:39:23,613
Do you have any spit cups?

862
00:39:23,655 --> 00:39:24,614
No, I don't have
any spit cups.

863
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:25,656
Oh!

864
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,035
(glasses clinking)

865
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:30,495
- [Joan] Salute.
- Ready?

866
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,455
It's okay to let me love you.

867
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:35,291
I get acute loneliness
when I'm not with you.

868
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,210
Sorry, but my
heart is guarded.

869
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:39,045
So how can I break through?

870
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:40,255
You can't.

871
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:42,048
So no man can never love you?

872
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,551
Well, God says He'll never
leave you nor forsake you.

873
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:46,219
Can you beat that?

874
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:47,387
No.

875
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:49,514
But maybe with God's
help, I can come close.

876
00:39:49,556 --> 00:39:54,561
And the way I live, my love
for you is unstoppable.

877
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:58,231
Okay, that sounds like
that came from a script.

878
00:39:58,273 --> 00:39:59,941
I mean, it was from a TV show.

879
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:00,734
Okay, you got me there.

880
00:40:00,775 --> 00:40:02,402
But it is true.

881
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:04,029
It's the way I feel about you.

882
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,655
I do have jingling love for you.

883
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:09,492
Okay.

884
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:10,994
Just, just, okay?

885
00:40:11,036 --> 00:40:12,680
What do you want me to
say to that besides okay?

886
00:40:12,704 --> 00:40:14,164
You took it from a movie.

887
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:15,540
Well, I mean it too, though.

888
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:17,459
It's come generally
from my heart,

889
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,794
from that movie to you.

890
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:22,255
No, it would've been original.

891
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:23,423
Okay.

892
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:24,525
Well, I'll make
something up original

893
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:27,344
when I'm a little
less tipsy, okay?

894
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:30,305
'Cause I was just
drinking with your mom.

895
00:40:30,347 --> 00:40:32,057
You had a good time, right?

896
00:40:32,098 --> 00:40:33,433
10-four.

897
00:40:33,475 --> 00:40:34,684
10-four. Okay.

898
00:40:35,685 --> 00:40:37,771
Did that happen? 10-four?

899
00:40:37,812 --> 00:40:38,812
10-four.

900
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:45,779
(phone ringing)

901
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,364
Hello?

902
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:49,366
[Mariano] Hello.
How are you, Joan?

903
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:51,534
I'm blessed. How are you?

904
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:54,120
[Mariano] I'm good.
Good to hear, too.

905
00:40:54,162 --> 00:40:56,706
Hey, can you please get your
daughter to spend the night?

906
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:58,458
I'm trying to get her car fixed

907
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,877
'cause I don't want her
to go home without a car.

908
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:03,546
Yes, you know, she carries
around a lot of baggage

909
00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:06,049
from her past relationships,

910
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:08,051
so you know, she is cautious.

911
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,969
[Mariano] I understand,

912
00:41:10,011 --> 00:41:11,846
and I will wait
for her to open up.

913
00:41:11,888 --> 00:41:12,681
Well, thanks.

914
00:41:12,722 --> 00:41:14,015
You guys make a great couple.

915
00:41:15,183 --> 00:41:16,869
[Mariano] A great gun
totin' couple, huh? (chuckles)

916
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:20,146
Well, you know
she loves her guns.

917
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:24,275
[Mariano] Yeah, that
she does, that she does.

918
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:25,527
Okay, I'll talk to her.

919
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,487
[Mariano] Okay.
Thank you, Joan.

920
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:28,780
You're welcome. Bye-Bye.

921
00:41:30,031 --> 00:41:31,533
[Mariano] Bye.

922
00:41:39,457 --> 00:41:41,126
Good morning, baby.

923
00:41:41,167 --> 00:41:42,502
Good morning. How are you?

924
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:44,462
- I'm fine.
- Okay.

925
00:41:44,504 --> 00:41:46,089
Got a surprise outside.

926
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,298
What? More bills?

927
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,634
No, but it can help
you pay some bills.

928
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:50,593
Okay, here we go.

929
00:41:50,635 --> 00:41:52,303
More Sesame Street games.

930
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:54,347
- Let's go see.
- Okay.

931
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:56,558
Let's go see Bert,
Ernie, and Elmo.

932
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,527
Wow.

933
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:10,113
Who fixed my car?
Mariano.

934
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:11,364
Well, where is he?

935
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:12,550
He dropped it off
early this morning.

936
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:13,908
He had to go to work.

937
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,202
Okay, well, I'll thank him
on my next date with him.

938
00:42:16,244 --> 00:42:17,287
Looks good, huh?

939
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:18,621
Yeah, it looks really good.

940
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:21,374
- Surprise!
- Surprise, surprise.

941
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:23,668
Nice bow.
Love it.

942
00:42:29,257 --> 00:42:32,594
(indistinct TV chatter)

943
00:42:33,386 --> 00:42:34,804
I'm glad you came, though.

944
00:42:34,846 --> 00:42:37,182
I was looking forward
to seeing you again.

945
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:38,224
Likewise.

946
00:42:38,266 --> 00:42:39,517
Thank you for fixing my car.

947
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:41,019
How much do I owe you?

948
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:42,437
Nothin'.

949
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:44,564
Just all the time I
spend with you is enough.

950
00:42:44,606 --> 00:42:47,275
I think I hear the
neighbor's dog barking.

951
00:42:47,317 --> 00:42:51,613
Okay, but how can I spend
more time with you, though?

952
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:53,114
I love animals.

953
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:56,242
I can tell by all the
dog T-shirts you got.

954
00:42:56,284 --> 00:42:58,495
What do you got?
Like 20 of them?

955
00:42:58,536 --> 00:42:59,621
17.

956
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:02,290
- The exact number.
- Yes.

957
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:03,416
Oh, Lord.

958
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,669
So what does make you happy?

959
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:09,089
- My dogs and my kids.
- Oh, wow.

960
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,216
That's a good answer.
You're a good mom.

961
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:12,300
Thank you.

962
00:43:12,342 --> 00:43:14,344
I really enjoy
spending time with you.

963
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:16,429
Let's get back to the show.

964
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:17,597
This is my favorite part.

965
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:22,727
(both laughing)
(indistinct TV chatter)

966
00:43:30,568 --> 00:43:33,738
(knuckles rapping)

967
00:43:40,537 --> 00:43:41,955
Hey.
[Samantha] Hi.

968
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:44,207
- You lookin' good.
- Thank you.

969
00:43:44,249 --> 00:43:45,041
Thank you.

970
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:46,084
These are for you.

971
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:47,627
Oh, thanks.

972
00:43:47,669 --> 00:43:48,628
Go put those on.

973
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,547
I'll see you when you get done.

974
00:43:50,588 --> 00:43:51,464
The bathroom's the
first door on the right.

975
00:43:51,506 --> 00:43:52,757
[Samantha] Okay. Thank you.

976
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:00,724
Please, come lay on the table.

977
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:02,225
[Samantha] This is different.

978
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:04,561
Well, I'm different from
anybody else you ever dated.

979
00:44:04,602 --> 00:44:05,621
[Samantha] So we're dating?

980
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:06,771
I think so.

981
00:44:08,815 --> 00:44:11,484
Come on, get on. I'll help you.

982
00:44:11,526 --> 00:44:15,572
Don't fall now.
(Samantha laughing)

983
00:44:15,613 --> 00:44:16,613
It's okay.

984
00:44:17,407 --> 00:44:19,325
I got two scents, actually.

985
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:20,367
I got lavender

986
00:44:21,536 --> 00:44:22,536
and

987
00:44:23,496 --> 00:44:24,456
vanilla.

988
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:25,457
Which one would you like?

989
00:44:25,498 --> 00:44:26,332
Vanilla, please.

990
00:44:26,374 --> 00:44:27,500
Ooh, good choice.

991
00:44:27,542 --> 00:44:29,002
This is will smell really good.

992
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:31,796
All right, so just relax.

993
00:44:32,547 --> 00:44:34,466
Let take all the tension away.

994
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:38,261
[Samantha] What
is this guy up to?

995
00:44:38,303 --> 00:44:40,055
No man does this type of stuff

996
00:44:40,096 --> 00:44:42,682
without wanting
something in return.

997
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:44,184
Jesus, is this real?

998
00:44:44,893 --> 00:44:48,021
(mellow pop music)

999
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,387
Okay.

1000
00:45:20,428 --> 00:45:21,721
I think we're all done here.

1001
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:24,557
I hope I relieved some of
the tension that you have.

1002
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:25,600
Oh, yes, you did.

1003
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:27,227
Thank you.
Definitely.

1004
00:45:27,268 --> 00:45:28,353
Thank you for coming.

1005
00:45:28,395 --> 00:45:29,705
Would you mind joining
me next weekend

1006
00:45:29,729 --> 00:45:31,773
at the farmer's market?
Yes.

1007
00:45:32,691 --> 00:45:33,775
Okay, cool.

1008
00:45:33,817 --> 00:45:35,276
Is there anything
else you wanna do?

1009
00:45:35,318 --> 00:45:37,088
We can go get something to
eat if you're still hungry.

1010
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:38,756
I'm always game
forgetting something to eat.

1011
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,906
Okay, cool.

1012
00:45:39,948 --> 00:45:41,634
There's a new place
actually across the way.

1013
00:45:41,658 --> 00:45:43,743
Wanna go check it out?
Yes.

1014
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:45,370
Okay, cool.

1015
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:47,622
Get you all lathered up.

1016
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:49,040
Hope you ain't too relaxed.

1017
00:45:49,082 --> 00:45:53,253
Don't fall off the thing now.
(Samantha laughs)

1018
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:59,300
(upbeat pop music)

1019
00:46:19,654 --> 00:46:20,780
Beautiful day.

1020
00:46:20,822 --> 00:46:23,616
We're gonna continue
with the pages of love.

1021
00:46:23,658 --> 00:46:25,952
We're on the letter S.

1022
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:29,622
You want a safe man
who can give security

1023
00:46:29,664 --> 00:46:32,625
and provide a stable,
safe environment.

1024
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:34,627
Now for the letter T,

1025
00:46:34,669 --> 00:46:37,130
you want a man who
is trustworthy,

1026
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:40,675
transparent, tender,
and thoughtful,

1027
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:43,720
and who wants you on his team.

1028
00:46:43,762 --> 00:46:46,264
I'll give you a bonus
with the letter T.

1029
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:49,184
Stay away from a
man who will put you

1030
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:51,644
through a tumultuous
relationship

1031
00:46:51,686 --> 00:46:55,774
with trials and tell you tales.

1032
00:46:55,815 --> 00:46:57,359
Now, the letter U.

1033
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,154
You want a man who loves
you unconditionally.

1034
00:47:01,196 --> 00:47:03,823
You want an understanding man.

1035
00:47:03,865 --> 00:47:06,743
You want a man who can
make a union with you

1036
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:10,914
as in marriage because
marriage is a union.

1037
00:47:10,955 --> 00:47:14,626
And lastly, you don't want
a man who's unemployed.

1038
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,178
(upbeat pop music)

1039
00:47:48,535 --> 00:47:50,870
I'm glad to see you
again. You look wonderful.

1040
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:51,913
Thank you.

1041
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:53,790
Temperature in here feels good.

1042
00:47:53,832 --> 00:47:54,958
Yeah.

1043
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,084
What's new with you?

1044
00:47:57,293 --> 00:47:58,771
Well, I'm trying to
buy this clothing store,

1045
00:47:58,795 --> 00:48:01,089
and the price went up $50,000.

1046
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:03,008
- 50,000?
- [Samantha] Mmm-hmm.

1047
00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:04,217
What? Where is that?

1048
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:07,554
In Sacramento at
4633 Auburn Boulevard.

1049
00:48:07,595 --> 00:48:09,848
Hmm. Auburn, huh?

1050
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:11,808
I'm gonna take a look at it.

1051
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:12,809
You hungry or anything?

1052
00:48:12,851 --> 00:48:14,894
You want anything to eat?
Yes.

1053
00:48:14,936 --> 00:48:16,896
- What you in the mood for?
- Chicken and waffles.

1054
00:48:16,938 --> 00:48:18,106
Okay, let's go.

1055
00:48:18,148 --> 00:48:20,650
You wanna order it to
go or you wanna go out?

1056
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:21,860
Why don't we order in?

1057
00:48:21,901 --> 00:48:24,237
Okay, okay, let's
get ready to go.

1058
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:25,113
Okay.

1059
00:48:25,155 --> 00:48:26,448
And then we can bring it back,

1060
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:27,925
start the movie, get some
popcorn ready for us.

1061
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:29,117
Let's go.
Okay.

1062
00:48:32,328 --> 00:48:35,081
(phone ringing)

1063
00:48:40,879 --> 00:48:41,838
[Samantha] Hello?

1064
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,024
Hey, Sam, can you meet me at

1065
00:48:43,048 --> 00:48:46,092
4633 Auborn Boulevard tomorrow?

1066
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:49,929
[Samantha] Sure,
yeah. What's up?

1067
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:50,889
I'm gonna be in the area.

1068
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:52,515
I got a surprise for you, too.

1069
00:48:53,975 --> 00:48:55,935
[Samantha] Mmm,
okay. See you there.

1070
00:48:55,977 --> 00:48:56,936
Okay, cool.

1071
00:48:56,978 --> 00:48:58,605
See you tomorrow.

1072
00:48:58,646 --> 00:48:59,749
[Samantha] All right. Bye-Bye.

1073
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:00,773
Bye.

1074
00:49:03,568 --> 00:49:05,445
[Crew] Auborn?

1075
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:06,654
[Crew] Auborn, yup.

1076
00:49:06,696 --> 00:49:08,740
All right, so give her a...

1077
00:49:14,788 --> 00:49:15,747
[Mariano] Hey.

1078
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:17,290
Hey, Mariano.

1079
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:19,292
- [Mariano] You made it.
- Yes. What's this?

1080
00:49:19,334 --> 00:49:20,960
I wanted to surprise you.

1081
00:49:21,002 --> 00:49:21,795
[Samantha] With what?

1082
00:49:21,836 --> 00:49:22,921
I bought you a store.

1083
00:49:22,962 --> 00:49:24,964
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1084
00:49:25,006 --> 00:49:26,424
How did you and when did you?

1085
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:27,943
Well, now you don't have
to drive Uber anymore.

1086
00:49:27,967 --> 00:49:31,054
So here, actually take a look.

1087
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:32,764
- Okay.
- Let's take a look inside.

1088
00:49:37,143 --> 00:49:39,187
Oh, you hear that?

1089
00:49:39,229 --> 00:49:41,648
- [Samantha] I do.
- Oh.

1090
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:42,607
[Samantha] Wow.

1091
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:43,942
[Mariano] What do you think?

1092
00:49:43,983 --> 00:49:46,069
[Samantha] This
looks so beautiful.

1093
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:47,338
[Mariano] I'm
glad you like it.

1094
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:50,115
[Samantha] I love it.
What a beautiful store.

1095
00:49:50,156 --> 00:49:51,991
[Mariano] I'm
glad you like it.

1096
00:49:52,033 --> 00:49:55,995
Oh, yes.

1097
00:49:56,037 --> 00:49:59,374
Wow. This is absolutely amazing.

1098
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:01,334
Thank you. I'm
glad you like it.

1099
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:02,627
I love it.

1100
00:50:02,669 --> 00:50:04,522
They got some cool little
stuff in here, right?

1101
00:50:04,546 --> 00:50:05,547
Yeah.

1102
00:50:05,588 --> 00:50:06,899
Now it's all a
little bit set up,

1103
00:50:06,923 --> 00:50:08,758
so now you can do
whatever you want to it.

1104
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,010
Thank you.

1105
00:50:10,051 --> 00:50:10,885
Look, they already
got some $5 jeans,

1106
00:50:10,927 --> 00:50:12,012
brand new, ready to go.

1107
00:50:12,053 --> 00:50:13,013
Right, right. Yeah.

1108
00:50:13,054 --> 00:50:14,347
They got everything here.

1109
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:16,016
Do they have any dog apparel?

1110
00:50:16,057 --> 00:50:18,018
Oh, I don't know.
We gotta look around.

1111
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:19,561
Oh, I think some over there.

1112
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:32,115
Hey, I wanted to say something.

1113
00:50:32,157 --> 00:50:35,827
A gentleman is someone who
brings more into the world

1114
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:37,162
than he takes out of it,

1115
00:50:37,912 --> 00:50:39,205
so I got you this.

1116
00:50:46,004 --> 00:50:48,256
- Wow. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1117
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:49,758
It says, "Handmade with love."

1118
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:51,051
And it is.

1119
00:50:51,092 --> 00:50:54,095
And this is a hundred
things I wanna do for you

1120
00:50:54,137 --> 00:50:55,430
because I care about you.

1121
00:50:57,015 --> 00:50:58,767
Let's open it up
and take a look.

1122
00:51:06,024 --> 00:51:08,443
This says you wanna
be my travel buddy.

1123
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:10,236
Yes. I want to
travel the world.

1124
00:51:10,278 --> 00:51:12,113
And I hope to do that with you.

1125
00:51:15,325 --> 00:51:17,869
This one says, "I'm your type."

1126
00:51:20,914 --> 00:51:23,166
"I wanna be your lover."

1127
00:51:23,958 --> 00:51:27,420
Oh.

1128
00:51:27,462 --> 00:51:30,090
This one says you want
to be my chauffeur.

1129
00:51:30,131 --> 00:51:32,759
Yeah, 'cause I can show
you around everywhere.

1130
00:51:32,801 --> 00:51:35,136
(Samantha chuckles)

1131
00:51:35,178 --> 00:51:38,473
And this one says, "I
wanna be your Santa Claus."

1132
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:39,515
Okay.

1133
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:42,411
You do gotta
make the nice list.

1134
00:51:42,435 --> 00:51:43,704
You can't be on
the naughty list.

1135
00:51:43,728 --> 00:51:46,564
This one says you
want to be my provider.

1136
00:51:46,606 --> 00:51:49,150
Yes, I can provide
anything you want.

1137
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:54,656
And this one says, "I want to be

1138
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:59,327
your massage therapist."

1139
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:00,495
Aww.

1140
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:02,956
I give the best
massages. You gotta wait.

1141
00:52:02,997 --> 00:52:04,249
Aww.

1142
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:06,334
This one here says you
want to be my bellhop.

1143
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:09,021
Yeah, that was a funny one.

1144
00:52:09,045 --> 00:52:10,964
I knew you'd like that one.

1145
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:12,007
(Samantha chuckles)

1146
00:52:12,048 --> 00:52:14,134
And "I wanna be
your biggest fan."

1147
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:15,301
Aww.

1148
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:21,141
This one here says you
want to be my TV buddy.

1149
00:52:21,182 --> 00:52:23,727
(chuckles) Because
I love my TV shows.

1150
00:52:23,768 --> 00:52:25,478
(Samantha chuckles)

1151
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,520
And this one

1152
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,234
says, "I want to be-

1153
00:52:31,276 --> 00:52:34,237
- You wanna be my
breakfast in bed buddy.

1154
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:36,156
(Mariano chuckles)

1155
00:52:36,197 --> 00:52:39,826
I cook a mean breakfast.
(Samantha chuckles)

1156
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:43,163
This one says you
want to be my anchor.

1157
00:52:43,204 --> 00:52:45,206
Yes, 'cause I
can hold you down.

1158
00:52:48,126 --> 00:52:52,589
And this one says, "I
wanna protect you."

1159
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:54,966
- Oh, thank you.
- From everything.

1160
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:57,344
So don't pull out
a gun on me now.

1161
00:52:57,385 --> 00:52:58,887
(Samantha laughs)

1162
00:52:58,928 --> 00:53:02,807
This one says you want
to be my forever partner.

1163
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:04,017
I do want to.

1164
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:06,478
And this one says,

1165
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:10,231
"I want to be the father
of your children."

1166
00:53:10,273 --> 00:53:12,233
Aw, thank you.

1167
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:23,203
What does your shirt say?

1168
00:53:23,244 --> 00:53:27,749
Oh, my shirt says, "Looking
for Mr. Right, swipe."

1169
00:53:27,791 --> 00:53:29,125
Oh, I like that.

1170
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:31,419
Speaking of looking
for Mr. Right,

1171
00:53:31,461 --> 00:53:33,338
we're gonna finish
the pages of love,

1172
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,716
and I wanna tell the ladies
on your YouTube channel.

1173
00:53:36,758 --> 00:53:38,235
Well, how are you
gonna share it with them

1174
00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:39,320
if you haven't shared
it with me first?

1175
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:41,221
Well, I'm getting ready to.

1176
00:53:41,262 --> 00:53:42,764
Ladies, for the pages of love,

1177
00:53:42,806 --> 00:53:45,016
we are on the letter V.

1178
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:46,226
For the letter V,

1179
00:53:46,267 --> 00:53:49,187
you want a man that has
values and a vision,

1180
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:52,232
a man that will
volunteer to help you.

1181
00:53:52,273 --> 00:53:55,443
You do not want a man that
will verbally abuse you

1182
00:53:55,485 --> 00:53:57,904
or leave a void in your life.

1183
00:53:57,946 --> 00:54:02,742
For the letter W, you want
a wonderful, working man,

1184
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:06,621
one that can worship with you
and one that will worship you.

1185
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:10,041
And lastly, ladies,
you do not want a man

1186
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,377
that is weak and whining.

1187
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:14,129
For the letter X,

1188
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,924
you want a man that
will XO XO all over you.

1189
00:54:17,966 --> 00:54:19,342
And when you x-ray his heart,

1190
00:54:19,384 --> 00:54:21,553
you'll find love for you there.

1191
00:54:21,594 --> 00:54:26,307
And lastly, ladies, you do
not want a man on Xanax.

1192
00:54:27,892 --> 00:54:29,144
I like that, ladies.

1193
00:54:29,185 --> 00:54:30,204
And one thing I
want to comment on

1194
00:54:30,228 --> 00:54:32,272
is she said, "Working man."

1195
00:54:32,313 --> 00:54:35,650
It's always good to have
a gainfully employed man.

1196
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:37,068
Yes it is.

1197
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,238
And as I said,
wonderful, working man,

1198
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:44,325
and we think any man that
workin' is wonderful.

1199
00:54:45,535 --> 00:54:46,828
That's it, ladies.

1200
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,872
Thank you, YouTube family.

1201
00:54:48,913 --> 00:54:50,373
Bye!
Bye!

1202
00:54:56,212 --> 00:54:58,465
God bless you.
Thank you for coming.

1203
00:54:58,506 --> 00:54:59,632
Thank you for inviting me.

1204
00:54:59,674 --> 00:55:00,759
No problem.

1205
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,320
You wanna do some
Bible study and prayer?

1206
00:55:02,344 --> 00:55:03,386
Absolutely.

1207
00:55:03,428 --> 00:55:04,530
You know I got the
Bible on my phone.

1208
00:55:04,554 --> 00:55:05,805
- I'm ready.
- Okay, okay.

1209
00:55:05,847 --> 00:55:06,991
You're getting a
little bougie on me.

1210
00:55:07,015 --> 00:55:08,850
Let me get my Bible up out, huh?

1211
00:55:09,976 --> 00:55:16,149
Okay, so since God is the
source of every blessing,

1212
00:55:16,191 --> 00:55:18,151
why don't we start
with Psalm 67:5?

1213
00:55:18,193 --> 00:55:19,069
Okay.

1214
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:20,270
Cool. Let me get that open.

1215
00:55:22,155 --> 00:55:23,323
Okay.

1216
00:55:23,365 --> 00:55:24,783
The word says,

1217
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,952
"The father unto the fatherless

1218
00:55:27,994 --> 00:55:33,166
and the protector of widows
is God in his holy dwelling."

1219
00:55:33,208 --> 00:55:34,208
Verse six.

1220
00:55:35,126 --> 00:55:37,545
"God sets the
lonely in families."

1221
00:55:37,587 --> 00:55:42,008
Sam, I want to be the
father of your children.

1222
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:43,050
I will protect you

1223
00:55:44,135 --> 00:55:46,137
and I will give you the
family that you desire.

1224
00:55:47,555 --> 00:55:49,557
Amen. That's the word of God.

1225
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:52,852
But why do you always
ignore the things

1226
00:55:52,894 --> 00:55:54,396
I try to do for you?

1227
00:55:54,437 --> 00:55:56,314
I'm not ignoring,
I'm just processing,

1228
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:59,317
because I see the lines or lies.

1229
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,360
I understand.

1230
00:56:00,402 --> 00:56:02,445
But I assure you, this is me.

1231
00:56:02,487 --> 00:56:04,948
This is my heart and I
wanna give it to you.

1232
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:07,242
Okay.

1233
00:56:07,283 --> 00:56:08,283
We'll see.

1234
00:56:09,244 --> 00:56:10,912
Okay, well, did
you enjoy the food?

1235
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:12,247
I did. Thank you.

1236
00:56:12,288 --> 00:56:13,391
I'm glad you really came out.

1237
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:14,934
I always have a
wonderful time with you.

1238
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:16,209
Likewise.

1239
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:17,395
You look amazing
today, by the way.

1240
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:18,336
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

1241
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:20,380
What you wanna do next week?

1242
00:56:20,422 --> 00:56:22,215
I wanna go for a
boat ride, please.

1243
00:56:22,257 --> 00:56:23,258
Oh.

1244
00:56:23,299 --> 00:56:25,176
Oh, you gettin'
real bougie on me.

1245
00:56:25,218 --> 00:56:26,428
I am.

1246
00:56:26,469 --> 00:56:28,388
I'll take you out on a
boat ride. That's fine.

1247
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:30,223
- Thank you.
- Can't wait to see you again.

1248
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:31,516
Likewise.

1249
00:56:38,231 --> 00:56:40,567
(indistinct TV chatter)

1250
00:56:40,608 --> 00:56:44,738
Hey, well tonight I thought
we should do a movie night.

1251
00:56:44,779 --> 00:56:47,365
Okay. I fall
asleep during movies.

1252
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:48,700
What? Why is that?

1253
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:50,452
I be so tired from workin'.

1254
00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:52,620
Okay.

1255
00:56:52,662 --> 00:56:55,373
But hopefully in the future
I can help with that.

1256
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:57,167
Hmm. So movie night, huh?

1257
00:56:57,208 --> 00:56:58,208
Yeah, hold on.

1258
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:00,327
I gotta get somethin' for you.

1259
00:57:03,214 --> 00:57:06,676
[Host] All right, Roger, you're
gonna vote for one couple.

1260
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:08,970
Okay, a round of applause.

1261
00:57:10,138 --> 00:57:13,391
(audience cheering)

1262
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:15,727
So you see, at this movie,

1263
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:20,065
all the snacks, all the popcorn,

1264
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:21,900
all the drinks are free.

1265
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:24,944
- Thank you.
- This one is for you.

1266
00:57:24,986 --> 00:57:26,613
This is so cute.

1267
00:57:28,406 --> 00:57:31,451
Mmm, popcorn need
a little bit of salt.

1268
00:57:31,493 --> 00:57:32,952
(Samantha laughs)

1269
00:57:32,994 --> 00:57:34,162
It's okay.

1270
00:57:34,204 --> 00:57:35,330
Top of the movie.

1271
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:37,499
[Samantha] Mmm-hmm.

1272
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,635
[Joan] Hey, how you doin'?

1273
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:50,136
Hey, what's going on?

1274
00:57:50,178 --> 00:57:52,597
Hey, I just came over to
finish our pages of love.

1275
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,683
You thought I
forgot, didn't you?

1276
00:57:54,724 --> 00:57:55,433
I did.

1277
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:56,685
Well, I did not forget.

1278
00:57:56,726 --> 00:58:00,605
And we are on the letter
Y for the pages of love.

1279
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:04,984
The letter Y, you want a man
that says yes to your request.

1280
00:58:05,026 --> 00:58:08,154
You want a man who yearns
for you in your absence.

1281
00:58:08,196 --> 00:58:12,534
And you want a man who can
yield a harvest for his family.

1282
00:58:12,575 --> 00:58:15,870
For the letter Z, you
want a man with zeal.

1283
00:58:15,912 --> 00:58:18,707
You want a man who
will zoom to help you.

1284
00:58:18,748 --> 00:58:21,626
You want a man who
can keep his zipper up

1285
00:58:21,668 --> 00:58:24,421
and who's not
zigzagging through life.

1286
00:58:24,462 --> 00:58:26,214
Now, when he zooms to help me,

1287
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:27,590
what kind of car will he be in?

1288
00:58:27,632 --> 00:58:30,385
It doesn't matter, as
long as he's zooming, okay?

1289
00:58:30,427 --> 00:58:32,220
To come to your rescue.

1290
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:33,221
That's what you want.

1291
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:34,973
Zeal and zooming.

1292
00:58:35,015 --> 00:58:38,518
And also, what I
wanna tell you last,

1293
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,353
you do not, and I repeat,

1294
00:58:40,395 --> 00:58:43,815
do not want a man
who's on Zoloft.

1295
00:58:43,857 --> 00:58:45,483
No.

1296
00:58:45,525 --> 00:58:48,361
And now I would like
to encourage you,

1297
00:58:48,403 --> 00:58:50,697
don't miss out on Mariano,

1298
00:58:50,739 --> 00:58:53,450
a good man, because
of your past.

1299
00:58:53,491 --> 00:58:55,535
Think of all the
dates you've had

1300
00:58:55,577 --> 00:58:58,038
and all the things
he's done for you.

1301
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:00,957
Nobody else has done
anything for you

1302
00:59:00,999 --> 00:59:04,711
except leave you pregnant
and left holding the bag,

1303
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:07,339
an empty bag with
no child support.

1304
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:12,677
So think back on how he cares
for you and respects you.

1305
00:59:15,013 --> 00:59:17,891
(upbeat pop music)

1306
01:00:57,198 --> 01:00:58,198
Sprinkles.

1307
01:00:59,909 --> 01:01:02,787
Samantha, baby, I got
something sweet for you.

1308
01:01:02,829 --> 01:01:04,497
Come in the kitchen.

1309
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:09,502
I'm comin'!

1310
01:01:09,544 --> 01:01:10,628
What you got?
Tada!

1311
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:12,839
Look. We gonna make
our own ice cream.

1312
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:14,341
Wow, I like this.

1313
01:01:14,382 --> 01:01:15,300
- You ready?
- Yes.

1314
01:01:15,342 --> 01:01:16,718
Okay, let's get started.

1315
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:20,472
Already prepared
everything for us.

1316
01:01:21,681 --> 01:01:23,350
So I got, before
the ice fall out.

1317
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:28,313
Got some bags of ice for us.

1318
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:29,689
Okay.

1319
01:01:29,731 --> 01:01:32,609
So we got some
strawberry vanilla extract

1320
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:34,319
and our heavy cream
and all that stuff.

1321
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:37,697
We got some gummy bears, some
sprinkles, chocolate sauce,

1322
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:38,615
some strawberry sauce.

1323
01:01:38,656 --> 01:01:40,575
And ready to get started?

1324
01:01:40,617 --> 01:01:42,035
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

1325
01:01:43,286 --> 01:01:46,289
We're gonna take this cup,
pour it in one of these.

1326
01:01:46,331 --> 01:01:47,331
Okay.

1327
01:01:54,631 --> 01:01:56,257
Ah, there we go.

1328
01:01:59,427 --> 01:02:00,762
Make sure I don't spill it.

1329
01:02:06,601 --> 01:02:07,894
Here we go.

1330
01:02:11,564 --> 01:02:12,732
Okay.

1331
01:02:12,774 --> 01:02:14,234
And close it up.

1332
01:02:20,448 --> 01:02:22,992
Drop it in the ice bag.

1333
01:02:23,034 --> 01:02:24,034
Okay.

1334
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:26,931
I don't know why you're
better at this than me.

1335
01:02:26,955 --> 01:02:28,415
I thought I planned it.

1336
01:02:28,456 --> 01:02:29,624
(Samantha giggles)

1337
01:02:29,666 --> 01:02:30,583
Is this supposed
to be our ice maker?

1338
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:31,960
Yes, that's the ice maker.

1339
01:02:32,002 --> 01:02:33,002
Okay.

1340
01:02:33,712 --> 01:02:34,963
Place it in there.

1341
01:02:36,172 --> 01:02:38,299
Close up the bag,
get the air out.

1342
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:41,803
Start shakin'.

1343
01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:44,723
Old school way, huh?

1344
01:02:44,764 --> 01:02:45,932
Old school.

1345
01:02:45,974 --> 01:02:48,309
I thought it would
be fun for us to do.

1346
01:02:48,351 --> 01:02:49,351
Okay.

1347
01:02:50,603 --> 01:02:51,771
Still going faster than me.

1348
01:02:51,813 --> 01:02:53,648
Thought I was plannin' this.

1349
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:55,191
(Samantha giggles)

1350
01:02:55,233 --> 01:02:58,278
Okay, get it all ready,
and start shakin'.

1351
01:02:58,319 --> 01:02:59,779
(ice rattling)

1352
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:02,824
(upbeat soul music)

1353
01:03:42,947 --> 01:03:45,158
I think that's ice cream now.

1354
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,076
Okay.

1355
01:03:46,117 --> 01:03:47,827
- Wanna check them out?
- Yeah.

1356
01:03:47,869 --> 01:03:48,869
All right.

1357
01:03:49,537 --> 01:03:50,537
How yours lookin'?

1358
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:53,667
Oh, yeah.

1359
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:54,668
Aw, yeah.

1360
01:03:54,709 --> 01:03:57,545
Oh, yeah. This is ice cream.

1361
01:03:57,587 --> 01:03:58,672
Ooh, looks good.

1362
01:03:58,713 --> 01:04:00,256
Got a good workout,
I guess, yeah.

1363
01:04:00,298 --> 01:04:02,342
- Got a good arm workout.
- Right.

1364
01:04:02,384 --> 01:04:04,177
You get tired from
that, too. Oof.

1365
01:04:06,012 --> 01:04:07,972
- Oh, look! Ice cream.
- Oh, right!

1366
01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:11,393
It came out so

1367
01:04:13,561 --> 01:04:14,479
good.

1368
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:15,772
Look at that!

1369
01:04:15,814 --> 01:04:16,856
Beautiful.

1370
01:04:16,898 --> 01:04:18,316
Homemade, too.

1371
01:04:22,237 --> 01:04:24,906
(spoon tapping)

1372
01:04:25,865 --> 01:04:28,118
I got some toppings
over there for you, too,

1373
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,120
if you wanna take
some sprinkles,

1374
01:04:30,161 --> 01:04:33,039
gummy bears or chocolate
sauce or anything.

1375
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:36,042
I think I'm gonna
take some sprinkles

1376
01:04:36,084 --> 01:04:37,502
and some gummy bears.

1377
01:04:37,544 --> 01:04:39,384
You remember that cartoon
called "Gummy Bears?"

1378
01:04:39,421 --> 01:04:40,422
Yeah, I do.

1379
01:04:41,923 --> 01:04:43,925
That one was a good one, though.

1380
01:04:45,343 --> 01:04:48,054
You want chocolate sauce
or strawberry, did you say?

1381
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:52,225
I will just take a little
splash of chocolate sauce.

1382
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:54,102
A little splash?
That's enough?

1383
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:56,771
- Yes, thank you.
- Okay, cool.

1384
01:04:56,813 --> 01:04:57,939
Cheers

1385
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:00,442
to the ice cream we made.

1386
01:05:01,109 --> 01:05:03,653
(Samantha giggles)

1387
01:05:03,695 --> 01:05:04,863
It's pretty good.

1388
01:05:04,904 --> 01:05:07,907
- Hmm, I like it.
- Mmm-hmm.

1389
01:05:07,949 --> 01:05:09,909
Make more homemade
ice cream after all.

1390
01:05:09,951 --> 01:05:12,412
Maybe not. It was a lot of work.

1391
01:05:12,454 --> 01:05:13,872
I don't know.

1392
01:05:13,913 --> 01:05:15,915
I don't know how they
did it in the old days.

1393
01:05:15,957 --> 01:05:18,084
This is actually
pretty good, though.

1394
01:05:20,503 --> 01:05:22,922
Thank you for spending
the time with me.

1395
01:05:22,964 --> 01:05:24,341
Thank you for inviting me.

1396
01:05:24,382 --> 01:05:25,508
Mmm-hmm.

1397
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:26,843
Any time.

1398
01:05:26,885 --> 01:05:28,446
You always have something
creative up your sleeve.

1399
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:29,929
I try. I try.

1400
01:05:29,971 --> 01:05:32,974
I'm trying to be
different, you know?

1401
01:05:34,934 --> 01:05:38,813
Can't be the same
as everybody else.

1402
01:05:38,855 --> 01:05:41,483
And this is actually hella good.

1403
01:05:42,901 --> 01:05:45,236
I'm surprised. It
came out really good.

1404
01:05:47,989 --> 01:05:49,115
Wanna come back next week?

1405
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:50,825
- [Samantha] Mmm-hmm.
- Same thing?

1406
01:05:50,867 --> 01:05:52,410
[Samantha] Mmm-hmm.

1407
01:05:52,452 --> 01:05:53,953
Are you hungry
or anything else?

1408
01:05:53,995 --> 01:05:54,871
Nope.

1409
01:05:54,913 --> 01:05:55,789
Or this dessert is fine.

1410
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:57,165
This is real good right here.

1411
01:05:57,207 --> 01:05:59,000
Real good.
Okay.

1412
01:06:03,963 --> 01:06:07,175
(mellow hip hop music)

1413
01:07:22,917 --> 01:07:26,087
(knuckles rapping)

1414
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:31,092
Hey.

1415
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:32,177
[Samantha] Hey.

1416
01:07:32,218 --> 01:07:33,053
You look fabulous as always.

1417
01:07:33,094 --> 01:07:34,054
Thank you.

1418
01:07:34,095 --> 01:07:35,388
Thank you for coming.

1419
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:37,140
Come join me at
the dinner table.

1420
01:07:37,182 --> 01:07:38,558
Let me pull out your chair.

1421
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,642
No, I got it.

1422
01:07:39,684 --> 01:07:40,894
Let me handle it for you.

1423
01:07:40,935 --> 01:07:42,103
Okay.

1424
01:07:42,979 --> 01:07:44,606
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

1425
01:07:44,647 --> 01:07:45,940
No problem.

1426
01:07:45,982 --> 01:07:47,960
I made us a little bit of
fish and some salad today.

1427
01:07:47,984 --> 01:07:50,111
- Okay.
- I hope you enjoy it.

1428
01:07:53,448 --> 01:07:56,159
- Tastes great.
- [Mariano] Thank you.

1429
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:57,369
So how was your day?

1430
01:07:58,787 --> 01:08:00,372
- Pretty good.
- That's good.

1431
01:08:01,373 --> 01:08:03,291
I do have an important
question to ask you.

1432
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,088
I do want to be your rock.

1433
01:08:08,129 --> 01:08:10,048
I wanna be your foundation.

1434
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:12,092
I wanna protect you, love you.

1435
01:08:12,133 --> 01:08:14,219
I want your kids. I want you.

1436
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,428
I want your problems.

1437
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:20,141
Will you answer
me this one thing?

1438
01:08:23,019 --> 01:08:24,019
Oh, my.

1439
01:08:28,483 --> 01:08:30,068
[Mariano] Will you marry me?

1440
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:31,611
Am I being punked?

1441
01:08:31,653 --> 01:08:32,779
No, of course not.

1442
01:08:32,821 --> 01:08:33,988
Why would you be punked?

1443
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:35,824
But you're gonna punk
me if you say no.

1444
01:08:37,117 --> 01:08:38,618
Yes, yes!

1445
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:40,328
Oh my gosh, yes!

1446
01:08:41,329 --> 01:08:43,665
[Mariano] Let
me see your hand.

1447
01:08:43,707 --> 01:08:44,707
Oh.

1448
01:08:45,583 --> 01:08:46,876
Fits just right.

1449
01:08:49,045 --> 01:08:50,213
Thank you so much.

1450
01:08:50,964 --> 01:08:52,757
[Mariano] Appreciate you.

1451
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:53,717
Thank you.

1452
01:08:53,758 --> 01:08:55,010
[Mariano] Love you so much.

1453
01:08:55,051 --> 01:08:56,177
I love you, too.

1454
01:08:57,971 --> 01:08:59,472
Let's finish our food.

1455
01:08:59,514 --> 01:09:01,683
Before we smell
like too much fish.

1456
01:09:02,809 --> 01:09:05,770
(soft upbeat music)

1457
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:16,489
(soft gentle music)

1458
01:09:49,898 --> 01:09:54,361
[Samantha] Moral of the
story is believe in love,

1459
01:09:54,402 --> 01:09:58,615
and the fairy tale love
that you want is out there.

1460
01:09:58,656 --> 01:10:02,535
Love found me and it
will find you, too.

1461
01:10:03,536 --> 01:10:07,248
Embrace that true,
authentic love.

1462
01:10:08,124 --> 01:10:12,128
He who finds a wife
finds a good thing

1463
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:13,755
and receives favor.

1464
01:10:15,048 --> 01:10:18,009
(soft gentle music)

1465
01:10:32,982 --> 01:10:35,902
(upbeat pop music)
