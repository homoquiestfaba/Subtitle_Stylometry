00:11:38,051 --> 00:11:39,636
- And?

178
00:11:39,677 --> 00:11:41,679
- [Kassi] I'll promise I'll have
the money for you next week.

179
00:11:41,721 --> 00:11:43,097
- You're not listening to me.

180
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:44,682
Get your shit out of my
apartment.

181
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:45,975
That works better for me at
this time.

182
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:47,060
- No, but I--

183
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:48,686
- Kassi, Kassi.

184
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:51,231
Your problem and your situation
doesn't concern me anymore.

185
00:11:51,272 --> 00:11:52,482
- No, I promise-

186
00:11:52,523 --> 00:11:54,025
- You're not listening,
I'm evicting you,

187
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:56,444
unless you got my money by
the end of this weekend.

188
00:11:56,486 --> 00:11:58,279
This is the deal, Sweetheart.

189
00:11:58,321 --> 00:12:01,741
Don't call me back unless
you got my money. Goodbye.

190
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:05,870
- Fuck.

191
00:12:05,912 --> 00:12:07,956
- Yeah. I'm not too
thrilled about it either.

192
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:09,666
- Well, I could just drive

193
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:11,376
me and my homegirl up there
myself.

194
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:12,377
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

195
00:12:12,418 --> 00:12:14,087
- Yeah, yeah. No.

196
00:12:14,128 --> 00:12:18,508
Sasha doesn't want more than
one car driving up there.

197
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:20,593
- All right, then. It is what
it is.

198
00:12:20,635 --> 00:12:23,221
- We don't have time for this
shit.

199
00:12:23,263 --> 00:12:26,182
Bus leaves in 10 minutes,
kiddos. Then I'm out.

200
00:12:29,018 --> 00:12:30,353
- She's nice.

201
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:32,313
- No, I'm a bitch.

202
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:37,026
And you're more than welcome,
not to come. 10 minutes.

203
00:12:38,945 --> 00:12:40,530
- What's up her ass?

204
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:44,367
- Girl. I don't know, and I
don't care.

205
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:48,621
Well, honestly. I made her
think that I fucked her man.

206
00:12:48,663 --> 00:12:49,956
(laughing)

207
00:12:49,998 --> 00:12:52,875
- Well, that's gonna be a fun
ride. Enjoy.

208
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,544
- Girl, we're gonna have so
much fun.

209
00:12:54,585 --> 00:12:56,629
- We?
- Yes girl.

210
00:12:56,671 --> 00:12:58,464
You said you needed a job,
right?

211
00:12:58,506 --> 00:12:59,716
- Yeah, but I-

212
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:01,592
- Well, your bestie looked out.

213
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:05,138
And I got you one with a bonus,
a free trip to No Cal, so.

214
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:06,848
Get your little bag, let's go.

215
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:09,350
- I don't know. I can't
just get up and go.

216
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:11,019
I might get an audition or a-

217
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,229
- Kas, Kas, you're not gonna
let me

218
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:14,564
ride along with that bitch by
myself.

219
00:13:14,605 --> 00:13:16,399
- Doesn't seem like she wants
me there.

220
00:13:16,441 --> 00:13:18,568
- That's what my bestie's
coming with me.

221
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:21,446
And what are best friends for?

222

Take your finger off the
button. Dumb ass.

236
00:14:04,781 --> 00:14:06,157
- Hold on.

237
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:08,242
You can talk to me any
kind of what you want to,

238
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:09,827
'cause you know
I don't give a fuck.

239
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:12,330
But you better watch the
way you talk to my girl.

240
00:14:13,748 --> 00:14:15,166
Okay?

241
00:14:16,876 --> 00:14:18,544
- What is that smell?

242
00:14:18,586 --> 00:14:20,129
- These are the killing fields.

243
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:22,924
It's super up fucked up
what they do to them, too.

244
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:24,842
They have them all huddled
together,

245
00:14:24,884 --> 00:14:27,011
trapped until they murder them.

246
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:29,305
- They milk them here too, you
know.

247
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:30,515
- So sad.

248
00:14:30,556 --> 00:14:31,808
- If you can't handle that,
city girl,

249
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:34,310
how are you supposed
to make it on the farm?

250
00:14:34,352 --> 00:14:36,521
- I can't kill animals,
no matter how much they-

251
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:38,773
- Girl, you're not about
to be killing no animals.

252
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:40,525
She's just being a bitch.

253
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:42,026
- Takes one to know one.

254
00:14:42,068 --> 00:14:44,654
- Anyways, why are we
going up to this farm?

255
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:46,072
And what do they farm there?

256
00:14:46,114 --> 00:14:49,242
- You really didn't tell
her anything, did you?

257
00:14:49,283 --> 00:14:50,618
This is California.

258
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,871
What do you think we'll be
farming?

259
00:14:55,164 --> 00:14:56,457
- Pot.

260
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:58,543
I don't know the first
thing about that stuff.

261
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:00,169
I barely smoke it.

262
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:02,672
- It doesn't matter if you even
smoke it.

263
00:15:02,713 --> 00:15:05,842
It's just basic watering,
and taking off dead leaves.

264
00:15:05,883 --> 00:15:07,593
Bullshit like that.

265
00:15:07,635 --> 00:15:09,595
The grower does the rest

266
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:12,598
- The grower?
- Yes, girl. Sasha.

267
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:16,519
- He's my boyfriend.

268
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:18,271
- Girl, he's cool as fuck.

269
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:21,107
He's smart.

270
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:22,316
- Fuck!

271
00:15:22,358 --> 00:15:24,569
- Sophisticated.

272
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,529
And so much fun to be around.

273
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:28,781
(slaps landing)

274
00:15:28,823 --> 00:15:32,118
We've only kicked it a few
times.

275
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,038
But like I said girl,
he's cool as fuck.

276
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,125
- Okay. That's far enough.

277
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:40,668
You think he likes you?

278
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,004
He just uses you for an extra
hand.

279
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:49,218
Keep playing. Let's
see where that gets ya.

280
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,309
(calm music)

281
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:04,108
(cell phone ringing)

282
00:16:12,658 --> 00:16:14,994
- [Dima] Sasha, Sasha, Sasha.

283
00:16:15,036 --> 00:16:16,329
- Hello?

284
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,457
- What were the terms of deal
we discuss?

285
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:20,708
- Terms?

286
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,419
- Yes, Sasha. The terms.

287
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:25,880
I finance your little
operation, and you provide me

288
00:16:25,922 --> 00:16:29,258
with the amount of product
that you promised to me.

289
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,385
Those were the terms, Sasha.

290
00:16:31,427 --> 00:16:34,305
Tell me. Have you been
trying to avoid me, Sasha?

291
00:16:34,347 --> 00:16:36,766
You haven't answered.

292
00:16:36,807 --> 00:16:38,476
- How about this?

293
00:16:38,518 --> 00:16:42,313
I got some beautiful girls
coming up here.

294
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:43,940
I can give them to you,

295
00:16:43,981 --> 00:16:46,734
just like the last ones for
your business.

296
00:16:46,776 --> 00:16:47,902
- [Dima] No.

297
00:16:47,944 --> 00:16:49,904
- These girls are really
gorgeous.

298
00:16:49,946 --> 00:16:53,741
You didn't make good on your
end of deal.

299
00:16:53,783 --> 00:16:57,537
So now I make good on my
promise to you.

300
00:16:57,578 --> 00:16:59,205
Goodbye, Sasha.

301
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:00,331
- Dima.

302
00:17:00,373 --> 00:17:03,125
(dramatic music)

303
00:17:04,835 --> 00:17:06,379
- You want us to take care of
him?

304
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,591
- No. Send that two face
boy. He owe us favor.

305
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:12,218
- I'll let him know.

306
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,595
- Thank you, Yury.

307
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:16,180
Yury?

308
00:17:16,222 --> 00:17:18,558
You tell him they have girls.

309
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,186
He brings back to me alive,
okay?

310
00:17:22,228 --> 00:17:24,021
- Understood.

311
00:17:25,064 --> 00:17:27,817
(dramatic music)

312
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:39,829
- Since I know this priss won't
do it,

313
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:43,499
you're pumping, free ride.

314
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:48,379
- Hey, I need to call my mom
while there's service,

315
00:17:48,421 --> 00:17:50,548
tell her I'll be gone a few
days.

316
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,217
- Go ahead, girl. I'll pump.

317
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:55,761
It would really rile that
bitch up to be wrong.

318
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:08,024
(cell phone ringing)

319
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:09,442
- Hello?

320
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:10,610
- [Kassi] Hi.

321
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:12,486
- Kassi?
- How are you?

322
00:18:12,528 --> 00:18:14,780
- I don't know how I manage,
but I do.

323
00:18:14,822 --> 00:18:17,366
Hey, have you talked to your
manager?

324
00:18:17,408 --> 00:18:19,577
- No, I haven't talked to my
manager yet.

325
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:21,037
- I have no faith in him.

326
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:22,580
I think we should leave him,

327
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:25,499
and talk about you moving back
home.

328
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,043
- No, I'm staying.

329
00:18:27,084 --> 00:18:30,755
- Kas, sometimes you have to
give up,

330
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:32,214
and say enough's enough.

331
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:33,924
- No, I can do this.

332
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:35,968
- [Mother] Kas, you aren't
getting any younger.

333
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,470
- Please, don't be like-

334
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:40,848
- I just, I want to do
what's best for my daughter.

335
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,391
And I feel I should tell her-

336
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:44,935
- I'm headed up North for a few
days.

337
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:47,521
- For what? To run off and
screw around?

338
00:18:47,563 --> 00:18:49,273
- No, I'm not off screwing
around.

339
00:18:49,315 --> 00:18:50,816
I'm going to make some money.

340
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:53,903
- Who am I to tell you not
to? I'm only your mother.

341
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:57,698
The lady who gave you
life and shelter, and-

342
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,492
- I promise I'll call
you when I get service.

343
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:01,285
- When you get service?

344
00:19:01,327 --> 00:19:03,162
This makes me very
uncomfortable, Kassi.

345
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:04,622
You don't want me going crazy.

346
00:19:04,664 --> 00:19:05,873
- Okay.

347
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:07,333
- [Mother] Call me in a few
hours.

348
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:11,379
- Bye.
- Bye.

349
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,839
(calm music)

350
00:19:18,386 --> 00:19:19,970
- Ever since reading that book

351
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:22,932
I took from that crazy lady,
Velma,

352
00:19:22,973 --> 00:19:25,601
it seems that the evil on this
mountain,

353
00:19:25,643 --> 00:19:30,940
and the disappearances,
date back to the 1800s.

354
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:34,652
A lady named Eve was sent
here by the Catholic church

355
00:19:34,694 --> 00:19:36,445
to investigate the
disappearances,

356
00:19:36,487 --> 00:19:38,572
because of course they knew.

357
00:19:38,614 --> 00:19:41,992
Men, both young and old,
suddenly began disappearing.

358
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:45,579
- I don't know, Eve.

359
00:19:45,621 --> 00:19:48,582
I don't know if I'll ever
find my Paul and William.

360
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:51,544
- You mustn't be afraid of
that, Mary.

361
00:19:51,585 --> 00:19:53,754
We have to be strong.

362
00:19:53,796 --> 00:19:56,465
We have to stop this.

363
00:19:56,507 --> 00:19:58,592
Are you ready to serve with us,
Mary?

364
00:19:59,677 --> 00:20:02,388
- And she tracked her.

365
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:04,932
And she found them.

366
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:09,478
- So, can you show me around
these hills?

367
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,896
I do know all these parts.

368
00:20:10,938 --> 00:20:13,065
- All the parts?

369
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:14,233
- I don't think we should go
any further.

370
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:15,776
People have been disappearing.

371
00:20:18,028 --> 00:20:20,823
- If you want me, we need to go
to a place

372
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:22,491
where we can be completely
alone.

373
00:20:25,911 --> 00:20:28,998
(suspenseful music)

374
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,501
- Evil takes forms you
would never expect, Mary.

375
00:20:32,543 --> 00:20:34,670
(door slams)

376
00:20:34,712 --> 00:20:37,298
- Eve, I saw the one you spoke
about

377
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:39,550
She's leading Thomas into the
forest.

378
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:41,010
What do we do?

379
00:20:41,051 --> 00:20:43,387
- We must go now, girls.

380
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:46,891
We are protected by the power
of God.

381
00:20:46,932 --> 00:20:50,060
And we will strike this
evil with his mighty sword.

382
00:20:55,149 --> 00:20:56,317
We're going to need it.

383
00:20:57,485 --> 00:21:00,654
(ritualistic singing)

384
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:25,012
(dramatic music)

385
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,436
- (grunting)
- (Mary squeals)

386
00:21:32,478 --> 00:21:33,604
Quiet, Mary.

387
00:21:33,646 --> 00:21:34,897
We mustn't let anything stop us.

388
00:21:34,939 --> 00:21:37,066
This is God's work
we're doing now.

389
00:21:37,107 --> 00:21:42,071
- (dramatic music)
- (ritualistic singing)

390
00:21:51,455 --> 00:21:53,707
(grunting)

391
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:58,587
Quickly, Mary. The knife.

392
00:21:58,629 --> 00:22:01,715
- (dramatic music)
- (ritualistic singing)

393
00:22:01,757 --> 00:22:06,762
- (grunting)
- (ritualistic singing)

394
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:16,772
(dramatic music)

395
00:22:22,403 --> 00:22:25,781
- Lady Eve's failed attempt
is the only known effort

396
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:27,616
to find and annihilate the evil

397
00:22:27,658 --> 00:22:29,994
that is known
to wander these woods.

398
00:22:31,954 --> 00:22:36,876
It's said that no mortal man,
with arms, can destroy it.

399
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:42,756
But a knife blessed with
the blood of a virgin woman

400
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:44,675
has the power to save
a man's soul,

401
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:48,596
or destroy the evil altogether.

402
00:22:59,148 --> 00:23:02,151
Ladies. Ladies, ladies.

403
00:23:03,986 --> 00:23:09,158
Welcome to Chateau Sasha.

404
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:14,204
Chris, you didn't introduce me
to your friend, spunky girl.

405
00:23:15,623 --> 00:23:18,459
- Oh yeah. Sash, this is Kas.

406
00:23:20,002 --> 00:23:21,003
- Pleasure.

407
00:23:23,631 --> 00:23:25,132
Let me show you to your rooms.

408
00:23:29,762 --> 00:23:31,180
Marissa.

409
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:34,016
You'll be in here, my love.

410
00:23:40,105 --> 00:23:41,440
Well, she's pleasant.

411
00:23:44,526 --> 00:23:47,237
All right, ladies, down here.

412
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,449
Kassi, you're gonna be
right here, darling.

413
00:23:53,077 --> 00:23:54,078
And Christiana,

414
00:23:55,913 --> 00:23:57,539
I'm gonna have you right in
here.

415
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:02,044
- No, girl. He got his own.

416
00:24:37,997 --> 00:24:42,668
(door squeaks then slams shut)

417
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,713
(suspenseful music)

418
00:24:57,599 --> 00:24:59,977
- Be downstairs in five minutes,

419
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:01,895
ready to go to the green house.

420
00:25:01,937 --> 00:25:05,566
(dogs howling and whining)

421
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:14,616
- Great.

422
00:25:17,494 --> 00:25:19,246
- Watch your step when
you're walking through here.

423
00:25:19,288 --> 00:25:24,710
There's holes, and glass, and
snakes,

424
00:25:24,752 --> 00:25:28,213
and other things not too
good for your health.

425
00:25:28,255 --> 00:25:30,299
- Of course, there's no phone
service.

426
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,051
Anything else we need to know
about?

427
00:25:32,092 --> 00:25:33,927
- Just werewolves and aliens.

428
00:25:38,432 --> 00:25:42,436
Your job is so easy,

429
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:43,562
monkeys can do it.

430
00:25:45,522 --> 00:25:50,527
I mix the nutrients, and
you water each plant.

431
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:57,785
If you mess up, or one of the
plants die,

432
00:25:59,828 --> 00:26:01,246
I will bury you on the property,

433
00:26:01,288 --> 00:26:03,207
never to be heard from again.

434
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:06,543
Are we understood?

435
00:26:08,754 --> 00:26:09,755
All right, then.

436
00:26:19,181 --> 00:26:20,474
- Girl, he's just playing.

437
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,482
- What the fuck is going on?

438
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:30,734
What'd you get me into?

439
00:26:30,776 --> 00:26:32,402
- Sucks.

440
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:33,904
There's no services in here.

441
00:26:33,946 --> 00:26:37,407
And Sasha gets all conspiracy
when it comes to wifi.

442
00:26:37,449 --> 00:26:39,368
- Hello? I'm freaking out.

443
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:42,287
This weirdo want-to-be
pimp, and his crazy ho.

444
00:26:42,329 --> 00:26:45,040
Plus we're stuck in the
middle of nowhere with them.

445
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:47,543
- Look, girl. They're just
different.

446
00:26:47,584 --> 00:26:49,253
But they're cool.

447
00:26:49,294 --> 00:26:51,755
I don't like everyone I
work with, but it's a job.

448
00:26:51,797 --> 00:26:55,175
Plus, this job pays 500 a day,

449
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:57,427
more than enough to pay your
water bill,

450
00:26:57,469 --> 00:27:00,097
and to get those head shots you
wanted.

451
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:03,392
So can you get it together?
It's time for dinner.

452
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:05,936
(gypsy music)

453
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,579
- Well, someone's got
a bit of an attitude.

454
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,248
- Would help if the bitch
wasn't sitting across from me.

455
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:29,710
- I will not tolerate that
kind of language at my table.

456
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:33,255
- So now I'm the bitch.
Fuck it, you can have him.

457
00:27:33,297 --> 00:27:37,759
- Well, at least if we fuck,
her attitude might be worth it.

458
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:38,886
- That's it.

459
00:27:38,927 --> 00:27:40,554
- None of this!

460
00:27:40,596 --> 00:27:44,308
Out of my face with this.

461
00:27:48,645 --> 00:27:50,480
- Honestly, I-
- Stop it!

462
00:27:51,857 --> 00:27:55,569
Now I made an amazing meal.

463
00:27:55,611 --> 00:27:59,740
And all you girls can do
is poop on my appetite.

464
00:27:59,781 --> 00:28:03,327
It's like, everybody is out to
fuck Sasha.

465
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:11,168
(gypsy music)

466
00:28:20,135 --> 00:28:21,887
- She should have called.

467
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:23,680
I told her to call.

468
00:28:23,722 --> 00:28:26,433
- She's gonna call. She always
calls.

469
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:28,060
- Do you think I'm overreacting?

470
00:28:30,896 --> 00:28:31,897
- A little bit.

471
00:28:34,316 --> 00:28:36,235
- Okay. Fine.

472
00:28:36,276 --> 00:28:40,072
(chattering from television)

473
00:28:46,453 --> 00:28:49,289
What are you watching?

474
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:51,833
- Some murder mountain
shit about Humboldt County.

475
00:29:00,342 --> 00:29:02,386
- Kas? Where are you gonna go?

476
00:29:02,427 --> 00:29:04,221
It's not like there's Uber out
here.

477
00:29:05,764 --> 00:29:07,224
- I thought I had problems.

478
00:29:07,266 --> 00:29:09,226
I'd rather be sitting
in my crappy apartment,

479
00:29:09,268 --> 00:29:10,602
with no water and in the dark,

480
00:29:10,644 --> 00:29:12,062
then be caught up in this shit.

481
00:29:12,104 --> 00:29:15,565
- Calm down. Put your bag down.

482
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:16,858
Kas.

483
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,987
(suspenseful music)

484
00:29:22,197 --> 00:29:24,366
(sobbing)

485
00:29:29,204 --> 00:29:32,207
(suspenseful music)

486
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:48,932
(dramatic music)

487
00:29:51,268 --> 00:29:52,978
- You sure this is the spot,
man?

488
00:29:54,146 --> 00:29:56,064
- Yeah, this is the place.

489
00:29:56,106 --> 00:29:57,899
Okay, let's do like we planned.

490
00:29:59,901 --> 00:30:01,486
- Everything's gonna be okay.

491
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:04,197
Okay?

492
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:07,242
(suspenseful music)

493
00:30:25,969 --> 00:30:26,970
- Okay.

494
00:30:29,097 --> 00:30:30,223
I'll stay.

495
00:30:30,265 --> 00:30:31,391
- Like you had a choice.

496
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:33,268
Friends for life.

497
00:30:34,561 --> 00:30:37,564
(suspenseful music)

498
00:31:10,347 --> 00:31:11,765
(distant rattling)

499
00:31:11,807 --> 00:31:16,144
- (gagging)
- (monster roaring)

500
00:31:16,186 --> 00:31:18,522
- What the hell was that?

501
00:31:18,563 --> 00:31:20,148
- I think it came from
downstairs.

502
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,193
(suspenseful music)

503
00:31:34,871 --> 00:31:37,040
(sobbing)

504
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,215
What the fuck did you do?

505
00:31:45,257 --> 00:31:48,718
- I didn't do it. I found him
like this.

506
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,886
- I told you that we slept
together,

507
00:31:49,928 --> 00:31:52,597
but I didn't know you was gonna
kill.

508
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:54,599
This is too much.
- I didn't do it.

509
00:31:56,643 --> 00:31:57,602
I didn't.

510
00:31:57,644 --> 00:32:00,605
(rattling across the ceiling)

511
00:32:00,647 --> 00:32:02,691
It's probably what's making
all that noise upstairs.

512
00:32:02,732 --> 00:32:04,443
- There's not time for this.
There's somebody in the house.

513
00:32:04,484 --> 00:32:05,861
- She's right. We're spending
too much time with this.

514
00:32:05,902 --> 00:32:08,280
We should be figuring a way out
of here.

515
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:09,948
- Let's get the fuck out of
here.

516
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:12,993
(suspenseful music)

517
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,932
(dramatic music)

518
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:56,119
Open the door! Open the door.

519
00:32:56,161 --> 00:32:57,871
- I forgot the fucking keys.

520
00:32:57,913 --> 00:32:58,955
- We have to run.

521
00:32:58,997 --> 00:33:02,000
(suspenseful music)

522
00:33:30,946 --> 00:33:33,865
Go. I've got a cramp.

523
00:33:33,907 --> 00:33:36,618
Go on. Why are you still
here? You killed Sasha.

524
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,163
- I did not kill Sasha. I loved
him.

525
00:33:40,205 --> 00:33:41,373
How do I know you didn't do it?

526
00:33:41,414 --> 00:33:43,500
- What?
- No, no, no. She was with me.

527
00:33:43,542 --> 00:33:44,668
- I was with Kassi.

528
00:33:44,709 --> 00:33:46,878
- Well, it wasn't me.

529
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,839
It had to be someone else.

530
00:33:49,881 --> 00:33:51,466
- Look, we can't just stand
here.

531
00:33:51,508 --> 00:33:53,051
- I don't know what to tell
you, but

532
00:33:53,093 --> 00:33:55,303
I'm not running around in
the dark with this bitch, so.

533
00:33:55,345 --> 00:33:56,721
- [Kassi] Chris, come on. Let's
go.

534
00:33:56,763 --> 00:33:58,348
- Come on.
- Let's go.

535
00:34:01,142 --> 00:34:04,020
- [Mother] None of my calls
or messages are going through.

536
00:34:04,062 --> 00:34:05,647
She's gotta be up there.

537
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:07,857
- Would you take it down a
notch?

538
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,152
- Up there could be anywhere.

539
00:34:11,194 --> 00:34:13,947
Shit, there's places in LA
I don't even get service.

540
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:17,284
- She said she's going up
North to make some money.

541
00:34:17,325 --> 00:34:20,078
It's pretty obvious where she
went.

542
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:22,122
- Yeah well, there's a
lot of places up North.

543
00:34:22,163 --> 00:34:24,291
San Francisco's up North,
Sacramento.

544
00:34:24,332 --> 00:34:27,669
I even heard Sonoma's a
beautiful
place this time of year.

545
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:28,795
- She's there.

546
00:34:28,837 --> 00:34:30,755
- Sonoma?
- Humboldt County.

547
00:34:30,797 --> 00:34:31,881
- How can you tell?

548
00:34:31,923 --> 00:34:33,425
- I've got location tracking
enabled

549
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:35,468
on all the family plan phones.

550
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,262
- Babe, I'm on the family plan.

551
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:42,726
(phone ringing)

552
00:34:48,565 --> 00:34:49,774
- Sheriff Owen.

553
00:34:49,816 --> 00:34:52,319
- You've got to find my
daughter!

554
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,279
(upbeat show music)

555
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:57,616
- Becca? You see my good knife
around?

556
00:34:57,657 --> 00:35:00,660
(upbeat show music)

557
00:35:26,186 --> 00:35:28,271
Rebecca Jacobs?

558
00:35:28,313 --> 00:35:31,399
How about you give her old
man a little hand here?

559
00:35:31,441 --> 00:35:34,527
(upbeat show music)

560
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:47,832
- You know, it's probably
in the fucking kitchen,

561
00:35:47,874 --> 00:35:49,459
where you always put it.

562
00:35:50,669 --> 00:35:53,672
(upbeat show music)

563
00:36:03,014 --> 00:36:05,016
It's right fucking here.

564
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:10,605
(upbeat show music)

565
00:36:12,524 --> 00:36:14,150
- [Tim] Ah, there's my Baby.

566
00:36:14,192 --> 00:36:15,193
- [Becca] Here.

567
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:20,532
- Yeah, that's the one
now. Well thank you, dear.

568
00:36:20,573 --> 00:36:23,576
(upbeat show music)

569
00:36:33,169 --> 00:36:35,839
- Hold on. This like the
"Texas Chain Saw Massacre".

570
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,173
(shushing)

571
00:36:37,215 --> 00:36:38,425
They ain't 'bout to be
cutting off our face,

572
00:36:38,466 --> 00:36:39,718
running around in these woods.

573
00:36:39,759 --> 00:36:41,761
- This isn't a fucking movie.

574
00:36:41,803 --> 00:36:43,179
Shut up.

575
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:47,308
Excuse me?

576
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:49,102
- Oh, ladies. Can I help you?

577
00:36:49,144 --> 00:36:51,604
We just need to use your phone.

578
00:36:53,189 --> 00:36:54,983
Well.

579
00:36:55,024 --> 00:36:58,278
Come on in. It's nice
and safe and warm inside.

580
00:37:00,029 --> 00:37:02,657
Oh this? Don't pay no mind.

581
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:04,284
I was just whittling. Here,
here, here.

582
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:07,036
Why don't you just take it,
and you feel safer with, huh?

583
00:37:08,455 --> 00:37:10,248
- I'm sorry, we just.

584
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,958
We just want to use your phone.

585
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,669
- Well sure. Come on in.

586
00:37:14,711 --> 00:37:16,713
Oh, here's my daughter.

587
00:37:16,755 --> 00:37:19,716
How about some nice warm
tea for these young ladies?

588
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:22,802
- Sure thing.

589
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:25,138
- [Kassi] Okay. Thank you.

590
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,514
- That bitch looks fucking
crazy.

591
00:37:26,556 --> 00:37:28,892
- Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

592
00:37:29,934 --> 00:37:31,352
- She killed him.

593
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,232
- [Becca] You ladies do come in.

594
00:37:36,274 --> 00:37:37,692
- Look, I've told you 100 times.

595
00:37:37,734 --> 00:37:40,111
I can't help you if you don't
calm down.

596
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:41,446
- I am calm.

597
00:37:41,488 --> 00:37:43,740
I'm doing your goddamn
job for you, aren't I?

598
00:37:43,782 --> 00:37:45,074
- Well look, I have to admit,

599
00:37:45,116 --> 00:37:47,160
the coordinates and
maps you sent, that was,

600
00:37:47,202 --> 00:37:49,412
that was some impressive work.

601
00:37:49,454 --> 00:37:50,955
- Well, thank you.

602
00:37:50,997 --> 00:37:52,290
It's mostly through Google Maps,

603
00:37:52,332 --> 00:37:53,583
and Street View that I found
them.

604
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,168
- Yes you did.

605
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,337
- Well, you know, I know most
of these people out there.

606
00:37:57,378 --> 00:38:00,840
Most of those people and
just good Christian folks.

607
00:38:00,882 --> 00:38:02,634
This one down at the bottom
though.

608
00:38:04,677 --> 00:38:05,970
Yeah, I don't know, I guess
it's worth

609
00:38:06,012 --> 00:38:07,931
sending somebody out to
check it out for you.

610
00:38:07,972 --> 00:38:09,891
- Well, what are you waiting
for?

611
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:12,519
Call them now, you idiot.

612
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,978
- So you're saying that you
like it

613
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,022
when she licks you there?

614
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,649
- Yeah, man.

615
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,526
It just means she really
loves me, you know?

616
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:20,985
At least that's how I see it.

617
00:38:21,027 --> 00:38:22,987
- A man's got to have some
boundaries.

618
00:38:23,029 --> 00:38:24,364
- Boundaries?

619
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:25,907
Come on, man.

620
00:38:25,949 --> 00:38:27,492
You want me to stop her,
and get her all upset?

621
00:38:27,534 --> 00:38:30,662
- I mean, yeah man. Look look,
that's all you, you know.

622
00:38:30,703 --> 00:38:33,248
I just can't have a dog tongue
all in my ear, you know?

623
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:36,042
Is this unhygienic.

624
00:38:36,084 --> 00:38:38,378
- [Sheriff] Marlack, you got a
copy?

625
00:38:38,419 --> 00:38:39,420
- Unhygienic?

626
00:38:41,422 --> 00:38:42,423
Un-hygienic.

627
00:38:45,718 --> 00:38:47,387
- Marlack here. Could
you repeat that? Over.

628
00:38:47,428 --> 00:38:48,680
- Yeah, you guys buy that old

629
00:38:48,721 --> 00:38:51,140
Crosspoint property up on the
North Ridge?

630
00:38:51,182 --> 00:38:53,518
- Yeah. We're about a
mile away from that place.

631
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,894
- Look, I got out some
hysterical mom,

632
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:56,604
thinks her daughter's lost out
there.

633
00:38:56,646 --> 00:38:58,690
Phone GPS puts her in that area.

634
00:38:58,731 --> 00:39:00,233
Can you guys try to find this
girl,

635
00:39:00,275 --> 00:39:03,736
and help get this crazy-ass
woman off my back?

636
00:39:03,778 --> 00:39:06,072
- [Marlack] I'll head over
there and check it out.

637
00:39:06,114 --> 00:39:08,116
- Good deal. Keep me posted.
Over.

638
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:15,248
- We got a call.

639
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:16,416
- Is it some bullshit?

640
00:39:16,457 --> 00:39:19,252
- Yeah, but we're close. Come
on.

641
00:39:19,294 --> 00:39:21,129
- All right. Let's go.

642
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,549
(calm music)

643
00:39:35,768 --> 00:39:39,439
- [Becca] Here ladies.
(tray slams down) Drink up.

644
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,481
- Becca.

645
00:39:42,734 --> 00:39:45,194
Oh, and I bet you that
tastes good, don't it?

646
00:39:45,236 --> 00:39:49,407
Please go right ahead.
It'll be good for you.

647
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:51,951
- My head feels like
it's literally swelling.

648
00:39:51,993 --> 00:39:52,994
- Me too.

649
00:39:53,036 --> 00:39:54,662
- [Kassi] Are you okay?

650
00:39:54,704 --> 00:39:56,998
- [Chris] Oh my God.

651
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,875
- Chris, are you okay?

652
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,961
Chris?

653
00:40:03,296 --> 00:40:04,339
What did you do?

654
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,049
(loud thumping)

655
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:08,509
(calm music)

656
00:40:32,617 --> 00:40:34,243
- Then she took Jonathon from
me.

657
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:37,538
I knew.

658
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,333
I knew she was terrible from
the way she looked at him.

659
00:40:45,505 --> 00:40:51,386
- Did the girl you speak of
happen to look like this?

660
00:40:51,427 --> 00:40:53,596
(gasping)

661
00:40:55,556 --> 00:40:59,477
- That's her. That's that
terrible girl.

662
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:01,354
She took him.

663
00:41:01,396 --> 00:41:02,855
She took him from me.

664
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:05,149
- I will avenge him for you.

665
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:07,944
Can you please show me the
direction in which she came?

666
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,534
- She came from that way.

667
00:41:17,537 --> 00:41:20,415
- What the hell is wrong with
you?

668
00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:25,461
- (belt hitting)
- (girl groaning)

669
00:41:31,134 --> 00:41:33,845
(dramatic music)

670
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,899
(people whistling)

671
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:04,292
(suspenseful music)

672
00:42:15,636 --> 00:42:16,846
- Get the girl.

673
00:42:21,267 --> 00:42:23,227
- (coughing)
- Marlack here.

674
00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:25,980
We got multiple bodies at this
house you just sent us to.

675
00:42:26,022 --> 00:42:28,066
And the girl is nowhere to be
found.

676
00:42:28,107 --> 00:42:29,067
- [Sheriff] Can you guys
try to find this girl,

677
00:42:29,108 --> 00:42:30,693
and help this crazy-ass woman-

678
00:42:30,735 --> 00:42:32,487
- We're gonna head down the
mountain and canvas the area.

679
00:42:32,528 --> 00:42:34,572
Maybe she'll turn up
down the road,
or at the neighbor's house.

680
00:42:34,614 --> 00:42:36,157
- [Sheriff] Phone GPS
puts her in that area.

681
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:38,493
- Yeah, I get that her phone's
GPS says that she's here.

682
00:42:38,534 --> 00:42:40,369
But trust me, she's not.

683
00:42:40,411 --> 00:42:42,497
Call the local police, and
let them know what we found.

684
00:42:42,538 --> 00:42:44,248
And let us do our job.

685
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,875
- I don't know what the
happened in there.

686
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:48,377
But whatever it is, that girl
had something to do with it.

687
00:42:48,419 --> 00:42:50,088
Why else would her phone be
inside?

688
00:42:50,129 --> 00:42:52,465
- Her mom called the
station, trying to find her.

689
00:42:52,507 --> 00:42:54,884
This is where her phone GPS
said she was.

690
00:42:54,926 --> 00:42:55,885
Maybe she got kidnapped or-

691
00:42:55,927 --> 00:42:57,512
- All right look.

692
00:42:57,553 --> 00:42:59,430
Let's just head
down the mountain,
and see if she turns up.

693
00:42:59,472 --> 00:43:01,557
And we better be ready
for battle if we run into

694
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,476
whoever the fuck did that shit
in there.

695
00:43:03,518 --> 00:43:06,521
(suspenseful music)

696
00:43:30,044 --> 00:43:33,047
(breathing heavily)

697
00:43:35,466 --> 00:43:40,471
- (voices overlapping)
- (all crying)

698
00:43:43,224 --> 00:43:44,851
- [Becca] So you're awake?

699
00:43:44,892 --> 00:43:47,478
(girls crying)

700
00:43:50,523 --> 00:43:53,442
- Oh, now don't you
worry your little heads.

701
00:43:53,484 --> 00:43:56,070
We'll all be done real soon now.

702
00:43:56,112 --> 00:43:58,698
(girls crying)

703
00:44:03,744 --> 00:44:05,371
- All right, so the closest
property

704
00:44:05,413 --> 00:44:07,165
is about two miles this way.

705
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,461
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, man.

706
00:44:12,503 --> 00:44:13,838
You can't do that up in here.

707
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,173
You know you can get
suspended for that, right?

708
00:44:15,214 --> 00:44:17,341
Or worse, if you gotta
use that gun tonight.

709
00:44:19,135 --> 00:44:20,803
Fuck our luck, man.

710
00:44:22,555 --> 00:44:24,765
I think this is it right here.

711
00:44:27,393 --> 00:44:29,395
All right, let's go
check this out.

712
00:44:29,437 --> 00:44:31,647
- [Tim] Ah, and look at you.

713
00:44:31,689 --> 00:44:33,399
- Let us out of here!

714
00:44:33,441 --> 00:44:37,361
- I'm afraid I can't do
that darling. (laughing)

715
00:44:37,403 --> 00:44:41,741
Oh yeah, and look at you.
How are you doing there, girl?

716
00:44:41,782 --> 00:44:42,992
(knocking on door)

717
00:44:43,034 --> 00:44:45,244
(girls screaming)

718
00:44:45,286 --> 00:44:47,622
(punch lands)

719
00:44:47,663 --> 00:44:49,874
Not a sound.

720
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:52,919
(suspenseful music)

721
00:44:55,963 --> 00:44:57,590
What the hell's going on out
there?

722
00:44:57,632 --> 00:44:58,758
- It's the fucking cops.

723
00:44:58,799 --> 00:44:59,884
- Well, then just go out there

724
00:44:59,926 --> 00:45:01,052
and flash your tits or
something.

725
00:45:01,093 --> 00:45:02,720
- I'm not gonna show my fucking
tits.

726
00:45:02,762 --> 00:45:04,055
Go fucking deal with the cops.

727
00:45:04,096 --> 00:45:05,223
I'll deal
with the fucking girls.

728
00:45:05,264 --> 00:45:06,641
- Okay, just for once
in your life,

729
00:45:06,682 --> 00:45:07,892
can you just do something right?

730
00:45:07,934 --> 00:45:10,228
Now just take care of them,
please?

731
00:45:10,269 --> 00:45:12,855
- So, I'm supposed to take care
of them.

732
00:45:12,897 --> 00:45:15,900
(suspenseful music)

733
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:21,906
- Officers. What can I do
for you tonight?

734
00:45:21,948 --> 00:45:24,575
- Good evening, Sir.
Sorry to bother you.

735
00:45:24,617 --> 00:45:26,577
We received a call
from concerned mother.

736
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:28,454
Seems her daughter never rang
last night,

737
00:45:28,496 --> 00:45:31,666
and the GPS from he phone
records place her
in these parts.

738
00:45:31,707 --> 00:45:34,961
We were just wondering if
you've seen or heard anything.

739
00:45:35,002 --> 00:45:38,506
- No. No, I haven't seen no
girls around here tonight.

740
00:45:38,547 --> 00:45:39,590
- Please help us. Please help
us.

741
00:45:39,632 --> 00:45:42,635
(voices overlapping)

742
00:45:42,677 --> 00:45:44,345
- I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

743
00:45:44,387 --> 00:45:46,764
You think I want to be
out here? I'm stuck.

744
00:45:46,806 --> 00:45:48,307
- But you have a gun.

745
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:52,645
- Shoot that mother fucker!
Go shoot his ass! Please?

746
00:45:53,771 --> 00:45:55,189
- You alone tonight, sir?

747
00:45:55,231 --> 00:45:58,359
- Oh yeah, all alone. Well,
except for my daughter.

748
00:45:58,401 --> 00:46:00,361
You know, but I don't even
consider her

749
00:46:00,403 --> 00:46:02,571
a person anymore if you know
what I mean.

750
00:46:02,613 --> 00:46:03,948
- Well, would you mind if we
asked her

751
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,700
if she's seen anything?

752
00:46:05,741 --> 00:46:08,661
- Well, she's in her robe
and curlers right now.

753
00:46:08,703 --> 00:46:11,497
And believe me you don't
want to be seeing that.

754
00:46:11,539 --> 00:46:13,833
But just hold on a second.
I'll go ask her, okay?

755
00:46:13,874 --> 00:46:15,293
- Thank you, sir.

756
00:46:15,334 --> 00:46:18,337
(suspenseful music)

757
00:46:20,089 --> 00:46:22,842
- It is the damn police.

758
00:46:22,883 --> 00:46:24,135
- Thank God.

759
00:46:24,176 --> 00:46:28,014
- Shut the fuck up. Do you
understand?

760
00:46:28,055 --> 00:46:30,766
Stay quiet, or you're gonna
get a bullet in the head.

761
00:46:30,808 --> 00:46:31,809
- I'm gonna take a look around.

762
00:46:31,851 --> 00:46:32,852
- All right.

763
00:46:35,313 --> 00:46:36,522
(knocking on door)

764
00:46:36,564 --> 00:46:38,316
- Take this, and keep them
fucking quiet.

765
00:46:38,357 --> 00:46:40,735
I'm coming, officer. I'll be
right there.

766
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:43,821
- (knocking on door)
- Hello?

767
00:46:48,367 --> 00:46:53,080
- (soft chittering)
- (suspenseful music)

768
00:46:53,122 --> 00:46:54,498
What is that?

769
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,543
(suspenseful music)

770
00:47:04,342 --> 00:47:07,094
(dramatic music)

771
00:47:08,971 --> 00:47:10,473
(girls crying)

772
00:47:10,514 --> 00:47:12,892
- You don't have to be a victim
too.

773
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:14,310
Just come with us.

774
00:47:14,352 --> 00:47:17,772
We can get out of here,
if you just come with us.

775
00:47:17,813 --> 00:47:20,358
- Do I look like a victim to
you, bitch?

776
00:47:20,399 --> 00:47:23,235
(dramatic music)

777
00:47:23,277 --> 00:47:27,656
- Holy shit, there's a dead
policeman out on my porch.

778
00:47:27,698 --> 00:47:29,200
- [Marlack] This is Deputy
Marlack. I'm coming in.

779
00:47:29,241 --> 00:47:30,618
- [Tim] What do we do now?

780
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:31,827
- [Marlack] If you got any
weapons,

781
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:33,412
place them on the ground now.

782
00:47:33,454 --> 00:47:36,207
(dramatic music)

783
00:47:39,043 --> 00:47:40,127
Put the gun down.

784
00:47:40,169 --> 00:47:41,796
- I had no choice.

785
00:47:41,837 --> 00:47:43,923
- Put the gun down, ma'am.
We can just talk about this.

786
00:47:43,964 --> 00:47:45,841
- He made me do it.
- Do what?

787
00:47:45,883 --> 00:47:47,218
- He hit me so much.

788
00:47:47,259 --> 00:47:50,179
- Oh shut your hole, you cock
scab.

789
00:47:50,221 --> 00:47:52,139
- Ma'am, I need you to put
the gun down right now.

790
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:53,974
Ma'am, drop the gun now.

791
00:47:54,016 --> 00:47:56,394
- No. No.

792
00:47:56,435 --> 00:47:58,145
- Don't point your gun. Right
now.

793
00:47:58,187 --> 00:47:59,772
- Damn you, cunt. God damned.

794
00:47:59,814 --> 00:48:02,400
(guns firing)

795
00:48:03,734 --> 00:48:06,112
(suspenseful music)

796
00:48:06,153 --> 00:48:09,365
(growling)

797
00:48:09,407 --> 00:48:14,412
- (dramatic music)
- (grunting)

798
00:48:33,973 --> 00:48:35,683
- Don't leave me, guys.

799
00:48:35,724 --> 00:48:38,727
(suspenseful music)

800
00:48:46,652 --> 00:48:48,279
- Wait wait, wait wait wait.

801
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,321
What about Marissa?

802
00:48:50,906 --> 00:48:52,408
- You can't be serious.

803
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:54,535
You really want to die for
that bitch? Let's go, girl.

804
00:48:54,577 --> 00:48:57,538
- We can't just leave her
there. That's fucked up.

805
00:48:58,414 --> 00:48:59,999
(gun fires)

806
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,585
- Yo, bitch. That sounds like
death to me girl. Let's go.

807
00:49:02,626 --> 00:49:05,754
- No, I can't. I can't. I'm
going in alone. I'll catch up.

808
00:49:08,966 --> 00:49:11,969
(suspenseful music)

809
00:49:19,435 --> 00:49:22,188
- Kassi, Christiana. Oh, thank
God.

810
00:49:22,229 --> 00:49:24,815
(girls crying)

811
00:49:26,901 --> 00:49:29,904
(suspenseful music)

812
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,659
- [Kassi] He's coming. He's
coming.

813
00:49:36,702 --> 00:49:39,705
(suspenseful music)

814
00:49:59,225 --> 00:50:01,477
(coughing)

815
00:50:16,825 --> 00:50:19,245
(chittering)

816
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:23,457
(girls screaming)

817
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:31,674
(whistling)

818
00:50:54,697 --> 00:50:59,702
- (chittering)
- (dramatic music)

819
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:04,540
(whistling continues)

820
00:51:12,047 --> 00:51:17,136
- (chittering)
- (dramatic music)

821
00:51:17,177 --> 00:51:19,513
(screaming)

822
00:51:20,931 --> 00:51:23,684
(dramatic music)

823
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:34,445
- What the fuck?

824
00:51:36,488 --> 00:51:38,282
What the fuck is going on?

825
00:51:38,324 --> 00:51:40,909
We're on this mountain with
a fucking deranged killer.

826
00:51:40,951 --> 00:51:43,996
And there's something else down
there,

827
00:51:44,038 --> 00:51:45,289
something out of this world.

828
00:51:45,331 --> 00:51:47,416
- Kassi's not lying.

829
00:51:47,458 --> 00:51:49,627
We were in the fucking weirdo's
kitchen.

830
00:51:49,668 --> 00:51:51,795
This girl looking figure
killed the old man.

831
00:51:51,837 --> 00:51:53,130
- What?

832
00:51:53,172 --> 00:51:54,298
- If it had seen us, we
would have been next.

833
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,716
Yo, all I know

834
00:51:55,758 --> 00:51:58,135
is we need to get to the
bottom of this mountain.

835
00:51:58,177 --> 00:52:01,764
And when we do, we're going
straight to the cops, okay?

836
00:52:01,805 --> 00:52:04,141
No, we need to go right now.

837
00:52:04,183 --> 00:52:06,935
(dramatic music)

838
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,117
(dogs howling)

839
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:23,160
- Yo, yo, yo.

840
00:52:24,953 --> 00:52:26,664
- There's nothing there.

841
00:52:26,705 --> 00:52:31,460
Keep your voice down. You're
gonna get us all killed.

842
00:52:31,502 --> 00:52:32,920
- (twig snaps)
- I heard it too!

843
00:52:32,961 --> 00:52:36,757
(suspenseful music)

844
00:52:36,799 --> 00:52:37,800
- Let's keep on pushing.

845
00:52:40,761 --> 00:52:42,054
(all screaming)

846
00:52:42,096 --> 00:52:43,847
- Why are you girls on my
property?

847
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:46,225
You're trespassing.

848
00:52:47,935 --> 00:52:49,603
Come with me.

849
00:52:49,645 --> 00:52:51,355
It isn't safe for you here.

850
00:52:52,564 --> 00:52:55,275
(dramatic music)

851
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:57,403
- Girls, let's go.

852
00:52:57,444 --> 00:52:59,196
- Who the fuck is she?
- I don't know.

853
00:52:59,238 --> 00:53:01,281
- Come on. What choice do we
have?

854
00:53:01,323 --> 00:53:04,493
- (dogs howling)
- Fuck!

855
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:08,288
- I don't own a phone,

856
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:11,041
if that's what you're waiting
to ask me.

857
00:53:11,083 --> 00:53:14,044
Girls, you sure look cold.

858
00:53:14,086 --> 00:53:15,629
Can I get you some tea?

859
00:53:15,671 --> 00:53:21,176
- No. We've had enough tea
for lifetime today. Thank you.

860
00:53:21,218 --> 00:53:22,761
- Yeah, if you could just point
us

861
00:53:22,803 --> 00:53:24,930
the direction of town or a
road to how to get out of here.

862
00:53:24,972 --> 00:53:27,725
- Well, town is 20 or so miles
away.

863
00:53:27,766 --> 00:53:29,643
And at this time of night,

864
00:53:29,685 --> 00:53:32,271
you never know who
you'll meet on the road.

865
00:53:32,312 --> 00:53:35,107
Might be worse than the
trouble you're already in.

866
00:53:35,149 --> 00:53:36,942
- How do you know we've been in
trouble?

867
00:53:36,984 --> 00:53:39,069
- I've been watching you.

868
00:53:39,111 --> 00:53:42,114
- What do you mean,
you've been watching us?

869
00:53:42,156 --> 00:53:43,615
- Ladies, I think we
should just go because-

870
00:53:43,657 --> 00:53:46,744
- Oh, relax. I'm not interested
in you.

871
00:53:47,870 --> 00:53:49,538
I was watching the boy.

872
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,664
- Who, Sasha?

873
00:53:50,706 --> 00:53:51,915
- What about Sasha?

874
00:53:51,957 --> 00:53:53,667
- He stole something from me.

875
00:53:53,709 --> 00:53:55,335
- [Kassi] What?

876
00:53:55,377 --> 00:54:00,215
- A book, a very old book that
was given to me by my mother,

877
00:54:01,842 --> 00:54:05,596
which was given to her by
her mother, and her mother,

878
00:54:05,637 --> 00:54:09,558
and her mother, and her
mother and her mother,

879
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,269
and her mother, and her
mother, and her mother,

880
00:54:12,311 --> 00:54:16,940
which was given to her
and the Devil himself.

881
00:54:16,982 --> 00:54:19,610
- Yo, why does everything
have to be so demonic?

882
00:54:19,651 --> 00:54:22,988
- Wait. So what would
Sasha want with this book?

883
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,656
- I think he thought it would
protect him

884
00:54:24,698 --> 00:54:28,118
from the angry spirit in the
woods.

885
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,953
- What kind of spirit?

886
00:54:29,995 --> 00:54:32,331
- Many many years ago,

887
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:35,125
there was a convent in these
mountains.

888
00:54:35,167 --> 00:54:37,336
And there was a girl there,

889
00:54:37,377 --> 00:54:40,714
who was not much older
than the three of you.

890
00:54:40,756 --> 00:54:43,759
(suspenseful music)

891
00:54:48,764 --> 00:54:51,183
(Nun crying)

892
00:54:52,184 --> 00:54:54,436
(grunting)

893
00:54:57,481 --> 00:55:00,484
(suspenseful music)

894
00:56:26,945 --> 00:56:28,363
- No!

895
00:56:28,405 --> 00:56:31,742
Do you wish to end up
inside of the pot, tonight?

896
00:56:31,783 --> 00:56:36,371
What you will find inside
is my last uninvited guest.

897
00:56:38,248 --> 00:56:40,876
(laughing)

898
00:56:40,918 --> 00:56:41,960
- I know who you are.

899
00:56:43,503 --> 00:56:45,881
They told me that you lived out
here.

900
00:56:45,923 --> 00:56:48,216
They told me you were
evil, and you knew spell.

901
00:56:48,258 --> 00:56:50,928
(laughing maniacally)

902
00:56:50,969 --> 00:56:55,432
- And you decided to come
here anyway. (laughing)

903
00:56:55,474 --> 00:56:57,976
You're a Nun. (laughing)

904
00:56:58,018 --> 00:56:59,895
- I came to make an offer,

905
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:03,148
to your savior.

906
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:04,191
- You?

907
00:57:05,525 --> 00:57:07,027
The servant of the cloth?

908
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:13,408
- Every night I'm laid down,

909
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:15,577
and my virtue's brutally taken
from me.

910
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,624
I no longer choose to serve a
false God

911
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:23,543
that's never answered one of my
prayers.

912
00:57:27,422 --> 00:57:30,384
(owl hooting)

913
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:33,428
(suspenseful music)

914
00:57:39,101 --> 00:57:40,727
- When calling upon a wicked
spirit,

915
00:57:40,769 --> 00:57:44,731
we must make him aware of the
trade that we want to happen.

916
00:57:44,773 --> 00:57:47,901
In your case, there is a
specific entity

917
00:57:47,943 --> 00:57:52,948
who seeks vengeance for the
abused soul, such as yours.

918
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,786
Now, you must shed the clothes

919
00:57:57,828 --> 00:58:00,998
that you are wearing, and
throw it into the fire.

920
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:04,626
(suspenseful music)

921
00:58:04,668 --> 00:58:07,295
My dear father from down below,

922
00:58:07,337 --> 00:58:10,590
we ask for your permission to
call upon

923
00:58:10,632 --> 00:58:15,762
one of your children that
you gracefully created.

924
00:58:15,804 --> 00:58:19,266
Lillith, she's gonna
leave her foolish convent,

925
00:58:19,307 --> 00:58:24,938
and join you in order to do
your bidding up here on Earth.

926
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:28,025
She's gone to leave her faith
behind,

927
00:58:28,066 --> 00:58:31,528
and sign her soul to you.

928
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:35,574
(speaking in foreign language)

929
00:58:37,034 --> 00:58:38,744
(dramatic music)

930
00:58:38,785 --> 00:58:40,829
- The Devil doesn't give gifts,

931
00:58:40,871 --> 00:58:43,248
without taking something in
return.

932
00:58:44,791 --> 00:58:48,628
So now her spirit is
trapped in this plane,

933
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:53,008
and she'll roam the woods
for all of eternity,

934
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:58,722
seeking vengeance for the
past whenever she can find it.

935
00:58:58,764 --> 00:59:01,600
- Why do these people have
to be so fucking crazy?

936
00:59:01,641 --> 00:59:04,311
- Crazy? Who are you calling
crazy, huh?

937
00:59:04,352 --> 00:59:06,146
- I mean like, if the shoe fits.

938
00:59:06,188 --> 00:59:07,814
- Get out.
- Not but we-

939
00:59:07,856 --> 00:59:09,858
- Get out! Get out! Get out!

940
00:59:11,443 --> 00:59:16,448
- (dramatic music)
- (girls crying)

941
00:59:23,455 --> 00:59:25,957
(crow cawing)

942
00:59:31,713 --> 00:59:33,799
- We have to keep going.

943
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,052
If we don't, who knows
what sort of crazy we'll run
into next?

944
00:59:37,094 --> 00:59:40,347
- I just need a second. I just,
I just want to rest my eyes.

945
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,145
- I want to keep going. I know
we need to, but she's right.

946
00:59:47,187 --> 00:59:48,188
We should rest.

947
00:59:49,773 --> 00:59:52,776
We'll be safer in daylight
anyway.

948
00:59:52,818 --> 00:59:55,320
- I don't think we're safe
as long as we're up here.

949
00:59:56,822 --> 00:59:57,823
You rest.

950
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:00,700
I'll keep lookout.

951
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:05,163
(dramatic music)

952
01:00:15,882 --> 01:00:18,552
(birds singing)

953
01:00:22,722 --> 01:00:24,516
(dog barking)

954
01:00:24,558 --> 01:00:27,561
(suspenseful music)

955
01:00:30,063 --> 01:00:32,232
Wake up, wake up. Wake the fuck
up.

956
01:00:32,274 --> 01:00:35,277
(suspenseful music)

957
01:00:36,528 --> 01:00:39,531
We gotta leave now. Wake up.

958
01:00:39,573 --> 01:00:42,784
- Where do we go? Which way do
we go?

959
01:00:42,826 --> 01:00:47,831
- (suspenseful music)
- (dog barking)

960
01:00:51,001 --> 01:00:55,005
- Yeah, you smell it.
Which way did they go?

961
01:00:55,046 --> 01:00:59,176
Run, rabbit. Yeah we're
onto you now, bitches.

962
01:00:59,217 --> 01:01:04,598
- (dramatic music)
- (dog barking)

963
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,892
(dog barking)

964
01:01:06,933 --> 01:01:07,976
Run!

965
01:01:08,018 --> 01:01:13,023
- (dramatic music)
- (dog barking)

966
01:01:27,662 --> 01:01:29,456
(gun fires)

967
01:01:29,497 --> 01:01:31,291
- Don't y'all take another step
now.

968
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:32,751
- What are we doing?

969
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,086
- Go on, get.

970
01:01:35,128 --> 01:01:37,631
(grunting)

971
01:01:37,672 --> 01:01:40,508
- I'd hate to put another
hole through you, honey.

972
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:42,260
You too, fuck tits.

973
01:01:42,302 --> 01:01:43,470
(laughing)

974
01:01:43,511 --> 01:01:45,597
(dog barking)

975
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:49,351
- Looks we come across a couple
of T makers come this far.

976
01:01:49,392 --> 01:01:51,603
You're fucked, bitches.

977
01:01:56,608 --> 01:01:57,692
(dog growling)

978
01:01:57,734 --> 01:01:58,777
- What do you think we should do

979
01:01:58,818 --> 01:02:01,071
with these
pretty little things?

980
01:02:01,112 --> 01:02:02,864
- I got a few ideas for you
ladies.

981
01:02:04,241 --> 01:02:06,618
- I say we hog tie them to the
shed,

982
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,286
have ourselves a Mexican fiesta.

983
01:02:09,746 --> 01:02:11,873
I can't wait to bust that
pinata open.

984
01:02:11,915 --> 01:02:14,709
(dog barking)

985
01:02:14,751 --> 01:02:17,170
What are you gonna do, Frank.

986
01:02:17,212 --> 01:02:18,797
- I like that idea.

987
01:02:19,673 --> 01:02:20,674
- Oh my God.

988
01:02:21,591 --> 01:02:24,344
(dramatic music)

989
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:29,766
(dog barking)

990
01:02:34,854 --> 01:02:37,607
(Marissa crying)

991
01:02:44,406 --> 01:02:45,699
- What the fuck, Heather?

992
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:47,117
- Baby.
- Relax, man.

993
01:02:47,158 --> 01:02:49,286
- Relax? No, you fucking relax,
man.

994
01:02:49,327 --> 01:02:50,954
- Baby, you know I love you.

995
01:02:50,996 --> 01:02:53,290
- You know what?
Fuck this guy.

996
01:02:53,331 --> 01:02:55,750
And you can't take your
fucking eyes off these.

997
01:02:55,792 --> 01:02:57,294
Don't you fucking touch me.

998
01:02:57,335 --> 01:02:59,796
Don't fucking touch me. Don't
touch me.

999
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:01,965
Man get the off me, man. What
the fuck you? Come on, man.

1000
01:03:03,383 --> 01:03:06,136
(dramatic music)

1001
01:03:09,306 --> 01:03:11,182
- [Heather] Why you
gotta be so hard on him?

1002
01:03:11,224 --> 01:03:12,684
- [Frank] He'll be all right.

1003
01:03:12,726 --> 01:03:14,019
(girls scream)

1004
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,688
Just gotta ween him off
that tit, that's all.

1005
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:18,523
- [Heather] Yeah? You first.

1006
01:03:18,565 --> 01:03:21,651
(suspenseful music)

1007
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:36,541
- Oh yeah.

1008
01:03:41,421 --> 01:03:43,089
Oh you're a dirty bitch, huh?

1009
01:03:43,131 --> 01:03:45,342
- What the fuck are you looking
at, huh?

1010
01:03:46,801 --> 01:03:48,595
You got a little something on
her face.

1011
01:03:48,636 --> 01:03:50,972
(girls crying)

1012
01:03:51,014 --> 01:03:53,099
You got a fucking problem?

1013
01:03:53,141 --> 01:03:55,602
I don't like you. Come here.

1014
01:03:55,643 --> 01:03:59,272
- (dog barking)
- (Marissa screaming)

1015
01:03:59,314 --> 01:04:02,484
- (dog barking)
- (James mimics dog barking)

1016
01:04:02,525 --> 01:04:05,278
Yeah, fuck you! Yeah,
you think I'm a joke?

1017
01:04:13,078 --> 01:04:14,621
- I apologize about my friend.

1018
01:04:16,623 --> 01:04:17,999
He's a real asshole.

1019
01:04:24,172 --> 01:04:27,217
- Oh fuck, fuck.
- (dog barking)

1020
01:04:27,258 --> 01:04:28,551
- Let me help you out a little.

1021
01:04:28,593 --> 01:04:29,761
- No! Fuck no!

1022
01:04:34,057 --> 01:04:35,058
Please stop.

1023
01:04:37,644 --> 01:04:39,396
- That's interesting.

1024
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,399
- You fucking asshole.

1025
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,901
- Ooh, you're a little feisty?

1026
01:04:44,943 --> 01:04:47,112
How about you, Mexicana?

1027
01:04:47,153 --> 01:04:48,947
You want to suck my dick?

1028
01:04:48,988 --> 01:04:50,532
You like to dance a little bit?

1029
01:04:51,408 --> 01:04:52,742
Maybe a little of that?

1030
01:04:52,784 --> 01:04:56,996
- (slap lands)
- (Chris crying)

1031
01:04:57,038 --> 01:04:58,498
- [Heather] How about this?

1032
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:00,625
- [James] And get the fuck
out the way. I can't see.

1033
01:05:02,585 --> 01:05:03,586
- [Heather] What?

1034
01:05:05,046 --> 01:05:07,549
Boys, this one thing she's
tough.

1035
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:09,467
- [Frank] We gonna have to tame
her, baby.

1036
01:05:11,719 --> 01:05:15,849
- (slap lands)
- (girls crying)

1037
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:17,142
- Oh my God.

1038
01:05:17,183 --> 01:05:19,227
- [Heather] You got
something to say to me?

1039
01:05:21,771 --> 01:05:23,481
- Fucking bitch.

1040
01:05:23,523 --> 01:05:25,316
- What'd you say?

1041
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:26,901
- I said fucking bitch.

1042
01:05:35,285 --> 01:05:36,369
- I got an idea.

1043
01:05:38,746 --> 01:05:41,332
(girls crying)

1044
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:44,043
We're gonna play a game.

1045
01:05:44,085 --> 01:05:46,671
(girls crying)

1046
01:05:49,507 --> 01:05:51,217
You ladies like games?

1047
01:05:51,259 --> 01:05:53,219
I got a nice riddle for you
ladies.

1048
01:05:54,637 --> 01:05:55,763
How did it go?

1049
01:05:58,475 --> 01:06:00,059
Eenie,

1050
01:06:00,101 --> 01:06:01,102
meenie,

1051
01:06:01,853 --> 01:06:02,854
minie,

1052
01:06:04,439 --> 01:06:05,440
mo,

1053
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:08,109
catch a nigger

1054
01:06:09,444 --> 01:06:10,695
by her toe.

1055
01:06:11,863 --> 01:06:13,490
If she hollers

1056
01:06:15,742 --> 01:06:17,619
let her go.

1057
01:06:18,703 --> 01:06:20,538
Eenie,

1058
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:21,581
meenie,

1059
01:06:22,832 --> 01:06:23,833
minie,

1060
01:06:25,502 --> 01:06:26,503
mo.

1061
01:06:27,212 --> 01:06:28,963
And you

1062
01:06:30,173 --> 01:06:31,799
are

1063
01:06:34,344 --> 01:06:35,345
it.
- (gun fires)

1064
01:06:35,386 --> 01:06:39,140
(girls crying and screaming)

1065
01:06:41,809 --> 01:06:43,603
Clean up your mess.

1066
01:06:43,645 --> 01:06:46,231
(girls crying)

1067
01:07:02,455 --> 01:07:04,874
- Baby, if all we're
gonna do is kill them,

1068
01:07:04,916 --> 01:07:07,293
why don't we get a little
creative?

1069
01:07:10,046 --> 01:07:12,048
- [Heather] You want to have
some fun?

1070
01:07:12,090 --> 01:07:14,509
- You know I want to have some
fun.

1071
01:07:17,345 --> 01:07:18,680
- How you doing?

1072
01:07:20,056 --> 01:07:21,516
Good boy.

1073
01:07:21,558 --> 01:07:23,810
Hey there, Big Red.

1074
01:07:23,851 --> 01:07:26,896
A little storm, we've
been through them before.

1075
01:07:26,938 --> 01:07:28,648
Okay, buddy.

1076
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:31,776
(suspenseful music)

1077
01:07:40,785 --> 01:07:41,786
Sara?

1078
01:07:42,495 --> 01:07:43,496
Is that you?

1079
01:07:46,207 --> 01:07:48,626
(calm music)

1080
01:08:06,978 --> 01:08:08,688
(gasps)

1081
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:11,065
- I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

1082
01:08:11,107 --> 01:08:12,483
- Are you lost?

1083
01:08:12,525 --> 01:08:15,903
- I'm not lost. I'm quite
the opposite, actually.

1084
01:08:15,945 --> 01:08:18,948
(suspenseful music)

1085
01:08:23,536 --> 01:08:25,038
I must apologize for just
showing up

1086
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:27,790
at your house out of nowhere.

1087
01:08:27,832 --> 01:08:29,709
I don't want to take up
too much of your time,

1088
01:08:29,751 --> 01:08:33,463
but do you have kin
that have gone missing?

1089
01:08:33,504 --> 01:08:35,214
Have you no men in your home?

1090
01:08:35,256 --> 01:08:36,758
- Just my husband.

1091
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:39,052
He's at the stables right
now, checking on his horse.

1092
01:08:39,093 --> 01:08:42,096
(suspenseful music)

1093
01:08:52,065 --> 01:08:53,316
Why do you ask?

1094
01:08:56,694 --> 01:08:57,820
(gun fires)

1095
01:08:57,862 --> 01:09:00,615
(dramatic music)

1096
01:09:13,836 --> 01:09:15,421
(gun fires)

1097
01:09:15,463 --> 01:09:18,216
(dramatic music)

1098
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:24,430
- [Heather] Get!

1099
01:09:24,472 --> 01:09:25,473
Get out there.

1100
01:09:26,683 --> 01:09:28,518
Get, nigger. Get.

1101
01:09:30,311 --> 01:09:31,312
I said get.

1102
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,607
Get up. Get.
- (dog barking)

1103
01:09:34,649 --> 01:09:36,651
Don't look at me.

1104
01:09:36,693 --> 01:09:37,694
Get up and move.

1105
01:09:39,612 --> 01:09:41,406
Keep moving, go.

1106
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:45,159
Get.

1107
01:09:46,077 --> 01:09:48,371
See that log? Go.

1108
01:09:48,413 --> 01:09:50,915
(dog barking)

1109
01:09:59,799 --> 01:10:02,468
- Let go of her. Get off of her.

1110
01:10:09,142 --> 01:10:11,978
(sniffing deeply)

1111
01:10:19,777 --> 01:10:21,863
- [Chris] Oh my God, eww.

1112
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,326
What the fuck?

1113
01:10:30,329 --> 01:10:31,956
(dramatic music)

1114
01:10:31,998 --> 01:10:33,207
- You're a real Picassee.

1115
01:10:33,249 --> 01:10:35,418
- It's pronounced Picasso.

1116
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:38,296
- You're right.

1117
01:10:38,337 --> 01:10:39,630
- [Mark] What we gonna do with
them?

1118
01:10:39,672 --> 01:10:41,966
- Let's fuck 'em. They're
right here, let's.

1119
01:10:42,008 --> 01:10:43,885
- [Chris] No.

1120
01:10:43,926 --> 01:10:45,553
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

1121
01:10:45,595 --> 01:10:46,554
Wouldn't you?

1122
01:10:46,596 --> 01:10:47,930
- Oh fuck. Fuck.

1123
01:10:49,849 --> 01:10:52,852
(suspenseful music)

1124
01:11:01,027 --> 01:11:02,111
- You know what, boys?

1125
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:04,447
This isn't fair.

1126
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,952
I'm gonna give you a chance.

1127
01:11:09,994 --> 01:11:14,123
I'm gonna give them a choice.
You can get raped or run.

1128
01:11:14,165 --> 01:11:16,751
(Chris crying)

1129
01:11:19,253 --> 01:11:21,422
Either way, you're fucked.

1130
01:11:23,758 --> 01:11:25,802
Now get up. I said move.

1131
01:11:27,053 --> 01:11:28,387
Get.

1132
01:11:28,429 --> 01:11:29,806
Get.

1133
01:11:29,847 --> 01:11:31,182
(gun fires)

1134
01:11:31,224 --> 01:11:35,436
Get. You got 57 seconds
till I release my hound.

1135
01:11:35,478 --> 01:11:38,314
(dramatic music)

1136
01:11:46,656 --> 01:11:49,200
(groaning in pain)

1137
01:11:49,242 --> 01:11:50,618
- You fucking ass hat.

1138
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:52,245
- Will you two stop
chasing each other's dicks,

1139
01:11:52,286 --> 01:11:54,330
and get these girls
before this whole thing

1140
01:11:54,372 --> 01:11:55,915
turns into a real fuck up?

1141
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:57,834
Get!

1142
01:11:59,085 --> 01:12:03,047
- (dog barking)
- (dramatic music)

1143
01:12:03,089 --> 01:12:05,424
- Yeah, we smell you bitches.

1144
01:12:05,466 --> 01:12:08,052
Oh, that pussy smells real nice.

1145
01:12:08,094 --> 01:12:10,221
- Bet you a blow job I can nab
them first.

1146
01:12:10,263 --> 01:12:11,848
(dramatic music)

1147
01:12:11,889 --> 01:12:13,432
- I'll take that bet.

1148
01:12:13,474 --> 01:12:16,227
(dramatic music)

1149
01:12:24,026 --> 01:12:25,778
- Yeah, we smell that pussy.

1150
01:12:26,863 --> 01:12:29,615
(dramatic music)

1151
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:40,585
Run, rabbit.

1152
01:12:40,626 --> 01:12:43,379
(dramatic music)

1153
01:12:48,217 --> 01:12:51,554
I can smell it. Come on, boy.
Oh yeah.

1154
01:12:51,596 --> 01:12:53,264
(dramatic music)

1155
01:12:53,306 --> 01:12:55,766
(dog whining)

1156
01:12:56,767 --> 01:12:59,770
(suspenseful music)

1157
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:12,950
Its' gonna be all right, boy.

1158
01:13:12,992 --> 01:13:16,579
Who the fuck did this? Who did
this?

1159
01:13:16,621 --> 01:13:19,624
(suspenseful music)

1160
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:28,132
I'm gonna fucking kill you.
You fucked with my dog.

1161
01:13:28,174 --> 01:13:30,927
(dramatic music)

1162
01:13:34,305 --> 01:13:35,556
- Frank? James?

1163
01:13:36,682 --> 01:13:39,435
(dramatic music)

1164
01:13:50,571 --> 01:13:51,781
- Kas, help me.

1165
01:13:54,909 --> 01:13:58,496
Let's hide. They're
gonna get us. Just hide.

1166
01:13:58,537 --> 01:13:59,914
- What do you mean hide? Let's
keep going.

1167
01:13:59,956 --> 01:14:04,502
- I'm not running no more.
Look, let's hide please.

1168
01:14:04,543 --> 01:14:06,379
Let's hide. Where are we gonna
go?

1169
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,880
- Let's go, we have to run!

1170
01:14:07,922 --> 01:14:10,174
(laughing)

1171
01:14:11,926 --> 01:14:15,096
- Darling, you gotta excuse my
friends.

1172
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:21,227
They can be a little
inappropriate

1173
01:14:22,478 --> 01:14:26,065
Me, I believe in the golden
rule.

1174
01:14:27,108 --> 01:14:29,110
You got to treat others like.

1175
01:14:32,655 --> 01:14:33,864
Well, you know the rest.

1176
01:14:41,122 --> 01:14:42,790
These are my woods.

1177
01:14:49,463 --> 01:14:51,507
You want to play with me?

1178
01:14:51,549 --> 01:14:53,592
(twig snaps)

1179
01:14:53,634 --> 01:14:55,052
Ooh.

1180
01:14:56,762 --> 01:14:59,640
Are we gonna have some fun with
you? Yeah.

1181
01:15:02,184 --> 01:15:05,563
We gonna skin us a little piggy
today.

1182
01:15:10,901 --> 01:15:12,153
You want to play with me?

1183
01:15:14,321 --> 01:15:15,406
I like games.

1184
01:15:16,449 --> 01:15:19,452
(suspenseful music)

1185
01:15:27,043 --> 01:15:30,254
(dramatic music)

1186
01:15:30,296 --> 01:15:35,301
- (squishing)
- (dramatic music)

1187
01:15:46,228 --> 01:15:47,813
- We should go over there.

1188
01:15:47,855 --> 01:15:51,400
There's a house or something.
I don't know. I see a house.

1189
01:15:51,442 --> 01:15:53,527
- Kassi.

1190
01:15:53,569 --> 01:15:56,530
It's just more, some more
fucking inbred hicks out here.

1191
01:15:56,572 --> 01:15:59,283
- Who you calling a crazy hick,
nigger?

1192
01:16:01,702 --> 01:16:03,662
- You, you fucking retarded ass
bitch.

1193
01:16:03,704 --> 01:16:04,872
You got us fucked up.

1194
01:16:04,914 --> 01:16:07,833
- (gun fires)
- (Kassi screams)

1195
01:16:07,875 --> 01:16:10,544
(Kassi gasping)

1196
01:16:12,755 --> 01:16:14,924
- She always run her mouth like
that?

1197
01:16:14,965 --> 01:16:17,176
How long you known her,
and never done that?

1198
01:16:17,218 --> 01:16:19,386
(dramatic music)

1199
01:16:19,428 --> 01:16:21,388
I told you, you was gonna lose.

1200
01:16:22,348 --> 01:16:23,349
Move.

1201
01:16:25,184 --> 01:16:26,727
Go!

1202
01:16:26,769 --> 01:16:28,270
Get moving, bitch.

1203
01:16:31,941 --> 01:16:34,485
Get down in the mud. You are
mud.

1204
01:16:34,527 --> 01:16:36,737
Get down, nigger lover. Get.

1205
01:16:38,739 --> 01:16:40,407
I said you'd be fucked either
way.

1206
01:16:41,492 --> 01:16:44,328
Get. Get. I said get.

1207
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:49,458
Get in the mud. Get down.

1208
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,501
Get. Get.

1209
01:16:51,919 --> 01:16:55,005
(grunting)

1210
01:16:55,047 --> 01:17:00,052
- (punches landing)
- (dramatic music)

1211
01:17:42,469 --> 01:17:44,805
(screaming)

1212
01:17:47,433 --> 01:17:49,518
- I was once like you.

1213
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:52,479
I used to wear the habit,
then they stole my dignity.

1214
01:17:52,521 --> 01:17:54,773
- Do you think this will
save you from being cast back

1215
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,859
to the pits of Hell, from which
you came?

1216
01:17:57,943 --> 01:17:59,904
Speak now, demon.

1217
01:17:59,945 --> 01:18:01,530
(Heather grunting)

1218
01:18:01,572 --> 01:18:04,200
- Isn't that what they did to
you?

1219
01:18:04,241 --> 01:18:07,786
Those people? The way you're
taught to fear everything?

1220
01:18:07,828 --> 01:18:09,205
(Heather grunting)

1221
01:18:09,246 --> 01:18:10,581
Let me help you.

1222
01:18:11,874 --> 01:18:13,667
Don't you want to avenge them?

1223
01:18:13,709 --> 01:18:16,253
They will just be more.

1224
01:18:16,295 --> 01:18:18,964
(somber music)

1225
01:18:28,766 --> 01:18:29,767
- Go.

1226
01:18:30,643 --> 01:18:33,312
(somber music)

1227
01:18:38,776 --> 01:18:41,195
(Eve crying)

1228
01:18:50,788 --> 01:18:54,083
(dramatic music)

1229
01:18:54,124 --> 01:18:55,918
- [Woman] Isn't it just so
peaceful?

1230
01:18:55,960 --> 01:18:58,045
- [Man] It really is, it really
is.

1231
01:18:58,087 --> 01:18:59,171
- It's so peaceful, you know.

1232
01:18:59,213 --> 01:19:00,256
- Thank you for bringing me.

1233
01:19:00,297 --> 01:19:01,632
- You gotta love the green.

1234
01:19:01,674 --> 01:19:04,301
- Gotta love the green, yeah.

1235
01:19:04,343 --> 01:19:05,469
Gotta love it.

1236
01:19:05,511 --> 01:19:07,096
- Are you fucking serious,
right now?

1237
01:19:07,137 --> 01:19:08,430
- What? What's wrong?

1238
01:19:08,472 --> 01:19:09,723
- You're gonna fucking
smoke that right now?

1239
01:19:09,765 --> 01:19:11,016
- Name a better time to get
high then now.

1240
01:19:11,058 --> 01:19:13,602
- What more could you need to
be relaxed?

1241
01:19:13,644 --> 01:19:16,814
- You do your yoga, your
breathing exercises to relax.

1242
01:19:16,855 --> 01:19:18,649
This is my breathing exercise.

1243
01:19:18,691 --> 01:19:20,818
- It's not the same. Nice try,
but not.

1244
01:19:20,859 --> 01:19:21,860
- Inhale, exhale.

1245
01:19:21,902 --> 01:19:23,570
- And what about the cops?

1246
01:19:23,612 --> 01:19:26,198
- I don't give a fuck about the
police.

1247
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:27,616
You know where I'm from?

1248
01:19:27,658 --> 01:19:28,867
Niggers die every day.

1249
01:19:28,909 --> 01:19:30,327
I don't give a fuck about the
police.

1250
01:19:30,369 --> 01:19:31,704
- What the fuck does that even
mean?

1251
01:19:31,745 --> 01:19:33,664
What the fuck does that even
mean?

1252
01:19:33,706 --> 01:19:35,958
- You ain't never gonna
understand what it means.

1253
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,584
- Yeah, just like you're never
gonna fucking listen to me.

1254
01:19:37,626 --> 01:19:39,003
(dramatic music)

1255
01:19:39,044 --> 01:19:41,922
- What the fuck? Yo, call
the cops. Call the cops.

1256
01:19:41,964 --> 01:19:44,633
Hold on. Yo, what the fuck.
What's the number to 911?

1257
01:19:44,675 --> 01:19:46,010
- Why are you a dumb ass?

1258
01:19:46,051 --> 01:19:49,346
- Look, who the fuck is this
bitch?

1259
01:19:49,388 --> 01:19:52,057
This is why I smoke weed,
and I don't fucking hike.

1260
01:19:52,099 --> 01:19:53,434
(sirens blaring)

1261
01:19:53,475 --> 01:19:55,436
- There go you're fucking cops,
tough guy.

1262
01:19:55,477 --> 01:19:56,478
- Fuck you.

1263
01:19:58,480 --> 01:19:59,857
You would have called the cops
too.

1264
01:19:59,898 --> 01:20:01,984
- Yeah, I would have. I'm white.

1265
01:20:02,026 --> 01:20:05,112
(sirens blaring)

1266
01:20:05,154 --> 01:20:07,656
- So before we get to how my
two deputies

1267
01:20:07,698 --> 01:20:10,409
ended up dead at old man
Jacob's place,

1268
01:20:10,451 --> 01:20:11,577
why don't you tell me

1269
01:20:11,618 --> 01:20:14,872
how this whole thing got
started, again?

1270
01:20:14,913 --> 01:20:17,041
- I just was trying to make
some money to pay my bills.

1271
01:20:17,082 --> 01:20:18,417
- Yeah, yeah yeah.

1272
01:20:18,459 --> 01:20:20,336
You and the other thousand
idiots that come up

1273
01:20:20,377 --> 01:20:23,047
through here every year, like
it's a fucking gold rush.

1274
01:20:23,088 --> 01:20:25,132
Okay so, this guy, Sasha.

1275
01:20:25,174 --> 01:20:28,385
You and your friends decided
to murder him and his crew.

1276
01:20:28,427 --> 01:20:29,928
Or how about this?

1277
01:20:29,970 --> 01:20:32,639
You guys decided to rob them,
and it all went to shit.

1278
01:20:32,681 --> 01:20:34,058
- I keep trying to tell you.

1279
01:20:34,099 --> 01:20:36,477
I didn't kill anybody,
and you're not listening.

1280
01:20:36,518 --> 01:20:40,856
- My two deputies and
that nice family? Dead.

1281
01:20:40,898 --> 01:20:43,025
All this murder taking place
around you,

1282
01:20:43,067 --> 01:20:44,443
and you're just an innocent
bystander.

1283
01:20:44,485 --> 01:20:47,237
- There was something,
someone in that house.

1284
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:50,616
And I think that's what was
trying to follow us, or kill us.

1285
01:20:50,657 --> 01:20:51,658
I don't know.

1286
01:20:53,452 --> 01:20:54,536
- All right, go on then.

1287
01:20:54,578 --> 01:20:56,330
Tell me how these other people
die.

1288
01:20:57,664 --> 01:20:59,124
What about the brothers,

1289
01:20:59,166 --> 01:21:01,460
down at the bottom of the
mountain near the meadow?

1290
01:21:01,502 --> 01:21:03,629
What did you do?

1291
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:05,130
What happened to them?

1292
01:21:05,172 --> 01:21:08,550
Well, first of all those
incestuous brothers

1293
01:21:08,592 --> 01:21:11,345
that fucked their sister,
or whatever they were,

1294
01:21:11,387 --> 01:21:13,889
they held a gun to us and they
tied us up.

1295
01:21:16,392 --> 01:21:18,268
That's when she shot Chris.

1296
01:21:20,020 --> 01:21:22,272
And I thought she was gonna
shoot me next.

1297
01:21:23,607 --> 01:21:25,859
And I held her under water.

1298
01:21:25,901 --> 01:21:28,028
And I held her, and I held her

1299
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:31,407
until she wasn't breathing
anymore.

1300
01:21:31,448 --> 01:21:34,410
Nobody else came, so I
just took off running

1301
01:21:34,451 --> 01:21:36,245
looking for help, and now I'm
here.

1302
01:21:38,914 --> 01:21:40,874
- Well, Kassi, you may not want
to tell me

1303
01:21:40,916 --> 01:21:42,209
everything that happened today,

1304
01:21:42,251 --> 01:21:44,795
but do you know what you
just did, Sweetheart?

1305
01:21:44,837 --> 01:21:46,213
- What?

1306
01:21:46,255 --> 01:21:47,798
- You just confessed to murder?

1307
01:21:49,007 --> 01:21:51,009
Murder is illegal in this
county,

1308
01:21:51,051 --> 01:21:53,512
on this mountain, and
in the good old US of A.

1309
01:21:53,554 --> 01:21:57,266
And I have you on first
degree murder charges.

1310
01:21:57,307 --> 01:21:59,268
So Sweetheart, you're gonna
need to do

1311
01:21:59,309 --> 01:22:01,186
a little bit of cooperating
if you want any kind of-

1312
01:22:01,228 --> 01:22:02,271
- It was self defense.

1313
01:22:02,312 --> 01:22:03,522
- Kassi.

1314
01:22:03,564 --> 01:22:05,107
- That bitch, she killed
two of my friends.

1315
01:22:05,149 --> 01:22:07,067
Everybody was trying to kill me
all night.

1316
01:22:07,109 --> 01:22:10,612
- Tell me who really sent you
here. Huh?

1317
01:22:11,905 --> 01:22:14,283
- I just want to speak to my
lawyer.

1318
01:22:14,324 --> 01:22:15,701
You have everything on tape.

1319
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:18,245
I want my phone call.

1320
01:22:20,372 --> 01:22:21,832
I'm not saying anything else.

1321
01:22:22,708 --> 01:22:23,709
- On tape?

1322
01:22:25,419 --> 01:22:26,837
Listen, honey.

1323
01:22:26,879 --> 01:22:29,173
I told you, you get one
chance to cooperate, right?

1324
01:22:29,214 --> 01:22:30,883
- I am cooperating.

1325
01:22:30,924 --> 01:22:31,925
- Really?

1326
01:22:31,967 --> 01:22:34,178
I tell you what.

1327
01:22:34,219 --> 01:22:36,847
We're gonna work on trying
to reduce your sentence here,

1328
01:22:36,889 --> 01:22:38,765
give you a little bit of
leniency.

1329
01:22:38,807 --> 01:22:40,976
I would take advantage
of that opportunity.

1330
01:22:42,686 --> 01:22:45,189
I'm the last law man
around here for 100 miles.

1331
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:47,858
You and your friends, you
killed my last two deputes.

1332
01:22:48,734 --> 01:22:50,444
You owe me, girly girl.

1333
01:22:50,486 --> 01:22:52,321
(suspenseful music)

1334
01:22:52,362 --> 01:22:53,363
- (chittering)
- (Kassi gasps)

1335
01:22:53,405 --> 01:22:55,532
What? What is this?

1336
01:22:55,574 --> 01:23:00,579
- (squishing)
- (dramatic music)

1337
01:23:02,456 --> 01:23:05,542
(eerie wind blowing)

1338
01:23:06,752 --> 01:23:09,838
(cell phone ringing)

1339
01:23:11,798 --> 01:23:13,091
- What was that?

1340
01:23:13,133 --> 01:23:15,719
- That's Kassi. She's just
checking in.

1341
01:23:15,761 --> 01:23:17,137
- Everything Okay?

1342
01:23:18,805 --> 01:23:20,599
- Yeah, everything's okay.

1343
01:23:20,641 --> 01:23:21,767
- She's always okay.

1344
01:23:31,151 --> 01:23:34,238
(upbeat party music)

1345
01:23:39,785 --> 01:23:42,412
- Hey girl. I was hoping you
would come.

1346
01:23:42,454 --> 01:23:43,747
Shit's about to get lit.

1347
01:23:43,789 --> 01:23:45,541
Did I tell you Mathew was a
producer?

1348
01:23:45,582 --> 01:23:46,792
And we can talk more

1349
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:48,710
about getting you that part or
something.

1350
01:23:48,752 --> 01:23:51,547
Or maybe you can hook up
with one of his friends.

1351
01:23:51,588 --> 01:23:53,840
Speaking about friends, who's
this?

1352
01:23:53,882 --> 01:23:57,219
- This is my new roommate,
Lilly.

1353
01:23:57,261 --> 01:23:58,220
She just moved out here.

1354
01:23:58,262 --> 01:23:59,429
- Well, welcome to Hollywood.

1355
01:23:59,471 --> 01:24:00,681

love it.
