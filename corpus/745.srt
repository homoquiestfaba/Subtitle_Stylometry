1
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,416
We're on the red carpet tonight
for the premiere of Adrenaline Force.

2
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,418
This is Bo Laramie's
breakout role...

3
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,462
in what is certain to become
a very popular action franchise.

4
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,631
Take a look at the crowd
behind me.

5
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:33,510
They have been completely ignited by
the anticipation of Laramie's arrival.

6
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,429
Oh, my God,
this is huge, babe.

7
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,431
It's a long way from
pounding nails in buildings.

8
00:01:37,556 --> 00:01:41,059
- Do you know all these people?
- No, son. I don't know any of 'em.

9
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:44,104
- I think they think they know you, Dad.
- Yeah, I think you're right.

10
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,107
Okay, honey, I want you to go
out there and have a good time.

11
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,235
- Okay. I love you.
- I'm proud of you. You've worked hard.

12
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,613
- Hey. You ready, Bo?
- Yeah. I'll see you guys in a little bit.

13
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:56,033
- Buddy, give me five. Huh?
- Go get 'em, Dad!

14
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,871
Whoa.

15
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,623
- Good luck tonight, Bo.
- Thanks.

16
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,167
Bo. Your first action film.
How are you feeling tonight?

17
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,169
Aw, man, this is
all new to me, you know.

18
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,713
I'm just... really just
trying to enjoy it. You know?

19
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,590
And, uh, I'm excited.
This is... It's unreal.

20
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,592
- Your fans are waiting. Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

21
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,644
Bo! Bo! Bo!
Hey, Bo, can you sign this?

22
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,896
- Right here?
- Thanks, man.

23
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,291
- Over here!
- Shake his hand! Shake his hand!

24
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,108
Whoa. What a night.

25
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,361
Unreal.

26
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:18,907
Six months ago, I couldn't get
arrested with a fresh corpse and a smoking gun.

27
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,827
And today I'm the, uh, "it" guy?

28
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,665
But you can't buy into that.
That's an illusion.

29
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,668
That's not real.

30
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,671
You know, there are
primitive tribes that believe...

31
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,508
you lose a piece of your soul
every time your picture's taken.

32
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,344
After last night,
it's a wonder I have any left.

33
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,972
- Bo Laramie.
- Hold that thought.

34
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:44,016
- It is!
- Oh, my God!

35
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,559
- That's him!

36
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:47,561
That never happened
in high school. Never.

37
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,439
That's an illusion.
It's not real.

38
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,441
Life is good.

39
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:54,860
I guess I'm just gonna
keep doin' what I'm doin'...

40
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,529
until somebody figures out
I really don't know what I'm doin'.

41
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,991
Yeah, you know, that makes sense.
That sounds like a plan.

42
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,893
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Dad.

43
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,937
- What's up?
- Mom says you run so you won't get fat.

44
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:15,399
- Is that true?
- Is that what she said? Really?

45
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,944
Well, you know what?
Your mother's right again.

46
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,072
That's it. Everything we have
fits in half a cabinet.

47
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,074
I love this house.

48
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,243
- You sure it's ours?
- It's ours, beautiful.

49
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,745
- It's ours.
- How was your run?

50
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,875
Good enough that the fat man and his family
can go get some muffins on the way to soccer.

51
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:36,295
- Muffins!
- Did you give our secret away?

52
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,380
- Yeah.
- No!

53
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,507
Okay, I'm gonna put you
in the cabinet.

54
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:46,221
- Hey, Bo.
- How are you, Sierra? What's goin' on?

55
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,265
- Hi, Zach.
- Hi, Sierra.

56
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,392
- Hi, Rusty.
- The usual?

57
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:53,103
You know what, give us three of the blueberry
and two coffees, will you please?

58
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:56,732
Sure. I saw this huge billboard
of you going up on Sunset.

59
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,442
- I know. It's wild, isn't it?

60
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,528
- Excuse me. You're Bo Laramie, aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.

61
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,030
- What's your name?

62
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:03,989
- What's your name?

63
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,950
- Oh, I'm Emily, from Ohio.
- Nice to meet you, Emily from Ohio.

64
00:06:07,034 --> 00:06:09,411
Thanks. Could I get
your autograph?

65
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,538
Yeah, absolutely.
Where would you like me to sign?

66
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,790
Right across your crotch
would be great.

67
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:20,172
Hey, Zach,
let's go, buddy.

68
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:25,552
- Where'd you get this?
- They just put 'em out at the grocery store.

69
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,347
- Thank you!
- Yeah.

70
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:31,016
Hold this, will you, bud?

71
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,685
- Just keep the change. Thank you, Sierra.
- Thanks.

72
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,687
- See ya.
- Bye, Sierra.

73
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,242
- We're naked. Can they do this?
- They did, Abby.

74
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:52,079
How dare they put Zach
on the cover of a magazine?

75
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:55,123
There are so many creeps out there.
I... He's a minor. Is this legal?

76
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,709
I'm gonna call Gill,
and I'm gonna find out. All right?

77
00:06:57,835 --> 00:07:00,128
God, Bo.

78
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,589
My principal, the teachers.

79
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,717
My kids' parents.
What are they gonna think?

80
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,719
I'm sorry you're being
put through this, Abby.

81
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:12,808
Why is Daddy in a magazine with
a black thing covering his pee-pee?

82
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,269
- You ready to play some soccer today, buddy?
- Yeah!

83
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,569
Here you go!

84
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,530
- How's it going, buddy?
- Great.

85
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,282
- Morning, guys.
- Good morning.

86
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,576
- Hey, listen. Thanks for those tickets.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

87
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:34,705
You got it, bro. All right, now.
Only one thing matters, right?

88
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,790
I know, Dad.
Have fun.

89
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,584
Okay.

90
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,053
I'll be right back, sweetie.

91
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,811
Hey.
How you doin', Bo?

92
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:00,189
All right.
What are you doin'?

93
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,608
I'm about to watch
a soccer game.

94
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,902
How's Zach doin' this morning?
He's a good-lookin' boy.

95
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,487
He's got a birthday comin' up,
doesn't he?

96
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,531
You want to take a picture of me?
I'm right here, okay?

97
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,659
Take a few shots. 'Cause you had
no right taking pictures of my son.

98
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,661
That's a point of law,
Mr. Laramie.

99
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,707
I have every right to take pictures
of whoever I want in a public park.

100
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,044
- Yes, I do.
- Not without my consent you don't, all right?

101
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,463
- Now, come on.
- Look. Things have changed.

102
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:26,465
You're somebody now.
You better get used to this.

103
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,009
- Oh, yeah? I'm somebody now?
- Yes, you are. You're somebody now.

104
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,595
- Now your game's about to start.
- It's a security risk.

105
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,431
I'm asking you nicely,
and I'm saying please.

106
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,433
Don't take pictures
of my son.

107
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,852
Okay. Okay.

108
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,188
- You got it, Bo.
- Thank you. I appreciate it.

109
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,398
I understand.

110
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,400
Sure thing, famous guy.

111
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:14,555
- Good job, buddy.
- You were awesome.

112
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,308
- Thanks, Mom.
- I'm proud of you, son. You did a great job, buddy.

113
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,060
You did a great job.

114
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,105
Son of a bitch.

115
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,191
Take him to the car.

116
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,902
Bo!

117
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,492
What did I tell you? I said don't take
another goddamn picture of my family.

118
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:38,912
- You understand that? Not one more.
- Yeah? Kid takes a nice picture.

119
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,999
Won't bring half as much as the ones I have
of Abby changing Zach's clothes.

120
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,084
The steamy ones... by the pool.

121
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:46,587
- Oh, yeah?

122
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:49,089
- Huh?
- Is that Bo?

123
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,761
Oh, are you gonna pay.

124
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:56,763
- Smile, Bo.

125
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:00,058
- You get that?

126
00:10:00,184 --> 00:10:03,729
- Ooh, in living color, chief.
- Cops are on their way.

127
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,315
- Bo!
- Hey, Bo.

128
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,609
Hey, big shot!

129
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:11,486
Enjoy what's left of your weekend.

130
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:15,574
Let's go make some money.

131
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,121
Oh, yeah? huh?

132
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,791
Wow. We're told Laramie was released
late Saturday afternoon...

133
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,294
ordered to attend
anger-management classes...

134
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,254
as part of a plea agreement.

135
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,090
His people tell us the assault charges
will likely be dropped...

136
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:34,593
in lieu of a settlement
that could easily cost...

137
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,221
the rising star
half a million dollars.

138
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,765
The victim, 34-year-old Rex Harper...

139
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,142
is also demanding a public apology.

140
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,228
Our very own Giuliana
caught up with Bo...

141
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,688
on the set of
his new action movie.

142
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:48,690
- Giuliana?
- Thanks, Patrick.

143
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,776
- And thank you for agreeing to sit down with me.
- Thanks for having me.

144
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,570
Bo, just so we understand
what happened...

145
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:56,156
you became angry
at some photographers...

146
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,867
after they were taking pictures of you
at a weekend soccer game?

147
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:01,578
Mr. Harper was
taking pictures of my son.

148
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,872
I politely asked him to stop,
and he didn't.

149
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:07,376
So you hit him?

150
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:11,713
Well, there's a little bit
more to it than that, but, yeah.

151
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:14,299
This guy is nothing
but a low-class parasite.

152
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,844
- Your parasite's right here.
- He's never gonna get an apology from me.

153
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:20,222
And if he knows what's good for him,
he'll stay away from me and my family.

154
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:22,683
- Can you believe this prick?
- Strong words.

155
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,601
Yeah.

156
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:27,521
Yeah. I gotta go.

157
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:33,443
Laramie, I'm gonna destroy your life
and eat your soul...

158
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:35,988
and I can't wait to do it.

159
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:56,049
Well, here's one for ya.
You're lucky.

160
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,635
Real lucky.

161
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,929
A judge orders me to spend
$400 an hour on therapy...

162
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:02,931
that I don't need,
and that makes me lucky?

163
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,560
You're lucky
you're not in jail.

164
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,104
You're not
in Montana anymore, Bo.

165
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:12,441
Anger management is not about
upgrading from a 20 to a 12-gauge.

166
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,068
- The point is...

167
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:17,696
you're carrying belief systems
from a previous life...

168
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:20,157
that don't fit
your new reality.

169
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,951
Some of your old values
may not be valuable anymore.

170
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,703
Not here, not now.

171
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,206
Well, I disagree.

172
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:30,167
You don't mess
with a man's family.

173
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,169
And I'm not gonna change
who I am...

174
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,756
to suit my environment
or your expectations.

175
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,925
I got to where I am
by doing things my own way.

176
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,135
Oh, I think the judge
would agree with you.

177
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:42,137
That's not what I meant, but...

178
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:44,723
No, I know that.

179
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,601
Look, your, uh...
your time here...

180
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:51,897
it's gonna give you the tools to better
deal with situations like last Saturday's.

181
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:55,734
And I'm considerably cheaper
than Mr. Harper.

182
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,988
- All right. Is that it?
- For now, yes.

183
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:04,201
And, uh, if you have a problem,
I want you to call me.

184
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,870
All right.

185
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,914
Thank you.

186
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,335
I'll see you next week.

187
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:19,091
Thanks, Phil.

188
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,553
Clear.

189
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,099
Must be cold as hell this time of year.

190
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,851
- Huh?
- Switzerland.

191
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,853
- What do you mean?
- It says here...

192
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:34,147
This came out of the U.K., so it must
be true..."Unnamed sources say...

193
00:13:34,273 --> 00:13:36,275
"Laramie chartered
a private jet to Switzerland.

194
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,694
"While there the young star reportedly
underwent a penile enhancement...

195
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,863
surprising his wife with it
on her birthday."

196
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,282
- Nice, huh?
- You give it a name? "Big Bo"? "The Albatross"?

197
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,284
- Something sexy for the bedroom, to keep it fun.
- I'm going to.

198
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:48,203
- Bo, can we get you for a lineup in here?
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no problem.

199
00:13:48,287 --> 00:13:49,955
- It's nice, how they caught me.
- Yeah.

200
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,375
- Y-You want to show it to me?
- Can't keep anything a secret these days.

201
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,169
You got the work done,
you might as well let people see it.

202
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,254
If it's big like that,
w-why would you want to hide it?

203
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,049
Be nicer to him. Things have changed
around here. Take a look.

204
00:14:06,263 --> 00:14:08,015
Oye.

205
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,392
Amigos.
You got the stuff, huh?

206
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,352
Sí.

207
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,563
Thank you.
Muchas gracias, amigos. Merci.

208
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,773
Sure, man.

209
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:22,070
- Pinche americano, está loco.
- Este buey está zafado.

210
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,458
Nice legs.
What time do they open?

211
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,669
Does that usually work
where you come from?

212
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:20,879
- Yeah, a couple of times.
- Leave!

213
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,549
Now!

214
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:29,054
- Can you believe that guy?
- I thought he was kind of cute.

215
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,098
Loser.

216
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:35,102
- And you're considering this?
- All I'm saying is they called.

217
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:39,189
Those schmucks over at Web Pics are turning
this friggin' business into a trout farm.

218
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:43,360
Celebrities getting approval over
paparazzi's photos? That's bullshit!

219
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:47,906
The public wants raw and real,
and that's what we give them.

220
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,992
Let me tell you something,
my friends.

221
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,994
We're the last of the real hunters.

222
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,454
I'll drink to that.

223
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:58,292
Like those shots you got of Lopez.
Now, they were the shit.

224
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,878
- And you are a dog.
- Damn straight. I made bank on 'em too.

225
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,046
I spent three nights
hidin' in that tree.

226
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:05,340
Ants crawlin' all over my ass.

227
00:16:05,424 --> 00:16:09,720
I picked her off with a thousand mil
from 120 yards out.

228
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,722
It was beautiful.

229
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,684
Yeah. Too bad
it wasn't really Lopez.

230
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,770
Nobody knows that.
Let me tell you something, Kevin.

231
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:21,607
Don't start sweatin'
the small stuff, okay?

232
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:25,569
Or you'll get soft, end up like the rest of
those pussies working at the agencies.

233
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,571
Hey, I'm here, ain't I?

234
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,240
Hanging with you and Rex,
who is, by the way, still the king.

235
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:34,745
Hundred and five thousand dollars
for that shot of Clooney in the woods.

236
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:36,747
Ohh-hoo.

237
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,458
Yeah, Clooney's been
a real gold mine.

238
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,085
- How'd it go, huh?
- She's a lesbian.

239
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,087
- Really?

240
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,840
I'm gonna get
a second opinion.

241
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,842
God, you get
a lot of lesbians.

242
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,220
- Let's go.
- Excuse me.

243
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,222
- Buy you another round?
- Yeah.

244
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,015
Hey, Dan... Dana.

245
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,893
- I guess you can afford it.
- What's that supposed to mean?

246
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,561
You think I wouldn't
recognize the guy...

247
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,813
that siphoned half a million dollars
out of Bo Laramie?

248
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:05,817
Hey, I saw you
get your ass kicked on TV.

249
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:08,654
Look,
I'm a photojournalist.

250
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:10,656
- I was doing my job.
- Mm-hmm.

251
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:14,159
I was assaulted,
and justice was served.

252
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,620
With the exception
of Laramie's apology to me.

253
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:20,541
I like reading the tabloids.
I think they're fun.

254
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:23,335
- I think you're drunk.
- I think you're cute.

255
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,505
Your pictures
hurt people.

256
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,841
Do they?
The irony...

257
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:31,468
- Marcy.
- Marcy...

258
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:36,265
is everyone wants to have steak,
but nobody wants to date the butcher.

259
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:41,937
My job is to provide
a window of reality for society.

260
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,148
It's up to them whether they want
to look through it or not.

261
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:48,026
Come on.
Have you ever bought a tabloid?

262
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:52,155
- Guilty as charged.
- Don't feel guilty. Guilty's bad.

263
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,157
I mean, everyone wants
to have a...

264
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:57,619
little peek, huh?

265
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:00,581
See?
It's human nature.

266
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,710
Look, there's a...
there's a premiere tonight...

267
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,337
and an after party
I'm covering.

268
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:08,422
Come with me, as my guest...

269
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:09,840
Come with me, as my guest...

270
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:13,177
and, um, see things
from an entirely different perspective...

271
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,179
mine.

272
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,639
Hey, do a shot with me
and then tell me your story.

273
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,766
I'm a good listener.

274
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:22,186
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

275
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:24,271
Listen to this...
No.

276
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:29,651
What do you say, Marcy?
You want to have a little adventure?

277
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,869
- It's beautiful. You should come and see it.
- Yeah?

278
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,455
So, when...
Saturday, can you come? Or...

279
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,208
- Saturday would be great.
- Hey, Bo. How's it going, mate?

280
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,668
- Good to see you again. Remember me?
- Good to see you.

281
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:49,254
London press junket.
You were sitting next to me in the pub.

282
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,257
There was that beautiful bird
on your lap and...

283
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,718
- Oh, sorry, man. Is that your wife?
- Get out of here.

284
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,970
- Sorry.
- Get out of here.

285
00:18:57,095 --> 00:19:00,933
- What the hell was that?
- Some jackass.

286
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:07,022
Hey. She bite?

287
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,816
- There's no way the little missus ignores that.
- Great. Let's roll.

288
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:12,110
Come on, let's go!

289
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,988
- Road trip.
- Wait! Aren't we going in?

290
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:28,794
You want to tell me
what's bothering you, honey?

291
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,630
I just think it's interesting,
that's all.

292
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:34,633
- You were in London last spring.
- Right.

293
00:19:34,758 --> 00:19:36,718
My girlfriends at home
get jealous...

294
00:19:36,802 --> 00:19:40,138
if somebody winks at their husband
at the company Christmas party.

295
00:19:40,264 --> 00:19:44,476
Half the civilized world
wants my husband.

296
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,562
How do you think
that makes me feel?

297
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:49,189
You know what that guy said tonight
is bullshit, right?

298
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:52,693
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay.

299
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:55,362
I guess it's all just new to me, you know?

300
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,823
It's new to me too, honey.
And I'm...

301
00:19:57,948 --> 00:19:59,867
You know, every day I'm learning.

302
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:05,914
Abby!

303
00:20:05,998 --> 00:20:09,376
- Bo! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!

304
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,920
- Look at me!
- Hey, Bo! Big shot!

305
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:14,006
- Look at me!
- I can't see a thing.

306
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:15,716
Bo! Bo!

307
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:17,801
Bo, slow down!

308
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,471
- Daddy!
- It's all right, son. It's okay.

309
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:23,724
Son of a bitch!

310
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:25,767
Takin' the front!

311
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,895
Okay, Leonard. Box him in.

312
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,573
- Hold on!

313
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,044
- Len! Come on. Let's go.

314
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,921
Come on. Come on.

315
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,514
Hello, sweetie.

316
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:48,934
Yeah, there's been a terrible accident
on, uh, 5th and Flower.

317
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:50,936
We need an ambulance.

318
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:04,408
Oh, yeah.

319
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,969
Hey, Marcy.
Hey, honey.

320
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:26,722
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?
Come on.

321
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:29,391
Everything's fine. There's an ambulance
on the way already.

322
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:32,269
They're not hurt that bad.
We'll go back on my boat and have a drink.

323
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,104
- Okay? I'll be right back.
- All right.

324
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,190
- Okay? Okay?
- Okay.

325
00:22:40,694 --> 00:22:43,739
Let's go. Clear out. We're finished here.

326
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,824
Go! Go! Go! Come on!

327
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,826
Go!

328
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,998
Hi.

329
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:38,710
How is she?

330
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:41,630
She's in recovery.
I had to remove her spleen.

331
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:50,180
The next few weeks will be very difficult, Bo.
She'll be in a lot of pain.

332
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:54,268
We'll manage that with medication,
watch her very carefully.

333
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:58,730
Now, let's talk about
your little guy here.

334
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:01,733
He's stable.
His vitals are good.

335
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:05,112
But comas are
a tricky thing, Bo.

336
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:07,781
All we can do is wait.

337
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,783
Okay.

338
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:15,914
- Can we be left alone?
- Absolutely.

339
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,500
Thank you, Doctor.

340
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:14,014
Daddy!

341
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:31,198
- You taped me?
- Mm-hmm.

342
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:33,408
The wine... You mu...
You must have put something in it...

343
00:25:33,492 --> 00:25:35,410
Obviously it made you
quite amorous.

344
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:38,914
It's a shame, Marcy,
you don't remember it.

345
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:42,960
Still going to the police to tell them who
caused Laramie's accident? Think again!

346
00:25:43,043 --> 00:25:46,296
Not only will I attach that
to every porno site on the Internet...

347
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:50,425
I will make sure it finds its way to
your father's desk at the State Department.

348
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:57,599
You wouldn't...
You wouldn't do that.

349
00:25:57,683 --> 00:26:01,228
You don't see my face on that screen.
Do you, Marcy?

350
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:05,649
Now go... go to the police! See if I'm bluffing!
Get out of my goddamn house!

351
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:07,651
Get out of here.

352
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:19,079
Hey there, little guy.

353
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:24,042
I'm gonna come back
and see you every day, okay?

354
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:32,217
It's okay, honey.
He can hear you, sweetie. All right?

355
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,303
Okay.

356
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:39,224
One second, honey.

357
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:42,060
I'm gonna go out and talk to
the detective. I'll be right back.

358
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:44,813
Honey, wake up and you can
have whatever you want.

359
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:48,650
- Hi, Bo.
- How are you, Detective?

360
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:53,280
I tracked down those paparazzi guys you
told me about. Brought 'em in one at a time.

361
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:56,033
- They all came up with the same story.
- Oh, yeah? What story's that?

362
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:58,702
Well, they never deny
following you.

363
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,704
They say they drove up
on the accident...

364
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,248
called 911 and never left
until help arrived.

365
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:05,667
Detective, that's bullshit.
You hear me?

366
00:27:05,751 --> 00:27:09,338
Come on, man.
Give me a break, will ya?

367
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:11,340
I'm just tellin' you what I got.

368
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:14,718
Until I find someone who saw
somethin' different, that's all I have.

369
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:17,387
What about the, uh, other driver?

370
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:22,643
He died late last night.
He never regained consciousness.

371
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:29,399
I'm sorry, Bo. But listen, if there's
a witness out there, I'm gonna find him.

372
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:31,610
Believe me.

373
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,570
I'm all over this one, Bo.

374
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,740
I appreciate it.

375
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,457
The victim died, Bo.

376
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:47,835
What now?

377
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:54,800
Did you mean to kill him, Bo?
Nice driving.

378
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,517
- Stellar Agency. Please hold.
- That's for pickup, Sara.

379
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:08,105
Bo, taking these paparazzi to court
is only gonna cause more headlines.

380
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:11,108
Let it go. We've got bigger
problems to deal with.

381
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:15,445
The studio says we get back to work or they
will be forced to shut down the picture.

382
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:18,490
Five weeks, Bo. They're losing
a tremendous amount of money.

383
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:22,035
The bond company is now threatening to
go after you. And your production company.

384
00:28:22,161 --> 00:28:24,830
Technically, you weren't hurt.

385
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:29,585
- What'd you say?
- Uh, Bo, you're upset.

386
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:34,631
You don't know shit.

387
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:38,510
I'm sorry.

388
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,436
So, what do you want us to do, Bo?

389
00:29:20,219 --> 00:29:22,095
And that's a cut. Excellent!

390
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:24,723
- Well done.

391
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,768
Whoo. Way to do it.
Way to do it.

392
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:29,520
- You all right?
- Yeah.

393
00:29:29,603 --> 00:29:31,522
All right.
That's a wrap, everybody.

394
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,607
We'll pick it up here
tomorrow morning.

395
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:35,859
What you got, Jay?

396
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:37,903
Just a bunch of crap.

397
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:43,242
Oh, man.
"Laramie's wife on drugs."

398
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,328
"Star too busy to notice."

399
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:49,289
Mr. Laramie?
I'm Reggie, Aegis Security.

400
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:52,376
- Hey, Reggie.
- The studio sent me to keep an eye on things.

401
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:55,546
I'll be on set for the rest of the show.

402
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:58,966
Well, I could use you.

403
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:13,564
- Hey, Bo. No soccer with Zach this mor...
- Hey.

404
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:17,818
- Oh, my God.
- No, that's okay.

405
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:19,862
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm so sorry.
- Sierra.

406
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:23,949
- I can't believe I just said that.
- Sierra, look at me. Sierra?

407
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:26,160
Zach will be fine, okay?

408
00:30:26,285 --> 00:30:28,162
- Okay.
- All right?

409
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:36,336
Goddamn it.

410
00:30:37,796 --> 00:30:39,464
Hey!

411
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,175
Hey!

412
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:47,389
What are you gonna do, hit me too?

413
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:54,104
Man.

414
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:26,595
Yeah. That's bullshit, man!

415
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:51,453
Yeah, Beverly Hills.

416
00:31:51,537 --> 00:31:53,872
Let me have the number for
a Dr. Jennifer Kelley, please.

417
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:06,260
- Whoa!

418
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:14,601
Hey!

419
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:17,479
- Help me!
- I'm comin', man. Hold on!

420
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:19,898
You got to help me. Please!

421
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,150
Laramie! Oh, God.

422
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:24,152
Help me! Hurry!

423
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:29,158
Hurry!

424
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:31,535
- I'm here.

425
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:34,288
- Sit up.
- Help me. Reach. Reach! Reach! Reach!

426
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:37,249
- Give me your hand.
- Hurry up.

427
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:39,668
- Give me your hand.

428
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,795
What are you trying to do,
kill me?

429
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,464
- Shut up and give me your goddamn hand!
- Damn! Oh, my God!

430
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:49,845
Help me! Please!

431
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:52,973
Hold on, man.

432
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:55,559
- Hurry!

433
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:59,980
Oh, God! You... You think we were up your
ass before? I'm gonna own you now, slick.

434
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:03,483
- What'd you say?
- Just pull me up!

435
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:04,943
Pull me up.

436
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:08,906
Come on. Pull me up. Hurry!

437
00:33:08,989 --> 00:33:13,702
Pull me up! Now! Now!

438
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,922
I'm startin' to feel much more
in control of my anger.

439
00:34:07,005 --> 00:34:09,883
Well, that's quite a leap in progress.

440
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:12,261
Especially considering your recent tragedy.

441
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:14,263
Yeah.

442
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:17,850
Well, I can't let the fact that
four paparazzis nearly killed my family...

443
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:19,852
affect my behavior, now, can I?

444
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:21,854
What do you mean by that, Bo?

445
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:25,858
Well, you asked me to work
on something, and, uh, I did.

446
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:29,069
Well, surely you must have
some feelings about what happened.

447
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:31,572
I feel cheated.

448
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,950
I'm angry.

449
00:34:38,162 --> 00:34:40,330
Blessed.

450
00:34:40,414 --> 00:34:42,416
All at the same time.

451
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:46,670
- What's this?

452
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:48,630
A journal.

453
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:52,676
I want you to start recording specific events
that prompt your anger...

454
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:54,803
and how you dealt with them
in the moment.

455
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:57,472
Doing this will help you
put a face on your problems.

456
00:34:57,556 --> 00:35:00,851
My problems already
have faces, Dr. Kelley.

457
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:03,270
Well, then you're moving
in the right direction.

458
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,108
Let this journal become
a sanctuary for you, Bo.

459
00:35:08,233 --> 00:35:10,486
My clients are having
great success with it.

460
00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:12,863
Really?

461
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:37,054
This shit happens way too often.

462
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,515
This kid never even hit the brakes.

463
00:35:39,598 --> 00:35:42,851
- This guy ain't no kid. He's close to 40.
- They call 'em Rolex riders.

464
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:45,854
They hang out in Beverly Hills,
wear expensive leathers.

465
00:35:45,938 --> 00:35:48,273
Same guy cuts all their hair.
Pity. He was cute.

466
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:51,735
Hey, fellas.
Detective Burton, S.I.S.

467
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:54,738
- You boys mind if I sniff around?
- Knock yourself out, Detective.

468
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:56,740
Hey, why's Special Investigations...

469
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:59,243
sending a D-2 down
to a traffic accident?

470
00:35:59,326 --> 00:36:01,745
Well, I heard your victim's name
on the radio.

471
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:04,206
He was part of a case
that I've been working on.

472
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:06,917
It's probably nothing.
I just thought I'd look around.

473
00:36:20,097 --> 00:36:21,974
Here you go, sweetie.

474
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:24,226
- Thank you.
- Sure.

475
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,647
- Anything else?
- Mm-mmm.

476
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,274
I'm fine.

477
00:36:30,399 --> 00:36:33,110
Okay.

478
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:37,156
One second.
All right?

479
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:49,668
- Hello.
- Oh, hi, Bo. It's Detective Burton.

480
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:51,837
- Hey, Detective.
- I hope I'm not bothering you.

481
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:54,631
No, no, no.
We just got back from the hospital.

482
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:56,842
- Any change?
- No, no. No change.

483
00:36:56,967 --> 00:37:00,345
But thanks for asking.
So, what's up?

484
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,140
Well, you remember that guy
Kevin Rosner?

485
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:05,767
He was killed earlier today
in a motorcycle accident.

486
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:09,521
The... The name
sounds familiar. Wh...

487
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:13,108
He was one of the photographers
that was involved in your accident.

488
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:16,862
Oh.
Well, that's too bad, isn't it?

489
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:18,947
I just thought you'd like to know.

490
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:21,366
Yeah, well, I appreciate you calling.

491
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:23,035
Okay.

492
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:55,692
Bo!

493
00:38:15,462 --> 00:38:18,382
All right.

494
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:20,425
Okay.

495
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:32,604
Chrissy!
Hey, baby.

496
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:42,948
Hey. What do you got?

497
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:45,367
Just like I expected. Cops refused
to release Kevin's personal effects.

498
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,662
- Then what are we doin'...
- Would you let me finish? I said I expected it.

499
00:38:48,787 --> 00:38:52,124
So I slapped 'em with a bogus power
of attorney. They didn't have any choice.

500
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:54,877
Ready for the good news?

501
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,462
Cheryl.
Do you mind, love?

502
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:04,219
Check this out.

503
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:08,098
Kevin!

504
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:10,642
Even in death,
they can't shut him up.

505
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:14,271
Hey, Cheryl. Call Richard.
Tell him to hold the cover.

506
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:20,986
Hello, Debra.
Can you get me through to Richard?

507
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:24,072
We got something here.
We need to speak with him now.

508
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:30,245
Bo?

509
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:32,247
- Bo! Howdy.
- Hey, Detective.

510
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:34,249
- How are you?
- Good. How you doin'?

511
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,835
Okay. Good to see you.
Yeah, things are good.

512
00:39:36,919 --> 00:39:39,838
- You want a cup of coffee?
- I'd love one. Thanks.

513
00:39:39,922 --> 00:39:42,966
- Let's take a walk. I'll show you around.
- Okay.

514
00:39:43,091 --> 00:39:47,012
Listen, the other day after I hung up with you
I did some digging around.

515
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:50,182
We're dealing with
real scumbags here, Bo.

516
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:51,934
This guy... Leonard Clark?

517
00:39:52,017 --> 00:39:54,436
He used to be an attorney.

518
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,606
He got himself disbarred
for distribution of narcotics.

519
00:39:57,689 --> 00:39:58,774
Is that right?

520
00:39:58,857 --> 00:40:01,777
What do you think
the son of a bitch does?

521
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,780
He turns around and sues the police
department for illegal search and seizure.

522
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:07,616
Cost the city a million bucks
just to make it go away.

523
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:10,744
He's still on probation for
possession of illegal firearms.

524
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:11,995
Really.

525
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,208
And this other guy... Harper?
The guy you slapped around?

526
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,961
He slimed his way out of
an attempted rape charge.

527
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:20,879
Guess who the attorney was.

528
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:22,881
- Leonard Clark?
- Yeah.

529
00:40:22,965 --> 00:40:25,884
And by the way, you're not
the first deep pockets he got into.

530
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:28,470
- This actor, Andy Baldwin?
- Alec?

531
00:40:28,554 --> 00:40:30,472
Yeah. One of
those Baldwin guys.

532
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:32,474
Anyway, he slaps Harper around.

533
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:34,476
Harper takes him to the cleaners...

534
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,396
and then Harper moves into
a boat in the marina.

535
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:40,315
Now, listen, Bo...

536
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:43,318
until I get this thing straightened out...

537
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:47,322
I know that you actors have people
and places you wanna keep confidential.

538
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:49,324
Right.

539
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:53,203
If I were you, I would be very careful
about what I said on my cell phone.

540
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:56,165
- Really. Why's that?
- Because for a couple hundred dollars...

541
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:59,001
you can go to
your local radio guy...

542
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:01,420
and you can drop in
on anybody at any time.

543
00:41:01,503 --> 00:41:04,339
- Bo, we're ready for you on set.
- Okay.

544
00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:07,342
Listen, Detective, thanks for coming by.
I appreciate it.

545
00:41:07,426 --> 00:41:09,887
I'll speak to you soon.
Okay? Thank you.

546
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,181
Thank you.

547
00:41:21,565 --> 00:41:23,942
I'm scared for Zach. I...

548
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:28,447
Part of me just wants to take him
back to Montana where he can feel secure.

549
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:30,949
I don't think
he's gonna get that here.

550
00:43:09,047 --> 00:43:12,634
- Hey, Reg. Where you at, man?
- Yeah, I just got here.

551
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:15,012
Nicole Kidman's
coming by for a lunch meeting.

552
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:17,014
- I'm on it.
- See you in a sec.

553
00:43:21,101 --> 00:43:24,062
You hear that, Leonard,
you piece of shit?

554
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:13,403
Sorry, man.
Can't let you slide.

555
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:15,948
- Mr. Laramie's orders.

556
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:18,158
- Do you mind?
- Yes, I do.

557
00:44:18,283 --> 00:44:20,410
- What's going on, Reg?
- Uninvited guest.

558
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:22,412
Oh, yeah?

559
00:44:22,496 --> 00:44:25,415
I don't see anybody hurt or naked.
You sure you're in the right place, Leonard?

560
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:27,459
Very funny.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

561
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:32,339
Get rid of him, Reg.

562
00:44:32,464 --> 00:44:35,092
- You heard him.
- Don't touch me!

563
00:44:35,217 --> 00:44:37,177
I'm leaving.

564
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:15,132
Emergency Response.

565
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:17,676
Listen, there's a guy with
a blue metallic Volvo station wagon...

566
00:45:17,801 --> 00:45:19,803
He's waving a gun
all over the place!

567
00:45:19,887 --> 00:45:21,805
- What is your location?
- Westbound on Sunset Boulevard!

568
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,348
We're coming up to Western now!

569
00:45:23,432 --> 00:45:27,186
His license number is ABM543.

570
00:45:27,311 --> 00:45:30,689
He's a white guy! He's crazy!
Get somebody down here!

571
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:38,155
All units, be on
the lookout for a blue Volvo wagon...

572
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:40,282
license Adam-Baker-Mary 543.

573
00:45:40,365 --> 00:45:42,284
Approach with caution.

574
00:45:42,367 --> 00:45:44,703
Driver has priors
for illegal weapons possession.

575
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:47,623
Last seen heading westbound
on Sunset near Western.

576
00:46:00,302 --> 00:46:03,514
- Pull over immediately!

577
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:05,557
- Pull your vehicle over!
- Oh, bollocks.

578
00:46:19,905 --> 00:46:23,033
- Do you wanna see a license?
- Show me your hands! Get your hands up!

579
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:25,202
- Do it now! Right now!
- What the hell is this?

580
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:27,162
Gun!

581
00:47:00,946 --> 00:47:04,408
And I'll let you stay up
as late as you want...

582
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:06,451
until 10:00.

583
00:47:11,665 --> 00:47:14,251
Do you want a new bike?

584
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:20,632
We need you to wake up.

585
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:26,388
One man is dead in what people are
describing as a bizarre "suicide by cop."

586
00:47:26,388 --> 00:47:30,392
One man is dead in what people are
describing as a bizarre "suicide by cop."

587
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:33,312
The victim, Leonard Clark,
pointed a weapon at several officers...

588
00:47:33,437 --> 00:47:35,314
who were forced to open fire...

589
00:47:35,439 --> 00:47:37,316
killing the man instantly.

590
00:47:37,441 --> 00:47:40,819
Details are still sketchy,
but police are describing the weapon...

591
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:43,322
as a modified.45-caliber blank gun...

592
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:45,866
commonly used
in the motion picture industry.

593
00:47:45,991 --> 00:47:48,368
We're awaiting a press conference
by the authorities...

594
00:47:48,494 --> 00:47:51,079
and we'll bring it to you live,
when it happens.

595
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:02,174
Hi. You've reached
Wendell Stokes Photography.

596
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:04,968
You got somethin' to say, say it.

597
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:07,471
Wendell, it's Rex. Pick up the phone!

598
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:10,474
Leonard's dead!
Pick up the phone!

599
00:48:18,565 --> 00:48:21,485
- It was Laramie, and I know it.
- Did you call Burton?

600
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:24,988
Yeah. Know what he said?
"The case is under investigation."

601
00:48:25,072 --> 00:48:27,991
Look, he's coming for us next, man.
You know that.

602
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:31,286
Yeah, but at least
we'll know when he's coming.

603
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:33,831
The cops don't
go after him, Wendell...

604
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:38,043
we will.

605
00:48:38,168 --> 00:48:40,546
- Did you get those from Rudy?
- Yep.

606
00:48:40,671 --> 00:48:43,507
Oh, these are beauties.

607
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,051
They'll transmit
to my system perfectly.

608
00:48:46,176 --> 00:48:48,554
H-How are we supposed to get in?

609
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:50,722
Have a little faith, my friend.

610
00:48:50,848 --> 00:48:54,935
Now, you would think
people would be more careful.

611
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:05,028
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Mm-hmm.

612
00:49:05,112 --> 00:49:07,489
If I don't feel well,
I'll have Ken cover my class.

613
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:11,368
Well, just call me and I'll have Reggie
pick you up if there's any problem.

614
00:49:11,451 --> 00:49:13,203
Shh! I'll be fine.

615
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:15,664
- Okay. All right.

616
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:17,833
I'll be with Zach all afternoon.

617
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:21,086
- I'll see you two for lunch at the hospital.
- Mm-hmm.

618
00:49:23,422 --> 00:49:25,299
- I love you, beautiful.
- I love you too.

619
00:49:25,424 --> 00:49:28,051
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

620
00:49:40,522 --> 00:49:42,941
- How's Zach?
- He's still in stable condition.

621
00:49:43,025 --> 00:49:44,943
- Thanks for asking.
- That's good news, Bo.

622
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:47,946
- What you got?
- It might be a while. We're running a little behind.

623
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:50,949
I have script changes for you,
and there's a Detective Burton here.

624
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:54,286
- I told him he could wait in your trailer.
- He's in my trailer? Thanks.

625
00:49:57,498 --> 00:49:59,082
- Oh, hiya, Bo.
- Hey.

626
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:02,252
- That little girl outside, she said it was okay...
- No, no, of course.

627
00:50:02,377 --> 00:50:05,088
- How's it going?
- Oh, good.

628
00:50:05,172 --> 00:50:07,883
Geez, look at this place.
It's amazing.

629
00:50:07,966 --> 00:50:09,885
My kids will not believe this.

630
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:11,887
- You got kids, huh?
- Yeah.

631
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:14,306
- Really? How many kids you got?
- Six girls.

632
00:50:14,431 --> 00:50:16,934
- Six girls? Wow.
- I kept trying for the boy, but...

633
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:19,561
It sounds like it.

634
00:50:19,645 --> 00:50:23,273
- Well, I guess you know why I'm here, Bo.
- It's pretty hard to miss.

635
00:50:23,398 --> 00:50:26,944
- So you know what I'm talking about?
- Leonard Clark, no?

636
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,239
Can you believe this guy?

637
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:33,242
He pulls a gun
on half of our department.

638
00:50:33,325 --> 00:50:35,327
- Well, the guy's a bit of a jerk. Come on.
- Hey.

639
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:37,996
- Sorry to interrupt, Bo.
- No, it's all right.

640
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:41,583
Okay, here you go, Detective. This is a copy
of the paperwork we gave to the A.T.F.

641
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:44,670
Well, thank you, Charlie. Thank you
very much. I'll stop by on my way out.

642
00:50:44,795 --> 00:50:46,505
All right.

643
00:50:49,842 --> 00:50:53,470
Oh, yeah, we traced the gun here.
Charlie reported it missing.

644
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:57,182
You know Leonard Clark
was here that day, right?

645
00:50:57,266 --> 00:50:58,976
I heard that.

646
00:51:00,185 --> 00:51:02,020
Bo...

647
00:51:02,146 --> 00:51:04,022
I've now got two
dead paparazzi...

648
00:51:04,148 --> 00:51:06,358
that were involved
in your accident.

649
00:51:06,483 --> 00:51:10,445
I wish I could tell you more
about these clowns. It's...

650
00:51:10,529 --> 00:51:13,657
I don't know, it just takes
a certain kind of person...

651
00:51:13,782 --> 00:51:16,326
that would do something like this.

652
00:51:19,872 --> 00:51:23,333
Complete and utter distortion
of the truth.

653
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:28,380
Welcome to my world, Detective.

654
00:51:30,674 --> 00:51:33,010
I'll tell you, Bo...

655
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:37,389
I don't know what I would do
if anyone ever hurt one of my family.

656
00:51:41,268 --> 00:51:44,354
I'm running up against it
on this one, Bo.

657
00:51:44,438 --> 00:51:46,398
What do you think?

658
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:52,488
I think you're dealing with a random
accident and a suicide. That's what I think.

659
00:51:53,989 --> 00:51:56,909
Well, as it turns out...

660
00:51:56,992 --> 00:51:59,203
Rosner's accident
might not be that random.

661
00:51:59,328 --> 00:52:01,538
The investigators
are still looking into it.

662
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:04,541
And now...

663
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:06,835
I've got this gun.

664
00:52:06,919 --> 00:52:10,047
Excuse me one second.

665
00:52:12,925 --> 00:52:15,844
Excuse me, Bo.
Paul sends his apologies.

666
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:18,847
- That's okay. How soon until I'm up?
:00 tomorrow morning.

667
00:52:18,931 --> 00:52:21,391
10:00 tomorrow?
All right. Thanks, sweetie.

668
00:52:21,475 --> 00:52:23,393
If that's it,
I'm gonna head home.

669
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:25,729
- Hey, I'm done here.
- Okay.

670
00:52:27,689 --> 00:52:31,235
Oh, Bo, there is one thing,
and I hate to ask.

671
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,238
Would you sign a picture
for my kids?

672
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:36,281
- Of course.
- If it's not too much trouble.

673
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:38,450
- Let me just grab a pen.
- Here.

674
00:52:38,575 --> 00:52:40,869
- Why don't you use this?
- Fine.

675
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,705
Thank you.

676
00:52:55,467 --> 00:52:57,427
There you go.

677
00:52:58,512 --> 00:53:00,264
- Thanks.
- Sure.

678
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:40,364
Maybe it's for one of us!

679
00:54:45,953 --> 00:54:47,538
- Bo!
- Abby!

680
00:54:47,663 --> 00:54:50,082
Bo!

681
00:54:50,207 --> 00:54:52,709
- Help me!
- Abby!

682
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,096
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Wendell!

683
00:55:05,722 --> 00:55:07,683
What the hell are you doing?

684
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:10,519
- Oh! It's Laramie.

685
00:55:11,937 --> 00:55:13,772
Come on!

686
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:17,776
You say one word to the cops,
and I'm coming back for the kid.

687
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:20,279
Abby?

688
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:22,739
Okay.

689
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:29,163
They said
that if we told anybody...

690
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:33,458
that... they said they'd hurt Zach.

691
00:55:33,584 --> 00:55:36,253
They're never gonna stop, Bo.

692
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:39,256
- They're never gonna stop.
- It's okay, baby.

693
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:41,258
I'm here, honey. I'm here.

694
00:55:43,343 --> 00:55:45,637
- Aegis Security.

695
00:55:45,762 --> 00:55:48,640
Hey, Reg, listen,
I need you to do me a favor.

696
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:51,643
I need you to go down to the hospital
and keep an eye on Zach tonight.

697
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:54,646
- Hospital? Is Zach okay? What's going on?
- Hey, Reg. Reg.

698
00:55:54,771 --> 00:55:56,648
I'll fill you in later. Okay?

699
00:55:56,773 --> 00:56:01,487
Just make sure that nobody goes inside
of that room unless they're a doctor.

700
00:56:01,612 --> 00:56:04,198
- It's done.
- If there's any problems, you call me.

701
00:56:04,323 --> 00:56:06,200
- All right.
- All right. Thanks.

702
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:09,203
She's gonna be fine, Bo.
I gave her something to help her rest.

703
00:56:09,328 --> 00:56:11,413
- Is there anything I should do?
- No, no, no.

704
00:56:11,497 --> 00:56:14,416
Just let her rest. She'll sleep
a good 12 hours or more.

705
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:17,419
- I'll call tomorrow, see how she's doing.
- All right.

706
00:56:17,503 --> 00:56:20,422
Listen, I appreciate you coming by.
Thank you.

707
00:56:20,506 --> 00:56:23,425
- But if there's a change, I want to know.
- You got it.

708
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:25,427
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

709
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:27,804
How you doing, fellas?

710
00:56:27,888 --> 00:56:30,933
How you doing, Mr. Laramie?
I'm Deputy Walker. This is Deputy Wilson.

711
00:56:31,016 --> 00:56:33,477
Det. Burton said you might
need some extra security.

712
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,521
Just until things settle down.

713
00:56:35,646 --> 00:56:38,023
- I appreciate you guys coming out.
- Happy to do it.

714
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:40,818
We're gonna be out here all night,
walk the perimeter every hour.

715
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:43,862
- Wife never got a look at the guy, huh?
- Nah, she didn't.

716
00:57:07,553 --> 00:57:10,639
So, what's the plan? I know
you got something up your sleeve.

717
00:57:14,393 --> 00:57:17,729
The idea of going in there,
Wendell...

718
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:20,023
was to protect ourselves.

719
00:57:20,149 --> 00:57:25,362
If we were worried Laramie was coming
after us before, we have guaranteed it now.

720
00:57:26,655 --> 00:57:28,574
Why don't we just call the cops?

721
00:57:28,657 --> 00:57:31,577
And tell them...

722
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:33,704
we broke into his house...

723
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:36,206
you attacked his wife...

724
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:40,252
and that we would like
some protection?

725
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:42,254
You're a moron, Wendell.

726
00:57:42,337 --> 00:57:44,256
You're an absolute moron!

727
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:47,217
What did you expect me to do?
The bitch was all over me.

728
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:49,344
Go home!

729
00:57:49,428 --> 00:57:52,347
Check your monitor.
See if Laramie's found the cameras.

730
00:57:52,431 --> 00:57:54,349
I gotta think this through.

731
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:56,602
Go home.
I'll call you later.

732
00:58:09,615 --> 00:58:11,867
- What's up with the light?
- Gonna have to see some I.D.

733
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:14,953
- Ain't that big-ass sign enough I.D. for you?
- Let's go.

734
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:18,373
- License and registration.
- What, I look like a terrorist?

735
00:58:18,457 --> 00:58:21,376
- Just the I.D., please.
- It's right there. There you go.

736
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,378
Only black man in Malibu.

737
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:27,382
Guys always messin' with me.
Always messin' with me.

738
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:31,595
- What'd you say?
- I said, 30 minutes or it's free.

739
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,639
Go on.

740
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:37,643
- The money better all be there, or that's your ass.
- Move on.

741
00:58:37,768 --> 00:58:40,103
I'm goin'.
Not waitin' for y'all.

742
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:52,115
- What's going on, man?

743
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:53,784
You!

744
00:58:53,909 --> 00:58:56,829
- Yo, you Bo, right? You Bo, right?
- Yeah.

745
00:58:56,912 --> 00:58:58,956
This your crib!

746
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,333
Yeah. What do I owe you
for the pizza?

747
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:03,293
You don't owe me nothin'.

748
00:59:03,377 --> 00:59:07,297
Just send down one of them bad white bitches,
and you can have all the pizza you want.

749
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:10,217
All right, tell you what.
Here's $60.

750
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:12,219
- All right?
- Yo, thanks a lot, man.

751
00:59:12,344 --> 00:59:14,221
The front door's open.

752
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:17,224
Put one pie inside, the other one
to the cops out front, will you, please?

753
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:20,144
- Have a good night.
- Good lookin' out!

754
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:20,329
Yeah, it's Burton. How's Vic comin'
with that Leonard Clark tape?

755
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,751
No kidding.

756
01:00:25,876 --> 01:00:28,837
- Tell him to cue it up. I'll be right in.

757
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:35,427
There you go, chief.

758
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:37,429
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

759
01:00:37,513 --> 01:00:39,765
- Can I get a copy of this?
- Copy?

760
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:42,226
I can give it to you on DVD.

761
01:00:47,606 --> 01:00:49,900
I'm gonna go wake up Laramie.

762
01:01:20,722 --> 01:01:23,767
Hi.
You've reached Wendell Stokes Photography.

763
01:01:23,892 --> 01:01:26,603
You got somethin' to say, say it.

764
01:01:26,728 --> 01:01:29,773
Wendell. Rex. I got a plan.

765
01:01:29,898 --> 01:01:32,943
I'll be at your place at 8::00 a.m. sharp.
Keep an eye on those cameras.

766
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:35,946
And call me if he leaves his house.

767
01:01:55,549 --> 01:01:58,594
- Hey, Wendell.

768
01:02:00,345 --> 01:02:03,807
What the hell are you doing here?

769
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,826
Aw, shit.

770
01:02:24,411 --> 01:02:26,371
Wait a minute.

771
01:02:53,273 --> 01:02:56,360
- This is Burton. Get me Traffic.

772
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:25,782
- Morning.
- Good morning.

773
01:04:25,866 --> 01:04:28,243
Listen, fellas, thanks for helping out.

774
01:04:28,327 --> 01:04:32,080
Brought you some hot coffee
and a dozen doughnuts to start your day.

775
01:04:32,164 --> 01:04:35,626
- Great.
- Appreciate it, Detective.

776
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:38,462
- You fellas get some rest.

777
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:16,458
- Hey, Detective.
- Good m...

778
01:05:18,418 --> 01:05:20,337
How did you know it was me?

779
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:23,173
'Cause, uh, I can see your car.

780
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:25,843
I-I'll let you in.

781
01:05:29,888 --> 01:05:32,349
Hey. You caught me.
I was in the shower.

782
01:05:32,432 --> 01:05:35,519
- How did my guys do last night? Were they okay?
- They were great.

783
01:05:35,602 --> 01:05:38,522
- I got a great night of sleep thanks to them.
- Glad to hear it.

784
01:05:38,605 --> 01:05:42,526
I got something I'd like you to
take a look at. It'll only take a minute.

785
01:05:42,609 --> 01:05:45,737
- Is everything all right?
- Great.

786
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:52,327
What is this?

787
01:05:53,662 --> 01:05:55,581
Impound found
some video equipment...

788
01:05:55,664 --> 01:05:57,583
in the back of Leonard's car.

789
01:05:57,666 --> 01:06:01,628
Seems he was wearing a miniature camera
when he came to the set.

790
01:06:06,425 --> 01:06:08,343
Why are we watching this?

791
01:06:08,427 --> 01:06:12,055
Oh, just be patient.
Best part is the end.

792
01:06:31,783 --> 01:06:34,411
Okay, now...

793
01:06:34,495 --> 01:06:36,538
watch this very closely.

794
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:40,918
There.

795
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:44,463
It's a jacket.

796
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:47,716
And there was something
about that jacket...

797
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:50,385
that was bothering me.

798
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:53,263
And then it hit me.

799
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:56,558
The boys at the crime lab
prepared this for me.

800
01:06:56,642 --> 01:06:59,603
Now, you'll notice
that in the first shot...

801
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:03,065
the lapels are facing away from us.

802
01:07:03,148 --> 01:07:05,067
In the second shot...

803
01:07:05,150 --> 01:07:08,570
the lapels are facing towards us.

804
01:07:10,072 --> 01:07:11,990
And?

805
01:07:12,074 --> 01:07:16,453
I was wondering how the jacket
removed itself from its hook...

806
01:07:16,537 --> 01:07:18,622
and turned itself around.

807
01:07:18,747 --> 01:07:23,293
You see, the button-cam is all one shot...
it's unedited, uninterrupted.

808
01:07:23,377 --> 01:07:27,172
And Leonard left his car
and came back only once.

809
01:07:28,549 --> 01:07:30,509
You know what I think?

810
01:07:31,593 --> 01:07:33,512
I think someone on that set...

811
01:07:33,595 --> 01:07:35,514
planted the gun.

812
01:07:36,974 --> 01:07:40,352
Excuse me.

813
01:07:43,939 --> 01:07:45,899
- Burton.

814
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:50,529
I'm on my way.

815
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:52,656
You don't want your disc?

816
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:54,658
Keep it.
We got the original.

817
01:09:38,804 --> 01:09:41,390
Ma'am, my name
is Detective Burton.

818
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:43,392
I'm from the Los Angeles
Police Department...

819
01:09:43,475 --> 01:09:46,895
and I'm here to talk to you
about the night of April 18.

820
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:34,943
They lied to you, Detective.

821
01:10:36,528 --> 01:10:39,031
They caused
the accident that night.

822
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:44,036
Then why the hell didn't you
come forward with this information before?

823
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:50,709
This is Detective Burton.

824
01:10:50,792 --> 01:10:54,129
I need two units to pick up Rex Harper
on suspicion of rape.

825
01:10:54,213 --> 01:10:57,007
Berth 40, slip seven at the marina.

826
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:59,676
The suspect is a white male,
about six feet tall.

827
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,596
And I also need a patrol car to meet me
at the home of Wendell Stokes...

828
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:05,390
1323 Old Malibu Road.

829
01:11:05,516 --> 01:11:07,392
Both units are code two.

830
01:11:07,518 --> 01:11:09,394
Roger that, Detective.

831
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,397
Units already dispatched
to both those locations...

832
01:11:12,523 --> 01:11:14,483
responding to
anonymous 9-1-1 calls.

833
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:19,363
10-4.

834
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,875
What the...

835
01:11:40,092 --> 01:11:42,094
Laramie.

836
01:12:20,299 --> 01:12:23,260
I want all of this glass
bagged up, Jerry.

837
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:25,804
- What do you got, Tim?
- Hey.

838
01:12:25,888 --> 01:12:28,807
Looks like the perp
came through the window.

839
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:31,059
We got a bloody handprint
on the wall.

840
01:12:31,143 --> 01:12:33,812
Blunt force, trauma to the head,
no sign of a struggle.

841
01:12:33,937 --> 01:12:35,814
Haven't found a weapon yet.

842
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:38,108
Guy's a bit of a freak, huh?

843
01:12:47,326 --> 01:12:49,745
What's this?

844
01:12:49,828 --> 01:12:52,289
This is a live feed
into Laramie's house.

845
01:13:00,130 --> 01:13:02,466
And that's Rex Harper.
Press that record button.

846
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:05,677
Call the Malibu Sheriff s Department. Tell 'em
to meet me at Laramie's house with backup!

847
01:13:05,802 --> 01:13:08,972
- Code three! Did you hear me?
- Yeah!

848
01:13:28,033 --> 01:13:31,036
Come on, pick it up!

849
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:34,414
Come on, Laramie!

850
01:13:53,058 --> 01:13:55,185
Took the bait, huh, Rex?

851
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:57,980
Answer the damn phone!
Come on!

852
01:14:02,526 --> 01:14:04,236
You know what, Rex?

853
01:14:04,361 --> 01:14:05,737
- Rex.
- Huh?

854
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:08,407
This feels a lot better than I thought.

855
01:14:08,532 --> 01:14:11,368
Ohh!

856
01:14:15,914 --> 01:14:17,708
Hello?

857
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,710
- Laramie, it's Burton.
- Detective?

858
01:14:19,793 --> 01:14:21,712
- Harper's on your property with a gun.
- He is?

859
01:14:21,795 --> 01:14:25,591
Yes, he is! Just find a way out!
I'm on my way!

860
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:28,719
Hurry, Detective! He's in!

861
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:31,096
- Laram...

862
01:14:31,221 --> 01:14:33,390
- Talk to me!
- Hurry! He's in!

863
01:14:33,474 --> 01:14:37,102
What the hell is going on? Laramie? Laramie!

864
01:14:37,227 --> 01:14:39,229
Damn it!

865
01:14:46,278 --> 01:14:49,281
You're in a lot of trouble, Rex.

866
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:51,783
The bat was a nice touch, wasn't it?

867
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:53,869
You're going down
for Wendell's murder.

868
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:56,205
- You can't do th... Ohh!
- What can't I do?

869
01:14:58,373 --> 01:15:01,418
Ooh, the cops are here.

870
01:15:02,503 --> 01:15:04,796
Okay. Okay.

871
01:15:04,922 --> 01:15:07,549
Gotta make this right. Yeah. Okay.

872
01:15:11,512 --> 01:15:15,766
This worked out so perfect, Rex. I don't
think I could've written it any better myself.

873
01:15:15,891 --> 01:15:18,811
It's just a shame I can't tell anyone.

874
01:15:18,894 --> 01:15:21,313
Except you.
I can tell you, can't I, Rex?

875
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:25,609
I feel like I can share anything with you.
I feel the need to share.

876
01:15:25,692 --> 01:15:27,611
Bo!

877
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:30,155
In here, Detective! Upstairs!

878
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:33,200
You ready for
the last act, Rex? Huh?

879
01:15:36,829 --> 01:15:39,498
Thank God.
Detective, thank God you called me.

880
01:15:39,623 --> 01:15:41,250
You... You saved my life.

881
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:43,502
Wait a second! He's the one...

882
01:15:43,627 --> 01:15:46,630
I owe you one.
He almost killed me.

883
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:49,967
Come on, now, Bo.
Give me the gun.

884
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:51,927
Take it easy. Okay?
It's over.

885
01:15:53,887 --> 01:15:57,307
- Just put the gun down.
- Okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

886
01:15:57,391 --> 01:15:59,810
Come on.

887
01:15:59,893 --> 01:16:02,187
- Yeah.

888
01:16:08,277 --> 01:16:11,196
Get this piece of shit
out of my house.

889
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:24,710
All right, come on. Get up.

890
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:27,880
Come on. Get up!

891
01:16:28,005 --> 01:16:30,465
Cuff this moron.
Get him out of here.

892
01:16:39,683 --> 01:16:41,560
Okay.
Okay, okay.

893
01:16:41,685 --> 01:16:43,896
- Oww!
- Photographer, my ass.

894
01:16:45,731 --> 01:16:48,609
Hey. I'll be out in a week.

895
01:16:48,734 --> 01:16:51,111
Just another great story
for Rex Harper.

896
01:16:51,236 --> 01:16:54,323
In a week you'll be somebody's wife.
Come on.

897
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:56,408
Hey, Russell, come on.

898
01:17:05,584 --> 01:17:07,753
Mr. Harper,
what were you doing here?

899
01:17:07,878 --> 01:17:12,049
- Any response to the rape allegations?
- Were you and Wendell lovers?

900
01:17:12,132 --> 01:17:15,219
- Did you kill Kevin Rosner?
- What about Wendell Stokes?

901
01:17:24,186 --> 01:17:26,438
- Give us a sound bite!
- All right, we're comin' through!

902
01:17:26,563 --> 01:17:28,357
Let me through.

903
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:30,442
Get out of my way!

904
01:18:08,147 --> 01:18:11,108
He's on his last shot. I'm headed
towards him now. Can you hang on?

905
01:18:12,151 --> 01:18:14,278
Bo. Hospital.

906
01:18:15,445 --> 01:18:18,073
This is Bo.

907
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:26,915
Hi, Daddy.

908
01:18:26,999 --> 01:18:29,918
Oh, my boy!

909
01:18:31,336 --> 01:18:33,463
- Hello, son.
- Hi, Daddy.

910
01:18:33,589 --> 01:18:36,133
Hi!

911
01:18:43,807 --> 01:18:46,602
- I missed you, buddy.
- I missed you too.

912
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:15,839
- Bo Laramie!
- Hey, Matthew.

913
01:19:15,964 --> 01:19:18,217
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

914
01:19:18,342 --> 01:19:20,844
Good to meet you, man.
Hey, meet my family. This is my wife Abby.

915
01:19:20,928 --> 01:19:22,805
Abby? Matthew.

916
01:19:22,888 --> 01:19:26,225
- My son Zach.
- What do you say, Zach? Proud of your dad, huh?

917
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:29,520
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, yeah? All right.

918
01:19:29,603 --> 01:19:31,188
- Keep up the good work.
- I will.

919
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:35,025
Nice to meet y'all. Zach, take care of them.
Y'all have a good night.

920
01:19:35,108 --> 01:19:36,860
- Ready, Bo?
- Yeah, yeah.

921
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:39,863
- All right, son, I'm gonna go take some pictures.
- Okay!

922
01:19:39,947 --> 01:19:42,074
Sweetheart, see you in the car.

923
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:44,701
Little baby girl.
See ya, honey.

924
01:19:44,827 --> 01:19:46,370
Beautiful.

925
01:19:46,495 --> 01:19:48,413
- Are you ready, honey?
- Yeah.

926
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:50,499
Okay. This way.

927
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:09,560
I love you, Bo!

928
01:20:09,685 --> 01:20:11,270
- Bo!
- Come on, Bo! Big smile!

929
01:20:15,149 --> 01:20:17,693
Bo! Over here, man!
Turn around! Turn around!

930
01:20:17,776 --> 01:20:20,362
Hey, Bo!

931
01:20:20,445 --> 01:20:23,407
Packin' on a few pounds
there, Laramie?

932
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:29,246
As a matter of fact, I am.

933
01:20:29,329 --> 01:20:31,415
Looks good on me, doesn't it?
