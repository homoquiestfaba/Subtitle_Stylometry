00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,402
"eva knew this might be

3
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:37,472
The last time
She saw him...

4
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,671
The last time she saw

5
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:41,873
The man
Who had stolen her heart."

6
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,639
[sighs]

7
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:50,477
Oh, eva,
You're killing me.

8
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,516
[phone buzzes]

9
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,798
[♪♪]

10
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:06,395
Ah! Gabriel august.

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,130
I've already
Pre-ordered my copy.

12
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,465
I know! I set aside
That whole weekend

13
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,870
Just to read it.

14
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,601
I'm almost as excited
About the new book

15
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:14,606
As i am about
Seeing his face.

16
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:17,178
I bet
He's so handsome.

17
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:19,848
[they sigh]

18
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,746
I can't do it.

19
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,122
I can't let the world know
That i'm gabriel august.

20
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,121
It's part of
The deal, liam.

21
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:29,622
You knew that
When you signed.

22
00:01:29,623 --> 00:01:30,923
Yeah, but i never thought
The first book

23
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,285
Would actually be
Successful.

24
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,663
[laughs] i did!

25
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:35,091
Didn't i tell you it
Would be a best-seller?

26
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:37,396
I just assumed you were
Being nice.

27
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:39,258
I've known you
Since you were born.

28
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,666
I don't need to make nice.

29
00:01:40,668 --> 00:01:42,698
You can't stay
Anonymous forever.

30
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,403
Readers form connections
With the books they love.

31
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:48,336
They want a relationship
With the author.

32
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:49,412
You're a success, liam!

33
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,610
Why can't you embrace it?

34
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,713
The manuscript
For your next book is due,

35
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:57,145
And i haven't seen
Any chapters.

36
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:58,621
Oh...

37
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,889
I've written plenty of
Chapters,
And then...

38
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:02,888
Promptly
Thrown them in the trash.

39
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,390
Well,

40
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:08,091
You are gonna have to find
The inspiration somewhere,

41
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,895
Because you still owe
Harris-kingsfield two books.

42
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:12,558
You're sure there's no way
We can just get 'em

43
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,226
To postpone the whole
Gabriel august reveal?

44
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:17,636
It's been almost impossible
Holding them off this long.

45
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:18,738
It's time.

46
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,469
Why don't you go
Up to the cabin

47
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:22,014
In portland
For a couple of weeks?

48
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,479
And i'll see if i can
Get the reveal moved out
There.

49
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,908
You wrote first star of
Evening
There in less than a month.

50
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:28,254
I wrote it as a joke.

51
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:30,179
You wrote it because
Katherine broke your heart.

52
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:32,154
Portland has always been
A great place

53
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,693
For you to get
Your center again.

54
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:34,987
Just like it was
For your parents.

55
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:36,289
I remember when
Your mom told me

56
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,320
They were buying
A place up there.

57
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:39,485
I thought they were crazy.

58
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,163
So far from everything.

59
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:43,603
But it became
Their little hideaway.

60
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,427
Get out of town for a while.

61
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,132
Clear your head.

62
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:51,444
And get ready for
The best chapter of your
Life.

63
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:55,838
The next one
Is gonna be a great one.

64
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,413
[announcement]: this will
Serve
As the final boarding call

65
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:59,081
For flight 782 to denver,

66
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,549
And continuing on
To portland.

67
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:05,854
[breathless woman]:
I'm here!

68
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,123
-welcome aboard.
-sorry.

69
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,151
[attendant]: here,
I'll take your bag.

70
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:10,316
[woman]: that cab driver
Dropped
Me off at the wrong
Terminal.

71
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,664
I can barely walk in heels,
Much less run.

72
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,690
[attendant]: 1-c,
Right up here in first
Class.

73
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,355
[woman]: are you sure?

74
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,663
[attendant]:
Your upgrade went through.

75
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:21,196
[woman]: you're kidding.
That never happens.

76
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:22,472
[attendant]:
Must be your lucky day.

77
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,099
[woman]: thank you.

78
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,036
-hi.
-hello.

79
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,912
[relieved sigh]

80
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,780
First class.

81
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,179
I feel so special.

82
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,380
They'll even bring you
A glass of champagne,

83
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,822
If you want.

84
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:40,287
No. No.
I... I shouldn't.

85
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:41,747
Well, maybe just one.

86
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,655
But i have
Lots of work to do,

87
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:44,987
So i won't--
Don't worry,

88
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,992
I won't be talking your
Ear off the whole time.

89
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,155
Do you live
In new york?

90
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:52,233
No, i'm heading home.
Portland.

91
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:55,133
I was just in the city
For a couple of job
Interviews.

92
00:03:55,135 --> 00:03:56,635
Ah. I hope they went well.

93
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:57,837
We'll see.

94
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,198
Everybody was really nice.

95
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:01,406
Maybe too nice.

96
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:05,678
I... It's just so hard to
Know
What people are really
Thinking.

97
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,849
I wish they would just
Say what they mean.

98
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,278
Things would be
So much easier that way.

99
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,354
Not always.
Sometimes the truth hurts.

100
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,723
Hurts a lot less than lies.

101
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:16,722
Sounds like the voice
Of experience talking.

102
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,264
That obvious?

103
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,290
[chuckles]

104
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:21,334
Champagne?

105
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,798
Two.

106
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,827
Definitely.

107
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:28,596
To a great flight.

108
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,642
With lots of
Fabulous legroom.

109
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,565
[clink]

110
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,943
[♪♪]

111
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,499
You seem very focused.

112
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:59,058
Is it good?

113
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,696
It wants to be.

114
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,402
If that makes any sense.

115
00:05:03,404 --> 00:05:04,844
The new
Gabriel august?

116
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:06,508
Thought that book
Wasn't out.

117
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:08,337
Mm. I got
An advance copy.

118
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,512
You read
Gabriel august?

119
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,111
[laughs]

120
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:14,282
No, but
I've heard of him.

121
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:16,521
Yeah, you don't...
You don't really seem

122
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,317
Like his typical
Demographic.

123
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,189
So you don't like this one?

124
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:22,087
No. I... I do.

125
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,819
It's just his first book,

126
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,285
First star of evening,

127
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:27,933
Was so good.

128
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,328
Really?

129
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,630
I-- i think the first novel
Was such a success

130
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:35,673
Because it was just so
Honest.

131
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,439
You really felt like
You knew those characters.

132
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,339
Sounds like
I should give it a read.

133
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,641
Absolutely.

134
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:44,712
Just... Maybe skip this one.

135
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,182
It's a little
Disappointing.

136
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,380
It doesn't feel real.

137
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,711
It's like...

138
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:51,346
He took the first book
And stuck it in a blender

139
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:53,392
And mixed it up and
Put a new title on it.

140
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,287
Oh! That's harsh.

141
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,889
I guess.

142
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:01,361
I hate to see such potential
Go to waste.

143
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,232
Have you heard about this?

144
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,660
He has this whole
Marketing gimmick.

145
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,465
He's very mysterious.

146
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:08,027
It's a little ridiculous.

147
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,065
You think it's a gimmick?

148
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,339
What else could it be?

149
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,597
I'm sure he has his reasons.

150
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:14,165
Whatever it is,
I guess it's working,

151
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:17,084
Because along with
Every other woman in
America,

152
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:21,507
I am actually curious
To find out who he really
Is.

153
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,445
[announcement]:
Ladies and gentlemen,

154
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,750
The captain has begun
Our descent into portland,

155
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,323
And we'll be landing
Shortly.

156
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,391
[sighs]

157
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:30,219
Well...

158
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,494
This has ruined me.

159
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:35,264
I don't think
I can go back to coach.

160
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,338
I'm going to finish.

161
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,780
[airport bustling]

162
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:54,711
Hey!

163
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,075
Hey there.

164
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,583
You look like
You're in a hurry.

165
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,256
Staff meeting at work.
I'm barely gonna make it.

166
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,487
Do you want me
To help you with your bag?

167
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,462
Looks like you're the one
That could use the help.

168
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,761
Oh...

169
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,132
Sorry. I gotta run.

170
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,961
It was really nice
Meeting you.

171
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,026
Yeah. You too.

172
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,944
[♪♪]

173
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,233
[♪♪]

174
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,487
It's not usually
So jammed up

175
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,055
At the taxi line.

176
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,133
Just my luck.

177
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,961
My boss'll kill me
If i'm late again.

178
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,826
I'm happy
To give you a lift.

179
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,536
My mom always told me

180
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,097
Never to accept
Rides in limos

181
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,035
From strangers
I met on airplanes.

182
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,711
Your mom gave you
Very specific advice.

183
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:02,778
Come on. It's got just
As much legroom as first
Class.

184
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:04,353
We can even
Split the tip,

185
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,481
If that makes you feel
Better.

00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:07,386

Know your name.

You live in new york?

Mostly.

I like spending time
In portland, though.

Any plans for tonight?

My two best friends have
Their engagement party.

Well, they were
Just friends for years.

This whole falling-in-love
Thing
Has kind of came out of
Nowhere.

It's taken
A little getting used to.

But it's a good thing?

207

Hoof it from here.

Gonna split the tip.

Actually, pretty good.

The job interviews
Went well?

240
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:16,043
A couple of the magazines
Were interested.

241
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,343
I'm just not sure
I want to move to new york.

Four more staffers

He's cute!

Not as cute as you,
Of course,

But he's definitely hot.
Who is he?

255
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,734
We sat next to each other
On the plane,

256
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,972
And then he ended up
Giving me a ride.

257
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:49,268
In a limo.

258
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,399

You rode in a car

With a guy
You just met.

260
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,811
He was in first class.
How dangerous could he be?

261
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:56,067
So when are you
Gonna see him again?

262
00:12:56,076 --> 00:12:57,076
It wasn't like that.

Have his number.

Okay.

00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,447
It's nice if a guy
Isn't too hard on the eyes,

268
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,523
But that kind of thing
Being really important?

269
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:09,752
Never again.

270
00:13:09,756 --> 00:13:11,286
I wonder why
Was he in a limo.

271
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,761
You think he's famous,
Or just rich?

272
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,030
Neither.

273
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,459
He was some kind
Of consultant.

00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,134
He's...he's just
A regular guy.

Having the whole world know
That he cheated on me.

That's so annoying

How could i have had no
Clue?

That's why.

So what am i supposed to do?

298
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,750
Just assume that every guy
I meet is lying to me?

299
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:10,879
Not every guy,

300
00:14:10,884 --> 00:14:12,524
Just most of them.

301
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,519
You just gotta wait till
The right one comes along.

Someone much better.

She already has.

On practically every
Gossip website, but...

When you date a famous
Person.

00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,217
I promise you, though,

320
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,225
I'm totally fine.

00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,637
Absolutely. Portland
Was a great idea.

00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:13,746
Good.

331
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:16,707
I was starting
To worry about you.

332
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,576
You haven't written a thing,
Have you?

333
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,516
Why do you think that?

334
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,861
Because you sound
Way too relaxed.

335
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:25,617
Maybe you should
Shake things up a little,

336
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,585
Go out with friends,

337
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,063
Or on a date or something.

338
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,332
Well, i did meet a nice
Woman
On the plane.

And i have no idea
Where to find her.

The easy way, can you?

00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,839
Oh!

00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,470

Back to new york for it.

It'll be liam and jackie,
Just like always.

But i'll be the one up there
In front of all those
People.

It's gonna be hard

351
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:58,163
For you to let go of

Mystique,

353
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,656
But you can't keep
Leading two lives like this.

354
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:05,301
This is a good thing.

355
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,228
Have i ever steered
You wrong before?

356
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,033
Is that a trick question?

357
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:11,095
I'll call you
When i get out there,

358
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,814
And you can show me
Your town, mr. Portland.

359
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,007
Is it a date?

360
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,338
Yeah. It's a date.

361
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:18,213
-bye.
-bye.

362
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,680
Well,
As you've probably guessed,

363
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,386
We got our new numbers back,
And they're not pretty.

364
00:16:29,389 --> 00:16:33,219
Circulation is down 23%
From the same time last
Year.

365
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,986
So, going forward,
I have it from on high

366
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,896
That we need to spice things
Up.

367
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:39,927
I need your pieces
To jump off the page.

368
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,203
Get noticed.

369
00:16:41,201 --> 00:16:43,431
If you want to do
A feel-good fluff piece

370
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,596
On a pee-wee baseball team,

371
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,504
Scrap it and find out

372
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,766
When the trail blazers
Are firing their coach.

373
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:50,944
They want us to make noise,

374
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:53,184
Get retweeted or facebooked,

375
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,509
Or whatever
The kids are doing these
Days.

376
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,075
Books, movies,
Restaurant reviews--

377
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,654
Nothing's just "okay"
Anymore.

378
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:02,092
They're either fantastic

379
00:17:02,088 --> 00:17:03,248
Or the worst thing
You've ever seen.

380
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:04,386
I'm talking extreme
Opinions.

381
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,761
But you don't want us

382
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,829
To write reviews
We don't believe in, do you?

383
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,527
Well, if that's what it
Takes,
Then yeah.

384
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,459
It's how we generate
Web hits and subscriptions.

385
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,934
Look, i don't love it,
But it's the hand we're
Dealt.

386
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,334
All right, i'll have
New assignments

387
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,966
For all of you in a few.

388
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:19,301
Make me proud.

389
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,112
Sophie.

390
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,051
Got something for you
That might be interesting.

391
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:30,247
After your little speech,
I'm almost afraid to ask.

392
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,620
That review you're doing

393
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,248
On gabriel august's
New book?

394
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,193
I'm not gonna turn it
Into a hatchet piece

395
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,688
Just to get more tweets.

396
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:37,989
I've got something
Even better.

397
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:40,431
I just found out that
Jasper's is hosting

398
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,127
Gabriel august's
Little coming-out party

399
00:17:42,128 --> 00:17:43,158
Tomorrow night,

400
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:44,233
Right here in portland.

401
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,230
I want you to cover it.

402
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,461
We'll run it with the
Review.

403
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:49,626
Wait. He's revealing
His true identity here?

404
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,266
Why portland?

405
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:53,701
It's your job to find out.

406
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:59,642
[♪♪]

407
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,261
[hushed conversation]

408
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,628
Deep breaths.
This is a good thing.

409
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:15,657
Once this is over,

410
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,302
You can stop
Leading two lives.

411
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:18,527
I'll never just
Be liam bradley.

412
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:19,861
All everyone
Will care about

413
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:21,026
Is gabriel august.

414
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,434
That's who i'll be from now
On.

415
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,335
It's going to be okay.
I promise.

416
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:25,937
And it's gonna feel so good

417
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,739
To finally get this
Off your chest.

418
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,010
Okay, i think it's time.

419
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,078
We don't want to
Keep them waiting.

420
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:32,837
I'm gonna go
And make the introduction.

421
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:35,076
You wait here,
I point to you,

422
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,611
And that's it...

423
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,016
And the world
Meets gabriel august

424
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,147
For the first time.

425
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:41,592
Okay. I'm as ready as i can
Be.

426
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,518
You're gonna be great.
They're gonna love you.

427
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,917
You should take
That seat in the front.

428
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,756
Got it.

429
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:56,874
[jackie]:
If i can have your
Attention?

430
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,170
I think you're all
About as excited

431
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,601
To be here tonight
As i am.

432
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,466
With millions of books

433
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,574
Sold worldwide
Over the last three years,

434
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:06,236
Gabriel august has touched
All our hearts.

435
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:09,106
He has made us fall in love,
And he has made us cry.

436
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,575
It's my pleasure
To introduce to you

437
00:19:11,584 --> 00:19:13,994
The man behind
These incredible stories.

438
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,087
Ladies and gentlemen...

439
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:17,959
Please allow me to introduce
You all

440
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,957
To the writer
You've come to know

441
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:22,729
As gabriel august.

442
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:25,159
[applause]

443
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,769
[applause tapers off]

444
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:46,151
I had a feeling
I might find you here.

445
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,752
This was always
Your favorite spot to write.

446
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,785
I can't fool you, can i?

447
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,720
No.

448
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,425
And you'd best remember
That.

449
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:56,657
Liam, what
Were you thinking?

450
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,733
I was standing there
Like an idiot,

451
00:19:58,731 --> 00:20:00,061
Pointing at no one.

452
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,126
I'm really sorry.

453
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:02,704
I just... I panicked.

454
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,402
Your publisher
Is furious.

455
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,774
They're threatening

456
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,242
To release your name and
Information themselves.

457
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
Well, they can't
Do that!

458
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,441
Well, they won't, not yet.

459
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:12,813
I told them if they did,
We'd sue them,

460
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:15,052
And we'd make
A big, ugly public
Spectacle.

461
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,778
You must not be
Very popular over there.

462
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:18,924
It's not my job
To be popular.

463
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,748
It's my job to look
After my clients,

464
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:22,553
Even the ones
That make me crazy.

465
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,985
More bad news.

466
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,160
Mm.

467
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,928
One of the first reviews
For by the lighthouse.

468
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:29,827
It's pretty
Disappointing.

469
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:33,629
"tepid attempts
At conveying human
Emotion..."

470
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,368
-it's her!
-who?

471
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,711
Sophie. The girl from
The plane and limo ride.

472
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:42,237
That's why she was
At the bookstore!

473
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,672
To write about
Gabriel august.

474
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:44,776
-this is incredible.

475
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:45,777
Incredible?
I'd hate to hear

476
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,078
What you think a bad
Review looks like.

477
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,110
I gotta go!
We'll talk soon.

478
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,414
Liam!

479
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,575
I gotta find her.

480
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:55,919
Liam!

481
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,592
We still have to talk about
Rescheduling your reveal!

482
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,291
I'll call you later!

483
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:02,933
Li-- [frustrated sigh]

484
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,697
[♪♪]

485
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,001
Sorry.

486
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,274
Liam?

487
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,212
Sophie!

488
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:17,307
Sorry. That--
That was totally my fault.

489
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,640
No, no. It was all me.

490
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,535
They need to pass a "no
Texting
While walking" bill,

491
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:21,546
Like new york.

492
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,177
They have those there?

493
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,079
Right.

494
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,845
So where're you heading
In such a rush?

495
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:30,494
Home.
I just got off work.

496
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,720
I write book reviews
For the portland record.

497
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,225
Really?

498
00:21:34,227 --> 00:21:35,427
That sounds interesting.

499
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,726
Look, i realize we just met,
You know, again,

500
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,103
But maybe you'd like
To grab a bite to eat
Sometime?

501
00:21:43,102 --> 00:21:45,072
I--

502
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,901
That's really nice,

503
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,536
But i have a lot
Of work to do.

504
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,911
Aw, come on!
You eat, i eat.

505
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:52,039
Let's eat
At the same table.

506
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:53,705
Persistent,
Aren't you?

507
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:54,913
Well, i'm usually not,

508
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:57,754
But it seems like
This might be worth it.

509
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,780
One meal couldn't
Hurt, right?

510
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:01,816
I suppose not.

511
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:05,021
I think
I'll take that as a yes.

512
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,394
[♪♪]

513
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,438
[♪♪]

514
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,978
[quiet shock]: no way....

515
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:41,464
So you just ran into
Him on the street?

516
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,131
That's, like, fate.

517
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:45,629
Okay, don't
Get carried away.

518
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,232
But here's
The interesting part.

519
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,995
His parents

520
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,373
Are devon hillman
And helen bradley.

521
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,312
The movie stars?
You're kidding!

522
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:55,607
-no.
-are you sure?

523
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:58,178
I saw a picture
Of him with them.

524
00:22:58,177 --> 00:23:01,077
Well, that's why he rides
In limos and flies first
Class.

525
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,910
His parents were
Celebrities.

526
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:05,715
He was just 19 when
They died in that plane
Crash.

527
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:06,718
That was so sad.

528
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,919
It was awful.

529
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:13,562
Do you think it's weird
That he didn't mention it?

530
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,789
To hide something
So important?

531
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:17,225
You hardly know him.

532
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,360
Why would he tell you

533
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:19,734
The most traumatic
Story of his life

534
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,032
When you guys haven't even
Been on a date yet?

535
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:22,533
[groans] i know.

536
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:23,595
You're right.

537
00:23:23,603 --> 00:23:25,243
I mean, i'm just...

538
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,268
You're being paranoid,
That's what.

539
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:30,473
Not all guys are hiding
Things like james.

540
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:31,876
You need to
Give liam a chance.

541
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,038
Oh!

542
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:38,577
Who's this liam?

543
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,954
The guy that sophie's
Going on a date with.

544
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:43,823
It-- it's not a date,
It's just dinner.

545
00:23:43,823 --> 00:23:45,023
Why are you holding back?

546
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:47,224
You either like him,
Or you don't.

547
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:50,326
I-i do like him.
I just...

548
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:52,129
I wish i knew him better.

549
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,031
Hello!
That's what a date's for.

550
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:55,503
To get to know somebody.

551
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,571
I thought i knew james.

552
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,670
I never liked that one.

553
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,471
That's right.

554
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:02,143
You didn't.

555
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,611
You guys knew
There was something wrong

556
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,879
Before i did.

557
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,777
That's how i'll know--
I'll introduce him to you,

558
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,809
And you can tell me
What you think.

559
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:10,775
You want us
To crash your date?

560
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,183
Brilliant, right?

561
00:24:12,185 --> 00:24:14,645
Yeah. Let me
Check him out first.

562
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,050
Thank you.

563
00:24:17,056 --> 00:24:19,156
[doorbell chimes]

564
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,833
Just because you don't
Answer the phone

565
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:28,503
Doesn't mean
I'm gonna go away.

566
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:31,401
I honestly was not
Trying to avoid you.

567
00:24:31,404 --> 00:24:33,404
Okay, maybe i was, but not
For the reason you think.

568
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:35,566
I was actually writing
Today.

569
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:36,905
That's great.

570
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,439
Well,
It wasn't great,

571
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:42,205
But it was
Something, anyway.

572
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:46,145
The words,
They are coming.

573
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,522
I don't like them
Once they're on the page.

574
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:49,791
So kind of less of
A writer's block issue,

575
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:52,119
And more of
A heart-not-being-in-it
Issue?

576
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:54,334
And don't you look dapper?

577
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,557
Yeah.

578
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,701
I found her. Sophie.

579
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:59,797
We're going to dinner.

580
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,769
You really like this girl,
Don't you?

581
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,727
I haven't seen you
Like this in ages.

582
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,096
Oh...

583
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:07,004
You know, i felt something
When i met her.

584
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,506
Something strange.

585
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:09,868
She's not like other women.

586
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:12,576
She's interesting
And...

587
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:13,938
And unique.

588
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:15,406
And she tells it
Like it is, right?

589
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:16,914
How did you know that?

590
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:19,176
I know you pretty well
After all these years,
Honey.

591
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:22,615
I feel nervous around her,
But it's a good nervous.

592
00:25:22,622 --> 00:25:24,362
Yeah, i'd be
A bit nervous, too,

593
00:25:24,357 --> 00:25:26,687
If i was going out with
Somebody
Who hated my book so much.

594
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,733
Ah. It really
Hasn't come up yet.

595
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,774
I'm going to let you get
Ready for your date, liam,

596
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:39,269
But please be careful.

597
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:41,342
I worry enough
About your ability

598
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,040
To lead
One double life.

599
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:45,482
I don't think you have
The heart for a second.

600
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,747
[♪♪]

601
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,859
[doorbell chimes]

602
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,030
Hi.

603
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:08,232
Hi. These are for you.

604
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:11,574
Thank you.
They're beautiful.

605
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:13,641
Come on in.

606
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,237
Hi!

607
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,446
Um, hello.

608
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,377
Uh, it was
The strangest thing.

609
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:25,422
I was getting ready, and--

610
00:26:25,418 --> 00:26:27,688
Drew and i
Were in the neighborhood

611
00:26:27,687 --> 00:26:30,287
And wanted to return a book
To sophie.

612
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,459
This one.

613
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:33,188
[chuckles]

614
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,932
Where are my manners?

615
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,427
Um, drew and nina,
This is liam.

616
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,260
No limo tonight?

617
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:40,895
Uh, i have a car here
In town.

618
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,070
So you have a place here
And a place in new york?

619
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,170
You don't really
See that very often.

620
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:48,972
Exactly what kind of
Consulting do you do?

621
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:49,935
Drew, you don't need

622
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:50,982
To interrogate
Poor liam here.

623
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:51,907
(sotto)
I thought that's what

624
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:53,111
I was supposed to do?

625
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,482
How about
A glass of wine?

626
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,551
Wine sounds wonderful!

627
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:58,880
And it gives us
The opportunity

628
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:00,154
To get to know
A little bit more

629
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:01,422
About liam here.

630
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,890
Great!

631
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,720
So how long were
You in guayana?

632
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:08,786
I did the full
Two-year volunteer rotation.

633
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,764
It's really
An amazing country.

634
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:12,403
That must've been
Tough, though.

635
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:14,058
Volunteering was
The hardest thing i ever
Did,

636
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,596
But i wouldn't trade it
For anything.

637
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:16,671
Wow.

638
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:19,799
You're full of surprises.

639
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:23,837
Well, this has
Been fun.

640
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:26,583
We should all go out
When we have more time.

641
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:28,209
Absolutely. And drew,
I'm going to hold you

642
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:29,384
To your offer
To play hoops.

643
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:31,252
I'm no lebron james,
But maybe a dwayne wade.

644
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,420
All right,
But i will warn you--

645
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:34,748
Once i lace up,

646
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:36,024
I'm more like 6'6" with
A 40-inch vertical, so.

647
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,092
[laughs]

648
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,659
Have fun
Tonight, kids.

649
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:39,918
Bye!

650
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:42,885
And thanks for, um,
Bringing the book back.

651
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,625
I think they liked you.

652
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:49,934
Well, that's great,

653
00:27:49,935 --> 00:27:51,895
But they're not the ones
I'm trying to impress.

654
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,706
I like you too.

655
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,678
Now, that's what
I like to hear.

656
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:58,637
[laughs]

657
00:27:58,644 --> 00:27:59,814
You ready for dinner?

658
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,712
I have the perfect place.

659
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:03,914
I was surprised.

660
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:06,116
Nina and drew and i
Have been friends forever.

661
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,718
So what made them
Start to date?

662
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:10,121
Actually, i think

663
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:11,392
They'd been in love
For years,

664
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,120
But they were both
Just so afraid

665
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,355
Of ruining
The friendship

666
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,060
That they never
Gave it a chance.

667
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:17,962
How's the cobbler?

668
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:19,363
Mm! Wonderful, harris.

669
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:20,655
As always.

670
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,996
Everything is delicious.

671
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:24,542
You mean that,

672
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:27,037
Or are you just saying
What you think i want to
Hear?

673
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,339
No, it was really good.

674
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:30,811
[phone rings]

675
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:32,680
Oh. Sorry.

676
00:28:32,678 --> 00:28:36,148
I've got to
Take this. Work.

677
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,318
[♪♪]

678
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,789
So, liam...

679
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,063
You ever been married?

680
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,491
Um, no.

681
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:52,856
Why not?
Something wrong with you?

682
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:55,265
[chuckles, then stops]

683
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,601
So no alarm bells
Went off for either of you?

684
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:01,966
We loved him.

685
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,574
Even drew,

686
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,776
Who was prepared to duke it
Out
With him beforehand.

687
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,078
How's dinner going?

688
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,949
We're having a nice time.

689
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:11,418
But he still hasn't
Mentioned his parents,

690
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:12,817
And he keeps
Changing the subject

691
00:29:12,818 --> 00:29:14,688
Every time
I bring up his work.

692
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,047
Give him time.

693
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:18,315
How's it going with harris?

694
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,793
It doesn't look good.

695
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:25,526
Maybe i shouldn't
Have left him alone.

696
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:29,201
Well, let me know how it
Goes,
'Cause he seems really
Great.

697
00:29:29,201 --> 00:29:31,101
Bye.

698
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:36,172
That's her recipe
For peach cobbler

699
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:38,275
You're eating.

700
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:38,907
It's the best
I've ever tasted.

701
00:29:38,911 --> 00:29:39,841
Honestly.

702
00:29:39,845 --> 00:29:41,575
Am i interrupting?

703
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,850
Not at all!

704
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:45,248
Come. Sit.

705
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:47,621
I was just
Telling liam here

706
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,120
The story of lola

707
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,051
And why i named the
Restaurant
After her.

708
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,486
I thought you didn't like
To talk about that.

709
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,892
Well, the story's
Not for everyone,

710
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:57,425
But liam here

711
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:58,829
Seemed to understand.

712
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:01,271
I'm sorry
You lost her so soon.

713
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:03,827
Well, it's better
To have loved and lost

714
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:05,266
And all that, right?

715
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:08,871
I like to think
She's here with me every
Day.

716
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:12,742
Nice to meet you, liam.

717
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:13,905
You too.

718
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,380
The next time,

719
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:19,553
You've got to try
The chocolate mousse.

720
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:20,952
It's not to be missed.

721
00:30:20,953 --> 00:30:23,253
Can't wait.

722
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:28,391
What?

723
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:29,994
Wow.

724
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:33,125
He must really like you
To open up about lola.

725
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,362
Is that a good thing?

726
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:36,326
Yes.

727
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:41,665
It's...a great thing.

728
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:43,844
[creek trickling]

729
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,949
Harris actually
Liked him?

730
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,320
Loved him.

731
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:54,688
Sounds like he passed
Your little test, right?

732
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:55,687
With flying colors.

733
00:30:55,688 --> 00:30:57,788
But he still won't
Talk about his work.

734
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,390
Or his family.

735
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,291
It's like
He's an open book

736
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:02,733
About some things,

737
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:05,328
And then completely
Mysterious about others.

738
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:07,401
It sounds like
Problem isn't him,

739
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,929
It's you.

740
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:11,644
What are you
Talking about?

741
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:13,767
I get that you have
Trust issues.

742
00:31:13,772 --> 00:31:14,942
Who wouldn't
In your position?

743
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,270
But you need
To be careful

744
00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:16,965
Not to project
Your stuff onto liam.

745
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:18,176
It's not fair.

746
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:21,547
Okay, well, what about
Just-- just one more test?

747
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:22,647
I felt so much better

748
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:24,548
After he met
You guys last night

749
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,120
And you liked him.

750
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:27,148
Sophie.

751
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:29,392
Okay, just hear me out.

752
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,748
I want to see him at work,

753
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:33,156
Just find out what
This whole consulting thing

754
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:34,358
Is all about.

755
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,190
I mean,
What could it hurt?

756
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,325
Come on!

757
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,031

758
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,865
[phone rings]

759
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,939
Can't talk now.
Finally in the zone.

760
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:54,645
Thrilled to hear it,
But we still need to meet

761
00:31:54,647 --> 00:31:56,807
To go over the details
Of the rescheduled reveal.

762
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:58,175
Today's not good.

763
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,353
So, today at 1:00,

764
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:00,451
At the river village
Restaurant,

765
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:01,792
I've booked
A lovely outdoor table.

766
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:03,287
You can walk over
From the marina.

767
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,219
Can't we do this
Later this week?

768
00:32:04,223 --> 00:32:05,623
See you at one.

769
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:06,864

770
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:08,929

[phone ringing]

772
00:32:22,675 --> 00:32:24,775
Hey!
I was going to call you,

773
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:26,707
But didn't want to
Bother you at work.

774
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:28,382
I was worried about
The same thing.

775
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,050
I'm not interrupting,
Am i?

776
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:32,479
Not at all.
Really enjoyed last night.

777
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,454
Me too. I--

778
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:34,422
[ship's bell clangs]

779
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,520
What was that?

780
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:36,891
Are you--
Are you at the marina?

781
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:38,589
Uh, yeah.

782
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,260
I'm, uh, meeting a client at
River village restaurant at
One,

783
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,260
A business meeting.

784
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:43,461
A client?

785
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:44,962
Um, that's good.

786
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,434
Maybe we can figure out

787
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:47,862
A time to see
Each other again.

788
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:49,726
Yeah. I'd like that.

789
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:53,135
Um, i've got to go.

790
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,172
Bye.

791
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:57,214
Bye.

792
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,939
[♪♪]

793
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,079
So i've rescheduled
The reveal

794
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,452
For friday at six,

795
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,920
And i will handcuff you
To me if i have to.

796
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:08,019
It's such
Terrible timing.

797
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,390
Sophie and i
Are just starting

798
00:33:09,388 --> 00:33:10,518
To get to know
Each other.

799
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:11,792
You haven't told her,
Have you?

800
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,890
Once she finds out

801
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,361
I'm gabriel august,
That's all i'll be to her.

802
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,090
That's all i'll be
To everybody.

803
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:17,325
[jackie]:
How can you know that,

804
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,629
If you don't trust her
Enough
To tell her the truth?

805
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,600
Well, you know how
It was with my parents.

806
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:23,529
People treated them
Differently
Because they were stars.

807
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,335
Hi.

808
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,567
Oh, no.
This is not happening.

809
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:28,643
It's her.

810
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,710
She's pretty!

811
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,268
Hey.

812
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:33,476
Sophie.
This is a surprise.

813
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:35,309
I-i was, um...

814
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:37,584
Covering a story
Just around the corner,

815
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,723
And remembered you saying
You were having lunch here,
So--

816
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,349
So you just stopped by?

817
00:33:43,287 --> 00:33:45,257
That's weird, isn't it?

818
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:46,987
It was all very spontaneous.

819
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:48,462
Um...

820
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,090
I'll leave you to your
Lunch.

821
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:52,899
-you're jackie billicks.
-yes.

822
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:54,258
The literary agent.

823
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:56,066
Oh, um, i have to say,

824
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,698
I'm not used to being
Recognized
Outside of new york.

825
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:01,474
I saw you speak in 2011

826
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,543
At the brooklyn
Publishing symposium.

827
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,442
You were so inspiring.

828
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:06,444
Jackie,

829
00:34:06,445 --> 00:34:08,345
This is
Sophie atkinson.

830
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:10,147
It's wonderful
To meet you, sophie.

831
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:13,119
I actually write book
Reviews
For the portland record,

832
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:17,818
And i probably owe you
And gabriel august

833
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:18,763
My review
Wasn't very favorable.

834
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,057
No apology needed.

835
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,789
You were
Just doing your job.

836
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:24,634
I can't believe
You didn't tell me

837
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,060
You knew gabriel
August's agent.

838
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:28,025
Well, it's great to meet
You.

839
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:29,333
I'll let you two talk.

840
00:34:29,334 --> 00:34:31,104
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

841
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:33,603
This is just
A social call anyway.

842
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,705
Please join us. Please.

843
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,407
Oh...

844
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,579
Thank you.

845
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,976
I keep telling gabriel
That he'll feel better

846
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:50,616
If he tells the world
Who he is,

847
00:34:50,622 --> 00:34:52,162
But men, you know?

848
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:53,787
So stubborn.

849
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,762
But-- but it is
Really happening?

850
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,891
Oh, yeah. Next friday.

851
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:59,896
If i have to drag him
Kicking and screaming.

852
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,768
[sophie laughs]

853
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,327
Okay.

854
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:05,335
At the risk of
Sounding like a teenager,

855
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:06,837
What is he like?

856
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,439
[laughs]

857
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,970
Well, he's, uh, smart.

858
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,406
Quite smart,
When he wants to be.

859
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,911
He is genuinely talented,

860
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:17,513
He's very handsome.

861
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:21,046
He's also obstinate,
He's private to a fault,

862
00:35:21,053 --> 00:35:22,323
And sometimes he exhibits

863
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,121
The same amount of
Judgment as my beagle.

864
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:25,663
[both laughing]

865
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,527
I felt bad,

866
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:29,887
Writing
The review i did,

867
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:32,795
But the truth is,

868
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:36,698
I really want his next book
To be great, like the first
One,

869
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:38,802
And maybe not having secrets
Will help.

870
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:41,344
Maybe his next book
Will be his masterpiece.

871
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,740
I hope so, sophie.

872
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:46,381
Well, i've got a deadline
That needs some love.

873
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:48,908
Jackie, i'm so glad
We got the chance to talk.

874
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:49,984
Same here!

875
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:51,312
And next time
You're in new york,

876
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,476
Give me a jingle,
We'll have lunch.

877
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,224
I would love that.

878
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:55,989
I will see you later?

879
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:57,648
I can't wait.
I'll call you.

880
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,986
Napkin...

881
00:35:58,991 --> 00:35:59,991
[chuckling]

882
00:35:59,992 --> 00:36:02,132
Wow...

883
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:03,857
Thanks for that, jackie.

884
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:05,832
You need to tell her,

885
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,161
Before this--

886
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,826
Whatever
This is between you two--

887
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:10,865
Goes any further.

888
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:12,469
Well, it's easier said
Than done.

889
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:14,441
I never said
It was gonna be easy.

890
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,913
It's so beautiful
Down here.

891
00:36:21,914 --> 00:36:23,484
I never think
To do this.

892
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:25,482
I come here every sunset.

893
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:26,954
Helps clear my head.

894
00:36:26,952 --> 00:36:28,992
It's one of my favorite
Things
About the city.

895
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,717
Why portland?

896
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,622
I have a feeling

00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:17,917
It sounds wonderful.

1076
00:44:17,922 --> 00:44:19,462
Everybody needs
Some place to escape to.

1077
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:21,057
Exactly.

1078
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:23,329
That's what it's like
For me out here.

1079
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,728
Dinner awaits.

1080
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:29,070
It's beautiful!

1081
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,727
I didn't realize
You were such a romantic.

1082
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:33,996
Ah, i didn't either.

1083
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:37,937
This is delicious.

1084
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:40,182
Mm. I can't cook
To save my life,

1085
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:42,378
But i am fantastic
At ordering well.

1086
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:46,975
Uh, look, there's
Something important

1087
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:48,115
I need to tell you,

1088
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:50,849
But i'm not really
Sure how to say it.

1089
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,885
More couscous?

1090
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:54,421
I'm fine.

1091
00:44:54,426 --> 00:44:56,056
Right.
Uh, all right, uh...

1092
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:57,661
The thing is,

1093
00:44:57,662 --> 00:44:58,962
When we first met,

1094
00:44:58,963 --> 00:45:00,763
I didn't think things
Would progress so far.

1095
00:45:00,765 --> 00:45:02,025
Liam, wait.

1096
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,233
Before
You say anything,

1097
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:06,144
I... I have to
Tell you something.

1098
00:45:06,137 --> 00:45:07,437
I...

1099
00:45:07,439 --> 00:45:10,009
Haven't been totally
Honest with you.

1100
00:45:10,008 --> 00:45:10,968
You haven't?

1101
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:12,775
Remember how i told you

1102
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,777
I recently went
Through a bad break-up?

1103
00:45:14,779 --> 00:45:16,249
You're getting back
Together with him.

1104
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:17,147
What?

1105
00:45:17,148 --> 00:45:18,178
No!

1106
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:19,353
Absolutely not.

1107
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:22,850
Never. I just...

1108
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:24,824
The whole thing
Actually hit me

1109
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:28,123
A lot harder
Than i admitted.

1110
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:30,186
He was a professional
Athlete,

1111
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:32,695
And the break-up
Was very public,

1112
00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:34,627
And...

1113
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:37,702
Pretty humiliating,
Honestly.

1114
00:45:37,702 --> 00:45:39,472
My terrible love life
Went viral.

1115
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:41,141
That must've been awful.

1116
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,109
Yeah.

1117
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:43,137
A word of advice--

1118
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:44,471
Never date
A famous person.

1119
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:47,806
I won't make
That mistake again.

1120
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:53,016
The worst part,
Though, was that...

1121
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:57,017
This man that
I thought i loved

1122
00:45:57,021 --> 00:46:00,021
Ended up being someone
Completely different

1123
00:46:00,024 --> 00:46:02,194
Than i thought he was.

1124
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:05,833
I guess i just lost
My ability to trust men.

1125
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:09,800
And so when i met you,

1126
00:46:09,801 --> 00:46:11,401
I was like,

1127
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:14,572
"wow, too good
To be true."

1128
00:46:14,572 --> 00:46:16,642
And so i've kind of been
Giving you little tests

1129
00:46:16,641 --> 00:46:18,111
Just to prove

1130
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:21,079
That you aren't...
Too good to be true.

1131
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:22,209
Tests?

1132
00:46:22,213 --> 00:46:23,383
Yeah.

1133
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:25,311
This is embarrassing.

1134
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:28,786
I... My friends
Interrogating you.

1135
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,517
Me dropping by
During your lunch

1136
00:46:30,522 --> 00:46:31,722
With your client.

1137
00:46:31,723 --> 00:46:33,293
I kind of arranged
Those things

1138
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,491
Just to help myself
Make sure

1139
00:46:35,493 --> 00:46:38,393
That this was real.

1140
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:40,296
Oh! And the girl
You met

1141
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:42,228
In front of
My office, tabitha,

1142
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:43,603
We actually
Work together,

1143
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:47,571
And i overheard her
Asking you out.

1144
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:50,072
You're the only woman
I wanted to go out with.

1145
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:51,444
I know that now.

1146
00:46:51,442 --> 00:46:53,242
And i should've

1147
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:55,114
Trusted it
From the beginning.

1148
00:46:55,113 --> 00:46:56,553
I'm so sorry, liam.

1149
00:46:56,548 --> 00:46:58,008
I don't know
What else to say.

1150
00:46:58,016 --> 00:47:00,046
So that's it?

1151
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:01,881
That's what you haven't
Been honest about?

1152
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:03,086
You hate me,
Don't you?

1153
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:05,187
Sophie,
I don't hate you.

1154
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:07,060
I'm falling in love
With you.

1155
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:21,468
Okay.

1156
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:23,612
That went better
Than i thought it would.

1157
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:35,415
[♪♪]

1158
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:40,020
I feel so much better
Having that out in the open.

1159
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:45,804
I've been so nervous all
Night.

1160
00:47:45,797 --> 00:47:47,627
There was something
You wanted to say to me.

1161
00:47:47,632 --> 00:47:49,472
What? Oh. Oh, nothing.

1162
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:50,567
Are you sure?

1163
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:51,798
I'm so sorry.

1164
00:47:51,803 --> 00:47:53,473
I feel like i kind of
Hijacked your moment.

1165
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:55,241
Ah, it's not important.

1166
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,940
More wine?

1167
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,578
Please.

1168
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:04,482
I can't wait to see
What's for dessert.

1169
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:13,515
What was i
Supposed to do?

1170
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:15,464
You were supposed to
Tell her the truth.

1171
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,630
Well, this athlete
She was engaged to

1172
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:17,658
Broke her heart,

1173
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:19,032
And half the country
Was talking about it.

1174
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,130
She swore she'd never
Date a famous person again.

1175
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:22,772
What do you think

1176
00:48:22,767 --> 00:48:24,067
She's gonna do when
She finds out who i really
Am?

1177
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,298
I can't just dump
All this on her.

1178
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:26,603
You've run out of time.

1179
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:28,044
The reveal is tomorrow
Night.

1180
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:29,239
Well, then,
Let's postpone it.

1181
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,470
We can't.

1182
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:31,865
Get me a meeting
With the publishers.

1183
00:48:31,876 --> 00:48:33,876
I'll find a way
To change their minds.

1184
00:48:33,878 --> 00:48:35,778
It won't be easy
To convince them, liam.

1185
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,880
Well, i'll find a way
To convince them.

1186
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:39,822
I have to.

1187
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:42,117
They can't do that.

1188
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,620
Unfortunately,
The suits call the shots,

1189
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,691
And they can do
Whatever they want.

1190
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:46,920
But just to cut
All the book reviews?

1191
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:49,055
That-- that doesn't
Even make any sense!

1192
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:50,960
They want more space
For video games and movies.

1193
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:52,532
They're even making me
Create
A whole new section

1194
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:53,930
On celebrity gossip.

1195
00:48:53,932 --> 00:48:56,832
Book reviews just don't
Have enough juice these
Days.

1196
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:59,004
Look, i've been
A team player, phil,

1197
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:00,603
Covering music and movies,

1198
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,335
Whatever you needed,

1199
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,570
But you know the book
Reviews
Are what i love.

1200
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:06,735
That's the reason
I came to the daily.

1201
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:09,314
What can i tell you, sophie?
It's a business.

1202
00:49:09,314 --> 00:49:12,014
Lots of people read books!

1203
00:49:12,016 --> 00:49:13,576
I mean, sure,
It's a changing industry,
But--

1204
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:15,384
No more book reviews.

1205
00:49:15,386 --> 00:49:17,546
I wish
It was different.

1206
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:28,732
Then i don't know
If i can stay.

1207
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,836
I need to figure out
What it is i want to do.

1208
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,975
Well, that's a decision
You're gonna have to make.

1209
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,350
But make it quickly.
I got a paper to run.

1210
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:47,519
[♪♪]

1211
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,492
[sophie]: so you don't think
It's a stupid thing to do?

1212
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:55,932
Not at all,
But it's a big step.

1213
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:57,887
I'm terrified.

1214
00:49:58,962 --> 00:50:00,862
But i think it's what i
Want.

1215
00:50:00,865 --> 00:50:02,595
You were right,
That's what's important.

1216
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,200
Well, it sounds
Like a good plan.

1217
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:05,532
I'm gonna
Go with my gut.

1218
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:07,596
I guess it worked
With you yesterday.

1219
00:50:07,605 --> 00:50:09,165
That's right.

1220
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,713
Look, i-i found out

1221
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:12,938
That i have to go to new
York
For a meeting tomorrow,

1222
00:50:12,944 --> 00:50:14,584
So i'm a little frazzled.
I fly out in a couple of
Hours.

1223
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:16,149
Wait. New york? Why?

1224
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:18,207
Just a contractual thing
I need to address,

1225
00:50:18,216 --> 00:50:19,776
But i have to do it
In person.

1226
00:50:19,784 --> 00:50:20,854
How long will you be gone?

1227
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:22,182
Just overnight.
I'll be back tomorrow.

1228
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,586
Well, do you think

1229
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:26,689
You might be up for a date
Night
Tomorrow night?

1230
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,791
How about an early dinner?
Say, 5:30?

1231
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:31,893
Sure. I'm down
For the early bird special.

1232
00:50:31,896 --> 00:50:33,756
Have a safe flight.

1233
00:50:33,765 --> 00:50:36,695
Okay. Bye.

1234
00:50:36,701 --> 00:50:38,801
Bye.

1235
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,104
That sounds
So romantic.

1236
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:44,206
Dinner
By candlelight?

1237
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:46,178
Yeah. It...it was.

1238
00:50:46,177 --> 00:50:49,047
He told me he was
Falling in love with me,

1239
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:50,977
And then we kissed.

1240
00:50:50,982 --> 00:50:53,382
Wow!

1241
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:56,594
And you want to know
The best part?

1242
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:58,147
I trust him.

1243
00:50:58,156 --> 00:50:59,216
Oh yeah?

1244
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:02,093
Not a "he passed
The test" kind of trust,

1245
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:03,833
A trust where
I want to kick myself

1246
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:05,998
For having ever given him
A test in the first place.

1247
00:51:05,997 --> 00:51:08,457
I never thought
I would

1248
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:10,426
Feel like this
About someone again,

1249
00:51:10,435 --> 00:51:13,195
But he just
Keeps surprising me.

1250
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:14,674
This is so great.

1251
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:16,572
I'm so happy for you.

1252
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:19,384
He's on a trip
To new york for one day,

1253
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:21,137
And i already miss him.

1254
00:51:21,145 --> 00:51:23,405
What am i in, high school?

1255
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,754
You are in love.

1256
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,150
Oh.

1257
00:51:27,151 --> 00:51:30,091
Okay, enough
About my love life.

1258
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:33,588
I have something
I want to show you.

1259
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:34,991
I put it together
Last night,

1260
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:38,032
And you have to promise me
That you will be nice.

1261
00:51:38,029 --> 00:51:40,159
"rivetingreads.com."

1262
00:51:40,164 --> 00:51:41,334
What is it?

1263
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:43,172
My new business.

1264
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:44,397
Your new business?

1265
00:51:44,402 --> 00:51:46,202
What about the paper?

1266
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:49,414
Well, liam said something
To me the other day

1267
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:52,367
About following
My dreams

1268
00:51:52,376 --> 00:51:53,906
And doing what
I want to do,

1269
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:55,411
And i think this might be
It.

1270
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:58,253
This is so fantastic.

1271
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:00,019
I have a meeting
With my editor later,

1272
00:52:00,017 --> 00:52:01,077
And then it goes live.

1273
00:52:01,085 --> 00:52:03,245
Looks like
Liam's good for you.

1274
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:05,554
Mm-hmm.

1275
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:08,016
[♪♪]

1276
00:52:08,025 --> 00:52:09,885
So how are you
Holding up?

1277
00:52:09,894 --> 00:52:11,264
I'm nervous.

1278
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:12,662
Yeah, so am i.

1279
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:14,903
You're not supposed
To admit that to me.

1280
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:15,999
[laughs]

1281
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,430
Liam, i'm not gonna
Sugarcoat this.

1282
00:52:18,436 --> 00:52:19,696
These people are sharks.

1283
00:52:19,704 --> 00:52:21,204
And i don't even know

1284
00:52:21,205 --> 00:52:23,065
If they care enough
To do what you're asking.

1285
00:52:23,074 --> 00:52:25,344
So expectations are low.
All right, then.

1286
00:52:25,343 --> 00:52:28,943
Liam, jackie.
It's great to see you both.

1287
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:31,446
Hey, are you as excited
About the new sales as we
Are?

1288
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:32,749
Um, yeah.

1289
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:33,920
Yeah. You should be.

1290
00:52:33,918 --> 00:52:35,678
Please, have a seat.

1291
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:37,216
So...

1292
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:39,021
What can we do for you?

1293
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:42,423
First off, thank you
So much for your time.

1294
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:45,256
Anything for one
Of our favorite authors.

1295
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:47,903
I'm not so sure
How to put this,

1296
00:52:47,899 --> 00:52:51,029
But for some personal
Reasons,
Um...

1297
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:52,695
I'm asking that you

1298
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:57,173
Reconsider having me
Reveal myself as gabriel
August.

1299
00:52:58,441 --> 00:52:59,781
Uh...

1300
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:02,947
You do know the reveal
Is scheduled for tonight?

1301
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:03,907
Oh...

1302
00:53:03,915 --> 00:53:04,905
I know.

1303
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:07,246
And i'll eventually
Go through with it.

1304
00:53:07,251 --> 00:53:09,551
Just not tonight.

1305
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:10,994
I give you my word.

1306
00:53:10,988 --> 00:53:12,718
Well, we don't really
Need your word, liam.

1307
00:53:12,723 --> 00:53:15,663
We have a contract
That guarantees it.

1308
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,930
Right.

1309
00:53:16,928 --> 00:53:20,558
I just need you to delay
The reveal a few more weeks.

1310
00:53:20,565 --> 00:53:22,455
Liam's not
Being unreasonable.

1311
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:24,226
He's just asking
For more time.

1312
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:26,735
Jackie, he has already
Canceled once.

1313
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:29,307
This has all been timed
To the release of the new
Book.

1314
00:53:29,307 --> 00:53:30,807
We've built
A marketing approach,

1315
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:33,878
Not to mention a substantial
Amount of effort and money,

1316
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:36,178
Around revealing
Gabriel august's identity.

1317
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,110
And obviously,
Once that happens,

1318
00:53:38,115 --> 00:53:40,575
The demands
On liam's personal life

1319
00:53:40,585 --> 00:53:41,615
Are going to be extreme.

1320
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,889
I just need a few more
Weeks.

1321
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,418
That's all i'm asking.

1322
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:48,723
[♪♪]

1323
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,986
Liam.

1324
00:53:50,995 --> 00:53:52,225
They won't do it.

1325
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:53,300
I'm sorry.

1326
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:54,897
I fought for you
In there,

1327
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:56,429
But the machine
Is just too far along

1328
00:53:56,434 --> 00:53:57,504
For them
To stop it now.

1329
00:53:57,501 --> 00:53:58,871
The reveal
Is on for tonight.

1330
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:01,139
I'm really starting
To hate gabriel august.

1331
00:54:01,138 --> 00:54:03,668
You need to talk to sophie.

1332
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:06,114
I'm meeting her for dinner
Tonight at 5:30.

1333
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:07,440
That'll be
Cutting it close.

1334
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:09,705
-we'll make it.
-okay.

1335
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:13,952
Okay, so are we clear

1336
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,281
On the plan
For later tonight?

1337
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:16,846
Jasper's bookloft, 7:30.

1338
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:18,324
Actually, make it 7:00,

1339
00:54:18,322 --> 00:54:20,022
So my blood pressure
Doesn't get too high.

1340
00:54:20,024 --> 00:54:21,124
I'll be there.

1341
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:22,685
Bad news?

1342
00:54:22,693 --> 00:54:24,533
She's got a work meeting.
She just canceled dinner.

1343
00:54:24,528 --> 00:54:25,958
-what are you gonna do?
-find her.

1344
00:54:25,963 --> 00:54:29,533
I have to tell her before
I make the announcement.

1345
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:32,673
You call me!
Let me know how it goes.

1346
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:35,097
[recording]: it's sophie.

1347
00:54:35,106 --> 00:54:37,466
Tell me what's on your mind
After the tone. [beep]

1348
00:54:37,475 --> 00:54:39,235
Hey, sophie.
I got your text.

1349
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:41,743
I'm back in town.
I really need to talk to
You.

1350
00:54:41,746 --> 00:54:43,446
Like, right away,
Face-to-face,

1351
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:47,077
So call me the second
You get this, okay?

1352
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:49,184
I know, but if he said
It was background,

1353
00:54:49,186 --> 00:54:50,446
You got to keep
His name out of it.

1354
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:51,924
That's journalism 101!

1355
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:53,422
Yeah. Okay.

1356
00:54:53,424 --> 00:54:56,034
Okay, let me know
How it shakes out.

1357
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:58,257
Sorry i couldn't
Fit you in earlier.

1358
00:54:58,262 --> 00:55:00,602
I had to keep a reporter
From getting sued.

1359
00:55:00,598 --> 00:55:02,128
What's up?

1360
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:05,173
I wanted to let you know
That today is my last day.

1361
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:09,243
Your last day?

1362
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,110
So you're leaving the paper
?

1363
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:14,208
I'm starting my own website.

1364
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:16,051
One where i get to do

1365
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:19,147
The kind of reviews
That i want to do.

1366
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:21,720
Can you make a living
Doing that?

1367
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:24,919
Well, it may
Take me a few months

1368
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:28,062
To get enough advertisers,
But...

1369
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:31,059
I'm going to give it a try.

1370
00:55:31,062 --> 00:55:33,332
Well, i hate to lose you,
Sophie,

1371
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:35,001
But i have to admit,
I'm a little jealous.

1372
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:36,899
Having the freedom to write
About the things you love

1373
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:38,271
Sounds like the perfect job.

1374
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:39,699
So you're not angry?

1375
00:55:39,704 --> 00:55:44,044
I hope whatever you do next
Makes you happy.

1376
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:48,136
Thank you for everything.

1377
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:50,275
Don't suppose i could

1378
00:55:50,281 --> 00:55:52,011
Talk you into
Showing your gratitude

1379
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:53,216
By giving me an article

1380
00:55:53,217 --> 00:55:54,747
On the gabriel august
Reveal tonight?

1381
00:55:54,752 --> 00:55:56,252
I can't.

1382
00:55:56,253 --> 00:55:59,253

For my own website.

Never
Said i was going to meet
You.

00:58:12,423 --> 00:58:14,523
Stay here.

1424
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:18,262
Hello, sophie.

1425
00:58:18,262 --> 00:58:20,662
Hi, jackie!

1426
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:22,504
How exciting is this?

1427
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,500
Yeah, very,

1428
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:24,701
And a little
Terrifying too.

1429
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:26,972
I can imagine.

1430
00:58:26,971 --> 00:58:29,441
Is he going to show this
Time?

1431
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,510
He's already here.

1432
00:58:30,508 --> 00:58:32,068
It's really happening, then?

1433
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:37,113
Oh, i'm presuming you're
Here
To cover this for your
Paper?

1434
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:38,754
Not exactly.

1435
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:41,079
I'm not
With the daily anymore.

1436
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:42,475
I'm actually here

1437
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:44,386
Covering it
For my own website,

1438
00:58:44,388 --> 00:58:45,818
Which just went online.

1439
00:58:45,823 --> 00:58:47,523
Congratulations.

1440
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:50,185
You let me know if i
Can help in any way.

1441
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:51,564
Thanks.

1442
00:58:51,562 --> 00:58:54,202
I may hold you
To that.

1443
00:58:54,198 --> 00:58:55,728
In fact, um...

1444
00:58:55,733 --> 00:58:59,203
How would you like to
Scoop your old paper?

1445
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:02,643
What are we talking,
Exactly?

1446
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,510
Um, how about

1447
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:08,038
The first real
Exclusive interview

1448
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:10,245
With the real
Gabriel august himself?

1449
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:13,751
Never meant to mislead
You...

1450
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:16,081
I hope that we can--

1451
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:18,790
Liam?

1452
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:19,919
What are you
Doing here?

1453
00:59:19,924 --> 00:59:21,624
Oh, my gosh. You are
Not gonna believe--

1454
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:24,155
Gabriel august
Will be here any minute

1455
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:25,291
To chat with me.

1456
00:59:25,296 --> 00:59:26,556
Jackie got me
An exclusive!

1457
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:28,134
I'll be quick.

1458
00:59:28,132 --> 00:59:29,362
I just need to say

1459
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:31,626
What i wanted
To tell you earlier.

1460
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:33,535
Actually, it's what
I've wanted to tell you

1461
00:59:33,537 --> 00:59:34,537
For a long time.

1462
00:59:34,538 --> 00:59:36,808
Liam, what--
What's going on?

1463
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:38,367
You're the first thing
On my mind

1464
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:40,635
When i wake up in the
Morning,

1465
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:43,214
And the last thing i think
About
When i go to sleep,

1466
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:45,713
And you're in there
A lot in between, too.

1467
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:48,646
So, um, although it's...

1468
00:59:48,652 --> 00:59:51,422
Way past the time
I should have told you this,

1469
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:53,962
Here it goes.

1470
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:55,288
That crowd is here for me.

1471
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:59,256
For you?

1472
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:01,429
I'm gabriel august.

1473
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:02,832
[laughs]

1474
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:05,733
And i'm j.k. Rowling.
Nice to meet you.

1475
01:00:05,736 --> 01:00:07,936
[jackie]: we don't want to
Keep you waiting in suspense

1476
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,368
Any longer.

1477
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:11,643
Ladies and gentlemen,
In a minute,

1478
01:00:11,642 --> 01:00:14,242
It will be my pleasure
To introduce to you,

1479
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:16,514
For the very first time,

1480
01:00:16,513 --> 01:00:19,453
The real man
Behind gabriel august.

1481
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:20,820
I'm sorry.

1482
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:23,588
I didn't want you
To find out this way.

1483
01:00:23,587 --> 01:00:26,687
That's crazy to hear.

1484
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:27,690
You're serious.

1485
01:00:27,691 --> 01:00:29,421
I wanted to tell you before.

1486
01:00:29,426 --> 01:00:30,556
I should have.

1487
01:00:30,561 --> 01:00:32,161
I never meant to hurt you.

1488
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:33,232
I promise.

1489
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,260
How could i
Have missed this?

1490
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:35,234
Sophie, please.

1491
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:37,232
I can't do this.

1492
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:38,404
No, please,
Just let me explain.

1493
01:00:38,402 --> 01:00:39,942
Please talk to me.

1494
01:00:39,937 --> 01:00:41,037
Wait!

1495
01:00:41,038 --> 01:00:43,208
Sophie, i love you.

1496
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:47,141
I need to leave.

1497
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:48,814
I wanted to tell you.
I swear.

1498
01:00:48,812 --> 01:00:50,912
Here he is... Liam bradley!

1499
01:00:50,914 --> 01:00:55,554

1500
01:00:55,552 --> 01:00:58,892
I can't believe
I let this happen again.

So, sophie,
How are you holding up?

1519
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:46,328
I'm fine.

1520
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:47,560
Really.

1521
01:02:47,564 --> 01:02:48,904
So you keep saying.

1522
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:52,369
The new website is
Keeping me super busy.

1523
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:54,539
I still can't believe
He was lying to you

1524
01:02:54,538 --> 01:02:55,668
All that time.

1525
01:02:55,672 --> 01:02:57,942
I can't believe
I didn't see it.

1526
01:02:57,941 --> 01:03:01,141
I mean, i told the guy
About lola.

1527
01:03:01,145 --> 01:03:03,975
You don't think he'll put
That
In some book one day, do
You?

1528
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:06,181
He's probably forgotten
About us already.

1529
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:10,123
He's got plenty
To keep him busy these days.

1530
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,890
I'm not saying
That what he did was okay,

1531
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:14,719
But i can sort of understand
It,
Given the circumstances.

1532
01:03:14,725 --> 01:03:15,885
Honey, you can't
Be serious.

1533
01:03:15,893 --> 01:03:17,363
For all we know,

1534
01:03:17,361 --> 01:03:18,431
He was just using her
To get a good review.

1535
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:19,858
[nina]:
Or maybe he wanted her

1536
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:21,263
To get to know him
As a normal person,

1537
01:03:21,265 --> 01:03:22,855
Not some celebrity author.

1538
01:03:22,866 --> 01:03:24,796
I-i don't know
What to say.

1539
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:27,002
I really liked liam.

1540
01:03:27,004 --> 01:03:29,374
Not too often
I'm wrong about people.

1541
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:31,813
It's not your fault.

1542
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:33,539
It's nobody's fault
But my own.

1543
01:03:33,544 --> 01:03:36,984
I'll bring you a slice
Of lola's cobbler.

1544
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,680
That always makes things
A little better.

1545
01:03:39,683 --> 01:03:41,023
Thanks.

1546
01:03:42,418 --> 01:03:43,718
Look.

1547
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,390
I know it's been
Really rough,

1548
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:46,959
And if i were in
The same place,

1549
01:03:46,957 --> 01:03:48,687
I can't say that
I'd feel any differently,

1550
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:50,492
But it's hard for me
To believe

1551
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:52,294
That he didn't truly
Care about you.

1552
01:03:52,296 --> 01:03:56,866
I'm not sure
What to think anymore.

1553
01:03:56,867 --> 01:03:59,297
But i do know one thing.

1554
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:01,803
I can't go back to this.

1555
01:04:06,642 --> 01:04:08,542
Whatever we had,

1556
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:11,375
It's over now.

1557
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:23,290
[♪♪]

1558
01:04:59,862 --> 01:05:01,962
Hi.

1559
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:08,365
I'm guessing this
Isn't a coincidence.

1560
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:10,412
Well, i remember
You telling me

1561
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:13,407
How much you love
Forest park.

1562
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:15,610
That it was magical...

1563
01:05:15,612 --> 01:05:19,252
Your place to escape.

1564
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:22,019
And...nina told me.

1565
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:23,819
But don't blame her.

1566
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,720
I called and practically
Begged her to help me out.

1567
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:27,792
I just wanted to talk
To you before i go.

1568
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:29,621
You're leaving?

1569
01:05:29,626 --> 01:05:30,856
Going back
To new york.

1570
01:05:30,861 --> 01:05:32,461
I can't be in portland
Without you.

1571
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:35,832
And i can't take back
Being famous now.

1572
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:37,572
But i've been
Thinking a lot lately

1573
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:40,437
About how things
Went with us, and...

1574
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:41,437
And what?

1575
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:43,198
We both made mistakes.

1576
01:05:43,206 --> 01:05:46,806
We each came into this
A little broken in some
Ways.

1577
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,340
But we both know

1578
01:05:48,345 --> 01:05:50,375
We've never felt this way
About anyone before.

1579
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:53,250
If you can find
A way to forgive me,

1580
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,850
I know we can
Work past this.

1581
01:05:55,852 --> 01:05:58,022
I do forgive you, liam.

1582
01:05:58,021 --> 01:06:00,591
So you'll give us
Another chance?

1583
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:08,302
Part of you
Belongs to the world now...

1584
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:11,128
Whether you like it or not,

1585
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:13,344
They're always
Gonna be there.

1586
01:06:13,337 --> 01:06:15,997
I did that before,

1587
01:06:16,006 --> 01:06:18,136
And you know
How badly it ended.

1588
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:20,081
I'm not him.

1589
01:06:20,077 --> 01:06:23,137
I'm liam bradley.

1590
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:24,306
And i love you.

1591
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,384
Don't.

1592
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:28,823
I'm sorry.

1593
01:06:28,819 --> 01:06:30,919
I-i can't do this again.

1594
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:36,589
On that plane
When we first met,

1595
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:39,063
You told me that
First star of evening

1596
01:06:39,062 --> 01:06:40,962
Was good
Because it was honest.

1597
01:06:40,964 --> 01:06:43,404
I probably said
A lot of things.

1598
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,800
I'm sorry if i was--

1599
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:47,001
No. No,
You were right.

1600
01:06:47,004 --> 01:06:48,374
I've spent the last few
Years

1601
01:06:48,372 --> 01:06:50,272
Pretending that
I wasn't gabriel august,

1602
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:51,973
That i was better than that,

1603
01:06:51,975 --> 01:06:54,205
That i was meant
To write real novels

1604
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:56,951
About people's real lives.

1605
01:06:56,947 --> 01:07:00,317
But what's more real than
A love story with a sad
Ending?

1606
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:08,055
I should go.
I have a plane to catch.

1607
01:07:08,058 --> 01:07:09,358
Goodbye, sophie.

1608
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:14,000
[♪♪]

1609
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,779
[woman]: don't
Close the door!

1610
01:07:31,782 --> 01:07:33,852
I'm here.

1611
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:38,024
[♪♪]

1612
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,200
[thinking]: one moment,
He was alone and lost...

1613
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:53,704
And the next...

1614
01:07:53,703 --> 01:07:56,003
She was there,

1615
01:07:56,006 --> 01:07:59,206
Filling the empty seat
Beside him.

1616
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:05,976
[♪♪]

1617
01:08:16,358 --> 01:08:17,358
Oh, my gosh!

1618
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:19,230
You're gabriel august,
Right?

1619
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:20,659
Close enough.

1620
01:08:20,664 --> 01:08:22,434
Do you mind
Signing something for me?

1621
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:23,972
Happy to.

1622
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:28,198
You're gonna miss your cab.

1623
01:08:28,205 --> 01:08:31,805
Oh, there'll always be
Another one.

1624
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:34,736
I think
You're gonna like it.

1625
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:36,144
I know i do.

1626
01:08:36,146 --> 01:08:38,076
That's the first time
I've heard you say that.

1627
01:08:38,081 --> 01:08:39,981
This isn't
Vienna sunset!

1628
01:08:39,983 --> 01:08:41,453
No, it isn't.

1629
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:43,421
And you've put your
Name as the author!

1630
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,120
Noticed that,
Did you?

1631
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:48,122
I know i'm not gonna
Like the answer to this,

1632
01:08:48,125 --> 01:08:49,955
But what happened
To vienna sunset?

1633
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:50,730
Kindling.

1634
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:52,834
[laughing]

1635
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:55,659
Liam! What have you done?

1636
01:08:55,665 --> 01:08:58,025
What i should've done
Before,

1637
01:08:58,034 --> 01:09:00,874
Written something
That's honest and real.

1638
01:09:00,871 --> 01:09:02,371
A book that i believe in,

1639
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:04,672
One that i am proud
To put my name on.

1640
01:09:04,674 --> 01:09:06,844
So i can see we're gonna go

1641
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:08,743
A few more rounds
With harris-kingsfield.

1642
01:09:08,745 --> 01:09:10,575
You up for it?

1643
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:13,050
Ha! Nothin'
I like better.

1644
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:14,579
I can't wait
For you to read it.

1645
01:09:14,584 --> 01:09:16,724
I love seeing you like this.

1646
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,950
Excited and passionate...

1647
01:09:18,955 --> 01:09:20,585
It's been a while.

1648
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:22,560
I feel great, you know?

1649
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,329
Well, as great as i can.

1650
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:25,527
I feel good about the work.

1651
01:09:25,529 --> 01:09:27,959
No word
From sophie?

1652
01:09:27,964 --> 01:09:29,304
No.

1653
01:09:29,299 --> 01:09:30,399
Well, give her time.

1654
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,170
Anything's possible.

1655
01:09:32,169 --> 01:09:33,169
You really think so?

1656
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:35,040
I do.

1657
01:09:35,038 --> 01:09:36,138
Well, i better
Get rolling.

1658
01:09:36,139 --> 01:09:38,209
Let me know what
You think of the book.

1659
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:39,938
You know i will.

1660
01:09:39,943 --> 01:09:42,143
Ahh.

1661
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:50,293
[♪♪]

1662
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:56,092
[inhales sharply,
Sighs]

1663
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:07,301
Hey, hon.

1664
01:10:07,304 --> 01:10:09,874
Cancel all
My appointments today.

1665
01:10:09,873 --> 01:10:14,183
And book me the first flight
Out
To portland.

1666
01:10:14,177 --> 01:10:16,537
Oregon. Thanks.

1667
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:17,746
[beep]

1668
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:21,047
[♪♪]

1669
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,902
I'm pretty sure the plural
Of "goose" is "geese."

1670
01:10:35,899 --> 01:10:38,229
It's not gooses?

1671
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:42,698
You'd think so,
But alas.

1672
01:10:42,706 --> 01:10:43,836
You're the boss.

1673
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,070
How long until

1674
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:47,075
The broken truth chronicles
Review is done?

1675
01:10:47,077 --> 01:10:49,577
Mm. You can't rush genius.

1676
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,579
So how long until

1677
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,821
The broken truth chronicles
Review is done?

1678
01:10:53,817 --> 01:10:55,777
[doorbell chimes]

1679
01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:00,391
Jackie.

1680
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:01,920
Hello, sophie.

1681
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,055
This is such a surprise.

1682
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,860
I don't want to take up
Much of your time,

1683
01:11:05,862 --> 01:11:07,232
But do you have a minute?

1684
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:08,900
This is
Really impressive.

1685
01:11:08,898 --> 01:11:10,028
It's a labor
Of love.

1686
01:11:10,033 --> 01:11:11,033
I've been
Working a lot more

1687
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:12,234
Than i did
At the paper,

1688
01:11:12,235 --> 01:11:15,065
But i like
My boss better.

1689
01:11:15,071 --> 01:11:16,071
[laughs]

1690
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:18,572
You okay
Otherwise?

1691
01:11:18,575 --> 01:11:19,505
[sighs]

1692
01:11:19,509 --> 01:11:21,839
It took a while,
But...

1693
01:11:21,845 --> 01:11:23,605
I think i am now.
I feel good.

1694
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:25,513
I'm happy for you.

1695
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:29,576
It's great seeing you,
Jackie,

1696
01:11:29,586 --> 01:11:31,446
But i am guessing
There's a reason

1697
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,594
You flew all the way
Out to portland.

1698
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:35,660
Liam is still
In love with you, sophie.

1699
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:39,489
Wow! You don't beat
Around the bush, do you?

1700
01:11:39,496 --> 01:11:40,856
Well, i think it's best
To say what i mean,

1701
01:11:40,864 --> 01:11:43,334
And i think you, of all
People,
Would appreciate that.

1702
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:46,026
Did liam put you up to this?

1703
01:11:46,036 --> 01:11:47,736
He would kill me
If he knew i was here.

1704
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:51,208
How's he doing?

1705
01:11:51,207 --> 01:11:52,807
Better.

1706
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:54,679
The first few months
Were difficult.

1707
01:11:54,678 --> 01:11:56,108
It was a lot to get used to.

1708
01:11:56,112 --> 01:11:57,852
I can imagine.

1709
01:11:57,847 --> 01:12:00,647
Women must've been
Throwing themselves at him.

1710
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:04,550
There was only one woman
Whose opinion mattered,

1711
01:12:04,554 --> 01:12:06,594
And she wasn't
In new york.

1712
01:12:06,589 --> 01:12:09,089
Why are you here, jackie?

1713
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:11,162
Liam misses you a lot.

1714
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:14,201
And i'm guessing
That you miss him

1715
01:12:14,197 --> 01:12:15,257
Just as much.

1716
01:12:15,265 --> 01:12:17,065
And...

1717
01:12:17,067 --> 01:12:18,767
I thought you'd
Want to see this.

1718
01:12:18,768 --> 01:12:19,698
What is it?

1719
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:21,343
His new book.

1720
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:23,098
Really?

1721
01:12:23,106 --> 01:12:24,836
A new gabriel august book?

1722
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:26,671
A new liam
Bradley book.

1723
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:28,736
The first,
Actually.

1724
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:31,882
Return to forest park.

1725
01:12:31,881 --> 01:12:33,611
He took your advice,

1726
01:12:33,616 --> 01:12:35,516
He wrote something honest,

1727
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:36,618
Something he believes in.

1728
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:39,389
His book speaks
From his heart.

1729
01:12:39,389 --> 01:12:42,519
And he dedicated
It to...

1730
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:44,885
Someone
Very special to him.

1731
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:49,098
Take care, sophie.

1732
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:54,938
[♪♪]

1733
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:21,358
We finally
Put a face to gabriel
August...

1734
01:13:21,364 --> 01:13:23,004
And now you want
To kill him off?

1735
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:27,569
Oh, i wouldn't put it
Quite that way,

1736
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,570
That is precisely
What we want.

1737
01:13:29,572 --> 01:13:31,612
The book that he was
Contractually obligated

1738
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:32,568
To give us

1739
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,205
Is not
A gabriel august novel.

1740
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:37,210
Actually, if you look
At the contract closely,

1741
01:13:37,213 --> 01:13:38,313
I think you'll find

1742
01:13:38,314 --> 01:13:39,654
That liam bradley
Owes you a new book,

1743
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:41,079
Not gabriel august.

1744
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:44,554
Gabriel august
Is liam bradley.

1745
01:13:44,554 --> 01:13:45,524
Liam.

1746
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:48,215
Where's vienna sunset?

1747
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:50,394
The ashes might still be in
The fireplace in portland.

1748
01:13:50,393 --> 01:13:53,393
[jackie]: i don't think
It's gonna do you much good.

1749
01:13:53,396 --> 01:13:55,926
But we think you are gonna
Love
Liam bradley's new book.

1750
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:58,172
[liam]: ted, i understand
This is a business,

1751
01:13:58,168 --> 01:14:02,138
And your profit
Is the bottom line, correct?

1752
01:14:02,138 --> 01:14:03,568
Correct.

1753
01:14:03,573 --> 01:14:05,643
[liam]: then i hope we have
Some good news for you.

1754
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:07,612
You know i'm a fan

1755
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:10,180
Of test-marketing
My clients' new books.

1756
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:11,650
To be perfectly blunt,

1757
01:14:11,648 --> 01:14:13,548
I found liam's new book

1758
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:15,950
Emotional
And incredibly gripping.

1759
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:19,592
So i commissioned
A market evaluation
Research,

1760
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:21,459
And the results
Are in your hands.

1761
01:14:23,392 --> 01:14:26,132
It achieved the highest
Rating

1762
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:29,059
Of any book
They've ever tested.

1763
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:31,965
You know, market research
Doesn't guarantee success.

1764
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:33,838
It's the book business, ted!

1765
01:14:33,837 --> 01:14:36,267
There is no guarantee
Of success.

1766
01:14:36,272 --> 01:14:39,872
But this is as close as it
Gets.

1767
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:42,076
It comes down to this.

1768
01:14:42,078 --> 01:14:44,148
Gabriel august
As we all knew him

1769
01:14:44,147 --> 01:14:45,247
Doesn't exist anymore.

1770
01:14:45,248 --> 01:14:47,718
Liam bradley does.

1771
01:14:47,717 --> 01:14:49,047
And to be honest,

1772
01:14:49,052 --> 01:14:51,322
I feel like
I'm just getting started.

1773
01:14:51,321 --> 01:14:53,751
I want harris-kingsfield
Along for the ride,

1774
01:14:53,756 --> 01:14:56,456
But one way or the other...

1775
01:14:56,459 --> 01:14:58,189
I'm still moving forward.

1776
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:02,655
[♪♪]

1777
01:15:06,702 --> 01:15:08,642
I'm sorry.

1778
01:15:08,638 --> 01:15:11,368
No, it's okay.

1779
01:15:11,374 --> 01:15:13,414
I feel like
It's all my fault.

1780
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:15,979
If i hadn't introduced
You to liam,

1781
01:15:15,979 --> 01:15:17,949
You never would've
Told him about lola.

1782
01:15:17,947 --> 01:15:19,777
I can't believe

1783
01:15:19,782 --> 01:15:23,922
He wrote this
In his book.

1784
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,890
It's okay.

1785
01:15:24,888 --> 01:15:27,048
No, it's--
It's not.

1786
01:15:27,056 --> 01:15:29,556
Sophie...

1787
01:15:29,559 --> 01:15:32,359
I told him it was okay.

1788
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:34,302
Liam called me.

1789
01:15:34,297 --> 01:15:37,297
He asked
My permission.

1790
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,600
He...

1791
01:15:38,601 --> 01:15:41,041
You talked to him?

1792
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:43,537
He's a good man.

1793
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:46,070
I know you two had
Your problems.

1794
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:49,075
He's a decent guy.

1795
01:15:49,078 --> 01:15:51,278
He...

1796
01:15:51,281 --> 01:15:54,251
Made me look
Handsome and sexy,

1797
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,380
Like i told him to.

1798
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,090
How could he not?

1799
01:16:00,089 --> 01:16:01,289
So?

1800
01:16:01,291 --> 01:16:02,591
How is it?

1801
01:16:02,592 --> 01:16:04,662
It's beautiful.

1802
01:16:04,661 --> 01:16:07,501
And smart,

1803
01:16:07,497 --> 01:16:10,627
And funny, but so sad.

1804
01:16:10,633 --> 01:16:12,703
Uh...

1805
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:15,969
It's liam.

1806
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:22,413
When you were
Going out with james,

1807
01:16:22,412 --> 01:16:24,012
I kept my mouth shut.

1808
01:16:24,013 --> 01:16:26,513
Figured you knew
What you were doing

1809
01:16:26,516 --> 01:16:27,846
Without my help.

1810
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:31,490
You couldn't have
Been more wrong.

1811
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:35,417
To know much
About relationships.

1812
01:16:35,425 --> 01:16:38,185
I only loved

1813
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:40,834
One woman in my life.

1814
01:16:40,830 --> 01:16:43,600
You found
Your one true love.

1815
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,770
I know that now.

1816
01:16:46,769 --> 01:16:49,869
But when lola and i
Were together,

1817
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:53,212
It wasn't always
So clear.

1818
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:56,879
Loving someone's

1819
01:16:56,879 --> 01:16:59,349
The hardest work
There is.

1820
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:02,075
Oh, i messed up plenty,

1821
01:17:02,085 --> 01:17:03,775
So did she.

1822
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:06,816
We disappointed
Each other sometimes,

1823
01:17:06,823 --> 01:17:09,693
We said things
We regretted later,

1824
01:17:09,692 --> 01:17:13,232
But...

1825
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:17,026
We never

1826
01:17:17,033 --> 01:17:20,973
Let that
Keep us apart,

1827
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:26,740
No matter how bad things
Seemed at the time.

1828
01:17:26,743 --> 01:17:36,453
It wasn't true love
Because it was easy.

1829
01:17:36,452 --> 01:17:38,522
We fought for it.

1830
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:43,416
What am i supposed to do?

1831
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:46,659
[sighs]

1832
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:53,071
You're the only person
That can answer that.

1833
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,696
[♪♪]

1834
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:31,141
So?

1835
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:34,240
Do i finally have
A happy author?

1836
01:18:34,243 --> 01:18:35,483
They're all
Out there for you.

1837
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:37,178
The real you.

1838
01:18:37,180 --> 01:18:38,380
Thanks to you.

1839
01:18:38,381 --> 01:18:40,181
You made
All this happen.

1840
01:18:40,183 --> 01:18:41,883
Well, that's sweet,

1841
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:46,054
But this had very
Little to do with me.

1842
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:49,255
Your parents
Would have been so proud.

1843
01:18:49,258 --> 01:18:50,788
You think so?

1844
01:18:50,793 --> 01:18:52,893
I know it.

1845
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:56,355
So, do i have to drag you
Kicking and screaming

1846
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:58,065
Out onto
The stage again?

1847
01:18:58,067 --> 01:18:59,597
No.

1848
01:18:59,602 --> 01:19:01,102
This time,

1849
01:19:01,104 --> 01:19:02,804
I'm actually
Looking forward to it.

1850
01:19:02,805 --> 01:19:04,205
Shall we?

1851
01:19:04,207 --> 01:19:06,837
Let's go knock 'em
Dead, kiddo.

1852
01:19:08,844 --> 01:19:11,154
[crowd chatting quietly]

1853
01:19:13,648 --> 01:19:15,418
Thank you for coming out.

1854
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:17,118
[applause]
Thank you.

1855
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,787
I know this is a bit
Unusual,

1856
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:23,890
But we have some wonderful
News
To share with you today.

1857
01:19:23,893 --> 01:19:26,363
You recently
Met this gentleman

1858
01:19:26,362 --> 01:19:29,732
As the author behind
The gabriel august novels,

1859
01:19:29,732 --> 01:19:33,602
But today, we're here to
Talk
About an exciting new
Direction.

1860
01:19:33,603 --> 01:19:35,673
I'll let him
Tell you all about it.

1861
01:19:35,671 --> 01:19:38,841
Ladies and gentlemen,
Liam bradley.

1862
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:41,781
[applauding]

1863
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:49,583
I love writing.

1864
01:19:49,585 --> 01:19:51,585
From as far back
As i can remember,

1865
01:19:51,587 --> 01:19:52,917
I was scribbling things
Down.

1866
01:19:52,922 --> 01:19:54,122
I've been very fortunate

1867
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:55,393
To find people like you

1868
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,591
Who actually want
To read what i wrote.

1869
01:19:56,592 --> 01:20:00,432
[applause]

1870
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:03,059
But for too long,
I've stayed in the shadows.

1871
01:20:03,065 --> 01:20:06,225
Well, i'm happy, and...

1872
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:09,795
Actually pretty nervous...

1873
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:12,006
To say
That those days are done.

1874
01:20:12,008 --> 01:20:14,738
My new book is called
Return to forest park,

1875
01:20:14,744 --> 01:20:15,944
And as you can see,

1876
01:20:15,945 --> 01:20:18,745
The only name on it
Is mine.

1877
01:20:18,748 --> 01:20:20,278
Yes, sir?

1878
01:20:20,283 --> 01:20:23,583
So, are you just continuing
The gabriel august romances

1879
01:20:23,586 --> 01:20:25,246
Under a new name?

1880
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:26,724
Not at all.

1881
01:20:26,722 --> 01:20:28,762
There is some romance in it,
But this book is different.

1882
01:20:28,758 --> 01:20:30,558
It's more
A novel of discovery,

1883
01:20:30,560 --> 01:20:32,590
About a man
Finally finding himself.

1884
01:20:32,595 --> 01:20:33,825
Is it autobiographical?

1885
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:35,160
I refuse to answer that

1886
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,534
On the grounds
That i may incriminate
Myself.

1887
01:20:37,533 --> 01:20:38,473
[audience chuckling]

1888
01:20:38,467 --> 01:20:40,897
Let's just say it's honest.

1889
01:20:40,903 --> 01:20:41,903
Yes, miss?

1890
01:20:41,904 --> 01:20:42,874
Does this mean
You've walked away

1891
01:20:42,872 --> 01:20:44,372
From your deal
With harris-kingsfield?

1892
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:45,773
No. I'm thrilled
To be staying

1893
01:20:45,775 --> 01:20:47,505
Under the harris-kingsfield
Umbrella.

1894
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:48,880
They've been
Incredibly supportive,

1895
01:20:48,878 --> 01:20:50,638
And i look forward
To a long future together.

1896
01:20:50,646 --> 01:20:52,846
[sophie]:
Mr. Bradley, it sounds

1897
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:54,419
Like return to forest park

1898
01:20:54,417 --> 01:20:57,687
Is more personal than
Your previous novels.

1899
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:00,217
It does.

1900
01:21:00,223 --> 01:21:02,163
I've learned a lot
Over this past year,

1901
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:06,388
And i hope that shows
In this new book.

1902
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:09,325
I'd say it's the most
Personal
Book i've ever written.

1903
01:21:09,332 --> 01:21:10,832
It must be hard,

1904
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:15,103
Being thrust into the
Spotlight
Like this.

1905
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:17,544
Are you worried
That it might change you?

1906
01:21:17,540 --> 01:21:19,470
Change isn't always
A bad thing.

1907
01:21:19,475 --> 01:21:22,135
I know i've been
Changing a lot lately.

1908
01:21:22,144 --> 01:21:24,254
Sure, all this is
Challenging,

1909
01:21:24,247 --> 01:21:26,207
But i've finally
Learned to be comfortable

1910
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,515
In being liam bradley.

1911
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:32,745
And what you see
Is what you get.

1912
01:21:32,755 --> 01:21:35,155
Can your fans count on that?

1913
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,693
My fans can rest assured

1914
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:43,826
That i would never do
Anything
To hurt them.

1915
01:21:43,833 --> 01:21:48,073
Because some of us still
Have
Deep-seated trust issues

1916
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,600
That we're working through.

1917
01:21:49,605 --> 01:21:50,965
And i'd like to
Help with those

1918
01:21:50,973 --> 01:21:53,073
Any way that i can.

1920
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:58,879
Are you sure
You're up for it?

1921
01:21:58,881 --> 01:22:01,821
Absolutely.

1922
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:04,487
It may take
A while.

1923
01:22:04,487 --> 01:22:07,017
That's fine by me.

1924
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,616
'Cause i hope to spend

1925
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:11,855
Every day
For the rest of my life

1926
01:22:11,861 --> 01:22:14,631
Showing my fans
Just how much i love them.

1927
01:22:14,630 --> 01:22:17,260
You want to get
Your camera ready.

1928
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:19,696
I think you're gonna want
To get a shot of this.

1929
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:25,369
Speaking as
A big fan myself...

1930
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:28,814
That sounds like
A wonderful new chapter.

Is right here.
