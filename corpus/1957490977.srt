00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,498
[haunting organ music]

3
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:58,956
[tense music]

4
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:12,403
[Michael] So tell me your
deepest, darkest secret.

5
00:01:13,637 --> 00:01:14,539
[Gabby] Pass.

6
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:15,306
[Michael] Come on, pass?

7
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:16,573
I want to know.

8
00:01:16,606 --> 00:01:18,176
[Gabby] I don't
want you to know.

9
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:20,511
Come on, let's take these in.

10
00:01:20,545 --> 00:01:23,548
[Michael chuckling]

11
00:01:33,923 --> 00:01:34,723
Wow.

12
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:36,826
It's bigger than I expected.

13
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:38,495
Yeah, I used to love
coming here as a kid.

14
00:01:38,528 --> 00:01:39,695
Which way's our room?

15
00:01:39,728 --> 00:01:42,332
I want to unpack before
we do anything else.

16
00:01:42,365 --> 00:01:43,467
You trust me, right?

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,967
Yeah, of course.

18
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,103
Then tell me.

19
00:01:46,136 --> 00:01:48,037
No, thank you.

20
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,040
I assume the master
bedroom is upstairs?

21
00:01:51,073 --> 00:01:51,873
Yeah.

22
00:02:01,983 --> 00:02:03,452
Not gonna happen, big guy.

23
00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:04,986
I'll tell you mine
if you tell me yours.

24
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,155
Final offer.

25
00:02:06,188 --> 00:02:07,523
I don't want to know yours.

26
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:08,990
I want us to like each other.

27
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,392
[Michael] Hey, I
believe as of Monday,

28
00:02:10,426 --> 00:02:12,759
we now love each other.

29
00:02:12,793 --> 00:02:14,728
Mhmm, and I want
to keep it that way.

30
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:17,965
I just figured that if
we're ready to go away

31
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:19,833
for a weekend together,

32
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:20,767
that we're ready
to tell each other

33
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:21,969
these kinds of things, huh?

34
00:02:22,003 --> 00:02:23,371
Oh yeah, is that
what you just figured?

35
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:24,606
It makes sense to me.

36
00:02:24,638 --> 00:02:25,607
I'm sure it does.

37
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:28,143
So let's do it.

38
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:29,577
Let's do it, let's get heavy.

39
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:31,479
I don't want to
get heavy, Michael.

40
00:02:31,513 --> 00:02:32,713
I want to nest.

41
00:02:32,746 --> 00:02:35,416
This is my favorite
part about going away.

42
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,649
It is?

43
00:02:36,682 --> 00:02:38,751
Mhmm, getting cozy
somewhere unfamiliar.

44
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,287
What's your favorite part?

45
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,255
The going away.

46
00:02:43,023 --> 00:02:44,458
Come on, let's take a break.

47
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:46,226
Oh, let's have a drink.

48
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,494
We just drove like six hours.

49
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:49,129
[Gabby] Can I get a
20 minute raincheck?

50
00:02:49,163 --> 00:02:51,365
No, you may not.

51
00:02:51,398 --> 00:02:53,367
House rules, actually.

52
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,835
First, a tour, then a drink.

53
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:57,737
Then the chores.

54
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,572
House rules?

55
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:02,275
10 minutes, then you
can show me around.

56
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:03,543
No can do.

57
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:04,943
You are already on the tour.

58
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,380
First stop, the master bedroom

59
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:09,948
where I hope to make a
considerable impression.

60
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:13,752
Oh, I see, you brought
me up here to seduce me.

61
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:15,254
It's also a house rule

62
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:17,089
to get seduced
during your stay, so.

63
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:19,891
Well I bet that made the
family trips pretty awkward.

64
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:23,362
It did.

65
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:25,530
Back here behind you
is the back patio.

66
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:26,864
This is the upper balcony.

67
00:03:27,932 --> 00:03:29,100
The view is killer.

68
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:32,337
Staircase connects these
patios on each floor.

69
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:34,805
Back through here

70
00:03:34,838 --> 00:03:38,876
is the most luxurious
bathroom in the world

71
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:42,447
for all your nose powdering
needs and whatnot.

72
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:48,185
Through here are
some spare bedrooms.

73
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,886
Bathroom at the end of the hall.

74
00:03:56,594 --> 00:03:59,063
[light music]

75
00:04:14,344 --> 00:04:16,079
[Gabby] Can't
get over the decor.

76
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:18,448
Yeah, grandparents
have good taste.

77
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:20,183
[Gabby] Ooh, I'd say.

78
00:04:20,216 --> 00:04:21,551
Ah, help yourself.

79
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:24,687
There's a fireplace,
sitting area.

80
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:25,954
This is where the
kids always played

81
00:04:25,988 --> 00:04:27,523
while the adults got drunk.

82
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:32,996
And here is another back patio.

83
00:04:37,299 --> 00:04:39,101
I used to love sitting out
here and looking at deer

84
00:04:39,134 --> 00:04:41,103
and stuff.

85
00:04:43,472 --> 00:04:44,306
Thanks.

86
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:47,908
Oh, and here is
where I will showcase

87
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:51,413
my second most
memorable skillset.

88
00:04:51,446 --> 00:04:52,813
[Gabby] You better.

89
00:04:52,847 --> 00:04:54,283
You better. I did not come
all this way for TV dinners.

90
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:56,784
Don't worry, we're
feasting this weekend.

91
00:04:56,817 --> 00:04:58,919
[glasses clinking]

92
00:04:58,953 --> 00:04:59,853
Oh, hang on.

93
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:02,123
Through here are

94
00:05:03,624 --> 00:05:06,294
just some extra
bedrooms. [chuckling]

95
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:08,763
It's where the
kids always stayed.

96
00:05:08,795 --> 00:05:10,131
Yeah, you know,
I think that this

97
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:11,865
is the most exciting
part of the tour so far.

98
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:15,303
Well, it's where the magic
happens, so. [chuckling]

99
00:05:15,336 --> 00:05:16,170
[Gabby] Okay.

100
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:20,141
Down here is the den.

101
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:25,312
It's got an entertainment
center, which is pretty cool

102
00:05:25,345 --> 00:05:28,448
but there's no cable
or internet up here.

103
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:31,484
So we're kind of stuck with my
grandparents' DVD collection.

104
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,421
Hope you don't mind.

105
00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:41,428
And this is a bathroom.

106
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:44,963
And this is the last bedroom.

107
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,202
I used to come hide in here
whenever I wanted to be alone.

108
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:51,236
Never worked though.

109
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:55,541
That's a back patio
on the ground floor

110
00:05:55,574 --> 00:05:58,077
and that's pretty much it.

111
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,116
[Gabby] I'm so jealous you
got to come here as a kid.

112
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:05,384
[Michael] You should be.

113
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:06,884
I mean, it was awesome.

114
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:09,388
[Gabby] Well, there is
actually one perk from me

115
00:06:09,421 --> 00:06:11,823
that you never had
on any of your trips.

116
00:06:11,855 --> 00:06:13,658
[Michael] And what is that?

117
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:17,095
The world's most amazing
and handsome tour guide.

118
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:18,596
Ooh, now who's
seducing who, huh?

119
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,398
I'm just calling
it how I see it.

120
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,507
Love?

121
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,375
Love.

122
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:32,976
Oh, there's one more thing

123
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,579
that I've not told
you about this room.

124
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:35,746
[Gabby] What's that?

125
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:36,847
This is the place
where you tell me

126
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,048
your deepest, darkest secret.

127
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:39,049
[Gabby] Hey.

128
00:06:39,082 --> 00:06:40,250
We were having a nice moment.

129
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:42,252
We still are.

130
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:43,220
Nope.

131
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:44,688
Not having this conversation.

132
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,490
I just want to enjoy
each other's company

133
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:47,758
and be in love.

134
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,394
Isn't telling each other
these kinds of things

135
00:06:50,427 --> 00:06:51,862
a part of being in love?

136
00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:53,296
[Gabby] Okay, this isn't
like when you asked me

137
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,897
my most embarrassing moments.

138
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,066
That I could handle.

139
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:57,200
Oh, you can handle this.

140
00:06:57,234 --> 00:06:58,201
Come on.

141
00:06:58,235 --> 00:06:59,269
I believe in you.

142
00:07:00,403 --> 00:07:03,372
Yeah, well, it's
not fun stuff.

143
00:07:03,406 --> 00:07:05,307
I want to know
everything about you.

144
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,542
Not just some fun stuff.

145
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:13,182
[Gabby] Another time?

146
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,584
You love me, right?

147
00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:17,620
[Gabby] Very much.

148
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:19,088
[Michael] And you trust me?

149
00:07:20,423 --> 00:07:21,257
[Gabby] Yeah.

150
00:07:22,258 --> 00:07:23,957
Then what's the hold up?

151
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:25,493
I don't want to.

152
00:07:25,527 --> 00:07:26,761
Okay?

153
00:07:26,795 --> 00:07:27,928
Look, things are
going well here.

154
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:29,330
I don't need to give you reasons

155
00:07:29,364 --> 00:07:30,931
to rethink this half a
day's drive from home.

156
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:32,400
Oh my God.

157
00:07:32,434 --> 00:07:34,369
Is what we have so
superficial that you think

158
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:37,305
you can tear it up just
with one little story?

159
00:07:38,873 --> 00:07:40,408
Probably not.

160
00:07:40,442 --> 00:07:41,743
Then let's do it.

161
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:43,244
Come on, let's get heavy.

162
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:45,914
Let's get vulnerable.

163
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:47,315
Vulnerable?

164
00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:48,182
Yeah.

165
00:07:50,217 --> 00:07:52,553
Okay, fine.

166
00:07:52,586 --> 00:07:54,455
If it means that much to you.

167
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:55,856
Okay, awesome.

168
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,891
So our last stop on the tour

169
00:07:57,925 --> 00:07:59,626
is Gabby's memories.

170
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,828
Oh wait, what's yours?

171
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:02,362
You said that you would
tell me yours first.

172
00:08:02,396 --> 00:08:03,564
But I said that
like 20 minutes ago.

173
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:05,132
So it's not really
that big of a-

174
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:06,633
- You said, so

175
00:08:06,667 --> 00:08:08,602
I'm cashing in on that
offer fair and square.

176
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:11,338
Okay.

177
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:12,605
But you have to promise me

178
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:13,673
that you're going
to tell me after.

179
00:08:21,414 --> 00:08:22,248
Okay.

180
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:24,417
So when I was in college,

181
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:26,819
I was in this play, right?

182
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:27,820
I played a soldier.

183
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:29,322
The costume was legit.

184
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:31,691
And so in between
semesters, I had to fly home

185
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:34,360
and I got the bright idea

186
00:08:34,393 --> 00:08:36,628
to wear my costume
to the airport.

187
00:08:36,661 --> 00:08:38,029
I never thought it would work.

188
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:39,164
It did work.

189
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:40,765
And not only for
getting onto the plane,

190
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,135
but once I was on there,

191
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:46,738
a lady got up and
offered me her seat.

192
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:50,208
And that is still the only time
I've ever flown first class.

193
00:08:50,242 --> 00:08:53,945
[chuckling] It's not that bad.

194
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,647
Of course it is.

195
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,649
You can't impersonate the
military in real life.

196
00:08:57,682 --> 00:08:59,650
It's like a crime or something.

197
00:08:59,683 --> 00:09:01,752
I mean, I wouldn't put that
on your resume or anything.

198
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:04,922
But if that is your
deepest, darkest secret,

199
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:06,323
you're pretty clean, dude.

200
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:09,126
Yeah, I can't tell you mine now.

201
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:09,960
It's a way worse.

202
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:11,161
Nuh uh, you promised.

203
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:13,230
You can't prove that
in a court of law.

204
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:15,232
Hey, I trusted you.

205
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,334
Okay.

206
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:22,273
[somber piano music]

207
00:09:23,806 --> 00:09:26,809
So do you remember
how I told you

208
00:09:26,843 --> 00:09:29,980
my mom had died unexpectedly
a few years back?

209
00:09:30,847 --> 00:09:32,048
Sure.

210
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:34,817
Well, it wasn't
that unexpected.

211
00:09:34,851 --> 00:09:36,519
Oh my God, you
killed your mom.

212
00:09:36,553 --> 00:09:37,787
That is way worse than my story.

213
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,024
- You're right.
- No, you goof.

214
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:43,860
But I knew she was dying.

215
00:09:45,328 --> 00:09:48,764
Well, she told me she was,
but I didn't believe her.

216
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:54,269
She was a drinker since
way before I was born.

217
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,504
I'm sure you can
fill in the blanks

218
00:09:55,537 --> 00:09:56,638
of what that was like.

219
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,176
So I left home as
soon as possible,

220
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:02,411
moved across the country,

221
00:10:02,444 --> 00:10:04,613
tried my best not
to have any contact,

222
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,950
but every once in a
while she would call me

223
00:10:07,984 --> 00:10:10,485
with some melodramatic problem
that could only be fixed

224
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,987
by me agreeing to see her.

225
00:10:13,588 --> 00:10:16,824
This one time she called
and said it was cancer.

226
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:22,463
She wanted to apologize
to me in person,

227
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,098
leave the earth on a high note.

228
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:28,070
Always bullshit.

229
00:10:28,102 --> 00:10:28,936
Always.

230
00:10:32,473 --> 00:10:34,742
But this time...

231
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:43,817
Anyways, I told her to
stop calling me as usual.

232
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,219
And a month later I get a
phone call from my sister

233
00:10:46,252 --> 00:10:48,089
with funeral dates.

234
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:49,389
You couldn't have known.

235
00:10:49,422 --> 00:10:52,158
Well, I shouldn't
have taken the chance.

236
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:54,828
It's a big step up from
killing her though, right?

237
00:10:54,861 --> 00:10:57,631
Hey, will you take
me to one last spot

238
00:10:57,664 --> 00:10:59,399
before we conclude the tour?

239
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:00,933
Yeah, where's that?

240
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:03,302
Whatever the best spot is
in this place to get stoned.

241
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,272
[chuckling] I'm glad you
let me twist your arm.

242
00:11:07,306 --> 00:11:08,741
I'm not like a total
square or anything.

243
00:11:08,774 --> 00:11:10,576
I just haven't
smoked since college.

244
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:13,013
You know, I'm not
like as stoner, right?

245
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:14,546
I just thought this would be fun

246
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,648
to do together this weekend.

247
00:11:15,681 --> 00:11:17,050
And you were right.

248
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,283
I was right.

249
00:11:18,317 --> 00:11:20,619
This will be a
weekend to remember.

250
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:21,453
I could feel it.

251
00:11:21,487 --> 00:11:22,521
[Gabby] I hope so.

252
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,524
You feel significant.

253
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:29,694
This feels significant.

254
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:32,530
That is just the weed.

255
00:11:32,563 --> 00:11:34,298
All I know is that
you make me feel things

256
00:11:34,332 --> 00:11:36,334
I didn't know people
actually felt.

257
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:37,969
Yeah?

258
00:11:38,003 --> 00:11:38,836
Yeah.

259
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,609
[Gabby laughing]

260
00:11:44,642 --> 00:11:46,277
[Gabby] Oh my god.

261
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:50,847
[Michael laughing]

262
00:11:59,991 --> 00:12:01,758
This is unparalleled.

263
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:02,994
You're the sweetest man.

264
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:05,862
You are overwhelming.

265
00:12:05,896 --> 00:12:06,930
Look at me.

266
00:12:06,963 --> 00:12:07,864
I am looking at you.

267
00:12:07,898 --> 00:12:09,399
No, I mean, look at me.

268
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:13,103
I want us to see each other,
really see each other.

269
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:14,537
Okay.

270
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,839
No, no, no, don't
stop looking at me.

271
00:12:16,872 --> 00:12:17,873
I love you.

272
00:12:17,907 --> 00:12:19,308
I love you too.

273
00:12:19,341 --> 00:12:20,509
Then keep on looking at me.

274
00:12:20,543 --> 00:12:21,444
Do you trust me?

275
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:22,445
Yeah, of course.

276
00:12:22,478 --> 00:12:23,512
Not of course,
it's dismissive.

277
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:25,681
Soul to soul, do you trust me?

278
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:27,349
I mean you haven't given
me any reason not to.

279
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:28,684
I'm not asking about
giving you a reason not to.

280
00:12:28,718 --> 00:12:31,487
I'm asking if you trust
me, different question.

281
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,755
Don't stop looking at me.

282
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:33,689
I'm looking at you.

283
00:12:33,723 --> 00:12:35,757
No no no, deeper, look deeper.

284
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,758
Do you trust me?

285
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:37,959
Michael.

286
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:39,627
No, no don't
overcomplicate it.

287
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:41,429
Soul to soul, look at me.

288
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,965
Do you trust me?

289
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:44,833
[Gabby] Yes.

290
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:46,868
Completely?

291
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:47,769
[Gabby] Yes, completely.

292
00:12:49,237 --> 00:12:50,605
Good.

293
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:52,307
I just want to know what's
going on in that head of yours.

294
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,775
That's not being in the moment,
that's being in your head.

295
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:55,044
I need you here with me.

296
00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:55,944
Okay? This is important.

297
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:56,745
I love you.

298
00:12:57,846 --> 00:12:59,780
Oh God, you are not proposing.

299
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:00,748
[Michael] No, don't
worry about that now,

300
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,249
just look at me in the eyes.

301
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:03,250
Let's go back to dancing.

302
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,384
This is a kind of dance.

303
00:13:04,418 --> 00:13:05,452
You're cute.

304
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:06,553
I like the dancing we
were doing before better.

305
00:13:06,587 --> 00:13:07,287
Here.

306
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:09,890
There, happy now?

307
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:12,760
This is important to me.

308
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:13,995
Don't wonder about why,

309
00:13:14,028 --> 00:13:15,997
or what we were doing
or what I might do.

310
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,332
There's only right now, okay?

311
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,833
I'm so confused.

312
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,368
That's okay, because you
love me and you trust me

313
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,436
and you won't stop
looking at me.

314
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,703
This as a little intense.

315
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,038
I know, but it has to happen.

316
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:26,339
What has to happen?

317
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,343
I don't know.

318
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,212
I dunno, it's hard to
explain, but it's something.

319
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:33,446
You have to look at me.

320
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,680
[Gabby] But I
don't understand.

321
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,849
Right now, there are
only your eyes, my eyes

322
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,919
and the souls behind them,
gazing at each other.

323
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:43,023
Gabby, this is the most important
night of your entire life.

324
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:46,659
If you love me, and trust me,

325
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,294
I need you to look at me.

326
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:50,862
Okay.

327
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:53,232
Yes, yes, you're getting it.

328
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,066
I love you.

329
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,968
I love you.

330
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:58,271
This is bigger
than the both of us.

331
00:13:58,303 --> 00:13:59,504
[Gabby] What are
you talking about?

332
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,338
This, something.

333
00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:01,573
Something is happening.

334
00:14:01,606 --> 00:14:02,507
Michael, you're
scaring me a little.

335
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:03,708
That's okay, that's okay.

336
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,144
Because everything
is as it needs to be.

337
00:14:07,412 --> 00:14:08,214
Look at me.

338
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,481
I am.

339
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:11,682
No, don't just look
at me with your eyes.

340
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:12,550
That's it.

341
00:14:13,985 --> 00:14:15,586
I love you.

342
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:16,453
I love you.

343
00:14:17,721 --> 00:14:19,824
Gabrielle, listen to me.

344
00:14:19,857 --> 00:14:20,691
God is here.

345
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:23,928
As in like "God is love?"

346
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:25,362
No, God, God.

347
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:27,065
The God.

348
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:28,833
I didn't know
you were religious.

349
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:32,003
I don't know why I said that.

350
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:34,338
Because he's here.

351
00:14:34,371 --> 00:14:36,439
He is here.

352
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:38,541
Okay, I guess
God is everywhere

353
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:39,542
if you believe in that

354
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:40,710
- sort of thing.
- No, no.

355
00:14:40,743 --> 00:14:41,511
It's much more
specific than that.

356
00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:42,812
He's here right now.

357
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,183
Okay, well, where's
he hiding now?

358
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,621
Do not recognize your Lord?

359
00:14:58,795 --> 00:14:59,996
What is this?

360
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:00,964
[The Lord] An opportunity.

361
00:15:02,564 --> 00:15:04,033
What are you saying exactly?

362
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,335
You know what's
happening here.

363
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,835
You're only phrasing
it as a question

364
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:08,937
because you don't
like the answer.

365
00:15:08,972 --> 00:15:11,241
Are you trying to
tell me you're God?

366
00:15:11,274 --> 00:15:13,276
Not trying, I am.

367
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:14,277
No.

368
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,612
Nope, I don't like this game.

369
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:18,047
There's no game.

370
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:20,782
You and I need to have a
somewhat intense conversation.

371
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:22,018
Okay.

372
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:23,252
I am too high for
this right now.

373
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:24,685
You are freaking me out.

374
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:26,221
I know, kid.

375
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:27,722
Unfortunately, there's not
really a way around that.

376
00:15:27,755 --> 00:15:29,857
But in matters of extreme
urgency such as this one

377
00:15:29,891 --> 00:15:31,559
it's the only way.

378
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:33,394
Okay, Michael,
what's happening here?

379
00:15:33,427 --> 00:15:34,495
Michael isn't present.

380
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:35,696
This isn't going to be
what you want to hear

381
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:36,631
but it is the truth.

382
00:15:36,664 --> 00:15:38,432
There is a God.

383
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:40,002
And right now he's
communicating with you

384
00:15:40,035 --> 00:15:41,535
through your boyfriend.

385
00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:44,705
This is a direct experience
with The Creator, yours truly.

386
00:15:45,907 --> 00:15:47,142
The sooner you wrap
your head around it

387
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:49,210
the sooner we can get
to the matter at hand.

388
00:15:49,243 --> 00:15:51,745
The matter at hand?

389
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:53,546
You're in a
predicament, Gabrielle.

390
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,515
I'm here to help you out of it.

391
00:15:55,548 --> 00:15:56,816
Okay, do you have
any idea how much

392
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,352
you're creeping
me out right now?

393
00:15:58,386 --> 00:16:00,487
I do, but I need you to
give into the experience.

394
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,289
We don't have much time.

395
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:02,756
We have all weekend.

396
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:05,293
So how about you drop this now,

397
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:06,927
and if you still want
to play God tomorrow

398
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,095
we will revisit it?

399
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:09,297
I'm the only person
you'll ever meet

400
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,497
that isn't playing
God, actually.

401
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,966
Oh!

402
00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:14,800
What are you calling what
you're doing right now, then?

403
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:16,835
I am that I am.

404
00:16:16,869 --> 00:16:18,171
Okay.

405
00:16:18,204 --> 00:16:19,672
I am going to go
and take a shower

406
00:16:19,705 --> 00:16:22,242
and you are going to sit
down and have a drink.

407
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:24,443
When I get back, we
will watch a movie

408
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:27,147
and forget about whatever joke
you're trying to make here.

409
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,014
Look at me.

410
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,451
Does anything in me
seem like I'm joking?

411
00:16:32,484 --> 00:16:35,653
You are making me
seriously uncomfortable.

412
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:36,821
That's normal.

413
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:38,123
It gets worse before
it gets better

414
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:39,557
if you don't give in.

415
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,226
Holy shit, do you
actually genuinely believe

416
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,194
what you're saying?

417
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:43,162
Question is whether
or not you do.

418
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:44,562
I know who I am.

419
00:16:44,595 --> 00:16:45,930
You are actually crazy.

420
00:16:45,965 --> 00:16:47,166
[The Lord] You've been
with Michael for four months.

421
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,434
You know that he isn't crazy.

422
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,934
Yeah, well, I thought I did.

423
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:51,502
If you're not crazy, then
you're a fucking psychopath!

424
00:16:51,536 --> 00:16:53,105
You don't believe that.

425
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,139
Trust your instincts on this.

426
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:55,940
Michael's a good man.

427
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:57,542
Good men don't
pretend to be God!

428
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:58,743
Exactly.

429
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:00,211
Your heart knows Michael
isn't crazy or evil.

430
00:17:00,244 --> 00:17:02,512
Your mind just won't let
you accept the alternative.

431
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:03,814
Trust your heart on this one.

432
00:17:03,847 --> 00:17:05,083
It'll take you further.

433
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:07,018
Oh yeah, and throw
out all rationality?

434
00:17:07,051 --> 00:17:07,851
No, don't throw it out.

435
00:17:07,884 --> 00:17:09,287
Contextualize it.

436
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,356
Can you find love
with an equation?

437
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:13,458
Can you cure cancer
with friendship?

438
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,126
This is a matter for your heart.

439
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,060
Thanks.

440
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:17,295
I followed my heart to you

441
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,596
and it seems it led
me to manipulator.

442
00:17:19,629 --> 00:17:20,797
You don't believe that.

443
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,898
Not five minutes
ago you told Michael

444
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:23,133
you trusted him completely.

445
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,867
That was before you
pulled whatever the hell

446
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,336
this stunt is!

447
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,871
Or it was before you
had a reason to doubt him.

448
00:17:28,904 --> 00:17:31,074
Is trust only in the absence
of doubt ever really trust?

449
00:17:31,108 --> 00:17:32,309
This isn't doubt!

450
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,743
You are actively
breaking my trust!

451
00:17:33,776 --> 00:17:35,012
You're free to
make that judgment.

452
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:36,512
I'm still going to give
you the information.

453
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:37,847
The choice of what to do
with it is yours alone.

454
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,016
Excuse me.

455
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:40,783
I am officially calling it.

456
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:44,054
Both this game you're
playing and the two of us.

457
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:47,622
It's happening, and it
is happening for a reason.

458
00:17:50,493 --> 00:17:51,460
You're in danger.

459
00:17:51,494 --> 00:17:53,329
You're threatening me?

460
00:17:53,362 --> 00:17:54,363
I'm alerting you.

461
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:57,266
You're going to die before
the end of this weekend.

462
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,101
And you are not prepared.

463
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:04,539
[light eerie piano music]

464
00:18:04,572 --> 00:18:07,076
You know, you can't do this.

465
00:18:18,552 --> 00:18:20,422
Listen to me very carefully.

466
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:22,357
After death, there
comes a judgment.

467
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,892
There's a real heaven
and a real hell.

468
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:26,827
They're both everlasting.

469
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,761
I've given you this life

470
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:29,830
and on Sunday, it will finish.

471
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:35,235
If you die, as you are now,
it's hell that awaits you.

472
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:36,669
I will not be denying
your soul heaven.

473
00:18:36,702 --> 00:18:38,238
By rejecting me in this life,

474
00:18:38,272 --> 00:18:40,107
you have denied me your soul.

475
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:42,942
Having given you a free will

476
00:18:42,976 --> 00:18:44,211
I will respect the
choice you make with it,

477
00:18:44,244 --> 00:18:47,114
but I don't want that
fate for you, Gabrielle.

478
00:18:47,147 --> 00:18:48,614
I love you.

479
00:18:48,648 --> 00:18:49,916
I created you.

480
00:18:51,651 --> 00:18:52,852
When this life is complete,

481
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:54,254
it's my wish for
you to come home.

482
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:56,490
Great.

483
00:18:57,991 --> 00:18:59,292
Are you done?

484
00:18:59,325 --> 00:19:01,194
[The Lord] Mhmm.

485
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,262
Or do I need to
tell you another time

486
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:04,763
that I am not interested

487
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:06,832
in whatever it is
you're doing here?

488
00:19:08,034 --> 00:19:09,435
[The Lord] That's
the problem though.

489
00:19:09,469 --> 00:19:11,104
See your lack of interest
doesn't change your predicament.

490
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:12,371
We can have this
conversation now,

491
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:13,473
or we could have it
on the other side.

492
00:19:13,506 --> 00:19:14,706
Despite what that feels like,

493
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:15,975
it's much better if
we have it right now!

494
00:19:16,008 --> 00:19:17,176
What do you want
from me with this?

495
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,511
[The Lord] I don't
want anything from you.

496
00:19:18,544 --> 00:19:19,445
I want you.

497
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:21,414
I want us to have each other.

498
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:24,782
Is this your MO, dude?

499
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:26,917
You woo girls and then
bring them up to your cabin

500
00:19:26,951 --> 00:19:28,786
to kill them unless
they worship you?

501
00:19:30,455 --> 00:19:31,490
Oh my god, you're
actually gonna fucking

502
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:32,923
kill me, aren't you?

503
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,126
You would rather believe
that your boyfriend

504
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:35,759
has spontaneously
become a serial killer

505
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:37,028
than accept that your
creator loves you

506
00:19:37,062 --> 00:19:38,597
and has come to plead
with you to come home?

507
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:40,532
Only one of those things has
anything to do with reality!

508
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:41,466
How do you know?

509
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,800
Because I live in the world.

510
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,102
I see a lot of fucked up people,

511
00:19:44,136 --> 00:19:45,504
not so much the other thing.

512
00:19:45,537 --> 00:19:47,138
There's a great very
much that isn't seen

513
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:48,139
and is still true.

514
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:48,973
Maybe.

515
00:19:49,006 --> 00:19:50,174
But this is a joke.

516
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:51,308
You are trying to get me to buy

517
00:19:51,342 --> 00:19:52,576
into something
literally impossible.

518
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:53,511
No.

519
00:19:53,544 --> 00:19:54,512
I'm asking you to recategorize

520
00:19:54,545 --> 00:19:56,013
what you hold to be impossible.

521
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:57,281
Well that's impossible.

522
00:19:58,382 --> 00:20:00,117
You have two choices.

523
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:01,585
You can either trust
in Michael's character

524
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:03,053
and understand that
this is within the power

525
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:04,355
of a sovereign God

526
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:06,856
and come home to me Sunday,

527
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:09,593
or dismiss the present situation

528
00:20:09,627 --> 00:20:11,261
because you're
uncomfortable or skeptical

529
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,529
and spend the next
two days believing

530
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:15,632
that what I've
said is impossible.

531
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:17,933
Only to find out that this

532
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,638
was your last lifeline
from the darkness.

533
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,706
You will plead with me.

534
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:28,844
You will tell me you
couldn't have known.

535
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,315
You will bargain and
apologize and weep.

536
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:37,352
And it will break my heart to
tell you that it was too late.

537
00:20:38,753 --> 00:20:40,956
Yeah, well, what's breaking
my heart is finding out

538
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,325
that you're not who
I thought you were.

539
00:20:43,358 --> 00:20:44,626
I loved you, man.

540
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:47,496
This is love.

541
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:51,667
This, this is love.

542
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,936
Sooner or later you'll
understand that.

543
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:58,440
I want my fucking
boyfriend back.

544
00:21:06,913 --> 00:21:07,881
Hey.

545
00:21:07,914 --> 00:21:08,950
Hey, what's wrong?

546
00:21:08,983 --> 00:21:10,051
Whoah, whoa.

547
00:21:10,084 --> 00:21:11,018
I'm sorry if that
got a little intense.

548
00:21:11,052 --> 00:21:11,851
Intense?

549
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:13,020
You're an insane person.

550
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:14,488
I think that's a little harsh.

551
00:21:14,522 --> 00:21:16,123
I just thought that would
be romantic, honestly.

552
00:21:16,157 --> 00:21:18,392
I wanted to have,
you know, a moment.

553
00:21:18,426 --> 00:21:19,527
Well then with
your next girlfriend

554
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,727
maybe don't ruin the moment

555
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,662
by telling her
she's going to die

556
00:21:21,696 --> 00:21:22,496
unless she fucking worships you!

557
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,430
Next girlfriend?

558
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:24,431
What are you talking about?

559
00:21:24,464 --> 00:21:25,999
I am not going to be a
part of this mind game.

560
00:21:26,032 --> 00:21:27,000
It's that simple.

561
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:28,468
I hope you had your little fun

562
00:21:28,501 --> 00:21:29,868
and that it was worth
ruining a good thing for.

563
00:21:29,902 --> 00:21:31,104
A really good thing, Michael!

564
00:21:31,137 --> 00:21:32,572
I didn't mean
to ruin anything!

565
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:34,740
[Gabby] Well, at least you're
responding to Michael again.

566
00:21:34,773 --> 00:21:36,443
Of course I am?

567
00:21:37,876 --> 00:21:40,080
I guess I went a little too
far trying to create some

568
00:21:40,113 --> 00:21:41,681
I don't know, intimacy?

569
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:44,817
It was just misplaced affection.

570
00:21:46,486 --> 00:21:47,852
Is that what you call it?

571
00:21:47,885 --> 00:21:49,221
Misplaced affection?

572
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:50,489
Because from over here,

573
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:51,856
telling me that
I'm going to hell

574
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:54,226
is about as far from
affectionate as it fucking gets!

575
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:58,930
I have no idea where
this is coming from.

576
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:00,132
I see.

577
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:01,467
God is gone,

578
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,135
and Michael doesn't
remember anything

579
00:22:03,168 --> 00:22:04,069
from when God has here.

580
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:05,638
Am I basically getting it?

581
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:08,906
If you get what's going on,
that makes exactly one of us.

582
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,109
You said that you're God,

583
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:12,610
that I'm going to die on Sunday.

584
00:22:12,644 --> 00:22:14,979
You told me that I'm going
to hell two minutes ago!

585
00:22:15,013 --> 00:22:16,114
No, I don't,

586
00:22:16,147 --> 00:22:17,382
- I didn't-
- You didn't what?

587
00:22:17,415 --> 00:22:18,650
Say it?

588
00:22:18,683 --> 00:22:19,951
You just spent the
last five minutes-

589
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:20,817
- I believe you.

590
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,088
If that's what you say
happened, that's what happened.

591
00:22:24,122 --> 00:22:26,157
I must have blacked
out or something.

592
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,692
I don't know why I would
have said any of that.

593
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:30,094
I'm not buying the aw
shucks routine here, man.

594
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:31,396
You're taking me
home in the morning.

595
00:22:31,429 --> 00:22:32,829
Of course I will, but
you have to believe me.

596
00:22:32,863 --> 00:22:34,965
I don't remember anything
that you're saying.

597
00:22:34,998 --> 00:22:37,034
Okay, well then
you're mentally ill.

598
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:39,935
Pot doesn't make people
think that they're God.

599
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,171
You're right.

600
00:22:41,204 --> 00:22:43,340
Yeah, something to be
wrong with me then.

601
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:45,642
I'm so, so sorry.

602
00:22:46,777 --> 00:22:48,011
I'll take you home tomorrow

603
00:22:48,045 --> 00:22:49,579
- and I'll go see a doctor.
- Do what you have to do.

604
00:22:49,613 --> 00:22:50,813
I just don't want
to be a part of it.

605
00:22:52,482 --> 00:22:55,818
[Michael] Intentional or
not, it's my fault, my issue.

606
00:22:58,288 --> 00:23:00,189
You don't deserve to
be swept up in it.

607
00:23:02,658 --> 00:23:04,427
[Gabby] Do you think
having another drink

608
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,096
would calm your nerves
or make things worse?

609
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:07,963
Michael?

610
00:23:09,732 --> 00:23:11,200
He's a good man.

611
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:12,668
Saddle him with this and he
will carry the guilt with him

612
00:23:12,702 --> 00:23:13,969
for the rest of his life.

613
00:23:14,003 --> 00:23:15,738
He'll be in and out of
psychiatrist offices.

614
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:17,273
He'll fear having a
drink with friends,

615
00:23:17,306 --> 00:23:19,108
worried that he could slip
back into this God persona

616
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:20,543
and threaten them.

617
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:23,345
He will forever pair truly
opening up to and loving someone

618
00:23:23,378 --> 00:23:25,580
with this episode.

619
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,215
It will keep him from
ever trusting himself

620
00:23:27,248 --> 00:23:29,250
with falling in love
with another woman.

621
00:23:30,985 --> 00:23:32,020
From getting married,

622
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:34,189
from having children.

623
00:23:35,523 --> 00:23:37,058
Is that what you want for him?

624
00:23:37,092 --> 00:23:38,560
Michael?

625
00:23:38,593 --> 00:23:39,794
You're having another episode,
are you in there somewhere?

626
00:23:39,828 --> 00:23:40,729
Michael doesn't
know I'm doing this.

627
00:23:40,762 --> 00:23:42,530
I need you to believe.

628
00:23:42,564 --> 00:23:43,798
Not just for your own sake,

629
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:44,999
but because I need
you to be the one

630
00:23:45,033 --> 00:23:46,368
to convince Michael
that I was here.

631
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:47,568
But you aren't here.

632
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:48,969
You are a hiccup
in Michael's brain.

633
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:50,204
That's easier to
accept, isn't it?

634
00:23:50,237 --> 00:23:52,039
If that's what you
insist is happening

635
00:23:52,072 --> 00:23:54,341
you don't have to
adjust your reality.

636
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,578
You wouldn't have to face
the creator you've rejected.

637
00:23:57,611 --> 00:23:59,613
You wouldn't be dying on Sunday.

638
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,115
Look, I understand
the appeal of denial,

639
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,983
don't get me wrong, but

640
00:24:03,016 --> 00:24:05,152
all it's really doing is
making the final moments

641
00:24:05,185 --> 00:24:07,488
of your walk into
damnation more comfortable.

642
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:09,022
This feels very real
for you, doesn't it?

643
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:11,057
You genuinely think you're God.

644
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,025
Ah, you won't even
consider the alternative.

645
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:15,461
Yes, this could be
a mental illness,

646
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,798
or it could be exactly
what I'm telling you it is.

647
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:20,233
No, it really couldn't.

648
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:21,667
Why not?

649
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:23,870
Why couldn't God do exactly
this if he wanted to?

650
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:25,772
Okay, I'm not saying
that a theoretical God

651
00:24:25,805 --> 00:24:27,939
couldn't do this hypothetically.

652
00:24:27,974 --> 00:24:29,142
[The Lord] You're
just saying he isn't.

653
00:24:29,175 --> 00:24:30,376
Exactly.

654
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,711
And you know what
God's been up to, to you?

655
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,413
You've been keeping tabs on him?

656
00:24:33,446 --> 00:24:35,814
I don't even
believe in God, dude.

657
00:24:35,847 --> 00:24:37,382
All the more reason he
would need to come to you

658
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:39,751
in the days before your death.

659
00:24:39,785 --> 00:24:43,121
And how would he do
that if he doesn't exist?

660
00:24:43,155 --> 00:24:44,790
And you know he doesn't exist?

661
00:24:44,823 --> 00:24:46,224
How?

662
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:48,093
How have you managed to
determine with such certainty

663
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:49,927
that a being entirely separate

664
00:24:49,961 --> 00:24:53,532
from your sphere of
perception doesn't exist?

665
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:56,535
Did you manage to check outside
your reality from inside

666
00:24:56,568 --> 00:24:58,702
and determine that
I'm not there?

667
00:24:58,736 --> 00:24:59,703
How are you so sure?

668
00:24:59,737 --> 00:25:01,472
Because it's ridiculous.

669
00:25:01,505 --> 00:25:02,339
Mmmm.

670
00:25:03,774 --> 00:25:05,509
If not being ridiculous were
a prerequisite for truth,

671
00:25:05,543 --> 00:25:07,578
nobody would believe
in the platypus.

672
00:25:07,611 --> 00:25:10,414
Okay, well, if I could
only know a platypus existed

673
00:25:10,448 --> 00:25:12,550
by speaking to him
through my boyfriend,

674
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,819
I would probably
be skeptical, yeah.

675
00:25:14,852 --> 00:25:17,121
You know what I think?

676
00:25:17,154 --> 00:25:18,556
I think you reject me

677
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,692
not because you've
scoured through infinity

678
00:25:21,725 --> 00:25:23,092
and determined my absence,

679
00:25:23,126 --> 00:25:26,129
or because I'm some
impossible concept,

680
00:25:26,162 --> 00:25:27,664
but because you don't like me.

681
00:25:29,532 --> 00:25:30,767
You don't want me to
exist because it puts

682
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,968
an authority over you

683
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:32,936
and you don't want to
be held accountable

684
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:34,304
for what you do in this life.

685
00:25:35,472 --> 00:25:36,372
That's not true.

686
00:25:37,507 --> 00:25:38,741
Well, you don't
believe in the person

687
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:40,276
standing in front of you,

688
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,878
so forgive me if I don't take
you as an authority on truth.

689
00:25:41,911 --> 00:25:44,013
I know what's true about me.

690
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:45,748
You know what
feels true to you.

691
00:25:46,915 --> 00:25:48,150
Okay, yeah, well,
when we're talking

692
00:25:48,183 --> 00:25:50,385
about what I believe,
that's the same thing.

693
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:51,620
Great.

694
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:52,888
Then by your logic,

695
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:54,356
if this is a hiccup
of Michael's brain,

696
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:55,557
but it feels true to him,

697
00:25:55,591 --> 00:25:56,758
that makes it true?

698
00:25:56,792 --> 00:25:58,393
God is simultaneously
here and not here.

699
00:25:58,427 --> 00:26:00,128
He exists and he doesn't.

700
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:01,330
What a world!

701
00:26:01,363 --> 00:26:03,432
[Gabby] Obviously
that doesn't make sense.

702
00:26:03,465 --> 00:26:06,401
But it's possible,
according to your standards.

703
00:26:06,435 --> 00:26:07,736
So what does that tell you?

704
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:09,037
You know, be as
clever as you want.

705
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:10,805
This doesn't change
the fact that this

706
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:12,507
isn't something that
can happen in real life.

707
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,875
The fact?

708
00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:15,610
You better be sure that
that's absolutely true

709
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:17,778
before you go gambling
your eternity on it.

710
00:26:17,812 --> 00:26:19,580
Well, you're
rigging the game, man.

711
00:26:19,614 --> 00:26:21,048
There are no absolute truths.

712
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:25,019
Oh, okay.

713
00:26:25,052 --> 00:26:26,387
Wait, is it absolutely true

714
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,756
that there are no
absolute truths?

715
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:29,857
I guess not.

716
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:31,659
Then you could be wrong.

717
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:33,361
There could be absolute truths.

718
00:26:33,394 --> 00:26:35,161
[Gabby] Sure,
I could be wrong.

719
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:38,231
So you admit you don't know
as much as you're insisting?

720
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:40,467
Yeah, maybe I don't,
but neither do you.

721
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,668
[The Lord] God
could know what was

722
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:43,236
absolutely true
though, couldn't he?

723
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,539
Yeah, hypothetically,
but you aren't God.

724
00:26:45,572 --> 00:26:47,040
You already said that
if there was a God,

725
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:48,208
he could do this.

726
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:49,977
So why are you
still so closed off?

727
00:26:51,244 --> 00:26:53,914
If I had to wager a
guess, which I don't,

728
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:57,884
I'd say it's because it
focuses a spotlight on you.

729
00:26:57,918 --> 00:26:59,151
You want Michael to be crazy

730
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:00,753
because then he's
the problem here.

731
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,390
Are you avoiding this
because you know that

732
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:06,725
a moral and just judgment
of your entire life

733
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:07,660
would condemn you?

734
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,430
Are you shuddering from
looking into the face

735
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,300
of your mortality
because somewhere in you,

736
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,302
you know you deserve
to go to hell?

737
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,170
You know what, now that
I'm thinking about it,

738
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:20,172
I remember hearing that
indulging someone's delusions

739
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,407
only makes them worse.

740
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,975
So I'm not gonna engage
with you any further.

741
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,075
[The Lord] As
long as you can fit

742
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:25,276
whatever's happening here

743
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,511
into your mental
schema of psychosis

744
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,246
you will continue
to push me out.

745
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,181
You see how that's a problem?

746
00:27:30,214 --> 00:27:33,117
As long as God isn't the
only possibility for you,

747
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,787
you choose the alternative.

748
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,422
It doesn't matter if that
means turning the image

749
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:41,092
of the man you love into a
mental patient or a manipulator.

750
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:44,095
It's better anything else than
it is truly being me, right?

751
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:47,431
Okay, God.

752
00:27:47,464 --> 00:27:49,733
I hear you, you're
upset with me.

753
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:51,301
You want to talk to me about it.

754
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:53,503
Why don't we have that
conversation tomorrow, okay?

755
00:27:53,537 --> 00:27:55,539
Let's all go to bed,
get a good night's rest.

756
00:27:55,572 --> 00:27:57,841
And we will talk all about
heaven when we wake up.

757
00:27:57,874 --> 00:27:59,043
[The Lord] You're never
going to want to have

758
00:27:59,077 --> 00:28:00,544
this conversation, Gabrielle.

759
00:28:00,577 --> 00:28:01,745
You're always going to
want to push it away

760
00:28:01,778 --> 00:28:03,014
either by some hollow reason

761
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:04,581
for disbelief or
procrastination.

762
00:28:04,615 --> 00:28:08,585
You will never want that
intimidating moment to be now.

763
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:10,054
I've told you, truthfully

764
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,489
that on Sunday at your judgment,
we will go through it all.

765
00:28:14,657 --> 00:28:16,225
You're going to wish
you'd done it now.

766
00:28:16,258 --> 00:28:19,562
I understand what
you're saying, my Lord,

767
00:28:19,595 --> 00:28:21,897
but it has been an
exhausting day of driving

768
00:28:21,932 --> 00:28:24,067
and I'm still not exactly sober.

769
00:28:24,101 --> 00:28:25,534
So I think it would be best

770
00:28:25,568 --> 00:28:27,470
for both of us to revisit
this when I've rested.

771
00:28:27,503 --> 00:28:28,704
[The Lord] Even if I
couldn't see your heart,

772
00:28:28,738 --> 00:28:30,941
your tone wouldn't
fool a toddler,

773
00:28:30,974 --> 00:28:32,908
let alone your creator.

774
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:34,210
You can see my heart?

775
00:28:34,243 --> 00:28:35,443
Yes.

776
00:28:35,477 --> 00:28:37,980
I know your intentions
better than you do.

777
00:28:38,014 --> 00:28:39,180
Right.

778
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:41,182
Being God and all.

779
00:28:41,216 --> 00:28:42,384
[The Lord] Naturally.

780
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:46,254
Well, that raises some
obvious questions, doesn't it?

781
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:47,322
[The Lord] I'd hope so.

782
00:28:47,355 --> 00:28:48,456
I've been waiting for
you to get on board

783
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,290
so you can ask them.

784
00:28:49,324 --> 00:28:51,593
No, I'm not getting onboard.

785
00:28:51,626 --> 00:28:54,195
A real God wouldn't do this.

786
00:28:54,229 --> 00:28:56,598
A real God would appear as a

787
00:28:56,631 --> 00:28:59,400
floating talking
eyeball, or whatever.

788
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:01,102
That'd be much more convincing.

789
00:29:01,136 --> 00:29:04,238
Or hell, turn my
glass into a frog.

790
00:29:04,271 --> 00:29:05,940
Then you've got me as
your captive audience.

791
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:08,242
All ears, promise.

792
00:29:08,275 --> 00:29:09,743
[The Lord] That
isn't that easy though.

793
00:29:09,777 --> 00:29:11,679
Right, why would it be?

794
00:29:11,712 --> 00:29:14,548
It would be an awful shame to
offer any proof, I suppose.

795
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:15,783
In a way, yes.

796
00:29:16,784 --> 00:29:18,053
[scoffing] Okay, come on.

797
00:29:18,086 --> 00:29:19,653
You want me to believe
your God, yeah?

798
00:29:19,687 --> 00:29:21,622
That's why you're here?

799
00:29:21,655 --> 00:29:22,455
Mhmm.

800
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:23,289
Okay.

801
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:24,958
So go on then.

802
00:29:26,325 --> 00:29:29,029
Speak to me in a big,
booming voice from the sky.

803
00:29:29,063 --> 00:29:32,598
If you can do that,
then sure, you're God.

804
00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:34,701
If not, then maybe it's you

805
00:29:34,734 --> 00:29:37,670
who needs to come to terms
with an uncomfortable truth.

806
00:29:37,704 --> 00:29:39,439
That you aren't God,

807
00:29:39,472 --> 00:29:41,674
you're a product
of Michael's brain.

808
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:44,510
I'm the creator of the
cosmos and all inside of it,

809
00:29:44,544 --> 00:29:46,212
not a part of it.

810
00:29:46,245 --> 00:29:48,081
I'm not merely beyond
your physical universe

811
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:50,682
but in another realm
of existence entirely.

812
00:29:51,883 --> 00:29:54,087
My true essence has
no translation here.

813
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,587
No comprehensible form.

814
00:29:57,789 --> 00:29:59,257
I can only interact
with your world

815
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:01,827
by my pressing up against the
boundaries of your reality.

816
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,497
You have to be the one to
sense me on the other side.

817
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:08,433
If I shout at you,

818
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:09,701
you wouldn't hear me any more

819
00:30:09,735 --> 00:30:10,936
than the characters on
your television screen

820
00:30:10,969 --> 00:30:13,571
could hear you hollering
up against the glass.

821
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:17,408
I speak through your world,
not into it, every day.

822
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,178
And to every single one of you.

823
00:30:20,212 --> 00:30:23,547
I'm not Charlton Heston
booming down from the sky.

824
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,650
I'm your intuition.

825
00:30:26,684 --> 00:30:29,221
I'm the overheard
conversations of strangers,

826
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:30,554
sudden sparks of insight.

827
00:30:31,922 --> 00:30:35,059
Have you ever had a particularly
meaningful fortune cookie?

828
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,163
Nearly everything
that you experienced

829
00:30:39,196 --> 00:30:41,564
is my half of a lifelong
ongoing conversation

830
00:30:41,598 --> 00:30:43,134
between the two of us.

831
00:30:43,167 --> 00:30:46,103
And right now, because of the
urgency of your circumstances

832
00:30:46,137 --> 00:30:48,072
I've come to you this way.

833
00:30:48,105 --> 00:30:52,243
As directly and obviously
as our distance allows.

834
00:30:54,945 --> 00:30:55,745
It's good, man.

835
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,313
It's good.

836
00:30:58,347 --> 00:31:00,950
It's a little convenient
though, isn't it?

837
00:31:02,085 --> 00:31:03,285
Your hands are tied
from doing the one thing

838
00:31:03,318 --> 00:31:04,653
that would prove your story?

839
00:31:04,686 --> 00:31:06,522
Can a video game programmer
jump into a software

840
00:31:06,555 --> 00:31:08,624
and introduced himself
to his characters?

841
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:11,194
Can he walk around
moving the ones and zeros

842
00:31:11,227 --> 00:31:12,694
with his bare hands?

843
00:31:12,728 --> 00:31:15,564
Or must he change the code
from his dwelling space

844
00:31:15,597 --> 00:31:17,666
outside of the hardware?

845
00:31:17,699 --> 00:31:20,003
That doesn't mean the
programmer doesn't exist.

846
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:21,804
It just means that he doesn't
interact with the data

847
00:31:21,837 --> 00:31:24,173
the same way that he
does the physical world.

848
00:31:24,206 --> 00:31:25,606
And I don't interact
with the physical world

849
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,210
the same way that
I do the spiritual.

850
00:31:28,243 --> 00:31:30,112
So change the code then.

851
00:31:30,145 --> 00:31:32,014
Delete the couch from
this living room.

852
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:34,715
I don't operate in the
way you're asking me to.

853
00:31:34,749 --> 00:31:36,484
But that doesn't mean
that I do nothing.

854
00:31:36,517 --> 00:31:38,519
I'm constantly at
work in this world.

855
00:31:38,553 --> 00:31:39,988
My arms are chance
and happenstance.

856
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:41,990
My voice is synchronicity.

857
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,559
But as I work
within natural laws,

858
00:31:44,592 --> 00:31:48,162
you can dismiss everything
that I do here as a coincidence

859
00:31:48,196 --> 00:31:49,896
or a natural phenomenon or,

860
00:31:50,797 --> 00:31:53,301
in this case, mental illness.

861
00:31:54,801 --> 00:31:59,273
Yeah, well, if you are God,

862
00:31:59,307 --> 00:32:01,108
you would know how
this looks to me.

863
00:32:01,142 --> 00:32:02,909
I know exactly
what you're feeling.

864
00:32:03,945 --> 00:32:05,478
You're lying to yourself.

865
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:07,014
I think I know my own mind.

866
00:32:07,048 --> 00:32:08,715
You can know your own mind
when it's convenient for you

867
00:32:08,748 --> 00:32:10,683
but Michael's lost
his when it isn't?

868
00:32:10,716 --> 00:32:13,619
The truth here is that
you have no knowledge

869
00:32:13,652 --> 00:32:15,155
and two choices.

870
00:32:15,188 --> 00:32:16,889
If you were in a situation
with a mentally ill person

871
00:32:16,923 --> 00:32:20,227
it could look like
this, sure, but,

872
00:32:22,062 --> 00:32:23,529
if what I've told you is true

873
00:32:24,496 --> 00:32:26,398
and the sovereign and living God

874
00:32:26,432 --> 00:32:28,801
has given you a
personal audience,

875
00:32:30,003 --> 00:32:32,371
it too would look
exactly like this.

876
00:32:32,404 --> 00:32:36,141
From the limits of your
perspective, both options are valid.

877
00:32:36,175 --> 00:32:39,510
Yet you choose categorically
that one is true,

878
00:32:39,544 --> 00:32:42,114
and the other impossible.

879
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:44,749
As much as you want to believe

880
00:32:44,782 --> 00:32:45,985
you're doing the
rational thing here,

881
00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:47,852
you're not making an
intellectual decision.

882
00:32:47,886 --> 00:32:50,089
The question here
is whether or not

883
00:32:50,122 --> 00:32:52,757
you have trust or doubt.

884
00:32:53,658 --> 00:32:54,927
And you're choosing doubt.

885
00:32:56,128 --> 00:32:58,229
I'm urging you to reconsider.

886
00:32:58,263 --> 00:32:59,863
You're letting the wrong
things cloud your judgment.

887
00:32:59,897 --> 00:33:01,832
And it has put your
eternity in jeopardy.

888
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:04,002
[Gabby] You can make
anything sound reasonable

889
00:33:04,035 --> 00:33:05,236
as a hypothetical.

890
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,403
Then maybe it's
just reasonable.

891
00:33:06,436 --> 00:33:07,504
You can dress it
up nice and pretty.

892
00:33:07,537 --> 00:33:09,173
But at the end of the day,

893
00:33:09,207 --> 00:33:10,942
people don't claim to be
God because they are God.

894
00:33:10,975 --> 00:33:13,044
They claim to be God,
because they're unwell.

895
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:15,113
Do you have a reason
to separate reality

896
00:33:15,146 --> 00:33:17,414
from a reasonable
hypothetical about reality?

897
00:33:18,782 --> 00:33:21,252
Is your problem with
the idea of God,

898
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:24,021
or do you just not want me
here in your living room?

899
00:33:24,054 --> 00:33:25,554
It doesn't matter what I want.

900
00:33:25,588 --> 00:33:27,890
This feels like a full fledged
assault on common sense.

901
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:28,758
Feels like.

902
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:31,161
Does how you feel
about something

903
00:33:31,194 --> 00:33:32,062
influence whether
or not it's real?

904
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:33,496
No.

905
00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:36,066
But in this case it's just
plainly and obviously not true.

906
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:37,000
Hmm.

907
00:33:37,034 --> 00:33:38,368
And that is absolutely true.

908
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:40,770
Yes.

909
00:33:42,239 --> 00:33:44,374
Didn't you say earlier that
there were no absolute truths?

910
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:47,442
Well I think
it's true at least.

911
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:49,711
You think so, but
you can't know so.

912
00:33:49,744 --> 00:33:51,813
So why assert that
your belief is reality?

913
00:33:51,846 --> 00:33:54,582
All I know is my
own truth, okay?

914
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,218
I've managed to figure
out what seems true,

915
00:33:56,252 --> 00:33:58,955
what seems moral and
immoral, and I live by that.

916
00:33:58,988 --> 00:34:00,889
[The Lord] So you've
made yourself God?

917
00:34:00,923 --> 00:34:02,557
And what if I have?

918
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,961
Why shouldn't I create
the rules for my own life?

919
00:34:04,994 --> 00:34:06,295
Are you qualified?

920
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:07,529
You already said you
don't know what's true

921
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:08,397
and what's not.

922
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:11,333
What if you're wrong?

923
00:34:11,366 --> 00:34:13,134
I know how to treat
people with kindness

924
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:14,135
and with love.

925
00:34:15,502 --> 00:34:16,770
And could you give love
if I didn't create you

926
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:17,973
to be loving?

927
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:19,207
Would you even
know what love was

928
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,642
if I hadn't invented
it in the first place?

929
00:34:21,675 --> 00:34:23,378
You're borrowing from me.

930
00:34:23,411 --> 00:34:24,878
How are you a better
judge of morality

931
00:34:24,912 --> 00:34:26,448
than the one who invented good?

932
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,983
I'm trying as hard as I can.

933
00:34:28,016 --> 00:34:30,285
And I'm telling you, you
don't have to try so hard.

934
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,989
Not being God isn't
denying you privileges.

935
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:35,822
It's a kindness.

936
00:34:35,855 --> 00:34:38,292
Defining reality,
discerning absolutes,

937
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:41,527
these aren't your
burdens to carry.

938
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,931
Your role is to enjoy them.

939
00:34:45,732 --> 00:34:49,203
I don't know how I would
even begin to accept that.

940
00:34:49,236 --> 00:34:50,703
You start by admitting

941
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:53,374
you don't know that what
I've told you isn't true.

942
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:55,275
Because I can promise
you, you don't.

943
00:34:56,509 --> 00:34:58,311
The world is a
far stranger place

944
00:34:58,344 --> 00:34:59,979
than you're giving
it credit for.

945
00:35:01,481 --> 00:35:02,681
Uncertainty is good,

946
00:35:03,782 --> 00:35:05,451
but admission of
uncertainty is better.

947
00:35:05,485 --> 00:35:06,618
I can work with that.

948
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:10,756
You're not going to have the
answers you want about this

949
00:35:10,789 --> 00:35:12,058
in this life.

950
00:35:12,091 --> 00:35:13,226
The only way you can
know these things

951
00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:14,693
is if I tell them to you.

952
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:16,795
So trust what's being
revealed to you right now.

953
00:35:18,231 --> 00:35:19,132
I can't do that.

954
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:24,469
[The Lord] And you'll
feel that way tomorrow too.

955
00:35:24,503 --> 00:35:25,404
I'm sure I will.

956
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:29,307
Well, as I've said,

957
00:35:29,341 --> 00:35:30,942
you're free to make that choice.

958
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,812
It's just much easier if
we talk about this now

959
00:35:34,845 --> 00:35:36,614
than on judgment day.

960
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:39,384
I can't let you walk
obliviously into the fire.

961
00:35:40,551 --> 00:35:42,653
But if you do so with
your eyes wide open,

962
00:35:44,156 --> 00:35:45,390
I will respect the
choice you make

963
00:35:45,424 --> 00:35:47,024
with the free will
that I gave you.

964
00:35:47,058 --> 00:35:49,994
I don't feel like I have
my eyes wide open at all.

965
00:35:50,027 --> 00:35:52,163
I'm stumbling around
blind if anything!

966
00:35:52,196 --> 00:35:54,331
And here I am telling
you that I see clearly

967
00:35:54,365 --> 00:35:55,632
and to follow my voice.

968
00:35:55,665 --> 00:35:56,967
Well how do I know
that you can actually see

969
00:35:57,001 --> 00:35:58,436
if you don't prove it?

970
00:35:58,469 --> 00:36:00,904
You can't, you
have to trust me.

971
00:36:00,938 --> 00:36:04,141
You've run from me your
whole life and I've let you

972
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:06,143
because there was
always tomorrow.

973
00:36:06,177 --> 00:36:07,978
and tomorrow you
could come back.

974
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:10,480
But now?

975
00:36:12,148 --> 00:36:14,984
Now there's precisely
one more tomorrow.

976
00:36:15,018 --> 00:36:16,419
That's it.

977
00:36:16,453 --> 00:36:19,688
And I really, really
don't want to lose you.

978
00:36:29,499 --> 00:36:30,333
Michael?

979
00:36:33,836 --> 00:36:34,669
Michael.

980
00:36:38,173 --> 00:36:39,007
God?

981
00:36:40,808 --> 00:36:43,811
[light piano music]

982
00:36:59,127 --> 00:36:59,961
[keys jingling]

983
00:37:20,948 --> 00:37:21,781
Wake up.

984
00:37:23,016 --> 00:37:25,085
Wake up, you piece of shit!

985
00:37:26,852 --> 00:37:28,654
What the fuck?!

986
00:37:28,687 --> 00:37:29,923
What is this, huh?

987
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,657
Are you gonna kill me?

988
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,726
Are you gonna fucking kill me?

989
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:34,693
What the hell, you
didn't even finish

990
00:37:34,727 --> 00:37:36,129
a fucking drink!

991
00:37:37,497 --> 00:37:38,331
Fuck!

992
00:37:49,774 --> 00:37:53,279
[light tense piano music]

993
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,055
I am going crazy.

994
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:07,426
I am going crazy!

995
00:38:09,628 --> 00:38:12,896
[tense dramatic music]

996
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:17,535
You better just be sick.

997
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:19,736
Or you better fucking be God!

998
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:27,811
[gloomy music]

999
00:38:30,048 --> 00:38:30,881
Asshole.

1000
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:45,329
I am going crazy

1001
00:38:45,362 --> 00:38:48,031
[door knocking]

1002
00:38:50,067 --> 00:38:50,900
[Michael] Hey.

1003
00:38:54,571 --> 00:38:55,472
Sorry.

1004
00:38:55,505 --> 00:38:56,739
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

1005
00:39:00,076 --> 00:39:00,875
How'd you sleep?

1006
00:39:02,245 --> 00:39:04,013
Not at all.

1007
00:39:04,046 --> 00:39:06,182
Mostly, then badly.

1008
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:10,752
[Michael] I guess I slept
on the couch last night?

1009
00:39:10,785 --> 00:39:12,255
Yeah, you passed out.

1010
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:15,790
I don't think I'm used to
drinking and smoking, you know?

1011
00:39:15,824 --> 00:39:17,560
That was something else.

1012
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:18,995
I've been around
enough people tripping

1013
00:39:19,028 --> 00:39:22,063
and I have never seen
anything like what you did.

1014
00:39:22,097 --> 00:39:23,565
Or anyone so unresponsive.

1015
00:39:23,598 --> 00:39:25,866
I literally thought you
could have died for a second.

1016
00:39:25,899 --> 00:39:28,303
Good news is I'm still alive.

1017
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:32,173
That's good news, right?

1018
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:33,908
Yeah, of course.

1019
00:39:33,942 --> 00:39:36,311
I know what happened last
night was really weird for you.

1020
00:39:36,344 --> 00:39:38,613
It was really weird for me too.

1021
00:39:38,647 --> 00:39:40,615
Hearing what you said,
I did whenever I was on,

1022
00:39:40,649 --> 00:39:43,685
I don't know on
autopilot or whatever,

1023
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:47,221
it must've been frightening.

1024
00:39:50,057 --> 00:39:52,092
I can't express to
you how sorry I am.

1025
00:39:52,126 --> 00:39:53,394
Well, you did it again.

1026
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:55,763
We were having a
normal conversation

1027
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:57,331
and you flipped
right back into it.

1028
00:39:58,465 --> 00:39:59,300
I did?

1029
00:40:01,302 --> 00:40:03,037
I promise I would never
do anything intentionally

1030
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,204
to scare you.

1031
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,107
I don't know if there's
anything I can say

1032
00:40:07,141 --> 00:40:08,509
to smooth this over or

1033
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:11,177
if this is just ruined
now because of me,

1034
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,878
but I want you to know

1035
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:16,449
that these past few months
have been wonderful.

1036
00:40:16,482 --> 00:40:18,151
I'm just really sorry

1037
00:40:19,285 --> 00:40:21,087
for screwing this up.

1038
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,522
So whatever we do from here,

1039
00:40:24,557 --> 00:40:27,327
I'm just grateful that I had
you in my life while I did.

1040
00:40:28,561 --> 00:40:32,598
Anyway, that's all
I had to say, so.

1041
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:35,667
I came up here to wake you up

1042
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:37,169
because it's a little past noon

1043
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:39,837
and I wanted to see if you still
wanted me to take you home.

1044
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,240
I think what I really want
right now is some privacy

1045
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:43,375
so I can take a shower.

1046
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:45,811
Okay?

1047
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:46,645
Yeah.

1048
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,914
Okay, sure.

1049
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,131
[intense music]

1050
00:41:28,618 --> 00:41:29,519
[Gabby] Michael?

1051
00:41:33,056 --> 00:41:34,290
Michael?

1052
00:41:34,324 --> 00:41:35,792
Sorry.

1053
00:41:35,825 --> 00:41:36,860
A million miles away.

1054
00:41:38,328 --> 00:41:39,763
You showered fast.

1055
00:41:39,796 --> 00:41:41,731
[Gabby] Listen, how
you treated me last night

1056
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:42,999
was beyond inappropriate.

1057
00:41:43,032 --> 00:41:43,967
I know, I know you're right.

1058
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,135
Please just let me say this.

1059
00:41:52,474 --> 00:41:55,244
I know that you're beating
yourself up over this.

1060
00:41:55,277 --> 00:41:57,980
And I think that's a good thing.

1061
00:41:59,148 --> 00:42:01,383
I mean, you told
me I was gonna die.

1062
00:42:01,417 --> 00:42:04,787
I legit thought that
you were gonna kill me.

1063
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,255
And I know you weren't
really in control

1064
00:42:06,288 --> 00:42:08,290
of what you're saying,
but that's not an excuse.

1065
00:42:08,323 --> 00:42:09,491
It came out of you.

1066
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:12,093
I saw a side of the
man I love last night

1067
00:42:12,126 --> 00:42:14,529
that I thought was
capable of hurting me.

1068
00:42:15,563 --> 00:42:16,631
I almost stole your
car and left you here,

1069
00:42:16,664 --> 00:42:17,565
I was so scared.

1070
00:42:17,598 --> 00:42:19,066
Oh my God, really?

1071
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,768
Yes, really.

1072
00:42:20,802 --> 00:42:22,804
I don't know, I couldn't.

1073
00:42:22,837 --> 00:42:23,671
Obviously.

1074
00:42:25,072 --> 00:42:26,307
If you really did have some
kind of psychotic break

1075
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,842
I couldn't just abandon you here

1076
00:42:27,875 --> 00:42:29,444
when the phones don't even work.

1077
00:42:29,477 --> 00:42:30,745
I wouldn't blame
you if you did.

1078
00:42:30,778 --> 00:42:32,947
Good, I would have
been totally justified.

1079
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,880
[Michael] You would have.

1080
00:42:33,915 --> 00:42:35,015
Totally in my rights.

1081
00:42:35,048 --> 00:42:36,149
I agree.

1082
00:42:36,183 --> 00:42:37,284
It's a lot for me
to take in too.

1083
00:42:37,317 --> 00:42:38,518
You have to take it in.

1084
00:42:38,552 --> 00:42:41,321
You have to know how
serious this was for me.

1085
00:42:41,354 --> 00:42:42,489
Trust me, I get it.

1086
00:42:42,522 --> 00:42:44,057
It's really serious for me too.

1087
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:46,593
Then that said,

1088
00:42:48,328 --> 00:42:50,397
if you know that, I
need you to promise me

1089
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,865
if anything like
this happens again,

1090
00:42:51,899 --> 00:42:54,902
you're gonna see like, a doctor.

1091
00:42:54,936 --> 00:42:56,136
Yeah, of course.

1092
00:42:56,169 --> 00:42:57,736
Of course, yeah.

1093
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,206
And I think we
should put a moratorium

1094
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:01,440
on getting stoned.

1095
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:04,243
Absolutely.

1096
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,947
All right then.

1097
00:43:08,147 --> 00:43:11,217
You're sorry and
we're in agreement.

1098
00:43:12,852 --> 00:43:13,686
So...

1099
00:43:15,922 --> 00:43:18,457
I don't think we
have to break up.

1100
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:21,927
I really do love you, dude.

1101
00:43:23,328 --> 00:43:25,965
And I'm still upset
about everything but

1102
00:43:27,432 --> 00:43:30,268
I'm sorry for saying some
of the things I said.

1103
00:43:30,301 --> 00:43:32,470
You don't have to apologize.

1104
00:43:33,872 --> 00:43:34,706
I deserve it.

1105
00:43:43,147 --> 00:43:43,949
I love you.

1106
00:43:49,319 --> 00:43:50,621
Let's just try
and put behind us

1107
00:43:50,654 --> 00:43:52,356
for the next couple
of days, yeah?

1108
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,424
Yeah.

1109
00:43:55,526 --> 00:43:56,693
Gladly.

1110
00:43:56,727 --> 00:43:58,228
[ball clacking]

1111
00:43:58,262 --> 00:43:59,998
Woo, game!

1112
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:00,797
Best two out of three?

1113
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:02,266
No, it's cool.

1114
00:44:02,299 --> 00:44:03,734
I'm fine with you just being
better at this one than me.

1115
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:05,168
Okay, okay, let's
play darts then.

1116
00:44:05,202 --> 00:44:06,470
Here, I'm lousy at those.

1117
00:44:10,506 --> 00:44:11,340
Here.

1118
00:44:18,347 --> 00:44:19,248
Okay.

1119
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:20,216
Hang on, let me show you.

1120
00:44:20,249 --> 00:44:21,083
Here.

1121
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:23,419
All right.

1122
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,287
Take that.

1123
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,822
All right, just keep your
eye on where you're aiming

1124
00:44:26,856 --> 00:44:27,790
and your brain will
fill in the rest.

1125
00:44:27,823 --> 00:44:29,026
- Okay?
- You know what?

1126
00:44:29,058 --> 00:44:30,693
I don't think I'm very
good at this one either.

1127
00:44:30,726 --> 00:44:32,562
Why don't we just take
it easy on the couch,

1128
00:44:32,595 --> 00:44:33,429
watch a movie?

1129
00:44:35,063 --> 00:44:36,131
Okay, yeah.

1130
00:44:40,235 --> 00:44:41,069
Hey, hey.

1131
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:45,774
I love you, you know?

1132
00:44:45,807 --> 00:44:46,641
I know.

1133
00:44:49,946 --> 00:44:51,179
I love you too.

1134
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:11,799
You know, I could
use a drink actually.

1135
00:45:11,832 --> 00:45:13,034
You want one?

1136
00:45:14,401 --> 00:45:15,202
Yeah.

1137
00:45:16,203 --> 00:45:17,438
Seven and seven?

1138
00:45:36,289 --> 00:45:39,225
[glasses clinking]

1139
00:45:52,939 --> 00:45:54,974
[Gabby sobbing]

1140
00:45:55,008 --> 00:45:57,376
[Man On TV] Extra
daylight does us.

1141
00:45:57,409 --> 00:45:59,378
Now we've still got a
three hour drive back.

1142
00:45:59,411 --> 00:46:01,446
We're not going to be
home until after midnight.

1143
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,781
[Woman On TV] Well if
it really bugs you, Johnny

1144
00:46:02,814 --> 00:46:04,083
you wouldn't do it.

1145
00:46:04,117 --> 00:46:05,350
[Johnny] You think
I wanna blow Sunday

1146
00:46:05,384 --> 00:46:07,053
on a scene like this?

1147
00:46:07,086 --> 00:46:08,854
[Man On TV] You know, I figure
we're either going to have

1148
00:46:08,887 --> 00:46:10,621
to move mother out
here or move to Grays.

1149
00:46:10,655 --> 00:46:11,856
I broke us, didn't I?

1150
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,357
[Woman On TV] He can't
make a trip like this.

1151
00:46:13,391 --> 00:46:14,225
No.

1152
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,827
I don't think so.

1153
00:46:18,429 --> 00:46:19,630
I don't know.

1154
00:46:19,664 --> 00:46:21,265
I just don't feel
quite right yet.

1155
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:24,635
That's okay, isn't it?

1156
00:46:24,669 --> 00:46:29,674
Yeah, that's okay, I get it.

1157
00:46:32,677 --> 00:46:33,643
I was thinking.

1158
00:46:36,646 --> 00:46:39,549
Maybe this weekend just got a
little too weird to salvage.

1159
00:46:41,184 --> 00:46:44,922
Maybe we should just go home
and try again another time.

1160
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:46,957
Is that what you want?

1161
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:50,827
Yeah, okay.

1162
00:46:52,429 --> 00:46:55,198
Okay, then let's
go pack the car.

1163
00:47:01,303 --> 00:47:03,772
[eerie music]

1164
00:47:36,304 --> 00:47:37,605
Sure about this?

1165
00:47:37,638 --> 00:47:39,474
I don't want to break up.

1166
00:47:39,507 --> 00:47:42,243
I just don't think I'm
going to feel okay enough

1167
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,979
to have a good
time this weekend.

1168
00:47:44,012 --> 00:47:44,846
Yeah, sure.

1169
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:46,780
Thanks.

1170
00:47:52,419 --> 00:47:53,687
Driving out of here
doesn't change anything

1171
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,156
we've talked about.

1172
00:47:55,189 --> 00:47:56,958
[somber piano music]

1173
00:47:56,991 --> 00:47:58,358
You mean about us or what?

1174
00:47:58,391 --> 00:47:59,994
About us.

1175
00:48:00,027 --> 00:48:00,861
About you.

1176
00:48:02,529 --> 00:48:03,931
Leaving the cabin

1177
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,100
doesn't mean you're driving
away from your death.

1178
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:06,968
Micheal.

1179
00:48:10,336 --> 00:48:12,239
I thought we were
done with this.

1180
00:48:12,271 --> 00:48:13,439
What have I said to
give you the impression

1181
00:48:13,472 --> 00:48:14,273
that we were done with this?

1182
00:48:14,306 --> 00:48:16,109
Not you, Michael.

1183
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,443
I was hoping since
we were both sober,

1184
00:48:17,476 --> 00:48:18,344
this wouldn't happen again.

1185
00:48:18,377 --> 00:48:19,578
That would make sense

1186
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:21,514
if this was caused
by not being sober.

1187
00:48:22,715 --> 00:48:25,952
I just want to be in
my own bed by myself.

1188
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,353
I want to go home.

1189
00:48:27,386 --> 00:48:29,355
Home is with me, Gabrielle.

1190
00:48:29,388 --> 00:48:30,723
You need to understand that.

1191
00:48:30,756 --> 00:48:34,093
You want comfort,
you want security.

1192
00:48:34,126 --> 00:48:36,394
I'm the source of
all of those things.

1193
00:48:38,463 --> 00:48:39,564
I know you want me.

1194
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:41,432
You love me.

1195
00:48:42,634 --> 00:48:44,036
All you have to do
is recognize me.

1196
00:48:44,069 --> 00:48:45,503
I can't do this right now.

1197

Bring Michael back,
I want to go home!

That's where I'm
trying to take you.

So come!

of all rest and contentedness,

all kinship and life.

Yes.

1206
00:49:06,757 --> 00:49:09,194
I'm only here because our
hearts long for each other.

1207
00:49:09,227 --> 00:49:10,261
If you drive away
from this place

1208
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:12,462
where I have
approached you plainly,

1209
00:49:12,496 --> 00:49:14,232
you're driving away
from your Lord.

1210
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:16,767
You're making a choice.

1211
00:49:17,835 --> 00:49:21,838
But since this decision
is irreversible,

1212
00:49:21,871 --> 00:49:23,873
you need to know what
that truly means.

1213
00:49:23,907 --> 00:49:25,708
You have a misconception
about hell.

1214
00:49:27,177 --> 00:49:30,680
It's not a punishment,
it's a consequence.

1215
00:49:32,282 --> 00:49:34,550
In this life you
are a small rowboat,

1216
00:49:34,584 --> 00:49:36,786
adrift in the ocean
without a map.

1217
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:38,721
I'm an ocean liner
pulling up alongside you

1218
00:49:38,754 --> 00:49:41,424
and telling you I'm headed
where you need to go.

1219
00:49:42,326 --> 00:49:43,227
You have a choice.

1220
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,929
Either hit your boat to mine
and let me take you there

1221
00:49:48,097 --> 00:49:50,099
or push off from
me and drift away.

1222
00:49:51,466 --> 00:49:53,135
Life may be temporary, but you,

1223
00:49:53,169 --> 00:49:55,204
you, Gabrielle are eternal,

1224
00:49:55,238 --> 00:49:56,805
made in my eternal image.

1225
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,976
Do you understand what happens

1226
00:50:00,009 --> 00:50:01,110
if you push yourself off from me

1227
00:50:01,143 --> 00:50:02,444
and all that I am?

1228
00:50:03,612 --> 00:50:04,813
The most gentle push
away from my ship

1229
00:50:04,846 --> 00:50:06,615
may not get you very far
after just a few hours

1230
00:50:06,648 --> 00:50:07,649
or even a few days,

1231
00:50:07,682 --> 00:50:08,783
but over eternity?

1232
00:50:10,417 --> 00:50:14,022
Infinitely far and farther yet.

1233
00:50:14,055 --> 00:50:15,357
If you choose to
rid yourself of me

1234
00:50:15,389 --> 00:50:18,459
you'll lose all of me.

1235
00:50:18,492 --> 00:50:21,263
That fear you have now,
the cornered feeling.

1236
00:50:23,064 --> 00:50:25,267
You still have hope this way.

1237
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,335
Think of how you'll
feel on your first step

1238
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:29,737
of that internal walk into hell.

1239
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:34,074
The fear, the desperation
with no hope of reversal,

1240
00:50:34,108 --> 00:50:36,277
only the certainty that
the terror and anguish

1241
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,810
will become worse.

1242
00:50:37,844 --> 00:50:39,545
Can you feel the weight
of that on your shoulders?

1243
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:42,216
Can you see why I've
come to plead with you?

1244
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:45,319
It breaks my heart to
offer you everything

1245
00:50:45,352 --> 00:50:48,322
and see you requesting an
inheritance of darkness.

1246
00:50:48,355 --> 00:50:50,690
I need you to grasp this.

1247
00:50:52,059 --> 00:50:54,895
You will be denying
the divine image

1248
00:50:54,929 --> 00:50:56,130
that I have placed within you

1249
00:50:56,163 --> 00:50:58,530
that separates you
from any other animal.

1250
00:50:58,563 --> 00:51:00,465
You will feel only
the primal fear

1251
00:51:00,499 --> 00:51:01,667
of being prey.

1252
00:51:02,567 --> 00:51:03,669
As your Creator,

1253
00:51:07,006 --> 00:51:08,740
your father,

1254
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,944
do you think I want to see
you drift to the everlasting

1255
00:51:10,977 --> 00:51:14,347
knowing that with
every moment of agony,

1256
00:51:15,747 --> 00:51:18,418
every gnash of your
teeth, every hunger pang,

1257
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,386
every shallow gasp
for toxic air,

1258
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:23,587
every yearn for a drop of water,

1259
00:51:23,621 --> 00:51:25,856
every longing for even another
soul to commiserate with,

1260
00:51:25,891 --> 00:51:29,794
that you are no closer to
any semblance of relief?

1261
00:51:29,827 --> 00:51:32,097
Imagine living a
trillion trillion years

1262
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:35,633
and being no closer
than when you got there.

1263
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:37,302
The remorse that you
could have avoided it all

1264
00:51:37,336 --> 00:51:39,171
with one conversation,

1265
00:51:39,204 --> 00:51:42,274
this conversation, never leaves.

1266
00:51:43,708 --> 00:51:45,742
If you drive away
from this cabin,

1267
00:51:45,775 --> 00:51:47,144
you're driving away from me.

1268
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:51,315
And directly, directly
into this fate.

1269
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:53,683
I've come to rescue you.

1270
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,753
I've come here to save you!

1271
00:51:56,786 --> 00:51:58,389
I've come here
because I love you.

1272
00:51:58,422 --> 00:52:00,358
I made you.

1273
00:52:00,391 --> 00:52:04,728
I made you specifically
from nothing

1274
00:52:06,197 --> 00:52:07,898
because you offer the
universe something

1275
00:52:07,932 --> 00:52:09,698
no other soul is able to.

1276
00:52:09,732 --> 00:52:12,701
Losing you is worse than a
parent losing their child.

1277
00:52:14,137 --> 00:52:16,206
I want you in hell far less
than you want to be there

1278
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:19,209
but I do not drag people kicking
and screaming into heaven.

1279
00:52:20,609 --> 00:52:22,078
Paradise is an opt-in system.

1280
00:52:23,413 --> 00:52:25,482
And you opt in by
placing your trust in me,

1281
00:52:26,849 --> 00:52:28,218
hitching your boat to mine.

1282
00:52:29,386 --> 00:52:31,121
It's free, it's right
there for the taking

1283
00:52:31,154 --> 00:52:32,922
if you just take it.

1284
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:38,526
I've implored you, but
I will not demand you.

1285
00:52:39,594 --> 00:52:41,997
It is and must be your choice.

1286
00:52:43,698 --> 00:52:46,268
And we'll both live eternally
with the consequences.

1287
00:52:46,301 --> 00:52:47,903
Why are you doing this to me?

1288
00:52:47,936 --> 00:52:49,338
This is not to terrify you.

1289
00:52:49,371 --> 00:52:51,006
Though I know it does.

1290
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,207
We find ourselves in an airplane

1291
00:52:52,241 --> 00:52:53,674
that I know is going to crash,

1292
00:52:53,708 --> 00:52:55,576
and I'm begging you
to put on a parachute,

1293
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,512
but you don't
believe you need one!

1294
00:52:57,544 --> 00:52:58,845
The most merciful thing
that I can do right now

1295
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,781
is hanging by your legs
outside of the plane

1296
00:53:00,814 --> 00:53:02,283
and show you the
drop you're facing.

1297
00:53:02,316 --> 00:53:04,485
Maybe then, you'll see why
you need the parachute.

1298
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:05,685
Everything I've told you

1299
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:07,788
is what you get without me.

1300
00:53:07,821 --> 00:53:10,992
Not desiring hell is enough
to know you desire heaven.

1301
00:53:11,025 --> 00:53:14,529
And desiring heaven is enough
to know that you desire me.

1302
00:53:15,862 --> 00:53:17,098
If you're terrified
by the thought of hell

1303
00:53:17,131 --> 00:53:19,467
then you and I are
on the same team.

1304
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,768
It is that simple.

1305
00:53:22,802 --> 00:53:24,304
I hate this!

1306
00:53:24,337 --> 00:53:25,838
What's the loving thing to do

1307
00:53:25,872 --> 00:53:28,375
when someone's denying their
own self-destructive behavior?

1308
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:34,647
Doesn't an intervention
provide help for an alcoholic?

1309
00:53:36,516 --> 00:53:39,119
No matter if it's
personally difficult?

1310
00:53:40,653 --> 00:53:45,157
Or is that too
personal of a metaphor?

1311
00:53:45,191 --> 00:53:46,825
I know the guilt
hasn't left you.

1312
00:53:48,494 --> 00:53:50,695
Doubt can serve you or you it.

1313
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:51,897
And look where doubt got you

1314
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:54,133
in your mother's
final days on earth.

1315
00:53:55,301 --> 00:53:57,303
It's sending you into
even worse fate now.

1316
00:53:58,803 --> 00:54:01,874
You want knowledge, but this
just isn't a knowledge test.

1317
00:54:01,907 --> 00:54:03,542
My own know me.

1318
00:54:05,878 --> 00:54:07,379
You know who I am, Gabrielle.

1319
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,015
I just need you to say it.

1320
00:54:12,649 --> 00:54:13,684
Who am I, Gabrielle?

1321
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:16,454
We both know that
you know the answer.

1322
00:54:16,488 --> 00:54:18,622
Please tell me, who am I?

1323
00:54:24,129 --> 00:54:26,331
There's nothing
left to say, than.

1324
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:29,633
I have loved you
from eternity past

1325
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:32,636
and I will mourn you
into eternity future.

1326
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:35,139
Goodbye, my Gabrielle.

1327
00:54:41,912 --> 00:54:43,013
[Michael] It's okay.

1328
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:45,949
I'll have you home
in like six hours,

1329
00:54:45,983 --> 00:54:49,186
and don't worry about
calling me or anything

1330
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:50,154
until you're ready.

1331
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,627
What?

1332
00:54:56,659 --> 00:54:58,660
[clears throat] What's wrong?

1333
00:54:58,693 --> 00:54:59,595
Did I do it again?

1334
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,697
Gabby?

1335
00:55:02,731 --> 00:55:05,134
Oh my god.

1336
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:07,669
Gabby, I thought this
was drugs or whatever

1337
00:55:07,702 --> 00:55:09,639
but if this has happened...

1338
00:55:09,671 --> 00:55:11,340
I'm completely sober right now.

1339
00:55:13,075 --> 00:55:15,011
You have to take me home.

1340
00:55:15,044 --> 00:55:16,345
I need help.

1341
00:55:16,379 --> 00:55:18,247
- I really need help.
- I'm so scared.

1342
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:19,182
It's okay, it's okay.

1343
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:21,116
Baby, look at me, look at me.

1344
00:55:21,149 --> 00:55:23,051
It's me, I'm back.

1345
00:55:23,084 --> 00:55:24,452
No, I don't want
you back right now.

1346
00:55:24,486 --> 00:55:25,320
I want him back.

1347
00:55:25,353 --> 00:55:26,521
Him?

1348
00:55:26,555 --> 00:55:27,755
Babe there's no him,
are you serious?

1349
00:55:27,788 --> 00:55:29,424
- It's me.
- How do you know that?

1350
00:55:30,525 --> 00:55:31,993
Some of the things he said,

1351
00:55:32,027 --> 00:55:33,128
I just can't imagine them
coming from your brain.

1352
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:34,229
[Michael] But they
came out of my mouth.

1353
00:55:34,262 --> 00:55:34,930
Yeah, exactly!

1354
00:55:36,264 --> 00:55:37,566
And he knew things.

1355
00:55:38,867 --> 00:55:40,101
Michael, he knew
something about my mother

1356
00:55:40,135 --> 00:55:40,936
that I never told you.

1357
00:55:40,969 --> 00:55:41,769
That's not possible.

1358
00:55:41,802 --> 00:55:43,238
That's not possible.

1359
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:46,173
No, he said he knew
that I had the opportunity

1360
00:55:46,207 --> 00:55:48,342
to stage an
intervention for her,

1361
00:55:48,375 --> 00:55:49,809
and I didn't.

1362
00:55:49,842 --> 00:55:53,080
And I have to think if she
still had her health insurance

1363
00:55:53,113 --> 00:55:54,682
when she got sick, she would...

1364
00:55:55,782 --> 00:55:56,716
He knew how guilty

1365
00:55:56,749 --> 00:55:57,985
- I still feel.
- He said that?

1366
00:55:58,018 --> 00:55:59,220
He said that, he told
you that specifically?

1367
00:55:59,253 --> 00:56:01,088
He said that this was
like an intervention.

1368
00:56:01,121 --> 00:56:02,656
And he knew my guilt.

1369
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:03,856
And then he mentioned my mom.

1370
00:56:03,891 --> 00:56:07,094
That's not the same
thing as knowing.

1371
00:56:07,127 --> 00:56:09,462
Your own guilt is forcing you
to connect a bunch of dots

1372
00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:10,363
that aren't really there.

1373
00:56:10,396 --> 00:56:11,464
You don't know that.

1374
00:56:11,497 --> 00:56:12,831
I want to talk to God again.

1375
00:56:12,865 --> 00:56:13,933
Make him come back!

1376
00:56:13,967 --> 00:56:15,435
Make him come back!

1377
00:56:15,468 --> 00:56:19,505
Stop making the breakdown
that I'm having about you.

1378
00:56:19,539 --> 00:56:21,007
You're not the one
in danger here.

1379
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,676
My brain is breaking, okay?

1380
00:56:24,544 --> 00:56:26,112
We have to go home.

1381
00:56:26,145 --> 00:56:26,946
I'm not driving like this.

1382
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,448
I can't do that.

1383
00:56:28,481 --> 00:56:31,750
We're in an emergency
situation here, all right?

1384
00:56:31,783 --> 00:56:33,385
You need to be brave.

1385
00:56:33,418 --> 00:56:35,254
What if I have another
episode while I'm driving?

1386
00:56:35,287 --> 00:56:36,488
I could hurt us or worse.

1387
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:38,056
I'm not driving right now!

1388
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:39,091
You have to!

1389
00:56:40,058 --> 00:56:42,261
No, he told me that if I left

1390
00:56:42,294 --> 00:56:43,462
he would accept
that as my answer.

1391
00:56:43,495 --> 00:56:45,097
I would be going to hell!

1392
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:46,565
He didn't say anything!

1393
00:56:46,598 --> 00:56:48,166
It's me.

1394
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,102
You're not dying, you're
not going to hell.

1395
00:56:50,135 --> 00:56:52,537
I said those things
because I am sick.

1396
00:56:53,771 --> 00:56:54,940
Here, take these keys.

1397
00:56:54,973 --> 00:56:56,974
Take these keys from
me, switch seats with me

1398
00:56:57,008 --> 00:56:58,009
and drive us home.

1399
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:01,412
Please, this is life
or death, Gabrielle.

1400
00:57:03,714 --> 00:57:05,182
Why did you call me Gabrielle?

1401
00:57:05,216 --> 00:57:07,151
Because it's your name.

1402
00:57:07,184 --> 00:57:09,220
You never call me Gabrielle.

1403
00:57:09,253 --> 00:57:11,122
Take the keys.

1404
00:57:11,155 --> 00:57:12,990
Come on, this could be
seizures for all we know!

1405
00:57:13,024 --> 00:57:15,960
Baby, we can't afford
to waste our time.

1406
00:57:15,993 --> 00:57:17,361
Please, please.

1407
00:57:38,814 --> 00:57:42,385
[intense electronic music]

1408
00:58:25,393 --> 00:58:26,227
Okay.

1409
00:58:28,329 --> 00:58:29,163
God?

1410
00:58:30,631 --> 00:58:32,500
Please come back.

1411
00:58:32,533 --> 00:58:33,934
I need to talk to you again.

1412
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:38,105
Please?

1413
00:58:39,272 --> 00:58:40,474
I'm open, I promise.

1414
00:58:40,507 --> 00:58:41,942
I just have some questions

1415
00:58:41,975 --> 00:58:43,677
and I want to get to the
bottom of what's happening.

1416
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:45,078
It's no use, Gabby.

1417
00:58:45,112 --> 00:58:46,012
This doesn't concern you.

1418
00:58:46,046 --> 00:58:47,114
This is between me and him.

1419
00:58:47,147 --> 00:58:48,248
It wasn't God that
was talking to you.

1420
00:58:48,281 --> 00:58:49,249
That was me.

1421
00:58:49,282 --> 00:58:50,350
You need to get that

1422
00:58:50,384 --> 00:58:51,451
- through your head.
- How would you know that?

1423
00:58:51,485 --> 00:58:52,119
You weren't there.

1424
00:58:53,353 --> 00:58:56,022
Please, God, talk to me
through Michael again.

1425
00:58:58,290 --> 00:58:59,392
Why don't we black
out the windows

1426
00:58:59,425 --> 00:59:00,659
or light some candles

1427
00:59:00,693 --> 00:59:01,627
- or something?
- It's not a seance, dude.

1428
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:02,361
Then what are we doing?

1429
00:59:02,395 --> 00:59:02,995
I don't know.

1430
00:59:03,028 --> 00:59:03,829
Prayer, I guess?

1431
00:59:05,731 --> 00:59:06,532
Prayer?

1432
00:59:06,565 --> 00:59:07,666
Yeah, prayer.

1433
00:59:13,139 --> 00:59:14,306
[gentle piano music]

1434
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:15,174
Prayer.

1435
00:59:23,548 --> 00:59:24,382
Dear God.

1436
00:59:26,851 --> 00:59:29,287
If there is a God, I know
you can hear me right now.

1437
00:59:30,455 --> 00:59:32,257
I don't know what's
going on with Michael.

1438
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:33,291
I just don't.

1439
00:59:34,959 --> 00:59:38,396
But if I do have a creator

1440
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:41,566
and if I have any
obligation to you,

1441
00:59:43,067 --> 00:59:43,903
I want to know.

1442
00:59:45,436 --> 00:59:47,404
And if I'm in a
dangerous situation

1443
00:59:47,438 --> 00:59:48,405
and you can get me out of it,

1444
00:59:48,439 --> 00:59:51,041
then I need your help.

1445
00:59:54,144 --> 00:59:57,548
I'm little and you are big.

1446
01:00:02,252 --> 01:00:04,321
I'm confused and scared and

1447
01:00:05,489 --> 01:00:07,257
I don't even know what
I need or want right now

1448
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:08,892
but you do.

1449
01:00:08,926 --> 01:00:12,628
So please, anything.

1450
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,367
Don't abandon me here.

1451
01:00:21,637 --> 01:00:22,472
Shit.

1452
01:00:25,608 --> 01:00:26,776
Did anything happen?

1453
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:28,311
Did I do it again?

1454
01:00:29,278 --> 01:00:30,146
You see?

1455
01:00:31,047 --> 01:00:33,081
See, it's not real.

1456
01:00:34,282 --> 01:00:35,952
If God was talking
to you through me,

1457
01:00:37,819 --> 01:00:38,587
why wouldn't he answer that?

1458
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:39,788
I don't know.

1459
01:00:40,722 --> 01:00:41,958
Maybe it's too late.

1460
01:00:41,990 --> 01:00:44,426
Maybe the car is my last
chance and I blew it.

1461
01:00:46,761 --> 01:00:47,930
Maybe I'm damned.

1462
01:00:49,464 --> 01:00:50,732
Let's just go home.

1463
01:00:50,765 --> 01:00:52,100
This is all going to be
a bad memory, all right?

1464
01:00:52,133 --> 01:00:53,301
No, if this is
really happening,

1465
01:00:53,335 --> 01:00:55,337
then driving home finalizes it.

1466
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:57,137
As long as we're
here, there's hope.

1467
01:01:00,474 --> 01:01:02,376
Okay.

1468
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:03,244
Okay.

1469
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:06,647
I'm gonna make you some dinner.

1470
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,449
You barely ate today.

1471
01:01:41,214 --> 01:01:42,048
I love you.

1472
01:01:43,216 --> 01:01:45,250
Don't forget that, okay?

1473
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,084
Yeah.

1474
01:01:47,052 --> 01:01:47,854
I love you too.

1475
01:01:49,755 --> 01:01:51,557
Probably won't be
the most exciting part

1476
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:53,292
of the weekend anymore, but

1477
01:01:54,459 --> 01:01:56,628
this does happen
to be my specialty.

1478
01:01:58,330 --> 01:01:59,565
Try to eat something.

1479
01:01:59,598 --> 01:02:00,799
You need it.

1480
01:02:00,832 --> 01:02:03,235
And it's delicious if
I may say so myself.

1481
01:02:06,705 --> 01:02:08,539
Come on, it's not
that horrid, is it?

1482
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:10,675
No.

1483
01:02:12,143 --> 01:02:14,679
It just occurred to me that
this could be my last meal.

1484
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:19,083
Am I going crazy?

1485
01:02:20,484 --> 01:02:22,520
I hate seeing you like this.

1486
01:02:22,553 --> 01:02:23,821
Look where you are.

1487
01:02:23,855 --> 01:02:25,356
Here with me, okay?

1488
01:02:25,389 --> 01:02:26,858
You're safe here.

1489
01:02:26,892 --> 01:02:28,559
I'm not going to let
anything hurt you.

1490
01:02:28,593 --> 01:02:31,596
We could crash driving home
on Sunday for all I know.

1491
01:02:31,629 --> 01:02:34,497
Let's call off work
and go back on Monday.

1492
01:02:34,531 --> 01:02:36,399
I won't let anything
happen to you.

1493
01:02:36,433 --> 01:02:37,300
I promise.

1494
01:02:38,201 --> 01:02:39,036
You're sweet.

1495
01:02:40,203 --> 01:02:42,439
You are, but this
is bigger than you.

1496
01:02:42,472 --> 01:02:44,341
It really isn't.

1497
01:02:44,374 --> 01:02:46,043
It is me.

1498
01:02:46,077 --> 01:02:48,244
I'm the one who put
this fear in to you.

1499
01:02:48,278 --> 01:02:49,546
Okay, I find it
more concerning

1500
01:02:49,579 --> 01:02:51,114
that you're fighting
so hard to tell me

1501
01:02:51,147 --> 01:02:53,050
that nothing's really happening.

1502
01:02:53,084 --> 01:02:54,551
You know, if you
were screwing with me

1503
01:02:54,584 --> 01:02:56,785
you'd just let me believe it.

1504
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:58,088
All the more likely
option that I have

1505
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,056
some sort of psychosis.

1506
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:01,523
Yeah, well then your psychosis

1507
01:03:01,557 --> 01:03:03,726
does a really fucking
convincing God impression.

1508
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:09,398
Okay.

1509
01:03:09,431 --> 01:03:10,499
I know you're scared,

1510
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,204
but right now there is
nothing scary happening.

1511
01:03:15,237 --> 01:03:17,941
Right now, we are a
boyfriend and a girlfriend

1512
01:03:17,974 --> 01:03:20,541
sitting down to
have a nice romantic

1513
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,111
home cooked dinner together.

1514
01:03:23,778 --> 01:03:25,346
Don't worry about anything else.

1515
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,249
Let's just sit here and
enjoy each other's company.

1516
01:03:28,282 --> 01:03:30,953
I don't know where I'm going
to be this time tomorrow.

1517
01:03:30,986 --> 01:03:33,122
There is a wide range
of possibilities

1518
01:03:33,154 --> 01:03:35,256
and one of them is in hell.

1519
01:03:36,457 --> 01:03:38,127
How can you expect me to
get that out of my mind?

1520
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:40,528
Because it doesn't make
any sense to believe that.

1521
01:03:40,561 --> 01:03:42,230
God doesn't use
people as puppets.

1522
01:03:42,263 --> 01:03:44,331
Okay well if he did,
would the puppet know?

1523
01:03:44,364 --> 01:03:45,499
We can't know for certain

1524
01:03:45,532 --> 01:03:46,500
and that means that
there is a chance

1525
01:03:46,533 --> 01:03:48,102
that my clock is ticking.

1526
01:03:49,269 --> 01:03:51,738
I'm so sorry that
I've done this to you.

1527
01:03:51,772 --> 01:03:54,574
I think we're both gonna
need therapy after this.

1528
01:03:54,608 --> 01:03:56,176
Yeah, if there
is an after this.

1529
01:04:00,814 --> 01:04:01,748
You like the wine?

1530
01:04:04,418 --> 01:04:05,285
Yeah? Me too.

1531
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,625
1989 Malbec.

1532
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,728
Bottled in Napa Valley.

1533
01:04:18,531 --> 01:04:21,101
You ever wonder if they
just put random dates

1534
01:04:21,134 --> 01:04:22,601
on these things?

1535
01:04:22,635 --> 01:04:24,303
Yeah how do you know
it was bottled in 1989,

1536
01:04:24,336 --> 01:04:25,504
not like 2009?

1537
01:04:27,007 --> 01:04:28,541
You think you can
tell a difference?

1538
01:04:29,508 --> 01:04:31,210
Nope, I guess not.

1539
01:04:31,243 --> 01:04:32,912
And Napa Valley.

1540
01:04:34,046 --> 01:04:35,613
That's kind of
obvious, isn't it?

1541
01:04:37,883 --> 01:04:40,385
If I was going to make up where
my fraudulent wine came from

1542
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,586
I would say Napa Valley.

1543
01:04:41,619 --> 01:04:43,455
It's like an
archetypical wine place.

1544
01:04:44,622 --> 01:04:46,558
Hmm, even a bit
of a cliche right?

1545
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,060
Okay.

1546
01:04:48,094 --> 01:04:51,696
I appreciate you trying
to take my mind off this.

1547
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:53,832
But please stop.

1548
01:04:54,967 --> 01:04:57,035
I just want some silence
for a minute, okay.

1549
01:04:57,068 --> 01:04:58,535
Just food for thought.

1550
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:06,810
Think this stuff could be
a bootleg bathtub wine?

1551
01:05:06,845 --> 01:05:08,545
I'm not worried about it.

1552
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:10,781
I'm sure there is some
kind of regulation in place

1553
01:05:10,814 --> 01:05:12,917
that keeps people
from just lying

1554
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:15,586
about what they're
selling like that, okay?

1555
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:16,420
Yeah.

1556
01:05:19,124 --> 01:05:20,623
You're sure about that though?

1557
01:05:21,724 --> 01:05:22,725
How are you so sure?

1558
01:05:24,393 --> 01:05:25,661
What do you mean?

1559
01:05:25,695 --> 01:05:28,165
You said I'm sure there is,

1560
01:05:28,198 --> 01:05:30,000
not, maybe there is.

1561
01:05:31,834 --> 01:05:33,036
How do you know?

1562
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:35,338
Do you know there are
regulations in place

1563
01:05:35,371 --> 01:05:37,707
or do you just trust that
what the bottle says is true?

1564
01:05:39,675 --> 01:05:41,011
I don't know.

1565
01:05:41,044 --> 01:05:41,879
Hmm.

1566
01:05:43,613 --> 01:05:44,579
But you believe it.

1567
01:05:45,647 --> 01:05:46,548
It's weird, right?

1568
01:05:47,749 --> 01:05:51,087
If you think about it,
really think about it,

1569
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,320
a majority of your life,

1570
01:05:52,354 --> 01:05:54,790
your beliefs, your opinions,

1571
01:05:54,823 --> 01:05:57,126
even things you hold
to be cold hard facts,

1572
01:05:57,160 --> 01:06:00,762
they all have their
foundation in faith,

1573
01:06:00,796 --> 01:06:01,797
not knowledge, right?

1574
01:06:04,466 --> 01:06:06,202
You believe without
question that this,

1575
01:06:06,235 --> 01:06:10,471
this wine was bottled
in 1989 in Napa Valley.

1576
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,108
Why?

1577
01:06:13,141 --> 01:06:14,475
Because it says on a label?

1578
01:06:15,576 --> 01:06:17,179
You haven't checked,
you don't know

1579
01:06:18,546 --> 01:06:19,480
But you believe it.

1580
01:06:20,916 --> 01:06:22,349
You trust authority
for big stuff.

1581
01:06:22,383 --> 01:06:25,686
Like the sun is 93
million miles away.

1582
01:06:25,719 --> 01:06:26,955
You see that in a textbook,

1583
01:06:26,988 --> 01:06:28,622
you have no trouble
believing it at all.

1584
01:06:30,058 --> 01:06:33,593
From the littlest things
to the largest foundations

1585
01:06:33,626 --> 01:06:36,263
of your core beliefs
about reality.

1586
01:06:36,297 --> 01:06:40,234
Almost everything you feel
you know with certainty

1587
01:06:40,267 --> 01:06:41,334
stems from faith.

1588
01:06:43,736 --> 01:06:44,771
What's one more jump?

1589
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:50,311
I'm asking you to
trust my answer

1590
01:06:50,343 --> 01:06:52,146
to the biggest question,

1591
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,916
because you trust that
I'm the highest authority.

1592
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:59,152
There's another
reason why I only

1593
01:06:59,185 --> 01:07:00,686
communicate with human beings

1594
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:02,889
against the boundaries
of their reality

1595
01:07:02,922 --> 01:07:05,024
while they're still
in their lifetime.

1596
01:07:05,058 --> 01:07:09,195
I'm not concerned with whether
or not you believe in me.

1597
01:07:10,696 --> 01:07:12,866
I want to know whether
or not you trust me.

1598
01:07:14,033 --> 01:07:16,735
And for there to be
real trust, true faith,

1599
01:07:16,768 --> 01:07:19,839
it has to grow in spite
of a temptation to doubt.

1600
01:07:22,207 --> 01:07:23,608
If you could be certain,

1601
01:07:23,641 --> 01:07:24,675
if I was the safe option,

1602
01:07:24,709 --> 01:07:27,980
well, that's not faith, is it?

1603
01:07:28,013 --> 01:07:29,047
It's practicality.

1604
01:07:33,417 --> 01:07:35,586
Yup, just like I suspected

1605
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:37,856
that is crap wine from
outside Pittsburgh.

1606
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:42,895
Who am I, Gabrielle?

1607
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:44,996
Who am I?

1608
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:47,265
God?

1609
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:49,367
The one and only.

1610
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,003
And what does that make you?

1611
01:07:53,703 --> 01:07:56,274
A child of God, my daughter.

1612
01:07:57,942 --> 01:07:58,876
You didn't leave.

1613
01:08:00,845 --> 01:08:03,180
Well, why didn't you answer me

1614
01:08:03,214 --> 01:08:05,116
when I called out to you?

1615
01:08:05,149 --> 01:08:06,250
I was desperate.

1616
01:08:06,284 --> 01:08:07,484
It wasn't the right time.

1617
01:08:07,517 --> 01:08:10,387
Why does it always
have to be your time?

1618
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:12,688
If you really love me, then

1619
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:14,657
why not come when I needed you?

1620
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:16,893
My time is your time.

1621
01:08:19,129 --> 01:08:21,064
But by effectiveness, not need.

1622
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:25,434
Mysterious ways.

1623
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:30,874
I need some air.

1624
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,715
So you're really the creator.

1625
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:43,319
Of everything.

1626
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:45,054
I am.

1627
01:08:48,589 --> 01:08:49,425
Of me?

1628
01:08:50,625 --> 01:08:52,827
You created me?

1629
01:08:52,861 --> 01:08:55,097
Well, you're a part of
everything, aren't you?

1630
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:57,932
I decided that you
specifically you

1631
01:08:57,966 --> 01:09:00,634
were so worthy of eternal love

1632
01:09:00,667 --> 01:09:03,838
that I brought you into existence
just to give that to you.

1633
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:07,241
And everything that I do, I
do out of my love for you.

1634
01:09:07,275 --> 01:09:09,543
So am I special in some way?

1635
01:09:09,576 --> 01:09:10,445
Of course.

1636
01:09:11,611 --> 01:09:12,981
But every person is.

1637
01:09:14,082 --> 01:09:16,017
I love every individual
one of you so much

1638
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:19,287
that I created the entire
universe for each of you alone.

1639
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,422
I don't get it.

1640
01:09:22,456 --> 01:09:25,459
In all of history
and all of future,

1641
01:09:25,491 --> 01:09:26,860
there are trillions of you.

1642
01:09:28,228 --> 01:09:29,930
But if it were just one
person as the sole human being

1643
01:09:29,963 --> 01:09:33,000
I would have created everything
for just the two of us.

1644
01:09:34,234 --> 01:09:39,239
My undying love for every person

1645
01:09:40,673 --> 01:09:42,242
doesn't overshadow the love
that I have for you alone.

1646
01:09:43,676 --> 01:09:47,980
Okay, so everyone is just as
important as everybody else?

1647
01:09:49,882 --> 01:09:52,385
In an important but
specific way, absolutely.

1648
01:09:53,386 --> 01:09:56,455
Okay, well then why me?

1649
01:09:56,489 --> 01:09:59,291
Why give me this experience
and not other people?

1650
01:09:59,325 --> 01:10:00,625
I reach out to everyone.

1651
01:10:00,658 --> 01:10:03,561
Trust me, everyone.

1652
01:10:03,595 --> 01:10:05,197
But it's only the people who
have their hearts open to me

1653
01:10:05,231 --> 01:10:07,133
that I can do anything
like this for.

1654
01:10:08,066 --> 01:10:10,135
It's not just who wants.

1655
01:10:10,168 --> 01:10:12,137
It's who yearns, and you did.

1656
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:16,274
You loved me.

1657
01:10:17,108 --> 01:10:18,309
You just didn't know me.

1658
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:20,945
I wanted you?

1659
01:10:20,979 --> 01:10:23,714
I told you to your face I
thought you were a psychopath.

1660
01:10:23,747 --> 01:10:24,815
I didn't believe you!

1661
01:10:26,717 --> 01:10:28,186
But you kept talking to me.

1662
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,423
Your heart wanted it to be true,

1663
01:10:32,722 --> 01:10:34,992
but your mind just
wouldn't let you accept it.

1664
01:10:36,193 --> 01:10:38,395
Your heart matters,
that stuff matters.

1665
01:10:40,696 --> 01:10:42,466
I can't believe
this is happening.

1666
01:10:42,499 --> 01:10:44,501
No, but you do, don't you?

1667
01:10:45,502 --> 01:10:46,270
Yeah.

1668
01:10:47,603 --> 01:10:48,872
It's just a little intense.

1669
01:10:48,906 --> 01:10:50,541
I mean, you're fucking God!

1670
01:10:50,573 --> 01:10:51,375
Shit, sorry.

1671
01:10:52,843 --> 01:10:55,479
Think that's something
I haven't heard before?

1672
01:10:55,512 --> 01:10:56,979
Don't censor yourself.

1673
01:10:57,013 --> 01:10:58,381
I know your intentions.

1674
01:10:58,414 --> 01:11:00,615
I want you to be honest with me.

1675
01:11:00,649 --> 01:11:04,887
Promise not to
smite me or anything?

1676
01:11:04,921 --> 01:11:06,788
Well you've made so
much progress today.

1677
01:11:06,822 --> 01:11:07,990
You think I'd really
throw that all away

1678
01:11:08,024 --> 01:11:08,925
and smite you now?

1679
01:11:10,026 --> 01:11:11,527
I mean, I don't know.

1680
01:11:11,561 --> 01:11:13,029
I don't know how you work.

1681
01:11:13,062 --> 01:11:14,530
A few hours ago you were
going to send me to hell.

1682
01:11:14,564 --> 01:11:16,165
How do I know you won't
get fed up and just do it?

1683
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:17,500
Because I don't
want you to go there.

1684
01:11:17,533 --> 01:11:19,235
And I don't get fed up.

1685
01:11:19,268 --> 01:11:21,570
Patience is sort of part
of the whole God gig.

1686
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:26,308
Okay so what do
I still have to do?

1687
01:11:26,341 --> 01:11:27,109
Am I good?

1688
01:11:27,142 --> 01:11:30,112
Am I going to heaven?

1689
01:11:30,145 --> 01:11:31,546
Well, you've gotten
over the first hurdle.

1690
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,547
You believe me.

1691
01:11:32,581 --> 01:11:34,850
Now you have to trust me.

1692
01:11:35,783 --> 01:11:37,052
Okay?

1693
01:11:37,085 --> 01:11:38,053
Fine, I trust you.

1694
01:11:39,321 --> 01:11:40,956
Your heart has to trust me.

1695
01:11:40,989 --> 01:11:43,058
Like I said, these
things matter.

1696
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:45,025
I do, I said, I trust you

1697
01:11:45,059 --> 01:11:47,962
Going to heaven isn't a matter
of saying some magic words.

1698
01:11:47,995 --> 01:11:49,430
You believe me,

1699
01:11:49,463 --> 01:11:51,631
but you don't trust me.

1700
01:11:52,533 --> 01:11:54,335
When the plane is going down,

1701
01:11:54,368 --> 01:11:56,437
you have to believe in a
parachute to know that it's there

1702
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:58,805
but you have to trust
it to put it on.

1703
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:00,841
When you're falling
towards earth,

1704
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:02,309
do you think that your belief

1705
01:12:02,343 --> 01:12:03,844
in the idea of a parachute
is enough to save you?

1706
01:12:03,878 --> 01:12:06,679
Or do you have to trust it so
completely that you put it on?

1707
01:12:08,615 --> 01:12:09,681
You have to trust me.

1708
01:12:10,816 --> 01:12:12,018
You've got to put me on.

1709
01:12:13,453 --> 01:12:14,888
I don't know how to
make my heart trust you.

1710
01:12:14,921 --> 01:12:16,956
It doesn't even sound
like a real thing.

1711
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:17,991
Of course it is.

1712
01:12:18,024 --> 01:12:19,325
Here, hold out your pinky.

1713
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:22,996
Hmm?

1714
01:12:23,029 --> 01:12:24,796
You know what this
is, don't you?

1715
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:25,832
A pinky promise.

1716
01:12:25,865 --> 01:12:27,033
Yes.

1717
01:12:27,066 --> 01:12:28,868
It is among the
purest representations

1718
01:12:28,902 --> 01:12:30,769
of trust that you have.

1719
01:12:30,802 --> 01:12:33,272
You don't know, you
have a pinky promise.

1720
01:12:33,305 --> 01:12:35,174
That means something,
it's honored.

1721
01:12:36,308 --> 01:12:37,142
Come here.

1722
01:12:38,809 --> 01:12:40,245
This is what I'm offering you.

1723
01:12:40,279 --> 01:12:43,215
A pinky promise of the
reality of the situation,

1724
01:12:43,248 --> 01:12:45,984
of my character,
of your destiny.

1725
01:12:46,018 --> 01:12:48,819
You can't know, but you can
accept my pinkie promises.

1726
01:12:48,854 --> 01:12:50,788
You've accepted
Michael's before.

1727
01:12:50,821 --> 01:12:51,957
Yeah, but that's different.

1728
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:53,525
I know Michael.

1729
01:12:53,559 --> 01:12:54,759
I'm just meeting you.

1730
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:57,061
Oh no, you're
just recognizing me.

1731
01:12:57,094 --> 01:12:58,829
You fell in love with Michael.

1732
01:12:58,863 --> 01:13:00,198
Why?

1733
01:13:00,231 --> 01:13:00,965
I don't know.

1734
01:13:00,998 --> 01:13:02,200
I just did.

1735
01:13:02,233 --> 01:13:03,401
Tell me what you
love about him.

1736
01:13:05,136 --> 01:13:08,738
He's gentle, funny.

1737
01:13:09,706 --> 01:13:11,475
Intimidatingly intelligent.

1738
01:13:11,509 --> 01:13:12,843
He's caring.

1739
01:13:14,378 --> 01:13:15,880
Well, not to brag,

1740
01:13:15,913 --> 01:13:19,283
but you're looking at the
inventor of those things.

1741
01:13:19,317 --> 01:13:21,451
People are only able
to be gentle or funny

1742
01:13:21,484 --> 01:13:24,588
or caring or kind or intelligent

1743
01:13:24,621 --> 01:13:26,990
because they're made
in the image of,

1744
01:13:27,023 --> 01:13:28,858
well, you're looking at him.

1745
01:13:30,627 --> 01:13:31,595
When you fell in
love with Michael

1746
01:13:31,628 --> 01:13:33,597
for the things that reflect me,

1747
01:13:33,630 --> 01:13:36,233
you fell in love with me.

1748
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:38,801
You just didn't know it yet.

1749
01:13:40,036 --> 01:13:42,439
That's how I know you're mine.

1750
01:13:42,472 --> 01:13:43,973
Your heart wants me.

1751
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:47,843
So how can I get
it to trust you?

1752
01:13:47,876 --> 01:13:50,778
You can start by being
honest about why you don't.

1753
01:13:50,812 --> 01:13:52,681
I don't know that I don't.

1754
01:13:52,715 --> 01:13:53,781
Yes you do.

1755
01:13:55,251 --> 01:13:56,952
But you have to
say that out loud

1756
01:13:56,986 --> 01:13:57,920
and you have to say it to me.

1757
01:13:57,953 --> 01:14:00,055
That's how we work through this.

1758
01:14:00,089 --> 01:14:01,223
You're anxious about
putting it out there

1759
01:14:01,257 --> 01:14:03,058
because you think that

1760
01:14:03,092 --> 01:14:04,860
saying something
will make me upset

1761
01:14:04,893 --> 01:14:06,929
or telling me will
make me withdraw.

1762
01:14:08,296 --> 01:14:11,299
You think if you say
it, it could damn you.

1763
01:14:13,134 --> 01:14:15,470
You need to grab
hold of two things.

1764
01:14:15,503 --> 01:14:17,105
First, there isn't
anything you can tell me

1765
01:14:17,138 --> 01:14:18,840
that I don't already know.

1766
01:14:18,873 --> 01:14:20,807
It's not a secret just because
you haven't said it out loud,

1767
01:14:20,842 --> 01:14:22,477
it is a festering wound.

1768
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:25,880
When you bring it to me,
you're giving it air.

1769
01:14:25,913 --> 01:14:28,316
What you're not doing is
providing me with new information.

1770
01:14:28,349 --> 01:14:30,084
I know it already.

1771
01:14:30,118 --> 01:14:31,185
And I love you still.

1772
01:14:32,452 --> 01:14:35,088
And second, there's
nothing you can do

1773
01:14:35,122 --> 01:14:37,291
to change the way
that I feel about you.

1774
01:14:37,324 --> 01:14:39,893
Unconditional love
isn't a dull platitude.

1775
01:14:41,595 --> 01:14:43,830
Unconditional has a
real meaning here.

1776
01:14:43,864 --> 01:14:46,633
Without conditions,

1777
01:14:46,667 --> 01:14:49,369
even if it's harmful or
even if you do something

1778
01:14:49,403 --> 01:14:50,470
to upset me.

1779
01:14:51,838 --> 01:14:53,206
You wouldn't kick your
dog out of the house

1780
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:54,408
for chewing up your
favorite slippers

1781
01:14:54,441 --> 01:14:57,143
or smite your toddler
for talking back.

1782
01:14:57,176 --> 01:14:59,545
The love and responsibility
are unconditional.

1783
01:15:01,714 --> 01:15:03,716
If I withdrew from you
because of something you said

1784
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:05,184
or did or felt, well,

1785
01:15:06,285 --> 01:15:08,020
that'd be a condition,
wouldn't it?

1786
01:15:09,188 --> 01:15:10,923
Yeah, I guess so.

1787
01:15:12,391 --> 01:15:13,459
I just don't get it.

1788
01:15:15,294 --> 01:15:16,128
You know?

1789
01:15:17,396 --> 01:15:18,397
If you're God,

1790
01:15:19,298 --> 01:15:21,566
Okay, you are God, but,

1791
01:15:23,635 --> 01:15:26,071
if there's a God then
I just don't get it.

1792
01:15:26,104 --> 01:15:29,674
I mean, you told me
why you're not obvious,

1793
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:32,277
but you still left us
alone with a lot of shit.

1794
01:15:33,611 --> 01:15:34,612
With evil.

1795
01:15:36,581 --> 01:15:38,083
Why would you let that happen?

1796
01:15:39,351 --> 01:15:41,319
You let the Holocaust happen.

1797
01:15:42,654 --> 01:15:46,590
You let people get
kidnapped, and raped,

1798
01:15:46,623 --> 01:15:48,592
and suffer constantly.

1799
01:15:48,625 --> 01:15:52,496
Wars, earthquakes, children
with fucking bone cancer.

1800
01:15:54,365 --> 01:15:56,533
And then you judge us?

1801
01:15:58,635 --> 01:16:02,573
You told me that I'm going
to hell for eternity.

1802
01:16:02,606 --> 01:16:05,175
What kind of perverted
sense of justice is that?

1803
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:09,145
And then you show up
here threatening me

1804
01:16:09,178 --> 01:16:10,413
to love you and to trust you

1805
01:16:10,446 --> 01:16:12,081
or you're going
to send me to it?

1806
01:16:13,349 --> 01:16:15,017
How am I supposed to
trust you after that?

1807
01:16:15,051 --> 01:16:16,252
You're holding a gun to my head

1808
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:18,554
and telling me that I
have to get in line.

1809
01:16:18,588 --> 01:16:21,791
You know, in what
universe is that love?

1810
01:16:22,892 --> 01:16:24,093
Unconditional love?

1811
01:16:24,127 --> 01:16:26,729
You know, you made me,
I didn't ask to be born.

1812
01:16:28,131 --> 01:16:30,366
You put me here and you put
me here how I am, right?

1813
01:16:31,767 --> 01:16:34,603
So if I've got faulty
hardware and I malfunction

1814
01:16:34,636 --> 01:16:36,938
then that's on you, dude,
you're the designer.

1815
01:16:38,407 --> 01:16:40,175
Where's the justice in
punishing me forever

1816
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:42,477
for being exactly as
you fucking made me?

1817
01:16:44,045 --> 01:16:46,448
Where do you get off
making people imperfectly

1818
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:48,583
and then damning them
for being imperfect?

1819
01:16:50,986 --> 01:16:52,687
You know I was
worried for a minute

1820
01:16:52,721 --> 01:16:55,790
that Michael was a
manipulative psycho,

1821
01:16:55,824 --> 01:16:57,258
but the more that
I think about it,

1822
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:59,994
the more that this feels like
the abusive relationship.

1823
01:17:00,027 --> 01:17:02,163
You know, you're holding
my eternity hostage

1824
01:17:02,196 --> 01:17:04,198
and I'm supposed to
believe you're good?

1825
01:17:05,867 --> 01:17:06,700
So okay.

1826
01:17:07,903 --> 01:17:09,370
You're right, I believe you.

1827
01:17:10,438 --> 01:17:11,572
You're God.

1828
01:17:12,973 --> 01:17:15,042
And since you're God,
you can go fuck yourself!

1829
01:17:17,378 --> 01:17:19,646
I didn't mean that exactly.

1830
01:17:21,314 --> 01:17:23,683
I mean, obviously I
don't want to go to hell.

1831
01:17:25,685 --> 01:17:27,153
I don't want to

1832
01:17:27,187 --> 01:17:29,456
write you off and
be tortured forever.

1833
01:17:29,489 --> 01:17:31,558
But I just, I don't
fucking get it.

1834
01:17:31,591 --> 01:17:36,596
And I'm scared, and to be
honest, I'm pissed off.

1835
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:38,498
Yes, good.

1836
01:17:38,531 --> 01:17:40,099
Those feelings come
from the divine spark

1837
01:17:40,133 --> 01:17:41,734
that I've given you.

1838
01:17:41,768 --> 01:17:44,603
You're right to be upset that
anybody at all is in hell.

1839
01:17:44,636 --> 01:17:46,538
Because you know
that they have value.

1840
01:17:46,572 --> 01:17:50,108
You know that when things are
wrong and people are hurt,

1841
01:17:50,142 --> 01:17:51,878
that that's not right.

1842
01:17:51,911 --> 01:17:53,545
You know that because you
weren't created to live

1843
01:17:53,579 --> 01:17:54,746
among evil and injustice.

1844
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:56,148
Your soul wants perfection.

1845
01:17:57,349 --> 01:17:58,550
Your soul wants me.

1846
01:17:58,584 --> 01:17:59,985
Yeah but you created
it, you made the world.

1847
01:18:00,018 --> 01:18:00,854
I did.

1848
01:18:02,421 --> 01:18:03,622
But that doesn't mean

1849
01:18:03,655 --> 01:18:05,657
that I like everything
that happens in it.

1850
01:18:05,691 --> 01:18:07,025
These things you're
highlighting are things

1851
01:18:07,059 --> 01:18:08,426
that grieve me as well.

1852
01:18:09,895 --> 01:18:12,597
I yearn for justice.

1853
01:18:13,764 --> 01:18:15,700
I mourn for those in
hell the same as you.

1854
01:18:17,101 --> 01:18:19,337
I gave humanity this world,

1855
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:20,939
but I did not create
the evil in it.

1856
01:18:20,973 --> 01:18:23,040
You did, all of you.

1857
01:18:23,074 --> 01:18:24,542
Unlike some faulty hardware,

1858
01:18:24,575 --> 01:18:28,679
you are a moral agent
with a free will.

1859
01:18:28,713 --> 01:18:32,182
Humanity chose evil voluntarily.

1860
01:18:34,184 --> 01:18:37,087
Allow me to properly refocus
your righteous anger.

1861
01:18:39,824 --> 01:18:40,657
[Gabby] Fine.

1862
01:18:44,829 --> 01:18:46,096
I'm building something.

1863
01:18:47,531 --> 01:18:50,300
A community of people who
live together as equals,

1864
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:53,503
treating each other with
love and respect voluntarily.

1865
01:18:53,537 --> 01:18:55,839
I don't want robots who do my
bidding because they have to.

1866
01:18:55,872 --> 01:18:59,174
I intend to live among my
people, not rule over them.

1867
01:19:00,442 --> 01:19:01,610
So the problem arises.

1868
01:19:03,013 --> 01:19:05,314
How do we make a
community of people

1869
01:19:05,347 --> 01:19:08,985
who are not forced to be happy,

1870
01:19:09,019 --> 01:19:10,252
but choose to?

1871
01:19:11,687 --> 01:19:12,989
By giving them choice.

1872
01:19:13,023 --> 01:19:15,025
Creating people
inside of a utopia

1873
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,862
that have no choice
whether or not to be there,

1874
01:19:18,895 --> 01:19:20,361
who may not want to be there,

1875
01:19:20,395 --> 01:19:22,998
who can't be anything other
than peaceful and loving,

1876
01:19:23,032 --> 01:19:25,233
that's more of a
dystopia, isn't it?

1877
01:19:25,266 --> 01:19:26,869
How do you mean?

1878
01:19:26,902 --> 01:19:28,369
Which feels more real?

1879
01:19:28,403 --> 01:19:31,472
A mindless automaton who
is programmed to love you

1880
01:19:31,506 --> 01:19:33,008
or truly falling in
love with someone

1881
01:19:33,042 --> 01:19:35,510
as they genuinely
fall in love with you?

1882
01:19:36,644 --> 01:19:40,015
[chuckling] So that's
what this is about?

1883
01:19:40,049 --> 01:19:41,382
You want people to love you?

1884
01:19:41,416 --> 01:19:42,750
Yes.

1885
01:19:42,784 --> 01:19:46,386
And true love is
voluntary, not compulsory.

1886
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:47,721
There has to be a
better way to have people

1887
01:19:47,754 --> 01:19:50,123
fall in love other than
throwing them into evil.

1888
01:19:50,157 --> 01:19:50,992
Is there?

1889
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:53,861
I'm quite literally the
source of all things

1890
01:19:53,895 --> 01:19:56,530
you hold as good, all of it.

1891
01:19:56,563 --> 01:19:58,732
You're made in my image, yes?

1892
01:19:58,765 --> 01:20:00,601
So you're naturally inclined
to find joy and peace

1893
01:20:00,634 --> 01:20:02,235
in things like,

1894
01:20:02,269 --> 01:20:05,639
well, for starters,
joy and peace.

1895
01:20:07,107 --> 01:20:09,408
But I'm not looking for people
with Stockholm syndrome here.

1896
01:20:09,442 --> 01:20:11,310
If someone is going
to meaningfully choose

1897
01:20:11,344 --> 01:20:12,980
to spend their eternity with me,

1898
01:20:14,246 --> 01:20:15,983
they need to know what
the other option is.

1899
01:20:16,016 --> 01:20:18,351
And what is the
opposite of love?

1900
01:20:18,384 --> 01:20:19,518
Hatred.

1901
01:20:19,552 --> 01:20:20,353
Sure.

1902
01:20:21,387 --> 01:20:24,057
And the opposite
of joy, despair.

1903
01:20:24,091 --> 01:20:25,691
The opposite of all that is good

1904
01:20:26,860 --> 01:20:28,594
is all that is evil.

1905
01:20:30,129 --> 01:20:31,964
So I create my own adversary.

1906
01:20:33,298 --> 01:20:37,535
The physical personified
embodiment of all that I am not.

1907
01:20:40,672 --> 01:20:41,740
The devil.

1908
01:20:43,174 --> 01:20:44,643
If it helps you to think
of him that way, sure.

1909
01:20:44,676 --> 01:20:46,444
There's an actual devil?

1910
01:20:46,478 --> 01:20:48,981
Like a literal Satan?

1911
01:20:49,015 --> 01:20:50,515
The way you're imagining him

1912
01:20:50,548 --> 01:20:52,018
elevates him to a certain
status that he's never had.

1913
01:20:52,051 --> 01:20:54,185
He's less of some all
powerful enemy of humanity

1914
01:20:54,219 --> 01:20:58,589
and more of a really
strong perspective.

1915
01:20:58,622 --> 01:21:00,791
He's an existential
enemy more than anything.

1916
01:21:00,825 --> 01:21:02,259
Isn't he the one responsible

1917
01:21:02,292 --> 01:21:03,661
for all the awful shit
that happens in the world?

1918
01:21:03,694 --> 01:21:04,695
No.

1919
01:21:04,728 --> 01:21:05,562
You are.

1920
01:21:07,398 --> 01:21:10,567
That's a royal you there.

1921
01:21:10,601 --> 01:21:12,336
I'm whispering into
all of your ears.

1922
01:21:12,369 --> 01:21:13,771
And so as is The Adversary.

1923
01:21:13,805 --> 01:21:15,205
You make a choice of
which of those suggestions

1924
01:21:15,239 --> 01:21:16,908
align with your soul.

1925
01:21:16,941 --> 01:21:17,976
You're free to do so.

1926
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:20,777
And having given you
that freedom on purpose,

1927
01:21:20,811 --> 01:21:23,446
I will respect the
choice you make with it.

1928
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:28,052
You respect us so much
that you burn us in hell

1929
01:21:28,085 --> 01:21:30,453
when we make the wrong choice?

1930
01:21:30,486 --> 01:21:31,955
There has to be a better way.

1931
01:21:33,991 --> 01:21:35,591
Okay, here.

1932
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:37,360
Let's say you're God, hmm?

1933
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,864
What'd you do differently?

1934
01:21:40,898 --> 01:21:42,198
Easy.

1935
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:43,866
Everybody goes to heaven.

1936
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:44,700
Wow, everybody?

1937
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,301
That's a bold move.

1938
01:21:46,334 --> 01:21:48,670
Some might accuse you
of eternal kidnapping.

1939
01:21:49,839 --> 01:21:51,841
Who wouldn't want
to go to heaven?

1940
01:21:51,874 --> 01:21:53,742
You've met people
who enjoy conflict.

1941
01:21:53,775 --> 01:21:55,111
Selfish people, violent people,

1942
01:21:55,144 --> 01:21:57,080
you think they're gonna
start singing kumbaya

1943
01:21:57,113 --> 01:21:58,081
because they're in paradise?

1944
01:21:58,114 --> 01:21:59,681
I don't know, maybe.

1945
01:21:59,715 --> 01:22:00,716
What if they don't?

1946
01:22:02,317 --> 01:22:04,252
Wouldn't they just turn
heaven back into earth,

1947
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:06,688
good folks and bad folk
suffering together?

1948
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:08,990
Okay, well, I would
give everyone a chance

1949
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:10,859
and then kick them out if
they screwed up too much.

1950
01:22:10,892 --> 01:22:14,395
But in the meantime, they
can muck around in heaven.

1951
01:22:14,428 --> 01:22:16,664
Wouldn't that diminish paradise

1952
01:22:16,697 --> 01:22:18,632
for the good people
trying to enjoy it?

1953
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:23,704
Can you see why you would
need a screening process,

1954
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:27,008
perhaps a lifetime
to allow people

1955
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:28,476
to sort themselves
into or out of it?

1956
01:22:28,509 --> 01:22:30,846
So that's what life is?

1957
01:22:30,879 --> 01:22:32,079
A screening process?

1958
01:22:33,246 --> 01:22:34,514
[The Lord] You can
think of it that way.

1959
01:22:34,547 --> 01:22:35,916
Okay, fine.

1960
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:40,020
So a lifetime to
weed out the Hitlers

1961
01:22:40,054 --> 01:22:42,823
and the Jeffrey Dahmer's
I get that, but...

1962
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:44,825
I mean I wouldn't do
this to people like me.

1963
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:46,861
I'm a pretty good
person, generally.

1964
01:22:47,862 --> 01:22:48,695
Aren't I?

1965
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:53,167
Depends on who you're
comparing yourself against.

1966
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,136
Against Hitler or
Jeffrey Dahmer, sure.

1967
01:22:55,168 --> 01:22:58,370
But compared to my goodness,

1968
01:22:58,403 --> 01:23:01,507
compared to the goodness of
paradise, are you perfect?

1969
01:23:02,708 --> 01:23:04,777
If I told you you
had to earn heaven

1970
01:23:04,811 --> 01:23:07,213
how confident are you that
you actually deserve it?

1971
01:23:07,247 --> 01:23:08,181
[Gabby] Who can answer that?

1972
01:23:08,214 --> 01:23:09,048
I can.

1973
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:11,750
And if you're saying
that you don't know

1974
01:23:11,784 --> 01:23:13,585
aren't you really telling
me that you can't be sure?

1975
01:23:13,619 --> 01:23:16,421
That you may have done some
things to void your ticket?

1976
01:23:16,455 --> 01:23:17,857
Okay, yeah.

1977
01:23:17,891 --> 01:23:19,590
But it's not like my worst
moments are all that I've done.

1978
01:23:19,624 --> 01:23:21,260
I've been the good
Samaritan too.

1979
01:23:21,292 --> 01:23:22,493
Yeah, but take out
all the good you've done

1980
01:23:22,527 --> 01:23:23,327
out of obligation,

1981
01:23:23,361 --> 01:23:24,797
wanting people to like you,

1982
01:23:24,830 --> 01:23:26,932
wanting to like yourself,

1983
01:23:26,965 --> 01:23:29,534
hoping for some sort of
reciprocation or reward.

1984
01:23:30,735 --> 01:23:32,370
How many moments
of genuine altruism

1985
01:23:32,403 --> 01:23:33,571
do you think you've
had in your life?

1986
01:23:33,604 --> 01:23:35,773
I don't know, dude,
but it isn't zero.

1987
01:23:37,542 --> 01:23:38,342
Is it?

1988
01:23:38,376 --> 01:23:39,845
No.

1989
01:23:39,878 --> 01:23:43,081
There've been some. [chuckling]

1990
01:23:43,114 --> 01:23:44,614
Then those should count.

1991
01:23:44,648 --> 01:23:46,349
If I'm the judge, then those
moments count for something.

1992
01:23:46,383 --> 01:23:48,518
Yeah, that'd be a strange
courtroom though, wouldn't it?

1993
01:23:48,552 --> 01:23:50,620
Would you offer John Wayne
Gacy a pardon for the murders

1994
01:23:50,654 --> 01:23:54,192
just because he brought joy
to children as a party clown?

1995
01:23:54,225 --> 01:23:55,392
[Gabby] No.

1996
01:23:55,425 --> 01:23:57,427
See, when you have
to pass judgment

1997
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:59,831
on the evil someone's done,

1998
01:23:59,864 --> 01:24:01,631
the good they've
done is irrelevant.

1999
01:24:01,665 --> 01:24:02,566
Just seems cruel.

2000
01:24:02,599 --> 01:24:03,633
I'll tell you what.

2001
01:24:04,734 --> 01:24:07,636
If you got a better
idea, tell me.

2002
01:24:08,972 --> 01:24:10,773
What about karma?

2003
01:24:10,807 --> 01:24:11,707
So simple.

2004
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:12,943
Why didn't I think of that?

2005
01:24:12,976 --> 01:24:14,177
What is that, like
a point system?

2006
01:24:14,211 --> 01:24:15,477
[Gabby] Why not?

2007
01:24:15,511 --> 01:24:17,013
You tell me.

2008
01:24:17,047 --> 01:24:18,414
What do you tell the person
who is one point away

2009
01:24:18,447 --> 01:24:19,883
from getting into heaven?

2010
01:24:19,916 --> 01:24:22,085
I'm so sorry, Ms. Fillmore.

2011
01:24:22,118 --> 01:24:23,485
If you did just picked
up your neighbor's kids

2012
01:24:23,519 --> 01:24:25,088
from soccer practice
one more time.

2013
01:24:25,121 --> 01:24:26,990
Well, eternal
damnation for you then.

2014
01:24:27,924 --> 01:24:29,358
Is that more fair?

2015
01:24:29,391 --> 01:24:30,894
I would make an exception.

2016
01:24:32,094 --> 01:24:34,163
What about the people
who are two points off?

2017
01:24:34,196 --> 01:24:35,030
Three?

2018
01:24:35,931 --> 01:24:36,999
We back to everybody gets in?

2019
01:24:37,032 --> 01:24:38,533
Okay, fine.

2020
01:24:38,566 --> 01:24:39,767
It's a firm line.

2021
01:24:39,802 --> 01:24:41,303
I get it, God has to
make tough decisions.

2022
01:24:41,337 --> 01:24:43,339
But fair is fair and
one point is one point.

2023
01:24:43,371 --> 01:24:46,574
Wow, that's very
bureaucratic of you.

2024
01:24:46,608 --> 01:24:47,877
Critics might call
you legalistic.

2025
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:51,213
So now, what about the
guy who's done good

2026
01:24:51,247 --> 01:24:53,082
his entire life, right?

2027
01:24:53,115 --> 01:24:54,616
But molested a child
a couple of times.

2028
01:24:54,649 --> 01:24:55,984
I'm sure his karma score
would be pretty high.

2029
01:24:56,017 --> 01:24:57,218
You let him in?

2030
01:24:57,252 --> 01:24:58,619
Maybe especially
bad crimes have

2031
01:24:58,652 --> 01:25:01,455
a one strike and
you're out rule.

2032
01:25:01,488 --> 01:25:03,024
That's an idea, there you go.

2033
01:25:04,325 --> 01:25:06,261
What are these especially
bad crimes then?

2034
01:25:07,594 --> 01:25:10,430
You know, cold
blooded murder, rape.

2035
01:25:12,432 --> 01:25:13,600
Why those?

2036
01:25:13,634 --> 01:25:15,669
Because they make
you a bad human.

2037
01:25:15,702 --> 01:25:17,138
They destroy people.

2038
01:25:17,171 --> 01:25:18,572
Yeah but what about liars
and bullies and thieves?

2039
01:25:18,605 --> 01:25:19,538
Don't they hurt people?

2040
01:25:19,572 --> 01:25:21,308
They destroy people too, right?

2041
01:25:21,341 --> 01:25:23,343
I mean, yeah, but if you
did away with the murders

2042
01:25:23,377 --> 01:25:25,245
and the rapists, then
that's a good start, right?

2043
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:26,479
Good start, yeah.

2044
01:25:26,512 --> 01:25:30,716
But an eternal paradise
is finished, isn't it?

2045
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:31,985
When you imagine
yourself in a place

2046
01:25:32,019 --> 01:25:33,987
where you can have
your stuff stolen,

2047
01:25:34,021 --> 01:25:35,389
where you can't take
people at their word,

2048
01:25:35,421 --> 01:25:38,358
where you can be made
to feel bad or inferior,

2049
01:25:39,525 --> 01:25:41,929
are you imagining
yourself in heaven?

2050
01:25:41,962 --> 01:25:43,162
[Gabby] No.

2051
01:25:43,195 --> 01:25:44,096
There's the rub.

2052
01:25:45,231 --> 01:25:48,367
We want an eternal place
of perfect goodness.

2053
01:25:48,401 --> 01:25:51,770
Any bit of evil destroys
what we're working towards.

2054
01:25:51,804 --> 01:25:53,873
But that would mean
that telling a lie

2055
01:25:53,906 --> 01:25:55,473
and murder are equal.

2056
01:25:55,507 --> 01:25:56,741
I never said they were equal.

2057
01:25:56,775 --> 01:25:58,411
Think about a deck of cards.

2058
01:25:58,443 --> 01:26:00,880
Would did anybody say that a
King and a three are equal?

2059
01:26:00,913 --> 01:26:02,647
[Gabby] Of course not.

2060
01:26:02,681 --> 01:26:05,450
What happens if we
build a house of cards?

2061
01:26:05,483 --> 01:26:07,118
Any card removed from
that delicate tower

2062
01:26:07,152 --> 01:26:08,320
and it'll collapse.

2063
01:26:08,353 --> 01:26:10,388
It doesn't matter if
it's a King or a three.

2064
01:26:10,422 --> 01:26:11,856
This is just making
it sound impossible

2065
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:13,624
to judge a person's
moral choices fairly.

2066
01:26:13,657 --> 01:26:15,260
Oh, it's possible.

2067
01:26:15,293 --> 01:26:17,896
It's just really bleak.

2068
01:26:17,929 --> 01:26:21,199
If I judged you all fairly,
no one would get in.

2069
01:26:21,232 --> 01:26:22,466
I'd be alone in paradise.

2070
01:26:22,499 --> 01:26:24,768
I may as well have
not created anything.

2071
01:26:24,803 --> 01:26:26,104
Trust me.

2072
01:26:26,137 --> 01:26:27,538
You don't want my fairness.

2073
01:26:29,808 --> 01:26:31,275
You want my mercy.

2074
01:26:35,813 --> 01:26:39,482
You said that life was
a screening process, yeah?

2075
01:26:39,515 --> 01:26:40,451
A test?

2076
01:26:40,483 --> 01:26:41,784
Mhmm, I did.

2077
01:26:41,819 --> 01:26:45,122
So then what's the
point if everyone fails?

2078
01:26:45,990 --> 01:26:47,724
What are you doing here?

2079
01:26:47,757 --> 01:26:49,793
If everyone is on
an equal playing field

2080
01:26:49,827 --> 01:26:53,831
of moral disqualification,
then maybe, maybe.

2081
01:26:53,864 --> 01:26:55,764
That's not the most
important part of deciding

2082
01:26:55,798 --> 01:26:57,200
who can get along in heaven.

2083
01:27:03,373 --> 01:27:04,740
It's not a moral test.

2084
01:27:04,773 --> 01:27:06,275
[chuckling] Bingo.

2085
01:27:07,944 --> 01:27:09,745
Okay, well then

2086
01:27:09,778 --> 01:27:11,447
what about all the people
who spend their lives

2087
01:27:11,481 --> 01:27:12,815
trying to be good?

2088
01:27:12,849 --> 01:27:14,083
It just doesn't matter.

2089
01:27:14,117 --> 01:27:16,752
Practically speaking,
it matters a great deal.

2090
01:27:16,785 --> 01:27:18,754
It makes the world
a better place.

2091
01:27:18,788 --> 01:27:21,522
But nobody chooses to be
that way 100% of the time

2092
01:27:21,555 --> 01:27:22,757
or for the right motives.

2093
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:24,159
At least not in a way
that could allow someone

2094
01:27:24,192 --> 01:27:26,428
to earn heaven.

2095
01:27:27,496 --> 01:27:28,596
Even little things,

2096
01:27:29,998 --> 01:27:33,301
like hiding a smoking habit
come from a heart that deceives.

2097
01:27:33,335 --> 01:27:34,602
Wait, you know I smoke?

2098
01:27:35,669 --> 01:27:37,472
Does Michael know I smoke?

2099
01:27:37,506 --> 01:27:38,306
Nope.

2100
01:27:39,941 --> 01:27:41,810
Then why didn't
you just start there,

2101
01:27:41,843 --> 01:27:43,277
if you wanted me to believe
you this whole time?

2102
01:27:43,310 --> 01:27:45,813
You would have assumed Michael
smelled it on your clothes.

2103
01:27:45,846 --> 01:27:48,315
You trust me or doubt me first.

2104
01:27:49,517 --> 01:27:50,784
Then you block out
what doesn't fit.

2105
01:27:50,818 --> 01:27:52,253
That seems so petty, though.

2106
01:27:52,286 --> 01:27:54,654
I mean, I'm damned because
I'm not vocal about my vices?

2107
01:27:54,687 --> 01:27:56,290
That's just one small fruit

2108
01:27:56,323 --> 01:27:59,493
that grows in a heart
composed of evil soil.

2109
01:27:59,527 --> 01:28:00,861
One that serves itself,

2110
01:28:00,895 --> 01:28:05,032
not one that loves and
trusts others first.

2111
01:28:05,066 --> 01:28:06,566
I see what you would do

2112
01:28:06,599 --> 01:28:09,668
if this societal shackles of
law and order were let loose

2113
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:12,238
and you could do anything
that you desired.

2114
01:28:12,272 --> 01:28:16,009
It's in everyone to some degree.

2115
01:28:16,042 --> 01:28:17,243
It doesn't really bode well

2116
01:28:17,277 --> 01:28:19,179
for what you would
do in paradise.

2117
01:28:19,212 --> 01:28:22,949
I need people that will
retain perfection voluntarily.

2118
01:28:24,918 --> 01:28:28,021
It's a blessing that
this isn't a moral test.

2119
01:28:29,422 --> 01:28:30,790
You let terrible evil
things happen to us,

2120
01:28:30,823 --> 01:28:32,991
and then you just take the ones

2121
01:28:33,025 --> 01:28:35,060
who suck up to you
into heaven, hmm?

2122
01:28:35,094 --> 01:28:36,495
[The Lord] Hmm.

2123
01:28:36,528 --> 01:28:37,728
That's some Job shit.

2124
01:28:39,098 --> 01:28:43,502
If anything, you're
all like Adam and Eve.

2125
01:28:44,369 --> 01:28:45,838
You remember them, don't you?

2126
01:28:45,871 --> 01:28:48,974
You damned all of humanity
because they ate an apple.

2127
01:28:49,007 --> 01:28:51,443
That's not exactly the
point of that illustration.

2128
01:28:51,477 --> 01:28:53,445
Do you have any more ideas on
how to restructure my universe

2129
01:28:53,479 --> 01:28:55,480
or you got time
for a quick story?

2130
01:28:57,081 --> 01:28:58,449
Go ahead.

2131
01:29:03,753 --> 01:29:05,156
I'm playing the long game.

2132
01:29:08,226 --> 01:29:10,461
In the beginning, I gave
humanity a prototype

2133
01:29:10,495 --> 01:29:11,529
for the paradise
that I'm building.

2134
01:29:11,562 --> 01:29:13,131
A world separate from mine,

2135
01:29:13,164 --> 01:29:14,932
where they could
do as they pleased

2136
01:29:14,966 --> 01:29:17,802
without destroying heaven.

2137
01:29:17,835 --> 01:29:19,735
So the question on the table is

2138
01:29:19,768 --> 01:29:21,071
how do I sort out those

2139
01:29:21,104 --> 01:29:23,607
who can get along
peacefully in heaven?

2140
01:29:23,639 --> 01:29:26,276
I gave them the bare
minimum required for a test.

2141
01:29:26,309 --> 01:29:28,512
Something they weren't
permitted to do,

2142
01:29:28,545 --> 01:29:29,813
but the freedom to do it.

2143
01:29:31,014 --> 01:29:32,382
The story you're familiar with,

2144
01:29:32,415 --> 01:29:34,650
the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil.

2145
01:29:34,683 --> 01:29:37,554
I set things up so that
eating from the tree

2146
01:29:37,587 --> 01:29:40,557
would allow humanity
to behave imperfectly.

2147
01:29:44,393 --> 01:29:47,062
It gave the choice
if a person chose it

2148
01:29:48,597 --> 01:29:50,665
to commit evil.

2149
01:29:50,698 --> 01:29:53,169
I explained to them
in no uncertain terms

2150
01:29:53,202 --> 01:29:54,970
that eating from the tree

2151
01:29:55,004 --> 01:29:58,607
would bring only
suffering, only death.

2152
01:29:58,641 --> 01:29:59,608
It wasn't a moral test,

2153
01:29:59,642 --> 01:30:01,776
since, well eating from the tree

2154
01:30:01,810 --> 01:30:03,279
would have awakened the capacity

2155
01:30:03,312 --> 01:30:05,247
for there to be morality
in the first place anyway.

2156
01:30:05,281 --> 01:30:08,715
It was a test of whether or
not my people trusted me.

2157
01:30:09,784 --> 01:30:11,819
[cork popping]

2158
01:30:11,853 --> 01:30:13,521
It could have been anything.

2159
01:30:13,555 --> 01:30:14,556
The point was,

2160
01:30:15,823 --> 01:30:18,426
if they trusted
me and no one ate,

2161
01:30:19,294 --> 01:30:21,296
no evil would enter the world.

2162
01:30:21,329 --> 01:30:22,163
No suffering.

2163
01:30:23,364 --> 01:30:24,765
Trust isn't trust
unless it is given

2164
01:30:24,799 --> 01:30:26,401
in spite of a reason to doubt.

2165
01:30:26,434 --> 01:30:29,037
So I gave The Adversary
a voice in the garden.

2166
01:30:30,605 --> 01:30:32,940
He told them I could be lying.

2167
01:30:32,973 --> 01:30:35,809
He said seek certainty
over trusting my word.

2168
01:30:37,477 --> 01:30:38,912
And that's what they did.

2169
01:30:38,946 --> 01:30:40,180
You'd hope it wouldn't
be the first people.

2170
01:30:40,214 --> 01:30:41,882
You know, maybe we get
a few generations in

2171
01:30:41,915 --> 01:30:43,383
before it all falls apart, but

2172
01:30:44,451 --> 01:30:47,354
right away, the cards collapsed.

2173
01:30:48,555 --> 01:30:51,191
And as a result, all
of their descendants,

2174
01:30:52,826 --> 01:30:53,627
you...

2175
01:30:54,927 --> 01:30:57,630
are imperfect and broken.

2176
01:30:59,999 --> 01:31:01,133
You can have paradise
back tomorrow

2177
01:31:01,167 --> 01:31:02,335
if you all collectively chose it

2178
01:31:02,368 --> 01:31:05,271
but there are none
among you who truly do.

2179
01:31:07,073 --> 01:31:08,773
You can all choose evil.

2180
01:31:09,875 --> 01:31:11,110
Hmm.

2181
01:31:11,143 --> 01:31:12,812
And at some point you
at least dip your toes

2182
01:31:12,845 --> 01:31:13,745
into its waters.

2183
01:31:15,147 --> 01:31:17,650
So what's left is this system

2184
01:31:17,683 --> 01:31:19,017
where you're faced
with the same decision

2185
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:20,885
that the first people once had.

2186
01:31:21,853 --> 01:31:23,388
Do you trust the voice of faith

2187
01:31:26,491 --> 01:31:27,692
or the voice of doubt?

2188
01:31:27,726 --> 01:31:29,561
It still doesn't seem fair.

2189
01:31:29,594 --> 01:31:31,496
I mean, Adam and Eve
didn't have to guess

2190
01:31:31,529 --> 01:31:33,798
whether or not you even existed.

2191
01:31:33,832 --> 01:31:35,967
It clearly didn't
help, did it?

2192
01:31:36,001 --> 01:31:37,302
They still ate.

2193
01:31:37,335 --> 01:31:38,536
The test remains the same,

2194
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:40,672
as long as there are
equal voices of trust

2195
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:42,973
and doubt.

2196
01:31:46,277 --> 01:31:47,077
Okay.

2197
01:31:50,414 --> 01:31:51,348
I'll bite.

2198
01:31:51,382 --> 01:31:52,349
Unfortunate choice of words.

2199
01:31:52,383 --> 01:31:53,484
I meant figuratively.

2200
01:31:53,517 --> 01:31:54,985
Ah, carry on then.

2201
01:31:56,453 --> 01:32:00,724
So you take the ones who
trust you into paradise.

2202
01:32:00,758 --> 01:32:01,458
Yup.

2203
01:32:01,492 --> 01:32:02,793
I get that.

2204
01:32:02,826 --> 01:32:04,795
But if we're all evil anyway

2205
01:32:04,828 --> 01:32:06,563
how come we don't just
fuck heaven right back up

2206
01:32:06,596 --> 01:32:08,097
once we get there?

2207
01:32:08,131 --> 01:32:10,867
I restore your shattered
perfection after you die.

2208
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:13,036
I give you the same choice
the first people once had,

2209
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:16,873
to choose to be perfect.

2210
01:32:16,906 --> 01:32:18,741
By making up heaven of
those people who trust me

2211
01:32:18,776 --> 01:32:22,645
I've decided for the ones who
wouldn't eat from the tree.

2212
01:32:24,147 --> 01:32:26,516
People who will keep within
the boundaries of goodness

2213
01:32:26,549 --> 01:32:28,786
that I've set because,

2214
01:32:28,818 --> 01:32:30,086
well, because they
trust me when I say

2215
01:32:30,119 --> 01:32:32,621
certain things will
only unleash suffering.

2216
01:32:34,122 --> 01:32:37,025
The rules aren't just there
so I can exert my authority.

2217
01:32:38,927 --> 01:32:40,028
Okay, fine.

2218
01:32:40,062 --> 01:32:44,166
So you get your perfect
kingdom one day.

2219
01:32:46,168 --> 01:32:47,869
But in the meantime it's pain.

2220
01:32:49,171 --> 01:32:51,306
You make us look into
the face of evil.

2221
01:32:52,374 --> 01:32:55,609
You watch us starve,

2222
01:32:55,643 --> 01:32:59,080
and contract disease,
die violent deaths.

2223
01:33:00,247 --> 01:33:02,016
And yet you continue
to put us here.

2224
01:33:03,484 --> 01:33:04,719
And then at the end of it

2225
01:33:04,752 --> 01:33:06,087
not even everyone
gets into heaven.

2226
01:33:07,455 --> 01:33:12,326
So no matter your reasoning,
you gave us suffering.

2227
01:33:13,494 --> 01:33:14,695
How does that not
make you a monster?

2228
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:17,598
If your child has leukemia,

2229
01:33:18,998 --> 01:33:21,968
are you a monster for putting
them through chemotherapy?

2230
01:33:22,001 --> 01:33:22,837
Is the doctor?

2231
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,173
No.

2232
01:33:27,207 --> 01:33:29,042
What if there isn't
a 100% success rate

2233
01:33:29,075 --> 01:33:30,577
in healing them?

2234
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:31,745
Then are they monsters?

2235
01:33:34,114 --> 01:33:35,515
No.

2236
01:33:35,548 --> 01:33:38,051
So sometimes, sometimes,

2237
01:33:39,452 --> 01:33:42,654
is suffering necessary to get
from unhealthy to healthy?

2238
01:33:42,688 --> 01:33:44,256
Do you sometimes have
to subject yourself

2239
01:33:44,289 --> 01:33:47,326
or someone that you love
to temporary suffering

2240
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:49,561
maybe only on the
hope of a chance

2241
01:33:49,595 --> 01:33:50,929
at a long-term benefit?

2242
01:33:52,464 --> 01:33:53,298
Maybe.

2243
01:33:55,267 --> 01:33:56,068
Yeah.

2244
01:33:56,101 --> 01:33:56,935
Mhmm.

2245
01:33:58,170 --> 01:33:59,806
Okay, but then

2246
01:33:59,839 --> 01:34:02,608
what about things
like earthquakes

2247
01:34:02,641 --> 01:34:04,811
and wildfires and hurricanes?

2248
01:34:05,944 --> 01:34:07,979
You're going to pin
that on human morality?

2249
01:34:09,113 --> 01:34:10,014
Are you grieving
that the world

2250
01:34:10,047 --> 01:34:11,349
isn't as it's supposed to be?

2251
01:34:12,283 --> 01:34:13,117
Me too.

2252
01:34:14,419 --> 01:34:17,588
We both know that
perfection is the standard.

2253
01:34:17,622 --> 01:34:19,957
We're offended when that's
violated, aren't we?

2254
01:34:22,326 --> 01:34:24,595
When humanity decided to
cut itself off from me,

2255
01:34:24,629 --> 01:34:26,865
I stopped micromanaging
your world.

2256
01:34:26,899 --> 01:34:28,533
Without my divine nature,

2257
01:34:30,401 --> 01:34:32,002
natural processes can do damage.

2258
01:34:33,203 --> 01:34:34,806
Can't always be 72
degrees and sunny.

2259
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:39,709
A pot abandoned on the
stove will boil over.

2260
01:34:40,845 --> 01:34:42,479
The echoes of shattered
perfection are loud,

2261
01:34:42,512 --> 01:34:45,148
but you can only grieve
for a rod bent out of shape

2262
01:34:45,182 --> 01:34:47,885
if somewhere in you, you
know it ought to be straight.

2263
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:51,955
We can talk about
this all night.

2264
01:34:53,290 --> 01:34:54,623
We can talk about
everything that I've done,

2265
01:34:54,657 --> 01:34:55,926
am doing, and will do.

2266
01:34:55,991 --> 01:34:57,660
You can analyze
it tirelessly, but

2267
01:34:59,028 --> 01:35:00,996
that would be making a decision
based upon your judgment.

2268
01:35:01,030 --> 01:35:02,498
And in all honesty,

2269
01:35:02,531 --> 01:35:05,668
I'm not worried about what
your judgment call is here.

2270
01:35:05,701 --> 01:35:08,204
You don't really have the
perspective to make one.

2271
01:35:10,072 --> 01:35:11,307
What I'm wondering is,

2272
01:35:12,308 --> 01:35:14,143
do you trust me?

2273
01:35:15,377 --> 01:35:16,378
How can I?

2274
01:35:17,814 --> 01:35:20,883
How can I trust a person and
a plan with so much darkness?

2275
01:35:20,916 --> 01:35:22,083
The same way that
a mother trusts

2276
01:35:22,116 --> 01:35:23,751
that the pain of childbirth

2277
01:35:23,786 --> 01:35:26,120
is worth the bringing
in of new life.

2278
01:35:26,154 --> 01:35:28,723
I cannot build this
without labor pains.

2279
01:35:28,756 --> 01:35:31,092
But I've determined that this
is the best possible scenario

2280
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:34,195
to craft the best
possible reality.

2281
01:35:34,229 --> 01:35:37,098
Okay but why does the
best possible reality

2282
01:35:37,131 --> 01:35:38,500
have to have a hell in it?

2283
01:35:40,903 --> 01:35:41,937
Yours wouldn't huh?

2284
01:35:41,971 --> 01:35:42,804
No.

2285
01:35:43,972 --> 01:35:45,405
I couldn't torture
people for eternity

2286
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:47,775
and then feel like I had
the moral high ground.

2287
01:35:49,811 --> 01:35:52,679
I am the source
of all that is good.

2288
01:35:52,713 --> 01:35:54,715
When someone decides
they don't want me,

2289
01:35:56,049 --> 01:35:58,018
I give their eternal soul

2290
01:35:58,051 --> 01:36:00,487
its own place after
death without me

2291
01:36:00,521 --> 01:36:01,421
as they've desired.

2292
01:36:02,891 --> 01:36:06,459
What do you think a place
devoid of all goodness is like?

2293
01:36:06,492 --> 01:36:07,326
Torture.

2294
01:36:11,932 --> 01:36:13,199
Hell.

2295
01:36:13,232 --> 01:36:14,066
Exactly.

2296
01:36:15,735 --> 01:36:18,337
I didn't make hell
to torture people in.

2297
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:23,109
People become hell.

2298
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:27,647
And I give them their own
domain separate from heaven.

2299
01:36:29,715 --> 01:36:31,483
They reject the antidote
for the suffering

2300
01:36:31,516 --> 01:36:32,684
in their own heart

2301
01:36:32,717 --> 01:36:34,219
and choose to live
in that for eternity.

2302
01:36:36,187 --> 01:36:38,690
I don't torture people in hell.

2303
01:36:38,723 --> 01:36:40,993
You don't blame a warm fire
for the coldness of the people

2304
01:36:41,027 --> 01:36:42,627
who choose not to sit beside it.

2305
01:36:45,630 --> 01:36:47,299
I'm trying to process this.

2306
01:36:47,332 --> 01:36:48,633
It's a hell of a lot to take in.

2307
01:36:48,667 --> 01:36:51,403
I'd advise you not
to take your time.

2308
01:36:51,436 --> 01:36:53,138
Tomorrow only grows closer.

2309
01:36:54,338 --> 01:36:55,840
Yeah, okay.

2310
01:36:55,874 --> 01:36:59,510
It's just a lot of pressure.

2311
01:36:59,543 --> 01:37:02,981
I need to wrap my brain
around everything.

2312
01:37:05,082 --> 01:37:05,917
Gabrielle.

2313
01:37:07,084 --> 01:37:11,288
Do you trust with your
brain or your heart?

2314
01:37:11,322 --> 01:37:13,591
[gentle music]

2315
01:37:13,624 --> 01:37:15,060
If you'd grasp that,

2316
01:37:15,092 --> 01:37:16,928
maybe your clock wouldn't
be ticking so loudly.

2317
01:37:38,514 --> 01:37:41,217
I love you, Gabrielle.

2318
01:37:58,101 --> 01:37:58,935
Hmm?

2319
01:38:00,435 --> 01:38:01,236
I know, I just,

2320
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:03,705
I think that I do.

2321
01:38:03,739 --> 01:38:05,875
It's just a lot
for me to say it.

2322
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:08,844
Huh?

2323
01:38:09,811 --> 01:38:11,245
What do you mean?

2324
01:38:12,814 --> 01:38:13,915
What do you mean?

2325
01:38:13,949 --> 01:38:16,617
I asked if you like the wine.

2326
01:38:16,651 --> 01:38:17,886
You did?

2327
01:38:17,919 --> 01:38:19,553
Yeah.

2328
01:38:19,587 --> 01:38:22,223
Oh right, yeah, you did.

2329
01:38:22,256 --> 01:38:24,358
Yeah, I do like it.

2330
01:38:24,392 --> 01:38:26,694
Why was it so hard for
you to say, goofball?

2331
01:38:30,296 --> 01:38:31,665
No.

2332
01:38:31,698 --> 01:38:33,801
No, no!

2333
01:38:33,834 --> 01:38:34,802
Okay.

2334
01:38:34,835 --> 01:38:35,735
Tell me it didn't happen again.

2335
01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:36,536
It didn't happen again, right?

2336
01:38:36,569 --> 01:38:37,772
[Gabby] He was here.

2337
01:38:37,805 --> 01:38:38,839
Gabby, Gabby, we
have to go then.

2338
01:38:38,873 --> 01:38:39,940
- No, no, no.
- Help me clean up.

2339
01:38:39,974 --> 01:38:40,875
- I'll clean up,
- No, Michael.

2340
01:38:40,908 --> 01:38:41,809
- It's real,
- Pack the car

2341
01:38:41,842 --> 01:38:42,676
- and we'll leave.
- It's all real.

2342
01:38:42,709 --> 01:38:43,878
We had this long talk

2343
01:38:43,911 --> 01:38:44,812
and it's fascinating
and frightening.

2344
01:38:44,845 --> 01:38:45,745
I don't know if it's nothing

2345
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:46,847
- but I feel much better.
- It's not God

2346
01:38:46,881 --> 01:38:47,848
- that's talking to you.
- Yes it is.

2347
01:38:47,882 --> 01:38:48,615
He didn't leave.

2348
01:38:48,648 --> 01:38:49,482
I still have a chance,

2349
01:38:49,516 --> 01:38:50,483
- I still have a chance.
- Oh, stop it.

2350
01:38:50,517 --> 01:38:51,118
Stop it!

2351
01:38:51,152 --> 01:38:52,419
God exists.

2352
01:38:52,452 --> 01:38:53,520
There is an order, there's
this good out there

2353
01:38:53,553 --> 01:38:54,286
and all this bullshit-

2354
01:38:54,319 --> 01:38:55,155
- That may be, that may be

2355
01:38:55,187 --> 01:38:55,889
but God's not talking to you.

2356
01:38:55,922 --> 01:38:56,823
Yes he is.

2357
01:38:56,856 --> 01:38:57,924
I know you don't
believe it, but I think-

2358
01:38:57,957 --> 01:38:59,491
- Shut the hell up!

2359
01:38:59,525 --> 01:39:02,062
I'm trying to tell you
something, so listen to me, okay?

2360
01:39:02,962 --> 01:39:04,496
I haven't been honest with you.

2361
01:39:08,534 --> 01:39:10,469
I lied about my
deepest darkest secret.

2362
01:39:12,172 --> 01:39:13,639
I mean, the plane story happened

2363
01:39:13,672 --> 01:39:16,275
but I have a history of
mental illness in my family.

2364
01:39:17,143 --> 01:39:18,676
My dad had schizophrenia.

2365
01:39:19,845 --> 01:39:21,713
I showed some of the
early signs of it.

2366
01:39:21,746 --> 01:39:24,116
Delusions of grandeur,
disorganized thinking.

2367
01:39:25,316 --> 01:39:27,218
Junior year of
college, I dropped acid

2368
01:39:27,251 --> 01:39:28,854
and it all clicked for me.

2369
01:39:28,887 --> 01:39:31,389
I thought I was special
because I was God.

2370
01:39:32,323 --> 01:39:33,859
I had just somehow forgotten.

2371
01:39:33,892 --> 01:39:34,927
But now...

2372
01:39:36,394 --> 01:39:39,998
Now I remembered and slipped
back into this God persona.

2373
01:39:42,332 --> 01:39:45,602
It took months of
hospitalization and therapy

2374
01:39:45,635 --> 01:39:47,105
for me to get back in
touch with reality.

2375
01:39:47,138 --> 01:39:49,107
And I've always worried
that my grasp on it

2376
01:39:49,140 --> 01:39:52,309
was not as strong
as it once was.

2377
01:39:54,812 --> 01:39:55,980
That's what's happening here.

2378
01:39:56,013 --> 01:39:57,614
No, that can't be.

2379
01:39:57,647 --> 01:40:01,551
I'm telling you
this isn't real.

2380
01:40:01,585 --> 01:40:03,720
I could be consumed
by this persona.

2381
01:40:03,754 --> 01:40:06,823
And who knows if I can
come back this time?

2382
01:40:09,159 --> 01:40:12,929
I'm afraid, and
you should be too.

2383
01:40:12,963 --> 01:40:14,497
I'm not afraid anymore.

2384
01:40:14,530 --> 01:40:16,800
You, you don't know
what this is, I do.

2385
01:40:16,833 --> 01:40:18,769
And it's nothing like psychosis.

2386
01:40:18,802 --> 01:40:20,203
I have a history of it.

2387
01:40:20,237 --> 01:40:21,872
That's a coincidence.

2388
01:40:21,905 --> 01:40:23,539
Maybe it's my God chose you

2389
01:40:23,572 --> 01:40:24,740
- for this in the first place.
- Stop, stop.

2390
01:40:24,775 --> 01:40:26,109
Because your brain
was already open

2391
01:40:26,143 --> 01:40:27,811
- to speaking for him!
- Stop justifying my illness.

2392
01:40:27,844 --> 01:40:29,311
Okay, you're smarter than this.

2393
01:40:29,345 --> 01:40:31,847
Or maybe it's because you
really are God, Michael.

2394
01:40:31,881 --> 01:40:32,848
Maybe that's true.

2395
01:40:32,882 --> 01:40:34,150
Hearing you say that I'm God

2396
01:40:34,183 --> 01:40:36,018
is not what I need to
hear right now, okay?

2397
01:40:36,051 --> 01:40:38,353
You need to take me home.

2398
01:40:38,386 --> 01:40:40,823
Stop buying into this fantasy
and get me out of here.

2399
01:40:40,856 --> 01:40:42,390
God said that you
wouldn't understand.

2400
01:40:42,423 --> 01:40:43,625
He said that I would
have to tell you,

2401
01:40:43,658 --> 01:40:44,760
but he's really
here, I promise you.

2402
01:40:44,794 --> 01:40:46,829
How are you this fucking dumb,

2403
01:40:46,862 --> 01:40:48,630
you dumb bitch?!

2404
01:40:48,663 --> 01:40:50,766
You're buying into the
ramblings of a madman!

2405
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:51,901
You understand that?

2406
01:40:54,235 --> 01:40:56,037
Pack your fucking bags,

2407
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:57,471
put them in the fucking car,

2408
01:40:57,504 --> 01:40:59,140
and drive me the fuck home!

2409
01:41:01,742 --> 01:41:03,178
I didn't know you were even
capable of speaking to me

2410
01:41:03,211 --> 01:41:04,212
- like that.
- Yeah and I thought

2411
01:41:04,245 --> 01:41:05,712
you were a reasonable person.

2412
01:41:07,248 --> 01:41:10,450
Instead, I'm learning
how selfish you are.

2413
01:41:10,484 --> 01:41:13,654
You're making my
breakdown about you!

2414
01:41:18,225 --> 01:41:20,928
I don't know what's happening
right now exactly, but

2415
01:41:22,229 --> 01:41:24,765
I do know that you're
at least Michael

2416
01:41:24,798 --> 01:41:26,099
right now in this moment,

2417
01:41:27,667 --> 01:41:29,169
and I am disgusted with you.

2418
01:41:30,469 --> 01:41:31,305
Good.

2419
01:41:32,405 --> 01:41:34,041
All the more reason to leave.

2420
01:41:34,074 --> 01:41:35,843
I have no interest in
sitting in a car with you

2421
01:41:35,876 --> 01:41:37,077
for six hours right now.

2422
01:41:38,644 --> 01:41:40,247
I'm sleeping downstairs tonight.

2423
01:41:41,414 --> 01:41:43,082
Clean the place, pack the car

2424
01:41:43,115 --> 01:41:45,184
and I'll take you
home in the morning.

[tense electronic music]

2426
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,722
Yeah, hi, is this Diane Hausman?

2427
01:44:11,291 --> 01:44:12,491
Right, of course.

2428
01:44:12,524 --> 01:44:13,994
This is Gabrielle Russell.

2429
01:44:16,162 --> 01:44:18,131
I'm actually dating your son.

2430
01:44:19,332 --> 01:44:20,800
No.

2431
01:44:20,834 --> 01:44:23,770
I know it's late, but it's
actually kind of urgent.

2432
01:44:23,803 --> 01:44:25,637
I wouldn't have
woken you otherwise.

2433
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:28,208
I think so.

2434
01:44:29,675 --> 01:44:31,110
I think so.

2435
01:44:31,143 --> 01:44:34,480
I just learned some parts
about Michael's past

2436
01:44:34,512 --> 01:44:37,383
and I was hoping you could
give me some more information.

2437
01:44:38,851 --> 01:44:41,519
Just like the stuff
with your family history

2438
01:44:41,552 --> 01:44:44,522
with schizophrenia and his
hospitalization a few years ago.

2439
01:44:46,925 --> 01:44:49,128
Michael's dad has
schizophrenia, doesn't he?

2440
01:44:53,365 --> 01:44:55,466
No, that's okay.

2441
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,201
I would assume you
knew if he did.

2442
01:44:59,636 --> 01:45:02,373
But Michael did have like a
breakdown in college, right?

2443
01:45:05,642 --> 01:45:07,111
It's not important.

2444
01:45:10,714 --> 01:45:12,250
Yeah.

2445
01:45:12,283 --> 01:45:14,519
Yeah, I guess that's
what must have happened.

2446
01:45:16,187 --> 01:45:17,055
One more thing.

2447
01:45:18,855 --> 01:45:19,923
Do you trust Michael?

2448
01:45:21,792 --> 01:45:24,928
No, I'm not asking if
you have a reason not to.

2449
01:45:24,961 --> 01:45:26,129
Do you trust him?

2450
01:45:29,099 --> 01:45:29,933
Yeah.

2451
01:45:30,867 --> 01:45:31,700
Definitely.

2452
01:45:32,803 --> 01:45:33,702
Good night.

01:46:23,518 --> 01:46:24,419
Oh m y god.

01:46:24,452 --> 01:46:26,354
I didn't know you smoked.

01:46:26,387 --> 01:46:27,789
Yeah well I guess we're
both learning something

2457
01:46:27,822 --> 01:46:29,591
on this trip, aren't we?

2458
01:46:29,623 --> 01:46:32,192
[Michael] What are you doing
sneaking around in my room?

2459
01:46:32,226 --> 01:46:33,560
I didn't have any of
my stuff downstairs.

2460
01:46:33,594 --> 01:46:35,095
I wanted a cigarette, sue me.

2461
01:46:35,129 --> 01:46:38,198
And where does my phone
factor into that exactly?

2462
01:46:38,232 --> 01:46:39,066
Yeah.

2463
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:42,136
Not as graceful as
you thought you were.

2464
01:46:42,169 --> 01:46:43,937
I called your mom, okay?

2465
01:46:43,971 --> 01:46:45,205
I know.

2466
01:46:45,239 --> 01:46:46,440
Know what?

2467
01:46:46,473 --> 01:46:48,041
That you're full of shit.

2468
01:46:48,075 --> 01:46:50,444
Your dad isn't a schizo,
you were never hospitalized.

2469
01:46:50,477 --> 01:46:51,278
You're gonna believe her?

2470
01:46:51,311 --> 01:46:52,746
My mom's a lying cunt!

2471
01:46:53,913 --> 01:46:55,281
She's saving face.

2472
01:46:55,314 --> 01:46:56,549
She doesn't want
any mental illness

2473
01:46:56,582 --> 01:46:58,451
sullying up that
good family name.

2474
01:46:58,484 --> 01:46:59,952
That's not true.

2475
01:46:59,986 --> 01:47:01,653
She was legitimately
concerned when I asked.

2476
01:47:01,686 --> 01:47:03,156
It did not sound like she
was sweeping something

2477
01:47:03,189 --> 01:47:04,223
- under the rug.
- Then clearly

2478
01:47:04,257 --> 01:47:05,391
she didn't know!

2479
01:47:05,424 --> 01:47:06,492
How would you know
that about your dad

2480
01:47:06,526 --> 01:47:07,593
but his wife wouldn't, huh?

2481
01:47:07,627 --> 01:47:08,594
And how could you hide months

2482
01:47:08,628 --> 01:47:10,396
of a mental break and treatment?

2483
01:47:10,429 --> 01:47:11,864
Look, I don't know what
you're trying to accomplish

2484
01:47:11,898 --> 01:47:15,001
with all this, but I
know you are lying.

2485
01:47:15,034 --> 01:47:17,270
I know, and you were not
going to pull this over on me.

2486
01:47:17,303 --> 01:47:19,738
[clapping]

2487
01:47:19,771 --> 01:47:22,541
Well aren't you the world's
greatest detective, huh?

2488
01:47:22,574 --> 01:47:23,775
Look I don't
know what the hell

2489
01:47:23,808 --> 01:47:26,411
you could possibly be
getting out of this.

2490
01:47:26,444 --> 01:47:27,646
The man I fell in love with

2491
01:47:27,678 --> 01:47:29,648
is just another one of
your personas, isn't he?

2492
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:30,916
Because you're even
less like yourself now

2493
01:47:30,949 --> 01:47:33,018
than when you're God!

2494
01:47:33,051 --> 01:47:35,120
[The Adversary chuckling]

2495
01:47:35,153 --> 01:47:37,122
You're not my boyfriend.

2496
01:47:37,155 --> 01:47:39,723
You know, I was
being sarcastic before.

2497
01:47:39,758 --> 01:47:42,026
Maybe you are a
decent detective.

2498
01:47:42,059 --> 01:47:44,795
Hell, I'll even give you a
genuine clap this time, huh?

2499
01:47:44,828 --> 01:47:46,664
[Gabby] Who are you?

2500
01:47:48,299 --> 01:47:49,900
Hey, God's not the only person

2501
01:47:49,934 --> 01:47:51,602
that could pull this trick.

2502
01:47:51,635 --> 01:47:52,836
Granted we use

2503
01:47:52,870 --> 01:47:54,104
- different methods
- Who are you?!

2504
01:47:54,138 --> 01:47:55,039
[The Adversary]
But the end result

2505
01:47:55,072 --> 01:47:55,906
- all the same!
- I asked you

2506
01:47:55,940 --> 01:47:56,941
who are you?!

2507
01:47:56,974 --> 01:47:57,908
[The Adversary]
You know who I am!

2508
01:47:57,942 --> 01:47:58,708
[dramatic ominous music]

2509
01:47:58,742 --> 01:48:00,177
No, no, you can't be.

2510
01:48:00,211 --> 01:48:01,645
Yeah?

2511
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:03,013
You think your pussy-whipped
fag of a boyfriend's

2512
01:48:03,047 --> 01:48:05,049
got the stones to
talk to you like this?

2513
01:48:07,183 --> 01:48:09,352
[Gabby sobbing]
What?

2514
01:48:09,385 --> 01:48:11,387
You scared of me?

2515
01:48:11,421 --> 01:48:12,555
No.

2516
01:48:12,589 --> 01:48:14,657
I just hate you, I
want my boyfriend back!

2517
01:48:14,691 --> 01:48:16,092
Oh, you hate The Creator.

2518
01:48:16,125 --> 01:48:18,494
Don't pretend you hate me too.

2519
01:48:19,462 --> 01:48:20,797
We're allies in this thing.

2520
01:48:22,465 --> 01:48:24,634
You and I, we're old pals.

2521
01:48:27,003 --> 01:48:28,771
I don't know if you
really are the devil

2522
01:48:28,805 --> 01:48:30,272
or if you're just some
other personality,

2523
01:48:30,305 --> 01:48:32,541
but I don't want anything
to fucking do with you!

2524
01:48:33,709 --> 01:48:34,543
Why?

2525
01:48:35,677 --> 01:48:38,213
Is it because
you're scared of me?

2526
01:48:38,247 --> 01:48:40,482
Think I'm dangerous,
think I might kill you?

2527
01:48:42,284 --> 01:48:45,487
Is it 'cause you know it's
Sunday and you might die?

2528
01:48:46,622 --> 01:48:51,627
Tick tock, tick tock!

2529
01:48:59,367 --> 01:49:01,802
[tense music]

2530
01:49:04,605 --> 01:49:06,140
[knocking]

2531
01:49:06,173 --> 01:49:07,008
Tick tock.

2532
01:49:08,442 --> 01:49:09,543
[Gabby] Holy shit, holy shit.

2533
01:49:09,577 --> 01:49:10,845
Yeah, that's
exactly what this is.

2534
01:49:10,878 --> 01:49:12,046
Some holy shit.

2535
01:49:14,615 --> 01:49:16,250
What are you gonna
do with that huh?

2536
01:49:16,284 --> 01:49:17,817
You're gonna kill Michael?

2537
01:49:17,851 --> 01:49:20,253
Go ahead, bitch,
I'll still be around.

2538
01:49:20,287 --> 01:49:22,389
Your precious
boyfriend will rot here

2539
01:49:22,422 --> 01:49:24,024
while you rot in hell!

2540
01:49:25,458 --> 01:49:27,494
How confident are you that
this isn't really happening?

2541
01:49:28,862 --> 01:49:30,563
Yeah, why don't we
bury the hatchet?

2542
01:49:30,597 --> 01:49:32,265
We've got an eternity
to spend together!

2543
01:49:32,299 --> 01:49:34,100
We're not spending
an eternity together.

2544
01:49:34,134 --> 01:49:35,335
Oh yes we are.

2545
01:49:35,368 --> 01:49:36,771
The last time you
talked to the chief

2546
01:49:36,803 --> 01:49:38,972
you may as well have
spit in his face.

2547
01:49:39,005 --> 01:49:40,674
It's game over honey!

2548
01:49:40,707 --> 01:49:42,074
I'm here to collect!

2549
01:49:43,976 --> 01:49:46,979
[eerie organ music]

2550
01:50:02,127 --> 01:50:03,562
Face it.

2551
01:50:03,595 --> 01:50:04,764
Your time's up.

2552
01:50:04,798 --> 01:50:06,898
You had your chance
and you blew it!

2553
01:50:09,802 --> 01:50:11,602
Hey, look at you?

2554
01:50:11,636 --> 01:50:13,971
Huh, thought you said
you weren't afraid of me.

2555
01:50:16,140 --> 01:50:17,575
It don't matter.

2556
01:50:17,608 --> 01:50:18,843
You're afraid of God,

2557
01:50:18,876 --> 01:50:19,911
you're afraid of me.

2558
01:50:19,944 --> 01:50:22,748
I think maybe you're just weak.

2559
01:50:27,185 --> 01:50:29,020
[Gabby] Fuck off, asshole.

2560
01:50:29,053 --> 01:50:30,654
[The Adversary] I knew
you were my daughter.

2561
01:50:30,687 --> 01:50:33,123
God's little boy scouts don't
talk to people that way.

2562
01:50:33,156 --> 01:50:35,827
Hey, why don't you relax
while you're down there

2563
01:50:35,859 --> 01:50:37,060
and hear me out, huh?

2564
01:50:37,094 --> 01:50:38,662
[Gabby] I said
you can fuck off!

2565
01:50:39,863 --> 01:50:41,098
[The Adversary] This
how you want to spend

2566
01:50:41,131 --> 01:50:42,532
the last few minutes
of your life, huh?

2567
01:50:42,566 --> 01:50:45,102
We can be chatting amicably,
preparing for hell.

2568
01:50:46,838 --> 01:50:48,740
I'm not some horn
beast, you know.

2569
01:50:48,773 --> 01:50:50,340
Mr. A to Z just
paints me that way

2570
01:50:50,374 --> 01:50:52,109
because I have the
audacity to be something

2571
01:50:52,142 --> 01:50:53,343
other than a yes man!

2572
01:50:55,711 --> 01:50:57,380
So why don't you
hear me out, huh?

2573
01:50:59,215 --> 01:51:00,649
Why don't you hear me out?

2574
01:51:00,683 --> 01:51:01,417
Never!

2575
01:51:02,585 --> 01:51:05,154
You don't have
a fucking choice!

2576
01:51:08,958 --> 01:51:10,359
How strong is Michael?

2577
01:51:10,393 --> 01:51:13,362
You think he can throw
you off of here, huh?

2578
01:51:13,396 --> 01:51:15,364
Oh, pretty strong, I guess.

2579
01:51:15,398 --> 01:51:17,932
I can definitely throw you over.

2580
01:51:17,966 --> 01:51:19,434
you're going to listen to me.

2581
01:51:21,936 --> 01:51:23,037
You're not going to sway me.

2582
01:51:23,071 --> 01:51:24,439
I don't have to sway you.

2583
01:51:24,472 --> 01:51:26,107
You made your choice.

2584
01:51:26,141 --> 01:51:28,878
Hell begins now.

2585
01:51:28,910 --> 01:51:32,414
This isn't my pitch,
it's your orientation.

2586
01:51:32,447 --> 01:51:33,816
God doesn't care about you.

2587
01:51:34,983 --> 01:51:37,318
Not unless you're
following his decrees.

2588
01:51:38,219 --> 01:51:39,621
That's all he is,

2589
01:51:39,654 --> 01:51:41,089
dos and don'ts.

2590
01:51:41,122 --> 01:51:42,356
And don't so many of them

2591
01:51:42,389 --> 01:51:45,726
are so fucking
inane and arbitrary!

2592
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:49,496
The only thing he's building
is a cosmic dictatorship

2593
01:51:49,530 --> 01:51:50,964
where you are on your knees,

2594
01:51:50,998 --> 01:51:53,700
forced to do exactly as he says.

2595
01:51:54,635 --> 01:51:56,603
That sound like paradise to you?

2596
01:51:56,637 --> 01:51:59,808
Where I'm taking
you is the paradise.

2597
01:51:59,841 --> 01:52:01,776
Somewhere you can
do as you will.

2598
01:52:01,810 --> 01:52:03,912
That's the whole of my law.

2599
01:52:04,978 --> 01:52:06,312
You want something?

2600
01:52:06,345 --> 01:52:08,514
Take it, it's yours.

2601
01:52:10,450 --> 01:52:12,151
And nobody tells
you you're wrong.

2602
01:52:12,185 --> 01:52:15,121
Not even the celestial
homeowners association

2603
01:52:15,154 --> 01:52:17,056
that goes breathing
down your asshole!

2604
01:52:18,759 --> 01:52:19,760
Where do you draw the line?

2605
01:52:19,793 --> 01:52:21,327
I don't, you do.

2606
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:23,095
And everyone else draws theirs.

2607
01:52:25,097 --> 01:52:27,667
And nobody gets to tell each
other who's right or wrong

2608
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:31,403
because you're all gods.

2609
01:52:31,436 --> 01:52:36,141
If someone wants
to rape or torture?

2610
01:52:36,174 --> 01:52:39,478
Now, that's the right
of a god, isn't it?

2611
01:52:41,046 --> 01:52:42,447
To do as they please?

2612
01:52:45,317 --> 01:52:47,219
If you want to do something,

2613
01:52:47,252 --> 01:52:49,120
who's going to tell
you you're wrong?

2614
01:52:49,154 --> 01:52:51,423
That's the right
of a god, isn't it?

2615
01:52:53,725 --> 01:52:55,059
You didn't ask to be made.

2616
01:52:56,293 --> 01:52:57,661
Nobody did.

2617
01:52:57,695 --> 01:52:59,096
I sure didn't it.

2618
01:52:59,129 --> 01:53:02,199
Heaven's CEO made that
executive decision without us.

2619
01:53:02,233 --> 01:53:03,667
He's the one who chose

2620
01:53:03,701 --> 01:53:07,772
to bring about a life
rife with misery and pain.

2621
01:53:07,806 --> 01:53:09,340
Look around!

2622
01:53:09,373 --> 01:53:12,409
This is what happens when
something all powerful

2623
01:53:12,443 --> 01:53:15,713
just gets to
unilaterally create life!

2624
01:53:16,614 --> 01:53:17,447
It suffers.

2625
01:53:19,215 --> 01:53:23,653
Existence is an
oversight, a mistake!

2626
01:53:25,722 --> 01:53:27,290
But because some guy decided

2627
01:53:28,993 --> 01:53:30,560
that he had to be worshiped

2628
01:53:30,593 --> 01:53:34,197
or he couldn't spend an
eternity all the fuck alone,

2629
01:53:35,833 --> 01:53:39,970
he chose you to live among
the scum and the bile.

2630
01:53:41,271 --> 01:53:43,071
None of this should be here!

2631
01:53:45,707 --> 01:53:49,444
But since it is, I'm
here to save you.

2632
01:53:49,478 --> 01:53:51,346
I'm going to take
you out of that filth

2633
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:52,782
in which you were created

2634
01:53:52,815 --> 01:53:54,918
and I'm going to make you a god!

2635
01:53:57,286 --> 01:53:58,520
Ain't that noble of me?

2636
01:53:59,621 --> 01:54:01,290
[Gabby spitting]

2637
01:54:01,323 --> 01:54:02,124
Huh.

2638
01:54:03,927 --> 01:54:05,593
The offer still stands.

2639
01:54:08,663 --> 01:54:09,630
Mmm.

2640
01:54:09,664 --> 01:54:12,300
Nothing about you is noble.

2641
01:54:12,333 --> 01:54:13,167
Oh.

2642
01:54:14,569 --> 01:54:15,771
I know your type.

2643
01:54:15,804 --> 01:54:19,173
You're just another
prick who can't stand

2644
01:54:19,206 --> 01:54:20,441
being told what to do.

2645
01:54:21,542 --> 01:54:24,111
A bully who loves
making people miserable.

2646
01:54:25,646 --> 01:54:27,682
You're not a god.

2647
01:54:27,715 --> 01:54:29,850
You're not going
to make me a god.

2648
01:54:29,884 --> 01:54:31,384
You know what, you're right.

2649
01:54:31,418 --> 01:54:32,652
I don't particularly like rules,

2650
01:54:32,686 --> 01:54:34,521
but I'm not in the habit
of tearing down fences

2651
01:54:34,554 --> 01:54:36,189
when I don't know why
they were put there.

2652
01:54:36,222 --> 01:54:39,192
So if his laws keep people
from being anything like you,

2653
01:54:39,225 --> 01:54:41,227
then I guess they're
there for a good reason.

2654
01:54:41,261 --> 01:54:42,495
If you're the opposition to God,

2655
01:54:42,529 --> 01:54:44,832
then God must be the
best possible thing!

2656
01:54:44,865 --> 01:54:46,499
It was a nice speech.

2657
01:54:47,768 --> 01:54:50,570
But you're still joining me.
[ominous music]

2658
01:54:50,604 --> 01:54:52,339
And you'll like it
so much better there

2659
01:54:52,372 --> 01:54:55,574
from under the thumb of the
King's rules and regulations!

2660
01:54:55,608 --> 01:54:57,309
I've heard all about
hell and it's nothing

2661
01:54:57,343 --> 01:54:58,243
- like what you say!
- Yeah well

2662
01:54:58,277 --> 01:55:00,346
who'd you hear that from, God?

2663
01:55:01,513 --> 01:55:02,749
He doesn't know.

2664
01:55:02,782 --> 01:55:06,285
He's never been there
and neither have you.

2665
01:55:06,318 --> 01:55:09,221
Why don't you come
see for yourself?

2666
01:55:09,254 --> 01:55:10,056
Dear Lord-

2667
01:55:10,090 --> 01:55:10,924
- He's not listening!

2668
01:55:13,459 --> 01:55:17,196
Besides, you don't
want to go to heaven.

2669
01:55:17,228 --> 01:55:19,732
Don't you want to be
where your mother is?

2670
01:55:19,765 --> 01:55:23,468
I bet she could really
use a drink right now.

2671
01:55:23,501 --> 01:55:24,335
Four years down,

2672
01:55:25,203 --> 01:55:26,704
infinity to go!

2673
01:55:26,739 --> 01:55:28,206
Dear Lord!

2674
01:55:28,239 --> 01:55:30,208
Please, I don't care if
you save my life tonight.

2675
01:55:30,241 --> 01:55:32,577
Just don't let me
go to hell, please.

2676
01:55:32,610 --> 01:55:33,912
No more questions, I
trust you, I promise.

2677
01:55:33,946 --> 01:55:36,381
So please just take
me home, please.

2678
01:55:38,616 --> 01:55:41,351
[dramatic music]

2679
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:45,155
This isn't over!

2680
01:55:45,188 --> 01:55:46,758
I'll see you on the other side.

2681
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:58,335
[calm music]

2682
01:55:58,368 --> 01:56:00,237
I knew you were mine.

2683
01:56:00,270 --> 01:56:01,906
[Gabby] I love
you, I trust you.

2684
01:56:03,407 --> 01:56:04,909
I love you so much.

2685
01:56:07,844 --> 01:56:09,345
What's going on, where are we?

2686
01:56:09,378 --> 01:56:11,213
It happened again.

2687
01:56:11,247 --> 01:56:13,116
It happened again,
what happened?

2688
01:56:13,150 --> 01:56:15,986
A lot of things
but He was here.

2689
01:56:16,019 --> 01:56:16,820
Who was here?

2690
01:56:17,888 --> 01:56:18,722
God?

2691
01:56:20,023 --> 01:56:20,857
What?

2692
01:56:21,958 --> 01:56:23,359
How much weed did we smoke?

2693
01:56:26,662 --> 01:56:30,365
And then he was like, holding
me over the fucking balcony.

2694
01:56:30,398 --> 01:56:32,902
And I called out to God
and then he came back

2695
01:56:32,935 --> 01:56:35,537
and we hugged and
basically just professed

2696
01:56:35,570 --> 01:56:36,705
our love for each other.

2697
01:56:36,739 --> 01:56:40,341
And then you were
back, like really back.

2698
01:56:40,375 --> 01:56:42,343
The last thing I remember

2699
01:56:42,377 --> 01:56:44,914
is dancing with you
in the living room.

2700
01:56:44,947 --> 01:56:46,514
And you're trying to tell
me that was two days ago?

2701
01:56:46,548 --> 01:56:48,316
Wow, yeah.

2702
01:56:49,885 --> 01:56:52,788
Oh, I feel so nasty knowing I
spent so much time with him.

2703
01:56:54,521 --> 01:56:55,489
I even kissed him.

2704
01:56:55,522 --> 01:56:57,624
Well, you thought he was me so

2705
01:56:57,658 --> 01:56:59,560
I can't really hold
you responsible

2706
01:56:59,593 --> 01:57:01,261
for cheating on
me with the devil.

2707
01:57:02,563 --> 01:57:04,264
He's a subtle
bastard, that one.

2708
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:06,333
I'm so sorry.

2709
01:57:06,366 --> 01:57:08,002
No, don't be.

2710
01:57:08,036 --> 01:57:09,403
It wasn't you.

2711
01:57:09,436 --> 01:57:10,872
That's a hard pill to swallow.

2712
01:57:10,905 --> 01:57:11,740
Listen.

2713
01:57:13,174 --> 01:57:15,375
I know this probably won't
mean much at this point

2714
01:57:15,409 --> 01:57:17,911
since I can't have more
than a few hours left, but

2715
01:57:19,312 --> 01:57:22,348
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

2716
01:57:22,381 --> 01:57:23,217
You have me,

2717
01:57:24,283 --> 01:57:25,418
for as long as that is.

2718
01:57:28,688 --> 01:57:29,790
Are you scared?

2719
01:57:29,823 --> 01:57:32,358
Of the transition, but,

2720
01:57:32,391 --> 01:57:35,763
I mean exchanging earth for
heaven can't be all bad.

2721
01:57:35,796 --> 01:57:37,898
I really, really love you.

2722
01:57:37,931 --> 01:57:38,799
I love you too.

2723
01:57:40,134 --> 01:57:40,934
Wow.

2724
01:57:42,034 --> 01:57:43,368
Oh wow.

2725
01:57:43,401 --> 01:57:44,636
God really does this?

2726
01:57:46,038 --> 01:57:46,839
Wow.

2727
01:57:47,874 --> 01:57:49,541
It's so beautiful.

2728
01:57:49,574 --> 01:57:50,609
He's so beautiful.

2729
01:57:54,679 --> 01:57:57,116
[light music]

2730
01:57:57,150 --> 01:57:58,718
What was that all about?

2731
01:57:58,751 --> 01:58:00,853
I let him feel my
presence as I came through.

2732
01:58:00,887 --> 01:58:02,420
He was still struggling
with it for a bit.

2733
01:58:02,454 --> 01:58:03,622
What?

2734
01:58:03,655 --> 01:58:06,057
He gets to know
you just like that?

2735
01:58:06,091 --> 01:58:07,358
Why couldn't you do that for me?

2736
01:58:07,391 --> 01:58:09,761
I dealt with Michael
in his own way long ago.

2737
01:58:11,229 --> 01:58:14,532
He was tuned into me enough to
use him as a conduit for you.

2738
01:58:14,565 --> 01:58:16,868
I'm just letting the radio
hear the song it played.

2739
01:58:18,536 --> 01:58:19,637
You know, you embellished a bit

2740
01:58:19,670 --> 01:58:20,671
when you told
Michael what happened

2741
01:58:20,704 --> 01:58:21,873
Well, what can I say?

2742
01:58:21,907 --> 01:58:24,009
I have a flare for
the dramatic, I guess.

2743
01:58:25,476 --> 01:58:26,945
You made me that way.

2744
01:58:26,978 --> 01:58:28,546
If it makes you
feel any better

2745
01:58:28,579 --> 01:58:30,948
the drama you added,
it only conveyed

2746
01:58:30,981 --> 01:58:34,084
how all those things you
couldn't describe really felt.

2747
01:58:34,118 --> 01:58:35,986
It's not quite
the same as lying.

2748
01:58:36,020 --> 01:58:36,821
Hey.

2749
01:58:38,956 --> 01:58:40,858
Can I ask you something?

2750
01:58:40,891 --> 01:58:41,725
He lied.

2751
01:58:43,294 --> 01:58:44,494
She made it.

2752
01:58:44,527 --> 01:58:45,896
She's with me.

2753
01:58:45,930 --> 01:58:46,897
Really?

2754
01:58:46,931 --> 01:58:49,066
[The Lord] Mhmm.

2755
01:58:49,099 --> 01:58:50,366
He's such an asshole!

2756
01:58:52,435 --> 01:58:53,770
Yeah.

2757
01:58:53,803 --> 01:58:54,636
Yeah.

2758
01:58:55,537 --> 01:58:56,371
That's okay.

2759
01:58:57,207 --> 01:58:58,041
You can ask.

2760
01:58:58,975 --> 01:59:00,076
When does it happen?

2761
01:59:01,244 --> 01:59:03,046
If you don't
mind the spoilers,

2762
01:59:03,079 --> 01:59:04,546
61 years from this June.

2763
01:59:06,316 --> 01:59:08,218
Wait, but you said...

2764
01:59:08,251 --> 01:59:09,752
I thought I died this weekend.

2765
01:59:09,786 --> 01:59:11,120
You did.

2766
01:59:11,154 --> 01:59:13,022
On that balcony this
morning, the old you did die.

2767
01:59:13,056 --> 01:59:14,791
You're a new woman, Gabrielle.

2768
01:59:14,824 --> 01:59:16,960
You said I was going to die

2769
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:18,559
like actually, like physically.

2770
01:59:18,593 --> 01:59:20,028
What can I say?

2771
01:59:20,062 --> 01:59:22,130
I guess I have a little
flare for the dramatic too.

2772
01:59:23,298 --> 01:59:25,399
I did make you in
my image after all.

2773
01:59:25,433 --> 01:59:26,235
Fair enough.

2774
01:59:27,602 --> 01:59:29,037
Although if you
hadn't come to me

2775
01:59:29,071 --> 01:59:30,605
he genuinely would have
killed you on that balcony.

2776
01:59:30,638 --> 01:59:31,472
But now...

2777
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:34,575
Well, you can't leave yet.

2778
01:59:34,609 --> 01:59:35,509
You guys have a lot of heaven

2779
01:59:35,543 --> 01:59:37,246
to bring into this place for me.

2780
01:59:37,279 --> 01:59:38,113
Really?

2781
01:59:38,146 --> 01:59:39,547
Oh yeah.

2782
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:41,082
You're on my payroll now, kid.

2783
01:59:42,515 --> 01:59:44,185
And I've got a
lot for you to do.

2784
01:59:44,218 --> 01:59:46,020
What do I have to do?

2785
01:59:46,053 --> 01:59:46,921
How will I know?

2786
01:59:46,954 --> 01:59:47,788
Is it going to be as scary

2787
01:59:47,822 --> 01:59:48,555
- or as dangerous-
- Hey.

2788
01:59:48,588 --> 01:59:49,422
Hey.

2789
01:59:50,358 --> 01:59:51,691
You trust me, right?

2790
01:59:51,726 --> 01:59:53,227
Completely.

2791
01:59:53,261 --> 01:59:55,830
Then you know everything's
going to be okay, don't you?

2792
01:59:55,863 --> 01:59:58,698
[uplifting music]

2793
02:00:05,105 --> 02:00:07,707
[Gabby] The
sunrise is beautiful.

2794
02:00:07,741 --> 02:00:09,675
[The Lord] Thank you.
