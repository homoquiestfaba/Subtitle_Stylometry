1
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:00,239
- Handme the flashlight.
- Here it is.

2
00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:06,243
- Kit, l´vegot theshovel.
- You do?

3
00:00:06,345 --> 00:00:09,508
Lucy, get the box.

4
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:00,192
- What areyouputting in?
- lt´ssupposedto be a secret.

5
00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:02,092
- What areyouputting in?

6
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:08,592
- My dadthinksl´m atyourhouse.
- Mymom thinksl´m atyours.

7
00:00:10,836 --> 00:00:12,531
Let´s dig deep.

8
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,501
So no one will find it.

9
00:00:17,843 --> 00:00:22,576
- Dig it deeper!
- We don´t wanna get caught.

10
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:00,239
I want some dirt.

11
00:00:03,042 --> 00:00:07,809
When we were tengrowing up
in Georgia, Mimi, Kit andl...

12
00:00:07,913 --> 00:00:11,974
knewexactly what we wanted
out oflife.

13
00:00:12,084 --> 00:00:14,780
- Lucy, get the box.
- This is fun.

14
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:19,915
So weput ourdreamsin a box,
and we buriedit.

15
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:22,426
We have to keep it dry.

16
00:00:31,537 --> 00:00:34,995
We made apact to dig it up
at midnight...

17
00:00:35,107 --> 00:00:38,235
the dayofour
high schoolgraduation.

18
00:00:38,344 --> 00:00:40,642
Pack it down.

19
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:04,960
- Let´s be best friends forever.
- We will.

20
00:00:05,063 --> 00:00:08,191
Now, ldon´t even remember
what our wishes were--

21
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,268
except forone.

22
00:00:10,368 --> 00:00:14,236
We wishedthat we´dbe
best friends forever.

23
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:18,400
Well, that wish
didn ´t come true.

24
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:13,745

- Baby, we´re gonna be late.

36
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,739
- Did you practice your speech?
- I almost have it.

37
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,639
Lucy, how´s it gonna look ifthe
valedictorian messes up her speech?

38
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:20,438
Okay.

39
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:23,742
Don´t wrinkle your robe.

40
00:00:26,218 --> 00:00:30,746
Okay, big day! Come on!
See ya on deck! Let´s go!

41
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:33,848
Toads do look like frogs.

42
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:36,894
It´sjust one´s, you know,
in the water and one´s not.

43
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,623
It doesn´t--
It could happen to anybody.

44
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,392
Hey, Mimi!
I know you want me.

45
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:48,266
Ho!

46
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:50,568
I´m gonna look
drop-dead gorgeous.

47
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,337
You should see my dress.

48
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:57,643
- Hello! Watch where you´re going!
- You ran into me, Kit.

49
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:00,047
What, you´re too perfect
to bump into anybody?

50
00:01:00,152 --> 00:01:02,245
- What?
- Perfect.

51
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:05,983
Sweet, proper...

52
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:08,218
nerdy and virginal.

53
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:10,817
- I´m not--
- You´re a virgin.

54
00:01:10,929 --> 00:01:13,261
I told y´all.

55
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:17,665
just get us in the picture, okay?
Hold my purse.

56
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:21,432
No, don´t push the button.
Wait till I get over there. Honey!

57
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,773
- Mama, what are you doing?
- One second. Stand up straight.

58
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:30,006
- I am. I will.
- Tuckyour tummy in.

59
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:32,413
- Smile.
- Mom, I´m smiling!

60
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:34,576
Bigger, darling.

61
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:38,747
- Lucy, your speech was wonderful.
- Thankyou.

62
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:41,485
I hope you´re gonna continue
studying music in college.

63
00:01:41,593 --> 00:01:43,584
Actually, Lucy wants
to become a doctor.

64
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:46,630
Voice classes would make
nice electives.

65
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,791
No time. We´re looking at a double
major in biology and chemistry...

66
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:54,270
ifshe wants to get into
the best med school, huh?

67
00:01:54,372 --> 00:01:57,205
Henry, I´ll show you how
to start that truck for tonight.

68
00:01:57,309 --> 00:02:00,369
All right.
See you later.

69
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,641
- Bye, Ms.J.
- Good luck, Henry.

70
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:07,276
I´m all he´s got, you know?

71
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:09,353
Congratulations, Lucy.

72
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,488
Thankyou. Thanks.

73
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:27,701
Here it is.
Honey, what´s wrong?

74
00:02:27,806 --> 00:00:00,239
I´m fine.

75
00:00:01,941 --> 00:00:06,742
Pop, I worked really hard
to be the valedictorian.

76
00:00:06,846 --> 00:00:09,007
Course you did.

77
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,182
Why didn´t it feel
like anything?

78
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:16,777
What do you mean, you didn´t
feel anything? It felt great!

79
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:21,292
Pop, I never went
to one football game.

80
00:00:21,394 --> 00:00:23,589
You don´t like football.

81
00:00:23,696 --> 00:00:27,530
But you´re supposed to go,
and it´s supposed to be fun.

82
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:31,296
And like all the parties
at Hemmings Field and stuff...

83
00:00:31,404 --> 00:00:34,168
I never went to any of´em.

84
00:00:34,273 --> 00:00:39,267
I never stayed out late.
I neverjust hung out.

85
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:41,710
´Cause you had
a head on your shoulders.

86
00:00:41,814 --> 00:00:00,192
You stayed home, and you studied.

87
00:00:00,258 --> 00:00:04,160
There´sjust a lot ofthings
that I wanted to do that I didn´t.

88
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:09,164
And I was up there getting
my diploma, and I was like...

89
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:11,235
´´Is this it?´´

90
00:00:11,336 --> 00:00:15,432
Come on now. Didn´t we both
work hard for this?

91
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,837
You´re right.

92
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:23,779
I guess it´sjust the pressure
of graduation. You´re right.

93
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,286
Girls, hi!

94
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,663
Lucy.

95
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,567
Mimi, not now. Okay?

96
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,542
- Are you comin´ or not?
- Coming where?

97
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:55,579
It´s graduation night!

98
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,548
Oh, God, Hemmings Field.
I totally forgot.

99
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:02,245
So, are you comin´ or not?

100
00:01:04,556 --> 00:01:08,185
I have plans.
I´m sorry.

101
00:01:08,293 --> 00:01:11,091
Come on. You okay?

102
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:23,239
Do you want something?

103
00:01:23,341 --> 00:01:26,174
Yeah. Are you coming
at midnight or what?

104
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:28,678
Excuse me?

105
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,112
Kit, we made a pact, remember?

106
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:34,447
Oh, you´re not serious!

107
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:38,990
Well, look, you can
really go without me.

108
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,924
I have better things to do
than dig up some old box.

109
00:01:46,965 --> 00:01:49,934
Standinghere
lookingat allthe world

110
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:03,842
The guitar guy is such a hottie.

111
00:02:03,949 --> 00:02:05,473
That´s Ben Kimble.

112
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,984
I heard hejust got out ofjail.
Killed a guy.

113
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,350
I don´t believe you.

114
00:02:11,456 --> 00:02:14,687
Yeah! Everybody´s talking about it.

115
00:02:14,793 --> 00:02:16,522
Oh, too bad!

116
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:19,392
Well, ifanyone could have him,
it´d be you.

117
00:02:19,497 --> 00:02:22,989
But I´m offthe market, remember?

118
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,036
Oh, please!
Dylan´s at UCLA doing...

119
00:02:26,137 --> 00:02:28,196
God knows what
with God knows who.

120
00:02:28,306 --> 00:02:29,864
That´s not true.

121
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:31,340
Right.

122
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,343
Whatever.

123
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:38,505
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, yeah, just two seconds.

124
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,523
Okay, hold on.

125
00:02:48,960 --> 00:00:00,239
Henry, are you ready?

126
00:00:00,239 --> 00:00:02,070
Henry, are you ready?

127
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,200
I´m ready.

128
00:00:31,937 --> 00:00:33,837
That´s okay. Go on.

129
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,518
Why are you stopping?

130
00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:02,285
This isn´t how I hoped it would be.

131
00:00:02,394 --> 00:00:05,591
That´s weird, ´cause this is
exactly how I hoped it would be...

132
00:00:05,697 --> 00:00:08,165
or pretty accurate.

133
00:00:08,266 --> 00:00:13,203
- Maybe ifwe get into bed.
- That´s a good idea.

134
00:00:17,242 --> 00:00:19,437
These are nice sheets.

135
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,810
- Can I hear the list again?
- Oh, Luce, come on.

136
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:28,408
Please, please.
just one more time.

137
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:34,088
Thanks.

138
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:36,217
All right.

139
00:00:40,432 --> 00:00:41,865
Reason number one:

140
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:45,960
We´ve been lab partners for three
years so we really trust each other.

141
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:49,165
- That´s really important. Okay.
- Trust is very important.

142
00:00:49,274 --> 00:00:51,970
Reason number two: We are both 1 8
and have never done it.

143
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:54,511
Very important!

144
00:00:55,747 --> 00:00:57,271
Reason number three:

145
00:00:57,382 --> 00:01:00,715
We both want to do it.

146
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:02,719
Reason number four--

147
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:07,825
Please, Lucy, come on. Please.

148
00:01:07,926 --> 00:01:11,828
I´m, I´m begging you.
Please, let´sjust do it.

149
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,525
- Okay, yeah, we can do it.
- Yeah?

150
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:17,693
Okay, so let´s--

151
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:24,201
- I´ll go this way.
- Okay, I´m going this way.

152
00:01:24,309 --> 00:01:26,209
Let´s do this.

153
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:34,416
Please don´t laugh.
You´re killing this.

154
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:38,114
- Your first time should be special.
- Yeah, this is special!

155
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:41,124
Listen, do you want to spend
the rest ofyour life...

156
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,626
knowing that you did it for the
first time with your lab partner?

157
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:46,629
Yes, yes, I do.
And I´ll tell you why.

158
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,894
Because you know what it´s like
for a guy to go to college a virgin?

159
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:52,401
No, I´m telling you
they, they--

160
00:01:52,504 --> 00:01:55,735
They´re ostracized!
They treat them like lepers!

161
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,364
I´m sorry.

162
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,340
- What´s up, Mimi? How´s the fetus?
- Drop dead.

163
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:07,009
- Is it mine or what?
- I can´t believe we went out.

164
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,349
- I´m trying to do the right thing.
- Yeah? What´s the right thing?

165
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:12,946
Ignoring me
for the past five months?

166
00:02:13,058 --> 00:02:16,516
Letting your friends call me a ho?
Spreading rumors?

167
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:19,324
I´m repeating what I heard,
that you let some guy...

168
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:22,423
do you in his car
over Christmas break.

169
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:26,102
jerk.

170
00:02:31,509 --> 00:02:33,739
It´s ten paces
on the other side.

171
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:38,346
- What are you doing here?
- Where´s Lucy?

172
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,111
She´s not comin´.

173
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,047
- You have a flashlight? Good.
- Gimme back my flashlight!

174
00:02:56,701 --> 00:03:00,296
Let´sjust get this
over with, okay?

175
00:00:08,547 --> 00:00:12,745
God, I don´t even remember
what we put in here.

176
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:14,752
Me either.

177
00:00:14,854 --> 00:00:17,652
Here, hold this
for a second, Lucy.

178
00:00:30,102 --> 00:00:00,192
My Bridal Barbie!

179
00:00:00,258 --> 00:00:02,920
She was my wish.

180
00:00:03,028 --> 00:00:05,656
- You´re gettin´ your wish.
- I know.

181
00:00:07,732 --> 00:00:10,166
Lucy, I think this is yours.

182
00:00:10,268 --> 00:00:12,600
- My locket.
- What did you wish for?

183
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,502
I wanted to find my mom.

184
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,236
Did you ever find her?

185
00:00:19,344 --> 00:00:24,247
No, she lives in Arizona and my pop
doesn´t think it´s a good idea, so--

186
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:27,546
What did you wish for?

187
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:33,316
- A key chain?
- No, the world.

188
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:36,656
That I was gonna get out
ofthis crappy town...

189
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:38,991
go all the way to California...

190
00:00:39,097 --> 00:00:43,591
put my feet
in the Pacific Ocean.

191
00:00:43,702 --> 00:00:46,694
There´s a wish that´s not
coming true for a while.

192
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:50,798
- A lot you know, Kit.
- What´s that supposed to mean?

193
00:00:56,314 --> 00:00:58,214
Slide Records recording contest?

194
00:00:58,316 --> 00:01:02,309
- So?
- So I´m going on Sunday.

195
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,447
You´re going to California
to audition for a record company?

196
00:01:06,558 --> 00:01:09,550
- Yeah.
- You´re pregnant.

197
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:12,562
- So? I´ll wear something slimming.
- And what?

198
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:14,894
You thinkyou´re gonna become
this big, fat, pregnant star?

199
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,766
- I have a pretty good voice.
- How are you gonna get there?

200
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,806
- I found a ride with this guy.
- What? No, that is crazy.

201
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:25,843
You can´t go to Los Angeles
by yourselfwith some guy.

202
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:30,643
So? Then come with me. I´ll sing
lead, and you can sing backups.

203
00:01:30,749 --> 00:01:33,684
- It´s not something we should do.
- It´s stupid is what it is.

204
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:36,515
Okay, fine.
You know what?

205
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:39,146
You can just forget
all your past!

206
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,793
Oh, wow.

207
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:49,828
- Oh, my goodness. Look at us!
- Let me see.

208
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:52,768
- I was so chubby.
- Singing.

209
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:59,269
- I have to go meet my friends.
- Yeah, it´s getting late.

210
00:02:01,112 --> 00:02:02,511
Yeah.

211
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:07,713
Hey, you guys.

212
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:12,153
I´m leaving Sunday at 7:00 a.m.
ifyou all wanna come.

213
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:22,696
What do you mean you´re not
coming home for the summer?

214
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:25,565
Dylan, listen to me,
you have to come home.

215
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,504
Because! I haven´t seen you
since Christmas.

216
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,508
Don´t you miss me?

217
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,512
- Excuse me.
- Dad, customer!

218
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:37,844
Dylan, we have to plan
the wedding.

219
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,644
All right.

220
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:43,016
I love you--
Dylan?

221
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:55,598
- Hey, darlin´.
- Hey, Pop.

222
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,192
Dr.Johnson called today.
Good news.

223
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,431
Got me a job at the hospital?

224
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,837
All those discounts I gave him
finally paid off.

225
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:06,240
- Cool.
- Yep.

226
00:03:06,344 --> 00:03:09,211
Can I askyou a question?

227
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,941
It´s about Mother.

228
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:19,416
- Has she ever tried to see me?
- No, she hasn´t.

229
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:22,550
I was thinking,
maybe she´s afraid to visit me.

230
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,255
Luce, you do not have
to feel any guilt...

231
00:03:25,363 --> 00:03:28,093
about your mother leaving us.

232
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:29,928
This is not about us.

233
00:03:30,035 --> 00:03:33,027
She was the one who walked out
on a three-year-old.

234
00:03:33,138 --> 00:03:36,630
She´s the one that should
feel guilty. All right?

235
00:03:36,741 --> 00:03:38,868
All right.

236
00:00:02,861 --> 00:00:04,920
Nobody brings four suitcases
on a road trip.

237
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,261
Look, Dylan asked me
to go see him in LA...

238
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:10,960
and I can´t get there
looking like a skank.

239
00:00:11,069 --> 00:00:13,560
You better hope it all fits.

240
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:15,640
It will, okay?

241
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:22,903
I´m not going to the audition.
You can drop me off in Arizona.

242
00:00:23,014 --> 00:00:25,448
- Fine.
- Fine.

243
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,611
- Fine. Shotgun.
- Yeah, right. I´m sitting up front.

244
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:34,224
You must be Lucy.

245
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,657
Yeah.

246
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:40,765
So you´re taking us to L.A.?

247
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:43,300
Yeah. I´ll get your bag.

248
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:48,396
- You okay? Sorry.
- Yeah, I´m fine.

249
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:52,671
- Move it, Ben! Let´s go!
- I´ll get the door foryou.

250
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:00,984
Hey, who´s the guy?

251
00:01:01,086 --> 00:01:04,419
That´sjust Ben.
He´s really cool.

252
00:01:06,224 --> 00:01:08,124
Let´s hit it.

253
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:30,532
Where´s the bathroom?

254
00:00:30,636 --> 00:00:33,264
Second door.
There´s no soap.

255
00:00:06,364 --> 00:00:08,264
What´s the deal with Lucy?

256
00:00:08,366 --> 00:00:11,858
- What, are you hot for her?
- No.

257
00:00:13,505 --> 00:00:17,339
I wouldn´t even try, Ben.
Seriously, she´s not like us.

258
00:00:17,442 --> 00:00:19,433
She´s way out ofyour league.

259
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,579
Want a chip?

260
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:29,353
Get outta here.

261
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:40,294
What are you doin´?

262
00:00:40,398 --> 00:00:43,060
- What´s with this music?
- Well, I like it.

263
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,432
Can we listen to something else
for ten minutes?

264
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,195
No.

265
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:50,206
Come on, Ben, please?

266
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:51,900
Be a nice guy.

267
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,774
Okay, five minutes.
just five minutes.

268
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,245
Thankyou.

269
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:02,418

Bye, bye

275
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:22,063
Baby

276
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:28,012
- Ben!
- I can´t listen to this.

277
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:30,308
- You said five minutes.
- Forget it.

278
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:33,077
Like this is any better.

279
00:01:47,132 --> 00:01:50,624
- Why are we stopped?
- I´m tired.

280
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,327
Let someone else drive.

281
00:01:52,437 --> 00:01:55,099
No, nobody drives
the cruiser but me.

282
00:01:55,207 --> 00:01:58,335
- Okay, whatever.
- Where are we gonna sleep?

283
00:01:58,443 --> 00:02:01,105
There´s a field.
I got a tent and sleeping bags.

284
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,141
A field?

285
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:08,882
No, I don´t sleep in a field.

286
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:11,455
I saw a sign for a Hilton
back there.

287
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:14,116
How much money do we have?

288
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:21,294
I can´t believe
you only brought $40.

289
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:26,234
I have expenses. I had to have
my homecoming dress custom-made.

290
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:28,533
I was voted queen, you know.

291
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,234
Oh, my dream come true.

292
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:35,074
- Did anybody make a plan?
- What do you mean?

293
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,308
How faryou´ll drive each day?
Which towns you´ll stop in?

294
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:41,010
How much gas money you´ll need?

295
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,020
Okay.

296
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:48,718
We have $486, right?
Which means...

297
00:02:48,827 --> 00:02:52,024
for food, gas--

298
00:02:53,898 --> 00:02:55,331
Is it enough?

299
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:58,095
It´s gonna be tight.

300
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,401
Oh, my gosh.

301
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:07,603
It´s a love room.

302
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,545
Oh, man!

303
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,207
Look at the walls!

304
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,047
- I´m not sleeping here!
- This is what we can afford.

305
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,644
Is this run by the hour?
I´m not sleeping here.

306
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:20,054
- Where you gonna sleep?
- I don´t know.

307
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,753
This place is disgusting.
I´ll take this bed.

308
00:03:33,905 --> 00:03:36,066
So how come
you´re going to L.A.?

309
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:42,076
My uncle might have
a job for me there...

310
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,742
so I´m gonna check it out
and if I like it, I´ll move there.

311
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:50,252
What about your band?
Don´t you have a band?

312
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,756
No, I wasjust filling in the
other night. I don´t have a band.

313
00:03:56,561 --> 00:03:59,758
Mimi said that she didn´t think
you´d come with us on the trip.

314
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:03,567
Neither did I.

315
00:04:03,668 --> 00:04:06,228
You sorry you did?

316
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:08,602
Not so far.

317
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,674
Well, good night.

318
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:19,682
Good night.

319
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:42,632
Hey! It´s freakin´ cold!

320
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,676
- We´re in here.
- I´m in here.

321
00:04:45,777 --> 00:04:48,337
I just need
to brush my teeth.

322
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,855
- What are you doing?
- You´re so touchy.

323
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:04,159
Mimi, how do you know Ben?

324
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:08,528
-Just from around.
- Gosh, don´t you think he´s cute?

325
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:12,660
- He´s all right.
- I can´t believe he was in jail.

326
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,672
- What?
- Yeah!

327
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,369
He like killed a guy.
What? That´s what I heard.

328
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:21,911
Excuse me?
He killed somebody?

329
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:27,144
No, he did not kill anybody--
I don´t think.

330
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:30,983
Okay, he had a car, he was
coming to L.A. Don´t be upset.

331
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:35,082
I´m on a road trip with a killer and
you´re telling me not to be upset?

332
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:38,321
- He´ll hearyou.
- Oh, my God.

333
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:46,231
What´s up?

334
00:05:51,609 --> 00:05:53,668
Do you know him at all?

335
00:05:53,778 --> 00:05:57,373
He used to hang out with some
ofthe guys at the trailer park.

336
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:01,678
So he may have
killed someone, okay?

337
00:06:01,786 --> 00:06:06,280
So what? He did his time.
He paid his debt to society.

338
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:08,916
Oh, my God.

339
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:17,295
Ready to go?

340
00:06:17,402 --> 00:06:19,267
Yeah.

341
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,238
Hey, you wanna ride up front
with me today?

342
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:27,539
No, that´s okay.
The backseat´s fine. It´s okay.

343
00:06:27,645 --> 00:06:30,876
- I´ll check us out, okay?
- Yeah.

344
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:46,829
- I´ll be back.
- I´ll come with ya.

345
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:49,024
No, it´s okay, I´m fine.

346
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:52,796
- Will you please get me some chips?
- No, Mimi.

347
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:54,462
Open the door.

348
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:00,137
I´ll get my own chips.

349
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:06,413
Y´all, wait for me!

350
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:16,653
So when he came home
last Christmas, he proposed.

351
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:19,924
He´s comin´ home as soon as
he´s done with school next spring.

352
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:22,795
You´re seriously
gonna marry that loser?

353
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,869
You don´t even know him.

354
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:31,304
- What´s wrong?
- Nothing. Itjust kicked, is all.

355
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:33,468
- Can I feel it?
- Ifyou want.

356
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,871
It kicked again.

357
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,711
- What about Kurt?
- What about Kurt?

358
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:43,309
- He´s the father, isn´t he?
- Yes, Kurt´s the father.

359
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:47,118
But it wasn´t working out,
so I dumped him.

360
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:50,058
You´re gonna raise this baby
all by yourself?

361
00:07:50,161 --> 00:07:53,927
I´m gonna go wait in the car
with Ben, all right?

362
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:56,125
That´s so typical of her.

363
00:07:56,234 --> 00:08:00,193
She´s not thinkin´ about her future.
How´s she gonna get by with a baby?

364
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:02,865
Well, she brought this
upon herself.

365
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:05,733
What?

366
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:20,883
- Hello.
- Hi, Pop.

367
00:08:20,992 --> 00:08:23,517
Sneaking away in
the middle ofthe night?

368
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,994
l´m veryupset withyou.
Dr.Johnson went...

369
00:08:26,097 --> 00:08:28,361
to a great deal oftrouble
to get you thatjob.

370
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,095
- I´m sorry, okay?
- Sorry?

371
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:35,639
You are coming back now! And
you will regard that as a command!

372
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,867
You´re usually so levelheaded...

373
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,207
andyoupulla stunt like this,
lam so surprisedatyou.

374
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,179
You workedso hard. Areyou
gonna startslacking offnow?

375
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:04,128
What are you writing there?

376
00:09:04,235 --> 00:09:05,896
Stuff.

377
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:13,242
Are you mad at me or something?

378
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,869
Why would I be mad at you?
I don´t even know you.

379
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:23,153
- No!
- Oh, no, it sounds bad.

380
00:09:23,254 --> 00:09:26,087
Look at all that smoke.

381
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,234
What´s wrong with it, Ben?

382
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,502
It´s the head gasket, I think.

383
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:47,339
- Give me your shirt.
- Here.

384
00:09:49,313 --> 00:09:51,474
Whoa! What are you doing?

385
00:09:51,582 --> 00:09:53,880
Nobody touches this except
for specialists and myself.

386
00:09:53,985 --> 00:09:56,818
Because it´s an antique
and I don´t want people to--

387
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:01,187
- It´s your radiator.
- No, it´s the head gasket.

388
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:06,924
No, your radiator´s cracked.
What year it this? ´73.

389
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:10,762
Oh, that´s like 350,
plus labor.

390
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,671
Great! Great!

391
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:26,483
I´m hungry.

392
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,644
How long does it take
to get a tow truck?

393
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,713
- Ben´s only been gone two hours.
- I´m so hungry.

394
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:37,556
Won´t you stop saying that?
We heard you. You´re hungry.

395
00:10:37,662 --> 00:10:40,187
So what?

396
00:10:44,368 --> 00:10:48,202
We don´t have $350.
Even if he gets a tow truck...

397
00:10:48,306 --> 00:10:50,467
we don´t have enough money
to get the car fixed.

398
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:55,512
I´m gonna be stuck here in--
Where the hell am I? Where am I?

399
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,910
Louisiana.

400
00:10:57,014 --> 00:11:00,472
Stuck in some
butt-hole town, Louisiana.

401
00:11:00,585 --> 00:11:02,644
I am never gonna get to LA
to see Dylan.

402
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:04,915
He´s gonna be so upset.

403
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:07,688
Whatever.

404
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,521
Excuse me?

405
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,652
Could you be more self-centered?

406
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:17,998
- You´rejustjealous.
- What?

407
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:22,562
I´m not blind. I know how girls
like you looked at me in school.

408
00:11:22,673 --> 00:11:25,233
You would´ve given anything
to trade places with me.

409
00:11:25,343 --> 00:11:27,243
Girls like me?

410
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:30,542
I can´t help it if I´m popular,
sojust lay off.

411
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:34,848
Girls like me?

412
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:38,217
I didn´t make the rules, Mimi.
It´s not my fault...

413
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,483
everyone thinks
you´re a trailer-trash skeeze.

414
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:44,223
- Stop it!
- Don´t touch me like that!

415
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,819
- Guys, don´t!
- You´re pregnant!

416
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:49,126
You´re a redneck!

417
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:53,465
Girls! Mimi! Stop!

418
00:11:53,571 --> 00:11:59,737
Stop it! Stop!
I´m so sick ofthe two ofyou...

419
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:02,039
bitching and fighting
every damn second ofthe day!

420
00:12:02,146 --> 00:12:05,047
For once,
would you just shut up?

421
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:08,641
I don´t know why the hell I asked
the two ofyou to come on this trip.

422
00:12:08,753 --> 00:12:10,948
We don´t belong together.

423
00:12:11,055 --> 00:12:13,580
This was a mistake, okay?

424
00:12:16,093 --> 00:12:19,358
I´m sorry, partner,
that´s the best I can do.

425
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:24,931
It´s a cracked radiator.

426
00:12:27,605 --> 00:12:30,472
He said he´d get it ready
by tomorrow.

427
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,566
How will we get the money
to pay for it?

428
00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:37,013
I have an idea.

429
00:12:37,114 --> 00:12:39,173
I´m gonna call my father
and have him come get me.

430
00:12:39,283 --> 00:12:41,251
You´re leaving?

431
00:12:41,352 --> 00:12:43,513
This trip´s over.

432
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:46,351
Wait, I have an idea!

433
00:12:46,457 --> 00:12:49,449
You know what?
I´m sick ofyour ideas, Mimi.

434
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,528
I should´ve known you´d make
a mess ofthis trip.

435
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:56,828
Fine, run home to your daddy,
but don´t try and blame this on me.

436
00:13:05,676 --> 00:13:10,841
Lucy, I haven´t asked you
for anything in a really long time.

437
00:13:10,948 --> 00:13:14,042
But I´m gonna askyou to stay.

438
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:18,212
Please hang up the damn phone
and just stay with us!

439
00:13:18,322 --> 00:13:20,187
Come on, Lucy.

440
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,522
Hello?

441
00:13:26,464 --> 00:13:29,695
I do.
I have a really good idea.

442
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,894
Yeah, it better be good.

443
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,715
Okay, I have something
to say.

444
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:57,556
I know we´re not all getting along,
but tonight´s important.

445
00:13:57,662 --> 00:13:59,960
We really need the money.

446
00:14:00,064 --> 00:14:04,467
So could wejust be civil
and get through this? Okay?

447
00:14:04,568 --> 00:14:06,160
Okay.

448
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:13,335
All right!
Y´all ready?

449
00:14:13,444 --> 00:14:15,378
Yeah.

450
00:14:18,182 --> 00:14:20,548
- That´s cute.
- Thankyou.

451
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,857
Wait.

452
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,294
It´s all the tips
we can get, right?

453
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:33,090
- Mm-hmm.
- So?

454
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:35,097
Ifwe wanna put on a show,
we have to be sexy.

455
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,134
Now you´re talkin´.

456
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:44,701
- Whatcha got?
- Let me wear those feathers.

457
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:47,642
All right, next contestant´s
a brand-new act.

458
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:50,873
And for all tourists that don´t
know how the rules go in my club...

459
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:53,109
here it is, plain and simple.

460
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:55,208
You´re thejudge.
Ifyou hate ´em, tell ´em.

461
00:14:55,319 --> 00:14:57,287
Ifyou like ´em, pay ´em.

462
00:14:57,388 --> 00:14:59,754
We got baskets going around.
Put the money in there.

463
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,917
Be loud, be fair and be generous
ifyou like what you hear.

464
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,222
So, come on, give ´em
a warm welcome.

465
00:15:32,423 --> 00:15:34,618
- They lookyoung.
- It´s past their bedtime.

00:15:57,615 --> 00:16:01,483
- You can do it.
- I thought so, but I can´t.

470
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,577
- Please do it for me.
- You just gotta go do it.

471
00:16:04,688 --> 00:16:07,987
- No, you do it.
- I don´t know if I can.

472
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:11,858

- How much is it?
- Enough for the car and the trip.

501
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,581
Perfect.

00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,720
You wanna come dance with us?

No. We should get outta here before
somebody realizes you´re underage.

504
00:20:02,793 --> 00:20:05,284
Come on, just a
little bit longer, please?

No.

00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:25,573
Yeah. Watch this.

00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:40,256
Move your hands, please.

511
00:20:42,466 --> 00:20:45,993
We´re gonna get a little freaky.
Hey, what´s up, baby? Come on.

512
00:20:46,103 --> 00:20:48,571
- What´s wrong?
- Will you stop it?

513
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:51,971
Excuse me. Hey, I don´t think
she wants to dance.

514
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:55,068
I think she does.
You should mind your own business.

515
00:20:55,179 --> 00:20:58,012
- Will you leave me alone?
- Excuse me. I´m talking to you.

516
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,313
My nose!

517
00:21:06,523 --> 00:21:07,785
Let´s go.

518
00:21:13,497 --> 00:21:15,465
Oh, damn!

519
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,999
Is this livin´ or what?

520
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:19,592
There´s a mini-bar!

521
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:25,364
Y´all, you could swim
in this bathtub!

522
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:28,302
Look, I´m--

523
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,279
I´m not mad at you
for what happened there. Okay?

524
00:21:32,383 --> 00:21:34,214
There´s bathrobes!

525
00:21:35,386 --> 00:21:37,320
- Where are you going?
-Just going out.

526
00:21:39,323 --> 00:21:42,759
Are any ofyou guys tired,
´cause it´s 3:00 a.m. and I´m wired!

527
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,559
- Who wants some of mama´s punch?
- Me, please.

528
00:21:47,664 --> 00:21:50,565
- Madame.
- Madame.

529
00:00:12,618 --> 00:00:15,314
Go, Lucy! Go, Lucy!

530
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:23,184
What are you doing?

531
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:26,423
You go, girl!

532
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:35,800
I have seen one, y´all.

533
00:00:35,908 --> 00:00:39,639
Yeah, but have you touched one?

534
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,009
She has!
Give us the details!

535
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:48,644
It´s always the quiet ones.

536
00:00:48,754 --> 00:00:51,382
Say it loud. Say you
touched one and you´re proud!

537
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,323
Lucy touched one!
She did!

538
00:01:04,203 --> 00:01:07,331
Okay, the best thing
that ever happened to you.

539
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,533
- That´s easy.
- What?

540
00:01:10,843 --> 00:01:13,710
Reaching my goal weight.

541
00:01:13,813 --> 00:01:17,340
Third year at fat camp,
the summer before eighth grade.

542
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:20,851
Wait, that camp you went to
every summer was a fat camp?

543
00:01:24,590 --> 00:00:00,192
Yes, and I loved it.

544
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:02,487
For two months...

545
00:00:02,594 --> 00:00:06,496
my mama wasn´t around
to pick on me for being fat.

546
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:11,097
Being fat isjust
unacceptable to her.

547
00:00:13,038 --> 00:00:16,940
Okay. The worst thing
that ever happened to you.

548
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:19,567
That´s even easier.
Reaching my goal weight.

549
00:00:19,678 --> 00:00:21,407
- You said--
- It turns out...

550
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:25,040
that being prettier
than my mama...

551
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,675
is even more
unacceptable.

552
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,512
Oh,Jesus.

553
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,990
Yep.

554
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:38,222
One morning I woke up,
and she was gone.

555
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,299
Pop really wouldn´t
say anything about it.

556
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,358
I thought she was coming back,
and Pop told me she wasn´t.

557
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:49,100
They fought all the time.

558
00:00:49,207 --> 00:00:52,540
You know, I think
that shejust got fed up...

559
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:55,374
and took off
without even thinking.

560
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,382
And after a while, it was
Just too late to come back.

561
00:01:01,253 --> 00:01:03,778
I know she wants to see me.

562
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,659
She´sjust scared, that´s all.

563
00:01:10,562 --> 00:01:13,929
I´m gonna be so sick later.

564
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:17,263
Mimi, be glad you´re pregnant
and you couldn´t act stupid with us.

565
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,999
That´s not why I don´t drink.
I just don´t see the point in it.

566
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:23,802
So you never partied?

567
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:28,311
Once.

568
00:01:30,482 --> 00:01:32,074
Over Christmas.

569
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:36,843
There was one ofthose parties
at Hemmings Field.

570
00:01:38,757 --> 00:01:41,191
And this guy
was drinking this beer...

571
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:46,128
and I remember
it was in a blue bottle.

572
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:50,167
And I was real mad
at Kurt because...

573
00:01:50,268 --> 00:01:53,931
he blew me offagain
to hang out with his friends.

574
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:58,202
So I had a few beers.

575
00:02:00,045 --> 00:02:02,343
I had more than a few.

576
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:08,277
This guy, you know, he seemed--
He seemed real nice...

577
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:11,446
´cause when I couldn´t walk,
he offered to drive me home.

578
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:19,455
It´s no big deal, Luce.
It happens to girls all the time.

579
00:02:19,564 --> 00:02:22,032
Did you go to the police?

580
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,294
No.

581
00:02:24,402 --> 00:02:27,860
I´m from a trailer park.
I got drunk and got in his car.

582
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:30,999
So, Kurt´s not the father?

583
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,973
I saw this ad in a magazine.

584
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,780
So I called up this lawyer in
Atlanta, and she sent me this stuff.

585
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:43,217
Um, all these pictures
and letters...

586
00:02:43,321 --> 00:02:46,381
ofall these people
who want babies.

587
00:02:46,491 --> 00:02:48,925
- I was supposed to pick one.
- The guy...

588
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:53,524
what was his name?

589
00:02:55,667 --> 00:02:57,692
I don´t know.

590
00:03:00,272 --> 00:03:03,764
Why did we stop being friends?

591
00:03:03,875 --> 00:03:06,708
I don´t know.
People drift apart.

592
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:10,542
Promise me we won´t
drift apart again.

593
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,111
Come here.

594
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:18,722
And where have you been
all night?

595
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:28,199
Thankyou.

596
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,734
For what you did
last night, I mean.

597
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,962
Thanks.

598
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:38,442
Scoot over.

599
00:03:47,652 --> 00:03:49,711
I´m never drinkin´ again. Honest.

600
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:51,812
This burrito is so good.

601
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:54,118
Don´t mention food.

602
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,123
- What are you doing?
- Chilling.

603
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:13,506
- Wake him up.
- Y´all, he´s been driving all day.

604
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:17,672
- We can´tjust stay here.
- We should just let him sleep.

605
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:20,148
- Uh-uh.
- We´ll let him sleep.

606
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:23,687
Lucy, get his keys.

607
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:26,723
He told us we couldn´t drive
his car. I can´t do that.

608
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:29,419
Why not? It´s not like we´re
gonna drive this over a cliff.

609
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:33,190
- It´s stupid to stay here.
- I´ll drive.

610
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:34,822
Get his keys.

611
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:37,834
- Yeah, get his keys.
- Why do I have to get his keys?

612
00:04:37,936 --> 00:04:42,532
Because Kit and I voted
and you lost.

613
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,039
Get the keys.

614
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:46,736
Yeah, Lucy, get his keys.

615
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:58,779
- This is stealing.
- It´s not stealing if he´s in the car.

616
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,324
No, it´s kidnapping.

617
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:10,530
Okay, stop.

618
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:16,499
Oh, I got it.

619
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:27,409
Go, go.

620
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,860
You failed driver´s ed,
didn´t you?

621
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:44,059
Maybe.

622
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:47,832
- Move over.
- Oh, God.

623
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,100
Guys, smile for the camera.

624
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:12,549
Go ahead, turn it on, turn it on.

- Hi! Did you have a good nap?
- Yeah.

638
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:44,426
Stop, stop the car.

639
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:47,471
Don´t be mad. You looked so sweet
when you were sleeping.

640
00:00:47,572 --> 00:00:50,973
- Wejust didn´t wanna wake you.
- Stop the car.

641
00:00:51,076 --> 00:00:53,567
- It´s against the law to park here.
- It´s my car.

642
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:56,272
- We´re almost at an exit.
- Stop the damn car!

643
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,362
- Mimi, go talk to him.
- Uh-uh, you go talk to him.

644
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:24,271
- Nobody´s gonna go talk to him.
- I know, he´s mad.

645
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:27,943
And he has killed before.

646
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:31,447
Mimi, you said
he didn´t kill anyone.

647
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,714
- I said I thought he didn´t.
- Oh, my God.

648
00:01:40,158 --> 00:01:43,059
- It´s okay, I´ll go.
- I´m sorry.

649
00:01:46,965 --> 00:01:48,865
God!

650
00:01:48,967 --> 00:01:51,765
Be careful, Lucy.

651
00:01:57,642 --> 00:02:01,237
- We´re sorry.
- I´ve been in a car full ofchicks.

652
00:02:01,346 --> 00:02:04,509
Do you have any idea what it´s like
being surrounded by girls?

653
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,179
Being a girl yourself,
I know, stupid question.

654
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,951
But I´m a guy, okay?
I´m a guy.Just a guy.

655
00:02:14,059 --> 00:02:18,393
And I have been listening
to girl talk and watching you do...

656
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,896
your girl things for days.

657
00:02:20,999 --> 00:02:23,763
I´m not complaining, ´cause,
let´s face it, I´m outnumbered.

658
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:25,768
But that´s my car.

659
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,839
It´s my car, and it´sjust--

660
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:35,677
It´s the one thing that hasn´t
been taken over by chicks.

661
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:41,044
- Okay?
- Okay.

662
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:15,281
- Ben?
- Yeah?

663
00:03:15,387 --> 00:03:17,582
Were you really in jail?

664
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,926
Yeah, I was.

665
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:24,257
- So you killed a guy?
- What?

666
00:03:25,463 --> 00:03:27,556
Who said I killed a guy?

667
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:31,861
Everybody back home.

668
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,669
Oh, man.
No, I didn´t kill a guy.

669
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:39,369
What did you do then?

670
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:44,972
I was in college, and I get
this call from my stepsister.

671
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:49,918
She wants me to come get her ´cause
my stepdad is beating her up.

672
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,114
My mom can´t stop him, so...

673
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:55,818
I drive home in
the middle ofthe night...

674
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:59,419
and she throws her things out
the window and climbs out...

675
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,431
and then I drive her back
to school in Ohio with me.

676
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:05,025
- And you went tojail for that?
- That´s the thing.

677
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:06,967
There´s this law...

678
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:10,599
against driving a child that´s
not a relative across state lines...

679
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,371
and my stepdad ofcourse
pressed charges.

680
00:04:13,478 --> 00:04:16,311
But, you know, it´s okay.
I only got six months...

681
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:18,644
and I had to stay in Ohio
for a year´s probation.

682
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,186
My sister got to go live
with her mom.

683
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:30,560
You all really thought
I killed a guy?

684
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,630
Yeah.

685
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,802
What were you thinking getting
into a car with a homicidal maniac?

686
00:04:56,888 --> 00:05:00,346
- Why are we stopping?
- You´ll see.

687
00:05:12,003 --> 00:05:15,166
- Mimi, you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I´m fine.

688
00:05:19,644 --> 00:05:21,578
Look.

689
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:28,415
It´s like you have to whisper.

690
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:32,088
Hello!

691
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:45,124
Man. We gotta make time. The next
hotel is still an hour away.

692
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:48,967
Ben, do you have enough
sleeping bags for all of us?

693
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:51,106
You serious?

694
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,837
You really want to camp here?

695
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:55,242
Yeah.

696
00:05:57,348 --> 00:05:59,441
It sounds like fun.

697
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:05,513
You gotta keep your thumb
on the outside like this.

698
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,289
Right. Now, the trick is...

699
00:06:09,394 --> 00:06:12,852
you don´t want to let him know
that you´re gonna hit him.

700
00:06:12,964 --> 00:06:16,525
Maybe like look away first.

701
00:06:16,634 --> 00:06:20,832
And then, when he least expects it,
you throw your whole body into it.

702
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,510
What are you doing to her?

703
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:29,512
I´m teaching her how to fight
because every girl...

704
00:06:29,614 --> 00:06:32,481
should know how
to throw a decent punch.

705
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:33,983
That was decent.

706
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:36,019
I´m gonna go to bed.

707
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,953
I´m gonna go to the ladies room.
Where is it again?

708
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:41,958
Third bush after the rock
over there.

709
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,426
- This one?
- That one, yeah.

710
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:51,458
What are you always
writing in there?

711
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:55,802
Poems, mostly.

712
00:06:55,907 --> 00:06:58,432
Can I hear one?

713
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:03,542
Okay. One.
But you can´t laugh.

714
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,548
´´I used to think I had
the answers to everything...

715
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:14,056
but now I know that life
doesn´t always go my way.

716
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:18,026
It feels like I´m caught in the
middle, and that´s when I realize...

717
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:21,530
that I´m not a girl,
and not yet a woman.

718
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:25,399
All I need is time,
Just a moment that´s mine.

719
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:28,802
And while I´m in between,
I´m not a girl.´´

720
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,643
I liked it.

721
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,338
Really?

722
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,574
Yeah, really, I like it.

723
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:46,587
- What?
- You got ash on your face.

724
00:07:46,691 --> 00:07:48,716
- Where?
- I´ll get it.

725
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:50,726
There.

726
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:01,366
- What´s wrong?
- What happened?

727
00:08:01,472 --> 00:08:03,736
Something bit my ass.

728
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:06,833
- Let me see.
- It´s a snake bite.

729
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,845
No, Mimi,
that´s a mosquito bite.

730
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,849
Don´t look!

731
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,352
- How could I not? It´s nothing.
- But it could´ve been a snake.

732
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,184
All right! We are outta here
at the crack ofdawn.

733
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,850
Nothing´s biting my ass.

734
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:26,757
So we´ll be in Tucson today?

735
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:29,731
- Around 4:00, I think.
- Are you nervous?

736
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:33,668
Should I call and tell her I´m
coming, or should I just show up?

737
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:36,763
- I should just show up, right?
- Surprise is always better.

738
00:08:36,874 --> 00:08:40,037
She´s gonna be
real happy to see you.

739
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,668
lhopeso.

740
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,996
You´ll call and tell me everything
about the audition, right?

741
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:03,329
-You could still come with us.
-We don´t leave town until tomorrow.

742
00:09:03,434 --> 00:09:05,561
I´ll be fine, okay?

743
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,798
You know where we´re staying
ifyou need us.

744
00:09:09,941 --> 00:09:12,136
Bye.

745
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:18,172
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

746
00:09:18,282 --> 00:09:20,443
I guess this is it.

747
00:09:23,321 --> 00:09:25,255
I guess, yeah.

748
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,324
What?

749
00:09:33,297 --> 00:09:36,198
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

750
00:00:04,677 --> 00:00:06,577
Can I help you?

751
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:09,671
It´s me, Mama-- Lucy.

752
00:00:12,118 --> 00:00:13,710
Come in.

753
00:00:27,433 --> 00:00:29,230
You have a really nice house.

754
00:00:29,335 --> 00:00:31,599
Thankyou, Lucy.

755
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:47,746
Tucson seems like
a really nice city.

756
00:00:47,853 --> 00:00:49,684
It is.

757
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:00,192
Can I askyou
why you´re here, Lucy?

758
00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:03,320
Can I askyou
why you´re here, Lucy?

759
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:06,831
I wanted to see you.

760
00:00:06,932 --> 00:00:08,923
And why was that, Lucy?

761
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:12,535
Well, you´re my mother.

762
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,540
Why do you keep
saying my name like that?

763
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:32,682
Hold on a moment.

764
00:00:40,432 --> 00:00:42,593
Hello?

765
00:00:42,701 --> 00:00:45,226
Sweetie, tell Joey´s mommy I said
you could swim for another hour...

766
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,202
ifyou put on more sunscreen.

767
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:49,205
I don´t want you to burn.

768
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:52,401
Daddy will pickyou up at 5:00.
I love you.

769
00:01:01,419 --> 00:01:05,947
- I have brothers?
- Well, yes.

770
00:01:06,057 --> 00:01:10,221
- How old are they?
- Ten and seven.

771
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:14,064
Do they know about me?

772
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:21,463
Lucy, I think we need
to have a talk.

773
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,544
Whoa
Wait, seven, eight.

774
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:31,548
Five, six--

775
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:49,765
Come on in. Here.

776
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:51,768
- What happened?
- What´s wrong?

777
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,668
- Get some towels, please?
- I´m fine.

778
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:57,936
So, Luce, you got to see
your mom, right?

779
00:01:58,043 --> 00:02:02,275
- Yeah, I saw her.
- And what happened?

780
00:00:05,011 --> 00:00:07,241
just thought you might want
some dry clothes.

781
00:00:07,346 --> 00:00:09,246
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

782
00:00:12,251 --> 00:00:14,151
I´m fine.

783
00:00:14,253 --> 00:00:16,153
I´m okay.

784
00:00:19,692 --> 00:00:21,956
I know.

785
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:25,829
Really, I´m okay.

786
00:00:08,233 --> 00:00:10,861
What happened?

787
00:00:17,042 --> 00:00:18,942
She said...

788
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:22,412
that she never wanted me.

789
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:32,586
She said that my father
made her have me...

790
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:37,186
and that I was
Just a mistake.

791
00:00:56,214 --> 00:00:59,115
I look like her, you know?

792
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:04,182
I have her eyes and her hands.

793
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:06,519
It´s her loss, Luce.

794
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:09,993
It´s weird though, you know?

795
00:01:11,763 --> 00:01:13,663
I don´t have a mother.

796
00:01:13,765 --> 00:01:15,494
Well, you have us.

797
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,329
Yeah.

798
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,550
Trying to call your dad?

799
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:40,784
I can´t.
I will in a minute.

800
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,553
You got that poem
you read me?

801
00:01:43,628 --> 00:01:45,721
- Yeah.
- Can I see it?

802
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,889
Yeah, sure.

803
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:51,127
It´s right here.

804
00:01:54,806 --> 00:01:56,330
What are you doing?

805
00:01:58,143 --> 00:02:00,907
Stop worrying so much.
Come on. I made you something.

806
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:02,343
Okay.

807
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:10,019
This is my surprise?

808
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:12,214
Wouldn´t it be sad if it was?

809
00:02:12,324 --> 00:02:14,884
Like if I just totally sucked
at cheering people up.

810
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,429
I wrote some music
foryour poem.

811
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,993
Will you play it for me?

812
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,003
Will you sing?

813
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:35,378
just use this part
as the chorus.

814
00:02:48,727 --> 00:02:50,456
- Yeah.
- Like that?

815
00:00:11,317 --> 00:00:14,980
Go my way
Like that?

816
00:00:17,223 --> 00:00:21,250
lt feels like l´m caught
in the middle

817
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,260
A little low there.

818
00:00:23,362 --> 00:00:27,890

Don´t even! Don´t.

842
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,489
- I can´t believe we´re here.
- I know.

843
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:22,031
Ben, you know, there are
a lot ofcolleges here in L.A.

844
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:27,633
Hey, what if I didn´t go back?

845
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:31,607
I could go to school here.
I mean...

846
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,079
why don´t I do something
for me for once, you know?

I wanna stay.

848
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,150
I´m gonna stay.

849
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:44,921
Good.

850
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:48,288
Look how happy she is.

851
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:58,501
Fill this out, turn it in over
there. The audition is in six days.

852
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:00,833
Wait. Where do we turn it in?

853
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:03,931
You turn it in over there.

00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:06,169
Fill this out--

855
00:03:06,278 --> 00:03:09,213
- What about music?
- You know what?

856
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,579
I´ll get some flyers printed up.
I know a few guys in L.A.

857
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:15,380
I´ll try to put a band together,
and I´ll see you at the hotel.

858
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,923
- Okay. Great.
- Hey, where you going?

859
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:33,627
Baby? Hi, it´s me!
Guess where I am.

860
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:35,638
L.A.!

861
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:40,074
Okay. All right.
Then I´ll come to you.

862
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,247
All right.
Then how ´bout tonight?

863
00:03:47,652 --> 00:03:50,052
Then how ´bout
tomorrow morning?

864
00:03:52,724 --> 00:03:55,818
Dylan, I´m in Los Angeles!

865
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:58,555
I came to see you!

866
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:02,565
Fine.

867
00:04:03,601 --> 00:04:05,660
What am I gonna say?
Fine.

868
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:09,706
Me too.

869
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,315
He´s really busy with finals
and all. Yeah.

870
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,114
We´re fine.

871
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,151
So who wants to go sightseeing?

872
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:31,092
- I do!
- Okay! All right. Lucy?

873
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,261
I´m kinda tired.

874
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,696
Yeah, I´m pretty beat.

875
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:42,295
Well, I need you.
We can´t drive your car, remember?

876
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:46,004
Don´t wreck it.

877
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:48,102
All right!

878
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,216
Wait, we´re on Melrose--

879
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:03,453
I thought we were going
to see the Hollywood sign.

880
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:07,361
- We will.
- But I think it´s back that way.

881
00:05:07,465 --> 00:05:10,730
I know. But we´re gonna
make a stop first, okay?

882
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,334
Kit, you can
see Dylan tomorrow.

883
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:18,499
- Kit, come on. Let´s go back.
- No.

884
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,910
- Kit, let´s go back. Please!
- No! I want to see him now.

885
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:39,729
Are you sure?

886
00:05:40,765 --> 00:05:42,699
Yeah.

887
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,909
Kit, lreallyshould wait
in the car.

888
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:31,848
- How do I look?
- You look really great.

889
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:34,180
Don´t you guys want
to be alone together?

890
00:06:36,054 --> 00:06:39,785
I want you with me.
Come on.

891
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:52,468
- Surprise!
- Honey.

892
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,300
Hi! Oh, baby.

893
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:57,806
Kit-Kat, I thought we were
gonna make plans tomorrow.

894
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:01,640
Oh, I know. I just really wanted
to see you. This is my friend, Mimi.

895
00:07:04,516 --> 00:07:07,007
You two know each other?

896
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:09,143
Yeah. From school.
Right, Mimi?

897
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:12,417
- Right.
- Yeah.

898
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:18,159
Oh. Well, aren´t you gonna
invite us in?

899
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:21,994
Yeah, I would, Kitty-Kat, but I´ve
got this friend here, and he´s--

900
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,931
you know, he´s really upset,
and we´re supposed to, like...

901
00:07:24,035 --> 00:07:26,026
you know,
hang out or whatever.

902
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,635
Do you need money for the pizza?

903
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:35,302
- Your friend sounds really upset.
- Wait, Kit, hold on.

904
00:07:36,714 --> 00:07:40,343
- Oh, God.
- Who´s she?

905
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,788
We´re supposed to be
getting married.

906
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:48,717
We´re supposed to be
getting married.

907
00:07:48,826 --> 00:07:51,624
I was-- I was gonna tell you,
I just, you know...

908
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:54,027
didn´t want to do it
over the phone.

909
00:07:54,132 --> 00:07:55,531
Dylan, you gave me a ring.

910
00:07:55,633 --> 00:07:58,568
You proposed and gave me a ring!

911
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,365
Kit, I mean,
I´m sorry, you know?

912
00:08:08,246 --> 00:08:10,544
Oh, my God.

913
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:20,089
It was Dylan, wasn´t it?

914
00:08:21,726 --> 00:08:24,251
It was you.
You were the guy at Christmas.

915
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:28,321
- Wasn´t it? It was him, huh?
- What are you talking about?

916
00:08:28,433 --> 00:08:32,597
That night when you came over,
you had that rip in your shirt.

917
00:08:32,704 --> 00:08:36,504
- That was the night that he--
- Kit, what is your problem here?

918
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:41,170
- Kit, I have to go.
- No, Mimi, come back here.

919
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,010
I want him to admit it.
Admit it!

920
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:48,347
You´re getting all worked up
over nothing, Kitty-Kat.

921
00:08:50,021 --> 00:08:53,115
My name is not Kitty-Kat.
I am not your pet!

922
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:24,553
Hello?

923
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:43,773
- Excuse me, where´s the phone?
- It´s right over there.

924
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,150
Yeah, can I make
a collect call, please?

925
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,998
They said I lost the baby.

926
00:10:16,974 --> 00:10:18,839
´´Lost it.´´

927
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:23,209
Like it was my keys
or something.

928
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,041
Isn´t that the stupidest
damn thing you´ve ever heard?

929
00:10:33,357 --> 00:10:35,450
I´d decided to keep her.

930
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:41,197
I was standing on the beach...

931
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:46,202
and my toes were
in the Pacific Ocean...

932
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,506
and she kicked.

933
00:10:53,144 --> 00:10:55,169
It was like this sign.

934
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:58,740
Don´t touch me, Luce.
I´m already crying.

935
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,045
Okay.

936
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,414
I would have made a good mom.

937
00:11:14,265 --> 00:11:16,597
just what were you thinking,
running away...

938
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:19,534
with a pregnant girl!

939
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,537
Lucy, I´m waiting
for an answer.

940
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,199
Do you know what it took
to come here?

941
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,607
I had to take cash out ofsavings
for plane fare and hotel.

942
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:31,239
I worked hard to earn that money
foryour college education.

943
00:11:31,349 --> 00:11:32,714
I´m sorry.

944
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:42,252
So you made a mistake.
I understand.

945
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,026
Everybody makes mistakes.
You´re forgiven.

946
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:50,498
I´m gonna take you girls back
to where you belong...

947
00:11:50,601 --> 00:11:53,331
and we´ll forget about
this whole crazy thing, all right?

948
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:55,337
Okay.

949
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:57,373
Who´s that boy you were with?

950
00:11:57,475 --> 00:12:00,774
How old is he anyway? Is he the one
who put the crazy idea in your head?

951
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:06,614
Hejust gave us a ride.

952
00:12:06,717 --> 00:12:08,947
That´s all.

953
00:00:04,835 --> 00:00:07,497
Hey, sorry it took me so long.
We got a band.

954
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:12,099
- What are you doing?
- Packing.

955
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:16,771
My father says I have
to move to his hotel, so--

956
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:20,749
Until the audition?
How are we gonna rehearse?

957
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:23,115
I´m not going to the audition.

958
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,354
Look, I have to
go back with him, okay?

959
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:36,895
Ben, he´s my father, okay?

960
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:38,730
I just can´t--

961
00:00:38,836 --> 00:00:43,705
And with everything happening
with Mimi, I just think I should go.

962
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,244
- No, I get it.
- Don´t be like that.

963
00:00:50,347 --> 00:00:52,315
I get it. It´s okay.

964
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:55,341
It´s fine.

965
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:37,458
Did you see
how fast he went down?

966
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:43,830
It´s ´cause you threw your body
into that punch, like I taught you.

967
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:49,132
You did really good.

968
00:01:52,443 --> 00:01:53,933
Hey, come here.

969
00:01:55,412 --> 00:01:57,141
Thankyou.

970
00:02:02,353 --> 00:02:05,914
- I´m sorry.
- It´s okay.

971
00:02:06,023 --> 00:02:07,923
It´s not your fault.

972
00:02:22,973 --> 00:02:24,531
Got it?

973
00:02:31,048 --> 00:02:33,516
I can´t believe
this trip is over.

974
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:36,745
I know. God, doesn´t it feel like
we left home a million years ago?

975
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:38,754
Yeah.

976
00:02:40,357 --> 00:02:44,418
- Hey, y´all, thanks.
- For what?

977
00:02:44,528 --> 00:02:48,862
For coming on this trip with me.
Thankyou.

978
00:02:51,435 --> 00:02:53,733
Mimi and I were talking...

979
00:02:53,837 --> 00:02:54,997
and we were thinking--

980
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:57,733
That you need to stay
and go to the audition.

981
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:00,332
Guys, I can´t do that.

982
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:02,469
- I can´t.
- You´ve got to.

983
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:05,377
Kit and I voted, and you lost,
so you´ve got to go.

984
00:03:10,621 --> 00:03:14,022
All right, baby,
ready to head home?

985
00:03:14,124 --> 00:03:17,560
- I´m coming.
- Ladies...

986
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:19,219
let´s roll.

987
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:24,524
Come on, let´s go.

988
00:03:28,872 --> 00:03:30,772
We tried.

989
00:03:33,377 --> 00:03:34,605
Here you go, buddy.

990
00:03:34,711 --> 00:03:37,111
- Thankyou, sir.
- I´ll take that, sweetie.

991
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,217
Good-bye, Lucy.

992
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:49,724
Good-bye.

993
00:04:22,192 --> 00:04:27,129
It´s gonna feel good
to get back home, won´t it?

994
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:28,789
Look, honey...

995
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:32,863
I´m sorry I yelled at you.

996
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,599
I wasn´t angry at you.
I was angry at what you did.

997
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:38,732
- Okay?
- Okay.

998
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:51,849
I don´t want to be like her.

999
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:55,618
We´ll just get back home, and
everything´ll be back to normal.

1000
00:04:55,726 --> 00:04:57,694
You just wait and see.

1001
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:01,464
Don´t make me do
what she did.

1002
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:07,932
Don´t make me run.
just let me go, okay?

1003
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:22,341
What are you--

1004
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:24,579
