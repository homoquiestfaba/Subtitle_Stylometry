00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:02,428
[Narrator]
You know, there's
something special

2
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,530
about autumn
in New England.

3
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,498
When the beautiful fall leaves

4
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:08,067
color the countryside,

5
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:10,269
everyone knows
that the time has come

6
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,671
for the annual
cranberry harvest.

7
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:15,407
And the cranberry growers
gather their berries

8
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:17,843
for Thanksgiving
celebrations everywhere.

9
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:19,945
But their work
is far from over,

10
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,215
because as autumn
turns to winter,

11
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,684
people everywhere
prepare their tables

12
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,352
for yet another great feast,

13
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,221
the Christmas feast.

14
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:35,194
And so, as Jack Frost blows

15
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:37,162
and the air grows cold,

16
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,198
the bog freezes over

17
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,133
to protect
its precious vines.

18
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,901
[wind blowing]

19
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,503
Now, thoughts of the harvest

20
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,939
give way to the pleasures
of winter.

21
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,708
And in the little town
of Cranberry Port,

22
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,977
as in towns and villages
the world over,

23
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:54,613
that can only mean
one thing.

What shape shall we use next?

00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:34,646
You choose, Maggie.

51
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:37,749
Hmm, they all make such
beautiful cookies.

52
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:39,084
I don't know
which one to pick.

53
00:03:39,119 --> 00:03:41,086
[Man]
Get off my pond,

54
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,121
you beastly brats!

55
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:45,557
Oh, no.
Here we go again.

56
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:46,925
Oh, dear.

57
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,294
If I've told you kids once,

58
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,164
I've told you
a thousand times,

59
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:56,668
no skating on my pond!

60
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,971
Uh-oh. Here comes
old man Grape.

61
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,072
We better run for it!

62
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:02,774
You better run,
you little runts!

63
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,943
Because when I get
my hands on--

64
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:07,980
[grunts, shouts]

65
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,514
Uh-oh.

66
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,782
[groans]

67
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,685
Ah!

68
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,520
He looks hurt.
Oh, this is bad.

69
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:16,555
Think he's alive?

70
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,057
[grunts]
Oh, kids.

71
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,493
I hate kids!

00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:22,494
[grunts]

73
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,997
Are you hurt,
Mr. Grape?

74
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:29,534
I said, are you hurt,
Mr. Grape?

75
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,736
[shouts]

76
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,272
I'll be very well, indeed,

77
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,874
when you get off my pond!

78
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,843
You mean bog,
don't you, Grape?

79
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:38,877
My bog!

80
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,050
Now, look here, Whiskers.

81
00:04:45,085 --> 00:04:46,752
If I've told you once,

82
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,087
I've told you
a thousand times,

83
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:50,522
this is my pond,

84
00:04:50,557 --> 00:04:52,991
and you, sir,
are trespassing.

85
00:04:53,027 --> 00:04:54,826
And that goes
for all of you.

86
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:56,028
Now shoo!

87
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,963
And as I've told you

88
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,165
2,000 times, Mr. Grape,

89
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,901
this most certainly
is not a pond.

90
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,536
This is a bog,

91
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,104
a cranberry bog,

92
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,907
and it is my cranberry bog.

93
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,208
Balderdash!

94
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,710
Balderdash, indeed.

95
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,645
My father grew cranberries

96
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,580
from this bog before me,

97
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,382
and his father before him.

98
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:21,153
So I will thank you to leave
my property at once.

99
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,788
I will do no such thing.

100
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,323
You know very well

101
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,591
that this pond belongs to me.

102
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:28,694
Now remove yourself, sir,

103
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,796
or I shall have no choice

104
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,664
but to bring the sheriff
to do the job.

105
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,867
Gentlemen!
Stop this arguing at once!

106
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:37,035
[both]
Uh-oh.

107
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,638
I will have no more
of this bickering.

108
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,040
Imagine, it's almost
Christmas Eve

109
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:43,909
and this is the way
you behave.

110
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,811
But he--
But nothing, sir!

111
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:47,646
Why, it's positively
shameful.

112
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,614
[both]
Yes, ma'am.

113
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,951
Now, why don't each of you
enjoy a cranberry cookie,

114
00:05:52,986 --> 00:05:55,454
while we discuss
this matter like adults?

115
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:58,223
[chuckles]
Hmm, I don't mind if I do.

116
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,658
I hate cookies!

117
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,395
And now, if you would all
just leave my pond--

118
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,696
Bog!
Pond!

119
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,098
Bog!
Pond!

120
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,699
Bog!
Enough!

121
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:10,669
This must be settled
once and for all.

122
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,038
Now each of you will
return to your home

123
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,573
and search your papers

124
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,441
for the deed
to your property.

125
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:17,676
Then we shall see

126
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,378
just who is
the rightful owner

127
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,812
of this bog.

128
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:21,813
Pond.

129
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:22,914
[grunts]

130
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,417
Have I made myself clear,
gentlemen?

131
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,386
[both]
Yes, ma'am.

132
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,254
Very well.
Come now, Maggie.

133
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,790
Bye-bye, Mr. Whiskers.

134
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:32,891
Good-bye, Maggie.

135
00:06:32,926 --> 00:06:34,760
Good-bye, Mr. Grape.

136
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,061
[stammering]

137
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,196
Good-bye, indeed!

138
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,298
[muttering]

139
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,501
Ah!

140
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:47,706
[muttering]

141
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,541
Ah, there we go.

142
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,047
Ah, home sweet home.

143
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,384
Now, where did
I put that deed?

144
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,790
Oh! Balderdash!

145
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,658
Not a word of it anywhere.

146
00:07:06,693 --> 00:07:08,427
What am I to do?

147
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,329
If the pond is not
mentioned in my deed,

148
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:14,032
is it possible that Whiskers
might find mention of it

149
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,667
in his own papers?

150
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,537
Why, that would be...

151
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:19,838
a disaster!

152
00:07:19,873 --> 00:07:22,040
With no claim to the pond,

153
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,942
I'd never know
a moment's peace

154
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,610
on a winter's day.

155
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:29,681
Children skating
and laughing,

156
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:32,818
day and night,
night and day.

157
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:37,122
It's-- It's unthinkable!

158
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:42,461
Of course, if Whiskers were
unable to locate his deed,

159
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:45,564
then he could not claim
the pond as his own.

160
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,066
Yes! That's it!

161
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:52,938
I'll see to it that Whiskers
shall never locate his deed.

162
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,774
Nobody's going
to take my pond,

163
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,744
or my name
isn't Cyrus Grape!

164
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,013
[laughing]

165
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,784
Yah!

166
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:11,923
Oh, dear.

167
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,092
Think, Whiskers.
Think!

168
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,795
Now, if you were me,

169
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,464
where would you
have put those papers?

170
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,366
I-- Oh, wait!

171
00:08:21,401 --> 00:08:23,869
[chuckles]
I am me.

172
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:28,206
Eh. And I still don't
know where they are.

173
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:31,776
Hmm, now that just
might be the answer.

174
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:33,144
Oh, yes, yes.

175
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,915
I'm quite sure I placed
the papers inside the--

176
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,918
[yelping]

177
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,021
[quack]
In the closet.

178
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,055
Ouch.

179
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:47,559
[chuckling]

180
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,928
This is too easy.

181
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:54,165
How could anyone find
anything in that mess?

182
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,067
[gasps]
What's this?

183
00:08:56,103 --> 00:09:00,972
D'oh! Oh, it's that
confounded girl!

184
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,240
Uh! Ugh.

185
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:03,475

00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:25,510
My job here is complete,
and I shall be on my way.

363
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,246
[cackling]

364
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:29,914
[coughing]

365
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,516
Is everyone all right?

366
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,551
[coughing]

367
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,920
I-- I think so.

368
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:39,857
Well, then, I suppose
I'd best begin packing my bags.

369
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,292
What's this?

370
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:45,163
Uh, I don't know.

371
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:48,900
It must have fallen
out of the floorboards.

372
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,235
Hmm. "Official paper."

373
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:52,770
I wonder if--
Well...

374
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,372
are we going
to lollygag about?

375
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,873
Or are we going
to get to work?

376
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:59,177
But my sister will be here
in just a few hours.

377
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:01,512
It simply cannot be done.

378
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:03,948
I'm afraid
it's the city for me.

379
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:06,084
Come on, Mr. Whiskers.

380
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,418
It's Christmas.

381
00:18:07,454 --> 00:18:10,121
Anything can happen
at Christmas. See?

382
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:12,557
The Christmas tree
is still standing.

383
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,225
Anything can happen.

384
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,195
Well, I suppose so,
my dear.

385
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,730
But it's going
to take a miracle,

386
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,266
a Christmas miracle.

387
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,269
Uh, well, then, heh.

388
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:26,838
Here we are.
[nervous chuckle]

389
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:28,673
Home sweet home.

390
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,341
We'll see about that.

391
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,577
Hopefully, your house
is in better condition

392
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,178
than when last I visited.

393
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:37,315
Yes, I certainly hope it is.

394
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:42,920
[gasps]

395
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:46,324
Why, it's--
it's a miracle!

396
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,859
Did you say something,
Brother?

397
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:49,293
Oh, no. Nothing.

398
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,528
Nothing at all.

399
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:53,631
So, how do you
like my house?

400
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,900
My goodness, Brother!

401
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:58,202
It's positively festive!

402
00:18:58,238 --> 00:18:59,437
[chuckling]
Yeah.

403
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,239
Why, thank you, Sister.

404
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,908
Of course, we've yet
to see the inside.

405
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,977
Shall we go in?
Uh, the inside...

406
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,345
I-- Yes, yes.

407
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,248
Ahem.
I suppose we shall.

408
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,687
Well, let me see
if I can get this thing--

409
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,856
Where-- Ah!
Hah, there we go.

410
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,895
[gasps]
Oh, my goodness.

411
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:28,533
Why, Brother, it's--
it's beautiful!

412
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:33,137
Uh, yes, yes,
it actually is, isn't it?

413
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:35,039
[giggling]

414
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,040
What was that?

415
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:38,009
Uh, I didn't
hear anything.

416
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,211
Well, then, Brother,
I think it's time

417
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,947
we discussed your future
living arrangements.

418
00:19:42,982 --> 00:19:44,048
Now, wait.

419
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,551
You've just said
my house looks beautiful.

420
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:50,254
There is no reason for you
to take me to the city!

421
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,357
Who said anything about
taking you to the city?

422
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:56,427
I think you should
stay right here.

423
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:02,033
In fact, your house
is so beautiful,

424
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:06,137
I believe I shall
move in here with you.

425
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:12,577
[snoring]

426
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:16,080
[murmuring]

427
00:20:16,115 --> 00:20:18,015
[snoring]

428
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,951
[muttering]
No children.

429
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,485
[children giggling]

430
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:22,753
[snorts]
Wha-- What--

431
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:26,624
What is that confounded--
oof-- noise?

432
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:27,992
[children laughing]

433
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,161
Oh, this will not do.

434
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,763
This will not do at all!

435
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,299
Get off my pond!

436
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:36,334
Look!

437
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,635
Here we go again.

438
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,303
Whoa, wah!

439
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,138
Wahh-hah!
Ho-ho-oh!

440
00:20:41,174 --> 00:20:42,907
Oh!

441
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:46,077
What are you little
trespassers looking at?

442
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:47,111
[grunts]

443
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:49,213
Now get off my pond
this instant

444
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,083
or I'll have you all
removed by the sheriff.

445
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,818
[Whiskers]
Not so fast, Grape.

446
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:59,257
Sheriff, I demand you arrest
these trespassers.

447
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:00,591
All of them.

448
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,426
And why would
I do that, Mr. Grape?

449
00:21:02,462 --> 00:21:06,130
Because they are trespassing
on my property.

450
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:07,898
I don't believe
you've proven

451
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,468
that this is
your property,
Mr. Grape.

452
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:14,138
And neither have you,
Mr. Whiskers.

453
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:17,074
What's that, dear?
Oh, ahem.

454
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,411
Y-Yes, I believe I do
have that here somewhere.

455
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,313
Ah, yes.
Here it is.

456
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,649
Ahem, let me see.
Ah, here we go.

457
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:27,518
Well, as the party
of the first part--
that's me.

458
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:29,420
[muttering]

459
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,722
What is all this nonsense?

460
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,257
Sheriff, do your job!

461
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,258
[continues muttering]

462
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,459
Ah-hah!
Here it is.

463
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:36,794
A moment, Sheriff.

464
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:38,896
You might wish to have
a look at this.

465
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:41,098
According to this
piece of paper,

466
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,634
this cranberry bog
belongs to Mr. Whiskers.

467
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,804
So, it would seem it is you
who is trespassing, Mr. Grape.

468
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,306
You see?
I-- What?

469
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:49,840
That's ridiculous!

470
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:52,710
There's no way Whiskers
could have found his deed.

471
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:54,779
Not after I-- I--

472
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,580
Oh.

473
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:02,086
Fine.
I'll go quietly.

474
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:08,326
Hey, Mr. Whiskers,
why don't we go ask Mr. Grape?

475
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,895
Ah. Oh, that's
a good idea, Maggie.

476
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:14,231
[Maggie]
Uh, Mr. Grape?

477
00:22:14,267 --> 00:22:17,601
I was wondering
if you might care
to join us.

478
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:21,739
Y-You-- You mean
you're inviting me

479
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,541
to skate with you?

480
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,543
Sure. It's Christmas.

481
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:27,178
You should be having fun.

482
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:29,847
Yes. Please,
Mr. Grape, join us.

483
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:33,150
But nobody has ever
invited me to skate.

484
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,919
Even when I was a child,

485
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:38,756
the other children never
wanted to skate with me.

486
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,825
That's why I would
never allow the children

487
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,593
to skate on my pond.

488
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,128
Bog.

489
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:46,464
Uh, yes, Mr. Whiskers.

490
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,165
Your bog.

491
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,001
I think these would
fit you nicely, Mr. Grape.

492
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,804
[gasps]
Those skates
are-- are for me?

493
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,173
Put them on, Mr. Grape.

494
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,143
[chuckling]

495
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,278
Uh, oh.
All right.

496
00:23:01,314 --> 00:23:02,446
Uh, uh, ooh!

497
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:03,948
[laughing]

498
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,517
Look! I'm skating!

499
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:07,651
Ooh!

500
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:10,955
Sir, I have
just one more thing

501
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,022
to say to you!

502
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:17,194
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Grape.

503
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:21,332
And so it was that Cyrus Grape
became a friend to one and all

504
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,768
in the little town
of Cranberry Port.

505
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:27,972
And now,
when the cold winds blow
and cranberry bogs freeze,

506
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:31,909
you can just bet that it'll be
old Cyrus Grape, himself,

507
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:35,546
that will be the very first
to remind everyone...
