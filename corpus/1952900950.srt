1
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,000
- Connor, breakfast is ready

2
00:01:04,303 --> 00:01:06,903
- Good morning mum
- Good morning
- Hi dad

3
00:01:15,004 --> 00:01:17,904
Lord, thank you for your continuous provisions
upon this family

4
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:21,605
Thank you for the hands that you used to create
this food we're about to eat

5
00:01:22,406 --> 00:01:25,706
We'll be always grateful for the things you give us. Amen
- Amen

6
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:31,607
- So, what are your plans today?

7
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,608
- Not much, just school.

8
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:36,109
- Are you going to the Bible study  later, right?

9
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,110
- I don't know. I don't think I can.

10
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,911
I've to help out with this after school dance.

11
00:01:40,012 --> 00:01:41,212
- What dance?

12
00:01:41,413 --> 00:01:42,813
- The Senior's Prom.

13
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:44,614
- I didn't know you were helping to plan the dance?

14
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:47,015
- I wasn't, but Alex asked me to help, so...

15
00:01:47,216 --> 00:01:48,416
- Alex...

16
00:01:49,617 --> 00:01:52,317
You can tell him you're busy this evening.
You're going to Bible study.

17
00:01:52,418 --> 00:01:53,718
- Dad.....
- No!

18
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:55,219
- Jim...

19
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,320
- I don't like you to hang out with him.
You know that.

20
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,221
- I have already promised him, so...

21
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:01,722
- I don't care why. I've said no!

22
00:02:02,423 --> 00:02:03,823
- Why you always do this?

23
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,124
- He is a homosexual.

24
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,025
- He is a Christian. He is just like us.

25
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:10,726
- No homosexual is a christian or
follower of God for that matter

26
00:02:10,827 --> 00:02:11,727
- Mum...

27
00:02:11,928 --> 00:02:13,228
- I've said no!

28
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:15,429
He's always trying to get you into the wrong things.

29
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,930
- They are kids, Jim...

30
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:19,931
- It’s up to us to decide what they are allowed to do.

31
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:22,732
Alex is struggling and is trying to bring
Connor down with him and

32
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:24,433
I won't that let happen.!

33
00:02:25,134 --> 00:02:28,034
You are not staying after school today. Be home by 3.30 !

34
00:02:28,135 --> 00:02:29,835
- I'm out of here. Bye mum
- Connor...

35
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:44,935
- Okay.I'll talk you later. Bye.

36
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:07,636
- Hi
- Hi

37
00:03:08,237 --> 00:03:09,437
- How are you?

38
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:11,838
- I’m good. How are you?

39
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,839
- I'm good. We haven't talked too much lately...

40
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,440
- Yeah, I've been kind of busy...

41
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:21,241
- Yeah. Me too. I've been planning the dance
and it has been taken up all of my time

42
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:22,442
- I'm sure.!

43
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:26,543
I've got those fliers you wanna me to make you...
- Thank you

44
00:03:32,344 --> 00:03:36,644
- Wow!! this is art.!
- Thanks.

45
00:03:38,645 --> 00:03:40,145
- I've gotta go.

46
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:44,146
- The meeting is about to start. Would you...
maybe you wanna join me?

47
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:46,847
- Not today Alex. I’ve promised this girl
to go to lunch with her.

48
00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:50,748
- If is about you not being gay, it's okay.

49
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:53,349
It's a gay-straight alliance...being straight...

50
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,550
- Alex, I'll get it, okay? I'll talk to  you later

51
00:03:58,051 --> 00:03:59,551
- Hey...

52
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:02,452
- Come on. Do it for me...

53
00:04:04,053 --> 00:04:05,353
Please...

54
00:04:09,054 --> 00:04:11,354
- To all friends, it's already getting started...
- Sorry....

55
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:16,155
Everyone,this is Connor. He helped us on the fliers...

56
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:19,656
- Hey Connor, we appreciate your help.

57
00:04:19,757 --> 00:04:22,657
We've heard a lot about you,
nice to finally meet you.

58
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:25,858
- Yeah, no problem.

59
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:29,559
- So, we're talking about our experience of coming out.

60
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,660
So, what's new with you Matt?

61
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:36,761
- Well, I said I've  came out to my dad last week and

62
00:04:36,762 --> 00:04:39,062
he hasn't said more than two words to me

63
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:41,763
He left this book on my bed and it's called

64
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,364
"Men who struggle with their sexual identity"

65
00:04:45,765 --> 00:04:47,265
You know, he doesn't get that

66
00:04:47,466 --> 00:04:49,166
he is not gonna change who I am.

67
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:50,967
I am gay and...

68
00:04:51,568 --> 00:04:54,568
I'm not gonna start pretending to like girls again and

69
00:04:55,469 --> 00:04:57,369
do that all thing because...

70
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:01,370
you know, when I did that
I was feeling I was living a lie.

71
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:04,871
- So what about you Connor?

72
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,872
This is your first time here.

73
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:09,673
What's your view on homosexuality?

74
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:13,774
- I don't know. I was raised christian, you know, baptist.

75
00:05:14,175 --> 00:05:15,575
My dad is a pastor,

76
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:17,476
so religion, kind has always been a big deal...

77
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:28,677
- What is it now,Jim?

78
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:45,278
So, you've found the paper for the school dance, so what?

79
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,479
He's involved in lot of things at school.

80
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,880
It's something most parents would love their kids to be a part of.

81
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:53,881
- It's the gay-straight alliance that he is putting in on.

82
00:05:53,982 --> 00:05:56,082
He is not planning the seniors prom!

83
00:05:57,383 --> 00:06:00,483
- You know Jim, you need to stop accusing him
of doing something wrong.

84
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:03,884
- He lied to us.
Since when  isn't that wrong?

85
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:07,085
- Well, I realize  that and maybe
it's for this exact reason.

86
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:11,786
You know, acting like this is not gonna bring
the two of you any closer together.

87
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:14,287
It only pushes him further away from you, every time

88
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:16,488
It's tearing our family apart.!

89
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:20,589
- You know why I do this.
You know about Alex.

90
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,890
And I've seen them together, Alex and him,

91
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:25,491
I've seen how they act and
it's not normal

92
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:26,992
Do you call this normal?

93
00:06:26,993 --> 00:06:28,693
The fact that he's planning a gay dance?

94
00:06:28,994 --> 00:06:31,594
- Okay, what exactly is normal to you, Jim?

95
00:06:32,995 --> 00:06:35,595
Is it putting on a dress-shirt and a tie and going after church

96
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,796
or putting on a jersey and  some cleats
to go play some sport?

97
00:06:39,797 --> 00:06:41,897
You see, that's your idea of normal Jim,

98
00:06:41,898 --> 00:06:43,198
so everyone else!

99
00:06:43,299 --> 00:06:44,599
- That's what men do, Sarah!

100
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,300
- What men do...

101
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:48,501
..has to show you...nothing never changes...

102
00:06:48,502 --> 00:06:49,802
- What that is supposed to mean?

103
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:52,703
- Okay....

104
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:56,304
Do you remember when Connor was nine years old

105
00:06:56,305 --> 00:06:57,505
and in the baseball team

106
00:06:57,806 --> 00:07:01,506
and season after season you would drag him to sign up again

107
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:03,507
and he could cry and cry and cry.

108
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,308
But what did you do Jim?

109
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:07,609
You forced him to play.

110
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,810
So, what are you gonna do now?

111
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:14,411
What if Connor isn't the child you wanted?

112
00:07:14,612 --> 00:07:16,412
What if he doesn't fit your idea

113
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:18,513
what the perfect son is?

114
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:25,815
- According to them in the Bible, you know,
is pretty much considered a sin.

115
00:07:27,216 --> 00:07:30,616
It's the idea that if you're gay, you've been tempted

116
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,417
and by fire for that temptation

117
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:34,518
is just to fulfill your own greed.

118
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:36,519
Leviticus 18, 22

119
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,220
and 20,13 says:

120
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:42,321
”Thou shall not lie with mankind as with womankind.

121
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:44,722
It is an abomination”

122
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:46,723
- So what your parents said when you came out...

123
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:48,424
- He is not an homosexual, Sarah

124
00:07:48,725 --> 00:07:50,225
- What if he is?

125
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:53,326
- I will not have that in my house or in the church.

126
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:56,527
He is a child of God. 
That is how I've raised him.

127
00:07:56,528 --> 00:08:00,528
- Regardless of who he is or whom he likes, 
he is still our child.

128
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:05,529
You know, you may be able to force him to play baseball,

129
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,830
but you can't  force him to be something he is not!

130
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:23,731
- So Connor, how have you kept this idea

131
00:08:23,832 --> 00:08:25,832
of accepting Alex even knowing he is gay?

132
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,533
Most Christians with your background

133
00:08:28,534 --> 00:08:31,834
just wouldn't be as tolerant and accepting as

134
00:08:31,935 --> 00:08:33,735
you seem to be with Alex

135
00:08:34,336 --> 00:08:36,236
- Well, since they have been good friends for a while

136
00:08:36,237 --> 00:08:38,437
I don't think anything he says 
would change that, right?

137
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:41,338
I mean, he saw the same person he was before.

138
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,339
- Yeah, right!

139
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,340
- God, look at this place.

140
00:08:57,341 --> 00:08:59,741
The grass's got so long since we had been here

141
00:08:59,942 --> 00:09:01,942
- We've been alright.

142
00:09:06,643 --> 00:09:08,043
- Outside what happened....

143
00:09:11,044 --> 00:09:12,544
You know about what I told you,

144
00:09:13,645 --> 00:09:16,045
you know, that I like you...

145
00:09:20,446 --> 00:09:21,746
- It's fine

146
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:24,647
- It doesn’t seem fine.

147
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:27,648
Ever since I've told you, you have been distant with me.

148
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:29,449
- What else do you think was gonna happen Alex?

149
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,950
Of course it's gonna be different.

150
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:33,551
- I don't know.

151
00:09:33,652 --> 00:09:36,052
I've always tried to do everything

152
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:37,953
and I thought was something I should tell you.

153
00:09:38,154 --> 00:09:39,854
- What did you think,that was gonna tear our friendship?

154
00:09:40,655 --> 00:09:42,555
- I know you're unhappy with your life

155
00:09:42,656 --> 00:09:44,156
it is not just about you Alex.

156
00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:47,357
Thank God you don't have to go through […....]now.

157
00:09:48,658 --> 00:09:51,258
Beside you've been were so caught up in this GSA crap

158
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:52,959
that I rarely get to see you anymore.

159
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,860
I mean, what if you get a boy-friend?

160
00:09:56,861 --> 00:09:59,361
You know, how nice...

161
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:01,362
It bothers me.

162
00:10:05,263 --> 00:10:06,863
Certainly, it's a distant lately,

163
00:10:06,964 --> 00:10:09,064
you know it just has been an allergy for me...

164
00:10:09,165 --> 00:10:10,465
- What do you mean?

165
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,966
- That I think I'm gay

166
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,567
- What?

167
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:23,768
- Who else have you told?

168
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:25,669
- Nobody.

169
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,370
Just you.

170
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:31,571
- How did you know?

171
00:10:33,472 --> 00:10:37,572
- Because...I like you too.

172
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,073
I've been worried I wont tell you for ever, but...

173
00:10:43,874 --> 00:10:46,374
. Connor, you don't have to explain

174
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:52,075
- How I'm gonna tell my parents?

175
00:10:52,176 --> 00:10:54,276
My dad will tell me everyday how wrong it is.

176
00:10:55,977 --> 00:10:57,677
- But if this is who you are,

177
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:00,778
it will be perfect!

178
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:03,979
Besides, no matter what,

179
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,780
we'll still be best friends.

180
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:12,581
Wow, let's dance this coming out.

181
00:11:12,682 --> 00:11:14,282
- Alex, come on....

182
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:18,783
I would love to, you know, but I can't.

183
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:20,984
- I know, I understand...

184
00:11:23,285 --> 00:11:24,685
- But I've got something for you though...

185
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:27,386
- Oh, thank you. That’s beautiful..Thank you.

186
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,487
" You and I.

187
00:11:33,288 --> 00:11:35,988
Did you feel my heart beat

188
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:39,189
next to yours in that scene?

189
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,090
You and I,

190
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:49,591
just you and I.

191
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:59,292
And ain't it funny how life turns the tables

192
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:07,893
in our time and you can't rewind?

193
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,894
All the things that felt so right,

194
00:12:11,194 --> 00:12:13,794
I laid it down on the line,

195
00:12:14,395 --> 00:12:19,095
You and I.

196
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:24,496
Did you feel my heart beat next to yours..."

197
00:12:24,597 --> 00:12:27,597
- Are you sure you don't wanna anything?
- No, I'm okay, just turning up

198
00:12:27,598 --> 00:12:29,798
-  Why? Don't wanna miss me too much.
- Yeah.

199
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:47,599
- Are five boxes

200
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,700
- Hey, is not that queer from our school?

201
00:12:50,301 --> 00:12:51,601
Over there .

202
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,002
- Hey you faggot.
- Leave me alone!

203
00:13:00,102 --> 00:13:02,202
- I see you're pretty you little queer
- What do you want?

204
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:04,603
- Shut the fuck up

205
00:13:08,904 --> 00:13:10,304
- Did you like that?

206
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,505
- Let's go

207
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:31,305
- What are you gonna do about it?

208
00:13:31,406 --> 00:13:32,706
- Someone is coming in Duke!

209
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:34,807
- Alex...What the hell man?

210
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,408
- Who are you? His fucking boyfriend?

211
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:41,909
- And what if I am?

212
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,310
- Come on Duke!
- Queers!!

213
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:48,911
- Are you alright? What happened?
- Don't know

214
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:00,712
- Hello?

215
00:14:02,813 --> 00:14:04,213
- What happened?

216
00:14:06,114 --> 00:14:07,414
- Is he alright?

217
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:10,015
- What's going on?

218
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:14,116
- So, can you tell me exactly what happened?

219
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:15,817
- He just came to help me..

220
00:14:17,618 --> 00:14:18,918
- What else?

221
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:23,219
- Connor, what are you doing in here? 
What happened?

222
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,920
- It was nothing. Just some kids wanted to fight.
 It was not a big deal..

223
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:27,921
- Connor, are you alright?

224
00:14:28,122 --> 00:14:30,422
- Connor, you know what did this to you,right?

225
00:14:30,523 --> 00:14:32,323
It's because you were with Alex.
I told you this was gonna happen.

226
00:14:32,324 --> 00:14:33,824
- Dad would you stop?

227
00:14:33,925 --> 00:14:35,525
- No Connor, you listen to me.

228
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,226
You're better than this.
I've raised you better than this.

229
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:39,327
- No! I like Alex.

230
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:41,628
- No,you don't.
- Yes, yeah, I do.

231
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:43,929
- Connor listen to me. You don't like him.

232
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,730
You're confused, you're struggling with yourself. 
You just need help.

233
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:48,831
- Dad, I'm not struggling with this any longer.

234
00:14:48,932 --> 00:14:50,432
That's it, this is who I am.

235
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:52,833
Who is struggling is with you 
trying to understand that.

236
00:14:53,034 --> 00:14:54,634
- This has nothing to do with you.

237
00:14:54,735 --> 00:14:57,835
- You can blame anyone you want, 
but this is not Alex's fault.

238
00:14:58,036 --> 00:15:00,136
- Maybe for once you can stop listening 
what the Bible says

239
00:15:00,237 --> 00:15:01,737
or what your friends at church are saying

240
00:15:01,838 --> 00:15:03,938
and start listening to your heart

241
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:06,839
because, maybe, one day
you'll find some answers.

242
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,040
" “Mom and Dad ..."

243
00:15:11,241 --> 00:15:12,241
- Connor...

244
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:14,942
"Don't worry about your son,

245
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:18,143
I'll be OK,

246
00:15:18,644 --> 00:15:22,844
I'll take these days one by one"

247
00:15:24,845 --> 00:15:28,145
- I'll owe you that.
- What?

248
00:15:28,946 --> 00:15:31,046
You've been brave within there.

249
00:15:33,247 --> 00:15:35,847
- I think I'll owe you a dance
- Yeah?

250
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:46,548
At the end of the day all we have is

251
00:15:47,349 --> 00:15:51,049
who we are.

252
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,350
For now

253
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:05,251
I'll choose this life I live

254
00:16:05,552 --> 00:16:12,052
And for now I'll choose to take my hits

255
00:16:12,153 --> 00:16:17,653
Cuz at the end of the day all we have is

256
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:22,054
who we are

257
00:16:22,255 --> 00:16:25,555
