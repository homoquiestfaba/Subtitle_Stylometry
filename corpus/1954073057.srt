Who do you want to live with?

19

good job at convincing the world</i>

Please, can we not hire
any more actresses,

no matter how much
waiting experience they have.

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,011
- Hey, Etta, how's your husband?
- Not dead yet.

36
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,767
Why don't you just slide
29 over to 30?

37
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,683
Because I have a
birthday party at 30.

38
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,330
- How about 15?
- Fifteen is good.

39
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,046
Oh, by the way, your brother called.
He's such a flirt.

40
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,929
- Hello, sir. How are you?
- Hi.

41
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,081
That table finished their dessert,
paid their bill

42
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,525
and they've been sitting there
for a half-hour!

43
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,365
We're actually setting
a new table for you right now.

44
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,125
- Good.
- Okay? Thank you. I'm so sorry.

- Word up.
- Thank you.

47
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,007
We're slammed, Trey, talk fast.

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,004
Well, I don't have anywhere to sit,
so tell me while I'm standing.

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,127
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Look!

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,090
- Whoa! Really?
- I know!

51
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,045
I think you mean "congratulations"?

52
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,361
Yes. Congratulations.

53
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,562
The phone hasn't stopped.
One sec.

54
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,205
Hi, Mom!

55
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,850
I know!
I'm so excited.

56
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,046
Wanna get high?

57
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,364
No, I don't wanna get high.
Married?

58
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,410
- What's it been? Three or four months?
- Holy shit, yeah, it has been.

59
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,164
- Yeah.
- it's been like four months!

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,801
Yeah. That's a huge decision.

61
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,570
Honestly, I just came up
with it yesterday.

62
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,971
We were at Costco

63
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,090
and she made the fucking funniest
joke about this DVD display

64
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,400
and I just thought
this is the girl

65
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,562
I want to spend the rest
of my life with, you know?

66
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,762
(STAMMERING) That's great.

67
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,447
Are you sure you're ready for this, man?
I mean, you kind of...

68
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,722
You live in my garage, Trey.

69
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,167
And you don't have
a checkbook.

70
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,089
It just feels right.

71
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,330
- Okay. That's great.
- Thanks, man.

72
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,524
TREY: You're not gonna want to do this,
but could you talk to Mom and Dad?

73
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,080
- About?
- Coming to a wedding.

74
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,761
(BOTH LAUGHING)

75
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,443
You're not having a wedding.
Just do a small thing at City Hall.

76
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,567
One witness, no hassle.

77
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,326
I mean, isn't there some sort of
traditional Japanese thing you can do?

78
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,050
- She's from Palo Alto.
- I know. But like the old country?

79
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,610
She's third generation.

80
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,008
Trey, Mom and Dad
haven't spoken in 20 years.

81
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,971
I know, but if anybody could
get them to, it's you.

82
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,166
They listen to you.

83
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,447
They don't really.
I mean, I patronize them, so...

84
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,251
Look, things have
been pretty good.

85
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,249
We're in a period
of real calm here.

86
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,567
You sure you want
to take that risk?

87
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,246
It's my wedding.

88
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,766
Please. I mean, if there was ever
going to be a day...

89
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,281
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

90
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,725
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

91
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,564
- Oh!
- Okay.

92
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,966
- You're the man.
- Okay.

93
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,681
You are the Best Man.
You get it?

94
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,811
Thanks a lot.

95
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,170
He said okay!

96
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,605
CARTER: All right, guys,
who's going to go higher?

97
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,886
- Me.
- Okay.

98
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,043
Oh, my God, it's so scary.

99
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,885
Don't tell your mom I'm giving you
these, there's no actual juice in them.

100
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,724
(HORN HONKING)

101
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,451
Look who's here. Okay, one,
two, three. Oh, my gosh.

102
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,124
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

103
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,121
Oh, guys, come on.
Whoa!

104
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,362
Hey. How was Rancho De La...
Wherever it was you went?

105
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,091
Oh, it's the greatest. It's a
first-class joint. I had a manicure.

106
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,366
I can see from here.

107
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,487
Bring me my babies.

108
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,210
Mommy! Mommy!

109
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,282
Hi. How were they?

110
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,121
They were good.

111
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,966
Pretty interesting park, though.
A lot of sharp right angles.

112
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,051
This is a very important park.
Do you know I. M. Pei?

113
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,565
His brother comes here.

114
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,562
Carter, I got you something.
These are the greatest hats.

115
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,085
Yeah, the greatest.

116
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,527
- Put it on.
- I will. I just...

117
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,047
Come on, put it on. I wanna see
what it looks like on your head.

118
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,321
HUGH: Carter, on.

119
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,171
Terrific.

120
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,960
- I nailed it.
- SONDRA: it looks great on you.

121
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,168
Hey, Dad,
did you happen to talk to Trey?

122
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,562
Great news, huh?
How about that kid?

123
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,009
Well, he wants to
have a wedding.

124
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,129
Terrific. I told him,
whatever he wants.

125
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,409
Come on, forget the family
of the bride pays for this or that.

126
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,126
It's me, because I might
only do this once.

127
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,484
So you'll go to a wedding
if Mom is there?

128
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,161
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

129
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,161
No. She can have
her own wedding.

130
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,284
Right. But we're probably
not going to have two weddings.

131
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,361
Why not?

132
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,649
I'm gonna throw
a first-class party,

133
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,688
and then your mother
and Captain Fuckface

134
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,286
can rent out a
KFC in Petersburg.

135
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,567
They can charge admission
to cover the fucking cost.

136
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,531
Dad, I'm not asking you to dance
with her. Just be in the same room.

137
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,364
- Carter.
- Dad.

138
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,523
If I ever see that woman,
I'm going to kick her in the balls.

139
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,609
<i>MELISSA: It's just something every
parent dreams of, their child's wedding.</i>

140
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,762
Yeah, I think it's wonderful.
I do.

141
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,810
Yeah, me, too. It's just...
I don't know, it's too bad.

142
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,530
What is?

143
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,001
Oh, it's just too bad
they have to elope.

144
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,969
What? No, no! Absolutely not.

145
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,804
Well, Trey doesn't
have a choice, Mom.

146
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,850
I mean, unless you and Dad
will show up at the same wedding.

147
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,840
I'll elope with them.

148
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,082
Mom, if you go,
it's not an elopement.

149
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,208
- GARY: It's a destination wedding.
- That's right.

150
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,203
And, plus, Dad has to
go and Sondra.

151
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,441
No,no,no,no!

152
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,568
The Cuntessa is not coming
to San Martin.

153
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,281
GARY: Melissa? Will you grab that
penlight in the kitchen drawer for me?

154
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,042
(WHISPERING) He's losing his mind.
Tie it to yourself.

155
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,880
She usually calms down
in 10 to 15 seconds.

156
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,041
Thanks, Gary.

157
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,442
Found it. Sorry.

158
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,524
You know what? I'll go to a
wedding with your father.

159
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,161
- You will?
- Mmm-hmm.

160
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,681
As soon as he pays me
that $485,000 he owes me

161
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,966
for my share of the lake house.

162
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,162
Larry Ellis was waterskiing
there last weekend

163
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,368
and he saw a light on.

164
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,602
Is your father using it?
You know he's not allowed to use it.

165
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,489
Mom, no one's been
there in 20 years.

166
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,961
Because he's renting it!
He's renting it!

167
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,966
Anything he earns on that house,
I get half.

168
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,850
That's in the settlement agreement.
That's how that works.

169
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,367
You know your father's refusing to put it
on the market just to spite me?

170
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,647
That means your father
is stealing from your mother.

171
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,051
That must really bother you.

172
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,202
- I don't...
- How does it not bother you?

173
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,725
No, it doesn't seem to.

174
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,121
Please tell me
you are not your father's son!

175
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,247
What?

176
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,480
Hey.

177
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,125
So here's a bit of news.
Kieko called me.

178
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,686
Oh
yeah?

179
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,445
Yeah. She asked me to be
a bridesmaid. Straighten your back.

180
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,646
Hmm.

181
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,165
I didn't even know
they were getting married.

182
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,447
Yeah, I was going to
tell you about that.

183
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,004
Trey and Kieko have been together,
what, four months?

184
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,131
Yeah, something like that.

185
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,444
And we've been
together how long?

186
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,928
Well, that's kind of apples and
oranges, if you think about it.

187
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,525
It's four years.

188
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,130
Four years. And I don't even have
a key to your apartment.

189
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,451
Look, I've been patient.
Really.

190
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,204
But how long do you
expect me to wait?

191
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,241
Um...

192
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,611
- Oh, my God.
- I totally had you!

193
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,569
- You did. Yeah.
- I had you for a minute.

194
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,563
Jesus.

195
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,404
I'm really excited.
I think it's going to be great.

196
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,122
All right, get up. All right, everybody!
Gloves on, hands up.

197
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,889
They should be $6,
because they are fresh.

198
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,965
- Hey.
- Hey.

199
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,085
Your mom called.

200
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,245
Okay, thanks.

201
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,731
Four times.

202
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,125
Right.

203
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,010
And your dad called, too.
Twice.

204
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,328

Hi. Hey.

223
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,691
I was just thrilled
to hear from you.

224
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,888
- Come on in. This way.
- Thank you.

225
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,442
Sorry it's such a mess,
I've been really busy.

226
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,610
I'm lecturing here and there,
"The Modern Family Dynamic."

227
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,605
And why don't you have a seat
right here. I'll move all this.

228
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,002
- I just came back from Northwestern...
- That's great.

229
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,487
...Louisiana State College.

230
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,800
It's a junior college.

231
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,168
Well, thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

232
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,369
I didn't want to have to explain
everything to someone new.

233
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,090
Well, I haven't seen you
since you were 13, so...

234
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,130
- Yeah, I know.
- So tell me about you.

235
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,010
- What do you do?
- Well, I have a restaurant.

236
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,320
Whitegrass.

237
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,481
- On Temple Street?
- Yeah.

238
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,806
- I've eaten there!
- Great.

239
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,405
I didn't love it,
but I'd try it again.

240
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,851
All right.

241
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,888
And how is your mom?
I always liked her.

242
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,122
- You did?
- Yeah. Very assertive woman.

243
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,603
And your dad, he has a new wife.
Something Nordic? Thor?

244
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,091
- Elka.
- Elka.

245
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,685
Oh, no, no, no.
Elka's gone.

246
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,286
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I didn't know that.

247
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,727
Oh, no, she didn't die.
She just aged.

248
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,167
On to wife number three.

249
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,961
Yeah, Sondra.
Not my cup of anything.

250
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,281
But she does own the building
that my restaurant's in,

251
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,441
so I get a sweet deal on rent.

252
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,889
Oh, good.
So tell me, what brings you here?

253
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,327
Well, my brother is
getting married.

254
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,811
Oh, I love weddings.

255
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,327
And my parents
are being a nightmare already.

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,129
And I've kind of forged
this fragile peace between them.

257
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,326
"A fragile peace"?

258
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,602
They always made
a mess of everything.

259
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,082
Like all holidays,
graduations, funerals.

260
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,605
I remember the funeral incident.

261
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,002
And I maintain that funerals need
to be about the person who died.

262
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,242
Right. And I got smart.
And over the years,

263
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,369
I've started coming up with ways
to avoid situations like this.

264
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,091
Like Thanksgiving. Who am I going
to spend Thanksgiving with?

265
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,642
Well, they think I'm in Honduras building
schools with the US Cares program.

266
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,167
But little do they know, the US Cares
program doesn't exist, so...

267
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,163
Oh. That sounds real.

268
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,210
Yeah, I kind of got it
figured out, but...

269
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,964
I don't know.
This wedding, it's risky.

270
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,010
I guess I'm just looking for some advice.
Someone to talk to super quick,

271
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,560
to figure out how to
survive the next few months.

272
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,167
I can absolutely recommend somebody,
if I could find a pen.

273
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,366
Yeah?

274
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,162
Well, I thought you, just because
you know the whole backstory.

275
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,850
But I'm not a therapist.

276
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,806
But you were my therapist.

277
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,168
Oh, no, no, no.
No. Is that what they told you?

278
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,480
- No.
- Yeah.

279
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,565
I saw you as part of a state-funded study
of the effects of divorce on children.

280
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,961
Your mother was referred to me
by the courts

281
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,122
because of the nature
of your parents' divorce.

282
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,887
- Oh.
- I wrote a book about it.

283
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,770
It was on <i>The New York Times</i>
Best Seller list for 38 weeks.

284
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,961
Oh?

285
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,804
It's in its 14th printing.

286
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,647
Margot Kidder did the audio book!

287
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,970
What was the name
of that book again?

288
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,885
Well, fuck me.

289
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,045
CARTER: Do you think
I walk around like a victim?

290
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,770
I don't think I walk
around like a victim.

291
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,729
Do you think I'm
a negotiator?

292
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,609
Like I'm constantly
trying to keep the peace,

293
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,364
even if there's no
peace to be kept?

294
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,523
I mean, that's actually
written in a sentence.

295
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,887
I mean, that's just bad sentence
construction, in my opinion.

296
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:43,251
Am I living in a shell of insecurity
and approval-seeking?

297
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,166
I don't know.

298
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,326
You know what?

299
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,769
Thank you for this.

00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,248
Huh.
Yeah, I remember that book.

308
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,970
It's funny, I don't.

- So...
- Mom.

311
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,364
- What?
- Why?

312
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,802
Your father was running around

313
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,360
with every 25-year-old
coat check girl in the city.

Mom.

315
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,848
And you really needed
to talk to somebody.

316
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,048
Relax. She didn't use
your real name.

317
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,441
You were like Robert or something.

318
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,851
- Rob.
- it's Rick.

319
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,684
- Rick!
- Rick.

320
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,601
So you read it?

321
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,769
According to this,
Rick is a total disaster.

322
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,365
You do realize that Rick
now owns a successful business

323
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,920
and has employees
who come to him with their problems.

324
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,322
- Mmm-hmm.
- Rick has a beautiful girlfriend

325
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,131
- whom he loves.
- Mmm-hmm.

not the reason you brought me here.

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,525
Mmm, crab.
You know they self-amputate?

335
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,090
Hey, buddy. Look.

336
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,241
Shit!

337
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,845
- Shall I open the wine?
- No!

338
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,490
Yes. Sit down.

339
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,490
Sit, Dad.

340
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,688
Forget it. I'll go.

341
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,286
Fine.

342
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,011
You leave, he wins.

343
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,090
Right. You go. I cleared a very busy
evening to have dinner with my son.

344
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,486
Like I didn't?

345
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,571
(DISHES CLATTERING)

346
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,923
You've destroyed this evening.
What have you done?

347
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,804
This is ridiculous!

348
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,769
Is it? I don't know.
Look around you.

349
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,285
The building is still standing.

350
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,567
You're both in the same room

351
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,122
and somehow the universe
hasn't folded in on itself.

352
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,771
Holy shit. Now, I brought
you both here tonight,

353
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,763
because you've turned
a nine-year marriage

354
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,888
into a hundred-year war.

355
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,961
And I am officially over it.

356
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,123
We're playing by new rules now.
Okay?

357
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,885
Trey is getting married.
There is going to be a wedding.

358
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,962
Now, you don't have to pay for it,
you don't have to organize it,

359
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:00,602
you don't even have to enjoy it.
All you have to do is show up, be civil,

360
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,605
and for one night,
just shut the fuck up.

361
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,681
The drama.

362
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,125
A pain in the ass, he is.

363
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,328
On, my God. (STAMMERING)

364
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,925
You actually agree
on something.

365
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,480
That's fantastic.
This is a great start, you guys.

366
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,281
You sit here, you talk.
You have a good time together.

367
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,840
I ordered the tasting menu
and I paid for it,

368
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,085
so bon appétit!

369
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,529
Oh, and FYI,
I've never been to Honduras.

370
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,120
Have you had your face done?

371
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,966
I gotta tell you, what you did,
that took some balls.

372
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,246
Well, thank you.

373
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,211
Yeah, honestly, I should have
straightened them out years ago.

374
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,204
- It felt good.
- All right. So, what's next?

375
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,441
Well,

376
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,726
full speed ahead.
You plan the wedding you want, Trey.

377
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,689
- Awesome!
- Oh, by the way,

378
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,683
we don't want Morn and Dad
paying for anything, so don't ask.

379
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,445
- Okay.
- Can Kieko's family help out?

380
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,567
- Um...
- Because I'd be happy

381
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,244
to chip in, as well.

382
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,402
- Really?
- Yeah, of course.

383
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,042
(STAMMERING) Dude,
I can't thank you enough.

384
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,806
I mean it. Just for all of it.

385
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,441
Well, it's how it should be.

386
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,370
This stuff, it's...

387
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,206
it doesn't have to be so
complicated, does it?

388
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,682
All I'm saying is don't leave the
classroom without putting shorts on

389
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,489
over those shorts.
Okay?

390
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,928
Hey, so do male strippers
work here or...

391
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,765
Ah, that's Herve,
the French spinning instructor.

392
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,764
Herve? Aren't the French
supposed to be about

393
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,842
leaving a little something
to the imagination?

394
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,850
What's with the surprise visit?

395
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,966
Oh, well, I got you a little something.
I think you might like it.

396
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,802
Oh, my God.

397
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,850
No! No, no.

398
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,968
Oh, my God, Carter.

399
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,926
No, no.

400
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,884
I'm sorry, it's a...
This is a...

401
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,610
It's just a key.

402
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,886
It's a key?
Oh, my God.

403
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,086
It's just a key.

404
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,485
I mean, you said you wanted
a key for my apartment.

405
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,289
Right, right, right.

406
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,045
- Right! You scared me.
- Sorry.

407
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,721
It's an antique chain.

408
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,485
- It's really nice.
- Do you see the beads?

409
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,521
What's that?

410
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,565
Your step-mom sent this over
with instructions to hang it.

411
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,929
- What is it?
- it's her painting.

412
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,001
She paints?

413
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,163
- Apparently, yes.
- Okay. Take it down.

414
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,242
Oh, no. I can't.

415
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,085
She threatened to sell the place
to Dunkin' Donuts if we did that.

416
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,331
Is that Sondra? What do you
think she's crying about?

417
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,890
The painting she's in.

418
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,281
- (KNOCKING ON WINDOW)
- Hi!

419
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,488
The homeless are getting
so aggressive these days.

420
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,721
What the hell?

421
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,847
- Hello.
- Hi! Whitegrass. Is that Indian?

422
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,007
No.

423
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,846
Is it the healthy drink
that you have with ginger sometimes?

424
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,809
- That's wheatgrass.
- Oh, yeah.

425
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,807
- That's so funny.
- So what are you doing here?

426
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,089
Yeah, well, listen.
I realized something

427
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,686
after you left the other day
and I had to tell you.

428
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,450
Oh, thank you. No, it's fine.
Yeah, I'm fine.

429
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,170
It turns out seeing you

430
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,246
and seeing your book,
it kind of got me going.

431
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,522
And I confronted my parents,
and set them straight

432
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,568
and showed them
who's boss.

433
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,846
Really?

434
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,324
Yeah, really.
I'm great, actually. So...

435
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,642
Definitely not that
kid from your book.

436
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,721
Well, of course you aren't.

437
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,690
You were a kid back then.
Which got me to thinking.

438
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,369
There's no current research
about people like you.

439
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,249
- People like me?
- ACODs.

440
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,561
Adult Children of Divorce.

441
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,641
That's mine.

442
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,843
I'm getting in touch with
the other subjects from my book

443
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,122
for a follow-up.
A sequel.

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,690
A 20-year study of a generation
unique to the American landscape.

445
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,003
Carter, do you realize
you were the least parented,

446
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,323
least nurtured generation ever?

447
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,801
Sorry. I'm going
to be in another book?

448
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,927
- Yes.
- No.

449
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,570
- Oh, yes.
- No, no, no, no, no.

450
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,608
- What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid of anything.

451
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,841
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)
- I can assure you of that.

452
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,207
Carter, listen to me.
When you were a little boy,

453
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,408
your parents turned to you
for emotional support.

454
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,767
They thrust you
into the center of their divorce.

455
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,446
In my book,
I called it "parentification."

456
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,525
But look at you now, as an adult.
You're well-adjusted,

457
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,080
you're successful,
you're responsible.

458
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,446
Look, you're the owner
of the Wheatgrass.

459
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,760
Whitegrass.

460
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,605
You're dressing sharp,
you have a great haircut.

461
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,081
I want to tell that story, Carter.

462
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,489
- It is a better story.
- Infinitely. It's inspiring.

463
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,961
I can set the record straight
about "Rick"?

464
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,170
Now, I'm free most days, but Friday
at 1:00 is really good for me.

465
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,850
- How about you?
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)

466
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,571
- Can you give me just a second?
- Sure.

467
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,566
Hey, Sondra, what's up?

468
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,847
SONDRA: Hey, how is
the father-son retreat going?

469
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,726
Um, what?

470
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,006
When's your tee time?

471
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,206
My...

472
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,409
Where are you?

473
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:50,086
I'm at my sorority
reunion at Cornell.

474
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,211
You went to Cornell?

475
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,089
Shocking, Carter.
Put your father on.

476
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,289
Oh, my God, JJ, you look amazing!
You're so skinny.

477
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,081
What?

Well, go get him.

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,561
I... I can't.

482
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,846
Just yell his name.

483
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,490
I'm getting my clubs cleaned.

484
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,801
Can I have him call you right back?

<i>Oh, my God, forget it.</i>

486
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,122
Just tell him I look really good, that
I look better than a lot of people here.

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,770
Okay?

488
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,726
- Who was that?
- On the phone?

489
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,964
- Yeah.
- My chef. He just needs peppers...

490
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,447
Why don't I clear
the whole day on Friday?

491
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,521
Okay.

492
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,246
I'm so happy to be working
with you again, Carter.

Have you talked to Dad?

Yeah. He's home sick.

So you talked to him?

Yeah, we were supposed to go tux
shopping for the greatest tux ever,

and said he was shitting fire.

Please excuse me for one minute.
I'm gonna be right back.

524
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,568
Okay, how about we take
50 deep breaths.

525

One hundred deep breaths. Okay?
I'll be right back.

526

- Yes!

that's what they were doing?

530
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,170

00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,887
- How?
- it was moving.

532
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,282
Look, she'd never been there before.
He had to give her directions.

533
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,691
They talked on the phone,

534
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,401
or texted or sexted.
Or some disgusting thing.

535
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,491
They planned this. it was planned.
They planned this.

We don't keep in touch.

so we don't offend anyone.

543
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,282

What's going on?

546
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,004
We're mocking up seating charts
for the reception.

547
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,162
Okay, so, originally,

548
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,481
we had thought we would
have Mom's table over here,

549
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,400
and Dad's table way over here, and then
this is three generations of Kobayashis.

550
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,091
Yellow was the only other
color we had.

551
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,525
Yeah, I just thought...

552
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,762
(LAUGHING)
What are the odds?

553
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,242
But thanks to your handiwork,
we had thought maybe

554
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,325
we could have Mom and Dad's tables,
next to each other or...

555
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,771
A family table?

556
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,569
My parents and your
parents all sit together?

557
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,801
No.

558
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,121
Well, no, it's okay.
We're gonna do a dry run first,

559
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,646
because her parents want to meet Mom
and Dad before the wedding anyway.

560
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,290
- No.
- I mean, it won't be a big deal.

561
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,125
Not a big dinner.
Just tea or something.

562
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,521
No, no, look, Mom and Dad
should go here and here,

563
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,126
and they are not to interact
in any capacity at any time.

564
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,202
Do you understand?

565
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,166
Okay, look, Lauren and
I will go to tea, okay?

566
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,287
She likes tea.

567
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,966
She likes weird tea, like rooibos and
oolong and all that bullshit, okay?

568
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,008
- It'll be awesome.

00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,920
Yeah, except I could fire
the ones I didn't like.

676
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,650
That's good.

677
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,367
You said you had a girlfriend.
Her name is Lauren? Tell me about her.

678
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,091
Lauren and I have a great thing.

679
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,447
We never fight and there's no chaos,

680
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,287
and she's really
even and fun.

681
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,601
- But?
- I didn't say "but."

682
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,524
You didn't say the word, okay?
Don't pick nits with me, all right?

683
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,400
This isn't gonna work if you're
picking at everything I say.

684
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,527
But?

685
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,367
I mean, she's not always realistic
about how families really work.

686
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,091
I mean, her parents have
been married for, like, 35 years

687
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,611
(WHISTLES)

688
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,927
and they celebrate every anniversary
with a party.

689
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,929
Have you ever been
to a 34th anniversary?

690
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,047
No.

691
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,770
It's a lot like a 33rd.

692
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,525
So, where do you see your
relationship with Lauren going?

693
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,526
My brother jumped in,
and my parents,

694
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,807
I mean, they spent their whole lives
being hasty and irrational.

695
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,121
So you're afraid of making
the same mistakes your parents made.

696
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,241
No. No.

697
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,970
I'm gonna call that
"echoing." Echoing.

698
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,530
- Don't write that down.
- I love it.

699
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,647
No, it's not echoing.

700
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,688
- I'm writing the book.
- I'm sorry?

701
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,524
Okay, so I'll decide if
echoing is in the book or not.

702
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,126
And I just coined a new term,
and I think it's clever.

703
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,645
I got what I needed.
Thank you.

704
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,927
And I'll see you next week.
This is great.

705
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,840
(SIGHS)

706
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,771
How'd it go?

707
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,326
It was... What?

708
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,291
Did she make you cry?

709
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,447
No.

710
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,125
Oh, are you...

711
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,441
You must be Claire.

712
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,803
Or Marcy.

713
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,687
Why not Yvette?

714
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,490
Well, I don't know.
I always pictured Yvette black.

715
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,881
Because her father ran off
with her basketball coach?

716
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,769
- A little racist.
- Yep.

717
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:47,650
You have got to be Rick.

718
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,728
I'm not. I'm not Rick.

719
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,961
You're totally Rick.

720
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,486
I am totally not Rick.
I'm Kevin.

721
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,891
Kevin dropped out of high school,

722
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,009
became a devout Muslim,
and moved to Pakistan.

723
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,527
Exactly. Yeah, I just got back
from my pilgrimage two weeks ago,

724
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,322
and just figuring it all out,
trying out this sweater.

725
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,930
It feels good.

726
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,168
Got to shave my beard,
so that feels good.

727
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,727
Did the cops really show up
on your ninth birthday?

728
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,404
Yeah, but it wasn't a big deal.

729
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,641
Liar.

730
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,209
I got to get in there.

731
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,684
I'm gonna start off with
a little incest anecdote.

732
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,570
Just to throw her off her game.

733
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,843
Catch you later, Rick.

734
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,685
Hey, do you think Glen
should wear a tux?

735
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,761
Who?

736
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,841
Gary's son, Glen.

737
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,365
I asked him to officiate
the wedding.

738
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,487
You what?

739
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,801
Yeah, I mean, I just figured
it's the least I could do.

740
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,803
Since Gary's been so generous.

741
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,723
Glen lives in Alaska, Trey.

742
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,644
I know, but he's a
pastor or a deacon.

743
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,131
Captain of a fishing boat.

744
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,168
Right, so he can marry people.

745
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,605
Yeah, on a boat.

746
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,001
Yeah, maritime law.
He can marry us.

747
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,809
You've never even met him.

748
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,362
Well, I know, but he's family. This will
be a good way to get to know him.

749
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,008
The more, the merrier.

750
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,366
I'm done.

751
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,488
All right. We look like
a couple of riverboat gamblers,

752
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,642
like Burt Reynolds, huh?
(CLAPS)

753
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,051
You're up, buddy.

754
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,130
- Get in there.
- Stop.

755
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,690
This whole marriage thing
is easy for you.

756
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,570
Well, you've seen Kieko.
She's smoking hot.

757
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,803
And when she gets pregnant,
she's gonna stay hot,

758
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,491
because Japanese women
carry it all in their bellies.

759
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,325
There might be a little spillover
to the boobs, but that's it.

760
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,686
You shouldn't share that theory
with anyone.

761
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,762
- She knows it.
- Just...

762
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,606
Dad was supposed to be
here a half hour ago.

763
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,444
TREY: Hey, it's Trey.
Is my dad around?

764
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,809
Really? Okay.

765
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,647
- What's wrong?
- He's been at a tux fitting all morning.

766
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,371
Try Mom.

767
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,363
Call her at the office.

768
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,331
TREY: Hey, Lorraine, it's Trey.
ls Mom there?

769
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,202
Oh, wow,
Pilates again.

770
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,282
Okay, thanks anyway. Bye.

771
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,291
Shit.

772
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,011
I mean, do you have any idea
how long a Pilates class lasts?

773
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,321
It's like an hour.
Maybe an hour and a half.

774
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,528
And my mom has been gone
for three hours.

775
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,801
Is that not weird to you?

776
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,724
Does that not raise any
red flags whatsoever?

777
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,802
Things are slow.

778
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,484
Our industry's dying.

779
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,369
Shit! No!

780
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,602
Down, down, down, down!

781
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,966
Where are the stairs?

782
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,324
What are you doing?

783
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,644
(ENGINE STARTING)

784
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,329
What are you gonna do?
Run me...

785
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,841
Hey.

786
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,605
What's this?

787
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,647
Nothing.

788
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,051
Why are you reading it?

789
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,290
I wasn't.

790
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,409
It's probably Trey's.
He's always leaving his crap around.

791
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,971
These poor kids.

792
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,523
One of them, he had
this awesome drum set,

793
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,285
but his mom wouldn't let him play it,
because it was a gift from his dad.

794
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,048
So it just sat in the garage unused,
like it was taunting him or something.

795
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,890
Probably was.

796
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:11,209
So, my brother is spearheading the
song this year for my parents' party.

797
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,970
What anniversary is this?

798
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,565
37.

799
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,888
You should probably get up.

800
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,285
You going somewhere?

801
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,650
Tea with the Kobayashis.

802
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,484
Oh, shit, that's tonight.

803
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,643
(STAMMERING)
I'm not going.

804
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,883
You dragged me into it.
I don't even like tea.

805
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,081

808
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,922
Carter, it's a thrill
to finally meet you.

809
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,321
Helping the kids with the wedding
the way you have,

810
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,845
it's really above and beyond.

811
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,161
Oh, well, what option
did I have, really?

812
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,641
I love these two.
But who are we kidding?

813
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,324
They're just a couple
bad decisions away

814
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,210
from sleeping beneath an underpass,
am I right?

815
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,011
Mrs. Kobayashi,
that necklace is incredible.

816
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,167
Oh, I made it for her.

817
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,207
Yes.

818
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,441
She also made this for me.

819
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,521
Kieko.

820
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,571
TREY: I know, right?

821
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,801
Room for one more in here?

822
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,401

823
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,240
TREY: Oh, my gosh, you made it!

824
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,367
HUGH: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

825
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,363
Dad, this is Mr.
and Mrs. Kobayashi.

826
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,851
Oh, hi, hi.

827
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,046
Nice to meet you, too.

828
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,248
You must be Ellen.

829
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,883
Come, sit. Please.

830
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,849
Hey, sweetheart.
Hi, you look beautiful.

831
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,811
- Hi, guys.
- You made it.

832
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,961
Hi.

833
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,081
Oh!

834
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,007
Classy joint.

835
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,086
More tea!

836
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,009
- Sorry I'm late.
- Mom?

838

What are you doing here?

839
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,722
I should ask you,
what are you doing here?

840
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:49,122
Trey called me and told me about
this very important meeting.

841
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,202
He called me as well.

842
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,044
I never thought you
would both show up.

843

As long as we're here...

844
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,805
HUGH: Completely by coincidence.

845
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,564
We may as well act maturely.

846
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,564
I don't totally agree with you,
but you know what I'm going to do?

847
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,081
I'm going to try to agree with
you more as time goes on,

848
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,527
so that we can be more civil.

Move it.

850
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,529
What the hell?

851
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,371
MELISSA:
Oh, come on.

852
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,204
Food looks good here,
doesn't it?

853
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,770
<i>Watashi wa</i> Melissa.

854
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,649
Hello, I'm Gene.
Nice to meet you.

855
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,200
Nice English.
Your turn.

856
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,089
<i>Watashi wa</i> Melissa.

857
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,730
Yes, my name is Ellen.

858
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,524
What else can you say?

859
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,926
(LAUGHING)

860
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,121
Two, two and a half?

861
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,201
Three.

862
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,441
Three, right. All right, three.

863
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,800
So Trey was crying
like a little girl.

864
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,888
(LAUGHING)

865
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,325
Trey was such a sensitive little
boy, terrified of everything.

866
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,961
Oh, my Lord, spiders,
shoelaces, the mailman.

867
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,280
Remember? Oh.

868
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,324
I just picked him up, and I just
threw him in the fucking lake.

869
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,890
Without the water wings.

870
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,089
Because it's sink or swim time,
right, Trey, buddy?

871
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,123
(IMITATES CHOKING)

872
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,402
We saved at least $400
in swimming lessons.

873
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,481
Ba-dump-bum.

874
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,927
(LAUGHING)

875
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,166
I don't even remember this.

876
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,124
Yeah, because it was me.

877
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,090
The water wings, that was me.
I was five. I almost drowned.

878
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,207
It was hilarious.

879
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,361
Super funny.

880
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,321
What? By the time
Trey was old enough to swim,

881
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,726
you guys weren't even
married anymore.

882
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,723
You were way divorced.

883
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,366
I guess just as divorced
as you are right now.

884
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,320
- Well, let's eat.
- KIEKO: Good idea.

885
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,606
TREY: Who wants sticky buns?
KIEKO: I do.

886
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,001
You know what, actually,
I need to get some air.

887
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,361
- (CLATTERS)
- Oh, God.

888
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,441
(EXCLAIMING)

889
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,370
I'm sorry.

890
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,441
TREY:
Not cool, man.

891
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,965
MRS. KOBAYASHI: That's all right.
It's okay. No, I...

892
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,327
So you had to shit all over
the water wings story.

893
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,765
You said it was a one-time thing.

894
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,330
It was.

895
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,686
- Really?
- Yeah.

896
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,570
So you're actually gonna stand here
and look me in the eye and...

897
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,881
- Wow, you're really good at lying.
- What?

898
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,803
Hugh, forget it.
He knows.

899
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,211
He's been spying on us.

900
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,481
At the zoo?

901
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,686
The zoo?

902
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,810
So, wait a second, you guys are
actually having a full-on affair?

903
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,164
I don't know what to call it.

904
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,607
Well, what did you call it
when you busted him

905
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,489
with a six-foot Swede named Elka?

906
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,561
How is that relevant?

907
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,041
"How is that relevant?"
Have you forgotten the last 20 years?

908
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,281
You hate each other.

909
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,569
Carter, I know you think you know better.
That's a trait you get from your father.

910
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,801
I do know better.

911
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,690
But the heart wants
what the heart wants.

912
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,161
Come on.

913
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,846
We are very confused, so we're
going to Wildwood this weekend,

914
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,081
and we're gonna
figure it all out.

915
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,242
There's a bluegrass festival,
and we're going to...

916
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,448
No, Crystal Lake,
and it's jazz.

917
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,521
What happened to Wildwood?

918
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,409
I couldn't get the rate
on the room, so...

919
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,323
- And when were you gonna tell me?
- I'm telling you now.

920
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:02,686
- No, you weren't gonna tell me.
- Yeah, I was...

921
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,649
You were not.
I have to drag it out of you.

922
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,721
Hey!

923
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,450
It's like pulling teeth!

924
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:10,729
You're not going anywhere,
either of you. You are staying here.

925
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,724
Do you hear me?
You stop it, now, both of you.

926
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,531
Invitations just went out
for Trey's wedding,

927
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,002
based on the assumption that you are
both married to other people.

928
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:24,565
How in the world is he supposed
to have any faith whatsoever

929
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,961
in the whole stupid
idea of marriage,

930
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,361
if you two just keep
making a joke out of it?

931
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,646
Stop it right there.

932
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,961
You've never been married,
and you've never been divorced,

933
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,281
so you do not know
what commitment is.

934
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,361
You don't know.

935
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,051
The most in love I've ever seen you
is with that mangy little dog you had.

936
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,690
- Don't, don't...
- You keep Blackie out of this.

937
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,330
No, I was right there,
Carter.

938
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,004
- All right, all right.
- You weren't there.

939
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,731
Are you gonna let him talk
to me this way?

940
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,131
- (BOTH ARGUING)
- Shh. Quiet. Be quiet.

941
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,925
We're in a Japanese restaurant.
Stop it, please.

942
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:57,006
Now you get your ass back inside
and you apologize to the Takahashis.

943
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,686
I'm...

944
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,240
Come on. Come on.

945
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,444
It's Kobayashis.

946
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,050
You can just never
stop parenting.

947
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,326
I know.

948
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,767
Yeah, can't let it go.

949
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,080
You were great.

950
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,925
- Do we have to go back?
- No, no, come on.

951
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,331
Okay, good.

952
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,166
Carter.

953
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,089
What a nice surprise.

954
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,325
What's up, "C"?

955
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,564
Gary, where does Mom keep all that
stuff that she never throws out,

956
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:42,406
the pictures and the letters and
all the lawsuits and legal stuff?

957
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,086
In the garage.
Hope you have a few days.

958
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,525
Awesome.

959
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,841
What the...

960
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:22,685
Hey, I don't know if you heard the
news, but Trey is getting married.

961
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,843
And, well, Elka,

962
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,164
I had this really cool, really fun idea
that I thought you would love.

963
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:36,084
I'm gonna call you back.

964
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:38,720
Elka?

965
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,041
- Yes.
- I didn't know you still talked.

966
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,851
We don't.
I just had this idea that

967
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,481
maybe if my dad were to bump
into Elka even for a second,

968
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,404
he would get that look in his eye,
the panther,

969
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,164
and my mom would be
an afterthought.

970
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,365
Wow, panther.

971
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,927
Um, I really think you need
to take a step back.

972
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,041
What do you mean?

973
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,805
They're adults.
Let them handle it.

974
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,281
Oh, no, no, no, see?
I'm the adult. Okay?

975
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,170
And, once again, I need to
remind them that they do not,

976
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,322
under any circumstances,
belong together.

977
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,564
Them together is
bad for everyone.

978
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,045
Especially me.

979
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:20,731
Makes sense. I mean, how could
Rick turn out any other way?

980
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,127
What?

981
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,807
It was in the book,
the one that you lied about.

982
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,451
Dr. Judith came by.
She had some questions for me.

983
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,727
She had a lot of questions.

984
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,290
You gotta be kidding me.

985
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,524
How come you can't tell me
about this, about any of it?

986
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,167
Because I just...

987
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,203
I can't believe she would
go behind my back.

988
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,170
I mean, do you know that
she's not an actual doctor?

989
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,765
- That she just does research?
- Right.

990
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,961
Like, as a job?

991
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,284
She just digs and digs
and digs and...

992
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,722
I know it's a weird way
to wear a hat,

993
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,928
but it just feels comfortable.

994
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,843
She told me she wants me
to wear a wedding ring,

995
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,083
but I said the only ring
I wear goes in my eyebrow.

996
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,640
What does this have
to do with anything?

997
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,171
(DOOR OPENS)

998
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,443
Carter. I don't have
you on my schedule.

999
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,649
Yeah, well, I figured, once you started
snooping around behind my back,

1000
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,370
all formalities were off.

1001
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,090
I can see you're very upset.

1002
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,605
What, are you a therapist now?

1003
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,251
Oh, and by the way,
don't let the new couch fool you

1004
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,845
or the new chair. What is it?

1005
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,285
It's a knockoff of
an Eames chair.

1006
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,522
That's not the point.
That's not why I was saying that.

1007
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,729
Oh, my God.
You're Rick.

1008
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,609
Mark a.k.a. Louis.

1009
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,602
Louis with the au pair
and the stutter.

1010
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,162
Stutter's gone.
I did marry the au pair.

1011
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:57,490
Can I just say, the birthday story,
such a heartbreaker.

1012
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,762
I mean, a seminal moment in my life,
and it's not even my life.

1013
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,080
Okay, Mark.

1014
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,491
Oh, all right.

1015
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,609
Could you just give
us a moment, okay?

1016
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,160
You, outside. Stay.

1017
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,241
Copy that.

1018
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,208
Is this about Lauren?

1019
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,041
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay. Well, sorry.

1020
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,770
I was just trying to
get a full picture.

1021
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,683
- No, it's fine.
- Really?

1022
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,364
Thing is you're barking
up the wrong tree.

1023
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,125
If I were you,
I would go to the source.

1024
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,001
I would talk to my parents.

1025
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,445
- Really?
- Yes.

1026
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,363
Pound them with questions,
really dig.

1027
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,321
See this box?

1028
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,050
This will help you.

1029
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,487
It's pictures, letters,
legal documents.

1030
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,801
You should show it to them
and ask them all about it.

1031
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,962
Okay, thank you,
and I will do that.

1032
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:46,320
Okay?

1033
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,767
Before the weekend.

1034
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,126
Got it.

1035
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,967
Hey, Lauren's really nice.

1036
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,441
You've been keeping a lot of
secrets from her, though, huh?

1037
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,443
Who does that remind you of?

1038
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,966
You are incredibly unprofessional.

1039
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,685
Get on it.

1040
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:22,681
- Trivia night.
- Trivia night?

1041
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,807
- Trivia night.
- What's that?

1042
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,291
Hey.

1043
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,171
Hey.
Hey.

1044
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,005
Do you work here?

1045
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,605
Kind of. It's my place.

1046
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,403
I'm sorry. I'm Carter.

1047
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,526
- Charles.
- Charles.

1048
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,080
So how do you two know each other?

1049
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,962
Well, we're part of a...

1050
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,007
- Book club.
- Book club.

1051
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,845
We're in a book club together.

1052
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:54,051
That's right. We're just finishing
<i>The Importance of Being Earnest.</i>

1053
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,121
That's a play.

1054
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,244
It's a progressive book club.

1055
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,811
(LAUGHING)

1056
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,966
All right, well, check's paid.
You want to go?

1057
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,964
Um,

1058
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,647
actually, you know what?
I think I'm gonna stay here

1059
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,644
and chat with Carter because

1060
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:18,283
there's a few things about
the play that I didn't quite get.

1061
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,601
Hmm.

1062
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,569
That's a farce.

1063
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,564
They farced the moral disintegration
of Victorian England.

1064
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,484
I didn't actually read it.

1065
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,364
I'll call you later.

1066
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,805
All right.

1067
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,609
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.

1068
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,444
- Thanks.
- Oh, you're welcome.

1069
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,681
Sorry.

1070
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,290
That was my ex-husband.

1071
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,769
That was your ex-husband.
Ol' Man River?

1072
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,162
I actually think
he's quite sexy.

1073
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,164
(STAMMERING)
I do, too. I was just...

1074
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:58,529
So if you own the place,
then the wine's free?

1075
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,841
Yeah.

1076
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,447
CARTER: That lake house
was everything when I was a kid.

1077
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,047
The drive up there,
the smell of the lake.

1078
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:14,803
We had this bell,
this rusty, super loud bell.

1079
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,291
It was from a ship
or something.

1080
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:19,648
We could only ring it
when we first arrived.

1081
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:21,241
Um...

1082
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,527
It was just kind of awesome.
I don't know.

1083
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,489
Never been back.
Not since my ninth birthday.

1084
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:40,403
My parents sort of sucked
the joy right out of it, you know?

1085
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,721
- Fuck them.
- Yeah.

1086
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,807
How old were you
when you got married?

1087
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,211
Nineteen.

1088
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,808
It only lasted three years.

1089
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,486
But I got engaged twice after that.

1090
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:01,721
Wait a second. I just figured out
who you are in the book.

1091
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,807
You're Claire.

1092
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,241
Had her first boyfriend
when she was nine.

1093
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,688
You are Claire. Right?

1094
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:15,721
I have two dogs that need to
go out, so I'm gonna go.

1095
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,040
Okay. Yeah. Sure.

1096
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,690
All right.

1097
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,000
Thanks. This was...

1098
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,768
Oh, no, thank you.
it was nice talking to you.

1099
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,968
- Yeah. You, too.
- All right.

1100
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:30,081
- Cool.
- Yep.

1101
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,806
- Ow!
- Careful, careful.

1102
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,569
(DISHES CLATTERING)

1103
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,721
Hey, Etta.

1104
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,442
I forgot my purse.

1105
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,846
Maybe this isn't such
a good idea.

1106
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,047
Those look so good.

1107
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,565
Oh, no, no, don't.

1108
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,880
Don't you dare.

1109
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,246
All right.
I'll have it.

1110
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,008
Oh. Okay. Okay.

1111
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:26,962
Three, one, four, and two.

1112
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,169
I totally agree.
I'm so excited!

1113
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,323
Hey, what do you think?

1114
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,207
What?

1115
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,089
About the cake.
What's your pick?

1116
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,369
Oh, God, it's such
a tough choice. Um...

1117
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:48,688
They all taste the same,
and no one will like them.

1118
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,088
I don't get you, man.

1119
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,968
Look, if you're against this wedding,
you just need to come out and say that.

1120
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,087
I'm not.

1121
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,844
Well, then what is it?

1122
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,569
Things are just kind of out
of control right now, okay?

1123
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,646
I don't know
what that means.

1124
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,802
Well, it means
that you don't want to know, okay?

1125
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,291
So don't worry about it.

1126
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,488
You can tell me.
I'm a grown man, Carter.

1127
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,126
- Mom and Dad are together.
- What?

1128
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,202
That's right. I may have accidentally
gotten them back together.

1129
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,281
So there you go.

1130
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,362
- Together, together?
- Yeah.

1131
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:28,562
- Shit.
- Yeah.

1132
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,164
What do we do about this?
What should we do?

1133
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,605
I don't know.
I'm out of ideas.

1134
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,808
So why don't you
take the reins, okay?

1135
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,489
I got my own problems.

1136
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,570
(SIREN CHIRPING)

1137
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,324
They're saying multiple code violations
and not having a proper lease filed.

1138
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,925
(WHISPERS) What the fuck?

1139
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,881
Jesus.

1140
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,164
You're out. One week.

1141
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,207
What?

1142
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,408
Your mother?
That's just sad.

1143
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:08,324
Okay, Sondra,

1144
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,404
I know that you're upset,
and I actually don't blame you,

1145
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,801
but I don't think we should
do anything rash here.

1146
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:17,123
(STAMMERING) I mean,
both of you, you're just...

1147
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,929
You're so terrific together.

1148
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,809
Are you fucking serious, Carter?

1149
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:23,167
You've hated me from day one.
You call me the Cuntessa.

1150
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:27,165
I don't think I called you that.
That's terrible. I hate that.

1151
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,686
Excuse me, will you be careful
with that? It's very valuable.

1152
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,364
Sondra, let me buy
you out, please.

1153
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,489
Okay? I can get money.
I can get a loan of some sort,

1154
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,131
and I can't kick all
these people to the street.

1155
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,208
- Okay.
- Okay? Really?

1156
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,327
Yes.

1157
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,489
- Great.
- $100 million.

1158
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,841
Fine. $50.

1159
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,007
Okay, um...

1160
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:50,048
Do you know how many men
I could have married?

1161
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,282
A lot of men.

1162
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,361
And I married your father,

1163
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,886
who had an adult son
the same age as me.

1164
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,121
I'm a year younger than you.

1165
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,326
- You think?
- Yeah.

1166
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,401
Congratulations.

1167
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,481
It's irrelevant.

1168
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,842
You didn't spend five minutes
getting to know who I was.

1169
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,651
You just treated me
like some unwelcomed guest.

1170
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,967
Wow.

1171
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,649
Maybe in another time
we would have been friends.

1172
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,006
No.

1173
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,369
You have a week
to get out of here.

1174
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,044
You know what, Sondra?

1175
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,321
You...

1176
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:41,085
I'm dying here, man.
You got to move those accounts now.

1177
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,528
I don't know.
The Caymans? Delaware?

1178
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,126
Yeah, Delaware, I saw a thing
on the Internet about it.

1179
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,851
I'll call you back.
Numbnuts is here.

1180
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,327
You dumb son of a bitch.

1181
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,006
You dumb, dumb,
dumb son of a bitch.

1182
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,209
I mean, there's a reason we used you
as a go-between all these years.

1183
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,125
Your brother sucks at it.

1184
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,009
- He told her?
- No, he e-mailed me to see

1185
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:09,523
if what you said was true to an
account that I share with Sondra.

1186
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,001
Okay, well, I wouldn't
have done that.

1187
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,160
You don't end a marriage
like this, son.

1188
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,481

Trey, let me tell you something.

1209
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,727
The reason you're so clear-headed
about getting married

1210
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:12,567
is because I shielded you
from these two your whole life,

1211
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,449
which, by the way,
almost didn't happen.

1212
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:18,525

effort to save this marriage.

any worse.

01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,000
Have fun.

1365
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:01,524
HUGH: I don't see him.

1366
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,568
Maybe he's in the water.

1367
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,691
Carter, what are you doing here?

1368
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,687
What are you doing here?

1369
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,410
TREY: Honey, it's all over the car.

1370
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:16,561
You don't smell it?

1371
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,927
I do, but I like it.

1372
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:21,930
It's all over the front of my pants.
It fell down.

1373
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:24,646
Who invited him?

1374
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:26,131
I don't know.
He's just here.

1375
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,725
Trey, get those ribs
in the fridge, please.

1376
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:28,921
TREY: Okay.

1377
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,128
Okay, what is going on?

1378
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:34,249
We're here for the night,
just kind of a family getaway.

1379
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,367
Oh.

1380
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,407
No offense.

1381
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:37,891
None taken.

1382
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,485
You quit us, remember?

1383
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:40,931
Darling, you need
some help with those?

1384
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,480
No, no, I got 'em. I got 'em.

1385
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,608
Sweetie, put some of these
on a plate with some bread,

1386
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:46,920
and we'll get some
hors d'oeuvres going.

1387
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,843
Bread and a plate.
Let's get this party started.

1388

1390
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:54,201

1391
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:55,441
They've been coming for years.

1392
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,171
- They what?
- No, no.

1393
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,368
Maybe once or twice.

1394
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,441
A month.

1395
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,966
On the ride up here, you said
you barely remember the place.

1396
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,361
Yeah, I barely remember
the place with you.

1397
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:07,965
You Google-mapped directions.

1398
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:09,371
I should probably go.

1399
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:12,005
SONDRA: I knew it.

1400
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,404
The security company called
and said the alarm had been tripped.

1401
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:17,281
Is she speaking to us?

1402
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,801
No.

1403
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,450
I'm sorry. There's an alarm?

1404
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,289
Yes, we added it a
couple months ago.

1405
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,964
HUGH:
It was her idea.

1406
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,963
What other improvements
has she made to my house?

1407
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:28,850
Well, Melissa, if you
actually need to know,

1408
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:33,164
we added a new septic system,
and I crocheted a few blankets.

1409
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,327
You crochet?

1410
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,448
Yes, asshole, I crochet.

1411
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,531
I also finished
all the puzzles in the house.

1412
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,604
Wait a second. Am I the only one
that hasn't been coming here?

1413
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:46,411
- We camped.
- But we never came in the house.

1414
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,720
Yeah, he made me pee
under the porch.

1415
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:48,926
You're welcome.

1416

SONDRA: Believe it or not,

1417
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:52,370
Hugh and I had
some happy memories here.

1418
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:53,930
And I had big plans for this place.

1419
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,081
Mmm-hmm.

1420
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:58,363
A third bedroom upstairs,
an outdoor shower...

1421
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,605
HUGH: Oh, boy.

1422
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,246
You'll never get this house.

1423
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,765
You haven't met my lawyer.

1424
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,525
Well, Hugh and I are very good at
tying it up in court, aren't we, Hugh?

1425
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,726
Oh, well, yeah.

1426
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,962
May I attempt to be a
voice of reason?

1427
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,690
Shut up, Gary.

1428
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,330
Don't tell Gary to shut up, please.

- Dick.
- MELISSA: Gary!

1430
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:19,407
He is a dick. I had Carter out
of his restaurant in 12 hours.

1431
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:20,891
I'll have all of you
out of here in six.

1438
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,442
Daddy, it's happening again.

1439
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,725

Just send me a plane ticket.

1440

Make sure it's an aisle seat.

1441
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,563
Look, I'm so sorry we
didn't invite you.

1442
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,801
- Oh, dude...
- I wanted to.

1443
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,848
Mom and Dad
would not let me invite you.

1444
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:00,968
- That's...
- He took my phone.

1445
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,242
- They're like fucking children.
- Yeah.

1446
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,322
I don't know how you've put up
with them all these years.

1447

Trey, I am sorry I messed up
your wedding.

1448
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,009
No. You didn't.

1449

No, no one did.

1450
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:18,166
It was just bad timing.

01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,570
Kieko thought that
you didn't like her,

1452
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,570
but then I showed her
that book that you're in,

1453
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,045
and now she does not care
what you think.

And it is right outside.

1469
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:02,164
Why did you say "water"?

1470
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,810
- Are you serious?
- Fill it up.

01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,009
"Maybe this is exactly
where I'm supposed to be."

1535
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:11,806
Wow.

1536
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:21,689
And I've had that feeling
at least 10 times in my life.

1537
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,961
- (SIGHS)
- Hey, you boys ready?

1538
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,326
Scared me.

1539
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,731
This is really happening.

1540
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,802
You better believe it.

1541
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,166
All right.

1542
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,884
Let's do this thing.

1543
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:19,640
I am an ACOD.

1544
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:23,167
Yes, I am an adult child of divorce.

1545
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,924
I am an ACOD.

1546
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:29,642
I am an ACOD. My parents
divorced when I was 10 years old.

1547
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:32,803
My parents were divorced when I
was five, they were not in love.

1548
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:37,124
Technically, I'm not an
adult child of divorce.

1549
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:40,961
I was an adult
when my parents got divorced.

1550
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,761
I am an ACOD.

1551
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:49,846
I am an ACOD. I feel like
everyone probably is, on the set.

1552
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:52,088
I'm not an ACOD.

1553
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:55,721
I am not an ACOD. My parents
have been married for 31 years.

1554
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,765
I am not an ACOD. My parents
are still happily married.

1555
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,410
They met when they
were in eighth grade.

1556
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:06,771
I am not an ACOD. My parents
were married for 31 years,

1557
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,410
happily married the
whole time,

1558
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:11,171
but my dad was married
four times before my mom.

1559
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:14,483
Yeah, I'm an adult child
of divorce, yes.

1560
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,404
Uh, my parents got divorced
when I was 18 years old.

1561
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:20,609
Uh, my parents separated
when I was 12 months old.

1562
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:23,570
And, uh, got divorced
when I was five.

1563
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:25,563
I don't ever remember
my parents being together.

1564
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:27,529
They were divorced
by the time I was five.

1565
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,602
Four, five, six,
something like that.

1566
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:34,607
I have a half-brother
who's 13 years older than I am.

1567
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:37,524
And I have a step-mom
and a step-dad.

1568
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:41,525
My mom got remarried,
and divorced again,

1569
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,241
and my dad is still a bachelor.
It's really awesome.

1570
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:49,484
My parents got divorced
when I was, gosh, five or six.

1571
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:52,564
Uh, I've never known what it's
like for them to be together.

1572
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:55,405
And, uh, it's pretty much
exactly like this movie,

1573
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:58,006
they've never been able to talk
and I've always been the middleman.

1574
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:01,004
Parents divorced
when I was 11.

1575
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:05,051
Uh, remarried when I
was 17 and 18.

1576
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:06,161
You know?

1577
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:07,651
They've been divorced
for 15 years,

1578
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:10,041
and they act like they never
even knew each other.

1579
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:13,283
They act like they can't be
in the same room with one another.

1580
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,600
I don't get it.

1581
01:25:14,680 --> 01:25:19,891
It was horrible, the divorce, and
I ended up living with my mother,

1582
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:22,167
and being the one
that was in charge of everyone.

1583
01:25:22,240 --> 01:25:25,847
I wanted to live with my dad,
but I fought and fought and fought,

1584
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,810
and I couldn't do it,
so I just stayed here with my mom,

1585
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:32,089
and I still haven't seen
my dad in 25 years.

1586
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:35,767
My mom remarried
when I was about four or five,

1587
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:38,844
and my dad remarried
about the same time.

1588
01:25:38,920 --> 01:25:41,924
And they hated each other
the whole time.

1589
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,721
That was my mother's second husband,
my father's first wife.

1590
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,804
My mother was then remarried
again for 13 years.

1591
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,805
Uh, lam still the only child
as far as that's concerned.

1592
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,406
My father got remarried 20 years
ago and I have a step-sister,

1593
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,482
who I don't really
have a relationship with.

1594
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:59,688
My parents never got remarried.
My dad was gay.

1595
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:03,247
Well, my father asked
my mother for a divorce.

1596
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:06,284
But she died before
she could get one.

1597
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:09,330
My dad is on,
well, technically, number five.

1598
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:13,210
And, uh, mom never remarried.

1599
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,523
And, uh, I'm hoping to
break the curse.

1600
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:18,489
My parents were divorced
when I was 10 years old,

1601
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:22,531
but I still believe in marriage, and,
one day, I will find the right one.

1602
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,011
I don't ever want to get married.

1603
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,287
I'm an ACOD,
I'm never getting married, either.

1604
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:27,964
Now, I don't think I would
want to get married,

1605
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:30,281
just because in my experience,
the marriage didn't work out.

1606
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,165
I'm not getting married.

1607
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,890
- CAMERAMAN: Ever?
- Never.

1608
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,480
I have been married twice
and divorced twice.

1609
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:37,686
I have been married.

1610
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,125
- CAMERAMAN: How many times?
- Twice.

1611
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:42,044
I don't like marriage,
never did, never will.

1612
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:44,521
I've been going with a guy
for 40 years, but I told him,

1613
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,329
"Don't ever mention marriage."

1614
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:48,408
I think marriage is sacred.

1615
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,404
I think it's something
not to be taken lightly,

1616
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:54,051
and I think it can be
something amazing.

1617
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:57,920
I feel good about marriage myself,
because I'm getting married in two days.

1618
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,287
I am not married.
I have better sense than that, sir.

1619
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,643
Marriage?
I am married, but, uh...

1620
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:08,171
I don't know.
I'm not too romantic about it.

1621
01:27:08,240 --> 01:27:09,844
I want to get married,
but I am divorced.

1622
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,331
(LAUGHS)

1623
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:15,127
I don't want to get married someday.
No, not really.

1624
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,406
CAMERAMAN:
No? Why?

1625
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,609
Why? Because I've never
seen one that's worked.

1626
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:21,682
Never seen any
marriages that work.
