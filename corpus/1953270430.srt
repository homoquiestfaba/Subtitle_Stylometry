That's all you get?
I got the whole smackaroo!

698
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,240
So, about the dogs?

699
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,480
The dogs?
Edgar hates dogs.

700
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,080
No. No. No!
No? No?

701
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,600
I love dogs.

702
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,680
Yes, yes, yes.
Yes, yes, yes. He loves dogs.

703

705
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,200
Okay, so last time
we did the show

706
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,960
we had all the dogs
come running on the stage

707
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,600
and it got
a little chaotic.

708
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,960
So it's really,
really important

709
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,280
that we get
the dogs to trust you

710
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,520
so they feel comfortable with
you, you know, like bonding time.

711
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,360
Here, this is Belle.

712
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,880
Why couldn't it be

Come on down, guys, get
acquainted with everybody.

714
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,800
Hey, so is Walker coming?

715
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,800
We tried to get him to come,
but I don't know.

716
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,200
No, that was our deal
with the coach, though.

717
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,400
Walker ain't afraid
of no coach.

718

Yeah, not with
his old man's influence.

I didn't come here for that.

727

things up between you and me.

a confident humility.

736
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,480

Mr. Burchess?

1372
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:15,360
Thank you so much.

1373
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,440
You've given us
the best Christmas present.

1374
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:19,000
MIKE: We didn't
finish counting,

1375
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,400
but there's
more than enough.

1376
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:25,040
Just enough to
pay for my theater.

1377
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:29,920
Unfortunately not enough to pay for
the lawyer to keep you out of jail.

1378
01:34:30,360 --> 01:34:34,560
It's all right though,
certainly no hard feelings.

1379
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:37,920
Mr. Burchess here
is a man of his word,

1380
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,360
and it seems that

1381
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:44,560
the Stevens' family orphanage
for dogs and wayward children

1382
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:48,800
gonna be under new ownership, doesn't it?
Isn't that right?

1383
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:54,440
Make sure that thing doesn't
turn my theater into a toilet.

1384
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:00,800
The property,
this property is mine.

1385
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:13,200
That's actually not true.

1386
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,400
Course it's true, sugar.

1387
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:18,440
It was never signed.

1388
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:20,960
What are you talking about?

1389
01:35:21,040 --> 01:35:24,200
Never signed, he signed
that right in front of me.

1390
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:28,560
Not by Thomas Burchess.

1391
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:33,160
A slip of the pen, I'm afraid, Finneas.
A slip of the pen.

1392
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:35,800
(FINNEAS READING)

1393
01:35:38,040 --> 01:35:41,200
You signed that
"Totally Bogus!"

1394
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:43,320
How could you?

1395
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,240
After everything I've done.

1396
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:49,200
(ALL TALKING EXCITEDLY)

1397
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,560
Alli, oh, my gosh,
you were so good!

1398
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:56,800
Oh, my gosh,
you were so amazing.

1399
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:58,080
Oh, my gosh, that ending.

1400
01:35:58,200 --> 01:36:00,280
Look at the little one
you got!

1401
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:01,960
You did so great.
Thank you!

1402
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,280
There are some people in
Hollywood I want you to meet.

1403
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:11,840
Really? Thank you so much. Thank you so much.
I don't even...

1404
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:13,520
(EXCLAIMS SOFTLY)

1405
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,120
Did you hear that?

1406
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:19,720
See ya.

1407
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:20,880
WALKER: Hey, Mike.

1408
01:36:22,520 --> 01:36:24,000
So when you gonna
get out of that thing, man?

1409
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,920
We need you back
Sooner than you think.

1410
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:41,280
Saying thank you for everything
you've done is a little weak.

1411
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,960
You don't have
to say anything.

1412
01:36:44,040 --> 01:36:46,240
I am just so thankful
that you're okay.

1413
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:53,920
(CLEARS THROAT)

1414
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:58,480
So, I guess this means
we aren't going steady?

1415
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:04,400
Merry Christmas, Mike.

1416
01:37:04,520 --> 01:37:07,640
This is something from your mom
that was close to her heart.

1417
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:13,440
What?

1418
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
