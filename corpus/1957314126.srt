And I think they're mad
because we screwed up the planet.

00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,525
[Toby] Hey, Your Majesty!

354
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,484
Your Majesty.

355
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,653
- Your Majest...
- My Majesty!

356
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,197
No, Steve, don't...

357
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:03,160
Oh, my blond oaf,
you shouldn't have done that.

358
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,995
Why not? I... [squeaks]

359
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,080
[funk music playing]

360
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,630
Oh, you, uh... [mumbles] huh?

361
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,965
[scoffs] Uh-huh!

362
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,887
You got a new boyfriend?!
I knew I wasn't good enough for you.

363
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:25,599
[laughs] Eli is not my boyfriend.

364
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,559
[snaps fingers]

365
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:28,852
[Steve] Pepperjack?! What?

366
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:32,272
[whispers] What?

367
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,900
- What? Pepperjack? Pepperjack?
- [Krel] Sister!

368
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,194
I hit my growth spurt.
Who would've thought?

369
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,322
Puberty's a lot more pleasant
on an alien planet.

370
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,658
Creepslayerz?

371
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,742
Aja...

372
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,954
Why didn't you wanna kiss the Palchuk?
Makes no sense.

373
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,705
[gasps] Are you breaking up with me?

374
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,831
No, no.

375
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:54,920
If my math is right,
that was our seventh kiss.

376
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,171
Oh, no.

377
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,756
Why's that a big deal?

378
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,259
On Akiridion-5,

379
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:04,888
the seventh kiss makes baby.

380
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,557
[bird screams in distance]

381
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:10,560
You mean you're pregnant? Like, right now?

382
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,562
No, of course not.

383
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,648
Oh, good. Phew.

384
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,900
- You are.
- [dramatic music plays]

385
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,152
- [whispers] Wha...?
- [squeaks, then gulps]

386
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,320
Mazel tov.

387
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,905
- I'm gonna be a father?
- [barks]

388
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,241
Oh, wait. I'm gonna be a mother?

389
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:28,203
- Oh, man, I'm so glad I'm here for this.
- [Steve screaming]

390
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,539
[Blinky] Now that we are all here,

391
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,791
Merlin's grimoire has enlightened me

392
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,711
to the destructive forces
of the Arcane Order.

393
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:38,964
Oh, boy.
Whenever he opens a book, it's pretty bad.

394
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,049
[Jim grunting]

395
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,553
Room for one more at that big table?

396
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,013
- Jimbo!
- Jim!

397
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,389
[laughter]

398
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,433
Ah! Master Jim!

399
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:52,519
By Gorgus, it is good
to see you on your feet.

400
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:56,690
[grunts] Barely, but I am happy
to stand by your side, Blinky.

401
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,941
[chuckles]

402
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,611
So, what are we dealing with?

403
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,447
The Arcane Order.

404
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,073
[ominous music playing]

405
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,576
They seek to reawaken the Titans.

406
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:10,162
Imbued by
the Arcane's primordial energies,

407
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:14,499
three Titans were their handmaidens
to the birth of the universe.

408
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:19,379
They have been in stasis for a millennia,
awaiting a reckoning of epic proportions.

409
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:23,175
A reckoning this world,
or any other, has never seen.

410
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,428
When they combine
in the center of the universe,

411
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:30,432
Earth will be reborn,
back to the age of first creation.

412
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:33,894
"Reborn"?

413
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,480
Don't tell me
they're going to destroy the Earth.

414
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:41,443
The opposite. They will erase all life,
burn the oceans, flood the cities.

415
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,696
That's destroying it.

416
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,657
No, it's a new start.
Life will begin again.

417
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,285
Life will start anew.

418
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,453
That's a joyous spin.

419
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,580
Where is the center of the universe?

420
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,874
You are very familiar with it.

421
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:01,797
We don't technically have a school.
That doesn't mean we can't learn.

422
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,341
We're going on a field trip, zoomers.

423
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:05,592
[students groan]

424
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:09,679
Wait, Arcadia, our hometown,
is the center of the world?

425
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:13,600
- Of the universe.
- Explains a lot, when you think about it.

426
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,603
Nothing is getting reborn
as long as we have Nari.

427
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,147
They need her
to complete the ritual, correct?

428
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:22,025
All three primordial wizards
must be present, correct.

429
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,195
Tell me you know
where the Arcane Order is.

430
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:29,491
[eerie music playing]

431
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:39,459
[voices whispering indistinctly]

432
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,053
Ah-ah-ah.

433
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:53,890
- [laughs]
- [Bellroc] Struggle all you want.

434
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,727
The breaking of seals
requires only your presence,

435
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,938
not your commitment.

436
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,733
[ominous music playing]

437
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,781
[both] <i>Three will rise</i>

438
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,867
<i>Three will form</i>

439
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,119
<i>Unite and be one</i>

440
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:17,247
<i>The worlds are reborn</i>

441
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,629
Huh? Why isn't it working?

442
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,214
[laughs as Douxie]

443
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,926
[growls] She is not Nari.

444
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,428
[Skrael] Who is it?

445
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,306
[as Douxie] Abracadabra, butt-snacks.

446
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,266
Prattle on.

447
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,477
This world was created
to become a paradise

448
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:43,148
in which every creature
would live in harmony.

449
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:46,651
Humans disrespected that balance.

450
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:47,736
Abused it.

451
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,489
We will reset the world
to its original plan,

452
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,492
and delete humanity from it.

453
00:24:54,576 --> 00:25:00,040
I'll warn you,
breaking your spell will be quite painful.

454
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,541
Do your worst.

455
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,168
As you wish.

456
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,463
[groans, then screams]

457
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,548
[screams]

458
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,634
[groaning]

459
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,221
- What's wrong?
- They're breaking the spell.

460
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,472
[groaning]

461
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:18,225
- Douxie.
- [whimpers]

462
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,353
[screaming]

463
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,188
Fight it, Nari. Fight it.

464
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,649
[screaming]

465
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,279
It's working.

466
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,455
Trollhunter make Ninth Configuration.

467
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:44,209
[gasps] Krohnisfere will make right.

468
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,877
[gasps] Get it.

469
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,463
Get it!

470
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,136
[gasps in normal voice]

471
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,139
[groans]

472
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,143
- [Archie purring]
- [sighs]

473
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,020
What did you say?

474
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,065
[in normal voice] I didn't say anything.

475
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,150
[groaning]

476
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:14,446
[Toby] And he's back.

477
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,157
I think you said,

478
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,452
"Trollhunter make Ninth Configuration.

479
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,163
- Krohnisfere will make right."
- Huh?

480
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:26,543
- What's the Ninth Configuration?
- What you said. Or she said.

481
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,003
Uh, whoever said it.

482
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,423
Ninth Configuration?
Sounds like an '80s boy band.

483
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,384
But she said "Trollhunter."
Jim, you must know.

484
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,762
I don't.
I'm not the Trollhunter anymore, remember?

485
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,391
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

486
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,980
[enchanting music playing]

487
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,190
[Jim] Whoa.

488
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,236
You guys fixed my amulet.

489
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,447
Actually, it's new and improved.

490
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,866
Built from Merlin's own blueprints.

491
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,910
And a piece of Heartstone
from our homeworld.

492
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,703
Have you tested it?

493
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,457
How could we? You're the Trollhunter.

494
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,209
[Jim] "For the good of all..."

495
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,793
Huh.

496
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,922
Thank you for this.

497
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:16,217
I'll need it.
Douxie, where is the Arcane Order?

498
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,346
- Jim, you're hurt.
- They're about to summon the Titans.

499
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,889
Did you see where they are?

500
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,599
It was dark.

501
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,267
Someplace circular.

502
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,643
That narrows it down.

503
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:29,939
There were seven large doors,
and rails on the ground.

504
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,983
Rails, rails.

505
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:36,112
Circular. It's a roundhouse.
A switching station for locomotives.

506
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,531
- That gives us something to go on.
- Yes.

507
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:41,826
Over 3000 somethings
in North America alone.

508
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,704
Or I can lock on to Nari
and portal us there.

509
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,957
Um, uh...

510
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:49,334
I can do that.

511
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,670
[yells] Yeah!

512
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,092
Where are they?

513
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,303
I connected to her.
She should be right here.

514
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,888
She's right.

515
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:05,683
The bricks, the masonry.
It's the right place, just...

516
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,227
We don't have time to guess.

517
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,271
Everyone, start searching.
We have to find them.

518
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,940
[pensive music playing]

519
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,029
[gasps] Guys, guys!

520
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,280
What? What is it?

521
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,573
I found a penny!

522
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,825
Ai-yai-yai.

523
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,952
I'm afraid they're not here.

524
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,495
But they were here.

525
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:31,584
Bloody balroths, the train tracks.
Maybe they still are.

526
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,631
They didn't leave this place.
It's an illusion.

527
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:39,759
Just as the amulet
mechanizes an incantation,

in the new amulet was from Akiridion-5.

Yes, I took it myself.

647
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,070
The amulet came from Merlin.
The stone needs to carry the same magic.

Everyone was picked for a team
specialized for the task.

702

Blinky didn't know where to place me.

703
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,049
That got us taking stock
of my strengths and weaknesses,

704
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,135
which isn't so great
for the old self-esteem.

705
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,054
- Wanna fight Titans?
- Does it show?

706
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,724
You're with me.
Always have been, always will be.

707
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,018
And I could use some moral support.

708
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:58,437
Ah. The lamest of the superpowers.

709
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:04,318
[mystical music playing]

710
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,991
Well, look who's returned.

711
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,703
Not busy saving the world today, son?

712
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:18,332
If only you knew. We're looking
for something called the Krohnisfere.

713
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:22,294
- [growls] Turn around, Archibald.
- You've heard of it?

714
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:26,715
The Krohnisfere
holds the power of time infinite

715
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:30,845
- and tells of the past and future.
- [gasps]

716
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:34,557
Zong-Shi never averts his gaze from it.

717
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,311
He's convinced it'll show him
the moment of his demise.

718
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:42,314
I don't need to find that ill-fated relic

719
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:46,986
to know only death will come
to those who go looking for it.

720
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:50,698
[Archie] Well, if you don't want
to spend time with your son, then don't.

721
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:54,201
Hmm. Will your cowardly friends
be with you?

722
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,496
Including the troll with many eyes?

723
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,457
The one that screams a lot?

724
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,583
Yes.

725
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,126
In that case...

726
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,211
[screaming]

727
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,387
- [screaming continues]
- [Archie] Oh, relax, Blinky.

728
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,348
Don't you know,
flying's the safest form of travel?

729
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:19,685
I don't think aging dragons
are included in those statistics.

730
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,730
"Aging"? I'm experienced.

731
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:26,525
- Trust me. [laughing]
- [screaming]

732
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:30,946
- All right, all right. I trust you.
- [laughing continues]

733
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,866
I simply love it when he screams.

734
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:36,118
[Claire] Thanks for the assist,
Mr. Charlemagne,

735
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:40,372
but didn't your son tell you I could've
used my magic to shorten the trip?

736
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:46,337
Where would be the fun in that?
Plus, TrollDragons are wary of sorcery.

737
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,882
Their lair is resistant to shadow magic.

738
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:53,844
So we'll have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

739
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:54,928
[yelps]

740
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,682
[Charlemagne]
Welcome to Stonecarver Bridge.

741
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:05,397
Our way into the TrollMarket
is through there!

742

[girl humming]

743
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,069

[Blinky screaming]

[Blinky groaning]

747
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:25,918
- Oh?
- Oh, sweet terra firma.

748
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,379
- [laughing]
- Mwah. Oh, I missed you.

749
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,463
<i>Avant!</i>

750
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,840
No shadow magic,

751
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:35,511
but we are in possession of a horngazel.

752
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:38,264
- [laughs]

[pilot in Mandarin]

754
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,814
- [roars]
- No, don't. They think you're bad guys.

755
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,816
They're the ones pointing weapons.

756
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,192
Brave aviators.

757
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,611
Curious eyes, merciful ears.

758
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,071
Though what appears before you

759
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:57,408
is undoubtedly monstrous,
it pales in comparison for what is next.

760
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:58,909
[pilot]

761
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,831

762
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,750
But our fate is entwined
and predicated on peace.

763
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,507
Love is the one...

764
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,593
[grunting]

765
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,053
Blinky!

Charlemagne!

767
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,771
Let's go.

768
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,155
[Blinky groans]

769
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:43,495
Descriptions of this place
hardly do it justice.

770
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,831
Holy frijole.

771
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,124
Indeed.

772
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,002
"Holy frijole" will have to suffice.

773
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:53,088
[enchanting music playing]

774
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:04,516
[Charlemagne] What is beauty,
if at the cost of others?

775
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,728
Zong-Shi wants everything,

776
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,064
even time itself.

777
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:13,359
All these trolls held against their will.

778
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,985
And for what?

779
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:17,279
He tries to avoid death,

780
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,908
<i>while everyone around him dies.</i>

781
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:24,411
Ah, Charlemagne.

782
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,373
You finally paid me a visit.

783
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,709
[Claire] I just have one question.

784
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:34,588
If this TrollDragon you know
never takes his eyes off the Krohnisfere,

785
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,382
how are we supposed to steal it?

786
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:39,343
[Charlemagne] I figured you'd tell me.

787
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,969
[dramatic music playing]

788
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,014

- Oh, dear.
- [gasps]

791

Cut the pleasantries.

792
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,312
Just take us to your leader.

793
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:55,359
Krel's coordinates show
we should be on top of it.

794
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:58,237
- Maybe his numbers are off.
- What would they be on?

00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,037
I've got this.

Come on.

00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,397
Hold.

00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,233

We'd fall like a rock.

Then again, flying is overrated.

- I know, Mom.

833
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,243

I was wrong, Young Atlas.

To ask you not to be a hero
is like asking the sun not to rise.

That you see things through.

884
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,766
You always have.

885
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,018
Not like your father.

886
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,063
We never talk about him.

887
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,899
I've always wondered.

888
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,694
There's really nothing
I can tell you, Jim.

889
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:57,781
No big revelation I can give you.

890
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,534
No great thing I can say, except...

891
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,161
you're your mother's son.

892
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,996
You will always have me,

893
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,707
and I will always have you.

894
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:12,254
And neither of us ever give up.

[sighs] Hong Kong.

900
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,018
We've lost contact with Claire.

901
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,648
We never give up.

902
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,441

[chuckles] Charlemagne, I never expected
to see you return here.

906
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,597
Old foe. [laughs]

907
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,891
Look at me, you blind fool.

908
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,017
I am looking.

909
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,561
I am always looking.

910
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:14,024
You are an old fool,
seeking to take that which is mine.

911
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,025
Mine, you hear?

912
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:18,528
And your hide will hang here as my trophy.

913
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:23,241
It's all so futile, you see?
No one can see the future coming.

914
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:27,287
I see more than you could know. [chuckles]

915
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,248
You demon. [grunts]

916
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:34,961
And as for your fleshy friend...

917
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,045
[Blinky] No.

918
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:40,842

I shall wear it like an amulet.

920
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,762

Unhand my son, you demon!

The manufacture of Eli's design
took longer than expected.

Eli designed a whole Gun Robot?

Can I keep it and take it to school?

[Varvatos] Stand fast.

966
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:35,683

01:13:08,675 --> 01:13:09,675
You can do it.

1238
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:12,721
[Blinky] Yes, pull.

1239
01:13:17,017 --> 01:13:18,769
Come on, come on, come on.

1240
01:13:18,852 --> 01:13:20,312
[grunting]

1241
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:23,107
[whimpers] I can't watch. [sobs]

1242
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:30,906
[winces]

1243
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:34,284
I really thought that was going to work.

1244
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:38,705
[sighs] We gave your plan a try.

1245
01:13:39,498 --> 01:13:42,418
When my ships arrive, we will evacuate.

1246
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:45,003
- [Eli] Uh, guys?
- [Steve screams]

1247
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,381
[ominous music playing]

1248
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,009
Oh, my gosh. [yelps]

1249
01:13:51,552 --> 01:13:52,678
Now what?

1250
01:14:07,025 --> 01:14:09,528
[Douxie] Oh, fuzzbuckets.

1251
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:13,866
[thunder crashing]

1252
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:15,409
Great Gronka Morka.

1253
01:14:15,492 --> 01:14:16,827
Heartstone.

1254
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:19,037
[Steve screaming]

1255
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:21,498
My insides are coming out!

1256
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:22,749
[screaming]

1257
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:26,253
By Gorgus! What else could go wrong?

1258
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:28,881
Take that back.
Childbirth's a beautiful thing.

1259
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:33,177
You cannot fight in this state,
my beautiful spherical Steve.

1260
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:35,429
But I can't leave him like this.

1261
01:14:35,512 --> 01:14:36,430
Don't worry.

1262
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:37,848
I'll be by his side.

1263
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:43,479
Wait, Aja.
Where do Akiridion babies come out of?

1264
01:14:44,062 --> 01:14:45,522
They come out of... [whispers]

1265
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:46,606
[gasps]

1266
01:14:47,191 --> 01:14:49,359
Okay, I've handled worse.

1267
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:51,361
[screaming]

1268
01:14:52,696 --> 01:14:54,114
[screaming continues]

1269
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,870
"The Trollhunter will know..."
What do I know?

1270
01:14:59,953 --> 01:15:03,540
"The Ninth Configuration."
Okay, nine. What is...?

1271
01:15:03,624 --> 01:15:04,958
Ninth Configuration?

1272
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:07,127
The Ninth Configuration.

1273
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:11,840
[sighs] The Ninth Configuration.

1274
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,802
[stirring music playing]

1275
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:26,438
The configuration is us.

1276
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:30,317
- The nine of us.
- We can pull Excalibur together.

1277
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,949
Everyone, put your hands on the stone.

1278
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:38,325
Surround me.

1279
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:01,723
[grunting]

1280
01:16:20,117 --> 01:16:22,452
[whistling]

1281
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:27,207
Oh, I knew I shouldn't have taken
that bathroom break.

1282
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:32,004
[Jim] Take this back to Camelot.
Replace the amulet stone with Merlin's.

1283
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:34,798
I know it goes unsaid, but make it quick.

1284
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:36,216
Okay, right.

1285
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,141
"Destiny is a gift."

1286
01:16:44,224 --> 01:16:46,893
Our loved ones gave their lives,

1287
01:16:46,977 --> 01:16:51,356
but we are here
in this very moment of quiet desperation.

1288
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:55,402
We've learned that what feels like
a burden pushing down on our shoulders...

1289
01:16:55,485 --> 01:17:00,324
Is actually a sense of purpose
that lifts us to greater heights.

1290
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:03,118
Wait, are you guys doing
that "hero speech" thing?

1291
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:04,995
I love the "hero speech" thing.

1292
01:17:05,078 --> 01:17:09,041
Never forget that fear
is but the precursor to valor.

1293
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:12,127
That to strive
and triumph in the face of fear

1294
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:13,712
is what makes us heroes.

1295
01:17:13,795 --> 01:17:15,255
Don't think.

1296
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:16,381
[all] Become.

[electronic rock music playing]

1300
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:42,741
Ah, how I've missed driving. [laughs]

1301
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:45,911
If we stop Bellroc,
we'll stop the Fire Titan.

1302
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,038
Blinky, we need to be right next to it.

1303
01:17:48,121 --> 01:17:52,376
You want us to get on top of that thing?
I can't get to the top of the rope in gym.

1304
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:55,087
Don't worry, I've got just the thing.

1305
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,880
<i>Lignum Aeternum.</i>

1306
01:17:56,963 --> 01:17:58,131
Whoa!

1307
01:17:58,215 --> 01:17:59,549
What was that?

1308
01:17:59,633 --> 01:18:01,134
I feel all tingly.

1309
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:02,469
Uh, uh...

1310
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:03,762

[laughs]

1312
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:09,768
Some sort of magical stickum.
Varvatos approves.

1313
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:13,939
Let's knock Bellroc off her perch.

1314
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:24,282
- [screaming]
- [horn blares "La Cucaracha"]

1315
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,869
Slow down, Blinky.

1316
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:28,953
Get closer.

1317
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:31,707
[Blinky] Prepare yourselves.

1318
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,291
- Now!
- [tires screech]

1319
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:36,002
[Jim] All right, Trollhunters, get ready.

1320
01:18:36,086 --> 01:18:37,129
Now.

1321
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:41,258
[chuckles] Oh, boy.

1322
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:42,926
[all scream]

1323
01:18:44,886 --> 01:18:47,556
- Come on, Trollhunters!
- [Krel] Yeah!

1324
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:49,850
Godspeed, my valiant...

1325
01:18:49,933 --> 01:18:51,017
[Toby] Come on!

1326
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:56,273
Okay, [chuckles] I think he may have laid
that magic on a little too thick.

1327
01:18:56,356 --> 01:18:59,401
[groans] Why does this always
happen to me?

[dramatic music playing]

1329
01:19:08,368 --> 01:19:09,786
Aja, scout ahead.

1330
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:10,871
On it.

[Steve] What are you doing, Pepperjack?
Get back here!

1334
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:27,554
Don't worry. I'm here.

1335
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:29,848
- Creepslayerz for life.
- Yeah.

1336
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,433
- Creepslayerz for...

1342
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:46,364
[Eli] I take it back.
Childbirth is not so beautiful.

01:20:17,854 --> 01:20:20,106
Trollhunters.

1347
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:24,110
But you cannot hunt a god.

Oh, no, no, no!

Come on, Stuart. Where are you?

01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:58,705
Don't make them like they used to.
Come on.

1375
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:01,666
Pop this stone into the amulet, et voilà.

[growls] So disappointing.

1381
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:45,168
You are unworthy to face a god, child.

1382
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:55,387
He's alone, no armor.

1383
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,514
We need to help him.

- I've tried. I'm spent.

No, I'm right where I need to be.

You have no amulet, no armor.

[Jim] Your turn.

1417

Master Jim, if you do this,

01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:16,299
you alone will be burdened
by what could have been.

Have at it, Romeo.

this will be worth my while.

Take the canal.

1592
01:37:35,057 --> 01:37:38,060
Maybe you'll stumble
upon something interesting.

1593
01:37:38,143 --> 01:37:40,020
[chuckles] Yeah, right, Jim.

1594
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:42,439
Nothing interesting
ever happens in Arcadia.

1595
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:44,066
[school bell rings]

1596
01:37:45,192 --> 01:37:49,405
I'm James Lake, Jr.,
here to try out for the part of Romeo.

1597
01:37:49,488 --> 01:37:51,448
Go ahead, Mr. Lake.

1598
01:37:55,411 --> 01:37:56,495
[sighs]

1599
01:37:56,579 --> 01:37:58,080
[stirring music playing]

1600
01:37:58,831 --> 01:38:00,749
Destiny... [chuckles]

1601
01:38:03,085 --> 01:38:05,170
<i>Destiny is a gift.</i>

1602
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:09,758
<i>Some go their entire lives</i>

1603
01:38:09,842 --> 01:38:12,636
<i>living an existence of quiet desperation.</i>

1604
01:38:14,263 --> 01:38:16,307
<i>Never learning the truth.</i>

1605
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:21,061
That what feels as though a burden
pushing down upon our shoulders

1606
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:25,482
is actually the sense of purpose
that lifts us to greater heights.

1607
01:38:27,276 --> 01:38:31,363
<i>Never forget that fear
is but the precursor to valor.</i>

1608
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:35,492
<i>That to strive
and triumph in the face of fear</i>

1609
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:38,245
<i>is what it means to be a hero.</i>

1610
01:38:40,914 --> 01:38:42,082
[Toby] Whoa.

1611
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:44,043
[Jim]<i> Don't think.</i>

1612
01:38:44,126 --> 01:38:47,338
- [amulet] <i>Tobias Domzalski.</i>
- [gasps]

1613
01:38:48,631 --> 01:38:49,632
[Jim] <i>Become.</i>

1614
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:51,216
[laughs]

1615
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:53,135
Awesomesauce!

1616
01:38:55,638 --> 01:38:57,640
[dramatic music playing]
