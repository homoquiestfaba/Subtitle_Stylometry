1
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:16,617
So this box
still needs to be labeled.

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,950
And then these will be wrapped

3
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:19,453
as a series of three.

4
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:22,623
Oh! No, no, no. No.

5
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,058
That piece stays here.

6
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:25,402
It's just the Michaud
and the Vasquez

7
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:26,427
that need packing.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,661
And please wrap them tight.

9
00:00:27,795 --> 00:00:29,463
No wiggle room. Okay?

10
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:32,466
Hey, it's me.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,301
Hey, Liv.

12
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:34,668
Just calling to check in

13
00:00:34,802 --> 00:00:36,282
to make sure
everything's on schedule?

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,514
As long as
the carrier's not late,

15
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,872
I will be on the plane by 3:00

16
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,250
and back in time for Thai night.

17
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,142
Great, because I have some news.

18
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:42,476
What is it?

19
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,145
I'll tell you when you get here.

20
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:45,958
I've got to go,
but I will see you at home.

21
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:50,484
You can't leave me
hanging like that.

22
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:51,685
Amber.

23
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,988
All right, we can't be late,

24
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:56,490
so let's get these on the truck.

25
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:15,309
Hey!

26
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:37,465
Amber, I'm home.

27
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,899
I'll be right out.

28
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,334
Sorry if the food got cold.

29
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:42,436
My flight got delayed.

30
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:47,039
By the way,
I officially hate my job.

31
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:50,511
You hated it before you left.

32
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,314
This last tour confirmed it.

33
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,749
I'm essentially a UPS service
for the gallery.

34
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:58,686
Hey, maybe that's
what I should do.

35
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,421
Deliver mail
here in the neighborhood.

36
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:01,789
Then I wouldn't have to

37
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,357
miss out on my latte
from Jump start

38
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,058
or my best friend
in the whole world.

39
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:08,396
Or you could work on your art.

40
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:11,899
I don't want to talk about that.

41
00:02:12,032 --> 00:02:13,672
What I do want to talk about
is your news.

42
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,170
Hold that thought.
It's open.

43
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:17,871
Why? Is that Justin?

44
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,605
He'd better not
know this news before me.

45
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:23,277
- Hey!
- Hey.

46
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,918
Liv, you remember Dylan, right?

47
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,254
Oh, yeah, yeah.

48
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,187
You two were, like,
hanging out before I left.

49
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,090
Yeah, yeah.

50
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:38,759
It's good
to see you again, Olivia.

51
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:40,332
And, ooh, I see the food
has arrived.

52
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,273
Dylan's been joining me
for Thai night

53
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:44,465
while you've been away.

54
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,767
Oh.

55
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,302
That's great.

56
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:51,605
You haven't told her?

57
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:52,773
Told me what?

58
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:54,942
Um...

59
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:56,744
As you may recall,

60
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:57,911
Dylan's been in New York

61
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,680
sourcing some new
equipment suppliers,

62
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,758
but now he has to go back
to his ranch in Wyoming,

63
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:03,317
and...

64
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,219
he asked me to go with him!

65
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:06,520
Is that?

66
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:07,654
Are you?

67
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:10,223
We are.

68
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:11,525
We're engaged!

69
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:20,133
Hi. Excuse me.

70
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:21,669
Dylan.

71
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:23,203
Dylan? Hi.

72
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:25,839
Do you mind just giving us
several moments alone, please?

73
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,908
Yeah. Yeah.

74
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,043
Babe, I'll go
for a walk around the block.

75
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:31,545
Thank you.

76
00:03:36,116 --> 00:03:39,119
Amber, you two met,
like, four weeks ago.

77
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,821
Six.

78
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:41,822
Okay, and, you know,

79
00:03:41,954 --> 00:03:43,156
it was all casual

80
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,692
because he wasn't staying,
and...

81
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,293
Then I go away for three weeks,

82
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,662
and I come back
and you're engaged.

83
00:03:48,796 --> 00:03:50,440
I didn't plan on falling
head over heels for him,

84
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,332
but I did,

85
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,434
and honestly?

86
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,887
This is the most excited
I've been

87
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:55,968
in, like, forever.

88
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:59,906
So please, please
be happy for me.

89
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:02,075
Of course, I'm happy for you.

90
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,076
Come here.

91
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,646
Thank you.

92
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,558
You totally got that.

93
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:18,892
I know.
I totally did.

94
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:22,796
You are so not happy for her.

95
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,930
Well, of course not.

96
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,265
But what can I say?

97
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,643
She asked me to be
her maid of honor.

98
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,035
Well, you two are like sisters.

99
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,337
Exactly.

100
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,580
Sisters don't just
spring it on you

101
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,905
that they're getting married

102
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,541
and moving away
to go live on a ranch.

103
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,810
Plus, we're city girls.

104
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:37,778
This is what we do.

105
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:38,779
We hang out here,

106
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,047
we go to yoga,

107
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,549
we get coffee and takeout,

108
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,150
and we talk about

109
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,203
all the amazing things
we're going to do one day.

110
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:52,058
Well, as unhappy as you are,

111
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,094
you still have to plan
a bachelorette party.

112
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,796
So...

113
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,206
what about, like,
a Western theme?

114
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,499
Seriously?

115
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,267
If Amber wants
to go live on a ranch,

116
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,735
she needs to know

117
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,413
it's not going to be
all cute boots and hats.

118
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:04,648
I mean, they have
black widow spiders

119
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,340
that live in Wyoming.

120
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,342
That girl can't handle
anything creepy-crawly,

121
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:10,878
so how's that
for a reality check?

122
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:14,782
Oh, my gosh.
That's it.

123
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:15,949
What?

124
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:17,885
As maid of honor,

125
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,620
I am in charge
of planning a sendoff,

126
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:23,591
so I am going to plan
not just a party

127
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,926
but a surprise
bachelorette getaway.

128
00:05:27,895 --> 00:05:30,464
One that will show Amber
what a big mistake she's making.

129
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:37,805
Thank you so much.

130
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:38,972
You're welcome.

131
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:44,577
Okay, Liv.

132
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:45,746
We're at the airport.

133
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:47,159
Are you finally going to tell us

134
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,782
where the surprise trip is?

135
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,419
Check your phones.
I just sent the itineraries.

136
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:53,821
Dude ranch?

137
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,188
That's right.

138
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:56,790
Surprise.

139
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:59,527
Is this not the most epic
bachelorette getaway ever?

140
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,828
Because seriously,

141
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:01,762
dude ranches are hot right now.

142
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:02,963
Oh.

143
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,231
It is busy season,

144
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,833
but lucky for us,

145
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,243
they just opened their doors
to the public.

146
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:08,368
Sure, but, I mean,

147
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:09,679
you could have at least told me

148
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,238
so I didn't pack
all of my heels.

149
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,641
Sorry, but you're going
to have to get used to that.

150
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:14,918
Seeing as you won't need
all your cute heels

151
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,102
once you live in the country.

152
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,388
But I'm sure we can get you
some boots on the way.

153
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:19,412
Oh.

154
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:20,914
I just Googled,

155
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,759
and Yellowstone Airport
has a Western boutique.

156
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:23,817
They've got cowboy hats.

157
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:24,718
Ooh.

158
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:26,420
Ooh, they even have spurs.

159
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,522
See? We're all set.

160
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:29,857
All right, let's giddy-up.

161
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,879
Oh, my gosh.

162
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,750
This dude ranch is amazing.

163
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,697
Welcome to Big Sky.

164
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,065
I'm Wade McCleary.

165
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,967
Nice to meet you,
Mr. McCleary.

166
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,235
I'm Olivia,

167
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,048
and these are my friends,
Amber and Justin.

168
00:07:50,704 --> 00:07:51,805
It's a pleasure,

169
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:52,939
and please, call me Wade.

170
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:56,143
I've brewed up
some fresh iced tea.

171
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,945
Okay.

172
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:13,961
Mm, mm, mm.

173
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,974
Now, doesn't that taste
just like a country day?

174
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,498
Oh, there's my boy now.

175
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,236
What?

176
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,507
Thanks.

177
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:30,077
Travis, our guests have arrived.

178
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:34,280
This here is Olivia,
Amber, and Justin.

179
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:35,683
Nice to meet y'all.

180
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:41,288
These folks came
all the way from...

181
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,289
Where is it you came from?

182
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:43,991
New York City.

183
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,124
The Big Apple.

184
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,495
So...

185
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,130
any of you ever live

186
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,474
or work
out in the country before?

187
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:53,233
Oh, heck no,

188
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,268
but Amber here

189
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:58,706
is getting married
and moving to a ranch.

190
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,874
Probably just like this one.

191
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,176
So no experience, then,

192
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,245
riding horses
or handling cattle?

193
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,680
Let's put it this way.

194
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,148
The only experience we have

195
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,617
is dressing up

196
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,510
for the pub's Western-themed
Halloween party.

197
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:14,788
Are those the clothes you wore?

198
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:17,591
Oh, is this not...

199
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,492
I think we've got the picture

200
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:21,228
that these here folks

201
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,897
are in for a new
and exciting adventure.

202
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:27,267
And seeing as
you're our very first guests,

203
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
so are we.

204
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:29,870
Am I right, Travis?

205
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,172
Yeah, actually,

206
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,074
I have been
horseback riding before.

207
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,442
I took lessons.

208
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,610
- Really?
- Yeah.

209
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:38,078
When?

210
00:09:38,211 --> 00:09:39,889
Those two summers
I went to Camp Washonagin

211
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,153
when you were in summer school.

212
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,281
Well, that's something.

213
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,751
Right, Travis?

214
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:44,985
I guess so.

215
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:46,987
Now, how about

216
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,856
you graciously show our guests

217
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,190
to their lodgings?

218
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,358
Of course.

219
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:52,893
Follow me.

220
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:56,162
Okay.

221
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,939
Here you are.

222
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:09,376
Ooh, rustic chic.

223
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,011
I like it.

224
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,684
Are these handmade?

225
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,452
Yeah, by my mom and grandmother.

226
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,754
Authentic.

227
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,048
That is exactly what we want.

228
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,658
All right.

229
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:27,728
Well, you've got
a few amenities.

230
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:30,664
Radio, coffee maker...

231
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:32,399
And the ladies' room would be...

232
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:33,532
That door right there.

233
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,135
Ah. Phew.

234
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:37,137
I was a bit worried
we might have an outhouse.

235
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,973
We're not totally
in the Dark Ages,

236
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,275
but since you're asking,
the shower is outdoors.

237
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,853
But don't worry.
It's completely private.

238
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,378
Yeah, and Wi-Fi?

239
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,882
Because I have to get
in touch with my fiancé.

240
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,452
Oh, my gosh, fiancé.
It sounds so weird.

241
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:53,754
Well, it kind of is.

242
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,224
She got engaged in,
like, four weeks.

243
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,892
Six... weeks, actually.

244
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:02,863
Now I'll leave y'all
to get settled.

245
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,356
But dinner should
be ready shortly.

246
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,466
You'll be notified
by the dinner bell.

247
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,668
So unless there's
anything else I missed...

248
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,171
Well, how about a tour?

249
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,273
You know, of the ranch,

250
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,742
so we can get a lay of the land.

251
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,410
Oh, sure.

252
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:19,088
Yeah, I'm going to have
to take a rain check

253
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,281
on that until
after I call Dylan.

254
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,449
I'm out, too.

255
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:23,884
I've got to put my feet up

256
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,361
after wearing
these bad boys all day.

257
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,989
I guess it's just
me and you, cowboy.

258
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,390
Sorry.

259
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,003
Is that politically
not correct, or...

260
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:34,828
I'll meet you out by the corral.

261
00:11:35,963 --> 00:11:37,230
Yes, sir.

262
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,500
Is it just me,
or is he a bit rough?

263
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,070
If you mean prickly
as a cactus out here,

264
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,271
then yeah.

265
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:49,141
Citiots.

266
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,283
I'm guessing this is the corral.

267
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,122
Hey there.

268
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,227
You're pretty as a picture
with those big old soft eyes.

269
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,764
That's it.

270
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,365
You want to take
a picture with me?

271
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,036
Wait, I don't see you.

272
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,138
Here, I'll just move
this way a little bit.

273
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,208
Whoa!

274
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:25,912
Oh...

275
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:30,918
Need a hand?

276
00:12:31,051 --> 00:12:32,986
Yeah. Thanks.

277
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,164
That's good.

278
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,467
So I guess you figured out

279
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,203
here's where we keep the cows
and Cyclone the bull.

280
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,404
Cyclone?

281
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:53,874
Because he can be a bit...

282
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:54,842
unpredictable.

283
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,910
Right.

284
00:12:58,345 --> 00:12:59,880
So are these
all the cows you have?

285
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,982
Most are out to pasture.

286
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,185
Then what else
other than the corral?

287
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:09,322
Well, we keep the horses
in the barn over there.

288
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,058
Hen coops are just in behind it.

289
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,793
And we keep the pigs
over in that barn.

290
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,262
So...

291
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:17,630
other than 10,000 acres of land,

292
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,532
this here's about it.

293
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,970
So we're your first guests, huh?

294
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,838
That's right.

295
00:13:24,972 --> 00:13:27,074
My dad put the ranch up on...

296
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:28,942
Trippy? Or Tripster?

297
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:29,943
TripAdvisor?

298
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:32,579
Sure. Whatever.

299
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:34,781
I can see that
this whole hospitality thing

300
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,083
is kind of new to you.

301
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,489
Ha. Saved by the dinner bell.

302
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:47,460
Well, thank you
for pointing everything out,

303
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:49,429
and I guess
I will see you at dinner.

304
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,563
Which is...

305
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:54,067
Outside the farmhouse.

306
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,903
I'll see y'all there.

307
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,147
Thank you.

308
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:15,155
Wow, those were
some serious steaks.

309
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:18,458
I guess I should have asked
if any of you are vegetarian.

310
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,626
None here.

311
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,028
Good thing,

312
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,495
because out here,

313
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:25,798
we fuel up
on meat, meat, and more meat.

314
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:28,168
Keeps us going
from dawn till dusk.

315
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,437
And speaking
of days on the ranch,

316
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,572
is that what one should expect

317
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,174
living like this?

318
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,976
I mean, getting up at dawn

319
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:38,645
and working on chores
all day until dusk?

320
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,813
Well, that's about right,
wouldn't you say, Travis?

321
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:42,415
Pretty much.

322
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,883
Wow.

323
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,777
So I guess vacations
are out of the question.

324
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,721
Like my grandpa used to say,

325
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,157
"If you want to be a rancher,

326
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,890
you've got to stay home
and do the work."

327
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,593
Wow.

328
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,726
Sounds tough.

329
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,329
Definitely a way of life.

330
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:59,199
So what's on the itinerary?

331
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:02,069
I mean, we are celebrating
a soon-to-be bride.

332
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,671
Maybe some games
or some trail riding?

333
00:15:04,804 --> 00:15:05,838
Do you have a pool?

334
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:07,907
Uh, no.

335
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,041
No pool.

336
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,078
But we do have a river

337
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,545
that runs through our property.

338
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,515
I'm sure we could plan
an outing out there

339
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:16,984
if we all manage

340
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,319
to finish what needs
to get done around here.

341
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,454
Wait.

342
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,068
Is this another
bachelorette surprise?

343
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,544
I'm actually talking
about chores.

344
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,960
Huh?

345
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:29,529
Because y'all booked
a working dude ranch.

346
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,231
You know that, right?

347
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,266
Working?

348
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,601
What does that mean, exactly?

349
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,236
Well, it means fun.

350
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,505
Getting your hands dirty,
your boots scuffed up.

351
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:41,474
So you're saying

352
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:45,145
we're actually
working the ranch?

353
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,714
That is the experience
you signed up for

354
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,217
on a "working" dude ranch.

355
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,264
Partaking in all the things

356
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,520
that make a place like this

357
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,722
run as smooth as a cattle drive.

358
00:15:55,855 --> 00:15:57,590
Did I not tell you guys

359
00:15:57,724 --> 00:15:59,226
that this is
a working dude ranch?

360
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:00,093
No.

361
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:01,528
No, you did not.

362
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:04,897
Then, in that case,
Amber's right.

363
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:06,399
It is another surprise.

364
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:07,567
Don't worry.

365
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,012
I'm sure you'll find
your stay here

366
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:10,737
will be more than memorable.

367
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:11,738
Right, Travis?

368
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:13,540
No doubt.

369
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,208
I mean, what better way

370
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:16,552
than to get our bride-to-be
ready for her new life?

371
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:17,444
Am I right?

372
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:19,546
This is amazing.

373
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,249
It's so kind of you.

374
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,670
Well, that's what
best friends are for.

375
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,153
Well, here.

376
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,286
A toast, then.

377
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:30,023
To gettin' 'er done.

378
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:33,160
Starting tomorrow
at the crack of dawn.

379
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,763
Maybe we should
just call it a night.

380
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:37,997
Yeah, good idea.

381
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:52,945
What? What is it?

382
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,347
Am I late for work?

383
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:55,915
It is time to get up.

384
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,451
Let the bachelorette festivities
begin.

385
00:16:58,585 --> 00:16:59,452
Right.

386
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,121
Yeah. I'm up.

387
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,422
Are you up?

388
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,157
That's great.
I'm totally up.

389
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,162
Uh.

390
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,265
What? What's going on?

391
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:17,170
Why is it still dark out?

392
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,711
I don't know
if this was such a good plan.

393
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,480
Turning this place
into some kind of hotel.

394
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,414
Like, we're ranchers, Dad,
not event planners.

395
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:33,052
Look, I know you haven't
been keen on the idea,

396
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,655
but it's a way
to bring in more cash,

397
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,624
and right now
that's what we need.

398
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:39,626
So look at the bright side.

399
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,631
I guess.

400
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,534
I just wish Mom were here.

401
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,387
Because she'd be
so much better at all this.

402
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,604
But hey,

403
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,440
at least you're broadening
your horizons

404
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,709
and getting to know some new
and interesting folks.

405
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:27,840
Definitely interesting.

406
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,648
You all right?

407
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,484
Please tell me
there's hot water.

408
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,718
Of course.

409
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,028
It just takes a little while
to heat up

410
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:41,754
and travel out this way.

411
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,723
But I've got to warn you,
it's a small tank,

412
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,425
so you want to have
a quick shower

413
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,093
so there's enough
for all three of you.

414
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:48,228
Okay.

415
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,196
So are you good?

416
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,329
Yeah.

417
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:51,397
Yeah, I'm good.

418
00:18:51,498 --> 00:18:52,665
Well, when you're done,

419
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,999
I'll meet you over at the barn

420
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:55,568
Mm-hmm.

421
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:56,769
All right.

422
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,624
How was the shower
the second time around?

423
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,459
It was...

424
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,927
better.

425
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,462
Where are Amber and Justin?

426
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,331
They're off with my dad
filling the troughs.

427
00:19:24,464 --> 00:19:26,333
- Ah.
- You and I are on eggs.

428
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,436
Just make sure
you ignore the rooster.

429
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:31,238
You don't want
to ruffle his feathers.

430
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,439
What will he do?

431
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,274
Protect his turf.

432
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,277
Now, we like to collect
eggs twice a day.

433
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,911
Once early,

434
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:41,005
and then again later
to help keep the nests clean.

435
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:43,783
So here, why don't you
collect what we've got?

436
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:44,916
And be careful.

437
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,853
This is part of breakfast.

438
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,187
Got it.

439
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,292
So what do you do in the city?

440
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:56,062
I'm a registrar
for the Norton Art Gallery.

441
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,064
It sounds a lot fancier
than it is.

442
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,632
You always done that?

443
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,534
Oh, gosh, no.

444
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,403
I've been a theater usher.

445
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,816
That was while I was in college.

446
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,139
Then I worked as a receptionist

447
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:08,575
for the Museum of Art.

448
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,677
And then I worked
at another art gallery

449
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,379
before I landed
the registrar job.

450
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:15,782
So I'm guessing
you enjoy the arts?

451
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:19,051
Well, maybe not packing them
with duct tape,

452
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,620
but yeah, I do.

453
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,994
I'm guessing you've
always done this? Ranching?

454
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,825
Yep.

455
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:26,958
Born and raised.

456
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,772
Actually, I've never lived
outside of Main and Seventh.

457
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:33,366
What is that,
about seven square blocks?

458
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,268
- About that.
- Huh.

459
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:39,606
So seven square blocks is,

460
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:40,507
let's see,

461
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,542
it's about 482 acres.

462
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:43,743
Yeah?

463
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,713
And out here,
we've got over 10,000.

464
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,658
Sounds to me like your world
in the big city

465
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,017
isn't really all that big.

466
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,319
This is all just...

467
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:53,586
land.

468
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,356
I mean, we've got so much.

469
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:59,392
Like this little coffee shop
on the corner

470
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,028
that makes
the most incredible lattes.

471
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,996
And then our local pub
right down the street.

472
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,698
And the best place
to get a mani-pedi.

473
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:07,567
This is all really nice,

474
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,570
but it's just, you know.

475
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:11,538
Nope.

476
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:12,672
I don't.

477
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,909
Looks like your
friend's settling in.

478
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:22,591
Well, that's
just because so far,

479
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,016
it's been like a petting zoo.

480
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,528
I mean, when do we get
really down and dirty?

481
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:26,586
It's coming.

482
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:27,719
Okay.

483
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:30,468
Oh, don't put it up there.
It's not very...

484
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:33,593
Oh!

485
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:34,726
Stable.

486
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:40,900
All right, folks.

487
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:43,235
Unfortunately, this morning,
we don't have any eggs.

488
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,737
But there's still plenty to eat,

489
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:47,039
so double up,
and then we'll get to work.

490
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:50,986
I mean,
it's probably a good thing

491
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,345
we don't have any eggs.

492
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,556
I think we've got enough
saturated fats here

493
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,620
to last a lifetime, right?

494
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:58,184
How are the new recruits?

495
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,752
Or should I say guests?

496
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:01,687
Just what I thought.

497
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:02,989
That good, huh?

498
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,258
I'll help you
whip them into shape.

499
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:07,794
I figured I could count on you.

500
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,061
Always.

501
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:13,876
When you've had enough to eat,

502
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,334
I'll meet y'all at the barn

503
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:16,102
so you can get to know
your horses.

504
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,670
Great.

505
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,640
All right.

506
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:28,615
Oh, and mucking the stalls
is really no big deal.

507
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:29,616
Oh, look. Horses.

508
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,317
You three ready to ride?

509
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:32,819
Gang, this is Kat.

510
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,392
She's been my right hand
on the ranch

511
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:35,421
since I can remember.

512
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:36,589
And sometimes his left.

513
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:39,859
All right.

514
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:41,761
Amber, this here'll be
your horse, Blaze.

515
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,696
Don't worry.

516
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,030
She's not as fast as her name,

517
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:46,064
but she handles well.

518
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:48,300
And Toro can be yours.

519
00:22:48,435 --> 00:22:50,336
Toro? Like, as in bull?

520
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,138
He's a bit stubborn, that's all.

521
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:53,271
Where's my horse?

522
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,372
Right over there.

523
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:55,775
This here's Daisy.

524
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,548
She's beautiful.

525
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:02,915
And that mane!

526
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,226
Girl, we need
to talk conditioners

527
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,518
to make that shine.

528
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:08,788
All right, then.

529
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:10,466
How about we hop on
and get a feel for riding,

530
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,770
seeing as
at the end of the week,

531
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:12,659
we've got a cattle drive
to conquer.

532
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:14,026
I'm sorry. A what?

533
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,528
Cattle drive.

534
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,764
You know, when you round up
all the cattle

535
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,399
and lead them out to pasture
for the season?

536
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,169
And you want us to do that?

537
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:27,707
It is what needs to get done
around here, so...

538
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,508
yeah.

539
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:29,776
I'm game.

540
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,878
- Let's get practicing.
- Yeah.

541
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:33,546
Let's do it.

542
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:36,683
Yeah.

543
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,184
Just put your foot
in the stirrup.

544
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,995
- Here, I'll help.
- I'm trying. I just can't...

545
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,187
Okay. Okay.

546
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,655
- There you go.
- Yep, okay.

547
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,232
And hang on to the reins
with the other hand.

548
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,492
- You got it?
- Mm-hmm.

549
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:47,819
There you go.
Great job.

550
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:48,895
Thanks.

551
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:51,397
I think I can... Okay.

552
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:52,899
- There you go. Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

553
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:54,333
All right.
Are you good?

554
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,747
- Yeah.
- You're good. All right.

555
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,670
Now if you're ready,

556
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:58,671
we'll go for
a bit of a trail ride.

557
00:23:58,805 --> 00:23:59,872
Kat'll take the rear

558
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:01,286
so none of y'all
will wander off,

559
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,575
and I'll take the lead.

560
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,686
Okay, but hear me out.

561
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,330
I'm really thinking
if her mane was on the right,

562
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,999
it would really frame
her face a lot better.

563
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:19,025
Yes, yes.

564
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,595
This is stunning.

565
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:24,130
Good girl, Daisy!

566
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:26,599
Do you think you could
take a few photos for us?

567
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:27,934
Uh, yeah. Sure.

568
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:33,039
So I'm curious.

569
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,812
What would make you turn
your family ranch

570
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:36,876
into, like, a vacation spot?

571
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,945
It was actually my dad's idea.

572
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:41,614
He just thought
it would be great

573
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:43,091
to share all this
with folks like you.

574
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,952
What does that mean,
folk like me?

575
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:47,854
You know,

576
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:51,558
people who don't know
anything about...

577
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:53,726
well, all this.

578
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:56,796
Right.

579
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:00,266
And did you think
it was a good idea?

580
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,171
What was that?

581
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,540
Wolves.

582
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:08,994
Don't worry.
They won't bother us.

583
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:11,844
I think it's a good idea

584
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,221
if I go and get that cow
and her new calf

585
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:14,245
from the north pasture.

586
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,849
All right, listen up.

587
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:18,783
Seeing as this is
your first lesson in riding,

588
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,219
we're just going to sit tight

589
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,992
and let Kat head out
to the north pasture.

590
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:24,056
Sounds good to me.

591
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,391
No, no, no, no, no.

592
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,869
This is what
we came here for, right?

593
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,027
To dig into ranch life

594
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,696
and learn what it's really like.

595
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,349
So come on.
Let's giddy-up and do this.

596
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,666
- No, Olivia!
- Olivia, don't!

597
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,867
Stay here.

598
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,707
What is it?

599
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:58,290
Olivia.

600
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:06,666
You all right?

601
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,000
Yeah. I just...

602
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:09,335
I couldn't hang on anymore.

603
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:10,837
Don't worry.

604
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,180
We'll take it nice and slow
on the ride back.

605
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:13,372
Oh, no, no, no.

606
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,983
I am not getting back
on that horse right now.

607
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:15,541
No way.

608
00:26:15,675 --> 00:26:18,077
All right, then.

609
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,712
Looks like we're walking back.

610
00:26:28,655 --> 00:26:30,699
It was just like
Manhattan on a Friday night.

611
00:26:30,723 --> 00:26:31,891
And then,

612
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:33,359
I cut to the right of the cows,

613
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:34,737
but it charged
in the opposite direction.

614
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:35,995
But I got a hold of it,

615
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,448
and I drove it back
to the others.

616
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:40,599
I mean, do we really have
to hear all day

617
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:43,069
about how she wrangled,
like, one cow?

618
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,113
I mean, there's all this tack

619
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:46,238
that needs cleaning, so...

620
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:47,239
Why don't you leave that,

621
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:48,641
and I'll show y'all

622
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:50,175
how we release tension
from the day.

623
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,045
Great.

624
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:55,848
Uh, Amber, I'm going
to help you with this tack.

625
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:00,920
So let me guess.
Now it's time to chop wood?

626
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,254
Nope.

627
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:04,068
We are going to throw these
at that target.

628
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:05,624
Oh.

629
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:06,926
Kind of like darts.

630
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,127
Kinda.

631
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,962
Well then, you are in
for a surprise

632
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:11,831
because we play
every weekend at McCool's,

633
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,866
and I've got to say,
I'm pretty good.

634
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,301
All right, champ.

635
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,369
Have at 'er.

636
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:18,738
So why do I get the feeling

637
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:19,982
you don't want
your friend, Amber,

638
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:21,126
to get the hang of all this?

639
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,142
Well, there's nothing to tell.

640
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:26,212
Except that my best friend
is getting married

641
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,345
and moving to a ranch,

642
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:28,981
so I just thought

643
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:32,484
that bringing her here
would be like a test run.

644
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:34,754
Well, I won't argue
if you're having your doubts.

645
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:36,047
What's that supposed to mean?

646
00:27:36,122 --> 00:27:38,424
You three
are from the city, so...

647
00:27:38,557 --> 00:27:39,425
This might not be your thing.

648
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:40,760
Really?

649
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:43,062
Well then, watch this.

650
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:50,402
Hmm. Not bad.

651
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,742
Meh. It was okay.

652
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,344
So...

653
00:27:58,477 --> 00:28:01,447
what does your friend, Amber,
do in the city?

654
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,115
She's an insurance broker.

655
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,517
But she hates her job
just as much as I do.

656
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:07,854
What do you want to be doing?

657
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:10,656
Well, if I could pick
my dream job,

658
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,858
I would be an artist,

659
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:14,026
but that's crazy.

660
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,329
Like leaving insurance
to go live on a ranch?

661
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:18,831
Yes, exactly.

662
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:20,867
Except your friend's
giving it a shot,

663
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,368
so what if you did?

664
00:28:25,004 --> 00:28:27,706
Well, I did.

665
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,341
I brought one of my paintings

666
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:30,977
to the gallery I work at,

667
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,344
and Demetrie Faust,

668
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:35,281
who is one of
my favorite artists,

669
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:37,449
said that it looked "amateur".

670
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,519
Hmm.

671
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:42,021
Well...

672
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,990
for what it's worth,

673
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:45,443
you did all right
out there today.

674
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,128
Thanks, but now
you're just saying things.

675
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:51,764
If you fall off your horse,

676
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,008
you've just got
to pick up the reins

677
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:54,333
and get back in the saddle.

678
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:57,061
Otherwise, you'll never
be able to ride.

679
00:29:08,047 --> 00:29:09,181
I am so sorry.

680
00:29:09,315 --> 00:29:10,416
Hey, Dad.

681
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,018
Hey, son.

682
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,753
City folk.

683
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,405
Hey, your dad sent me out here

684
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:35,074
to do some fencing work.

685
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,487
I guess that's
what you're doing?

686
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:37,844
Yep.

687
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,912
Not exactly exciting,
but necessary.

688
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,281
Here.

689
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:43,725
Why don't I show you
how it's done?

690
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,084
Uh, I may be from the city,

691
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:47,019
but I think I know
how to hammer a nail.

692
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:49,956
All right.

693
00:29:58,364 --> 00:29:59,531
See? Ta-dah.

694
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,537
Why would you do that?

695
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:07,215
Because the fencing
has to be good and secure

696
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:08,679
or else an animal
can get through it.

697
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:10,877
Here.

698
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:15,982
So the beautiful thing
about fencing

699
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:18,217
is that you can do it
on your own.

700
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,353
It's like a seesaw effect.

701
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:22,788
You get the one side in,

702
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,032
and then you lift it up
on the other.

703
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:25,224
Go ahead.

704
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:29,028
Drive it straight through
and into the post.

705
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:31,163
There you go.

706
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:32,131
Not bad.

707
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,000
And I'm not just saying that.

708
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:44,376
Is this all you've ever done?

709
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,344
Ranching?

710
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:46,612
Yep.

711
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:48,314
Hmm.

712
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:51,550
Do you ever find that

713
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,619
doing the same thing
day in and day out,

714
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:55,121
it gets a little,

715
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:57,789
I don't know, boring?

716
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,903
I mean, it doesn't seem like
you have a lot of time for fun.

717
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:02,428
We have our ways.

718
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:05,932
Besides, I like what I do.

719
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,135
What about you?

720
00:31:09,268 --> 00:31:10,536
What do you do for fun,

721
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:13,739
other than darts
at this McCool's place?

722
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,174
Oh, we do lots of things.

723
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:18,877
Every Friday,

724
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:20,846
Amber and I order in Thai

725
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,814
from this amazing takeout place.

726
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:24,583
Mondays, we go
to the meditation lab

727
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,018
for yoga.

728
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:27,319
Wednesdays is movie night,

729
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:28,955
and Thursdays we do laundry.

730
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,357
Sounds to me

731
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,330
like you do the same things
day in and day out.

732
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:36,462
Well, call me boring,
but today's Monday.

733
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,166
And that means
topping up the manure.

734
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:43,135
We can come back to this later.

735
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,229
Look, why don't I just
stay here and work on this?

736
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,782
I don't think you're ready
to tackle all this fencing.

737
00:31:47,806 --> 00:31:49,375
Of course I am.

738
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,511
All right.
Knock yourself out.

739
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,013
Great.

740
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:55,847
So how much exactly
do you need me to do?

741
00:31:55,982 --> 00:31:59,085
Well, you see how the fence
carries on down the pasture?

742
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:00,319
Yep.

743
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:01,653
So what you want to do

744
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:02,864
is just keep following it along

745
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,056
and keep fixing it

746
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,470
until there isn't
any more fence.

747
00:32:06,993 --> 00:32:08,094
Okay, no problem.

748
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,074
Let me see...

749
00:33:00,246 --> 00:33:02,148
Seesaw...

750
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:09,455
How did he do the seesaw...

751
00:33:16,128 --> 00:33:17,696
Really?

752
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,098
There.

753
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:26,637
Good enough.

754
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,475
There's nothing out here,
anyway.

755
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,169
What?

756
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,683
I can at least catch
some rays out here.

757
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,021
You finished already?

758
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:17,188
Yep.

759
00:34:17,322 --> 00:34:18,322
All done.

760
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:20,359
That's great.

761
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:21,659
Yeah.

762
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,695
Did you need me
to do anything else, or...

763
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,030
Nah. Take a moment.

764
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:26,297
You deserve it.

765
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:29,768
Hey, I just got a call.

766
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,170
Some of the cattle

767
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,614
have wandered
over to Dawson Ranch.

768
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:33,715
Well, how'd they get out there?

769
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,906
I don't know.

770
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,242
Must be a gap in the fencing.

771
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,485
I did it
the way that you showed me,

772
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:38,710
but there was just so much,

773
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:40,124
and I couldn't finish the fence.

774
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:42,214
Wait. You did the fencing?

775
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,016
Come on.

776
00:34:46,152 --> 00:34:47,386
Let's go get those cattle.

777
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:48,630
Did you need me
to come help, or-

778
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:50,156
No.

779
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:01,700
Hey there, Mr. McCleary.

780
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,502
Do you need any help
with anything?

781
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:06,037
I think I'm doing all right.

782
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:08,774
We're just exercising
some horses.

783
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:10,075
Why don't you take a break?

784
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:12,378
Well, I already did that

785
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:14,480
when I should've kept
working on the fence.

786
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:17,183
I heard a few cattle
went wandering.

787
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:19,285
But don't worry.

788
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:21,487
Travis looked pretty upset.

789
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,490
He's just used to things
a certain way around here,

790
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,226
and change gets him
all bent out of shape.

791
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:29,761
I figured

792
00:35:29,895 --> 00:35:31,397
after his mom died

793
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,200
that staying close to home
is what he needed.

794
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:36,668
But all it's done

795
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,337
is made him too set in his ways

796
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,605
for his own good.

797
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,241
So I guess us being here

798
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:43,875
must really be throwing him off.

799
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:46,945
A little.

800
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:50,316
But don't you worry
about them cattle or Travis.

801
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:51,116
They'll be fine.

802
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,252
Thanks.

803
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:04,763
Well, it looks like

804
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:06,432
you got the cattle
all rounded up.

805
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:08,367
And we put a temporary fix
in that fence.

806
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,270
I shouldn't have
left you out there alone.

807
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,540
All right,

808
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,342
well, I guess
I'll see you all at dinner.

809
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,745
Guess she didn't want
to get her manicure

810
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:20,878
or whatever mucked up

811
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:21,946
doing the fence properly.

812
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,449
I mean, this isn't exactly

813
00:36:23,582 --> 00:36:25,262
the resort vacation
I'm sure she's used to.

814
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,797
Yeah, well, you and I
don't take vacations.

815
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,289
Maybe we should.

816
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:38,630
Olivia, you want
a custom-made Justin steak?

817
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:39,965
Sure.

818
00:36:40,098 --> 00:36:41,600
Comin' right up, y'all.

819
00:36:43,769 --> 00:36:45,103
Hey, I hardly saw you today.

820
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:47,439
I know.
I was grinding feed.

821
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:49,207
Prepare yourself,

822
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:52,644
because apparently ranchers have
a thing called Manure Monday.

823
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:54,346
Oh.

824
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,214
Speaking of which,

825
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:57,449
you know what today is?

826
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,150
- Yoga night?
- Yep.

827
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:03,188
Hey, we have fun
in the city, right?

828
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:06,525
Like movie night
and McCool's, of course.

829
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:09,328
Yeah.

830
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:11,763
I mean, it was.

831
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:12,897
What?

832
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:14,500
It seemed depressing.

833
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,768
And when I met Dylan,
I feel like I just...

834
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:19,338
I fell in love with him
because he was someone new,

835
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:23,008
someone who just lives
outside of all of that,

836
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:24,743
and it seemed...

837
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:25,876
kind of exciting.

838
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:29,581
Olivia, Amber,
your J-steaks are ready.

839
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:31,383
Coming.

840
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:35,086
Thing is, Liv...

841
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,790
we can't just talk about
all the things we hate forever.

842
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,892
Not without trying to change it.

843
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,843
- Hey.
- Hey.

844
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,146
Look, I just wanted to say

845
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,715
how sorry I am for not doing
the job properly.

846
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:05,984
I understand y'all
didn't grow up on a ranch.

847
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:09,721
Plus, this is supposed to be
kind of a vacation for you,

848
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:10,922
so...

849
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,591
I'll ease up.

850
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:14,764
I think maybe I needed
to change things up a little.

851
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:17,763
Then here, why don't you
heat that up?

852
00:38:18,897 --> 00:38:19,897
Okay.

853
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,803
Yeah, there you go.

854
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,872
And I'll try and make this trip

855
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:28,574
as enjoyable for you as I can.

856
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:32,411
I promise to be
a model temporary rancher.

857
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:33,745
- Deal?
- Deal.

858
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:41,820
Okay, well,

859
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,322
I guess I'll see you
tomorrow morning.

860
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:46,492
See you in the morning.

861
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:00,372
Hey, Dazzle-Doozy.

862
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,809
- She's so worried.
- I know.

863
00:39:03,942 --> 00:39:05,477
Morning.

864
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:06,945
Where's Olivia?

865
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,078
Still sleeping?

866
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:09,147
Oh, heck no.

867
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,416
She was up before any of us.

868
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,418
Something about finishing a job.

869
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:17,789
Hey...

870
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:18,923
Hey.

871
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,358
You know, if you miss breakfast,

872
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:21,827
there won't likely be any left.

873
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,471
I'll just eat later,
once the job's done.

874
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:24,930
You really
don't have to do this.

875
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,965
A true rancher wouldn't
leave a job half-done.

876
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,098
Am I right?

877
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:28,967
Mm-hmm.

878
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,436
Well, here.

879
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:32,137
It's no fun
working on an empty stomach.

880
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,605
Thanks.

881
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:35,974
Well then,

882
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,476
we'd better hustle

883
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:38,786
if we want to have some time
to go tubing.

884
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:39,545
Tubing?

885
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:40,979
Like down a silo, or...

886
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,814
You'll see.

887
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:44,382
Okay.

888
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:48,730
Did you pack the sunscreen?

889
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:49,955
Because this skin

890
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,890
is not conditioned
for high noon.

891
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,159
Where exactly are we tubing?

892
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:55,393
I don't know,

893
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:56,828
but hopefully not down a silo.

894
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:59,230
Hey, gang.
Ready to go cool off?

895
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:00,632
Ready as ever.

896
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:03,334
Oh, you may want
to put on a closed toe.

897
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:05,379
You've got a better chance
of handling a rattler

898
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,237
in a pair of boots.

899
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,371
Sorry, what?

900
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,007
Meet y'all at the truck.

901
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:14,079
Did he mean rattler as in snake?

902
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:15,814
I guess they come
with the territory.

903
00:40:19,718 --> 00:40:20,952
Here we are.

904
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:22,526
The river
that runs through our land.

905
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,899
So I suppose the water
must be pretty warm

906
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,357
on a day like today, huh?

907
00:40:26,492 --> 00:40:27,559
Actually, no.

908
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:29,194
It's glacial runoff, so...

909
00:40:29,327 --> 00:40:31,597
Oh, how refreshing.

910
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,632
This is bear territory,

911
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,445
so if we're lucky,
we'll spot a bear today.

912
00:40:35,567 --> 00:40:36,835
Or two.

913
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:39,204
These bears you speak of,

914
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:40,706
are they nocturnal?

915
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:42,479
Well, if you're talking
about black bears,

916
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:44,643
they're a little bit of both.

917
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,778
Meaning they like
the mornings and late evenings.

918
00:40:47,746 --> 00:40:49,280
I'm happy it's high noon now.

919
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:50,816
Now, grizzlies,

920
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,317
they're pretty much active

921
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,690
all hours of the day and night.

922
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,053
Foraging, fishing.

923
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,622
Don't worry.

924
00:40:56,755 --> 00:40:58,023
I doubt we'll come across any.

925
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:02,093
Now...

926
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:03,267
let the river do the work.

927
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:04,162
All you've got to do

928
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,295
is sit back,

929
00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:06,498
relax,

930
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:08,166
and enjoy the scenery.

931
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:10,602
Oh, it sounds just like
the lazy river at Club Med.

932
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:15,473
Oh!

933
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:16,708
What is it?
Is it a bear?

934
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,687
It's a leech. It's a leech.
I can't, I can't deal.

935
00:41:19,711 --> 00:41:20,955
Please don't tell me
you have to,

936
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,181
like, burn it off or something.

937
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,349
You could later.

938
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,151
As kindling for the fire.

939
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:27,753
Oh.

940
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:32,390
Sorry.

941
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:33,568
I didn't mean to freak out.

942
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:35,060
It's an honest mistake.

943
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:40,265
So does that mean
that there are leeches here?

944
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:42,233
It's not like a pool, so...

945
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:44,502
Yeah, you know what?

946
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:45,713
I don't think I'm overheating,

947
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:46,972
so maybe I'll just go back

948
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,545
to see if there's more feed
to grind.

949
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,109
Uh, I'm out, too.

950
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,477
Are you sure?

951
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:53,921
Because once you get
deep enough...

952
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:55,056
We'll see you back at the ranch!

953
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,160
Where the water's moving...

954
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:01,086
I guess it's just us then.

955
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:11,296
It is so cold.

956
00:42:55,841 --> 00:42:57,721
So how do you and your friends
know one another?

957
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,012
Well, Justin met Amber and I
at McCool's

958
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:02,223
during their open mic night.

959
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,581
What's that?

960
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:06,417
Oh, it's so much fun.

961
00:43:06,551 --> 00:43:07,853
Anyone can go up

962
00:43:07,986 --> 00:43:10,255
and, like, sing
or do a comedy number.

963
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:12,958
So the three of us
ended up onstage together,

964
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:17,028
and we just improv'd this,
like, silly rap.

965
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:18,773
And now it's kind of become
our theme song.

966
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:20,365
Theme song?

967
00:43:20,498 --> 00:43:21,733
Yeah.

968
00:43:21,867 --> 00:43:24,369
Like our own personal anthem,

969
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:26,638
or "yee-haw" kind of thing.

970
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:28,206
Okay.

971
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:29,875
I think I get it.

972
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:31,710
And what about you and Amber?

973
00:43:31,843 --> 00:43:33,244
It all started

974
00:43:33,378 --> 00:43:35,056
when our moms met
when we were in grade school.

975
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,849
It's like we became sisters.

976
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:40,451
So it must be hard on you, then.

977
00:43:40,585 --> 00:43:42,253
Her getting engaged
and moving on.

978
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:44,723
I mean, Amber's a city girl.

979
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:46,391
We both are.

980
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:47,859
We don't do all this.

981
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:52,397
Would you ever leave the ranch
to go live in the city?

982
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,965
Heck no.

983
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:55,939
I wouldn't set foot in one
if I didn't have to.

984
00:43:56,001 --> 00:43:58,203
That's because I've got
everything I want right here.

985
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,873
Maybe Amber doesn't
have that in the city.

986
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:04,109
I mean, do you?

987
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:06,277
Well, no,

988
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:09,247
but I'm not going
to just drop everything

989
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,716
and come live out here.

990
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,318
I get that.

991
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:15,586
For what it's worth,

992
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:17,222
you wear a pair of boots
real well.

993
00:44:20,058 --> 00:44:21,860
I guess we should
head back, huh?

994
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,161
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

995
00:44:25,731 --> 00:44:26,841
You good to paddle upstream?

996
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:27,865
Seriously?

997
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:29,267
Just kidding.

998
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,000
Come on. The ranch
is just over the hill.

999
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:39,295
That water today
was so refreshing.

1000
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:40,979
I feel so good.

1001
00:44:41,913 --> 00:44:43,648
Oh, look.

1002
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:45,259
They're so pretty.
They're everywhere.

1003
00:44:45,283 --> 00:44:46,384
Yep.

1004
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:47,753
This has always been

1005
00:44:47,886 --> 00:44:49,206
the best spot
to find wildflowers.

1006
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:53,300
You know, if you get those
in some water,

1007
00:44:53,324 --> 00:44:54,668
they'll likely last
the rest of your trip.

1008
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,661
I guess I should go do that.

1009
00:44:56,795 --> 00:44:58,463
If you can't find
anything to put them in,

1010
00:44:58,596 --> 00:45:00,031
in the guest house,

1011
00:45:00,165 --> 00:45:02,133
I'm sure we've got something
in the main house.

1012
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:03,401
Okay.

1013
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,637
Maybe I'll do that.

1014
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:09,007
- All right, then.
- Thanks again.

1015
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,140
Right.

1016
00:45:27,893 --> 00:45:29,527
How was the river ride?

1017
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,763
It was only Olivia and I.

1018
00:45:31,897 --> 00:45:34,399
The others got scared off.

1019
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:36,802
Well, we sure can't afford
a bad review.

1020
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:38,503
I know, Dad.

1021
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:39,636
I am trying.

1022
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,206
I know you are.

1023
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:42,841
And don't worry.

1024
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:45,343
We'll get those back taxes paid,

1025
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:46,845
and then we'll be able

1026
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:48,814
to go back to the way
things were around here.

1027
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,032
- Hey.
- Hey.

1028
00:46:07,165 --> 00:46:07,933
There's tea there,
if you want some.

1029
00:46:08,066 --> 00:46:09,367
Oh, thanks.

1030
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:11,736
So where's Amber?

1031
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:13,371
Giving Dylan
a Zoom tour of the ranch.

1032
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:15,540
Mm.

1033
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:18,443
You know, you actually
missed a lot of fun today.

1034
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:19,811
Really?

1035
00:46:19,945 --> 00:46:21,312
Well, it sounds like

1036
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,086
maybe it was better
that we weren't there.

1037
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,450
Well, maybe we did
prejudge him a little.

1038
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:27,853
Especially since

1039
00:46:27,986 --> 00:46:28,854
the only reason
they're doing all this

1040
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:29,987
is because they have to.

1041
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:31,088
To pay the bills.

1042
00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:32,824
Well, maybe he'll get

1043
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:34,318
something else
out of it, too, hmm?

1044
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:35,593
No.

1045
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:36,727
No way.

1046
00:46:36,862 --> 00:46:38,029
I am not pulling an Amber.

1047
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:40,398
Besides,
we are complete opposites.

1048
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:41,532
Are you?

1049
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:43,835
I'm just saying.

1050
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:45,303
Maybe not that different.

1051
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:02,087
Hello?

1052
00:47:03,188 --> 00:47:04,789
- Hey.
- Oh.

1053
00:47:04,923 --> 00:47:07,993
Don't you have a shower
in the big house?

1054
00:47:08,126 --> 00:47:09,861
Yeah, we do.

1055
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:12,297
But I prefer to shower outdoors.

1056
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:14,708
It's the best way
to start the day,

1057
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:16,301
if you ask me.

1058
00:47:20,906 --> 00:47:22,107
Yeah.

1059
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,284
I was just going
to get some coffee

1060
00:47:23,308 --> 00:47:24,509
because we ran out, so...

1061
00:47:24,642 --> 00:47:25,944
Oh, sure.

1062
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:27,778
Yeah, I'll bring some over
in a moment.

1063
00:47:27,913 --> 00:47:29,247
Okay.

1064
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,425
All right.

1065
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:42,303
Seeing as the cattle drive's
a few days away,

1066
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:44,362
I think it's important
y'all learn some basics.

1067
00:47:44,495 --> 00:47:46,797
First, it's important to note

1068
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:48,433
that everything we do
with our cows

1069
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:49,566
comes down to driving.

1070
00:47:49,634 --> 00:47:51,136
Now, a lot of ranchers,

1071
00:47:51,269 --> 00:47:53,671
they aren't too concerned
about how to approach a cow.

1072
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:55,173
But I was always taught

1073
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:56,650
that the first point
of contact's critical.

1074
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:58,143
Like a first impression.

1075
00:47:58,276 --> 00:47:59,510
Exactly.

1076
00:47:59,644 --> 00:48:01,212
I mean, how would you feel

1077
00:48:01,346 --> 00:48:03,681
if someone came at you
with their arms waving?

1078
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:05,550
I'd feel like a cab driver.

1079
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:07,852
So what you want to do

1080
00:48:07,986 --> 00:48:09,921
is approach the cow at an angle,

1081
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,722
as if you're just going
to go on by,

1082
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:13,091
so the cow remains calm.

1083
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:16,003
Then, we'll put ourselves
in their pressure zone

1084
00:48:16,027 --> 00:48:17,528
to move them along.

1085
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:20,065
So let's give it a try.

1086
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:22,133
Okay.

1087
00:48:23,534 --> 00:48:24,802
All right, Amber.
You're up.

1088
00:48:24,936 --> 00:48:26,504
All right.
Come on, girl.

1089
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:27,637
Whoo!

1090
00:48:29,975 --> 00:48:31,142
Whoa!

1091
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:36,081
Guys! Check this out!

1092
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:37,574
All right, that's it. Yep.

1093
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:39,517
Push 'em from the hip.

1094
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,718
Whoa. Whoa.

1095
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,320
Sorry.

1096
00:48:42,453 --> 00:48:44,255
I got it!

1097
00:48:52,397 --> 00:48:54,099
It's your turn, Justin.
Get out there.

1098
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:55,900
Okay.

1099
00:48:56,034 --> 00:48:57,068
Okay, come on, Daisy.

1100
00:48:57,202 --> 00:48:58,069
Here we go!

1101
00:48:58,203 --> 00:48:59,737
Yeah! Whoo!

1102
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,272
So like with Amber,

1103
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:02,483
you've got to push 'em
from the shoulder.

1104
00:49:02,507 --> 00:49:03,241
Yeah. Okay.

1105
00:49:03,374 --> 00:49:04,775
Turn 'em with the head.

1106
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:06,653
Okay, we want to get him
in through that corral.

1107
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:07,945
Yeah.

1108
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:11,116
This is hard.

1109
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:13,551
Come on!

1110
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:14,685
I got it!

1111
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:18,456
Okay, Olivia.
Pull back on the reins.

1112
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:20,025
Okay.

1113
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:23,394
That's it.

1114
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:25,688
Hey, come back here.
Where are you guys going?

1115
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,368
Am I doing it?

1116
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:43,147
Nice.

1117
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:52,090
Look at that.

1118
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:53,558
I did it.

1119
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:54,925
No stress here, baby.

1120
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,661
I think that's enough
for one day.

1121
00:49:56,794 --> 00:49:58,339
Don't want you dancing
bowlegged all night.

1122
00:49:58,363 --> 00:49:59,597
Did you say dancing?

1123
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,632
Yep. Saturday nights,

1124
00:50:01,766 --> 00:50:02,976
we all get together
at the Black Hoof

1125
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,768
and kick up our boots.

1126
00:50:03,901 --> 00:50:04,769
What do you know?

1127
00:50:04,902 --> 00:50:06,137
Almost like home.

1128
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,406
But first,

1129
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,284
we need some fish
for tomorrow night's fish fry.

1130
00:50:10,308 --> 00:50:11,588
So who's up
for a little fishing?

1131
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,144
I'm in.

1132
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:15,580
Actually, I think Amber and I

1133
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:17,182
will just stick around

1134
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:18,725
and work on our driving
just a little bit more.

1135
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,085
But you two go.

1136
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:21,986
I mean, Olivia is
like a pro at this, so...

1137
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:24,755
Um, okay,

1138
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:26,791
but I haven't really done
any fishing, so...

1139
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:28,726
Ah, don't worry about it.

1140
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:30,539
It'll be the easiest
thing you do all week.

1141
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,173
So what kind of things
do you like to paint?

1142
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:44,209
Whatever inspires me, I guess.

1143
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:47,778
But to be honest,

1144
00:50:47,912 --> 00:50:49,656
I haven't been inspired
to touch a paintbrush

1145
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,150
in forever.

1146
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:53,551
Does that mean

1147
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:54,828
you're just going to keep doing

1148
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:55,852
this job you hate?

1149
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,088
Except now you won't have

1150
00:50:57,222 --> 00:50:58,089
your best friend
to commiserate with.

1151
00:50:58,223 --> 00:50:59,524
Hey, you could stand

1152
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:01,159
to try something new yourself.

1153
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:03,228
I mean, at least I'm here,

1154
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:04,829
completely out of
my comfort zone.

1155
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:06,273
Because you want
to convince your friend

1156
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:07,832
of her mistake.

1157
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:09,234
So?

1158
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:11,236
At least I'm giving it my all.

1159
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:13,871
I mean, look at you.

1160
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:15,873
You said you never
even set foot in New York.

1161
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,842
You got that right.

1162
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:19,310
It's a good thing.

1163
00:51:19,444 --> 00:51:20,787
Because you wouldn't have
a clue what to do

1164
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:21,979
when you got there.

1165
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:23,381
Yeah, I don't know about that.

1166
00:51:23,514 --> 00:51:26,884
Okay, so you're saying

1167
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:28,362
you'd know how to get a cab
during rush hour

1168
00:51:28,386 --> 00:51:30,020
without getting it poached?

1169
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,358
Or how to not get crushed
by the subway doors?

1170
00:51:33,491 --> 00:51:36,361
Or how about
which food vendors to eat at

1171
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:37,494
and which to avoid?

1172
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,097
Well, no,

1173
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:41,231
but how hard could it be?

1174
00:51:41,332 --> 00:51:42,600
Uh-uh.
Don't even.

1175
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:43,968
Because trust me,

1176
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,136
it is as hard

1177
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,671
as me trying to lasso a bull.

1178
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:49,974
Or get this dang thing
untangled.

1179
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,209
Just give it a gentle tug.

1180
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:52,502
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1181
00:51:53,244 --> 00:51:54,412
Oh!

1182
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:03,754
So how's the event plan?

1183
00:52:03,888 --> 00:52:05,122
All right.

1184
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:06,467
That Olivia's
a bit of a handful.

1185
00:52:06,491 --> 00:52:08,359
Oh, here's the crew now.

1186
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,297
Uh, guys, I think

1187
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,064
we might be a tad overdressed.

1188
00:52:14,199 --> 00:52:15,600
There's no such thing.

1189
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:17,502
This place could totally pass
for McCool's.

1190
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:20,705
Guys, they even have a mic
for karaoke.

1191
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:22,673
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

1192
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:23,808
Yee-haw.

1193
00:52:26,211 --> 00:52:27,545
What are they doing?

1194
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:34,424
My name's Olivia,

1195
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:35,553
it's Liv for short,

1196
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:38,789
and I'm an artist at heart.

1197
00:52:38,923 --> 00:52:40,057
I'm hanging with my girl,

1198
00:52:40,191 --> 00:52:41,559
she's Amber, my best friend,

1199
00:52:41,692 --> 00:52:43,394
who gets me
and makes it all better, yeah.

1200
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:45,095
That's right, I'm Amber,

1201
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:46,597
that's what we do,

1202
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:47,731
raise a glass

1203
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:49,200
and talk about things so true.

1204
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:54,239
'Cause we fit like a glove.

1205
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:55,506
Justin here,

1206
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,107
and I love these two,

1207
00:52:57,242 --> 00:52:58,443
so I'm going to get in on it

1208
00:52:58,576 --> 00:53:00,278
and tell it all to you.

1209
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:02,847
And okay, that's cool,
the cow goes moo,

1210
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:06,116
but I miss Manhattan
and the taxis, too.

1211
00:53:06,251 --> 00:53:07,585
City life is the best

1212
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:09,186
and there's nothing better

1213
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,122
than us three
getting a latte together.

1214
00:53:12,257 --> 00:53:14,625
Ooh!

1215
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,901
Hey, y'all, my name's Travis.

1216
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,803
And I'm a rancher.

1217
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:30,417
I lead
my cattle out to the pasture.

1218
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:32,243
Been ranchin' my whole life.

1219
00:53:32,377 --> 00:53:33,744
It just feels right.

1220
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:35,813
And if you know me,
you know that's no...

1221
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,014
Bull.

1222
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:39,350
Yeah.

1223
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:44,389
Give it up for the city folks.

1224
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,462
Well, thank you

1225
00:54:57,595 --> 00:54:59,564
for not leaving us
out to dry up there.

1226
00:54:59,697 --> 00:55:01,866
Yeah, we look out
for one another around here.

1227
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,860
I kind of like that little
two-step you taught us.

1228
00:55:07,572 --> 00:55:09,273
You know, we...

1229
00:55:09,407 --> 00:55:11,075
take it a bit easier on Sundays,

1230
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:13,243
so if you want,

1231
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:16,080
I can give you another tour,

1232
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:17,891
seeing as my first one
may have been lacking.

1233
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:20,317
You mean
the point-and-look tour?

1234
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:21,595
"Oh, and over there
behind the barn

1235
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:23,087
is the hen coop.

1236
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,622
House is over there.

1237
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:26,791
Land is over there."

1238
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,093
Okay, I get it.

1239
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:30,761
So what do you say?

1240
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:32,162
Redo?

1241
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:34,176
I mean, I wouldn't want you
giving a bad review.

1242
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:35,633
I would love a redo.

1243
00:55:36,534 --> 00:55:37,902
Thank you.

1244
00:55:38,035 --> 00:55:39,870
Hey. I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

1245
00:55:40,004 --> 00:55:41,038
No, no.

1246
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,774
We were just decompressing,
you know,

1247
00:55:43,908 --> 00:55:46,577
from driving cattle
and fishing today.

1248
00:55:47,445 --> 00:55:48,713
Wow.

1249
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:50,246
Too bad
you're only here for a week.

1250
00:55:50,314 --> 00:55:51,782
That's right.

1251
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:54,452
Blowing in and out of here
like a tumbleweed.

1252
00:56:00,425 --> 00:56:02,460
- Well, see you tomorrow.
- Sure will.

1253
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:23,814
Ugh!

1254
00:56:23,948 --> 00:56:25,950
Shh!

1255
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:33,858
Morning.

1256
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:35,159
Hey.

1257
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:37,094
How's the crew doing?

1258
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,907
I think a bit too much
giddy-up last night.

1259
00:56:40,598 --> 00:56:41,598
How about you?

1260
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:44,101
Slept like a log.

1261
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,003
Actually, I've slept like
a log every night

1262
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:47,136
since I've been here.

1263
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:48,171
It's the country air.

1264
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:49,474
It's like medicine.

1265
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:51,167
So are you ready
for a little adventure?

1266
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,577
You bet.

1267
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:56,213
Then hop in.

1268
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:57,815
Okay.

1269
00:57:49,634 --> 00:57:51,035
Wow.

1270
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:54,639
This is the most stunning
view I have ever seen.

1271
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,975
If you look to that point
way over there

1272
00:57:58,108 --> 00:58:00,545
and follow it all the way across
to that ridge?

1273
00:58:01,879 --> 00:58:03,399
What you're looking at
is all our land.

1274
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:06,216
This really does make
the city seem pretty small.

1275
00:58:08,853 --> 00:58:11,956
I got you something.

1276
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:15,435
It's not professional quality,

1277
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:17,628
but it's all I had.

1278
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:20,264
This is really so thoughtful.

1279
00:58:20,397 --> 00:58:22,132
I just...

1280
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:24,168
I haven't painted anything
in so long.

1281
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:27,371
Well, you said you'd paint
what inspired you,

1282
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,640
and I don't know,

1283
00:58:29,774 --> 00:58:31,108
but to me,

1284
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:33,010
it doesn't get more inspiring
than this.

1285
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:34,143
I mean, my dad,

1286
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:36,947
he goes to church every Sunday.

1287
00:58:37,081 --> 00:58:39,617
But here,

1288
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:40,950
this is where I've been coming

1289
00:58:40,985 --> 00:58:42,186
ever since my mom passed.

1290
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:48,125
Somehow, the sun, breeze...

1291
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:50,127
it all just makes me
feel closer to her.

1292
00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:53,631
I think you're right.

1293
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:55,532
Maybe it is time
I had another go.

1294
00:58:56,801 --> 00:58:58,202
But no peeking.

1295
00:58:58,335 --> 00:58:59,637
Don't worry.

1296
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:01,538
I've got some chapters
to catch up on.

1297
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,675
I promise to keep myself busy.

1298
00:59:46,383 --> 00:59:47,718
All right.

1299
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:50,655
You ready?

1300
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:03,200
I'm sure it looks amateur.

1301
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:04,333
No.

1302
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,636
No, it's incredible.

1303
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,013
You're not just saying that,
are you?

1304
01:00:07,037 --> 01:00:08,072
There are some things

1305
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:12,041
This...

1306
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:13,177
is definitely one of them.

1307
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:15,445
Now come on.

1308
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:16,413
You want to try your hand
at a little off-roading?

1309
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:17,414
For real?

1310
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:18,916
Well, the only thing

1311
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:20,060
you've got to be
on the lookout for around here

1312
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:21,084
are animal crossings.

1313
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:22,118
Huh.

1314
01:00:22,186 --> 01:00:23,186
Piece of cake.

1315
01:00:24,188 --> 01:00:25,189
Yee-haw!

1316
01:00:26,924 --> 01:00:28,258
This is so much fun.

1317
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:40,905
Oh, no!

1318
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,749
Is it a flat?

1319
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:53,426
I just... I didn't want
to hit that turtle.

1320
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:54,685
I think I hit a big rock.

1321
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,760
Yeah, looks like
a busted drive shaft.

1322
01:00:58,756 --> 01:00:59,990
Meaning?

1323
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:04,061
Meaning we're walking back.

1324
01:01:07,965 --> 01:01:09,366
Sorry about your truck.

1325
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:10,701
Don't worry about it.

1326
01:01:10,835 --> 01:01:12,937
I'll get it towed
back to the ranch.

1327
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,775
If it's the wildlife
you're worried about,

1328
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:19,343
don't be.

1329
01:01:19,476 --> 01:01:21,779
I mean, for the most part,

1330
01:01:21,912 --> 01:01:23,914
they don't want
anything to do with us.

1331
01:01:24,048 --> 01:01:25,950
And the other part?

1332
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:29,619
Here's what you need to know
about the animals around here.

1333
01:01:29,754 --> 01:01:32,122
For starters,
this is their territory,

1334
01:01:32,256 --> 01:01:33,824
so we need to respect that.

1335
01:01:34,658 --> 01:01:35,659
Like the rooster.

1336
01:01:35,793 --> 01:01:37,127
Exactly.

1337
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:38,604
Nothing's going
to come pecking at you

1338
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:39,930
if it doesn't feel threatened.

1339
01:01:42,666 --> 01:01:45,135
And what about that?

1340
01:01:45,269 --> 01:01:47,471
The wolves?

1341
01:01:47,604 --> 01:01:50,374
We normally don't have
to worry about them.

1342
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:52,376
Well...

1343
01:01:52,509 --> 01:01:54,478
well, when would you worry?

1344
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:57,047
Well, when you're talking
about a lone wolf.

1345
01:01:57,181 --> 01:01:58,783
They can be more aggressive

1346
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:00,796
because they don't have
the support of the pack.

1347
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:03,087
Like that day
we went on a trail ride.

1348
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,931
Normally, I would've left
those cows out to pasture,

1349
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:07,291
but we both saw something.

1350
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:09,927
Figured it'd be best
to drive 'em back.

1351
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:13,397
I had no idea.

1352
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,299
And here I was
trying to prove my point.

1353
01:02:16,934 --> 01:02:18,435
You're right.

1354
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:21,238
I am bothered by how Amber
seems to be catching on

1355
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:24,842
and not freaking out
like I thought she would.

1356
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,112
Because then she'd stay.

1357
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,514
Hmm.

1358
01:02:30,647 --> 01:02:32,182
I get it's hard

1359
01:02:32,316 --> 01:02:34,852
not having that person
you confide your thoughts to.

1360
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:36,887
I mean, for me, it was my mom.

1361
01:02:37,822 --> 01:02:38,688
We'd sit by the fire

1362
01:02:38,823 --> 01:02:40,124
and talk about

1363
01:02:40,257 --> 01:02:41,777
all the adventures
we'd go on together.

1364
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:43,499
It sounds like
you were really close.

1365
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:45,896
We were.

1366
01:02:46,831 --> 01:02:48,265
She was so full of life.

1367
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:51,936
I mean, she would have loved
this whole dude ranch thing.

1368
01:02:53,871 --> 01:02:55,039
After she was gone,

1369
01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:57,007
I just threw myself into work.

1370
01:02:58,175 --> 01:03:01,345
Didn't think about
any of those adventures anymore.

1371
01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:02,947
Just stayed the course.

1372
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,381
Day in, day out.

1373
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:07,550
Amber and I,

1374
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:09,086
we always talk about

1375
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:11,288
all the things
we're going to do.

1376
01:03:12,589 --> 01:03:14,258
Now she is doing something.

1377
01:03:15,392 --> 01:03:18,562
And me...

1378
01:03:18,695 --> 01:03:20,164
well, I'm not.

1379
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:23,333
You can think about
that painting you did today.

1380
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:25,502
Who knows?

1381
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,235
Maybe that'll inspire
more good thoughts.

1382
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,673
Maybe those memories of your mom

1383
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,808
will get you thinking
about those adventures again.

1384
01:03:32,910 --> 01:03:34,311
Maybe.

1385
01:03:35,712 --> 01:03:37,614
Well, thank you.

1386
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,116
For everything today.

1387
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:43,420
Well, don't go writing
about it in your review.

1388
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:45,055
Or else everybody

1389
01:03:45,189 --> 01:03:47,149
will think they'll get
the same special treatment.

1390
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:00,269
Morning.

1391
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:01,405
Coffee?

1392
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:03,874
Maybe a double espresso
would be good.

1393
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:05,509
I'm beginning to think

1394
01:04:05,642 --> 01:04:07,587
this coffee tastes
a little better than my lattes.

1395
01:04:07,611 --> 01:04:08,922
It really gives you
that giddy-up and go.

1396
01:04:08,946 --> 01:04:10,280
I could use it.

1397
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:12,568
Are you having
a 48-hour recovery?

1398
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:14,151
No.

1399
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:16,453
I spent my entire Sunday
practicing my cattle driving,

1400
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:18,322
and it was a lot of hours
on horseback.

1401
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:21,091
Well, you'd better
get used to it.

1402
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,295
All right. I am off
to do my morning chores.

1403
01:04:25,429 --> 01:04:26,596
Oh-

1404
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:33,303
Morning, rooster.

1405
01:04:33,437 --> 01:04:34,538
Don't mind me.

1406
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:36,351
I'm just going to help out
the ladies here.

1407
01:04:39,743 --> 01:04:41,221
Throw that on bread
with a little ham,

1408
01:04:41,245 --> 01:04:42,947
got the perfect western.

1409
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,915
Who's next?

1410
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:46,550
All right.
There you are.

1411
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:47,551
Enjoy.

1412
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:49,186
Step right up, sir.

1413
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:03,733
Hey.

1414
01:05:03,867 --> 01:05:05,135
Do you want to take a ride?

1415
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:06,370
I'm headed into town.

1416
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:08,172
Nah.

1417
01:05:08,305 --> 01:05:10,385
I think I'll stay here
and keep an eye on the guests.

1418
01:05:13,543 --> 01:05:15,045
Well, I can't say I blame you.

1419
01:05:15,179 --> 01:05:16,947
I never would've believed it,

1420
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:18,215
but...

1421
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:20,184
they're doing all right.

1422
01:05:20,317 --> 01:05:22,519
Especially Olivia.

1423
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,521
She's really
throwing herself into it.

1424
01:05:26,156 --> 01:05:27,524
Well, I'm sure

1425
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:28,969
it's going to make a great story
for her Instagram

1426
01:05:28,993 --> 01:05:30,694
when she gets back to New York.

1427
01:05:30,827 --> 01:05:33,030
I mean, we both know
she's still a city girl.

1428
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:36,033
- Right?
- Of course.

1429
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:57,887
- Hey.
- Hey.

1430
01:05:58,022 --> 01:05:59,456
I finished all my chores,

1431
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:00,590
so I was thinking

1432
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:02,726
I'd like to take
some of those paints

1433
01:06:02,859 --> 01:06:05,595
and head out on my own
into the pasture.

1434
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:06,939
Hopefully get
some more inspiration.

1435
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,999
Sounds like a great idea.

1436
01:06:09,133 --> 01:06:11,668
But hey, don't wander
off too far, now.

1437
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:12,969
I won't.

1438
01:06:27,717 --> 01:06:28,985
Toro? What is it?

1439
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,168
Okay.

1440
01:06:45,135 --> 01:06:46,170
It's okay, Olivia.

1441
01:06:46,303 --> 01:06:48,038
Don't freak out.

1442
01:06:48,172 --> 01:06:49,473
You are not a threat.

1443
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:16,966
It just stood there,
staring at me.

1444
01:07:17,101 --> 01:07:18,802
And then it started
to come closer.

1445
01:07:18,935 --> 01:07:20,570
You sure it was alone?

1446
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:22,106
As far as I could tell.

1447
01:07:23,107 --> 01:07:23,873
Do you think it was
that lone wolf?

1448
01:07:24,007 --> 01:07:26,042
Could have been.

1449
01:07:26,176 --> 01:07:27,411
Either way, I think it's best

1450
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:29,313
if we round up
as many cattle as we can

1451
01:07:29,446 --> 01:07:31,481
and bring 'em back
to the corral.

1452
01:07:31,615 --> 01:07:32,649
All right.

1453
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:33,883
I'll go saddle up.

1454
01:07:34,017 --> 01:07:35,119
Olivia, wait.

1455
01:07:35,252 --> 01:07:37,287
What?

1456
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:39,623
I'll meet you by the barn.

1457
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:50,633
Whoa.

1458
01:07:52,469 --> 01:07:53,469
Right over there.

1459
01:07:53,503 --> 01:07:55,139
That's where I saw it.

1460
01:07:56,306 --> 01:07:57,706
Yeah, I think
he should've gone back

1461
01:07:57,741 --> 01:07:58,741
to his pack by now.

1462
01:08:03,547 --> 01:08:04,948
What?

1463
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,481
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were a country girl.

1464
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:16,660
Whoa.

1465
01:08:19,228 --> 01:08:20,397
Olivia.

1466
01:08:21,997 --> 01:08:23,166
You all right?

1467
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,269
Yeah. All good.

1468
01:08:26,469 --> 01:08:28,572
Here. Back 'em up.

1469
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:29,973
Back off.

1470
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,774
Back off nice and slow.

1471
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:41,684
Y'all all right?

1472
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:43,687
Yeah.

1473
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:45,555
Yeah, I think you scared it off.

1474
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:47,056
Good.

1475
01:08:47,191 --> 01:08:49,271
Let's hope it goes back
to its pack where it belongs.

1476
01:08:51,428 --> 01:08:52,629
Well, I'd say

1477
01:08:52,762 --> 01:08:55,064
that's enough excitement
for one day.

1478
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:56,719
How about we get
that cattle corralled?

1479
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:10,580
Okay, like this?

1480
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:13,082
That was pretty good.

1481
01:09:13,217 --> 01:09:14,783
Not bad, not bad.

1482
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,653
- Hey.
- Hey.

1483
01:09:16,786 --> 01:09:19,223
I heard we missed
an exciting day.

1484
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:23,727
Yeah, but Annie-Got-Her-Gun
over there came to the rescue.

1485
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,862
I get that we're from the city,

1486
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,307
but she doesn't have to make it
so obvious

1487
01:09:27,331 --> 01:09:28,665
that she thinks I don't belong.

1488
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:30,666
I mean, I can do
a lot of stuff around here.

1489
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,335
Of course you can.

1490
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:33,836
You know what?

1491
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:36,406
You are going
to show her what's up.

1492
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:39,776
- I am?
- Yes.

1493
01:09:39,908 --> 01:09:41,444
Yes, you are.

1494
01:09:42,312 --> 01:09:44,314
Come on.

1495
01:09:44,448 --> 01:09:45,648
Hey, all.

1496
01:09:45,782 --> 01:09:47,183
Who's up for
a best set of three?

1497
01:09:47,317 --> 01:09:48,952
I'm in.

1498
01:09:49,085 --> 01:09:50,085
Okay, great.

1499
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:52,289
Well, you and Olivia are up.

1500
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:56,693
Go show her what's up, okay?

1501
01:10:01,398 --> 01:10:02,599
Here we go.

1502
01:10:05,934 --> 01:10:08,204
Okay. Not bad.

1503
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:14,978
Yes!

1504
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:16,646
Hey.

1505
01:10:17,647 --> 01:10:19,316
- Here we go.
- That's beginner's luck.

1506
01:10:19,449 --> 01:10:20,650
We'll see.

1507
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:22,785
Whoo, Kat.

1508
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:28,358
Okay.

1509
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:33,463
All right.
Here we go, here we go.

1510
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:35,665
Yes!

1511
01:10:39,469 --> 01:10:40,804
Tiebreaker.

1512
01:10:45,709 --> 01:10:46,710
Oh!

1513
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:48,512
Good try.
That was great.

1514
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:50,480
Bound to happen eventually, Kat.

1515
01:10:53,483 --> 01:10:54,851
You've got to miss sometime.

1516
01:10:57,085 --> 01:10:58,388
Eye on the prize.

1517
01:11:02,025 --> 01:11:03,660
Olivia! Oh, my gosh.

1518
01:11:08,498 --> 01:11:09,499
Oh, my gosh.

1519
01:11:09,633 --> 01:11:11,868
Amber, that was amazing.

1520
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:14,438
I mean, she can't say that
we don't belong now, right?

1521
01:11:14,571 --> 01:11:16,205
We can so do this.

1522
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,942
Yeah. I mean,
you definitely can.

1523
01:11:19,075 --> 01:11:21,445
Me, I am not so sure.

1524
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:23,713
Hey.

1525
01:11:23,847 --> 01:11:25,514
Come on.
Sure you can.

1526
01:11:26,883 --> 01:11:28,785
I don't know.

1527
01:11:28,918 --> 01:11:30,158
Maybe I am making a big mistake

1528
01:11:30,186 --> 01:11:32,389
by marrying a rancher.

1529
01:11:32,522 --> 01:11:33,602
What are you talking about?

1530
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:35,725
Come on,
you're crushing it here.

1531
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:37,794
No, I'm not.

1532
01:11:37,927 --> 01:11:39,329
I mean, it only looks that way

1533
01:11:39,463 --> 01:11:40,743
because I was trying to show you

1534
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:42,150
that I'm not making
a big mistake.

1535
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:45,134
I don't know what I'm doing.

1536
01:11:45,268 --> 01:11:46,503
I mean, I don't know

1537
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,505
how to manage a ranch
or drive cattle.

1538
01:11:48,638 --> 01:11:50,639
I do know you.

1539
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:53,410
Because you're like
a sister to me.

1540
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:55,344
Which is why
I don't want you to leave,

1541
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:56,480
but...

1542
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:58,448
it's time we made a change.

1543
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:01,918
So what you're doing...

1544
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:03,050
is not a mistake.

1545
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:05,522
And you and I and Justin

1546
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:07,557
are going to crush
this cattle drive.

1547
01:12:07,691 --> 01:12:08,992
The city slickers

1548
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:13,329
All right.

1549
01:12:13,463 --> 01:12:15,832
We are going to show them
how it's done.

1550
01:12:15,965 --> 01:12:16,633
We're doing it.

1551
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:17,967
Oh, we are doing it.

1552
01:12:27,777 --> 01:12:30,614
You really think
they're ready for this?

1553
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:32,115
Ready as they'll ever be.

1554
01:12:32,248 --> 01:12:33,517
Well, I'm here if you need me.

1555
01:12:33,650 --> 01:12:34,918
Appreciate that.

1556
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:36,219
Well, here they come.

1557
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:54,270
I hear there's some cattle

1558
01:12:54,404 --> 01:12:55,648
that need
driving out to pasture.

1559
01:12:55,672 --> 01:12:57,206
You got that right.

1560
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,340
Y'all ready?

1561
01:12:58,442 --> 01:13:00,243
Oh, we're more than ready.

1562
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:01,511
Let's giddy-up and do this.

1563
01:13:58,568 --> 01:13:59,835
Well, gang, you did it.

1564
01:14:01,004 --> 01:14:02,606
Yes!

1565
01:14:03,371 --> 01:14:04,608
Oh, um, do you think

1566
01:14:04,741 --> 01:14:06,218
you could take
some more photos for us?

1567
01:14:06,242 --> 01:14:07,511
Oh, why not.

1568
01:14:11,314 --> 01:14:12,692
So this is where
the cattle will graze

1569
01:14:12,716 --> 01:14:14,150
for the rest of the season?

1570
01:14:14,282 --> 01:14:16,385
That's right.

1571
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,563
Then before the weather turns,

1572
01:14:17,587 --> 01:14:18,888
we'll round 'em back up

1573
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:21,124
and bring 'em back
into the winter pasture.

1574
01:14:21,257 --> 01:14:22,592
Hmm.

1575
01:14:22,726 --> 01:14:23,860
Who's "we"?

1576
01:14:25,061 --> 01:14:26,061
You mean Kat?

1577
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:27,094
Most likely.

1578
01:14:29,599 --> 01:14:31,400
You know, I get
why you came out here.

1579
01:14:31,535 --> 01:14:33,803
The whole bachelorette getaway,

1580
01:14:33,937 --> 01:14:37,139
showing Amber her mistake.

1581
01:14:37,273 --> 01:14:40,043
But whatever your reasons were,

1582
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:41,811
you showed a real
go-get-'em spirit.

1583
01:14:41,945 --> 01:14:43,046
Thanks.

1584
01:14:43,179 --> 01:14:44,880
But I'm glad you took
a chance on us.

1585
01:14:46,449 --> 01:14:47,951
Well...

1586
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:49,753
changing things up around here

1587
01:14:49,886 --> 01:14:51,726
may not have turned out
to be such a bad thing.

1588
01:14:52,556 --> 01:14:55,124
No. It's not.

1589
01:14:55,258 --> 01:14:59,128
And I think it might be time
that I made a few changes.

1590
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:03,933
So these changes...

1591
01:15:04,067 --> 01:15:05,602
Any idea what they look like?

1592
01:15:05,735 --> 01:15:07,003
I won't know

1593
01:15:07,136 --> 01:15:08,838
until I set
my brush to the canvas.

1594
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,216
We'd better head back
before we miss lunch.

1595
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:12,240
Yeah.

1596
01:15:24,888 --> 01:15:25,922
Where's Justin?

1597
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:27,791
He is saying goodbye to Daisy.

1598
01:15:27,924 --> 01:15:29,404
I swear, he's going
to miss that horse

1599
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:30,994
something fierce.

1600
01:15:31,127 --> 01:15:33,129
What about you?

1601
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:34,262
Oh, yeah.

1602
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:36,165
Toro was a great horse.

1603
01:15:36,299 --> 01:15:37,567
He never steered me wrong.

1604
01:15:37,701 --> 01:15:41,103
Yeah, I'm talking about Travis.

1605
01:15:43,306 --> 01:15:44,641
- That's crazy.
- Is it?

1606
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:47,210
Because I see how you two
get all moon-eyed

1607
01:15:47,343 --> 01:15:48,419
when you look at each other.

1608
01:15:48,443 --> 01:15:49,946
He gets like that?

1609
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:51,781
Uh-huh.
And so do you.

1610
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:55,018
So, what are you
going to do about it?

1611
01:15:56,318 --> 01:15:58,321
What do you mean?
There's nothing to do.

1612
01:15:58,454 --> 01:16:00,023
We leave tomorrow, right?

1613
01:16:00,156 --> 01:16:01,523
So?

1614
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:02,525
You could tell him
to come visit you.

1615
01:16:02,659 --> 01:16:04,127
No.

1616
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,537
There is no way that man
is setting foot in the city.

1617
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:07,096
Just promise me

1618
01:16:07,230 --> 01:16:09,270
that you will tell him
how you feel before we leave?

1619
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:10,298
Oh, no, no.

1620
01:16:10,333 --> 01:16:11,735
I can't do that.

1621
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:15,504
Yeah, um...

1622
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:16,639
of course you can.

1623
01:16:16,673 --> 01:16:17,673
Because if you don't,

1624
01:16:17,707 --> 01:16:19,041
it's just going to become

1625
01:16:19,175 --> 01:16:20,252
one of those things
you complain about.

1626
01:16:20,276 --> 01:16:21,477
But this time,

1627
01:16:21,611 --> 01:16:23,022
I won't be there
to commiserate with you.

1628
01:16:23,046 --> 01:16:24,046
So...

1629
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:26,582
go on.

1630
01:16:26,716 --> 01:16:27,951
Now?

1631
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:29,719
Yeah. Now.

1632
01:16:30,386 --> 01:16:31,921
Okay. Okay.

1633
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:53,109
What?

1634
01:16:53,242 --> 01:16:55,111
You don't think I have the guts?

1635
01:16:56,279 --> 01:16:57,380
Fine.

1636
01:16:57,513 --> 01:16:59,014
I'll show you.

1637
01:17:04,452 --> 01:17:06,089
See?

1638
01:17:06,222 --> 01:17:07,857
I can do it.

1639
01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:18,234
So the day was a success.

1640
01:17:18,367 --> 01:17:19,468
Yeah, sure was.

1641
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:21,737
You know,
I've really got to admit

1642
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:24,473
it was super-weird
having other people here.

1643
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,608
You know, outsiders,

1644
01:17:25,742 --> 01:17:27,410
they really don't get all this.

1645
01:17:27,543 --> 01:17:29,045
I was worried, too,

1646
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:31,547
but I would say

1647
01:17:31,681 --> 01:17:33,782
it worked out even better
than I could have hoped.

1648
01:17:33,916 --> 01:17:36,252
Well, I'm a little bit worried.

1649
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,521
About us.

1650
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:42,191
You know, it's always been
just me and you out here,

1651
01:17:42,325 --> 01:17:43,359
and after this week,

1652
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,894
I realized

1653
01:17:45,028 --> 01:17:48,164
that it might not always be
that way, so...

1654
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:49,457
Look, I just want to tell you

1655
01:17:49,532 --> 01:17:50,366
that I care about you.

1656
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,101
A lot.

1657
01:17:52,235 --> 01:17:55,603
And I've pictured a future
with you and I together,

1658
01:17:55,739 --> 01:17:56,505
and I know we have what it takes

1659
01:17:56,639 --> 01:17:57,773
to make it work.

1660
01:17:59,642 --> 01:18:03,179
I mean, we're not out here
for a week playing ranchers.

1661
01:18:03,312 --> 01:18:04,612
We are ranchers.

1662
01:18:08,251 --> 01:18:11,120
Sorry. I was just saying
goodbye to Cyclone, so...

1663
01:18:13,156 --> 01:18:14,323
Yeah.

1664
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:18,693
You know, I'm just going to go.

1665
01:18:18,827 --> 01:18:19,996
Kat, wait.

1666
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:21,129
Uh...

1667
01:18:23,499 --> 01:18:24,834
I don't know what to say,

1668
01:18:24,968 --> 01:18:28,271
because for the first time
in my life...

1669
01:18:28,404 --> 01:18:30,573
I don't know
what my future looks like.

1670
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,241
I understand.

1671
01:18:32,375 --> 01:18:34,243
And for what it's worth,

1672
01:18:34,377 --> 01:18:35,544
no matter what happens,

1673
01:18:35,678 --> 01:18:37,413
I'll always be your right hand.

1674
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:38,581
And my left.

1675
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:40,383
That too.

1676
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:45,387
All right.

1677
01:18:55,498 --> 01:18:57,066
Hey.

1678
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,835
I waited up for you
as long as I could.

1679
01:18:58,968 --> 01:19:00,469
What happened?

1680
01:19:00,603 --> 01:19:03,773
I know maybe there was
a bit of moon-eye going on,

1681
01:19:03,907 --> 01:19:05,975
but it's not reality.

1682
01:19:06,876 --> 01:19:08,878
Reality is Travis and Kat.

1683
01:19:09,012 --> 01:19:10,379
Not me and Travis.

1684
01:19:10,513 --> 01:19:12,415
And I know
that you've found a rancher,

1685
01:19:12,548 --> 01:19:16,684
and you are going to live
happily ever after.

1686
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:18,287
I'm just going to go home,

1687
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:22,458
and I'm going to focus on
making some other changes.

1688
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:23,893
Like with my painting.

1689
01:19:24,861 --> 01:19:26,162
Right?

1690
01:19:28,664 --> 01:19:30,333
Now, let's get going.

1691
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:37,040
So remember,

1692
01:19:37,173 --> 01:19:38,818
she likes her mane
conditioned twice a week,

1693
01:19:38,842 --> 01:19:39,852
and her hooves
will need a polish

1694
01:19:39,876 --> 01:19:41,344
at least every other day

1695
01:19:41,477 --> 01:19:43,446
or else she starts feeling
a bit self-conscious.

1696
01:19:43,579 --> 01:19:45,481
We'll make sure
to take good care of her.

1697
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,483
I'm going to miss her.

1698
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:48,616
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

1699
01:19:48,684 --> 01:19:50,419
One more selfie.

1700
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:53,422
Thanks.

1701
01:19:53,556 --> 01:19:54,858
No problem.

1702
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:02,731
So this is it.

1703
01:20:02,866 --> 01:20:04,633
Yeah, heading back
to the Big Apple

1704
01:20:04,767 --> 01:20:06,936
to lasso a cab home.

1705
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:09,105
Well, I'm sure you'll have
no problem,

1706
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:11,040
seeing as
you're a skilled rancher now.

1707
01:20:11,174 --> 01:20:13,309
Hardly, but thanks.

1708
01:20:15,411 --> 01:20:17,646
Well, I guess
we'd better get going.

1709
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:19,382
Yeah, of course.

1710
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:23,252
You forgot your book.

1711
01:20:23,386 --> 01:20:25,121
It's yours.

1712
01:20:25,254 --> 01:20:27,190
I don't have the gift.

1713
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,367
Well, you don't know
unless you try.

1714
01:20:28,391 --> 01:20:29,925
Right.

1715
01:20:41,237 --> 01:20:43,973
Well, time
to get back to work now.

1716
01:20:54,317 --> 01:20:55,851
- Thanks, babe.
- Of course.

1717
01:20:58,821 --> 01:21:01,257
Well, this is it.

1718
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:03,226
I'm off to the wild, Wild West.

1719
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,693
Well, at least you're not
a rookie anymore.

1720
01:21:05,827 --> 01:21:07,396
I'm going to miss you.

1721
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:09,610
You know we're going to talk,
like, almost every day.

1722
01:21:10,934 --> 01:21:12,101
You're going to be great.

1723
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:14,670
I know.

1724
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:17,139
So are you.

1725
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,146
- Love you.
- Love you more.

1726
01:22:35,351 --> 01:22:38,554
Did you read the review
from our first guests?

1727
01:22:38,687 --> 01:22:39,722
No.

1728
01:22:39,855 --> 01:22:41,590
What'd they say?

1729
01:22:41,724 --> 01:22:43,592
A lot of positive things.

1730
01:22:43,726 --> 01:22:46,029
Especially that Olivia.

1731
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:50,398
In fact, she mentions you
quite a bit,

1732
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:55,404
about how you were the thing
that made her stay so special.

1733
01:22:55,538 --> 01:22:56,672
Really?

1734
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:57,806
She said that?

1735
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,742
Of course she did.

1736
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:01,110
I mean, anyone could see

1737
01:23:01,244 --> 01:23:03,779
how she came
into her own out here,

1738
01:23:03,912 --> 01:23:05,681
with thanks to you.

1739
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:08,351
Look, I can see since she left

1740
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:11,254
that you've been
keeping your head down,

1741
01:23:11,387 --> 01:23:12,987
doing what you do.

1742
01:23:13,121 --> 01:23:15,191
And I could let you be.

1743
01:23:15,324 --> 01:23:18,561
But I don't think
that'll help you.

1744
01:23:18,693 --> 01:23:22,431
So I'm kicking
you off the ranch.

1745
01:23:22,565 --> 01:23:23,599
What?

1746
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:24,800
What do you mean?

1747
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:26,469
I mean that you seem to think

1748
01:23:26,602 --> 01:23:28,242
you've got
everything you need right here,

1749
01:23:28,304 --> 01:23:29,938
but you don't.

1750
01:23:30,073 --> 01:23:31,407
Because what you need

1751
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:32,907
is to go on

1752
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:35,443
one of those adventures
you and your mom talked about.

1753
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:37,180
And head on out to New York.

1754
01:23:38,781 --> 01:23:40,883
You really think so?

1755
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:43,085
Well, she ain't
from Denver, is she?

1756
01:23:44,153 --> 01:23:45,321
No.

1757
01:23:45,454 --> 01:23:47,456
No, she most definitely is not.

1758
01:23:50,293 --> 01:23:51,293
Thanks, Dad.

1759
01:23:51,394 --> 01:23:53,429
Don't mention it.

1760
01:23:53,562 --> 01:23:54,562
Now go on. Git.

1761
01:24:02,371 --> 01:24:03,715
And yeah, I was thinking
instead of Thai tonight

1762
01:24:03,739 --> 01:24:05,259
that I would try
this new Indian place.

1763
01:24:05,308 --> 01:24:06,842
Oh, dang.

1764
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:08,611
I miss takeout food so much.

1765
01:24:08,744 --> 01:24:10,224
Ooh, can you take a photo
of your food

1766
01:24:10,313 --> 01:24:11,347
and send it to me?

1767
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:12,281
Please?

1768
01:24:12,415 --> 01:24:13,482
Yes, of course.

1769
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:14,916
"Dang"?

1770
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,219
Are you all country now?

1771
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,123
Oh, and be careful with those.
They're originals.

1772
01:24:25,228 --> 01:24:26,395
Dang.

1773
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:29,865
I've got to call you back.

1774
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:31,467
Liv?

1775
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:33,501
Liv?

1776
01:24:35,771 --> 01:24:37,048
See, you've got to get
his attention.

1777
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,374
Like this.

1778
01:24:45,214 --> 01:24:46,449
I guess you were right.

1779
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:48,717
I do not have a clue
what I'm doing

1780
01:24:48,851 --> 01:24:49,851
now that I'm here.

1781
01:24:50,853 --> 01:24:51,853
What are you doing here?

1782
01:24:51,987 --> 01:24:56,125
Well, thing is...

1783
01:24:56,259 --> 01:24:59,027
all those acres of land,

1784
01:24:59,162 --> 01:25:00,896
they always felt...

1785
01:25:01,029 --> 01:25:02,231
full...

1786
01:25:02,365 --> 01:25:05,334
you know, of life.

1787
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:08,871
But then after you left...

1788
01:25:09,004 --> 01:25:10,873
it just felt...

1789
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:12,441
empty.

1790
01:25:13,976 --> 01:25:15,744
And I didn't know
what to do about it,

1791
01:25:15,878 --> 01:25:19,415
so my dad told me
to get my butt out here.

1792
01:25:19,548 --> 01:25:20,183
So...

1793
01:25:20,316 --> 01:25:21,750
here I am.

1794
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:24,753
Here...

1795
01:25:24,887 --> 01:25:26,555
here you are.

1796
01:25:28,857 --> 01:25:31,093
Yeah, I get it.

1797
01:25:31,227 --> 01:25:33,228
This feels totally off,
me being here,

1798
01:25:33,362 --> 01:25:36,665
so, clearly,
I don't know what I'm doing,

1799
01:25:36,799 --> 01:25:38,334
so...

1800
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:39,602
No. Travis, wait.

1801
01:25:42,538 --> 01:25:43,772
The only thing off

1802
01:25:43,906 --> 01:25:46,675
is how I've been feeling
since I got back.

1803
01:25:46,809 --> 01:25:51,447
Because all this...

1804
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:52,815
it feels empty, too.

1805
01:25:53,916 --> 01:25:55,584
- Really?
- Yeah.

1806
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:59,555
So what do we do-

1807
01:26:11,234 --> 01:26:12,434
Wish I could do this all day,

1808
01:26:12,568 --> 01:26:14,008
but we've got guests
coming tomorrow.

1809
01:26:14,036 --> 01:26:16,339
I'm sure you've got it
all under control.

1810
01:26:16,472 --> 01:26:17,840
Are you kidding?

1811
01:26:17,973 --> 01:26:19,608
I still have to
sweep out my gallery.

1812
01:26:19,742 --> 01:26:21,453
Then I have to finish
that painting of Daisy

1813
01:26:21,477 --> 01:26:22,978
I promised Justin.

1814
01:26:23,111 --> 01:26:24,623
Then we have to clean out
the chicken coop.

1815
01:26:24,647 --> 01:26:26,148
Oh, and don't forget,

1816
01:26:26,282 --> 01:26:26,982
Amber and Dylan
are coming in a week.

1817
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:27,850
All right.

1818
01:26:27,983 --> 01:26:29,485
I'll let you go.

1819
01:26:29,618 --> 01:26:31,618
I'll just drive those cattle
out to pasture myself.

1820
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:32,853
Huh.

1821
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:34,223
Maybe all that can wait?
