1
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:40,708
Fuck!

2
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,125
<i>It's not</i>
<i>the blood you can't wash out</i>

3
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,761
<i>you should worry about.</i>

4
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,269
<i>It's the blood you can.</i>

5
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,684
Everything all right?

6
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,221
Yeah. I'm fine.
Fine. Why?

7
00:01:30,024 --> 00:01:32,760
You get all that blood
off your hands preacher?

8
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:55,368
Well, he isn't actually
gonna speak, is he?

9
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,374
After all
his wife just died.

10
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,984
I have, uh, pastored
most of y'all for 20 years.

11
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,322
And, uh,
to be honest, I'm--

12
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:17,525
I'm up here...

13
00:04:20,895 --> 00:04:23,030
because I don't know
how to do anything else.

14
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,903
She was the best
part of me.

15
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:33,574
Y'all know it, too.

16
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:37,410
Half the time
you be clamoring

17
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,714
to talk to her
after church and not me.

18
00:04:43,885 --> 00:04:47,955
I've spent
my whole life...

19
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,992
waiting to talk to her.

20
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:58,533
I guess I'll be waiting
a little longer still.

21
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:07,307
A lot of people
have asked me...

22
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:13,480
what I think
of Troy Parker Junior...

23
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,585
about whether
he deserves to pay

24
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,855
for Elizabeth's life
with his own.

25
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,330
Love your enemies.

26
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:36,070
Pray for those
who hate you.

27
00:05:36,771 --> 00:05:40,241
Lord, forgive us
our sins as we forgive

28
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,511
those who have sinned
against us.

29
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:49,917
I believe there is
power in forgiveness.

30
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:51,686
I have to believe that.

31
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,790
Otherwise, my Jesus
is a liar.

32
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:02,462
So I have talked
to the Texas district attorney

33
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:06,901
and requested that
Mr. Parker's sentence...

34
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:12,073
be fair and just...

35
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:16,476
but also with
the possibility of parole...

36
00:06:19,247 --> 00:06:20,781
and redemption.

37
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,466
Hey, you want
dinner in a while?

38
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:12,199
Hey, you coming
down for dinner?

39
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:22,576
Samuel?

40
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,491
Samuel?

41
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,035
Parker!

42
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:25,840
Parker! Troy!

43
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,076
You coming or going?

44
00:08:34,749 --> 00:08:36,150
Bus will be
along any minute.

45
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:14,982
Okay, so
if you come tomorrow--

46
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:16,183
Samuel.

47
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:20,221
Get in the car.

48
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:22,756
Am I in trouble or something?

49
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,492
Why would you assume
you were in trouble?

50
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,761
Because you haven't picked
me up since I was 13 years old.

51
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,635
Troy Parker
is being released today.

52
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:39,173
Mm. Five years, right?

53
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:41,675
'Cause you wouldn't testify?

54
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,177
It was
the right thing to do.

55
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:46,814
Being a pastor don't make you
the expert on what's right.

56
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:53,087
I just thought
you should know.

57
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,625
Hey, can you gimme
a hand at the church tonight?

58
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,058
I got homework.

59
00:10:58,192 --> 00:10:59,594
Samuel, I can't do
everything myself.

60
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:01,395
Sorry.

61
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,400
You planning on
staying long?

62
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,468
No, ma'am.

63
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:45,472
Am I gonna
have trouble with you?

64
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:47,841
No, ma'am.

65
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,485
First, last, and security.

66
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,725
That's just about
all I got.

67
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:20,841
You always this welcoming?

68
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,979
I know who you are.

69
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:30,317
No smoking.

70
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,134
Sheriff's here.

71
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,441
Maureen.

72
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,280
Little early
in the day, ain't it Scott?

73
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:00,948
Come on.
You know what they say?

74
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,284
You can take
the cop outta the big city.

75
00:13:03,417 --> 00:13:04,985
What happened?

76
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:08,355
Was driving by,
saw the truck on fire.

77
00:13:08,489 --> 00:13:09,990
Local fire put it out.

78
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:14,128
That's when they found--

79
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:20,334
-Do we know who it is?
-Not yet.

80
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,505
Coroner's on their way,

81
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:26,240
-but they're in Paris and--
-And they drive slow.

82
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:27,575
Molasses.

83
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:30,344
Any guesses?

84
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,247
Working theory,

85
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,848
traveler passing through
for the night

86
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:36,450
looking for
a place to stay.

87
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:39,186
Doesn't explain
the gas though...

88
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,190
or the tracks.

89
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,326
Sorry, what's that?

90
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,962
Well, sometimes pickup truck
uses different tires

91
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:50,732
than a passenger car.

92
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:53,500
That's a mid-eighties Ford
that's running on LT metrics.

93
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:55,035
This is P.

94
00:13:57,772 --> 00:14:00,140
I always said it was
good for cops to have hobbies.

95
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,443
That's why mine's origami.

96
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:04,478
There was another car.

97
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,184
Right. But, uh,
which means?

98
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,619
This isn't
where it happened.

99
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:16,857
Where are you going?

100
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,025
To find out
where it did.

101
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:20,294
Run the treads.
See where it takes us.

102
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,596
Sure.

103
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,498
I mean, I was gonna do that.
I just-- I--

104
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:53,160
How was
the service pastor?

105
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:59,634
I-- I probably
should have just called.

106
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:02,970
I heard you got out.

107
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:05,439
Yeah, just-- just yesterday.

108
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:09,910
You came back.

109
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:14,214
Did you hear
about my mom?

110
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,384
No.

111
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:20,988
Yeah, she, uh...

112
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:23,625
she fell sick...

113
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:27,695
a little over a year ago
and you know,

114
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:32,266
I figured once I got out
I'd come back and help her out.

115
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,705
You came by here.

116
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,683
Look, you-- you didn't
have to do what you did.

117
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,453
You know, about
my sentence and all.

118
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,324
You're welcome.

119
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:05,999
Yeah. All right.

120
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,404
Hey, Pastor.

121
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:14,809
Hey, you-- you wouldn't
know anyone who'd, you know,

122
00:16:14,943 --> 00:16:16,711
hire an ex-con,
would you?

123
00:16:16,845 --> 00:16:18,412
Afraid not.

124
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,585
Yeah, I didn't think so.

125
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:29,490
Uh, I'll--
I'll let you be.

126
00:16:29,624 --> 00:16:30,592
Thank you, Pastor.

127
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,780
Yes, sir. I'm here.

128
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:58,018
No, sir, I'm not looking
to get into any trouble.

129
00:17:02,122 --> 00:17:03,457
No, sir.

130
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,727
Got no plans
to leave the state.

131
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,665
Uh, yes sir.

132
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:12,767
Go ahead.

133
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:16,571
Uh-huh.

134
00:17:20,675 --> 00:17:21,809
Yes, sir.

135
00:17:22,644 --> 00:17:23,811
Will do.

136
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,748
Thank you, sir.

137
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:33,120
My PO said
he called you?

138
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,055
Haven't heard
a thing about it kid.

139
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:39,059
This is
the only job he sent me.

140
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:42,564
Will then I guess
you're just outta luck.

141
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,734
Thanks for nothing.

142
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,291
-Here let me.
-Oh, I got it.

143
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:23,337
Thank you.

144
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,441
How is
the job hunting going?

145
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:30,277
Well, I ended up
getting fired from a job

146
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,212
I never had
in the first place.

147
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:36,183
Yeah.
Times are tough.

148
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:39,821
Yeah, looks that way.

149
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,761
Uh, have-- have
a good one, Pastor.

150
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,668
If-- if you're looking
for work...

151
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,574
I guess I could--

152
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,176
I guess I could use
your help around here.

153
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,381
Sweeping and--
and cleaning and...

154
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:09,851
basic maintenance.

155
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:14,922
Can't pay much...

156
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:18,559
but maybe
it could help.

157
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:23,330
You, uh...

158
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:26,500
you offering me a job?

159
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:32,640
Yeah.
It looks that way.

160
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:39,747
Yeah.

161
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:41,616
Okay. Sure.

162
00:19:43,851 --> 00:19:45,019
Thanks.

163
00:19:45,753 --> 00:19:48,790
So, uh, what do you
want me to do?

164
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:34,334
Hey, Dad.

165
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,273
Samuel.

166
00:20:42,143 --> 00:20:43,811
Okay. Look, Samuel.
I want--

167
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:45,046
Look, Samuel. Wait.

168
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:49,650
Samuel. Look-- look, he--

169
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:51,753
he came here to take care
of his mom, all right?

170
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:53,688
-He needed a job.
-Do what you want.

171
00:20:53,821 --> 00:20:55,656
-Don't ask me to like it.
-Oh, Samuel, come on now.

172
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,491
-Your mother would've wanted--
-Hey, don't do that!

173
00:20:58,391 --> 00:20:59,994
Don't even think
about doing that.

174
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:05,398
You stay away
from me.

175
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:25,820
I'm sorry.

176
00:21:26,587 --> 00:21:28,421
Just another reason
to get outta here.

177
00:21:30,892 --> 00:21:32,860
Did you hear
from Brown yet?

178
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:35,229
Not yet.

179
00:21:35,797 --> 00:21:37,832
I need a full ride
so not really an incentive

180
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,167
to accept me.

181
00:21:39,934 --> 00:21:43,905
Well, at least you're majoring
in public policy.

182
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,542
Gonna change the world.

183
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:50,678
I, on the other hand,
am going to be

184
00:21:50,812 --> 00:21:53,346
a sausage cook at
the local Sizzler.

185
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,315
The world needs
good sausage cooks.

186
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:57,185
<i>♪ Finding my way ♪</i>

00:21:57,317 --> 00:22:00,387
<i>♪ But I don't know how ♪</i>

188
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:02,990
You gonna talk to him?

189
00:22:03,925 --> 00:22:05,226
We don't talk.

190
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:07,895
-You live in the same house.
-It's not a home though.

191
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:10,832
Ain't been since--

192
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,069
since Mom.

193
00:22:17,538 --> 00:22:19,073

197
00:22:26,614 --> 00:22:28,348

I'm sorry babe.

202
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:18,159
I-- I've been
meaning to get here.

203
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:22,930
It's just--
I don't forget.

204
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,567
Just--

205
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:29,737
sometimes it's hard
to remember.

206
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:34,775
Yeah, I wanna believe
that Samuel

207
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:37,111
comes by here
every now and again.

208
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:41,782
I hope he does.

209
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,488
I'm losing him.

210
00:24:54,562 --> 00:24:56,030
Nah, I lost him.

211
00:24:58,966 --> 00:25:01,502
I've lost him.
And I-- I don't know where.

212
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,709
I promise you,
I promise you I'll--

213
00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:12,213
I will keep trying.

214
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:18,185
In the meantime,
it seems like there's somebody

215
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:19,787
I'm supposed to help.

216
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:24,658
I just hope
this is what you want.

217
00:25:50,484 --> 00:25:51,819
What are you doing?

218
00:25:53,387 --> 00:25:54,855
Light was out.

219
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:59,727
I don't know.
Felt wrong.

220
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:03,731
Tell you what...

221
00:26:03,864 --> 00:26:05,933
this place's in better shape

222
00:26:06,067 --> 00:26:08,235
than the chapel at Koppelman.

223
00:26:11,472 --> 00:26:13,240
Yeah. Koppelman.

224
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:14,509
You been?

225
00:26:15,342 --> 00:26:18,712
Uh, I used to get called
out there every now and again

226
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:21,348
before they got
a full-time chaplain.

227
00:26:21,482 --> 00:26:24,085
Yeah, Chaplain Kerry.

228
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:26,687
Met with him
once or twice.

229
00:26:33,594 --> 00:26:34,929
Was it hard...

230
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:38,866
what you did,
forgiving me?

231
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:43,304
Yes.

232
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:48,175
So why'd you do it?

233
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:50,711
You think
I shouldn't have?

234
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:00,821
You know, I met
a lot of guys in there.

235
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:04,291
Guys just like me.

236
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:08,162
No dads...

237
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:14,001
dropouts, screw ups.

238
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:21,642
I mean...

239
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:26,247
maybe we don't
deserve to get out.

240
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:34,088
Maybe we don't
deserve to be forgiven.

241
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:44,431
God forgives.

242
00:27:49,403 --> 00:27:50,738
Yeah.

243
00:27:56,043 --> 00:27:59,914
A lot of people said
that I shouldn't.

244
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,251
Lot of people...

245
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,255
said you didn't get
what you deserved.

246
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:15,296
The older I get,
I-- I realize that...

247
00:28:17,532 --> 00:28:18,999
when we don't forgive...

248
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:24,471
we're the ones
who suffer the most.

249
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:29,977
I've suffered enough.

250
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,017
Uh, pastor.

251
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,490
Oh, hey, Willis,
um, we'll go to my office.

252
00:28:44,792 --> 00:28:46,360
Duty calls. Um--

253
00:28:47,562 --> 00:28:49,096
That there. That's good.

254
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:55,736
What? Got something
in my teeth?

255
00:29:03,377 --> 00:29:06,648
The county's already
handling the deed transfer,

256
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,916
so we're done.

257
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,418
Yeah, your momma
talked about doing this

258
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:15,657
before she passed, but
I didn't think she was serious.

259
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:18,826
Yeah, you can
thank her someday.

260
00:29:20,794 --> 00:29:22,129
It needs
a lot of work.

261
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:25,165
Yeah, I know.
I know.

262
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,376
This is the best job
you could get?

263
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,280
Guess so.

264
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:40,914
What do you want?

265
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,486
I'm just here
to take care of my mom, kid.

266
00:29:52,026 --> 00:29:53,394
How did she die?

267
00:30:03,337 --> 00:30:04,639
You really
want to talk about this?

268
00:30:04,773 --> 00:30:06,106
No, I don't.
But here we are.

269
00:30:08,743 --> 00:30:10,144
I wanna know
what you did.

270
00:30:12,112 --> 00:30:14,081
I wanna know
what her last breath was like.

271
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:23,824
It was an accident.

272
00:30:23,957 --> 00:30:25,527
An accident.

273
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:29,363
-It's true.
-Says who?

274
00:30:30,598 --> 00:30:31,899
You?

275
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:35,637
-You don't wanna hear about it.
-Yes, I do.

276
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,438
No, you don't.

277
00:30:38,939 --> 00:30:40,274
So that's it?

278
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:44,845
Stay outta my sight...

279
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:48,817
or I won't be responsible
for what happens.

280
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:50,250
And who will?

281
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:52,554
God?

282
00:30:53,722 --> 00:30:55,289
I don't believe in God.

283
00:31:18,546 --> 00:31:21,949
What? What?
He-- he just walked out?

284
00:31:23,417 --> 00:31:25,386
No. No.
It is not like him at all.

285
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,021
But hang on.
Yeah, he-- he-- he's here now.

286
00:31:28,155 --> 00:31:29,390
I'll call you back.

287
00:31:29,524 --> 00:31:30,625
Samuel.

288
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:32,426
Excuse me!

289
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,195
Samuel! Boy, turn around.

290
00:31:35,329 --> 00:31:36,430
What?

291
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:38,499
Your principal just called.

292
00:31:38,966 --> 00:31:40,134
What'd she say?

293
00:31:40,267 --> 00:31:42,369
She said you cut today?

294
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:43,605
Yeah?

295
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:47,975
What is this?
What-- what are you doing?

296
00:31:48,108 --> 00:31:49,677
What are you doing?

297
00:31:52,514 --> 00:31:53,681
Okay.

298
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:55,949
This is about Troy.

299
00:31:57,585 --> 00:31:59,253
Would you like to
come down and talk about--

300
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:00,454
I don't.

301
00:32:04,158 --> 00:32:07,494
She's giving you a break
because you're my son.

302
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:10,497
You cut again,
there will be consequences.

303
00:32:10,632 --> 00:32:12,065
Okay. Thank you.

304
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:13,768
Look, Samuel,
I'm doing the best I can here.

305
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,077
Maureen.

306
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:26,815
Got your autopsy report.

307
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:28,750
Boy, are they slow.

308
00:32:28,883 --> 00:32:30,552
-Joe has the file?
-Yeah.

309
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:34,221
It wasn't a drifter.

310
00:32:34,988 --> 00:32:36,658
Who was it?

311
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:38,927
Why don't you
take a look?

312
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,166
Yep.

313
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:49,904
Hmm...

314
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:05,620
It's all yours?

315
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,756
-Hell of a place.
-Church's.

316
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:13,728
I'm gonna turn it
into a home

317
00:33:13,862 --> 00:33:15,362
for abused women.

318
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:19,500
A place where they can
find a little hope.

319
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,539
Needs a lot
of work, doesn't it?

320
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:28,175
Yes, it does.

321
00:33:36,016 --> 00:33:37,317
Let's go.

322
00:33:37,752 --> 00:33:38,987
Three!

323
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:54,862
You-- you all right?

324
00:34:58,933 --> 00:35:02,537
Uh, yeah.
Just some old battle wounds.

325
00:35:04,973 --> 00:35:06,541
So, halfway house, huh?

326
00:35:09,544 --> 00:35:10,745
Yeah.

327
00:35:12,714 --> 00:35:14,782
That's what Elizabeth
always wanted.

328
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:19,219
Hmm.

329
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:21,723
She always got
what she wanted...

330
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:25,158
sooner or later.

331
00:35:31,131 --> 00:35:32,700
What was she like?

332
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,005
I'm sorry.

333
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,306
-Look, I didn't mean--
-Mm-mm.

334
00:36:14,408 --> 00:36:15,710
I didn't mean to.

335
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:18,546
-I just--
-Our last talk...

336
00:36:20,915 --> 00:36:22,050
was a fight.

337
00:36:29,057 --> 00:36:31,693
You're saying things
you don't even mean...

338
00:36:36,064 --> 00:36:38,298
and then 24 hours later,

339
00:36:38,432 --> 00:36:40,902
all you hear
are all the...

340
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:44,337
awful things you said

341
00:36:44,471 --> 00:36:48,341
rattling around
your head like ghosts.

342
00:36:55,183 --> 00:36:56,884
And all you
have are ghosts.

343
00:37:06,694 --> 00:37:08,896
She wanted me
to take her out on a date.

344
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,735
She wasn't wrong either.

345
00:37:13,868 --> 00:37:16,971
I-- I never got
that part right.

346
00:37:18,673 --> 00:37:22,309
Always spending
all my time taking care

347
00:37:22,442 --> 00:37:24,512
of everybody else
at the expense of us.

348
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,548
Bad habit.

349
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:31,284
Pastor habit.

350
00:37:39,627 --> 00:37:41,796
I'm sorry
I walked away like that.

351
00:37:44,232 --> 00:37:45,600
It's fine.

352
00:37:49,036 --> 00:37:53,306
You know what you're saying,
it's honest.

353
00:37:57,512 --> 00:37:59,947
There's something wrong
with being honest?

354
00:38:01,783 --> 00:38:05,285
People don't want
their pastors honest.

355
00:38:07,121 --> 00:38:08,689
They want 'em perfect.

356
00:38:14,128 --> 00:38:15,295
Why?

357
00:38:15,797 --> 00:38:18,800
To give 'em someone
to look up to?

358
00:38:21,035 --> 00:38:22,603
Someone to resent.

359
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:26,774
Geez.

360
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:28,876
Not a lot
of hope there.

361
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:34,882
Your job
is to give them hope.

362
00:38:36,651 --> 00:38:37,985
Give them the hope.

363
00:38:38,853 --> 00:38:42,657
Where's the hope?
Don't forget the hope.

364
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:47,929
That's what
she used to say.

365
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:02,510
I am sorry.

366
00:39:06,346 --> 00:39:08,082
I already forgave you.

367
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:11,986
Some things
take work, you know.

368
00:39:21,095 --> 00:39:25,099
It's not the blood
you can't wash out

369
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:26,701
you should worry about.

370
00:39:28,468 --> 00:39:30,238
It's the blood you can.

371
00:39:55,296 --> 00:39:56,664
Don't tell Dad.

372
00:39:57,298 --> 00:39:58,398
You too.

373
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:04,639
Hey, so,
what are we celebrating?

374
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:08,441
What?

375
00:40:10,544 --> 00:40:12,113
I got a letter.

376
00:40:13,848 --> 00:40:14,715
Brown?

377
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:17,952
Yeah. I got in.
Full ride.

378
00:40:18,552 --> 00:40:20,054
Samuel. That's--

379
00:40:21,454 --> 00:40:22,857
I know.

380
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,860
<i>♪ Too hard to hold onto ♪</i>

381
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,995
So what did
your dad say?

382
00:40:30,731 --> 00:40:32,465
-I'm sorry. I should--
-It-- it's okay.

383
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,069
<i>♪ So hard to hold on ♪</i>

384
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:36,570
I didn't tell him yet.

385
00:40:37,538 --> 00:40:38,706
Why not?

386
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:41,042
Because he was
gone all day.

387
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:42,777
Hanging out
with his new employee.

388
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:43,978
Yep.

389
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,449
<i>♪ And I need you to stay ♪</i>

390
00:40:51,352 --> 00:40:53,888
<i>♪ So hard to hold onto ♪</i>

391
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:06,801
The hell is this?

392
00:41:07,902 --> 00:41:09,437
There a problem here?

393
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:11,772
There wasn't one
till they let you in here.

394
00:41:12,673 --> 00:41:14,141
And why wouldn't they?

395
00:41:15,743 --> 00:41:17,244
-Clear out.
-Lay off.

396
00:41:17,378 --> 00:41:18,946
I want him outta here.

397
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,948
Look, I'm just trying
to have a drink with this lo--

398
00:41:21,082 --> 00:41:23,017
I said
get the hell out!

399
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:25,820
All right.
Both of you out!

400
00:41:29,423 --> 00:41:32,093
You know that anger
is a real problem, kid.

401
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,701
You too, Samuel.

402
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:46,640
He did his time.

403
00:41:46,774 --> 00:41:48,075
Not enough.

404
00:41:49,443 --> 00:41:51,012
Look, this side of you...

405
00:41:53,447 --> 00:41:54,682
it scares me.

406
00:42:00,287 --> 00:42:01,555
Let me out here.

407
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,126
I'll walk.
Clear my head.

408
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,972
Here.

409
00:42:18,873 --> 00:42:21,142
My dad wants me
to stay safe.

410
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:23,177
Anyway, just take it.

411
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:26,580
Just in case he comes
after you or something.

412
00:42:29,283 --> 00:42:30,618
I love you.

413
00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:33,187
You shouldn't.

414
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:53,774
When were you
gonna tell me?

415
00:42:54,942 --> 00:42:56,310
What you talking about?

416
00:42:57,812 --> 00:42:59,180
Full ride?

417
00:42:59,947 --> 00:43:02,716
Yeah.
Came yesterday.

418
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:05,352
Samuel, this is
a big deal.

419
00:43:06,487 --> 00:43:09,290
I mean, it-- it is
everything you worked for.

420
00:43:10,925 --> 00:43:12,793
You didn't wanna tell me?

421
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:15,296
You've been spending
all your time with Troy, so.

422
00:43:19,534 --> 00:43:20,968
He's playing you.

423
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:24,573
Someday you gonna learn. Okay?

424
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:28,442
All this anger is just gonna
rot you from the inside out.

425
00:43:28,577 --> 00:43:30,010
Okay.

426
00:43:31,045 --> 00:43:32,947
Look, Samuel,
I'm trying here.

427
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,152
Thanks.

428
00:43:49,531 --> 00:43:50,764
Yep, that's right.

429
00:43:50,898 --> 00:43:52,766
The early bird
catches the worm.

430
00:43:54,368 --> 00:43:55,870
Who owns this place?

431
00:43:57,506 --> 00:43:58,939
Technically nobody.

432
00:43:59,473 --> 00:44:00,774
Technically?

433
00:44:01,576 --> 00:44:03,811
Well, this piece
of land belonged

434
00:44:03,944 --> 00:44:05,479
to the Jo Hanson family.

435
00:44:05,614 --> 00:44:06,881
Mm-hmm.

436
00:44:07,014 --> 00:44:09,083
Mary Jo Hanson
died six months ago

437
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:11,418
and the rest of the family
left out of state.

438
00:44:12,453 --> 00:44:13,854
So who owns it now?

439
00:44:15,356 --> 00:44:17,791
Well, apparently
she gave it to the church.

440
00:44:34,576 --> 00:44:35,876
Hey, pastor.

441
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:40,114
Oh, good.
So your phone does work.

442
00:44:41,415 --> 00:44:43,751
Yeah. Um, I'm sorry.

443
00:44:44,553 --> 00:44:46,220
Late night.

444
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:48,422
What do you
wanna do today?

445
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:52,226
You know what?
Have a seat.

446
00:44:53,027 --> 00:44:54,695
Go on. Go on.

447
00:45:04,104 --> 00:45:06,807
Did you, uh,
did you ever pray

448
00:45:06,941 --> 00:45:09,843
with Chaplain Kerry
when you were in prison?

449
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,348
He asked me to
a couple times.

450
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:17,351
Wanted me to pray the--

451
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:19,588
what do you call it?
The-- the--

452
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,255
the sinner's prayer.

453
00:45:25,426 --> 00:45:27,127
But you didn't want to.

454
00:45:29,096 --> 00:45:31,465
I mean,
I know who I am.

455
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,467
Don't need
to tell God.

456
00:45:37,672 --> 00:45:39,273
Yeah.

457
00:45:40,774 --> 00:45:44,345
You see,
that's the thing though.

458
00:45:47,214 --> 00:45:50,351
God already knows
who you've been.

459
00:45:53,622 --> 00:45:55,022
He wants to know...

460
00:45:56,857 --> 00:45:58,759
who do you wanna be.

461
00:46:01,663 --> 00:46:03,264
So it's a confession...

462
00:46:04,532 --> 00:46:05,933
of need...

463
00:46:10,004 --> 00:46:11,405
a request for help...

464
00:46:14,509 --> 00:46:15,809
and a pledge.

465
00:46:16,678 --> 00:46:18,345
A pledge to live different.

466
00:46:23,217 --> 00:46:25,152
All the things
you've done...

467
00:46:28,623 --> 00:46:30,157
where you've been...

468
00:46:32,126 --> 00:46:33,894
what you've seen.

469
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:37,666
All the--
the failures and mistakes,

470
00:46:37,798 --> 00:46:39,800
those are the past.

471
00:46:57,552 --> 00:46:59,219
Who you've been...

472
00:47:01,121 --> 00:47:04,058
does not have to be
who you are...

473
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:12,399
if you are willing
to believe.

474
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:23,844
Will you pray with me?

475
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:30,317
Father God...

476
00:47:33,053 --> 00:47:37,424
we come to you right now
humbled and broken.

477
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:41,061
Thank you--

478
00:48:27,542 --> 00:48:28,576
No kidding.

479
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:30,110
Yeah.

480
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:31,813
Everything he always wanted,
you know,

481
00:48:31,945 --> 00:48:36,116
a major in public policy,
learn the judicial system.

482
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,985
Then you
must be proud.

483
00:48:38,686 --> 00:48:40,588
Yeah.
I am. I am.

484
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:42,189
You tell him?

485
00:48:42,322 --> 00:48:43,858
Well, yeah, he knows.

486
00:48:43,991 --> 00:48:45,359
You know.

487
00:48:46,193 --> 00:48:47,529
You sure he knows?

488
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,431
Yeah. I will--
I will make sure.

489
00:48:50,565 --> 00:48:51,666
In the meantime.

490
00:48:56,871 --> 00:48:58,205
What's this?

491
00:48:59,373 --> 00:49:02,943
It's just a-- a little
place you can call your own.

492
00:49:03,076 --> 00:49:05,580
You know, you can,
um, when you can think

493
00:49:05,713 --> 00:49:09,316
or work, whatever.

494
00:49:10,752 --> 00:49:13,020
There's also this.

495
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:17,958
What's that?
Is that a Bible?

496
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:19,894
Uh, it's a journal actually.

497
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:23,230
Uh, a prayer journal.
See, you write your prayers in.

498
00:49:23,363 --> 00:49:27,134
You know, I'm not really
that good of a writer.

499
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:30,939
Yeah, me neither.
But I-- I got a whole stack.

500
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:34,174
So I can look back
and remember what I prayed for

501
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:38,078
and then remember
where God showed up, so.

502
00:49:40,113 --> 00:49:42,249
Job never stops
for you, does it?

503
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:45,352
No, it does not.

504
00:49:46,987 --> 00:49:48,255
You know, come on.

505
00:49:48,388 --> 00:49:49,691
I'll give you
a ride home.

506
00:49:49,824 --> 00:49:51,593
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

507
00:49:51,726 --> 00:49:53,126
Thanks.

508
00:49:58,265 --> 00:50:01,001
All right.
How's your mom doing?

509
00:50:03,905 --> 00:50:05,072
She's doing all right.

510
00:50:05,205 --> 00:50:06,875
You know,
I'd see her more,

511
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:09,176
but I got a side hustle at this
church keeping me really busy.

512
00:50:09,309 --> 00:50:11,345
Yeah.

513
00:50:11,478 --> 00:50:13,781
Yeah, I hear
that Pastor is a piece of work.

514
00:50:13,915 --> 00:50:15,617
You know, he--
he is something.

515
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,851
He is something.

516
00:50:16,985 --> 00:50:18,686
All right.

517
00:50:19,787 --> 00:50:21,355
Let's get you home.

518
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:26,460
Hey, thanks again
for today.

519
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:30,832
My pleasure.
My pleasure.

520
00:50:39,774 --> 00:50:41,141
All righty.

521
00:50:41,743 --> 00:50:44,579
Home sweet home.
Thanks for the ride.

522
00:50:44,712 --> 00:50:46,179
Yeah, of course.

523
00:50:47,649 --> 00:50:49,684
Hey, you wanna come up?
See the place?

524
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:52,020
You know, maybe have
a beer or something?

525
00:50:52,152 --> 00:50:55,055
Uh, probably not
a beer, huh?

526
00:50:55,757 --> 00:50:57,424
N-- n-- no.

527
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:59,359
-Prob-- probably not.
-You like water?

528
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:06,601
Yeah. Water would be great.

529
00:51:22,717 --> 00:51:25,385
Um, nice place.

530
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:28,121
A little--
little small, isn't it?

531
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:31,425
As long as I can stretch out,
I'm good.

532
00:51:32,961 --> 00:51:36,898
Uh, you didn't wanna
move back with your mom?

533
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:40,668
Um, you know,
me and her...

534
00:51:40,802 --> 00:51:43,103
we're sort of better
with a little distance.

535
00:51:45,807 --> 00:51:46,874
Yeah.

536
00:51:49,176 --> 00:51:50,612
Samuel is the same way.

537
00:51:54,048 --> 00:51:55,817
Parents and kids, right?

538
00:52:02,155 --> 00:52:04,358
I guess
that's why he, uh,

539
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:06,561
why he wants to leave.

540
00:52:07,962 --> 00:52:09,262
He wants his space.

541
00:52:12,232 --> 00:52:14,234
The truth is,
he's never home

542
00:52:14,368 --> 00:52:15,637
even when he is there...

543
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:19,306
especially lately.

544
00:52:20,908 --> 00:52:22,175
He thinks I'm--

545
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:25,713
I'm making
a mistake with you.

546
00:52:27,915 --> 00:52:29,584
Wasting my time.

547
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,422
Lonely thing
trying to save people.

548
00:52:39,727 --> 00:52:41,929
Lonelier still when
it's your own son.

549
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:49,737
I've always been
a better pastor than a father.

550
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,808
Same thing, isn't it?

551
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:57,545
Yeah, well, he--

552
00:52:58,278 --> 00:53:01,248
he stopped listening to me
a long time ago.

553
00:53:03,117 --> 00:53:05,318
Doesn't mean
you stop trying.

554
00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:09,524
Look, pastor...

555
00:53:10,892 --> 00:53:12,392
keep the faith.

556
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,930
If you don't, who will?

557
00:53:22,335 --> 00:53:24,739
Yeah, I better--
I better get going.

558
00:53:36,283 --> 00:53:37,719
Don't forget to use this.

559
00:53:40,253 --> 00:53:41,589
I'll do my best.

560
00:53:43,124 --> 00:53:44,625
Good night.

561
00:54:48,189 --> 00:54:49,456
Little late, huh?

562
00:54:54,629 --> 00:54:56,363
Yeah, I guess so.

563
00:54:59,534 --> 00:55:00,868
How about you?
What did you do?

564
00:55:01,368 --> 00:55:02,703
Homework at Kaitlyn's.

565
00:55:03,971 --> 00:55:05,039
You?

566
00:55:06,674 --> 00:55:08,943
Oh, just left the church.

567
00:55:10,144 --> 00:55:11,411
You know, working late.

568
00:55:17,185 --> 00:55:18,485
Everything okay?

569
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:20,588
It's fine.

570
00:55:29,964 --> 00:55:31,032
Okay.

571
00:55:31,666 --> 00:55:33,601
-See you tomorrow.
-Look...

572
00:55:36,103 --> 00:55:40,007
I-- I know you hate
what I'm doing with Troy.

573
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:41,474
Figured that out yourself, huh?

574
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:43,778
I'm not
asking you to understand...

575
00:55:45,513 --> 00:55:48,816
but I need you
to trust me son.

576
00:55:50,284 --> 00:55:51,552
Trust you?

577
00:55:53,321 --> 00:55:54,589
Yeah.

578
00:55:55,355 --> 00:55:57,124
He killed mom.

579
00:55:58,726 --> 00:56:00,895
-I know.
-He killed her.

580
00:56:01,461 --> 00:56:04,397
I know.

581
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,500
He killed her.

582
00:56:09,136 --> 00:56:10,437
He killed her.

583
00:56:10,571 --> 00:56:12,773
-How can you just forgive?
-I can't.

584
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:17,912
I can't.

585
00:56:19,647 --> 00:56:21,349
I never thought
I'd see him again.

586
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:25,152
It's one thing to-- to forgive
someone from far away.

587
00:56:25,286 --> 00:56:27,054
It's another to do it

588
00:56:27,188 --> 00:56:30,057
up close day in, day out.

589
00:56:32,727 --> 00:56:34,095
But if I don't, then...

590
00:56:38,132 --> 00:56:39,600
what did she die for?

591
00:56:42,870 --> 00:56:44,437
What good comes of it?

592
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:47,008
Nothing.

593
00:56:48,009 --> 00:56:50,945
She died so that
you could save his soul.

594
00:56:51,078 --> 00:56:53,514
Mm-mm, she died...

595
00:56:57,585 --> 00:57:00,922
and God is
giving me a chance...

596
00:57:02,657 --> 00:57:05,092
to make something
out of it.

597
00:57:07,995 --> 00:57:09,130
You too.

598
00:57:15,036 --> 00:57:16,103
Come on.

599
00:57:23,177 --> 00:57:25,880
I got you. I got you.

600
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:49,370
About that time.

601
00:57:49,937 --> 00:57:51,505
Well, there's no such thing
as that time

602
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:53,240
when you are a pastor.

603
00:57:55,209 --> 00:57:56,644
Ever wish there was?

604
00:57:56,777 --> 00:57:58,379
Just about every time
I look at my paycheck.

605
00:57:58,512 --> 00:57:59,947
Oh.

606
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:03,718
You-- you gonna be
all right getting home?

607
00:58:03,851 --> 00:58:06,053
Uh, yeah.
I'll be all right.

608
00:58:07,254 --> 00:58:08,956
You gonna be
all right getting home?

609
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:11,525
I'll be all right.

610
00:58:11,659 --> 00:58:12,994
All right.

611
00:58:13,493 --> 00:58:14,762
All right.

612
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:17,999
Have a good night, pastor.

613
00:58:18,432 --> 00:58:19,700
Yeah, you too, Troy.

614
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:23,237
You too.

615
00:58:55,102 --> 00:58:56,170
Hey.

616
00:58:59,673 --> 00:59:00,841
Get in.

617
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:15,956
Thanks for the ride.

618
00:59:51,225 --> 00:59:53,127
Your dad told me about Brown.

619
00:59:55,029 --> 00:59:57,198
You must be really excited
to get outta here...

620
00:59:58,799 --> 00:59:59,900
just like I was.

621
01:00:00,034 --> 01:00:01,802
I'm nothing like you.

622
01:00:03,938 --> 01:00:05,372
We're all the same, kid.

623
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:08,909
We've all sinned.

624
01:00:10,044 --> 01:00:11,779
That's what
your dad taught me.

625
01:00:30,764 --> 01:00:32,032
It was quick.

626
01:00:34,702 --> 01:00:35,970
What?

627
01:00:36,904 --> 01:00:41,075
Your mother,
how it happened.

628
01:00:45,012 --> 01:00:46,814
That was the worst part...

629
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:51,886
she didn't fight it.

630
01:00:55,990 --> 01:00:58,325
I held her
in my arms as she died.

631
01:01:00,127 --> 01:01:01,996
Bleeding out
all over your floor.

632
01:01:09,904 --> 01:01:11,506
It was
supposed to be quick.

633
01:01:12,106 --> 01:01:14,008
Just a little
smash-and-grab.

634
01:01:14,775 --> 01:01:16,210
I didn't think
anyone was home...

635
01:01:21,248 --> 01:01:23,083
then she came
into the kitchen.

636
01:01:25,953 --> 01:01:28,088
I got scared I-- I fired.

637
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:39,033
I'll never forget
what she said to me.

638
01:01:42,637 --> 01:01:44,038
It's been five years...

639
01:01:45,739 --> 01:01:47,107
and I've never forgotten.

640
01:01:51,912 --> 01:01:53,247
"I forgive you."

641
01:01:57,985 --> 01:02:00,020
Like what
kind of person does that?

642
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:05,092
Could I do that?

643
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:11,365
Could you?

644
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:37,057
Go ahead.

645
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:39,260
Make it quick.

646
01:02:41,061 --> 01:02:42,463
I won't fight it either.

647
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:15,389
Troy?

648
01:04:27,535 --> 01:04:28,603
Dad.

649
01:04:29,903 --> 01:04:31,171
What happened?

650
01:04:44,652 --> 01:04:45,953
Did someone see you?

651
01:04:47,121 --> 01:04:48,922
No, no, no.
No one saw me.

652
01:04:49,356 --> 01:04:50,658
Troy.

653
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,897
You-- you--
you need to move this.

654
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,867
-You need to get it outta here.
-What am I supposed to do?

655
01:04:58,999 --> 01:05:00,334
I don't know.
I don't-- I don't care.

656
01:05:00,467 --> 01:05:02,136
-Just get it out of here.
-Okay, fine.

657
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:03,772
I-- I-- I'll ditch the car
by the side of the road.

658
01:05:03,904 --> 01:05:06,106
I-- I-- I'll wipe it clean.
It-- it'll be fine.

659
01:05:06,741 --> 01:05:08,008
No, no, it won't.

660
01:05:08,743 --> 01:05:10,110
The police are gonna
come looking for him,

661
01:05:10,244 --> 01:05:11,679
when they do I-- I--

662
01:05:12,346 --> 01:05:13,848
What-- what--
Are you gonna tell 'em?

663
01:05:13,981 --> 01:05:15,750
-The man is dead.
-You're my father!

664
01:05:15,884 --> 01:05:17,685
-What am I supposed to do?
-You sided with him

665
01:05:17,819 --> 01:05:19,219
after he killed my mother!

666
01:05:19,987 --> 01:05:21,856
Huh? Now you--

667
01:05:21,989 --> 01:05:23,123
you are gonna
side with the police.

668
01:05:23,257 --> 01:05:25,959
Who-- who's side
are you on, dad?

669
01:05:28,061 --> 01:05:29,329
Uh!

670
01:05:30,431 --> 01:05:34,067
Fine, I'll get
the same five years he did.

671
01:05:35,837 --> 01:05:36,905
No you won't.

672
01:05:37,639 --> 01:05:39,973
What--
what are you talking about?

673
01:05:40,107 --> 01:05:41,375
You're 18.

674
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:43,343
You're a Black man in Texas.

675
01:05:43,745 --> 01:05:46,548
You-- you get
premeditated homicide,

676
01:05:46,681 --> 01:05:48,182
life without parole.

677
01:05:48,315 --> 01:05:50,552
He gets five years
and I get life?

678
01:05:51,853 --> 01:05:52,953
Wa-- was it an accident?

679
01:06:07,234 --> 01:06:10,237
Just gimme a heads up
before you call 'em.

680
01:06:14,843 --> 01:06:16,109
Take my car.

681
01:06:17,879 --> 01:06:19,146
What?

682
01:06:20,949 --> 01:06:22,282
Take my car and go home.

683
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:24,619
What are you gonna do?

684
01:06:24,752 --> 01:06:26,386
Go home!

685
01:11:48,075 --> 01:11:50,611
You get all that blood
off your hands, preacher.

686
01:16:42,169 --> 01:16:43,737
Dad, what did you do?

687
01:16:44,338 --> 01:16:45,840
Don't ask me.

688
01:16:47,808 --> 01:16:48,976
What did you do, daddy?

689
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:51,112
Don't ask me...

690
01:16:52,446 --> 01:16:53,714
ever.

691
01:16:55,483 --> 01:16:56,518
Do you understand?

692
01:17:01,789 --> 01:17:02,990
Go to school.

693
01:17:52,406 --> 01:17:53,674
Marshall?

694
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,751
You're positive?

695
01:18:03,884 --> 01:18:05,452
As positive as we can be.

696
01:18:07,688 --> 01:18:08,956
That is--

697
01:18:09,924 --> 01:18:11,091
that is horrible.

698
01:18:11,225 --> 01:18:12,293
Mm.

699
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:14,529
I-- I understand
from his PO

700
01:18:14,663 --> 01:18:15,963
that he was
working for you.

701
01:18:16,631 --> 01:18:18,399
Uh, part-time. Yeah.

702
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:21,268
I mean, he was
having trouble finding a job.

703
01:18:21,402 --> 01:18:23,003
Yeah, you don't think
he could have found a job

704
01:18:23,137 --> 01:18:25,072
in any other fine
church in this town?

705
01:18:25,206 --> 01:18:27,274
No, I don't know, Maureen,
he came to me.

706
01:18:27,408 --> 01:18:28,976
I wonder why
he came back at all.

707
01:18:29,109 --> 01:18:30,512
Well, his mom is sick.

708
01:18:30,645 --> 01:18:32,046
His mom was dead.

709
01:18:34,448 --> 01:18:36,551
She fell ill
a couple years ago.

710
01:18:36,685 --> 01:18:38,252
Died fast.

711
01:18:39,053 --> 01:18:40,321
What, then-- what?

712
01:18:41,488 --> 01:18:42,756
You didn't know.

713
01:18:44,425 --> 01:18:46,026
And you don't think
that maybe you just--

714
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,662
you just brought him on

715
01:18:47,795 --> 01:18:49,396
so you could
keep an eye on him?

716
01:18:50,364 --> 01:18:52,099
Wait for a moment
that was vulnerable.

717
01:18:52,567 --> 01:18:54,134
I don't know and I gotta ask--

718
01:18:54,268 --> 01:18:56,203
I gotta ask the questions.
That's my job.

719
01:18:59,006 --> 01:19:00,908
No, we--
we didn't talk a whole lot.

720
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:04,278
He-- he worked mostly.
That's pretty much it.

721
01:19:06,548 --> 01:19:07,948
Where were you that night?

722
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:10,818
Here, working.

723
01:19:11,252 --> 01:19:12,319
All night?

724
01:19:13,420 --> 01:19:15,256
Well,
eventually I did go home.

725
01:19:15,389 --> 01:19:16,457
Uh-huh.

726
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:18,292
Samuel can vouch for that?

727
01:19:19,159 --> 01:19:21,428
-Yeah, sure.
-I mean, maybe you just

728
01:19:21,563 --> 01:19:23,030
don't have anything to do
with this at all?

729
01:19:23,163 --> 01:19:24,465
I don't know,
I just have to know

730
01:19:24,599 --> 01:19:26,333
-what I gotta know, you know?
-Hmm.

731
01:19:28,536 --> 01:19:31,038
Hmm. So I'll be in touch.

732
01:19:34,609 --> 01:19:36,076
You're kind.

733
01:19:37,911 --> 01:19:39,179
What you were
trying to do for Troy,

734
01:19:39,313 --> 01:19:40,814
it's better
than I would've done.

735
01:19:42,983 --> 01:19:44,918
He was lost.

736
01:19:46,020 --> 01:19:47,288
We all are.

737
01:19:50,024 --> 01:19:51,392
Don't disappear
on me, Marshall.

738
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,055
Okay...

739
01:21:12,707 --> 01:21:14,441
Did you know anything about it?

740
01:21:18,045 --> 01:21:19,313
No.

741
01:21:21,081 --> 01:21:22,449
I wish I did though.

742
01:21:24,318 --> 01:21:27,488
- I thank whoever did it.
- Oh!

743
01:21:27,622 --> 01:21:28,623
So you're glad about it?

744
01:21:28,757 --> 01:21:30,023
Wouldn't you be?

745
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:37,231
Y'all got any suspects?

746
01:21:37,866 --> 01:21:39,166
A few suspicions.

747
01:21:41,569 --> 01:21:43,638
You two got into
an altercation, right?

748
01:21:44,905 --> 01:21:46,173
Small town.
People talk.

749
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:51,579
Did you kill him?

750
01:21:54,081 --> 01:21:55,282
You're real direct.

751
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:56,483
Uh-huh.

752
01:21:57,819 --> 01:21:59,086
No...

753
01:21:59,888 --> 01:22:01,623
but I wish I did.

754
01:22:02,791 --> 01:22:03,825
Pretty direct yourself.

755
01:22:03,957 --> 01:22:04,992
I'm just honest.

756
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,028
Understandably,
I can't take you at your word.

757
01:22:09,329 --> 01:22:13,367
I-- I get why you're asking,
but it wasn't me.

758
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,569
Hmm.

759
01:22:17,037 --> 01:22:19,206
Okay.
Well, thank you for your time.

760
01:22:21,241 --> 01:22:23,444
-That's it?
-That's it.

761
01:22:40,595 --> 01:22:41,696
I'm finished here.

762
01:22:43,865 --> 01:22:45,265
Put a black and white on him.

763
01:22:48,168 --> 01:22:49,970
I think so.
We'll see.

764
01:23:41,556 --> 01:23:42,757
The witness
was driving-by

765
01:23:42,891 --> 01:23:44,091
the night of the murder.

766
01:23:44,792 --> 01:23:47,529
Said she saw a car parked off
to the side of the road.

767
01:23:47,662 --> 01:23:49,029
Mm-hmm.

768
01:23:51,331 --> 01:23:52,800
Here's the fun part.

769
01:23:54,201 --> 01:23:56,336
She also saw a man
standing there alone.

770
01:24:21,863 --> 01:24:23,698
And you're confident
about the timeline?

771
01:24:25,867 --> 01:24:26,868
We'll see.

772
01:26:31,258 --> 01:26:32,894
We've ran
the apartment for prints.

773
01:26:34,996 --> 01:26:36,864
Oh!

774
01:26:38,966 --> 01:26:41,234
Let me guess, you found mine.

775
01:26:42,202 --> 01:26:43,470
We did.

776
01:26:44,204 --> 01:26:45,540
Yeah, I was there...

777
01:26:46,841 --> 01:26:47,942
a few nights ago.

778
01:26:51,079 --> 01:26:52,547
I just baptized him.

779
01:26:53,047 --> 01:26:54,082
He...

780
01:26:54,682 --> 01:26:56,918
wanted to show me
his place and we talked.

781
01:27:00,021 --> 01:27:01,288
Okay.

782
01:27:02,489 --> 01:27:03,758
Here's the thing.

783
01:27:06,493 --> 01:27:09,197
A dozen people saw

784
01:27:09,329 --> 01:27:11,264
Samuel threaten Troy
at a bar

785
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:12,734
a few nights
before he died.

786
01:27:13,601 --> 01:27:16,369
And his girlfriend said
that he had followed him

787
01:27:16,503 --> 01:27:18,005
a few nights in a row...

788
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:23,644
and that she gave him a knife
to use in self defense.

789
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:28,750
What do you
want me to say, Maureen?

790
01:27:29,584 --> 01:27:30,952
I want you to say
that you didn't know

791
01:27:31,085 --> 01:27:32,920
that your-- your son was
antagonizing the man

792
01:27:33,054 --> 01:27:34,287
that killed your wife.

793
01:27:34,421 --> 01:27:35,656
I want you
to tell me that you--

794
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:37,592
you didn't know
that he threatened him.

795
01:27:37,725 --> 01:27:39,292
I want you to tell me that
you didn't know any of this.

796
01:27:39,426 --> 01:27:41,361
That's what I want you to tell.
Can you tell me?

797
01:27:42,096 --> 01:27:43,363
Tell me!

798
01:27:48,603 --> 01:27:52,372
I hired Troy
'cause I wanted to watch him.

799
01:27:54,075 --> 01:27:56,376
Yeah, well,
I-- I was suspicious.

800
01:27:56,511 --> 01:27:57,812
Maybe I was afraid...

801
01:28:01,983 --> 01:28:03,518
when he asked
for a job, I thought,

802
01:28:03,651 --> 01:28:05,119
"Hey, this is an opportunity."

803
01:28:05,253 --> 01:28:06,721
An opportunity for what?

804
01:28:06,854 --> 01:28:08,990
An opportunity to--
to-- to see if I was wrong

805
01:28:09,123 --> 01:28:10,390
about him five years ago.

806
01:28:10,525 --> 01:28:12,325
See if I-- if I gave him
a second chance,

807
01:28:12,459 --> 01:28:13,961
I could say,
"See, he didn't want it."

808
01:28:17,732 --> 01:28:19,834
Were you wrong about it?

809
01:28:27,141 --> 01:28:28,576
What happened, Marshall?

810
01:28:33,080 --> 01:28:34,849
This case
is gonna go to trial.

811
01:28:36,551 --> 01:28:37,819
No, it won't.

812
01:28:39,153 --> 01:28:40,420
I'm gonna plead guilty.

813
01:28:43,658 --> 01:28:46,727
And the judge
will sentence you right there.

814
01:28:47,494 --> 01:28:48,963
This is premeditated murder.

815
01:28:50,298 --> 01:28:51,566
30 years to life.

816
01:28:53,801 --> 01:28:55,435
You will never
see daylight again.

817
01:28:57,638 --> 01:28:59,941
-I know all this.
-So why are you doing it?

818
01:29:08,983 --> 01:29:10,518
If there is
reasonable doubt about you,

819
01:29:10,651 --> 01:29:13,688
if the judge thinks
that in any way

820
01:29:13,821 --> 01:29:15,656
you are
covering for Samuel...

821
01:29:16,591 --> 01:29:17,892
he will stay the conviction...

822
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:21,662
the investigation
will continue

823
01:29:21,796 --> 01:29:24,232
and I will have to go
after your son.

824
01:29:24,364 --> 01:29:25,633
Do you understand me?

825
01:29:34,909 --> 01:29:36,510
Okay.
So that's how it is?

826
01:29:39,547 --> 01:29:40,815
Yeah. I guess.

827
01:29:48,823 --> 01:29:50,091
I'm sorry, Marshall.

828
01:29:55,296 --> 01:29:56,564
I am too.

829
01:29:59,267 --> 01:30:00,534
I am too.

830
01:30:35,269 --> 01:30:36,337
What are you doing?

831
01:30:37,872 --> 01:30:39,573
He wanted this to happen.

832
01:30:41,609 --> 01:30:43,678
I told you,
he is a murderer.

833
01:30:43,811 --> 01:30:45,413
He is nothing
but a murderer.

834
01:30:45,546 --> 01:30:47,682
How do-- how do you expect
someone like that to change?

835
01:30:50,551 --> 01:30:52,653
Because sometimes
even a murderer...

836
01:30:53,821 --> 01:30:55,156
needs a little grace.

837
01:30:57,792 --> 01:30:59,660
I won't let you ruin your life.

838
01:31:00,795 --> 01:31:02,430
Dad, Dad, don't do this.

839
01:31:02,563 --> 01:31:04,198
No, I've made my decision.
The arraignment is tomorrow.

840
01:31:04,332 --> 01:31:05,465
-I won't fight it.
-Dad-- dad, listen-- listen.

841
01:31:05,599 --> 01:31:07,268
I'm done.

842
01:31:14,275 --> 01:31:15,676
Okay, Marshall.

843
01:31:16,978 --> 01:31:18,212
Sorry kid.

844
01:31:57,752 --> 01:31:59,120
You looking for something?

845
01:32:02,690 --> 01:32:03,958
Hello, Samuel.

846
01:32:06,761 --> 01:32:08,195
How's it going?

847
01:32:10,431 --> 01:32:11,699
Nice church.

848
01:32:13,567 --> 01:32:14,835
I guess so.

849
01:32:17,938 --> 01:32:19,640
My folks raised me Catholic.

850
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:24,211
I sat in pew every Sunday
until I made confirmation.

851
01:32:25,846 --> 01:32:28,182
It was the first thing to go
when I went to college.

852
01:32:30,051 --> 01:32:32,253
"A lapsed Catholic
is a good Catholic,"

853
01:32:32,386 --> 01:32:33,654
or so they say.

854
01:32:38,659 --> 01:32:40,294
A month after my mom died,
I went back.

855
01:32:40,428 --> 01:32:43,064
It was the first time
I had been there in decades.

856
01:32:43,197 --> 01:32:45,032
Mm, I sat there
trying to figure out

857
01:32:45,166 --> 01:32:46,700
if I did it
'cause of faith...

858
01:32:49,303 --> 01:32:51,305
if I just wanted
to feel her again.

859
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:54,675
-Did it work?
-Huh!

860
01:32:57,745 --> 01:32:59,847
We're all alone, Samuel.

861
01:33:02,616 --> 01:33:03,918
Do you think he did it?

862
01:33:07,988 --> 01:33:09,857
My dad's
never lied to me before.

863
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:13,828
There's always a first time.

864
01:33:17,298 --> 01:33:18,866
Is that why you're here?

865
01:33:21,802 --> 01:33:23,871
I'm understandably
confused...

866
01:33:24,505 --> 01:33:25,773
how-- how--

867
01:33:28,309 --> 01:33:31,378
how a man
who worked so hard...

868
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:34,882
to forgive the man
that killed his wife...

869
01:33:36,585 --> 01:33:38,385
who welcomed him
into the church...

870
01:33:40,688 --> 01:33:42,056
and by all accounts...

871
01:33:43,558 --> 01:33:45,092
tried to save his soul...

872
01:33:47,628 --> 01:33:48,896
would suddenly kill him.

873
01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:57,638
You have to ask him.

874
01:33:59,640 --> 01:34:00,908
I did.

875
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:04,712
I didn't believe
the lie he told me.

876
01:34:11,352 --> 01:34:14,221
If you know something
different than what he said...

877
01:34:15,122 --> 01:34:17,825
it is your moral obligation
to do something.

878
01:34:22,196 --> 01:34:23,264
He loves you...

879
01:34:24,599 --> 01:34:26,000
you know that.

880
01:34:27,602 --> 01:34:28,869
A lot.

881
01:34:32,039 --> 01:34:33,407
He's being
arraigned tomorrow.

882
01:34:37,378 --> 01:34:38,712
I, uh...

883
01:34:40,681 --> 01:34:41,650
I wanted you to know.

884
01:39:17,224 --> 01:39:21,028
<i>♪ Amazing grace ♪</i>

885
01:39:21,161 --> 01:39:24,933

886
01:39:25,065 --> 01:39:26,133

01:39:41,348 --> 01:39:46,253
