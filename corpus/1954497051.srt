1
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:14,706
              What's wrong?

2
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,608
             What?
               Why are you
               so quiet?

3
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,676
          No reason.

4
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:20,612
                   You nervous?

5
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,714
          Hell no.

6
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:25,217
     I'm just thinking...
     What if, uh...

7
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:28,754
   ...this Huffman fucker
   shows up traveling light?

8
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:31,657
                I don't know...
                How light?

9
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:32,825
       I don't know,
       let's say half.

10
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,395
              Half, I think
              that buys him
              about a day.

11
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:40,632
     Nothing more than that,
     but we're not blackmailing
     this guy in installments.

12
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,535
 What if he shows up
 with 50 or 60 grand?

13
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,370
              That's just
              an insult.

14
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,740
             Anything less
             than 100,000,

15
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,710
           so this guy knows
           we mean business.

16
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,780
        Did you bring
        the bleach?
        'Cause I didn't.

17
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,255
             There's nothing
             to worry about,
             this guy's scared.

18
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:05,324
              He wouldn't dare
              try and stiff us.

19
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:09,461
      Yeah, he wouldn't
      'cause we're no
      dumb-ass custodians.

20
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,331
         Oh, shit,
         there he is.

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,566

22
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:16,902
                   We're on.

23
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,472
 Uh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

24
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,148
 I, uh, came alone
 like you said.

25
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,183
           Smart man.

26
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,551

          the green.

27
00:02:33,286 --> 00:02:34,353
          Oh.

28
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,263
    And my DVDs?

29
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,665
                   Right here,
                   Fellini.

30
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,637
    Toss us the bag,
    and you can take your
    dirty movies and go.

 it was a small accident.

92
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,612
 I had one drink,

 Seriously, who...
 How did he get
 this job, huh?

97
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:13,124
Did you fuck him?

98
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,594

99
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:18,063
        You know what my father
        used to tell me?

100
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,631
           "Trust in the Lord
           with all your heart,

101
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:21,633
          "and lean not on your
          own understanding."

102
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:26,972

              But now, somehow,

105
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,912

       for bringing you on.

106
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,715
           Now, I gotta rethink
           the whole fucking
           plan, dickhead!

107
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:42,587
         Right here, right now,
         this is what
         we're fucking doing.

108
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,925
                 We need to get
                 to the bank
                 at 5:00 p.m.,

109
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,094

               it closes, okay?

110
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,267
The plan worked
          just like I told you.

111
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,104
                       Hold it.

00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:29,788
              It went fucking
              perfect, perfect.

138
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,922
            Just like you said.

139
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,928
Okay, that's perfect.

140
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,063
 Did anyone
 follow you?

141
00:11:38,065 --> 00:11:40,331
             No, no,
             they all got shot.

142
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,000
 Everybody got shot.

143
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:44,002
     They shot Ray first.

144
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:46,104
 I don't know if he's dead,
 I don't know if he's alive.

145
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:51,876
      Baby, there's a million
      fucking dollars in there.

146
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,712
 Oh...

147
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:54,846
                    Can we just
                    fucking go?

148
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:55,980
           You gotta take me
           to a hospital, okay?

149
00:11:55,982 --> 00:11:57,415
              My arm is fucking
              killing me...

150
00:11:57,417 --> 00:11:59,951
 Baby, we just stole
 a million dollars.

151
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,887
 Your arm is the least
 of our problems, okay?

152
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,122
 This is amazing.

153
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:06,091
   We should go,
   we should go.

154
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,393
   We should go,
   we should go.

155
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,329
                  Oh, fuck.
      Are you fucking
      kidding me?

156
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:12,430
               Oh, no.

157
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:19,104
                  Oh, fuck.

158
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:21,039
                  I ask you to
                  do one thing,

159
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,373
           one fucking thing...

160
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,408
               Don't let anyone
               follow you back.

161
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,477
             Sorry, I... Shit.

162
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,011
 I can't go to prison.

163
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,483
   I can't go to prison...
   I can't...

164
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,319
Bev...

165
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:35,386
      Oh!

166
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,857
    Oh... Oh.

167
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:40,892
I...

168
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,932
          I can't go to prison.

169
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:54,105
                 Why did you...
                 Why did you do
                 that, Beverly?

170
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:56,474
                   I'm sorry.

171
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,244
                         Oh!
                  Don't be mad!

172
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,923
<i> You know, I was hoping</i>
     <i> for some kind of</i>

173
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,526
  <i> cool white</i>
  <i> flash-before-my-eyes montage</i>

174
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:17,195
   <i> or a reassuring light</i>
   <i> at the end of the tunnel.</i>

175
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,297
           <i> Instead, I found</i>
           <i> the TV remote.</i>

176
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,201
   <i> I don't know if it was</i>
   <i> because my wife betrayed me</i>

177
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:26,004
<i> or because I was about to lose</i>
<i> a million dollars,</i>

178
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:29,307
    <i> but whatever it was,</i>
    <i> something came over me.</i>

180

Hey, buddy.

                    Hey, buddy?

182
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,316
                   Holy shit.

183
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,119
           Jesus Christ.

184
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,023
<i> LA Police Department,</i>
   <i> how can I help you?</i>

185
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,959
            Hey, hey, hey,
            there's a guy,
            he's on the street.

186
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,895
             He's bleeding...
             I think he's dead.

187
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,229
       Fuck, I think he's dead.

188
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,570
May the Lord
              in His kindness,

189
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,338
            and His wisdom,
            and His generosity,

190
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,208
             and His love,
             and His caring,
             and His full heart

191
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:14,479
       accept you into Heaven
       as you leave this earth.

192
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:18,082
- What are you...
- What are you doing?

193
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:22,320
 This is Father Matthews,
 he's giving you
 your last rites.

194
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,621
           I'm dying?

195
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,323
 I'm afraid so.

196
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:27,392
 You suffered a gunshot
 wound to the spleen,

197
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:31,329
 causing internal
 bleeding and severe
 renal failure.

198
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:34,632
 I called a priest in
 because you only have
 a few minutes to live.

199
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,035
              Before you
              can enter heaven,

200
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:39,404
          before you
          receive the sacrament
          of penance,

201
00:15:39,406 --> 00:15:41,639
              you must unburden
              yourself of sin.

202
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:44,275
                 You must tell
                 God where you
                 hid the money.

203
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,045
                Otherwise, how
                can you ascend?

204
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:55,286
           I'm dying?

205
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,959
 It's a cute act,
 but I get it.

206
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:02,360
       You boys are the heat.

207
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,631
 Detective Ashton.

208
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,666
 This is
 Detective Morton,
 my partner.

209
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:11,002
    The <i> Playhouse 90</i> routine,
    that was my idea.

210
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,203
          Detective Ashton
          here just wanted

211
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:13,471
           to kick your ass
           until you talked.

212
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,407
         Talk about what?

213
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:18,710
               Your buddy...
               He made a deal
               and gave you up.

214
00:16:18,712 --> 00:16:21,546
 So we have
 you for receiving
 stolen goods.

215
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:24,248
 You're going
 away for three
 years for that.

216
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,751
 However, today
 is your lucky day

217
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,619
 'cause if you tell us
 where the money is,

218
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:30,321
 you walk
 out of here
 free and clear.

219
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,358
       Well, 'cause that...
       That sounds like

220
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,994
       an official,
       city-backed offer.

221
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,664
         I'm sorry, boys.

222
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,999
         Money burned up
         in the fire.

223
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,202
              Come on...
              A loser like you?

224
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:46,537
             You'd burn alive
             before you left
             that money behind.

225
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,108
             Look.

226
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,643
 We know that you
 went to the Jefferson
 Hotel, all right?

227
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,245
 We know that you used
 your master key

228
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,147
 to get into
 one of the rooms.

229
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,150
      And we know that
      you stole some clothes

230
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,786
       from a Japanese
       tourist...
       Remember this?

231
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,755
 You made a huge
 fucking mess.

232
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,690
 Look, we know that's
 where you hid the money,

233
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,559
           and when we find it,
           it's 10 to 15 years.

234
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,662
                    Do yourself
                    a favor.

235
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:14,032
             Give us the money,
             all right?

236
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,467
 A face like
 that in prison?

237
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,703
                 You're gonna
                 be eating dick
                 by lunchtime.

238
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,772
 Dick that's
 been in your ass.

239
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,675
 Money burned up
 in the fire.

240
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:27,045
 All right, fuck it,
 we do it my way.

241
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:29,213
 Morton, start
 writing on his chart.

242
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:31,716
            Besides the gunshot
            wound and
            the broken arm,

243
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:35,753
           he suffers from
           severe hematomas and
           a shattered kneecap.

244
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:39,290
              Hematomas...
              How do you spell
              "hematomas"?

245
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:42,326
            H-E...
               I'm just gonna
               put "bruising."

246
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,395
   You're not gonna torture me,
   you guys are cops.

247
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:46,731
   We don't use that word.

248
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,533
   That's an ugly word.
             Yes, ugly.

249
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:50,802
    I just need to make
    sure you don't know
    where the money is.

250
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,637
    Oh, come on.

251
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,272
 Hey, hey, hey, I...

252
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:55,339
         Oh!

253
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,227
               <i> ¶</i>

254
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:49,327
     Hmm.

255
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,467
     Ethan Tell.

256
00:18:57,237 --> 00:19:01,305
  I'll be your
  parole officer for
  the next 18 months

257
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,141
 unless, of course,
 you do something stupid

258
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,709
   and find yourself
   back in here.

259
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,478
   Not a good move.

260
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,280
 Here are your
 parole instructions.

261
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,715
   In a nutshell,
   don't leave LA.

262
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:13,451
  Don't hang out
  with any felons,
  any convicts,

263
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:16,354
 or anyone who has
 access to a firearm.

264
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:21,926
 Say that you just
 found God on your...
 Your release

265
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:24,295
 and your pastor
 wants to invite you
 over for dinner

266
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:26,397
 to meet his gorgeous
 virgin daughter,

267
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:29,333
 who has big titties
 and big nipples.

268
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,436
 Well, say you're at dinner,
 and there's a Civil War rifle

269
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,739
 that hasn't been shot
 in a hundred years,

270
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,441
 right over dinner,
 right over the potato salad.

271
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,577
 I suggest you get
 the fuck out of there

272
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:41,179
 and stay away from
 that man, his church,

273
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,214
   his daughter,
   and her big nipples

274
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:45,183
 because they're trying
 to throw you back in jail.

275
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,517
 That's a violation.

276
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,953
 Here's your keys
 to the halfway house.

277
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,522
 It's a residential facility,
 not a jail cell,

278
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,591
 so there's no fucking
 in the shower,

279
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:54,725
 there's no peeing
 in the sink.

280
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,361
 All the stuff
 you do in here? Mmm-mmm.

281
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,930
 It's a nice place,
 keep it clean.

282
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,198
   Are we clear?

283
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
                     Yeah.

284
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,368
 I'll see you every Tuesday,
 10:30 sharp,

285
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,836
 no exceptions,
 no excuses.

286
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:06,904
                   No bullshit.

287
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,373
   See? I like you.

288
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,476
 Pick a candy...
 Not the purple ones,
 I love those.

289
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:13,844
 And don't do
 anything stupid.

290
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,684
 All right, they wanna
 know where you stash
 your cash at.

291
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:22,920
 Don't try to skip town,
 make a run for it.

292
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,889
 You won't
 get half a block

293
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,358
 with every cop
 in the city...

294
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,759
 ...watching you.

295
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,995
   So if I were you,
   play it cool,

296
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,564
       and tomorrow...

297
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,399
     I'll help you.

298
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:37,969
                  Help me what?

299
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,339
      Get the cash.

300
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:44,709
               Mr. Johnson, uh,
               the cash burned
               up in the fire.

301
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,646
   I like that,
   keep it like that.

302
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,917
 Convict on deck!

303
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:54,619
                       Parolee.
        Yeah.

304
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,007
Tell?

305
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:20,411
                          Tell!

306
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,714
    I'm unarmed.

307
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,323
   You look good.

308
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:36,027
 Sorry I never came
 to visit you in prison.

309
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,064
    I wrote to
    you, though.
                     Yeah.

310
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:42,566
           Divorce letter?
           I... I got that one.

311
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:45,703
    That was just so
    they wouldn't think
    I was an accomplice.

312
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:47,305
                   Smart.

313
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,572
 You know, I, uh...

314
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,941
      I wrote you letters.

315
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,910
 I was kind of hoping
 that when you got out,

316
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,912
 some time would
 pass, and then

317
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:56,681
 maybe you'd be able
 to forgive me?

318
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:57,748
                   For what,
                   shooting me

319
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,550
                or not visiting
                me in prison?

320
00:22:01,386 --> 00:22:02,887
    Both, actually.

321
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,362
        Can I give
        you a ride?

322
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:13,998
      We can talk,
      catch up maybe.

323
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:17,068
         It's good
         seeing you, Bev.

324
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,572
               It was always
               just you and me.

325
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:23,641
             Just one cup
             of coffee, please.

326
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,089
  You know, it's gonna
  take more than a couple
  of donuts, Bev.

327
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,026
             When I shot you,
             I was off my ass.

328
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,395
        Like, clean off my ass.

329
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:45,563
       What does
       that mean?

330
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,733
             All those promises
             you made,

331
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:50,901
             how you were gonna
             take care of me,
             I believed them,

332
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:53,904
            every single
            one of them because
            I loved you.

333
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:56,107
                And all of that
                drove me...

334
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:58,409
     Just clean
     off your ass.

335
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:01,779
           And then, the police
           showed up,
           and I panicked.

336
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:04,615
               But everything's
               different now.

337
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,718
               I mean,
               I have changed,
               and you're rich.

338
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:09,754
   Excuse me?

339
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:11,922
                   What?

340
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,558
           Oh, your bank money.

341
00:23:15,827 --> 00:23:18,062
 Ours,
 if you still love me,

342
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,764
 which I don't...

343
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:23,134
             Money burned up
             at the house, Bev,
             it's not there.

344
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,502
                  Money's gone.

345
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,805
          Do you still love me?

346
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:29,974
         Hmm?
              Of course
              I still love you.

347
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:32,042
            Hmm.

348
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:34,845
           If there's no money,
           then there's
           no money, babe.

349
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:36,947
            We have each other.

350
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,016
                 I love you.

351
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,924
                Is there really
                no money?

352
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,761
Sorry.

353
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,634
               So this morning,
               when I was
               getting ready,

354
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:58,836
              I realized that
              you and I haven't
              seen each other

355
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:00,604
               for three years.

356
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:02,940
              So I only
              wore this.

357
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,445
   But I mean,
   you probably don't
   want me, do you?

358
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,948
                   Mm.
              How do you like
              them donuts, huh?

359
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,957
          I lied to you earlier
          about being armed.

360
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:22,793
   That surprises me.

361
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,095
                     Relax.

362
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:29,033
                 It's for you.

363
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:32,136
    What the hell
    am I supposed
    to do with this?

364
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,871
                  Ray's getting
                  out of prison
                  this week.

365
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,574
       No, Ray got
       7 to 10.

366
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:38,609
              No, they're
              letting him out
              on good behavior.

367
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:39,877
                    You know
                    why, right?

368
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,245
              The police are
              gonna let him out

369
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:42,913
            just to see
            if he can lead them
            to the money.

370
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,682
          Ray's gonna kill you,

371
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:48,752
 So you're giving
 me a gun to kill
 your brother?

372
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:51,155
                 No, to protect
                 yourself.

373
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,257
               Jesus.

374
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:54,758
          I'm just gonna
          get dressed.

375
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,026
            I wanna
            show you something.

376
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,671
What's this place?

377
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,573
             See that house?

378
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:11,876
           That's where I live.

379
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,981
             When I shot you,
             I didn't know
             at the time, Tell,

380
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:20,584
           that I was
           carrying your child.

381
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,820
           Wait, what?

382
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:24,555
               I wanted to
               tell you, I did.

383
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:25,756
             That's why I wrote
             all those letters.

384
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:28,559
          I wanted to tell you,
          I just... Couldn't.

385
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:30,561
          Please don't hate me.
     Bev, we have a kid?

386
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:32,796
          He's a beautiful boy.

387
00:25:32,964 --> 00:25:34,198
          Oh.

388
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,166
               I couldn't raise
               him by myself

389
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:40,170
          I mean, I was alone,
          I was pregnant,
          I was broke.

390
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:43,641
                The only reason
                I divorced you
                was because

391
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:46,277
           I needed to marry
           another man so
           he could support me.

392
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,611
       Wait, what?

393
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,848
     You're married?

394
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,850
             I met Arthur
             through my cousin.

395
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:54,018
            He's quite amazing,
            actually.

396
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,753
               He takes really
               good care of us.

397
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:59,189
 You're married, you live
 in that house with some guy

398
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,725
 and my kid, and
 he calls him "Daddy"?

399
00:26:02,694 --> 00:26:04,795
            Only while you were
            in prison.

400
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:06,130
        Now that you're out
        and you have the money,

401
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:08,032
             I will divorce him
             and marry you,

402
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:10,601
        and we can be together,
        and be a family, and...

403
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:15,873
   You're off your ass.

404
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,741
           Where are you going?

405
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:19,977
           To get my son
           away from you
           and your crazy.

406
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:21,946
  No, no, no,
  you can't do that.

407
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:23,247
 Just give me the gun,
 you have to
 get out of here.

408
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,649
              Let me go.
 Just come with me,
 just come...

409
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:27,785
I'm not leaving
          without my kid.

410
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:30,821
              Shit.

411
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:32,656
             What did
             you do?

412
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,825
            Okay, you have
            to get out of here.

413
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,260
              Just go, just go,
              just go.

414
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,329
             Do you wanna
             go back to prison?

415
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,700
Wait! Tell!

416
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,338
   Really?
              You need that.

417
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,096
        Good morning,
        gentlemen.

418
00:27:46,365 --> 00:27:49,667
     Anyone interested
     in an honest
     day's pay?

419
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,369
            Tax free.

420
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,072
            Next time.

421
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:22,433
               Here we are,
               home sweet home.

422
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:24,968
 Father Frank and I live
 in the parish house,

423
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:27,371
              and we rented out
              the apartment

424
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:30,074
         to the church
         custodian for the last
         couple of years.

425
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,975
             But now, it needs
             to be emptied out.

426
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:33,911
 Oh, he's not
 living here anymore?

427
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:37,081
              No, he...
              It was a suicide.

428
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:45,989
                Nice.

429
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,195
               So you want
               this whole place
               cleaned up?

430
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:54,198
 Yes, indeed, clean,
 clean, clean.

431
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,400
             The man
             committed suicide.

432
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:59,069
         That's a sin in
         the eyes of the church
         and the Lord.

433
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,004
 So everything has
 to go, everything.

434
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:04,508
 We can't keep it,
 we can't donate it.

435
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,343
  Everything's gotta go.

436
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,114
   Look, it's not
   a dream job.

437
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:11,915
 It's more of a nightmare.

438
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:16,120
 But... Look it here,
 the keys!

439
00:29:16,122 --> 00:29:19,423
 To the pickup, you said
 how cool it was, so...

440
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,225
 ...you can haul
 everything away on that...

441
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:24,027
 And, uh, this could
 be the beginning

442
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,496
 of you turning
 your life around.

443
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:34,505
               <i> ¶</i>

444
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,873
   Hi.
                      Shit.

445
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:46,577
 Jesus Christ,
 you don't show up
 at somebody's house.

446
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:49,246
                 Bev, I brought
                 this for him.

447
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:51,949
 So what?
 What the hell is
 wrong with you?

448
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:53,517
              Come on.

449
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,485
        God, what would you
        have done if my husband
        answered the door?

450
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,855
 I don't know,
 "Hi, I'm Tell,
 I'm her other husband."

451
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:00,123
 You stupid idiot...
 Get in the car, drive!

452
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,959
   Go! Get in the car!
                   Shh.

453
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:04,595
                Hurry!

454
00:31:04,597 --> 00:31:07,531
          Okay, if I had a son,
          I wanna see him.

455
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:09,967
   Well, you can't
   see him.

456
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:11,201
                  You told me
                  you loved me.

457
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:16,874
 Jesus, Tell,
 that was before
 I knew you were broke.

458
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:19,276
   I am not gonna
   leave my husband

459
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:21,445
   if you don't
   have the money.

460
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,915
                 Wait a minute.

461
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,619
         So you're gonna
         dangle our son as bait

462
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:31,555
            because you think
            I'm lying about
            having "the money."

463
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:35,025
   And you're here
   just to make sure
   he looks like you.

464
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:36,193
        Am I right?

465
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,100
            Okay, I'm gonna
            be honest with you.

466
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:47,271
       No shit.
        I had the money when
        I got out of the house.

467
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:49,573
           But when I was
           looking for
           a place to stash it,

468
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,475
                I passed out
                on the street
                from blood loss

469
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:53,977
                because someone
                shot me.

470
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,179
           Then, when I woke up
           in the hospital...

471
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:57,614
Money was gone.

472
00:32:00,118 --> 00:32:01,218
          Hmm.

473
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:03,987
                   Your turn.

474
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:06,957
       Okay, okay.

475
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:11,962
 His name is William,
 after your father

476
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:13,430
 because is he your son.

477
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,332
 And yes, I love you,

478
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:16,566
   and I want us
   to be a family.

479
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,402
     I really do.

480
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:21,939
   But if you can't
   support William,

481
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:24,041
   then I have to be
   with someone who can.

482
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:26,543
 It's just
 smart parenting.

483
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:30,347
 Please don't
 come back here,
 for William's sake.

484
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:32,082
   Oh, this was
   very thoughtful.

485
00:32:32,084 --> 00:32:33,517
Oh...

486
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,093
  <i> ¶ It's spun out of control</i>

515
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,549
           You know what?

516
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:53,683
       I think
       that you boys need

517
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,852
        to take a refresher
        on surveillance.

518
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,420
               We figured there
               was no harm
               coming in here,

519
00:35:57,422 --> 00:36:01,224
           It's cold outside...
           Don't worry,
           relax, relax.

520
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:02,459
             All right,
             we're not here to
             cause any trouble.

521
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:03,627
 We don't even care
 about the rod

522
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:07,597
 Or the fact that
 you used it to shoot up
 a neighborhood.

523
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,798
                Or that you
                were giving it
                to your ex-wife

524
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,933
                   in a public
                   parking lot.

525
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:12,402
           That's against
           the law, by the way.

526
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,539
 What do you say
 to a friendly drink?

527
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:18,175
                  Hey, can we
                  get two shots
                  of whiskey,

528
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:20,777
                   and whatever
                   my friend
                   is having?

529
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:26,349
        Look, guys,
        just like I said
        three years ago,

530
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:29,819
      the money...
      Burned up in the fire,
      so excuse me.

531
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:34,591
            Get up, get up.

532
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:35,959
           Get up, get up,
           get up.

533
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,594
               God.

534
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:39,629
   There you go.
            Do not bleed on me.

535
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:42,799
                  There you go,
                  there you go.

536
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,304
   You know
   what I think?

537
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:49,739
 I think we got off
 to a bad start.

538
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,243
   Shh, shh,
   shh, shh, shh.

539
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:55,645
   Don't give me
   some lame-ass excuse.

540
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:57,247
   I don't even think
   you have the money.

541
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:01,785
   But Morton here,
   he's unsure.

542
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:04,387
              So we're gonna
              stick around just
              to make sure.

543
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:11,261
 So why don't you,
 uh, just skip the part

544
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:12,829
  where you mouth off

545
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:16,499
   and just politely
   deal with our
   harassment, okay?

546
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,302
             Hmm.

547
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,671
  Look how much
  nicer he looks with
  his mouth shut, huh?

548
00:37:26,477 --> 00:37:29,546
      I'm so glad
      I got that off
      of my chest.

549
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:30,680
   I feel better already.

550
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:31,982
                   I'm so proud
                   of you.

551
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:37,654
              Cheers to
              old acquaintances
              reunited.

552
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:42,959
 And making amends.

553
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:50,867
         Hit us.

554
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:04,414
Well...

555
00:38:15,326 --> 00:38:16,893
   Where... Where am I?

556
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,763
          Your room
          at the halfway house,
          on the floor.

557
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:22,699
             Those detectives
             dropped you off
             about an hour ago.

558
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:24,401
                Those guys just
                beat you enough
                to put you

559
00:38:24,403 --> 00:38:27,070
          out of commission
          for the night,
          so we gotta talk now.

560
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,540
 They should have
 dropped me in the bed.

561
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:34,544
     I got something
     for that, cowboy, come on.

562
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:38,014
                    Okay, okay.

563
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,720
 You know,
 they're gonna come back

564
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:45,455
 night after night
 until you give in,

565
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:48,091
   or your ex-partner's
   gonna kill you.

566
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:50,427
        Let me guess...
        You're gonna give me...

567
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:51,995
             ...look behind
             door number three.

568
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:55,665
 We go with my plan...
 It's simple and easy.

569
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,334
 You tell me where
 the money is,

570
00:38:57,336 --> 00:39:00,603
 I go get it,
 we split it, <i> arrivederci.</i>

571
00:39:00,605 --> 00:39:02,005
             Look, I passed out

572
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:03,973
             in the middle
             of the street
             from blood loss,

573
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:06,042
            and when I woke up
            in the hospital,
            the money was gone.

574
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:07,877
 So it didn't burn up
 in this fucking

575
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,979
 miraculous fire you
 keep telling me about?

576
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,751
   See? I knew
   your ass was lying.

577
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:17,020
 When you came in
 with that fire bullshit,

578
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,755
 I was, like,
 "This motherfucker lying."

579
00:39:18,757 --> 00:39:21,424
 But now we on the same team,
 it's... We're building trust.

580
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,661
 We'll talk about it
 at your weekly.

581
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:28,098
 But until then,
 I need you to stay low.
               Yeah.

582
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,768
 And look, I'm gonna
 leave a little edge
 under your pillow.

583
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:35,638
    A little edge
    under the pillow.

584
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,773
                       Okay.

585
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:48,852
               <i> ¶</i>

586
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,147
                   Soccer.

587
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:20,150
                    Eurotrash.

588
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,506
            Hi.

589
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:19,576
Ray?

590
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:22,779
 Where's my money, Tell?

591
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,948
          Oh, you can just
          cut me out of here,
          and we can talk.

592
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,851
        Ah.

593
00:41:27,853 --> 00:41:29,118
   Where's my money?

594
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,788
           Um, I don't have it.

595
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,691
               Okay?
               I don't have it.

596
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:36,626
              Someone stole it
              when I passed out
              on the street.

597
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:37,794
                 I'm sorry,
                 it's gone.

598
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,765
                     Uh... Ray.

599
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:44,734
Where... Where is it...

600
00:41:44,736 --> 00:41:46,636
 Where... Where is it,
 though, seriously?

601
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:48,638
           Don't...
           Don't do this, okay?

602
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,240
              The money's gone.
           Yeah.

603
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:53,910
 You're fucking
 lying, Tell.

604
00:41:53,912 --> 00:41:56,579
 You... You don't
 have the money, okay?

605
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:57,914
          Oh!
       Fuck you!

606
00:41:57,916 --> 00:41:59,949
               Damn it, okay...
   You fucking liar!

607
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:02,752
   You fucking left me
   to die there!

608
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:04,787
   That was our fucking plan!
           It doesn't matter...

609
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,656
 And you left me
 to fucking die there!

610
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,925
              I found the safe.
 You... You found the safe?

611
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:10,793
          Yes, you can take it,
          it's all yours.

612
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,262
   You want me to do
   fucking back flips?

613
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:15,665
   Tell, I'm gonna
   fucking plunge this thing.

614
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:16,799
              Okay, okay, okay.
   I'm gonna
   fucking plunge it.

615
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,001
              Ray, do not
              plunge that, Ray!

616
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:20,603
       Okay, okay?
       Bye-bye, Tell.

617
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:21,771
 Please don't
 plunge it, Ray.

618
00:42:21,773 --> 00:42:22,939
       Ray, Ray!
                      Fuck you!

619
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:25,041
                   Oh, God!

620
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,310
               Why? I told you
               the truth, okay.

621
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:29,546
            Why would you
            do this, all right?
            I passed out!

622
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:31,948
 You've got
 10 seconds to live...
 Where's my goddamn money?

623
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,950
             I told you I don't
             have the money!

624
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:35,885
           I passed out on the
           street, it was gone!

625
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:36,953
                      Fuck!

626
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:39,689
               Damn it,
               Ray, you just...

627
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:41,858
          ...you just killed me
          for no reason.

628
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,693
             Why'd you do that?

629
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:44,727
     Fuck me!

630
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:57,640
     You really did
     lose the fucking
     money, didn't you?

631
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,179
     Oh, yeah.

632
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,022
        Oh, you son of a bitch!

633
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:15,925
              Oh, I really
              thought there was
              bleach in there.

634
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,660
    Ah, that's
    just water.

635
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,263
   So where's
   this fucking safe?

636
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,867
One time on
            <i> The Untouchables,</i>

637
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:27,637
              Robert Stack shot
              a wall safe open.

638
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,607
               You think
               that would work?

639
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:32,809
             Do I look like
             I even have a gun?

640
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,045
 Just saying... What if?

641
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:37,680
              I've been
              out of prison for
              a fucking day.

642
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:39,749
                 Where would
                 I get a gun?
     I don't know.

643
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:44,020
   I've been out
   for three days,
   don't look at me.

644
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,328
          It would probably
          just bend the fucking
          metal anyway.

645
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,065
            Unless you blew
            the lock clean off.

646
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:57,867
               That'd be pretty
               fucking cool.

647
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,304
             Ah, what the hell,
             it's worth a shot.

648
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,906
  Ray... I knew
  you would...

649
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:05,408
             Turn the TV volume
             all the way up.

650
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,676
               Shit.

651
00:44:09,347 --> 00:44:10,713
          Ray.

652
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:12,181
   You can't shoot...
                       Shit!

653
00:44:12,183 --> 00:44:13,950
               I didn't blow it
               clean off.

654
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:15,218
 You told me you
 didn't have a gun.

655
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,919
                 How the fuck
                 am I gonna get
                 into it now?

656
00:44:16,921 --> 00:44:18,921
  You said... Why...
  Where did you
  get the gun from?

657
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:20,189
                    Ah, fuck.

658
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:24,127
   Ray, the gun...
   Where did you
   get the gun?

659
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,663
                 Fucking Bev
                 gave it to me.

660
00:44:26,665 --> 00:44:28,064
          Oh.

661
00:44:28,066 --> 00:44:29,666
 She gave you that.

662
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:31,167
                    Yeah.
     Aw, bitch.

663
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,269
         There better be
         something good in
         here, Tell, seriously.

664
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:35,004
 Ray, it's a safe.

665
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:39,842
  You keep money,
  jewels, important
  stuff in safes!

666
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,678
                Ah! Ha, ha!

667
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,945
   Shit, that worked.

668
00:44:43,815 --> 00:44:47,417
              It's just a bunch
              of fucking
              tax papers, man.

669
00:44:48,218 --> 00:44:49,886
 What the fuck
 is this shit?

670
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:53,389
   What is that?
        Uh-buh-buh-buh-buh-bah.

671
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:55,024
           I was asking myself.

672
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:00,730
                  I'm keeping
                  this shit.
       Okay.

673
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:02,131
               Yeah, it's mine.

674
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:03,700
                 Thank you.

675
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:05,001
                Oh, oh, one...
                One more thing.

676
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:06,235
 This is for
 the bank shit.

677
00:45:06,237 --> 00:45:08,104
Oh!

678
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,743
               Shit.

679
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,428
       Jesus, Tell,
       every time
       I see you,

680
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,130
   you're bleeding
   from someplace new.

681
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,134
   What happened?

682
00:45:38,136 --> 00:45:39,402
                        Well...

683
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:41,204
                 I ran into
                 an old friend.

684
00:45:41,206 --> 00:45:45,374
               And then, I ran
               into a shovel.

685
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:46,743
             And, um...

686
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,747
       You know,
       just a normal
       day at the office.

687
00:45:52,016 --> 00:45:53,082
                 Ray?

688
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,352
 What are you doing here?

689
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,755
            I know I told you
            that we shouldn't

690
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:00,189
            see each
            other anymore,

691
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,793
            but I wanted
            to give you this.

692
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:07,764
       What's this?

693
00:46:07,766 --> 00:46:10,299
           It's a photo
           of our son, William.

694
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:13,069
                It was taken
                this Halloween.

695
00:46:13,071 --> 00:46:16,172
     Help me understand
     something, Bev.

696
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:18,241
   I'm not allowed
   to see this kid.

697
00:46:18,243 --> 00:46:21,244
 Why is it so important
 for you to prove to me
 that I'm his father?

698
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,948
                 Because...

699
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,251
             I want you to know
             that I am telling
             you the truth.

700
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:30,853
           I don't want you
           to think I would use

701
00:46:30,855 --> 00:46:33,122
            something like this
            to get the money.

702
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,191
                 I want you
                 to believe me.

703
00:46:35,193 --> 00:46:38,361
          I want you to believe
          in me, I guess.

704
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,567
               That needs to be
               cleaned better.

705
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:46,002
             Sit on the bed.

706
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,476
    Oh, hey, guess what
    Ray showed me today.

707
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,280
           A giant-ass hand
           cannon you gave him.

708
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,350
   He came to see me...

709
00:47:01,352 --> 00:47:03,019
                  Ow!

710
00:47:03,021 --> 00:47:05,154
 Right after prison...
 What was I supposed to do?

711
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:07,023
            Hey, Bev, how many
            guys have you given
            guns to this week?

712
00:47:07,025 --> 00:47:08,958
       What did you
       want me to say?

713
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,560
   "I'm sorry, Ray,
   I can't give you a gun

714
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:11,928
   "because I've already
   given Tell one

715
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:15,464
       You give him a .44
       and you give me, what,
       this little pea shooter?

716
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:17,834
 Come on, Tell,
 you've always been
 a better shot than him.

717
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:19,268
                That's beside
                the point.

718
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,003
              Beverly, don't
              think I'm stupid.

719
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:24,507
             You're trying
             to play me against
             your brother

720
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:27,310
            in hopes that
            whoever is left
            standing in the end

721
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:29,078
              shares the money
              with you.

722
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,146
                Am I right?

723
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:39,589
       and I'm not
       gonna fucking
       clean it up.

724
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,359
                    I love you.

725
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,528
                  It's good
                  seeing you.
                       You too!

726
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:13,890
        Fellas, it's about time
        you got here to help.

727
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:15,558
         I tell you what...
         Why don't you guys
         take the dresser?

728
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,260
     I'll carry up the pillows.
 I'm calling a time-out.

729
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:18,628
                    Yeah, okay.

730
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:21,297
           We're hungry,
           and we wanna get
           something to eat.

731
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:23,065
     If you don't
     mind me saying,

732
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,301
   that bitch is your
   fucking kryptonite.

733
00:48:25,303 --> 00:48:26,502
    Why don't you
    stay away from her?

734
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:28,671
       You know,
       I would if I could.

735
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:32,575
 Uh, we think
 you're gonna be
 picking up the money

736
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:34,277
 at a steak place
 over on Melrose,

737
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:36,345
 so we're gonna
 sit there,
 surveil you...

738
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:38,281
      Okay, so you're gonna get
      a free steak out of me.

739
00:48:38,283 --> 00:48:41,017
 And a couple
 bottles of wine.
 Sure.

740
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:46,055
Put your hands
 under the table.

741
00:48:46,057 --> 00:48:47,456
 I don't wanna see
 your handcuffs.

742
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:49,358
 All right, good,
 give me hunger.

743
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:51,661
     Now put your head down
     like you're

744
00:48:51,663 --> 00:48:53,329
      a little depressed,
      but not that depressed.

745
00:48:53,331 --> 00:48:54,430
         There you go.

746
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:57,566
    Ooh, yes, that's it,
    make me feel it.

747
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:58,968
       Come on, sit down.

748
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,217
      Gentlemen,
      is everything okay?

749
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:16,285
        Can I get you
        anything else?

750
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,353
                     Can I have
                     more wine?

751
00:49:17,355 --> 00:49:18,654
        Mmm-hmm, yeah.

752
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,260
               Sorry, we can't
               order you
               anything to eat.

753
00:49:24,262 --> 00:49:27,163
 Three entrees
 on the check would
 stand out in accounting.

754
00:49:27,165 --> 00:49:29,298
                  Plus, it'd
                  be dishonest.

755
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,033
                Hmm.

756
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:33,002
      Have a roll.

757
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,377
   You know,
   I figure since...

758
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:43,746
  I mean, we're pals
  now, right, guys?

759
00:49:43,748 --> 00:49:45,481
 You know,
 what if I told you

760
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,650
 what really happened
 to the bank money?

761
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,086
    Yeah.

762
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:51,253
 I'll tell you.

763
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:54,623
       I had it when I got
       out of the house.

764
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:58,260
 ...then, I passed out
 on the street,

765
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:03,199
       and someone
       stole it from me.

766
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:07,336
   So if you guys
   find that person,
   would you tell me?

767
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:09,605
 Because I really
 want that money back.

768
00:50:09,607 --> 00:50:10,773
       It's mine.

769
00:50:13,577 --> 00:50:16,545
    Yuk it up while
    you can, smart guy.

770
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:21,450
 Fuck, I already had
 "Yuk it up with idiot
 detectives" on my calendar.

771
00:50:38,102 --> 00:50:40,269
                   Boom, I win.

772
00:50:40,271 --> 00:50:42,204
           You did win.
           He's good.

773
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,673
             You're here early.
                 Uh-huh.

774
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:46,142
          Let's talk
          somewhere else, okay?

775
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,111
    Step into my office.

776
00:50:53,584 --> 00:50:55,785
 Did you think
 about what we talked
 about last night?

777
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,055
                 I'm just here
                 for my weekly.

778
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:00,456
 Forget about that.

779
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:01,590
   I think
   you're getting hung up

780
00:51:01,592 --> 00:51:04,260
   on the word "officer"
   in my job title.

781
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:06,495
 I'm not a law man...
 I'm a working stiff.

782
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:07,730
   So if you tell me
   where the money is,

783
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:10,066
 I'm not gonna turn
 it over to the police.

784
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,437
                   What's this?
 It's my criminal record.

785
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:16,238
 I lifted it from the file.
                      Whoa.

786
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,340
 Listen, nothing too heavy.

787
00:51:18,342 --> 00:51:20,476
 I'm not a peeping Tom,
 but kind of like
 a peeping Tom.

788
00:51:20,478 --> 00:51:25,214
 I was trying to steal a TV,
 but she just
 happened to be naked.

789
00:51:25,216 --> 00:51:26,348
 Just stuff like that.

790
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,317
            The money's gone...
            So here, I...

791
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,252
 No, no, no,
 no, no, no, no, no.

792
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:32,621
 Just read it, okay?
 Just read it.

793
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:36,659
   I've already
   committed a felony
   by letting you have it.

794
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:37,827
 It's already a crime.

795
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:41,297
   We're doing
   crime right now.

796
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:43,432
 So we might as well
 go ahead and
 jump out the window.

797
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,533
                       Yeah.
   Okay?

798
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:46,702
 Look, there's no "I"
 in "crime," man.

799
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,106
      Is there an "I" in crime?

800
00:52:04,754 --> 00:52:06,789
               You really don't
               have that money.

801
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:11,760
            No.

802
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:16,198
          Hey, man,
          I... I'm really sorry
          about yesterday,

803
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,568
          you know,
          the shovel, and the
          bleach, and all that.

804
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,237
                Can we just
                call it even?

805
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:28,544
          because I fucking
          found something
          in that safe. Get in.

806
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:31,780
 Wait, Ray, Ray.
 Where are we going?

807
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:34,250
              My place
              to talk business.

808
00:52:34,252 --> 00:52:35,818
   Listen, there's
   a couple of cops...

809
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,853
             Oh, your...
             Your friends won't
             be joining us.

810
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:39,688
               I put a banana
               in the tailpipe.

811
00:52:41,559 --> 00:52:43,459
               I saw it
               in a movie once.

812
00:52:53,304 --> 00:52:56,906
          Oh, I'm staying
          in the back,
          it's fucking awesome.

813
00:52:58,208 --> 00:52:59,642
              Beverly's letting
              you stay here?

814
00:52:59,644 --> 00:53:01,577
          Yeah, dude,
          just for
          a few months.

815
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:03,646
       I don't know
       if you'd call it
       a guest house,

816
00:53:03,648 --> 00:53:08,350
            or a cabana maybe,
            or a detached
            garage unit,

817
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:11,554
                  or a small,
                  independent
                  dwelling,

818
00:53:11,556 --> 00:53:14,223
             but it sure beats
             the shit out of
             your halfway hole.

819
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,794
              This time of day,
              nobody's home.

820
00:53:22,232 --> 00:53:24,567
              Oh, fuck yeah,
              chicken.

821
00:53:24,569 --> 00:53:27,336
       So, uh, the guy
       that lives here,
       he an asshole?

822
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:29,672
Totally.

823
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:33,242
 So this dead guy
 you've been
 cleaning up after,

824
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:35,411
 he didn't
 kill himself.

825
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:36,845
   He was taken out.

826
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:38,247
   Somebody stopped
   the dude's clock

827
00:53:38,249 --> 00:53:39,682
   and made it
   look like a suicide.

828
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:42,685
           Why would
           someone do that?

829
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:46,455
   He wasn't just
   a church custodian.

830
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:49,758
 at the
 Reynolds headquarters
 in Santa Monica.

831
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:50,926
 So check this out.

832
00:53:50,928 --> 00:53:53,229
         <i> He's up there</i>
         <i> every night</i>

833
00:53:53,231 --> 00:53:57,266
       <i> sweeping up,</i>
       <i> and poking around</i>
       <i> in people's desks</i>

834
00:53:57,268 --> 00:53:59,368
       <i> for spare change,</i>
       <i> credit cards,</i>

835
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:01,270
 whatever he could
 fucking find
 worth lifting.

836
00:54:01,272 --> 00:54:03,239
           Yeah, but you don't
           kill a guy for that.

837
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:05,374
   No, you don't.

838
00:54:05,376 --> 00:54:08,644
 But one night,
 Mr. Paul finds himself

839
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:13,249
 in the office of fucking
 Vice President of Sales
 Graham Huffman.

840
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:15,317
    <i> He's doing</i>
    <i> a little poking around,</i>

841
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:16,552
   <i> and he finds these babies.</i>

842
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,488
        Bam!

843
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:21,657
    This, my friend,
    is amateur porn

844
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:25,661
  starring Huffman
  and about 27
  fucking prostitutes.

845
00:54:25,663 --> 00:54:27,263
 Shot right in his office.

846
00:54:27,265 --> 00:54:29,031
        <i> He's doing</i>
        <i> 'em on his desk.</i>

847
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:30,733
     <i> He's doing 'em</i>
     <i> on his fucking couch.</i>

848
00:54:30,735 --> 00:54:32,935
        The orange one,
        my favorite.

849
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:34,403
          He's fucking
          three of 'em

850
00:54:34,405 --> 00:54:37,006
     standing at the window
     overlooking downtown.

851
00:54:37,008 --> 00:54:39,842
                 You've got
                 'em memorized.
 Of course I do.

852
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:43,979
 So Mr. Paul figures
 he hit the blackmail
 fucking jackpot,

853
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:46,015
   swipes the DVDs,

854
00:54:46,017 --> 00:54:48,751
   sends Huffman
   a little letter

855
00:54:48,753 --> 00:54:51,954
 demanding 200 grand
 to get 'em back

856
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:56,058
 or Huffman's wife and kids
 get a private screening.

857
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,926
               Instead of
               paying the guy,

858
00:54:57,928 --> 00:54:59,461
             Huffman kills him.

859
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:00,763
                 Makes it look
                 like suicide.

860
00:55:00,765 --> 00:55:01,897
                Son of a bitch.

861
00:55:01,899 --> 00:55:03,365
      Mmm-hmm.

862
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,740
           You wanna pick
           up where Mr. Paul
           left off, don't you?

863
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:13,642
 Mmm-hmm, but we're
 gonna be more careful

864
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:17,012
 because it's two guys
 blackmailing him,

865
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:18,981
   and so he's not gonna
   try anything cute.

866
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:21,450
                That's why
                you apologized,
                shit.

867
00:55:21,452 --> 00:55:22,818
      Good plan, right?

868
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,957
               Okay, I'm in.

869
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:34,463
    Hey, do you wanna
    watch the orange one...
    With me?

870
00:55:34,465 --> 00:55:35,931
Hey, so when we go see
         this Huffman guy,

871
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:38,067
         we gotta look
         like we're successful,

872
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:40,436
             like we don't even
             need his money,

873
00:55:40,438 --> 00:55:42,938
      like we're just
      blackmailing him for fun.

874
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:47,876
   Whoa.

875
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:49,478
             How do I look?

876
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,413
   You look like
   Don fucking Johnson.

877
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:53,749
          That's exactly right.

878
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:56,385
              Get out of
              my fucking way!

879
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:58,387
Not bad.

880
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:00,856
                    Hey.

881
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:03,926
                 Huffman,
                 how are you?

882
00:56:03,928 --> 00:56:06,628
               Listen, uh,
               we're gonna need
               that money.

883
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,430
          Now.

884
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:11,967
               And if you don't
               present it...

885
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:14,002
          Now.

886
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:16,138
              Really bad things
              are gonna happen.

887
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:17,940
          Now.

888
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,677
        You mess with the bull,
        you get the horns.

889
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:29,551
      Hey, where do you
      think the guy keeps
      the hair gel around here?

890
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:32,888
              Definitely look
              like 200,000 now.

891
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:34,390
         Change of
         plans, buddy.

892
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:35,991
  We're blackmailing
  that son of a bitch

893
00:56:35,993 --> 00:56:38,660
  for the return of
  his dirty movies and
  Mr. Paul's murder.

894
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:40,662
 Together, that's more,
 like, 500 grand.

895
00:56:40,664 --> 00:56:42,664
          So what happens
          if he comes up short?

896
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:45,634
 He's a
 Senior Vice President
 in charge of sales, man.

897
00:56:45,636 --> 00:56:47,536
 If he doesn't have it,
 he can embezzle it.

898
00:56:47,538 --> 00:56:49,037
   And guess what?
   If he does that,

899
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:52,074
 we'll go back
 and we'll blackmail
 him for that too.

900
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:53,709
   It's the circle
   of life, man.

901
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:56,178
 <i> Hakuna matata,</i> bitch!

902
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:01,417
   Hey, I don't
   have to, uh...

903
00:57:01,419 --> 00:57:03,886
 I don't have to tell
 you not to tell Bev
 about any of this, do I?

904
00:57:03,888 --> 00:57:05,087
                      Right.

905
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,555
              This is
              between us, okay?

906
00:57:06,557 --> 00:57:07,956
          This is our business.

907
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:09,191
               So me and Ray
               are blackmailing

908
00:57:09,193 --> 00:57:10,726
          this executive
          from Reynolds Metals.

909
00:57:10,728 --> 00:57:11,827
                    He's pretty
                    high up.

910
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:13,095
             We've got some
             good stuff on him.

911
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:14,630
   You and Ray?
                      Yeah.

912
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:18,200
 If only you weren't
 interested in a man
 who wants to kill you.

913
00:57:18,202 --> 00:57:19,835
               He doesn't wanna
               kill me, okay?

914
00:57:19,837 --> 00:57:21,603
                   I got it.

915
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,906
             We're gonna take
             this guy for 500k,

916
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:26,108
                and then,
                after tomorrow,

917
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:28,444
       I will be able to
       support you and William.

918
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:31,447
             We'll be a family.
             We'll start over.

919
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:33,582
   Are you serious?

920
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:35,751
                      Yeah.

921
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,986
              Offer still open?

922
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:40,155
   Of course it is.

923
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:46,028
  You know that it is.

924
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:54,670
I remember my first time.

925
00:57:54,672 --> 00:57:56,505
                  Ricky Watson.

926
00:57:56,507 --> 00:57:58,207
          He was my best friend
          in the third grade.

927
00:57:58,209 --> 00:58:01,076
          He was my only friend
          in the third grade.

928
00:58:01,078 --> 00:58:05,514
         He had this
         Spider-Man comic book.

929
00:58:05,516 --> 00:58:07,049
          Wouldn't let
          anybody else read it.

930
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:08,984
              I had to have it.

931
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:11,720
 He was bigger than me,
 so I found some shit on him,

932
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:13,522
 blackmailed the fuck
 out of him.

933
00:58:13,524 --> 00:58:14,723
 He wasn't
 my friend anymore,

934
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:15,991
   but at least
   I got the comic book.

935
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:19,027
 That's nothing, dude.

936
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:21,697
 My first time blackmailing
 was my own dad.

937
00:58:22,867 --> 00:58:26,935
        My old man was always
        running around on
        my mom, and I hated it.

938
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:29,271
              So one day,
              I threw a pair
              of panties at him

939
00:58:29,273 --> 00:58:31,507
   and told him I found them
   in the back seat of his car,

940
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:35,043
          and unless
          he paid me ten bucks,
          I was gonna tell Mom.

941
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:37,112
          The fucker paid me...

942
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:39,248
   ...not once,
   but for the next three years

943
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,049
     every Sunday after church.

944
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:42,718
       But here's the kicker...
       I didn't, uh,

945
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:43,919
               find the panties
               in his car.

946
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:45,754
               I took 'em from
               my mom's drawer.

947
00:58:45,756 --> 00:58:47,890
       He didn't even recognize
       his own wife's panties.

948
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:52,127
      Fucking idiot...
      I mean, you'd think he
      would've been pissed,

949
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:55,063
         but it was like
         he was grateful,

950
00:58:55,065 --> 00:58:58,200
   you know, like I was helping
   the bastard make penance.

951
00:58:58,202 --> 00:58:59,601
       That's fucked up.

952
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:04,940
 So what made him stop paying
 after the three years passed?

953
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:08,210
       Ah, my fucking mom died.

954
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:10,913
              Yeah, she was
              fucking great.

955
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:17,619
 Want another?
               Yeah.

956
00:59:21,124 --> 00:59:22,925
                 Can I ask you
                 a question?

957
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:24,259
            Why are you and Bev
            so touch and go?

958
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:26,662
   I could never
   figure that out.

959
00:59:26,664 --> 00:59:30,098
   I used to gamble...
   A lot.

960
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,569
 And I hit
 a pretty cold streak,

961
00:59:33,571 --> 00:59:37,005
 so I forged Bev's signature
 and sold my parent's place.

962
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:40,342
     She was fucking pissed,
     and, uh...

963
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:42,044
   ...then two guys threatened
   to kill us both,

964
00:59:42,046 --> 00:59:43,312
       so I had
       to do something.

965
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:44,780
          Oh.

966
00:59:44,782 --> 00:59:48,817
 And that was when you
 got into, uh, gay porn.

967
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:51,987
              What? Wait, wait,
              Bev told you
              I did gay porn?

968
00:59:51,989 --> 00:59:57,292
          No. I didn't do
          fucking gay porn.
          I sucked my own dick.

969
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:02,598
  You... You...
  You can suck
  your own dick?

970
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,867
       You know, I could
       when I was 20, but fuck.

971
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:07,336
       I mean, now I got
       a bad back.

972
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:08,737
      I eat so many
      fucking waffles,

973
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:11,340
        I can't even get to it,
        you know?

974
01:00:11,342 --> 01:00:13,175
 Strikes me
 as a little gay.

975
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:16,111
              I mean, isn't it
              just like fucking
              masturbating?

976
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:20,148
 Yeah, but you have
 a dick in your mouth.

977
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,017
      That's pretty impressive,
      though, still.

978
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:26,288
               Oh, not again.

979
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:32,227
You know how to play,
 uh, table football?
               Yeah.

980
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:35,664
             We're gonna turn
             'em up, two posts.

981
01:00:35,666 --> 01:00:38,333
        There you go, this is
        gonna be real football.

982
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:43,038
          Keep your posts up...
          Keep it up like
          that, you ready?

983
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,640
                    Hold it up.

984
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:46,842
              Ready, and oop...

985
01:00:46,844 --> 01:00:48,210
Oh!

986
01:00:48,212 --> 01:00:50,646
I missed, I missed,
            here we go.

987
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:51,880
   Okay, ready?
                     Your turn.

988
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:53,115
   Let's see
   if we can get it.
                      Go ahead.

989
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:54,750
             No, no, you get...
             You're the kicker.

990
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:55,851
   Ready to kick it, ready?

991
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:57,419
 One, two, three, go.

992
01:00:57,421 --> 01:00:58,920
                      Oh!

993
01:00:58,922 --> 01:01:00,422
                  You almost...
                  Oh, sh...

994
01:01:00,424 --> 01:01:01,990
   Jesus, Tell.

995
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:04,226
               Okay, I'm sorry,
               I'm sorry.

996
01:01:04,228 --> 01:01:05,427
   Okay.
                     I'm sorry.

997
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:09,031
 I'm just gonna
 go to the bathroom
 really quick.

998
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:10,298
 Can you watch
 him, please?
                      Yeah.

999
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,000
   I'll be right
   back, okay?
          Okay.

1000
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:13,135
   Okay.

1001
01:01:13,137 --> 01:01:14,236
 You guys
 have fun playing.

1002
01:01:14,238 --> 01:01:15,937
       That... It wasn't me,
       it was him.

1003
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:17,806
It was him.

1004
01:01:17,808 --> 01:01:19,007
                     It was me.
   Yeah, it was.

1005
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,075
 Good job.
                      Yeah.

1006
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:26,815
             Here, buddy,
             you can have that.

1007
01:01:26,817 --> 01:01:28,283
        It's your football now.

1008
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,425
                  Hey.

1009
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:38,960
              William, do you
              think, um...

1010
01:01:38,962 --> 01:01:40,962
               Do you think
               maybe sometime,
               you'd want me

1011
01:01:40,964 --> 01:01:42,297
             to come over
             and play football?

1012
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:43,699
       Yes.

1013
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:47,102
              Yeah?
              Okay, okay.

1014
01:01:47,104 --> 01:01:48,904
          So then maybe when...
          When your mom

1015
01:01:48,906 --> 01:01:50,972
     comes out of the bathroom,
     you could tell her.

1016
01:01:50,974 --> 01:01:52,908
            Say, "I want Tell
            to come over
            and play football."

1017
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:54,976
   She's not my mom.

1018
01:02:00,249 --> 01:02:02,851
          Buddy... Who is that?

1019
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:05,187
 That's Aunt Bev-Bev.

1020
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,389
                   Who?

1021
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:09,057
 That's Aunt Bev-Bev.

1022
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:13,862
                 Oh, evil.

1023
01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:15,197
                 Fuck.

1024
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,168
Fuck.

1025
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:22,404
                Good as new?

1026
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:24,740
Good as new.

1027
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:25,774
Are you?

1028
01:02:25,776 --> 01:02:27,876
Well, almost.

1029
01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:29,878
Yeah.

1030
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,217
          Hey, William...
          Good seeing you, bud.

1031
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:36,284
                     Okay.

1032
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:40,422
He's a great kid.

1033
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:45,927
 He looks just like us,
 only smaller
 and more round.

1034
01:02:50,299 --> 01:02:52,901
 So, um, when are you
 gonna do the job?

1035
01:02:52,903 --> 01:02:55,470
             Tonight's the job.
        Great.

1036
01:02:55,472 --> 01:02:57,839
   Then, I will
   wait for you.

1037
01:02:57,841 --> 01:02:58,907
                       Okay.

1038
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:01,476
           Not in front of him.

1039
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:03,311
        Right.
                    Yeah.

1040
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:04,946
Not yet.

1041
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:09,317
            Are you ready, bud?

1042
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:10,352
   Yeah.

1043
01:03:10,354 --> 01:03:12,154
             Say bye to Tell...
             Bye, Tell.

1044
01:03:12,156 --> 01:03:13,321
                           Bye.

1045
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:26,168
Oh, jeez...

1046
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:33,008
             Shit, fucking,
             shit, fuck.

1047
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:44,920
                  What's wrong?

1048
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,455
           What?
                  Why are
                  you so quiet?

1049
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:48,990
         No reason.

1050
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,359
                   You nervous?

1051
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:53,261
          Hell, no.

1052
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:56,064
     I'm just thinking,
     what if, uh...

1053
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:58,533
   ...this Huffman fucker
   shows up traveling light?

1054
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:02,137
                I don't know...
                How light?

1055
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:03,371
     I don't know...
     Let's say half.

1056
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:06,441
             Half, I think
             that buys him
             about a day.

1057
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:10,345
      We're not blackmailing
      this guy in installments.

1058
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,115
 What if he shows up
 with 50 or 60 grand?

1059
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:16,184
              That's just
              an insult.

1060
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,120
            Anything less
            than 100,000,

1061
01:04:19,122 --> 01:04:20,288
           we're gonna have to
           do something

1062
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:22,224
           so this guy knows
           we mean business.

1063
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:25,126
        Did you bring
        the bleach?
        'Cause I didn't.

1064
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:34,002
             There's nothing
             to worry about,
             this guy's scared.

1065
01:04:34,004 --> 01:04:36,271
              He wouldn't dare
              try and stiff us.

1066
01:04:36,273 --> 01:04:40,275
    Yeah, he wouldn't
    'cause we're no
    dumb-ass custodians.

1067
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,078
        Oh, shit,
        there he is.

1068
01:04:45,015 --> 01:04:46,147
                    With a bag.

1069
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:47,949
                   We're on.

1070
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:51,152
 Uh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.

1071
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:58,026
   I, uh, came alone
   like you said.

1072
01:04:58,028 --> 01:05:00,161
           Smart man.

1073
01:05:00,163 --> 01:05:01,263
       Let's see the green.

1074
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,465
         Oh.

1075
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:12,674
     And my DVDs?

1076
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:15,644
           Right here, Fellini.

1077
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:20,248
 Toss us the bag,
 then you can take
 your dirty movies and go.

1078
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,507
<i>-  When I was a kid, I thought</i>
<i>-  I was gonna be somebody,</i>

1079
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:49,377
    <i> a model citizen raising</i>
    <i> a family in the suburbs.</i>

1080
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:53,081
      <i> That never happened.</i>

1081
01:05:53,083 --> 01:05:55,183
     <i> But there is a point</i>
     <i> when you find yourself</i>

1082
01:05:55,185 --> 01:05:57,185
    <i> in a moment, and realize</i>

1083
01:05:57,187 --> 01:05:58,620
      <i> the decisions</i>
      <i> you made were wrong,</i>

1084
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:02,023
  <i> and they led you</i>
  <i> to a different kind of life.</i>

1085
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:06,661
   <i> I should've settled down.</i>

1086
01:06:06,663 --> 01:06:08,263
       <i> Got a nine-to-five.</i>

1087
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:10,565
         <i> Bought a house</i>
         <i> with a porch.</i>

1088
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:20,508
      <i> Taken my kid</i>
      <i> to Pee-Wee football</i>
      <i> on the weekends,</i>

1089
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:23,578
   <i> and enjoyed the happiness</i>
   <i> of not being shot at.</i>

1090
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:43,264
               <i> Fuck.</i>

1091
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:45,133
  <i> I should've been a doctor...</i>

1092
01:06:45,135 --> 01:06:47,135
           <i> An accountant...</i>

1093
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:49,704
       <i> A goddamn coal miner.</i>

1094
01:06:51,375 --> 01:06:53,475
       <i> Should've been</i>
       <i> anything but this.</i>

1095
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,625
                 Oh, shit, Ray.

1096
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:12,227
                Fuck. Just keep
                pressure on it.

1097
01:07:12,229 --> 01:07:15,230
 It's... It's just a little
 flesh wound, right?

1098
01:07:15,232 --> 01:07:16,598
          Yeah, just a scratch.

1099
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,533
         Come on...
         Let's go, we gotta go.

1100
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:20,135
     Let's get the fuck
     out of here.

1101
01:07:20,137 --> 01:07:22,170
                  We gotta go.
                Ah.

1102
01:07:22,172 --> 01:07:23,772
            Okay, keep that on.

1103
01:07:25,275 --> 01:07:26,374
                     Come on.

1104
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:31,046
                     Okay.
           Hey, guys?

1105
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:32,614
   Has the shooting stopped?
   Is it safe to come out now?

1106
01:07:32,616 --> 01:07:34,182
 We would've come out
 sooner, but...

1107
01:07:34,184 --> 01:07:35,517
                      Oh, fuck.

1108
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:37,452
 I don't know, I was scared.
 It sounded dangerous.

1109
01:07:37,454 --> 01:07:39,621
           Oh, come on,
           what the fuck, guys?

1110
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:42,090
   Put that pea shooter
   on the ground.

1111
01:07:42,092 --> 01:07:43,425
   On your knees now.

1112
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:46,594
                 Shit.

1113
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:50,331
     Oh, ho-ho, talk about
     your textbook crime scene.

1114
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,600
   I mean, we got the murder
   victim, we got the murderer.

1115
01:07:52,602 --> 01:07:54,269
         This guy tried
         to kill us, all right?

1116
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:55,770
        I shot in self-defense.
             We say different.

1117
01:07:55,772 --> 01:07:58,306
 You got about two minutes
 until our backup shows up

1118
01:07:58,308 --> 01:08:00,842
 unless you tell us
 where the money is.

1119
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:05,313
 This entire messy
 crime scene goes
 away, okay?

1120
01:08:05,315 --> 01:08:07,082
 You get to go free.

1121
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,617
        I shot in self-defense.

1122
01:08:09,619 --> 01:08:12,287
       Ray saw the whole thing.
       Fuck you, he'll testify.

1123
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:13,555
    That's right, baby.

1124
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:14,756
     I'll swear to tell
     the whole truth

1125
01:08:14,758 --> 01:08:17,325
   and nothing
   but the goddamn truth.

1126
01:08:17,327 --> 01:08:18,393
                          Fuck.

1127
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:20,728
Fuck, he's right.

1128
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:22,297
 He is.

1129
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:23,565
 They sure as hell
 got us now.

1130
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,733
Oh!

1131
01:08:25,735 --> 01:08:26,801
                 What the fuck?

1132
01:08:26,803 --> 01:08:28,136
   Fuck!

1133
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:29,838
                   Ray?

1134
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:34,576
 You saw that,
 he was coming at me.
 Oh, yeah.

1135
01:08:34,578 --> 01:08:35,643
     I was scared.

1136
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:37,645
          Son of a bitch... Oh!

1137
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,149
            In case you haven't
            realized it,

1138
01:08:41,151 --> 01:08:43,251
     we're done screwing around
     with you, smart guy.

1139
01:08:43,253 --> 01:08:45,120
            I warned you
            not to piss me off.

1140
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:47,555
I got the money!

1141
01:08:47,557 --> 01:08:49,724
 Look at this!
 It's the fucking money!

1142
01:08:49,726 --> 01:08:51,726
         What do you mean
         you got the money?
 Look.

1143
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:53,394
        What fucking
        money is that?

1144
01:08:53,396 --> 01:08:56,131
        It's money.

1145
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:57,365
  Well, then we don't
  need this guy no more.

1146
01:08:57,367 --> 01:08:58,533
     No, no, no,
     that's not the bank money!

1147
01:08:58,535 --> 01:09:00,135
   That's not the bank money!

1148
01:09:00,137 --> 01:09:01,369
       What do you mean
       it's not the bank money?

1149
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:02,804
          There's more,
          there's so much more.

1150
01:09:02,806 --> 01:09:04,205
    There's so much more money.

1151
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:06,241
        That's not
        the bank money, please.

1152
01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:07,775
           Where's it at?

1153
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:09,744
 Where is it?

1154
01:09:10,546 --> 01:09:12,547
                  Jefferson.
   I told you!

1155
01:09:12,549 --> 01:09:14,682
 I told you
 it was at the Jefferson.

1156
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:17,752
   Come on, come on, come on.

1157
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:19,687
        All right, smart guy,
        get up. Let's go.

1158
01:09:20,756 --> 01:09:22,857
               <i> ¶</i>

1159
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:25,393
This is exactly
 a half a million dollars.

1160
01:09:25,395 --> 01:09:26,895
No shit!

1161
01:09:26,897 --> 01:09:28,696
                Son of a bitch.

1162
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:30,532
           Are there any marks?

1163
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:32,300
 No, looks
 like it's clean.

1164
01:09:32,302 --> 01:09:34,302
                  50-50, right?

1165
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:37,272
   70-30.
                        No, no.

1166
01:09:37,274 --> 01:09:38,773
  50-50, that's the bank money.

1167
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:39,841
           This is other money.

1168
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:42,777
 No, kiddo,
 70-30, that's our split.

1169
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:45,346
 In six months, I'm headed
 to retirement.

1170
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:46,548
 Trust me,
 20 years from now,

1171
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:47,815
 you won't remember
 any of this stuff.

1172
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:51,553
 You tell her the same thing
 the second time.

1173
01:10:27,356 --> 01:10:28,423
                     Which way?

1174
01:10:28,425 --> 01:10:30,425
           Service stairs,
           down two floors.

1175
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:31,759
             Come on, let's go.

1176
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,372
                         Where?

1177
01:11:17,374 --> 01:11:18,706
 It's jammed
 inside the panel

1178
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:20,908
       in back of
       the third machine!

1179
01:11:22,544 --> 01:11:25,747
You climbed back there
 with a bullet in your gut?

1180
01:11:28,717 --> 01:11:30,852
      You're going!

1181
01:11:30,854 --> 01:11:32,387
       You're going
       with him!

1182
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:55,043
              You gotta help me
              pull it off!

1183
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:05,520
        Well?

1184
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:09,557
           He's looking for it!

1185
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:11,359
         What?

1186
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:15,596
 He's got the bag!

1187
01:12:24,974 --> 01:12:30,978
               <i> ¶</i>

1188
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:53,568
                     It's okay.
                     I'm a cop!

1189
01:12:56,106 --> 01:12:58,039
        It's all right,
        I do this for a living!

1190
01:12:59,442 --> 01:13:01,409
   It's all right,
   go backwards.

1191
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:05,380
   Stay in your car.

1192
01:13:05,382 --> 01:13:07,482
Don't get out of your...

1193
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:17,725
               I told you
               I was a bad-ass.

1194
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:28,035
                     Whoa!
 Half of the bank money.

1195
01:13:28,037 --> 01:13:29,704
 There's 500,000 in there.

1196
01:13:29,706 --> 01:13:31,639
Are you
            fucking kidding me?

1197
01:13:31,641 --> 01:13:33,608
           I knew you
           fucking had it.

1198
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:35,476
              I knew you had it
              all along.

1199
01:13:35,478 --> 01:13:37,678
      Okay.
                   Yeah.

1200
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:41,449
          Yeah, but there is
          an "I" in let's get
          the fuck out of here.

1201
01:13:41,451 --> 01:13:43,151
             Let's go, come on.

1202
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,625
                   Let's go!

1203
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:55,496
      First thing I'm gonna do
      is buy me a car

1204
01:13:55,498 --> 01:13:57,765
       I can fit my fat ass in!

1205
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:40,101
                Jesus, Tell.
                What happened?

1206
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:43,905
            Ray didn't come
            home last night.

1207
01:15:43,907 --> 01:15:45,273
 The whole thing
 went wrong.

1208
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:49,577
   We thought the guy
   was gonna roll over and...

1209
01:15:49,579 --> 01:15:50,811
        ...but he had a gun.

1210
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:53,548
            He shot Ray?

1211
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:56,317
        They all shot Ray.

1212
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,053
             And the money?

1213
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:05,560
          Wow.

1214
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:09,964
            Wow.

1215
01:16:09,966 --> 01:16:12,333
 Took you less than 30 seconds
 to ask about the money.

1216
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:16,571
              The whole point
              of this was the
              money, wasn't it?

1217
01:16:16,573 --> 01:16:18,773
 Meaning what? That...
 That as long
 as I got the money,

1218
01:16:18,775 --> 01:16:20,241
   it doesn't matter
   that Ray's dead?

1219
01:16:20,243 --> 01:16:21,842
              Don't you make
              me the bad guy.

1220
01:16:21,844 --> 01:16:23,844
              Don't you
              do that to me!

1221
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:26,581
 You guys were the
 idiots who were
 blackmailing him, not me!

1222
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:30,217
 That's all you ever have been,
 is about the money.

1223
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:31,652
     Where is this coming from?

1224
01:16:31,654 --> 01:16:33,354
      You lied to me
      about William,

1225
01:16:33,356 --> 01:16:34,989
 and you don't care
 if I get hurt,

1226
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:36,824
  or if that
  little boy gets hurt,

1227
01:16:36,826 --> 01:16:40,027
 as long as you get...
 Your money.

1228
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:42,697
              I didn't lie
              about William.

1229
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:44,966
       He's not my kid!

1230
01:16:44,968 --> 01:16:48,669
 Fuck, he's not even
 your kid, Aunt Beverly.

1231
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:54,742
             Who said that?

1232
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:56,811
        William.

1233
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:01,082
           He is my son.

1234
01:17:02,351 --> 01:17:04,385
            He is our son.

1235
01:17:04,387 --> 01:17:06,287
   So you're telling me
   he doesn't know
   who his mother is?

1236
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:08,289
   That's... That's
   what you're saying?

1237
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:09,957
           That's exactly
           what I'm saying.

1238
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:23,037
           When I gave birth...

1239
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:25,906
          ...my cousin Margaret
          was with me,

1240
01:17:25,908 --> 01:17:30,911
        and I didn't have
        a job or a place to go,

1241
01:17:30,913 --> 01:17:34,715
           so she and her
           fiance offered to...

1242
01:17:34,717 --> 01:17:35,983
               ...take him.

1243
01:17:38,954 --> 01:17:40,388
                And I let them.

1244
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:45,393
        They are his parents
        as far as anyone knows.

1245
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,029
              She's his mom.

1246
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:53,300
          God, she's his mom...

1247
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:58,005
                ...and I'm just
                Aunt Beverly.

1248
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:03,144
      Aunt Beverly who lives
      in the bungalow out back.

1249
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:08,949
     Aunt Beverly who baby-sits
     all the time,

1250
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:12,753
       who can't stop
       kissing and hugging him.

1251
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:17,224
          That's why
          I needed the money...

1252
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:21,328
              ...so I could get
              my son back.

1253
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:25,266
                 So we could
                 be a family.

1254
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:30,404
                I'm so sorry.

1255
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:48,255
                      Hey, Bev?

1256
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:50,324
       Yeah?

1257
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:53,828
    You think you could loan me
    a couple bucks?

1258
01:18:55,797 --> 01:18:56,964
         What for?

1259
01:19:51,419 --> 01:19:53,187
         If it's there,
         we'll find it.

1260
01:19:53,189 --> 01:19:55,523
Fucking morons.

1261
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:29,423
            You look beautiful.

1262
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:33,494
 What are you
 doing here?

1263
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:36,564
 Aren't you supposed
 to be holed up?

1264
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:40,334
        Yeah, I'm gonna get out
        of town for a while

1265
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:42,303
                till this thing
                blows over,

1266
01:20:42,305 --> 01:20:46,240
      but, um, before I go,
      I have something for you.

1267
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:00,120
   What's this?

1268
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:01,589
            Um, you said
            if I had the money,

1269
01:21:01,591 --> 01:21:03,190
             I could be a part
             of William's life.

1270
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:08,295
              That's the money.

1271
01:21:08,297 --> 01:21:11,532
             I figured William
             should have Ray's
             end of the deal...

1272
01:21:12,635 --> 01:21:14,068
                 Considering
                 what happened.

1273
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:16,136
Are you serious?

1274
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,907
   This is mine?

1275
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:24,144
 This changes everything.

1276
01:21:24,146 --> 01:21:26,247
 We can be together now,
 You, me, William...

1277
01:21:26,249 --> 01:21:28,048
              No, no, Bev, Bev.

1278
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:30,384
                It's William's.

1279
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:32,586
                It's not yours.

1280
01:21:38,526 --> 01:21:40,194
          Come on, look at him.

1281
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:43,964
              Look at him.

1282
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:54,408
   It's one better than our
   fucked-up shit can give him.

1283
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:56,577
      You and me, we're broken.

1284
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:58,612
       We can't change that,
       money can't change that.

1285
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,284
                 This gives
                 him a chance.

1286
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:09,290
              He's a lucky kid.

1287
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:13,627
        He's got doting parents

1288
01:22:13,629 --> 01:22:17,131
        and an aunt who would
        literally kill for him.

1289
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:23,103
                  I'm gonna go.

1290
01:23:26,301 --> 01:23:28,402
   65, 70.

1291
01:23:28,404 --> 01:23:34,308
 One, two, three, four. Huh?

1292
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:36,377
Thank you, father.

1293
01:23:36,379 --> 01:23:38,278
 Hey, you did
 a fantastic job this week.

1294
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:40,047
   You earned it.

1295
01:23:40,049 --> 01:23:42,683
               To me, it never
               really was about
               the money.

1296
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:45,552
                     Thank you.
