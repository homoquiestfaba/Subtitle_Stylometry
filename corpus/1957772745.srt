1
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:02,702
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:06,139
(tense menacing music)

3
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:14,180
(dramatic music)

4
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:17,550
(tense ominous music)

5
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,688
(crickets chirping)

6
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:33,266
(tense foreboding music)

7
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,939
(gunshot cracks)

8
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:43,176
(crickets chirping)

9
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:46,255
I was trying to have a hot girl summer,

10
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,214
but I can't even do that no more,

11
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:49,592
because you got so much attention on you.

12
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,227
Really? Definitely
time for hot girl summer.

13
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,019
You know I can't anymore.

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,054
Oh my God.

15
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,197
I want to be a hoe. I can't even.

16
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,723
That is not on me.

17
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:57,756
Don't do that.

18
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,559
(indistinct) My whole thing.

19
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:00,460
No.

20
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,128
(indistinct) Why didn't she ask?

21
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:02,996
Don't do that.

22
00:01:03,029 --> 00:01:05,765
She got a new... Hold on.

23
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,799
Hello.

24
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,870
(birds chirping)

25
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,543
Kionna, what's wrong?

26
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:19,511
Ki, what's wrong?

27
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:22,448
Ki.

28
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,651
They killed Zaif.

29
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:26,686
(sighs)

30
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:36,496
(dramatic ominous music)

31
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,307
(birds chirping)

32
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,975
Now, thanks for stepping up

33
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,044
now that Zaif is no longer with us.

34
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,079
Shit, ain't no problem.

35
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,447
Hold on real quick.

36
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,182
(sighs)

37
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,116
Hello?

38
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:06,152
(birds chirping)

39
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,754
All right, I'll let her know.

40
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:08,721
(birds chirping)

41
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,757
Yo, we not gonna have no more problem

42
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,424
from that bitch ass nigga

43
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:13,259
from the South side crew.

44
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:17,230
Good, because it's get
down or lay down season.

45
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,541
[Tray] You're motherfucking right.

46
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:19,465
(sighs)

47
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,201
If anyone from any of these other crews

48
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,669
don't wanna get down with us,

49
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,772
they gonna get laid down by
us and it's that fucking simple.

50
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:28,374
Shit, they're either
helping us or hurting us,

51
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,609
with us or against us.

52
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,912
Now we take over the whole fucking city.

53
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,884
(air whooshing)

54
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,987
(footsteps plodding)

55
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,427
Yeah, what's up Tray?

56
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,628
What's good, bro?

57
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:50,563
You ready to get back
to putting this work in?

58
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm always ready to get
that work in, you know that.

59
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,468
All right, good.

60
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,371
Kionna wanna make sure you
100% before you come back though.

61
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:02,542
I'm not a hundred yet, but
I'm ready to get back to work.

62
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,812
She don't want you to rush this shit.

63
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,247
We got big plans lined up,

64
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,683
we gonna need you to be
ready for what's about to go down.

65
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,753
I'm ready for whatever
Kionna need me to do.

66
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:14,454
(laughs)

67
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,322
You really hungry for that work?

68
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:18,725
That's the shit I like to see.

69
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:21,227
(birds chirping)

70
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,929
That's how we going build this operation

71
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,042
with solid niggas like you.

72
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:27,967
Now that we got these
bitch ass niggas out the way

73
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,569
what's next?

74
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,638
I'm meeting with Kionna
in the next few days

75
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:33,406
about all the ins and outs.

76
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,618
What does it look like to you?

77
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,577
We gonna handle business or what?

78
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,547
Now, listen, this ain't official,

79
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,815
but the way she been talking,

80
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,220
I think we about to
take this whole city over.

81
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,155
Oh, we getting busy like that?

82
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:50,189
Mm-hmm.

83
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,492
Now, I can't say 100%,

84
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:55,295
but I think she wants to
be more than just the queen

85
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:56,796
of the trap house.

86
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,463
Mm-hmm.

87
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:58,464
The way she talking,

88
00:04:58,498 --> 00:04:59,608
I think she wants to be the queen

89
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,100
of this whole fucking city.

90
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,936
She talking like she wanna
take the throne for real.

91
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,040
Taking her throne, that's
what the fuck I'm talking about.

92
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,676
I gotta meet with her
and see for sure though,

93
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:12,712
but it's definitely looking that way.

94
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,981
I'm gonna be back to normal soon

95
00:05:15,014 --> 00:05:17,226
and then we gonna set all
these bitch ass niggas straight.

96
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,518
You can bet on that.

97
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,453
As soon as I get the rundown from her,

98
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,664
I'm gonna be in contact with you

99
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,324
and let you know what it is, the full plan.

100
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,792
That's what's up.

101
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,860
Let her know I'm ready to get back to work

102
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,338
and then take over this whole motherfucker.

103
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,930
(chuckles)

104
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,733
Yeah, I know she'll be
glad to see you still on board.

105
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:36,035
We need soldiers like you
to make this work for us.

106
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,372
Tell Kionna I'm ready
to build this whole empire

107
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:41,040
however high she wants to take it.

108
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,310
All right, I'll hit you
back in a few days.

109
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,113
(birds chirping)

110
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,949
So what are you gonna
do now that Tyreke's gone?

111
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,486
I got a couple options I'm looking at.

112
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,588
What do you mean by that?

113
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,124
Nesha, I'm not gonna lie to you.

114
00:05:58,157 --> 00:05:59,225
Okay.

115
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:00,159
There's some things I still wanna do

116
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,861
with Tyreke's operation.

117
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:04,831
Oh, I know you're
still involved in that shit.

118
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,432
Believe me, I know.

119
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,401
How do you know what I'm doing out here?

120
00:06:08,434 --> 00:06:09,578
You don't think I don't hear

121
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,204
what you do in these streets?

122
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:11,971
(scoffs)

123
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,172
Girl.

124
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,808
So much for trying
to fly under the radar.

125
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:17,944
You know how it is out here, girl.

126
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:20,880
These motherfuckers do not
keep their damn mouth shut.

127
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:21,981
So what are you doing?

128
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:23,883
Just keeping track of what I'm doing?

129
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,729
I mean, I knew that
you weren't gonna just

130
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,122
jump right out of the game
because Tyreke is gone.

131
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,626
And I knew when you said,
"He was only going to help him

132
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,963
"until he got home," it was some bullshit.

133
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,765
Okay, look, I did not expect things

134
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,199
to go down the way they did.

135
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,168
(birds chirping)

136
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,237
What really did happen to Tyreke?

137
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,872
I don't know, shit happens, I guess.

138
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:46,939
(birds chirping)

139
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:47,907
Yeah, okay.

140
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,909
I think it may be something like,

141
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:53,079
hell happened (indistinct)
like a woman's born.

142
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:53,880
(laughs)

143
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,847
(birds chirping)

144
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:58,050
I heard he got to
beef with niggas in jail.

145
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:58,718
Mm-hmm.

146
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,052
And shit went sideways.

147
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,722
Yeah, some niggas you paid for.

148
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,492
Girl, you are wild as a hell for that.

149
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:08,161
Fuck.

150
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,662
I can't blame you though.

151
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,467
Damn Nesha, you wearing a wire?

152
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,702
(footsteps plodding)

153
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,237
On some real shit though,

154
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,873
he deserved everything he got.

155
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:21,574
(birds chirping)

156
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,610
Fuck him, really fuck him.

157
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:25,611
- Yeah.
- All right?

158
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,612
I never liked that nigga anyway.

159
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,847
That's what I'm saying.

160
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,316
Fuck him and fuck every
other bitch ass nigga

161
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:32,285
that tried to stop me from taking over.

162
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,220
(birds chirping)

163
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,253
Okay.

164
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:39,859
So seriously though, you do plan

165
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:42,128
on leaving this street
shit behind you, right?

166
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,363
Yes, when the time is right.

167
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,666
I still got some unfinished business

168
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:47,699
I need to take care of.

169
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,846
I just don't want you to
get so caught up in the life

170
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,139
that you can't even find your way out.

171
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,541
(sighs)

172
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:56,976
I know what you're saying.

173
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:57,877
I hope so Kionna.

174
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,780
Shit can flip on you really fast.

175
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,982
Look, I got everything under control.

176
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,985
We all have control until we don't.

177
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:08,921
I just need a little bit more time

178
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,891
get some things lined up for the long game.

179
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,326
I got bigger plans than this.

180
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,094
(air whooshing)

181
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,129
Just don't get caught up in the bullshit.

182
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,631
(footsteps plodding)

183
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,399
(birds chirping)

184
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,803
(footsteps plodding)

185
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,705
All right, well, this Friday,

186
00:08:25,738 --> 00:08:27,106
everything will be finalized

187
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,374
and you will officially

188
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,210
own all of Tyreke's former
legal business entities,

189
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,615
Everything that Tyreke owned

190
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:38,718
that was legit will now be yours.

191
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,654
Okay, and I shouldn't have any problems

192
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,656
with any family members or some bitch

193
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,700
he might have been fucking behind my back

194
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,193
trying to take this from me, right?

195
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:47,827
That's correct.

196
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,195
That's good

197
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,731
because I definitely don't
want any problems like that.

198
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,800
Tyreke didn't have a will in place, so

199
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:57,403
because he gave you temporary ownership,

200
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,704
when he passed away,

201
00:08:58,738 --> 00:09:01,774
everything automatically reverted to you.

202
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,743
By this Friday, it'll be official.

203
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,612
And you made sure he didn't have any kids

204
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,281
I didn't know about that could be coming

205
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,783
asking for money years from now?

206
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:14,587
No, Tyreke didn't have any
children that we could locate.

207
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,489
Okay, I didn't think he had any kids,

208
00:09:16,522 --> 00:09:18,357
but Tyreke didn't tell me so much,

209
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,626
I just wanted to clarify that.

210
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,497
No, of course, that doesn't
mean that, down the road,

211
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,366
someone couldn't file some bullshit lawsuit

212
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,736
saying that they were entitled
to some of his businesses

213
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,406
or some of the money, something like that.

214
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,284
But if something like that
should come down the pike,

215
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:38,077
I'll file a motion right
away to have it dismissed.

216
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,979
And you'll let me know first thing,

217
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:42,615
if something like that does happen, right?

218
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:43,716
Absolutely.

219
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,018
Okay, good.

220
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,988
So now the bigger question,

221
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:53,359
now that you have this
empire in the palm of your hand,

222
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,428
what do you plan on doing?

223
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,229
I'm still working on all that.

224
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,898
(sighs)

225
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,601
Are you gonna be
done with all this street shit

226
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,236
or are you still gonna be involved in that?

227
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,273
I eventually plan to cut all that out

228
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:10,309
but I do have a few
things that I still need to get

229
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:14,513
before I cut all ties
with the trap house shit.

230
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:16,849
Listen, it's not my place to say.

231
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,919
I mean, I'm your lawyer, I work for you,

232
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:24,690
but I just think it would
be wise of me to say

233
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,660
if you stay in this too long

234
00:10:27,693 --> 00:10:30,796
and eventually the heat
that came down on Tyreke

235
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,965
will eventually come down on you.

236
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,836
That's just the nature of
this whole drug game shit.

237
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,871
I mean, shit, look at the biggest

238
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,606
drug dealers in the world,

239
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,643
El Chapo, Pablo Escobar, you name it,

240
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:47,346
eventually everybody gets caught.

241
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:49,882
I appreciate your concern,

242
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,351
but understand I've got this covered, okay?

243
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:56,155
I'm not trying to make a career
out of running trap houses.

244
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,223
I'm smarter than that.

245
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,758
(scoffs)

246
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,835
Well, I'm glad to hear you say that

247
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,160
because the retirement plan

248
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,496
for drug dealers fucking sucks, okay?

249
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,730
(laughs)

250
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:08,034
Oh yeah, I know just
how fucked up it can get.

251
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:10,870
Look Kionna, you're smart.

252
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:16,242
You're smart enough to
turn this into a legal operation.

253
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,345
That way, you don't have to
worry about any of the heat

254
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,179
that would come down on you

255
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,548
from running an illegal operation.

256
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:24,884
Did you give Tyreke this same speech?

257
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,486
Well, maybe not word for word,

258
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,455
but I would definitely always try

259
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:30,990
to drive home the same point.

260
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,026
Mm-hmm, and I guess he never listened.

261
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,060
Never.

262
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:38,064
I worked with Tyreke for years

263
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,765
and would constantly try to tell him

264
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,434
to get out of this street life,

265
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,170
but he just loved it too much.

266
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,940
He just fucking loved that lifestyle.

267
00:11:47,973 --> 00:11:49,341
It was like his comfort zone.

268
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,245
Always running and
gunning, ducking and dodging.

269
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,614
He just loved that shit, man.

270
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,850
I mean, he really enjoyed it.

271
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,984
Well, this trap shit

272
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:01,120
is definitely not my comfort zone, okay?

273
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,222
And I agree with you, I'm way too smart

274
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:05,291
to be in this ship for the long run.

275
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:12,698
(air whooshing)

276
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,534
(birds chirping)

277
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,507
(paper rustling)

278
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,818
So where are we taking
the empire from here?

279
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,009
(paper rustling)

280
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,345
We need to continue
to grow this operation

281
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:29,682
and build on the areas we have locked down.

282
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:31,083
I like that idea.

283
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,052
Capitalize on everything we gotta grip on.

284
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,121
Exactly, we push more work

285
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,356
and expand into other parts of the city.

286
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,434
That ain't gonna be no problem,

287
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:39,992
(scoffs)

288
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,060
Streets already talking,

289
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,162
Queen Kionna, running shit for real.

290
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,063
(scoffs)

291
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,332
Yeah, taking out that suck ass nigga

292
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:47,733
from the South side crew,

293
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,935
exactly what we needed
to let all these niggas

294
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:51,771
know what time it is out here.

295
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,907
That, and the way you
handled that boy, Tyreke,

296
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,218
let them motherfuckers know you not the one

297
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,409
to be fucked with.

298
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,012
I think they got the
message loud and clear.

299
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:03,048
No doubt, you start zipping
up niggas in body bags,

300
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,384
ain't no way they gonna
misunderstand that shit.

301
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,653
Hey, shit had to be done.

302
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,155
I feel what you saying.

303
00:13:09,188 --> 00:13:12,691
So I told you from day
one, show no weakness.

304
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:14,093
Have you talked to Jay lately?

305
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,828
Yeah, I talked to him the other day.

306
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,496
How's he doing? He all right?

307
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,931
Yeah. He good.

308
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,809
Said he ready to get
back to putting his work in.

309
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,168
You tell him what I said?

310
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,869
Yeah, I told him what you said.

311
00:13:23,903 --> 00:13:27,139
You ain't coming back until
you 100% back to normal.

312
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,010
How long until you
think he'll be back 100%?

313
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,812
Shit, you ask him,

314
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:34,589
he ready to get back to
putting that work in now,

315
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:35,748
(laughs)

316
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,984
But I think he still
need a little more time.

317
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,428
I mean, he's still walking
around with that shit on his

318
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,520
own.

319
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:42,998
- [Kionna] Oh no.
- He fucked up for real.

320
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,891
No, I can't have no lines
with three legs out here.

321
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,528
I need him ready to go when he ready to go.

322
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,930
Oh, he gonna be good to go soon.

323
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:52,498
All right, perfect.

324
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:55,568
Look, I wanted to
bring my cousin on board

325
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,912
while Jay getting this up together.

326
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,838
Just wanted to see
what you think about that.

327
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,105
He's solid, right?

328
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,106
(scoffs)

329
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,442
Come on now, you
know me better than that.

330
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,945
I wouldn't even consider it
if he was a lame ass nigga.

331
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:07,880
What's his background?

332
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,849
He did a little work
for me back in the day,

333
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,251
but he had to leave,
but he back in town now.

334
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:15,020
I'm ready getting him back to work.

335
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,890
All right, I mean, if you
can vouch for the nigga

336
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:21,126
and he a solid soldier,
we could definitely use him,

337
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,629
especially while Jay's still out.

338
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:24,840
All right, I'm gonna hit him up,

339
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,498
let him know I got some work for him.

340
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:29,034
Well, wait, he not
on parole or probation,

341
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:29,835
or no shit like that, right?

342
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,070
(laughs)

343
00:14:31,103 --> 00:14:33,138
Oh no, he been
home with all that all shit.

344
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,141
All right, because we need
to lay low under the radar

345
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,509
from any of these cops.

346
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,611
Always.

347
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,747
I can't have no fucking
PO keeping track of nobody

348
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,415
in this operation.

349
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,926
I'm gonna give him a
call, you know what I mean?

350
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,386
Bring him up to speed
with what we got going on.

351
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,053
All right, cool.

352
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,355
Make that happen ASAP.

353
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,022
(chuckles)

354
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,657
Consider it done.

355
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,493
(paper rustling)

356
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,462
What up CUZ?

357
00:14:56,495 --> 00:14:57,897
Hey, what up nigga?

358
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,500
Shit, I talked to Kionna about
you coming to work with us.

359
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:02,067
Yeah? (Sighs)

360
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:03,636
What'd she say?

361
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:05,938
Shit, she said, if I can
vouch for you and you solid,

362
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,706
I can go ahead and put you on some work.

363
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,707
(scoffs)

364
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,309
Hell yeah, man, that's what's up.

365
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,544
Shit, I need to start stacking some bread.

366
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:13,846

367
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,824
And I told her you was

368
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:16,849

369
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:18,317

But for real, she said, you good to go.

00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,663

377
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,399

378
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,467

382
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,620
You ain't got nobody
doing this motherfucker, right?

383
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:46,345
Nah, nigga.

384
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:47,546

395
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:12,604
Yo, but for real, tell Kionna,
I appreciate the work, man.

396
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,240
Whatever she needs to get done,

397
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:18,043
just say the word and that shit is done.

398
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,478
That's what's up.

399
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,915
And like I told you the other
day we finna take this shit

400
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:24,450

401
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,719
Well, what's the first
thing you need me to do?

402
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:27,829
We gonna meet up with Jay

403
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,364
and he gonna fill you in with all the shit

404
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,022

405
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,357
All right, bet.

406
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,892
Yo CUZ, you came back
to town at the right time.

407
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,028
Shit about to get real serious for real.

408
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:38,731
Hell yeah, let's take this shit over.

409
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:39,598
(wind whooshing)

410
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:42,568
(birds chirping)

411
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:43,769
Yo, what's good bro?

412
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:44,803
What's up baby?

413
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,071
(birds chirping)

414
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,674
Hey look, this is my
cousin, Darrell, right here.

415
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:49,718
- What's up yo?
- Awesome.

416
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,943
What happened to you?

417
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,679
It's all good, just a
little bitch ass nigga

418
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:54,947
trying to take me out.

419
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,449
Yo, OPS caught you lurking?

420
00:16:57,483 --> 00:16:58,117
(scoffs)

421
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,351
Nigga, never that.

422
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:00,619
This came within the crew.

423
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,822
Shit, wasn't nothing we couldn't handle.

424
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,858
The motherfucker that did this to Jay,

425
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,793
was just plotting on some snake shit.

426
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:09,194
He's dead motherfucking now,

427
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,530
so we ain't gotta worry
about his punk ass anymore.

428
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,365
All right, enough with the chit chat,

429
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:14,566
let's get down to business.

430
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,403
(birds chirping)

431
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,506
Look, this is the plan,

432
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,708
we going to have Darrell working with you

433
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,810
till you get back to 100%.

434
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,045
All right, cool.

435
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,180
I need you to show
him all the day to day shit

436
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,482
that you do, how you watch the block,

437
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:32,451
and how you move the product around.

438
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,963
You seem like you
put in some work before.

439
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,388
(scoffs)

440
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:38,099
Yeah, I've been around the
block a couple of times, man.

441
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,334
I ain't no rookie at this shit.

442
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:40,468
Then it should be easy
to get you up on speed

443
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:42,428
in all the shit we got going on.

444
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:46,198
Jay, I need you to show
Darrell how we do the pick ups,

445
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,067
the drop offs, everything.

446
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,301
When you get back to normal,

447
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:52,604
I'ma have Darrell move
to a whole nother location.

448
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,772
(birds chirping)

449
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:56,008
So what's Kionna said
about expanding operation?

450
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,118
We taking this shit over over or what?

451
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:59,278
That's the game plan.

452
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:02,448
As we expand and take
over other areas of the city,

453
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,983
I'ma have Darrell moving
to the new positions

454
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,494
and you gonna stay with the ones you in.

455
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,487
Show me exactly how
all this shit gets done,

456
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,855
that way when the time is right,

457
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:13,659
I can just move to another
area, I'm gonna set up shop.

458
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:14,159
Yeah, no problem.

459
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:14,960
I got you.

460
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,295
I'm going update Kionna

461
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,173
let her know that y'all two
gonna be working together

462
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:20,132
until you get back on your feet.

463
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:22,301
Hell yeah nigga, let's stack this money.

464
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,838
And remember, Kionna wants heads up

465
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,806
on any possible problems,

466
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,477
whether it's cops, OPS,
or anything, all right?

467
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:33,988
So you want me to
roll with Jay right now?

468
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,347
Yeah, hang with Jay.

469
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,316
I'm gonna go meet with Kionna

470
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,551
and see what's the next move after this.

471
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,223
(birds chirping)

472
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:49,728
(footsteps thumping)

473
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,629
Oh, shit.

474
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,535
(breathing deeply)

475
00:18:56,568 --> 00:18:58,537
(birds chirping)

476
00:18:58,570 --> 00:18:59,905
Hey, excuse me.

477
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:01,907
Yeah.

478
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,309
You got the time, my cell phone down?

479
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:05,978
You're joking, right?

480
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:06,845
(laughs)

481
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,946
All right, you got me.

482
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,414
Listen, I saw a beautiful woman

483
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:11,259
and that was the first
thing I thought to say.

484
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:12,784
Yeah, that's what I thought.

485
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,987
All right, listen, at least
I was honest about it.

486
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,030
I could have kept it going,

487
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:17,456
act like my phone was really dead.

488
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,259
Oh, so you think you get
points for coming clean so soon?

489
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,994
I don't know, do I?

490
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:22,895
I gotta go.

491
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,296
All right, wait.

492
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,632
Can I just buy you lunch
for disturbing your jog?

493
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,567
I'm good, I can buy my own lunch.

494
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,102
Okay, damn.

495
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,970
Independent woman, I like that.

496
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,038
I gotta get going.

497
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,206
All right, wait.

498
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:35,783
All right, how about you
just take my number?

499
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,719
Just take my number, if
you change your mind and...

500
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:38,510
You know what I mean?

501
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:39,478
You could just text me.

502
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,280
Are you always this
persistent with everyone

503
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,381
you meet in the park?

504
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:43,491
I don't know, at this point, I mean,

505
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,059
I don't even think you would believe me.

506
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,394
- (scoffs)
- You right, I wouldn't.

507
00:19:46,418 --> 00:19:48,620
All right, how about
you just take my number,

508
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,190
if you change your mind, we can be friends.

509
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:53,192
Oh, so now you wanna be friends

510
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,536
because at first you just
wanted to buy me lunch,

511
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,728
but now we done, jump to friends?

512
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:57,596
(laughs)

513
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,599
You move fast, Mr. Whoever you are.

514
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,669
All right, I'm Davon, and you are?

515
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,103
Kionna.

516
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,540
Kionna, that is a beautiful
name for a beautiful woman.

517
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,376
Okay Davon, you can dial it down.

518
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,911
All right, so what do you say?

519
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,747
(birds chirping)

520
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,317
(air whooshing)

521
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,286
(birds chirping)

522
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:23,398
So what's the deal with your cousin?

523
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,490
He ready to come on board?

524
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,893
Shit, I already got him with Jay.

525
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,428
He ready to put this work in.

526
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:32,164
Okay, good, because we
need him to learn this operation

527
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:33,632
as quick as he can.

528
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,300
I told him we gonna be expanding

529
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:37,369
and we gonna need him
to take over new area.

530
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:41,840
Is he planning on being
with us on a long term basis

531
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:44,910
or is he just trying to make
some money real quick?

532
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:46,211
Nah, he ain't at the win,

533
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,689
he trying to grow with the operation.

534
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:51,216
All right, because we
need soldiers to grow.

535
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,293
Yeah, I talked with him a little bit

536
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,819
about what you planning on doing?

537
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,330
And what's he think about all this?

538
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:56,655
Shit, he down.

539
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,725
He said he ready to get
the real money and real work.

540
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,959
All right.

541
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,127
You talked to Jay,

542
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,329
how much more time you think he gonna need?

543
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,366
I say we give him about another week,

544
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,901
he should be ready to get
back work full time by then.

545
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,112
All right, get him on
the phone real quick.

546
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:12,404
I wanna talk with him.

547
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:17,943
Yo.

548
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,444
Yo Tray, what's up?

549
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,046
Kionna wanna holler at you.

550
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:23,915
Hey Jay, what's going on?

551
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,183
You healing all right?

552
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,818
Yeah, what's up Kionna?

553
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,420
Yeah, I'm starting to feel better.

554
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,455
Good, because we need you back out here

555
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,157
on a full time schedule,

556
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,859
but I don't wanna rush it

557
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:36,094
if you ain't ready to come back out yet.

558
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,097
Yeah, I understand what you're saying.

559
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,174
So what are you thinking?

560
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,801
You'd be good in about a week or so?

561
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:44,836
Hell yeah, no doubt.

562
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,937
I'll be ready by then.

563
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,040
Good, because I got some work

564
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,107
I need you to handle.

565
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,944
Whatever you need me to do.

566
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,223
I'm gonna have Tray give it
to you by the end of the week

567
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,750
and I'm gonna let you know
what's going on with all that.

568
00:21:58,784 --> 00:22:00,218
All right, cool.

569
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,396
What's Darrell looking like?

570
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,588
Is he a good fit for this operation?

571
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,891
Yeah, he ain't new to this shit.

572
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:07,959
He just needs to see
how we run our operation

573
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,529
and he'll be ready to
be on his own in no time.

574
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,364
All right, good.

575
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:13,965
That's exactly what I want to hear.

576
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,635
All right, look, I'ma feel
Tray in, with all the details,

577
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:20,305
he gonna get up with you by
the end of the week, all right?

578
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,406
Not a problem.

579
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:23,741
All right.

580
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,878
Yo, I'ma hit you back
a little later, all right?

581
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,950
So I got some things I gotta put in place

582
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:35,020
then I'm gonna need
Jay to handle it for me.

583
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:36,521
Shit, just let me know.

584
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:38,222
All right.

585
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,728
(crickets chirping)

586
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,865
So what took you so long to finally call?

587
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:48,133
(scoffs)

588
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,944
And I thought you had
my number blocked this long

589
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:50,968
but I guess not.

590
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,505
Is that what other chicks do to you

591
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,840
when you give them your number?

592
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,041
(chuckles)

593
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:58,710
I'd be lying if I said
it ain't never happen.

594
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,445
Should I take that as a warning sign?

595
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:03,648
I mean, maybe those chicks
can see something I can't,

596
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,585
maybe they can see that
you're nothing but trouble.

597
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,920
Nah, it ain't nothing like that.

598
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:09,788
You sure?

599
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,123
I'm positive.

600
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:11,990
All right, so what's the plan?

601
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,034
You still buying me lunch?

602
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,293
I thought you said you
could buy your own lunch.

603
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:19,264
I can, but I wanted to see if
you were a man of your word.

604
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,866
All right, I got you.

605
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,900
Yeah, I can do that.

606
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,603
The way you were talking the other day

607
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,805
seemed like you was
the one with all the bread.

608
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,141
Why you say that?

609
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,610
I don't know, it was just
the vibe you had going.

610
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:34,546
It seemed like you was
somebody who was just successful

611
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,380
and driven, I don't know.

612
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,548
Am I wrong?

613
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,751
No, it is something like that.

614
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:40,752
(scoffs)

615
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,388
Nah, it seemed like a low key flex to me.

616
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,291
No, it's nothing like that.

617
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:47,893
I was just letting you know

618
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,570
I'm not one of these dumb bitches out here

619
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,695
that's about to get excited

620
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:53,031
over a man buying her lunch like...

621
00:23:53,665 --> 00:23:54,566
All right, I got you.

622
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,810
It ain't nothing wrong with that.

623
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,569
I hope you're not intimidated by a woman

624
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,070
who can stand on her own.

625
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,273
Nah, never that.

626
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:02,483
For real, let me be honest with you,

627
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:03,775
I think it's sexy as fuck.

628
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,410
I mean, who would want a woman

629
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,112
who can't stand on her own?

630
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:10,415
How about this, meet
me in the park tomorrow,

631
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,250
I'll let you be my jogging partner.

632
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:16,788
If you can keep up with me,
I might let you buy me lunch.

633
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:18,890
- (chuckles)
- All right, I can do that.

634
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:22,093
Do what? Meet me in the
park or keep up with me?

635
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,228
Both.

636
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:25,063
- (chuckles)
- Okay, we'll see.

637
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:27,666
All right, the only thing
I need you to figure out

638
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,267
is what you want for lunch

639
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,670
because I ain't worried
about keeping up with you.

640
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:36,174
All right, don't get
too over confident now.

641
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:39,144
Nah, I just gotta good
feeling about it for real,

642
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:40,345
that's all.

643
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:41,556
All right, well, I'll text you tomorrow

644
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,315
when I'm on my way to the park.

645
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,951
All right, because I'm gonna be waiting.

646
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,519
All right, bye.

647
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,754
All right, bye.

648
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,859
So what's new in your world?

649
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:59,564
Well, I met a new guy
who seems pretty nice,

650
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,166
and girl, he fine as hell.

651
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,002
I knew something was up.

652
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:05,303
How is that?

653
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,540
You had like this, "I found
a new man," step in your walk

654
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:09,541
when you first came in.

655
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:10,909
Girl, wait, no.

656
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:14,079
So you're saying, I'm walking differently

657
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:15,313
because I met a new guy?

658
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,182
Oh well, hell yes.

659
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,518
It's written all over your face.

660
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,053
You even got a funny little grandeur smile.

661
00:25:22,087 --> 00:25:23,388
(chuckles)

662
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:24,289
(laughs)

663
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,091
Damn, is it that noticeable?

664
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,292
Of course it is.

665
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:30,195
I mean to me anyway, because
I've known you for so long.

666
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:33,231
I can always tell when you find a new man.

667
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,502
Damn, I gotta try to
make it less obvious.

668
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,205
So what's his name?

669
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:41,238
Davon.

670
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,207
Davon.

671
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,410
[Kionna] Davon.

672
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,479
He already sound like a player.

673
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:48,947
He probably got like ten baby mamas

674
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,181
running around here somewhere.

675
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,983
Well, I just recently met him,

676
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:55,353
so I'm still getting to know him.

677
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,688
Girl.

678
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,225
Okay, you will need to do
some background on his ass,

679
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,160
you are a powerful woman now.

680
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:03,528
Okay.

681
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,031
Niggas can try to plot on
you any way that they can.

682
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:09,034
He seems like a nice guy so far.

683
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:13,438
I'm pretty sure you said
the same thing about Tyreke

684
00:26:13,471 --> 00:26:16,341
and look where that ended up.

685
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,109
Okay, no.

686
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:20,979
Nesha, you know that was different.

687
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,282
I'm serious, Kionna.

688
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,752
You need to watch your every move.

689
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:30,655
You need to be careful about
who you let come around you.

690
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,757
Okay, I'll make sure

691
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,760
that he's not a serial killer

692
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,162
or some shit like that.

693
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,333
You mean to tell me
you haven't done that yet?

694
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,168
No, I just met him.

695
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:47,339
We only met once, we only
talked on the phone once.

696
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,946
Let's be honest, you have
one hell of a track record

697
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,982
when it comes to finding a man.

698
00:26:57,015 --> 00:27:00,986
No, you just always
see the worst in people.

699
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,821
I mean, come on, am I wrong?

700
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,258
(breathes deeply)

701
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,828
Okay, you know what? Okay.

702
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:13,798
Maybe the last few guys I
talked to weren't good picks.

703
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,166
I'm woman enough to admit that.

704
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,970
Okay, see, that's why
we've been friends for so long

705
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:23,975
because I can see what
you can't or maybe it's just,

706
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,711
you don't wanna see these things.

707
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,480
Look, I will get to know him

708
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:31,716
before anything gets serious with him.

709
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,385
Yes, thank you.

710
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:36,421
Please, do it for your sake and mine.

711
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:41,893
So should I hire a private
investigator for Davon?

712
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,261
Maybe have him get followed?

713
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,597
See if he's going to another woman's house?

714
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,631
(laughs)

715
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:47,942
Okay, see now you play too much.

716
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:49,000
(laughs)

717
00:27:49,034 --> 00:27:53,805
All right, I found out
all the info I can on him,

718
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,142
but really am sure he's okay.

719
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,177
(exhales sharply)

720
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,378
There you go again.

721
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:01,813
There I go again what?

722
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:05,684
Kionna, you don't know
shit about this motherfucker.

723
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,119
You already say, "And I'm sure he's okay."

724
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,522
You don't know if that's
for sure or not, do you?

725
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:12,357
Okay, no.

726
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,427
I am not 100% sure that Davon

727
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,563
is the nicest guy in the world,

728
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:21,466
but I'll do my background on him

729
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,735
and I'll see what he's about.

730
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:26,438
You probably don't
even know his last name.

731
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:29,441
I told you I just met the man.

732
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,776
I know you all too well.

733
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,079
How the fuck did I know

734
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,215
that you didn't know
this nigga's last name?

735
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,950
I'm on it, okay?

736
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:41,886
I promise, I'll get his last name,

737
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,788
I'll get more info on him.

738
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:48,259
I don't know what the hell
I'm gonna do with you girl.

739
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,293
Stop it.

740
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:52,931
I'm serious, you're too damn much.

741
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,235
(breathes deeply)

742
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,308
(car honking)

743
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:04,242
(indistinct chatter)

744
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:07,278
Well, everything's been finalized,

745
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:10,448
you officially own all
of Tyreke's businesses

746
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,851
or former businesses, I guess I should say.

747
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:16,287
Perfect, that's exactly
what I wanna hear.

748
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:20,792
Now, last time we talked,

749
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:25,196
you mentioned you were gonna get rid

750
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,733
of all the illegal trap house shit

751
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,268
and you were just gonna go legit.

752
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:32,537
I mean, you're still gonna do that, right?

753
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,772
Yeah, that's correct.

754
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,174
I plan to only do business legally.

755
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,909
I'm not trying to end up like Tyreke.

756
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,112
Now, I'm guessing
your plan is to find a way

757
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:43,815
to funnel all of the illegal proceeds

758
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:46,451
into the legal businesses, am I right?

759
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:48,453
Yep, that's the game plan.

760
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,191
Okay, because I have a guy

761
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:56,094
who specializes in that kind of thing.

762
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,829
What exactly does this guy do?

763
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:02,567
Well, technically he's
a "financial advisor",

764
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,969
but he's helped many of my clients

765
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:06,805
when they needed to transfer illegal funds

766
00:30:06,838 --> 00:30:08,807
to a legitimate business.

767
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,142
Okay, did Tyreke ever work with this guy?

768
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:14,179
No, but I always tried to get him to.

769
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,648
I mean, Tyreke was a
little bit of a hard head.

770
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,149
Sure, you knew that.

771
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,418
He always wanted to do things his way.

772
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:21,586
Or so he thought.

773
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,321
(chuckles)

774
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:23,988
(scoffs)

775
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:25,890
Yeah, or so he thought.

776
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,629
You see, Tyreke never
planned on going legit.

777
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,298
That was his biggest problem.

778
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,009
That's why he was always getting wrapped up

779
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,668
in some bullshit.

780
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:38,269
He just never wanted to quit.

781
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:41,072
Damn, that's exactly what
my mother used to tell me

782
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,340
when we were together.

783
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:44,976
I mean, it's not like I didn't try.

784
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,253
I used to talk to Tyreke all the time

785
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,547
about how he should stop
doing this trap house shit

786
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:53,918
but he just loved it and had
no intentions on ever stopping.

787
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:56,454
I guess, he was just
addicted to that life.

788
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,990
He must have been because
I would try to convince him

789
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,292
all the time to leave that life behind,

790
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,928
but he wasn't trying to hear any of that.

791
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,539
I mean, I even talked to him about this guy

792
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:08,066
I'm telling you about,
how to transfer the funds,

793
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:12,103
and he didn't want to hear
it, he just had no desire.

794
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,839
I had this guy send over some paperwork.

795
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,775
I mean, it really laid
out how it could be done

796
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,011
and he didn't even look at it.

797
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,580
Well, that sure as hell
ain't gonna be me, okay?

798
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,349
I can guarantee you that.

799
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,417
So that's why Tyreke
never worked with him.

800
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:29,387
I mean, Tyreke only
used the legal businesses

801
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,490
to circumvent money
into the banking system,

802
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,359
he never had any intention on shutting down

803
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,328
any of these trap houses
that he was running.

804
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:38,563
Okay, wow.

805
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:42,567
Well, I'm not ready to shut
down any trap houses just yet,

806
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,936
but when I do, I'm gonna
need you to contact me

807
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:47,672
with this guy, this financial advisor,

808
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,341
so I can transfer all my funds.

809
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,010
Not a problem.

810
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,078
Just let me know when
you're ready to do it.

811
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:57,348
Okay, so what else is going on

812
00:31:57,382 --> 00:31:59,450
with all these new businesses I got?

813
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:00,752
(scoffs)

814
00:32:00,785 --> 00:32:04,355
Everything's going well,
no problems to report at all.

815
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:08,593
And you haven't
received any bullshit calls

816
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:11,129
from any bitch claiming
to be Tyreke's baby mama

817
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:12,931
asking for money, right?

818
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,066
Nah, nothing like that at all.

819
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,168
Okay, good.

820
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,007
Maybe I'm looking into this way too much

821
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,843
but I gotta be honest with you,

822
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:30,381
I was a little surprised that
no one came looking for money

823
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:33,584
or any type of opportunity,
you know what I mean?

824
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,689
I thought for sure I was gonna get

825
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,424
at least one phone call about that.

826
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:43,461
I mean, somebody asking for something,

827
00:32:43,494 --> 00:32:47,432
a piece of a business
or a check for this or that.

828
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,767
So what are you saying?

829
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:54,439
I mean, again, maybe
I'm just over thinking this.

830
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,341
No, Brandon, I'm serious.

831
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:58,443
What do you think that means?

832
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,413
(breathes deeply)

833
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,016
I'm just saying be careful, okay?

834
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,753
I mean, I don't want you to be paranoid.

835
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:10,922
Hell, maybe I'm being paranoid.

836
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,558
Okay, let's say you're
not being paranoid,

837
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:16,260
what do you think is
lurking around the corner?

838
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,130
Maybe nothing at all,

839
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,833
but it almost seemed like it was too quiet,

840
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:24,602
like it was too easy or something,

841
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:28,406
almost like the calm before the storm.

842
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,143
Is there something that
gives you an indication

843
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,344
that a storm is coming?

844
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:38,016
I mean, nothing that I
can point to exactly and say,

845
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:42,320
"This is why," but I just find it odd

846
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:46,457
that no one at all came
for any of Tyreke's money

847
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:51,562
or anything at all that
used to be Tyreke's.

848
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,598
Well, I think you're over thinking it.

849
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,935
Tyreke is dead and I'm in charge now,

850
00:33:57,969 --> 00:33:59,404
and it's just that simple.

851
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,240
(chuckles)

852
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:07,478
Maybe I am, but in all
seriousness, Kionna be careful.

853
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:17,188
(birds chirping)

854
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,324
So what are these dinner
plans you keep talking about?

855
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:21,702
All right, well, I never told you,

856
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,761
but I am one hell of a cook.

857
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,930
Okay, so you can make toast

858
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:27,565
or pop something in the microwave?

859
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:30,234
Now, I bet you can make some
banging oodles and noodles.

860
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,537
Still got these jokes,
nah, some real shit.

861
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,038
I got some skills in the kitchen.

862
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,541
So let me guess, you wanna cook me dinner

863
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,943
instead of taking me to a nice restaurant?

864
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,578
You sure you're not just being cheap?

865
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,980
You still coming with these jokes.

866
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,082
(laughs)

867
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,417
All right, I'm just playing.

868
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,753
I actually think it would
be very sweet of you

869
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:49,987
for you to cook for me.

870
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,724
Yeah, well, I mean, have you
ever had a man cook for you?

871
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:58,429
Now that you mention
it, I don't think so.

872
00:34:58,463 --> 00:34:59,664
But you know I ain't talking

873
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:01,499
about just putting a
hot pot in the microwave

874
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:02,934
and then handing it to you, right?

875
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:05,203
Okay, so now you got jokes.

876
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,480
No, I'm damn near a
professional chef in the

877
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:07,572
kitchen.

878
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,307
Okay, let's not get too confident now,

879
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,042
I ain't tried your cooking yet.

880
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:12,519
I promise you, you gonna love my cooking.

881
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,513
Mm-hmm, so where'd you learn to cook?

882
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,648
I mean around the way here and there.

883
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:18,983
Okay, self taught.

884
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,852
I mean, what can I say?

885
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:22,720
I mean, I'm a fast learner.

886
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:23,855
You know what I mean?

887
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,690
Nah, but for real, my mom was a good cook

888
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,192
and I was just watching
her as a kid growing up

889
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:30,495
and it was something
that I always liked to do.

890
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,897
Okay, so this is no bullshit,

891
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,198
you really know how to cook?

892
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,734
No bullshit, I got skills.

893
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:38,669
- (chuckles)
- All right.

894
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,404
Okay, so how about this?

895
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,608
You make me your favorite meal.

896
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,177
Okay, I can make that happen tonight.

897
00:35:47,111 --> 00:35:48,146
Tonight?

898
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:49,380
Tonight, yeah, why?

899
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:52,150
You got all the plans already?

900
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:55,586
No, my schedule is clear tonight.

901
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,221
All right, cool.

902
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,789
I mean, I'll just text you my address

903
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,900
and then you just let me know

904
00:35:59,924 --> 00:36:02,460
what time is good for you to come through.

905
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,262
I think you got yourself a date.

906
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,330
All right, cool, I'm gonna be waiting.

907
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:08,332
All right, sounds like a plan.

908
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:13,638
(spoon scratching)

909
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,373
All right, listen, I gotta tell you,

910
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,142
my timing is usually a
little more on point than this.

911
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:18,843
Oh, really?

912
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:19,744
(spoon scratching)

913
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:20,954
Listen, but when you texted me

914
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,556
and said that you were
gonna be running late,

915
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,082
I turned all of the temperature down

916
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,250
on the oven and all of that.

917
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,753
Oh, so me running late is the reason

918
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:31,088
why the food isn't being done on time?

919
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,166
I mean, when you texted me

920
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,400
and said that you was running late,

921
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,359
I mean, I just changed
things up a little bit,

922
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:36,770
but honestly what I should have did,

923
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,505
I should have just left
everything the same way

924
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,573
and we could have just popped it

925
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,532
in the microwave when you got here.

926
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,835
Yeah, because maybe I
was running late on purpose

927
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,871
to see how you would handle the situation

928
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,372
Mr. Professional Chef.

929
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,540
Yeah, you say it.

930
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,576
So you telling me that you were testing me?

931
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,410
Mm-hmm.

932
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:53,720
All right, I know what it was.

933
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,355
You were in that shit
parked around the corner,

934
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,481
you was just trying to
see if a delivery man

935
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:59,550
was dropping the food off or something.

936
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:01,552
Yeah, let's go with that one.

937
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:03,120
(laughs)

938
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,289
(tense foreboding music)

939
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:09,093
(car tires screeching)

940
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:11,696
(guns firing)

941
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:22,373
(tense foreboding music)

942
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:23,841
Hey yo, what's going on Jay?

943
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:26,143
Them niggas from 18th
Street pulled on one of my spots

944
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,011
just started busing.

945
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:27,945
You know who it was?

946
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:29,256
Nah, tone said with them niggas

947
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,091
that be hanging on the
avenue at the liquor store.

948
00:37:31,115 --> 00:37:31,983
Yo, who got hit?

949
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:32,984
Lil Kev and Zaif got hit.

950
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:34,151
They're gonna make it?

951
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:36,120
I don't know, them niggas look fucked up.

952
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,823
Yo, we gotta do something
about them motherfuckers, man.

953
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:40,500
Look, I'm gonna get
on the phone with Kionna

954
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:43,227
and see what the fuck
she want us to do about this.

955
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,296
So I gotta be straight up with you,

956
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,132
if this dinner doesn't go right,

957
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:50,134
you do have a plan B, right?

958
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:50,768
(scoffs)

959
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,136
Oh, plan B?

960
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:54,181
Damn, you really don't trust
my cooking at all, do you?

961
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:57,141
I mean, I don't know you
talking about this time situation

962
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:59,043
like it's gonna be a problem.

963
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:01,545
Nah, I promise it's gonna
be fine, you're gonna love it.

964
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,281
Because we can always order pizza

965
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:04,715
if that's cool with you, right?

966
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,151
(laughs)

967
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:09,854
Nah, I promise you, you gonna love it.

968
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,055
(phone buzzing)

969
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:15,059
(tense foreboding music)

970
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:18,162
(birds chirping)

971
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,398
(sighs)

972
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,134
Sorry about that.

973
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:25,936
Oh, who the heck? Your baby daddy?

974
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,937
What? He keep track of you

975
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,272
or something?

976
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:33,110
No baby and no baby daddy,
nobody keeps track of me.

977
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,379
Yeah, all right, my bad.

978
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:38,416
It's all good.

979
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,652
(tense foreboding music)

980
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:42,686
Fuck.

981
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:47,525
She got a green light to
clip these niggas or what?

982
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:49,360
Man, she cut her fucking phone off.

983
00:38:49,393 --> 00:38:51,195
Why the fuck she do that?

984
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,497
I don't know what the fuck
she got going on right now.

985
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,899
So what's the plan?

986
00:38:54,932 --> 00:38:57,902
Are we gonna ride down on
these bitch ass niggas or what?

987
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,246
Tray, we gonna have to do something,

988
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,571
we can't let them slide on us.

989
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:04,508
(tense foreboding music)

990
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:05,943
Yeah, you right yo.

991
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:08,546
Fuck it, we gonna fix this shit right now.

992
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:10,290
I ain't waiting for Kionna to call me back.

993
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:11,482
That's right.

994
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,060
They can't shoot up
one of our blocks today,

995
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:15,586
and think they're gonna
walk away from that shit.

996
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:16,954
Let's get payback right now.

997
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,189
(tense foreboding music)

998
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,000
Yo, you know where
them niggas be chilling at?

999
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,092
Hell yeah nigga.

1000
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,469
I got one of my bitches keeping an eye

1001
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,762
on them motherfuckers right now.

1002
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:27,298
All right, let's go dump
these motherfuckers.

1003
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:30,868
(tense foreboding music)

1004
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:35,473
(dramatic ominous music)

1005
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,308
Yo, I think is one of them right there.

1006
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:38,442
(dramatic ominous music)

1007
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:40,778
Y'all stay here, I'm gonna handle this.

1008
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:41,879
(gun cocking)

1009
00:39:41,912 --> 00:39:45,416
(dramatic ominous music)

1010
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:52,656
(gunshot cracks)

1011
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,231
(dramatic ominous music)

1012
00:40:00,264 --> 00:40:01,899
(footsteps thumping)

1013
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:03,310
Yo, what the fuck did y'all niggas do

1014
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,535
without my permission?

1015
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,237
We did what needed to be done.

1016
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,037
- (sighs)
- Have you seen

1017
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,139
the fucking news?

1018
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,307
It looks like fucking a war is going on.

1019
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,243
It is a fucking war going on.

1020
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:14,812
Some niggas from 18th Street
ran up on one of Jay's block

1021
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,089
shot the whole fucking block up.

1022
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:18,382
You should have waited
till you got word from me

1023
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,017
before you made a move.

1024
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,620
I called your phone and
you shut your phone off.

1025
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,089
You still should have waited
till you got word from me.

1026
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,490
We didn't have time to wait.

1027
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:29,226
Jay had a location, we
had to make a move fast.

1028
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,696
Do you know how much heat
this is gonna bring down on us?

1029
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,698
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

1030
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:35,633
Let them niggas that did this shit

1031
00:40:35,666 --> 00:40:36,867
think it's all good?

1032
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:39,603
Yo, you know we
gotta do this the right way

1033
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:40,805
or everything gets fucked up.

1034
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:42,482
But I told you that
shit from the beginning.

1035
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:43,741
(dramatic ominous music)

1036
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,410
Then why the fuck did
you shut your phone off

1037
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,878
and you knew I was calling?

1038
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:49,380
I was gonna call you right back,

1039
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:50,381
I was in the middle of something.

1040
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:51,615
Yeah, like what?

1041
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:54,652
Getting fucked by this
new nigga you talking to?

1042
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:56,687
What the fuck did you just say to me?

1043
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,256
Ever since you've been
talking to this new nigga,

1044
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,658
yo, your head ain't been right.

1045
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,669
What? Are you jealous
because you ain't fucking me?

1046
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,261
Is that what this is about, Tray?

1047
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,696
Don't even say no dumb shit.

1048
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,364
You know it ain't nothing like that.

1049
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,675
Then what the fuck is the problem?

1050
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:10,668
Because you went over my head

1051
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:13,604
and killed two niggas
from 18th Street, period.

1052
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,506
Ki, I don't know who this motherfucker is

1053
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:18,342
you talking to, or fucking, or whatever.

1054
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,377
I don't give a fuck what y'all doing,

1055
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,712
but he got your head fucked up.

1056
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,390
You know what? I
think it might be your head

1057
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,648
that's fucked up.

1058
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,526
I've been noticing how
flashy you've been lately,

1059
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:28,028
you don't think I get calls every day,

1060
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:29,987
talking about how you run around town,

1061
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,323
flexing with all this new money you got?

1062
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,158
Who the fuck you getting calls from?

1063
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:36,527
Ain't nobody calling
you saying shit about me.

1064
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,971
You ain't think I heard about that bitch

1065
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,699
at the strip club on 49th that
you spend all your money on?

1066
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:43,000
Man, fuck that bitch.

1067
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,302
Yeah, uh-huh, so
much for staying low key.

1068
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,540
But I never not answer
when you calling me,

1069
00:41:49,573 --> 00:41:50,808
I never not pick up.

1070
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,844
Yo, I was gonna call you right back.

1071
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:56,747
Yeah, but you didn't and
I had a decision to make.

1072
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,282
Well, You made the wrong decision.

1073
00:41:58,315 --> 00:41:59,483
It's not the way I see it.

1074
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,651
- (scoffs)
- Well, now,

1075
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,587
I gotta figure out how to fix your fuck up.

1076
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:04,622
It's like that?

1077
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,524
Yeah nigga, it's like that.

1078
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:07,591
(laughs)

1079
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,593
All right, bet.

1080
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,328
You know what? Since this motherfucker

1081
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,530
is so important to you,

1082
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:14,465
won't you get him to
do my jobs from now on?

1083
00:42:14,498 --> 00:42:15,366
(Kionna scoffs)

1084
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:16,643
Because I'm done with this shit.

1085
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:19,036
Now, Tray, what the
fuck are you talking about?

1086
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,505
You are the queen, you'll figure it out.

1087
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,674
Yo, stop talking that dumb shit.

1088
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,910
For real yo, I'm done.

1089
00:42:25,943 --> 00:42:27,077
Tray.

1090
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,078
Oh yeah.

1091
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:28,946
(dramatic ominous music)

1092
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:29,780
(birds chirping)

1093
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:30,648
You might wanna get rid of that,

1094
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:32,850
there's a body on there.

1095
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:35,452
Matter of fact, get
your new little boyfriend

1096
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:37,087
to help you with that because I'm done.

1097
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,456
(dramatic ominous music)

1098
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,759
(scoffs)

1099
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:43,460
(indistinct)

1100
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,230
(footsteps plodding)

1101
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:47,131
(air whooshing)

1102
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:49,967
(birds chirping)

1103
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,472
So you know word got back to me.

1104
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,308
Oh yeah, about what?

1105
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:58,542
I heard that Tray quit.

1106
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,510
(scoffs)

1107
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:01,211
Damn, how'd you hear about that?

1108
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,681
Girl, I got ears everywhere.

1109
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:05,716
You should know this by now.

1110
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,760
- (sighs)
- Well, he made a decision

1111
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:07,685
without my okay

1112
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,153
and it turned into a problem.

1113
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:11,121
You sure it didn't have nothing to do

1114
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:13,324
with this new guy you're talking to?

1115
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:14,692
Davon?

1116
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,627
It has nothing to do with him.

1117
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,562
Tray made a decision

1118
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,431
that really fucked some things up and...

1119
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:21,465
Why would you even ask

1120
00:43:21,498 --> 00:43:23,300
about Davon like he's the problem?

1121
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:26,503
Because it seems like since
this guy's been coming around,

1122
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,172
things have been a little off.

1123
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:29,940
I don't know why you would say that.

1124
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:32,443
Everything's been the same.

1125
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:35,546
You have been acting different lately.

1126
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:36,680
Oh wow, okay.

1127
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,215
Now, you sound like Tray.

1128
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:42,186
You overlooked things that
you've never overlooked before.

1129
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,755
Tray made a decision without my okay,

1130
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,024
there's nothing I overlooked.

1131
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,792
So you're telling me that he just ran off

1132
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:49,903
and did some random ass shit,

1133
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,304
and didn't tell you nothing about it,

1134
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:53,464
and called you, didn't
text you or anything?

1135
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,199
He called me, but I was busy

1136
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,870
and he should have waited
until I called him back.

1137
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:02,272
What were you busy with?

1138
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:05,309
I was having dinner with Davon.

1139
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:06,744
Okay, see, there it is.

1140
00:44:06,777 --> 00:44:11,882
Now, you run a big empire
and you get a call from a person

1141
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:13,450
that's number two in the operation

1142
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,894
and you're too busy to take the call

1143
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:17,321
because of a dinner date, are you serious?

1144
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:20,124
It's not like I was never
going to call him back,

1145
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:23,127
I just couldn't take the call right then.

1146
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,529
(birds chirping)

1147
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:26,773
You couldn't take the call right then

1148
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:29,199
or you didn't want to
take the call right then?

1149
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,034
You know what Nesha,

1150
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,369
it's really not that big of a deal.

1151
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:35,406
It was a big deal to Tray

1152
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,542
and you weren't there
to show him how to move.

1153
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:40,144
Yeah, well he should know

1154
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:43,681
not to green light a
motherfucker without my okay.

1155
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:45,816
He had to make an executive decision

1156
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,118
and you were not there
to tell him how to move.

1157
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:53,257
He made a problem even
worse than it already was, he did.

1158
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,893
Okay, all I'm saying is that

1159
00:44:55,926 --> 00:45:00,130
I've seen how you took
what Tyreke started, right?

1160
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:04,435
And you grew it into this large operation.

1161
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:06,103
Yes I did, indeed.

1162
00:45:06,136 --> 00:45:08,105
Okay, so then don't fuck up

1163
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,107
because a guy is coming around.

1164
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,576
I'm not gonna fuck anything up.

1165
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:15,412
(birds chirping)

1166
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:23,287
(paper rustling)

1167
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:26,256
Oh my God.

1168
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,859
(engine revs)

1169
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:33,130
(table thumping)

1170
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,399
Yo, what's up Ki?

1171
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,002
What's going on, Jay?

1172
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:42,005
Just out here, making sure
that money keeps coming in.

1173
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:42,906
How's it looking out there?

1174
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:43,974
No problems, right?

1175
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:45,909
Nah, no problems.

1176
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:47,837
You heard from Tray lately?

1177
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:51,982
Not since he came through
and told me he was quitting.

1178
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,159
- (sighs)
- Listen, I'm gonna need you

1179
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:54,952
to step up in this operation.

1180
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,055
Not a problem, okay, I got you,

1181
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,490
but we gonna need more help

1182
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:03,093
because I can't run
everything without more people.

1183
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:03,761
(sighs)

1184
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:04,928
You hear from Darrell?

1185
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,932
Nah, I think he left when Tray left.

1186
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,667
Shit.

1187
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:13,070
We need to rebuild if
Tray ain't coming back.

1188
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,773
This nigga all in his feelings and shit.

1189
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:18,008
You want me to see if I
can round some people up?

1190
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,077
I probably get one or two solid niggas

1191
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,112
if we need to real quick.

1192
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:24,014
Let's hold off on that for now

1193
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,717
and see how everything plays out first.

1194
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,852
You think Tray gonna come back around?

1195
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:30,954
I don't know what the fuck he's gonna do.

1196
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:33,724
I've called him, I text
him, and his little stupid ass

1197
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:36,126
ain't even text me back or call.

1198
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,271
I could try to reach out to
him and see what his plan is,

1199
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,732
but he was fucking mad at
shit last time I talked to him.

1200
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,534
Nah, don't reach out to him,

1201
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:45,169
I want to talk to him first.

1202
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:47,671
We can't let the OPS know
we got internal problems.

1203
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,506
If they get word on any of this shit,

1204
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,574
they gonna think we weak.

1205
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,409
Yeah, I know, we can't let anybody know

1206
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:54,111
about any of this bullshit.

1207
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:57,080
These motherfuckers out
here would think we falling apart

1208
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,925
and will try to take some
of these blocks back.

1209
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:01,485
Nah, we definitely can't have that.

1210
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:02,119
Hell no.

1211
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,554
(inhales deeply)

1212
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:04,697
All right, look, I'm gonna
think about what I'm gonna do.

1213
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,156
(exhales sharply)

1214
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,659
I'll hit you back once I figure
out my next move, all right?

1215
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,394
All right, cool.

1216
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:11,829
(exhales sharply)

1217
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:14,264
Until then, just keep that
motherfucking money coming in

1218
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,233
and keep watching them blocks, all right?

1219
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,303
No doubt, I'm gonna
keep this shit locked down

1220
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,171
until you give me word on our next move.

1221
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,574
All right, cool, I'll hit you later.

1222
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:24,607
All right.

1223
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,281
What's wrong?

1224
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:33,984
You seem like you got a
lot weighing on your mind.

1225
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,420
I'm just dealing with
a lot of shit right now.

1226
00:47:36,453 --> 00:47:37,821
Like what?

1227
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,265
Some shit that you
don't care to know about.

1228
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,292
What? Like all that
street shit you got going on?

1229
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,461
Wait, what do you mean?

1230
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,097
That shit you got
going on in the streets.

1231
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,365
What do you know about that?

1232
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:49,066
(laughs)

1233
00:47:49,099 --> 00:47:49,967
Come on girl, stop playing.

1234
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,244
You think I don't know this shit

1235
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:53,103
that you got going on out here.

1236
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,138
You never mentioned it to me before,

1237
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,383
I just thought you didn't
know about all that other stuff.

1238
00:47:57,407 --> 00:47:58,876
Hell yeah, I know about all that.

1239
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,577
I even know about how Tray quit on you.

1240
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:01,745
How do you know about that

1241
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:02,989
and I never even talked to you about that?

1242
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,248
I mean, I have to.

1243
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,025
Man, you already know
that these people around here

1244
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,252
can't keep a secret to
save their fucking life.

1245
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,588
Why didn't you ever talk
to me about this before?

1246
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,557
It just never really came up.

1247
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,925
So what do you know about Tray?

1248
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:16,960
Fuck that nigga, you
don't need him anyway.

1249
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,462
Do you know Tray?

1250
00:48:18,495 --> 00:48:21,398
All I know is you don't need him.

1251
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:22,599
Do you know Tray?

1252
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:25,202
I mean, we grew up
together and all of that,

1253
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:26,403
but I mean the bottom line is

1254
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:27,804
you don't need anybody

1255
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:29,282
that's just going to get up
and bounce on you like that.

1256
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,351
I never even knew you
was in the streets like that.

1257
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,877
I'm not in the streets like that,

1258
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,779
but I do my little thing here and there.

1259
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:37,814
You sound like a real street nigga.

1260
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:40,350
I never got this
impression from you before.

1261
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:42,061
I ain't, so you know
all I've been up in like,

1262
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,621
"You is nothing like
that," but I do my thing.

1263
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,924
All right.

1264
00:48:46,957 --> 00:48:49,860
But listen, I've been meaning to ask you.

1265
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:51,361
While we on this topic,

1266
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:53,597
I need you to do me a little favor.

1267
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:54,364
(sighs)

1268
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,732
What kind of favor?

1269
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,101
All right, I need you to
help my boy move this week,

1270
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:00,046
and I wanted to ask if you
could help me with that?

1271
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,905
Wait, so you trapping too?

1272
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,316
I just really need to
help my boy real quick

1273
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,709
so that I could try to get
this extra cash, you feel me?

1274
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:07,144
So what do you need from me?

1275
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:10,480
All right, I'm going to need
you to pick up some product

1276
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,149
and the only thing is

1277
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:16,119
I might just need to
move it to your trap house.

1278
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:16,687
Pick it up from who?

1279
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,121
From me.

1280
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:20,266
I mean, I'll call you with the
date and times and all that

1281
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,125
when I get everything
finalized and all that.

1282
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:25,228
So you want me to funnel your boys' drugs

1283
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:26,563
through my operation?

1284
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,899
No, I mainly want you to
hold some weight for me,

1285
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:31,134
but I mean, if we can unload something too,

1286
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:33,503
I mean that's even better, right?

1287
00:49:33,537 --> 00:49:34,972
(scoffs)

1288
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:38,041
I mean, I guess I can make some calls

1289
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:39,743
and try to make it happen.

1290
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:41,378
I guess I can help you with this.

1291
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:42,946
I would really appreciate it

1292
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,648
if you can help me with this.

1293
00:49:44,681 --> 00:49:46,917
And this is just a one time thing, right?

1294
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,086
Absolutely, just one time.

1295
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,388
(sighs)

1296
00:49:51,421 --> 00:49:54,124
All right, I'm gonna have
to move some things around,

1297
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,059
I gotta let my crew know what's going on.

1298
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:58,362
All right, listen, but believe me,

1299
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:00,197
I really would not ask you this

1300
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:01,774
if I didn't really need
your help with this.

1301
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:03,876
I mean, I just need to make
this quick cash real quick.

1302
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,570
The problem was my boy
had offered me this opportunity.

1303
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:10,207
All right, look, I'll
make it happen, okay?

1304
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,743
All right, listen, I appreciate you.

1305
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:18,148
(breathes deeply)

1306
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,518
Yo, what's up Ki?

1307
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,954
Jay, listen, I need you
to change some things up

1308
00:50:23,987 --> 00:50:26,156
for this new side project I'm working on.

1309
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,892
All right, what do you need me to do?

1310
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:31,862
I need to help somebody move some weight.

1311
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:33,630
What kind of weight you talking?

1312
00:50:34,631 --> 00:50:38,101
Just a little something,
it's no big deal.

1313
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:41,238
So what do you need me to do?

1314
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:44,174
I'm gonna run it through
one of our trap houses,

1315
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,310
but I need to make sure that this product

1316
00:50:47,344 --> 00:50:49,513
stays separate from our product.

1317
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:53,884
All right, so you want me
to stop moving our product?

1318
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:55,118
Just for a bit

1319
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:58,055
and then we can get
back to running what's ours.

1320
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,389
Why are we doing this?

1321
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:01,591
Is something wrong with
the product we pushing out?

1322
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:06,129
No, I just need to do
a favor for someone.

1323
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:09,199
You need me to pick something up for you?

1324
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,201
No, I'm gonna handle it,

1325
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,037
I just need you to make
room for this new shit

1326
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,405
we about to get.

1327
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,340
Where are we getting this new shit from?

1328
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:19,109
Is it better quality?

1329
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:21,244
Look, you don't need
to worry about all that.

1330
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,113
All right, whatever you need.

1331
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:24,991
All right, so I'm gonna
go pick this shit up,

1332
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:26,750
I'm gonna set it at one of the traps,

1333
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:27,451
and then I'm gonna let you know

1334
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,553
what the next move is, right?

1335
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,288
Ki, are you sure you wanna be sitting

1336
00:51:31,321 --> 00:51:32,556
on a large shipment like that?

1337
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:38,328
Jay, do I need to remind you
who the fuck is running shit?

1338
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:40,831
Nah, but I'm saying, I
don't think it's good for you

1339
00:51:40,864 --> 00:51:42,399
to be holding that much weight.

1340
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:45,535
Jay, again, why do I need to remind you

1341
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:47,170
who the fuck is running this shit?

1342
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:51,374
My bad Ki, I'm just
trying to look out for you.

1343
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:53,376
Well, yeah, I appreciate you

1344
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:56,947
but you just need to
take orders, you got me?

1345
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:58,315
Ain't no problem.

1346
00:51:58,348 --> 00:51:59,926
I'll make sure we separate the new product

1347
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,950
when you tell me to.

1348
00:52:01,885 --> 00:52:04,087
All right, now I'm gonna get back at you

1349
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,589
when everything is set up.

1350
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:07,524
All right, cool.

1351
00:52:07,557 --> 00:52:10,293
(birds chirping)

1352
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:13,396
(breathes deeply)

1353
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:17,267
(paper rustling)

1354
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,536
(footsteps thumping)

1355
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:20,804
(table thuds)

1356
00:52:20,837 --> 00:52:23,707
(exhales sharply)

1357
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:28,812
Damn, that's a lot of weight.

1358
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:30,080
Yeah, listen,

1359
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,782
I really appreciate you
helping me out with this.

1360
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,117
So what's the plan?

1361
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,720
All right, listen, I might
have a buyer and if I do,

1362
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,822
I ain't gonna need you
helping me move that shit.

1363
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:41,791
You know somebody who
can buy that much product?

1364
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,293
I mean, it's not 100%,

1365
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,529
but my boy definitely
said he was good for it.

1366
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:48,532
So how long I gotta
sit on this much weight?

1367
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:50,309
Well, I'm just gonna
make a run right quick

1368
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,168
then I'll be right back.

1369
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:52,402
How long you gonna be?

1370
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:54,180
I mean, I'm just gonna
go talk to my other boy

1371
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:55,105
about this other bag.

1372
00:52:55,138 --> 00:52:57,340
But you gonna find out today,

1373
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:59,242
if you can move this shipment, right?

1374
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:01,678
Listen, Kionna, if you can't do it,

1375
00:53:01,711 --> 00:53:03,389
you just gotta let me know so I
can make other arrangements.

1376
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:05,182
No, I can help, I just wanna make sure

1377
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:06,349
you have a game plan.

1378
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:07,884
This is a lot of shit for me to hold.

1379
00:53:07,918 --> 00:53:10,420
But you said that you was
gonna help me get this bread,

1380
00:53:10,453 --> 00:53:12,231
and if you can't do it, I just
want you to let me know.

1381
00:53:12,255 --> 00:53:14,024
It's not that, I just wanna make sure

1382
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,692
you're moving things right.

1383
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:17,527
Whoa, so you think you are the only one

1384
00:53:17,561 --> 00:53:18,461
who know how to move weight?

1385
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:19,429
No, that's not what I'm saying.

1386
00:53:19,462 --> 00:53:20,964
What exactly are you saying?

1387
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,875
Look, I'm not trying to
fight about this, all right?

1388
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:25,168
I just wanna make sure
we don't have no problems.

1389
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,245
Well, just do this for me

1390
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:27,904
and we're not gonna have a problem.

1391
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:28,605
All right, fine.

1392
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:29,673
All right, cool.

1393
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:30,716
I'm about to leave, I'll be right back.

1394
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,843
And let me know as soon
as you find out anything

1395
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:34,945
or what's going on.

1396
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:36,980
You've got to chill, I got you, relax.

1397
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,086
(dramatic foreboding music)

1398
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,889
(birds chirping)

1399
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:04,407
Yeah, I need to talk to
somebody in narcotics unit.

1400
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:07,077
All right, yo, that bitch
Kionna is in the trap house

1401
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,378
on (indistinct) Street,

1402
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,747
I told you I would call if
she had a large shipment.

1403
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:13,183
She in the crib right now, holding on it.

1404
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:14,651
She got that shit inside right now,

1405
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,519
y'all fucking cops need to do your job

1406
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,921
before she move all that shit.

1407
00:54:17,954 --> 00:54:21,658
(dramatic foreboding music)

1408
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:30,967
(door thuds)

1409
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:34,738
[Police] Police department,
we got the warrant.

1410
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:35,839
Go.

1411
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:37,841
Police department, we got the warrant.

1412
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,075
Get the girl.

1413
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:45,448
(dramatic ominous music)

1414
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,853
(indistinct chatter)

1415
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:54,457
Brandon, how long until you can get me

1416
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:56,259
the fuck outta here?

1417
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:58,061
I'm working on that as fast as I can.

1418
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:01,998
Well, you need to work
faster because I can't be in here.

1419
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:05,035
I know and I'm trying
to call in every favor

1420
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:06,636
I have at the DA's office.

1421
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:08,004
Well, what's the hold up?

1422
00:55:08,038 --> 00:55:09,081
They're trying to hold you

1423
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:11,207
on what they call a no bail warrant,

1424
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,043
which means no amount of money

1425
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:15,178
that you pay can get you out.

1426
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:16,980
Why are they doing that?

1427
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:20,583
The DA is saying that you're
running a criminal enterprise

1428
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:23,520
and that you're a threat to
the community, blah, blah, blah,

1429
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:26,589
all that bullshit, just
to keep you locked up.

1430
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,792
Are you fucking serious?

1431
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,427
I'm gonna do everything in my power

1432
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:34,197
to get that no bail warrant
turned into a cash bail warrant.

1433
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,675
Well, you gotta make it happen, Brandon,

1434
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,967
because I can't be caged up in here.

1435
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:40,179
I'll find a way to make it happen,

1436
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:42,105
but it it's gonna take some time.

1437
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:44,841
What kind of time?

1438
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:48,511
Maybe a few days, maybe a week.

1439
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:49,779
Come on, Brandon, you know,

1440
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:52,048
you can make things
happen faster than that.

1441
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:54,260
I'm gonna try it but I just
don't want you to get upset

1442
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:55,552
if it takes more time.

1443
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:59,656
Call in every favor, they owe you,

1444
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,258
pull every string you need to.

1445
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:03,927
I have to get the fuck outta here,

1446
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,495
do you understand me?

1447
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,164
Yes, I understand completely.

1448
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,933
All right, make it happen.

1449
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:14,170
(indistinct chatter)

1450
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,638
Yo, what's up Brandon?

1451
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:19,109
Hey Tray, listen, I just
came from out of the jail,

1452
00:56:19,142 --> 00:56:20,410
talking to Kionna.

1453
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:22,879
Oh yeah? I heard she got locked up.

1454
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:28,084
Yeah, they're holding
her on this no bail warrant.

1455
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,387
I'm trying to get it turned
into a cash bail warrant,

1456
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,890
but the DA, she's being a fucking cunt.

1457
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:36,793
It sounds like they really
want her locked up bad.

1458
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:39,829
You think you can get her cash bail?

1459
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:42,942
Yeah, I think I can make it happen,

1460
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:44,667
but it's probably gonna take some time

1461
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,569
before I can get it finalized.

1462
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,538
That's fucked up.

1463
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,039
Yeah, it is.

1464
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:56,913
Listen, Tray, I know that you two

1465
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:59,215
are not seeing eye to eye right now,

1466
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,117
but I think it would be a good idea

1467
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:02,552
if you came to visit her.

1468
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:06,256
I don't know why.

1469
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:08,825
She said she don't need my help anymore.

1470
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:11,361
Tray, she was probably just really pissed

1471
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:12,562
when she said that.

1472
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,364
(exhales sharply)

1473
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:17,700
Look, she really needs
people on her corner right now.

1474
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:20,069
Where her new man in all this?

1475
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:20,837
Where the fuck this nigga at?

1476
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:22,705
Why he ain't coming to see her?

1477
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,217
I don't even know what his deal is.

1478
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:28,111
Kionna didn't even mention
his name when I talked to her.

1479
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:33,249
Maybe you should call him
and see if he'll go visit her.

1480
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:36,319
(exhales sharply)

1481
00:57:36,352 --> 00:57:38,822
Tray, you're like a brother to her,

1482
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,991
she really needs your support right now.

1483
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:45,061
I don't know about that, Brandon.

1484
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:47,230
(breathes deeply)

1485
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:51,601
Look, I'm just saying consider it.

1486
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:55,171
It would really help her
through this right now.

1487
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,408
I don't know, bro.

1488
00:57:58,441 --> 00:58:00,176
She be acting funny already.

1489
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:02,946
Maybe getting locked up

1490
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,248
will help clear her mind a little bit.

1491
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,051
- (scoffs)
- Shit, I don't know.

1492
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:14,691
Look, Tray, just consider it.

1493
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:17,994
(indistinct chatter)

1494
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:24,367
Yo, you Kionna, right?

1495
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,603
Yeah, how do you know me?

1496
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:27,670
- (scoffs)
- Come on girl,

1497
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:29,205
everybody know who you are.

1498
00:58:30,106 --> 00:58:31,106
Really?

1499
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:35,945
Hell yeah, they call you
the queen of the trap house.

1500
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:37,447
Who's they?

1501
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,250
Everybody who's anybody in the streets.

1502
00:58:40,283 --> 00:58:41,150
- (scoffs)
- Man, that's probably

1503
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:41,918
why I'm in here.

1504
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:44,087
Too many people know who I am.

1505
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:49,692
People in here know who you are too.

1506
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:51,060
What's that supposed to mean?

1507
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:54,964
You know Tyreke's
cousin is here too, right?

1508
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:57,400
I don't even know who Tyreke's cousin is.

1509
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:58,401
(scoffs)

1510
00:58:58,434 --> 00:59:00,470
She damn sure know who you are.

1511
00:59:00,503 --> 00:59:01,704
Why you say that?

1512
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,641
Because she talking mad shit already.

1513
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:07,677
Man, what do this dumb
bitch out here saying?

1514
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,445
She's saying, first chance she gets,

1515
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:10,880
she gonna fuck you up.

1516
00:59:11,848 --> 00:59:14,517
I ain't worried about no bitch in here.

1517
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,653
They say she crazy as shit, man,

1518
00:59:16,686 --> 00:59:18,821
you might have to handle that bitch.

1519
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:20,757
What's her name?

1520
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:23,593
Vena.

1521
00:59:23,626 --> 00:59:26,663
Vee? I ain't never even heard of her.

1522
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,665
Hey, I'm just trying
to give you a heads up

1523
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:30,533
because she's supposed to be moving

1524
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,068
into this swing of the jail soon.

1525
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:35,705
Do you really think
she's gonna be a problem?

1526
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:38,308
Hell yeah and she crazy as fuck

1527
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:39,909
and she talking shit.

1528
00:59:42,045 --> 00:59:44,647
When are they supposed
to move her at this wing?

1529
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:45,782
(exhales sharply)

1530
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:48,117
I don't know, but I'm sure it's soon.

1531
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:51,054
Usually when they hear that they move in,

1532
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:52,255
it's shortly after.

1533
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:55,558
All right, well, thanks for looking out.

1534
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,993
No problem.

1535
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:59,529
Shit, I don't like the bitch, no way.

1536
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:02,532
I can't wait to see
somebody fuck her ass up.

1537
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:03,800
(scoffs)

1538
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:05,501
(indistinct chatter)

1539
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:06,636
What's your name?

1540
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:10,106
Tiona, but they call me Tee.

1541
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:13,209
(indistinct chatter)

1542
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:16,713
(birds chirping)

1543
01:00:16,746 --> 01:00:17,580
Yo, what's up, Tray?

1544
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,881
What's going on, Jay?

1545
01:00:19,816 --> 01:00:21,517
I guess you heard about Kionna, right?

1546
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:22,852
Yes, fucked up.

1547
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:24,463
I told her not to be
holding that much weight

1548
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:25,688
at one time.

1549
01:00:25,722 --> 01:00:26,990
Oh, but wait.

1550
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:28,601
She called me and told
me she was gonna move

1551
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,194
a large shipment and she
need me to keep the new product

1552
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,029
separated from the rest.

1553
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:36,466
Man, she knows she not
supposed to hold that much work

1554
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:38,434
at the same time.

1555
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,602
I don't know.

1556
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,037
The fuck is she thinking?

1557
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,305
I bet it got something to do

1558
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:44,140
with the new nigga she fucking with.

1559
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:45,217
That nigga trapping or something?

1560
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:47,543
I don't know what the fuck he do,

1561
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:48,787
but I know she ain't been acting the same

1562
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,014
ever since this nigga came around.

1563
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:52,915
That's why the fuck I had to bounce.

1564
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,151
She act different when this
motherfucker come around,

1565
01:00:55,184 --> 01:00:58,254
she don't act the same,
don't talk the same, nothing.

1566
01:00:58,287 --> 01:00:59,455
Yeah, she different bro.

1567
01:01:00,556 --> 01:01:02,325
Yo, I bet this got something to do

1568
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:04,093
with this motherfucker, Davon.

1569
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,596
Who else would she be
doing something like this for?

1570
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,107
She would've never
done no shit like this.

1571
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:11,167
If I was around, I'd have
talked some sense into her.

1572
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,802
I tried to tell her it was a bad move,

1573
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:15,638
but she wasn't trying
to hear shit I was saying.

1574
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:16,506
Where is this nigga, Davon?

1575
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:17,774
Nobody seen him nowhere?

1576
01:01:17,807 --> 01:01:19,676
Nah, that motherfucker is like a ghost.

1577
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:21,110
Ever since Kionna got locked up,

1578
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:23,379
you can't find this motherfucker nowhere.

1579
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:26,215
Yo, this nigga suspect
and a motherfucker, man.

1580
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:27,417
That's what I'm saying.

1581
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:28,951
This nigga sideways, bro.

1582
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:30,853
I've been seeing that.

1583
01:01:30,887 --> 01:01:34,457
Yo, I wouldn't be
surprised if he set Ki up.

1584
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:38,227
(birds chirping)

1585
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:40,729
What we gonna do?

1586
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:44,867
I ain't doing shit, that's
not my business anymore.

1587
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:47,336
Tray, she needs your help bro.

1588
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:52,875
I know she do, but
she said she don't need it.

1589
01:01:53,843 --> 01:01:55,020
She might got her mind fucked up,

1590
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:56,479
she not thinking straight.

1591
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:00,483
Look, I'm not saying I'ma help,

1592
01:02:01,417 --> 01:02:03,319
but if I was, first thing I'd do

1593
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:06,222
is find out where that nigga Davon at.

1594
01:02:06,255 --> 01:02:09,058
(birds chirping)

1595
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:16,099
(indistinct chatter)

1596
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:30,446
So any word that they got me a cash bail?

1597
01:02:31,814 --> 01:02:33,249
I'm still working on it.

1598
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,686
(breathes deeply)

1599
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:38,421
Brandon, come on now.

1600
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:41,333
I know you don't wanna hear me say this,

1601
01:02:41,357 --> 01:02:44,227
but these things take time and the DA,

1602
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,931
that fucking bitch is really pushing back.

1603
01:02:48,965 --> 01:02:51,234
She has got it out for
you, I don't know what the...

1604
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:54,637
It's like she has this obsession with you.

1605
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:57,173
She's a fucking cunt, is what she is,

1606
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,075
but that's neither
here nor there, that's...

1607
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:00,343
We'll talk about that later.

1608
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:01,511
(clears throat)

1609
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:04,380
And she's really doing
everything in her power

1610
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:05,148
to try to keep you in here.

1611
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,382
She's being a fucking bitch,

1612
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:09,285
I don't know why she
has it out for you so badly.

1613
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:12,388
(indistinct chatter)

1614
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:16,626
Well, do whatever the fuck you need to,

1615
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:17,960
to get me outta here.

1616
01:03:20,596 --> 01:03:22,198
I will, I'm on the phone constantly

1617
01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:24,467
with people over there
trying to get things to happen.

1618
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,735
Okay.

1619
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:26,779
I'm working day and night

1620
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,371
trying to make this thing happen.

1621
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:29,404
Good.

1622
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:34,143
There's something else I need to tell you

1623
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:37,613
and I'm still trying to get
more information on it,

1624
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:41,250
but I think this is a little
bit of a bigger problem.

1625
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:42,284
What is it?

1626
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:46,656
(exhales sharply)

1627
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:49,625
I'm getting word for my
sources at the DA's office,

1628
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,594
that this was not an investigation

1629
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:53,229
that was started by them,

1630
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,599
this came from somewhere else.

1631
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:58,466
Meaning what?

1632
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:02,371
Someone called this in.

1633
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:06,943
Are you fucking kidding me?

1634
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,545
Someone tipped off the police

1635
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,614
that you were holding a
large amount of narcotics

1636
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:16,886
or allegedly holding a
large amount of narcotics.

1637
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,422
Can we find out who it was?

1638
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,258
No, not yet,

1639
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:24,794
but is there anyone that would've known

1640
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:26,605
you had that much
weight on you at that time?

1641
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:30,166
Someone who would've
wanted you to go down for this?

1642
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,370
(indistinct chatter)

1643
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,013
(exhales sharply)

1644
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:47,316
(indistinct chatter)

1645
01:04:50,286 --> 01:04:52,989
Are you sure that's what really happened?

1646
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:54,790
My sources are good.

1647
01:04:54,824 --> 01:04:57,026
They always give me good intel.

1648
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:00,329
(indistinct chatter)

1649
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,636
Does this help or hurt my defense?

1650
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:11,040
Well, when I was referring
to this being a bigger problem,

1651
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:14,110
I was actually talking about
someone within your crew

1652
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:15,411
planning against you.

1653
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:19,282
However, in regards to your case,

1654
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,251
this actually might help your case.

1655
01:05:23,886 --> 01:05:25,021
How will it help?

1656
01:05:26,455 --> 01:05:29,392
If we can find anything
wrong with that search warrant,

1657
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:32,561
anything at all, we can
file a motion for dismissal.

1658
01:05:33,896 --> 01:05:37,833
Okay, good, all right,
that's what I want to hear.

1659
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:39,211
I'll have my staff at the office

1660
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:42,138
going over every single
piece of that search warrant.

1661
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,040
(exhales sharply)

1662
01:05:44,073 --> 01:05:47,109
Just let me know if you
find anything we can use.

1663
01:05:49,512 --> 01:05:50,512
Absolutely.

1664
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:54,650
(exhales sharply)

1665
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,819
(scoffing)

1666
01:05:56,852 --> 01:06:00,122
(indistinct chatter)

1667
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:09,098
(birds chirping)

1668
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:13,369
Hello.

1669
01:06:13,402 --> 01:06:15,338
Let me guess, you need to talk to me

1670
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:18,007
because you need me
to go (indistinct) Kionna.

1671
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,278
Tray, Kionna is in a really
fucked up situation right now

1672
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:25,081
and she needs your help
to get her out of all this shit.

1673
01:06:25,114 --> 01:06:27,149
Yo, everybody keeps saying that,

1674
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:28,985
but y'all need to understand,

1675
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:30,553
y'all need to be talking to her.

1676
01:06:30,586 --> 01:06:31,287
She the one who said

1677
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,022
she don't need my help anymore.

1678
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:35,424
She was just upset, okay?

1679
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:37,460
She needs you now more than ever.

1680
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,763
Man, how's she doing anyway?

1681
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:43,899
I've seen her the other day,

1682
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:45,501
she doing as good as she can.

1683
01:06:47,136 --> 01:06:48,347
[Tray] Do you think she
gonna be able to beat the case

1684
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,673
or she gonna have to
do some time behind this?

1685
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:54,877
She said that Brandon is
working on trying to get her

1686
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:55,910
out.

1687
01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:58,481
It's fucked up and I feel bad for her,

1688
01:06:58,514 --> 01:07:00,149
but Jay told me she was holding weight

1689
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:02,551
she wasn't supposed to be holding.

1690
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:03,628
I think this got something to do

1691
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:05,121
with that nigga named Devon.

1692
01:07:06,422 --> 01:07:09,358
Yeah, anybody ever find out
where the fuck that nigga at?

1693
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:12,428
I haven't seen or heard from him.

1694
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:17,666
I tried to tell her, she
wasn't trying to hear me.

1695
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,536
I told her something wasn't
right with that motherfucker.

1696
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:23,773
She started fucking with
this nigga, Davon, and it's like,

1697
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:25,374
she forgot how the game work.

1698
01:07:27,076 --> 01:07:29,311
Okay, and see that's why she needs you.

1699
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:32,081
You would've been able to
see this shit from mile away.

1700
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:34,693
Yo, this shit would've never happened

1701
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:35,717
if I was around.

1702
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:38,087
You need to really go see her, okay?

1703
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,855
She would be glad to see you

1704
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,757
and it would really lift her spirits.

1705
01:07:43,426 --> 01:07:45,861
That's even if she want to even see me.

1706
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:47,163
She does.

1707
01:07:47,963 --> 01:07:48,798
(scoffs)

1708
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:50,266
Why? How do you know?

1709
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:52,435
Because she asked about you already.

1710
01:07:53,269 --> 01:07:55,371
All right, I'll think about it.

1711
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,272
(clicking)

1712
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:59,408
Tray, you need to really go see her,

1713
01:07:59,442 --> 01:08:01,744
it will really lift her spirits up.

1714
01:08:02,945 --> 01:08:06,482
All right, I'll see what I can do.

1715
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:09,218
(birds chirping)

1716
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,152
It will really give her hope

1717
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:11,821
if you went to go see her, man.

1718
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:16,392
(indistinct chatter)

1719
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:21,230
So how did it go with your lawyer today?

1720
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,898
Did you get any good news?

1721
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:23,833
(exhales sharply)

1722
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:25,077
He said he may have something

1723
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,204
to help me get the fuck
outta here or something.

1724
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:30,473
So you might be getting out?

1725
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:33,609
It's not definite, but
he's working on it, so.

1726
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:37,179
That's good, because that bitch Vena

1727
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:38,614
is still talking shit.

1728
01:08:38,647 --> 01:08:40,783
Yo, you really think I'm
worried about that bum ass

1729
01:08:40,816 --> 01:08:42,017
bitch?

1730
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:45,020
I'm just saying the
bitch is fucking crazy.

1731
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:47,123
I wish some stupid whole ass bitch

1732
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:49,258
would press me in this motherfucker.

1733
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,961
Hey, I'm not saying that
you can't handle your own.

1734
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:54,263
Then what is you really saying?

1735
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:57,166
I'm just saying, bitch is
always looking for something

1736
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:58,667
to poke somebody up with.

1737
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:02,304
Yeah, I appreciate the heads up

1738
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:03,606
but I ain't even thinking about

1739
01:09:03,639 --> 01:09:05,708
these pussy ass bitches right now.

1740
01:09:06,876 --> 01:09:07,943
(breathes deeply)

1741
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,545
Let me show you something.

1742
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,721
What the fuck?

1743
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:27,897
Yo, how long you been
keeping that in your mouth?

1744
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:28,797
(chuckles)

1745
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,332
I keep it in every day.

1746
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,203
You ever used it while you was in here?

1747
01:09:34,236 --> 01:09:36,505
Hell yeah, you never know.

1748
01:09:37,773 --> 01:09:39,775
Yo, you fucking crazy.

1749
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:42,077
How the fuck is that
not cutting your mouth?

1750
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:43,145
(laughs)

1751
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:46,182
It takes practice, but it's not hard.

1752
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:49,451
(indistinct chatter)

1753
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:53,355
I ain't never seen no shit like that.

1754
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:57,760
Well, I guess Tyreke
didn't teach you that, did he?

1755
01:09:57,793 --> 01:10:01,030
Nah, because I ain't even
heard nothing like that before.

1756
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:06,368
Nah, I got a couple of extra
ones, so I could teach you,

1757
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:08,069
you never know.

1758
01:10:09,905 --> 01:10:11,106
Shit.

1759
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:14,977
(indistinct chatter)

1760
01:10:15,010 --> 01:10:17,613
(engine revs)

1761
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:25,588
(paper rustling)

1762
01:10:25,621 --> 01:10:26,722
Wait a minute,

1763
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,262
son of a bitch.

1764
01:10:34,129 --> 01:10:35,831
I think I just found the loophole.

1765
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:36,699
(table thuds)

1766
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:37,366
(laughs)

1767
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:38,234
(claps) Yeah.

1768
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:39,101
(footsteps thumping)

1769
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:42,404
(indistinct chatter)

1770
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,676
(footsteps thumping)

1771
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:50,312
(engine revs)

1772
01:10:56,352 --> 01:10:58,520
District Attorney, Ellis.

1773
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:01,924
Brandon, what can I help you with?

1774
01:11:01,957 --> 01:11:03,535
Did you have a chance
to review the paperwork

1775
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:05,494
I sent over to your office today?

1776
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:09,064
I had an opportunity to look over it.

1777
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:13,435
Okay, so you would
agree that the search warrant

1778
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:16,038
is no good and Kionna
needs to be let outta jail?

1779
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:19,508
I believe we should
present it to the judge

1780
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,010
to see what he says about it.

1781
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:23,045
(exhales sharply)

1782
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:25,681
Are you really gonna make
me go through all of that?

1783
01:11:25,714 --> 01:11:28,350
Kionna is a problem in this community.

1784
01:11:30,386 --> 01:11:32,855
Even if the search warrant is invalid,

1785
01:11:32,888 --> 01:11:34,556
she's still running narcotics empire.

1786
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:39,061
Listen, if you can't prove
that, you can't say that.

1787
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:41,030
(laughs)

1788
01:11:41,063 --> 01:11:42,564
I did prove it.

1789
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:44,833
She was ascertained with
large amounts of narcotics

1790
01:11:44,867 --> 01:11:46,068
on her during the raid.

1791
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:48,704
Yeah, but you don't have any of that

1792
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:50,939
because the warrant was no good.

1793
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,976
Brandon, we both know what she's up to,

1794
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:55,553
we both know that she
orchestrated the murder of.

1795
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:56,645
Tyreke

1796
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:59,615
and is now running his drug operation.

1797
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,617
Look, you can't prove

1798
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:04,920
she had anything to do
with Tyreke being killed.

1799
01:12:04,953 --> 01:12:05,954
(laughs)

1800
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:08,857
Just like that, she'll
be charged with murder.

1801
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:14,530
Jessica, get off your high horse,

1802
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,832
you have bigger problems
in the city than Kionna,

1803
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:17,866
you know that.

1804
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:18,701
Oh really?

1805
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:19,878
Were you aware that she was planning

1806
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,404
to be the biggest drug kingpin in the city?

1807
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:23,839
(exhales sharply)

1808
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:25,383
Can't you just drop all the charges,

1809
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:26,785
so we don't have to
go in front of the judge

1810
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:28,877
and we don't have to go through all that?

1811
01:12:30,612 --> 01:12:33,949
Oh, I see, you want me
to make your job easier

1812
01:12:33,982 --> 01:12:35,351
so you can let Kionna out

1813
01:12:35,384 --> 01:12:37,319
and she can completely take over

1814
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,389
all illegal drug operations in the city.

1815
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:42,558
You can't just do me a solid?

1816
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:46,595
There is a war brewing
in the streets of this city

1817
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:48,697
and it's all because of Kionna.

1818
01:12:50,566 --> 01:12:51,800
At least with Tyreke,

1819
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:54,136
he wasn't trying to take over everything.

1820
01:12:56,739 --> 01:13:00,542
The streets of the city
will be stained with blood

1821
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:01,877
if she gets out and has her way.

1822
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:07,149
She is power hungry and
will do anything to get it.

1823
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:09,151
(chuckles)

1824
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:11,162
Jessica, I think you're
being a little dramatic.

1825
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:12,020
(scoffs)

1826
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,021
Am I?

1827
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:13,689
(exhales sharply)

1828
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:15,891
Just sign the damn papers.

1829
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:20,929
I won't be responsible for the hell

1830
01:13:20,963 --> 01:13:23,532
she's going to unleash in the city.

1831
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:26,835
(footsteps plodding)

1832
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:28,871
(air whooshing)

1833
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:31,774
(exhales sharply)

1834
01:13:34,376 --> 01:13:37,646
(indistinct chatter)

1835
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:54,229
Hey Kionna, can you hear me?

1836
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,532
Yeah, I can hear you.

1837
01:13:57,733 --> 01:13:59,835
Okay, listen, I just got
the paperwork signed

1838
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:02,671
by the judge, he's gonna
be dismissing the case.

1839
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:06,842
Finally, I can get the fuck outta here.

1840
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:09,678
Yeah, it should just be a couple hours.

1841
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:11,389
They gotta do the
paperwork at the courthouse,

1842
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:12,757
they're gonna send it over to the jail,

1843
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:15,484
and then I'm gonna have
somebody come pick you up, okay?

1844
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:18,187
So what'd you do to
get the case dismissed?

1845
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,488
The warrant was no good.

1846
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:22,090
There were so many
discrepancies and technical issues

1847
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:23,525
with that warrant.

1848
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:25,661
The judge had no other
option, but to throw it out.

1849
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,865
So he basically got the
case tossed on the technicality?

1850
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:32,801
Yes, that's exactly what happened.

1851
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:38,273
That's the best news
I've heard in a long time.

1852
01:14:39,842 --> 01:14:41,743
Okay, look, I'll catch up with you later

1853
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:43,979
when you get out, once you get settled in,

1854
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,281
we just need to go over a
couple little business issues,

1855
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:48,417
some legitimate business issues.

1856
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:49,852
All right, sounds good.

1857
01:14:51,353 --> 01:14:54,823
(indistinct chatter)

1858
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:57,259
Shit, I know you happy as hell

1859
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:58,994
to get up out of this place.

1860
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:00,095
- (scoffs)
- Hell yeah.

1861
01:15:01,396 --> 01:15:03,632
Man, did they tell you how long it'll be

1862
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:04,900
before you're released?

1863
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:06,835
They just need to finish up some paperwork

1864
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:08,170
and I'll be out this bitch.

1865
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:12,508
I can't wait until I get
out of this motherfucker.

1866
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:14,543
What they saying about your case?

1867
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:17,546
I got this bullshit ass public defender,

1868
01:15:17,579 --> 01:15:18,579
so you know how that go.

1869
01:15:19,648 --> 01:15:22,184
I mean, I can't even get a
hold of this motherfucker.

1870
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:24,520
Yeah, and what was
they saying about your case

1871
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:26,221
the last time you talked to him?

1872
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:30,726
He said I should be out in a few months,

1873
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:34,763
but that's only if I don't
get into any trouble.

1874
01:15:34,796 --> 01:15:38,500
All right, well, just lay low,
stay off everybody's radar

1875
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,701
and you'll be fine.

1876
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:42,204
Unless a bitch tests me

1877
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:46,174
because I'm gonna have
to do what I have to do, shit.

1878
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:49,978
But when you do get out, hit me up,

1879
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:52,948
I could use somebody like you on my team.

1880
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:53,715
For real?

1881
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:55,150
Yeah, for real.

1882
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:57,586
Look I got big plans to expand my operation

1883
01:15:57,619 --> 01:16:00,122
and I'm gonna be
looking to add to my roster

1884
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:01,657
if you know what I mean.

1885
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:03,692
Shit, I'm definitely down with that.

1886
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:05,127
I'm definitely down with that.

1887
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:08,630
Well, I'm gonna definitely
take you up on that offer.

1888
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:11,166
All right, cool, because I'm gonna run

1889
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:15,637
this whole motherfucking
town, best believe that.

1890
01:16:15,671 --> 01:16:17,806
(indistinct chatter)

1891
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:20,075
Hell yeah, I'm with that.

1892
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:23,178
(indistinct chatter)

1893
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:29,051
(air whooshing)

1894
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:31,887
(birds chirping)

1895
01:16:40,028 --> 01:16:41,330
(car door thuds)

1896
01:16:41,363 --> 01:16:43,341
And I didn't think you'll
be the one to pick me up.

1897
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:45,801
Yeah? I was in the area.

1898
01:16:45,834 --> 01:16:47,202
Why didn't come see me?

1899
01:16:47,235 --> 01:16:48,270
(scoffs)

1900
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:49,271
Because you was on some dumb shit.

1901
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:50,339
(clicking)

1902
01:16:50,372 --> 01:16:51,873
Yeah, like you wasn't either.

1903
01:16:52,808 --> 01:16:54,185
I don't know what you talking about.

1904
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:55,209
- (scoffs)
- Yeah, okay.

1905
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,614
And I told you that nigga
Davon was a problem.

1906
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:00,983
Here you go, I knew it was coming.

1907
01:17:01,817 --> 01:17:03,719
I'm just saying, I told you so.

1908
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,322
All right, look, we good?

1909
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:10,759
I mean...

1910
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:11,827
Tray, for real.

1911
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:12,694
I'm saying it though.

1912
01:17:12,728 --> 01:17:13,795
We good?

1913
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:16,698
- (exhales sharply)
- Yeah. We good?

1914
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:18,367
(clear throat) Yeah, we good?

1915
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,401
All right, good.

1916
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:21,803
Now, speaking of Davon,

1917
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:24,506
you've seen that
motherfucker around anywhere?

1918
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:27,042
Nope, he was like a fucking ghost,

1919
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:28,877
vanished as soon as you got locked up.

1920
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,413
Yeah, we need to find his bitch ass,

1921
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:32,714
pay his pussy ass a visit.

1922
01:17:33,815 --> 01:17:36,451
I already got Jay and
Darrell on top of that.

1923
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:37,595
Just give me a little more time,

1924
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:39,254
we gonna find where he laying at.

1925
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,223
All right, good.

1926
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:45,326
You ready to go?

1927
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:47,696
Yeah, let's go.

1928
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:50,732
(birds chirping)

1929
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,470
(engine revving)

1930
01:17:58,240 --> 01:17:59,751
Yo, I'm gonna run
around the corner real quick,

1931
01:17:59,775 --> 01:18:00,609
I'll be right back.

1932
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:01,743
All right, cool.

1933
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:06,591
(dramatic foreboding music)

1934
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:07,449
(birds chirping)

1935
01:18:07,482 --> 01:18:10,752
(footsteps plodding)

1936
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:28,170
Get the fuck over
here and open this door.

1937
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:31,205
Come on.

1938
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:35,342
Yeah.

1939
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:41,349
(hinges squeaking)

1940
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:45,530
Yo, how fuck did you get outta jail?

1941
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,422
You don't sound so happy to see me,

1942
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:48,757
you little snitch bitch.

1943
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:50,258
Shut the fuck up.

1944
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:50,992
- (scoffs)
- So this

1945
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:52,494
was just all part of your plan?

1946
01:18:52,527 --> 01:18:55,497
I bet you one of them South
side niggas we didn't get to.

1947
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:56,364
(chuckles)

1948
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:57,499
Nah, try again bitch.

1949
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:58,834
Who the fuck are you with?

1950
01:18:58,867 --> 01:19:00,745
You really thought Tyreke's
people wasn't gonna come

1951
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:03,572
for your ass after you had Tyreke killed?

1952
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:05,941
How are you connected to Tyreke?

1953
01:19:05,974 --> 01:19:08,110
Tyreke is my cousin.

1954
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:08,877
Oh, shit.

1955
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:10,378
Yeah, oh shit.

1956
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:12,190
You thought I was one of
them nice motherfuckers

1957
01:19:12,214 --> 01:19:13,749
that you see jogging in the park?

1958
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:14,859
What the fuck do you want?

1959
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:16,051
I want everything.

1960
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,186
Everything you took for Tyreke and Denmore.

1961
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:20,388
Do you think my crew
is gonna let that happen?

1962
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:21,790
I don't give a fuck.

1963
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:24,493
If them niggas don't fall in
line, I'm lay all them down.

1964
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:27,763
You kill me, you won't
make it out of this city alive.

1965
01:19:27,796 --> 01:19:30,198
- (scoffs)
- Oh yeah? Watch this.

1966
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:35,003
(hinges squeaking)

1967
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:37,072
Hey, yo, Ki.

1968
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:41,376
(dramatic ominous music)

1969
01:19:52,754 --> 01:19:54,389
Bitch ass motherfucker.

1970
01:19:56,324 --> 01:19:59,327
You want me to finish this
bitch ass nigga off for you?

1971
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:02,397
(panting)

1972
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:09,871
I told you, you wouldn't
make it out of this city alive.

1973
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:12,007
Hey Davon, you know what happens

1974
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,942
when you come for the queen,

1975
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:16,511
it's off with your motherfucking head.

1976
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:20,081
(dramatic ominous music)

1977
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:21,883
You know what?

1978
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:24,286
I think it's only right

1979
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:26,021
that I send this nigga straight to hell

1980
01:20:26,054 --> 01:20:28,190
with his pussy ass cousin, Tyreke.

1981
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:31,059
Hell yeah, show this motherfucker

1982
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:33,361
what happens when you fuck with the queen.

1983
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:35,597
(tense sinister music)

1984
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:38,433
(gunshot cracks)

1985
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:43,438
(tense foreboding music)

1986
01:21:55,877 --> 01:21:59,481
(dramatic sinister music)
