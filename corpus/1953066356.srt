1
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,231
Much better.

2
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,503
I know you're in there somewhere.

3
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:59,077
There are two things I always
tried to believe but couldn't.

4
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:03,448
One was that there's a perfect man
waiting out there for every woman.

5
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:06,960
The other was that true love
gives you happiness.

6
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:11,471
In real life,
I spent so many years dodging...

7
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:14,459
men who were so much less than perfect.

8
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:19,965
And when I did fall in love,
happiness never came.

9
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:24,369
So, I grew up and put away
those childish things...

10
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,154
and finally stopped
holding my breath for a man.

11
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,624
No!

12
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,471
What can I get for you tonight?

13
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,107
Tequila. For everyone.

14
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,910
911 Operator Six.
Is this an emergency?

15
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,979
- Yeah.
- Has there been an injury?

16
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,816
- There's a guy hurt in the street.
- A serious injury.

17
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,185
Yeah, bad.

18
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:29,354
Is he conscious?
Is he still breathing?

19
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:33,258
- I don't know. He's still alive.
- Okay, what is your location?

20
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,260
Santa Monica and Formosa.

21
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:38,463
- And were you involved in the accident?
- No.

22
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:41,400
- Did you witness anything?
- Nothing.

23
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,752
Your name, please?

24
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,093
I got her.

25
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,202
- Tomas has 11 polo ponies.
- Wow.

26
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:26,204
- Al thoroughbreds.
- That is nothing, really.

27
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:29,641
Roz, what's with you?
You haven't said a word all night.

28
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:33,712
Can I get you something?
A pill? An aspirin?

29
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:38,362
No. Would you let me out?
I want to check my truck.

30
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:46,057
- I hope you are feel better.
- Oh, she'll be fine.

31
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:49,694
So, do you use on of those little
whips on the little horses?

32
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:53,878
Well, that depends.
If you like that, yes.

33
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,719
God, American men are so boring,

34
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,357
and Latin men have a certain
mystique, a sensuality, a...

35
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,560
How do you say
'Je ne sais crois" in Portuguese?

36
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:26,598
Latin Americans enjoy their life.
About that, there can be no doubt.

37
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,246
Ole!

38
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,640
Ah, look, everybody,
I gotta get going.

39
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,276
We should really get going too.

40
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:41,546
Oh, yes, we're going dancing.
Would the two of you like to come?

41
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:46,217
Well, I don't know.
I really have to go home,

42
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,888
...but could you walk me
to my truck?

43
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,592
I had to park down the street,
and it's a bad neighborhood.

44
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,275
- It's my pleasure.
- We'll drive you.

45
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:02,214
- I gotta go potty first.
- I'll go with you.

46
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,637
Let me help you.

47
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,819
- Mmm, gracias, senor, por favor.
- Of course.

48
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,981
- Don't bother.
- No. It is my pleasure to help you.

49
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,983
You're ill.

50
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,802
You know, uh, you're
very attractive to me.

51
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:25,690
Not tonight, Tomas.
Bad timing.

52
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,726
Another night?

53
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,695
What about Brigitte?

54
00:10:30,696 --> 00:10:34,048
- I think she wants me for my money.
- Ah.

55
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,705
I'm listed. R. Willoughby.

56
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:44,183
The "R" for "Rosalyn. "
On Sycamore.

57
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:48,013
Forget it.

58
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,815
There are at least 20 girls in line.

59
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,224
Let's try the little boys' room.

60
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:22,826
Formosa.

61
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:42,000
Map of the world.
Asia.

62
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:46,912
China? Taiwan.
Formosa. Formosa.

63
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,989
I'm in love with a Chinese chick.

64
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:24,546
I have something to tell you.

65
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:42,821
- Yeah?
- Buenos dias, Rosalyn.

66
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,173
Who is this?

67
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,775
Could this be Tomas?

68
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,423
- What?
- Something's changed.

69
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:21,059
You sound different.

70
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:24,708
- How?
- It's your tone.

71
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,532
What's her name?

72
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,834
I don't know.

73
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:32,243
You've pictured her... finally!

74
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,407
And you know I don't believe any
of that stuff about Dad's vision...

75
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,543
and goin' off to find Mom.

76
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,547
Your own grandfather picked me
out of a crowded streetcar.

77
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,751
Knew I had a mole on my back,
even though I was wearin' a coat.

78
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:51,122
Yeah, but you know, maybe it was
easier to believe back then.

79
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:54,993
Ohh. Why don't we play
the Verdi now?

80
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,778
That oughta shake somethin' loose.

81
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:29,227
- Here's the wine list.
- Grazie.
- You know I have rules.

82
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:33,398
- I insist we go dutch.
- It makes me very happy
to be generous to a woman.

83
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,968
And it makes you very happy to have
a woman feel obligated later.

84
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,737
No, no, this is not true.

85
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:42,307
You are a feminist, yes?

86
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:46,422
I've just had some men
take advantage of me in the past.

87
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,982
So, what does make you happy?

88
00:15:50,983 --> 00:15:55,353
- You'd laugh if I told you.
- No, really.

89
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,355
Well,

90
00:15:57,356 --> 00:16:01,539
my passion is... abstract art.

91
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:05,997
- Wonderful! A collector.
- Oh, I wish.

92
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:09,400
It just means a lot to me.

93
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:13,004
You must be very sensitive.

94
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,356
I am.

95
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:22,046
Oh, my! That's wonderful.
What's it say?

96
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:25,616
It says,
"Welcome, great love. "

97
00:16:25,617 --> 00:16:30,989
Then again, it might say somethin'
about acupressure. I'm not sure.

98
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,859
Try one of these tamales.
I don't know,

99
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,730
you might be eatin' one on that
Great Wall they got out there.

100
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:42,166
I'm going to Formosa, remember?
It's an island. There's no wall.

101
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,969
Shut up and taste it.

102
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,652
Oh, your daddy would love
to see you today.

103
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,610
You know, he saw your mother
in a vision...

104
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,246
and drove all the way
to El Paso to find her.

105
00:16:55,247 --> 00:16:57,648
So I have been told...

106
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:00,952
about 5,294 times now.

107
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,755
Let me see her again.

108
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:07,301
Well, I filled
the hair in on that one.

109
00:17:09,134 --> 00:17:10,232
And this one,

110
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:12,130
she's thinkin' up somethin'
really fantastic in her head.

111
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,900
I didn't really know how
to express it aside from
blowin' stuff out of her head.

112
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:19,103
Easily, this is
the closest approximation of...

113
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:23,841
This one's got a lot of character,
but she doesn't look Chinese.

114
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:26,693
Tomas, I didn't know
you were so funny.

115
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,649
- You seem so...
- Yes?

116
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,352
Sophisticated.

117
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:37,762
Really? Well, yes.

118
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:44,729
So, Rosalyn, I want you
to be watch me play.

119
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,700
- Polo.
- Sure, polo. This Sunday,
I play the polo in Palm Springs.

120
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,203
Well, I'd love to see you ride,

121
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:55,773
but, right now,
I have car problems to deal with.

122
00:17:55,774 --> 00:18:01,079
Can you believe what new brakes cost?
It's all the driving we do in L.A.

123
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,092
I think I must take you
to pick up your car.

124
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:08,753
- Tomas, you're such a gentleman.
- Hey.

125
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:13,724
You know what? The shop is right
near my favorite art gallery.

126
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:16,661
I will take you
to see a wonderful painting.

127
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,912
- Come on. Let's go. Chop, chop.
- Yes.

128
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,626
Whoa, dig it!
Clap the hands!

129
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:53,364
- Hello, children. Love it.
- Danny, sweetheart.

130
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,467
Boys, there's somethin'
I gotta tell you.

131
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,569
I'm going to China.

132
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,705
- Oh.
- Right.

133
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:04,809
Rumor has it that somebody I'm
gonna know for a very, very long time...

134
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,811
lives in Taiwan, China.

135
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,813
Have a look.

136
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,582
I know what you're gonna say:
She doesn't look Chinese.

137
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,652
You realize she's supposed to have
two matching eyebrows.

138
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,897
This is just an approximation.
Actual size and shape may vary.

139
00:19:17,898 --> 00:19:20,057
Oh, man, she's diverse.

140
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:23,094
Somethin' tells me this chick
likes a bowl, man. I guarantee you.

141
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:28,266
She's a bit odd, but if this
is the woman you're supposed
to be with, then...

142
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,035
You're just gonna have to
get used to her.

143
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:36,254
Yeah, buddy. She's the one.

144
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:44,348
It is very... powerful.

145
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,350
There's a world in there.

146
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,620
A complete world.

147
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,156
Yes.

148
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:54,358
Hello.

149
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,227
Hi, Phillip.

150
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,863
- I'm sure you remember me.
- Of course.

151
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,965
It would seem remiss
if you didn't come in.

152
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,100
But I don't believe
I know this gentleman.

153
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:06,971
- Tomas De Leon.
- My pleasure.

154
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:11,587
- I can't stop thinking
about this painting.
- Few can.

155
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,561
- He's good.
- Yes.

156
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,883
You have an eye.
I can tell.

157
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,918
No, no.
I'm a polo player.

158
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,487
- I play number three.
- Really. Oh.

159
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:29,193
It's very underrated, but I think
it demands the best strategy.

160
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:32,029
- You know polo?
- Oh, a little.

161
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,000
Just because those
who appreciate polo...

162
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:41,072
also appreciate great art.

163
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,721
I'm learning great art at her hand.

164
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:52,250
This is fascinating to me.

165
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:56,053
You, at first meeting, seem
such a very tough woman.

166
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:59,440
Now, at this painting,
you are as an innocent.

167
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,127
I think I must buy
this painting for you.

168
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:07,732
Absolutely not. Tomas!

169
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,301
- I could never accept that.
- I must insist.

170
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:14,872
Tomas, I don't know you.
You don't know me.

171
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:19,989
- This is something I want to do.
- This painting is $14,000.

172
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:06,624
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

173
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,239
And this is for...

174
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,099
God, you never stop, do you?

175
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,705
Well, unlike you girls, I do have
other uses for the opposite sex...

176
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:23,057
than cash.

177
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:28,646
Oh, Roz, don't you trust me?

178
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:32,883
I do it for you, Phillip.
You'd freak if I didn't count it.

179
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,386
- We're good together, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

180
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:38,723
Did you see the nail-down?
It was a thing of wonder and beauty.

181
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:41,659
When you gave me that one look,
like I could have a shot at you?

182
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,896
Oh, that was a moment.
The testosterone was flowing!

183
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:49,467
He had to kick my ass. He had to buy
the painting. He felt good about it.

184
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:52,002
God bless testosterone.

185
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:56,040
Fourteen grand. Fourteen grand.
Hey, I almost peed in my pants.

186
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:59,343
- I thought it was supposed to be seven.
- I smelled fourteen.

187
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:02,146
Good nose.

188
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:06,050
Hey, listen.
You're really, really somethin'.

189
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,853
- I mean, I...
- Oh-ho-ho, forget it.

190
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:12,623
You're a breath away from blowing
a fine professional relationship.

191
00:23:12,624 --> 00:23:16,670
Oh, come on.

192
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,646
Hey, you break my heart,
I gotta find a substitute, you know?

193
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,790
So go fetch.

194
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:41,118
Excuse me.

195
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,596
Nice to meet you.

196
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,194
You're just worrying about
closing that Tomas kid.

197
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:51,896
Forget it.
You'll breeze him.

198
00:23:51,897 --> 00:23:56,512
Mmm, oh, I keep having
these dreams.

199
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,637
Keep thinking about...

200
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,572
green.

201
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:04,356
Ivy.

202
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:08,946
I'm lying in some ivy,

203
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,060
and I feel like a little girl...

204
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,388
and then I don't know
what happens.

205
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,323
It's probably nothing.

206
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,325
Oh, I keep waking up...

207
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:25,076
with this, like, warm,
peaceful feeling,

208
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:30,668
and then I realize who I am and
where I am and it all runs away.

209
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:35,573
Before I met Raouf, I had a dream
about a Persian in a Mercedes.

210
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,708
Now there's every girl's fantasy.

211
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:41,812
Now, Roz, don't knock it.
He became my second husband
for eight glorious months...

212
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,515
before we split
under very lucrative terms.

213
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:47,651
Marrying them for their money
seems so old-fashioned.

214
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:52,022
Sometimes old-fashioned works.
That's why it was in fashion
for so long.

215
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:57,528
Do you ever think you could, like,
meet someone and fall in love...

216
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,097
and marry them for love?

217
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,333
Oh, God, Roz, really.

218
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,702
It does happen.

219
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:08,973
Have you ever known anyone to actually
be in love for longer than 90 days?

220
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:12,376
You? Your mother? Aunts?
Girls you grew up with? Anyone?

221
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:16,914
It's impossible, and perfectly
good women attach themselves
to pigs for an eternity...

222
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:19,850
on the basis of 90 days
of hormonal imbalance.

223
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:24,788
- It's not that dark.
- Money, connections,
real estate, gene pool,

224
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:26,824
short life expectancy.

225
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,460
Those might be reasons.
Not love.

226
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:34,498
But don't you ever just want to,
I don't know, lose control?

227
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:36,800
I just want to meet a man
who knows what he wants,

228
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,152
not what you get him to want.

229
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:43,574
Yeah, for a night.
Maybe a week.

230
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:47,545
- It would wear.
- Yeah, I guess.

231
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:51,399
What's wrong with you?

232
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:57,187
Oh, I have to do
that close tomorrow, and...

233
00:25:57,188 --> 00:26:00,891
All for seven lousy bills.
That doesn't last me a couple of months.

234
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:05,596
You'll do fine.
Are you sure you're feeling okay?

235
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,265
Mmm, still breathing.

236
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:13,037
That's all that matters.
Now do good, and remember:

237
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,423
They always deserve it.

238
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,635
Hello, my dear.

239
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,938
Oh, Tomas, what nice roses.

240
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:23,741
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

241
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:27,277
- And you look so nice.
- But you are not ready.

242
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,115
I tried to tell you on the phone
I feel just horrible tonight,

243
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:33,417
but I still want to see you.

244
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:38,022
I thought maybe we could stay
here and order in? Watch cable?

245
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:41,525
Well, of course.
I will take care of you.

246
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:43,527
Thank you.

247
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:46,864
Ah! There is your beautiful painting.

248
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:50,267
- I love it so.
- Yes, it looks so fantastic here.

249
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:53,270
Thank you again for buying it for me.
It was so extravagant.

250
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:58,042
It was my pleasure to spend
a great deal of money on you.

251
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:02,446
Yeah. What do you want to eat?
And this time, you must let me pay.

252
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,848
- I have no preference.
- How about Japanese?

253
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,793
Japanese food builds your natural
antibodies. I've been reading that.

254
00:28:11,956 --> 00:28:15,092
- Tokyo Garden.
- Hello? Hi. I'd like to place an order.

255
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,161
Yes, ma'am.

256
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:20,864
A number 7,
a number 14.

257
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,333
- A California roll.
- Address, please?

258
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:26,270
- 247 South Sycamore.
- Sycamore.

259
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,272
- That's right.
- Right away.

260
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:30,624
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

261
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,527
Tomas, I'm sorry.
I told you I don't feel well.

262
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:40,417
Forgive me. I am carried away.
You're ill.

263
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:43,235
- Yes, I am.
- Let me help you.

264
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:48,873
You know, I'm achy all over.
I just want to sit on the couch.

265
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,039
Can I get you something?
A pill?

266
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,469
Aspirin. It's in the cabinet
in the bathroom.

267
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,771
Right away.

268
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:03,123
You will feel better.

269
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,188
I do not see it.

270
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:21,725
I must have left it
in the bedroom. I'll get it.

271
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:24,873
No! No.

272
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,613
" Now what?"

273
00:30:00,097 --> 00:30:01,614
"Solid facts about AIDS"

274
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,518
"Que..."

275
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,804
You found it.

276
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:45,609
- My bedroom is such a mess.
- I did not think so. You are sick.

277
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:50,123
It's so wonderful
that you're here tonight.

278
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,884
I need someone here.
I really do.

279
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,687
I'm so sorry you are sick.

280
00:30:56,688 --> 00:31:00,691
I've been praying that someone
like you would come into my life,

281
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:04,995
and then I met you
and no matter what I said,

282
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:08,232
you insisted on buying that painting.

283
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:13,003
I can't believe somebody
could care about me that much.

284
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:16,139
You must need someone too.

285
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,911
I'm sorry. I forgot, uh,
I need to make a phone call.

286
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:23,263
It's on the desk.

287
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:38,295
Hello, Eduardo? I received
a message from you that
there is something wrong?

288
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:42,633
What it is wrong? There has been
a break-in at the house?

289
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:46,937
This is outrageous! I must go back
to Buenos Aires tomorrow.

290
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:51,724
I must leave now, I guess, and talk
to the police about my belongings.

291
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:54,478
Yes.

292
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:58,662
- Yes, I will leave now.
- What's wrong?

293
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:17,759
You speak English?

294
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:22,189
You're very beautiful.

295
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:27,358
Will you come to America with me?

296
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:39,656
What I know is sketchy.

297
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:44,061
I know he's not too old,
and the family money comes
from the gas and oil business.

298
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,263
Texas.

299
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:49,066
I know that he owns
several shopping malls,

300
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:53,937
and, um, he's getting into high-tech,
interactive something or other.

301
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,573
Oh, yeah.
He's eccentric and odd...

302
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:59,576
in a thoroughly uninteresting way.

303
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:02,312
Does he save his toenail clippings
like the last one?

304
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,681
I'm sure it's something like that.

305
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:07,784
I tried to get out
of this court date. I can't.

306
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,820
We'll give you the next one,

307
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:14,891
and this way, you get your cut
and don't have to get
within groping distance.

308
00:33:14,892 --> 00:33:18,176
Ooh.
No, right?

309
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:23,109
- Or maybe.
- Oh, that's fabulous.

310
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,553
So what's the play?

311
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:34,111
It's like this.
Texas boys like their girls "purty."
Big hair, lots of makeup.

312
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,780
Oh, honey, they just love makeup.

313
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:40,031
They're my specialty,
after Persians.

314
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:44,421
Can't be that hard.
He's a man; I'm a woman.

315
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:48,458
You act like they bore you;
they chase you.
You seem to like 'em; they leave.

316
00:33:48,459 --> 00:33:52,362
It's not that it's hard.
It's just the better the play,
the better the back end...

317
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,805
and the more money
for you and moi.

318
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,001
Well, what's his name?

319
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:00,203
It's the one thing I don't know.

320
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:04,141
Elaine!
I'm renegotiating.

321
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:06,410
My setup wouldn't give it to me,
okay?

322
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:10,213
He's like, paranoid.
Look, it took three boring dates...

323
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,917
at subpar restaurants just to get
that much from the loser.

324
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,055
And I had to eat
fried zucchini twice.

325
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,525
Plus, I had to let him
give me a back rub.

326
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,827
It was heinous.

327
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,696
Your guy is gonna
be here on business...

328
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:30,948
and he always wanted to meet
an L.A. gal.

329
00:34:31,836 --> 00:34:34,838
First time he says "Howdy, darlin',"
I'm gonna hurl.

330
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,674
Where'd you say he was from?

331
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,510
Oh, I don't know.
Some Spanish name.

332
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:44,414
San something.

333
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,468
But remember one thing...

334
00:34:47,926 --> 00:34:49,986
you have to sleep with him early.

335
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,923
Just once. But make sure
you nail him early.

336
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,059
- It's important.
- I don't do that.

337
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,595
What do you mean, you don't do that?

338
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:03,541
It's just once. Just turn off
the lights and think of Tiffany's.

339
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,487
Your knee... it's bleeding.

340
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:16,575
Flight 1955 from Los Angeles
to Taipei has been delayed.

341
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,249
Excuse me, ma'am.
May I borrow this for a moment?

342
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,551
I got her.

343
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:44,287
Yeah. I'm right outside.

344
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:47,257
Yes. Will you stop worrying?

345
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:51,394
How many rich, young,
eccentric, pathetic Texans...

346
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,973
can be in the Formosa
on a Tuesday afternoon?

347
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,402
Hey, bud? Where's your phone at?

348
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,338
- That way, around corner.
- Thanks.

349
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,707
You a Texan?
How you doin'?

350
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,543
Oh, can't complain.
Hopin' my date shows up.

351
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,545
- Same here.
- Where you from?

352
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:12,716
- San Antonio.
- Ah, good deal. San Angelo.
Trav Maltzberger.

353
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:14,784
- Fletcher McBracken.
- Pleased to meet you, Fletcher.

354
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,786
- Likewise.
- See you around.

355
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,138
All right.
Have a good day.

356
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:24,127
Damn.
Excuse me, sir.

357
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,863
I was wondering
if you have seen this woman.

358
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,265
- No.
- No?

359
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:32,802
- How 'bout this woman?
- Nope.

360
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:36,673
It's actually the same woman,
but does this look familiar?

361
00:39:36,674 --> 00:39:40,143
No, huh? It could be this one.
It could be any one of these.

362
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:44,013
No. Are you related
to this woman?

363
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:49,152
Uh, actually, well, not quite
yet exactly, but I was hoping...

364
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:51,187
Sorry.

365
00:39:51,188 --> 00:39:56,440
- Cuervo?
- No, iced coffee with a straw, please.

366
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:07,286
Hi.

367
00:40:11,475 --> 00:40:13,676
Do I know you?

368
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,179
I think so.

369
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,531
Maybe?

370
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:22,152
Are you here to meet someone?

371
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,505
- Yes, ma'am.
- So am I.

372
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:30,434
I'm thinking it could be you.

373
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:33,746
Yeah?

374
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,499
Are you from Texas?

375
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,385
Sure.

376
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:43,321
Well, here I am.

377
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,881
This... I'm sorry.
This is a little odd for me.

378
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:55,518
Oh, listen. It's okay. Don't...
Don't read anything into it.

379
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,888
I... I was just on my way
over from the west side,

380
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:02,158
and I thought you might need
a welcome-to-L.A. drink.

381
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,171
Thank you very much.
That's very, very friendly of you to...

382
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:11,607
Um... My God, you're so familiar to me.

383
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:17,613
- I'm Roz.
- I'm Fletcher.

384
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,883
- Well! It's great to meet you.
- Well.

385
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:30,286
- I'm just on my way to the marina.
- You're leaving?

386
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:33,690
I just had time
to pop in. I just...

387
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:36,726
It's so nice to meet
a man from Texas.

388
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:41,130
Wh-What if I'm full of surprises?
If you leave, you might miss 'em.

389
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:43,982
I'm not surprised by much.

390
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:48,180
You can't go.

391
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,850
We have a lot to talk about.

392
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:59,490
Well, I guess I could make a call.

393
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:07,490
Yeah.

394
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:09,492
- Elaine.
- Roz!

395
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:12,495
Hi. I'm hung up here.

396
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,764
You got him?

397
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,233
I think so.

398
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:22,605
I'll catch up to you later.
I really want you to see this
new painting I'm working on.

399
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:25,719
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

400
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,662
I'm all yours.

401
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:35,218
- Anyway, this is Sycamore Avenue.
- Uh-huh.

402
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,570
I live just back there.

403
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:44,561
- Beautiful trees.
- Mmm, pretty.

404
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,363
They lose their leaves.
That's how we know it's winter.

405
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:51,649
- I wonder what kind they are.
- Oh, they're sycamore trees.

406
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:56,139
I get it. Sycamores.
Sycamore Avenue.

407
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,141
I'm learning things
from you already.

408
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,610
I must be the man
you're waitin' for.

409
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:04,293
I know all these useful things about
the names of trees and the like.

410
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:12,989
Hey, look up.
No, keep walkin'.

411
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:17,776
Take my arm. It's kind of scary, sort of
like jumpin' with your eyes closed.

412
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:31,874
So did I hear you say
somethin' about a painting?

413
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:34,077
- Yes. I paint.
- Mm-hmm.

414
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:37,714
- I'm one of those starving
artists you hear about.
- Really?

415
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,149
I-I'd love to see your work.

416
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,420
- You like art?
- Oh, yeah! Um...

417
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:49,225
I, uh, I'm an artist.
I stack rocks.

418
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:53,496
- Really?
- Yeah. They're these, um, cairns...

419
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,474
these monument kind of things.

420
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,936
What you do is,
you get a bunch of rocks,

421
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:02,219
and you stack 'em up...

422
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,548
and you cram stuff
in the cracks...

423
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:08,511
and it's like a work of art.

424
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:11,114
- Do you want to see?
- Sure.

425
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,466
Come here.
Sit down.

426
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,621
Well, first things first.

427
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:21,591
First I'm gonna have to get my Elvis
rock-stackin'swamp mojo lined up here.

428
00:44:21,592 --> 00:44:24,794
We-ell.

429
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,203
And I'm gonna need your hand.

430
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,380
# Ta-da

431
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,649
It's beautiful.

432
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,186
See, I made it,
but I didn't make it.

433
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:26,823
I mean I didn't make
the rocks, but...

434
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:30,369
I arranged them
according to this moment.

435
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:35,775
And... And the shape of your hand
informed the way that it grew.

436
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,719
Look at it.

437
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:45,475
- I see it.
- I mean really.

438
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:49,712
Look at it. See, it's got kind of
a shape in there...

439
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:53,483
that goes down and then around, and
if you look at it with one eye maybe,

440
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:56,152
you can see a face.

441
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:58,731
Maybe some lips or some eyes.

442
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:04,239
Well, say good-bye.

443
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:08,881
Couldn't last forever.

444
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:12,869
No.

445
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,551
Well, uh,

446
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:20,576
why don't you tell me
about San... whatever?

447
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:24,521
- San Antonio.
- San Antonio.

448
00:46:24,748 --> 00:46:26,916
Is it nice?

449
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:28,918
Is it nice?
Yeah, it's nice.

450
00:46:28,919 --> 00:46:33,363
It's, uh, well, it's
its own world, really.

451
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:37,026
Every time I leave there and
I come back, I get the feeling...

452
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:42,165
that I'm comin' back to somethin' that
I haven't discovered anywhere else.

453
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:45,902
It's, uh, it's kind of hard to
explain in words, really. It's...

454
00:46:45,903 --> 00:46:49,639
It's like an old woman who's lived
long enough to know who she is.

455
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:53,409
You know?
There's ghosts there.

456
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:57,113
I mean really, there are,
and if you listen, you can
hear them at night partying,

457
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:59,649
...havin' a great old time.

458
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,451
- Sounds amazing.
- Well, most people who go there...

459
00:47:02,452 --> 00:47:04,954
would probably just see
the mini-malls,

460
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:08,024
the potholes in the streets
and a lot of lawns that need waterin',

461
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:10,059
but the really cool stuff's
hidin' out.

462
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,275
I mean, you really
have to know where to look for it.

463
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:16,098
Well, I like it here.

464
00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:18,347
It fits you.

465
00:47:18,896 --> 00:47:20,837
Is that like an insult?

466
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,266
Uh, no, it isn't. I'm just...

467
00:47:23,267 --> 00:47:25,865
I don't think L.A. fits me.
I just said I like it.

468
00:47:25,866 --> 00:47:28,427
Well, I like it too.

469
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:32,515
So, I guess
you're here on business.

470
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:36,886
Well, actually, I was, uh,
I was goin' to China,

471
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:39,355
but I decided
to stay here instead.

472
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:41,958
Oh? That makes no sense to me.

473
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:46,629
Well, let's just say that there
really wasn't any reason for me to go.

474
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:50,233
I guess you're really worried about your
business, being out of the country and all.

475
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:53,703
Oh, not really. My grandmother's left
in charge of that. It'll be all right.

476
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:57,106
- That's unusual.
- Well, no, she's not senile or anything,

477
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:59,822
but she's quit
playin' jazz lately...

478
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:03,720
No!

479
00:48:04,648 --> 00:48:06,999
Are you okay?

480
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:09,819
Now I know
why I don't walk in L.A.

481
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:13,422
- Your knee.
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

482
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:15,774
It's bleeding.

483
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,681
Oh, my God.

484
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:27,784
- What? I...
- It's so weird that you did that.

485
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,640
What? I just...
Is your knee okay?

486
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:35,177
- Why did you do that?
- I don't know. I just did it.

487
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:37,780
- Why did you do that?
- I just... I did it.

488
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:41,690
Is there...
Is there somethin' wrong?

489
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:46,739
Nothing.

490
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,561
I'm not in China.
I'm in Los Angeles.

491
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:55,231
Los Angeles? What happened?

492
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:59,468
Well, I found her!
She's here.

493
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:04,440
You found her!
Is she a California girl?

494
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,809
Yes, ma'am.

495
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:10,646
- Does she like you?
- Well, I... That's the... Um...

496
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:13,215
It's kind of hard to figure.
The way she talks,

497
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,451
I get the feelin'
that she knows me or somethin'.

498
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,621
- Sounds kind of odd to me.
- Well, it's like they say...

499
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,457
life is full of surprises.

500
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:25,504
So, is she Chinese?

501
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,060
Operator. May I help you?

502
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:01,831
Hello?
May I help you?

503
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:03,899
Oh, no, there's...
We're...

504
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,343
Nothing. Thanks.

505
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:42,338
- Operator. City of listing?
- Hollywood.

506
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:46,308
- The Roosevelt Hotel.
- Please hold for the number.

507
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:50,312
Area code 213-55...

508
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:53,582
Hello.

509
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:56,798
Uh, hi. Roz?

510
00:50:57,521 --> 00:51:01,203
- Who's this?
- Fletcher.

511
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:05,928
Oh. Hi. How are you?

512
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:08,130
I'm good.
How... How are you?

513
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:10,666
- How did you get my number?
- I dialed 411,

514
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:14,403
...and, um, I said a cross street...
Sycamore and Willoughby.

515
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,772
They gave me the number.
They were really helpful.

516
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:19,975
Um, look, Fletcher,
I'm just on my way out the door.

517
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:21,977
I was wondering if
I could persuade you...

518
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,814
I'm-I'm going to meet
a friend at the Formosa.

519
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:27,349
Just a minute. Listen.
There's somethin' we need to talk about,

520
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,853
...about you fallin' down
and hurtin' your knee.

521
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:35,291
We- We should get together and...
and talk about this.

522
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:37,560
- It's important.
- You could meet me there.

523
00:51:37,561 --> 00:51:40,378
Oh... Yeah, good.

524
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:44,584
Shit.

525
00:51:46,236 --> 00:51:48,678
I'll do that.

526
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:59,715
- This guy has money.
- Stacked.

527
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,717
- He doesn't walk like it.
- I know. That's the problem.

528
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:04,420
Hey, Fletcher.
You made it.

529
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:07,089
- This is my friend Phillip.
- Hey.

530
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:10,601
- Hey, Fletcher. Sit down.
- Thanks.

531
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:13,229
So,

532
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,264
Roz says that
you're from Texas.

533
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:17,266
San Antonio.

534
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:21,370
I drove through Texas once, fast.
It took forever.

535
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:23,973
Oh, it's... it's a drive.

536
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,742
Yeah. Just out there on the 10 east,
you know what I mean?

537
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:30,179
You just drive, and then you run
into all that weird shit.

538
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,282
They're all out there
in their mobile homes.

539
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:38,053
Fletcher's on his way to China.
He just thought he'd hang out
in L.A. for a few days.

540
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:40,489
Oh, yeah? China? Cool.

541
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:44,126
Actually, my travel plans changed.
I got some bad information.

542
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:48,264
Had to cancel my trip.
I, uh, figured rather than...

543
00:52:48,265 --> 00:52:52,168
headin' back to my double-wide, I'd
see what the big city could teach me.

544
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,436
Cool.

545
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:57,448
I'm missin' somethin'
I think I can find here.

546
00:53:00,143 --> 00:53:03,145
- So, what do you want to drink?
- A beer would be great. Thanks.

547
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:05,247
- Philip? Another?
- Hey.

548
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:07,724
You boys stay put.
It's my treat.

549
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,856
- So how long have you known Rosalyn?
- Oh, God, since, uh,

550
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,525
we went to Parsons together,
an art school.

551
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:22,384
But she's the artist. I manage a
gallery, do some consulting. East Coast.

552
00:53:22,385 --> 00:53:24,767
Mmm. Yeah. Yeah, she mentioned
that she painted.

553
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:28,103
Yeah, she's killer.

554
00:53:28,104 --> 00:53:30,906
Very, very private.

555
00:53:30,907 --> 00:53:33,475
Totally... primal.

556
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:38,847
Kind of Klee meets Rousseau, in a femme,
West Coast vein, you know what I mean?

557
00:53:38,848 --> 00:53:43,686
Yeah? Well, she's about to happen...
major happen. She just needs a break.

558
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:46,522
Yeah?
She's somethin' special.

559
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:51,206
Yeah. We've known each other
for a long time now.

560
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:56,098
More than lovers, really.
Partners.

561
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:59,201
- Oh. Mm-hmm.
- Well, drink up, boys.

562
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:03,572
There might be a giant, fiery
meteor headed right for us.
Don't leave any in your glass.

563
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:06,709
A meteor? Hell, if there was
a meteor comin',

564
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:11,757
I'd get me a reclinin' chair and
make sure I had one of them
drinks with a little umbrella.

565
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:16,819
Right. Good to go.

566
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,022
- Come on, baby. Bring it on.
- You ready to end it all?

567
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:24,934
Well, if you're goin',
I'm goin'.

568
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,764
Oh, Fletcher.

569
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:32,534
You are positively gloomy.

570
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:37,039
It must come from hangin' out with all
those prairie dogs.

571
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,076
May I ask you a question, Phil?
And you don't have to answer it
if you don't want to.

572
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,712
D... Do you think that...

573
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:47,316
every last thread of intelligent life
is chosen to huddle...

574
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,752
in either New York or L.A.?

575
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:52,488
Or do you really believe...

576
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:55,658
that... that this
soulless sinkhole...

577
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:58,527
has anything to do
with real-life humanity,

578
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:03,365
namely, integrity,
compassion, dignity?

579
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:06,402
You know what? Don't answer that, Phil.
Let me just give you some advice.

580
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:10,939
Next time you're drivin' through
Texas, you better stay clear
of all the trailer parks,

581
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:14,176
and if you are drivin' through Texas,
why don't you do it fast?

582
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:17,222
Real, real fast.

583
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:27,837
Well, I've had fun.

584
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,669
Fletcher.

585
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:38,879
Would you take me home?

586
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:45,307
Whoa! Great place.

587
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:47,989
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

588
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:54,450
- Are these yours?
- Just some prints I'm studying.

589
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:57,086
- Yeah?
- I don't keep my own work lying around.

590
00:55:57,087 --> 00:56:01,190
- I'm in kind of a down period right now.
- Uh-huh.

591
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:04,076
You must be... You must be
pretty serious about this.

592
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:10,532
My next project is a sort of
performance-art touring piece
I've been working on.

593
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,435
I've been trying to get a grant,
but it's impossible.

594
00:56:13,436 --> 00:56:16,939
I've got the spaces lined up and
the curators are chomping at the bit,

595
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,941
but there's no money.

596
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:21,327
Well, um,

597
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:27,316
maybe, uh, maybe
I could help you... somehow.

598
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:29,551
Really?

599
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:32,665
Sure.

600
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:45,134
- Que eso?
- Hostility relief.

601
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:49,454
You live in this town,
you got to have something
or you go out of your mind.

602
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:58,013
Are you going to make me stand
with my back against the wall,

603
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,416
blindfolded with a cigarette
in my mouth?

604
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:03,302
Only if you beg.

605
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:08,624
Will you please make me stand
with my back to the wall...

606
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:12,068
with the blindfold on and the
cigarette right in my mouth?

607
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:17,145
You want a drink?

608
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:22,404
So I don't know a lot about what you do.
Is business good in Texas?

609
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:27,409
Uh, can't complain. It's...

610
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:31,380
It's, uh, seasonal.

611
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:33,916
And your grandmother is
running your office.

612
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:38,554
My grand- Uh, no, actually.
You know, I don't really have...

613
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:40,556
cool... an office.

614
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:42,891
I'm, uh, I'm working
out of my house right now.

615
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:46,161
It's really a gorgeous place.
You should see it. It's very special.

616
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:48,230
Wave of the future:

617
00:57:48,231 --> 00:57:51,166
Phone, fax, net, work at home,
leave to play.

618
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:56,038
Thanks. You seem to know
a great deal about business.

619
00:57:56,039 --> 00:58:00,709
A lot of the sort of creative types
I know are, well, generally unaware.

620
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:05,113
Well, I like to keep up
with the way the world runs.

621
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:11,019
My work is kind of about money and
greed and ambition and success.

622
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:13,722
The basic human desires.

623
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:16,325
The bare necessities.

624
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:20,329
Rosalyn, I think you need
to get out of L.A. for a little while.

625
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,443
Too late.

626
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:27,469
It's funny, 'cause...

627
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:33,375
See, I have this terribly
archaic notion that, uh,
art should be about beauty...

628
00:58:33,376 --> 00:58:35,744
and passion and,

629
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:41,416
well, redefining an imperfect world
in a perfect way.

630
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:45,964
Oh, God. We did away
with that years ago.

631
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:53,729
We seem to have gotten away
from our earlier theme.

632
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,231
Which was?

633
00:58:56,232 --> 00:58:59,034
Flirting.

634
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,971
Didn't we do away
with that years ago too?

635
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:05,823
There's been a revival.

636
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:19,536
You wanna look at pictures?

637
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:09,382
I seem to be gaining a whole
new perspective on the rococo.

638
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:15,544
Did, uh, did we, uh,

639
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:20,899
just blow right past
the flirting portion of the evening?

640
01:01:15,304 --> 01:01:20,181
You're trembling.

641
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:39,471
Sweetie.

642
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:44,445
- This isn't how I imagined it.
- What?

643
01:01:46,099 --> 01:01:49,815
I don't want to rush it.

644
01:01:52,539 --> 01:01:55,074
Isn't that my line?

645
01:01:55,075 --> 01:01:59,211
Why don't I just come back tomorrow?
Maybe we could start again.

646
01:01:59,212 --> 01:02:03,849
We could get some lunch, or...

647
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:06,085
- No, I really... I do want you.
- No, you don't.

648
01:02:06,086 --> 01:02:10,963
No, I do. This is just too important
for me to screw up.

649
01:02:14,261 --> 01:02:17,306
Do you, um...

650
01:02:18,465 --> 01:02:21,783
Do you like chocolate?

651
01:02:24,004 --> 01:02:26,038
I do.

652
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:30,176
Imagine if you could have the most...

653
01:02:30,177 --> 01:02:33,646
perfect piece
of chocolate in the world.

654
01:02:33,647 --> 01:02:38,517
Say you went to Switzerland and you got
it there, where they invented it.

655
01:02:38,518 --> 01:02:42,454
What would you do? Would you just
gobble it down right there and then...

656
01:02:42,455 --> 01:02:45,691
or would you maybe wait
a little bit, you know?

657
01:02:45,692 --> 01:02:49,762
Find a perfect place,
light a candle,

658
01:02:49,763 --> 01:02:53,132
put on some music... I don't know,
maybe some Bessie Smith...

659
01:02:53,133 --> 01:02:57,536
or the soundtrack
to Viva Las Vegas...

660
01:02:57,537 --> 01:03:01,240
and then, when everything
was perfect,

661
01:03:01,241 --> 01:03:07,255
then you would savor it as if it
was the last thing you would ever eat.

662
01:03:11,318 --> 01:03:14,295
You are so...

663
01:03:15,488 --> 01:03:18,373
weird.

664
01:03:19,526 --> 01:03:22,461
This is really not easy
for me to talk about.

665
01:03:22,462 --> 01:03:26,610
What are you talking about?

666
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:39,361
This.

667
01:04:02,602 --> 01:04:05,214
It's true.

668
01:04:39,572 --> 01:04:42,389
I have a dream.

669
01:05:08,068 --> 01:05:11,904
Come on, Roz. Don't worry about it.
Everybody slips.

670
01:05:11,905 --> 01:05:16,141
I couldn't believe it.
I was like an amateur.

671
01:05:16,142 --> 01:05:19,289
He made me so mad.
I'm gonna get him.

672
01:05:20,113 --> 01:05:24,193
That's sad. You used
to enjoy your work.

673
01:05:25,685 --> 01:05:28,487
Well, I'm gonna enjoy this.

674
01:05:28,488 --> 01:05:31,066
No one plays
with my head like that.

675
01:05:44,671 --> 01:05:48,040
- I'm takin' you home.
- I'll take you home.

676
01:05:48,041 --> 01:05:52,144
No, I mean back to Texas.
There's an airplane that leaves
in an hour and a half.

677
01:05:52,145 --> 01:05:54,813
- We're gonna be on it.
- What about lunch?

678
01:05:54,814 --> 01:05:58,484
We can eat at my house.
I got some tamales in the fridge.

679
01:05:58,485 --> 01:06:01,268
I'm not going to Texas.

680
01:06:09,963 --> 01:06:12,314
Come on.

681
01:06:14,401 --> 01:06:18,618
This is it. This is
where I grew up.

682
01:06:21,641 --> 01:06:25,425
- You live here alone?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

683
01:06:26,713 --> 01:06:29,448
Chinese?

684
01:06:29,449 --> 01:06:34,386
Oh, uh, that- that's left over from
a Chinese New Year's party we had...

685
01:06:34,387 --> 01:06:36,622
in the Year of the Rooster,
I think it was.

686
01:06:36,623 --> 01:06:40,100
I'll take that down later,
maybe, but...

687
01:06:50,136 --> 01:06:54,683
- I like girls.
- How old-fashioned of you.

688
01:06:58,611 --> 01:07:03,348
- Who's this?
- Oh, that. Um...

689
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:06,599
That's an art project
I'm workin' on.

690
01:07:07,787 --> 01:07:10,138
Collage.

691
01:07:11,291 --> 01:07:14,802
I think you have some
very deep-seated problems.

692
01:07:18,198 --> 01:07:21,243
I saw this face in a dream.

693
01:07:22,735 --> 01:07:26,212
- A dream?
- Mm-hmm.

694
01:07:27,173 --> 01:07:32,892
Does that... Does that
sound peculiar to you?

695
01:07:33,613 --> 01:07:36,055
Yes.

696
01:07:37,050 --> 01:07:40,994
Well, it's just sort of
what she looks like.

697
01:07:50,463 --> 01:07:54,266
This is the Ida room,

698
01:07:54,267 --> 01:07:56,618
after my grandma, Ida.

699
01:07:59,873 --> 01:08:04,009
This is my favorite part.

700
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:08,347
- An air conditioner?
- To the casual observer,

701
01:08:08,348 --> 01:08:13,828
but, to an enlightened few,
a personal serenity device.

702
01:08:17,757 --> 01:08:21,560
Just smell
that musty cold air.

703
01:08:21,561 --> 01:08:25,664
Spins a cocoon, magically,

704
01:08:25,665 --> 01:08:29,768
and makes everything seem
as if the world doesn't matter.

705
01:08:29,769 --> 01:08:32,304
Did it ever?

706
01:08:32,305 --> 01:08:34,656
Well...

707
01:08:35,742 --> 01:08:39,678
So, well, where would you like
to sleep tonight?

708
01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:42,314
Where are you sleeping?

709
01:08:42,315 --> 01:08:45,050
Well, that would depend
on what kind of mood I'm in.

710
01:08:45,051 --> 01:08:48,921
Lately I've been
favoring the piano.

711
01:08:48,922 --> 01:08:52,324
I'm kind of in a firm phase.

712
01:08:52,325 --> 01:08:56,195
- Really?
- Yeah.

713
01:08:56,196 --> 01:08:59,081
It gives you the best dreams.

714
01:09:00,033 --> 01:09:04,403
So what kind of mood do you
think you'll be in tonight?

715
01:09:04,404 --> 01:09:07,551
Oh, that would all depend.

716
01:09:12,745 --> 01:09:16,982
Well, you've got me
where you want me.

717
01:09:16,983 --> 01:09:19,334
Now what?

718
01:09:28,828 --> 01:09:31,713
You must be tired
from the trip.

719
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:43,475
I should tell you,
I have a devious plan.

720
01:09:43,476 --> 01:09:46,979
Are you gonna try
to seduce me?

721
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:49,881
In an ultimate kind
of way.

722
01:09:49,882 --> 01:09:52,233
Oh, my.

723
01:09:53,186 --> 01:09:55,798
Are you shocked?

724
01:09:56,789 --> 01:09:59,658
No.

725
01:09:59,659 --> 01:10:03,028
I kinda made some plans
about you too.

726
01:10:03,029 --> 01:10:05,998
Are you being tender?

727
01:10:05,999 --> 01:10:10,269
- Don't be mean.
- No, I mean, don't misunderstand me.

728
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:13,349
I mean, I like you...
tender.

729
01:10:15,375 --> 01:10:18,852
Must be
the personal serenity device.

730
01:10:23,349 --> 01:10:26,735
Close your eyes.

731
01:10:36,262 --> 01:10:39,239
Be still.

732
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:42,250
Breathe.

733
01:10:46,139 --> 01:10:48,490
Again.

734
01:11:01,788 --> 01:11:04,890
This part, right here,

735
01:11:04,891 --> 01:11:07,776
is especially wonderful.

736
01:11:12,565 --> 01:11:14,916
You're so nice.

737
01:11:18,237 --> 01:11:20,605
I'm really not.

738
01:11:20,606 --> 01:11:25,858
Yes, you are.
I can see everything.

739
01:11:59,112 --> 01:12:01,279
No way!

740
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,063
- It's true.
- You- You brought her back here?

741
01:12:05,818 --> 01:12:10,355
Oh, you are the king, man.

742
01:12:10,356 --> 01:12:14,659
Oh, I can't
even process that!

743
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:18,497
I mean, all I did was turn around,
and there she was, smilin' at me.

744
01:12:18,498 --> 01:12:20,699
Did you give her the John Wayne?

745
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:24,102
This is reality, man.
This is not the movies.

746
01:12:24,103 --> 01:12:27,539
Oh, yeah, well, th-that's exactly
what's wrong with the world today is,

747
01:12:27,540 --> 01:12:31,109
is way too much
reality happening.

748
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:35,981
- Oh, speakin' of that, Ramon called today.
- Oh.

749
01:12:35,982 --> 01:12:40,519
Yeah, he said that girl down in
South Flores isn't gettin' any better,

750
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,735
and he wanted to know if we'd
come by and give her a show.

751
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:55,867
Roz?

752
01:12:55,868 --> 01:12:58,219
Yeah.

753
01:12:59,172 --> 01:13:01,807
Hi. You're awake.
Well, you are now.

754
01:13:01,808 --> 01:13:05,343
Um, listen, something just came up that
I need to go do. Do you wanna come?

755
01:13:05,344 --> 01:13:10,215
Oh, sure. Um, I th-think
I'll just change my clothes.

756
01:13:10,216 --> 01:13:12,794
Okay. All right.

757
01:13:17,557 --> 01:13:21,026
- Well, hello.
- Roz, I would like you
to meet my friend Cameron.

758
01:13:21,027 --> 01:13:23,061
Well.

759
01:13:23,062 --> 01:13:26,998
- Hello.
- Hey. Hi.

760
01:13:26,999 --> 01:13:29,401
- Hi.
- How are... Yeah.

761
01:13:29,402 --> 01:13:31,753
So you're here.

762
01:13:32,839 --> 01:13:36,282
Oh, you just...
Well, you're just visitin'.

763
01:13:38,311 --> 01:13:42,814
- This is a good place to live.
My grandma came here...
- Cameron.

764
01:13:42,815 --> 01:13:46,685
She's a pistol, this one.
Nude half the day...
She wasn't from here.

765
01:13:46,686 --> 01:13:51,590
The other half she's clothed.
I mean, she's not a nude... granny.

766
01:13:51,591 --> 01:13:54,292
Cameron, we should
probably get goin'.

767
01:13:54,293 --> 01:13:56,528
You-You gonna...
You drivin'?

768
01:13:56,529 --> 01:13:59,898
No. You're gonna take
a bike. Right?

769
01:13:59,899 --> 01:14:02,567
Right?

770
01:14:02,568 --> 01:14:06,004
Oh! Yo! I'm bikin'.

771
01:14:06,005 --> 01:14:09,007
- Right!
- That's why I got the bike, is to bike.

772
01:14:09,008 --> 01:14:12,511
- And we'll see you there.
- Occasionally, I will ride my bike,
and this is...

773
01:14:12,512 --> 01:14:14,679
- This is one of the occasions.
- Cameron.

774
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,482
- We'll see ya there.
- All right. Okay. I'll see you there.

775
01:14:17,483 --> 01:14:20,266
- Right this way.
- Nice to meet you.

776
01:15:03,763 --> 01:15:07,115
That's really funny.

777
01:15:14,106 --> 01:15:17,515
I can see you smile.

778
01:16:00,086 --> 01:16:02,988
Senora, muchisimas gracias.

779
01:16:02,989 --> 01:16:07,325
- Uh, I'm sorry. I don't speak...
- She wanted to thank you
for what you did.

780
01:16:07,326 --> 01:16:09,494
Oh, I didn't do anything.

781
01:16:09,495 --> 01:16:12,030
Tienes un esposo
muy maraviloso.

782
01:16:12,031 --> 01:16:16,908
She says your, uh,
boyfriend is very wonderful.

783
01:16:33,751 --> 01:16:37,504
That was nice, what you did.

784
01:16:38,856 --> 01:16:41,873
I get more out of it than they do.

785
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:46,243
You fit here.

786
01:16:51,871 --> 01:16:54,453
How long have you been
doing those puppets?

787
01:16:54,454 --> 01:16:56,248
Oh...

788
01:16:57,383 --> 01:16:58,977
a while.

789
01:16:58,978 --> 01:17:00,912
You have some talent.

790
01:17:00,913 --> 01:17:04,616
Thank you.
My father used to do it.

791
01:17:04,617 --> 01:17:07,925
I figured it'd give me something to
fall back on...

792
01:17:07,926 --> 01:17:11,185
...if that career in nuclear physics
didn't work.

793
01:17:11,186 --> 01:17:14,465
There you go, being sensible.

794
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:21,533
So, show me your town.

795
01:17:21,534 --> 01:17:24,436
Where do you hang out?
What's your favorite spot?

796
01:17:24,437 --> 01:17:26,822
- My favorite spot.
- Yeah.

797
01:17:29,308 --> 01:17:32,216
All right.

798
01:17:39,218 --> 01:17:41,569
This is it.

799
01:17:44,757 --> 01:17:48,075
It's a window.

800
01:17:52,465 --> 01:17:55,700
It's got a story.

801
01:17:55,701 --> 01:17:58,586
Okay. Tell me.

802
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:04,476
Long time ago, there was a craftsman
who worked with stone,

803
01:18:04,477 --> 01:18:08,880
and he was commissioned
by the church to build a window.

804
01:18:08,881 --> 01:18:14,152
He fell in love with a girl who sang
in the choir. Her name was Rosa.

805
01:18:14,153 --> 01:18:18,857
But before they could be
married, she became ill,

806
01:18:18,858 --> 01:18:22,393
and she died...

807
01:18:22,394 --> 01:18:27,899
and all he was left with
was this window.

808
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:33,171
He must have spent
every waking hour for years...

809
01:18:33,172 --> 01:18:36,786
carving it for her.

810
01:18:38,177 --> 01:18:41,927
That's why it's called
the Rosa window.

811
01:18:48,187 --> 01:18:50,731
I'm sorry for them.

812
01:18:53,292 --> 01:18:57,495
Well, at least he found her.

813
01:18:57,496 --> 01:19:03,249
You know, most people never
do find that person, I think,
that makes them feel whole.

814
01:19:09,275 --> 01:19:12,210
So, here we are,

815
01:19:12,211 --> 01:19:17,031
all these years later,
talking about them.

816
01:19:20,452 --> 01:19:23,488
I think he'd be glad
you told his story today.

817
01:19:23,489 --> 01:19:26,898
You know,
I guess he would.

818
01:19:36,335 --> 01:19:40,872
That little girl we saw...
what was wrong with her?

819
01:19:40,873 --> 01:19:44,275
I think they said it was some kind
of heart condition.

820
01:19:44,276 --> 01:19:47,594
- Is she going to be okay?
- I don't think so.

821
01:19:50,816 --> 01:19:54,085
The mother and the father,
they were holding hands...

822
01:19:54,086 --> 01:19:57,322
I was watching them...

823
01:19:57,323 --> 01:20:02,040
and that kiss was so sweet.

824
01:20:03,696 --> 01:20:06,664
I didn't know what...

825
01:20:06,665 --> 01:20:11,970
Roz, if you were going,

826
01:20:11,971 --> 01:20:14,879
who would you want
to kiss you good-bye?

827
01:20:15,741 --> 01:20:18,126
- What do you mean? If I were dying?
- Uh-huh.

828
01:20:20,179 --> 01:20:25,183
Whose eyes would you want
to look into last?

829
01:20:25,184 --> 01:20:28,152
Who says I would want to?

830
01:20:28,153 --> 01:20:31,971
- You'd want to be alone?
- Yeah, maybe I would.

831
01:20:35,527 --> 01:20:39,631
No.

832
01:20:39,632 --> 01:20:42,500
I know who I'd want
to kiss good-bye.

833
01:20:42,501 --> 01:20:44,569
Who?

834
01:20:44,570 --> 01:20:47,888
That little girl.

835
01:20:48,841 --> 01:20:53,678
I'd tell her a few things
about surviving in the world.

836
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:57,532
I'd kiss her good-bye
and get on with it.

837
01:21:57,977 --> 01:22:02,023
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

838
01:22:05,351 --> 01:22:08,319
Coffee?

839
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:11,297
You're still here.

840
01:22:19,832 --> 01:22:23,568
So, you like to sleep
on the table.

841
01:22:23,569 --> 01:22:25,937
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

842
01:22:25,938 --> 01:22:30,074
With a nice, soft,
comfortable, air-conditioned...

843
01:22:30,075 --> 01:22:33,945
personal serenity device
upstairs?

844
01:22:33,946 --> 01:22:36,447
You make it sound
like heaven.

845
01:22:36,448 --> 01:22:39,163
It could be.

846
01:22:43,989 --> 01:22:48,059
Okay. Ah...

847
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:51,396
Um, hmm...
It's time I told you.

848
01:22:51,397 --> 01:22:53,931
What?

849
01:22:53,932 --> 01:22:58,308
Um, it's about the thing.

850
01:23:01,006 --> 01:23:03,174
There's something
you gotta understand...

851
01:23:03,175 --> 01:23:06,778
before, um,
we can proceed.

852
01:23:06,779 --> 01:23:09,892
Okay.

853
01:23:10,883 --> 01:23:15,999
- Do you dream?
- No, never. It's bad for you.

854
01:23:18,724 --> 01:23:22,894
I do.
My whole family does.

855
01:23:22,895 --> 01:23:27,198
- It's a family trait.
- Uh-huh.

856
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:29,534
The men especially...

857
01:23:29,535 --> 01:23:32,570
we dream about women,

858
01:23:32,571 --> 01:23:37,448
or, to be more specific,
we dream about...

859
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:40,461
our true love.

860
01:23:42,214 --> 01:23:44,215
Dad dreamt about Mom...

861
01:23:44,216 --> 01:23:49,921
right after he wrecked his motorcycle
somewhere down on Southwest Military.

862
01:23:49,922 --> 01:23:55,333
Cracked his head pretty hard,
but he was always wreckin' things.

863
01:23:56,662 --> 01:24:00,498
Were they dating?

864
01:24:00,499 --> 01:24:06,404
No. You see, that's the thing.
He'd never even met her.

865
01:24:06,405 --> 01:24:11,275
She was in El Paso somewhere, engaged
to this guy who owned an auto body shop,

866
01:24:11,276 --> 01:24:16,714
and, well, he went
and he found her.

867
01:24:16,715 --> 01:24:21,752
It was the same thing with Granddaddy
and with his father too.

868
01:24:21,753 --> 01:24:24,956
I mean, not the part about wrecking
things and smacking your head up,

869
01:24:24,957 --> 01:24:28,935
but the vision.

870
01:24:30,996 --> 01:24:36,680
What are you saying? You had a dream?

871
01:24:40,372 --> 01:24:43,053
But I didn't hit my head.

872
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:52,416
It's open. Hi.

873
01:24:52,417 --> 01:24:55,319
- Hey, is this where I deliver the beer?
- Uh-huh.

874
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,889
What beer?

875
01:24:57,890 --> 01:25:01,759
The beer for the party.

876
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:04,145
What party?

877
01:25:10,235 --> 01:25:13,304
So the guys are fightin' in the Alamo.
The Duke's in the Alamo.

878
01:25:13,305 --> 01:25:16,941
What are they eatin'? They're showin'
'em eatin' chicken, sausages, pastrami.

879
01:25:16,942 --> 01:25:18,943
They never show 'em
with a tamale.

880
01:25:18,944 --> 01:25:22,346
The tamale has never seriously
been represented in American cinema.

881
01:25:22,347 --> 01:25:25,716
- Oh, he is so right.
- Excuse us. Pardon me.
I want you to meet someone.

882
01:25:25,717 --> 01:25:30,021
Hey, Tree! Over here.

883
01:25:30,022 --> 01:25:33,357
This is the Tree Man. He's a friend
of ours, but no one knows his real name.

884
01:25:33,358 --> 01:25:35,793
He takes his tree with him
everywhere he goes.

885
01:25:35,794 --> 01:25:39,197
- Hey, Tree, come here. What's up?
- What's up, babe? Hey.

886
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:44,143
- This is Roz.
She's my friend from California.
- Hi.

887
01:25:46,871 --> 01:25:50,781
Tree's a musician,
plays the saxophone.

888
01:25:52,442 --> 01:25:53,885
Oh. Where do you play?

889
01:25:55,545 --> 01:25:57,261
Um, inside myself.

890
01:25:58,015 --> 01:25:58,916
Really?

891
01:25:58,917 --> 01:26:02,462
That's where the notes lay, see.

892
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:05,723
When you get
all them colors together,

893
01:26:05,724 --> 01:26:09,508
music comes out really sweet,
you know?

894
01:26:09,861 --> 01:26:12,530
Yeah, buddy.

895
01:26:12,531 --> 01:26:16,834
So, what is it
that you do in California?

896
01:26:16,835 --> 01:26:19,537
I'm a fine art consultant.

897
01:26:19,538 --> 01:26:23,207
Oh, isn't that
interestin'?

898
01:26:23,208 --> 01:26:26,219
Yes, it is.

899
01:26:27,212 --> 01:26:29,893
Would you excuse us?

900
01:26:31,583 --> 01:26:34,127
Uh, I'll be over here
if you need me.

901
01:26:37,022 --> 01:26:40,691
All your friends are staring at me
like I'm some kind of a freak.

902
01:26:40,692 --> 01:26:43,427
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing.

903
01:26:43,428 --> 01:26:46,230
- It's bugging me.
- W...

904
01:26:46,231 --> 01:26:48,933
Did you see her face?

905
01:26:48,934 --> 01:26:52,809
- She's a lovely Chinese girl.
- Her English is good.

906
01:27:00,846 --> 01:27:03,948
- Ida, hey!
- Oh, thank you.

907
01:27:03,949 --> 01:27:06,350
- Sure.
- Hi, Ida.
- Oh, hi!

908
01:27:06,351 --> 01:27:09,100
- My favorite lawyer. Thank you.
- Thank you.

909
01:27:14,526 --> 01:27:17,728
My word!

910
01:27:17,729 --> 01:27:20,798
You're beautiful.

911
01:27:20,799 --> 01:27:25,202
- Uh, thank you.
- You're welcome. What's your name?

912
01:27:25,203 --> 01:27:28,088
Rosalyn, or Roz.

913
01:27:29,073 --> 01:27:30,784
I'm Ida.

914
01:27:31,442 --> 01:27:35,146
Well, I know you
and Fletcher are friends,

915
01:27:35,147 --> 01:27:37,682
but you watch out
for my grandson.

916
01:27:37,683 --> 01:27:41,452
His imagination is enlarged.

917
01:27:41,453 --> 01:27:44,855
And where do you think I got that?

918
01:27:44,856 --> 01:27:48,606
She think's she's hard-boiled,
but she has a real soft center.

919
01:27:52,097 --> 01:27:57,042
Folks, Ida has a little number
she's gonna do with the band,
something she's arranged.

920
01:27:57,702 --> 01:28:00,071
Thank you, Jim.

921
01:28:00,072 --> 01:28:05,050
Uh, this is a little something...

922
01:28:06,342 --> 01:28:07,244
from Chopin for my grandson.

923
01:28:07,245 --> 01:28:09,596
Just for you, Fletcher.

924
01:29:26,825 --> 01:29:30,059
Yeah, that was Ida's arrangement
of some longhair music.

925
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:33,158
It's nice to hear you
play jazz again, Ida.

926
01:29:33,398 --> 01:29:37,301
Okay, now somethin' special.
All you kids, come on up. All the kids.

927
01:29:37,302 --> 01:29:39,949
Well, that would be my cue.

928
01:30:20,879 --> 01:30:23,147
He's so good.

929
01:30:23,148 --> 01:30:28,385
- Everyone knows him down on the plaza.
- What do you mean?

930
01:30:28,386 --> 01:30:31,422
Well, just ask any tourist
who's ever been to San Antonio...

931
01:30:31,423 --> 01:30:37,506
They all say, "That guy with
the puppets on Alamo Plaza,
he is the best I've ever seen. "

932
01:30:39,030 --> 01:30:41,915
He's a street performer.

933
01:30:59,651 --> 01:31:03,587
Hi. You all right?

934
01:31:03,588 --> 01:31:05,823
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

935
01:31:05,824 --> 01:31:09,293
Can we just visit, you and I?

936
01:31:09,294 --> 01:31:13,464
- Sure.
- You're quite the excitement around here.

937
01:31:13,465 --> 01:31:16,700
See, everybody's
just clamoring to meet you.

938
01:31:16,701 --> 01:31:18,936
Or at least some idea
of who I am.

939
01:31:18,937 --> 01:31:22,106
I know just how you feel.

940
01:31:22,107 --> 01:31:25,220
Well, you resent it at first,

941
01:31:25,610 --> 01:31:29,680
and then it'll all come clear.

942
01:31:29,681 --> 01:31:33,033
I prefer things a little blurry.

943
01:31:37,656 --> 01:31:41,258
These things wouldn't make it
through the first earthquake in L.A.

944
01:31:41,259 --> 01:31:45,262
Oh. They're cairns, you know.

945
01:31:45,263 --> 01:31:47,264
What is their function?

946
01:31:47,265 --> 01:31:50,334
Remembering.

947
01:31:50,335 --> 01:31:54,505
Remembering things
you never want to forget.

948
01:31:54,506 --> 01:31:59,076
I built that one.
Oh, it's been there a long time now.

949
01:31:59,077 --> 01:32:02,246
- What's it for?
- In 1946,

950
01:32:03,979 --> 01:32:08,752
I lost my...
my baby girl.

951
01:32:08,753 --> 01:32:12,323
I slept out here on the porch
all that summer and that fall.

952
01:32:12,324 --> 01:32:15,759
I just had to be alone.

953
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:20,978
Finally, I built the cairn.

954
01:32:22,567 --> 01:32:25,536
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

955
01:32:25,537 --> 01:32:29,173
There's pain and joy
in all our lives.

956
01:32:29,174 --> 01:32:32,409
Nobody ever told us
any different.

957
01:32:32,410 --> 01:32:36,558
Next year,
Fletcher's father was born.

958
01:32:41,353 --> 01:32:44,864
He wouldn't let go of my hair!

959
01:32:46,257 --> 01:32:51,441
Come on. Let me
show you my old house.

960
01:33:00,972 --> 01:33:03,240
Why don't you still live here?

961
01:33:03,241 --> 01:33:07,511
Oh, well, this is Fletcher's time now.

962
01:33:07,512 --> 01:33:10,648
I have a lovely jacalita
down on the river.

963
01:33:10,649 --> 01:33:13,330
That's a little Mexican house.

964
01:33:14,352 --> 01:33:19,089
Here are Fletcher's little books.
We made them together.

965
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:22,960
You know, they mark
the special times and places.

966
01:33:22,961 --> 01:33:27,698
For instance, here's his first trip
to the coast, and...

967
01:33:27,699 --> 01:33:30,000
Oh, he loved the HemisFair!

968
01:33:30,001 --> 01:33:34,571
That was the World's Fair
here in San Antonio.

969
01:33:34,572 --> 01:33:39,722
I think my favorite is
this little zoo book.

970
01:33:40,945 --> 01:33:44,661
Find the polar bears
and the elephant.

971
01:33:48,086 --> 01:33:53,600
He thought they were hot.
I guess they were.

972
01:33:56,594 --> 01:34:01,265
Yeah.

973
01:34:01,266 --> 01:34:04,709
It's wonderful, isn't it?

974
01:34:06,304 --> 01:34:09,473
Yes.

975
01:34:09,474 --> 01:34:14,678
I know it's more of a curse
than a blessing.

976
01:34:14,679 --> 01:34:20,584
- What?
- Being smart and what
people call "beautiful. "

977
01:34:20,652 --> 01:34:24,888
I'm not bragging, but in my day,
I was considered quite a catch.

978
01:34:24,889 --> 01:34:31,108
I don't think I ever met a man
I felt could outsmart me or out think me.

979
01:34:32,297 --> 01:34:36,433
Those silly creatures did bore me.

980
01:34:36,434 --> 01:34:40,137
Oh, it does cause quite a fuss,
that combination...

981
01:34:40,138 --> 01:34:42,439
smart and beautiful...

982
01:34:42,440 --> 01:34:45,476
but it's mostly
in your own gut.

983
01:34:45,477 --> 01:34:48,812
See, the problem is...

984
01:34:48,813 --> 01:34:53,117
you stop believing...

985
01:34:53,118 --> 01:34:56,561
that he could be
out there waiting for you.

986
01:34:57,722 --> 01:34:59,723
Who?

987
01:34:59,724 --> 01:35:02,609
Your true love.

988
01:35:05,497 --> 01:35:08,932
Don't you know?

989
01:35:08,933 --> 01:35:11,421
My dear.

990
01:35:14,005 --> 01:35:17,741
This is a mistake.
I'm not...

991
01:35:17,742 --> 01:35:20,093
Not what?

992
01:35:21,746 --> 01:35:24,131
Right.

993
01:35:26,684 --> 01:35:29,035
I'm sorry.

994
01:35:33,725 --> 01:35:36,493
Roz?

995
01:35:36,494 --> 01:35:40,164
- What?
- It's me.

996
01:35:40,165 --> 01:35:42,299
Hey, is somethin' wrong?

997
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:45,736
Nothing's wrong.
I don't feel well.

998
01:35:45,737 --> 01:35:50,318
Well, come on. Open the door.
There's somethin' wrong. I know you.

999
01:35:57,182 --> 01:36:02,486
You don't know me.
You don't know anything about me,

1000
01:36:02,487 --> 01:36:06,056
and just because you think
you dreamed me up or saw me
in some kind of vision...

1001
01:36:06,057 --> 01:36:08,625
I did.

1002
01:36:08,626 --> 01:36:11,978
Well, it isn't me, okay?

1003
01:36:12,831 --> 01:36:17,067
You don't know me
or what makes me happy.

1004
01:36:17,068 --> 01:36:21,238
You actually think I'm gonna
fall in love with you and your
musty old house...

1005
01:36:21,239 --> 01:36:24,875
and your corny music and
your oddball cracker friends?

1006
01:36:24,876 --> 01:36:27,124
Yeah.

1007
01:36:28,513 --> 01:36:31,455
What about last Friday?

1008
01:36:33,318 --> 01:36:38,722
Huh? Where were you last Friday,
midnight... 10:00 L.A.?

1009
01:36:38,723 --> 01:36:43,543
Ring a bell?
That's when I saw you.

1010
01:36:44,863 --> 01:36:49,733
- What did you see?
- What did I see? I saw...

1011
01:36:49,734 --> 01:36:54,738
a man, a gun and you,

1012
01:36:54,739 --> 01:36:59,243
and I became very frightened
and I cried out...

1013
01:36:59,244 --> 01:37:01,645
and then things got
very peaceful...

1014
01:37:01,646 --> 01:37:05,999
and this face stuck right in my head
and it was yours.

1015
01:37:07,819 --> 01:37:12,890
Next morning, I get
this word. ' "Formosa. "

1016
01:37:12,891 --> 01:37:15,640
You tel me, Roz.

1017
01:37:21,966 --> 01:37:27,047
I don't know who you are
or what your game is, but it's over.

1018
01:37:31,009 --> 01:37:35,045
Look, Roz, I know you.
We belong to each other.

1019
01:37:35,046 --> 01:37:39,750
You have an idea of who you think I am.
Y-You're wrong. You don't know.

1020
01:37:39,751 --> 01:37:43,487
You know, I can see the person
who you really are,

1021
01:37:43,488 --> 01:37:48,399
not this person who you are pretending
to be because something went wrong.

1022
01:37:49,994 --> 01:37:53,697
I just can't be the person you want.
It's too late.

1023
01:37:53,698 --> 01:37:58,435
I don't want to change you.
I like you just the way you are.

1024
01:37:58,436 --> 01:38:01,772
How can you like me the way I am?
How can you possibly like me
the way I am?

1025
01:38:01,773 --> 01:38:03,907
I believe in you.

1026
01:38:03,908 --> 01:38:08,545
Well, believing doesn't
make it true,

1027
01:38:08,546 --> 01:38:12,364
and believing in me doesn't make me
worth believing in.

1028
01:38:13,618 --> 01:38:17,220
How can you be that dead inside
that you can't see it...

1029
01:38:17,221 --> 01:38:19,556
and you can't feel it?

1030
01:38:19,557 --> 01:38:22,659
Roslyn, you know I'm him.

1031
01:38:22,660 --> 01:38:25,773
Look at me!

1032
01:38:33,838 --> 01:38:38,608
Look, my coming here and pretending
to be nice to you, it was an act.

1033
01:38:38,609 --> 01:38:42,579
I thought you were someone else;
I thought you had money.

1034
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:44,931
Give me your keys.

1035
01:41:25,610 --> 01:41:29,546
Hi, this is Rosalyn, and, whatever.
You know what to do.

1036
01:41:29,547 --> 01:41:33,250
Roz, it's Elaine.

1037
01:41:33,251 --> 01:41:37,454
Um, you know,
you're gonna wanna kill me,

1038
01:41:37,455 --> 01:41:41,191
but, uh, my setup guy called today...

1039
01:41:41,192 --> 01:41:44,861
and he said, "Why didn't your
friend meet my friend at the
Formosa the other day?"

1040
01:41:44,862 --> 01:41:49,166
I said, "What are you talking about?
She's, like, in Texas with him now, "

1041
01:41:49,167 --> 01:41:54,704
and he said, "No, she's not.
I saw him this morning,
and he never met anyone, "

1042
01:41:54,705 --> 01:41:58,808
and I said, "Why wouldn't you
give me his name, you moron?"

1043
01:41:58,809 --> 01:42:04,447
Well, I don't know
who this Fletcher guy is, but, um,

1044
01:42:04,448 --> 01:42:09,928
...at least, you know,
from what you said, he... seemed nice.

1045
01:42:11,522 --> 01:42:13,907
Hello?

1046
01:42:54,098 --> 01:42:59,502
Yeah, I'll take two weeks off
every year, go to "Havaii,"
no matter what's happening.

1047
01:42:59,503 --> 01:43:02,339
I don't own three companies
to be a slave to 'em, you get me?

1048
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:06,022
I live it up.
I don't care who knows it.

1049
01:43:06,711 --> 01:43:09,112
You know those courses on Maui?

1050
01:43:09,113 --> 01:43:11,448
Gotta love 'em.

1051
01:43:11,449 --> 01:43:15,218
I think there are some people
who really, really want to work
themselves to freakin' death.

1052
01:43:15,219 --> 01:43:18,276
Not me.

1053
01:43:32,036 --> 01:43:34,671
So, you, uh, you ever been
to "Havaii"?

1054
01:43:34,672 --> 01:43:37,407
- Hmm?
- Sure.

1055
01:43:37,408 --> 01:43:40,777
I'll tell ya what. If you wanna
have the time of your life,

1056
01:43:40,778 --> 01:43:45,515
I'll take you with me next week,
first class all the way.

1057
01:43:45,516 --> 01:43:49,164
Gee, it's nice of you to offer.

1058
01:48:03,107 --> 01:48:08,811
There are two things
I always wanted to believe in...

1059
01:48:08,812 --> 01:48:11,891
but didn't dare.

1060
01:48:12,583 --> 01:48:18,097
One is that there is
one man, somewhere,

1061
01:48:18,756 --> 01:48:21,835
who was made just for me.

1062
01:48:23,594 --> 01:48:26,829
The other is that I just...

1063
01:48:26,830 --> 01:48:29,098
might...

1064
01:48:29,099 --> 01:48:31,450
deserve him.

1065
01:54:33,964 --> 01:54:36,933
Oh, man, that's crazy.
That is not the way it works...

1066
01:54:36,934 --> 01:54:39,402
in any love film I've ever seen.

1067
01:54:39,403 --> 01:54:41,671
I mean, the clouds part,
the birds are singin',

1068
01:54:41,672 --> 01:54:43,739
the toes are curlin' up
on these people.

1069
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:48,402
Cameron, what do movies have
to do with real life?
