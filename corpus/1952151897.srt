25
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,740

Land of darkness and disorder
where it is clearly the calgine.

49

104
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,780
that is one of the most important
by which the air reaches the lungs.

105
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,780
As the blood began to gush
the artery to cut ...

106
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,860

Who

249
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,820
Revelation 6:

250
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,900
Bean and I watched a white horse;
and that tena him a bow ...

251
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,660
was given a crown and left as the winner.

252
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,220
When I opened the second seal
or second living deca: <<Ven>>

253
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:14,060
Then went out another horse red;
which was granted him ...

254
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,940
Remove the earth peace
and was given a large sword.

255
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:19,900
• You remember that

256
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,260
When he opened the third seal
or third-living deca: <<Come>>

257
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,060
I looked and then a horse black beans

258
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:31,460
him that the tena
a balance in hand.

259
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,060
The estn ticking.

260
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,380
The quarter horse is the PLID.

261
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,180
The name that sat on him was Death
Hades and you.

262
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,860
They are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.

263
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,580
The book of Revelation is the vision
Apstol of John.

264
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,380
Gives a vision of the final
seg n reveals Jes s.

265
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,620
The riders of the first four
seven prophets of doom.

266
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,700
Well la Muerte
PLID horse goes.

267
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,700
- That in fact is green.
- Pestilence in the black horse.

268
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:26,060
- And the red horse is ...
- War.

269
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,260
What is the difference between death
and the War

270
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,900
I believe that war is a good
no concept of the men ...

271
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,980
killing one of them but of conflicts.

272
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,300
Death is something physical and
War a state minimum.

273
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,860
And the rider of the white horse

274
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,580
The white horse rider is lder.

275
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:51,820
Some believe it is the Antichrist
others believe that Jesus Christ is the same.

276
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:02,180
Aidan these people chose to
riders as models for a reason.

277
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:08,020
If you really understand the symbolism
of riders and apparently is as ...

278
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,460
should expect that things
pondrn is much worse.

279
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,220
We are looking for a
team of four people.

280
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,580
They have the intention to charge
two more victims.

281
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,060
My intention is to stop them.

282
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,900
The first suspect is the smaller
weighs between 100 and 115 pounds.

283
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,220
The other three while he watched
Marianne tortured Spitz.

284
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,620
The suspects were arrested
much time around his head.

285
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,460
Must have been having
conversacin tremendous.

286
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:36,100
The second suspect is Garrison Jacobs
whose whereabouts are unknown.

287
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:39,900
The third suspect deals
the death blow for both.

288
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,820
I think the horse PLID.

289
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,180
- Death.
- Why

290
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:51,900
Because the fourth suspect is nico
that on both occasions did not move.

291
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,540
Not even an inch.

292
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,580
The fourth suspect is that the
have to worry about.

293
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,060
Is the group lder.

294
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,140
If you're ending it.

295
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,980
Breslin.

296
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,220
Bres another body at the Bell Hotel.

297
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,980
What got to me

298
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,860
Hello Garrison.

299
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,860
Bres.

300
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,540
You remember when you spoke of
pu winged and the ...

301
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,180
it was intentional
- S said it was impossible.

302
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,300
Retreat this.

303
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,980
- Is the same
- Almost exactly.

304
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,060
It means we are looking for someone
with medical knowledge.

305
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,460
Or a penchant for medicine.

306
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,020
Same thing.

307
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,580
There is no rigging.

308
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,420
Arrived on Monday afternoon
with a single suitcase.

309
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,740
The register is said to be
indefinitely.

310
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,740
Nobody lives in a hotel unless
is home or is hiding from someone.

311
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,300
L É saba was the next.

312
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,700
And the only person who saba why
saba he is in a bag plstico.

313
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,540
- Excuse me.
- Now the only person ...

00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,140

All tracks that tenamos ...

315
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,580
estn bags plstico.

316
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,860
What

317
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,540
Sean told me to help you today.

318
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,860
- I was very excited.
- S.

319
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,100
Perhaps the next time you should not
or a show or a seven-ye ...

320
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,660
photos of the scene of a murder.

321
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,820
Alex is not showed he found them
and I will remove them.

322
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,340
Whatever.

323
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,100
Hey Alex.

324
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,820
Thank you for caring so well for Sean
has been very good with him.

325
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,780
The meeting of parents of school
is tonight.

326
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,180
- Last week I remembered.
-  What time

327
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,500
- Like five minutes ago.
- Shit!  Shit!  Shit!

328
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:11,420
Alex has a lot of potential and
that is why it is so frustrating.

329
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,820
- Do not you do right
- It is wonderfully where is.

330
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,500
But that's not very often.

331
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,020
Alex is what we call a student
High performance ...

332
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,660
without effort.

333
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,340
You do not have to work hard
to do well who does not.

334
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,100
Well that ...

335
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,660
It's my fault. Not so long step
with them as I wanted.

336
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,060
The therapist of the group to attend
that deca ...

337
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:49,900
Moreover to be frank I think
is that Alex is good to try at least.

338
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,100
It is not very common in boys than
have lost one parent.

339
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,580
S.

340
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,340
I'm sure.

341
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,140
Ya est.

342
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,060
Well go to bed.

343
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:20,700
I was thinking that maybe Sean and
I can take you to school ma ana.

344
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,100
- To make sure you go.
- good.

345
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,300
Good night.

346
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,180
Thanks for coming to see me.

347
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,700
Nothing to do but Kristin I do not think
be the person I should talk.

348
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,260
- I'm not trained for ...
- I want to talk to a normal person ...

349
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,540
not with a man wearing starched
and a recorder.

350
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,060
Agreed.

351
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:06,580
But I tell you
I'm not very good with no os.

352
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,300
- I'm not an a.
- No of course not.

353
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,260
• You have children

354
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,260
I have two children.

355
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,540
What do things together

356
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,100
Actually we do
many things together.

357
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,540
Why not

358
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:29,700
For many things.

359
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,580
Sean was and still small or
I am known.

360
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:41,460
Alex ... I was so concentrated
in my work ...

361
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,660
I lost a child.

362
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:48,060
My parents did.

363
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:56,740
They thought that my mam was sterile
e iban to choose a baby ...

364
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,500
but then my mam knew of orphanages
us the great ms.

365
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,380

00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:12,820
Tena eight when I came to you.
I want to take it.

367
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,620
Could not decrselo but just did.

368
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:25,740
These measures were my parents
and I was her daughter.

369
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,980
It was as it always is so.

370
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,700
By following a birth or Teresa.

371
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,500
Doctors said it was a miracle.

372
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,900
It must have been difficult.

373
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,860
Why people do
things you do

374
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,020

00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,980

00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,180
No saba saba not ...

379
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,060

00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,780
five minutes before you.

381
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,020
Detective Breslin.

382
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,700
If you say some things.

383
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,260
Aidan I wonder what you think about m.

384
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:02,420
Pens that was a sweet or slo ita
mistreated by the world

385
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,580
- What do think now
- Still the same.

386
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,340
You would

387
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:18,260
As you know I knew that
have a special relationship.

388
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,900
Why your mother

389
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,700
- Because I hate my father.
- Why not him

390
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:32,860
You prefer to be dead or
live the rest of his life without his beloved

391
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,860
I prefer to be dead.

392
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,700

You realize

393
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,100

No eres la Muerte.

396
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,860
Know the difference between death
and War detective

397
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,180
S Death is a physical
War and a state minimum.

398
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,820
He has reason.

399
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,940
Death is what happens in the end
War is what others.

400
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,060
What is the EDDM

401
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:14,660

409
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:12,660
No wait.

410
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,260
What are you feeling
It seems that podrs survive

411
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,820
Should feel that justice exists.

412
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,180
Still you do not feel dispensable

413
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,740
Tu coraz?n te said that it

No sorry.

00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,740
I am your daughter and let them suffer.

00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,740
T suffer now ...

421
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,620
The worst thing you can know
War and then death.

00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,260
Now you'll drown mam.

423

Came to find this

430
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,180
What is manipulating detective.

431
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,660
What is manipulated to create
what she wants.

432
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,700
Stingray why not call
Children's Services to reflect ...

00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,580
She is a fucking monster.

Can you crawl

476
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,540
We can connect
the chip to the IP address.

477
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,140
And you dnde dir

478
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,460
Probably if the IP address was
issued by the OC ...

479
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:02,340
We can locate the physical address.

480
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,380
Do it.

481
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,940

Used magnesium in the discs around

How could that be
• With CFC

609
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:51,100
Enough sleep
an elephant.

610
01:01:56,100 --> 01:02:01,020
It is more like what I've seen
someone to start an coraz?n.

611
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:16,260
As he found Corey

612
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,180
Tell me.

613
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,300
dead.

614
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:24,740
- Corey was an amazing person.
- No doubt.

615
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:28,420
Corey and T are different worlds.

616
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:33,060
How do two people
as you know

617
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,180
Want to know how people like
we can know

618
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:39,820
We are nowhere  Cmo
not going to be

619
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:46,460
The world from my room
and from Corey ...

620
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:50,220
and that of anyone
looking for something or someone ...

621
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,300
not found in your home.

622
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:57,380
And Taylor suffering

623
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:02,700
S is pretty screwed.
That makes you happy

624
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:07,660
Is that what you think  What is
we do is for our happiness

625
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:12,340
Do not know anything about suffering.

626
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,700
But now is giving attention "no

627
01:03:16,780 --> 01:03:18,660
Now I'm giving
attention Kristin.

628
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:24,140
I have four victims and
only two riders.

629
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:29,580
Can save much time
and energy now.

630
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:34,060
Never catch the plague never.

631
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,820
And the white horse rider ...

632
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:41,820
Can not find someone as
someone as you find yourself.

633
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,900
You would    It was as it happened

634
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:47,620
• The horse rider of the horse
White found you ...

635
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:51,380
and organizes all of this growth
a frmula to show the world

636
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:55,660
S that is what makes a lder.

637
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:59,820
Can learn a lot from him.

638
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:09,340
Not as.

639
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:24,100
Dnde is Sean

640
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,620
I left to go to dinner at a friend's house.
I did not think you came.

641
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,540
We talk

642
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:47,180
This place is good.
Come with your friends

643
01:04:48,060 --> 01:04:52,020
S sometimes with my friends but
Last I do alone.

644
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:56,300
Sometimes I come after school
when Sean is at a friend's house ...

645
01:04:56,540 --> 01:04:58,340
t working.

646
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:02,380
Should start to come together ...

647
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,300
once a week
and may do so ...

648
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:07,500
something of ours.

649
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,300
Clear.

650
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:18,820
Pap Sean has started to
many questions.

651
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:21,700
Why You are not ever
And stuff.

652
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:27,420
They can answer them but will
begin to ask mam.

653
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:33,820
Alex I want you to know that ...

654
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:41,660
'm sorry you had to
spend that time alone with your mam.

655
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:49,740
But you know anything that will
because they were all rather than you.

656
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:58,100
Not that you have not been ah
That night it's not back.

657
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:06,940
Everything you not with your mam
was difficult for everyone.

658
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:15,060
But since I came back I am
you said that back.

659
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:24,900
Alex if I am
Work is bad very bad.

660
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:30,620
But now nearly complete and when finished
all be different.

661
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:35,100
-  Everyone differently
- I promise.

662
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:53,980
The division of the West needs you
in a case of attempted violacin.

663
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:55,620
Instruccin of the meeting is tonight.

664
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:57,780
Hey Krupa wait wait.

665
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,820
I do not have time for this.

666
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:02,300
There are still two riders all out.

667
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:05,740
We were told that there will be four victims
and we have four victims.

668
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,220
No still have not finished.

669
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,220
Let me explain something.

670
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:14,140
Chose the Four Horsemen
of Revelation for a reason.

671
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:17,340
Sabas that the word "Apocalypse"
not even mean the end of the world

672
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,420
- No.
- The literal translation is ...

673
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:21,780
"lifting the cloak."

674
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:25,660
All this time have been trying
show us something.

675
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,980
They have left tracks and all that.

676
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:31,700
Look for AC. É this is the website
connected to the computer.

677
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:34,900
It is a template.
There are thousands of members.

678
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:38,100
See that date
Is new not ah.

679
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:40,420
When I first saw was the
space to write the pass a.

680
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:41,420
January 21

681
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,540
It ma ana.

682
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:44,940
All this time has tried to
lead to something.

683
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,460
Bring something  Not you see

684
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:50,060
- What will come
- I do not know but pass ma ana.

685
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:54,700
We know two of them. If we could
discover what connects them ...

686
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:57,500
That leads us to the other two.

687
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,260
- And I need more time for that.
- We have no more time.

688
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:02,740
- Stop!
- Krupa!

689
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,860
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
were sent ...

690
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:08,180
to create Hell on Earth.

691
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:10,620
And being ma ana.

692
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,220
Well you have 24 hours.

693
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:26,140
We have been leaving bread crumbs.

694
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:30,180
I guess we have lost some
because ...

695
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:35,740
Bres

696
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:42,340
Four ales are all indicating
directions.

697
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,740
Mary Anne Spitz one two three four.

698
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,980
Silva's apartment one
two three four.

699
01:08:48,300 --> 01:08:51,860
Garrison room Jacobs ...

700
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:55,180
There are only three.

701
01:08:55,380 --> 01:09:02,620
S that is why there is no rigging
no ceremony no paint no collar ...

702
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:04,900
nor removed anything to the body.

703
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:09,860
That is why n is not to lift the veil
Garrison Jacobs is not the third victims.

704
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,660
And what was it

705
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,980
Garrison Jacobs is the pestilence.

706
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:33,340
I was trying to take
my beauty nap.

707
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:46,460
Garrison Jacobs forced us to punish
the innocent.

708
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:47,820
What they said

709
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:51,020
Who was bothering his son.

710
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:54,580
- I lied I was ...
- Spite mint.

711
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:57,660
- As it bled.
- And do pruning because ...

712
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:00,020
not needed to pestilence
as much as the others.

713
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:04,620
- Slo l  operating computers.
- It would have been nice to make ...

714
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,140
the rite of pestilence complete.

715
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:11,540
Three riders does not sound the same.

716
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:14,380
That only means that
There is a rider less.
