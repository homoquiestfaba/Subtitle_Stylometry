Yeah.

12
00:01:34,134 --> 00:01:36,214

- No, it's not.

It's just eggs.

18
00:01:47,627 --> 00:01:49,627
She comes through my line
every Sunday,

19
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:52,431
yelling at her kids,
giving me a stack of coupons.

20
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:54,433
She can never find
her Costco card,

21
00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:58,115
so I always let her use mine
so she can get a discount.

to respond to me?

I didn't realise
that much time had passed.

30
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:19,937
I sent you a very well-crafted
message three weeks ago.

31
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,381
I spell-checked it
and everything. Got crickets.

32
00:02:22,383 --> 00:02:24,743
Then, today, out of the blue,
you hit me up,

33
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,905
asking if you want
to grab dinner.

34
00:02:26,907 --> 00:02:28,428
What changed?

35
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,228
I had a shitty day.

What was so shitty about it?

37
00:02:32,913 --> 00:02:35,795
The state decided
to execute my client.

38
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:39,517
- I didn't know that was still legal here.
- Yep.

39
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,759
It's legal in 31 states,

40
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,481
and Ohio happens
to be one of them.

41
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:43,642
Was he innocent?

42
00:02:43,644 --> 00:02:45,724
Even if he's not,
the state shouldn't decide

43
00:02:45,726 --> 00:02:47,207
whether he lives or dies.

44
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:50,129
Sorry.

45
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,772
Me, too.

46
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:56,775
Normally, I would go home and
have a glass of wine by myself,

47
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:59,096
but I didn't feel like
being alone.

48
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:01,419
Not tonight.

49
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:03,981
You didn't have any friends
or family you can call?

50
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,183
No.

51
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,066
So you turned to Tinder.

52
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:10,268
(chuckles) Yeah.

Word?

57
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,557
You had this sad look
on your face.

58
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:21,281
I felt sorry for you.

59
00:03:23,042 --> 00:03:24,523
Damn.

60
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:26,204
I didn't mean for that
to sound shady.

61
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,528
Well, it did.

62
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:33,933
My dad took that picture of me.

63
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:38,616
And, to be honest, I don't have
many photos of myself.

64
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,499
- Why not?
- I know what I look like.

65
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:42,340
Pictures aren't just
about vanity.

66
00:03:42,342 --> 00:03:44,342
They're proof
of your existence.

67
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:46,624

00:09:01,621 --> 00:09:03,344
Let's see 'em.

181
00:09:10,871 --> 00:09:12,912
Right there.

182
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:17,196
(blowing)

183
00:09:22,282 --> 00:09:23,681
(honks horn)

184
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:26,804
- (window whirring down)
OFFICER: May I help you?

185
00:09:26,806 --> 00:09:28,847
Do you have a warrant?

186
00:09:28,849 --> 00:09:30,769
(sighs) Ma'am, he's already
agreed to the search.

187
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,051
I don't need a warrant.

188
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,855
- What's in the boxes?
- Shoes.

189
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:38,857
You mind if I take a look?

190
00:09:38,859 --> 00:09:41,260
- That's fine.
- (rummaging)

191
00:09:41,262 --> 00:09:43,464
(indistinct police radio
communication)

192
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:49,109
(blowing)

193
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:56,596
(indistinct police radio
communication)

194
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:02,242
Could you please hurry up?

195
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:06,647
What did you say?

196
00:10:08,488 --> 00:10:10,089
It's just cold.

197
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,936
Put your hands on your head,
and get on the ground now.

198
00:10:17,938 --> 00:10:20,219
- Are you serious?
- Get on the fucking ground!

199
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,582
- Get on the fucking ground!
- Why is he under arrest?

200
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:26,064
Back in the car,
or you're going to jail, too!

201
00:10:26,066 --> 00:10:28,466
QUEEN: I am an attorney,
and I demand to know why

202
00:10:28,468 --> 00:10:29,948
- this man is under arrest.
- Sir.

203
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,950
Sir, sir, sir, we don't
have to do this.

204
00:10:31,952 --> 00:10:33,230
Why is he under arrest?

205
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,992
- What is your name?
- Get back in the car!

206
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:37,395
- What is your badge number?
- Get back in the fucking car!

207
00:10:37,397 --> 00:10:39,116
Get back in the car. We got this.

208
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:40,919
Why is he under arrest?
What is your badge number?

209
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:44,563
Sir, sir, it was a turn signal.
I ain't done nothing wrong. Sir...

210
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:46,724
- I'm reaching for my cellphone.
- Keep your hands where I can see 'em!

211
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:48,766
- I have the right to record this arrest.
- Hands where I can see 'em!

212
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:51,008
I'm reaching for my cellphone!
(screams)

213
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,012
(grunting and yelling)

214
00:10:57,217 --> 00:10:59,737
Put your fucking hands...
Stop resisting!

215
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:03,101
Stop! Stay down on the fucking ground!

216
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:05,543
- Stop...
- Please stop!

217
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:08,307
Stop fucking resisting!
Now stay down!

218
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:09,387
(grunting, yelling)

219
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:11,791
Stop fucking resisting!

220
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:13,433
Stop!

221
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:19,757
(yells)

222
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,759
(officer gurgles, exhales)

223
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:23,724
(gasps)

224
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:31,211
(shuddering breaths)

225
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:51,512
(shuddering breaths)

226
00:11:57,998 --> 00:11:59,799
Are you OK?

227
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:02,603
Yeah.

228
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:10,730
(sighs)

229
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,537
You good?

230
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:21,019
Huh? You OK?

231
00:12:21,021 --> 00:12:22,783
(trembling breaths)

232
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:26,066
Let's go.

233
00:12:29,189 --> 00:12:31,552
We can't just leave him here.

234
00:12:33,193 --> 00:12:34,675
Yes, we can.

235
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:37,558
Now, let's go.

236
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:53,093
Come on!

237
00:13:17,117 --> 00:13:18,997
SLIM:
I got to call my dad.

238
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:21,360
- (window whirring down)
- What the fuck are you doing?

239
00:13:21,362 --> 00:13:22,841
(clattering)

240
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,083
QUEEN: We can't call anybody.
It'll make them accomplices.

241
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:27,326
SLIM: You could've just said that.
Now we ain't got no phones.

242
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:30,249
QUEEN: Phone ain't nothing
but a tracking device.

243
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:31,850
SLIM: You're bleeding a lot.

244
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,134
QUEEN:
It's OK. It only grazed me.

245
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:38,296
SLIM: Fuck!
Why didn't you stay in the car?

246
00:13:38,298 --> 00:13:40,098
QUEEN:
So, this is my fault?

247
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,504
If I didn't get out the car,
you would be dead right now.

248
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:47,785
SLIM: We got to get you to a hospital.
QUEEN: No!

249
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:49,947
We can't. Just keep driving.

250
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:52,110
- (trembling breaths)
SLIM: Here.

251
00:13:52,112 --> 00:13:54,952
- Use this to stop the bleeding.
QUEEN: Fuck.

252
00:13:54,954 --> 00:13:57,595
SLIM: What if he was wearing
a body cam, huh?

253
00:13:57,597 --> 00:13:59,878
There was a camera in the car.

254
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,199
This shit about to be
all over the fucking news.

255
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:04,081
QUEEN: That's why
we have to keep going.

256
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,803
- We can't run forever.
- I know that!

257
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:08,446
But we got to keep running
until we come up with a better plan.

258
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:09,687
SLIM: Start throwing out some ideas.

259
00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:11,530
QUEEN: Since when am I in charge
of coming up with the ideas?

260
00:14:11,532 --> 00:14:14,692
- Since you made the decision to run!
- We made that decision together.

261
00:14:14,694 --> 00:14:16,297
SLIM:
I don't remember that.

262
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:20,140
Man, fuck this.

263
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:23,543
(tyres squeal)

264
00:14:24,584 --> 00:14:27,185
(tyres squeal)

265
00:14:27,187 --> 00:14:28,907
- Where are you going?
- I'm a find somebody

266
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,708
with a phone so I can call my family.

267
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,152
- If you do, they'll know where we are.
- Great.

268
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:35,753
- What if they kill us?
- Don't say that!

269
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:37,635
There's no guarantee they won't.

270
00:14:37,637 --> 00:14:39,319
(panting)

271
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,203
You're a black man that killed
a cop and then took his gun.

272
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:45,603
I'm not a criminal.

273
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:47,207
You are now.

274
00:14:56,937 --> 00:15:01,101
I just want to go home,
and I want to see my family.

275
00:15:02,662 --> 00:15:07,186
If you turn yourself in,
you will never see them again.

276
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:12,630
All we can do is go forward.

277
00:15:12,632 --> 00:15:14,355
There is nothing
back there for us.

278
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,395
Please.

279
00:15:17,397 --> 00:15:19,397
Let's just keep going.

280
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,998
What about your family, huh?

281
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,762
You don't care about
leaving them behind?

282
00:15:25,366 --> 00:15:27,207
No, I don't.

283
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:34,892
We can't just keep driving.

284
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:37,135
We need to figure out what
the fuck we gonna do.

285
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,656
All right.

286
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:40,379
All right, all right.

287
00:15:40,381 --> 00:15:42,341
Let's go to my uncle's house.

288
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:44,302
We can... We can stay there
for a few days,

289
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:45,783
then we can figure out
our next move.

290
00:15:45,785 --> 00:15:47,386
Where does your uncle live?

291
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:49,907
- New Orleans.
- That's hours from here.

292
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:52,353
Then we should get going.

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,800

- No, we're fine.

353
00:19:43,264 --> 00:19:47,266
We just uh... We took a wrong
turn somewhere and got lost.

354
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:49,750
Uh... Where are we?

355
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:53,312
Oh, this here is Kentucky,
my friends.

356
00:19:53,314 --> 00:19:56,795
Don't you worry. We'll get you some gas,
and you'll be on your way.

357
00:19:56,797 --> 00:19:59,838
- Ma'am, how's your leg?
- Uh... much better.

358
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,441
Thank you.

359
00:20:06,327 --> 00:20:07,886
SHERIFF:
Gas costs money.

360
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:09,608
SLIM:
Oh, shit, oh.

361
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,290
I left my stuff back in the car.

362
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:12,770
QUEEN:
Me, too.

363
00:20:12,772 --> 00:20:14,972
SHERIFF (chuckles):
All right. I got you.

364
00:20:14,974 --> 00:20:16,454
- (grunts)
- Thank you.

365
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:19,139
- Thanks so much.
- Yep. I'll be right back.

366
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:26,307
(indistinct chatter
over police radio)

367
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:32,990
(electronic chiming)

368
00:20:32,992 --> 00:20:34,992
Howdy. Y'all got gas cans?

369
00:20:34,994 --> 00:20:37,878
Uh... yeah. First aisle.
Can't miss it.

370
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:48,726
- I'd like to fill this up.
- That's gonna be ten bucks.

371
00:20:48,728 --> 00:20:50,088
All right.

372
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,850
DISPATCH:
187, 10-29 Frank.

373
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:54,933
Officer shot and killed in Ohio
by two assailants.

374
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:57,175
Suspects are
one young black male,

375
00:20:57,177 --> 00:20:58,776
one young black female.

376
00:20:58,778 --> 00:21:00,899
YBF was wounded by officer.

377
00:21:00,901 --> 00:21:03,781
Suspects are said to be
armed and dangerous.

378
00:21:03,783 --> 00:21:06,145
Last seen operating
white Honda Accord.

379
00:21:08,469 --> 00:21:10,308
- Stop pacing.
- I can't help it.

380
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,510
- You look guilty.
- I am guilty.

381
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:13,991
Have you been charged?

382
00:21:13,993 --> 00:21:15,956
- No.
- Then you're not guilty.

383
00:21:24,604 --> 00:21:26,806
Why is he staring at us
like that?

384
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,289
I don't know.

385
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,770
(cash register beeping)

386
00:21:32,772 --> 00:21:34,814
CASHIER:
Do you need anything else?

387
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:37,898
Is that it?

388
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,539
Um...

389
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:45,144
Yeah, yeah, that's uh...
that's it.

390
00:21:55,516 --> 00:21:57,716
- Get in the driver's seat.
- Are you crazy?

391
00:21:57,718 --> 00:21:59,400
I think he knows.

392
00:22:04,604 --> 00:22:06,604
(engine starts)

393
00:22:06,606 --> 00:22:09,088
- Oh, fuck.
- Y'all gonna leave without me?

394
00:22:11,011 --> 00:22:13,293
- SHERIFF: Whoa.
- Get in the car.

395
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:16,415
Take it easy.

396
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:18,296
(whispers):
The fuck?

397
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:20,618
- (scoffs)
- Take it easy.

398
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,422
Get in.

399
00:22:24,824 --> 00:22:27,025
All right. All right.

400
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:28,828
I'm getting in.

401
00:22:34,874 --> 00:22:36,674
SHERIFF:
My name's Edgar.

402
00:22:36,676 --> 00:22:39,116
I've lived in Kentucky
all my life.

403
00:22:39,118 --> 00:22:41,118
My wife died three years ago,

404
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,284
and I've been raising our son
all by myself.

405
00:22:44,924 --> 00:22:47,405
I'm all he's got in this world.

406
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,370
Watching him grow up has been
the greatest blessing of my life.

407
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:56,093
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna kill you.

408
00:22:56,095 --> 00:22:59,298
Well, is it true?
Did y'all kill that police officer?

409
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,339
It was self-defence.

410
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:03,502
Oh, I'm sure it was.

411
00:23:03,504 --> 00:23:05,142
I've got some colleagues

412
00:23:05,144 --> 00:23:07,267
who have crossed the line
more than once.

413
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:11,389
QUEEN:
Pop the trunk.

414
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,150
- SLIM: Why?
- Just do it.

415
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,474
(trunk opens)

416
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:21,921
Get in. Please.

417
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:32,812
(grunting)

418
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:38,257
EDGAR: Look, I don't know
what happened,

419
00:23:38,259 --> 00:23:40,137
but whatever it was,

420
00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:43,941
I'm sure you had good reason
for doing what you did.

421
00:23:43,943 --> 00:23:47,107
Now, please let me help you.

422
00:23:53,993 --> 00:23:56,714
What'd you do that for?
He wanted to help us.

423
00:23:56,716 --> 00:23:58,155
He isn't gonna help us.

424
00:23:58,157 --> 00:24:01,999
It is their job to make you
feel like everything will be OK,

425
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:04,482
but the second you confess,
you become property of the state.

426
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,203
Is that what you want?

427
00:24:06,205 --> 00:24:08,088
You want to be
the state's property?

428
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:11,892
No.

429
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,542
(truck door opens)

430
00:24:37,797 --> 00:24:39,358
SLIM:
Slow down.

431
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,798
QUEEN:
I got it.

432
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,162
SLIM: I'm just trying to keep us
from getting pulled over again.

433
00:24:44,164 --> 00:24:46,325
QUEEN:
I'm hungry.

434
00:24:46,327 --> 00:24:48,045
SLIM:
Me, too.

435
00:24:48,047 --> 00:24:50,088
Let's stop at McDonald's
or something.

436
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,769
QUEEN:
That's disgusting.

437
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:54,174
SLIM: Now ain't the time
to be choosy.

438
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,220
BOY (laughs):
Do it again.

439
00:25:03,222 --> 00:25:04,784
(both sigh)

440
00:25:05,825 --> 00:25:09,147
Ah, shit.
We ain't got no money.

441
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:11,109
Check the glove box.

442
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:12,951
(rummaging)

443
00:25:12,953 --> 00:25:15,155
- Anything?
- No.

444
00:25:17,718 --> 00:25:20,158
- Look at God.
- (chuckles softly)

445
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,563
(boys laughing, chatting indistinctly)

446
00:25:24,204 --> 00:25:26,083
- Oh!
- Ooh.

447
00:25:26,085 --> 00:25:27,607
Oh, man.

448
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,049
(rummaging)

449
00:25:32,051 --> 00:25:33,972
- Hey!
- What you doing?

450
00:25:33,974 --> 00:25:36,055
QUEEN:
Chill. I got this.

451
00:25:44,184 --> 00:25:47,388
Hey. You want to make some
money and get some free food?

452
00:25:48,629 --> 00:25:50,469
What's the catch?

453
00:25:50,471 --> 00:25:52,473
Ain't no catch, little man.

454
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,634
All right.
What y'all want?

455
00:25:55,636 --> 00:25:57,275
Let me get
a double cheeseburger

456
00:25:57,277 --> 00:26:01,159
with a ten-piece chicken nuggets
and sweet-and-sour sauce.

457
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:05,444
And I'll have a chicken sandwich
with no condiments and a small fries.

458
00:26:05,446 --> 00:26:07,328
You can keep the change.

459
00:26:08,127 --> 00:26:10,650
Ain't gonna be that much left
after all that.

460
00:26:14,053 --> 00:26:15,533
(boy grunts)

461
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:17,857
(chewing loudly)

462
00:26:22,263 --> 00:26:24,263
You make a lot of noise
when you eat.

463
00:26:24,265 --> 00:26:27,908
Woman, this could be my last meal.
Would you just let me be?

464
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:33,433
It's just hard for me to eat
with you making that much noise.

465
00:26:34,554 --> 00:26:36,556
(chewing quietly)

466
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,522
I never heard of someone
not being able to eat

467
00:26:43,524 --> 00:26:47,084
because they're disgusted
by the sound of other people eating.

468
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:50,368
I know it's weird,
but I have a thing about it.

469
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:53,292
How you avoid the sounds
of people eating?

470
00:26:53,294 --> 00:26:55,215
I eat alone most of the time.

471
00:26:56,297 --> 00:26:58,058
That's not surprising.

472
00:27:03,304 --> 00:27:05,102
You scared?

473
00:27:05,104 --> 00:27:06,747
- No.
- (chuckling): You're lying.

474
00:27:07,988 --> 00:27:09,867
How do you know?

475
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:11,589
You answered too fast.

476
00:27:11,591 --> 00:27:13,472
BOY (in distance):
Come on, man!

477
00:27:13,474 --> 00:27:15,474
I thought,
if a person answered quickly,

478
00:27:15,476 --> 00:27:17,516
that meant they were
telling the truth.

479
00:27:17,518 --> 00:27:19,998
My dad always told me the person
that answers too quickly

480
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,959
had a lie ready to go.

481
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:24,163
Well, that's good to know.

482
00:27:26,366 --> 00:27:29,126
How you know if your clients
are telling the truth?

483
00:27:29,128 --> 00:27:30,448
I don't.

484
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,331
Then how can you defend 'em?

485
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:33,933
That's my job.

486
00:27:35,055 --> 00:27:36,654
Are you a good lawyer?

487
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:37,856
BOY (in distance):
Come on!

488
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:39,578
I'm an excellent lawyer.

489
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:43,381
Why do black people always
feel the need to be excellent?

490
00:27:43,383 --> 00:27:45,586
Why can't we just be ourselves?

491
00:27:47,226 --> 00:27:49,709
BOY (in distance):
(laughs) All right, go again.

492
00:27:54,034 --> 00:27:55,756
We should go.

493
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,048
Hey.

494
00:28:08,769 --> 00:28:10,648
Is this y'all?

495
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,252
(shouting on video)

496
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:18,698
Nah, man, that ain't us.

497
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,220
- (engine starts)
- Wait! My daddy want to talk to y'all.

498
00:28:23,222 --> 00:28:25,304
- Wait, where you going?
- (engine revving)

499
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:26,345
(thud)

500
00:28:26,347 --> 00:28:27,586
MAN (groans):
Fuck!

501
00:28:27,588 --> 00:28:29,747
- Daddy! Daddy!
- God!

502
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:30,948
Oh, shit!

503
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,792
(man groaning)

504
00:28:33,794 --> 00:28:37,234
- Nigga, watch where you're going, dawg!
- I'm sorry. I didn't see you coming.

505
00:28:37,236 --> 00:28:40,319
- You almost killed my daddy!
- God, think you got my bad knee.

506
00:28:40,321 --> 00:28:41,999
- Can you move it?
- You broke my daddy leg!

507
00:28:42,001 --> 00:28:44,122
MAN: Stop crying like a little
bitch! I'm a be a'ight.

508
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:46,164
Mama told you to stop
calling me a little bitch.

509
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:48,005
Nigga, I'll call you
what the fuck I want.

510
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:49,568
- We have to go now.
MAN: Ooh.

511
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:52,851
- Y'all gotta take him to the hospital.
- We can't go to a hospital.

512
00:28:52,853 --> 00:28:56,174
So, I can get y'all food, but you can't
take my daddy to the hospital?

513
00:28:56,176 --> 00:28:58,736
- Where's the nearest hospital?
- We don't have time for that.

514
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,939
- Would you calm down?
- Don't talk to me like that.

515
00:29:00,941 --> 00:29:02,460
I'll talk to you however I want.

516
00:29:02,462 --> 00:29:04,021
MAN: Y'all sound like
me and my bitch.

517
00:29:04,023 --> 00:29:05,384
BOY:
Don't call my mama a bitch.

518
00:29:05,386 --> 00:29:06,865
Nigga, I wasn't talking
about your mama.

519
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:09,187
Come on, we're gonna take you
to the hospital.

520
00:29:09,189 --> 00:29:10,829
I got plenty of hos.

521
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:13,030
Your mama ain't
the only one, too.

522
00:29:13,032 --> 00:29:16,233
(groans) Shit!

523
00:29:16,235 --> 00:29:18,476
Ooh. Move your fat ass.

00:38:55,655 --> 00:38:58,297
- You'd just let us get killed?
- That's the risk you take.

698
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:00,140
Fuck you, Earl.

699
00:39:03,944 --> 00:39:05,826
How long you need to stay?

700
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:08,307
A night or two.

701
00:39:08,309 --> 00:39:10,429
Well, which one is it?

702
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,473
Two nights.

703
00:39:13,354 --> 00:39:14,475
Fine.

704
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,036
- We need some cash.
- How much?

705
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:19,918
Enough to last us for a few days.

706
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,320
What else?

707
00:39:21,322 --> 00:39:23,080
We need one of your cars.

708
00:39:23,082 --> 00:39:24,762
You can kiss my black ass.

709
00:39:24,764 --> 00:39:26,365
He love them cars
more than he love us.

710
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:29,206
I ain't got no extra cars
just laying around.

711
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:32,452
- What about the blue Catalina?
- Goddess, shut the fuck up.

712
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:35,574
And it's turquoise.

713
00:39:35,576 --> 00:39:37,336
I don't know
how low-key we gonna be

714
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:39,297
riding around in a turquoise Catalina.

715
00:39:39,299 --> 00:39:42,141
That's the whole point.
We'd be hiding in plain sight.

716
00:39:43,743 --> 00:39:45,705
Do you agree
to my terms or not?

717
00:39:47,388 --> 00:39:49,106
(scoffing chuckle)

718
00:39:49,108 --> 00:39:51,590
I ain't giving you no damn car.

719
00:39:51,592 --> 00:39:53,073
You owe me.

720
00:40:06,806 --> 00:40:08,607
OK.

721
00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:10,328
Go get my car keys.

722
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,649
Sit down.

723
00:40:11,651 --> 00:40:13,372
Y'all need to figure out
what the hell

724
00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:15,053
you gonna do
once you leave here.

725
00:40:15,055 --> 00:40:16,294
We will.

726
00:40:16,296 --> 00:40:17,735
- Youngblood.
- Hmm?

727
00:40:17,737 --> 00:40:19,538
She speak for both of you?

728
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,858
No.

729
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:23,261
- Could have fooled me.
QUEEN: Don't do that.

730
00:40:23,263 --> 00:40:25,984
Well, I'm just trying to
understand this nigga mind.

731
00:40:25,986 --> 00:40:28,306
You ask me, he seems a little...

732
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:30,629
(quietly):
a little slow.

733
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:31,990
I think we should go to Cuba.

734
00:40:31,992 --> 00:40:33,791
EARL:
That's what I'm talking about.

735
00:40:33,793 --> 00:40:36,754
Isn't that where um... um...

736
00:40:36,756 --> 00:40:39,717
Assata Shakur went
after she killed that state trooper?

737
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:40,959
Allegedly killed.

738
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:43,562
We just gotta keep driving
until we get to Miami, then...

739
00:40:43,564 --> 00:40:45,843
We'll be standing in front of
a large body of water.

740
00:40:45,845 --> 00:40:47,125
How we supposed to cross that?

741
00:40:47,127 --> 00:40:49,847
- I don't know yet.
- Of course you don't.

742
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:51,891
You got a better idea?

743
00:40:56,657 --> 00:40:59,737
- Where you think you're going?
- To lay down.

744
00:40:59,739 --> 00:41:01,739
I'm exhausted.

745
00:41:01,741 --> 00:41:04,142
Y'all ain't going nowhere
till you shave your heads.

746
00:41:04,144 --> 00:41:05,544
We're not doing that.

747
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,586
Wanna keep walking around
looking like that tape?

748
00:41:07,588 --> 00:41:09,990
You're not shaving my head.

749
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,433
Fine. You can choose.

750
00:41:14,435 --> 00:41:15,676
You're a woman.

751
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:19,960
I believe in
a woman's right to choose.

752

NEWSWOMAN: A nationwide
manhunt is underway

800
00:45:57,278 --> 00:45:59,758
after a police officer
was shot and killed

801
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,241
during a routine traffic stop
last night in Cleveland, Ohio.

802
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:05,444
Investigators are looking
for two suspects,

803
00:46:05,446 --> 00:46:08,165
one African-American male
and one female,

804
00:46:08,167 --> 00:46:10,449
in connection with the killing
of the officer.

805
00:46:10,451 --> 00:46:13,292
Police say the suspects
fled the scene

806
00:46:13,294 --> 00:46:14,813
in a white Honda Accord

807
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:18,055
and are considered to be
armed and dangerous.

808

in an effort to track down
the suspects.

The shooting has gained
national attention

812
00:46:26,427 --> 00:46:28,185

my pinkie ring.

814
00:46:30,391 --> 00:46:32,353
Whatever, nigga.

815
00:46:34,674 --> 00:46:36,755
My daddy gave me that ring.

816
00:46:36,757 --> 00:46:39,838
Don't nobody care
about that fake-ass ring.

suspects, please contact our hotline...

00:46:50,451 --> 00:46:52,333
(sighing):
Yeah.

823
00:46:52,853 --> 00:46:55,854

824
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:57,496
That your problem.

00:46:57,498 --> 00:46:59,216
Nigga, you're my problem.

826
00:46:59,218 --> 00:47:00,658
Bitch, give my goddamn ring!

827
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,502
Oh, you want to get crazy?
I'm crazy, and I will fuck you up.

828
00:47:03,504 --> 00:47:05,743
I'm sitting here trying
to mind my business...

829
00:47:05,745 --> 00:47:07,346
Time for you to give my ring back.

830
00:47:07,348 --> 00:47:08,947
- Oh, hell no, nigga!
- Fuck!

831
00:47:08,949 --> 00:47:12,069
I'm sick and tired of you putting
your motherfucking hands on me!

832
00:47:12,071 --> 00:47:14,833
- I deal with too much to be dealing...
- Here he go.

833
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:16,274
EARL:
Give me my shit, bitch!

834
00:47:16,276 --> 00:47:17,516
Give me my fucking ring!

835
00:47:17,518 --> 00:47:19,116
You want me to talk to him?

836
00:47:19,118 --> 00:47:21,118
- Give me my goddamn respect!
- No.

837
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,601
- I want my motherfucking respect!
- We're not gonna go there.

838
00:47:23,603 --> 00:47:25,643
EARL: Bitch, I will
choke you out of these braids.

839
00:47:25,645 --> 00:47:28,125
- Please don't.
- (arguing continues)

840
00:47:28,127 --> 00:47:30,167
He didn't used to be like this.

841
00:47:30,169 --> 00:47:32,252
(Earl continues shouting)

842
00:47:33,374 --> 00:47:35,376
Iraq fucked him up.

843
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:38,699
(Slim sighs)

844
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:41,860
I don't want to deal
with this shit.

845
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:43,904
Let's leave
first thing tomorrow.

846
00:47:47,627 --> 00:47:50,389
- You OK?
- Yeah.

847
00:47:50,391 --> 00:47:52,391
How is that possible?

848
00:47:52,393 --> 00:47:55,073
You took somebody's life
yesterday.

849
00:47:55,075 --> 00:47:57,077
I guess um...

850
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:02,640
I'm just used to saying
that I'm OK when I'm not.

851
00:48:02,642 --> 00:48:04,364
I know the feeling.

852
00:48:06,407 --> 00:48:10,127
What if God wanted me to die
and I messed up his plan?

853
00:48:10,129 --> 00:48:11,970
I don't think
that's what he wanted.

854
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,614
- How do you know?
- I just...

855
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:17,338
I just think
you were meant to be here.

856
00:48:23,424 --> 00:48:26,344
I'm making
an executive decision.

857
00:48:26,346 --> 00:48:29,146
- We're going to Cuba.
- "Executive decision"?

858
00:48:29,148 --> 00:48:31,349
We can't leave tomorrow
and not know where we're going.

859
00:48:31,351 --> 00:48:34,394
- What about that large body of water?
- We'll figure it out.

860
00:48:35,835 --> 00:48:37,517
(Queen sighs)

861
00:48:42,762 --> 00:48:44,284
(whispers):
I'm scared.

862
00:48:45,725 --> 00:48:47,488
That's all right.

863
00:48:48,808 --> 00:48:51,050
I'll be brave enough
for the both of us.

864
00:48:59,779 --> 00:49:01,940
Hey, uh...

865
00:49:01,942 --> 00:49:04,224
why does your uncle owe you?

866
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:08,666
I got him out of prison once.

867
00:49:08,668 --> 00:49:10,310
For what?

868
00:49:11,071 --> 00:49:13,474
- He killed somebody.
- Damn. Who'd he kill?

869
00:49:15,476 --> 00:49:16,957
My mother.

870
00:49:45,506 --> 00:49:47,508
(panting quietly)

871
00:49:57,236 --> 00:49:59,520
I'm rubbing your head
for good luck.

872

01:15:26,407 --> 01:15:29,887
Unlike the rest of these simple-ass
niggas, I don't approve of what y'all did.

1220
01:15:29,889 --> 01:15:32,731
- We didn't have a choice.
- That don't matter.

1221
01:15:32,733 --> 01:15:34,533
You gave them a licence to kill us.

1222
01:15:34,535 --> 01:15:35,973
He shot at me.

1223
01:15:35,975 --> 01:15:38,135
- You gave him an excuse.
- You weren't there.

1224
01:15:38,137 --> 01:15:39,418
No, I wasn't.

1225
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:42,099
But if I was, I would've took
my ticket and been on my way.

1226
01:15:42,101 --> 01:15:43,941
Can you work more
and talk less?

1227
01:15:43,943 --> 01:15:46,385
I could work a lot faster
if you left me the fuck alone.

1228
01:15:46,387 --> 01:15:49,146
I'm not leaving you
with this car.

1229
01:15:49,148 --> 01:15:51,148

1230
01:15:51,150 --> 01:15:53,393
Damn! This is bullshit.

1231
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,600
What about if I give you
some insurance?

1232
01:16:01,602 --> 01:16:04,001
I don't want no house keys
or no driver's licence,

1233
01:16:04,003 --> 01:16:06,286
cos all of that can be replaced.

1234
01:16:08,928 --> 01:16:10,209
Son.

1235
01:16:15,296 --> 01:16:17,014
Yes, sir?

1236
01:16:17,016 --> 01:16:19,660
How'd you like to take
these nice folks on a walk?

1237
01:16:22,141 --> 01:16:23,462
Yeah.

1238
01:16:23,464 --> 01:16:24,705
Um...

1239
01:16:25,865 --> 01:16:27,265
Yes, sir.

1240
01:16:27,267 --> 01:16:30,868
You keep 'em occupied till I finish
this car. Stay off the street.

1241
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:32,189
I'm uh...

1242
01:16:32,191 --> 01:16:34,191
I know who you are.

1243
01:16:34,193 --> 01:16:36,233
What's your name?

1244
01:16:36,235 --> 01:16:38,318
Everybody call me Junior.

1245
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:41,560
Hi.

1246
01:16:41,562 --> 01:16:43,684
It's an honour to meet y'all.

1247
01:16:50,691 --> 01:16:52,691
JUNIOR:
Going to a protest tomorrow.

1248
01:16:52,693 --> 01:16:55,614
SLIM: For what?
JUNIOR: To support you.

1249
01:16:55,616 --> 01:16:58,135
Can't believe
y'all are here, man.

1250
01:16:58,137 --> 01:17:00,579
(chuckling):
I was just watching y'all,

1251
01:17:00,581 --> 01:17:02,821
like... like, on TV, and then...

1252
01:17:02,823 --> 01:17:04,463
now you walking
right next to me.

1253
01:17:04,465 --> 01:17:06,186
That shit is crazy.

1254
01:17:08,948 --> 01:17:10,950
Really hope y'all make it.

1255
01:17:12,992 --> 01:17:14,595
Yeah, me, too.

1256
01:17:15,636 --> 01:17:18,158
Just know, even if you don't,
it'll be OK.

1257
01:17:22,282 --> 01:17:24,284
QUEEN:
How so?

1258
01:17:25,686 --> 01:17:27,848
Cos then you'll be immortal.

1259
01:17:30,651 --> 01:17:32,531
SLIM:
I like that.

1260
01:17:32,533 --> 01:17:34,535
QUEEN:
I'd rather live.

1261
01:17:37,897 --> 01:17:41,138
JUNIOR:
I want to be immortal, too.

1262
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:43,862
SLIM: You're too young to be
worried about all that.

1263
01:17:43,864 --> 01:17:45,504
JUNIOR:
No, I'm not.

1264
01:17:45,506 --> 01:17:47,104
I could die today.

1265
01:17:47,106 --> 01:17:48,867
SLIM:
Don't say that.

1266
01:17:48,869 --> 01:17:51,110
JUNIOR: I just want people
to know I was here.

1267
01:17:52,873 --> 01:17:55,394
QUEEN: As long as your family
knows you were here,

1268
01:17:55,396 --> 01:17:57,278
that's all that matters.

1269
01:18:24,143 --> 01:18:26,506

- (Queen and Slim sigh)

1270
01:18:30,310 --> 01:18:31,631
Yo, Junior.

1271
01:18:33,514 --> 01:18:35,993
- Could you take our picture?
- (closes door)

1272
01:18:35,995 --> 01:18:38,075
- Yeah.
- (car door opens)

1273
01:18:38,077 --> 01:18:40,237
I don't think
that's a good idea.

1274
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,039
Come on.

1275
01:18:42,041 --> 01:18:44,043
I want proof we were here.

1276
01:18:45,446 --> 01:18:46,967
(sighs)

1277
01:18:57,176 --> 01:18:59,138
Right here.

1278
01:19:07,987 --> 01:19:09,469

1279
01:19:47,788 --> 01:19:50,109

1280
01:19:54,274 --> 01:19:55,635
SLIM:
Yo.

1281
01:19:56,677 --> 01:19:58,316
Yo.

1282
01:19:58,318 --> 01:20:00,237
Do you mind
if we make a detour?

1283
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:02,241
Uh... I do, actually.

1284
01:20:06,687 --> 01:20:08,329
You OK?

1285
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,612
Not really.

1286
01:20:33,634 --> 01:20:36,635
QUEEN: We were close
when I was younger.

1287
01:20:36,637 --> 01:20:39,236
But as I got older,
I felt like...

1288
01:20:39,238 --> 01:20:41,601
I didn't know her any more.

1289
01:20:43,924 --> 01:20:46,366
She didn't know me, either.

1290
01:20:51,972 --> 01:20:54,933
We could go months
without talking.

1291
01:20:54,935 --> 01:20:58,779
And when we did, I hated it.

1292
01:21:00,901 --> 01:21:02,943
I had nothing to say to her.

1293
01:21:05,184 --> 01:21:07,908
She wanted a connection
so badly.

1294
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:11,872
And I just didn't care.

1295
01:21:14,233 --> 01:21:16,316
I didn't need her any more.

1296
01:21:35,736 --> 01:21:37,938
(Queen shudders)

1297
01:21:39,339 --> 01:21:41,421
(sighs, sniffles)

1298
01:21:44,264 --> 01:21:47,347
(sniffles, sighs)

1299
01:21:50,189 --> 01:21:53,712
My grandmother
left the house to both of them.

1300
01:21:53,714 --> 01:21:56,034
My mom wanted to sell it.

1301
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:58,396
My uncle wanted to live in it.

1302
01:21:58,398 --> 01:22:00,118
Typical family bullshit.

1303
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,640
SLIM:
Mm-hmm.

1304
01:22:01,642 --> 01:22:04,645
One night, they were
up at the house, fighting.

1305
01:22:07,567 --> 01:22:10,048
He was really fucked-up.

1306
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,852
He pushed her.

1307
01:22:13,573 --> 01:22:16,976
She fell down a flight
of stairs, cracked her skull.

1308
01:22:19,459 --> 01:22:21,299
She bled out so quick,

1309
01:22:21,301 --> 01:22:23,301
by the time
the ambulance got there,

1310
01:22:23,303 --> 01:22:25,145
she was already dead.

1311
01:22:29,509 --> 01:22:32,831
I had just passed the Bar.

1312
01:22:32,833 --> 01:22:35,916
I was desperate
to try my first case. I...

1313
01:22:38,438 --> 01:22:41,681
I never thought
that that would be it.

1314
01:22:42,803 --> 01:22:44,482
How could you defend the person

1315
01:22:44,484 --> 01:22:46,646
- that killed your own mother?
- (Queen sighs)

1316
01:22:51,411 --> 01:22:53,853
(voice breaking):
I knew it was an accident.

1317
01:22:56,616 --> 01:22:59,417
Does it ever piss you off
that he's alive and she isn't?

1318
01:22:59,419 --> 01:23:01,421
(exhales sharply)

1319
01:23:03,423 --> 01:23:05,425

01:29:46,307 --> 01:29:49,227
Well, these kids, they think it's OK
to kill cops cos of you.

1392
01:29:49,229 --> 01:29:50,988
Who made it OK
for cops to kill us?

1393
01:29:50,990 --> 01:29:52,431
We didn't want this.

1394
01:29:52,433 --> 01:29:53,991
There's a war going on
out there,

1395
01:29:53,993 --> 01:29:55,913
and you welcome this
into our home?

1396
01:29:55,915 --> 01:29:57,755
They didn't start it.

1397
01:29:57,757 --> 01:29:59,518
I want them gone
by the morning.

1398
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:01,639
(sighs)
We can leave right now.

1399
01:30:01,641 --> 01:30:03,243
MR SHEPHERD:
Hey, hey.

1400
01:30:04,164 --> 01:30:06,083
Don't let your pride
get you killed.

1401
01:30:06,085 --> 01:30:07,286
I ain't staying here.

1402
01:30:07,288 --> 01:30:10,688
Look, I got hiding spots
all over this place.

1403
01:30:10,690 --> 01:30:13,414
Even if the cops come,
they won't find you.

1404
01:30:14,174 --> 01:30:16,977
This is a safe place.
Right?

1405
01:30:22,182 --> 01:30:23,744
Y'all hungry?

1406
01:30:25,024 --> 01:30:26,627
Come on.

1407
01:30:32,633 --> 01:30:34,872
There's a bounty out
on your heads.

1408
01:30:34,874 --> 01:30:37,114
How much we worth?

1409
01:30:37,116 --> 01:30:39,358
- 250.
- Total?

1410
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:41,360
- Each.
- That ain't much.

1411
01:30:41,362 --> 01:30:43,120
It's enough to pay
our mortgage off.

1412
01:30:43,122 --> 01:30:45,885
- You gonna turn us in?
- No.

1413
01:30:47,847 --> 01:30:50,249
Earl told me you need a plane.

1414
01:30:50,251 --> 01:30:51,889
Yeah.

1415
01:30:51,891 --> 01:30:53,851
I know a guy in Florida.

1416
01:30:53,853 --> 01:30:55,414
Already gave him a call.

1417
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:58,539
This is his address
and directions to his house.

1418
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:02,700
If you lose that,
you're fucked.

1419
01:31:02,702 --> 01:31:04,944
Let's eat before it gets cold.

1420
01:31:06,347 --> 01:31:08,105
MR SHEPHERD:
I'll lead us in prayer.

1421
01:31:08,107 --> 01:31:09,388
May I?

1422
01:31:09,390 --> 01:31:10,710
Course.

1423
01:31:20,321 --> 01:31:24,164
I'd like to start by thanking God
for the breath in my lungs.

1424
01:31:26,165 --> 01:31:29,927
I'm grateful that we have
a place to sleep tonight,

1425
01:31:29,929 --> 01:31:32,493
food to put in our bellies.

1426
01:31:35,174 --> 01:31:37,617
Thank you for bringing us
this far.

1427
01:31:39,979 --> 01:31:42,181
Thank you for this journey...

1428
01:31:44,345 --> 01:31:47,225
..no matter how it ends.

1429
01:31:47,227 --> 01:31:48,986
Amen.

1430
01:31:48,988 --> 01:31:50,591
SHEPHERDS:
Amen.

1431
01:32:07,288 --> 01:32:09,450
(chewing quietly)

1432
01:32:19,899 --> 01:32:21,620
Get upstairs now.

1433
01:32:21,622 --> 01:32:23,662
- What's going on?
- Just go.

1434
01:32:23,664 --> 01:32:25,506
Get under the bed in our room.

1435
01:32:27,268 --> 01:32:28,989
Take the back stairs.

1436
01:32:41,682 --> 01:32:44,683
- Police! Police!
- (Mrs Shepherd screams)

1437
01:32:44,685 --> 01:32:47,488
OFFICER: Hands on the table!
Tell us where they are!

1438
01:32:48,649 --> 01:32:50,691
Living room, clear!

1439
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:54,131
- May I help you?
- Hands on the table!

1440
01:32:54,133 --> 01:32:56,093
- Tell us where they are.
OFFICER: Upstairs!

1441
01:32:56,095 --> 01:32:57,497
Who's "they"?

1442
01:32:58,177 --> 01:32:59,579
OFFICER:
Go, go.

1443
01:33:06,707 --> 01:33:08,349
Right side, clear.

1444
01:33:13,794 --> 01:33:15,396
Closet, clear.

1445
01:33:17,598 --> 01:33:18,599
(grunts)

1446
01:33:22,201 --> 01:33:23,483
(grunts)

1447
01:33:26,926 --> 01:33:28,167
Clear!

1448
01:33:38,659 --> 01:33:40,541
(police radio chatter)

1449
01:33:46,547 --> 01:33:48,747
You tell us where they went,
we'll let you go,

1450
01:33:48,749 --> 01:33:51,350
and you can enjoy
the rest of your evening.

1451
01:33:51,352 --> 01:33:55,554
How can I tell you where they
went if they were never here?

1452
01:33:55,556 --> 01:33:57,877
Then where'd the fancy car
come from?

1453
01:33:59,879 --> 01:34:03,883
People park their cars
around here all the time.

1454
01:34:10,930 --> 01:34:13,052
You look a lot smarter
than your husband.

1455
01:34:14,334 --> 01:34:16,615
You want to tell me
where they went?

1456
01:34:16,617 --> 01:34:19,058
(helicopter passing overhead)

1457
01:34:22,583 --> 01:34:24,345
OFFICER:
Sergeant.

1458
01:34:41,921 --> 01:34:44,483
(whispering): We have to
leave here at some point.

1459
01:34:44,485 --> 01:34:46,243
I'm not trying to walk
into an ambush.

1460
01:34:46,245 --> 01:34:48,045
I heard cars leave hours ago.

1461
01:34:48,047 --> 01:34:51,249
I'm sure they left some folks behind
to keep an eye on the house.

1462
01:34:51,251 --> 01:34:54,815
Stay here and die of starvation if you
want but I'm getting the fuck out of here.

1463
01:35:37,977 --> 01:35:39,979
(door creaking)

1464
01:35:44,465 --> 01:35:46,226
They got to be out front.

1465
01:35:55,596 --> 01:35:57,036
We got to jump.

1466
01:35:59,640 --> 01:36:01,282
I mean, it's too high.

1467
01:36:02,683 --> 01:36:05,363
What you got to do
is bend your knees

1468
01:36:05,365 --> 01:36:07,164
when you hit the ground, OK?

1469
01:36:07,166 --> 01:36:08,687
Bend and roll.

1470
01:36:08,689 --> 01:36:11,292
(chuckling):
This ain't no damn fire drill.

1471
01:36:13,012 --> 01:36:14,813
(panting)

1472
01:36:14,815 --> 01:36:16,334
All right. Hold on.

1473
01:36:16,336 --> 01:36:18,298
Be careful. Careful.

1474
01:36:23,343 --> 01:36:24,504
QUEEN:
OK.

1475
01:36:25,425 --> 01:36:27,506
(grunts, groans)

1476
01:36:27,508 --> 01:36:28,747
Fuck.

1477
01:36:28,749 --> 01:36:31,110
(groaning)

1478
01:36:32,272 --> 01:36:34,514
(grunting, panting)

1479
01:36:38,157 --> 01:36:40,278
(grunts)

1480
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:43,160
(Queen panting, whimpering)

1481
01:36:43,162 --> 01:36:44,925
All right?

1482
01:36:46,727 --> 01:36:48,486
We... We need to move.

1483
01:36:48,488 --> 01:36:51,489
We need to move.
I'm gonna need you to get up.

1484
01:36:51,491 --> 01:36:53,612
I'm gonna need you to get up,
all right?

1485
01:36:53,614 --> 01:36:56,414
Lean on me. Lean on me.
Lean on me. Lean on me.

1486
01:36:56,416 --> 01:36:58,898
(panting, shuddering)

1487
01:37:06,547 --> 01:37:10,351
Almost there. Stay here.
I'm a check out front. OK?

1488
01:37:20,921 --> 01:37:23,403
(Queen gasping, whimpering)

1489
01:37:26,286 --> 01:37:28,647
(groaning, gasping)

1490
01:37:28,649 --> 01:37:31,329
Sit down here. Sit down here.
Sit down here.

1491
01:37:31,331 --> 01:37:33,974
Sit down. Sit down.
Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

1492
01:37:35,656 --> 01:37:37,538
(door creaking)

1493
01:37:39,138 --> 01:37:40,378
OK, I know how to do this.

1494
01:37:40,380 --> 01:37:43,061
But you got to promise not to scream.
Can you do that?

1495
01:37:43,063 --> 01:37:45,144
I believe in you. Hm?

1496
01:37:46,306 --> 01:37:48,185
I think there are cops out front.

1497
01:37:48,187 --> 01:37:50,187
If they hear you, it's over, we're done.

1498
01:37:50,189 --> 01:37:52,390
(exhales sharply)

1499
01:37:52,392 --> 01:37:54,915
I know how strong you are.

1500
01:37:55,555 --> 01:37:57,836
You can do this. Yeah?

1501
01:37:57,838 --> 01:37:59,840
Wait. Give me your jacket.

1502
01:38:01,281 --> 01:38:03,081
Here. Take that.

1503
01:38:03,083 --> 01:38:04,923
- All right.
- (sniffling)

1504
01:38:04,925 --> 01:38:07,204
(sighs) All right.

1505
01:38:07,206 --> 01:38:09,287
- All right. OK.
- (muffled whimpering)

1506
01:38:09,289 --> 01:38:11,009
All right.

1507
01:38:11,011 --> 01:38:13,253
- One...
- (muffled whimpering)

1508
01:38:18,018 --> 01:38:19,580
..two...

1509
01:38:21,421 --> 01:38:23,303
(shushing quietly)

1510
01:38:25,786 --> 01:38:27,626
- (joint cracks)
- (muffled scream)

1511
01:38:27,628 --> 01:38:30,388
- (shushing)
- (muffled sobbing)

1512
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:31,750
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

1513
01:38:31,752 --> 01:38:33,351
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK. OK.

1514
01:38:33,353 --> 01:38:35,475
- (birds chirping)
- (wind whistling softly)

1515
01:38:37,557 --> 01:38:40,478
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

1516
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:42,802
Sounds like somebody's crying.

1517
01:38:45,164 --> 01:38:47,846
No. That's just nature.

1518
01:38:47,848 --> 01:38:50,528
City boys ain't used to that shit.

1519
01:38:50,530 --> 01:38:52,971
Don't refer to me as "boy."
I ain't no boy.

1520
01:38:52,973 --> 01:38:55,133
- You know what I meant.
- I know the difference

1521
01:38:55,135 --> 01:38:57,135
between a person
and an animal, too.

1522
01:38:57,137 --> 01:38:59,778
Then go walk around.

1523
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:01,940
Better watch
how you talk to me, man.

1524
01:39:01,942 --> 01:39:04,625
Ooh, touchy, touchy.

1525
01:39:16,837 --> 01:39:19,798
- I need to find a screwdriver.
- You know how to boost a car?

1526
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,201
I used to. My older brother
taught me one summer.

1527
01:39:24,084 --> 01:39:25,724
Toolbox.

1528
01:39:25,726 --> 01:39:27,047
(Slim exhales sharply)

1529
01:39:29,049 --> 01:39:31,449
Only car we ever stole
was my dad's.

1530
01:39:31,451 --> 01:39:34,774
He should've known better
than to leave that Acura around us.

1531
01:39:37,738 --> 01:39:39,860
(Slim panting rapidly)

1532
01:40:17,818 --> 01:40:19,940
(Slim panting rapidly)

1533
01:40:21,341 --> 01:40:22,702
Damn it. Fuck.

1534
01:40:29,870 --> 01:40:32,072
- (prolonged beep)
- (ignition sputtering)

1535
01:40:42,322 --> 01:40:45,525
(ignition sputtering)

1536
01:40:48,248 --> 01:40:49,928
(engine starts)

1537
01:40:49,930 --> 01:40:52,653
(both sigh)

1538
01:40:57,057 --> 01:40:59,459
Now, how we supposed
to get out of here?

1539
01:41:49,749 --> 01:41:51,431
What was it?

1540
01:41:52,432 --> 01:41:54,552
Couple of deer
caught in some branches.

1541
01:41:54,554 --> 01:41:55,994
I set 'em free.

1542
01:41:55,996 --> 01:41:58,038
Told you.

1543
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:02,162
(sighs)

1544
01:42:17,017 --> 01:42:19,019
(Queen panting softly)

1545
01:42:21,581 --> 01:42:24,184
(takes deep breath)

1546
01:42:29,109 --> 01:42:31,469
Yo, what you doing?

1547
01:42:31,471 --> 01:42:33,153
(gasping)

1548
01:42:37,077 --> 01:42:38,679
Are you crazy?
Get back in the car.

1549
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:43,123
(laughing)

1550
01:42:46,646 --> 01:42:48,848
F-Fuck.

1551
01:42:50,251 --> 01:42:52,450
(panting)

1552
01:42:52,452 --> 01:42:54,054
(laughs)

1553
01:43:01,661 --> 01:43:03,703
(laughs)

1554
01:43:06,226 --> 01:43:08,546
Are you trying to die?

1555
01:43:08,548 --> 01:43:11,789
No. I just always wanted
to do that.

1556
01:43:11,791 --> 01:43:14,232
Well, don't do it
while I'm driving, OK?

1557
01:43:14,234 --> 01:43:16,674
- You should try it.
- Nah, I'm good.

1558
01:43:16,676 --> 01:43:18,836
- Pull over.
- Nuh-uh.

1559
01:43:18,838 --> 01:43:20,758
Come on, pull over.

1560
01:43:20,760 --> 01:43:22,200
Pull over.

1561
01:43:22,202 --> 01:43:23,641
If I do it, will you please

1562
01:43:23,643 --> 01:43:25,683
let me drive
the rest of the way in peace?

1563
01:43:25,685 --> 01:43:26,925
Swear to God.

1564

01:47:42,702 --> 01:47:44,663
You want me to turn on

1619
01:47:44,665 --> 01:47:46,025
No.

1620
01:47:47,227 --> 01:47:49,470
I want you to tell me a story.

1621
01:47:50,671 --> 01:47:52,230
What kind of story?

1622
01:47:52,232 --> 01:47:54,515
Any story. I don't care.

1623
01:48:06,327 --> 01:48:10,127
When I was little, I asked
my mom where babies come from.

1624
01:48:10,129 --> 01:48:12,850
She said I was
too young to know.

1625
01:48:12,852 --> 01:48:15,092
Then I asked my dad.

1626
01:48:15,094 --> 01:48:18,896
And he said, "Babies are
a product of two people

1627
01:48:18,898 --> 01:48:21,620
that needed something
from each other."

1628
01:48:21,622 --> 01:48:24,181
So I said, "Needed what?"

1629
01:48:24,183 --> 01:48:27,825
He said, "Maybe they needed
to feel seen.

1630
01:48:27,827 --> 01:48:30,351
"Maybe they needed
to feel loved.

1631
01:48:32,191 --> 01:48:34,354
Maybe they needed
to feel human."

1632
01:48:39,360 --> 01:48:40,998
And then what?

1633
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Then I asked my grandmother.

1634
01:48:43,002 --> 01:48:45,365
She said, "Babies come from God.

1635
01:48:47,247 --> 01:48:50,731
They're his way of making sure
no one ever really dies."

1636
01:48:52,852 --> 01:48:55,374
I remember her saying,

1637
01:48:55,376 --> 01:48:58,178
"Through our children,
we are reborn."

1638
01:49:05,905 --> 01:49:08,467
Then I went
to my older brother,

1639
01:49:08,469 --> 01:49:10,828
and I asked him.

1640
01:49:10,830 --> 01:49:13,392
And he said,

1641
01:49:13,394 --> 01:49:15,594
"Nobody knows.
You're just born.

1642
01:49:15,596 --> 01:49:17,875
That's it.
Now leave me alone."

1643
01:49:17,877 --> 01:49:19,319
(Queen chuckles)

1644
01:49:21,322 --> 01:49:24,965
I wasn't satisfied with
that answer, either, but...

1645
01:49:25,566 --> 01:49:27,326
I ran out of
family members to ask,

1646
01:49:27,328 --> 01:49:29,410
so he got the last word.

1647
01:49:33,052 --> 01:49:35,375
So, who was right?

1648
01:49:37,778 --> 01:49:39,218
None of 'em.

1649
01:49:42,862 --> 01:49:45,104

1650
01:49:47,508 --> 01:49:49,510

1651
01:50:19,098 --> 01:50:20,580

1652
01:50:21,301 --> 01:50:23,662

1653
01:50:23,664 --> 01:50:26,665

01:50:26,667 --> 01:50:29,428

01:50:29,430 --> 01:50:30,908
