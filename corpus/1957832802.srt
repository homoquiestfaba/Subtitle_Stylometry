1
00:00:02,448 --> 00:00:06,283
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

2
00:00:08,053 --> 00:00:09,087
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

3
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:12,125
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

4
00:00:13,293 --> 00:00:14,661
Whoa!

5
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,462
Ruh-roh!

6
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:51,066
Um, is that, like, a good
"ruh-roh" or a bad "ruh-roh"?

7
00:00:51,837 --> 00:00:54,504
Never mind! I figured it out!

8
00:00:57,242 --> 00:00:59,978
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

9
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:18,764
Here they come.

10
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:21,500
Everything's in place.
Everyone ready?

11
00:01:23,872 --> 00:01:25,106
Ready.

12
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,009
Set.

13
00:01:29,011 --> 00:01:31,046
No!

14
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:42,225
Whoa!

15
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:46,998
Whoa!

16
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:49,531
There goes my rental deposit!

17
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:51,166
I hate cats.

18
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:54,573
Whoa!

19
00:01:55,807 --> 00:01:58,410
Velma! Daphne! It's go time!

20
00:02:57,076 --> 00:03:01,548
More like, Cat Man, don't!
Am I right, Scoob?

21
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,550
Good show, Mystery Inc!

22
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:10,089
You've certainly lived up to
your most formidable reputation.

23
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:12,858
Now let's see
who this Cat Man really is.

24
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:19,167
Actually, Inspector, I think Ms.
Cat Man might be more accurate.

25
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:22,704
Olive Khadka!

26
00:03:25,641 --> 00:03:26,340
But why?

27
00:03:26,342 --> 00:03:29,477
Your family owns the ski resort.

28
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:30,478
Exactly.

29
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,481
But my father plans to leave
it all to his new wife, Heena.

30
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:34,516
She's half his age, you know.

31
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:37,586
What do you think, Velma?
Does it match the others?

32
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:40,288
Let's find out.

33
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,623
...creature
to scare away skiers

34
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,992
and force the lodge
out of business.

35
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:47,565
And I would have gotten away
with it, too, if it weren't for...

36
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:51,635
Hey, where did
those meddling kids go?

37
00:04:00,714 --> 00:04:02,814
Wow, just as I suspected.

38
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:05,517
The materials used
to make the Cat Man suit

39
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,719
are identical
to every other costume

40
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:10,491
from the criminals
we've captured.

41
00:04:13,027 --> 00:04:16,497
Henry Bascombe's
Space Kook suit.

42
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:19,766
Captain Cutler's
ghost diver suit.

43
00:04:19,768 --> 00:04:23,670
That freaky ghost clown,
Harry the Hypnotist.

44
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:27,675
All starting with the
Black Knight, Mr. Wickles.

45
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:29,444
I always thought
it was a strange coincidence

46
00:04:29,446 --> 00:04:33,949
that all our cases seemed to
involve some supernatural creature.

47
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:35,517
But it wasn't a coincidence.

48
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,253
These costumes
were created by one person,

49
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:41,256
a secret mastermind
hiding behind the curtain

50
00:04:41,258 --> 00:04:44,529
and pulling the strings
all this time.

51
00:04:45,097 --> 00:04:47,799
Coco Diablo!

52
00:05:15,763 --> 00:05:19,435
Happy Halloween.
I'm Coco Diablo.

53
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:24,505
I'm here for the, uh, VIP tour.

54
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:26,307
Of course you are.

55
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:28,044
Right this way.

56
00:05:30,447 --> 00:05:31,379
As you can see,

57
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:35,284
we manufacture a wide variety
of popular Halloween costumes.

58
00:05:35,286 --> 00:05:38,187
Classic gorilla. Silly hot dog.

59
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:42,661
Treacherous maven.
We make it all here.

60
00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:45,295
Of course,
here at Diablo Costumes,

61
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:51,569
we pride ourselves in only making
safe, family-friendly products.

62
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:53,439
Of course.

63
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:56,274
We only use
the best materials here.

64
00:05:56,276 --> 00:06:00,078
None of those chintzy,
disposable synthetics

65
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,114
other companies rely upon.

66
00:06:02,116 --> 00:06:07,188
And our costumes
are crafted by true artisans.

67
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:10,123
Excuse me, Miss Diablo.

68
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,126
How many times must
I tell you not to interrupt

69
00:06:13,128 --> 00:06:14,594
when I'm with a client?

70
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:16,597
But I've just completed
the prototype

71
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:18,899
for next year's Dracula costume.

72
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:20,501
Dracula, again!

73
00:06:20,503 --> 00:06:26,343
Really, Trevor, can't you design
anything other than Dracula?

74
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:30,781
Well, I can try to, but...

75
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:35,618
Oh, my!

76
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,022
Try harder.

77
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:51,669
That's my apprentice, Trevor.
Don't mind him.

78
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:52,870
He shows promise.

79
00:06:52,872 --> 00:06:57,709
But he's always wearing those
ridiculous hats. No offense.

80
00:06:57,711 --> 00:06:58,643
Now, where were we?

81
00:06:58,645 --> 00:07:03,482
I'd like to see something
a little more scary,

82
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:05,651
if you catch my drift.

83
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:09,291
Of course. Step into my office.

84
00:07:24,674 --> 00:07:27,778
So, who told you about me?

85
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,544
Olive Khadka.

86
00:07:29,546 --> 00:07:33,181
Ugh. Olive, such a shame.

87
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:34,984
I deliver
state-of-the-art costumes,

88
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:39,922
and these fools end up getting
defeated by those...

89
00:07:39,924 --> 00:07:43,029
I appreciate the rec
nonetheless.

90
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,429
Let me cut to the chase.

91
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:46,630
I got the inside track

92
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,800
that a new highway is about
to run through Winterhaven.

93
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:53,138
- And I...
- And you're looking to buy up the land on the cheap

94
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,673
so you can
make a monstrous profit.

95
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:59,280
But first, you need a way
to scare off the competition.

96
00:08:00,748 --> 00:08:04,083
Um, yeah, something like that.

97
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:05,751
I have just the thing.

98
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:07,155
Esteban.

99
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:21,304
Hmm. Looks a bit constricting.

100
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,410
I call it the 10,000 Volt Ghost.

101
00:08:28,412 --> 00:08:30,546
The cloth conforms
to any body type,

102
00:08:30,548 --> 00:08:35,185
and you can adjust the current
to control the mind of anyone

103
00:08:35,187 --> 00:08:37,454
you want to submit to your will.

104
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:40,592
It's my greatest creation yet.

105
00:08:44,997 --> 00:08:45,763
How much?

106
00:08:45,765 --> 00:08:48,966
For you, it could be free...

107
00:08:48,968 --> 00:08:50,302
I'm listening.

108
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:52,037
...on this one condition.

109
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,805
Get rid of those meddling kids

110
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:57,476
who've been destroying
all of my brilliant costumes.

111
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,680
And their dumb dog, too.

112
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:04,984
That might be
a little difficult.

113
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:06,853
Oh. And why is that?

114
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:12,092
Because, like, I am
one of those meddling kids.

115
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:16,164
And I am their dumb dog.

116
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:19,002
Whoa!

117
00:09:23,173 --> 00:09:25,107
Nice work, Shaggy and Scooby.

118
00:09:25,109 --> 00:09:30,014
And as promised,
here are your Scooby...

119
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:39,291
Jinkies!

120
00:09:41,828 --> 00:09:43,461
You've just helped us
nab the mastermind

121
00:09:43,463 --> 00:09:47,932
of one of the most notorious
costume crime syndicates in the world.

122
00:09:47,934 --> 00:09:49,300
The most notorious.

123
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:50,769
But how did you kids do it?

124
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:52,137
It's simple, really, Sheriff.

125
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:56,108
You see, I had a hunch that a lot of
the cases we've been solving lately

126
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,109
were somehow connected.

127
00:09:57,111 --> 00:09:59,946
Scooby and Shaggy bravely
put themselves in harm's way

128
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:01,748
time after time to gather clues.

129
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,952
While Velma, our resident
science whiz, analyzed that data,

130
00:10:05,954 --> 00:10:08,222
which led us here
to Coco's factory.

131
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:09,623
- Humph.
- And Daphne,

132
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,993
well, she, uh... She, uh...

133
00:10:12,995 --> 00:10:14,995
Uh, what was it again?

134
00:10:14,997 --> 00:10:16,331
Fred, don't be silly.

135
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:20,135
You know very well
that I... I, um...

136
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:23,472
Come to think of it,
I'm not really sure what I did,

137
00:10:23,474 --> 00:10:25,510
or what I ever do.

138
00:10:26,244 --> 00:10:29,278
I see. Well, good work.

139
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,847
Yeah, yeah. Good work.

140
00:10:30,849 --> 00:10:34,451
But you know what they say
about too much of a good thing.

141
00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:36,620
Okay, time to go, Miss Diablo.

142
00:10:36,622 --> 00:10:42,629
Fire away, news monkeys!
All press is good press.

143
00:10:44,764 --> 00:10:48,299
Well, gang,
another mystery solved.

144
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:49,701
And with Coco Diablo locked up,

145
00:10:49,703 --> 00:10:52,838
things should be a whole
lot quieter from now on.

146
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,407
Sounds groovy to me, man.

147
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:57,645
Yeah, me too.

148
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:04,853
But what if there really can be
too much of a good thing?

149
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:30,514
You need any help
with that, Velma?

150
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:34,986
I'm pretty good with
whatever it is you're doing.

151
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:37,088
No, thanks. I've got a system.

152
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,323
Okay. Well,
if you change your mind,

153
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:42,163
I'll just... just be over here.

154
00:13:42,897 --> 00:13:48,167
Just what exactly are you
hiding in all of this, Mr. Humdrum?

155
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:49,803
Oh, please be
a fleet of ghost pirates

156
00:13:49,805 --> 00:13:54,574
he wanted to use to scare a small fishing
village into selling him their land.

157
00:13:54,576 --> 00:14:00,381
Oh! Or... Or maybe
let's just see who you really are.

158
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:01,849
Hey, what are you doing?

159
00:14:01,851 --> 00:14:04,118
No, stop. Stop that.

160
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,422
Oh, that's my face.
I can...

161
00:14:07,424 --> 00:14:09,324
Oh! Get off...

162
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:11,293
Get off of me!

163
00:14:14,698 --> 00:14:17,400
Oh, my eye. Aah! Oh!

164
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:19,102
Sorry, Fred,

165
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:21,070
he was inflating tax refunds
for his clients

166
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:24,408
by claiming fake deductions,
exaggerating expenses,

167
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,711
and falsifying home energy
improvement reports.

168
00:14:27,713 --> 00:14:29,213
But that's so boring.

169
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:33,453
Take him away, Sheriff,
or whatever.

170
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:34,419
Who cares.

171
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:36,254
Uh, not to add insult to injury,

172
00:14:36,256 --> 00:14:41,427
but we don't really take people
away for crimes like these.

173
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:42,328
Now, Charlie,

174
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,663
do you promise to pay
back what you owe?

175
00:14:44,665 --> 00:14:47,902
Uh... Yes.

176
00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:50,773
Okay then, that's that.

177
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,609
Hmph.

178
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,952
Hey, who ate my lunch?

179
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,894
You know, I'm starting to think
that maybe it was a mistake...

180
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:13,195
Don't say it, Fred.

181
00:15:13,197 --> 00:15:16,833
- Don't say it was a mistake capturing Coco Diablo.
- Capturing Coco Diablo.

182
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:17,901
Since we locked her up,

183
00:15:17,903 --> 00:15:20,236
we haven't had
one interesting case.

184
00:15:20,238 --> 00:15:24,842
But it's good a criminal
mastermind is behind bars, right?

185
00:15:24,844 --> 00:15:26,477
Yeah, good for her maybe.

186
00:15:26,479 --> 00:15:28,979
She's becoming a celebrity
in there.

187
00:15:28,981 --> 00:15:31,115
Her book was a best-seller.

188
00:15:31,117 --> 00:15:34,119
Velma, you bought a copy?

189
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:35,153
Oh.

190
00:15:35,155 --> 00:15:36,621
I buy every bestselling book

191
00:15:36,623 --> 00:15:38,190
written by criminals
we put away.

192
00:15:38,192 --> 00:15:41,194
It's a helpful way to get
insight into the criminal mind.

193
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:44,163
And Coco's prose
is surprisingly poetic.

194
00:15:44,165 --> 00:15:45,998
Huh! A lot of good
that will do us,

195
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,836
solving mysteries
about missing socks.

196
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:49,770
Dude, the way I see it,

197
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:54,708
fewer freaky cases means fewer
freaky ghosts freaking us out.

198
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:55,475
Yeah!

199
00:15:55,477 --> 00:15:57,979
So, let's just enjoy
this downtime, man.

200
00:15:57,981 --> 00:16:00,982
I mean, dude,
tomorrow's Halloween!

201
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:06,722
I sure hope I didn't jinx us!

202
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:27,178
Like, wow, Scoob,

203
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,715
this is shaping up to be
the best Halloween haul ever.

204
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:31,449
Yeah!

205
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:33,487
Trick-or-treat!

206
00:16:34,922 --> 00:16:37,322
Uh, Raggy, it's Ricky.

207
00:16:37,324 --> 00:16:38,790
Yeah, tricky and treaty.

208
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,427
Our favorite candy-related
activities.

209
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:43,396
No, Raggy, I'm stuck.

210
00:16:43,398 --> 00:16:45,131
- Like, where Scoob?
- Here.

211
00:16:45,133 --> 00:16:46,332
- Around here?
- Uh-huh.

212
00:16:46,334 --> 00:16:47,901
I'll try ringing the bell.

213
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:50,371
We'll just use our foot
as leverage.

214
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:53,242
Ooh, a raggy roor.

215
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:57,077
Wait. Is this
what I think it is?

216
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:58,647
Mm, caramel!

217
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:01,483
This house is made of candy!

218
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:27,345
Did you?
I did. You did, too?

219
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,714
Happy Halloween!

220
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,550
You thinking what I'm thinking?

221
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,621
Let's suit up!

222
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:45,131
- Yeah, these will work.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

223
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:51,005
Hey, looks like the gang wants to
get a head start on trick-or-treating!

224
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:53,507
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

225
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:55,743
After you, sir.

226
00:17:55,745 --> 00:17:58,515
No, I insist.

227
00:17:59,717 --> 00:18:01,051
Aah!

228
00:18:02,152 --> 00:18:05,555
Happy Halloween!

229
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:09,392
Shaggy, Scooby, look, I know
you're excited for Halloween,

230
00:18:09,394 --> 00:18:12,662
but I've had it
with these rinky-dink cases.

231
00:18:12,664 --> 00:18:14,531
We need a real mystery.

232
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:15,165
But how?

233
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,834
And more importantly, why?

234
00:18:16,836 --> 00:18:19,403
I thought about it,
and I had a great idea.

235
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:22,473
I say we take a page
out of Coco Diablo's book,

236
00:18:22,475 --> 00:18:26,146
and drum up
a little publicity of our own.

237
00:18:26,847 --> 00:18:28,013
Not today, though, right?

238
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:30,081
I mean, today's Halloween.

239
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:33,021
Yeah, we're pumpkins.

240
00:18:33,354 --> 00:18:35,921
All right, guys, listen.
Just hear me out.

241
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:36,889
What if we set up a booth

242
00:18:36,891 --> 00:18:39,525
at the Coolsville
Halloween Festival today?

243
00:18:39,527 --> 00:18:41,962
The exposure
could bring us new business.

244
00:18:41,964 --> 00:18:44,498
- Oh!
- That's your big idea?

245
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,999
A booth at a festival?

246
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,437
What's our next case?
Judging the biggest hog?

247
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:52,507
Well, that's not all.

248
00:18:52,509 --> 00:18:53,708
We could put out a guest book

249
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,576
so people can leave
their contact information,

250
00:18:55,578 --> 00:18:59,148
or tell us about mysterious
occurrences in their lives.

251
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,917
But... but trick-or-treating!

252
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,687
And candy!

253
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:09,125
- Everything okay, Fred?
- I, uh...

254
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:12,130
I think I see my grandmother
over there.

255
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,776
Hi, wishing well.

256
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:26,878
Gee, I feel kind of silly

257
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,716
talking to a hole
in the ground, but...

258
00:19:31,219 --> 00:19:35,590
I sure do wish
we had a creepy caper again.

259
00:19:38,993 --> 00:19:41,964
Well, here goes nothing.

260
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:49,304
Like, I didn't know Fred
was so broken up about this.

261
00:19:49,306 --> 00:19:55,009
Yeah, I never thought he'd believe in
something as crazy as a wishing well.

262
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:56,111
Must be pretty serious.

263
00:19:56,113 --> 00:20:00,950
Maybe it wouldn't be the worst
thing in the world to try his idea.

264
00:20:00,952 --> 00:20:03,454
Here he comes.

265
00:20:05,457 --> 00:20:06,523
Sorry about that.

266
00:20:06,525 --> 00:20:08,792
It wasn't my grandma after all.

267
00:20:08,794 --> 00:20:11,763
So now, where were we?

268
00:20:14,134 --> 00:20:14,966
What?

269
00:20:25,513 --> 00:20:26,778
Now, like, just to be clear,

270
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,616
the plan is we work the
festival during the day,

271
00:20:30,618 --> 00:20:31,584
and then at sundown,

272
00:20:31,586 --> 00:20:34,521
- we all go out trick-or-treating, right?
- Mm-hmm.

273
00:20:34,523 --> 00:20:35,555
Of course, Shaggy.

274
00:20:35,557 --> 00:20:38,491
Now, why don't you and Scooby
go work the crowd a little?

275
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:41,729
See if you can lead
some customers over here.

276
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:42,630
And who's to say

277
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:45,499
we don't find some
succulent snack age as well!

278
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:48,770
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

279
00:20:48,772 --> 00:20:50,272
What can I do to help?

280
00:20:50,274 --> 00:20:51,139
Oh, uh...

281
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:55,012
Why don't you put the
guest book on the table?

282
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:57,815
Fine.

283
00:21:00,018 --> 00:21:02,153
I hope I can handle that.

284
00:21:02,854 --> 00:21:04,654
Oh, I guess I can.

285
00:21:04,656 --> 00:21:06,356
Oh, and maybe open it

286
00:21:06,358 --> 00:21:07,991
so people are encouraged
to sign it.

287
00:21:07,993 --> 00:21:11,662
Got it, Fred.
It's not rocket science.

288
00:21:11,664 --> 00:21:16,501
Detectives here!
Anybody need a detective?

289
00:21:16,503 --> 00:21:18,338
Hey, Shaggy, look.

290
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:24,243
Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

291
00:21:24,245 --> 00:21:25,211
You know what?

292
00:21:25,213 --> 00:21:26,779
We've been working pretty hard,
Scooby-Doo.

293
00:21:26,781 --> 00:21:29,148
Like, it couldn't hurt to stop
for a healthy snack, right?

294
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:32,588
No, sir. Not at all.

295
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,031
Why is no one
visiting our table?

296
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:47,335
And just how are we
supposed to compete with that?

297
00:21:47,337 --> 00:21:49,673
Oh.

298
00:21:54,211 --> 00:21:57,882
Three, two, one, bob!

299
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:24,443
Was that what I think it was?

300
00:22:24,445 --> 00:22:26,347
It sure seemed like a...

301
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:27,713
Ghost!

302
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:28,948
We have to tell the gang.

303
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,216
Hold on.

304
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:34,554
This could, like, seriously impede
our chances of trick-or-treating.

305
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:37,493
Dude, let's say nothing.

306
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:44,899
Hey, fellas,

307
00:22:44,901 --> 00:22:47,703
any luck finding new
mysteries for us to solve?

308
00:22:47,705 --> 00:22:49,805
What? Oh, no, no.

309
00:22:49,807 --> 00:22:51,240
Not much going on, really.

310
00:22:51,242 --> 00:22:55,010
Definitely no ghouls or ghosts
lurking about.

311
00:22:56,882 --> 00:22:58,381
How have things been over here?

312
00:22:58,383 --> 00:23:00,917
Like, any big mysteries
come our way

313
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:02,552
while we were gone?

314
00:23:02,554 --> 00:23:04,655
Uh, what's wrong with Scooby?

315
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,391
My good bud, Scooby-Doo here,

316
00:23:07,393 --> 00:23:09,627
is just so excited
about Halloween

317
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:11,696
he can hardly contain himself.

318
00:23:11,698 --> 00:23:14,700
Ix-nay on the ost-ghay.

319
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:16,068
Man!

320
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,570
We saw a-a-a ghost!

321
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:21,075
Sorry, Shaggy.

322
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:24,744
Oh, I get it.

323
00:23:24,746 --> 00:23:26,546
You're just trying
to keep our hopes up

324
00:23:26,548 --> 00:23:28,581
because we're not getting
any bites.

325
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,584
We'll just have to hunker down.

326
00:23:30,586 --> 00:23:31,518
If we stay put,

327
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,024
I'm sure a new case will
show up before... too... long.

328
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:43,064
I'm here for you, Mystery Inc.

329
00:23:44,868 --> 00:23:46,901
Are you guys seeing this?

330
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:49,205
Ah, my wish came true.

331
00:23:52,777 --> 00:23:54,343
Uh-oh. Ahhh!

332
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:02,285
My brochures! Our guest book!

333
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:04,054
Fred, it's time to run!

334
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,129
To the Mystery Machine!

335
00:24:10,663 --> 00:24:13,033
Never mind.

336
00:24:18,105 --> 00:24:22,409
If that ghoul is here for us,
I want to be somewhere else.

337
00:24:22,411 --> 00:24:26,079
Wowie! Looks like
we got our next mystery,

338
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:27,580
and this one's got teeth!

339
00:24:27,582 --> 00:24:31,385
Good, 'cause I
might need a new set afterwards.

340
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,486
As soon as possible,

341
00:24:32,488 --> 00:24:34,922
we'll need to round up
a list of potential suspects,

342
00:24:34,924 --> 00:24:36,690
beginning with Farmer Avery

343
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:39,795
and that suspicious goat of his.

344
00:24:39,797 --> 00:24:41,296
And I'll cross reference
that list

345
00:24:41,298 --> 00:24:44,132
with any recent land deals
in the area.

346
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:45,300
Great thinking, Velma.

347
00:24:45,302 --> 00:24:48,638
No, wait. A ghost with a grudge
attacking us on Halloween.

348
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,973
There's only one person
who could be behind this.

349
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:56,413
I think it's time we pay a
visit to our old pal Coco Diablo.

350
00:24:56,415 --> 00:24:58,651
I love that idea!

351
00:24:59,018 --> 00:25:01,718
I mean, you know,
it's, um, hmm...

352
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,789
It's completely, logically
sound.

353
00:25:04,791 --> 00:25:06,991
- I like it, too.
- Really?

354
00:25:06,993 --> 00:25:08,359
But there's no time to lose.

355
00:25:08,361 --> 00:25:10,295
Because, like,
we gotta solve this case

356
00:25:10,297 --> 00:25:13,835
in time to go
trick-or-treating, right?

357
00:25:25,347 --> 00:25:29,683
Before I show you even more
of the high tech modifications

358
00:25:29,685 --> 00:25:31,452
I've made to the facility,

359
00:25:31,454 --> 00:25:32,453
I just want to say

360
00:25:32,455 --> 00:25:35,256
what a tremendous honor it is
to welcome you here.

361
00:25:35,258 --> 00:25:37,024
I'm a huge fan of Mystery Inc.

362
00:25:37,026 --> 00:25:39,027
Yeah, man,
you already said that.

363
00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:40,662
Three times already.

364
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,897
Well, I can't say it enough,

365
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:46,301
given how your mystery solving
has kept my prison at full capacity

366
00:25:46,303 --> 00:25:47,939
over the years.

367
00:25:52,944 --> 00:25:55,347
You meddling kids!

368
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:01,485
Try not to let
any of these goons upset you.

369
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:05,590
Mystery Inc?
More like mystery stink.

370
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:09,160
Shut your trap!

371
00:26:09,162 --> 00:26:11,062
How dare you disrespect
my friends like that,

372
00:26:11,064 --> 00:26:12,030
you filthy crook!

373
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:17,672
It's okay, Warden Collins.
Wasn't even a very good burn.

374
00:26:20,141 --> 00:26:21,777
I'll show them.

375
00:26:22,044 --> 00:26:24,280
I'll show them all.

376
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:31,454
Oh!

377
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,757
What are you doing, man?

378
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:38,429
Don't worry. Watch.

379
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:44,769
I'm free!

380
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,207
Watch the pretty coin of gold,

381
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,379
and you will do as you are told.

382
00:27:00,553 --> 00:27:01,986
Invisible force field.

383
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:05,591
I designed it myself.
Gets them every time.

384
00:27:05,593 --> 00:27:06,825
Oh, you got to let me show you

385
00:27:06,827 --> 00:27:08,927
our new state-of-the-art
robotic chef.

386
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:11,897
You just have to see this thing
flip pancakes!

387
00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:16,302
Raggy, did he just say pancakes?

388
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:23,143
Wait, wait, wait! No!
Like, keep it together, buddy.

389
00:27:23,145 --> 00:27:26,847
We need to stay focused.
Remember, time is candy.

390
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:30,587
Oh, right. Candy.
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!

391
00:27:31,588 --> 00:27:33,922
I'm cool. Tell him, Shaggy.

392
00:27:33,924 --> 00:27:34,990
Never thought I'd say this,

393
00:27:34,992 --> 00:27:38,427
but, man, there's no time
for pancakes today.

394
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:40,096
As fun as this tour has been,

395
00:27:40,098 --> 00:27:43,034
we're here
to talk to Coco Diablo.

396
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:48,305
Oh, of course.

397
00:27:48,307 --> 00:27:51,875
You kids, such professionals.

398
00:27:51,877 --> 00:27:53,412
Right this way.

399
00:27:55,949 --> 00:27:59,550
Anyhoo, you're lucky
you caught Miss Diablo on a day

400
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:03,456
where she doesn't have
too many press events planned.

401
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,696
Uh...

402
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:17,937
I don't mean to be rude, dude,

403
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:20,473
but we're on
a bit of a schedule here.

404
00:28:21,444 --> 00:28:24,512
No, no, I got it.

405
00:28:24,514 --> 00:28:26,249
Just give me a sec.

406
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:41,664
You have four minutes.

407
00:28:41,666 --> 00:28:45,868
Oh, heck, since it's you,
take as long as you need.

408
00:28:57,584 --> 00:29:02,656
Well, well, well.
Look who it is.

409
00:29:05,426 --> 00:29:06,894
Jinkies!

410
00:29:07,261 --> 00:29:09,695
You don't seem surprised
to see us.

411
00:29:09,697 --> 00:29:11,297
Word travels fast in here.

412
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:15,235
Heard you're having
a bit of a ghoul problem.

413
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:18,305
Hmm, you sure do know a lot

414
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:20,240
for someone
who's been locked away.

415
00:29:20,242 --> 00:29:21,375
You were behind the attack!

416
00:29:21,377 --> 00:29:24,112
Case closed.
Let's get out of here, guys.

417
00:29:25,381 --> 00:29:28,549
What makes you think
I had anything to do with it?

418
00:29:28,551 --> 00:29:29,885
Do you really expect us
to believe

419
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:33,355
that the mastermind behind
all our previous mysteries

420
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:34,957
had nothing to do with this one?

421
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:36,959
Did you see
any of my signature designs?

422
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:39,462
What mechanisms
did they use to attack you?

423
00:29:39,464 --> 00:29:43,199
Did the ghoul's clothes
have built-in pockets?

424
00:29:43,201 --> 00:29:45,168
Details matter.

425
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,002
Hmm.

426
00:29:46,004 --> 00:29:48,572
Now that you mention it, we
were kind of distracted by being...

427
00:29:48,574 --> 00:29:51,008
Terrified! His face was like...

428
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,578
And he, uh...
So we were like, "Ruh-roh!"

429
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:56,148
Normally,
I'm much more observant.

430
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:58,485
There was a lot happening
at once.

431
00:29:59,086 --> 00:30:01,052
Too bad. If I had been there,

432
00:30:01,054 --> 00:30:02,554
I bet
I could have narrowed it down

433
00:30:02,556 --> 00:30:06,192
to two or three copycats
of my work.

434
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:07,860
Wait a second. That's it!

435
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:09,862
Maybe you could help us
crack the case.

436
00:30:09,864 --> 00:30:11,999
Sure, it'll be a tight squeeze
in the van,

437
00:30:12,001 --> 00:30:14,303
but nothing we can't handle.

438
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:15,869
Right?

439
00:30:15,871 --> 00:30:17,905
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

440
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:21,843
After all, Coco is well-versed
in the minds of criminals.

441
00:30:21,845 --> 00:30:23,311
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on.

442
00:30:23,313 --> 00:30:28,383
We need to carefully
and meticulously consider this.

443
00:30:28,385 --> 00:30:30,853
Oh, boy, how long is this
going to take?

444
00:30:30,855 --> 00:30:33,622
Working with the enemy
on our first case in a year

445
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:37,396
seems like
a recipe for disaster.

446
00:30:37,729 --> 00:30:39,029
Huh...

447
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:40,365
But?

448
00:30:40,732 --> 00:30:41,832
But at the same time,

449
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:45,769
we haven't had a case
like this in some time,

450
00:30:45,771 --> 00:30:48,239
and we could be a little rusty.

451
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:51,177
A little help might be...

452
00:30:51,744 --> 00:30:55,514
- Just say it already!
- This is taking forever!

453
00:30:55,516 --> 00:31:00,819
...something to carefully
and meticulously consider.

454
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:06,593
Look, the only way
I'll agree to help

455
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:10,697
is if I could be considered
for early release.

456
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:11,899
You know, for a good behavior.

457
00:31:11,901 --> 00:31:16,537
And helping Mystery Inc. would
definitely qualify as good behavior.

458
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:20,609
But I'm just not sure
Coco can be trusted.

459
00:31:20,611 --> 00:31:21,576
Look, Fred,

460
00:31:21,578 --> 00:31:23,812
we need Coco's insights
to help identify these ghouls,

461
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:26,848
and she needs us
to vouch for her early release.

462
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,618
That's trust enough for me.

463
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,119
What do you think,
Warden Collins?

464
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:33,589
Well, it's pretty risky
for obvious reasons.

465
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,992
But if you teenagers think
it's okay,

466
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,427
who am I to argue?

467
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:40,364
But if you're leaving
the premises,

468
00:31:40,366 --> 00:31:41,965
I need a safeguard.

469
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,267
If Coco strays out of range,

470
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,102
the necessary parties
will be alerted.

471
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:48,539
We just need one of you kids
to wear the matching bracelet

472
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:50,675
and serve as home base,
if you will.

473
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:52,045
I'll do it!

474
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:57,752
What? I'm curious to see
how the technology works.

475
00:32:02,758 --> 00:32:04,457
You kids have fun.

476
00:32:04,459 --> 00:32:08,862
Scoob, we absotively posilutely
have to speed things up here.

477
00:32:08,864 --> 00:32:09,996
We've got to crack this case

478
00:32:09,998 --> 00:32:11,966
before Coco and her big ideas
slow us down.

479
00:32:11,968 --> 00:32:15,905
The clock's ticking!
Scoob, are you listening?

480
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:19,642
Scooby-Doo?

481
00:32:30,322 --> 00:32:31,721
Esteban!

482
00:32:31,723 --> 00:32:35,994
My angel of darkness!

483
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:42,034
Ahem, I mean, my angel.

484
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:51,376
Now, Coco,
if we're gonna make this work,

485
00:32:51,378 --> 00:32:52,477
you play by our rules

486
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:57,083
and don't do anything to distract
from or jeopardize this case.

487
00:32:57,085 --> 00:33:00,488
Or our plans to go
trick-or-treating tonight.

488
00:33:04,626 --> 00:33:07,861
So, what do you think
about bringing Coco along?

489
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:11,299
Oh, is she coming with us?
I hadn't noticed.

490
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:12,467
Yeah, it's just weird,

491
00:33:12,469 --> 00:33:14,969
'cause I didn't know
convicted felons were your type.

492
00:33:14,971 --> 00:33:18,940
What?
Type? Me? Please.

493
00:33:18,942 --> 00:33:21,210
Who has time for a... a type?

494
00:33:21,212 --> 00:33:22,978
We have our work cut out for us,

495
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,515
and I am focused
like a laser on...

496
00:33:26,517 --> 00:33:27,850
Okay, who am I kidding!

497
00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:32,956
I'm crushing big time, Daphne!
What do I do? What do I say?

498
00:33:32,958 --> 00:33:35,925
Don't over think it.
Just be yourself.

499
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:39,699
Oh, yeah. Easy peasy.

500
00:33:42,702 --> 00:33:48,242
Hmm. So this is where
the magic happens.

501
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:53,645
You guys really do
need help if you're driving this.

502
00:33:53,647 --> 00:33:55,214
The Mystery Machine
took a big hit,

503
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:59,152
but she's still got what it
takes to get the job done.

504
00:34:00,488 --> 00:34:02,257
Just like us.

505
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:09,463
Like, maybe we should take a
different car or a bus or something.

506
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:14,069
Are you crazy?
This is the Mystery Machine.

507
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:14,736
Oh, man!

508
00:34:14,738 --> 00:34:16,304
I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

509
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:19,508
Come on, old girl.
Fred needs a new ascot.

510
00:34:26,551 --> 00:34:28,852
Boy, listen to that baby purr.

511
00:34:28,854 --> 00:34:30,353
So, where are we headed, gang?

512
00:34:30,355 --> 00:34:32,722
Let's take Coco
to the scene of the crime.

513
00:34:32,724 --> 00:34:33,957
She might have some insights.

514
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:36,293
Hey, now is
your chance to talk to her.

515
00:34:36,295 --> 00:34:40,498
So, uh, what made you get
into the business of being bad?

516
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,367
I mean, not that there is
anything wrong with being bad.

517
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:45,504
Wait. Oh, no,
that didn't come out right.

518
00:34:45,506 --> 00:34:47,706
Good and bad are subjective.

519
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:52,644
I don't see why innovation and
helping people solve their problems

520
00:34:52,646 --> 00:34:54,114
would be considered bad.

521
00:34:54,116 --> 00:34:55,148
You are so right.

522
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,750
You know,
one time I got detention...

523
00:34:57,752 --> 00:34:59,185
Hi. Sorry to steal
my friend here,

524
00:34:59,187 --> 00:35:03,559
but I need to talk to her
about anything but this.

525
00:35:04,193 --> 00:35:06,060
Okay, you're doing great.

526
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,464
- I am?
- No.

527
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:21,012
Fred, how long
till we are there?

528
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:24,514
Uh, approximately one hour.

529
00:35:24,516 --> 00:35:29,052
I guess we can kiss all that
sweet, sweet candy goodbye.

530
00:35:29,054 --> 00:35:32,591
There's always next year.

531
00:35:37,264 --> 00:35:38,863
Let me
set the stage for you, Coco.

532
00:35:38,865 --> 00:35:43,601
Imagine an amazing
attention-grabbing booth right here.

533
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:44,869
Why would I imagine that?

534
00:35:44,871 --> 00:35:48,676
Fred thought it would be a
great way to drum up business.

535
00:35:54,516 --> 00:35:57,284
That was my reaction, too.

536
00:35:58,253 --> 00:36:00,420
Excuse me,
I'm setting the stage here.

537
00:36:00,422 --> 00:36:02,490
Anyway, there was a line
of potential clients

538
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:04,292
that stretched
all the way from here

539
00:36:04,294 --> 00:36:07,228
- to the very unpopular goat-balancing act.
- Hmm.

540
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:12,034
Sky seemed to change
colors and the air smelled like...

541
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,969
Kettle corn!

542
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,405
No, it...
it wasn't kettle corn.

543
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:19,342
- It was like, um, more of a...
- Propylene.

544
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,511
Judging by the trace amounts
of propylene glycol,

545
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:25,615
whoever's behind this
clearly lacks imagination.

546
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:29,186
So, we can assume their
techniques will be primitive.

547
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:32,690
And since ethereal torpedoes
don't actually exist,

548
00:36:32,692 --> 00:36:35,426
we're looking for
some kind of detonation device

549
00:36:35,428 --> 00:36:39,566
that was triggered
via remote control.

550
00:36:41,802 --> 00:36:42,634
Swoon.

551
00:36:42,636 --> 00:36:44,770
Oh, yeah, sure.
We already know all of that.

552
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:48,007
Look, making monsters
may be your life's work,

553
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:49,475
but catching them is ours.

554
00:36:49,477 --> 00:36:52,211
So, if you'll please
just trust our process.

555
00:36:52,213 --> 00:36:55,784
- Now, uh, where was I?
- Hold that thought.

556
00:36:56,952 --> 00:36:57,751
What is this?

557
00:36:57,753 --> 00:36:59,019
Oh, that's just our guest book

558
00:36:59,021 --> 00:37:02,156
for people to sign
and write down the mysteries

559
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:04,060
they need solved.

560
00:37:08,498 --> 00:37:09,330
Hmm.

561
00:37:09,332 --> 00:37:11,267
You'd think we would have
noticed something like that.

562
00:37:11,269 --> 00:37:13,469
- Does that name sound familiar to you?
- No.

563
00:37:13,471 --> 00:37:17,706
Whoever it is,
this Nefario is our next clue.

564
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:19,743
We are back. What did we miss?

565
00:37:19,745 --> 00:37:22,047
Did you guys solve the case?

566
00:37:25,384 --> 00:37:29,053
When I said we should
look into who this Nefario guy is,

567
00:37:29,055 --> 00:37:31,422
this isn't what I meant.

568
00:37:31,424 --> 00:37:34,025
You sure do love
boring homework.

569
00:37:34,027 --> 00:37:36,428
Pfft. Not me. I hate homework.

570
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:39,598
Never done a day of it
in my life.

571
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:46,939
Or have I? Who can say?
Because I am very mysterious.

572
00:37:51,713 --> 00:37:52,578
Ah, here it is.

573
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,619
The "Life and Crimes
of Friederich Nefario."

574
00:37:58,988 --> 00:38:00,587
Oh.

575
00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:01,656
"Deep in his castle

576
00:38:01,658 --> 00:38:03,191
high in the
Carpathian Mountains,

577
00:38:03,193 --> 00:38:07,662
Count Friederich Nefario
gathered members of high society

578
00:38:07,664 --> 00:38:08,530
from across Europe

579
00:38:08,532 --> 00:38:11,634
to form a council
with a sinister purpose.

580
00:38:11,636 --> 00:38:12,702
He called them together

581
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:14,970
because they were each
uniquely suited

582
00:38:14,972 --> 00:38:17,139
to carry out his grand plan.

583
00:38:17,141 --> 00:38:18,975
There was
his dear friend, Daisy,

584
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:21,011
a vain and spoiled socialite

585
00:38:21,013 --> 00:38:23,780
who had everything
but it was never enough.

586
00:38:23,782 --> 00:38:26,883
And Helga, a scientific
genius who knew it all.

587
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:29,921
All but the difference between
right and wrong, that is.

588
00:38:29,923 --> 00:38:34,692
And finally, Craggly and
his trusted attack dog, Rudy,

589
00:38:34,694 --> 00:38:35,961
whose insatiable appetites

590
00:38:35,963 --> 00:38:38,666
often led them
down the wrong path.

591
00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:42,534
And so, on this
fateful Halloween night,

592
00:38:42,536 --> 00:38:45,338
Nefario opened
the ancient tome and..."

593
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,175
Wait a second.

594
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:48,942
Is it just me,

595
00:38:48,944 --> 00:38:52,679
or is there something strangely
familiar about this group?

596
00:38:52,681 --> 00:38:53,514
I don't see it.

597
00:38:53,516 --> 00:38:55,549
Can we please
get back to reading?

598
00:38:55,551 --> 00:38:57,551
Yeah, the clock's ticking.

599
00:38:57,553 --> 00:39:02,124
"Nefario opened the ancient
tome and read from the sacred text,

600
00:39:02,126 --> 00:39:05,861
inviting them to join
the most enticing fellowship

601
00:39:05,863 --> 00:39:08,797
called Misery Company."

602
00:39:08,799 --> 00:39:10,833
"Upon initiation,

603
00:39:10,835 --> 00:39:13,936
they would receive
the gift of eternal life,

604
00:39:13,938 --> 00:39:15,938
not only outliving
their children,

605
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,907
but also
their children's children

606
00:39:17,909 --> 00:39:19,543
and their children's
children's children

607
00:39:19,545 --> 00:39:23,947
and their children's children's children's...
"- Man, I can't take it anymore!

608
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:24,715
Let's see here.

609
00:39:24,717 --> 00:39:27,852
"According to legend..."
blah, blah, blah.

610
00:39:27,854 --> 00:39:28,753
Aha, here it is.

611
00:39:28,755 --> 00:39:31,222
"Misery Company
got to live forever.

612
00:39:31,224 --> 00:39:32,624
But in return, they were forced

613
00:39:32,626 --> 00:39:35,728
to maintain the balance
of good and evil in the world."

614
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:37,663
So, like,
if there was too much good,

615
00:39:37,665 --> 00:39:39,965
they had to balance it out
with evil.

616
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:42,568
Then blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. Boom.

617
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:45,739
The end.
That's the clue! Move on!

618
00:39:45,741 --> 00:39:46,573
Shh!

619
00:39:46,575 --> 00:39:50,744
Need I remind you
that you are in a library?

620
00:39:50,746 --> 00:39:52,314
No!

621
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:56,884
But why would this Misery
Company be coming after us?

622
00:39:56,886 --> 00:39:57,985
It's obvious.

623
00:39:57,987 --> 00:39:59,987
You goody-goodies
disrupted the balance.

624
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:03,592
You caused there to be
too much good in the world,

625
00:40:03,594 --> 00:40:05,327
especially after catching me.

626
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:09,698
Now the ghouls are after you
to set the balance right again.

627
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,000
So, if I were you,

628
00:40:11,002 --> 00:40:14,673
I'd keep an eye out
for this Nefario guy.

629
00:40:15,106 --> 00:40:18,676
He's right behind me, isn't he?

630
00:40:18,678 --> 00:40:20,446
Mm-hmm.

631
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,517
No wires, huh?

632
00:40:25,117 --> 00:40:28,253
Can't wait to talk shop
with whoever you are

633
00:40:28,255 --> 00:40:29,187
when this is over.

634
00:40:29,189 --> 00:40:32,491
Your technique
is quite impressive.

635
00:40:34,528 --> 00:40:37,497
I'm here for you!

636
00:40:47,309 --> 00:40:48,308
On the bright side,

637
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:50,377
at least Nefario's friends
from the book

638
00:40:50,379 --> 00:40:52,549
didn't decide to join him.

639
00:40:57,687 --> 00:41:00,190
Quick. Let's split up, gang.

640
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:12,671
I'm here for you!

641
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:33,625
I'm here for you!

642
00:41:33,627 --> 00:41:34,826
Me too.

643
00:41:48,678 --> 00:41:52,447
Dude, ix-nay on the Andy-cay.

644
00:41:52,449 --> 00:41:55,250
Relax, I got this.

645
00:41:56,653 --> 00:41:59,990
Okay, but get me some, too.

646
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:03,960
Zoinks!

647
00:42:03,962 --> 00:42:05,261
Yikes!

648
00:42:22,282 --> 00:42:26,587
I don't know
how much more I can do.

649
00:42:31,892 --> 00:42:35,464
I'm here for you!

650
00:42:36,064 --> 00:42:36,863
Just kidding.

651
00:42:36,865 --> 00:42:39,866
I was built for this stuff.

652
00:42:39,868 --> 00:42:42,135
I'm gonna live forever!

653
00:42:43,338 --> 00:42:46,474
Wow, you were able to
miniaturize the turbo pump

654
00:42:46,476 --> 00:42:48,075
for the actuators?

655
00:42:48,077 --> 00:42:49,176
I'm impressed.

656
00:42:49,178 --> 00:42:50,544
Oh, that was easy.

657
00:42:50,546 --> 00:42:51,879
The hard part
was getting comfortable

658
00:42:51,881 --> 00:42:55,417
carrying rocket fuel and parts
around all day unnoticed.

659
00:42:55,419 --> 00:42:57,619
Wow, I'm being myself.

660
00:42:57,621 --> 00:42:58,553
Look out!

661
00:42:58,555 --> 00:43:02,727
I hate coming to the
library to do my homework.

662
00:43:07,432 --> 00:43:08,164
Awesome!

663
00:43:08,166 --> 00:43:12,705
Now I have an excuse
to not do my homework!

664
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,073
Like, what are we gonna do?

665
00:43:16,075 --> 00:43:20,278
Okay, gang, ahh,
this is just like old times.

666
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,146
Here's the plan.

667
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:23,682
- Let's split up and...
- We just did that!

668
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,784
Shh.

669
00:43:25,786 --> 00:43:27,053
This is all very disruptive.

670
00:43:27,055 --> 00:43:28,954
I could have you banned,
you know?

671
00:43:28,956 --> 00:43:30,658
We know.

672
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,861
So, does anyone else
have a plan?

673
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:39,032
I think we're overdue
for some good ideas.

674
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:41,668
Oh! Library puns.

675
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,571
I've got an idea.

676
00:43:43,573 --> 00:43:45,542
Yo, ghoul breath!

677
00:43:48,511 --> 00:43:50,246
Follow my lead.

678
00:43:53,084 --> 00:43:56,554
We're here for you!

679
00:43:57,888 --> 00:43:58,754
You know,

680
00:43:58,756 --> 00:44:00,623
I expect this kind of thing
from kids these days,

681
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:05,428
but someone as ancient as you
should really know better.

682
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,397
You should respect the rules!

683
00:44:07,399 --> 00:44:08,932
You should respect authority!

684
00:44:08,934 --> 00:44:12,737
You should respect the fact
that this is a library,

685
00:44:12,739 --> 00:44:18,545
and in the library,
you be quiet!

686
00:44:19,646 --> 00:44:21,281
Quick, this way.

687
00:44:26,054 --> 00:44:29,489
Oh, some help here, please.

688
00:44:30,692 --> 00:44:35,464
And don't you ever let me
catch you being loud again.

689
00:44:38,601 --> 00:44:42,972
We are here for you!

690
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,839
Shaggy, it's just a costume.

691
00:44:44,841 --> 00:44:47,008
You're gonna need
to leave it behind.

692
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,076
No, I can't do that.

693
00:44:48,078 --> 00:44:49,811
I can't trick-or-treat
without a costume.

694
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:53,082
And I can't get all that candy
unless we trick-or-treat.

695
00:44:53,084 --> 00:44:56,952
One of the great paradoxes
of the universe.

696
00:45:04,763 --> 00:45:06,930
Like, dude, that was a
lot of fun and everything.

697
00:45:06,932 --> 00:45:10,635
But I don't think we're any
closer to solving this case!

698
00:45:10,637 --> 00:45:12,136
Yeah, or trick-or-treating.

699
00:45:12,138 --> 00:45:15,406
And now, instead of one ghoul,
we've got five after us!

700
00:45:15,408 --> 00:45:19,880
What kind of dangerous road
are you leading us down, Coco?

701
00:45:22,082 --> 00:45:25,751
I'm sure that Coco made
some brilliant observations

702
00:45:25,753 --> 00:45:27,587
in the encounter we just had.

703
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:29,189
The cute one's right.

704
00:45:29,191 --> 00:45:33,159
Esteban, show them
my brilliant observations.

705
00:45:33,929 --> 00:45:38,399
Black lace. Platform boots.
Tacky cloak. Top hat.

706
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:42,305
I know who is behind this.

707
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,977
And I know
just where to find him.

708
00:46:31,894 --> 00:46:33,760
Oh, my! A customer!

709
00:46:33,762 --> 00:46:36,130
But what do I do?
What do I say?

710
00:46:36,132 --> 00:46:41,402
Just be yourself, Trevor.
Your dark and beautiful self.

711
00:46:47,144 --> 00:46:49,378
Greetings, seeker of darkness,

712
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:54,586
and welcome to Trevor Glume's
Boutique of...

713
00:46:55,353 --> 00:46:56,753
Hello, Trevor.

714
00:46:56,755 --> 00:46:58,121
...Doom.

715
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:05,362
My, my!
Look how far you've come.

716
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:08,867
I'm so proud of you.

717
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:10,402
Hello, Miss Diablo.

718
00:47:10,404 --> 00:47:14,072
Yes. A lot has changed
since you were...

719
00:47:14,074 --> 00:47:15,740
Well...

720
00:47:15,742 --> 00:47:19,013
Excuse me! Those are not food!

721
00:47:24,218 --> 00:47:26,620
Anyway, I finally
had the emotional space

722
00:47:26,622 --> 00:47:29,623
to pursue my own personal style.

723
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:33,095
Your own personal style?

724
00:47:33,629 --> 00:47:37,801
Just looks like more Dracula
costumes to me, Trevor.

725
00:47:39,936 --> 00:47:43,005
Admit it! You're trying
to steal my old business model

726
00:47:43,007 --> 00:47:46,408
while I was locked away,
unable to fend for myself!

727
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,277
I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

728
00:47:48,279 --> 00:47:54,019
I'm talking about how you've been
conspiring to destroy Mystery Inc!

729
00:47:55,487 --> 00:47:57,287
What?

730
00:47:57,289 --> 00:47:59,122
Where were you an hour ago?

731
00:47:59,124 --> 00:48:00,057
I was here

732
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:03,327
dealing with my multitudes
of satisfied customers.

733
00:48:03,329 --> 00:48:07,000
I was very busy up
until the moment you came in.

734
00:48:08,702 --> 00:48:11,305
Would you mind proving that?

735
00:48:12,006 --> 00:48:13,405
I don't think that's necessary.

736
00:48:13,407 --> 00:48:17,012
What does security footage
really prove anyway?

737
00:48:20,715 --> 00:48:22,150
Rewind it.

738
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,653
Rewind it more.

739
00:48:30,526 --> 00:48:32,528
Rewind it a lot more.

740
00:48:35,198 --> 00:48:37,032
Keep going.

741
00:48:37,034 --> 00:48:39,801
A little more.

742
00:48:39,803 --> 00:48:42,039
More.

743
00:48:42,407 --> 00:48:44,008
Stop. Go back.

744
00:48:45,576 --> 00:48:47,078
Enhance image.

745
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,748
Enhance more.

746
00:48:56,121 --> 00:49:00,224
Well, it's sad,
but it is an alibi.

747
00:49:05,198 --> 00:49:07,865
Looks like...

748
00:49:07,867 --> 00:49:09,668
- Looks like...
- Sorry.

749
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:11,503
Looks like we've hit
another dead end.

750
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,075
So much for that
early release, Coco.

751
00:49:16,077 --> 00:49:16,876
Oh, come on.

752
00:49:16,878 --> 00:49:17,977
Can you blame me for thinking

753
00:49:17,979 --> 00:49:20,513
this tacky weirdo
designed those ghoul costumes?

754
00:49:20,515 --> 00:49:23,783
Maybe you'll get
some real customers

755
00:49:23,785 --> 00:49:26,687
if you got some actual taste.

756
00:49:26,689 --> 00:49:28,722
I do have real customers.

757
00:49:28,724 --> 00:49:31,294
In fact,

758
00:49:33,730 --> 00:49:37,699
you should know that I received
the biggest order of my life

759
00:49:37,701 --> 00:49:38,767
just last week.

760
00:49:38,769 --> 00:49:41,503
Oh, sure. With who?

761
00:49:41,505 --> 00:49:42,872
Goths 'R Us?

762
00:49:42,874 --> 00:49:44,373
No, that was two weeks ago.

763
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:47,977
Last week, I sent some of
my finest Victorian creations

764
00:49:47,979 --> 00:49:51,215
directly to Coolsville Penitentiary.

765
00:49:51,217 --> 00:49:54,386
Coolsville Penitentiary?

766
00:49:54,887 --> 00:49:57,221
What are you looking at me for?

767
00:49:57,223 --> 00:49:58,122
Mr. Glume,

768
00:49:58,124 --> 00:49:59,691
could we see the paperwork
for that order?

769
00:49:59,693 --> 00:50:03,130
This is just the connection
we've been looking for.

770
00:50:04,698 --> 00:50:08,601
Looks like Coco might be
giving us the runaround after all.

771
00:50:08,603 --> 00:50:10,136
Trevor fulfilled a big order

772
00:50:10,138 --> 00:50:11,937
for someone
at the prison last week.

773
00:50:11,939 --> 00:50:15,341
And Coco just so happened to be
at the prison last week.

774
00:50:15,343 --> 00:50:17,711
I'm sure
it's just a misunderstanding.

775
00:50:17,713 --> 00:50:20,747
Man, it's Coco.
Just like I said hours ago.

776
00:50:20,749 --> 00:50:23,352
Now, can we please wrap this up?

777
00:50:24,353 --> 00:50:26,687
Ugh, what happened
to these receipts?

778
00:50:26,689 --> 00:50:28,222
They're all smudged.

779
00:50:28,224 --> 00:50:32,228
Haven't any of you
ever cried at work?

780
00:50:33,396 --> 00:50:34,830
Oh. Hey, don't worry.

781
00:50:34,832 --> 00:50:36,031
That's okay, buddy.

782
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,873
Hey, where did Coco go?

783
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:48,912
Okay, it's starting to look
less like a misunderstanding.

784
00:50:50,215 --> 00:50:52,483
Oh, man, we still
haven't solved the case,

785
00:50:52,485 --> 00:50:55,753
and now we've got to find
an escaped convict, too?

786
00:50:55,755 --> 00:50:58,691
Worst Halloween ever!

787
00:51:00,961 --> 00:51:02,863
Oh, no. Look!

788
00:51:03,197 --> 00:51:04,296
I think it's time

789
00:51:04,298 --> 00:51:08,303
we go and investigate
the old Diablo costume factory.

790
00:51:08,736 --> 00:51:09,402
Wait a second.

791
00:51:09,404 --> 00:51:11,637
Oh, for the love of
Scooby Snacks, what now?

792
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:15,074
If we're gonna do this right,
we got to do it in style.

793
00:51:15,076 --> 00:51:17,477
This is the awesome
montage part of the case

794
00:51:17,479 --> 00:51:20,314
where we spruce up
the Mystery Machine.

795
00:51:22,518 --> 00:51:23,517
Can I help?

796
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,256
I don't know.

797
00:51:27,991 --> 00:51:29,591
Oh, why not?

798
00:51:29,593 --> 00:51:32,028
Hurray.

799
00:53:25,489 --> 00:53:28,592
Well, it's not
what I expected, but...

800
00:53:29,693 --> 00:53:32,361
it's exactly what I expected.

801
00:53:32,363 --> 00:53:35,431
It is my greatest creation yet.

802
00:53:54,154 --> 00:53:55,589
Farewell.

803
00:54:39,604 --> 00:54:42,473
I suspect Coco tried to
throw us off her tracks

804
00:54:42,475 --> 00:54:44,108
by accusing Trevor Glume.

805
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:46,510
And when that backfired,
she lured us here

806
00:54:46,512 --> 00:54:48,546
so she could ambush us
at her factory.

807
00:54:48,548 --> 00:54:50,315
Where she has the upper hand.

808
00:54:50,317 --> 00:54:53,720
Coco has all her old
secret weapons here.

809
00:54:54,121 --> 00:54:56,457
We have to stay on our toes.

810
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,410
Creepy.

811
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:26,891
Oh!

812
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:32,161
Like, really creepy.

813
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:36,735
Don't worry, Shaggy and
Scooby, it's only mannequins.

814
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:41,572
Like, dude, totally knew that.

815
00:55:41,574 --> 00:55:42,507
Yeah,

816
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:44,909
we were just practicing
for the real ghouls.

817
00:55:44,911 --> 00:55:46,410
Who are probably close by.

818
00:55:46,412 --> 00:55:49,447
Maybe we should split up
and look for clues.

819
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:50,816
Really? You mean it?

820
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:53,919
Dude, whatever keeps us moving.

821
00:55:59,694 --> 00:56:04,332
No question about it, guys,
we have to split up.

822
00:56:06,468 --> 00:56:07,601
Got any aces?

823
00:56:07,603 --> 00:56:09,637
No, you took all of them.

824
00:56:09,639 --> 00:56:10,905
Wait, do you hear that?

825
00:56:10,907 --> 00:56:14,808
You're supposed
to say, "Go fish."

826
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:16,144
That sounds like...

827
00:56:16,146 --> 00:56:17,979
It was implied.

828
00:56:17,981 --> 00:56:19,249
Us!

829
00:56:19,816 --> 00:56:21,683
Do you have any Jacks?

830
00:56:21,685 --> 00:56:23,922
Go fish.

831
00:56:25,857 --> 00:56:27,390
I think you're cheating!

832
00:56:27,392 --> 00:56:31,596
What kind of fool
needs to cheat at Go Fish?

833
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:33,265
Hmm.

834
00:56:37,069 --> 00:56:39,436
We might not be
able to trick tonight,

835
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:42,542
but maybe we can still treat!

836
00:56:47,981 --> 00:56:49,682
- Oh!
- No!

837
00:56:49,684 --> 00:56:51,450
No, no, no, no!

838
00:56:51,452 --> 00:56:52,384
Just our luck!

839
00:56:52,386 --> 00:56:56,822
Why would I even need to cheat?
You have a terrible hand.

840
00:56:56,824 --> 00:56:57,623
I do?

841
00:56:57,625 --> 00:57:00,460
You're just jealous
because I'm the pretty one.

842
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:02,662
Looked in the mirror lately?

843
00:57:02,664 --> 00:57:05,165
Silence, you fools!

844
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:10,237
Time is upon us
to ambush those meddling kids.

845
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:11,405
Oh, no, what should we do?

846
00:57:11,407 --> 00:57:15,410
Let's see. We already split up
and looked for clues, so...

847
00:57:15,412 --> 00:57:17,913
Okay, here's the plan.
We need to...

848
00:57:21,051 --> 00:57:22,351
Run!

849
00:57:22,353 --> 00:57:27,258
We are here for you!

850
00:57:40,506 --> 00:57:41,406
Huh?

851
00:57:51,452 --> 00:57:52,585
Whoa!

852
00:58:07,971 --> 00:58:09,205
Whoa!

853
00:58:25,057 --> 00:58:27,791
I always knew
I was the complete package,

854
00:58:27,793 --> 00:58:29,893
but this is ridiculous.

855
00:58:29,895 --> 00:58:30,894
Help!

856
00:58:30,896 --> 00:58:32,630
Somebody help us!

857
00:58:32,632 --> 00:58:33,900
Help!

858
00:58:39,038 --> 00:58:41,239
Help! Anybody!

859
00:58:41,241 --> 00:58:44,409
Zoinks! Like, is that
what I'm think it is, Scoob?

860
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:46,311
Help us!

861
00:58:46,313 --> 00:58:47,579
Please help us!

862
00:58:47,581 --> 00:58:50,516
- Anybody help us!
- Yeah, it is.

863
00:58:50,518 --> 00:58:51,920
What do we do?

864
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,689
Mm-hmm.

865
00:58:56,691 --> 00:59:00,994
We got to do the one thing
that we don't want to do.

866
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:01,695
Oh, no.

867
00:59:01,697 --> 00:59:03,764
By giving up doing the one thing

868
00:59:03,766 --> 00:59:05,599
that we do want to do.

869
00:59:05,601 --> 00:59:06,601
You mean...

870
00:59:06,603 --> 00:59:07,904
I do!

871
00:59:09,639 --> 00:59:10,538
Hey, ghouls,

872
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,340
don't forget about me
and Scooby-Doo.

873
00:59:12,342 --> 00:59:16,212
Yeah. This whole franchise
is named after me.

874
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,655
We are here for you!

875
00:59:25,657 --> 00:59:28,859
Oh, sorry.
Thought you were somebody else.

876
00:59:28,861 --> 00:59:31,230
So long trick-or-treating.

877
00:59:39,706 --> 00:59:43,911
I guess we'll never know
who those ghouls really were.

878
00:59:48,984 --> 00:59:50,016
Robots?

879
00:59:50,018 --> 00:59:53,088
We're here for...

880
00:59:55,290 --> 00:59:56,990
So if the ghouls were robots,

881
00:59:56,992 --> 00:59:59,560
that means
someone was controlling them.

882
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:01,796
And I'm pretty sure it was...

883
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:03,132
Me.

884
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:11,239
That's right. I did it all.

885
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:12,707
I built the robots

886
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:16,045
and programmed them
to get back at you

887
01:00:16,047 --> 01:00:18,381
for taking me down.

888
01:00:18,383 --> 01:00:19,684
Huh?

889
01:00:20,118 --> 01:00:24,421
Oh, oh, and I would have
gotten away with it, too,

890
01:00:24,423 --> 01:00:28,992
if it wasn't
for you meddling kids.

891
01:00:28,994 --> 01:00:31,297
Hmm.

892
01:00:33,667 --> 01:00:36,136
Hmm.

893
01:00:37,337 --> 01:00:39,372
Hmm.

894
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:43,477
Hmm.

895
01:00:44,946 --> 01:00:47,479
Even though I suspected
you were behind it

896
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:48,347
the whole time,

897
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:51,151
something about this
doesn't feel right.

898
01:00:51,153 --> 01:00:54,287
Agreed.
Seems a little too easy.

899
01:00:54,289 --> 01:00:55,322
And this confession

900
01:00:55,324 --> 01:00:59,195
doesn't seem
like your style, Coco.

901
01:00:59,362 --> 01:01:02,697
And where is Esteban?

902
01:01:02,699 --> 01:01:04,732
Hmm.

903
01:01:04,734 --> 01:01:05,499
Hmm.

904
01:01:05,501 --> 01:01:09,073
Like, hey, I think
Scooby's on to something.

905
01:01:09,506 --> 01:01:10,873
What is it, Scooby?

906
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,810
Come on, let's follow him.

907
01:01:38,105 --> 01:01:40,706
Esteban is in here.

908
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:43,478
No! Don't look in there,
please!

909
01:01:44,145 --> 01:01:46,145
And someone else, too.

910
01:01:46,147 --> 01:01:48,082
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

911
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:49,483
I bet whoever that is

912
01:01:49,485 --> 01:01:52,388
is the one
who's really behind this.

913
01:01:54,423 --> 01:01:57,525
But, uh, just to be clear,

914
01:01:57,527 --> 01:02:00,595
when we open this door,
we'll be done with the case,

915
01:02:00,597 --> 01:02:04,032
and who knows
when the next one might...

916
01:02:04,034 --> 01:02:06,704
- Open it, Fred.
- You bet.

917
01:02:15,714 --> 01:02:17,747
Warden Collins!

918
01:02:17,749 --> 01:02:19,885
Hi, Mystery Inc.

919
01:02:20,619 --> 01:02:26,290
So, it was Warden Collins behind this
assault on Mystery Inc. the whole time?

920
01:02:26,292 --> 01:02:29,093
Only the Warden
is technologically savvy enough

921
01:02:29,095 --> 01:02:30,928
to program robots this advanced.

922
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:33,231
And, like, obsessed
with Mystery Inc. enough

923
01:02:33,233 --> 01:02:34,466
to make them look just like us.

924
01:02:34,468 --> 01:02:38,136
And only the Warden
had the ability to free Coco

925
01:02:38,138 --> 01:02:40,073
from her tracking bracelet.

926
01:02:40,075 --> 01:02:41,074
He brought her here,

927
01:02:41,076 --> 01:02:44,143
then took her adorable
kitty cat hostage...

928
01:02:44,145 --> 01:02:45,144
Not that adorable.

929
01:02:45,146 --> 01:02:48,081
...in order to force a
confession out of her.

930
01:02:48,083 --> 01:02:48,782
But why?

931
01:02:48,784 --> 01:02:51,285
You kids may not know this,
but I'm your biggest fan.

932
01:02:51,287 --> 01:02:54,521
You've given me ten times
as many inmates for my prison

933
01:02:54,523 --> 01:02:56,490
than the Coolsville
Police Department.

934
01:02:56,492 --> 01:02:59,728
Hey, now that's cold, but true.

935
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:02,797
But after putting away
Coco Diablo,

936
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:05,370
all your cases dried up.

937
01:03:05,803 --> 01:03:08,771
And when I saw
how desperate you all were

938
01:03:08,773 --> 01:03:10,473
for an exciting new mystery,

939
01:03:10,475 --> 01:03:14,780
I just wanted to do something
to repay the favor.

940
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:16,113
I wanted to give you

941
01:03:16,115 --> 01:03:20,017
the most exciting mystery
of your young lives.

942
01:03:20,019 --> 01:03:23,087
I used the technology
I perfected at my prison

943
01:03:23,089 --> 01:03:27,258
to construct the scariest
ghouls I could imagine.

944
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:31,163
Evil doppelgangers of my heroes!

945
01:03:31,165 --> 01:03:35,736
Then I carefully
planted clues all over town.

946
01:03:45,647 --> 01:03:48,015
And when
Coco Diablo got involved,

947
01:03:48,017 --> 01:03:50,951
I knew that
she would be the perfect dupe

948
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:51,886
to pin it all on

949
01:03:51,888 --> 01:03:54,889
because she was already
serving hard time.

950
01:03:54,891 --> 01:03:57,159
No harm, no foul.

951
01:03:59,997 --> 01:04:03,498
So, this was all
just a big favor for us?

952
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,533
Mm-hmm.

953
01:04:04,535 --> 01:04:08,404
Maybe there really can be
too much of a good thing.

954
01:04:08,406 --> 01:04:10,873
But you were never
in any real danger

955
01:04:10,875 --> 01:04:14,545
because I could always
turn off my evil robots

956
01:04:14,547 --> 01:04:15,946
with a push of the button.

957
01:04:15,948 --> 01:04:18,082
Oops.

958
01:04:18,084 --> 01:04:23,623
That one deactivates all the
security force fields at the prison.

959
01:04:24,124 --> 01:04:25,990
Well, turn it back on!

960
01:04:25,992 --> 01:04:27,792
Right. Of course.

961
01:04:27,794 --> 01:04:31,299
Uh, wait, wait.
Which one was that again?

962
01:04:31,566 --> 01:04:33,634
Uh... Wait, wait, wait. Uh...

963
01:04:35,069 --> 01:04:36,304
Oops.

964
01:04:39,341 --> 01:04:40,607
What's this now?

965
01:04:40,609 --> 01:04:44,279
Another one
of the warden's tricks?

966
01:04:48,284 --> 01:04:50,218
It's a Halloween miracle!

967
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:53,654
We're free. Free!

968
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:56,694
Free!

969
01:05:09,741 --> 01:05:13,042
I think "oops" is the
wrong word, Warden.

970
01:05:13,044 --> 01:05:16,013
I know,
but this is a family movie.

971
01:05:16,015 --> 01:05:16,914
All right, gang,

972
01:05:16,916 --> 01:05:20,417
it looks like our work
isn't even close to done.

973
01:05:20,419 --> 01:05:24,055
Maybe you should try
not to look so happy.

974
01:05:24,057 --> 01:05:25,590
You're right, Shaggy.

975
01:05:25,592 --> 01:05:28,693
That's something
that I'm working on.

976
01:05:28,695 --> 01:05:29,728
We've got to do something.

977
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:32,098
But we're no match
against so many villains.

978
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:35,501
Yeah, you'd have to have
some kind of super powers

979
01:05:35,503 --> 01:05:36,502
to stand a chance.

980
01:05:36,504 --> 01:05:39,173
But don't worry, kids,
Coolsville Police Department...

981
01:05:39,175 --> 01:05:42,309
I might be
able to help with that.

982
01:05:42,311 --> 01:05:44,046
Esteban.

983
01:05:53,156 --> 01:05:54,022
Like, Scoob,

984
01:05:54,024 --> 01:05:56,928
maybe we didn't miss out
on Halloween after all.

985
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,066
Uh-uh, no way.

986
01:06:04,068 --> 01:06:08,173
Like, come on, Scoob,
it's the only costume left.

987
01:06:13,746 --> 01:06:17,248
Come on, Scoob,
you're ruining it for everyone.

988
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:17,949
Humph.

989
01:06:20,587 --> 01:06:23,488
Give it to me,
you little banister biter!

990
01:06:24,525 --> 01:06:27,995
Hey, you didn't say
trick-or-treat!

991
01:06:28,462 --> 01:06:30,162
Ha-ha, too easy!

992
01:06:30,164 --> 01:06:31,833
Mommy!

993
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:33,199
Mine!

994
01:06:39,208 --> 01:06:44,578
Okay, gang, let's split up,
and nab us some convicts.

995
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,616
Hey, there's one now.

996
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:48,216
Hope you miss prison food

997
01:06:48,218 --> 01:06:50,821
because you're going
right back to...

998
01:06:51,388 --> 01:06:52,654
Oh, apologies.

999
01:06:52,656 --> 01:06:55,323
You have
a very convincing costume.

1000
01:06:55,325 --> 01:06:58,094
Have a great night.
And stay safe.

1001
01:06:58,096 --> 01:07:01,664
Geesh. Grown-ups. Go figure.

1002
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:04,937
Come on, gang,
let's get to work.

1003
01:07:10,409 --> 01:07:12,645
Hello, children.

1004
01:07:13,046 --> 01:07:15,046
Not much exercise in jail.

1005
01:07:15,048 --> 01:07:19,250
That candy you're holding
looks quite valuable to me.

1006
01:07:19,252 --> 01:07:23,222
I'll appraise it and offer you
a competitive price for it.

1007
01:07:23,224 --> 01:07:25,324
What are you talking about,
mister?

1008
01:07:25,326 --> 01:07:28,227
It's called stealing, kid.

1009
01:07:28,229 --> 01:07:29,695
Wait! What's it worth?

1010
01:07:29,697 --> 01:07:32,299
Now,
if I were an escaped convict,

1011
01:07:32,301 --> 01:07:33,600
where would I hide?

1012
01:07:33,602 --> 01:07:34,668
Oh!

1013
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:38,004
Hey, Mr. Wickles,
what a night for a knight, huh?

1014
01:07:38,006 --> 01:07:39,573
Is this that karma

1015
01:07:39,575 --> 01:07:42,812
everybody's
always talking about?

1016
01:07:47,284 --> 01:07:48,886
Huh? What the...

1017
01:07:50,087 --> 01:07:52,321
Oh! It can't be!

1018
01:07:52,323 --> 01:07:53,422
Sorry, Captain Cutler.

1019
01:07:53,424 --> 01:07:57,862
Didn't mean to dampen
your Halloween spirit.

1020
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:05,736
Boo!

1021
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:15,146
Oh, Henry Bascombe,
you were always such a scream.

1022
01:08:15,148 --> 01:08:20,185
You want to
give me all your candy.

1023
01:08:20,187 --> 01:08:24,223
We want to give you
all our candy.

1024
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:28,828
Wouldn't you rather
teach this evil doer a lesson?

1025
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:29,896
Yes!

1026
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:30,964
No. No!

1027
01:08:30,966 --> 01:08:32,632
My work here is done.

1028
01:08:37,005 --> 01:08:40,910
Hand over all of that
there candy or else.

1029
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:44,946
Kitty!

1030
01:08:44,948 --> 01:08:48,751
Oh, such a sweet little
shmochy-woochie.

1031
01:08:48,753 --> 01:08:51,122
Yes, you are.

1032
01:08:52,256 --> 01:08:53,989
Forgot I'm allergic.

1033
01:08:56,561 --> 01:08:58,296
Dagnabbit!

1034
01:09:01,566 --> 01:09:04,137
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

1035
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:42,043
Wow,
look at us. We did it.

1036
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:44,646
Coco's costumes
sure were a big help.

1037
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:47,216
When you use these costumes
for good,

1038
01:09:47,218 --> 01:09:48,350
they're not all bad.

1039
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:52,288
Okay, time to take this
riff-raff back to prison.

1040
01:09:55,494 --> 01:09:58,161
Now, when I call your name,
please say...

1041
01:09:58,163 --> 01:10:01,064
Not so fast!
Empty your pockets!

1042
01:10:11,845 --> 01:10:16,016
Do as the scrawny
hippy commands!

1043
01:10:26,094 --> 01:10:28,461
You know you can't
eat that candy, right?

1044
01:10:28,463 --> 01:10:29,295
It's stolen.

1045
01:10:29,297 --> 01:10:33,834
But, like, didn't you say
good and bad are subjective?

1046
01:10:33,836 --> 01:10:35,336
Only when it applies to me.

1047
01:10:35,338 --> 01:10:40,811
- Oh, so close!
- Yet so far away.

1048
01:10:47,819 --> 01:10:48,751
For some reason,

1049
01:10:48,753 --> 01:10:50,653
everyone thinks
I'm wearing a costume

1050
01:10:50,655 --> 01:10:52,824
and keeps giving me candy.

1051
01:10:53,691 --> 01:10:56,927
I'm on a strict liver
and goat-milk regimen,

1052
01:10:56,929 --> 01:10:59,398
but I thought
you two might enjoy it.

1053
01:11:00,799 --> 01:11:02,266
You know, Trevor,

1054
01:11:02,268 --> 01:11:04,369
despite your dark
and gloomy exterior,

1055
01:11:04,371 --> 01:11:07,839
deep down, you're a
golden ray of sunshine.

1056
01:11:07,841 --> 01:11:09,941
You... you really think so?

1057
01:11:09,943 --> 01:11:12,278
Like, no question about it, man.

1058
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,015
Absolutely.

1059
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:20,119
Well, how about that?
You were totally right!

1060
01:11:25,294 --> 01:11:27,262
Catch you dudes later!

1061
01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:30,765
Thanks for your help today.

1062
01:11:30,767 --> 01:11:34,035
I'd like to think that under
different circumstances,

1063
01:11:34,037 --> 01:11:35,636
we'd really get along.

1064
01:11:35,638 --> 01:11:36,571
Oh, really?

1065
01:11:36,573 --> 01:11:39,374
Oh, there I go
saying the wrong thing again.

1066
01:11:39,376 --> 01:11:42,177
No, it's just that I thought
we got along great.

1067
01:11:42,179 --> 01:11:43,879
Do you know
how rare it is for me

1068
01:11:43,881 --> 01:11:47,118
to like someone
other than myself?

1069
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,921
Jinkies!

1070
01:11:53,692 --> 01:11:58,297
My glasses.
I can't find my glasses.

1071
01:12:04,304 --> 01:12:05,505
Friends.

1072
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:08,342
No.

1073
01:12:09,476 --> 01:12:11,078
Agreed.

1074
01:12:16,217 --> 01:12:18,951
So, I've been meaning
to talk to you, Freddy.

1075
01:12:18,953 --> 01:12:23,256
I was thinking about,
you know, my role in the gang.

1076
01:12:23,258 --> 01:12:24,257
What do you mean?

1077
01:12:24,259 --> 01:12:25,325
No offense, Fred,

1078
01:12:25,327 --> 01:12:27,294
but I think I should be
the leader of Mystery Inc.,

1079
01:12:27,296 --> 01:12:27,995
not you.

1080
01:12:27,997 --> 01:12:29,697
Whoa!
That's a strange thing to say.

1081
01:12:29,699 --> 01:12:32,166
I'm sorry. I know it sounds
crazy, but I just feel like...

1082
01:12:32,168 --> 01:12:35,870
But, Daphne, you've always been
the leader of Mystery Inc.

1083
01:12:35,872 --> 01:12:37,038
Wait, seriously?

1084
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,474
You remain calm under pressure,

1085
01:12:38,476 --> 01:12:41,744
you're the person that
everyone turns to for advice,

1086
01:12:41,746 --> 01:12:43,779
and you make it all
look effortless.

1087
01:12:43,781 --> 01:12:45,581
That's what a true leader does.

1088
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:48,218
Inspires others
to do their best,

1089
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:49,285
and leads by example.

1090
01:12:49,287 --> 01:12:52,355
I have a much more important
and prestigious duty

1091
01:12:52,357 --> 01:12:54,693
of driving the van!

1092
01:13:00,133 --> 01:13:01,932
Like, if tonight
has taught us anything,

1093
01:13:01,934 --> 01:13:06,872
it's that you really can have
too much of a good thing.

1094
01:13:06,874 --> 01:13:07,773
Right, Scooby-Doo?

1095
01:13:07,775 --> 01:13:11,109
Another great paradox
of the universe.

1096
01:13:11,111 --> 01:13:13,212
Well, with this case
all wrapped up,

1097
01:13:13,214 --> 01:13:15,081
Coco Diablo back behind bars,

1098
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:17,150
and the prison
getting a new warden...

1099
01:13:17,152 --> 01:13:20,988
Wait, Charlie Humdrum,
the tax accountant?

1100
01:13:20,990 --> 01:13:23,424
I'm used to
working with criminals.

1101
01:13:23,426 --> 01:13:27,394
I guess things will go back
to being pretty quiet again

1102
01:13:27,396 --> 01:13:28,629
in Coolsville.

1103
01:13:28,631 --> 01:13:30,765
Not necessarily!

1104
01:13:30,767 --> 01:13:33,435
I got to say
whatever magic this is,

1105
01:13:33,437 --> 01:13:35,170
you did a bang-up job.

1106
01:13:35,172 --> 01:13:36,137
I wish for more cases,

1107
01:13:36,139 --> 01:13:38,407
as many cases
as you can throw our way.

1108
01:13:38,409 --> 01:13:41,711
Big cases, spooky cases,
wild cases, we're ready!

1109
01:13:41,713 --> 01:13:45,748
Thanks, wishing well.
And hey, Happy Halloween.
