1
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:34,497
Your focus is off.

2
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:37,498
I can't do it,
grandfather.

3
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,259
I know what
is expected of me.

4
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:43,265
I'm just a shepherd.

5
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:04,732
Sit down.

6
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:11,129
I'm going to tell you a story
about hope, about trust,

7
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:18,131
about faith when we don't
understand God's plan.

8
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:21,422
It was the time
of the Judges.

9
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:23,431
The people were corrupt
and everyone did

10
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,294
as they saw fit.

11
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:29,195
When a great famine came upon
Israel, some families chose

12
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:32,561
to escape their plight and start
over in the pagan country

13
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,256
of Moab.

14
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:37,763
But soon Moab proved
to be none the better.

15
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:40,797
The crops withered
and the people suffered,

16
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:43,797
for there was no rain.

17
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:00,297
I miss you.

18
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:06,924
A miracle happened last night.

19
00:03:07,032 --> 00:03:13,658
I awoke with a song in my heart,
a song only God could have

20
00:03:13,765 --> 00:03:20,096
put there, a song that reminded
me of you, Elimelech.

21
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:27,529
For so long, I thought I would
never find peace again, but God

22
00:03:27,632 --> 00:03:35,997
has given me that peace to
handle the memories of you.

23
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:40,030
I love you, husband.

24
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:56,956
God, thank You for that song,
thank You for that comfort.

25
00:03:57,065 --> 00:04:02,964
I now ask that You give
that same comfort to my family.

26
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:07,157
Nothing grows here anymore.

27
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:11,754
My sons work day and night
in the field and still...

28
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:20,129
Nothing.

29
00:04:22,864 --> 00:04:29,127
We're all so hungry,
but we will not give up.

30
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,622
You have healed my heart.

31
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:40,288
I know You can heal our land.

32
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:44,295
Please heal our land.

33
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:06,596
How did you get here?

34
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:13,526
Thank You, God, for allowing
something so beautiful to grow

35
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,256
in such a place.

36
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:19,955
Naomi, come quick.

37
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:21,962
It is Chilion.

38
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:07,761
Here, let me take him.

39
00:06:16,263 --> 00:06:21,059
God, this must be a dream.

40
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:24,856
It's no dream, mother.

41
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:29,156
This town's put a curse
on this family.

42
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:38,027
Orpah, what happened?

43
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:39,754
He fainted.

44
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:43,726
His head fell against the well.

45
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:47,955
He'd been working out in
the fields all day and night

46
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,688
with nothing to eat.

47
00:06:54,629 --> 00:07:00,721
Oh, oh, God, why did You
allow this to happen?

48
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:09,423
We never should have come
to this country.

49
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,427
Father should have kept us
in Bethlehem.

50
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:16,427
Oh, oh.

51
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,026
oh!

52
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:45,753
Oh, it feels good to be out
again.

53
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:47,554
Oh, doesn’t it?

54
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:51,355
Sometimes you just need a change
of scenery, just to step up

55
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:53,518
from your troubles.

56
00:07:53,628 --> 00:07:56,186
I hoped Orpah would come out
today as well.

57
00:07:56,295 --> 00:07:59,193
It s been 10 months since
Chilion passed.

58
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:01,988
Can't seem to get her
out of the house.

59
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:06,152
We all deal with it
in different ways.

60
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:13,190
Why did you put that back?

61
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:15,090
Wishful thinking.

62
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,024
We don’t have enough to spend.

63
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:21,355
We have enough, Ruth,
get what you want.

64
00:08:21,461 --> 00:08:23,359
I cannot.

65
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:30,950
Ruth, choose what's best
for you.

66
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:36,917
What do you think of this?

67
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:40,721
It doesn't matter what
I think, get what you want.

68
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,622
All right, take that one.

69
00:08:45,727 --> 00:08:48,421
It brings out your eyes.

70
00:08:50,727 --> 00:08:54,853
Praise be the gods, Naomi,
what are you doing out today?

71
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,790
Well, I thought we both
needed a smile today.

72
00:08:59,894 --> 00:09:02,292
Well, a woman in your
situation should not be

73
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:04,053
out on the town.

74
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:08,150
If I had lost my husband and my
eldest son, I would be at

75
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:12,159
the temple praying to the gods.

76
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:15,056
My God does not reside
in the temple,

77
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:19,025
He resides in my heart.

78
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:23,957
I hear your crops are rather
small again this year.

79
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:26,027
And I certainly hope that
nothing happens to Mahlon

80
00:09:26,126 --> 00:09:29,286
as well, otherwise,
how do you intend

81
00:09:29,393 --> 00:09:32,223
to provide for my daughter?

82
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:33,656
God will provide.

83
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,692
I hope so.

84
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:39,590
After all, I can't imagine her
alone and desolate in this

85
00:09:39,694 --> 00:09:41,660
world with no husband.

86
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,658
Mother.

87
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:48,159
Come.

88
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,385
Dinner won't make itself.

89
00:09:50,493 --> 00:09:54,289
Perhaps your God will
make it.

90
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:05,454
Perhaps I should start
making sacrifices to the gods.

91
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,526
Our fields will not prosper
simply because they are washed

92
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:10,388
in blood.

93
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:13,152
Mahlon works in the fields
and nothing grows.

94
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,851
Look in the fields where
Molech stands.

95
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:21,290
Molech, nor any of the other
God of Moab is the answer.

96
00:10:21,392 --> 00:10:25,223
Then why haven't you been
blessed in this place?

97
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:31,020
I have been blessed,
for my son found you.

98
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,718
I'll see if Orpah needs
help with dinner.

99
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,984
Yes.

100
00:11:02,426 --> 00:11:03,483
Go inside, mother.

101
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:06,683
I will be done shortly.

102
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:07,917
You look weak.

103
00:11:08,025 --> 00:11:08,752
You need rest.

104
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:10,381
My strength is fine.

105
00:11:10,492 --> 00:11:11,889
It is the field that is weak.

106
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:16,550
Let it be for now,
God will take care of it.

107
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:20,613
Is that what you told
Chilion?

108
00:11:24,758 --> 00:11:26,452
He will take care of this.

109
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:29,218
God will never give us any more
than we can handle.

110
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:31,620
Then where is He?

111
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:43,587
I work hard and I am good
to my family just like father.

112
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:47,852
What more does God require
for us to be blessed?

113
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,947
All He asks for is our trust.

114
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:53,718
Trust?

115
00:11:53,825 --> 00:11:55,654
Mother, how do you trust
when you can't even see

116
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:58,724
who's leading you?

117
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:02,984
What if the people of Moab
are right?

118
00:12:03,091 --> 00:12:05,023
What if we are following
the wrong God?

119
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:10,421
Oh, no, He is real, Mahlon,
our God is not this God that

120
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:12,252
you speak of.

121
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:15,949
He is real.

122
00:12:17,324 --> 00:12:21,450
Mahlon, you must keep
your faith.

123
00:12:27,391 --> 00:12:30,686
I'm telling you this family
is cursed.

124
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,587
Shh, you want mother
to hear you say that?

125
00:12:34,691 --> 00:12:36,782
Naomi is not my mother.

126
00:12:36,891 --> 00:12:39,221
I told her once Chilion died,
she could stop calling me

127
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:41,551
daughter.

128
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:44,249
I'm going back to live
with my family.

129
00:12:44,358 --> 00:12:46,381
You're just going to leave?

130
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,615
You forget, we have obligations
to Naomi.

131
00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:51,690
We are her family.

132
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:55,382
I have no obligations
anymore.

133
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:58,479
Naomi and the Israelites do
not believe as we believe.

134
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,681
That is why this family is
cursed.

135
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:04,154
Naomi has been good to us.

136
00:13:04,257 --> 00:13:06,815
My parents never should have
arranged this.

137
00:13:06,924 --> 00:13:08,947
It was a mistake to marry
an Israelite.

138
00:13:09,058 --> 00:13:11,615
Naomi would do anything
for you.

139
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:17,452
Ruth... I'm realizing that I
no longer want what she has

140
00:13:17,557 --> 00:13:18,818
to give.

141
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:22,356
Orpah, it is our duty
to be good to her.

142
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:24,855
We are her daughters through
marriage.

143
00:13:24,956 --> 00:13:27,354
It's not only the right thing
to do, it's the custom,

144
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:28,684
it's law.

145
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:31,655
Don not lecture me about
the laws of Moab.

146
00:13:31,757 --> 00:13:35,086
I don't see you making any
sacrifices to appease the gods.

147
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:40,088
All she wants is our love
and support, not rituals.

148
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,849
As long as we're under her
roof, we should not be making

149
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:46,718
sacrifices.

150
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:55,151
Then I'll no longer be
under her roof.

151
00:13:55,257 --> 00:13:58,882
I'm going back to what
I believe.

152
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,885
Isn't there a part of you
that believes something beyond

153
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,285
our gods, something better?

154
00:14:13,256 --> 00:14:15,086
Where's Mahlon?

155
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,781
He is still working.

156
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,720
Perhaps you can go
and talk to him.

157
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:41,318
come inside and eat with us.

158
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,048
Ruth, I must finish this.

159
00:14:44,156 --> 00:14:48,646
Mahlon, please.

160
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:05,283
When will things change
for this family?

161
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:06,581
Soon.

162
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:09,087
It'll only be hard
for a season.

163
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:12,246
When will the season end?

164
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:14,412
I'm beginning to think your
people are right when they say

165
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:17,784
our family’s being punished.

166
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:20,912
I do not believe people who
slay the innocent to please

167
00:15:21,022 --> 00:15:27,887
the gods have a right to choose
who should be punished.

168
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:37,844
I do not know what to do
anymore.

169
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:44,387
I could always become
a temple maiden.

170
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:46,215
No.

171
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,287
I don’t want you have any part
of that.

172
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:55,252
Neither do I but I have to
believe it all will work out.

173
00:15:57,321 --> 00:16:00,617
You sound just like my
mother.

174
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:02,517
Come inside.

175
00:16:02,622 --> 00:16:06,988
The field can wait,
but dinner cannot.

176
00:16:06,988 --> 00:16:07,249
The field can wait,
but dinner cannot.

177
00:20:44,818 --> 00:20:48,977
oh, God.

178
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:53,039
Why?

179
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:56,117
Why did You not take me?

180
00:20:56,217 --> 00:21:00,115
Why am I the only one left?

181
00:21:13,084 --> 00:21:17,539
I swear there was no priest,
and at a funeral.

182
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,116
No wonder she's lost her
entire family.

183
00:21:20,217 --> 00:21:22,774
She's angry at the gods.

184
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:23,542
Oh, Orpah.

185
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,673
Come here.

186
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:26,579
Come.

187
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:28,479
She can tell you all about
that woman

188
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:30,242
She was her other
daughter in law.

189
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,441
Hello Beth.

190
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,539
Your poor parents.

191
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,115
Why they must be just as
distraught as I am about

192
00:21:37,216 --> 00:21:40,808
arranging you into that family.

193
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:43,610
Why the only good to come
of it is that neither you

194
00:21:43,717 --> 00:21:46,148
nor Ruth ever conceived.

195
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,079
Someday I plan to remarry.

196
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:51,240
But, of course, you will.

197
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,544
But two barren daughters
in one household.

198
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,673
Well, I hope Naomi at least
learns from this and tries to

199
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:59,340
make peace with the gods.

200
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,211
Mother!

201
00:22:00,316 --> 00:22:03,305
Ruth.

202
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:09,043
Your husband has left you
empty handed and neither of you

203
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:11,514
have any children to support
you.

204
00:22:11,617 --> 00:22:15,515
If that isn't a curse,
then what is?

205
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:18,481
Stop it, mother.

206
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:21,980
Ruth, come please.

207
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:26,447
Go buy some us some nice fruit.

208
00:22:29,316 --> 00:22:31,248
May I speak, Beth?

209
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,213
Of course, Naomi.

210
00:22:33,316 --> 00:22:37,839
Ruth held her tongue out of
respect for you as her mother,

211
00:22:37,949 --> 00:22:41,574
but you are not my mother and I
will not allow you to dishonor

212
00:22:41,683 --> 00:22:46,240
my family or my God with your
words.

213
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:53,271
If you have no kind words,
then please, be silent.

214
00:22:54,816 --> 00:22:58,680
I pray you all have
a blessed day.

215
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:41,306
Oh, my baby.

216
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:48,106
Where are You?

217
00:23:48,215 --> 00:23:53,306
Why have You allowed this
to happen?

218
00:23:53,415 --> 00:24:00,507
I followed my husband here
because I was supposed to.

219
00:24:00,615 --> 00:24:05,014
I knew we were not supposed
to come here, but why did You

220
00:24:05,114 --> 00:24:07,376
take my children?

221
00:24:07,481 --> 00:24:08,845
It was my fault.

222
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:13,846
Why did You take my babies?

223
00:24:17,715 --> 00:24:22,170
I do not understand.

224
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:25,008
Help me.

225
00:24:25,114 --> 00:24:27,307
Help me see this.

226
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:31,404
Mother.

227
00:24:31,515 --> 00:24:33,378
Are you all right?

228
00:24:33,481 --> 00:24:35,310
Yes, I'm fine.

229
00:24:35,415 --> 00:24:38,472
I'll be there in a minute.

230
00:24:38,581 --> 00:24:46,105
Naomi, spouse of Elimelech
of the house of Bethlehem.

231
00:24:51,148 --> 00:25:01,741
I am-- I am-- I am Caleb,
a servant of your friend, Tani.

232
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:04,006
She wishes to offer you
condolences for the loss

233
00:25:04,114 --> 00:25:06,046
of your sons.

234
00:25:06,148 --> 00:25:08,636
She would have sent me earlier,
but she did not get word

235
00:25:08,747 --> 00:25:10,508
until a few days ago.

236
00:25:10,614 --> 00:25:13,637
Tell her I said thank you
and that I wish her well

237
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:14,940
I will do as you ask.

238
00:25:15,048 --> 00:25:15,843
Would you come inside?

239
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,708
We prepared food.

240
00:25:17,814 --> 00:25:25,042
Oh, I wish I could stay,
but I have to be on my way

241
00:25:25,147 --> 00:25:28,545
Caleb, how is Tani?

242
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:30,374
She is quite well

243
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,036
The famine is over.

244
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:35,477
God has delivered us
and healed our land.

245
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,034
It is truly miraculous.

246
00:25:39,147 --> 00:25:43,341
That is wonderful news.

247
00:25:43,447 --> 00:25:47,379
Tell her I appreciate her
comfort.

248
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,309
Go with God, Caleb.

249
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:53,312
Thank you, Naomi, I will.

250
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:08,307
Oh, thank You Lord, for
showing mercy to your people

251
00:26:08,413 --> 00:26:11,811
even though they did not
deserve it.

252
00:26:11,913 --> 00:26:16,175
So this is what you call
a sign of your God's mercy

253
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,178
that Israel's famine is over.

254
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,007
Yes, Ruth.

255
00:26:20,113 --> 00:26:24,068
It is a sign of great mercy.

256
00:26:28,013 --> 00:26:31,843
Orpah, what's wrong?

257
00:26:31,946 --> 00:26:35,503
- I--
- What is it, Orpah?

258
00:26:35,613 --> 00:26:40,375
- I'm--
- What is it?

259
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:48,139
I'm sorry.

260
00:26:48,246 --> 00:26:52,508
I'm sorry for how the women
treated you but most

261
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:56,772
importantly, I'm sorry
that I did not stand by you.

262
00:26:56,879 --> 00:27:01,505
Oh, Orpah, it is all right
and you are not my servant.

263
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:06,375
You do not need to kneel
in front of me.

264
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:10,138
You’ve been so good to me
even though I do not

265
00:27:10,246 --> 00:27:11,337
deserve it.

266
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:17,674
You have a wonderful heart,
Orpah, a wonderful heart.

267
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:24,871
I may not have always shown
you love, but I will.

268
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:28,241
I vow to be forever obedient
to you.

269
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:33,937
You do not need to vow
anything to me.

270
00:27:34,046 --> 00:27:38,239
My love is with you always.

271
00:27:38,345 --> 00:27:40,709
Now enough talk of regret.

272
00:27:40,812 --> 00:27:41,937
I'm hungry.

273
00:27:42,046 --> 00:27:44,944
Come, let us sit and eat.

274
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:55,174
I could not believe
the way my mother acted.

275
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:56,505
Ruth.

276
00:27:56,612 --> 00:27:59,510
I have never seen you
so angry before.

277
00:27:59,612 --> 00:28:02,578
You should have seen your face.

278
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:05,543
It was so, so
the opposite of beautiful?

279
00:28:05,645 --> 00:28:09,042
Yes.

280
00:28:26,045 --> 00:28:32,000
Lord, thank You for this
food and bless my two beautiful

281
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:34,872
daughters.

282
00:28:34,978 --> 00:28:37,274
Amen.

283
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:51,576
Tomorrow I will be leaving.

284
00:28:51,678 --> 00:28:55,076
I feel that God is telling me
to go home.

285
00:28:55,177 --> 00:29:00,075
The famine in Israel is over
and I will go home to find

286
00:29:00,177 --> 00:29:02,575
peace.

287
00:29:02,678 --> 00:29:06,007
I agree, a fresh start
in a new town.

288
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:11,839
Oh, Ruth, you have goes way
beyond what is expected of you.

289
00:29:11,943 --> 00:29:14,705
When I enter my homeland,
the bonds and laws made here

290
00:29:14,811 --> 00:29:17,777
will no longer apply.

291
00:29:17,877 --> 00:29:21,002
I cannot expect you to go
with me.

292
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:25,440
Of course I will go
with you.

293
00:29:25,544 --> 00:29:27,668
We will go with you.

294
00:29:27,777 --> 00:29:30,675
No.

295
00:29:30,777 --> 00:29:35,607
You will stay because you will
find support here and I will go

296
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:39,699
to Bethlehem to seek mine.

297
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,402
We are family and we will
leave as family.

298
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,272
No, Ruth.

299
00:29:43,377 --> 00:29:47,536
- I can't--
- Mother, we need to be

300
00:29:47,643 --> 00:29:51,041
with you.

301
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:21,101
Tell us what Bethlehem's
like, Naomi.

302
00:30:22,677 --> 00:30:25,472
Naomi?

303
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:32,337
Is something troubling you?

304
00:30:32,443 --> 00:30:34,409
No.

305
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,442
This is not fair.

306
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,735
I cannot do this.

307
00:30:38,842 --> 00:30:40,308
You can do this.

308
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:43,705
We will help you.

309
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,036
No.

310
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:48,666
I cannot do this.

311
00:30:48,776 --> 00:30:51,334
Do not follow me any further.

312
00:30:51,443 --> 00:30:53,965
Go home to your real mothers.

313
00:30:54,076 --> 00:30:56,541
No, no, I will not.

314
00:30:56,642 --> 00:31:01,904
Coming with me to Bethlehem,
there's no future for you there.

315
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:04,168
I will be all right.

316
00:31:04,276 --> 00:31:07,435
This is my burden, mine alone.

317
00:31:07,542 --> 00:31:10,008
I will be all right.

318
00:31:10,109 --> 00:31:12,904
Go back to your families
and start over.

319
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:14,032
Mother.

320
00:31:14,143 --> 00:31:18,438
Ruth, I am not your mother.

321
00:31:19,776 --> 00:31:25,470
But you have cared for me
in ways she never has.

322
00:31:25,575 --> 00:31:30,405
Oh, Ruth, I love you.

323
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:33,566
Look at me.

324
00:31:33,676 --> 00:31:38,074
Look at me.

325
00:31:38,175 --> 00:31:41,664
I have nothing more to give you.

326
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:44,537
My sons are dead.

327
00:31:44,642 --> 00:31:49,574
There will be no more children,
no one to support you.

328
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:54,335
And if by some miracle, I were
able to bear children again,

329
00:31:54,442 --> 00:31:59,601
more sons, when it is time
to marry again, would you have

330
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:02,470
waited?

331
00:32:02,574 --> 00:32:03,972
I will wait.

332
00:32:04,075 --> 00:32:06,166
I will wait forever.

333
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:09,900
No, that is youth talking,
and I will not take that

334
00:32:10,008 --> 00:32:11,769
from you.

335
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:15,807
You have a chance to marry
again here.

336
00:32:15,908 --> 00:32:19,772
I need to return to Bethlehem
to seek the Lord s favor

337
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:24,069
for I know his hand has been
put against me.

338
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:26,164
I will be all right.

339
00:32:26,274 --> 00:32:31,037
You do not need to take care
of me anymore.

340
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:43,305
You are truly the one
who is kind.

341
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:08,633
What you have given me
will stay with me forever.

342
00:33:25,974 --> 00:33:29,270
Orpah!

343
00:33:32,774 --> 00:33:33,705
I know it's hard.

344
00:33:33,807 --> 00:33:35,295
I cannot go back.

345
00:33:35,407 --> 00:33:37,169
Ruth, she's allowing us
to move on.

346
00:33:37,273 --> 00:33:38,296
But she's so alone.

347
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,930
She's lost everything.

348
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:43,632
Ruth, she says she doesn’t
need your help.

349
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,138
She says need, but she means
want and although she may not

350
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,104
want my help, she does need it.

351
00:33:52,206 --> 00:33:55,639
She will not live much longer
if she continues by herself

352
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,364
alone.

353
00:33:56,473 --> 00:34:00,064
And neither will you going
off to a strange land.

354
00:34:00,173 --> 00:34:04,901
Orpah, I must do what I feel
is right.

355
00:34:05,006 --> 00:34:08,131
What will I tell Beth,
your mother?

356
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,729
Tell her I'm with Naomi.

357
00:34:10,839 --> 00:34:14,931
Tell her I am no longer
empty handed.

358
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,105
Mother!

359
00:34:33,206 --> 00:34:36,694
Wait!

360
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:39,329
Mother!

361
00:34:43,472 --> 00:34:47,837
Oh!

362
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:51,427
Do not force me back to Moab.

363
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:54,869
I will not leave you.

364
00:34:54,973 --> 00:34:58,268
I want to follow you.

365
00:34:58,372 --> 00:35:02,168
Where you go, I will go.

366
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:06,034
Where you live, I will live.

367
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:11,504
Your people will be my people.

368
00:35:11,606 --> 00:35:20,733
And your God... your God will be
my God.

369
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:32,862
Oh, Ruth.

370
00:35:32,972 --> 00:35:36,870
You are truly a gift.

371
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:37,092
The road was long and wore
down the two women.

372
00:38:37,202 --> 00:38:39,259
They are fortunes for God.

373
00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:43,233
They were now penniless as they
entered their now home

374
00:38:43,336 --> 00:38:47,995
and witnessed the wonders
of the bounty in Israel.

375
00:38:54,302 --> 00:38:56,063
It's been so long since I've
seen someone with so much

376
00:38:56,169 --> 00:38:59,158
wheat.

377
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:02,201
Do you think your fields
will prove to yield as much?

378
00:39:02,302 --> 00:39:03,632
No.

379
00:39:03,736 --> 00:39:06,725
When we left there was
no one to tend them.

380
00:39:06,835 --> 00:39:09,858
They must be barren by now.

381
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:13,595
Therefore we will have to go
into another man's field

382
00:39:13,702 --> 00:39:17,032
and glean what is left.

383
00:39:27,403 --> 00:39:30,369
Naomi!

384
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,866
Can this be you?

385
00:39:32,969 --> 00:39:35,162
You have returned!

386
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:38,393
Oh, praise God.

387
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,059
Tani.

388
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:44,533
Oh, this is my daughter, Ruth.

389
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:48,829
Welcome to Israel.

390
00:39:50,935 --> 00:39:54,833
Oh, look at the two of you,
you must be famished.

391
00:39:54,935 --> 00:39:56,696
Come, I will take you to your
home.

392
00:39:56,802 --> 00:40:00,995
I'll stop and buy some food
and cook you a meal.

393
00:40:01,101 --> 00:40:03,431
I'm so happy.

394
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:51,962
I'll help you.

395
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:54,533
We'll make it beautiful.

396
00:40:55,834 --> 00:40:57,800
Oh, I have missed you.

397
00:40:57,901 --> 00:41:01,856
I prayed for years that you
would return.

398
00:41:01,968 --> 00:41:07,457
Oh, Naomi, when I heard of your
loss, I was so devastated.

399
00:41:07,567 --> 00:41:11,659
I instantly-- I called a
messenger and had him to go

400
00:41:11,768 --> 00:41:13,563
to find you.

401
00:41:13,668 --> 00:41:15,065
Oh, have some bread.

402
00:41:15,167 --> 00:41:17,962
Have some bread, Naomi, please.

403
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:22,432
I cannot imagine what you have
been going through.

404
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:25,523
I needed to find you to let
you know that you would not be

405
00:41:25,634 --> 00:41:29,225
going through this alone.

406
00:41:29,334 --> 00:41:30,322
Oh, I see it.

407
00:41:30,434 --> 00:41:31,730
I see it.

408
00:41:31,833 --> 00:41:36,027
There is a smile.

409
00:41:36,134 --> 00:41:40,328
Oh, I long to hear your laugh
again, Naomi, your beautiful

410
00:41:40,434 --> 00:41:41,525
laugh, child.

411
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:45,327
This woman has laughter that
can light up the darkest night.

412
00:41:45,434 --> 00:41:47,229
Naomi, have some more water.

413
00:41:47,334 --> 00:41:51,595
Stop!

414
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,791
Stop saying my name.

415
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,763
Stop calling me Naomi.

416
00:41:56,867 --> 00:42:01,390
It means pleasant,
and I am far from that.

417
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:05,728
I’ve lost everything.

418
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:09,197
My name should be Marah.

419
00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:13,789
The emptiness and bitterness
can only describe what I'm

420
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,559
feeling in this moment.

421
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:20,690
But you are home now,
the Lord will show His favor

422
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,425
on you.

423
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:29,699
- Well, I should be-- I should be leaving.
- I didn't mean...

424
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,958
No, no, I'm fine.

425
00:42:31,066 --> 00:42:32,293
I'm fine.

426
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,663
I'm just so happy
to have you back.

427
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,721
And you too, Ruth.

428
00:44:07,465 --> 00:44:11,124
We're home now.

429
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:16,630
Oh, please, God,
show us your mercy.

430
00:44:16,731 --> 00:44:21,221
If not for me, then for Ruth.

431
00:44:36,865 --> 00:44:38,956
Well, good morning.

432
00:44:39,065 --> 00:44:40,963
You’ve changed.

433
00:44:41,065 --> 00:44:43,826
My dress was torn.

434
00:44:45,164 --> 00:44:47,892
It's time.

435
00:44:47,998 --> 00:44:50,793
Today I will go to the fields
to glean.

436
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:52,830
No, Ruth.

437
00:44:52,931 --> 00:44:55,226
I thought that's what you
called it.

438
00:44:55,331 --> 00:44:56,388
It is.

439
00:44:56,498 --> 00:44:59,055
I meant that it's my job.

440
00:44:59,164 --> 00:45:00,858
You cannot do that for me.

441
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:05,827
No, you stay here
and make your home.

442
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:09,192
Let me do this for you.

443
00:45:09,297 --> 00:45:11,058
Very well

444
00:45:11,164 --> 00:45:14,653
But please, be careful.

445
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:11,057
First day?

446
00:46:11,163 --> 00:46:12,493
Yes.

447
00:46:12,597 --> 00:46:13,994
It's quite easy.

448
00:46:14,096 --> 00:46:17,756
Just watch me, you’ll learn
quickly.

449
00:46:17,863 --> 00:46:20,659
I am Ruth, daughter
of Naomi.

450
00:46:20,764 --> 00:46:25,059
I am Simeon,
picker of the wheat.

451
00:47:09,963 --> 00:47:12,360
men, look at all this wheat.

452
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,553
God has really been good to us.

453
00:47:14,663 --> 00:47:16,720
Yes, He has.

454
00:47:16,829 --> 00:47:19,488
Just finished surveying the
fields here and we think we're

455
00:47:19,596 --> 00:47:23,494
gonna finish with more crops
and ahead of schedule.

456
00:47:23,596 --> 00:47:26,824
That is glorious news.

457
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:31,088
So, what would you
have us do next?

458
00:47:35,596 --> 00:47:36,959
Sir?

459
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:39,528
What would you have us do next?

460
00:47:39,629 --> 00:47:40,787
What?

461
00:47:40,895 --> 00:47:42,724
We're ahead of schedule.

462
00:47:42,828 --> 00:47:44,385
That's good.

463
00:47:44,496 --> 00:47:46,587
You all right, sir?

464
00:47:46,695 --> 00:47:53,185
Seth, who's that woman
over there?

465
00:47:53,295 --> 00:47:54,851
I-- I have no idea.

466
00:47:54,962 --> 00:47:57,360
I don’t have time to take
the name of everyone,

467
00:47:57,461 --> 00:48:01,019
especially the gleaners.

468
00:48:04,928 --> 00:48:06,518
What is wrong with him?

469
00:48:06,628 --> 00:48:09,526
How should I know?

470
00:48:10,428 --> 00:48:13,122
Benjamin, do you know
the name of this woman?

471
00:48:13,229 --> 00:48:14,319
No, sir.

472
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:17,156
Seth had me tending the grain
all day and my hands were kind

473
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:19,693
of full.

474
00:48:19,795 --> 00:48:22,158
Sir, why are you so
concerned with this woman,

475
00:48:22,261 --> 00:48:24,023
and a foreigner at that?

476
00:48:24,128 --> 00:48:29,254
Do any of my workers know
the name of this woman?

477
00:48:29,361 --> 00:48:32,657
May I speak, sir?

478
00:48:32,762 --> 00:48:34,751
Yes, my friend.

479
00:48:34,862 --> 00:48:37,327
Her name is Ruth.

480
00:48:37,428 --> 00:48:39,257
Ruth.

481
00:48:39,361 --> 00:48:40,883
She's the daughter of Naomi.

482
00:48:40,994 --> 00:48:48,052
She's been working with me
all day and has not stopped.

483
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:49,627
If my services are through
here, sir, I'd like to return

484
00:48:49,728 --> 00:48:52,216
to my work.

485
00:48:52,328 --> 00:48:54,419
Of course.

486
00:48:57,927 --> 00:49:04,053
Sir, you need to focus
on the grain.

487
00:49:04,161 --> 00:49:08,321
I am tired of you
questioning my decisions.

488
00:49:08,428 --> 00:49:09,984
You're relieved of your duties.

489
00:49:10,094 --> 00:49:10,718
But, sir.

490
00:49:10,827 --> 00:49:13,452
Leave now.

491
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:17,288
I'll report this to Neb.

492
00:49:17,394 --> 00:49:21,622
Tell my uncle whatever
you wish.

493
00:49:21,727 --> 00:49:26,352
You, sir, what's your name?

494
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,255
They call me Simeon.

495
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,793
Well, Simeon,
congratulations.

496
00:49:31,894 --> 00:49:35,122
You’ve become my new chief
harvester.

497
00:49:35,227 --> 00:49:39,990
Seems like you know more about
my fields than my workers do.

498
00:49:40,093 --> 00:49:42,218
Blessings to you.

499
00:49:42,327 --> 00:49:44,885
Blessings to you.

500
00:49:44,993 --> 00:49:48,187
To you as well.

501
00:50:00,227 --> 00:50:04,852
Is it true that you're
the daughter of Naomi?

502
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,153
Yes, sir.

503
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:07,453
You don’t have to call me
sir.

504
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,150
I'm not your master.

505
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,192
My name is Boaz.

506
00:50:11,293 --> 00:50:15,987
Yes, sir, I mean Boaz.

507
00:50:16,093 --> 00:50:19,059
I don’t want you to work
anyone's fields but mine.

508
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:23,115
You have the freedom to do
whatever you need to do.

509
00:50:23,227 --> 00:50:25,090
Thank you.

510
00:50:25,193 --> 00:50:28,091
You must know that I'm not
of your people.

511
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:30,159
Why are you so good to me?

512
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:36,056
I don't see people
for who they’re not.

513
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:41,820
I see them for who they are.

514
00:50:41,926 --> 00:50:45,221
I know you've come here seeking
protection under the wings

515
00:50:45,326 --> 00:50:48,554
of our Lord.

516
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:53,319
I pray that He uses me
for that purpose.

517
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:56,324
Thank you.

518
00:51:15,693 --> 00:51:22,023
Sir, I wanted to apologize
about today.

519
00:51:22,126 --> 00:51:26,388
Go eat, enjoy yourself.

520
00:51:26,493 --> 00:51:31,425
But why did you not release
me?

521
00:51:31,526 --> 00:51:36,185
Cause you're a good learner
and unlike others, you never

522
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:41,054
make the same mistake twice.

523
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:44,591
She's still there.

524
00:51:44,692 --> 00:51:51,716
Benjamin, tomorrow when we eat,
I want you to go tell Ruth.

525
00:51:51,825 --> 00:51:55,313
I want her to eat with us.

526
00:51:55,425 --> 00:51:58,414
Yes, sir.

527
00:52:06,792 --> 00:52:07,780
Take a drink.

528
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:08,880
You look thirsty.

529
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:10,617
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

530
00:52:10,725 --> 00:52:11,588
Sir?

531
00:52:11,692 --> 00:52:12,282
Yes.

532
00:52:12,392 --> 00:52:13,881
I have just been released.

533
00:52:13,991 --> 00:52:14,685
Why?

534
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:18,053
Because Boaz is distracted
by some foreigner.

535
00:52:18,158 --> 00:52:19,590
Who is this foreigner?

536
00:52:19,692 --> 00:52:20,521
I have no idea.

537
00:52:20,625 --> 00:52:22,215
Some woman from Moab.

538
00:52:22,325 --> 00:52:24,723
Who's related to someone named
Naomi.

539
00:52:24,824 --> 00:52:26,290
Naomi is back?

540
00:52:26,392 --> 00:52:29,915
What would you like me
to do?

541
00:52:30,025 --> 00:52:32,923
I will take care of it.

542
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:36,116
You are true to your people.

543
00:52:43,991 --> 00:52:48,185
Ruth, have you eaten yet?

544
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:51,280
No, sir, I'd rather wait
till I finish the work.

545
00:52:51,392 --> 00:52:53,255
You can finish later.

546
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:56,290
Eat, eat with us now.

547
00:52:56,391 --> 00:52:58,584
No, no, no, come sit over here.

548
00:52:58,691 --> 00:53:02,350
Sit with me.

549
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:11,856
Pomegranate.

550
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:31,613
I should be getting back
to work.

551
00:53:31,724 --> 00:53:36,747
It's getting late and I have
not gathered nearly enough.

552
00:53:36,857 --> 00:53:38,483
Okay, well, wait.

553
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:40,750
Before you go,
before you go,

554
00:53:40,857 --> 00:53:43,755
I want you to take this.

555
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:53,186
I want you to give this
to Naomi.

556
00:53:53,290 --> 00:54:01,746
You tell her that this is
a gift from Boaz.

557
00:54:01,857 --> 00:54:04,823
Thank you again.

558
00:54:11,057 --> 00:54:13,648
Benjamin, how much has she
gleaned?

559
00:54:13,757 --> 00:54:18,416
Not much, maybe enough
for two people for a few days.

560
00:54:18,523 --> 00:54:21,580
I want you to take a few
bushels and shake it out

561
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:25,145
and put some grain out
so she can collect it.

562
00:54:25,256 --> 00:54:28,087
If you don’t mind me asking,
why do you give her more when

563
00:54:28,189 --> 00:54:34,952
she doesn't ask for any?

564
00:54:35,056 --> 00:54:39,250
I'm just following her
example.

565
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:56,486
Ruth, how was your day?

566
00:54:56,590 --> 00:55:01,147
We were blessed.

567
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,881
Who was kind enough to let
you glean all this grain

568
00:55:02,989 --> 00:55:06,183
from their field?

569
00:55:06,289 --> 00:55:08,686
His name was Boaz.

570
00:55:08,789 --> 00:55:11,721
Boaz?

571
00:55:11,822 --> 00:55:13,981
Boaz.

572
00:55:14,089 --> 00:55:17,283
He is a relative
of Elimelech's.

573
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:19,185
He was always such
a kind child.

574
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:20,754
He's still very kind.

575
00:55:20,856 --> 00:55:25,255
Look what he gave me
and even more.

576
00:55:31,355 --> 00:55:34,117
Come, help me sort
the grain.

577
00:55:40,123 --> 00:55:43,714
with their needs now being
met, Ruth began to feel

578
00:55:43,822 --> 00:55:48,845
the pains of being alone,
the reality of a stranger

579
00:55:48,956 --> 00:55:50,819
in a strange land.

580
00:55:50,922 --> 00:55:53,978
Now it feels like home.

581
00:55:54,088 --> 00:55:57,521
Yes, it does.

582
00:56:03,022 --> 00:56:04,954
Ruth?

583
00:56:05,055 --> 00:56:09,987
How is your heart,
about Mahlon, I mean?

584
00:56:10,088 --> 00:56:12,646
Some days I'm busy
and I forget.

585
00:56:12,755 --> 00:56:16,744
Some days he's all
I ever think about.

586
00:56:16,855 --> 00:56:18,878
God has someone out there
for you.

587
00:56:18,988 --> 00:56:22,512
He does not mean for you
to be aloe.

588
00:56:22,621 --> 00:56:23,882
But I'm a foreigner.

589
00:56:23,988 --> 00:56:27,045
No man in Bethlehem
would want to marry me.

590
00:56:27,155 --> 00:56:30,848
Any man with half his wits
would die to be with you.

591
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:33,387
I don’t believe I can
provide him with a family.

592
00:56:33,488 --> 00:56:35,545
You're too young
to say that.

593
00:56:35,655 --> 00:56:37,121
What about you?

594
00:56:37,222 --> 00:56:40,154
I can't get married
and leave you behind.

595
00:56:40,255 --> 00:56:41,720
It's too soon.

596
00:56:41,821 --> 00:56:43,117
Now you say it's too soon.

597
00:56:43,222 --> 00:56:45,278
One day you’ll say
it's too late.

598
00:56:45,388 --> 00:56:48,684
Maybe God can find a way
to bless us together.

599
00:56:48,788 --> 00:56:53,379
Anything is possible
where God is concerned.

600
00:56:54,121 --> 00:56:55,109
This area over here.

601
00:56:55,221 --> 00:56:57,710
We gotta make sure that there's
fencing put around the entire

602
00:56:57,821 --> 00:57:01,810
area because these
have you gone mad?

603
00:57:01,921 --> 00:57:03,250
What?

604
00:57:03,354 --> 00:57:07,810
I hear you are giving extra
food to that foreigner.

605
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,512
You know if you do that, you
must give it to all the others

606
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:13,143
and you’ll probably do it.

607
00:57:13,254 --> 00:57:15,947
She never takes anymore than
what is allotted by the law

608
00:57:16,054 --> 00:57:17,849
- and even then she won't take--
- Don't waste your breath

609
00:57:17,954 --> 00:57:18,942
on him.

610
00:57:19,054 --> 00:57:21,452
This is not about the law.

611
00:57:21,554 --> 00:57:23,849
This is about treating
a foreigner better

612
00:57:23,954 --> 00:57:27,614
than your own people.

613
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,914
You tell Simeon to put
together a bundle and to give

614
00:57:31,021 --> 00:57:31,884
it to Naomi.

615
00:57:31,987 --> 00:57:34,476
Tell her it is a gift from me.

616
00:57:34,587 --> 00:57:36,019
They’ll have their food.

617
00:57:36,121 --> 00:57:39,951
She is bringing a curse
upon us, the curse of death.

618
00:57:40,054 --> 00:57:43,577
The same curse that she did
to her family.

619
00:57:44,854 --> 00:57:48,513
Sir.

620
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:51,848
Just because we're
relatives, I do not have to

621
00:57:51,954 --> 00:57:54,216
tolerate this kind of behavior.

622
00:57:54,320 --> 00:58:00,117
One day you will need me,
and I will not be there.

623
00:58:02,021 --> 00:58:03,509
Pay him no mind.

624
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:05,711
He knows nothing about
anything.

625
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,809
He's a fool.

626
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,545
Don't ever allow yourself
to be called a fool.

627
00:58:12,654 --> 00:58:15,745
I understand what you're trying
to do, sir, just I beg you

628
00:58:15,854 --> 00:58:18,251
be careful.

629
00:58:18,353 --> 00:58:21,183
You worried about me?

630
00:58:21,286 --> 00:58:23,548
Well, if I can speak freely,
many of us are very concerned

631
00:58:23,654 --> 00:58:27,177
why you're going out of your
way for this woman?

632
00:58:27,286 --> 00:58:29,979
Why is that so hard
to understand?

633
00:58:30,086 --> 00:58:33,211
Love, sir, see, love has
never been part of your life.

634
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,945
It's always been just work.

635
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,576
The only thing that comes
before it is God and the only

636
00:58:36,687 --> 00:58:39,914
thing after it
has been sleep so...

637
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:43,884
Look, who said anything
about love?

638
00:58:43,986 --> 00:58:48,419
I'm just wanting to find
the right one

639
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,951
Well, a lot of good women
have come and gone as you wait

640
00:58:51,053 --> 00:58:56,008
for the right one.

641
00:58:56,120 --> 00:59:01,314
Why settle for that which is
good when you can have what's

642
00:59:01,419 --> 00:59:03,908
great.

643
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,849
Okay, I'll remember that.

644
00:59:05,953 --> 00:59:08,316
I just pray that my good
friend, Boaz, has the wisdom to

645
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:14,114
know good from great when she's
standing right in front of him.

646
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:21,309
Nao-- excuse me, Marah.

647
00:59:21,419 --> 00:59:25,749
It's so good to see life
come back into this place.

648
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:28,011
It is because of Ruth.

649
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:30,517
Oh.

650
00:59:30,619 --> 00:59:33,244
She is so good to you.

651
00:59:33,352 --> 00:59:37,444
All the mothers in the village
are jealous.

652
00:59:40,386 --> 00:59:42,943
So in all these years
you’ve never married.

653
00:59:43,052 --> 00:59:46,485
No, but I'm at peace
with that.

654
00:59:46,586 --> 00:59:56,076
I let that idea drift away
a very, very long time ago.

655
00:59:56,185 --> 00:59:58,276
Ah, you’ve done it again.

656
00:59:58,386 --> 00:59:59,374
What?

657
00:59:59,486 --> 01:00:03,509
Well, I came here to comfort
you and now you are thinking

658
01:00:03,618 --> 01:00:05,482
of me.

659
01:00:05,585 --> 01:00:06,608
You are my friend.

660
01:00:06,718 --> 01:00:10,412
It's the least I can do.

661
01:00:10,518 --> 01:00:13,280
I know.

662
01:00:13,385 --> 01:00:18,477
I’ve seen how you and Ruth
struggle from day to day.

663
01:00:18,585 --> 01:00:20,483
Why don't you sell this place?

664
01:00:20,585 --> 01:00:21,983
Go on.

665
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:26,142
You can get a very good price
for it right now.

666
01:00:26,251 --> 01:00:29,649
Mmm, I've thought about it,
but I feel that God is

667
01:00:29,752 --> 01:00:31,945
telling me to wait.

668
01:00:32,052 --> 01:00:35,643
I know but you can sell it
to

669
01:00:35,752 --> 01:00:36,410
Naomi.

670
01:00:36,518 --> 01:00:37,211
Yes.

671
01:00:37,318 --> 01:00:38,978
Oh, you're home.

672
01:00:39,084 --> 01:00:40,675
Peace be with you.

673
01:00:40,785 --> 01:00:41,944
I'm Simeon.

674
01:00:42,051 --> 01:00:45,711
My master, Boaz, has sent
a gift for you and Ruth.

675
01:00:45,818 --> 01:00:49,215
Oh, Boaz is too kind.

676
01:00:49,318 --> 01:00:49,976
Come, eat with us.

677
01:00:50,084 --> 01:00:53,608
There's more than enough
for two.

678
01:00:53,718 --> 01:00:55,513
Won't you stay?

679
01:00:55,618 --> 01:01:01,209
I-- I must be moving on.

680
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:03,614
Well, may the Lord bless
you.

681
01:01:03,717 --> 01:01:07,548
And you.

682
01:01:12,451 --> 01:01:15,440
It's good to see Simeon
doing so well.

683
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:16,846
You know him?

684
01:01:16,951 --> 01:01:21,407
Yes, yes, he's a kind man
who fell on some hard times,

685
01:01:21,517 --> 01:01:24,109
but I hear the Lord has blessed
him.

686
01:01:24,218 --> 01:01:26,877
Ah.

687
01:01:26,984 --> 01:01:28,609
Oh, I'm out of water.

688
01:01:28,717 --> 01:01:29,910
Let's go to the well.

689
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:31,211
The walk will do us both good.

690
01:01:31,317 --> 01:01:31,951
Oh.

691
01:01:31,951 --> 01:01:33,212
Oh.

692
01:01:36,018 --> 01:01:37,415
Greetings again, ladies.

693
01:01:37,517 --> 01:01:39,312
Let me get that, Naomi.

694
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:42,872
Thank you, Simeon.

695
01:01:45,984 --> 01:01:48,381
You know the harvest
festival is tomorrow.

696
01:01:48,484 --> 01:01:49,711
Yes, I know.

697
01:01:49,817 --> 01:01:52,908
This is the first time I've
ever been cause now I'm

698
01:01:53,017 --> 01:01:54,483
a harvester.

699
01:01:54,584 --> 01:01:57,379
Well, I'm very pleased
for your promotion.

700
01:01:57,484 --> 01:02:01,280
Thank you.

701
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:05,316
Tani would love to go
to the festival with you.

702
01:02:05,417 --> 01:02:07,178
I would like that.

703
01:02:07,283 --> 01:02:10,044
I would like that very much.

704
01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:14,775
Well see you at the house.

705
01:02:19,716 --> 01:02:24,274
I thank you a thousand times
for what you just did, I think.

706
01:02:24,384 --> 01:02:28,339
I never thought that a man like
that would be interested in me.

707
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:34,349
God works miracles when you
least expect them.

708
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:43,315
Yes, He does, doesn’t He?

709
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,908
How is it I've been working
all day and you seem to be

710
01:03:09,016 --> 01:03:11,039
the one out of breath?

711
01:03:11,149 --> 01:03:12,410
What have you been up to?

712
01:03:12,516 --> 01:03:18,210
Come, sit down,
we must talk.

713
01:03:18,316 --> 01:03:22,839
God has put something
into my heart.

714
01:03:22,949 --> 01:03:25,813
The time is now.

715
01:03:25,915 --> 01:03:27,541
The time is now?

716
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:31,672
Oh, mother, please tell me
you're not dying.

717
01:03:31,782 --> 01:03:35,306
No, I have not felt
this good in years.

718
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:38,109
That's good.

719
01:03:38,216 --> 01:03:44,012
It is time for you
to move on.

720
01:03:44,116 --> 01:03:47,378
Oh, mother,
I cannot leave you.

721
01:03:47,482 --> 01:03:52,710
Listen, the harvest festival
is tonight, you must go.

722
01:03:52,815 --> 01:03:55,338
You know
I'm not allowed there.

723
01:03:55,448 --> 01:03:57,108
You're not just a gleaner.

724
01:03:57,216 --> 01:04:02,580
Through me you're a kin
which brings me to this,

725
01:04:02,682 --> 01:04:08,342
I believe God has shown me
who you are to marry.

726
01:04:08,448 --> 01:04:09,778
I am from Moab.

727
01:04:09,882 --> 01:04:12,609
No one even looks at me.

728
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:18,909
Oh, daughter, there is one
who looks at you every day.

729
01:04:19,015 --> 01:04:20,447
Who?

730
01:04:20,548 --> 01:04:24,378
Boaz.

731
01:04:26,981 --> 01:04:30,345
Boaz.

732
01:04:38,348 --> 01:04:40,905
Well, yes.

733
01:04:41,015 --> 01:04:46,471
He's a very kind man,
but I'm not worthy of his love

734
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:51,207
and he could not be possibly
interested in me.

735
01:04:51,315 --> 01:04:54,509
Oh, Ruth.

736
01:04:54,614 --> 01:04:57,274
Boaz has been waiting for
someone like you just as you

737
01:04:57,382 --> 01:05:00,280
have been waiting
for someone like him.

738
01:05:00,382 --> 01:05:04,314
He can protect you
and provide for you.

739
01:05:04,414 --> 01:05:07,108
You must let him know your true
feelings tonight.

740
01:05:07,215 --> 01:05:10,306
But tonight is the harvest
festival and hell be busy

741
01:05:10,414 --> 01:05:11,778
with the celebration.

742
01:05:11,881 --> 01:05:15,643
I assure you that when he
sees you, he will stop

743
01:05:15,748 --> 01:05:17,771
and take notice.

744
01:05:17,881 --> 01:05:23,575
Look at me, I've been wearing
the same clothes since we arrived.

745
01:05:23,681 --> 01:05:27,738
All hell notice is
how bad I look.

746
01:05:27,848 --> 01:05:32,303
Come, let me show you
something.

747
01:05:44,913 --> 01:05:51,278
Mother, this is beautiful.
You did not have to do this.

748
01:05:51,381 --> 01:05:53,540
Oh, yes I did, Ruth.

749
01:05:53,648 --> 01:05:56,170
You have been so kind
and loyal to me even

750
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,508
when you did not have to be.

751
01:05:58,614 --> 01:06:01,512
You deserve something that
reflects the beauty that I see

752
01:06:01,613 --> 01:06:03,875
in you.

753
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:07,537
It's the most beautiful
dress I've ever seen.

754
01:06:07,647 --> 01:06:09,579
Perhaps you're right.

755
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,737
Maybe Boaz will notice me.

756
01:06:12,847 --> 01:06:17,836
But there is more and you
will have to trust me.

757
01:06:17,947 --> 01:06:20,175
All right.

758
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,871
Tonight when you go
to the festival, wait.

759
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,174
You will surely want to run up
to him but do not.

760
01:06:27,279 --> 01:06:31,769
Just watch and wait until he's
had plenty to eat and drink and

761
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:34,505
then follow him where he goes
to rest.

762
01:06:34,613 --> 01:06:37,511
Wait until he falls asleep,

763
01:06:37,613 --> 01:06:41,477
uncover his feet
and lie down there.

764
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:46,512
Mother, I trust you,
but I cannot do that.

765
01:06:46,613 --> 01:06:49,875
Oh, Ruth, it is a custom
of our people.

766
01:06:49,979 --> 01:06:53,673
Boaz will recognize the sign
you are making and he will show

767
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:56,268
you whether he agrees or not.

768
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,608
What if he's not
an honorable man?

769
01:06:58,713 --> 01:07:01,008
What if tries to take advantage
of me?

770
01:07:01,113 --> 01:07:04,671
If Boaz is the man of God
I know him to be, he will only

771
01:07:04,779 --> 01:07:07,245
do what the law tells him to do.

772
01:07:07,346 --> 01:07:09,073
This plan seems so foolish.

773
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:10,167
Trust me.

774
01:07:10,279 --> 01:07:13,074
God uses the foolish things
of this world to confound

775
01:07:13,179 --> 01:07:14,667
the wise.

776
01:07:14,779 --> 01:07:19,178
He will not let you be harmed.

777
01:07:19,279 --> 01:07:21,744
All right.

778
01:07:21,846 --> 01:07:23,176
I'll do it.

779
01:07:23,279 --> 01:07:23,903
Good.

780
01:07:24,013 --> 01:07:24,979
We have little time.

781
01:07:25,079 --> 01:07:27,977
We must get you ready to go.

782
01:07:54,646 --> 01:07:57,669
That will be my last drink.

783
01:07:57,779 --> 01:08:01,438
Oh, come on,
you deserve one more.

784
01:08:01,545 --> 01:08:02,602
What about you?

785
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:06,610
You having a good time?

786
01:08:07,978 --> 01:08:12,308
Oh, oh, someone has caught
your eye.

787
01:08:12,412 --> 01:08:14,809
Seth used to always say that
women only want you if you have

788
01:08:14,911 --> 01:08:16,138
something to give.

789
01:08:16,245 --> 01:08:16,972
Seth?

790
01:08:17,078 --> 01:08:18,941
A lot of good that has done
him.

791
01:08:19,045 --> 01:08:20,375
Very true.

792
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:25,843
Look, you're a fine man,
strong, courageous.

793
01:08:25,945 --> 01:08:28,809
You're more than any of these
women would want.

794
01:08:28,911 --> 01:08:29,672
You think so?

795
01:08:29,778 --> 01:08:34,370
Yes, you just gotta have
more confidence in yourself.

796
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:36,308
And what have you got to lose?

797
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:41,344
If she says no, you're no worse
off than you are now.

798
01:08:41,444 --> 01:08:42,103
All right.

799
01:08:42,212 --> 01:08:42,973
Yes, you're right.

800
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:44,976
You're right.

801
01:11:27,709 --> 01:11:30,140
Who's there?

802
01:11:30,242 --> 01:11:33,504
It is I, Ruth.

803
01:11:33,609 --> 01:11:36,837
Ruth?

804
01:11:36,943 --> 01:11:43,068
What are you doing here?

805
01:11:43,175 --> 01:11:48,608
Because you are kinsman,
I approach you this night.

806
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:52,232
You once asked may the Lord
protect me under the spread

807
01:11:52,342 --> 01:12:01,674
of his wings, now I ask
the same of you.

808
01:12:15,642 --> 01:12:21,666
Thank God.

809
01:12:21,775 --> 01:12:27,037
Did Naomi put you up to this?

810
01:12:29,142 --> 01:12:34,802
You are a faithful woman.

811
01:12:34,908 --> 01:12:36,771
Why me?

812
01:12:36,875 --> 01:12:41,705
Of all the men you could have
chosen, why me?

813
01:12:41,808 --> 01:12:46,263
Because your kindness is
greater than I've ever known.

814
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:51,000
You’ve shown me mercy
when I've not deserved it.

815
01:12:51,108 --> 01:12:54,768
I will not choose another.

816
01:12:54,875 --> 01:13:00,739
You're the only one
that can save our family.

817
01:13:02,808 --> 01:13:06,967
When I first saw you
in the field,

818
01:13:07,074 --> 01:13:09,972
I knew you were special.

819
01:13:12,675 --> 01:13:18,073
I prayed and asked God that if
it be His will that you would

820
01:13:18,174 --> 01:13:24,232
give me your love.

821
01:13:24,341 --> 01:13:29,239
Then the Lord made it so.

822
01:13:36,308 --> 01:13:40,967
I am not your closest
kinsman.

823
01:13:41,074 --> 01:13:49,370
There's another, one who I have
created a problem with.

824
01:13:49,474 --> 01:13:53,406
He would do anything he could
to spite me especially if it

825
01:13:53,507 --> 01:13:56,667
has anything to do with you.

826
01:13:56,774 --> 01:13:59,467
Who is this man that could
hate you?

827
01:13:59,574 --> 01:14:05,803
Neb, the brother
of Elimelech.

828
01:14:05,907 --> 01:14:12,863
But this-- this is something that
I-- I have-- I've brought upon

829
01:14:12,973 --> 01:14:16,996
myself and I-- I can fix this.

830
01:14:17,107 --> 01:14:21,130
It's my problem to solve
and I will.

831
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,967
You just have to trust me.

832
01:14:23,073 --> 01:14:27,971
I'll make it right.

833
01:14:28,073 --> 01:14:31,903
You just need to sleep.

834
01:14:32,007 --> 01:14:34,235
You can sleep here.

835
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:39,238
Here, you can sleep here.

836
01:14:41,973 --> 01:14:45,871
I'll take care of everything.

837
01:15:07,139 --> 01:15:09,765
Ruth... Ruth, Ruth, Ruth.

838
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:16,294
Ruth, wake up, wake up.

839
01:15:16,406 --> 01:15:18,429
You have to leave
before the sun comes up.

840
01:15:18,539 --> 01:15:23,631
People will think
the wrong thing.

841
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:26,171
Since I've met you,
you’ve always thought of me

842
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,738
over yourself.

843
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:34,671
Well, I think a woman ought
to be treated with kindness

844
01:15:34,772 --> 01:15:41,069
no matter where she's from,
who she is.

845
01:15:48,839 --> 01:15:52,601
I really want to be with you,
but I have to do it according

846
01:15:52,705 --> 01:15:54,001
to the law.

847
01:15:54,106 --> 01:15:57,936
I can't touch you
until the law says I can.

848
01:15:58,039 --> 01:15:59,369
I'm gonna work this out.

849
01:15:59,472 --> 01:16:01,268
Trust me.

850
01:16:01,373 --> 01:16:08,567
I need you to go and be
with your mother.

851
01:16:08,672 --> 01:16:11,604
Okay?

852
01:16:11,705 --> 01:16:14,035
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

853
01:16:14,139 --> 01:16:17,571
I want you to take this.

854
01:16:22,205 --> 01:16:26,103
Give this to Naomi.

855
01:16:30,705 --> 01:16:34,501
Tell her I said thank you.

856
01:16:34,605 --> 01:16:37,503
She'll understand.

857
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:53,631
And the next day Boaz sat,
not eating or drinking

858
01:16:53,738 --> 01:16:56,966
until God showed him
how to be together

859
01:16:57,071 --> 01:17:00,265
with his one true love.

860
01:17:15,904 --> 01:17:18,802
Well?

861
01:17:20,738 --> 01:17:22,034
Oh!

862
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:25,002
Oh, mother,
you should have seen it.

863
01:17:25,105 --> 01:17:28,037
He awoke and said,
'Who is there?'

864
01:17:28,138 --> 01:17:29,967
I said, it is I, Ruth.

865
01:17:30,071 --> 01:17:38,902
And he-- and he-- oh, mother
he's an honorable man.

866
01:17:39,005 --> 01:17:40,937
You were right.

867
01:17:41,037 --> 01:17:45,936
Thank you for showing me
the way.

868
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:48,367
There is a problem though.

869
01:17:48,471 --> 01:17:51,925
There's a kinsman closer
than Boaz.

870
01:17:52,037 --> 01:17:53,298
It is Neb.

871
01:17:53,404 --> 01:17:54,665
You knew?

872
01:17:54,771 --> 01:17:58,066
Yes.

873
01:17:58,170 --> 01:18:00,659
I could have made my life
easier by selling the field

874
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:04,362
and bringing Neb closer to me,
but I did not want you

875
01:18:04,471 --> 01:18:10,199
in his mercy and I knew Boaz
would fight for you.

876
01:18:10,304 --> 01:18:13,065
He said he would do
the right thing, for us to sit

877
01:18:13,170 --> 01:18:14,397
and wait.

878
01:18:14,504 --> 01:18:18,731
Boaz will do his part,
but we must do our part too.

879
01:18:18,837 --> 01:18:21,598
What else is there for us
to do?

880
01:18:21,703 --> 01:18:24,431
Pray.

881
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:33,900
Oh, Lord, I thank You
with all my heart.

882
01:18:34,004 --> 01:18:38,902
I thank You for Your mercy,
for Your grace,

883
01:18:39,004 --> 01:18:42,401
for a second chance.

884
01:18:44,603 --> 01:18:46,569
I want you to betray me.

885
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:50,000
What?

886
01:18:50,103 --> 01:18:51,694
I want you to go to Neb.

887
01:18:51,803 --> 01:18:57,394
Tell him that I've just-- I've
lost my wits in my infatuation

888
01:18:57,503 --> 01:19:01,265
for Ruth and I'm about to give
her half of my grain.

889
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:03,427
But, sir,
this could ruin you.

890
01:19:03,536 --> 01:19:05,502
I mean they could publicly
ridicule you for showing

891
01:19:05,603 --> 01:19:08,763
favoritism.

892
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:13,734
I know.

893
01:19:13,836 --> 01:19:16,564
It's love.

894
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:23,830
For that, I would risk
anything.

895
01:19:27,436 --> 01:19:30,560
All right.

896
01:19:30,669 --> 01:19:34,567
If you believe that, so do I.

897
01:19:40,136 --> 01:19:43,159
Neb, you were right.

898
01:19:43,269 --> 01:19:46,826
Boaz has lost his wits
over that Moab woman.

899
01:19:46,936 --> 01:19:50,198
I mean, he has chosen to give
half his grain to Ruth.

900
01:19:50,302 --> 01:19:51,030
I knew it.

901
01:19:51,136 --> 01:19:55,329
The son of Rahab is showing
his true self.

902
01:19:55,435 --> 01:19:58,230
Will you testify to this?

903
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:00,528
Yes, I will.

904
01:20:00,636 --> 01:20:01,897
You're a wise man, Benjamin.

905
01:20:02,003 --> 01:20:04,026
I will see you rewarded.

906
01:20:04,135 --> 01:20:05,192
Thank you, sir.

907
01:20:05,302 --> 01:20:08,268
Now we need to get the elders
to the public square

908
01:20:08,369 --> 01:20:12,267
so that may see the true Boaz.

909
01:20:27,702 --> 01:20:29,292
Is this true?

910
01:20:29,402 --> 01:20:32,095
This man will testify
to this.

911
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:34,724
You will swear to this?

912
01:20:34,835 --> 01:20:37,733
I give you my solemn oath.

913
01:20:37,835 --> 01:20:40,960
Neb, you’ve doe a great
service for your people.

914
01:20:41,068 --> 01:20:44,830
I will gather the elders
to meet us here at the temple.

915
01:20:58,568 --> 01:21:00,194
Boaz, you are here.

916
01:21:00,301 --> 01:21:05,359
We have some concerns about
your actions with the harvest.

917
01:21:14,668 --> 01:21:15,998
I have nothing to hide.

918
01:21:16,101 --> 01:21:19,465
You will not make light
of this once you find out what

919
01:21:19,568 --> 01:21:23,933
I know about your intentions.

920
01:21:24,034 --> 01:21:28,091
Members of council,
people of Israel,

921
01:21:28,201 --> 01:21:31,099
this man is a traitor.

922
01:21:31,201 --> 01:21:35,691
He plans to give half his grain
to that woman from Moab.

923
01:21:35,801 --> 01:21:38,164
He is no longer one of us.

924
01:21:38,267 --> 01:21:41,790
If I were to do something like
that, give away anything to

925
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:51,095
a foreigner, I would expect
to be stoned to death.

926
01:21:51,201 --> 01:21:53,326
Is this true, Boaz?

927
01:21:53,434 --> 01:21:59,162
Are you planning to do
what he says?

928
01:21:59,267 --> 01:22:00,755
Neb is right.

929
01:22:00,867 --> 01:22:06,164
I do plan on helping the widow,
but by purchasing the land

930
01:22:06,267 --> 01:22:13,257
owned by Elimelech and by
becoming her kinsman to save

931
01:22:13,367 --> 01:22:15,890
the house of Elimelech
from destitution.

932
01:22:16,001 --> 01:22:18,967
You will not do that,
that is my right.

933
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:20,930
I am the closest relative.

934
01:22:21,034 --> 01:22:26,489
Elimelech's land and his wife
are mine.

935
01:22:26,600 --> 01:22:29,430
Neb, you did not read
the law carefully.

936
01:22:29,533 --> 01:22:32,829
It is not the widow of Elimelech
that you redeem but the wife

937
01:22:32,934 --> 01:22:36,388
of his son, the Moabitess
named Ruth.

938
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,056
No, no, no, no, no, no.

939
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:39,462
It is not so.

940
01:22:39,567 --> 01:22:43,465
It is not so.

941
01:22:43,567 --> 01:22:48,897
Neb, do you still intend
to redeem the land and Ruth?

942
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,898
I will not marry a woman
from Moab.

943
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,125
He will deal with her.

944
01:22:54,233 --> 01:22:56,665
As is a custom of our laws,
remove your sandal and give it

945
01:22:56,766 --> 01:23:01,358
to Boaz.

946
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,727
By the power of the council
given by God, I name Boaz

947
01:23:07,833 --> 01:23:10,391
the kinsman redeemer
of the house of Elimelech.

948
01:23:15,466 --> 01:23:17,796
but if you did not plan
to give her half your grain,

949
01:23:17,899 --> 01:23:20,456
then that man is a liar.

950
01:23:20,566 --> 01:23:23,294
No, he did not lie.

951
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:25,922
I do plan on giving
half my bounty to Ruth.

952
01:23:26,033 --> 01:23:26,930
You see?

953
01:23:27,033 --> 01:23:32,522
But not the half
that belongs to Israel.

954
01:23:32,633 --> 01:23:38,293
I want to give her my half,
for I plan to make her my wife.

955
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:47,722
Ruth and Boaz were married
shortly after and a new hope

956
01:23:47,833 --> 01:23:51,432
began for Ruth and Naomi, which
surely was a blessing from God.

957
01:23:51,432 --> 01:23:56,091
began for Ruth and Naomi, which
surely was a blessing from God.

958
01:23:56,199 --> 01:23:59,290
Their trust and faith in Him
allowed blessings on their

959
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:04,297
family they never thought
possible.

960
01:24:15,566 --> 01:24:19,362
I came as soon as I heard.

961
01:24:19,466 --> 01:24:22,193
There's something really wrong
with Ruth.

962
01:24:22,299 --> 01:24:25,731
She can't keep anything down
that she eats.

963
01:24:25,832 --> 01:24:30,855
Boaz, I need for you
to go outside.

964
01:24:32,199 --> 01:24:33,391
And get what?

965
01:24:33,498 --> 01:24:37,931
Nothing, go pray.

966
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:39,429
Pray?

967
01:24:39,531 --> 01:24:42,622
Pray.

968
01:24:49,498 --> 01:24:53,191
She wants me to pray.

969
01:24:53,298 --> 01:24:58,196
I've waited all these years.

970
01:25:01,064 --> 01:25:08,520
I have done everything
You wanted.

971
01:25:12,231 --> 01:25:16,721
I love her.

972
01:25:16,831 --> 01:25:20,854
This can't be happening.

973
01:25:20,964 --> 01:25:25,488
God, I would, I would...

974
01:25:30,064 --> 01:25:33,519
Why are you laughing?

975
01:25:42,164 --> 01:25:44,527
What?

976
01:25:44,631 --> 01:25:47,392
What?

977
01:25:57,297 --> 01:25:58,127
A baby?

978
01:25:58,230 --> 01:26:02,253
A baby, yes.

979
01:26:14,597 --> 01:26:18,859
My mother and father named me
Obed, which means servant.

980
01:26:18,963 --> 01:26:22,327
And Naomi's life was fulfilled
again through the love of

981
01:26:22,430 --> 01:26:25,624
something as small as a newborn
child.

982
01:26:25,731 --> 01:26:29,356
Naomi loved and cared for me
throughout her days as if

983
01:26:29,464 --> 01:26:31,453
I were her own.

984
01:26:31,564 --> 01:26:33,655
Thank You.

985
01:26:33,763 --> 01:26:36,695
I know You're here with me.

986
01:26:36,796 --> 01:26:40,490
I know You always have been.

987
01:26:40,597 --> 01:26:44,619
Oh, and Lord, thank You so much
for little Obed.

988
01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:50,288
Protect him all of his days
and let this family continue

989
01:26:50,397 --> 01:26:53,487
to bless Israel.

990
01:27:00,063 --> 01:27:04,018
Think of your
great grandmother and Naomi.

991
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:08,256
If they had not trusted God
during the most difficult days

992
01:27:08,363 --> 01:27:14,956
of their lives, you and I would
not be sitting here today.

993
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:17,858
It is wonderful what God has
done for our ancestors, but how

994
01:27:17,963 --> 01:27:21,520
I know he will do that for me.

995
01:27:21,630 --> 01:27:28,426
Just because some man came and
told me that I'm gonna be king

996
01:27:28,529 --> 01:27:33,154
and anointed my head with oil
doesn’t mean that I will be.

997
01:27:33,262 --> 01:27:37,592
He gave you the strength
to fight a lion and a bear that

998
01:27:37,696 --> 01:27:40,820
were attacking your father's
sheep.

999
01:27:40,929 --> 01:27:46,294
If He will help you to protect
sheep, He will surely give you

1000
01:27:46,396 --> 01:27:51,385
wisdom and strength to be king.

1001
01:27:53,929 --> 01:27:56,088
Your father wants you
to come home and bring lunch

1002
01:27:56,196 --> 01:28:00,128
to your brothers.

1003
01:28:00,229 --> 01:28:05,991
Go and do what the Lord says.

1004
01:28:13,895 --> 01:28:16,588
Thank you.

1005
01:28:24,929 --> 01:28:30,828
David, you forgot this.
