Okay.

31
00:02:13,053 --> 00:02:15,143
- Oh my goodness.
- Go ahead, keep walking.

32
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:16,513
- I'm walking, don't let me fall.

33
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:18,463

35
00:02:20,113 --> 00:02:21,303

- I know, it's not gonna stop me.

37
00:02:23,949 --> 00:02:24,949
Keep right on going.

38
00:02:26,895 --> 00:02:28,156

39
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:29,736
- I got you, keep going.

40
00:02:30,613 --> 00:02:32,586
A little bit more, we're almost there.

41
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:35,407

- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

45
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:46,719
Oh my goodness.

46
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,053
I haven't seen y'all in forever.

47
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:49,423
I can't believe you didn't tell me.

48
00:02:49,423 --> 00:02:52,023
Oh my goodness, Lord.

49
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:53,276
Thank you, thank you.

50
00:03:23,116 --> 00:03:27,102
- Can I have everyone's attention, please?

51
00:03:27,102 --> 00:03:28,935
Lynn, come here, baby.

52
00:03:30,613 --> 00:03:32,943
I wanna thank everyone
for coming this evening

53
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:35,206
to Lynn's surprise birthday party.

54
00:03:36,543 --> 00:03:38,933
- Yes, thank you, baby.

55
00:03:38,933 --> 00:03:42,583
This has been incredible, such a surprise.

56
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:44,493
I thank you all for coming.

57
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:46,523
- I know you were very surprised, babe,

58
00:03:46,523 --> 00:03:49,485
but there's one more
thing that I need to do.

59
00:03:51,483 --> 00:03:53,783
You know that I love you, right?

60
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:54,843
- Yeah.

61
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:55,676
I love you, too.

62
00:03:57,013 --> 00:04:00,106
- Well, this is not just
a surprise birthday party,

63
00:04:01,093 --> 00:04:02,353
but I was hoping

64
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,563
that this would also become

65
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:06,846
an engagement party.

66
00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:10,473
- Babe, what are you doing?

67
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:19,666
- Lynn.

68
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:22,586
I love you very much.

69
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:25,683
And I was hoping

70
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,183
that you would do me the honor

71
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:29,576
of becoming my wife.

72
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:42,529
Will you marry me?

73
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:44,383
- Yes.

74
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:51,770
- I love you, babe.
- I love you, too.

75
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:16,923
- Man, look at her.

76
00:05:17,963 --> 00:05:19,543
She don't even want to get married.

77
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:21,063
- Yo, chill, man.

78
00:05:21,063 --> 00:05:23,163

And we gonna support whatever
he wanna do, all right?

81
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:28,726
- Excuse me.

82
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:32,366
You two have something you want to share?

83
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,866
- Oh nah, we good.

84
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,866
- Oh, I didn't think so.

85
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,237
- Yeah, I just keep it to myself.

86
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:42,383
- You, chill, man.

87
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,086
- Man, you know I don't like her.

88
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:49,603
- Girl, what's wrong?

89
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:52,493
You don't look like somebody
that just got engaged.

90
00:05:52,493 --> 00:05:53,773
- What, I'm cool.

91
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:54,623
I'm fine.

92
00:05:54,623 --> 00:05:55,856
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

93
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,281
- Girl, look at that fine
man you got over there.

94
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:01,173
You should be happy.

95
00:06:01,173 --> 00:06:03,236
- Only Jackson don't have any money.

96
00:06:04,193 --> 00:06:05,543
- Is he still working nights

97
00:06:05,543 --> 00:06:06,633
and going to school during the day?

98
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:10,606
- Hmm hmm, which leaves me at
home with that child of his.

99
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:14,996
- Just think, once he get
that big lawyer money,

00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:18,026

to worry about, girl.

101
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:20,901
- I wish he hurry up and get it.

102
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:22,673
- It's okay, girl.

103
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,643
He about to get it soon.

104
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:26,803
Now, let's go and enjoy this party.

110
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:38,140
- Oh, God.

111
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,413
Can you believe, I'm getting married?

112
00:06:39,413 --> 00:06:40,360

131
00:07:13,913 --> 00:07:15,233
- Hey, Lynn.

132
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:16,763
- You need to find yourself another man

133
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:18,083
to trick into marrying you.

134
00:07:18,083 --> 00:07:19,241

135
00:07:19,241 --> 00:07:20,613

137
00:07:22,003 --> 00:07:23,770

138
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,843
- B, let's get up out of here, man,

139
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:26,562
'for I say something I really regret.

140
00:07:26,562 --> 00:07:27,495
Let's go, man.

141
00:07:38,673 --> 00:07:40,696
- Hey, hey, I'm home!

142
00:07:43,952 --> 00:07:46,923
Lynn, I'll said, I'm home.

143
00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:48,702
- I heard you the first time.

144
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,293
You want me to turn cartwheels
because you're home?

145
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:54,183
- No, but asking your
husband how his day was

146
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,223
from time to time, what
would be a nice start.

147
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:58,202
- Have you seen these bills, hmm?

148
00:07:58,202 --> 00:07:59,763
They're all overdue.

149
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:02,003
And you're talking about
asking how your day was?

150
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:03,663
You can't be serious.

151
00:08:03,663 --> 00:08:05,866
- Yes, I'm very serious.

152
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:08,276
Mmm.
- Don't touch me.

153
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,453
- It's like that?

154
00:08:11,453 --> 00:08:13,373
After only six months?

155
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:14,523
- Have you not noticed?

156
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:17,783
- I'll tell you what I have noticed.

157
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:20,203
A wife that hasn't made love
to her husband in a month

158
00:08:20,203 --> 00:08:22,763
and seems to be letting
stress affect her marriage.

159
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:24,223
- Hmm hmm, go on and continue.

160
00:08:24,223 --> 00:08:25,333
- And I'll add,

161
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,363
that I'm starting to feel like
I'm in this marriage alone.

162
00:08:28,363 --> 00:08:30,193
- All right, let me be honest.

163
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:31,993
I thought I was marrying a man

164
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:33,962
that was going to be successful.

165
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:35,913
Not a man that's going to night school.

166
00:08:36,972 --> 00:08:38,702
- You talk as if I'm going to night school

167
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:41,013
to get my damn GED.

168
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:44,133
I'm six months away from being
done and taking my bar exam.

169
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,963
This close!

170
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:47,823
From my dreams becoming reality.

171
00:08:47,823 --> 00:08:51,193
- Look, I get having goals
and dreams and all of that.

172
00:08:51,193 --> 00:08:53,383
But I'm tired of struggling.

173
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:56,093
I want a house, a nice car to drive.

174
00:08:56,093 --> 00:08:58,093
You know the finer things in life.

175
00:08:58,093 --> 00:08:59,463
- I told you.

176
00:08:59,463 --> 00:09:01,703
Taking over to my parents'
company after they retired

177
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:03,733
was just an option in the event

178
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:05,743
that law school doesn't pan out.

179
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:07,783
- Well, it doesn't look
like it's working out to me.

180
00:09:07,783 --> 00:09:10,267
- Oh, I will run my own
law firm one day, Lynn.

181
00:09:10,267 --> 00:09:11,633
Now that's funny,

182
00:09:11,633 --> 00:09:13,763
because there's no way
that's going to happen.

183
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:16,453
- Wow, thanks for the encouragement.

184
00:09:16,453 --> 00:09:20,593
- Oh, I'm encouraging you
to run your family business.

185
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,163
There's no doubt we'll
be successful, then.

186
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25,733
- Your definition of success is what?

187
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,583
A big house?

188
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,813
A nice car?

189
00:09:28,813 --> 00:09:31,243
Oh, and these designer
clothes you like to be buying?

190
00:09:31,243 --> 00:09:32,973
- Hmm hmm, yes, why not?

191
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:36,173
You know Karen and her
man are very successful.

192
00:09:36,173 --> 00:09:37,393
Now he works

193
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:39,323
and she takes care of the new house

194
00:09:39,323 --> 00:09:41,363
they just had built from the ground up.

195
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:45,006
- Hmm hmm, and where's the
love in the relationship?

196
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,343
- Oh Karen loves her house

197
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:48,316
and her new car.

198
00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:52,253
- Let me tell you something.

199
00:09:52,253 --> 00:09:55,023
Love is about being there
through thick and thin.

200
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:57,493
It's not about what you
have or where you live.

201
00:09:57,493 --> 00:09:59,883
Those things are only temporary.

202
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:02,403
- Yeah, but what's
wrong with wanting more?

203
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:04,453
- Nothing, if you stay
committed to work together

204
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:06,143
to achieve those things!

205
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:10,413
- Look, I'm ready to see the
benefits of me being patient

206
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:12,416
and playing step mommy to your kid.

207
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:15,643
- Okay, you know what?

208
00:10:15,643 --> 00:10:18,193
We need to end this conversation
before things get out hand.

209
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:19,573
- Oh no, let's not.

210
00:10:19,573 --> 00:10:21,393
Go on, what's on your mind, Jackson?

211
00:10:21,393 --> 00:10:23,983
- No, I'm done with it, now.

212
00:10:23,983 --> 00:10:25,063
I'm tired!

213
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:29,043
- Look, when you're at work,
who's at home with her, huh?

214
00:10:29,043 --> 00:10:29,876
Me, that's who!

215
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:32,293
- And you should love her
like she's your own daughter.

216
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:34,096
- Oh, shut up, Jackson, I've tried.

217
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:40,906
- Listen.

218
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:45,423
Courtney's been with me
since she was two years old.

219
00:10:45,423 --> 00:10:48,316
When she was born, I wasn't
ready to be a father.

220
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:52,243
After her mother died, I
had to drop out of college,

221
00:10:52,243 --> 00:10:54,383
put my basketball career on hold,

222
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:56,513
grow up quick and become
a full-time father.

223
00:10:56,513 --> 00:10:57,663
And you know what?

224
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:00,071
I'm proud of the job I've done.

225
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:02,423
Whoop-de-do!

226
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:05,463
You also promised to
take care of me and her.

227
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:08,190
Because this right here
is not what I imagined.

228
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:10,573
- So what!

229
00:11:10,573 --> 00:11:12,149
So what, Lynn!

230
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:13,923
We don't have a big house or the Mercedes.

231
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:16,316
You and I, we have each other.

232
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,570
And if that's not enough,

233
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:22,373
I'm sorry, I don't know what it is.

234
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:24,206
- Look, I'm done talking about this.

235
00:11:26,313 --> 00:11:27,423
-  I think we need counseling.

236
00:11:27,423 --> 00:11:29,453
- No, I don't need any counseling.

237
00:11:29,453 --> 00:11:30,803
Good evening, Jackson.

238
00:11:30,803 --> 00:11:33,073
- Lynn.
- I am going upstairs.

239
00:11:33,073 --> 00:11:34,071
- Lynn!

240
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:35,631
- Get off of me!

241
00:11:41,023 --> 00:11:41,966
- Hey, girl.

242
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:44,523
Girl, I'm outside your house.

243
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:45,546
Come outside.

244
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:00,707
- Hey, girl.

245
00:12:00,707 --> 00:12:02,425
- Girl, this is nice.

246
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:03,443
- I know, right?

247
00:12:03,443 --> 00:12:04,963
Girl, that's why I had to stop by.

248
00:12:04,963 --> 00:12:07,296
I had to show you my new
car that my man bought me.

249
00:12:07,296 --> 00:12:10,093
- Your man, which man is it this week?

250
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:14,103
- My new man that bought
me this new car.

251
00:12:14,103 --> 00:12:15,443
- Well, what is the model?

252
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,243
- I don't know.

253
00:12:17,243 --> 00:12:19,233
Something fast!

254
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:21,663
- How do you not know
what kind of car you have?

255
00:12:21,663 --> 00:12:22,755
- It don't matter, girl.

256
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:24,230
I just matter that I'm not paying for it.

257
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,569
- I know that's right.

258
00:12:26,923 --> 00:12:30,093
Whew, chile, I remember those days, hmm.

259
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:32,083
We have all these bills.

260
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,183
We can't afford a new car.

261
00:12:34,183 --> 00:12:37,343
We can barely afford a Hyundai.

262
00:12:37,343 --> 00:12:39,403
- Well, he's close to graduating, right?

263
00:12:39,403 --> 00:12:41,713
- Yeah, he's close, but,

264
00:12:41,713 --> 00:12:42,673
I'm tired of waiting.

265
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:44,526
I'm ready to get what I deserve now.

266
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,143
- What you deserve?

267
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:48,993
Girl, that man is your husband.

268
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:50,243
He ain't your father.

269
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:53,349
- I know, but it's his
job to provide, right,

270
00:12:53,349 --> 00:12:55,403
and giving me everything that I want.

271
00:12:55,403 --> 00:12:56,733
I mean, if I can get it from him,

272
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:59,443
then I'm gonna have to
get it from my sponsor.

273
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:00,276
- Lynn?

274
00:13:00,276 --> 00:13:01,603
Your sponsor.

275
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:03,663
Are you saying what I think you saying?

276
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:06,068
- I'm saying what you think I'm saying?

277
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:07,513
But he's just a friend.

278
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:08,346
- Just a friend?

279
00:13:08,346 --> 00:13:11,203
Lynn, you are a married woman.

280
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:13,297
How do you have just friends?

281
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:15,596
- You know, it just kind of happened.

282
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:18,265
- Girl, how does cheating just happen?

283
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,826
- He was someone that I confided in.

284
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,140
Ah, this is him now, hold on.

285
00:13:25,023 --> 00:13:25,866
Hey, baby.

286
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:27,972
How are you doing?

287
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:31,824
Can I give you a call back in a minute?

288
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:33,623
All right, will do.

289
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:37,923
What?

290
00:13:37,923 --> 00:13:39,919
Why are you looking at me like that?

291
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,843
- Like, I'm about to ask you

292
00:13:40,843 --> 00:13:42,443
if you creeping on your husband?

293
00:13:44,143 --> 00:13:46,463
- Listen, it's none of your concern.

294
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:48,523
He is just a friend.

295
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:49,733
- Okay, just a friend.

296
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:52,853
Well, listen, I'm gonna mind
my business in my new car.

297
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:55,443
But for real though, I love you, okay.

298
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:57,943
And I think you really need to
fix that before it fixes you.

299
00:13:57,943 --> 00:14:00,473
- Hmm, I'm good.

300
00:14:00,473 --> 00:14:02,143
Listen, when are you
gonna take me on a ride

301
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:03,246
in this new car?

302
00:14:04,223 --> 00:14:05,803
- You crazy,

303
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,546
but we can ride out right now.

304
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:08,626
Let's go!

305
00:14:10,793 --> 00:14:13,203
- Jack, B, what's up man?

306
00:14:13,203 --> 00:14:15,223
Mind telling me where the party at?

307
00:14:15,223 --> 00:14:16,933
- Yo man, I just got here.

308
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:17,773
This fool been sitting here

309
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,843
like he just lost his best friend, man.

310
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:20,676
- What's up man?

311
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:22,266
What's going on, man?

312
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:24,016
Everything all right?

313
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:27,420
- Man, this marriage this is hard, man.

314
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,863
- Oh, so y'all having some issues?

315
00:14:29,863 --> 00:14:31,913
- Every day, she whining about something.

316
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:35,143
One day, it's about bills.

317
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:35,976
The next day,

318
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:38,603
it's about me not wanting to
take over the family business.

319
00:14:39,621 --> 00:14:41,273
Man, real talk,

320
00:14:41,273 --> 00:14:43,786
I couldn't even tell you the
last time I've gotten some.

321
00:14:46,223 --> 00:14:47,473
- You ain't getting none?

322
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:49,496
Look, man, we tried to tell you

323
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:51,713
what she would like from the jump.

324
00:14:51,713 --> 00:14:53,383
She a gold digger!

325
00:14:53,383 --> 00:14:54,383
-  What are you talking about?

326
00:14:54,383 --> 00:14:57,853
- Man, things ain't happening
fast enough for her, man.

327
00:14:57,853 --> 00:14:59,336
She can't handle with, Jack.

328
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,143
- Nah, she just mad because

329
00:15:03,143 --> 00:15:05,093
I haven't been able to give
her the things that she wants.

330
00:15:05,093 --> 00:15:06,183
- Come on, man.

331
00:15:06,183 --> 00:15:08,123
Don't start doing that to yourself.

332
00:15:08,123 --> 00:15:09,143
- Don't start doing what?

333
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:10,943
- Blaming yourself for her ways!

334
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,323
- I'm not blaming myself, Tracy.

335
00:15:13,323 --> 00:15:14,300
But, maybe I should listen to her

336
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,653
and take over the family business.

337
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:18,713
We wouldn't be hurting so
much financially, like we are.

338
00:15:18,713 --> 00:15:21,053
- Bro, you need to come out of that.

339
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,833
Like real talk.

340
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,303
This for rich or for poor.

341
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:25,486
- Till death do you part, right?

342
00:15:25,486 --> 00:15:27,493
- Man, so what, everything tight.

343
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,393
That's everywhere.

344
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,853
She can't accept that?

345
00:15:30,853 --> 00:15:32,316
She just showing you who she really is.

346
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:33,296
- Man, I knew it was
something about this girl

347
00:15:33,296 --> 00:15:34,543
I ain't like, man.

348
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:35,613
- Really?

349
00:15:35,613 --> 00:15:37,802
- Fellas, she wasn't like
that in the beginning, man.

350
00:15:37,802 --> 00:15:38,756
I...

351
00:15:38,756 --> 00:15:40,233
I don't know what changed.

352
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:42,533
- Bro, nothing changed.

353
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:44,103
You was just so caught up in her, man,

354
00:15:44,103 --> 00:15:46,153
you didn't see her for the real her.

355
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,063
- Look, man.

356
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:49,363
All relationships go
through rocky situations.

357
00:15:50,823 --> 00:15:52,643
And they resort to counseling.

358
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:53,703
Y'all tried that?

359
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:56,883
- I mentioned it to her
numerous times about going,

360
00:15:56,883 --> 00:15:59,496
but she just keeps
shooting that idea down.

361
00:16:01,013 --> 00:16:02,483
- Bro, you hurt.

362
00:16:02,483 --> 00:16:04,183
And I don't like to see that.

363
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:05,693
- What makes you think I'm hurting?

364
00:16:05,693 --> 00:16:06,843
- Oh, you hurting, bro.

365
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,323
- Man, you sitting there by yourself.

366
00:16:10,323 --> 00:16:11,613
Two empty glasses

367
00:16:12,653 --> 00:16:13,723
and you telling me

368
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:16,493
and B

369
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:18,693
that your girl ain't giving you none.

370
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:20,263
Bro, you hurt.

371
00:16:20,263 --> 00:16:21,573
- Yo, you think she might be cheating?

372
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:22,613
- Yep.

373
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:23,593
- Nah, she's not cheating.

374
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:26,663
- I mean, I ain't saying she cheating,

375
00:16:26,663 --> 00:16:28,413
just something to think about, man.

376
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:34,106
-  I'm going to the bathroom, man.

377
00:16:40,486 --> 00:16:43,823
- Man, I told you a long time
ago, I ain't trust that girl.

378
00:16:43,823 --> 00:16:45,536
- Man, I ain't trying
to hear all that, man.

379
00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:49,733
-  Fellas,

380
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:51,233
I'm gonna shut it down early tonight, man.

381
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:52,703
- What?
- That's a good idea, man.

382
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:54,881
-  I gotta go talk to the wife.

383
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,458
All right?
- Damn.

384
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,963
- Let's go.
- Let's be out.

385
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:01,130
- Just gonna roll on me, huh?
- Really?

386
00:17:11,173 --> 00:17:13,459
- Girl, what you got up in that bag?

387
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:15,783
- Oh, it is so cute.

388
00:17:15,783 --> 00:17:17,162
And I got it on sale.

389
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,335
- Whew, you know I love a good sale, girl.

390
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:22,003
Jackson is going to love that.

391
00:17:22,003 --> 00:17:24,315
- Hmph, you sure it's right for Jackson?

392
00:17:25,214 --> 00:17:26,520
- What you gonna do with that thing?

393
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,443
- Oh, my man is going to love me in this.

394
00:17:28,443 --> 00:17:30,243
- You've got to give me all the details.

395
00:17:30,243 --> 00:17:32,153
- You know I'm going to
give you all the details,

396
00:17:32,153 --> 00:17:34,313
come on now.

397
00:17:34,313 --> 00:17:36,136
I am going to put it on him.

398
00:17:38,003 --> 00:17:39,614
- 20% off.

399
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:41,293
Girl, now you know we got
to go up in this store.

400
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:43,363
-  You know, I've been
wanting to check this store out

401
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:44,875
for the longest.

402
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:59,381
- Ooh, baby, that's going
to look so good on you.

403
00:17:59,381 --> 00:18:01,473
- I know, Mr. Jackson.

404
00:18:01,473 --> 00:18:03,713
- So why don't you put it on?

405
00:18:04,763 --> 00:18:06,396
So I can take it off.

406
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:09,893
- No, I'm going to bed.

407
00:18:09,893 --> 00:18:11,296
- Can we talk about what's going on?

408
00:18:11,296 --> 00:18:12,646
- Good night, Jackson.

409
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,203
- Damn!

410
00:18:29,256 --> 00:18:31,043
Thanks for seeing me today, Rev.

411
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:31,903
- Oh, anytime.

412
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,573
You know I always have time
for one of my favorite members.

413
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:35,406
How's Lynn?

414
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:38,813
- That's why I'm here to discuss.

415
00:18:39,703 --> 00:18:42,133
Seems like we hit a rough
patch in our marriage.

416
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,943
- Explain, Jackson.

417
00:18:43,943 --> 00:18:44,776
I'm listening.

418
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:47,766
- I don't want it to seem like

419
00:18:47,766 --> 00:18:49,573
I'm going behind my wife's
back talking to you.

420
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:50,406
I just...

421
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:53,483
- Hmph, I'm your spiritual
leader as well as hers.

422
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:54,316
Let's talk.

423
00:18:57,973 --> 00:18:59,726
- I really don't know where to begin.

424
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:03,193
- Hmm, well, just start
from the beginning.

425
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:05,206
We got all the time in the world.

426
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:10,983
-  Well...

427
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:15,696
Basically, Lynn's not interested
in being married anymore.

428
00:19:16,593 --> 00:19:18,766
- Hmm, what makes you feel that way?

429
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,603
- Because, she's always complaining

430
00:19:22,603 --> 00:19:23,813
that I don't make enough money

431
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:27,400
and mad that I haven't taken
over the family business.

432
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,786
-  Is that all?

433
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:31,963
- I feel funny saying this,

434
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:35,516
but she's not even giving me any, Rev.

435
00:19:36,413 --> 00:19:37,563
- Giving you any, what?

436
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:40,243
- No sex.

437
00:19:40,243 --> 00:19:42,163
She's not giving me no sex.

438
00:19:42,163 --> 00:19:45,216
- Hmm, what are you doing
to work on your marriage?

439
00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:47,903
- What do you mean?

440
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:50,243
- I mean, you made a vow to provide.

441
00:19:50,243 --> 00:19:52,813
Are you following through with that part?

442
00:19:52,813 --> 00:19:55,653
- Shouldn't it be about more
than just providing, though?

443
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,083
- Yeah, it should be, but
you know what they say?

444
00:19:58,083 --> 00:20:00,526
There's no romance without finance.

445
00:20:01,446 --> 00:20:04,843
Have you at
least prayed about it?

446
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:07,853
- Rev, I pray all day, every day about it.

447
00:20:07,853 --> 00:20:12,053
- Hmm, well maybe you two
ain't meant to get married.

448
00:20:12,053 --> 00:20:13,356
Divorce may be an option.

449
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,183
- Per this Bible?

450
00:20:16,183 --> 00:20:18,040
Divorce is not an option.

451
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,143
- Hmm, I'm just saying,

452
00:20:21,143 --> 00:20:24,213
Lynn is a very, very attractive woman

453
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:25,163
and you can't force nobody

454
00:20:25,163 --> 00:20:27,296
to stay in something
they don't want to be in.

455
00:20:28,273 --> 00:20:30,303
- I came here to get help

456
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:33,013
and all I'm hearing from
you is get a divorce?

457
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:33,846
- I'm just saying,

458
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:35,533
if you can't provide the type of lifestyle

459
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:37,103
that she's accustomed to,

460
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:39,543
maybe you should let somebody else do it.

461
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:41,853
I mean, I know it don't sound easy,

462
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:44,166
but, I'm just keeping
it real with you, bro.

463
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:47,323
- Are you serious right now?

464
00:20:47,323 --> 00:20:51,553
-  You can't make
somebody stay in something

465
00:20:51,553 --> 00:20:53,620
they don't want to be in, my brother.

466
00:20:56,053 --> 00:20:57,833
Hold on a second.

467
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:58,666
Hello?

468
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,176
Hey, what's up sweetie?

469
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,323
Okay.

470
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:06,156
All right.

471
00:21:07,843 --> 00:21:09,749
- Wow, that's beautiful.

472
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:12,233
Your wife calls just to check on you.

473
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:15,146
- Yeah, she loves her some Reverend Smith.

474
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:20,013
Anyway, hey man,
I got to get ready to go.

475
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:20,853
I gotta cut this short.

476
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:22,993
I got an appointment I gotta make it to.

477
00:21:22,993 --> 00:21:24,303
- Hey, but you said-

478
00:21:24,303 --> 00:21:27,143
- I understand man, but
something, something came up,

479
00:21:27,143 --> 00:21:29,936
so uh, look, I'm gonna be
praying for both of y'all.

480
00:21:32,183 --> 00:21:33,016
- All right.

481
00:21:34,323 --> 00:21:35,460
Thanks for seeing me again, Rev.

482
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,953
- Ah, no problem, my brother.

483
00:21:36,953 --> 00:21:38,126
Anytime.
- Yeah.

484
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,060
-  Yeah.

485
00:21:51,128 --> 00:21:52,263
Yeah.

486
00:21:52,263 --> 00:21:54,200
- Hey, where are you?

487
00:21:55,663 --> 00:21:56,496
The gym?

488
00:21:57,843 --> 00:21:59,243
Okay.

489
00:21:59,243 --> 00:22:01,353
I'll see you when you get home.

490
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,676
All right, bye.

491
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,126
- Hey, sexy.

492
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:13,583
You just missed Jackson.

493
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,242
He just left here requesting help for you.

494
00:22:16,242 --> 00:22:18,753
-  Do you think he saw me?

495
00:22:18,753 --> 00:22:20,853
- Of course not. I told
him I had to cut it short

496
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:22,646
so I can meet up with my wife.

497
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:25,808
- And just where's that wife of yours?

498
00:22:25,808 --> 00:22:26,960
- Hmm, that's not important.

499
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,899
You're here.

500
00:22:28,899 --> 00:22:30,153
And she's not.

501
00:22:30,153 --> 00:22:31,883
That's all that matters.

502
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,992
- Well, did you tell him
that you're sexing me?

503
00:22:33,992 --> 00:22:37,233
- Nah, but I told him you deserve better.

504
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:38,580
- And who's gonna give me the best?

505
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,473
- Me, of course.

506
00:22:40,473 --> 00:22:42,416
Soon as I get some things situated.

507
00:22:43,983 --> 00:22:45,114
- Don't keep me waiting.

508
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,796
You know, I have needs, you know?

509
00:22:46,796 --> 00:22:48,893
- Hmm, well you better get outta here

510
00:22:48,893 --> 00:22:51,383
before your husband get a
whiff of what we got going on.

511
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:54,475
I see you later on tonight, baby.

512
00:22:54,475 --> 00:22:56,337
- All right.
- All right.

513
00:23:04,756 --> 00:23:07,147

- How you feeling?

517
00:23:15,278 --> 00:23:16,578
- A little tired.
- Yeah?

518
00:23:18,483 --> 00:23:19,643
- Yeah.

519
00:23:19,643 --> 00:23:22,141
- I've been waiting for you all day.

520
00:23:22,141 --> 00:23:23,943
- Yeah, you know I had
to wrap up some business

521
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:25,295
at the church first.

522
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:27,462
- Oh, well, you look nice.

523
00:23:28,602 --> 00:23:31,025

525

What's on your mind?

526
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:40,403
- Jackson was acting really strange

527
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:41,873
before he left this evening.

528
00:23:43,108 --> 00:23:47,170
-  You think has a clue
that you plan on leaving him?

529
00:23:48,916 --> 00:23:49,749
- No.

530
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,093
All he talks about is counseling

531
00:23:52,093 --> 00:23:55,300
and he's so caught up
what he's going through,

532
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,758
he doesn't have a clue.

533
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:58,696
- No, don't underestimate Jackson.

534
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:02,914
You need to be careful about
having me come by here.

535
00:24:02,914 --> 00:24:05,255
- Hmm, at this point, I don't really care.

536
00:24:05,255 --> 00:24:07,588
- Nah, it's not that simple.

537
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:12,423
- It's simple for me.

538
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:14,654
I mean, you don't want us to be together?

539
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:15,487
- Of course.

540
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:17,100
But, you know we gotta wait

541
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,966
until the time is right for both of us.

542
00:24:22,497 --> 00:24:24,095
- All right.

543
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,935
I'll be patient for you.

544
00:24:25,935 --> 00:24:28,461
- Hmm, that's what I like to hear.

545
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:32,524
- Come on, let's get
this party started then.

546
00:24:32,524 --> 00:24:34,303
♪ Got me like this ♪

547
00:24:34,303 --> 00:24:35,995
♪ Oh, this must be love ♪

548
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:40,476
♪ Is this love? ♪

549
00:24:44,797 --> 00:24:46,953
- Do you know when my dad will be home?

550
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:49,326
- Courtney, your dad
will be home soon, okay?

551
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:53,163
- Well, can you help me with my homework?

552
00:24:53,163 --> 00:24:54,893
- No, I'm busy right now.

553
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,963
- You're always too busy to help me.

554
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:59,426
- Hey, watch your mouth
when you're talking to me.

555
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,173
- Well, my dad always
helps me with homework.

556
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:05,146
- Then, your day can
help when he gets home.

557
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:10,502
Go to your room while I take this call.

558
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:18,956
- Hey, baby, how you doing?

559
00:25:20,303 --> 00:25:22,987
Yeah, I'm here with the brat right now.

560
00:25:25,283 --> 00:25:26,683
Her dad should be home soon.

561
00:25:27,823 --> 00:25:28,873
So I'll see you soon.

562
00:25:30,443 --> 00:25:32,066
Okay, all right.

563
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:40,876
- Was that my dad?

564
00:25:42,263 --> 00:25:44,263
- Didn't I tell you to go to your room?

565
00:25:44,263 --> 00:25:45,603
What am I going to do with you?

566
00:25:45,603 --> 00:25:47,613
- Nothing, like you always do!

567
00:25:47,613 --> 00:25:49,093
- Sit your tail down.

568
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:53,966
- Hey, what are my
favorite girls watching?

569
00:25:57,883 --> 00:25:59,293
Hey baby.

570
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:00,386
Daddy don't get no hug?

571
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:03,004
How you doing?
- Good.

572
00:26:03,004 --> 00:26:03,837
- Good.

573
00:26:05,683 --> 00:26:07,853
Lynn, that includes you, too.

574
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:08,940
- Hmm hmm.

575
00:26:10,453 --> 00:26:12,096
- How was your day?

576
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,929
Did you miss me?

577
00:26:14,055 --> 00:26:14,955
- My day was fine.

578
00:26:15,913 --> 00:26:17,246
And no, I didn't miss you.

579
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,113
- That's all right, well at
least one of my girls did.

580
00:26:20,113 --> 00:26:21,085
Right, Courtney?
- Yep.

581
00:26:21,918 --> 00:26:24,883
- And for the record,
I'm a grown ass woman.

582
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:25,813
- Hey!

583
00:26:25,813 --> 00:26:27,686
Watch your mouth around my daughter!

584
00:26:28,693 --> 00:26:30,163
And I'll assume, that once again,

585
00:26:30,163 --> 00:26:31,673
that you didn't cook dinner!

586
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,216
- And you will assume, right.

587
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,049
I was a busy.

588
00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:35,593
Is that okay, your majesty?

589
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,220
- Busy doing what?

590
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,003
You don't work!

591
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:40,163
- Look, I didn't get married

592
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:42,593
to wait hand and foot on you two.

593
00:26:42,593 --> 00:26:44,020
- Courtney.
- Hmm?

594
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,520
- Go to your room, sweetheart.

595
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,713
- Would you like to tell
me what you did today

596
00:26:55,713 --> 00:26:57,303
that kept you so busy?

597
00:26:57,303 --> 00:26:58,136
- Nope.

598
00:26:59,103 --> 00:27:00,153
Not really.

599
00:27:00,153 --> 00:27:02,053
- You want a divorce?

600
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,683
Is that it, Lynn!

601
00:27:03,683 --> 00:27:05,986
- Jackson, I don't know what I want.

602
00:27:07,033 --> 00:27:09,643
I just need some time to
think about all of this, okay?

603
00:27:09,643 --> 00:27:12,123
- You know what?
- Just give me 50 feet.

604
00:27:12,123 --> 00:27:13,333
Please.
- You know what?

605
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,683
Take all the time you need.

606
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,550
I'm going to bed.

607
00:27:17,583 --> 00:27:19,223
Good night.

608
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:22,163
Somebody has to work around
here to pay these bills.

609
00:27:22,163 --> 00:27:24,246
- Hmm, barely.
- Yeah, whatever.

610
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:39,433
- Whew boy, I know you
didn't call me over here

611
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:41,525
'cause you want me to work
out with you, now, did you?

612
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:42,358
- Ah, hey, mama.

613
00:27:42,358 --> 00:27:45,193
- 'Cause, you know, I ain't
doing it.

614
00:27:45,193 --> 00:27:46,143
- How you doing?

615
00:27:46,143 --> 00:27:46,976
- I'm good, baby.

616
00:27:46,976 --> 00:27:48,065
How you doing?

617
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:50,113
-  Thanks so much for coming, mama.

618
00:27:50,113 --> 00:27:50,946
- Okay.

619
00:27:50,946 --> 00:27:52,313
- I really need to talk to you.

620
00:27:52,313 --> 00:27:53,865
- Well, what's wrong, baby?

621
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:56,966
-  It's more like,
what's not wrong, mama.

622
00:27:58,673 --> 00:27:59,506
I mean...

623
00:28:01,123 --> 00:28:02,373
- Talk to me.

624
00:28:06,503 --> 00:28:09,213
- It feels like my marriage is crumbling

625
00:28:09,213 --> 00:28:11,033
right before my eyes.

626
00:28:11,033 --> 00:28:12,696
- Hmm.

627
00:28:12,696 --> 00:28:14,196
- You know, bills are overdue.

628
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:18,093
Lynn and Courtney, they
can't stand each other.

629
00:28:20,163 --> 00:28:22,236
- It's just starting
to become overwhelming.

630
00:28:23,643 --> 00:28:25,736
- Well, baby, what can I do to help?

631
00:28:27,287 --> 00:28:28,853
- Oh mama, I know you can help,

632
00:28:28,853 --> 00:28:30,793
but I'm a grown man

633
00:28:31,645 --> 00:28:32,995
with a wife and a daughter.

634
00:28:34,121 --> 00:28:36,143
There's no way I'm allowing
my mama to pay my bills.

635
00:28:36,143 --> 00:28:38,013
- Uh uh, boy, you better stop that.

636
00:28:38,013 --> 00:28:40,213
Now, there's nothing wrong with
you needing help, sometimes.

637
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:42,083
I don't care what your daddy said.

638
00:28:42,083 --> 00:28:43,933
And don't you let your pride keep you

639
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:45,783
from asking for that help.

640
00:28:45,783 --> 00:28:48,223
Now, your father and I
worked hard for our children.

641
00:28:48,223 --> 00:28:51,283
Just like you working
hard for your family.

642
00:28:51,283 --> 00:28:53,186
Now, how can I help you?

643
00:28:55,613 --> 00:28:56,446
- Well, I also want to talk to you

644
00:28:56,446 --> 00:28:57,973
about the family business.

645
00:28:57,973 --> 00:29:01,066
- Ah, what about the family business?

646
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,013
- I was wondering if the
offer was still on the table

647
00:29:04,013 --> 00:29:05,206
to run the business.

648
00:29:06,223 --> 00:29:09,863
- Baby, it's never been off the table,

649
00:29:09,863 --> 00:29:12,243
but you were never interested.

650
00:29:12,243 --> 00:29:13,076
Why now?

651
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:15,625
- Lynn's been sweating me about it.

652
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:18,753
You know, she's complaining about bills

653
00:29:18,753 --> 00:29:20,810
and not being able to buy
a new house and a car.

654
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,913
- Are you serious?

655
00:29:21,913 --> 00:29:23,027
- Yes, I'm serious.

656
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,359
- Oh!

657
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,893
- Look, it's to the point
where I'm beginning to feel

658
00:29:25,893 --> 00:29:27,553
like she might be having an affair.

659
00:29:27,553 --> 00:29:29,313
- Oh, boy, uh uh, don't you say that.

660
00:29:29,313 --> 00:29:30,146
- Hey, listen.

661
00:29:30,146 --> 00:29:31,943
I don't want to believe it, mama,

662
00:29:31,943 --> 00:29:34,283
but something in my spirit

663
00:29:34,283 --> 00:29:36,423
just telling me something not right.

664
00:29:36,423 --> 00:29:38,473
- So now let me get this straight.

665
00:29:38,473 --> 00:29:39,973
You thinking about quitting school

666
00:29:39,973 --> 00:29:41,953
and giving up on your
dream of becoming a lawyer,

667
00:29:41,953 --> 00:29:44,843
for that gold digging wife of yours?

668
00:29:44,843 --> 00:29:47,543
Oh Lord, I'm sorry, let me stop.

669
00:29:47,543 --> 00:29:49,706
But I feel like she don't love, no how.

670
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:52,703
- Mama, why would you
say something like that?

671
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:55,983
- Hmm, baby, truth of the matter is,

672
00:29:55,983 --> 00:29:57,353
your daddy and I always felt like

673
00:29:57,353 --> 00:29:59,406
she only married you for the business.

674
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:05,306
- I didn't know y'all felt like that.

675
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:07,423
- Well, baby.

676
00:30:07,423 --> 00:30:09,573
If you like it, we loved it.

677
00:30:09,573 --> 00:30:12,013
But sorry, it's better
that you hear it from us

678
00:30:12,013 --> 00:30:13,446
than somebody else.

679
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:17,204
- I wish dad was here.

680
00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:19,533
- I know, baby.

681
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:20,366
I do, too.

682
00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:25,046
- How do I fix this?

683
00:30:27,313 --> 00:30:31,616
- Well, you can start by not
giving up on your dreams.

684
00:30:33,606 --> 00:30:35,206
And then you can try counseling.

685
00:30:37,244 --> 00:30:38,743
- I told Lynn, we needed
to go to counselor.

686
00:30:38,743 --> 00:30:40,253
She just feels like we don't need to go.

687
00:30:40,253 --> 00:30:45,253
- Hmm, well baby, this is
all the counseling you need.

688
00:30:48,993 --> 00:30:50,920
And I need to say something to you.

689
00:30:52,703 --> 00:30:53,663
I gotta be honest.

690
00:30:53,663 --> 00:30:55,493
And I know it might hurt your feelings.

691
00:30:55,493 --> 00:31:00,399
But , I need to say it.

692
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,482
- About what?

693
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:06,433
- Honey, the old folks always say

694
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:08,850
when a woman don't want to
make it work with a good man,

695
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,876
it's because she already
getting under another man.

696
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:15,453
Now I know that might hurt your feelings,

697
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:16,866
but now, truth is truth.

698
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,738
- Nah, mama.

699
00:31:19,738 --> 00:31:20,871
I don't believe that.

700
00:31:20,871 --> 00:31:21,704
I don't believe that.

701
00:31:21,704 --> 00:31:23,836
I think she's just upset
about our finances,

702
00:31:24,813 --> 00:31:25,646
you know, but,

703
00:31:26,686 --> 00:31:27,519
I don't believe that.

704
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,436
- Oh, oh okay then, baby.

705
00:31:30,613 --> 00:31:32,383
Well, I tell you what.

706
00:31:32,383 --> 00:31:33,716
When Lynn get home,

707
00:31:34,753 --> 00:31:36,353
you talk to her

708
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:39,463
and you find out what the problem is

709
00:31:40,403 --> 00:31:41,846
and you fix it.

710
00:31:43,493 --> 00:31:45,043
- I appreciate the advice, mom.

711
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:47,393
- All right, baby.

712
00:31:47,393 --> 00:31:48,233
I'm going home

713
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:50,133
and work on my greens.

714
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:52,003
I'm cooking greens for Sunday dinner.

715
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:53,452
- All right.
- Y'all oughta come over.

716
00:31:54,807 --> 00:31:56,313
Keep pumping that iron, boy!

717
00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:57,509
You looking good.

718
00:32:14,513 --> 00:32:16,643
- Lynn said she had an appointment today.

719
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,073
I want to see exactly what she's doing

720
00:32:18,073 --> 00:32:19,413
every day when I'm at work.

721
00:32:19,413 --> 00:32:20,873
- Man, you need me to
hire you a private eye?

722
00:32:20,873 --> 00:32:23,933
- Nah, I don't need no
private eye, scratch that.

723
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:25,773
I am going to see exactly
what's on her computer

724
00:32:25,773 --> 00:32:27,451
to see if anything is on that.

725
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:28,923
- That's what's up.

726
00:32:28,923 --> 00:32:32,373
Hey man, who keys is these?

727
00:32:32,373 --> 00:32:34,213
I thought you said, won't nobody here.

728
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:35,483
- Shouldn't nobody be here.

729
00:32:35,483 --> 00:32:37,163
Let me see those keys.

730
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:43,903
- You heard that?

731
00:32:45,347 --> 00:32:47,266
That came from upstairs.

732
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:50,246
Hey man, somebody upstairs.

733
00:32:51,358 --> 00:32:52,567
I'm going to get my gun.

734
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:53,908
- Hey, hey, nah, Tracy.

735
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:55,419
I don't want her to
think I'm spying on her.

736
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:59,653
- And I heard that again.

737
00:32:59,653 --> 00:33:01,063
Somebody upstairs.
- Hey, Tracy!

738
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:04,346
- Come on, man.

739
00:33:07,763 --> 00:33:09,443
- Jackson, what are you doing here?

740
00:33:09,443 --> 00:33:11,133
- The question is, what
are you doing here?

741
00:33:11,133 --> 00:33:12,533
I thought you were at the gym!

742
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,283
- Yeah, babe, I, I'm,
I'm getting ready to go.

743
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,286
I just gotta put my clothes on

744
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:16,868
and you can walk me downstairs.

745
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:18,943
- You ready to get this party
started? Oh shoot, Jackson.

746
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:20,683
- Man, what the hell are you doing here?

747
00:33:20,683 --> 00:33:22,033
- Look, man, it's not what you think, bro.

748
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,823
- Man, you in my house!

749
00:33:23,823 --> 00:33:25,243
Half naked!

750
00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:27,087
And it's not what I think?

751
00:33:27,087 --> 00:33:28,753
- Jackson, come on. You
were supposed to be at work.

752
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:29,586
What are you doing here?

753
00:33:29,586 --> 00:33:31,313
- I'll tell you what I'm doing.

754
00:33:31,313 --> 00:33:33,583
Catching my wife with
this fake ass preacher.

755
00:33:33,583 --> 00:33:34,633
- Look, man, let me explain, bro.

756
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:37,333
- Man, the only thing you need to do, man,

757
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,236
is stay the hell up out of my face.

758
00:33:40,163 --> 00:33:41,693
- Come on, Jackson, I'm sorry.

759
00:33:41,693 --> 00:33:43,913
Now, you know, we've been having problems.

760
00:33:43,913 --> 00:33:45,153
- So you decided to screw around

761
00:33:45,153 --> 00:33:46,843
because we're having problems?

762
00:33:46,843 --> 00:33:48,721
- Look, man, can we talk
about this, man to man?

763
00:33:48,721 --> 00:33:49,977
- Man, hell nah!

764
00:33:55,713 --> 00:33:57,276
- Look, I'm sorry, okay?

765
00:33:58,293 --> 00:33:59,126
I'm really sorry.

766
00:33:59,126 --> 00:33:59,983
- You know what?

767
00:33:59,983 --> 00:34:01,893
You two deserve each other.

768
00:34:01,893 --> 00:34:03,216
I hope it was worth it!

769
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:07,626
- Look, I'm sorry.

770
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:10,298
That's all I can say.

771
00:34:11,333 --> 00:34:12,432
- Yeah, you sorry, all right.

772
00:34:12,432 --> 00:34:15,538
- You a sorry ass excuse for a woman!

773
00:34:15,538 --> 00:34:18,117
And I should lay these
hands on you, my man.

774
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:20,996
But it's best, I let God handle you.

775
00:34:20,996 --> 00:34:24,432
Man, you got 30 seconds
to get up out of my house!

776
00:34:24,432 --> 00:34:27,123
And in case you didn't know, it's over!

777
00:34:27,123 --> 00:34:28,452
- Can we at least talk?

778
00:34:28,452 --> 00:34:30,863
- There's nothing for us to talk about.

779
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:32,893
- I only went to him for counseling.

780
00:34:32,893 --> 00:34:33,843
- You went for counseling

781
00:34:33,843 --> 00:34:37,588
and just happen to wind up screwing him?

782
00:34:37,588 --> 00:34:40,303
- No, no, I mean, look, I
don't know what to say, okay?

783
00:34:40,303 --> 00:34:41,393
It just happened.

784
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:42,793
- So, it just happened, huh?

785
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,242
- Yeah.

786
00:34:45,242 --> 00:34:46,593
Yes.

787
00:34:46,593 --> 00:34:49,303
And I might as well be honest with you.

788
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:50,833
We're going to be together.

789
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:52,313
- Together?

790
00:34:52,313 --> 00:34:55,030
You think this man gonna
leave his wife for you?

791
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,153
You can't be that stupid.

792
00:34:57,153 --> 00:34:59,083
- Look, that's what he told me.

793
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,783
And I believe him.

794
00:35:00,783 --> 00:35:03,273
- You have to be out show rabbit ass mind,

795
00:35:03,273 --> 00:35:05,313
if you think this man gonna leave his wife

796
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:06,146
for the likes of you!

797
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:07,963
- And what the hell is
that supposed to mean?

798
00:35:07,963 --> 00:35:11,803
- It means a man doesn't leave
his wife for his mistress,

799
00:35:11,803 --> 00:35:14,173
his jump off or whatever
it is you are to him.

800
00:35:14,173 --> 00:35:16,023
- Look, I'm more than a mistress.

801
00:35:16,023 --> 00:35:17,623
I'm a hundred percent woman, okay.

802
00:35:17,623 --> 00:35:18,746
And he knows that!

803
00:35:20,363 --> 00:35:22,723
He knows I deserve the
finer things in life.

804
00:35:22,723 --> 00:35:25,803
- So this is all about you
wanting the finer things in life?

805
00:35:25,803 --> 00:35:27,523
- And there's nothing that
you can provide for me

806
00:35:27,523 --> 00:35:30,313
with that low-paying job that you have.

807
00:35:30,313 --> 00:35:32,133
You have a wife and a daughter!

808
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:34,423
And you're a fork lift driver.

809
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,313
How can you expect to take
care of us off of that salary?

810
00:35:37,313 --> 00:35:39,043
- Let me tell you something.

811
00:35:39,043 --> 00:35:41,553
This forklift driver works hard every day

812
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:42,973
to provide a roof for you,

813
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:45,623
food in the refrigerator
and gas in your car.

814
00:35:45,623 --> 00:35:47,263
- You call that out there, a car?

815
00:35:47,263 --> 00:35:49,753
- So he promised you a car, huh?

816
00:35:49,753 --> 00:35:52,533
- As a matter of fact, yes, he did.

817
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:54,733
- So let me get this straight.

818
00:35:54,733 --> 00:35:57,063
He told you he was leaving his wife,

819
00:35:57,063 --> 00:35:58,243
buying you a car

820
00:35:58,243 --> 00:36:01,023
and getting you everything
you deserve, right?

821
00:36:01,023 --> 00:36:02,108
- That's right.

822
00:36:02,108 --> 00:36:04,857
- Oh Lynn, Lynn, Lynn, Lynn.

823
00:36:04,857 --> 00:36:07,219
You a lot dumber than I imagined.

824
00:36:07,219 --> 00:36:10,813
- Look, you can call it
whatever you want, okay?

825
00:36:10,813 --> 00:36:13,163
I'll be well taken care of with him.

826
00:36:13,163 --> 00:36:15,573
- Wow, you that shallow

827
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,313
that you're willing to
walk out on your marriage

828
00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:19,173
for a married man?

829
00:36:19,173 --> 00:36:20,363
- Say what you wanna say?

830
00:36:20,363 --> 00:36:21,283
I don't care.

831
00:36:21,283 --> 00:36:23,213
My mind is made up.

832
00:36:23,213 --> 00:36:26,293
- Oh, believe me, I'm not
trying to change your mind.

833
00:36:26,293 --> 00:36:28,293
You made your choice!

834
00:36:28,293 --> 00:36:30,010
- Good, so we are in agreeance, okay.

835
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:33,103
'Cause this relationship
has ran its course.

836
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:34,626
I want a divorce, Jackson.

837
00:36:47,753 --> 00:36:48,843
So what are you doing now?

838
00:36:48,843 --> 00:36:49,676
Where are you going?

839
00:36:49,676 --> 00:36:50,833
- I'm not leaving, but you are.

840
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,023
This my house.

841
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:53,263
You want to be with your lover,

842
00:36:53,263 --> 00:36:54,493
but think you're going
to be able to stay here

843
00:36:54,493 --> 00:36:55,603
until you decide to leave?

844
00:36:55,603 --> 00:36:57,783
- Look, I have no where to go right now.

845
00:36:57,783 --> 00:37:00,483
- Sounds like an issue for
the two of you to work out.

846
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,506
- Who's going to keep Courtney?

847
00:37:02,506 --> 00:37:04,403
- Oh, you never cared
about Courtney, no way.

848
00:37:04,403 --> 00:37:05,236
Don't worry about it.

849
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:06,069
- That's not true.

850
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:07,133
I kept her.

851
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:08,590
When you went to school, at work.

852
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,813
- Hmm hmm, and what does that mean?

853
00:37:10,813 --> 00:37:11,646
Nothing.

854
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,683
Look here, I want you to get your bags,

855
00:37:13,683 --> 00:37:15,703
pack all of your things and leave.

856
00:37:15,703 --> 00:37:17,413
We don't need you here.

857
00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:18,556
- That's fine, Jackson, okay.

858
00:37:18,556 --> 00:37:20,346
I'll leave.

859
00:37:20,346 --> 00:37:22,096
And you can have all of this stuff.

860
00:37:23,153 --> 00:37:26,153
There's nothing I want to
remember about this place, anyway.

861
00:37:28,343 --> 00:37:32,813
- Lynn, I've only loved, respected

862
00:37:32,813 --> 00:37:35,583
and treated you the way a woman should be.

863
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:39,926
Never, not once
disrespected you as my wife.

864
00:37:40,863 --> 00:37:43,773
I would have done anything
for you and Courtney

865
00:37:43,773 --> 00:37:46,293
because that's what a real man does.

866
00:37:46,293 --> 00:37:48,333
- Oh, a real man?

867
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,546
My new man is a real man.

868
00:37:50,546 --> 00:37:53,093
- Lynn, you need to get
the hell out of my house

869
00:37:53,093 --> 00:37:54,753
before I throw you out!

870
00:37:54,753 --> 00:37:56,263
You have five minutes

871
00:37:56,263 --> 00:37:58,783
before I help you get your
stuff and put it out myself.

872
00:37:58,783 --> 00:38:00,403
- All right, relax, already.

873
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,553
That's five minutes more than I need.

874
00:38:02,553 --> 00:38:03,386
- Get the hell out!

875
00:38:03,386 --> 00:38:04,953
- I don't want any of this stuff.

876
00:38:04,953 --> 00:38:05,813
Please.

877
00:38:05,813 --> 00:38:09,366
My man will make sure I have
everything I need, loser.

878
00:38:49,116 --> 00:38:50,765
- God, I've done all I can do.

879
00:38:55,343 --> 00:38:57,646
I tried to be a good father and a husband.

880
00:39:01,403 --> 00:39:03,356
How could you let this happen?

881
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,156
It's bad enough, my wife is cheating,

882
00:39:11,253 --> 00:39:13,952
but it's with someone that
claims to preach your ways.

883
00:39:18,383 --> 00:39:21,564
Doing things your way,
didn't work, it didn't work!

884
00:39:28,193 --> 00:39:29,440
So, you know what?

885
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:32,066
From now on,

886
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:35,206
I promise you,

887
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,130
I'm doing things my way.

888
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:40,579
Thanks for nothing!

889
00:39:58,233 --> 00:39:59,143
- Yes?

890
00:39:59,143 --> 00:40:00,893
- Hi, I'm here to see the reverend.

891
00:40:03,095 --> 00:40:05,406
- Hmph, he's with someone right now.

892
00:40:06,523 --> 00:40:08,283
- That's fine, I'll wait.

893
00:40:08,283 --> 00:40:10,583
I'm sure, he'll be glad
to know that I'm here.

894
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:13,213
- Okay.

895
00:40:13,213 --> 00:40:16,663
You can have a seat in the
sanctuary and I'll go get him.

896
00:40:16,663 --> 00:40:17,850
- Thank you.

897
00:40:31,373 --> 00:40:32,620
- What are you doing?

898
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,716
You can't just pop up like this.

899
00:40:35,703 --> 00:40:36,543
- Baby, I'm sorry.

900
00:40:36,543 --> 00:40:38,223
I just couldn't wait to see you.

901
00:40:38,223 --> 00:40:40,763
- That's what we need to talk about, too.

902
00:40:40,763 --> 00:40:41,600
- Talk about what?

903
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,433
- About me and you, us.

904
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:47,903
- That's why I came by. Look,
I told Jackson everything.

905
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,999
I told him I was leaving
him so we can be together.

906
00:40:50,999 --> 00:40:51,948
Now baby, we don't have to deal with this-

907
00:40:51,948 --> 00:40:54,313
- No, look, that's what I
need to talk to you about.

908
00:40:54,313 --> 00:40:55,813
We can't do this anymore.

909
00:40:55,813 --> 00:40:57,833
- What do you mean, anymore?

910
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:00,056
- I'm talking about, we need to stop, now.

911
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:03,261
- All right, baby,

912
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,663
please just tell her that you
playing with me, right now.

913
00:41:06,951 --> 00:41:08,826
- Look, we should have never
got involved in the beginning.

914
00:41:08,826 --> 00:41:11,063
I already got a deal with God about it.

915
00:41:11,063 --> 00:41:13,513
And I'm not leaving my wife for you.

916
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,053
- Don't do this.

917
00:41:15,053 --> 00:41:16,928
Please, don't do this.

918
00:41:16,928 --> 00:41:19,252
Come on, baby, why are you saying this?

919
00:41:19,252 --> 00:41:20,666
- And you really wanna know?

920
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:21,823
- Yes, why?
- Do you really wanna know?

921
00:41:21,823 --> 00:41:22,851
- Yes, I wanna know.

922
00:41:22,851 --> 00:41:23,684
What did I do?

923
00:41:23,684 --> 00:41:25,033
I'm sorry for popping up.

924
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:26,073
- That's not the reason.

925
00:41:26,073 --> 00:41:26,963
- Well, what is it?

926
00:41:26,963 --> 00:41:27,796
- The reason why we can't be together

927
00:41:27,796 --> 00:41:30,283
is because I don't love you

928
00:41:30,283 --> 00:41:32,063
and I'm not finna' be responsible

929
00:41:32,063 --> 00:41:34,006
for stealing another man's wife.

930
00:41:36,133 --> 00:41:38,143
- Oh, so you don't want to
steal another man's wife

931
00:41:38,143 --> 00:41:39,364
but you'll have sex with one?

932
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:41,713
-  Man, also, if
you cheated on your husband,

933
00:41:41,713 --> 00:41:44,543
I definitely know you'll
cheat on me or any other man.

934
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,943
- I would never cheat on
you because I love you.

935
00:41:51,032 --> 00:41:54,033
- So you're the woman that's
been messing with my husband?

936
00:41:54,033 --> 00:41:54,866
- Excuse me?

937
00:41:54,866 --> 00:41:57,143
- Don't play dumb with me, Lynn.

938
00:41:57,143 --> 00:41:58,633
I know exactly who you are

939
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:00,913
and what the two of you have been up to.

940
00:42:00,913 --> 00:42:02,566
My husband told me everything.

941
00:42:03,683 --> 00:42:05,193
- What is she talking about?

942
00:42:05,193 --> 00:42:07,543
- Look, I told my wife everything

943
00:42:07,543 --> 00:42:09,793
and we're gonna get some
marriage counseling.

944
00:42:13,146 --> 00:42:14,393
- I love you.

945
00:42:14,393 --> 00:42:16,203
- You don't love him.

946
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:17,493
You love the idea of him

947
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,653
and what you thought he could do for you.

948
00:42:19,653 --> 00:42:21,663
Just like you thought
you loved your husband

949
00:42:21,663 --> 00:42:24,013
because he was taking
over the family business.

950
00:42:25,073 --> 00:42:25,980
I know everything.

951
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,753
- But you don't know me, okay?

952
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,533
And you're wrong.

953
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:30,366
I love him.

954
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:33,843
- You don't even love yourself.

955
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,373
Look at you.

956
00:42:35,373 --> 00:42:38,393
You had a good man at home
and now you standing here,

957
00:42:38,393 --> 00:42:40,666
begging my husband to be with you.

958
00:42:44,013 --> 00:42:45,593
- So I was just a piece of ass?

959
00:42:45,593 --> 00:42:47,823
- Hey, you watch your
mouth in God's house.

960
00:42:47,823 --> 00:42:50,263
- Was it God's house when
you stood here, kissing me

961
00:42:50,263 --> 00:42:51,101
and caressing me?

962
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,503
- Look, look, now, I already
asked for forgiveness

963
00:42:53,503 --> 00:42:54,473
and I prayed about it.

964
00:42:54,473 --> 00:42:56,853
Me and my wife, we're gonna
get some marriage counseling.

965
00:42:56,853 --> 00:42:58,523
We're going to work on our marriage.

966
00:42:58,523 --> 00:42:59,993
And I suggest you do to same.

967
00:43:02,363 --> 00:43:03,276
- Just like that?

968
00:43:04,233 --> 00:43:05,323
It's over?

969
00:43:05,323 --> 00:43:08,836
- Lynn, go home and try
to fix your marriage.

970
00:43:09,863 --> 00:43:10,906
- Go home, Lynn.

971
00:43:13,693 --> 00:43:15,926
- So you were never
going to leave your wife?

972
00:43:16,973 --> 00:43:18,733
So, you lied to me.

973
00:43:18,733 --> 00:43:20,836
You misled me this entire time.

974
00:43:23,773 --> 00:43:25,070
I meant nothing to you?

975
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:31,143
You are nothing but a
johnny-come-lately preacher

976
00:43:31,143 --> 00:43:32,943
that was trying to get laid

977
00:43:33,873 --> 00:43:35,659
and I hope you rot in hell.

978
00:43:41,053 --> 00:43:43,479
- You got some explaining to do.

979
00:43:43,479 --> 00:43:44,529
- I'm so sorry, baby.

980
00:43:58,596 --> 00:44:01,713
- Son, you sitting here like
you done lost your best friend.

981
00:44:01,713 --> 00:44:02,756
What's going on?

982
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:06,573
- Lynn's having an affair.

983
00:44:06,573 --> 00:44:07,516
- An affair?

984
00:44:08,473 --> 00:44:09,673
Are you sure?

985
00:44:09,673 --> 00:44:11,683
- Yes, I'm very sure.

986
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:13,003
- And how do you know this?

987
00:44:13,003 --> 00:44:14,802
- Mama, I caught her red-handed.

988
00:44:14,802 --> 00:44:16,086
- What the hell!

989
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,543
Oh Lord, forgive me.

990
00:44:18,543 --> 00:44:20,863
I'm sorry, but that just burns my butt

991
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,063
when somebody mess over my baby.

992
00:44:23,063 --> 00:44:24,493
- Yeah, well, it's worse than that.

993
00:44:24,493 --> 00:44:26,593
- Now, how can it get any worse than that?

994
00:44:28,263 --> 00:44:30,093
You mean to tell me that you know the punk

995
00:44:30,093 --> 00:44:31,563
that's been sleeping with your wife?

996
00:44:31,563 --> 00:44:34,119
- Yes, I caught her in our bedroom.

997
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:34,952
- Who is it?

998
00:44:34,952 --> 00:44:36,183
- Reverend Smith.

999
00:44:36,183 --> 00:44:37,016
- Who?

1000
00:44:37,016 --> 00:44:39,050
- Mama, he was the same
preacher that married us.

1001
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,303
- Oh, the devil is a lie!

1002
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,753
- You know, your daddy
used to always tell me

1003
00:44:43,753 --> 00:44:45,493
that them preachers ain't no good,

1004
00:44:45,493 --> 00:44:47,313
that all they want is all your money

1005
00:44:47,313 --> 00:44:50,393
and to chase them no good
women all around the church.

1006
00:44:50,393 --> 00:44:52,543
And I used to tell him
that it wasn't true.

1007
00:44:53,713 --> 00:44:55,153
The truth of the matter is, baby,

1008
00:44:55,153 --> 00:44:58,213
it's happened more than
I can shake a stick at.

1009
00:44:58,213 --> 00:44:59,523
You do know why your daddy

1010
00:44:59,523 --> 00:45:01,843
stopped going to church a long time ago?

1011
00:45:01,843 --> 00:45:03,893
- Hmm hmm, and daddy was right.

1012
00:45:03,893 --> 00:45:05,773
And that's why I'm not stepping foot

1013
00:45:05,773 --> 00:45:07,268
in another church again.

1014
00:45:07,268 --> 00:45:08,973
- Nmm mmm, boy, now, you watch your mouth.

1015
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:11,113
You cannot lump all the other churches

1016
00:45:11,113 --> 00:45:13,253
and preachers into this.

1017
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:15,563
- Mama, I respect everything

1018
00:45:15,563 --> 00:45:17,843
you and dad taught me as a child,

1019
00:45:17,843 --> 00:45:22,723
but I'm not stepping foot
in another church, again.

1020
00:45:22,723 --> 00:45:24,243
Why would God allow this to happen?

1021
00:45:24,243 --> 00:45:25,076
Tell me that!

1022
00:45:25,076 --> 00:45:26,413
- Baby, I can't explain it.

1023
00:45:26,413 --> 00:45:30,563
But I do know that God did
not allow this to happen.

1024
00:45:30,563 --> 00:45:32,943
Lynn made a choice to cheat

1025
00:45:32,943 --> 00:45:34,636
and that's because she's a tramp.

1026
00:45:35,703 --> 00:45:38,336
And that man, well, he
need a good beating.

1027
00:45:40,801 --> 00:45:43,663
Baby, I know you're hurt.

1028
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,316
But please, don't turn your back on God.

1029
00:45:49,933 --> 00:45:51,720
I taught you better than that.

1030
00:45:52,803 --> 00:45:57,803
- Mama, I've been on my
knees every day, praying,

1031
00:45:58,273 --> 00:46:00,956
and asking God to fix my marriage.

1032
00:46:02,064 --> 00:46:03,964
And this is how he answers my prayers!

1033
00:46:07,862 --> 00:46:09,583
- Oh, Lord.

1034
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:13,836
Thomas, I know, I got to let
him go, but that's my baby.

1035
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,931
God, just take care of him.

1036
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:25,916
- Girl...

1037
00:46:26,883 --> 00:46:29,873
You are not going to believe
what this man did to me.

1038
00:46:29,873 --> 00:46:30,843
- What man?

1039
00:46:30,843 --> 00:46:31,676
Jackson?

1040
00:46:31,676 --> 00:46:35,963
- Nmm mmm, the reverend, Reverend Smith.

1041
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:37,993
- Oh him, what he do?

1042
00:46:37,993 --> 00:46:40,343
He finally told you he
was gonna leave his wife?

1043
00:46:40,343 --> 00:46:41,580
- Yeah, he told me that but then he-

1044
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,333
- And then what?

1045
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,433
- Then he said he wasn't leaving his wife.

1046
00:46:46,743 --> 00:46:47,980
- Now sis, you know, I love you.

1047
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:50,963
And I really hate to tell you this, but,

1048
00:46:50,963 --> 00:46:51,826
I told you that!

1049
00:46:52,783 --> 00:46:53,863
- Yeah, I know.

1050
00:46:53,863 --> 00:46:56,873
But this man told me, he loved me.

1051
00:46:56,873 --> 00:46:59,843
- Lynn, that man didn't love you.

1052
00:46:59,843 --> 00:47:01,543
He just loved that you wanted him!

1053
00:47:01,543 --> 00:47:03,843
- I really loved him.

1054
00:47:03,843 --> 00:47:06,993
- Girl, you did not love him.

1055
00:47:06,993 --> 00:47:08,513
You just loved what he was doing for you

1056
00:47:08,513 --> 00:47:11,063
that you thought you were
missing in your marriage.

1057
00:47:11,063 --> 00:47:12,606
That is not love.

1058
00:47:13,574 --> 00:47:15,843
- I know, but what am
I supposed to do now?

1059
00:47:15,843 --> 00:47:18,273
I mean, I treated Jackson terrible.

1060
00:47:18,273 --> 00:47:20,283
I can only imagine what
he thinks about me.

1061
00:47:20,283 --> 00:47:22,143
I'm sure he hates me.

1062
00:47:22,143 --> 00:47:25,173
- You need to go home
and fix your marriage.

1063
00:47:25,173 --> 00:47:27,633
- But do you think he'll forgive me?

1064
00:47:27,633 --> 00:47:30,576
- Chile, I don't know. But
that sounds like a conversation

1065
00:47:30,576 --> 00:47:32,766
you need to be having with your husband.

1066
00:47:34,723 --> 00:47:37,313
- Ah, yeah, mmm.

1067
00:47:38,463 --> 00:47:39,953
Thanks, sis.

1068
00:47:39,953 --> 00:47:42,930
You know, you always have
my back girl.

1069
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,084
- I know.

1070
00:47:44,084 --> 00:47:45,205
What would you do without me?

1071
00:47:45,205 --> 00:47:47,463
- I don't know.
- I always got your back.

1072
00:47:47,463 --> 00:47:49,553
Listen, and if we need
to go pull up on the Rev,

1073
00:47:49,553 --> 00:47:51,189
you know we can.

1074
00:47:51,189 --> 00:47:52,113
- All right, well, let's do it now.

1075
00:47:52,113 --> 00:47:53,626
I'm down.
- Let's go.

1076
00:47:55,177 --> 00:47:56,010
- You crazy.

1077
00:48:06,603 --> 00:48:07,533
- What are you doing here?

1078
00:48:07,533 --> 00:48:09,963
Did you come to get the
rest of your things?

1079
00:48:09,963 --> 00:48:11,961
- I was just wondering if we can talk?

1080
00:48:11,961 --> 00:48:14,391
- What is there to talk about?

1081
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,141
- Jackson, just let me come
in and talk to you, please.

1082
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,392
- Go ahead, you have five minutes.

1083
00:48:31,392 --> 00:48:34,213
- Listen, I made a huge mistake.

1084
00:48:34,213 --> 00:48:36,196
- What does that supposed to do for me?

1085
00:48:37,794 --> 00:48:39,473
- All right, I know you're upset

1086
00:48:39,473 --> 00:48:41,023
and you have every right to be.

1087
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,710
- Get to the point, Lynn.

1088
00:48:45,713 --> 00:48:47,663
- Jackson, I still love you.

1089
00:48:47,663 --> 00:48:49,636
And I want us to try and make it work.

1090
00:48:51,833 --> 00:48:55,373
- Tell the truth, he left you, didn't he?

1091
00:48:57,763 --> 00:49:00,733
- Yeah, he said he
wasn't leaving his wife.

1092
00:49:00,733 --> 00:49:01,593
You were right.

1093
00:49:01,593 --> 00:49:03,473
I should have listened to you.

1094
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:05,603
- Well, that's too late for that, now.

1095
00:49:05,603 --> 00:49:07,163
What'd you expect me to do?

1096
00:49:07,163 --> 00:49:08,176
Take you back?

1097
00:49:09,233 --> 00:49:11,703
- Yes or at least see me.

1098
00:49:11,703 --> 00:49:12,853
I mean, we can still talk.

1099
00:49:12,853 --> 00:49:14,483
We can hang out.

1100
00:49:14,483 --> 00:49:16,043
We can see each other.

1101
00:49:16,043 --> 00:49:17,246
- Are you kidding me?

1102
00:49:19,053 --> 00:49:21,423
- Listen, Jackson, I love you, all right.

1103
00:49:21,423 --> 00:49:23,773
I'm just not in love with you.

1104
00:49:23,773 --> 00:49:26,783
And I think it's best
that we remain friends.

1105
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,873
- Lynn, I put everything I had
in me into this relationship.

1106
00:49:29,873 --> 00:49:31,846
- I know, but it's better this way.

1107
00:49:34,744 --> 00:49:37,813
-  This is truly amazing.

1108
00:49:39,523 --> 00:49:42,336
You chose to be a mistress
instead of being a wife.

1109
00:49:43,243 --> 00:49:45,363
- Look, you're out of line, okay.

1110
00:49:45,363 --> 00:49:46,196
I'm not gonna stand here

1111
00:49:46,196 --> 00:49:48,513
and let you talk to me any kind of way.

1112
00:49:48,513 --> 00:49:51,213
- No, you're gonna stand
here and you're gonna listen.

1113
00:49:54,093 --> 00:49:56,286
So you like when man treat you like dirt.

1114
00:49:57,783 --> 00:50:00,493
You love to be the other
woman, you get off on that.

1115
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,336
You want the perks of being married,

1116
00:50:03,336 --> 00:50:05,853
but you don't want to do the work.

1117
00:50:05,853 --> 00:50:09,043
- All right, Mr. Husband of the Year,

1118
00:50:09,043 --> 00:50:11,031
Mr. Perfect Father.

1119
00:50:11,031 --> 00:50:13,863
You know, you're not the only
man in this world, right?

1120
00:50:13,863 --> 00:50:15,713
Yeah, you provided for me.

1121
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:17,936
Yeah, you were good to me.

1122
00:50:19,978 --> 00:50:22,026
But don't act like you deserve something.

1123
00:50:22,897 --> 00:50:27,593
-  Finally, the
real you is coming out.

1124
00:50:27,593 --> 00:50:29,603
- Look, I came by here so we can talk

1125
00:50:29,603 --> 00:50:32,113
and try to figure out a
way to move forward, okay?

1126
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:35,103
But all you want to do
is talk bad about me.

1127
00:50:35,103 --> 00:50:37,343
- No, you say you want a good man,

1128
00:50:37,343 --> 00:50:39,666
but every time you get one,
all you do is mess it up.

1129
00:50:39,666 --> 00:50:41,603
- All right, that's enough.

1130
00:50:41,603 --> 00:50:42,753
You've said that already.

1131
00:50:42,753 --> 00:50:44,983
- No, it's far from enough.

1132
00:50:44,983 --> 00:50:47,103
I never cheated on you

1133
00:50:47,103 --> 00:50:49,236
regardless of the countless opportunities.

1134
00:50:50,453 --> 00:50:54,226
And, as corny as this may sound,

1135
00:50:55,133 --> 00:50:57,603
I never even thought about it

1136
00:50:57,603 --> 00:50:59,873
because I only had thoughts of you.

1137
00:50:59,873 --> 00:51:01,516
You were my everything.

1138
00:51:02,543 --> 00:51:04,226
But you was too blind to see it.

1139
00:51:05,543 --> 00:51:07,363
- Jackson, I don't know what else to say,

1140
00:51:07,363 --> 00:51:09,066
but I'm sorry for hurting you.

1141
00:51:10,493 --> 00:51:12,713
- Just remember this.

1142
00:51:12,713 --> 00:51:15,933
You may meet men that
say they care about you.

1143
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:17,713
They may buy you gifts,

1144
00:51:17,713 --> 00:51:20,363
take you to fancy places, all of that.

1145
00:51:22,373 --> 00:51:23,826
But eventually,

1146
00:51:25,093 --> 00:51:28,293
they'll see past all the looks

1147
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:31,053
and realize you for who you really are.

1148
00:51:31,053 --> 00:51:34,103
- Jackson, that'll never happen.

1149
00:51:34,103 --> 00:51:36,003
- Oh, you think it can't happen to you?

1150
00:51:36,003 --> 00:51:37,773
- Nah, you see all of this.

1151
00:51:37,773 --> 00:51:38,676
I'm not worried.

1152
00:51:40,713 --> 00:51:42,583
- You know what?

1153
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:43,966
Your five minutes are up.

1154
00:51:46,933 --> 00:51:50,506
Unless you have something
else to get off your chest,

1155
00:51:51,393 --> 00:51:53,133
you can leave now.

1156
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:55,093
- You know this whole pipe dream

1157
00:51:55,093 --> 00:51:57,783
of you becoming the next Johnnie Cochran,

1158
00:51:57,783 --> 00:51:59,483
yeah, I doubt that's gonna happen.

1159
00:52:01,774 --> 00:52:03,493
And I was okay before you came.

1160
00:52:03,493 --> 00:52:05,836
So trust me, I'll be fine without you.

1161
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:09,708
- Be honest with yourself

1162
00:52:09,708 --> 00:52:11,173
and realize for a moment

1163
00:52:12,733 --> 00:52:15,336
that being with half a
man because of money,

1164
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:17,416
isn't true love.

1165
00:52:19,273 --> 00:52:21,036
And after all this, Lynn,

1166
00:52:22,183 --> 00:52:26,353
I still love you, but I
can't stand the sight of you.

1167
00:52:27,926 --> 00:52:29,726
- Hey, I can't say that I blame you.

1168
00:52:30,973 --> 00:52:33,526
I do hope that we can at
least be cordial one day.

1169
00:52:39,533 --> 00:52:41,146
Take care of yourself, Jackson.

1170
00:52:42,433 --> 00:52:43,733
Just know that I love you.

1171
00:52:44,653 --> 00:52:46,203
Tell Ms. Courtney, I said, bye.

1172
00:53:00,753 --> 00:53:03,513
- Jack, just left work.

1173
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,913
Liking that corner office, man.

1174
00:53:05,913 --> 00:53:06,746
How are you liking it?

1175
00:53:06,746 --> 00:53:08,806
- Yeah, it's okay, man.

1176
00:53:09,733 --> 00:53:11,359
I never thought I'd see that day,

1177
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,209
I'd have my own office in a law firm.

1178
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:16,643
And to make junior partner this fast?

1179
00:53:16,643 --> 00:53:18,263
Just the icing on the cake.

1180
00:53:18,263 --> 00:53:20,253
- I know how you feel.

1181
00:53:20,253 --> 00:53:23,863
Well, nah, not really.

1182
00:53:23,863 --> 00:53:25,703
You know, you being the Golden Child

1183
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,886
of the law firm and all.

1184
00:53:27,886 --> 00:53:29,426
- Yeah, it's been a long road.

1185
00:53:30,485 --> 00:53:32,863
A lot of ups and downs.

1186
00:53:32,863 --> 00:53:34,126
But do you believe this?

1187
00:53:35,354 --> 00:53:36,223
We made it, bro?

1188
00:53:36,223 --> 00:53:37,173
- We made it.

1189
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:39,413
Who'd thought, me and you?

1190
00:53:39,413 --> 00:53:40,773
Lawyers, right now.

1191
00:53:40,773 --> 00:53:41,606
- I know, right?

1192
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:45,433
So tell me about that nurse
you went out with last week.

1193
00:53:45,433 --> 00:53:47,263
Did she check your temperature, yet?

1194
00:53:47,263 --> 00:53:50,333
- Man, she checked my temperature,

1195
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:51,813
my blood pressure

1196
00:53:51,813 --> 00:53:54,423
and gave me a sponge bath.

1197
00:53:54,423 --> 00:53:55,983
- Boy, you know, you're wild.

1198
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:56,963
Do she have any friends?

1199
00:53:56,963 --> 00:53:59,363
- What, you want one like mine?

1200
00:53:59,363 --> 00:54:00,713
- What type would that be?

1201
00:54:00,713 --> 00:54:02,263
- No self-esteem.

1202
00:54:02,263 --> 00:54:03,960
Show 'em a little bit of attention

1203
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,433
and you all the way in.

1204
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:08,983
- Remember, I just asked
if she had any friends.

1205
00:54:08,983 --> 00:54:10,815
Nevermind, scratch that, bro.

1206
00:54:10,815 --> 00:54:11,648
I'm good.

1207
00:54:16,506 --> 00:54:17,593
- How you doing?
- Hey.

1208
00:54:17,593 --> 00:54:20,303
- I'll have a large coffee, black please.

1209
00:54:20,303 --> 00:54:22,893
- Okay and what can I get for your friend?

1210
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:25,233
- Oh, I'm not with him.

1211
00:54:25,233 --> 00:54:27,263
- I'm sorry, I just...

1212
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:29,932
It seemed like you two were here together.

1213
00:54:29,932 --> 00:54:31,513
- That's okay.
- That's okay.

1214
00:54:31,513 --> 00:54:34,623
- Add whatever she's having to my bill.

1215
00:54:34,623 --> 00:54:36,213
- Thank you, but I got it.

1216
00:54:37,513 --> 00:54:38,346
So matter of fact,

1217
00:54:38,346 --> 00:54:40,433
you can add whatever
he's having on to my tab.

1218
00:54:41,313 --> 00:54:44,014
- Okay, and that's your
usual order, right?

1219
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:46,783
- Yes, a large espresso, to go.

1220
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,583
- Gotcha, coming right up.

1221
00:54:50,475 --> 00:54:51,793
- Do you always turn a man down

1222
00:54:51,793 --> 00:54:53,623
when he tries to buy you coffee?

1223
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:54,556
- Only today.

1224
00:54:55,986 --> 00:54:57,286
I'm just kidding.

1225
00:54:58,183 --> 00:55:02,693
Never had anyone ask me before,
so, thank you very much.

1226
00:55:02,693 --> 00:55:04,243
- Well, don't say I didn't try.

1227
00:55:05,443 --> 00:55:07,359
I'm sorry, I didn't,

1228
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:08,563
what'd you say your name was again?

1229
00:55:08,563 --> 00:55:10,322
- You never asked me for my name.

1230
00:55:10,322 --> 00:55:12,266
- Ah, I'm Jackson Thomas.

1231
00:55:13,216 --> 00:55:14,323
And your name is?

1232
00:55:14,323 --> 00:55:16,023
- Well, hello, Mr. Jackson Thomas.

1233
00:55:17,273 --> 00:55:18,573
- I'm Shawn.

1234
00:55:18,573 --> 00:55:19,923
It's a pleasure to meet ya.

1235
00:55:21,173 --> 00:55:22,950
I've never seen you in here before.

1236
00:55:24,071 --> 00:55:25,293
- Pleasure's all mine.

1237
00:55:25,293 --> 00:55:28,103
And this is my first time coming here, so,

1238
00:55:28,103 --> 00:55:30,763
I'm sure that's the reason
you haven't seen me before.

1239
00:55:30,763 --> 00:55:32,793
- That would explain it 'cause I

1240
00:55:33,923 --> 00:55:36,643
definitely would have remembered if I had.

1241
00:55:36,643 --> 00:55:37,643
- Oh, is that right?

1242
00:55:38,713 --> 00:55:40,693
Well maybe I'll stop back in tomorrow

1243
00:55:40,693 --> 00:55:43,003
if you're gonna be here.

1244
00:55:43,003 --> 00:55:43,896
- Sounds good.

1245
00:55:44,743 --> 00:55:46,723
- Well, I better get going.

1246
00:55:46,723 --> 00:55:49,503
I have to get back to work,

1247
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:52,626
but I guess I'll be seeing you again soon?

1248
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:55,016
- Maybe.

1249
00:55:55,953 --> 00:55:57,523
Maybe not.

1250
00:55:57,523 --> 00:55:58,903
- Oh, believe me, I will.

1251
00:56:17,351 --> 00:56:18,623
- What's up, bruh?

1252
00:56:18,623 --> 00:56:20,030
- Dang, bro.

1253
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:21,915
I see, I'mma have to
start locking my door.

1254
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:23,916
-  man, look, Tracy told me

1255
00:56:23,916 --> 00:56:26,573
about that how new temp worker
back at the office, man.

1256
00:56:26,573 --> 00:56:27,933
You checked that out, yet?

1257
00:56:27,933 --> 00:56:29,633
- Yeah, man, I saw her,

1258
00:56:29,633 --> 00:56:31,363
kept right on the moving.

1259
00:56:31,363 --> 00:56:32,713
- You a trip, boy.

1260
00:56:32,713 --> 00:56:33,843
But look, you still trying to

1261
00:56:33,843 --> 00:56:36,163
check out that new spot
down there on third?

1262
00:56:36,163 --> 00:56:37,503
- Yeah, I'm with it.

1263
00:56:37,503 --> 00:56:38,336
- Cool, cool, man.

1264
00:56:38,336 --> 00:56:39,330
I'm gonna go call Tracy, man,

1265
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:40,263
and see if he wanna roll with us.

1266
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:42,267
- All right, cool.
- All right.

1267
00:56:42,267 --> 00:56:43,853
- Hey, hey, hey Brian.

1268
00:56:43,853 --> 00:56:45,982
Come here for a second, man.

1269
00:56:45,982 --> 00:56:46,815
Have a seat.

1270
00:56:48,047 --> 00:56:48,880
- What's up, man?

1271
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,193
Everything good?

1272
00:56:50,193 --> 00:56:52,773
- Yeah, yeah, everything's cool, man.

1273
00:56:52,773 --> 00:56:56,193
Other than, the weirdest thing
happened to me the other day.

1274
00:56:56,193 --> 00:56:57,723
- What happened?

1275
00:56:57,723 --> 00:56:58,813
- I stopped by the coffee shop

1276
00:56:58,813 --> 00:57:00,643
on my way to the house
the other day, right?

1277
00:57:00,643 --> 00:57:01,476
- Okay.

1278
00:57:02,613 --> 00:57:04,113
- I'm standing at the counter.

1279
00:57:05,103 --> 00:57:06,193
I place my order

1280
00:57:07,073 --> 00:57:08,093
and standing next to me

1281
00:57:08,093 --> 00:57:10,636
is the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen.

1282
00:57:11,644 --> 00:57:13,433
- So what you tripping for?

1283
00:57:13,433 --> 00:57:15,533
- Bruh, I ordered my coffee.

1284
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:16,983
Right?
- Hmm hmm.

1285
00:57:16,983 --> 00:57:18,563
- And the clerk assumed we were together.

1286
00:57:18,563 --> 00:57:20,243
So she asked what she was having.

1287
00:57:20,243 --> 00:57:21,843
- Hmm hmm.

1288
00:57:21,843 --> 00:57:24,243
- Bro, check this out.

1289
00:57:24,243 --> 00:57:26,743
Not only did she let her
know we weren't together,

1290
00:57:27,842 --> 00:57:31,153
but she offered to buy my coffee.

1291
00:57:31,153 --> 00:57:33,493
- But did you get her last name though?

1292
00:57:33,493 --> 00:57:35,013
- Man, what I need her last name for?

1293
00:57:35,013 --> 00:57:36,883
We talked all of three minutes.

1294
00:57:36,883 --> 00:57:39,633
- Bro, always get their last name.

1295
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:42,483
That way you can Google them
and see if they're crazy

1296
00:57:42,483 --> 00:57:45,785
or got all kind of crazy
baby daddies and stuff, man.

1297
00:57:45,785 --> 00:57:48,373
- Man, that's not even
a weird part though.

1298
00:57:48,373 --> 00:57:50,493
What's crazy is,

1299
00:57:50,493 --> 00:57:53,303
man, I've been thinking
about this woman all day.

1300
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,973
-  That's 'cause she fine, bro.

1301
00:57:54,973 --> 00:57:58,974
- Nah, man, it's much
bigger than the looks.

1302
00:57:58,974 --> 00:58:01,486
I can't really explain this.

1303
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,670
Something about her.

1304
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:05,520
- You should have asked her out, bro.

1305
00:58:06,613 --> 00:58:07,843
- I don't know, man.

1306
00:58:07,843 --> 00:58:09,513
I'm probably just tripping.

1307
00:58:09,513 --> 00:58:11,903
- Look, man, if it's something real, bro,

1308
00:58:11,903 --> 00:58:13,473
go back there tomorrow, man.

1309
00:58:13,473 --> 00:58:15,993
If she there, ask her out.

1310
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:18,346
You don't want to miss out on
something if it's real, man.

1311
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:21,616
I'mma call Tracy, man.

1312
00:58:21,616 --> 00:58:22,533
- No doubt.

1313
00:58:24,555 --> 00:58:25,555
Hmm.

1314
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,686
- Excuse me, I'm sorry.

1315
00:58:42,117 --> 00:58:43,267
- I've seen you before.

1316
00:58:45,683 --> 00:58:46,906
- Coffee shop, right?

1317
00:58:48,513 --> 00:58:53,473
- Um, Jack-
- Jackson, yes, yes.

1318
00:58:53,473 --> 00:58:54,666
Are you following me?

1319
00:58:55,773 --> 00:58:56,805
Oh, you know what?

1320
00:58:56,805 --> 00:58:58,364
That's right, I owe you
money for the coffee, right?

1321
00:58:58,364 --> 00:59:00,483
- Don't do that, you
know what, don't even,

1322
00:59:00,483 --> 00:59:04,423
don't even, don't try that.

1323
00:59:04,423 --> 00:59:07,090
- So tell me, how is it that
we both ended up at this spot

1324
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,133
at the same time?

1325
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:11,783
- Because I work inside of this building.

1326
00:59:11,783 --> 00:59:13,313
- Get out of here.

1327
00:59:13,313 --> 00:59:14,391
Are you serious?

1328
00:59:14,391 --> 00:59:15,453
- I'm very serious.

1329
00:59:15,453 --> 00:59:16,906
I work on the 15th floor.

1330
00:59:17,903 --> 00:59:19,683
The only office I know on the 15th floor

1331
00:59:19,683 --> 00:59:22,193
is Wright & Collins, which happens to be

1332
00:59:22,193 --> 00:59:24,246
the biggest law firm in the city.

1333
00:59:25,303 --> 00:59:26,136
- Bingo.

1334
00:59:27,413 --> 00:59:28,859
- You work there?

1335
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:30,213
- Yes, I work there.

1336
00:59:30,213 --> 00:59:31,213
You sound surprised.

1337
00:59:32,573 --> 00:59:36,443
- I didn't know any of us
worked for that law firm.

1338
00:59:36,443 --> 00:59:38,013
Are you the secretary?

1339
00:59:38,013 --> 00:59:40,623
- No, I'm not the secretary.

1340
00:59:40,623 --> 00:59:41,486
I have my own.

1341
00:59:42,923 --> 00:59:43,866
- I didn't mean to offend you.

1342
00:59:43,866 --> 00:59:46,076
It's just-
- That I'm black?

1343
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:48,176
That I'm a woman?

1344
00:59:49,133 --> 00:59:51,256
- Honestly, it's both.

1345
00:59:52,833 --> 00:59:56,063
- I guess being a single
African-American woman

1346
00:59:56,063 --> 00:59:58,513
lead defense attorney in
a high-profile law firm

1347
00:59:58,513 --> 01:00:00,086
would be shocking to most.

1348
01:00:03,044 --> 01:00:05,123
- I'm honestly impressed.

1349
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:06,823
- What, that I'm a lawyer?

1350
01:00:06,823 --> 01:00:08,268
Or that I'm single?

1351
01:00:08,268 --> 01:00:10,340
- Oh, you just gonna tell me,

1352
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,914
you just came right at
me with that one, huh?

1353
01:00:12,914 --> 01:00:14,333
Wow.
- I'm just playing.

1354
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:16,581
I'm just playing, so.

1355
01:00:16,581 --> 01:00:18,083
What are you doing here?

1356
01:00:18,083 --> 01:00:20,003
- I'm a lawyer, as well.

1357
01:00:20,003 --> 01:00:22,356
- Oh, both lawyers.

1358
01:00:23,523 --> 01:00:24,466
Drink coffee.

1359
01:00:26,377 --> 01:00:27,210
And single.

1360
01:00:28,469 --> 01:00:29,766
- Was that a pickup line, young lady?

1361
01:00:31,446 --> 01:00:32,693
- I'm just playing.

1362
01:00:32,693 --> 01:00:34,553
That is none of my business.

1363
01:00:34,553 --> 01:00:36,938
- Well, for the record, yes, I'm single.

1364
01:00:37,813 --> 01:00:39,453
- Listen, I don't wanna come off

1365
01:00:39,453 --> 01:00:42,163
as being too forward or anything but,

1366
01:00:42,163 --> 01:00:44,803
I know a nice cozy little restaurant

1367
01:00:44,803 --> 01:00:46,923
not too far away from here,

1368
01:00:46,923 --> 01:00:48,046
if you're not busy,

1369
01:00:48,995 --> 01:00:50,346
would you like to grab a bite to eat?

1370
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:53,133
- Maybe.

1371
01:00:53,133 --> 01:00:55,704
Yes, I'd love to.

1372
01:00:55,704 --> 01:00:58,076
- That way, we can get to know
each other a little better.

1373
01:00:58,076 --> 01:00:59,243
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1374
01:01:00,343 --> 01:01:01,176
After you.

1375
01:01:08,613 --> 01:01:10,633
- Hey baby,
girl. How was your day?

1376
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:13,113
- It was good, real good.

1377
01:01:13,113 --> 01:01:14,783
- You were out later than normal.

1378
01:01:14,783 --> 01:01:17,504
- Everything is fine, dad.

1379
01:01:17,504 --> 01:01:18,876
What you doing up so late?

1380
01:01:20,183 --> 01:01:21,783
- Prepared my lesson for Sunday.

1381
01:01:23,143 --> 01:01:25,673
Time of a pastor is never dull.

1382
01:01:25,673 --> 01:01:26,516
- This is true.

1383
01:01:27,683 --> 01:01:30,163
What is the lesson about this Sunday?

1384
01:01:30,163 --> 01:01:31,166
- Honesty,

1385
01:01:32,053 --> 01:01:34,343
love and trust.

1386
01:01:34,343 --> 01:01:39,046
- Hmm, that was one of
mom's favorite messages.

1387
01:01:40,173 --> 01:01:41,676
- Yeah, I really miss her.

1388
01:01:44,012 --> 01:01:44,845
But I'm grateful to God

1389
01:01:44,845 --> 01:01:46,893
for giving me such a wonderful daughter

1390
01:01:46,893 --> 01:01:49,113
who looks after her daddy.

1391
01:01:49,113 --> 01:01:50,213
- I know you miss mom.

1392
01:01:51,363 --> 01:01:52,196
I do, too.

1393
01:01:53,903 --> 01:01:58,103
But that's why I'm here to
make sure that you are okay.

1394
01:01:58,103 --> 01:01:58,936
- I am.

1395
01:01:58,936 --> 01:02:01,433
And I know, I didn't want you
to have to give up your place

1396
01:02:01,433 --> 01:02:03,269
to look after me.

1397
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:05,083
It's been two years.

1398
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:06,953
I want you to enjoy your life

1399
01:02:06,953 --> 01:02:09,043
and not have to worry about your dad.

1400
01:02:09,043 --> 01:02:11,663
- Daddy, when it's time for me to leave,

1401
01:02:11,663 --> 01:02:13,203
I'll let you know.

1402
01:02:13,203 --> 01:02:15,983
So quit trying to get
me up out of the house!

1403
01:02:15,983 --> 01:02:18,633
- Okay, baby, so what else is new?

1404
01:02:18,633 --> 01:02:21,606
- Well, I met a new guy.

1405
01:02:23,643 --> 01:02:24,653
His name is Jackson

1406
01:02:24,653 --> 01:02:27,866
and he works at a law firm
in the same building as mine.

1407
01:02:28,843 --> 01:02:30,003
- A lawyer?

1408
01:02:30,003 --> 01:02:31,146
That's nice.

1409
01:02:32,133 --> 01:02:33,743
- Now, what that's supposed to mean?

1410
01:02:33,743 --> 01:02:35,453
- Remember the last guy?

1411
01:02:35,453 --> 01:02:37,646
- I know, I know, but,

1412
01:02:38,943 --> 01:02:40,186
Jackson is different.

1413
01:02:41,163 --> 01:02:44,023
I can tell from today, he's a great guy.

1414
01:02:44,023 --> 01:02:45,483
- Whoa, slow down baby girl.

1415
01:02:45,483 --> 01:02:48,223
What you know about
this Jackson character?

1416
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:50,603
- I know we have a date tomorrow.

1417
01:02:50,603 --> 01:02:52,693
Going to a basketball game.

1418
01:02:52,693 --> 01:02:57,453
- Granted, basketball
game, dinner is nice.

1419
01:02:57,453 --> 01:02:59,903
Not enough to know if he goes to church

1420
01:02:59,903 --> 01:03:02,126
or if he loves the Lord.

1421
01:03:02,126 --> 01:03:04,683
- Daddy, that is not how
people typically meet.

1422
01:03:04,683 --> 01:03:06,113
Like, what am I supposed to say?

1423
01:03:06,113 --> 01:03:07,263
Hello there, good looking.

1424
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,276
My name is Shawn.

1425
01:03:08,276 --> 01:03:10,507
And do you love the Lord?

1426
01:03:10,507 --> 01:03:11,340
Like...

1427
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:12,403
- You don't have to downplay,

1428
01:03:12,403 --> 01:03:15,036
you're the daughter of a
man of God, for anybody.

1429
01:03:15,036 --> 01:03:16,666
- I know, daddy.

1430
01:03:17,633 --> 01:03:18,813
I'm about to go to bed.

1431
01:03:18,813 --> 01:03:23,813
It's been a very, very long day.

1432
01:03:23,813 --> 01:03:26,333
- Don't forget to say your prayers.

1433
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:28,703
- Daddy, I am 35 years old.

1434
01:03:28,703 --> 01:03:31,593
You don't have to remind
me of that every night.

1435
01:03:31,593 --> 01:03:32,746
Good night, I love you.

1436
01:03:34,123 --> 01:03:35,393
- Good night, baby girl.

1437
01:03:39,823 --> 01:03:42,576
- So do you take all your
dates to a basketball game?

1438
01:03:44,202 --> 01:03:46,274
- I haven't dated much recently.

1439
01:03:46,274 --> 01:03:47,357
- Me, either.

1440
01:03:48,286 --> 01:03:49,853
It's so hard to find a good guy

1441
01:03:49,853 --> 01:03:52,463
that just wants to know you

1442
01:03:52,463 --> 01:03:54,843
and not sleep with you, you know?

1443
01:03:54,843 --> 01:03:55,793
- Yeah, I feel you.

1444
01:03:57,143 --> 01:04:00,496
It's hard finding a woman that
wants a regular simple guy.

1445
01:04:01,499 --> 01:04:03,446
You know, most women want the athlete,

1446
01:04:04,323 --> 01:04:05,773
the celebrity,

1447
01:04:05,773 --> 01:04:08,822
you know, driving a fancy
car and a big house.

1448
01:04:08,822 --> 01:04:10,113
- Yeah.

1449
01:04:10,113 --> 01:04:13,016
I am not into none of
that superficial stuff.

1450
01:04:14,393 --> 01:04:17,699
- Like those two women sitting
court side at the game.

1451
01:04:17,699 --> 01:04:20,733
Do you honestly think they
were there to see the game

1452
01:04:20,733 --> 01:04:23,206
or there to pick them up a baller?

1453
01:04:24,633 --> 01:04:27,006
They probably couldn't even
tell you who was playing?

1454
01:04:28,343 --> 01:04:29,923
- Well, I don't know about them,

1455
01:04:29,923 --> 01:04:32,066
but I love the game.

1456
01:04:32,973 --> 01:04:34,253
- You love the game?

1457
01:04:34,253 --> 01:04:35,848
- I sure do.
- Really?

1458
01:04:35,848 --> 01:04:37,458
- Yes, really.

1459
01:04:37,458 --> 01:04:39,250
I grew up watching the game

1460
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,443
and I played at the high school.

1461
01:04:41,443 --> 01:04:43,262
- Were you any good, though?

1462
01:04:43,262 --> 01:04:45,853
- Man, I was better than good.

1463
01:04:45,853 --> 01:04:49,480
I was the starting point guard
on the championship team.

1464
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:51,273
- Okay, all right.

1465
01:04:51,273 --> 01:04:52,603
I see, I'mma have to check you out.

1466
01:04:52,603 --> 01:04:54,446
Get you out on the court
and see what you got.

1467
01:04:54,446 --> 01:04:57,063
- Boy, don't let these stilettos fool you.

1468
01:04:57,063 --> 01:04:58,723
I gets down on the court.

1469
01:04:58,723 --> 01:05:00,598
- Okay.
- And in the court.

1470
01:05:02,703 --> 01:05:04,363
- Look at you.

1471
01:05:04,363 --> 01:05:06,873
Well, you've just earned
yourself a basketball beat down,

1472
01:05:06,873 --> 01:05:07,706
pretty lady.

1473
01:05:07,706 --> 01:05:08,666
- Oh, did I?

1474
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:09,499
- Yes, you did.

1475
01:05:09,499 --> 01:05:10,905
-  Boy, look at this wrist.

1476
01:05:10,905 --> 01:05:11,738
You see this wrist?

1477
01:05:11,738 --> 01:05:14,013
- It'll be blocked, off into the stands.

1478
01:05:14,013 --> 01:05:15,543
- Oh, whatever, that's
what I'mma do to you.

1479
01:05:15,543 --> 01:05:18,837
Three pointers, all up
in your face.

1480
01:05:18,837 --> 01:05:20,853
-  This is so beautiful.

1481
01:05:20,853 --> 01:05:22,246
- It is.

1482
01:05:23,933 --> 01:05:26,083
- You might find this
hard to believe, but,

1483
01:05:27,454 --> 01:05:30,363
it's the best date I've
been on in a long time.

1484
01:05:30,363 --> 01:05:31,196
- Really?

1485
01:05:32,246 --> 01:05:35,813
A good man like you, having
a problem with the ladies?

1486
01:05:35,813 --> 01:05:37,910
- It's the women I've been meeting.

1487
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:40,613
And why are you asking
me all the questions?

1488
01:05:40,613 --> 01:05:42,273
Why are you single?

1489
01:05:42,273 --> 01:05:46,366
- Hmm, I guess the right man
just haven't caught me yet.

1490
01:05:48,293 --> 01:05:51,229
I mean, I'm not looking for a man, but,

1491
01:05:51,229 --> 01:05:53,236
I do expect for a man to find me.

1492
01:05:54,813 --> 01:05:57,890
- Well, that right man might
be right here in front of you.

1493
01:05:59,493 --> 01:06:00,326
- Maybe.

1494
01:06:04,513 --> 01:06:05,346
Mmm.

1495
01:06:07,253 --> 01:06:08,673
So...

1496
01:06:08,673 --> 01:06:11,053
So what do look for in a woman?

1497
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:14,166
- I like to look a woman in her eyes.

1498
01:06:15,387 --> 01:06:17,876
You can tell a lot
about her soul that way.

1499
01:06:19,703 --> 01:06:22,613
- Oh, I see you laying it on pretty thick.

1500
01:06:22,613 --> 01:06:23,446
- Hmm hmm.

1501
01:06:26,206 --> 01:06:29,090
- I also like a woman that
has drive and ambition,

1502
01:06:30,443 --> 01:06:31,983
a woman that knows who she is

1503
01:06:31,983 --> 01:06:36,366
and not concerned with the
material things in life.

1504
01:06:38,272 --> 01:06:39,439
- I like that.

1505
01:06:40,703 --> 01:06:41,613
Tell me more.

1506
01:06:43,683 --> 01:06:45,653
- I love a woman that doesn't run away

1507
01:06:45,653 --> 01:06:46,953
the first sign of trouble.

1508
01:06:49,163 --> 01:06:51,993
- Sounds like you experienced that.

1509
01:06:51,993 --> 01:06:54,293
- Oh, I'm definitely
speaking from experience.

1510
01:06:55,342 --> 01:06:56,910
- I can see it in your eyes.

1511
01:06:58,313 --> 01:06:59,256
I can feel it.

1512
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,723
I know those words came from a deep place.

1513
01:07:04,723 --> 01:07:05,556
- Is that right?

1514
01:07:06,885 --> 01:07:07,718
- Yeah.

1515
01:07:08,596 --> 01:07:13,266
Jackson, I feel a connection with you.

1516
01:07:15,096 --> 01:07:16,403
I just want you to know,

1517
01:07:16,403 --> 01:07:18,646
that you can be open with me.

1518
01:07:19,983 --> 01:07:22,663
- Yeah, I feel a connection with you, too.

1519
01:07:22,663 --> 01:07:24,313
And it scares the hell out of me.

1520
01:07:25,843 --> 01:07:28,926
I don't let too many people
into my personal space.

1521
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:33,396
You know, I don't share much
about my past with them.

1522
01:07:34,846 --> 01:07:36,610
But I feel like I can with you.

1523
01:07:38,301 --> 01:07:41,690
- Jackson, you can.

1524
01:07:44,263 --> 01:07:47,236
- I need to tell you something
before we go any further.

1525
01:07:48,163 --> 01:07:50,463
- Please do not tell
me that you're married.

1526
01:07:50,463 --> 01:07:53,003
- No, no, it's nothing like that.

1527
01:07:53,003 --> 01:07:54,293
- Gay?

1528
01:07:54,293 --> 01:07:56,123
- No, all right, look,

1529
01:07:56,123 --> 01:07:57,530
let me just tell you.

1530
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:58,863
- I'm listening.

1531
01:08:00,253 --> 01:08:02,573
- I have an eight-year-old daughter.

1532
01:08:02,573 --> 01:08:05,033
- That's it?

1533
01:08:05,033 --> 01:08:07,273
I am sure she is a beautiful little girl

1534
01:08:07,273 --> 01:08:09,226
and you are great father.

1535
01:08:10,673 --> 01:08:11,506
- Yeah.

1536
01:08:12,783 --> 01:08:15,363
I raised her after her mother died

1537
01:08:17,083 --> 01:08:21,905
and was a single dad for a long time.

1538
01:08:21,905 --> 01:08:23,223
- Hmm.

1539
01:08:23,223 --> 01:08:25,553
- Then I met the woman

1540
01:08:25,553 --> 01:08:28,643
that would eventually become my ex-wife.

1541
01:08:28,643 --> 01:08:30,602
- Oh, so you were married before?

1542
01:08:30,602 --> 01:08:31,870
Yes, I was.

1543
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:36,776
- You mind sharing what happened?

1544
01:08:37,823 --> 01:08:38,655
I mean, we don't have to talk about it.

1545
01:08:38,655 --> 01:08:40,512
We can talk about something else.

1546
01:08:40,512 --> 01:08:41,373
I understand.

1547
01:08:41,373 --> 01:08:42,436
- No, that's fine.

1548
01:08:45,272 --> 01:08:47,726
She cheated on me six
months into the marriage.

1549
01:08:53,633 --> 01:08:54,583
And...

1550
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,432
After that, I just promised myself,

1551
01:08:59,432 --> 01:09:03,356
I wouldn't allow myself to
fall in love ever again.

1552
01:09:05,093 --> 01:09:07,833
- Yeah, but, just because
one woman hurt you

1553
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:09,930
doesn't mean that all of them will.

1554
01:09:11,383 --> 01:09:13,030
- I left one thing out.

1555
01:09:19,033 --> 01:09:20,303
- What's that?

1556
01:09:20,303 --> 01:09:21,733
- It was with a preacher.

1557
01:09:22,936 --> 01:09:24,606
And not just any preacher,

1558
01:09:25,823 --> 01:09:27,866
but the one who married us.

1559
01:09:27,866 --> 01:09:28,699
- Oh.

1560
01:09:30,573 --> 01:09:31,663
Sorry, but,

1561
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:35,893
just seems like God knew you
deserved better than that.

1562
01:09:35,893 --> 01:09:37,343
- God?

1563
01:09:37,343 --> 01:09:38,176
Yeah, right.

1564
01:09:39,803 --> 01:09:42,003
It's the same God that
allowed it to happen.

1565
01:09:43,153 --> 01:09:45,723
- Okay, so I know you're hurt, but,

1566
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:50,583
let's not, you can't blame
God for what happened?

1567
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:51,616
- I don't blame God,

1568
01:09:52,623 --> 01:09:56,203
but I'm definitely not a fan
of his right now, for sure.

1569
01:09:56,203 --> 01:09:57,602
- And what's that suppose to mean?

1570
01:09:57,602 --> 01:09:59,063
- That I don't trust preachers,

1571
01:09:59,063 --> 01:10:01,786
pastors or anyone that's
associated with them.

1572
01:10:02,634 --> 01:10:03,467
- Hmm.

1573
01:10:07,153 --> 01:10:09,405
Jackson, I'm ready to go.

1574
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:10,706
- Why, is everything okay?

1575
01:10:12,367 --> 01:10:17,367
- Eh, um, just gotta get caught
up on some work, that's all.

1576
01:10:18,602 --> 01:10:20,153
- I definitely understand that.

1577
01:10:21,563 --> 01:10:22,396
Hey listen,

1578
01:10:24,413 --> 01:10:26,946
I'm glad I feel like I can trust you.

1579
01:10:28,796 --> 01:10:29,628
- You can.

1580
01:10:31,463 --> 01:10:33,711
- Come on, let's go.

1581
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:45,116
- Hey man, we ain't seen you
all month, bro, what's up, man?

1582
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:48,133
- I know, I work with you and
I don't even see you no more.

1583
01:10:48,133 --> 01:10:50,053
- Hey, it sound like somebody all booed up

1584
01:10:50,053 --> 01:10:51,503
and can't even call his boys.

1585
01:10:52,483 --> 01:10:53,682
- Man, it's not even like that.

1586
01:10:53,682 --> 01:10:54,859
- Yeah, all right, bro.

1587
01:10:54,859 --> 01:10:56,865
- I've just been a little
busy with Shawn, that's all.

1588
01:10:56,865 --> 01:10:58,003
- Shawn?

1589
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,143
She got that nose so wide open,

1590
01:11:00,143 --> 01:11:03,602
I can drop a tractor trailer
through that mug, B.

1591
01:11:03,602 --> 01:11:05,580
- Hey, bro, that girl do look good, bro.

1592
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:06,533
- Hmm hmm.

1593
01:11:06,533 --> 01:11:08,713
- Man, I don't know what it is.

1594
01:11:08,713 --> 01:11:11,993
But being with her, does something to me.

1595
01:11:11,993 --> 01:11:13,543
- I know what it is, B.

1596
01:11:13,543 --> 01:11:14,631
She got that.

1597
01:11:14,631 --> 01:11:16,813
♪ Ohh wee ♪

1598
01:11:16,813 --> 01:11:17,733
- Fool clowning.

1599
01:11:17,733 --> 01:11:19,645
- Man, Tracy, is that
all you think about, man?

1600
01:11:19,645 --> 01:11:20,583
♪ Uh ha ♪

1601
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:22,043
- Ain't no secret.

1602
01:11:22,043 --> 01:11:24,473
- Man, we haven't even
made it to that level.

1603
01:11:24,473 --> 01:11:26,463
- Tracy, man, it's a concept, bro.

1604
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,583
Maybe if you take the time out

1605
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:29,352
to get to know a woman like Jackson,

1606
01:11:29,352 --> 01:11:31,003
you might get a second date, bro.

1607
01:11:31,843 --> 01:11:32,676
- All I know is

1608
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,673
she makes me happy in a way I haven't felt

1609
01:11:35,673 --> 01:11:37,512
in a very long time.

1610
01:11:37,512 --> 01:11:39,483
- Hey, that's great, bro.

1611
01:11:39,483 --> 01:11:42,273
- Speaking of which,
she's swinging by later.

1612
01:11:42,273 --> 01:11:44,193
I'mma introduce her to Courtney.

1613
01:11:44,193 --> 01:11:46,262
- You 'finna introduce her to Courtney?

1614
01:11:46,262 --> 01:11:48,705
- Yeah, that's what he said, bro.

1615
01:11:48,705 --> 01:11:50,813
- Man, you must really like this girl.

1616
01:11:50,813 --> 01:11:54,405
- Like I say, it's not
something that I was expecting.

1617
01:11:56,199 --> 01:11:57,383
It just happened.

1618
01:11:57,383 --> 01:11:58,753
- Well, I'm proud of you, bro.

1619
01:11:58,753 --> 01:12:01,173
- Hey man, as long as it,

1620
01:12:01,173 --> 01:12:02,566
I'm proud of you, too.

1621
01:12:02,566 --> 01:12:04,943
- Man, I appreciate that, fellas.

1622
01:12:04,943 --> 01:12:06,943
But you know what I
like about her the most?

1623
01:12:06,943 --> 01:12:09,593
- What's that man?
- Man, that she's honest.

1624
01:12:09,593 --> 01:12:10,932
You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

1625
01:12:10,932 --> 01:12:12,262
- We can talk about everything.

1626
01:12:12,262 --> 01:12:15,679
Like, we talk about our past,

1627
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,366
our future, our goals.

1628
01:12:18,473 --> 01:12:20,063
Nothing's off limits.

1629
01:12:20,063 --> 01:12:22,352
- Hey, B, sound like we ain't go see Jack

1630
01:12:22,352 --> 01:12:23,744
for another two months, man.

1631
01:12:25,293 --> 01:12:26,795
- Man, it's gonna be like that?

1632
01:12:26,795 --> 01:12:28,266
- Hey, yo-
- I mean.

1633
01:12:28,266 --> 01:12:30,137
Just invite us to the wedding, man.

1634
01:12:32,283 --> 01:12:33,392
- It's all good.

1635
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:49,653
- Hey, I want you on your best behavior

1636
01:12:49,653 --> 01:12:51,173
when my friend gets here, now.

1637
01:12:51,173 --> 01:12:52,953
- Yeah, I know, I'm a good kid, dad.

1638
01:12:52,953 --> 01:12:53,786
- I know.

1639
01:12:54,753 --> 01:12:55,793
It's just, I'm a little nervous

1640
01:12:55,793 --> 01:12:57,843
about the two of you meeting.

1641
01:12:57,843 --> 01:12:59,363
- Why are you so nervous, dad?

1642
01:12:59,363 --> 01:13:01,776
- Because, you're my favorite girl.

1643
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:04,686
And I really hope that you like her.

1644
01:13:09,963 --> 01:13:12,176
The moment I've been waiting for.

1645
01:13:13,932 --> 01:13:16,486
Courtney, this is Ms. Shawn.

1646
01:13:17,713 --> 01:13:20,553
Shawn, this is my lovely
daughter, Courtney.

1647
01:13:20,553 --> 01:13:21,396
- Hey, Courtney.

1648
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:25,443
I've heard so many good
things about you, young lady.

1649
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:26,432
- Hi, Ms. Shawn.

1650
01:13:26,432 --> 01:13:28,723
- You could just call me, Shawn, sweetie.

1651
01:13:28,723 --> 01:13:30,223
- You can call her, Ms. Shawn.

1652
01:13:31,993 --> 01:13:35,483
- This is such a beautiful
sweater you have on.

1653
01:13:35,483 --> 01:13:37,333
- Thank you, my dad bought it for me.

1654
01:13:38,182 --> 01:13:40,546
- Well, your dad has good taste.

1655
01:13:43,343 --> 01:13:44,575
Mmm, this looks good.

1656
01:13:45,432 --> 01:13:47,233
- Yeah, my dad made spaghetti.

1657
01:13:47,233 --> 01:13:49,333
He's a great chef.

1658
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:50,203
- Did you help your dad?

1659
01:13:50,203 --> 01:13:52,493
- Just a little bit because he said

1660
01:13:52,493 --> 01:13:54,143
he wanted it to be great for you.

1661
01:13:55,053 --> 01:13:56,932
- Is that so?

1662
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:59,316
- Courtney, go wash
your hands, sweetheart.

1663
01:14:05,253 --> 01:14:08,386
- Jackson, she is adorable.

1664
01:14:09,512 --> 01:14:12,096
- Yeah, she's a pretty good kid.

1665
01:14:13,153 --> 01:14:15,503
- I can see where she gets her charm from.

1666
01:14:15,503 --> 01:14:17,383
- I wish I could take
all the credit for that.

1667
01:14:17,383 --> 01:14:21,006
But my mom, she helps me out a lot.

1668
01:14:22,053 --> 01:14:24,553
- Well, hopefully I'll get
to meet your mom, also.

1669
01:14:27,833 --> 01:14:31,466
- I think we'll let our guest say grace.

1670
01:14:35,432 --> 01:14:36,283
Let's hold hands.

1671
01:14:40,453 --> 01:14:43,203
- God, I thank you for this
food we're about to receive

1672
01:14:44,693 --> 01:14:48,120
and I thank you for this time
that we're spending together.

1673
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,986
And God, I ask that you
bless the three of us

1674
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:54,086
with more opportunities
to break bread together.

1675
01:14:55,193 --> 01:14:56,986
Amen.
- Amen!

1676
01:14:58,373 --> 01:14:59,206
- Let's dig in.

1677
01:15:02,593 --> 01:15:05,543
Courtney, it's time to call
it a night, sweetheart.

1678
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:08,512
- Oh dad, can I stay up
just a little while longer

1679
01:15:08,512 --> 01:15:09,682
with you and Ms. Shawn?

1680
01:15:09,682 --> 01:15:13,453
- No, it's already past your bedtime.

1681
01:15:13,453 --> 01:15:14,913
- Please?

1682
01:15:14,913 --> 01:15:15,923
- Come on, Jackson.

1683
01:15:15,923 --> 01:15:16,756
- See?

1684
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:25,107
- Okay, good night, dad.

1685
01:15:25,107 --> 01:15:26,401
Good night, Ms. Shawn.

1686
01:15:26,401 --> 01:15:27,516
- Good night, sweetheart.

1687
01:15:27,516 --> 01:15:29,393
- Good night, baby girl.

1688
01:15:29,393 --> 01:15:30,506
Daddy loves you.

1689
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:33,193
I said, daddy loves you.

1690
01:15:33,193 --> 01:15:34,677
- Love you, too!

1691
01:15:37,453 --> 01:15:39,963
- Somebody is mad at you.

1692
01:15:39,963 --> 01:15:42,977
- Oh, these kids are a mess.

1693
01:15:44,733 --> 01:15:45,833
I think she likes you.

1694
01:15:47,073 --> 01:15:48,373
- You think so?

1695
01:15:48,373 --> 01:15:50,506
- Yeah, I can tell.

1696
01:15:52,073 --> 01:15:54,940
- That's good,

1697
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:57,176
because I really like her dad.

1698
01:15:58,751 --> 01:16:00,351
- Her dad really likes you, too.

1699
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:04,313
- What are you going to
do about it, Mr. Jackson?

1700
01:16:04,313 --> 01:16:05,472
- This.

1701
01:16:13,651 --> 01:16:16,003
- You've been hanging out a lot lately.

1702
01:16:16,003 --> 01:16:18,673
- I know, been with Jackson.

1703
01:16:18,673 --> 01:16:19,703
- Jackson?

1704
01:16:19,703 --> 01:16:20,946
- Yeah, we been hanging.

1705
01:16:21,823 --> 01:16:24,432
I even met his daughter
a couple of days ago.

1706
01:16:24,432 --> 01:16:25,863
- How old is she again?

1707
01:16:25,863 --> 01:16:28,536
- Eight, she's such a lovely girl.

1708
01:16:29,423 --> 01:16:30,466
- I got an idea.

1709
01:16:31,873 --> 01:16:34,023
Why don't you invite them to service

1710
01:16:34,023 --> 01:16:36,723
and afterwards, they could
come here for dinner.

1711
01:16:36,723 --> 01:16:37,673
- I don't know, Dad.

1712
01:16:37,673 --> 01:16:39,533
Maybe, some other time.

1713
01:16:39,533 --> 01:16:41,193
- Some other time?

1714
01:16:41,193 --> 01:16:42,770
You all have been dating a while now.

1715
01:16:42,770 --> 01:16:44,473
You're always together.

1716
01:16:44,473 --> 01:16:46,083
You even met his daughter!

1717
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:48,343
- I know, but I just don't think

1718
01:16:48,343 --> 01:16:50,613
inviting them to church
is the right thing.

1719
01:16:50,613 --> 01:16:52,352
- Right thing?

1720
01:16:52,352 --> 01:16:54,523
Are you ashamed to be
the daughter of a pastor?

1721
01:16:54,523 --> 01:16:56,743
- Of course not, dad, it's just-

1722
01:16:56,743 --> 01:16:58,153
- Does he not believe in God?

1723
01:16:58,153 --> 01:17:02,413
- Yes, he just doesn't know
my father is a preacher.

1724
01:17:02,413 --> 01:17:03,863
- Sounds like you're ashamed.

1725
01:17:05,373 --> 01:17:07,682
- Dad, his ex wife cheated on him.

1726
01:17:07,682 --> 01:17:09,243
- What does that have to do with you?

1727
01:17:09,243 --> 01:17:11,932
- Everything, it was with a preacher.

1728
01:17:11,932 --> 01:17:13,277
- I can understand that,

1729
01:17:13,277 --> 01:17:15,073
but you don't have to
be somebody you're not

1730
01:17:15,073 --> 01:17:16,466
just to make him happy!

1731
01:17:17,523 --> 01:17:18,593
- I know, dad.

1732
01:17:18,593 --> 01:17:20,243
I'mma tell him.

1733
01:17:20,243 --> 01:17:21,075
I am.

1734
01:17:21,913 --> 01:17:23,566
I just need to figure out how.

1735
01:17:25,043 --> 01:17:26,543
- Do you think you love him?

1736
01:17:26,543 --> 01:17:27,956
- Yes, I do.

1737
01:17:28,868 --> 01:17:31,166
He's a good guy, a great father.

1738
01:17:32,432 --> 01:17:34,056
He actually reminds me of you.

1739
01:17:35,852 --> 01:17:38,173
- Well, if you love him, you'll tell him

1740
01:17:39,363 --> 01:17:41,243
and he'll understand

1741
01:17:41,243 --> 01:17:43,023
and everything you say,

1742
01:17:43,023 --> 01:17:45,356
he won't change nothing.

1743
01:17:46,423 --> 01:17:48,303
The last thing you want to do

1744
01:17:48,303 --> 01:17:51,146
is build a relationship on a lie.

1745
01:17:55,893 --> 01:17:56,743
- I'mma tell him.

1746
01:17:57,753 --> 01:18:00,643
I just need to do it on my own time.

1747
01:18:05,643 --> 01:18:07,193
- How was your day, today?

1748
01:18:07,193 --> 01:18:08,563
- It was great.

1749
01:18:08,563 --> 01:18:10,556
I won my third case in a row.

1750
01:18:11,843 --> 01:18:13,206
Now, I'm here with you.

1751
01:18:14,153 --> 01:18:16,743
Things couldn't be any better.

1752
01:18:16,743 --> 01:18:18,893
- Okay, that's what I'm talking about.

1753
01:18:18,893 --> 01:18:19,806
- And you're well on your way

1754
01:18:19,806 --> 01:18:23,173
to being the top lawyer in Atlanta.

1755
01:18:23,173 --> 01:18:24,743
- I mean, you know...

1756
01:18:24,743 --> 01:18:25,806
- Baby, I believe in you.

1757
01:18:25,806 --> 01:18:29,523
- You believing in me, that means a lot.

1758
01:18:29,523 --> 01:18:31,606
- Baby, the sky is the limit.

1759
01:18:32,613 --> 01:18:34,343
- Eh, you're not too
shabby, yourself, now.

1760
01:18:34,343 --> 01:18:36,032
I mean, don't act like that.

1761
01:18:36,032 --> 01:18:37,571
- What can I say, what can I say?

1762
01:18:40,385 --> 01:18:42,723
- That's not what we gonna do. 1842 You
know, I could see us being a power couple.

1763
01:18:42,723 --> 01:18:44,443
- Couple?

1764
01:18:44,443 --> 01:18:45,316
- Yes, a couple.

1765
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:48,283
Did I say something wrong?

1766
01:18:48,283 --> 01:18:51,745
- No, it just kind of caught
me off guard, that's all.

1767
01:18:52,852 --> 01:18:55,596
Was that your way of
asking me to be your woman?

1768
01:18:57,021 --> 01:18:59,441
- Shawn, you know, I
really care about you.

1769
01:18:59,441 --> 01:19:00,274
- Yeah.

1770
01:19:00,274 --> 01:19:02,743
- You're constantly on my mind.

1771
01:19:02,743 --> 01:19:05,693
I even find myself thinking
about you whenever we're apart.

1772
01:19:06,565 --> 01:19:08,526
- I'm so glad you said that 'cause,

1773
01:19:09,852 --> 01:19:12,016
I feel the same way about you.

1774
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:16,296
- Ew, that's a relief.

1775
01:19:17,703 --> 01:19:21,012
I was hoping that you didn't
want to be just friends.

1776
01:19:21,012 --> 01:19:26,012
-  I want way
more than just friends.

1777
01:19:28,223 --> 01:19:30,403
- I want to share something with you.

1778
01:19:30,403 --> 01:19:31,236
- What's that?

1779
01:19:31,236 --> 01:19:32,626
- I trust you with my heart.

1780
01:19:35,063 --> 01:19:38,253
- I don't, Jackson, I
don't know what to say.

1781
01:19:38,253 --> 01:19:39,356
- Just say,

1782
01:19:41,163 --> 01:19:42,580
that you love me.

1783
01:19:45,012 --> 01:19:46,703
- You love me?

1784
01:19:46,703 --> 01:19:47,536
- Yes.

1785
01:19:48,733 --> 01:19:49,866
Shawn, I love you.

1786
01:19:51,543 --> 01:19:52,263
- Wow.

1787
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,245
Jackson, I need to,

1788
01:19:57,423 --> 01:19:59,060
I need to tell you something.

1789
01:20:01,073 --> 01:20:02,443
- As long as it's not anything

1790
01:20:02,443 --> 01:20:05,913
that's going to mess up this
moment and this feeling.

1791
01:20:05,913 --> 01:20:07,880
Go right ahead, baby.

1792
01:20:12,932 --> 01:20:14,606
I just wanted you to know,

1793
01:20:16,243 --> 01:20:17,136
that um,

1794
01:20:19,233 --> 01:20:20,086
I love you, too.

1795
01:20:21,743 --> 01:20:25,133
- That's what I wanted to hear.

1796
01:20:25,133 --> 01:20:27,474
- Hey, cheers.
- Cheers.

1797
01:20:27,474 --> 01:20:29,245
- To us.
- To us.

1798
01:20:32,543 --> 01:20:34,053
- Hey Shawn, what's going on, family?

1799
01:20:34,053 --> 01:20:36,573
- All is well, all is well.

1800
01:20:36,573 --> 01:20:37,432
How you been?

1801
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:38,744
- I've been well.
- Good.

1802
01:20:38,744 --> 01:20:39,577
- I'm just pressing in there,

1803
01:20:39,577 --> 01:20:41,010
trying to keep it together, you know.

1804
01:20:41,010 --> 01:20:42,431
- I get it.
- Indeed.

1805
01:20:42,431 --> 01:20:43,264
- I get it.

1806
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:45,533
- Who's this little cutie
you got with you, today?

1807
01:20:45,533 --> 01:20:47,663
- This little princess is Courtney.

1808
01:20:47,663 --> 01:20:49,003
My boyfriend's daughter.

1809
01:20:49,003 --> 01:20:51,273
- Okay, well, hello, Courtney.

1810
01:20:51,273 --> 01:20:53,696
Welcome to the Listening Tree Bookstore.

1811
01:20:55,102 --> 01:20:56,193
How old are you?

1812
01:20:56,193 --> 01:20:58,753
- I'm eight.
- Eight years old.

1813
01:20:58,753 --> 01:21:02,343
And we got a lot of good stuff
for eight year olds, okay.

1814
01:21:02,343 --> 01:21:04,336
Are you looking for
anything in particular?

1815
01:21:05,523 --> 01:21:06,723
- Nothing in particular.

1816
01:21:07,602 --> 01:21:08,883
Today is our girls' day,

1817
01:21:08,883 --> 01:21:11,262
so we decided to come and get some books

1818
01:21:11,262 --> 01:21:13,773
and go and get some ice cream.

1819
01:21:13,773 --> 01:21:16,025
- Girl's date, ice cream.
- Yes.

1820
01:21:16,025 --> 01:21:17,913
- You excited?
- Yeah.

1821
01:21:17,913 --> 01:21:18,745
- All right, well listen,

1822
01:21:18,745 --> 01:21:21,273
let's get excited about
some books first, all right.

1823
01:21:21,273 --> 01:21:23,173
Look, check these out.

1824
01:21:23,173 --> 01:21:24,873
Got a few recommendations for you.

1825
01:21:27,473 --> 01:21:29,035
Check those out.
- All right.

1826
01:21:29,035 --> 01:21:31,435
- If you need anything,
let me, and you know what?

1827
01:21:31,435 --> 01:21:32,268
How about this?

1828
01:21:33,383 --> 01:21:36,233
This one's especially for you, all right?

1829
01:21:36,233 --> 01:21:38,182
If you guys need anything, let me know.

1830
01:21:38,182 --> 01:21:39,323
- Sure will, thank you.

1831
01:21:39,323 --> 01:21:40,423
- All right, I'm here.

1832
01:21:43,113 --> 01:21:46,053
- I'm so glad my dad let me
spend time with you today,

1833
01:21:46,053 --> 01:21:48,188
Ms. Shawn.
- Me too, sweetie.

1834
01:21:54,583 --> 01:21:57,483
- Girl, why are you dragging
me to a bookstore in the rain?

1835
01:21:57,483 --> 01:21:58,602
- Only going to be here five minutes.

1836
01:21:58,602 --> 01:22:01,102
I've just got to grab
this book for my niece.

1837
01:22:01,102 --> 01:22:02,693
- It better be five minutes.

1838
01:22:02,693 --> 01:22:05,846
- Lynn, isn't that Courtney over there?

1839
01:22:07,001 --> 01:22:07,863
- That sure is.

1840
01:22:07,863 --> 01:22:10,053
I wonder what she's doing here?

1841
01:22:10,053 --> 01:22:11,610
- Let's go see.

1842
01:22:16,245 --> 01:22:18,363
- Hey, boy!
- Oh, hey, mama.

1843
01:22:18,363 --> 01:22:19,963
- Where that grand baby of mine?

1844
01:22:19,963 --> 01:22:21,283
I bought her some clothes.

1845
01:22:21,283 --> 01:22:22,423
- Oh, she's out with Shawn.

1846
01:22:22,423 --> 01:22:23,676
I thought you were them.

1847
01:22:23,676 --> 01:22:25,352
- Oh, well it's safe to assume

1848
01:22:25,352 --> 01:22:27,343
that y'all are more than just friends now.

1849
01:22:27,343 --> 01:22:29,618
- Yeah, mama, we're
more than just friends.

1850
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:31,873
- I really care about it, too.
- Hmm.

1851
01:22:31,873 --> 01:22:33,793
- And I know she cares a lot about me.

1852
01:22:33,793 --> 01:22:35,012
- Well, what about Courtney?

1853
01:22:35,012 --> 01:22:36,243
- Oh my gosh.

1854
01:22:36,243 --> 01:22:37,873
Courtney loves her to death.

1855
01:22:37,873 --> 01:22:39,953
- Oh, well, then that's
all that matters, baby.

1856
01:22:39,953 --> 01:22:41,762
I'm so happy for you, son.

1857
01:22:41,762 --> 01:22:44,557
Lord knows, she shole is better
than that last one you had.

1858
01:22:45,713 --> 01:22:47,633
- Thanks, mama.
- All right, baby.

1859
01:22:48,573 --> 01:22:49,673
- All right.

1860
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:51,176
- All right, tell Courtney to call me.

1861
01:22:51,176 --> 01:22:53,053
- I'll have her call you, you be safe.

1862
01:22:53,053 --> 01:22:53,886
- I will.

1863
01:22:55,913 --> 01:22:57,262
- Well hello, Ms. Courtney.

1864
01:22:58,813 --> 01:23:00,123
Hey, it's me, Lynn.

1865
01:23:00,123 --> 01:23:01,413
- I know who you are.

1866
01:23:01,413 --> 01:23:03,405
- Okay, well, how are you?

1867
01:23:04,955 --> 01:23:07,521
Haven't seen you in such a long time.

1868
01:23:07,521 --> 01:23:09,376
And look at you, growing up so fast.

1869
01:23:10,743 --> 01:23:12,102
How is your dad?

1870
01:23:12,102 --> 01:23:15,173
- Her dad is doing just fine.

1871
01:23:15,173 --> 01:23:16,006
Thank you.

1872
01:23:18,613 --> 01:23:19,923
- So, your dad sent you here?

1873
01:23:19,923 --> 01:23:22,073
- No, her dad did not send her here.

1874
01:23:22,073 --> 01:23:23,703
She's here with me.

1875
01:23:23,703 --> 01:23:24,536
- I'm Shawn.

1876
01:23:25,653 --> 01:23:26,586
- Oh, okay.

1877
01:23:27,873 --> 01:23:29,083
- So, you probably don't know who I am.

1878
01:23:29,083 --> 01:23:31,203
- Oh, I know exactly who you are.

1879
01:23:31,203 --> 01:23:35,563
Lynn, the ex-wife of
my boyfriend, Jackson.

1880
01:23:35,563 --> 01:23:38,623
- Ladies, is everything okay?

1881
01:23:38,623 --> 01:23:40,383
- Oh, we're fine.
- Cool.

1882
01:23:40,383 --> 01:23:42,383
Well, if you need me, let me know, okay?

1883
01:23:43,983 --> 01:23:45,286
- So you do know who I am?

1884
01:23:47,723 --> 01:23:51,296
Courtney, please be sure and
tell your dad, I said, hi.

1885
01:23:52,173 --> 01:23:54,573
- Oh, we'll make sure to
tell hi, you said, hey.

1886
01:23:56,762 --> 01:23:57,863
- You ready, Courtney?

1887
01:23:59,023 --> 01:24:00,936
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- Let's go.

1888
01:24:07,855 --> 01:24:10,495
- Hmm, I don't know what he sees in her.

1889
01:24:13,313 --> 01:24:15,443
- Well, somebody's a little jealous.

1890
01:24:15,443 --> 01:24:17,993
- Oh please, if I want him,
I'll get them back now.

1891
01:24:18,932 --> 01:24:22,003
Plus, I hear he's this
big time lawyer now.

1892
01:24:22,003 --> 01:24:24,816
Oh yeah, I may have to get my man back.

1893
01:24:25,953 --> 01:24:26,923
- Good luck with that girl,

1894
01:24:26,923 --> 01:24:29,530
'cause ole girl and Courtney looked like

1895
01:24:29,530 --> 01:24:31,135
they was kind of happy together.

1896
01:24:31,135 --> 01:24:32,936
- Oh, I don't care what they look like.

1897
01:24:33,967 --> 01:24:35,143
Yeah, I'mma go by there and get him back.

1898
01:24:38,627 --> 01:24:39,809
- All right, sis.

1899
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:55,093
- Well hello there, Mr. Thomas.

1900
01:24:55,093 --> 01:24:56,293
Oh, you're looking good.

1901
01:24:58,053 --> 01:25:00,039
- What are you doing here?

1902
01:25:00,039 --> 01:25:01,620
- Can I get a hug?

1903
01:25:01,620 --> 01:25:03,453
- Can I help you with something?

1904
01:25:03,453 --> 01:25:05,816
- Oh, I can't come in, okay?
- No.

1905
01:25:07,133 --> 01:25:09,102
- Look, I know you're busy.

1906
01:25:09,102 --> 01:25:10,333
You're probably working right now,

1907
01:25:10,333 --> 01:25:13,743
but you don't have to
be so formal with me.

1908
01:25:13,743 --> 01:25:14,793
It's me.

1909
01:25:14,793 --> 01:25:17,186
- Look, I'm very busy
with a case right now.

1910
01:25:18,443 --> 01:25:21,336
- Listen baby, I want you back.

1911
01:25:22,783 --> 01:25:24,432
I miss you.

1912
01:25:24,432 --> 01:25:26,303
I miss us.

1913
01:25:26,303 --> 01:25:27,643
I want my family back.

1914
01:25:27,643 --> 01:25:28,932
- What family?

1915
01:25:28,932 --> 01:25:30,653
- You and me and Courtney.

1916
01:25:30,653 --> 01:25:31,836
- Are you serious?

1917
01:25:32,733 --> 01:25:34,182
Okay, where are the
cameras that you brought?

1918
01:25:34,182 --> 01:25:36,623
Because I must be getting punked.

1919
01:25:36,623 --> 01:25:39,123
- Listen, I've given this a lot of thought

1920
01:25:39,123 --> 01:25:41,753
and I think that we
deserve a second chance.

1921
01:25:41,753 --> 01:25:45,378
- Do you not remember a certain
preacher that you screwed?

1922
01:25:45,378 --> 01:25:47,023
Hmm?

1923
01:25:47,023 --> 01:25:49,086
- Baby, that was in the past, okay.

1924
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,703
I know I made a huge mistake

1925
01:25:51,703 --> 01:25:54,045
and I've learned from it, trust me.

1926
01:25:54,045 --> 01:25:56,083
I don't want the lifestyle.

1927
01:25:56,083 --> 01:25:56,916
I want you.

1928
01:25:58,443 --> 01:26:01,323
- Well, you should've thought
about this when you had me.

1929
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:03,443
Now, I'm supposed to welcome
you back into our lives?

1930
01:26:03,443 --> 01:26:04,753
Are you crazy?

1931
01:26:04,753 --> 01:26:07,113
- No, I don't expect that right now.

1932
01:26:07,113 --> 01:26:09,866
I just want you to tell me
that you'll consider us.

1933
01:26:11,403 --> 01:26:13,323
- Lynn, I'm moved on

1934
01:26:14,223 --> 01:26:15,120
and I'm happy.

1935
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,626
- Are you really, Jackson?

1936
01:26:17,593 --> 01:26:19,193
Because I bumped into
your little girlfriend

1937
01:26:19,193 --> 01:26:20,166
at the bookstore.

1938
01:26:21,033 --> 01:26:22,352
She is not your type.

1939
01:26:22,352 --> 01:26:24,348
- And what type would that be?

1940
01:26:24,348 --> 01:26:26,693
- Baby, come on now, look at me.

1941
01:26:26,693 --> 01:26:27,646
She is not me.

1942
01:26:28,678 --> 01:26:30,102
- You're right.

1943
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:30,966
She's not you.

1944
01:26:32,193 --> 01:26:34,012
She's honest.

1945
01:26:34,012 --> 01:26:35,579
Trustworthy.

1946
01:26:35,579 --> 01:26:37,878
And that's more than I
can ever say about you.

1947
01:26:39,709 --> 01:26:43,762
- Listen, just think how
well we will be together now.

1948
01:26:43,762 --> 01:26:45,250
I mean, word on the street is,

1949
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:48,762
you stopped renting,
you bought this house,

1950
01:26:48,762 --> 01:26:49,813
you made partner.

1951
01:26:50,963 --> 01:26:52,586
- Oh, I see what this is about.

1952
01:26:54,602 --> 01:26:56,023
I get it.

1953
01:26:56,023 --> 01:26:57,583
See, when I was working
that late night job

1954
01:26:57,583 --> 01:26:59,133
and going to school,

1955
01:26:59,133 --> 01:27:00,913
it wasn't enough for you.

1956
01:27:00,913 --> 01:27:03,293
- That's not it.
- Yeah, it is.

1957
01:27:03,293 --> 01:27:05,343
You thought I wasn't going to be nothing,

1958
01:27:06,602 --> 01:27:08,420
but now you think I'm this hot shot lawyer

1959
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:10,510
and you want to walk right back into me

1960
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:12,286
and my daughter's life.

1961
01:27:12,286 --> 01:27:13,919
- That's not it.
- Yes, it is.

1962
01:27:13,919 --> 01:27:17,233
- Baby, that's not it.
- That's exactly what it is!

1963
01:27:17,233 --> 01:27:18,606
Unfortunately, for you,

1964
01:27:19,557 --> 01:27:20,708
that will never happen.

1965
01:27:22,283 --> 01:27:23,946
So thanks for stopping by, Lynn.

1966
01:27:24,972 --> 01:27:26,994
I'mma have to ask you to leave my home.

1967
01:27:26,994 --> 01:27:28,848
- Don't do this.

1968
01:27:28,848 --> 01:27:30,323
Don't do this, you're not gonna do this.

1969
01:27:30,323 --> 01:27:31,453
- Have a great life, Lynn.

1970
01:27:31,453 --> 01:27:32,445
- Come on, baby-

1971
01:27:36,577 --> 01:27:40,343
- Babe, that workout was so intense.

1972
01:27:40,343 --> 01:27:43,993
I have never ran so many miles in my life.

1973
01:27:43,993 --> 01:27:46,323
-  I know, I'm so sore.

1974
01:27:46,323 --> 01:27:47,636
- I'm all sweaty.

1975
01:27:48,803 --> 01:27:49,636
- I see.

1976
01:27:50,682 --> 01:27:51,613
Maybe I should help you

1977
01:27:51,613 --> 01:27:54,655
get out of those wet, sweaty clothes.

1978
01:27:55,793 --> 01:27:59,476
- Jackson, you are a complete mess.

1979
01:28:02,083 --> 01:28:02,916
- I'm so tired.

1980
01:28:04,365 --> 01:28:05,782
- I am exhausted.

1981
01:28:06,943 --> 01:28:10,356
- Oh, you won't believe
who popped up today.

1982
01:28:10,356 --> 01:28:11,243
- Who?

1983
01:28:11,243 --> 01:28:12,163
- My ex-wife, Lynn.

1984
01:28:12,163 --> 01:28:13,416
- And what she want?

1985
01:28:14,453 --> 01:28:18,477
- Some nonsense about wanting
us to be a family again.

1986
01:28:18,477 --> 01:28:22,253
-  That don't surprise me at all.

1987
01:28:22,253 --> 01:28:25,053
Me and Courtney seen her at
the bookstore the other day.

1988
01:28:26,073 --> 01:28:27,463
- Why would that make her

1989
01:28:27,463 --> 01:28:29,815
want to pay a visit back here though?

1990
01:28:29,815 --> 01:28:31,793
- Ah, you're not a woman,

1991
01:28:31,793 --> 01:28:34,075
so I don't expect for you to get it.

1992
01:28:35,163 --> 01:28:38,053
Okay, so here it is.

1993
01:28:38,053 --> 01:28:39,446
The ex bumps into the new woman,

1994
01:28:39,446 --> 01:28:42,006
with her ex-husband's daughter, right?

1995
01:28:43,682 --> 01:28:44,516
- Okay.

1996
01:28:46,293 --> 01:28:50,273
- Jackson, a woman can have a good man,

1997
01:28:50,273 --> 01:28:53,773
a good thing going, mess
it up and be fine with it.

1998
01:28:53,773 --> 01:28:55,943
But as soon as he decides to move on,

1999
01:28:55,943 --> 01:28:58,646
all of a sudden, she wanna
go back down memory lane.

2000
01:29:00,257 --> 01:29:01,550
- Hmm hmm.

2001
01:29:02,713 --> 01:29:04,773
The vapors.
- The vapors.

2002
01:29:04,773 --> 01:29:05,606
- Got it.

2003
01:29:07,762 --> 01:29:09,783
Well, she definitely
won't be back around here.

2004
01:29:09,783 --> 01:29:12,740
- And how are you so sure about that?

2005
01:29:12,740 --> 01:29:15,889
- Because I told her that I'm happy.

2006
01:29:15,889 --> 01:29:16,722
- Hmm hmm.

2007
01:29:16,722 --> 01:29:18,283
- And that you are exactly

2008
01:29:18,283 --> 01:29:20,249
what Courtney and I needed in our lives.

2009
01:29:20,249 --> 01:29:21,082
- Hmm hmm.

2010
01:29:21,082 --> 01:29:22,953
- And that we love you.

2011
01:29:22,953 --> 01:29:23,786
- Hmm.

2012
01:29:23,786 --> 01:29:27,544
- So you don't have
anything to worry about.

2013
01:29:27,544 --> 01:29:29,723
- No, I'm not worried.

2014
01:29:29,723 --> 01:29:31,413
- Well, that's good to know.

2015
01:29:31,413 --> 01:29:33,262
- But I am tired,

2016
01:29:33,262 --> 01:29:35,523
so I'mma go and take a shower.

2017
01:29:35,523 --> 01:29:37,352
- Do you want me to join you?

2018
01:29:37,352 --> 01:29:39,400
- Enter at your own risk.

2019
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,705
- I'll see you in there.

2020
01:29:46,196 --> 01:29:48,279
- Mm, that feels so good.

2021
01:29:49,422 --> 01:29:51,850
- How good does it feel?

2022
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:56,795
- So good, that, I don't want you to stop,

2023
01:29:56,795 --> 01:29:58,128
at just my legs.

2024
01:29:59,343 --> 01:30:02,243
- I don't wanna stop either.

2025
01:30:02,243 --> 01:30:04,443
- It's gonna be much
harder after you leave.

2026
01:30:06,313 --> 01:30:08,163
- Who said anything about me leaving?

2027
01:30:09,203 --> 01:30:10,903
Courtney is at your mama's, right?

2028
01:30:12,012 --> 01:30:14,126
- Yes, until tomorrow.

2029
01:30:14,126 --> 01:30:15,676
- Then you don't have to stop.

2030
01:30:17,773 --> 01:30:19,516
You do love me, right?

2031
01:30:20,360 --> 01:30:22,691
- Baby, I'm in love with you.

2032
01:30:22,691 --> 01:30:25,024

There we go.

2042
01:31:16,193 --> 01:31:17,593
Good morning, beautiful.

2043
01:31:17,593 --> 01:31:19,126
- Good morning, handsome.

2044
01:31:20,193 --> 01:31:21,463
What you over here doing?

2045
01:31:21,463 --> 01:31:24,823
- Making you a nice, healthy smoothie.

2046
01:31:24,823 --> 01:31:28,421
- Oh, well, aren't you special?

2047
01:31:29,953 --> 01:31:32,200
- Try it out and let
me know what you think.

2048
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,852
- Let me see what you're working with.

2049
01:31:39,997 --> 01:31:42,474
- Hmm, that's pretty good.

2050
01:31:45,503 --> 01:31:46,926
After last night, baby,

2051
01:31:48,553 --> 01:31:49,386
you deserve it.

2052
01:31:50,583 --> 01:31:52,223
- Wait, what are you talking about?

2053
01:31:52,223 --> 01:31:54,063
We didn't go all the way.

2054
01:31:54,063 --> 01:31:55,727
- We didn't?

2055
01:31:57,723 --> 01:31:58,775
- I know, I'm just playing.

2056
01:31:58,775 --> 01:31:59,995
- You know what?

2057
01:31:59,995 --> 01:32:00,944
You play too much.

2058
01:32:03,163 --> 01:32:04,606
- Baby, I gotta tell you.

2059
01:32:05,913 --> 01:32:08,836
What we shared last night was incredible.

2060
01:32:10,793 --> 01:32:11,905
I mean, I never,

2061
01:32:13,213 --> 01:32:15,226
held any woman all night.

2062
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,383
- Never?

2063
01:32:17,383 --> 01:32:18,216
- Never.

2064
01:32:21,123 --> 01:32:23,350
- Jackson, do you know I've
dreamed of having a man

2065
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:24,966
feel this way about me?

2066
01:32:30,445 --> 01:32:32,063
I need to tell you something.

2067
01:32:32,063 --> 01:32:34,073
- Oh, baby, look at the time, I gotta go.

2068
01:32:34,073 --> 01:32:35,762
I'm running behind.
- It'll only take a second.

2069
01:32:35,762 --> 01:32:37,328
- It's gonna have to wait.
- Just a minute.

2070
01:32:37,328 --> 01:32:38,762
- We'll talk about it later on.

2071
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:40,866
I promise, we'll talk about it later on.

2072
01:32:43,966 --> 01:32:45,423
- I guess, it can wait.

2073
01:33:18,734 --> 01:33:20,483
- It's good to see you again, Ms. Ray.

2074
01:33:20,483 --> 01:33:22,762
- Good to see you, too, Mr. Thomas.

2075
01:33:22,762 --> 01:33:25,863
- Did you have an opportunity
to upload the documents

2076
01:33:25,863 --> 01:33:26,743
that I requested?

2077
01:33:26,743 --> 01:33:28,413
- Yes, I did.

2078
01:33:28,413 --> 01:33:31,495
- Let me take a look and
make sure we received those.

2079
01:33:37,883 --> 01:33:39,333
Okay.

2080
01:33:39,333 --> 01:33:40,866
Yes, we're good.

2081
01:33:44,113 --> 01:33:46,323
- Now, be honest with me.

2082
01:33:46,323 --> 01:33:48,463
Does it look like I have a case here?

2083
01:33:48,463 --> 01:33:49,623
- Absolutely.

2084
01:33:49,623 --> 01:33:52,273
I had a chance to look
over the police report

2085
01:33:52,273 --> 01:33:54,303
and we're definitely going to
move forward with your case.

2086
01:33:54,303 --> 01:33:56,503
- Yes, thank you.

2087
01:33:56,503 --> 01:33:58,682
- Oh, you're welcome.
- Thank you.

2088
01:33:58,682 --> 01:34:01,373
Wow, is this your wife?

2089
01:34:01,373 --> 01:34:03,413
- Oh no, we're not married.

2090
01:34:03,413 --> 01:34:05,182
Maybe, one day.

2091
01:34:05,182 --> 01:34:06,016
I sure hope so.

2092
01:34:06,993 --> 01:34:09,973
- Now listen, I hate to pry,

2093
01:34:09,973 --> 01:34:14,223
but I swear, she looks like
someone I go to church with.

2094
01:34:14,223 --> 01:34:16,373
Is her name Shawn?

2095
01:34:16,373 --> 01:34:18,403
- Yes, her name is Shawn.

2096
01:34:18,403 --> 01:34:19,502
- Wow, gorgeous.

2097
01:34:23,262 --> 01:34:25,213
- Did you say,

2098
01:34:25,213 --> 01:34:27,143
that you know her from church?

2099
01:34:27,143 --> 01:34:28,655
- Yeah, church.

2100
01:34:33,963 --> 01:34:34,796
Wait a minute.

2101
01:34:35,843 --> 01:34:37,093
You mean to tell me

2102
01:34:38,563 --> 01:34:41,363
that you two used to go
to the same church, right?

2103
01:34:41,363 --> 01:34:45,373
- No, we go to the same church right now.

2104
01:34:45,373 --> 01:34:48,423
Her dad is Pastor Reed
down at Second Baptist,

2105
01:34:48,423 --> 01:34:50,273
over on First Street.

2106
01:34:50,273 --> 01:34:55,012
Yeah, he took over for a guy
that stepped down last year.

2107
01:34:55,012 --> 01:34:56,403
Now, listen,

2108
01:34:56,403 --> 01:34:58,373
I don't mean to be messy,

2109
01:34:58,373 --> 01:35:00,653
but I heard he was messing

2110
01:35:00,653 --> 01:35:03,133
with one of the member's wives.

2111
01:35:03,133 --> 01:35:05,703
Hmm hmm, cheating.

2112
01:35:05,703 --> 01:35:07,466
- Is that right?
- Yes.

2113
01:35:08,793 --> 01:35:10,883
- You're sure we're talking
about the same person?

2114
01:35:10,883 --> 01:35:13,023
She never mentioned that
her dad was a pastor.

2115
01:35:13,023 --> 01:35:14,586
- Whoa, whoa, listen.

2116
01:35:15,512 --> 01:35:16,623
I am so sorry.

2117
01:35:16,623 --> 01:35:19,993
I didn't mean to cause any confusion.

2118
01:35:19,993 --> 01:35:22,553
Listen, I just assumed that you knew

2119
01:35:22,553 --> 01:35:24,843
that your possible future wife

2120
01:35:24,843 --> 01:35:27,836
would let you know that
her father was a pastor.

2121
01:35:29,623 --> 01:35:30,473
- You know what?

2122
01:35:30,473 --> 01:35:31,583
No need to apologize.

2123
01:35:31,583 --> 01:35:33,043
Matter of fact,

2124
01:35:33,043 --> 01:35:34,372
she did mention that one day.

2125
01:35:34,372 --> 01:35:36,573
I just, I must've forgot.

2126
01:35:36,573 --> 01:35:38,973
- Well, now that you put it that way,

2127
01:35:38,973 --> 01:35:40,553
listen, when you see her,

2128
01:35:40,553 --> 01:35:42,393
be sure to tell her I said hi

2129
01:35:42,393 --> 01:35:43,616
and make sure to let her know,

2130
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:46,493
I will see her this Sunday at church.

2131
01:35:46,493 --> 01:35:49,657
- Oh, believe me, I definitely will.

2132
01:35:53,953 --> 01:35:56,988
-  So glad you got
me out of the office.

2133
01:35:56,988 --> 01:35:58,623
I was just thinking about you.

2134
01:35:58,623 --> 01:35:59,456
- Really?

2135
01:36:00,373 --> 01:36:02,473
What were you thinking?

2136
01:36:02,473 --> 01:36:04,102
- How you've changed my life

2137
01:36:04,102 --> 01:36:06,126
in ways that I couldn't even imagine.

2138
01:36:08,223 --> 01:36:10,453
But that's not the reason
why you had me to come by.

2139
01:36:10,453 --> 01:36:12,325
So, what's going on?

2140
01:36:13,733 --> 01:36:15,893
- I was wondering if you wanted to

2141
01:36:15,893 --> 01:36:18,346
go with Courtney and I
to the movies on Sunday?

2142
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,852
- This Sunday?

2143
01:36:21,852 --> 01:36:23,583
- Yeah, this Sunday.

2144
01:36:23,583 --> 01:36:25,243
Is that an issue?

2145
01:36:25,243 --> 01:36:26,863
- Can I check with you or-

2146
01:36:26,863 --> 01:36:28,453
- Wow.

2147
01:36:28,453 --> 01:36:30,173
I didn't know your man had to get in line

2148
01:36:30,173 --> 01:36:31,490
to spend time with you.

2149
01:36:34,762 --> 01:36:36,243
- Jackson, that's not it.

2150
01:36:36,243 --> 01:36:37,733
- It's not?

2151
01:36:37,733 --> 01:36:38,803
What is it, then?

2152
01:36:38,803 --> 01:36:41,286
Is there something you
need to share with me?

2153
01:36:42,153 --> 01:36:44,383
- I tried to tell you before.

2154
01:36:44,383 --> 01:36:45,216
- Tell me what?

2155
01:36:48,882 --> 01:36:50,632
- Can you just hear me out, please?

2156
01:36:52,543 --> 01:36:53,376
- I'm listening.

2157
01:36:56,463 --> 01:37:00,283
- The reason why I'm unsure is because

2158
01:37:00,283 --> 01:37:01,836
I'm the head of that church.

2159
01:37:03,193 --> 01:37:05,973
My father pastors Second Baptist Church.

2160
01:37:05,973 --> 01:37:07,693
And I direct the choir

2161
01:37:08,903 --> 01:37:10,486
and they need me at service.

2162
01:37:12,003 --> 01:37:14,473
I am so sorry.

2163
01:37:14,473 --> 01:37:16,682
I know I should have told you way earlier.

2164
01:37:16,682 --> 01:37:17,682
- So why didn't you?

2165
01:37:19,613 --> 01:37:21,849
-  Because I know
how you feel about church.

2166
01:37:29,163 --> 01:37:31,086
- So you keep it from me, instead?

2167
01:37:32,483 --> 01:37:34,923
You let me tell you over and over again,

2168
01:37:34,923 --> 01:37:37,836
how I feel about these
churches and these preachers.

2169
01:37:38,693 --> 01:37:40,716
Never found a time to tell me?

2170
01:37:41,682 --> 01:37:42,946
That was selfish!

2171
01:37:43,843 --> 01:37:46,993
- I tried to tell you at
the house and at the park.

2172
01:37:46,993 --> 01:37:48,546
- I trusted you, Shawn.

2173
01:37:49,773 --> 01:37:51,186
Had you around Courtney.

2174
01:37:52,243 --> 01:37:56,596
And all this time, it's
been nothing but a lie.

2175
01:37:56,596 --> 01:37:58,453
- I didn't want something so small

2176
01:37:58,453 --> 01:38:00,016
to come in between what we have.

2177
01:38:00,016 --> 01:38:02,206
- Well, from the looks of things,

2178
01:38:03,213 --> 01:38:04,653
what you and I were building

2179
01:38:05,803 --> 01:38:07,303
was built on nothing but lies.

2180
01:38:08,262 --> 01:38:09,512
- What do you mean, were?

2181
01:38:10,463 --> 01:38:12,373
- What I mean is,

2182
01:38:12,373 --> 01:38:14,783
I don't want to see you anymore.

2183
01:38:14,783 --> 01:38:16,233
- We're done.

2184
01:38:16,233 --> 01:38:19,743
- Huh, so you gonna walk away from us

2185
01:38:19,743 --> 01:38:22,283
because my father is a pastor?

2186
01:38:22,283 --> 01:38:25,273
- No, I'm walking away because you lied

2187
01:38:25,273 --> 01:38:26,273
and can't be trusted.

2188
01:38:26,273 --> 01:38:27,506
- Can't be trusted?

2189
01:38:28,931 --> 01:38:30,153
Well, if what my father does

2190
01:38:30,153 --> 01:38:32,486
bothers you enough for you to leave me,

2191
01:38:33,952 --> 01:38:35,102
did you ever really love me?

2192
01:38:35,102 --> 01:38:35,963
- Oh, hell no.

2193
01:38:35,963 --> 01:38:38,436
Don't try to flip and twist this up on me.

2194
01:38:39,357 --> 01:38:40,607
I'm not the one who lied.

2195
01:38:41,753 --> 01:38:46,223
- Listen, I know your
ex-wife hurt you bad,

2196
01:38:46,223 --> 01:38:48,336
but that was her, not me.

2197
01:38:49,197 --> 01:38:51,446
And yeah, I should've
told you, but I didn't.

2198
01:38:52,673 --> 01:38:54,530
So what now?

2199
01:38:54,530 --> 01:38:57,186
You're gonna run away like you always do?

2200
01:38:58,323 --> 01:38:59,155
Huh?

2201
01:39:00,483 --> 01:39:02,483
Well, you just keep on running, Jackson.

2202
01:39:05,325 --> 01:39:07,346
Did it ever cross your mind that maybe,

2203
01:39:08,423 --> 01:39:11,593
just maybe, you was the
one to make the mistake

2204
01:39:11,593 --> 01:39:13,543
and marry the wrong person?

2205
01:39:13,543 --> 01:39:14,983
- The only mistake I made

2206
01:39:16,133 --> 01:39:17,126
was trusting you.

2207
01:39:20,805 --> 01:39:21,637
- I love you.

2208
01:39:22,903 --> 01:39:25,026
And what I feel for you is real.

2209
01:39:27,293 --> 01:39:29,463
But you need to quit having a pity party

2210
01:39:29,463 --> 01:39:30,966
and get over it!

2211
01:39:32,028 --> 01:39:33,693
Because you will never,

2212
01:39:33,693 --> 01:39:35,923
and I mean never be able to move on

2213
01:39:35,923 --> 01:39:37,473
unless you let go of your past.

2214
01:39:40,613 --> 01:39:41,446
Bye, Jackson.

2215
01:40:17,704 --> 01:40:18,813
- Y'all crazy.
- I'm telling you man.

2216
01:40:18,813 --> 01:40:20,444
Y'all need to get with them triple D's.

2217
01:40:22,162 --> 01:40:23,632
Okay.

2218
01:40:23,632 --> 01:40:24,465
Why not?

2219
01:40:26,011 --> 01:40:26,843
Hold on, hold on.

2220
01:40:26,843 --> 01:40:28,543
J, you tell Brian about the argument

2221
01:40:28,543 --> 01:40:31,274
you got into with baby
girl the other night?

2222
01:40:31,274 --> 01:40:32,533
- Man, what happened?

2223
01:40:32,533 --> 01:40:33,773
- I'd rather not get into it.

2224
01:40:33,773 --> 01:40:35,963
- Whatever it was, had to be bad

2225
01:40:35,963 --> 01:40:38,973
'cause baby girl left out of
here with smoke behind her.

2226
01:40:38,973 --> 01:40:40,793
- What?
- Tracy, just drop it.

2227
01:40:40,793 --> 01:40:43,343
I said, I'd rather not talk about it, man.

2228
01:40:43,343 --> 01:40:45,123
- Damn man, she was
nice, man. I liked her.

2229
01:40:45,123 --> 01:40:46,913
- Yeah, well, looks can be deceiving.

2230
01:40:46,913 --> 01:40:49,453
- I feel you on that, man,
'cause women like that,

2231
01:40:49,453 --> 01:40:50,733
always got something to hide.

2232
01:40:50,733 --> 01:40:51,913
- You can say that again.

2233
01:40:51,913 --> 01:40:54,863
- Women like that always
got something to hide.

2234
01:40:54,863 --> 01:40:55,973
- Hey man, what was she hiding?

2235
01:40:55,973 --> 01:40:58,293
- Man, she just wasn't
what she appeared to be.

2236
01:40:58,293 --> 01:40:59,126
That's all I'm saying.

2237
01:40:59,126 --> 01:41:00,193
- I tried to tell you, man.

2238
01:41:00,193 --> 01:41:01,026
Them pretty girls is the ones

2239
01:41:01,026 --> 01:41:02,977
you always got to watch out for.

2240
01:41:02,977 --> 01:41:04,209
Was she a stripper or something?

2241
01:41:04,209 --> 01:41:06,245
- No, she lied to me about her father.

2242
01:41:07,493 --> 01:41:09,023
- And that's why it won't work?

2243
01:41:09,023 --> 01:41:11,273
- Her father is a pastor.

2244
01:41:11,273 --> 01:41:12,852
- And that's why I won't work!

2245
01:41:12,852 --> 01:41:14,113
- Man, you think I would get involved

2246
01:41:14,113 --> 01:41:15,943
with a woman whose father is a preacher

2247
01:41:15,943 --> 01:41:17,313
after everything I've been through?

2248
01:41:17,313 --> 01:41:19,200
- Oh man, you got to let
that bitterness go, man.

2249
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:20,329
- I don't have to let anything go, man.

2250
01:41:20,329 --> 01:41:21,723
- Man, hold on, hold on, hold on.

2251
01:41:21,723 --> 01:41:22,943
You're trying to tell me,

2252
01:41:22,943 --> 01:41:25,120
because Lynn cheat on you with a pastor

2253
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,376
and Shawn father happen to be a pastor,

2254
01:41:27,376 --> 01:41:28,623
that you walked away?

2255
01:41:28,623 --> 01:41:30,602
Man, that got to be the dumbest thing

2256
01:41:30,602 --> 01:41:31,943
I've ever heard you say.

2257
01:41:31,943 --> 01:41:33,003
- Man, we gonna hang out

2258
01:41:33,003 --> 01:41:34,213
and are were gonna sit here
and kick it like females?

2259
01:41:34,213 --> 01:41:35,153
I'm done.

2260
01:41:35,153 --> 01:41:38,163
- Nah, I'm done, man.

hear your wonderful voice?

2273
01:42:39,527 --> 01:42:40,610
- I guess so.

2274
01:42:41,467 --> 01:42:42,896
- Is something wrong?

2275
01:42:42,896 --> 01:42:44,950
- Everything is fine, dad.

2276
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,663
- Did your friend come today?

2277
01:42:46,663 --> 01:42:48,206
- No, he couldn't make it.

2278
01:42:49,173 --> 01:42:50,096
Maybe, next week.

2279
01:42:51,223 --> 01:42:52,533
- Next week is good.

2280
01:42:52,533 --> 01:42:55,493
We need more men, positive role models

2281
01:42:55,493 --> 01:42:57,512
and good fathers in the church.

2282
01:42:57,512 --> 01:42:59,793
Do you think he'd be
interested in helping us out?

2283
01:42:59,793 --> 01:43:01,623
- Dad, can we drop it, please?

2284
01:43:02,949 --> 01:43:05,303
You got a Sunday service to get ready for.

2285
01:43:05,303 --> 01:43:06,788
- I'll drop it for now.

2286
01:43:06,788 --> 01:43:08,343
But we're gonna to talk about it later.

2287
01:43:08,343 --> 01:43:10,236
- I said I'd rather not discuss it.

2288
01:43:12,547 --> 01:43:13,380
Besides,

2289
01:43:14,601 --> 01:43:15,953
I don't think I'm going to be seeing

2290
01:43:15,953 --> 01:43:18,287
much more of Jackson, anyway.

2291
01:43:18,287 --> 01:43:20,432
- Well, I'm sorry about that,

2292
01:43:20,432 --> 01:43:21,333
but God knows what's best.

2293
01:43:21,333 --> 01:43:24,486
- Dad, can you stop it
with the God stuff, please?

2294
01:43:25,503 --> 01:43:26,863
Every, since I was a little girl,

2295
01:43:26,863 --> 01:43:29,063
it's been God this and God that.

2296
01:43:29,063 --> 01:43:30,273
And then if I just trust in God,

2297
01:43:30,273 --> 01:43:32,653
that everything will be just fine.

2298
01:43:32,653 --> 01:43:35,432
Here it is, I meet the man of my dreams

2299
01:43:35,432 --> 01:43:36,723
and I can't even be with him

2300
01:43:36,723 --> 01:43:40,333
because of what a
so-called man of God did?

2301
01:43:40,333 --> 01:43:41,405
Save it!

2302
01:43:42,523 --> 01:43:46,823
- Baby girl, your mother
and I raised you right.

2303
01:43:46,823 --> 01:43:50,113
We raised you to have a
relationship with God.

2304
01:43:50,113 --> 01:43:51,923
And just because you are a believer,

2305
01:43:51,923 --> 01:43:54,633
does not exempt you from
trials and tribulations.

2306
01:43:54,633 --> 01:43:57,213
And there are people that
call themselves preachers,

2307
01:43:57,213 --> 01:43:58,813
all of them are not called.

2308
01:43:58,813 --> 01:44:01,333
And those that are, guess what?

2309
01:44:01,333 --> 01:44:03,682
They have issues, too.

2310
01:44:03,682 --> 01:44:05,243
These people that are out here,

2311
01:44:05,243 --> 01:44:06,963
they're going through
trials and tribulations,

2312
01:44:06,963 --> 01:44:08,623
but it should not make you waiver

2313
01:44:08,623 --> 01:44:11,023
from what God has called you to do.

2314
01:44:11,023 --> 01:44:13,226
- My faith is not wavering.

2315
01:44:14,926 --> 01:44:19,416
I just wish Jackson wasn't so hurt.

2316
01:44:21,293 --> 01:44:23,343
And I don't even know
what to do to help him.

2317
01:44:23,343 --> 01:44:26,813
- The best thing you can
do for him is pray for him.

2318
01:44:26,813 --> 01:44:28,535
Now, get yourself together

2319
01:44:28,535 --> 01:44:30,385
and let's go out here and praise God.

2320
01:44:32,741 --> 01:44:35,114
♪ Lord, I trust in you ♪

2321
01:44:35,114 --> 01:44:39,918
♪ Lord, I trust in you ♪

2322
01:44:39,918 --> 01:44:43,503
♪ Lord, I need you ♪

2323
01:44:43,503 --> 01:44:47,556
- I'm glad you finally
decided to accept my offer.

2324
01:44:48,533 --> 01:44:51,973
I was beginning to think you
didn't find me attractive.

2325
01:44:51,973 --> 01:44:54,432
- I usually don't date coworkers.

2326
01:44:54,432 --> 01:44:55,575
That's all it was.

2327
01:44:58,023 --> 01:44:59,993
- So you do find me attractive?

2328
01:44:59,993 --> 01:45:00,866
- Very much.

2329
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:03,850
But, that's all I know
about you right now.

2330
01:45:05,352 --> 01:45:06,762
Tell me,

2331
01:45:06,762 --> 01:45:09,012
what are some of your likes and dislikes?

2332
01:45:09,012 --> 01:45:13,093
- Well, I like shoes, clothes, purses,

2333
01:45:13,093 --> 01:45:14,526
you know, things like that.

2334
01:45:14,526 --> 01:45:16,036
- All right, okay.

2335
01:45:17,053 --> 01:45:20,330
So where do you see
yourself in five years?

2336
01:45:20,330 --> 01:45:22,973
- Can I get you guys anything to drink?

2337
01:45:22,973 --> 01:45:24,873
- I'll take a glass of Chardonnay.

2338
01:45:24,873 --> 01:45:26,283
- Excuse me, Chardonnay?

2339
01:45:26,283 --> 01:45:27,533
We don't serve that here.

2340
01:45:28,461 --> 01:45:30,643
- I wouldn't think that you did.

2341
01:45:30,643 --> 01:45:33,512
- I'll take a Long Island, instead.

2342
01:45:33,512 --> 01:45:35,733
- Ma'am, we don't serve liquor here.

2343
01:45:35,733 --> 01:45:37,556
This is a cafe.

2344
01:45:39,423 --> 01:45:40,852
- Well, in that case,

2345
01:45:40,852 --> 01:45:43,173
bring me a hot chocolate

2346
01:45:43,173 --> 01:45:45,682
since he's so hot and chocolate.

2347
01:45:45,682 --> 01:45:47,063
- And for you, sir?

2348
01:45:47,063 --> 01:45:49,143
- We'll just take two espressos, please.

2349
01:45:49,143 --> 01:45:51,166
- Gotcha, coming right up.
- Thank you.

2350
01:45:53,273 --> 01:45:55,676
- You do know I could
order my own beverage?

2351
01:45:56,512 --> 01:45:59,083
- You ordered a Chardonnay

2352
01:45:59,083 --> 01:46:00,236
and a Long Island.

2353
01:46:02,182 --> 01:46:05,293
How old are you again?
- 30.

2354
01:46:05,293 --> 01:46:07,243
- 30, and you didn't know

2355
01:46:07,243 --> 01:46:09,883
that there's no liquor at coffee shops?

2356
01:46:09,883 --> 01:46:12,102
- So you're trying to say
that you're better than me,

2357
01:46:12,102 --> 01:46:14,783
Mr. Lawyer with a corner office?

2358
01:46:14,783 --> 01:46:16,972
- No, not at all.

2359
01:46:16,972 --> 01:46:18,283
- Here you go.

2360
01:46:18,283 --> 01:46:20,716
Would you guys be ordering any brunch?

2361
01:46:21,593 --> 01:46:25,623
- Yes, I will just have the
grilled veggie burger, please.

2362
01:46:25,623 --> 01:46:27,769
- Okay, and for you?

2363
01:46:27,769 --> 01:46:32,769
- I'll take the corn dog
with the chili cheese fries.

2364
01:46:33,753 --> 01:46:36,293
No, wait, I'll take

2365
01:46:37,443 --> 01:46:39,443
chicken fingers.

2366
01:46:39,443 --> 01:46:40,416
No, wait.

2367
01:46:41,373 --> 01:46:43,273
What is this?

2368
01:46:43,273 --> 01:46:45,233
A pu-nan-i?

2369
01:46:45,233 --> 01:46:47,526
- Ma'am, it is pronounced panini.

2370
01:46:48,443 --> 01:46:51,223
- Okay, you keep that.

2371
01:46:51,223 --> 01:46:53,503
I'll just take whatever he's having.

2372
01:46:53,503 --> 01:46:55,566
- Okay, will that be all, sir?

2373
01:46:56,414 --> 01:46:57,283
- Yes, it will be.

2374
01:46:57,283 --> 01:47:00,083
And please, make it quick.

2375
01:47:00,083 --> 01:47:02,102
I'm sure you understand?

2376
01:47:02,102 --> 01:47:03,352
- Oh, I do.

2377
01:47:03,352 --> 01:47:04,253
I definitely do.

2378
01:47:04,253 --> 01:47:07,053
I'm gonna get started on that.

2379
01:47:07,053 --> 01:47:07,886
- Thank you.

2380
01:47:09,893 --> 01:47:13,323
You do realize that this is a cafe, right?

2381
01:47:13,323 --> 01:47:15,143
- What's that supposed to mean?

2382
01:47:15,143 --> 01:47:17,063
It means that you don't have to act

2383
01:47:17,063 --> 01:47:19,530
like you at the local Coney Island.

2384
01:47:19,530 --> 01:47:22,006
-  Whatever.

2385
01:47:23,083 --> 01:47:28,083
Anyway, how did you become
this big time lawyer and stuff?

2386
01:47:28,503 --> 01:47:30,293
- There is no stuff.

2387
01:47:30,293 --> 01:47:33,318
I studied and went to
school to get my law degree.

2388
01:47:33,318 --> 01:47:35,182
- That's what's up.

2389
01:47:35,182 --> 01:47:36,432
You're so sexy.

2390
01:47:39,143 --> 01:47:40,783
- Oh, would you look at the time?

2391
01:47:40,783 --> 01:47:43,303
You know what, I'm sorry.

2392
01:47:43,303 --> 01:47:44,673
I forgot, I have to pick up my daughter

2393
01:47:44,673 --> 01:47:45,873
from her piano practice.

2394
01:47:46,923 --> 01:47:49,613
Wait, can we get those
two orders to go, please?

2395
01:47:49,613 --> 01:47:52,583
- Of course, you can.
- Yes, thank you.

2396
01:47:52,583 --> 01:47:53,733
- No problem.

2397
01:47:54,583 --> 01:47:55,646
- You know what?

2398
01:47:55,646 --> 01:48:00,573
I do love a man who has
his priorities straight.

2399
01:48:00,573 --> 01:48:02,483
Maybe we could hook up later.

2400
01:48:02,483 --> 01:48:03,432
- That's not possible.

2401
01:48:03,432 --> 01:48:06,113
We do homework afterwards,

2402
01:48:06,113 --> 01:48:08,086
but maybe some other time.

2403
01:48:09,423 --> 01:48:11,155
- That is such a turn on.

2404
01:48:12,373 --> 01:48:14,873
- And this is such a turn off.

2405
01:48:18,323 --> 01:48:22,173
- J, what's up with you and
honey, man, from the job?

2406
01:48:22,173 --> 01:48:24,366
What happened to the
date y'all had yesterday?

2407
01:48:24,366 --> 01:48:25,743
- Eh.

2408
01:48:25,743 --> 01:48:28,840
- So we keep it secrets now?
- Hmm hmm.

2409
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:31,836
-  Man, she
ordered some chili fries.

2410
01:48:32,713 --> 01:48:34,393
- Okay?

2411
01:48:34,393 --> 01:48:36,543
What's wrong with that?

2412
01:48:36,543 --> 01:48:40,133
- Bro, we were at a cafe.

2413
01:48:40,133 --> 01:48:43,518
- Okay, what's wrong with that?

2414
01:48:43,518 --> 01:48:46,313
- Brian, tell this clown

2415
01:48:46,313 --> 01:48:48,073
that booty and no brains,

2416
01:48:48,073 --> 01:48:50,155
equals zero chance of a relationship.

2417
01:48:51,047 --> 01:48:53,146
- Who said something about a relationship?

2418
01:48:54,043 --> 01:48:56,815
Man, just have some fun.

2419
01:48:56,815 --> 01:48:58,413
-  Come on, Tracy.

2420
01:48:58,413 --> 01:49:01,352
Me and Jack's both seen some
of the women you mess with.

2421
01:49:01,352 --> 01:49:02,186
Let's just say,

2422
01:49:02,186 --> 01:49:03,833
neither one of them gonna
be winning a beauty contest,

2423
01:49:03,833 --> 01:49:05,413
no time soon.

2424
01:49:05,413 --> 01:49:08,593
- Yeah and you know, you
don't screen them, at all.

2425
01:49:08,593 --> 01:49:10,245
- Really, really?

2426
01:49:11,133 --> 01:49:13,512
Hey, y'all hating on the process, man.

2427
01:49:13,512 --> 01:49:16,606
Y'all know I love my
women with the triple D's.

2428
01:49:18,043 --> 01:49:19,743
- What's the triple D's?

2429
01:49:19,743 --> 01:49:21,313
- Dingy.

2430
01:49:21,313 --> 01:49:22,628
Dumb.

2431
01:49:22,628 --> 01:49:23,536
And desperate!

2432
01:49:25,343 --> 01:49:26,553
Hmm hmm.

2433
01:49:26,553 --> 01:49:27,959
- We all three intelligent,
smart brothers, right?

2434
01:49:27,959 --> 01:49:28,793
- Hmm hmm.

2435
01:49:28,793 --> 01:49:30,292
- Hey, hold on, B.

2436
01:49:30,292 --> 01:49:31,613
I don't know about all three of us.

2437
01:49:31,613 --> 01:49:33,182
- Come on, man, think about it.

2438
01:49:33,182 --> 01:49:34,323
I'm the vice-president

2439
01:49:34,323 --> 01:49:36,233
at one of the largest banks in Atlanta.

2440
01:49:36,233 --> 01:49:39,223
You two are lawyers at one
of the biggest law firms.

2441
01:49:39,223 --> 01:49:41,146
So we don't have to settle
for none of these women

2442
01:49:41,146 --> 01:49:42,143
who don't got their stuff together, man.

2443
01:49:42,143 --> 01:49:43,816
- You got a good point there, B.

2444
01:49:45,173 --> 01:49:47,838
- Look man, I ain't
telling you to get married

2445
01:49:47,838 --> 01:49:49,226
and have a bunch of kids.

2446
01:49:50,173 --> 01:49:52,836
I'm just saying, Jack, have some fun, man.

2447
01:49:54,375 --> 01:49:55,375
- Man, I don't know.

2448
01:49:56,363 --> 01:49:58,253
- Listen, man, call Shawn.

2449
01:49:58,253 --> 01:49:59,160
You miss her.

2450
01:50:04,053 --> 01:50:05,303
- Thanks for inviting me.

2451
01:50:07,153 --> 01:50:08,352
I knew you'd reconsider.

2452
01:50:09,213 --> 01:50:11,298
- Yeah, I'm actually glad that I did.

2453
01:50:11,298 --> 01:50:13,083
- Me, too.

2454
01:50:13,083 --> 01:50:15,343
This is such a nice neighborhood.

2455
01:50:15,343 --> 01:50:17,233
I could see myself living here.

2456
01:50:17,233 --> 01:50:18,655
- Really?
- Yeah.

2457
01:50:20,262 --> 01:50:21,643
You know what?
- What's up?

2458
01:50:21,643 --> 01:50:23,803
- We're going to have so much fun tonight.

2459
01:50:23,803 --> 01:50:25,276
- Yes, we are, Shawn.

2460
01:50:25,276 --> 01:50:27,055
- Shawn?

2461
01:50:27,055 --> 01:50:28,741
Who is Shawn?

2462
01:50:28,741 --> 01:50:29,574
- I didn't call you, Shawn.

2463
01:50:29,574 --> 01:50:31,352
- You just call me, Shawn, Jackson.

2464
01:50:31,352 --> 01:50:32,289
- I did?

2465
01:50:32,289 --> 01:50:33,426
-  Yeah.

2466
01:50:34,657 --> 01:50:36,066
- I'm so sorry.

2467
01:50:38,843 --> 01:50:40,296
-  Let's go inside.

2468
01:50:42,223 --> 01:50:43,182
- You know what?

2469
01:50:43,182 --> 01:50:44,408
Oh, I'm sorry.

2470
01:50:44,408 --> 01:50:46,163
I can't do this.

2471
01:50:46,163 --> 01:50:47,363
- You can't do this?

2472
01:50:47,363 --> 01:50:48,866
- I can't do this.

2473
01:50:50,913 --> 01:50:53,863
- You know what, Jackson, this
is the second time with you.

2474
01:50:54,743 --> 01:50:56,033
When you get it together,

2475
01:50:56,033 --> 01:50:57,216
you know my number.

2476
01:50:58,983 --> 01:51:01,796
And the name is Sherry.

2477
01:51:03,075 --> 01:51:03,915
- Damn.

2478
01:51:10,966 --> 01:51:13,273
- I heard this movie was pretty good.

2479
01:51:13,273 --> 01:51:14,106
- Yeah, me too.

2480
01:51:15,163 --> 01:51:16,483
Thank you for the invite.

2481
01:51:16,483 --> 01:51:17,833
- I'm glad you can make it.

2482
01:51:23,413 --> 01:51:26,000
- Hey, what are you doing?

2483
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,245
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2484
01:51:28,245 --> 01:51:29,803
Nope, nope, nope, nmm mm.

2485
01:51:29,803 --> 01:51:31,213
- Come on, don't fight it.

2486
01:51:31,213 --> 01:51:32,633
- Fight what?

2487
01:51:32,633 --> 01:51:33,852
- This.

2488
01:51:33,852 --> 01:51:35,413
I'm feeling you.

2489
01:51:35,413 --> 01:51:36,313
I wanna be with you

2490
01:51:36,313 --> 01:51:38,102
and I want to be your woman.

2491
01:51:38,102 --> 01:51:40,366
- You don't even know me!

2492
01:51:41,352 --> 01:51:42,836
- I feel like I know enough.

2493
01:51:45,643 --> 01:51:46,476
- Okay.

2494
01:51:47,820 --> 01:51:49,758
I think it's time for you to leave, now.

2495
01:51:49,758 --> 01:51:50,591
Go ahead and go.

2496
01:51:50,591 --> 01:51:51,423
- Leave?

2497
01:51:51,423 --> 01:51:53,012
The movie just started.

2498
01:51:53,012 --> 01:51:55,036
- I know, but it has ended for you.

2499
01:51:59,387 --> 01:52:00,843
- Do you wanna talk about it?

2500
01:52:00,843 --> 01:52:02,313
'Cause we can talk about it.

2501
01:52:02,313 --> 01:52:05,021
Wait, first off, just please tell me,

2502
01:52:05,021 --> 01:52:06,104
who hurt you?

2503
01:52:08,730 --> 01:52:10,043
You can tell me.

2504
01:52:10,043 --> 01:52:11,593
- It's time for you to go, now.

2505
01:52:14,852 --> 01:52:15,692
- Okay.

2506
01:52:20,376 --> 01:52:22,176
- What is wrong with y'all brothers?

2507
01:52:23,543 --> 01:52:25,824
Y'all say y'all want a good woman.

2508
01:52:25,824 --> 01:52:28,224
Y'all get it and then
y'all just push them away?

2509
01:52:29,887 --> 01:52:32,870
- If you don't get your
fast tail up outta here.

2510
01:52:32,870 --> 01:52:33,704
- Now, I'm fast?

2511
01:52:34,541 --> 01:52:35,374
That's my cue.

2512
01:52:37,432 --> 01:52:38,783
Before I leave,

2513
01:52:38,783 --> 01:52:40,016
something is definitely wrong with you,

2514
01:52:40,016 --> 01:52:42,153
turning all this down.

2515
01:52:42,153 --> 01:52:43,682
So when I leave,

2516
01:52:43,682 --> 01:52:45,166
you better get a good look.

2517
01:52:46,216 --> 01:52:47,048
Okay?

2518
01:52:50,223 --> 01:52:51,056
- Bye, bye.

2519
01:52:56,363 --> 01:52:57,262
Hey, mama.

2520
01:52:57,262 --> 01:52:58,325
- Hey, baby.

2521
01:52:59,432 --> 01:53:01,123
You haven't answered your phone.

2522
01:53:01,123 --> 01:53:03,503
I've been calling you for days.

2523
01:53:03,503 --> 01:53:05,703
- Mama, I have a lot going on right now.

2524
01:53:05,703 --> 01:53:06,863
Is this an emergency?

2525
01:53:06,863 --> 01:53:08,182
- Yes, it's an emergency.

2526
01:53:08,182 --> 01:53:10,943
Anytime you don't answer
my call, it's an emergency.

2527
01:53:10,943 --> 01:53:11,846
What's going on?

2528
01:53:13,453 --> 01:53:16,003
- Mama, I just want to be left alone.

2529
01:53:16,003 --> 01:53:19,713
- Hmm, so I take it, this
about that girl you dating?

2530
01:53:19,713 --> 01:53:20,903
What happened?

2531
01:53:20,903 --> 01:53:22,486
- I'd rather not talk about it.

2532
01:53:25,243 --> 01:53:29,803
- Baby, that was the happiest
I had seen you in a long time.

2533
01:53:29,803 --> 01:53:31,983
Now tell me what happened?

2534
01:53:31,983 --> 01:53:33,983
- Mama, she lied to me.

2535
01:53:33,983 --> 01:53:34,816
- Oh.

2536
01:53:35,779 --> 01:53:36,611
Okay.

2537
01:53:37,543 --> 01:53:39,443
I want to share something with you.

2538
01:53:39,443 --> 01:53:41,055
- Mama, please.

2539
01:53:41,055 --> 01:53:43,053
I don't want to hear one of
your long drawn out stories.

2540
01:53:43,053 --> 01:53:44,323
Mama, I'm not in the mood.

2541
01:53:44,323 --> 01:53:46,066
- Oh, you gonna want to hear this?

2542
01:53:46,973 --> 01:53:48,686
When I first met your father,

2543
01:53:49,783 --> 01:53:53,443
I did not share with him my
inability to have children

2544
01:53:53,443 --> 01:53:58,168
because all he talked about
was having a son.

2545
01:53:58,168 --> 01:54:00,516
When I didn't get pregnant,

2546
01:54:01,613 --> 01:54:04,436
he wanted to have tests done
because he thought it was him.

2547
01:54:05,373 --> 01:54:07,123
And when he found out it was me, baby,

2548
01:54:07,123 --> 01:54:09,283
he was devastated.

2549
01:54:09,283 --> 01:54:10,816
Completely upset.

2550
01:54:12,223 --> 01:54:15,883
- Mama, if you couldn't get
pregnant, how did I get here?

2551
01:54:15,883 --> 01:54:18,363
- Baby, let me finish.

2552
01:54:18,363 --> 01:54:21,723
I did not tell your father
that I couldn't have children

2553
01:54:21,723 --> 01:54:24,593
because I didn't want
to hurt his feelings.

2554
01:54:24,593 --> 01:54:27,896
Now when he first found
out, baby, he was angry.

2555
01:54:28,852 --> 01:54:32,053
But after some time, he got past it

2556
01:54:33,793 --> 01:54:36,636
and he realized that I was
just trying to protect him.

2557
01:54:37,753 --> 01:54:38,653
We worked it out

2558
01:54:39,533 --> 01:54:42,856
and after a small routine
procedure, I got pregnant.

2559
01:54:44,901 --> 01:54:47,108
- So, am I adopted?

2560
01:54:47,108 --> 01:54:50,420
-  Boy, of course not.

2561
01:54:50,420 --> 01:54:52,753
- I have to check, I have to check, mama.

2562
01:54:52,753 --> 01:54:55,413
- Listen, the point is,

2563
01:54:55,413 --> 01:54:58,886
if he hadn't forgiven me,
baby, you wouldn't be here.

2564
01:55:00,041 --> 01:55:03,984
- Hmm, thanks, mama,
I needed to hear that.

2565
01:55:03,984 --> 01:55:04,816
- Hmm hmm.

2566
01:55:05,873 --> 01:55:07,973
- I think I know why Shawn didn't tell me.

2567
01:55:09,243 --> 01:55:10,696
It wasn't to deceive me.

2568
01:55:11,733 --> 01:55:13,182
It was to protect me.

2569
01:55:13,182 --> 01:55:16,293
- Oh, baby, now you're starting to get it.

2570
01:55:16,293 --> 01:55:17,806
- Mama, I treated her so bad.

2571
01:55:18,663 --> 01:55:19,836
- Hmm, that's okay.

2572
01:55:20,743 --> 01:55:21,596
Do you love her?

2573
01:55:22,803 --> 01:55:24,863
- I really do love her.

2574
01:55:24,863 --> 01:55:26,789
- Well then, get up off your behind, boy,

2575
01:55:26,789 --> 01:55:29,443
and go get that woman.

2576
01:55:29,443 --> 01:55:31,673
- Okay, I'mma get out of here, mama.

2577
01:55:31,673 --> 01:55:32,760
I appreciate you.

2578
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:33,813
- Aw, you welcome.

2579
01:55:33,813 --> 01:55:35,643
I love you, now.
- Hmm hmm.

2580
01:55:35,643 --> 01:55:37,003
- See you later on.
- All right.

2581
01:55:37,003 --> 01:55:38,273
And stop all that moping.

2582
01:55:38,273 --> 01:55:41,163
Thomas' don't mope, baby.
- All right, mama.

2583
01:55:41,163 --> 01:55:43,432
I see you later.
- See ya later.

2584
01:55:43,432 --> 01:55:45,646
I love you.
- Love you, too.

2585
01:55:50,873 --> 01:55:52,206
- Hey, Jackson.

2586
01:55:53,533 --> 01:55:56,014
- Robin, how are you doing?

2587
01:55:56,014 --> 01:55:56,847
- I'm doing good.

2588
01:55:56,847 --> 01:55:57,873
It's good to see you, man.

2589
01:55:57,873 --> 01:55:59,852
- Yeah, it's good to see you, too.

2590
01:55:59,852 --> 01:56:02,033
- Look, I know you probably think

2591
01:56:02,033 --> 01:56:04,213
that I was okay with what Lynn was doing,

2592
01:56:04,213 --> 01:56:06,273
but I told her that she
was making a big mistake

2593
01:56:06,273 --> 01:56:08,660
and now you're the one making the mistake.

2594
01:56:08,660 --> 01:56:10,120
- What are you talking about?

2595
01:56:10,120 --> 01:56:13,023
I'm talking about how you
need to learn how to forgive.

2596
01:56:13,023 --> 01:56:16,043
You can't keep holding on to
what you and Lynn went through

2597
01:56:16,043 --> 01:56:17,923
because once you probably
learn how to forgive,

2598
01:56:17,923 --> 01:56:19,738
you'll be able to love again.

2599
01:56:19,738 --> 01:56:21,213
-  Love again?

2600
01:56:21,213 --> 01:56:22,203
Yeah, right.

2601
01:56:22,203 --> 01:56:23,833
- Yes, love again.

2602
01:56:23,833 --> 01:56:25,623
I heard about you and your new little boo

2603
01:56:25,623 --> 01:56:27,533
and how you willing to let go of her

2604
01:56:27,533 --> 01:56:29,245
over something so small.

2605
01:56:30,602 --> 01:56:32,270
You need to forgive that girl.

2606
01:56:33,687 --> 01:56:34,520
But, I gotta go.

2607
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:37,216
I gotta get on up out of here.

2608
01:56:37,216 --> 01:56:38,783
I see you later, Jackson.

2609
01:56:38,783 --> 01:56:40,208
- Take care, Robin.

2610
01:56:46,887 --> 01:56:47,720
- Come in!

2611
01:56:52,323 --> 01:56:53,716
- Hello, Jackson.

2612
01:56:55,932 --> 01:56:57,606
- If you don't mind me asking,

2613
01:56:58,743 --> 01:57:00,543
what brings you by?

2614
01:57:00,543 --> 01:57:03,420
- I came to talk to you about my daughter.

2615
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:05,182
- With all due respect,

2616
01:57:05,182 --> 01:57:07,313
what Shawn and I are dealing with,

2617
01:57:07,313 --> 01:57:09,633
that's between the two of us.

2618
01:57:09,633 --> 01:57:10,466
- I understand that,

2619
01:57:10,466 --> 01:57:13,743
but I have something I just
need to share with you.

2620
01:57:13,743 --> 01:57:15,633
- Speak your piece.

2621
01:57:15,633 --> 01:57:18,883
- Jackson, I don't normally
get into Shawn's personal life,

2622
01:57:18,883 --> 01:57:22,899
but this time, I think I need to step in.

2623
01:57:22,899 --> 01:57:25,643
I'm very much aware that
she did not tell you

2624
01:57:25,643 --> 01:57:27,533
that I was a pastor.

2625
01:57:27,533 --> 01:57:30,425
And I agree, she should have.

2626
01:57:30,425 --> 01:57:32,182
But her not telling you

2627
01:57:32,182 --> 01:57:34,325
let's me know how much she cares for you.

2628
01:57:35,343 --> 01:57:38,143
- So, what you're saying is

2629
01:57:38,143 --> 01:57:40,443
her not telling me your profession,

2630
01:57:40,443 --> 01:57:42,386
suppose' to prove that she cares?

2631
01:57:43,573 --> 01:57:44,866
I don't understand.

2632
01:57:45,762 --> 01:57:47,762
- She knew how hurt you were

2633
01:57:47,762 --> 01:57:51,803
due to the actions of your
ex-wife and the pastor.

2634
01:57:51,803 --> 01:57:53,983
And she sympathizes with you,

2635
01:57:53,983 --> 01:57:57,643
but son, don't let the actions

2636
01:57:57,643 --> 01:58:01,393
of someone else make
you miss your blessing.

2637
01:58:01,393 --> 01:58:04,343
- Well, man comes before the cloth.

2638
01:58:04,343 --> 01:58:06,583
And it's not just one man.

2639
01:58:06,583 --> 01:58:08,762
Every time I turn on the television

2640
01:58:08,762 --> 01:58:12,852
or watch the news, it's
pastors, preachers or priests,

2641
01:58:12,852 --> 01:58:14,943
all in the news for wrongdoing.

2642
01:58:14,943 --> 01:58:17,863
- Well, Jackson, to be
honest, you're mad at them,

2643
01:58:17,863 --> 01:58:19,553
but you're also mad at yourself

2644
01:58:19,553 --> 01:58:21,693
for allowing it to happen.

2645
01:58:21,693 --> 01:58:24,553
When you married her, you
knew something wasn't right,

2646
01:58:24,553 --> 01:58:26,663
but yet, you married her anyway.

2647
01:58:26,663 --> 01:58:28,723
So the first thing you need to do

2648
01:58:28,723 --> 01:58:30,106
is forgive yourself.

2649
01:58:31,643 --> 01:58:34,403
- And what happens when I forgive myself?

2650
01:58:34,403 --> 01:58:38,405
- Then, you'll forgive others.

2651
01:58:48,493 --> 01:58:49,896
- Good morning, church.

2652
01:58:49,896 --> 01:58:50,729
- Good morning!

2653
01:58:50,729 --> 01:58:52,151
- I said, good morning, church!

2654
01:58:52,151 --> 01:58:52,984
Good morning!

2655
01:58:52,984 --> 01:58:54,913
- This is the day that the Lord has made

2656
01:58:54,913 --> 01:58:56,943
and we shall rejoice

2657
01:58:56,943 --> 01:58:58,903
and be glad in it!

2658
01:58:58,903 --> 01:59:02,413
I will say that we're going
to have a wonderful day

2659
01:59:02,413 --> 01:59:03,852
in the Lord today.

2660
01:59:03,852 --> 01:59:07,053
He has gifted me to be able
to give a wonderful message

2661
01:59:07,053 --> 01:59:09,803
and the message will encourage us today

2662
01:59:09,803 --> 01:59:12,583
that he is a possible God

2663
01:59:12,583 --> 01:59:14,705
that can do the impossible.

2664
01:59:16,393 --> 01:59:18,293
But before I deliver that message,

2665
01:59:18,293 --> 01:59:20,783
we're going to be favored by selection

2666
01:59:20,783 --> 01:59:23,203
with our choir being directed

2667
01:59:23,203 --> 01:59:24,426

Give 'em a yes in the house!

2729
02:02:58,623 --> 02:02:59,630
He is worthy.

He's worthy, come on, Zion.

02:03:03,540 --> 02:03:07,351
Come on, Zion, let him hear your yes.

2732
02:03:07,351 --> 02:03:09,356
Let him hear your yes.

2733
02:03:09,356 --> 02:03:11,189
Let him hear your yes!

2734
02:03:12,197 --> 02:03:13,812
- Yes!
- Let him hear your yes!

2735
02:03:15,213 --> 02:03:18,383
Let him hear your yes, in the house!

2736
02:03:18,383 --> 02:03:19,776
And we bless him.

2737
02:03:20,707 --> 02:03:21,806
And we bless him.

2738
02:03:23,103 --> 02:03:24,633
Thank you, choir.

2739
02:03:24,633 --> 02:03:27,273
Thank you, choir, for
that wonderful selection.

2740
02:03:27,273 --> 02:03:29,353
And we bless you all.

2741
02:03:29,353 --> 02:03:30,928
And we bless you.

2742
02:03:30,928 --> 02:03:32,345
And we bless you.

2743
02:03:33,884 --> 02:03:35,283
God, we bless you today, y'all.

2744
02:03:35,283 --> 02:03:37,843
We we thank God for who he is

2745
02:03:37,843 --> 02:03:39,643
and what he has done.

2746
02:03:39,643 --> 02:03:41,103
God is speaking to us.

2747
02:03:41,103 --> 02:03:44,593
So many of us have gone through
trials and tribulations.

2748
02:03:44,593 --> 02:03:47,373
And God is saying to
you, I've heard your cry!

2749
02:03:47,373 --> 02:03:49,863
I know exactly what you're going through.

2750
02:03:49,863 --> 02:03:51,273
And I am here

2751
02:03:51,273 --> 02:03:54,013
just like I was with
the children of Israel.

2752
02:03:54,013 --> 02:03:59,013
I am now come down, to
deliver you out of your trial,

2753
02:03:59,013 --> 02:04:01,543
to deliver you out of your tribulation.

2754
02:04:01,543 --> 02:04:02,933
Will there be one?

2755
02:04:02,933 --> 02:04:05,943
There is a voice that
God is speaking to you

2756
02:04:05,943 --> 02:04:07,963
and God is saying unto you,

2757
02:04:07,963 --> 02:04:11,933
I am your Father and you are my child.

2758
02:04:11,933 --> 02:04:14,693
He's pulling you up right here and now.

2759
02:04:14,693 --> 02:04:16,493
And he's asking you,

2760
02:04:16,493 --> 02:04:18,323
will you head the call?

2761
02:04:18,323 --> 02:04:21,393
Will you understand that He loves you

2762
02:04:21,393 --> 02:04:23,503
with an everlasting love.

2763
02:04:23,503 --> 02:04:25,563
The doors of the church are open.

2764
02:04:25,563 --> 02:04:28,263
And we're asking now, will you come?

2765
02:04:28,263 --> 02:04:30,893
Is there one?

2766
02:04:30,893 --> 02:04:34,883
Is there one, that will
hear the voice of God

2767
02:04:34,883 --> 02:04:37,103
knowing that he's speaking to you.

2768
02:04:37,103 --> 02:04:39,093
I know it's several people in here,

2769
02:04:39,093 --> 02:04:41,673
but God is speaking to you.

2770
02:04:41,673 --> 02:04:43,973
He's calling you by name.

2771
02:04:43,973 --> 02:04:47,313
He's saying my son, my
daughter, come onto me.

2772
02:04:47,313 --> 02:04:50,443
All that labor and a heavy laden,

2773
02:04:50,443 --> 02:04:53,253
I will give you rest.

2774
02:04:53,253 --> 02:04:54,353
Is there one?

2775
02:04:54,353 --> 02:04:56,743
This is safe harbor here.

2776
02:04:56,743 --> 02:04:59,163
You don't have to worry about drowning.

2777
02:04:59,163 --> 02:05:02,043
You don't have to worry about
nobody letting you fall.

2778
02:05:02,043 --> 02:05:04,243
This is a safe place.

2779
02:05:04,243 --> 02:05:05,903
This is a good place.

2780
02:05:05,903 --> 02:05:07,193
It's a wonderful place.

2781
02:05:07,193 --> 02:05:10,263
Will you come from the darkness?

2782
02:05:10,263 --> 02:05:12,383
Pastor, I don't know if I'm in darkness.

2783
02:05:12,383 --> 02:05:15,453
You're surrounded by
things you can't explain.

2784
02:05:15,453 --> 02:05:18,413
You're surrounded by things
you don't understand.

2785
02:05:18,413 --> 02:05:22,093
You cannot see from your
left, from your right.

2786
02:05:22,093 --> 02:05:25,623
God is saying, now, I
want to open your eyes.

2787
02:05:25,623 --> 02:05:28,783
I want to shine the light down on you.

2788
02:05:28,783 --> 02:05:32,223
Will you, will you hear from God

2789
02:05:32,223 --> 02:05:33,703
to walk in the light,

2790
02:05:33,703 --> 02:05:36,033
no longer walking in darkness.

2791
02:05:36,033 --> 02:05:40,573
I can't guarantee you money,
cars, houses, and land,

2792
02:05:40,573 --> 02:05:42,573
but I can guarantee you

2793
02:05:42,573 --> 02:05:44,503
that you now have a help

2794
02:05:44,503 --> 02:05:47,303
in dealing with whatever
you're dealing with.

2795
02:05:47,303 --> 02:05:50,443
Will you allow your life
to be turned around?

2796
02:05:50,443 --> 02:05:55,413
Will you allow your life now
to be turned around by God?

2797
02:05:55,413 --> 02:05:57,193
Nobody's gonna judge ya.

2798
02:05:57,193 --> 02:05:59,103
Nobody's looking at your past.

2799
02:05:59,103 --> 02:06:01,513
All God is saying,

2800
02:06:01,513 --> 02:06:03,943
I have a future for you.

2801
02:06:03,943 --> 02:06:05,843
I have a future for you.

2802
02:06:05,843 --> 02:06:07,743
Will you now go

2803
02:06:07,743 --> 02:06:11,623
from your past to the
future God has for you.

2804
02:06:11,623 --> 02:06:14,210
Now allow your life to be turned around.

2805
02:06:14,210 --> 02:06:15,293
Is there one?

2806
02:06:16,388 --> 02:06:17,221
Is there one?

2807
02:06:17,221 --> 02:06:19,793
The light is shining on you, now.

2808
02:06:19,793 --> 02:06:22,276
The light is shining on you, now.

2809
02:06:23,803 --> 02:06:25,533
Come from your darkness.

2810
02:06:25,533 --> 02:06:26,953
Come from your darkness.

2811
02:06:26,953 --> 02:06:28,513
Your darkness of hurt,

2812
02:06:28,513 --> 02:06:30,213
your darkness of pain,

2813
02:06:30,213 --> 02:06:32,136
your dark of humiliation.

2814
02:06:33,493 --> 02:06:35,393
God is speaking to you.

2815
02:06:35,393 --> 02:06:36,903
Yes, my brother.

2816
02:06:36,903 --> 02:06:38,343
Yes, my sister.

2817
02:06:38,343 --> 02:06:40,522
Is there another?

2818
02:06:40,522 --> 02:06:42,153
That's it, that's it, come on.

2819
02:06:42,153 --> 02:06:43,881
Let's celebrate.

2820
02:06:43,881 --> 02:06:44,843
Let's celebrate.

2821
02:06:44,843 --> 02:06:45,983
God has come in.

2822
02:06:45,983 --> 02:06:47,793
Is there another?

2823
02:06:47,793 --> 02:06:49,773
God is speaking to you.

2824
02:06:49,773 --> 02:06:51,965
God is saying, they're not the only ones.

2825
02:06:51,965 --> 02:06:53,573
Is there another?

2826
02:06:53,573 --> 02:06:54,436
Will you come?

2827
02:06:55,333 --> 02:06:58,213
Will you come and be with God?

2828
02:06:58,213 --> 02:06:59,926
God is commanding us.

2829
02:07:00,893 --> 02:07:03,433
He's speaking to us.

2830
02:07:03,433 --> 02:07:05,053
He's saying to us,

2831
02:07:05,053 --> 02:07:08,513
come, each and every one of you, come,

2832
02:07:08,513 --> 02:07:10,883
I have a place for you.

2833
02:07:10,883 --> 02:07:13,043
We bless your name, God.

2834
02:07:13,043 --> 02:07:15,293
We glorify you, God.

2835
02:07:15,293 --> 02:07:17,083
We thank you, God.

2836
02:07:17,083 --> 02:07:18,286
Bless you, son.

2837
02:07:19,173 --> 02:07:21,923
Thank you for coming to be with us today.

2838
02:07:21,923 --> 02:07:23,253
- Yes.
- On behalf of the church,

2839
02:07:23,253 --> 02:07:26,344
we welcome you to our church family.

2840
02:07:27,177 --> 02:07:28,551
Thank you for coming.

2841
02:07:29,643 --> 02:07:31,316
God, we bless you.
- Yes.

2842
02:07:33,103 --> 02:07:35,053
- Can I say something, pastor?
- Sure.

2843
02:07:37,903 --> 02:07:41,883
- You know, I've allowed

2844
02:07:41,883 --> 02:07:43,953
personal anger,

2845
02:07:43,953 --> 02:07:45,453
hurt and pain to

2846
02:07:46,613 --> 02:07:48,563
determine how I felt about coming here.

2847
02:07:49,963 --> 02:07:51,436
And because of that,

2848
02:07:52,273 --> 02:07:54,676
I've hurt a lot of people
that cared about me.

2849
02:07:57,043 --> 02:08:00,206
I want to apologize to everyone,

2850
02:08:02,873 --> 02:08:04,323
for the way I've been acting,

2851
02:08:05,983 --> 02:08:07,436
especially to you, Shawn.

2852
02:08:10,423 --> 02:08:13,331
I've let go of those things
I've been holding on to.

2853
02:08:13,331 --> 02:08:16,363
Thank
you, God, thank you, God.

2854
02:08:16,363 --> 02:08:17,986
- And to prove what I'm saying.

2855
02:08:24,023 --> 02:08:25,903
- Jackson, what are you doing?

2856
02:08:25,903 --> 02:08:28,930
- Something I should've
done a long time ago.

2857
02:08:31,303 --> 02:08:33,433
Pastor, with your permission.

2858
02:08:33,433 --> 02:08:34,266
- Yes.

2859
02:08:43,233 --> 02:08:45,896
- Shawn, will you marry me?

2860
02:08:46,806 --> 02:08:47,651
- Yes.

2861
02:08:48,698 --> 02:08:49,973
- Oh, praise God!

2862
02:08:49,973 --> 02:08:52,143
Praise God, praise God!

2863
02:08:52,143 --> 02:08:54,543
This is a wonderful time, in God's house.

2864
02:08:54,543 --> 02:08:56,853
It's a wonderful time, in our family.

2865
02:08:56,853 --> 02:08:59,227
Come on y'all, let's celebrate.

2866
02:08:59,227 --> 02:09:00,371
Let's celebrate.

2867
02:09:00,371 --> 02:09:02,513
Joy is in this house.

2868
02:09:02,513 --> 02:09:04,483
Love is in this house.

2869
02:09:04,483 --> 02:09:07,993
The greatest thing in
this house is forgiveness.

2870
02:09:07,993 --> 02:09:10,353
Forgiveness is in this house.

2871
02:09:10,353 --> 02:09:12,153
This is what God loves

2872
02:09:12,153 --> 02:09:15,566
and it's marvelous in his eyes.

2873
02:09:16,563 --> 02:09:17,663
- Can I say something?

2874
02:09:18,983 --> 02:09:21,033
Look, Jackson, I know I'm the last person

2875
02:09:21,033 --> 02:09:23,133
you want to see right now.

2876
02:09:23,133 --> 02:09:25,323
I mean, I disrespected your home.

2877
02:09:25,323 --> 02:09:26,276
You, as a man.

2878
02:09:27,743 --> 02:09:28,823
I embarrassed my wife.

2879
02:09:28,823 --> 02:09:29,666
- Yes, you did.

2880
02:09:31,343 --> 02:09:32,176
- The church.

2881
02:09:33,743 --> 02:09:36,056
And for that, man, I'm deeply sorry.

2882
02:09:37,303 --> 02:09:40,986
So I humble myself to ask
you for your forgiveness.

2883
02:09:42,743 --> 02:09:45,020
Will you forgive me, Jackson?

2884
02:09:49,543 --> 02:09:50,376
- I forgive you, man.

2885
02:09:50,376 --> 02:09:51,613
- Aw, man.

2886
02:09:51,613 --> 02:09:53,503
- Amen, come on, y'all.

2887
02:09:53,503 --> 02:09:54,943
Let's give God praise.

2888
02:09:54,943 --> 02:09:57,980
This is what forgiveness
is like in the flesh

2889
02:09:57,980 --> 02:09:59,593
and we bless God

2890
02:09:59,593 --> 02:10:01,404
and we celebrate.

2891
02:10:01,404 --> 02:10:05,543
We celebrate, it's a
joyous time in our family.

2892
02:10:05,543 --> 02:10:08,233
It's a joyous time in our church.

2893
02:10:08,233 --> 02:10:10,253
And we thank God for this.

2894
02:10:10,253 --> 02:10:11,443
Come on, saints.

2895
02:10:11,443 --> 02:10:14,506
Clap your hands and
bless God for this sign.
