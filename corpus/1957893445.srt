You are in sixth grade now,

has added responsibility.

00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,944
So, up here on the board,

22
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,238

to write down your homework

00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,240

00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,566
- MAN: Hello.
- (door closes)

182
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,026
PAUL:
Grandpa.

183
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:31,069
- Hey, young man.
- Hey. Hey, Grandpa.

184
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,863
- Hugga-mugga. (chuckles)
- (Paul grunts)

185
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,573
♪ Tumbalalaika, tumba... ♪

186
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,116
How you doing? Okay?

187
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,493
- Good.
- Good.

188
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,369
- So, check this baby out.
- What's that?

189
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,746
- New one?
- It's... Yeah.

190
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,916
Captain United.
I made my own superhero.

191
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,627
Hey.

192
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,254
- Hey, that's great.
- (chuckles)

193
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,215
Flying high over the city.

194
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:52,633
Hey, you're good.

195
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,593
This is really impressive.
You know that?

196
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,428
- Thank you, my good man.
- Good for you.

197
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,471
- (chuckles)
- Good for y...

198
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:58,847
That's wonderful.

199
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,349
Uh, oh, by the way,

200
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,309
- I got some jelly beans.
- Oh.

201
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,228
- Shh. Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

202
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,604
(Grandpa chuckles)

203
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,231
Ma says I can't eat 'em.

204
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,774
- They're bad for my teeth.
- Oh, get out of here.

205
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,400
I've been eating jelly beans
all my life.

206
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,568
And look at my teeth.

207
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,612
They're perfect.

208
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,280
(chuckles)

209
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,032
- Hey, Grandpa?
- What?

210
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,243
I think I want to be
a famous artist when I grow up.

211
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,119
Oh. You want to be famous,

212
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,996
you can do what you like,
but if you're gonna be famous,

213
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,957
you got to sign
the drawings first.

214
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,292
All the great artists
sign their work. Go and do it.

215
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,127
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

216
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,171
GRANDPA:
Yeah.

217
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:34,591
I heard that, uh, today was
your first day at school.

218
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,134
Is that right?

219
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,636
Yes, indeed.

220
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,930
- I hung out with my friend Johnny.
- Yeah?

221
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,975
And we're going to the
Guggenheim Museum next week.

222
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,810
- The Giggly-heim. Okay, good.
- (chuckles)

223
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,770
Very nice. Um...

224
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,856
I just remembered
we talked about something.

225
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,941
What the heck was it?
We talked... Do you remember?

226
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,943
Oh, yes. I remember.
We talked about

227
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,987
a "going back to school"
present, yeah?

228
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,823
Go and look in the bag.

229
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,491
(rummaging)

230
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,909
PAUL:
Holy cow.

231
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,828
The rocket! You got it.

232
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,580
- Do you like it?
- That's amazing!

233
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,206
- Can we make it?
- Yeah.

234
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,500
We'll go to Flushing Meadow,
and we'll launch it.

235
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,002
First steps first.

236
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,420
You know, they're coming over
for dinner,

237
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,921
so, um, don't tell your mama.

238
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,799
This is our secret project,
okay?

239
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,676
Got it, Grandpa.

240
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,178
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

241
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,473
PAUL (fading): This is the one
that went to the moon, Grandpa.

242
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,017
RUTH:
Oh, my God!

243
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,768
- G-G-Get... get it away!
- TED: It's a ham...

244
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,145
- That thing, i-it's a rat!
- No, it's a hamster.

245
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,730
- She's not gonna hurt you.
- In the house!

246
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,023
- It's a rat. It's a rat!
- It's-it's not a rat.

247
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,858
- It's a hamster, Aunt Ruth.
- Get it...

248
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,067
- Get that thing away!
- It's from a science project.

249
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,777
- Look, I'll put it on...
- Aah! My God!

250
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,362
- Get it out of here!
- It's not gonna hurt...

251
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,197
- It's not gonna hurt you.
- Get it the hell out of here!

252
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,824
- Ruthie, please, it's just the kids' pet.
- RUTH: Stop it!

253
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,200
I'm putting it away.
I'm putting it away.

254
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,243
We had enough of those
growing up, Mickey.

255
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,536
Hey, Grandpa.

256
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,246
- Hey. How you doing?
- PAUL: Seriously?

257
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,372
What are you reading?

258
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,916
- What's that?
- Hey, you.

259
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,876
- Stop.
- What's the rocket?

260
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,544
It's for school.

261
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,296
You mean fake school?

262
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:55,923
You actually have to work
at my school

263
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,549
and get real punishment.

264
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,217
Ask me if I care, Ted.

265
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,053
ESTHER: All right, everybody,
get ready for dinner.

266
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,722
IRVING (grunts):
Well, it's not the compressor.

267
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,557
(radio playing indistinctly)

268
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,267
Irving, I need my oven.

269
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,519
IRVING:
Esther, I have to fix this.

270
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,854
What's going on here?

271
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,648
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

272
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,149
- I don't know the story.
- What's happening?

273
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,609
IRVING:
Aaron, maybe you could...

274
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,985
maybe you could help me
with this.

275
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,779
I'm trying to figure out
why it's making

276
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,572
this grinding sound.

277
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,282
And, uh, I think maybe

278
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,284
- the Freon... Freon lines...
- (Grandpa stammering)

279
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,078
- ESTHER: Dad, watch your suit.
- GRANDPA: Yeah.

280
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,830
There's a defrost timer.
Try that.

281
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,917
- The defrost timer?
- Yeah.

282
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,920
- What you need?
- Can you get me my socket set?

283
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,421
- (making whooshing noises)
- (indistinct chatter)

284
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,757
- What are you doing?
- Ow! Why'd you do that?

285
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,801
- Because I felt like it.
- Stop, you idiot!

286
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,260
Yeah, whatever, shithead.

287
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,262
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

288
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,347
- Um...
- PAUL: Ma?

289
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,516
Ted pinged my ear.

290
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,434
- Ma!
- What? I heard you.

291
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,811
So?

292
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,938
And you're totally innocent,
I'm sure.

293
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,940
- Yes, I am!
- (mocking): "But I am, Ma."

294
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,109
- Yes. I... (sighs)
- "Yes."

295
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,277
- (Esther babbling mockingly)
- I am innocent, Ma!

296
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,407
- (smooching)
- (Paul gagging)

297
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,034
How was school, buster?

298
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,369
- It was fine.
- Yeah?

299
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,787
I have Mr. Turkeltaub.

300
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,163
- Can you sign a permission slip?
- Hmm?

301
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,957
We're going on a class trip
next week.

302
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,960
- Ah.
- Into the city with my friends.

303
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:19,339
Guess whose mother already
did it in my school meeting.

304
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,966
- Ma?
- Yeah?

305
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,010
How much power
do you have at school?

306
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,887
Like, do you run everything
or...

307
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,222
(snickers)

308
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,557
(laughing)

309
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,142
ESTHER (laughing):
No.

310
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:32,811
No, I'm the president
of the PTA. Why?

311
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,646
- Mm. Just wondering.
- Hmm.

312
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,231
What is that?

313
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,692
It's a type of fish.
It's very nice.

314
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,652
It's called scrod.

315
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,196
Well, I'm definitely
not eating scrod.

316
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,906
Look, what does it matter
what it's called?

317
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,034
It flakes.
That means it's fresh.

318
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,618
- Like fresh doggy doo.
- Hey.

319
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,120
I'll just eat the spaghetti

320
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,457
and order dumplings
from Fan Fan for delivery.

321
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,167
Don't you dare. Don't you dare.

322
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,710
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

323
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,045
I have made plenty of food.

324
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,504
You're not ordering dumplings.

325
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,839
We'll soon see about that.

326
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,090
Excuse me?

327
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,884
Hey, jelly bean, come here.

328
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,261
Eat this.

329
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,263
Have this.

330
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,389
Behave yourself.

331
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,974
Don't give your mother
a hard time.

332
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,185
- (Paul grunts)
- Now, get out of here.

333
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,561
Tell your brother
to behave, too.

334
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,980
PAUL:
Okay.

335
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,482
IRVING:
Now, I like the Throgs Neck.

336
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,858
- I like the suspension bridge.
- (slurping)

337
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,401
ESTHER:
Don't slurp.

338
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,236
IRVING: The Kosciuszko Bridge
is a nice bridge.

339
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,988
- It's a comely bridge.
- Don't slurp.

340
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,116
For me, a truss bridge
is-is the best bridge.

341
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,534
- ALL: A truss bridge?
- IRVING: A truss bridge.

342
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,036
I thought that's what you wear
around your back.

343
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,205
GRANDPA:
Here. Bloody worms.

344
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,083
IRVING: A truss bridge of,
uh, interconnected triangles,

345
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:40,170
and a triangle cannot
be distorted by stress,

346
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,964
- so it's perfectly load-bearing.
- (Ted chuckling)

347
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,257
LOUIS: You know, we go over
the Kosciuszko...

348
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,801
IRVING:
What are you laughing about?

349
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,552
Your father's making
a really good point.

350
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,221
It's perfectly load-bearing.
It's not distorted by stress.

351
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,388
ESTHER: I actually have
a little announcement.

352
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,057
RUTH:
Esther would like to talk.

353
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,475
(clears throat)

354
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,061
I've decided
with, uh, your support

355
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,605
that I'm gonna run
for the district school board.

356
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,398
- GRANDMA: Oh, that's wonderful.
- (clapping)

357
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,650
Wonderful.

358
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,778
ESTHER:
Thank you. Okay, okay.

359
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,738
You gonna win?

360
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,282
With your support, yeah,
yeah, I might.

361
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,076
(chuckles) It sounds like
you're not gonna.

362
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,911
(Ted laughs)

363
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,746
I said I needed your support,
not rude comments, all right?

364
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,373
Did you hear what he said to me?

365
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:19,334
Hey, don't make yourself
objectionable for once, okay?

366
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,253
Wipe your face. Wipe your face.

367
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,963
GRANDMA:
Esther, dear,

368
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,756
why would you run
for the school board

369
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,591
with Teddy in private school?

370
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,176
ESTHER:
For Paul's sake.

371
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,095
And to make a difference
in the community.

372
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,514
GRANDMA: I'm sorry, I think
that's absolutely crazy.

373
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,599
Paulie should be
in Ted's school anyway.

374
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,101
And we can help.

375
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,185
- Can't we, Aaron?
- GRANDPA: Yeah, we can help.

376
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,353
GRANDMA:
Absolutely.

377
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,188
He's fine where he is now, Ma.

378
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,982
GRANDMA: I'm just saying
that the public school system

379
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,442
is just not what it was
when we taught there.

380
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,694
Am I right?

381
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,195
GRANDPA:
It's changed, I guess.

382
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,281
Grandma, I like school.

383
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,408
All my friends are there.

384
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,994
My dear boy, you will be able
to make friends everywhere.

385
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,453
Let me tell you something.

386
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,455
The class sizes there
are out of control,

387
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,791
and they are now
bringing kids in

388
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,793
from all over
those neighborhoods.

389
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,086
The Blacks are coming in...

390
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,297
- Ma!
- GRANDMA: I'm sorry.

391
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,965
Come on.
They got nowhere else to go.

392
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,383
Their schools are broken.

393
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,177
He should be going
to private school, Aaron.

394
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,179
- RUTH: I don't believe this.
- GRANDMA: You know that.

395
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,222
RUTH:
These are my kiddush cups.

396
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,224
I brought them back
from Czechoslovakia.

397
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,893
GRANDMA:
Congratulations.

398
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,686
You were in Czechoslovakia,
Aunt Ruth?

399
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,229
Yes.

400
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,107
I worked for the Pentagon
right after the war.

401
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:29,029
I was relocating
displaced persons in Prague.

402
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,989
TED:
That's so cool.

403
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,991
Your great-aunt is
a very impressive person.

404
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,327
I went into this
thrift store there,

405
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,495
and I saw all these
kiddush cups.

406
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,207
Then I looked at
the bottom of the cups,

407
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,043
- and I saw all these names.
- Wow.

408
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,670
I knew they were stolen
from Jews

409
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,297
that went to the camps.

410
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,424
- I almost fell over.
- (coughing)

411
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,675
(Irving gags)

412
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:53,720
(gasping, gagging)

413
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,847
(Paul and Ted laughing)

414
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,683
RUTH:
What are you laughing at?

415
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,268
How can you laugh at that?

416
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,978
What are you laughing at?

417
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,438
RUTH:
How can you kids...

418
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,440
The Nazis took 'em to the camps.

419
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,901
Esther, they're laughing
about Nazis.

420
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:10,028
- Irving.
- RUTH: That's not funny.

421
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,863
- IRVING: Behave.
- RUTH: What are you...

422
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,323
- What are you laughing at?
- Behave!

423
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,325
- ESTHER: Aah! Irving.
- RUTH: That's not funny.

424
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,327
- That's all. Eat the meat.
- ESTHER: No, no, no, no, no.

425
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,329
- I don't want to hear any reasons.
- IRVING: Here.

426
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,623
ESTHER: There's no excuse
for that. I'm so sorry.

427
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,083
You're gonna catch
your father's temper.

428
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,876
GRANDPA:
It's not funny.

429
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,212
I can't see why we just don't
have dumplings every night.

430
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,172
This is disgusting.

431
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,632
ESTHER:
It's not disgusting.

432
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,759
And we can't have dumplings
every night,

433
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,052
because then we'd never have

434
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,553
a single dollar
for anything else.

435
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,305
- IRVING: Eat it.
- You know what I teach, buddy?

436
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,556
I teach home economics.

437
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,975
All right?
You know what that means?

438
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,268
It means I teach
how to stay on a budget.

439
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,519
- All right?
- IRVING: What did I say?

440
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,145
- ESTHER: He has no idea.
- IRVING: Eat it.

441
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,272
ESTHER: He has no idea
the meaning of a dollar.

442
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,606
He has no idea how hard we work.

443
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,566
He just...
he does not get it at all.

444
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,401
(mock babbling)

445
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,403
Hey, stop that. No, no.

446
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,822
(sighs) Dumplings, suckers.

447
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,992
ESTHER: Paul, what are you...
Don't you dare.

448
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,910
Paul, don't you dare.

449
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,203
- Paul, what are you doing?
- Hey.

450
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,454
Hey, get me some fried.

451
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,498
No. What, now you
don't like dinner?

452
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,417
- TED: It's got all this water in it, Ma.
- No, it doesn't.

453
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:07,252
TED: It's slipping
and sliding on the plate. Look.

454
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,587
ESTHER: No, it doesn't!
It's just like Antonio's.

455
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,214
- TED: It's not.
- ESTHER: Paul?

456
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,549
Paul, don't you dial
that num... Irving.

457
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,092
IRVING:
Hang up the phone right now.

458
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,844
No ching chang cho food
tonight, okay?

459
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:17,512
- ESTHER: Paul?
- You stop! Your mother made dinner.

460
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,139
ESTHER: I am not joking
right now, okay?

461
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,348
- Put down the phone.
- Paul, hang up the phone.

462
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,850
- Paul, put the phone down.
- Paul.

463
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,268
- Do not order that...
- Paul, put down the phone!

464
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,020
- Paul?
- ESTHER: Have some respect.

465
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:26,896
- IRVING: I'm warning you. Hang it up.
- ♪ Hey, Mama ♪

466
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,440
- ♪ Your pasta ain't so great. ♪
- Put the phone down!

467
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,816
- IRVING: You, too. Sit down.
- (all clamoring)

468
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,526
You're gonna wind up with it
all over the rug.

469
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,194
Hey, you shut up. You stop it.

470
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,362
...one order
roast pork fried rice.

471
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,530
IRVING:
Put down the phone!

472
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,948
And one order fried dumplings.

473
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,283
ESTHER:
Paul, put down the phone!

474
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,160
- Hey, put the...
- IRVING: Oh!

475
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,786
Goddamn it!

476
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,205
What did I say?

477
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,791
I am gonna rap you one!

478
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,919
- 175-2374th Avenue.
- (others murmuring)

479
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,254
I'm gonna get a towel.

480
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,589
- I'm so sorry.
- LOUIS: No, don't worry.

481
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,299
It's good.
Just a little bit of sauce...

482
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,801
No, actually two order
fried dumplings.

483
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,138
...if we don't do it now,
if we let this be

484
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,473
another Sodom and Gomorrah,
that...

485
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,974
GRANDMA:
Terrible governor.

486
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,476
...maybe we might be

487
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:05,977
the generation
that sees Armageddon?

488
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,687
What a schmuck.

489
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,064
ESTHER: Hey, does anybody want
the Chinese leftovers?

490
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,732
Otherwise,
I'm gonna throw 'em out.

491
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,984
No, no, d-don't throw 'em away.
I'll eat 'em.

492
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,487
(sighs):
Okay.

493
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,905
GRANDPA:
Hey, you okay?

494
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,490
- Hmm?
- You dizzy or something?

495
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,533
Oh. No, no, no, no, no.
I just have a headache.

496
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,202
- You got a headache?
- Yeah.

497
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,787
Okay. Come here.

498
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,205
I have a knee ache,
and you got a headache.

499
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,706
(both laugh)

500
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,500
- Hey, let's have a dance.
- We're quite a pair.

501
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,335
- (Esther laughs)
- (hums a tune)

502
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:32,587
- GRANDPA: Fantastic.
- (both laugh)

503
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,048
- (Esther groans softly)
- Hey, you're gonna be okay.

504
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,176
These kids could
drive you nuts, though.

505
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,685
(door opens)

506
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,354
GRANDPA:
Hey, you.

507
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:52,190
- Why don't you go to sleep?
- (sets book aside)

508
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,818
Mm, can you stay with me?

509
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:57,445
Oh, you know, someday
you may not want me here.

510
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,364
That will never happen.

511
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:02,742
I don't know. You're already
giving your mother...

512
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,702
a hard time.

513
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,205
PAUL:
Hmm.

514
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,790
Why do you do that?

515
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,708
Huh?

516
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,168
(sighs)

517
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,504
- Hey, Grandpa?
- What?

518
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:17,966
Today, when you said
the spaghetti was bloody worms,

519
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,427
- what did you mean?
- Oh, that.

520
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:24,222
Well, my mother, you know,
when we came over here,

521
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,976
uh, to America,
through Ellis Island,

522
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:31,396
uh, they served spaghetti there
on Ellis Island.

523
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,565
And my mother thought
it was, uh, worms.

524
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,235
She said, "Ach, they just...
worms, bloody worms."

525
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,405
So she wouldn't have it
in the house.

526
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,449
Yeah, I could see that.

527
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,869
But then why'd she come here?

528
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,707
'Cause they wanted to kill her.
That's why.

529
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,501
Who would?

530
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,920
Uh...

531
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,299
she was born and raised
in a small town

532
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,093
called Ostropil
in, uh, the Ukraine.

533
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,846
And her parents had a store
there in the main street.

534
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,140
It was a shop, and, uh...

535
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,683
But there were troops
of soldiers

536
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,602
in the garrison who were drunk

537
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,981
and Cossacks who were crazy,
always were.

538
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,233
And sometimes they'd go out
looking for Jews.

539
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,695
They'd say,
"We're looking for the Jews."

540
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,491
And one night,
they rode into the town,

541
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,827
and, um, they broke into
her parents' store,

542
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,040
and, uh, they stabbed
both of them for no reason.

543
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,292
They stabbed both of them
to death right there

544
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,461
in front of my mama, and, uh...
(scoffs)

545
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,296
She was a young girl.
She was 15, 16.

546
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,383
She told me she had nightmares
about it as long as she lived.

547
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,802
She said you should never,
ever forget the past

548
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:47,305
because you never know when
they may come looking for you.

549
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,226
And she... she was right.

550
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,061
Yeah.

551
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,771
But she survived. She got away.

552
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,773
She got out.
She left her country.

553
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,901
She left the Ukraine,
and she was unstoppable.

554
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,362
She got through Poland
and Denmark, I think,

555
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,072
and then to Liverpool.

556
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:07,535
(chuckles) That's where
The Beatles are from.

557
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,996

558
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,166
Anyway, she met, uh,
my father then,

559
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:18,836
and they got married
and they had me, and, uh...

560
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,172
So she said,
"Okay, come on, let's go."

561
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,592
And we got on the boat and we
came over here to America.

562
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,012

superhero painting

What's her name, Golda?

863
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,306
- GRANDMA: Goldie Hawn.
- Goldie Hawn.

864
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,266
- She was excellent.
- Yeah.

865
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:45,684
(groaning):
Oh, God.

866
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,269
- GRANDMA: What is it?
- (Ted laughs)

867
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,604
- PAUL: Stop! Stop!
- GRANDPA: It's my leg.

868
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,481
- Okay, okay. Enough.
- You're so annoying!

869
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,441

- Enough. That...

Show me where. Show me.
Show me. I don't understand.

872
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,780
- Is it a sharp pain, or is it just...
- Grandpa?

873
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,490
It's down in the shins,
and I can't feel my feet.

874
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,533
- What happened?
- I'm okay, jelly bean.

875
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,744
- Dad?
- No, it's there, there down in the shin. Yeah.

GRANDMA: We're gonna wrap it
in ice and get some...

877
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,122
You all right? Is he all right?

878
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,707
Whoa, whoa, big guy. You okay?

He says I got arthritis.

corner. I'm gonna go get it.

- You got to be careful.

884
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:17,883
I'm being careful.
Stop fussing.

885
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,343
You're all fussing around me.

I think I want to be an artist

I'm gonna give you a wonderful

called The Art of Success.

908

That's the only art you need
to concern yourself with.

909
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,363
You study something
you can fall back on.

910
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,657
Like, uh...
like computer graphics.

911
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,201

- IRVING: Now, that's a growth industry.

912

That's a job.

913
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,915
MR. TURKELTAUB:
I know how inspired

914
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,917
we all were by our trip
to the Guggenheim

915
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:36,420
and seeing those paintings
by Kandinsky.

916
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:41,049
So, today, we're gonna try
our very own art project.

917
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,178
Right? So, you find a word,

918
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,180
a word that is a noun.

919
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:47,681
You all know what a noun is.

920
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,892
STUDENTS:
A person, place or a thing.

921
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,935
- BOY: That ends in...
- GIRL: That ends in L-Y.

922
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,187
No, no, no. (chuckles)

923
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,564
No L-Y. That's an adverb.

924
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,816
So, you take a word
that is a noun...

925
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,943
(voice fading):
and you write it out in letters

926
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,070
made up of that exact thing.

927
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,156
So I want you to...

928
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,366
(laughter)

929
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,202
- For example, books.
- Oh, my God. -Look at Johnny.

930
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:11,498
Books, Mr. Davis, something
you don't know anything about.

931
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,124
Fuck you, Turkey.

932
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,834
- (students gasp)
- Get up.

933
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,169
Get over there.

934
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,462
Go on. Go, go, go.

935
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,214
You are not doing this project.

936
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,340
You're just gonna sit there!

937
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,966
Fine by me.

938
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,429
MR. TURKELTAUB: You're just
gonna sit right there.

939
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:36,230
Now, all the paper should be
covered with a color.

940
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,690
All right?
And use your imaginations.

941
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,734
And be...

942
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,029
- original.
- STUDENTS: Original.

943
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,328
MR. TURKELTAUB: Color
the drawings, not the desk.

944
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,090
(Mr. Turkeltaub clears throat)

945
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,717
What's this?

946
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,639
Uh, it's a Kandinsky.

947
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,433
Stand up.

948
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:16,062
All right. (sighs)

949
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:20,524
Class, we went to the museum.

950
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,110
Who saw paintings like this?

951
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:25,529
I remember. That's a copy.

952
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,364
MR. TURKELTAUB:
Now, what did I say to you,

953
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,408
Mr. Graff, about doing
your own work here?

954
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,034
Look, this is a copy.

955
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,495
And it's not the assignment,
so you weren't listening.

956
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,873
- The drawing's excellent, man.
- (students gasp)

957
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,418
Mr. Davis, I didn't ask you.

958
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,877
That's 'cause you're
a goddamn turkey

959
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,838
- and I'll fuck you up!
- (students gasping)

960
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:44,715
MR. TURKELTAUB: All right.
That's it! That's it! Right...

961
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:46,967
Right to Mr. Sebell's
right now!

962
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:49,845
- (students murmuring)
- (door opens)

963
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:51,556
(door bangs shut)

964
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:56,351
MR. TURKELTAUB:
These are Cuisenaire rods.

965
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,062
Okay?

966
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:02,899
Okay, so now you put
the green rod

967
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:07,237
on the number six row
with the "A" column.

968
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,490
Okay? Green rod, number six row.

969
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,161
I need a piece of graph paper.

970
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,747
Forget it.
You're too far behind now.

971
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:19,958
You can either sit quietly
or clean up the paintbrushes.

972
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,628
Up to you.

973
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,340
Oh.

974
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,801
Good, Mr. Davis,
helping out for a change.

975
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,554
All right, who'd like to go on
cleanup duty and, uh, help out?

976
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,724
Who'd like to volunteer?

977
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,517
Oh, look, his buddy Paul.

978
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,269
Don't take too long.

979
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,063
- Now...
- PAUL: Hey.

980
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:43,523
- Thanks for sticking up for me.
- Yeah, man.

981
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,525
How'd it go with you?
Did you get in trouble?

982
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,277
No. I was down there
for a while,

983
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,654
and nobody even come talk to me.

984
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:50,280
- Huh.
- Not the whole time.

985
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,782
So I just come back up.

986
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,035
- Wow.
- Check this out.

987
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,371
What is that?

988
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,705
My cousin gave it to me.

989
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,290
He said you smoke 'em,

990
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,958
you just, like, laugh and laugh.

991
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,418
(both chuckle)

992
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,253
So, you gonna do it?

993
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,963
- Like, now?
- Yeah, man.

994
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,842
Suck it in.
It's made of tea and shit.

995
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,471

In here.

996
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:20,727

- How dare you!
- Shit.

1009
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,472
You're a menace!
A menace, the two of you!

1010
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,809
That's unbelievable!
Go! Get out!

1011
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,021
PRINCIPAL SEBELL:
Paul, do you know

1012
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,066
what was in that cigarette?

1013
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,861
Young man, what you
were smoking is illegal,

1014
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,446
and you could go to jail.

1015
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:14,699
Now, is that what you want?

1016
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,037
Would you please answer him?

1017
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,834
No, obviously not.

1018
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:27,920
ESTHER:
Principal Sebell.

1019
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,843
I can promise you he had
no idea what he was doing.

1020
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:36,803
We don't have anything
like that in our house,

1021
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,139
and, uh, he wasn't the one
who brought it into the school.

1022
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,308
And...

1023
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,978
I think it's incumbent
upon the school

1024
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,481
not only to look at class size...

1025
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,399
Take a good, long look
at class size...

1026
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,235
But also who is in what class.

1027
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,362
Mrs. Graff...

1028
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,365
I know you're thinking about
running for the district board,

1029
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:01,746
but have you ever thought about
remedial classes for Paul?

1030
00:43:03,623 --> 00:43:05,624
ESTHER:
Remedial?

1031
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,209
PRINCIPAL SEBELL:
Yes.

1032
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,753
It might be an option
for you and your family

1033
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:12,255
moving forward, because...

1034
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,217
he may be a bit slow.

1035
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:21,973
My son is not slow.

1036
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,600
No, sir.

1037
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,018
PRINCIPAL SEBELL:
Mrs. Graff...

1038
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,979
ESTHER:
No, I've heard enough.

1039
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,232
Get up. Time to go.

1040
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,822
(muffled, indistinct chatter)

1041
00:43:37,532 --> 00:43:39,784
(door opens)

1042
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,917
(distorted laughing)

1043
00:43:48,918 --> 00:43:51,212
- (door bangs shut)
- (snapping fingers)

1044
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,881
What were you thinking?!

1045
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,341
How could you do that?

1046
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:57,843
- Huh?
- (sighs): Oh, my God.

1047
00:43:57,844 --> 00:43:59,803
How am I supposed to know
it's against the law, Ma?

1048
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,180
- Oh, my God.
- Besides, it's fine.

1049
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,849
You're the president
of the school.

1050
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,017
No, I'm not. I am in the PTA,
for God's sa...

1051
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,019
I don't even think
I can run for the board

1052
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,604
or anything else
after this little episode.

1053
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,523
Thank you.

1054
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,024
Okey doke.

1055
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,110
No, it's not okey doke.
Okey dokey?

1056
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,903
This is not
a respectful response.

1057
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,530
- Where did you learn this disrespect?
- Stop.

1058
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,324
- Ow!
- What?!

1059
00:44:25,872 --> 00:44:27,957
Where did you get
that cigarette?

1060
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,917
Hmm?

1061
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,669
Did that Black boy
that was sitting there...

1062
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,671
did he give it to you?

1063
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,673
Well, you're not to associate
with him again.

1064
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,425
What do you mean? Why?

1065
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:39,926
I think you know what I mean.

1066
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,928
- You mean 'cause he's Black?
- S-Stop it.

1067
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,140
- I hung out with him last year, too, if you care.
- Stop it.

1068
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,350
(mouthing)

1069
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:48,977
It's not 'cause he's Black.

1070
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:50,854
All right, he could be
green or purple

1071
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,606
or orange, for all I care.

1072
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:56,401
The principal said
that he was held back.

1073
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,194
So?

1074
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,779
(Esther sighs)

1075
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,072
That means he's not very bright.

1076
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,158
- No, it doesn't.
- Yes, it does.

1077
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,743
- He's super smart and really...
- (stammers) I can't with you.

1078
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,244
- You just don't know him.
- I can't...

1079
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,913
- Your father's gonna have to deal with you.
- What?

1080
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:09,623
Your father's gonna
have to deal with you.

1081
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,583
Why? What's he gonna do?

1082
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,376
Guess, genius.

1083
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,878
I'm done sticking up for you.

1084
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,630
Ma? Ma, wait.

1085
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,173
(thunder rumbling)

1086
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,217
Ma! Ma!

1087
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,721
ESTHER:
Irving? Irving?

1088
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,848
- Please don't.
- I need to talk to you.

1089
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,434
IRVING:
What?

1090
00:45:35,316 --> 00:45:36,984
(lock clicking)

1091
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,909
(panting)

1092
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,912
(Esther and Irving shouting
indistinctly in distance)

1093
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,759
(footsteps rapidly approaching)

1094
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,970
(doorknob rattling)

1095
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:06,430
IRVING:
Open the door.

1096
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,349
I can't.

1097
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,934
Paul...

1098
00:46:10,935 --> 00:46:13,269
(door rattling)

1099
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,813
Open the door.

1100
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:16,982
- You'll hit me, Dad.
- Open it up!

1101
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:18,775
I'm not doing it.

1102
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,944
Your mother just said
you and some Black kid

1103
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,904
were smoking drugs in school?

1104
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,739
- I didn't know what it was.
- (door banging)

1105
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,243
IRVING:
Open the goddamn door!

1106
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,661
(crying)

1107
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,454
Please.

1108
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,456
You're gonna get it, kid.

1109
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,542
You are gonna get it.

1110
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,752
- (Paul yells)
- Come here!

1111
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,962
Stop!

1112
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,797
- (Irving grunts)
- (sobs)

1113
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,049
Stop! Please stop.

1114
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,926
- The hell is the matter with you?
- Please!

1115
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,138
- (sobbing)
- Get up!

1116
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,140
Please.

1117
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,600
S-Stop.

1118
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,310
Please stop.

1119
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,229
(coughs)

1120
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,772
(whimpers)

1121
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,401
(sobbing softly)

1122
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,656
That's enough. Stop crying.

1123
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,826
Stop blubbering.

1124
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:12,871
The hell are you laughing at?!

1125
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:14,164
There's not a single
goddamn thing

1126
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:15,665
that's amusing about this.

1127
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,334
Get out of here, you asshole!

1128
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:23,131
IRVING:
Get cleaned up for dinner.

1129
00:47:23,132 --> 00:47:26,176
And-and wash your teeth after
with the Waterpik.

1130
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:28,429
Your breath
is like trench mouth.

1131
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,431
I hate you.

1132
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:33,184
I hate this family.

1133
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,438
What did you say?

1134
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,065
Nothing.

1135
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,025
- What did you say to me?
- Nothing.

1136
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:43,777
What did you say to me?

1137
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,695
I said nothing. (yells)

1138
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,697
- What did you say?!
- Nothing!

1139
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,449
What did you say to me?!

1140
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:50,658
Nothing!

1141
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,951
- Huh?
- Nothing.

1142
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,369
IRVING:
What did you say to me?!

1143
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,705
- (thumping)
- PAUL: Aah! Nothing.

1144
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,875
Nothing. I promise.

1145
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,212
(whimpers, coughs)

1146
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,717
You made me break
the goddamn door.

1147
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,929
(panting)

1148
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,099
(crying softly)

1149
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,062
Someday he'll learn he's not

1150
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,357
the smartest kid
on planet Earth.

1151
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,276
ESTHER: I've had it
with that school, Irving.

1152
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,571
He needs a place
with real discipline.

1153
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,741
We need to send him
to Ted's school now.

1154
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,243
No way.

1155
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:35,036
I'm not changing schools.

1156
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,080
- Uh-uh. Sorry, buddy.
- You think that's smart?

1157
00:48:37,081 --> 00:48:38,832
You think that's smart?
Say another word.

1158
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:40,458
Do it. Do it.

1159
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,253
You don't get to call
the shots around here.

1160
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,338
Okay? I call the shots.

1161
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,632
You understand me?
You understand me?

1162
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,260
I call the shots.

1163
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:55,181
Things are gonna be different
around here.

1164
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,933
And your friend's from hunger.

1165
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:59,103
You're not gonna talk
to him anymore.

1166
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:03,065
(whispers):
I hate this family.

1167

Hey. Checking in on you.

1170

Hey. How-how did you know
where I live?

1171
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:34,304
From that chart they had on you.

1172
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,097
It had all the information.

1173
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:39,268
Well... just come here.

1174
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,063
This is my clubhouse.

JOHNNY: Whoa.
You could just move in here.

1176
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:50,486
Yeah. My dad built it for me
a couple years ago.

1177
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:54,782
Your dad built
this whole thing for you?

1178

- PAUL: Mm.
- JOHNNY: Wow.

1179
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:59,580
When he wasn't in
an asshole mood.

1180
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,666
It's got a window
and everything.

1181
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:06,337
Yeah, it's a good place
to hang out, I guess.

1182
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,216
What's this?

1183
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:14,303
Um, Johnny?

1184
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:19,767
M-My parents are gonna try to
send me to my brother's school.

1185
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,186
Wow. That sucks.

1186
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:25,271
But I'm gonna try
and get my grandpa

1187
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,565
to change their minds, maybe.

1188
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,817
Yeah, I hope he does.

1189
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,737
I hope he does, too.

1190
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,364
What about you?

1191
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:35,990
They sent me up
to the third floor

1192
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,575
with, like, all the retards.

1193
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,078
So I decided
I'm cutting out for good.

1194
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,955
Do my own thing.

1195
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,707
That's so cool.

1196
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,711
Yeah, so...

1197
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,714
I'll be seeing you, I guess.

1198
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:55,218
Hey, I'm going to that

1199
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:57,053
Sugarhill Gang concert
next week.

1200
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,596
You want to catch that?

1201
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,139
Next Monday night?

1202
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,600
- For sure.
- Excellent.

1203
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,519
If you're not back at school,
I'll find you

1204
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,729
at the other place
at the end of the day.

1205
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,147
What's that called?

1206
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,774
Forest Manor.

1207
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,735
Forest Manor, yeah.

1208
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,570
The show's gonna be special.

1209
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,532
Mm. Good luck.

1210
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,159
Thanks.

1211
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,078
GRANDMA:
Not too much, Aaron.

1212
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,997
Are you coming with the bagels?

1213
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:25,123
GRANDMA:
She's coming, Irv.

1214
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:26,291
She's coming.

1215
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:28,042
(sighing):
Okay, okay.

1216
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,669
I don't know
what everybody wants,

1217
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,130
- so you just have to choose.
- Thank you. -Beautiful.

1218
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:33,756
Paul, your waffles will be out
in a second, okay?

1219
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,342
TED: Of course, he couldn't eat
what everybody else eats.

1220
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,760
ESTHER:
Leave him alone.

1221
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,637
He's in a mood.

1222
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,556
You put me in a mood.

1223
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:43,891
Trying to make me
change schools.

1224
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,103
But I'm not going, so...

1225
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,272
RUTH:
Eat something.

1226
00:51:49,273 --> 00:51:50,982
- I'll take some.
- IRVING: It's not bad.

1227
00:51:50,983 --> 00:51:52,275
LOUIS:
Hey, you give me this.

1228
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,068
- Look at that. See that?
- Thank you.

1229
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:57,196
(speaks Ukrainian)

1230
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:00,408
Yes. Yes, he needs to hear it.

1231
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:02,244
Okay.

1232
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,707
I told your parents to do that.

1233
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,626
You did?

1234
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,086
Yes, I did.

1235
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,464
Because the game is rigged,

1236
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:17,091
and we want to take care
of you and your brother.

1237
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,010
That's why.

1238
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:20,136
Listen to what he's telling you.

1239
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:21,721
I am listening.

1240
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,556
Right. I want you
to just really listen

1241
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,558
for the first time in your life.

1242
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,894
Because what he's saying
is important.

1243
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,645
- Just listen to Grandpa.
- GRANDPA: Listen to me.

1244
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,814
When I was young,
I was a very good student,

1245
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,441
but my name was Rabinowitz.

1246
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:37,403
And, um,
in college after college,

1247
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:38,988
during the interviews,
those people,

1248
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,324
whoever the hell they were,
they would look at me,

1249
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,534
they'd smile at me,
look at me up and down, eh,

1250
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,661
like I was some kind of freak
in the circus,

1251
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,122
and then they'd say
with a big smile,

1252
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,999
"Oh, thank you. And sorry,

1253
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,418
"but we don't need any more
Spinowitzes this year.

1254
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:56,547
"Uh, you know, danke schön
and auf Wiedersehen.

1255
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,383
Next." Yeah.

1256
00:52:58,384 --> 00:53:00,386
- ESTHER: That's right.
- Do you get my meaning?

1257
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,179
IRVING:
You know what he's telling you?

1258
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,472
Do you know what that means?

1259
00:53:04,473 --> 00:53:06,015
"We have enough
Spinowitzes here"?

1260
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,559
N-No.

1261
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,269
It means they don't want
any more Jews.

1262
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,813
That's right.
They hated us then,

1263
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:13,898
they didn't want us,
and they still hate us.

1264
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,566
And screw 'em. I don't care.

1265
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,693
But that's why
I'm doing this for you.

1266
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,029
Now, your name is Graff.
That's a better name.

1267
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,531
You can blend in, and why not?

1268
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,199
And, uh,
this new school could, uh,

1269
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,660
introduce you to
a whole new group of friends.

1270
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:27,829
And, uh, you can go to
the college you want to go to.

1271
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,288
Okay?

1272
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,540
I know, but college
doesn't matter

1273
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,041
if you want to be an artist.

1274
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,419
ESTHER:
Uh, you're going to college.

1275
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,004
(chuckles) You're gonna be
an artist if you want to be.

1276
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,589
Nothing's gonna stop you.

1277
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,216
But college is better. I'm...

1278
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,843
I'm trying to help
this smart-ass here

1279
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,470
and you to have
a good education. That's all.

1280
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,888
That's what we're trying to do.

1281
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,390
It's not punishment.

1282
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,683
And I'll tell you
something else.

1283
00:53:48,684 --> 00:53:50,393
Our families...
Your father's family

1284
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:51,936
and our family, your grandma...

1285
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,313
You know, we, uh...
we came to this country

1286
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,524
and, um, we didn't have much.

1287
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,734
We didn't have the good fortune.

1288
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,404
But we saved... your grandmother
and I, we saved...

1289
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:03,406
And now we can help
your parents.

1290
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,575
- And we're going to help you, darling.
- Yeah.

1291
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:06,909
Thank you.

1292
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,661
IRVING: So, then...
so, then it's settled.

1293
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,913
He's going?

1294
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:12,206
- Huh?
- GRANDPA: Yeah.

1295
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,249
- GRANDMA: Yes.
- IRVING: Good.

1296
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,751
Yeah.

1297
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:18,421
GRANDPA:
Hey. Hey, listen.

1298
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,465
In your life, you're gonna have
your ups and your downs.

1299
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,633
You'll have big highs,
and you're gonna have big lows.

1300
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:25,011
- Yabba dabba doo. So what?
- IRVING: Are you kidding me?

1301
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:27,513
He'll have dinner with kings
if he plays his cards right.

1302
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,098
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm with you, Irving.

1303
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,349
This is a new chapter for you.

1304
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,767
New chapter.

1305
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,644

Do you want nova, Irving?

1306
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:36,273
- IRVING: Yes, please.
- GRANDPA: You'll be okay, kid.

1307
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,364
REPORTER (on TV):
...the president has leveled

1308
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,450
one of his sharpest attacks yet
on Ronald Reagan,

1309
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:50,286
telling a Chicago audience
the Republican candidate

1310
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,747
is a divisive force
in American politics.

1311
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:54,791

indistinctly)

1312
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,587
Come on! Get up.
Come on, get up.

1313
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:01,797
Time to get into uniform.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

Why don't you just
leave me alone

1317
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,095
for once in your life, you dick.

1318
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,097
Sit still. Stop it.

1319
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:11,432
Just fit in and act cool.

1320
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,267
Don't talk a lot.

1321
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,936
If you're weak
for even a second,

1322
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:16,896
they'll jump all over you.

1323
00:55:16,897 --> 00:55:18,731
- You got it?
- Mm-hmm.

1324
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,358
- I got it.
- Schmuck. All right, let's go.

1325
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,527
Come on. Get up.
Don't make me late.

No, you don't.

1336
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,345
I can't even have
a normal knapsack.

1337
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,930
A normal knapsack?
Why would you want

1338
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,807
a normal knapsack
when you can have this?

1339
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:55,561

You just want me to be like you.

No. No, big boy.

That's what I want.

You got that?

It's time to grow up.

00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:40,956
Well, since you're new here,
Mr., uh, Greizerstein,

1377
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,459
you should know we have
a tradition here.

1378
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,378
Yes, sir.

1379
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:49,924
And you have the obligation
to live up to that tradition.

1380
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:52,176
We have an assembly
this morning.

1381
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:55,681
I want you to go right straight
through those doors, young man.

1382
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,892
Thank you, sir.

1383
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,608
- Keep going.
- Oh.

1384
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,820
(indistinct chatter)

1385
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,004
Good morning, Forest Manor.

1386
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:32,758
I know I speak for
the entire school community

1387
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:35,428
about how proud we are
to have one of our own

1388
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,931
come visit all of us
for assembly today.

1389
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,850
But before we hear
from our guest,

1390
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:42,977
a special thanks to her father,

1391
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:46,522
who is leading the fundraising
drive for our new library.

1392
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:50,443
The Trump family is our family.

1393
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:53,028
So, Fred, please stand up,
would you?

1394
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,031
(applause)

1395
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,037
- (cheering)
- Fred Trump, everyone.

1396
00:59:02,581 --> 00:59:05,207
Now, we have an election
coming up.

1397
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,209
- STUDENTS: Reagan! Reagan!
- (chuckles)

1398
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:11,380
(more students joining in):
Reagan! Reagan! Reagan! Reagan!

1399
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,550
- Reagan! Reagan!
- No, no, no.

1400
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:18,012
I'm talking about
our student elections.

1401
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:21,182
I would encourage
each and every one of you

1402
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:25,020
who is thinking of running
to listen today, hmm?

1403
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:29,023
And with that, please welcome

1404
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:31,567
United States Attorney
Maryanne Trump.

1405
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,194
Maryanne?

1406
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:35,113

1407
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:44,497
MARYANNE: Thank you so much,
Headmaster Fitzroy.

1408
00:59:44,498 --> 00:59:46,833
And thank you, Father.

1409
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,754
Today, I'm not here
to give you the same old talk.

1410
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:54,966
Today, I'm gonna
give it to you straight.

1411
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:59,303
You're gonna want to go
to a good college.

1412
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:01,932
You're gonna want to succeed.

1413
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,850
But you're not going to.

1414
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,062
Hmm-mm. That's right.

1415
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:11,023
Unless...

1416
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,484
unless you follow the example

1417
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:16,070
that I'm gonna set forth
for you.

1418
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:19,115
You may be saying to yourself,
"What does she know?"

1419
01:00:20,534 --> 01:00:22,117
Well, when I came here,

1420
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:27,206
no one handed me
anything for free.

1421
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:28,582
How did I succeed?

1422
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:32,002
By good old-fashioned hard work.

1423
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,338
And that's how
you're gonna make it.

1424
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:37,634
I knew there was no free lunch.

1425
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,805
Through college, law school,

1426
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:45,975
the U.S. Attorneys Office,

1427
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:49,895
I was a woman
in a man's business.

1428
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:53,732
But I kept on fighting.

1429
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:55,359
That's right, girls.

1430
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,194
I'm talking to you, too.

1431
01:00:57,195 --> 01:01:00,239
Mm-hmm. You can be anything
you want to be in this,

1432
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:03,159
the greatest country
in the world.

1433
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,872
You people in this institution

1434
01:01:07,873 --> 01:01:10,208
are gonna wind up on top.

1435
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:15,629
And you'll know,
at the end of the day,

1436
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:18,215
it won't be
because of a handout.

1437
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:20,342
Right?

1438
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:24,180
It'll be because
you earned your way there.

1439

Um, just drawing
a picture of my hand.

1445

Why you doing that?

1446

1463
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:44,176

for the school.

1464
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:47,055

01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,025
and then they'll all think
I'm not cool.

1551
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:13,362
And then I'll get angry
at myself.

1552
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:16,365
Can you tell me more
about why you're angry?

1553
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:19,284
Running away is pretty serious.

1554
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:22,412
I don't...
I don't really mean angry.

1555
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:25,416
("Justice Tonight/Kick It Over"
by The Clash playing)

1556
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,717
(indistinct chatter)

1557
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:49,648
(song fades)

1558
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:51,150
ESTHER:
Paul?

1559
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,738
Oh, my God, I fell asleep.

1560
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,241
Where were you?
What time is it?

1561
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:01,243
Is it late?

1562
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,912
I took an express train
by accident.

1563
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:06,416
- (Esther sighs)
- I'm sorry.

1564
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,838
(sighs)

1565
01:08:12,839 --> 01:08:18,094
P-Paul, you need to see, uh,
see your grandfather this week.

1566
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:22,098
Okay.

1567
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:25,017
Is everything all right?

1568
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:27,144
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Everything's fine.

1569
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:30,314
Everything's fine.
He just, um...

1570
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:32,441
He wants to spend some time
with you. That's all.

1571
01:08:32,442 --> 01:08:35,152
He said that the two of you
would launch your rocket.

1572
01:08:35,153 --> 01:08:37,697
- Oh, yeah, I got to finish it.
- Mm.

1573
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:44,287
Ma?

1574
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:50,126
Uh, I had a pretty good day
at school.

1575
01:08:51,544 --> 01:08:53,212
Good.

1576
01:09:02,472 --> 01:09:06,142
All my hopes are with you
and your brother now.

1577
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:10,438
You're my angels,
and you're everything to me.

1578
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:15,693
You're my whole life.

1579
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:21,282
But we're all still here.

1580
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:33,919
I'm not feeling so hot, buster.
I'm gonna go upstairs.

1581
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,837
(sighs)

1582
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:37,589
Be careful.
Your father saw a Black boy

1583
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,424
sneaking around the alleyway,

1584
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:41,843
so make sure you lock
everything up.

1585
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,513
- Okay.
- Okay.

1586
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,651
(whispers):
Johnny?

1587
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,491
Johnny, you there?

1588
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:24,929
Grandpa.

1589
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,058
GRANDPA:
It's a little windy today,

1590
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,768
so, uh, that might affect it.

1591
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:34,187
If we're lucky,
it'll go straight up

1592
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:36,399
and come straight down near us.

1593
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:40,110
I put these markings
on the side of the rocket.

1594
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:41,611
Yeah, I saw that.

1595
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:43,738
"USA," and you got
the old payload markings.

1596
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,407
- Yeah.
- Nice.

1597
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:47,993
You got a lot more patience
than I have, jelly bean.

1598
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:50,245
- Great job.
- Thanks, Grandpa.

1599
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,289
Okay. What happens next?
You want that?

1600
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:54,333
Yeah, I'm gonna need that.

1601
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:56,918
Listen, I just wanted
to talk to you

1602
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,420
about something, and, uh...

1603
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,630
There's something
I wanted to tell you.

1604
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:02,966
I'm gonna have to go away
for a few days.

1605
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:06,094
Uh, on a trip. Um...

1606
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,637
- Uh, hope...
- A trip?

1607
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:09,347
Yes, so hopefully not too long.

1608
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,600
It'll be, uh...
I'll be back soon.

1609
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,560
It's not too far...
Just out on the island.

1610
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:15,604
I have to go check out
some things.

1611
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:18,023
And I wanted to tell you myself
so that you're not wondering

1612
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:21,151
where I am if, uh,
you don't see me around, okay?

1613
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:23,028
Okay, but you better
be back soon.

1614
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:24,529
I will, okay?

1615
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:26,448
- Now what? You gonna launch?
- Yeah.

1616
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:28,033
- Is there the...
- Is this what you want?

1617
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:29,784
Yes, I need that.

1618
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,369
- Good.
- Oh.

1619
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,121
You'll end up a rocket scientist

1620
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:35,750
- instead of an artist.
- Mm.

1621
01:11:36,918 --> 01:11:39,629
(robotically):
I shall check the connectors.

1622
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,467
So, how you doing?

1623
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:47,470
How are things
at the new school?

1624
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,640
Mm...

1625
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:54,393
Something's bugging you.
What is it?

1626
01:11:56,896 --> 01:11:59,564
Sometimes kids say stuff.

1627
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:02,192
Kids say stuff. Yeah, they do.

1628
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:04,152
But, like, what kind of stuff?

1629
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,363
I don't know, they'll...

1630
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:09,699
say stuff, like,
about other kids.

1631
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,827
Come on. Come here.
I can't hear you.

1632
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:16,665
Well, they'll just say stuff
about other kids.

1633
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,416
Like what?

1634
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:22,212
Well, they'll say bad words
about the Black kids.

1635
01:12:22,213 --> 01:12:24,465
Oh, yeah?

1636
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:28,343
Yeah, okay.

1637
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:31,137
And, uh...

1638
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:33,015
what do you do
when that happens?

1639
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:36,518
Come on, tell me.

1640
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:38,395
Obviously nothing, of course.

1641
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:40,188
"Nothing, of course." Yeah.

1642
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,524
You think that's funny?
You think that's smart?

1643
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:43,900
Well, I'll tell you
what I think.

1644
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:46,528
I think that's a crock
of old horseshit.

1645
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:47,862
I said a bad word.

1646
01:12:47,863 --> 01:12:49,698
You got a problem with that?
Tough.

1647
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:51,700
I'm gonna tell you.
Now, you got to do something.

1648
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:54,286
You got to say something, okay?

1649
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:56,288
Do you know why?
'Cause you're on the ball.

1650
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:57,706
Right? Come on, man.

1651
01:12:57,707 --> 01:12:59,332
You were raised better
than that.

1652
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:01,209
Jesus Christ.

1653
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,669
I'm going to tell you something.

1654
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,630
I've learned over the years,
those bastards

1655
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:08,383
who say all that crap
and garbage to your face

1656
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,719
will then say the same stuff
behind your back.

1657
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,596
And they'll shove a knife
straight in your gut.

1658
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:14,222
And they'll smile as they do it.

1659
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,682
Fuck 'em.

1660
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:18,393
Yeah, I said another bad word.

1661
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:20,312
You remember one thing.

1662
01:13:20,313 --> 01:13:22,105
Next time those schmucks say
anything bad

1663
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:24,733
about those Black kids
or those Hispanics,

1664
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:27,611
you be a mensch
to those kids, okay?

1665
01:13:27,612 --> 01:13:29,739
They never had your advantage.

1666
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:32,616
Give me a handshake.

1667
01:13:32,617 --> 01:13:34,534
You're gonna be a mensch, okay?

1668
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:36,871
Firm handshake.
Okay, give me a hug.

1669
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:41,499
- PAUL: Love you.
- GRANDPA: Love you, too.

1670
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,919
Okay, let's get on
with the launch.

1671
01:13:45,588 --> 01:13:47,339
Oh, I'm so nervous.

1672
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,590
Don't be nervous. Be bold.

1673
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:50,258
- Yes, bold. Okay.
- Go on.

1674
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,676
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1675
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:52,677
Here we go.
(imitates radio static)

1676
01:13:52,678 --> 01:13:54,262
Roger. Ready for liftoff.

1677
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,597
(imitates radio static)
Over. Copy.

1678
01:13:55,598 --> 01:13:57,015
(imitates radio static)

1679
01:13:57,016 --> 01:13:59,559
Ten, nine, eight,

seven, six, five, four,

three, two, one.

1682
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,029
Oh!

1683
01:14:11,030 --> 01:14:12,572
(laughs)

1684
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:15,158
- Hey, that's something. Yeah.
- Whoa!

1685
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,786
Whoa!

1686
01:14:19,789 --> 01:14:21,791

01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:55,490
Paul. Paul.

- (gasping breaths)
- Hey.

1692
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:58,910
Get dressed.

1693
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:00,578
You need to get up right now.

1694
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:02,622
- What?
- Get dressed.

1695
01:15:02,623 --> 01:15:05,375

PAUL:
What's going on?

1697
01:15:08,462 --> 01:15:11,172
Grandpa had surgery
this morning.

1698
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,841
For what?

1699
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,676
They said bone cancer.

1700
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,553
Mom knew like a month ago,
but Dad said

1701
01:15:16,554 --> 01:15:19,681
they were worried
about how you'd take it.

1702
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:22,183
What do you mean?
I can take anything.

1703
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,144
I'm just...

1704
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:27,273
kind of worried about Mom,
how she'll react.

1705
01:15:29,817 --> 01:15:32,026
She'll freak out if he dies.

1706
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:34,155

raspy breaths)

take your brother out.

1710
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:43,849
- Come on.
- No, I want to stay.

1711
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,186
(whispers):
He shouldn't see him like this.

1712
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:54,026
I'm gonna stay.

1713
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:20,760

We don't need to stay too long.

1716
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:34,649
All right, just let
your mother alone.

1717
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,653
We can just stay here
in the car.

1718
01:17:42,616 --> 01:17:44,826
Why are we staying in the car?

1719
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:46,369
Doesn't Mom want us out there?

1720
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,329
No, it's all right.
Let-let her, you know...

1721

Let her have her feelings,
and then...

1722
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,918
and then we can swing around
and go home.

1723
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,047
You know, you have schoolwork.

1724
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,886
Your grandfather, he, uh...

1725
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,308
...he was very kind to me.

1726
01:18:11,729 --> 01:18:14,939
He respected me.
He's the only one.

1727
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,692
The rest of your mother's
family, they heard my father

1728
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,611
- was a plumber, and...
- (snaps fingers)

1729
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,780
...bang, they just
turned their nose up.

1730
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:24,867
Not him.

1731
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:29,246
He was...
he was a terrific guy.

1732
01:18:30,372 --> 01:18:32,333
He held us all together.

1733
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,885
I guess it's all on me now.

1734
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:48,140
Goodbye, Aaron.

1735
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:53,145
Goodbye, Grandpa.

1736
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:13,915
IRVING:
Lock the doors.

1737
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:15,625
(Esther muttering)

1738
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:17,920
- Mom?
- Oh.

1739
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,428
(humming)

1740
01:19:32,810 --> 01:19:37,231
"Louisiana Lightning"
Rod Guidry.

1741
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:41,151
JOHNNY:
Hey. How you doing?

1742
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:45,947
Hey.

1743
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:48,449
You were here before.

1744
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:51,077
- Right?
- Yeah, I was.

1745
01:19:51,078 --> 01:19:54,163
Those dudes come by
my grandma's place again, so...

1746
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:56,834
I'm here for a little bit,
till it's cool to go back.

1747
01:19:57,918 --> 01:19:59,794
I think they're gonna put her
in a home soon.

1748
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:01,422
Wow.

1749
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,970
I'm sorry I...

1750
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:11,390
I couldn't really talk
at school.

1751
01:20:13,392 --> 01:20:14,852
They're really strict.

1752
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,063
Oh, I could see that for sure.

1753
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:24,152
Whoa.

1754
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:26,821
Hey, your toes, they're all
cut up and bleeding.

1755
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:28,364
You should get some Band-Aids.

1756
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:30,324
Come inside.

1757
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:32,493
Actually, it's getting
a lot better.

1758
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:36,456
But looks like you're all
set up with your stylin' suit.

1759
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:38,166
Looking good.

1760
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:41,836
It's for my grandpa's funeral.

1761
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:44,338
Oh, damn.

1762
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:45,966
That's heavy.

1763
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:50,011
You know, I've been thinking
about it for a while.

1764
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:52,221
My stepbro,
he's in Florida, right?

1765
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:54,891
Soon as I get the cash,
I go down there,

1766
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:56,476
make some money and do shit

1767
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:58,644
until I can sign up
with the Air Force or NASA.

1768
01:20:58,645 --> 01:21:01,647
But they're building this thing
in Orlando called EPCOT.

1769
01:21:01,648 --> 01:21:03,691
Here, look-it.

1770
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,693
You could draw there.

1771
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:07,863
Like you do in class.

1772
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,366
Make money that way.

1773
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:16,204
Seems kind of far.

1774
01:21:16,205 --> 01:21:19,041
Shit, man, what are you staying
around here for?

1775
01:21:22,336 --> 01:21:23,879
I know.

1776
01:21:25,214 --> 01:21:27,757
Here, I'm gonna get you
a blanket.

1777
01:21:27,758 --> 01:21:29,383
Okay.

1778
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,219
But I ain't gonna
stick around long, probably.

1779
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,471
But I'm thinking Florida soon.

1780
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:35,890
Okay. I'll be right back.

1781
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,643
All right.

1782
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:47,486
♪ ♪

1783
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,911
JOHNNY:
Grandma.

1784
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:59,122
We can't stay together.

1785
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:01,250
They're gonna take you away.

1786
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:06,547
I'm gonna make you proud.

1787
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:16,139
IRVING: And we already had to
schmear the school but good,

1788
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:17,932
just to get him in.

1789
01:22:17,933 --> 01:22:19,892
The-the report,
it says he's-he's...

1790
01:22:19,893 --> 01:22:21,936
he's not paying attention
in class.

1791
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,688
This was supposed to be
the answer.

1792
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:26,065
I mean, what the hell
are we supposed to do now?

1793
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:28,442
Irving, I don't want
to talk about this now.

1794
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:31,445
He doesn't have the same
potential that Ted does.

1795
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:33,114
He doesn't have it.

1796
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:35,366
- They assessed him as slow.
- ESTHER: Fuck them.

1797
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,993
- IRVING: There's something wrong with him.
- Fuck them.

1798
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:38,411
ESTHER:
Are you serious?

1799
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:40,079
IRVING:
He talks about being an artist.

1800
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,914
An artist.
His head is in the clouds.

1801
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:44,000
He's not living in reality.

1802
01:22:44,001 --> 01:22:45,877
And this has to stop.

1803
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:48,171
It has to stop, Esther.

1804
01:22:48,172 --> 01:22:49,797
- And the school...
- ESTHER: Irving.

1805
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:51,757
...the school will cost
your mother an arm and a leg.

1806
01:22:51,758 --> 01:22:53,968
- Please, please...
- Who knows when she'll need more help

1807
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,553
now that she's alone,
she's on her own.

1808
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:58,264
We're-we're completely
dependent on her.

1809
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:00,391
Who's... who will
figure it out?

1810
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:02,310
The tuition's... I can't pay.

1811
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:08,025
I-I-I feel the-the goddamn
pressure in my chest.

1812
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:12,278
ESTHER:
What do you want me to do?

1813
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:14,572
With my father gone,
there isn't anyone

1814
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:16,699
that can reach him.

1815
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,826
(voice shaking):
Not you.

1816
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:21,163
N-Not anyone.

1817
01:23:25,792 --> 01:23:27,793
MS. MOUSTAKAS (faint, echoing):
And each time we try

1818
01:23:27,794 --> 01:23:29,670
to draw ourselves,
we are drawing

1819
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:34,383
not only what we think we see
but who we are inside.

1820
01:23:34,384 --> 01:23:36,636
Our essence.

1821
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:38,930
(normal): If you need
any inspiration on essence,

1822
01:23:38,931 --> 01:23:40,598
you can see the essence
of Paul Gauguin

1823
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:42,850
in this self-portrait.

1824
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:46,979
Look at the colors Paul Gauguin
uses to express himself, right?

1825
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:49,690
Blues, oranges, pinks.

1826
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:51,442
Paul?

1827
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:53,278
Earth to Paul.

1828
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:56,364
(chuckles)

1829
01:23:56,365 --> 01:23:59,158
It's a spaceship drawn by
our very own space cadet.

1830
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:00,868
- (laughter)
- (sighs): Okay.

1831
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:05,039
Hey, this isn't the assignment,
but it is beautiful.

1832
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,832
So expressive.

1833
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,834
The colors he's using here.

1834
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:10,629
You're very talented.

1835
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:14,716
(whispers):
Now let's do the assignment.

1836
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:17,301
What are you gonna do with it?

1837
01:24:17,302 --> 01:24:18,803
That's none of your beeswax,
Miss Bronfman.

1838
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:20,388
Uh, and like I was mentioning...

1839
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:22,265
- (school bell ringing)
- Um, that... Pencils.

1840
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:24,267
(Esther crying)

1841
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:26,143
IRVING:
Stop, Esther.

1842
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:27,729
That's enough!

1843
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:32,733
GRANDPA:
You want to be famous,

1844
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,402
you can do what you like,
but if you're gonna be famous,

1845
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:36,195
you got to sign
the drawings first.

1846
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:38,407
All the great artists
sign their work.

1847
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:42,285
(gasps) -You're gonna be
an artist if you want to be.

1848
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:44,121
Nothing's gonna stop you.

1849
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:48,083
- (siren wailing in distance)
- (heavy breathing)

1850
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:57,008
(Johnny grunts softly)

1851
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:59,468
- PAUL (whispers): Johnny.
- JOHNNY: What?

1852
01:24:59,469 --> 01:25:02,680
PAUL: I think I know how
to make everything okay.

1853
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:04,974
My school has
a bunch of computers.

1854
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:06,767
Let's take one.

1855
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:08,394
Take what?

1856
01:25:08,395 --> 01:25:10,938
Computer.
We can get it so easy.

1857
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,940
I know how to get in
and everything.

1858
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,942
We go through the window.

1859
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:16,777
They keep them open
all the time.

1860
01:25:16,778 --> 01:25:18,696
You must be out of your mind.

1861
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:20,156
No, we can do it.

1862
01:25:20,157 --> 01:25:22,325
We'll run away to Florida.

1863
01:25:22,326 --> 01:25:24,785
Let's do it. Let's go.

1864
01:25:24,786 --> 01:25:26,788
A computer?

1865
01:25:27,831 --> 01:25:29,957
Yeah, we sell it.
It pays for the whole trip.

1866
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:32,127
You'll go to NASA,
and I can draw.

1867
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:34,755
You're coming with me.

1868
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:37,131
(scoffs)

1869
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:39,175
You can even see
your stepbrother soon.

1870
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:41,093
The school is just
three subway stops away.

1871
01:25:41,094 --> 01:25:42,803
Come on.

1872
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:44,639
Nobody will ever know.

1873
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,771
(shuddering breaths)

1874
01:25:53,273 --> 01:25:55,650
(Paul muttering quietly)

1875
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:01,947
I told you, we can't get in.

1876
01:26:01,948 --> 01:26:03,492
PAUL:
Wait.

1877
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:10,039
There's no point.

1878
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,749
PAUL:
Ah, shit.

1879
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,502
JOHNNY (whispers):
There's no point.

1880
01:26:15,545 --> 01:26:17,839
I told you. I told you.
I told you.

1881
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,738
(taking slow, deep breaths)

1882
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:55,710
(breath trembling)

1883
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,966
(door creaking)

1884
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:19,942
CROWD (echoing):
Paul! Paul! Paul! Paul!

1885
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:23,279
Paul! Paul! Paul! Paul! Paul!

1886
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:26,240
Paul! Paul! Paul! Paul!

1887
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:29,286
- (chant fades)
- (rocket engine whooshes)

1888
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:33,665
JOHNNY (whispers):
Dude. What are you doing?

1889
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:37,251
- I'm...
- What are you doing out here?

1890
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:39,004
This is dangerous.

1891
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:42,798
- Okay.
- Are you sure this is all that we need?
