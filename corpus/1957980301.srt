00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,787

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,122
Hey Paul

192
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,208

Anyway you ready to lose that pool champ
title today

195
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,739
You know it's not healthy
to lie to yourself right

196
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:45,222
- Oh now he got the jokes?
Alright man

197
00:13:45,478 --> 00:13:48,692
You already know I'm gonna spank you like
an albino midget Eskimo hooker homie.

199
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,772
What does that even mean?

200
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,649
Sounds like a good time to me

201
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,585
You boys need Jesus

202
00:13:55,773 --> 00:13:59,641
You're probably right maybe
he's uh shooting pool let's go see

203
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,929
Maybe

204
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,067
You need to call
CPS when he does that shit

205
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:16,483
No it's not as bad as it
seems. I can handle my dad

206
00:14:16,508 --> 00:14:19,717
Whatever you say, but if he
lays one f... king finger on you

207
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,278
he's got all of us to deal with
Okay, got it

208
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:24,399
You're family now - Thanks

209
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,810
He hasn't been able to come back because
he's been working extra long shifts

210
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:33,581
Hey, as long as he's bringing home
that bank it's not a problem

211
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:35,495
You're not wrong on that one

212
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,419
But he does need to hurry up and get
back so we can go to the camp because

213
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,781
Man that river water is going to feel nice

214
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,590
Madeline isn't it?

215
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,927
Yes! I mean yes sir

216
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:06,014
How's our little town treating you?

217
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,951
I know it must be a bit of a culture
shock from way up north

218
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,579
Uh it's been nice, everyone's been great

219
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,294
Good, well I knew a pretty
girl like you would fit right in

I want to apologize for what my wife put
you through

227
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,471
No child should have to witness that

228
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,460
No no sir I'm I'm sorry I didn't

229
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,995
Don't you dare be sorry
she doesn't deserve any pity

230
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,120
that's selfish b... tch! She...

But we got hookers and hardcore drugs

247
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,586
Oh! Why didn't you just say so

248
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,256
Anyway

249
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,591

Son of that doctor that bought the old
Dedeaux place about a week or so ago

254

flirt with this guy

355
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,495
it's like she has a douchebag magnet in

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,484
her vagina or something

357
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:21,798
I don't know about the douchebag magnet...

932
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,054
always

933
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:44,426
This one was different.
I could see her

934
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:47,160
more clearly than others

935
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,495
like I could see details of the

936
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,334
silhouette

937
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:53,493
she moved

938
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,094
and spoke before grabbing me

939
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,255
It felt like she was gonna
kill me and make

940
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,880
me lose my mind

941
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:06,790
in a way she did

942
01:02:07,839 --> 01:02:10,460
in a way I did

943
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,420
lose my mind

944
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,631
you know

945
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,425
What'd she look like

946
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,971
Well it looked like she
was wearing a cloak

947
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:22,973
or something

948
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,892
a filthy old gown

949
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,727
it looked and

950
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,760
smelled like something from the swamp

951
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,401
She said something to me

952
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,111
Jije

953
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:41,283
Yes! That's it. What does
that mean? What is it?!

954
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,702
It's you

955
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:45,162
It's what you are

956
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,746
I'm sorry?

957
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,416
Many things have been lost over time

958
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,416
many things

959
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,255
stories, knowledge, magic lost

960
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,966
I hate this path for you boy

961
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:02,301
It ain't right that the powers that be make
this a burden for you.

962
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:07,574
I don't know who she is but
you're not the first to see her

963
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,486
My Jonas think that

964
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:13,255
she was the spirit of an old slave woman

965
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,695
a pwotege

966
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:17,655
that lost her jije

967
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,655
Seems she got no interest in going where

968
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,319
she belong

969
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:24,135
She's so

970
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,373
filled with anger and she's

971
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,975
she's gone mad with grief

972
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,093
my Jonas talked about

973
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,087
he just said she's just a presence

974
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,334
never said nothing about her hurt nobody

975
01:03:39,405 --> 01:03:41,512
she's just so sad and

976
01:03:41,625 --> 01:03:43,735
she don't want to leave

977
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,975
I don't understand

978
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,735
You're a jije

979
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,135
a judge

980
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,455
You know how you can tell someone's good

981
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,814
or bad right after you've met them

982
01:03:55,839 --> 01:03:57,014
or

983
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:59,094
Like how you know right when something's

984
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:01,252
bad about to happen

985
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,865
or like how you always feel so drawn to

986
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,618
serve justice to them bullies

987
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:09,371
That's you

988
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,332
That's what you were born as

989
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:14,376
I'm sorry

990
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,002
I don't follow

991
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,129
So the purpose of a jije

992
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,049
is to separate the bad energy from the

993
01:04:21,074 --> 01:04:24,094
good energies when people die

994
01:04:24,852 --> 01:04:27,180
Now this can take a toll

995
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,415
on a human's body

996
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,145
Especially when you got them spirits
that don't want to go to the bad place

997
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,817
Many of jije have gone
mad trying to do this

998
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:40,519
Them are usually the ones that ain't got

999
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,975
they pwotege

1000
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,255
and so they got no help to fight back

1001
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,486
what's a pwot..

1002
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:50,160
Pwotege

1003
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,175
It's a jije soul mate

1004
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:56,133
It keeps them grounded

1005
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,533
and it helps heal them as that bad

1006
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,935
energy pass through

1007
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,094
A pwotege can also see a person's inner

1008
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:04,215
light

1009
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,255
and they can commune with the dead

1010
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,735
Without they pwotege

1011
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,334
a jije

1012
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:13,094
just goes mad

1013
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,920

1014
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,760

You... you okay Mr Goodrich?

1017
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,655
You came about your brother

1018
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,135
She's getting in his head

1019
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:41,013
I came for answers

1020
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:42,855

1021
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,839
Well try telling me again!

1022
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:54,000

1024
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:57,479
Though

1025
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,856
I don't think she can really hear it

1026
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,483
