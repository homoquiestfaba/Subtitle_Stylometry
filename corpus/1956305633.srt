- [Sighs] Colonel Sykes.
- Yeah.

7
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,806
- Your counsel is here to see you, sir.
- Yeah.

[Buzzer Buzzes]

00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,350
- Morning, Colonel.
- Hey, Bill. What do you got for me ?

10
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:12,187
Good news. I passed your plea bargain
before the chief judge adjutant.

11
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,249
He's agreed to allow
your men to walk away...

12
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,489
with a general discharge
and no incarceration.

13
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,157
And they'll be receiving
full mustering-out pay?

14
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,428
Every dime they've got coming.

15
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:25,904
Also, the judge adjutant has agreed
to sentence you to no more...

16
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:29,237
than ten years
in a medium-security prison.

17
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,939
As opposed to the 25 years
to life in a military prison...

18
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:35,879
that the prosecutor
is going for.

19
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,442
All this, of course, being
contingent on my guilty plea?

20
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,352
All I need is your consent.

21
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:44,857
If it weren't for these
damn bleeding hearts,

22
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:47,325
I'd be getting a medal
instead of a court-martial.

23
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:51,621

That's not for me to say, sir.

If it weren't
for my men's future,

27
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,712
I'd be fighting these bastards
tooth and nail on this.

28
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:17,622
Yeah, tell them I'm in.

29
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:23,361
You've made the right decision, sir.

indeed
to the Marine Corps itself…

34
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,769
that this war criminal...

35
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:41,871
be allowed
to plea-bargain his way:

36
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,713
out of the consequences
that lay before him.

37
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,980
Colonel John Sykes...

38
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:51,513
and those three men
under his direct command

39
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,855
laid waste
to an entire village.

40
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:56,759
Four marine pilots,

41
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:01,494

by drug runners in that village.

42
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,934
- Order!
- And those innocent villagers...

43
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:06,097
stood by and let it happen.

44
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:11,076
- Colonel Sykes be seated !
- No, they were our men, goddamn it!

45
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,876
Our sons and brothers,

You call it vengeance.

- I call it justice.
- I said order!

48
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:27,283
- Continue, prosecutor.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,957
It is recommended that the men

stand trial as individuals
for their part...

54
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:47,909
in this heinous outrage.

55
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,914

- Colonel Sykes!

will be removed... to the stockade.

for your recommendations.

After due consideration...

60
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:15,431
It is the order
of this court-martial...

61
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:19,069
that Colonel Sykes's plea
of guilty will stand.

and rescinded.

you are a disgrace to the uniform.

turn off your phone before takeoff.

We don't have a first-class section.
We have coach or business.

- Oh, then I'll take business.
- We'll see what we can do.

You're not listening.
There's been a mistake.

I understand, and as I said, we’ll take
care of this as soon as we take off.

99

Please find your seat.
We'll be leaving in a few minutes.

How nice of you to join us.
You just missed Mr. Wonderful.

- [Groans] Whose section is he in?
- He's in yours.

105
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,298
Oh, great.
Wanna switch ?

106
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,635
- Not a chance.
- Come on, Gwen.

107
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,733
Didn't I switch with you when you had
that obnoxious jerk coming from L.A. ?

Oh, yeah. That guy
was a real prince, wasn't he ?

- I'm in business class this trip.
- Great. That's my section.

114
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,222
As soon as we're airborne,
I'll see if you need anything.

115

- Great. Ladies.
- Mm-hmm.

116
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,571

switching sections.

- So I'll still owe you one.
- Terrific.

Yo, sugar-tush. Vodka tonic, chop-chop.

00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:07,588
We'll start serving drinks
as soon as we're airborne, sir.

125
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,069
Make a note, Sammy. Don't ever
take this airline. The service bites.

126
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:14,437
Anyway, you're gonna love the view from
the other side of this deal. Trust me.

General, there have been
a couple of changes.

The FBI's deputy director
will not be attending after all.

129
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,904
- What's his excuse ?
- He's flying into Dallas tonight.

130
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:23,949
Some sort of fund-raiser
for the governor.

131
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,984
You mean to tell me
that pressing the flesh...

132
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,113
with a bunch of oil barons
is more important to him...

133
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,919
-than a counter-terrorism summit ?
- It would appear so, sir.

134
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:35,484
- Thank you.
- God save us from bureaucrats.

What are you doing ? Spending New Year's
with Prince Charming in business class ?

141
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:11,087
- Could be.
- That the way you met your last husband?

142
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:15,293
Yeah. Well, you know me. I'm always in
the market for ex-husband number four.

143
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,166
Good morning, gentlemen.
Welcome aboard

You're sitting in 4-J and 4-K,
which is forward.

- This way, sir.
- I heard her. Thank you, miss.

146
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,539
- Okay. Time to shut the hatch.
- Okay.

147
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:34,342
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Room for one more?

Hey, guys.

153
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:25,768
Kelly wasn't sure you
we’re gonna make the flight.

154
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:29,001
It's been awhile
since I had a layover in D.C.

155
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:33,068
- I'd forgotten how bad traffic is.
- Second only to Atlanta.

156
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,046
Mmm-- You guys doing okay?
You need coffee or anything ?

157
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,914
- I'm good.
- I'll just rough it, thanks.

All right. Suit your selves.
Holler if you change your minds.

- Okay.
- Okay.

160

Is it just me,
or is she really hot ?

161
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:50,454
Easy. I can hear the sexual harassment
attorneys howling at the gate.

00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,544
Acknowledged. Thanks for your
hospitality. Catch you on the return.

168
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,882
- Okay, let's get ready to take her up.
- You've got it.

169
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:18,083
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome aboard Flight 777...

170
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,421
nonstop service to Los Angeles.

171
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:23,951
As we taxi toward the runway, there are
a few safety procedures to go over.

172
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,970
Sir, can I ask you to return
your seat to its upright position ?

173
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,972
- Sure.
- Thank you.

174
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,304
- Just get it done.
- Would you mind stowing that bag ?

175
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,401
- Dump it, Sammy
-Thanks very much.

176
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,709
No, no. Damn it, Sammy
Eleven and a fifth.

177
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,250
Eleven. One-one.
Side-by-side.

178
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:49,618
- Are you trying to bankrupt me ?
- Sir, that phone needs to go off.

179
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:52,988
Honey, this phone goes off when you
pry it out of my cold, dead fingers.

180
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,527
And this plane doesn't leave the ground
until you put it away.

181
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:59,258
Why don't you be a good girl
and go fetch that vodka tonic, huh ?

182
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:03,632
Thanks a bunch. Sammy, are you there ?
This is-- Hey-- Give me that phone.

183
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:06,171
You'll get the phone back
when the captain gives the "all clear."

184
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,434
Listen to me.
I need that phone.

185
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,839
Sir, do you want to be
put off this plane ?

186
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,538
[Scoffs]
No.

187
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:17,344
Then fasten your seat belt, sit up
straight, and get ready for takeoff.

188
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,555
Flight attendants, take your seats,
prepare for departure.

189
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,496
Excuse me. Sir, would you mind
if I sat next to you during takeoff?

190
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,590
Not at all. Please.

191
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:42,005
- Ah. Thanks. Gwen.
- I'm John.

192
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,035
- So how long is the flight ?
- About five and a half hours.

193
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,581
But we've got good weather,
and our pilot has a reputation...

194
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:51,776
for landing ahead of schedule.

195
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,784
Not too far, I hope.

196
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,082
Wouldn't know what to do
with all the extra time.

197
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,318
- [Chuckles]
-[Warning Bell Chimes]

198
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,723
Oh.
Seat belt time.

199
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,448
Hey, sweetie, how about
that drink, huh ?

200
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:56,147
- There you go.
- Thank you.

201
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:58,547
You're welcome.
Hey, sweetheart.

202
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,608
Say "Thank you"

203
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,639
When we land, General, we’ll be going
straight to the federal building...

204
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:57,505
- rather than the hotel.
- After a cross-country flight ?

205
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:01,274
- I'll need a little time to prepare.
- We have no choice.

206
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:05,613
Doesn't anyone think that terrorism
is something to worry about ?

207
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,914
I've prepared
this brief, General.

208
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:11,183
It should bring you up to speed
on everything you'll need to know

209
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,281
Hmmm--

210
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,163
- Champagne ?
- Please.

211
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,841
- There you go.
- Thanks.

212
00:19:08,747 --> 00:19:11,079
That's interesting.
What is it ?

213
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:16,020
- Oh, it's a dog.
- Oh.

214
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:19,888
It's supposed to be, anyway.
My daughter made it for me in school.

215
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,086
It's cute.
How old is she ?

216
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,620
- She's eight.
- You two must be very close.

217
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,893
Oh,yeah. Very.

218
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,401
Especially since her mother
passed away two years ago.

219
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:33,370
- It's just the two of us now.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

220
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:37,636
- So am I.
- Where is your daughter now ?

221
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,804
Spending a couple of days
with her grandparents.

222
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:45,146
- Bet you miss her.
- Oh, yeah.

223
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:47,549
But you know,
carrying this helps.

224
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:51,317
[Chuckles]
I'll be back.

225
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,314
Here you are, sir.

226
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:29,321
- What is this ?
- Sir, you ordered a gin and tonic.

227
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,955
I said vodka tonic.
Take it away.

228
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,067
[Sighs]

229
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,851
They've run out
of paper towels.

230
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,911
Thanks.
I'll keep that in mind.

231
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:11,389
- [Chuckles]
- An investment banker. Well,

232
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,397
you must spoil
your daughter rotten.

233
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,628
- Of course. What’s a daddy for, right ?
- Yeah.

234
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,891
- What's the matter?
- That guy climbing the stairs.

235
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,950
- What ?
- You'd better come with me.

236
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,326
Wh-What's wrong ?
What did you see ?

237
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:07,512
- Hello in the cockpit. Excuse me.
- Yes, may we help you ?

238
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:12,114
- Yeah, we got a situation out here.
- What kind of situation ?

239
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,093
- Get them to open it.
- Wait, I can't. I--

240
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,153
- Do as he says.
- [Gasps]

241
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,824
Uh, Captain,
It-It's Gwen, sir.

242
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,599
I really need one of you
down in coach right away

243
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:29,606
- What's the problem, Gwen ?
- Don't open the door!

244
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:32,405
- Don't!
- Davis.

245
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,574
- Uhh !
- Hands in the air, gentlemen.

246
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:07,578
Miss, give my associate
the key to the luggage bay.

247
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:11,207
- The what ?
- I won't ask twice.

248
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,809
Okay. Okay.

249
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:15,876
Colonel.

250
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:21,092
Any tricks and
I'll snap your neck.

251
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,329
Be careful with that gun. A stray
round could puncture the airframe.

252
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:29,766
It's loaded with hollow points.
Good for the plane, bad for you.

253
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:33,100
Just fly the plane.
Take us down to 10,000 feet.

254
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:35,265
Then you won't
have to worry about it.

255
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,173
I'm gonna send that stupid jerk
my cleaning bill.

256
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:19,113
- Stay put and be quiet.
- Ah-- Ah-- Ow.

257
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,455
Com check. Com check.
Everyone receiving ?

258
00:25:58,523 --> 00:26:02,187
- Gotcha. Check good.
- Good. Let's go.

259
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:06,186
Stay.

260
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,431
Hey!

261
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:14,837

00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,170
Shut up! Quiet!

Everybody take a breath.

272
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:52,072
Everybody just breathe.

00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,908

Now, anyone who resists
will be shot.

Your destination is

to the back of the cabin, please.

Are you all right ?

00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:21,436
Please, don't be afraid.
Everything will be fine.

Are you all right ? Everything's
gonna be all right. Come on.

284
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,080

Please speak up.
I can barely hear you.

Look, I can't shout, okay?

313
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,895
I need you to connect me
with Dulles air traffic control.

- Hello ? Hello ?
- [Chirping]

Dead battery.
Damn it!

of the plane, sir.

Well, you're looking
very well, General.

320
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:31,059
How does it feel knowing
you earned your new position...

321
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,996
- partially because of me ?
- [Chuckles]

322
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,329
You arrogant bastard.

323
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:40,599
- It had nothing to do with you.
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.

324
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,505
Oh, I’ve done
my homework, General.

325
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:47,068
I know all about that backroom deal
that guaranteed you...

326
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:50,240
the cochairman position
in exchange for my head.

about that?

you'll find I know a great many things
I'm not supposed to.

330
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,989
So you know. Big deal.

331
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:10,126
I'd have done it anyway.
You were a mad dog...

332
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,670
-that had to be put down.
- A dog ?

333
00:31:12,737 --> 00:31:16,469
I  was a marine
doing my duty.

334
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:20,671
Now, I had honor...
until you took it away from me.

335
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:24,978
But today--
today-- I get it back.

336
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,986
You've hijacked a planeload of innocent
people to get your honor back?

337
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,045
I understand how
you could be confused.

338
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:34,490
But it will make sense
in the end.

339
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,518
You're over the wire, Sykes.
You massacred that village.

340
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:41,725
You killed three men
when you blew that van up.

341
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:44,359
You're not a marine.
You're a traitor.

342
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,935
Before this is over...

343
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:54,104
we'll see who's the marine
and who's the traitor.

344
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:57,011
Let's go, guys. Let's get
this flight attendant out of here.

345
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,015
- Where do we stash him ?
- Take him in the back.

346
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,979
Wait a minute.
Seeing this guy reminds me of something.

347
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:05,216
Isn't there another
flight attendant?

348
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,224
Yeah, the cute one
with blonde hair.

349
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:10,489
- She's in with the others.
- Are you sure?

350
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,531
- Will you trust me?
-All right. Go.

351
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,963
Damn it.

352
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:21,199
- Anybody got a cell phone ?
-[Woman]There's no air down here.

353
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,139
Hello ? It's the 21st century.

354
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,234
- Anybody got a cell phone?
-Sir.

355
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:31,545
Yeah. Spare me the lecture--
"No cell phones while airborne."

356
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,085
- [ Beeping]
- This is crap! Anybody got P.C.S. ?

357
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:37,087
- Sir, it won't work.
- Yeah, like you'd know.

358
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,852
Yes, sir, I would know.
We're right near the avionics bay.

359
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,858
It's causing
too much interference.

360
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:45,157
- [ Beeping]
- Shit! Shit!

361
00:32:45,229 --> 00:32:47,721
We're all gonna die!
They're gonna kill us all, you know.

362
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,461
Wait a minute. Calm down.
We don't know that.

363
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:54,904
If we remain calm and do as they say,
we have a good chance of surviving.

364
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,204
Where'd they teach you that,
airborne waitress school ?

365
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,973
You listen to me.
If you can't remain calm,

366
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:03,139
then at least shut up.

367
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:05,273
Sir.

368
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:09,082
Americans suffer every day
all over the world...

369
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,281
because of men like you.

370
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,553
Backroom Judases jockeying
for political position.

371
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:18,084
You played footsies with our enemy
when you should be strong.

372
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:21,860
You have no concept
of diplomacy, Sykes.

373
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,630
It's an entirely
different game.

374
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:28,138
[Scoffs] You see, that's where
you and I differ, General.

375
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:30,140
I never thought of it
as a game.

376
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:34,145
There was a time when terrorists
were afraid to strike America...

377
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:36,203
for fear of what we'd do.

378
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,612
But we've become
a laughing stock nation.

379
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,777
What are you now,
if not a terrorist ?

380
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:52,427
- A patriot.
- Oh, spare me the speeches.

381
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,558
If you're going to kill me,
just do it and get it over with.

382
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,466
Who said I was gonna kill you ?

383
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:03,600
Mr. Garner, Mr. Ferris,
bring the stewardess...

384
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,938
-to the cockpit, if you please.
- Roger.

385
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,445
- Mr. Dalton, business class.
- Roger.

386
00:34:08,513 --> 00:34:11,175
Enjoy the flight, General.
I'll be back shortly.

387
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:19,413
Don't worry. If we just stay calm,
everything will be--

388
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,193
It's okay.
It's okay.

389
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,923
Everything will be okay.

390
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,762
Just relax. I'm gonna
borrow her for just a minute.

391
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:32,292
Don't worry.
It'll be okay. Don't worry.

392
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,771
[Hijacker]Hey, so you got any steak
on this plane, darlin'?

393
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:36,830
[Continues, Indistinct]

394
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:44,374
- [Grunts]
- What are you doing ?

395
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:47,180
Take the broad up there.
I'm gonna hang out down here.

396
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,781
- Come on, sweetheart.
- Take it easy.

397
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:10,336
[Clattering]

398
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,485
- [Shrieks]
- [Groans]

399
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:39,530
- [Grunts]
- [Screams]

400
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:57,521
Captain, contact Dulles Tower.
I want to speak to the man in charge.

401
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:04,056
Ted, Flight 777...

402
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,392
they're requesting
to speak with you.

403
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:08,899
To me ? What do they want
to talk to me about ?

404
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:11,367
- This is Dulles Tower.
- Identify yourself.

405
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:15,463
This is Ted Bigelow, air traffic
administrator. Who am I speaking to ?

406
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,373
Who I am is unimportant.

407
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:23,209
Flight 777 is under hostile control,
so pay very close attention.

408
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:28,919
State your name
and employee ID number.

409
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:34,384
Gwen Richards.
Employee number 2109-C.

410
00:36:36,327 --> 00:36:39,319
Now, Miss Richards
has been very cooperative...

411
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:43,425
so obviously your anti-hijacking
training has paid off.

412
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,435
Congratulations.

413
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:46,698
[Groans]

414
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:53,235
What you just heard was the sound
of Miss Richards being shot.

415
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:57,976
Not fatally but if she doesn't
get medical attention in, let's say

416
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,445
oh, I don't know,
three hours...

417
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,988
she'll bleed to death.

418
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,923
So... now that I have
your attention...

419
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:11,587
I want a $100 million
wire transfer...

420
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:14,859
to an account in the
Grand Cayman Merchant Bank...

421
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:17,492
number 8654...

422
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,536
dash 197

423
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:23,006
We're just air traffic control.
We don't have that kind of access.

424
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,600
That's not my concern.

425
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:29,442
But if the money hasn't been transferred
by the time we've landed the plane...

426
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:34,075
I will kill every
passenger on this flight.

427
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:37,052
Flight 777, out.

428
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:39,215
Wait, wait. Hold on.

429
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:44,623
Oh, my--
All right.

430
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:49,656
All right, people! Standard
hijack protocol. Total news blackout.

431
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,533
Notify the FBI.
Somebody get me a passenger manifest.

432
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,571
I wanna know
who's on that plane!

433
00:37:57,074 --> 00:38:00,066
Mr. Garner, take Miss Richards
to the aft luggage bay.

434
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,306
[Whimpering]

435
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:05,281
[Groaning]

436
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:17,286
Mr. Davis, make sure these men
maintain radio silence. Thank you.

437
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,280
I had our people red-flag
any possible V.I.P. targets.

438
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,440
We found one.

439
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,378
Allen Prescott.
Why does that sound familiar?

440
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:45,184
He's on the news. Appointed cochairman
of the senate's intelligence committee.

441
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,953
That's got to be our connection.
Any word from the FBI ?

442
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,959
They've been ordered
to stand down.

443
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:52,997
Victor Quinn,
National Security Agency.

444
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:55,533
- You're Bigelow ?
- That's right.

445
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,533
From now on,
this is an N.S.A. operation.

446
00:38:57,601 --> 00:39:00,696
- Each of you is subject to my orders.
- Wait a minute.

447
00:39:00,771 --> 00:39:02,705
How do you know
the plane was hijacked ?

448
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:06,300
Do you honestly believe
that the N.S.A. would allow...

449
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:08,937
someone like General Prescott
to travel commercial...

450
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,482
and not constantly monitor
the plane's communication ?

451
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:15,486
Anymore foolish questions?
No?

452
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:18,989
Fine.
Then let's get down to business.

453
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:22,492
- There was a ransom demand for--
- 100 million dollars. Yes, we know.

454
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,619
But that's not
his primary objective.

455
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:26,663
- How do you know ?
- It's classified.

456
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,257
Classified, my ass.
There's a nutcase on that plane.

457
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,802
He just shot one of our flight
attendants while we listened.

458
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,839
[Speed Dialing cellphone]

459
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:38,432
Yeah. It's all secure at this end.
Send in the wolves.

460
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,314
We're going into this one blind

461
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:48,876
We don't know how many hijackers
are on board or how well armed they are.

462
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:52,082
We don't know if they have
a man undercover or men undercover.

463
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,352
It's impossible but doable.

464
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:57,588
But they're cruising at 25,000 feet.
How do we get there ?

465
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,687
- Flap our arms?
- Pentagon's working with Skunk Works.

466
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:05,532
They've modified an SR-71 spy plane
to move in an attack force.

467
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:08,265
It's equipped with
a retractable docking tube.

468
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,774
- Sounds tough.
- I've seen simulations.

469
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,866
I know the pilot.
He's a good one.

470
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,911
He can belly this
plane up right to the bar.

471
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:18,438
- Nobody will ever know we're there.
- Where do we board ?

472
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:21,747
Right through here--
auxiliary storage hatch.

473
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,880
We're gonna have to deactivate the
outer pressure hatch alarm or else...

474
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:27,447
the light will show up,
and they'll know we're there.

475
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:30,620
- I can rig something.
- I'm sure you can.

476
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:33,129
At that point, we'll move
through the support bay.

477
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:35,359
Cujo and Banzai,
you've got the starboard side.

478
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:39,131
Deadman and me will be
on the port side.

479
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:43,162
We'll input a fast-acting sleep agent
into the onboard oxygen system.

480
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,538
We'll be wearing our rebreathers,
so we'll be okay.

481
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,340
At that point the pilot
will be unconscious...

482
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:51,143
and Deadman, you are going to
land this plane.

483
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:54,378
I knew those correspondence classes
would come in handy someday.

484
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,980
- Do they want prisoners ?
- Special ops sanctioned maximum force.

485
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:03,493
Prisoners are low priority. That means
they got a gun, they get a bullet.

- [Controls Beeping]
- [ Engine Whirring]

487
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:38,780

proceed to runway 36 and hold short.

488
00:42:38,856 --> 00:42:41,120

00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:44,286

302, you are clear for takeoff
Proceed to way Point-one heading 249.

495
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,851
Roger that. 249.

496
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:12,212
Gentlemen,
relax and enjoy the ride.

497
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:29,891
Yeah. Understood.

498
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:33,460
I'd ask what that's all about,
but you'd tell me it was classified.

499
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:37,974
[Sighs] You think
I'm a stone-cold bastard, don't you ?

500
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:45,039
- I'll take the Fifth.
- Uh-huh. I am a stone-cold bastard.

501
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:48,642
See, I order men
to their deaths all the time.

502
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,745
But I don't get off on it.
It's my job.

503
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,984
You're telling me this because--

504
00:44:54,058 --> 00:44:55,992
Because now it's time
for you to play your part.

505
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:00,361
We have a black ops team on its way
to assault that aircraft in midair.

506
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:02,900
- They're five minutes out.
- That's insane.

507
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:05,230
Well, that's probably why
it's gonna work.

508
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:07,930
In five minutes, I want you
on-line with the hijackers.

509
00:45:08,005 --> 00:45:11,635
You're going to tell them you found
a source for the ransom money

510
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,973
And what purpose
will that serve ?

511
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:18,447
I need you to distract them
while our team boards the aircraft.

512
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:20,643
In the meantime, I'd like to see
the security camera video feed...

513
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,915
from the terminal
that boarded Flight 777.

514
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:26,820
Would you see
to that for me ?

515
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:31,120
I'm on it.

516
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,527
Good.

517
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:46,100
Freedom 2, we have our W.S.
radar contact. Closing at 249.

518
00:45:46,176 --> 00:45:49,874
Gentlemen, we are three minutes away
stealth mode is active.

519
00:45:49,947 --> 00:45:52,075
We read you.

520
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:54,117
Gentlemen, that was
the three-minute warning.

521
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:56,118
[ Exhales Sharply]

522
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:10,298
Ironic, isn't it-- being hijacked on
your way to an anti-terrorist summit?

523
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,995
I don't know what
you're talking about.

524
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,802
Lying's become automatic
for you, hasn't it ?

525
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:19,536
Do you even know when
you're telling the truth ?

526
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,672
[Sighs]
This is what we do, Sykes.

527
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:26,045
You know that.
You've done it yourself.

528
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,949
You're absolutely right.

529
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:32,512
We lie under oath.
We swear to the U.S. Senate...

530
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:36,583
that we've never turned a blind eye
to the South American drug dealers...

531
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,594
in exchange for driving out
the communists.

532
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:41,097
We lie to the American people,
telling them...

533
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:43,361
we've got their best interests
at heart...

534
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:47,165
and then we expose our sons
and brothers to biological agents...

535
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,535
during Desert Storm
that we know...

536
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:52,667
will cause their children
to be born malformed.

537
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,768
There's no proof of that.

538
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,906
More importantly
we lie to ourselves...

539
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:01,178
so that we can get up every day,
look in the mirror...

540
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,242
and convince our minds...

541
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,221
that we're different
from those we're fighting.

542
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:11,592
We are different!
We stand for a higher ideal.

543
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,222
[Chuckles]
There you go again.

544
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,362
Colonel, Dulles Tower
is requesting to speak to you.

545
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,803
I was wondering
how long that would take.

546
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:26,002
Sit tight, General.
The party's just getting started.

547
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:42,484
- Yes.
- This is Bigelow.

548
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,325
You might want to know we've gained
access to the amount you asked for.

549
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,259
I'm very impressed,
Mr. Bigelow.

- Major Marshall, stand by for boarding.
- Standing by.

553
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:05,507
Have you arranged
the wire transfer?

554
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:08,108
Uh, no.
We're still working on it.

555
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:12,418
Work faster, Mr. Bigelow.
Time waits for no man.

556
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:20,487
- We're inline. Extend the tube, Major.

R.W.R. to slave.

561
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:39,073
It's just that
we need more time.

562
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,811
The money is coming from
three different sources.

563
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:45,219
That sort of complicates
the transfer process.

564
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,155
I'm not an unreasonable man,
but my demands are firm.

565
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:53,424
The money will be in my account
by the time we land...

on this flight.

-We have pressure.

Okay, let's go.

Set.

the docking tube. Good luck, men.

574
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:17,477
[Sighs]
Excellent. Good.

575
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:20,209
You should get an award,
Mr. Bigelow.

576
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:23,947
Our men are safely on board that plane,
thanks in part to your performance.

577
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:27,514
Yeah.
All right. Now what ?

578
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:30,583
Now comes the hard part.
We wait.

579
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:35,291
- Com check.
- Check.

580
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,801
- Sleep agent ?
- Bedtime for Bonzo.

581
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,839
All right.
Deadman and I will do recon.

582
00:50:41,905 --> 00:50:46,069

bay and implement the sleep agent.

- Let's do this.
- Copy that.

Drop that gun !
Drop that gun !

586
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:38,692
- Who are you ?
- A flight attendant. Who are you ?

00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,730
We're the good guys.
We're here to help.

588
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:45,496
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, just scared.

589
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:49,529
Watch her.

590
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:53,201
- Team two. There's a change in plans.
- Say again ?

591
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,904
Forget the sleep agent.
We're going to attack...

592
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:57,970
using flash-bangs
and side arms.

593
00:51:58,048 --> 00:52:00,244
What about hostages ?
We've got a live one down here.

594
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:04,584
Not in the equation. Rendezvous with us
in 30 seconds at the aft stairwell.

595
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:08,682
- Copy that. Team two on the way.
- Stay put, okay?

596
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:26,842
Back of the plane
has been cleared.

597
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,844
Targets are definitely
in the front.

- Sounds like more gun shots, genius.

00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:09,706
I know it was gunshots, Pops.
I mean, why did it get so quiet ?

612
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:25,758
You were very quick about blocking
my view to the outer hatch alarm.

- But not quick enough.

- Do you see any potentials ?
- Not yet.

- What are you looking for, exactly?
- A face.

617
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:53,747
You got a mental picture of every
terrorist and hijacker in the world ?

618
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:56,019
No, just the ones
that are still at large.

619
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,588
Actually, this is
a pretty simple task.

620
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:01,995
I'm just looking
for one particular face.

621
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,436
And there it is.

622
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:10,565
John Sykes, colonel,
United States Marine Corps.

623
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,405
Why would
a marine hijack a 747 ?

624
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,911
General Prescott was chief judge
adjutant at Sykes' court-martial.

625
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:20,041
He promised Sykes a lenient sentence
if he would plead guilty.

626
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:22,517
He did.
Prescott threw the book at him.

627
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:26,544
So Sykes wants him dead.
Makes sense.

628
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,614
Yeah, but not
for the reasons you think.

629

runway ready to launch at my command.

Look, I understand that.
But we have new intel...

632
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:44,704
that shortens the odds
against our team.

633
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:50,403
Look, if we don't hear from them
by the prearranged time...

634
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,745
I want that 747
blown out of the sky.

00:55:55,485 --> 00:55:57,510
You want what ?

636
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,423
You have any idea how many
passengers are on that plane ?

637
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:05,621
If our team can't retake that plane,
Sykes cannot be allowed to escape.

638

point of view, lady.

- Oh, let me help with that. Okay.
- Hey.

Worse than what I thought.
Bullet's lodged in the muscle.

- Is that why it's bleeding so bad ?
- It's bad, okay?

00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:04,309
south-southeast.

660
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,315
Very good.
Bearing 619.

661
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:11,320
- Where are we going ?
- Just fly the plane, Captain.

662
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:15,153
Well, Mr. Davis, now that the inevitable
rescue attempt has been dealt with...

663
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,159
we can get on
with our true mission.

664
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:20,060
How long before the rescue team
is considered overdue, sir?

665
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:22,257
Long enough.

666
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:25,495
Watch him carefully,
Mr. Davis.

667
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:37,678
How many of them
bastards are there ?

668
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:40,239
There were five at first.

669
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,250
I got one of them.

670
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:45,310
Don't take this personal,

671
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:48,881
but to me it doesn't look
like you could kill a fly.

672
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:51,393
What's their position?

673
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:55,398
One I'm sure about is in the cockpit.
I don't know where the others are.

674
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:58,059
- Hostages ?
- They marched them...

675
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:00,330
out of the passenger compartments
and I--

676
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:03,600
They must have stashed them
in the aft luggage bay.

677
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:07,769
- What about you ?
- Uh, someone spilled a drink on me...

678
00:59:07,844 --> 00:59:11,246
and I was cleaning off when these guys
took over the plane.

679
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:13,408
I guess they overlooked me.

680
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:15,713
[Sniffs]

681
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:22,425
- Lucky you.
- What are you doing ?

682
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:25,553
Sit down or you'll
start bleeding worse.

683
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,562
Well, that's just
a chance I got to take.

684
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,826
I got to get this plane
under control.

685
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,335
You're in no condition
to do anything.

686
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,337
[Groans]

687
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,272
This is what I do, lady.

688
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:43,177
What's that ?

689
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,580
It's a sleeping agent, not that
it's gonna do us any good right now.

690
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:49,516
- Why?
- Can you land a 747 ?

691
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,749
- No.
- Putting that pilot to sleep...

692
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:54,756
right now isn't the best idea.

693
00:59:54,824 --> 00:59:57,191
Somebody's got to get
this plane on the ground.

694
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,525
Now, if I can get
into the avionics bay

695
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:04,534
I can probably trigger the fuel dump.
Then they gotta land the plane.

696
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:09,496
Delta Force will take
the plane out on the ground.

697
01:00:09,572 --> 01:00:11,506
I can do it.

698
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:14,441
- The hell, you can do it.
- Why?

699
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:18,003
-'Cause I'm a helpless girl ?
- Exactly You're a helpless girl

700
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:22,780
You sure as hell can't do it.
Who's gonna do it if not me ?

701
01:00:30,259 --> 01:00:33,229
Come here.

702
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,624
Put this on.

703
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:48,069
- You receiving ?
- I--

704
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:50,169
I hear you.

705
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:53,238
But I heard one of the hijackers
say that the avionics bay...

706
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:57,082
- makes interference for com systems.
- You'll be all right.

707
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,145
These are micro-burst transmitters,
okay? State of the art.

708
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,317
Now, move.

709
01:01:02,392 --> 01:01:04,554
When you get
to the avionics bay,

710
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:08,427
I'll walk you through
the connection process.

711
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,866
You said you wanted
to be a soldier. Do it!

712
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,211
I should've joined
the coast guard.

713
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:34,389
Okay, I'm here.
Now what ?

714
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:37,552
Move to the maintenance panel
that's on the wall to your right.

715
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,757
Okay, I'm there
and it's open. Now what ?

716
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:49,237
Okay, you should see three wires
connected to two regulator boxes.

717
01:01:49,305 --> 01:01:51,239
Two wires, where ?

718
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:53,969
Three wires, two boxes.
Listen up.

719
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,774
Okay, don't yell at me.
Okay, I see them.

720
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:59,577
You see a red and a blue wire ?
Disconnect it.

721
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:22,068
- Okay. Now what ?
- Twist the red and blue wire together.

722
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:35,318
Now what ?

723
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:38,251
Get the hell out of there.

724
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:45,084
-[Beeping]
-What the hell is that ?

725
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:49,359
- We're losing fuel, fast.
- What did you do ? What did you do ?

726
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,594
Nothing.
I didn't do anything.

727
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,500
Well, now that we've taken
care of any distractions,

728
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,698
let's get to it, shall we ?

729
01:02:56,773 --> 01:03:00,971
You don't actually think they're gonna
let you live after this, do you ?

730
01:03:01,043 --> 01:03:05,844
I'll see to it that you're hunted
to every last corner of the earth.

731
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:09,317
Well, that's based on the notion that
you're still alive when this is over...

732
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:11,319
or that anyone will listen.

733
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:14,084
You're not making any sense.

734
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:19,527
That's a lovely attaché case you've
got there, General. Italian leather?

735
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:24,032
- There's nothing there. Just documents.
- Oh.

736
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:27,001
- Colonel, we've got a problem.
- What is it ?

737
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:29,902
- We're dumping fuel.
- Fuel ? How's that possible ?

738
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,997
I don't know.
The pilot says he didn't do it.

739
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:35,908
Then someone else did.

740
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:40,575
Someone who knows what they're doing.
You sure our guests are really dead ?

741
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,109
- They don't make them deader, sir.
- Garner, check the avionics bay.

742
01:03:44,187 --> 01:03:47,316
Make sure the fuel regulator
hasn't been tampered with.

743
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,324
Got you, boss.

744
01:03:49,392 --> 01:03:54,296
Ferris, go make sure all those
assaulters are really dead.

745
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:56,457
Ferris, respond.

746
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:58,466
- Where is he ?
- Haven't seen him.

747
01:03:58,534 --> 01:04:03,165
Well, go find him. And if he's
goldbricking, shoot the son of a bitch.

748
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:10,368
[ Kelly On Headset]
Matt, you still there ?

749
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:13,279
- Yeah, where are you ?
- Out of sight.

750
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:16,250
Heads up.
Someone's coming your way.

751
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,448
They're probably just
checking on the fuel spill.

752
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,786
Let's hope
we got rid of enough.

753
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:25,385
- You stay out of sight.
- Got you.

754
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,092
Always carry a spare.

755
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:40,101
Nice.

756
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:49,411
Fuel dump halted, Colonel.

757
01:04:49,485 --> 01:04:53,319
- What's our fuel status ?
- We can make Miami if we're careful.

758
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:55,949
Damn it!
Keep me informed. Out.

759
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:59,484
Problems, Colonel ?

760
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:02,793
Don't push me, General.
Sometimes I forget my manners.

761
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:17,145
They're dead.

762
01:05:41,103 --> 01:05:43,936
[Gunshot]

763
01:05:51,514 --> 01:05:53,448
[Groaning]

764
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:56,508
- You okay?
- That depends on your definition.

765
01:05:56,585 --> 01:05:59,350
- Let me look at that leg wound.
- Look, look, get away.

766
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:01,356
God, what is your problem ?

767
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:04,758
Did your mother take your
blanket away too early or what ?

768
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:08,695
Cute. Now stay out of the way
and let the big boys do their job.

769
01:06:08,764 --> 01:06:11,199
What are you planning ?
You can't even stand.

770
01:06:11,267 --> 01:06:14,134
- Says you.
- We weren't using the sleeping gas.

771
01:06:14,203 --> 01:06:19,198
Got no choice. I got some
smelling salts in my first aid kit.

772
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:22,006
Hopefully, I'll be able
to revive the pilot.

773
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:26,882
Hey, Ferris.

774
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:46,766
Colonel, I found Ferris.
He's dead, sir.

775
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,498
Damn it! Who's doing this ?

776
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:52,098
Garner, status report.

777
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,108
Garner?

778
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:57,635
Mr. Dalton, return to business class.
We got an adversary on board.

779
01:06:57,713 --> 01:06:59,112
I'm on my way.

780
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:02,708
Always something,
isn't it, Colonel ?

781
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:06,846
Shut up!

782
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:15,130
This is Quinn.
Any word from our team ?

783
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:21,235
Well, I guess we'll
have to assume the worst.

784
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:23,237
Launch the F-15s.

785
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:26,536
You gonna splash a 747
full of innocent people...

786
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:29,806
-to keep one man from getting away?
- It might not come to that.

787
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:34,043
But you're prepared to do it.
You haven't given the team enough time.

788
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:36,050
Let me tell you how this
is gonna work, all right ?

789
01:07:36,118 --> 01:07:40,316
The team has until the F-15s intercept
to retake that plane.

790
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:42,448
If they can't
retake the plane,

791
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:47,326
the F-15s will then try and
force the hijackers to land.

792
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:49,455
And if they refuse ?

793
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:52,729
Then we have to light them up.

794
01:07:55,504 --> 01:07:58,439
Initiating launch procedure.
Main engines are a go.

795
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:02,000
Course positions are locked in.

796
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:13,154
[Man On Radio]You are cleared
for takeoff on three. Have a good day

797
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:15,782
Roger that.

798
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:17,646
- Kelly. Kelly.
- Yeah, I hear you.

799
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,950
The nozzle
on this canister is bent.

800
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:24,960
Get the tape out of my first aid kit
and bring it down here.

801
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:27,997
I don't see it.
Where exactly did you leave it ?

802
01:09:28,063 --> 01:09:31,260
I left it on the floor.
Check the corner. Maybe it rolled.

803
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:35,065
- Okay, keep your pants on.
- Come on. Hurry up.

804
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:45,180
Oh. There it is.

805
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,614
Okay. I'm waiting on you.
Bring it down.

806
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:53,278
[Grunts]
Got it.

807
01:09:55,257 --> 01:09:58,522
- [Gasps]
- Hello, sweet cheeks.

808
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:09,761
Put your hands in the air
and turn around slowly.

809
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:16,910
Don't even think about it.

810
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:20,210
The colonel’s not gonna believe
what a pain in the ass you've been.

811
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,216
You don't have
to take me in, you know.

812
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:24,275
Why wouldn't I ?

813
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:29,223
Well, if I promise to be a good girl
and stop causing trouble.

814
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:33,927
Okay.
First I got to check for weapons.

815
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:37,091
- What ?
- Take the jacket off.

816
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:52,114
Now the blouse.

817
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,632
You took your
sweet time about it.

818
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:23,941
Seems like it would have been a little
better if I had waited a little longer.

819
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:27,005
Yeah.
Here's your tape, pervert.

820
01:11:28,884 --> 01:11:32,616
Okay. You said
there was five of them.

821
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:34,782
I just whacked one more.

822
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:37,155
That leaves two. You think if
I get one, you can get the other one ?

823
01:11:37,226 --> 01:11:39,524
- Hell, yes.
- All right.

824
01:11:39,595 --> 01:11:42,792
You just wait here till
I put on that canister.

825
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:46,165
Wait on my signal.
Then we take the plane.

826
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:02,846
That's Miss Sweet cheeks
to you, asshole.

827
01:12:07,056 --> 01:12:09,184
Open that case.

828
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:11,818
I told you. There's nothing in here
that would interest you.

829
01:12:11,894 --> 01:12:13,828
Oh yeah ?

830
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:27,633
Open it.

831
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:30,077
All right.
I'll open it.

832
01:12:30,145 --> 01:12:33,672
- General, don't.
- There's no point.

833
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:38,846
He just kills us and opens it himself.
It's not a bank vault.

834
01:12:42,491 --> 01:12:44,357
Sit down.

835
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,924
Thank you.

836
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:54,833
Okay. Where is it ?
Where is it ?Where is it ?

837
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,463
Where is it ?Ah. Ooh.

838
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:00,732
There it is.

839
01:13:03,445 --> 01:13:07,040
I'll make sure everyone knows
you gave your full cooperation.

840
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:11,747
And you can kiss that fancy
new position good-bye at the very least.

841
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:14,289
You are one dumb
son of a bitch.

842
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:16,381
I know.

843
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,836
Oh, shit.

844

[Yells]

845
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,376
They're still proceeding
on their new course.

846
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:12,278
Well, the F-I5s are closing in.
We'll have this wrapped up in no time.

847
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:15,044
- Yeah, but at what cost ?
- [Sighs]

848
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:18,451
Look. If I could find
a better way, I'd do it.

849
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,955
You better be right...

850
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:23,151
because if you blow
that plane out of the sky,

851
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:25,216
I'm gonna make sure
you fry for it.

852
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,423
Bigelow, let me give you
a big dose of reality okay?

853
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:32,730
Whatever happens in this situation,
whichever way it goes, I'm untouchable.

854
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:36,396
You understand that?
You don't know what's going on, do you?

855
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,406
You know what ?
I'm gonna tell you what's going on...

856
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:41,910
because maybe if I tell you what's
going on, you’ll start to cooperate.

857
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:44,912
- You know what a D.C.O. roster is?
- No.

858
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:48,939
D.C.O. stands for
deep cover operative.

859
01:14:49,017 --> 01:14:52,476
General Prescott has
in his possession a CD-ROM...

860
01:14:52,554 --> 01:14:55,489
which has pictures,
names and cover I.D.s...

861
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:59,653
of every deep cover operative
we have in the world.

862
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:04,029
Every deep cover operation right now
in the world will be compromised...

863
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:07,091
- if Sykes gets his hands on that CD.
- Jesus.

864
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,661
So, given
the worldwide ramifications,

865
01:15:09,738 --> 01:15:15,643
you can understand how a few people
on a plane can become expendable.

866
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:26,847
Honor is a fleeting concept,
isn't it, General ?

867
01:15:26,922 --> 01:15:30,119
You stole mine.
I stole yours.

868
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:35,596
I mean, how many agents did you
just compromise by giving me that disk?

869
01:15:35,664 --> 01:15:38,861
You see, General,
you are the disgrace.

870
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:42,962
You asked me before
if I was gonna kill you.

871
01:15:43,038 --> 01:15:48,067
Not a chance. I want you to
live with what you've done.

872
01:15:48,143 --> 01:15:50,237
What are you gonna do
with that disk?

873
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:53,077
Make sure it falls into
the wrong hands, of course.

874
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:57,085
I think I'll start the bidding
at, uh, 100 million.

875
01:15:57,152 --> 01:16:00,486
At the cost of hundreds
of agents' lives ?

876
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:03,651
Not likely.

877
01:16:03,725 --> 01:16:07,320
Every compromised agent will be
forced to evacuate their position.

878
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,831
Some will go state side.
Others will go into hiding.

879
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:13,596
But it'll take time for new agents
to take their position...

880
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:18,436
giving the terrorist nations a window
of opportunity to do their worst.

881
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:20,942
Good God.

882
01:16:21,009 --> 01:16:26,675

die as a result of such an action ?

However, unless you
give yourself up immediately

- Yeah.

They don't know about you.

If I turn myself in,
you've probably got a chance.

You got to get to the top flight deck
and pop that guy with the gun.

Hello. Hello.
Is anybody there ?

They've leveled off, Base One,

- Dead ! He's dead. They're all dead.

Check your altimeter.

We can land her in Atlanta.
