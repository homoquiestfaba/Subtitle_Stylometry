1
00:00:02,215 --> 00:00:04,715
(tense music)

2
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:20,370
- [Claire] God damn it,
pass this asshole.

3
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,050
- [Ben] It's a double yellow.

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,600
The double yellow is
there because the driver...

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:27,601
- [Claire] I know what a fuckin'
double yellow line means.

6
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:29,850
(tense music)

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,029
My cell phone has no reception.

8
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,120
(tense music)

9
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,197
Oh my God, what are we
even doing out here?

10
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:40,747
(tense music)

11
00:00:42,244 --> 00:00:45,077
(tires squealing)

12
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:50,850
(Ben Sighs)

13
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,700
- God damn it.

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,330
Tomorrow's 10 years.

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,650
So, we're gettin' away.

16
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,492
It's what people do I guess.

17
00:00:58,542 --> 00:00:59,910
(Claire smirks)

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,320
- No, you know what?

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,118
This weekend we'll get
out of our comfort zones,

20
00:01:04,168 --> 00:01:08,500
we'll get some fresh air.

21
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,313
We'll finally open that bottle.

22
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,320
- We used to be a great team.

23
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,680
How did we end up here?

24
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,107
So far away from each other.

25
00:01:23,157 --> 00:01:25,657
(tense music)

26
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,500
- Look if, if we wanna
change what we have

27
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,493
we have to stop fighting each other.

28
00:01:33,466 --> 00:01:35,541
We have to start fighting
for each other.

29
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:38,091
(tense music)

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,486
Otherwise fuck it.

31
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,036
(tense music)

32
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,443
So what's it gonna be?

33
00:01:53,277 --> 00:01:55,000
(Ben sighs)

34
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,550
(tense music)

35
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:15,445
(tense music)
(cicadas chirping)

36
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:27,229
(tense music)
(wheels clattering)

37
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:33,162
(footsteps approaching)

38
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:37,688
(Ben sighs)

39
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:40,405
(birds singing)

40
00:02:45,692 --> 00:02:48,275
(Claire sighs)

41
00:02:54,363 --> 00:02:55,146
(wood splitting)

42
00:02:55,196 --> 00:02:58,594
(logs clattering)

43
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:00,926
(jacket rustling)

44
00:03:00,976 --> 00:03:02,087
(wood splitting)

45
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:03,827
(Ben chuckles)

46
00:03:03,877 --> 00:03:07,019
(birds singing)
(Ben gasping)

47
00:03:07,069 --> 00:03:12,069
(logs clattering)
(gentle music)

48
00:03:21,565 --> 00:03:22,348
(Ben sighs)

49
00:03:22,398 --> 00:03:23,231
- Hey you.

50
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:25,073
- [Ben] Hey.

51
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,333
- Mm, look at you.

52
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:29,370
You got all sweaty out there.

53
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,203
- Yeah?

54
00:03:30,253 --> 00:03:31,522
You like that?

55
00:03:31,572 --> 00:03:32,811
- [Claire] A little actually.

56
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:33,644
- Yeah?

57
00:03:33,694 --> 00:03:34,477
(Claire giggles)

58
00:03:34,527 --> 00:03:36,008
- Here, I'll take this for you.

59
00:03:36,058 --> 00:03:38,090
(gentle music)

60
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,973
- Thanks.

61
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,090
- Ready for some wine?

62
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,780
- I'm gonna take a quick shower.

63
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,080
(footsteps retreating)

64
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:51,690
(Claire sighs)

65
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,187
(footsteps approaching)

66
00:03:54,237 --> 00:03:55,260
(gloves thudding)

67
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,810
(glass thuds)

68
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,062
- Hey, I'm gonna run to the store.

69
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:03,779
(keys jingling)

70
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:07,149
(door slams)

71
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,020
(Ben sighs)

72
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,320
(footsteps retreating)

73
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:16,076
(typewriter keys clacking)

74
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:19,629
(typewriter dings)

75
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:24,679
(crickets chirping)
(people chattering)

76
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:33,299
(tense music)

77
00:04:41,596 --> 00:04:42,960
(Claire's throat clearing)

78
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,335
- What's um, what's goin' on here?

79
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,730
- I'm making Tom Collins.

80
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,720
- I can see that.

81
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,950
- Here, this one's for you.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,780
(glass thuds)

83
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,314
- Who are these people?

84
00:04:54,364 --> 00:04:56,720
(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

85
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,963
- These are my guests.

86
00:04:58,013 --> 00:05:00,719
(ice cubes clinking)
(tense music)

87
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:03,193
Well, our guests, now.

88
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:07,280
They are having some car trouble and...

89
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,713
- And your wife was generous
enough to give us a ride.

90
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,910
Name's Tyler.

91
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,793
- [Ben] Ben.

92
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,803
Excuse me, I need to talk with my wife.

93
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:21,830
Hm?

94
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,130
- Sorry, we'll just be one moment.

95
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,400
(footsteps retreating)

96
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,590
- [Claire] Let's be honest.

97
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,423
- Great.

98
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:27,256
- [Claire] This.

99
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:28,089
- This what?

100
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,292
- [Claire] Us, here alone this weekend?

101
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:32,290
- What about it?

102
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,450
- [Claire] We would've
killed each other, come on.

103
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,450
We woulda torn each other to pieces.

104
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,980
- We came out with the intention

105
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,146
of not doing that.
- Oh my God, intention?

106
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:41,250
(Claire laughs)

107
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,430
Oh my God!

108
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:45,130
What did you think was
gonna happen out here?

109
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,190
We're gonna fall back in love?

110
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,300
Huh?

111
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,060
We're gonna snuggle up
on the couch by the fire

112
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,939
and profess how wrong
we've been to each other?

113
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:54,293
- Whatever was gonna happen,

114
00:05:54,343 --> 00:05:57,520
was gonna happen with you and me.

115
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:00,840
Not you, me, Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

116
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,220
- Oh just stop.

117
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,830
(crickets chirping)

118
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,508
- Who are these people?

119
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:08,341
(Claire scoffs)

120
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:09,930
- They're people.

121
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,763
Okay?

122
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:13,070
When, when's the last time
that you met somebody?

123
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,950
- What?

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,816
- New people?

125
00:06:14,866 --> 00:06:17,137
Interesting people?

126
00:06:17,187 --> 00:06:18,240
- Oh.

127
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,280
Oh they're, they're interesting.

128
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,420
- Yeah.

129
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,363
They are.

130
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,310
He's, he's a real story teller.

131
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,670
And she (sighs), you know I think

132
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,360
she's a little bit too young for him.

133
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,800
I can see that.

134
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,633
- Can you?

135
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:34,551
- [Claire] Yeah, yeah.

136
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:37,450
He needs a woman, not a little girl.

137
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,780
Oh you know what I notice is that

138
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,740
most men wanna be the
hero or perceived as such.

139
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:43,061
So maybe they have that...
- I know what this is.

140
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,440
(crickets chirping)

141
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:46,323
- Do tell.

142
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,610
- You think I don't know you?

143
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,233
You think I haven't seen every
look you've ever given me?

144
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,560
- What are you talking about?

145
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,540
- Before you left?

146
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,060
- [Claire] Before I left what?

147
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,410
- Offering me a glass
of wine the way you did.

148
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,082
- [Claire] What about it?

149
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,650
(crickets chirping)

150
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,600
- You wanted to fuck me.

151
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,962
- Oh you're insane.

152
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:09,795
- Am I?

153
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:11,180
- Yeah.

154
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,063
You are.

155
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:14,763
- Do you wanna know what I do want?

156
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,892
A drink.

157
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:18,790
(Ben scoffs)

158
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,417
We're helping these
people because we can,

159
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:24,050
and if this situation were reversed,

160
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,560
how lucky would we be to meet

161
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,492
such courteous strangers as us?

162
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,350
(Claire chuckles)

163
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,170
They're staying the night.

164
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,400
Nobody's cell phones have reception.

165
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,800
- We know nothing about them!

166
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,633
How could you bring them...

167
00:07:35,683 --> 00:07:37,270
- Let's get to know them shall we?

168
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,300
Come.

169
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,185
Have a drink.

170
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:41,529
You might even have a little fun.

171
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:46,579
(gentle music)
(crickets chirping)

172
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:50,931
(Ben sighs)

173
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:53,071
(door sliding)

174
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:56,121
(crickets chirping)

175
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,147
- So uh, you two are havin'
some sort of car trouble?

176
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:08,665
(owl hooting)
(crickets chirping)

177
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:09,548
- Yeah.

178
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,365
We got a flat tire.

179
00:08:11,415 --> 00:08:12,214
(Ben groans)

180
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:17,264
(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

181
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,160
- Where are you two from?

182
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:24,003
- Oh, Lucy's from Santa Fe.

183
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:27,230
You know, I never been good
at answerin' that question.

184
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,323
I've moved so much.

185
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,629
- [Ben] What brought you both out here?

186
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,679
(crickets chirping)

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,833
- What do you?

188
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,763
- I'm an accounts manager.

189
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,495
- What did you wanna do?

190
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:44,866
(crickets chirping)

191
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:45,702
(Tyler grunts)

192
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:47,610
(crickets chirping)

193
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,610
- Yeah I know it's uh,
horribly depressing (sighs).

194
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,493
- Hm.

195
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,135
- I had this uh, grand idea of

196
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:59,088
writing the great American novel.

197
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,810
(crickets chirping)

198
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,963
- You still can.

199
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,990
- What about you?

200
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,019
What do you uh, do out in Santa Fe?

201
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:09,934
- Oh (laughs).

202
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:12,550
Uh, I don't do nothin' in Santa Fe.

203
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,383
I was just comin' back from

204
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:15,454
workin' a crab season up in Alaska.

205
00:09:15,504 --> 00:09:16,637
- Oh.

206
00:09:16,687 --> 00:09:19,833
What's that like, out there on the boat?

207
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,293
- Man it's uh, it's hell
no doubt about that.

208
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,060
Food you eat's terrible.

209
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,810
Lot of the guys on board the ship,

210
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,390
they been to jail so there's

211
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,330
constantly a fight breakin' out.

212
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,355
- [Ben] Have you been in many fights?

213
00:09:34,405 --> 00:09:35,611
(Tyler laughs)

214
00:09:35,661 --> 00:09:38,639
- Yeah I've gotten my ass
kicked a few good times.

215
00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:39,981
- [Ben] You bein' modest?

216
00:09:40,031 --> 00:09:41,250
(Tyler chuckles)

217
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,380
- But, you get on the right boat you can

218
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,570
make some good money which I happened

219
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,020
to do in the last few years.

220
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,380
It's mostly luck though.

221
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,780
You get on an unlucky
boat, you make nothin'.

222
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,613
You know?

223
00:09:54,663 --> 00:09:56,949
Imagine spendin', a few months on

224
00:09:56,999 --> 00:10:00,070
a floating shit hole and
walkin' away with nothin'.

225
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,970
It's no wonder that a lot of
those guys end up in prison.

226
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:05,292
- Yeah.

227
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:08,627
- But for me it was never
really about the money.

228
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:12,533
It's (laughs), it's strange.

229
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,320
There's something about a rocking

230
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:18,312
boat that makes me feel stable.

231
00:10:18,362 --> 00:10:21,900
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

232
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:24,190
Both my folks died when I was young.

233
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,990
I think I move so much now just to,

234
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,115
keep my mind busy, to not feel alone.

235
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:32,880
(crickets chirping)

236
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,540
- You're out there seein' the world.

237
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,883
Experiencin' things.

238
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,863
Definitely beats workin' in a cubicle.

239
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,792
- You're a good guy Ben, I can tell.

240
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:48,110
(crickets chirping)

241
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,270
You were probably taught
at a young age that

242
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,960
a good life is a safe
and predictable life

243
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,610
and maybe now you're realizing
that that's not true.

244
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,670
You might be worried
that you've nourished

245
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,621
the seeds of complacency and fear

246
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:08,097
for too long and now the
roots have grown too deep.

247
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:09,430
(Ben smirks)

248
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,313
- Yeah.

249
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,443
Pretty smart.

250
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,293
- And so get control.

251
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,247
You know?

252
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:19,220
Get your hands dirty.

253
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,470
Drive 'em into the dirt.

254
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,833
Rip apart those roots.

255
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:25,394
- Yeah.

256
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,533
- We have the choice,

257
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,880
to hunt the demons that haunt our lives.

258
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,670
(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

259
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,020
We have the choice to
grab them by the throat.

260
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,855
The choice to never loosen our grip.

261
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:46,170
(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

262
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,028
The choice to kill that
thing before it kills us.

263
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:55,078
(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

264
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,683
You know what that thing
might be for you?

265
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,590
(door sliding)

266
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,130
- Why don't you come inside
and make that fire now?

267
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,076
- [Ben] Yeah.

268
00:12:04,126 --> 00:12:05,440
(crickets chirping)

269
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,779
(door sliding)

270
00:12:06,829 --> 00:12:09,829
(crickets chirping)

271
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:14,736
(fire crackling)

272
00:12:20,604 --> 00:12:23,030
- [Lucy] I was just upstairs
and I saw your typewriter.

273
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,033
Are you a writer?

274
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:26,458
(Lucy laughs)

275
00:12:26,508 --> 00:12:27,291
- [Ben] No (laughs).

276
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:28,380
- [Claire] Why did you bring it?

277
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,476
- Excuse me darling but
I'm talking to our guest.

278
00:12:31,526 --> 00:12:32,740
(Claire scoffs)

279
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,015
- [Claire] Excuse me?

280
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:34,850
(Ben sighs)

281
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,170
Don't excuse me, I just
asked you a question.

282
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,605
- Yeah, yes you did.

283
00:12:39,655 --> 00:12:42,687
But out of turn and out of line.

284
00:12:42,737 --> 00:12:46,304
And out of respect, I'm gonna
continue talkin' to Lucy.

285
00:12:46,354 --> 00:12:48,000
(Claire laughs)

286
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,169
- Go right ahead.

287
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:52,469
(footsteps retreating)

288
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,543
- What do you do?

289
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:56,640
Are you goin' to school or?

290
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,180
- Yeah I'm, taking classes
to be a hairstylist.

291
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,530
- Have you always wanted
to be a hairstylist?

292
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,363
- [Lucy] Yeah.

293
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:06,170
- So, you're passionate about it?

294
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,199
- Absolutely.

295
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:08,960
Passionate.

296
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,951
- That's great.

297
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:11,515
Having passion for...

298
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:13,520
- [Claire] What do you
know about passion?

299
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,810
- Excuse me?

300
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,892
- What, do you know, about passion?

301
00:13:18,942 --> 00:13:20,450
(tense music)

302
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,180
- I know it's an amazing
thing to have (sighs),

303
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,190
and if you have it you should do it,

304
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,460
and the people closest to you

305
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,838
should encourage it, not destroy it.

306
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:31,350
(tense music)

307
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,391
- Destroy?

308
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:34,620
(Claire laughs)

309
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,150
Ask him who bought him
that thing up there.

310
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,780
- What is this?

311
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:39,780
What do you think you are?

312
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,330
Some shining example of someone

313
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,590
that went after their dreams?

314
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,020
- My dreams were your dreams.

315
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,593
- That's a fucking cop out.

316
00:13:46,874 --> 00:13:51,874
(gentle music)
(fire crackling)

317
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,193
- I had my dream.

318
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,228
For a minute, I was right there.

319
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,027
(gentle music)
(fire crackling)

320
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:05,940
(Claire sighs)

321
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,089
Then I woke up.

322
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,900
(gentle music)
(fire crackling)

323
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,980
(footsteps retreating)

324
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,249
- Claire?

325
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:16,882
(gentle music)

326
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,709
(hands thudding)

327
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,342
(gentle music)

328
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:27,594
(Ben sighs)

329
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,503
- You know what?

330
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:30,336
This is what we need.

331
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:31,169
Yeah.

332
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:32,914
Yeah this will definitely break the ice.

333
00:14:32,964 --> 00:14:34,310
(liquid sloshing)

334
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,210
What are you waiting for
with that God damn thing?

335
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,640
- Just, don't push your
selfishness on me.

336
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,390
You know exactly what this is.

337
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,383
- I don't.

338
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,332
- I bought this on the day
we got married 10 years ago.

339
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:48,380
(Claire sighs)

340
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,990
We waited this long and we
can at lest wait until we're

341
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,892
not at each others throats to open it.

342
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:56,230
- Yeah well in that case
we'll never fucking open it.

343
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,063
- You know you really are

344
00:14:57,113 --> 00:15:00,031
an intolerable...
- You're an asshole.

345
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:02,763
(Ben sighs)

346
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:04,635
(gentle music)

347
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:07,590
(footsteps retreating)

348
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,223
(gentle music)

349
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,760
(Claire sighs)
(gentle music)

350
00:15:20,232 --> 00:15:22,640
(Claire sniffles)

351
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,433
- Can I do something with your hair?

352
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,360
- Sure.

353
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,459
(Claire and Lucy laughing)

354
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,806
(gentle music)

355
00:15:30,856 --> 00:15:31,970
(Claire sighs)

356
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,389
What a day (laughs).

357
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:35,450
(Claire sniffles)

358
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,880
I wanted to apologize for earlier.

359
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,763
I,

360
00:15:39,974 --> 00:15:43,342
I don't really have an
excuse I'm just sorry.

361
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:44,957
- It's totally fine (laughs).

362
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,580
Man you two can really go at it.

363
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:49,933
- Yeah we can.

364
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,483
(Lucy laughs)

365
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:56,174
(door sliding)

366
00:15:57,537 --> 00:16:00,985
(crickets chirping)

367
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:04,132
- I'm uh, I'm sorry 'bout
what happened in there.

368
00:16:04,182 --> 00:16:06,100
(crickets chirping)

369
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,273
Claire and I uh,

370
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,163
our marriage isn't in
the best place right now.

371
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,990
It's been hard since the um...

372
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,254
- But can you?

373
00:16:18,304 --> 00:16:20,887
(gentle music)

374
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,610
- My doctor said that I can.

375
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:28,563
Uh, we just haven't tried since.

376
00:16:29,465 --> 00:16:32,819
It's a little scary to want
to try after that happens.

377
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:33,702
You know?

378
00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:36,519
- [Lucy] Yeah.

379
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:39,152
(gentle music)

380
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,353
- What?

381
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,548
- I think you two are
gonna make it work.

382
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:49,135
(gentle music)

383
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:50,207
(crickets chirping)

384
00:16:50,257 --> 00:16:51,994
- We used to not be that way.

385
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,810
(crickets chirping)

386
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,860
Used to laugh a lot.

387
00:16:58,911 --> 00:17:00,175
We used to uh...

388
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:02,851
(crickets chirping)

389
00:17:02,901 --> 00:17:04,640
(Ben sighs)

390
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,750
Maybe we'll get past it, maybe we won't.

391
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,800
(crickets chirping)
(gentle music)

392
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,290
- You know that there's this beetle

393
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,863
in the Amazon that once it uh mates,

394
00:17:16,813 --> 00:17:20,820
its entire genetic makeup
changes for the rest of its life?

395
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,703
- Hm.

396
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,810
- It carries the genes
of its partner forever.

397
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,236
Isn't that crazy?

398
00:17:28,286 --> 00:17:29,069
- Yeah, that's pretty far out.

399
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,766
- Yeah, I love that idea.

400
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,010
(crickets chirping)

401
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,893
Yeah.

402
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,360
Once I started dating
Lucy, everything changed.

403
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,817
- You and Tyler, what about you guys?

404
00:17:41,867 --> 00:17:43,563
You seem like a good fit.

405
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,280
- He's um, he's a gentlemen.

406
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,903
Just, not in the way most guys are.

407
00:17:52,236 --> 00:17:53,233
- [Claire] What do you mean?

408
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,943
- He's nothing but nice to me but,

409
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,240
well a couple weeks ago...

410
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,073
- [Claire] Yeah?

411
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:03,174
- We were at a bar.

412
00:18:03,224 --> 00:18:04,007
- [Claire] Mm hm.

413
00:18:04,057 --> 00:18:05,960
- And this guy bumps into me.

414
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,563
Makes me spill my drink.

415
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,549
It was an accident so.

416
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:15,490
This guy was just drunk and rude and,

417
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,616
and he told me to fuck off.

418
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,449
(Claire scoffs)

419
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:20,030
- Jerk.

420
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,703
- Things escalated.

421
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,879
Tyler this whole time
was in the bathroom,

422
00:18:25,929 --> 00:18:28,210
and when he comes back the guy's gone.

423
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,763
He went back to his friends.

424
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,470
But the rest of the night I could

425
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,943
just see that Tyler
was, watching this guy.

426
00:18:38,548 --> 00:18:41,390
And then he comes to me and says,

427
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,120
meet me outside, we're leaving.

428
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,760
I go outside.

429
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:48,640
Waiting on the sidewalk
and the guy comes outside.

430
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:50,955
And right in the doorway.

431
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:53,505
(tense music)

432
00:18:55,068 --> 00:18:57,769
- What the fuck dude?
(horn honking)

433
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:01,154
(chair legs clattering)
(dramatic music)

434
00:19:01,204 --> 00:19:02,069
(man groans)

435
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:04,046
(tense music)

436
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:06,073
(car whizzing)

437
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:09,456
(footsteps approaching)

438
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:19,826
(gentle music)

439
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:44,782
- Jesus.

440
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:49,284
- [Lucy] I knew right then.

441
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:50,641
- That he was crazy?

442
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,640
(tense music)

443
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,020
- No, that he was never gonna

444
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,280
let anybody hurt me every again.

445
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,830
(tense music)

446
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,930
- Yeah.

447
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,763
Thought you said it was an accident?

448
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:07,954
- That was the night I knew I loved him.

449
00:20:08,004 --> 00:20:10,587
(gentle music)

450
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,989
- You know I, I never did ask you

451
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:16,260
what brought you two out here?

452
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,150
- We came out here to see somebody.

453
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,030
- [Claire] Oh?

454
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,297
Friend or family?

455
00:20:20,347 --> 00:20:21,130
- Um, done.

456
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,830
There you go.

457
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,663
- Oh.

458
00:20:23,713 --> 00:20:25,900
It's great, thank you.

459
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,816
- [Lucy] Do you have anything to eat?

460
00:20:27,866 --> 00:20:29,563
- I was gonna make some soup.

461
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,673
- Okay.

462
00:20:31,723 --> 00:20:33,396
I'm gonna go freshen up real quick.

463
00:20:33,446 --> 00:20:34,279
- Okay.

464
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:38,537
(footsteps retreating)

465
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,313
- Me and Lucy we never um,

466
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,725
we've never had sex.

467
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:50,270
(crickets chirping)

468
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,280
I know it's strange right?

469
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,113
You can say it.

470
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:52,996
I know what you're thinkin'.

471
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,290
(Tyler smirks)

472
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,233
It's unusual.

473
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,800
But it was obvious at
first she didn't want to.

474
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,413
And I was fine with that.

475
00:21:02,463 --> 00:21:03,246
I...

476
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:06,440
(crickets chirping)

477
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,291
She told me she was raped.

478
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:11,611
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

479
00:21:11,661 --> 00:21:15,441
It was like my whole body was
electrocuted with rage man.

480
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:19,590
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

481
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,880
Lucy, she's not the kinda girl

482
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,090
that's gonna sleep with somebody easy.

483
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,841
She needs to really like
them to really trust them,

484
00:21:24,891 --> 00:21:26,815
and they hadn't slept
with each other yet.

485
00:21:26,865 --> 00:21:30,570
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

486
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,916
Then one day she decided
to go up to his hotel room.

487
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:35,580
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

488
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,463
She liked him.

489
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,860
She trusted him.

490
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,693
They were dating.

491
00:21:40,743 --> 00:21:43,374
It was long distance but
she decided to go up there.

492
00:21:43,424 --> 00:21:48,424
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

493
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,124
Right away she knew something was wrong.

494
00:21:50,174 --> 00:21:52,070
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

495
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,200
So she tried to leave
but he wouldn't let her.

496
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:59,250
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

497
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:11,750
- Did she tell the police?

498
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,990
- She was in shock.

499
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,873
She...

500
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,830
In some twisted fucking way
she thought it was her fault.

501
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,093
- Jesus.

502
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,960
Tyler, she needs to tell the police.

503
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,688
- The guy's fuckin' scum right?

504
00:22:27,738 --> 00:22:29,100
- Yeah fuckin' A.

505
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,344
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

506
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,165
- She told me his name.

507
00:22:34,215 --> 00:22:37,630
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

508
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,930
Nowadays you can find just about

509
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,170
anybody if you really want to.

510
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:46,220
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

511
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,310
Found out where he lives.

512
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,453
Where he works.

513
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,091
What kind of car he drives.

514
00:22:55,141 --> 00:23:00,141
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

515
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,613
You know Ben, he doesn't
live very far from here.

516
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:07,910
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

517
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,092
You asked earlier what
we were doin' out here.

518
00:23:10,142 --> 00:23:13,070
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

519
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,160
- Wait.

520
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,043
Wait, wait.

521
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,704
What, what are you sayin'
to me right now?

522
00:23:19,754 --> 00:23:22,579
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

523
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:25,469
- I'm sayin' Ben, a guy that does

524
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:27,823
somethin' like that to a woman,

525
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,180
he knows where he's goin'.

526
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,617
I just sent him there a little sooner.

527
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:39,246
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

528
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:41,713
(Ben laughs)

529
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,793
- Yeah (laughs).

530
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,077
Oh that, that's, that's good (laughs).

531
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:55,283
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

532
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:56,242
You killed him?

533
00:23:56,292 --> 00:24:01,292
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

534
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,638
- Yeah I killed him.

535
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:07,688
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

536
00:24:09,572 --> 00:24:10,355
Ben I...

537
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:11,370
(door sliding)

538
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,780
- Oh, it's freezing out here.

539
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:14,613
- [Tyler] Come here.

540
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,705
(crickets chirping)

541
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:17,672
Warm me up.

542
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,073
- Oh, guess what?

543
00:24:20,123 --> 00:24:20,906
- Hm?

544
00:24:20,956 --> 00:24:21,869
- Claire's gonna make some soup.

545
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,215
- Oh that sounds really good.

546
00:24:23,265 --> 00:24:25,890
- [Lucy] Yeah.

547
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,723
- [Ben] Yeah?

548
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:28,351
(crickets chirping)

549
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:29,184
- You okay?

550
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,760
(hand patting)

551
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:32,593
- Yeah.

552
00:24:32,643 --> 00:24:35,903
(crickets chirping)

553
00:24:35,953 --> 00:24:37,167
I'll, I'll be back.

554
00:24:37,217 --> 00:24:40,023
(crickets chirping)

555
00:24:40,073 --> 00:24:41,995
(Lucy laughs)

556
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:43,610
- They're beautiful aren't they?

557
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,443
- Yeah.

558
00:24:44,493 --> 00:24:47,380
(footsteps approaching)

559
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,213
- I need to talk to you.

560
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:49,046
- Not now.

561
00:24:49,096 --> 00:24:49,879
- Yes now.

562
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:50,970
Right fucking now.

563
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,430
- Do you guys need any help?

564
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,290
- No, we're fine.

565
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,480
Thank you so much.

566
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,300
- We're just gonna put our
feet up for a little bit.

567
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,133
- Yeah sure.

568
00:24:57,183 --> 00:24:59,720
Um, you can actually take the
room at the end over there.

569
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,553
- Okay.

570
00:25:00,603 --> 00:25:01,436
- Yep.

571
00:25:05,198 --> 00:25:06,124
(Claire sighs)

572
00:25:06,174 --> 00:25:07,670
(tense music)

573
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,152
You never fought for me.

574
00:25:09,202 --> 00:25:10,889
(tense music)

575
00:25:10,939 --> 00:25:12,330
- What?

576
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,223
- The concert.

577
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:17,870
That guy that elbowed you in the face?

578
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,703
- By accident.

579
00:25:18,753 --> 00:25:20,190
- Okay maybe the first
time it was an accident

580
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,003
but he did it again and what did I do?

581
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,133
I told him to fuck off.

582
00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:27,823
And then he pushed me.

583
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,659
He pushed me.

584
00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:32,002
(lid clattering)

585
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:33,052
And what did you do?

586
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,520
Nothing (hands thudding).

587
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,403
We just walked away.

588
00:25:38,576 --> 00:25:40,380
Why didn't you do something?

589
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,210
(crickets chirping)

590
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,093
Why?

591
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,973
- Okay I'm sorry.

592
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,673
I am.

593
00:25:50,697 --> 00:25:53,453
If I could go back, I would.

594
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:56,730
(Ben sighs)

595
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,777
I don't know what I would do to him.

596
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,210
Alright?

597
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,093
But,

598
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:05,930
(sighs)

599
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,223
but I won't let anyone
hurt you ever again, okay?

600
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,800
(gentle music)

601
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,730
Tyler...

602
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,183
- What?

603
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:20,655
(tense music)

604
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,214
- He killed someone.

605
00:26:24,264 --> 00:26:25,047
- What?

606
00:26:25,097 --> 00:26:26,390
(tense music)

607
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,680
- They came out here to find this guy.

608
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:30,513
- What guy?

609
00:26:30,563 --> 00:26:31,940
What are you talking about?

610
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,080
- Lucy told Tyler about this guy

611
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,407
that she was seeing before Tyler and,

612
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:38,937
and that he raped her.

613
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:41,180
(tense music)

614
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:45,350
So, Tyler found the guy
and he lives out here.

615
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,357
They drove out here, found
him and he killed him.

616
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:52,830
- Okay, this, this guy raped Lucy?

617
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,430
- Yeah, that's what Tyler said.

618
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,550
- Well fuck him then.

619
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,383
- What?

620
00:26:57,433 --> 00:26:59,130
- [Claire] If this guy raped her then...

621
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,290
- He deserves to die?

622
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,810
Is that what you're saying?

623
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,460
- Yeah that's exactly
what I'm saying actually.

624
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:08,320
- You don't know what you're
saying because you're drunk.

625
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:11,343
- I'm not drunk and I
do know what I'm saying.

626
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,008
- Put your emotions aside for

627
00:27:14,058 --> 00:27:16,580
a minute and let me tell you somethin'.

628
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:17,576
We're accessories.

629
00:27:17,626 --> 00:27:20,080
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

630
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,570
We have knowledge of a crime,

631
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,810
and if we don't share our
knowledge with the police,

632
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,063
then we're essentially
helping the criminal.

633
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,762
Meaning jail.

634
00:27:30,812 --> 00:27:35,450
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

635
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,470
We can take 'em in.

636
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,400
(tense music)

637
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,582
We can do this together, you and me!

638
00:27:40,632 --> 00:27:45,343
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

639
00:27:45,393 --> 00:27:46,176
(Claire sighs)

640
00:27:46,226 --> 00:27:49,810
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

641
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,303
- You've lost your mind, you know that?

642
00:27:53,603 --> 00:27:54,436
- Maybe.

643
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,353
But it feels pretty damn good.

644
00:27:57,403 --> 00:28:00,420
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

645
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,250
We deliver him and Lucy to the police.

646
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,379
We just bring 'em right
in to the station.

647
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:08,955
(crickets chirping)

648
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:10,082
- No.

649
00:28:10,132 --> 00:28:13,190
No but, we, we, we need
to get out of here.

650
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,630
We, we should just go.
- Mm hm.

651
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,463
- Let's go right now.

652
00:28:15,513 --> 00:28:16,296
We'll go to the police sta...

653
00:28:16,346 --> 00:28:19,293
- If we do that, they'll
know where we're going,

654
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:21,188
and they'll run.

655
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:24,828
I mean think about it.

656
00:28:24,878 --> 00:28:26,672
We don't know if they have a gun.

657
00:28:26,722 --> 00:28:29,130
(crickets chirping)

658
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,190
We don't know how we'll
react if he's cornered.

659
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,790
We don't want unpredictable.

660
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,143
We don't want panic.

661
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:41,433
What we want is calm and
relaxed and fun and games.

662
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,856
- [Claire] Fun and games?

663
00:28:44,906 --> 00:28:46,290
- [Ben] Until...

664
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:49,748
- [Claire] Until what?

665
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:54,798
(gentle music)
(ball rolling)

666
00:29:06,409 --> 00:29:09,713
- What's been goin' on
between us has been difficult.

667
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,690
- That's an understatement.

668
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,070
- Yeah it's been a
fuckin' nightmare lately.

669
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,713
- Yep, that's more like it.

670
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:25,530
- And hurtful and, and mean and...

671
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,827
Maybe our time's run out.

672
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,023
Maybe,

673
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,180
I don't want to say it but,

674
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,483
maybe seperating's the
best thing for us.

675
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,710
I don't know.

676
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:46,149
(Ben sighs)

677
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:50,103
But you told me that we needed
to get on the same page.

678
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:51,930
And you're right.

679
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,733
We do.

680
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,663
So do this with me.

681
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,933
We can do this but only
if we do it together.

682
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:05,297
(Claire sighs)

683
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:07,060
(tense music)

684
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,210
- You really (laughs),

685
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,813
you really think we can do this?

686
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,050
- [Ben] Yeah.

687
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,645
I really do.

688
00:30:14,695 --> 00:30:19,695
(gentle music)
(crickets chirping)

689
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,244
- This looks incredible.

690
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,196
- [Lucy] Yeah.

691
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:32,640
- The generosity you
two have given us has...

692
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,800
- It's our pleasure.

693
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,933
We're just glad we could help.

694
00:30:35,983 --> 00:30:38,983
(crickets chirping)

695
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,110
- Speaking of that uh,

696
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:45,060
we've been talking it over
and we don't wanna impose

697
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,270
on you any further and
it's really no problem.

698
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,098
We could find a hotel or...
- No.

699
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:54,148
- What Claire means is all
the hotels, they're closed.

700
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,093
- Closed?

701
00:30:55,143 --> 00:30:57,130
(crickets chirping)

702
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,940
- Yeah it's, it's getting
late and you know,

703
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,550
drivin' down that wind-y road,

704
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,242
it's hard enough in broad daylight.

705
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:04,990
(crickets chirping)

706
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,823
No.

707
00:31:05,873 --> 00:31:07,647
We have plenty of room, right?

708
00:31:07,697 --> 00:31:08,480
- You sure?

709
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,601
- Yeah, uh huh, of course.
- Yeah, course.

710
00:31:09,651 --> 00:31:10,434
- And...

711
00:31:10,484 --> 00:31:12,510
(Claire and Ben laughing)

712
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,510
- And you know I think
tonight is as good a night

713
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,480
as any to open my bottle,
and we would love to share.

714
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,450
- No, we couldn't.

715
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,963
- No it's, it's perfect.

716
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,190
The arrival of you two has just,

717
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,223
it's given Claire and I some new ideas.

718
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:32,170
So, let's enjoy this dinner.

719
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,425
We'll get a good nights sleep and,

720
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,290
tomorrow we'll take you into town.

721
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,271
I insist.

722
00:31:36,321 --> 00:31:39,810
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

723
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,006
- If you insist.

724
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,178
(tense music)

725
00:31:43,228 --> 00:31:46,520
(crickets chirping)

726
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:47,403
- Good.

727
00:31:49,528 --> 00:31:51,962
(Claire sniffs)

728
00:31:52,012 --> 00:31:57,012
(cutlery clattering)
(tense music)

729
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,163
Tyler's a fisherman.

730
00:32:02,326 --> 00:32:03,250
- Hm.

731
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,510
Well that's, interesting work.

732
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,120
- It's hard work.

733
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,143
It's cold, cramped.

734
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,286
Food's nothin' like this.

735
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:11,806
(Claire laughs)

736
00:32:11,856 --> 00:32:13,098
Hm.

737
00:32:13,148 --> 00:32:15,340
- Ever since my folks died I just...

738
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,028
- Aw, I'm sorry.

739
00:32:17,078 --> 00:32:19,820
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

740
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,838
- Thank you.

741
00:32:20,888 --> 00:32:21,976
It's been a long time now.

742
00:32:22,026 --> 00:32:24,526
(tense music)

743
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:27,820
I was talking to Ben about this earlier.

744
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,140
My dad died the year I was born

745
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,840
and my mother died when I was 15.

746
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,090
I think I travel and do so much runnin'

747
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,853
around to try to avoid bein' lonely.

748
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,260
And hope that maybe
by accident I'll just

749
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,410
happen to stumble on
the right tracks and,

750
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,690
be in a nice place
surrounded by good people.

751
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,560
- Hm.

752
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:49,853
Yeah, I know what you mean.

753
00:32:50,848 --> 00:32:53,910
Sometimes you just gotta
keep moving so you can,

754
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,330
avoid that idle time where
you start to think things

755
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,540
which can easily lead
to getting depressed.

756
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,920
- And it always does doesn't it?

757
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:01,803
- Yeah.

758
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:05,372
You have a really good attitude though.

759
00:33:05,422 --> 00:33:07,576
Leave things up to destiny, you know?

760
00:33:07,626 --> 00:33:10,126
(tense music)

761
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,650
- I don't believe in destiny (laughs).

762
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:16,859
- Me neither.

763
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,500
But I am glad that we are here

764
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:24,450
and that we got picked up by
people as nice as yourselves.

765
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,307
To our kind warm hearted
strangers (laughs).

766
00:33:30,184 --> 00:33:30,967
(Claire sighs)

767
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:32,308
- Cheers to that.
- Cheers.

768
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:33,293
(Claire and Lucy laughing)

769
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:34,126
- [Ben] Nice.

770
00:33:34,176 --> 00:33:34,959
Cheers.

771
00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:37,926
(glasses clinking)

772
00:33:40,391 --> 00:33:43,141
(fire crackling)

773
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,650
- That's why when you take the paper,

774
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,312
(paper crinkling)

775
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:50,612
and twist it...

776
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,599
(footsteps receding)

777
00:33:54,649 --> 00:33:56,767
(crickets chirping)

778
00:33:56,817 --> 00:33:59,823
(paper crinkling)

779
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:02,456
(fire roaring)

780
00:34:04,569 --> 00:34:05,352
(crickets chirping)

781
00:34:05,402 --> 00:34:08,483
(Tyler sniffs)

782
00:34:08,533 --> 00:34:10,087
(Tyler sighs)

783
00:34:10,137 --> 00:34:14,223
(crickets chirping)
(fire crackling)

784
00:34:14,273 --> 00:34:16,856
(Tyler grunts)

785
00:34:18,406 --> 00:34:21,239
(water splashing)

786
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:24,840
(Tyler sighs)

787
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:25,723
- Oh, um.

788
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,510
(Claire laughs)

789
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,151
(gentle music)

790
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:33,609
(Claire laughs)

791
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:35,723
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

792
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:36,556
(tense music)
(footsteps approaching)

793
00:34:36,606 --> 00:34:38,915
(hand patting)

794
00:34:38,965 --> 00:34:43,965
(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

795
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:50,382
(hand patting)

796
00:34:50,432 --> 00:34:55,432
(footsteps retreating)
(tense music)

797
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,466
- [Ben] What the hell was that?

798
00:34:57,516 --> 00:34:58,299
- What?

799
00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:01,689
(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

800
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:02,522
- Claire?

801
00:35:02,572 --> 00:35:04,364
(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

802
00:35:04,414 --> 00:35:06,320
- Why didn't you tell me
that he lost his parents?

803
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,603
- Would it matter?

804
00:35:07,653 --> 00:35:11,730
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

805
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,410
In case you forgot he killed someone.

806
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,293
- How?

807
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,354
How did he do it?

808
00:35:17,404 --> 00:35:18,190
Did he say?

809
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,240
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

810
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,720
- You don't think he did it do you?

811
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,324
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

812
00:35:28,374 --> 00:35:29,950
- I don't know.

813
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,398
And neither do you by the way.

814
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:39,448
(gentle music)
(crickets chirping)

815
00:35:44,594 --> 00:35:45,872
(Tyler sighs)

816
00:35:45,922 --> 00:35:50,922
(gentle music)
(crickets chirping)

817
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,688
Hey?

818
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:04,728
Come here.

819
00:36:04,778 --> 00:36:08,111
(footsteps approaching)

820
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:11,420
Do you really think that we can do this?

821
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:12,420
- Yes, God damn it.

822
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,772
- Okay.

823
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:17,155
- [Ben] Alright?

824
00:36:18,305 --> 00:36:20,204
- Here's what I think we should do.

825
00:36:20,254 --> 00:36:23,254
(Claire whispering)

826
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,980
(tense music)

827
00:36:53,614 --> 00:36:54,814
- [Ben] Are you with me?

828
00:36:56,643 --> 00:36:57,976
- [Claire] Yeah.

829
00:36:59,946 --> 00:37:02,191
(glasses thudding)

830
00:37:02,241 --> 00:37:03,024
(cork popping)

831
00:37:03,074 --> 00:37:04,420
- I guess this is where I'm supposed

832
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,617
to say something profound and witty.

833
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:08,320
(liquid pouring)

834
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,865
I guess this is where
I tell you the truth.

835
00:37:11,915 --> 00:37:14,530
(liquid pouring)

836
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,310
These last 10 years,

837
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,000
there have been days that I thought,

838
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,063
maybe we'd made a mistake,

839
00:37:20,961 --> 00:37:24,272
and that we'd be happier
with someone else.

840
00:37:24,322 --> 00:37:27,220
(gentle music)

841
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:32,083
Most days, most days I love
you more than you'll ever know.

842
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,883
Days where I can't imagine
livin' without you.

843
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:39,907
(Ben sighs)

844
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,140
Can we listen to each other and talk

845
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,323
to each other like
civilized human beings?

846
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:46,525
Could we...

847
00:37:46,575 --> 00:37:48,698
- Can we make a baby?

848
00:37:48,748 --> 00:37:52,152
(crickets chirping)

849
00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:53,462
- Yeah.

850
00:37:53,512 --> 00:37:54,886
Yeah we, we can make a baby.

851
00:37:54,936 --> 00:37:57,519
(Ben chuckles)

852
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:00,527
Yeah (laughs).

853
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:06,677
(glass thuds)

854
00:38:06,727 --> 00:38:07,934
Okay, go ahead.

855
00:38:07,984 --> 00:38:08,780
(hand slaps)

856
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,713
- Fuck you.

857
00:38:09,763 --> 00:38:11,019
(Ben sighs)

858
00:38:11,069 --> 00:38:13,900
(footsteps retreating)

859
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,761
- Wait.

860
00:38:14,811 --> 00:38:16,963
(footsteps retreating)

861
00:38:17,013 --> 00:38:19,243
(footsteps approaching)

862
00:38:19,293 --> 00:38:20,418
- Are you okay?

863
00:38:20,468 --> 00:38:21,295
- Yeah.

864
00:38:21,345 --> 00:38:22,338
I'll live.

865
00:38:22,388 --> 00:38:23,894
(Lucy laughs)

866
00:38:23,944 --> 00:38:26,670
(liquid pouring)

867
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,417
(glass thuds)

868
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:29,289
Alright.

869
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:31,433
For you and for her.

870
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:36,760
- This is, probably not the
way you pictured enjoying this.

871
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,860
- Yeah, you're right
about that (laughs).

872
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:42,318
(Ben chuckles)

873
00:38:43,703 --> 00:38:46,953
(footsteps retreating)

874
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:52,296
(glass thudding)
(tense music)

875
00:38:52,346 --> 00:38:53,427
(liquid pouring)

876
00:38:53,477 --> 00:38:54,288
(glasses thudding)

877
00:38:54,338 --> 00:38:59,338
(tense music)
(paper rustling)

878
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:06,102
(liquid pouring)

879
00:39:06,152 --> 00:39:08,950
(tense music)

880
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,315
- [Tyler] That wouldn't happen
to be for me now would it?

881
00:39:12,365 --> 00:39:14,865
(tense music)

882
00:39:18,495 --> 00:39:19,954
(ice cubes clinking)

883
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:22,504
(tense music)

884
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:24,956
- Damn.

885
00:39:25,006 --> 00:39:27,580
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

886
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,424
- Yeah.

887
00:39:28,474 --> 00:39:29,550
(Ben sniffs)

888
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,070
Come on, let's go downstairs.

889
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,903
There's a pool table.

890
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:32,987
(hand patting)

891
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,537
(tense music)

892
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,023
How 'bout another one?

893
00:39:44,724 --> 00:39:45,994
(bottle thuds)

894
00:39:46,044 --> 00:39:49,044
(crickets chirping)

895
00:39:51,628 --> 00:39:52,525
(Tyler sighs)

896
00:39:52,575 --> 00:39:55,337
(crickets chirping)

897
00:39:55,387 --> 00:39:57,126
(balls breaking)

898
00:39:57,176 --> 00:39:59,330
(Claire sighs)

899
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,430
- Sounds like they're
havin' a good time.

900
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,045
Do you wanna talk about it?

901
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:10,176
- Not really (laughs).

902
00:40:10,226 --> 00:40:13,226
(crickets chirping)

903
00:40:18,606 --> 00:40:19,389
Do you want to tell me why you

904
00:40:19,439 --> 00:40:22,593
and Tyler really came
out here this weekend?

905
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:25,777
- What do you mean?

906
00:40:25,827 --> 00:40:28,413
- I mean we've been more
than generous and helpful.

907
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,390
The ride, the dinner.

908
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,962
Now you're drinking 35 year old scotch.

909
00:40:34,012 --> 00:40:37,670
(crickets chirping)

910
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,658
Least you can do is not lie to me.

911
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:40,945
(crickets chirping)

912
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:41,954
(bed creaks)

913
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:45,004
(crickets chirping)

914
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,163
- It wasn't my idea to come here.

915
00:40:51,469 --> 00:40:52,600
(bed creaking)

916
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,800
But isn't that the way
life goes sometimes?

917
00:40:55,850 --> 00:41:00,030
Taking you to places you
thought you'd never go,

918
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,009
and to places you can never forget.

919
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:04,990
(crickets chirping)

920
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,040
Tyler, Tyler came out
of nowhere for me and,

921
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,059
he came at a time when
I really needed help.

922
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:13,892
(ball bangs)

923
00:41:13,942 --> 00:41:16,442
(tense music)

924
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,530
- I can only assume that you

925
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,230
told your wife so now she knows.

926
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,780
No, not probably.

927
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:27,453
I definitely shouldn't have
told you that Ben but I did.

928
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:31,273
But I guess what I'm
getting at right now

929
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:34,686
is that I really painted
myself in a corner here.

930
00:41:34,736 --> 00:41:37,906
(tense music)

931
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:38,786
(Tyler sighs)

932
00:41:38,836 --> 00:41:39,619
(tense music)

933
00:41:39,669 --> 00:41:41,751
So what I'm tryin' to say is you know,

934
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:44,820
(tense music)

935
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,600
I probably shouldn't have done that.

936
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:49,777
(tense music)

937
00:41:49,827 --> 00:41:51,350
(glass thuds)

938
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,500
- I was uh, seeing somebody
before Tyler.

939
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,123
Someone in secret.

940
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,478
He was older than me.

941
00:42:00,528 --> 00:42:03,540
You know he could come
to town on business two,

942
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,813
three times a month.

943
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,432
We saw each other pretty regularly.

944
00:42:09,482 --> 00:42:11,450
(crickets chirping)

945
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,433
I liked him.

946
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:14,993
He was funny.

947
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,320
And funny's just such a
good quality in a guy.

948
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,800
- Yeah.

949
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:24,678
- We'd go out to dinners and the movies.

950
00:42:24,728 --> 00:42:29,728
But we never slept
together in three months.

951
00:42:29,935 --> 00:42:30,770
- Oh.

952
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,667
- Not that I didn't want to, I did.

953
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:35,700
(crickets chirping)

954
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:40,080
And then one night I go
up to his hotel room,

955
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,772
like I'd done 15 times before.

956
00:42:43,822 --> 00:42:47,190
(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

957
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,720
He'd been drinking, which
he'd never done around me.

958
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:54,010
You know I, I never saw him like that.

959
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,784
I mean he'd get soda when
we'd go out to dinner.

960
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:59,910
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

961
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,233
He told me he liked me.

962
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,211
I told him I liked him.

963
00:43:05,261 --> 00:43:08,100
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

964
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:13,100
He wanted to have sex, and I didn't.

965
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:15,930
You know not, not like that
and not, I told him that.

966
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:20,153
I said, not like this
meaning you're drunk.

967
00:43:21,748 --> 00:43:24,050
He didn't like that very much which,

968
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,503
pissed me off because,

969
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:29,441
you know he wants to
sleep with me and I don't.

970
00:43:29,491 --> 00:43:30,274
You know fuck him.

971
00:43:30,324 --> 00:43:31,823
It takes two you know?

972
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:38,433
So I got up, and as soon as I did,

973
00:43:40,258 --> 00:43:42,963
I could feel the whole room change.

974
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:45,363
The energy.

975
00:43:47,174 --> 00:43:48,963
I can't really describe it but,

976
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,231
I could feel it.

977
00:43:52,281 --> 00:43:55,330
(tense music)

978
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,213
He got up.

979
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,193
Hit me.

980
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:00,953
Hard.

981
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,642
Kinda knocked me out
for a second or two and,

982
00:44:06,692 --> 00:44:09,192
(tense music)

983
00:44:10,604 --> 00:44:12,127
that's all it took.

984
00:44:12,177 --> 00:44:13,417
(tense music)

985
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:18,467
He was on top of me
and then it was over.

986
00:44:19,691 --> 00:44:22,191
(tense music)

987
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:27,226
- [Claire] I'm so sorry.

988
00:44:27,276 --> 00:44:29,776
(tense music)

989
00:44:31,415 --> 00:44:34,460
- There's so many feelings that

990
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:37,146
go through you when
you're violated like that.

991
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:40,170
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

992
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,093
Confusion.

993
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,250
Shame.

994
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,643
And then a deep sadness.

995
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,403
Anger and rage.

996
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,363
I told, I told Tyler all of this and,

997
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:03,187
right away I saw a fire in his eyes.

998
00:45:03,237 --> 00:45:06,180
(tense music)

999
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:07,490
Couple days later...

1000
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:10,040
(tense music)

1001
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:13,941
That's him.

1002
00:45:13,991 --> 00:45:14,909
(door slams)

1003
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:16,905
(tense music)

1004
00:45:16,955 --> 00:45:18,440
(door unlatching)

1005
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:20,417
Wait, what the hell is that?

1006
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,340
- It's just to scare him.

1007
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:23,355
It's not even loaded.

1008
00:45:23,405 --> 00:45:24,542
(tense music)

1009
00:45:24,592 --> 00:45:25,375
(door slams)

1010
00:45:25,425 --> 00:45:27,925
(tense music)

1011
00:45:34,178 --> 00:45:39,178
(bat whacking)
(tense music)

1012
00:45:47,015 --> 00:45:48,069
(shot firing)

1013
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:50,619
(tense music)

1014
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,243
- What was that shot?

1015
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:04,076
What happened?

1016
00:46:04,126 --> 00:46:04,909
(Tyler sniffs)

1017
00:46:04,959 --> 00:46:06,580
You said it wasn't loaded.

1018
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:08,000
What did it hit?

1019
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:08,833
- It didn't hit, it didn't...

1020
00:46:08,883 --> 00:46:09,770
- What did the bullet hit Tyler?

1021
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,070
- It didn't hit anything.

1022
00:46:12,432 --> 00:46:13,670
(Tyler sniffs)

1023
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,068
- What about him?

1024
00:46:15,118 --> 00:46:17,976
(Tyler sniffs)

1025
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:20,029
- He got what he deserved.

1026
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,912
(engine starting)

1027
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,711
(tense music)

1028
00:46:28,761 --> 00:46:30,306
- Hey, are you okay?

1029
00:46:30,356 --> 00:46:35,356
(engine revving)
(tense music)

1030
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,480
Tyler, talk to me.

1031
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,690
(engine revving)
(tense music)

1032
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,716
What's wrong?

1033
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:46,266
(tense music)

1034
00:46:47,828 --> 00:46:48,611
(Lucy scoffs)

1035
00:46:48,661 --> 00:46:51,161
(tense music)

1036
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,065
(tire blows)
(Lucy gasps)

1037
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,160
(tire rattling)

1038
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:00,411
- [Tyler] No, no, no.

1039
00:47:00,461 --> 00:47:01,496
No, no, no.

1040
00:47:01,546 --> 00:47:03,035
- Wait, what the?

1041
00:47:03,085 --> 00:47:05,114
(door unlatching)

1042
00:47:05,164 --> 00:47:06,911
(Tyler sniffs)

1043
00:47:06,961 --> 00:47:08,490
(door slams)

1044
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:13,540
(tense music)
(birds chirping)

1045
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,137
- Yeah, tire blew up.

1046
00:47:17,187 --> 00:47:19,300
(tense music)
(birds singing)

1047
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:20,209
No spare.

1048
00:47:20,259 --> 00:47:23,876
(tense music)
(birds singing)

1049
00:47:23,926 --> 00:47:25,127
- [Lucy] What do we do?

1050
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:27,844
(Tyler gasping)

1051
00:47:30,229 --> 00:47:31,470
(tense music)

1052
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,303
- We gotta go.

1053
00:47:32,353 --> 00:47:33,350
We gotta, we gotta walk.

1054
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,883
(Tyler sniffs)

1055
00:47:34,933 --> 00:47:35,716
Come on.

1056
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:37,710
(tense music)

1057
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,543
Yeah.

1058
00:47:38,593 --> 00:47:39,376
(door slams)

1059
00:47:39,426 --> 00:47:40,209
Come on.

1060
00:47:40,259 --> 00:47:42,029
(tense music)

1061
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,877
Let's go.

1062
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:47,927
(tense music)
(birds chirping)

1063
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:08,571
(branches rustling)

1064
00:48:08,621 --> 00:48:11,067
(tense music)

1065
00:48:11,117 --> 00:48:12,967
(gravel crunching)

1066
00:48:13,017 --> 00:48:14,031
- [Claire] Hey are you guys okay?

1067
00:48:14,081 --> 00:48:15,650
Do you need a ride or somethin'?

1068
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,872
- Um, yeah that'd be great actually.

1069
00:48:17,922 --> 00:48:19,221
- [Claire] Come on in, yeah.

1070
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,416
I can take you into town.

1071
00:48:20,466 --> 00:48:23,299
(door unlatching)

1072
00:48:24,204 --> 00:48:25,233
(door slams)

1073
00:48:25,283 --> 00:48:26,066
- [Lucy] Thank you.

1074
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:26,899
- [Claire] Yeah, no problem.

1075
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:27,732
(door slams)

1076
00:48:27,782 --> 00:48:32,782
(engine revving)
(tense music)

1077
00:48:36,387 --> 00:48:39,717
(crickets chirping)

1078
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:41,730
- And then you came to our rescue.

1079
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:44,887
(crickets chirping)

1080
00:48:44,937 --> 00:48:45,720
(Tyler exhales)

1081
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:48,270
(tense music)

1082
00:48:51,135 --> 00:48:52,464
- Doin' alright there?

1083
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:55,014
(tense music)

1084
00:48:59,772 --> 00:49:02,530
(Tyler exhaling

1085
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:06,230
You know, what kinda man would I be,

1086
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,280
knowin' that uh I had a murderer

1087
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:13,424
in my house and I just let him go?

1088
00:49:13,474 --> 00:49:15,005
(cue stick clatters)

1089
00:49:15,055 --> 00:49:17,748
(tense music)

1090
00:49:17,798 --> 00:49:19,320
(Tyler grunts)

1091
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,450
How could I look at myself in

1092
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,378
the mirror and not see a coward?

1093
00:49:22,428 --> 00:49:27,428
(Tyler grunts)
(tense music)

1094
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,663
(Tyler thuds)

1095
00:49:33,713 --> 00:49:34,496
(tense music)

1096
00:49:34,546 --> 00:49:35,810
- What was that?

1097
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,447
(ice cubes clinking)

1098
00:49:37,497 --> 00:49:41,010
- Listen, what you went through,
it was, it was terrible.

1099
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:42,246
It was unforgivable okay?

1100
00:49:42,296 --> 00:49:43,857
- Yeah, but I don't even want to,

1101
00:49:43,907 --> 00:49:45,920
I mean I shouldn't have told you.

1102
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:48,377
I just thought that as a
woman you might understand.

1103
00:49:48,427 --> 00:49:50,760
- I do, I do understand okay?

1104
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:52,540
And, and if I were in your shoes

1105
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:54,273
I don't know what I would do but,

1106
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,390
what you're talking
about right now and what,

1107
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,812
what Tyler told Ben...

1108
00:49:58,862 --> 00:49:59,695
- What?

1109
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,950
- Tyler told Ben that he's dead.

1110
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,783
We can't...

1111
00:50:03,833 --> 00:50:05,173
- You knew this whole time?

1112
00:50:05,223 --> 00:50:08,380
- Listen to me, this is very serious.

1113
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:09,213
Okay?

1114
00:50:09,263 --> 00:50:12,560
And I, I know what wanting
revenge feels like.

1115
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,190
I do and I, and I know that
when you're that angry you,

1116
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,050
you wanna rip somebody's eyes out and,

1117
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,060
and you want to hurt them but we can't,

1118
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:20,293
we need your help right now.

1119
00:50:20,343 --> 00:50:21,140
Okay?

1120
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:21,973
I know...

1121
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:22,910
- Let go of me.

1122
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,743
Tyler?

1123
00:50:23,793 --> 00:50:25,300
- Tyler can't hear you right now.

1124
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:26,324
- What do you mean?

1125
00:50:26,374 --> 00:50:28,400
- I get that you might want to kill

1126
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,420
the man that did that to you, okay?

1127
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:33,760
Because you feel that he
deserves it and maybe does but...

1128
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:35,241
- But what?

1129
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:36,347
(tense music)

1130
00:50:36,397 --> 00:50:38,401
(Lucy scoffs)

1131
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:39,234
Tyler?

1132
00:50:39,284 --> 00:50:41,742
(footsteps retreating)

1133
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:42,575
Tyler?

1134
00:50:42,625 --> 00:50:44,057
(Claire sighs)

1135
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:49,107
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1136
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,123
(Claire sighs)

1137
00:51:14,173 --> 00:51:15,701
(footsteps retreating)

1138
00:51:15,751 --> 00:51:16,890
(ties rustling)

1139
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,457
(footsteps approaching)

1140
00:51:18,507 --> 00:51:19,290
(Lucy gasps)

1141
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:24,340
(tense music)
(footsteps approaching)

1142
00:51:26,339 --> 00:51:27,376
(Ben sighs)

1143
00:51:27,426 --> 00:51:32,426
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1144
00:51:32,746 --> 00:51:35,752
(footsteps approaching)

1145
00:51:35,802 --> 00:51:40,802
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1146
00:51:42,236 --> 00:51:44,544
(Lucy sobbing)

1147
00:51:44,594 --> 00:51:47,119
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1148
00:51:47,169 --> 00:51:47,952
- Alright.

1149
00:51:48,002 --> 00:51:49,390
We'll wait 'til the
sun comes up before...

1150
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,025
- [Claire] Before what exactly?

1151
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:52,600
She didn't know.

1152
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:53,433
- What?

1153
00:51:53,483 --> 00:51:55,470
- [Claire] She didn't know
what Tyler was going to do.

1154
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,470
- That's bullshit.

1155
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,509
- No, she's not a part of this.

1156
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,530
- I thought we were so lucky

1157
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,313
when Claire pulled up next to us.

1158
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:05,190
- Lucy, please sit.

1159
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,840
Just, let us explain for a minute.

1160
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,450
(crickets chirping)

1161
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,600
Okay what you went through
was hell, no question.

1162
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:13,448
But you came out on the other
side and there's hope in that.

1163
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:16,053
(crickets chirping)

1164
00:52:16,103 --> 00:52:18,420
- And if you wanna hold on to that hope,

1165
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:19,930
you need to help us.

1166
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:21,573
Which in turn will help you.

1167
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:24,700
- What do you mean?

1168
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:27,290
We need to take Tyler to the police

1169
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,980
and you need to tell them what happened.

1170
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:34,070
That, you told Tyler
what that man did to you

1171
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,630
and that you didn't know what
Tyler was gonna do to him.

1172
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,930
- That's true isn't it?

1173
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:41,370
That you didn't know what
Tyler was going to do?

1174
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,170
Because if he is dead...

1175
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,968
- And if you were a part
of it in any way,

1176
00:52:46,018 --> 00:52:48,603
that makes you an accomplice to a crime.

1177
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,780
- What Ben's talking about is jail.

1178
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:54,171
You don't want to go to jail.

1179
00:52:54,221 --> 00:52:57,250
I don't, we don't want you to go to jail

1180
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,793
for something that Tyler
did on his own accord.

1181
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,340
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1182
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:03,593
- What Tyler did?

1183
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:06,190
Tyler defended me.

1184
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,450
He avenged me.
- No.

1185
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,444
- Yes.

1186
00:53:08,494 --> 00:53:10,300
- [Claire] Okay maybe in a way but...

1187
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:13,788
- [Ben] What Tyler did
was commit murder.

1188
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:18,293
Call it revenge or vengeance
but what it isn't is justified.

1189
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:21,400
- What about the death penalty?

1190
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:22,940
- [Ben] What about the death penalty?

1191
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,794
- The death penalty is justice?

1192
00:53:24,844 --> 00:53:27,240
- [Ben] The death
penalty's used very rarely

1193
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:28,510
in this country and when it is...

1194
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,800
- So what we're talking about

1195
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:32,972
is whether murder is a
justified punishment for rape?

1196
00:53:33,022 --> 00:53:36,199
And you, you obviously
don't think it is.

1197
00:53:36,249 --> 00:53:37,440
(Lucy scoffs)

1198
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:38,813
- No, I don't.

1199
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:41,060
- And the reason you don't is

1200
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:44,088
because you've never experienced it.

1201
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:45,928
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1202
00:53:45,978 --> 00:53:49,460
If you had you'd, you'd have
a different perspective.

1203
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:52,651
- What you're talking
about is vigilante justice.

1204
00:53:52,701 --> 00:53:57,240
Taking the law into your own
hand however you see fit,

1205
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:59,113
that's not the way it works.

1206
00:54:00,590 --> 00:54:03,140
- [Claire] You didn't know
what Tyler was gonna do.

1207
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:04,710
You won't get into any trouble that way.

1208
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,737
- Is that true?

1209
00:54:06,787 --> 00:54:08,620
(tense music)

1210
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:09,503
Lucy?

1211
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,137
- I didn't know what he was gonna do.

1212
00:54:13,187 --> 00:54:14,537
- [Ben] But you were there?

1213
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:17,061
- Yes.

1214
00:54:17,111 --> 00:54:19,376
- Look, I know there's a part of you

1215
00:54:19,426 --> 00:54:22,720
that thinks what he did was heroic,

1216
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,620
but what he did was put your life

1217
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:27,503
and his life on the line.

1218
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:30,437
There's no getting away from this.

1219
00:54:30,487 --> 00:54:32,080
And I think you know that or else

1220
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:33,477
you wouldn't have told Claire.

1221
00:54:33,527 --> 00:54:35,300
(tense music)

1222
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:37,730
That's the feeling of
guilt inside of you.

1223
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,790
(tense music)

1224
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,937
Lucy, this is the right thing to do.

1225
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:45,130
But we need to take control
now before we can't anymore.

1226
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:46,090
Do you understand?

1227
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,020
- [Claire] What we're
asking is are you with us?

1228
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:50,994
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1229
00:54:51,044 --> 00:54:52,344
- I wanna do what's right.

1230
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:54,553
- Good.

1231
00:54:54,603 --> 00:54:56,243
Alright, we need to get Tyler...

1232
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,168
(metal whacks)

1233
00:54:57,218 --> 00:54:58,001
(Ben thuds)

1234
00:54:58,051 --> 00:54:58,834
- [Claire] Ben?

1235
00:54:58,884 --> 00:55:01,384
(tense music)

1236
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,548
(shoe whacks)

1237
00:55:07,598 --> 00:55:10,098
(tense music)

1238
00:55:17,054 --> 00:55:19,151
(crickets chirping)

1239
00:55:19,201 --> 00:55:21,701
(tense music)

1240
00:55:22,834 --> 00:55:24,790
(Ben gasping)

1241
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:25,623
- Claire!

1242
00:55:25,673 --> 00:55:28,052
(Ben gasping)

1243
00:55:28,102 --> 00:55:33,102
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1244
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:37,092
- You look like a badass warrior.

1245
00:55:37,142 --> 00:55:39,631
(crickets chirping)

1246
00:55:39,681 --> 00:55:40,464
Wait.

1247
00:55:40,514 --> 00:55:43,569
(crickets chirping)

1248
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:44,608
(metal clanging)

1249
00:55:44,658 --> 00:55:47,158
(Tyler sighs)

1250
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:49,587
Yeah.

1251
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:51,203
You remember this guy?

1252
00:55:51,253 --> 00:55:53,163
Ah, you probably don't.

1253
00:55:53,213 --> 00:55:54,632
Hold still.

1254
00:55:54,682 --> 00:55:57,265
(metal clunks)

1255
00:55:58,479 --> 00:56:00,896
(Ben groans)

1256
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,593
There.

1257
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,714
You know you were out for awhile.

1258
00:56:07,764 --> 00:56:10,798
(crickets chirping)

1259
00:56:10,848 --> 00:56:13,598
(chair scraping)

1260
00:56:15,718 --> 00:56:18,483
Lucy had to make sure
you will still breathing.

1261
00:56:19,445 --> 00:56:21,120
(Tyler sniffs)

1262
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:22,799
You should be thanking me.

1263
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:24,620
(tense music)

1264
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:26,980
At any moment I coulda tippy
toed into that kitchen,

1265
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:29,955
pulled out a knife and slit your throat.

1266
00:56:30,005 --> 00:56:32,060
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1267
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:33,416
But I didn't do that.

1268
00:56:33,466 --> 00:56:35,110
(crickets chirping)

1269
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,429
- Where's Claire?

1270
00:56:36,479 --> 00:56:37,570
- [Tyler] Claire's fine.

1271
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:40,350
She's downstairs havin' a
little chit chat with Lucy.

1272
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,690
I thought you and I could take

1273
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:45,848
a moment to have a man to man,

1274
00:56:45,898 --> 00:56:47,774
that way we could see eye to eye.

1275
00:56:47,824 --> 00:56:50,510
(tense music)

1276
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,601
That's very important to me Ben.

1277
00:56:52,651 --> 00:56:54,900
(crickets chirping)

1278
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:55,783
- [Ben] What is?

1279
00:56:58,101 --> 00:56:59,503
- That you understand.

1280
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,163
That you empathize with me, man!

1281
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,300
'Cause truth be told I don't want

1282
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:07,460
to have to kill you and your wife.

1283
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:08,941
I really honestly don't,

1284
00:57:08,991 --> 00:57:12,003
but in order for me not
to do that I need to know.

1285
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,110
I need to be convinced.

1286
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,050
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1287
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:16,930
I need to be convinced wholeheartedly

1288
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,643
that you won't go to the police,

1289
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:24,450
or try and be stupid like think
you can overpower me again.

1290
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,000
(tense music)

1291
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:32,940
So, in order for me to
believe that my life

1292
00:57:32,990 --> 00:57:36,430
will continue to go on
and not in a jail cell

1293
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,803
but out here (sniffs) breathin'
the fresh airs of freedom,

1294
00:57:42,732 --> 00:57:45,733
I'm an, I (grunts), I'm an optimist.

1295
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,130
I'm generally a very
positive person Ben.

1296
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,970
What I'm tryin' to say is uh, you and I,

1297
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:58,260
we need to align like the
rails on a railroad track.

1298
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:02,310
Like, like two people
playing the same instrument

1299
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,459
playing the same God damn song.

1300
00:58:04,509 --> 00:58:09,509
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1301
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:11,323
- Okay.

1302
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,280
Okay.

1303
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:15,370
(Tyler sniffs)

1304
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:16,263
- Good.

1305
00:58:16,313 --> 00:58:17,837
(Tyler sniffs)

1306
00:58:17,887 --> 00:58:20,554
(Tyler gasping)

1307
00:58:22,767 --> 00:58:25,368
That's how you tie a knot by the way.

1308
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,350
- Oh.

1309
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,750
You learn that on the boat?

1310
00:58:30,158 --> 00:58:30,991
- Mm hm.

1311
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:33,613
Come to think of it I think

1312
00:58:33,663 --> 00:58:35,903
I used the same knots
on Claire downstairs.

1313
00:58:35,953 --> 00:58:36,840
(tense music)

1314
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:37,908
- Claire!

1315
00:58:37,958 --> 00:58:41,920
(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

1316
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:42,753
- What is this?

1317
00:58:42,803 --> 00:58:43,933
What do you two want?

1318
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:45,693
Just leave.

1319
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:48,120
- We will soon.

1320
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:49,660
But considering our car...

1321
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:50,978
- Just take our car.

1322
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:52,241
(crickets chirping)

1323
00:58:52,291 --> 00:58:55,030
- We talked about that but,

1324
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,698
before we do that we have
a few things to figure out.

1325
00:58:57,748 --> 00:58:58,833
- What do you have to figure out?

1326
00:58:58,883 --> 00:59:01,300
(crickets chirping)

1327
00:59:01,350 --> 00:59:02,933
- What we're gonna do with you two.

1328
00:59:02,983 --> 00:59:03,766
(tense music)

1329
00:59:03,816 --> 00:59:04,599
(Tyler inhales)

1330
00:59:04,649 --> 00:59:06,804
(Tyler exhales)

1331
00:59:06,854 --> 00:59:08,321
(Ben gasps)

1332
00:59:08,371 --> 00:59:09,350
- You know I'm sure you can appreciate

1333
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:11,000
this current situation we're in.

1334
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:17,090
Just a quick refresher, it was
you that tried to poison me.

1335
00:59:17,259 --> 00:59:20,061
(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

1336
00:59:20,111 --> 00:59:21,606
- I was just tryin' to stop you.

1337
00:59:21,656 --> 00:59:24,420
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1338
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:25,288
- From what?

1339
00:59:25,338 --> 00:59:28,100
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1340
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:30,388
- Getting away with what you did.

1341
00:59:30,438 --> 00:59:34,710
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1342
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:39,663
- What I did was try to rid
the world of somethin' evil.

1343
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,339
Ben, you want to punish me for that?

1344
00:59:44,389 --> 00:59:45,840
(crickets chirping)

1345
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:46,793
- Just leave.

1346
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,323
Take our car.

1347
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,159
Just go.

1348
00:59:51,209 --> 00:59:53,770
(crickets chirping)

1349
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:55,023
- That's a great idea.

1350
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,543
We'll take your car and we'll go.

1351
00:59:58,580 --> 00:59:59,690
Yeah.

1352
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,630
And then as soon as we leave you'll trot

1353
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,610
on over to the nearest phone,

1354
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,340
call the police and pretty soon

1355
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:09,360
we'll have choppers on top of
us and cop cars all around us.

1356
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:12,113
That's a fucking stupid idea man.

1357
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:16,960
No, what we're gonna do is you and me

1358
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:19,192
are going to come to an understanding.

1359
01:00:19,242 --> 01:00:21,563
You and me...
- I understand!

1360
01:00:21,613 --> 01:00:25,750
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1361
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,867
I just (sighs), I can never do it.

1362
01:00:31,168 --> 01:00:33,413
(crickets chirping)

1363
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,840
I'm not like you.

1364
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:36,057
I could never,

1365
01:00:37,887 --> 01:00:38,799
I could never do...
- Oh

1366
01:00:38,849 --> 01:00:40,070
Yes you could.

1367
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,342
(Tyler sniffs)

1368
01:00:41,392 --> 01:00:42,175
- No.

1369
01:00:42,225 --> 01:00:43,008
- Yes you could Ben.

1370
01:00:43,058 --> 01:00:43,841
- No.

1371
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:44,674
- Yes you could.

1372
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:45,507
- No.

1373
01:00:45,557 --> 01:00:46,340
- Yes you could Ben.
- No!

1374
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:47,173
I could never kill anyone!

1375
01:00:47,223 --> 01:00:48,100
- You have no idea what kind

1376
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:49,880
of darkness you have inside of you.

1377
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:51,765
Everyone of us has something burning

1378
01:00:51,815 --> 01:00:53,810
inside of us that wants to come out.

1379
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,914
Look at it, it's comin'
out of you right now.

1380
01:00:55,964 --> 01:00:57,820
Don't you feel it?

1381
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:00,150
Don't you feel your fingers squeezing?

1382
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:00,983
Wanting to wrap...

1383
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:01,816
- [Ben] No!

1384
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:04,160
- Wrap themselves around my neck?

1385
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:05,690
Act like you wouldn't right now.

1386
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:06,523
- I'm not you.

1387
01:01:06,573 --> 01:01:07,420
- What do you think you are?

1388
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:08,956
Some kinda saint?

1389
01:01:09,006 --> 01:01:12,190
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1390
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,136
No Ben.

1391
01:01:13,186 --> 01:01:17,120
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1392
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:18,120
- What do you want?

1393
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:25,160
- I want you to admit
that you would do...

1394
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,656
- I'm not admitting anything.

1395
01:01:28,706 --> 01:01:33,040
What you did, you regret it.

1396
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:36,200
You regret what you did
and you feel remorse.

1397
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:41,250
Maybe, maybe you were hopin'
I would console you and,

1398
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:45,533
and tell you Tyler, hey, it's okay man.

1399
01:01:46,379 --> 01:01:47,180
He was a bad guy.

1400
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:48,993
He deserved to die.

1401
01:01:49,966 --> 01:01:52,623
But, that's not what I think.

1402
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,670
What do you want me to say?

1403
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:57,886
I mean what can you say?

1404
01:01:57,936 --> 01:02:02,886
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1405
01:02:02,936 --> 01:02:05,519
(Tyler laughs)

1406
01:02:08,713 --> 01:02:10,180
- I get it (laughs).

1407
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:11,273
I get it Ben.

1408
01:02:12,258 --> 01:02:13,041
I get it.

1409
01:02:13,091 --> 01:02:14,538
Whew!

1410
01:02:14,588 --> 01:02:19,017
This entire time I've been
tryin' to get through to you,

1411
01:02:19,067 --> 01:02:22,301
to get through to you with words.

1412
01:02:22,351 --> 01:02:26,533
Ben, I know why we're failing.

1413
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,033
Words lie.

1414
01:02:29,897 --> 01:02:31,781
Isn't that right?

1415
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:34,331
(tense music)

1416
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,393
- Don't do this.

1417
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:45,713
I, I can see that what's
happening, it's not you.

1418
01:02:47,668 --> 01:02:49,050
But I need your help.

1419
01:02:50,597 --> 01:02:51,380
Okay?

1420
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:52,213
To put an end to this.

1421
01:02:52,263 --> 01:02:53,046
To be reasonable.

1422
01:02:53,096 --> 01:02:53,879
This is...

1423
01:02:53,929 --> 01:02:54,733
- Reason?

1424
01:02:54,783 --> 01:02:57,087
Is that what you're talking about?

1425
01:02:57,137 --> 01:03:00,470
(footsteps approaching)

1426
01:03:01,558 --> 01:03:05,040
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1427
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:10,090
(footsteps approaching)
(tense music)

1428
01:03:14,717 --> 01:03:17,353
There's nothing higher
than reason Claire.

1429
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,847
- Tyler please, stop this.

1430
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:21,730
- Mm.

1431
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,071
Not yet.

1432
01:03:24,121 --> 01:03:27,300
(tense music)

1433
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:28,870
We're close though.

1434
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,940
(tense music)

1435
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:32,729
I need you to come upstairs with me.

1436
01:03:32,779 --> 01:03:35,073
(tense music)

1437
01:03:35,123 --> 01:03:40,123
(footsteps retreating)
(tense music)

1438
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:46,923
(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

1439
01:03:46,973 --> 01:03:47,756
(Ben sighs)

1440
01:03:47,806 --> 01:03:49,955
(tense music)
(crickets chirping)

1441
01:03:50,005 --> 01:03:51,270
(Tyler whistling)

1442
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:52,103
Hey Skip.

1443
01:03:52,153 --> 01:03:54,730
We got a plan, we're
gonna take your car.

1444
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:55,670
- Good.

1445
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:56,503
Just go.

1446
01:03:56,553 --> 01:04:00,050
(crickets chirping)
(tense music)

1447
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:04,271
- Um, you won't call the police on us?

1448
01:04:04,321 --> 01:04:07,300
(crickets chirping)

1449
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:08,133
