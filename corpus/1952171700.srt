00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,723
[ Man ]
Last time, onHercules.
You have made my life complete.

2
00:00:06,723 --> 00:00:09,676
I couldn't have asked
for a greater gift.

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,781
I've no regrets.

4
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:19,869
- I love you, Mother.
-[ Alcmene ] No regrets.

5
00:00:20,887 --> 00:00:23,373
What do you want?
Why are you here now?

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,792
It's time for you to take
your rightful place.

7
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:29,245
By my side. Ruling
the gods of Olympus.

8
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:31,748
We think it could be
the right thing for you,
Hercules.

9
00:00:31,748 --> 00:00:34,734
To go to Olympus.
Yeah.

10
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:38,538
Maybe Zeus was right. People
would be better off with you,

11
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,441
- you know, up there.
- What's your answer?

12
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:43,793
I'm ready to go.

13
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:13,873
You sure you don't want me
to stick around?
I can't ask you to do that.

14
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:18,378
Besides... I've got enough
memories in that house
to keep me company.

15
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,347
I admire your strength, Jason.

16
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:25,235
Alcmene wouldn't
want me to spend the rest
of my life mourning.

17
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:29,689
It'll take time, but
I'll be all right.

18
00:01:32,192 --> 00:01:34,194
Do you know
where you're headed?

19
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,696
Well, I've been thinking about
my mother the past few days.

20
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:38,698
After all that's happened,
I feel like I owe her a visit.

21
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,701
How long has it been?
[ Scoffs ]
Too long.

22
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:45,205
You know, I was such
a troublemaker when I was a kid.

23
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:49,592
Then, as soon as I thought
I was old enough, I just--

She got married again
a couple of years back.

25
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:53,313
To a poet.

I haven't even met him.
[ Chuckles ]

27
00:01:56,316 --> 00:02:00,653
Prodigal son.
I'm sure she misses you.
She'll understand.

28
00:02:05,975 --> 00:02:08,478
Take care of yourself, Jason.
[ Softly ]
You too.

29
00:02:11,347 --> 00:02:14,617
Iolaus?

30
00:02:14,617 --> 00:02:18,471
I know I don't have
to say this.

31
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,473
But it wasn't easy
for Hercules to leave you.

32
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:30,617
[ Booming Thunder ]

00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,119
[ Wind Whistling ]

34
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:36,122
Still having doubts,
aren't you?

35
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,807
Of course I am.

36
00:02:37,807 --> 00:02:40,810
That's because you have
a mortal heart.
[ Chuckles ]

37
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,030
It's never easy to let go
of a life you've built.

38
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,282
The people you care about.

39
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:48,284
You have a new life
to build now.

40
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,254
This is your destiny,
Hercules.

41
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:55,391
Come! Join me on Olympus,
as a god.

42
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:16,713
Welcome home, son.

43
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,206
[ Man Narrating ]
This is the story
of a time long ago,

44
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,408
a time of myth and legend,

45
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,444
when the ancient gods
were petty and cruel,

46
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:34,047
and they plagued mankind
with suffering.

47
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,784
Only one man dared
to challenge their power--

48
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:40,153
Hercules.

49
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:44,123
Hercules possessed a strength
the world had never seen,

50
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,693
a strength surpassed
only by the power of his heart.

51
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:50,296
He journeyed the earth,
battling the minions
of his wicked stepmother, Hera,

52
00:03:50,296 --> 00:03:53,433
the all-powerful
queen of the gods.

53
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,418
But wherever
there was evil,

54
00:03:55,418 --> 00:03:58,905
wherever an innocent
would suffer,

55
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,074
there would be... Hercules.

- [ Screeching ]
- [ Roaring ]

57
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,008
Hail!

58
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:28,067
[ Hercules ]
It's, uh, been a while. I like
what you've done with the place.

59
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,936
[ Zeus ]
Oh, it's not much,
but it's home.

60
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:36,259
All of history
is recorded here:

61
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:40,480
The past, the present,
woven into a tapestry of time.

62
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,484
Look.

Iolaus.

[ Chuckles ]
That was the day we met.

66
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,364
You're a god now.

67
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,367
You can look back on
any part of your life.

68
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,372
What's the matter?

69
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,259
I think I'd rather
keep the past inside.

70
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,363
It means more
to me that way.

71
00:05:13,363 --> 00:05:18,251
Well, then--
try the present.

72
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,243
It's Mother.

73
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:31,497
You see, you don't
have to say good-bye
to those you love.

74
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:34,884
[ Hercules ]
She looks happy.

75
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:38,388
[ Zeus ]
If anyone deserves to be
in the Elysian Fields,

76
00:05:38,388 --> 00:05:40,139
it's Alcmene.

77
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,142
Not a day has gone by...

78
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,144
that I haven't
looked in on her.

79
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,146
You mean, you've watched
her entire life?

80
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:51,034
She's always been...
extraordinary.

[ Hera ]
Oh, is she now? Well--

82
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:57,073
That's what
you do all day, huh?

83
00:05:57,573 --> 00:05:59,575
Sit around and
spy on people?

84
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:01,577
Knowledge is power, Hercules.

85
00:06:01,577 --> 00:06:03,463
What good is power,

86
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,299
if you don't use it
to change things
for the better?

Where are you going?

But you've just got here!
Look, no offense.

89
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,625
But I came up here to try
and make the world
a better place.

90
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,379
I may be a god now, but that
doesn't change who I am.

91
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,798
Believe me, Hercules,

92
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,300
I don't want you to change
who you are.

meet each other finally.

I-I'm sorry I wasn't
at your wedding.

You don't even know
why you came, do you?

without your friend.

They look so insignificant
from up here, don't they?

The only one who looks
insignificant to me,

I didn't come here...
to fight with you, Hercules.

I came to make an offer.

You might even call it
an offer of peace.

for Zeus in common.

nothing in common.

Believe it or not,

00:11:39,248 --> 00:11:42,651
I once loved your father,
and your father loved me--

until something else
caught his eye.

it couldn't compete with

[ Scoffs ]
Oh, please, Hera!

165
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,050
You have never loved
anyone but yourself.

166
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:01,520
You couldn't stand to lose
your power with Zeus. You made
sure the world felt your pain.

167
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,023
I wanted Zeus to understand
what he had done to me.

168

Back? You mean, like,
"back" back?

501
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:31,872
Like, really back?
No more Olympus?
No more, "Hercules, the god"?

502
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:34,625
No, just, uh, half god.
[ Chuckles ]

503
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,461
[ Laughs ]
That's terrific!

504
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:39,246
So, what happened?

505
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,750
I realized how much
my family means to me.

506
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,170
And... you're it.

507
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:56,113
Oh, ah--
Iolaus, wait!

508
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:59,617
Is something wrong?
No! No.

509
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:02,119
I'm just glad you're back.
Ah.

510
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,623
So, uh,
how was Olympus?
Olympus.

511
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:09,126
Uh, not very friendly.
[ Chuckling ]
And, uh, Hera?

512
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:13,130
You could say she's...
history.
