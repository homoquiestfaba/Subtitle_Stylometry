on everything else today.

Yesterday as you know Robert
Mueller made a statement which

26

gave Trump something to get
worked up about.

everyone to stop talking about

Russia, maybe don't start a

beetlejuice or something.

Less than an hour later he

it's a little confusing.

Let me break it down in terms we
can all understand.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,670
Basically, Russia is Lori
loughlin. Trump is her daughter.

56

questions on the subject of

impeachment.
And that didn't make him happy

61

either.

Do you think they're going to
impeach you?

63
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,620
I don't see how.
They can because they're

64

possibly allowed, although I
can't imagine the courts

65
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,930
allowing it.
I've never gotten into it.

be possible, to be using that

villain mode this morning

screaming over the sound of a

"Rambo: First blood 2."

innocent.

crime.

mccain" from his view when he

was in Japan last weekend.

asked that the "USS mccain"
which is a warship named after

after an American hero and tell
the sailors who work on it to

Not one of them has spoken up.

sinful. And the reason we were
