1
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:34,558
- Hey, folks.
- It's that time again, right?

2
00:00:34,634 --> 00:00:35,726
Yeah.

3
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,028
Good size?

4
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,275
Come on, guys. Hurry up.

5
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,329
You good?

6
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,084
- What's going on?
- We're all set.

7
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:32,420
- You guys ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready. You ready?

8
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,983
- Let's do this.
- All right. Let's do it. Fuck this.

9
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:53,811
Get down! Get down!

10
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,507
- Get down! Don't make me fucking do it.
- Oh, my God!

11
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:58,949
- Get down! Get down! Don't move.
- Get your hands up.

12
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,485
There you go.

13
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,788
Nice and easy. Nobody gets hurt.

14
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,882
We don't need any heroes.

15
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,817
Ready?

16
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,822
- Police! Freeze!
- Let's go!

17
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,267
Freeze!

18
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:20,398
Drop your weapon! Now! I said now!

19
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,805
Let's go! Get in the car!

20
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:25,541
What are you doing?

21
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,739
- Oh, my God!
- Get in the car!

22
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:32,251
<i>One thing that always stuck with me</i>
<i>on the streets,</i>

23
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,683
<i>never do armored trucks.</i>

24
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,402
- Thanks.
- Yeah, no problem.

25
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:52,285
Over there.

26
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,722
Hey! Son of a bitch!

27
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,626
Hey! You little bastards, get back here!

28
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,073
No menthols.

29
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,504
Why don't you guys have
a couple of Cokes? Go sit over there.

30
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,912
I got some stuff to do.
I'll be with you in a minute.

31
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:27,655
Where'd you get the cigarettes?

32
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:29,627
Fell off a truck.

33
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:31,391
Twice in one week?

34
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:35,031
How'd you like to do an errand for me?

35
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,625
- Sure.
- Depends.

36
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,803
- Did you go down to Williams yet?
- Not yet.

37
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,132
I want you to go down to Williams Tavern
and pick up an envelope.

38
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:43,641
- Can you handle that?
- Sure.

39
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,109
How much?

40
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,613
How much. Listen to this kid. "How much?"

41
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,546
Fifty bucks. Is that enough?

42
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,277
- Sure.
- Sure.

43
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,887
Brian.

44
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,792
Brian. Brian.

45
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,262
We have to be quiet.

46
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:16,702
This is nice, Stacy. Come here.

47
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:19,973
We can't do nothing
'cause my mother's upstairs.

48
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:31,423
Hey, hey. No hanging around. Call it a night.

49
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,788
What do you think of this coat, Jackie?
A little too big?

50
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,329
- No, it looks good.
- It looks good.

51
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,594
- How'd you make out? Did you find him?
- We got him.

52
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,193
It's cold out.

53
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:46,966
Oh, yeah. It's colder where he is.

54
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,411
Get him out. Get him out.
Come on. Come on.

55
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,114
- Come on. Get out. Get out.
- Come on, out! Out!

56
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,487
Get him in the back. Hurry up.

57
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,794
Get in. Get in there.

58
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:19,102
- So fuck me, huh?
- What?

59
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,469
Fuck me?

60
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,805
- No, no, it's okay. Say it. Fuck me.
- Listen, I never said...

61
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:27,209
Didn't I tell you any money made
around here, I see a piece of it?

62
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,372
You did.

63
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,441
And what have you given me?
What have you given me?

64
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,883
I haven't...

65
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,922
Don't you scream!
Don't you fucking scream!

66
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,682
I'll put a fucking hole right in you again.

67
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:47,224
I always wonder why people scream
when they're in pain, Jackie.

68
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,962
It's like when they slurp coffee
thinking it's gonna change the temperature,

69
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,561
- but it doesn't.
- You're right. It doesn't change a thing.

70
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,732
I get a kick out of guys like you.
I see you around the neighborhood,

71
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:59,107
playing your gangster roles,
tough guys, arms folded,

72
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,181
talking out of the side of your mouth.
Now look at him.

73
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,273
I can't believe it.

74
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:07,080
Didn't you put that Sweeney kid
in the hospital for money he owed you?

75
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,648
So you're a fucking bully, too, right?
Oh, yeah, you are.

76
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:15,091
- What's that kid, 150 pounds, Jackie?
- Tops.

77
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:20,026
- You got my money on you?
- No.

78
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,062
Do you got the money you owe me on you?

79
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:24,629
No.

80
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,189
Here, cut this up.

81
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,490
That prick down at Williams Tavern
is ducking me again.

82
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:54,692
Go down and get some money off him,
will you?

83
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,428
Another slow week.

84
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,132
I'm sick and tired
of all this nickel-and-dime bullshit.

85
00:09:09,148 --> 00:09:10,843
I'm not gonna wait all day
for this cocksucker.

86
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,484
Hey, guys, what's up?

87
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:22,852
Fuck!

88
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,529
Do you wanna get involved?

89
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,572
- Are you gonna be warm enough?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

90
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,111
- You don't need a sweater?
- No.

91
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:41,339
- You sure?
- Yeah.

92
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,676
All right.

93
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,273
- Oh, good. You're just in time.
- For what?

94
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,545
Sean's game.

95
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,179
I can't. I'm running right back out.
I gotta go.

96
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:50,888
- Where are the...
- It's the playoffs.

97
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:54,415
I can't. I'm busy.
I'll catch your next game. I promise.

98
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,319
What's to eat?

99
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,211
...from behind, duct-taped me...

100
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,080
- Does it sound like that?
- Yeah.

101
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,344
- Hey! That's them right there.
- Look who it is.

102
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,716
Yeah. With a scar over there.

103
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,778
- A thing of beauty.
- How'd that tape treat you?

104
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,723
It's all right. It's all right.
Almost took my mustache off.

105
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,316
- What'd you tell them?
- I didn't tell them nothing.

106
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,827
I told them they better find
the guys who did it

107
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:30,884
'cause I'm not paying for that shit

108
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:31,952
- out of my own pocket.
- That's right.

109
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,794
- What are you having?
- I'll take a cold beer.

110
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,800
- Give him a cold beer.
- Thank you.

111
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:36,994
Yeah.

112
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:40,561
- Good job, good job.
- Wrists almost ripped off, mustache is gone.

113
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,130
I gotta hit the head. I'll talk to you later.

114
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:50,443
Hey, come here, boys.
Hey, boys, I got you something.

115
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,211
Come here, shorty.

116
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,119
What are you doing out in the rain?

117
00:10:54,186 --> 00:10:55,585
- Come over here.
- Something for everybody.

118
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,348
Hey, there's your ma.

119
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,360
Hey, Stacy. Hey, Katie.

120
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,396
- Call me later.
- I'll give you a call around 8:00, all right?

121
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,125
- Hey, Katie.
- Hi, Brian.

122
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,724
- Yo, Katie, you want a ride home?
- Yeah.

123
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,498
- Say goodbye to your Uncle Paulie.
- Bye.

124
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:16,068
Pay some bills.
Get yourself a little something.

125
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:19,207
Thanks. Are you staying for supper
or are you running out?

126
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,337
Yeah, yeah. Do you mind?

127
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:26,252
- The good old days.
- Yeah.

128
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,413
- The good old days.
- Yeah.

129
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,318
He's upstairs.

130
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,016
- What's his name?
- Marius.

131
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,615
Marius. Yeah, Marius.

132
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,718
Might as well go talk to him.
See what he has to say.

133
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,285
$5,000 is $5,000, right?

134
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,263
- Yeah.
- All right.

135
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,098
- Jackie, again the soup is freezing.
- Again, cold?

136
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,799
- Tell Hogie, "Hogie, the soup's freezing!"
- You gotta be kidding me.

137
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:52,501
- Marius, how you doing?
- I'm not too good.

138
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,644
Here's what happened.

139
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,914
I'm 60 years old, so I had this indiscretion

140
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,818
with this young manicurist
on Newbury Street,

141
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:08,657
and then this cunt and her boyfriend
called my wife!

142
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,855
Hold it. Indiscretion? You're losing us.

143
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,524
- I was fucking her. I was fucking her.
- What?

144
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:17,797
- He was cheating on his wife.
- I want them to pay, especially her.

145
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,963
Wait a minute.
You want us to slap a girl around?

146
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,631
No, no, no. You see,

147
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,973
this bitch has these two poodles
that she loves like her own children.

148
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,343
I want you to kidnap the female.

149
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,214
Now, it has to be the female.
I don't care what you do to the guy.

150
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:33,342
I'll pay you five grand.

151
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:37,185
Let me get this straight.
You want us to kidnap a poodle?

152
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,416
Yeah.

153
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,659
Do you think we're a couple of jerk-offs?
No, you're making fun of us.

154
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:45,527
- No, no, no! No, but you see...
- No, hey, hey!

155
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,897
Giving a guy a beating is one thing,
all right? But kidnapping a fucking dog...

156
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,697
No, no, but you don't understand.

157
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,500
She's the one that has to pay.
She called my wife.

158
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:57,440
- The guy's a fucking nut.
- Five grand is five grand, Paulie.

159
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,672
I'm not doing it.

160
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:03,408
- Come on, we'll get some kid for a C-note.
- Hey, I'm not doing it.

161
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:07,680
Kidnap a fucking poodle.
What are you, out of your mind?

162
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,279
I know you don't like this,

163
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,688
but I think we should seriously consider
doing an armored car.

164
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:15,056
Don't start with that again.
Don't start with that again.

165
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,185
Everybody gets caught.

166
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:20,164
You gotta do it in broad daylight.
Everybody sees you. It's impossible.

167
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:22,996
All right? Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

168
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:24,865
Brian! Brian! I got him.

169
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,269
- I got the motherfucker.
- Spread his legs. Let me see.

170
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,034
It's got balls.
Go in there and get the other one.

171
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,168
- They're vicious maniacs!
- Get the fuck back in there.

172
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:38,105
It's not funny. It's a fucking poodle.
It's not funny.

173
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,412
- It's kind of funny.
- Brian, it's not funny.

174
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,352
- It's not funny. It's embarrassing.
- A little funny.

175
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:48,621
- What are we gonna do?
- I got this kid, Anthony, all right?

176
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,819
He's making a lot of money,
and he don't answer to anybody.

177
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,456
What about Pat?

178
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,163
We gotta start making our own money.

179
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,700
That rat McGill is giving up everyone.

180
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,308
No wonder,
with the deals they're giving today.

181
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,278
I should've killed that prick
when I had the chance.

182
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,942
- Yeah. Definitely.
- We took care of that.

183
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,575
Yeah, he called.

184
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,882
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hey, Jackie.

185
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,487
Here you go.

186
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:23,292
He said $5,000.

187
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,557
Yeah, that's your cut.
You got a problem with that, Paulie?

188
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:27,656
- Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do.
- You do?

189
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,167
Yeah, yeah. You know what, Pat? Keep it.

190
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:32,670
Hey, come here. Come here. Come here!

191
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:35,104
Who the fuck you think you're talking to,
some fucking punk?

192
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,641
I've been lining your pockets
since you were a kid!

193
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:37,801
If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have shit!

194
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,139
That's not the point, Pat.

195
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,644
The point is
it's supposed to be getting easier.

196
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,943
You think you're the only one
with problems? I got heat up my ass,

197
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,540
and you've been moping around here
for months with this fucking attitude,

198
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:47,483
and I'm tired of it. You better work on that

199
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,420
because I'm telling you, we're gonna have
a fucking problem! You got that?

200
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:51,956
You got that?

201
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:59,226
You better talk to him, Brian.

202
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,861
You see what I'm talking about?
You see what I'm fucking talking about?

203
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,564
He treats us like
we're a couple of fucking assholes!

204
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,334
Okay, relax, Paul.

205
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,433
Come on. Let me in. Let me in!

206
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,804
What'd he say to you, huh?

207
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:19,148
Then we drive off with the truck.
That's it. It's that simple.

208
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,482
- Who is this guy?
- George Shea. I've known him for years.

209
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,248
He's solid.

210
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,449
He's not gonna try to fuck us on the price?

211
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:26,582
- No?
- No.

212
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,127
We get paid that night,
and then we're on our way.

213
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,559
Does he have to know who we are?

214
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:33,928
He doesn't care how the TVs get there,
as long as they get there.

215
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,399
All right, Anthony, we'll see you tonight.

216
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,833
All right, cool. Call me.

217
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,106
Hey, Brian, why don't you go home?

218
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:46,038
- Why don't you mind your business, Katie?
- You know, he's got a girl.

219
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,341
Hey, do me a favor,
tell Paulie to come over here, will you?

220
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,177
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, and then go home.

221
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,843
Why don't you buy me a fucking drink?

222
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,112
- Hey, Paulie.
- Yeah, what?

223
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,212
Brian wants to talk to you.

224
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,223
Okay. All right. Two seconds.
So you got a place to...

225
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:00,917
- I gotta pay the bills.
- You gotta pay the bills?

226
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,291
I'll pay your bills. You got a place to stay?

227
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,158
- You'll pay my bills?
- That's right, I'll pay your bills.

228
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,993
- All right, well, I'm on a couch right now.
- You're on a...

229
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:08,260
I'll go on the couch, you go...

230
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,858
Why don't you stay at my house?
What's your name?

231
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:12,369
- How big is your couch?
- How big is my couch?

232
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,837
- My name is Lisa.
- My couch is big enough.

233
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:16,101
All right, Lisa,
I'm gonna go talk to my friend.

234
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:17,608
I'm gonna come back,
and I'm gonna talk to you.

235
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:22,306
We're gonna talk some more
about my couch, all right? Holy fucking shit.

236
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,714
Deal me out.

237
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,442
Yeah, no problem.

238
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,589
- You know that kid Jay?
- What, the kid behind me?

239
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,592
Yeah. He's making a lot of money
with that coke.

240
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,493
- Yeah? How do you know?
- I just do.

241
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,997
- We should get some from him.
- Who's he with?

242
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,556
- Nobody, that's my point.
- Let's go.

243
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:52,407
- Hey, Jay, can we talk to you for a minute?
- Yeah, yeah.

244
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:54,746
- Hey, cute girl.
- Yeah, I know her.

245
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:58,380
- Hey, kid. Did you see Charlie?
- How you been?

246
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:00,179
- You know Paulie, right?
- Yeah.

247
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,344
- How's it going?
- Good.

248
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,389
Hey, Jay, we want to talk to you tomorrow.
Is that all right?

249
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,890
- What about? Everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

250
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,928
You want to meet us at the Heights
at 2:00 tomorrow?

251
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:13,294
- All right.
- Don't worry. Have a good time tonight.

252
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,627
Hey, Pat.

253
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,331
- How you doing?
- All right.

254
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,670
- Busy, huh?
- Yeah.

255
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:27,701
Hey, you two haven't heard
of a truck full of TVs disappearing, did you?

256
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,748
- No.
- Nothing?

257
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:34,210
- You sure?
- Yeah, we're sure.

258
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:35,651
It's funny, I got a call from...

259
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,849
Well, anyway, you keep your ears open.
Let me know if you hear anything, will you?

260
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:40,585
Yeah. No problem.

261
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,591
All right.

262
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,459
Greedy prick.

263
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,166
Hey. Hey, guys.

264
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,367
- Shit.
- All right, let's go.

265
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,305
Sean, help your brother. Here's your bag.

266
00:17:57,709 --> 00:18:00,234
- Why don't you go wait in the kitchen?
- All right, be good. Learn a lot.

267
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:03,678
That's great.
Here, Sean, help him put on his jacket.

268
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,580
I can't get the zipper.

269
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,254
It's 8:00 in the morning.
Where the hell have you been?

270
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,087
- Out. Out.
- Where?

271
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:17,785
- Where?
- I don't want to hear it. Here.

272
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,998
Like this solves everything.

273
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,560
Come on.

274
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:27,500
Come on.

275
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,274
- Brian, this has gotta stop.
- Yeah, okay.

276
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:36,736
All right, yeah, whatever you say.
I won't do it again.

277
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,219
For the last time, just let me get some sleep.

278
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,786
- Yeah?
- Hey, it's me.

279
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,124
<i>- Jackie wants to see us.</i>
- For what?

280
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,857
I don't know. He didn't say anything.

281
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,062
All right. I'll be there.

282
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:58,993
Feds got Pat.

283
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,830
For what?

284
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:05,399
They're trying to pin some old bullshit
murder rap on him.

285
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,501
For when? Who?

286
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:08,478
- You know that prick, Mickey Gills?
- Yeah.

287
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,310
He's been flipping on everybody
from years ago,

288
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,713
trying to get his sentence cut in half.

289
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,047
What's he looking at?

290
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,282
If he pleads out to manslaughter, eight.

291
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:23,094
Hey, don't worry about it, though.
It'll be all right.

292
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,097
- Nothing changes.
- Yeah, sure.

293
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,189
- Of course.
- Nothing.

294
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,526
- I can't fucking believe it.
- What do you think?

295
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,092
I think it's time to go see that kid.

296
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,880
She's not going to mind doing it, you know,
coming to tell me...

297
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,211
Hey, Jay.

298
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:47,047
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

299
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,753
No problem. Nice car.

300
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:53,181
Thanks.

301
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,055
You're making good money
with that coke, huh?

302
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,617
I'm doing all right.

303
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,162
Personally, I don't care
how you make your money.

304
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,788
You don't sell it to the kids, right?

305
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,594
- No.
- Let's cut to the chase, all right?

306
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,658
You're making a lot of money with that,
and we want some.

307
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,134
All right. So you got two choices.

308
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,434
You can either come up
with a little something each week,

309
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:12,136
or, better yet, you can set up some dealers,
we'll rob them and cut you in.

310
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,113
- You want me to set up my connections?
- Yeah.

311
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,508
I can't do that. They know me.

312
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:22,042
- They know where the fuck I live.
- Yeah, but so do we.

313
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,213
Brian, are you gonna put me on the spot?

314
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,985
I known you how long?
We're from the same neighborhood.

315
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,653
- What am I supposed to do?
- Jay, fuck them.

316
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,501
So if this goes good, they say
they might need 50 pounds every 10 days.

317
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,164
- I got all you need, man.
- Yeah, I bet.

318
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,569
- I'll go get them.
- All right, I'll be here.

319
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,884
Hey, what's going on?

320
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,019
- Oh, God.
- Relax, Tommy, you're gonna be okay.

321
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:06,360
- Jay, what's going on?
- Bad day for you, Tommy.

322
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:10,395
Just chalk it up as a loss, Tommy.
You'll make it back in a couple of weeks.

323
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,596
I'll take this. Thank you.

324
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:16,936
Okay. In case you get stupid,
that look familiar?

325
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:19,977
Jay, stuff in the back?

326
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,704
- Trunk open, Tommy?
- Yeah.

327
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,873
Tommy, I'm gonna take the keys.

328
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,076
I'm gonna throw them in the alley
around the corner.

329
00:21:26,151 --> 00:21:28,745
Give yourself a few minutes
to pull yourself together.

330
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,482
When you go back to Braintree,
you don't mention any of this to anybody.

331
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,456
- Got it?
- Yeah.

332
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,895
- Try these out.
- They're too big. I'm a seven.

333
00:21:48,073 --> 00:21:49,233
- What?
- These are big.

334
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,367
All right, just put another pair of socks on.
They'll be fine.

335
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,308
- Don't worry, I'll get you another pair.
- That won't work.

336
00:21:53,378 --> 00:21:55,938
Hey, you got it on the wrong foot, boss.

337
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:00,307
Hey, you want to help your brother
when you're done? You guys hungry?

338
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,478
- Yeah, I guess.
- All right.

339
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,397
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

340
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,090
You look good.

341
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:22,164
Hey, Brian. How are you doing?

342
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,231
- I'm okay.
- Yeah? Can I get you something to drink?

343
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:26,140
Yeah. Stacy?

344
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,172
- I'm all set.
- Okay. The usual?

345
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:31,078
No. Yeah, give me...

346
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:33,709
No, I'm gonna have... Give me just whatever
you got on tap. Thanks.

347
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:34,945
Okay.

348
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,548
Friend of yours?

349
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,958
What do you mean "friend"?
She works here.

350
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,262
What?

351
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,001
Are you mad now
because the waitress knows my name?

352
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,838
Then why are you getting all quiet
all of a sudden?

353
00:22:58,944 --> 00:22:59,968
How come you didn't introduce me?

354
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,445
What are you talking about?
She's the waitress.

355
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,675
I thought she just might be more than that,
the way you eyed her.

356
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,479
See? That's why we never go out.

357
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:10,214
We never go out because you're always
too busy running around.

358
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:22,633
You want to start this all over again?

359
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,192
Let's not ruin a nice night, okay?

360
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:29,262
I would've introduced you,
but I don't even know her name.

361
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,400
Here you go, honey.

362
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,603
- I'm sorry, what's your name?
- Kim.

363
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:34,702
- Kim.
- Yeah.

364
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,805
- Kim, this is my wife Stacy.
- Hi.

365
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,043
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

366
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:41,517
- You need a few minutes?
- Just one.

367
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,816
Okay, I'll be back. Thanks.

368
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,726
- We okay now?
- Yeah.

369
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,793
Excuse me,
can I get a couple of menus, please?

370
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,061
Sorry.

371
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,460
Take your time.

372
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,305
Here.

373
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:07,777
- No, no, she meant it for you, I think.
- Take it, please.

374
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,346
Charlie, can we have a couple of minutes?

375
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:15,977
- Sure.
- Thanks, man.

376
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,214
Hey, Brian.

377
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,486
- Hey, Jay. How'd you make out?
- Paulie.

378
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,552
- Not bad. $900 a pound.
- $900 a pound.

379
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,722
That's 45 grand.

380
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,732
So, what, 12.5 for you?

381
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:31,864
- That sound good to you?
- Yeah, that sounds good.

382
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:33,962
- That's good, yeah.
- All right, let's do it.

383
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,769
Listen, I gotta get going,
but I'm gonna see that guy Friday.

384
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,241
- All right. Okay.
- Okay?

385
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,369
I gotta run, too.

386
00:24:40,445 --> 00:24:42,777
Well, don't forget we got that guy
at 1:00, 1:30.

387
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:46,545
- Forty-five grand, that's not bad.
- That's good. Good job.

388
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,915
Hey, Jay.

389
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,782
You got a little bit of that shit on you
until Friday?

390
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,223
Yeah, yeah.

391
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,119
- Thanks.
- See you Friday.

392
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:00,256
It's a good business, Paulie.
Jewelry is always in demand.

393
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,492
Yeah, yeah, all right,
but just so we're on the same page,

394
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,058
I give you 10 grand now,

395
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:07,662
then you give me 200 a week for a year,
plus my 10 grand back.

396
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:09,832
- Yeah, definitely.
- Okay, that'll work.

397
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,671
I'll be back in a minute.

398
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:12,767
All right.

399
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,105
- Who is it?
- Brian.

400
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,147
- Hey, Jay.
- What's up, Brian?

401
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,277
I was wondering
if you have any of that money yet.

402
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,221
I told you I wasn't gonna have it till Friday.
Hey, come in, come in.

403
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,781
Thanks. You having a party?

404
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,089
- Yeah, you want a drink?
- Sure.

405
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,263
Hey, Brian, what's up? I'm Matt.

406
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,198
Hey. How you doing?
Yeah, I've seen you around.

407
00:25:37,802 --> 00:25:39,667
- Here.
- Yeah, I'll take that.

408
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,670
What do you got?

409
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,641
- How much, Brian?
- A "G."

410
00:25:45,277 --> 00:25:46,710
I don't have a "G." I don't have...

411
00:25:46,778 --> 00:25:48,609
Jay, come on. What do you got?

412
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,480
I don't... I could give you like 500.

413
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,315
I'll take that. You got some coke, too?

414
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,752
Yeah, give me a second.

415
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,289
Fuck them, Jay. Fuck them!

416
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,793
- These your girlfriends?
- No, they're strippers.

417
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,097
- Oh, yeah? You're a dancer?
- Yeah.

418
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,262
Show me some of your moves.

419
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,474
Nice. Let's see the backside.

420
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:18,839
Nice.

421
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,111
Tim, how you doing?

422
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:24,273
Yeah, set me up.

423
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:26,377
I'll set you up.

424
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:30,283
- What's that you're smoking? Crack?
- Yeah.

425
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,381
You guys are freebasers, huh?
It's like a morgue in here.

426
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,517
I want to be dead like you.

427
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,695
Here's the five, Brian.
Plenty of coke, all right?

428
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:46,699
Come on, no more coke for you.

429
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,873
That's not bad.

430
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,273
- You gotta suck it in real hard.
- Okay.

431
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,107
When it fills up with smoke,
take your finger off.

432
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,511
All right, I think I got it now.

433
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,103
Where is he? Everything all right?

434
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:25,870
- What do you mean? He's not here?
- No, he never came home.

435
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:29,539
- Weren't you with him last night?
- Yeah, yeah, I was with him earlier.

436
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,639
- This is it. I've had it.
- What?

437
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,445
Every night he's out until 3:00,
4:00 in the morning.

438
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,315
- Take it easy.
- You take it easy!

439
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,981
- Stace. Stace.
- 15 years of this shit.

440
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,283
I know.

441
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:47,492
12:00 in the afternoon?
You're the biggest asshole...

442
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:51,228
I just spent the night locked up!
Leave me the fuck alone!

443
00:27:58,943 --> 00:28:00,171
Hello?

444
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,470
He just got in.

445
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,078
It's Paul.

446
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:13,989
- Yeah, tell him I'll call him back.
- He's gonna call you back.

447
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,859
I don't know, some bullshit
about being arrested. I gotta go.

448
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,492
So what happened?

449
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:23,166
Nothing. I was just with some broad.

450
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,371
- You okay?
- Yeah.

451
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,510
Jay! Jay! Jay!

452
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,083
Almost had a touchdown there.

453
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,021
I got your message. What's up?

454
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:54,224
Yeah. Remember that kid Matt
you met at my house the other night?

455
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,426
- Yeah, yeah. What about him?
- When was this?

456
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:57,661
What?

457
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:00,494
Last week sometime. What about him?

458
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,040
Well, he sells steroids
to these muscle-heads out in Stoneham.

459
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:04,132
Yeah? There's money in that?

460
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,769
- I guess. He says 20 to 30 grand.
- 20 to 30 grand?

461
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,142
Yeah! Yeah.

462
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,204
Well, anyways,
he's been dealing a few years.

463
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,374
His connection just got busted.

464
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:15,681
These fucking clowns keep paging him
every day for more. They don't know.

465
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,654
- Is he for real?
- I figured you guys might want to take them.

466
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:19,485
- No bullshit.
- Yeah.

467
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:20,956
You know, it sounds good.

468
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:24,552
Sounds real good. All right,
we'll give you a call tomorrow. Thanks.

469
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,153
- Thanks, Jay.
- Paulie.

470
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:27,220
Be good.

471
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,434
You go over to his house?

472
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,532
What? I went to see if he had the money.

473
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,473
This guy's pumping coke, man.
You don't think he's being watched?

474
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:39,733
Use your head.

475
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,013
- I went there for two minutes.
- Yeah, well.

476
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,942
- That mine?
- Yeah.

477
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:21,247
Thanks. Hey, who won the Celtics game?

478
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,253
- Cavs by eight.
- Fuck me.

479
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,118
- You bet those bums again?
- Yeah.

480
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:27,056
Fucking Celtics.

481
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:29,920
What'd you say?

482
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:38,801
- Who is that fucking guy?
- I don't know. I never saw him before, Brian.

483
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,274
What the fuck's that guy named? Dave?

484
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:46,837
Hey, it's me.

485
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,141
Who is this? Matt?

486
00:30:50,148 --> 00:30:51,945
Do me a favor, will you?

487
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,746
Cook me up some of that shit.
I'm coming over right now.

488
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:58,186
- Hey, you got something to say to me?
- I didn't say nothing to you.

489
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:02,219
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

490
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,728
Yeah.

491
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:10,734
So, Jay said something
about some steroid score.

492
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:14,465
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I got these guys, right?
- Fuck me.

493
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,167
- They got a lot of money.
- Yeah?

494
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:19,642
- A lot of money.
- What's the deal?

495
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,240
I'll set them up.

496
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,079
- Hey, they got a lot of money, you know.
- Okay.

497
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,653
Yeah.

498
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:40,522
- I think one of them is rich.
- Okay, dude.

499
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:45,868
What the fuck. Who's that?

500
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:56,009
- Who is it?
- Get away from me.

501
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:01,408
- Hey, how much money am I gonna get?
- Come on, man. Get off of me for a second.

502
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,612
You guys are gonna take care of me
with some of that money, right?

503
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,589
Matt, Matt, shut the fuck up.

504
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:09,149
- I just wanna know how much I'm gonna get.
- Matt, shut the fuck up!

505
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,593
- Matt, what the fuck's going on? Huh?
- Nothing.

506
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:12,960
How many times did I fucking tell you?

507
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:14,123
- Brian.
- What?

508
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:15,927
This is my house. It's 3:00 in the morning.

509
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,491
- Come on.
- You're right. You're right. Sorry, Jay.

510
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:19,968
I'm sorry.

511
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,914
How many times did I fucking tell you, Matt?

512
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:41,149
No one in the fucking house!
Clean the fuck up, you fucking clown!

513
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:01,942
Thanks, Charlie.

514
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:05,642
Look, one thing you gotta do is make sure
that he brings the money inside, all right?

515
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:10,347
Insist on that. Tell him that the steroids
are in the cellar in a cooler. All right?

516
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:14,255
Once he comes in,
we'll take care of the rest, all right? Right?

517
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,184
Yeah.

518
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,694
All right.
What time are you supposed to meet him?

519
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,425
2:00 on Thursday.

520
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:25,959
2:00. All right, at 2:30, we'll be in the back
at the sandwich counter, all right?

521
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,871
See you later, guys.

522
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:36,539
What happened to you last night?

523
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,674
Nothing. I had to do some stuff with Stacy.

524
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,679
We gotta be sharp on this.

525
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:44,885
Naturally.

526
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,986
- Hey, Matt.
- Yo, hey. Paulie.

527
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,394
- Hey, what's up.
- Yeah, good, good.

528
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,456
- How's everything going?
- Yeah, good. You want a seat?

529
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,059
- You want a sandwich or something?
- No, I think I'm okay.

530
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:03,004
- Well, you got the money?
- Yeah, do you have the juice?

531
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,408
Yeah, it's in the freezer. Have a seat.
Now, seriously...

532
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:09,173
- What, you want something?
- No, man, I'm okay. Why don't we...

533
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:13,343
- It's all right. It's all right. It's on me.
- No, believe me, I'm fine. I appreciate it.

534
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:15,215
You know what? You guys just sit tight,

535
00:34:15,286 --> 00:34:19,620
and I'll go grab the money, all right?
I'll be right back.

536
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,553
I told him to bring it in.

537
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,529
We told you
to have him bring the fucking money in!

538
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,259
I know, I told him,
but he was threatening me.

539
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,393
Get the fuck in the car!
Something's going on.

540
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,071
- Hurry up!
- Boston PD! Hey!

541
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,902
Put your hands up! Hands on the dash!

542
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:38,874
Hey! Do not fucking move!

543
00:34:38,943 --> 00:34:41,104
All right, here. Hands on the...
Give me the keys.

544
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,613
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Put your hands on the dash!

545
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,615
- You selling any drugs down here?
- No, sir.

546
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,082
So, you're down here
making a drug deal, huh?

547
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:49,210
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Shut the fuck up!

548
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:50,777
Are you making drug deals down here?

549
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,015
- No.
- Where's the money?

550
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,523
- Where's the money?
- What money?

551
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,580
- Where's the money?
- Shut the fuck up!

552
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,093
Joe, get an answer out of him!

553
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:01,530
Christ! We're not gonna get an answer
like that! Fucking prick!

554
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,324
- Shit! Where is the money?
- I don't know what you're talking about!

555
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,563
The fucking money! Where's the money?

556
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:10,573
Oh, yeah. You don't know what
I'm talking about, huh? You lying prick.

557
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:11,903
Let's go!

558
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,980
What the fuck are you looking at?

559
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,347
- Hey!
- Mind your fucking business!

560
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,216
- Somebody help us!
- Where's the key?

561
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,152
Hey, somebody help us! Call a doctor!

562
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,251
Let me ask you something.
How old are you?

563
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,624
- I'll be 27 next week.
- No, you're not.

564
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:33,289
Fuck! She looks like she's 22, don't she?

565
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,127
No, no, you look good.
You look really good.

566
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,394
- Thanks. Yeah, I gotta get back to work.
- No, sit down, sit down.

567
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:38,958
- Joe wants to talk to you.
- You're gonna get me fired.

568
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,298
I wanna talk to you. I wanna talk to you.

569
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:44,831
No, you don't have to work.
All right, I'll come with you. I'll help you.

570
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,309
- Hey, Jay. How you doing?
- Brian, what's going on?

571
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,402
I want you to meet my buddy, Josh.

572
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,709
Hey, Josh. How you doing?
Have a seat over here.

573
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,680
What, your boy run off
in the middle of a score?

574
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,413
- He does shit like that all the time, Brian.
- I'm sorry I took off, but you know...

575
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,978
What are you doing, running off on a score?
You don't have any balls?

576
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,523
No, I do, but it was getting crazy.

577
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:02,423
- You were gonna kill those guys.
- I don't give a fuck!

578
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,155
Here. Here's a few bucks for you.
You're lucky you're getting that.

579
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,629
No, don't sit down here! Get over there!

580
00:36:07,698 --> 00:36:10,895
No, come on, sit down.
Man, I'm fucking with you.

581
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:13,059
Hey, can you get him a drink?

582
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:14,729
We need to talk.

583
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,400
- Come on, Jay.
- Listen, listen, relax.

584
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,139
What's going on?

585
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:24,943
What do you mean?

586
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,745
What do I mean? I'm talking scores.

587
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:29,650
You just robbed two guys up on E Street.

588
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,984
What are you getting at, Jackie?

589
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,991
You two are out there on your own,
and we don't see a dime?

590
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:36,356
What do you want from us?

591
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:38,861
We been running around
like a couple of fucking errand boys for you

592
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,625
for 15 years,
and what do we have to show for it?

593
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,292
Nothing. All right,
so we make a few extra bucks on the side.

594
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,800
Errand boys? That's how you see it?

595
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,167
That ain't the point, Jackie.
I got kids to feed, and I'm broke.

596
00:36:47,238 --> 00:36:50,207
And we don't? Hey, Pat is pissed about this.

597
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:53,141
You keep it up,
you're gonna have a problem.

598
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:57,243
- Are you threatening us?
- I don't threaten nobody.

599
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,179
All right, man, if that's the way it is.
I don't know what else to say.

600
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,154
That's the way it is.

601
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,352
- You need a ride home?
- No, I'm all set.

602
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,156
Hey, listen, I'm gonna be out of here
in about 15 minutes.

603
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,995
- I just gotta clean up.
- No, I'm fine, thanks. Here you go.

604
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,220
You motherfucker!

605
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,132
Motherfucker.

606
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:56,607
<i>Dr. Evans, dial 283.</i>

607
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:58,300
- Mrs. Reilly.
- Yes.

608
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,365
Hi.

609
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,569
Here's the situation.

610
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,444
As you know, your husband
has been struck by three bullets.

611
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:07,006
One is lodged in the back of his head,
one's been removed from his right shoulder,

612
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:09,348
and one from his left forearm.

613
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:10,914
The bullet in the back of his head,

614
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:14,048
we have decided not to go ahead
with the surgery to remove it

615
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,616
because we feel it would be too dangerous
at this time, okay?

616
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:18,161
It's too close to the spinal cord,

617
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:20,720
and it would be too dangerous
to go in and retrieve that bullet.

618
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:24,666
What we want to do is
we want to keep him here and observe him,

619
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:28,637
and we want to give him a lot of antibiotics,
and he should be okay.

620
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:32,369
We're very lucky that it was
a very small caliber bullet, so...

621
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:33,705
I do think you should know

622
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:38,044
that there were large traces
of cocaine and alcohol in his system.

623
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,586
He says he's gonna be fine.

624
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,646
I couldn't tell you.
This guy had a hood over his head.

625
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,089
- I couldn't see his face.
- Fuck him.

626
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,855
I just saw him standing there with the pistol.

627
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,563
- Who do you think, if you had to say?
- I don't know. I couldn't say.

628
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:58,466
- Do you think it was that prick Jackie?
- I wish I knew. I really do.

629
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,561
- Hi.
- I'll be back.

630
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,600
- Hey. How are you?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

631
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,476
I'm all right. Come on, give me a kiss.

632
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,207
- My God, I can't even get to you.
- Get over that thing.

633
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,376
Don't move your arm.

634
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,854
He's gonna be all right. I've got some water
right here for him if he wants.

635
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:22,518
- Stace, I'm gonna be right outside.
- Hi, Katie.

636
00:39:22,593 --> 00:39:24,356
- The boys okay?
- They're fine.

637
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,419
- Are they okay?
- Yeah, they're good.

638
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,694
They're with my father. Don't worry
about anything. I gotta call work...

639
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,327
- No, no, no, I'm okay.
...get someone to cover for me.

640
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,395
- I'm just gonna go to sleep anyway.
- What, are you crazy? I can't.

641
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,374
You gotta get home.
The boys are gonna worry.

642
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,602
- Hey, Paulie.
- Hey, Hogie.

643
00:39:42,646 --> 00:39:45,137
- How's Brian doing?
- I don't know. He's in the fucking hospital

644
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,616
with a shitload of holes in him.
How do you think he's doing, huh?

645
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,050
Did you see anything?

646
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,521
No, I was stocking the bar.
Brian was the last to go.

647
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,285
Ten minutes later,
I found him on the sidewalk.

648
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,553
Hey, Paulie, how's he doing?

649
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,156
Did you do it?

650
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,895
What are you, out of your mind?
I'm gonna shoot Brian?

651
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,267
Come on, I've known you guys
since you were kids.

652
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:10,899
Whatever you two were doing,
you brought this on yourselves.

653
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:13,900
So, how is he?

654
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,637
He's gonna live.

655
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,548
- I feel like I'm going fucking crazy.
- Come on, have a seat. Sit down.

656
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,321
Oh, no, sorry. You had the roast beef.

657
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,187
This one's for him.

658
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,385
I can't even remember a fucking order.

659
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,186
Thanks.

660
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,929
- How you doing?
- Pretty good. You?

661
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:39,366
Hey! Hey!

662
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,164
- Stace?
- Yeah?

663
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,571
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

664
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,769
Now, I know I've said this before,
but this has gotta stop.

665
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,835
- He's killing you with this shit.
- I know.

666
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,108
- You have got to get away from him.
- Katie, please, not now.

667
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:53,480
You know what?
You say this every single time,

668
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,883
- and every single time you go back...
- I got nowhere to go!

669
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,386
- Really?
- I got two kids!

670
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,581
- Oh, okay.
- Where am I gonna go?

671
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:01,522
You think you're the only person
who's ever been in this situation before?

672
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,686
- I can't hear this now.
- Stacy!

673
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,126
I'll call you later.

674
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,355
- Please push the button.
- I already pushed it.

675
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:11,800
There she is. Excuse me, nurse.
Can I please get some pain medicine?

676
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,060
You have an hour to go.

677
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,765
No, I don't have an hour to go.
I've already waited a fucking hour.

678
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,603
I want some pain medicine, okay?

679
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:20,041
- You need to calm down.
- No, I don't need to calm down.

680
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,941
- I need to get some pain medicine.
- Brian, quiet!

681
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:23,877
- No, there's no reason...
- You just have to be patient.

682
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:27,179
There's no reason that I need to sit here
in pain. Now, can I just please have a...

683
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,378
Whatever you got.
Just give me a little bit of something.

684
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,718
- You need to just wait one more hour.
- I'm in fucking pain here, okay?

685
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:35,054
I don't know what it takes
for you to understand that!

686
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:37,355
- How long you been working here?
- This is my second week.

687
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,827
Right! Figures!

688
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:41,160
- Give me some fucking pain medicine!
- Brian! Brian, lower your voice.

689
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:42,824
- Now!
- I'll go get the doctor.

690
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,130
- Get the doctor!
- Look at you. Look at you.

691
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,636
- This is insane. What are you doing to us?
- Not right now, Stacy.

692
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,332
What about your boys?
If you're not gonna think about me,

693
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:50,600
- think about your boys.
- Not right fucking now!

694
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:55,304
Yes, now! You're a drug addict.
You're out every night doing coke, drinking.

695
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:57,279
This has gotta stop.
You promised me it was gonna stop!

696
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,975
- Get me the fuck...
- What are you doing?

697
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,448
- Brian, wait!
...out of here!

698
00:42:00,484 --> 00:42:01,508
Brian, wait!

699
00:42:01,585 --> 00:42:03,382
- What are you doing? No!
- Get the fuck away from me!

700
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,615
You can't leave. Brian, you're gonna...

701
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,347
Brian, where are you going?

702
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:11,451
- Mr. Reilly, where are you going?
- Mind your own fucking business!

703
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,894
This is AMA, Mr...

704
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,863
- I don't give a fuck what you call it!
- Mr. Reilly!

705
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:15,921
You sit down!

706
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:21,228
- Brian! Brian, wait!
- Just leave me alone!

707
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,373
You're gonna freeze. Hey! Somebody help.

708
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:26,875
He's barefoot!

709
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,104
Brian!

710
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:14,147
Matt, get him some clothes, all right?

711
00:43:15,993 --> 00:43:19,656
Get him some fucking clothes
before I fucking murder you!

712
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,597
Brian, get the fuck up!

713
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:25,032
What the fuck is this crazy shit?
Get the fuck up!

714
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,694
You're better than this, bro, all right?
Get up.

715
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,670
After all we been through,
you're gonna do this to me?

716
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,902
All right. Hey, you are stronger than this!
You look like shit.

717
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,637
- Get some... Where are the fucking clothes?
- Here. Here.

718
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,235
I don't ever want to see you again. All right?

719
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,678
I don't ever want to see you again!

720
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,347
You're so much better than this, all right?
Leave this shit alone.

721
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:48,018
This is what you're gonna do to us, huh?

722
00:43:49,093 --> 00:43:51,323
You're supposed to have my back.

723
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,699
Let's go home. Let's go home.
Let's go home.

724
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:11,510
What, you're just gonna sit there silent?
You're not gonna say a thing?

725
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:14,016
I mean, come on, Stacy.
I had a lot going on.

726
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:16,348
I haven't touched a thing in a week.

727
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,412
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>
<i>You're not gonna let me come home?</i>

728
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,953
I want to see my kids, Stacy.

729
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,054
I mean, how many times do I have to say
I'm sorry? I'm sorry.

730
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,597
<i>Sorry's not good enough anymore.</i>

731
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,532
I got nothing to say.
I gotta go pick up the kids.

732
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:40,738
All right.

733
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:45,106
How you doing? Stacy coming around?

734
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:49,448
I don't know. We're talking about
maybe going out to dinner. We'll see.

735
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,455
Anthony called me. He's got another one
of them truck scores lined up.

736
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,922
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

737
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:57,518
- I could sure use it.
- Can you drive one of them...

738
00:44:57,594 --> 00:44:58,788
- Five speeds?
- Yeah.

739
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:00,761
- Sure.
- All right.

740
00:45:00,798 --> 00:45:03,699
Hey, Mark.
You gonna throw that at me? Okay.

741
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:10,498
Not in the street. Not in the street.

742
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,333
- Hey. How you doing?
- Doing good.

743
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,478
See you later, okay? Give your dad a kiss.

744
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:22,917
I love you.

745
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:25,686
You ready?

746
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,116
Hey.

747
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:36,189
- So, what about dinner?
- Call me tomorrow.

748
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:47,905
- How much more room?
- I don't know. Looks good to me.

749
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:50,841
Here we go.

750
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,644
What'd I tell you? Piece of cake.

751
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,154
Nice. Nice. Yeah.

752
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,315
- Talk to you guys later.
- Thanks.

753
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:13,259
Oh, fuck.

754
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,172
Hey, turn him around.

755
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:21,239
Do you remember me?

756
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,678
How about now?

757
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,211
Get him out of here.

758
00:47:17,034 --> 00:47:20,902
- Hey, you Paulie McDougan?
- Yeah. Who are you?

759
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:24,532
Ronny Dents, from Dorchester.
You know Pat Kelly, right?

760
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:26,098
- Yeah.
- He'll be out in the yard at 1:00.

761
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,609
He wants to see you.

762
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:35,916
<i>Section 3 and 5,</i>
<i>"A" block on the yard in 15 minutes.</i>

763
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,221
<i>Section 3 and 5,</i>
<i>"A" block on the yard in 15 minutes.</i>

764
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:45,560
- That's Pat.
- I'll catch up.

765
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:47,652
Brian.

766
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,392
- Paulie.
- Hey, Pat.

767
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,095
- Small world.
- Yeah, yeah.

768
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,570
Five to seven, could be worse.

769
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,671
Come on. Let's walk.

770
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:04,978
- So, that's the thanks I get, huh?
- Pat...

771
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:08,449
Hey, look, I haven't lasted this long
by letting people fuck me.

772
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:11,715
The first chance you get,
you guys go out on your own.

773
00:48:11,788 --> 00:48:15,155
- It wasn't like that, Pat.
- That's exactly how it was.

774
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,660
You don't think I know
what's going on out there?

775
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:23,658
Come on.

776
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:27,868
I give people one chance,
and you just had yours.

777
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:30,168
Don't ever fuck me again.

778
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:34,239
I was pretty good to you two.

779
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,845
Let's put this shit behind us.

780
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,850
We watch each other's back in here.

781
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,523
- Fucking rat hole.
- It's good to see you, Pat.

782
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,553
It's good to see you, too.

783
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:52,725
I heard you two were coming in.

784
00:48:52,796 --> 00:48:55,731
Unfortunate, but I'm just glad to see you.

785
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:57,357
Yeah, you, too, Pat.

786
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,198
And, you, you still fucking
everything out there, huh?

787
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:04,104
- Prospects ain't so good right now.
- You're all done for a while.

788
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:07,133
- You got enough.
- You better be all done for a while.

789
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:09,508
Hey, sign up
for that alcoholics meeting later.

790
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:10,603
Okay, yeah, all right.

791
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:29,030
Hey, I'm Ray. I'm an alcoholic.
It's good to be here tonight.

792
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,191
And you remember when we first met,

793
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:31,598
I said, " Look, let's get the cigarette book,

794
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:33,135
"everything that helps the clock go fast."

795
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,670
- Yeah, right.
- Right, it kills time.

796
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:36,069
But then when we take the cash bets,

797
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,334
and they wanna bet
$500 or $1,000 a game, right,

798
00:49:38,408 --> 00:49:40,842
then they think they can give us
the old check-in-the-mail story.

799
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,106
Well, we cut them off.
Who needs the aggravation?

800
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:47,478
I'll see you back there.

801
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:51,855
...for the people in my network,
I'm able to stay sober one day at a time.

802
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:39,595
Thanks for coming.

803
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:43,932
Sure.

804
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:55,977
- You look good.
- Thanks.

805
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,453
- How are the boys?
- They're all right.

806
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:02,047
Mark wrote you some letters,
but they confiscated them.

807
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:06,989
How are you doing?

808
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,989
Considering I was just frisked,
I'm doing great.

809
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,591
Look, you gotta help me out
a little bit here, okay?

810
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,033
- Give you some help?
- Yeah.

811
00:51:13,103 --> 00:51:17,199
I know the situation that I put you in.
I feel bad about it, believe me.

812
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,299
But there's nothing I can do about that now.

813
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:21,276
If you want to move on, I'd understand.

814
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:23,244
Move on? Move on where?

815
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:28,248
Move on where? You got an option for me?

816
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,343
I'm just telling you it's okay. I'd understand.

817
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,411
I gotta raise your sons.

818
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:35,213
It's not like you were ever there.

819
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:38,159
Not like I was ever there. What,
you gonna start taking shots at me now?

820
00:51:38,228 --> 00:51:41,459
If it weren't for my father, we'd be homeless.

821
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:46,125
So what do you wanna do?

822
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,298
I don't know.

823
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,442
Do you still love me?

824
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:05,447
Do you ever find yourself
getting tired of all this?

825
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,717
What, doing time? Fuck yeah.

826
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:11,124
No, the whole thing, you know.
Just the grind.

827
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:16,859
Always chasing after a buck,
trying to be one step ahead of the cops.

828
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:19,493
We're just playing the cards we're dealt.

829
00:52:26,109 --> 00:52:27,940
I suck as a father.

830
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:29,906
What?

831
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:36,211
Brian, come on.
I mean, I'm not gonna shit you, all right.

832
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:39,881
You're not gonna win Father of the Year,
all right? You're not. It's over, you know.

833
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:43,050
But your kids love you. They do.

834
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:44,753
They got it better than we did, all right?
They do.

835
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:48,127
They got a good mom. They're good.
They love you.

836
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:51,133
- You really think they do?
- I know they do, all right?

837
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:54,227
Someday you're gonna
make all this up to them. All right?

838
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:57,762
Hey, hey, look at this guy up here. All right?
You see who I'm talking about?

839
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:02,540
He's doing 35 for an armored car, all right?
So, things could be worse.

840
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:04,739
Yeah, things could be worse.

841
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:34,702
<i>Prison is the most boring waste of time</i>
<i>you can imagine.</i>

842
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:37,542
<i>Yesterday is the same as tomorrow.</i>

843
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:41,573
<i>A bunch of cowards</i>
<i>hiding behind muscles and tattoos,</i>

844
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:45,087
<i>the most dangerous kind,</i>
<i>people filled with fear.</i>

845
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:51,119
<i>All I ever think about</i>
<i>is how I let you and the kids down.</i>

846
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:55,523
<i>I miss you. I'm sorry.</i>

847
00:53:57,367 --> 00:54:01,201
So I got that number to them guys
when you get out. They're good guys.

848
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,305
I drank away my wife.

849
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:06,001
It was hell, but that's what the booze does.

850
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:10,971
Jesus Christ, that's Danny Sullivan.
I haven't seen him in 15 years.

851
00:54:11,047 --> 00:54:13,515
Oh, yeah.
He was friends with my uncle, right?

852
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,881
Yeah, he was. He looks great.

853
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:18,211
Twenty years ago,
I was sitting right where you are.

854
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:19,721
Anyways, what else you got?

855
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,984
I was able to get a handle on it.

856
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:23,923
I was able to get
a little piece of my life back.

857
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:27,054
- Hey, you with us?
- Yeah, yeah.

858
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,827
Once again, my name is Dan.
I'm an alcoholic. Thanks for letting me talk.

859
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:34,698
All right, everybody back to the block!

860
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:41,203
Hey, Sully. I'm Brian Reilly.
I met you when I was a little kid.

861
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:45,847
Bobby's nephew. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
He was a good man.

862
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,777
Yeah, he was. Thanks.

863
00:54:49,552 --> 00:54:52,487
So, you hear anything that made sense?

864
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:55,147
Yeah. A few things, yeah.

865
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:57,384
How much time you got left?

866
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:00,554
- Just a couple weeks and I'm out.
- Good, good.

867
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:02,757
You planning on staying sober?

868
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:09,035
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- You got any meetings lined up?

869
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:11,733
I've never been to a meeting
before I come in here,

870
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,504
and that was just to get off the block.

871
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,568
If you ever want to go to a meeting
or just talk,

872
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,511
- give me a call.
- All right, Brian, let's go. Time to go back.

873
00:55:18,581 --> 00:55:20,105
Just one minute.

874
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:24,585
- All right. Thanks, Sully.
- You bet.

875
00:55:30,226 --> 00:55:31,625
Hey, Paulie.

876
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:34,858
Remember that scumbag child molester
we saw on TV last week?

877
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:37,195
- Yeah.
- I'm putting him in cell 12.

878
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,331
Thanks, Callahan.

879
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:07,224
Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go! Let's do it.

880
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:10,188
What the fuck?

881
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,161
Come here a second. Come here.

882
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:17,696
You fucking...
You take the pain, you fucking freak.

883
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:22,409
You like fucking kids?
You fucking rape fucking kids!

884
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:25,605
What's wrong with you? Come on, come on.

885
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:44,428
You eat like a fucking animal.

886
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,264
Don't start, Paulie.

887
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:50,296
Here they are.

888
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:54,203
All right, let's go.

889
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,511
- Enjoy yourself.
- Thanks.

890
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,479
Eat however you want.

891
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,775
How you doing?

892
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:01,147
<i>All right, let's get right to it.</i>

893
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:05,443
We all know you did it.
Personally, I don't give a shit,

894
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:08,719
but Sergeant Callahan may lose his job.
He's already been suspended.

895
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:13,320
I know he's been good to you two,
newspapers, privileges, whatnot.

896
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:16,456
I got the D.A. all over my ass on this one.

897
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,694
As sick as these bastards are,
they're protected.

898
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:22,534
- What are you looking for?
- Well, if somebody came forward,

899
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:27,042
we could make this go away
and save everyone a lot of aggravation.

900
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,511
Callahan's a good man.

901
00:57:30,647 --> 00:57:31,807
So what are we looking at?

902
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:35,009
Six more months or 90 days in the hole.

903
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:36,608
It was me.

904
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:37,744
- What?
- Just you?

905
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:38,913
- Yeah, just me.
- Wait a second.

906
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:40,922
- Come on. You'd do the same for me.
- You don't have to do that.

907
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:42,184
- Say hi to the boys.
- Paul.

908
00:57:42,258 --> 00:57:43,691
- Just you?
- Just me.

909
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:47,594
It's the right thing, Brian.
Come on, you'd do the same thing.

910
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:53,492
What, so the boys, they didn't wanna come?

911
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,539
No, they wanted to. Mark's still sick.

912
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:02,436
Sean'll come around.
You're gonna have to work on it though.

913
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:03,668
So...

914
00:58:05,849 --> 00:58:07,908
What do you plan on doing?

915
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:10,013
I'm not sure yet.

916
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,746
- You're gonna get a job, right?
- Yeah, I'm gonna get something,

917
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:16,588
but first I want to just spend some time
with you and the kids.

918
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,127
Stacy, take a good look around here

919
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:25,395
'cause I will never ever put you and the boys
in this situation again.

920
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:31,131
You'll never see me like this again, ever.
I promise you.

921
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:50,289
Hey, Callahan.
So this is where they got you.

922
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,225
Yeah, well, it could've
been a lot worse, huh?

923
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:55,924
Yeah. I appreciate everything you did for us.
You're all right, Callahan.

924
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:58,524
- Take care out there, Brian.
- Thanks.

925
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,323
Hey, buddy!

926
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:40,934
I missed you. Let me see. Let me see you.

927
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:43,799
Give me a look. Hey, where's your brother?

928
01:00:43,873 --> 01:00:45,465
- He went to go meet his girlfriend.
- He'll be home later.

929
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:46,906
He did? Do you have any girlfriends?

930
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:50,070
- I have two, actually.
- Not bad, not bad.

931
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,007
- Hey, Katie.
- Hey.

932
01:00:52,181 --> 01:00:53,808
- How've you been?
- Good. Welcome back.

933
01:00:53,883 --> 01:00:55,475
Good to see you.

934
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,947
Thanks for watching them for us.

935
01:01:01,891 --> 01:01:03,688
Your brother went to see
his girlfriend, huh?

936
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,092
Yeah, he'll be back later though.

937
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,925
What happened to Coynes Tavern?

938
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,693
They made it into condos two years ago.

939
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:15,497
All these yuppies are moving in buying up
everything. Rents are unbelievable.

940
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,805
Everything's changing.

941
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:21,239
So now you gotta be rich
to live in South Boston.

942
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,273
So we are.

943
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:28,706
Mark told me you have a girlfriend.

944
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:33,211
- Yeah? Is she pretty?
- Very pretty.

945
01:01:33,456 --> 01:01:35,219
This is pretty good.

946
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:38,657
- Pretty good?
- Yeah, pretty good.

947
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:42,729
- What's her name?
- Stephanie.

948
01:01:43,499 --> 01:01:45,660
I'd like to meet her sometime.

949
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:51,372
I gotta go. I'll see you later.

950
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,406
- You don't wanna finish?
- No.

951
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:57,502
Not too late, Sean. Sean?

952
01:01:57,847 --> 01:02:00,247
All right, I'll see you, buddy.

953
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:19,225
Wow.

954
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:24,665
You don't have to say that.

955
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:06,179
Oh, my God.

956
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:14,548
Come on, you're gonna be late,
and your ma is gonna kill me.

957
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,888
- I miss you, man.
- All right. Bye.

958
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,689
All right. I put a cupcake in your lunch.

959
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:22,296
All right. Thanks, Dad. Bye.

960
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,992
I love you, Mark.

961
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,892
I love you, too.

962
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:32,904
What?

963
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,136
What are you banging on the door
like you're the cops for?

964
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:38,669
- Do you know you're $600 overdue?
- Yeah, I do now.

965
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,715
We sent you three notices,
so unless you make a payment...

966
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:42,944
Hey, you seem to be
taking this pretty personal.

967
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,543
What, is the money
coming out of your own pocket?

968
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,678
Just doing my job.

969
01:03:45,755 --> 01:03:48,622
Well, some people don't have a job
that pays 52 checks a year.

970
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:49,680
Oh, I'm sorry.

971
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,421
Listen, you either pay the money,
or I'm gonna have to shut your gas off.

972
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,484
Hey.

973
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:56,922
- You ain't shutting off a fucking thing.
- Relax.

974
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,024
Now, you get back in your little truck,
and you drive away

975
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:00,864
before I bash your fucking head in.

976
01:04:00,903 --> 01:04:03,201
- Take it easy, okay?
- No, no. Get going.

977
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:06,730
Call the cops. Do what you have to do.
I'll find you.

978
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,610
Hey, hey. Wait a second.

979
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,979
Now look what you got me doing
in front of my wife.

980
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:18,111
Now, shake my hand,
and smile at her like everything's all right.

981
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,453
Give her a little wave.

982
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:24,425
Now, write down on a piece of paper
where I can make a payment.

983
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:26,086
Okay.

984
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:28,590
Thanks. Have a nice day.

985
01:04:31,133 --> 01:04:34,159
He gave me a number
where I can make a payment.

986
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:38,037
- I can't ask my father for no more money.
- I'll see what I can do.

987
01:04:38,107 --> 01:04:40,007
You mean like a job?

988
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:43,335
I only been out for two days.
I need you to give me a chance.

989
01:04:43,412 --> 01:04:45,403
No, no, no. I just meant, you know...

990
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:46,470
- What?
- Never mind.

991
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,786
- Hey.
- Look who it is.

992
01:04:57,493 --> 01:04:59,154
- All right.
- Good to see you.

993
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:00,251
You, too, Jackie.

994
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:02,059
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

995
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:04,725
- Look at you. You lost a bundle of weight.
- Yeah, I did.

996
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,324
How does it feel to be home?

997
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,893
- Different.
- Yeah, yeah, I know that feeling.

998
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:10,871
So Pat said there was an envelope for me.

999
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,534
- I got it right here. Hold on.
- Thanks, Jackie.

1000
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:15,600
So, you want a drink?
Maybe something to eat?

1001
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:17,771
No, no, no. I'm all right.

1002
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,648
- You've been staying in shape, huh?
- You know, hitting the bag a little.

1003
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:22,809
- Attaboy.
- Thanks.

1004
01:05:22,885 --> 01:05:24,079
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1005
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:25,142
All right.

1006
01:05:29,892 --> 01:05:32,793
Come on, have a seat.
Have something to eat.

1007
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:40,000
- Sit down, relax.
- I'm okay, Jackie.

1008
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:45,505
- Hey, listen, I got a few things to do.
- All right.

1009
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:47,336
Thanks.

1010
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:51,846
- All right. Hey, good to see you, Brian.
- I'll be seeing you soon, Jackie.

1011
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:56,751
I got the pizza. Here you go.

1012
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:58,150
- Yes, pizza!
- Nice.

1013
01:05:58,220 --> 01:05:59,983
Here you go. Dig in.

1014
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,450
Pay the gas bill. Pay it.

1015
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:06,918
- Where did you get this?
- I went down to see Jackie about a job.

1016
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:09,091
He lent me a few bucks.

1017
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:11,156
Come on, dig in. What are you waiting for?

1018
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:13,994
- Hey, Sean, how you doing, buddy?
- Pretty good.

1019
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:17,528
All right, listen, Stace,
he gave me a two-word answer!

1020
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:19,497
I'll get it.

1021
01:06:20,376 --> 01:06:21,775
How is that?

1022
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:23,872
Brian!

1023
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:25,978
What's up?

1024
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:35,385
Go be with the kids.

1025
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:43,998
What? What's going on?

1026
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,401
I just came by to welcome you back
to the neighborhood.

1027
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:48,596
You got a warrant?

1028
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,798
Why? You do something wrong?

1029
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:53,771
Yeah, okay. Could you step outside, please?

1030
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:55,370
Thanks.

1031
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,375
Don't come in my house without a reason.

1032
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:04,112
Like I said, I just came to welcome you back.

1033
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,778
Cute. I got it.

1034
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:10,555
Hey, Jackie, did you talk to that guy?

1035
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:14,255
<i>He says nothing's open right now.</i>
<i>Hey, maybe in a month or two.</i>

1036
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,991
All right, thanks.

1037
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,291
Any luck?

1038
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,801
Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna go see him right now.

1039
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:21,859
- Right now?
- Yeah.

1040
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:23,272
All right.

1041
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:48,161
Hey, Brian. How you doing?

1042
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,255
- I'm all right. What's your name?
- Dave.

1043
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:53,233
My little brother plays baseball
with your son, Sean. He's a good player.

1044
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:54,735
Yeah, thanks.

1045
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:57,934
- You work for the city?
- Yeah.

1046
01:07:58,174 --> 01:07:59,505
How's that?

1047
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:01,405
- Not bad.
- How do you get a job like that?

1048
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:04,306
- You remember Jimmy Kelly, right?
- Yeah.

1049
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:08,578
He got me the job. Otherwise I'd have
to wait in line with 40,000 other people.

1050
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,216
There's the boss. All right.

1051
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:15,080
I gotta go buy him lunch
to get him off my back.

1052
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,883
Have a good day.

1053
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:24,525
And that's my story
of how I ended up at these meetings.

1054
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:27,892
I'd like to thank you
for letting me speak tonight.

1055
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:32,331
And I'd like to end this meeting,
as we do all of them,

1056
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:34,699
with the Lord's Prayer, please.

1057
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:39,464
And in the name of the Father
and of the Son

1058
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:41,874
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

1059
01:09:42,144 --> 01:09:45,409
"Our Father who art in Heaven
Hallowed be thy name"

1060
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:56,550
- All that praying and stuff threw me.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

1061
01:09:57,726 --> 01:10:00,524
I felt the same way when I first came around.

1062
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:04,862
I want you to trust me on this.
For now, you just show up with me.

1063
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:07,195
If you have trouble
sitting through a meeting,

1064
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:10,102
you just remember where you were.

1065
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:15,403
That always helped me. Come on.
I'll give you a ride home.

1066
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:17,678
Now, I'm gonna try to find you some work.

1067
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:29,285
Excuse me. You Jerry?

1068
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:31,656
- Yeah. How you doing?
- My name's Brian.

1069
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,558
Sully might have called you
about some work.

1070
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:36,029
Brian. Oh, Brian, yeah, yeah.
Sully called me.

1071
01:10:36,098 --> 01:10:37,725
- How are you doing? You all right?
- I'm good. Yeah.

1072
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,098
- Yeah. You looking for a little work?
- Yeah, you got something?

1073
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:41,193
Okay.

1074
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,965
Yeah, well, you know,
you see what we got here.

1075
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:45,472
Not much,
but, you know, we can keep you busy.

1076
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:48,601
- That'll work for me.
- All right, let me get the card.

1077
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:50,577
- Here's a card. Here you go.
- Yeah.

1078
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:52,614
You give me a call, we'll do what we can.
All right, brother?

1079
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:54,808
- I appreciate it. I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay. You got it.

1080
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:56,612
Hut one, hut two. Hike!

1081
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:58,346
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,

1082
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,912
three Mississippi, four Mississippi,
five Mississippi.

1083
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:04,617
Yeah.

1084
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:46,226
Hello?

1085
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:50,432
<i>Hi, this is Sister Flora from Saint Brigitte's.</i>
<i>Is this Mr. Reilly?</i>

1086
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:52,039
Yes, Sister.

1087
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:55,167
<i>Mr. Reilly, I'm calling</i>
<i>in regards to Mark's tuition.</i>

1088
01:11:55,244 --> 01:11:57,576
<i>As of now, you're three payments behind.</i>

1089
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,773
Yes, Sister, I realize that.

1090
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:04,211
I'm just starting a new job here,
so we've just been playing catch-up.

1091
01:12:04,286 --> 01:12:07,414
<i>We're well aware of your situation,</i>
<i>Mr. Reilly,</i>

1092
01:12:07,489 --> 01:12:11,391
<i>but we need to bring this to your attention</i>
<i>before the school year ends.</i>

1093
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:14,088
Okay. I realize that, Sister, but...

1094
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:17,195
I'll take care of it, okay?

1095
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:18,790
<i>Very good. God bless you.</i>

1096
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:20,357
Yeah, you, too.

1097
01:12:28,977 --> 01:12:32,708
- Hey, Jerry, what's up?
- Brian, I tried to catch you at home.

1098
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:35,875
I got nothing for you today.
Call me tomorrow.

1099
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:40,715
Okay. All right.

1100
01:12:47,396 --> 01:12:49,660
Hey, Freddie. Freddie, how you doing?

1101
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:51,757
- How's it going?
- Hey, good to see you. Good to see you.

1102
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:52,823
Yeah.

1103
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:57,027
- Hey, what's that? You gotta kill the ball!
- Hey!

1104
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:59,664
- How you doing? Welcome back.
- Good.

1105
01:12:59,775 --> 01:13:01,800
- So can I step in?
- Come on in.

1106
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:03,903
- Hey, who's your partner?
- Vinnie and Kevin.

1107
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:06,004
Kevin. Hey, how you doing? Can I step in?

1108
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:07,275
- Yeah.
- Yeah, take a rest.

1109
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:09,249
- Hey, Paulie.
- Joe Biggs. How are you?

1110
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:12,776
Hey, Tony! Put $100 on us, all right?
I just got out of handball school.

1111
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:14,720
It's a safe bet. All right.

1112
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:19,822
All right. Serve it up, let's go!

1113
01:13:19,895 --> 01:13:20,884
All right.

1114
01:13:22,131 --> 01:13:25,828
Can you believe that prick Pat, huh?
$500, he gives us.

1115
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:28,165
I couldn't believe it, either.

1116
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:30,668
What about Stacy and the kids? They good?

1117
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:32,502
They're good, yeah.

1118
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:35,776
How about money, huh? You making any?

1119
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:39,541
Yeah, you know,
picking up some stuff here and there,

1120
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:41,845
just spending time with the kids,
trying to do the right thing.

1121
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:44,283
It's tough out here, you know?

1122
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:49,213
- It's good to be out though, you know?
- Yeah.

1123
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:51,753
It'd be a lot nicer with money.

1124
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:01,791
- Hey, Paulie! When'd you get out, huh?
- You forget about me?

1125
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:04,634
- No. How could I forget about you, Paulie?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1126
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:06,573
So you got my money then?

1127
01:14:06,642 --> 01:14:10,408
Well, not right now,
but give me a couple of months and...

1128
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:12,674
A couple of months? You greedy prick!

1129
01:14:12,748 --> 01:14:16,411
I've been down for five years,
and you haven't sent me a fucking dime!

1130
01:14:16,485 --> 01:14:18,919
I'm gonna go outside,
and I'm gonna count to 20,

1131
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:23,048
and when I come back in,
there's gonna be two grand on this counter.

1132
01:14:31,533 --> 01:14:35,367
Do yourself a favor, Burt,
throw some cash up on that counter.

1133
01:14:45,414 --> 01:14:46,608
- How we doing?
- Here, here, here.

1134
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:48,047
Yeah. Hey.

1135
01:14:50,686 --> 01:14:52,153
Hey, see you.

1136
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:56,480
What the fuck, Paul?
You haven't even changed your clothes yet.

1137
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:58,617
- Relax.
- He's a cheap prick.

1138
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:02,094
What are we gonna do, starve out here?
Let's go see the kids.

1139
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:07,100
- Fucking crazy.
- How do you like this car?

1140
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:11,405
- What do you think?
- I don't know. I don't know.

1141
01:15:11,473 --> 01:15:13,941
- She didn't know that he was married.
- Hi, Stacy.

1142
01:15:14,009 --> 01:15:16,000
- Paulie!
- How are you doing?

1143
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:19,013
- When did you get out?
- A couple hours ago.

1144
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:20,639
- Oh, yeah? You look good.
- Thanks, doll.

1145
01:15:20,716 --> 01:15:23,184
- How you been?
- Okay. I'm okay now.

1146
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:26,415
- How you doing? You look good.
- Hey, Paulie, they let you out, huh?

1147
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:29,355
Nice to see you, too, Katie.
You're still single, I bet.

1148
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:30,891
- Oh, yeah. Fuck you, Paulie.
- Come on, give me a kiss.

1149
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:32,119
- Mark.
- Mark.

1150
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,162
- Coming, Dad.
- Come here.

1151
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:37,298
This is Mark.

1152
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:40,293
- That's not Mark. That's Mark?
- Yeah, that's Mark.

1153
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:42,496
- Look at the fucking size of this kid.
- Hey, wait! The F-bomb!

1154
01:15:42,571 --> 01:15:43,595
No, no, no!

1155
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:46,038
- What a football player you're gonna be.
- Baseball.

1156
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:47,939
- Baseball.
- You remember your Uncle Paul?

1157
01:15:48,010 --> 01:15:49,910
- Yeah. He got me my first football.
- Supper's ready.

1158
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:51,878
That's right.
That's right, I got him his first football.

1159
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:54,814
Oh, no. You know, we're heading right out.
I gotta get Paulie situated.

1160
01:15:54,883 --> 01:15:57,579
You don't want a burger? I'll have a burger.

1161
01:15:57,653 --> 01:15:58,813
- You got...
- Just grab one.

1162
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:00,286
- Wait.
- I can cook up another one.

1163
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:02,153
- Just have him put a top on one.
- Yeah...

1164
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,692
Can I grab this one? Pretty good.

1165
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:05,988
- Yeah, help yourself.
- Thank you.

1166
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,551
Mark, wash your hands.

1167
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:08,891
- You want to come with us, Mark?
- Okay.

1168
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:10,329
I'm just kidding.

1169
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,469
- Chivas on the rocks.
- Can I get a soda water?

1170
01:16:15,537 --> 01:16:18,973
- What's with the soda water?
- I'm taking it easy.

1171
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:21,740
Well, what do you think?

1172
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:26,270
I don't know. I don't like anything
that Jackie and Pat are behind lately.

1173
01:16:26,348 --> 01:16:29,875
Thanks. Me, neither,
but let's just hear them out, all right?

1174
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:32,819
Hey, boys, this is Eddie.
He'll give you all the details.

1175
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:36,221
Hey, there. You want a drink?
You want a drink?

1176
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:39,419
- No, I'm good, thanks.
- Yeah, all right. Okay.

1177
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:42,019
- Sully came by last night.
- Oh, yeah?

1178
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,292
I'll give him a call later.

1179
01:16:49,471 --> 01:16:52,702
- What's this?
- I left you a few bucks.

1180
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:55,004
- Where did you get it?
- Come on.

1181
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:57,341
What, are you gonna question
every dollar I give you?

1182
01:16:57,412 --> 01:17:00,848
You're like a fucking parole officer.
Relax, will you?

1183
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,678
I gotta go.

1184
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:08,817
Tell me again,
how much money is in that safe?

1185
01:17:08,890 --> 01:17:10,380
- Forty grand.
- Forty grand.

1186
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,450
- And that's definitely him?
- Yeah, that's definitely him.

1187
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:15,985
- I'd know that fat fuck anywhere.
- All right, let's do it.

1188
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:27,231
Get in the truck, you fat fuck,
before I put a hole in you.

1189
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:28,640
Get in the fucking truck!

1190
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:30,940
Open the fucking door. Get in.
We're going to your house.

1191
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:32,139
We're gonna clean out your safe. Get in!

1192
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:59,167
Wave to them kids.

1193
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:00,875
There you go.

1194
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:04,742
Paulie, I don't know what to tell you.

1195
01:18:04,813 --> 01:18:06,371
There was supposed to be
40 grand in the box.

1196
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:07,642
- Shut the fuck up!
- What's the matter?

1197
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,581
- What happened?
- 2,700 fucking dollars.

1198
01:18:09,651 --> 01:18:11,209
That's it?
Eddie, what the fuck's going on here?

1199
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:13,117
Jackie, I know, there was supposed to be
40 grand in the box.

1200
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:14,587
- Hey, Eddie, you guaran-fucking-teed it!
- I know.

1201
01:18:14,656 --> 01:18:18,422
Hey, here's your $700, all right?
We're keeping the rest.

1202
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:20,893
Broad fucking daylight, Jackie,

1203
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:25,189
and, for the record, we are done
risking our asses for you and Pat.

1204
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:27,167
- You can both go fuck yourselves.
- Is that right, Paulie?

1205
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:30,432
- Yeah, that's right!
- Hey, what do I get, Paulie?

1206
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:43,949
Here, pay the tuition.

1207
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:48,083
What is this? What is this?
You just don't get it, do you?

1208
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,715
- I am not paying any bills with that money!
- What do you want from me?

1209
01:18:50,792 --> 01:18:52,623
- What the fuck do you want from me?
- Do you think I'm stupid?

1210
01:18:52,694 --> 01:18:53,991
- When are you gonna realize...
- What? Shut up!

1211
01:18:54,062 --> 01:18:56,257
God damn it!
Do you think 'cause I'm sober...

1212
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:58,023
- Do you think 'cause I'm...
- You just...

1213
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:01,968
Do you think 'cause I'm sober,
they're gonna start sending me envelopes?

1214
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:04,835
- When are you gonna listen to me?
- Get off me!

1215
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:06,396
- You better listen to me!
- What do you want me to say?

1216
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,943
When are you gonna realize
your kids need a father!

1217
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:11,740
This is who I am! It's who I am!

1218
01:19:11,813 --> 01:19:13,644
Yeah, go ahead, run.
That's what you do best.

1219
01:19:13,715 --> 01:19:15,706
- It's who I am!
- Slam the door, too!

1220
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:18,150
Yeah, that's it. Go ahead.

1221
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:31,257
- What? I think I'm in love.
- Oh, really?

1222
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:34,191
I've known you what, eight, nine minutes?

1223
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,100
- So? Don't you want to...
- So?

1224
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:40,130
- Nicole, don't go there. Don't go there.
- What? What's wrong? We're just talking.

1225
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:44,668
You're a young girl.
Do not go falling for a guy like me.

1226
01:19:44,746 --> 01:19:46,714
- It's not...
- I like bad boys.

1227
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,182
Yeah, you're too young
to know what you like, all right?

1228
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:52,982
And all that bad-boy stuff,
that's great, real exciting.

1229
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:54,817
You got some good stories
to tell your friends,

1230
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:58,451
and then you end up curled up in a ball
when they leave you.

1231
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,828
- Is that what you think?
- Drop it, Nicole.

1232
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:03,364
We're just hanging out.
I'm having a great time,

1233
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:06,764
but if that don't work for you,
then you gotta tell me.

1234
01:20:06,835 --> 01:20:08,166
All right?

1235
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:20,180
You know what? I just remembered,
I got some place I gotta be.

1236
01:20:22,684 --> 01:20:24,447
I get it. I'll go.

1237
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:46,303
Where were you?
I waited for you, and then I just...

1238
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:48,501
I know. Yeah, I got tied up.

1239
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:55,478
I know what we can do,
because I'm done with this bullshit.

1240
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:57,450
Oh, yeah? What's that?

1241
01:20:57,919 --> 01:21:00,285
I clocked an armored truck today.

1242
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:02,417
- Brian.
- Come on.

1243
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:05,685
What? Every time I mention it to you,
you say it's impossible.

1244
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,784
Everyone gets caught.

1245
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,159
That's 'cause they're all high on junk,
all right?

1246
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:09,663
They got wet brain.
We're gonna do it different.

1247
01:21:09,731 --> 01:21:11,596
- Come on, will you, Paul?
- I'm not fucking around, Brian.

1248
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:14,863
Okay? No, I'm done with this grind.
What are we gonna do? Get a job, huh?

1249
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:18,337
It's like standing in mud.
30 years go by, and you're dead.

1250
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:20,237
You wanna live like that?

1251
01:21:20,308 --> 01:21:24,005
All I'm asking is check it out.
If we don't like it, we walk.

1252
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:29,379
How's it going, guys?

1253
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:31,510
I see you're out getting some exercise.

1254
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:33,383
- Is that a crime?
- No.

1255
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:35,512
Robbing someone at gunpoint is.

1256
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:38,388
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yeah, I'm sure you don't.

1257
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:40,985
Good thing for you two,
the fat man didn't flip.

1258
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:43,758
But don't worry, they all do eventually.
Just ask Pat.

1259
01:21:43,832 --> 01:21:45,299
- Okay.
- Brian.

1260
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,827
Can I ask you a question?

1261
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:52,363
I'm out here, I'm trying to do the right thing,
and everywhere I go, you're all over me.

1262
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,704
So what's it gonna take?
When are you gonna let that go?

1263
01:21:54,776 --> 01:21:55,834
It was five years ago.

1264
01:21:55,911 --> 01:22:00,575
How about you toss me a beating
for an hour or two, and then we call it even.

1265
01:22:09,157 --> 01:22:11,751
You see what I'm talking about, huh?

1266
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:15,626
We're gonna be dodging pricks like that
for the rest of our lives.

1267
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:20,995
Alls we need is a little bit of padding,
and then we can do whatever we want.

1268
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:30,438
What do you think?

1269
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:36,049
- Aren't there usually three?
- Yeah, that's why it's perfect.

1270
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:39,553
All we have to do is get one of them,
and we own them.

1271
01:22:42,324 --> 01:22:43,518
- What?
- I don't know, Paulie.

1272
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:47,083
- What?
- This is some cowboy shit, man.

1273
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:49,794
No. I know we can pull this off.

1274
01:22:58,073 --> 01:22:59,404
Let's go.

1275
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:18,756
This is the spot.

1276
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:21,990
All right, we got three exits.
It's their last stop.

1277
01:23:22,063 --> 01:23:24,691
They'll be fully loaded. This is it.

1278
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:30,126
You all right?

1279
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:33,263
Look, Brian,

1280
01:23:33,775 --> 01:23:37,802
if you don't wanna do it, I'll understand.
I'll get another guy.

1281
01:23:37,879 --> 01:23:39,506
I need the money.

1282
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:44,584
Well, it's your call.

1283
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,225
Hey, buddy.

1284
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:55,151
- Hey.
- Is Ma home?

1285
01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:57,160
She went for a walk.

1286
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:10,841
Sorry about the blow up with Ma last week.

1287
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:14,641
I just been having a...

1288
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:18,312
I've just been having a tough time adjusting.

1289
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:28,629
We haven't talked much.

1290
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:34,232
I been trying to give you a little time.

1291
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:40,867
You got every right to be mad.
I just don't want you to hate me.

1292
01:24:40,942 --> 01:24:43,536
I don't hate you. You're my father.

1293
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:53,882
Sean, I'm really proud of you
and the way you carry yourself

1294
01:24:53,955 --> 01:24:58,858
and what you've done in school
and with your life, and...

1295
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:05,664
Sean, I guess I just wanna know
what it's gonna take

1296
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:09,635
to get you to respect me
the way that I respect you.

1297
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:18,945
Just stop drinking and don't leave us.

1298
01:25:29,691 --> 01:25:31,420
Yeah, yeah, just...

1299
01:25:35,763 --> 01:25:37,390
What's up, Sean?

1300
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:01,854
Anyway, so I'll pop out, right?
I get the drop on them.

1301
01:26:01,923 --> 01:26:03,220
- And what do you do?
- Pop the trunk.

1302
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:05,282
Pop the trunk. Boom, there it is.

1303
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:07,660
What's this?

1304
01:26:11,266 --> 01:26:12,426
Hold on a second.

1305
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:26,306
- How you doing?
- Hey, Sully.

1306
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:28,042
I haven't heard from you.

1307
01:26:28,116 --> 01:26:31,085
Yeah, me and Stacy had a beef,
so I've been staying with Paul.

1308
01:26:31,152 --> 01:26:33,143
Yeah, yeah, she called me.

1309
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:36,247
- She called you? For what?
- She's worried.

1310
01:26:39,093 --> 01:26:41,789
Sorry about that. She's paranoid.

1311
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:46,296
- You been using?
- No.

1312
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:52,062
She told me you're out making money.

1313
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:55,599
I'm fucking broke. Making money?

1314
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:01,973
You wanna go back to prison
and abandon your kids again?

1315
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,575
'Cause that's where you're gonna go.

1316
01:27:06,754 --> 01:27:09,222
Keep going down the same road,
you end up in the same place.

1317
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:12,919
- Yeah, well, maybe that's where I belong.
- Is that what you want?

1318
01:27:13,161 --> 01:27:17,860
The easy way out? Prison,
three squares a day, no responsibilities?

1319
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:22,363
Funny, you didn't strike me as a quitter.

1320
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,336
I can't make it out here.

1321
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:36,278
You know, I sit in that...

1322
01:27:38,353 --> 01:27:42,187
Sit in that cell with
all these hopes and dreams of my life,

1323
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:45,758
and it's fucking bullshit.

1324
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:50,594
Who am I kidding? It's impossible for me.

1325
01:27:54,168 --> 01:27:57,433
And nobody loves their kids more than I do.
Nobody.

1326
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:02,936
But I look at them, I see nothing but victims.
My victims.

1327
01:28:05,747 --> 01:28:08,375
I can't give them anything, nothing,

1328
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:10,710
let alone what they deserve.

1329
01:28:13,187 --> 01:28:14,176
Just...

1330
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:22,828
It's okay. Go ahead. Let it out.

1331
01:28:24,532 --> 01:28:27,467
It took me 50 years to learn real men cry.

1332
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:37,174
Today Sean asked me to stay sober
and not ever go away again.

1333
01:28:37,412 --> 01:28:38,401
Man...

1334
01:28:39,547 --> 01:28:44,041
It scared the fuck out of me because
I don't think it's anything that I can do.

1335
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:46,086
A day at a time, you can.

1336
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:50,050
I'll tell you something,
they'd be better off without me, really.

1337
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:51,489
They would.

1338
01:28:51,726 --> 01:28:55,093
I just screw everything up
when I come around, anyway.

1339
01:29:45,847 --> 01:29:47,371
Let's do it. Fuck this.

1340
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:02,594
Get down! Get down!

1341
01:30:02,663 --> 01:30:05,461
- Get down! Get down!
- Get your hands up.

1342
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:07,023
There you go.

1343
01:30:07,135 --> 01:30:09,831
- Fuck!
- Nice and easy. Nobody gets hurt.

1344
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:12,696
We don't need any heroes.

1345
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:15,599
Police! Freeze!

1346
01:30:16,978 --> 01:30:18,275
- Freeze!
- Let's go!

1347
01:30:18,346 --> 01:30:20,177
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1348
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:28,453
- Let's go!
- Drop your weapon! Now! I said now!

1349
01:30:28,623 --> 01:30:30,716
What are you doing? Get in!

1350
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:33,259
- Get in the car!
- Let's go! Move!

1351
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:35,690
Go, go, go, go!

1352
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:34,110
Shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit.

1353
01:31:35,289 --> 01:31:36,483
Where you been?

1354
01:31:36,557 --> 01:31:39,185
- I went for a walk.
- Yeah? You hungry?

1355
01:31:39,260 --> 01:31:40,454
Thanks.

1356
01:31:43,231 --> 01:31:46,200
This chick I've been seeing is making
these unbelievable pancakes, all right?

1357
01:31:46,267 --> 01:31:49,703
You're gonna want one of these suckers.
All right.

1358
01:31:57,812 --> 01:31:59,837
What's up? You all right?

1359
01:32:03,885 --> 01:32:04,977
Yeah.

1360
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:11,121
I don't know what,
she taught me a little something, but...

1361
01:32:12,126 --> 01:32:14,094
These fucking things are good.

1362
01:32:18,733 --> 01:32:20,098
What's up?

1363
01:32:25,907 --> 01:32:26,965
I...

1364
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:40,817
I can't go, Paulie.

1365
01:32:41,322 --> 01:32:43,722
I gotta take a pass for my boys.

1366
01:32:46,894 --> 01:32:49,624
Don't worry, all right? I seen it coming.

1367
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:53,794
You know, I got a guy ready.
But I gotta tell you something.

1368
01:32:56,170 --> 01:33:00,869
I'm getting away with it.
There's not a doubt in my mind.

1369
01:33:02,310 --> 01:33:05,677
I'm retiring on this one.
I'm not going back to prison for no one.

1370
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:07,509
You can bet on that.

1371
01:33:07,949 --> 01:33:11,476
I guess there's no chance
I could talk you out of it then.

1372
01:33:14,288 --> 01:33:16,586
It's not gonna be the same.

1373
01:33:17,725 --> 01:33:19,955
- I understand, Brian.
- Paul.

1374
01:33:20,828 --> 01:33:23,820
Come on, you got kids. It's good. It's good.

1375
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:28,663
Come on.

1376
01:33:33,174 --> 01:33:35,165
I understand, all right.

1377
01:33:43,017 --> 01:33:47,113
<i>Topping today's news, a brazen</i>
<i>broad-daylight armored-car robbery.</i>

1378
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:51,420
<i>A shootout erupted after three men</i>
<i>robbed a South Shore mall this morning,</i>

1379
01:33:51,492 --> 01:33:53,960
<i>getting away</i>
<i>with an undetermined amount of cash.</i>

1380
01:33:54,028 --> 01:33:57,088
<i>A wounded guard was transported</i>
<i>to Boston City Hospital.</i>

1381
01:33:57,164 --> 01:33:58,756
<i>His condition is unknown.</i>

1382
01:35:17,211 --> 01:35:18,473
Good job.
