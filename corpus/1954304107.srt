1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,160
So far, on this artistic journey
through the Dark Ages


2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,800
we have been hugging the
Mediterranean and following the sun.


3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,080
But the Dark Ages wouldn't be
as significant as they were


4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,920
in the story of art
if they had stayed in the south.


5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,440
To be properly influential,
they needed also to venture north.


6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,240
This is Lindisfarne, high up
on the north coast of Britain.


7
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,320
Holy Island they call it.


8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,000
And this monastery you see there
was founded


9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,360
early in the seventh century by
an Irish monk called Aidan.


10
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,720
What a place to
build a monastery, eh?


11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,640
Cut off from the mainland,
beaten up by the sea.


12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,840
It's so out of the way
and impractical


13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,920
and that's precisely
why it was chosen.


14
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,480
The Irish monks who founded
Lindisfarne weren't


15
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:27,200
looking for an easy life, they were
looking for difficulties to conquer.


16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,720
These were hard-core northern
Christians who had isolated


17
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,960
themselves up here on purpose,
who worked their fingers to


18
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,600
the bone and created something
out of nothing.


19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,200
As they saw it, Jesus had
sacrificed his life for them


20
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,880
so the least they could do was
sacrifice their comfort.


21
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,120
The hard-core determination
of the Lindisfarne monks shows not


22
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,880
only in the miraculous
building of their great monastery


23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,800
but also in the stunning book art
they made up here.


24
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,800
So intricate, so detailed,
so difficult.


25
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,240
And that's the thing
about the north's contribution to


26
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,480
the art of the Dark Ages.


27
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,960
What it achieved,
it achieved by going the extra mile,


28
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:31,800
working the extra hour,
adding the extra detail.


29
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,480
Nothing was given to it on a plate.


30
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,680
In this film, we are going to be
looking at the Carolingians,


31
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,760
Dark Age expansionists from France,
whose huge empire gobbled up most


32
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:37,000
of modern Europe but who made art
of exquisite finesse and richness.


33
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,760
Also the Vikings, who, despite
their terrible reputation for raping


34
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,400
and pillaging, were actually
exceptionally inventive craftsman.


35
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,080
The extreme delicacy of
Dark Age Viking art


36
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,960
is an unexpected pleasure.


37
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,520
Then up here in
the north of England,


38
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,640
we'll be celebrating
the Dark Age nation


39
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,720
whose artistic handiwork was
admired across the whole of Europe.


40
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,120
I'm thinking, of course,
of the Anglo-Saxons -


41
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,520
so skilled, so hard-working,
so ingenious.


42
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,200
Speaking of hard work,


43
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,440
one of the things we are going to be
doing in this film is following


44
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,280
the creation of an Anglo-Saxon
jewel from start to finish.


45
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,440
Later on, I'll introduce you
properly to Shaun Greenhalgh here.


46
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,960
For now, all that really matters is
that he's going to be making


47
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:55,600
something exquisite - a silver disc
brooch in the Anglo-Saxon manner.


48
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,320
Shaun Greenhalgh's
Anglo-Saxon brooch


49
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,200
is a pleasure we
are saving for later.


50
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,080
First, we need to confront the
north's most notorious barbarians.


51
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,800
We've tackled some terrifying
warrior nations in this series -


52
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,280
the Huns, the Vandals, the Goths -
but when it comes to


53
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:32,280
bellicosity, no-one has quite as
fearsome reputation as the Vikings.


54
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,280
You know, people get
so much wrong about the Vikings.


55
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,840
They didn't wear these ridiculous
helmets, for a start.


56
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,040
These were invented in the
19th century by a stage designer


57
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,600
working on a Wagner opera.


58
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,080
He had to make one of the singing
Vikings look particularly evil


59
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,280
so he stuck
the devil's horns on a helmet


60
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,280
and the Vikings have been lumbered
with these helmets ever since.


61
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,640
This is what their helmets
really looked like.


62
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,520
The only surviving Viking helmet
in the National Museum in Oslo.


63
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,440
The Vikings were particularly
interesting because, while all the


64
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,960
other Germanic tribes headed south


65
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,560
and became thoroughly Italianate,
the Vikings stayed in the harsh


66
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,880
and windy north where
they clung to the old ways.


67
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,640
So, they were a barbarian
nation of a pure and exciting type.


68
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,200
The Vikings were a living link to
an older and deeper European past.


69
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,160
There were forces at work in them
that civilisation hadn't dimmed.


70
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,880
And that's what's
so exciting about them.


71
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,360
In fact, most of the time
they were simple farmers,


72
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,120
tending the land, keeping livestock,
growing what they could.


73
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,200
But in the lands of the Vikings,
you can't go very far without


74
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,280
encountering water.


75
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,720
And this constant
presence of the sea had turned them


76
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,920
into superb sailors.


77
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,080
Exactly where they reached is
still fiercely debated


78
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,960
but they certainly got to Greenland
and then to Newfoundland.


79
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,760
The Vikings discovered America
a long, long time before Columbus.


80
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,760
So, boatmanship was
one of their great achievements


81
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,400
and another of their great
achievements was art.


82
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,960
In the great years of Viking
expansion,


83
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,280
roughly 800 AD to roughly 1100 AD,


84
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,680
the Vikings put almost
as much energy


85
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,560
into making their own art as they
did into stealing other people's.


86
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,840
This trefoil Viking brooch was
modelled on the buckles


87
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,040
used by Roman soldiers
on their sword belts.


88
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:19,440
The Vikings adapted it and turned
it into a brooch for ladies.


89
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,200
Much of what they made is
so intricate and fine,


90
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,800
it's difficult to see.


91
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,200
So, to make it absolutely clear
what adventurous creatives


92
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,480
they were, I've brought you to Oslo,


93
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,160
to one of the great
Viking museums where


94
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,680
I wanted to show you this whopping
great nautical masterpiece.


95
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,640
On 8th August 1903,


96
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,400
a Norwegian farmer called Knut Rom
knocked on the door of


97
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:02,440
Professor Gabriel Gustafson of the
Museum of Antiquities here in Oslo.


98
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:05,080
While digging on his farm,
said Knut Rom,


99
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:11,560
he had come across a buried ship
and he thought it might be Viking.


100
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,440
Two days later, Professor Gustafson
arrived at the farm


101
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,960
and confirmed the discovery of this
thing - the Oseberg ship.


102
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,520
Will you look at that, eh?


103
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,320
It's made entirely of oak.


104
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,760
Over 60 feet long, 15 feet wide


105
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,080
and decorated at both ends with
these boisterous Viking carvings.


106
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,000
Inside the ship
were two dead bodies -


107
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,720
an older woman
who may have been a queen


108
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,120
and a younger woman, probably
her slave who was buried with her.


109
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,720
There were also 14 horses,
three dogs and an ox,


110
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,000
all sacrificed together
and buried with their master.


111
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,200
In the stern of the boat
was a four-wheeled cart,


112
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,440
the first such Viking cart
ever discovered.


113
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,200
But no-one seemed to sure what
the weather was going to


114
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,800
be like in heaven because there
were also four sledges.


115
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,080
But it's the carving of these boats
and carts


116
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,960
and sledges that makes this
particular Viking find so exciting.


117
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,520
Look at the elegant
line of this ship,


118
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,760
how it ends so gracefully up there
with the curved head of the snake.


119
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,560
At either end, above the waterline
where they can be seen,


120
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,520
are these busy expanses of carving,
so active and lively.


121
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,920
Scores of twisting bodies,
clutching hands, staring eyes,


122
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,200
sniffing snouts,
all jumbled together excitedly.


123
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,240
A gymnasium of animal acrobats
tying themselves into knots.


124
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,760
You have to get your eye in with
Viking carvings otherwise


125
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,320
they can frighten you with
all this amazing complication.


126
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,040
It's all based on animal shapes all
interwoven and overlapping.


127
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,520
So, that, for example,
is one animal.


128
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,960
There is the head and
there is the tail.


129
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,760
And this figure eight shape here,
that's the whole of its body.


130
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,840
And that's biting
the tail of this animal here.


131
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,520
And that animal is biting
the tail of the animal and so on.


132
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:53,080
So, imagine the 3-D vision you
need to carve this,


133
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,360
the steady hand, the computer brain.


134
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,720
So, if anyone ever says to you,
"The Vikings were barbarous,"


135
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,240
grab them by the ear
and tug them here to Oslo.


136
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,280
Runes.


137
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,800
More runes.


138
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,560
And still more runes.


139
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,600
All over
Scandinavia, Norway, Denmark


140
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,320
and particularly here in Sweden,


141
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,040
you find these magnificent
standing stones, left


142
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,120
behind by the Vikings, covered in
wobbly carvings


143
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,520
and all these runes.


144
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,600
Runes are the bits of writing
on the twisty snakes.


145
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,680
You usually find them
on Viking gravestones.


146
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,360
These ones here say,


147
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:10,160
"Gidiyor loved her husband
and remembers him with her tears."


148
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,000
Because they're carved on these
mighty stones


149
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,600
and not written down on handy
bits of parchment or vellum,


150
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,920
there is a tendency
to mythologise them,


151
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,800
to see great truths in the runes.


152
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,800
According to Norse mythology,
the runes were found by Odin,


153
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,280
the supreme god of the Norsemen,


154
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:43,880
while he was hanging in the tree
of life, the famous Yggdrasil.


155
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,240
For nine days and nights,
Odin stayed in the great tree,


156
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,480
waiting, hoping, until eventually
the runes fell into his hands


157
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,040
and revealed themselves to him.


158
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,560
Odin passed them to us.


159
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,760
Thus, from the start,
the runes were associated with magic


160
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,760
and the mysteries of the cosmos.


161
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,360
This splendid story about Odin
up in the trees


162
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,000
and the origin of the runes
is another example


163
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,600
of the extraordinary power that
words had in these fateful years.


164
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:36,200
Words, letters, symbols seem to mean
so much in the Dark Ages.


165
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,840
They were so loaded,
they had such resonance.


166
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,680
It's actually quite a simple
alphabet.


167
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,200
So, this shape here that is a V
sound, that's an A, L and so on.


168
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,360
So that says, "Waldemar." And in
fact this whole message is,


169
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,600
"Here stands Waldemar
in Viking land."


170
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,680
The runic alphabet,
or Futhark as it is called,


171
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,360
had 24 letters in it originally.


172
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,520
Later on,
when the Vikings attacked Britain,


173
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,720
they took the runes with them
and the Futhark grew to 33 letters.


174
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,200
The new letters were needed
to describe new sounds.


175
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,840
Every time the Vikings conquered
a new territory


176
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,440
and new words entered their
language,


177
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,720
they needed new letters to
describe them.


178
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,120
So, for example,
originally there was no W


179
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,920
and I had to use a V
sound for my name, Waldemar.


180
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,440
So, the runes were never some
cobweb-covered dead language


181
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,400
fit only for the museum,
they were always alive,


182
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,240
vibrant and constantly changing.


183
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:38,240
What a good-looking alphabet it is,
too. So energetic and upright.


184
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,640
It is based on vertical lines
because verticals are easier


185
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:48,520
to carve, particularly in wood
but also in stone.


186
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,600
This vertical emphasis gives
the runes a spiky presence and a


187
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,680
mysterious relationship with time,


188
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,120
as if every mark is somehow
counting down the days.


189
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,960
The Vikings were the last
of the great barbarian nations to


190
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,640
convert to Christianity.


191
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,480
It wasn't until the 10th century,
1,000 years after


192
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,800
the birth of Christ, that paganism's
hold on the frozen north was broken.


193
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,920
So, around here,
the paganism was stubborn.


194
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:35,840
And in Viking art, it's often
difficult to tell where the


195
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,520
paganism ends
and the Christianity begins.


196
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,120
This is the biggest and most famous
of all Scandinavian rune stones -


197
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,840
the Jelling stone.


198
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,400
It weighs over 10 tonnes.


199
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,440
It is two and a half metres tall
and, as you can see,


200
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,600
the entire stone seems to writhe
with energy.


201
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,040
What a fabulous thing.


202
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,880
This inscription here,
which goes all the way round,


203
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:20,960
tells us that the Jelling stone
was put here by Harald Bluetooth,


204
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,040
the energetic Viking ruler who is
usually credited with


205
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,400
converting the Danes to
Christianity.


206
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,360
"I am Harald," it says here,


207
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,400
"Son of Gorm and I made the Danes
Christians."


208
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,960
It is carved on all three sides
and on this side is


209
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,840
an image of a giant snake
attacking a stylised lion.


210
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,360
Now, obviously there are no
lions in Scandinavia,


211
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,800
it's an image they found abroad,
but the Vikings identified with


212
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,680
the lion's fighting spirit
so it pops up a lot in their art.


213
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,680
It is an image they made theirs.


214
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,240
Now, I know what you're thinking.


215
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,000
You're thinking,
"What lion and what snake?"


216
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,680
Well, inside the visitors centre
at Jelling,


217
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:17,440
there is a coloured replica
of the great stone which shows


218
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,600
you how the lion and the snake
would originally have


219
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,040
looked before all their paint
fell off.


220
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,720
But the most surprising sight is
here on the biggest side.


221
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:37,080
It is the culmination of the entire
stone but you can't see it yet.


222
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,240
The light has to be exactly right.


223
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,160
What you have to do is wait


224
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,280
until the twilight begins to
work its magic.


225
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,360
Can you see it?


226
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,840
It is a splendid Viking
crucifixion with this stern Christ


227
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,320
in the centre surrounded
by all these writhing Viking knots.


228
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,000
It's as if the whole stone
can't keep still.


229
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,200
I like the way Christ hasn't
actually got a cross,


230
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,080
he's just standing there
with his arms outstretched.


231
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,720
So it is obviously another
image that has been


232
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,680
imported from abroad and is now
being misunderstood so confidently.


233
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,920
When the Vikings began behaving
like Vikings and invaded Britain,


234
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:00,640
they encountered the most exciting
jewellers of the Dark Ages -


235
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,680
the Anglo-Saxons.


236
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,840
How do we know they were exciting?


237
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,760
Because they have left behind this -


238
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,880
the Sutton Hoo treasure.


239
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,640
This is the finest hoard
of Anglo-Saxon gold ever dug up


240
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,680
in Britain, one of the great
treasures of the British Museum.


241
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,440
Just look at it.


242
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,640
My legs go weak every time I see it


243
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,000
because it is in such
excellent condition.


244
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,880
Much of the art that survives
from the Dark Ages has been


245
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:49,360
battered by time
but not the Sutton Hoo treasure.


246
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,800
In the finest pieces here and there
is hardly a gram of gold bent


247
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:57,080
out of place or a garnet missing.


248
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,800
The Sutton Hoo treasure was dug up
out of the ground


249
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,560
in East Anglia just a few


250
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:09,640
weeks before the start of the
Second World War in 1939, so it


251
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,440
couldn't be investigated properly
until after the war was over,


252
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,920
and what a torture that must have
been for the waiting archaeologists.


253
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,000
The treasure dates
from around 620 AD


254
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,440
and comes from the grave
of an important East Anglian king.


255
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:38,080
The king was buried in a ship,
his transport to the next world.


256
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,560
And all this was buried with him
to serve him in the afterlife.


257
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,000
These bits of sword, here,


258
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,960
and the helmets mark him
out as a mighty warrior.


259
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,400
You wouldn't want to get on the
wrong side of this man, never.


260
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,120
They found a lyre
in his grave as well


261
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,120
so the king could listen to his
favourite music in the afterlife.


262
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,640
That's a recreation of it.


263
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,680
He had to eat well


264
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,640
so this fabulous cooking cauldron
was buried with him.


265
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,200
Look at all the intricate Celtic
decoration around it.


266
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,280
Most important of all,


267
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,680
the people who buried the King made
sure that he would look good in


268
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:36,320
the next world by burying him with
his best Anglo-Saxon ruler bling,


269
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,760
which is where this gold comes in
and those magnificent garnets.


270
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,520
If you have ever seen finer
jewellery than this,


271
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,720
let me know where
because I want to go there.


272
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,280
How did they do it,
these Anglo-Saxon wizards?


273
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:07,800
To penetrate their secrets,
I have tracked down a man who knows.


274
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,960
In his youth, Shaun Greenhalgh
was a skilled forger


275
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,000
and some of the world's greatest
museums have admired his output.


276
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,400
Shaun was finally caught
and sent to prison


277
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,120
so he has served his time and these
days puts all this expertise


278
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,080
to much better
use as an independent craftsmen.


279
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,160
The methods he uses aren't exactly
the same as the methods


280
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,480
of the Dark Ages - the modern world
has changed too much for that -


281
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,320
but they are about as close
as you can get.


282
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:49,960
And what Shaun's work gives
us is an insider's view of how


283
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,160
Anglo-Saxon jewellers actually
made their pieces.


284
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,720
So, Shaun, can you tell us what it
is you're going to be making?


285
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,280
It's an Anglo-Saxon disc brooch,
silver, with some enamel gilding...


286
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,320
covering most of the aspects that
Anglo-Saxon jewellers would use.


287
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,320
They obviously had lots of
different techniques in the way


288
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,720
they made their jewellery, so which
ones are you picking up here?


289
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,640
This is probably the 10th century,
it's like a late Saxon disc brooch,


290
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,520
the earlier ones with the golden
garnet, mostly,


291
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,760
but these are the ones with
religious symbolism on them.


292
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,800
Is this based on an existing brooch?


293
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,960
No, it's my own design, but it kind
of encompasses elements of other


294
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,040
things going off, so it's an
original design in itself.


295
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,600
The centre part will be
done in gold ribbon,


296
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,160
plus all the different
coloured enamels.


297
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,880
And that's a picture of an
Anglo Saxon king?


298
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,640
Yes, with just a generic
long-tache beard with


299
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,680
a sword in his right hand,


300
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,400
and the element I haven't actually
put in is the hand


301
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,840
of God over his shoulder, that will
be done in white and gold enamel.


302
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,720
Wonderful, let's get going.


303
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,240
OK, let's get on with it.


304
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,120
MONASTIC CHANTING


305
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,200
The delights of Shaun's Anglo-Saxon


306
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,880
disc brooch will have to wait.


307
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,440
First, we need to cross the Channel
and search out those powerful


308
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,880
Dark Age creatives,


309
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,480
the Carolingians -


310
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,360
rulers of the Franks.


311
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,920
The Franks were
the ancestors of the modern French.


312
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,320
Originally, they were Germans,


313
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,520
just like the Anglo-Saxons,


314
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,280
but they arrived in Gaul on one
of those expansionist,


315
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,280
barbarian waves that we
saw in film two.


316
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
And early in their story,


317
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,800
the Franks converted to
Christianity,


318
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,640
and they became particularly fierce
defenders of the faith.


319
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,040
Plenty of Dark Age societies
liked their art to sparkle.


320
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,240
A taste for gold


321
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,720
is one of the Dark
Ages' defining characteristics.


322
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,600
But when it comes to
religious bling,


323
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,400
the Frankish Christians were
top of the charts.


324
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,720
If you have ever wondered why
the French sometimes conduct


325
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,920
themselves as if they were
the chosen people, it's


326
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,480
because that's exactly what
they thought they were.


327
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,680
In 732 AD,


328
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,720
the Franks, led by the heroic
Charles Martel,


329
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,600
Charles the Hammer,


330
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,760
defeated an invading Muslim army,


331
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,520
which had come up from Spain,
hoping to conquer Europe.


332
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,560
The Franks believed that God
had chosen them


333
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,920
to save Europe from Islam.


334
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,360
They were his chosen people.


335
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,120
And their art seems
particularly aware of this special


336
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,560
position in God's good books.


337
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,440
The mightiest of the Frankish kings,


338
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,040
Charles the Great, or Charlemagne


339
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,760
as he's usually called,


340
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,080
came from a
dynasty called the Carolingians.


341
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,080
He was crowned in 768,


342
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,040
and with typical Frankish modesty,


343
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,640
pushed himself right to
the front of Dark Age politics.


344
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,400
Charlemagne was determined to expand
the Frankish empire.


345
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,760
After all,
it was God's chosen empire,


346
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,280
and the Carolingians were God's
chosen leaders.


347
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,080
This expansion
of Charlemagne's Christian Empire,


348
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,680
was achieved with deep brutality.


349
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,880
In Germany, the Saxons,
who were still pagans,


350
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,200
were given a very simple choice -


351
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,120
convert to Christianity, or die.


352
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,160
If they didn't become Christians,
they were killed.


353
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
That was Charlemagne's choice.


354
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,480
In 800 AD,


355
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,480
in Rome, on Christmas Day itself,


356
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,960
the Pope rewarded Charlemagne
for his efforts on behalf


357
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,640
of Christianity


358
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,880
by crowning him
as the Holy Roman Emperor.


359
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,120
Charlemagne was now the leader
of the largest empire Europe had


360
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,400
seen since the fall of the Romans.


361
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,320
The centre of gravity of Europe
had shifted,


362
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,440
and it had shifted to the north.


363
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,960
This is the chapel that Charlemagne
built, here in Aachen


364
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,880
on the Belgian borders.


365
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,880
And from here,
he ruled his new Christian Empire.


366
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:23,120
This is actually the marble
throne on which he sat.


367
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,240
There's a spooky simplicity to
Charlemagne's throne...


368
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,840
..four slabs of ancient marble,


369
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,600
a few metal clamps.


370
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,920
Six marble steps and that's it.


371
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,400
A gold-loving Emperor


372
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,400
is pretending to be a simple man.


373
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,480
Charlemagne began building this
chapel in 786 AD.


374
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,560
And at exactly the same time,
in Spain,


375
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:06,040
the Muslims were building the Great
Mosque, in Cordoba,


376
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,600
which I hope you
remember from the last film.


377
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,840
Such inventive,
and dramatic architecture,


378
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,920
with those nimble, double arches,


379
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,280
and that gorgeous forest of columns.


380
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,520
Charlemagne's chapel, this chapel,


381
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,320
was intended to be a deliberate
riposte to the Muslims.


382
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,800
A Christian answer to
the Cordoba mosque.


383
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,320
Look up there, at the arches,


384
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,080
and see how they have these
alternating


385
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,480
bands of colour,


386
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:49,080
just like the
arches in the Cordoba mosque.


387
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,960
But in Aachen, the stripy arches
don't float or soar...


388
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,520
..nothing does.


389
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:05,320
This is architecture drawn with
the biceps, not the wrist...


390
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,080
..effortful, and ponderous.


391
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,840
I don't like this building,


392
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,120
it feels brutal, clunky.


393
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,800
This round shape,


394
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,120
was based originally on a Roman
mausoleum, and you can still


395
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,280
sense the doomy and cold atmospheres
of the mausoleum in here.


396
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,360
Gloomy,


397
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,320
expensive,


398
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,480
intense.


399
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,920
Frankish Christianity bulldozes the
senses.


400
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:49,360
But it doesn't really pleasure
them, at least I don't think so.


401
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,600
In the battle
of the northern Christians,


402
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,040
give me Anglo-Saxon art, any day.


403
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,800
Christianity arrived in Britain
from three directions at once,


404
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,680
in a three-pronged religious
assault.


405
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,760
In the south, in ancient Kent,


406
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,640
a team of monks led by St Augustine


407
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,640
were sent here by the Pope in Rome.


408
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,240
They brought with them the official
Roman version of Christianity.


409
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,080
Up here, in the north of Britain,
it was Irish


410
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,240
monks from across the sea,
who came over to convert the pagans,


411
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,120
and they brought with them,
a harsher, more basic,


412
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,960
more penitential form of
Christianity.


413
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:12,720
locations, and where they produced
glorious art with an ecstatic


414
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,880
and insistent tone to it, like the
chanting of a great monks' choir,


415
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,600
The third type of Christians
found in Anglo-Saxon Britain,


416
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,440
were the ones who were already here.


417
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,280
Remember, in film one, how the
Romans converted to Christianity,


418
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,560
under Constantine, and how one of
the earliest known Christian


419
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:44,240
house churches was found in Roman
Britain, in Lullingstone, in Kent.


420
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,280
We don't know much about these
existing Christians,


421
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,520
they were a modest Christian
presence.


422
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:59,240
But perhaps,
tiny droplets of this modesty were


423
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,920
thrown into the melting pot,
as well.


424
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,760
So, the Anglo-Saxons
would have had wood-heated kilns?


425
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
Charcoal brazier, I should imagine.


426
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,040
This is the stuff I'm going to
make the brooch out of.


427
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,480
It's basically about 82% silver,
a bit of copper,


428
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,880
quite a lot of lead,


429
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,480
which designates as Anglo-Saxon or
Viking, a few other bits


430
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,160
and parts of it, all the trace
elements


431
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,520
you don't get in modern silver.


432
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,200
Shaun melts down the Anglo-Saxon
silver and, to turn it into


433
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:43,120
something useful, pours it into some
moulds made from cuttlefish bones.


434
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,640
So tell me about this cuttlefish,


435
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:52,480
is this what was used in ancient
times to make moulds?


436
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,080
It's been used for centuries,


437
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,440
I should imagine it's a Roman
tradition, actually.


438
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,320
I take them out the mould,
they should be relatively cool now.


439
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,360
Right, that's actual ingot there,
that's for the pin,


440
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,240
and the pin mount,
so I'll quench that first of all.


441
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,400
So that basically cools it down...


442
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,200
It cleans all that other stuff off.


443
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,320
Right...


444
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,480
..the next thing to do is to reduce
this piece of silver


445
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,960
for the main body down to about
one and a half millimetres,


446
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,600
to replicate Anglo-Saxon disc
brooches


447
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,480
that have been in existence.


448
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,080
So, first of all, you have to beat
from the centre to the outside.


449
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,960
You always go outside to inside,
inside to out, reversing every time.


450
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,520
So you're making it thinner?
Yeah, basically, yeah.


451
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,920
On the other side, you start at the
centre and work to the middle.


452
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,560
That's keeping a uniform thickness,
because it tends to bowl,


453
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,760
to an actual bowl shape
cos it starts to split


454
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,760
once you start to spread it
out even further.


455
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,720
You hear the dull thud of it now,


456
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,600
because we're hammering it, it gets
higher and higher, the pitch.


457
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,720
With the ear, you can tell
when it's hard enough,


458
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,000
so you don't crack it.


459
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,560
That has more or less brought it,
to the next stage,


460
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,960
so it's just a matter of us
now repeating the process,


461
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,760
and as we reduce it,
the area will get larger.


462
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,520
And once we've made a big enough
piece,


463
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,680
and reduced it to
one and a half millimetres,


464
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,640
or thereabouts, we'll have a large
enough piece to cut the disc out of,


465
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:36,520
so this is one and a half
millimetres, as you can see.


466
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,960
That is just the same as this, it is
just the same silver,


467
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,280
but I've worked on it,
it's taken about two days' work,


468
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,640
a lot of hammer-work,
and a lot of earbashing.


469
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,240
Fallen out with your neighbours,
and what have yous


470
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,600
to get it to that,
so we'll start on with this now.


471
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,760
But that is the basic
shape of the brooch?


472
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,520
That is
the basic shape of the brooch.


473
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,400
While Shaun Greenhalgh
bangs away in his lair,


474
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,400
back at the front line
of the Dark Ages,


475
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:14,600
the Anglo-Saxon custom of burying
the dead with things that would be


476
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:20,400
useful to them in the afterlife,
was, of course, a pagan custom.


477
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,400
And, unfortunately,


478
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,800
when the Anglo-Saxons were converted
to Christianity,


479
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,240
that custom was stopped.


480
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,840
For a Christian burial, you buried
the body and that was it,


481
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,800
so nothing as sumptuous as the
Sutton Hoo treasure


482
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,480
has survived from the Christian era.


483
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,600
Instead, we get another
kind of Anglo-Saxon treasure.


484
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,160
It's a treasure made of granite
and limestone...


485
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,640
..the resilient,


486
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:08,200
spiritual treasure that is
the Anglo-Saxon funeral cross.


487
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,080
Earlier on, we saw how the
Vikings commemorated their dead,


488
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,800
with these mighty standing stones
covered in runes.


489
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,200
This idea,
that stone is somehow eternal,


490
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,120
and lasts much longer than you,


491
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:33,000
is something that was shared by all
the voyaging tribes of the north.


492
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,680
There's something splendidly basic
about these Anglo-Saxon crosses.


493
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,240
They're supposed to be Christian,
but somehow, their Christianity


494
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:51,120
feels superficial
and confined to the surface.


495
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:57,360
Underneath, you can still sense
the atmospheres of Stonehenge -


496
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,800
a connection with the faraway past,


497
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,880
and the central
mysteries of Creation.


498
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,840
See all this decoration here?
It's called interlacing, it's


499
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:18,600
Celtic in origin, you get it on the
Anglo-Saxon crosses, but also the


500
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:22,840
great manuscripts written later in
the monasteries like Lindisfarne.


501
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,120
A lot of people have written
a lot of books on the subject


502
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,480
of Celtic interlacing -


503
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,760
what it means, why it was used.


504
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:41,040
It's so beautiful to look at, but
also, so intrinsically mysterious.


505
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,720
They say that its origins lie in
basket weaving and plaiting,


506
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,520
and we'll never know for sure,


507
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:56,760
but my guess is that this is also an
attempt by the Dark Age mind


508
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:04,280
to grasp and mimic the rhythms of
Creation, to convey the sense


509
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,280
that the cosmos goes on and on,


510
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,280
and that everything in it
is interrelated.


511
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,560
This is a rather wonky specimen,
which is why I like it so much.


512
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,080
It's not quite right,
so you just want to hug it.


513
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,800
but because it's so wonky, the
interlacing on the Lonan cross


514
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,080
in the Isle of Man, is particularly
clear.


515
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,880
We're going to be seeing a lot of
this Celtic interlacing


516
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,400
in the marvellous manuscripts that
are coming up,


517
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,760
so I just wanted to show you
quickly how it was done.


518
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,800
It looks immensely confident,
but it's actually relatively simple.


519
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,360
So first,
you need to mark out a grid.


520
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,040
Say we want to do a decorative
border on a Gospel book,


521
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,720
so, if here's the border,
and we know from unfinished


522
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,480
bits of manuscript the monks have
left behind that the way


523
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:32,000
he did it was to make this grid
with dots to guide them.


524
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,920
So, three dots, two dots,
three dots, three dots, two dots,


525
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,200
two dots.


526
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,800
They're like the dots on a dice.
Three, two, three, two.


527
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,560
Then you start
filling in the spaces in-between.


528
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:56,560
Now the big rule in interlacing is
that one line goes over...


529
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,720
..and the other line goes under.


530
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,480
Over, under, over, under, over,
under - all the way along.


531
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,160
And when you're about to get to
the edge, you stop,


532
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,000
because you need to work out
how you're going to do the edges.


533
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,440
Now I'm just going to square
them off,


534
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,840
that's the simplest way of doing it.


535
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:23,720
But they also did all these
elaborate things,


536
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:28,000
they'd leave out bits of the
pattern and create this


537
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,280
kind of asymmetrical symmetry.


538
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,320
That's too complicated for me,
I'm afraid.


539
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:40,360
And once you got your over,
under, over, under -


540
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,320
then you start to fill in the
bits of the background.


541
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,280
Red and black.


542
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,200
There you are.
A bit of Celtic interlacing.


543
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,120
So I've done this very big,


544
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,200
because I've got insensitive
and stubby fingers.


545
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,680
But if you're a Dark Age monk,


546
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:23,440
poring over a precious manuscript,
then the borders you made were tiny.


547
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,480
I mean, these people must have had
extraordinary eyesight.


548
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,880
Of course, if you're
a sculptor on the other hand,


549
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,720
once you've designed your
interlacing,


550
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,680
you need to carve it into stone.


551
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,640
And it is mightily difficult, too.


552
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,320
And with this cross,
the Lonan cross,


553
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:53,640
you can see that the interlacing,
it's OK when it begins up here,


554
00:44:53,640 --> 00:45:00,840
but as it comes down, it gets
wonkier and wonkier and wonkier.


555
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,880
HAMMERING


556
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,960
Back in Bolton, Shaun Greenhalgh
has engraved the symbols


557
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,920
of the Four Evangelists round
the edges of his silver brooch.


558
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,440
And he's now ready for the really
difficult bit in the middle,


559
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:30,840
the Anglo-Saxon king, created so
carefully, with cloisonne enamels.


560
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,160
The cloisonne enamel technique
is a very old technique,


561
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,920
practised by the Romans,
and the Celts even, before them.


562
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,280
It's just powdered glass, ground up,


563
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,280
and mixed in with water
and just fired in the kiln.


564
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,640
The Anglo-Saxons
and other people in the Dark Ages,


565
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:51,320
and into the Middle Ages,
would use Roman glass tesseras,


566
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,760
ground up, the kind of thing you
see in wall mosaics


567
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,920
in Ravenna and such places,
Constantinople,


568
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,480
and such like, because although
they had the technology to make


569
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,640
glass, they didn't have the oxides
to get the various


570
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,920
colours, as you can see,
of the yellows and greens and blues.


571
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,480
The first stage is to lay down the
king's outlines in a delicate


572
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,040
framework of itsy-bitsy
bits of pure gold.


573
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,600
So fiddly, these little bits,
you know...


574
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,720
..the eyes and the nose.


575
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,880
'Then the really tough work begins.


576
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:36,080
'Getting the powdered glass into
this labyrinth of gold cells.'


577
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,760
Just filling in the background now,
the dark blue.


578
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,760
It's always better to get
the background in,


579
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,080
the largest area,
to fill the largest area,


580
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,800
and it kind of holds
most of the wires in position,


581
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,320
so, you know...
pushing everything about.


582
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,720
Careful you don't drop
any into the other cells,


583
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,800
otherwise it all has to be
washed off if you do that.


584
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,840
Start again.


585
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,040
Right, just got to work out
the colour schemes now.


586
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,480
I think the yellows can go in next,
so I'll mix some yellow. Right.


587
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,520
Here we go.


588
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,880
Now.


589
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,040
The difficult part, to fill
the small pieces,


590
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,520
cos just touching them, the surface
tension tends to glue them


591
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,400
to the damn brush.


592
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,120
So...


593
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,720
Slowly does it, I think.


594
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,840
Then we'll put the tache in that.
Long droop here.


595
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,880
Edward the Confessor tache.


596
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,440
That's the hair. Bit yellow.


597
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,680
A General Custer hair-do.


598
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:52,600
It's just slow, fiddly work,
you know,


599
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,880
always fighting the surface
tension with it because...


600
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,480
Now some pale
green into the cloak itself


601
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,800
and then we're ready for firing
when we've dried it out.


602
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,080
All right.


603
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:13,800
'While Shaun prepares to pop
his Anglo-Saxon king into the kiln,


604
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,760
'I'm thinking that his brooch
reminds me strongly of the most


605
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:25,440
'famous of all Anglo-Saxon jewels -
the so-called Alfred Jewel.


606
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,320
'They say that originally it was
the top of a reading implement,


607
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:35,560
'sent out to the bishops
by King Alfred himself.


608
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,880
'It's now found
in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford,


609
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,680
'and what a beautiful thing it is.'


610
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,760
So this style of brooch was
obviously a late Anglo-Saxon...?


611
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,000
Yeah, probably 10th century,
I imagine, in the design.


612
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,160
A lot of people always say that
the Anglo-Saxon jewellery


613
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,200
was at its peak earlier than that.
They think of the Sutton Hoo horde.


614
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,480
The garnet stuff
and the garnet jewellery,


615
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,000
the gold or what have you.


616
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,280
Fashions change,
I suppose. I prefer the later stuff.


617
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,880
I think it's more elegant
and there's far more to it.


618
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,280
Any way, that's the cloisonne
finished. Beautiful.


619
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,640
So that's obviously an echo, if you
like, of the Alfred Jewel, isn't it?


620
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,920
Yeah. It's kind of like a mishmash
of various things,


621
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,800
but it's all of its time and period.


622
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,200
Can I have a look at that?
Yeah. I see, yes.


623
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,440
Beautiful. And who is this figure
you've put on here?


624
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:35,800
It's King Alfred, is it?


625
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:40,400
No, just a generic...figure
of a Saxon king, I suppose,


626
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,960
with the long tache
and the pointy beard


627
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,160
and the blond hair and blue eyes,


628
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:48,280
kind of how they liked to portray
themselves, I imagine.


629
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,000
Anyway, we just have to get on now
and assemble it. Yes.


630
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,120
We'll do that next,
shall we? Yes. Right.


631
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,960
First thing to do is put the crystal
into the silver gilt collar.


632
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,320
Then that just drops into there.


633
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,320
And then this piece will be riveted
on the back


634
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,800
with these little rivets.


635
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,040
So I'll put them in now so we can
have a bit of fiddle with this.


636
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,480
And there we have it. That it?


637
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,240
I'm finished. That's beautiful!


638
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,680
Thank you.
The Shaun Greenhalgh Jewel.


639
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,560
Move it about in the light,


640
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,760
you can get the edges of the actual
gold cloisonne and it sparkles.


641
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,000
Beautiful.


642
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,160
I love cloisonne work. Love it.


643
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,400
SEAGULLS CRY


644
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:54,240
WATER SPLASHES


645
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,880
Up in the harsher
corners of the Anglo-Saxon world,


646
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,080
the Irish monks who converted
the north of Britain


647
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:07,720
were deliberately cutting themselves
off from life's little comforts.


648
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:11,640
Exiles for Christ,
they called themselves.


649
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,360
Lindisfarne up there,


650
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:21,480
where the monastery was founded
by St Aidan in 635 AD,


651
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:26,640
was deliberately out of the way,
secluded.


652
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:32,600
When the tide was out, the only
way across was along this path here,


653
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:37,720
The Pilgrim's Way, it was called,
marked out with these wooden stakes.


654
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,720
But if you were coming
from the other side of the island,


655
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:45,720
from the sea, then Lindisfarne
wasn't cut off at all.


656
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,200
In fact, it was very tempting.


657
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,040
MEN SHOUT


658
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,880
'The Viking raids on Britain,
which did so much to tarnish


659
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:02,240
'the reputations of the Norse men,
began with a raid on Lindisfarne


660
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:07,760
'in 793, and for the next century
or so,


661
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,200
'the Vikings kept coming back.'


662
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,680
Monasteries were easy pickings.


663
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:21,120
They were basically undefended,
manned by peaceful monks,


664
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:25,280
and they were packed with sumptuous
religious treasures


665
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:29,880
and excellently
positioned for Viking raids.


666
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:38,920
'The monasteries of the Dark Ages
were Aladdin's caves of treasures.


667
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,400
'Jewel-encrusted relic boxes...


668
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:48,120
'golden crosses studded with rubies
and pearls.'


669
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,160
'We live in a world in which
Louis Vuitton luggage


670
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:59,480
'and Jimmy Choo shoes seem precious.


671
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,400
'In the Dark Ages, they knew
better.'


672
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,120
For the Vikings, the main
attraction of the monasteries


673
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:15,360
was obviously all that fabulous
Christian gold in them -


674
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,920
the rubies, the pearls -


675
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,520
but it's recently been suggested
that there were other reasons


676
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,200
why they targeted the monasteries.


677
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,080
Religious reasons.


678
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:32,480
Remember, in 793 AD when they raided
Lindisfarne, the Vikings


679
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,080
were still hardcore pagans,


680
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:39,920
stubborn believers in Odin, Thor
and Freya.


681
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,360
'For these Pagan Vikings,
the fierce missionary


682
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:50,720
'enthusiasm of the Irish monks
and the brutal conversion


683
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:56,360
'tactics of Charlemagne constituted
an assault on their religion.'


684
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,840
The Vikings liked being pagans.


685
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:06,640
They didn't like being told they
were worshipping the wrong gods,


686
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,640
so when they attacked
the monasteries,


687
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,960
it wasn't just to grab all this
fabulous Christian loot,


688
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,840
it was also a form of religious
payback.


689
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:23,840
"You think our religion's wrong,
we think your religion's wrong."


690
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,520
'The monks on Lindisfarne were also
fighting a religious war.


691
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:38,160
'Their monastery was a hive of busy
missionary activity.


692
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,720
'But unlike the Vikings
the preferred weapon of the monks


693
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,560
'wasn't the sword, but the word.'


694
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:54,000
You must have noticed that all the
way through this series,


695
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:59,520
I've been harping on about the power
of words in the Dark Ages.


696
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,400
I'm like a stuck
record on the subject.


697
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:11,720
'Words, letters, inscriptions.
They keep appearing in this story.


698
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:18,000
'And wherever they appear, they seem
to glow with Dark Age urgency.'


699
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:32,200
If you controlled the word in the
Dark Ages, you controlled the world.


700
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:37,880
For me, the most captivating
evidence of this immense power


701
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:41,400
that words had was the great book
created here


702
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,640
by the monks of Lindisfarne...


703
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,400
..the Lindisfarne Gospels.


704
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:59,040
'This isn't just one of the great
masterpieces of British art,


705
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:04,000
'this is one of the great
masterpieces of all art.


706
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,120
'Written and decorated
on Lindisfarne


707
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,320
'by a monk called Eadfrith,


708
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:16,240
'the Lindisfarne Gospel contains
a calligraphic cosmos


709
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,760
'of exceptional vitality.'


710
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:27,600
It contains the
four Gospels of the New Testament -


711
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:32,840
the story of Christ as told
by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John,


712
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:38,680
and each of these evangelists gets
a portrait to himself.


713
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:43,760
So there's St Matthew
writing his Gospel, and it says,


714
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:46,960
"Matteus", Matthew, up here.


715
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,240
All the portraits in here
are rather traditional.


716
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,000
They could easily be Italian
or Byzantine.


717
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:57,520
But then you turn the pages...


718
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:01,600
and you come across this.


719
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:05,800
This certainly isn't
traditional or Italian.


720
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:10,400
This is a uniquely British
contribution


721
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,880
to the art of the Dark Ages.


722
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,520
Look at all this amazing Celtic
inter-weaving that's filling


723
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,360
all the letters,


724
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:28,080
and all these cosmic swirls and
twirls and spirals.


725
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,280
It's like a magnificent
garden of paradise


726
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,840
that's erupted across the pages.


727
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:38,680
And yet, it's got this pagan
kick to it as well.


728
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:49,200
This is St John, the writer of the
fourth Gospel. That's his portrait.


729
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,640
And there above his head, the eagle.


730
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,760
That's his sign,
just so we know who it is.


731
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:01,240
And this is the actual
beginning of John's Gospel,


732
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:06,160
and look how astonishingly
beautiful it is.


733
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,640
Do you know what this says,


734
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,680
what all this amazingly
complicated interlacing


735
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:17,720
and all this cosmic calligraphy,
do you know what this says?


736
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:23,720
It says, "In principio erat Verbum.


737
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,920
"Et Verbum erat apud Deum."


738
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,280
"In the beginning was the Word.


739
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,520
"The Word was with God."


740
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:45,600
In the Lindisfarne Gospel, Christian
energy and Celtic inventiveness.


741
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,920
Pictures and letters
have come together


742
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,080
in cosmic adulation of the word.


743
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:03,560
So that's the story of the
Dark Ages. They weren't dark at all.


744
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,360
The Christians' struggle to imagine
their god


745
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:12,240
was one of the most exciting
struggles in art.


746
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:18,400
The barbarians were inventive
peoples who made glorious bling.


747
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:23,440
Islam spent these years
reaching for the stars,


748
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,960
while the Anglo-Saxons were
magnificent goldsmiths


749
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,720
and brilliant wordsmiths.


750
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,560
When William the Conqueror
invaded Britain in 1066


751
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:42,520
and brought the Dark Ages to some
sort of official end,


752
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:47,280
he brought to an end
one of the great ages of art.
