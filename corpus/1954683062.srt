1
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,810
Anguishing groans from
an unidentified man.

2
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,050
More groaning, heavy breathing,
stifled cries.

3
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,900
Man's cries become louder,
more desperate.

4
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,570
Terrible screams.

5
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,410
It happened a year ago.

6
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,540
I wish I could tell this story
from beginning to end but

7
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,480
I don't remember it that way.

8
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,480
I do remember...

9
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,450
Freddy, you promised me
the gig was mine.

10
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,020
Well, I changed my mind.

11
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,050
I need someone whose name I can
put on the flyer and pack this
room.

12
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,090
And that ain't you, pal.

13
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,760
Look, I got fired from The Void.
I need this shot, c'mon.

14
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,520
A real DJ gets this job.

15
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,790
I mean, what are you?

16
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,430
You're a nice guy,
but you ain't no real DJ.

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,830
Any idiot can be a iPod DJ.

18
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,700
At least tell me who you got?

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,740
What's up. How you're doing?

20
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:50,870
We're all set for you.

21
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,140
I'll give it an eye check.

22
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,870
What the fuck, Rekles?

23
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,480
Yeah, Rekles!

24
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,450
He's got Serato,
he actually mixes the music...

25
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,650
Plus he's got like
5,000 fans on-line.

26
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,680
What do you got?

27
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,150
Look, it's just business bro.

28
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,150
It's just business...?

29
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,590
Sound of angry gesture.

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,400
The rest of the story is in
fragments, bits and pieces that
jump around.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,730
I was hung up
on chance and faith,

32
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,400
trying to figure out why
I was going nowhere.

33
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,010
That's when she came along.

34
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,510
Eric, open up!

35
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,050
Eric, I know you're in there!

36
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,850
Come on!
It's an emergency!

37
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,620
We had a deal. I told you
not to come back tonight.

38
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,490
I know,
I need to stay here tonight.

39
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,550
Eric? Who's at the door?

40
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,090
Nothing, baby,
I'll be back in a minute!

41
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,020
Go the fuck away.

42
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,030
If you're in trouble,
I don't wanna be involved.

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,130
Eric, please!

44
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,160
I swear I'll call the fucking
cops!

45
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,500
OK, just let me get my things.

46
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,670
Signe, I'm dialing!

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,000
Stop, Jesus!

48
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,740
Just gimme my guitar.

49
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,410
And be careful with it!

50
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,080
My shoes!

51
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,810
Eric, fuck, I'm barefoot!

52
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,650
Christ...

53
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,790
The girl was in trouble.

54
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,890
But it wouldn't have been
my problem if Peter,

55
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,130
the guy she called first,
had picked up his phone.

56
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,640
Or Igor, the photog was probably
snapping shots downtown.

57
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,710
Steven couldn't see his part.

58
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,580
He started a midnight gym
routine

59
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,780
after she joked that his tits
were bigger than hers.

60
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,680
And calling Rachel was
pointless.

61
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,950
Their fling ended badly
after she told Rachel

62
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,650
she was just exploring.

63
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Rachel felt used.

64
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,060
That left me,

65
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,860
I was last on her list.

66
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,730
We met five weeks ago
at The Void,

67
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,900
I thought she was into me.

68
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,630
I got her digits, called her.
Never heard back until...

69
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:04,910
Hello?

70
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,840
August?

71
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,040
Hi!

72
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,910
Remember me?

73
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,750
The Swedish girl
you met at the The Void.

74
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,720
You're the girl who
doesn't call anybody back.

75
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,820
Yeah, I know,
I've been real busy.

76
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,120
I was wondering if you
wanna grab a drink or something?

77
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,120
I've been at The Void,
but I didn't see you.

78
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,830
Yeah, cause I got fired.

79
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,730
Oh...

80
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,600
Maybe I can help
to cheer you up.

81
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,900
Just one drink. Come on.
It'll be fun.

82
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,940
I dunno...

83
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,870
Hey listen...

84
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:41,640
I'm leaving the States
and I'd really love to see you.

85
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,510
It'll be worth your while.

86
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,710
I promise.

87
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,980
What to do.

88
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,420
Something about this
didn't sound right.

89
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,950
Then I remembered...

90
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,890
What did my horoscope say?

91
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,060
OK...

92
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,040
Meet me at Happy Ending,
Broome and Forsyth, 20 minutes.

93
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,470
OK, 20 minutes.

94
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,980
OK.

95
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,410
Are you nervous?

96
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,010
Terrified...

97
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,450
of your fashion sense.

98
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,650
What's going on with the get-up?

99
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,580
I got locked out of my
apartment.

100
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,620
So...
you need a place to crash?

101
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,660
Tell me this, you're just
locked out of their apartment

102
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,430
in a trench coat and flip-flops?

103
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,970
Are you waiting
for somebody else?

104
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,170
No.

105
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,670
Are you sure?

106
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,640
I just don't really wanna be
here.

107
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,010
If you get me...

108
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,940
Do you get me?

109
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,880
August.

110
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,430
Wow...

111
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,930
If I'd have known you were
that type of girl,

112
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,000
I would've paid you up front.

113
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,900
What are you doing with my
phone?

114
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,670
Don't touch that!

115
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,570
I'm about to call the police
to report a robbery,

116
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,070
I ain't using up my minutes,
this shit is expensive!

117
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:26,910
Put that down!

118
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,910
Are you kidding me, right?
You're going through my wallet,

119
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,980
now you want to get back
because I have your phone?

120
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,910
- You're crazy. - Listen, I just
needed some cash.

121
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:35,050
I put it back...

122
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,920
You don't know
what you're doing, OK?

123
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,720
Look, I should be kicking you
the fuck out.

124
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,390
But now you got me curious.

125
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,120
What do you got here?
Naughty pictures?

126
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,830
Who were you fucking last night
before me?

127
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,830
Give it to me!

128
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,690
Don't! Don't!

129
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,760
August! August!

130
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,450
Is this real?

131
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,890
What the fuck I'm looking at.
It is fucking real?

132
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:52,530
Ahhh...

133
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,740
It's the real to see death
right on front of you.

134
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,380
By the time it was all over,

135
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,780
this will be another thing

136
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,720
Nicholas and I
would have in common.

137
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,600
Does your father know?

138
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,900
What about your mother?

139
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:36,600
Mom's in the cottage
in Connecticut.

140
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,510
And you don't know
where the girl went?

141
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,610
No.

142
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,080
Let's forget
about the girl for now.

143
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,680
OK...

144
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,420
What is
your daily morning routine?

145
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:56,720
I go for a run and I practice
my...

146
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,760
Practice what?

147
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,060
OK.

148
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,070
Clean this all up.

149
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,000
Go for a drive, clear your mind.

150
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,610
Come back in an hour,

151
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:15,810
excercise,
practice whatever it is you do.

152
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,750
If she calls the cops,
I got friends there.

153
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,450
Your father's got friends there.

154
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,520
If she contacts you,

155
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,020
you call me immediately, huh?

156
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,760
Meantime, let's see what
I can learn about this...

157
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,430
I didn't mean for this to
happen.

158
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,100
Nobody ever does.

159
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,910
Abuela, I'm starvin'.

160
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,510
Where's your brother?

161
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,680
I dunno.

162
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,020
I said it a million times.
Do I look like his keeper?

163
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,860
There will be no food
for anyone here

164
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,690
until your brother comes home.

165
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,990
It's Sunday!

166
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,030
He is supposed to be here.

167
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,830
It's 11:30. He was supposed
to be here at eleven.

168
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,840
If you don't show up on time
in this life,

169
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,810
you always be left behind
in the next.

170
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,680
Where are you going?

171
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,950
I gotta go eat.
I ain't living like this.

172
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,080
Abuela...

173
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,660
You can't get yourself
worked up like this,

174
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,830
Alright?

175
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,030
Alright?

176
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,570
Yo, Sparky...

177
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,770
What's up, nigga?

178
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,640
Yo, you see
my little brother around?

179
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,470
You sure?

180
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,140
Jésus!

181
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,680
Hey yo...

182
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,780
Wake your ass up!

183
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,900
Hello, Yuri...

184
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,670
Yeah, the new supply got done.

185
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,940
He had some family shit
to deal with.

186
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,070
Alright.

187
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:41,720
You fuckin' amateur.

188
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,090
Angel's first clue was
in his brother's profile status.

189
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,060
Jésus was dealing again.

190
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,830
But Angel knew
where to look for him

191
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,460
because in the Lower East Side

192
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,030
veryone has a friend in common .

193
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,630
Even though I didn't know it,

194
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,170
the girl and I
were already linked,

195
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,970
but the chain starts with Jésus.

196
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,140
He friend-quested everyone
he dealt drugs to.

197
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,640
Most didn't accepted.

198
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,710
I was one of the few who did.

199
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,580
I came over with my parents from
Nigeria to Newark NJ at age of
7.

200
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,550
Yeah, people really do
emigrate to New Jersey.

201
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,990
All I wanted is to be a DJ.

202
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,760
I met a girl named Alicia and
had a short run

203
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:19,430
when she got me gigs with
the coked-out trust fund set.

204
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,400
I dropped out of college cause
we had plans for New York
together.

205
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,100
Until she dumped me
for a Rastafarian.

206
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,870
My parents practically
disowned me.

207
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,410
I got a job bar-backing at
The Void on Ludman Street,

208
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,410
But every night I dreamed that
I'd be spinning all over the
world,

209
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,550
Berlin, Amsterdam, London.

210
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,150
But I never get there until I
saved enough to buy a Serato
Scratch.

211
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,850
Then, I'd be legit.

212
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,390
So to get back to the girl,
there's a few more people along
the way.

213
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,860
But there is no need
to remember them all,

214
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,930
except for this guy... Amir.

215
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,630
He's the only friend
I could always count on.

216
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,930
There is definitely no need
to remember Jeremy.

217
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,770
He lasted less than a month
at The Void.

218
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:04,540
He was fired for inappropriate
use of the restroom.

219
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,610
He would've gotten away with it
if they didn't wreck the sink,

220
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,010
causing the manager to check
the security tape.

221
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,410
And never mind about
his lady friend, Suzie Voight,

222
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:17,420
an aspiring fashion designer
over at the FIT.

223
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,750
Or even her roommate,
Ana from Bogotá,

224
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,160
who moved here to intern
in documentary filmmaking.

225
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,930
Now this is where
it gets interesting.

226
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,830
Ana's co-worker Stephanie...

227
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,460
Stephanie, always told Ana about
a new guy she was seeing,

228
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,700
like the musician she met
a few weeks earlier named Eric.

229
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,770
I'll be back in a sec.

230
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,140
Eric had never told Stephanie
about his adventures in
Stockholm.

231
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,010
Which brings us
full circle to the girl.

232
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,410
They met at a lounge
in Södermalm

233
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:50,080
when Erick bought her
a drink after her set.

234
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,790
They spoke till dawn about
her love of music,

235
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,620
her need to find herself, and
her dream of living in New York.

236
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,060
Eric thought she was the one

237
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,060
and invited her to move into
his Lower East Side loft.

238
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,700
But the honeymoon ended fast

239
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,030
when they actually got
to know each other.

240
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,900
That's when he tossed her out.

241
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,000
For his own sense of closure,

242
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,740
he decided to delete her
from his "friend list."

243
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,910
But by then,
we were already directly linked.

244
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,110
And she was standing right next
to me in my apartment.

245
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,720
Is this fucking real?

246
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,650
No.

247
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,860
Bullshit,
because I know these guys.

248
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,720
It's none of your business, OK?

249
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,760
What the fuck.

250
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,860
- Who is it?
- Angel.

251
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,560
Fuck.

252
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,630
Who is it?

253
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:39,730
It's the fucking brother
of the dead guy on your phone.

254
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,470
Do they think I'm involved?

255
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't even know the guy!

256
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,410
What am I going to do?

257
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,670
Hold on one second, man!

258
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,940
How...?
What are we going to do?

259
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,580
We?

260
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,440
You have to help me now, OK?

261
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,050
You have to help me.

262
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,020
Yo. What up? What up?

263
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,390
What took you so damn long, man?

264
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,690
My bad, my bad.

265
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,400
It's good.

266
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,540
Smells like sex in here.

267
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,170
You got a broad in here, man?

268
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,110
I thought I heard
a woman voice in here.

269
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,040
No, just me, how the hell
you'd get in the building?

270
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,180
Sure you're not having sex?

271
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,480
Hey, you better be
wearing protection.

272
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,380
There is a lot of shit out
there, man, you're a dirty bird.

273
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,750
You're dirty fucking bird.

274
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,750
Angel.

275
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,050
How you doing, man?

276
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,890
- Surviving.
- Surviving?

277
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:38,930
Surviving.

278
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,060
Why you surviving when
you can be living, man.

279
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,460
Yo, you and I should
get back in business.

280
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,570
August...
Those were good times...

281
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,800
I told you I'm done
with that shit, man.

282
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,140
And how you making ends meet?

283
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,070
This is past due, right?

284
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,540
Nosey motherfucker.

285
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,540
This one too, man.

286
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,850
You motherfucker, like yo...

287
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,580
I don't need you coming up here
and reminding me about this
shit!

288
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,590
I know you're not here to talk
about business, so what's up?

289
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,120
- Straight to the point?
- Straight to the point.

290
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,730
I have some questions
about Jésus.

291
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,100
First, I gotta go take a piss .

292
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,960
Yo, Sparky, what you got?

293
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,590
Yeah, who's that nigga
that saw him?

294
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,770
Alright, I'll be there
in a minute.

295
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,470
Everything alright?

296
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,470
Jésus has been ghost.

297
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,540
We got a lead,
so I'm gonna go check it out.

298
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,710
If you hear anything,
let me know, right?

299
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,550
- Yeah.
- Right?

300
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Yeah.

301
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,850
I'm gonna be the first one
to kick his ass

302
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,520
before my grandma gets to him.

303
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,860
- Bye.
- Bye.

304
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,770
Take your guitar and get out.
You gotta go.

305
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,810
- Let me think for a moment.
- No thinking.

306
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,680
If you want to think,
I can bring Angel back up here

307
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,010
and you can think with him.

308
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,980
Be careful with that!
It's important to me.

309
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,010
OK.

310
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,650
Right.

311
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,650
OK.

312
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,620
I'm asking you please
to leave my apartment.

313
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:50,920
Please.

314
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,390
What did you tell him?

315
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,430
Nothing.

316
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,000
I didn't tell him nothing.

317
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,400
OK, just let me explain, right?

318
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,540
I was broke.

319
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,510
This guy talked really rich...

320
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,740
I thought I'd go with him
and if things go right,

321
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,410
I'd have a place to stay
and I can figure things out.

322
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,920
So we're doing cocaine
and we had fun.

323
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:22,790
And all of the sudden,
this friend-dealer shows up...

324
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:27,690
And all I remember is that we
were high out of our minds
and...

325
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,460
Then they started to argue.

326
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,570
Arguing about what?

327
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,400
Arguing about
who's going to fuck me first.

328
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,600
I freaked out!

329
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,740
I ran, I hid in the closet.

330
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,740
All I remember,

331
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,840
I was holding my camera
watching Jésus getting murdered.

332
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,920
I wanted to help him but I knew
I'm gonna get killed next.

333
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,890
So I ran out, I called all
the numbers in my phone.

334
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:57,690
I don't know why, out of all the
people, it had to be you!

335
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,760
This is my fucking life.

336
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,660
Shit always happens to me,
but no...

337
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,400
No, not this time.

338
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,430
If you need help,
you need to go to the cops.

339
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:10,070
No! I can't go to the police,
I don't trust the police!

340
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,100
By the way,
that guy is fucking nuts!

341
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,410
And he said his father
is powerful and rich!

342
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,790
You said
you know this Nicholas, right?

343
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,760
Yeah, yeah...

344
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,490
He's a fucker,

345
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,500
I'd have a job right now
if it wasn't for him.

346
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,000
He is a fucker.

347
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,540
August, we have the phone
and the video.

348
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,840
And he might want it...

349
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,940
He might even need it back.

350
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
OK?

351
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,640
Why don't you talk to him?

352
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,150
What do you mean "talk to him"?

353
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,620
Signe?

354
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,160
What do you mean "talk to him"?

355
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,860
What I mean is,

356
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,460
you seem like you need help.

357
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,560
So you either kick me out,

358
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,500
or you talk to him,

359
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,130
and we all get
what we really need.

360
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,440
- Fucking Christ.
- August.

361
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,810
I need some air and some food.

362
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,680
Hey...

363
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,820
How do I know you won't
just walk out and turn me in?

364
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,080
You don't.

365
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,150
If Angel came to talk to me,

366
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:35,090
that means he's talked
to everyone else on the block.

367
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,160
You're probably already fucked.

368
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,890
If he finds out I hid you here,
I'm fucked.

369
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,760
If he finds out I lied about
his brother, I'm super-fucked!

370
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,930
So as far as I'm concerned,

371
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,470
your sense of security doesn't
mean shit to me right now.

372
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,000
I didn't trust her.

373
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,810
What were the odds our fates
would cross this way?

374
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,010
That lead me to how
my money trouble started.

375
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,480
The guy's a better quarterback
his brother Patton.

376
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,510
Do you even watch football?

377
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,750
No, I think
he's better quarterback.

378
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,020
Fucking retard....

379
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,630
If was just community service I
got for sucker-punching a
yuppie,

380
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,900
it would have been one thing.

381
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,100
It was a civil settlement that
really screwed me over.

382
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,870
Motherfucker!

383
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,470
I don't usually go Mohammed Ali
over stuff like that.

384
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,170
But that night I was
totally hammered

385
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,540
cause I was still upset by what
happened earlier that day.

386
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,750
Yo, where you at?

387
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,920
I just parked on Ave C.

388
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:40,890
Hurry up!

389
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,790
What's going on, B?

390
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:50,130
You know these windows
are illegally tinted, right?

391
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,430
Officer, I've been driving
for a year like this...

392
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,800
License, registration
and get out of the car.

393
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,970
Bingo.

394
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,510
Whoops.

395
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:02,840
Sugar for your coffee?

396
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,410
Turn around,
put your hands behind you back.

397
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,780
Jesus and I barely spoke
since his arrest.

398
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,850
Felt so guilty that
he got busted and I went free,

399
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,820
I got trashed just to get it
out of my head.

400
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,460
That lead
to punching the yuppie,

401
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,790
as the more I got wasted,

402
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:24,160
the deeper I drifted
into my mind.

403
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,940
It was also that night I got the
first tremors in my hand.

404
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,940
Too broke to see a doctor.

405
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,520
All this leads to Nicholas.

406
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,690
He always made me feel
invisible.

407
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,450
No shaving...

408
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,560
Thank you, Captain.

409
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:52,390
And for the hundredth time,

410
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,990
Nicholas didn't tip.

411
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,000
Why not get even
for Jésus and myself?

412
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,800
After all, it's partly my fault
that Jésus was dead

413
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:04,770
since I introduced Nicholas to
him to score drugs in the first
place.

414
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,440
- You still got my number.
right? - Yeah, yeah.

415
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,110
Pick up the water, too.

416
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:20,950
What the fuck are you doing?

417
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:23,990
The one time August retaliated,
I got fired.

418
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,390
That's when I remembered what
Jésus said to me once:

419
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,960
In life,
you either fuck or get fucked.

420
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,660
Make sure it's you
doing the fucking.

421
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,600
So even if I didn't trust her,

422
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:36,000
why not screw Nicholas
for 50 grand anyway?

423
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:15,740
So, you're just gonna go?

424
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,450
If you don't want me here,
I'll find my own way.

425
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,420
So what do you think?

426
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,060
Let's talk to him.

427
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,740
Nicholas wasn't all bad.

428
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,050
But to understand him
meant knowing his history.

429
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,910
His life had always been tied
to Wall Street

430
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,620
because his father, Charles,

431
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,750
created Feinman Securities in
1965.

432
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:02,520
Charles was one of the guys
who founded the NASDAQ

433
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,490
and revolutionized
the world of finance.

434
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:09,630
His maxed his profits by serving
only the most elite clients.

435
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:20,440
And by the 80s, Charles handled
18% of transactions on Wall
Street,

436
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:24,440
until he was hit hard
in the '87 stock market crash.

437
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,430
Feinman couldn't let this happen
again in the recession of the
90s,

438
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,100
so he created a formula to
provide

439
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,530
huge returns
on his clients' investments.

440
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:48,870
But he really stashed their
money into his own bank accounts

441
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,770
while giving them reports
of huge gains.

442
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:55,410
Soon he had billions in play,

443
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,910
but with the most
recent market crash,

444
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,880
investors rushed to cash out,

445
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:02,680
finding that he couldn't pay
back money that no longer
existed.

446
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,060
Charles' one and only obssesion
was the company,

447
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,430
at the cost of other
relationships,

448
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,030
including with his son,
Nicholas.

449
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,040
Nicholas lost touch with his
father during his years at
Princeton,

450
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,040
got tired of being
second to the company.

451
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,040
But after college, his desire
for his father's approval

452
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,910
drove him to Wharton Business
School and back into the family
business.

453
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:42,760
I realize now that Nicholas was
just as lost as I was.

454
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:47,830
All that money and privilege
could never replace the love of
a father.

455
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,930
Nicholas' most prized possession
was his violin.

456
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,900
Playing it was the only thing
that made him feel at ease.

457
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,710
But on that day, it couldn't
ease the guilt he felt

458
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,950
after what happened to Jésus.

459
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:57,700
She always thought fate
would bring her to New York.

460
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:04,600
She ran away to Stockholm from
her hometown of Skane at
seventeen.

461
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:10,110
Though her parents loved her,
she felt they never understood
her.

462
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,010
And Skane was too ordinary.

463
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,580
She can never be ordinary.

464
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,020
All she had was her music.

465
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,160
She got her first guitar as a
gift from her dad at thirteen.

466
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:26,560
She loved it so much that
she practiced non-stop.

467
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,860
In Stockholm, it wasn't much
better than Skane though.

468
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,860
She never found
her place there either.

469
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,500
She had to do things to make
money to pursue her music,

470
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,600
things she was
unable to confront.

471
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,000
Then she start running again.

472
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,040
And now in New York,
she still felt alone.

473
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,940
She joked once that even though
she had 221 friends

474
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,680
on her online profile,

475
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,850
there were still no one
to eat dinner with.

476
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,750
You can't live here
for free anymore, OK?

477
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,720
Fuck the music shit!

478
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:56,120
You know I can't work.
I'm looking for gigs.

479
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,660
You got two weeks to move out!

480
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:02,560
And now that I got a girl here,
you're shit out of luck, OK?

481
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,770
She didn't want
to be hurt anymore.

482
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,840
And she was tired of running.

483
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,570
She felt like no matter
what she did,

484
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,140
she couldn't escape that feeling
she had since she was seventeen.

485
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,180
There was no place for her
in the world.

486
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,750
Somehow, as unlikely as it
seemed, we became connected.

487
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:33,690
I ripped my pants.
Can you turn round?

488
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:35,590
Cover your eyes.

489
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,630
- Can I help you?
- No, it's OK, I got it.

490
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,970
No, just give it to me.
Let me help you.

491
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,040
- No, it's OK...
- No, it's OK, trust me.

492
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:45,540
I used to sew my own dresses
when I was a little girl.

493
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,740
So, anyway...

494
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,850
I talked to a few people that I
used to work with, and
apparently

495
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,480
this guy is a lot more loaded
than we thought.

496
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,050
His dad owns
some big securities firm.

497
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,450
I knew it.

498
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:03,420
You sure there's nothing else
you remember from that night?

499
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,990
I told you I'm trying to
block...

500
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,460
those memories from my mind.

501
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,860
All I can remember is blood.

502
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,900
If we're gonna do this,
you have to remember, OK?

503
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,770
What about before
you got to his place?

504
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,840
Anything he said?
Anything that happened?

505
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,740
We got very drunk at the bar.

506
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:28,850
I don't think he had cash
because he used his card for the
taxi.

507
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:31,920
Yeah...

508
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:35,420
Before we got into the taxi
though, he called Jésus.

509
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,560
C'mon...

510
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,630
What about on the way there?

511
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,630
No, we just talked.

512
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,100
He said he loved music.

513
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:47,830
He plays violin.

514
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,430
Yeah, what else did he say?

515
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,000
I don't know...

516
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,410
I told him about Sweden.

517
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,040
He talked about New York.

518
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,480
We drove past a museum.

519
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,110
He said his family helped make
the Lower East Side what it is.

520
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,020
That they still contribute
to the museum.

521
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
Take a note to ask...

522
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,620
Hey, thanks for the clothes,

523
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,530
and letting me stay.

524
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,500
Yeah...

525
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,670
Yeah, you're welcome.

526
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,700
OK, here we go.

527
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,810
Great.

528
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,780
You keep on
checking out the window.

529
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,820
Yeah...

530
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,080
I'm two months behind
on my rent.

531
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,390
I gotta make sure my landlord
doesn't ambush me.

532
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,060
Oh, sorry but...

533
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,430
Yeah, thanks for...

534
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,630
...stitching my...

535
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,000
Yeah.

536
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:10,550
Now, what's so urgent about a
coat check girl you're banging?

537
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,050
This guy who's harassing her is
some fucking security big-wig.

538
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:16,660
And the manager, the owners,
want me to look into it.

539
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,760
What's it have to do with me?

540
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,930
I figured anybody know anything
about these finance guys,

541
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:20,890
it'd be you,

542
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,790
Mr. Investigative Reporter.

543
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,900
Look, August, I don't have time

544
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,530
to chase some guy
who's screwing your girl?

545
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,130
Indy, don't do this, c'mon!

546
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,110
Who used to hook you up
back at Rutgers?

547
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,540
I mean who helped you lose
your fucking virginity?

548
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,080
She was a hooker,

549
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,750
and you lied that
she was a transfer student!

550
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:43,450
- She put some hair on that
chest. - I was born with hair on
my chest!

551
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,490
I'm gonna help you out,

552
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,150
but you gotta give me
more to go on.

553
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,590
Anything on the father?

554
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:54,590
All I got is the son, Nicholas,
tall, white, pretty boy.

555
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,100
Oh, that's great. Tall, white,
pretty boy named Nicholas?

556
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:59,560
That will really
narrow it down for me.

557
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,630
Is he WASP,
or one of the chosen?

558
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,940
I dunno. Apparently he said
something about

559
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,540
his father being the reason
Lower East Side what it is,

560
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:09,470
bragging to her about
contributing to some old museum.

561
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:12,680
If it's in the Lower East, it's
probably the Tenement Museum.

562
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,880
That's a start. At least, I'll
check out their donor records.

563
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,680
Oh shit, man,
I gotta pick up my daughter.

564
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,150
- Call you when I get a hint?
- Thank you.

565
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,120
Alright, brother,
in the meantime,

566
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,720
why don't you go home
and see if you can

567
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,390
keep your girl from fucking
this guy for a few hours.

568
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,670
Signe?

569
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,610
Signe?

570
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:05,500
Yo, nix that shit, man! I can't
stand that fuckin' dancehall.

571
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,870
Nigga, dancehall
can't stand you either, boy.

572
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,940
What's up Raul, José?

573
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,440
Wazzup, man.

574
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,940
Except we're waiting for
these punk-ass bitches

575
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,480
to finish their game.

576
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:20,580
Sparky said you all was with
Jésus last night?

577
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,750
Supposed to hit this spot
that was the jump off,

578
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,020
all of a sudden that nigga
just peaced out.

579
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,750
But he said
he was supposed to meet us

580
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,720
at the courts today though,
so...

581
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,060
Did he say where he was going?

582
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,390
Nah, he just split.

583
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,860
He said something about Ludlow,

584
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,600
but I don't fuck around
there no more, yo,

585
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:40,070
I ain't tryin' to fuck with none
of these white bitches no more,
yo.

586
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,770
You tell Jésus,

587
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,570
if you see him,
that Angel's looking for him.

588
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,770
No doubt, man.

589
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,980
I always felt a bond with Angel.

590
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,550
Our parents had brought us
here for a better future.

591
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,850
We were part of a history that
stretched all the way back

592
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,380
to the 19th century...

593
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,750
That's when the first free
African-American slaves

594
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,050
made their homes in this place.

595
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,860
There were joined
by waves of Irish.

596
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:10,530
By the 1870s, more that 170,000
Germans became the next wave.

597
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,870
The Germans and Irish were
joined in the Lower East Side

598
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,870
by the Italians.

599
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,870
By the early 1900s,

600
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,510
the European Jews found
their home in the LES.

601
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,580
Among them was Herschel Feinman,
great-grandfather of Nicholas.

602
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,380
No, if I see him, I'll tell you.

603
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,090
...suffer! You don't understand,
this is my house!

604
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:36,990
Shut the fuck up!

605
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:40,160
Jésus, Jésus!
You saw him! Jésus!

606
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,980
The most recent immigrants
were Chinese,

607
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,110
Puerto Rican and Dominican,

608
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,050
including Luz Guzman
and her two sons,

609
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,390
Jésus

610
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,590
and Angel.

611
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,460
Yo, I was just about
to call you, man.

612
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,760
I called you yesterday, all day.

613
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,830
Yo man, it was my day off.

614
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:24,070
- Where's Jésus?
- Haven't seen him.

615
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,910
He left a message
on his computer,

616
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,670
like maybe he was doing
some business Saturday night.

617
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,710
You point anyone his way?

618
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:34,410
I might have supplied a number
to an overeager customer.

619
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,980
Ain't fucking around, Dre.

620
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,620
All I know is his name
is Nicholas.

621
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,680
Nicholas what?

622
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,990
Nicholas "I need some coke
right now cuz I got some

623
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,490
"horny pussy
that needs to be fucked."

624
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,760
I didn't get
his full government name.

625
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:51,400
Hey look, go talk
to this girl named Maria,

626
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,130
fine-ass bartender
across the street at Piano.

627
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,870
She usually gets in
around about 7.

628
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,040
I heard the two of them
smashed once.

629
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,040
Everything changed for Angel

630
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,740
after what happened
during those days.

631
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:06,010
And I can't fully blame him
for what he felt he had to do.

632
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,640
Maria?

633
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,810
Maria, can I talk to you
for a minute?

634
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,840
About what?

635
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,680
A guy named Nicholas...

636
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,480
You met him at The Void,
he took you home.

637
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,910
Is he a friend of yours?

638
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,150
- Cuz that guy's a fuckin' dick.
- I know he is.

639
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,090
That's why
I want to talk to you.

640
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,920
What happened with you two?

641
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,660
He takes me home,

642
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,830
tries to force me
to fuck him without a condom,

643
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,060
I tell him no way,
then he wants to go anal,

644
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,100
I tell him I'm not so much
into anal anymore,

645
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,900
and then he kicks me out.

646
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,510
You don't hold back
on your details, do you?

647
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,910
No, I don't fuck around.

648
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:14,110
Or are you the type who
likes to beat around the bush?

649
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,580
Nah...

650
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,380
I get straight to the point.

651
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,950
See, Nicholas,
he ain't a friend of mine.

652
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,950
In fact, he did something
similar to someone who is.

653
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,090
Remember where he lives?

654
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,560
Listen, just cuz I don't
fuck around

655
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,860
doesn't mean I want any trouble.

656
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,800
You ain't gotta worry
your pretty little face.

657
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,470
I'm just wanna talk
some sense into him.

658
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,710
See, all you gotta do...

659
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,770
is point out the building,

660
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:44,580
that's all you gotta do.

661
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,170
Where did you go?

662
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,700
Hi.

663
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,700
Just for a walk.

664
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,110
I've been stuck in this place
for two days.

665
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,670
I don't like feeling trapped.

666
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:17,610
Don't leave the apartment again.

667
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,580
It's such a pretty day.

668
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:21,910
OK...

669
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,720
- Say no more, I get it.
- No, you don't get it.

670
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,990
We have to protect ourselves,
and you just running off...

671
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,820
Look, it just gives me
a bad feeling,

672
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,990
so don't do it, OK?

673
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,620
Am I a prisoner?

674
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,160
Who'll connect anything?

675
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,460
I don't think
we should be so paranoid.

676
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,930
Or is that bad feeling
from something else?

677
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,070
I saw all those horoscopes.

678
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,710
That's no way
to live life, August.

679
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,440
You can't cheat what's coming.

680
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,510
Don't go through my shit.

681
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,750
Oh, did I touch some sore spot?

682
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:58,950
Was that a love horoscope?

683
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:01,690
Are you trying to keep me here
just for yourself?

684
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:05,920
Lemme make something
crystal clear to you, OK?

685
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,390
You're here because you need me.

686
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:12,130
I'm letting you stay here
because I need money.

687
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,000
You equal money.

688
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:15,470
That's it.

689
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,730
Get it?

690
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,540
Just because
you fuck your way into

691
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,940
whatever you want
with others guys,

692
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,810
don't come here and try
that slutty shit with me

693
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,010
cause it's not gonna work.

694
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:42,930
- It was just a joke, August.
- Ha, ha...

695
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,500
Since you know me so well,

696
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:48,530
why did you let me fuck my way
into here two nights ago?

697
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,970
To be honest with you...

698
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,010
I kind of felt sorry for you.

699
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,140
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

700
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,110
Then why don't you
forget everything then

701
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:00,080
and just feel sorry for me
a bit longer?

702
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,480
Just a bit longer? Alright?

703
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:06,650
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

704
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,490
August, there are things about
me you'll never understand.

705
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,560
So don't you ever talk to me

706
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:17,730
like I'm just a
stupid, pathetic whore?

707
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,840
Hello.

708
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,010
Hey, hi Indran, yeah.

709
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,380
No, I'm fine, OK.

710
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:41,120
Thank you, thank you.

711
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:42,790
Yeah.

712
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:47,860
What?

713
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,960
Nicholas Feinman.

714
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,100
Now we know where he lives.

715
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:04,140
I dunno,
I was pretty wasted by then.

716
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,840
You can't remember
anything specific?

717
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,520
What did he try with your girl?

718
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:15,750
It was a guy.

719
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,990
Ohhh...

720
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:20,890
Didn't know he was a swinger.

721
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,630
There it is.

722
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,700
That's the one.

723
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:36,840
Take this number.

724
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,540
If you need anything,

725
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,450
anything at all,
let me know.

726
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:43,550
Alright?

727
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,050
Here...

728
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:48,120
Get yourself a cab.

729
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,020
Thanks, Babe.

730
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:55,590
I'll call you.

731
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,610
There's your favorite loverboy,
right there.

732
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:27,990
Nicholas?

733
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,530
You're Nicholas Feinman?

734
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,560
Yeah, what do you want?

735
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,440
Where the fuck is my brother?

736
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,080
Put the gun away and I'll tell
you.

737
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,150
He's dead.

738
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,720
I didn't do it.

739
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,890
I swear.

740
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:36,390
Really?

741
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,470
I'm very sorry for your loss.

742
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:49,010
What the fuck happened?

743
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,410
He was shot,

744
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:52,880
right where you're sitting,
with his own gun.

745
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,950
We had this girl here,
I met her at The Void.

746
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:55,810
You know The Void?

747
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,450
I know The Void.
Spit it out!

748
00:45:58,350 --> 00:45:59,820
So I meet her there,
bring her home,

749
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:02,550
Jésus comes over and
we're all doing blow.

750
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:06,090
I said wait for a second and
then she went fucking crazy.

751
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,430
Shot Jésus.

752
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:10,030
I swear.

753
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:14,830
And his body?

754
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,430
I don't know,
I called my father and

755
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,070
- ...he cleaned it up.
- Clean it up!

756
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,440
Huh?

757
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,640
He's a piece of garbage!

758
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,110
Don't you ever talk about
my brother like that again.

759
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,440
Got it?

760
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,850
You're gonna call your Daddy

761
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,120
and get my brother's body back.

762
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,790
- Got it?
- I got it.

763
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:36,850
I'm sorry, sorry.

764
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,790
Look, it was a tragedy,

765
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:42,160
your brother was a dealer.

766
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:45,460
This could cause more
trouble for you, me.

767
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,530
Your family, my family,
who knows?

768
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,940
But I can help you find her.

769
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:58,680
Open it.

770
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,080
Why should I trust
you're telling the truth?

771
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,010
Why shouldn't
I just blast your ass right now?

772
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,020
You could,
but you wouldn't get far.

773
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,850
Your face is
on the cameras in the lobby,

774
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,420
the doorman could pick you
from a lineup.

775
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,490
No offense, but if something
happens to someone like me,

776
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:13,660
it's not the same.

777
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:14,660
Trust me.

778
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:18,830
Besides, why would I
steal her wallet for fun?

779
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,160
The money?

780
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,970
Now Yuri, I told you I was...

781
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,580
My brother...

782
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:38,580
Well, how long
do you need me for?

783
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:42,550
Fuck!

784
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:51,660
That's the girl
who killed your brother.

785
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:15,690
Hello?

786
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,020
It's me.

787
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,160
We got another problem.

788
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:23,530
The brother of the dead guy.

789
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:28,130
Can you get rid of him?

790
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:39,680
Right.

791
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,610
Have you seen this chick?

792
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:44,080
With that Nicholas dude?

793
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:48,590
Dre, take a closer look, man.

794
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:51,690
Imagine it was your brother,
man.

795
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:55,630
What if Twan went missing
just like that?

796
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:58,860
Twan's twice as big as my ass,
he ain't disappearing nowhere.

797
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,470
Dre,
Jésus didn't just disappear.

798
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:04,940
He's dead.

799
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,140
And I need to find who
was responsible for this shit.

800
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:11,080
Damn, man, I'm sorry,

801
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,610
I didn't know it was like that.
You alright?

802
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:14,710
Nah, man.

803
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,080
I ain't...

804
00:49:17,950 --> 00:49:19,650
Cause when Jésus
came outta jail,

805
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,890
he went crazy in the head, man.

806
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,560
And I told his ass,
if I catch you dealing,

807
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:27,430
I'm gonna kill you.

808
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:31,030
Can you believe that shit?

809
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,630
The last thing
I said to my brother...

810
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,100
I'm gonna kill you.

811
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,700
Look, I got a system with
the IDs alright?

812
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:42,570
Just like I got a photographic
memory or something,

813
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:46,410
so if I've seen them,
I'd know it, that's the truth.

814
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:47,650
Alright.

815
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,620
If you see she her come through,
you let me know.

816
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:55,650
Of course, man, I'm on it.

817
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:57,890
Photographic memory, baby.

818
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,080
- Hey.
- Hey.

819
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,810
I'll see you soon, alright?

820
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:24,050
Hey, life with kids'll kill you.

821
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,880
Good to see you boss. I think
this package is for Mr. Feinman.

822
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,420
- You said Feinman, right?
- Yeah.

823
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:29,720
Mind taking this up?

824
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,690
For you?
Of course, no problem.

825
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,160
Thank you, boss.

826
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,610
Why'd you clean up the place?

827
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:35,750
Look...

828
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,060
I'm sorry about what I said.

829
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:42,430
It was wrong.

830
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,070
And whoever you choose to fuck
is your business, but...

831
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,100
The whole
knife-in-the-eye thing...

832
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:54,610
Really?

833
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:58,580
It's a bit crazy though, right?

834
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:03,380
I used to see
lots of different men.

835
00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:06,720
Old rich men
that took care of me.

836
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:14,020
One of them found out that
he was not the only one

837
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,390
and got jealous.

838
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:18,530
He locked me in his bedroom
for a week.

839
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,600
That's why I hate
being locked in places.

840
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:22,700
What happened to the man?

841
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,870
I started a fire to get out.

842
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:32,780
Then he went to the police

843
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:35,480
and said I tried
to burn him alive.

844
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:39,720
So now I can't go back to Sweden
because I go to jail.

845
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,790
What did you get on Angel?

846
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,530
Angel Guzman...

847
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:51,160
Lower-level dealer
for the Russians,

848
00:52:51,730 --> 00:52:54,430
helps move supply
in the Lower East.

849
00:52:54,970 --> 00:52:56,770
I found his pick-up spot,

850
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,640
and I'm gonna pay him
a visit in the morning.

851
00:52:58,770 --> 00:53:00,470
Good, stay on him,

852
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,040
Get rid of him!

853
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:03,970
I'll deal with amateur hour.

854
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,840
What did you get on the girl?

855
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,880
Wait till you
get a load of this.

856
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,620
How am I supposed to know
any of this is true?

857
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,060
Why would I lie
about something like that?

858
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,700
Why are you so paranoid, August?

859
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,840
I think a saw a cop

860
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:36,510
when I went
to drop the package off.

861
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:41,880
That's why.

862
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:45,680
Wait.

863
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,450
Are you pulling out?

864
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:50,790
Look, my life
over the past few years

865
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,690
hasn't been so lucky.

866
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,730
Now I'm not saying I'm innocent,

867
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:57,460
and everything,
but time is just...

868
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:02,600
just passing me by and
I'm trying to play catch up.

869
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,140
Now, from this fucking cop,

870
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:06,800
to these fucking rich kids

871
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,470
that just come down here like
they fuckin' own the place.

872
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:12,810
No, August...

873
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,980
They don't own us.

874
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:16,950
Hey.

875
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,700
Yeah.

876
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:38,940
Let's go somewhere.

877
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,510
- Right.
- Let's do something.

878
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:44,910
What you do want to do?

879
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,650
They don't own us.

880
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:52,720
Those words
remind me of possibility.

881
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:56,520
One of the hardest things
to confront is realizing

882
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,790
you might never be everything
you thought you would.

883
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,730
It's not like we were in love,

884
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,960
we both knew
that we were barely friends.

885
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:09,030
In those moments, everything
felt possible again.

886
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:15,770
You look good.

887
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:18,840
You look good, too.

888
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:22,780
Thanks again for
cleaning up the place today.

889
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,750
Hmmm, you're vibrating again.

890
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,860
You the one
who left the picture?

891
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,770
Yeah. I'm the one.

892
00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:44,030
Is that fucking cunt with you?

893
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:47,540
- The only cunt here is your
mother. - Oh.

894
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:49,740
You think you have balls?

895
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:52,740
OK, I'd be careful what
I say next, if I were you.

896
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:53,740
Careful?

897
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:55,650
Who the fuck are you?

898
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,620
I'm not paying you shit,
now fuck off!

899
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:03,050
That sounded like it went well.

900
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,620
He told me to be careful?

901
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,460
What a fucking poser!

902
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,160
I'll deal with this guy.

903
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:09,760
What did he say?

904
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:11,400
He told me to fuck off.

905
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,030
So what do we do now?

906
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:20,970
Hello?

907
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:22,670
Alright, dickhead...

908
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:24,170
I got an offer for you.

909
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:26,840
Hang up on me again and
I'm going straight to the cops.

910
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,550
Then you get no money.

911
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,750
Meet me at 2pm tomorrow
on the West Side.

912
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,680
No, you're not making
the rules here, guy.

913
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,490
2 pm, under
the Williamsburg Bridge.

914
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,920
Fine, guy...

915
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,720
Makes no difference...

916
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:40,660
Fuck!

917
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,730
- The guy's a fucking douchebag.
- I know.

918
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,530
But I'm gonna meet him tomorrow.

919
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:48,170
Felt kinda good.
Felt pretty good.

920
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:52,170
So tonight, we dance
because they can't trap us.

921
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,570
And we have fun, OK?

922
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:56,570
Let's just have fun.

923
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,140
- You're crazy.
- Just have fun!

924
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:45,420
Music always makes me feel
more alive than anything.

925
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,530
At moments like that,
my mind couldn't help wander...

926
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,430
About how our ancestors
must've lived on these streets,

927
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,570
and in these buildings,

928
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,100
searching for a better tomorrow.

929
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:01,670
Now here we were, searching for
our own sense of possibility,

930
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:04,640
we danced on top of our history.

931
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,620
Guess what I just saw?

932
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,640
What is it?

933
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:09,510
Shit!
I just saw Angel.

934
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:12,040
- What? Do you think he knows?
- I don't know.

935
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,610
But we're not waiting
around to find out.

936
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:17,710
Hello, yo, Amir,
I need your help.

937
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,880
Be there in 30 minutes.

938
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:38,570
Your uncle watches
television all day?

939
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:42,070
He's obsessed with watching
political news coverage.

940
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:43,140
Why?

941
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,910
Because back in Bosnia, he
didn't even have a television.

942
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:48,380
Now he considers it
his patriotic duty

943
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:50,780
as a proud American
to be informed.

944
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,750
Yo, Amir...

945
00:59:55,850 --> 00:59:57,150
I have to go back.

946
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,060
I gotta get this phone
to handle Nicholas.

947
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:00,060
What about Angel?

948
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,690
I'll play dumb, as long as
he doesn't see her with me.

949
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:04,030
He might not know anything.

950
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,000
He may just have
a few more questions.

951
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:07,530
OK, be careful.

952
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,600
Alright, man.

953
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,410
Hey August...

954
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:19,510
Yeah.

955
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:22,850
What's up?

956
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:31,790
It's just so hard to
express myself in English.

957
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,730
Say it in your language then.

958
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,390
Are you nervous?

959
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:03,520
Terrified.

960
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:31,620
I want you out
of this apartment

961
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:33,550
- No moving!
- ...by the end of this week.

962
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:44,900
What's up, man?

963
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:46,800
Long time no see...

964
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,870
Yo, walk this way,
don't try nothing stupid.

965
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,700
Across the street to the car.

966
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,170
No holding, I'm walking.

967
01:01:56,070 --> 01:01:56,910
Get in! Fuck!

968
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,540
- Hurry up man.
- I got it.

969
01:01:58,710 --> 01:02:00,110
Put the shit over him!

970
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:01,880
Fuck you want to do,
fuckin' pussy?

971
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:06,120
- Your woman, fucker!
- Shoot that nigga!

972
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:08,720
Yo, shoot that nigga!

973
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:42,750
Let up.

974
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:54,000
Where the fuck is he?

975
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:56,730
I don't know.

976
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:04,710
What the fuck
is going on, August?

977
01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:05,810
Huh?

978
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,880
Where's the girl?

979
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,080
Are you in on this shit?

980
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:15,750
I swear, I swear, no...

981
01:03:15,890 --> 01:03:17,420
I don't know him.

982
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,860
I didn't know the girl
before I met her.

983
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:20,690
You're gonna say shit to me?

984
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:22,590
She begged for my help.

985
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:25,060
I swear to you I didn't know
about Jésus until later.

986
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,730
- You lied straight to my face.
- What was I supposed to say?

987
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:31,170
What was I supposed
to fucking say?

988
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,170
I swear,
you'd think I was involved.

989
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:33,970
You're supposed to say,

990
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:36,640
"Hey Angel, here's the bitch
that killed your brother!"

991
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:38,740
What are you talking about?

992
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:40,480
She didn't kill Jésus.

993
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:41,550
Bullshit!

994
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:43,150
Bullshit!

995
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,450
You keep trying to protect her,

996
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:48,790
I'm going to kill you,

997
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:51,720
just like I killed
that motherfucker.

998
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:54,160
Strike one, August.

999
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:00,700
I take no pleasure in this.

1000
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,600
Choke his ass out.

1001
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:31,160
She was the one
at your house, huh?

1002
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:33,530
Yeah.

1003
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:34,830
I knew it.

1004
01:04:35,870 --> 01:04:38,070
And don't tell me
I didn't smell that shit..

1005
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,070
And you was acting funny too.

1006
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:43,710
What the fuck was she doing
at your house, August?

1007
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,010
- We met at Void.
- What?

1008
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:48,480
We met at Void.

1009
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:51,580
She called me
late night for drink.

1010
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,750
I figured it was a booty call.

1011
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,520
I swear on my life

1012
01:04:56,990 --> 01:04:58,920
I didn't know about Jésus.

1013
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:02,760
And I know there is no way,
there's no way...

1014
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:06,760
Strike two!

1015
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,600
You and I,
we can square our business.

1016
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:15,510
But first...

1017
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:17,610
I want that fucking girl.

1018
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,650
OK. OK.

1019
01:05:21,780 --> 01:05:22,810
OK.

1020
01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:26,880
But you gotta do it my way.

1021
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:27,620
Your way?

1022
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,790
Go on, go on...

1023
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:32,520
Fucking be smart here
for a second.

1024
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:35,560
If I go back looking like this,
she's gonna know something's up,

1025
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:37,790
and you know
I ain't good at faking.

1026
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:40,100
Angel...

1027
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,500
You saw right through me
the other day.

1028
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:46,440
I'm sorry...

1029
01:05:49,010 --> 01:05:50,140
Sorry.

1030
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,440
August,

1031
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:58,520
I swear to you by everything
that is sacred to me,

1032
01:06:02,490 --> 01:06:03,850
if you fuck me...

1033
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:33,050
Open the glove compartment
and read the paper.

1034
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:46,560
What does this mean?

1035
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,470
It means there's no money.

1036
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,400
Feinman Securities is over,

1037
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,070
busted by the SCC.

1038
01:06:53,770 --> 01:06:55,540
Daddy's going to jail.

1039
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:00,740
OK...

1040
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:02,680
OK, you know what?

1041
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:04,650
You gonna find a way
to give me that money,

1042
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,750
or you can look forward
to spending quality bonding time

1043
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,450
with him in lock-up.

1044
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:11,720
Wait!
You cocksucker...

1045
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:13,420
Look, here's the deal:

1046
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:15,860
I got assets of my own,
but I can't touch them.

1047
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:16,890
Not until this blows over.

1048
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,630
I'm supposed to believe
a cold-blooded murderer

1049
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,160
whose father is a fucking thief?

1050
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:23,000
I didn't mean to kill anyone!

1051
01:07:23,900 --> 01:07:24,870
OK?

1052
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,540
And I'm nothing
like my father, got that?

1053
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,440
When he's gone, I'm gonna start
things over legitimately,

1054
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:32,980
alright?

1055
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:36,750
Just do me a favor,
before you call me a murderer,

1056
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:38,450
ask that girl about why
she left Sweden?

1057
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:41,020
I know all about the fire,
it's not what you think.

1058
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:43,790
What the fuck are you talking
about? There's no fire!

1059
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:46,120
I had my people
dig into her past.

1060
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:49,530
First, records show that her
photo is an identical match to

1061
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:52,100
a woman wanted for
attempted murder in Stockholm.

1062
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:54,460
She almost stabbed a man to
death.

1063
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:59,040
Second, there is no one with her
name from her hometown in
Sweden.

1064
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:00,040
Third...

1065
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:01,700
Did you ever stop to ask

1066
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,940
how the dead guy on her phone
got covered in blood?

1067
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:08,080
You have no idea
who she even really is.

1068
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:11,750
So go check her passport,
you fucking amateur!

1069
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:15,590
You think you can trust anything
a girl like that says?

1070
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,150
She'll suck you off at night,

1071
01:08:17,490 --> 01:08:19,120
and then fuck you over
in the morning.

1072
01:08:21,830 --> 01:08:23,690
Take that and open it up.

1073
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,130
What the fuck am I supposed
to do with $500?

1074
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:31,870
An advance.

1075
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,170
You're out of your mind if you
think I'd give you fifty grand.

1076
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:35,940
But here's the deal.

1077
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:37,510
Kill the girl,

1078
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,780
and I'll give you five grand.

1079
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,080
Kill the girl.

1080
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:43,880
- You're kidding, right?
- No...

1081
01:08:44,010 --> 01:08:47,050
That fucking bitch
really pissed me off.

1082
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:50,950
No one gets away
with what she did.

1083
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,560
So...

1084
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:54,560
I'll give you
another five grand,

1085
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:56,530
if you destroy every copy
of that footage,

1086
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:59,460
and bring me her phone with
a new video of her dead body.

1087
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,060
Nah, nah...

1088
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:04,730
- Can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

1089
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,000
Just keep saying that
to yourself, OK?

1090
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,740
"Yes I can."

1091
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:11,570
Five to kill,

1092
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,710
five for the phone.

1093
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:25,090
Jésus, what happened?

1094
01:09:31,330 --> 01:09:33,460
- Did you get the money?
- There is no money.

1095
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,630
- What do you mean...?
- There is no fucking money!

1096
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:39,170
And specially not for you!

1097
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:43,470
Why was Jésus covered in blood
on the video?

1098
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:44,940
Why are you asking me this?

1099
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:48,650
Why the fuck was Jésus covered
in blood in the video?

1100
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:49,950
Before Feinman suffocated him?

1101
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:51,450
I told you they were arguing

1102
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:53,480
who was going to sleep
with me first, and then...

1103
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,420
- Then what?
- The gun was on the couch...

1104
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:56,450
- And what?
- Jésus and Nicholas...

1105
01:09:56,590 --> 01:09:58,050
And you murdered him.

1106
01:09:58,390 --> 01:09:59,560
Jesus fucking Christ!

1107
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:00,620
You murdered him.

1108
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:04,660
You shot a guy and then used
somebody else to clean up your
mess,

1109
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,160
just like you did in Sweden,
and now you're playing me.

1110
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,670
That's not true, August!

1111
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,470
- Let me see your passport.
- What?

1112
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,740
Let me see your fuckin'
passport. I want to know your
real name.

1113
01:10:12,870 --> 01:10:15,670
- You know my real name.
- You're full of shit.

1114
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:17,540
Come with me,
we're going for a ride.

1115
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:18,940
I'm not going anywhere with you,
not like this!

1116
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:20,510
You don't have a choice.

1117
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,880
OK, what?
What are you going to do?

1118
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:27,580
You're gonna shoot me?

1119
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:30,850
Gonna run me,
you gonna stab me and run away?

1120
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:36,630
I was protecting myself, OK?

1121
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:39,060
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

1122
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:41,660
- You have to believe me...
- No!

1123
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:42,930
No.

1124
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:45,970
Fuck...

1125
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,040
I'm so fuckin' stupid,
cause I knew it.

1126
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:53,110
I knew it, you basically
prostitute yourself to rich
guys,

1127
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:56,050
and then claim they locked
you up, or they raped you, or

1128
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,680
whatever fuckin' story
you make up!

1129
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,580
You think you can get away
with it cause you're just a

1130
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:01,780
pretty, little blond girl?

1131
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:07,560
With women like you in the
world, there's no such thing as
rape.

1132
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:08,930
It's just another
four-letter word.

1133
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:10,530
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1134
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:12,800
OK! Fuck you! Fuck you!

1135
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:14,660
Fuck you! Fuck you!

1136
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:29,580
Come on.

1137
01:11:56,810 --> 01:11:58,710
Sound of Signe and Nicholas
toasting.]

1138
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:24,970
Ladies first.

1139
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:45,490
Hello?

1140
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:47,820
Just tell him
you're here for me

1141
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,490
up in the penthouse.

1142
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:50,730
Yeah.

1143
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,800
Don't you think it would be

1144
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:59,540
better, just you and me?

1145
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:04,670
- Nicholas, right?
- Yeah.

1146
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:06,410
- That's right.
- What's goin' on?

1147
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:08,140
You know what?
I remember you now.

1148
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,980
We met before,
you the wild one.

1149
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:12,920
If you say so.

1150
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:14,620
- You wanna drink?
- Hmmm...

1151
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:17,620
I will have one drink man.
I'm driving.

1152
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:19,660
So don't make it too strong.

1153
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,060
Hey, how you doing?

1154
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:29,770
Hey.

1155
01:13:30,530 --> 01:13:31,800
What's your name, mama?

1156
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,770
- Signe.
- Signe?

1157
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,040
I like that.
Where's that from?

1158
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:37,640
It's European.

1159
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:39,680
- From where?
- I'm Swedish.

1160
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:41,540
Swedish, look at that.

1161
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:43,650
My name is Jésus,
and I'm Dominican.

1162
01:13:43,780 --> 01:13:46,820
Alright,
for your holiness, Jésus,

1163
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:48,420
vodka on the rocks.

1164
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:49,520
But first,

1165
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:50,850
how about a round of shots?

1166
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:52,920
You know, I'll take one shot.

1167
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:55,660
Just one, I'm driving.
I really can't get fucked up.

1168
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:56,760
Pussy?

1169
01:13:57,560 --> 01:13:58,800
- Thanks.
- Come on...

1170
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:00,530
Take off your jacket.

1171
01:14:00,660 --> 01:14:03,700
Nah, it's cool.
Just one shot.

1172
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,770
We were so high
on those mushrooms,

1173
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,170
running down the streets
of Amsterdam, butt-naked,

1174
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,110
except for a sock
covering his dick!

1175
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:18,750
My god, then he tried
to go sailing!

1176
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,650
That's stupid,
you guys are nuts, man.

1177
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:22,990
Wild! You guys are crazy.

1178
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,620
Let me hit that.

1179
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:35,430
You know,
you're mad pretty, right?.

1180
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,770
I'm sure you say that
to all of the girls.

1181
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,480
That was real good right there.

1182
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:48,740
Dude, before I forget,

1183
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:50,610
you got that money
for me, right?

1184
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:51,810
Ahh...

1185
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:55,520
No, I don't.

1186
01:14:55,650 --> 01:14:57,620
Come on.
Are you serious?

1187
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:01,690
How about a deposit?

1188
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:04,690
That's five bags, that's $250.
Come on, son.

1189
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,800
Jésus, tonight...

1190
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,710
is your lucky night,

1191
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:18,710
Listen, I don't got cash,

1192
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,610
I didn't feel like going
to the ATM, but...

1193
01:15:21,710 --> 01:15:24,410
Listen to me.
I got something even better.

1194
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:27,450
Are you serious?

1195
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:29,420
Yeah bro...

1196
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:30,620
Of course,
I'm hitting it first.

1197
01:15:30,750 --> 01:15:31,820
No, no, no.

1198
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,620
Sloppy seconds?
I don't like sloppy seconds.

1199
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,030
I'm not doing that.

1200
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:38,860
Better get used to it, man.

1201
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,630
I ain't gonna stick my dick
where another dude just finish
doing that.

1202
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:43,730
I'm gonna hit it first.

1203
01:15:43,740 --> 01:15:45,940
And then I pass it on to you,
and then I bounce,

1204
01:15:46,070 --> 01:15:46,900
and nothing happened.

1205
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:49,040
You know what I'm saying?
That's a good idea.

1206
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:52,780
Dude, that is some good pussy
there man, OK?

1207
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,510
She told me before she'll take
two, three guys at a time,

1208
01:15:56,650 --> 01:15:57,710
Maybe we can share it?

1209
01:15:57,850 --> 01:15:58,810
I never said that.

1210
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:00,380
I ain't riding a train.
That's not my style.

1211
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:01,650
You ride the train
with somebody else.

1212
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:03,150
If I'm gonna hit,
I hit by myself.

1213
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:04,950
You hit by yourself, no train.

1214
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:06,160
You guys are fucking crazy.

1215
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:08,890
Christ!
OK, Jésus...

1216
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:11,530
I got a proposition for you.

1217
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,660
You have till I get back from
taking care of some business

1218
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:14,930
to work your charms.

1219
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:18,430
If you can't work it, then
you're just have to wait your
turn.

1220
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:20,840
Are you willing
to take that wager?

1221
01:16:25,110 --> 01:16:26,010
You know what?

1222
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:28,040
Watch a player play.
I got this.

1223
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:29,380
Great!

1224
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:30,780
Everyone's having a good time.

1225
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:32,010
Beautiful.

1226
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:34,680
Now...

1227
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:36,690
you two...

1228
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:38,620
play nice.

1229
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:50,630
Wait, wait, hold on, baby.

1230
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:53,500
Come on. Where you going?

1231
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:56,170
I saw how you was teasing me.
Chill out, baby.

1232
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:59,980
Jésus, I'm sorry, I was just
being friendly with you.

1233
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:01,980
- But you're not my type.
- Wait, wait...

1234
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:03,010
Not your type?

1235
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:05,080
How do you know I'm not your
type if you haven't even tried
me first?

1236
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:07,780
Is it that whiteboy you after?

1237
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,950
Get off me!
That's enough Jésus, get off me!

1238
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:15,590
Nicholas can't give you what
I'm about to show you.

1239
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:18,490
- This dick is one in a billion.
- Stop it! Stop it!

1240
01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:19,860
Fuck!

1241
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,560
What the fuck you trying to do?

1242
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:24,170
Wait till you feel my type!
100% Dominicano!

1243
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:27,840
You told me
you like this shit dirty.

1244
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:30,410
I know you European girls
like it dirty, now we going raw!

1245
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,940
Get off me! Fuck off!

1246
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:34,180
In life,
you either fuck or get fucked!

1247
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,080
Now, I'm doing the fucking!

1248
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:40,720
Fuck off.

1249
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:41,980
Fuck! Are you crazy?

1250
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,650
Stay away from me.

1251
01:17:43,790 --> 01:17:45,620
Watch where you point that.

1252
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:49,060
You don't fucking know me!

1253
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:52,090
I fucked up niggas
three times your size in jail!

1254
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:54,630
So I suggest
you put that shit down!

1255
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:55,130
Stay away!

1256
01:18:19,690 --> 01:18:20,990
Help me, please!

1257
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:37,540
Hey...

1258
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:38,710
Lovebirds.

1259
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,430
Signe?

1260
01:18:59,630 --> 01:19:00,660
Signe!

1261
01:19:05,670 --> 01:19:07,740
Call 9-1-1. I don't wanna die.

1262
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:09,970
Oh shit.

1263
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:14,580
Shit!

1264
01:19:16,450 --> 01:19:16,910
Fuck!

1265
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:23,410
Sorry.

1266
01:21:51,970 --> 01:21:54,140
Nicholas, it's me.

1267
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:58,410
I did it. It's done.
I got what you want.

1268
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:00,910
Now I want what we agreed on.

1269
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:04,710
Where do we meet?

1270
01:22:30,710 --> 01:22:31,910
Huh-Huh...

1271
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:38,780
Nicholas Feinman...

1272
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:42,150
Hey Nick.

1273
01:22:43,550 --> 01:22:44,820
You like movies?

1274
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:47,660
Cause...

1275
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:49,530
I got a movie today.

1276
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:56,900
Watch it!

1277
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:59,400
Watch the whole fucking thing.

1278
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:03,640
He's begging you for his life.

1279
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,910
That bitch shot him.

1280
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:09,040
And you put him in the ground.

1281
01:23:09,310 --> 01:23:11,050
That's ten grand.

1282
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:13,620
You can have it,
no questions asked.

1283
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:16,690
Don't worry, Nicholas,

1284
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:18,920
I'm taking your money.

1285
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:21,090
But first you and I,

1286
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:22,960
we're gonna party.

1287
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:25,630
You like cocaine?

1288
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:29,800
Open it.

1289
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:33,700
Open it!

1290
01:23:42,380 --> 01:23:43,480
Now take a hit.

1291
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:48,150
I said take a motherfucking hit.

1292
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:55,960
Now take another one.

1293
01:23:58,030 --> 01:23:59,500
I don't want to take
another one.

1294
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:00,700
I ain't asking you.

1295
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:05,700
You like to party
like a rockstar, whiteboy?

1296
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:06,600
Do you?

1297
01:24:06,740 --> 01:24:08,900
We're gonna party all night.

1298
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:12,570
Yeah, you're gonna do that
whole motherfucking brick.

1299
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:22,990
Alright.

1300
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:29,490
Faster!

1301
01:24:33,530 --> 01:24:34,960
Bottoms the fuck up!

1302
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:14,500
Get your stuff together.

1303
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:16,840
Amir's gonna get you
out of here.

1304
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:22,040
So you believe me?

1305
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:23,780
I never said that.

1306
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:27,680
What Jésus said to you
about in life,

1307
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:30,550
you either fuck or get fucked.

1308
01:25:31,650 --> 01:25:32,860
He said that to me too.

1309
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,660
Who wants to live like that?

1310
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,530
I don't.

1311
01:25:42,630 --> 01:25:44,970
But the truth is,
people like us,

1312
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:46,940
people like me,

1313
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:50,740
we're all a little fucked.

1314
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:56,380
So you're going back
to Stockholm.

1315
01:25:56,510 --> 01:25:58,780
The ticket's
under your real name.

1316
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:03,150
August, hey,
I'm sorry I lied about the fire.

1317
01:26:03,490 --> 01:26:04,690
But the rest was true,

1318
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:06,420
he really did
those things to me.

1319
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,520
I can't go back, if I go...

1320
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:09,530
Get your stuff together.

1321
01:26:09,530 --> 01:26:10,860
If I go back,
I go back to jail!

1322
01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:12,760
Put your stuff together now.

1323
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:17,630
Signe, either get on the plane,

1324
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:20,070
or we go see Angel.

1325
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:29,880
No, no, no...

1326
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:34,020
Remember, no eating until
the whole family together.

1327
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:37,990
That brother of yours!

1328
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:41,060
How come he no show up again?

1329
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:44,660
Angel!

1330
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:45,990
Abuela...

1331
01:27:01,950 --> 01:27:03,810
Oh, Dios mío...

1332
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:25,430
So this is it?

1333
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:29,840
Yeah.

1334
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:34,810
How do you know
I'm gonna get on the plane?

1335
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:38,880
Cause you can't cheat
what's coming.

1336
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:45,590
I don't want to be just the kind
of person you think I am.

1337
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:47,020
I said...

1338
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:50,830
more things
that you don't understand.

1339
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:54,560
Like what, Signe?

1340
01:27:55,900 --> 01:27:56,770
Like what?

1341
01:28:22,090 --> 01:28:23,830
Happy Fourth of July.

1342
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:39,040
At the end of it all,
even though I still felt lost,

1343
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:41,840
I realize now that the things
that change you,

1344
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:44,150
are never the ones
you see coming.

1345
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,380
They blind-side you
when you're most vulnerable.

1346
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:50,650
I look back and wonder why

1347
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:53,160
I was never aware of how much
anger I had inside me,

1348
01:28:53,490 --> 01:28:55,860
how much fear and selfishness,

1349
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:59,460
and then I felt like
my heart was gonna explode.

1350
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:07,740
I'm sorry for a lot of things
I said and did,

1351
01:29:07,870 --> 01:29:09,470
things I have to live with now,

1352
01:29:09,610 --> 01:29:11,510
for the rest of my life.

1353
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,440
No way to fix it all.

1354
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:15,540
I did the best I could
at the time.

1355
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:17,150
But I still feel restless.

1356
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:19,950
So I let my mind wander again.

1357
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,960
In those moments, I confronted
myself for the first time.

1358
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:31,490
No more excuses.

1359
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:36,670
No more hang-ups
on chance and faith.

1360
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:41,600
All that was left was
facing the hard truth.

1361
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:45,640
There always will be
possibility.

1362
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:49,510
But it was up to us
to find our way.

1363
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:54,580
We had to do better.

1364
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,790
I had to do better.
