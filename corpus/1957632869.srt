Today, I'm going to be taking

This is Poe.

Okay.

20
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:50,084
Okay.

21
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:57,992
Okay, now,

Well okay.

38
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:13,073
But just remember,

39
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:15,142
we can't be held responsible

40
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:17,044
for what you become.

41
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,913
All you have to
do to get started

42
00:11:18,946 --> 00:11:20,714
is take the challenge

43
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:24,718
and then you begin
reporting your symptoms.

44
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:28,088
If other players like the
direction you're taking the story,

45
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:32,326

expand it further.

00:12:35,155 --> 00:12:37,491
It took me a while to realize

54
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,761
this is Tetris.

55
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,398
I'm playing Tetris.

56
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,002
Now it's all I'm doing.

57
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:53,007
They're up to here now.

58
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:59,013
They're getting closer

59
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:01,315

[beeping]

66
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:05,560
Hey guys.

67
00:17:05,593 --> 00:17:08,730
So, I took the
world's fair challenge

68
00:17:08,763 --> 00:17:12,099
because I love horror movies and

69
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:15,503
I thought it might be cool to
try actually living in one.

70
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:19,406
I used to sleep walk
a lot as a little kid

71
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,209
and I would tell myself these
scary stories in my head

72
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:25,078
so I could fall asleep for once.

73
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,180
And when I'd tell myself
these scary stories,

74
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:28,683
usually when I'd
fall asleep at night,

75
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,552
I'd have these crazy dreams.

76
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:33,320
And I swear in my head it
was like Paranormal Activity.

77
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:35,155
Like I'm not even
lying with you.

78
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,592
Like it was like I was walking

79
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:40,093
around the house possessed
by some evil spirit.

80
00:17:41,596 --> 00:17:43,497
It's funny, I'd be dreaming.

81
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:46,333
I know I'd be dreaming
when it used to happen

82
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,770
but it was like I was also
awake at the same time.

83
00:17:51,773 --> 00:17:53,340
It was like watching
myself on a TV

84
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:54,642
all the way across the room.

85
00:17:54,676 --> 00:17:57,444
And I was aware of my actions.

86
00:17:57,477 --> 00:17:58,713
Yes, granted I was aware,

87
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,347
but I couldn't control myself.

88
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:04,552
I've been kind of
feeling that way recently

89
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:06,320
ever since I watched that video.

90
00:18:06,353 --> 00:18:09,222
That feeling's kind of
creeping up on me a little bit.

91
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,725
I'm not really sure
what to do about it.

92
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,627
I was kind of used to
not having to stress

93
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,428
about every single
time I fell asleep

94
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:15,663
that I'd do something crazy

95
00:18:15,697 --> 00:18:18,833
or like get run over by a car,

96
00:18:18,866 --> 00:18:21,736
just like standing
in front of the car.

97
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:24,539
Cause I tell you if, if-

98
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,642
I might be aware
that a car is coming,

99
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:29,176
but I would just stay there.

100
00:18:32,747 --> 00:18:34,348
My whole body's numb.

101
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,482
I know it should
be cold right now

102
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:36,216
but I don't feel anything.

myself sleeping tonight.

Did you have a bad dream?

118
00:26:30,825 --> 00:26:31,759
Yeah.

119
00:26:32,426 --> 00:26:33,627
Those are hard.

It's okay.

to come out of the,

out of the nightmare.

127
00:26:47,408 --> 00:26:48,809

128
00:26:52,346 --> 00:26:53,714
sometimes it still feels real

I finally heard from her.

607
01:17:15,769 --> 01:17:17,972
She sent me a message on Skype,

608
01:17:19,807 --> 01:17:20,674
apologizing for

609

in an assisted care facility
that winter and spring.

613

comfortable with writing.

615
01:18:00,414 --> 01:18:02,783
We traded messages for a while.

She told me her real name.

617
01:18:05,786 --> 01:18:07,054
I told her mine.

618
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:12,793

And she finally saw my face.

622
01:18:25,005 --> 01:18:27,241

we just didn't know
where to begin.

Afterward,

And it was only
outside the subway

632

the courage to ask her

about that night.

She apologized for the things
she'd said to me that night.

I told her it was all right.

638

I knew she didn't mean them.

639
01:19:21,395 --> 01:19:23,931
And then she didn't say
anything for a long time.

640
01:19:26,568 --> 01:19:28,402
But when she spoke again,

641
01:19:33,374 --> 01:19:35,276
it was like

642
01:19:35,309 --> 01:19:39,813
she knew she was about to say
something that she shouldn't.

I don't know what it was.

651
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:20,854
