Agent Paul Denning.

He was deep undercover with these yieldless for a while.

You know what they'll do.

1120
00:53:11,633 --> 00:53:15,166
Nobody's gonna miss your sorry ass anyhow.

1121
00:53:15,633 --> 00:53:18,533
We retrieved some evidence from the Mercedes and put

1122
00:53:18,566 --> 00:53:21,733
in a few brass clips and other remnants of a

1123
00:53:21,766 --> 00:53:23,166
halibut case.

1124
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,366
Anything in it?

1125
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,166
Money.

1126
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,800
Nowhere near a million dollars.

1127
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:30,033
I'd say maybe $30,000.

1128
00:53:30,066 --> 00:53:31,433
Denning said there was more than that.

1129
00:53:31,466 --> 00:53:32,666
[laughs]

1130
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,300
Not in the trunk.

1131
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,500
I got the lab report here.

1132
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:43,366
Ash, nitrates, and traces of unleaded gas.

1133
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:45,733
That's not much help.

1134
00:53:47,733 --> 00:53:49,700
You said unleaded gas?

1135
00:53:49,733 --> 00:53:51,366
Yeah.

1136
00:53:54,633 --> 00:53:56,966
This is a 300 D.

1137
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,400
Oh god.

1138
00:53:59,433 --> 00:54:01,133
[chuckles]

1139
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:05,333
I suppose no man can judge another man's actions unless

1140
00:54:05,366 --> 00:54:08,200
he's been in the same situation himself.

1141
00:54:08,233 --> 00:54:10,766
Been presented with the same temptations.

1142
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,500
And lord knows, money sure is tempting.

1143
00:54:13,533 --> 00:54:17,266
Hell, some people do just about anything for money.

1144
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:23,633
Lie, cheat, steal, kill.

1145
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,600
Well I think it'd be too hard to kill a man.

1146
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:32,800
Especially if he was half dead, especially if he's

1147
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:35,666
of the criminal persuasion.

1148
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:39,200
How would you know that he was a federal officer with

1149
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:42,733
a wife and a kid?

1150
00:54:47,866 --> 00:54:50,500
You gentlemen look like you're about to lose your lunch.

1151
00:54:50,533 --> 00:54:52,500
[laughs]

1152
00:54:52,533 --> 00:54:55,533
Why don't you get to the point, Jesse?

1153
00:54:55,566 --> 00:54:57,433
Come on, boys, we're friends, right?

1154
00:54:57,466 --> 00:54:59,933
And friends don't squeal on friends.

1155
00:54:59,966 --> 00:55:02,233
That certainly isn't what Jesse Segundo is all about.

1156
00:55:02,266 --> 00:55:04,566
Then what the hell are you all about, Jesse?

1157
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,133
I covered for you Earl.

1158
00:55:06,166 --> 00:55:07,200
For both of you.

1159
00:55:07,233 --> 00:55:09,166
I put my ass on the line to save yours so don't you

1160
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,166
pull a hostile tone with me.

1161
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,566
What are you proposing, Jess?

1162
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,066
I just want my fair share.

1163
00:55:21,533 --> 00:55:23,366
Fourteen-five.

1164
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,100
Fifteen.

1165
00:55:25,133 --> 00:55:27,266
One million, five hundred thousand.

1166
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,600
Sweet mother, we're millionaires.

1167
00:55:32,366 --> 00:55:33,866
I'll settle for the third of that.

1168
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,433
And if we refuse?

1169
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:39,800
Tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor.

1170
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:41,700
Well now that's true, Earl.

1171
00:55:41,733 --> 00:55:44,566
But neither is murdering a federal agent and stealing

1172
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:45,733
a million five.

1173
00:55:45,766 --> 00:55:48,966
In fact, I'd say that's considerably worse,

1174
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,466
wouldn't you, Earl?

1175
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:54,133
Alright, alright.

1176
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:56,700
We'll play it your way, Jess.

1177
00:55:56,733 --> 00:55:59,233
Under one condition.

1178
00:55:59,266 --> 00:56:00,700
I'm all ears.

1179
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:05,100
We're gonna wait until this whole thing dies down.

1180
00:56:05,133 --> 00:56:06,600
No, I don't think that's such a good idea.

1181
00:56:06,633 --> 00:56:08,100
That's the way we're gonna play it.

1182
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:11,333
Now if you don't like that then forget it.

1183
00:56:15,366 --> 00:56:17,133
Hey, I'm easy.

1184
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:18,766
Okay, I'll wait.

1185
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,333
But I'm gonna need an advance to oil the wheels

1186
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:24,100
so to speak.

1187
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:28,166
Well how much?

1188
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:30,466
I don't think $2000's gonna raise any eyebrows, do you?

1189
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:32,033
$2000?

1190
00:56:32,066 --> 00:56:34,200
By Friday.

1191
00:56:39,266 --> 00:56:40,666
The fuck do you think you're going?

1192
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:44,200
I'm not going anywhere, Frank, until you give me the tape.

1193
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:45,666
Whoa, George.

1194
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,833
If it's not Derek stabbing me in the back, then it's

1195
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:49,366
you confessing on your knees.

1196
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,500
So Frank, trust me.

1197
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,166
You're gonna turn state seven up against us, aren't you?

1198
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,266
My god!

1199
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,933
State seven's, holy shit!

1200
00:56:56,966 --> 00:56:57,866
Hey, hun.

1201
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:01,700
Where's that uh, hot pad?

1202
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,566
What?

1203
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:09,800
That uh, that therapeutic back thing.

1204
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:11,700
I can't hear a word you're saying.

1205
00:57:11,733 --> 00:57:14,200
Give me the gun.

1206
00:57:14,233 --> 00:57:15,000
Come on.

1207
00:57:15,033 --> 00:57:16,133
Time is getting back!

1208
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,833
George. Don't do this. Please, George.

1209
00:57:17,866 --> 00:57:18,666
Michael, I mean it.

1210
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:20,433
George. George!

1211
00:57:20,466 --> 00:57:22,333
[gunshot]

1212
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,333
[groans]

1213
00:57:45,066 --> 00:57:46,833
What the hell is this?

1214
00:57:46,866 --> 00:57:49,166
What are you digging around in my closet for?

1215
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,000
I was looking for the heating pad.

1216
00:57:52,033 --> 00:57:56,133
You mind telling me where in the hell this came from?

1217
00:57:56,166 --> 00:57:59,400
Is there something going on here that I don't know about?

1218
00:58:01,366 --> 00:58:03,133
What do you mean?

1219
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:06,000
I mean are you spending my money on things I don't know about?

1220
00:58:06,033 --> 00:58:08,666
Like you got any furs in there or something?

1221
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,400
Don't be ridiculous.

1222
00:58:10,433 --> 00:58:13,733
It wasn't so expensive.

1223
00:58:13,766 --> 00:58:15,700
It was supposed to be a surprise.

1224
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:17,166
Yeah, well I don't like surprises.

1225
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,666
Not when I'm the one footing the bill.

1226
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:23,066
You're about as romantic as a bag of sand.

1227
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:33,300
I could've killed that son of a bitch.

1228
00:58:33,333 --> 00:58:34,900
Alright, enough.

1229
00:58:34,933 --> 00:58:36,066
I'm tired of thinking about it.

1230
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:37,633
Well I'm not.

1231
00:58:37,666 --> 00:58:39,900
He thinks he's got us by the balls.

1232
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,000
Well, he does.

1233
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:44,433
Besides, if that DEA lady had heard that tape, we'd

1234
00:58:44,466 --> 00:58:45,600
be in jail right now.

1235
00:58:45,633 --> 00:58:47,200
Let's just call it the cost of doing business and

1236
00:58:47,233 --> 00:58:48,900
be done with it.

1237
00:58:48,933 --> 00:58:51,833
This whole thing is screwed up anyway.

1238
00:58:51,866 --> 00:58:52,800
I know what we gotta do.

1239
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,966
We gotta get that tape.

1240
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,200
How do you figure we do that?

1241
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:57,100
He's probably made copies.

1242
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:59,633
Well we'll get those, too.

1243
00:58:59,666 --> 00:59:01,833
Booth, he's gonna be trouble.

1244
00:59:01,866 --> 00:59:03,366
We gotta straighten Jesse out.

1245
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:05,866
Like it or not, he's a partner now.

1246
00:59:08,833 --> 00:59:10,166
Have you been back here?

1247
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,300
-No. -Earl.

1248
00:59:15,433 --> 00:59:17,400
I just took a little out.

1249
00:59:17,433 --> 00:59:19,666
I'm keeping track of it, you can trust me!

1250
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,966
Damnit, was I talking to a wall?

1251
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,400
We had a deal.

1252
00:59:24,433 --> 00:59:26,433
For crying out loud, Booth, I just needed to

1253
00:59:26,466 --> 00:59:29,233
pay off a few debts is all.

1254
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:31,033
Now you got my word on it.

1255
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:33,533
I'm not coming back here until the whole thing

1256
00:59:33,566 --> 00:59:35,966
cools down, I promise.

1257
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,400
That's what you said last time.

1258
00:59:38,433 --> 00:59:40,066
Yeah, but...

1259
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,733
this time I mean it.

1260
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,833
[indistinct chatter]

1261
01:00:13,466 --> 01:00:15,000
He found the lingerie.

1262
01:00:15,033 --> 01:00:15,900
What?

1263
01:00:15,933 --> 01:00:18,700
I told him about as a surprise.

1264
01:00:18,733 --> 01:00:20,233
I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know

1265
01:00:20,266 --> 01:00:21,700
if he mentions it.

1266
01:00:21,733 --> 01:00:22,733
How the hell did he find it?

1267
01:00:22,766 --> 01:00:24,100
He started thinking digging through my closet,

1268
01:00:24,133 --> 01:00:25,066
something he never does.

1269
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,600
[sighs] Great.

1270
01:00:27,633 --> 01:00:28,633
It's okay, Booth.

1271
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,000
It's no big deal.

1272
01:00:30,033 --> 01:00:31,000
Let's hope so.

1273
01:00:31,033 --> 01:00:32,833
If he asks me again, I'm just gonna tell him I

1274
01:00:32,866 --> 01:00:34,666
returned it all.

1275
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,900
Damn, I hate this so much.

1276
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:38,666
I know.

1277
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,000
I can't stand him sleeping next to you slobbering all over you.

1278
01:00:42,033 --> 01:00:46,133
He doesn't slobber, he just snores.

1279
01:00:46,166 --> 01:00:49,066
I told you, we haven't done anything in over a year.

1280
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:50,133
It doesn't matter.

1281
01:00:50,166 --> 01:00:51,733
He's next to you.

1282
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:55,833
I'm getting out of here, Sally.

1283
01:00:55,866 --> 01:00:57,300
Hey.

1284
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:58,866
Something for you.

1285
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,066
Dwayne just needs that signature.

1286
01:01:03,733 --> 01:01:04,700
Sally.

1287
01:01:04,733 --> 01:01:06,233
Anthony.

1288
01:01:06,966 --> 01:01:08,033
There you go.

1289
01:01:09,733 --> 01:01:11,233
That's a nice dress.

1290
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,333
We're leaving.

1291
01:01:19,366 --> 01:01:20,400
This weekend.

1292
01:01:20,433 --> 01:01:21,400
Things aren't set.

1293
01:01:21,433 --> 01:01:23,100
Yeah, they are.

1294
01:01:23,133 --> 01:01:24,266
How?

1295
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:26,900
Well I can't tell you all the details, but you're

1296
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:30,466
