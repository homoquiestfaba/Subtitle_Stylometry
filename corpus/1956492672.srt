see the war end,

385
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:30,578
maybe even see
your mom and I settle down.

386
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,749
You know
what his name is, son?

387
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:37,919
Henry.

Ah, little Genzo.

Look at you.

00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:32,366
Where were you?

00:43:32,368 --> 00:43:33,701
Manzanar.

Colinas de Oro,

Everybody there Japanese.

We went to Indiana.

No one there is Japanese,

409
00:43:50,404 --> 00:43:52,362
but that's where
a farm took us in.

Hey, Mama.

00:44:01,656 --> 00:44:03,731
Save some for the
others, Yamato-san.

412
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:05,308
I can barely
keep up.

You make these?

No appetite?

00:44:21,251 --> 00:44:23,769
Bad memories.

00:44:23,771 --> 00:44:25,103
I hate that

421
00:44:25,105 --> 00:44:26,846
I come back to

422
00:44:26,848 --> 00:44:28,523

nightmares.

423
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:33,928
But your babies
