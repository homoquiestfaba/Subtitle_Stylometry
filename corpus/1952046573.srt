1
00:00:01,682 --> 00:00:04,173
- (eerie music playing)
- (whimpering)

2
00:00:21,368 --> 00:00:24,428
(screams)

3
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:30,902
Following the sign
to Camp Crystal Lake

4
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:33,606
can only mean one thing...
bad luck.

5
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:35,706
For her, not for us.

6
00:00:35,749 --> 00:00:39,549
You see in 1980 when
producer/director Sean Cunningham

7
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:43,215
released a little film
into the world called "Friday the 13th,"

8
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:45,281
not even he could have
imagined the success

9
00:00:45,325 --> 00:00:48,692
or the fame or the carnage
that would ensue.

10
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:50,560
With 12 movies to date,

11
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:52,189
an endless body count

12
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:55,292
and over a half billion
in worldwide box-office dollars,

13
00:00:55,335 --> 00:00:57,428
"Friday the 13th" gave birth

14
00:00:57,471 --> 00:01:00,372
to one of the greatest
cinematic villains of our time.

15
00:01:00,407 --> 00:01:02,007
She doesn't know what she's in for.

16
00:01:02,242 --> 00:01:04,506
So lock up your cabin doors,
zip up your tents

17
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:07,138
and make sure that
your car does indeed start,

18
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,082
because tonight
he could be anywhere.

19
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:13,552
So you wondering
who I'm talking about?

20
00:01:13,587 --> 00:01:16,055
His name was Jason.

21
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:19,081
(blood splattering)

22
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:23,221
(screaming)

23
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:28,093
For some of us,

24
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:31,825
the problems we have as adults
go back to our mothers.

25
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:33,799
In the case of Jason,

26
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,859
truer words
were never spoken.

27
00:02:35,902 --> 00:02:37,870
(man softly)
Kill kill kill...

28
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:40,896
In the late '70s,
Steve Miner and I had made a couple

29
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:42,465
of children's movies

30
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,841
and neither one of them
was very successful.

31
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,711
And we had to do something
to keep the lights on.

32
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:51,376
And so we came up with this notion
of doing "Friday the 13th."

33
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:54,114
We had a title and a need

34
00:02:54,154 --> 00:02:56,554
- to make some money.
- (shatters)

35
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,048
The thing about the story
is that it's so profoundly simple.

36
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:04,029
The longest part of the process
of creating the first "Friday the 13th"

37
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,998
was figuring out the venue,

38
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:10,025
so I had to find some territory
that was adult-free

39
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,935
so that these kids would be
on their own

40
00:03:11,972 --> 00:03:13,496
and we could pick them off
one by one.

41
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,531
My character was sort of like

42
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:17,566
the Janet Leigh in "Psycho."

43
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:19,579
I'm the setup character
to follow,

44
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:21,774
but I didn't last too long.

45
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:24,409
We ran into the woods
where it was safe.

46
00:03:24,451 --> 00:03:26,419
Cunningham:
We had this notion that these kids

47
00:03:26,453 --> 00:03:28,751
would be out at a summer camp
and would be threatened

48
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:30,619
by some kind of serial killer.

49
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:33,285
We would then be surprised
to discover

50
00:03:33,326 --> 00:03:35,089
who the serial killer was at the end.

51
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:38,393
Mrs. Voorhees,
who is mighty pissed off

52
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:40,456
that her son Jason

53
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,559
drowned while
a couple of counselors

54
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:44,866
were off boning somewhere.

55
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:47,567
The counselors weren't
paying any attention.

56
00:03:47,607 --> 00:03:50,974
They were making love
while that young boy drowned.

57
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:54,208
The scariest moment
in the original movie

58
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:58,047
is when Alice realizes

59
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:00,985
that Pamela is the killer.

60
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:03,148
Kill her, Mommy!

61
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,384
Kill her!

62
00:04:05,425 --> 00:04:08,883
And that's the beginning
of the chase at the end of the movie.

63
00:04:08,929 --> 00:04:12,057
(screaming)

64
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:14,259
And when we think all is quiet

65
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:17,429
and she survived
that horrible Friday the 13th...

66
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,236
The boy, is he dead too?

67
00:04:21,274 --> 00:04:22,741
Policeman: Who?

68
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:26,109
The one who attacked me, the one
who pulled me underneath the water!

69
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:29,638
Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.

70
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:31,412
Then he's still there.

71
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:34,249
And he certainly was.

72
00:04:34,287 --> 00:04:36,517
Lauren-Marie Taylor:
Before we started filming "Part 2,"

73
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:39,320
they had us watch
the original "Friday the 13th,"

74
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,589
which almost scared me off
to not doing the project,

75
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:43,323
'cause it really freaked
me out.

76
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:45,331
After the first one

77
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:46,992
Jason had been created,

78
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:49,763
so the notion of having a surprise

79
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:53,204
as to who it is or what it is
changed completely.

80
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:55,207
So what the stories became

81
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:58,335
was sort of a ritualized telling

82
00:04:58,378 --> 00:05:01,347
of a group of young people
who go someplace

83
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:03,975
- where they shouldn't go.
- (gasps)

84
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:06,713
What are you kids
doing out here?

85
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:10,880
We come back to Crystal Lake
to open up this camp again.

86
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:13,688
The ghost of the past,

87
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:15,285
Jason comes to haunt them.

88
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:16,795
Todd:
And one by one,

89
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,663
Jason Voorhees kills us

90
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:22,133
and continues to do
what he does best.

91
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:24,830
"Part 2" was basically
his journey

92
00:05:24,871 --> 00:05:27,999
of seeking revenge
over the death of his mother.

93
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,737
And he's got her
decapitated head

94
00:05:30,777 --> 00:05:32,506
on his mantelpiece.

95
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:34,979
He just keeps killing and killing.

96
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:42,349
And that's the journey
that's taken us for 30 years.

97
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:44,152
It's remarkable.

98
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:47,023
Cunningham: I really thought
it wasn't gonna work the way it did,

99
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,654
and I'm delighted
to have been so wrong.

100
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:53,063
"Friday the 13th Part III"...
we get the gimmick movie.

101
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:56,330
"Friday the 13th III" in 3D,
and that is also the movie

102
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:59,270
where Jason will choose
his infamous mask.

103
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:01,637
The day after the events
in "Part 2"...

104
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:03,666
so it's technically
Saturday the 14th,

105
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,373
but don't tell anyone...
a group of teenagers

106
00:06:07,414 --> 00:06:10,611
all go up to the cabin
to visit Chris Higgins,

107
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,117
little knowing that Jason

108
00:06:12,152 --> 00:06:14,746
is still out there killing everyone.

109
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:16,881
Ugh!

110
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:18,891
Through all the 3D movies
I've ever done,

111
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:20,893
nobody talks about any of them.

112
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,794
All they ever wanna
talk about is when can we see

113
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,855
"Friday the 13th" in 3D.

114
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:29,597
Ryan Rotten: Four is where things
start getting interesting.

115
00:06:29,636 --> 00:06:33,436
It starts to introduce
a protagonist Tommy Jarvis,

116
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:36,931
who we'll start seeing
in other sequels.

117
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:40,571
I was told that this was
gonna be the last of the series.

118
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:43,776
And this again would be
about death at the end,

119
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,284
because Jason was going to die.

120
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:47,286
Barney Cohen: Jason had been hit
in the head with an axe.

121
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,017
He had been carted off in an ambulance.
We pick him up almost in real time

122
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:53,491
arriving dead at a hospital.

123
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:55,926
And then Jason breaks out
of the morgue.

124
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:59,454
Leave me alone!
(screaming)

125
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:02,832
And then the kids
in the car arrive at the lake

126
00:07:02,869 --> 00:07:05,633
and bump into us.
There's skinny-dipping

127
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:08,197
- and all kinds of things.
- Partying... we're partying on down

128
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:10,300
and then we all got killed.

129
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:11,935
In very quick succession.

130
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:15,141
My character Rob
had a sister named Sandra,

131
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,649
who was a counselor
at Crystal Lake in "Part 2."

132
00:07:17,684 --> 00:07:21,814
This dude looks like
he's been hunting Jason for years.

133
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,655
The one time I saw the movie...
going to the opening night screening

134
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:27,091
on Hollywood Boulevard...

135
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:29,755
during the whole entire movie
just people screaming,

136
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:32,924
it was like this cathartic
experience for everybody.

137
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:34,160
It's a thrill ride.

138
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,499
I remember that we're supposed
to think Corey Feldman's

139
00:07:37,537 --> 00:07:40,335
gonna pick up the torch
and be the next Jason.

140
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:46,673
"Part 5" was truly
a departure

141
00:07:46,713 --> 00:07:49,238
because they went
in a totally different direction.

142
00:07:49,282 --> 00:07:53,116
They decide they're gonna set it
in a halfway house

143
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:55,121
for weird fucked-up kids.

144
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:57,885
And there's this dude
and he's killing the kids off

145
00:07:57,924 --> 00:07:59,824
and he's using Jason's mask.

146
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:03,818
We don't see Jason in that movie,
except for hallucinations,

147
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:07,128
flashbacks... that's it.

148
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,227
When the film opened
it was opening, I think,

149
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,067
in 2,000 theaters
across the country.

150
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:13,970
In 1984, that was a lot.

151
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:16,475
Frank Mancuso called me
late that night...

152
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:18,477
2:00, 3:00 in the morning,

153
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:21,071
so excited,
saying these numbers

154
00:08:21,114 --> 00:08:23,947
are like the golden times.
This is unheard of.

155
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:26,383
Shavar Ross:
When the supposed Jason fell,

156
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,150
I love the part where
he just goes right through those spikes.

157
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:34,018
Because you can just see the dummy

158
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,722
just going right on the spike.

159
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:38,060
Another piece of advice,

160
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:40,793
don't allow the overweight
mentally-handicapped son

161
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,860
of the local ambulance driver
to get hacked to shit over a candy bar.

162
00:08:43,903 --> 00:08:46,167
Because chances are
that driver's gonna turn

163
00:08:46,206 --> 00:08:48,231
into a Jason clone
and try to take people out.

164
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:50,799
Adam Green: They brought him back
again in "VI," and he killed Horshack

165
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:52,709
at the beginning,
which was awesome.

166
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:54,508
And he was kind of like
Frankenstein because a lightning bolt

167
00:08:54,547 --> 00:08:56,674
that came out of nowhere
brought him back to life,

168
00:08:56,716 --> 00:08:58,809
and there was maggots on his face,
which was really cool.

169
00:08:58,852 --> 00:09:01,320
I think it was extremely violent.

170
00:09:01,354 --> 00:09:02,548
I mean, you look at it and you go,

171
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:05,353
"Wow, there's tongue-in-cheek
in this. There's rock music in this."

172
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:08,588
But Jason, in fact,
in this movie, bends people in half,

173
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:11,597
twists their heads off,
does a triple beheading.

174
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:15,192
I really didn't want it to be
just about you have sex and die,

175
00:09:15,235 --> 00:09:18,363
'cause that had been done. It's sort
of like you're in the wrong place

176
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:20,463
at the wrong time kind of thing,

177
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:23,805
and also try to have the characters
have a sense of humor.

178
00:09:23,843 --> 00:09:27,210
When Nancy's killed
and the American Express card floats

179
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:29,807
out of her hand, inevitably
there was always some clown

180
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:31,407
that would go,
"Don't leave home without it!"

181
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:33,942
Kevin Spirtas:
In "Part VII," the girl whose got these

182
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:36,888
extraordinary telekinetic powers

183
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:40,086
resurrects him by throwing
her anger and her energy

184
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:42,094
into the lake
where he's already been killed

185
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:43,720
from a previous movie.

186
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:47,324
She musters all of her
telekinetic ability to raise him

187
00:09:47,367 --> 00:09:49,597
and thus begins the story.

188
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:56,905
That's what really made it different.
She had the psychic abilities

189
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:59,468
which he had not fought before,
but realistically,

190
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:02,413
the psychic stuff would have had
to have been in there anyway,

191
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:04,712
because this monster
kept coming back.

192
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:06,776
He's a surreal monster.

193
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:09,811
Jason, played by Kane Hodder,
I believe, for the first time.

194
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:14,417
"VII" starts the Kane Hodder era.

195
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,985
Everything about the way
Kane Hodder played him

196
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,363
makes him menacing
and yet he's human.

197
00:10:22,502 --> 00:10:25,630
Elizabeth Kaitan: I remember thinking,
"Wow, this is Jason!"

198
00:10:25,672 --> 00:10:28,334
I grew up watching this,
and here he is chasing me.

199
00:10:28,374 --> 00:10:30,137
(chokes)

200
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:33,543
Since I was doing it for the first
time, there seems to be some anger there,

201
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:36,639
some differences that you
didn't see in Jason before.

202
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:39,811
The kids love
Kane Hodder's Jason.

203
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:42,821
Rob Galluzzo: The coolest
teaser trailer to a movie ever

204
00:10:42,855 --> 00:10:45,790
was " Friday the 13th 8:
Jason Takes Manhattan."

205
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:47,554
You get this trailer
where you don't know what is it

206
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,652
and then they reveal that
it's Jason in the middle of the city.

207
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:51,391
I live in New York.
I was stoked. I was like,

208
00:10:51,431 --> 00:10:53,626
"Oh my God. He's coming to New York.
He's coming to where I know."

209
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,531
When they first brought me in
to do the movie,

210
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:59,129
the first question I asked them was
does it have to be in Crystal Lake?

211
00:10:59,172 --> 00:11:02,164
Can I take Jason out
of Crystal Lake?

212
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:04,768
The general plot
of "Friday the 13th Part 8"

213
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:07,837
is a young woman
and her graduating class

214
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,044
of Crystal Lake High going
on a big cruise to New York.

215
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:15,646
One by one,
the classmates are killed off.

216
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:18,521
The single most amazing thing
that I've ever done

217
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:21,994
as the character was shooting
the scenes in Times Square

218
00:11:22,028 --> 00:11:23,757
in "Jason Takes Manhattan."

219
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:26,264
I felt like a rock star.

220
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:28,358
(raspy breathing)

221
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:33,672
"Part 9"...they went
from not having blood

222
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:35,333
to not having Jason.

223
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:39,004
There was something about Jason
transferring from body to body to body.

224
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:42,242
Joe Lynch:
Then Jason comes back to life

225
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:44,306
and to Crystal Lake
and is exploded

226
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,615
and becomes a bunch
of demon-hearted baby things

227
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:50,053
and decides to possess
a couple of people.

228
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:53,354
And then gets thwarted again by " 21
Jump Street" himself Steven Williams.

229
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:54,860
Adam Green:
He really wasn't in the movie.

230
00:11:54,894 --> 00:11:57,454
It was kind of other people. Then if
he was in a mirror, you could see him.

231
00:11:57,497 --> 00:11:58,964
And he could transport
into bodies.

232
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:01,523
But the best part was when
he was this little worm thing

233
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:04,832
and he went...
was it the girl from "Buck Rogers"?

234
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:07,738
Is that who she was? He went
in her pussy and that was awesome.

235
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:11,107
They basically tried
to create a mythology for Jason.

236
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:14,841
There are a lot of Jason fans
who to this day

237
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:17,748
are pissed off at me

238
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:19,775
for blowing up Jason.

239
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,456
James Isaac: "Jason X" takes place
400 years in the future.

240
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,789
And a group
of science students,

241
00:12:27,827 --> 00:12:29,658
kids go on a field trip.

242
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:31,788
These students go on.
They're on the planet.

243
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:35,790
They're digging things up,
and of course they find Jason.

244
00:12:35,835 --> 00:12:38,565
Anyway, Jason wakes up
and of course does what Jason does.

245
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:41,129
We set it up
that Kay-Em actually did kill him.

246
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:42,664
This time he got killed, right?

247
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,233
Then the nanobots
bring him together

248
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:47,007
and now he's part machine,

249
00:12:47,046 --> 00:12:50,311
and so he's more unstoppable
than ever.

250
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:53,944
To this day, still,
when people mention that movie,

251
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:56,420
they're like,
"I love that fake boob scene!"

252
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,955
All right, the story
of "Freddy vs. Jason" is a hybrid story.

253
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:08,160
You're bringing these two
great characters together finally.

254
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:10,465
Tony Timpone:
It took them literally decades

255
00:13:10,503 --> 00:13:13,199
before they came up with a story
that was strong enough

256
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,968
to support these two characters.

257
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:18,943
The premise of this movie
was for Freddy to use Jason

258
00:13:18,978 --> 00:13:20,673
to get his powers back.

259
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:23,375
There came a point where
you had to choose a side.

260
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:26,613
And I was a Jason guy, always.

261
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:30,486
So for "Jason vs. Freddy,"
I didn't wanna see anything

262
00:13:30,523 --> 00:13:33,253
but Jason kick Freddy's ass.

263
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:36,557
Lynch: If it wasn't for Alice killing
Mrs. Voorhees in that one film,

264
00:13:36,596 --> 00:13:38,063
none of this would happen.

265
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:41,123
I like Jason Voorhees.
He has a backstory,

266
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,499
and he has a reason
for being the way he is.

267
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:46,369
What a messed up kid.

268
00:13:46,405 --> 00:13:49,169
I think that just
in the overall energy

269
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,733
of trying to do it simple
and scary

270
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:54,575
was the thing that drove
the whole process forward.

271
00:13:56,716 --> 00:14:00,277
After all that,
who could imagine that Jason,

272
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:04,278
the bloodthirsty
indestructible force of nature,

273
00:14:04,323 --> 00:14:06,883
was at one time
an innocent kid

274
00:14:06,926 --> 00:14:08,655
just like the rest of us?

275
00:14:08,694 --> 00:14:11,128
Well, most of us.

276
00:14:11,164 --> 00:14:14,065
Jason not only witnessed
his mother's beheading.

277
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,967
But he was shot and stabbed

278
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:19,062
and burned and sent to hell

279
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:21,596
and shot into outer space.

280
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:24,166
I think to really
understand Jason

281
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,007
you gotta go back
to the beginning...

282
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:28,775
who he is,
where he came from,

283
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:31,282
why he can't resist
a good kill.

284
00:14:36,055 --> 00:14:38,717
(man softly)
Kill kill kill...

285
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:41,454
Does Jason have a soul?
I don't think so.

286
00:14:41,494 --> 00:14:45,021
He is not mindless.
I think actually that's something

287
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:46,725
that the fans would like
to learn more about...

288
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:48,427
what's going on in his head.

289
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:50,458
Jason started
as a drowning victim.

290
00:14:50,503 --> 00:14:51,868
That's as simple
as you can make it.

291
00:14:51,904 --> 00:14:54,873
He's just a little boy
who was ignored

292
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:57,933
by his camp counselors
and couldn't swim very well

293
00:14:57,977 --> 00:15:00,969
and drowned. And no matter
what movie you're talking about,

294
00:15:01,013 --> 00:15:02,981
he's still a victim.

295
00:15:03,015 --> 00:15:05,916
For any good villain,
there's always that sadness to them,

296
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:08,512
and that thing where you can
almost feel bad for them.

297
00:15:08,554 --> 00:15:11,990
He didn't do anything wrong.
He didn't deserve to die.

298
00:15:12,024 --> 00:15:15,619
Jason was the outcast. Jason was
the little kid who got picked on.

299
00:15:15,661 --> 00:15:18,630
And now Jason's the one
who's getting the last laugh in a way,

300
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:20,222
or the last slash.

301
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:21,824
Who did it start with?
His mother.

302
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:25,428
I'm Mrs. Voorhees,
an old friend of the Christies.

303
00:15:25,471 --> 00:15:28,235
The fact that she's a loon,
totally out of her mind

304
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:30,834
and also channeling her son
and going...

305
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:33,902
Kill her, Mommy.
Kill her!

306
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:36,073
The idea for the character
came out

307
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:38,083
of my own past.

308
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:41,086
Mrs. Voorhees
is the mother I never had.

309
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,112
She is the mother
who will kill people

310
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:46,852
to avenge her son's death.
But, hey,

311
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:48,883
if you're gonna have
a mother defend you,

312
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:50,691
she might as well be crazy.

313
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,790
Palmer:
They love Mrs. Voorhees.

314
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:57,792
And I've said to people,
I say, " Why do you love her

315
00:15:57,837 --> 00:15:59,930
as much as you do
when she's supposed

316
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:02,532
to be this dreadful human being?"

317
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:06,511
And they say because
we understand why you did it.

318
00:16:06,545 --> 00:16:10,003
Mrs. Voorhees was
really not a murderess.

319
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:13,348
All she was trying to do was
to protect other children

320
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:15,286
from being drowned.

321
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:19,381
One of the things that
really works for "Part 2"

322
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:22,917
is that you do have this kind
of passing of the baton

323
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:25,988
going from Mrs. Voorhees
to Jason.

324
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:28,830
Basically, he is fueled
by vengeance

325
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:30,392
for the death of his mother.

326
00:16:30,436 --> 00:16:33,633
See, it's this seeking
righteous vengeance

327
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:36,301
that defines
the Jason character

328
00:16:36,342 --> 00:16:39,004
and also separates
Jason Voorhees

329
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:42,572
from all the other horror icons.

330
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:44,480
(screams)

331
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:46,382
King:
Jason's misunderstood.

332
00:16:46,419 --> 00:16:48,046
What happens is

333
00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:51,853
when he watches
Alice kill his mother,

334
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:55,657
I believe Alice unleashes
the monster in Jason.

335
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:57,390
You feel bad for anybody
who has to see

336
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,762
their mom get their head cut off
on a beach. I know I do.

337
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:02,131
Barton:
So he finds this potato sack,

338
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:04,466
throws it over his head,
cuts out his little eyehole

339
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:07,563
and does his thing. He starts
plying his craft for the first time

340
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:10,097
that he learned
from his mom.

341
00:17:10,142 --> 00:17:11,404
(screams)

342
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:13,378
I think he observed the camp
after many years,

343
00:17:13,412 --> 00:17:15,676
kids coming and going.

344
00:17:15,715 --> 00:17:19,151
I think at one point that's
when he decided to do what he did.

345
00:17:19,185 --> 00:17:22,245
I think what he's doing
is protecting his home.

346
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:25,849
And anybody that walks
into his territory is kind of doomed.

347
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:31,552
Honestly, I don't think he's angry.
I think he's sad.

348
00:17:31,597 --> 00:17:33,622
Poor Jason was brought
into this world

349
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,396
and he really had a tough start.

350
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,767
Kaitan:
If your mother killed a bunch of people,

351
00:17:38,804 --> 00:17:41,068
you would be a very tragic child,
I would say.

352
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:44,201
It's like kind of a Ted Bundy
upbringing.

353
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:47,212
Here was this tortured soul

354
00:17:47,246 --> 00:17:48,838
who lived for years

355
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:51,816
just on probably the revenge.

356
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:53,910
I think Ginny kind of understood

357
00:17:53,953 --> 00:17:57,650
there's more to it than just
this demon guy.

358
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,749
Jason, Mother is talking to you.

359
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:05,086
By putting on his mother's sweater
and trying to speak like her,

360
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:07,224
it almost confused him
for a second.

361
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:09,928
King: You see him questioning,
is that my mother?

362
00:18:09,969 --> 00:18:13,063
He wanted to believe
his mother was still alive.

363
00:18:13,105 --> 00:18:14,902
I guess Jason was
a unique character.

364
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,908
He wasn't just somebody

365
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:20,343
who put on a facemask.

366
00:18:20,379 --> 00:18:22,176
He was a whole creature.

367
00:18:22,214 --> 00:18:25,081
Lynch: It's almost like Jason
is a personification

368
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:27,745
of the dark side of all of us.

369
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:30,153
I find in this character
elements of myself.

370
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:32,350
And there are monstrous elements
of myself

371
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:35,258
that are bent on self-destruction
and destroying others.

372
00:18:35,294 --> 00:18:37,125
And there are parts of myself
that feel wronged

373
00:18:37,163 --> 00:18:39,791
and I'm unjustly treated
and I'm the victim.

374
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:43,324
He just hated everything
about people.

375
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:46,702
His reason for killing
is just because he does.

376
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:49,071
Don't reason with him.
He doesn't reason with you.

377
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:51,975
It's all in his own head.

378
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:53,501
He just does it.

379
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:55,446
He's definitely
a tortured tragic soul,

380
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:57,881
but the truth is you can't go
around life with this badge

381
00:18:57,917 --> 00:19:00,442
that you've been tortured
and kill and slash.

382
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:04,047
At some point,
it's gotta stop.

383
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:06,023
The main aspect

384
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:08,856
that enhances
the otherworldly character

385
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:12,057
of Jason is that
he's silent and faceless...

386
00:19:12,097 --> 00:19:14,497
like death... the death mask.

387
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:16,831
It's plenty scary,
the mystery of the unknown.

388
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:19,394
What is behind that
potato sack?

389
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:21,406
In "Friday the 13th Part III,"

390
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,240
Jason wears, for the very first time,
a hockey mask,

391
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:28,735
which he has taken from Shelly

392
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:32,012
when Shelly made the bad mistake
of walking into the barn

393
00:19:32,051 --> 00:19:33,518
carrying the hockey mask.

394
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,713
And the moment when he puts
on the hockey mask

395
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:38,814
and realizes it,
it's a great moment for the franchise,

396
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:42,453
'cause it's like,
"What was I thinking?

397
00:19:42,495 --> 00:19:45,089
I should have been wearing
this all along. This is awesome."

398
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,529
This dock behind me,

399
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:50,399
this is where the legend
of Jason was born.

400
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:53,405
This is the first time
we saw him step out

401
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:55,566
in the hockey mask.

402
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:57,075
The birth of Jason.

403
00:19:57,109 --> 00:20:00,442
There's something
to be said about

404
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:02,777
putting a mask on

405
00:20:02,815 --> 00:20:06,774
and doing things
that you wouldn't normally do

406
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:09,185
with that mask off.

407
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:11,416
Katz:
Jason in "Part III" runs.

408
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:14,290
That's the one where he runs.
Jason's a bit of a manic hillbilly

409
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:17,295
in "III" still.
Got a little of that left over.

410
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:19,729
After that he becomes
the slow methodical stalker.

411
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:22,632
Todd Farmer: If he sees you,
he's not gonna stop.

412
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:26,297
It's like a beacon.
Once he's popped in on you,

413
00:20:26,338 --> 00:20:28,306
he's gonna stay there
until he kills you.

414
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,035
And it doesn't matter
what he has to use.

415
00:20:30,075 --> 00:20:33,602
He's terribly creative.
And he's got lots of weapons.

416
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:36,046
He really had a thing
for knives,

417
00:20:36,081 --> 00:20:38,447
and he really had a thing
for machetes.

418
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,975
He likes to puncture
through the body...

419
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,385
He really likes spears.

420
00:20:42,421 --> 00:20:45,151
...sawing off heads,
twisting heads, crushing heads...

421
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,715
Taylor:
He was really into anything

422
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,627
that would splash blood.

423
00:20:51,931 --> 00:20:54,297
...punching heads off,
eyes popping out.

424
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,630
I mean, he's a showman.

425
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:58,000
It was really about
watching Jason do his thing.

426
00:20:58,037 --> 00:21:00,597
He was the protagonist
in these films.

427
00:21:00,639 --> 00:21:04,006
He has become
an anti-superhero.

428
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:06,068
So we just gotta come up
with a cape

429
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:08,944
for the Big J.

430
00:21:08,981 --> 00:21:11,347
If we can just get him
to do some good stuff, though,

431
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:13,283
you know?
He's got the killing down.

432
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:15,116
Jason's always been
the underdog,

433
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:16,985
and everybody roots
for the underdog.

434
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:19,582
Roday:
It's every nerd's dream to get killed

435
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:21,957
and them come back
as a bad-ass

436
00:21:21,994 --> 00:21:24,258
and start taking out
all the stereotypes

437
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:26,457
that pick on nerds.

438
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:30,195
- Why do you do these stupid things?
- I have to.

439
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:32,726
Carey More: I think he's a little bit
of a madman, perhaps.

440
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:34,796
Well, he seems
a little superhuman also

441
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,933
because he seems
to be able to revive

442
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:40,377
and take almighty blows
with hatchets and stuff.

443
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:43,176
Jason is a kid
who's just too stupid

444
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:44,682
to know that he's dead.

445
00:21:44,717 --> 00:21:46,548
I think it's always
kind of inventive

446
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:49,452
how we would bring Jason back.
I always loved that.

447
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:53,185
It was almost like the cliffhangers
in the old serials.

448
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:55,955
How does he live
to see another day?

449
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,658
Something's gotta bring him back.
Why not lightning, right?

450
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:02,030
We can blow him up.
We can cut him up.

451
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:05,662
We can shoot him up. We can dice him up,
and he comes back for more.

452
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:08,901
It's great that as times change,
audiences change.

453
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:12,536
The creature, the monster, the villain, I
think is allowed to evolve.

454
00:22:12,578 --> 00:22:15,308
Jason is the 21st-century killer.

455
00:22:15,347 --> 00:22:17,645
He's good old blood and guts.

456
00:22:17,683 --> 00:22:19,981
Shepherd:
I think that Jason is both a monster

457
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:22,453
and a victim.
This is a very deep character

458
00:22:22,488 --> 00:22:25,855
that survived this many episodes
in killings and destructions

459
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:28,359
because he's larger than life.

460
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:30,521
He's still that little troubled

461
00:22:30,562 --> 00:22:32,427
mentally-ill boy

462
00:22:32,464 --> 00:22:34,864
trapped in the large body
of a killing machine.

463
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,802
He's become iconic in our lives.

464
00:22:38,837 --> 00:22:41,738
Jason has no expiration date.

465
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:48,836
(whimpering)

466
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:56,282
(screams)

467
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,525
12 movies in three decades?

468
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,085
That's enough sequels
to rival box-office legends

469
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:06,825
like James Bond or Godzilla.

470
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:08,765
"Friday the 13th" defined

471
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:11,565
what is considered
the modern-day slasher.

472
00:23:11,603 --> 00:23:13,798
Looking at this guy,
it's no wonder why.

473
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,501
But you know what?
It takes more than a body count

474
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:18,840
to make a "Friday the 13th" movie.

475
00:23:22,748 --> 00:23:26,184
The formula is pretty specific
with a "Friday the 13th" movie.

476
00:23:26,218 --> 00:23:28,243
The first thing you need
in a "Friday the 13th" film

477
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:30,278
is nubile young flesh.

478
00:23:30,322 --> 00:23:34,224
You have a bunch of teenagers
and they cannot be accessible

479
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:36,159
by adult power authorities.

480
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:37,924
They can't come in
and save them.

481
00:23:37,963 --> 00:23:40,898
You have to have a reason
for the kids to be out in the woods.

482
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:43,629
It's the " Let's run out
into the woods,"

483
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:45,796
and, " Ooh!
There's a killer loose."

484
00:23:45,838 --> 00:23:48,898
- The crazy old bastard.
- (screams)

485
00:23:48,941 --> 00:23:51,535
I'm the messenger of God.

486
00:23:51,577 --> 00:23:54,910
You're doomed if you stay here.

487
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:57,780
These movies are made
for teenagers.

488
00:23:57,816 --> 00:24:01,775
And so the point of view is
that anyone who is over a certain age

489
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,118
or in a position of authority
cannot be trusted,

490
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:05,589
because that's
how teenagers feel.

491
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:07,922
Steel:
They have almost, like, one

492
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,622
of each type of personality.

493
00:24:10,662 --> 00:24:13,324
So that no matter
who you are

494
00:24:13,365 --> 00:24:16,391
looking at the movie, you can
relate to one of those characters.

495
00:24:16,435 --> 00:24:18,835
Cunningham: We want to have
these sort of beautiful teenagers

496
00:24:18,871 --> 00:24:20,862
but which include all the stereotypes.

497
00:24:20,906 --> 00:24:24,034
You know, the fat guy
and the high school jock

498
00:24:24,076 --> 00:24:26,169
and the pretty cheerleader

499
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:28,577
and then the girl
with brown hair

500
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:30,707
who is sort of soulful.

501
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:34,651
The obnoxious teenager
who you just want to die so bad,

502
00:24:34,686 --> 00:24:36,153
and when he dies, you all cheer.

503
00:24:36,188 --> 00:24:37,849
(laughs)

504
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,721
(gasps)

505
00:24:39,758 --> 00:24:43,421
I think every "Friday the 13th"
has to have the "promiscuous" girl

506
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:46,056
who is caught doing
something naughty

507
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:47,565
and she pays.

508
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,261
She's usually the first one to go.

509
00:24:50,302 --> 00:24:52,998
And then they are picked off
one by one

510
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:55,905
and you have to figure out
as many different ways

511
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:58,876
of making the teenagers dumb

512
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:01,243
without being really stupid.

513
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,477
Because the great thing about
"Friday the 13th" and other horror films

514
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:06,984
is it gives a lot of people
in the audience a chance

515
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:09,249
to be way smarter
than the characters.

516
00:25:09,288 --> 00:25:12,587
There has to be teenagers
having sex

517
00:25:12,624 --> 00:25:15,388
and getting killed
while they're having sex.

518
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:17,759
Barton:
Jason likes to get you

519
00:25:17,796 --> 00:25:19,957
when you're that much aroused.

520
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:22,228
It's like he takes
your sexual energy,

521
00:25:22,267 --> 00:25:24,235
then he fucks you
with his machete.

522
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:26,999
For the most part,
the less sex you have,

523
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,303
the higher chance
you have of living.

524
00:25:29,341 --> 00:25:31,741
Also has to be in the film:
a pair of breasts

525
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:33,176
every 15 minutes.

526
00:25:33,212 --> 00:25:35,772
It's show time.

527
00:25:35,814 --> 00:25:38,749
We were kind of short
on the breast thing, I think.

528
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:41,252
I can only count about three.

529
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:44,084
Three breasts?
We need more.

530
00:25:44,122 --> 00:25:47,216
I needed the T&A for me.
To hell with the audience.

531
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:49,352
And then of course,
the important ingredient

532
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:52,261
- is Jason.
- (girl screaming)

533
00:25:53,765 --> 00:25:57,098
Jason is an unstoppable force
of nature.

534
00:25:57,135 --> 00:25:59,262
It's interesting how
he could just walk

535
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:01,204
and nobody could ever
get away from him.

536
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,040
It also kind of seems like
he's everywhere at once... at one time.

537
00:26:05,077 --> 00:26:07,375
He notices everybody
all of a sudden

538
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:09,972
when they're just gonna
have a great time...

539
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:11,277
(imitates blade cutting)

540
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:13,284
And if you go back
and remember what it was

541
00:26:13,318 --> 00:26:15,149
that caused Jason's drowning,

542
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:17,815
it was teenagers canoodling
and not watching.

543
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:20,723
If you're screwing,
you get killed.

544
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:23,819
We weren't doing anything.
We were just messing ar... ugh!

545
00:26:23,862 --> 00:26:25,762
You have sex, die.
That's the premise.

546
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:27,264
That's the underlying theme

547
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:30,268
going through
the "Friday the 13th" movies.

548
00:26:30,302 --> 00:26:32,896
I didn't have sex until I was 30
because of Jason.

549
00:26:32,938 --> 00:26:36,101
That motherfucker was the best
contraceptive a guy like me could have.

550
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:39,770
Slasher movies particularly
are like Broadway musicals.

551
00:26:39,811 --> 00:26:42,245
You can't go too long
without a song.

552
00:26:42,281 --> 00:26:45,739
You can't go more than
10 minutes without a kill.

553
00:26:45,784 --> 00:26:48,582
Kids went to see these movies
to see kids get killed.

554
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,316
The kills have to be
interesting and unique.

555
00:26:51,356 --> 00:26:53,449
And even the cast,

556
00:26:53,492 --> 00:26:56,484
the kids would come up to us,
"How am I gonna die?"

557
00:26:56,528 --> 00:26:58,291
I think that's what
audiences came to see.

558
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,764
How is the next guy
gonna get it?

559
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,461
(screaming)

560
00:27:03,502 --> 00:27:05,527
Help, somebody help me!

561
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:08,095
Charles: It's pure fantasy
and we know it's fantasy.

562
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,835
These films are better

563
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:12,537
than the gory

564
00:27:12,577 --> 00:27:15,205
modern killing films

565
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:18,182
that are made
to look so realistic.

566
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:21,344
Usually at the end
of the movie there's some sort of

567
00:27:21,386 --> 00:27:23,684
a jump scare.

568
00:27:23,722 --> 00:27:27,385
The famous ending scene
was not in the original script.

569
00:27:27,426 --> 00:27:29,394
They really didn't have
an ending so I said to Sean,

570
00:27:29,428 --> 00:27:31,953
"Why don't we have Jason
jump out of the lake

571
00:27:31,997 --> 00:27:33,464
and attack her?"

572
00:27:33,498 --> 00:27:35,693
Lehman:
Alice has this look of hope

573
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:38,066
and she's just trailing
her fingers in the water.

574
00:27:38,103 --> 00:27:41,129
And at the moment
when the strings just swell...

575
00:27:41,173 --> 00:27:43,971
(shrieking)

576
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:46,341
(screams)

577
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:49,245
Bam!
That's where the trick is played.

578
00:27:49,281 --> 00:27:51,875
The reason I think this has
gone is it transcends

579
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:53,612
a lot of different ages.

580
00:27:53,652 --> 00:27:56,018
And the music is important

581
00:27:56,054 --> 00:27:58,386
because you're sort of heightened
and scared

582
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:01,756
just with the music
and the visual all at the same time.

583
00:28:01,793 --> 00:28:03,556
Music and score
is another character.

584
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:06,223
It's every bit as important
as Jason.

585
00:28:06,264 --> 00:28:09,461
Harry Manfredini
took the minimalist approach

586
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:11,025
and it works
to a perfect effect.

587
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:13,833
Music in a horror movie
is crucial.

588
00:28:13,872 --> 00:28:17,831
It can make or break a film,
and his score in that movie

589
00:28:17,876 --> 00:28:19,741
was just untouchable.

590
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:21,507
(softly)
Kill kill kill kill...

591
00:28:21,546 --> 00:28:23,207
(imitating soundtrack)

592
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:25,716
(nonsense noises)

593
00:28:27,753 --> 00:28:30,881
- No no, that doesn't sound right.
- That's not good. Let's start again.

594
00:28:30,922 --> 00:28:34,881
And if you go to the end of the film,
you'll see a very close-up

595
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:36,917
of Betsy Palmer's

596
00:28:36,962 --> 00:28:38,953
Mrs. Voorhees' mouth,

597
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:40,760
where she's saying

598
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:44,030
to herself, " Kill her, Mommy.
Kill her, Mommy."

599
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:46,435
And it goes back and forth
between her voice

600
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:50,100
and supposedly Jason's voice.

601
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:51,939
And I said, "Bingo, that's it."

602
00:28:51,977 --> 00:28:54,070
So then I just went

603
00:28:54,112 --> 00:28:56,205
and I took the consonant sound

604
00:28:56,248 --> 00:28:58,876
of the K, "ki" from killer

605
00:28:58,917 --> 00:29:01,215
and "ma" from mommy.

606
00:29:01,253 --> 00:29:03,448
I went up
to a microphone and just went

607
00:29:03,488 --> 00:29:05,820
"ki... ma."

608
00:29:05,857 --> 00:29:08,485
And we ran it through
something called an echoplex,

609
00:29:08,527 --> 00:29:12,463
and it ended up coming...
(imitates soundtrack)

610
00:29:12,497 --> 00:29:14,362
When you hear that...
(imitates soundtrack)

611
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,731
you know you've got
a"Friday the 13th" movie.

612
00:29:16,768 --> 00:29:20,260
It created all the conventions
of the slasher films that followed,

613
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:22,739
pretty much using the template
that was established

614
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:24,332
on that first film in 1980.

615
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:31,338
Obviously,
Jason Voorhees is a true

616
00:29:31,383 --> 00:29:33,783
worldwide icon.

617
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:36,310
One could say that he's
as famous as the Beatles

618
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:39,812
or Madonna,
a veritable rock-star slasher

619
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:42,258
if there ever was one.
And what rock star

620
00:29:42,294 --> 00:29:44,956
would be complete
without a greatest-hits compilation?

621
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:47,794
Does Jason have one, you ask?

622
00:29:47,833 --> 00:29:49,994
Let's ask this guy.

623
00:29:50,035 --> 00:29:52,230
- (bones crack)
- (screams)

624
00:29:53,305 --> 00:29:55,466
What are you doing,
douchebag?

625
00:29:55,507 --> 00:29:59,034
So Jason will kill with anything
he could get his hands on.

626
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:01,443
Lynch: It was another one
that you sit in the audience

627
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,472
and watch it with a crowd
and everyone just goes, "Oh, dude!"

628
00:30:04,516 --> 00:30:06,882
(gasps)

629
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:09,512
The obvious most memorable moment
is with Kevin Bacon.

630
00:30:09,554 --> 00:30:11,920
He's like on his knees
under the bed.

631
00:30:11,957 --> 00:30:13,788
Me and my buddy Taso
are under there

632
00:30:13,825 --> 00:30:16,123
and I'm pushing
the arrow through

633
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:18,356
and Taso was
pumping the blood,

634
00:30:18,396 --> 00:30:21,388
but an accident occurred.
The tubes separated

635
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:24,459
from Taso's pump,
so he grabbed it and blew in it.

636
00:30:24,503 --> 00:30:28,234
That's what made
the blood shoot out and gurgle.

637
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:32,232
My favorite kill of all:
Mrs. Voorhees slo-mo.

638
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:33,972
It doesn't get better than that.

639
00:30:34,012 --> 00:30:36,480
- The ultimate kill by Alice.
- (screaming)

640
00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:38,538
(mimics knife thrust)

641
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:41,518
We actually made a cast
of Betsy Palmer's head.

642
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:43,418
I attached it with toothpicks.

643
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:45,821
So the toothpicks
were just kind of holding it in place,

644
00:30:45,857 --> 00:30:47,882
knowing that when I whacked it
with that machete,

645
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:49,416
it would go through
the toothpicks.

646
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:52,897
But if you watch the movie
when Betsy Palmer is decapitated,

647
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:56,560
her hands come up into frame
and kind of like a grabbing there.

648
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:59,900
They're Taso's hands
with hairy knuckles.

649
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:03,237
I don't have hair
on the back of my hands like he did.

650
00:31:03,275 --> 00:31:06,210
I thought that was
a little weird in one shot.

651
00:31:07,546 --> 00:31:09,537
One of the things that turned out
wildly effective

652
00:31:09,581 --> 00:31:11,378
was the back-cracking
of the sheriff character.

653
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:12,849
- (screaming)
- (bones crack)

654
00:31:12,884 --> 00:31:14,374
They dug a hole

655
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:17,547
and those weren't my legs.
They had a guy head down

656
00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:19,454
in the hole with his legs
behind me.

657
00:31:19,491 --> 00:31:22,289
But just that whole idea
of bending somebody all the way back

658
00:31:22,327 --> 00:31:26,195
and hearing all this...
(knuckles crack) sound

659
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:27,528
drove them crazy.

660
00:31:27,566 --> 00:31:30,660
A little sound design, a little
screaming, it all turned out great.

661
00:31:30,702 --> 00:31:32,431
Wheelchair death in "Part 2,"

662
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,630
that was just fucked up.

663
00:31:33,672 --> 00:31:35,435
He already gets your sympathy

664
00:31:35,473 --> 00:31:37,805
'cause you're like,
"Oh, he's in a wheelchair."

665
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:39,810
But then he's gonna get laid.

666
00:31:39,844 --> 00:31:43,143
And then Jason just goes,
"You're screwed!"

667
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:45,513
And not only does he get hit
in the face,

668
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,882
but he gets pushed backwards
down the stairs,

669
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,320
and the camera does this
great thing where it goes, "Weeee!"

670
00:31:54,826 --> 00:31:58,592
- (screams, gagging)
- (grunts)

671
00:32:00,365 --> 00:32:02,993
Bonnie Hellman:
I had a track around my neck

672
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:06,265
with a flexible steel blade
that pushed from the back

673
00:32:06,304 --> 00:32:09,831
and then a false neck over it,
which took hours to put on.

674
00:32:09,874 --> 00:32:12,035
Of course,
I was eating a banana

675
00:32:12,077 --> 00:32:14,773
at the time, so they had my mouth
full of banana and blood.

676
00:32:14,813 --> 00:32:17,805
It was such a messy little death.

677
00:32:19,818 --> 00:32:22,286
Now cut that out right now.
That's not funny!

678
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:29,390
There was a cable
that was actually set up on the post

679
00:32:29,427 --> 00:32:32,419
that ran across to where
she was standing.

680
00:32:32,464 --> 00:32:35,399
The gun was rigged in such a way
that I actually hooked the gun

681
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:37,526
onto the cable and shot it

682
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:39,560
so it went straight
down the cable.

683
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:42,505
And in 3D with the glasses,
it's incredible.

684
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,371
We had to do it in one take

685
00:32:44,409 --> 00:32:46,604
because the minute I hit the water,

686
00:32:46,645 --> 00:32:49,637
the little prosthetic
would absorb the water

687
00:32:49,681 --> 00:32:51,342
and just kind of slide off.

688
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:53,180
The hedge clippers to the eyes...

689
00:32:53,218 --> 00:32:55,846
that girl had the best rack,
the best death

690
00:32:55,887 --> 00:32:58,355
and her last name
really had Voorhees in it.

691
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:01,723
That was a pretty horrific
way to go.

692
00:33:04,329 --> 00:33:06,456
That shish-kebab scene

693
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:08,398
is so original.

694
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:11,027
(gasps, grunts)

695
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:14,766
They attached this back to me

696
00:33:14,806 --> 00:33:17,366
and then put the spear
through the latex

697
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:20,071
and had the blood
pumping out.

698
00:33:20,111 --> 00:33:22,841
And they had a bed

699
00:33:22,881 --> 00:33:24,246
which had a hole in it

700
00:33:24,282 --> 00:33:26,750
and then she just
kind of came in, sat

701
00:33:26,785 --> 00:33:28,412
and then put her head back.

702
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:30,648
It looked like I was lying
on top of her.

703
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:33,817
Before it got butchered
by the ratings board,

704
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:37,350
there was this amazing shot
where you saw the real girl

705
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:38,987
doing the last moment
that she could have

706
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:41,498
trying to push
the guy off of her.

707
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:45,230
It was such an effective
disturbing sequence.

708
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,261
You imagine Jason down there
like, "I can't wait."

709
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:49,364
What about the dude who goes
into a handstand

710
00:33:49,407 --> 00:33:51,238
and gets the axe
right down the middle?

711
00:33:53,345 --> 00:33:56,109
(gasps)

712
00:33:56,147 --> 00:33:57,944
(screams)

713
00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:02,713
(muffled scream)

714
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:04,244
He took my head by force

715
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:07,918
and slammed it through
the wall of the Winnebago.

716
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:11,053
And how they actually did that
is they filmed it underwater.

717
00:34:11,096 --> 00:34:12,893
They shot it in slo-mo,

718
00:34:12,931 --> 00:34:14,899
pushing through
this piece of plastic.

719
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:17,663
You start asking yourself
is there something wrong with you

720
00:34:17,702 --> 00:34:20,762
when you're spending your day
thinking up ways to murder people,

721
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:23,069
- but I got over it.
- They used a real spear.

722
00:34:23,108 --> 00:34:24,939
And it missed me
by a speck.

723
00:34:24,976 --> 00:34:26,739
(screams)

724
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:28,939
(water gurgling)

725
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:33,713
- I like it when he crushes heads.
- (grunts)

726
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:36,721
We had a string
go straight to the eye

727
00:34:36,755 --> 00:34:38,245
so we could just pull the string

728
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:39,722
and the eye would pop out
of the socket,

729
00:34:39,758 --> 00:34:41,783
come straight
down the line toward camera.

730
00:34:41,826 --> 00:34:45,353
That is horrifically gory,

731
00:34:45,397 --> 00:34:47,922
but it's classic Jason.

732
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:50,560
Ryder:
My favorite kill in "Jason X"

733
00:34:50,602 --> 00:34:53,696
is where he dunks
that chick's head in the ice.

734
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:56,070
We spent a lot of time on that...
prepping it.

735
00:34:56,107 --> 00:34:58,268
And we not only
just storyboarded it out,

736
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:01,472
but we had to have a false sink
with the camera underneath

737
00:35:01,513 --> 00:35:04,607
and a glass for the water
because I wanted to be able to see

738
00:35:04,649 --> 00:35:07,618
the face come toward
the camera, not frozen.

739
00:35:07,652 --> 00:35:11,418
- And then...
- Bam! Face salad.

740
00:35:11,456 --> 00:35:14,425
(shatters)

741
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:17,155
That was technically
our most difficult kill.

742
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:19,993
I think his favorite thing
is smashing heads together.

743
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:21,760
My favorite Jason kill
that I've ever done

744
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,859
is the sleeping bag.

745
00:35:23,902 --> 00:35:26,803
He bashed her against the tree,
I think, at least five times,

746
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:29,306
but we minimized it
to once.

747
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,638
And that was
actually more impactful.

748
00:35:33,511 --> 00:35:36,378
Savini: I cut his brain in half
in "Part 4." I created the monster.

749
00:35:36,414 --> 00:35:39,645
Thank you for letting me
kill the monster.

750
00:35:39,684 --> 00:35:41,777
- And this is...
- Joseph Zito.

751
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,913
- The...
- Director of " Friday the 13th

752
00:35:43,955 --> 00:35:47,721
- Final Chapter."
- I'm Erich Anderson and I played Rob.

753
00:35:47,759 --> 00:35:50,523
And we're at the house
where we shot the movie.

754
00:35:50,562 --> 00:35:52,723
This is really the site
of the death of Jason.

755
00:35:52,764 --> 00:35:54,288
Right there.

756
00:35:54,332 --> 00:35:56,800
Zito: We have a big
special-effects makeup group.

757
00:35:56,835 --> 00:35:58,735
And they're all around.

758
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,328
They're all around
and they're pumping blood

759
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:02,305
and moving the tongue

760
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,707
and working all
of the parts.

761
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:09,509
The mask hits the ground,
and the machete is picked up here,

762
00:36:09,547 --> 00:36:12,539
and Tommy ends up
taking the machete

763
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:16,350
and killing Jason
to die die die.

764
00:36:16,387 --> 00:36:18,252
Girl: Tommy!

765
00:36:25,897 --> 00:36:27,797
You maybe were expecting
something quick.

766
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:30,392
Tommy hits him in the head
with the blade, the end?

767
00:36:30,435 --> 00:36:31,868
No, he slides down the blade.

768
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:35,569
(gagging, screaming)

769
00:36:50,054 --> 00:36:52,045
(screaming)

770
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,221
Not too shabby.

771
00:36:58,263 --> 00:37:01,323
But creating Jason's handiwork
is never an easy task.

772
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:04,062
Neither was creating
Jason Voorhees.

773
00:37:04,102 --> 00:37:05,763
I should know.

774
00:37:05,803 --> 00:37:09,637
So what does it take to create
an unforgettable movie villain?

775
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:16,436
I came up with the idea
for Jason's name

776
00:37:16,481 --> 00:37:18,449
'cause originally it was
gonna be Josh,

777
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:21,008
but the more I worked
on the film and the creepier

778
00:37:21,052 --> 00:37:22,883
the whole subject of that got,

779
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:25,412
I stuck with the "J"
and went to Jason.

780
00:37:25,456 --> 00:37:27,151
Tommy Savini,
who of course

781
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:29,716
did all those
fabulous special effects,

782
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:32,457
gave me some Polaroids
to look at.

783
00:37:32,497 --> 00:37:35,227
And he said,
"That's your son,

784
00:37:35,266 --> 00:37:38,394
Jason.
He's a mongoloid."

785
00:37:38,436 --> 00:37:40,563
I said, "He's what?"

786
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:43,870
His features were really a guy I used
to see in my neighborhood,

787
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:47,173
a homeless drunk guy,
one ear was lower than the other.

788
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:49,907
He was almost
a Quasimodo kind of guy.

789
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:53,614
Lehman:
The first thing they do is they take

790
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:55,676
a cast of your head.

791
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,178
There was fake teeth.
There was a glass eye.

792
00:37:59,223 --> 00:38:00,952
One thing people often ask is,

793
00:38:00,992 --> 00:38:03,460
"Was it specially made
to go underwater?"

794
00:38:03,494 --> 00:38:05,189
and stuff like that.

795
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:06,662
No, it was just...

796
00:38:06,698 --> 00:38:09,428
it was a latex prosthetic.

797
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:12,368
Daskawisz:
Once I put the bag over my head

798
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:15,031
and I ran in the woods,
I couldn't see anything

799
00:38:15,073 --> 00:38:17,200
'cause the bag flopped
back and forth.

800
00:38:17,241 --> 00:38:20,677
And he came up with this idea...
we'll put double-faced tape here

801
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:24,204
and here, and we'll hold it
right close to your eye.

802
00:38:24,248 --> 00:38:26,773
This way you'll see where
you're going, and it worked great.

803
00:38:26,818 --> 00:38:28,786
But from taking the tape
on and off,

804
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,653
I had started to develop burns
on my face.

805
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,020
Gillette:
First they cut off all your hair,

806
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:37,857
and then they started to build
the face with little rubber forms

807
00:38:37,895 --> 00:38:40,830
they would glue on.
And they sent me to a dentist

808
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:43,732
that created dental plates
that would go in

809
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:45,736
that were sort of
the worst dental problems

810
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,203
anyone could ever have.

811
00:38:47,238 --> 00:38:49,138
And they built the beard
and the hair,

812
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:50,970
and they taped off the eye.

813
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:54,137
It's sort of painful
to have all this stuff put on.

814
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:58,137
The scene of "Friday the 13th: 2"
where Jason

815
00:38:58,182 --> 00:39:00,241
comes careening
through the window...

816
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:04,243
they built a platform
outside the house.

817
00:39:04,288 --> 00:39:07,553
The platform was probably
four feet long.

818
00:39:07,592 --> 00:39:10,561
So we coordinated
how many steps it takes.

819
00:39:10,595 --> 00:39:13,393
So one, two, three... aggh!

820
00:39:13,431 --> 00:39:16,025
(screaming)

821
00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:21,370
At the time when this was created,
there was a serial killer

822
00:39:21,406 --> 00:39:23,101
running around in Texas.

823
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:25,666
And he was killing people

824
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,371
with a potato sack on his head.

825
00:39:27,412 --> 00:39:29,778
This could have been
the inspiration,

826
00:39:29,814 --> 00:39:32,977
which I believe the potato sack
is a little scarier

827
00:39:33,017 --> 00:39:34,780
than the hockey mask,

828
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:36,582
which of course
is now iconic.

829
00:39:36,621 --> 00:39:39,749
Brooker: I didn't get any direction
from Steve Miner at all.

830
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:42,885
He actually came to me and said,
"You're just a mindless killer.

831
00:39:42,927 --> 00:39:46,021
You're like
the living version of 'Jaws." '

832
00:39:46,064 --> 00:39:48,328
I used to have to go in
and do about six,

833
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:50,027
sometimes seven hours
of makeup.

834
00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:53,560
And it was 11 different appliances

835
00:39:53,604 --> 00:39:55,367
that they glued to my face.

836
00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:57,840
The bad part about it was
that as soon as they'd finished,

837
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:00,343
it was usually lunchtime
and I couldn't eat.

838
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:04,109
So they used to give me
Tiger's Milk through a straw.

839
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:07,174
Judie Aronson: Jason in our film
was played by Ted White.

840
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:10,517
And his way
of keeping the character

841
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:13,115
was kind of separating himself
from everybody else.

842
00:40:13,157 --> 00:40:16,126
I don't remember really him having
a conversation with anybody.

843
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,060
I actually turned it down
to begin with,

844
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:20,587
and later on I did accept it.

845
00:40:20,631 --> 00:40:24,567
After I accepted it, I did go down
and rent two of the "Jasons,"

846
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:26,797
and I watched Jason itself,

847
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:28,931
how he moved and so forth.

848
00:40:28,973 --> 00:40:31,942
And I felt I'd like to play him
a little bit different.

849
00:40:31,976 --> 00:40:34,206
I'd like for him
to move a little bit different.

850
00:40:34,245 --> 00:40:36,645
Another way of doing it
would be the fast move,

851
00:40:36,681 --> 00:40:38,808
to move faster,
and that's how I portrayed him.

852
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:41,284
That's what I wanted to do
with him.

853
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:44,083
Even when I was in full costume,
makeup, everything,

854
00:40:44,122 --> 00:40:46,556
I stayed away
from the cast completely.

855
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:48,821
I'd sit by myself on the set.

856
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,691
I just stayed away
from everybody.

857
00:40:50,728 --> 00:40:53,128
And I tried to keep in character
as much as possible.

858
00:40:53,164 --> 00:40:55,189
I liked the mystique

859
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:57,258
of being by myself,

860
00:40:57,301 --> 00:40:59,667
not being close to anybody.

861
00:40:59,704 --> 00:41:01,899
The scene upstairs where
they hit me over the head

862
00:41:01,939 --> 00:41:04,430
with a television set,

863
00:41:04,475 --> 00:41:07,911
little did I know that that
TV set was gonna stay on my head.

864
00:41:07,945 --> 00:41:10,641
I had no idea where I was.
I couldn't see out of that thing.

865
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:13,548
It was just a hand feeling
for the stairway.

866
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:16,212
You know, I was offered
the fifth one and sixth one.

867
00:41:16,254 --> 00:41:19,052
I could have done either one of them
and I turned 'em down.

868
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,581
I'm sorry now
that I did turn them down.

869
00:41:21,626 --> 00:41:25,187
Morga: In "5," I actually
played an impostor of Jason,

870
00:41:25,229 --> 00:41:28,221
and I did have a couple moments
where I did

871
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:30,097
play the apparition

872
00:41:30,134 --> 00:41:32,659
of Jason himself,

873
00:41:32,703 --> 00:41:36,298
where those were supposedly
different Jason characters.

874
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,036
I just played Jason
through the whole movie.

875
00:41:39,076 --> 00:41:42,045
In the film, obviously,
they had to distinguish in some way

876
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,674
so they used the blue
for the marks on the mask

877
00:41:45,716 --> 00:41:49,015
for the impostor Jason,
where when I did the actual Jason

878
00:41:49,053 --> 00:41:51,044
I was wearing the real mask

879
00:41:51,088 --> 00:41:53,079
with the red marks on it.

880
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:56,924
The makeup with this particular
character wasn't too intense.

881
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:59,259
The Jason character, though,

882
00:41:59,297 --> 00:42:02,232
was a pullover mask
with the face cut out.

883
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:04,234
All they had to do
was darken my eyes

884
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:05,997
and then put the hockey mask
over it.

885
00:42:06,037 --> 00:42:08,870
We never talked about this.
It's really not in the script.

886
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:11,568
Any motivation...
there isn't any.

887
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:15,545
So I felt Roy was a little disturbed
to begin with.

888
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,515
The first time I put on
the green jumpsuit

889
00:42:18,549 --> 00:42:20,380
and the boots

890
00:42:20,418 --> 00:42:24,218
and I zipped them up,
I looked at myself in the mirror

891
00:42:24,255 --> 00:42:26,553
and I thought, "Is this me?"

892
00:42:26,591 --> 00:42:29,355
Bartalos:
One of the exciting things for me

893
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:32,123
was the creation of Jason's mask.

894
00:42:32,163 --> 00:42:34,427
So we took a hockey mask

895
00:42:34,465 --> 00:42:36,695
and kind of customized it.

896
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:38,964
We basically redesigned

897
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:40,470
some of the ventilation holes.

898
00:42:40,504 --> 00:42:44,440
We created basically
a new positive.

899
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:46,875
From the positive, we made
a big block rubber mold

900
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,936
and from that,
created what's called a buck,

901
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,710
a heavy-duty cement wedge that

902
00:42:51,749 --> 00:42:54,445
on the top
of it has the veneer

903
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:55,975
of the hockey mask

904
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,080
At that point,
using a real heavy duty plastic,

905
00:42:59,123 --> 00:43:01,091
we did what's called
vacuforming.

906
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,786
The vacuforming draws apart

907
00:43:02,827 --> 00:43:05,227
and we pull it out and bang,

908
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:07,390
we get Jason's mask.

909
00:43:07,431 --> 00:43:10,992
C.J. Graham: When we portrayed it,
he got stronger.

910
00:43:11,035 --> 00:43:14,801
Every opportunity
of a fight scene or a kill

911
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:18,240
enhanced his knowledge
of killing or his strength.

912
00:43:18,276 --> 00:43:21,609
Every time he was shot and put down,
he came back stronger the next time.

913
00:43:25,683 --> 00:43:28,277
You know, Tom was very adamant.
He did not want a machine on stage.

914
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,549
When you were on set,
he wanted to make sure

915
00:43:30,588 --> 00:43:32,613
there was some human contact

916
00:43:32,657 --> 00:43:34,682
and people could relate to it.

917
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:37,717
Jason just is indestructible.
When you put the costume on,

918
00:43:37,762 --> 00:43:40,959
you really project it, and the
projection had to be through the body...

919
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:44,490
100% through the body.
Just a simplistic little movement

920
00:43:44,535 --> 00:43:46,127
would create fear.

921
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,195
As soon as the mask
comes down,

922
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:50,366
it's very simple
to get into the character.

923
00:43:50,408 --> 00:43:52,899
Nice thing about it
is you get to kill 17, 18 people,

924
00:43:52,944 --> 00:43:54,536
you don't go to prison.

925
00:43:58,282 --> 00:44:01,046
Buechler:
Every scar, every rip, every tear

926
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:02,950
that Jason ever had was

927
00:44:02,987 --> 00:44:06,889
in the Jason
that we created for "Part VII."

928
00:44:06,924 --> 00:44:10,223
As far as playing the character,
I wanted to just do what felt natural.

929
00:44:10,261 --> 00:44:13,162
My goal was
to just add some more life

930
00:44:13,197 --> 00:44:16,724
to the character,
even though he is kind of a zombie.

931
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,930
People ask me, " Why does
the makeup change so much

932
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:23,304
from movie to movie? The hockey mask
changes and everything else."

933
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:26,174
Basically, it's because it's
a different makeup-effects person

934
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:28,041
who designs it.

935
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,240
The first movie I did,
"Part VII,"

936
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:32,647
the makeup was real extensive,
many pieces.

937
00:44:32,683 --> 00:44:36,141
It took about three
and a half hours a day.

938
00:44:36,187 --> 00:44:39,281
It was hard to work in,
but fantastic makeup.

939
00:44:40,391 --> 00:44:42,586
ber Jason...
it was an entire

940
00:44:42,626 --> 00:44:45,060
one-piece suit

941
00:44:45,096 --> 00:44:48,361
that did have a zipper
in the back, but very well concealed.

942
00:44:48,399 --> 00:44:51,459
On the suit,
it limited my motion a lot

943
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:53,970
with the arm and the leg

944
00:44:54,005 --> 00:44:55,870
that had the metallic pieces.

945
00:44:55,906 --> 00:44:59,364
I still love the design
of that ber Jason mask.

946
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,878
He brought a lot to the role.

947
00:45:01,912 --> 00:45:05,848
No matter who directed him,
no matter what movie he was in,

948
00:45:05,883 --> 00:45:09,478
you could tell Kane's Jason
from other people's Jason.

949
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,921
Having Kane Hodder
play Jason four times

950
00:45:12,957 --> 00:45:15,687
really established him
as Jason.

951
00:45:15,726 --> 00:45:19,093
I think stepping into it,
I was a little leery,

952
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:22,156
because a lot of the feedback
the fans were putting out there

953
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:24,167
was negative, I think,
in the beginning.

954
00:45:24,201 --> 00:45:26,465
But then when the movie
came out,

955
00:45:26,504 --> 00:45:28,301
it became very very positive.

956
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:31,035
They were big shoes,
but I'm a big guy.

957
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:33,441
I remember the first day
he showed up on the set,

958
00:45:33,477 --> 00:45:36,139
the first night we shot him,
and I turned around,

959
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,011
and there he was in full glory.

960
00:45:38,049 --> 00:45:40,711
I mean, his boots were
like this thick,

961
00:45:40,751 --> 00:45:43,811
and then you put on
everything else that he's wearing

962
00:45:43,854 --> 00:45:45,719
and he was 6'8 ".

963
00:45:45,756 --> 00:45:48,725
I'm not kidding you,
he scared the hell out of me.

964
00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:50,920
My portrayal of Jason

965
00:45:50,961 --> 00:45:53,828
showed another side
that you don't normally get to see.

966
00:45:53,864 --> 00:45:56,355
In "Freddy vs. Jason,"
you see him actually interact

967
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,166
with his mother,
and you see him confronted by fears.

968
00:46:00,204 --> 00:46:02,331
I just went back
to my childhood,

969
00:46:02,373 --> 00:46:04,933
and I think I thought
a lot about Frankenstein...

970
00:46:04,975 --> 00:46:07,341
not really alive,
but not really dead.

971
00:46:07,378 --> 00:46:10,245
Even if you look at the movements,
the walk and stuff like that,

972
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:12,875
I think I used a little bit
of Frankenstein.

973
00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:16,011
Even though people think
he just kind of stands there

974
00:46:16,053 --> 00:46:17,816
and lumbers along
with his machete,

975
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,187
you have to feel
that there's a physical force

976
00:46:20,224 --> 00:46:24,217
that could actually be as evil
and as powerful as he is.

977
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:30,997
Ew! Sorry, buddy.

978
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:33,663
I hope it was over quickly.

979
00:46:33,704 --> 00:46:35,137
The truth is,
like this guy,

980
00:46:35,172 --> 00:46:37,299
most people don't survive
their encounter

981
00:46:37,341 --> 00:46:39,536
with our murderous mongoloid.

982
00:46:39,577 --> 00:46:42,842
Still, there have been a few
that gave Jason quite a headache.

983
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,111
You know, the people that insist
on not going down without a fight.

984
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:47,811
It's a small group,

985
00:46:47,852 --> 00:46:51,515
but they certainly gave Jason
a big run for his money.

986
00:46:51,555 --> 00:46:53,819
Or his machete.

987
00:46:53,858 --> 00:46:56,793
So whether it's Alice or it's Ginny
or it's Chris or any of these girls

988
00:46:56,827 --> 00:46:59,955
who make it to the end, they usually
have some common characteristics.

989
00:46:59,997 --> 00:47:02,227
The most important
is their chastity,

990
00:47:02,266 --> 00:47:03,756
their purity.

991
00:47:03,801 --> 00:47:06,895
They're generally not there
to just party.

992
00:47:06,937 --> 00:47:08,996
And as a result,
they get rewarded

993
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:11,030
by being able
to live through it.

994
00:47:11,075 --> 00:47:13,839
It was usually the outcast.
It was usually the good girl,

995
00:47:13,878 --> 00:47:16,278
the one who didn't smoke pot,
who didn't have premarital sex.

996
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:18,372
She was always the one
who was able to take him on.

997
00:47:18,415 --> 00:47:21,145
And I think that goes back
to the most primitive storytelling

998
00:47:21,185 --> 00:47:22,652
of just good versus evil.

999
00:47:22,686 --> 00:47:25,985
The archetypes for them are
the innocent girl next door.

1000
00:47:26,023 --> 00:47:27,923
I never felt like a victim.

1001
00:47:27,958 --> 00:47:30,483
As a matter of fact,
I felt very empowered by the role.

1002
00:47:30,528 --> 00:47:33,827
The women were stronger
in this film than the guys were.

1003
00:47:33,864 --> 00:47:37,391
She's a typical, regular gal.

1004
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:39,561
She's like any teenager

1005
00:47:39,603 --> 00:47:42,538
or young adult trying

1006
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:44,837
to figure out what they
wanna do with their life.

1007
00:47:44,875 --> 00:47:47,343
She didn't run with the pack

1008
00:47:47,378 --> 00:47:50,040
and she was different.

1009
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,446
But that didn't mean
she was virtuous.

1010
00:47:52,483 --> 00:47:55,646
It just meant she thought things
through differently.

1011
00:47:57,988 --> 00:48:00,422
I would love the opportunity
to come back.

1012
00:48:00,457 --> 00:48:02,425
It's so much more satisfying

1013
00:48:02,459 --> 00:48:04,120
to watch a woman

1014
00:48:04,161 --> 00:48:07,130
destroy this tremendous evil.

1015
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:11,032
Amy Steel, she was just so adorable.
She was so girl-next-doorish.

1016
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:14,970
She would probably be
my all-time favorite "Friday" girl.

1017
00:48:15,005 --> 00:48:17,098
To know that I did one
of these films

1018
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:20,201
where they get all these women in
that are so vulnerable

1019
00:48:20,244 --> 00:48:23,042
and to be the one that
people think was strong

1020
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,605
and intelligent is just...
it feels good.

1021
00:48:25,649 --> 00:48:27,617
Ginny was written

1022
00:48:27,651 --> 00:48:29,949
in a more multidimensional
kind of way.

1023
00:48:29,987 --> 00:48:33,479
And there was something a little bit
separate about her than everybody.

1024
00:48:33,524 --> 00:48:36,152
She didn't need a group
of people around her.

1025
00:48:36,193 --> 00:48:39,219
She was strong enough
to stand on her own.

1026
00:48:39,263 --> 00:48:41,231
She wanted to figure it out.

1027
00:48:41,265 --> 00:48:43,165
Well, what would it be like today?

1028
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,135
Some kind of
out-of-control psychopath?

1029
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,934
A frightened retard?

1030
00:48:48,973 --> 00:48:50,770
A child trapped
in a man's body?

1031
00:48:50,808 --> 00:48:54,005
I think my favorite personally
was Lar Park-Lincoln in "Part VII."

1032
00:48:54,044 --> 00:48:56,535
Just the ability
to come in with the mind

1033
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:00,448
and to manipulate Jason like she did...
I mean, she was equal.

1034
00:49:00,484 --> 00:49:03,647
Roday: The genius convention
of adding a character

1035
00:49:03,687 --> 00:49:05,678
with telekinesis

1036
00:49:05,723 --> 00:49:08,157
to give Jason
a new sort of foil

1037
00:49:08,192 --> 00:49:10,285
in the final battle
was pretty fantastic.

1038
00:49:14,965 --> 00:49:17,729
One thing that I didn't want
to do is I didn't want

1039
00:49:17,768 --> 00:49:21,727
to play a psychic, or someone
who felt they had telekinetic abilities,

1040
00:49:21,772 --> 00:49:24,263
like they were someone
going into a stroke

1041
00:49:24,308 --> 00:49:27,368
and doing some
cartoonish version

1042
00:49:27,411 --> 00:49:30,608
of what
she was dealing with.

1043
00:49:30,648 --> 00:49:32,912
Lar Park-Lincoln as Tina,
she's classic.

1044
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:35,851
It was a different take
on the story.

1045
00:49:35,886 --> 00:49:38,150
That character gave it
a great brawl.

1046
00:49:38,188 --> 00:49:41,680
Park-Lincoln: She didn't back down.
She never really ran from him.

1047
00:49:41,725 --> 00:49:44,159
She chased him.
And we had that great street scene

1048
00:49:44,194 --> 00:49:46,924
where she goes right up
to him... I love the twigs

1049
00:49:46,964 --> 00:49:48,295
coming around his legs

1050
00:49:48,332 --> 00:49:51,790
and taking him down
that way.

1051
00:49:51,835 --> 00:49:53,632
The most worthy opponents
of Jason

1052
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:57,232
from the movies that I did...
certainly Tina has to be there,

1053
00:49:57,274 --> 00:50:00,038
because she created
the most damage

1054
00:50:00,077 --> 00:50:02,307
to Jason and survived.

1055
00:50:02,346 --> 00:50:05,782
They also started a trend where like
the surviving girl's "love interest"

1056
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:07,716
started making it through
as well.

1057
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:10,481
I'm honored that I was a survivor.

1058
00:50:12,022 --> 00:50:13,649
If Jason wanted
to bring it on again,

1059
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:15,556
I'd come back.

1060
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:17,219
I would love
to tackle her again.

1061
00:50:17,261 --> 00:50:20,924
Although I think I would do it
with better hair serum.

1062
00:50:20,964 --> 00:50:23,057
So my hair
wouldn't be as frizzy

1063
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,330
as it was throughout
the entire shooting of that film.

1064
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:27,963
I think of the whole series,
I think Tommy Jarvis is probably one

1065
00:50:28,005 --> 00:50:29,768
of Jason's biggest adversaries.

1066
00:50:29,807 --> 00:50:33,334
Jason, don't you remember?

1067
00:50:33,377 --> 00:50:35,845
Remember, Jason?

1068
00:50:38,248 --> 00:50:40,273
Zito:
Tommy's an outsider, like Jason.

1069
00:50:40,317 --> 00:50:42,217
Tommy's a kid
that doesn't fit in.

1070
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:44,880
So there is a relationship
between Tommy and Jason

1071
00:50:44,922 --> 00:50:47,914
when Tommy takes on
the persona and impersonates him

1072
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:51,121
as a weapon to undo him.

1073
00:50:52,996 --> 00:50:55,430
I would love to have gone up
against Corey Feldman

1074
00:50:55,466 --> 00:50:59,425
just 'cause I'd like
to squeeze his head until it pops.

1075
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,597
Tommy had a very unique
relationship to Jason

1076
00:51:01,638 --> 00:51:03,868
because at least at the end
of "Part 5," he actually

1077
00:51:03,907 --> 00:51:06,239
looks like he will become
the next Jason.

1078
00:51:06,276 --> 00:51:08,938
In "Part 4," which Corey Feldman
played so beautifully,

1079
00:51:08,979 --> 00:51:11,209
he ends up
in an insane asylum.

1080
00:51:11,248 --> 00:51:14,149
Is he monster or victim?
Well, he's a little bit of both.

1081
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,952
He just wants to kill everybody.

1082
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:21,617
He didn't get me though.
I ran him over with a tractor...

1083
00:51:21,658 --> 00:51:24,149
one of the very few brothers
that survived

1084
00:51:24,194 --> 00:51:26,059
the "Friday the 13th" series,
by the way.

1085
00:51:26,096 --> 00:51:27,757
They wanted
to kill me off in "Part VI,"

1086
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:30,631
but we said,
"Nope, not doing that to us."

1087
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:32,134
(screams)

1088
00:51:32,169 --> 00:51:35,866
John LeMay's character...
another good one

1089
00:51:35,906 --> 00:51:37,498
because we had
a hell of a fight.

1090
00:51:37,541 --> 00:51:39,008
I did put up
a pretty good fight.

1091
00:51:39,042 --> 00:51:41,010
The electricity's going off
everywhere,

1092
00:51:41,044 --> 00:51:44,104
and I'm just breathing heavy
and sweating a lot

1093
00:51:44,148 --> 00:51:46,844
and smacking the hell out
of him. It was fun,

1094
00:51:46,884 --> 00:51:50,115
but surviving Jason is an honor.

1095
00:51:50,154 --> 00:51:53,612
In my obituary,
it'll say " John survived Jason,

1096
00:51:53,657 --> 00:51:55,852
but could not survive life."

1097
00:51:55,893 --> 00:51:58,885
Daggett: Rennie had
a special connection to Jason

1098
00:51:58,929 --> 00:52:02,160
because I think her evil uncle

1099
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:05,134
was trying to teach her how
to swim when she was a little girl.

1100
00:52:05,169 --> 00:52:07,763
Peter Mark Richman:
I tossed her in the water,

1101
00:52:07,805 --> 00:52:11,104
which was a not-very-nice thing
to do for an uncle.

1102
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:14,508
And she had
an inordinate fear

1103
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:16,342
of drowning.

1104
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:20,111
And she saw Jason
under the water.

1105
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:21,640
(screaming)

1106
00:52:23,887 --> 00:52:26,685
I felt very empowered
playing the part, especially at the end

1107
00:52:26,723 --> 00:52:30,090
when I was the only one surviving
and there we were in the sewers.

1108
00:52:30,127 --> 00:52:32,618
And I felt like,

1109
00:52:32,663 --> 00:52:35,188
"All right,
this is a nice, tough,

1110
00:52:35,232 --> 00:52:38,167
accurate portrayal
of a girl's strength."

1111
00:52:38,202 --> 00:52:39,692
You didn't get me in the lake,

1112
00:52:39,736 --> 00:52:42,364
and you're not
gonna get me now!

1113
00:52:44,942 --> 00:52:47,843
I would probably go back
and do another "Friday the 13th."

1114
00:52:47,878 --> 00:52:51,370
If nothing else,
then just to make my boys happy.

1115
00:52:51,415 --> 00:52:53,280
Women in "Friday the 13th" movies

1116
00:52:53,317 --> 00:52:56,650
are always strong.
You know, they're strong characters.

1117
00:52:56,687 --> 00:52:58,314
And we wanted
to be true to that.

1118
00:52:58,355 --> 00:53:01,586
So Todd and I came up
with this idea of this robot

1119
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:04,856
and making the robot female.

1120
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:07,022
One of the most delightful things
about her

1121
00:53:07,064 --> 00:53:09,498
is like just unstoppable,
unflappable.

1122
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:12,627
I feel very privileged in that
I got to survive that movie.

1123
00:53:12,669 --> 00:53:15,695
Even though he knocked
my block off and I was a head...

1124
00:53:15,739 --> 00:53:17,138
I was a talking head

1125
00:53:17,174 --> 00:53:20,075
for, I think, the last third
of the movie...

1126
00:53:20,110 --> 00:53:23,045
I feel like one
of the lucky ones.

1127
00:53:24,114 --> 00:53:26,548
I think most of the people
that have survived

1128
00:53:26,583 --> 00:53:29,450
have been women
because all of us directors

1129
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:31,454
have a tremendous
amount of guilt

1130
00:53:31,488 --> 00:53:33,683
for what we've done
to all of these poor girls

1131
00:53:33,724 --> 00:53:35,385
in the movies.

1132
00:53:35,425 --> 00:53:38,622
I do think that the heroines
have a strength that's there,

1133
00:53:38,662 --> 00:53:40,926
but a real vulnerability

1134
00:53:40,964 --> 00:53:42,932
that attracts people.

1135
00:53:42,966 --> 00:53:46,458
People wanna love you
and they wanna cheer for you.

1136
00:53:46,503 --> 00:53:48,368
Steel:
If they were to ask me

1137
00:53:48,405 --> 00:53:52,171
to do sort of
the "Friday the 13th" survivors...

1138
00:53:52,209 --> 00:53:55,701
gonna take on Jason...
would I do it?

1139
00:53:55,746 --> 00:53:57,077
Hell yeah!

1140
00:53:57,114 --> 00:53:58,706
Wouldn't it be great

1141
00:53:58,749 --> 00:54:02,412
if the strong women
of the series came back

1142
00:54:02,452 --> 00:54:04,613
and took him on?

1143
00:54:04,655 --> 00:54:08,489
It would be great... so maybe
Adrienne and Lar and myself.

1144
00:54:08,525 --> 00:54:11,085
I think that it would be very
interesting if you had a triad

1145
00:54:11,128 --> 00:54:14,256
of the girls,
where you would have the powers,

1146
00:54:14,298 --> 00:54:17,563
an extremely strong one
and just a ballsy character.

1147
00:54:17,601 --> 00:54:21,128
It would be a dream movie for the fans.
And I think we could still pull it off.

1148
00:54:21,171 --> 00:54:22,968
We still have a couple
of good years in us.

1149
00:54:23,006 --> 00:54:26,635
Jason? Where's Jason?!

1150
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:28,941
We took care of him.

1151
00:54:28,979 --> 00:54:32,278
(siren wails)

1152
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:34,178
(whimpers)

1153
00:54:34,251 --> 00:54:36,776
Please please
please, help me.

1154
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:40,848
(girl screaming)

1155
00:54:49,499 --> 00:54:53,128
Yeah, bad luck
sure can be bloody.

1156
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:56,662
It's not just the victims
on the screen that run into problems.

1157
00:54:56,707 --> 00:55:00,199
Over the past 30 years
there have been troublesome times

1158
00:55:00,243 --> 00:55:03,576
for the "Friday the 13th"
filmmakers as well.

1159
00:55:03,614 --> 00:55:05,912
Many had nothing
whatsoever to do

1160
00:55:05,949 --> 00:55:08,713
with our hockey-masked friend.

1161
00:55:08,752 --> 00:55:12,153
Paul?
(screaming)

1162
00:55:14,591 --> 00:55:18,118
Shooting my death scene
was a bit of a challenge.

1163
00:55:18,161 --> 00:55:20,595
That's where
the horror part came

1164
00:55:20,631 --> 00:55:23,498
into the filming with me.

1165
00:55:23,533 --> 00:55:27,162
From here down,
I was in the water.

1166
00:55:27,204 --> 00:55:29,035
There were points
where I just felt

1167
00:55:29,072 --> 00:55:31,302
like I couldn't go on anymore.

1168
00:55:31,341 --> 00:55:35,300
It was either 22 or 23.
It was very very cold

1169
00:55:35,345 --> 00:55:38,143
and she had a bikini on
and she was freezing.

1170
00:55:38,181 --> 00:55:40,308
She was so cold
her teeth were chattering,

1171
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:42,079
and this girl
was actually turning blue.

1172
00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:44,417
Aronson:
Ted White stood up for me

1173
00:55:44,454 --> 00:55:46,615
and demanded that we

1174
00:55:46,657 --> 00:55:49,091
get the shot now or else.

1175
00:55:49,126 --> 00:55:52,926
And it turns out that I had
gotten hypothermia,

1176
00:55:52,963 --> 00:55:54,430
and I was quite sick

1177
00:55:54,464 --> 00:55:57,592
for several days after that.

1178
00:55:57,634 --> 00:56:01,536
LeMay: A whole day spent
filming the end of the movie

1179
00:56:01,571 --> 00:56:03,505
where Jason's getting
sucked into the earth

1180
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,303
and trying to drag me down
with him.

1181
00:56:05,342 --> 00:56:09,039
On the soundstage, they'd pretty
much created this large sandbox

1182
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:11,274
with a hole in it,
which Jason would pop up,

1183
00:56:11,314 --> 00:56:14,181
grab me by the leg
and keep pulling me down.

1184
00:56:14,217 --> 00:56:18,085
And for some reason
that sequence took a half a day

1185
00:56:18,121 --> 00:56:20,248
with me screaming
at the top of my lungs

1186
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:21,689
and just wearing my body out.

1187
00:56:21,725 --> 00:56:24,694
I thought every shot was gonna
be the last dang one, you know?

1188
00:56:24,728 --> 00:56:26,889
I thought it was it.
"We got this one, baby."

1189
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:30,627
I don't think I've ever
been so exhausted in my life.

1190
00:56:30,667 --> 00:56:33,727
Man: Now, dirt demons,
everything up, moving.

1191
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:36,068
Al Magliochetti:
The visual-effects climax,

1192
00:56:36,106 --> 00:56:39,200
all these demons came up
from below the ground

1193
00:56:39,242 --> 00:56:43,110
and started grabbing Jason
and trying to pull him down into hell.

1194
00:56:43,146 --> 00:56:46,274
And KNB had a very elaborate
sequence designed for that,

1195
00:56:46,316 --> 00:56:49,410
with all kinds of puppets.
And we had a very elaborate miniature...

1196
00:56:49,453 --> 00:56:52,388
which wound up not being used
because of technical problems...

1197
00:56:52,422 --> 00:56:54,390
that actually grabbed Jason

1198
00:56:54,424 --> 00:56:57,086
and started dragging him under.

1199
00:56:57,127 --> 00:56:59,789
Isn't that cool?
How many people get this going on?

1200
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:02,424
On the final day of production

1201
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:05,526
I got my action figure...

1202
00:57:05,569 --> 00:57:08,163
made by the hair
and makeup guys.

1203
00:57:08,205 --> 00:57:10,503
So this is my one-of-a-kind
action figure.

1204
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,770
We shot the ending twice.

1205
00:57:12,809 --> 00:57:15,243
We actually did
another ending,

1206
00:57:15,278 --> 00:57:18,304
which most people
have never seen,

1207
00:57:18,348 --> 00:57:20,578
in which Dana Kimmell
comes up to the door

1208
00:57:20,617 --> 00:57:22,278
of the house in a dream,

1209
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,287
and Jason comes
through the front door

1210
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:25,811
and decapitates her.

1211
00:57:25,856 --> 00:57:28,484
This is the actual mask that
was done on my skin.

1212
00:57:28,525 --> 00:57:31,289
It's a little...

1213
00:57:31,328 --> 00:57:34,092
oh, here's a worm.

1214
00:57:34,131 --> 00:57:36,725
It's a little crumbly,
but it's split up the back

1215
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,395
because as it was on my face
all the way around my neck...

1216
00:57:39,436 --> 00:57:40,835
I had a bald cap on...

1217
00:57:40,871 --> 00:57:43,772
they did the whole thing
right on my head.

1218
00:57:43,807 --> 00:57:46,742
And so to get me out of it,
they split it right up the back.

1219
00:57:46,777 --> 00:57:49,974
So it used to be something
like this, but...

1220
00:57:52,983 --> 00:57:56,384
Monoson:
My parents are away in the movie...

1221
00:57:56,419 --> 00:57:58,319
I had to be stoned.

1222
00:57:58,355 --> 00:58:00,983
And so I thought,
"Hmm, wouldn't that be interesting

1223
00:58:01,024 --> 00:58:03,219
to actually be stoned
on camera?"

1224
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:06,559
So I go to my trailer
and I get stoned.

1225
00:58:06,596 --> 00:58:08,928
I'm a very paranoid
stoned person.

1226
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:12,833
So it was the worst worst idea
I could have ever done.

1227
00:58:12,869 --> 00:58:14,837
And they knocked on my door
to go to the set.

1228
00:58:14,871 --> 00:58:17,499
I'm like, "What?!"
And they're like, "We're ready for you,"

1229
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:20,032
and I'm like, "Okay."
(laughs)

1230
00:58:20,076 --> 00:58:22,044
So they take me
and I'm on the set,

1231
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:25,070
and, actors,
don't get stoned and act.

1232
00:58:25,115 --> 00:58:27,640
It's absolutely the worst thing.

1233
00:58:27,684 --> 00:58:29,413
I was out of my mind.

1234
00:58:29,452 --> 00:58:31,545
Richman:
I do remember a scene

1235
00:58:31,588 --> 00:58:35,149
in my bedroom
where this girl comes on to me,

1236
00:58:35,192 --> 00:58:37,752
and I was getting
very keyed up,

1237
00:58:37,794 --> 00:58:39,227
turned on.

1238
00:58:39,262 --> 00:58:41,890
In the editing
they didn't show any of that.

1239
00:58:41,932 --> 00:58:43,490
And I was pissed off.

1240
00:58:43,533 --> 00:58:45,660
I was really...

1241
00:58:45,702 --> 00:58:47,761
having it affect me.

1242
00:58:47,804 --> 00:58:51,331
The MPAA really went after
the "Friday the 13th" films,

1243
00:58:51,374 --> 00:58:53,808
'cause they were asleep
when the first film was rated.

1244
00:58:53,844 --> 00:58:56,608
They kind of let it pass.
When the sequels came out,

1245
00:58:56,646 --> 00:59:00,241
and after all the criticism,
they had to be more stringent.

1246
00:59:00,283 --> 00:59:04,083
Probably the most heavily edited
was "Part VII."

1247
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,521
The MPAA was just vicious
toward that film for some reason.

1248
00:59:07,557 --> 00:59:10,390
Ratings board raped my movie.

1249
00:59:10,427 --> 00:59:12,895
I equate horror

1250
00:59:12,929 --> 00:59:14,590
to telling a joke.

1251
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:16,792
Everything's in the setup
and then the payoff

1252
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:19,028
has gotta be,
"Whoa, that's great!"

1253
00:59:19,069 --> 00:59:21,469
We were telling the joke
and we weren't allowed

1254
00:59:21,504 --> 00:59:23,369
to give them the punchline.

1255
00:59:23,406 --> 00:59:25,465
So what you see

1256
00:59:25,508 --> 00:59:27,476
in the final cut of "Friday VII,"

1257
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:30,946
which is not really my cut,
is a very watered-down version

1258
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:33,040
of what we hoped it would be.

1259
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:35,574
Rotten:
The MPAA was just responding

1260
00:59:35,619 --> 00:59:39,146
to a lot of parent advocate groups
that were coming out of the woodwork.

1261
00:59:39,189 --> 00:59:42,556
I mean, you had parents picketing
out in front of theaters

1262
00:59:42,592 --> 00:59:44,492
for certain films sometimes.

1263
00:59:44,527 --> 00:59:48,122
I think the MPAA gets crazy
when you combine sex and violence

1264
00:59:48,164 --> 00:59:51,099
at the same time, so I think that's
something you have to be careful about.

1265
00:59:51,134 --> 00:59:53,728
All the sequels
really went through the wringer

1266
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:55,965
to secure R ratings.

1267
00:59:56,006 --> 00:59:58,770
Steinmann:
The MPAA,

1268
00:59:58,808 --> 01:00:02,437
after a lot heavy-duty fights,

1269
01:00:04,547 --> 01:00:08,142
insisted that we omit
47 seconds.

1270
01:00:08,184 --> 01:00:10,015
Almost every kill

1271
01:00:10,053 --> 01:00:13,022
was either off-screen

1272
01:00:13,056 --> 01:00:14,148
or minimized.

1273
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:16,818
Ross: Tiffany Helm, there was a scene
that nobody knows about,

1274
01:00:16,860 --> 01:00:19,590
where she had her death scene.
I think they had to change it

1275
01:00:19,629 --> 01:00:22,223
because it would have
been rated X if they kept it.

1276
01:00:23,667 --> 01:00:26,261
Jason was gonna
go in for the kill.

1277
01:00:26,303 --> 01:00:28,635
Tiffany was gonna have
her legs up like this,

1278
01:00:28,672 --> 01:00:31,937
and he was just gonna go like...
couldn't show that.

1279
01:00:31,975 --> 01:00:35,536
Couldn't show that back then.
That was cut. Rated X.

1280
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:37,569
X. Shoot it.

1281
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:43,579
King: "Friday the 13th" was
the greatest experience for me,

1282
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,713
and then slowly I realized

1283
01:00:45,755 --> 01:00:47,620
I had a stalker.

1284
01:00:47,657 --> 01:00:51,058
I had an ordeal with him
up close at one point,

1285
01:00:51,094 --> 01:00:53,654
which in itself
is a horror movie.

1286
01:00:55,065 --> 01:00:57,863
It's all okay now.
It's all good now.

1287
01:00:59,235 --> 01:01:01,760
And having
the three generations

1288
01:01:01,805 --> 01:01:05,263
of fans from
around the world that fly in

1289
01:01:05,308 --> 01:01:08,573
to wherever I am
at a city or a convention

1290
01:01:08,611 --> 01:01:11,341
that really talk to me
and care and tell me how much

1291
01:01:11,381 --> 01:01:13,474
it affected them
when they found out...

1292
01:01:13,516 --> 01:01:15,279
it's just a gift.

1293
01:01:15,318 --> 01:01:19,721
It's a beautiful thing and I don't
care how sappy it sounds.

1294
01:01:19,756 --> 01:01:22,725
I thank them.

1295
01:01:23,927 --> 01:01:26,418
Steel:
One of the scary moments on the set

1296
01:01:26,463 --> 01:01:28,693
was in Jason's lair

1297
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:31,530
when I put the sweater on

1298
01:01:31,568 --> 01:01:33,160
and I talked to him
about Mother.

1299
01:01:33,203 --> 01:01:35,296
And he's supposed

1300
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:37,670
to bring up this pickaxe.

1301
01:01:37,707 --> 01:01:39,766
So I got really anxious

1302
01:01:39,809 --> 01:01:42,437
and I brought the machete down.

1303
01:01:42,479 --> 01:01:44,777
She missed the pickaxe,

1304
01:01:44,814 --> 01:01:47,248
and she came down
on my finger.

1305
01:01:47,283 --> 01:01:49,751
Steel:
And he goes to the hospital...

1306
01:01:49,786 --> 01:01:52,550
I think he had the machete
through his chest or something

1307
01:01:52,589 --> 01:01:54,682
and walks into
the emergency room

1308
01:01:54,724 --> 01:01:56,783
and they're like, "Oh my God!"

1309
01:01:56,826 --> 01:01:59,386
Then he said, " No no,
it's just right here on my finger."

1310
01:01:59,429 --> 01:02:02,455
And I have 13 stitches
in this finger.

1311
01:02:02,499 --> 01:02:05,093
It's right here.
This right here, it's 13 stitches.

1312
01:02:05,135 --> 01:02:07,467
And then he came back

1313
01:02:07,504 --> 01:02:09,665
and we started all over again.

1314
01:02:09,706 --> 01:02:13,665
We stayed at the camp. At one
of our first nights in the cabins...

1315
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:16,110
I think it was John Furey
and Bill Randolph

1316
01:02:16,146 --> 01:02:17,943
and Russell Todd...

1317
01:02:17,981 --> 01:02:20,108
knew where I was staying.

1318
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:22,175
And they went
to the screen windows

1319
01:02:22,218 --> 01:02:23,810
when it was really dark out

1320
01:02:23,853 --> 01:02:27,550
and they started scratching
on the screen windows.

1321
01:02:27,590 --> 01:02:30,787
I fainted.
I actually fainted

1322
01:02:30,827 --> 01:02:32,692
flat on the floor

1323
01:02:32,729 --> 01:02:35,562
'cause I just went... (gasps)
Boom!

1324
01:02:38,601 --> 01:02:41,229
(rock music playing)

1325
01:02:42,305 --> 01:02:44,170
Though the counselors
at Crystal Lake

1326
01:02:44,207 --> 01:02:47,404
worked very hard to keep
the rules of the camp clear,

1327
01:02:47,444 --> 01:02:50,470
the same can't be said
for the "Friday the 13th" films,

1328
01:02:50,513 --> 01:02:53,812
which have had more
than their share of ambiguities

1329
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:55,579
and inconsistencies,

1330
01:02:55,618 --> 01:02:57,643
leaving the fans longing
for more.

1331
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:02,121
Oh, no way, Becca.

1332
01:03:02,158 --> 01:03:05,559
- You so owe me a Wonderbra.
- (giggles)

1333
01:03:05,595 --> 01:03:07,654
Well, okay.

1334
01:03:07,697 --> 01:03:10,257
Strip Monopoly's
so much fun.

1335
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,927
Oooh!

1336
01:03:15,038 --> 01:03:16,903
Camp Crystal Lake rocks.

1337
01:03:17,974 --> 01:03:19,908
One of the things
that the "Friday" series

1338
01:03:19,943 --> 01:03:21,968
never really took pride in
was continuity.

1339
01:03:22,011 --> 01:03:25,037
How could it be Friday the 13th
if "2," "III" and "4"

1340
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:26,844
are within three or four days?

1341
01:03:26,883 --> 01:03:28,851
I don't think Monday the 16th

1342
01:03:28,885 --> 01:03:30,853
has quite the same ring to it.

1343
01:03:30,887 --> 01:03:32,855
Cohen:
People send me Jason timelines

1344
01:03:32,889 --> 01:03:35,983
and show me categorically
where I'm wrong about certain things,

1345
01:03:36,025 --> 01:03:38,619
and where the writer of "VI" was wrong,
or the writer of "III" was wrong.

1346
01:03:38,661 --> 01:03:42,062
And you know what, so what?
I just don't know.

1347
01:03:42,098 --> 01:03:44,658
King:
The fans have told me

1348
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:47,192
at convention after convention

1349
01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:49,831
that they felt "ripped off"

1350
01:03:49,873 --> 01:03:52,364
about the way Alice died
in "Part 2."

1351
01:03:52,408 --> 01:03:55,809
She didn't even see him.
It's like it could have been anyone.

1352
01:03:55,845 --> 01:03:57,870
As far as I'm concerned,
it was somebody else.

1353
01:03:57,914 --> 01:04:01,179
If Jason is who I believe he is

1354
01:04:01,217 --> 01:04:03,412
and who I think the fans
think he is,

1355
01:04:03,453 --> 01:04:06,388
it's not like he can look
her number up in the phonebook.

1356
01:04:06,422 --> 01:04:09,050
It's not like she would be listed
in the phonebook.

1357
01:04:09,092 --> 01:04:10,855
She got away.
But in the second one

1358
01:04:10,894 --> 01:04:12,885
he comes to her apartment
and kills her?

1359
01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:15,727
Now what I want to know is
how did Jason get a plane ticket?

1360
01:04:15,765 --> 01:04:18,563
There was a "Friday the 13th"
TV series.

1361
01:04:18,601 --> 01:04:21,069
LeMay:
The only thing that the series

1362
01:04:21,104 --> 01:04:22,833
and the movies

1363
01:04:22,872 --> 01:04:24,339
had in common
was the title.

1364
01:04:24,374 --> 01:04:27,207
It turns out it was about
people trying

1365
01:04:27,243 --> 01:04:29,837
to retrieve cursed artifacts

1366
01:04:29,879 --> 01:04:31,437
from a pawnshop.

1367
01:04:31,481 --> 01:04:34,348
I think a lot of people who were
really big fans of the series

1368
01:04:34,384 --> 01:04:36,511
didn't like the fact
that they stole the name

1369
01:04:36,553 --> 01:04:39,852
and tried to sneak a fast one
past everybody.

1370
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:42,687
So beginning with "Part III,"

1371
01:04:42,725 --> 01:04:45,193
when Jason finds the mask

1372
01:04:45,228 --> 01:04:47,628
that everyone identifies
with him,

1373
01:04:47,664 --> 01:04:49,962
there's been some debate
over the years about

1374
01:04:49,999 --> 01:04:51,591
how that happened.

1375
01:04:51,634 --> 01:04:54,364
And the one thing that
everybody likes to take credit for

1376
01:04:54,404 --> 01:04:57,567
is who put the hockey mask
on Jason.

1377
01:04:57,607 --> 01:05:00,269
One day we were doing
makeup tests

1378
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:02,870
on "Friday the 13th Part III."

1379
01:05:02,912 --> 01:05:04,709
So just for the 3D concept,

1380
01:05:04,747 --> 01:05:07,648
I must admit, in modesty,

1381
01:05:07,684 --> 01:05:09,879
that I put the hockey mask
on Jason.

1382
01:05:09,919 --> 01:05:11,477
I don't care
what anybody says.

1383
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:14,217
They weren't gonna use that bag again
based on what happened

1384
01:05:14,257 --> 01:05:16,885
to me with the burns.
They had to come up with another idea.

1385
01:05:16,926 --> 01:05:19,156
That's why they came up
with the hockey mask.

1386
01:05:19,195 --> 01:05:22,096
I believe it was Peter Schindler

1387
01:05:22,131 --> 01:05:26,033
and Marty Becker were
Detroit hockey fans.

1388
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:28,970
And it was their idea
to come up with a hockey mask

1389
01:05:29,005 --> 01:05:30,939
to cover the face up.

1390
01:05:30,974 --> 01:05:33,033
Every time
kids come to my door

1391
01:05:33,076 --> 01:05:34,941
wearing
the Jason hockey mask,

1392
01:05:34,978 --> 01:05:38,436
I figure, " Wow, this is
another 50 I didn't get."

1393
01:05:38,481 --> 01:05:41,609
They're all still bickering
about it, but you heard it here...

1394
01:05:41,651 --> 01:05:43,346
mine.

1395
01:05:43,386 --> 01:05:46,287
Katz: The end of
"Friday the 13th Part 2" is still

1396
01:05:46,322 --> 01:05:49,155
one of the most confusing endings
of that series.

1397
01:05:49,192 --> 01:05:51,592
Probably easily the most,
other than the toxic-waste

1398
01:05:51,628 --> 01:05:53,493
version of teenaged Jason.

1399
01:05:53,529 --> 01:05:56,157
Paul! Where's Paul?

1400
01:05:56,199 --> 01:05:59,794
For me, it wasn't a dream.

1401
01:05:59,836 --> 01:06:01,997
Maybe that's one
of the good parts of the movie

1402
01:06:02,038 --> 01:06:04,268
is that you get to decide that
for yourself.

1403
01:06:04,307 --> 01:06:07,367
On "Freddy vs. Jason,"
they went a different direction

1404
01:06:07,410 --> 01:06:11,176
with casting Jason

1405
01:06:11,214 --> 01:06:13,546
and didn't cast Kane Hodder.

1406
01:06:13,583 --> 01:06:16,711
And I was really surprised.

1407
01:06:16,753 --> 01:06:20,553
I really wanted to use Kane
and then Ronnie Yu decided

1408
01:06:20,590 --> 01:06:23,218
that he really kind of
liked this other guy.

1409
01:06:23,259 --> 01:06:26,285
And he was directing
the movie and I said, "Fine."

1410
01:06:26,329 --> 01:06:29,924
It was a shame at some level
that Kane didn't get to do it.

1411
01:06:29,966 --> 01:06:32,958
About our clothes, I mean...

1412
01:06:33,002 --> 01:06:35,596
that's slightly the weirdest thing
about our roles,

1413
01:06:35,638 --> 01:06:37,731
which were supposed
to be these sexy girls

1414
01:06:37,774 --> 01:06:39,867
and we're dressed
in these ghastly clothes.

1415
01:06:39,909 --> 01:06:41,809
Camilla More:
What about our hair as well?

1416
01:06:41,844 --> 01:06:44,210
Our hair put up in sort
of little librarian buns.

1417
01:06:44,247 --> 01:06:45,578
I mean, hello.

1418
01:06:45,615 --> 01:06:49,016
And the pink puffy shirts
with the shoulder pads.

1419
01:06:49,052 --> 01:06:52,215
Lynch: It's kind of like
Springfield for " The Simpsons."

1420
01:06:52,255 --> 01:06:55,349
It's like, where is Crystal Lake?
It would be nice to find out someday

1421
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:58,360
where is this Crystal Lake,
'cause I'd like to go there and swim.

1422
01:06:58,394 --> 01:07:02,194
I can definitively answer
the question of where is Crystal Lake.

1423
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:05,962
Crystal Lake is in
Green Valley, New Jersey.

1424
01:07:06,002 --> 01:07:08,527
And the reason we know that
is because in "Part III,"

1425
01:07:08,571 --> 01:07:11,131
Shelly and Vera go
to a country store

1426
01:07:11,174 --> 01:07:13,335
and in the store,
you can see in the back,

1427
01:07:13,376 --> 01:07:17,039
it says " Welcome to Green Valley,
New Jersey." Case closed.

1428
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:20,015
Katz: "Jason Takes Manhattan"...
outside of having one of the great

1429
01:07:20,049 --> 01:07:23,041
teaser posters of all time,
which of course was then discontinued,

1430
01:07:23,086 --> 01:07:25,077
ultimately, the "I Heart New York,"

1431
01:07:25,121 --> 01:07:27,214
that's actually something
that's trademarked

1432
01:07:27,256 --> 01:07:30,350
by probably, I'm guessing,
the tourism bureau, if memory serves,

1433
01:07:30,393 --> 01:07:33,885
and that's actually a very valuable
license to them, ultimately.

1434
01:07:35,665 --> 01:07:38,634
Crystal Lake has changed sizes.
Somehow the boat gets

1435
01:07:38,668 --> 01:07:41,831
from this tiny little lake
to the Atlantic Ocean

1436
01:07:41,871 --> 01:07:43,429
to New York.

1437
01:07:43,473 --> 01:07:45,771
The cruise ship wasn't really
in the lake.

1438
01:07:45,808 --> 01:07:48,868
The cruise ship was on the ocean.
In my mind, I had it justified,

1439
01:07:48,911 --> 01:07:51,471
because I've seen places where
you can go from a lake to the ocean.

1440
01:07:51,514 --> 01:07:53,675
And we ultimately just said,
"No, let's forget it.

1441
01:07:53,716 --> 01:07:56,116
People may get mad at us for that,
but let's go for it."

1442
01:07:56,152 --> 01:07:57,949
Body switching
in "Jason Goes to Hell,"

1443
01:07:57,987 --> 01:08:00,182
I think that was a terrible
terrible decision.

1444
01:08:00,223 --> 01:08:03,215
Roday:
The fact that Jason turned into a slug

1445
01:08:03,259 --> 01:08:07,218
in "Part 9"...unacceptable.

1446
01:08:07,263 --> 01:08:09,163
Gordon.

1447
01:08:12,068 --> 01:08:14,002
The most rational character
in the entire

1448
01:08:14,070 --> 01:08:16,300
"Friday the 13th" series
is the dog in "Part 4."

1449
01:08:16,339 --> 01:08:19,365
You don't know whether Jason grabbed
the dog and threw him out the window.

1450
01:08:19,409 --> 01:08:21,775
The dog sees Jason
and the next shot is the dog

1451
01:08:21,811 --> 01:08:23,745
apparently jumping
through the window.

1452
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:26,578
There was a big fight over
whether we could kill the dog.

1453
01:08:26,616 --> 01:08:28,311
I think he jumped,
but I was hoping

1454
01:08:28,351 --> 01:08:30,114
some people will
think Jason did it.

1455
01:08:30,153 --> 01:08:33,452
Maybe Tina from "VII" telekinetically
yanked the dog out the window.

1456
01:08:41,464 --> 01:08:44,365
Well, he was bound
to catch up with her... sooner or later.

1457
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,300
If there's one thing
that we've learned

1458
01:08:46,335 --> 01:08:49,202
it's escaping Jason
is a rarity.

1459
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:51,638
Over the last three decades,
his reign of terror

1460
01:08:51,674 --> 01:08:54,404
has gone beyond
the silver screen.

1461
01:08:54,444 --> 01:08:56,241
In fact, it's clear that Jason

1462
01:08:56,279 --> 01:08:58,577
has done more
than take Manhattan.

1463
01:08:58,614 --> 01:09:00,673
In fact, I'd say
he's conquered the world.

1464
01:09:04,887 --> 01:09:06,149
(gears grind)

1465
01:09:06,189 --> 01:09:09,283
Oh! That had to hurt.

1466
01:09:09,325 --> 01:09:10,883
Interestingly enough,

1467
01:09:10,927 --> 01:09:14,886
Jason did manage
to infiltrate the pop culture

1468
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:18,059
in a big big way.
And I think that all started

1469
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:21,433
with "Part III" in 3D.

1470
01:09:21,471 --> 01:09:24,463
I have the home-theater glass set,

1471
01:09:24,507 --> 01:09:27,533
so you can see it and watch it
and people would walk into my house

1472
01:09:27,577 --> 01:09:29,602
and I have them on,
and be like, " Hey, what's up?

1473
01:09:29,645 --> 01:09:31,169
I'm watching
'Friday the 13th Part III." '

1474
01:09:31,214 --> 01:09:34,479
Graham: From a merchandising
perspective, it's huge.

1475
01:09:34,517 --> 01:09:36,712
I cannot believe
the branding of Jason.

1476
01:09:36,752 --> 01:09:39,118
He is no less marketable
than Ronald McDonald

1477
01:09:39,155 --> 01:09:40,918
or Mickey Mouse at this point.

1478
01:09:40,957 --> 01:09:43,016
Jason is making money.

1479
01:09:43,059 --> 01:09:46,119
I mean, does he get
a percentage of the sales?

1480
01:09:46,162 --> 01:09:47,720
I'm very curious.

1481
01:09:47,763 --> 01:09:50,231
Jason Voorhees has been
mass marketed over the years,

1482
01:09:50,266 --> 01:09:52,860
starting with this Nintendo game
back in the early '80s.

1483
01:09:52,902 --> 01:09:54,529
Adam Green:
That was the worst game ever.

1484
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:57,300
All you did is run around the cabins. And
there'd be like nothing, nothing,

1485
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:58,568
Jason's in here! I'm dead.

1486
01:09:58,608 --> 01:10:01,839
My name's James Rolfe.
I have an internet show...

1487
01:10:01,878 --> 01:10:03,345
"The Angry Video Game Nerd."

1488
01:10:03,379 --> 01:10:05,813
The "Friday the 13th" episode
made its debut

1489
01:10:05,848 --> 01:10:09,614
on Friday the 13th,
October 2006.

1490
01:10:09,652 --> 01:10:12,212
Uh-oh, he's coming. Whoa!

1491
01:10:12,255 --> 01:10:14,985
Well, he scared the shit out
of me and now he's fighting me

1492
01:10:15,024 --> 01:10:17,117
like in " Mike Tyson's
Punch-Out!!"

1493
01:10:17,159 --> 01:10:18,990
They've created a hero image

1494
01:10:19,028 --> 01:10:22,623
of an individual that's unstoppable.

1495
01:10:22,665 --> 01:10:24,189
He's this super slasher hero.

1496
01:10:24,233 --> 01:10:26,030
There's no rhyme or reason,
you know?

1497
01:10:26,068 --> 01:10:28,628
He's been on lunchboxes
and thermoses,

1498
01:10:28,671 --> 01:10:30,536
and I think he was
in a Nike commercial.

1499
01:10:30,573 --> 01:10:32,404
- (screams)
- (pants)

1500
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:35,035
Those I believe were banned
or pulled from the market.

1501
01:10:35,077 --> 01:10:37,773
There's been countless TV shows
that have parodied "Friday the 13th,"

1502
01:10:37,813 --> 01:10:41,271
- from "MADtv."
- Man: Jason Takes NASA.

1503
01:10:41,317 --> 01:10:43,751
Yeah, we've done a bunch
of "Friday the 13th" parodies.

1504
01:10:43,786 --> 01:10:47,415
The first thing we did was
a"Horror Movie Big Brother."

1505
01:10:47,456 --> 01:10:49,219
(chainsaw whirring)

1506
01:10:49,258 --> 01:10:51,385
We did a Scooby gang
investigates the mystery

1507
01:10:51,427 --> 01:10:53,292
- of Camp Crystal Lake.
- Zoinks!

1508
01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:55,263
When it gets referenced
on "The Simpsons"

1509
01:10:55,298 --> 01:10:57,596
or "South Park," that's like
your proudest moment.

1510
01:10:57,633 --> 01:10:58,827
(screams)
Run!

1511
01:10:58,868 --> 01:11:02,269
I love the fact that "The Simpsons"
have Jason and Freddy.

1512
01:11:02,305 --> 01:11:04,967
- They should be here by now.
- Ah, what are you gonna do?

1513
01:11:05,007 --> 01:11:07,601
- (switches channel)
- When he got that MTV Movie Award,

1514
01:11:07,643 --> 01:11:10,635
it was absolutely invigorating
for all the fans

1515
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:14,309
and also it was like, " Where have
we landed exactly as a society?"

1516
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:16,614
We're giving a Lifetime
Achievement Award

1517
01:11:16,652 --> 01:11:19,348
to a masked predator.

1518
01:11:19,388 --> 01:11:21,356
Shortly after we did
"Jason Takes Manhattan,"

1519
01:11:21,390 --> 01:11:24,450
I was asked to do
"The Arsenio Hall Show"

1520
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:26,085
in costume as a guest.

1521
01:11:26,128 --> 01:11:29,029
He pulled the whole interview off
by talking to someone who doesn't speak.

1522
01:11:29,065 --> 01:11:31,124
How are you?

1523
01:11:35,271 --> 01:11:37,739
- That's good.
- One of the rare things I've ever done

1524
01:11:37,773 --> 01:11:40,037
in full costume
besides the movie.

1525
01:11:40,076 --> 01:11:41,668
Miska:
Snow globes,

1526
01:11:41,711 --> 01:11:43,542
there's dolls,

1527
01:11:43,579 --> 01:11:47,538
there's even a haunted house
at Universal Studios in Florida

1528
01:11:47,583 --> 01:11:49,107
and in Hollywood.

1529
01:11:49,151 --> 01:11:53,110
One of the greatest thrills
that I've had as a Jason fan

1530
01:11:53,155 --> 01:11:56,454
was going to the Universal
Horror Nights last year.

1531
01:11:56,492 --> 01:11:59,689
Jason Voorhees is running after you.
It's a real guy

1532
01:11:59,729 --> 01:12:03,426
in the whole costume.
I kind of pooped my pants a little bit.

1533
01:12:03,466 --> 01:12:06,162
Hi, I'm John Murdy,
creative director of Universal Studios'

1534
01:12:06,202 --> 01:12:08,693
Hollywood's Halloween Horror Nights
and right now we are standing

1535
01:12:08,738 --> 01:12:12,674
in front of the Crystal Lake cabin
from "Friday the 13th: Camp Blood."

1536
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:15,472
When you're designing
a haunted attraction like this,

1537
01:12:15,511 --> 01:12:17,376
there's basically three things
you look for.

1538
01:12:17,413 --> 01:12:19,813
One is that the property has legs.

1539
01:12:19,849 --> 01:12:21,976
Second is that
the characters are something

1540
01:12:22,018 --> 01:12:25,385
that you can achieve with actors,
and the third is that the environments

1541
01:12:25,421 --> 01:12:28,754
are strong and easily recognizable.
And "Friday the 13th" has all three.

1542
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:31,191
So we were very lucky
when we worked with New Line,

1543
01:12:31,227 --> 01:12:33,559
we were able to get
all three of those properties

1544
01:12:33,596 --> 01:12:36,690
and basically turn our theme park
into a living horror movie.

1545
01:12:36,732 --> 01:12:40,031
In this case, he's got
a poor victim stuck in this vise.

1546
01:12:40,069 --> 01:12:43,004
His head's in the vise. Jason
comes in and gives the vise a crank.

1547
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:45,599
We have a triggered audio effect
that sounds like his bones

1548
01:12:45,641 --> 01:12:47,108
in his skull are crushing,

1549
01:12:47,143 --> 01:12:50,738
and we tied this
into water spritz effect

1550
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:53,214
so that the guests think "eye goo"

1551
01:12:53,249 --> 01:12:56,082
is shooting out
of the victim onto them.

1552
01:12:56,118 --> 01:12:58,780
This is for the wheelchair victim
that has the machete in his head.

1553
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:01,187
Again, there's a secret door
for Jason back here

1554
01:13:01,223 --> 01:13:03,157
so he can make
a dramatic entrance,

1555
01:13:03,192 --> 01:13:06,252
and this poor guy
that you think is dead leaps to life.

1556
01:13:06,295 --> 01:13:09,321
When you're designing an attraction like
"Friday the 13th: Camp Blood,"

1557
01:13:09,365 --> 01:13:12,129
for us, what we really want
to do is we wanna deliver

1558
01:13:12,168 --> 01:13:14,329
to the fans
all their favorite kills

1559
01:13:14,370 --> 01:13:16,361
from the "Friday the 13th" series.

1560
01:13:16,405 --> 01:13:18,737
So this is a kill
from "Freddy vs. Jason."

1561
01:13:18,774 --> 01:13:20,935
This is the guy who gets
his back broken in half.

1562
01:13:20,976 --> 01:13:24,104
There's a performer that's laying here
with his head against the bed.

1563
01:13:24,146 --> 01:13:26,307
Jason comes storming
into the room.

1564
01:13:26,348 --> 01:13:29,408
He grabs hold of the bed, and he gives
it a good... (makes squashing sound)

1565
01:13:34,323 --> 01:13:36,757
With Jason,
they made countless toys.

1566
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:39,056
Every year
there's new editions coming out.

1567
01:13:39,095 --> 01:13:40,995
The McFarlane stuff
and the Mezco stuff,

1568
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:43,294
they all look great.
They're really well-sculpted,

1569
01:13:43,332 --> 01:13:46,130
articulated, awesome looking.
They're well-painted.

1570
01:13:46,168 --> 01:13:48,398
Who would have thought
there would be Jason dolls?

1571
01:13:50,272 --> 01:13:53,264
There was a great book
that came out a couple of years ago:

1572
01:13:53,309 --> 01:13:57,006
"Crystal Lake Memories"
about "Friday the 13th."

1573
01:13:57,046 --> 01:13:59,640
Peter Bracke did a great job.

1574
01:13:59,682 --> 01:14:02,242
He interviewed a lot of us
in the series,

1575
01:14:02,284 --> 01:14:06,050
from producers, directors
to actors, of course.

1576
01:14:06,088 --> 01:14:08,955
And it covers the series
from A to Z.

1577
01:14:08,991 --> 01:14:12,290
It was so fun to have come
to the book signing

1578
01:14:12,328 --> 01:14:14,956
and to see all the people

1579
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:16,589
that are now a part of

1580
01:14:16,632 --> 01:14:18,293
this whole "Friday the 13th"
phenomenon.

1581
01:14:19,902 --> 01:14:21,529
It was a party for the launch

1582
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:24,596
of the "Crystal Lake Memories" book,

1583
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,608
and we signed all
of the books.

1584
01:14:26,642 --> 01:14:28,542
And then of course
Jason showed up

1585
01:14:28,577 --> 01:14:30,169
and cut the cake
with a machete,

1586
01:14:30,212 --> 01:14:32,339
and that was awfully fun.

1587
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:34,281
An iconic brand
has been built.

1588
01:14:34,316 --> 01:14:37,114
Everybody knows Jason.

1589
01:14:37,153 --> 01:14:38,882
Everybody, all ages.

1590
01:14:38,921 --> 01:14:40,616
It's all over the world.

1591
01:14:40,656 --> 01:14:43,557
At Halloween,
there's always gonna be some kid

1592
01:14:43,592 --> 01:14:45,890
down the hall
wearing a hockey mask.

1593
01:14:45,928 --> 01:14:47,953
There's at least one kid
who comes down your street

1594
01:14:47,997 --> 01:14:49,897
who is Jason Voorhees,

1595
01:14:49,932 --> 01:14:51,957
and the funny thing is
he's up there with Santa Claus

1596
01:14:52,001 --> 01:14:53,832
in the sense
that everybody knows who it is.

1597
01:14:53,869 --> 01:14:55,359
Jason is a big icon.

1598
01:14:55,404 --> 01:14:57,429
I had a trick-or-treater
come to my house...

1599
01:14:57,473 --> 01:14:59,134
a little kid dressed as Jason.

1600
01:14:59,175 --> 01:15:01,143
And I went,
"I worked with him."

1601
01:15:01,177 --> 01:15:04,078
And the kid kind of looked at me
like he didn't understand.

1602
01:15:04,113 --> 01:15:06,547
And I asked my nephew,
'cause he's 13,

1603
01:15:06,582 --> 01:15:08,948
I said, "What is that?"
He goes, "That's the Jason mask."

1604
01:15:08,984 --> 01:15:11,452
And I said, " You know
I'm in one of those movies?"

1605
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:14,888
And he said, " Oh, I've never
seen any of those movies,

1606
01:15:14,924 --> 01:15:16,721
but I know all about Jason."

1607
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:18,852
In hindsight, it seems silly
there wouldn't be a backlash.

1608
01:15:18,894 --> 01:15:20,361
The critics were outraged.

1609
01:15:20,396 --> 01:15:22,921
Gene Siskel launched a letter-writing
campaign to Paramount.

1610
01:15:22,965 --> 01:15:24,990
"Friday the 13th:
The Final Chapter,"

1611
01:15:25,034 --> 01:15:27,730
an immoral and reprehensible
piece of trash...

1612
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:30,671
When Roger Ebert said
that "Friday the 13th" was

1613
01:15:30,706 --> 01:15:33,573
"an immoral and reprehensible
piece of trash,"

1614
01:15:33,609 --> 01:15:37,101
I thought, " Two thumbs up.
Gotta see it." (laughs)

1615
01:15:37,146 --> 01:15:39,273
Kratka:
There's just so much in our culture

1616
01:15:39,315 --> 01:15:42,773
that gets labeled things
unnecessarily

1617
01:15:42,818 --> 01:15:44,285
or just unjustifiably.

1618
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,720
And I think "Friday the 13th" s
were just...

1619
01:15:46,755 --> 01:15:48,245
they're scary movies.

1620
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:51,123
As film critics,
shame on them for not appreciating

1621
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:54,857
the fact that they are
artistic entertainment vehicles

1622
01:15:54,897 --> 01:15:57,798
for a very defined demographic.

1623
01:15:57,833 --> 01:16:00,563
We have fun reading reviews.
We know what they're gonna be like,

1624
01:16:00,603 --> 01:16:04,369
and especially if someone gets
particularly bitchy and clever,

1625
01:16:04,406 --> 01:16:07,432
it's great. In a way it's sort of like
the "Friday the 13th" movie itself:

1626
01:16:07,476 --> 01:16:10,468
if they're clever in the way
they're trying to kill you, you cheer.

1627
01:16:10,512 --> 01:16:12,309
What's more appealing
than forbidden fruit?

1628
01:16:12,348 --> 01:16:14,509
That's the oldest story
that there is.

1629
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:16,780
So when you say
to a young 13-year-old,

1630
01:16:16,819 --> 01:16:20,778
"You can't go see that movie, young man.
It's a piece of immoral trash,"

1631
01:16:20,823 --> 01:16:24,452
I'm pretty confident that's the first
thing the 13-year-old's gonna go do.

1632
01:16:24,493 --> 01:16:28,452
As long as nobody's going out
and doing nothing crazy...

1633
01:16:28,497 --> 01:16:31,227
they never had to put
"Don't try this at home"

1634
01:16:31,267 --> 01:16:33,394
on the screen... so it's all fun.

1635
01:16:33,435 --> 01:16:35,903
It's not attracting psychos to it.

1636
01:16:35,938 --> 01:16:39,499
It really does attract

1637
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:43,272
a very respectful
group of people.

1638
01:16:43,312 --> 01:16:46,406
Jason can survive anything,
even bad reviews.

1639
01:16:46,448 --> 01:16:49,781
If you're taking these films
too seriously,

1640
01:16:49,818 --> 01:16:52,343
you should probably
go have a Valium

1641
01:16:52,388 --> 01:16:53,980
or do something else.

1642
01:16:54,023 --> 01:16:56,617
I started the Screamfest
Horror Film Festival in 2001

1643
01:16:56,659 --> 01:16:59,321
as a platform to give
independent filmmakers a way

1644
01:16:59,361 --> 01:17:03,161
to further their careers and have
their work be shown to the industry.

1645
01:17:03,198 --> 01:17:05,928
I think some of the films
that we've screened in Screamfest

1646
01:17:05,968 --> 01:17:08,198
definitely have been influenced
by "Friday the 13th."

1647
01:17:08,237 --> 01:17:11,673
Most recently I would say
Adam Green's "Hatchet."

1648
01:17:11,707 --> 01:17:14,039
I think almost any slasher movie

1649
01:17:14,076 --> 01:17:16,943
post-"Friday the 13th"

1650
01:17:16,979 --> 01:17:18,412
kind of tipped their hat to it.

1651
01:17:18,447 --> 01:17:21,678
It's a great independent film.
And it's great to look back

1652
01:17:21,717 --> 01:17:24,277
and... what?
20-some-odd years later

1653
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,187
to look back and see young filmmakers,
like an Adam, up and coming,

1654
01:17:27,222 --> 01:17:30,055
to have a film that's reminiscent
of "Friday the 13th."

1655
01:17:30,092 --> 01:17:31,650
So it's kind of cool.

1656
01:17:31,694 --> 01:17:33,719
I've been to a million conventions

1657
01:17:33,762 --> 01:17:36,230
and I see people
with Jason tattoos.

1658
01:17:37,599 --> 01:17:40,067
It's a lot of fun.

1659
01:17:44,707 --> 01:17:46,231
Come on, it's beautiful.

1660
01:17:46,275 --> 01:17:48,266
We bleed for this shit.

1661
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:51,871
The fans are open to creating
their own mythology

1662
01:17:51,914 --> 01:17:53,347
about them too.

1663
01:17:53,382 --> 01:17:56,476
Man: He had just received
a surprise postcard from Jason,

1664
01:17:56,518 --> 01:18:00,010
inviting him to take part
in a slayathon.

1665
01:18:00,055 --> 01:18:03,821
Jason doesn't have a star
on the walk of fame.

1666
01:18:03,859 --> 01:18:06,987
This is terrible.
He's been around for 30 years

1667
01:18:07,029 --> 01:18:09,156
and he can't get a star?

1668
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:11,257
Jason is a star!

1669
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:16,530
(silent)

1670
01:18:17,973 --> 01:18:19,941
Oh, sorry.
I didn't know anybody

1671
01:18:19,975 --> 01:18:23,172
was using this room.

1672
01:18:27,549 --> 01:18:29,881
(girl screaming)

1673
01:18:29,918 --> 01:18:32,716
Okay, I admit it.
I love this stuff.

1674
01:18:32,755 --> 01:18:35,417
But as we've seen,
so do millions of others.

1675
01:18:35,457 --> 01:18:38,790
I mean, after all a good killer
is never out of style, right?

1676
01:18:38,827 --> 01:18:41,523
Which is exactly why the original
terrifying legend

1677
01:18:41,563 --> 01:18:44,430
of Jason Voorhees
is being reimagined

1678
01:18:44,466 --> 01:18:47,867
and repackaged
for a whole new generation of fans.

1679
01:18:47,903 --> 01:18:50,963
It's exciting to see Jason up
to his old tricks.

1680
01:18:51,006 --> 01:18:53,201
(girl screaming)

1681
01:18:56,311 --> 01:18:58,438
So now after all of this time,

1682
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:01,244
playing around with Jason

1683
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:02,841
for all these years,

1684
01:19:02,885 --> 01:19:06,719
there comes a new look,
a new feel hopefully

1685
01:19:06,755 --> 01:19:08,985
in this new reimagining

1686
01:19:09,024 --> 01:19:11,117
or reboot of the franchise.

1687
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:14,152
I hope the fans will enjoy it
from the same point of view

1688
01:19:14,196 --> 01:19:16,061
I enjoyed it from, which is

1689
01:19:16,098 --> 01:19:19,033
to see Jason

1690
01:19:19,068 --> 01:19:20,729
for the first time again.

1691
01:19:20,769 --> 01:19:22,737
To be able to work
with Jason Voorhees

1692
01:19:22,771 --> 01:19:24,932
and to see that mask...
I can tell you the first day

1693
01:19:24,973 --> 01:19:27,271
that he wore that mask on set,
we all got chills.

1694
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:29,436
It was amazing,
and it was amazing to think

1695
01:19:29,478 --> 01:19:32,106
that here's this thing
that we've grown up with,

1696
01:19:32,147 --> 01:19:34,581
and it's right here
and we can touch it and feel it,

1697
01:19:34,616 --> 01:19:37,517
because when we watched it as kids,
it felt so far away.

1698
01:19:37,553 --> 01:19:40,579
It's made by people
who love the franchise,

1699
01:19:40,622 --> 01:19:43,352
but who are going at it
with many more resources

1700
01:19:43,392 --> 01:19:45,257
than we ever had
or ever dreamed of.

1701
01:19:45,294 --> 01:19:49,094
This remake centers
around this brother-sister story

1702
01:19:49,131 --> 01:19:52,498
between the Whitney character
and the Clay character,

1703
01:19:52,534 --> 01:19:56,766
which is played by Jared Padalecki.
It doesn't go so well.

1704
01:19:56,805 --> 01:20:00,366
There's enough characters in there
to actually bring some comedy into it,

1705
01:20:00,409 --> 01:20:03,606
so there's gonna be
obviously the crazy deaths.

1706
01:20:03,645 --> 01:20:05,670
They've already said
there's 13.

1707
01:20:05,714 --> 01:20:08,205
They've already said that,
so I'm not giving away anything,

1708
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,741
but along with the deaths, you might have
some other lighter moments,

1709
01:20:10,786 --> 01:20:12,344
and it's gonna be a good contrast.

1710
01:20:12,387 --> 01:20:14,355
What I think makes
this one unique

1711
01:20:14,389 --> 01:20:17,620
is Jason being
more humanistic

1712
01:20:17,659 --> 01:20:21,618
and not sort of that
supernatural zombie.

1713
01:20:21,663 --> 01:20:23,790
He's a person.
We are coming into a time now

1714
01:20:23,832 --> 01:20:25,663
where everyone
is becoming more emotional

1715
01:20:25,701 --> 01:20:28,261
and in touch with their feelings.
So we give Jason this backstory,

1716
01:20:28,303 --> 01:20:30,203
and I feel like people can relate
to him more,

1717
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:33,470
which almost makes the killings
and the deaths seem justified.

1718
01:20:33,509 --> 01:20:35,477
I think there's more heart involved.

1719
01:20:35,511 --> 01:20:38,480
That I think is exciting,
'cause it's a new face of Jason.

1720
01:20:38,514 --> 01:20:41,039
And you have to figure out
how to recreate

1721
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:44,917
and keep renewing
this franchise.

1722
01:20:44,953 --> 01:20:47,319
And they've taken
sort of the best elements

1723
01:20:47,356 --> 01:20:49,483
of the first four
and wrapped it into one.

1724
01:20:49,525 --> 01:20:52,289
What the fans can expect to see
from the new "Friday the 13th"

1725
01:20:52,327 --> 01:20:54,761
is the best aspects
of the films they loved in the past

1726
01:20:54,796 --> 01:20:56,354
taken out and mixed up

1727
01:20:56,398 --> 01:20:59,856
and put into a brand-new film
for everybody.

1728
01:20:59,902 --> 01:21:02,564
I think they're gonna see
the intensity.

1729
01:21:02,604 --> 01:21:05,095
They're gonna see
over-the-top brutal kills.

1730
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:08,974
We really strived to give audiences
kills that they hadn't seen before,

1731
01:21:09,011 --> 01:21:11,138
or, and maybe better,

1732
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:14,741
kills they had seen
but we added something else to the kill.

1733
01:21:14,783 --> 01:21:17,081
And something else
that was in the original

1734
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:19,713
that really hasn't been
in any horror movies lately,

1735
01:21:19,755 --> 01:21:21,586
our movie has a ton
of nudity in it.

1736
01:21:21,623 --> 01:21:24,615
They're gonna see
over-the-top

1737
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:26,127
unique sex scenes.

1738
01:21:26,161 --> 01:21:28,721
It's gonna be an entertaining

1739
01:21:28,764 --> 01:21:30,391
wild roller-coaster of a ride.

1740
01:21:30,432 --> 01:21:32,161
We've gone to great lengths

1741
01:21:32,201 --> 01:21:34,169
to make the movie
feel very authentic,

1742
01:21:34,203 --> 01:21:36,637
to be very respectful
to the character.

1743
01:21:36,672 --> 01:21:40,403
I think this film is gonna
greatly satisfy all the genre fans,

1744
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:43,275
not just the hardcore
"Friday the 13th" fans.

1745
01:21:43,312 --> 01:21:45,712
It's not only remarkably scary,

1746
01:21:45,747 --> 01:21:47,305
but very very funny.

1747
01:21:47,349 --> 01:21:49,977
The mythology will stay intact.

1748
01:21:50,018 --> 01:21:51,485
Jason is still Jason.

1749
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:54,819
Our hope is that
the true fans

1750
01:21:54,856 --> 01:21:58,292
love the film as much as people
who've never seen the movie before.

1751
01:21:58,327 --> 01:22:00,557
We're hopeful
that all of our attempts

1752
01:22:00,596 --> 01:22:03,360
at authenticity
will have paid off for them,

1753
01:22:03,398 --> 01:22:05,332
and we suspect that they will,
but you never know.

1754
01:22:05,367 --> 01:22:08,928
I think, regardless,
they're gonna be pulled in,

1755
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:10,563
and that's that.

1756
01:22:10,606 --> 01:22:14,042
I'm excited to be a part of this...

1757
01:22:14,076 --> 01:22:16,670
colossal franchise.

1758
01:22:16,712 --> 01:22:19,909
To just be a part of the name
"Friday the 13th" is

1759
01:22:19,948 --> 01:22:21,779
a little exhilarating
I have to say.

1760
01:22:21,817 --> 01:22:23,785
We all love Jason Voorhees.
I mean, who doesn't?

1761
01:22:23,819 --> 01:22:27,346
Reggie will kick his butt. Reggie
the reckless will kick Jason's butt now.

1762
01:22:27,389 --> 01:22:30,517
I will put the red suit on,
and I will whip Jason's behind.

1763
01:22:30,559 --> 01:22:32,754
- I ain't playing.
- We can only hope that the people

1764
01:22:32,794 --> 01:22:35,524
who loved "Friday the 13th"
in the first place will be satisfied

1765
01:22:35,564 --> 01:22:38,897
with this newer, slicker,
kind of cooler version

1766
01:22:38,934 --> 01:22:41,129
of the story.
On the other hand,

1767
01:22:41,169 --> 01:22:44,502
I think that you're gonna have people
that are gonna see this new version

1768
01:22:44,539 --> 01:22:47,133
as the first "Friday the 13th"
they ever saw.

1769
01:22:47,175 --> 01:22:49,143
And this will hopefully

1770
01:22:49,177 --> 01:22:52,044
set a new level of quality

1771
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,140
so that the franchise
can continue forward.

1772
01:22:57,019 --> 01:22:59,180
- (insects chirping)
- (owl hooting)

1773
01:22:59,221 --> 01:23:01,086
Excuse me, miss,
is this yours?

1774
01:23:01,123 --> 01:23:03,023
I think you dropped...

1775
01:23:03,058 --> 01:23:05,151
she won't be needing this.

1776
01:23:05,193 --> 01:23:07,388
Over the years,
it's been the unstoppable Jason

1777
01:23:07,429 --> 01:23:10,865
that's kept moviegoers flocking
to theaters for a bloody good time,

1778
01:23:10,899 --> 01:23:13,026
but it's not just the fans
who appreciate

1779
01:23:13,068 --> 01:23:16,128
Jason's never-ending
reign of terror.

1780
01:23:22,878 --> 01:23:25,176
"Friday the 13th" has
had a life of its own.

1781
01:23:25,213 --> 01:23:26,680
It's quite amazing.

1782
01:23:26,715 --> 01:23:30,151
There are people
who just love this genre.

1783
01:23:30,185 --> 01:23:32,813
The "Friday the 13th" films
are an E ticket ride.

1784
01:23:32,854 --> 01:23:36,483
And I think people are constantly
ready to pay up for that ride.

1785
01:23:36,525 --> 01:23:39,983
On the night of its opening,
my wife said, "Let's go out to see it."

1786
01:23:40,028 --> 01:23:42,428
We went to six theaters that night,

1787
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:44,022
and we couldn't get in.

1788
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:46,193
We couldn't get in anywhere.
And I said to my wife,

1789
01:23:46,234 --> 01:23:48,259
"Holy cow, I think we really
did something here."

1790
01:23:48,303 --> 01:23:51,568
When I tell them
that I was in "Friday the 13th,"

1791
01:23:51,606 --> 01:23:52,766
it's so fun for me.

1792
01:23:52,808 --> 01:23:54,833
Thanks to "Friday the 13th,"

1793
01:23:54,876 --> 01:23:57,242
my 15 minutes keeps going.

1794
01:23:57,279 --> 01:23:59,770
Playing a character
that's known around the world

1795
01:23:59,815 --> 01:24:02,045
is an amazing feeling

1796
01:24:02,084 --> 01:24:04,382
and something
I'm really proud of.

1797
01:24:04,419 --> 01:24:06,614
There's really no putting
your finger on it,

1798
01:24:06,655 --> 01:24:08,282
but there seems to be a loyalty

1799
01:24:08,323 --> 01:24:11,417
and a fascination with it
that just drives it forward.

1800
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:13,189
It's really the audience

1801
01:24:13,228 --> 01:24:15,958
that brings Jason back
to life every time.

1802
01:24:15,997 --> 01:24:18,761
The legend grows
from picture to picture to picture.

1803
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,598
People like getting scared.
They don't know what's gonna happen.

1804
01:24:21,636 --> 01:24:23,467
They're just gonna wait... oh!

1805
01:24:23,505 --> 01:24:25,405
It surprises me
from time to time

1806
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,907
just about how

1807
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:29,911
the "Friday the 13th"
movies continue

1808
01:24:29,945 --> 01:24:32,937
and just go on and on. The
characters die, but the movie doesn't.

1809
01:24:32,981 --> 01:24:35,916
When you do "The Final Chapter,"
you expect for it

1810
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:37,748
to be the final chapter.

1811
01:24:37,786 --> 01:24:40,414
This was the last one.
We were doing the very last one.

1812
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:43,618
"The Final Friday,"

1813
01:24:43,658 --> 01:24:46,821
and I remember people saying
it's not gonna be the final "Friday."

1814
01:24:46,862 --> 01:24:48,557
That was 1992.

1815
01:24:48,597 --> 01:24:51,998
I get three, four, five
requests a week

1816
01:24:52,033 --> 01:24:55,560
for autographs and pictures
and so on from all over the world.

1817
01:24:55,604 --> 01:24:58,573
People still contact me.
They contact me about things

1818
01:24:58,607 --> 01:25:01,132
from the film
that I forgot about.

1819
01:25:01,176 --> 01:25:04,202
People send me things to sign...
big long posters.

1820
01:25:04,246 --> 01:25:05,907
I'm like,
"How did they get this?"

1821
01:25:05,947 --> 01:25:08,211
"Friday the 13th" has given me
a gift that

1822
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:10,946
is just bigger than life itself.

1823
01:25:10,986 --> 01:25:12,886
I get the most beautiful stories

1824
01:25:12,921 --> 01:25:15,947
about how Alice's strength
has inspired

1825
01:25:15,991 --> 01:25:18,255
so many people
around the world.

1826
01:25:18,293 --> 01:25:21,421
I was 27 years old
and I was the lead in a movie.

1827
01:25:21,463 --> 01:25:24,330
Number-one-box-office movie
at Paramount for two weekends.

1828
01:25:24,366 --> 01:25:26,926
This was the best
first acting gig I could have gotten.

1829
01:25:26,968 --> 01:25:29,368
Because when you have a knife
coming at you,

1830
01:25:29,404 --> 01:25:31,372
you really learn how
to hit your mark.

1831
01:25:31,406 --> 01:25:33,874
I hope the audience is
having as much fun watching this

1832
01:25:33,909 --> 01:25:35,900
- as we are making it.
- Personally, it was an honor...

1833
01:25:35,944 --> 01:25:38,174
still is an honor
to be associated with it.

1834
01:25:38,213 --> 01:25:40,181
And it's really
great entertainment,

1835
01:25:40,215 --> 01:25:42,706
so I think that's
why he's still around.

1836
01:25:42,751 --> 01:25:44,810
I think the audience
wants to see more Jason

1837
01:25:44,853 --> 01:25:46,878
the same way that
they want to see more Bond.

1838
01:25:46,922 --> 01:25:48,719
The same way they want
to see more Batman.

1839
01:25:48,757 --> 01:25:51,351
I've found that
a movie that I really

1840
01:25:51,393 --> 01:25:53,054
didn't give 2 for

1841
01:25:53,094 --> 01:25:55,085
in the beginning
has brought me

1842
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:57,530
into the world,
into the lives of people

1843
01:25:57,566 --> 01:26:00,467
who have viewed it
in a very special way.

1844
01:26:00,502 --> 01:26:02,595
Did you know that
a young boy drowned?

1845
01:26:02,637 --> 01:26:05,299
The counselors weren't
paying any attention.

1846
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:08,275
His name was Jason.

1847
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:12,110
Well, there you have it...
"Friday the 13th,"

1848
01:26:12,147 --> 01:26:14,809
a movie that was made
to keep filmmakers' lights on,

1849
01:26:14,850 --> 01:26:17,011
but made America
afraid to turn them off.

1850
01:26:17,052 --> 01:26:20,180
And one that singlehandedly
gave birth

1851
01:26:20,222 --> 01:26:22,190
to modern slasher cinema,

1852
01:26:22,224 --> 01:26:26,183
generating box office success
beyond anybody's wildest dreams.

1853
01:26:26,228 --> 01:26:28,822
You know,
"Friday the 13th" continues to inspire

1854
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:31,424
and influence
emerging filmmakers

1855
01:26:31,466 --> 01:26:34,162
who try to capture
their own lightning in a bottle.

1856
01:26:34,202 --> 01:26:36,864
And on top of that,
I can probably proclaim

1857
01:26:36,905 --> 01:26:40,306
that Jason Voorhees
is a pop-culture icon

1858
01:26:40,342 --> 01:26:43,072
recognized the world over.

1859
01:26:43,111 --> 01:26:45,875
So here we are.
It's three decades later,

1860
01:26:45,914 --> 01:26:47,848
and "Friday the 13th" lives on.

1861
01:26:47,883 --> 01:26:50,545
And it's because of you
that Jason Voorhees

1862
01:26:50,585 --> 01:26:52,883
keeps coming back
to terrify audiences.

1863
01:26:52,921 --> 01:26:55,549
So let me return the favor.
I'll give you some advice.

1864
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:57,956
If somebody invites you
to Camp Crystal Lake,

1865
01:26:57,993 --> 01:27:00,518
just don't go. (grunts)

1866
01:27:00,562 --> 01:27:02,393
(gasps)

1867
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:05,194
(sighs)
You see what I mean?

1868
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:11,933
My bad. Sorry.

1869
01:27:11,973 --> 01:27:15,306
(imitating soundtrack)

1870
01:27:17,245 --> 01:27:18,940
It's supposed to be...
"ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma."

1871
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:21,312
- Not everybody knows that.
- True, but that's the way it sounds.

1872
01:27:21,349 --> 01:27:24,250
I showed them how I can fart
"ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma,"

1873
01:27:24,286 --> 01:27:26,413
but the camera
wasn't rolling,

1874
01:27:26,454 --> 01:27:27,978
so yeah.

1875
01:27:28,023 --> 01:27:30,787
(rock music playing)

1876
01:27:37,966 --> 01:27:40,526
- I think if Vera had...
- (screams)

1877
01:27:42,337 --> 01:27:44,669
(screaming)

1878
01:27:47,008 --> 01:27:49,408
(screams)
Excuse me.

1879
01:27:49,444 --> 01:27:51,241
I thought it was Jason.

1880
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:53,577
Kill her, Mommy!
Kill her!

1881
01:27:53,615 --> 01:27:55,606
And he's still there.

1882
01:27:55,650 --> 01:27:59,177
There's somebody
in this fucking room!

1883
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:01,211
Why do you do
these stupid things?

1884
01:28:01,256 --> 01:28:02,746
I just want you to like me.

1885
01:28:02,791 --> 01:28:05,157
I got a date
with a soap on a rope.

1886
01:28:05,193 --> 01:28:08,321
Ted, Ted,
where's the corkscrew?

1887
01:28:08,363 --> 01:28:10,763
Come on, Sara,
strip and dip?

1888
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:13,596
Bad news crews.

1889
01:28:13,635 --> 01:28:16,604
It's okay, guys.
He just wants his machete back.

1890
01:28:16,638 --> 01:28:20,301
Axel, you are the Super Bowl
of self-abuse.

1891
01:28:20,342 --> 01:28:23,106
This feels good!

1892
01:28:23,144 --> 01:28:25,977
Nobody's gonna touch that
fucking ray of sunshine.

1893
01:28:26,014 --> 01:28:28,539
I have seen enough
horror movies to know

1894
01:28:28,583 --> 01:28:31,313
any weirdo wearing a mask
is never friendly.

1895
01:28:31,353 --> 01:28:33,617
That's what's known
as screwing the pooch.

1896
01:28:33,655 --> 01:28:37,557
Ben, are you coming back or not?
And then...

1897
01:28:37,592 --> 01:28:41,028
You didn't get me in the lake, Jason,
and you're not gonna get me now.

1898
01:28:43,164 --> 01:28:44,961
My earring.

1899
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,696
You could use a little
touch-up work first.

1900
01:28:49,771 --> 01:28:51,398
Man: And cut.

1901
01:28:51,439 --> 01:28:54,306
Melissa's a bitch.
I know... (laughing)

1902
01:28:54,342 --> 01:28:56,207
I can't even do it.

1903
01:28:56,244 --> 01:28:57,711
It's a real pain in the ass.

1904
01:28:57,746 --> 01:28:59,338
And you're gonna use that
for sure, I know.

1905
01:28:59,381 --> 01:29:01,872
I said, "It's a real pain in the ass."
You are gonna use that. I know that.

1906
01:29:01,916 --> 01:29:05,249
Finally he gets hacked to death
by Corey fucking Feldman?

1907
01:29:05,286 --> 01:29:07,220
Yo, Feld-dawg,
what the fuck?

1908
01:29:07,255 --> 01:29:08,984
(smacks)

1909
01:29:09,024 --> 01:29:11,015
I'm getting Haim
on your ass. Sorry.

1910
01:29:11,059 --> 01:29:13,493
- (growls)
- (screams)

1911
01:29:15,163 --> 01:29:17,825
I found it.

1912
01:29:17,866 --> 01:29:19,663
I didn't have a clue
as to what the plot was

1913
01:29:19,701 --> 01:29:21,498
in "Jason Goes to Hell."

1914
01:29:21,536 --> 01:29:23,834
A lot of shaving.

1915
01:29:23,872 --> 01:29:26,534
It's creepy.
It's so creepy.

1916
01:29:26,574 --> 01:29:29,737
Homoerotic... shaven.

1917
01:29:29,778 --> 01:29:32,906
(speaks gibberish)

1918
01:29:32,947 --> 01:29:35,541
Never show your breasts...
(laughing)

1919
01:29:37,085 --> 01:29:39,053
Here comes first Jason!

1920
01:29:39,087 --> 01:29:41,612
We're gonna go up to Crystal Lake
even though we've heard

1921
01:29:41,656 --> 01:29:43,624
that there's horrible things...
oh my God!

1922
01:29:43,658 --> 01:29:45,888
There's bananas everywhere.

1923
01:29:45,927 --> 01:29:49,385
It is a lot easier
to go watch Jason

1924
01:29:49,431 --> 01:29:51,592
than it is to watch Dick Cheney.

1925
01:29:51,633 --> 01:29:53,362
You give up?

1926
01:29:53,401 --> 01:29:55,392
Man: Never!

1927
01:29:56,705 --> 01:29:58,639
I don't know
what my lines are.

1928
01:29:58,673 --> 01:30:00,766
There's only one thing

1929
01:30:00,809 --> 01:30:03,710
that Jason knows,
and he knows it well.

1930
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:07,871
(man softly)
Kill!

1931
01:30:07,872 --> 01:30:08,872
