1
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,800
- It's undignified.
- Bollocks.

2
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,000
It's one of the reasons
our sperm counts are plummeting.

3
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,100
- More bollocks.
- It's against nature.

4
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,100
If a man and a woman are in a car,
the man should drive.

5
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,400
- Is this it?
- I think so.

6
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,900
You can drive back
if it makes you feel better.

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,900
Yes.

8
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,300
All right, lads?
Is your mum or dad about?

9
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,300
We don't have mums and dads.

10
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,300
We have elders.

11
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,100
Please go away.

12
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,800
- I have to present you with this.
- You have no jurisdiction here.

13
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,000
- Your authority is not recognised.
- I've got a job to do.

14
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,800
With regard to
the non-attendance of minors...

15
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,100
You don't exist. wait here.

16
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,100
This is Rossborough. 7312.

17
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,900
We have a... Oh, God.

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,700
Shooting. we have a man wounded.
Stony... Shit.

19
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,700
- 'What is the message?

20
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,900
- 'Rosie? '
- No,

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,400
'This is control. Over. what's going on? '
- Please don't.

22
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,200
'Hello? Rosie? Hello?

23
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,900
'Come in please. Rosie, come in please.'

24
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,900
And the Lord said,

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,200
"I will destroy man whom I have created
from the face of the earth."

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,300
'The Stonyhurst siege
moves into its second week

27
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,900
'with no immediate prospect
of resolution.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,200
'Negotiators have failed
to establish rapport... '

29
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,400
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

30
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,800
Pete, why don't you...

31
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,800
These pans look like they haven't
been cleaned in ten years. Look at this.

32
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,800
Pete, it's me. Please, will you stop this?
I can't bear it any more.

33
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,600
Then keep the pans clean.
I do my side of things. You do yours.

34
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,300
Will you listen? I said I can't stand it!

35
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Then leave.

36
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,800
Pete.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
- This is... storage stuff.
- Not bad.

38
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,700
You'd get a wife and three kids in there.

39
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,100
- It's your room for when you stay.

40
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,700
- That's your doorbell.
- Yeah. Should get that changed.

41
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,800
You'll want to.

42
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Hello.

43
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,300
Hello. I'm Beth. Jamie's sister.

44
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,600
Are you going to let 'em in or what?

45
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,800
It was at the crematorium.
There were a few people there.

46
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,500
- And some flowers.
- We missed you.

47
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,200
- Yeah, well, you know...
- Who wants milk?

48
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,000
Who wants it black?

49
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,600
- Conrad made us leave Mum's house.
- He was waiting for Mum to pass away.

50
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,400
Look, Beth, there's room...

51
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,600
- Peter, I told you!
- Show him yours!

52
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,800
What's he done to you?

53
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,700
Beth, has he hurt you?

54
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,400
- Let it go. And you.
- I can't let it go.

55
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,400
He's gone.

56
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,400
- He's not gone.
- That part of our life is over. Let it go.

57
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,000
With a deadlock in the siege,
the Home Office want us down there.

58
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,600
Our role is to consult,
support and prepare.

59
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,200
We'd be mad to get involved.
There are children in there.

60
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,000
Nobody's asking us to blow the place up
and slaughter the innocents.

61
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,600
Why else would they call us in?
What else can prepare me?

62
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,500
There's nothing to discuss. It's an order.

63
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,300
Comes as an order to me and that damn
well means it's an order from me to you.

64
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,200
And if you use your considerable
diplomatic skills to avoid any bloodshed,

65
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,700
nobody will be more delighted than me.

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,800
With regard to Pete,
I'm wondering if you were right

67
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,800
to block his return to Ops after Bosnia.
You must keep an eye on him.

68
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,100
Sir.

69
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,000
We never talked.

70
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,100
About what?

71
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
About me and you.

72
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
What about me and you?

73
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,600
- When we were having a...
- Sex.

74
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,900
Yeah.

75
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,400
And then you were shot.
And now we're not.

76
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Henno found out. Said we should stop.
You agreed, so we stopped.

77
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,700
End of story. Lesson learned.

78
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,400
No cover for attackers
Within 60 metres of the building.

79
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,100
Power was cut, but they have
their own electricity generation,

80
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,900
water supply and appear
to have large reserves of food.

81
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,900
Security lighting, CCTV cameras

82
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
and lookouts covering all the angles,
posted 24/7.

83
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
This is their leader.

84
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,000
He calls himself Omega. We've
identified him as Donald Klissman, 38,

85
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,300
Gulf war veteran.

86
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Probably came back with
Gulf war Syndrome, PTSD and God.

87
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,000
This is the sort of thing
he's been saying to our negotiator.

88
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:34,100
'Babylon the great, the mother of harlots
and abominations of the earth,

89
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,300
'has become the habitation of devils
for all nations.

90
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,100
'For all nations have drunk
the wine of her fornication.

91
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,800
'Kings have fornicated with her
and merchants have waxed rich

92
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,800
'through her abundant delicacies.'

93
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:53,400
'His small community of disciples
comprises eight children,

94
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,000
'from 16 down to six months,

95
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,200
'nine adult females
and at least 11 adult males.

96
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,800
'There are probably more.
A few have been identified.

97
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,400
'Misfits looking for answers, convinced
they've found them with Klissman.'

98
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,100
- 'Weapons? '

99
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,800
'we've seen assault
and sniper rifles and shotguns.

100
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,000
'They have purchased materials
from filling stations

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,500
'and hardware stores,
adequate to produce fire bombs

102
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,500
'and homemade PE4 and napalm.'

103
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,800
- 'We'll set up a DPA... '
- 'Any hostages? '

104
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
'Not that we're aware of.'

105
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,700
- Good, well, that...
- And negotiations?

106
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,900
- Sorry, sir. Go ahead.
- No, please.

107
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,300
Have negotiations thrown up
any demands or objectives?

108
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Negotiations are indefinitely stalemated.

109
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
He just rants.
He doesn't seem to want anything.

110
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,300
Our position is we'll give them as long
as it takes for a peaceful resolution.

111
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,100
- What's your real position?
- We'd like it sorted ASAP.

112
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,500
The children are at risk,
not least from sanitary conditions.

113
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,600
The siege is affecting air traffic.
It's bad PR.

114
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,500
Minority groups say we're doing this
because they're Christians.

115
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,800
I prefer your first position. Starve them
out or let them blow themselves up.

116
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,800
- Let's not be crude.
- I'm being practical.

117
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,900
He's trying to recreate waco.
We shouldn't help him.

118
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,700
The brief is to examine
and prepare a range of options,

119
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,000
up to and including armed assault.

120
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,800
Why are there no armoured vehicles,
even if it's just to retrieve dead bodies,

121
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,300
seeing as they're shooting
at everything?

122
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,900
Looks very bad, armour against civilians.

123
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,200
It may look bad, but it sure as hell feels
a lot better when you're being shot at.

124
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,000
We need to take five guys
round the back. Five round the front...

125
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
Sergeant Garvie.

126
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,200
- That was outrageous.
- Yes, I know, but you'll improve.

127
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,800
- What?
- You heard.

128
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,400
Your insubordination is unsupportable.

129
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,900
That was a discussion.
That's how we operate.

130
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,400
- You behaved appallingly.
- You are very keen suddenly for a fight.

131
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,800
Like you have something to prove.
Just take a breath and think.

132
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,000
I haven't finished.

133
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,000
Never use force
unless you are certain you will win.

134
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,600
You're a very silly boy.

135
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,100
- Don't know what you mean.
- Sister Beth said to forget about him.

136
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,500
She's right.

137
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

138
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,700
There are cameras all the way
up to Manchester and all the way back.

139
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,400
It will take plod
five minutes to suss you.

140
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,900
If it's murder or GBH,
it's the end of you, young man.
(Grievous Bodily Harm)

141
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,200
Am I right?

142
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Am I right?

143
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,200
You're right.

144
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,100
Thanks.

145
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,500
- Anything useful?
- Could be.

146
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,200
'You said they had a water supply? '

147
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,400
'Artesian spring in the courtyard.'

148
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,700
'And drains connect to main drainage.'

149
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,500
This culvert was used to bring
spring water out into the fields.

150
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,100
We may be able to use it
to gain access to the courtyard.

151
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,500
- You've got to be kidding.
- Forget it.

152
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,200
We need eyes and ears in the
stronghold. This could be the answer.

153
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,600
Forget it.

154
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,700
It's going to get too tight
for breathing apparatus.

155
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,500
It's a balls job.

156
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,700
You're sick.

157
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,500
Like he said, it's a balls job.

158
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,800
The man's attitude is intolerable.

159
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,700
The man's attitude
is a large part of the man.

160
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,900
And the man is the best soldier
in the best regiment

161
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,200
in the best army in the world.

162
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,100
You'd be better advised trying to learn
from him, rather than dominate him.

163
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,400
- You'd gas yourself.
- Yeah. Boss.

164
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,800
- Morning.
- Boss.

165
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:54,200
A kango wouldn't be that funny either.
A controlled explosion.

166
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,600
With the emphasis on control,
or you bring down the culvert.

167
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,200
And attract the attention
of the Jesus mob.

168
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,200
- I'll deal with that.
- Caroline, bung me the keys.

169
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,800
I need some plastic and detonators.

170
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Find me the biggest skip lorry you can
lay your hands on and get it here ASAP.

171
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,900
Sir, we found a culvert.

172
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Runs from here to here. We're getting
Pete to clear a concrete collar inside.

173
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,700
We should be clear
all the way to the courtyard.

174
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,700
- Wouldn't it be better to do it at night?
- No. Essential we do it by day.

175
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,900
- Well... Excuse me.

176
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,200
What are you looking at?

177
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Freedom.

178
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,200
The real world.

179
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,100
What do you mean?

180
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
You know.

181
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,200
No, I don't.

182
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,100
I wish it were different.

183
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,500
I wish I could take you out to a film or...

184
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,800
We're all afraid, Michael,
but we're all God's children.

185
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,600
We offer him our unquestioning faith
and he chooses

186
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,500
whether to accept our sacrifice
or leave us to fight again another day.

187
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,400
Don't be afraid of the fear.

188
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,100
Savour it.

189
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,900
What's that?

190
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,600
- A skip.
- Skip.

191
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:09,000
"Thunder and hail and fire
ran along the ground.

192
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,600
"And hell and death
were cast into the fire."

193
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,200
For God's sake.
It was just a skip.

194
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,100
For whose sake, Michael?

195
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Oh, it's a boy.

196
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,900
- Well?
- It's clear.

197
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,800
All right, we're stood down until 0500.
We'll take another look then.

198
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,200
A hotel in town
for anyone wanting a bath.

199
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,300
Mobile phones and bleepers on
at all times. It's a 30-minute standby.

200
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Stood to at 0500.

201
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,800
There's a good Indian in town.
Fancy a curry?

202
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,300
Yeah, why not?

203
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,100
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

204
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,200
There are people from the regiment
staying here. Jamie...

205
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,200
What are you doing here?

206
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,800
- I knew you'd be here. I had to see you.
- I can't believe you drove down.

207
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,500
It didn't take long.

208
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,900
Are you all right?

209
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,700
No, not really.

210
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,500
You kissed me in Hereford.

211
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,100
Yes.

212
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,900
Like you meant it.

213
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,200
Well, I did.

214
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,800
Do you want me?

215
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,000
- What about Pete?
- Forget Pete.

216
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,800
He's no angel.

217
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,200
You're quite shy.

218
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,500
- I wasn't expecting that.
- I'm...

219
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,100
Come on. It's fine.
No one's giving marks out of ten.

220
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,600
- Go away.

221
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,200
- What is it?
- No, I...

222
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,600
Hey, hey. Have you been to see Pete?

223
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:18,400
You mustn't tell him you've seen me
here. Jamie, I think I'm going mad.

224
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:41,000
Jamie, please don't tell anyone
you've seen me here.

225
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,800
- Tell them what?
- Just promise.

226
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,100
- Ah, Pru.
- Pete.

227
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,400
- Have you seen Jamie?
- No, aren't you staying here?

228
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,600
I wish. A B&B down the road.
Me and Jamie are going for an Indian.

229
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,700
- Do you want to join us?
- No. I don't think...

230
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,700
Ah, the wee man.

231
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,300
- Where have you been?
- Checking the garden.

232
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,200
Another hidden talent.
I'm starving. Are you sure?

233
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,400
Absolutely. Stuff to do.
You two have a good time.

234
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,100
- Everything all right, sir?
- Yeah, fine.

235
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,600
- You're very quiet.
- Just tired, mate.

236
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,100
- We should get an early one.
- I'm getting banana fritters.

237
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,500
Excuse me. Do you have banana fritters?

238
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,500
Just the one fritters, please.

239
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,500
What are you looking at?

240
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,900
Whoa, Pete. Take it easy, mate.

241
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,600
- What?
- Are you all right?

242
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,600
- Why? Because I've ordered fritters?
- You're not your usual self.

243
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,300
- What are you on about?
- Mate, is something bothering you?

244
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,600
What do you mean? It's like
having dinner with my bloody wife.

245
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,700
I'm in high spirits
and you want an encounter group.

246
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,200
All right.

247
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,200
You don't mind putting this
on your gold card, do you?

248
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,900
I'm busted.

249
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,100
Piss off, Conrad. Go home.

250
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Night, Tony.

251
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:39,700
Wanker. Stick your pub up your arse.

252
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,100
Why aren't you in town with the others?

253
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Why aren't you?

254
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
Are you married?

255
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,400
I'm separated.

256
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,700
- You?
- Mm-mm.

257
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,500
Why do you ask?

258
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,500
Interested.

259
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,900
- There's no sugar in that.
- I know.

260
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
What, interested in me?

261
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,900
Well, yes, actually.

262
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,000
Good. Cos I'm interested in you.

263
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,300
I know.

264
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,400
When I first saw you, I wondered
What you did in your spare time.

265
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,100
Eat takeaways and watch
Sex And The City. what did you imagine?

266
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,800
- Wagner, Chablis.
- How flattering.

267
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,900
I...

268
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,100
- All right, Sean, any news?
- Been to the end of the culvert.

269
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,900
There's a grille,
but you can get through it.

270
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,700
- Good.
- Nice find, that. Gold star for Red Troop.

271
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,900
- Cheers, mate.
- Not taking advantage of the hotels?

272
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm preparing to clear up the mess
Blue Troop leave behind after their shift.

273
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,600
- Cheers.
- Night, mate.

274
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,100
- Which is the problem.
- Yes.

275
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,300
- Golden rule. Never at work.
- And with me.

276
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,200
So when do you knock off?

277
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,700
Whenever we finish here
and after the debrief at Hereford.

278
00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:00,100
Can I ask you something,
in confidence and off the record?

279
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,700
Yeah, sure.

280
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,600
Would Pete bring his wife down
When there's an operation on?

281
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:14,600
- Never. Not in a million years. why?
- No, no, I saw her just now in town.

282
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm pretty sure
Pete didn't know she was here.

283
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
What, is that it?

284
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,900
Look, if it's something else,
then you have to tell me.

285
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
She was with Jamie.

286
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,000
- In the car park at the hotel.
- Jamie?

287
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,100
- They were...
- Sergeant, something's happening.

288
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,800
- That's promising.
- Yes, sir.

289
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,500
Michael!

290
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,900
Don't betray the Lord.

291
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,600
Run, you fool. Run.

292
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,800
Weave. For Christ's sake, weave.

293
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,600
- Argh!

294
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,200
- Don't. You'll kick it all off.

295
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,800
We're not prepared for that. Not yet.

296
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,400
Hold your fire, everyone.
I repeat, hold your fire.

297
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,000
I want Red Troop stood to ASAP. Over.

298
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,100
'Got that.'

299
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,900
- You told them not to give covering fire?
- Yes.

300
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,700
He could have told us who was in there,
what weapons they were using...

301
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,400
- Yes, sir.
- How are people going to view this?

302
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,700
I don't really care. We were in no position
to respond or to control the situation.

303
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,800
- It was still a police investigation.
- Sir, we have work to do. Where's Ricky?

304
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,600
Isn't he back? I sent him to the late-night
garage to get Vaseline for detonators.

305
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:26,100
Henno, Ian, there's been
a possible development.

306
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
You were right about dispositions
within the stronghold.

307
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,100
- Maybe now we can get them.
- What do you mean?

308
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,900
We put someone through the culvert
and try and get her out.

309
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,300
What if she puts up a fight or screams?

310
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,900
We just have to make sure she doesn't.

311
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,200
Got a job for you.
Louis, you're in support.

312
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,900
- Where's...
- Wally.

313
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,500
Pete. I reckon that'll get you through
a few more games of gay before bed.

314
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,900
They love it. They do. They love it.

315
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:15,100
We've got an X-ray needs snatching.
Jamie and Louis to the culvert.

316
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,800
The rest of us and Blue Troop
in support. we go in five.

317
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,200
I'm going to take my hand away.

318
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,400
If you scream, I will shoot you
in the head. Do you understand?

319
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,900
Got that.

320
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,100
They're on their way back.

321
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,500
Stage three.

322
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,200
That lad certainly has a way with women.

323
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:29,200
"His eyes were as a flame of fire
and on his head he had many crowns,

324
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:34,300
"And he had a name written
that no man knew, but himself."

325
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,700
I don't think there's any answer to that.

326
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,500
Your mother met Klissman
nine years ago, when you were ten.

327
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,200
So that means Klissman's
not the father of your two brothers.

328
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,800
Jonathan and Thomas.

329
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,900
They were in there with you.

330
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,900
You know he intends to blow you all up?

331
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,900
He means for you all to die.

332
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,200
"And God shall wipe away
all tears from their eyes,

333
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:19,400
"And there shall be no more death.
Neither shall there be any more pain."

334
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,400
You don't think he'll give up?

335
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,800
So you came out and left your two little
brothers in there with that creep?

336
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,000
"And there will be no more death."

337
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:42,000
You see, I too love the Lord Jesus.

338
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,300
But I wouldn't gamble my brothers' lives
on a random passage from the Bible.

339
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,600
It says Abraham,

340
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:56,500
although 600 years old, still managed
to get his sister Sarah pregnant.

341
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,500
Genesis, chapter 20.

342
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,000
It also says, after his wife turned to salt,

343
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,100
that Lot managed to shag
his young daughters.

344
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,800
But this was OK because he got
the nod from a passing angel.

345
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,800
I think these days, if that came to court,

346
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:23,400
the judges would find these visits from
passing angels a little bit convenient

347
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,900
and lock the dirty bastards up
for a couple of years, don't you?

348
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,400
Now my tea's cold.

349
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,900
That's very good.
The brothers are definitely the key.

350
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,300
We don't have any time to waste.

351
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,400
I think we're going to
need shock treatment.

352
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,100
- Henno, can I have a word?
- Yeah. Sure.

353
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,100
Is that your brother Thomas?

354
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Actually, it's not.

355
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,500
At the moment, your brother is still alive.

356
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,200
This kid, the one with half his face
and stomach missing,

357
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,300
lived for two days
after this photograph was taken.

358
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:57,000
Now, when we go in, if we know where
people are, where the weapons are,

359
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,700
where the firebombs have been placed,

360
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,600
there's a good chance of bringing
your brothers out alive.

361
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,500
If we go in blind, everyone will die.

362
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,000
You have 20 minutes.

363
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,000
Hello?

364
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,500
I'll go call my bosses.

365
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,200
After the original shooting,
three cars left the stronghold,

366
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,900
carrying between them four men
and two women.

367
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,700
Susannah says these pairs are teams
called Earth, Air and Water.

368
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Which suggests that Klissman is Fire.

369
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,900
She confirmed the stronghold
is one giant bomb.

370
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,900
- Petrol cans in every corner.
- The other three are sleeper cells.

371
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,800
Waiting for him to give his word.

372
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:33,400
Which he seems likely to do
when he finds out the girl is gone.

373
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,400
We're at the point where an immediate attack
is inevitable.

374
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,900
There are still good reasons for not
going in. Eight of the kids are under 16.

375
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,400
Catch him alive and expose him
for abusing minors.

376
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,200
Right. We will prepare
a direct plan of action.

377
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,500
Then assess what's possible
and make a decision. Light by seven.

378
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,600
Last chance for a go would be 0600.

379
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,100
It's now 0240.

380
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,400
DPA by 0340.

381
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,400
Right, bombs here, here
and possibly here. Wires there and there.

382
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,800
On the outside of the building in
the courtyard. Will it be OK to cut them?

383
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:16,000
He won't have them on a live circuit.
So we can cut away.

384
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,900
I'll get bomb disposal
to send some of their ECM boys.
(Electronic CounterMeasures)

385
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,600
Good. Right. Our five smallest through
the culvert. Jamie, on wire-cutting duty.

386
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,500
- Have that.
- No, me. why waste him on wires?

387
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,200
Pru knows what she's doing on comms.
Put me in.

388
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,800
I don't have a problem with that.

389
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:40,300
All right. Bring Pru up to speed
with call signs.

390
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,700
'Team One to wires.
All other teams to FMPs.'

391
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,400
'X-ray down in side entrance.'

392
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,500
All in position now.

393
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,900
And... stage one.

394
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,500
'Stand by.

395
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,500
'Stand by. Go.'

396
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:34,400
Stage two. Stand by. Stand by.

397
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,900
'Go.'

398
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:45,100
'Romeo Four Zero Bravo.
Team A and B into building by door 1-5.'

399
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,600
'Have that.'

400
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,700
Hey. we're making sandwiches.
Do you want cheese and pickle?

401
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,300
No pickle. Just cheese and ham.

402
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,700
'Two X-rays down in 1-3.'

403
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
'Have that.'

404
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:44,500
'Romeo Four Zero Bravo.
X-ray down in 1-2.'

405
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,500
'Have that.'

406
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:13,200
'Romeo Two, Zero, Bravo,
X-ray secured in two-alpha.'

407
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,900
Go, go, go.

408
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,400
Sod that.

409
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:59,300
Romeo Four Zero Bravo.
Four X-rays in 2-7. Secured door. Out.

410
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,300
They're coming in the back.

411
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,200
Into thy hands, Lord.

412
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,700
No!

413
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,000
Move it!

414
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,300
Go.

415
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,300
Move it!

416
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,700
This is Romeo One Zero Bravo.

417
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,100
We are pinned down at the base
of the stairs in 1-1 by X-ray Two

418
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,800
at the top of the stairs.
Need support. Over.

419
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,800
I'm on it.

420
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,300
Hey, boy, you drop it.

421
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,800
Right, we need X-ray One alive.

422
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,800
On three, I move right,
you take out his hands.

423
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:04,700
On three. One, two...

424
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,100
"To him that overcometh,
I will give a white stone,

425
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,300
"And in that stone a name written
that no man knoweth,

426
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,400
"saving he that receiveth it."

427
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,800
Shut up.

428
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:06,800
You, back in the car with me.

429
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,900
I need a piss.

430
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:39,300
Let's get cleared up, cleaned up
and back to OH. Debrief 1300.

431
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,500
- Yeah. Good work, guys.
- Well done, yourself.

432
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:52,500
Sorry to bother you, mate.
Do you know where James Dow is?

433
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,300
James Dow?

434
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,800
- Could I have a word?
- What about?

435
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,900
Conrad Boyd.

436
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,900
You know who I mean.

437
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:26,100
- What about him?
- He were killed last night.

438
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,300
Good.

439
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,600
- Was there any trouble between you?
- I hated him. How did he die?

440
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,200
- Beaten to death with a brick.
- Nice one.

441
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,500
I hope it hurt.
Someone saved me the trouble.

442
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,900
Would you have any idea where you
Were at 11:30 last night?

443
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,600
Yeah, I was...

444
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:54,200
I was at an Indian restaurant
here in town.

445
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,900
- Would there be witnesses to that?
- Yeah. Yeah. Plenty of witnesses.

446
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,400
Thanks. We may have
to come back to you on that.

447
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,000
- Yeah, whatever mate. Good luck.
- Cheers.

448
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,500
- Nice job in there. well done.
- Cheers.

449
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,600
I'm sorry.

450
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:47,100
I'm sorry. I was afraid. I'm sick.

451
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:50,800
I'll take counselling.

452
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,900
Marriage guidance.

453
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,900
I'll dye my hair.

454
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,700
Whatever it takes to make it up to you.

455
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,200
The immersion's on.

456
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,900
Get out.

457
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,000
I've a pretty good idea what your mate
did for you last night.

458
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:11,800
I wonder if he'd been so keen if he knew
you were sleeping with Pete's wife.

459
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,800
- What?
- You were seen in the hotel car park.

460
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,200
You've got it wrong. Aah!

461
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,500
- Now, was she there or wasn't she?
- Yeah, but...

462
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,000
- So why was she there?
- I can't say.

463
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,200
Listen to me. I can't say!

464
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,400
Who is it?

465
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,500
Who is it?

466
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,000
I can't say.
