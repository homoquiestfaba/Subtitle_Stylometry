1
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:25,987
So you guys all know the story
of Camp Crystal Lake, right?

2
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,751
I mean, come on, surely you
have to know about the legend.

3
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,492
All right, well listen.

4
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,029
I don't want to scare anyone...

5
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,725
but I'm gonna give it to you
straight about Jason.

6
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,298
It all happened
at Camp Crystal Lake...

7
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,668
Camp Blood.

8
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,604
And Jason...was just
a little boy at the time.

9
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,143
He drowned one night.

10
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,286
His mom, who worked
at the camp...

11
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,786
she blamed all the counselors.

12
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,715
Said it was their fault.

13
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,358
She decided to kill
each and every one of them.

14
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:07,623
Well, legend has it
that Jason didn't drown.

15
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,195
He survived.

16
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,770
And he watched his mother
get beheaded that night.

17
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,505
He took his revenge.

18
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:21,442
Every year, on Friday the 1 3th,

19
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:25,742
Jason would just keep
coming back.

20
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:29,349
Now if you listen
to the old timers in town,

21
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,752
they say that Jason's
still out there,

22
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:37,129
Which means the Voorhees Curse
is alive and well.

23
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:41,424
Friday the 13th is his day.

24
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,136
And Camp Crystal Lake...

25
00:01:44,370 --> 00:02:54,172
is his domain.

26
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:58,241
We had this tiny little movie
that cost $500,000,

27
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,504
which to date has grossed
just under a billion dollars.

28
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:05,343
It's just an amazing phenomenon.

29
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,486
And not only were we shocked
and surprised and pleased,

30
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:12,452
but amazed that we even
finished the film.

31
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,252
I hear from people
all over the world,

32
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:19,329
and I don't quite understand
what the wonderful,

33
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:23,332
captivating thing is
about this particular film.

34
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,800
I never dreamed when
I was doing the film then

35
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,729
the effect it would have
on so many people.

36
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,771
There's actually a lot
of thought

37
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,940
and a lot of real talent
that goes into these pictures.

38
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,212
"Friday the 1 3th"
was one of the innovators,

39
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,474
I would say,
of this slasher movie

40
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,743
but where the characters
all represented people

41
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,956
that each one of us knew.

42
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,358
The best horror
movies find a way

43
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,652
to tap into something
that's truly human.

44
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,296
And there is something so
compelling about the genre

45
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,626
that people will always
come back to it.

46
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,336
I think that the goal is about
scaring the audience

47
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,232
and fear and vulnerability.

48
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:02,703
We don't know why but
it's something in us

49
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:04,273
that likes to be scared.

50
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:05,977
I don't watch the movie,

51
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,778
I pick somebody out
in the audience,

52
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,745
and then watch the evolution
of their heart attack.

53
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:13,782
It's not rocket science.
It's fun. It's exciting.

54
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,284
The fans so adore
this character.

55
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,513
They like Jason more
than they like the survivors.

56
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,851
They sort of
brought a life to it,

57
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,421
that it would have never had
without 'em.

58
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,858
That's where the power lies
is Jason never dies

59
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,891
because the audience
brings him back to life,

60
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:31,360
the devoted fans of Jason.

61
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,731
It's a great character to watch
and see what he'll do next.

62
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:37,568
I don't think it'll really ever
come to a complete end.

63
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,802
A lot of us relate to Jason
because Jason is the outcast.

64
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,981
Like in school, either you're
too tall, you're too short,

65
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,940
you're too heavy,
you have buck teeth,

66
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,252
you speak with a lisp,
we all tie in somehow,

67
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:50,388
going, 'Oh, I understand that,
I was the different kid.'

68
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,022
It's just a basic part
of the human struggle.

69
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,255
Jason represents that force that
you're going to come up against.

70
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,428
You know, we all want to be
that person

71
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,961
that feels like we can,
you know, stop evil

72
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,367
and save the person
that we love.

73
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,535
I think that we need
these monsters, these bogeymen,

74
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,568
these characters who embody
all evil

75
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,933
because we can't deal
with the real evil

76
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,502
that we have to
in our day to day lives.

77
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:14,042
If you can take that darkness
out and look at it,

78
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,708
then you can conquer it,
you can defeat it,

79
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:17,472
you can actually deal with it.

80
00:05:17,717 --> 00:05:18,775
It's when we try and hide it
from the light

81
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:36,357
that it overcomes us.

82
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,297
In the early 1 970's,

83
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,904
Connecticut-based filmmaker
Sean S. Cunningham

84
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,638
was struggling to make
a name for himself,

85
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,467
scraping by on a diet

86
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,303
of industrial shorts
and commercials

87
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,310
and even the occasional
soft-core porn.

88
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:50,948
Back in the early 70's,
a big change was happening

89
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,851
in the movie business.

90
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,815
There had been success
with documentary forms

91
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,352
and with hand-held cameras.

92
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,082
And there was a sense of
anything was possible.

93
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:03,995
You know, just grab your camera,
grab your equipment,

94
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,556
get in the back of the station
wagon and go shoot it.

95
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:06,696
You can compete
with the big guys.

96
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,833
He was making little movies.

97
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,865
There was a film he made
called "Together,"

98
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,833
and it starred Marilyn Chambers

99
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,039
who went to the local
high school.

100
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,999
It was a marital aid film

101
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,503
for couples who were trying to
strengthen their marital bond,

102
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,738
as it would be, in the bedroom.

103
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:25,576
We had a mutual friend.
His name was Bud Talbot,

104
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:27,786
who I was working with
on a film.

105
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,681
I think he helped Sean raise
some of the money,

106
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:32,789
and uh, this movie, "Case of the
Full Moon Murders,"

107
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,890
and it starred Harry Reams.
It was very soft.

108
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,062
In the softcore world.

109
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,432
7:35 a. m.
We were shown to a bedroom.

110
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,395
A male corpse
with an enormous erection

111
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:43,897
was covered with a blanket.

112
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:46,537
Our suspicions
were immediately aroused.

113
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:48,138
In the mid-seventies,
everybody said we need

114
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,405
nice, clean, wholesome films.

115
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:52,543
So we did two very nice, clean,
wholesome films.

116
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:56,442
And they made absolutely
zero dollars.

117
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,515
And now I had to get
another job.

118
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,686
Somehow or other I had to get
something going.

119
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:06,153
That something turned out to be
1 972's "Last House On the Left."

120
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,992
To avoid fainting,
keep repeating:

121
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:12,557
"It's only a movie.
Only a movie..."

122
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,494
The film
produced by Cunningham,

123
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,599
and directed by Wes Craven,

124
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,770
who would go on to create 1 984's
"A Nightmare On Elm Street,"

125
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:21,030
presented a brutal portrait

126
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,671
of violence and visceral horror
in small-town America.

127
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:29,405
Well, we were co-producers
of "Last House on the Left,"

128
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,674
which I think was
a very important horror film.

129
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,512
And it's still playing today
all over the world.

130
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,187
Although none of
Sean Cunningham's early efforts

131
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,146
achieved mainstream success,

132
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:42,118
his next brainchild,
with a considerable debt

133
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,089
owed to John Carpenter's 1 978
screen shocker "Halloween,"

134
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:49,558
would launch a whole new
sub-genre of horror.

135
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,896
I had thought of this title
some time ago

136
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,163
called Friday the 1 3th.
And I said to myself,

137
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,098
'lf I had a film called
Friday the 1 3th,

138
00:07:57,543 --> 00:07:58,942
I could sell that.

139
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,975
And Sean called me up and said,

140
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:03,444
"Halloween" is making incredible
money at the box office,

141
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,547
Iet's rip it off."

142
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:06,877
That is keeping it real.

143
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,051
And I said,
"Here's what we're gonna do.

144
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,115
We're gonna take out an ad
in Variety,

145
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,786
and put at the top 'From the
people who brought you

146
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,994
"Last House on the Left"

147
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,697
comes the most terrifying
film ever made.

148
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,558
"Friday the 1 3th."

149
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,529
And that's all we had.

150
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,894
We really didn't know what we
were going to make.

151
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:24,192
We just wanted to see if anybody
would be interested

152
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,901
in buying it.

153
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,800
Cunningham was able
to secure financing

154
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,941
for "Friday the 1 3th"
through the same trio

155
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,235
of east coast investors

156
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,872
who funded and distributed

157
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,240
"Last House on the Left."

158
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,742
Robert Barsamian, Stephen
Minasian, and Philip Scuderi,

159
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:42,716
owners of
the Esquire Theaters chain,

160
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,685
and who, under their Georgetown
Productions banner,

161
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,519
were ready to make their mark
on motion picture history.

162
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:52,663
But first, they needed
one thing: a script.

163
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,696
The longest part
of the process

164
00:08:54,934 --> 00:08:56,561
of creating the first
"Friday the 1 3th"

165
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:58,736
was figuring out the venue.

166
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:01,769
So I had to find some territory

167
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:04,101
that was adult-free,
more-or-less.

168
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,068
Camp Crystal Lake is jinxed!

169
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:08,803
Oh, terrific.

170
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,743
So we came up with summer camp,
Sean said, "let's go with it,"

171
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:12,280
and that was that.

172
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,946
The thing about the story
in "Friday the 1 3th,"

173
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,622
is that it's so
profoundly simple.

174
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,518
I think part of that
had to do with the fact

175
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,091
that we had very little time
to waste

176
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,126
on conventional things
like character and plot.

177
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,625
We had this notion
that these kids

178
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,301
would be out at a summer camp,

179
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,261
and would be threatened by some
kind of serial killer,

180
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:36,174
and we would then be surprised
to discover

181
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:37,701
who the serial killer was
at the end.

182
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,775
Who are you!?.

183
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:41,843
I thought that basically
what I had done

184
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,278
was I had taken
mom and apple pie,

185
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:49,882
and the clean, wonderful, let's
have a ball Pepsi generation,

186
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,919
these clean cut kids who are out
having fun

187
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,785
and unfettered
by adult restrictions,

188
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,288
and stood it on its head.

189
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:57,696
And I just knocked them off
one-by-one.

190
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,899
By the fall of 1 979,
with a script in hand

191
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:04,933
and a production budget of
approximately $550,000,

192
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,696
Cunningham and his protÈgÈ
Steve Miner

193
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,306
began searching
for the ideal location

194
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:14,110
that would become the cursed
hamlet of Crystal Lake.

195
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,747
The film was shot in a small
little Boy Scout camp

196
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,213
called 'Camp No-be-Bo-Sco.'

197
00:10:19,652 --> 00:10:21,119
It was off-season so all
the kids had gone home,

198
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,219
and we were able
to take it over.

199
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:26,284
So it was a standing,
working camp.

200
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,991
And, it was a whole bunch of
log cabins and all that stuff.

201
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:32,060
It was an archery range, it was
a lake, it was everything.

202
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,163
It was just a little bit colder

203
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,799
than it normally would be
in the summer.

204
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,832
Like most tales set at
summer camp,

205
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,129
"Friday the 1 3th" begins around
a campfire.

206
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,900
It's Friday, June 1 3, 1 958,

207
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,771
and lovelorn counselors
Claudette and Barry

208
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,038
soon find their late-night tryst
interrupted

209
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,181
by a murderous stranger,

210
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,783
making them the first
on-screen victims

211
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,351
in what would become
one of the biggest body counts

212
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:58,018
in film history.

213
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:01,124
Fans have often asked
if we planned to shoot

214
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,954
a more gruesome on-screen death
for the character of Claudette.

215
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:06,027
There are even photos that show
her throat being sliced open

216
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,733
by a machete.

217
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,629
I think it was Savini, you know,

218
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,859
fooling around
in the makeup room,

219
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,834
because we didn't have time
to shoot

220
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,133
that kind of a big production,

221
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,674
As I originally laid out the
character of the killer,

222
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:22,346
and the clues as to who
the killer was,

223
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,376
in the original scene,
you saw a missing finger.

224
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:30,050
And so that every time you saw
this hand without a finger,

225
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:31,347
that would be your clue
that this was the killer.

226
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,691
And for time
and budgetary constraints,

227
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,291
that got dropped out.

228
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:37,355
As the film shifts
to present day,

229
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,027
we are introduced to a cast
of fresh faces

230
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,291
culled from New York's
thriving theater scene.

231
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:45,203
And as would become the rule for
all future Fridays,

232
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,406
the young, would-be victims
had to be likable,

233
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,865
and they had to work cheap.

234
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,805
My partner at the time,
Julie Hughes and l,

235
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,980
were pretty much the major
casting people on Broadway.

236
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,183
But we had done a few films.

237
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,215
So we looked forward
to doing this,

238
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:05,151
particularly with the idea of
finding all sorts of new talent

239
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,916
for the young kids in the film.

240
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,958
Julie Hughes had said, 'You
know, you're not right for this,

241
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,132
but they're doing this movie,
and they need camp counselors,

242
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:15,765
and you would be perfect.'

243
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:18,026
So then they sent me
to meet Sean

244
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,794
and audition for
"Friday the 1 3th."

245
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,303
Hi, I'm going
to Camp Crystal Lake.

246
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,210
You have to figure out as
many different ways

247
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:29,904
of making the teenagers dumb
without being really stupid.

248
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,014
Uh, I think we better stop.

249
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,482
Because the audience
has got to be saying

250
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,889
as they sit there as part of
this roller coaster ride,

251
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,318
'Don't go in there, girl!
Don't go in there!

252
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,750
Oh, no!

253
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:44,861
To play their heroine,
the filmmakers required

254
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,962
a resourceful and intelligent
young actress

255
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:48,496
who could not only fight back

256
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,834
against the machete-wielding
killer,

257
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,005
but could also hold her own
against the amorous advances

258
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,140
of doomed camp owner,
Steve Christy.

259
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,036
Do I really look like that?.

260
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,802
You did last night.

261
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:05,415
My backstory to Alice was
she was an art student,

262
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:09,014
art major, psychology minor,

263
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:10,916
and she had gotten her job
through a friend of a friend

264
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,124
who knew Steve Christy.

265
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,189
Give me another chance.

266
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,155
He obviously had the hots
for her.

267
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,125
Alice was big on space,
you know?.

268
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,764
She needed lots of elbow room.
She had to think things out.

269
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,228
She was very confused.

270
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,958
I'll give it a week.

271
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,068
And who knows, maybe at
the end of the summer

272
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,329
something would have happened.

273
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:29,234
But he was gonna
have to be patient.

274
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,841
And he didn't seem like
the patient type.

275
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:35,877
Well, there's no crazy
people around here!

276
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,811
In the role of resident
prankster Ned was Mark Nelson,

277
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,076
who had recently starred
on Broadway

278
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,948
with his "Friday the 1 3th"
co-star Jeannine Taylor,

279
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,454
whose happy-go-lucky character
Marcie

280
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,918
was given a fitting
posthumous surname.

281
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,562
The character wasn't named
Marcie Cunningham.

282
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,226
She didn't really have
a last name at first,

283
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:57,401
and later on, after we wrapped,

284
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,398
Sean Cunningham decided,
I guess, to adopt me,

285
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:06,175
because I ended up
with his last name.

286
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,245
For the role of Bill,
the proverbial 'good guy'

287
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:11,813
who proves to be a contender
for Alice's affections

288
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,214
as well as a potential suspect,
the filmmakers cast the son

289
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:18,184
of one of Hollywood's
most beloved legends.

290
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:23,487
Harry Crosby was the son of the
legendary singer, Bing Crosby,

291
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:28,889
who was a popular singer
in the 30's, 40's, and 50's.

292
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,500
He had so many great stories
about his dad,

293
00:14:31,937 --> 00:14:34,098
who had just passed away,

294
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,275
so it was probably kind of
emotional for him

295
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,910
to share much about his father.

296
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:44,047
How can you guys eat that stuff?.
It looks like dead animals!

297
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:46,615
Playing the nurturing
and animal loving Brenda,

298
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,418
who learned just how dangerous
and deadly

299
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,886
an archery range could be,
was the late Laurie Bartram,

300
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:56,526
who sadly lost a long battle
with cancer in 2007.

301
00:14:56,962 --> 00:15:00,420
Laurie Bartram,
we miss her so dearly.

302
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:04,102
She was truly the heart and soul
on that production.

303
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:06,327
I remember her,
she was who you saw.

304
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,597
You know,
worried about everyone.

305
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:13,034
I was really shocked and upset
to hear she'd died so young.

306
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,509
Beautiful person,
inside and out.

307
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,508
But the young man whose fame

308
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:21,112
would far surpass
six degrees of Friday the 1 3th

309
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:24,220
was, at the time,
a struggling New York actor

310
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:26,390
whose biggest film role to date

311
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:30,925
had been in the blockbuster
1 978 comedy, "Animal House."

312
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:33,893
I was surrounded
by terrific young talent,

313
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,397
and particularly Kevin Bacon.

314
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:39,195
I just thought he was so good
and so professional.

315
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,668
I remember
when I called his agent

316
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,541
to see if l, if he would do
"Friday the 1 3th."

317
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:47,104
The agent said, 'Well, what does
he do in the film?. '

318
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,404
I said, 'Well, mostly he just,
you know,

319
00:15:48,647 --> 00:15:50,945
makes love to a lot of girls.'

320
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,447
And the agent said,
'Well, Kevin loves to do that.'

321
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:57,122
"Footloose" was his
breakout moment.

322
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:59,586
Let's DANCE!

323
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:01,322
And of course he skyrocketed,

324
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,393
but it was very obvious to me

325
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,191
that he was going to be a star.

326
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:11,198
One of the most memorable
characters in "Friday the 1 3th"

327
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,201
was Crystal Lake's resident
'prophet of doom,'

328
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,634
played by veteran actor
Walt Gorney,

329
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,543
who passed away in 2004.

330
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,674
I know a lot of the fans
of "Friday the 1 3th"

331
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:24,173
Iove and admire Crazy Ralph.

332
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,646
It's got a death curse!

333
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,520
And this sounds strange,
but it's the truth.

334
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:33,555
I thought that Walt Gorney
really was crazy.

335
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:38,987
He kind of frightened me.

336
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:43,258
And I realize now he might have
been a little eccentric,

337
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,697
but he was just a very, very
fine character actor.

338
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,971
It's so sad that he wasn't here

339
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,642
to share all this acclaim
over "Friday the 1 3th."

340
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:54,341
He would have would have
loved it.

341
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,276
As filming commenced
on September 4, 1 979,

342
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,484
cast and crew
experienced their share

343
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,709
of low-budget filmmaking
misfortunes.

344
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:04,622
And Cunningham's silent partner
Phil Scuderi

345
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:06,684
remained dissatisfied
with certain elements

346
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:07,990
of Victor Miller's script.

347
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:11,060
Enter Ron Kurz.

348
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:16,324
I was sent down there to do
some rewrites and basically

349
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:19,435
to also see what was going on.

350
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,640
I don't want to say I was a spy,
but (laughs)

351
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,372
The only scene
I had a problem with

352
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,477
was the inclusionary scene
of the motorcycle policeman,

353
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,476
which really argued against
the concept

354
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,512
that this was a geography

355
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,186
that was kind of off bounds
for the police.

356
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,286
I had never been
on a motorcycle before,

357
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:42,460
and in fact, I did fall on
my ass. (laughs)

358
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,128
The motorcycle fell on me,

359
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:50,802
and course, Sean and Steve Miner
come running to help me,

360
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,295
'You okay, Ron?. ' They lifted it
off me I says, 'I'm fine.

361
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,235
Although all of the human actors
who met their on-screen demise

362
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,306
came out of the film unscathed,

363
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:03,413
one on-screen fatality was,
in fact, very real.

364
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:07,745
I remember all of us
playing the scene,

365
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:11,520
and the poor snake,
it was a real snake.

366
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,055
And he was chopped into bits.

367
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:19,595
And for that,
on behalf of myself

368
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:21,424
and anyone
who's ever harmed a snake,

369
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,430
I would like to tell all snakes,

370
00:18:23,669 --> 00:18:27,696
poisonous or not, I'm sorry.

371
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,598
Wanting to up the ante on
Halloween's minimalist shocks,

372
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:34,836
Sean Cunningham
needed to find someone

373
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,111
who could create the realistic,
larger-than-life death sequences

374
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,340
called for in the script.

375
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:41,450
In the world of practical
special effects,

376
00:18:41,687 --> 00:18:44,383
a new Dawn was emerging.

377
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,716
When I decided to make
"Friday the 1 3th,"

378
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,593
my job was to try to figure out

379
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,819
how to make something scary
for very little money

380
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,629
and very little
production value.

381
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,094
The original
Friday the 1 3th came out

382
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,165
after "Dawn of the Dead."

383
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:01,532
And "Dawn of the Dead"
was sort of the first film

384
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:05,869
that put gore effects
really in the forefront.

385
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,608
Sean had seen
"Dawn of the Dead,

386
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:09,370
or somebody had seen "Dawn of
the Dead" and said,

387
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:10,172
'You know you're doing
"Friday the 1 3th,"

388
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:11,848
you gotta get this guy.

389
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:12,841
And there were other
make-up artists, you know,

390
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,344
but my effects
had a reputation

391
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,646
of being more realistic.
And that could be

392
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:19,755
because I was a combat
photographer in Vietnam.

393
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:22,854
If the stuff I created didn't
give me the same feeling I got

394
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:26,128
when I saw the real stuff,

395
00:19:26,365 --> 00:19:28,856
then the fake stuff wasn't good
enough, it wasn't real enough.

396
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,235
And I think that had a lot to do

397
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,802
with the reputation
for my effects.

398
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,400
Up comes this guy in a BMW,
and it's Tom Savini.

399
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,701
He comes in, he's got this
script all marked up,

400
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,605
and he said,
Okay now, let's see.

401
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,211
We've got a hunting arrow up
through the chest,

402
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,709
that's not a problem.

403
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,247
I've got an axe in the face
here on page 40.

404
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,578
Do you want a real face
and a fake axe,

405
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,912
or do you want a fake face
and real axe?. '

406
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,186
It's porno really, isn't it?.

407
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:53,823
So the money shot
in these slasher movies

408
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:59,788
is the big kill.

409
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:03,360
Sean was very insistent that we
borrow from Hitchcock,

410
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,594
that piece of "Psycho," which
was to surprise the audience

411
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,601
within the first twenty minutes

412
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,276
with, 'These people are not
screwing around!'

413
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:15,378
People have said to me
that my character was sort of

414
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,411
Iike the Janet Leigh
in "Psycho,"

415
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,446
because I'm, I'm the set-up.

416
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,744
You know?. I'm the set-up
character to follow.

417
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,182
Excuse me, how far is
Camp Crystal Lake from here?.

418
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:27,654
It is a lot of fun being
the first person killed

419
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,327
in 'present-day' time of
"Friday the 1 3th."

420
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,530
But I didn't last too long.

421
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,857
We did the little stunt,
jumping out of the jeep

422
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,198
and running through the woods,
and that was really,

423
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,902
that was really great fun.

424
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,202
You see her up against
the tree.

425
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:41,736
And the knife comes up
(makes a swish sound)

426
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,464
and passes through frame.

427
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,540
And she's standing there
for a second.

428
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,244
she puts her hand up,
and you're thinking,

429
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:48,468
'Oh, maybe she's okay.'

430
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,705
And then the blood pours out.

431
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:52,940
The piece was very small
that was on my neck.

432
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:55,615
So, there was already a slit
in the piece.

433
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:57,685
And it was covered very well.

434
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,483
So, the tube, you know,
just ran down my sleeve,

435
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,626
and Tom was right there
working the blood.

436
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:04,351
Just right off camera.
It really did look great.

437
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,962
The beauty of these movies

438
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,765
and kind of the slasher movie
genre ultimately is,

439
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,436
you can go and just, if you want
to go see people get killed

440
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,298
in a variety of interesting
and compelling ways,

441
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,836
you can go and have that.

442
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,264
If you want
a little bit of nudity,

443
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:18,476
chances are you're going to
get that as well.

444
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,971
And I know as a young man,
that's what I wanted.

445
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:20,571
I needed the T&A for me,

446
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,473
to hell with the audience.

447
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:24,375
You know, bikinis and
swimming, and it's all just

448
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,278
young and hormonal.

449
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,578
Everybody wants to have sex
with each other.

450
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:33,348
Oh my god! I actually took
my clothes off!

451
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,890
Yes, it was for a great reason.

452
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,626
I got to have 'screen sex'
with Kevin Bacon.

453
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,992
Then, when poor Neddy
is on top,

454
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,334
we don't actually
see him killed,

455
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,036
but I thought that
was so brilliant.

456
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:50,032
With the blood dripping down.
It's like AHHH.

457
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,841
There you have Kevin Bacon all
satiated and smoking dope,

458
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:56,309
and he gets an arrow
through his neck.

459
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:57,606
I thought that was so creative
and so brilliant.

460
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,840
Probably my favorite.

461
00:22:00,085 --> 00:22:03,680
But I had done
George Romero's Martin,

462
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,048
and in Martin the guy had to get
a stick in his neck.

463
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,787
And in Kevin Bacon's case,

464
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:09,425
we put that wife beater
on the fake body.

465
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,561
He's like on his knees
under the bed

466
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,389
with his head here,
and here's the fake body.

467
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,760
And me and my buddy, Taso,
under there and you know,

468
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:18,936
I'm pushing the arrow through
and Taso was pumping the blood.

469
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,736
But an accident occurred.

470
00:22:20,972 --> 00:22:23,770
The tube separated
from Taso's pump,

471
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,443
so he grabbed it and blew in it.

472
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,942
And that's what made the blood
shoot out and gurgle.

473
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,440
Which was a happy accident,
it made the effect,

474
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,878
you know, bloodier and grislier.

475
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,349
She screams and the axe
comes up.

476
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:39,853
And you see the axe make contact
with the light.

477
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:43,027
You know, that was completely
Tom's idea,

478
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:47,398
as to make the audience realize
that this axe is a real axe.

479
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,623
It has substance to it,
and it's heavy.

480
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:53,634
I don't remember precisely
what showed up on film,

481
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,672
but I do know that the scene
was a lot longer

482
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:03,006
than what ended up in
the final cut. No pun intended.

483
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,973
Sex is part of
the driving thing.

484
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,751
There is this war between
sex and violence that goes on.

485
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,718
Sex...die
You know, have sex, die.

486
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,552
That's the premise, that's
the underlying thing, you know,

487
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,056
going through
the "Friday the 1 3th" movies.

488
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:18,793
Is Sean Cunningham
like a devout,

489
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,827
born-again Christian
or something?.

490
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,125
I don't believe "Friday the
1 3th" was a morality play.

491
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,729
Alice had sensibilities,

492
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:28,963
and she was not part of
what I called the clique,

493
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,842
or the in-group or whatever.

494
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,877
The reason the girl
who didn't make love survived

495
00:23:36,114 --> 00:23:38,981
was that she was not distracted.

496
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,444
It's not that she was more moral
than the others,

497
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:43,779
she just had had nobody to
make it with

498
00:23:44,022 --> 00:23:46,013
so she was not busy.

499
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,551
I remember one particular one

500
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:49,852
where Adrienne
is in the kitchen.

501
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,495
And she thinks she's safe.

502
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,063
And there's a place
where she just goes, [sigh]

503
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,968
and just as that happens --

504
00:23:58,203 --> 00:24:00,899
WHAM! Somebody comes flying
through the window.

505
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:01,969
You didn't see
Laurie Bartram die,

506
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,469
the girl on the archery range?.

507
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,436
She was just thrown
through the window.

508
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:06,007
It was actually me

509
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,036
in her nightgown and wig,
going through the window.

510
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:09,572
But Cunningham's insistence

511
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:11,442
that he would not
give the audience any clues

512
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:14,083
that would hint at the killer's
real identity

513
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,613
resulted in "Friday the 1 3th's"
penultimate surprise.

514
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,483
Where is the killer?.
Who is the killer?.

515
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:22,124
And we bring in Betsy Palmer.

516
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,552
We cast Betsy Palmer.

517
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,993
And this was really my strong
feeling for Mrs. Voorhees,

518
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,861
that she should be somebody
warm and comforting.

519
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,127
So when that door opens,

520
00:24:33,572 --> 00:24:37,099
and the audience sees
it's this nice mother type.

521
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,136
I'm Mrs. Voorhees.
An old friend of the Christies.

522
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,206
And you would think of her
and be predisposed

523
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:43,841
to think of her as
a nice person,

524
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,812
who then we find out is crazy.

525
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:50,112
I had heard,
I think probably from Sean,

526
00:24:50,555 --> 00:24:52,682
that Estelle Parsons had been
offered the role first.

527
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:56,621
And because Estelle and l

528
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,887
are actresses of the same age
and all

529
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,530
Because "Friday the 1 3th's"
production schedule

530
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,132
got moved back,
she could no longer do it.

531
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:08,471
So it was strictly
a time thing.

532
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,470
It wasn't that she didn't like
it, or they didn't like her.

533
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:11,971
By the way, when l
read this script,

534
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,041
I said 'What a piece of junk'.

535
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,180
I thought,
'This will come. It will go.

536
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,709
Nobody will ever know
or ever see it'.

537
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:22,749
So I run into Mrs. Voorhees,

538
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:23,682
thinking she is the one
who is going to save me

539
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:26,584
I felt, 'Oh, this poor thing'

540
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,760
and she's telling me
about all this disastrous stuff

541
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,223
that was going on

542
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,858
They're all dead.
They're all dead.

543
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:37,728
And then we find out
that she had this kid

544
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,062
Did you know
that a young boy drowned?.

545
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,273
The year before those two others
were killed?.

546
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,006
Poor woman.
She lost her son, Jason,

547
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:48,769
while the camp counselors
were fooling around.

548
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:53,178
Jason was my son,
and today is his birthday.

549
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:56,849
And this becomes,
'Oh boy, look out now.

550
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,056
Now I get it.'

551
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,658
You let him drown!
You never paid any attention!

552
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,091
Look what you did to him.

553
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,856
In retrospect,
I think "Psycho" got in

554
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,068
in a way that I was not
conscious of at all.

555
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,635
Well, a boy's best friend
is his mother.

556
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:17,968
I basically reversed
Tony Perkins and his mother.

557
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:22,612
And I had the mother alive,
and the kid dead.

558
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,213
She's revenging
poor Jason's death.

559
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,881
And she believes
that it's our fault.

560
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,784
All of a sudden, I hear the
voice in my head saying

561
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,926
Kill her, Mommy! Kill her!

562
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:38,629
There's another place
where Betsy,

563
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:39,659
who's really
an incredible actress,

564
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:41,331
she did a thing,

565
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,960
and I even pointed it out
to her one day,

566
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,759
and when you say the line

567
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,129
He wasn't a very good swimmer.

568
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:48,566
And you smiled.

569
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,674
You're crazy, you know it,

570
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,674
and you don't care. (laughs)

571
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,972
And that's really scary.

572
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:01,015
I won't, Jason. I won't.

573
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:04,085
I came up with the idea
for Jason's name

574
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,586
'cause originally I had called
him, it was going to be Josh.

575
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,851
But the more I worked
on the film,

576
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,290
and the creepier the whole
subject of that got,

577
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:14,858
I stuck with the 'J'
and went to Jason.

578
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,591
And I knew a kid named Jason
when I was, oh,

579
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,360
about 8, 9 or 1 0 years old.

580
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,068
And he was one of them sneaky
little bastards,

581
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,172
who was always
telling on people.

582
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,036
And he was a mean little guy.

583
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:28,268
And so I never really
liked his name.

584
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:30,681
Despite having played arguably

585
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,177
one of the most
demented villainesses

586
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,941
ever to appear on screen,

587
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,278
Betsy Palmer
has amassed a large,

588
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,918
and largely-sympathetic,
cult following.

589
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,126
When I'm doing the autographs,
signing, conventions,

590
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,124
they put their babies in my arms

591
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:48,696
and this killer lady (laughs)
holds the little child.

592
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:51,094
The little children
come up and all.

593
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:54,794
I've said to people, I've said,
'Why?. Why do you love her

594
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,065
as much as you do,

595
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,776
when she's supposed to be
this dreadful human being?. '

596
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,308
And they say,
"Because we understand

597
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,407
why you did it."

598
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,214
Mrs. Voorhees, is,
to my thinking,

599
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:09,386
had every reason
to keep a camp closed

600
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,415
because otherwise
somebody else's son would drown

601
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,154
just like her little Jason.

602
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,917
And that's all she was doing,

603
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:19,323
was making sure that that
never happened to another mother

604
00:28:19,764 --> 00:28:21,288
ever again.

605
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,099
I've never felt that
she was anything

606
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:26,963
but a mother who was trying
to care for a poor,

607
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:29,366
wounded cub.

608
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,776
I mean I couldn't imagine.
I'd just go crazy, myself,

609
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,069
if my grandson,
who I'm raising as my son,

610
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:35,904
if something happened to him.

611
00:28:36,147 --> 00:28:39,708
So I can clearly identify
with Betsy Palmer's character.

612
00:28:39,951 --> 00:28:42,920
Here's a child who's been
ignored, neglected.

613
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:46,749
I honestly felt like, 'Hey,
here's one for all those kids

614
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:49,152
who have been set to the side
because they were different.

615
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:52,852
Many years ago, with the help of
a very fine psychologist,

616
00:28:53,098 --> 00:28:56,431
I saw that Mrs. Voorhees
is the mother I never had.

617
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,894
She is the mother
who will kill people

618
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:03,369
to avenge her son's death.

619
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:05,708
Undeniably, one of the film's
most memorable characters

620
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,174
is its iconic musical score.

621
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,313
and the now-infamous
sound effect

622
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,445
created by composer
Harry Manfredini.

623
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:16,718
So much of the delight
of "Friday the 1 3th"

624
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,217
and the experience of it,
came from the sound effects

625
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:19,946
and the music.

626
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,317
Somehow or the other, the music

627
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,456
had to evoke
and point out the fact

628
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:27,126
that the killer was there.

629
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,423
It wasn't
just the camera shooting.

630
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:30,960
it was the POV of the killer.

631
00:29:31,202 --> 00:29:34,194
Harry's delightful
signature piece,

632
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:38,375
the ma-ma-ma-ki-ki-ki...

633
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,107
If you go to the end
of the film,

634
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,314
you'll see a very close-up
of Betsy Palmer's,

635
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:46,176
Mrs. Voorhees' mouth.

636
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,851
Where she's saying, to herself--

637
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,384
kill her, Mommy.

638
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:55,418
Kill her, Mommy.
Kill her.

639
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,523
I just went, and I took the
consonant sound of the 'K',

640
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,331
'Kl' from kill her,
and 'MA' from 'Mommy.'

641
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:07,527
I went up to a microphone
and just went 'k-k-k-' 'ma'.

642
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,907
And we ran it through something
called an Echoplex,

643
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,771
which was a gizmo back
in the late 70's, early 80's.

644
00:30:15,013 --> 00:30:18,380
And it ended up becoming
'k-k-k-ma- ma-ma',

645
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,877
and that of course,
became the instant sound

646
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,315
that I needed
to bring the killer

647
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:30,927
into the first reel,
and throughout the picture.

648
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,062
And I'm sure that without
Harry's music,

649
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:34,890
and without the sound effects,

650
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,498
we never would have had
the success

651
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,266
that finally happened.

652
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,835
I think the women
were stronger in this film

653
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,437
than the guys were.

654
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,399
You know, look who
it came down to.

655
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,209
The battle was between
Mrs. Voorhees and Alice.

656
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:50,039
There was a sequence
that I was to,

657
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:53,216
well, I'd begun
to really lose it.

658
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:56,909
Smack her, you know, give her
a hit alongside of her chops.

659
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,554
Well, when we hit somebody
on stage,

660
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,355
we hit somebody.

661
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:04,289
So I hauled off,
and I gave her a smack.

662
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:08,124
Well, she fell
to the ground crying,

663
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:12,325
'Sean, Sean, she hit me.
She hit me.'

664
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,969
And he came over and he said,
'No, no, no, Betsy.

665
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,467
We don't do that in movies.'

666
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:19,172
I said, 'Well, what are we
supposed to do?. '

667
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,503
He said, 'You'll miss her.'

668
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:25,347
And he said, "We'll just bring
in the sound afterwards."

669
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:29,110
Alice doesn't want to die.
And she fights back.

670
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:33,620
And then they go through this
incredible beach ballet.

671
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,618
We're, of course,
pounding away at one another,

672
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,291
and I have her hair.

673
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:44,433
And then she goes at me
with some sort of a boat oar.

674
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:48,332
My favorite kill of all--
Mrs. Voorhees slow-mo.

675
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,633
It doesn't get better than that.
The ultimate kill by Alice.

676
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,239
The assistant director
came up, and said,

677
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,007
'Hey, we're gonna
cut your head off.'

678
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,878
He said, 'Don't ya wanna see
how we're gonna do it??'

679
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,486
I said,
'You've got to be kidding.

680
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,483
I could care less how you're
going to chop my head off'.

681
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,156
Taso Strevakis was my
assistant on that movie.

682
00:32:10,395 --> 00:32:12,420
We actually made a cast
of Betsy Palmer's head,

683
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:15,098
made a rubber dummy of it.

684
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,324
We decorated the inside so when
it severed you would see

685
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:20,162
anatomically-correct
gore in there.

686
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,465
It was Tommy Savini's assistant.

687
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,676
It was attached to him
in some way.

688
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,273
And Tommy Savini
is the one that cut it off.

689
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:31,448
What I did was I attached it
with toothpicks.

690
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,583
So the toothpicks were just
kind of holding it in place,

691
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,986
knowing that when I whacked
it with that machete,

692
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,152
it would go through
the toothpicks.

693
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,322
And I wanted to whack it
so the head would spin,

694
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:42,082
which luckily it did
in the first take.

695
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:44,921
Oh, I mean, I don't have hair
on the back of my hands,

696
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:46,425
you know, like he did.

697
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,189
I thought that was
a little weird in one shot.

698
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:51,698
If you watch the movie when
Betsy Palmer is decapitated,

699
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,262
her hands come up
into the frame,

700
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,098
in kind of like grabbing air.

701
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,933
They're Taso's hands
with hairy knuckles.

702
00:32:58,176 --> 00:33:00,644
It's not Betsy Palmer.

703
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:04,242
It's these big meat puffs
that he's got as hands.

704
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,211
Even after the dramatic
death of Mrs. Voorhees,

705
00:33:06,451 --> 00:33:09,215
a final, crucial scene remained.

706
00:33:09,454 --> 00:33:11,388
One that would prove to be
Cunningham's master stroke,

707
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:14,090
and a defining moment

708
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,622
that would, unbeknownst
to anyone at the time,

709
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,494
spawn a franchise.

710
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,392
You know, in talking to Sean
about the ending,

711
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:22,599
They really didn't
have an ending so,

712
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,729
and I had just seen Carrie.

713
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,397
You know in Carrie
they did a beautiful job.

714
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,400
Brian De Palma convinced you
the movie is over.

715
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,038
She's walking around
in the graveyard,

716
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:31,468
the hand comes up and grabs her.

717
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,506
Scared the bejesus out of me,

718
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,235
and I'm sure anyone else
who ever saw it.

719
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,277
So I said to Sean,

720
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,106
'Why don't we have Jason
jump out of the lake, you know,

721
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,112
and attack her?. '

722
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,581
But Jason's dead,' he said.

723
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,420
And I clearly remember that,
you know, if it's a dream,

724
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:46,145
you can get away with anything.

725
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,689
You could call it an homage,

726
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,561
I call it a theft.
You know, grand theft cinema.

727
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,196
I mean everybody, including
the special effects man

728
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:57,094
(laughs) to the girl
who typed up the memos,

729
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:58,734
to the girl
who went out for lunch,

730
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,037
claimed to have
written this scene (laughs).

731
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:03,433
But, I wrote it.

732
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,574
At first, they were thinking

733
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,610
of having Noel Cunningham,
Sean's son, do it.

734
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,278
But his wife
would have none of that.

735
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,542
My mother said,
'You're out of your mind

736
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,220
if I'm going to let my kid
spend four hours in a lake

737
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:18,786
in the middle of fall
in New Jersey

738
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,214
to be in your stupid movie.

739
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:24,019
Were it not for her,
I would have been Jason.

740
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:26,526
I would have been
the first Jason.

741
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:31,360
And I'm not bitter

742
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:33,763
Prior to that I had been
in "Manny's Orphans,"

743
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,730
and I played this kid Roger,

744
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:40,372
who was like a slightly
sex-obsessed little kid.

745
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:43,409
So Steve Miner
just kind of said,

746
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,546
'Hey, let's get Ari to do it.'

747
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:46,511
My investors in Boston

748
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,185
wanted to have it more
extreme and seaweed,

749
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,684
and maybe he could be deformed
a little bit,

750
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:55,058
and Tom Savini said,
'Oh, I've got a great idea.'

751
00:34:55,293 --> 00:34:56,624
And he started to make his head
lopsided

752
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,193
and put a weird eye on him.

753
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,091
And it just became
more and more extreme.

754
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:05,598
We dredged up
part of the pond

755
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:09,671
and Tom Savini
used real swamp muck for that.

756
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,269
I came upon a picture
in this group of Polaroids

757
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,375
and I said, 'And who's this??'

758
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:18,104
And he said,
'Oh, that's your son.'

759
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,613
And I said, 'Well, why does he
look so strange?. '

760
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:24,151
And he said, 'Well, he said,
he's a mongoloid.

761
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:27,357
I said, 'He's what?.!'

762
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,856
I said, that wasn't
in the script!'

763
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,694
That's a nightmare Jason
that comes out of the water.

764
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:37,261
The real Jason was probably just
an almost ordinary child.

765
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:40,835
And so that part
is a total dream,

766
00:35:41,272 --> 00:35:42,705
or it was in my mind.

767
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,735
We wind up having this gorgeous,
idyllic setting.

768
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:48,645
You know, on the lake,
in the canoe.

769
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,713
I did everything I could
to tell the audience

770
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,779
that it's okay now.
You can relax. It's over.

771
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:59,314
But the strongest aspect is
Harry Manfredini's soundtrack.

772
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:02,390
That was really the first
time in the film

773
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:05,790
where the music stopped being
the music for the killer

774
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:12,191
and started to really
manipulate you.

775
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:15,132
It's over. The police have come.
The cavalry's here.

776
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,206
It went on so long
that even the people

777
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,603
who were positive something
was going to happen

778
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,836
pretty much gave up that
something was going to happen.

779
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,613
Alice has this look of hope.

780
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,748
And she's just trailing her
fingers in the water.

781
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:31,349
And BAM!

782
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,853
And it was a wonderful addition.

783
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:35,759
I mean I think
that Sean's idea is right.

784
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,355
That it really wasn't finished
until that.

785
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,621
One of the really delightful
things that we could do

786
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,561
is go to a screening and watch
the people jump at the end,

787
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:47,362
because for whatever reasons,
this ending got 'em.

788
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:49,368
I'm telling you, people just
flew out of the seats

789
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,438
and ran out of the theater

790
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:53,769
and Sean was just like
a little kid going,

791
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,373
'l got 'em, I got 'em all!'

792
00:36:56,614 --> 00:36:58,514
I think without
that single moment,

793
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,182
I don't think Friday would have
been half as successful

794
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,477
as it was.

795
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,745
Because the people got to leave,
strangely enough,

796
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,251
with a smile on their face.

797
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,515
They got tricked,
and they loved it.

798
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,523
And then the next scene
Alice wakes up,

799
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,196
and they tell her
no one else was found.

800
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:16,957
It was only her.
Everyone else is dead.

801
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:21,269
I remember the scene
in the hospital vividly

802
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:23,803
because, when I sort of ask,

803
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,642
when she asks me
about the boy and I go,

804
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,868
Ma'am, we didn't find any boy.

805
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,577
And she says

806
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,443
Then he's still there.

807
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:36,676
And he certainly was.

808
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,584
I knew that we're looking
at a Part 2 here.

809
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,293
Those little drops at the end,

810
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,392
Those little ripples
in the water at the end.

811
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,495
It's like, well, was it a dream,
wasn't it at dream?.

812
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,290
Were those raindrops,
or were those air bubbles?.

813
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:52,331
And I think now
we know the answer.

814
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,004
In early 1 980,
the film was picked up

815
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,374
for domestic distribution
by Frank Mancuso, Sr.

816
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,669
VP of Paramount Pictures,
who planned a national release

817
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:03,880
and a multi-million dollar
marketing campaign.

818
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:06,783
The risk paid off,
and for Paramount,

819
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:09,350
Sean Cunningham
and Georgetown Productions,

820
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:10,679
"Friday the 1 3th"
was about to become

821
00:38:10,921 --> 00:38:13,389
their lucky day.

822
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,821
Frank Mancuso was head
of distribution at Paramount.

823
00:38:17,061 --> 00:38:19,757
And he had the idea
of treating this little movie

824
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:22,864
as if it were a real movie.

825
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,270
And had no stars,
and nothing recognizable

826
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,972
except this sort of strange,
superstitious title.

827
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:32,035
And went out
and sold it like crazy.

828
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,910
1

829
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:38,838
2

830
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,914
3

831
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:45,413
Friday the 1 3th.
You may only see it once.

832
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:50,719
But that will be enough.

833
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,953
"Friday the 1 3th"
opened on May 9, 1 980,

834
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:58,528
eventually taking in $39.7
million at the U.S. box office.

835
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,737
If the reason behind the film's
immense popularity

836
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,598
was lost
on mainstream critics,

837
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,434
who not only hated the film,
but eviscerated it.

838
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,736
no one was more stunned by its
success than its creators.

839
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:10,913
For better or worse,
"Friday the 1 3th"

840
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,782
would change their lives.

841
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,646
and the horror genre...forever.

842
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:18,616
When it first started,
it was repeat business

843
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:19,982
that made it successful.

844
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:23,587
It was teenage girls
going to see it

845
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,318
and then bringing
their girlfriends,

846
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:26,996
and then dragging
their boyfriend to see it.

847
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:28,955
It was all this repeat business.

848
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,028
Before "Friday the 1 3th,"
maybe the most successful

849
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,698
quote-unquote horror movies

850
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:36,338
were handled on a very
limited basis,

851
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,371
Iike "Halloween"
or even "Carrie."

852
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,941
They weren't treated
as major motion pictures.

853
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,371
The fact that that one
became so wildly successful,

854
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,742
the producers jumped on it
as this is an opportunity

855
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,714
for us to sell this off
and make more and more films.

856
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:52,616
You also have to remember
this was back in 1 980.

857
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:55,519
This was before cable TV.
Before the internet.

858
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,595
Before VHS really. Before DVD.

859
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:04,562
So if you wanted to get anything
that was really titillating,

860
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,566
horror was the only place
you could go.

861
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,898
There was something,
um, exciting about it

862
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:11,540
'cause it was breaking
new ground.

863
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,607
And of course your parents
didn't want you to see it,

864
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,005
which only made you want to
see it that much more,

865
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,005
and made it that much
better when you did see it.

866
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:21,612
The modern horror movie
was kind of born,

867
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:24,980
because it now became
a possible player

868
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,755
in the mainstream distribution
of movies.

869
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,653
It's like "Night of the
Living Dead" with Romero.

870
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:32,158
Those guys involved in that
all had careers after that.

871
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,791
I thought it was
a piece of crap.

872
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:38,160
And l, truthfully, didn't care
if my name got on it or not.

873
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:42,436
At that time. (laughs)
And then when it opened,

874
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,766
(laughs) My god!

875
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,704
The critical reaction
to "Friday the 13th,"

876
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,812
was so abysmal that I knew
we were going to be a success.

877
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:53,516
I mean, there was one critic
who wanted us all arrested

878
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:56,117
and tried for horrible crimes
against humanity.

879
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,579
I'm convinced it has
something to do

880
00:40:58,823 --> 00:40:59,790
with the growth of the women's
movement in America

881
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,889
in the last decade.

882
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,788
I think that these films are
some sort of primordial response

883
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,964
by some very sick people,
of men

884
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,757
saying 'get back
in your place, women.'

885
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,130
And I was upset by all of
the terrible publicity,

886
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,132
and the scorn
and the ridicule.

887
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:20,544
Gene Siskel gave us
this scathing review.

888
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:23,212
I think he even may have
published Betsy Palmer's address

889
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,638
saying, 'write to her
nasty things

890
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,578
because she's a terrible person.

891
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,447
How dare Betsy Palmer
play a role like this

892
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,623
in "Friday the 1 3th,"

893
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:36,122
when she has made herself
so lovable,

894
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,790
on "I've Got a Secret
all these years,

895
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:40,929
and all the television shows
she's done.

896
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,725
How dare she play a role
like that,

897
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,960
and insult her viewing audience?.

898
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:49,798
And I thought, 'Well,
those who can, do,

899
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,132
and those who can't, criticize.'

900
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:53,042
The first of the slashers

901
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:57,873
were to reflect the changing
attitudes and ideas

902
00:41:58,115 --> 00:41:59,946
about women
and what they could do.

903
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:03,153
I think we go back to Jamie Lee
Curtis in "Halloween,"

904
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:06,055
Sissy Spacek in "Carrie."

905
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,053
Sigourney Weaver.

906
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:10,920
Alice, all of a sudden,
is the sole survivor.

907
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,925
And I believe it was
a direct reflection

908
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:16,689
of what was going on
in the world.

909
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:20,927
And I think "Friday the 1 3th"
really empowered women.

910
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,139
So after "Friday the 1 3th"
was released,

911
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:26,509
there spawned
a whole new industry

912
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:30,180
of teenage horror films
based on holidays,

913
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,206
or based on a serial killer,

914
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:34,515
based on very low budgets
and low writing.

915
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:39,086
Strangely enough, I think that
people often sort of imitated

916
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:42,156
my mistakes rather than
the stuff that I got right.

917
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,891
Well, "Friday the 1 3th" was
the greatest experience for me

918
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:47,996
up until the point
of after it opening.

919
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:49,961
It was huge. It was fabulous.

920
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,065
It was an actor's dream
come true.

921
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:53,895
It certainly was for me.

922
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:58,040
And then, slowly I realized
I had a stalker.

923
00:42:58,275 --> 00:43:01,301
Stalking was not taken seriously
back in 1 980.

924
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:05,078
And it wasn't,
it wasn't something

925
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,284
that everyone was aware of.

926
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:10,186
I was starting to get
phone calls back then,

927
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:11,815
it was so easy
to get phone numbers.

928
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,819
He, he got into my apartment.

929
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:17,289
For over a year, I didn't know
who my stalker was

930
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,787
and what happened was,
he befriended me,

931
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,998
he actually worked his way
into my life

932
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:24,132
so I was actually
giving him information

933
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,996
about my stalker.

934
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:30,138
I had an ordeal with
him up close at one point,

935
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,638
which in itself,
is a horror movie.

936
00:43:32,876 --> 00:43:37,074
Eventually, I had a gun
to my head.

937
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:42,274
And I was able to talk
the fan down.

938
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,779
It really took its toll
for a while.

939
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,684
But, it's all okay now.
It's all good now.

940
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:50,291
And having three generations
of fans

941
00:43:50,728 --> 00:43:54,721
from around the world
that fly in to wherever I am,

942
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,159
at a city or a convention,

943
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,766
that really talk to me
and care,

944
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,061
and tell me how much
it affected them

945
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,828
when they found out.

946
00:44:02,072 --> 00:44:04,666
It's just a gift.
It's a beautiful thing.

947
00:44:04,908 --> 00:44:07,376
And, I thank them.

948
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,803
I've turned around
my thinking about it.

949
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,744
I think it worked out just
the way it was supposed to.

950
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,885
And I have never felt
that I damaged my career.

951
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:20,386
If anything, there are people
that would never know I existed.

952
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:24,055
We had this tiny little movie
that cost $500,000,

953
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:26,888
made in a boy scout camp
in New Jersey.

954
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:31,090
I (laughs) just cannot imagine
how we got here from there.

955
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,668
It kind of launched
the whole mythology.

956
00:44:34,905 --> 00:44:43,180
And it wasn't by accident,
but it was kind of good fortune.

957
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:56,651
And it wasn't by accident,
but it was kind of good fortune.

958
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:59,055
By the end of 1 980,
Friday the 1 3th

959
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,161
had already unleashed
a slew of imitators,

960
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:02,956
throwing open
the floodgates

961
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,861
for fledgling independent
distributors

962
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,093
and major Hollywood
studios

963
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:10,363
Iooking to cash in on
the new slasher film craze.

964
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:13,242
With each film seemingly
made faster,

965
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:15,445
cheaper and gorier
than the last.

966
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,370
With Paramount Pictures
pushing for a sequel,

967
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,875
Sean S. Cunningham grappled
with the question

968
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:23,313
of what to do when
virtually the entire cast

969
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:26,154
of your film
and its villain - are dead.

970
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,985
So, now this phenomenon
takes place,

971
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,990
and 'Friday the 1 3th'
opens around the world,

972
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,287
and it's a big hit.

973
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:34,959
And the powers that be said,

974
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,427
We have to make a sequel.

975
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:40,268
And I'm saying,
Why would you make a sequel?.

976
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,165
I didn't think there was
going to be any others

977
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,271
after the first one.

978
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,772
We were never led
to believe that.

979
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,272
Mrs. Voorhees is dead,

980
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,309
and the image of Jason
in the lake

981
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:54,741
is completely a fabrication
of the mind.

982
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,714
I don't know what in the world
we could do for a sequel.

983
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,819
Let me make one thing
totally clear:

984
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,887
at the beginning of my movie

985
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:04,185
Jason is dead.
There's no two ways about it.

986
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,454
Jason is totally,
unalterably dead.

987
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:09,957
They offer me Part 2,
and then I got the script,

988
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,134
and Jason is running around.

989
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,428
I thought, What are you doing?.
There is no Jason?.

990
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:15,770
You know,
the mother is the killer.

991
00:46:16,006 --> 00:46:17,166
Jason was the kid that
drowned in the lake.

992
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:18,806
Oh oh, we're going
to change all that.

993
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,875
Well, they never did.
So I chose something else.

994
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,340
I chose "The Burning,
which is sort of a rip off

995
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,112
of 'Friday the 13th."

996
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:27,078
I understand that it would
be very expensive

997
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:29,842
to bring Mrs. Voorhees
back to life,

998
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,281
especially after we cut off
her head.

999
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:33,353
So, we had to go somewhere,
and of course

1000
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,053
Jason was the most
logical place to go.

1001
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,760
Part 2 was basically
his journey

1002
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:41,226
of seeking revenge
of the death of his mother.

1003
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,832
And that's a very basic
foundation of storytelling.

1004
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:48,834
Legend has it that Jason saw
his mother beheaded that night.

1005
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,802
If you try to track that
on any kind of a timeline,

1006
00:46:52,042 --> 00:46:53,339
it makes no sense whatsoever.

1007
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:56,978
He just shows up some X number
of years later.

1008
00:46:57,214 --> 00:47:00,945
And I don't know
if I'd want to try

1009
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:02,277
to fill in the blanks
of what happened

1010
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:04,282
in between all those years.

1011
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:06,284
If you listen to the
old-timers in town,

1012
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:07,080
they'll tell you
he's still out there.

1013
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,792
He didn't drown in the lake.

1014
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:11,289
The mother thought
he drowned in the lake.

1015
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:13,120
So what happened to this child?.
He was young.

1016
00:47:13,363 --> 00:47:15,888
He kind of found
a way to survive,

1017
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:17,122
and he grew up
in the woods.

1018
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,096
Surviving any way he can.

1019
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,963
So what is he?.

1020
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,230
Is he living off crayfish
by the pond for 35 years

1021
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:24,872
and nobody saw this weird kid
out there, you know?.

1022
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:27,167
The first film
was obviously a thriller.

1023
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:29,174
It was, you know,
almost a murder mystery.

1024
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:32,143
Who's doing all this
killing and why?.

1025
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:35,840
Oh, my sweet, innocent Jason

1026
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:39,021
So the notion of having
a surprise

1027
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:41,156
as to who it is, or what it is,
changed completely.

1028
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:44,087
So, what the stories became

1029
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:47,229
was sort of a ritualized telling

1030
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:50,228
of a group of young people
who go someplace

1031
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,025
where they shouldn't go.

1032
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,032
You change the characters
a little bit,

1033
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:57,968
but it stayed inside
of a very deliberate form.

1034
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,176
While Cunningham
ultimately went on

1035
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:01,536
to pursue other projects,

1036
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:03,879
including "A Stranger
is Watching,"

1037
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:06,082
"Spring Break"
and "Deep Star Six,"

1038
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:09,114
his 29-year-old protÈgÈ,
Steve Miner,

1039
00:48:09,353 --> 00:48:11,184
was given his first feature
directing assignment

1040
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,889
on 'Friday the 1 3th, Part 2."

1041
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:16,888
Steve Miner
was definitely up for

1042
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:19,061
'Friday the 13th' Part 2,
for directing it.

1043
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,321
He and probably
with Sean's help, cast it.

1044
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,999
They found the location.

1045
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,896
They did all the preliminary
work on the show.

1046
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:30,106
And I know that he was involved
with some of the writing of it.

1047
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,570
Steve had been around all
of us for many years

1048
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:33,635
so thathe actually was so
young at the time,

1049
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,408
they called him 'The Kid'.

1050
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,511
That was his nickname.

1051
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,576
By the end of September 1 980,
a mere four months

1052
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:42,952
after the release
of the original film,

1053
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:44,915
Steve Miner and his crew
were already back in production

1054
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:47,248
with 'Friday the 1 3th Part 2.

1055
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,391
Code-named Jason.

1056
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:51,594
New to the team
was 22-year-old

1057
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,553
Frank Mancuso Jr.,

1058
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:55,624
who would become
the driving force

1059
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:59,331
behind the 'Friday the 1 3th'
franchise

1060
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:02,561
Frank Mancuso, Jr. called me up
before the show,

1061
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:04,439
and said that he was going
to come down

1062
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:05,937
and be a P.A. on the movie.

1063
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,404
I knew, of course, by this time

1064
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:09,544
his father was the president
of Paramount Pictures.

1065
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,916
I got involved in "Part 2" when
I was just graduating college.

1066
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,517
And my dad knew
the guys from Boston,

1067
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,683
Phil Scuderi and
Bob Barsamian,

1068
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,646
who sort of initiated
the first movie.

1069
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:23,355
He, you know,
went to work with us

1070
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:24,082
and was treated like a member
of the crew,

1071
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:25,920
became a member
of the crew.

1072
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:29,530
Those kinds of experiences
I really feel helped, you know,

1073
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,435
kind of form what I became
as far as having, you know,

1074
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:34,068
a keen understanding
of what everybody does,

1075
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:36,238
how they do it.

1076
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,202
And he was really just there
to learn, I think.

1077
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:41,138
And that's how it started.
He quickly caught on.

1078
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:43,573
And a couple of the people

1079
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:46,346
that were above the line
weren't working out

1080
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:47,675
so they were getting rid
of some of those people,

1081
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:49,483
so I kept on, like moving up
the food chain

1082
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,086
kind of strangely.

1083
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,517
And I think that that can only
happen on that kind of a movie.

1084
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:57,591
"Part 2" picks up two months
after the events of "Part 1,"

1085
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:01,088
with an extended prologue that
would see the return

1086
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:05,427
and the demise of the original
film's traumatized final girl.

1087
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:09,298
The fans have told me
at convention after convention

1088
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:13,373
that they felt, quote-unquote,
ripped off

1089
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:14,201
about the way Alice died
in "Part 2."

1090
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:16,412
I do, too.

1091
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,341
I mean she was such a tough
cookie in "Part 1,"

1092
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,573
and then (throat cutting sound).

1093
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,646
That was pretty much
a necessity.

1094
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:27,750
I think originally she had been
approached to star in "Part 2,"

1095
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,159
but her agent,
as I understand it,

1096
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,225
just wanted too much money.

1097
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:36,262
So, she was basically
written out.

1098
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,764
Honestly, when I got
on the set that weekend,

1099
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,726
I didn't know it was over
for Alice until I got there.

1100
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:42,729
So, surprise!

1101
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:44,697
They never gave me a script
for "Part 2."

1102
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:47,167
They said, 'Oh, it's just
gonna be improv.'

1103
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:48,309
I'm not kidding you.
This is how it happened.

1104
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,069
They, 'Slam-bam-thank you,
ma'am?. '

1105
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:51,473
Roll around
on the bed for a while.

1106
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,546
Intercut. Okay, go to the door,

1107
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:56,275
that whole phone conversation...

1108
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,681
I just have to put my life
back together,

1109
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:00,350
and this is the only way
I know how!

1110
00:51:00,590 --> 00:51:03,753
Not scripted. All improv.
All improv.

1111
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:06,594
After Alice's discovery

1112
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,060
of Mrs. Voorhees' decomposing
head in her refrigerator,

1113
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:11,267
she is confronted by the
vengeful, and fully-grown,

1114
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:13,230
Jason.

1115
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:14,664
I shot that scene
in one night.

1116
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,437
And it was a prop man I met,

1117
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:20,370
one who didn't check his props.

1118
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:23,306
And so the first time the
ice pick went into my temple,

1119
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,538
it did not retract.

1120
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:28,580
Yikes!

1121
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:30,616
After an explosive
main title sequence,

1122
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,049
the story jumps ahead
five years in time

1123
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:37,056
as another group
of unwary counselors

1124
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:38,625
arrives at Crystal Lake to open
a new summer camp

1125
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:41,831
headed by the enterprising
Paul Holt.

1126
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,789
I'm also sure there's one thing
I don't have to tell any of you.

1127
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:45,826
Being a counselor
isn't the gravy summer job

1128
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:48,134
everybody thinks it is.

1129
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,168
And I was a little older
than everybody

1130
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:51,567
because I was the head
camp counselor.

1131
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:53,605
He, you know, thought he was
somewhat older,

1132
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,368
and knew more than these people,

1133
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:59,241
he was a little prissy
and stuffy or something.

1134
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:00,472
You know I thought that would
be kind of a funny thing to do

1135
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:02,651
with the character.

1136
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:05,252
Assisting Paul is the spunky
and intelligent Ginny.

1137
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:08,856
Who would become one of the most
memorable

1138
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,850
and well-regarded characters in
the 'Friday the 1 3th' series.

1139
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,854
To know that I did
one of these films

1140
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,458
where they get all these
women in that are so vulnerable,

1141
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,100
and to be the one that people
think was strong

1142
00:52:19,336 --> 00:52:22,271
and intelligent,
it just, it feels good.

1143
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:26,101
There's always the last damsel
in distress

1144
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,641
who, you know,
summons up the courage

1145
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,506
to fight back.

1146
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:32,806
And then I guess with
my character,

1147
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,514
it was pretty great because
somebody who was strong enough

1148
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:37,549
to fight back and kind of
stay present

1149
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:39,721
in the face of danger.

1150
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:41,749
And I was so young
that I didn't create

1151
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:44,387
a whole other life

1152
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:45,720
'cause I think that
what was really called for

1153
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,893
was exactly who you were
as a person,

1154
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,697
to bring that to screen.

1155
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,561
Her character was
written for her,

1156
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:54,793
and it was written well.

1157
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:56,603
She was very, very well liked
on the crew as well.

1158
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,571
Amy slept with everybody
in the entire crew,

1159
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,835
the actors and most
of the people in Kent.

1160
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,679
I'm just kidding.

1161
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,143
Well, there's something
about the chemistry

1162
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,408
that we both have a very similar
sense of humor.

1163
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,711
It's a little bit sarcastic.

1164
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,922
(laughs) So we could look
at each other and kind of laugh.

1165
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,256
I think that's why
it might have worked.

1166
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:16,151
PAUL: Ginny, I was starting
to worry about you.

1167
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:17,826
GlNNY: Bullshit, Paul.'

1168
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:21,560
We actually stayed
in a camp

1169
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:26,565
that was no longer in use
because the season had passed.

1170
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:27,735
So we were in these
big barracks.

1171
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:29,700
I mean, it was insane.

1172
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,737
Basically, it was
a children's camp,

1173
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:33,237
and we wanted
to keep it that way.

1174
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,536
We didn't want anything
to stand between

1175
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,271
the good feelings that people
had about the children

1176
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:41,882
and a healthy environment,
which was a little bit different

1177
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,446
than the Jason environment.

1178
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:46,280
It was cold.
Everybody had heaters and stuff.

1179
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,582
And it was pretty basic.

1180
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:52,420
It was like living at night
for two months.

1181
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:55,187
You just start getting
kind of creeped out.

1182
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:57,593
You know, everything looks
so calm down here.

1183
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,699
I'm looking pretty closely,
I don't know,

1184
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:02,871
it would be amazing if all of a
sudden Jason just popped out.

1185
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:05,365
They weren't sure which role
they wanted me to play,

1186
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,476
so I wound up auditioning
but I think there was a point

1187
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:09,838
where Steve said,
'Hey Stu, tell a joke.'

1188
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,645
I did, I told a joke.

1189
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:13,314
They wound up,
in the movie, using jokes

1190
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,541
that I had invented like this

1191
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:16,274
TED: 'What's brown
and sits on a piano?. '

1192
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,248
VlCKlE: 'Your face.'

1193
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:21,389
TED: 'Beethoven's
last movement.'

1194
00:54:21,625 --> 00:54:23,991
There was a sign on the side
of the road

1195
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:25,485
in the beginning of the movie,

1196
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:28,892
but we do have that sign
as a remembrance

1197
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:30,993
of that particular scene.

1198
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:34,335
We come back to Crystal Lake to
open up this camp again,

1199
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:35,902
I thought all of us
would have been smart enough

1200
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:37,636
not to go back to a place
like that,

1201
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:39,899
but here we are going back
to a place

1202
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:41,833
where all these people
were murdered.

1203
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:42,973
The first night that we're
there and everybody's gathered,

1204
00:54:43,413 --> 00:54:46,348
and everybody's
made it to the camp,

1205
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,744
Paul Holt basically scares
the shit out of everybody.

1206
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:53,615
I don't want to scare anyone...

1207
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:56,519
but I'm gonna give it
to you straight about Jason.

1208
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,991
I had never been to a camp
in the country,

1209
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,661
so while he's doing
that monologue,

1210
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,959
Iittle Lauren-Marie Taylor is
thinking inside her head,

1211
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,963
Ahhh! -- For real.

1212
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:13,399
I thought that John did
a great job of, you know,

1213
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,975
kind of, in the scene,
of building the tension,

1214
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:18,779
you know, then to break with
Ted, you know,

1215
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:20,778
jumping out
and scaring everybody.

1216
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:24,509
[Ted howls and Group Screaming]

1217
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:25,413
And we just think it's going
to be a regular summer,

1218
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,646
the kids are going
to arrive.

1219
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:30,917
And then these horrible,
horrible things start happening.

1220
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:33,921
And one by one
Jason Voorhees kills us

1221
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:36,332
and continues to do
what he does best.

1222
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:38,830
With the departure
of gore wizard Tom Savini,

1223
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,765
another renowned Hollywood
special effects artist,

1224
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,734
the late Stan Winston,
was initially brought on

1225
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:45,770
to create the film's
bloody set pieces.

1226
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:49,445
Due to scheduling conflicts,
however,

1227
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,045
Winston was forced
to drop out of the project,

1228
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:55,315
handing his duties over
to up-and-coming

1229
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,076
special make-up effects
designer, Carl Fullerton.

1230
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,751
But a key casting decision
still needed to be made.

1231
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:05,359
Who would play murderous
mama's boy Jason Voorhees?.

1232
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:07,825
That question would,
like the character himself,

1233
00:56:08,064 --> 00:56:10,396
grow into the stuff of legend.

1234
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:12,692
They give me a black script.

1235
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:15,063
It said "Jason"
on the front of it.

1236
00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:18,099
'Well, we like you, you know,
for this counselor role.'

1237
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,476
I guess this was the role
that ultimately John Furey got.

1238
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:23,474
And so then they said, 'Well,
would you like to be Jason?. '

1239
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,773
Well, sure, yeah (laughs),

1240
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,483
I'd love to do anything
you want me to do.

1241
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:29,946
I could never figure out
the deal with Jason.

1242
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,480
They had a guy for a while.

1243
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:33,984
I believe his name
was Warrington.

1244
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:37,120
And then he didn't seem to like
doing it,

1245
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:39,824
or he didn't want to do
stunts or something.

1246
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,052
And then, he didn't stay
for the whole movie

1247
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:43,693
I got a call from
Cliff Cudney,

1248
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,025
who happened to be
the stunt coordinator

1249
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:46,901
on 'Friday the 1 3th 2,"

1250
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,934
and he had called me and said,

1251
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:51,037
'Listen, I'm up here
in Connecticut doing this film,

1252
00:56:51,474 --> 00:56:53,738
and the guy that they hired
to play Jason

1253
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:57,640
can't do his own stunts.
We got big problems.'

1254
00:56:57,881 --> 00:56:59,007
He says, 'Can you get up
to Kent, Connecticut?. '

1255
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,041
I know that the rest
of us on set,

1256
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:05,716
we knew that there was stuff
going on about Warrington

1257
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,786
and Steve and in terms
of who was doing what.

1258
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:09,491
If you had asked me
who was Jason,

1259
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:11,557
I would have said Warrington.

1260
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:13,456
Warrington Gillette
was my Jason Voorhees.

1261
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:16,631
He got all the hoopla,
you know,

1262
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,163
for everything that I did.

1263
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,000
Cliff Cudney, the stunt
coordinator, said to me,

1264
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,836
'You're the guy
that was the Jason.

1265
00:57:22,071 --> 00:57:24,505
Tell your story.
You did all the work.

1266
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:27,039
Ironically, neither actor
played Jason the first time

1267
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:28,808
the character appears on screen.

1268
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:30,945
For the film's moody opening,

1269
00:57:31,181 --> 00:57:33,046
Jason was played,
for the first and only time

1270
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:35,110
in the series' history
by a woman--

1271
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:37,645
costume designer Ellen Lutter.

1272
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,821
It also fell to Lutter
to come up with a disguise

1273
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,853
for the hideously-deformed
Jason.

1274
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:45,618
One that could only be called
a first step

1275
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:48,797
in the evolution of one of
horror's most iconic faces.

1276
00:57:49,032 --> 00:57:53,196
It was through Steve,
I remember him and Sean

1277
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,433
having these talks
up in Sean's office

1278
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,003
and coming up with designs

1279
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,801
for you know "Part 2"
with that canvas bag.

1280
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:04,502
Instead of using an ugly face
or an ugly mask for Jason,

1281
00:58:04,747 --> 00:58:06,510
he would just cover it
completely

1282
00:58:06,749 --> 00:58:09,513
in a sack or a bandage,
or whatever.

1283
00:58:09,752 --> 00:58:13,745
And everybody in the audience
would have their own images

1284
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,787
of what is the most horrible
person they can think of.

1285
00:58:16,025 --> 00:58:17,652
And it worked pretty well.

1286
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:19,885
The movie,
"The Town that Dreaded Sundown"

1287
00:58:20,129 --> 00:58:22,859
had a serial killer
wearing a potato sack,

1288
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,499
and so I think that could
have been, you know,

1289
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:28,465
an idea that was definitely
well utilized.

1290
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:29,933
The costume designer
was the one that brought us

1291
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,868
the pillowcase to cover Jason.

1292
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:33,473
I didn't like it at the time.

1293
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:35,143
But, I know why it was chosen.

1294
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:36,510
It was chosen because it was
an artifact

1295
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:38,646
that was readily available.

1296
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:40,975
That was the bridge
to the hockey mask,

1297
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:43,685
which became the icon,
and it was a great icon.

1298
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,821
Once I put the bag over my head,
and I ran in the woods,

1299
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:48,580
I couldn't see anything
'cause the bag flopped

1300
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:50,053
back and forth.

1301
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:52,693
We'll put double face tape,

1302
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:54,863
and we'll hold it
right close to your eye.

1303
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:55,928
This way you'll see
where you're going.

1304
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:59,134
And it worked marvelously.
It was terrific.

1305
00:58:59,569 --> 00:59:02,265
But to me, you know,
the real talent came in

1306
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,730
with Carl Fullerton
trying to create this face

1307
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:08,068
that was pretty pretty intense.

1308
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,211
And yeah, you would get in the
makeup chair at noon

1309
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,877
they'd be ready
to go at seven.

1310
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:15,277
So it's a process.

1311
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:18,278
Another notable character
from the first film

1312
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,246
would also meet an untimely and
early demise in "Part 2."

1313
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:24,888
I told the others.
They didn't believe me.

1314
00:59:25,128 --> 00:59:27,824
Walt Gorney was just there
for a very short time

1315
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:29,793
at the beginning
of the movie,

1316
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,967
and at the beginning
of our production.

1317
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:35,136
I'd say near,
between the American flag

1318
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:38,097
and that stop sign,

1319
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:39,706
that's where they had
the phone booth.

1320
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:43,003
And the actor came
riding through on a bicycle

1321
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,305
when they were in
the phone booth, and said,

1322
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,581
'You are all Doomed!'

1323
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:50,217
You're all doomed.

1324
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:52,848
Amazing guy.

1325
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:56,183
I remember Walt being sort of
quiet, but very, very nice.

1326
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:57,752
Veryand very,
very kind of elegant.

1327
00:59:57,994 --> 00:59:59,655
A really good actor.

1328
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:00,794
It was interesting,
when they did set up that booth

1329
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,191
in New Preston,

1330
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:06,227
they took a break for lunch, and
while they were eating lunch,

1331
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:08,728
two young girls came and they
tried to use the telephone.

1332
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:11,065
And of course,
it was a dummy phone,

1333
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:12,103
and everyone was just hysterical
watching them

1334
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:13,900
trying to use it
and coming out angry.

1335
01:00:14,143 --> 01:00:16,703
Crazy Ralph was choked.

1336
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,072
He was, I believe,
the first death

1337
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:19,713
in 'Friday the 1 3th' Part 2.

1338
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,179
Yeah, yeah, I killed Ralph
with a garrote and a thin wire

1339
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:26,077
and you take his head like that.

1340
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:27,880
What are you kids
doin' out here?.

1341
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:30,251
I'm proud to be known
as Deputy Winslow.

1342
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,287
In the original script,
I wasn't named.

1343
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,221
I was just kind of
an officer of the law.

1344
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:39,191
But in the book that followed,
I was given a name,

1345
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,900
and the name was Winslow.

1346
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:45,369
An interesting anecdote is that
I was hired as this cop.

1347
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:48,368
And I had to drive a police car.

1348
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,711
Now, I've never driven
a car in my life,

1349
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:53,347
before or since.

1350
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:57,184
And for a time they were
giving me some lessons,

1351
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,321
and I almost killed
more people than Jason.

1352
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:04,215
Now if you were a policeman,
and you were doing your job

1353
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:07,687
and you came driving down
the road here,

1354
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,660
and you saw a shape rush across
the road into the woods,

1355
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,063
you probably would do

1356
01:01:14,303 --> 01:01:16,237
what that policeman in
'Friday the 1 3th' Part 2 did.

1357
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:19,141
He pulled over, got out of
the car and ran into the woods,

1358
01:01:19,375 --> 01:01:21,639
chasing the figure.

1359
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:25,143
Unfortunately, the results
weren't so good to him.

1360
01:01:25,381 --> 01:01:27,872
In shooting that death scene,
Jason has this hammer.

1361
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:30,142
The claw end of the hammer

1362
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:32,320
went right in the back
of the cop's head.

1363
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:33,722
Before we started to shoot,

1364
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:37,392
I went to this make-up place

1365
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:39,795
and they made this exact
replica of me.

1366
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,054
And they put some blood bags
in there,

1367
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:44,391
and they were gonna smack me in
the head and (raspberry)

1368
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:45,766
everything was gonna
go like that,

1369
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,970
and they never used it.

1370
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,968
It intrigued me that we killed
Walt and the sheriff so early.

1371
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:54,699
And I think it was
just to remove any possibility

1372
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:57,879
that the cavalry would come over
the hill and save the campers.

1373
01:01:58,114 --> 01:02:00,207
So you knew that they were
in jeopardy,

1374
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,179
and that there was just
no turning back, or no help

1375
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:04,909
from the outside
going to come.

1376
01:02:05,154 --> 01:02:07,418
So there I was, sitting in this
fast food joint.

1377
01:02:07,857 --> 01:02:10,223
I think that Muffin was,

1378
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,291
I don't know if it was
someone's personal dog,

1379
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,698
or it was actually a trained
performing dog.

1380
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:17,456
It was very likable,
very friendly.

1381
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,300
I think it actually got
its name above my name

1382
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:21,704
in the credits.

1383
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:22,700
Do you want to dance?.

1384
01:02:22,939 --> 01:02:24,338
No, thank you.

1385
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:25,934
My character, you know,
was just striking out

1386
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:28,143
with women
and with the girl he was after.

1387
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:31,312
But the dog, she showed me a lot
of love in that movie.

1388
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:34,114
One of the cuts that I love
from 'Friday the 1 3th Part 2,"

1389
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:35,977
is the camera is on the dog
and all of a sudden

1390
01:02:36,219 --> 01:02:38,813
it cuts to hot dogs
on a barbeque grill.

1391
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:40,886
And it's just funny,
and Steve is like that.

1392
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:43,149
He has a sort of like a very wry
sense of humor.

1393
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:45,189
Well, I think that if Muffin
was still around,

1394
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:47,953
you know, we probably
would have stayed together

1395
01:02:48,197 --> 01:02:51,223
and but I don't want to get too
specific about that. (laughs)

1396
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:53,094
One of the actresses went
swimming in the nude,

1397
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:56,100
and of course that was a big
talk in the group,

1398
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:58,034
and everybody volunteered
to come there

1399
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,901
and help with the scene.

1400
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:02,168
They were looking
for a towel boy.

1401
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:04,174
Somebody who would wrap
towels around,

1402
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:06,472
I believe it was Kristen

1403
01:03:06,916 --> 01:03:08,247
who would come out of the water
in the nude,

1404
01:03:08,484 --> 01:03:10,509
and everybody volunteered.

1405
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,944
Looking for something?.

1406
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:15,817
I was so innocent. You know,
I don't know why I was killed.

1407
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:18,322
I don't know why Jason had it in
for me. It's crazy.

1408
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:19,994
My mother calls me
the night before and she goes,

1409
01:03:20,229 --> 01:03:21,355
'Do you die today
in the movie?. '

1410
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,459
I go, 'Yeah.'

1411
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,390
She goes, 'Why are they
save that to the very end?.

1412
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:26,927
Is this a snuff movie?.
Are they going to kill you??'

1413
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:27,795
I said, 'No, I don't
think so, mom.

1414
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:29,368
This is Paramount.'

1415
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,865
The snare was attached
to a sapling tree.

1416
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:35,043
And when he cut the rope
on the sapling tree,

1417
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:39,476
it pulled the rope up, which
would have the victim's foot

1418
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,144
in the rope and he'd be hanging
upside down.

1419
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:44,012
AAAAHHHHHHH!
AHH! HELP!

1420
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:47,188
In effect, it worked perfectly
and nobody was hurt.

1421
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:50,290
My head gets pulled back by
Jason, and he slits my throat.

1422
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:52,357
First they put the machete
against it,

1423
01:03:52,595 --> 01:03:54,085
and then he would pull it
and as he slit,

1424
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,888
it looked like he was
actually cutting it.

1425
01:03:56,132 --> 01:03:58,828
But they used the dull side of
the machete and many times

1426
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:00,365
people have said to me,
'lt looks like you were cut

1427
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:01,865
from the wrong side
of that machete.'

1428
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:03,571
And it's quite true.

1429
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:07,339
The role
of wheelchair-bound Mark

1430
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,204
was played by openly gay actor
and model Tom McBride,

1431
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:12,141
who sadly passed away in 1 995.

1432
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:14,508
I started flirting
with Tom McBride very early

1433
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:16,543
in the process.

1434
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:19,181
And he finally said,
'Lauren, not gonna happen.'

1435
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:21,014
And I went, 'Oh, shucks.'

1436
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:22,315
He's actually the only one
I flirted with,

1437
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:24,389
but Tom McBride was great.

1438
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:25,423
And he was just
a sweetheart.

1439
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,386
If you watch the movie,

1440
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,190
the most uncomfortable moment
I have

1441
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:32,560
is when I look at Tom McBride
in the wheelchair,

1442
01:04:33,002 --> 01:04:35,869
and I'm supposed to be
smoking a joint?.

1443
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:38,972
And I say...Toke?.

1444
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,334
You can tell I have no idea
what I'm talking about.

1445
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:43,477
And everyone on the set knew it.

1446
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:44,971
And they never let me forget it.

1447
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,148
I was such a good Catholic Girl.

1448
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:50,284
McBride's death scene in
'Friday the 1 3th Part 2"

1449
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:54,080
remains one of the series' most
memorable and controversial.

1450
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:57,156
I thought Tom McBride's
kill was cool.

1451
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:01,056
He got a machete in his head and
went down a series of steps.

1452
01:05:01,297 --> 01:05:03,197
It was just, seemed so cruel.

1453
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:05,627
You know, here's a guy
in a wheelchair,

1454
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,535
and you know he's got no way
to defend himself really.

1455
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:10,234
To me that's like,
how could you

1456
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:11,132
go much further than that?.
That's really far.

1457
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:14,070
Actually, he had
constructed a rail

1458
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,301
for the wheelchair
to travel on,

1459
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:18,945
and to make sure that the actor
wouldn't get hurt.

1460
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:20,910
It was a tremendous amount
of work put into it.

1461
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,243
It was a fantastic,
fantastic stunt

1462
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:24,976
back down that staircase.

1463
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:26,153
I don't know
if you've ever tried

1464
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:27,583
to go down backwards,
on a wheelchair,

1465
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,219
with a make-believe machete
in your head,

1466
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:34,088
but it's a challenge.

1467
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:36,525
Many of the film's
most inventive murder sequences

1468
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:39,366
were actually suggested
by the late Phil Scuderi,

1469
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,570
who never took credit for his
creative contributions

1470
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,596
to the 'Friday the 1 3th' films.

1471
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:46,372
Phil Scuderi was more,
I would say,

1472
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:49,305
Iike the architect
of the series.

1473
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:52,070
He came up with some great
scenes himself.

1474
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:54,283
I mean he, and it was
embarrassing sometimes,

1475
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:57,042
he'd get up in a restaurant
and act them out for me.

1476
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,378
You know, 'This is what I want
you to write,' you know,

1477
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,919
and he'd act a scene out for me.

1478
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:03,648
Of course there was a couple
in the bed having sex.

1479
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:05,060
And we all know
in a horror movie,

1480
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:06,386
if you have sex,
you have to die.

1481
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,460
Because it's wrong.

1482
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,393
Which is not the case
in real life.

1483
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,032
Oh, I thought it was great,
are you kidding?.

1484
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:13,599
You know, I remember
I was a young guy, you know.

1485
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:17,233
You'd be able to, you know,
film this, you know, love scene.

1486
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:20,203
And then, and then get a spear.
I thought it was terrific.

1487
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:21,467
Essentially, there's a hole in
the floor and both characters

1488
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:23,303
were standing in this hole.

1489
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:25,537
Carl Fullerton who was
our make-up guy,

1490
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,542
I had gone to his place
in New Jersey

1491
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:32,352
and they had made a latex back,

1492
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:34,453
which actually you never see
in the film.

1493
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,521
So he was actually
skewered on camera.

1494
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:37,953
That spear actually went into
his back on camera.

1495
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:39,957
It was fabulous.

1496
01:06:40,196 --> 01:06:41,288
It was just really fun.

1497
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:45,159
The sound guy at one point,

1498
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:47,028
I'm sitting there on my knees
and he comes over to me,

1499
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:49,237
and he says, he says,
How are you?. How you doin'?.

1500
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:52,600
Are you okay?.
I said, 'You know, yeah.

1501
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,737
I'm alright, you know my, you
know I'm a little uncomfortable.

1502
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,236
He said, Open your mouth.

1503
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:02,417
And he blows some powder
into my mouth.

1504
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:05,449
And I'm telling you, they could
have filmed it 1 5 times.

1505
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,122
I was having a great time
after that.

1506
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,587
Fullerton's human-shish-kebob

1507
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,153
was one of the many graphic
special effects

1508
01:07:12,395 --> 01:07:14,386
deemed too disturbing

1509
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,598
by the Motion Picture
Association of America.

1510
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,625
To date, the scene has
never been released

1511
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,763
in its uncut form.

1512
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:22,727
That skewering scene was
actually really fun to set up

1513
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:25,640
and really fun to shoot.

1514
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,270
And what a disappointment
that it all hit the floor.

1515
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:30,479
When we were prepping
"Day of the Dead,"

1516
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:33,511
Carl Fullerton said,
'Oh, do you guys want to see

1517
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:36,217
some of the gags
from 'Friday the 1 3th' Part 2?. '

1518
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:38,386
We're like, 'Yeah, of course.
That would be great.'

1519
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:41,556
Before it got butchered
by the ratings board,

1520
01:07:41,791 --> 01:07:44,589
the fact that
the guy's on top of her,

1521
01:07:44,827 --> 01:07:48,593
and she sees Jason coming,
and she's struggling

1522
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:51,391
and she's trying to push him
off of her

1523
01:07:51,634 --> 01:07:53,226
so she could get out of the way.

1524
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:57,064
It was such an effective,
disturbing sequence

1525
01:07:57,306 --> 01:08:00,503
that, to this day,
I could, I still remember

1526
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:03,211
exactly what it looked like.

1527
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:06,074
For all its gory inventiveness,

1528
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:07,748
the scene has been
widely accused of ripping off

1529
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:10,243
a nearly identical
murder sequence

1530
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:13,421
from Mario Bava's
1 971 Giallo thriller,

1531
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:15,715
"Twitch of the Death Nerve."

1532
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:17,557
It was kind of fun
after the fact

1533
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:20,626
to discover that Mario Bava
had made a film

1534
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,455
called "Twitch
of the Death Nerve,"

1535
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:25,064
which I had never heard of
and never seen

1536
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:26,791
until long after the fact.

1537
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:29,363
This is going to sound
really, really weird,

1538
01:08:29,605 --> 01:08:31,197
but I was a great screamer.

1539
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,465
I hope nobody takes that
the wrong way.

1540
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:37,338
But, I was. I could scream,
I mean -- (screams)

1541
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,377
I was really good at that,

1542
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,344
and I think once they figured
that out,

1543
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:44,109
they decided, 'Okay, we're gonna
have her scream a lot.'

1544
01:08:44,353 --> 01:08:46,253
So they made it really long.

1545
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:49,390
And it started with just that
little swipe on the leg.

1546
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,456
Where he, kind of, missed
whatever he wanted to cut off.

1547
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,491
But then he kept,
you know, it was like...

1548
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:54,753
(makes Psycho sound effect)

1549
01:08:55,197 --> 01:08:56,494
They didn't use a dummy for that

1550
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:58,290
when they dragged me
down the stairs.

1551
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:00,092
They actually dragged me
down the stairs!

1552
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:02,463
So when you saw my feet going
blump, blump, blump,

1553
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:05,173
that was a crew member
dragging me down the stairs.

1554
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,875
There was a scene later on,
where everybody's at the bar,

1555
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:10,141
and everybody's you know,

1556
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:11,539
partying while the rest of us
are getting killed.

1557
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,270
Ginny: What if there is a Jason?.

1558
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:16,110
Paul: Oh, bullshit, Ginny!

1559
01:09:16,352 --> 01:09:17,819
Ginny: I mean, let's try to
think beyond the legend

1560
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:19,778
and put it in real terms.

1561
01:09:20,222 --> 01:09:21,382
I mean,
what would he be like today?.

1562
01:09:21,624 --> 01:09:23,353
The character of Ginny Field,

1563
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:26,186
she somehow really understood

1564
01:09:26,428 --> 01:09:30,194
that there's more to a person
than just the bad side.

1565
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:33,128
You know, and everyone
wants to demonize somebody.

1566
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:37,237
And so, she had some kind of
insight that this,

1567
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:40,169
something had to go wrong
somewhere in his childhood

1568
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:41,706
or his upbringing.

1569
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:43,673
He must have seen his mother
get killed,

1570
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:45,312
and all just because
she loved him.

1571
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:48,312
I think Ginny kind of
understood that some,

1572
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:50,644
that there's more to it
than just this demon guy

1573
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:53,411
with a pillowcase over his head.

1574
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:56,147
We went to that bar
and none of those people,

1575
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:57,825
I think, had ever seen a movie,

1576
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,750
had been around a movie.

1577
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:01,322
And they were all hired
as extras.

1578
01:10:01,564 --> 01:10:03,327
And it was pretty funny.

1579
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:07,593
And we actually started
drinking a bit in that scene,

1580
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:09,394
so by the time
four in the morning came along,

1581
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:12,266
we just kept drinking.

1582
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:16,239
Arguably the luckiest character
is fun-loving prankster Ted,

1583
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:18,207
who decides to stay behind
at the bar,

1584
01:10:18,447 --> 01:10:20,915
thereby escaping certain death.

1585
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:25,218
I did another movie, a John
Carpenter film, "Christine,"

1586
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:26,614
and there's a scene in that
where I got killed.

1587
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:28,948
Where I got squished.

1588
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:30,915
And they originally filmed it
as me getting crushed

1589
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,884
underneath a car coming down.

1590
01:10:33,329 --> 01:10:35,729
In the movie they wound up
not using that scene.

1591
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:40,265
And I'm convinced that it's
because I don't die good.

1592
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:44,336
(laughs) So I'm glad that they
didn't try to kill me here,

1593
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:46,734
'cause, you know, to make
believe me dying as an actor,

1594
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:47,874
has got to be
one of the silliest things

1595
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:50,437
for a grown-up to do.

1596
01:10:50,679 --> 01:10:53,614
This is the site of the old
Lake Waramaug Casino,

1597
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:59,287
and this burned down
about a year after it was used

1598
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:02,581
for some scenes
in 'Friday the 1 3th Part 2."

1599
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:08,286
It starts to rain
and Amy Steel and John Furey

1600
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:09,588
are coming out of the bar.

1601
01:11:09,832 --> 01:11:11,424
And they're
about to get into their,

1602
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:12,929
her little red Volkswagen.

1603
01:11:13,369 --> 01:11:15,394
But I convinced Steve Miner

1604
01:11:15,638 --> 01:11:16,627
that I could run
through the scene

1605
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:18,499
in the parking lot.

1606
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,766
As they're getting in the car,

1607
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,877
you can see me
running into the restaurant.

1608
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:26,440
You can't even tell
that it's anything

1609
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:29,708
other than a body running
through the rain, but it's me.

1610
01:11:29,952 --> 01:11:33,353
I come back from the dead.

1611
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:36,786
Unaware of the carnage that
has occurred in the main cabin,

1612
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,688
Ginny and Paul
make a gruesome discovery,

1613
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:44,024
and the terrifying final
confrontation with Jason begins.

1614
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,730
When I'm down there waiting,
and they're coming in,

1615
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,027
and I'm behind the couch,
I was like a little kid.

1616
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:49,732
You know what I mean?.

1617
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:50,996
I was like, I couldn't wait,

1618
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,341
I was, oh,
this is gonna be good.

1619
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:57,010
Paul, there's someone
in this fuckin' room!

1620
01:11:57,446 --> 01:11:59,004
Amy with the screaming,
and the whole thing.

1621
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:03,748
And that's when
the chase scene started.

1622
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,317
There was a lot of physical
action in the film.

1623
01:12:05,554 --> 01:12:07,647
I had to jump out
of this window.

1624
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,017
And I remember the stunt guy
said you know,

1625
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:11,323
'Maybe you could get
a stunt adjustment for that.'

1626
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,391
But yeah, it was
a lot of running.

1627
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:14,891
Splashing through the puddles.

1628
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:18,562
Jumping, hiding,
a lot of it was hiding.

1629
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,496
I really like Amy,
I mean, I always liked Amy.

1630
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:22,897
She brought a great sort of
buoyancy to whatever she did.

1631
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:24,806
I mean, she came in,
she was enthusiastic,

1632
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:26,439
she was down with whatever
the program was.

1633
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:28,575
Here I am under the bed,

1634
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:32,042
and Jason's walking around,
and I'm scared to death,

1635
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:35,712
and all of a sudden a rat comes
right in front of my face.

1636
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:38,476
I thought Ginny was so scared
she peed her pants.

1637
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:40,689
Maybe it was the rat,
I don't know.

1638
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:40,945
But it wasn't a large amount
of pee for a rat?.

1639
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:45,690
I gotta give Amy Steel
a lot of credit

1640
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:47,919
because all during the filming
Amy never spoke to me.

1641
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,559
Off camera.

1642
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:52,357
I didn't have much
communication with him,

1643
01:12:52,601 --> 01:12:55,866
or I kind of kept him
very separate.

1644
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:59,097
Amy was non-existent.
She didn't want to come near me.

1645
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:00,530
She didn't want to know
anything about me.

1646
01:13:00,776 --> 01:13:02,710
I respected that.
I stayed away from her as well.

1647
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,936
But mostly, you know,

1648
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,871
they would shoot him
and then shoot me.

1649
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:09,516
So we were never exactly at
the same place at the same time,

1650
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:11,913
with the exception
of the sweater scene.

1651
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:17,023
That final scene we used to call
Chez Jason.

1652
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:21,418
Where Amy goes and dresses up
as Mrs. Voorhees.

1653
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:24,962
And Jason is somewhat
stunned by, wait a minute.

1654
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,698
This is my mom.

1655
01:13:26,935 --> 01:13:29,062
And she psyches him out.

1656
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:32,372
In her only cameo in any of
the 'Friday the 1 3th' sequels,

1657
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:35,475
Betsy Palmer appears to Jason

1658
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:38,771
as the ghostly visage
of Mrs. Voorhees.

1659
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:41,676
They said, would I come
and let them make up my head?.

1660
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:44,044
Again.

1661
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:47,580
And that they needed that
and do a few voice-overs.

1662
01:13:47,823 --> 01:13:49,620
And I said,
Sure, I'll do that.

1663
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:51,689
Which I did.

1664
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:54,725
He's a tragic figure because he
was looking for his mother.

1665
01:13:54,963 --> 01:13:56,521
Now here, after all this time,

1666
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:59,791
Amy's in the lair,
and she says

1667
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:01,935
Jason, mother is talking to you!

1668
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:05,766
Jason, Mother
is talking to you.

1669
01:14:06,008 --> 01:14:09,705
And when I listen
to what she said,

1670
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:11,879
that's when I did the,
you know, the tilt the head.

1671
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,809
Is that my mother?.
Is that my mother?.

1672
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:18,418
My heart broke. I really
felt bad for poor Jason.

1673
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:19,052
I felt what I was doing
through the whole thing,

1674
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:21,479
I really did.

1675
01:14:21,723 --> 01:14:22,815
That was the point
of the film where I went,

1676
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,083
'That's really
where we're going.

1677
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:27,188
That's what the sound
of this is.'

1678
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:31,497
So there was a certain
ethereal, sort of spacey,

1679
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:34,998
kind of sound that permeated
the picture from the beginning.

1680
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:36,966
I have the machete
behind my back.

1681
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:39,436
And I'm instructed
to pull the machete up.

1682
01:14:39,675 --> 01:14:43,167
And just as Mrs. Voorhees'
face is revealed,

1683
01:14:43,612 --> 01:14:46,046
he's supposed to bring up
this pickaxe.

1684
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,643
And then that's when I bring
the machete down.

1685
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:50,909
There was a lot of discussion
before that scene was shot.

1686
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,781
It was ultimately decided
that Amy could do it.

1687
01:14:54,022 --> 01:14:56,456
So Cliff took her,
and he walked her through it

1688
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:58,057
a couple of times,
on what would happen.

1689
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,792
'Make sure you hit the pickaxe
in the middle,

1690
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:02,758
and so forth, and so on.

1691
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,556
She is a great actress, but
unfortunately that day for me,

1692
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,824
she was trying to kill me.

1693
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:07,467
So I guess I got really anxious,

1694
01:15:07,703 --> 01:15:10,729
and I brought the machete down

1695
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:11,997
when he still had the pick-axe
like this,

1696
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:13,731
as opposed to this.

1697
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:17,742
She missed the pick-axe,
and she came down on my finger.

1698
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:21,245
And I felt so bad.

1699
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:24,652
But the actor who played Jason
was really cool about it.

1700
01:15:24,887 --> 01:15:27,515
You know, he just said,
'Hey, this is what happens.

1701
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:29,053
This is what happens when you're
a stunt person.'

1702
01:15:29,291 --> 01:15:31,259
So then he goes to the hospital.

1703
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:33,957
I think he had the machete
through his chest or something,

1704
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:35,561
and walks into the
emergency room and they're like,

1705
01:15:35,797 --> 01:15:37,765
Oh, my god!

1706
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,194
I come walking in
with the machete

1707
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:41,125
sticking out of my shoulder,

1708
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:42,559
and everybody
in the emergency room went...

1709
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:44,237
And I walked up to the desk,

1710
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:45,731
I says, Have you got anything
for a headache?.

1711
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:46,736
I've got a very bad headache.

1712
01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:48,772
They stitched him up.

1713
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:51,673
But, he was professional,
he came back,

1714
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:54,542
and they finished the scene with
the bandage under the shirt.

1715
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:58,719
And I have 13 stitches
in this finger to show you.

1716
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:00,649
It's right here,
this, it's 1 3 stitches.

1717
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:03,722
So, very apropos.

1718
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:06,086
Muffin comes tottering in.
(laughs)

1719
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:07,886
'Oh, Muffin. You're alive!'

1720
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:10,690
Come here, Muffin.

1721
01:16:10,933 --> 01:16:13,766
The scene where Jason comes
careening through the window?.

1722
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:16,027
Look, you thought
he was dead.

1723
01:16:16,271 --> 01:16:17,670
And it's the greatest shock.

1724
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,533
I know that the Jason
coming through the window

1725
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:20,935
was a nightmare for me.

1726
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:22,666
I had to do it three times.

1727
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,310
And it was really scary.

1728
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:25,770
And yeah, it's plenty scary.

1729
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,174
The mystery of the unknown.

1730
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,106
What is behind that
potato sack?.

1731
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:31,182
We never saw the make-up.

1732
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:32,314
And he didn't want me to see it.

1733
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:35,052
And he wanted to look
really real.

1734
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:37,224
You know, because we could have
walked up to the make-up area

1735
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:38,683
and seen what this guy
looked like

1736
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:40,554
so we wouldn't have been
as shocked, you know,

1737
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:42,286
when he blasts
through the window.

1738
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:46,326
They built a platform
outside the house.

1739
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:49,896
The platform was probably
4 feet long.

1740
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:52,834
So we coordinated how
many steps it takes.

1741
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:56,602
One, two three, bah, you know,
through the window.

1742
01:16:56,845 --> 01:16:58,642
And at this time in my life,

1743
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,939
I was not a well-seasoned
stuntman.

1744
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,913
So this was the first time
I jumped through a window.

1745
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:07,952
Steve was, he knew how I felt
about that scene.

1746
01:17:08,190 --> 01:17:11,023
And I remember he was,
you know he goes,

1747
01:17:11,259 --> 01:17:12,920
Hey, let's go have lunch.

1748
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:14,788
And he was trying to kind of
play it really cool

1749
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:16,895
and not let me know.

1750
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:18,997
And then all of a sudden
he said, Guess what?.

1751
01:17:19,234 --> 01:17:19,791
We have to re-shoot
that scene again.

1752
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:22,060
Ruined my day.

1753
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,363
But anyway, look, the proof
is in the scene.

1754
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:27,104
Cause we got it right,
and people are still talking.

1755
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:29,139
Much like its predecessor,

1756
01:17:29,378 --> 01:17:31,312
Part 2's ending would ultimately
pose more questions

1757
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:32,975
than it answered.

1758
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:36,184
Chief among them,
what happened to Paul?.

1759
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:38,613
The end of
'Friday the 1 3th Part 2"

1760
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:39,786
is still one of the most
confusing endings

1761
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:42,115
of that series.

1762
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:44,689
You didn't know what happened
to my character.

1763
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:45,790
Like she says
at the end of the movie,

1764
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:47,996
she says, "Where's Paul?. "

1765
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,891
And they said, "We don't know.
We haven't found him yet."

1766
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:52,066
So they purposely
left it ambiguous.

1767
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,791
And I'm not sure exactly
what did happen to Paul.

1768
01:17:55,037 --> 01:17:56,868
Too bad he didn't come back
in Part 3. (laughs)

1769
01:17:57,105 --> 01:17:59,266
As noted, we've seen a dog
that earlier in the film

1770
01:17:59,708 --> 01:18:02,176
it's suggested has been killed,
shows up again.

1771
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:04,743
There is, of course,
some speculation

1772
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,277
that it's a dream ultimately.

1773
01:18:06,715 --> 01:18:08,080
Maybe that's one of
the good parts of the movie

1774
01:18:08,316 --> 01:18:10,648
is that you get to decide that
for yourself.

1775
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:12,854
I guess there was talk
of an alternate ending.

1776
01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:13,986
It was not anything
that was prominent

1777
01:18:14,222 --> 01:18:15,814
when we were shooting it.

1778
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:20,654
At the very end, they zoom in
on Mrs. Voorhees' head.

1779
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:22,056
It was just sort of
sitting there on the altar.

1780
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:23,958
I know when they were
shooting it,

1781
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:25,791
I think they couldn't decide

1782
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:28,025
whether the eyes
should open or not.

1783
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:31,137
I think that they did
make her eyes go open.

1784
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:33,341
Although the alternate ending
of 'Friday the 13th Part 2"

1785
01:18:33,775 --> 01:18:35,675
remains unreleased,

1786
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:38,209
production stills have surfaced
of actress Connie Hogan,

1787
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:40,847
who played the decapitated head
of Mrs. Voorhees

1788
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:43,278
in the film's unused final shot.

1789
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:44,708
In my world that was never
a serious contender

1790
01:18:44,953 --> 01:18:46,921
for an alternative ending.

1791
01:18:47,155 --> 01:18:49,851
And we spent a lot of time
getting it right.

1792
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:51,184
And we did.
It's a fabulous ending.

1793
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:53,360
One of the guys came to me,

1794
01:18:53,795 --> 01:18:55,387
I was from the camp office.
And he said, "Thanks a lot.

1795
01:18:55,831 --> 01:18:59,733
We left you a Thank You
down at the lake."

1796
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:03,734
I came down there
and what I found was a head

1797
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:06,372
hanging from a tree
in a little net basket.

1798
01:19:06,808 --> 01:19:10,209
And, I guess
that was my thank you

1799
01:19:10,445 --> 01:19:12,436
for the courtesies extended
to these guys and the cast

1800
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:15,873
who were down there.

1801
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:16,243
So I still have that head and
I've had a lot of fun with it

1802
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:17,452
over the years.

1803
01:19:17,886 --> 01:19:19,717
As a matter of fact,

1804
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:21,047
I've had a number of people
who wanted

1805
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:23,951
to purchase that
and the Crystal Lake sign,

1806
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:29,755
but they bring back too many
happy memories to me.

1807
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:31,260
Paramount Pictures released
"Friday the 1 3th Part 2"

1808
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,025
on April 30, 1 981.

1809
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:36,260
Continuing the original film's
winning ad campaign

1810
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:38,939
highlighting the escalating
body count,

1811
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:41,768
PART 2 brought in a final
domestic box office take

1812
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:45,502
of $21.7 million.

1813
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:48,040
Even if the sequel didn't
achieve the monster success

1814
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:50,114
of the original,

1815
01:19:50,352 --> 01:19:52,252
it was still a bona fide
moneymaker.

1816
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:53,977
If nothing more, it proved
there was much more lifeblood

1817
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:58,386
to be drained
from Jason Voorhees.

1818
01:19:58,827 --> 01:20:00,226
The film came out,
and it was amazingly successful.

1819
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:02,054
We were all very proud of it.

1820
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:03,787
We made it
on a very small budget

1821
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:05,795
and pretty adverse
circumstances.

1822
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:07,262
You know, somebody from
Paramount called me up one day

1823
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:09,333
and they said, 'You're starring

1824
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:10,902
in the number one box office
movie in America.'

1825
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:13,437
You know, it sort of
sinks in then.

1826
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:15,809
And I'm glad that it's an
iconic kind of horror movie.

1827
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:18,012
I was shocked.

1828
01:20:18,246 --> 01:20:19,941
I had no idea that there was
such a fan base

1829
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:21,479
for this film,and for Ginny.

1830
01:20:21,917 --> 01:20:26,115
And everyone I've met
has been excited

1831
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:29,812
and just been nothing
but gracious.

1832
01:20:30,058 --> 01:20:31,286
When I got involved in
the second 'Friday the 1 3th'

1833
01:20:31,526 --> 01:20:33,050
I had never seen the first one,

1834
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:34,785
so I didn't know
what I was getting into.

1835
01:20:35,030 --> 01:20:37,191
And I very quickly had to sort
of get up to speed,

1836
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:39,195
and I had to very quickly sort
of had to assimilate myself

1837
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:43,029
into a place that I hadn't been
because of the opportunity,

1838
01:20:43,271 --> 01:20:45,364
and the faith that people had
in me, that they gave me,

1839
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:47,438
it turned out to be a, you know,

1840
01:20:47,876 --> 01:20:51,141
Iike a life changing sort of
dynamic for me.

1841
01:20:51,379 --> 01:20:52,903
We were actually shooting
the end of the movie,

1842
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:54,410
and Frank comes up and says,

1843
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:55,509
'Can I talk to you
for a minute?. '

1844
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:57,043
and I said, 'Sure.'
So he said,

1845
01:20:57,285 --> 01:20:59,845
'l have two job offers
when this film is over.

1846
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:02,056
One is I can be
Robert Evans' assistant.

1847
01:21:02,290 --> 01:21:03,484
He's doing a film
for Paramount.

1848
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:07,088
Or, I can produce my own film.

1849
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,854
Which do you think
I should do??'

1850
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:12,225
And I said, 'You know, I think
you should do your own film.

1851
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:13,991
I think that that would be
great for you.

1852
01:21:14,236 --> 01:21:16,136
I think you're ready
to do that.'

1853
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:17,565
And I was just really thrilled
that he asked.

1854
01:21:18,006 --> 01:21:19,439
And I had no idea
what he was talking about.

1855
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,036
And it turned out to be
Friday the 1 3th Part 3.

1856
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:24,211
And off he went.

1857
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:26,414
And he did a great job
with the series.

1858
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:29,139
I had no idea it was going to
work the way it did.

1859
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,147
In fact I really thought

1860
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:33,581
it wasn't going to work
the way it did.

1861
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:43,899
And I'm delighted
to have been so wrong.

1862
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:53,240
And I'm delighted
to have been so wrong.

1863
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:56,069
Bolstered by the success
of 'Part 2.'

1864
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:59,474
'Friday the 13th' managed to
survive its sophomore slump.

1865
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:03,009
A third installment
seemed a foregone conclusion.

1866
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,151
This time, however,

1867
01:22:05,387 --> 01:22:08,049
the previous film's
surviving character

1868
01:22:08,290 --> 01:22:10,451
would not return to face Jason.

1869
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:13,183
'Part 3' was going to have
me as a trauma patient

1870
01:22:13,428 --> 01:22:15,157
in a mental hospital

1871
01:22:15,397 --> 01:22:19,629
and that Jason was going to come
to find me

1872
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:24,129
and now his focus of revenge
was all on me.

1873
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:27,535
And then he started offing
all the patients,

1874
01:22:27,976 --> 01:22:29,967
and they were going to call it
'Friday the 1 3th

1875
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:32,076
Meets Cuckoo's Nest."

1876
01:22:32,314 --> 01:22:35,249
I was offered to write "Part 3"
but I turned it down.

1877
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:37,542
I didn't want to be pigeon-holed

1878
01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:41,251
as 'Friday the 1 3th' guy.

1879
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:44,219
I said no because I thought
I was going to go on

1880
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,484
to all these like other things,
and I didn't have time.

1881
01:22:46,728 --> 01:22:48,958
But in hindsight I should have
just done it

1882
01:22:49,197 --> 01:22:51,062
and had a great time.

1883
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:54,029
Once again, Steve Miner returned
to the director's chair

1884
01:22:54,269 --> 01:22:56,362
while script supervisor
Martin Kitrosser,

1885
01:22:56,604 --> 01:22:57,593
along with his wife
Carol Watson,

1886
01:22:58,039 --> 01:22:59,506
wrote the screenplay.

1887
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:02,301
This time,
the Boston-based investors

1888
01:23:02,544 --> 01:23:05,274
put the film into the hands
of a young,

1889
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:07,174
but extremely capable,
new producer.

1890
01:23:07,415 --> 01:23:08,507
These guys in Boston were
used to working

1891
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,217
with people that they knew,

1892
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:12,147
Iike they knew Steve Miner
from the first movie.

1893
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:14,378
He was a PA. Then
the second movie he directed.

1894
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:16,146
He directed the third movie.

1895
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:17,449
So they liked sort of
hanging onto people.

1896
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:20,354
Despite receiving a serviceable
first draft

1897
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:21,653
from Kitrosser and Watson,

1898
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:24,588
the producers ultimately
decided that the script

1899
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:26,159
needed more work before
the project could be green lit

1900
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:27,732
for production.

1901
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:29,261
I was friendly with
Frank Mancuso,

1902
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:31,028
and he mentioned
that they had the screenplay

1903
01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:32,967
in a series of horror movies,

1904
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:34,573
it was called
'Friday the 1 3th.'

1905
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,307
It's not a bad script,
but it has to be re-written.

1906
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:38,205
It has to have a different kind
of atmosphere.

1907
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:39,674
It has to be
a lot more sinister,

1908
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:41,673
a lot more menacing.

1909
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:43,106
In addition to injecting
the screenplay

1910
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:45,216
with more horror and menace,

1911
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:46,420
Steve Miner felt that 'Part 3'
could benefit

1912
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:48,144
from the revival of a gimmick

1913
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:50,654
that he hoped would draw
audiences back into theaters.

1914
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:53,686
And one that would make
it possible for Jason

1915
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:56,563
to literally
jump off the screen.

1916
01:23:56,798 --> 01:24:01,531
'Friday the 1 3th Part 3'
would be shot in 3D.

1917
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:05,137
Back in the early 80s,
Frank Mancuso, Sr. and l

1918
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:08,069
sat in an office in Toronto

1919
01:24:08,309 --> 01:24:12,712
and discussed the idea
of really trying to do

1920
01:24:13,148 --> 01:24:15,139
something radically new in film

1921
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:16,350
that would help the theaters out
a great deal.

1922
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:18,449
And what kind of a movie
should we make?.

1923
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:21,177
Should we do something like
"Star Trek 3D"

1924
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:23,152
which is what was
originally discussed,

1925
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:26,189
or should we try to do
something that's horror

1926
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:29,363
and to try to really break
the ground in horror films?.

1927
01:24:29,597 --> 01:24:31,326
We spoke a lot about
the horror films

1928
01:24:31,566 --> 01:24:34,433
that came out in the 50s in 3D.

1929
01:24:34,669 --> 01:24:37,160
I had not seen many 3D movies,
maybe one or two only.

1930
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:40,306
He took me to a 3D screening of
"Dial M for Murder"

1931
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:43,272
which was he, Steve Miner
was a fan of that movie,

1932
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:44,603
and a fan of Hitchcock
in general.

1933
01:24:44,846 --> 01:24:48,441
Frank Mancuso, Jr.
really saw the idea

1934
01:24:48,683 --> 01:24:50,480
of what the potential was.

1935
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:52,276
That whole idea
of going to a theater,

1936
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,818
putting these kind of goofy
glasses on.

1937
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:56,655
You want to have that fun
and so, you know,

1938
01:24:57,092 --> 01:25:00,289
that was part of the charm,
I think.

1939
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:03,361
To help defray costs associated
with the new 3D technology,

1940
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:05,293
the production team moved
to the west coast.

1941
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:08,127
and by the spring of 1 982,

1942
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,633
the search was underway for yet
another resourceful

1943
01:25:10,872 --> 01:25:13,340
female survivor
and a youthful cast

1944
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:14,803
of soon-to-be victims.

1945
01:25:15,243 --> 01:25:18,269
I sat in on the casting,

1946
01:25:18,513 --> 01:25:22,540
and I was surprised
how different my ideas

1947
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,251
of who should be the girl were

1948
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:29,150
compared to who was selected
by Steve Miner.

1949
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:31,290
Well, I had done a film called
"Sweet Sixteen,"

1950
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:33,357
and I guess
the producer/director

1951
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:37,622
saw me in that,

1952
01:25:37,866 --> 01:25:41,563
And I went for an audition and
basically met with Steve Miner

1953
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:44,271
and that was it.

1954
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:46,497
I didn't really have to do a
whole lot of auditioning for it.

1955
01:25:46,741 --> 01:25:47,765
There was a group of us.
There was the jock,

1956
01:25:48,209 --> 01:25:49,574
and the good-looking girl,

1957
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:51,403
and the nerd
and his good-looking date...

1958
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:52,510
I don't think so.

1959
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:54,578
And the stoners.

1960
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:57,250
They didn't really tell us much
on the interview.

1961
01:25:57,485 --> 01:26:00,113
It was very secret. There
wasn't a lot talked about.

1962
01:26:00,355 --> 01:26:03,188
My mother was an agent
at the time,

1963
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:04,789
and I was getting ready
to go to college.

1964
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:06,750
I had been working as a child
as an actress,

1965
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:08,628
and it was time to go
to college,

1966
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:10,353
and I was excited about that.

1967
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:12,498
My mom called my agent and said,

1968
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:14,565
"There's an interview
for a movie of some sort.

1969
01:26:14,802 --> 01:26:17,168
Crystal Japan.

1970
01:26:17,405 --> 01:26:20,738
But when we finally found out
what it was,

1971
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,736
oh, it was so exciting.
It was wonderful.

1972
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:26,704
Actor Larry Zerner was literally
approached on the street

1973
01:26:26,948 --> 01:26:28,279
by the film's screenwriters,

1974
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:30,211
who thought he was perfect
for the role

1975
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:32,385
of the overweight,
insecure prankster.

1976
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:34,645
Andy: Relax. Be yourself.

1977
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:37,517
Shelly: Would you be yourself
if you looked like this?.

1978
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:42,389
Shelly was unattractive
and heavy,

1979
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:44,791
and he just had very poor
self- esteem

1980
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:47,633
so he thought that if he had
these little tricks,

1981
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:49,200
that would bring attention
to him,

1982
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:51,735
which would make people
like him.

1983
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:53,873
Shelly: I guess
I fooled you, huh?.

1984
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:55,537
He's a little misguided
that way.

1985
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:57,802
Vera: Why do you do
these stupid things?.

1986
01:26:58,246 --> 01:26:59,372
Shelly: I just want you
to like me.

1987
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:00,911
I think given Vera's character,

1988
01:27:01,349 --> 01:27:03,214
she did see the good in him,

1989
01:27:03,451 --> 01:27:05,612
despite the fact that
she was supposed to be a babe.

1990
01:27:05,853 --> 01:27:08,754
And I talk to people
who go, you know,

1991
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:10,924
I really love Shelly or I love
the character and I love you.

1992
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:12,883
And then I do talk to a certain
amount of people who go--

1993
01:27:13,328 --> 01:27:14,454
Hated Shelly.
Worst character in the series.

1994
01:27:14,696 --> 01:27:18,564
After the dilemma

1995
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,792
of finding a capable stuntman
in "Part 2,"

1996
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:23,795
the filmmakers decided they
needed someone more agile,

1997
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,538
more athletic and more powerful
to play the savage killer.

1998
01:27:27,775 --> 01:27:30,471
I was actually working
as a stuntman in LA.

1999
01:27:30,712 --> 01:27:32,737
My background
is actually circus.

2000
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:34,278
I spent most of my life
as a flying trapeze artist

2001
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:35,982
in the circus.

2002
01:27:36,417 --> 01:27:38,442
He looked like the boogeyman.

2003
01:27:38,686 --> 01:27:41,484
He looked creepy and scary

2004
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:44,624
in the way that Richard Brooker
had him moving.

2005
01:27:44,859 --> 01:27:46,850
There's a certain
malevolent intelligence

2006
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:50,355
to the character in 3 that's not
seen in the other movies per se.

2007
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:52,862
I didn't get any direction from
Steve Miner at all actually.

2008
01:27:53,301 --> 01:27:55,997
He actually came to me and said,
you know,

2009
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:57,961
"Don't ever come to me and ask
me what your motivation is

2010
01:27:58,406 --> 01:28:00,306
because you have no motivation.

2011
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:01,838
You're just a mindless killer,
and you just go out and kill.

2012
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,541
You're like the living
version of "Jaws."

2013
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:07,339
The creative choice
that Steve Miner made

2014
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:11,450
to keep Jason
lurking and unseen,

2015
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:13,779
I think was just a masterful
creative choice

2016
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:17,549
that added to the suspense.

2017
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:20,260
Steve knew that it was better
to try to keep Jason

2018
01:28:20,495 --> 01:28:22,656
kind of in the background
as a shadowy figure

2019
01:28:22,897 --> 01:28:25,957
as opposed to, you know,

2020
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:29,302
just turning around
and having Jason stand there.

2021
01:28:29,537 --> 01:28:31,437
And he kept that going
throughout the whole movie

2022
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:33,971
so you really didn't know
or see, you know,

2023
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:37,037
how big Jason was until right
at the climax of the movie.

2024
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:39,946
Steve Miner was a very
laid-back director,

2025
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:41,780
and there was not
a lot of tension on the set

2026
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:44,348
so it was easy to work with him.

2027
01:28:44,585 --> 01:28:46,644
I had worked in the business
since I was 2 years old,

2028
01:28:46,888 --> 01:28:48,515
and I had worked
with a lot of directors.

2029
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:51,384
And a lot of in my mind,
directors were grown-ups

2030
01:28:51,626 --> 01:28:53,059
and Steve was another kid.

2031
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:55,655
Never difficult.
Never hard on us.

2032
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:58,730
Just a nice guy.

2033
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:00,957
In an homage
to his idol Alfred Hitchcock,

2034
01:29:01,402 --> 01:29:04,337
Steve Miner appears
in an early cameo

2035
01:29:04,572 --> 01:29:07,439
playing the newscaster reporting
on the grisly aftermath

2036
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:08,664
of "Part 2."

2037
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:11,037
Crystal Lake
was shocked today

2038
01:29:11,479 --> 01:29:12,776
with reports of a grisly,
mass-murder scene.

2039
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:14,641
Naturally, the ominous warning
goes unheeded

2040
01:29:14,882 --> 01:29:17,908
by Jason's
next batch of victims.

2041
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:21,948
I have warned thee!

2042
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:23,948
You know, a lot of kids don't
listen to the news, you know?.

2043
01:29:24,392 --> 01:29:25,916
They got better things to do
with their life.

2044
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:28,488
So I think it's understandable
that all of us would be,

2045
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:30,425
you know, heading up
to Crystal Lake

2046
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:31,962
to be with our friends.

2047
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,766
The day after
the events in "Part 2,"

2048
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:36,435
so it's technically
Saturday the 1 4th,

2049
01:29:36,671 --> 01:29:38,070
but don't tell anyone.

2050
01:29:38,506 --> 01:29:40,474
It was filmed at a ranch
in Saugus, California.

2051
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:43,506
They actually built
the set there

2052
01:29:43,745 --> 01:29:44,837
so everything
was in one location.

2053
01:29:45,079 --> 01:29:47,547
They built a little lake.

2054
01:29:47,782 --> 01:29:49,579
They built the barn.

2055
01:29:49,817 --> 01:29:51,614
They built the house and so
everything was done right there.

2056
01:29:51,853 --> 01:29:53,650
Shooting was put off
for a day or so

2057
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:57,984
because there was an infestation
of bees around.

2058
01:29:58,426 --> 01:30:02,362
So there were
rattlesnakes everywhere

2059
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:04,565
and some of the guys,
some of the grips had guns

2060
01:30:04,799 --> 01:30:06,061
and then they'd hear
this gun going off

2061
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:08,526
because they were shooting
rattlesnakes.

2062
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:12,706
Here we are on the set of
"Friday the 1 3th Part 3,"

2063
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,737
In 3D.

2064
01:30:14,976 --> 01:30:18,503
Over here's the house
that we used,

2065
01:30:18,746 --> 01:30:21,044
that unfortunately burned
about a year ago,

2066
01:30:21,482 --> 01:30:22,779
but the fireplace
is still there.

2067
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:26,077
But this house was built
just for us.

2068
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:28,455
It was a great atmosphere.

2069
01:30:28,689 --> 01:30:31,749
Our producer was young.
Our director was young.

2070
01:30:31,993 --> 01:30:34,427
The whole cast
were a bunch of young kids.

2071
01:30:34,662 --> 01:30:37,597
And it was a very relaxed
atmosphere.

2072
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:39,527
Everyone having a good time,
and everyone having fun.

2073
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:42,827
Well, it was also the first
movie with the 3D camera,

2074
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:44,970
which was kind of exciting.

2075
01:30:45,206 --> 01:30:46,867
I mean, it was a very
unusual camera.

2076
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:48,973
This was the lens that was used

2077
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:52,611
to shoot "Friday the 1 3th
Part 3 in 3D."

2078
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:54,906
As you can see, it's really
light weight and handheld,

2079
01:30:55,149 --> 01:30:57,549
and it permitted you to really
make a horror movie

2080
01:30:57,785 --> 01:31:00,049
the way other horror movies
are made.

2081
01:31:00,488 --> 01:31:01,921
We could do things like shoot
long lenses with it.

2082
01:31:02,156 --> 01:31:04,124
We could do rack focuses
with it.

2083
01:31:04,559 --> 01:31:07,653
Steve Miner did wonderful work
with Gerry Fiel

2084
01:31:07,895 --> 01:31:09,157
by shooting a whole picture
on a moving Louma crane.

2085
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:11,656
The first feature film

2086
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:16,029
to utilize the all-new
Marks 3D system,

2087
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:18,564
"Friday the 1 3th Part 3"
encountered more than its share

2088
01:31:18,806 --> 01:31:20,171
of technical mishaps
along the way.

2089
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:24,510
The 3D was very difficult.

2090
01:31:24,745 --> 01:31:27,009
It was a brand new process.
No one had ever used it before.

2091
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:29,045
Today 3D, I'm sure,
has come much farther

2092
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:31,748
and is a lot easier to shoot.

2093
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:35,444
Back then it would take hours
to set up a shot.

2094
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:37,783
There was a lot of time
to just, as an actor,

2095
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:38,992
to just sit around and wait.

2096
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:42,025
That's what we did mostly.

2097
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:44,754
And there was always
something going wrong with it.

2098
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:46,159
We were using at the time,
which was very new,

2099
01:31:46,601 --> 01:31:48,694
a Louma crane.

2100
01:31:48,936 --> 01:31:51,632
And in the first run they did
down the track,

2101
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:53,170
it collapsed.

2102
01:31:53,608 --> 01:31:55,166
The whole thing went over.

2103
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:57,601
So, you know, they had to start
all over again.

2104
01:31:57,845 --> 01:31:59,813
And I remember
the guy who ran it,

2105
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:01,878
he showed up one day
with a shirt that said,

2106
01:32:02,116 --> 01:32:03,777
"l Hate the Louma."

2107
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:05,849
The first thing we shot
was the scene at the store,

2108
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:08,681
and they ended up
basically throwing that away

2109
01:32:08,923 --> 01:32:10,857
because it was really
just a test

2110
01:32:11,092 --> 01:32:14,152
to see if it could be done
and then they revised it,

2111
01:32:14,595 --> 01:32:16,187
and we came back a week later
and then we did it.

2112
01:32:16,631 --> 01:32:18,792
You had to do it exactly
the way you were directed,

2113
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:20,830
or the 3D effect
wouldn't turn out.

2114
01:32:21,068 --> 01:32:23,195
So it was very precise.

2115
01:32:23,638 --> 01:32:26,163
Often times we would do
additional takes

2116
01:32:26,607 --> 01:32:28,199
just because
there were technical issues.

2117
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:30,668
So as an actor
that was a little frustrating.

2118
01:32:30,912 --> 01:32:32,903
When we're doing takes,
you know,

2119
01:32:33,147 --> 01:32:34,637
I'm throwing the wallet at
the camera in the store just

2120
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:37,282
it's just take after take

2121
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:39,515
because you have to hit
right to the camera

2122
01:32:39,754 --> 01:32:41,187
otherwise it doesn't work.

2123
01:32:41,622 --> 01:32:44,591
So things did take
more takes than usual

2124
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:47,760
because I had to be perfectly
right into the camera.

2125
01:32:47,995 --> 01:32:50,225
You weren't really worried so
much about your acting skills

2126
01:32:50,665 --> 01:32:52,565
as much as could you get
that yo-yo

2127
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,597
to go right in the lens.

2128
01:32:54,835 --> 01:32:56,598
That was more important
than anything else.

2129
01:32:56,837 --> 01:32:58,566
Director Steve Miner
focused on creating

2130
01:32:58,806 --> 01:33:00,296
a totally new look for Jason

2131
01:33:00,741 --> 01:33:02,766
and a host of gory
practical effects

2132
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:05,877
that needed to leap out
at the audience in 3D.

2133
01:33:06,113 --> 01:33:08,104
Some of the good 3D gags,

2134
01:33:08,349 --> 01:33:09,748
he puts a knitting needle
through a woman's mouth

2135
01:33:09,984 --> 01:33:13,943
so it comes out the front.

2136
01:33:14,188 --> 01:33:16,019
When it comes out her mouth,

2137
01:33:16,257 --> 01:33:19,158
it's actually a plastic version
of the knitting needle

2138
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:21,858
connected to the original one,

2139
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:22,687
and it's actually behind
Richard's hand.

2140
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:25,763
She just has her mouth open,

2141
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:26,694
and it's being fed
down the side of his hand

2142
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:29,232
and out through his fingers.

2143
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:30,694
It's definitely a movie
that should be seen in 3D.

2144
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:34,032
If you watch it on DVD,

2145
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:37,267
itjust a lot of the stuff
just doesn't work.

2146
01:33:37,712 --> 01:33:39,873
When you watch it on 3D,
it's like a whole other movie.

2147
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:41,274
People who see it
in a good 3D projection

2148
01:33:41,716 --> 01:33:45,049
do say
it is one of their favorites.

2149
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:47,345
"Part 3" had me at the credits.

2150
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:50,621
When those credits came out
part way and the whole music,

2151
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:51,882
the whole disco thing,

2152
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:55,721
and then they came out further,
was so cool.

2153
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:58,932
The creative force behind the
film's now famous disco theme

2154
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:01,794
was renowned music producer
Michael Zager,

2155
01:34:02,036 --> 01:34:03,663
who shared credit
with a fictional band

2156
01:34:03,904 --> 01:34:05,872
that he named "Hot lce."

2157
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:07,836
I'm not sure if disco was dead,

2158
01:34:08,075 --> 01:34:11,169
but it was certainly
it was still around.

2159
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:13,880
Disco really never
goes away anyway.

2160
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:16,106
Once you hear it,
you start to move,

2161
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:19,877
you feel you feel the groove,
I guess, you know.

2162
01:34:20,121 --> 01:34:21,986
I had no idea that this would
become such a huge

2163
01:34:22,223 --> 01:34:24,623
and popular thing.

2164
01:34:24,859 --> 01:34:27,293
For example, in all the discos,
gay clubs.

2165
01:34:27,728 --> 01:34:30,663
I understand there's actually
a tribute band

2166
01:34:30,898 --> 01:34:40,796
who plays that particular piece
live which astounds me.

2167
01:34:41,042 --> 01:34:43,101
People just come to me and like,

2168
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:44,834
"l just really love that tune."

2169
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:46,137
Get yourself
a little drum machine

2170
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,041
and you're on your way.

2171
01:34:48,282 --> 01:34:50,648
You, too, can be Hot lce.

2172
01:34:50,885 --> 01:34:52,409
In one of the film's
more memorable scenes,

2173
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:55,185
Shelly and Vera
are accosted at a general store

2174
01:34:55,423 --> 01:34:59,826
by a fearsome
motorcycle-riding trio.

2175
01:35:00,061 --> 01:35:02,962
Hey, we're back in the store
where we filmed the scene

2176
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:04,789
in "Friday the 1 3th Part 3."

2177
01:35:05,032 --> 01:35:06,795
This is
the Spunky Canyon Market.

2178
01:35:07,034 --> 01:35:09,901
It is located in Green Valley,
California.

2179
01:35:10,137 --> 01:35:12,367
This is the scene where we go
to the store to buy stuff,

2180
01:35:12,807 --> 01:35:15,298
and Vera goes to talk to
the cash register girl,

2181
01:35:15,743 --> 01:35:18,303
and she says that famous line

2182
01:35:18,746 --> 01:35:21,715
We don't accept no food stamps.

2183
01:35:21,949 --> 01:35:24,713
The other two members of
the gang, Fox and Ali,

2184
01:35:24,952 --> 01:35:27,284
played by Gloria Charles
and Nick Savage,

2185
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:31,089
were great and I think that,
very much like myself,

2186
01:35:31,325 --> 01:35:35,091
I don't think that that
was their natural role.

2187
01:35:35,329 --> 01:35:36,990
Then they throw
the condom thing in.

2188
01:35:37,231 --> 01:35:39,028
Is this your rubber?.

2189
01:35:39,266 --> 01:35:42,861
I was more embarrassed
than the character,

2190
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,095
the other character
was supposed to be

2191
01:35:45,339 --> 01:35:46,966
about someone talking
about a condom.

2192
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:49,938
Right behind me iswas where
the motorcycles were.

2193
01:35:50,177 --> 01:35:51,906
There's that scene
where the car backs up

2194
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:54,239
and one time I did
hit the motorcycle on accident,

2195
01:35:54,482 --> 01:35:56,313
and they were not happy with me.

2196
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:57,979
One of the first things we shot

2197
01:35:58,219 --> 01:35:59,345
when we started shooting
the movie

2198
01:35:59,787 --> 01:36:01,084
was the sequence
in the Volkswagen

2199
01:36:01,322 --> 01:36:05,190
and somebody smashes
the Volkswagen window out,

2200
01:36:05,426 --> 01:36:08,156
and Larry Zerner
looks to the camera and said

2201
01:36:08,395 --> 01:36:10,124
You went too far this time.

2202
01:36:10,364 --> 01:36:12,764
Shelly gets us out of there

2203
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,935
and I think shared experiences,
you know,

2204
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:17,296
Iike that bring people together.

2205
01:36:17,538 --> 01:36:19,096
Shelly: I did it! Did I do it?.

2206
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:21,274
Vera: Yes, you did it.
You were great!

2207
01:36:21,509 --> 01:36:23,272
So there was a scene
that was in the original script

2208
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:25,172
that we never shot

2209
01:36:25,412 --> 01:36:27,903
where the Volkswagen
headed down that road

2210
01:36:28,149 --> 01:36:29,116
and then the motorcycle gang
got on the motorcycles

2211
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:31,215
and chased us down.

2212
01:36:31,452 --> 01:36:34,114
And Shelly
had a champagne bottle

2213
01:36:34,355 --> 01:36:35,481
that he bought at the store,

2214
01:36:35,923 --> 01:36:37,185
and what he did is
he popped the cork

2215
01:36:37,424 --> 01:36:39,221
into their face

2216
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:41,394
which caused the motorcycle
to fly off

2217
01:36:41,829 --> 01:36:43,353
and them to be able to get away.

2218
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:44,457
And it would have been
a whole lot of fun

2219
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:46,526
but we never shot it.

2220
01:36:46,967 --> 01:36:48,298
And I don't know why.

2221
01:36:48,536 --> 01:36:51,232
One of my favorite shots
in the movie

2222
01:36:51,472 --> 01:36:54,873
is when we're going to siphon
the gas out of the van

2223
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:57,873
and that great shot
of Tracie Savage

2224
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,273
that goes basically
from her behind to me.

2225
01:37:00,514 --> 01:37:03,210
[BARKS LlKE A DOG]

2226
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:05,077
I love the idea
of siphoning gas

2227
01:37:05,319 --> 01:37:06,911
with a lit cigarette.

2228
01:37:07,154 --> 01:37:09,520
It's amazing.
The barn's still here.

2229
01:37:09,957 --> 01:37:13,825
Right above is actually where
my little body

2230
01:37:14,061 --> 01:37:16,325
was swinging back and forth.

2231
01:37:16,564 --> 01:37:19,533
The swinging part
was the scariest part for me

2232
01:37:19,967 --> 01:37:21,832
because they had this harness
on me inside my pants

2233
01:37:22,069 --> 01:37:24,367
that were way too tight.

2234
01:37:24,605 --> 01:37:26,800
I was absolutely
afraid of heights.

2235
01:37:27,041 --> 01:37:28,941
And I took this
as an opportunity

2236
01:37:29,176 --> 01:37:31,576
for me to just face that fear
and say

2237
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:34,344
This feels good!

2238
01:37:34,582 --> 01:37:40,851
Inside is where I so
stupidly walked in.

2239
01:37:41,088 --> 01:37:44,546
Amazing. That's where
I was pitchforked.

2240
01:37:44,992 --> 01:37:47,961
The stunt coordinator had
hooked her up on a wire support

2241
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:51,130
to the rafters
so she was already in position.

2242
01:37:51,365 --> 01:37:54,198
The fork was actually
a real pitchfork

2243
01:37:54,435 --> 01:37:57,893
but had the two prongs
in the center were collapsible,

2244
01:37:58,138 --> 01:38:00,902
and the hard part
was for me to not giggle

2245
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:03,974
while I was hanging there.

2246
01:38:04,211 --> 01:38:07,977
Same thing for the one
biker guy who Jason stabs.

2247
01:38:08,215 --> 01:38:10,410
So we had to cut off the tangs
in the back

2248
01:38:10,651 --> 01:38:12,414
and that welded to a plate
and put that on his back.

2249
01:38:12,653 --> 01:38:15,213
We needed to get the impact
of the pitchfork

2250
01:38:15,456 --> 01:38:18,983
and then be certain
that the handle

2251
01:38:19,226 --> 01:38:20,420
was sticking at the direct point
of the camera.

2252
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:22,629
I didn't put up a struggle.

2253
01:38:23,063 --> 01:38:26,260
I didn't, you know I just said
"Okay, it's my turn."

2254
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:29,435
I was a fairly good juggler
before being cast in the movie,

2255
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:32,468
and originally they had asked us
to do paddle balls.

2256
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:34,875
No matter how good you are,

2257
01:38:35,109 --> 01:38:37,100
you can't get the ball
to go into the camera.

2258
01:38:37,344 --> 01:38:38,971
The ball goes like that.

2259
01:38:39,213 --> 01:38:40,976
You can'tit won't go
into the camera.

2260
01:38:41,215 --> 01:38:42,648
So it just wasn't working
with the paddle balls.

2261
01:38:43,083 --> 01:38:44,107
Jeffrey could juggle
a little bit,

2262
01:38:44,351 --> 01:38:46,444
and I helped him
get a little better

2263
01:38:46,687 --> 01:38:48,951
and so me and Jeff
did the juggling scene.

2264
01:38:49,189 --> 01:38:51,350
Later in the film,
it is revealed

2265
01:38:51,592 --> 01:38:52,991
that Chris was attacked by Jason
several years earlier.

2266
01:38:53,227 --> 01:38:55,559
But for actress Dana Kimmell,

2267
01:38:55,996 --> 01:38:57,554
the implication that her
character may have been

2268
01:38:57,998 --> 01:39:01,331
sexually violated by Jason
simply went too far.

2269
01:39:01,568 --> 01:39:04,969
He had a knife...
and he attacked me with it!

2270
01:39:05,205 --> 01:39:08,265
I came on the set
and Dana and Steve

2271
01:39:08,509 --> 01:39:10,909
were arguing about what
the character should be like.

2272
01:39:11,145 --> 01:39:13,636
Steve was insisting for a sort
of daring girl

2273
01:39:14,081 --> 01:39:17,482
and which she remained
in the end.

2274
01:39:17,718 --> 01:39:20,653
But Dana wanted someone that had
a certain kind of purity.

2275
01:39:21,088 --> 01:39:22,988
He ran after me.

2276
01:39:23,223 --> 01:39:24,315
He caught me, and he pulled me
down to the ground.

2277
01:39:24,558 --> 01:39:26,992
As far as the monologue goes,

2278
01:39:27,227 --> 01:39:29,695
I don't remember all the
particulars that go with it,

2279
01:39:30,130 --> 01:39:32,155
but I know I always wanted Chris
to be portrayed

2280
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:33,627
as a very positive character.

2281
01:39:34,068 --> 01:39:35,262
I don't know what happened
after that,

2282
01:39:35,502 --> 01:39:37,299
I just don't know!

2283
01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:39,267
In fact, the revelation that
she might have been violated

2284
01:39:39,506 --> 01:39:41,167
was the most shocking

2285
01:39:41,408 --> 01:39:43,933
because that scene was a sort
of controversial scene.

2286
01:39:44,178 --> 01:39:45,975
"Should we have it,
should we not have it??"'

2287
01:39:46,213 --> 01:39:48,579
At any rate,
it was something that she won,

2288
01:39:49,016 --> 01:39:50,176
so to speak.

2289
01:39:50,417 --> 01:39:52,681
Dana Kimmell

2290
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:55,384
was and is
the consummate professional,

2291
01:39:55,622 --> 01:39:57,954
and she worked hard.

2292
01:39:58,192 --> 01:40:00,456
I mean, certainly
the movie had a bunch of goofy

2293
01:40:00,694 --> 01:40:03,219
sexuality innuendo in it
as it was,

2294
01:40:03,464 --> 01:40:05,261
but I don't think it was hurt
by that

2295
01:40:05,499 --> 01:40:07,296
if that was indeed the case.

2296
01:40:07,534 --> 01:40:09,593
The film's true defining moment
saw the transformation

2297
01:40:10,037 --> 01:40:11,698
of Jason Voorhees
from slasher movie footnote

2298
01:40:12,139 --> 01:40:14,664
into movie monster legend.

2299
01:40:15,109 --> 01:40:17,373
And no one would ever look
at a hockey mask

2300
01:40:17,611 --> 01:40:19,579
the same way again.

2301
01:40:20,014 --> 01:40:21,538
In "Friday the 1 3th Part 3,"

2302
01:40:21,782 --> 01:40:24,046
Jason wears,
for the very first time,

2303
01:40:24,284 --> 01:40:30,519
a hockey mask
which he has taken from Shelly.

2304
01:40:30,758 --> 01:40:33,989
You just see Jason suddenly turn
up in Shelly's hockey mask.

2305
01:40:34,228 --> 01:40:35,058
So you know that,
you know, Shelly's dead.

2306
01:40:35,295 --> 01:40:36,660
He not only has the hockey mask,

2307
01:40:37,097 --> 01:40:38,029
he has another mask
that he actually wears

2308
01:40:38,265 --> 01:40:40,495
earlier in the movie.

2309
01:40:40,734 --> 01:40:43,032
He actually thought to bring
two masks up to Crystal Lake,

2310
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:45,261
along with the spear gun
and a wetsuit

2311
01:40:45,506 --> 01:40:49,636
and I guess a change of clothes,
all in this little bag

2312
01:40:50,077 --> 01:40:52,204
Vera: What do you got in there?.

2313
01:40:52,446 --> 01:40:53,310
Shelly: My whole world.

2314
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:55,777
This dock behind me,

2315
01:40:56,216 --> 01:40:59,708
this is where
the legend of Jason was born.

2316
01:41:00,154 --> 01:41:04,113
This is the first time we saw
him step out in the hockey mask.

2317
01:41:04,358 --> 01:41:06,326
The birth of Jason.

2318
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:10,621
I was never a huge fan
of the sack

2319
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:12,362
because I just felt like

2320
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:15,295
it didn't have
any real substance to it,

2321
01:41:15,536 --> 01:41:21,634
and we wanted something
that would mask Jason.

2322
01:41:22,076 --> 01:41:25,045
But at the same time, you know,

2323
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:26,576
it had to have
a level of menace to it.

2324
01:41:26,814 --> 01:41:29,112
Sam Winston
made a latex mask.

2325
01:41:29,349 --> 01:41:32,045
And that's what I wore
all the way through the movie.

2326
01:41:32,286 --> 01:41:34,277
For some unknown reason
they didn't like the mask.

2327
01:41:34,521 --> 01:41:36,284
They thought it looked too much
like a monster,

2328
01:41:36,523 --> 01:41:37,683
and so they came up
with the idea to cover it

2329
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:39,752
with a hockey mask.

2330
01:41:40,194 --> 01:41:41,718
I don't think at the time
it really struck me,

2331
01:41:42,162 --> 01:41:43,720
when I saw the hockey mask,

2332
01:41:44,164 --> 01:41:46,792
that this was going to just go
on and on

2333
01:41:47,234 --> 01:41:49,532
to "Friday the 1 3th Part 1 1
and so on.

2334
01:41:49,770 --> 01:41:52,796
But I can see why.

2335
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:57,404
It did kind of create this
imposing, ominous character.

2336
01:41:57,644 --> 01:42:00,442
I think the whole hockey mask
thing was kind of a fluke.

2337
01:42:00,681 --> 01:42:02,171
I'm not really sure
how it came about.

2338
01:42:02,416 --> 01:42:04,407
God, who came up
with the hockey mask?.

2339
01:42:04,651 --> 01:42:06,551
I don't really know.

2340
01:42:06,787 --> 01:42:08,755
My recollection was that,
you know,

2341
01:42:09,189 --> 01:42:09,814
multiple kinds of masks
were brought around

2342
01:42:10,257 --> 01:42:11,781
and so on and so forth,

2343
01:42:12,226 --> 01:42:12,851
and then somebody brought
the hockey mask and said,

2344
01:42:13,293 --> 01:42:14,385
"Hockey mask, that's great."

2345
01:42:14,628 --> 01:42:15,720
I think it was Frank
that brought the mask.

2346
01:42:16,163 --> 01:42:18,188
I'm sure it was Steven.

2347
01:42:18,432 --> 01:42:21,731
I mean, he was really thoughtful
and really knew that genre.

2348
01:42:22,169 --> 01:42:24,364
The one thing that everybody
likes to take credit for

2349
01:42:24,605 --> 01:42:26,835
is who put the hockey mask
on Jason.

2350
01:42:27,274 --> 01:42:30,675
And I must admit, in modesty,

2351
01:42:30,911 --> 01:42:33,106
that I put the hockey mask
on Jason.

2352
01:42:33,347 --> 01:42:36,145
Peter Schindler, Marty Becker

2353
01:42:36,383 --> 01:42:40,376
and Marty Sadoff were all
hockey fans...

2354
01:42:40,621 --> 01:42:43,613
and it was their idea
to come up with a hockey mask

2355
01:42:43,857 --> 01:42:45,552
to cover the face up.

2356
01:42:45,792 --> 01:42:47,487
Success has a lot of fathers,

2357
01:42:47,728 --> 01:42:49,855
and everybody's willing to take
a little bit of credit for it,

2358
01:42:50,297 --> 01:42:52,288
I think,
and maybe that's just the best.

2359
01:42:52,533 --> 01:42:54,262
Once we had the mask, it was
sort of said, "This is it.

2360
01:42:54,501 --> 01:42:57,698
This is ourthis is our
signature piece."

2361
01:42:57,938 --> 01:43:01,339
It's part of the iconography
of what this movie is,

2362
01:43:01,575 --> 01:43:05,511
and so I wanted to make sure
that we held onto that.

2363
01:43:05,746 --> 01:43:08,840
With the look of its iconic
character now fully realized,

2364
01:43:09,283 --> 01:43:12,252
Jason could get back to doing
what he does best.

2365
01:43:12,486 --> 01:43:14,681
Hey, now cut that out right now.
That's not funny!

2366
01:43:14,922 --> 01:43:16,355
When that spear comes
out in the audience,

2367
01:43:16,590 --> 01:43:21,254
everybody is reflexively
avoiding that.

2368
01:43:21,495 --> 01:43:22,860
I mean, that was awesome.

2369
01:43:23,297 --> 01:43:26,562
And there was a cable that
was actually set up

2370
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,665
on the post that ran across

2371
01:43:28,902 --> 01:43:30,369
to where she was standing,

2372
01:43:30,604 --> 01:43:33,266
and I basically think,

2373
01:43:33,507 --> 01:43:35,236
kind of was rigged
in such a way

2374
01:43:35,475 --> 01:43:37,340
that I actually hooked the gun
onto the cable

2375
01:43:37,578 --> 01:43:42,447
and shot it so it went
straight down the cable.

2376
01:43:42,683 --> 01:43:45,208
And then we made an acrylic
plate that fit over her eyeball.

2377
01:43:45,452 --> 01:43:47,215
We had to do it in one take

2378
01:43:47,454 --> 01:43:49,854
because the minute
I hit the water,

2379
01:43:50,290 --> 01:43:53,919
the little prosthetic
was kind of spongy,

2380
01:43:54,361 --> 01:43:56,420
and it would absorb the water
and just kind of slide off.

2381
01:43:56,663 --> 01:43:57,391
But it was fun.
It was really a lot of fun.

2382
01:43:57,631 --> 01:43:59,792
Andy: How do we do it?.

2383
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:01,667
Debbie: Well, first
we take our clothes off.

2384
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:04,564
For me, the most
trying situation

2385
01:44:04,805 --> 01:44:06,705
about making this movie
was that I was a kid

2386
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:08,202
and this was the first movie
I had ever done

2387
01:44:08,442 --> 01:44:10,842
without my parent on the set.

2388
01:44:11,278 --> 01:44:13,439
I was 1 8 and I had to do
a shower scene

2389
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:15,409
where there was
some frontal nudity.

2390
01:44:15,649 --> 01:44:17,947
In the beginning,
I might have been

2391
01:44:18,385 --> 01:44:19,647
a little uncomfortable with it
but all these years later,

2392
01:44:19,886 --> 01:44:21,683
I think, 'Wow, I had
a pretty nice body.' (laughs)

2393
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:23,856
Jeffrey Rogers' part
in the show

2394
01:44:24,291 --> 01:44:26,885
was he came walking down
the hallway on his hands,

2395
01:44:27,327 --> 01:44:29,852
and he's basically wearing
just a pair of jeans

2396
01:44:30,297 --> 01:44:32,629
and then Jason shows up
with a machete

2397
01:44:32,866 --> 01:44:35,494
and basically splits him
in half from the groin down

2398
01:44:35,736 --> 01:44:36,532
through his chest.

2399
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:40,001
So he splits wide open.

2400
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:43,307
I mean,
that is horrifically gory

2401
01:44:43,543 --> 01:44:45,977
but it's classic Jason.

2402
01:44:46,413 --> 01:44:48,313
And we did a body cast
of him in pieces.

2403
01:44:48,548 --> 01:44:50,778
They actually, in the house,

2404
01:44:51,018 --> 01:44:55,546
built a Plexiglas floor that the
camera was mounted down inside

2405
01:44:55,789 --> 01:44:56,881
so we could do the shot
through the floor,

2406
01:44:57,324 --> 01:44:58,985
up to the ceiling.

2407
01:44:59,426 --> 01:45:02,554
Then, of course,
there's the next scene

2408
01:45:02,796 --> 01:45:06,288
where Tracie Savage sees Jeffrey
stuffed up in the rafters.

2409
01:45:06,533 --> 01:45:09,297
Even actress Tracie Savage
was unaware

2410
01:45:09,536 --> 01:45:11,663
of just how closely
her on- screen death

2411
01:45:11,905 --> 01:45:14,931
resembled that of a certain
famous, yet ill-fated, character

2412
01:45:15,375 --> 01:45:17,400
from the original
"Friday the 1 3th."

2413
01:45:17,644 --> 01:45:20,272
I had no idea that Kevin Bacon
and I have so much in common.

2414
01:45:20,514 --> 01:45:22,311
Another six degree separation
from Kevin Bacon.

2415
01:45:22,549 --> 01:45:23,379
There you go.

2416
01:45:23,617 --> 01:45:25,050
We died the same way?.

2417
01:45:25,485 --> 01:45:27,612
I was in makeup for 4 hours

2418
01:45:27,854 --> 01:45:29,947
so that they could
glue this torso to my neck.

2419
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:32,324
Then it was lighting
for another 2-3 hours.

2420
01:45:32,559 --> 01:45:34,959
All for a 3-second shot.

2421
01:45:35,395 --> 01:45:37,522
And you had to get it right

2422
01:45:37,764 --> 01:45:40,392
because then, if you don't,
you gotta do it all over again.

2423
01:45:40,634 --> 01:45:41,601
So we were all kind of
on pins and needles.

2424
01:45:41,835 --> 01:45:43,496
I think that line...

2425
01:45:43,737 --> 01:45:45,364
Chris: We would have
been there already

2426
01:45:45,605 --> 01:45:46,003
if some people didn't have to
go to the bathroom

2427
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:48,340
every five minutes.

2428
01:45:48,575 --> 01:45:49,667
Debbie: That's what happens
when you're pregnant.

2429
01:45:49,910 --> 01:45:54,074
was put in there just to make
the teenage kids go...ooh.

2430
01:45:54,514 --> 01:45:55,708
and then when I'm killed make
it even more grisly and awful.

2431
01:45:55,949 --> 01:45:58,417
This is a pregnant woman.

2432
01:45:58,652 --> 01:46:00,483
There was never a death scene
filmed for Shelly.

2433
01:46:00,721 --> 01:46:02,086
It was always--that's exactly
how it was in the script.

2434
01:46:02,522 --> 01:46:03,420
I guess you're supposed
to think, well,

2435
01:46:03,657 --> 01:46:04,919
maybe he's joking again?.

2436
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:07,418
Nice make-up job.

2437
01:46:07,661 --> 01:46:09,959
Although obviously the audience
knows he's not joking

2438
01:46:10,397 --> 01:46:11,728
because they've seen Jason kill
a bunch of people.

2439
01:46:11,965 --> 01:46:13,455
I think I did the first take,

2440
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:15,361
and I think I heard
some people chuckling.

2441
01:46:15,602 --> 01:46:16,933
They were like -
they were like, 'That's bad.'

2442
01:46:17,371 --> 01:46:19,100
I was like--
that all got into my head.

2443
01:46:19,539 --> 01:46:21,700
It's not the greatest
death scene in the world.

2444
01:46:21,942 --> 01:46:23,534
Well, I don't know
what's going on,

2445
01:46:23,777 --> 01:46:25,039
but I'm gonna go outside
and take a look around.

2446
01:46:25,479 --> 01:46:26,844
I think my favorite kill
was probably

2447
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:28,547
Rick getting his eye popped out.

2448
01:46:28,782 --> 01:46:30,113
They did change the name
of the character.

2449
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:32,450
In the original script
it was Derek,

2450
01:46:32,686 --> 01:46:33,846
and the reason
why they changed it

2451
01:46:34,087 --> 01:46:36,578
was at the end of the film
when I go outside,

2452
01:46:36,823 --> 01:46:38,814
and I get killed,

2453
01:46:39,059 --> 01:46:41,994
and she comes out and starts
yelling the name out,

2454
01:46:42,429 --> 01:46:45,057
that they wanted a monosyllabic
name for her to say.

2455
01:46:45,499 --> 01:46:46,830
Rick?.!

2456
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:48,591
You know, of course,

2457
01:46:48,835 --> 01:46:50,826
the death
that my character experienced,

2458
01:46:51,071 --> 01:46:52,902
me getting my head crushed,

2459
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:56,667
was I mean, this was, yeah,
that's historic.

2460
01:46:56,910 --> 01:46:59,674
I just remember when
Paul's eyeball popped out,

2461
01:46:59,913 --> 01:47:01,904
the whole audience just screamed
at that one and it was like,

2462
01:47:02,149 --> 01:47:03,639
Oh, that's great.

2463
01:47:03,884 --> 01:47:05,374
Technically,
it was very hard to do,

2464
01:47:05,619 --> 01:47:06,677
and it was one of those things

2465
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08,114
you only had one chance
of doing it,

2466
01:47:08,555 --> 01:47:11,718
especially the 3D effect.

2467
01:47:11,958 --> 01:47:15,758
Well, in actuality we did
the Paul Kratka head twice.

2468
01:47:15,996 --> 01:47:18,487
I was actually playing
with a bunch of stuff

2469
01:47:18,732 --> 01:47:20,996
trying to figure out how to make
and collapse the head properly.

2470
01:47:21,435 --> 01:47:23,130
Anytime they wanted to,
we could just pull the string

2471
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:25,595
and the eye
would pop out of the socket

2472
01:47:25,839 --> 01:47:27,773
and come straight down the line
toward camera.

2473
01:47:28,008 --> 01:47:31,102
The last part of the filming
was basically Jason and Chris.

2474
01:47:31,545 --> 01:47:32,910
(Chris screams)

2475
01:47:33,146 --> 01:47:35,171
And a lot of night shooting.

2476
01:47:35,615 --> 01:47:37,708
She runs up the stairs, and
I'm at the bottom of the stairs

2477
01:47:37,951 --> 01:47:39,612
and she tips the bookcase up
on top of me.

2478
01:47:39,853 --> 01:47:41,844
And I have to say
that hurt like hell.

2479
01:47:42,088 --> 01:47:45,489
It's Dana who finds me
in the closet later on

2480
01:47:45,725 --> 01:47:46,851
with the knife
sticking out of my neck

2481
01:47:47,093 --> 01:47:48,993
after I've already been killed.

2482
01:47:49,229 --> 01:47:50,958
It was an easy day. I didn't
have to memorize any lines.

2483
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:53,564
When he's breaking down
that door,

2484
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,859
and the whole thing where
he gets stabbed in the hand

2485
01:47:56,102 --> 01:47:57,865
and stabbed in the leg,
those are intense moments.

2486
01:47:58,104 --> 01:48:00,470
I mean, those grip you

2487
01:48:00,707 --> 01:48:04,143
because then it becomes him
not so much a monster

2488
01:48:04,578 --> 01:48:08,605
as a human who has
monstrous capabilities.

2489
01:48:08,849 --> 01:48:09,838
And then I chased her
up the stairs,

2490
01:48:10,083 --> 01:48:11,516
and she went in
through the bedroom window

2491
01:48:11,751 --> 01:48:13,013
and went out the window.

2492
01:48:13,253 --> 01:48:14,777
Then she tried to run away
in the car,

2493
01:48:15,021 --> 01:48:16,147
and the car ran out of gas
on the bridge.

2494
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:18,217
No!!

2495
01:48:18,658 --> 01:48:20,649
I think I kept in shape
doing that film.

2496
01:48:20,894 --> 01:48:23,021
There were --
there was a time or two

2497
01:48:23,263 --> 01:48:25,128
where I was running
through the woods

2498
01:48:25,565 --> 01:48:27,089
right after the scene
where he grabs me in the van,

2499
01:48:27,534 --> 01:48:29,502
and, you know,
breaks the window with his head,

2500
01:48:29,736 --> 01:48:31,101
and I bolt out the other side.

2501
01:48:31,538 --> 01:48:34,701
There's a place
where I run and fall,

2502
01:48:34,941 --> 01:48:37,535
and actually when I did that,
I didn't get hurt

2503
01:48:37,777 --> 01:48:41,474
but people in the cast--
in the crew were just gasping

2504
01:48:41,715 --> 01:48:42,875
because they thought
I had really fallen

2505
01:48:43,116 --> 01:48:44,743
and smacked my face.

2506
01:48:44,985 --> 01:48:46,782
So that was good.

2507
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:48,885
When I went into the barn
after her,

2508
01:48:49,122 --> 01:48:52,614
you know, it was--Steve and l
had obviously spoken about it,

2509
01:48:52,859 --> 01:48:56,590
and Jason at this point is now
really angry

2510
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:58,491
because he hasn't managed to do
what he wanted to do

2511
01:48:58,732 --> 01:48:59,790
and that was kill her.

2512
01:49:00,033 --> 01:49:04,026
And so, he just said, you know,

2513
01:49:04,271 --> 01:49:06,967
we don't need the barn anymore
so just tear it up.

2514
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:10,108
So I grabbed whatever I could
and smashed whatever I could.

2515
01:49:10,544 --> 01:49:13,104
But then the scene
in the barn on the beam,

2516
01:49:13,547 --> 01:49:15,014
I actually did that
and shimmied out

2517
01:49:15,248 --> 01:49:16,545
and that was,
you know, I don't know,

2518
01:49:16,783 --> 01:49:18,273
20 feet above the ground,

2519
01:49:18,718 --> 01:49:20,083
and I ended up with some bruises
from that one,

2520
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:22,550
but I turned out okay.

2521
01:49:22,789 --> 01:49:24,654
Jason gets pushed
out of the barn,

2522
01:49:24,891 --> 01:49:26,882
and he's hanging and the mask
has to come off,

2523
01:49:27,127 --> 01:49:29,960
and she sees his face
for the first time

2524
01:49:30,196 --> 01:49:32,994
and recognizes who he is.
- It's you!

2525
01:49:33,233 --> 01:49:35,224
We had a mold
of Richard Brooker's head,

2526
01:49:35,669 --> 01:49:38,900
and we wanted the axe
to be able to stick,

2527
01:49:39,139 --> 01:49:41,266
so that's why we used
the rigid polyfoam

2528
01:49:41,708 --> 01:49:43,005
so the axe had something
to stick into.

2529
01:49:43,243 --> 01:49:46,041
There wasn't that much makeup
until the dream sequence.

2530
01:49:46,279 --> 01:49:48,679
I used to have to go in
and do about 6,

2531
01:49:48,915 --> 01:49:50,940
sometimes 7 hours of makeup.

2532
01:49:51,184 --> 01:49:53,152
And it was 1 1 different
appliances

2533
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:54,281
that they glued to my face,

2534
01:49:54,721 --> 01:49:56,951
with the one eye lower down,

2535
01:49:57,190 --> 01:49:58,680
you know, and certain teeth
and the whole thing.

2536
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:00,859
It was awfully painful.

2537
01:50:01,094 --> 01:50:02,891
I mean, he had to be in that
make-up for like 6 hours,

2538
01:50:03,129 --> 01:50:05,029
and it was hot and sweaty.

2539
01:50:05,265 --> 01:50:09,725
And you could see that he
was very uncomfortable.

2540
01:50:09,970 --> 01:50:11,961
The bad part about it was
that as soon as they finished,

2541
01:50:12,205 --> 01:50:15,231
it was usually lunch time,
and I couldn't eat.

2542
01:50:15,675 --> 01:50:17,199
So they used to give me
Tiger's Milk through a straw

2543
01:50:17,644 --> 01:50:19,168
so I would get some nourishment
for the day.

2544
01:50:19,613 --> 01:50:21,706
We shot the ending twice.

2545
01:50:21,948 --> 01:50:24,781
We actually did another ending.

2546
01:50:25,018 --> 01:50:28,010
Dana Kimmell comes up to the
door of the house in a dream,

2547
01:50:28,254 --> 01:50:31,189
and Jason comes through the
front door and decapitates her.

2548
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:34,253
And that was just
an alternate ending

2549
01:50:34,694 --> 01:50:34,716
that somewhere along the lines
somebody came up with.

2550
01:50:34,928 --> 01:50:37,294
It was a very quick thing.

2551
01:50:37,731 --> 01:50:39,289
It wasn't something that,
you know,

2552
01:50:39,733 --> 01:50:41,030
we knew was going to happen
in advance.

2553
01:50:41,267 --> 01:50:42,928
It was just kind of
one of those added scenes

2554
01:50:43,169 --> 01:50:44,932
that they said let's just
do this real quick.

2555
01:50:45,171 --> 01:50:49,198
It was only when we did
the infamous alternate ending

2556
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:51,838
that you really started
to see his face

2557
01:50:52,078 --> 01:50:53,340
and that's what
they didn't like,

2558
01:50:53,780 --> 01:50:55,270
and that's why
the alternate ending

2559
01:50:55,715 --> 01:50:57,080
was totally scrapped
out of the movie.

2560
01:50:57,317 --> 01:50:59,945
So we made the mask.
We sculpted it.

2561
01:51:00,186 --> 01:51:03,087
Then they came up with the new
dream sequence

2562
01:51:03,323 --> 01:51:07,817
that Jason's at the house,

2563
01:51:08,061 --> 01:51:09,653
and she sees him
at the top window

2564
01:51:09,896 --> 01:51:11,193
and then comes down and blasts
through the door.

2565
01:51:11,431 --> 01:51:14,889
Steve Miner said that he wanted
this creature

2566
01:51:15,135 --> 01:51:16,102
to come out of the lake as if
it was Mrs. Voorhees

2567
01:51:16,336 --> 01:51:18,304
who had been down there
for awhile.

2568
01:51:18,738 --> 01:51:19,363
I have no idea
how she got her body back,

2569
01:51:19,806 --> 01:51:21,137
but it's a dream.

2570
01:51:21,374 --> 01:51:23,342
They gave us Marilyn Poucher
and just said,

2571
01:51:23,777 --> 01:51:26,746
"She's your guinea pig.
Use her."

2572
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:28,277
Little did she know
what she was in for.

2573
01:51:28,715 --> 01:51:29,943
Once we started
doing the makeup,

2574
01:51:30,183 --> 01:51:31,810
it took about 6 hours,

2575
01:51:32,052 --> 01:51:32,814
and I remember
just sort of like,

2576
01:51:33,053 --> 01:51:34,281
falling asleep at certain times.

2577
01:51:34,721 --> 01:51:36,689
It was just downright horrible

2578
01:51:36,923 --> 01:51:40,256
because the water was just
full of mosquito larvae

2579
01:51:40,694 --> 01:51:43,322
and baby frogs and tadpoles.

2580
01:51:43,763 --> 01:51:46,129
It was just like--
oh, it was pretty nasty.

2581
01:51:46,366 --> 01:51:49,028
Covered her in river slime
and vinyl worms,

2582
01:51:49,269 --> 01:51:50,395
and the rest is history.

2583
01:51:50,837 --> 01:51:54,933
[Chris screams]

2584
01:51:55,175 --> 01:51:58,110
So this is the actual mask
that was done of my skin.

2585
01:51:58,344 --> 01:52:01,313
It's a little, a little--
oh, here's a worm. (laughs)

2586
01:52:01,748 --> 01:52:02,715
Luckily they were able
to cut it off,

2587
01:52:02,949 --> 01:52:04,712
and we peeled it off

2588
01:52:04,951 --> 01:52:06,043
because then I had to do
the shot three more times.

2589
01:52:06,286 --> 01:52:08,254
While not as deliberately
ambiguous

2590
01:52:08,488 --> 01:52:10,012
as the ending of "Part 2,"

2591
01:52:10,256 --> 01:52:11,314
the film's conclusion suggests

2592
01:52:11,758 --> 01:52:13,089
that the door has again
been left open

2593
01:52:13,326 --> 01:52:15,157
for the return of Jason.

2594
01:52:15,395 --> 01:52:18,228
But what of the fate
of traumatized Chris Higgins

2595
01:52:18,465 --> 01:52:21,127
who was never seen
or heard from again?.

2596
01:52:21,367 --> 01:52:23,699
I would say Chris has recovered.

2597
01:52:23,937 --> 01:52:26,963
Even though she drove away
looking like she was losing it

2598
01:52:27,207 --> 01:52:28,731
there in the back
of the cop car,

2599
01:52:28,975 --> 01:52:30,067
I think
that she was strong enough

2600
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:34,076
to recover and move on.

2601
01:52:34,314 --> 01:52:37,943
And that's the way I wanted
to portray that character,

2602
01:52:38,184 --> 01:52:40,812
as a survivor,
and I think Chris did that.

2603
01:52:41,054 --> 01:52:43,318
(Screams)

2604
01:52:43,757 --> 01:52:45,384
A new dimension in terror.

2605
01:52:45,825 --> 01:52:48,293
It will scare you!

2606
01:52:48,528 --> 01:52:52,362
"Friday the 1 3th Part 3"
was released on August 1 3, 1 982

2607
01:52:52,799 --> 01:52:54,733
with Paramount spending
millions of dollars

2608
01:52:54,968 --> 01:52:56,458
to equip theaters
with the new technology

2609
01:52:56,903 --> 01:52:58,495
required to show the 3D film.

2610
01:52:58,938 --> 01:53:00,906
Their investment
quickly paid off

2611
01:53:01,141 --> 01:53:03,132
when the film managed

2612
01:53:03,376 --> 01:53:05,105
to knock the year's reigning
box office champion,

2613
01:53:05,345 --> 01:53:09,441
Steven Spielberg's "E.T.,"
from the #1 spot.

2614
01:53:09,883 --> 01:53:13,512
With a final U.S. take
of $36.7 million,

2615
01:53:13,953 --> 01:53:15,944
"Friday the 1 3th Part 3"

2616
01:53:16,189 --> 01:53:19,215
ushered in a new wave
of 3D films in the 1 980s.

2617
01:53:19,459 --> 01:53:22,019
And remains one of the most
profitable installments

2618
01:53:22,262 --> 01:53:23,752
of the franchise.

2619
01:53:23,997 --> 01:53:30,300
I believe the choice to do this
in 3D

2620
01:53:30,537 --> 01:53:32,368
was really risky but,
in retrospect,

2621
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:34,501
it was brilliant.

2622
01:53:34,941 --> 01:53:38,240
"Friday the 1 3th Part 3"
was the first big hit 3D movie

2623
01:53:38,478 --> 01:53:40,912
of the 80s and the audience
was just screaming.

2624
01:53:41,147 --> 01:53:43,012
And we made our money back

2625
01:53:43,249 --> 01:53:47,015
before the first matinee show
in Los Angeles.

2626
01:53:47,253 --> 01:53:49,847
And I find that very rewarding,

2627
01:53:50,089 --> 01:53:52,557
and it's been great being
able to meet people

2628
01:53:52,992 --> 01:53:54,016
that appreciate
and have enjoyed those films

2629
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:56,990
from back then.

2630
01:53:57,230 --> 01:53:59,198
Actress Tracie Savage went on
to a successful career

2631
01:53:59,432 --> 01:54:00,558
as a broadcast journalist.

2632
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,230
Best known for her coverage

2633
01:54:03,469 --> 01:54:05,903
of the sensational OJ Simpson
murder trial in 1 995.

2634
01:54:06,139 --> 01:54:08,300
As a news reporter

2635
01:54:08,541 --> 01:54:09,940
in different markets
all across the country,

2636
01:54:10,176 --> 01:54:11,108
people knew where to find me.

2637
01:54:11,344 --> 01:54:13,244
They'd see me on the air

2638
01:54:13,479 --> 01:54:15,379
and every newsroom I've ever
worked in,

2639
01:54:15,615 --> 01:54:17,879
I've always gotten fan mail
from "Friday the 1 3th" fans.

2640
01:54:18,117 --> 01:54:20,176
And I still do. I still do.

2641
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:22,285
Part of the charm
of the movies are, is that,

2642
01:54:22,522 --> 01:54:24,251
you know, it really
invited people to engage.

2643
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:28,256
It really invited people
to go out, have fun.

2644
01:54:28,494 --> 01:54:33,557
And when we did that film,
at the time

2645
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,365
that was going to be the last
"Friday the 1 3th."

2646
01:54:35,602 --> 01:54:38,036
At the wrap party,
Frank Mancuso declared

2647
01:54:38,271 --> 01:54:39,260
that he was not going to produce
another one.

2648
01:54:39,505 --> 01:54:41,336
This is the permanent death.

2649
01:54:41,574 --> 01:54:42,939
We're not
going to do this again.

2650
01:54:43,176 --> 01:54:44,837
This is it. He's dead.

2651
01:54:45,078 --> 01:54:47,342
They really stressed the fact

2652
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:48,569
that they wanted to make sure
that I had killed Jason

2653
01:54:49,015 --> 01:55:01,394
because that was going to be it.

2654
01:55:01,394 --> 01:55:17,937
because that was going to be it.

2655
01:55:18,177 --> 01:55:20,338
When Paramount announced
a fourth 'Friday the 1 3th"

2656
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:22,104
at the end of 1 983,

2657
01:55:22,348 --> 01:55:24,282
producer Frank Mancuso, Jr.

2658
01:55:24,517 --> 01:55:25,984
was feeling
the critical backlash

2659
01:55:26,219 --> 01:55:27,516
against slasher films.

2660
01:55:27,954 --> 01:55:29,979
And 'Friday the 1 3th"
in particular.

2661
01:55:30,223 --> 01:55:32,316
He decided it was time
to kill off Jason

2662
01:55:32,558 --> 01:55:34,549
once and for all.

2663
01:55:34,994 --> 01:55:36,484
When we got done with 3,

2664
01:55:36,930 --> 01:55:39,057
I was like, "Okay,

2665
01:55:39,299 --> 01:55:41,563
what I want to do now is l
really want to bring this thing

2666
01:55:42,001 --> 01:55:44,128
to an effective close."

2667
01:55:44,370 --> 01:55:45,667
With the departure
of Steve Miner,

2668
01:55:46,105 --> 01:55:48,403
Mancuso
and investor Phil Scuderi

2669
01:55:48,641 --> 01:55:50,006
set their sights on finding
a new director.

2670
01:55:50,243 --> 01:55:53,041
Their search led them
to Joseph Zito,

2671
01:55:53,279 --> 01:55:55,213
who had impressed Scuderi
with his 1 981 slasher film,

2672
01:55:55,448 --> 01:55:56,972
"The Prowler."

2673
01:55:57,216 --> 01:55:58,649
With an early draft
of the script

2674
01:55:59,085 --> 01:56:01,645
written by the late
Bruce Hidemi Sakow,

2675
01:56:02,088 --> 01:56:05,922
the filmmakers set out to make
the best and "final" chapter.

2676
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:07,387
The people at Paramount
said this to me.

2677
01:56:07,627 --> 01:56:08,252
They weren't going to do
any more films

2678
01:56:08,494 --> 01:56:09,961
and this was the last.

2679
01:56:10,196 --> 01:56:12,596
So I knew that it would be
book ended

2680
01:56:13,032 --> 01:56:15,330
with a dead Jason
and another dead Jason,

2681
01:56:15,568 --> 01:56:17,433
you know, at the end.

2682
01:56:17,670 --> 01:56:19,228
We'll do some things
that refer to our past.

2683
01:56:19,472 --> 01:56:22,202
Jason's out there.

2684
01:56:22,442 --> 01:56:26,276
We'll bring this thing
to its rightful conclusion.

2685
01:56:26,512 --> 01:56:27,604
Noooo!

2686
01:56:28,047 --> 01:56:29,014
And we'll be done.

2687
01:56:29,248 --> 01:56:31,045
So the idea for the last movie,

2688
01:56:31,284 --> 01:56:33,718
which we thought
"The Final Chapter" was,

2689
01:56:34,153 --> 01:56:38,613
was just to resurrect Jason
one more time

2690
01:56:39,058 --> 01:56:41,083
and then kill him in a way
where the film grammar

2691
01:56:41,327 --> 01:56:43,192
said he's really dead.

2692
01:56:43,429 --> 01:56:46,728
I wanted to pick it up
exactly where Friday 3 left off.

2693
01:56:47,166 --> 01:56:51,193
That he was on the ground just
exactly where you had left him.

2694
01:56:51,437 --> 01:56:55,601
We crane down on a bunch
of police cars arriving,

2695
01:56:56,042 --> 01:56:58,442
helicopter has a searchlight.

2696
01:56:58,678 --> 01:57:00,168
You know, gives you kind of
a big-budget feel

2697
01:57:00,413 --> 01:57:02,506
and very dramatic opening.

2698
01:57:02,749 --> 01:57:04,614
I held off Jason
coming to life for a long time

2699
01:57:05,051 --> 01:57:07,110
in the film.

2700
01:57:07,353 --> 01:57:09,446
The audience is continuously
on edge through these kind

2701
01:57:09,689 --> 01:57:11,680
of languorous, elegant shots.

2702
01:57:12,125 --> 01:57:15,424
When is Jason going
to re-awaken?.

2703
01:57:15,661 --> 01:57:18,596
The audience certainly is not
going to believe he's dead,

2704
01:57:19,032 --> 01:57:22,160
but they become co-conspirators
in bringing him to life.

2705
01:57:22,402 --> 01:57:24,563
They start yelling at the screen
for him to get up.

2706
01:57:24,804 --> 01:57:27,204
So instead of groaning
that he gets up too soon,

2707
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:30,000
and they say, aw, this is fake,
they make him get up.

2708
01:57:30,243 --> 01:57:32,609
As Jason's put into the freezer,

2709
01:57:33,046 --> 01:57:36,482
we see a little puff of air
so we get the first hint

2710
01:57:36,716 --> 01:57:41,153
that Jason is not dead.

2711
01:57:41,387 --> 01:57:45,084
Once again, the producers chose
to recast the role of Jason.

2712
01:57:45,324 --> 01:57:47,519
This time turning to a rough
trade Hollywood veteran

2713
01:57:47,760 --> 01:57:50,490
to don the hockey mask.

2714
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:52,357
Regarding the actor
to play Jason,

2715
01:57:52,598 --> 01:57:55,158
I wanted to go with a really
experienced Hollywood stuntman

2716
01:57:55,401 --> 01:57:57,528
and Ted White was a very--

2717
01:57:57,770 --> 01:58:00,261
he had doubled famous, you know,
Hollwood actors.

2718
01:58:00,506 --> 01:58:03,236
He was an older guy, way older,

2719
01:58:03,476 --> 01:58:04,568
twice the age,
almost three times the age

2720
01:58:04,811 --> 01:58:06,142
of some of the kids
he was killing.

2721
01:58:06,379 --> 01:58:07,607
I actually turned it down
to begin with

2722
01:58:07,847 --> 01:58:09,212
and later on I did accept it.

2723
01:58:09,449 --> 01:58:11,713
After I accepted it,
I did go down

2724
01:58:12,151 --> 01:58:13,743
and rent two of the Jasons,

2725
01:58:14,187 --> 01:58:16,348
and I watched Jason itself,

2726
01:58:16,589 --> 01:58:18,523
how he moved and so forth.

2727
01:58:18,758 --> 01:58:21,056
And I felt that I'd like to
play him a little bit different.

2728
01:58:21,294 --> 01:58:23,262
I'd like for him to move
a little bit different.

2729
01:58:23,496 --> 01:58:25,464
I didn't want that
slow motion routine anymore,

2730
01:58:25,698 --> 01:58:27,598
and I thought that if this is
the final chapter,

2731
01:58:27,834 --> 01:58:29,131
then that's the way
I'd like to take it out.

2732
01:58:29,368 --> 01:58:31,393
He has a sense
of dramatic timing

2733
01:58:31,637 --> 01:58:34,299
that other Jasons, you know,
maybe didn't think about

2734
01:58:34,540 --> 01:58:37,168
in the same way because they
didn't have 40 years experience

2735
01:58:37,410 --> 01:58:39,378
of being before the camera.

2736
01:58:39,612 --> 01:58:41,671
There was a nurse there
that I'm supposed to strangle,

2737
01:58:42,115 --> 01:58:44,208
and when I shoved her
up against the wall,

2738
01:58:44,450 --> 01:58:46,213
she had a button
on the back of her cap,

2739
01:58:46,452 --> 01:58:48,511
and when her head hit the wall,

2740
01:58:48,754 --> 01:58:50,381
the button kind of penetrated
her head just a little bit,

2741
01:58:50,623 --> 01:58:52,250
and she yelled out.

2742
01:58:52,492 --> 01:58:54,323
These are the times
when you back up

2743
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:55,458
and say you're not really Jason,
you know.

2744
01:58:55,695 --> 01:58:57,686
You're just doing a thing here.

2745
01:58:58,131 --> 01:59:00,497
You're supposed to be making a
few bucks and not hurt anybody.

2746
01:59:00,733 --> 01:59:02,826
You know, this is not a guy
who was waiting his whole life,

2747
01:59:03,269 --> 01:59:04,395
he's not a fan of
"Friday the 1 3th,"

2748
01:59:04,637 --> 01:59:05,467
and someone who was waiting
for the opportunity

2749
01:59:05,705 --> 01:59:07,138
to be in 'Friday the 1 3th."

2750
01:59:07,373 --> 01:59:10,570
It's a guy who came to work
and had to put a mask on

2751
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:12,607
and had to put fake teeth
in that made him drool

2752
01:59:12,845 --> 01:59:13,869
and was embarrassed
by the entire thing,

2753
01:59:14,313 --> 01:59:15,575
was happy that you couldn't
see his face.

2754
01:59:15,815 --> 01:59:18,841
The job of creating the film's
bloody make-up effects

2755
01:59:19,285 --> 01:59:21,116
initially went to future
Oscar winner Greg Cannom.

2756
01:59:21,354 --> 01:59:23,254
But when Cannom left the project

2757
01:59:23,489 --> 01:59:26,253
due to 'personality
differences,'

2758
01:59:26,492 --> 01:59:29,723
director Joe Zito called upon
the one man

2759
01:59:30,163 --> 01:59:32,723
who could rightfully be called
Jason's father.

2760
01:59:33,166 --> 01:59:33,894
It's almost like
I'm Dr. Frankenstein.

2761
01:59:34,333 --> 01:59:36,301
I created the monster.

2762
01:59:36,536 --> 01:59:40,267
Thank you for letting me
kill the monster, which I did.

2763
01:59:40,506 --> 01:59:42,599
Tom Savini did a wonderful job,
I thought, of makeup.

2764
01:59:42,842 --> 01:59:45,208
And that was a 4 1 /2 hour
makeup job every morning.

2765
01:59:45,444 --> 01:59:47,173
I actually replaced
a makeup artist

2766
01:59:47,413 --> 01:59:49,472
on "The Final Chapter,"

2767
01:59:49,715 --> 01:59:51,444
and luckily,
that's what they were doing.

2768
01:59:51,684 --> 01:59:53,811
They were designing
the adult Jason

2769
01:59:54,253 --> 01:59:56,585
from my makeup design
on the kid,

2770
01:59:56,822 --> 01:59:58,619
which is only logical
I would think, you know,

2771
01:59:58,858 --> 02:00:01,224
so I was glad
they were doing it,

2772
02:00:01,460 --> 02:00:01,892
but I had nothing to do
with the design, you know.

2773
02:00:02,328 --> 02:00:04,319
They did a very good job.

2774
02:00:04,564 --> 02:00:05,588
It's funny that in all of
our conversations

2775
02:00:05,831 --> 02:00:07,492
about Jason coming back to life,

2776
02:00:07,733 --> 02:00:09,462
nobody ever used the word
zombie--ever.

2777
02:00:09,702 --> 02:00:11,431
We never heard it.

2778
02:00:11,671 --> 02:00:14,435
We knew you couldn't
exactly kill him,

2779
02:00:14,674 --> 02:00:19,236
and he would always
be coming back to life.

2780
02:00:19,478 --> 02:00:21,571
So it's sort of like
he just wouldn't die.

2781
02:00:21,814 --> 02:00:23,281
You can't be alive!

2782
02:00:23,516 --> 02:00:25,575
After escaping from the morgue,

2783
02:00:25,818 --> 02:00:28,685
Jason returns to his familiar
slayground at Crystal Lake

2784
02:00:28,921 --> 02:00:31,287
Where he quickly sets his sights
on the Jarvis family.

2785
02:00:31,524 --> 02:00:33,754
A recently divorced mother,

2786
02:00:33,993 --> 02:00:36,257
a pretty-yet-reserved
teenage daughter,

2787
02:00:36,495 --> 02:00:39,623
and a very special boy
named Tommy.

2788
02:00:39,865 --> 02:00:41,696
I remember walking into
the casting office

2789
02:00:41,934 --> 02:00:43,697
and going "Friday the 1 3th?. "

2790
02:00:43,936 --> 02:00:45,369
I thought this was
for "Halloween."

2791
02:00:45,605 --> 02:00:47,630
and they were like, "No, no, no.

2792
02:00:47,873 --> 02:00:49,306
It's 'Friday the 13th."

2793
02:00:49,542 --> 02:00:51,237
And I was like, "Oh, right,
of course. I knew that."

2794
02:00:51,477 --> 02:00:53,809
Corey walked in there,
and he was so alive,

2795
02:00:54,247 --> 02:00:58,479
and so friendly and he and l,
just we clicked.

2796
02:00:58,718 --> 02:01:01,243
I went, I did my audition
and then at the end of it,

2797
02:01:01,487 --> 02:01:03,955
I remember my mom
telling me like, "Okay,

2798
02:01:04,390 --> 02:01:06,290
they really liked you a lot
but they have some concerns."

2799
02:01:06,525 --> 02:01:08,550
And I said,
"What are the concerns?. "

2800
02:01:08,794 --> 02:01:10,785
And she said, 'Well, they just
think you're too small,

2801
02:01:11,030 --> 02:01:12,622
and, you know,
it's not very believable

2802
02:01:12,865 --> 02:01:14,730
that this little tiny kid

2803
02:01:14,967 --> 02:01:16,832
is going to pick up the machete
and, you know,

2804
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:20,603
whack the hell out of this
6 foot 5 bad guy.

2805
02:01:20,840 --> 02:01:24,606
And I went, "Give me a machete.
Let's give it a shot." (Laughs)

2806
02:01:24,844 --> 02:01:26,539
And I think that was
the end of it.

2807
02:01:26,779 --> 02:01:29,839
You could see with Corey.
You really could.

2808
02:01:30,283 --> 02:01:31,545
This young man
was going to skyrocket.

2809
02:01:31,784 --> 02:01:33,752
And I remember
it was a very big deal

2810
02:01:33,986 --> 02:01:34,975
because "Gremlins" and "Friday"
were both coming out

2811
02:01:35,421 --> 02:01:37,412
pretty much
over the same summer,

2812
02:01:37,657 --> 02:01:38,487
within a couple weeks
of each other

2813
02:01:38,724 --> 02:01:39,782
from what I remember,

2814
02:01:40,026 --> 02:01:42,722
so that was very exciting
as a kid

2815
02:01:42,962 --> 02:01:44,896
to have these two giant
blockbusters coming out.

2816
02:01:45,331 --> 02:01:48,664
I think Kimberly and Corey and l
got along well

2817
02:01:48,901 --> 02:01:50,801
because they're just
nice people.

2818
02:01:51,037 --> 02:01:53,369
A Jarvis Sandwich!

2819
02:01:53,606 --> 02:01:56,575
I did a lot of work about
the parents being divorced

2820
02:01:56,809 --> 02:01:58,674
and then I was going to protect
my brother,

2821
02:01:58,911 --> 02:02:01,709
that I would take care of him
emotionally,

2822
02:02:01,947 --> 02:02:04,973
and that, you know, we were
going to make it as a family

2823
02:02:05,418 --> 02:02:07,352
without my dad.

2824
02:02:07,586 --> 02:02:10,282
Trish: My parents are separated.
You know, middle-aged crazies.

2825
02:02:10,523 --> 02:02:13,583
And I do remember her doing
a lot of, kind of,

2826
02:02:13,826 --> 02:02:15,817
Iooking after me, making sure
that I was taken care of.

2827
02:02:16,062 --> 02:02:18,053
She was kind of the person

2828
02:02:18,497 --> 02:02:19,964
that I think I could probably
relate to most.

2829
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:22,390
I at least felt that it was
a real connection.

2830
02:02:22,635 --> 02:02:24,762
As much as I could bring
to that role,

2831
02:02:25,004 --> 02:02:26,835
I wanted to bring to it.

2832
02:02:27,073 --> 02:02:28,973
There was thought about making

2833
02:02:29,408 --> 02:02:32,639
the surviving characters
outsiders.

2834
02:02:32,878 --> 02:02:37,042
So Trish isn't really
one of the guys.

2835
02:02:37,483 --> 02:02:38,973
She's an outsider.

2836
02:02:39,418 --> 02:02:40,851
She's not ready to become
part of the party,

2837
02:02:41,087 --> 02:02:42,384
or the party doesn't want her.

2838
02:02:42,621 --> 02:02:44,418
Tommy's an outsider,
like Jason.

2839
02:02:44,657 --> 02:02:46,591
Tommy's a kid
that doesn't fit in.

2840
02:02:46,826 --> 02:02:48,589
I argue that one of the reasons
Tommy Jarvis

2841
02:02:48,828 --> 02:02:50,090
has been as popular as he's been

2842
02:02:50,529 --> 02:02:52,724
is because that was a very
relatable character

2843
02:02:52,965 --> 02:02:54,762
to the core audience
in these movies

2844
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,594
that they could very easily
see themselves in

2845
02:02:57,837 --> 02:02:59,998
and ultimately sort of
the challenges that he has,

2846
02:03:00,439 --> 02:03:02,407
the kind of outsider kid
who's a little bit freaky.

2847
02:03:02,641 --> 02:03:05,474
He's got hobbies that maybe not
everybody approves of per se.

2848
02:03:05,711 --> 02:03:08,578
At a roadside cemetery,
the gravesite of Mrs. Voorhees,

2849
02:03:08,814 --> 02:03:12,978
and her first name, are revealed
for the first time ever.

2850
02:03:13,419 --> 02:03:15,114
I found out her name
was Pamela,

2851
02:03:15,554 --> 02:03:17,784
I guess about 1 0 years
after I did the film.

2852
02:03:18,023 --> 02:03:19,752
I didn't know.

2853
02:03:19,992 --> 02:03:24,122
Of course we were aware putting
a mother character in the film

2854
02:03:24,563 --> 02:03:29,933
that fans who knew "Part 1 "
would think about that.

2855
02:03:30,169 --> 02:03:33,935
That idea of Joe giving me
a hint

2856
02:03:34,173 --> 02:03:36,539
that maybe
I should look sinister

2857
02:03:36,776 --> 02:03:38,004
when I looked out the window

2858
02:03:38,444 --> 02:03:40,435
because of the mother
being the one

2859
02:03:40,679 --> 02:03:42,044
that did the killing in one of
the other movies.

2860
02:03:42,481 --> 02:03:44,915
Never occurred to me.

2861
02:03:45,151 --> 02:03:46,675
Never occurred to Joe,
I don't think,

2862
02:03:46,919 --> 02:03:48,079
or he certainly didn't
tell me that.

2863
02:03:48,521 --> 02:03:50,386
We didn't play it hard, and we
didn't try to suggest

2864
02:03:50,623 --> 02:03:51,647
that she was going to be
a villain,

2865
02:03:51,891 --> 02:03:53,415
but she does make a judgment
on these kids,

2866
02:03:53,659 --> 02:03:55,991
and it feels like these kids
are going to bring

2867
02:03:56,429 --> 02:03:59,796
trouble and bad stuff
onto my kids.

2868
02:04:00,032 --> 02:04:02,023
And, of course,
she's completely right.

2869
02:04:02,468 --> 02:04:04,959
With the events
of "The Final Chapter"

2870
02:04:05,204 --> 02:04:07,172
picking up directly
after PART 2 and 3,

2871
02:04:07,606 --> 02:04:09,836
fans have pointed out
a number of holes

2872
02:04:10,075 --> 02:04:12,839
in the series' continuity
and timeline.

2873
02:04:13,078 --> 02:04:15,512
My character, Rob,
had a sister named Sandra

2874
02:04:15,748 --> 02:04:18,512
who was a counselor
at Crystal Lake

2875
02:04:18,751 --> 02:04:20,946
in Part 2, I think.

2876
02:04:21,187 --> 02:04:25,749
ROB: My sister Sandra was just
a really great kid.

2877
02:04:25,991 --> 02:04:27,754
TRlSH: But the man
that killed your sister is dead.

2878
02:04:27,993 --> 02:04:32,089
We butt up against
Friday 3 in chronology,

2879
02:04:32,531 --> 02:04:34,522
yet Rob is doing some stuff
that he hasn't been doing

2880
02:04:34,767 --> 02:04:36,064
since just a couple
of days ago.

2881
02:04:36,502 --> 02:04:37,696
When I read it,

2882
02:04:37,937 --> 02:04:39,029
I did not
connect that character

2883
02:04:39,472 --> 02:04:40,700
with someone who had died
the same day

2884
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:42,840
or the day before
or a few days before.

2885
02:04:43,075 --> 02:04:45,043
So I assumed
Rob had been searching

2886
02:04:45,478 --> 02:04:47,810
for a longer time than it turns
out he was actually searching.

2887
02:04:48,047 --> 02:04:49,480
TRlSH: What are you
hunting for up here?.

2888
02:04:49,715 --> 02:04:53,014
ROB: Bear.
Anybody up at the lake today?.

2889
02:04:53,252 --> 02:04:55,516
TOMMY: You can't be
hunting for bear.

2890
02:04:55,754 --> 02:04:58,188
Zito said he didn't want to
invent really cool new ways

2891
02:04:58,624 --> 02:04:59,989
to kill kids,
although we eventually did.

2892
02:05:00,226 --> 02:05:02,820
He said, "All I want you to do

2893
02:05:03,062 --> 02:05:04,996
is make real kids
that look like real kids

2894
02:05:05,231 --> 02:05:07,495
and whatever we do to them
will be horrifying."

2895
02:05:07,733 --> 02:05:09,758
It would be nice to make them
so likeable

2896
02:05:10,002 --> 02:05:11,833
that you were sorry
when they got killed.

2897
02:05:12,071 --> 02:05:13,197
I wanted the kids
to be a little more real,

2898
02:05:13,639 --> 02:05:17,166
and it took a lot of pain
in casting for that.

2899
02:05:17,610 --> 02:05:23,048
It was not an easy piece
to bring in "the names."

2900
02:05:23,282 --> 02:05:24,874
That's not what
'Friday the 1 3th' was about.

2901
02:05:25,117 --> 02:05:27,142
I got lucky.

2902
02:05:27,586 --> 02:05:29,076
The people
who were really the stars

2903
02:05:29,522 --> 02:05:32,252
were Peter Barton who had just
come off a series

2904
02:05:32,691 --> 02:05:34,249
called "Powers of Matthew Star."

2905
02:05:34,693 --> 02:05:38,094
and the other one
was Lawrence Monoson

2906
02:05:38,531 --> 02:05:39,725
who had starred
in "The Last American Virgin."

2907
02:05:39,965 --> 02:05:42,490
I've been lucky in the sense

2908
02:05:42,735 --> 02:05:44,862
that I've had certain roles
throughout my career,

2909
02:05:45,104 --> 02:05:48,631
part of these legacy franchises,

2910
02:05:48,874 --> 02:05:50,865
and this is certainly
one of them,

2911
02:05:51,110 --> 02:05:55,240
and it's nice to be
a little part of a big thing.

2912
02:05:55,681 --> 02:05:57,740
Arguably one of the most
memorable victims

2913
02:05:57,983 --> 02:05:59,610
in the 'Friday the 1 3th' series

2914
02:05:59,852 --> 02:06:01,114
was Crispin Glover's
sex-starved,

2915
02:06:01,554 --> 02:06:03,522
yet hopelessly insecure, Jimmy.

2916
02:06:03,756 --> 02:06:05,087
The film marked the beginning
of a long career

2917
02:06:05,324 --> 02:06:06,723
for the young artist,

2918
02:06:06,959 --> 02:06:08,654
who became known for his wildly
eccentric behavior,

2919
02:06:08,894 --> 02:06:11,192
both on and off camera.

2920
02:06:11,630 --> 02:06:13,530
Crispin Glover and l
had a love fest.

2921
02:06:13,766 --> 02:06:15,233
I adored him.

2922
02:06:15,668 --> 02:06:19,229
He was the most unique
young man that...

2923
02:06:19,672 --> 02:06:22,641
he just really--you couldn't
pigeonhole him at all.

2924
02:06:22,875 --> 02:06:25,309
On the set,
he was always the oddball.

2925
02:06:25,744 --> 02:06:27,041
He was always the one
that kept to himself.

2926
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:28,143
He was always the one that
was kind of like

2927
02:06:28,581 --> 02:06:30,071
in his own little world.

2928
02:06:30,316 --> 02:06:32,181
He's an eccentric.
He's mysterious.

2929
02:06:32,618 --> 02:06:36,884
But he just walks to the beat
of a different drum.

2930
02:06:37,122 --> 02:06:39,613
Crispin and I actually worked
really hard on our characters

2931
02:06:39,858 --> 02:06:40,722
and the relationship.

2932
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:43,155
And we both loved improv.

2933
02:06:43,596 --> 02:06:45,587
He thinks that's funny.

2934
02:06:45,831 --> 02:06:46,923
He thinks it's a funny thing
he's doing.

2935
02:06:47,166 --> 02:06:49,726
And that stuff
in the back of the van

2936
02:06:49,969 --> 02:06:52,062
when we're all driving,
and I'm typing on the beer cans

2937
02:06:52,304 --> 02:06:54,636
and the "dead fuck" lines.

2938
02:06:54,873 --> 02:06:56,033
TED: It says
you're a dead fuck.

2939
02:06:56,275 --> 02:06:58,106
JlMMY: A dead fuck?.

2940
02:06:58,344 --> 02:07:00,073
Crispin and I made all that up,
you know,

2941
02:07:00,312 --> 02:07:02,940
and they just let us
have fun with it.

2942
02:07:03,182 --> 02:07:05,241
The two of them together
really had a great thing going,

2943
02:07:05,684 --> 02:07:07,777
a really good rapport.

2944
02:07:08,020 --> 02:07:09,954
I think you should run that
through your little computer.

2945
02:07:10,189 --> 02:07:13,590
And they were pretty
good buddies on that set

2946
02:07:13,826 --> 02:07:15,020
and it did show.

2947
02:07:15,260 --> 02:07:16,921
It showed a relationship.

2948
02:07:17,162 --> 02:07:19,221
I think that's so important
in these films

2949
02:07:19,665 --> 02:07:21,895
to have that.

2950
02:07:22,134 --> 02:07:24,762
In one of the film's more
memorable sequences,

2951
02:07:25,004 --> 02:07:27,802
Jimmy decides to bust out
his dance moves.

2952
02:07:28,040 --> 02:07:31,032
I don't remember what song
Crispin was really dancing to.

2953
02:07:31,276 --> 02:07:36,111
I just know that he was
dancing really crazy. (laughs)

2954
02:07:36,348 --> 02:07:38,942
In the way that only
Crispin could be.

2955
02:07:39,184 --> 02:07:43,245
And it was just fun. It was
just really fun and funny.

2956
02:07:43,689 --> 02:07:45,782
There's slightly the weirdest
thing about our roles

2957
02:07:46,025 --> 02:07:47,754
which would first be
the sexy girls

2958
02:07:47,993 --> 02:07:50,188
who were sort of coming,
you know, from,

2959
02:07:50,429 --> 02:07:52,192
to join in with this other group
of people,

2960
02:07:52,431 --> 02:07:54,865
and all the boys are madly
attracted to us,

2961
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:57,193
and we're dressed in these
ghastly clothes!

2962
02:07:57,436 --> 02:07:59,063
Well, what about our hair
as well.

2963
02:07:59,304 --> 02:08:01,101
Our hair put up in sort of
little sort of librarian buns.

2964
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:03,706
I mean, and the pants
seemed to be too big.

2965
02:08:03,942 --> 02:08:07,173
Everything was just sort of big
and bulky and very unsexy.

2966
02:08:07,413 --> 02:08:10,075
Yeah, I wouldn't bonk
either of us.

2967
02:08:10,315 --> 02:08:14,217
The twins, you know, they were
the Doublemint twins

2968
02:08:14,453 --> 02:08:17,945
and they were loads of fun.

2969
02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:20,750
The biggest thing for me
was boobies!

2970
02:08:20,993 --> 02:08:23,018
You know,
I was an 11 -year-old boy.

2971
02:08:23,262 --> 02:08:23,990
I'm like, I get to do scenes
with boobies.

2972
02:08:24,229 --> 02:08:25,389
Whoa.

2973
02:08:25,831 --> 02:08:27,958
Not much has changed.

2974
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:30,327
I have to say the skinny
dipping was very equal

2975
02:08:30,769 --> 02:08:32,066
because when we
were shooting it,

2976
02:08:32,304 --> 02:08:34,704
we obviously as girls
had to have no tops on,

2977
02:08:34,940 --> 02:08:36,669
but then the boys go,

2978
02:08:36,909 --> 02:08:38,274
'We'll do it
with no bottoms on as well,'

2979
02:08:38,711 --> 02:08:40,804
and there they are
swinging off ropes.

2980
02:08:41,046 --> 02:08:42,206
So, you know,
it was a cute group

2981
02:08:42,448 --> 02:08:44,177
to work with, that's for sure.

2982
02:08:44,416 --> 02:08:47,146
At the time,
I was the kid who was like

2983
02:08:47,386 --> 02:08:48,876
always wanting to get up in
everybody's business.

2984
02:08:49,121 --> 02:08:49,985
I was like,
"Hey, let's all go out.

2985
02:08:50,222 --> 02:08:51,849
Let's go do this.

2986
02:08:52,091 --> 02:08:52,853
What do you mean you're all
going to town without me?.

2987
02:08:53,092 --> 02:08:54,957
Why can't I come too?. "

2988
02:08:55,194 --> 02:08:56,889
I mean, like, I really wanted
to be a part of that group.

2989
02:08:57,129 --> 02:08:59,723
The first day
was Halloween actually,

2990
02:08:59,965 --> 02:09:02,229
and I took him
trick-or- treating.

2991
02:09:02,468 --> 02:09:03,730
And we went out on the street,

2992
02:09:03,969 --> 02:09:07,166
and this street was like
a festival

2993
02:09:07,406 --> 02:09:09,340
of guys in Jason's masks.

2994
02:09:09,775 --> 02:09:11,743
So ironic that we were there
actually creating this stuff

2995
02:09:11,977 --> 02:09:13,911
and then this group of people

2996
02:09:14,146 --> 02:09:17,274
were actually out there
having a great time with it.

2997
02:09:17,516 --> 02:09:20,451
I think everybody was very
sweet to Corey Feldman.

2998
02:09:20,886 --> 02:09:22,945
I remember getting along
with everybody on that set.

2999
02:09:23,188 --> 02:09:26,055
The only person that I didn't
get along with

3000
02:09:26,291 --> 02:09:28,759
or was afraid of was Ted White.

3001
02:09:28,994 --> 02:09:31,189
Mean little devil.
I couldn't stand him.

3002
02:09:31,430 --> 02:09:33,955
I wanted to kill him
desperately.

3003
02:09:34,199 --> 02:09:37,100
There were times when Corey
got close to me

3004
02:09:37,336 --> 02:09:40,203
that it took all my reserve
to not just reach out

3005
02:09:40,439 --> 02:09:42,031
and grab him and give him
a good spanking.

3006
02:09:42,274 --> 02:09:44,902
Ted was very respectful when it
came to the fact

3007
02:09:45,144 --> 02:09:46,372
that I was a kid, and he knew
to keep his boundaries.

3008
02:09:46,812 --> 02:09:48,473
But at the same time

3009
02:09:48,914 --> 02:09:49,881
I don't think that he was really
very aware

3010
02:09:50,115 --> 02:09:51,139
of how to deal with children.

3011
02:09:51,383 --> 02:09:52,941
Well, I was a child actor

3012
02:09:53,185 --> 02:09:55,119
so I had a lot in common
with him.

3013
02:09:55,354 --> 02:09:59,120
It's a hard, a hard thing,
a lot of your... I mean,

3014
02:09:59,358 --> 02:10:00,450
you miss a lot
of your childhood.

3015
02:10:00,893 --> 02:10:04,056
You could see there was
a dark side to Corey.

3016
02:10:04,296 --> 02:10:09,097
Not bad but wanting to stay
with the actors

3017
02:10:09,334 --> 02:10:12,132
as opposed to getting in the car
and going home

3018
02:10:12,371 --> 02:10:15,238
to the so-called "real life"
that he was living.

3019
02:10:15,474 --> 02:10:19,274
Frank Mancuso, Jr. was quite
helpful keeping him together

3020
02:10:19,511 --> 02:10:21,103
and happy.

3021
02:10:21,346 --> 02:10:24,110
Even after the movies,
you know, Frank,

3022
02:10:24,349 --> 02:10:26,044
we all stayed in touch
with Corey.

3023
02:10:26,285 --> 02:10:29,049
As with Part 3, the filmmakers
chose rural areas

3024
02:10:29,288 --> 02:10:31,085
of Southern California
to stand in

3025
02:10:31,323 --> 02:10:33,154
for the fictional New Jersey
enclave of Crystal Lake.

3026
02:10:33,392 --> 02:10:37,089
We shot
in three different places,

3027
02:10:37,329 --> 02:10:39,797
Franklin Canyon
in Beverly Hills,

3028
02:10:40,032 --> 02:10:42,023
north of Santa Barbara
in a place called Zaca Lake,

3029
02:10:42,267 --> 02:10:45,134
and in Topanga Canyon.

3030
02:10:45,370 --> 02:10:47,133
The Jarvis house
would later be featured

3031
02:10:47,372 --> 02:10:50,569
in such films as
"Eraser," "My Girl 2,"

3032
02:10:51,009 --> 02:10:53,375
and episodes of the HBO series
"Entourage."

3033
02:10:53,612 --> 02:10:56,547
But for the cast
of "The Final Chapter,"

3034
02:10:56,982 --> 02:11:00,179
working on the set presented a
number of physical challenges.

3035
02:11:00,419 --> 02:11:02,478
And we're at the house
where we shot the movie.

3036
02:11:02,921 --> 02:11:05,446
Tommy's room was up there
on the second floor.

3037
02:11:05,891 --> 02:11:06,823
And the kids' house
is over here, right?.

3038
02:11:07,059 --> 02:11:08,526
The kids' house
was right over here.

3039
02:11:08,961 --> 02:11:11,054
We built the kids' house, the
house where they have the party,

3040
02:11:11,296 --> 02:11:13,423
and the house where they
get killed, right over here.

3041
02:11:13,866 --> 02:11:17,267
It was my idea, and I don't mind
telling you

3042
02:11:17,502 --> 02:11:19,470
the studio objected a lot

3043
02:11:19,905 --> 02:11:22,305
to have the houses
in real proximity.

3044
02:11:22,541 --> 02:11:24,031
See, the thing is when we built
this other house,

3045
02:11:24,276 --> 02:11:26,005
it was an expensive
thing to do,

3046
02:11:26,245 --> 02:11:28,110
building a house as opposed
to finding two houses,

3047
02:11:28,347 --> 02:11:30,611
but we really loved
the Jarvis house.

3048
02:11:31,049 --> 02:11:33,108
I really loved the Jarvis house,
and I really pushed for it.

3049
02:11:33,352 --> 02:11:35,377
So the studio agreed to build
this other house here.

3050
02:11:35,621 --> 02:11:38,181
But the thing is
that we had a design for it

3051
02:11:38,423 --> 02:11:40,550
where it was a really good house
to shoot in, a big house,

3052
02:11:40,993 --> 02:11:42,255
but as they started
doing the numbers

3053
02:11:42,494 --> 02:11:43,518
and analyzing the numbers,

3054
02:11:43,962 --> 02:11:46,123
the house got
smaller and smaller

3055
02:11:46,365 --> 02:11:47,263
so in the end it wasn't a great
house to shoot in,

3056
02:11:47,499 --> 02:11:48,989
but it was a cool-looking house.

3057
02:11:49,234 --> 02:11:51,202
The young people
we had in the cast

3058
02:11:51,436 --> 02:11:53,199
were some of the greatest kids
that I've ever worked with,

3059
02:11:53,438 --> 02:11:55,099
and I've worked with a lot of
young kids in the business.

3060
02:11:55,340 --> 02:11:57,001
But what they went through
to make this movie

3061
02:11:57,242 --> 02:11:59,005
was unbelievable.

3062
02:11:59,244 --> 02:12:02,145
Shooting the movie was pretty
horrible

3063
02:12:02,381 --> 02:12:04,076
because it was raining
the whole time,

3064
02:12:04,316 --> 02:12:08,582
and it was freezing cold
because it was dead winter.

3065
02:12:09,021 --> 02:12:11,421
I didn't read the script
when I got the job,

3066
02:12:11,657 --> 02:12:13,090
and I didn't read the last
40 pages of the script

3067
02:12:13,325 --> 02:12:15,418
said night rain.

3068
02:12:15,661 --> 02:12:16,889
ROB: What the hell
are you doing here?.

3069
02:12:17,129 --> 02:12:18,619
TRlSH: What are you
trying to do, kill me?.

3070
02:12:19,064 --> 02:12:20,122
What I remember the most
about those steps right there

3071
02:12:20,365 --> 02:12:22,265
is that for continuity's sake

3072
02:12:22,501 --> 02:12:25,470
at the end of the movie,
I had to be wet

3073
02:12:25,704 --> 02:12:26,295
because it was raining
all the time,

3074
02:12:26,538 --> 02:12:28,438
so in 35-degree weather,

3075
02:12:28,674 --> 02:12:32,405
I was hosed down with water
from a tank

3076
02:12:32,644 --> 02:12:34,635
that was sitting outside
in 35-degree weather.

3077
02:12:35,080 --> 02:12:36,911
Just unbelievable what they
went through

3078
02:12:37,149 --> 02:12:37,945
for the amount of money
they were making.

3079
02:12:38,183 --> 02:12:41,243
It was, it was a trial
in a good way.

3080
02:12:41,486 --> 02:12:43,920
I felt like a Marine
after it was over.

3081
02:12:44,156 --> 02:12:47,182
Once again, the real stars
of this 'Friday the 1 3th"

3082
02:12:47,426 --> 02:12:49,519
were the elaborate
death sequences

3083
02:12:49,962 --> 02:12:52,260
designed by effects wunderkind
Tom Savini.

3084
02:12:52,497 --> 02:12:55,057
I had done a movie
called "The Prowler."

3085
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:57,564
It was mostly a lot
of special effects,

3086
02:12:58,003 --> 02:12:59,630
really good Tom Savini
special effects.

3087
02:13:00,072 --> 02:13:01,266
I think that's what audiences
came to see.

3088
02:13:01,506 --> 02:13:03,406
How is the next guy
going to get it?.

3089
02:13:03,642 --> 02:13:05,007
So that's what it was about.

3090
02:13:05,243 --> 02:13:07,040
And it was almost like
the latest exhibit

3091
02:13:07,279 --> 02:13:10,544
from your favorite
makeup artist magician.

3092
02:13:10,983 --> 02:13:13,076
How is Jason
going to kill these kids?.

3093
02:13:13,318 --> 02:13:15,445
So we spent a lot of time
talking about

3094
02:13:15,687 --> 02:13:17,518
how to kill people
in interesting ways.

3095
02:13:17,756 --> 02:13:19,121
And that's the number one thing
you do with Savini

3096
02:13:19,358 --> 02:13:20,256
because it's his favorite thing
in the world to do,

3097
02:13:20,492 --> 02:13:22,323
is talk about
how to kill things.

3098
02:13:22,561 --> 02:13:27,430
This just kind of crazy mind
that was always creating.

3099
02:13:27,666 --> 02:13:29,258
It was a terrific honor
to work with Tom

3100
02:13:29,501 --> 02:13:30,729
and especially to be a part

3101
02:13:31,169 --> 02:13:33,467
of one of his last great
effects films.

3102
02:13:33,705 --> 02:13:37,072
The choice of name for
the character of the kid Tommy

3103
02:13:37,309 --> 02:13:39,072
was a little homage
to Tom Savini

3104
02:13:39,311 --> 02:13:41,211
who contributed so much
to these pictures.

3105
02:13:41,446 --> 02:13:43,471
I was really kind of fascinated
with the process

3106
02:13:43,715 --> 02:13:44,682
of how this was all going
to be put together

3107
02:13:45,117 --> 02:13:46,516
at some point

3108
02:13:46,752 --> 02:13:49,016
and so I used to hang out
in Tom's trailer all the time

3109
02:13:49,254 --> 02:13:51,119
and watch them do the rehearsals
for the different effects.

3110
02:13:51,356 --> 02:13:54,519
(Laughter)

3111
02:13:54,760 --> 02:13:56,387
The kids would come up to us.

3112
02:13:56,628 --> 02:13:57,617
"How am I going to die?.
How am I going to die?. "

3113
02:13:58,063 --> 02:14:00,054
The juicier and grosser it was,

3114
02:14:00,298 --> 02:14:02,027
the more they loved it,
you know?.

3115
02:14:02,267 --> 02:14:04,394
And even the kills that had
conventional things.

3116
02:14:04,636 --> 02:14:06,035
Because we had seen in
"Friday the 1 3th"

3117
02:14:06,271 --> 02:14:09,570
a blade coming through
the throat before,

3118
02:14:09,808 --> 02:14:10,467
right, from the first one.

3119
02:14:10,709 --> 02:14:12,609
So we gave the girl a banana.

3120
02:14:13,045 --> 02:14:17,778
Mmm. I love bananas.

3121
02:14:18,216 --> 02:14:21,014
It's sort of a comedic kill
in a way

3122
02:14:21,253 --> 02:14:23,687
and a comedic character,
but it's awful anyway.

3123
02:14:24,122 --> 02:14:25,214
I mean, the blade
comes through her neck,

3124
02:14:25,457 --> 02:14:26,788
but you're sort of watching
her squish the banana.

3125
02:14:27,225 --> 02:14:29,284
I never really met Ted White
who played Jason.

3126
02:14:29,528 --> 02:14:32,395
Tom Savini stood in for him

3127
02:14:32,631 --> 02:14:35,122
because you only see Jason
from the waist down.

3128
02:14:35,367 --> 02:14:36,732
He's the one
that grabbed my head.

3129
02:14:37,169 --> 02:14:38,534
He's the one that pulled
the knife down.

3130
02:14:38,770 --> 02:14:42,103
And the direction
he gave me was,

3131
02:14:42,340 --> 02:14:44,240
'Okay, now this is a real knife.

3132
02:14:44,476 --> 02:14:45,568
You're not going to get hurt.

3133
02:14:45,811 --> 02:14:47,802
Don't fight me,
just let me move your head

3134
02:14:48,246 --> 02:14:49,645
where it needs to be.

3135
02:14:50,082 --> 02:14:51,481
That was the scariest thing
of the whole shoot for me.

3136
02:14:51,716 --> 02:14:54,207
The way the thing worked,

3137
02:14:54,453 --> 02:14:57,479
I had a track around my neck
with a flexible steel blade

3138
02:14:57,722 --> 02:14:59,246
that pushed from the back

3139
02:14:59,491 --> 02:15:01,220
and then a false neck over it,

3140
02:15:01,460 --> 02:15:03,428
which took hours to put on it.

3141
02:15:03,662 --> 02:15:05,687
And it also had a little tube
for blood to squirt.

3142
02:15:06,131 --> 02:15:09,567
So there were like 3 people
behind me um, um,

3143
02:15:09,801 --> 02:15:11,359
Iaying down behind
the sleeping bags

3144
02:15:11,603 --> 02:15:14,595
and my gear
to work the entire thing.

3145
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:16,398
It was such a messy
little death.

3146
02:15:16,641 --> 02:15:19,075
We did full-on special effects

3147
02:15:19,311 --> 02:15:20,801
that were extended
and bloodletting

3148
02:15:21,246 --> 02:15:22,577
and actually terrific.

3149
02:15:22,814 --> 02:15:25,146
I mean,
the one of Judie Aronson

3150
02:15:25,383 --> 02:15:26,145
when she's killed in the boat

3151
02:15:26,384 --> 02:15:27,817
with the knife coming through
her body.

3152
02:15:28,253 --> 02:15:32,155
I mean, the original cut on that
was really totally cool.

3153
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:34,858
I mean, it was extended,
it was horrible to watch

3154
02:15:35,293 --> 02:15:36,624
because you really believed
she was dying in there

3155
02:15:36,862 --> 02:15:39,126
and in pain for
an extended period of time.

3156
02:15:39,364 --> 02:15:41,628
Sam, Judie Arsonson, thank God
I didn't get that role,

3157
02:15:41,867 --> 02:15:44,734
'cause what she
had to go through but,

3158
02:15:45,170 --> 02:15:48,697
all naked on a raft,
and then just, very vulnerable.

3159
02:15:49,141 --> 02:15:51,666
Kind of almost quasi-sexual.

3160
02:15:51,910 --> 02:15:53,400
Even now as I watch it,
I just think, ew, God.

3161
02:15:53,645 --> 02:15:58,344
[screams]

3162
02:15:58,583 --> 02:16:01,381
Shooting my death scene
was a bit of a challenge.

3163
02:16:01,620 --> 02:16:05,784
That's where the horror part
came into the filming for me.

3164
02:16:06,224 --> 02:16:08,658
What they did was they made
a fake body.

3165
02:16:08,894 --> 02:16:11,556
There was a raft with a hole
cut in it,

3166
02:16:11,796 --> 02:16:15,323
and my body
went through the hole.

3167
02:16:15,567 --> 02:16:19,526
I was upright in the water and
from here up,

3168
02:16:19,771 --> 02:16:22,672
I was just leaning over.

3169
02:16:22,908 --> 02:16:27,174
I think this was in January,
and it was around midnight

3170
02:16:27,412 --> 02:16:30,381
and it was either
22 or 23 degrees.

3171
02:16:30,615 --> 02:16:32,549
It was very, very cold.

3172
02:16:32,784 --> 02:16:35,844
And we were all sitting there
bundled up, gloves, boots.

3173
02:16:36,288 --> 02:16:39,780
It was very, very cold,
and the water was even colder.

3174
02:16:40,225 --> 02:16:42,386
It was hours and hours
in the water.

3175
02:16:42,627 --> 02:16:45,425
And it became
really difficult for me.

3176
02:16:45,664 --> 02:16:46,631
There were points where I just
felt like

3177
02:16:46,865 --> 02:16:48,765
I couldn't go on any more.

3178
02:16:49,201 --> 02:16:50,634
I was shivering so badly.

3179
02:16:50,869 --> 02:16:53,337
She was freezing.

3180
02:16:53,572 --> 02:16:54,766
She was so cold
her teeth were chattering,

3181
02:16:55,207 --> 02:16:56,731
and she asked to get out,

3182
02:16:56,975 --> 02:16:58,237
and they were reloading
the camera

3183
02:16:58,476 --> 02:17:01,343
and the director said no.

3184
02:17:01,580 --> 02:17:02,478
They said,
"No, we have to finish.

3185
02:17:02,714 --> 02:17:04,341
We have to finish."

3186
02:17:04,583 --> 02:17:07,575
I did everything to hold back
from crying,

3187
02:17:07,819 --> 02:17:09,309
and I don't think
I was successful.

3188
02:17:09,554 --> 02:17:10,748
This girl was actually
turning blue,

3189
02:17:10,989 --> 02:17:13,253
and I went to Joe Zito
and told him.

3190
02:17:13,491 --> 02:17:15,425
I said, "Joe,
we gotta get her out of there

3191
02:17:15,660 --> 02:17:17,218
before she freezes up
completely."

3192
02:17:17,462 --> 02:17:19,589
And he said,
"Why don't you just do Jason

3193
02:17:19,831 --> 02:17:20,957
and I'll do the direct."

3194
02:17:21,399 --> 02:17:22,798
So that's when I got
a little upset with him.

3195
02:17:23,235 --> 02:17:23,894
I said, "Well, either
get her out, or I'll walk.

3196
02:17:24,336 --> 02:17:26,634
One or the other."
So they pulled her out.

3197
02:17:26,871 --> 02:17:29,465
They took me into a trailer
and heated me up

3198
02:17:29,708 --> 02:17:31,903
and got me back out there.

3199
02:17:32,344 --> 02:17:33,641
And it was great.

3200
02:17:33,878 --> 02:17:35,743
I warmed up,
thawed out basically.

3201
02:17:35,981 --> 02:17:38,415
Joe, of course,
was not trying to be mean.

3202
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:40,914
He was trying
to get a film made.

3203
02:17:41,353 --> 02:17:46,381
Whether he was going
a little too far

3204
02:17:46,625 --> 02:17:50,493
with somebody else's feelings,
I would say yes.

3205
02:17:50,729 --> 02:17:54,563
And it turns out that I had
gotten hypothermia,

3206
02:17:54,799 --> 02:17:58,394
and I was quite sick
for several days after that.

3207
02:17:58,637 --> 02:18:01,299
The other gruesome one
really is, you know,

3208
02:18:01,539 --> 02:18:03,336
Sam being killed
in the boat naked

3209
02:18:03,575 --> 02:18:04,940
and then her boyfriend coming

3210
02:18:05,377 --> 02:18:07,004
out and getting it
in the crotch.

3211
02:18:07,445 --> 02:18:08,412
When you're looking, you know,
for your girlfriend in a lake,

3212
02:18:08,647 --> 02:18:09,614
and you think
she's probably naked,

3213
02:18:09,848 --> 02:18:11,509
you do not want to get speared
in the crotch.

3214
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:13,718
That is a bad thing
to happen at that moment.

3215
02:18:13,952 --> 02:18:15,920
The guys certainly feel
that one when they watch it.

3216
02:18:16,354 --> 02:18:18,379
Pretty much all the deaths
were pretty graphic and grisly,

3217
02:18:18,623 --> 02:18:20,523
but you don't see
the mother die.

3218
02:18:20,759 --> 02:18:22,351
In most of the Jason movies,

3219
02:18:22,594 --> 02:18:23,822
I think there is
no parental supervision.

3220
02:18:24,062 --> 02:18:26,428
In ours there was

3221
02:18:26,665 --> 02:18:28,860
because we thought
that made it scarier,

3222
02:18:29,301 --> 02:18:31,861
especially when the parents
were made to disappear.

3223
02:18:32,304 --> 02:18:34,397
In filming that scene

3224
02:18:34,639 --> 02:18:35,970
where you see me
come in from the rain,

3225
02:18:36,408 --> 02:18:37,636
and you see me turn around
and the shock,

3226
02:18:37,876 --> 02:18:40,970
there was no other murder
and mayhem

3227
02:18:41,413 --> 02:18:42,038
that you could put
on the screen.

3228
02:18:42,480 --> 02:18:44,744
That was it. That one point.

3229
02:18:44,983 --> 02:18:46,473
Although Mrs. Jarvis's death
was only implied,

3230
02:18:46,718 --> 02:18:48,879
a deleted scene

3231
02:18:49,321 --> 02:18:51,551
involving Trish's discovering
her mother's corpse

3232
02:18:51,790 --> 02:18:54,987
was originally intended to be
the film's final jump scare.

3233
02:18:55,427 --> 02:18:56,519
But I do remember that we
shot a scene of her

3234
02:18:56,761 --> 02:18:59,628
in the bathtub all made up
like a cadaver.

3235
02:18:59,864 --> 02:19:03,630
Kimberly comes in and she sees
water dripping down,

3236
02:19:03,868 --> 02:19:06,496
and she goes upstairs
and opens the bathroom door,

3237
02:19:06,738 --> 02:19:11,334
and you see me under the water,
in the bathtub, dead.

3238
02:19:11,576 --> 02:19:13,601
It was really intense,
that scene.

3239
02:19:13,845 --> 02:19:16,075
And I was surprised
that they left it out,

3240
02:19:16,514 --> 02:19:18,607
but I guess it was just,
it was disturbing,

3241
02:19:18,850 --> 02:19:19,976
and they didn't
want it in there.

3242
02:19:20,418 --> 02:19:21,680
It was excised
almost immediately.

3243
02:19:21,920 --> 02:19:23,012
I didn't want to dwell on it.

3244
02:19:23,455 --> 02:19:24,513
I didn't think it was good
psychologically

3245
02:19:24,756 --> 02:19:27,657
to keep-- to make more of that
than we did.

3246
02:19:27,892 --> 02:19:29,325
The main thing
about my death scene

3247
02:19:29,561 --> 02:19:31,028
was really
the sort of atmosphere,

3248
02:19:31,463 --> 02:19:33,954
it was the flashing
of the lightning,

3249
02:19:34,399 --> 02:19:37,698
and the thunder,
and the feeling of it being

3250
02:19:37,936 --> 02:19:39,460
very scary out there.

3251
02:19:39,704 --> 02:19:41,865
They put a big light
behind me

3252
02:19:42,107 --> 02:19:45,474
so that I'm silhouetted
against the side of the house,

3253
02:19:45,710 --> 02:19:47,974
and at that moment--
(Sound Effects)

3254
02:19:48,413 --> 02:19:49,903
you know the pitchfork
goes through me,

3255
02:19:50,148 --> 02:19:53,083
and I get flung
against the wall.

3256
02:19:53,518 --> 02:19:56,851
That is not me, you know.
I'm just the shadow.

3257
02:19:57,088 --> 02:19:58,817
Crispin does a whole thing
where he's so happy

3258
02:19:59,057 --> 02:20:00,046
about being successful
with this girl in bed.

3259
02:20:00,492 --> 02:20:02,084
I think you were incredible.

3260
02:20:02,527 --> 02:20:05,428
You're incredible.

3261
02:20:05,663 --> 02:20:08,826
Which is what I say in bed
to Crispin

3262
02:20:09,067 --> 02:20:12,400
when he's like uh-am-l-uh-uh.

3263
02:20:12,637 --> 02:20:14,628
Was I a dead fuck?.

3264
02:20:14,873 --> 02:20:16,067
That was quite funny.

3265
02:20:16,508 --> 02:20:19,500
People talk a lot
about the corkscrew

3266
02:20:19,744 --> 02:20:21,871
that gets Crispin Glover.

3267
02:20:22,113 --> 02:20:25,605
Hey, Ted, where the hell's
the corkscrew?.!

3268
02:20:25,850 --> 02:20:28,546
He's calling for a corkscrew
and, wham,

3269
02:20:28,787 --> 02:20:29,719
right through his hand.
The corkscrew nails him.

3270
02:20:29,954 --> 02:20:31,444
Jason's clever.
He nails him with the cork screw

3271
02:20:31,689 --> 02:20:32,678
and then machete to the face.

3272
02:20:32,924 --> 02:20:34,152
I thought that was
really creative,

3273
02:20:34,592 --> 02:20:37,026
and it came out of left field.

3274
02:20:37,462 --> 02:20:39,828
I just had an idea that we
shouldn't use a weapon at all

3275
02:20:40,064 --> 02:20:43,727
in one of the kills
with one of the twins

3276
02:20:43,968 --> 02:20:46,732
and just have this
prolonged thing

3277
02:20:46,971 --> 02:20:47,938
of her at the window

3278
02:20:48,173 --> 02:20:49,697
and the hands
come through the glass,

3279
02:20:49,941 --> 02:20:51,033
grab her and throw her out.

3280
02:20:51,476 --> 02:20:53,000
It was a pretty big stunt.

3281
02:20:53,445 --> 02:20:55,174
I actually don't know
when it's gonna happen,

3282
02:20:55,613 --> 02:20:58,047
but what I'm told is
Jason's going to come,

3283
02:20:58,483 --> 02:21:01,111
grab me and at that point,
the only thing I have to do

3284
02:21:01,553 --> 02:21:04,750
is get my neck out of the window
as it shatters.

3285
02:21:04,989 --> 02:21:06,422
After I've done that,

3286
02:21:06,658 --> 02:21:09,559
the stunt girl
has to propel herself

3287
02:21:09,794 --> 02:21:10,988
out of the window.

3288
02:21:11,229 --> 02:21:12,093
That's her first shot.

3289
02:21:12,530 --> 02:21:14,464
And she landed on a car top.

3290
02:21:14,699 --> 02:21:16,098
We blew the windows out
at the same time.

3291
02:21:16,534 --> 02:21:19,526
I thought that was
a really neat stunt

3292
02:21:19,771 --> 02:21:21,864
and was well done
and well thought-out.

3293
02:21:22,106 --> 02:21:24,700
I didn't suffer as much as
other people did, really,

3294
02:21:24,943 --> 02:21:26,672
in terms of coldness
and wetness.

3295
02:21:26,911 --> 02:21:30,176
One of the first sequences to
suffer the wrath of the MPAA

3296
02:21:30,615 --> 02:21:33,743
was the death of the cocky
yet ultimately rejected Ted,

3297
02:21:33,985 --> 02:21:35,919
who was left alone
to spend the night

3298
02:21:36,154 --> 02:21:39,749
with a blue movie,
a teddy bear, and a joint.

3299
02:21:39,991 --> 02:21:43,085
I remember in mine watching
that sort of old-fashioned,

3300
02:21:43,528 --> 02:21:47,055
semi soft-core porn movie.

3301
02:21:47,499 --> 02:21:49,660
So the film breaks,
the screen goes white.

3302
02:21:49,901 --> 02:21:50,959
Lawrence stands
in front of the screen

3303
02:21:51,202 --> 02:21:52,169
and a knife
comes through the back,

3304
02:21:52,604 --> 02:21:53,536
stabs him
in the back of the head.

3305
02:21:53,771 --> 02:21:55,170
We're not sure exactly
what happens

3306
02:21:55,607 --> 02:21:57,666
until we see the blood
on the screen as he slides down.

3307
02:21:57,909 --> 02:21:59,900
I remember at first
I had to go visit Tom Savini,

3308
02:22:00,144 --> 02:22:04,478
and I went to get
my head created.

3309
02:22:04,716 --> 02:22:07,014
Tom rigged up a knife
that was cut away

3310
02:22:07,252 --> 02:22:09,516
with a little pump
that was pumping blood,

3311
02:22:09,754 --> 02:22:11,688
and you just looked
at the dailies,

3312
02:22:11,923 --> 02:22:13,584
and it was just
horrifying to watch.

3313
02:22:13,825 --> 02:22:15,850
I was a very young actor
when I did this movie.

3314
02:22:16,094 --> 02:22:18,187
I think I was 20 or something.

3315
02:22:18,630 --> 02:22:20,655
Really committed, you know.
What are you doing?.

3316
02:22:20,899 --> 02:22:22,628
Real. Everything had to be real,

3317
02:22:22,867 --> 02:22:26,894
and so my character in the movie
had to be stoned,

3318
02:22:27,138 --> 02:22:29,834
(laughing)

3319
02:22:30,074 --> 02:22:31,769
and so I thought, hmmm,
wouldn't that be interesting

3320
02:22:32,010 --> 02:22:33,773
to actually get stoned

3321
02:22:34,012 --> 02:22:35,877
and see what that's like
to actually be stoned

3322
02:22:36,114 --> 02:22:38,105
on camera?.

3323
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:39,107
I go to my trailer,
and I'm like [sucking sound].

3324
02:22:39,551 --> 02:22:43,715
I'm smoking this joint,
and I get stoned,

3325
02:22:43,955 --> 02:22:46,947
and I'm a very
paranoid stoned person.

3326
02:22:47,191 --> 02:22:50,888
So it was the worst, worst idea
I could have ever done.

3327
02:22:51,129 --> 02:22:52,756
I was unable to comprehend
what the director was saying,

3328
02:22:52,997 --> 02:22:54,021
and I just was too paranoid
to do anything.

3329
02:22:54,265 --> 02:22:57,166
It was terrible.

3330
02:22:57,602 --> 02:22:59,160
Actor Peter Barton,
who had previously starred

3331
02:22:59,604 --> 02:23:01,231
with Linda Blair in "Hell Night"

3332
02:23:01,673 --> 02:23:03,004
and "Part 2's Amy Steel
in the short-lived series

3333
02:23:03,241 --> 02:23:06,142
"The Powers of Matthew Star."

3334
02:23:06,578 --> 02:23:08,739
suffered perhaps one of
the most brutal deaths

3335
02:23:08,980 --> 02:23:11,005
in 'Friday the 1 3th' history.

3336
02:23:11,249 --> 02:23:13,649
My hands
were my weapon of choice.

3337
02:23:13,885 --> 02:23:16,752
Once I got my hands on 'em,
the killing was easy then.

3338
02:23:16,988 --> 02:23:21,322
I mean, he smashes, you know,
a pretty guy's face

3339
02:23:21,759 --> 02:23:26,822
through the shower
with his bare hands.

3340
02:23:27,065 --> 02:23:28,657
Breaks his nose with his finger,
blood comes out,

3341
02:23:28,900 --> 02:23:31,130
and then smashes the head
against the tiles.

3342
02:23:31,369 --> 02:23:33,894
Tom said to me,
'Don't tear the head up.

3343
02:23:34,138 --> 02:23:35,901
This is the only one we've got.
Be very careful with it.'

3344
02:23:36,140 --> 02:23:37,334
Yet the director
was just the opposite.

3345
02:23:37,775 --> 02:23:39,208
He said, 'Ted, I want you

3346
02:23:39,644 --> 02:23:40,770
to really be physical
with this thing.'

3347
02:23:41,012 --> 02:23:41,979
That was the whole reason
for having a stuntman in there,

3348
02:23:42,213 --> 02:23:43,942
to be a little more physical.

3349
02:23:44,182 --> 02:23:45,706
To me, that probably
was my favorite kill.

3350
02:23:45,950 --> 02:23:48,248
To truly immerse himself
in the role of Jason,

3351
02:23:48,686 --> 02:23:51,211
Ted White took great pains

3352
02:23:51,656 --> 02:23:52,748
to keep his fellow cast members
at bay.

3353
02:23:52,991 --> 02:23:56,950
I think his way
of keeping the character

3354
02:23:57,195 --> 02:23:59,220
was kind of separating himself
from everybody else.

3355
02:23:59,664 --> 02:24:00,892
I stayed away from the cast
completely.

3356
02:24:01,132 --> 02:24:03,157
I sat by myself on the set.

3357
02:24:03,401 --> 02:24:05,733
I just stayed away
from everybody,

3358
02:24:05,970 --> 02:24:08,734
and I tried to keep in character
as much as possible.

3359
02:24:08,973 --> 02:24:12,204
I just felt that Jason
should not be sitting there

3360
02:24:12,644 --> 02:24:14,703
Iaughing and cutting up
and kidding,

3361
02:24:14,946 --> 02:24:17,278
and the next minute turn into
this horrible killer.

3362
02:24:17,715 --> 02:24:18,340
As the night of murderous mayhem
comes to a close,

3363
02:24:18,783 --> 02:24:22,981
Trish and Rob are drawn into
the empty house

3364
02:24:23,221 --> 02:24:27,214
and Jason claims his last,
though bloodless, kill.

3365
02:24:27,659 --> 02:24:30,651
He's killing me!
He's killing me!

3366
02:24:30,895 --> 02:24:32,328
The 'he's killing me,
he's killing me' thing,

3367
02:24:32,764 --> 02:24:35,289
that was something that I just
reacted to viscerally

3368
02:24:35,733 --> 02:24:37,325
as it was happening.

3369
02:24:37,769 --> 02:24:38,997
That's sort of why
it wasn't necessary

3370
02:24:39,237 --> 02:24:41,296
to do a big, bloody, gory kill

3371
02:24:41,739 --> 02:24:43,070
because it wasn't really
about the kill.

3372
02:24:43,307 --> 02:24:46,208
it was about the horror
of hearing someone being killed.

3373
02:24:46,444 --> 02:24:48,275
They had the rig
for this effect.

3374
02:24:48,713 --> 02:24:51,739
They had the gardening tool
with the blood spurting out.

3375
02:24:51,983 --> 02:24:53,348
They had all that stuff done,
but it was never used.

3376
02:24:53,785 --> 02:24:55,013
And when Rob is getting killed,

3377
02:24:55,253 --> 02:24:57,278
Trish should get out of there,

3378
02:24:57,722 --> 02:24:58,154
and then she does
get out of there,

3379
02:24:58,389 --> 02:25:00,823
and then she comes back.

3380
02:25:01,059 --> 02:25:03,186
Part of that was, I think,
in the story making

3381
02:25:03,428 --> 02:25:05,988
was to get to the point
where now you were left

3382
02:25:06,230 --> 02:25:08,289
with a 1 2-year-old kid
and Kimberly Beck,

3383
02:25:08,733 --> 02:25:14,137
and that's all
that was left alive.

3384
02:25:14,372 --> 02:25:17,808
The last part of it, we pretty
much shot it in sequence.

3385
02:25:18,042 --> 02:25:20,840
The sequence involved
Erich Anderson's character

3386
02:25:21,079 --> 02:25:22,671
being thrown through the window.

3387
02:25:22,914 --> 02:25:24,381
Jason comes and picks me up
through the window

3388
02:25:24,816 --> 02:25:26,750
and scares the hell out of me

3389
02:25:26,984 --> 02:25:29,350
which still to this day
was the most terrifying thing

3390
02:25:29,787 --> 02:25:31,778
I've ever
shot in my life - ever.

3391
02:25:32,023 --> 02:25:35,254
Terror struck
across my face, my heart,

3392
02:25:35,493 --> 02:25:38,189
my every nerve
in my body was on end.

3393
02:25:38,429 --> 02:25:42,957
And I literally was shaking
and crying in terror.

3394
02:25:43,201 --> 02:25:45,965
And I remember once we cut
and that take was over,

3395
02:25:46,204 --> 02:25:48,069
everybody took me outside,
"Are you okay?. Are you okay??"'

3396
02:25:48,306 --> 02:25:50,831
"No! No, I'm not okay."

3397
02:25:51,075 --> 02:25:53,202
I was not okay, and I was not
okay for quite a while.

3398
02:25:53,444 --> 02:25:55,412
I enjoyed chasing the girl.

3399
02:25:55,847 --> 02:25:56,939
I love the screaming
and all the hollering.

3400
02:25:57,181 --> 02:25:58,170
All it did was invigorate me.

3401
02:25:58,416 --> 02:26:02,182
It was just grueling physically.

3402
02:26:02,420 --> 02:26:03,478
Well, the stopping
and the starting,

3403
02:26:03,921 --> 02:26:05,445
and the cat and mouse
with the girl

3404
02:26:05,890 --> 02:26:07,380
was not my idea or her idea.

3405
02:26:07,825 --> 02:26:09,452
It was our director's idea,

3406
02:26:09,894 --> 02:26:12,192
and he felt that
that little play between us

3407
02:26:12,430 --> 02:26:14,193
built up the suspense,
and I think it did.

3408
02:26:14,432 --> 02:26:15,899
Later on when I saw the film,

3409
02:26:16,134 --> 02:26:28,478
I thought it added
quite a bit to it.

3410
02:26:28,913 --> 02:26:30,938
You know,
he wasn't brilliant and cunning,

3411
02:26:31,182 --> 02:26:32,774
but he was smart,
or he figured some things out,

3412
02:26:33,017 --> 02:26:35,485
you know, in an animal plus way.

3413
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:38,252
I never thought of her
as being a heroine

3414
02:26:38,489 --> 02:26:41,219
until, you know,
you actually watch the movie

3415
02:26:41,459 --> 02:26:47,830
and you go,
"Wow! She's kicking some ass."

3416
02:26:48,065 --> 02:26:50,465
But how are we going
to get him in the end?.

3417
02:26:50,902 --> 02:26:52,199
Are we going to use
silver bullets?.

3418
02:26:52,436 --> 02:26:53,403
Are we going to use garlic?.

3419
02:26:53,838 --> 02:26:55,169
Are we going to use a stake?.

3420
02:26:55,406 --> 02:26:56,395
Are we going to use any of
the typical clichÈ ways

3421
02:26:56,841 --> 02:26:58,468
to kill a bad man?. No!

3422
02:26:58,910 --> 02:27:02,402
We're going to use intelligence
to outsmart him.

3423
02:27:02,847 --> 02:27:03,438
And of course, of course,
there's an obvious relationship

3424
02:27:03,881 --> 02:27:06,042
between Tommy and Jason

3425
02:27:06,284 --> 02:27:08,445
when Tommy takes on the persona
and impersonates him

3426
02:27:08,886 --> 02:27:14,153
as a weapon to undo him.

3427
02:27:14,392 --> 02:27:16,417
Jason!

3428
02:27:16,861 --> 02:27:18,158
I remember when I first
heard this I went,

3429
02:27:18,396 --> 02:27:20,023
"Really?. They're going to
make me look like Jason?.

3430
02:27:20,264 --> 02:27:21,356
How's that going to work??"'

3431
02:27:21,599 --> 02:27:26,195
The choice was made to not
go the truthful, honest,

3432
02:27:26,437 --> 02:27:28,268
you know, dedicated actor way
and actually go for it

3433
02:27:28,506 --> 02:27:29,939
and shave my head.

3434
02:27:30,174 --> 02:27:31,801
Instead we were going to use
Tom Savini's

3435
02:27:32,043 --> 02:27:33,567
great, illustrious
makeup effects once again

3436
02:27:34,011 --> 02:27:37,003
and put a bald cap on.

3437
02:27:37,248 --> 02:27:38,977
We talked about so many ways
to kill Jason.

3438
02:27:39,217 --> 02:27:41,208
There were so many
death proposals.

3439
02:27:41,452 --> 02:27:42,942
They came from everywhere.

3440
02:27:43,187 --> 02:27:45,178
Of course, the producers would
dream them up every night,

3441
02:27:45,423 --> 02:27:49,291
but mostly Tom would come up
with really cool ways to do it.

3442
02:27:49,527 --> 02:27:51,085
And we described this
elaborate thing with Tommy,

3443
02:27:51,329 --> 02:27:54,162
the effects kid,
was also an amateur inventor,

3444
02:27:54,398 --> 02:27:56,832
and he's taken a microwave oven
apart, you know,

3445
02:27:57,068 --> 02:27:58,057
and put a reflector behind it
with a variat

3446
02:27:58,302 --> 02:27:59,269
that goes from 1 to 1 0.

3447
02:27:59,503 --> 02:28:01,334
On 1 he melts a toy soldier.

3448
02:28:01,572 --> 02:28:03,164
We thought, why don't, you know,

3449
02:28:03,407 --> 02:28:06,240
at the end he jams this thing
into Jason's head,

3450
02:28:06,477 --> 02:28:06,875
turns it up to 1 0,
cooks his head from within,

3451
02:28:07,111 --> 02:28:08,908
and his head explodes.

3452
02:28:09,146 --> 02:28:10,875
And the producers took it
very seriously for a while.

3453
02:28:11,115 --> 02:28:12,173
And there were others,
there were other things,

3454
02:28:12,416 --> 02:28:16,113
but they were generally
clever things

3455
02:28:16,354 --> 02:28:18,948
that special effects guys
can sort of laugh about

3456
02:28:19,190 --> 02:28:21,181
and high-five each other for,
you know, in the lab.

3457
02:28:21,425 --> 02:28:23,484
But in the end,

3458
02:28:23,928 --> 02:28:26,260
give the audience a distance
from what really was happening.

3459
02:28:26,497 --> 02:28:28,522
I remember thinking, "Okay,
I've really got to show

3460
02:28:28,966 --> 02:28:30,558
how mean I can be,
how tough I can be.

3461
02:28:31,002 --> 02:28:32,196
You know,
that I'm this little kid,

3462
02:28:32,436 --> 02:28:33,334
but I can kill this guy.

3463
02:28:33,571 --> 02:28:35,163
I can do this.

3464
02:28:35,406 --> 02:28:37,465
Jason is about using
a very simple weapon

3465
02:28:37,909 --> 02:28:40,139
to do awful things,

3466
02:28:40,378 --> 02:28:41,936
and it would be sort of nice

3467
02:28:42,179 --> 02:28:43,578
if we just use
a very simple weapon

3468
02:28:44,015 --> 02:28:45,243
to do an awful thing to him.

3469
02:28:45,483 --> 02:28:47,974
A change was suggested to us

3470
02:28:48,219 --> 02:28:52,451
that Jason's head be lopped off
top down,

3471
02:28:52,690 --> 02:28:54,248
not across the neck.

3472
02:28:54,492 --> 02:28:56,016
In other words, cut open
from the top to the chin

3473
02:28:56,260 --> 02:28:58,922
Iike an artichoke.

3474
02:28:59,163 --> 02:29:00,221
And they suggested
we didn't do that.

3475
02:29:00,464 --> 02:29:02,557
And we thought, hmm.

3476
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,365
I think there's going
to be a sequel here.'

3477
02:29:04,602 --> 02:29:06,934
You maybe were expecting
something quick.

3478
02:29:07,171 --> 02:29:08,263
Tommy hits him in the head
with a blade and, you know,

3479
02:29:08,506 --> 02:29:10,030
the end. No.
He slides down the blade.

3480
02:29:10,274 --> 02:29:12,538
I came into the set
with 1 01 fever that day.

3481
02:29:12,977 --> 02:29:14,467
I was very sick.

3482
02:29:14,712 --> 02:29:15,474
And it's the middle
of the night,

3483
02:29:15,713 --> 02:29:17,578
and you're already sick,

3484
02:29:18,015 --> 02:29:19,983
and now you're sitting there
using all of your energy

3485
02:29:20,217 --> 02:29:22,344
to kill this giant man.

3486
02:29:22,586 --> 02:29:24,520
And the fact that I was sick,

3487
02:29:24,956 --> 02:29:26,184
and the fact that I was
so under the weather,

3488
02:29:26,424 --> 02:29:29,416
and I was like really fighting
just to be there at that moment,

3489
02:29:29,660 --> 02:29:30,957
I think comes across
in the look in my eyes.

3490
02:29:31,195 --> 02:29:35,188
Tommy!

3491
02:29:35,433 --> 02:29:38,231
Die!

3492
02:29:38,469 --> 02:29:40,198
Because you can see
the desperation in my eyes

3493
02:29:40,438 --> 02:29:41,632
as I'm trying to take him down.

3494
02:29:42,073 --> 02:29:43,973
What happened with "Friday 4"

3495
02:29:44,208 --> 02:29:46,199
is that the Motion Picture
Association of America

3496
02:29:46,444 --> 02:29:47,468
was really on us.

3497
02:29:47,712 --> 02:29:49,942
And it was kind of a game

3498
02:29:50,181 --> 02:29:52,149
where you would trim them down a
little bit,

3499
02:29:52,383 --> 02:29:55,181
send it back,
trim them down a little bit,

3500
02:29:55,419 --> 02:29:57,717
and they would wear you down,
and you would wear them down.

3501
02:29:58,155 --> 02:30:00,419
We would keep trading off frames
of everybody else's kill scenes

3502
02:30:00,658 --> 02:30:02,455
so we could protect
as much of Jason.

3503
02:30:02,693 --> 02:30:05,127
The kills are all there
but they were very fast.

3504
02:30:05,363 --> 02:30:07,297
But when Jason finally got it,
you dwelled on it.

3505
02:30:07,531 --> 02:30:10,364
It made Jason's death
more powerful.

3506
02:30:10,601 --> 02:30:17,439
This is the one
you've been screaming for.

3507
02:30:17,675 --> 02:30:19,302
'Friday the 1 3th
The Final Chapter"

3508
02:30:19,543 --> 02:30:22,376
debuted on April 1 3, 1 984.

3509
02:30:22,613 --> 02:30:25,013
Although it still didn't
win over any critics,

3510
02:30:25,249 --> 02:30:28,741
the film went on to gross
an impressive $32.9 million.

3511
02:30:29,186 --> 02:30:30,744
As far as the filmmakers
were concerned,

3512
02:30:31,188 --> 02:30:33,179
they had done their job.

3513
02:30:33,424 --> 02:30:34,652
Jason had left the screen
on a high note

3514
02:30:35,092 --> 02:30:36,753
and was gone for good.

3515
02:30:37,194 --> 02:30:40,425
Or was he?.

3516
02:30:40,664 --> 02:30:43,189
It really was this kind of
renegade little group

3517
02:30:43,434 --> 02:30:47,131
that was involved
in major motion pictures,

3518
02:30:47,371 --> 02:30:51,535
that, you know,
would knock off big movies.

3519
02:30:51,776 --> 02:30:53,767
Clint Eastwood would do 7,
and we'd do 9.

3520
02:30:54,211 --> 02:30:56,008
I mean, it would be like you
know the people at Warner Bros.

3521
02:30:56,247 --> 02:30:57,441
were cursing us up and down.

3522
02:30:57,681 --> 02:30:58,340
It's like, you know,
those bastards

3523
02:30:58,582 --> 02:31:00,174
with the million dollar movie
beat us!

3524
02:31:00,418 --> 02:31:01,350
I remember
in the New York Times,

3525
02:31:01,585 --> 02:31:03,348
I think it was Janet Maslin

3526
02:31:03,587 --> 02:31:07,455
wrote like an angry review
about the film.

3527
02:31:07,691 --> 02:31:09,318
At least from
this critic's point of view

3528
02:31:09,560 --> 02:31:11,790
it was actually
kind of disturbing

3529
02:31:12,229 --> 02:31:14,663
to see people
that you actually did create

3530
02:31:15,099 --> 02:31:16,361
some kind of relationship with,

3531
02:31:16,600 --> 02:31:19,091
you know meet their demise
in the horrible ways

3532
02:31:19,336 --> 02:31:20,701
that we all did.

3533
02:31:21,138 --> 02:31:22,662
We had fun reading the reviews.

3534
02:31:23,107 --> 02:31:24,074
We know what they're going
to be like

3535
02:31:24,308 --> 02:31:25,798
and especially if someone gets,
you know,

3536
02:31:26,243 --> 02:31:27,801
particularly bitchy and clever.
It's great.

3537
02:31:28,245 --> 02:31:30,145
I mean,
in a way it's sort of like

3538
02:31:30,381 --> 02:31:32,508
the 'Friday the 1 3th"
movie itself.

3539
02:31:32,750 --> 02:31:33,182
If they're clever in the way
they're trying to kill you,

3540
02:31:33,417 --> 02:31:35,783
you cheer.

3541
02:31:36,220 --> 02:31:37,619
At the time I was not
really overly proud

3542
02:31:37,855 --> 02:31:39,482
of making the film.

3543
02:31:39,723 --> 02:31:42,191
You know, I was offered
the 5th one and 6th one.

3544
02:31:42,426 --> 02:31:43,757
I could have done either one
of them, and I turned them down.

3545
02:31:44,195 --> 02:31:46,425
I'm sorry now that I did
turn them down.

3546
02:31:46,664 --> 02:31:49,394
We all just wanted to make it
as good as we could make it.

3547
02:31:49,633 --> 02:31:51,828
We didn't want it to be
campy and stupid.

3548
02:31:52,269 --> 02:31:55,636
As much as we could make it
real and scary

3549
02:31:55,873 --> 02:31:57,841
and that we would be feeling
the real feelings.

3550
02:31:58,275 --> 02:32:00,743
Everybody had the same goals.

3551
02:32:01,178 --> 02:32:03,373
We were already at that time
talking about ways

3552
02:32:03,614 --> 02:32:05,343
to further the franchise,
elongate the franchise,

3553
02:32:05,583 --> 02:32:07,414
bring my character back.

3554
02:32:07,651 --> 02:32:09,380
And when we did the end scene
in the hospital,

3555
02:32:09,620 --> 02:32:13,716
to Joe and l, that was the nod,

3556
02:32:14,158 --> 02:32:16,285
that was the way to kind of
set up the next film.

3557
02:32:16,527 --> 02:32:18,825
But I thought what a big win
this would be,

3558
02:32:19,263 --> 02:32:21,527
you know, as a new director,

3559
02:32:21,765 --> 02:32:24,131
if I could make this thing live

3560
02:32:24,368 --> 02:32:26,097
and become something that fans
can appreciate again,

3561
02:32:26,337 --> 02:32:28,305
and the studio was surprised,

3562
02:32:28,539 --> 02:32:31,269
and they go ahead
and take it out and make more.

3563
02:32:31,509 --> 02:32:34,603
What we decided to do was make
a statement about horror.

3564
02:32:34,845 --> 02:32:36,608
That horror is contagious.

3565
02:32:36,847 --> 02:32:40,442
The horror that Jason dispenses
has been passed on to Tommy.

3566
02:32:40,684 --> 02:32:42,709
And maybe I was the next Jason.

3567
02:32:43,154 --> 02:32:45,816
Maybe it was The Final Chapter
of this Jason,

3568
02:32:46,257 --> 02:32:47,747
but maybe "Part 5"
was going to be

3569
02:32:48,192 --> 02:32:50,353
Tommy comes to fruition,

3570
02:32:50,594 --> 02:32:53,119
Tommy comes into his own
as the next great serial killer.

3571
02:32:53,364 --> 02:32:55,730
And that was really the set-up

3572
02:32:56,167 --> 02:32:58,260
for where the franchise
was intended to go.

3573
02:32:58,502 --> 02:33:00,493
If somebody had pressed me
at that time

3574
02:33:00,738 --> 02:33:02,467
and said how about
six more movies,

3575
02:33:02,706 --> 02:33:05,140
it would have been not the
running Tommy Jarvis character,

3576
02:33:05,376 --> 02:33:07,207
but this contagion of horror

3577
02:33:07,444 --> 02:33:09,173
going from one person
to the next.

3578
02:33:09,413 --> 02:33:11,506
And the look of Tommy
in the end was, you know,

3579
02:33:11,749 --> 02:33:14,309
it wasn't an accident.

3580
02:33:14,552 --> 02:33:20,691
I mean, that was something
that was hoping to give birth

3581
02:33:20,691 --> 02:33:30,931
I mean, that was something
that was hoping to give birth

3582
02:33:31,368 --> 02:33:33,529
Few modern horror franchises

3583
02:33:33,771 --> 02:33:37,332
can commit cinematic suicide
and return to tell the tale.

3584
02:33:37,575 --> 02:33:40,373
But the prospect of wringing
a few more dollars

3585
02:33:40,611 --> 02:33:42,340
from one of their
least expensive

3586
02:33:42,580 --> 02:33:44,377
and most profitable franchises

3587
02:33:44,615 --> 02:33:46,583
was hard for Paramount
to ignore.

3588
02:33:46,817 --> 02:33:48,250
What else can you do with it?.

3589
02:33:48,485 --> 02:33:49,816
We've just killed Jason.

3590
02:33:50,254 --> 02:33:51,243
We've just said that
the series is ended.

3591
02:33:51,488 --> 02:33:52,477
You've gotta figure out
something to do.

3592
02:33:52,723 --> 02:33:55,283
So everybody
was trying to figure out

3593
02:33:55,526 --> 02:33:57,721
a way to break the
"you're making the same movie

3594
02:33:57,962 --> 02:33:59,623
over and over again."

3595
02:33:59,863 --> 02:34:02,354
The title of "New Beginning,"
I think came from Frank.

3596
02:34:02,600 --> 02:34:05,398
I think it was how
he was reaching around

3597
02:34:05,636 --> 02:34:06,796
for a way
to let the audience know

3598
02:34:07,238 --> 02:34:10,366
that we were promising them
something new

3599
02:34:10,608 --> 02:34:12,576
after having told them
that it was done.

3600
02:34:12,810 --> 02:34:15,472
I had been an assistant editor
for many years,

3601
02:34:15,713 --> 02:34:19,205
mostly for Michael Kahn who's
Steven Spielberg's editor,

3602
02:34:19,450 --> 02:34:21,782
and I was an assistant editor on
"Raiders of the Lost Ark,"

3603
02:34:22,019 --> 02:34:23,577
"lndiana Jones
and the Temple of Doom,"

3604
02:34:23,821 --> 02:34:26,289
the "Star Wars."

3605
02:34:26,523 --> 02:34:28,252
And Michael said to Frank,
'You should hire Bruce.

3606
02:34:28,492 --> 02:34:29,982
I can vouch for him,

3607
02:34:30,427 --> 02:34:32,292
and if he doesn't do a job
that you like,

3608
02:34:32,529 --> 02:34:33,393
I'll come in, and I'll cut
the film for free.'

3609
02:34:33,631 --> 02:34:35,656
After "Part 4,"
I felt like, okay,

3610
02:34:35,899 --> 02:34:37,924
I need to take a step back,

3611
02:34:38,369 --> 02:34:41,964
and I need to find people
to just sort of have their,

3612
02:34:42,406 --> 02:34:44,966
you know, imprint
go on these films.

3613
02:34:45,409 --> 02:34:45,966
I'll make sure
they come in on budget,

3614
02:34:46,410 --> 02:34:47,809
and I'll make sure
we get people

3615
02:34:48,045 --> 02:34:49,774
that are placed
in the right positions

3616
02:34:50,014 --> 02:34:52,346
so that they're not
going to get screwed with.

3617
02:34:52,583 --> 02:34:54,881
But, you know, that creatively
this is really going to be

3618
02:34:55,319 --> 02:34:55,876
sort of
other people's stuff now.

3619
02:34:56,320 --> 02:34:58,754
With Frank Mancuso, Jr.

3620
02:34:58,989 --> 02:35:02,584
now taking on a more ceremonial
role as an executive producer,

3621
02:35:02,826 --> 02:35:05,294
the job of finding a director
for "Friday the 1 3th Part 5"

3622
02:35:05,529 --> 02:35:07,258
once again fell
to the uncredited

3623
02:35:07,498 --> 02:35:09,762
yet always omnipresent
Phil Scuderi.

3624
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,662
This time, he chose a director

3625
02:35:12,903 --> 02:35:16,930
from the world of
exploitation cinema and porn.

3626
02:35:17,374 --> 02:35:19,035
These guys from Boston

3627
02:35:19,476 --> 02:35:22,604
also did
"Last House on the Left."

3628
02:35:22,846 --> 02:35:25,041
So before the film was finished,

3629
02:35:25,482 --> 02:35:29,418
they were going to Cannes
to sell

3630
02:35:29,653 --> 02:35:30,517
"The Last House
on the Left, Part 2."

3631
02:35:30,754 --> 02:35:33,416
And they offered me
to write it and direct it.

3632
02:35:33,657 --> 02:35:35,818
And I said, Sure.

3633
02:35:36,060 --> 02:35:38,426
Then it turns out that they
didn't have their full ownership

3634
02:35:38,662 --> 02:35:40,596
of the rights.

3635
02:35:40,831 --> 02:35:42,958
Phil Scuderi, he somehow
knew Danny Steinmann.

3636
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:45,061
And thought
that he would be a good choice

3637
02:35:45,502 --> 02:35:45,968
to direct the film.

3638
02:35:46,403 --> 02:35:49,031
And so, again,

3639
02:35:49,473 --> 02:35:51,338
I wasn't going to be in
a situation where I'm saying,

3640
02:35:51,575 --> 02:35:55,511
"I'm not going to drive the bus,
I'm going to take a step back"

3641
02:35:55,746 --> 02:35:56,940
and then say, "Oh, no,
you can't use this guy,

3642
02:35:57,381 --> 02:35:57,608
and you can't do this,
and you can't do that.

3643
02:35:57,848 --> 02:35:58,815
I wanted to say, "Ok."

3644
02:35:59,049 --> 02:36:00,482
And I knew nothing about

3645
02:36:00,718 --> 02:36:07,556
his past filmmaking experiences
at all.

3646
02:36:07,791 --> 02:36:10,351
He arrived pumped
and full of energy

3647
02:36:10,594 --> 02:36:12,824
and ready to do another draft
of the script,

3648
02:36:13,063 --> 02:36:15,861
which was what everybody
had agreed needed to be done.

3649
02:36:16,100 --> 02:36:17,067
As far as the script
was concerned,

3650
02:36:17,501 --> 02:36:19,628
after they discounted the fact

3651
02:36:19,870 --> 02:36:22,031
that Jason is going to be alive
and kicking,

3652
02:36:22,473 --> 02:36:26,842
they thought that using Tommy
as a new Jason

3653
02:36:27,077 --> 02:36:31,013
would be an interesting
and fun thing to do.

3654
02:36:31,448 --> 02:36:32,745
Did Tommy do this?.
Did he not?.

3655
02:36:32,983 --> 02:36:35,713
Was Tommy crazy?.

3656
02:36:35,953 --> 02:36:38,922
These things were running
through the script.

3657
02:36:39,156 --> 02:36:42,421
Unfortunately, Spielberg
fucked up all our plans

3658
02:36:42,659 --> 02:36:45,890
because he decided he
wanted me in a couple films.

3659
02:36:46,130 --> 02:36:49,497
I was forced,
quite begrudgingly,

3660
02:36:49,733 --> 02:36:51,792
to participate in a little film
called "Goonies"

3661
02:36:52,035 --> 02:36:55,061
and not participate,
as I would have liked,

3662
02:36:55,506 --> 02:36:57,997
in the full version
of "Friday the 1 3th Part 5."

3663
02:36:58,442 --> 02:37:00,603
So instead,
a compromise was reached.

3664
02:37:00,844 --> 02:37:03,005
I would come do a cameo

3665
02:37:03,447 --> 02:37:06,746
to help buy myself
out of the pre-made story

3666
02:37:06,984 --> 02:37:08,144
that we had all come up with
years before.

3667
02:37:08,585 --> 02:37:12,646
To schedule
to get him back was insane.

3668
02:37:12,890 --> 02:37:15,654
He was busier than anybody
I'd ever met in my life.

3669
02:37:15,893 --> 02:37:17,622
So what we did,
we went over to his house,

3670
02:37:17,861 --> 02:37:21,092
and in his backyard
we put up bushes,

3671
02:37:21,532 --> 02:37:23,124
had the rain machine,

3672
02:37:23,567 --> 02:37:26,035
and did it all like in like
an hour and a half, two hours,

3673
02:37:26,470 --> 02:37:29,405
and got him done that way.

3674
02:37:29,640 --> 02:37:31,130
And we used then
a very small woman

3675
02:37:31,575 --> 02:37:33,668
to walk through the woods.

3676
02:37:33,911 --> 02:37:37,074
And I thought it was really
actually brilliantly executed.

3677
02:37:37,514 --> 02:37:40,642
In casting Tommy, uh...

3678
02:37:40,884 --> 02:37:42,749
I wanted someone who was tall,
of course,

3679
02:37:42,986 --> 02:37:44,476
had some weight on him,

3680
02:37:44,721 --> 02:37:47,019
and was good physically.

3681
02:37:47,458 --> 02:37:49,153
When I came in for the audition
I again, I resolved

3682
02:37:49,593 --> 02:37:50,457
I'm not going to talk
to anybody,

3683
02:37:50,694 --> 02:37:51,126
I'm not going to look them
in the eye,

3684
02:37:51,562 --> 02:37:52,893
I'll answer yes or no questions.

3685
02:37:53,130 --> 02:37:54,961
And then when Danny
called me in,

3686
02:37:55,199 --> 02:37:57,565
I just sat down
and looked and stared,

3687
02:37:57,801 --> 02:37:58,631
and I started sweating.
And it was great.

3688
02:37:58,869 --> 02:38:01,667
And he got it.

3689
02:38:01,905 --> 02:38:04,965
So it emboldened me to really
become the character.

3690
02:38:05,209 --> 02:38:07,769
After being released
from a mental asylum,

3691
02:38:08,011 --> 02:38:10,104
Tommy Jarvis is sent to live
in a halfway house

3692
02:38:10,547 --> 02:38:13,209
populated by a group
of at-risk teens.

3693
02:38:13,650 --> 02:38:16,210
Taking a cue from the plot
of the original film,

3694
02:38:16,653 --> 02:38:18,883
the producers decided
that the identity of the killer

3695
02:38:19,122 --> 02:38:21,750
would not be revealed
until the final act.

3696
02:38:21,992 --> 02:38:26,122
"Friday the 1 3th Part 5
would be a whodunit.

3697
02:38:26,563 --> 02:38:30,727
In a sense the whole picture
becomes one giant red herring

3698
02:38:30,968 --> 02:38:34,495
because we're going to
pull the plug on it

3699
02:38:34,738 --> 02:38:36,467
right at the very end
of the film.

3700
02:38:36,707 --> 02:38:38,470
The guys who started the series

3701
02:38:38,709 --> 02:38:41,610
ultimately signed off on that
idea, you know.

3702
02:38:41,845 --> 02:38:42,971
I mean, that was--
that came out of Boston

3703
02:38:43,213 --> 02:38:45,511
and that was okay,
and everybody wanted

3704
02:38:45,749 --> 02:38:48,240
to sort of take this road and
maybe thought it may be cool.

3705
02:38:48,685 --> 02:38:52,553
In 5, I actually played
the imposter of Jason.

3706
02:38:52,789 --> 02:38:55,519
Dick Warlock, who is known
for Michael Myers,

3707
02:38:55,759 --> 02:38:56,817
he was the stunt coordinator.

3708
02:38:57,060 --> 02:38:59,620
Part of that job
was to bring in some guys

3709
02:38:59,863 --> 02:39:00,761
that could play Jason.

3710
02:39:00,998 --> 02:39:03,262
So I brought in three guys

3711
02:39:03,700 --> 02:39:04,132
and when I brought them in,
I knew who I wanted.

3712
02:39:04,568 --> 02:39:06,160
I wanted Tom Morgan.

3713
02:39:06,603 --> 02:39:09,071
This guy's an exceptional
stunt guy.

3714
02:39:09,306 --> 02:39:12,275
He's agile and, you know,
and that's why I wanted him.

3715
02:39:12,709 --> 02:39:13,676
I knew that if Jason had to do
anything at all

3716
02:39:13,911 --> 02:39:15,902
that Tom could carry it off.

3717
02:39:16,146 --> 02:39:19,013
My idea was that I was going
to play the character

3718
02:39:19,249 --> 02:39:21,012
as Jason.

3719
02:39:21,251 --> 02:39:23,048
That's what they wanted.

3720
02:39:23,287 --> 02:39:25,187
And at the end they'd sort out
what the answer was.

3721
02:39:25,622 --> 02:39:28,614
And I did have a couple moments

3722
02:39:28,859 --> 02:39:32,693
where I did play the apparition
of Jason himself.

3723
02:39:32,930 --> 02:39:35,660
In the film, it was obvious
they had to distinguish

3724
02:39:35,899 --> 02:39:38,197
in some way so they used the
blue for the marks on the mask

3725
02:39:38,635 --> 02:39:40,762
for the imposter Jason,

3726
02:39:41,004 --> 02:39:43,063
where when I did
the actual Jason,

3727
02:39:43,307 --> 02:39:46,936
I was wearing the real mask
with the red marks on it.

3728
02:39:47,177 --> 02:39:51,045
There's a shot where the camera
is looking out at Jason

3729
02:39:51,281 --> 02:39:52,748
right as he steps out
from behind a tree.

3730
02:39:52,983 --> 02:39:54,780
I was just standing still.

3731
02:39:55,018 --> 02:39:57,748
I had nothing to do
but to look up at the window.

3732
02:39:57,988 --> 02:40:00,616
I'm in the window upstairs.

3733
02:40:00,857 --> 02:40:02,017
And he was trying
to make me laugh

3734
02:40:02,259 --> 02:40:04,659
standing there in the mask.

3735
02:40:04,895 --> 02:40:06,886
I turned around
and mooned him,

3736
02:40:07,130 --> 02:40:09,325
and he's laughing
underneath the mask

3737
02:40:09,766 --> 02:40:15,671
trying to not do this, you know.

3738
02:40:15,906 --> 02:40:17,339
And I'll never forget
the day we shot that scene

3739
02:40:17,774 --> 02:40:19,571
where I look up
and in the mirror,

3740
02:40:19,810 --> 02:40:21,004
there's a guy with a machete
and a mask on,

3741
02:40:21,244 --> 02:40:22,108
and I look again, and he's gone.

3742
02:40:22,346 --> 02:40:25,179
And is he real?. Is he there?.

3743
02:40:25,616 --> 02:40:27,607
Is he monster or victim?.
Well, he's a little bit of both.

3744
02:40:27,851 --> 02:40:30,251
And I find that when I look
at the man in the mirror

3745
02:40:30,687 --> 02:40:32,018
that there's a monster there
and there's a victim

3746
02:40:32,255 --> 02:40:33,085
depending on which day it is.

3747
02:40:33,323 --> 02:40:35,587
Call me Reggie the Reckless.

3748
02:40:35,826 --> 02:40:38,021
Shavar Ross was--
he was adorable.

3749
02:40:38,261 --> 02:40:41,162
Again, you know,
a little, young talent.

3750
02:40:41,398 --> 02:40:43,992
Yes, Miss Osbourne.

3751
02:40:44,234 --> 02:40:46,702
There was many times on the set
during "Friday the 1 3th Part 5"

3752
02:40:46,937 --> 02:40:48,928
where a lot of screaming,

3753
02:40:49,172 --> 02:40:51,003
and, "Hey, he's got
to get off the set.

3754
02:40:51,241 --> 02:40:52,105
We ain't got too much time.
He's got to go to school."

3755
02:40:52,342 --> 02:40:54,333
Solid.

3756
02:40:54,778 --> 02:40:57,178
In keeping with
"Friday the 1 3th" tradition,

3757
02:40:57,414 --> 02:40:59,644
the services of a smart
and resourceful leading lady

3758
02:40:59,883 --> 02:41:00,872
were required.

3759
02:41:01,118 --> 02:41:03,245
This time, however,

3760
02:41:03,687 --> 02:41:06,656
the film's final girl
was anything but a happy camper.

3761
02:41:06,890 --> 02:41:08,915
John had a very heavy character

3762
02:41:09,159 --> 02:41:11,354
and mine was just dealing

3763
02:41:11,795 --> 02:41:12,887
with trying to do the best
I could

3764
02:41:13,130 --> 02:41:14,927
under bad conditions
because the conditions were bad.

3765
02:41:15,165 --> 02:41:16,860
Low-budget movie making
is tough,

3766
02:41:17,100 --> 02:41:20,399
and it's tough
on kind of everybody.

3767
02:41:20,837 --> 02:41:23,965
She was expecting
to be picked up every day

3768
02:41:24,207 --> 02:41:26,334
and brought to the set

3769
02:41:26,777 --> 02:41:27,300
and, I think, in a limo
or something to that effect,

3770
02:41:27,744 --> 02:41:28,836
and that's another world.

3771
02:41:29,079 --> 02:41:31,013
I don't think
anybody gets above,

3772
02:41:31,248 --> 02:41:32,112
no matter where you are
in the food chain,

3773
02:41:32,349 --> 02:41:36,285
nobody gets above the desire
to do something good,

3774
02:41:36,720 --> 02:41:37,812
but the limitations
of what you're dealing with.

3775
02:41:38,055 --> 02:41:40,023
Danny, you couldn't go to him.

3776
02:41:40,257 --> 02:41:43,693
And actors, especially when
you're young and starting out,

3777
02:41:43,927 --> 02:41:45,895
you kind of look to
the director as a father figure.

3778
02:41:46,129 --> 02:41:48,654
And I had a question, and he'd
just say, "Just do it."

3779
02:41:48,899 --> 02:41:50,332
So from that moment on,

3780
02:41:50,767 --> 02:41:51,859
and that was about, I think,

3781
02:41:52,102 --> 02:41:52,932
the second or third day
of filming.

3782
02:41:53,170 --> 02:41:55,138
So at that moment I said,

3783
02:41:55,372 --> 02:41:56,703
"Okay, you're really
on your own here."

3784
02:41:56,940 --> 02:41:57,872
I'm sure that's
an uncomfortable part to play,

3785
02:41:58,108 --> 02:42:02,135
you know,
when you have a director

3786
02:42:02,379 --> 02:42:06,679
that isn't exactly gracious
but you've got a role to play.

3787
02:42:06,917 --> 02:42:11,320
So I decided to just do
what I set out to do,

3788
02:42:11,755 --> 02:42:13,882
to do the best job I could.

3789
02:42:14,124 --> 02:42:15,250
I understand to some people
that Daniel was kind of coarse.

3790
02:42:15,492 --> 02:42:17,119
And kind of rough.

3791
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:21,763
I can only say...

3792
02:42:21,998 --> 02:42:23,693
it wasn't that way
when I was around,

3793
02:42:23,934 --> 02:42:25,925
but I wasn't really around
that much.

3794
02:42:26,169 --> 02:42:29,195
In order to maintain the secrecy
of the film's storyline,

3795
02:42:29,439 --> 02:42:31,964
the movie went into production
with a befitting code title:

3796
02:42:32,209 --> 02:42:35,144
"Repetition."

3797
02:42:35,378 --> 02:42:38,905
No way did I know that this was
a "Friday the 1 3th" movie.

3798
02:42:39,149 --> 02:42:41,379
So the first day
we're sitting on the set.

3799
02:42:41,818 --> 02:42:44,844
There's this guy with
a hockey mask and the blade.

3800
02:42:45,088 --> 02:42:48,057
He walks past us, stops
and stares right at us.

3801
02:42:48,291 --> 02:42:50,725
We looked at each other,

3802
02:42:50,961 --> 02:42:53,953
and the whole energy
just turned into excitement.

3803
02:42:54,197 --> 02:42:55,960
We're in "Friday the 1 3th!"
We're in "Friday the 1 3th!"

3804
02:42:56,199 --> 02:42:57,826
I want this looney bin
closed down.

3805
02:42:58,068 --> 02:42:59,968
You tell 'em, Ma!

3806
02:43:00,203 --> 02:43:05,470
I did a fair amount
of ad-libbing as Ethel.

3807
02:43:05,909 --> 02:43:06,375
Horse shit.

3808
02:43:06,810 --> 02:43:07,936
Shut the fuck up.

3809
02:43:08,178 --> 02:43:10,009
You big dildo.

3810
02:43:10,247 --> 02:43:12,511
Lots of swear words came out.

3811
02:43:12,949 --> 02:43:15,110
Who the fuck are you?.
What the fuck do you want?.

3812
02:43:15,352 --> 02:43:18,810
One of my favorite scenes

3813
02:43:19,055 --> 02:43:20,784
is in the kitchen
with a chicken.

3814
02:43:21,024 --> 02:43:24,425
I'm gonna chop you

3815
02:43:24,861 --> 02:43:27,853
into itty bitty little pieces,
my friend.

3816
02:43:28,098 --> 02:43:30,089
You know, the stew that Junior
had to eat in the show,

3817
02:43:30,333 --> 02:43:34,292
it was foul only because
it was cold Campbell's soup.

3818
02:43:34,538 --> 02:43:36,904
Best goddamn stew in the whole
wide world, Momma.

3819
02:43:37,140 --> 02:43:38,869
I thought, you know, we're going
to eat this for lunch.

3820
02:43:39,109 --> 02:43:40,770
Hey, Junior would eat anything!

3821
02:43:41,011 --> 02:43:43,411
[Stupid laughter]

3822
02:43:43,847 --> 02:43:46,407
I have a wig from a movie that
I'd done with Burt Reynolds

3823
02:43:46,850 --> 02:43:49,375
called "Sharky's Machine"
where I played a hooker.

3824
02:43:49,820 --> 02:43:51,412
You fuckin' low-life creep!

3825
02:43:51,855 --> 02:43:54,016
They loved it so much

3826
02:43:54,257 --> 02:43:55,019
that they wouldn't get me
another one.

3827
02:43:55,258 --> 02:43:56,885
I had to use mine.

3828
02:43:57,127 --> 02:43:59,152
Eeeeee-yahhh!

3829
02:43:59,396 --> 02:44:01,455
Eeeee-yah!

3830
02:44:01,898 --> 02:44:04,492
"Part 5's" first turning point
occurs when Joey,

3831
02:44:04,935 --> 02:44:06,903
a mentally-challenged
ward of the state,

3832
02:44:07,137 --> 02:44:10,072
incites the wrath of
the wood-chopping Vic Faden,

3833
02:44:10,307 --> 02:44:12,935
played by the late
Mark Venturini.

3834
02:44:13,176 --> 02:44:13,972
Hi, Vic.

3835
02:44:14,211 --> 02:44:15,508
Get lost!

3836
02:44:15,946 --> 02:44:18,506
And then, like that, he flips,

3837
02:44:18,949 --> 02:44:21,383
and the axe is going,
and there's blood flying.

3838
02:44:21,618 --> 02:44:24,451
The scene itself
was pretty grisly,

3839
02:44:24,888 --> 02:44:27,413
and they did a lot of takes
over and over and over.

3840
02:44:27,858 --> 02:44:29,587
Oh, god! [sobbing]

3841
02:44:30,026 --> 02:44:32,051
For the film's pivotal role

3842
02:44:32,295 --> 02:44:34,126
of soft-spoken ambulance driver
Roy Burns,

3843
02:44:34,364 --> 02:44:36,457
director Danny Steinmann
sought out an actor

3844
02:44:36,900 --> 02:44:38,424
who could project
an aura of menace

3845
02:44:38,869 --> 02:44:40,996
without tipping his hand.

3846
02:44:41,238 --> 02:44:42,466
Roy is called
an ambulance driver. He's not.

3847
02:44:42,906 --> 02:44:44,032
He's a paramedic.

3848
02:44:44,274 --> 02:44:46,242
He had seen
an awful lot of death

3849
02:44:46,476 --> 02:44:47,238
because this had been going
on for a little bit.

3850
02:44:47,477 --> 02:44:50,412
So when it ends up
being his son,

3851
02:44:50,647 --> 02:44:53,411
I think that's what
pushes him over.

3852
02:44:53,650 --> 02:44:56,585
My character was,
you know, a wise-ass.

3853
02:44:57,020 --> 02:44:58,453
My thing was I blew a bubble
and looked up at them and said

3854
02:44:58,889 --> 02:45:00,447
Bunch of pussies.

3855
02:45:00,891 --> 02:45:01,323
And then of course,
the moral of the character,

3856
02:45:01,558 --> 02:45:03,116
of my character,

3857
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:04,622
is be nice to your co-workers,

3858
02:45:05,061 --> 02:45:06,892
or you'll get your throat slit
from ear to ear.

3859
02:45:07,130 --> 02:45:09,121
With nearly two dozen
onscreen kills,

3860
02:45:09,366 --> 02:45:11,926
"Part 5" boasts one of
the highest body counts

3861
02:45:12,168 --> 02:45:13,965
in "Friday the 1 3th" history.

3862
02:45:14,204 --> 02:45:16,331
The producers
came up with the idea

3863
02:45:16,573 --> 02:45:21,476
that Tommy would be Jason
and then every 8, 9 minutes,

3864
02:45:21,912 --> 02:45:24,972
there should be a kill
or a jump, a big jump.

3865
02:45:25,215 --> 02:45:27,911
Come on, mother fucker,
fix the fuckin' car!

3866
02:45:28,151 --> 02:45:31,951
The death scenes
for Pete and Vinnie

3867
02:45:32,188 --> 02:45:34,588
were certainly gory.

3868
02:45:35,025 --> 02:45:42,056
I had the machete
across the throat, of course.

3869
02:45:42,299 --> 02:45:45,530
And they also
put most of their effort

3870
02:45:45,969 --> 02:45:49,029
into the gore
and into the kills.

3871
02:45:49,272 --> 02:45:56,474
And most of that footage
wound up on the floor.

3872
02:45:56,713 --> 02:45:59,273
I watched when they shot
Vinnie's death scene.

3873
02:45:59,516 --> 02:46:01,541
They had made a cast
of his face

3874
02:46:01,985 --> 02:46:05,477
and then made another face
of his out of latex,

3875
02:46:05,722 --> 02:46:07,952
and then they took
the road flare

3876
02:46:08,191 --> 02:46:09,590
and stuck it in his mouth.

3877
02:46:10,026 --> 02:46:12,051
You could see
everything glowing.

3878
02:46:12,295 --> 02:46:15,093
It was horrific but at
the same time, you know,

3879
02:46:15,332 --> 02:46:17,562
it was certainly an inventive
way to bring about his death.

3880
02:46:18,001 --> 02:46:19,059
Crap my ass!

3881
02:46:19,302 --> 02:46:20,667
Just do it, man!

3882
02:46:21,104 --> 02:46:26,098
Some people have supposed
that our characters

3883
02:46:26,343 --> 02:46:28,937
were the first gay characters

3884
02:46:29,179 --> 02:46:31,545
to be killed in
the "Friday the 1 3th" series,

3885
02:46:31,982 --> 02:46:33,244
and I think it's an open-ended
question.

3886
02:46:33,483 --> 02:46:36,145
I hadn't made that choice,

3887
02:46:36,386 --> 02:46:38,650
but who knows where it went
with Pete,

3888
02:46:39,089 --> 02:46:39,282
and where it would have gone,
you know,

3889
02:46:39,522 --> 02:46:40,352
if they could have lived
a little longer.

3890
02:46:40,590 --> 02:46:46,426
Lana! Hey, Lana!

3891
02:46:46,663 --> 02:46:48,563
Sorry, buster, we're closed.

3892
02:46:48,999 --> 02:46:52,526
The original scene
of Lana and Billy

3893
02:46:52,769 --> 02:46:55,294
were--I guess it was originally
written for "Part 4,"

3894
02:46:55,538 --> 02:46:57,233
but for whatever reason,
they didn't use it,

3895
02:46:57,474 --> 02:46:58,600
and they put it in "Part 5."

3896
02:46:59,042 --> 02:47:01,476
It just said,
"Billy calls for Lana.

3897
02:47:01,711 --> 02:47:06,614
He's waiting in the car,
and he starts doing cocaine."

3898
02:47:07,050 --> 02:47:09,712
(Coughing)

3899
02:47:10,153 --> 02:47:12,747
A couple weeks before that I had
seen the film "All That Jazz"

3900
02:47:13,189 --> 02:47:15,419
about Bob Fosse,

3901
02:47:15,658 --> 02:47:19,287
and he would throughout
the film say 'It's showtime.'

3902
02:47:19,529 --> 02:47:22,020
It's showtime, folks.

3903
02:47:22,265 --> 02:47:25,132
And so I came out of my trailer

3904
02:47:25,368 --> 02:47:26,733
and went up to Danny Steinmann,
the director,

3905
02:47:27,170 --> 02:47:28,330
and I said, "You know, Danny,"

3906
02:47:28,571 --> 02:47:29,595
I said, "I'm changing
in the dressing room,

3907
02:47:30,040 --> 02:47:31,564
getting ready for my boyfriend.

3908
02:47:31,808 --> 02:47:32,740
I said, What if I did
something really cute and sexy

3909
02:47:33,176 --> 02:47:36,668
Iike It'sshowtime!

3910
02:47:37,113 --> 02:47:39,479
He was like, "l love it!"

3911
02:47:39,716 --> 02:47:42,685
Using an axe on a guy's head

3912
02:47:43,119 --> 02:47:44,780
almost looks for real
when you're there

3913
02:47:45,221 --> 02:47:46,188
because you're looking
at the head,

3914
02:47:46,423 --> 02:47:47,321
which is just this guy's head.

3915
02:47:47,557 --> 02:47:48,581
It looks just like him.

3916
02:47:48,825 --> 02:47:50,725
The dummy had a full head
of hair,

3917
02:47:51,161 --> 02:47:53,356
and they were panic stricken
because I had a bald spot

3918
02:47:53,596 --> 02:47:55,393
and then Jason was going
to crash this axe

3919
02:47:55,632 --> 02:47:56,758
into a guy
with a full head of hair,

3920
02:47:57,200 --> 02:47:58,292
and they had
to take the dummy away,

3921
02:47:58,535 --> 02:48:00,730
get another head and, you know,

3922
02:48:01,171 --> 02:48:03,196
cut the hole but try
and make it look real.

3923
02:48:03,440 --> 02:48:05,601
So they got the bald spot
all set, made that up,

3924
02:48:05,842 --> 02:48:09,243
put the squibs under there
and then wham.

3925
02:48:09,479 --> 02:48:12,073
And that was his target,
the bald spot on my head.

3926
02:48:12,315 --> 02:48:14,306
Because I'm killed with an axe,

3927
02:48:14,551 --> 02:48:18,214
they built the cast with the axe
actually glued to it

3928
02:48:18,455 --> 02:48:20,047
and then they put my pink dress
over it,

3929
02:48:20,290 --> 02:48:21,154
and I'm covered with blood.

3930
02:48:21,391 --> 02:48:23,120
I kind of played along with it,

3931
02:48:23,359 --> 02:48:26,487
and I started walking through
the street going...

3932
02:48:26,729 --> 02:48:28,060
in front of the cars
and people were just like,

3933
02:48:28,298 --> 02:48:30,732
"Oh, my God."

3934
02:48:31,167 --> 02:48:32,429
Because they didn't know
a movie was being made up there.

3935
02:48:32,669 --> 02:48:34,296
So we had a lot of laughs
with that.

3936
02:48:34,537 --> 02:48:36,095
I played along with that.

3937
02:48:36,339 --> 02:48:37,806
These kids, people
were rooting for them to die.

3938
02:48:38,241 --> 02:48:40,209
Fuck you.

3939
02:48:40,443 --> 02:48:43,310
Exactly. Fuck me.

3940
02:48:43,546 --> 02:48:45,377
I don't know
if they were degenerates,

3941
02:48:45,615 --> 02:48:47,446
but they were definitely...

3942
02:48:47,684 --> 02:48:49,549
not wholesome.

3943
02:48:49,786 --> 02:48:51,413
In my mind the movie was more
like, you know, sort of

3944
02:48:51,654 --> 02:48:53,417
Fellini meets Hardcore.

3945
02:48:53,656 --> 02:48:55,783
I mean, it was just
sort of bizarre.

3946
02:48:56,226 --> 02:48:59,525
I was certainly surprised
by the sleazy quality

3947
02:48:59,762 --> 02:49:01,389
to the images.

3948
02:49:01,631 --> 02:49:03,258
Sleazy is a great word.

3949
02:49:03,500 --> 02:49:06,128
I mean, in terms of describing
"Part 5."

3950
02:49:06,369 --> 02:49:08,200
Everybody was cast because
of the size of their tits.

3951
02:49:08,438 --> 02:49:11,635
It was like a porn film
in a lot of ways.

3952
02:49:11,875 --> 02:49:15,242
I did my first nude scene
for Danny.

3953
02:49:15,478 --> 02:49:17,605
Sorry...(laughs) I didn't.

3954
02:49:17,847 --> 02:49:19,678
I just had to say that.

3955
02:49:19,916 --> 02:49:22,282
I think Danny Steinmann
was bringing to it

3956
02:49:22,519 --> 02:49:25,454
what he thought would make it
more urgent, you know.

3957
02:49:25,688 --> 02:49:28,122
More intense. Not as campy.

3958
02:49:28,358 --> 02:49:31,225
And some people
found that sleazy,

3959
02:49:31,461 --> 02:49:33,622
Some people found that
difficult to watch.

3960
02:49:33,863 --> 02:49:36,730
They obviously didn't appreciate
not having Jason around.

3961
02:49:37,167 --> 02:49:39,397
Although the part of
sex-starved Tina

3962
02:49:39,636 --> 02:49:42,730
was originally intended to be
played by actress Darcy DeMoss,

3963
02:49:43,173 --> 02:49:45,869
who would later appear
in "Friday the 1 3th Part 6,"

3964
02:49:46,309 --> 02:49:48,539
director Steinmann
ultimately gave the role

3965
02:49:48,778 --> 02:49:51,474
to a former Playboy bunny
with a familiar last name.

3966
02:49:51,714 --> 02:49:54,444
As soon as they saw
my last name, Voorhees,

3967
02:49:54,684 --> 02:49:57,847
they said we absolutely have to
interview this woman.

3968
02:49:58,288 --> 02:49:59,255
They told me I had the role
and then they told me

3969
02:49:59,489 --> 02:50:00,478
I had to go meet
with the producer

3970
02:50:00,723 --> 02:50:03,248
to audition three women.

3971
02:50:03,493 --> 02:50:05,620
Two of whom I remember,
one of them was Darcy DeMoss,

3972
02:50:05,862 --> 02:50:08,558
who ultimately played in role Vl

3973
02:50:08,798 --> 02:50:11,426
and was a long-time
girlfriend of mine after we met.

3974
02:50:11,668 --> 02:50:13,659
The other girl
was Gina Gershon,

3975
02:50:13,903 --> 02:50:15,564
you know,
"Faceoff,", "Showgirls."

3976
02:50:15,805 --> 02:50:17,170
She's been in a lot of stuff.

3977
02:50:17,407 --> 02:50:19,375
She went on to do very well.

3978
02:50:19,609 --> 02:50:23,409
I went in for my audition and
Danny Steinmann, the director,

3979
02:50:23,646 --> 02:50:25,170
asked me to lift my top up
and show my breasts.

3980
02:50:25,415 --> 02:50:27,508
I wasn't prepared for that
at all.

3981
02:50:27,750 --> 02:50:30,480
So I said "l have no problem
with nudity,

3982
02:50:30,720 --> 02:50:32,517
but you need to contact
my agent,

3983
02:50:32,755 --> 02:50:34,245
and have him okay it."

3984
02:50:34,490 --> 02:50:36,219
We made arrangements
to get together

3985
02:50:36,459 --> 02:50:38,188
because obviously we had
to shoot the woods scene,

3986
02:50:38,428 --> 02:50:41,192
the sex scene,
like the following Monday.

3987
02:50:41,431 --> 02:50:43,422
The next day,
I didn't have a part,

3988
02:50:43,666 --> 02:50:46,567
and the excuse was that I wasn't
well enough endowed.

3989
02:50:46,803 --> 02:50:48,668
It was one of those things
where the producer

3990
02:50:48,905 --> 02:50:52,705
had seen the one woman
and then the director saw me,

3991
02:50:52,942 --> 02:50:55,433
and he decided he wanted me.

3992
02:50:55,678 --> 02:50:56,975
And if you look at the girl,

3993
02:50:57,413 --> 02:50:58,505
her breasts
are absolutely enormous.

3994
02:50:58,748 --> 02:51:02,741
I did meet the guy, Eddie,

3995
02:51:02,986 --> 02:51:04,749
a couple days before
we actually, you know,

3996
02:51:04,988 --> 02:51:08,822
shot the film, the love scene,

3997
02:51:09,259 --> 02:51:09,987
and I think probably
one of the funny moments

3998
02:51:10,426 --> 02:51:12,394
was when we said goodbye
and said,

3999
02:51:12,629 --> 02:51:14,221
"Okay, we'll have sex on Monday.
Bye."

4000
02:51:14,464 --> 02:51:15,954
Okay, sugar.

4001
02:51:16,399 --> 02:51:18,367
And I get that all the time.

4002
02:51:18,601 --> 02:51:19,568
People will say, "Well, you
know, you did this sex scene

4003
02:51:19,802 --> 02:51:20,928
with a Playboy bunny
in the woods.

4004
02:51:21,371 --> 02:51:22,269
I mean, it must have been
incredible.'

4005
02:51:22,505 --> 02:51:24,405
And, it's like, well, you know,

4006
02:51:24,641 --> 02:51:26,632
it's not really
comfortable at all.

4007
02:51:26,876 --> 02:51:28,867
You got 50 people
standing around.

4008
02:51:29,312 --> 02:51:31,746
In the background off-screen

4009
02:51:31,981 --> 02:51:34,848
is Danny Steinmann,
the director, yelling,

4010
02:51:35,285 --> 02:51:37,719
"Come on. Fuck her. Fuck her.
Fuck her harder.

4011
02:51:37,954 --> 02:51:40,422
Come on. Come on. Grab her tits.
Grab her pussy.

4012
02:51:40,657 --> 02:51:42,249
Grab her ass."

4013
02:51:42,492 --> 02:51:44,585
And I'm sitting there
like dying.

4014
02:51:44,827 --> 02:51:45,589
And I'm not a prudish guy.

4015
02:51:45,828 --> 02:51:48,023
And I turned to Frank,

4016
02:51:48,464 --> 02:51:51,331
who looked just as dumbstruck
as I did, and I said,

4017
02:51:51,567 --> 02:51:52,966
"What do you want me
to do with this stuff??"'

4018
02:51:53,403 --> 02:51:55,928
And he put his arms around me
and he said,

4019
02:51:56,372 --> 02:51:58,306
"Bruce, make it look like
a Pepsi commercial."

4020
02:51:58,541 --> 02:52:00,441
I do remember seeing
the final cut and thinking,

4021
02:52:00,677 --> 02:52:02,508
"God, it looks like I'm like
Quick Draw McGraw, man,

4022
02:52:02,745 --> 02:52:05,270
I mean like, in and done.
Bang, you know,

4023
02:52:05,515 --> 02:52:07,380
it's like,
"Okay, I gotta go wash up."

4024
02:52:07,617 --> 02:52:09,551
It's like, "Ah wait a minute."

4025
02:52:09,786 --> 02:52:12,050
Of course,
I was the classic bad girl

4026
02:52:12,488 --> 02:52:17,516
so, you know, I had to die.

4027
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:19,591
I think the garden shears
through the eyes

4028
02:52:19,829 --> 02:52:22,696
was pretty bad when I went,
you know.

4029
02:52:22,932 --> 02:52:24,957
And the way they did
the little snap

4030
02:52:25,401 --> 02:52:27,767
where you could see the bone
right there and stuff.

4031
02:52:28,004 --> 02:52:30,495
But at that point,
once they put the mask on me,

4032
02:52:30,740 --> 02:52:33,675
they put the red blood
in the eyes,

4033
02:52:33,910 --> 02:52:36,674
and I can't see at that point.

4034
02:52:36,913 --> 02:52:40,405
So I'm having to be led around
in nothing but a robe.

4035
02:52:40,650 --> 02:52:42,880
And, you know, I have to admit
that was a little intense.

4036
02:52:43,119 --> 02:52:46,020
Plus that stuff burned bad.

4037
02:52:46,456 --> 02:52:48,048
I mean, really burns the eyes.

4038
02:52:48,491 --> 02:52:51,824
In the end, you know,
my death was very unique.

4039
02:52:52,061 --> 02:52:55,326
I mean, how many people have
been impaled or hatcheted,

4040
02:52:55,565 --> 02:52:56,657
or, you know, meat cleaver
in the head.

4041
02:52:56,899 --> 02:53:00,460
That's old hat.

4042
02:53:00,703 --> 02:53:03,570
You can't say another guy
has ever had a horse strap

4043
02:53:03,806 --> 02:53:05,740
thrown across his face
and crushed against a tree.

4044
02:53:05,975 --> 02:53:09,536
Some fans have pointed out
that at one point

4045
02:53:09,779 --> 02:53:10,677
he's turning it clockwise
and then at another point,

4046
02:53:10,913 --> 02:53:12,676
he's turning it
counter- clockwise.

4047
02:53:12,915 --> 02:53:13,939
From my understanding,

4048
02:53:14,384 --> 02:53:16,545
my death scene was so gory

4049
02:53:16,786 --> 02:53:18,117
with the blood being pumped
through the strap,

4050
02:53:18,554 --> 02:53:18,952
that they were able to use that
as a bargaining tool

4051
02:53:19,389 --> 02:53:21,550
with the censors,

4052
02:53:21,791 --> 02:53:25,124
and they were able to get
more nudity and less gore

4053
02:53:25,561 --> 02:53:28,587
based on my death.

4054
02:53:28,831 --> 02:53:31,800
There was a scene,
there was Miguel Nunez,

4055
02:53:32,034 --> 02:53:33,729
who played my brother Demon

4056
02:53:33,970 --> 02:53:35,437
Damn enchiladas!

4057
02:53:35,671 --> 02:53:37,400
died on the toilet.

4058
02:53:37,640 --> 02:53:39,039
I mean, that is not
the way to go.

4059
02:53:39,475 --> 02:53:41,602
Just got killed in the bathroom

4060
02:53:41,844 --> 02:53:43,004
calling out his
girlfriend's name and singing.

4061
02:53:43,446 --> 02:53:46,438
ooh baby, ooh baby

4062
02:53:46,682 --> 02:53:48,809
ooh baby, ooh baby

4063
02:53:49,051 --> 02:53:51,576
Just spikes coming through
the outhouse.

4064
02:53:51,821 --> 02:53:53,789
And his beautiful girlfriend
got just jacked up.

4065
02:53:54,023 --> 02:53:59,723
My goodness. Terrible.

4066
02:53:59,962 --> 02:54:04,092
Shooting my death scene
was pretty, pretty intense.

4067
02:54:04,534 --> 02:54:06,559
That's probably
the only place where Danny

4068
02:54:06,803 --> 02:54:09,101
actually put a lot
of pressure on me

4069
02:54:09,539 --> 02:54:12,770
because I'm riding a motorcycle
through the woods.

4070
02:54:13,009 --> 02:54:14,169
And they have the camera
mounted on the motorcycle.

4071
02:54:14,610 --> 02:54:16,840
(Screaming)

4072
02:54:17,079 --> 02:54:18,603
Danny said,
"You dump this bike,

4073
02:54:18,848 --> 02:54:21,078
that's a $50,000 camera,

4074
02:54:21,517 --> 02:54:22,882
I'm going to kill ya.

4075
02:54:23,119 --> 02:54:25,644
So you will die
before Jason gets ya."

4076
02:54:25,888 --> 02:54:26,946
Kept going around and around
and the next thing you know

4077
02:54:27,190 --> 02:54:30,023
(Swoosh)

4078
02:54:30,460 --> 02:54:31,950
The MPAA sent a long note
of changes

4079
02:54:32,195 --> 02:54:33,753
that we had to make,

4080
02:54:33,996 --> 02:54:37,124
and one of them was when
Junior's riding the motorcycle

4081
02:54:37,567 --> 02:54:39,194
and gets decapitated,

4082
02:54:39,635 --> 02:54:42,468
His head can only bounce
on the ground once.

4083
02:54:42,705 --> 02:54:45,970
At the time this really did look
real, you know.

4084
02:54:46,209 --> 02:54:48,040
It's cracking and yellowing
and falling apart,

4085
02:54:48,478 --> 02:54:51,504
but it was pretty intense.

4086
02:54:51,747 --> 02:54:54,807
My death scene,

4087
02:54:55,051 --> 02:54:59,454
there was a shot where they used
my prosthetic head

4088
02:54:59,689 --> 02:55:04,217
and had put an axe
in the forehead of it.

4089
02:55:04,660 --> 02:55:06,093
I don't think the
prosthetic piece with the axe

4090
02:55:06,529 --> 02:55:08,053
made it in the movie.

4091
02:55:08,498 --> 02:55:11,092
I think it was cut.

4092
02:55:11,534 --> 02:55:14,094
Tiffany Helm did the robot

4093
02:55:14,537 --> 02:55:16,630
to one of the greatest songs,
I think.

4094
02:55:16,873 --> 02:55:17,737
I had never heard that song
until she brought--

4095
02:55:17,974 --> 02:55:19,805
she brought it in herself.

4096
02:55:20,042 --> 02:55:25,912
?. There's a man with no life
in his eyes?.

4097
02:55:26,148 --> 02:55:27,172
?. There's a man no life
in his eyes?.

4098
02:55:27,617 --> 02:55:28,777
It was cool because it
was the 80s, you know?.

4099
02:55:29,018 --> 02:55:30,986
The kill scene with Tiffany,

4100
02:55:31,220 --> 02:55:33,120
they had an idea that they
were going to use

4101
02:55:33,556 --> 02:55:34,614
a little more graphic kill.

4102
02:55:34,857 --> 02:55:36,222
They were going
to take the machete

4103
02:55:36,659 --> 02:55:38,024
and actually stab her
straight up through the legs

4104
02:55:38,261 --> 02:55:40,024
and pick her up and pin her.

4105
02:55:40,263 --> 02:55:46,099
She was like this, and Jason was
going straight for the gusto.

4106
02:55:46,536 --> 02:55:49,562
I remember hearing about it.
I might have seen some stills.

4107
02:55:49,805 --> 02:55:52,933
I don't remember if they
actually shot the footage.

4108
02:55:53,175 --> 02:55:55,609
It would have been
pretty difficult to look at.

4109
02:55:55,845 --> 02:55:57,574
Couldn't show that.
Couldn't show that back then.

4110
02:55:57,813 --> 02:55:59,974
That was cut. Rated X.

4111
02:56:00,216 --> 02:56:02,650
And they toned that down
a little bit

4112
02:56:02,885 --> 02:56:04,614
and ended up sticking her
in the stomach

4113
02:56:04,854 --> 02:56:06,151
and pinning her to the wall,
which is probably as good.

4114
02:56:06,589 --> 02:56:07,681
You know,
everybody was frustrated.

4115
02:56:07,924 --> 02:56:10,119
The editor, and Frank Mancuso.

4116
02:56:10,560 --> 02:56:13,586
The stuff that was taken out
had a big, big impact

4117
02:56:13,829 --> 02:56:16,229
on the reaction to the kills.

4118
02:56:16,666 --> 02:56:19,999
You don't get to see the kills.

4119
02:56:20,236 --> 02:56:23,763
How they were set up,
and how they were executed.

4120
02:56:24,006 --> 02:56:25,940
So that's what pissed me off
the most.

4121
02:56:26,175 --> 02:56:28,666
From the point where I discover
the bodies upstairs,

4122
02:56:28,911 --> 02:56:30,003
everything after that
until the end of the film

4123
02:56:30,246 --> 02:56:32,043
was my best time.

4124
02:56:32,281 --> 02:56:33,248
I was just so excited
to be doing it.

4125
02:56:33,683 --> 02:56:35,310
I just remember
having a lot of fun,

4126
02:56:35,751 --> 02:56:38,879
running through the woods
in the fake rain.

4127
02:56:39,121 --> 02:56:40,588
Where are you?.

4128
02:56:40,823 --> 02:56:43,053
I just had fun.

4129
02:56:43,292 --> 02:56:44,919
And quite frankly, I think
I only looked good

4130
02:56:45,161 --> 02:56:46,059
when they finally
turned on the rain.

4131
02:56:46,295 --> 02:56:49,594
(Screaming)

4132
02:56:49,832 --> 02:56:52,232
So I was grateful for,
as cold as it was,

4133
02:56:52,668 --> 02:56:53,862
I was so grateful
because I said,

4134
02:56:54,103 --> 02:56:55,195
"Oh, God, at least
I look good wet."

4135
02:56:55,638 --> 02:56:57,037
I didn't shoot a death scene.

4136
02:56:57,273 --> 02:56:59,241
It was shot up in the canyon.

4137
02:56:59,675 --> 02:57:00,972
I remember
they had a rain machine.

4138
02:57:01,210 --> 02:57:03,838
It was cold that night.
I nearly froze my ass off.

4139
02:57:04,080 --> 02:57:06,844
But what happened was every
time they would open the door,

4140
02:57:07,083 --> 02:57:09,176
and my head would come back,
the water would hit the blood

4141
02:57:09,619 --> 02:57:11,746
and so it didn't have as good
of effect as it should.

4142
02:57:11,988 --> 02:57:14,684
You could tell it didn't slit,

4143
02:57:14,924 --> 02:57:17,051
but they could have done
a better makeup job on that.

4144
02:57:17,293 --> 02:57:18,920
I lost my voice,

4145
02:57:19,161 --> 02:57:21,595
and I actually screamed
like a girl.

4146
02:57:21,831 --> 02:57:24,095
I screamed like a girl,

4147
02:57:24,333 --> 02:57:25,129
and I still get people
that email me

4148
02:57:25,368 --> 02:57:29,134
to remind me that
that scream was so high.

4149
02:57:29,372 --> 02:57:31,272
The most shocking thing when
I saw the film in the theatre

4150
02:57:31,707 --> 02:57:33,902
was my pink sweater.

4151
02:57:34,143 --> 02:57:35,337
She's running through
the forest

4152
02:57:35,778 --> 02:57:38,246
and in some cuts,
she's got this pink sweater

4153
02:57:38,681 --> 02:57:40,239
which she wore all the time,

4154
02:57:40,683 --> 02:57:41,809
and in other cuts, she doesn't
have the pink sweater.

4155
02:57:42,051 --> 02:57:44,815
I can't even look at it anymore
because I just, all I see

4156
02:57:45,054 --> 02:57:47,147
is that pink sweater
reappearing and disappearing.

4157
02:57:47,390 --> 02:57:49,722
The attitude usually
in an editing room

4158
02:57:49,959 --> 02:57:51,290
when there are continuity
problems

4159
02:57:51,727 --> 02:57:53,957
is that if there are people
in the audience

4160
02:57:54,196 --> 02:57:56,027
that are noticing that sweater,

4161
02:57:56,265 --> 02:57:57,664
they're not really engaged
in the story.

4162
02:57:57,900 --> 02:57:59,697
The bane of my existence
of that film

4163
02:57:59,935 --> 02:58:01,197
is that damn sweater.

4164
02:58:01,437 --> 02:58:03,962
And I didn't even like it.

4165
02:58:04,206 --> 02:58:06,197
Pink thing.

4166
02:58:06,442 --> 02:58:08,307
And I think the thing with
Reggie the Reckless was that

4167
02:58:08,744 --> 02:58:09,870
it was that red suit.

4168
02:58:10,112 --> 02:58:11,374
It was the red suit.

4169
02:58:11,814 --> 02:58:13,247
It was the blood of Jesus
over Reggie.

4170
02:58:13,683 --> 02:58:16,413
And I think that helped me some,
you know, throughout the film,

4171
02:58:16,852 --> 02:58:18,820
you know, to be able to have fun
running him over

4172
02:58:19,055 --> 02:58:20,147
with a tractor.

4173
02:58:20,389 --> 02:58:22,016
When that front loader hit me,

4174
02:58:22,258 --> 02:58:24,783
that was probably
the most fun for me.

4175
02:58:25,027 --> 02:58:26,324
I helped set that up.

4176
02:58:26,762 --> 02:58:28,389
It wasn't in cuts.
It was a full hit.

4177
02:58:28,831 --> 02:58:31,299
And the distance
I flew through the air

4178
02:58:31,734 --> 02:58:33,065
and hit the ground was all real.

4179
02:58:33,302 --> 02:58:37,033
So for me that was the most
enjoyable stunt.

4180
02:58:37,273 --> 02:58:40,902
And the shooting in the barn,
the infamous chain saw scene

4181
02:58:41,143 --> 02:58:44,112
which did take a few takes

4182
02:58:44,346 --> 02:58:46,314
because the first three
I couldn't get through.

4183
02:58:46,749 --> 02:58:48,011
I was laughing so hard.

4184
02:58:48,250 --> 02:58:50,445
Where am I going to do a scene
with a chain saw ever,

4185
02:58:50,886 --> 02:58:52,444
you know, except this film?.

4186
02:58:52,888 --> 02:58:55,288
The killing that was the most
memorable to me in "Part 5"

4187
02:58:55,725 --> 02:58:59,286
was, of course, me taking
the machete to Jason's arm,

4188
02:58:59,729 --> 02:59:01,390
and him falling back
out of the barn

4189
02:59:01,831 --> 02:59:03,799
and landing down on some kind
of farming instrument.

4190
02:59:04,033 --> 02:59:06,797
Tom Morga, he called me,

4191
02:59:07,036 --> 02:59:08,230
he wanted me to come out
and take his place

4192
02:59:08,471 --> 02:59:10,098
one night on the show.

4193
02:59:10,339 --> 02:59:12,273
If you watch the movie,

4194
02:59:12,508 --> 02:59:14,772
you'll see that the first guy
that does the fall

4195
02:59:15,010 --> 02:59:17,205
coming out the door,
is Tom Morga,

4196
02:59:17,446 --> 02:59:18,913
and then you'll see a guy
fall through frame.

4197
02:59:19,148 --> 02:59:20,877
That's me.

4198
02:59:21,117 --> 02:59:23,017
I love the part
where he just goes

4199
02:59:23,252 --> 02:59:25,186
right through those
(laughs) spikes.

4200
02:59:25,421 --> 02:59:28,254
I did the graveyard sequence.

4201
02:59:28,491 --> 02:59:30,049
When the two guys come up
to the, and dig the grave open,

4202
02:59:30,292 --> 02:59:32,852
I was lying down
in the coffin.

4203
02:59:33,095 --> 02:59:35,154
They actually dumped
nightcrawlers on top of me.

4204
02:59:35,397 --> 02:59:37,228
They had like
five gallon containers,

4205
02:59:37,466 --> 02:59:38,125
and they dumped them
all over me.

4206
02:59:38,367 --> 02:59:40,164
This is dick head.

4207
02:59:40,402 --> 02:59:43,462
They used this when Roy
falls out of the barn

4208
02:59:43,906 --> 02:59:45,203
onto the farm implement.

4209
02:59:45,441 --> 02:59:48,376
It's really freaky,
really strange.

4210
02:59:48,811 --> 02:59:51,041
Well, you know, in "Part 5,"

4211
02:59:51,280 --> 02:59:53,214
we didn't have the quote-unquote
real Jason.

4212
02:59:53,449 --> 02:59:54,973
Jason was an imposter,
as it turned out,

4213
02:59:55,217 --> 02:59:56,275
which was a disappointment
to some fans

4214
02:59:56,519 --> 02:59:58,180
to find out that it was a human.

4215
02:59:58,420 --> 03:00:00,183
We got to the end,

4216
03:00:00,422 --> 03:00:02,413
and I found out it was
the ambulance driver.

4217
03:00:02,858 --> 03:00:07,056
That just threw me

4218
03:00:07,296 --> 03:00:08,763
because I didn't know
that was going to happen.

4219
03:00:08,998 --> 03:00:11,159
Another piece of advice:

4220
03:00:11,400 --> 03:00:13,766
Don't allow the overweight,
mentally handicapped son

4221
03:00:14,003 --> 03:00:15,197
of the local ambulance driver

4222
03:00:15,437 --> 03:00:16,199
to get hacked to shit
over a candy bar.

4223
03:00:16,438 --> 03:00:18,929
(Screaming)

4224
03:00:19,175 --> 03:00:20,506
Because chances are

4225
03:00:20,943 --> 03:00:21,932
that driver's going to turn into
a Jason clone

4226
03:00:22,178 --> 03:00:23,475
and try to take people out.

4227
03:00:23,913 --> 03:00:25,778
Remains one of the least
satisfying endings

4228
03:00:26,015 --> 03:00:27,846
in the history of film
as far as I'm concerned.

4229
03:00:28,083 --> 03:00:30,313
So the sheriff,
played by Marco St. John,

4230
03:00:30,553 --> 03:00:32,521
we're in the hospital.

4231
03:00:32,955 --> 03:00:35,253
He's now explaining
the whole thing to me,

4232
03:00:35,491 --> 03:00:37,118
who was chasing me,
and the motive,

4233
03:00:37,359 --> 03:00:39,020
and who this person was.

4234
03:00:39,261 --> 03:00:40,956
I guess when he was called
to the scene,

4235
03:00:41,197 --> 03:00:42,459
and he saw that it was
his own Joey

4236
03:00:42,898 --> 03:00:44,365
all hacked to pieces

4237
03:00:44,600 --> 03:00:46,966
Jason was a good scapegoat
for Roy

4238
03:00:47,203 --> 03:00:48,431
because he was in the papers.
People knew who he was.

4239
03:00:48,871 --> 03:00:51,897
And he whips out these clippings

4240
03:00:52,141 --> 03:00:56,373
and shows me a mug shot
of Jason,

4241
03:00:56,612 --> 03:00:59,172
Iike they got a mug shot
of Jason?.

4242
03:00:59,415 --> 03:01:03,977
And I ended up writing
the last three pages of Tommy

4243
03:01:04,220 --> 03:01:05,585
in the hospital room--

4244
03:01:06,021 --> 03:01:06,817
and I brought it to Danny
and I said, you know,

4245
03:01:07,056 --> 03:01:09,024
"Here's the ending."

4246
03:01:09,258 --> 03:01:12,091
And I remember him just x'ing
out all the dialogue and going,

4247
03:01:12,328 --> 03:01:13,556
"John, you don't talk
the whole movie

4248
03:01:13,996 --> 03:01:15,361
and all of a sudden you got
like a 3-page monologue."

4249
03:01:15,598 --> 03:01:17,190
But he said, you know,
"This is good,"

4250
03:01:17,433 --> 03:01:18,991
and he came back
the next day and said,

4251
03:01:19,235 --> 03:01:20,133
'We're going to use that.'

4252
03:01:20,369 --> 03:01:23,133
But at the very end,

4253
03:01:23,372 --> 03:01:26,273
that's when the metamorphosis
takes place in his hospital bed.

4254
03:01:26,508 --> 03:01:29,033
He comes to see Jason there

4255
03:01:29,278 --> 03:01:32,179
and then Jason
kind of disappears

4256
03:01:32,414 --> 03:01:35,872
and then he gets out of bed,

4257
03:01:36,118 --> 03:01:38,882
opens the drawer
and sees the mask.

4258
03:01:39,121 --> 03:01:41,180
He's in there freaking out.
You hear a crash.

4259
03:01:41,423 --> 03:01:43,220
I rush into the room

4260
03:01:43,459 --> 03:01:44,517
because I think he's jumped out
of the window.

4261
03:01:44,960 --> 03:01:46,951
And he's behind me
with the Jason mask.

4262
03:01:47,196 --> 03:01:50,859
I become Jason
and so in that sense, to me,

4263
03:01:51,100 --> 03:01:52,431
he's the most fearsome,
awesome, indestructible,

4264
03:01:52,668 --> 03:01:55,102
mysterious figure
in movie history

4265
03:01:55,337 --> 03:01:56,634
because you see a side
of yourself

4266
03:01:57,072 --> 03:01:59,267
that could become possessed,
if you will,

4267
03:01:59,508 --> 03:02:02,477
by this larger-than-life
character.

4268
03:02:02,912 --> 03:02:05,972
Despite the backlash
to lmposter Jason,

4269
03:02:06,215 --> 03:02:08,206
"Part 5" proved that audiences
still had a bloodlust

4270
03:02:08,450 --> 03:02:10,475
for "Friday the 1 3th."

4271
03:02:10,920 --> 03:02:13,286
As the film grossed $8 million
in its opening weekend

4272
03:02:13,522 --> 03:02:16,116
on March 22, 1985.

4273
03:02:16,358 --> 03:02:18,451
Frank Mancuso
called me late that night,

4274
03:02:18,694 --> 03:02:20,889
2, 3 o'clock in the morning.

4275
03:02:21,130 --> 03:02:22,256
He was so excited,
you know, saying

4276
03:02:22,498 --> 03:02:26,628
these numbers are like
the golden times.

4277
03:02:27,069 --> 03:02:29,299
I mean, this is unheard of.

4278
03:02:29,538 --> 03:02:31,062
Everyone is going
to the next "Friday the 1 3th"

4279
03:02:31,307 --> 03:02:33,104
based on their experience
of the last one,

4280
03:02:33,342 --> 03:02:37,369
and if they go from 4
and 5, and 5 lets them down,

4281
03:02:37,613 --> 03:02:41,640
it's already in profits before
it has a chance to fall off.

4282
03:02:42,084 --> 03:02:45,076
I would say that the movie is a
pretty substantive departure

4283
03:02:45,321 --> 03:02:47,346
from the rest of the series.

4284
03:02:47,589 --> 03:02:49,921
I think it's really interesting.

4285
03:02:50,159 --> 03:02:55,324
This film is either loved
or absolutely despised.

4286
03:02:55,564 --> 03:02:57,293
Some people say,
"You didn't even play Jason.

4287
03:02:57,533 --> 03:02:59,330
It didn't even count."

4288
03:02:59,568 --> 03:03:01,627
And they have no respect
for that particular film,

4289
03:03:02,071 --> 03:03:03,470
and they think it was the worst
in the series.

4290
03:03:03,706 --> 03:03:05,697
And I've had others that tell
me the way it was done,

4291
03:03:06,141 --> 03:03:07,972
and they loved it
and it was the best kills,

4292
03:03:08,210 --> 03:03:09,142
and it was the most exciting.

4293
03:03:09,378 --> 03:03:11,710
You know, it's personal opinion.

4294
03:03:12,147 --> 03:03:16,049
And I was kind of proud
to be part of something

4295
03:03:16,285 --> 03:03:18,446
that they were taking a chance

4296
03:03:18,687 --> 03:03:20,416
of doing something different,
you know.

4297
03:03:20,656 --> 03:03:24,615
Whether that worked out
is another story.

4298
03:03:25,060 --> 03:03:27,255
It's like "Halloween 3."

4299
03:03:27,496 --> 03:03:30,056
Michael's not in the movie
so it's not a "Halloween" movie.

4300
03:03:30,299 --> 03:03:32,494
I liked the fact that it wasn't
Jason killing people.

4301
03:03:32,735 --> 03:03:34,498
I liked the fact that it was
a bit of a whodunit

4302
03:03:34,737 --> 03:03:36,329
and nobody really knew
what was going on.

4303
03:03:36,572 --> 03:03:38,005
What the hell's going on here?.

4304
03:03:38,240 --> 03:03:40,572
The only mistake that they made

4305
03:03:41,010 --> 03:03:44,309
was giving the explanation
that it wasn't Tommy.

4306
03:03:44,546 --> 03:03:46,741
I think that if they would
have kept it elusive,

4307
03:03:47,182 --> 03:03:49,047
and you really didn't know for
sure at the end of the movie,

4308
03:03:49,284 --> 03:03:51,445
I think they could have
gone a great number

4309
03:03:51,687 --> 03:03:54,713
of really cool places
with it after that point.

4310
03:03:55,157 --> 03:03:58,615
But really, no, lmposter Jason,
it just doesn't work.

4311
03:03:59,061 --> 03:04:01,586
I mean, ultimately,
"A New Beginning," not so much.

4312
03:04:02,031 --> 03:04:03,362
There's a reason why the
next one's called "Jason Lives."

4313
03:04:03,599 --> 03:04:05,396
But, you know, in retrospect,
you know, it's glorious.

4314
03:04:05,634 --> 03:04:08,125
I had a really good time
and, you know,

4315
03:04:08,370 --> 03:04:13,103
some of it's not bad.

4316
03:04:13,342 --> 03:04:14,400
Everybody starts off
trying to do good.

4317
03:04:14,643 --> 03:04:16,668
You know, they really do.

4318
03:04:17,112 --> 03:04:18,272
And he thought he was doing
a really good job.

4319
03:04:18,514 --> 03:04:20,311
And he thought that--

4320
03:04:20,549 --> 03:04:22,710
he thought what he was bringing
to this thing

4321
03:04:23,152 --> 03:04:24,710
was going to be
a different element

4322
03:04:25,154 --> 03:04:38,067
that people might really
appreciate.

4323
03:04:38,067 --> 03:04:51,140
that people might really
appreciate.

4324
03:04:51,380 --> 03:04:53,473
After the disappointing response
to 'Part 5,'

4325
03:04:53,715 --> 03:04:56,183
producer Frank Mancuso, Jr.

4326
03:04:56,418 --> 03:04:58,545
received a directive from the
top brass at Paramount Pictures.

4327
03:04:58,787 --> 03:05:02,621
Get "Friday the 1 3th"
back on track.

4328
03:05:02,858 --> 03:05:05,224
You know, well -intended people
can make mistakes.

4329
03:05:05,461 --> 03:05:08,487
And I know
I've certainly made them.

4330
03:05:08,730 --> 03:05:11,198
They realized in it,
and the fan response,

4331
03:05:11,433 --> 03:05:13,526
that they were not happy
with 'Part 5'

4332
03:05:13,769 --> 03:05:15,236
because Jason their
favorite character wasn't in it.

4333
03:05:15,471 --> 03:05:17,234
So they had to go back
to the old formula.

4334
03:05:17,473 --> 03:05:20,499
Obviously, 5, where you have
an imitation Jason,

4335
03:05:20,742 --> 03:05:23,074
angered the fans.

4336
03:05:23,312 --> 03:05:24,404
I mean, it was like,
"Let's just ignore this.

4337
03:05:24,646 --> 03:05:26,113
Let's move on."

4338
03:05:26,348 --> 03:05:28,373
Clean house. Start all over.

4339
03:05:28,617 --> 03:05:30,448
Everybody,
let's just start fresh.

4340
03:05:30,686 --> 03:05:32,483
5 was a bad dream.

4341
03:05:32,721 --> 03:05:35,417
So it was important to me
that Jason come back

4342
03:05:35,657 --> 03:05:40,117
in a very spectacular,
fun way.

4343
03:05:40,362 --> 03:05:43,422
You know, we needed somebody
who would sort of embrace

4344
03:05:43,665 --> 03:05:45,496
that kind of theatricality

4345
03:05:45,734 --> 03:05:46,632
and infuse the rest of the movie
with that.

4346
03:05:46,869 --> 03:05:49,303
Enter Tom McLoughlin,

4347
03:05:49,538 --> 03:05:52,302
who began his career in comedy
and as a professional mime.

4348
03:05:52,541 --> 03:05:54,406
During an initial meeting
with Mancuso,

4349
03:05:54,643 --> 03:05:56,770
the up-and-coming
writer/director

4350
03:05:57,212 --> 03:05:59,806
pitched an idea that everyone
hoped would breathe new life

4351
03:06:00,249 --> 03:06:02,740
and bring a bit of levity
into "Friday the 1 3th."

4352
03:06:03,185 --> 03:06:05,585
I came to the attention
of Frank Mancuso

4353
03:06:05,821 --> 03:06:06,788
because of the movie I made,
'One Dark Night.'

4354
03:06:07,222 --> 03:06:08,780
I was not
particularly interested

4355
03:06:09,224 --> 03:06:11,784
in doing a 'Friday' sequel

4356
03:06:12,227 --> 03:06:13,285
because, as far
as I was concerned,

4357
03:06:13,529 --> 03:06:14,689
it basically had kind of
run out of steam.

4358
03:06:14,930 --> 03:06:17,797
Oooh, it's those
damn enchiladas!

4359
03:06:18,233 --> 03:06:21,327
The idea was still kind of
challenging to me

4360
03:06:21,570 --> 03:06:22,798
at the same time so I said,

4361
03:06:23,238 --> 03:06:24,899
"Well, let me see, you know,
all the "Fridays,"

4362
03:06:25,340 --> 03:06:27,399
and I went to Paramount
and sat in a screening room

4363
03:06:27,643 --> 03:06:29,372
and watched them all
back-to-back.

4364
03:06:29,611 --> 03:06:33,377
And out of that I thought, okay,
what hasn't been done?.

4365
03:06:33,615 --> 03:06:36,140
And, because I've always had
a great love of Gothic horror,

4366
03:06:36,385 --> 03:06:37,716
I thought if I could bring in
that element.

4367
03:06:37,953 --> 03:06:41,218
It's alive! It's alive!

4368
03:06:41,456 --> 03:06:46,587
Mancuso was smart hiring
a young, hip director.

4369
03:06:46,828 --> 03:06:48,455
He didn't want somebody that
was just going to phone it in

4370
03:06:48,697 --> 03:06:50,289
and take a check.

4371
03:06:50,532 --> 03:06:53,262
Being a huge fan of the old
Universal horror movies,

4372
03:06:53,502 --> 03:06:55,766
and particularly 'Frankenstein,'
that was the first idea.

4373
03:06:56,205 --> 03:06:57,900
You know, let's bring
Jason back to life.

4374
03:06:58,340 --> 03:07:00,331
Gotta be a lightning bolt.

4375
03:07:00,576 --> 03:07:03,477
Then I actually would go
to these bizarre locations,

4376
03:07:03,712 --> 03:07:05,407
you know, cemeteries,
and, I don't know,

4377
03:07:05,647 --> 03:07:06,739
somehow I just loved
that whole process

4378
03:07:06,982 --> 03:07:09,644
of writing in unusual places
for this

4379
03:07:09,885 --> 03:07:10,909
and just sort of see
what the inspiration was.

4380
03:07:11,353 --> 03:07:13,719
Originally titled
'Jason Has Risen,'

4381
03:07:13,956 --> 03:07:16,481
McLoughlin's script once again

4382
03:07:16,725 --> 03:07:19,216
focused on the Jason-obsessed
Tommy Jarvis,

4383
03:07:19,461 --> 03:07:21,793
but virtually ignored
the events from "Part 5."

4384
03:07:22,231 --> 03:07:23,892
After I did
'Friday the 13th, Part V

4385
03:07:24,333 --> 03:07:27,496
I got hired by
Frank Mancuso Jr.

4386
03:07:27,736 --> 03:07:29,226
to edit a movie called
'April Fools' Day,'

4387
03:07:29,471 --> 03:07:31,962
which, coincidentally,
had Amy Steel in it,

4388
03:07:32,407 --> 03:07:33,601
who had been in 'Friday ll.'

4389
03:07:33,842 --> 03:07:35,639
After that was over,

4390
03:07:35,877 --> 03:07:38,505
Frank wanted me now
to do the next Friday,

4391
03:07:38,747 --> 03:07:40,874
which was Vl.

4392
03:07:41,316 --> 03:07:43,910
John and I were assigned
to do 'Part 6.'

4393
03:07:44,353 --> 03:07:47,686
Pretty soon after I got word
from Paramount through my agent

4394
03:07:47,923 --> 03:07:49,686
that John wasn't going to do
'Part 6.'

4395
03:07:49,925 --> 03:07:52,291
I was at a crossroads
in my life

4396
03:07:52,527 --> 03:07:55,655
where I was trying to decide do
I really want to pursue acting,

4397
03:07:55,897 --> 03:07:57,888
or, you know, is this the best
use of my time and talents.

4398
03:07:58,333 --> 03:08:00,358
So I made a conscious decision
on 'Part 6.',

4399
03:08:00,602 --> 03:08:02,900
that, you know what,
I'm going to pass on this.

4400
03:08:03,338 --> 03:08:06,398
And they said we can't use you
because you are intertwined.

4401
03:08:06,642 --> 03:08:08,507
They wanted to kill me off
in "Part 6," but we said nope,

4402
03:08:08,744 --> 03:08:09,802
not doing that to us.

4403
03:08:10,045 --> 03:08:11,842
[high-pitched shriek]

4404
03:08:12,281 --> 03:08:14,579
One of the very few brothers
that survived

4405
03:08:14,816 --> 03:08:16,681
the "Friday the 1 3th" series
by the way.

4406
03:08:16,918 --> 03:08:19,250
6 begins
and it's a different actor,

4407
03:08:19,488 --> 03:08:20,580
it's a different story.

4408
03:08:20,822 --> 03:08:22,255
And enter Thom Matthews.

4409
03:08:22,491 --> 03:08:27,690
I did do a movie,
a horror movie before

4410
03:08:27,929 --> 03:08:28,452
called 'Return
of the Living Dead.'

4411
03:08:28,697 --> 03:08:32,633
[random screaming]

4412
03:08:32,868 --> 03:08:34,836
When Tommy shows up in 6,

4413
03:08:35,070 --> 03:08:35,559
Jason has not been cremated
as you thought.

4414
03:08:35,804 --> 03:08:37,999
His body was cremated.

4415
03:08:38,440 --> 03:08:39,873
He's nothing
but a handful of ash!

4416
03:08:40,309 --> 03:08:42,504
And beyond that, Tommy
is no longer bat-shit crazy.

4417
03:08:42,744 --> 03:08:44,974
This is between me and Jason.

4418
03:08:45,414 --> 03:08:47,882
He has now apparently not only
found his moral center,

4419
03:08:48,317 --> 03:08:49,944
he is a hero again.

4420
03:08:50,385 --> 03:08:51,443
And he's bringing
Horshack with him no less.

4421
03:08:51,687 --> 03:08:53,416
Accompanying Tommy
on his ghoulish quest

4422
03:08:53,655 --> 03:08:55,748
was fellow mental patient
Allen Hawes,

4423
03:08:55,991 --> 03:08:58,755
played by the late Ron Palillo,

4424
03:08:58,994 --> 03:09:01,929
best known as "Horshack"
from the cult 1 970s sitcom,

4425
03:09:02,364 --> 03:09:04,332
'Welcome Back Kotter.'

4426
03:09:04,566 --> 03:09:07,467
Once Jason was dead
and Tommy was still around,

4427
03:09:07,703 --> 03:09:10,069
and he had gotten out of this
institution,

4428
03:09:10,505 --> 03:09:13,338
you know, his vow was to go
and make sure, you know,

4429
03:09:13,575 --> 03:09:15,406
Jason was dead.

4430
03:09:15,644 --> 03:09:18,613
My character goes over
and grabs a metal stake

4431
03:09:18,847 --> 03:09:21,873
from the rotting
wrought iron fence,

4432
03:09:22,117 --> 03:09:26,713
and I stick it into his heart
several times.

4433
03:09:26,955 --> 03:09:28,354
Oh, shit.

4434
03:09:28,590 --> 03:09:30,023
It starts to rain,

4435
03:09:30,459 --> 03:09:32,324
Iightning bolt hits the rod

4436
03:09:32,561 --> 03:09:33,789
that's still stuck
into his chest,

4437
03:09:34,029 --> 03:09:36,691
and it kind of revitalizes
his body.

4438
03:09:36,932 --> 03:09:38,763
The Hawes character
whacks him with the shovel

4439
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:41,525
and all it does is, you know,
get his attention.

4440
03:09:41,770 --> 03:09:42,737
He turns around
and punches his heart out.

4441
03:09:42,971 --> 03:09:44,529
That was pretty interesting.

4442
03:09:44,773 --> 03:09:46,365
We made a foam rubber heart.

4443
03:09:46,608 --> 03:09:48,940
We had it so it could actually
pump off camera,

4444
03:09:49,378 --> 03:09:51,642
and there were tubes running in
that the guys on set

4445
03:09:51,880 --> 03:09:52,904
had the blood
squirting out of it.

4446
03:09:53,148 --> 03:09:54,911
That also to me was important

4447
03:09:55,150 --> 03:09:56,378
because, you know,
we've given him this power

4448
03:09:56,618 --> 03:09:58,609
with a lightning bolt.

4449
03:09:58,854 --> 03:10:01,721
He should be pretty damn,
you know, unstoppable that way.

4450
03:10:01,957 --> 03:10:05,358
One of the exciting things
for me

4451
03:10:05,594 --> 03:10:07,562
on "Friday the 1 3th Part 6' was
the creation of Jason's mask.

4452
03:10:07,796 --> 03:10:10,765
And we wanted it to really
look the same,

4453
03:10:10,999 --> 03:10:12,626
but we still had to customize it
to our actor,

4454
03:10:12,868 --> 03:10:16,531
which was C. J. Graham in this.

4455
03:10:16,772 --> 03:10:17,466
Once he turns around after
taking Horshack's heart out

4456
03:10:17,706 --> 03:10:19,799
and puts that hockey mask
back on,

4457
03:10:20,041 --> 03:10:23,101
that was the last time you'll
see me with my face exposed.

4458
03:10:23,545 --> 03:10:24,842
After that the inside
of the prosthetics

4459
03:10:25,080 --> 03:10:26,604
became pretty simple.

4460
03:10:26,848 --> 03:10:29,544
But the people, Reel FX,
they did a great job.

4461
03:10:29,785 --> 03:10:31,582
He had to be
this unstoppable force.

4462
03:10:31,820 --> 03:10:34,380
And nobody
was listening to Tommy

4463
03:10:34,623 --> 03:10:35,851
that he had brought him
back to life.

4464
03:10:36,091 --> 03:10:37,558
You're gonna be sorry
you didn't listen to me.

4465
03:10:37,793 --> 03:10:39,761
You're gonna be sorry
if you don't shut up.

4466
03:10:39,995 --> 03:10:43,453
It did create a new rule
which I thought was cool

4467
03:10:43,698 --> 03:10:45,962
only because, you know,
how do you kill something

4468
03:10:46,201 --> 03:10:47,828
that is already dead?.

4469
03:10:48,069 --> 03:10:49,832
From the opening moments
of McLoughlin's gothic,

4470
03:10:50,071 --> 03:10:51,402
tongue-in-cheek horror film,

4471
03:10:51,640 --> 03:10:54,040
fans were aware
that they were in

4472
03:10:54,476 --> 03:10:56,501
for a very different 'Friday.'

4473
03:10:56,745 --> 03:10:58,804
I had nothing to do with
the James Bond title sequence,

4474
03:10:59,047 --> 03:11:00,742
but when I saw it, I just
absolutely loved it.

4475
03:11:00,982 --> 03:11:03,007
I thought it was, like, so cool.

4476
03:11:03,452 --> 03:11:05,511
And it was also a wink and a nod
to the audience

4477
03:11:05,754 --> 03:11:08,518
saying "You're in store,
this is something different.

4478
03:11:08,757 --> 03:11:10,019
We're having fun with this."

4479
03:11:10,459 --> 03:11:12,791
Does he think I'm a fart head?.

4480
03:11:13,028 --> 03:11:15,861
YES!

4481
03:11:16,097 --> 03:11:18,827
It was fun because every time
Frank Mancuso, Jr.

4482
03:11:19,067 --> 03:11:22,036
came up with some bogus title

4483
03:11:22,471 --> 03:11:23,699
that we were making
the 'Fridays' under,

4484
03:11:23,939 --> 03:11:25,804
and he was a huge Bowie fan,

4485
03:11:26,041 --> 03:11:29,704
so every movie had some
Bowie song as the title.

4486
03:11:29,945 --> 03:11:33,005
'Part 3' was Crystal Japan,

4487
03:11:33,248 --> 03:11:37,446
and 'Part 5' was "Repetition,"

4488
03:11:37,686 --> 03:11:38,550
and we had the one,
which I thought was the best,

4489
03:11:38,787 --> 03:11:40,618
Aladdin Sane.

4490
03:11:40,856 --> 03:11:43,222
To play Megan Garris,
the spunky sheriff's daughter,

4491
03:11:43,658 --> 03:11:44,886
McLoughlin chose Jennifer Cooke,

4492
03:11:45,126 --> 03:11:46,821
who had recently starred

4493
03:11:47,062 --> 03:11:49,530
in the science-fiction
television series "V."

4494
03:11:49,764 --> 03:11:51,823
Jennifer Cooke was picked
for two reasons.

4495
03:11:52,067 --> 03:11:55,730
One, the "Friday" girl always
seemed to have to be blonde,

4496
03:11:55,971 --> 03:11:57,666
and I think that was
Frank Mancuso's desire

4497
03:11:57,906 --> 03:11:59,100
to kind of carry on

4498
03:11:59,541 --> 03:12:01,771
the Hitchcock tradition
of the blonde.

4499
03:12:02,010 --> 03:12:04,535
In my particular choice,

4500
03:12:04,779 --> 03:12:08,112
I wanted her to have a very kind
of '30s, '40s snappy attitude.

4501
03:12:08,550 --> 03:12:10,211
Sheriff: Tommy Jarvis
is a very sick boy.

4502
03:12:10,652 --> 03:12:11,584
Megan: How do you know, dad?.
What did you do?.

4503
03:12:11,820 --> 03:12:13,515
Take his temperature?.

4504
03:12:13,755 --> 03:12:16,952
Like a--you know,
like Barbara Stanwyck was,

4505
03:12:17,192 --> 03:12:19,023
or Jean Arthur back in the day.

4506
03:12:19,261 --> 03:12:21,661
Playing Megan was terrific, and
she really was a feisty girl.

4507
03:12:21,897 --> 03:12:24,730
I would say
like most girls her age,

4508
03:12:24,966 --> 03:12:27,833
she was figuring
a few things out in life,

4509
03:12:28,069 --> 03:12:31,732
Iike how to fall in love,
and how to say no to your dad.

4510
03:12:31,973 --> 03:12:33,497
You keep forgetting,
little Megan,

4511
03:12:33,742 --> 03:12:34,834
I'm the parent,
and you're the child!

4512
03:12:35,076 --> 03:12:36,839
That's right.

4513
03:12:37,078 --> 03:12:37,908
When are you gonna stop
treating me like one?.

4514
03:12:38,146 --> 03:12:39,841
When you stop acting like one!

4515
03:12:40,081 --> 03:12:41,776
I've been an acting coach
for a long time

4516
03:12:42,017 --> 03:12:43,541
and actually
Jennifer studied with me.

4517
03:12:43,785 --> 03:12:45,116
And so we knew each other.

4518
03:12:45,554 --> 03:12:47,181
David Kagan was also--

4519
03:12:47,622 --> 03:12:49,954
his character name
was Sheriff Garris,

4520
03:12:50,191 --> 03:12:51,590
and he was cleverly named
after a horror director

4521
03:12:51,826 --> 03:12:53,555
named Mick Garris.

4522
03:12:53,795 --> 03:12:55,660
And Tom inserted
a lot of those references

4523
03:12:55,897 --> 03:12:57,194
throughout the movie.

4524
03:12:57,632 --> 03:12:59,566
One was the town of Carpenter,

4525
03:12:59,801 --> 03:13:02,133
you know, after John Carpenter
and "Halloween."

4526
03:13:02,571 --> 03:13:03,833
The best I can do is call
the station in Carpenter

4527
03:13:04,072 --> 03:13:05,198
and have them
keep a look out for them.

4528
03:13:05,640 --> 03:13:07,198
And then the other
was Cunningham Road.

4529
03:13:07,642 --> 03:13:08,904
Drive out to Cunningham Road
and look for him.

4530
03:13:09,144 --> 03:13:11,044
Megan!

4531
03:13:11,279 --> 03:13:12,940
If you watch the movie there's
are a lot of little references

4532
03:13:13,181 --> 03:13:15,012
to Frankenstein, you know,
in there.

4533
03:13:15,250 --> 03:13:17,718
the Karloff, you know, market.

4534
03:13:17,953 --> 03:13:19,250
Where are you?.

4535
03:13:19,688 --> 03:13:22,156
Uh, Karloff's General something

4536
03:13:22,591 --> 03:13:24,923
There was stuff
all over that picture,

4537
03:13:25,160 --> 03:13:28,186
just signs on walls.

4538
03:13:28,630 --> 03:13:31,224
He had really done a great job
in pulling all that together.

4539
03:13:31,666 --> 03:13:33,156
Harry did such an amazing job
with the score

4540
03:13:33,602 --> 03:13:36,230
because you know,
he kept the "Friday' score

4541
03:13:36,671 --> 03:13:39,299
but he had, you know, this whole
Gregorian, gothic feeling to it

4542
03:13:39,741 --> 03:13:41,572
with what he added.

4543
03:13:41,810 --> 03:13:43,675
The score was different because
the movie was different.

4544
03:13:43,912 --> 03:13:47,871
It was probably the first one
that really, to me,

4545
03:13:48,116 --> 03:13:49,743
felt like, "Wow!

4546
03:13:49,985 --> 03:13:53,648
This has turned into
an actual movie.

4547
03:13:53,888 --> 03:13:58,655
Over the years, it's come up
that, you know, I was doing,

4548
03:13:58,893 --> 03:14:01,589
both a horror movie
of "Friday the 1 3th,"

4549
03:14:01,830 --> 03:14:03,798
and also sort of doing
a satirization

4550
03:14:04,032 --> 03:14:06,865
of, not so much the "Friday,"

4551
03:14:07,102 --> 03:14:09,263
but the kind of slasher movies
in general.

4552
03:14:09,704 --> 03:14:11,865
The fact that the characters
reference Jason,

4553
03:14:12,107 --> 03:14:13,836
make jokes about it,

4554
03:14:14,075 --> 03:14:17,169
I enjoyed,
I thought it was a lot of fun.

4555
03:14:17,412 --> 03:14:19,380
Because I've seen
enough horror movies

4556
03:14:19,814 --> 03:14:20,303
to know any weirdo wearing
a mask is never friendly.

4557
03:14:20,749 --> 03:14:22,876
Happy Friday the 1 3th.

4558
03:14:23,118 --> 03:14:24,949
The object of the game
is to find out

4559
03:14:25,186 --> 03:14:28,053
which cabin Jason is in!

4560
03:14:28,289 --> 03:14:29,278
What if it's that guy, Jason?.

4561
03:14:29,724 --> 03:14:31,191
I don't wanna know.

4562
03:14:31,426 --> 03:14:33,018
It was real. Just like on TV!

4563
03:14:33,261 --> 03:14:35,752
I think we're dead meat.

4564
03:14:35,997 --> 03:14:39,160
Sowhat were you gonna be
when you grew up?.

4565
03:14:39,401 --> 03:14:42,996
Some folks have
a strange idea of entertainment.

4566
03:14:43,238 --> 03:14:45,706
It was a way of really
kind of having fun

4567
03:14:45,940 --> 03:14:47,965
and involving the fans.

4568
03:14:48,209 --> 03:14:50,700
Tommy's very bizarre
sense of humor

4569
03:14:50,945 --> 03:14:53,004
really shines through, I think.

4570
03:14:53,248 --> 03:14:55,682
But, yet, a fondness.

4571
03:14:55,917 --> 03:14:57,851
You know I found out
years later,

4572
03:14:58,086 --> 03:15:01,021
meeting Kevin Williamson,

4573
03:15:01,256 --> 03:15:05,022
that that did have an influence
on him for "Scream."

4574
03:15:05,260 --> 03:15:07,888
Killer: Name the killer
in "Friday the 1 3th."

4575
03:15:08,129 --> 03:15:10,791
Casey: Jason! Jason! Jason!

4576
03:15:11,032 --> 03:15:13,967
Everyone was, you know,
very fun and wholesome kids,

4577
03:15:14,202 --> 03:15:15,760
you know, innocent.

4578
03:15:16,004 --> 03:15:18,131
For the roles of likeable
camp leaders Darren and Lizbeth,

4579
03:15:18,373 --> 03:15:20,705
McLoughlin cast his wife Nancy

4580
03:15:20,942 --> 03:15:23,410
and a young actor who would
find out-of-this-world success

4581
03:15:23,845 --> 03:15:25,870
after his brief encounter
with Jason.

4582
03:15:26,114 --> 03:15:27,843
The big discovery of the movie
was Tony Goldwyn.

4583
03:15:28,083 --> 03:15:30,677
"Ghost."

4584
03:15:30,919 --> 03:15:35,856
He became famous
for the movie "Ghost."

4585
03:15:36,091 --> 03:15:38,184
The thing that Tommy brought him
back to life with

4586
03:15:38,426 --> 03:15:41,020
is this spear that he yanked
off of a fence.

4587
03:15:41,262 --> 03:15:44,129
So once Jason had that,

4588
03:15:44,365 --> 03:15:48,927
he had something to spear both
Tony Goldwyn and Nancy with.

4589
03:15:49,170 --> 03:15:51,900
(Screams)

4590
03:15:52,140 --> 03:15:56,042
My wife Nancy had a pretty
close call in the movie,

4591
03:15:56,277 --> 03:15:59,804
and it was completely
unintended.

4592
03:16:00,048 --> 03:16:02,073
She actually almost got impaled
because of the windshield.

4593
03:16:02,317 --> 03:16:06,014
It changed the trajectory
of the spear

4594
03:16:06,254 --> 03:16:08,484
that Jason was lunging
through the windshield.

4595
03:16:08,923 --> 03:16:11,915
I would have been speared,
and it missed me by a speck.

4596
03:16:12,160 --> 03:16:12,956
I mean they could
only do it once.

4597
03:16:13,194 --> 03:16:16,027
It was really scary.

4598
03:16:16,264 --> 03:16:18,357
And then there was obviously
the times

4599
03:16:18,800 --> 03:16:19,391
where somebody
tries to reason with him.

4600
03:16:19,834 --> 03:16:22,894
Please! Take anything!

4601
03:16:23,138 --> 03:16:24,105
You know,
as Nancy does in her scene,

4602
03:16:24,339 --> 03:16:25,772
tries to offer him,

4603
03:16:26,007 --> 03:16:30,774
money and credit cards
and stuff.

4604
03:16:31,012 --> 03:16:33,071
My head was submerged,
literally in the mud,

4605
03:16:33,314 --> 03:16:34,372
Iiterally with a vice.

4606
03:16:34,816 --> 03:16:36,340
And they gave me a regulator

4607
03:16:36,785 --> 03:16:38,218
thinking that would
keep me well.

4608
03:16:38,453 --> 03:16:40,921
Well, apparently regulators
don't work in the mud,

4609
03:16:41,156 --> 03:16:42,783
so the mud's creeping down
my throat.

4610
03:16:43,024 --> 03:16:44,753
The American Express card

4611
03:16:44,993 --> 03:16:46,460
was another thing that I knew

4612
03:16:46,895 --> 03:16:48,954
the way audiences
responded in those days,

4613
03:16:49,197 --> 03:16:51,290
that when that card floated,

4614
03:16:51,533 --> 03:16:53,023
there would always be some joker
in the back of the theatre

4615
03:16:53,268 --> 03:16:55,168
that would go,
"Don't leave home without it!"

4616
03:16:55,403 --> 03:16:57,132
And everybody would laugh.

4617
03:16:57,372 --> 03:16:59,306
They say that there's
always a reason

4618
03:16:59,541 --> 03:17:00,405
that Jason kills someone.

4619
03:17:00,842 --> 03:17:02,867
What did I do?.

4620
03:17:03,111 --> 03:17:05,409
I mean, I was driving.
I wasn't having sex.

4621
03:17:05,847 --> 03:17:07,781
I mean, I was with a guy but we
were doing nothing,

4622
03:17:08,016 --> 03:17:09,881
so it's curious
as to why we were killed.

4623
03:17:10,118 --> 03:17:10,413
I've never figured
that one out.

4624
03:17:10,852 --> 03:17:12,877
Jason has no bias.

4625
03:17:13,121 --> 03:17:15,385
If you were in his territory,
fair game.

4626
03:17:15,824 --> 03:17:17,485
To establish a new look
for Crystal Lake--

4627
03:17:17,926 --> 03:17:21,020
now rechristened Forest Green--

4628
03:17:21,262 --> 03:17:25,221
McLoughlin took his cast
and crew to rural Georgia,

4629
03:17:25,466 --> 03:17:28,799
where they soon discovered
some interesting local pastimes.

4630
03:17:29,037 --> 03:17:32,200
The big thing for the kids to
do on Friday nights

4631
03:17:32,440 --> 03:17:35,375
was a big parking lot,

4632
03:17:35,610 --> 03:17:37,407
and they would just drive
around in this circle

4633
03:17:37,846 --> 03:17:39,575
and drive this loop,

4634
03:17:40,014 --> 03:17:41,379
and that was the big thing
to do at night.

4635
03:17:41,616 --> 03:17:43,846
But it was kind of remote
and sort of out of it,

4636
03:17:44,085 --> 03:17:47,145
kind of not cozy,
for lack of a better word.

4637
03:17:47,388 --> 03:17:49,049
The camp we shot at,
Daniel Morgan,

4638
03:17:49,290 --> 03:17:53,192
actually was the site also of
the movies

4639
03:17:53,428 --> 03:17:54,156
"Little Darlings,"
and "Poiison lvy."

4640
03:17:54,395 --> 03:17:56,158
6 was a lot more fun to do
than 5.

4641
03:17:56,397 --> 03:17:59,093
I think everybody else
was happy.

4642
03:17:59,334 --> 03:18:00,528
You had Tom McLoughlin,
who I think is a real director.

4643
03:18:00,969 --> 03:18:03,437
It really was like a family.

4644
03:18:03,872 --> 03:18:06,363
When you film something
on location,

4645
03:18:06,608 --> 03:18:09,168
you tend to get to know
the cast and crew a lot better

4646
03:18:09,410 --> 03:18:11,503
than you would if you
were filming at a movie studio

4647
03:18:11,946 --> 03:18:13,379
where you get to go home
every night.

4648
03:18:13,615 --> 03:18:16,243
It's not love, it's location
because everybody...

4649
03:18:16,484 --> 03:18:20,284
I was the den mother, and they'd
come with these huge crushes.

4650
03:18:20,521 --> 03:18:23,115
She was great.
She took care of everybody.

4651
03:18:23,358 --> 03:18:25,349
She was mothering everyone
from the beginning.

4652
03:18:25,593 --> 03:18:28,494
Absolutely. I'm glad
she survived the movie.

4653
03:18:28,930 --> 03:18:31,023
because that spear could have
gone right through her.

4654
03:18:31,266 --> 03:18:33,166
By a speck!

4655
03:18:33,401 --> 03:18:34,993
I just had such fun.

4656
03:18:35,236 --> 03:18:36,430
I mean, it's like
a big improvisation.

4657
03:18:36,671 --> 03:18:39,299
With Tom's words.

4658
03:18:39,540 --> 03:18:42,976
He was filming a film
that took place in a camp,

4659
03:18:43,211 --> 03:18:45,873
and it was like he was running
a camp for wayward actors.

4660
03:18:46,114 --> 03:18:49,083
Despite the congenial,
family-like atmosphere,

4661
03:18:49,317 --> 03:18:51,547
not everyone supported the
director's artistic aspirations

4662
03:18:51,986 --> 03:18:53,510
for the film.

4663
03:18:53,955 --> 03:18:56,082
There was a man who, Don Behrns,

4664
03:18:56,324 --> 03:18:59,293
who was a little on the
cheap side.

4665
03:18:59,527 --> 03:19:01,461
The first horror film
I ever worked on

4666
03:19:01,696 --> 03:19:04,130
was "Halloween 1,"

4667
03:19:04,365 --> 03:19:06,458
which nobody ever knew
was going to be

4668
03:19:06,701 --> 03:19:08,601
the big success that it was.

4669
03:19:09,037 --> 03:19:11,938
He, you know, certainly
had a past with doing, you know,

4670
03:19:12,173 --> 03:19:14,937
horror movies and things so he
seemed like the right candidate.

4671
03:19:15,176 --> 03:19:18,168
And, at the time, you know,
he made me very angry

4672
03:19:18,413 --> 03:19:21,109
because as the writer/director,
you know, you had a vision.

4673
03:19:21,349 --> 03:19:23,078
Everything was nickel and
diming, nickel and diming.

4674
03:19:23,318 --> 03:19:24,910
If I wanted a crane shot
for this,

4675
03:19:25,153 --> 03:19:26,120
or I wanted this for this,

4676
03:19:26,354 --> 03:19:28,515
and many times I showed up
on the set,

4677
03:19:28,957 --> 03:19:31,118
and it's like, "Where is it?. "

4678
03:19:31,359 --> 03:19:33,327
It's like, "Oh, yeah.
I forgot to tell you."

4679
03:19:33,561 --> 03:19:36,291
You know I wanted to kill him.

4680
03:19:36,531 --> 03:19:40,058
He said, "By any chance,
you got a deal with Frank,

4681
03:19:40,301 --> 03:19:42,701
do you get a bonus for getting
this picture done on time?. "

4682
03:19:43,137 --> 03:19:44,934
I said, "Yes, I do."

4683
03:19:45,173 --> 03:19:47,198
At the end of the day,
you know,

4684
03:19:47,442 --> 03:19:50,104
every time
you have a restriction,

4685
03:19:50,345 --> 03:19:52,142
you have to come up
with something else.

4686
03:19:52,380 --> 03:19:54,610
And lots of times you come up
with something better.

4687
03:19:55,049 --> 03:19:58,018
By the time cameras rolled
in January 1 986,

4688
03:19:58,252 --> 03:20:00,584
McLoughlin had surrounded
himself with a loyal crew

4689
03:20:01,022 --> 03:20:03,456
and a likeable ensemble cast,

4690
03:20:03,691 --> 03:20:07,286
several of whom were recruited
from his comedy and mime days.

4691
03:20:07,528 --> 03:20:11,055
Tom McLoughlin wanted to
cast experienced actors

4692
03:20:11,299 --> 03:20:13,267
in the first scene
that he shot in this movie

4693
03:20:13,501 --> 03:20:15,731
because he wanted to be
ahead of schedule.

4694
03:20:16,170 --> 03:20:17,501
It was a fairly complicated
scene.

4695
03:20:17,739 --> 03:20:19,104
We were all being beheaded.

4696
03:20:19,340 --> 03:20:22,275
I knew Tom
from the LA Mime Company.

4697
03:20:22,510 --> 03:20:23,477
He was the director
of the LA Mime Company,

4698
03:20:23,711 --> 03:20:25,338
and I was a mime in there.

4699
03:20:25,580 --> 03:20:27,047
And when he was going to do
this film,

4700
03:20:27,281 --> 03:20:28,680
he talked to me.

4701
03:20:29,117 --> 03:20:30,084
"Well, I have a part
I'd like you to do."

4702
03:20:30,318 --> 03:20:31,285
And I said, "Oh, great.
Do I get killed??"'

4703
03:20:31,519 --> 03:20:33,510
He said, "Yes."

4704
03:20:33,755 --> 03:20:35,017
We actually were playing
paintball, and it really hurts.

4705
03:20:35,256 --> 03:20:38,123
After I got off a great shot,

4706
03:20:38,359 --> 03:20:41,522
I made the men put on headbands
that said "Dead."

4707
03:20:41,763 --> 03:20:45,096
Don't be spoilsports.
Put on your headbands.

4708
03:20:45,333 --> 03:20:47,426
(whispering) A foreshadowing
of things to come.

4709
03:20:47,668 --> 03:20:50,034
One of my favorite kills in 6

4710
03:20:50,271 --> 03:20:53,399
was the sort of misogynist guy
with the machete

4711
03:20:53,641 --> 03:20:56,235
who has the machete,
and he's hacking the branches

4712
03:20:56,477 --> 03:20:58,308
and complaining about
women should, you know,

4713
03:20:58,546 --> 03:21:00,104
stay in the kitchen.

4714
03:21:00,348 --> 03:21:03,249
She should've stayed in the
kitchen where she belongs!

4715
03:21:03,484 --> 03:21:05,543
A woman shouldn't
even be allowed in these games!

4716
03:21:05,787 --> 03:21:08,756
And then Jason grabs his arm
and throws him against the tree,

4717
03:21:09,190 --> 03:21:10,782
and he winds up
hitting the tree

4718
03:21:11,225 --> 03:21:13,352
and his head goes back,

4719
03:21:13,594 --> 03:21:17,223
and there's like a bloody
smiley face on the tree,

4720
03:21:17,465 --> 03:21:19,763
and you see Jason holding his
arm that's been severed

4721
03:21:20,201 --> 03:21:21,293
from the rest of his body.

4722
03:21:21,536 --> 03:21:22,662
And then it was a question
of going,

4723
03:21:23,104 --> 03:21:24,765
Okay, you know,
we've seen decapitations,

4724
03:21:25,206 --> 03:21:26,537
you know, how do we take it
one more step?.

4725
03:21:26,774 --> 03:21:29,140
Okay, let's do three in one.

4726
03:21:29,377 --> 03:21:31,504
You know, so that three heads
went at the same time.

4727
03:21:31,746 --> 03:21:34,044
Jim Gill, who now runs
Reel Effects,

4728
03:21:34,282 --> 03:21:36,546
did this really cool gag where

4729
03:21:36,784 --> 03:21:39,412
as the idea was
as we passed the machete

4730
03:21:39,654 --> 03:21:42,817
across the three
artificial dummies,

4731
03:21:43,257 --> 03:21:45,623
a trip mechanism would
perfectly send the heads off

4732
03:21:45,860 --> 03:21:47,191
at the right time.

4733
03:21:47,428 --> 03:21:49,692
It was really authentic,
really excellent.

4734
03:21:50,131 --> 03:21:52,190
Then we made the legs so they
would buckle at the knees

4735
03:21:52,433 --> 03:21:53,297
and collapse out of frame.

4736
03:21:53,534 --> 03:21:55,502
A lot of work went into that.

4737
03:21:55,736 --> 03:21:59,570
And the rating system
made them cut that back.

4738
03:21:59,807 --> 03:22:01,832
The head was so realistic.

4739
03:22:02,276 --> 03:22:06,508
The eyes,
I had more hair at the time.

4740
03:22:06,747 --> 03:22:10,148
It wasn't
until the first screening

4741
03:22:10,384 --> 03:22:13,478
about two minutes
before that scene came on

4742
03:22:13,721 --> 03:22:16,087
and someone on the crew
leaned forward

4743
03:22:16,324 --> 03:22:17,291
and tapped me on the shoulder
and said,

4744
03:22:17,525 --> 03:22:20,551
"By the way, the triple
decapitation has been edited out

4745
03:22:20,795 --> 03:22:21,727
because of the ratings."

4746
03:22:22,163 --> 03:22:23,721
And I'm like, "What??"'

4747
03:22:24,165 --> 03:22:26,292
Just as I turned back to watch
the machete go up,

4748
03:22:26,534 --> 03:22:29,162
and I think you see the bodies
crumple by frame,

4749
03:22:29,403 --> 03:22:31,303
and I remember thinking,
"Wow. What a shame."

4750
03:22:31,539 --> 03:22:34,167
When he fires the paintball
thing to Jason,

4751
03:22:34,408 --> 03:22:36,467
and Jason looks down,

4752
03:22:36,711 --> 03:22:38,679
I thought that was like
really, really funny.

4753
03:22:38,913 --> 03:22:40,710
You see me running away,

4754
03:22:41,149 --> 03:22:43,481
and Jason following me
with the machete, and I'm going,

4755
03:22:43,718 --> 03:22:44,377
"Help, help, help."

4756
03:22:44,619 --> 03:22:45,813
He's gonna kill me!

4757
03:22:46,254 --> 03:22:48,119
And then they cut away,

4758
03:22:48,356 --> 03:22:51,189
and nothing is ever said
about Roy until later.

4759
03:22:51,425 --> 03:22:53,689
"Did you find Roy?. "
And the went, "Yeah."

4760
03:22:53,928 --> 03:22:59,423
And they pull out an arm,
and my glasses and parts of Roy.

4761
03:22:59,667 --> 03:23:01,157
I'll order up some body bags.

4762
03:23:01,402 --> 03:23:04,894
There were the kids

4763
03:23:05,339 --> 03:23:06,328
and then there was
the Sheriff's assistant-- me,

4764
03:23:06,574 --> 03:23:09,168
Deputy Rick Cologne.

4765
03:23:09,410 --> 03:23:12,345
And my mail order laser scope

4766
03:23:12,580 --> 03:23:13,569
which, you know, as you see
where the movie takes place,

4767
03:23:13,814 --> 03:23:15,748
it had to be mail order.

4768
03:23:16,184 --> 03:23:17,276
There was not
a whole lot of places to go

4769
03:23:17,518 --> 03:23:18,280
and buy that kind of thing.

4770
03:23:18,519 --> 03:23:22,353
Wherever the red dot goes...
ya bang!

4771
03:23:22,590 --> 03:23:26,287
Trying to find a cemetery
that would allow us to shoot,

4772
03:23:26,527 --> 03:23:27,858
even though we were calling
the movie Aladdin Sane.

4773
03:23:28,296 --> 03:23:30,491
'Cause that was the whole thing,

4774
03:23:30,731 --> 03:23:32,460
we did not want to say
we were "Friday the 1 3th."

4775
03:23:32,700 --> 03:23:35,430
Old Madison Cemetery,
where we finally got permission,

4776
03:23:35,670 --> 03:23:38,798
and we had one area where we
could drive the truck in there

4777
03:23:39,240 --> 03:23:40,502
90 miles an hour
over the train tracks

4778
03:23:40,741 --> 03:23:41,639
and into there.

4779
03:23:41,876 --> 03:23:43,707
There was an entrance made

4780
03:23:43,945 --> 03:23:46,641
so it looked like the front
of the cemetery.

4781
03:23:46,881 --> 03:23:50,681
And then the rest of it
was staying on the paths

4782
03:23:50,918 --> 03:23:52,818
until the point
where he gets tackled

4783
03:23:53,254 --> 03:23:54,687
and then that was kind of
a bare area.

4784
03:23:54,922 --> 03:23:57,686
But like anything else
in movies,

4785
03:23:57,925 --> 03:24:00,223
you're given permission
to do something,

4786
03:24:00,461 --> 03:24:04,363
and you try to make the best
out of what you're given.

4787
03:24:04,599 --> 03:24:06,829
Echoing the behind-the-scenes
controversies of "Part 2,"

4788
03:24:07,268 --> 03:24:09,702
the original stuntman
hired to play Jason

4789
03:24:09,937 --> 03:24:12,405
was replaced during
the early days of production.

4790
03:24:12,640 --> 03:24:14,403
Originally we had
a stunt coordinator

4791
03:24:14,642 --> 03:24:18,305
who was also playing Jason,
which is Dan Bradley.

4792
03:24:18,546 --> 03:24:21,572
We started the movie doing
all the daytime sequences,

4793
03:24:21,816 --> 03:24:24,307
all the things with
the paintballers and stuff,

4794
03:24:24,552 --> 03:24:28,511
and so all that was Dan
as Jason.

4795
03:24:28,756 --> 03:24:30,690
And Paramount,
when they got the dailies,

4796
03:24:30,925 --> 03:24:32,756
somehow - and I don't even know
whose decision it was

4797
03:24:32,994 --> 03:24:34,723
because I was busy shooting,

4798
03:24:34,962 --> 03:24:36,395
said that we're making a change.

4799
03:24:36,631 --> 03:24:38,258
"What do you mean?. "

4800
03:24:38,499 --> 03:24:39,329
"We're getting
a different Jason."

4801
03:24:39,567 --> 03:24:42,832
"Why??"' "Just trust us,
we need to do this."

4802
03:24:43,271 --> 03:24:44,795
I remember that Dan didn't,
apparently,

4803
03:24:45,039 --> 03:24:46,233
didn't look that good on screen.

4804
03:24:46,474 --> 03:24:49,341
Apparently had put on
a few pounds.

4805
03:24:49,577 --> 03:24:51,272
For a person who had been dead
for a long time,

4806
03:24:51,512 --> 03:24:52,638
he had been eating pretty well.

4807
03:24:52,880 --> 03:24:54,245
It was devastating to me.

4808
03:24:54,482 --> 03:24:55,642
It was certainly devastating
to Dan,

4809
03:24:55,883 --> 03:24:58,818
and l, you know,

4810
03:24:59,053 --> 03:25:01,715
as I said
I just was really leery

4811
03:25:01,956 --> 03:25:02,923
about who was going to walk
in that door.

4812
03:25:03,357 --> 03:25:05,587
And, you know, in comes CJ

4813
03:25:05,826 --> 03:25:08,852
who had really
little or no experience.

4814
03:25:09,297 --> 03:25:11,424
He was large and imposing,
and that's what they wanted.

4815
03:25:11,666 --> 03:25:13,497
CJ was huge.

4816
03:25:13,734 --> 03:25:16,362
He looked the part,
but he was a gentle giant.

4817
03:25:16,604 --> 03:25:19,368
So, frankly,
when he was grabbing people

4818
03:25:19,607 --> 03:25:20,835
and chasing us
through the woods,

4819
03:25:21,075 --> 03:25:24,374
we had to do a lot of acting

4820
03:25:24,612 --> 03:25:26,045
because he just wasn't
that scary in person.

4821
03:25:26,480 --> 03:25:27,811
He didn't want
too much of a zombie,

4822
03:25:28,049 --> 03:25:29,516
but he wanted that fear,
that anger,

4823
03:25:29,750 --> 03:25:31,047
and the projection had to be
through the body,

4824
03:25:31,485 --> 03:25:33,419
1 00% through the body.

4825
03:25:33,654 --> 03:25:36,589
Just a simplistic little
movement would create fear.

4826
03:25:36,824 --> 03:25:38,758
I pray the lord
my soul to keep.

4827
03:25:38,993 --> 03:25:40,051
If I should die before I wake

4828
03:25:40,494 --> 03:25:42,724
Many of those small,
little physical nuances

4829
03:25:42,963 --> 03:25:46,455
definitely helped add, you know,

4830
03:25:46,701 --> 03:25:48,601
that sense that, you know,
there was a machine in there,

4831
03:25:48,836 --> 03:25:51,031
Iike Terminator.

4832
03:25:51,472 --> 03:25:53,497
But at the same time you had to
give a little bit of that

4833
03:25:53,741 --> 03:25:54,935
human thought process
so you didn't become robotic.

4834
03:25:55,376 --> 03:25:59,836
Ki-ki-ki-ma-ma-ma

4835
03:26:00,081 --> 03:26:02,606
I remember my first scene,
my very, very first scene.

4836
03:26:02,850 --> 03:26:04,875
It was a back shot.
Me walking towards the trailer.

4837
03:26:05,119 --> 03:26:07,917
Where Jason sees
the Winnebago moving,

4838
03:26:08,356 --> 03:26:10,085
and he kind of tilts his head
in a humorous sort of way.

4839
03:26:10,524 --> 03:26:12,685
You know, he wants to understand

4840
03:26:12,927 --> 03:26:13,552
what the noise is about,
why the mobile home is rocking.

4841
03:26:13,794 --> 03:26:15,455
You're the best!

4842
03:26:15,696 --> 03:26:17,061
During my love scene,

4843
03:26:17,498 --> 03:26:19,796
they had a little powwow
and said,

4844
03:26:20,034 --> 03:26:21,501
"We don't have any nudity
in this."

4845
03:26:21,736 --> 03:26:24,432
so they asked me if I'd be
interested in doing it topless.

4846
03:26:24,672 --> 03:26:26,037
The contracts had been signed,

4847
03:26:26,474 --> 03:26:28,066
so that just didn't seem
to pan out.

4848
03:26:28,509 --> 03:26:29,771
The best part about working with
all the actors and actresses

4849
03:26:30,010 --> 03:26:33,411
that I worked for is we had
a great camaraderie.

4850
03:26:33,647 --> 03:26:35,740
They trusted me
which was a great feeling.

4851
03:26:35,983 --> 03:26:38,110
I'm walking by the bathroom
of the Winnebago,

4852
03:26:38,552 --> 03:26:40,417
and Jason comes out
of the bathroom,

4853
03:26:40,654 --> 03:26:41,951
grabs me from behind,
slams the door

4854
03:26:42,390 --> 03:26:44,051
and there I have
this amazing fight with him.

4855
03:26:44,492 --> 03:26:46,016
And I'm this little tiny person,

4856
03:26:46,460 --> 03:26:49,827
and I really gave it my all
and fought with him.

4857
03:26:50,064 --> 03:26:51,622
I mean, I had to take
a young lady's face

4858
03:26:51,866 --> 03:26:55,358
and slam it into a camera lens
with force.

4859
03:26:55,603 --> 03:26:58,037
Slammed it through the wall
of the Winnebago

4860
03:26:58,472 --> 03:27:03,569
where the imprint
of my face came out.

4861
03:27:03,811 --> 03:27:05,540
And how they actually did that
is they filmed it underwater,

4862
03:27:05,780 --> 03:27:07,577
and they shot it in slow mo,

4863
03:27:07,815 --> 03:27:09,749
getting--pushing through this
piece of plastic underwater.

4864
03:27:09,984 --> 03:27:10,973
John Travolta's nephew,

4865
03:27:11,419 --> 03:27:15,879
who's driving the RV,
Jason comes behind him.

4866
03:27:16,123 --> 03:27:18,057
And the way the guy's rocking
out, and listening to music

4867
03:27:18,492 --> 03:27:20,084
and looks up and all that.

4868
03:27:20,528 --> 03:27:23,725
Hey, Nikki what are you
doing back there, taking a dump?.

4869
03:27:23,964 --> 03:27:27,058
And we're driving along
and up until

4870
03:27:27,501 --> 03:27:28,160
the slamming of the knife
into the side of his head,

4871
03:27:28,602 --> 03:27:29,864
it's a real knife.

4872
03:27:30,104 --> 03:27:31,935
I mean, and he's trusting me,

4873
03:27:32,173 --> 03:27:33,401
and I'm wearing a hockey mask,

4874
03:27:33,641 --> 03:27:37,133
and I'm not just taking
a cheap shot of force.

4875
03:27:37,578 --> 03:27:38,840
I'm throwing that knife
towards his head.

4876
03:27:39,079 --> 03:27:42,640
Stein-stein-stein-stein-stein

4877
03:27:42,883 --> 03:27:44,783
But then that iconic thing
with that big crash

4878
03:27:45,019 --> 03:27:46,953
and then Jason on top
of the RV

4879
03:27:47,188 --> 03:27:48,678
with the fire in the background.

4880
03:27:48,923 --> 03:27:50,083
Literally the last shot
of the film.

4881
03:27:50,524 --> 03:27:51,513
The sun was coming up.

4882
03:27:51,759 --> 03:27:53,818
I was on my knees praying

4883
03:27:54,061 --> 03:27:55,858
that this guy wasn't
going to get killed doing this

4884
03:27:56,096 --> 03:27:59,896
because nobody had ever flipped
an RV like that before.

4885
03:28:00,134 --> 03:28:02,034
And I guess, what I heard later

4886
03:28:02,470 --> 03:28:04,904
is that our production manager,
Don,

4887
03:28:05,139 --> 03:28:07,664
wanted the swamp cooler
that was up on top of that.

4888
03:28:07,908 --> 03:28:10,035
He had little special deals
for himself,

4889
03:28:10,478 --> 03:28:12,105
and one of the special deals,
my understanding is,

4890
03:28:12,546 --> 03:28:13,774
he had this swamp cooler that
he pulled aside--

4891
03:28:14,014 --> 03:28:16,175
$5,000 swamp cooler.

4892
03:28:16,617 --> 03:28:18,175
Well, apparently some people
got wind of that

4893
03:28:18,619 --> 03:28:20,553
and got a little excited.

4894
03:28:20,788 --> 03:28:22,756
And they all marched over there,

4895
03:28:22,990 --> 03:28:25,185
and they tied it
to the top of the RV.

4896
03:28:25,626 --> 03:28:28,959
And when the thing flew and hit,

4897
03:28:29,196 --> 03:28:31,221
the first thing to fly off
was that swamp cooler, you know.

4898
03:28:31,665 --> 03:28:33,633
And as it exploded,

4899
03:28:33,868 --> 03:28:37,463
the cheers that went up,
and the excitement over

4900
03:28:37,705 --> 03:28:39,900
"We got him. We got him."

4901
03:28:40,140 --> 03:28:41,767
It was worth
every penny-pinching moment.

4902
03:28:42,009 --> 03:28:43,806
[sigh]

4903
03:28:44,044 --> 03:28:46,205
The car chase scenes
were really fun,

4904
03:28:46,647 --> 03:28:49,047
and I was pretty comfortable
doing those

4905
03:28:49,283 --> 03:28:52,514
because, I must admit, my first
car when I was 1 6 years old

4906
03:28:52,753 --> 03:28:55,722
was a 1 970 Firebird

4907
03:28:55,956 --> 03:28:58,015
that looked a lot
like Megan's car.

4908
03:28:58,259 --> 03:28:59,920
This is gonna be a hairy turn.

4909
03:29:00,160 --> 03:29:01,149
They were just looking for a guy
to play a cop.

4910
03:29:01,595 --> 03:29:03,062
Officer Pappas
was a little vain.

4911
03:29:03,297 --> 03:29:05,128
Come on, handsome.

4912
03:29:05,566 --> 03:29:08,262
And I got to say one of
my favorite lines--

4913
03:29:08,702 --> 03:29:10,101
You got a description
of the plates?.

4914
03:29:10,538 --> 03:29:11,596
I got the whole enchilada.

4915
03:29:11,839 --> 03:29:15,741
"I've got the whole enchilada."

4916
03:29:15,976 --> 03:29:17,136
Megan, step out of the car.

4917
03:29:17,578 --> 03:29:19,205
End of the line.

4918
03:29:19,647 --> 03:29:23,083
As Tommy is locked up
by Sheriff Garris,

4919
03:29:23,317 --> 03:29:26,582
Jason's primal instincts lead
him back to Camp Forest Green.

4920
03:29:26,820 --> 03:29:28,720
One of the other sort
of notorious aspects

4921
03:29:28,956 --> 03:29:30,981
of my "Friday,"

4922
03:29:31,225 --> 03:29:34,251
it's the only one that actually
has kids at the camp.

4923
03:29:34,695 --> 03:29:36,026
And I don't think
there was anybody in fandom

4924
03:29:36,263 --> 03:29:38,823
that wanted Jason
to kill children.

4925
03:29:39,066 --> 03:29:42,593
It just gave it, to me,
another level of "Oh my God.

4926
03:29:42,836 --> 03:29:44,531
Are they going to actually show
kids getting killed?. "

4927
03:29:44,772 --> 03:29:47,832
Tom spent more time
shooting the kids

4928
03:29:48,075 --> 03:29:50,009
and working on
their performances

4929
03:29:50,244 --> 03:29:51,973
in a lot of ways than he did
on the kills

4930
03:29:52,212 --> 03:29:53,645
that were going on in the movie.

4931
03:29:53,881 --> 03:29:55,212
One of the little girls
in the bed,

4932
03:29:55,649 --> 03:29:57,173
she's laying there
and all of a sudden

4933
03:29:57,618 --> 03:29:58,312
Jason's walking down the aisle

4934
03:29:58,752 --> 03:30:00,652
and leans down to the bed

4935
03:30:00,888 --> 03:30:04,051
and looks closely and tilts
his head looking at her.

4936
03:30:04,291 --> 03:30:07,624
And she just starts praying
that he's going to go away.

4937
03:30:07,861 --> 03:30:11,695
I named the little girl Nancy,
actually after my wife Nancy

4938
03:30:11,932 --> 03:30:13,331
because she sort of
represented to me

4939
03:30:13,767 --> 03:30:16,930
the sweet, innocent child

4940
03:30:17,171 --> 03:30:18,934
who believes
that if you're good,

4941
03:30:19,173 --> 03:30:20,071
God's going to protect you.

4942
03:30:20,307 --> 03:30:23,174
And there's been the other rumor

4943
03:30:23,611 --> 03:30:25,340
which is it was named
after Nancy

4944
03:30:25,779 --> 03:30:26,939
from "Nightmare on Elm Street"

4945
03:30:27,181 --> 03:30:30,742
who also had nightmares,
but that's not true.

4946
03:30:30,985 --> 03:30:34,216
I mean--but again,
if that works, we'll take it.

4947
03:30:34,655 --> 03:30:36,646
Jason can just about do anything
as far as strength.

4948
03:30:36,890 --> 03:30:38,323
There's a scene where he takes
one of the girls,

4949
03:30:38,759 --> 03:30:40,693
the camp girl's head,
and twists it off.

4950
03:30:40,928 --> 03:30:42,759
You know, some of that stuff
unfortunately

4951
03:30:42,997 --> 03:30:46,023
had to be cut way, way down
from the way we had shot it.

4952
03:30:46,266 --> 03:30:49,895
But everything I tried to do
in the movie

4953
03:30:50,137 --> 03:30:51,832
also was something
that you couldn't do

4954
03:30:52,072 --> 03:30:54,097
as a normal human being.

4955
03:30:54,341 --> 03:30:55,968
Kerry's character
was hopefully shocking

4956
03:30:56,210 --> 03:30:58,075
how badly she got it

4957
03:30:58,312 --> 03:31:00,143
and most of that
was your imagination

4958
03:31:00,381 --> 03:31:01,871
because you didn't
actually see it.

4959
03:31:02,116 --> 03:31:05,711
But you certainly saw
the bloody aftermath.

4960
03:31:05,953 --> 03:31:08,786
I remember the little girl
that runs out,

4961
03:31:09,023 --> 03:31:10,718
and she's in the woods,

4962
03:31:10,958 --> 03:31:13,756
and she's scared
and, myself as the policeman,

4963
03:31:13,994 --> 03:31:16,292
goes to calm her down
and tell her everything's okay.

4964
03:31:16,730 --> 03:31:21,360
What scary man?.

4965
03:31:21,802 --> 03:31:23,292
Of course,
everything's not okay.

4966
03:31:23,737 --> 03:31:25,796
That's just before Jason
crushes my head.

4967
03:31:26,040 --> 03:31:30,067
[screaming]

4968
03:31:30,310 --> 03:31:32,244
They did build a great head
where the brains popped out.

4969
03:31:32,680 --> 03:31:34,944
I guess the fans were
a little bit disappointed

4970
03:31:35,182 --> 03:31:43,248
that some of my death was cut
by the MPAA.

4971
03:31:43,691 --> 03:31:44,385
And then I come into the scene,
and I'm looking for Jason,

4972
03:31:44,825 --> 03:31:47,385
and I trip over something,
and I fall down,

4973
03:31:47,828 --> 03:31:50,820
and my face goes right up
against his face.

4974
03:31:51,065 --> 03:31:52,327
And that's where the sheriff
takes a shot with the shotgun.

4975
03:31:52,766 --> 03:31:54,199
Blows me back.

4976
03:31:54,435 --> 03:31:56,733
Takes another shot,
blows me back.

4977
03:31:56,970 --> 03:31:58,130
You can blast him a number
of times and knock him down.

4978
03:31:58,372 --> 03:32:00,169
He's laying there,

4979
03:32:00,407 --> 03:32:01,874
and, as far as I was concerned,
he's playing possum

4980
03:32:02,109 --> 03:32:04,805
you know, just to mess with you.

4981
03:32:05,045 --> 03:32:07,673
One of the things that turned
out wildly effective

4982
03:32:07,915 --> 03:32:08,904
was the back cracking
of the sheriff character.

4983
03:32:09,149 --> 03:32:11,379
They dug a hole
and those weren't my legs.

4984
03:32:11,819 --> 03:32:14,219
They had a guy head down
in the thing,

4985
03:32:14,455 --> 03:32:16,753
in the hole,
with his legs behind me.

4986
03:32:16,990 --> 03:32:19,083
And when I bent him up,
all he did was lift himself up

4987
03:32:19,326 --> 03:32:20,987
from a box in the ground.

4988
03:32:21,228 --> 03:32:24,061
And the idea is the actor gets
cracked backed by Jason.

4989
03:32:24,298 --> 03:32:26,892
Just that whole idea of bending
somebody all the way back,

4990
03:32:27,134 --> 03:32:29,068
and, you know, hearing all this
[cracks knuckles]

4991
03:32:29,303 --> 03:32:30,270
A little sound design,
a little screaming.

4992
03:32:30,504 --> 03:32:32,062
It all turned out great.

4993
03:32:32,306 --> 03:32:36,140
Interestingly, that scene
probably had more issues

4994
03:32:36,376 --> 03:32:39,004
with the MPAA
than anything else.

4995
03:32:39,246 --> 03:32:40,338
And it's a bloodless kill.

4996
03:32:40,781 --> 03:32:42,112
They felt
that it was too intense

4997
03:32:42,349 --> 03:32:44,374
so they sort of quick cut.

4998
03:32:44,818 --> 03:32:45,409
And we to just keep taking
frame after frame after frame

4999
03:32:45,853 --> 03:32:47,753
out of that thing.

5000
03:32:47,988 --> 03:32:50,149
So that had a huge, you know,
reaction in the audience too

5001
03:32:50,390 --> 03:32:52,950
because, again, it wasn't
something you had seen before.

5002
03:32:53,193 --> 03:32:55,354
With his undead Jason
on the loose,

5003
03:32:55,796 --> 03:32:59,197
McLoughin injected his film
with a new set of rules.

5004
03:32:59,433 --> 03:33:02,266
The thing I found
the "Fridays" lacked

5005
03:33:02,503 --> 03:33:05,165
in my form of storytelling

5006
03:33:05,405 --> 03:33:07,305
was the sense
of some kind of mythology,

5007
03:33:07,541 --> 03:33:09,509
some sense of rules.

5008
03:33:09,943 --> 03:33:11,433
And if you could somehow
maybe follow those rules,

5009
03:33:11,879 --> 03:33:14,211
maybe you can, you know,
save the day.

5010
03:33:14,448 --> 03:33:17,212
And it is just like
in ghost legends, you know,

5011
03:33:17,451 --> 03:33:19,942
is that, Jason
was never going to be at peace

5012
03:33:20,187 --> 03:33:22,485
until he was back
where he drowned as a boy.

5013
03:33:22,923 --> 03:33:28,486
And my idea is to somehow
manipulate him

5014
03:33:28,929 --> 03:33:31,227
so I can put this noose
around his neck

5015
03:33:31,465 --> 03:33:33,956
and drown him
with a big rock.

5016
03:33:34,201 --> 03:33:35,327
I think he called me a pussy
if I remember correctly.

5017
03:33:35,569 --> 03:33:38,037
Jason, come on!

5018
03:33:38,272 --> 03:33:40,467
Come on, ya pussy!

5019
03:33:40,908 --> 03:33:42,432
And then I give my attention
to Tommy in the water,

5020
03:33:42,876 --> 03:33:43,433
and I just go after him.

5021
03:33:43,877 --> 03:33:46,004
It's very visual and beautiful.

5022
03:33:46,246 --> 03:33:48,840
You've got this fire.
It's really well shot.

5023
03:33:49,082 --> 03:33:51,050
Cinematically, it's one of
the more interesting sequences

5024
03:33:51,285 --> 03:33:52,445
in any of the "Friday" films.

5025
03:33:52,886 --> 03:33:55,980
The scene
where Megan kills Jason

5026
03:33:56,223 --> 03:33:58,316
with the outboard motor was shot
in two different places.

5027
03:33:58,559 --> 03:34:01,027
All of the underwater scenes

5028
03:34:01,261 --> 03:34:02,990
were shot in
a temperature-controlled tank

5029
03:34:03,230 --> 03:34:05,130
in Los Angeles

5030
03:34:05,365 --> 03:34:06,923
well after we'd filmed
the rest of the movie.

5031
03:34:07,167 --> 03:34:08,065
And when I say
they chained me down,

5032
03:34:08,302 --> 03:34:10,065
they did chain me down.

5033
03:34:10,304 --> 03:34:13,068
I was, I was at the mercy
of the safety divers.

5034
03:34:13,307 --> 03:34:14,296
If I needed air, I would signal,
give a hand signal.

5035
03:34:14,541 --> 03:34:17,169
The divers would swim in.

5036
03:34:17,411 --> 03:34:19,538
They'd lift my mask and put
a regulator right in my mouth.

5037
03:34:19,980 --> 03:34:21,971
All of the above-the-water
scenes

5038
03:34:22,216 --> 03:34:26,915
were shot in this murky,
eerie lake

5039
03:34:27,154 --> 03:34:29,213
in the middle-of-nowhere
Georgia,

5040
03:34:29,456 --> 03:34:30,582
in the middle of the night.

5041
03:34:31,024 --> 03:34:33,925
So, that was terrible.

5042
03:34:34,161 --> 03:34:36,425
I believe we shot
in Tom McLoughlin's

5043
03:34:36,864 --> 03:34:38,832
father's swimming pool
after the fact,

5044
03:34:39,066 --> 03:34:41,864
of the motor,
the blade from the motor,

5045
03:34:42,102 --> 03:34:44,036
cutting Jason's mask,
and the blood coming out.

5046
03:34:44,271 --> 03:34:48,332
Jason has, you know,
obviously lived

5047
03:34:48,575 --> 03:34:50,839
far beyond
anybody's expectations

5048
03:34:51,078 --> 03:34:51,908
because even when l
was doing the film,

5049
03:34:52,145 --> 03:34:54,113
it was pretty much,

5050
03:34:54,348 --> 03:34:55,440
"Well, I think this is probably
going to be the last one,

5051
03:34:55,883 --> 03:34:58,215
and so just have fun with him,

5052
03:34:58,452 --> 03:34:59,942
but don't kill him kill him"

5053
03:35:00,187 --> 03:35:00,983
which is why I had him,
you know,

5054
03:35:01,221 --> 03:35:02,347
hanging there in the bottom.

5055
03:35:02,589 --> 03:35:03,283
I mean, you can see
at the end of the movie,

5056
03:35:03,523 --> 03:35:04,615
the eye opens up,

5057
03:35:05,058 --> 03:35:07,253
and the man behind the mask
is still alive,

5058
03:35:07,494 --> 03:35:09,052
and it just sets it up
for the next phase.

5059
03:35:09,296 --> 03:35:11,127
As with all
of the previous "Fridays,"

5060
03:35:11,365 --> 03:35:13,094
a number of different endings
were suggested,

5061
03:35:13,333 --> 03:35:16,268
though none were ever
quite so daring

5062
03:35:16,503 --> 03:35:18,266
as Tom McLoughlin's scripted
though never filmed

5063
03:35:18,505 --> 03:35:20,439
cliffhanger.

5064
03:35:20,674 --> 03:35:22,608
Tom McLoughlin had written
a different ending

5065
03:35:23,043 --> 03:35:25,910
where you met Jason's father.

5066
03:35:26,146 --> 03:35:28,114
We'd seen Jason's mother.

5067
03:35:28,348 --> 03:35:29,975
We understand how messed up
Pamela is.

5068
03:35:30,217 --> 03:35:32,117
Well, who marries that woman?.

5069
03:35:32,352 --> 03:35:34,377
And, really, what did he
have to do with this ultimately?.

5070
03:35:34,621 --> 03:35:36,316
We don't know who he was,
what he was, or anything.

5071
03:35:36,556 --> 03:35:38,490
So I thought it would be

5072
03:35:38,926 --> 03:35:41,486
really interesting
at the end of mine to, you know,

5073
03:35:41,929 --> 03:35:43,487
have him show up.

5074
03:35:43,931 --> 03:35:46,957
In my original script,
the caretaker had not died.

5075
03:35:47,200 --> 03:35:48,929
He was still around.

5076
03:35:49,169 --> 03:35:52,036
So he was, you know,
it had a kind of an epilogue

5077
03:35:52,272 --> 03:35:56,140
with him in the cemetery
and in walks this guy,

5078
03:35:56,376 --> 03:35:59,345
kind of an almost Rasputin,
you know,

5079
03:35:59,579 --> 03:36:01,069
type character you didn't
get to see too much of,

5080
03:36:01,315 --> 03:36:03,977
and you realize
that he's the one

5081
03:36:04,217 --> 03:36:06,344
who's been paying the caretaker

5082
03:36:06,586 --> 03:36:09,054
to take care of Jason's grave
all these years.

5083
03:36:09,289 --> 03:36:10,221
And you now kind of understand
that whatever Jason came from,

5084
03:36:10,457 --> 03:36:14,484
you know, the truly wicked side
of him,

5085
03:36:14,728 --> 03:36:16,923
was his father.

5086
03:36:17,164 --> 03:36:20,565
What I got worried about with
Tom's idea about Jason's father

5087
03:36:21,001 --> 03:36:22,332
is that if you sort of dangle
like something like that

5088
03:36:22,569 --> 03:36:24,503
at the end of the movie,

5089
03:36:24,738 --> 03:36:26,569
all of a sudden
we're trying to tell the story

5090
03:36:27,007 --> 03:36:28,531
of a 60-year-old guy,

5091
03:36:28,976 --> 03:36:31,001
and how that would sort of
circle back around

5092
03:36:31,244 --> 03:36:33,508
into a movie that we could
actually sort of make work.

5093
03:36:33,747 --> 03:36:36,079
Frank Mancuso felt that, no,

5094
03:36:36,316 --> 03:36:38,079
we don't want to split,
you know,

5095
03:36:38,318 --> 03:36:40,309
the attention of the franchise
off on something like that

5096
03:36:40,554 --> 03:36:42,385
as cool as it, you know,
the idea might be.

5097
03:36:42,622 --> 03:36:44,522
You know, stay with Jason

5098
03:36:44,758 --> 03:36:46,089
and probably
he's ultimately right.

5099
03:36:46,326 --> 03:36:48,021
The Elias Voorhees character
I think

5100
03:36:48,261 --> 03:36:49,250
really would have been
very interesting to visit.

5101
03:36:49,496 --> 03:36:51,054
That I think was a bit
of a missed opportunity.

5102
03:36:51,298 --> 03:36:53,095
Maybe the people
who didn't like "Part 7"

5103
03:36:53,333 --> 03:36:56,530
would have thought that would
have been a better movie.

5104
03:36:56,770 --> 03:36:58,101
I don't know. But I was happy
that they actually released

5105
03:36:58,338 --> 03:37:01,068
a Signet Pocketbook version
of the movie,

5106
03:37:01,308 --> 03:37:04,368
which has, you know, that aspect
in it at the end of it.

5107
03:37:04,611 --> 03:37:06,704
In a further attempt
to broaden the film's appeal,

5108
03:37:07,147 --> 03:37:09,581
Paramount recruited legendary
shock rocker Alice Cooper

5109
03:37:10,017 --> 03:37:12,042
to contribute
three songs to the film.

5110
03:37:12,285 --> 03:37:14,344
You don't have to be a genius
to take a look at me

5111
03:37:14,588 --> 03:37:17,056
and realize I'm an old rocker
that refuses to die

5112
03:37:17,290 --> 03:37:20,487
and so when, all the movies
I always try to put

5113
03:37:20,727 --> 03:37:22,388
as much rock music in as I can.

5114
03:37:22,629 --> 03:37:25,120
The music score
done by Alice Cooper

5115
03:37:25,365 --> 03:37:27,356
was done after the fact,
but it was a very cool thing.

5116
03:37:27,601 --> 03:37:29,728
We didn't mind
a little blood on stage,

5117
03:37:30,170 --> 03:37:32,161
and a little, you know,
slash here and there.

5118
03:37:32,406 --> 03:37:36,342
And so when the slasher movies
came along in the '80s,

5119
03:37:36,576 --> 03:37:39,602
all of a sudden
we were right there.

5120
03:37:40,047 --> 03:37:42,277
So when it came to writing
for Jason, you know,

5121
03:37:42,516 --> 03:37:44,108
Jason's like a member
of the band.

5122
03:37:44,351 --> 03:37:46,046
They came to us and they said,

5123
03:37:46,286 --> 03:37:48,254
could you write 2 or 3 songs
for the movie,

5124
03:37:48,488 --> 03:37:50,285
a couple of incidentals
and a theme.

5125
03:37:50,524 --> 03:37:51,786
And I went, "Yeah, absolutely."

5126
03:37:52,225 --> 03:37:54,455
Alice was incredible

5127
03:37:54,694 --> 03:37:56,685
to just kind of let us use
whatever songs we wanted.

5128
03:37:57,130 --> 03:37:59,155
And the song that he came up
with was just huge.

5129
03:37:59,399 --> 03:38:02,300
Yeah cuz he's back

5130
03:38:02,536 --> 03:38:05,699
He's the man behind the mask

5131
03:38:06,139 --> 03:38:08,539
And he's out of control

5132
03:38:08,775 --> 03:38:10,675
"The Man Behind the Mask" was
written 3 or 4 different ways.

5133
03:38:11,111 --> 03:38:14,080
We wrote a heavy metal version
of it.

5134
03:38:14,314 --> 03:38:17,579
And then we wrote sort of
a hard rock version.

5135
03:38:17,818 --> 03:38:20,116
and then we realized
at that time

5136
03:38:20,353 --> 03:38:21,342
that they were looking
for something

5137
03:38:21,588 --> 03:38:23,579
a little more...

5138
03:38:23,824 --> 03:38:26,520
a little more bounce to it.

5139
03:38:26,760 --> 03:38:28,387
And so we got together
with Kelly

5140
03:38:28,628 --> 03:38:34,089
who wrote, I think
"Material Girl" for Madonna,

5141
03:38:34,334 --> 03:38:37,167
and he was the one that came in
with that [hums bass]

5142
03:38:37,404 --> 03:38:39,736
Early test screenings
of "Jason Lives"

5143
03:38:40,173 --> 03:38:42,539
did not fully satisfy
Paramount executives.

5144
03:38:42,776 --> 03:38:44,835
so they decided to enhance
the film's thrill quotient

5145
03:38:45,278 --> 03:38:47,303
by increasing its body count.

5146
03:38:47,547 --> 03:38:50,448
And I do remember
being in meetings

5147
03:38:50,684 --> 03:38:53,244
talking about who can we kill,
how will they get killed.

5148
03:38:53,487 --> 03:38:55,182
And that's where I came in.

5149
03:38:55,422 --> 03:38:58,289
Oh Steven, it's beautiful.

5150
03:38:58,525 --> 03:39:00,789
I am friends with
Tom McLoughlin, the director.

5151
03:39:01,228 --> 03:39:04,391
So I knew him beforehand.

5152
03:39:04,631 --> 03:39:05,563
He had directed my husband
Vinnie Guasterferro,

5153
03:39:05,799 --> 03:39:08,131
who is the deputy,

5154
03:39:08,368 --> 03:39:11,860
and so he hired me to shoot
the scene we did.

5155
03:39:12,305 --> 03:39:14,205
We shot that at Griffith Park
here in LA.

5156
03:39:14,441 --> 03:39:16,841
And he shish-ke-bobs them

5157
03:39:17,277 --> 03:39:17,800
where it puts it
right through the front

5158
03:39:18,245 --> 03:39:19,610
and right through the back.

5159
03:39:19,846 --> 03:39:22,212
I know we weren't the first
shish-ke-bob

5160
03:39:22,449 --> 03:39:24,349
to occur
in "Friday the 1 3th"

5161
03:39:24,584 --> 03:39:28,486
but I think we were the first
on a motor scooter.

5162
03:39:28,722 --> 03:39:30,314
That is probably
our claim to fame.

5163
03:39:30,557 --> 03:39:31,615
Optimistic about
the film's chances

5164
03:39:31,858 --> 03:39:33,826
of playing to a summer audience,

5165
03:39:34,261 --> 03:39:36,729
Paramount Pictures bumped up
its release date

5166
03:39:37,164 --> 03:39:38,825
to August 1, 1 986.

5167
03:39:39,266 --> 03:39:41,791
Despite being the only
"Friday the 1 3th"

5168
03:39:42,235 --> 03:39:44,601
to receive the occasional
positive notice,

5169
03:39:44,838 --> 03:39:48,501
the film failed to capture
the #1 spot at the box office,

5170
03:39:48,742 --> 03:39:50,539
falling behind another
high-profile horror sequel,

5171
03:39:50,777 --> 03:39:52,768
James Cameron's "Aliens."

5172
03:39:53,213 --> 03:39:57,240
With a final tally
of $19.5 million

5173
03:39:57,484 --> 03:39:59,816
"Jason Lives" became
the lowest-grossing

5174
03:40:00,253 --> 03:40:02,244
"Friday the 1 3th" to date.

5175
03:40:02,489 --> 03:40:04,821
And I really think the reason 6
didn't do well

5176
03:40:05,258 --> 03:40:08,716
is not because 6 is not as good,
if not better,

5177
03:40:08,962 --> 03:40:10,589
but the fans
didn't really come back

5178
03:40:10,830 --> 03:40:13,264
because they felt so ripped off
by 5.

5179
03:40:13,500 --> 03:40:17,630
And then when they began
to see 6 on video,

5180
03:40:17,871 --> 03:40:21,204
that got them back
into the series

5181
03:40:21,441 --> 03:40:23,636
because they saw that Tom
McLoughlin, more than anybody,

5182
03:40:23,877 --> 03:40:25,811
brought the series back to life.

5183
03:40:26,246 --> 03:40:28,578
I was really happy with
the movie, the way it came out.

5184
03:40:28,815 --> 03:40:30,544
I'm still happy with it. I think
it holds up really well.

5185
03:40:30,784 --> 03:40:32,547
And I sure had fun filming it.

5186
03:40:32,786 --> 03:40:34,583
I never got to go to summer camp

5187
03:40:34,821 --> 03:40:37,381
so it was the closest
I ever got.

5188
03:40:37,624 --> 03:40:39,785
And I thought Tom did
a really good job on that movie.

5189
03:40:40,227 --> 03:40:41,387
I thought that he brought
a lightness to it,

5190
03:40:41,628 --> 03:40:42,492
a fun-ness to it.

5191
03:40:42,729 --> 03:40:44,321
He had a great sensibility.

5192
03:40:44,564 --> 03:40:47,226
He had a real appreciation
of the movies.

5193
03:40:47,467 --> 03:40:49,526
And as a result, we had a lot
of very good reviews on the film

5194
03:40:49,769 --> 03:40:50,929
because they said,

5195
03:40:51,371 --> 03:40:52,463
"Well, you can't really
hate a movie

5196
03:40:52,706 --> 03:40:52,899
that is making fun of itself."

5197
03:40:53,340 --> 03:40:55,467
Yet, you know,
for most of the fans,

5198
03:40:55,709 --> 03:41:03,750
it still delivered, you know,
what a "Friday" should deliver.

5199
03:41:03,750 --> 03:41:15,526
it still delivered, you know,
what a "Friday" should deliver.

5200
03:41:15,762 --> 03:41:18,253
By the late 1 980s, Paramount
was looking for new ways

5201
03:41:18,498 --> 03:41:20,295
to exploit their most lucrative
franchises.

5202
03:41:20,533 --> 03:41:22,558
To the dismay of its critics,

5203
03:41:22,802 --> 03:41:25,293
"Friday the 1 3th"
would soon be coming

5204
03:41:25,538 --> 03:41:27,438
to television.

5205
03:41:27,674 --> 03:41:29,767
Mel Harris, who was at the time
head of Paramount Television,

5206
03:41:30,010 --> 03:41:32,877
came to me and he said,

5207
03:41:33,313 --> 03:41:35,406
you know, "We're having a very
successful syndication run

5208
03:41:35,649 --> 03:41:36,843
with "Star Trek."

5209
03:41:37,284 --> 03:41:39,616
We want to try to identify
some other titles

5210
03:41:39,853 --> 03:41:42,583
that we control that we think
will bring an audience.

5211
03:41:42,822 --> 03:41:44,949
Just by virtue of the title."

5212
03:41:45,392 --> 03:41:49,294
It was essential that we found
a way to tell stories

5213
03:41:49,529 --> 03:41:52,896
that would have a kind of
"Friday the 1 3th" theme

5214
03:41:53,333 --> 03:41:53,822
without being directly
associated

5215
03:41:54,067 --> 03:41:56,399
with "Friday the 1 3th."

5216
03:41:56,636 --> 03:41:57,864
And he said, "Look, this has
nothing to do with the movies.

5217
03:41:58,305 --> 03:41:59,363
It could be anything
that you want.

5218
03:41:59,606 --> 03:42:00,732
It just has to be
"Friday the 1 3th,"

5219
03:42:00,974 --> 03:42:02,373
and you have to be involved."

5220
03:42:02,609 --> 03:42:04,304
I remember when I was a kid
going--

5221
03:42:04,544 --> 03:42:05,772
doing like the 11 :00
monster movies, and it's like,

5222
03:42:06,012 --> 03:42:07,741
you know,
kind of freaks you out

5223
03:42:07,981 --> 03:42:09,039
and then you gotta go to sleep.

5224
03:42:09,482 --> 03:42:11,541
What I need
is a Vampira cocktail

5225
03:42:11,785 --> 03:42:13,878
to settle my nerves.

5226
03:42:14,321 --> 03:42:15,379
It will not only settle them,

5227
03:42:15,622 --> 03:42:18,785
it will petrify them.

5228
03:42:19,025 --> 03:42:22,051
And that's kind of the dynamic
that I was looking for.

5229
03:42:22,495 --> 03:42:24,486
With only a title to work with,

5230
03:42:24,731 --> 03:42:26,699
Mancuso and co-creator
Larry B. Williams

5231
03:42:26,933 --> 03:42:28,867
began brainstorming a premise

5232
03:42:29,102 --> 03:42:31,366
that could sustain itself
in the world

5233
03:42:31,604 --> 03:42:32,730
of late-night
syndicated television.

5234
03:42:32,972 --> 03:42:35,566
Like the films themselves,

5235
03:42:35,809 --> 03:42:38,369
"Friday the 1 3th: The Series"
had to be made cheap.

5236
03:42:38,611 --> 03:42:41,341
And it had to be scary.

5237
03:42:41,581 --> 03:42:44,948
And I was kind of intent
on doing an anthology

5238
03:42:45,385 --> 03:42:46,943
with continuing characters,

5239
03:42:47,387 --> 03:42:49,685
so we started talking about
the notion of a curio shop

5240
03:42:49,923 --> 03:42:51,686
and what that would be like.

5241
03:42:51,925 --> 03:42:53,324
And then the idea
of it being cursed

5242
03:42:53,560 --> 03:42:54,891
and then we started saying,
"Well, you know,

5243
03:42:55,128 --> 03:42:56,425
if we had all these
cursed objects,

5244
03:42:56,663 --> 03:42:59,598
then we can go ahead and have
a great time with that."

5245
03:42:59,833 --> 03:43:03,098
So that really became the sort
of the core of the show.

5246
03:43:03,536 --> 03:43:07,097
Frank's plan with "The Series"

5247
03:43:07,540 --> 03:43:09,667
is that all these antiques
were cursed,

5248
03:43:09,909 --> 03:43:11,706
but they all could actually
service you

5249
03:43:11,945 --> 03:43:13,469
in something really good,

5250
03:43:13,713 --> 03:43:15,681
but there's always
a price to pay.

5251
03:43:15,915 --> 03:43:18,941
The allure of the object
that is cursed

5252
03:43:19,386 --> 03:43:21,547
and the things that happen
to people

5253
03:43:21,788 --> 03:43:22,777
with that object
in their possession

5254
03:43:23,022 --> 03:43:24,649
is really a terrific idea.

5255
03:43:24,891 --> 03:43:27,382
And it was a terrific
launching pad

5256
03:43:27,627 --> 03:43:29,891
for really some--some really
fascinating storytelling.

5257
03:43:30,130 --> 03:43:32,758
Lewis Vendredi
made a deal with the devil

5258
03:43:32,999 --> 03:43:35,968
to sell cursed antiques.

5259
03:43:36,403 --> 03:43:40,464
But he broke the pact,
and it cost him his soul...

5260
03:43:40,707 --> 03:43:43,107
Distributed by Paramount
Domestic Syndication,

5261
03:43:43,543 --> 03:43:47,980
"Friday the 1 3th: The Series"
debuted on September 28, 1987.

5262
03:43:48,415 --> 03:43:52,511
It told the story of cousins
Ryan Dallion and Micki Foster

5263
03:43:52,752 --> 03:43:54,777
who inherit an antique store
from a distant uncle

5264
03:43:55,021 --> 03:43:57,012
who sold his soul to the devil.

5265
03:43:57,457 --> 03:44:00,119
Aided by antiquities expert
Jack Marshak,

5266
03:44:00,560 --> 03:44:03,085
their quest was to retrieve
the cursed objects

5267
03:44:03,530 --> 03:44:09,435
before obsession and death
came to those who acquired them.

5268
03:44:09,669 --> 03:44:11,728
I'd been out in Los Angeles
for three years

5269
03:44:11,971 --> 03:44:14,963
and got an audition
for this television series.

5270
03:44:15,208 --> 03:44:16,869
It all just happened very fast.

5271
03:44:17,110 --> 03:44:19,169
Went in for a wardrobe fitting
and was on a plane to Toronto.

5272
03:44:19,612 --> 03:44:22,445
Robey, John LeMay and
Chris Wiggins were a dream cast.

5273
03:44:22,682 --> 03:44:27,016
Chris is a senior emeritus
honored Canadian actor,

5274
03:44:27,454 --> 03:44:30,014
and it surprised us when we
asked him to join the cast

5275
03:44:30,457 --> 03:44:31,651
and he said yes.

5276
03:44:31,891 --> 03:44:33,756
So they wanted to shoot like

5277
03:44:33,993 --> 03:44:34,982
this little pilot kind of thing,
which I directed,

5278
03:44:35,228 --> 03:44:36,627
and, you know,
it was very contained,

5279
03:44:36,863 --> 03:44:38,990
very small, and, you know, we
probably did it for $85.

5280
03:44:39,232 --> 03:44:41,166
I have no time for you!

5281
03:44:41,601 --> 03:44:43,796
But it communicated what we
were meant to communicate

5282
03:44:44,037 --> 03:44:45,004
which is that, you know,

5283
03:44:45,238 --> 03:44:45,567
it's going to be scary,
it's going to be spooky,

5284
03:44:45,805 --> 03:44:46,965
it's going to be tense.

5285
03:44:47,207 --> 03:44:48,606
With not a single episode

5286
03:44:48,842 --> 03:44:50,503
featuring an appearance
by Jason,

5287
03:44:50,743 --> 03:44:53,041
or even his cursed hockey mask,

5288
03:44:53,480 --> 03:44:56,745
many "Friday the 1 3th" fans
felt alienated.

5289
03:44:56,983 --> 03:44:59,975
And even cheated by its
television counterpart.

5290
03:45:00,220 --> 03:45:02,586
The only thing
that the television series

5291
03:45:02,822 --> 03:45:07,555
"Friday the 1 3th" and the movies
"Friday the 1 3th" had in common

5292
03:45:07,794 --> 03:45:10,763
was the title
and Frank Mancuso, Jr.

5293
03:45:10,997 --> 03:45:13,090
While "Friday the 1 3th"
as a title was a come-on,

5294
03:45:13,533 --> 03:45:14,625
we really felt that there
was something there.

5295
03:45:14,868 --> 03:45:16,802
There is no concept

5296
03:45:17,036 --> 03:45:18,128
that could have sustained itself
on television

5297
03:45:18,571 --> 03:45:21,631
with a slasher killer
on the loose

5298
03:45:21,875 --> 03:45:26,710
anywhere for the 76 episodes
that were subsequently made.

5299
03:45:26,946 --> 03:45:28,174
I really wish they would have
called it "Friday's Curse."

5300
03:45:28,615 --> 03:45:31,209
Which was the original
intention.

5301
03:45:31,651 --> 03:45:33,710
In Europe it was called
"Friday's Curse,"

5302
03:45:33,953 --> 03:45:36,513
and in Canada it was called
"Friday's Curse" as well.

5303
03:45:36,756 --> 03:45:39,486
It was set up in Canada
and I was producing the show.

5304
03:45:39,726 --> 03:45:42,854
And it was
a fascinating experience.

5305
03:45:43,096 --> 03:45:44,996
And we got like Atom Egoyan
to do one.

5306
03:45:45,231 --> 03:45:47,096
David Cronenberg did one.

5307
03:45:47,534 --> 03:45:49,126
David Cronenberg brought that
terrific kind of

5308
03:45:49,569 --> 03:45:52,060
Iaser-like focus on a theme

5309
03:45:52,305 --> 03:45:54,671
which so totally fit into
the storytelling notions

5310
03:45:54,908 --> 03:45:55,840
of "Friday the 1 3th."

5311
03:45:56,075 --> 03:45:58,009
And it was wonderful.

5312
03:45:58,244 --> 03:45:59,575
It was also great
to work with David

5313
03:45:59,812 --> 03:46:01,643
who's a fabulous director.

5314
03:46:01,881 --> 03:46:04,543
Frank asked me about being
story editor

5315
03:46:04,784 --> 03:46:06,752
because they had a story editor
up in Toronto

5316
03:46:06,986 --> 03:46:10,149
where they were doing the show,
and, you know,

5317
03:46:10,590 --> 03:46:12,023
wanted me to write and direct,
you know,

5318
03:46:12,258 --> 03:46:13,885
some episodes as well.

5319
03:46:14,127 --> 03:46:16,618
"Master of Disguise,"
I thought was a great idea

5320
03:46:16,863 --> 03:46:19,730
basically having, you know,
a makeup case that, you know,

5321
03:46:19,966 --> 03:46:21,058
could take somebody who was
really deformed

5322
03:46:21,301 --> 03:46:23,565
and, you know, you'd kill

5323
03:46:23,803 --> 03:46:26,863
and then you would sop up
the blood of the victim

5324
03:46:27,106 --> 03:46:29,006
and then he was as handsome
as like a James Bond.

5325
03:46:29,242 --> 03:46:31,870
And because it was syndication,

5326
03:46:32,111 --> 03:46:36,639
we literally never got a note
from anybody about anything.

5327
03:46:36,883 --> 03:46:37,645
I mean, I don't know that
anybody

5328
03:46:37,884 --> 03:46:39,647
even looked at the shows.

5329
03:46:39,886 --> 03:46:41,080
I mean, it was like literally
they just went out.

5330
03:46:41,321 --> 03:46:42,083
So if I wanted to do it
in black and white,

5331
03:46:42,322 --> 03:46:44,017
it was black and white.

5332
03:46:44,257 --> 03:46:46,191
If I wanted to do a two-parter,
you did a two-parter.

5333
03:46:46,626 --> 03:46:47,923
I mean, it was like literally
whatever we decided to do.

5334
03:46:48,161 --> 03:46:50,857
"Friday the 1 3th,"
the new television series

5335
03:46:51,097 --> 03:46:54,555
that has put real fright
into late night.

5336
03:46:54,801 --> 03:46:58,066
"Friday The 1 3th: The Series"
was a bona fide ratings hit.

5337
03:46:58,304 --> 03:47:00,738
Often ranking just behind
Paramount's

5338
03:47:00,974 --> 03:47:03,101
top-rated "Star Trek:
The Next Generation."

5339
03:47:03,343 --> 03:47:04,935
After two successful seasons,

5340
03:47:05,178 --> 03:47:07,305
actor John LeMay
decided to leave the show

5341
03:47:07,747 --> 03:47:09,977
to pursue other opportunities.

5342
03:47:10,216 --> 03:47:11,979
The thing that was the most
interesting of a challenge

5343
03:47:12,218 --> 03:47:14,209
was the third season,

5344
03:47:14,654 --> 03:47:16,815
Frank asked me if I would
write and direct

5345
03:47:17,056 --> 03:47:18,956
for the season premiere.

5346
03:47:19,192 --> 03:47:21,285
And he said, "You know, we need
to kill the Ryan character

5347
03:47:21,728 --> 03:47:22,990
because he wants to get off
the show,

5348
03:47:23,229 --> 03:47:26,062
and but don't kill him
in a way

5349
03:47:26,299 --> 03:47:28,199
that we can't bring him back
if he changes his mind.

5350
03:47:28,635 --> 03:47:30,000
And I got turned back
into a child

5351
03:47:30,236 --> 03:47:32,932
at the end of my two-year stint
on the show.

5352
03:47:33,172 --> 03:47:36,164
It was a grand and glorious
two hour episode.

5353
03:47:36,409 --> 03:47:39,674
It was a way of basically
taking him off the show

5354
03:47:39,912 --> 03:47:42,176
and, if you wanted
to bring him back, you could.

5355
03:47:42,415 --> 03:47:43,643
When LeMay was replaced in
the third season opener

5356
03:47:43,883 --> 03:47:45,009
by actor Steven Monarque

5357
03:47:45,251 --> 03:47:47,310
as streetwise Johnny Ventura

5358
03:47:47,754 --> 03:47:49,119
"The Series" lost not only
its leading man,

5359
03:47:49,355 --> 03:47:51,220
but its luster.

5360
03:47:51,658 --> 03:47:53,683
Once Ryan got turned into
a little boy,

5361
03:47:53,926 --> 03:47:56,360
Johnny Ventura had to take over
that spot.

5362
03:47:56,796 --> 03:47:57,956
Johnny...

5363
03:47:58,197 --> 03:48:00,392
Johnny was the cousin of Ryan.

5364
03:48:00,833 --> 03:48:03,199
He was a little bit more
of a blue-collar kid.

5365
03:48:03,436 --> 03:48:06,701
I don't think he was afraid
of fighting

5366
03:48:06,939 --> 03:48:08,873
and physically getting involved
with saving the day.

5367
03:48:09,108 --> 03:48:11,269
[monster growling sounds]

5368
03:48:11,711 --> 03:48:13,269
"Friday the 1 3th"
and "Nightmare on Elm Street"

5369
03:48:13,713 --> 03:48:15,874
were head-to-head in terms
of their television experience.

5370
03:48:16,115 --> 03:48:18,743
"Freddy's Nightmares" was always
a somewhat more lighthearted,

5371
03:48:18,985 --> 03:48:20,748
tongue-in-cheek
kind of a television series.

5372
03:48:20,987 --> 03:48:22,921
I think the makers
of "Friday the 1 3th"

5373
03:48:23,156 --> 03:48:24,214
always wanted it to be dark,

5374
03:48:24,457 --> 03:48:25,947
always wanted it
serious quality.

5375
03:48:26,192 --> 03:48:27,250
Because the show
got good reviews,

5376
03:48:27,694 --> 03:48:29,059
and the show was successful,

5377
03:48:29,295 --> 03:48:30,887
the people at Paramount said,

5378
03:48:31,130 --> 03:48:34,861
"lf we can get X dollars
at 1 1 :00,

5379
03:48:35,101 --> 03:48:36,864
if we move it to 1 0:00
we can even get more."

5380
03:48:37,103 --> 03:48:39,901
So they moved it to 1 0:00
in year two.

5381
03:48:40,139 --> 03:48:41,800
And all of a sudden it's like
even more successful.

5382
03:48:42,041 --> 03:48:43,668
They said, "You know what?.

5383
03:48:43,910 --> 03:48:45,002
Let's start putting it on
at 7:00, 8:00, you know,

5384
03:48:45,244 --> 03:48:46,233
whatever it is.

5385
03:48:46,479 --> 03:48:47,343
They start moving it.

5386
03:48:47,780 --> 03:48:49,805
So now, all of a sudden,

5387
03:48:50,049 --> 03:48:51,107
different kinds of people
are watching.

5388
03:48:51,350 --> 03:48:52,374
No longer is it
the last thing that you see

5389
03:48:52,819 --> 03:48:54,309
before you go to bed at night.

5390
03:48:54,754 --> 03:48:56,244
Now it's like, it's on at 7:00.

5391
03:48:56,489 --> 03:48:58,150
They stopped the clock, Lewis!

5392
03:48:58,391 --> 03:49:00,222
[screams]

5393
03:49:00,460 --> 03:49:03,020
Here you are,
sitting at home, eating dinner

5394
03:49:03,262 --> 03:49:04,752
and all of a sudden this,
you know,

5395
03:49:04,997 --> 03:49:06,328
splat thriller
comes on the tube.

5396
03:49:06,766 --> 03:49:08,700
I think, you know, as a parent

5397
03:49:08,935 --> 03:49:10,869
it would catch me
by surprise, too.

5398
03:49:11,104 --> 03:49:13,038
And with Paramount
boldly pushing the show

5399
03:49:13,272 --> 03:49:16,241
into primetime slots,
"Friday the 13th: The Series"

5400
03:49:16,476 --> 03:49:18,444
soon came under fire from
right-wing religious groups

5401
03:49:18,878 --> 03:49:20,812
who were less than enthused
about a show

5402
03:49:21,047 --> 03:49:23,106
involving black magic
and pacts with the devil.

5403
03:49:23,349 --> 03:49:25,476
I think when I came in
at the time,

5404
03:49:25,918 --> 03:49:28,216
people were already
not liking he show.

5405
03:49:28,454 --> 03:49:30,081
There was already this force
trying to get it off the air.

5406
03:49:30,323 --> 03:49:33,815
So this guy, Donald Wildmon,

5407
03:49:34,060 --> 03:49:36,028
who had like this kind of
Christian Coalition group

5408
03:49:36,262 --> 03:49:39,356
started squawking about
"Friday the 1 3th"

5409
03:49:39,799 --> 03:49:40,390
because it started
to get recognized.

5410
03:49:40,833 --> 03:49:42,164
He's talking about Jason.

5411
03:49:42,401 --> 03:49:44,460
He's talking about,
you know, all this stuff.

5412
03:49:44,904 --> 03:49:45,393
I'm saying, this guy's never
even seen one of the shows.

5413
03:49:45,838 --> 03:49:47,271
What's at stake here?.

5414
03:49:47,507 --> 03:49:49,975
Western civilization
as we've known it

5415
03:49:50,209 --> 03:49:52,268
for two thousand years.

5416
03:49:52,512 --> 03:49:54,742
We kind of all laughed him off
in the beginning.

5417
03:49:54,981 --> 03:49:56,346
But, you know, you get somebody
like that who calls and says,

5418
03:49:56,783 --> 03:49:59,513
"Yeah, I got 555,000
constituents,

5419
03:49:59,952 --> 03:50:01,749
and they're not going to buy
Proctor & Gamble products

5420
03:50:01,988 --> 03:50:04,354
if you continue to put your ads
on this show."

5421
03:50:04,791 --> 03:50:06,122
All of a sudden
it's not so funny anymore.

5422
03:50:06,359 --> 03:50:08,827
I was sad that it ended
that quickly.

5423
03:50:09,061 --> 03:50:11,757
You know I really wanted to do
at least another year or two

5424
03:50:11,998 --> 03:50:14,296
because I was just finally
getting my feet wet.

5425
03:50:14,534 --> 03:50:17,469
It's amazing how our culture
has changed in 20 years

5426
03:50:17,904 --> 03:50:19,804
and how permissive and pervasive
violence, in particular,

5427
03:50:20,039 --> 03:50:22,007
is on TV,

5428
03:50:22,241 --> 03:50:23,970
and how much it's just
taken for granted,

5429
03:50:24,210 --> 03:50:26,075
that it's just
going to be there.

5430
03:50:26,312 --> 03:50:28,473
So, yeah, it was sad because
we did, what, 73 hours

5431
03:50:28,915 --> 03:50:31,145
and, you know,
there were some clunkers,

5432
03:50:31,384 --> 03:50:32,373
but there were a lot
of really good shows in there.

5433
03:50:32,819 --> 03:50:35,253
And, in point of fact,

5434
03:50:35,488 --> 03:50:36,819
when I talk to people
about the television series,

5435
03:50:37,056 --> 03:50:38,785
you know, people do
remember it fondly.

5436
03:50:39,025 --> 03:50:40,492
But I think a lot of people

5437
03:50:40,927 --> 03:50:42,485
who were really big fans
of the series

5438
03:50:42,929 --> 03:50:45,227
didn't like the fact
that they stole the name

5439
03:50:45,464 --> 03:50:49,059
and tried to sneak a fast one
past everybody

5440
03:50:49,302 --> 03:50:52,396
and get them to watch
this hour serial on TV.

5441
03:50:52,839 --> 03:50:55,239
But it was fun. I liked it.
