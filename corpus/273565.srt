1
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,420
Yeah. You're a good bird.

2
00:01:27,762 --> 00:01:29,992
Take you home, get your leg better.

3
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:34,066
Dear William, thank you so
much for the birthday present.

4
00:01:34,235 --> 00:01:38,103
I'm so happy you remembered,
as few here at the orphanage did.

5
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:41,434
It's interesting how life
works out, isn't it?

6
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:45,204
Years ago, when you first joined
my orphanage's outreach program...

7
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,406
...I never imagined we would
become such good friends.

8
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:49,948
You have enriched my life.

9
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,545
And for doing this,
I'm eternally grateful.

10
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:57,520
Hope all is going well
on the wildlife refuge.

11
00:01:57,692 --> 00:02:00,092
-Please write again soon.
-How are you feeling?

12
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:02,491
I do so look forward to your letters.

13
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:06,156
Always your friend,
Irena Morawska.

14
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:12,099
Dear Irena...

15
00:02:12,273 --> 00:02:14,969
...I'm glad you like
the American Indian bracelet...

16
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:17,771
...a true symbol of our friendship.

17
00:02:17,945 --> 00:02:21,381
At the same time, it pains me
that others at the orphanage...

18
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:24,347
...failed to recognize
your special day.

19
00:02:24,952 --> 00:02:27,614
You're an intelligent, special girl.

20
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:30,053
So trust me when I tell you this:

21
00:02:30,224 --> 00:02:31,851
Pave your own path.

22
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,426
Do not wait for others to lead you.

23
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:36,859
You'll benefit more in the end.

24
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:41,263
By the way, you've done well with
the tracker puzzles I've sent you.

25
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:46,237
Over the next couple of letters, I'll
send ones that are more challenging.

26
00:02:47,175 --> 00:02:49,040
This one's called a cipher.

27
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:53,078
Like I said, it's more advanced,
but I am sure you'll catch on quick.

28
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:54,475
William.

29
00:02:54,649 --> 00:02:56,514
Friends forever.

30
00:02:59,854 --> 00:03:02,516
Here's another cipher
for you to try and solve.

31
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:06,552
Remember Napoleon,
the great general, once wrote:

32
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,596
''He who fears being conquered
is sure of defeat. ''

33
00:03:10,765 --> 00:03:14,997
I suppose I'm just trying to say
that we can rise above our problems.

34
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:18,536
The answers are all there
if we look close enough.

35
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,808
-Be strong.
-Watch where you go.

36
00:03:21,976 --> 00:03:25,605
In six months, I will be 14
and have to leave the orphanage.

37
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,680
I'm not sure where to go after that.

38
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:29,908
Still, as you have taught me...

39
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,678
...I can see opportunity in all things.

40
00:03:34,522 --> 00:03:38,390
Mrs. Donata told me she has
big plans for me and not to worry.

41
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:42,393
Whatever happens, I know that
you and I will remain connected.

42
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,724
Irena.

43
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:46,663
Anything else?

44
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:49,166
Thank you, Rosie.
Do you know any good jokes?

45
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:52,835
Guess that means no.

46
00:03:55,076 --> 00:03:58,876
-Cup of coffee?
-Just give me whatever he's having.

47
00:03:59,046 --> 00:04:00,604
Look what the cat drug in.

48
00:04:04,018 --> 00:04:07,954
-You thought you'd never see me here.
-l was hoping l wouldn't, you know.

49
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,521
But shit happens.

50
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,626
Old Shepherd talked about the mighty
shit you once did for the government.

51
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:15,387
But that's in the past.

52
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:17,990
We're living in the here and now.

53
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:24,901
You saved my ass a few times,
as l recall.

54
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:27,138
l owe you one, Billy.

55
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,575
Well, let's just call it even.

56
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,410
No way.

57
00:05:33,507 --> 00:05:35,236
l'll count to 10.

58
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:38,742
Let's see how far you can run
before l catch you.

59
00:05:38,913 --> 00:05:40,403
One...

60
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,476
...two, three....

61
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,184
The thrill of the chase, Mrs. Donata.

62
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:51,484
lt's always a constant source
of amusement to me.

63
00:05:52,593 --> 00:05:53,890
Dear Irena...

64
00:05:54,061 --> 00:05:56,859
...I may have to go away
for a while, but don't worry.

65
00:05:57,031 --> 00:06:00,228
You can contact me in Montreal
at the address below.

66
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:03,702
It's hidden in a cipher
called zodiac.

67
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,537
Remember Napoleon and be strong.

68
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:31,096
Ania Brotzcha.

69
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,597
Mata Majerska.

70
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,998
lrena Morawska.

71
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,502
Annoucheka Ravinska.

72
00:06:38,673 --> 00:06:41,073
You've all dreamed of homes...

73
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:43,836
...families and a better life.

74
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,240
Well, dreams can come true.

75
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:52,151
lt's my job to expedite such dreams.

76
00:07:16,944 --> 00:07:18,241
Poland.

77
00:07:18,412 --> 00:07:21,472
lf you could be anything,
what would you like to be?

78
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,310
A model. ln a magazine.

79
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:24,951
A model?

80
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,645
Well, you're not exactly
model material.

81
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,721
Still....

82
00:07:38,265 --> 00:07:40,859
And you, what would you like to be?

83
00:07:41,035 --> 00:07:42,900
A good student, sir.

84
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,840
Lord have mercy. What a mess.

85
00:07:57,752 --> 00:07:59,344
How do you want to play this?

86
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,715
Doesn't have to be difficult, William.

87
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:03,618
Just need to talk.

88
00:08:06,927 --> 00:08:08,451
Well, l'll tell you what.

89
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:12,727
Play this by the books for me...

90
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,893
...and l'll come peacefully.

91
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,662
Sure. By the book.

92
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:21,296
lt's nothing personal.
lt's just too many loose ends.

93
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:24,143
Cabin's a nice touch.

94
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:27,508
You know, l built this cabin
with my own money.

95
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,444
Glad to see you saved.

96
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:31,016
That was smart.

97
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:33,913
Bring William to the van.

98
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,420
Take him.

99
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:49,893
Put the gun down, Shepherd.

100
00:08:53,474 --> 00:08:55,499
Set it down very gently.

101
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,048
Now, get over here.

102
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:06,351
Very good.

103
00:09:07,221 --> 00:09:09,553
Now l want you to turn around.

104
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,839
lt doesn't matter how far
a man runs.

105
00:09:27,007 --> 00:09:28,668
He can't run away from himself.

106
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:30,811
You're still a company man, William.

107
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:32,946
And we will find you.

108
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,350
lt's time to leave, lrena.

109
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:49,661
My American friend.

110
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:52,060
Will you make sure
that he receives this?

111
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:23,491
Oh, that's funny.

112
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,632
Okay, l gotta go. Bye.

113
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,027
Mr. Delacroix?

114
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,701
Anything in the box for Lansing?

115
00:10:33,874 --> 00:10:35,398
Let's take a look.

116
00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:41,210
l'm afraid only one this time.

117
00:10:57,798 --> 00:11:00,596
Dear Mr. Lansing,
we regret to inform you...

118
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:04,704
...that Irena Morawska will no longer
be able to correspond with you.

119
00:11:55,723 --> 00:11:57,156
Let me have your bag.

120
00:11:57,691 --> 00:11:59,420
Be better for the photo.

121
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:03,796
All right.

122
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:05,988
You can smile a bit.

123
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:09,865
All right.

124
00:12:13,574 --> 00:12:16,008
What kind of foster program is this?

125
00:12:16,176 --> 00:12:17,871
lt's a special program...

126
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:19,844
...for very talented kids.

127
00:12:20,014 --> 00:12:21,709
Good students, like you.

128
00:12:25,052 --> 00:12:26,883
What do we have here?

129
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:28,749
A letter from America, huh?

130
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:30,549
Those are mine.

131
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,422
Burn these.

132
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,327
What do we have here?

133
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,733
l haven't seen a cipher like this...

134
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,303
...in a long time.

135
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:50,507
l think we will call her Lola.

136
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:52,976
-Lola?
-Lola.

137
00:12:53,747 --> 00:12:55,374
l like Lola.

138
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,098
Whenever you're ready.

139
00:13:12,266 --> 00:13:16,669
And just remember to look
right into the lens, okay?

140
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:26,539
My name is Annoucheka.

141
00:13:26,714 --> 00:13:29,114
When l grow up,
l want to be a model.

142
00:13:32,553 --> 00:13:34,350
Go on. You're doing fine. Go on.

143
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:36,113
A model.

144
00:13:36,824 --> 00:13:38,052
No!

145
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,252
All professional models
suffer from stage fright.

146
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:04,116
Welcome to Poland, Mr. Davenport.
Are you here for business or pleasure?

147
00:14:04,284 --> 00:14:05,945
A little sightseeing.

148
00:14:06,553 --> 00:14:09,454
This doesn't look like
a modeling agency to me.

149
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:11,784
Annoucheka, what are you thinking?

150
00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:13,483
Be careful.

151
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,692
Annoucheka, no. Please don't.

152
00:15:06,747 --> 00:15:10,342
You can try to run,
but there's nowhere to hide.

153
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:15,683
And now, l am forced into making
an example of you.

154
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:32,399
You're fast.

155
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:37,700
Not quite fast enough.

156
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,007
Come in.

157
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,887
-Hi.
-Can l help you?

158
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:50,819
l'm William Lansing.
l'm staying at the Royal Hotel.

159
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,892
l received a letter from you
about lrena Morawska.

160
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:57,896
l'm sorry, Mr. Lansing.
l wasn't expecting--

161
00:15:58,065 --> 00:16:00,761
l mean, lrena said you worked
outside with animals.

162
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:02,458
Did she say that?

163
00:16:02,636 --> 00:16:04,695
Would you go with me
for a moment?

164
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:06,362
Sure.

165
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,775
This is where she would sleep.

166
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,941
lt was all such a terrible business.

167
00:16:16,116 --> 00:16:18,516
lrena running away, l mean.

168
00:16:18,685 --> 00:16:21,153
Of course, l called the police, but....

169
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:25,550
-lrena ran away, huh?
-Perhaps there was a boy.

170
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:27,193
She was at that age.

171
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:29,522
And lrena was special.

172
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:33,029
She was special,
but l don't think there was a boy.

173
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:42,032
Napoleon.

174
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,268
You don't mind if l call the police?

175
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:45,672
Of course.

176
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:50,647
But would your colleagues expect
you to return home shortly?

177
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:52,409
Thank you, ma'am.

178
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:58,791
Hello. Yes.

179
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,290
We have a problem.

180
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:03,263
A man asking questions.

181
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,261
Says he's calling the police.

182
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:08,162
I told you, any more trouble,
I want out.

183
00:17:18,478 --> 00:17:20,469
You going somewhere?

184
00:17:20,647 --> 00:17:22,239
Sit down.

185
00:17:32,526 --> 00:17:33,925
l told him nothing.

186
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,063
This Mr. Lansing...

187
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:41,098
...did he say anything
out of the ordinary?

188
00:17:48,742 --> 00:17:49,970
''Napoleon.''

189
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,778
Napoleon?

190
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,419
A soldier. An emperor.

191
00:18:04,758 --> 00:18:07,659
But still, to some...

192
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:10,288
...just a little corporal.

193
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:13,063
Pretty, isn't it?

194
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:14,700
But like any rose...

195
00:18:14,868 --> 00:18:18,065
...the company must cut its thorns.

196
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:24,276
I have no pen to write with.
No paper.

197
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:27,607
And something is very wrong
with the men who have taken me.

198
00:18:27,781 --> 00:18:29,544
I'll try to leave you a message.

199
00:18:29,716 --> 00:18:31,274
Don't give up on me.

200
00:18:31,451 --> 00:18:32,975
I'll never give up on you.

201
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,279
Pan Pomieniawski, please.

202
00:19:10,624 --> 00:19:13,923
Hello, l have an emergency
missing-person situation.

203
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:16,858
Would you be able
to see me immediately?

204
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,832
My name is Williams.

205
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,865
Forty minutes? l can do that.

206
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,162
Thank you, dziekuje. Thank you.

207
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:10,077
Who sent you?

208
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:15,320
Look.

209
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:16,717
Up there.

210
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,448
Who sent you?

211
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,056
Wrong answer.

212
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,750
Yes, Mrs. Donata, the head of
the orphanage, has been murdered.

213
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:51,015
That's all the information
we've got so far.

214
00:21:07,174 --> 00:21:08,801
How you doing, young man?

215
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:13,173
Try these on.

216
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,017
Now, that's what l'm talking about.
See, where l come from...

217
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:22,621
...we would say you look cool.

218
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:24,188
l like that.

219
00:21:24,357 --> 00:21:25,824
That's right.

220
00:21:29,696 --> 00:21:31,061
Listen...

221
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:34,564
...l'm gonna write down
my phone number and where l am.

222
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:37,597
lf you need me...

223
00:21:38,305 --> 00:21:39,829
...call me.

224
00:21:40,006 --> 00:21:42,566
That's where l am. You hear?

225
00:21:42,742 --> 00:21:44,607
Can l help you, sir?

226
00:21:45,712 --> 00:21:49,113
Yeah, l was looking for the director.

227
00:21:49,282 --> 00:21:51,842
l am Detective Lato.
Was she expecting you?

228
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:53,349
Not really.

229
00:21:54,888 --> 00:21:56,583
Let's talk outside.

230
00:21:57,657 --> 00:21:59,852
Mrs. Donata was brutally murdered.

231
00:22:00,026 --> 00:22:03,154
Hours later, l find a mysterious
stranger on her doorstep...

232
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,558
...asking questions.

233
00:22:04,731 --> 00:22:06,130
Who are you?

234
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,132
l'm Bill Hale.
l'm with the Global Relief Fund.

235
00:22:09,302 --> 00:22:11,293
How well did you know
Mrs. Donata?

236
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:15,134
l didn't know her very well at all.
l just kind of met her in passing.

237
00:22:15,308 --> 00:22:17,833
You don't look like
a typical outreach volunteer.

238
00:22:18,011 --> 00:22:20,275
How long have you been
in Warsaw, Mr. Hale?

239
00:22:20,447 --> 00:22:23,041
You know what? l gotta
send my boss an e-mail.

240
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,581
-l gotta go.
-Okay.

241
00:22:24,751 --> 00:22:26,548
Send your e-mail
from our office...

242
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,883
...as we have a few more
minor questions for you.

243
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:31,784
You're late, Faisal.

244
00:22:32,926 --> 00:22:34,291
l'm here, Mr. Elgin.

245
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:35,826
What is the problem?

246
00:22:37,297 --> 00:22:39,731
A multimillion-dollar business.

247
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,493
An empire...

248
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:46,002
...now more profitable
than narcotics trafficking.

249
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:51,901
lt's like a giant hand with fingers
that stretch out across the globe.

250
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:55,575
''Human trafficking''
always seemed...

251
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,877
...like such an uninspired phrase.

252
00:22:59,052 --> 00:23:03,045
Still, it's extraordinary what you hear
on the BBC World Service these days.

253
00:23:03,223 --> 00:23:04,349
You know...

254
00:23:04,524 --> 00:23:07,925
...l heard about a woman
who was murdered in an orphanage.

255
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,091
l was only attending
to matters personally.

256
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,699
Well, your personal touch...

257
00:23:14,868 --> 00:23:16,768
...is turning into
cause for concern.

258
00:23:17,704 --> 00:23:20,502
l've always proven reliable
in the past, haven't l?

259
00:23:20,674 --> 00:23:23,040
There can be no further exposure.

260
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:26,144
And l don't want
to discuss this ever again.

261
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:28,637
Just think of it like chess.

262
00:23:29,816 --> 00:23:31,841
lf you don't protect your king...

263
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:35,087
...you're on the road to ruin.

264
00:23:36,189 --> 00:23:37,656
l apologize.

265
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:48,731
-There's a call for you.
-Please take a seat, Mr. Hale.

266
00:23:48,902 --> 00:23:50,233
l'll be right back.

267
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:26,468
lrena Morawska.

268
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:44,455
''United Alliance of Nations.''

269
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:51,425
We called the Global Relief Fund.

270
00:24:51,598 --> 00:24:54,123
Your story seemed to check out.

271
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,202
Just write down your contact
information, and you are free to go.

272
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:14,542
You're losing your touch, lbo.
Getting fat and sloppy.

273
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:24,128
l'm not sure l like
this new work, colonel.

274
00:25:24,297 --> 00:25:25,730
Pain is your friend, lbo.

275
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,298
Learn to love pain...

276
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:29,059
...and it'll set you free.

277
00:25:31,304 --> 00:25:32,828
l understand.

278
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,634
Good.

279
00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:48,151
Azimi, over here
and tell me something good.

280
00:25:48,321 --> 00:25:49,618
The American?

281
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:52,656
l check governmental sources,
nongovernmental sources.

282
00:25:52,826 --> 00:25:54,123
He doesn't exist.

283
00:25:54,294 --> 00:25:57,320
-Then why are all your friends dead?
-They very good men.

284
00:25:57,497 --> 00:25:59,397
And the codes in the letters?

285
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:03,866
l want this entire operation
moved swiftly, Azimi.

286
00:26:20,987 --> 00:26:23,353
You're a very clever girl.

287
00:26:23,523 --> 00:26:26,686
I can see why William
is so fond of you...

288
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,318
...and even more
why I can't let you go.

289
00:26:30,497 --> 00:26:35,161
It's time to devise a killer plan
for your Mr. Lansing.

290
00:26:57,323 --> 00:26:58,654
Digital videotape.

291
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,520
Let's get it to the lab.

292
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,360
You said it was urgent.

293
00:27:07,534 --> 00:27:09,263
l found this.

294
00:27:11,738 --> 00:27:14,434
-lt's your handwriting.
-That it is.

295
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:21,945
We found your letter on the girl.

296
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:19,836
There is also this.

297
00:28:53,006 --> 00:28:55,873
l read your letter, Mr. Lansing.

298
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,840
You knew how to pass as a volunteer
for the Global Relief Fund.

299
00:29:03,016 --> 00:29:05,644
You knew about the message
on the mirror walls.

300
00:29:06,986 --> 00:29:08,419
l'm an amateur.

301
00:29:08,588 --> 00:29:10,385
Just a little bit of guesswork.

302
00:29:10,556 --> 00:29:13,389
l don't believe you came
all this way on guesswork.

303
00:29:14,427 --> 00:29:16,019
You obviously have a past.

304
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:19,755
Sounds to me like you're the one
doing the guesswork now.

305
00:29:22,235 --> 00:29:25,864
Look, every year, thousands
of children go missing.

306
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:29,531
We have a serious problem
of human trafficking here.

307
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:33,478
With the evidence l have...

308
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,910
...l could hold you
on suspicion of murder.

309
00:29:36,082 --> 00:29:39,813
And you are not leaving this town
until l find out what's going on.

310
00:29:43,089 --> 00:29:44,920
-Who are you?
-Like l said...

311
00:29:45,091 --> 00:29:48,322
...just an amateur shooting in the dark.
Thanks for the drink.

312
00:29:57,704 --> 00:30:00,400
United Alliance of Nations.

313
00:30:23,396 --> 00:30:25,557
lrena taught you that, didn't she?

314
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:29,799
-lrena?
-See, l taught lrena that.

315
00:30:29,969 --> 00:30:31,300
lt's a code.

316
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,534
Come on in here.

317
00:30:40,546 --> 00:30:42,707
Men came for lrena, didn't they?

318
00:30:44,016 --> 00:30:45,711
What'd they look like?

319
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:49,986
Gangsters.

320
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,289
Military.

321
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,250
And what'd they look like?

322
00:30:59,665 --> 00:31:01,895
You pickpocketed them, didn't you?

323
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,330
You know what this is?

324
00:31:04,036 --> 00:31:05,503
This is a Turkish flag.

325
00:31:06,806 --> 00:31:09,138
Yeah, we're getting somewhere.

326
00:31:11,944 --> 00:31:14,879
This is the
lrena Morawska case, right?

327
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:18,346
Detective Lato said that you
were having trouble with the tape?

328
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,720
See, now, this is a simple case
of signal vs. digital throughput.

329
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,577
You think this is funny?

330
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:25,648
You want to get drunk?

331
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:35,355
lt's like a big ring.

332
00:32:36,696 --> 00:32:39,096
-And what's this here?
-Embassies.

333
00:32:39,265 --> 00:32:42,598
-Diplomats.
-Embassies and diplomats?

334
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,237
Annoucheka.

335
00:32:50,776 --> 00:32:52,038
That's right.

336
00:32:52,211 --> 00:32:54,145
You saw who took the girls.

337
00:32:54,313 --> 00:32:58,181
Help me, Nikki, and l'll make sure
that this doesn't happen again.

338
00:33:25,511 --> 00:33:27,445
Why the long face, Weiss, huh?

339
00:33:30,683 --> 00:33:33,379
This is the best shipment we've had
in a long time.

340
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:36,852
Don't tell me you're getting soft
on me now, are you?

341
00:33:38,925 --> 00:33:40,859
That's it, follow me.

342
00:33:44,764 --> 00:33:45,992
Thank you.

343
00:33:48,367 --> 00:33:50,358
No, let her stay.

344
00:33:51,938 --> 00:33:54,270
-Hi.
-Hi.

345
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,673
Tell me, what move
would you make, huh?

346
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:02,770
You have the wrong pieces
protecting your king.

347
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,684
Check.

348
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,610
Smart move.

349
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:11,950
Very smart.

350
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,075
Good afternoon, madam.
l am Mr. DiMonroe.

351
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:39,843
l'm here with the lnternational
Education Fund.

352
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:42,146
Who should l see about donations?

353
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:46,280
l think you have to talk to Mr. Weiss
in Finance and Operations...

354
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,256
...but he's still out to lunch.

355
00:34:48,427 --> 00:34:51,157
Okay, well, l'll just wait over here.
Thank you.

356
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:19,619
Any messages for me?

357
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:23,250
The man from the American Education
Fund asking about donations.

358
00:35:23,429 --> 00:35:25,226
l told him to wait.

359
00:35:39,078 --> 00:35:41,945
Mr. Weiss, l have been waiting here
for a half an hour.

360
00:35:42,114 --> 00:35:44,173
You know, they say time is money...

361
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,410
...and l've been known to make
some very large donations.

362
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:50,680
But it's a little thing
called respect, you know.

363
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:57,020
You should bring that American in.

364
00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:59,264
l don't think he did it.

365
00:35:59,432 --> 00:36:01,593
Do you have anything new?

366
00:36:01,801 --> 00:36:07,933
The girl. She came from a UAN
school, like all the other missing girls.

367
00:36:17,783 --> 00:36:21,184
My friend Annoucheka.
l heard her screaming.

368
00:36:21,353 --> 00:36:24,584
As long as you do as you are told,
you're all right, Lola.

369
00:36:24,757 --> 00:36:26,247
My name is lrena.

370
00:36:26,425 --> 00:36:29,258
Sure it is. Eat your food.

371
00:37:03,462 --> 00:37:05,987
Missing-people department, please.

372
00:37:52,745 --> 00:37:54,906
This is Weiss. All tapes delivered.

373
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,675
International online bidding
will commence now.

374
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,427
''Max-Com lnternet.''

375
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:27,040
Washington paid 75,000.

376
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,648
London bids 200,000.

377
00:38:53,038 --> 00:38:56,496
l trust my men won't have any problem
at the embassy ball.

378
00:38:56,675 --> 00:38:58,700
lt's not a problem.

379
00:39:03,148 --> 00:39:06,049
Mr. Lansing seems to have ignored
our message.

380
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,847
But if he thinks the girl is dead,
then he is not a problem.

381
00:39:10,022 --> 00:39:13,924
Some homicide detective phoned
Weiss asking about school records.

382
00:39:14,093 --> 00:39:17,722
-Weiss sent out the shipment of tapes.
-Time to ship him out.

383
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:26,635
Missing children.
You've not heard anything?

384
00:39:27,606 --> 00:39:29,733
You don't want this case, Kasia.

385
00:39:30,042 --> 00:39:33,842
And if your father was alive,
he'd tell you the same thing.

386
00:39:34,813 --> 00:39:36,644
l thought l'd find you guys here.

387
00:39:40,486 --> 00:39:44,752
Kasia, be smart. Stay out of trouble.

388
00:39:47,026 --> 00:39:51,588
You know, maybe you shouldn't be
drinking with folks like that.

389
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,755
Maybe l shouldn't be drinking
with you.

390
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,859
Besides...

391
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,901
...he's my uncle.

392
00:40:00,072 --> 00:40:01,664
Did l offend you?

393
00:40:07,513 --> 00:40:11,005
So to what do l owe this visit?

394
00:40:11,183 --> 00:40:14,710
lf there was an illegal lnternet service
in Warsaw...

395
00:40:14,887 --> 00:40:18,288
-...who would l talk to about it?
-Maybe you should ask my uncle.

396
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:22,188
Look, you want real information,
you tell me something good.

397
00:40:22,361 --> 00:40:27,731
Okay. The girl from the warehouse,
her name was Annoucheka Ravinska.

398
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,562
-l already know that.
-Okay.

399
00:40:30,736 --> 00:40:34,502
-There's a man called Weiss.
-From the UAN. l know that too.

400
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,408
He has information for me
back at his house.

401
00:40:37,576 --> 00:40:40,170
Aside from the joking,
these people are serious...

402
00:40:40,346 --> 00:40:44,146
-...and they don't care who they kill.
-l can take care of myself.

403
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:47,285
Can l ask you a question?
How much have you had to drink?

404
00:40:48,754 --> 00:40:51,382
Why don't l be
your designated driver.

405
00:40:51,557 --> 00:40:54,617
Give me the keys.
l'll take you where you want to go.

406
00:40:55,894 --> 00:40:57,327
Okay.

407
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:25,783
Oh, man. You're gonna be all right.

408
00:42:25,951 --> 00:42:28,010
Just lie down. Relax.

409
00:42:39,131 --> 00:42:42,032
You have to drink and get rid
of some of this pain.

410
00:42:43,335 --> 00:42:45,428
Little bit more.

411
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,596
lt will take away the pain.

412
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,002
Lie down.

413
00:42:57,216 --> 00:43:00,515
You're gonna be all right.
Just stay with me.

414
00:43:07,493 --> 00:43:10,053
l'm gonna cauterize this
to stop the bleeding.

415
00:43:10,262 --> 00:43:14,164
Come on. Wake up. Stay with me.
Lie down. Relax.

416
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:16,233
We're done.

417
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:21,330
lt's over.

418
00:43:21,507 --> 00:43:23,168
You did good.

419
00:43:23,342 --> 00:43:25,173
You did good.

420
00:43:29,114 --> 00:43:32,049
-Did you get the mail?
-Where's the letter from Max-Com?

421
00:43:32,217 --> 00:43:34,481
It was delivered.
It should be on the shelf.

422
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,883
Then somebody's been in here.

423
00:43:38,724 --> 00:43:40,555
ls it done?

424
00:43:40,893 --> 00:43:43,157
Weiss and his mistress, yes.

425
00:43:43,328 --> 00:43:46,263
What about the female homicide
detective? Was she there?

426
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:48,695
Yes, but we have a slight problem.

427
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,594
The American was there.

428
00:43:53,906 --> 00:43:55,498
Let's see...

429
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,471
...if you can do something right.

430
00:44:00,245 --> 00:44:01,473
Shoot me.

431
00:44:09,288 --> 00:44:10,846
Do it!

432
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:18,724
You know what the problem
with my father was?

433
00:44:19,731 --> 00:44:22,427
He wasn't hard enough on me.

434
00:44:41,153 --> 00:44:43,917
Don't worry, l closed my eyes
during the procedure.

435
00:44:45,791 --> 00:44:47,190
Where did you learn this?

436
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,418
l've been around a couple of places.

437
00:44:49,962 --> 00:44:52,089
You were in the military, weren't you?

438
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,693
Please don't move.

439
00:45:00,105 --> 00:45:02,972
The people who killed Weiss
are going to look for us...

440
00:45:03,141 --> 00:45:05,109
...so we have to be very careful.

441
00:45:06,111 --> 00:45:08,375
Who's behind all of this?

442
00:45:08,547 --> 00:45:12,916
l think they're people with diplomatic
connections. Possibly Turkish.

443
00:45:15,053 --> 00:45:17,385
Whatever you do,
don't call your colleagues.

444
00:45:17,556 --> 00:45:20,024
lt will only endanger their lives.

445
00:45:22,294 --> 00:45:26,458
l made a mistake once. l'm not gonna
make the same mistake again.

446
00:45:35,674 --> 00:45:36,902
Good morning, colonel.

447
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:41,204
Your message seemed rather vague.

448
00:45:42,214 --> 00:45:44,876
Like l said, l'm a stranger
going to the West.

449
00:45:45,317 --> 00:45:46,841
Where are you from?

450
00:45:47,019 --> 00:45:49,317
What if l said l was from the East?

451
00:45:52,224 --> 00:45:54,158
What do you want, friend?

452
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,696
l think we both know
where this comes from, colonel.

453
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:01,156
l don't understand.

454
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:05,793
l hear you're looking for a man
who writes letters.

455
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:08,963
And why is this
of any interest to you?

456
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:14,069
Let's just say l could help you
put a face to the name.

457
00:46:15,681 --> 00:46:18,445
l'll have somebody contact you.

458
00:46:18,617 --> 00:46:20,482
Your business isn't my concern.

459
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,485
We need to put an old dog
out of his misery.

460
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:43,003
Find something interesting?

461
00:46:45,744 --> 00:46:48,269
ls this your home?

462
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,648
One of many.

463
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:53,278
Where's your real home?

464
00:46:53,452 --> 00:46:55,545
lt's everywhere.

465
00:46:57,222 --> 00:47:00,749
Tell me about
your new friend William.

466
00:47:01,393 --> 00:47:02,621
He's nice.

467
00:47:03,762 --> 00:47:04,990
Nice?

468
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,226
Nice?

469
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:12,402
ls that all?

470
00:47:22,013 --> 00:47:24,345
You're onto where the children
might be.

471
00:47:24,516 --> 00:47:27,542
Well, l'll tell you what,
l think this company, ltara...

472
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,416
...has got an online lnternet scam
selling people all over the world.

473
00:47:39,564 --> 00:47:41,327
lt fits.

474
00:47:42,434 --> 00:47:45,130
-What do you think?
-Good to go.

475
00:47:49,574 --> 00:47:52,042
Would you like to go to a party?

476
00:47:52,277 --> 00:47:53,972
An embassy ball.

477
00:47:54,146 --> 00:47:57,240
What would you be doing
at an embassy ball?

478
00:47:57,949 --> 00:48:00,747
Business, pleasure.

479
00:48:02,387 --> 00:48:05,220
Just like this game of chess.

480
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:08,951
Simply about the moves you make.

481
00:48:13,732 --> 00:48:14,960
Well?

482
00:48:21,673 --> 00:48:23,334
Check.

483
00:48:28,413 --> 00:48:29,971
Check.

484
00:48:34,686 --> 00:48:35,914
Mate.

485
00:48:39,758 --> 00:48:41,350
l want to go home now.

486
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,684
You are home, dear.

487
00:48:43,862 --> 00:48:45,557
My friend...

488
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,357
...William...

489
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:49,794
...he'll come.

490
00:48:50,435 --> 00:48:51,993
You'll see.

491
00:48:52,871 --> 00:48:55,032
l look forward to meeting him.

492
00:48:55,207 --> 00:48:58,199
The sooner the better.

493
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:05,914
ls that him?

494
00:50:11,349 --> 00:50:12,680
ls that the man?

495
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,317
Son, is that the man?

496
00:50:20,525 --> 00:50:22,220
Yes.

497
00:50:29,134 --> 00:50:32,797
What l need to do is get an invitation
to this embassy ball.

498
00:50:39,945 --> 00:50:41,435
l'm hungry.

499
00:50:41,613 --> 00:50:42,841
The caviar looks nice.

500
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:45,778
l'll bring you food
after l put you downstairs. Walk.

501
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:48,749
l think you're gonna drug my food,
and l won't eat it.

502
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,353
Your food won't be drugged.

503
00:50:50,522 --> 00:50:53,491
lf you don't let me eat
some of that caviar, l'll scream.

504
00:50:53,658 --> 00:50:55,387
No, you won't.

505
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,323
Let her eat.

506
00:51:11,343 --> 00:51:12,833
This...

507
00:51:14,879 --> 00:51:16,437
...is...

508
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:20,318
...a trap.

509
00:51:29,094 --> 00:51:30,721
You had enough.

510
00:51:39,804 --> 00:51:42,705
Make sure no one touches this.

511
00:51:43,742 --> 00:51:45,039
lt's been a while, my friend.

512
00:51:47,212 --> 00:51:50,113
Yes, it has. How are you?

513
00:51:51,016 --> 00:51:52,381
What can l do for you?

514
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:57,112
l was thinking, l wanted to get into
the Turkish embassy ball tonight.

515
00:51:57,288 --> 00:51:59,984
Thought maybe you could arrange
a special pass.

516
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,991
l'm not certain
that l can help you this time.

517
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:05,391
All right. Well, l'm sorry for asking.

518
00:52:05,563 --> 00:52:09,556
l'll just go to our old friends
in Moscow and do it like that.

519
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:15,769
Right, l want both of these stairwells
covered in case he tries to exit.

520
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:19,569
Hey. Gentlemen,
will you excuse me for a second?

521
00:52:20,578 --> 00:52:23,046
There's somebody
who wants to see you, sir.

522
00:52:23,214 --> 00:52:26,547
He says that your friend
who was traveling West sent him.

523
00:52:26,718 --> 00:52:28,117
Traveling West?

524
00:52:28,286 --> 00:52:31,983
Yes. lbo, take over for me.

525
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,419
Where are you going so dressed up?

526
00:52:37,595 --> 00:52:39,620
Got a rental car in the parking lot.

527
00:52:40,565 --> 00:52:42,396
Here's the keys.

528
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:44,228
Cash in the glove box.

529
00:52:44,602 --> 00:52:48,129
lf you leave now, you could hit
the Czech border by nightfall.

530
00:52:48,606 --> 00:52:49,834
How about you?

531
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:54,301
l'd like you to keep going.
Don't stop for anyone. Not even to eat.

532
00:52:54,746 --> 00:52:57,180
When you get to the Capital Hotel,
call me.

533
00:52:57,348 --> 00:52:59,873
-You're leaving us, aren't you?
-Not exactly.

534
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:03,077
l just think this could get
a little bit dangerous...

535
00:53:03,254 --> 00:53:06,314
-...and l don't want you around.
-You said we were friends.

536
00:53:06,491 --> 00:53:08,891
Yeah, we are friends.
Nothing to do with that.

537
00:53:12,263 --> 00:53:14,163
Come here, give me a hug.

538
00:53:17,669 --> 00:53:19,603
All right.

539
00:53:21,106 --> 00:53:24,007
-Take care of her.
-You gonna give her a hug?

540
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:36,977
Be safe, guys.

541
00:53:37,522 --> 00:53:39,285
Be careful.

542
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,311
Why didn't they invite you
to the party upstairs?

543
00:54:10,488 --> 00:54:13,048
Stop trying to get inside my head.

544
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,493
l should be upstairs on point,
not down here playing babysitter.

545
00:54:18,663 --> 00:54:21,427
Besides, l'm the only one
who can identify this guy.

546
00:54:24,569 --> 00:54:26,628
That's why you're here.

547
00:54:34,746 --> 00:54:35,974
Now...

548
00:54:36,781 --> 00:54:41,480
...if anyone comes through that door,
you know what to do, right?

549
00:55:19,123 --> 00:55:22,650
-How are you? Nice to see you.
-How are you? Very nice to see you.

550
00:55:57,795 --> 00:56:01,822
Either put that thing out
or open the door.

551
00:56:19,517 --> 00:56:21,610
Hello, Mr. Morak.

552
00:56:22,287 --> 00:56:24,414
My friend from Russia,
Nikolai Verchinko.

553
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:26,989
-Nice to meet you.
-A businessman.

554
00:56:31,095 --> 00:56:35,088
-l would love to, very much.
-My old friend Nikolai Verchinko.

555
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,824
Friend from Russia.

556
00:56:46,678 --> 00:56:49,408
-Faisal.
-Always a pleasure, Vasily.

557
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,047
How are you?

558
00:56:51,215 --> 00:56:53,513
-Who's this?
-l'm Nikolai Verchinko.

559
00:56:53,985 --> 00:56:56,351
-lt's nice to meet you.
-A firm grip there...

560
00:56:56,521 --> 00:56:58,989
...and your name is indeed familiar.

561
00:56:59,157 --> 00:57:03,218
No, no. Bring the special caviar
for our Russian guest.

562
00:57:03,928 --> 00:57:07,159
So maybe we'll speak again
in a more intimate setting.

563
00:57:07,332 --> 00:57:08,594
-Perhaps.
-Yeah.

564
00:57:08,766 --> 00:57:09,994
Some food?

565
00:57:41,899 --> 00:57:43,298
Compliments of Mr. Faisal.

566
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,800
An elegant arrangement.

567
00:57:47,271 --> 00:57:49,899
My compliments to the chef.

568
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:55,036
This is a trap.

569
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,241
You should try some.

570
00:57:58,082 --> 00:57:59,913
She's here.

571
00:58:11,429 --> 00:58:12,794
Hey.

572
00:58:13,097 --> 00:58:15,361
Your friend Nikolai...

573
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,330
...where is he?

574
00:58:19,203 --> 00:58:21,398
Where'd he go, Vasily?

575
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,101
Sorry.

576
00:59:04,048 --> 00:59:06,312
-Now we've got him.
-Go.

577
00:59:07,819 --> 00:59:09,252
Excuse me.

578
00:59:13,658 --> 00:59:15,785
You're not going anywhere--

579
00:59:24,335 --> 00:59:25,927
Don't worry.

580
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,163
Hang in there, kid.

581
01:00:00,905 --> 01:00:03,135
-ls it warm?
-As usual.

582
01:00:27,732 --> 01:00:29,256
Good evening.

583
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,165
May l help you?

584
01:00:31,335 --> 01:00:35,271
Well, l've been told that you have
a rather spectacular establishment...

585
01:00:35,439 --> 01:00:39,068
...and l was wondering
if you could show me around.

586
01:00:40,211 --> 01:00:44,170
The structure itself dates back
to the time of King Stanislav.

587
01:00:44,348 --> 01:00:45,337
Really?

588
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:48,644
He was the lover
of Catherine the Great.

589
01:00:48,886 --> 01:00:51,719
They used to meet here in secret.

590
01:00:51,889 --> 01:00:57,259
The walls have hidden passages for
those who may need a discreet exit.

591
01:00:57,995 --> 01:01:01,158
We pride ourselves on discretion.

592
01:01:02,266 --> 01:01:04,393
lt's a beautiful room.

593
01:01:04,602 --> 01:01:07,366
Listen, you know the young lady
that l saw earlier...

594
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,529
...with the hair combed
straight back?

595
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:12,301
Do you think l could spend
some time with her?

596
01:01:12,476 --> 01:01:14,341
Smart choice.

597
01:01:14,979 --> 01:01:18,244
-l'll send her in.
-Thank you so much.

598
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:47,744
-You speak English?
-Yes.

599
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:50,904
-Where are you from?
-l'm from Turkey.

600
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,383
Listen.

601
01:01:53,551 --> 01:01:56,418
l know that you're used to one thing
or another...

602
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:58,646
...but we'll do something different.

603
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,435
He's probably checked
out of the hotel.

604
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:21,442
l wouldn't even know
where to look for him.

605
01:02:29,553 --> 01:02:31,043
Okay.

606
01:02:40,431 --> 01:02:42,092
-Coffee, sir?
-Thank you.

607
01:02:42,266 --> 01:02:43,528
Who's that lady?

608
01:02:44,235 --> 01:02:45,862
She is a lady of the night.

609
01:02:46,537 --> 01:02:48,869
-Do you know her?
-Yes.

610
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,735
Be my guest.

611
01:03:20,638 --> 01:03:22,697
Sorry about your head.
l didn't mean to do that.

612
01:03:22,873 --> 01:03:24,841
l just need five minutes
of your time.

613
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:27,170
lf l'm not back soon,
they'll look for me.

614
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:31,008
l'll get to the point. This is a simple
exchange of information.

615
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,013
Tell me what l need to know...

616
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:36,517
...and then l need you to tell Faisal
what l want him to think.

617
01:03:36,687 --> 01:03:37,949
What do you want?

618
01:03:38,122 --> 01:03:41,649
l'm gonna give you $ 10,000 cash.

619
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:43,785
Why should l trust you?

620
01:03:43,961 --> 01:03:46,486
You don't really have
much of a choice.

621
01:03:46,797 --> 01:03:48,765
Then after you've done
what l asked...

622
01:03:48,933 --> 01:03:52,892
...l'll give you another 10,000, cash,
just because l like you so much.

623
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:56,437
-You said five minutes of my time?
-That's about all it'll take.

624
01:03:58,576 --> 01:03:59,941
Okay. What do you need?

625
01:04:00,478 --> 01:04:03,379
ls this the Oasis Hotel?
This is Dr. Graham.

626
01:04:03,547 --> 01:04:06,448
Have my wife and son
checked out yet?

627
01:04:07,985 --> 01:04:10,215
A message?

628
01:04:22,566 --> 01:04:24,932
lnside. Quickly.

629
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:33,135
What are you doing here? l told you
not to stop. l told you to keep going.

630
01:04:33,310 --> 01:04:35,904
He wouldn't let me leave you.

631
01:04:38,182 --> 01:04:42,050
-lt's not safe for you here.
-lt's not safe out there either.

632
01:04:42,219 --> 01:04:44,346
You're gonna need
some real firepower...

633
01:04:44,522 --> 01:04:47,116
...and l know where to get it.

634
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:53,321
-Who's gonna look after the boy?
-l can look after him.

635
01:04:54,598 --> 01:04:56,862
We won't be gone long.

636
01:04:57,501 --> 01:04:59,628
Are you gonna be all right?

637
01:05:11,081 --> 01:05:14,141
-As soon as the car leaves--
-l know what to do. Good luck.

638
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:16,115
Thank you.

639
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:20,390
Be safe.

640
01:05:32,102 --> 01:05:34,468
What happened to you?

641
01:05:35,573 --> 01:05:37,200
The American.

642
01:05:37,374 --> 01:05:40,366
-He sent a hooker to lure me away.
-You see him?

643
01:05:40,678 --> 01:05:45,479
l know where he is, or should l say,
where he is gonna be.

644
01:05:45,883 --> 01:05:47,612
How?

645
01:05:47,785 --> 01:05:52,813
l beat it out the filthy bitch.
She fought back, but....

646
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:56,391
The restaurant owner
verifies your man's story.

647
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:59,051
We should at least
check the place out, colonel.

648
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:02,028
Well, if this is all true, lbo...

649
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:06,158
...tell me, why do you look so guilty?

650
01:06:06,871 --> 01:06:12,036
l didn't mean to hit her
so hard, but....

651
01:06:14,712 --> 01:06:16,737
You killed her?

652
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:22,111
l'm impressed, lbo.

653
01:06:23,687 --> 01:06:26,622
Now she can't tell the American
that we're onto him.

654
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:32,020
How many men can you give me?

655
01:06:32,796 --> 01:06:36,095
Five should be enough.
Take care of it, Azimi.

656
01:06:38,769 --> 01:06:41,397
l'd like to get cleaned up, colonel.

657
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:45,808
Be quick.

658
01:06:52,449 --> 01:06:54,815
You got what l asked for?

659
01:06:54,985 --> 01:06:58,751
Excellent. Benelli Super 90.
Exactly what the doctor ordered.

660
01:06:59,189 --> 01:07:01,589
You're gonna be all right?

661
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:20,107
So, what's the plan?

662
01:07:20,277 --> 01:07:24,213
lbo says that lrena will probably be
in Faisal's room all the time.

663
01:07:24,381 --> 01:07:26,474
-His room?
-l know how that sounds.

664
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:29,016
We're just gonna have to hope
for the best.

665
01:07:29,186 --> 01:07:31,711
Any reason you chose
a place like this?

666
01:07:31,889 --> 01:07:36,917
This is a nice place, and there
is a method to my madness.

667
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:40,928
And this is a part of my method.
This is a secret passageway...

668
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:43,828
...courtesy of King Stanislav.

669
01:07:50,374 --> 01:07:52,672
Were you ever married, William?

670
01:07:52,843 --> 01:07:56,040
Oh, you're forever the detective,
aren't you?

671
01:07:57,982 --> 01:08:00,280
You still haven't told me why.

672
01:08:00,985 --> 01:08:04,284
Why all of this for a girl
you've never even met?

673
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:07,447
You know, some of us have done
bad things in the past.

674
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,991
And once in a while,
we find something...

675
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,687
...that makes us feel better
about ourselves.

676
01:08:13,864 --> 01:08:16,662
This little girl means a lot to me.

677
01:08:42,726 --> 01:08:44,694
Take them out.

678
01:08:45,562 --> 01:08:47,826
Good evening. May l help you?

679
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:50,398
The American. Where's he at?

680
01:08:52,569 --> 01:08:54,867
The door at the end.
The Japanese room.

681
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:58,236
-Anybody else down there?
-No.

682
01:08:58,409 --> 01:09:02,402
Okay. Out. Now.

683
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:12,647
Shit.

684
01:11:35,599 --> 01:11:38,591
-You okay?
-Yes, l'm fine.

685
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:44,265
Sounds like your friend's down,
Billy Ray.

686
01:11:45,442 --> 01:11:47,103
lt's down to the wire, Billy.

687
01:11:47,444 --> 01:11:51,107
Like the old saying goes,
good guys finish last.

688
01:11:52,216 --> 01:11:54,582
You've gone soft.

689
01:11:54,751 --> 01:11:58,414
Look where that got you tonight.
Huh, Billy Ray?

690
01:11:58,589 --> 01:12:01,183
Lewis, you're playing
a whore's game.

691
01:12:02,426 --> 01:12:04,053
You ain't nothing but a whore.

692
01:12:04,228 --> 01:12:06,355
And you know
what happens to whores.

693
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:09,522
-What?
-Whores always get fucked, don't they?

694
01:12:10,133 --> 01:12:12,363
You gonna fuck me, huh?

695
01:12:15,906 --> 01:12:17,931
Hey, Billy...

696
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:22,436
-...l'm out.
-Ain't that a coincidence? l'm out too.

697
01:12:24,514 --> 01:12:26,175
You see?

698
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:29,786
So how do you want to play this?

699
01:12:29,953 --> 01:12:31,978
Hey, Billy, it's your call, man.

700
01:12:32,155 --> 01:12:36,057
Look, just like old times.
Just me and you.

701
01:12:38,028 --> 01:12:41,464
-Hey, l was just kidding.
-l was just kidding too.

702
01:12:52,109 --> 01:12:53,906
You okay?

703
01:12:55,112 --> 01:12:57,444
-Go get the girl.
-You sure?

704
01:12:58,548 --> 01:13:00,482
Yeah.

705
01:13:09,459 --> 01:13:11,552
Stand up.

706
01:13:12,629 --> 01:13:14,597
Get up!

707
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:22,804
We're gonna take
a little journey together.

708
01:13:38,822 --> 01:13:40,517
lt's my favorite moment in life.

709
01:13:40,691 --> 01:13:43,785
-What's that?
-When the predator becomes the prey.

710
01:13:44,261 --> 01:13:47,958
Also my favorite moment,
but it remains to be seen...

711
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:51,665
...who's the predator
and who's the prey.

712
01:13:59,076 --> 01:14:01,408
lt's okay. Don't be afraid.

713
01:14:01,578 --> 01:14:04,206
-Who are you?
-You knew l'd come for you.

714
01:14:05,148 --> 01:14:09,676
You know, with these guns, l can't
really kill you slowly, and l'd like to.

715
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:13,011
-What? ln front of the child?
-Exactly.

716
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:16,159
So why don't we settle this like men,
outside, without the guns?

717
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:18,325
Sure.

718
01:14:19,463 --> 01:14:21,328
This won't take long.

719
01:14:21,865 --> 01:14:24,265
You're right about that.

720
01:14:24,434 --> 01:14:26,994
l despise taking human life.

721
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:30,071
l'm kind of embarrassed
to admit the fact...

722
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:33,334
...that l'm gonna enjoy
killing you slowly.

723
01:14:36,913 --> 01:14:39,905
My sentiments exactly.

724
01:19:23,633 --> 01:19:28,969
Dear Kasia, Nikki and I are
finally safe and well in America.

725
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:33,906
William sends his regards and thanks.
William doesn't say very much.

726
01:19:34,077 --> 01:19:36,978
As you know, he's not one for words.

727
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:39,445
He spends most of his time
by himself...

728
01:19:39,616 --> 01:19:42,449
...wandering the forest
looking for injured animals.

729
01:19:42,619 --> 01:19:44,610
He seems to like it that way.

730
01:19:44,788 --> 01:19:47,814
At least now, though,
he'll never be alone.

731
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:51,722
All our love, Irena and Nikki.

732
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:13,445
-Where do you think he's flying?
-Maybe he has a family too.
