1
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,500
11:55.
I'll be right out front.

2
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,700
- You all right?
- Get that out of my face.

3
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,200
I don't believe this.

4
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,200
- This is next door.
- I know we're next door.

5
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,400
Jesus Christ.

6
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Jesus.

7
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,800
I don't believe this.

8
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,700
Shit.

9
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,700
What are you doing?
Come on. Let's get out of here.

10
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,800
I'm coming.

11
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,200
Jerry, come on! Come on!

12
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Can you believe this shit?

13
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,300
What kind of asshole
robs a bakery?

14
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,100
I don't see him.
What are we going to do?

15
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,200
It's been five minutes.
Let's just get out of here.

16
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,600
Come on, I mean...

17
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,000
Just get outta here!
Come on! Move it!

18
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,500
Jesus Christ.
We waited long enough.

19
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,000
Come on! Start the car!

20
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,500
What do you got?

21
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,400
Well, they cleaned out
the register.

22
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,700
Big time.

23
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,900
The place ain't bad...
the brownies.

24
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,400
Come on. Let's go write it up.

25
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,800
You research something,
you do it right, that's all.

26
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,500
You think maybe we should
circle back for him?

27
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,900
You set up a jewelry store,
then you rob a jewelry store.

28
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,300
You don't rob a fuckin' bakery.

29
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,200
Think he made it?

30
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,100
He gets out of things,
you know?

31
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:32,000
You take the car, OK?
You drop me off.

32
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,500
If I don't get a message,
I'll come over later.

33
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,100
A fuckin' bakery.
I mean, who the fuck can we be?

34
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,800
Russ.

35
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,300
Are you alone?

36
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,600
Just me and Walter,
but I'm expecting somebody.

37
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
I was on my way home anyway.

38
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,000
Where you been?

39
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,300
Get in here.

40
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,700
Can I use the sink?

41
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,000
What's up, Walt?

42
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,600
How's it going?

43
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,600
Back to work?

44
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,800
You breaking hearts?

45
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,500
I figure I'll put something
together, you know?

46
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,400
Make a little money,
get a few bucks together...

47
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,000
make a plan, and stretch out.

48
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,900
You'll do it.

49
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,100
- Think so?
- Believe me.

50
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,600
Drink's on me.

51
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,300
You sure?

52
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,500
- Come on.
- Come on.

53
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,700
All right.

54
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,600
How you doing?

55
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,900
No complaints.
Busy night out there?

56
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:49,400
Some jerks
tried to take a bakery.

57
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,700
Can you believe that?

58
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Excuse me.
I forgot my ciggies.

59
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,000
Hey, Ed.

60
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,300
You know each other?

61
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,700
I never saw him before
in my life, right, Ed?

62
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,400
I'll see you guys later.

63
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,600
l, uh, can't stay.

64
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,000
Sorry. I'll take a rain check.

65
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,300
What's that shit
all over your clothes, asshole?

66
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,200
Why don't you tell me, Ed?

67
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,600
Why don't you give me
a ride home, Eddie?

68
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,600
I ran out of gas.

69
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,100
He's been coughing all night.

70
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,600
I turned on the humidifier.

71
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,700
Man, what time is it?

72
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,000
Ohh, boy.

73
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,400
I got something for you.

74
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,600
Unbutton my shirt.

75
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,500
Jerry, it's 2:30 in the morning.
Open your own damn shirt.

76
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,600
You're going to love this,
I swear to God. Please?

77
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,400
What? What?

78
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,100
Jerry, what are you doing
with a doughnut in your shirt?

79
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,800
Reach in. Come on. Reach in.

80
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,800
Where did you get them?

81
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,000
Bags of them all over the road.

82
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,800
Must have been a danish truck.

83
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
Mmm. I think it's cinnamon.

84
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,100
Yeah? You like that?

85
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,400
He's OK.

86
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,600
Eddie, I'm shocked.

87
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,400
You just be careful, all right?

88
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,200
I'd be smart if I were you.

89
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,900
Go on, wise ass.

90
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,000
What are you doing home?

91
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,700
I drove your brother back.

92
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:44,600
How gallant.
Where'd you find him?

93
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,300
Why does your mother keep
putting my doughnuts in here?

94
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,900
I can't stand cold doughnuts.

95
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
- Russell, is that you?
- Yeah.

96
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,900
Morning.

97
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,300
What are you...

98
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,200
Good morning.

99
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,600
All right. I'm coming.
I'm coming. Relax, will you?

100
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,200
Relax!

101
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,400
Great. Shit.

102
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,400
That's right.

103
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,000
Who's that?

104
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,900
You didn't come out
when I called you.

105
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,600
I got caught up.

106
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,400
Hey, Mike, some coffee, please.

107
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,200
- What?
- He hid behind a mixer.

108
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,400
What's so funny, Jerry?
What's so funny?

109
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,200
Our lives are on the line,
and you eat pastry.

110
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,300
You think that's funny?

111
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,200
By the way,
your brother-in-law showed up.

112
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,100
Hey, look, I'm in there, right?

113
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm all crouched down.

114
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There's cops all around me.
Everything is sticky.

115
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,500
I started thinking
about Betty and the kid.

116
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,700
I mean, what if I get caught?
What happens to them?

117
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,300
- It's nuts.
- Why did this happen?

118
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,400
Can we... can the three of us
analyze this for a moment here?

119
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,200
- It made a "L."
- What?

120
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,600
The bakery made an "L"
behind the jewelry store.

121
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,000
Who knew? Did you know?

122
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,600
I did not know. We didn't have
any way of knowing.

123
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,000
It's a total unknown.

124
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,600
Did you visit both places?

125
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Yeah, I inquired about
earrings and necklaces.

126
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,700
I didn't ask them
what went on in the back.

127
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,600
That's no excuse.
It was your assignment.

128
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,800
Are you in construction
or not, Jerry?

129
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,300
I didn't have the plans, did I?

130
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,600
The jewelry store is here,
the bakery is here.

131
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,200
And where did you think
they kept the overage...

132
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,800
on the fucking roof?

133
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,400
Look, we should just
forget theft completely...

134
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,200
just rule it out.
Concentrate on ideas.

135
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,400
I'm not talking about
a life of crime.

136
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,200
I'm talking about a momentary
shift in life styles...

137
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,500
a little, itty-bitty alteration.

138
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,600
You understand? You understand?

139
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,800
You're in a hurry,
you go on the highway...

140
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,800
every fucking car on the highway
is going eighty miles an hour.

141
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,200
What do you do, Jerry?
What do you do, Jerry?

142
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Do you drive fifty-five
because it's the law?

143
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,600
Of course not.
You go with the flow.

144
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,800
You drive
at the prevailing speed.

145
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,400
When you exit the highway,
then you revert.

146
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,500
What's this?

147
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,900
Forty-five dollars.
We got the cash register.

148
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,600
- Oh, we scored.
- Yeah, we scored.

149
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,200
There, big shot.
Go buy a doughnut.

150
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,000
I got to get back, OK?

151
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,400
No. They can wait.
Listen, l, uh...

152
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,200
You're not answering
my question.

153
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,000
The next time I need a ride
home, I'll let you know.

154
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I am not talking about tonight.

155
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm talking about
Thursday, Friday, the future.

156
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Now, you're doing a good job
since you got here, Betty...

157
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
and I just really want
to express my gratitude...

158
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,500
for the corporation.

159
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,600
Hey, a couple of drinks.

160
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,000
We're both married.

161
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,800
He's gonna freeze out there.

162
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,100
He's probably gonna
take the bus.

163
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,600
There are no buses.
They cut the route.

164
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,200
He's probably waiting
for a cab.

165
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,300
Hey, Jerry, wait.

166
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,800
How long ago did you call?

167
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,100
They get angry when
you're not there, real nasty.

168
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,700
You know,
you could die out there.

169
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,400
Old people die all the time
out in the cold.

170
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,300
It's called hypothermia.

171
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,000
What'd I say?

172
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,700
Fenders and doors, trunks...

173
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,800
I did it in 98's, 88's.

174
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,600
I wouldn't spray paint.

175
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,600
I drew the line at that...
no paint.

176
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,900
What's wrong with painting?
I painted for four years.

177
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,300
Gets on the lungs.

178
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,200
What about you? You painted?

179
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,800
No. I'm a, uh, carpenter.

180
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,900
Yeah, he's self-unemployed.

181
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,800
l... I got my social security
and the pension...

182
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,300
but it's not enough.

183
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,500
God bless your wife.

184
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,600
You ought to feed those dogs.

185
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,500
See you.

186
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,200
- Look, you're lucky.
- Oh, yeah?

187
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,900
Don't make me stand up, 'cause
I'll send you to the moon.

188
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,600
It's OK.

189
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,000
I better get going.

190
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,300
- No, no.
- No. I got to go.

191
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,000
- What is that about Broadway?
- What?

192
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Come on, you were saying
that we could eat out...

193
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,800
and maybe go see Cats,
something like that.

194
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,200
- I said that?
- Yeah.

195
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,400
- I said we could go out?
- Yeah.

196
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
- I hate Cats.
- No, you don't.

197
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,200
All right, all right, all right.

198
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,100
How about this... how about
we go down to the shore?

199
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,400
I'll say I'm going
with one of my girlfriends.

200
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,100
We're going to go
to the boardwalk? Come on.

201
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,200
No, for the weekend.

202
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,000
Come on, we can stay
at that place you said.

203
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,400
- What place?
- That casino.

204
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,200
- What casino?
- The one on TV.

205
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,000
- You want to do something?
- Yeah.

206
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,800
Huh? You really want
to do something?

207
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,400
- Yeah.
- I mean for real.

208
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,300
All right. How about
I take you to California?

209
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,600
California.

210
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,000
They have fresh-squeezed
orange juice every day.

211
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,300
Picture. If you have a backyard
there, you got fresh fruit.

212
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,100
Get our own little lime tree,
avocado tree.

213
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,900
- What do you say?
- Don't bullshit me, Russell.

214
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,600
Do I look like
I'm bullshitting you?

215
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,400
- Yes.
- Look at my face.

216
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,800
Does this look like
a bullshitting face?

217
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,000
Oh, she's home.

218
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,100
Laurie?

219
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,700
All right, all right.

220
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,200
Where were you?

221
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,100
Get your feet off my bed.

222
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,200
Your mother said you were here.

223
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,700
I was here.

224
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,900
I got this idea.
I think you're gonna love it.

225
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,300
You know
all those old people...

226
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,500
who wait in front
of the supermarket...

227
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,700
since they canceled the bus?

228
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,100
- Yeah.
- Now they got to take cabs.

229
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,000
So we start
our own car service.

230
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,400
We use Jerry's car.
It's an instant money-maker.

231
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,800
Why?

232
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,200
Why what?

233
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,100
Tell me why these people...

234
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,400
would want to use us
instead of taking a cab.

235
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,000
Why? Because those cab drivers
are subhuman scumbags.

236
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,800
And we're cheaper,
we're more reliable...

237
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,200
we're polite, we're humble.

238
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,200
You mean like
a private car service.

239
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,700
- Exactly.
- You need a license, Sid.

240
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,100
We know all those people
through Betty.

241
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,600
You don't need a license
to drop your friends off.

242
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,700
That would be like a chauffeur.

243
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,400
That's not my style. Forget it.

244
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,600
I'm invited for dinner.

245
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,000
What else is new?

246
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,600
- Wash your hands.
- We did, ma.

247
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,500
- What?
- I said we did, ma.

248
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
OK. Lower your voice.

249
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,300
- Wash your hands.
- I did.

250
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,100
Did you use soap?

251
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,600
To what do we owe this honor?

252
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,200
I was in the neighborhood.

253
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,000
I didn't hear any alarms
going off.

254
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
- He's always welcome.
- He's always here.

255
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,200
Don't start trouble.

256
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,900
- Who are you talkin' to?
- I'm talkin' to my sister.

257
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,200
- Watch how you do it.
- No, you watch me how I do it.

258
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,300
Maybe you'll learn something
for a change.

259
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,400
What are you laughin' at?

260
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Meatballs.

261
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,900
He's always welcome.

262
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,400
You come home from work,
you pick up my prescription.

263
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,800
It ain't open... the drugstore.

264
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,700
Someday, you'll get
a decent shift...

265
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,200
when human beings are awake.

266
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,800
I'm working on it.
It'll happen.

267
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,300
Maybe I can give you
a recommendation.

268
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,500
I'll do my best.

269
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,100
I got a recommendation
for you... shut up.

270
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,400
Don't get smart with me, Ed,
'cause I'll come over there...

271
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,800
and I'll choke you to death.

272
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,000
- Come on.
- Hey, listen to what he said.

273
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,400
Tough guy. Come on.

274
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,800
You look at the ads
this morning?

275
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,100
Yes, I did, ma,
and there's nothing there.

276
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,400
Not what they're looking for.

277
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,200
What is that supposed to mean?

278
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,500
Vice president, CEO...

279
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,000
Correct me if I'm wrong.

280
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,300
I think you ought to go into
the bakery business.

281
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,800
- The what?
- Bakery.

282
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,000
He never cooked in his life.

283
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,300
Why would you suggest that, Ed?

284
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,900
Just a thought.

285
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,600
Just a thought?
I just got a thought.

286
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Maybe you could tell us
who puts his hands...

287
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,800
in strange pies.
What do you say?

288
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,200
What's that supposed to mean?

289
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,700
Ask him. Maybe we could have
a little conversation...

290
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,400
about that.
How about that, Ed, huh?

291
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,700
Why don't you just shut up?

292
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,900
Maybe you should've kept your
mouth shut, don't you think?

293
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,800
For once. For one night, you
should've kept your mouth shut.

294
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,800
I'm gonna miss
the Wheel of Fortune.

295
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
You're working my last nerve.

296
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,400
Did you mention it to her?

297
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,900
She said it was a great way
to help out the old people.

298
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,800
- See?
- But...

299
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,600
Maybe we wouldn't
make much money.

300
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,800
- She's right.
- She's not right. You know why?

301
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,200
This is a niche.
We found a niche...

302
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,600
where people need a service
that's not provided.

303
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,100
That's a niche?

304
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,800
That's exactly what
it's called in the business.

305
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,900
Hey, watch what he's doing.

306
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,500
Son of a bitch.

307
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,800
What is it? What is it?

308
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,700
- Jesus, man. It's Mr. Kott.
- From the supermarket?

309
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,500
Don't touch anybody
'cause they'll sue us all.

310
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,800
- Don't touch him.
- Mr. Kott, don't worry.

311
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,400
Open the door.

312
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,200
I can't open the door.
Put your hand on the door.

313
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,400
Open the door!
Get the stuff out of the car!

314
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,600
Hey, open the door!
Hey, sir! Open the door!

315
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,600
Open the door.
Put your hand on the door.

316
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,500
What are you doing, Jerry?
Move over.

317
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,800
Watch your hands.

318
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,400
Yeah, watch my hands!
Watch my hands is right!

319
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,000
Hurry up! Don't worry about it.
It's going to be OK.

320
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,100
- Give me that.
- I got it! I got it!

321
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,200
What are you doing?
That's bulletproof.

322
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,800
Watch! I got it!

323
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,500
Hey, hey! Stop! Shit!

324
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,400
Hold on. There it is!

325
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,600
Mr. Kott, don't worry.
Don't worry. We got you.

326
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,200
- What do we do?
- Get him to the hospital.

327
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,400
Take him to the hospital.

328
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,900
My back is gone.

329
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,100
What are you complaining about?
You got the feet.

330
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,000
What about the truck?
It's full of money.

331
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,700
Drive it back
and tell 'em what happened.

332
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,000
Right. Here's the keys.

333
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,900
We'll meet you there. Come on.
What are you doin'?

334
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,100
All right, all right.
Get him in the back.

335
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,100
Come on, stop complaining.

336
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,900
Stop, please. Come on.

337
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,900
Get off of me!

338
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,800
The old guy had a heart attack.

339
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,700
I brought the truck back.

340
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,400
What?

341
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,000
Jerry, no!
Jerry, Jerry, don't!

342
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,700
Come on.

343
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,000
Yeah, well, she's fired!

344
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,700
Jerry, just get down the steps.
Get down the steps.

345
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,800
How long
has this been goin' on?

346
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,400
- What?
- Answer me. How long?

347
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,000
Nothing's been going on.
Where's the car?

348
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,400
He had his hands all over you.

349
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,900
You're tellin' me
nothing's goin' on?

350
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,600
That's right. He's been
after me to have a drink.

351
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
- He's never grabbed me before.
- Oh, yeah, so this is a first.

352
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,200
- Jerry, where's the car?
- How come you didn't tell me?

353
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,400
- Where's the car?
- Answer me!

354
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,700
I didn't want you to beat him
up and get me fired, all right?

355
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,600
Now, where's the goddamn car?

356
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,200
It's at the hospital.

357
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,400
Well, then, call a taxi, Jerry.

358
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,900
What, are you kidding?

359
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,000
- That's right... no money.
- Where are you going?

360
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
- I'm trying to get home.
- Betty, they'll be here!

361
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,800
Jerry, you want to wait for
them, wait for them, all right?

362
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,700
You should have seen me
on the way to the hospital.

363
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:56,000
I ran every fuckin' red light.
It was beautiful.

364
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,500
I'm a hero.
We're heroes now. Heroes.

365
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,400
Great. I'm glad we saved
Ralph all his money.

366
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,400
We should go back
and break his fucking legs.

367
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,800
How much money you think is
in those bags every day, huh?

368
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,400
How many millions
you think is inside?

369
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,900
I don't know.

370
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,400
Maybe we should ask Betty.

371
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,700
Aw, come... no, no. Forget it.

372
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,100
Betty gets fired,
the place gets hit...

373
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,600
I'm an instant suspect.

374
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,400
Not the place, the truck.

375
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,600
The truck?

376
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,100
Yeah. Watch this car.
Watch this car. Watch this car.

377
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,000
Why didn't we think about this
when it was happening?

378
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,200
Speak for yourselves.

379
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,000
Because we're not
cut out for this.

380
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,500
Some people are.
For instance, criminals.

381
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,300
The guy was dying.
We were not prepared.

382
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,300
We are now a little bit more
familiar with the triangle.

383
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:51,100
- It's a Mickey Mouse operation.
- That's my point.

384
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,600
The actual pickup
is casual and sloppy.

385
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
We've witnessed it, right?

386
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,000
Sid, we cannot rob
an armored truck.

387
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Jerry, how you doing?

388
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Hi, Barney. What's happening?

389
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,600
Renovation around the corner.

390
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,000
How about you?

391
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,000
Are you, uh, full?

392
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,200
I'll give you a call.

393
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:20,000
Listen, the beauty of
this whole fucking thing is...

394
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,500
there's no middleman.
It's instant cash in bags.

395
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,700
What's wrong with you, Russ?
It's armed robbery!

396
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,000
Lower your fuckin' voice,
all right, idiot?

397
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,200
Fuckin' idiot.

398
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,800
It's not necessarily
armed robbery.

399
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
What do you mean,
"not necessarily"?

400
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,900
They carry guns!

401
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,500
Yeah, but it's only
armed robbery if we carry guns.

402
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,600
So what are are we gonna
do it with... mirrors?

403
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,200
- Fake weapons. Toys.
- I don't believe this.

404
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,400
Wait a second.
It's done all the time.

405
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,200
Somebody points a gun in your
face, what are you going to do?

406
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,400
Are you going to ask to see
the bullets? Of course not.

407
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,800
You're gonna assume
that's it's a deadly weapon.

408
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:54,000
All right? The thief
gets the benefit of the doubt.

409
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,200
It's kind of a rule of thumb.

410
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,100
The majority of handguns
in this country fire caps.

411
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,300
Caps.

412
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,900
- I love it.
- What?

413
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,700
We rob two dozen pastries.

414
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,400
So now we rob an armored car
with a cap gun.

415
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,800
It's brilliant.

416
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,600
- Nobody's gonna get hurt.
- Oh, I see.

417
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,100
- He's right.
- I'm right?

418
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,800
No, Jerry's right. We don't
rush into things like this.

419
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,700
Come on. You love this idea.

420
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,000
All right. Now, look,
we can do the driving thing.

421
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
- We'll start it tonight.
- OK, that's good. Exactly.

422
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,200
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

423
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,800
I'm gonna buy a notebook
to put everything on paper.

424
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,600
I thought you just said we're
going to do the car service!

425
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,400
Jerry, listen,
we're capable of doing...

426
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,300
two things at the same time,
all right?

427
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,900
I want to investigate
this truck thing.

428
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,600
And we'll do your little
car service, all right?

429
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,700
You could stay uncommitted.

430
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,400
Hey, Russ, get some graph paper.

431
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,100
Remember graph paper, Jerry?

432
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Will you move it, pops, huh?
Come on. Where you going?

433
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,400
We're sharing.

434
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,300
Yeah, well, it's separate fares.

435
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,900
Will you move this thing?

436
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,200
Separate fares?
We can call a taxi.

437
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,200
This is not my neighborhood.

438
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,800
We're across town here.

439
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,500
I'm taking a little detour, OK?
A little shortcut.

440
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,000
A what?

441
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,900
You should do something
about the breath.

442
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,100
Brush their teeth, something.

443
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,100
There's nothing wrong
with their breath, OK?

444
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,000
Are we lost?
What's the problem here?

445
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,500
There's no problem.

446
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,700
We're waiting for a passenger
pickup, so just relax.

447
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,200
Maybe it's the other end.
It smells awful in here.

448
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,800
He's right about those dogs.

449
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,000
You got a pair
of stinkin' dogs here!

450
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,100
Let me tell you something.

451
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,600
These dogs,
they smell better than you do.

452
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,200
- Says who?
- All right!

453
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,100
This is not a contest,
all right? We all stink!

454
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,300
You can take me home!

455
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,600
Why don't you just
shut your mouth?

456
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,400
I'll miss the news!
I'll miss everything!

457
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,200
Just relax, OK?
Don't get me started.

458
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,800
Just relax. You calm down.

459
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,800
That's it. I'm out of here.
I'm gonna take the bus.

460
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,700
How you gonna get on the bus
with the two dogs?

461
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,500
Don't worry about it, OK?
You happy now? Huh?

462
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,600
You happy? Come on.

463
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,100
I'm happy. You happy?

464
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,600
Here. Right over here.
Stay over here.

465
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,800
Come here now.

466
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,600
All right. Ready?

467
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,000
All right, here it comes.

468
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,400
- Thank you, driver.
- Ohh, man.

469
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,200
What's with the dogs?

470
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,800
They're seeing eye dogs, sir.

471
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,800
I heard about that bullshit.

472
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Well, the little one's
in training.

473
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,300
Get these animals
the fuck off my bus.

474
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,700
But they're seeing eye dogs.

475
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,800
Get the hell off the bus
with this shit!

476
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,200
I tried.

477
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,700
Come on.
There'll be another bus.

478
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,400
Want some?

479
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,500
Thanks a lot.

480
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,400
The buses
are running late today.

481
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,200
Yeah, what else is new?

482
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,000
Uh, thanks a lot.

483
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,200
I really appreciate this.
This is nice of you.

484
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,500
Do you want to come inside
and warm up?

485
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,000
Well, you know, the dogs...

486
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
No, it's all right.
My boss ain't here. Come on.

487
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,900
You're soaked, huh?

488
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,800
Were you blind on the bus?

489
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,600
Yeah. Sometimes it works.

490
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,600
It's hard to do. I've tried
being blind a couple of times.

491
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,000
Why is that?

492
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,800
For the experience.

493
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,200
- What's your name?
- Sid.

494
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,000
I'm Enid.

495
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,900
It's a nice place.

496
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,300
It's so secondhand.

497
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,500
Just make yourself comfortable.

498
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,400
Do you mind
if I tie the dogs up?

499
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,000
No, no. Go ahead.

500
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:17,300
If you want, you could
put your pants on the radiator.

501
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,700
You could sit in the room
back there.

502
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,400
This is my favorite.

503
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,200
Do people...
do they pay cash for furs?

504
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,700
- Cash?
- Mm-hmm.

505
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,100
Sometimes.

506
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,500
Are you a thief?

507
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,400
Why? Do I look like one?

508
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
Did you ever try being deaf?

509
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,900
Deaf is tougher than blind.

510
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,100
Remarkable.

511
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,200
No. It's all secondhand.

512
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,300
It's all used. Yeah.

513
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,200
Yeah, we have hats.

514
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,500
What size is your head?

515
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,000
All right.

516
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,700
We tighten up.
No more shared rides...

517
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,500
no more carrying groceries.
Things like that. It'll be...

518
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,800
- Jerry, Jerry.
- What?

519
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,700
Are you kidding me or what?
I'm sick of these old people.

520
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,400
Forget it. I'm out of this.

521
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,300
I see real potential here,
Russ.

522
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,800
Yeah, you want to see potential.

523
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,200
Your wife
wants to see potential.

524
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,200
Sid and his... his puppies,
he wants to see potential.

525
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,600
Well, personally, as a man...

526
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,000
unencumbered by
any sort of woman...

527
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,100
personally, I think the whole
thing is a little too serviel.

528
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,100
- What?
- Too serviel.

529
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,200
- Servile.
- Yeah, servile. It sucks.

530
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,800
What the fuck happened?

531
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,500
What's this?

532
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,400
Russell, is that you?

533
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,100
She's talking to you!

534
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,400
I'm talking to...

535
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,900
What are you doing in the dark?

536
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,800
People don't sit in a dark room.

537
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,000
Get out!

538
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,600
- What did you say?
- Get out!

539
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,800
What did you say?
Nobody ever did that to me.

540
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,400
What's goin' on?
What's he doing?

541
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,600
What the hell's
going on in here?

542
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,400
Guys, how you doing?

543
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,800
I got to get back.
I got to feed the dogs.

544
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,900
You want my phone number?

545
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,200
If someone else answers,
just hang up fast.

546
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,200
See you.

547
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,800
I enjoyed meeting you.

548
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,800
Yeah. Me, too.

549
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,900
Come on.

550
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,600
Take it easy, huh?

551
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,300
We'll get our chance.

552
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,300
Come on, we're out of it.

553
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,700
From now on,
we'll do the truck thing.

554
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,600
They raped my car.

555
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,200
Stop.

556
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,400
I saw him in your room
the other night.

557
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,600
Who?

558
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,600
What's his face...
your cop-in-law.

559
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,800
- In my room?
- Yep. By the closet.

560
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,600
Sometimes he borrows
my shoe polish.

561
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,400
You know what it costs
to take a bus to Los Angeles?

562
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,800
It's only eighty-nine dollars
one way.

563
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,500
- A bus?
- Gets you there, doesn't it?

564
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,800
Come on.
Then we're out of here.

565
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:30,100
Oh, we got to send them
a check or a major credit card.

566
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,200
Who?

567
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,000
The casino.
I made the reservation.

568
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
- Why?
- In three weeks.

569
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,600
'Cause that's the only way
they hold the reservation.

570
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,300
- What's the matter?
- I want to be consulted.

571
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,000
- We can split it.
- It's not splitting it.

572
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I don't want you
arranging my life like that.

573
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,200
What the f... What is that?

574
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,700
Jesus Christ!

575
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,700
Are you embarrassed
about being seen with me?

576
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,000
I mean, why don't we ever get
out of bed and go somewhere?

577
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:06,600
Listen, I'm out of a job
right now, remember?

578
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,800
My own mother's after me
for money, all right?

579
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:14,000
- Am I too young or something?
- No, you're not too young.

580
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,800
Come on. Things are gonna
change for me, all right?

581
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,200
Things will change.

582
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,900
Like what? You'll get a job?

583
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,400
That's what I'm waiting for,
right?

584
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,400
Maybe that's not something
you wait for.

585
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,400
What does that mean? Hey,
Laurie, what does that mean?

586
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,000
Maybe it's something you do.

587
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,800
Yeah?
What's that supposed to mean?

588
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,200
Where you goin'?
Laurie! Laurie!

589
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:50,000
We want to isolate the truck.
Get the guy alone somewhere.

590
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,800
I see that as the basic premise.

591
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,600
Where's the couch?

592
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,800
They took the couch back, Jerry.
Can we concentrate here?

593
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,500
What is the point of
keeping this around here, Sid?

594
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,200
I mean, this is unhealthy.

595
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,300
That's why
you don't meet anybody.

596
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,900
- Mind your own business.
- How long's it been? Ten years?

597
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,500
Mind your own business, Russ.

598
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,900
You wash those dogs?

599
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,800
You don't wash dogs
in cold weather.

600
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,200
How do you clean them?

601
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,100
- They're not dirty.
- They smell.

602
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:21,600
- They don't smell.
- They do. Am I nuts?

603
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,000
Sid, tell the truth.

604
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,900
You don't think
those dogs smell? Come on.

605
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,200
They smell like dogs, Russ.

606
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,700
You know, some people happen
to enjoy the smell of dogs.

607
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,700
They stink.
Maybe a little right guard.

608
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,600
You know, those are girl dogs.

609
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,600
What do you see
in those little things?

610
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,900
Sid, do you fuck those dogs?

611
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,700
Come on, Sid. Tell the truth.

612
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,800
I swear to God.
I won't say a word.

613
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,100
As a matter of fact,
I don't even think...

614
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,200
it's that outrageous.
I think it's romantic.

615
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

616
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,300
I tried calling first,
but your number's disconnected.

617
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,800
Yeah, I know.
I'm changing carriers.

618
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,400
The interim
has been driving me crazy.

619
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,800
Could I come in? See the dogs?

620
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:13,800
Get out of my way.

621
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,400
Hi. How you doing?

622
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,300
Good. Could I come in?

623
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,600
Actually, I got kind of
a business meeting...

624
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:36,100
going on now.
Can I get back to you?

625
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,300
I thought maybe we could
get together tonight.

626
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,800
Tonight sounds good.

627
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,800
You think maybe
I could give you a call...

628
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,700
after I know
how my day's shaping up?

629
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,500
Mmm... OK. I'll be
at the shop till 6:00.

630
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,800
What's this?

631
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,100
See you.

632
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,200
Girls knocking on your door,
huh, Sid?

633
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,400
Yeah, well, it happens, Russ.

634
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,600
Who was that?
A friend of the dogs?

635
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,900
I tell you what... I got
a plan I want to discuss.

636
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,000
You guys want to discuss it
or forget about it?

637
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,200
Do it.

638
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,100
All right, in order
to isolate the driver...

639
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,500
the truck's got to break down.

640
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:22,900
Now, we attack the gas line.

641
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,400
We drill a hole in the line
while the truck's parked...

642
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,800
in the parking lot.
There's no night watchman.

643
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,100
- And then we plug up the hole.
- And?

644
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,500
When the driver takes off
the next day...

645
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:36,300
to pick up the cash,
we pull the plug, we follow.

646
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:40,400
The truck runs out of gas.
We're right there.

647
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,200
What if he runs out of gas
in front of a police station?

648
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,200
We decide
where he'll run out of gas.

649
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,700
How fast he's traveling
and how fast it leaks out.

650
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,200
Exactly. Our best bet's
probably right about here.

651
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,900
Something's not right.

652
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,600
What?
This is completely doable.

653
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,500
I don't know, Sid.
Something's not right. Trust me.

654
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,900
Who's this girl?

655
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,300
Somebody that I met. Can we
stick with the issues here?

656
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,800
Look at this.

657
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,600
"L" ten, "R" seventeen,
"L" twenty.

658
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,800
Where does she work?

659
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,800
She doesn't work.
She's a student.

660
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,100
It's a combination.

661
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,200
Maybe it's the combination
to her gym locker.

662
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,700
You want an explanation?
I'll give you an explanation.

663
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,000
What are you gonna do,
borrow her sneakers?

664
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,500
She's a romantic.

665
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,000
It happens to be
the combination to her heart.

666
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,400
Yuck it up.

667
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,700
I need air, OK?

668
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,100
Gas is combustible.

669
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,900
One spark from the drill...

670
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,900
and ka-boom.

671
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,600
- That's it.
- Shit.

672
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,300
Oh, well. Come on.

673
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,900
I'm starving. I'm hungry.
I can't take this.

674
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,200
Good try, Sid.
Nice plan. Forget it.

675
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,000
Wait a minute. I got it.

676
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,700
We go with
the exact same plan...

677
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,400
only we don't drill
the gas line.

678
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,600
We drill the gym locker.

679
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,800
- The radiator.
- Exactly.

680
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,500
We show we're good samaritans.
We offer assistance.

681
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:08,200
What, and then...
"Oh, excuse me, sir.

682
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,100
"Can I get the bags of money,
please?"

683
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,200
We can't rule out
minor violence.

684
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,000
Come on. The guy's
an old fuckin' bastard!

685
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,100
There's three of us.

686
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:17,100
He's an old fucking bastard
with a gun.

687
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:20,400
Your wife just lost the only
paying job that we have.

688
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,500
I don't know how
you're gonna pay your rent...

689
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,500
but I just got
my eviction notice.

690
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,100
I can't do this.

691
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:30,800
What? What?

692
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,600
You got a message
from that security company...

693
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,100
Lion Security.

694
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,500
Did you apply there?

695
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,900
From Mr. Kott.
Probably wanted to say thanks.

696
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,600
What's to eat?

697
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,600
There's nothin' to eat.
Nothin' in here.

698
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,000
You said you ate.

699
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,400
I'm talking about like a snack.
Like a snack. A lousy cracker.

700
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,300
- Well, you see any crackers?
- Uh, no.

701
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,100
Well, then no crackers.
Have some cereal.

702
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,000
It's nighttime,
for Christ's sake.

703
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,900
Well, Jerry, don't tell
your stomach, all right?

704
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,600
You expect me to eat
a bowl of milk and cereal...

705
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,600
with a can of beer?
It doesn't go. It doesn't mix.

706
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,900
I want something solid,
something with bones.

707
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,600
You're not the only one who
wants something around here.

708
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,700
Oh, really?
Well, what do you want so bad?

709
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:28,900
Forget it.

710
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,700
No, I want to hear this.
What do you want?

711
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,100
I want a washer and dryer.
How's that?

712
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,300
Oh, a washer and dryer.
I'll get a checkbook. Hold on.

713
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,700
Ricky,
you see my checkbook, huh?

714
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,400
You got
a lot of fucking nerve...

715
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,800
asking me
for a washer and dryer.

716
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,500
Yeah, that's right!
I want a washer and dryer!

717
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,200
I gotta get myself
to the laundromat...

718
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,300
dragging him on the bus.
It's raining, it's wet...

719
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,800
he's screaming,
don't have no stroller.

720
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,700
I see. Now it's a stroller
you want. Anything else?

721
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,900
You know what else I want?
I want designer clothes...

722
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,600
and I want a VCR with remote
and I want a sauna...

723
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,100
and I want
central air conditioning...

724
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,700
and I want freaking rugs!

725
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,600
- Get off me!
- Calm down!

726
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:11,200
All right, all right,
don't cry, don't cry.

727
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,800
Jesus, I'm sorry.
Betty, I'm sorry.

728
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,700
All right?

729
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,500
- Don't worry.
- I'm scared.

730
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:21,300
OK, all right.
It's gonna be OK.

731
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,800
Jerry, you don't know that.

732
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,400
- How do you know that?
- 'Cause I do. Don't worry.

733
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,700
I want you to go in there, and
I want you to apologize to him.

734
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,000
- What?
- Go down there and apologize.

735
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,200
You tell him you lost control,
and it won't happen again.

736
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,500
Just go down there,
and you do that.

737
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,600
That creep?

738
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,800
You just go down there,
and you go get my job back!

739
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,100
- No.
- Just do it!

740
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:50,400
I'm not playing with you!
Just go down there and do it!

741
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,500
I think I'll have that cereal
after all.

742
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:05,200
There's no milk.

743
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,000
You're out of your mind.

744
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,400
I made popcorn.

745
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,600
I can show you
better than I can tell you.

746
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,700
Look at that guy's suit.

747
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,100
- Russ, have some.
- This is the layout.

748
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,700
Wrigley Field,
where we pull the strike.

749
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,000
Plenty neat.

750
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,100
What are you watching, Ma?

751
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,800
What's going on in here?

752
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,700
Police department?
I want to report a holdup.

753
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,800
Wrigley Field.

754
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:05,900
Units 2-7 and 2-8,
investigate a 5-6-1.

755
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:09,600
4-5 district.
Investigate a 5-6-1.

756
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:17,900
So, uh, Ralph, I'm, uh...

757
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:21,600
you know,
I'm sorry I hit you, and, uh...

758
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,600
I must've got the wrong idea
about what you were doing.

759
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,700
I don't really understand
why you were touching my wife.

760
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:28,400
I think
you should really just not...

761
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,800
Boys don't always grow up.

762
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,600
They age, they put on weight...

763
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,500
they lose sap, lose hair.

764
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:45,300
They grow lumps and warts.

765
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,400
They have regrets.

766
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,000
They lose their tempers,
and they blame women...

767
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,400
but they do not automatically
grow up and become men.

768
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,600
I should have moved out, right?

769
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:02,400
Did you ever go to Los Angeles?

770
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,500
- Been to Las Vegas once.
- Oh, yeah?

771
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,200
Went there with a friend.
There was a basket of fruit.

772
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,000
- Fruit?
- In the room. And robes.

773
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,200
The hotel supplied robes.

774
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,500
I didn't see much of the city.

775
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,900
So, what's in Los Angeles?

776
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,800
Some chick I've been seeing...

777
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,700
she keeps talking about
going to Los Angeles.

778
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:28,600
Go with her.

779
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,500
You can always come back, baby.
It's not the Bermuda Triangle.

780
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:37,400
- She's a kid.
- She's not eleven, is she?

781
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:45,500
She's one of those girls,
you know...

782
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,400
she wants something,
you know what I mean?

783
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,700
An intangible thing.

784
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,500
Hey, everybody wants something.

785
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,200
Yeah, well,
she's trying to arrange my life.

786
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:56,700
Somebody's got to do it.

787
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,000
She's good-Iooking,
good in bed...

788
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,100
and she's crazy about you,
am I right?

789
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,100
What a predicament.

790
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:25,600
What's this?

791
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,500
- Come on. Shake it.
- What?

792
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,800
It stimulates
the movement of a car.

793
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,100
Watch where
you're shaking that.

794
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,400
Hey, you want to shake this?

795
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,800
- We're timing this.
- I'll be right back.

796
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,100
It's 2:30.
I gotta walk the dogs.

797
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,400
Hey, Sid, we're rotating here.

798
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,600
If I don't walk 'em now,
they're gonna start whining.

799
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,100
I'm gonna start whining.

800
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,300
Will you forget the dogs
for one minute today?

801
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,600
Hey, could you take this,
please? Take it.

802
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:13,100
Put it down. Come on. Come on.
Let me in there.

803
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:14,400
Start shaking it.

804
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,400
I'll start shaking it
as soon as l...

805
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,300
Watch my pants. You're
getting it near my pants.

806
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,800
Watch him.

807
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,600
- This is asinine.
- You got a better idea?

808
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,300
It's not even hot yet.

809
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:30,600
Maybe we should enlarge
the hole.

810
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:33,200
I think maybe
we should have two holes.

811
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,900
One hole.

812
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,700
It's just a thought.

813
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:38,800
Hello, ladies.

814
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,000
Jesus Christ!

815
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,000
What a day.

816
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,300
How you doing?

817
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,300
- I'm gonna quit.
- How come?

818
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:15,400
She makes me feel
like Cinderella.

819
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,900
Did you read the envelope?

820
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,600
Yeah, I did.
I think you're crazy.

821
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,200
You'd be the first person
they'd suspect...

822
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,400
if the place got robbed.

823
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,600
I hadn't thought of that.

824
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,400
Do you think
I have a death wish?

825
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,700
No. I mean, I don't know.

826
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,600
You coming?

827
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:56,200
I feel like being in bed
with you.

828
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,600
Really?

829
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,700
You know, that's... that's nice.

830
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:10,000
- I find it encouraging.
- What?

831
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,000
What's so funny?

832
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,300
Do you think men
are afraid of women?

833
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:21,600
I don't know.
I mean, in general, no.

834
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:25,600
I just think that most men
find women to be unpredictable.

835
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:29,200
I guess that's what
makes him so uneasy.

836
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,200
I mean, you know,
men in general.

837
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:36,400
We going to your place?

838
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,400
No, I'm not going home.
I got a meeting right now.

839
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,700
Can you make a right turn
on the next corner?

840
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,500
Your girlfriends
are in the kitchen.

841
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,700
You're late.

842
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,000
What, only seven minutes.
So what?

843
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
What's the hurry?

844
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,100
Gonna rob a Carvel's?

845
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:26,400
We're going to the movies.

846
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:31,700
Why don't you use a glass?

847
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,800
We got to go.

848
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:41,500
Come on.

849
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,400
Who's that?

850
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,000
Who is it?

851
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,700
It's the neighbor's kid. Nobody.
What do you mean, who is it?

852
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,700
Throw it up.

853
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,500
What, are you stupid?
You did that on purpose.

854
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,600
This is it.

855
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,500
What?

856
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:30,700
Oh, God!

857
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,200
Take the drill out.

858
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,800
Pull it. Give me this.

859
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:54,100
Hey, Sid, put the light on.

860
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:09,700
Here. What happened?
Did it work?

861
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,400
Yes, it worked perfect.

862
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,800
- We had to kill a dog.
- A dog?

863
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:17,300
One of those attack dogs that
was gonna eat the both of us.

864
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,300
- How'd you kill it?
- We drilled it.

865
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,500
Would you shut up?

866
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,800
We drilled it
right in the fuckin' throat.

867
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,400
- He did.
- You drilled it?

868
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:36,600
We're at Sid's place at 2:00.
We're out of there by 2:10.

869
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,600
Go to the supermarket at 2:25,
truck comes there around 2:30.

870
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,400
The guy's in there
about ten minutes...

871
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,000
then he pulls the plug.

872
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,300
Hey, Sid,
when we get done here...

873
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:50,000
maybe you should do something
about your arm there.

874
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,700
- I'm done now.
- You're not done now, Sid.

875
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,800
We just said we're gonna
go through this one more time.

876
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,200
Sid, the dogs can wait.

877
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,400
Why don't you lay off
with the dog thing, huh, Jerry?

878
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:03,800
Hey, Sid, pal?
The danish and the coffee.

879
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,400
How about
you pay for your food...

880
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:06,900
before you make
the dramatic exit?

881
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,800
Pay first
and then dramatic exit.

882
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,900
How's this?

883
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,800
Pay for everything
and leave a tip this time.

884
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:15,700
Come on.
That dog was comin' at us.

885
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,200
The dog
was coming like this at us.

886
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,200
All right? It was an accident.

887
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,800
It was an accident, all right?
Don't walk out, Sid.

888
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:23,900
We're gonna make this
a two-man thing now?

889
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,400
It's a little late for that.

890
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,400
Maybe if he found himself
a girl this time...

891
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:28,600
did you ever think of that?

892
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,100
A woman, Sid,
instead of a fuzzy dog, right?

893
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,000
You get a little perspective,
Sid?

894
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,400
Yeah, go ahead and leave.

895
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:38,500
We're not backing down
from this thing. Listen to me.

896
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,500
I got Betty up against
a goddamn cliff. I got no...

897
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,800
What are we supposed to do?

898
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:47,100
How are we gonna do this
without him?

899
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,200
Show me how it's gonna work
with two people.

900
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,100
Oh, man. OK.

901
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:23,200
Loving you

902
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,100
Is easy 'cause you're beautiful

903
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,900
Making love to you

904
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:32,400
Is all I want to do

905
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,900
Jesus Christ!

906
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,000
Come on! Relax!
I borrowed it from Ed.

907
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,400
You took his gun?

908
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,400
He won't miss it. He's got one
for every day of the week.

909
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:20,200
Russ, man, you said no guns.
What the hell is wrong with you?

910
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,500
Look who showed up.

911
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,100
Here.

912
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,700
Put it on.

913
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:06,300
All right.

914
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:11,000
Can't get this down.

915
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,100
It's the cops!

916
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,800
Don't turn around!

917
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,900
Just relax.
We haven't done nothing yet.

918
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:26,800
All right? Just calm yourself.
Take off your mask.

919
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,000
- Take off your mask.
- All right.

920
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,800
Shit.

921
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,100
- What do we do?
- Look who it is.

922
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:40,400
It's Ed the cop.
Look at him. Turn the car.

923
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,900
Turn the car right here!
Turn the car.

924
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,000
Shit!

925
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:47,900
Where you going?

926
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,400
We got to shake him, all right?

927
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:50,600
We'll pick up the truck
when he comes around.

928
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,800
He knows, man.
He fucking knows.

929
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,400
He doesn't know nothing. He's
here just to bust our balls.

930
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,300
That's what he's here for.
Just go straight.

931
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,300
Look at him. He's still on us.

932
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:17,200
Make this left.

933
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,700
He blew a tire.

934
01:14:28,700 --> 01:14:30,000
What are you, a fucking idiot?

935
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,900
I fucking did it.
He fucking wrecked.

936
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,400
He crashed, and we almost died.

937
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,600
Aw, fuck.

938
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,200
Moneybags coming up.

939
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:50,600
He should be overheating now.

940
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:52,400
He checks the gauge,
sees the steam under the hood.

941
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:55,200
He's probably
scratching his balls right now.

942
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,800
He's slowing down
around this bend.

943
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,900
He stops the truck.
He's definitely overheating.

944
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,000
Slow down, slow down.

945
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,900
He's gonna try and start
the engine again, all right?

946
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,300
So we'll give him a moment...

947
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,500
while he figures out
what the fuck he's gonna do.

948
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,000
He's out of the truck.

949
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,400
He pops the hood, he leans in,
and he takes a peek.

950
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,200
- Shit.
- You had this timed?

951
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:22,200
Son of a bitch!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

952
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,000
Damn it, Sid.

953
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,900
You're a... you're a jerk.

954
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:33,300
It was an educated guess.

955
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,600
Educated guess? Come on,
you're the mechanic, Sid.

956
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,300
Look, I painted cars.
I didn't design them.

957
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:00,900
All right, pass him, pass him.

958
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:03,100
- What?
- Cut him off!

959
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,300
Come on, it gets busy
down there. Just...

960
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:07,600
What are you doing?

961
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,600
- He's stopping.
- Shit!

962
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:18,000
Are you nuts? You don't push
someone's foot on the gas!

963
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,600
Look at this.

964
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,200
It's just the front panel.
What's the big deal?

965
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:23,100
- Are you gonna take care of it?
- Was I driving, Jerry?

966
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:24,600
Shut up!
You know what my deductible is?

967
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,600
Anyone hurt?

968
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,100
Why the hell
did you put on your brakes?

969
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,300
I was overheating,
so I put on the brakes.

970
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:33,200
Jesus,
you guys come out of nowhere...

971
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,800
What you wearing masks for?

972
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,200
Because we're going to rob you,
asshole.

973
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,900
He's got the keys to the back.

974
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,900
Shit!

975
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:51,400
Aw, son of a bitch.

976
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:03,200
Let's get out of here.

977
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,800
We got time.
Look, he's going for help.

978
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:06,900
We got about
three fucking minutes.

979
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,000
Just get the stuff, Sid.

980
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,300
We can't get in
without the keys.

981
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:11,100
We'll bust in! Get the stuff!

982
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:17,100
Give me the thing. Come on.
Give me that.

983
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,600
Move over. Move over.

984
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:31,200
Don't... don't fuck with me!

985
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,600
Lie down!

986
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:39,400
Stay down! Sons of bitches.

987
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,200
Fuck this.

988
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,900
Oh, God,
please get me out of this.

989
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:47,100
I'll never do anything
like this again.

990
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:24,600
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?

991
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,200
Come on. Let's get out of here.

992
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,600
What are you doing?

993
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,600
Jesus, this gun feels real.

994
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,400
- Sid, no!
- Don't!

995
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:05,700
I'm going to drop myself off.

996
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:09,500
I don't want Betty
to see the car like this.

997
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,400
You know?

998
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:15,800
I couldn't believe it.

999
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,100
The man said they'd been
investigating Ralph's books...

1000
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,400
for, like, three months.

1001
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,600
When they got
all these complaints...

1002
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,400
from the customers
about firing me...

1003
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,200
they decided
to do something about it.

1004
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:27,000
And check it out.
I'm getting back pay.

1005
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,100
- Do you believe it?
- Back pay?

1006
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:33,100
Yeah, so you see...
it's all good.

1007
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,100
And they asked me
if I was interested in his job.

1008
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,500
Manager?

1009
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,800
Well, I'll have
to take some courses.

1010
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,400
But I don't know
if I want to do that.

1011
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,100
I know.

1012
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,700
Maybe I'll get to be manager.
How about that, huh?

1013
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,000
Sid Dunleavy?

1014
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:43,600
This your first time?

1015
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,800
Don't worry about it.
No big deal.

1016
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,600
They're ready for you.

1017
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:05,400
It is my pleasure
to introduce to you first...

1018
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,900
the three
quick-thinking young men.

1019
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:10,400
On the day of November 4th...

1020
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:13,200
these young men
saved the life of Mr. Kott...

1021
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:14,800
who suffered a heart attack...

1022
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,900
while driving
an armored vehicle.

1023
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:19,200
Gentlemen, stand up, please.

1024
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:22,800
Up.

1025
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:29,500
Not only did they rush Mr. Kott
to the emergency room...

1026
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,000
but they had
the presence of mind...

1027
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,700
to safely return the truck...

1028
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:35,900
and the $30,000 in cash
it was carrying.

1029
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:38,900
Gentlemen, you're
a fine example for us all.

1030
01:24:38,900 --> 01:24:41,900
On behalf of the city
and Lion Security...

1031
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:45,800
I say thank you
and God bless you...

1032
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:49,900
and present you each
with a City Samaritan award.

1033
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:51,600
