1
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,364
With your index finger,
I want you to touch your nose.

2
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,130
Do it with each side.

3
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:43,442
Get your hands
out of your pockets.

4
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,511
Don't touch the wall.

5
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,550
One, two, three, four, five.

6
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,685
Five, four, three, two, one.

7
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,087
All right, very good.
Have a seat.

8
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,133
If it is your second DWI,

9
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:12,771
your license will be suspended
for up to a year.

10
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:15,374
I... I'm going to...
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

11
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:16,475
You gotta go to the bathroom?

12
00:01:16,477 --> 00:01:17,543
Yeah. You gonna get sick?

13
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:19,178
Nope.

14
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,279
All right.

15
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,672
Let's go, Kevin.

16
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:33,886
Shit.

17
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,637
Prisoner is loose
in the building.

18
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,011
<i>Good morning, everybody.</i>

19
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:08,814
<i>KTRX AM 440, Des Moines.</i>

20
00:04:08,816 --> 00:04:10,649
<i>It is just before 6:00 a.m.</i>

21
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,417
<i>Skies are cloudy.</i>

22
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,820
<i>And Tom Thompson,</i>
<i>a mechanic from Marshalltown...</i>

23
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:55,627
¶ We walked along the shadows ¶

24
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:59,064
¶ Later in the afternoon ¶

25
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:10,876
¶ We stood like strangers ¶

26
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:15,747
¶ And the sunlight
rushing through ¶

27
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,649
<i>Socrates is quoted as saying,</i>

28
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:22,054
<i>"Nothing is to be preferred</i>
<i>before justice."</i>

29
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,489
<i>It's what we seek</i>
<i>when we're wronged,</i>

30
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:28,427
<i>but like all philosophy,</i>
<i>this is simply a hypothesis.</i>

31
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,862
<i>Monday started out</i>
<i>like any other day:</i>

32
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:34,599
<i>Wake up, kiss my wife Nancy,</i>
<i>run three miles.</i>

33
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,703
<i>My mind was sharp,</i>
<i>my body agile.</i>

34
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:39,571
<i>But since I passed the bar,</i>

35
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,607
<i>I just needed a couple of easy</i>
<i>victories to keep me going,</i>

36
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,076
<i>to keep truth on my side.</i>

37
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:45,744
Good morning. Hi.

38
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,720
Gracey. Anybody get hurt today?

39
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:55,887
Every day, boss.

40
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,523
You have three messages
on your desk.

41
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,592
Only three?

42
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:04,062
<i>In the last year,</i>
<i>I had come to believe</i>

43
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,530
<i>that the only way</i>
<i>to keep my head above water</i>

44
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,466
<i>was to take cases</i>

45
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:09,935
<i>where I had to set</i>
<i>my own moral beliefs aside.</i>

46
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,637
<i>And here I am.</i>

47
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,406
<i>Three miles every day,</i>

48
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:17,776
<i>trying to convince myself</i>
<i>that it's all worth it.</i>

49
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:19,010
Jury, have you reached
a verdict?

50
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,645
Yes, Your Honor, we have.

51
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,147
How do you find the defendant?

52
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,849
Not liable, Your Honor.

53
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,917
Case dismissed.

54
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,027
Look, I'm sorry.

55
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,863
They're lying,
can't you see that?

56
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:42,100
I know, I know.

57
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:44,636
Can I give you
some bus fare home?

58
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,198
You've got to be kidding me.

59
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,415
His name's Otis.

60
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,682
Who's that, the owner?

61
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,118
Yeah.

62
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,187
Otis.

63
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,625
Look at these.

64
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:10,028
Which one's real,
which one's fake?

65
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,831
Hmm.

66
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:15,534
Well, uh, they're both zircons.

67
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:17,702
Fuckin' worthless, man.

68
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,671
Come on, man.
Nobody can tell the difference.

69
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,193
It's like a Lincoln
from a Cadillac.

70
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,743
Look, we go on the road
with this shit,

71
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,478
we're make us a fortune.

72
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,680
How do you know?

73
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,115
Know what?

74
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:33,084
The difference between
a Lincoln and a Cadillac?

75
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:36,087
My dad drives a Cadillac,
and it ain't no fucking Lincoln.

76
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:39,825
All I'm saying is
I want us to be partners, okay?

77
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,794
I'll take care of you.
Don't worry about a thing.

78
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,156
Yeah, boy,
you don't believe me?

79
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,601
I don't trust you, Eric.

80
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:53,705
Who pays your bills?

81
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,106
Me.

82
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,508
Who sits up with you
all night long

83
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,509
when you're depressed?

84
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,110
Me. And, you don't trust me?

85
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,812
Kevin, come on?

86
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,181
You patronize me.

87
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:06,117
You-you... You tell me all the
things you think I want to hear,

88
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:09,020
and then you use me.

89
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:10,755
I mean, you still
haven't fuckin' paid me.

90
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:12,724
I sold two grand worth of shit
for you, and I want my cut.

91
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,092
All right, take it.

92
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:15,694
You sell;
Keep whatever you want.

93
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:16,761
They're fucking worthless, man!

94
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,763
They're zircons.
I just said that!

95
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,004
Come here.

96
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,741
Come on.

97
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:35,914
Hey, you used to be
so different.

98
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,757
You were still a virgin
when I met you.

99
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,826
Oh, fuck you, man.

100
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,633
Nobody's gonna see. Come on.

101
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,770
I'll give you your money.
I will.

102
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,642
Put your fuckin' dick away,
Eric.

103
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,179
Kevin, I'm sorry, man.

104
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,825
Look, it's only
your third case.

105
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:23,161
You can get your ass handed
to you in personal injury.

106
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:27,098
Wow, now I'm getting advice
from my paralegal.

107
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,970
Yeah, with six years experience
in the courtroom, as you know.

108
00:09:31,972 --> 00:09:34,139
Besides, I only have to
pass the bar.

109
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,107
Iowa bar is tough.

110
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,810
Yeah, how many times
you take it?

111
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,879
Once. First to finish.

112
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,615
Liar.

113
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:46,885
Wow, that's not bad
for a Philosophy major.

114
00:09:46,887 --> 00:09:48,353
You never did tell me
how you went

115
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,689
from Socrates
to the penal code.

116
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,058
It's not that much
of a leap, really.

117
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,859
I mean, it goes back
to the Romans.

118
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,695
Plato wrote
whole volumes of law

119
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,997
for the King of Syracuse
in Greece.

120
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,732
Law is built on theory.

121
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:02,000
Sure, what's right and wrong.

122
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:04,603
Exactly. All right,
take, for example, today.

123
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:07,973
Our client completely refused
a field sobriety test,

124
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:10,709
he refused arrest,
and he got smacked for it.

125
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:13,078
Now, do I agree
with what the cops did?

126
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,613
No.

127
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,048
It's that manipulation,
that balance of power,

128
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,184
that made me
want to become a lawyer.

129
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:22,120
We're the great equalizers,
Monica.

130
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,856
It's not my third case.

131
00:10:24,858 --> 00:10:25,857
I know. Right.

132
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:26,858
It's your fourth.

133
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:31,029
Look, honestly,

134
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,198
you've got to
play the jury more.

135
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,335
Right and wrong is something
they decide in their gut.

136
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,704
You can't expect them
to absorb all those facts.

137
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:42,374
They need a hook, you know,
something to grasp.

138
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:45,143
The jury today
bought that cop's story.

139
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,712
Especially juror number four.

140
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:50,148
Yeah, well, foreman's
usually a dominant white male.

141
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,251
And, nobody wants to believe
that cops hurt innocent people.

142
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,786
Nobody. Not even me.

143
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:57,956
All right, no more
police brutality cases.

144
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,791
They're impossible to win.
I'm serious.

145
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:02,293
You're the boss. Yes, I am.

146
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:05,930
I got to go study
for that brutal lowa bar.

147
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:06,931
Yes, you do.

148
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,867
And when I pass,
I expect a raise.

149
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:12,237
Counselor, we need to win
a couple of cases first.

150
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:15,373
Don't think too much.
It's not good for you.

151
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,409
Thanks, appreciate that.

152
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,678
Nighty-night. Nighty-night.

153
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:25,050
I got it. I got your car.

154
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,352
Hey, look who's
home late again!

155
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:32,257
Hey, Daddy. Hey, buddy.

156
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,391
Where's Bert?

157
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,993
Bert and Clark
had a little fight.

158
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,336
Any blood shed?

159
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,005
Bert was mean to me.

160
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,273
Bert's in his room.

161
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,341
Hmm.

162
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:54,979
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you gotta
give his mommy a kiss first.

163
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,785
Honey, what's wrong?

164
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,089
What do you think?

165
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:05,990
You lost?

166
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:11,229
I'll go talk to Bert.

167
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,964
Okay.

168
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:29,814
Whoosh.

169
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,021
Tough day, partner?

170
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,857
What happened?

171
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:41,226
Well, we were playing cars,
and I wanted to race them

172
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,428
to see who was the fastest.

173
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,165
And I started to race them,
and Clark tried to stop me,

174
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,533
and I hit him.

175
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:52,470
Oh, well,
you're his big brother, Bert.

176
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:56,875
You gotta protect him,

177
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:59,844
'cause that's what
big brothers do.

178
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,479
Okay, bud? Okay.

179
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,548
I love you. Love you, too.

180
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,985
All right, so I am gonna
send Mommy in,

181
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,553
and she'll bring some milk,

182
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,021
but I don't want
any more fighting.

183
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,289
Okay? Okay.

184
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,091
Promise? Yes.

185
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,425
Okay. Good night, bud.

186
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,827
Good night.

187
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:23,168
<i>The contestants came</i>
<i>from all over the country,</i>

188
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,435
<i>driving all sort of cars...</i>

189
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:26,504
You talk to him?

190
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:30,308
Stu, did you talk to him?

191
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,511
He's okay.

192
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:36,147
He's a good boy.

193
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,082
Maybe Bert and Clark
shouldn't share a room.

194
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,083
Why not?

195
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:40,852
They fight constantly.

196
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,974
Yeah, well, they have to learn
how to get along;

197
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:48,259
How to make compromises.

198
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,581
Can you take Bert
to soccer practice on Friday?

199
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,301
I just...

200
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,903
I just thought this was
open and shut case.

201
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:02,907
I mean, now the guy
has got no job,

202
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:04,976
no income,

203
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,414
no car.

204
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:24,629
Hey sweetie, can't you wait
until dinner, huh?

205
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,297
And go put on a shirt
before you sit

206
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,699
down at the table, okay, hun?
Yes, ma'am.

207
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,636
Stop it. Get out of here.

208
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,271
You're going out tonight,
aren't you?

209
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:36,040
Oh, come on. You're hardly
ever home anymore.

210
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,543
I'm 21 years old, guys.
Don't worry.

211
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,379
It's my job to worry.
It's in the Mom handbook.

212
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:45,283
I'm driving up to Marshalltown.

213
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,051
Really? To see who?

214
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,120
Nobody.

215
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,058
¶ He's got a girlfriend
in Marshalltown ¶

216
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,393
No.

217
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,595
I mean, you know,
there are girls there,

218
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,431
just none of them
happen to be my girlfriend.

219
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:06,088
What do you think, Dad?

220
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:07,906
You think the girls are prettier
here, or in Marshalltown?

221
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:09,240
I think the prettiest girl
in the world

222
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,075
is sitting right at this table.

223
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,076
Right now.

224
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,045
Oh, you.

225
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:20,685
Hey, you really wanna drive an
hour all the up to Marshalltown?

226
00:15:20,687 --> 00:15:23,054
It's an hour. It's fine.

227
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,222
This guy Eric lives up there.

228
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,590
I know him.
He owes me some money.

229
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,393
Then some people
are meeting up at a bar. Okay?

230
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,664
What?

231
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,570
Okay, I'll have three beers.

232
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,639
Four if they're lights.

233
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,444
I mean, you guys really think
I want another DWI?

234
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,046
I should hope not. Well, just...

235
00:15:48,048 --> 00:15:50,415
Call... Just call, you hear?

236
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,450
I know.

237
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,718
Sure, Mom.

238
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,453
Hey, what about me?

239
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:56,454
What about you?

240
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,424
I have to hold back.

241
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,459
I just wanna bite him.

242
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,605
<i>Not here, leave a message.</i>

243
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:49,674
Eric, pick up!

244
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:54,645
You know what?

245
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:56,014
You know what, man?

246
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,049
I mean, I'd call you
a loser and a liar,

247
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:00,385
but I think you know
what a piece of shit you are.

248
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:03,154
I mean, you-you... You can't even
pay me what you owe me.

249
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,589
You know, what kind of fuckin'
man does that make you?

250
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:06,591
So you know what...? By the way,

251
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:08,874
I'm at the bar here by myself,
you fuckin' asshole.

252
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,937
Excuse me. Sorry.

253
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,660
Why are you so sad?

254
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:08,419
I'm not sad.

255
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:12,657
I'm Cara, with a "C".

256
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:19,130
I'm Kevin, with a "K".

257
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:26,571
You want to play some pool?

258
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:30,208
No, I'm no good at pool.

259
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,278
Plus, if I lost,
I'd feel really stupid.

260
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,782
Well, what if I let you win?

261
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,589
You got a girlfriend?

262
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:48,860
You know, that's
the second time

263
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,629
someone's asked me
that question today.

264
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,898
No, no, I don't.

265
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,267
Do you have a girlfriend?

266
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,570
No.

267
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,012
I don't have
a boyfriend either.

268
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,680
I-I need to... I need to go.

269
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:14,485
Oh, wait. Wait, um.

270
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,154
Here.

271
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,564
Promise you'll call?

272
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:31,702
Yeah, I promise.

273
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:34,305
Okay.

274
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:33,898
¶ All right ¶

275
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,633
¶ And it's believin' ¶

276
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,602
¶ Don't be shy ¶

277
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:38,803
¶ You know me ¶

278
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:41,639
¶ I'm on your side ¶

279
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,307
¶ Public deceiver ¶

280
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,642
¶ Take a hike ¶

281
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,811
¶ We don't want you
or your lies ¶

282
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,354
Shit. Oh, shit.

283
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:34,592
Thomas, honey, get the phone.

284
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:42,033
Hello? Yes, this is he.

285
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:44,702
Who is it?

286
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:46,904
Which hospital?

287
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:50,608
Thomas? What?

288
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,712
I don't understand.
What press release?

289
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,649
Well, what can you tell me?

290
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,052
Kevin! Kevin!

291
00:22:01,054 --> 00:22:02,053
Beverly?

292
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:04,855
Thomas, he's not here.

293
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,842
Anybody get hurt today, Grace?

294
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,478
You have an appointment
with the Thackers.

295
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,713
I'm sorry, who?

296
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:30,881
Thomas and Beverly Thacker
at 10:30.

297
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,550
Thackers. Thank you.

298
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,466
Thomas and Beverly.

299
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,403
Hello. Hi, Beverly.

300
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,472
Oh, you're so young. Oh.

301
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:55,673
Thomas.

302
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:56,974
Mr. Pepper. Hi, there.

303
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:57,975
Please, have a seat.

304
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,497
Call me Stu. Thanks, Grace.

305
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:08,853
So how can I help you?

306
00:23:08,855 --> 00:23:11,522
Well, you're
a civil lawyer, right?

307
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14,425
You defended that fella

308
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:17,595
who allegedly was hit
by a police officer?

309
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,663
Yes, I work in personal injury.

310
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,098
But you lost the case? Thomas.

311
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,936
No, to be honest, yes, I did.

312
00:23:25,938 --> 00:23:27,858
It's not something
I am proud of.

313
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:35,413
Well, um, our son was arrested a
few months ago for drunk driving

314
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:36,981
by the Marshalltown police.

315
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,015
How old is he?

316
00:23:38,017 --> 00:23:41,952
He was 21.

317
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:46,657
And they took him to
Marshalltown Police Department,

318
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:49,927
and they were booking him,

319
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,530
and supposedly
he tried to escape custody.

320
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:55,433
How drunk was he?

321
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:56,434
Very.

322
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:59,103
Point two blood-alcohol. Yes.

323
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:03,541
They say that he ran up the
stairs, and up to the roof of

324
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:05,609
that building, and then
jumped from that building

325
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:07,645
to the building next to it,

326
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:11,515
12 feet across
and then fell 20 feet.

327
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:14,518
Excuse me, I am sorry.

328
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,655
Drunk, he did all this?

329
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,490
That's what they say, yes.

330
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:22,793
That night they flew him...
They airlifted him

331
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,795
to a Des Moines hospital.

332
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:27,965
The police report
said that it was just

333
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,768
a hair-line fracture
on the side of his head.

334
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:47,651
Um, Kevin has sustained a rather
severe injury to his brain,

335
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,820
due to his skull fracture.

336
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:54,792
But it's still just one injury.
That's good, right?

337
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:58,929
Kevin's in a coma,

338
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:01,212
and his chances of survival
are very low.

339
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,838
Survival?

340
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,775
Well, you said he just had
a hairline fracture.

341
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,946
In my opinion,
his injuries are not consistent

342
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:19,683
with the police report.

343
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,886
I'm very sorry.

344
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,828
My wife had to make a decision

345
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,270
that no mother
should have to make.

346
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,036
Eventually, we had to
take him off life support.

347
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,873
Now, my father
was a Des Moines police officer,

348
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,976
and we have a lot of respect
for the badge.

349
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:50,247
But with those doctor reports
and that hospital report.

350
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:52,983
We can't help but feel

351
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:57,154
that the Marshalltown Police
killed our son.

352
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:12,102
Why do you think
the Thackers chose you?

353
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:15,072
Maybe there isn't
much of a case.

354
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:19,143
The kid was drunk;
He made some bad decisions.

355
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:20,878
You think
you were their last resource?

356
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,946
Maybe.

357
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,009
It's not like
I got a good track record

358
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:28,035
fighting the cops.

359
00:26:28,036 --> 00:26:30,036
You might surprise yourself
this time.

360
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,690
Wait a minute.

361
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:34,612
You think
I should take this case?

362
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:38,662
I mean, it could be
an opportunity

363
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:40,598
for you to learn
from your mistakes.

364
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,733
Monica, I make a lot of them.

365
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:47,171
There won't be concessions
on either side.

366
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,674
The defense
works for the police;

367
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:52,076
Insurance company pays for it.

368
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:53,911
So, what?
What are you getting at?

369
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:55,312
They never lose.

370
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:57,681
I've known you
for two years now,

371
00:26:57,683 --> 00:27:00,243
and I've never seen you scared.

372
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:05,022
Whatever happened
to the worker's comp stuff?

373
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:09,026
Bad backs, Spinal cord injuries,
broken legs.

374
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:10,728
That stuff is easier.

375
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,696
Then don't do it.

376
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,898
Probably not worth it.

377
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:20,904
I'm gonna bribe you.

378
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:26,944
What do you really think?

379
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:28,379
I think,

380
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:32,116
you either go balls out,
or you scrap it.

381
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:34,785
But I think you need
to make a decision right now!

382
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:37,321
Is this about you,

383
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:41,091
or about the kid
that was killed?

384
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:43,327
I want my penny back.

385
00:27:57,877 --> 00:27:59,309
Honey, I'm trying to work.

386
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,445
What?

387
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:05,049
Look, this kid was killed

388
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:07,151
at the Marshalltown
Police Department.

389
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:09,186
They found his body
in the alley.

390
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:11,255
So you think a cop did it?

391
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:13,991
I don't know.

392
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:16,226
I mean, they said he...

393
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,028
They said he tried to escape.

394
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,965
So you would be prosecuting
the whole police department?

395
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:25,035
The worse thing in the world
would be to lose a child, Nancy.

396
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:28,005
Honey, I don't want
to be negative here,

397
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:30,808
but what if
you do all this work,

398
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,043
you go to trial, and you lose?

399
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:36,780
Well,

400
00:28:36,782 --> 00:28:40,818
then we will pack up,

401
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,186
sell one of the cars.

402
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:43,420
We will re-evaluate.

403
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:46,023
We will, I don't know,

404
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:47,191
we'll get a two-bedroom
apartment

405
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:48,826
like we had
after we got married.

406
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,829
Only this time
we have two children to support.

407
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:54,131
All right, Nancy.
I won't take the case, then.

408
00:28:54,133 --> 00:28:57,367
Okay? I'll look
for something more manageable.

409
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:03,774
Okay.

410
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:22,259
Thank you.

411
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,895
I apologize about Beverly.

412
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:28,432
She just went shopping.

413
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:32,369
She's got the clothes bug
the last couple days.

414
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:35,472
I mean, she can spot
a sale like a hawk.

415
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:41,145
Mr. Thacker,
I wanted to talk to you

416
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:43,280
'cause I'm a little concerned.

417
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,381
This is the only house

418
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,550
that Kevin
has ever lived in, you know.

419
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:50,120
A lot of people out there today,
there's just divorces,

420
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:54,024
all kinds of things going on
with kids and families.

421
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:58,829
We worked hard
to keep this together.

422
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:01,965
You religious?

423
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,169
Well, um,

424
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:08,572
I believe in the truth,
wherever that leads you.

425
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:10,507
Socrates is my hero.

426
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:13,544
Socrates? Yeah.

427
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:15,212
You married? Yeah.

428
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:17,047
Kids?

429
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,448
Two boys.

430
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,317
Four and six.

431
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,085
A real handful,
let me tell you.

432
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:29,026
Yeah, Kevin was our youngest.

433
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:32,129
The rest are all married
and have kids of their own.

434
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:40,504
He, uh, he was a surprise.

435
00:30:42,608 --> 00:30:45,442
We didn't expect him.

436
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,477
He used to call me old,

437
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,999
so I made him do
all the yard work.

438
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,583
What line of work are you in?

439
00:30:52,585 --> 00:30:55,586
Hmm?
What line of work are you in?

440
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:59,456
Oh, I'm retired early.

441
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:03,961
I used to do maintenance
at Sears & Roebuck.

442
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:08,365
And some ancillary work at the
Des Moines Police Department.

443
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:15,525
And now I just soak up
my retirement fund.

444
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:18,375
That's a good place to be.

445
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:21,979
Not really.

446
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:30,187
I went down there,

447
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:34,224
the Marshalltown
Police Department,

448
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,159
and I took a look for myself.

449
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:42,032
There's no way any human being
could have made that jump.

450
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:45,002
Kevin could barely stand
on one leg without falling down.

451
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:53,010
Have you seen
his arresting officer? Dodge?

452
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:57,114
How big he is?

453
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:02,653
Sometimes, people just snap.

454
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:05,489
It must've been a struggle.
He got scared.

455
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:07,557
You're damn right
he was scared.

456
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:10,829
I was talking about the cop.

457
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:16,633
I don't care
how you wanna slice the pie.

458
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:19,236
Kevin's dead.

459
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:21,479
And that guy is still out there,
walking around.

460
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:27,751
I want to show you
Kevin's room. Come here.

461
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:34,853
¶

462
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:43,093
The day he died,
Beverly washed all his clothes,

463
00:32:43,095 --> 00:32:47,264
and folded them, and put them
back in his dresser.

464
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:53,036
The Cubs was his favorite team.

465
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:55,339
Ryan Sandberg's a hell
of a second baseman isn't he?

466
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:57,441
We'll see how they do
next year.

467
00:32:57,443 --> 00:33:01,345
Yeah, we sure will.

468
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:03,613
I loved Wrigley Field.

469
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:08,452
I was there for the first time
in 1938.

470
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:10,655
I think they won the pennant
that year.

471
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,726
That was before your time.

472
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:24,501
I want you and another car
to head downtown.

473
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,470
We got a real back-up
on Main Street.

474
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,205
Just push all the traffic
west on Elm.

475
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:29,927
All right? West on Elm.

476
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:39,316
You want me to go downtown,
Chief?

477
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:40,751
John,
I think you're a good cop,

478
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:42,352
but I got this thing
on my plate.

479
00:33:42,354 --> 00:33:44,187
Seems we're being sued
by the Kevin Thacker estate.

480
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,556
Seems like some people
got the wrong idea

481
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,492
about what happened that night.

482
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:52,229
He should've ran the other way.

483
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,663
You know, he told me
he was gonna end it.

484
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,665
End what?
When I was booking him,

485
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,734
he said
"I might was well end it now."

486
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:59,669
And that's in the report?

487
00:33:59,671 --> 00:34:02,072
No.

488
00:34:02,074 --> 00:34:04,741
Ron, your stories match, right?

489
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:08,545
We did everything that we could.
Followed procedure.

490
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:12,049
Prisoner escaped;
Officer Dodge sounded the alarm.

491
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:13,350
We had no idea
where the kid was.

492
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:14,751
Yeah, I even
drove the ambulance.

493
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,353
You know, next time,
you just stay at the station.

494
00:34:16,355 --> 00:34:18,221
He was dying. The guys
needed to be with him.

495
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,290
I figure I should drive.

496
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,093
All right.

497
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:25,128
The lawyer's coming
tomorrow morning.

498
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,496
As long as they treat us
with respect,

499
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:28,331
there's gonna be no problem.

500
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,200
We were trying
to save the kid's life.

501
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:32,202
Well, yeah, the FBI
is gonna be involved,

502
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:34,271
so just making sure
that your bases are all covered.

503
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:36,740
Fine, they'll understand
how thorough I was.

504
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:39,309
I took the pictures;
I gathered the evidence.

505
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:42,212
Well, if you're good, I'm good.

506
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:44,781
Yeah, well, to be honest with
you, I thought this was done.

507
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:47,117
Right, okay.

508
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:53,590
Ron?

509
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:56,359
Yeah, give me a minute.

510
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:05,635
<i>I want you to put your arms</i>
<i>out like this,</i>

511
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:07,988
<i>I want you</i>
<i>to put your head back,</i>

512
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:10,429
<i>and with your index finger,</i>
<i>I want you to touch your nose.</i>

513
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,846
<i>Do it with each side.</i>

514
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:21,818
<i>Now get your hands</i>
<i>out of your pockets.</i>

515
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:26,490
<i>If it is your second DWI,</i>

516
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,626
<i>your license will be suspended</i>
<i>for up to a year.</i>

517
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:32,195
I'm, I-I'm gonna...

518
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:33,196
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

519
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:34,197
You gotta go to the bathroom?

520
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,199
Yeah. You gonna get sick?

521
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,666
Nope. All right.

522
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:58,288
So I guess you took the case?

523
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,393
Yeah.

524
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:05,462
Even after all we talked about?

525
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:10,333
I had to.

526
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:26,683
On the tape, Kevin asks
to use the bathroom at 1:15 a.m.

527
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,553
He's in the bathroom
for about two minutes.

528
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:31,488
How do you know that?

529
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,291
Well, because Dodge thinks
Kevin is coming back into

530
00:36:34,293 --> 00:36:35,725
the interrogation room,

531
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:37,627
so he turns the camera back on.

532
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:41,264
Now Kevin doesn't come back,
so Dodge starts to panic,

533
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:44,267
he goes to search for Kevin,
and the tape is left on

534
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:46,570
for an additional
minute and 15 seconds,

535
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:49,206
then it's turned
back off again.

536
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,908
So it sounds like we have
a missing minute and 15 seconds.

537
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,411
Right, but Dodge claimed
he found Kevin unconscious

538
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:58,448
at 1:24 a.m., that gives us
a missing eight minutes.

539
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:02,385
That's enough time to stage a
fall; Do a cover-up.

540
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:04,921
That's also enough time to climb
the roof and make the jump.

541
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,423
Well, we're about to see

542
00:37:06,425 --> 00:37:08,626
how possible that really is,
aren't we?

543
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:28,912
I'm the angel on your shoulder.

544
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,715
You're an angel, huh?

545
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:33,783
I have big fuckin' angel wings.

546
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:38,421
I could have made that jump.

547
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:43,927
I still got his blood
on my uniform.

548
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,730
Didn't wash out.

549
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:48,498
So much blood
came out of his head.

550
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,936
Hey, you're acting like
you've never seen blood before.

551
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:56,039
Now listen, in the future,
you follow the prisoner;

552
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,374
The prisoner
doesn't follow you.

553
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,376
You're right. It was a mistake.

554
00:37:59,378 --> 00:38:00,910
Then why are you looking
so fucking scared?

555
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,646
I don't look fucking scared.

556
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:06,850
I think you got on a lot of
faces, but never the right one.

557
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:12,656
You're a cop; Look like a cop.

558
00:38:26,438 --> 00:38:27,737
Captain.

559
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:31,074
Mr. Pepper. I'm Chief Wilson.

560
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:32,509
Stu.

561
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,943
This is Greg Potter,
he's our city attorney.

562
00:38:33,945 --> 00:38:35,312
Greg. Stu Pepper.

563
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,680
This is Monica Wright,
an associate of mine.

564
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:38,048
Pleasure, ma'am.
How can we help you folks?

565
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,383
Just wanted to take a look
at that roof;

566
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:41,918
Maybe take some pictures.

567
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,386
Hope you didn't think
you were going to take

568
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,988
any depositions today.

569
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,357
No. No.

570
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:50,427
Just wanted to know
the right questions to ask.

571
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,733
According to their version,

572
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:58,802
the two officers
searched the basement,

573
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:01,244
then the upper floors,
but they never came up here.

574
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:17,387
So he walked across here,
no running start,

575
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,589
and jumped over
to the other building?

576
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:28,398
That's a really long jump.

577
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,734
That's very, very far.

578
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,370
But he does however

579
00:39:33,372 --> 00:39:35,538
drop the cigarette
and lighter over there.

580
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,906
Why didn't they just say
that he fell?

581
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,609
I mean, I don't get it.

582
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:41,611
Injuries aside,
we have to prove

583
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:44,881
that Kevin was never
on that other building.

584
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,126
Where are you going? Hmm?

585
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:31,694
I was just getting started.

586
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,530
Oh, you.

587
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,956
<i>Our greatest hope</i>
<i>for the future</i>

588
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,691
<i>are the minds and hearts</i>
<i>of our people,</i>

589
00:41:01,693 --> 00:41:03,760
<i>especially our children.</i>

590
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:06,129
<i>We can help them build tomorrow</i>

591
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,566
<i>by strengthening our</i>
<i>community of shared values.</i>

592
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:12,202
<i>Values that help bring us</i>
<i>together as one people,</i>

593
00:41:12,204 --> 00:41:15,638
<i>from the youngest child</i>
<i>to the most senior citizen.</i>

594
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,742
<i>For us, faith, work, family,</i>
<i>neighborhood, freedom...</i>

595
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:21,177
Oh, there he is.

596
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,395
Mr. Pepper.

597
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,612
Congratulations
on your appointment.

598
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:24,948
I appreciate that,
I appreciate that.

599
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,149
Come on back.

600
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:31,955
Yeah, it is finally
our turn again.

601
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:33,590
We're excited.

602
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:36,826
Did you see Reagan's
State of the Union address

603
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:38,695
the other night?

604
00:41:38,697 --> 00:41:41,231
"America, in the crimson light
of a rising sun,

605
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:45,001
fresh from the burning,
creative hand of God."

606
00:41:46,538 --> 00:41:48,171
I guess we watched
the same show.

607
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:50,240
I helped write it.

608
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:57,981
Well, you're aware of my suit
against the Marshalltown PD?

609
00:41:57,983 --> 00:41:59,716
I sure am, my friend.

610
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:02,552
I wanted to give you
a heads up on that.

611
00:42:02,554 --> 00:42:04,654
I'm filing 15 counts,

612
00:42:04,656 --> 00:42:06,689
and when I get
the Thackers their judgment,

613
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,658
I would hope that your
department would want to follow

614
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,560
through on the prosecution
of the men responsible.

615
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:12,896
I'll do what's best
for my department.

616
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:17,567
You do plan on
investigating the case?

617
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:20,270
We'll take a look at the case;
We will proceed from there.

618
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,607
Do the family a favor,

619
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:27,977
have out of town agents
do the investigation.

620
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:30,914
Don't want to risk a connection
with the local cops and

621
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,582
conflict of interests.

622
00:42:32,584 --> 00:42:36,586
Sounds like you've been
bitten in the ass before, huh?

623
00:42:36,588 --> 00:42:40,757
Yeah, that's why
I wanted to come talk to you.

624
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:43,126
You're the assistant
to the Attorney General,

625
00:42:43,128 --> 00:42:46,696
and this is going to be
a high-profile case.

626
00:42:46,698 --> 00:42:49,599
You know, maybe
they'll put you on TV, huh?

627
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:51,521
Be good for your practice,
right?

628
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:56,072
Sure would.

629
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,207
Let me know when you assign
an agent to the case.

630
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:01,644
Well, Mr. Pepper, are you asking
me or are you telling me?

631
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,683
Whichever answer keeps
this conversation going.

632
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:09,986
Well, I think you're asking,
so it's noted.

633
00:43:09,988 --> 00:43:12,055
Good luck with your case, huh?

634
00:43:19,297 --> 00:43:21,998
<i>The only good is knowledge</i>

635
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,935
<i>and the only evil is ignorance.</i>

636
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,838
<i>I wanted to understand</i>
<i>Kevin Thacker,</i>

637
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,340
<i>talk to him,</i>

638
00:43:30,342 --> 00:43:33,242
<i>but the light ahead</i>
<i>was beginning to fade.</i>

639
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:35,378
<i>My own life out of balance,</i>

640
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,147
<i>looking for a truth</i>
<i>while everyone else</i>

641
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:40,950
<i>turned a deaf ear</i>
<i>and a blind eye.</i>

642
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:42,285
<i>Just trying to keep</i>
<i>my head above water</i>

643
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,320
<i>was proving</i>
<i>more and more difficult.</i>

644
00:43:45,724 --> 00:43:47,624
All right, gentlemen,
listen up.

645
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:49,192
Any of you guys
think you can jump

646
00:43:49,194 --> 00:43:53,730
from the end of the starting
block to that rope

647
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:57,133
without a running start?

648
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,935
Sure.

649
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:01,404
I took track and field
in high school.

650
00:44:01,406 --> 00:44:02,739
Yeah?

651
00:44:02,741 --> 00:44:03,906
What do I get if I make it?

652
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:06,175
You get the Dean's list,
O'Brien.

653
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,144
You're up, let's go.

654
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,347
And don't laugh,
all of you gonna get your shot.

655
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:17,247
Don't mess up! Don't mess up!

656
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,994
Yeah, let's see
if you can do it.

657
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,062
Zach.

658
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,901
You guys, come on.

659
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:44,297
So how do you think they'd do

660
00:44:44,298 --> 00:44:46,248
with a belly full of beer and
a Police Officer on their tail?

661
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:47,531
No way.

662
00:44:50,922 --> 00:44:53,289
Marshalltown PD's whole defense

663
00:44:53,291 --> 00:44:55,892
hinges on this jump, Monica.

664
00:44:55,894 --> 00:44:57,260
Put the swim coach
on the stand.

665
00:44:57,262 --> 00:45:00,830
The field test
obviously speaks for itself.

666
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:03,066
The state medical examiner
said Kevin's body

667
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:07,737
had no other injuries
besides the trauma to the brain.

668
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:10,139
And not even a low board diver
can make that jump.

669
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:12,375
Much less Kevin Thacker.

670
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:15,712
Right, but Kevin obviously did

671
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:17,380
because of
the menthol cigarette.

672
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:20,016
That was planted. Exactly.

673
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:25,421
Okay... Okay, so what
do we have, then?

674
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:28,157
Well, that gives us the power
to convince a jury that: A,

675
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:31,828
Kevin could never
have made that jump; And B,

676
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:35,031
his injuries don't reflect
a fall of 24 feet.

677
00:45:35,033 --> 00:45:38,501
He was killed by blunt force.

678
00:45:38,503 --> 00:45:41,738
Kevin was drunk.
One officer found the body.

679
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,140
And they were in the
perfect position for a cover-up.

680
00:45:44,142 --> 00:45:47,410
Yes. Monica, yes.

681
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:48,945
All right, let's
go through this again.

682
00:45:48,947 --> 00:45:50,947
What do we have?
Oh, we got a lot.

683
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:53,216
Somehow, Kevin's body ends up
parallel to the building.

684
00:45:53,218 --> 00:45:54,517
In order to stage the fall.

685
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:55,918
Dodge had to have
moved the body,

686
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,420
because of the bruises
under the arm pits.

687
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,877
Hey, Nance!

688
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:27,817
Bert? Clark?

689
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:41,931
Hey.

690
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:45,535
Where are the kids?

691
00:46:45,537 --> 00:46:47,170
They're at my mother's.

692
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:50,506
You took them
all the way to your mother's?

693
00:46:53,278 --> 00:46:54,911
God, I was in a good mood,

694
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:55,912
I wanted to share that
with my family,

695
00:46:55,914 --> 00:46:58,214
and I get an empty house.

696
00:46:58,216 --> 00:47:00,983
I wanted to spend
some time with you alone.

697
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,465
You haven't exactly
been available.

698
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:06,956
Clark has a birthday coming up,
or did you forget?

699
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:14,063
I bust my ass,
trying to make a living for you,

700
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:15,431
trying to do what's right.

701
00:47:15,433 --> 00:47:17,433
That's a lawyer, Stu,
not a husband.

702
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:21,070
You know, some people
might disagree with you.

703
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:25,107
What do I get?
I get an empty fucking house!

704
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:26,542
What the hell are you doing?

705
00:47:26,544 --> 00:47:29,245
Dammit. I am trying
to get this thing open.

706
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:34,016
Jesus Christ.

707
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:38,888
Fuck.

708
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:09,652
Nancy, I'm sorry.

709
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:09,011
Why did you arrest
Kevin Thacker?

710
00:49:09,013 --> 00:49:10,646
He was swerving on the road.

711
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:12,581
I witnessed him
almost hit a parked vehicle.

712
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:16,252
He was pretty drunk,
so it was a good arrest.

713
00:49:16,254 --> 00:49:18,087
What does a "good arrest" mean?

714
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:20,056
It means
that you follow protocol.

715
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:23,459
So, how did he act when you
took him into the station?

716
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,461
He was nervous.

717
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,196
Most are at that age.

718
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:28,731
No screaming? No crying?

719
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:31,734
None at all.

720
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:36,038
If everything
followed protocol,

721
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,673
how did it result in his death?

722
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,643
That's a good question.

723
00:49:40,645 --> 00:49:42,578
Because you must have dealt
with criminals

724
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,546
much worse than Kevin.

725
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:45,748
Sure, I have.

726
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:48,484
Oh, and by the way, there was
a warrant out for his arrest

727
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,553
when I ran his license.

728
00:49:52,357 --> 00:49:53,522
For what?

729
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:54,757
He didn't make a court date

730
00:49:54,759 --> 00:49:56,425
two weeks prior
to the incident.

731
00:49:56,427 --> 00:49:58,995
It was a speeding violation.

732
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:03,366
And I treated him
like any other offender.

733
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:06,502
But you were the last person
to see him alive.

734
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:09,338
The only mistake I made

735
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,608
was to give him more credit
that he deserved.

736
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,044
He was no criminal.

737
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:17,413
I really thought he was going
to walk back into the room,

738
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:19,615
but he didn't.

739
00:50:19,617 --> 00:50:22,051
I found him unconscious
seven minutes later.

740
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:24,687
How am I supposed to
be held liable for that?

741
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,722
When dispatch called you,
you didn't pick up your radio.

742
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:28,290
Is that correct.

743
00:50:29,293 --> 00:50:30,326
How do you know that?

744
00:50:30,328 --> 00:50:33,295
Oh, I've got the logs.

745
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:36,766
Well, there was too much
interference in the building.

746
00:50:36,768 --> 00:50:38,200
Interference.

747
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:41,137
Yeah, too much interference
in the building.

748
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:46,609
So, did you interview all
the relevant witnesses

749
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:47,610
and people involved?

750
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:49,678
Yes, I did.

751
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:54,650
So, it was your claim that Kevin
walked to the end of that beam

752
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:58,220
and jumped from
one rooftop to the next?

753
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:00,456
That distance; That drunk.

754
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:03,092
People do stupid things.

755
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:04,326
Look,
the long and short of it is

756
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:05,795
I did a thorough investigation,

757
00:51:05,797 --> 00:51:07,663
and everyone behaved
professionally and promptly.

758
00:51:07,665 --> 00:51:09,498
From the behavior
of your department,

759
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,599
I find that hard to believe.

760
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:12,435
We have already acknowledged

761
00:51:12,437 --> 00:51:15,271
that certain procedural
mistakes were made.

762
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:18,174
Yeah, and if this is about
questioning my skills

763
00:51:18,176 --> 00:51:19,341
as a detective, quite frankly,

764
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:21,510
you have no idea
what that entails.

765
00:51:21,512 --> 00:51:23,145
What do you have to gain
from this case?

766
00:51:23,147 --> 00:51:24,747
What do you have to gain?

767
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:26,415
Why don't you let me
ask the questions.

768
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,416
Besides money?

769
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,152
Reputation. Justice.

770
00:51:30,154 --> 00:51:33,489
Look, just because you keep
a clean image, Mr. Pebble,

771
00:51:33,491 --> 00:51:35,458
it doesn't mean
you're above the law.

772
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,560
You're putting on an act, sir,
and I think you enjoy it.

773
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:38,928
Counselor.

774
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,295
Do you know anything
about this kid.

775
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:43,799
Did you speak to his boyfriend?

776
00:51:45,236 --> 00:51:46,235
I'm sorry?

777
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:47,838
Eric Jones. I did.

778
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:52,274
Kevin went to visit him
that night.

779
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,210
It was a closeted relationship.

780
00:51:54,212 --> 00:51:56,879
They weren't like
flaming fags or anything.

781
00:51:56,881 --> 00:51:59,248
But he was quite a character.

782
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,884
Now, Eric told me
that Kevin was depressed,

783
00:52:01,886 --> 00:52:04,487
and had a drinking problem.

784
00:52:04,489 --> 00:52:06,856
And Officer Dodge said that
the kid said he wanted to end it

785
00:52:06,858 --> 00:52:08,757
during the DUI processing.

786
00:52:08,759 --> 00:52:11,560
So when you're in that state
of mind, anything can happen.

787
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:16,599
Hey. All right, do me a favor,

788
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:18,300
find out
where Eric Jones lives.

789
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:19,902
Yeah. Who's our judge?

790
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:22,605
Hallow, he used to be
City Attorney.

791
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,925
Hello?

792
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:44,727
Hello?

793
00:52:44,729 --> 00:52:45,794
Eric?

794
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:51,554
I'm the lawyer in
the Thacker case.

795
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:56,438
Did you know Kevin Thacker?

796
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,175
You know, I'm having
a party with myself right now,

797
00:52:59,177 --> 00:53:01,343
and you two, you're just...
You're not invited, okay?

798
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:04,180
Hey, hey, listen,
we can do this two ways.

799
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:06,199
You can talk to me now,

800
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:07,483
or I can have you
officially deposed;

801
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:09,351
We'll do it
at the police station.

802
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:13,222
I already talked to the cops.

803
00:53:13,224 --> 00:53:14,356
Marshalltown cops?

804
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,225
No, Columbo.

805
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:18,627
Eric, just a couple of minutes?

806
00:53:18,629 --> 00:53:20,262
Please.

807
00:53:21,465 --> 00:53:23,905
All right, fine. Back here.

808
00:53:27,638 --> 00:53:31,740
So all they told me
is that he was arrested drunk

809
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:34,443
and fell off the roof.

810
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:40,216
I mean, I didn't push him or
nothing, I swear to God.

811
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:42,785
Yeah, but

812
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:46,655
he came to Marshalltown
to see you, right?

813
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:48,257
I mean, that's why he was here.

814
00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:50,793
He came here first.

815
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:52,728
How do you know that?

816
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,662
Well, 'cause I talked to the
same cop as you,

817
00:53:54,665 --> 00:53:55,764
Columbo.

818
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:00,636
I owed him some money.

819
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:03,572
He was kind of an impatient
little guy, you know.

820
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,752
I want my fucking money, Eric!

821
00:54:12,883 --> 00:54:15,484
Kevin, God rest his soul
and all,

822
00:54:15,486 --> 00:54:17,486
he's what you'd call
unpredictable.

823
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:19,455
How's that?

824
00:54:19,457 --> 00:54:21,657
You never knew
what he was gonna do.

825
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:24,293
Like try to escape
from the police?

826
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:26,862
Yeah. That sounds
a lot like him.

827
00:54:26,864 --> 00:54:29,431
I suppose if you were
asked that same question

828
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:32,835
in a deposition or in a court,
you'd have the same answer.

829
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:35,738
Might be worse, actually.

830
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:40,309
Are you hiding something Eric?

831
00:54:40,311 --> 00:54:42,311
I'm not hiding anything, okay?

832
00:54:42,313 --> 00:54:44,046
I mean, I tried
to take care of him, you know?

833
00:54:44,048 --> 00:54:47,283
He would come over here,
he'd spend the night,

834
00:54:47,285 --> 00:54:49,985
the kid would flip out
all night long, crying and shit.

835
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:55,924
I think he was very scared
about who he really was.

836
00:55:00,531 --> 00:55:02,565
He must have been terrified

837
00:55:02,566 --> 00:55:05,046
sitting in that interrogation
room, I'll tell you that.

838
00:55:10,775 --> 00:55:12,841
When he died,

839
00:55:14,812 --> 00:55:18,447
I couldn't go to the funeral.

840
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:20,883
I didn't want to see
his parents.

841
00:55:24,055 --> 00:55:27,206
You know, Kevin,

842
00:55:27,207 --> 00:55:30,358
he wouldn't have wanted me
there anyways, you know.

843
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:32,428
So, that's all
I am going to say.

844
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,470
You want any more,
you gotta expose me.

845
00:55:35,766 --> 00:55:37,099
Depose you.

846
00:55:38,369 --> 00:55:39,368
Shall we?

847
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:40,869
Yeah.

848
00:55:43,808 --> 00:55:44,807
He had a gold leaf on them.

849
00:55:44,809 --> 00:55:45,808
I know.

850
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:47,810
Come!

851
00:55:47,812 --> 00:55:48,977
Judge Hallow?

852
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:49,978
Yes?

853
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:50,979
Stu Pepper, Your Honor.

854
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:51,980
The lawyer in the Thacker case.

855
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:54,116
Oh.

856
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:55,851
Greg.

857
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,453
You're here on Officer Dodge's
motion for summary judgment.

858
00:55:57,455 --> 00:55:58,954
I am.

859
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:01,590
Fifteen counts, Mr. Pepper.
Very ambitious.

860
00:56:01,592 --> 00:56:03,058
It is.

861
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,861
Your Honor, I move
for dismissal of all counts.

862
00:56:07,431 --> 00:56:09,031
I'm throwing out
14 of the counts.

863
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:10,532
Why?

864
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:13,435
Insufficient evidence.

865
00:56:13,437 --> 00:56:14,570
It's all circumstantial.

866
00:56:14,572 --> 00:56:16,532
Didn't you learn that
in law school?

867
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:21,443
You're throwing out
14 out of 15 counts?

868
00:56:21,445 --> 00:56:23,679
Okay.
What count are you keeping?

869
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:26,115
"Excessive force." Barely.

870
00:56:26,117 --> 00:56:27,950
Your Honor, can I be frank?

871
00:56:27,952 --> 00:56:29,418
If you must.

872
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,487
You used to be
city attorney, correct?

873
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:34,523
You used to be him:
Defending these guys.

874
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:38,427
Is there any chance this could
be a conflict of interest?

875
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:45,667
Are you hinting I may not be

876
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:47,636
fair and impartial, Mr. Pepper?

877
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,573
You've got a case to prepare,

878
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:53,792
and people to answer to.

879
00:56:53,793 --> 00:56:56,010
Exactly how smart is it to piss
off the judge before the trial?

880
00:56:56,013 --> 00:56:59,081
I'm not trying to piss you off.

881
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:02,117
And I'll take your one count
of excessive force,

882
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,953
because that's all I need
to win the case.

883
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:07,589
Thank you, gentlemen.
I will see you both in court.

884
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:14,863
But don't worry
about it getting dirty.

885
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:17,132
I have to take things to the
cleaners every once in awhile.

886
00:57:17,134 --> 00:57:19,201
I like your scarf too.

887
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:28,477
Why aren't you sleeping?

888
00:57:31,715 --> 00:57:33,782
I don't know.

889
00:57:37,555 --> 00:57:41,623
Nance, um,
I'm not sure what to do.

890
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:49,665
I got an FBI director
that could care less,

891
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:52,868
got a judge that throws out
95% of my counts.

892
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:57,172
Same judge who used to make
his living defending cops.

893
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:01,710
Baby, I'm so sorry.

894
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:08,951
I just want you to be careful.

895
00:58:08,953 --> 00:58:13,055
Think about what it means
to prosecute cop after cop.

896
00:58:13,057 --> 00:58:16,925
Stu, these people
can make our lives miserable.

897
00:58:16,927 --> 00:58:21,196
Yeah, but they're already
making peoples' lives miserable.

898
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:26,168
Somebody's gotta take a stand.

899
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:30,119
You don't have to
do it tonight.

900
00:58:33,143 --> 00:58:35,244
Come on, let's go to bed.

901
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,288
<i>All right, break it up.</i>

902
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:47,956
<i>Break it up, I said.</i>

903
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:21,857
<i>An honest man</i>
<i>is always a child.</i>

904
00:59:21,859 --> 00:59:24,026
<i>But it's even simpler.</i>

905
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:27,095
<i>What has been lost</i>
<i>and what has been gained?</i>

906
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:30,198
<i>I was close to the Thackers,</i>

907
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,836
<i>seeing my own image</i>
<i>in their loss.</i>

908
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:37,139
<i>I never knew if I was</i>
<i>their last stop on a long list</i>

909
00:59:37,141 --> 00:59:40,275
<i>that I just happened to be</i>
<i>at the bottom of.</i>

910
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:43,712
<i>I was learning that</i>
<i>the self-doubt, the anxiety,</i>

911
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:46,682
<i>sleepless nights,</i>
<i>time away from my own family</i>

912
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:51,587
<i>was to be expected</i>
<i>if I was going to succeed.</i>

913
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:53,255
<i>I had become close</i>
<i>to a young man</i>

914
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:56,158
<i>who I have never had</i>
<i>the opportunity to meet.</i>

915
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,660
<i>His justice</i>
<i>rests on my shoulders.</i>

916
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:05,867
<i>I can't raise the dead,</i>
<i>but I have to speak for them.</i>

917
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:34,329
Jury members,
you are being asked to decide

918
01:00:34,331 --> 01:00:36,965
whether excessive force
was used

919
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:39,368
during the arrest
of Kevin Thacker.

920
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:41,370
The city attorneys
will attempt to prove

921
01:00:41,372 --> 01:00:44,740
that Mr. Thacker escaped custody
during his booking,

922
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:48,810
and died accidentally
during this getaway.

923
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:51,947
The attorneys for the Thackers
will attempt to prove

924
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:53,682
that the head trauma
he incurred

925
01:00:53,684 --> 01:00:57,252
could not have happened
the way it was reported.

926
01:00:57,254 --> 01:01:01,423
It is your charge to determine
what you believe the truth is.

927
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:29,418
Mr. Pepper, please call
your first witness.

928
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,888
Your Honor, I would like
to call Officer John Dodge.

929
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:38,160
Officer Dodge,

930
01:01:38,162 --> 01:01:41,430
let me start out by asking
a very simple question.

931
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:47,369
Go ahead.

932
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,004
Do you normally
brush your teeth

933
01:01:49,006 --> 01:01:50,966
before you go to work
in the morning?

934
01:01:51,408 --> 01:01:52,874
Yes.

935
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:57,292
And have you ever
killed anyone?

936
01:02:01,018 --> 01:02:02,284
Yes, I have.

937
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:05,887
I was in
the 25th Infantry division

938
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:09,191
at Cu Chi and Dau Tieng,
Vietnam.

939
01:02:09,193 --> 01:02:12,260
And in what manner

940
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:15,363
did you perform
these killings in Vietnam?

941
01:02:16,467 --> 01:02:20,168
With my rifle.
Sometimes my bayonet.

942
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:22,204
All in self-defense.

943
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,943
Just to be clear for the Jury.

944
01:02:27,945 --> 01:02:29,111
Self-defense?

945
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:31,012
I learned to make
quick decisions

946
01:02:31,014 --> 01:02:32,280
in delicate situations.

947
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:34,382
I guess that's why
I became a cop.

948
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:37,819
Quick decisions
in delicate situations.

949
01:02:37,821 --> 01:02:39,888
Hmm.

950
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:41,022
What's your height and weight?

951
01:02:41,024 --> 01:02:43,925
6'1", 210 pounds.

952
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:48,764
And Kevin Thacker was 5'7",
133 pounds.

953
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:52,000
That's quite a difference,
isn't it?

954
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:54,402
Well, I'm bigger
than most people,

955
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:56,538
so it's no surprise to me.

956
01:02:56,540 --> 01:03:00,275
On the night
of October 29th, 1983,

957
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:02,878
did a struggle occur
in the alleyway

958
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,479
behind the Marshalltown
Police Department,

959
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:06,281
between yourself
and Kevin Thacker?

960
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:07,549
No, it did not.

961
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:09,050
And during that struggle,

962
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:11,887
being a man
of your size and experience,

963
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:14,222
you struck Kevin on the left
side of the head killing him.

964
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:16,258
Is that correct?

965
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,460
No, I did not.

966
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,663
I was simply trying to find
an escaped prisoner.

967
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:31,373
Prisoner is loose
in the building.

968
01:03:44,488 --> 01:03:46,555
Shit.

969
01:03:59,236 --> 01:04:00,936
Shit.

970
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,307
Call an ambulance.

971
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:18,286
From the time that Kevin
asked to use the bathroom,

972
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:21,289
to the time that
you found him unconscious,

973
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:25,460
that was approximately
seven minutes, correct?

974
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:27,195
Yes, that's right.

975
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:28,929
He was in the bathroom
for just under two minutes,

976
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:31,032
and we were walking out.

977
01:04:31,034 --> 01:04:33,568
I went to turn
the video camera back on,

978
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:36,538
and then I realized
that he had fled.

979
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,774
After a search,

980
01:04:38,775 --> 01:04:41,009
I came back a minute later
to turn the camera off,

981
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:45,180
and with the assistance of other
officers, did another search.

982
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:47,916
Well, why bother
to come all the way back

983
01:04:47,918 --> 01:04:49,451
to turn the video camera off?

984
01:04:49,453 --> 01:04:51,119
There was nobody
was in the room.

985
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:52,654
It was an instinct.

986
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:54,188
And we all have
certain instincts

987
01:04:54,191 --> 01:04:57,225
that force us
to do certain things, correct?

988
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,961
Kevin Thacker
would still be alive today

989
01:04:59,963 --> 01:05:03,064
if he would have just
allowed me to do my job.

990
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:06,501
Kevin had to allow you
to do your job?

991
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:11,973
I don't think it's that simple,
Officer Dodge.

992
01:05:14,211 --> 01:05:16,091
No further questions,
Your Honor.

993
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:29,491
Professor Daily,
can you tell the court

994
01:05:29,493 --> 01:05:32,627
what a standing broad jump is?

995
01:05:32,629 --> 01:05:34,562
A standing broad jump
is an event

996
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:37,232
in which the competitor
stands at a line,

997
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:40,068
and from a standing posture,
they jump as far as they can.

998
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:42,237
And what's the world's record
for such a jump?

999
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:45,173
The longest jump
is 12 feet, one inch.

1000
01:05:45,175 --> 01:05:49,177
And do you think anyone,
even a trained athlete,

1001
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:52,080
could make such a jump?

1002
01:05:52,082 --> 01:05:53,315
No.

1003
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:56,151
Have you done any tests
to verify this?

1004
01:05:56,153 --> 01:05:58,119
Yes, I did.

1005
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,522
Several of my swimmers
jumped from a platform

1006
01:06:00,524 --> 01:06:04,159
similar to the one Kevin Thacker
allegedly leaped from.

1007
01:06:04,161 --> 01:06:06,494
Right. What were the results?

1008
01:06:06,496 --> 01:06:09,698
None of them were able
to complete the 12 feet.

1009
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,600
Not even close.

1010
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:15,036
Well, so in light of your test,

1011
01:06:15,038 --> 01:06:17,539
if those athlete's
lives depended

1012
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:19,541
on jumping those 12 feet,

1013
01:06:19,543 --> 01:06:22,110
how many
would still be alive today?

1014
01:06:22,112 --> 01:06:24,679
None of them.

1015
01:06:24,681 --> 01:06:26,721
I mean, unless they had wings,
you know.

1016
01:06:30,454 --> 01:06:32,654
Thank you.

1017
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:33,722
I'm a medical doctor,

1018
01:06:33,724 --> 01:06:35,557
specializing
in forensic pathology.

1019
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:37,726
I've taught the subject
for the past 12 years

1020
01:06:37,728 --> 01:06:39,561
at the Wisconsin State
Medical School,

1021
01:06:39,563 --> 01:06:42,197
and was a coroner
for over 20 years.

1022
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:45,767
No, Kevin Thacker's autopsy
was done by the county coroner.

1023
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:49,738
Mr. Thacker died from a
contrecoup injury to the brain.

1024
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,540
The two types of injuries
are a coup and contrecoup.

1025
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:55,777
Since the brain floats
in the fluid of the skull,

1026
01:06:55,779 --> 01:06:57,612
and is subject to movement,

1027
01:06:57,614 --> 01:07:00,615
in a coup injury,
the skull would hit an object,

1028
01:07:00,617 --> 01:07:04,052
such as a fall, and the brain
hits the side of the skull

1029
01:07:04,054 --> 01:07:05,487
where the impact occurred.

1030
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:09,024
In Kevin's injury,
an object hit the skull,

1031
01:07:09,026 --> 01:07:13,361
not the reverse,
producing a contrecoup injury.

1032
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:16,364
This forces the brain to
the other side of the skull.

1033
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:20,201
In his case: Blunt object
hitting the left temporal bone

1034
01:07:20,203 --> 01:07:23,471
causing bleeding
in the right temporal lobe.

1035
01:07:23,473 --> 01:07:26,241
Doctor, did the autopsy report

1036
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:31,079
reveal any other injuries
to Kevin, at all?

1037
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:33,381
There was bruises
underneath his armpits,

1038
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:36,501
but other than that, no.

1039
01:07:36,502 --> 01:07:39,620
The defense claims that Kevin
died from a fall of 24 feet

1040
01:07:39,623 --> 01:07:42,290
onto an asphalt surface.

1041
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:44,092
Well, bluntly put,

1042
01:07:44,094 --> 01:07:47,762
that would defy both
medical and biological science.

1043
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:49,497
It's outrageous, really.

1044
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:52,667
He would have multiple bruising
where the impact occurred,

1045
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:55,370
other bone fractures,
damages to his organs,

1046
01:07:55,372 --> 01:07:58,807
which Mr. Thacker did not have.

1047
01:07:58,809 --> 01:08:01,076
Thank you, Doctor.

1048
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:15,123
Dr. Booker, how long have you
been a state medical examiner

1049
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:17,759
and what does that job entail?

1050
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,327
Well, I specialize

1051
01:08:19,329 --> 01:08:21,262
in comprehensive
medical examinations,

1052
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:23,098
primarily postmortem.

1053
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:24,599
And for five years,
I've worked as an expert witness

1054
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:26,434
for the police department.

1055
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:30,238
And in your expert opinion,
from what height can a person

1056
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:34,142
hit the ground
without sustaining injury?

1057
01:08:34,144 --> 01:08:36,611
A body can fall
from as high as six stories

1058
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,546
without sustaining injury.

1059
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:41,749
Six stories. Thank you.

1060
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:44,586
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1061
01:08:44,588 --> 01:08:46,654
Cross examine, Mr. Pepper.

1062
01:08:53,897 --> 01:08:58,299
Um, let me get this straight.

1063
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,168
Now, you just testified

1064
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:03,805
that a body can fall
six stories

1065
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:06,241
without sustaining an injury.

1066
01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:07,775
Is that correct?

1067
01:09:07,777 --> 01:09:09,377
Yes, yes.

1068
01:09:09,379 --> 01:09:11,246
If there's an equal,
instantaneous transference

1069
01:09:11,248 --> 01:09:14,616
between the body
and the ground.

1070
01:09:14,618 --> 01:09:15,898
Right.

1071
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:20,555
Well, now what is that?

1072
01:09:20,557 --> 01:09:24,392
Can you demonstrate
that for us right now?

1073
01:09:24,394 --> 01:09:26,461
Let's just say, three feet.

1074
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:30,231
And you choose
which side you land on.

1075
01:09:30,233 --> 01:09:31,499
No.

1076
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:34,869
Why? Are you afraid
of getting hurt?

1077
01:09:37,374 --> 01:09:40,942
Okay, lets say two feet.

1078
01:09:40,944 --> 01:09:41,943
One foot?

1079
01:09:41,945 --> 01:09:44,179
Objection. Your Honor,

1080
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:45,647
if Mr. Pepper
wants someone to fall,

1081
01:09:45,649 --> 01:09:47,715
let him demonstrate it himself.

1082
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:49,584
Sustained. Mr. Pepper.

1083
01:10:01,631 --> 01:10:03,432
Can you tell me what this is?

1084
01:10:03,967 --> 01:10:05,500
That's a physics equation.

1085
01:10:05,502 --> 01:10:10,371
Force equals mass
times acceleration.

1086
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:12,941
Now, based on this equation,

1087
01:10:12,943 --> 01:10:15,510
can you tell me at what force.

1088
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:17,912
Kevin's body
hit the ground with?

1089
01:10:19,516 --> 01:10:21,883
No. No, I can't.

1090
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:23,551
Why not?

1091
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:25,820
Look,
I'm a medical examiner, okay?

1092
01:10:25,822 --> 01:10:27,989
I'm not good at math.

1093
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:33,494
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1094
01:10:41,371 --> 01:10:44,105
<i>The court room</i>

1095
01:10:44,106 --> 01:10:46,840
<i>is one of the most</i>
<i>unpredictable places on earth.</i>

1096
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:50,612
<i>You never know</i>
<i>exactly what you're up against.</i>

1097
01:10:50,614 --> 01:10:54,249
<i>You just hope</i>
<i>you can inspire that jury.</i>

1098
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:57,552
I've known Officer Dodge
for six years;

1099
01:10:57,554 --> 01:10:59,254
Detective Pebble for ten.

1100
01:10:59,256 --> 01:11:00,888
How would you describe
Officer Dodge?

1101
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:04,525
Well, he's a big young man,
but he's certainly not a bully.

1102
01:11:04,527 --> 01:11:07,028
He's just an officer
that comes to work every day,

1103
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:08,930
and goes about
his business quietly.

1104
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:10,565
And Detective Pebble?

1105
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:11,866
Oh, Detective Pebble is simply

1106
01:11:11,868 --> 01:11:13,401
the best cop
I've ever worked with.

1107
01:11:13,403 --> 01:11:17,005
Chief Wilson, have
you ever known Officer Dodge

1108
01:11:17,007 --> 01:11:19,540
to have a problem
with his temper?

1109
01:11:19,542 --> 01:11:22,343
The young man had some
difficulties in Vietnam,

1110
01:11:22,345 --> 01:11:23,645
but since I've known him,

1111
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,880
he's made hundreds of arrests
without incident,

1112
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:28,616
all of them good.

1113
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:31,351
Chief, would you please
tell this court your opinion

1114
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:35,723
on the theory that Kevin
Thacker's death was a cover-up.

1115
01:11:35,725 --> 01:11:39,494
No, no. Not in my department.

1116
01:11:39,496 --> 01:11:41,329
Simply there wasn't
enough time.

1117
01:11:41,331 --> 01:11:44,932
I mean, you take this arbitrary
video tape of the ordeal,

1118
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:47,235
one to seven minutes.

1119
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:49,537
There's not enough time
in there to concoct a cover-up.

1120
01:11:49,539 --> 01:11:51,005
Thank you, Chief Wilson.

1121
01:11:51,007 --> 01:11:53,308
No further questions
at this time, Your Honor.

1122
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:55,677
Mr. Pepper?

1123
01:11:55,679 --> 01:12:00,481
Well, actually,
the time frame is quite clear.

1124
01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:01,883
Dodge sounded the alarm

1125
01:12:01,885 --> 01:12:05,620
at 1:17 a.m.,

1126
01:12:05,622 --> 01:12:07,922
that's from your station logs,

1127
01:12:07,924 --> 01:12:10,792
and Dodge discovered
the body at 1:24 a.m.

1128
01:12:10,794 --> 01:12:13,594
That's seven minutes.

1129
01:12:14,898 --> 01:12:17,432
Should we allow the court to
have seven minutes of silence

1130
01:12:17,434 --> 01:12:21,436
right now, just to understand
how long that actually is?

1131
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,393
That's not even
30 seconds, Chief.

1132
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:52,567
Do you really think that
this couldn't have occurred?

1133
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:56,070
Not on my watch;
Not in my department.

1134
01:13:02,712 --> 01:13:07,615
Detective Pebble, how long have
you known Officer John Dodge?

1135
01:13:08,852 --> 01:13:10,918
Ten years.

1136
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,621
And just to be clear
for the court,

1137
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:16,891
it was you who investigated
the death of Kevin Thacker?

1138
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:19,694
Yes, I did.

1139
01:13:19,696 --> 01:13:22,797
Did you investigate whether
John Dodge committed a crime

1140
01:13:22,799 --> 01:13:26,534
on the night
of October 29th, 1983?

1141
01:13:26,536 --> 01:13:29,670
No.

1142
01:13:29,672 --> 01:13:33,007
Well, why not?

1143
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:35,943
No crime was committed,
except by Kevin Thacker.

1144
01:13:35,945 --> 01:13:40,047
You never,
not even for a moment,

1145
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:44,152
considered the culpability
of Officer Dodge?

1146
01:13:45,989 --> 01:13:47,822
There's no evidence
to support that.

1147
01:13:47,824 --> 01:13:50,625
Where were you
during the booking?

1148
01:13:51,961 --> 01:13:54,962
Somebody was getting beat up
across the street,

1149
01:13:54,964 --> 01:13:56,597
I was on a radio call for that.

1150
01:13:56,599 --> 01:14:00,668
But, I returned shortly after
the ambulance was called.

1151
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:02,136
And, where was Officer Dodge?

1152
01:14:02,138 --> 01:14:04,906
He was with the victim.

1153
01:14:04,908 --> 01:14:07,575
Who notified Kevin's parents?

1154
01:14:07,577 --> 01:14:08,976
The Des Moines PD.

1155
01:14:08,978 --> 01:14:12,046
Why didn't you do
the notification?

1156
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:14,882
Because I was busy collecting
evidence and statements

1157
01:14:14,884 --> 01:14:18,119
with respect to Mr. Thacker's
unfortunate fall.

1158
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:20,721
Really? Well, what
did that consist of?

1159
01:14:20,723 --> 01:14:24,826
Talking to the parties involved;
Interviewing them.

1160
01:14:24,828 --> 01:14:27,061
That's when I found out
about Kevin's mental state

1161
01:14:27,063 --> 01:14:29,230
during the arrest.

1162
01:14:29,232 --> 01:14:32,633
Turns out
the boy was broken-hearted.

1163
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:35,937
How could you possibly be aware
of Kevin's mental state?

1164
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:37,555
Because I interviewed
his boyfriend.

1165
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,172
His boyfriend said he had
showed up at Marshalltown...

1166
01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:42,243
Detective,
Kevin's sexual orientation

1167
01:14:42,245 --> 01:14:43,945
is not on trial here,

1168
01:14:43,947 --> 01:14:46,881
your colleague John Dodge is.

1169
01:14:46,883 --> 01:14:48,616
Look, I'm not going
to allow you

1170
01:14:48,618 --> 01:14:50,318
to dance around this
any longer.

1171
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,019
I want you to tell the court,
beat by beat,

1172
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:54,489
moment by moment,
what happened?

1173
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:58,693
Prisoner is loose
in the building.

1174
01:15:27,924 --> 01:15:32,226
So he did all this,
while intoxicated,

1175
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:34,095
leaping like
a world-class athlete,

1176
01:15:34,097 --> 01:15:35,696
dropping the cigarette
and lighter,

1177
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:40,067
and falling 24 feet,
only sustaining one injury.

1178
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:41,869
Yes, it appears that way, yes.

1179
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:44,572
After Kevin was taken
to the hospital,

1180
01:15:44,574 --> 01:15:47,041
why did have his clothes
ordered back to the station?

1181
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:49,110
To be used as evidence.
I already told you that.

1182
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:52,713
And to allow you to fabricate
your version of the events.

1183
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:54,615
You had time
to plant the cigarette,

1184
01:15:54,617 --> 01:15:58,553
and create the evidence, because
it didn't matter, detective.

1185
01:15:58,555 --> 01:16:02,256
Kevin Thacker
was never on that roof.

1186
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:09,010
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1187
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:20,308
Thank you
for being here, Mrs. Thacker.

1188
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:22,910
I don't think anyone
in this room would argue

1189
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:25,279
that this is a very tough thing
for you to do.

1190
01:16:25,281 --> 01:16:29,050
It hasn't been easy.

1191
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:31,953
Will you please tell the court

1192
01:16:31,955 --> 01:16:35,356
a little bit about Kevin?

1193
01:16:35,358 --> 01:16:36,924
What he was like.

1194
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,225
Sure.

1195
01:16:38,227 --> 01:16:42,163
Kevin was a good son.

1196
01:16:42,165 --> 01:16:44,799
Very good son. Funny, smart.

1197
01:16:44,801 --> 01:16:49,236
He was going
to community college.

1198
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:52,039
Did...?

1199
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:54,875
Did Kevin have
a drinking problem?

1200
01:16:55,878 --> 01:16:59,614
I think he was just young,
acting his age.

1201
01:16:59,616 --> 01:17:03,217
Maybe a little lost at times.

1202
01:17:05,922 --> 01:17:09,290
You know, he may have had
some issues with alcohol,

1203
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:12,927
but I think more
he just never knew exactly

1204
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:16,330
where to direct his attention.

1205
01:17:16,332 --> 01:17:21,002
And what will you miss most

1206
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:22,269
about Kevin?

1207
01:17:22,271 --> 01:17:24,705
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

1208
01:17:24,707 --> 01:17:27,675
Trying to make
the deceased a person,

1209
01:17:27,677 --> 01:17:29,910
not just a name, Your Honor.

1210
01:17:29,912 --> 01:17:31,345
Overruled.

1211
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:33,414
You can answer, Ma'am.

1212
01:17:38,221 --> 01:17:42,823
I'll miss sitting at the table
with him, after dinner,

1213
01:17:42,825 --> 01:17:46,260
just the two of us, talking.

1214
01:17:46,262 --> 01:17:49,997
I used to give him the business
about putting on his shirt,

1215
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:53,000
and he'd never listen to me.

1216
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:56,337
He'd just say,
"We're done eatin', Ma. Relax."

1217
01:17:58,408 --> 01:18:02,743
Believe it or not,
I'll miss worrying about him.

1218
01:18:02,745 --> 01:18:05,012
It's just,
after you give birth,

1219
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:07,181
it becomes ingrained in you.

1220
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:10,451
It's just like a part of you,
as long as you live.

1221
01:18:10,453 --> 01:18:13,287
That worry
is just always there.

1222
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:15,222
I'll miss that.

1223
01:18:16,392 --> 01:18:18,059
And, what else will you miss?

1224
01:18:21,698 --> 01:18:24,131
Everything.

1225
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:27,068
Everything that would've
come after.

1226
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:40,281
Sorry.

1227
01:18:40,283 --> 01:18:42,883
Thank you, Beverly.

1228
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:56,030
Hey, guys.

1229
01:18:56,032 --> 01:18:58,552
Hey, Mike. How are you?

1230
01:18:59,068 --> 01:19:02,269
Stu?

1231
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:04,472
I want to tell you
how much I appreciate

1232
01:19:04,474 --> 01:19:08,409
your work on this case.

1233
01:19:08,411 --> 01:19:12,346
And I wish
Kevin could have met you.

1234
01:19:15,017 --> 01:19:16,350
Thank you.

1235
01:19:16,352 --> 01:19:18,085
Thanks.

1236
01:19:33,236 --> 01:19:37,138
You have
a difficult task today,

1237
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:41,275
and I'd like to start off
by thanking you

1238
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:44,278
for your time and attention

1239
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,114
in this crucial case.

1240
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:52,219
Your task today is difficult

1241
01:19:52,221 --> 01:19:55,022
because I'm asking you
to believe

1242
01:19:55,024 --> 01:19:59,260
that the people
you have been taught to trust

1243
01:19:59,262 --> 01:20:04,098
are the same people responsible
for the death of Kevin Thacker.

1244
01:20:05,301 --> 01:20:08,502
Now, if you asked me
a year ago,

1245
01:20:08,504 --> 01:20:11,305
if I believed something
like this could be be possible,

1246
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:15,075
I'd have had a hard time
believing it too.

1247
01:20:16,412 --> 01:20:20,414
But I'm learning.

1248
01:20:20,416 --> 01:20:24,051
I'm learning that, inherently,
we were put on this Earth

1249
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:27,154
to protect one another.

1250
01:20:30,092 --> 01:20:32,293
There's an old saying:

1251
01:20:32,295 --> 01:20:36,330
"Absolute power
corrupts absolutely."

1252
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,365
We've all heard that statement.

1253
01:20:38,367 --> 01:20:41,068
And it trickles all the way down
the power chain,

1254
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:44,038
from a president
to a meter maid.

1255
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:47,174
To make those who think
they're above the law

1256
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:50,911
be fearful of its consequences.

1257
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:55,015
Checks and balances.

1258
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:57,418
That sounds like
a pretty good idea to me.

1259
01:20:57,420 --> 01:21:00,988
What do you think?
I mean, there's history here.

1260
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:03,057
Going back to the Middle Ages,

1261
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:07,061
the Spanish Inquisition,
police states,

1262
01:21:07,063 --> 01:21:10,231
and the creation of laws.

1263
01:21:10,233 --> 01:21:11,432
New laws had to be passed

1264
01:21:11,434 --> 01:21:15,236
to keep the abuse of power
in check.

1265
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:19,540
The Fourth Amendment protects us
from search and seizure,

1266
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:23,444
and the Fourteenth Amendment
gives us our rights.

1267
01:21:23,446 --> 01:21:28,048
I never knew Kevin Thacker.

1268
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:32,119
But I've gotten to know
his parents pretty well.

1269
01:21:32,121 --> 01:21:36,223
And I've spoken personally to
everybody involved in this case.

1270
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:39,059
And, I learned that Kevin

1271
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:42,396
was really no different
than any of us.

1272
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:44,298
He was a young man,

1273
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:47,534
trying to find his way in life.

1274
01:21:47,536 --> 01:21:50,537
And Kevin, like us all,

1275
01:21:50,539 --> 01:21:53,607
had to face the consequences
of his decisions.

1276
01:21:53,609 --> 01:21:56,443
And that is not
an easy thing to do.

1277
01:21:58,514 --> 01:22:00,681
The consequence
to Kevin's decisions

1278
01:22:00,683 --> 01:22:03,684
on the night of October 29th

1279
01:22:03,686 --> 01:22:06,253
cost him his life.

1280
01:22:07,323 --> 01:22:09,957
But if you look at
the bigger picture,

1281
01:22:09,959 --> 01:22:13,060
it didn't have to.

1282
01:22:13,062 --> 01:22:15,229
It didn't have to.

1283
01:22:15,231 --> 01:22:17,965
Kevin died
while under the supervision

1284
01:22:17,967 --> 01:22:21,201
of the Marshalltown
Police Department.

1285
01:22:28,511 --> 01:22:33,213
There was not a soul in sight,
except for Officer Dodge.

1286
01:22:33,215 --> 01:22:36,450
Now, you've heard the details
of this case several times.

1287
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:40,120
The standing broad jump,
the intoxication,

1288
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:44,625
the press release prior
to notifying his own parents,

1289
01:22:44,627 --> 01:22:48,462
and the nature
of the single injury

1290
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:52,433
that is not consistent
with a fall of 24 feet.

1291
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:58,405
You are in the throws
of a cover-up.

1292
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:04,545
The corruption of power
by those who believe

1293
01:23:04,547 --> 01:23:08,182
that they are above law.

1294
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:11,051
But let me assure you,

1295
01:23:11,053 --> 01:23:14,488
no police department
wants bad blood on their hands,

1296
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:19,460
so you have to reconcile
yourselves to one simple fact

1297
01:23:19,462 --> 01:23:22,730
regarding the police
and the world that we live in.

1298
01:23:25,735 --> 01:23:30,037
These things do happen.

1299
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:33,207
Lady Justice is blindfolded,

1300
01:23:33,209 --> 01:23:37,644
but that is to remind us
that it is up to all of us

1301
01:23:37,646 --> 01:23:42,149
to keep our eyes wide open.

1302
01:23:44,553 --> 01:23:46,487
Thank you so much.

1303
01:24:19,155 --> 01:24:20,554
Stu?

1304
01:24:28,764 --> 01:24:30,264
Have you reached a verdict?

1305
01:24:30,266 --> 01:24:32,332
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

1306
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:42,142
"We, the jury,
find Officer John Dodge

1307
01:24:42,144 --> 01:24:44,845
"liable for the wrongful death
of Kevin Thacker,

1308
01:24:44,847 --> 01:24:49,149
and award $980,000
to his estate."

1309
01:25:55,184 --> 01:25:56,250
Guess what?

1310
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:02,456
Did somebody pass the bar?

1311
01:26:05,761 --> 01:26:06,760
Congratulations.

1312
01:26:06,762 --> 01:26:08,562
Thank you.

1313
01:26:08,564 --> 01:26:11,565
Might have a little competition
on your hands.

1314
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:15,402
Monica, I, uh...

1315
01:26:17,373 --> 01:26:20,174
I just have to thank you.

1316
01:26:20,176 --> 01:26:24,244
I couldn't have done this
without you.

1317
01:26:24,246 --> 01:26:27,781
Oh, it's nothing.

1318
01:26:27,783 --> 01:26:29,683
Counselor.

1319
01:26:32,755 --> 01:26:35,222
Counselor.

1320
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:41,862
<i>The unexamined life</i>
<i>is not worth living.</i>

1321
01:26:41,864 --> 01:26:44,565
<i>My victory took</i>
<i>nearly a year of my life,</i>

1322
01:26:44,567 --> 01:26:46,867
<i>of my family's life.</i>

1323
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:50,204
<i>You begin to understand</i>
<i>your own personal limits.</i>

1324
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:53,774
<i>What you are willing to trade</i>
<i>for that victory.</i>

1325
01:26:53,776 --> 01:26:57,711
<i>For the first time, I felt</i>
<i>that I was good at my job.</i>

1326
01:26:57,713 --> 01:26:59,780
<i>You can still find my name</i>
<i>in the Yellow Pages</i>

1327
01:26:59,782 --> 01:27:01,815
<i>along with everybody else.</i>

1328
01:27:01,817 --> 01:27:04,918
<i>A personal injury lawyer.</i>

1329
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:07,454
<i>Sometimes I just have to smile.</i>

1330
01:27:15,464 --> 01:27:17,497
There he is,
the man of the hour.

1331
01:27:17,499 --> 01:27:19,182
I wish you would've called.

1332
01:27:19,183 --> 01:27:20,866
I'm just heading out
for an off-site meeting.

1333
01:27:20,869 --> 01:27:22,936
I just wanted to
grab a quick word with you.

1334
01:27:22,938 --> 01:27:25,405
Hey, congratulations
on that victory.

1335
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:28,909
Well, to be honest, sir,
the real victory would be

1336
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:31,578
to have the offenders
punished in some way

1337
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:34,514
other than
the city's pocket book.

1338
01:27:34,516 --> 01:27:36,817
I wanted to offer my services
free of charge

1339
01:27:36,819 --> 01:27:38,986
to help expedite that
in any way possible.

1340
01:27:38,988 --> 01:27:41,355
Yeah, I think
we have that covered.

1341
01:27:41,357 --> 01:27:43,957
Have you assigned an agent
to investigate the case yet?

1342
01:27:43,959 --> 01:27:45,659
Yes, I have.

1343
01:27:45,661 --> 01:27:47,394
I thought about
your very kind advice,

1344
01:27:47,396 --> 01:27:49,963
but I decided
to put somebody on it

1345
01:27:49,965 --> 01:27:51,665
I'm a little more
comfortable with.

1346
01:27:51,667 --> 01:27:54,334
Appearances and what not.
I'm sure you understand.

1347
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:56,870
Who did you assign to the case?

1348
01:27:56,872 --> 01:27:58,905
Ben Higgins.

1349
01:27:58,907 --> 01:28:02,376
Doesn't he do undercover work
for Marshalltown cops?

1350
01:28:04,046 --> 01:28:06,780
Let me
tell you something, okay?

1351
01:28:06,782 --> 01:28:10,951
You did a good job,
nobody's denying that.

1352
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:13,453
But you have to know
when to walk away,

1353
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:15,722
when to move on.

1354
01:28:15,724 --> 01:28:18,659
And very frankly,
fucking with my department

1355
01:28:18,661 --> 01:28:21,762
doesn't help that along.

1356
01:28:48,991 --> 01:28:51,692
"Kevin Thacker
and the Marshalltown Police,

1357
01:28:51,694 --> 01:28:55,796
"for ten counts
against Mr. John Dodge.

1358
01:28:55,798 --> 01:28:57,998
Dismissed."

1359
01:29:01,370 --> 01:29:05,939
They're gonna be late.

1360
01:29:05,941 --> 01:29:07,674
Hello?

1361
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:09,408
<i>Beverly? It's Stu, hey.</i>

1362
01:29:09,411 --> 01:29:11,011
<i>Thomas there?</i>

1363
01:29:11,013 --> 01:29:13,493
Yes, hi, Stu. Hold on.

1364
01:29:15,551 --> 01:29:16,616
Hi, Stu.

1365
01:29:16,618 --> 01:29:18,018
Hey.

1366
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:22,456
Look, I'm really sorry
to bother you on Christmas Eve.

1367
01:29:22,458 --> 01:29:24,424
We got some bad news.

1368
01:29:25,394 --> 01:29:26,760
<i>Hallow threw it out.</i>

1369
01:29:26,762 --> 01:29:27,828
Threw what out?

1370
01:29:31,066 --> 01:29:33,967
In civil cases,

1371
01:29:33,969 --> 01:29:35,736
the law gives the judge
the power

1372
01:29:35,738 --> 01:29:37,471
to overturn the jury verdict.

1373
01:29:38,507 --> 01:29:39,840
Now that's bullshit.

1374
01:29:39,842 --> 01:29:41,942
What?

1375
01:29:41,944 --> 01:29:43,810
The judge threw the case out.

1376
01:29:49,952 --> 01:29:51,685
<i>Well, what are we gonna do?</i>

1377
01:29:51,687 --> 01:29:54,388
We appeal it to the State
Supreme Court for a reversal

1378
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:58,392
and get the original
verdict reinstated.

1379
01:29:58,394 --> 01:29:59,860
<i>I can't let it go.</i>

1380
01:29:59,862 --> 01:30:02,396
I'm in this for the long haul.

1381
01:30:02,398 --> 01:30:05,098
I'm right there with you.

1382
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:08,402
Listen,
you have a good holiday,

1383
01:30:08,404 --> 01:30:11,405
<i>and I'll talk to you</i>
<i>after the new year.</i>

1384
01:30:11,407 --> 01:30:13,073
<i>God bless you.</i>

1385
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:14,875
Thank you. Thank you, Thomas.

1401
01:31:33,222 --> 01:31:36,823
¶ I was the storm ¶

1402
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:44,564
¶ The storm of storms ¶

1403
01:31:44,566 --> 01:31:47,701
¶ So now you know ¶

1404
01:31:47,703 --> 01:31:50,136
¶ I was the sea ¶

1405
01:31:50,138 --> 01:31:53,707
¶ Cold as I could be ¶

1406
01:31:53,709 --> 01:31:57,143
¶ I was anything but free ¶

1407
01:31:57,145 --> 01:32:00,514
¶ As far as I could see ¶

1408
01:32:00,516 --> 01:32:03,583
¶ I was anything but me ¶

1409
01:32:07,289 --> 01:32:10,757
¶ I was all on my own ¶

1410
01:32:11,894 --> 01:32:15,595
¶ Without myself ¶

1411
01:32:19,768 --> 01:32:23,003
¶ Think about the way ¶

1412
01:32:23,005 --> 01:32:26,940
¶ You have to fight ¶

1413
01:32:26,942 --> 01:32:30,176
¶ When you're always right ¶

1414
01:32:33,215 --> 01:32:35,882
¶ Think about the rose ¶

1415
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:39,653
¶ With too many thorns ¶

1416
01:32:39,655 --> 01:32:44,558
¶ No one will stand
by your side ¶

1417
01:32:49,665 --> 01:32:53,667
¶ No one stands by your side ¶

1418
01:32:53,669 --> 01:32:57,304
¶ No one will stand
by your side ¶

1419
01:33:04,913 --> 01:33:09,082
¶ I walked alone ¶

1420
01:33:11,887 --> 01:33:15,822
¶ I found myself
without a home ¶

1421
01:33:15,824 --> 01:33:20,293
¶ As hard as a stone ¶

1422
01:33:20,295 --> 01:33:23,163
¶ But truth be told ¶

1423
01:33:23,165 --> 01:33:26,232
¶ I was the storm ¶

1424
01:33:29,805 --> 01:33:34,074
¶ The storm of storms ¶

1425
01:33:34,076 --> 01:33:37,143
¶ So now you know ¶

1426
01:33:39,982 --> 01:33:43,049
¶ Without my soul ¶

1427
01:33:46,755 --> 01:33:50,790
¶ All on my own ¶

1428
01:33:51,994 --> 01:33:54,160
¶ I was the sea ¶

1429
01:33:54,162 --> 01:33:58,131
¶ Cold as I could be ¶

1430
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:01,301
¶ I was anything but free ¶

1431
01:34:01,303 --> 01:34:04,404
¶ As far as I could see ¶

1432
01:34:04,406 --> 01:34:07,974
¶ I was anything but me ¶

1433
01:34:09,411 --> 01:34:11,277
¶ And me alone ¶

1434
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:15,715
¶ I was all on my own ¶

1435
01:34:15,717 --> 01:34:19,753
¶ Without my soul ¶

1436
01:34:25,027 --> 01:34:29,963
¶ I went walking
down the road ¶

1437
01:34:29,965 --> 01:34:34,134
¶ The road for the blind ¶

1438
01:34:34,136 --> 01:34:37,804
¶ For a long, long time ¶
