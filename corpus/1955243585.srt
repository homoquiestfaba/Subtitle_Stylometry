1
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:20,198
Check out
the yo-yo.

2
00:00:20,234 --> 00:00:22,032
What a dork.

3
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:29,232
There's the
yo-yo kid.

4
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:32,332
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe he brought it to school.

5
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,365
Will!

6
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:44,865
How's it
goin'?

7
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:45,832
Great, chuckie.

8
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:47,165
Positively great.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,499
Really? Isn't today
report card day?

10
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:51,432
Yep. And once again,
i'll show you

11
00:00:51,467 --> 00:00:52,598
that the will browning
method of sliding by

12
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:53,999
just can't be beat.

13
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:56,232
Such confidence. I love it.

14
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:58,632
Watch and learn, chuckie.
Watch and learn.

15
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:04,198
Oh, hi, will.

16
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:06,132
Is this your locker?

17
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:08,132
Maybe. Why?

18
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:10,665
Well, i moved my
locker here.

19
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,899
I wanted to change
my lousy spot.

20
00:01:12,934 --> 00:01:15,298
So, will, i was just
wondering--

21
00:01:15,334 --> 00:01:16,965
i mean,
with the junior social just around the corner--

22
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:19,865
sorry, heather. I don't
know how to dance.

23
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:21,298
I gotta go. We'll talk
sometime, though.

24
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:22,165
Do lunch.

25
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,465
Really? When?

26
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,632
Uh, sometime.

27
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,532
Do lunch? Who are
you, tom cruise?

28
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:31,698
It's an expression. It means,
maybe next millennium.

29
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:34,198
And as i give you
your report cards,

30
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:36,165
i think this is a good
time to remind you

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,432
that your science projects
are due in three weeks.

32
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,432
I got it covered.

33
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:43,965
For some of you

34
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:47,999
the project is very,
very, very important.

35
00:01:48,034 --> 00:01:50,265
Because if you don't get
at least a "b,"

36
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,865
i'll be seeing you again
in this class next year.

37
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:06,399
That bad?

38
00:02:06,434 --> 00:02:09,798
Nah. It's no biggie.

39
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:17,098
Watch it, browning.

40
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,399
Scottie desota.

41
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:22,198
Man, does he
hate you!

42
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:23,765
I get the guy in
trouble once

43
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,232
and he holds a
grudge forever.

44
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:27,265
Trouble? You got
him suspended.

45
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,665
There's a
difference.

46
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,865
Let's get out of here.

47
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:32,499
I better get home and work
on my science project.

48
00:02:32,534 --> 00:02:34,265
Whatever it is,
throw it away

49
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,399
and do a real
one, will.

50
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:36,399
You gotta nail it.

51
00:02:36,434 --> 00:02:38,765
Come on. Who needs
an "a," anyway?

52
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,565
Uh, you do.

53
00:02:43,967 --> 00:02:45,532
Voila!

54
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,232
Does it have
a name?

55
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:52,999
Oh, it's oat bran with
some varietal tree bark.

56
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:54,899
It promotes healing, peace,

57
00:02:54,934 --> 00:02:56,499
and togetherness.

58
00:02:56,534 --> 00:02:58,365
Honey, we have
no plates.

59
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:00,732
No, no. We don't
need plates.

60
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:02,932
This is a common pot.

61
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:04,798
We all eat from it.

62
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,665
It's a family
bonding thing.

63
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,899
Yeah, right.

64
00:03:08,934 --> 00:03:10,132
Maybe with some glue,

65
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:11,632
you could bond
me and goofball.

66
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:12,965
Allana.

67
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:15,165
So, where are we going on
our next family vacation?

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,732
I love it when we
travel together.

69
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:19,665
Anyone want to see
my report card?

70
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,665
I can hardly
wait.

71
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:31,165
Um, allana, this
is terrific.

72
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,832
I guess it runs
in the family.

73
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:35,665
Right, will?

74
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,532
Allana.

75
00:03:52,834 --> 00:03:54,765
There must be
some mistake.

76
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,632
A "d" is science. An "f"
in social studies?

77
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,098
Social studies, will?

78
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:02,365
You can get at least a
"c" in social studies

79
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:04,132
if you answer every
question "washington."

80
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:06,932
And the same comments over and over again.

81
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:08,232
"Doesn't apply himself."

82
00:04:08,267 --> 00:04:09,865
"Not enough effort."
"Not trying."

83
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:11,365
I try. You know i try.

84
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:13,132
But, will, if
you're trying,

85
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:15,698
why do all your teachers say you aren't?

86
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:17,999
You leave us no choice--

87
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:21,165
we have to go to plan "b."

88
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,198
Plan "b"?

89
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:26,432
I'm not gonna like
plan "b," am i?

90
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:32,198
Camp sparticus.

91
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:33,132
Yes!

92
00:04:33,167 --> 00:04:35,565
No! Please!
Anything but that!

93
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,932
It's a prison camp!

94
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:39,665
It's a highly respected
summer boot camp for boys.

95
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,465
It's not a punishment.

96
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:44,198
A summer at camp sparticus will
teach you discipline and responsibility.

97
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:45,798
It'll teach you to
push yourself.

98
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:47,798
It'll turn me into a mindless,
uniform-wearing machine.

99
00:04:47,834 --> 00:04:49,232
Cool.

100
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:50,665
No more discussion, will.

101
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,999
Unless we see a significant
improvement in your grades,

102
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:55,899
you'll be spending the
summer at camp sparticus.

103
00:04:55,934 --> 00:04:57,798
It's up to you.

104
00:04:57,834 --> 00:05:01,198
<i>Sparticus, the camp of</i>
<i>misery and despair?</i>

105
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,332
What am i gonna do?

106
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:03,632
How 'bout school work?

107
00:05:03,667 --> 00:05:05,132
Maybe start with your
science project.

108
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:07,899
<i>I mean, apply yourself</i>
<i>for a change.</i>

109
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:09,465
Who are you,
my annoying third parent?

110
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:12,265
No, just a guy who doesn't
want to spend his summer

111
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,865
without his best friend.

112
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:15,365
[Knocking]

113
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,332
i gotta go. Bye.

114
00:05:19,501 --> 00:05:22,298
Mom, do you think camp sparticus will still let me in

115
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:24,565
if i can somehow make one leg shorter than the other?

116
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,432
It's a pretty
clever idea.

117
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:29,798
Maybe you should use
some of that brain power

118
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:31,232
on your school
work, huh?

119
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:32,865
Whatta ya think?

120
00:05:32,901 --> 00:05:37,298
Sorry, mom. Allana
gets "a"s, not me.

121
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:40,832
Sweetheart, i don't
care about "a"s.

122
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:43,098
I care about effort.

123
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,432
And so does your dad.

124
00:05:45,467 --> 00:05:48,632
He cares very much.

125
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,399
Just try, will.
That's all we ask.

126
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,565
Don't hold back so much.

127
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,298
You are a wonderful,
smart, talented guy.

128
00:05:57,334 --> 00:05:59,832
Let people know about it.

129
00:06:01,634 --> 00:06:03,698
That's all i wanted to say.

130
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:06,698
Goodnight, sweetheart.

131
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:26,532
"Grow your own fun!"

132
00:06:29,934 --> 00:06:32,198
Hello, science project.

133
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,098
"Ocean pups"

134
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:01,065
one becomes two, victor.

135
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,265
Hypercloning.

136
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,765
The greatest advance in
science in 100 years.

137
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:11,432
We're gonna be filthy rich.

138
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:13,432
Conrad, how many times
do i have to tell you?

139
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,965
It's not about the money.

140
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:18,332
It's about everything
we can buy with it.

141
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:19,899
That's right.

142
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:22,832
Soon we'll be out of
this miserable place.

143
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:25,232
We won't have to use
this company as a front

144
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:27,232
to hide our research anymore.

145
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:31,098
We're gonna work in a
hi-tech laboratory.

146
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:33,499
With real white lab coats.

147
00:07:33,534 --> 00:07:35,399
And lab assistants.

148
00:07:35,434 --> 00:07:38,665
With name tags.

149
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,465
Grape juice?

150
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:44,965
Hmmm.

151
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:03,198
Yes!

152
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,732
"Science has never
been this much fun."

153
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:09,698
"These pets are sure to amaze."

154
00:09:09,734 --> 00:09:12,499
I'm ready to be amazed.

155
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:15,965
"The water temperature
must be more than 68

156
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:18,132
but less than 75 degrees."

157
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:23,798
Perfect. 72 degrees.

158
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:27,798
Next, the eggs...

159
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:30,132
don't let me down, boys.

160
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:33,198
My summer rests on
your little legs.

161
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:35,632
Or whatever you got.

162
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:39,999
Weird-looking things.

163
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:43,232
Where's the stirrer?

164
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:50,532
Guess a little of my
hair won't hurt.

165
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:58,232
Now what?

166
00:09:58,267 --> 00:09:59,765
"You should see some results

167
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,465
within the next 48-72 hours"?

168
00:10:03,234 --> 00:10:05,265
Two days?

169
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,465
Or less.

170
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,965
Customer service.
I need customer service.

171
00:10:58,001 --> 00:11:00,532

was it satisfactory?

I don't know.

177
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,399

00:11:11,434 --> 00:11:13,098

179

Ok, mr. Browning, let
me get my handbook.

<i>Mr. Browning, there's</i>
<i>nothing in the handbook</i>

183
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,665
<i>relating to your</i>
<i>particular problem.</i>

184
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,832
What?!

185
00:12:50,867 --> 00:12:53,165
<i>Well, i've done an</i>
<i>exhaustive search</i>

186
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,665
<i>through all of our databases.</i>

187
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,865
<i>I also checked the indexes of</i>
<i>earlier manuals for our kit--</i>

188
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:58,999
what?!

189
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:01,465
<i>I even consulted our</i>
<i>research department</i>

190
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:02,798
and they confirmed
that the handbook

191
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:04,232
doesn't say anything
about lights and spouts.

192
00:13:06,334 --> 00:13:07,198
Don't!

193
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:08,965
<i>No, it don't.</i>

194
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:11,532
Maybe you could describe
your problem again.

195
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:12,698
No. Put it down.

196
00:13:12,734 --> 00:13:14,499
<i>No?</i>
No!

197
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:15,899
Sir, are you there?

198
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:18,732
Yep. I'm here.

199
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,132
<i>Sir, hello?</i>

200
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:24,232
Gotta go. Love
your kit. Bye.

201
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,032
We gotta talk.

202
00:13:38,867 --> 00:13:41,598
For starters...

203
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:44,432
put that on.

204
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:49,032
No. Not like that.

205
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:51,298
Like... that.

206
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:57,665
You look just like me.

207
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:01,798
Me?

208
00:14:01,834 --> 00:14:03,665
You speak?

209
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:07,165
Speak?

210
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,132
This is too weird.

211
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:12,198
What's going on?

212
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:13,732
I mean, where'd
you come from?

213
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,098
Miss pinkerson talked about
something like this in science class.

214
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,365
"Cloning: the creation by laboratory
technique of an organism

215
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:27,499
that is an identical
copy of its parent."

216
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,765
Holy "a" in science class!

217
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,798
I made myself a clone!

218
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:37,399
The greatest science
project ever!

219
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:43,999
"The science of cloning is
still in its infancy."

220
00:14:44,034 --> 00:14:45,698
You can read?

221
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:47,132
Intense.

222
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,065
My parents are home.

223
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,365
All right, listen up.

224
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:56,698
In a few minutes i'm gonna
have to go downstairs

225
00:14:56,734 --> 00:14:57,899
and scarf some dinner.

226
00:14:57,934 --> 00:14:59,399
Scarf?

227
00:14:59,434 --> 00:15:02,765
Eat. Consume.

228
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,165
It's all in there.
Read about it.

229
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,065
And stay here.

230
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,332
Put on some clothes.

231
00:15:08,367 --> 00:15:09,965
Put on some clothes.

232
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:11,298
Keep quiet.

233
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:14,832
And keep quiet. Shhh.

234
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,632
It was a strange
phone call.

235
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,132
I mean, the kid, he
sounded so strange.

236
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,065
I thought it was worth
saying something.

237
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,132
I don't know what you guys
are doing in there, anyway.

238
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:25,865
I told you we should've
gotten rid of these animals!

239
00:15:28,634 --> 00:15:30,765
Game over, pal. That's it.

240
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,832
Our secret's out.
Poof. Gone.

241
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:34,399
Gone to some kid named...

242
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,865
will browning.

243
00:15:39,234 --> 00:15:41,432
The kid just got a
weird reaction.

244
00:15:41,467 --> 00:15:42,798
It doesn't mean anything.

245
00:15:42,834 --> 00:15:45,132
What if he accidentally
clones something?

246
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:46,532
His dog or his cat?

247
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,899
We don't have
patents, remember?

248
00:15:48,934 --> 00:15:52,399
"We don't need them
yet," you said.

249
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:55,999
"No one will ever find out about
hypercloning," you said.

250
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:08,499
Feel better?

251
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:09,632
Much better.

252
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,598
Sorry about that.

253
00:16:11,634 --> 00:16:13,632
So what's our
next move?

254
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:16,598
We're taking a
road trip.

255
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:20,832
Well, will,
what's the science project you've been working on?

256
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:23,399
I'd rather not say.

257
00:16:23,434 --> 00:16:24,932
I don't want to
jinx it.

258
00:16:24,967 --> 00:16:28,065
Ha. Ding, ding, ding.

259
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,698
That means, for our home
viewing audience,

260
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:33,665
that will isn't working
on any project at all.

261
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,732
I happen to be working
very hard on one.

262
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:45,465
<i>Done!</i>

263
00:16:45,501 --> 00:16:46,598
Done.

264
00:16:46,634 --> 00:16:48,165
<i>We have a winner</i>
<i>and a new champion.</i>

265
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,065
<i>And here are your prizes.</i>

266
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,865
<i>A brand new refrigerator,</i>

267
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:53,832
<i>a brand new freezer--</i>

268
00:17:28,534 --> 00:17:30,565
<i>yeah, cranking it</i>
<i>up on the dark side</i>

269
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,899
<i>is the new shawn peak kicker,</i>

270
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:33,899
<i>with his latest fabled addition</i>

271
00:17:33,934 --> 00:17:35,965
<i>to his multi,</i>
<i>multi-platinum catalog.</i>

272
00:17:36,001 --> 00:17:37,598
<i>Now stay in there,</i>
<i>little bigbees.</i>

273
00:17:37,634 --> 00:17:38,765
Bigbee.

274
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,832
<i>We've got lots more</i>
<i>hits coming your way.</i>

275
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,432
[Both screaming]

276
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:02,065
what? What's wrong?

277
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,032
Uh, nothing. I'm fine.

278
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:05,198
Will, you screamed.

279
00:18:05,234 --> 00:18:06,965
Screaming implies
something bad.

280
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:09,298
No, i just screamed.

281
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:11,832
A little.

282
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,965
May i be excused?

283
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:16,832
Before dessert? I made
rutabaga popsicles.

284
00:18:16,867 --> 00:18:20,065
Tempting, but can i go?

285
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:30,932
Hello?

286
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,365
Where are you?

287
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:41,399
What are you doing
down there?

288
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:45,198
Who's that?

289
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:47,232
That?

290
00:18:47,267 --> 00:18:50,065
It's just a mask.

291
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,098
It's not real. See?

292
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,798
Oooooh. Grrrrr.

293
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:59,332
It's fake.
Just pretend.

294
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:00,399
For halloween.

295
00:19:00,434 --> 00:19:01,765
It scared me.

296
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,198
I screamed.

297
00:19:03,234 --> 00:19:05,465
Whoa. Talk about scary.

298
00:19:05,501 --> 00:19:07,098
The underwear goes
in the inside.

299
00:19:07,134 --> 00:19:09,732
And you gotta kill
the tie.

300
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:11,165
Kill it?

301
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,499
Take it off. Lose it.

302
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:18,332
You know, i screamed too.

303
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,798
At dinner.

304
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:21,765
Well, why did you scream?

305
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,098
You know how twins
can supposedly

306
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:25,798
communicate psychically
or something?

307
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:26,832
No.

308
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,598
Yeah, well...

309
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,365
never mind.

310
00:19:31,434 --> 00:19:33,032
What were you doing in
the closet, anyway?

311
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:34,698
I told you to look
at the book.

312
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:36,032
I finished that book.

313
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:37,332
You read the whole thing?

314
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,565
No way.

315
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,965
Yes way.

316
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:43,598
The chapter on the classification of matter-- intense.

317
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:46,165
All right, tell me
about azurite.

318
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,832
Azurite. A blue mineral with
the formula cu3 (oh) 2 (c03) 2.

319
00:19:50,867 --> 00:19:53,332
It is often associated with
the green mineral malachite,

320
00:19:53,367 --> 00:19:55,965
since they've both been used as
pigments and as gemstones.

321
00:19:56,001 --> 00:19:57,565
You're a genus!

322
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,499
Now what?

323
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:01,598
I need to scarf.

324
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:04,632
Oh, right. I mean,
you must be hungry,

325
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,232
being new to the
planet, and all.

326
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:07,832
I'll get you some food.
It'll only take a second.

327
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:09,798
So stay right here.

328
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,565
Will?

329
00:20:31,767 --> 00:20:32,999
What do you
call this?

330
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:34,232
It's a picture
of my family.

331
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,098
And my family?

332
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,465
No. My family.

333
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:39,232
Although, if you
want 'em...

334
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:40,932
now get back in my room.

335
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:42,399
I've got to keep you hidden until i
know what i'm gonna do with you.

336
00:20:42,434 --> 00:20:43,865
Allana: you better not be in the bathroom.

337
00:20:43,901 --> 00:20:45,732
My sister! Come on.

338
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,298
And stop talking to
yourself, dip boy.

339
00:20:49,334 --> 00:20:51,465
You're not that
interesting.

340
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:54,532
Shhh. Quiet.

341
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,698
C'mon, c'mon.

342
00:20:56,734 --> 00:20:59,098
Stay close. Follow me.

343
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:09,032
Honey, this calculator's
dying on me.

344
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:11,298
Batteries are in the utility room.
Right hand door.

345
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:13,065
Get over there.

346
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:20,965
Pssst. C'mon.

347
00:21:29,534 --> 00:21:30,965
Find 'em?

348
00:21:31,001 --> 00:21:32,899
Found them.

349
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:35,232
Oh, no.

350
00:21:39,634 --> 00:21:40,565
Oh. Hi, will.

351
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:53,499
How's it goin'?

352
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:55,198
Fine.

353
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,232
Aah!

354
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:23,465
Weren't you just...

355
00:22:23,501 --> 00:22:25,432
why are you...

356
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:27,365
didn't you...

357
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:28,832
weren't you just wearing--

358
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:31,198
no, no. I'm just...

359
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:45,332
honey, could you just...

360
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:47,598
open the fridge door?

361
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:48,832
Please?

362
00:22:56,734 --> 00:22:58,065
Where are you going?

363
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,098
To the kitchen.

364
00:22:59,134 --> 00:23:00,598
Why?
To get a snack.

365
00:23:00,634 --> 00:23:02,098
You just ate dinner.

366
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:02,999
I'm hungry.

367
00:23:03,034 --> 00:23:03,965
Snacks are
bad for you.

368
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:04,865
Are you kidding?

369
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:05,965
With your mother's
cooking,

370
00:23:06,001 --> 00:23:07,032
snacks are what
keep me alive.

371
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,265
Right.

372
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,965
Excuse me.

373
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:16,365
Ooh.

374
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,632
Of course
you can.

375
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:25,798
I'll just reheat it.

376
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:29,098
What are you
trying to do?

377
00:23:29,134 --> 00:23:30,332
Just stay with me.

378
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,665
Wait a second. Weren't...

379
00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:43,665
what's your mother putting in this food, anyway?

380
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,532
Upstairs. My room. Go.

381
00:23:56,467 --> 00:24:00,098
Oh, cholesterol.

382
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:01,465
Sweetheart...

383
00:24:01,501 --> 00:24:03,332
hi, honey.

384
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:08,298
Will?

385
00:24:10,434 --> 00:24:12,332
Honey, what are you
doing down there?

386
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:18,298
I... dropped a...

387
00:24:18,334 --> 00:24:19,698
thing.

388
00:24:22,001 --> 00:24:24,165
I'll be leaving now.

389
00:24:30,267 --> 00:24:34,932
Just, uh, eating some...

390
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:37,165
yummy leftovers.

391
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:39,865
Yummy.

392
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:42,365
It's even
better cold.

393
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,098
Sucking up to mom to
save your life

394
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:50,565
when your grades tank?

395
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:53,232
I know what you're up to.

396
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:56,565
Allana, you can't begin to
fathom what i'm up to.

397
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,198
Hmmm.

398
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:10,098
Enjoy that, huh?

399
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,098
Uh-huh.

400
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,165
I guess it takes
all kinds.

401
00:25:16,467 --> 00:25:18,032
[Burps]

402
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:21,265
i'm losing air.

403
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:24,198
That was a burp.

404
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:26,432
A belch. Perfectly normal.

405
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:27,532
You've got no leaks.

406
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,698
Watch...

407
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:33,399
[burps]
see?

408
00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:36,665
Anything you want to know about
bodily functions, just ask.

409
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:40,798
[Yawns]

410
00:25:40,834 --> 00:25:42,399
what was that?

411
00:25:42,434 --> 00:25:43,965
A yawn. It means you're tired.

412
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,665
All that running around
must've gotten to you.

413
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,965
You've had a big day.

414
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:48,465
Was it a big day
for you too?

415
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:51,032
The biggest day of
my life, so far.

416
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:53,332
Even bigger than when i
got my tonsils removed.

417
00:25:53,367 --> 00:25:55,999
The tonsils play no part in the human body.

418
00:25:56,034 --> 00:25:57,632
They and the spleen
are the only organs

419
00:25:57,667 --> 00:25:58,999
that can be removed
with no concern.

420
00:25:59,034 --> 00:26:00,999
That's what your book said.

421
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,798
It's so amazing.

422
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:06,765
You look like me,
you talk like me,

423
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,399
but you have a
computer brain.

424
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:10,132
It's your brain too.

425
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:11,465
It's gotta be.

426
00:26:11,501 --> 00:26:13,365
I'm your clone.

427
00:26:13,401 --> 00:26:15,465
Hey, whatta i call you?

428
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:17,232
The other me?

429
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:19,732
Will two?

430
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:21,032
Twoie?

431
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,665
Twoie.

432
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,432
Twoie?

433
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:40,999
William?

434
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:42,798
[Knocking]

435
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:47,732
honey, are you
asleep already?

436
00:26:54,367 --> 00:26:56,265
I love you, sweetheart.

437
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,565
Goodnight.

438
00:27:10,534 --> 00:27:12,265
She thought you were me.

439
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,432
I am such a genius.

440
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:18,598
Get some sleep, my friend.

441
00:27:18,634 --> 00:27:19,999
'Cause come monday,

442
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:22,965
you're not going to school
as my science project,

443
00:27:23,001 --> 00:27:25,665
you're going to
school as me.

444
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:39,298
[Sighs]
oh!

445
00:27:39,334 --> 00:27:41,932
Don't tell me we're
actually here.

446
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:43,432
You and your
computer maps.

447
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:44,465
I'm not in the mood.

448
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:46,165
So let's just
raid the place

449
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,965
and figure out what
the kid cloned.

450
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,965
[Blows horn]

451
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:53,632
two words-- breaking
and entering.

452
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:56,365
They're bad when you
use them together.

453
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:58,265
First, we observe.

454
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,632
Observe?

455
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:02,432
We drove halfway across
the country to observe?

456
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:03,798
Observe what?

457
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:05,298
We look for two of anything.

458
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:08,432
Two poodles, two house cats,
two hamsters...

459
00:28:10,034 --> 00:28:11,632
where are we going now?

460
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:12,865
To load up on coffee

461
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,232
and poorly prepared
fast food.

462
00:28:15,267 --> 00:28:18,499
We are on a stakeout.

463
00:28:29,134 --> 00:28:33,098
<i>A family of grizzly bears has</i>
<i>chosen this spot to test the fishing.</i>

464
00:28:33,134 --> 00:28:35,198
<i>The family unit is essential</i>

465
00:28:35,234 --> 00:28:36,832
<i>to the survival of the cubs,</i>

466
00:28:36,867 --> 00:28:40,165
<i>who are just beginning to</i>
<i>explore the world around them.</i>

467
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,198
<i>Somebody say amen.</i>

468
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:43,465
Amen!

469
00:28:43,501 --> 00:28:46,499
<i>Amen! Amen!</i>

470
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,465
Did i hear you
shout "amen"?

471
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:54,999
Maybe.

472
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:58,765
Well, we're waiting for you,

473
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,698
so hurry up.

474
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,732
All right, now listen up.

475
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:08,032
I've gotta go visit grandpa
mordechai in the nursing home.

476
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:09,932
He's your family?

477
00:29:09,967 --> 00:29:12,332
Yep. Old, old,
old family.

478
00:29:12,367 --> 00:29:13,865
Family is good.

479
00:29:13,901 --> 00:29:16,198
The family unit is essential to
the survival of the cubs.

480
00:29:16,234 --> 00:29:18,532
The family units are what
send you to boot camp.

481
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:20,598
I'll be back in
a few hours.

482
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:22,999
Just watch tv.

483
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,999
Family.

484
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,732
Like the grizzly bear,

485
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:12,265
i must explore the
world around me.

486
00:30:22,934 --> 00:30:24,465
Hi, dad.

487
00:30:24,501 --> 00:30:27,532
Hey, mordechai. How
ya doin' today?

488
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:32,865
We brought the kids
along, mordechai.

489
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,198
Hi, grandpa.

490
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,632
Hi, gramps.

491
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:51,698
He's in his
zone again.

492
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,165

493
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:09,098
Twoie?

494
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,999
Ok, think. Where
could he be?

495
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,698
<i>Hey, can i play? Can i play?</i>

496
00:31:45,734 --> 00:31:47,798
Grass...

497
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:49,332
picnics.

498
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,132
The park!

499
00:31:55,401 --> 00:31:57,332
All right, go get it.

500
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,598
Nice catch!

501
00:32:00,634 --> 00:32:03,165
All right, bring
it here, boy.

502
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,332
Hey, can i play?

503
00:32:38,234 --> 00:32:39,365
Mom!

504

Twoie.

505
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,965
Twoie!

506
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,298
Hi. Isn't this
place great?

507
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:49,465
I told you not to
leave the house.

508
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:50,798
You said,
"watch tv."

509
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:51,865
I did that.

510
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:53,999
You gotta start
using your head!

511
00:32:54,034 --> 00:32:55,832
I couldn't find you.

512
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:58,332
How did you know
i was here?

513
00:32:58,367 --> 00:32:59,465
It just came to me.

514
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:01,198
Like when you were
scared and i screamed.

515
00:33:01,234 --> 00:33:02,765
Same thing.

516
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,632
Do i have a family?

517
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,165
No, i have a family.

518
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,798
You... you're just a clone.

519
00:33:13,267 --> 00:33:15,165
Let's get outta here.

520
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,932
Stay a block behind me,

521
00:33:16,967 --> 00:33:18,999
then wait in the garage
till i get you.

522
00:33:19,034 --> 00:33:21,865
I've got to start teaching you
the fine art of being me.

523
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:31,232
Now, show me the walk.

524
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:32,298
Ok.

525
00:33:32,334 --> 00:33:34,465
Let's see some
attitude this time.

526
00:33:39,001 --> 00:33:40,399
How was that?

527
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:45,565
Up... down...

528
00:33:55,001 --> 00:33:57,432
yooo! Ow.

529
00:33:57,467 --> 00:33:59,932
Ray corning. He's
in math class.

530
00:33:59,967 --> 00:34:01,098
He smells like
cabbage.

531
00:34:01,134 --> 00:34:04,432
Next, scottie desota.

532
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:06,399
We got him suspended.
We don't like him.

533
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:09,499
Very good.
You'll be ok.

534
00:34:09,534 --> 00:34:10,865
All right, high five.

535
00:34:12,434 --> 00:34:13,832
Oops.

536
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:14,765
Sorry.

537
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,698
My fault.

538
00:34:16,834 --> 00:34:18,632
No, no, no. You don't
just walk up to girls

539
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:19,832
and say, hey, baby.

540
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,198
But the man on
television did.

541
00:34:21,234 --> 00:34:22,965
That was an old movie.

542
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:24,632
Didn't you notice it was
in black and white?

543
00:34:24,667 --> 00:34:26,698
You mean new york city
doesn't look like that?

544
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:28,665
Sometimes you
sound so smart,

545
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,399
i'm afraid you're gonna make
me look like a geek.

546
00:34:30,434 --> 00:34:32,098
And sometimes...

547
00:34:32,134 --> 00:34:34,865
i'm sorry, will.
I'm really trying.

548
00:34:34,901 --> 00:34:35,899
My sister!

549
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:41,265
Twoie!

550
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,499
Twoie!

551
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:51,399
Uuh!

552
00:34:51,434 --> 00:34:55,365
What are you trying to do,
give me a heart attack?

553
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:58,932
What's your malfunction, toad?

554
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:00,198
Dark.

555
00:35:00,234 --> 00:35:01,865
What?

556
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:06,232
You are multi, multi, all
the way to the peak kicker.

557
00:35:06,267 --> 00:35:08,932
You are one crankin'
little bigbee.

558
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:10,899
All the way to the
fabled addition.

559
00:35:15,867 --> 00:35:19,265
Oh, i just hope i'm around
when you do that in public.

560
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,965
How did a clone like you
know stuff like that?

561
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,798
A thing called a
music video.

562
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:33,598
Yeah, well, you've got to learn
to keep that stuff to yourself.

563
00:35:33,634 --> 00:35:34,965
I mean, she laughed at you.

564
00:35:35,001 --> 00:35:37,098
That was the worst.

565
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:38,932
Why is that the worst?

566
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:40,298
Why?

567
00:35:40,334 --> 00:35:44,565
Well... because it
is. Trust me.

568
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,465
Now we've still got a
lot of work ahead of us.

569
00:35:47,501 --> 00:35:48,865
Who's this next to me?

570
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:50,265
Chuckie. He's my
best friend.

571
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,298
Who's this on
the other side?

572
00:35:51,334 --> 00:35:52,532
Heather johnson.

573
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,698
She's got a righteous crush on me.

574
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,298
Perfect. Now, my mom's
in the kitchen.

575
00:35:55,334 --> 00:35:56,632
Cruise through.
Say, gotta go.

576
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:58,298
Give my mom a kiss,
go out the door.

577
00:35:58,334 --> 00:35:59,899
Gotta go, kiss, out
the door. Got it?

578
00:35:59,934 --> 00:36:01,098
Got it.

579
00:36:01,134 --> 00:36:02,332
Hang it over one
shoulder.

580
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:09,365
Will, honey, i made sprout
muffins for breakfast.

581
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:12,298
Gotta go. Kiss.
Out the door.

582
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,032
What did you say?

583
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:18,532
Gotta go. Kiss.
Out the door.

584
00:36:22,067 --> 00:36:24,598
He's gotta be from a
different gene pool.

585
00:36:29,867 --> 00:36:33,265
Will! Hey, buddy.

586
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:35,632
Chuckie?

587
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:36,932
I mean, chuckie.

588
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:38,232
Hey, what happened
to you this weekend?

589
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:39,865
I called a few times but
you never called back.

590
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:41,665
What were you, busy?

591
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,132
Yeah, busy.

592
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,365
And now i feel like something's crawling in my stomach.

593
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:47,165
Did you eat
something bad?

594
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,999
No, i just feel strange.

595
00:36:49,034 --> 00:36:51,565
Nervous, excited.

596
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,165
You sure you're ok?

597
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,698
Sure, peak kicker
to the max.

598
00:36:57,434 --> 00:36:59,499
Ok, then.

599
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,399
So far, so good.

600
00:37:12,134 --> 00:37:13,665
This place looks great.

601
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,365
Why do i hate it
so much?

602
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:19,632
Maybe because you're constantly on
the verge of failing every subject.

603
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:22,432

Yeah, of course,

00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,499
but friends have to be
able to tell each other

648
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:42,999

00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,832
Someone said i was
in big trouble.

727
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:29,598
Not as big as the trouble
you're gonna be in

728
00:43:29,634 --> 00:43:31,165
when i get you alone
one of these days.

729
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,432
You're still mad about me getting you suspended.

730
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:36,399
But it wasn't right of you to steal my lunch money.

731
00:43:36,434 --> 00:43:37,865
What did you say?

732
00:43:37,901 --> 00:43:40,032
Although i shouldn't have been
afraid to talk to you myself.

733
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:41,865
Rather than telling
a teacher.

734
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:45,098
I mean, there's nothing
to be afraid of, right?

735
00:43:46,501 --> 00:43:48,932
Yeah. Right.

736
00:43:48,967 --> 00:43:50,565
I'm sorry.

been braver.

Dude, there's something
seriously wrong with you today.

739
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:59,465
So, what did you do
to get here?

740
00:43:59,501 --> 00:44:01,865
I started a riot in
the lunch room.

741
00:44:01,901 --> 00:44:03,499
That was you?

742
00:44:03,534 --> 00:44:06,565
I bet your old man's gonna
go medieval on you, huh?

Your father, stupid.

747
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:14,165
I mean, you do have a
father, right?

748
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,499
I don't really know what it means to have a father.

749
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:23,265
My dad left me and my
mom when i was two.

I don't really know what it
means to have a father, either.

a little more.

00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,965
I'm the one that does all
the work around here.

904
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:28,499
Fine. Go.

905
00:51:28,534 --> 00:51:30,565
Whatever.

906
00:51:31,934 --> 00:51:34,965
Look, will,
i thought staying home all day,

907
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:36,298
eating junk food,
watching television,

908
00:51:36,334 --> 00:51:38,032
and not going to school
was your dream.

909
00:51:40,501 --> 00:51:42,365
It was my dream.

910
00:51:42,401 --> 00:51:45,465
My dream stinks.

911
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,065
$200 for the ice
cream truck rental.

912
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,832
Fifty bucks for a
portable freezer.

913
00:52:04,867 --> 00:52:06,065
We weren't doing so bad.

914
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,532
We would have broken even in a couple of months.

915
00:52:07,567 --> 00:52:09,565
I didn't come here to
start a small business.

916
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,698
Not to mention the fact we
didn't get any spying done.

917
00:52:12,734 --> 00:52:15,198
Conrad, when hypercloning hits it big,

918
00:52:15,234 --> 00:52:18,298
we're gonna look back
at all this and laugh.

919
00:52:18,334 --> 00:52:20,598
My island we buy
with all that money.

920
00:52:20,634 --> 00:52:22,365
I want a little
ranch house,

921
00:52:22,401 --> 00:52:25,198
a picket fence, fluffy
white pillows.

922
00:52:25,234 --> 00:52:26,598
It's not
possible.

923
00:52:26,634 --> 00:52:27,598
Which part?

924
00:52:27,634 --> 00:52:28,965
Look, look, look, look.

925
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:30,432
Down on the driveway.

926
00:52:30,467 --> 00:52:32,465
What's up, man?

927
00:52:32,501 --> 00:52:33,932
Victor: the bedroom window.

928
00:52:33,967 --> 00:52:36,598
One there, one there.
Two of them!

929
00:52:36,634 --> 00:52:38,532
Two will brownings!

930
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,032
Both:
he's hypercloned himself!

931
00:52:43,634 --> 00:52:47,032
A human hyperclone!

932
00:52:47,067 --> 00:52:49,365
Conrad, do you know
what this means?

933
00:52:49,401 --> 00:52:52,265
If we grab hold of that
specimen and run some tests,

934
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:55,565
we'll be able to
hyperclone humans.

935
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,032
This is the greatest
day of our lives!

936
00:52:58,067 --> 00:53:00,165
Now all we have to do is figure out which will is will

937
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,465
and which will
is the clone.

938
00:53:01,501 --> 00:53:02,665
Why don't we just
grab them both?

939
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,899
No. That's kidnapping.

940
00:53:04,934 --> 00:53:07,499
Whereas, the last
time i checked,

941
00:53:07,534 --> 00:53:09,598
there were no laws
against clonenapping.

942
00:53:09,634 --> 00:53:12,265
So we wait until the
clone is alone.

943
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,665
Exactly.

944
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,032
We've still got three days.

945
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:22,899
You sure you want me
to do this?

946
00:53:22,934 --> 00:53:25,865
Hey, if you can hang out with my friends at the arcade,

947
00:53:25,901 --> 00:53:27,132
you can hang out with grandpa mordechai.

948
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,165
Besides, it's just for a couple of hours.

949
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,332
Just act more or less normal and you'll be fine.

950
00:53:31,367 --> 00:53:33,565
Grandpa mordechai
is your family.

951
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,065
Today he's all yours.

952
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,999
You'll love him. He's a
load of laughs.

953
00:53:42,234 --> 00:53:43,999
Is that what old
looks like?

954
00:53:44,034 --> 00:53:46,465
That's what very
old looks like.

955
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:49,698
All right,
let's just go watch television with mordechai.

956
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,999
Hi, dad.
Look who came to see you.

957
00:53:59,034 --> 00:54:01,499
Hi, mordechai.

958
00:54:01,534 --> 00:54:03,499
Hi, grandpa.

959
00:54:07,234 --> 00:54:09,332
Go on, dufus. Say hi.

960
00:54:26,501 --> 00:54:28,365
Does it hurt?

961
00:54:28,401 --> 00:54:31,265
Being old?

962
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,665
Not today.

963
00:54:59,367 --> 00:55:01,098
Will?

964
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,065
What took you so long?

965
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,899
Tell me you didn't
mess anything up.

966
00:55:05,934 --> 00:55:07,499
You were right about
grandpa mordechai.

967
00:55:07,534 --> 00:55:08,499
He's a lot of fun.

968
00:55:08,534 --> 00:55:09,565
We had a long talk.

969
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,298
Grandpa mordechai
doesn't talk to anyone.

970
00:55:11,334 --> 00:55:12,732
He talked to me.

971
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,832
[Knocking] will,
can we come in?

972
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,532
Oh, you changed
your clothes.

973
00:55:18,567 --> 00:55:19,965
Yes. Yes, i did.

974
00:55:20,001 --> 00:55:23,365
Honey, your dad and i
just wanted you to know

975
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:26,565
that that was the sweetest
thing you have ever done.

976
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,298
It meant so
much to me,

977
00:55:28,334 --> 00:55:29,732
you being nice
to grandpa.

978
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:31,932
You know how much
family means to me.

979
00:55:31,967 --> 00:55:36,665
Anyway, i just
wanted you to know

980
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,232
you are a very
special person.

981
00:55:39,267 --> 00:55:41,198
Don't you ever forget that.

982
00:55:43,134 --> 00:55:45,298
And i want you to know
that your mother and i

983
00:55:45,334 --> 00:55:46,798
are very impressed
with you lately.

984
00:55:46,834 --> 00:55:48,598
I mean, the changes
you've made at school,

985
00:55:48,634 --> 00:55:49,965
and your grades
are up,

986
00:55:50,001 --> 00:55:51,598
your attitude's
improved.

987
00:55:51,634 --> 00:55:53,232
It's like you're a
different kid.

988
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:55,765
I guess we got
through to you.

989
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,932
And since the changes
happened with you so fast,

990
00:55:58,967 --> 00:56:02,798
summer boot camp is not
an issue anymore.

991
00:56:02,834 --> 00:56:04,499
The summer is yours.

992
00:56:04,534 --> 00:56:06,065
Do anything you want.

993
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:09,065
Goof off, hang out
around with chuckie,

994
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,165
anything. You
deserve it.

995
00:56:13,967 --> 00:56:17,132
What if... the new me
was only temporary?

996
00:56:18,834 --> 00:56:20,665
What if i went back
to how i used to be?

997
00:56:22,634 --> 00:56:24,698
You'd still love me...

998
00:56:24,734 --> 00:56:26,032
right?

999
00:56:26,067 --> 00:56:30,198
Honey, loving you was
never the question.

1000
00:56:32,467 --> 00:56:36,065
C'mon, you knew
that, didn't you?

1001
00:56:37,534 --> 00:56:39,265
Huh?

1002
00:57:01,834 --> 00:57:03,198
Where do you think
you're going?

1003
00:57:03,234 --> 00:57:05,298
Um, to school?

1004
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:07,332
Not today. I'm going.

1005
00:57:07,367 --> 00:57:08,632
You're staying here.

1006
00:57:10,267 --> 00:57:12,432
Do not leave this room.

1007
00:57:12,467 --> 00:57:14,365
Uh, will...

1008
00:57:14,401 --> 00:57:16,265
maybe i should fill you in on what's going on in school.

1009
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,698
Things are a little
different now.

1010
00:57:17,734 --> 00:57:19,399
You know, with your
friends and everything.

1011
00:57:19,434 --> 00:57:23,265
I think i can figure out how to talk
to my friends in my school, ok?

1012
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,265
Ok.

1013
00:57:28,867 --> 00:57:30,232
The nerve of that guy.

1014
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:33,065
"Maybe i should fill you
in on what's going on."

1015
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:36,999
Please.
Looks like his clone head is getting a little swelled.

1016
00:57:37,034 --> 00:57:38,198
Hey, there's
will!

1017
00:57:38,234 --> 00:57:40,065
What's going on, will?

1018
00:57:43,567 --> 00:57:45,198
Hi, will.

1019
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,098
Hi.

1020
00:57:55,234 --> 00:57:56,965
My friends, my life.

1021
00:57:57,001 --> 00:57:59,932
Hi, will.
Thanks so much for helping me rearrange my room.

1022
00:57:59,967 --> 00:58:02,165
It was so nice of
you to stay late.

1023
00:58:04,434 --> 00:58:06,598
This is my school, not his.

1024
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,298
Will!

1025
00:58:10,934 --> 00:58:14,032
Chuckie, did i really
stay after school

1026
00:58:14,067 --> 00:58:15,832
and help miss pinkerson
move her furniture?

1027
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,932
Don't you remember?

1028
00:58:17,967 --> 00:58:19,865
Sure, i do.

1029
00:58:19,901 --> 00:58:21,832
I just don't
remember why.

1030
00:58:21,867 --> 00:58:23,298
Why?

1031
00:58:23,334 --> 00:58:25,098
'Cause it's you, man.

1032
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:27,532
You give. You're always
up for new things.

1033
00:58:27,567 --> 00:58:31,032
In these last couple of weeks
you've become pretty, ah...

1034
00:58:31,067 --> 00:58:32,865
i guess the word i'm
lookin' for is popular.

1035
00:58:32,901 --> 00:58:34,465
Yeah. Right.

1036
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:37,465
Will, my man.
My mom scored some tickets to sunday's ball game.

1037
00:58:37,501 --> 00:58:38,365
Right behind home plate.

1038
00:58:38,401 --> 00:58:40,132
Wanna come?

1039
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:41,165
Sure.

1040
00:58:41,901 --> 00:58:42,999
Hey!

1041
00:58:43,034 --> 00:58:44,832
Looks like you have
some cleaning up to do.

1042
00:58:44,867 --> 00:58:46,465
But it was an accident.

1043
00:58:46,501 --> 00:58:48,032
Grip it, punk. And pick it up.

1044
00:58:48,067 --> 00:58:49,765
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

1045
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:54,665
Thanks, buddy.

1046
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:58,165
So, think about the game.
We'll talk about it at lunch.

1047
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,865
Save your seat?

1048
00:58:59,901 --> 00:59:00,999
Thanks.

1049
00:59:01,034 --> 00:59:03,899
Cool. See you later.
You too, dude.

1050
00:59:06,034 --> 00:59:09,165
Will? You ok?

1051
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:12,165
What time do you want
to meet tonight?

1052
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,298
Tonight?

1053
00:59:13,334 --> 00:59:15,098
The junior social,

1054
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,565
remember, silly?

1055
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,965
No, heather, i
forgot. Duh.

1056
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:20,798
How's 7:00?

1057
00:59:20,834 --> 00:59:23,165
I wanna be there early--
so we can talk and stuff.

1058
00:59:24,401 --> 00:59:25,632
It's settled then.

1059
00:59:25,667 --> 00:59:26,832
7:00 in the gym.

1060
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:29,265
See ya later, william.

1061
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,632
I'll see ya... william.

1062
00:59:40,167 --> 00:59:41,698
Oh, man.

1063
00:59:42,767 --> 00:59:44,565
What happened to my life?

1064
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,298
Twoie?

1065
00:59:57,334 --> 00:59:59,132
Tell me you're in here.

1066
01:00:00,234 --> 01:00:02,032
I realized you were
making very poor use

1067
01:00:02,067 --> 01:00:03,732
of your available shelf
and closet space,

1068
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,632
so i increased the total
storage capacity of your room

1069
01:00:05,667 --> 01:00:07,598
by 12.4 cubic feet.

1070
01:00:07,634 --> 01:00:08,965
Want to see the chart?

1071
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,198
No.

1072
01:00:11,234 --> 01:00:12,798
Thanks.

1073
01:00:15,067 --> 01:00:16,065
You're mad.

1074
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,732
Wow. You're absolutely
brilliant.

1075
01:00:17,767 --> 01:00:19,298
You sure you
have my genes?

1076
01:00:19,334 --> 01:00:20,832
Every last one
of 'em.

1077
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:21,932
Then how come
you get "a"s?

1078
01:00:21,967 --> 01:00:23,932

1255
01:11:57,067 --> 01:11:58,032
Where?

1256
01:11:58,067 --> 01:11:59,632
Over there. Twelve
o'clock high.

1257
01:12:08,667 --> 01:12:10,532
This way.

1258
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:14,865
Hey, will.

1259
01:12:14,901 --> 01:12:16,298
You're not in the bathroom.

1260
01:12:16,334 --> 01:12:18,198
I mean, <i>he's</i> not in there.

1261
01:12:18,234 --> 01:12:19,298
I mean, what do i mean?

1262
01:12:19,334 --> 01:12:20,598
Wait a second.

1263
01:12:20,634 --> 01:12:22,165
What are you doing?

1264
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,732
Sometimes we can communicate psychically.

1265
01:12:24,767 --> 01:12:27,032
You know. We can hear
each other's thoughts.

1266
01:12:27,067 --> 01:12:29,198
If one of us is really
stressed or something.

1267
01:12:30,367 --> 01:12:32,698
Shoot! Nothing.

1268
01:12:32,734 --> 01:12:34,965
That's it. You're making
all this up. I know it.

1269
01:12:35,001 --> 01:12:36,899
Chuckie, you've
gotta trust me!

1270
01:12:36,934 --> 01:12:38,932
Look in the gym.
Then go to my house.

1271
01:12:38,967 --> 01:12:41,132
You take the shortcut.
I'll take the long way.

1272
01:12:41,167 --> 01:12:43,332
That way if he's
out there...

1273
01:12:43,367 --> 01:12:45,165
...one of us
will find him.

1274
01:12:46,567 --> 01:12:49,332
This is one heck of
a junior social.

1275
01:12:53,534 --> 01:12:54,499
Hey!

1276
01:12:54,534 --> 01:12:55,832
Gotcha!

1277
01:12:55,867 --> 01:12:57,798
Hello, my little
hyperclone.

1278
01:12:57,834 --> 01:13:00,232
Lemme-- lemme go!

1279

01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,298
Help! Help! Help!

1282
01:13:16,334 --> 01:13:17,499
Hold 'em, man.

1283
01:13:17,534 --> 01:13:18,598
I've got 'em.

1284
01:13:18,634 --> 01:13:19,765
Lemme go!

1285
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,165
Let's go, kid.

1286
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,965
Hey. While i'm young.

1287
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,565
Hyper little hyperclone,
aren't you?

1288
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,732
Let's get some dna.

1289
01:13:35,767 --> 01:13:37,165
What are you guys,
crazy? Let me go!

1290
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,265
No, my little atm card,
we're not crazy.

1291
01:13:40,300 --> 01:13:42,832
But thanks to you, we're
gonna be very rich.

1292
01:13:44,334 --> 01:13:46,532
No! You'll be in jail!
This is kidnapping!

1293
01:13:47,667 --> 01:13:48,598
Uh-ah.

1294
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,899
Clonenapping.

1295
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,332
You think i'm
twoie, don't you?

1296
01:13:56,367 --> 01:13:58,032
Yeah, well, you got
the wrong one!

1297
01:13:58,067 --> 01:13:59,365
I'm the real will.

1298
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,932
Yeah! All right now.

1299
01:14:01,967 --> 01:14:03,598
If you'll let me go right now, i
won't tell anyone about you, ok?

1300
01:14:06,134 --> 01:14:08,365
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

1301
01:14:08,401 --> 01:14:09,399
Yeah.

1302
01:14:10,667 --> 01:14:12,432
What if he's
telling the truth?

1303
01:14:12,467 --> 01:14:15,165
If we give a normal kid the serum,
no telling what might happen.

1304
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,399
I think we have to
get the other one.

1305
01:14:16,434 --> 01:14:17,565
Run some tests.

1306
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,032
That's the only way
we can be sure.

1307
01:14:19,067 --> 01:14:20,098
Oh, yeah.

1308
01:14:20,134 --> 01:14:21,532
Check the ropes. Gotta
keep this one here.

1309
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,598
Ok.

1310
01:14:26,167 --> 01:14:27,298
Don't go away.

1311
01:14:52,134 --> 01:14:53,932
Help! Somebody, help me!

1312
01:14:53,967 --> 01:14:56,698
Big trouble. I'm in big trouble.

1313
01:14:56,734 --> 01:14:58,298
If i ever get outta here, i--

1314
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,432
twoie was right.

1315
01:15:00,467 --> 01:15:01,999
What was i waiting for?

1316
01:15:02,034 --> 01:15:04,598
Now i'll never get a chance to dance,
or see chuckie or heather, even.

1317
01:15:04,634 --> 01:15:06,565
Or allana, or mom and dad.

1318
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:07,999
I love my mom and dad.

1319
01:15:09,001 --> 01:15:11,999
I can't believe it.
I miss my family.

1320
01:15:12,034 --> 01:15:12,598
Tell me about it.

1321
01:15:12,634 --> 01:15:13,532
Twoie!

1322
01:15:13,567 --> 01:15:14,999
In the flesh.

1323
01:15:15,034 --> 01:15:17,198
I was at the bus station,
and i knew you were scared.

1324
01:15:17,234 --> 01:15:19,465
And then the name red jack
motors flashed in my head.

1325
01:15:19,501 --> 01:15:20,565
You came back for me.

1326
01:15:21,534 --> 01:15:22,732
Why are you so surprised?

1327
01:15:22,767 --> 01:15:24,098
You should be mad at me.

1328
01:15:24,134 --> 01:15:26,032
Will, if it wasn't for you,

1329
01:15:26,067 --> 01:15:28,198
i wouldn't have
ever tasted pizza.

1330
01:15:29,967 --> 01:15:30,965
I owe you one.

1331
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:32,865
Twoie, i gotta tell
you something.

1332
01:15:32,901 --> 01:15:34,698
If you don't drink
some special liquid

1333
01:15:34,734 --> 01:15:36,132
those creeps in
the van have,

1334
01:15:36,167 --> 01:15:38,765
you might turn back
into ocean pup eggs.

1335
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,698
That's why i've been
feeling so weird.

1336
01:15:40,734 --> 01:15:42,298
We've gotta get it
back from them.

1337
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:45,332
Well, that was stupid, conrad.

1338
01:15:45,867 --> 01:15:46,965
Come on!

1339
01:15:50,534 --> 01:15:52,432
"We don't need gas," you said.

1340
01:15:54,001 --> 01:15:56,532
"It runs for three miles
on empty," you said.

1341
01:16:00,367 --> 01:16:01,532
He's gone.

1342
01:16:01,567 --> 01:16:04,365
All right. He's
gotta be in here.

1343
01:16:04,401 --> 01:16:05,132
No way out.

1344
01:16:05,167 --> 01:16:06,098
Right.

1345
01:16:19,534 --> 01:16:20,832
[Whistles]

1346
01:16:28,934 --> 01:16:30,232
we better split up.

1347
01:16:39,034 --> 01:16:39,965
Come on!

1348
01:17:30,001 --> 01:17:31,465
Well, well, well.

1349
01:17:33,034 --> 01:17:35,698
Looks like we finally
got our hyperclone.

1350
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,465
I'm will.

1351
01:17:38,501 --> 01:17:39,465
We switched clothes.

1352
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:42,632
I don't think so.

1353
01:17:46,001 --> 01:17:47,532
You don't need to be afraid.

1354
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,732
We've got your best
interest at heart.

1355
01:17:51,934 --> 01:17:53,365
You need us.

1356
01:17:55,334 --> 01:17:57,132
See, without this--

1357
01:17:57,167 --> 01:18:00,865
you'll be nothin' but...
cheap caviar.

1358
01:18:02,434 --> 01:18:05,832
It's already started. You
can see it in your face.

1359
01:18:16,834 --> 01:18:18,865
What are you gonna do with that?

1360
01:18:18,901 --> 01:18:21,098
Oh. Oh!

1361
01:18:21,134 --> 01:18:23,265
Ooh! You got me.

Ow!

Aaahhhh!

Get me a parachute, boys.

1369
01:19:48,034 --> 01:19:49,732
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

1370
01:19:51,501 --> 01:19:52,098
Aahhhh!

1371
01:19:53,367 --> 01:19:54,365
Ow!

Twoie! Let him go!
I'll call the police!

What are you
gonna do? Huh?

1383
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,165
Tell the police that the bad
men stole your hyperclone?

1384

believe ya?

you running forever.

You do want to
live, don't you?

1390
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:14,165
Why? So you can
experiment on me?

1391
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,032
Why shouldn't we experiment
on you? We created you!

1392
01:21:16,067 --> 01:21:19,332
Do you have any idea how many years
we slaved to make you possible?

1393
01:21:21,067 --> 01:21:22,098
Hold him still.

1394
01:21:22,134 --> 01:21:23,632

How did you guys
know to come here?

1416
01:22:44,234 --> 01:22:46,098
I stopped by the
school on my way here,

1417
01:22:46,134 --> 01:22:47,365
and i told them to get help.

1418

Ok. This doesn't
concern you children.

01:23:34,967 --> 01:23:35,865
That's our clone in there!

1433
01:23:38,334 --> 01:23:40,332
Remember that science
project i was working on?

1434
01:23:40,367 --> 01:23:42,432
Yeah, well, he's it.

1435
01:23:43,501 --> 01:23:45,432
I'll explain everything
at home, but please,

1436
01:23:45,467 --> 01:23:48,165
you guys gotta cover for us.

1437
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,432
Please?

1438
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:54,665
Look, i know this is gonna sound
like a bit of a crazy question,

1439
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:56,165
but, ah...

1440
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,499
you two...

1441
01:23:57,534 --> 01:23:59,832
are... cousins.
Identical cousins.

1442
01:23:59,867 --> 01:24:02,198
I'm will, and this is...

1443
01:24:02,234 --> 01:24:03,165

1444
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,098
Gill.

1445
01:24:04,134 --> 01:24:05,532
Uhh, pupman.

1446
01:24:06,767 --> 01:24:08,098
We're cousins like he said.

1447
01:24:08,134 --> 01:24:10,465
I'm from belgium.

1448
01:24:10,501 --> 01:24:11,665
Cousins?

1449
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:13,065
Yep. Cousins.

1450
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:14,965
Identical.

1451
01:24:15,001 --> 01:24:16,098
Belgium.

1452
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:18,999
They're clones! Identical
genetic subjects!

1453
01:24:19,034 --> 01:24:19,665
Yeah.

1454
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:20,932
Every cell's the same!

1455
01:24:20,967 --> 01:24:23,198
Officer, that man's crazy.

1456
01:24:23,734 --> 01:24:24,698
We made him!

1457
01:24:24,734 --> 01:24:25,999
Outta nothin'!

1458
01:24:26,034 --> 01:24:27,532
Yeah, yeah.

1459
01:24:27,567 --> 01:24:29,232
Clones? We're cousins.

1460
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:34,265
Never could tell them apart.

1461
01:24:36,634 --> 01:24:38,698
Right, mom? Dad?

1462
01:24:40,334 --> 01:24:43,298
Well, ok,
but we're gonna have to take some statements.

1463
01:24:43,334 --> 01:24:46,032
Eh... tomorrow.

1464
01:24:47,234 --> 01:24:50,232
The, um, cousins have
been through enough.

1465
01:24:50,267 --> 01:24:51,098
But...

1466
01:24:51,134 --> 01:24:52,932
uh... tomorrow.

1467
01:24:57,434 --> 01:24:58,798
Gill,

1468
01:24:58,834 --> 01:25:00,899
let's go home.

1469
01:25:03,501 --> 01:25:07,732
Will, i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.

1470
01:25:10,967 --> 01:25:13,399
So, this whole time he's
been living in my room,

1471
01:25:13,434 --> 01:25:15,198
doing my homework and stuff.

1472
01:25:15,234 --> 01:25:17,632
But the weird thing is,

1473
01:25:17,667 --> 01:25:19,832
he changed me.

1474
01:25:19,867 --> 01:25:21,932
Even while he was being me.

1475
01:25:22,934 --> 01:25:28,065
I-i-am very confused.
I am so confused.

1476
01:25:29,934 --> 01:25:31,165
So...

1477
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:33,132
can gill stay?

1478
01:25:35,834 --> 01:25:37,598
What do you want, gill?

1479
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:41,232
A family.

1480
01:25:46,967 --> 01:25:50,732
Well, as long as you're
living under this roof,

1481
01:25:50,767 --> 01:25:53,665
you're going to have to maintain
those excellent grades.

1482
01:25:54,334 --> 01:25:55,899
This is cool.

1483
01:25:55,934 --> 01:25:58,665
Weird. But cool.

1484
01:25:58,700 --> 01:26:01,598
Ahh, but we tell no one.

1485
01:26:01,634 --> 01:26:04,632
Ahh, gill is a cousin
who now lives with us.

1486
01:26:04,667 --> 01:26:05,732
Right?

1487
01:26:05,767 --> 01:26:08,565
An identical cousin.

1488
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:12,999
Anyone who says any different...

1489
01:26:13,034 --> 01:26:14,399
will have to deal with me.

1490
01:26:17,534 --> 01:26:20,732
Well, ok. It's settled then.

1491
01:26:20,767 --> 01:26:23,132
Welcome to the
family, gill.

1492
01:26:23,167 --> 01:26:26,632
Just don't go taking twice as
much time in the bathroom.

1493
01:26:26,667 --> 01:26:28,765
Ok, then.
I'm hungry!

1494
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,932
And i don't want anything with tree bark.

1495
01:26:34,267 --> 01:26:35,465
Pizza?

1496
01:26:35,501 --> 01:26:37,298
Pizza!

1497
01:26:37,334 --> 01:26:39,465
Pizza.

1498
01:26:39,501 --> 01:26:41,365
Yes.
