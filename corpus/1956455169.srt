1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,833
(crashing gong)

2
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:10,933
(haunting eastern flute melody)

3
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,533
(bubbling brook)

4
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,500
(speaking in foreign language)

5
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:27,633
(breathy yawn)

6
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:35,533
- He'll show.

7
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,967
Yamata can't do business
here without Yakuza approval.

8
00:02:38,967 --> 00:02:41,733
- Let's just wrap it up, we've
been watching for three days.

9
00:02:41,733 --> 00:02:44,533
- I've been watching,
you've been eating.

10
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:47,533
- I'm not really hungry
you know, I'm horny.

11
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:51,700
I spend more nights with
you than I do with my wife.

12
00:03:27,167 --> 00:03:30,600
-  You better
go call for backup.

13
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:38,333
- Yes Mother, I'll
wait this time.

14
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:42,267
(speaking in foreign language)

15
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:52,133
(fearsome grunt)

16
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,567
(pained cry)

17
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:59,900
(intense grunts)

18
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:17,467
(anguished shout)

19
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,500
(battle cries)

20
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,033
(hard thud)

21
00:04:57,867 --> 00:05:00,700
(frustrated grunt)

22
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:14,433
(brawling yells)

23
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:31,367
(breaking crunch)

24
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,767
(whipping thunks)

25
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,200
(fearful murmur)

26
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,867
(grinding snap)

27
00:05:58,833 --> 00:06:01,600
(growling exhale)

28
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:05,333
(howling battle)

29
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:33,300
(ringing steel)

30
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:46,300
(painful yowl)

31
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,900
(pained cries)

32
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:05,433
(whispering metal)

33
00:07:05,433 --> 00:07:09,333
(speaking in foreign language)

34
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:13,200
(pinging gunshot)

35
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:24,900
(speaking in foreign language)

36
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,733
(somber chanting)

37
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:35,467
- Mitara Hoshino, watch.

38
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,233
Watch and see what I can do.

39
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:47,333
First the head will swim,

40
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,633
then the sweats and the pain,

41
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:55,667
then he will die.

42
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,633
There is nothing you can do.

43
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,533
(whipping thump)

44
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:05,167
(ringing lasers)

45
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,933
(distant sirens)

46
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:30,000
(speaking in foreign language)

47
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,733
(choking gurgle)

48
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:35,500
- Thomas?

49
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,400
(speaking in foreign language)

50
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,367
(chirping birds)

51
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,667
-  Councilman Royce,
do you have anything to say

52
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:41,300
to those responsible for
the death of Father Munoz?

53
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,267
- Congratulations, you have
just made the top of my list,

54
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:47,033
and we will find you.

55
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:50,467
- Karen, hi.

56
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,867
- Another drive by?

57
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:54,367
- You didn't hear?

58
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,733
-  Oh my god.

59
00:09:57,733 --> 00:09:58,833
- Listen Karen,
I'm really sorry.

60
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,200
I heard he was a
friend of yours.

61
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,800
- Mine and about a thousand
kids he saved from the streets.

62
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,733
Father Munoz is the only
reason we don't have

63
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:10,000
a full-scale gang
war on our hands.

64
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,533
He kept the lid on.

65
00:10:11,533 --> 00:10:13,533
- Well the lid's off now.

66
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:15,400
Eyewitness saw
three black males,

67
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,367
all dressed in purple and black.

68
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,500
- Icemen, Jesus.

69
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,267
- Mm-Hm, must've wanted
it advertised too.

70
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:24,400
You wear anything but
orange on Malitos turf,

71
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,267
you might as well have
a target on your back.

72
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:30,767
Check this out, machine
gun, NATO caliber.

73
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,633
- Where the hell did Icemen
get this kind of hardware?

74
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:39,533
(speaking in foreign language)

75
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:43,400
- Listen to me, when
I ask a question,

76
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,100
you answer you lying spic fuck.

77
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:46,933
- Wait.

78
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
My favorite ex-partner.

79
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,567
- Let him go.

80
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,900
- Sure, hold hands with him.

81
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,267
(speaking in foreign language)

82
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:02,000
You'll see me again beaner.

83
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,533
- Yeah, next time grow
some hair on your head

84
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:05,500
so I can figure out
which end is your ass.

85
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,933
(assorted chuckling)

86
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,167
- Ray, show a little class.

87
00:11:10,567 --> 00:11:13,133
- I got somethin' else I
wanna show you, sweetcakes.

88
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:14,667
- Oh really?

89
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:17,533
You wanna show me
your penis, Ray?

90
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:18,800
Is that it?

91
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,833
Is that what it's gonna
take to make you happy?

92
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:22,633
Well go ahead, whip
that bad boy out here.

93
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:24,733
Just give me a second.

94
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:27,800
Damn, left my magnifying
glass at home.

95
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,967
Let us handle this Hector.

96
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:35,733
- Sorry detective,
Malitos got rules.

97
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,867
Ten of them for one of us.

98
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:41,400
- The Malitos also have a treaty

99
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,333
with the 72nd street Icemen.

100
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,067
- Yeah, well that treaty
just left in a body bag.

101
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:49,233
- You're a leader Hector, think
of the rest of these people.

102
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:51,900
- We can take care of ourselves.

103
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:55,733
- Rita, come with me please.

104
00:11:55,733 --> 00:11:56,567
Please?

105
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:03,233
Look, what happened
to Father Munoz

106
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:06,667
want that to happen
a hundred times that?

107
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:12,100
You told me once that
you wanted a fresh start.

108
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,933
Hector listens to you.

109
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,300
I need you to buy me some time

110
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,900
so I can find out who did this.

111
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,433
Please.

112
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,467
- Father Fernando
Munoz lost his life

113
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:29,700
in a hail of machine gun fire.

114
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,367
The priest gained media
attention when he forged

115
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:35,467
a truce between the
Malitos and the Icemen,

116
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:38,367
two of the city's most
violent street gangs.

117
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:40,733
Last weekend, that
truce was shattered

118
00:12:40,733 --> 00:12:43,267
with the drive-by shooting
that took the life

119
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:44,867
of James Hobbs, 19.

120
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:49,933
Ironically, Hobbs funeral
was just held today.

121
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:54,300
(soft sobs)

122
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,633
(foreboding music)

123
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,933
(low chanting)

124
00:13:59,933 --> 00:14:02,867
(rumbling traffic)

125
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,300
(hysterical screams)

126
00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:33,133
(angry grunt)

127
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:42,367
-  LAPD, right?

128
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:43,367
- $100 even.

129
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:45,733
- For a ride from the airport?

130
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,500
- Next time take bus.

131
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,933
-  All I got's yen.

132
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,567
- What's this? American joke?

133
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:54,767
- My flight was late,

134
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:56,233
I didn't have time
to exchange my money.

135
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:59,667
- Sure, I haven't heard that
one for almost one week.

136
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:00,867
C'mon, you pay.

137
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,167
Hey, you pay.

138
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:08,067
(speaking in foreign language)

139
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,667
C'mon, you pay.

140
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:15,600
- Follow that car,
this is an emergency.

141
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,167
- This is emergency.

142
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,900
- I'll get you the
money, just go.

143
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,833
- You pay, or I'll call cops.

144
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,067
- Listen to me
asshole, I am a cop.

145
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:24,867
Now follow that damn car.

146
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:26,367
- Okay.

147
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:29,300
(screeching tires)

148
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,300
- I'm not scared
of you Godzilla,

149
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,600
I've seen all your movies.

150
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,333
(snarky chuckle)

151
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,233
Right there.

152
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:53,067
- ID, ID.

153
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,367
- What is this, I
don't read Martian?

154
00:16:05,367 --> 00:16:06,800
Speak English?

155
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,633
Eng-rish?

156
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:11,567
- Eng-rish is not one of
my favorite languages,

157
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:14,200
but I speak it reasonably well.

158
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,567
Thomas Hoshino, Kyoto Police.

159
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:20,033
I'm here to take
Yamata back to Japan.

160
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:22,100
- All by yourself?

161
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,833
Your friend here
just busted up a bar

162
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,567
and three cops in
Japtown last week.

163
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:28,033
Now the feds want to see him,

164
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:29,433
your people want
him back in Japan

165
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:31,833
they can have him
teriyakied for all I care,

166
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,433
but not until tomorrow.

167
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:35,500
- I need to talk to him.

168
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,333
- Sorry.

169
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:42,767
- He's one of the men
who killed my partner.

170
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:45,200
- Alright, you can
ride up with us.

171
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,533
But keep your hands off him.

172
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,667
(soft chuckle)

173
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,933
- Hey, why is it Japanese
always sounds like

174
00:17:04,933 --> 00:17:06,767
worn-out transmission?

175
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,767
- Where's your partner?

176
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:13,200
The one who does
your killing for you?

177
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,533
- Let me propose a
business arrangement.

178
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,967
- You talk to me
now, or I set you up.

179
00:17:27,033 --> 00:17:28,500
I'll send you gifts in prison.

180
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,333
You'll receive
special privileges.

181
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,433
- Your associates
will be arrested.

182
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,700
- Hey, hey, hey-hey.

183
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:01,767
- You have until we leave.

184
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:02,600
(malicious chuckle)

185
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,567
- Sayonara.

186
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:04,567
- Yeah.

187
00:18:04,567 --> 00:18:05,567
- Thank you.

188
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:11,500
(pained groans)

189
00:18:17,533 --> 00:18:19,767
- This sucker's dead.

190
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,700
- You can't die now
you son-of-a-bitch.

191
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,500
- What the hell
did you say to him?

192
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,533
- I told him I
would dishonor him.

193
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:31,700
- Well, sure, that's enough
to give anyone a heart attack.

194
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:36,267
Get in.

195
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:38,867
C'mon.

196
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,800
- You've been much
too kind already.

197
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,567
- You should see me when I
really turn on the charm.

198
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:47,467
Look, the captain says I
have to keep an eye on you

199
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:49,300
until you leave town.

200
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,700
It's official, so can
I take you to a hotel?

201
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,633
- I have to go somewhere
first if you don't mind.

202
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:57,333
- Why not, only other
thing I have to worry about

203
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:58,333
is gang war.

204
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,267
- This car is huge.

205
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:10,867
- It's what God
meant cars to be,

206
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:13,900
till you guys came along
and screwed it all up.

207
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,633
-  Low quality and
lack of reinvestment ruined

208
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,333
the American auto industry.

209
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,267
-  Oh yeah?

210
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:19,100
-  Yes.

211
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,600
-  Oh yeah?

212
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,800
(squawking brakes)

213
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,433
Not bad.

214
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:46,467
This is your partner's uncle's?

215
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:47,300
- Yes.

216
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:55,167
Buntoro Iga was my
teacher for several years.

217
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,100
Now I was just a boy then, but,

218
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,500
I remember him as a
very traditional man.

219
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,000
- Don't worry toots,
I'll mind my manners.

220
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:06,600
- You must understand he
spent most of his life

221
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,200
as a Shinto priest.

222
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:13,533
(bubbly doo-wop music)

223
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:15,700
(speaking in foreign language)

224
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,933
- Thomas!

225
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:19,100
(joyful shouting)

226
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,867
I'd know you anywhere.

227
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:23,933
You've grown into
a fine, strong man.

228
00:20:25,633 --> 00:20:27,000
Ooh, and this?

229
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,267
- Oh, Ryder, Karen
Ryder, detective.

230
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:34,167
- A detective? A
beautiful detective.

231
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,933
How fascinating.

232
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:38,633
Don't tell me, let me guess.

233
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:41,000
English and French.

234
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,400
- How did you know?

235
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,500
- The eyes,
cheekbones, exquisite.

236
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:49,667
Hey, how 'bout some drinks,
scotch, rye, bourbon, wine?

237
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,733
I have quite a collection.

238
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:53,667
- I bet.

239
00:20:53,667 --> 00:20:54,933
- Thomas?

240
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:56,900
- Perhaps some tea, Igasan.

241
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,400
I've come on a very
serious errand.

242
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,567
- Patience, we will
cross at the ford.

243
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:06,267
- Musashi, you read that to me.

244
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:07,667
- Ah yes.

245
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:12,133
But I was thinking of
John Wayne, Red River?

246
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:13,800
Wonderful film.

247
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,100
You will stay for
dinner, won't you?

248
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,300
- Oh, I have to go back--

249
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,767
- Good, good.

250
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:22,633
You haven't lived till you
have tasted Fettuccine Buntoro.

251
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:24,400
Excuse me one moment,

252
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,600
Katie? Marico?

253
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,867
Rum punch for our guests.

254
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:32,433
- This is the part where
we cut our stomachs open?

255
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:36,100
- Marico and Katie are
my executive assistants.

256
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,100
I couldn't run
business without them.

257
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,000
- Business?

258
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:42,667
Oh, well Hoshino told me
that you were a priest.

259
00:21:42,667 --> 00:21:43,667
- Oh, I was.

260
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:47,100
I was! Ladies, drinks.

261
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:53,467
And then, one evening,
I was meditating...

262
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:58,500
You know what satori is Karen?

263
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,933
- Sure, there's a
great little satori bar

264
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:02,567
down the street
from my apartment.

265
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:05,767
(boisterous laughter)

266
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:06,833
- Good, good.

267
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,667
But, my satori is the
truth behind all truth.

268
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:19,233
I sense the pressure
society puts on us to take.

269
00:22:20,933 --> 00:22:22,667
My mission was clear.

270
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:27,967
Help others fulfill the
universal human need to give.

271
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:33,433
I decided to help
the wealthy first.

272
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:41,667
They give $500 and up for
these in Beverly Hills.

273
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,500
Authentic Chinese warrior.

274
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,467
Turn 'em out on a
computerized machine

275
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:56,000
in Little Tokyo for what,
twelve bucks a piece.

276
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,767
- Why you old bandit.

277
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,867
Oh, I love birds.

278
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:02,200
What's his name?

279
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,733
- Rasputin.

280
00:23:03,733 --> 00:23:04,567
- Oh.

281
00:23:04,567 --> 00:23:06,500
- I think he likes you.

282
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:08,400
Now.

283
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:12,800
- Igasan,

284
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,900
I have dishonored your family

285
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,800
and myself.

286
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,200
I came here

287
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,967
for the men who killed Yuji,

288
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:25,067
but I failed.

289
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,600
- There is no dishonor
in a true heart, Thomas.

290
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,767
Was Yuji a good policeman?

291
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:38,900
- He was the best, always.

292
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,667
I depended on his strength.

293
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,867
And sometimes, he made me laugh.

294
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,000
(speaking in foreign language)

295
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:55,900
- Kampai.

296
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,633
I will avenge his death.

297
00:23:58,633 --> 00:24:02,733
- Was there something strange
about the way Yuji died?

298
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,300
- There was a man,

299
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,667
an assassin who
worked for Yamata.

300
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:14,333
He raised a kind of
power that I could feel.

301
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,533
He barely touched Yuji.

302
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:22,133
- Check it out, check it out.

303
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:31,033
- I misjudged, Yamata didn't
want Yakuza permission.

304
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:34,433
He meant to take over the
entire local operation.

305
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:36,800
- So what was he doing here?

306
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,000
- Maybe hiding, or looking
for money to finance

307
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,500
his move in Japan.

308
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:49,400
(choking groan)

309
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,500
- This man, Yamata,

310
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,400
he simply fell dead
in the hallway?

311
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,033
There was no violence?

312
00:24:58,033 --> 00:24:58,833
- None.

313
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:03,867
- I have to see the body.

314
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:06,700
(heavy breathing)

315
00:25:22,533 --> 00:25:24,367
-  You can't just
walk into the morgue.

316
00:25:24,367 --> 00:25:26,133
-  Trust me.

317
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,933
(low chanting)

318
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:36,133
(speaking in foreign language)

319
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:40,933
- Holy shit.

320
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:45,033
- Just let me do the talking.

321
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:49,167
(key tones)

322
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:50,567
LAPD could we please
have an attendant

323
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,933
at the records desk.

324
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:54,500
- Right here, shot.

325
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,000
- Hi, this is
Detective Karen Ryder,

326
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,700
officer needs assistance.

327
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,200
I'm at the morgue.

328
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,000
- He was here.

329
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,900
He is here.

330
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:12,267
- You don't carry a badge,
you don't carry a gun,

331
00:26:12,267 --> 00:26:13,667
stay put Hoshino.

332
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,200
(dark orchestral music)

333
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:53,967
Icemen.

334
00:26:53,967 --> 00:26:54,800
- What?

335
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,633
- Their gang colors.

336
00:26:56,633 --> 00:26:58,667
Why would the Icemen do this?

337
00:26:58,667 --> 00:27:00,600
(crashing door)

338
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,433
Hoshino!

339
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,333
Hoshino get down!

340
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:13,367
(grunting skirmish)

341
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:31,733
(distant sirens)

342
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,300
Five years on the force and
I never had to shoot anyone.

343
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,533
-  Good.

344
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,100
- So this character
can resurrect people,

345
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,433
bring them back to life?

346
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:45,000
- No.

347
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,833
Yamata's death
was not a reality,

348
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,667
but an illusion
created by a blow

349
00:27:50,667 --> 00:27:53,267
purposely wide of the mark.

350
00:27:53,267 --> 00:27:55,767
It is said that some
truly gifted healers

351
00:27:55,767 --> 00:27:57,200
can restore life.

352
00:27:58,233 --> 00:27:59,867
But the man you saw tonight

353
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:01,667
was not a healer.

354
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:04,200
He is someone who has
surrendered himself

355
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,800
to the dark powers.

356
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:10,333
Your assassin is a master
of the Death Touch.

357
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,067
- I always thought
that was just a myth.

358
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:14,233
- Oh the death touch is real.

359
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:17,567
It's the opposite of the
ancient healing arts.

360
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:19,033
An assassin like this one

361
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:22,267
can apply Chi energy
with a mere touch.

362
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,267
He can cause death,
or illness now,

363
00:28:26,267 --> 00:28:28,167
or weeks in the future.

364
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:30,300
- This is nuts.

365
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,367
- I'm gonna put him away.

366
00:28:33,367 --> 00:28:37,333
- I've already lost a nephew
to this assassin Thomas,

367
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:39,200
now I've seen him.

368
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,133
He's your opposite,
your mirror image.

369
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:46,967
The legends say there is a
creature like him in every age.

370
00:28:46,967 --> 00:28:48,633
The essence of evil.

371
00:28:49,533 --> 00:28:52,167
He's the deadliest man alive.

372
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:54,267
- Of course, I understand.

373
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:57,067
First your prisoner
dies, then he escapes.

374
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:58,067
That's easy.

375
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:02,133
What I don't understand
is how you two could take

376
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:03,700
a simple extradition and turn it

377
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,700
into Pearl fucking Harbor.

378
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,333
- This is my responsibility,
I'll handle the situation.

379
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:11,833
- Wrong Akita, you don't
handle anything in my town.

380
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,700
- His name is Hoshino, Captain.

381
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,100
- I know what his name is.

382
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,767
Back in Japan they
call him Akita.

383
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,200
You know what that is?

384
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,000
A Japanese dog dives
headfirst into everything,

385
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,333
never knows when to back off.

386
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:24,067
Your superiors are real
interested in hearing

387
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:25,633
your version of this story,

388
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:26,567
back in Kyoto.

389
00:29:26,567 --> 00:29:27,533
- Sir, I can't leave until I--

390
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,067
- You're out of here tonight.

391
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:29,900
End of story.

392
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,167
(light knock)

393
00:29:32,167 --> 00:29:35,500
- Captain, Decklin,
Treasury Department.

394
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,867
-  Sorry
to interrupt, sir.

395
00:29:36,867 --> 00:29:39,133
- Ah, you're not interrupting,
we're finished here.

396
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:40,633
You have a nine o'clock
reservation tonight

397
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:42,167
into Tokyo.

398
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:44,200
- That's a reservation you're
gonna have to cancel Captain.

399
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,400
- Says who?

400
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,933
- Got a letter from
your division commander,

401
00:29:46,933 --> 00:29:49,000
should explain
everything right there.

402
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
And I cleared this
with your department.

403
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,967
We want Yamata.

404
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:55,467
- What for?

405
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:57,767
- That's classified,
but you are the only one

406
00:29:57,767 --> 00:30:01,567
who's seen his enforcer
up close, Jaho.

407
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:03,133
- Excuse me, but
Jaho is not a name,

408
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:05,400
it's a kind of
ninja black magic.

409
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,100
- (light scoff) Ninja?

410
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,900
You don't mind if we stick
to the 20th century, do you?

411
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,500
I had Interpol send
over their photo books,

412
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,067
I want you to look
at the mugshots,

413
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:13,367
every single one of 'em.

414
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:16,233
And, uh, you mind if I
take a minute outside?

415
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:17,467
- Be my guest.

416
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:19,700
- We'll coordinate on this.

417
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:26,167
- Decklin's the fed that
wanted to see Yamata yesterday.

418
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:28,133
- Yes, I know.

419
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:30,700
- Look, what happened last
night was gang related, Captain.

420
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,867
- No doubt, they stole
the priest's body.

421
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:33,967
- Father Munoz?

422
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:35,300
-  Yeah.

423
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,833
- But why?

424
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,367
- All I know, is that they
scrambled up the morgue

425
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:42,500
so that we couldn't tell
which bodies were missing.

426
00:30:48,133 --> 00:30:52,600
I've gotta know what the
feds are up to with Yamata.

427
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,167
So, he's your baby.

428
00:30:56,033 --> 00:30:57,133
- Who?

429
00:30:57,133 --> 00:30:58,233
- The Akita.

430
00:30:58,233 --> 00:30:59,000
-  Again?

431
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,433
- Stay on him.

432
00:31:00,433 --> 00:31:01,533
- Oh Captain, you're
gonna have to get somebody

433
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:03,667
who gets along with Japs.

434
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:04,600
Japanese.

435
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,800
- Do I have crap in my ears,

436
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,967
or did I just hear
racial bigotry

437
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:09,233
coming from a detective
in my department.

438
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:12,700
- Captain we have two
gangs ready to go to war.

439
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,033
- Your gang activities
are on hold.

440
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:15,867
- But why?

441
00:31:15,867 --> 00:31:17,133
- Look,

442
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:18,233
just give him the tour,
show him some mug books,

443
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:19,633
take him down to the range,

444
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:20,833
take him down to the goddamned
movies, I don't care.

445
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:23,233
Just keep him off the street.

446
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:25,567
And Ryder,

447
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:29,533
the Kyoto police seem to
think that he might have been

448
00:31:29,533 --> 00:31:31,800
responsible for his
last partner's death.

449
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,633
- Thanks.

450
00:31:33,533 --> 00:31:35,333
(quick rapping knock)

451
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:36,467
-  Councilman Royce.

452
00:31:36,467 --> 00:31:38,600
- Harry, good to see you.

453
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,433
-  Councilman.

454
00:31:39,433 --> 00:31:40,700
- Detective Ryder is it?

455
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,533
- Mm-Hm.

456
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:42,500
- Have a seat please.

457
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,233
- Thank you sir.

458
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:45,867
-  How can I help you?

459
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:47,100
- Well, Harry, I've
got a situation

460
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,767
I'm gonna really
need your help with.

461
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:50,133
My people finally
set up a meeting

462
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:52,033
between the Malitos
and the Icemen,

463
00:31:52,033 --> 00:31:54,233
and it's for the
22nd of this month.

464
00:31:54,233 --> 00:31:55,800
- Excuse us please.

465
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:58,800
- Excuse me.

466
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:03,333
- I think I can help you.

467
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:06,167
- You can reach
me at this number.

468
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,867
- Thank you Hoshino.

469
00:32:10,867 --> 00:32:13,933
Our government
appreciates your help.

470
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,667
Talk to me and nobody else,

471
00:32:20,667 --> 00:32:24,533
we think Yamata's bought
a cop in this division.

472
00:32:28,933 --> 00:32:32,467
- Look, I have orders to
give you the grand tour.

473
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:33,533
Let's hit it.

474
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,267
(clears throat)

475
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:44,833
On your right is
an office, off-ice.

476
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:49,633
- And on my left, a
sleeping policemen, on duty.

477
00:32:49,633 --> 00:32:52,833
- You want perfection,
get a robot.

478
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,233
- It's obvious you
don't like my country

479
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:55,900
and I don't like yours.

480
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,167
- Yeah, well I have my reasons.

481
00:32:58,167 --> 00:32:58,967
- So do I.

482
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:07,267
- And just where the hell
do you think you're going?

483
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:09,767
- Little Tokyo, I'm
gonna find Jaho.

484
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:11,900
- The hell you are.

485
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,267
- Am I your prisoner?

486
00:33:14,267 --> 00:33:15,100
- Not yet.

487
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,533
Look, we both have our orders.

488
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:23,233
It happens to be my job to
keep you out of circulation.

489
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:24,833
You get in between
me and my job,

490
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:28,800
and I will find 50
reasons to lock you up.

491
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,400
- Don't worry, I'm not
gonna give you the slip.

492
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,167
Might ruin your reputation.

493
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:36,000
- Hey, anyway you
want it Hoshino.

494
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,033
You don't have to
play nice with me

495
00:33:40,033 --> 00:33:42,567
just because I'm
a woman, Hoshino.

496
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:44,033
As it happens, I had
to be twice as good

497
00:33:44,033 --> 00:33:46,933
as a man to make detective.

498
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:51,000
And how did you earn
your sterling reputation?

499
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
- The Akita?

500
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,900
I was 12 years old
when I moved to Japan.

501
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:01,333
The only half-white
kid at my school.

502
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:05,367
To survive, I had to become
more Japanese than the Japanese.

503
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:06,933
A good old-fashioned
banzai charge

504
00:34:06,933 --> 00:34:09,367
saved my tail more than once.

505
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:14,200
Does it frighten you?

506
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,467
- What?

507
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:18,633
- Being alone in the
dark with a mad dog?

508
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:21,167
- I haven't been afraid
of anything in pants

509
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:23,333
since, I don't know, I was

510
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,633
six years old.

511
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:28,467
Excuse me.

512
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,667
- Mugs looks, never seen
this many mug shots.

513
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:41,067
S'pose we actually have
to do this right now?

514
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,833
- This?

515
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,533
This is the cause of half
the problems in the world.

516
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:50,700
- The watch?

517
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,200
- Time, time changes
all the rules.

518
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,800
My dad carried this watch
to work every morning

519
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,900
for 29 years.

520
00:34:59,033 --> 00:35:00,833
He was a foreman
in Flint, Michigan.

521
00:35:00,833 --> 00:35:01,667
GM.

522
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:02,867
- Where they make cars?

523
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:06,200
- Where they used to
make cars, Mr. Hoshino.

524
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,133
One year before his retirement,
the plant closed down.

525
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:12,233
Japanese imports.

526
00:35:12,233 --> 00:35:14,800
Other auto plants
weren't hiring, so,

527
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,167
he got a job running
a liquor store.

528
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:21,233
And one night a kid came in,

529
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:23,900
shot him in the heart with a 22.

530
00:35:25,367 --> 00:35:27,867
- That's why you became a cop.

531
00:35:29,167 --> 00:35:33,567
- And came out here, I
couldn't stay in Flint anymore.

532
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:36,200
Look, it's almost four.

533
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,567
Just between you
and me, alright?

534
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:41,067
I called one of my snitches,

535
00:35:41,067 --> 00:35:43,167
he's an ex-gang member.

536
00:35:43,167 --> 00:35:45,533
He said that the Icemen

537
00:35:45,533 --> 00:35:48,800
meet with some people
from out of town.

538
00:35:49,933 --> 00:35:52,833
You're strictly
along for the ride.

539
00:35:52,833 --> 00:35:54,333
I mean it Hoshino.

540
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:01,633
Sure you don't want some fries?

541
00:36:01,633 --> 00:36:03,200
- No thanks.

542
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,667
How can you eat that mess?

543
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:06,900
- Hey, I don't
need dietary advice

544
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,767
from a guy who probably eats

545
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:11,967
raw octopus tentacles
for breakfast.

546
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:13,800
(radio chatter)

547
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,633
Leave the radio alone.

548
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,733
- It was modern.

549
00:36:18,733 --> 00:36:20,667
- Yeah, before it was
so goddamn modern,

550
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:22,133
they used to make
them in this country

551
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:25,067
and they worked just fine.

552
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:27,733
- You Americans are very touchy.

553
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,567
- It's probably nothing.

554
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:44,400
- Right.

555
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:53,867
Is that it?

556
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:54,700
- Yeah.

557
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:58,300
- Then what are we doing
parking way over here?

558
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,500
- Because they know my car.

559
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,300
- You've been in there?

560
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,733
- The Diamond? Sure,
lot's of times.

561
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:07,333
It's an Iceman hangout.

562
00:37:07,333 --> 00:37:08,167
- Is it dark?

563
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:09,167
- Very.

564
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:10,000
Why?

565
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:13,767
- Maybe one of us ought to
slip inside and take a look.

566
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:14,600
- No.

567
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:18,000
- Yamata's car.

568
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,633
- Yes.

569
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:25,000
But this time let's do it right.

570
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,833
We'll stay with the car,
we'll call for backup.

571
00:37:27,833 --> 00:37:29,500
- You're right, someone
should stay out here

572
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,033
in case they come out.

573
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:32,867
- Hoshino!

574
00:37:34,067 --> 00:37:35,667
- I'll just blend
in with the crowd.

575
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,700
- It won't work.

576
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,767
(heavy gangster rap)

577
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:56,533
- I want associate
guarantees the authorities

578
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:58,100
won't interrupt us.

579
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:02,067
And we guarantee
the merchandise.

580
00:38:02,067 --> 00:38:03,667
So all you have to do

581
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:06,367
is show up with the money.

582
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,133
- Ah, shit, that ain't
gonna be no problem.

583
00:38:08,133 --> 00:38:08,967
- Good.

584
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:14,433
- I'll have a beer.

585
00:38:14,433 --> 00:38:15,267
- Thanks.

586
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,833
(combative hits)

587
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:34,500
-  C'mon man.

588
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,900
C'mon, get him down.

589
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,667
Son of gun is quick.

590
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:47,333
(pained grunts)

591
00:38:49,467 --> 00:38:51,967
Hit him, hit him, get him man.

592
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,100
Oh man, c'mon homey.

593
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:03,400
Knock him down.

594
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:09,333
Ah, here's my man.

595
00:39:11,867 --> 00:39:14,467
(hooting cheers)

596
00:39:14,467 --> 00:39:16,633
Yeah, do it again.

597
00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:18,733
Do it again my brother.

598
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:21,233
That's right, you got it goin'.

599
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,967
(forceful grunt)

600
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:34,000
Here's my man, here's my man.

601
00:39:39,533 --> 00:39:42,400
-  That's right.

602
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,400
(suspenseful music)

603
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,733
(pained moans)

604
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:04,267
Game over, game over.

605
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:05,833
(two gunshots)

606
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:07,000
- Police.

607
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,533
These men are wanted

608
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:10,100
for conspiracy
charges in connection

609
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,000
with the Ku Klux Klan.

610
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
- I knew your ass was
too weird to be straight.

611
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,267
You and your pasty-ass
peckerwood friend.

612
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:19,500
- What?

613
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,033
- Shut the fuck up
you blue-eyed bitch.

614
00:40:21,033 --> 00:40:22,900
-  KKK is
tryin' to set up the Icemen.

615
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,933
- These men are in my custody.

616
00:40:25,933 --> 00:40:27,500
- Hell yeah, we gonna
take care of these two

617
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,633
the old-fashioned way.

618
00:40:28,633 --> 00:40:31,467
(concussive boom)

619
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,300
- Let's go!

620
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,900
(screeching tires)

621
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,733
- Shit.

622
00:40:39,733 --> 00:40:40,700
Get in, let's go.

623
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:44,867
(intense orchestral music)

624
00:40:44,867 --> 00:40:47,933
(squealing tires)

625
00:40:47,933 --> 00:40:50,567
(anguished groans)

626
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:52,167
(stressed coughs)

627
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:53,000
- Hoshino.

628
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,433
God, I can't take you anywhere.

629
00:40:57,433 --> 00:41:00,200
(squalling tires)

630
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,900
- C'mon, let's go.

631
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:32,400
- That policeman has
caused us enough trouble.

632
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,267
He's finished.

633
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:36,033
- I'll take care of the woman.

634
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:38,400
- First things first,

635
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,733
I don't think our black
friends will do business

636
00:41:40,733 --> 00:41:43,133
with us any longer.

637
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:43,967
So,

638
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:47,400
our partner will make a deal

639
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,833
let's remind them how much
they need our merchandise.

640
00:41:55,367 --> 00:41:58,567
(heavy knocking)

641
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:01,000
- Oh, let's get him in there.

642
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:04,067
Has he met the assassin again?

643
00:42:04,067 --> 00:42:05,100
- Yes.

644
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,500
Is he gonna be okay?

645
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,933
- Marico! Brandy!

646
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:10,567
Let's get him down here.

647
00:42:10,567 --> 00:42:11,900
- It's his back.

648
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:20,800
- Oh, there may
be serious damage.

649
00:42:21,967 --> 00:42:23,733
My acupuncture needles

650
00:42:23,733 --> 00:42:27,300
and incense from
the drawer, quickly.

651
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,400
I hope it's not too
late to save him.

652
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:38,367
(bass laden doo-wop)

653
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:40,400
- Feelin' better?

654
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,533
Don't mind me Hoshino, I
grew up with three brothers.

655
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:46,667
Besides, I thought men and
women took baths together

656
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:48,467
all the time in your country.

657
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:49,533
- That's different.

658
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:50,933
- Really?

659
00:42:50,933 --> 00:42:54,100
Oh, you mean because
of the ice water.

660
00:42:55,067 --> 00:42:56,767
Poor Thomas.

661
00:42:56,767 --> 00:43:00,600
I suppose it is a
belittling experience.

662
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,233
Remember when I asked
you why Yamata was here,

663
00:43:03,233 --> 00:43:05,233
what you said?

664
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:06,300
- Hiding out?

665
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,700
- No, no, no.

666
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,167
About financing his
takeover in Japan.

667
00:43:10,167 --> 00:43:12,000
He's here to make money.

668
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,467
I also found out
our friend Decklin

669
00:43:13,467 --> 00:43:15,267
is with the Treasury Department,

670
00:43:15,267 --> 00:43:17,833
Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

671
00:43:17,833 --> 00:43:20,800
So why do you suppose
they want Yamata?

672
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,300
- He's selling alcohol
and tobacco to the gangs.

673
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,567
- Exactly.

674
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:25,967
Guns and weapons.

675
00:43:27,267 --> 00:43:29,800
- American gangs
already have weapons.

676
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,633
- Maybe these are
special weapons.

677
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,133
- I'm freezing!

678
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:40,700
- You're a samurai.

679
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:51,733
- Ah,

680
00:43:51,733 --> 00:43:53,067
Now I'm scalded.

681
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:56,633
I'm a frozen, scalded samurai.

682
00:43:57,633 --> 00:43:59,633
- Any permanent damage?

683
00:43:59,633 --> 00:44:01,133
- The wells are deep.

684
00:44:01,133 --> 00:44:03,433
I had to use all
the katsu I know,

685
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:06,133
energy restoration techniques.

686
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:08,200
I think he'll be alright.

687
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:10,833
- But?

688
00:44:10,833 --> 00:44:14,233
- Fate has pitted Thomas
against this assassin.

689
00:44:14,233 --> 00:44:17,800
When day meets night,
only one can survive.

690
00:44:20,733 --> 00:44:24,567
We must complete the training
you began as a child.

691
00:44:24,567 --> 00:44:26,767
We must start it, immediately.

692
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:28,300
- Thanks anyway,

693
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,767
but I remember those torture
sessions you call training.

694
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:32,600
- Train or die, drink.

695
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,533
- Oh, gah, what is this stuff.

696
00:44:42,533 --> 00:44:44,633
- Herb tea with vitamins.

697
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:46,233
Drink up.

698
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:48,233
(light belch)

699
00:44:48,233 --> 00:44:51,000
(ethereal music)

700
00:45:11,167 --> 00:45:14,667
(suspenseful electronica)

701
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:41,100
(quickening syncopation)

702
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,733
(squealing tires)

703
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:01,800
(quickened gunshot)

704
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,733
- Iceman.

705
00:46:02,733 --> 00:46:05,400
(roaring blast)

706
00:46:11,033 --> 00:46:13,967
So much for sales resistance.

707
00:46:13,967 --> 00:46:17,033
Now we are going to leave
a message for the Malitos,

708
00:46:17,033 --> 00:46:19,567
and I need your help.

709
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:21,700
You don't mind, do you?

710
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,000
No, of course not.

711
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,433
That's what I like about you,

712
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:31,500
you keep your mouth shut.

713
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,700
(distant sirens)

714
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:37,133
(malicious chuckle)

715
00:46:37,133 --> 00:46:40,033
(turbulent flames)

716
00:46:47,067 --> 00:46:48,633
- Precision Thomas.

717
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:53,067
Each pressure point is
smaller than a fingertip.

718
00:46:53,067 --> 00:46:56,333
(forceful grunts)

719
00:46:56,333 --> 00:47:00,433
Muscle power, where is your
focus, where is your chi?

720
00:47:03,267 --> 00:47:04,700
Imagine your arm is a--

721
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:08,900
- Is a high-pressured
hose, I remember Igasan.

722
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,267
But I haven't slept
much the past few days,

723
00:47:11,267 --> 00:47:12,100
so if you don't mind--

724
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,533
- I do mind.

725
00:47:13,533 --> 00:47:16,533
(chirping crickets)

726
00:47:22,233 --> 00:47:23,067
Good.

727
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:25,267
Now,

728
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,367
gather the force of
the waters in your palm

729
00:47:30,367 --> 00:47:33,333
and project it
through your fingers

730
00:47:33,333 --> 00:47:35,400
and try to throw me back.

731
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Rasputin can pee
stronger than that.

732
00:47:48,433 --> 00:47:51,133
- How am I supposed to push
you if I can't touch you?

733
00:47:51,133 --> 00:47:52,467
It's impossible.

734
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,900
(haunting flute)

735
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,133
- Hit me.

736
00:48:09,267 --> 00:48:10,400
- Igasan.

737
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:11,467
- Hit me now.

738
00:48:17,667 --> 00:48:20,267
(pained grunt)

739
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,567
True master can repel or
draw a man 15 feet away.

740
00:48:29,767 --> 00:48:33,700
Teacher is the needle,
the disciple the thread.

741
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,867
Come, come on.

742
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,833
You have a gift, Thomas.

743
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:41,500
I sensed it when you were a boy.

744
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,400
Unlike your enemy, you
can heal with these hands

745
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,967
as well as destroy.

746
00:48:48,367 --> 00:48:51,767
But first you must tame the
anger that lives in your belly.

747
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:52,600
- Anger? I--

748
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,433
- Shh,

749
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,533
meditate.

750
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:01,967
You have to name the anger
before you can tame it.

751
00:49:05,433 --> 00:49:06,700
Open your mind.

752
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:13,467
(speaking in foreign language)

753
00:49:13,467 --> 00:49:15,567
No design, no conception.

754
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:20,367
(mournful chatter)

755
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,233
- Get all our homeboys together.

756
00:49:32,233 --> 00:49:33,933
I want every gangster
we got to be in front

757
00:49:33,933 --> 00:49:35,433
of my pad by 10 o'clock.

758
00:49:35,433 --> 00:49:37,000
These putos wanna get crazy,

759
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,033
then we go to war.

760
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:42,100
If you ain't got a car to get
to my pad, then steal one.

761
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,567
Icemen are gonna pay for this.

762
00:49:44,567 --> 00:49:46,067
-  And she didn't
tell you what was going on?

763
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:46,900
- No.

764
00:49:56,767 --> 00:49:58,567
I think I should
go in by myself.

765
00:49:58,567 --> 00:50:00,400
They'll feel less
threatened by a woman.

766
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,767
- Are you sure you don't
want them to feel threatened?

767
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:06,333
- I've done a lot of
favors for these people.

768
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:07,500
It'll be okay.

769
00:50:14,167 --> 00:50:15,600
Not Father Munoz.

770
00:50:16,733 --> 00:50:18,233
Oh God, thank you.

771
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,933
- I want everybody strapped,

772
00:50:21,933 --> 00:50:24,367
I want every piece we've
got on the streets.

773
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:26,733
Hordito, get me empty
bottles, lots of them,

774
00:50:26,733 --> 00:50:29,400
and ten gallons of gasolina.

775
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,600
Hey, we don't need you here.

776
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,533
- Don't do this Hector.

777
00:50:31,533 --> 00:50:32,733
- Don't do what?

778
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:34,700
- Father Munoz would
be the first to say it,

779
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,400
let the police handle this.

780
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,700
- Well maybe you
haven't noticed,

781
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,367
but his way hasn't worked.

782
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:42,267
- You start a war and nobody's
gonna be safe on the street.

783
00:50:42,267 --> 00:50:44,767
Not kids, old people, no one.

784
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:46,333
- We didn't start nothin' lady.

785
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:48,433
- What do you call blowing
up a car on Icemen's turf?

786
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:49,900
- We didn't have
anything to do with that.

787
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,700
They were building a
bomb to blow us up with.

788
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,867
We had enough.

789
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,067
(speaking in foreign language)

790
00:51:01,067 --> 00:51:03,233
Can't down us all homeboy.

791
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:12,000
- I believe the lady was
tryin' to tell you somethin'.

792
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,900
(speaking in foreign language)

793
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,067
- All I'm saying is wait,

794
00:51:20,067 --> 00:51:21,733
wait and think.

795
00:51:21,733 --> 00:51:23,567
Councilman Royce said
he set up a meeting

796
00:51:23,567 --> 00:51:25,833
between you and the
Icemen on the 22nd,

797
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,467
that's eight days.

798
00:51:27,467 --> 00:51:29,367
- Yeah, we'll wait,

799
00:51:29,367 --> 00:51:30,433
if they wait.

800
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,500
- So, have you
started your training?

801
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,500
- Don't ask.

802
00:51:53,767 --> 00:51:54,833
- Thanks for your call Rita.

803
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:56,367
- I'm not doing this for you.

804
00:51:56,367 --> 00:51:57,567
- I know, thanks anyway.

805
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,567
- Whatever you're going
to do, you better do

806
00:51:58,567 --> 00:52:00,467
before the 18th of the month.

807
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:02,600
- That's four days.

808
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,700
- Hector says we
got some help now,

809
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,367
some people from out of town.

810
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:08,467
On the 18th he says
the Mal and the Icemen

811
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:11,300
are gonna find out what
real war is all about.

812
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,233
I gotta go.

813
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,933
(rumbling engine)

814
00:52:23,667 --> 00:52:25,633
- You know what I'm thinking?

815
00:52:25,633 --> 00:52:27,367
- If Yamata wanted to
sell a lot of weapons--

816
00:52:27,367 --> 00:52:29,767
- Heavy weapons, machine
guns, explosives.

817
00:52:29,767 --> 00:52:31,200
- If he needed cash fast,

818
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,033
what better way then
to start a gang war.

819
00:52:33,033 --> 00:52:36,500
- And sell weapons
to both sides.

820
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,533
- It's an ugly thought.

821
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:38,533
- It's ugly.

822
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,700
- And the grisly decapitation
murder of Desiree Hobbs

823
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,300
at the graveside of
her brother James,

824
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,900
also a victim of the gang feud.

825
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:53,333
- Looks like one of
your little gangbangers

826
00:52:53,333 --> 00:52:56,467
got all excited and
lost their head.

827
00:52:56,467 --> 00:52:58,467
Welfare check was probably late.

828
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:00,200
(venomous laugh)

829
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,367
- God Ray, did your mother
have any children that lived?

830
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,267
You seen Captain Meisler?

831
00:53:08,267 --> 00:53:11,267
- Another lunch
downtown with brass.

832
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,267
- I need some help finding
Hoshino's fugitive.

833
00:53:15,267 --> 00:53:17,167
You remember the guy Yamata?

834
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:18,833
- Yeah.

835
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:21,700
- Why the hell can't
Hoe-Shine-Oh find
his own fugitive?

836
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:26,033
- We think Yamata is arming the
gangs with military weapons.

837
00:53:26,033 --> 00:53:28,667
In four days all hell
is gonna break loose.

838
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:29,567
- Oh Jesus.

839
00:53:30,733 --> 00:53:32,200
- Councilman Royce
set up a meeting

840
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,033
with the two gang leaders,
but by then it'll be too late.

841
00:53:36,033 --> 00:53:39,400
When he comes back from
Washington Monday morning,

842
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,567
see if he can make
it before the 18th.

843
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,800
If we can convince

844
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:49,300
Hector and Gamal
they're being used,

845
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,967
they'll help us find Yamata.

846
00:53:50,967 --> 00:53:53,967
(wet hacking cough)

847
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:57,633
- Personally, I think we
oughta let the savages

848
00:53:57,633 --> 00:53:59,300
kill each other off.

849
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:03,633
(snarky giggle)

850
00:54:03,633 --> 00:54:06,567
- Ah Karen, we'll
get the word out.

851
00:54:07,433 --> 00:54:08,433
- Thank you.

852
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,467
(intense electronic music)

853
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,133
(clacking wood)

854
00:54:47,133 --> 00:54:49,800
(pained grunts)

855
00:54:56,167 --> 00:55:00,033
(speaking in foreign language)

856
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,900
(whistling swipes)

857
00:55:47,767 --> 00:55:49,833
- Feel the energy around you.

858
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:53,333
Receive those things
which cannot be seen.

859
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,033
Slowly Thomas, slowly.

860
00:56:29,133 --> 00:56:31,133
Kata, moving meditation.

861
00:56:33,433 --> 00:56:35,433
Visualize your opponent.

862
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,367
Feel each strike, better.

863
00:56:42,033 --> 00:56:44,233
See your opponent's move

864
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:45,900
then float with him.

865
00:56:47,033 --> 00:56:49,733
When he thinks
like the mountains

866
00:56:49,733 --> 00:56:51,467
attack like the seas.

867
00:56:55,867 --> 00:56:57,267
Oh, you mustn't go yet.

868
00:56:57,267 --> 00:57:00,467
Have a drink, a
bath, a massage, huh?

869
00:57:00,467 --> 00:57:02,167
- Thanks anyway Boonie,

870
00:57:02,167 --> 00:57:05,067
I just came to see if
you finished him off yet.

871
00:57:05,067 --> 00:57:06,867
Does a killer fight like that?

872
00:57:06,867 --> 00:57:10,033
- The Death Touch can
be used with any style.

873
00:57:10,033 --> 00:57:11,600
This is Shorin Ryu.

874
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:16,033
Don't tell Thomas, but
he was my best student.

875
00:57:16,033 --> 00:57:17,533
- It's our secret.

876
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:21,833
Hey, I gotta meeting
with Councilman Royce,

877
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:23,333
I'll talk to you later?

878
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:24,967
- Guess you forgot,

879
00:57:24,967 --> 00:57:26,800
Councilman wants to see me too.

880
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,667
Just give me a minute to change.

881
00:57:28,667 --> 00:57:30,000
- Into a what?

882
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,733
- We have work to do.

883
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,367
- Charles Decklin please.

884
00:57:49,733 --> 00:57:52,267
Thanks, I really had
to get out of there.

885
00:57:52,267 --> 00:57:53,833
- Good.

886
00:57:53,833 --> 00:57:56,133
Maybe after I talk
to the councilman,

887
00:57:56,133 --> 00:57:57,833
we can look at those mugshots.

888
00:57:57,833 --> 00:57:59,667
- We covered all of that
in the last meeting.

889
00:57:59,667 --> 00:58:01,333
I know, I will handle it.

890
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:02,167
Yes, yes.

891
00:58:05,233 --> 00:58:06,433
(ringing beep)

892
00:58:06,433 --> 00:58:09,733
Dolores, get me some
donuts, coffee, plasma.

893
00:58:17,433 --> 00:58:18,867
- Can I help you?

894
00:58:35,067 --> 00:58:37,700
- I feel like a tourist.

895
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,267
- You don't look like a tourist.

896
00:58:39,267 --> 00:58:40,767
Japanese tourists
wear dark suits,

897
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:44,800
they walk around in groups,
and they carry little cameras.

898
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:47,000
- Your humor sucks.

899
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,533
- Sucks?

900
00:58:48,533 --> 00:58:51,933
- That is the right
word, isn't it?

901
00:58:51,933 --> 00:58:54,200
- Yes, it's the right word.

902
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:56,967
Hey, make him?

903
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:01,133
- The morgue.

904
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,033
- Thomas!

905
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,933
(startling music)

906
00:59:11,233 --> 00:59:14,000
(whistling hits)

907
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,733
(combustive blows)

908
01:00:20,433 --> 01:00:23,267
(stifling gurgle)

909
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,967
(crushing snap)

910
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,267
(warbling hits)

911
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:25,033
(crashing blast)

912
01:01:33,233 --> 01:01:34,167
- You okay?

913
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:39,433
(slow grunting)

914
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:41,400
- C'mon.

915
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,267
- No!

916
01:01:42,267 --> 01:01:44,267
-  Trust me.

917
01:01:44,267 --> 01:01:45,767
-  Hoshino!

918
01:01:50,767 --> 01:01:51,600
- You okay?

919
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,767
C'mon.
- Yeah.

920
01:01:57,367 --> 01:01:58,367
(screeching tires)

921
01:01:58,367 --> 01:01:59,200
Thanks.

922
01:02:03,533 --> 01:02:05,133
He's dead, isn't he?

923
01:02:05,133 --> 01:02:07,000
- You oughta know.

924
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,100
- Wait a minute, you
don't think that we?

925
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,700
They were pros,

926
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,600
we got here after.

927
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,967
C'mon, Gamal, you know me.

928
01:02:14,967 --> 01:02:17,100
- Oh yeah, I know you.

929
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:19,067
Lyin' white bitch cop.

930
01:02:19,067 --> 01:02:21,133
Ku Klux Klan my ass.

931
01:02:21,133 --> 01:02:22,833
It's you and Kung Fu over here.

932
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:25,300
The man's neck is broke.

933
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:27,933
And we got a call about some
trouble, I think we found it.

934
01:02:27,933 --> 01:02:29,067
- They're getting away.

935
01:02:29,067 --> 01:02:30,967
- Freeze mother fucker.

936
01:02:30,967 --> 01:02:32,600
At first the Malitos
blow our people up.

937
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,067
- It wasn't the Malitos.

938
01:02:34,067 --> 01:02:35,800
- Oh, that's what you say,

939
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:36,800
and now you tryin'
to tell somethin'

940
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,367
about some dudes
that ain't here?

941
01:02:38,367 --> 01:02:40,500
- C'mon Gamal, don't
go cement-head on me.

942
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,400
Somebody is tryin'
to start a war here.

943
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,000
- Yeah, there's gonna
be a war alright.

944
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:45,833
- Drop it!

945
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:49,100
Get out of here, hit the road.

946
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,000
We're gonna stay here
and chat a little bit.

947
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,233
-  Thanks.

948
01:02:52,233 --> 01:02:53,833
- Sorry I was late, you
stay in touch, 'kay?

949
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:55,833
- Yeah, enjoy the sunshine.

950
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:57,700
New Ice Age be comin' soon.

951
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:00,267
- You tell anybody else
we were gonna be here?

952
01:03:00,267 --> 01:03:01,633
-  Did you?

953
01:03:01,633 --> 01:03:03,300
- What's that supposed to mean?

954
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,367
- Just what I said.

955
01:03:05,367 --> 01:03:07,233
- Goddamned Beirut down there.

956
01:03:07,233 --> 01:03:08,900
- I was doing my job.

957
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,933
- Wrong Detective,
your job is Hoshino.

958
01:03:11,933 --> 01:03:14,233
Hoshino and the feds.

959
01:03:14,233 --> 01:03:16,667
- There's only one job
in this city right now.

960
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:19,367
If you'd skip a couple lunches
with the Old Boy Network

961
01:03:19,367 --> 01:03:22,100
downtown, maybe you'd
know what's going on.

962
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:23,667
- You're suspended, 10 days.

963
01:03:23,667 --> 01:03:26,833
- Damnit Captain, we
think Yamata is trying

964
01:03:26,833 --> 01:03:30,633
to start a gang war and sell
military weapons to both sides.

965
01:03:30,633 --> 01:03:32,600
- A whole squad of
experienced detectives

966
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:34,400
and you're the only one
that knows about this

967
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,600
grand conspiracy, right?

968
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,400
- These people are
not street gangsters,

969
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:42,367
they're pros, you can't
possibly be that dumb.

970
01:03:42,367 --> 01:03:44,000
- 20 days.

971
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,667
And I even suspect you
and your Japanese friend

972
01:03:45,667 --> 01:03:48,767
are on the street, I'll
put you in leg irons Ryder.

973
01:03:48,767 --> 01:03:51,600
Now get the hell
out of my office.

974
01:03:55,567 --> 01:03:56,667
- Idiot.

975
01:03:56,667 --> 01:03:57,467
- 30 days.

976
01:04:03,833 --> 01:04:05,333
- Trouble?

977
01:04:05,333 --> 01:04:09,367
- Yes, certain people don't
want to let me do my job.

978
01:04:12,233 --> 01:04:13,067
Pig.

979
01:04:14,233 --> 01:04:15,800
- Good.

980
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,700
Concentrate on what is.

981
01:04:18,933 --> 01:04:21,667
Ignore that which
does not exist.

982
01:04:22,833 --> 01:04:25,933
That is the secret
of defeating ninjas.

983
01:04:29,933 --> 01:04:32,700
- Sure I can't get
you something Igasan.

984
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,667
You simply have
to learn to relax.

985
01:04:34,667 --> 01:04:37,000
- Just because fate
has put us here

986
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,467
doesn't mean I have
to be uncomfortable.

987
01:04:39,467 --> 01:04:41,967
(light laugh)

988
01:04:47,433 --> 01:04:49,867
I was beginning to think
even with my superior

989
01:04:49,867 --> 01:04:52,867
teaching skills
would not be enough.

990
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:56,133
You've done well Thomas.

991
01:04:56,133 --> 01:04:59,867
But remember, your
enemy can start fires,

992
01:04:59,867 --> 01:05:02,633
he can crack boulders
with his chi.

993
01:05:02,633 --> 01:05:05,700
I talked with your
father many times.

994
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:09,667
I know two nations
are at war inside you.

995
01:05:09,667 --> 01:05:13,833
Two halves, to achieve the
power you need to survive,

996
01:05:15,633 --> 01:05:18,967
you will have to make
peace with yourself.

997
01:05:18,967 --> 01:05:20,867
Become whole.

998
01:05:20,867 --> 01:05:22,867
That I cannot teach you.

999
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:27,667
- I'm working on it Igasan.

1000
01:05:27,667 --> 01:05:31,167
I promised to meet
Karen, Detective Ryder.

1001
01:05:39,933 --> 01:05:41,833
- Police believe that the
death of Councilman Royce

1002
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:43,133
was gang related.

1003
01:05:43,133 --> 01:05:45,467
The councilman had just
returned from Washington

1004
01:05:45,467 --> 01:05:48,500
where he was working
to secure federal loans

1005
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,367
for black-owned businesses.

1006
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:52,567
Police are looking
for Hector Flores,

1007
01:05:52,567 --> 01:05:55,033
a member of the
Malitos street gang,

1008
01:05:55,033 --> 01:05:57,700
In connection with the murder.

1009
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,033
- Hi.

1010
01:05:59,033 --> 01:05:59,867
- Hi.

1011
01:06:01,533 --> 01:06:03,200
- Is anything wrong?

1012
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,467
- Me, no, I'm on vacation.

1013
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,700
Alright, I shot my mouth off,

1014
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:22,533
I got suspended for 30
days, I'm off the case.

1015
01:06:23,733 --> 01:06:27,033
You hear anything from Decklin?

1016
01:06:27,033 --> 01:06:30,700
- He said gang activities
are outside his jurisdiction.

1017
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,533
- Gang activities?

1018
01:06:32,533 --> 01:06:34,167
Those guys were SWAT trained,

1019
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:36,133
they were professional
terrorists.

1020
01:06:36,133 --> 01:06:37,567
- I told him.

1021
01:06:37,567 --> 01:06:42,000
He said terrorists are outside
of his jurisdiction too.

1022
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,167
- I've had it.

1023
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:46,967
-  How bout you?

1024
01:06:46,967 --> 01:06:49,733
- So what are you gonna do now?

1025
01:06:49,733 --> 01:06:52,067
- I was hopin' to get
back to those mugshots.

1026
01:06:52,067 --> 01:06:53,133
- Sweetcakes.

1027
01:06:54,433 --> 01:06:57,133
- Perfect end to a perfect day.

1028
01:06:57,133 --> 01:06:59,567
- Hey, 30 days babe, too bad.

1029
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,800
I warned you about that mouth.

1030
01:07:06,233 --> 01:07:08,533
So what you say Tojo?

1031
01:07:08,533 --> 01:07:12,900
How you rike it here in
the land of the big PX.

1032
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:15,400
- I laugh nearly all the time.

1033
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:21,200
- I can think of something I
can do to lift your spirits.

1034
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:22,433
- What, evolve?

1035
01:07:24,933 --> 01:07:27,400
- Can't make every
case, sweetcakes.

1036
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,500
Sometimes you can't
make any of them.

1037
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:32,267
C'mon, throw some darts with me.

1038
01:07:32,267 --> 01:07:34,033
All work and no play.

1039
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:39,333
- I could show him
how to do that,

1040
01:07:39,333 --> 01:07:42,900
but I hate to take
money from amateurs.

1041
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:45,033
- Hey my man, I think
you just got called out.

1042
01:07:45,033 --> 01:07:47,300
- Well, well, Hoe-shine-oh.

1043
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:52,833
Maybe you are good at darts,

1044
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:55,300
police work don't seem
to be your strong suit.

1045
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,600
(forced chuckles)

1046
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:02,767
- I can throw 10 darts, dead
center, bullseye, blindfolded.

1047
01:08:05,633 --> 01:08:06,467
- Yee-Haw.

1048
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:13,000
- $20 says Hoshino can do it.

1049
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,700
It's a Zen thing Ray,
you wouldn't understand.

1050
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:18,200
He goes like into this trance.

1051
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:28,100
- What's the big
secret, grasshopper?

1052
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,600
- Language problem,

1053
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,467
he wanted to know how to
say asshole in English.

1054
01:08:32,467 --> 01:08:34,233
- Your 2O is covered.

1055
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:42,667
- Okay, move back, your presence
interferes with the flow.

1056
01:08:46,067 --> 01:08:47,433
Farther back.

1057
01:08:47,433 --> 01:08:48,367
Keep going.

1058
01:08:49,933 --> 01:08:50,767
Farther.

1059
01:08:53,233 --> 01:08:55,733
Keep going, to the wall, okay.

1060
01:09:00,567 --> 01:09:02,067
Hokkaido, Jujitsu.

1061
01:09:12,733 --> 01:09:17,567
- Well you were right, he
couldn't do it, you won.

1062
01:09:17,567 --> 01:09:18,967
But, he also one.

1063
01:09:21,233 --> 01:09:24,100
He bet me he could make
you pee in your pants.

1064
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:27,033
(raucous laughter)

1065
01:09:28,933 --> 01:09:31,000
Andy, drinks are on Ray.

1066
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:31,833
Yes!

1067
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,900
- Let me drive.

1068
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:39,200
- Okay, nobody drives
Catherine the Cadillac but me.

1069
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,200
- C'mon, I've never
driven an American car.

1070
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,300
- Okay, I'll let you drive,

1071
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:47,500
but stay on the right
side of the road.

1072
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,933
Hey, that was such a cool
trick, how did you do it?

1073
01:09:50,933 --> 01:09:52,600
- Trick? What trick?

1074
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,000
How'd you find this place?

1075
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,267
- Someone dumped a body
here a couple years ago.

1076
01:10:11,267 --> 01:10:12,833
- Lovely.

1077
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:14,767
- Yeah, it is isn't it?

1078
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:19,567
- Well, I suppose if you're
a body and have to get dumped

1079
01:10:19,567 --> 01:10:21,333
this is a pretty
good place for it.

1080
01:10:21,333 --> 01:10:24,167
(bright giggling)

1081
01:10:25,433 --> 01:10:27,267
- It's pretty up here.

1082
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:33,933
- This suspension probably isn't

1083
01:10:33,933 --> 01:10:36,267
as serious as you think it is.

1084
01:10:36,267 --> 01:10:40,433
- I screwed up, I got
personally involved.

1085
01:10:40,433 --> 01:10:44,300
- I never met a good cop who
didn't get personally involved.

1086
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,900
That's not the problem.

1087
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:49,133
- What is that supposed to mean?

1088
01:10:49,133 --> 01:10:50,933
- Your good.

1089
01:10:50,933 --> 01:10:52,033
Tough, smart,

1090
01:10:54,367 --> 01:10:56,100
and you're beautiful.

1091
01:10:57,233 --> 01:10:59,100
You could have
whatever you want,

1092
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:01,700
but you're not happy unless
you have to fight for it,

1093
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:03,367
uphill, all the way.

1094
01:11:05,567 --> 01:11:07,800
- Okay, you have my number.

1095
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:11,567
Who are you?

1096
01:11:12,767 --> 01:11:14,933
Why did you move to Japan?

1097
01:11:17,433 --> 01:11:20,100
- My mother died, I was 12 then.

1098
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,833
Living in Cedar Rapids.

1099
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:30,600
My father took me back to
his family home in Kyoto.

1100
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,633
Because I was an (speaking
in foreign language),

1101
01:11:32,633 --> 01:11:33,800
half Japanese,

1102
01:11:34,767 --> 01:11:37,233
I had to fight almost everyday.

1103
01:11:37,233 --> 01:11:40,300
That was until I
met Buntoro Iga.

1104
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:44,967
He taught me how to fight,
taught me how not to fight.

1105
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:47,067
He taught me how to live.

1106
01:11:48,233 --> 01:11:51,367
- And you haven't
been here since then?

1107
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:57,667
- My mother's father
fought in the South Pacific

1108
01:11:57,667 --> 01:11:59,333
during World War II.

1109
01:12:01,267 --> 01:12:03,333
When my grandparents found out,

1110
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:05,233
she married a Japanese,

1111
01:12:07,433 --> 01:12:10,033
they never talked to her again.

1112
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:15,500
Not when I was born, not
even when she was dying.

1113
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,533
- God,

1114
01:12:18,533 --> 01:12:20,200
this explains a lot.

1115
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,833
Thomas you've got to
give yourself a break.

1116
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:26,700
You were born an American.

1117
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:31,067
I mean I could understand
you feeling out of place

1118
01:12:31,067 --> 01:12:34,800
in this country, but
America's a part of you.

1119
01:12:36,267 --> 01:12:39,333
- I don't feel out
of place with you.

1120
01:12:43,467 --> 01:12:46,200
(romantic flute)

1121
01:12:59,967 --> 01:13:03,900
- Remember, I'm still
a cop in the morning.

1122
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:05,467
- How can I forget?

1123
01:13:17,367 --> 01:13:18,767
This car is huge.

1124
01:13:28,133 --> 01:13:31,400
(foreboding music)

1125
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:34,233
(bright chirping)

1126
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,200
(pained moans)

1127
01:13:52,933 --> 01:13:55,600
(dark chanting)

1128
01:14:22,367 --> 01:14:24,467
- Detective Ryder? Karen?

1129
01:14:27,433 --> 01:14:29,167
- Yes Rita, I'm here.

1130
01:14:34,733 --> 01:14:35,967
I'm right here.

1131
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,600
Nothing you can do.

1132
01:14:54,767 --> 01:14:57,700
- That must've been
some dream, huh?

1133
01:14:58,867 --> 01:14:59,700
- It was.

1134
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:04,967
- Look, um, about
last night, I--

1135
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,133
- Let's take the day off.

1136
01:15:20,133 --> 01:15:22,133
- Oh, I might like that.

1137
01:15:27,033 --> 01:15:30,000
I might like that too much.

1138
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,267
- We wouldn't want that.

1139
01:15:32,267 --> 01:15:36,700
- Men think they own
women after sex, and um,

1140
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:37,967
nobody owns me.

1141
01:15:39,133 --> 01:15:40,867
- You don't know what I think.

1142
01:15:40,867 --> 01:15:42,567
- Yeah, well we'll see.

1143
01:15:42,567 --> 01:15:43,400
- We'll see?

1144
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,233
- Mm.

1145
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:49,067
- Where you going?

1146
01:15:49,067 --> 01:15:49,900
- See?

1147
01:15:52,033 --> 01:15:53,567
- So don't tell me.

1148
01:15:53,567 --> 01:15:56,167
- Okay fine, then I'll tell you.

1149
01:15:57,333 --> 01:16:00,100
I think I lost my
dad's pocket watch.

1150
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,767
I mean I had it at the
councilman's office,

1151
01:16:01,767 --> 01:16:03,700
so I'll check there.

1152
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:04,867
Maybe the bar?

1153
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:08,567
Oh, and here's Rita's number.

1154
01:16:09,967 --> 01:16:13,567
She even called, she might
have some information for us.

1155
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:14,667
- I'll take care of it.

1156
01:16:14,667 --> 01:16:16,167
- Okay, thank you.

1157
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,567
I'll call you.

1158
01:16:27,367 --> 01:16:28,200
- Igasan,

1159
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:32,300
I dreamed about him.

1160
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:34,867
- It was no dream, he was here.

1161
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:41,967
The assassin was here.

1162
01:16:41,967 --> 01:16:42,900
In my home.

1163
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,400
- The watch.

1164
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:06,600
(light suspenseful music)

1165
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:25,667
- Oh Rita, no.

1166
01:17:38,233 --> 01:17:39,400
- Put it down.

1167
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,467
- Ray!

1168
01:17:42,467 --> 01:17:44,867
- I said put it down Karen.

1169
01:17:44,867 --> 01:17:45,700
Now!

1170
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:53,900
- My watch.

1171
01:17:55,867 --> 01:17:57,433
Where did you find it?

1172
01:17:57,433 --> 01:18:00,733
- In your hand,
where you left it.

1173
01:18:00,733 --> 01:18:01,967
- You're crazy.

1174
01:18:03,133 --> 01:18:05,767
Steve, what the
hell is going on?

1175
01:18:07,867 --> 01:18:09,367
- I'm sorry Karen.

1176
01:18:10,567 --> 01:18:13,100
- We got a tip, I can't
believe you're involved

1177
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,300
with these gang assholes,

1178
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:18,300
right up to your
pretty little ears.

1179
01:18:23,167 --> 01:18:25,767
(two gunshots)

1180
01:18:26,767 --> 01:18:28,133
- Jesus Christ.

1181
01:18:28,133 --> 01:18:29,933
- It's really very simple Karen,

1182
01:18:29,933 --> 01:18:32,133
your gun killed Ray,

1183
01:18:32,133 --> 01:18:35,467
and they're gonna
find you here with it.

1184
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:41,400
Oh Ray, he talked a
great game, didn't he?

1185
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:43,533
But believe it or not

1186
01:18:43,533 --> 01:18:46,300
he was just too clean
for his own good.

1187
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:48,933
There's big money in guns Karen.

1188
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:51,200
Gangs kill each other off,

1189
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:53,033
and everybody's happy.

1190
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,467
(dark chanting)

1191
01:19:25,233 --> 01:19:28,233
(screeching brakes)

1192
01:19:40,267 --> 01:19:42,933
(sensual moans)

1193
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,367
(pained groan)

1194
01:20:06,367 --> 01:20:09,167
- Be a good boy, and
I may let her live

1195
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:10,900
a few minutes longer.

1196
01:20:13,133 --> 01:20:14,533
Pretty isn't she?

1197
01:20:15,667 --> 01:20:18,300
(pained cry)

1198
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,733
We just got acquainted.

1199
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:22,867
- Kill this psycho
son-of-a-bitch.

1200
01:20:22,867 --> 01:20:26,267
- Let her go, this is
between you and me.

1201
01:20:27,333 --> 01:20:29,767
- Oh I could've
finished you last night

1202
01:20:29,767 --> 01:20:31,933
while you were asleep.

1203
01:20:31,933 --> 01:20:35,500
But first, I want to
take something from you.

1204
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:37,100
Something you love.

1205
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:45,333
Break loose Hoshino, show
me who you really are.

1206
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:48,767
- Hurt her, and I'll
rip your heart out.

1207
01:20:48,767 --> 01:20:51,267
- There is nothing you can do.

1208
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,233
- No!

1209
01:20:54,233 --> 01:20:55,067
No.

1210
01:21:05,467 --> 01:21:06,300
Wait.

1211
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:08,067
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

1212
01:21:21,133 --> 01:21:23,233
Not the captain too.

1213
01:21:23,233 --> 01:21:24,967
God, the cops Thomas.

1214
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:29,600
Yamata has the cops
on his payroll.

1215
01:21:31,767 --> 01:21:34,933
They killed Rita,
and they killed Ray.

1216
01:21:44,367 --> 01:21:46,933
(chiming bell)

1217
01:21:55,833 --> 01:21:59,233
- Igasan, please,
she's barely breathing.

1218
01:22:01,633 --> 01:22:04,733
- I have the knowledge,
but not the gift.

1219
01:22:04,733 --> 01:22:07,733
You're the only one
who can do this.

1220
01:22:09,467 --> 01:22:11,267
- I don't know how.

1221
01:22:11,267 --> 01:22:13,267
- You have always known.

1222
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:20,667
Three fingers only.

1223
01:22:22,267 --> 01:22:26,767
They are the focus for the
light that flows through you.

1224
01:22:26,767 --> 01:22:29,533
This is the basis
for true magic.

1225
01:22:34,567 --> 01:22:37,567
You are a channel for the light.

1226
01:22:37,567 --> 01:22:41,067
Charge yourself with
the light and fire it

1227
01:22:42,067 --> 01:22:43,667
deep into her body,

1228
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:47,133
into her spirit.

1229
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,800
Your battle with
yourself must end now.

1230
01:22:59,267 --> 01:23:00,100
Let it go,

1231
01:23:01,767 --> 01:23:03,767
accept your own oneness.

1232
01:23:30,133 --> 01:23:31,967
- Oh Thomas, how long?

1233
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,100
- Nearly 12 hours.

1234
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:37,167
Shh.

1235
01:23:37,167 --> 01:23:38,600
- Oh that's long.

1236
01:23:40,267 --> 01:23:41,333
And the 18th,

1237
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,700
the 18th, we have to stop them.

1238
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:46,367
- Shh, relax,
everything's alright now.

1239
01:23:46,367 --> 01:23:47,767
- We have to stop them.

1240
01:23:47,767 --> 01:23:49,033
- It's alright.

1241
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:55,967
- She okay?

1242
01:23:56,967 --> 01:23:58,133
- She will be.

1243
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,867
- The cops think
she killed Rita,

1244
01:24:02,867 --> 01:24:04,533
and that puerco Ray.

1245
01:24:06,367 --> 01:24:08,533
- Don't believe it.

1246
01:24:08,533 --> 01:24:09,467
- I didn't.

1247
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:13,733
- I'm sorry about Rita.

1248
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,400
- Found this number
in her dressing room.

1249
01:24:26,700 --> 01:24:29,033
Rita wanted to stop the war.

1250
01:24:34,233 --> 01:24:36,400
She wanted to have my son.

1251
01:24:39,733 --> 01:24:42,433
I ain't afraid of dyin',

1252
01:24:42,433 --> 01:24:44,200
It's just--

1253
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:47,700
- It's just sometimes
it's harder to live.

1254
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,633
- Those people you're after,

1255
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:59,233
we're supposed to meet
'em at Aztecarte tomorrow.

1256
01:24:59,233 --> 01:25:01,933
-  I know where it is.

1257
01:25:01,933 --> 01:25:05,533
- At six a.m., that's
three hours from now.

1258
01:25:07,867 --> 01:25:09,433
- Thank you Hector.

1259
01:25:12,467 --> 01:25:16,067
- Hey, if you can't stop them
from selling more weapons

1260
01:25:16,067 --> 01:25:18,167
to the Icemen, then we're
gonna have to get some more

1261
01:25:18,167 --> 01:25:19,633
weapons of our own.

1262
01:25:19,633 --> 01:25:21,733
You hear what I'm saying?

1263
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:29,967
(bleeping key tones)

1264
01:25:32,467 --> 01:25:35,133
- I'm calling for Agent Decklin.

1265
01:25:36,767 --> 01:25:38,767
- My people are
close by, what's up?

1266
01:25:38,767 --> 01:25:39,933
- One of the gangs are supposed

1267
01:25:39,933 --> 01:25:42,200
to show up at six to make a buy.

1268
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:44,900
Yamata is selling military
weapons, isn't he?

1269
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:45,900
Heavy stuff.

1270
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:48,367
- It's all the stuff
we left in Vietnam.

1271
01:25:48,367 --> 01:25:49,833
He's been smuggling
out of the Philippines

1272
01:25:49,833 --> 01:25:51,967
and Japan for about a year now.

1273
01:25:51,967 --> 01:25:54,400
- You coulda told me.

1274
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,867
- Huh, don't know
who you can trust.

1275
01:25:57,867 --> 01:26:01,267
- I haven't checked
the building out yet.

1276
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,700
(scuffling grumbles)

1277
01:26:33,333 --> 01:26:35,700
- It's nothing personal.

1278
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:37,367
Get back to loading.

1279
01:26:37,367 --> 01:26:39,633
- Why for God's sake?

1280
01:26:39,633 --> 01:26:42,800
- It's the oldest
reason in the world.

1281
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:48,500
We're just your average cops
and feds who like to get paid.

1282
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,767
And believe me, prejudice pays.

1283
01:26:55,267 --> 01:26:57,667
Black, white, Asian, Chicano.

1284
01:26:58,967 --> 01:27:00,367
Doesn't matter, everybody's
killing each other

1285
01:27:00,367 --> 01:27:02,533
for a few blocks of
crumby territory.

1286
01:27:02,533 --> 01:27:05,167
(racking gun)

1287
01:27:05,167 --> 01:27:07,633
Might take this show
on the road, you know?

1288
01:27:07,633 --> 01:27:12,333
Detroit, Chicago, New York,
endless possibilities.

1289
01:27:12,333 --> 01:27:15,100
I wanted to send
you home, you know?

1290
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:19,267
But my partners, they said
specially to keep you here.

1291
01:27:20,667 --> 01:27:23,967
I figure they want to
deal with you personally.

1292
01:27:23,967 --> 01:27:26,467
(ringing hit)

1293
01:27:28,233 --> 01:27:29,300
- Finish him.

1294
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,833
- The favor, Yamatasan.

1295
01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:42,900
I want to take my
time with this one.

1296
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:55,233
When you beg for
death, I will kill you.

1297
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,400
Then just for fun, I
will kill the old man.

1298
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:10,000
(booming skirmish)

1299
01:28:11,567 --> 01:28:14,633
(resounding gunshot)

1300
01:28:16,133 --> 01:28:19,233
(repetitive gunfire)

1301
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:32,567
(rending fabric)

1302
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,567
(battle cries)

1303
01:29:23,033 --> 01:29:26,033
-  Drop
the gun, right now.

1304
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:30,200
- Jesus, Meisler.

1305
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,900
I was just about to drop
the net on Hoshino--

1306
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,467
- Shut up, Decklin.

1307
01:29:43,100 --> 01:29:45,367
I had you under
surveillance for months,

1308
01:29:45,367 --> 01:29:47,100
but I had to use one
of my best detectives

1309
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:48,633
and I was afraid she
was gonna blow it

1310
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:52,000
before I found out how many
cops you had in your pocket.

1311
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,733
We just busted 'em
all about an hour ago.

1312
01:29:54,733 --> 01:29:57,033
You're the only one left.

1313
01:29:57,033 --> 01:29:58,233
- Listen jack, if you
think I'm gonna take

1314
01:29:58,233 --> 01:29:59,233
this shit from you, you are--

1315
01:29:59,233 --> 01:30:01,733
(booming hit)

1316
01:30:02,867 --> 01:30:04,267
- Oh I hate feds.

1317
01:30:06,667 --> 01:30:08,500
Read 'em their rights.

1318
01:30:40,933 --> 01:30:41,767
- Hoshino,

1319
01:30:44,133 --> 01:30:46,100
first the head will swim,

1320
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:47,600
then the hero die.

1321
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:54,733
(hostile smack)

1322
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,800
(weary groan)

1323
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:17,267
You are improving Hoshino.

1324
01:31:17,267 --> 01:31:19,867
Now watch, watch what I can do.

1325
01:31:21,300 --> 01:31:23,967
(dark chanting)

1326
01:31:28,033 --> 01:31:30,467
(battle cry)

1327
01:31:38,567 --> 01:31:40,300
So, you have learned.

1328
01:31:41,633 --> 01:31:44,400
Now you think you can kill me.

1329
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,167
But I am you Hoshino.

1330
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,933
- Wrong, I know
exactly who I am,

1331
01:31:51,967 --> 01:31:53,800
and you're a dead man.

1332
01:31:54,733 --> 01:31:57,367
(dark chanting)

1333
01:32:05,567 --> 01:32:08,500
(scuffling grunts)

1334
01:32:24,367 --> 01:32:26,867
(booming hit)

1335
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,833
(screaming cries)

1336
01:32:52,367 --> 01:32:55,133
(explosive blast)

1337
01:33:10,967 --> 01:33:13,467
(cocking gun)

1338
01:33:14,567 --> 01:33:16,200
(speaking in foreign language)

1339
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:19,033
(echoing gunshot)

1340
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,767
- What?

1341
01:33:21,767 --> 01:33:23,467
Never seen a ghost before?

1342
01:33:23,467 --> 01:33:25,267
- He's mine!

1343
01:33:25,267 --> 01:33:28,100
(battling groans)

1344
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:45,533
- Thomas!

1345
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:00,067
Look out.

1346
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,433
(laser ring)

1347
01:34:07,133 --> 01:34:09,967
- And there is
nothing you can do.

1348
01:34:17,867 --> 01:34:19,800
- Dangerous, ah, this
was a piece of cake.

1349
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,200
You wanna talk about dangerous,

1350
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,700
you gotta talk about a
thug named Frank Guy.

1351
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:26,667
Fast Frank could shoot the
eyes out of a field, 20 yards.

1352
01:34:26,667 --> 01:34:29,000
He was a real criminal,

1353
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,833
but I busted him.

1354
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:32,833
You ladies like a drink?

1355
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:37,700
- Hey, captain,
you're lookin' good.

1356
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:49,267
- Thomas, if you don't dance
with this woman, I will.

1357
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:55,067
- I do have a flight to catch.

1358
01:34:55,067 --> 01:34:57,133
- That is hours from now.

1359
01:35:04,067 --> 01:35:06,033
- I never really
learned how to dance.

1360
01:35:06,033 --> 01:35:08,300
- Yeah, well I'll teach ya.

1361
01:35:11,767 --> 01:35:12,933
But first, um,

1362
01:35:15,133 --> 01:35:18,000
I think it's time
I let go of this.

1363
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,400
I really want you to have it.

1364
01:35:23,467 --> 01:35:25,100
- I will not forget

1365
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,000
my American

1366
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:29,633
partner.

1367
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:36,733
- Well, it's a small world.

1368
01:35:36,733 --> 01:35:38,633
I wouldn't be surprised

1369
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:42,067
if we bumped into
each other some day.

1370
01:35:42,067 --> 01:35:43,467
- Neither would I.

1371
01:35:43,467 --> 01:35:45,500
* Who's to say

1372
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:47,467
* If the mountains will forever

1373
01:35:47,467 --> 01:35:51,033
- Relax, dancing is
like moving meditation.

1374
01:35:54,433 --> 01:35:57,367
* Who's to say

1375
01:35:57,367 --> 01:36:01,533
* As we gaze into
the face of destiny

1376
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,967
* There's danger here

1377
01:36:08,967 --> 01:36:12,133
* We must endure
this longest night

1378
01:36:12,133 --> 01:36:14,867
* Never fear

1379
01:36:14,867 --> 01:36:19,033
* Because our love is
like the Red Sun Rising

1380
01:36:24,767 --> 01:36:27,533
* And it's older than the ages

1381
01:36:27,533 --> 01:36:29,833
* Never endin' never changes

1382
01:36:29,833 --> 01:36:32,600
* Red Sun Rising

1383
01:36:36,567 --> 01:36:39,300
* Like the ocean and the shore

1384
01:36:39,300 --> 01:36:43,133
* We'll be joined forevermore

1385
01:37:00,400 --> 01:37:03,100
* I believe

1386
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:07,267
* There are stars just
as far as you can see

1387
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,067
* And I believe

1388
01:37:15,067 --> 01:37:19,233
* In your heart there's
a secret place for me

1389
01:37:23,967 --> 01:37:27,000
* Story goes

1390
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:29,933
* Two ships passing in the night

1391
01:37:29,933 --> 01:37:32,733
* But heaven knows

1392
01:37:32,733 --> 01:37:34,900
* I will return just like

1393
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:37,967
* The Red Sun Rising

1394
01:37:41,967 --> 01:37:45,300
* 'Cause it's
older than the ages

1395
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:47,700
* Never ends and never changes

1396
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:50,467
* Red Sun Rising

1397
01:37:54,467 --> 01:37:57,300
* And we will survive this night

1398
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:59,367
* Because our love is like

1399
01:37:59,367 --> 01:38:02,133
* Red Sun Rising

1400
01:38:05,933 --> 01:38:09,367
* Our love was
always meant to be

1401
01:38:09,367 --> 01:38:11,100
* For all eternity

1402
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:13,867
* Red Sun Rising

1403
01:38:17,900 --> 01:38:21,000
* Like the ocean and the shore

1404
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,900
* We'll be joined forever more

1405
01:39:08,167 --> 01:39:11,000
* Red Sun Rising
