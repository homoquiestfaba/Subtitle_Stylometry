- Thanks.

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,625
So on our TV show,

4
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:14,625
- will it show us
- having sex?

5
00:00:14,667 --> 00:00:16,292
Oh, yeah, like, a lot.

6
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,625
Yeah.

7
00:00:17,667 --> 00:00:18,938
I guess I feel

8
00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:20,208
two ways about that.

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,417
I mean, I think

10
00:00:21,418 --> 00:00:22,583
it's very important

11
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:23,813
to show two women...

12
00:00:23,814 --> 00:00:25,000
I don't know...

13
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:26,125
Being casually intimate

14
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,208
with each other.

15
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,167
But also, like, it's us,

16
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,875
- and we're, like,
- real people.

17
00:00:31,917 --> 00:00:33,542
We're a couple.

18
00:00:33,583 --> 00:00:34,625
Yeah.

19
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:35,896
Well, but if

20
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:37,125
we don't do it,

21
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:38,167
then it's like

22
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:39,168
no actual lesbians

23
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,313
are on TV having sex

24
00:00:40,314 --> 00:00:41,417
with other women,

25
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,646
and then there's

26
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,833
no women on TV

27
00:00:42,647 --> 00:00:43,833
also, like,

28
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:45,417
- having sex with
- other women period.

29
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:47,125
- I mean, like,
- maybe that happens,

30
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:48,646
But then, like,

31
00:00:47,167 --> 00:00:50,125
or they both die.

32
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:50,125
one of them dies,

33
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:51,958
- Like they're warlords,
- and then they die,

34
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,188
Or they, like,

35
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,375

- at school, and they die.

00:00:56,125 --> 00:00:58,000
- They are - an art professor,
- And they die.

39
00:00:58,042 --> 00:00:59,333
Was she a professor?

40
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:01,104
Anyway, my point is

41
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:02,833
I just want us to live.

43
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,250
- CAMERON: You know - what else we should
- Talk about

44
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:13,417
Is that when we drove

45
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:14,542
RHEA: Mm-hmm.

46
00:01:13,418 --> 00:01:14,542
out here, we had...

47
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,375
- We drove two cars - in tandem with
- Walkie-talkies.

48
00:01:16,417 --> 00:01:17,917
- Walkie-talkies.
- And we pulled off

49
00:01:17,958 --> 00:01:19,917
- At a scenic...
- Like, in Utah?

50
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,042
Where we in Utah?

00:01:21,043 --> 00:01:22,083
Who can ever tell?

52
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,333
- Somewhere scenic,
- and then this car

53
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:24,750
- Drove up behind...
- Third car.

00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:26,667
- To be in this rest area.
- Indeed.

00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:26,708
I got that shirt

186
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,083
17 years old

187
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:28,083
when I was

188
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:29,875
- at a thrift store
- for $2.00,

189
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:30,917
And then I lost it

190
00:04:29,917 --> 00:04:31,917
of my dresser

191
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:31,917
in the back

192
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,167
- until my mom
- found it.

193
00:04:33,208 --> 00:04:35,042
- I cried when she
- shipped it to me.

194
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,125
And now some woman

195
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:37,167
in a sundress

196
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,500
is gonna

197
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,792
of you in it.

198
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:39,792
post a picture

199
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:40,979
Oh, my God.

200
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:42,125
about this shirt.

201
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,125
I don't even care

202
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:43,542
- I just care
- about Melina Marquez.

203
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:44,792
Just switch with me.

204
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:45,917
I... Okay. I mean...

205
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:46,917
[groans] God.

206
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,292
- Still technically
- my shirt.

207
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,667
Ah, so?

208
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:50,979
Oh, you look cute

209
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,250
in your little undie shirt.

210
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,375
- This is
- sexual harassment.

211
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:54,375
I am at work.

212
00:04:54,417 --> 00:04:55,500
Well, you should sue me.

213
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:56,875
- Well, your dad's
- my lawyer.

214
00:04:56,917 --> 00:04:57,938
Sounds like a real

215
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:58,958
conflict of interest.

216
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,958
Mm-hmm.

217
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,333
[sniffs]

218
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,583
That smells like you.

219
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:06,500
Veggie bacon.

220
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,000
- KENT: Dude,
- I'm telling you, man.

221
00:05:10,042 --> 00:05:11,417
- It's like Pryor,
- then Louis C.K.,

222
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,750
Then you, dude.

223
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:14,042
You're right there.

224
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,250
Thank you.

225
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:16,417
Yo, Cam,

226
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,250
- why is your audience
- so chick-heavy?

227
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:19,792
Seriously, there were,

228
00:05:18,292 --> 00:05:21,292
in the front row

229
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:21,292
like, three girls

230
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,958
- giving me
- resting bitch face.

231
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,521
Like the whole time

232
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,042
the 17-minute mark?

233
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:26,042
or after you hit

234
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,542
- Please don't say,
- "Bitch face."

235
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,792
Why not? You know what?

236
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm glad you said that.

237
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:32,125
- Explain to me
- the rape fantasy then, okay?

238
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:33,958
- 'Cause women,
- you're in bed with 'em,

239
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,500
- They want you
- to call 'em bitch,

240
00:05:35,542 --> 00:05:37,208
- But then, like,
- when you're anywhere else,

241
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,917
- You can't
- call 'em bitch anymore?

242
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,354
I don't even

243
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:41,750
unpacking this for you.

244
00:05:40,355 --> 00:05:41,750
know how to begin

245
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:43,417
- I'm not gonna try.
- Please don't.

246
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,083
Just explain what the fuck

247
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:48,708
this is instead.

248
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,875
RHEA: Uh...

249
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:51,417
[laughs] Shit.

250
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:52,688
Rhea, you look

251
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:53,917
like James Dean.

252
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,750
Sorry for the insult.

253
00:05:57,792 --> 00:05:59,209
Oh, God.

254
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,625
Why does Kent exist?

255
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,042
But seriously, though,

256
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:03,417
what is that poster?

257
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:05,083
- Oh, I had it made
- for the theater,

258
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,875
- 'cause we're more
- than just girlfriends.

259
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:07,917
We're comics

260
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:08,918
with our own show.

261
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,146
We're James Deans,

262
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:11,333
remember?

263
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,542
He doesn't even realize

264
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:13,708
that's a compliment.

265
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,333
It is a bit much.

266
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,333
I like it.

267
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm gonna do time, okay?

268
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:19,542
- I just feel like
- Melina's here.

269
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:20,958
- Honestly,
- I'm thinking about it

270
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,146
As if it's an audition

271
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:23,292
for her next movie.

272
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,167
- Of course. - Why wouldn't
- A stand-up comic

273
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:26,333
Go into outer space

274
00:06:26,334 --> 00:06:27,458
with Melina Marquez?

275
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,125
- Yeah, that's what
- I'm saying.

276
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:30,625
[cheering]

277
00:06:39,542 --> 00:06:40,959
Hey. Hey,

278
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,375
sorry I'm late.

279
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,458
Oh, hey, Dave.

280
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,917
What the fuck is that?

281
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,542
- Hey, Rhea,
- I'm next, right?

282
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:48,833
Yep. Mm-hmm.

283
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,896
Oh, Bob,

284
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:50,917
do you know Dave?

285
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:52,083
No.

286
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,959
Ladies and gentlemen,

287
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,417
Mr. Bob Herzog.

288
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,375
- Give it up for Bob.
- [cheering]

289
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,125
Hello, you gorgeous,

290
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,750
soulless fuckers.

291
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:08,792
Cameron Esposito,

292
00:07:08,793 --> 00:07:09,793
everybody.

293
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,042
She's kind of funny.

294
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,500
[laughter]

295
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:15,417
- Sexual assault's
- been in the news lately.

296
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,042
- I don't know
- if you've noticed.

297
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,250
If this year's

298
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:19,417
taught us anything,

299
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,083
it's that society

300
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:22,708
a woman's been raped

301
00:07:21,084 --> 00:07:22,708
will not believe

302
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,604
unless 48 other women

303
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:28,458
by the same guy.

304
00:07:25,605 --> 00:07:28,458
claim they were raped

305
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,708
Yeah.

306
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,271
That's why I only

307
00:07:31,272 --> 00:07:32,792
raped 47 women.

308
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:34,208
[laughter]

309
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,979
Cut it off right there.

310
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,708
That is it.

311
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,375
- I'm gonna go
- to the bathroom.

312
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,375
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

313
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:42,042
Yeah. I got it in here.

314
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,792
- Okay.
- Like a certain person

315
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:45,021
That... I don't know...

316
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,208
not have heard of.

317
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:46,208
You might or might

318
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,167
[laughter]

319
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:02,792
Oh, I'm sorry.

320
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,000
We thought this

321
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,167
restroom.

322
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:05,167
was the women's

323
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,583
I am a woman.

324
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:07,833
Oh, of course. I...

325
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,667
- You're in
- a different shirt.

326
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,083
Yeah. It's my shirt.

327
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,375
They're all my shirts.

328
00:08:15,375 --> 00:08:17,000
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

329
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:18,375
Oh, no, no, no.

330
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:19,708
Come on in. Have a seat.

331
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,875
This is my office. Heh.

332
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:24,063
Yeah. So I'm so sorry

333
00:08:24,064 --> 00:08:25,208
about earlier.

334
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,417
- I feel like
- I blew you off.

335
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,333
- I didn't know
- you were you.

336
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,833
- Oh, no,
- Cameron is right.

337
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,125
I'm too quiet.

338
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:32,833
- She would never - let herself
- Be ignored

339
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:34,375
Or seen

340
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:35,875
in her own clothes.

341
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:37,271
If I could tell myself

342
00:08:37,272 --> 00:08:38,625
not to fall for people

343
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,730
that I would have

344
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:42,792
for the rest of my life,

345
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:42,792
to be telling jokes with

346
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,208
I wouldn't, you know?

347
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,583
Maybe one.

348
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:46,833
Six.

349
00:08:46,875 --> 00:08:48,833
- But that's
- how I found myself

350
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:50,271
And a very good remedy

351
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:51,667
for U.T.I.s

352
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,958
and my comedic voice.

353
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Wow.

354
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:56,500
I love your voice.

355
00:08:56,542 --> 00:08:57,896
It's how I imagine

356
00:08:57,897 --> 00:08:59,250
God's voice would sound.

357
00:08:59,292 --> 00:09:00,708
Ohh.

358
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,250
There is no God,

359
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,105
but that's why you need

360
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:05,917
to speak up for yourself,

361
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,333
'cause you're super-duper.

362
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,125
You're fantastical, okay?

363
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:10,313
And, uh,

364
00:09:10,314 --> 00:09:11,458
you can use my office.

365
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,833
- Pens are free.
- Great.

366
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:14,250
- What's the Wi-Fi
- password?

367
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:15,355
Uh, officepeepo.

368
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:16,417
Great.

369
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,583
Do you want to stay

370
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:18,708
for the rest?

371
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,834
Please no. Honestly,

372
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,917
I like comedy.

373
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:20,917
I don't think

374
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,125
RHEA: Ah, come on.

375
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:23,458
Oh, you're funny, though.

376
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,375
Thank you.

377
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:26,584
Hey, you wanna go home

378
00:09:26,585 --> 00:09:27,750
and watch "Carol"?

379
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:29,083
- For the third time
- this week?

380
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,188
Okay, Therese.

381
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:31,250
[cell phone chimes]

382
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:32,500
Oh, God,

383
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:33,708
must be so hard.

384
00:09:32,501 --> 00:09:33,708
being a stand-up

385
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,042
- I could never
- do that job.

386
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,104
Yeah. Babe, can you

387
00:09:36,105 --> 00:09:37,125
drop me at the E.R.?

388
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:38,188
Some idiot broke his jaw

389
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:39,208
in a bar fight.

390
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,479
Sure. I'll spend time

391
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,708
without you.

392
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,708
with Cate Blanchett

393
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,458
Hey, are you okay?

394
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,625
Oh, yeah. I mean,

395
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:50,417
- I just got sirred
- in the bathroom,

396
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,375
- But I did get to talk
- to Maria, so...

397
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:54,375
- Sweet.
- It's okay.

398
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:55,875
I don't understand.

399
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:57,333
to use the word "bitch,"

400
00:09:55,876 --> 00:09:57,333
If I'm not allowed

401
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,104
then what am I supposed

402
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,833
a crazy bitch?

403
00:09:59,105 --> 00:10:00,833
to do when I meet

404
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,354
Ooh, I'm not okay

405
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,833
"crazy." Yeah.

406
00:10:02,355 --> 00:10:03,833
with you using

407
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:04,958
Me either.

408
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,958
- I'm surrounded.
- Mm-hmm.

409
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,625
- Yeah, man.
- Read the room.

410
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,333
- Uh, Maria,
- you are on next,

411
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,500
So what do you need

412
00:10:11,501 --> 00:10:12,625
to get pumped up?

413
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:13,958
- Like French fries,
- waffles?

414
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,958
- Like, nothing.
- Water?

415
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,250
I'm okay. I'm okay.

416
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:17,875
- You know what?
- I'll take a water, Cam.

417
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,458
Oh, yeah. Okay.

418
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,708
Thank you.

419
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,333
We gotta go.

420
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,542
[cheering]

421
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,500
[Bob continues indistinctly]

422
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:31,417
you know,

423
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:32,667
off the top of my head.

424
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,500
- You guys are okay.
- I was awesome.

425
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:36,500
- Have a great night.
- Thank you so much.

426
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:38,458
[cheering]

427
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:42,167
Oh, guys.

428
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,271
Keep it going

429
00:10:43,272 --> 00:10:44,333
for Bob Herzog.

430
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:45,604
Man.

431
00:10:45,605 --> 00:10:46,833
Hoo.

432
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,250
Spicing up the stage.

433
00:10:48,292 --> 00:10:49,750
- Spicy.
- Speaking of which,

434
00:10:49,792 --> 00:10:51,208
- I'm wearing
- a different shirt.

435
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,125
- This shirt is also
- a little spicy,

436
00:10:53,167 --> 00:10:54,334
'cause it used to be

437
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,500
on your body. We switched.

438
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:56,688
We switched, 'cause

439
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,833
Whitesnake is a band

440
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:59,438
that only Rhea

441
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:01,000
knows about apparently.

442
00:11:01,042 --> 00:11:02,375
[laughter]

443
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:04,125
Right, Rhea?

444
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:05,667
Oh, I'm sorry.

445
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:07,583
- I'm just, uh, reliving
- past personal trauma

446
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,333
- Through the, uh,
- rape jokes

447
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,688
And rape conversation

448
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,000
tonight.

449
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:12,000
that's been going on

450
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:13,625
Oh, yeah. Yeah,

451
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:15,208
at this show.

452
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:15,208
a lot of rape

453
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,396
Not... That's

454
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,542
to say that,

455
00:11:16,397 --> 00:11:17,542
the wrong way

456
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,125
- but onstage and
- conversationally.

457
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,313
Why is it that

458
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:21,458
the only dudes

459
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,625
that will talk

460
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,750
dude comics,

461
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:23,750
about rape are

462
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:25,750
- and then it's just,
- like, all the time?

463
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:27,500
- All the time.
- I mean, it is...

464
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:29,375
- It's dude comics,
- but then it's also,

465
00:11:29,417 --> 00:11:30,750
Like, dude TV writers

466
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:32,083
and dude screenwriters

467
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,438
and dude book writers,

468
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:34,750
you know, writer writers.

469
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:35,938
Right, comic books,

470
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:37,083
all that stuff.

471
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:37,083
claymation,

472
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,625
All that stuff.

473
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:39,688
I think

474
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,708
is entertainment.

475
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:40,708
it's because rape

476
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,938
Yeah. I mean, what would

477
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:43,125
female characters be doing

478
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,792
- if they weren't
- getting raped?

479
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh, um, wait.

480
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,625
- Marrying a man...
- Mm-hmm.

481
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,458
Or having a baby...

482
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,458
Yes.

483
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,417
- Or she marries
- a woman,

484
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:56,938
Then she cheats

485
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:58,417
with a man,

486
00:11:56,939 --> 00:11:58,417
on the woman

487
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,083
- gets pregnant,
- has that baby,

488
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,500
- Kisses a woman,
- dies.

489
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:02,792
[laughter]

490
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,125
- Those are
- the stories.

491
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:05,333
- Those are all
- woman things.

492
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,375
[laughter]

493
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,375
- Oh, but you know
- what is not...

494
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:10,125
- Hmm?
- Just a woman thing?

495
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,500
- Rape.
- Oh, yeah.

496
00:12:11,542 --> 00:12:12,750
- That's
- for everybody.

497
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:14,042
Rape is for everybody.

498
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:17,771
Kind of nice gift

499
00:12:17,772 --> 00:12:19,000
to us all.

500
00:12:19,042 --> 00:12:20,063
From statistically

501
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:21,083
mostly men.

502
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,208
Yeah, mostly men.

503
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,917
- Gotta bring that up
- at the end.

504
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,875
- You guys, - we got a great
- Final comic...

505
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,458
- [cheering]
- on the show tonight.

506
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,125
- You are
- gonna love her.

507
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:30,833
- She's a personal
- favorite of mine.

508
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:31,875
I admire her very much.

509
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,333
She's a real legend.

510
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,542
Let's hear it

511
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:35,708
Maria Bamford.

512
00:12:34,543 --> 00:12:35,708
right now for

513
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,667
[cheering]

514
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:43,167
- [growled whisper]
- Gonna get you.

515
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,125
I'm getting you.

516
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,250
I'm getting you.

517
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,625
[laughter]

518
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:51,917
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

519
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,042
Oh, I would love

520
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,125
with someone.

521
00:12:53,043 --> 00:12:54,125
to sleep in

522
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,083
- That sounds
- so romantic.

523
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,125
I don't know.

524
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:58,271
But we are

525
00:12:58,272 --> 00:12:59,375
fostering a rooster,

526
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:00,750
and he knows

527
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:02,083
his job, okay?

528
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,542
Is there anything better

529
00:13:03,543 --> 00:13:04,958
than Maria Bamford?

530
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,375
No, not at all.

531
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:07,563
It's like the show's

532
00:13:07,564 --> 00:13:08,708
bananas all night,

533
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,708
and then just Maria.

534
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,959
I love doing this show.

535
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,167
I know.

536
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,813
I love doing this show

537
00:13:15,814 --> 00:13:17,417
with you also,

538
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:19,708
'cause I love you.

539
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,313
Hey, gang, here's

540
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,875
I just overheard.

541
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:22,875
a funny thing

542
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:24,875
- Um, "Final comic
- of the night."

543
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:26,458
- "Final comic
- of the night"?

544
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,292
- Oh, Dave,
- we forgot about you.

545
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,125
- Guys, I blew off
- a Sadie Hawkins dance

546
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,667
- For this
- that I was chaperoning,

547
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:32,792
And you know how much

548
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,875
at school

549
00:13:32,793 --> 00:13:33,875
I like the energy

550
00:13:33,917 --> 00:13:35,292
- when the girls are
- asking the boys.

551
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:36,833
- Ah, Dave, I'm sorry.
- Hey, uh,

552
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,042
We'll go

553
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:39,208
tell everybody

554
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:39,208
out there and just

555
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,417
- we have a surprise
- headliner,

556
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:42,375
- And you can go on
- after Maria Bamford.

557
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:44,042
- Oh, fuck you. - I can't follow
- Maria Bamford.

558
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,542
- Come on.
- Yeah.

559
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,333
- Actually that's, like,
- legitimately a bad idea.

560
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,167
- Is that funny?
- How long you been doing this?

561
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,625
- Like three years?
- One year.

562
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:52,167
- Rhea, don't...
- I'm looking for something.

563
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,417
Oh, there. I found it,

564
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:54,625

568
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,708
Shut up.

569
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,167
- No, you say that
- for every show.

570
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,625

- Oh, yeah.

579
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:16,558
- Yeah, he...
- He's a huge fan of yours.

580
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:17,604
He's the reason I saw you

581
00:14:17,605 --> 00:14:18,625
in the first place.

582
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:19,834

583

Hi. Good.

589

- Okay. Well, this is
- Melina Marquez,

593
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:33,855

that the three of us

595
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,958

Such great stuff. Heh.

Yeah. No, you just

598
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:41,583
have such, um...

599
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,000

600
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:44,375
It's great.

This is Rhea.

608
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,125
Kent likes me?

609
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:03,396
That's what

610
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,625

Ecch. Yes, a lot.

621
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,458

- To space?

00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,542
- I don't know.
- Or the deep sea?

657
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:21,000
How about when she's

658
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:22,417
in deep sea in deep space?

659
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:23,792
I know! How'd they get

660
00:16:23,793 --> 00:16:25,125

665
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:44,875
No. I showed it to Mike.

666
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:46,125
He was like,

667
00:16:46,167 --> 00:16:47,355
"No, I don't want that,"

668
00:16:47,356 --> 00:16:48,542

00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:50,208
- God, some people
- have no taste.

670
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,708
- Well, I don't know
- about that.

671
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,458
- You guys valet?
- Don't you know

- Super rude.
- I don't give a shit.

678

- could get dinner.

682
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,042
That sounds terrible.

683
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,583

- venues worthy of me.

687
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:17,042
Actually, Cameron,

688
00:17:17,043 --> 00:17:19,000
