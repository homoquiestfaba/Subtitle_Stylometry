1
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:05,536
Coming through angels, 19!

2
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:08,209
Take it easy, Viper One.
Don't push it.

3
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:10,969
Throttling back. 18,5.

4
00:02:11,147 --> 00:02:12,375
2500 RPM.

5
00:02:14,484 --> 00:02:17,044
Airspeed... Airspeed needle stuck.

6
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:19,717
But we're still in the green. 17,5.

7
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,820
Heck!

8
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,560
15,5.

9
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:35,568
Sir, I know what you will say, but
if anyone can land it, McCormick can.

10
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,069
- Danny here?
- In the plane.

11
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,710
It's sticking! We're in a dive.

12
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:45,179
It's 12,5 and she's purring.

13
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,076
Bring it back, Viper One.

14
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,512
Roger!

15
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,185
Serious fluttering.

16
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,747
Controls are resisting.
Full nose-up trim!

17
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,689
Slip it in, Viper One!
Come on, slip it in!

18
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,692
It's too much!

19
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,033
Pull her back!

20
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,833
Oh, brother!

21
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:19,515
Oh, brother!

22
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,944
That's it!

23
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:51,078
If she has a warranty, I'll take her!

24
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,977
Doesn't seem to need that.

25
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:57,742
Don't be married to these
Pratt & Whitneys.

26
00:03:57,921 --> 00:04:00,856
Plane needs classic engines. Have it
ready tonight.

27
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:02,285
Did you see that?

28
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,483
What, Danny? See what?

29
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:08,654
McCormick. Three "c"s.

30
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:11,927
- The damnedest thing happened up there.
- Dizzy?

31
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:13,432
- Feel lightheaded?
- No.

32
00:04:13,603 --> 00:04:14,934
I had a heart attack.

33
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:16,765
- Didn't it look good?
- Queasiness?

34
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,001
No. I thought you were in hiding
until you finished your thing.

35
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,940
- Blackout?
- No blackouts.

36
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:26,172
- Don't work for the airline, okay?
- Thought I wouldn't pull up?

37
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,011
- It crossed my mind.
- It crossed mine too.

38
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,516
Headache? Chest pain?

39
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,451
No. I was close enough
to see your license plate.

40
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:36,615
All of a sudden, in the midst
of it all, I saw Helen.

41
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,291
A vision?!

42
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:39,788
Vomit?

43
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:44,125
No, no vomit. I'm talking to my friend.
We can do Q and A later.

44
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,530
Anything you say. Nice landing.

45
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:51,035
I thought, "She's coming home tonight.
Pull up!" I hit the ground!

46
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,368
I'm hungry! Want some ribs?

47
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,532
What?

48
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,043
- I'm here because it worked.
- It worked?

49
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,807
Rough around the edges, but it worked!

50
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,156
That's incredible!

51
00:05:08,324 --> 00:05:09,985
No one can know, okay?

52
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:11,649
Of course.

53
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,163
- We can tell Helen.
- Helen can know. But nobody else.

54
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:18,061
It's really sort of incredible. It is.

55
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,395
- Where is he?
- Back at the lab.

56
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:23,661
- We'll celebrate!
- Great!

57
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,835
I'm driving.

58
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,037
Sure, okay.

59
00:05:31,347 --> 00:05:32,905
Better be okay.

60
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,249
Who is that?

61
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,829
I'm sorry I'm so late.

62
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,467
- What time is it?
- Almost two.

63
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:02,260
I was going to go to my place.

64
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:05,134
But I wanted to see you.
I hope you don't mind.

65
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,443
I kind of do. Would you leave, please?

66
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,119
You taste like champagne.

67
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:28,695
Harry and I got a bit drunk.

68
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,197
A celebration?

69
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,800
Kind of.

70
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:41,373
You're hungry.

71
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:42,810
I know.

72
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,310
So, what were you celebrating?

73
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,881
Let me guess.

74
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,210
Harry's 400th consecutive hour
in the laboratory.

75
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:54,547
Close, but no cigar.

76
00:07:55,658 --> 00:07:56,818
How is it?

77
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,888
I've been eating dust for 4 days!

78
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,664
So?

79
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,898
What were you celebrating?

80
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,663
Why wasn't I invited?

81
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:11,830
We would've, if you were here.

82
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:14,734
Harry froze a chicken.

83
00:08:15,511 --> 00:08:17,445
Big deal. So has my butcher.

84
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,573
I bet your butcher's never
brought the chicken to life again.

85
00:08:23,686 --> 00:08:25,244
He what?!

86
00:08:25,688 --> 00:08:30,250
I swear! I saw the chicken
walking around. Harry's a genius!

87
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,520
Which he proclaimed after
the second bottle of champagne.

88
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:38,427
So, what, this is some big government
chicken conspiracy or something?

89
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,365
Don't take this lightly.
Don't tell anyone.

90
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,238
Just my mother.

91
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,373
Helen, no, you can't.

92
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:48,438
- I was kidding.
- Promise me.

93
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,203
Yeah. I promise.

94
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,538
I promise.

95
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,113
- Not even under torture.
- No.

96
00:08:54,383 --> 00:08:57,750
Not even under
incredibly painful torture?

97
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,314
Don't.

98
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:04,125
This is a matter of national security.
I'm sorry, but I must tickle you.

99
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,727
- I'm not kidding.
- I must know...

100
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,389
- I'll scream!
- It's for your own good!

101
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,793
Not the knees!

102
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,844
- Got it!
- Good catch!

103
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,452
When the man on second base
touches him with the ball, he's out.

104
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:05,780
But why is he running?

105
00:10:06,088 --> 00:10:07,715
Let's start again.

106
00:10:16,632 --> 00:10:17,963
Here we go.

107
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,207
This kid keeps staring at me.

108
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:35,306
He likes you.

109
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:47,386
Folks? Everybody?

110
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,556
We have an announcement
we'd like to make. Blanche and I...

111
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,337
Next year
Blanche'll celebrate Mother's Day.

112
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:02,070
Congratulations, Blanche.

113
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,080
I'd have told you but we weren't sure.

114
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,242
A toast! A toast! To Harry Junior!

115
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,887
To Harriet!

116
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,942
Look, it's 1939 already...

117
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:44,285
You usually get my thoughts before I do
so you probably know what I'll say.

118
00:11:49,058 --> 00:11:50,548
Will you marry me?

119
00:11:58,067 --> 00:11:59,796
I've been thinking...

120
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,232
- Guess what?
- What?

121
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:04,965
- Colliers wants the pictures.
- No kidding?

122
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:10,071
But it's a rush thing.
They need the pictures by Thursday.

123
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,304
I must have them ready tomorrow.

124
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,315
Which means I must get to work.
I must go!

125
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:18,144
Wait!

126
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,309
What?

127
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:21,484
Want some pie?

128
00:12:21,924 --> 00:12:23,323
We just had pie.

129
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,459
Not blueberry.

130
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,591
- How can you be hungry?
- I don't know.

131
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:28,923
Isn't that the darndest thing?

132
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,988
Some blueberry pie.

133
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,499
Want some? Just one.

134
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,206
What's going on?

135
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,674
What's going on? Nothing.

136
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,787
I just want you
to sit here with me while I eat.

137
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:55,947
I'll eat fast.

138
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:01,520
You're trying to break bad news to me,
right? You're testing a rocket?

139
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:05,133
Where do you cook this stuff up?
There's no rocket.

140
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,720
Thank you.

141
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:37,058
I must go.

142
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,399
Okay, I know.

143
00:13:43,672 --> 00:13:45,230
I'll call you later.

144
00:13:54,683 --> 00:13:56,241
Are you sure you must go?

145
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,179
Are you sure you're okay?

146
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,021
What is it?

147
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:08,186
Let's never leave this booth.

148
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,531
- You're acting nuts.
- I am?

149
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,033
More than usual.

150
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,204
I'll see you later.

151
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:27,941
What're you still doing here? Get out.

152
00:14:50,906 --> 00:14:52,396
I almost did it.

153
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,804
I just couldn't get the words
past my throat.

154
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,241
Well, you inspired me.
Tell me something.

155
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,142
When you asked Blanche...

156
00:15:04,587 --> 00:15:06,077
Really? On her head?

157
00:15:06,255 --> 00:15:07,813
And she still said yes?

158
00:15:08,257 --> 00:15:09,747
Just a sec, Frank.

159
00:15:09,925 --> 00:15:11,916
You must go outside.

160
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,031
Come on, Danny.

161
00:17:08,544 --> 00:17:11,445
Goddamn it, Danny,
will you open the door?

162
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:15,213
Please?!

163
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:08,835
After 2 weeks, they said she wouldn't
wake up. That was 6 months ago.

164
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:10,602
Doctors can be wrong.

165
00:18:10,773 --> 00:18:12,502
I talked to Dr. Morrison...

166
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:14,541
...and Kelvin and Hastings...

167
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:17,610
...and Collins.
They all say the same thing.

168
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,174
She said, "I'll see you later."

169
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:23,983
That was the last thing she said.
"I'll see you later."

170
00:18:25,954 --> 00:18:29,185
They're moving her
to a chronic care facility...

171
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,848
...in Santa Rosa.

172
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:33,284
It's a better place, I think.

173
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:38,126
The doctors all agree
nothing can be done.

174
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:42,462
We used to play out
by the lighthouse when we were kids.

175
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,631
And she'd say we'd grow old together...

176
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:51,977
...in that great house down the road.

177
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:58,643
I don't have one single memory
without her.

178
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,481
Nothing was real until she knew.

179
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:11,989
Charlie was canned from my project.

180
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:15,735
They found gin in his locker.

181
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:20,665
He tried to deny it, but he was so
sozzled he just passed out.

182
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:23,910
Six days before the test
and now he's out.

183
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:26,512
His timing was always beautiful.

184
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,010
What test?

185
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,852
What test?

186
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:33,582
My project.

187
00:19:34,022 --> 00:19:35,683
My secret project.

188
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:39,054
I was going to freeze a human.

189
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,696
If you can call Charlie a human.

190
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,194
How long?

191
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,927
A year.

192
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:50,770
See, the beautiful thing about Charlie
is, he had no life.

193
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,271
What better way to iron out the kinks.

194
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:44,188
I can't watch her die.

195
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:49,595
I want to sleep for a year.

196
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:53,098
- You've been through a lot.
- I've thought it through.

197
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:56,760
I've been in the service 12 years.
I'm healthy.

198
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:59,696
I got no family, nowhere to go.

199
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,708
I know tests. I know experiments.
It's my job.

200
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:04,703
I'm perfect.

201
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:07,445
You know that.

202
00:21:07,616 --> 00:21:10,710
I don't even know
if this thing'll work for a year.

203
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:15,546
Let me do it, please.
I can't think anymore.

204
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:17,386
I can't.

205
00:21:18,126 --> 00:21:19,286
Until she...

206
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:21,393
Until it's over.

207
00:21:22,464 --> 00:21:25,900
You said doctors can be wrong.
That's true.

208
00:21:28,136 --> 00:21:29,728
If she gets better...

209
00:21:30,572 --> 00:21:32,130
...wake me up.

210
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:44,418
Bring the internal to 20.

211
00:21:44,586 --> 00:21:45,348
21.

212
00:21:46,254 --> 00:21:47,243
20.

213
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:52,222
Cancel pulse.

214
00:21:52,494 --> 00:21:54,086
Barometer is seven.

215
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,926
- Do we have that?
- Copy.

216
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:04,333
Reduce pressure.

217
00:22:04,506 --> 00:22:05,939
How's the heart rate?

218
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,506
Hit the valve.

219
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:24,451
Record date and time.

220
00:22:24,626 --> 00:22:27,288
26 November, 1939.

221
00:22:27,796 --> 00:22:29,627
1700 hours.

222
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:32,459
All right, this is it.

223
00:22:33,135 --> 00:22:35,296
This is history.

224
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:30,585
Got the dentist tomorrow?

225
00:23:45,273 --> 00:23:46,171
Any good?

226
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:06,960
- You're good company.
- She said, yawning.

227
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:09,393
- I didn't.
- You were about to.

228
00:24:10,232 --> 00:24:11,631
Sorry.

229
00:24:15,303 --> 00:24:18,795
Sorry about dinner.
I just tend to burn things.

230
00:24:19,074 --> 00:24:21,474
No, it wasn't really burned.

231
00:24:21,643 --> 00:24:23,975
Just, you know, well-done.

232
00:24:24,479 --> 00:24:27,642
It was significantly,
dramatically well-done.

233
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:32,409
We'll do it again.

234
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:34,819
Any time. I know the maitre d'.

235
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:38,084
See you at the hospital, okay?

236
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,897
Air show this weekend.

237
00:24:50,705 --> 00:24:52,969
You can invite John if you want.

238
00:24:56,845 --> 00:24:57,937
Maybe.

239
00:24:58,113 --> 00:24:59,171
We'll see.

240
00:25:02,284 --> 00:25:03,273
'Night.

241
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,633
What's this?

242
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:25,173
It's parking.

243
00:25:25,974 --> 00:25:27,441
I thought we were going home.

244
00:25:28,376 --> 00:25:31,470
Chill out, freak.
I gotta drop something off.

245
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,141
Unlike you, I have responsibilities.

246
00:25:34,316 --> 00:25:37,080
But Mom said take us home. Directly.

247
00:25:37,986 --> 00:25:42,821
That's a real nice story, Felix, but Mom
and Dad are in Vegas and I'm not.

248
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:51,392
You move from this car...

249
00:25:51,666 --> 00:25:56,399
...and, I swear to God, one day I'll put
a poisonous snake in your bed.

250
00:26:04,412 --> 00:26:05,606
Dickhead!

251
00:26:05,847 --> 00:26:08,941
I don't think we can work
within that time frame.

252
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:14,185
We'll have to postpone construction
another week.

253
00:26:14,456 --> 00:26:17,789
And that's at the least.
We're sorting through a lot of stuff.

254
00:26:18,026 --> 00:26:19,516
I'll keep you updated.

255
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:24,693
Oh, man!

256
00:26:25,967 --> 00:26:26,956
Look!

257
00:26:40,815 --> 00:26:42,305
Race you the end?

258
00:26:50,392 --> 00:26:52,383
Hurry, there's 10 seconds left.

259
00:26:53,061 --> 00:26:54,824
Hurry! 10, 9...

260
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:55,985
...8, 7...

261
00:26:57,732 --> 00:26:59,723
I'm burning up!

262
00:27:01,503 --> 00:27:04,165
It burns! It burns!

263
00:27:05,006 --> 00:27:06,337
You okay?

264
00:27:22,924 --> 00:27:25,688
I've got my guys on it around the clock.

265
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:28,919
What can I do for you?

266
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:35,634
Give this to Samuels.
He's out front in the trailer.

267
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:37,029
Thank you.

268
00:27:37,706 --> 00:27:40,539
Roger. Temperature is one, two, three.
Ready.

269
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:43,703
Activating the turbopower speed booster.

270
00:27:43,878 --> 00:27:45,937
Prepare for radioactive energy.

271
00:27:47,716 --> 00:27:49,445
Okay. How low are we?

272
00:27:49,718 --> 00:27:51,549
The needle says 65.

273
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,482
47!

274
00:27:52,787 --> 00:27:55,221
Ready to raise the periscope?

275
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,122
Ready to raise periscope.

276
00:27:59,394 --> 00:28:01,157
A leak! Emergency!

277
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:02,318
What now?

278
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:03,828
Tighten the oxygen.

279
00:28:31,593 --> 00:28:32,924
Oh, my God!

280
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:35,087
Careful!

281
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:37,329
It's cold.

282
00:29:13,468 --> 00:29:14,400
Look!

283
00:29:16,805 --> 00:29:18,136
He's cold too.

284
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:19,796
Think he's dead?

285
00:29:23,478 --> 00:29:25,537
Get me out of this thing!

286
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:49,395
We went in and this metal thing opened,
with a dead guy inside!

287
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:52,165
Shut up! Just shut up!

288
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:56,333
I swear! He was really cold
and he grabbed me and took my jacket!

289
00:29:56,578 --> 00:30:00,014
Well, you know, if I was cold,
I'd take your jacket too.

290
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:02,239
Shut up! You're both pathetic!

291
00:30:02,417 --> 00:30:05,511
Shut up!
Look, I am the boss in this car.

292
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:07,243
Me! I am!

293
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:10,080
And the boss says, shut up!

294
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:15,762
This isn't just the finest excuse you've
ever come up with for losing a jacket?

295
00:30:16,097 --> 00:30:20,431
It'd be a great excuse, but it's the
truth. This frozen guy was there!

296
00:30:20,602 --> 00:30:23,833
I saw him too.
And I was there and I saw him!

297
00:30:26,941 --> 00:30:29,603
I'm sure he's in there for a reason.

298
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:51,351
I...

299
00:31:53,127 --> 00:31:54,458
...would like...

300
00:31:54,963 --> 00:31:57,022
...Richmond three...

301
00:31:57,532 --> 00:31:58,692
...four...

302
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:00,459
...two...

303
00:32:00,868 --> 00:32:01,857
...please.

304
00:32:02,036 --> 00:32:03,298
Excuse me?

305
00:32:04,372 --> 00:32:07,637
Richmond three, four, two.

306
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:10,141
74342?

307
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:13,138
Please. I'd like...

308
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:14,880
...to speak...

309
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:18,217
...to Harry Finley.

310
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:21,546
Harry Finley, please.

311
00:32:22,056 --> 00:32:26,550
Sir, you're missing 2 digits.
You need 7 digits, you only gave me 5.

312
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:57,247
Oh, brother!

313
00:33:17,945 --> 00:33:20,243
There's no one here by that name.

314
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,010
Then I need to talk
to someone else in charge.

315
00:33:26,287 --> 00:33:30,223
Sir, I'm sorry,
but I can't let you in here. No way.

316
00:33:30,458 --> 00:33:33,791
I know how I must look to you, okay?

317
00:33:34,128 --> 00:33:38,792
Believe me, I wouldn't let me in here
either, if I was you. But you must...

318
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:41,661
I must ask you to leave the premises.

319
00:33:43,304 --> 00:33:46,296
My name is Captain Daniel McCormick.

320
00:33:47,141 --> 00:33:51,635
Serial number 241988539.

321
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:53,977
I know your name too.

322
00:33:54,148 --> 00:33:56,582
Now, you look like a nice kid...

323
00:33:56,818 --> 00:34:01,414
...but if you don't get your supervisor
out here now to talk to me...

324
00:34:01,756 --> 00:34:06,591
...I will make sure you pull guard duty
for the rest of your military career!

325
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:09,594
Have you got that? Have you got that?

326
00:34:18,206 --> 00:34:22,370
And you say it was registered
as Project B, which stands for Buford?

327
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,871
Yes, that was the name of the...

328
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,878
...chicken.

329
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:28,709
That Finley first tested?

330
00:34:28,883 --> 00:34:30,214
That's correct.

331
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:34,382
You woke up yesterday in the warehouse
that we're tearing down?

332
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,382
I know it sounds crazy, but...

333
00:34:37,558 --> 00:34:38,650
A little.

334
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,892
Who was your supervising officer?

335
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:47,162
Boyle. Major David E. Boyle.

336
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:55,339
I went where Harry used to live and now
there's a place called Ralph's there.

337
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,238
I see.

338
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,573
We don't keep records
that far back...

339
00:35:01,749 --> 00:35:04,912
...but our scientists
would be fascinated.

340
00:35:07,421 --> 00:35:10,822
- This is classified information?
- Right. Harry told no one.

341
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,585
Not even his employees knew.

342
00:35:14,095 --> 00:35:17,587
Just Harry and I.
And I told one other person, but...

343
00:35:17,765 --> 00:35:18,754
Who?

344
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:20,264
She's dead.

345
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:24,704
I'll call security.

346
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:25,861
Swell!

347
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:27,870
Can I have a cigarette?

348
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,773
Me.

349
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,611
I got something here
I think you should do something about.

350
00:35:41,122 --> 00:35:43,682
I think you should probably meet.

351
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:47,621
He says he was in a metal capsule
in our warehouse for many years.

352
00:35:47,795 --> 00:35:50,457
Come over with your men. Pronto.

353
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,222
Because I think it's going to be...

354
00:35:53,801 --> 00:35:54,961
...maybe a...

355
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,060
It's going to be...

356
00:35:57,471 --> 00:35:59,962
Sam? Hold on one sec.

357
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,481
Cancel it, Sam.

358
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:11,584
I'm not lying!

359
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:14,079
You're lying.

360
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:18,089
I swear. He said he'd never seen
so many cavities in one mouth.

361
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,820
He wants to send a sample of my saliva
to the University of Wisconsin.

362
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:23,486
Your saliva.

363
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:26,997
Give it to me.

364
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:34,505
Nat Cooper?

365
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,602
It's the dead guy!

366
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,010
The dead guy!

367
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:58,123
Give me that! Give me that bat!

368
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:00,625
I won't kill you.

369
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,964
I'm not going to kill you, okay?
I won't kill you.

370
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,707
I just want to know
how I got this jacket.

371
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,883
All right.

372
00:37:23,224 --> 00:37:24,384
All right!

373
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:30,888
We went to the warehouse
with Felix's brother, Steven.

374
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,497
And we were playing in there.

375
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:37,329
And we saw a metal thing
and thought it was a submarine.

376
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,330
And we opened it up somehow
and you were inside.

377
00:37:41,575 --> 00:37:42,701
Right?

378
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,180
There were no guards?

379
00:37:51,419 --> 00:37:52,579
No doctors?

380
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:54,912
No, sir.

381
00:37:55,756 --> 00:37:57,018
Just junk.

382
00:37:57,925 --> 00:37:59,017
Junk.

383
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:03,261
Hello, I was looking for a gentleman
named Harry Finley.

384
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,530
He used to live in this area.

385
00:38:06,934 --> 00:38:10,097
I thought you might be related to him.

386
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:15,765
Thanks anyway, ma'am. Thanks.
Good-bye.

387
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:25,716
Do you fellas do this a lot? Mess with
classified military experiments?

388
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:28,377
No, sir. This is the first time.

389
00:38:28,956 --> 00:38:31,618
My name's Nat. This is Felix.

390
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,592
What's yours?

391
00:38:35,629 --> 00:38:38,894
You want me to steal you some clothes
from dad's closet?

392
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:40,464
Hello, sir.

393
00:38:42,636 --> 00:38:44,297
Excuse me.

394
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:50,303
He said, "Leave a message,"
then squealed.

395
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:56,405
Hi, this is Nat. I'm looking for a guy
named Harry Finley.

396
00:38:56,584 --> 00:39:00,577
If you know where to find him,
please call me at 555-2368.

397
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:01,810
Thank you.

398
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,249
Answering machine.

399
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:04,583
Machine?

400
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:09,654
I'm talking to a machine. What the heck
happened in the last 50 years?

401
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,491
I use this for my history.
I got a B minus.

402
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:14,929
It goes fast...

403
00:39:15,669 --> 00:39:19,833
...like this, or go slow.
Zoom in. Look at that.

404
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,301
Hold it!

405
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,848
What do you do, anyway? Like for a job?

406
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,951
What's your job?

407
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,782
I'm a test pilot.

408
00:39:43,197 --> 00:39:45,688
- He's a pilot!
- We found a pilot!

409
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,700
I'm in the library on a Saturday.
She'll think I'm a geek.

410
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:58,310
She's in here too.

411
00:39:59,046 --> 00:40:00,377
Oh, yeah.

412
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,708
Look, just go talk to her.

413
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,383
Just do it.

414
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:12,783
Hey, Alice...

415
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,984
...nice dress.

416
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,891
Thanks.

417
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:19,031
Looks like wallpaper.

418
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:21,223
Good wallpaper.

419
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:23,726
No problem.

420
00:40:24,405 --> 00:40:25,838
Bitchin' nail polish.

421
00:40:26,073 --> 00:40:27,438
Looks like blood.

422
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,407
How's your summer going?

423
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,513
Fine, so far.

424
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:42,688
I'm just here doing some reading.
"Little Women."

425
00:40:43,257 --> 00:40:44,519
It's good!

426
00:40:46,427 --> 00:40:48,361
I had a huge bike accident.

427
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:49,585
Really?

428
00:40:49,763 --> 00:40:53,096
Thrashed my bike. Thrashed.
Totally thrashed.

429
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,525
I got a big cut too.

430
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,361
Going to be a big scab.

431
00:40:58,939 --> 00:40:59,963
But I won't pick.

432
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:02,204
That's cool.

433
00:41:03,277 --> 00:41:04,437
Thanks.

434
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,275
Well... I have to go.

435
00:41:07,948 --> 00:41:08,744
See you.

436
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,276
Cool.

437
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,449
I'm a geek.

438
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:23,862
You must write the National Personnel
Center, they deal with military records.

439
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,726
They got a form. Takes like six weeks.

440
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,462
6 weeks is too long.

441
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,907
This is urgent.
I need to find this man today.

442
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,740
It's a matter of life and death for me.

443
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,641
Please.

444
00:41:49,957 --> 00:41:51,584
What did... Who? Harry who?

445
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,659
Finley. Harry Finley.

446
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:55,920
1939?

447
00:41:57,164 --> 00:41:59,155
That'd make him pretty old.

448
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:01,828
Yeah, I guess it would.

449
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,431
All right.

450
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:09,269
I have a friend. He works
at a locator service in San Antonio.

451
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,940
Let me see what he can do.
It might take a few days.

452
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:14,674
It's okay.

453
00:42:16,016 --> 00:42:19,952
If you call me here tomorrow after 12,
that's when I get in.

454
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,613
Ask for me, Debbie.

455
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,296
I put my home number on there too.
Just in case.

456
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:41,872
You can stay here more than one night
if you need to.

457
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,710
Peanut butter, jelly and banana.

458
00:42:44,878 --> 00:42:46,072
Perfect.

459
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,213
- Told you.
- Good.

460
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,812
Drink?

461
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,319
Dessert.

462
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:01,389
And this is to catch up some more
in history. I got it for my birthday.

463
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,820
You'll break it open. Don't do that.

464
00:43:05,065 --> 00:43:07,226
See, pull it off like that.

465
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:10,662
You put the straw in that hole there.

466
00:43:11,405 --> 00:43:12,201
Drink box.

467
00:43:12,573 --> 00:43:13,665
Thanks.

468
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,339
No sweat.

469
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,737
Guys?

470
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,843
Mrs. Watson's here.

471
00:43:25,586 --> 00:43:26,382
My mom.

472
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:27,983
I figured.

473
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,183
You like my tree house?

474
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:33,059
Swell.

475
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,491
Cool! See you.

476
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:22,631
Stop it, Fred!

477
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,234
Stop it! Stop it!

478
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,212
I want to talk!

479
00:44:36,657 --> 00:44:37,715
Say, fella!

480
00:44:39,326 --> 00:44:40,418
All right!

481
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,152
Take a walk and cool off.

482
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:44,153
All right? Go on.

483
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,179
Come on.

484
00:45:50,931 --> 00:45:53,627
I was walking past
and I heard you scream.

485
00:45:57,905 --> 00:45:59,065
You okay?

486
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,737
Here, you're shaking like a leaf.
Sit down.

487
00:46:07,247 --> 00:46:08,578
So am I.

488
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:09,909
You okay?

489
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:12,507
Good.

490
00:46:16,924 --> 00:46:18,255
This is yours?

491
00:46:18,425 --> 00:46:22,020
It must have been his,
but I'm sure he'd want you to have it.

492
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,520
You're bleeding.

493
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,256
Oh, that's nothing.

494
00:46:26,433 --> 00:46:28,025
Let me clean it up.

495
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:29,692
That's just a scratch.

496
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:33,203
That's not a scratch, it's a gash.
I'm a nurse.

497
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,931
I know a gash when I see one.
Sit down.

498
00:46:43,617 --> 00:46:46,211
I think you may have just saved my life.

499
00:46:48,455 --> 00:46:49,547
Maybe.

500
00:46:50,491 --> 00:46:51,287
Prick!

501
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:55,050
I've known assholes in my time,
but this guy...

502
00:46:55,462 --> 00:46:57,623
...this guy could give lessons.

503
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,623
This will sting.

504
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,233
You see...

505
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,402
...Fred is a drunk.

506
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:10,339
Which is the least of his problems.
He's got no spine and no decency.

507
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:14,077
He's a punk and I knew it
the day I met him.

508
00:47:17,985 --> 00:47:19,475
I know what you're thinking.

509
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,085
I haven't dated him...

510
00:47:22,656 --> 00:47:24,817
...in two years. Over that.

511
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,155
Every once in a while he comes back...

512
00:47:28,495 --> 00:47:31,123
...like those storms in Japan, you
know...

513
00:47:31,331 --> 00:47:34,823
...those violent ones
that destroy all the villages?

514
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,092
Well, that's Fred.

515
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:41,930
Did you tell me your name?

516
00:47:43,677 --> 00:47:45,838
I knew a Danny once.

517
00:47:46,013 --> 00:47:47,503
Worse than Fred.

518
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,446
Well, maybe not.

519
00:47:56,623 --> 00:47:58,113
What do you do...

520
00:47:59,192 --> 00:48:03,561
...besides patrolling neighborhoods
looking for signs of domestic problems?

521
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,462
I'm an Air Corps test pilot.

522
00:48:08,702 --> 00:48:11,034
And in your off-time...

523
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,467
...you save lives?

524
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,802
That's it.

525
00:48:22,382 --> 00:48:23,974
My name's Claire.

526
00:48:24,217 --> 00:48:26,014
In case you were curious.

527
00:48:28,221 --> 00:48:31,713
"A scout never shirks
or grumbles at hardship."

528
00:48:33,527 --> 00:48:35,518
What the hell is "shirks?"

529
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,664
Hey, guys.

530
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,500
I'd like you to meet someone.

531
00:48:48,241 --> 00:48:50,334
This is my son, Nat, and Felix.

532
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,334
This is Daniel.

533
00:48:54,581 --> 00:48:55,912
You guys okay?

534
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:57,072
Fine.

535
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,046
Daniel's a pilot.

536
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,451
- Cool!
- You're kidding!

537
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,751
You found your jacket.

538
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,920
Still think you saw a frozen guy?

539
00:49:14,101 --> 00:49:15,261
Excuse me.

540
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,430
What are you doing here?

541
00:49:20,607 --> 00:49:24,976
A jerk showed up. I helped your mom get
rid of him. Don't worry, I'm leaving.

542
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,609
Wait, the couch is totally comfy.

543
00:49:27,781 --> 00:49:30,773
Or my room. The ceiling's
a glow-in-the dark universe.

544
00:49:31,118 --> 00:49:34,315
You mother won't let a stranger
stay in the house.

545
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,813
Want to bet?

546
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:40,557
The toothpaste is in the mirror
and there's a new toothbrush there.

547
00:49:40,794 --> 00:49:43,388
Nat, would you get him a pillow, please?

548
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,552
Cool.

549
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:48,963
For hot water, turn the faucet to
4 o'clock and then when it gets warm...

550
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:52,967
...turn it to 9 and then back to 11.
Sort of like a safe.

551
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,904
It's awfully kind of you
to let me stay here.

552
00:49:56,576 --> 00:50:00,410
I figure if you wanted to kill me,
you would have let Fred do it.

553
00:50:02,315 --> 00:50:04,146
And you have an honest smile.

554
00:50:06,486 --> 00:50:09,978
Some are born with great legs,
but the rest of us work at it.

555
00:50:10,157 --> 00:50:13,820
I used to do aerobics till I dropped,
then I found Thighmaster.

556
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,652
Great legs.

557
00:50:16,163 --> 00:50:19,155
Every single time
you squeeze the Thighmaster...

558
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,424
...you strengthen and tone.

559
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:26,163
So it's easy to squeeze your way
to shapely hips and thighs.

560
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:31,007
It's called television.

561
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:34,841
I saw it at the 1939 World's Fair.

562
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,180
'Night.

563
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:46,085
Thank you, Thighmaster.

564
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:54,633
Get up. That guy called back.

565
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:58,134
He said he knows a Harry Finley.
Lives about an hour from here.

566
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,973
What time is it?

567
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:08,136
7:30

568
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,044
- I got to go.
- Wait!

569
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,251
We're going to the Wings of Freedom.

570
00:51:12,552 --> 00:51:15,214
The air show. It's near your friend.

571
00:51:15,388 --> 00:51:16,480
Morning.

572
00:51:17,891 --> 00:51:19,222
How was it?

573
00:51:19,392 --> 00:51:21,917
You're one of the kindest people
I've ever met.

574
00:51:22,763 --> 00:51:24,025
You haven't seen my temper.

575
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,891
Yeah, you haven't seen that.

576
00:51:28,268 --> 00:51:29,064
Breakfast?

577
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:32,666
I must meet an old friend.
Thanks, but I got to run.

578
00:51:32,906 --> 00:51:35,431
You sure? I'm a hell of a defroster.

579
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,842
No. I'm late as it is.

580
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,741
Come to the air show.

581
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,479
He said he had to go.

582
00:51:46,419 --> 00:51:48,683
Good-bye and thanks again.

583
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,188
And good luck.

584
00:51:52,425 --> 00:51:53,517
You too.

585
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:00,966
I guess that's that.

586
00:52:17,284 --> 00:52:18,546
Thanks a lot.

587
00:52:21,288 --> 00:52:22,550
Thanks again.

588
00:52:28,128 --> 00:52:29,459
May I help you?

589
00:52:33,133 --> 00:52:34,395
That's right.

590
00:52:36,136 --> 00:52:39,071
Yes. I'm sorry, sir.
You're not the...

591
00:52:42,642 --> 00:52:44,075
Are you okay?

592
00:53:07,901 --> 00:53:10,131
You got a ticket?

593
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:13,334
You must buy a ticket over there. $12.

594
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:41,698
Can we look inside?

595
00:53:41,935 --> 00:53:43,266
Sure, go ahead.

596
00:53:59,052 --> 00:54:02,385
Hi, Debbie.
This is Daniel, from yesterday.

597
00:54:03,123 --> 00:54:05,717
I was hoping you heard something.

598
00:54:07,961 --> 00:54:10,054
Couldn't you rush it?

599
00:54:11,398 --> 00:54:12,626
It's just that...

600
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:19,731
Sure, I'll try again later.

601
00:54:34,754 --> 00:54:36,483
Quit following me, okay?

602
00:54:36,656 --> 00:54:37,645
Hi, Claire.

603
00:54:38,825 --> 00:54:40,224
Find anyone to rescue?

604
00:54:44,264 --> 00:54:45,322
You know...

605
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:47,432
...I'm told...

606
00:54:48,435 --> 00:54:50,494
...that I listen exceptionally well.

607
00:54:51,171 --> 00:54:53,230
If you want to talk.

608
00:54:54,774 --> 00:54:56,332
You ever feel lost?

609
00:54:56,509 --> 00:54:57,840
I invented it.

610
00:54:58,178 --> 00:54:59,110
It's mine.

611
00:55:00,447 --> 00:55:03,848
My buddy was supposed to be here
when I woke up.

612
00:55:04,684 --> 00:55:06,618
He used to live here...

613
00:55:06,953 --> 00:55:10,787
...and I can't find him.
I know that sounds desperate, but...

614
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:13,022
...he's all I have left.

615
00:55:14,027 --> 00:55:15,517
You could always go home.

616
00:55:17,197 --> 00:55:20,030
I lost someone close to me,
that's why I left.

617
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,694
That's why I haven't got any money
or clothes or home. I just left and...

618
00:55:27,207 --> 00:55:29,869
I didn't think about where I'd end up.

619
00:55:32,178 --> 00:55:33,145
Everything okay?

620
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:41,810
I'm sorry. Daniel, this is John.
John, this is Daniel.

621
00:55:42,389 --> 00:55:43,822
Pleased to meet you.

622
00:55:45,158 --> 00:55:49,322
Daniel is going to be staying with us
for a couple days.

623
00:55:49,562 --> 00:55:50,995
Till he finds his friend.

624
00:55:53,566 --> 00:55:56,057
It's good to know you. Daniel.

625
00:55:58,905 --> 00:56:00,566
Hi, this is Debbie.

626
00:56:01,408 --> 00:56:03,899
Leave a message, I'll call you back.

627
00:56:05,845 --> 00:56:08,245
Hi, Debbie. This is Daniel McCormick.

628
00:56:08,515 --> 00:56:11,575
I'm staying at 555-2368.

629
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,684
I'd really appreciate it,
if you hear anything...

630
00:56:16,923 --> 00:56:18,584
...call me here.

631
00:56:18,758 --> 00:56:20,521
Thanks again for everything.

632
00:56:35,108 --> 00:56:36,097
Making dinner?

633
00:56:36,376 --> 00:56:38,037
I got to do something.

634
00:56:43,783 --> 00:56:46,547
Maybe tomorrow,
if you don't find your friend...

635
00:56:46,786 --> 00:56:48,151
...you can teach me to fly.

636
00:56:49,122 --> 00:56:50,555
That might be tough.

637
00:56:50,723 --> 00:56:51,712
Why?

638
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,721
To begin with...

639
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:56,790
...I don't have a flight jacket.

640
00:56:57,797 --> 00:56:59,059
And secondly...

641
00:57:00,233 --> 00:57:01,495
...I have no plane.

642
00:57:10,743 --> 00:57:12,836
My father left when I was one.

643
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,743
Thought you'd want to know.

644
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:19,574
I don't think that's any of my business.

645
00:57:21,754 --> 00:57:24,314
He hasn't talked to us since.

646
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,252
Thanks.

647
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,433
Can I help out?

648
00:57:41,441 --> 00:57:42,999
Chop up this onion.

649
00:57:48,681 --> 00:57:50,114
Not the fingers, okay?

650
00:57:50,283 --> 00:57:52,183
I know, don't worry.

651
00:58:32,892 --> 00:58:34,382
Anyway, this guy...

652
00:58:34,727 --> 00:58:36,888
...is covered in blood. Covered!

653
00:58:37,063 --> 00:58:38,655
His heart is stopped.

654
00:58:39,065 --> 00:58:42,057
They must open him up.
No time for procedure.

655
00:58:42,235 --> 00:58:45,068
So they open him up
and I had to massage his heart.

656
00:58:45,238 --> 00:58:48,833
I actually held his heart
and pumped it for him, right?

657
00:58:49,075 --> 00:58:52,909
And there's a horrible accident
on the 5, with other injuries.

658
00:58:53,246 --> 00:58:56,238
This guy, whose heart I'm pumping...

659
00:58:57,250 --> 00:58:58,740
...his eyes open...

660
00:58:59,752 --> 00:59:03,745
...and he looks at me
and looks at his heart and says:

661
00:59:04,424 --> 00:59:05,948
"You're holding my heart."

662
00:59:08,595 --> 00:59:09,755
What'd you say?

663
00:59:10,597 --> 00:59:12,087
"Yes, I am."

664
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:15,761
The anesthesiologist almost fainted.

665
00:59:15,935 --> 00:59:17,266
Anyway...

666
00:59:17,537 --> 00:59:20,802
...that was a while ago.
Today, when I got to work...

667
00:59:21,374 --> 00:59:26,038
...he sent me chocolates in a heart-
shaped box. Isn't that a good story?

668
00:59:26,613 --> 00:59:27,511
Great.

669
00:59:29,215 --> 00:59:30,273
This is great.

670
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,610
Come on!

671
00:59:31,884 --> 00:59:33,442
The scary thing is...

672
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,214
...that all of this was
in my cupboard, lurking.

673
00:59:37,557 --> 00:59:41,459
And thank you very much
for taking the boys to that...

674
00:59:45,798 --> 00:59:47,288
We have a date!

675
00:59:48,067 --> 00:59:49,227
Tonight!

676
00:59:49,736 --> 00:59:51,067
Am I early?

677
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,573
I was trying out Daniel's cooking.
It's good.

678
00:59:56,743 --> 00:59:58,677
Thanks. Want some?

679
00:59:58,911 --> 00:59:59,741
Good.

680
01:00:01,414 --> 01:00:02,904
I'll just be a sec.

681
01:00:12,258 --> 01:00:13,316
Hi, guys.

682
01:00:28,441 --> 01:00:29,772
You're a doctor?

683
01:00:32,345 --> 01:00:33,437
That's right.

684
01:00:35,014 --> 01:00:36,606
I understand you're a pilot?

685
01:00:37,684 --> 01:00:38,844
That's right.

686
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:40,378
Doctor, pilot.

687
01:00:42,955 --> 01:00:44,115
Shit!

688
01:00:46,793 --> 01:00:47,851
Are you okay?

689
01:00:50,463 --> 01:00:55,196
I've got a waterfall in my closet.
Nat, get the spaghetti pot.

690
01:00:56,135 --> 01:00:57,966
Heck, that's unbelievable.

691
01:00:58,204 --> 01:01:00,365
It's just a hole in the roof.

692
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:01,871
Just?!

693
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:04,199
We could do this another night.

694
01:01:04,377 --> 01:01:07,369
- Have you got hammers, nails, shingles?
- I have a hammer.

695
01:01:07,547 --> 01:01:09,310
Can I do anything?

696
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:13,710
I can go to the hardware store tomorrow
if it's still there...

697
01:01:13,886 --> 01:01:15,547
...fix this in a jiffy.

698
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:19,323
Go to dinner, you two. Get out of here.

699
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,559
Go on. You'll be late.

700
01:01:22,729 --> 01:01:23,718
Wait!

701
01:01:24,497 --> 01:01:26,226
The roof will be on Fred.

702
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,728
Nine o'clock.

703
01:01:29,068 --> 01:01:31,161
Thank you. I'm starving!

704
01:01:31,337 --> 01:01:32,395
Have fun!

705
01:01:32,839 --> 01:01:36,673
We're not talking about tanks.
Did you call Potcasky?

706
01:01:36,843 --> 01:01:39,903
- How did you explain yourself?
- It was bad judgment.

707
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,172
If there's a media circus...

708
01:01:42,348 --> 01:01:46,011
I understand sir.
I'm sure it will not come to that.

709
01:01:46,686 --> 01:01:48,847
I am right on top of it, sir.

710
01:01:49,021 --> 01:01:50,420
You better be.

711
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:41,570
Can I help you?

712
01:02:45,478 --> 01:02:48,413
I'd like to sit here for a moment
if that's okay.

713
01:04:10,897 --> 01:04:12,558
Can I ask you something?

714
01:04:13,332 --> 01:04:14,390
Shoot.

715
01:04:14,834 --> 01:04:17,394
- Remember that girl in the library?
- What?

716
01:04:17,837 --> 01:04:20,499
That girl in the library. Alice?

717
01:04:23,576 --> 01:04:25,237
She's really cool.

718
01:04:31,183 --> 01:04:32,844
Plus she's really pretty.

719
01:04:37,256 --> 01:04:38,780
What is your question?

720
01:04:41,928 --> 01:04:46,627
...Felix says I should make her jealous,
like his brother does with girls.

721
01:04:47,433 --> 01:04:49,924
Aren't you a little young to be...

722
01:04:51,037 --> 01:04:52,868
Think about other stuff.

723
01:04:53,205 --> 01:04:54,536
I'm ten!

724
01:04:56,709 --> 01:04:58,108
I really like her.

725
01:05:02,882 --> 01:05:04,372
If I were you...

726
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:09,619
...I'd forget about her.

727
01:05:09,956 --> 01:05:11,446
Just forget about her.

728
01:05:11,891 --> 01:05:12,880
Trust me.

729
01:05:23,135 --> 01:05:24,397
You okay?

730
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:39,182
Thanks for risking your life
to save my underwear.

731
01:05:39,485 --> 01:05:42,477
I just lost my balance up there today,
is all.

732
01:05:42,822 --> 01:05:46,485
You sure you don't want to talk to John?
He's a good doctor.

733
01:05:46,759 --> 01:05:48,488
He seems like a nice guy.

734
01:05:49,662 --> 01:05:52,597
He is a nice guy. Nicest guy I know.

735
01:05:55,334 --> 01:05:57,768
This one's great. You like her?

736
01:05:57,937 --> 01:06:00,337
Who doesn't like Billie Holiday?

737
01:06:02,608 --> 01:06:04,508
You don't have to put that on.

738
01:06:05,344 --> 01:06:06,777
Nat's asleep.

739
01:06:07,613 --> 01:06:11,515
The girls at work just gave me
this CD player for my birthday.

740
01:06:13,352 --> 01:06:17,118
I just think
the old records sound better somehow.

741
01:06:20,626 --> 01:06:24,619
I know there's an EQ thingy, but I can
never figure out which button.

742
01:06:31,804 --> 01:06:33,635
She's incredible, isn't she?

743
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:41,265
I know what it feels like.

744
01:08:23,916 --> 01:08:25,747
I'm sorry.

745
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:32,150
I know.

746
01:08:35,995 --> 01:08:37,758
I'm going to work.

747
01:09:05,357 --> 01:09:07,518
Nat, wake up!

748
01:09:08,694 --> 01:09:09,683
What?

749
01:09:09,862 --> 01:09:11,124
I was wrong.

750
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:16,131
Before, about Alice.
I told you to forget about it.

751
01:09:17,136 --> 01:09:18,535
What about her?

752
01:09:18,704 --> 01:09:22,196
You know how you want
to know what you should do?

753
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,574
You must tell her.

754
01:09:26,312 --> 01:09:27,472
What?

755
01:09:27,713 --> 01:09:30,648
The next time you see her,
the very next time...

756
01:09:30,816 --> 01:09:35,378
...when your heart pounds and you're
nervous and... You know what I mean?

757
01:09:37,323 --> 01:09:38,790
Just let go.

758
01:09:40,893 --> 01:09:42,224
What do you mean?

759
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:47,396
Let go. Tell her everything. Tell her
how you feel. It's hard, but you must!

760
01:09:47,566 --> 01:09:48,692
How?

761
01:09:49,501 --> 01:09:52,231
You know that stuff you told me?

762
01:09:52,404 --> 01:09:54,235
Tell that stuff to her.

763
01:09:54,673 --> 01:09:56,903
Open your heart. Sing to her!

764
01:09:57,076 --> 01:09:58,236
Sing?

765
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:00,239
Tell her everything.

766
01:10:00,412 --> 01:10:02,676
Sing to her. The sooner the better.

767
01:10:03,015 --> 01:10:04,346
Because...

768
01:10:04,516 --> 01:10:06,575
...you might not get another chance.

769
01:10:08,854 --> 01:10:09,912
Follow?

770
01:10:14,593 --> 01:10:15,582
Good.

771
01:10:16,528 --> 01:10:18,428
Good. It's late.

772
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:22,758
Good. Go to sleep.

773
01:10:22,935 --> 01:10:27,599
I just wanted to tell you I was wrong.
I thought that you should know.

774
01:10:30,276 --> 01:10:31,436
Thanks.

775
01:10:32,611 --> 01:10:33,600
Good night.

776
01:11:08,047 --> 01:11:09,036
It's me.

777
01:11:10,049 --> 01:11:11,380
Why are you here?

778
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:39,741
Is this a prank?

779
01:11:45,417 --> 01:11:48,079
No, sir, this is very serious.

780
01:11:49,254 --> 01:11:53,190
Sorry to disturb you. I'm Nat Cooper.
I'm in love with your daughter.

781
01:11:54,093 --> 01:11:58,427
I see her in class every day
and I just really like her a lot.

782
01:11:59,098 --> 01:12:00,588
And that's the truth.

783
01:12:03,268 --> 01:12:04,360
Go home.

784
01:12:04,536 --> 01:12:06,197
- But, sir!
- Good night.

785
01:12:53,318 --> 01:12:54,910
This is Cameron.

786
01:12:58,991 --> 01:13:00,481
They found what?!

787
01:13:17,276 --> 01:13:18,334
You're leaving?

788
01:13:23,682 --> 01:13:24,944
For you.

789
01:13:46,538 --> 01:13:48,802
Falcon Control, magnetos on.

790
01:13:49,808 --> 01:13:51,537
Now prime the engines...

791
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:54,543
...for a few seconds,
so fuel gets to the engines.

792
01:13:54,813 --> 01:13:56,474
Set your brakes.

793
01:13:56,882 --> 01:13:57,871
Right!

794
01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:01,816
No, don't say, "right,"
say, "check." "Right" gets confusing.

795
01:14:02,054 --> 01:14:03,715
- Check!
- Right.

796
01:14:05,824 --> 01:14:09,555
Starter engine on.
Okay, oil pressure's coming up.

797
01:14:10,229 --> 01:14:13,164
Mixture's still rich.
Give it a little throttle.

798
01:14:14,333 --> 01:14:16,494
We're rolling. Check flight controls.

799
01:14:17,169 --> 01:14:19,569
Make sure they're free and correct.

800
01:14:19,738 --> 01:14:20,727
Good.

801
01:14:20,906 --> 01:14:22,999
Set flaps for takeoff.

802
01:14:23,175 --> 01:14:24,574
Just a quarter.

803
01:14:24,776 --> 01:14:25,708
Ready?

804
01:14:27,379 --> 01:14:28,368
Throttle on.

805
01:14:29,081 --> 01:14:30,673
All the way.

806
01:14:30,849 --> 01:14:34,182
Now we're moving. Back pressure.
More back pressure.

807
01:14:34,353 --> 01:14:37,015
- Increasing.
- Yes. Okay, we're climbing.

808
01:14:37,189 --> 01:14:38,349
We're up!

809
01:14:40,359 --> 01:14:42,020
Lift gear. Gear up.

810
01:14:43,428 --> 01:14:44,417
Flaps up.

811
01:14:45,197 --> 01:14:46,755
Okay, we're flying.

812
01:14:47,533 --> 01:14:49,091
Come back to the middle.

813
01:14:57,943 --> 01:15:00,434
- Where's the airport?
- Over there.

814
01:15:00,612 --> 01:15:02,102
Let's go back there.

815
01:15:02,614 --> 01:15:05,048
Smooth now. Smooth.

816
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:07,384
We lost the right engine!

817
01:15:07,553 --> 01:15:08,451
What now?

818
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,281
Feather props, cut mixture.

819
01:15:10,556 --> 01:15:14,549
Get ready to lean on the rudder.
We must find a place to land.

820
01:15:14,726 --> 01:15:16,057
There! A field.

821
01:15:16,295 --> 01:15:19,731
A field, okay. Looks okay to me.
Stay calm now.

822
01:15:19,898 --> 01:15:23,459
Maintain optimum glide speed.
Slowly pull your power back.

823
01:15:23,635 --> 01:15:26,798
And get in a notch of these flaps.
Just a notch!

824
01:15:27,139 --> 01:15:28,731
Okay. Will we make it?

825
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:29,999
Gear down.

826
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,642
Gear down. Check.

827
01:15:31,810 --> 01:15:34,404
Airspeed, 135 miles per hour.

828
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:35,808
Full flaps.

829
01:15:35,981 --> 01:15:37,642
Watch the horizon.

830
01:15:37,816 --> 01:15:40,910
Pull back. Not too much!
You'll flare up.

831
01:15:41,253 --> 01:15:43,414
Just watch the horizon.

832
01:15:47,492 --> 01:15:49,323
Watch out for the tree!

833
01:15:49,494 --> 01:15:52,088
And the cows. And the potholes!

834
01:15:52,197 --> 01:15:53,687
Step on the brakes.

835
01:15:54,166 --> 01:15:56,828
Slowly! Too much! Slowly.

836
01:16:00,072 --> 01:16:02,165
If you can land a B-25...

837
01:16:02,841 --> 01:16:04,433
...you can do anything.

838
01:16:05,177 --> 01:16:06,439
Thanks a lot.

839
01:16:06,612 --> 01:16:09,103
No, thank you for the jacket.

840
01:16:09,948 --> 01:16:11,279
You're welcome.

841
01:16:13,785 --> 01:16:16,015
This tree house gets your back.

842
01:16:16,955 --> 01:16:19,014
Sure you won't stay?

843
01:16:25,697 --> 01:16:27,130
What's happening?!

844
01:16:35,807 --> 01:16:36,796
Help!

845
01:16:54,893 --> 01:16:58,056
- Blood pressure?
- 90 over 60. Pulse is 112.

846
01:16:58,997 --> 01:16:59,861
What is it?

847
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:01,226
I don't know.

848
01:17:04,736 --> 01:17:05,896
Oh, God!

849
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:14,242
I'm not making this up.

850
01:17:20,252 --> 01:17:23,346
- McCormick in Emergency...
- McCormick? It's the FBI.

851
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:24,749
This guy's in trouble.

852
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:30,093
I'm confused. Look at those indices.
What kind of blood activity is that?

853
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:41,432
Dr. Cameron, Lieutenant Colonel Wilcox.

854
01:17:41,707 --> 01:17:42,867
How are you?

855
01:17:43,208 --> 01:17:44,539
You okay?

856
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:47,201
Yes, I'm just not the best flier.

857
01:17:49,047 --> 01:17:51,538
I hear you have some good news.

858
01:17:51,717 --> 01:17:53,878
Yes, sir. Some very good news.

859
01:18:13,238 --> 01:18:14,967
Quit following me!

860
01:18:18,143 --> 01:18:20,577
Oh, brother!

861
01:18:23,415 --> 01:18:25,406
I'm still here, huh?

862
01:18:26,418 --> 01:18:27,817
You...

863
01:18:28,153 --> 01:18:29,313
...look...

864
01:18:30,088 --> 01:18:31,248
...terrible.

865
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:34,586
Yeah, but not bad for a guy my age,
right?

866
01:18:38,597 --> 01:18:39,928
It's not possible.

867
01:18:40,098 --> 01:18:43,090
Claire, I was born in 1907.

868
01:18:43,268 --> 01:18:44,257
I know.

869
01:18:44,436 --> 01:18:46,996
I felt the same
when Harry told me the idea.

870
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:48,428
Harry Finley?

871
01:18:48,607 --> 01:18:49,665
You know him?

872
01:18:49,841 --> 01:18:53,333
A woman left a message.
I thought it was a wrong number.

873
01:18:54,446 --> 01:18:56,437
It's still on the machine.

874
01:18:56,615 --> 01:18:59,675
Maybe he was exposed
to some form of radiation.

875
01:18:59,851 --> 01:19:03,184
He's got what looks like
a form of progeria.

876
01:19:03,355 --> 01:19:05,846
I've never seen this. He is aging!

877
01:19:06,024 --> 01:19:07,616
- Will he live?
- I don't know.

878
01:19:07,793 --> 01:19:11,024
- We must get him out.
- The FBI is coming!

879
01:19:11,196 --> 01:19:12,458
I know!

880
01:19:14,366 --> 01:19:16,527
- What?
- Stall them. Please?

881
01:19:17,702 --> 01:19:19,363
John, trust me.

882
01:19:24,876 --> 01:19:25,865
All right.

883
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:36,312
Jump in.

884
01:19:43,895 --> 01:19:45,886
- Who are those guys?
- FBI.

885
01:19:46,064 --> 01:19:48,828
- I can walk.
- Just shut up and look sick.

886
01:19:57,843 --> 01:20:01,074
- There's something you should know.
- We're in a hurry.

887
01:20:01,246 --> 01:20:02,838
McCormick has been moved.

888
01:20:03,014 --> 01:20:04,003
Open the door.

889
01:20:08,687 --> 01:20:11,850
He's in the west wing.
Follow this corridor to the end.

890
01:20:12,023 --> 01:20:14,253
Room 144.

891
01:20:24,936 --> 01:20:27,370
I'm okay, Claire. I'm all right.

892
01:20:39,384 --> 01:20:41,875
What the hell is going on here?

893
01:21:05,243 --> 01:21:08,144
Hello, I'm looking for a man
named Harry Finley.

894
01:21:08,413 --> 01:21:09,812
He was a scientist.

895
01:21:09,981 --> 01:21:13,644
His wife's name was Blanche.
He was from Chicago.

896
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:16,251
Do you know him?

897
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:17,421
That's my father.

898
01:21:17,589 --> 01:21:18,920
Is he home?

899
01:21:19,424 --> 01:21:22,086
I'm sorry, but my father is dead.

900
01:21:23,929 --> 01:21:26,489
He lived here for a few months...

901
01:21:26,665 --> 01:21:29,156
...but he died before I was born.

902
01:21:31,336 --> 01:21:33,327
You must mean another man.

903
01:21:35,674 --> 01:21:37,107
I was his best friend.

904
01:21:39,945 --> 01:21:42,778
Susan Finley's address is
14 Cypress Pond Road.

905
01:21:42,948 --> 01:21:47,282
Her father first found the problem 2
months after McCormick volunteered.

906
01:21:47,519 --> 01:21:50,682
Finley died in a chemical fire
trying to save his friend.

907
01:21:50,855 --> 01:21:55,019
Operations claimed McCormick
was killed as well. No investigation.

908
01:21:55,193 --> 01:21:58,128
When the war started,
the project was forgotten.

909
01:21:59,197 --> 01:22:03,293
So you're telling me that
McCormick was misplaced for 50 years?

910
01:22:03,468 --> 01:22:06,960
It seems so. Inventory says
the capsule was a water heater.

911
01:22:08,206 --> 01:22:09,639
My God!

912
01:22:42,907 --> 01:22:44,841
Here they are.

913
01:22:46,745 --> 01:22:48,235
That's them, all right.

914
01:23:10,435 --> 01:23:12,027
Irreversible.

915
01:23:45,236 --> 01:23:47,397
Here. These might help.

916
01:23:54,813 --> 01:23:58,909
We should go back to the hospital.
I'm sure they can help.

917
01:24:06,257 --> 01:24:08,248
That's her, isn't it?

918
01:24:10,929 --> 01:24:11,918
Helen.

919
01:24:14,432 --> 01:24:15,831
Is that your child?

920
01:24:18,002 --> 01:24:19,663
We were never married.

921
01:24:24,275 --> 01:24:27,108
That's me in the picture. I was two.

922
01:24:30,115 --> 01:24:31,605
That's impossible.

923
01:24:32,283 --> 01:24:34,342
She died before you were born.

924
01:24:37,622 --> 01:24:39,351
Helen's alive.

925
01:24:43,094 --> 01:24:45,119
- That's where we grew up.
- I know.

926
01:24:45,296 --> 01:24:47,696
- When did she move there?
- 7 years ago.

927
01:24:47,899 --> 01:24:49,196
When her husband died.

928
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:53,360
She married?

929
01:24:56,641 --> 01:24:58,040
Come on!

930
01:24:58,209 --> 01:25:00,143
I can't thank you enough.

931
01:25:00,311 --> 01:25:02,040
Put the car in drive!

932
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:34,745
- Are we going as fast as we can?
- I'm trying!

933
01:25:37,849 --> 01:25:39,180
This car won't make it.

934
01:25:40,518 --> 01:25:41,780
I need a plane.

935
01:25:44,789 --> 01:25:45,778
Hold on.

936
01:25:54,065 --> 01:25:55,032
All right!

937
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,361
Holy cow! You drive like me!

938
01:26:02,707 --> 01:26:03,765
Hold on!

939
01:26:04,609 --> 01:26:07,043
- You must pay!
- Dropping off a pilot!

940
01:26:14,452 --> 01:26:15,384
Stay here.

941
01:26:35,306 --> 01:26:36,739
Good-bye.

942
01:26:43,982 --> 01:26:47,418
Remove the wheel blocks,
I'll never ask you another favor.

943
01:26:57,762 --> 01:26:59,059
You're holding my heart.

944
01:27:04,435 --> 01:27:06,767
Just get out of the way!

945
01:27:09,674 --> 01:27:12,507
Excuse me. Watch it! Excuse me!

946
01:27:58,990 --> 01:28:02,323
Look, he hasn't seen this woman
in 50 years!

947
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,551
Hasn't he been through enough?

948
01:28:04,729 --> 01:28:07,562
You'll get your plane back.
Just leave him alone!

949
01:28:07,732 --> 01:28:10,826
- We won't hurt him.
- Then why do you want him?

950
01:28:11,002 --> 01:28:12,902
A cup of coffee? A chat?

951
01:28:13,071 --> 01:28:14,732
Excuse me.

952
01:28:15,073 --> 01:28:16,665
Walk this way, please.

953
01:28:21,012 --> 01:28:23,537
Do you know how far
the next star system is?

954
01:28:23,748 --> 01:28:28,481
100 years. You can't make that trip
without this kind of technology.

955
01:28:28,686 --> 01:28:32,417
We're decades behind
where Finley got in 1939.

956
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:37,254
And Daniel is the only link
between Finley's work and my own.

957
01:28:38,029 --> 01:28:39,690
That's not true.

958
01:28:43,201 --> 01:28:46,261
Everything you ever wanted to know
about freezing someone.

959
01:28:54,779 --> 01:28:56,212
Oh, my God!

960
01:29:10,395 --> 01:29:11,555
What're you doing?

961
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:13,996
You forgot your jacket.

962
01:29:19,737 --> 01:29:20,999
Put your belt on.

963
01:29:55,106 --> 01:29:58,405
Can we at least talk to them?
On the radio?

964
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:01,077
They're not transmitting.

965
01:30:01,345 --> 01:30:03,313
We have the craft on radar.

966
01:30:03,848 --> 01:30:07,944
I'm going to see the capsule.
Call Dr. Reese and have him come here.

967
01:30:08,119 --> 01:30:11,953
I also want everything
that the hospital did on McCormick.

968
01:30:12,123 --> 01:30:13,181
And the plane?

969
01:30:13,691 --> 01:30:16,251
When it lands,
take Mrs. Cooper to her son.

970
01:30:18,229 --> 01:30:19,218
Thank you.

971
01:30:36,781 --> 01:30:38,271
There's the old house.

972
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:55,396
Gently!

973
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:56,792
Gently!

974
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,198
Increase back pressure.

975
01:31:07,378 --> 01:31:09,539
Check! Increase back pressure!

976
01:31:12,049 --> 01:31:13,209
Don't die!

977
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:16,645
Turn right.

978
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:21,386
Gear down.

979
01:31:24,829 --> 01:31:25,761
Gear down!

980
01:31:25,930 --> 01:31:29,058
Okay. Now we're going to land this
together.

981
01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:31,167
Okay! All right!

982
01:31:34,338 --> 01:31:35,828
120 miles an hour.

983
01:31:38,242 --> 01:31:39,334
Full flaps!

984
01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:42,504
Check! Full flaps!

985
01:31:46,684 --> 01:31:48,049
Watch the horizon!

986
01:31:48,252 --> 01:31:49,344
Watching!

987
01:31:55,359 --> 01:31:58,760
Watch the horizon!
Watch the horizon! Oh, crap!

988
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:10,866
Hold it!

989
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:27,947
Pull back!

990
01:32:29,894 --> 01:32:31,122
Brakes!

991
01:32:33,898 --> 01:32:34,796
Stop!

992
01:33:07,331 --> 01:33:08,593
Show-off.

993
01:33:37,628 --> 01:33:38,959
You okay?

994
01:36:37,141 --> 01:36:39,302
So are you going to marry me?

995
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:45,375
Yes.
