1
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,427
This can't be right.

2
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:41,008
Yes.

3
00:02:43,892 --> 00:02:44,721
Yes.

4
00:02:47,124 --> 00:02:47,887
Yes.

5
00:02:50,708 --> 00:02:51,439
No.

6
00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:54,894
Professor.

7
00:03:01,908 --> 00:03:02,704
Dr. Lehman.

8
00:03:05,876 --> 00:03:08,659
Dr. Lehman, these numbers,
they can't be right.

9
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:09,966
I wish they weren't.

10
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:12,524
No, look. The mass assumption...

11
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,765
It's surprisingly hefty, but correct.

12
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,623
I was gonna say too small.

13
00:03:17,108 --> 00:03:19,475
And... and the trajectory,
that means it's heading...

14
00:03:19,604 --> 00:03:20,782
Right for us.

15
00:03:21,012 --> 00:03:23,979
And she is, pardon the melodrama,
a planet killer.

16
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:25,131
But that's impossible.

17
00:03:25,716 --> 00:03:27,953
I mean, I just checked
the near earth object database

18
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:30,451
and nobody has logged
anything remotely close.

19
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:31,726
Unless something hit one,

20
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,583
something big enough to
knock her out of her orbit...

21
00:03:33,717 --> 00:03:37,230
Here, I'm pretty sure it's Kassandra.

22
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:41,137
No way.

23
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,409
I'm afraid so.

24
00:03:43,444 --> 00:03:47,121
That's 61 miles, about three times
the size of Mount Everest.

25
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:52,523
Okay, we're... we're talking
extinction event, like the dinosaurs.

26
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:53,807
What's so funny?

27
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:58,058
In Greek mythology,
the sun god Apollo cursed Kassandra

28
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,368
with the power to predict death
and destruction.

29
00:04:01,045 --> 00:04:02,092
So what do we do?

30
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:04,977
We run the asymmetrical
trajectory algorithm

31
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:07,345
to find Kassandra's approach vectors.

32
00:04:07,476 --> 00:04:09,135
Send the coordinates to JPL,

33
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,203
and pray there's enough firepower
to blast it from the sky.

34
00:04:27,124 --> 00:04:30,158
Hey, it's me, AGAIN.

35
00:04:30,869 --> 00:04:32,363
I'm heading back to school.

36
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:38,413
Um... I, uh... Grandpa says hi.

37
00:04:42,645 --> 00:04:45,100
I love you.
Call me when you can.

38
00:04:46,805 --> 00:04:47,372
There.

39
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:51,760
Jenny, I know there's tension
between you and your dad.

40
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:54,479
You've had words, but believe me,
they are just words.

41
00:04:54,613 --> 00:04:56,369
He loves you very much.

42
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:58,802
Right, well, you know,
if he ever finds the time,

43
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,210
he can tell me that himself.

44
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:15,315
Grandpa says hi.

45
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:19,249
I love you.

46
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:23,796
Perfect timing, kid.

47
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,416
Cal?

48
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,881
In here.

49
00:06:34,358 --> 00:06:36,497
You, uh, conserving electricity?

50
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,725
Yeah, on a cop salary, you betcha.

51
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,232
So...

52
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:43,441
So...

53
00:06:44,406 --> 00:06:45,388
You called me.

54
00:06:46,263 --> 00:06:49,492
I thought we talked about
going in the morning.

55
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:52,715
You want to go now?

56
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:54,802
Why not?

57
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:56,660
Did you tell Mary?

58
00:06:58,295 --> 00:06:59,189
Yeah, I told her.

59
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:00,981
What'd she say?

60
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:08,915
Jesus.

61
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:11,861
Don't! Get it up!

62
00:07:14,807 --> 00:07:16,084
Don't look away, jack.

63
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:17,392
Look at your handiwork!

64
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:20,755
I said look!

65
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:31,025
You might as well pull
the trigger yourself, buddy boy.

66
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,403
What does it have to...?

67
00:07:32,663 --> 00:07:34,223
What'd you think was
gonna happen, Jack?

68
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:40,369
I turn myself in. You become
a big hero bringing in the dirty cop,

69
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:41,932
ex-partner to boot.

70
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:46,479
Cal, I can help.
I can help you. I can.

71
00:07:47,287 --> 00:07:50,964
Thanks, Jack. But I think
I can handle it from here.

72
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,974
Hello.

73
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:12,783
Dr. Chetwyn? It's Imogene O'Neill.

74
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:16,562
Imogene. Uh, sweetheart...

75
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:19,094
We have an emergency,
and Dr. Lehman...

76
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:22,452
An emergency?
You mean another emergency?

77
00:08:22,584 --> 00:08:23,445
Dr. Chetwyn...

78
00:08:23,608 --> 00:08:27,153
Now, if you had
just taken the job at JPL,

79
00:08:27,672 --> 00:08:31,185
you wouldn't always be off on
these wild goose chases with Daniel.

80
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,230
No, no. It's not a goose chase.

81
00:08:33,368 --> 00:08:35,255
Okay. I'm gonna put you
on speakerphone.

82
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:39,189
Asteroid 114 Kassandra
is coming right at us.

83
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,524
I need you to get to sac-norad on this.

84
00:08:41,656 --> 00:08:44,591
Kassandra is a main belt asteroid,
Daniel.

85
00:08:44,728 --> 00:08:47,281
It's a minor planet, for god's sake.

86
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:53,167
Its closest pass to us is 400,000 miles
outside of earth's orbit.

87
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:56,368
And she was knocked off course
after an impact with a comet.

88
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,154
You might be able to see her
with near earth radar by morning.

89
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:03,445
But by then, it'll be too late.
Get to JPL now! We don't have...

90
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,518
Ah, we don't have much time.

91
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:07,063
Oh, god, Daniel.

92
00:09:07,577 --> 00:09:09,464
Daniel, go to bed, all right?

93
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:11,829
I'll look into it
when I get to the office.

94
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,854
We're coming right to you.

95
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,229
We have the numbers to show you.

96
00:09:14,361 --> 00:09:16,117
But right now, every minute counts.

97
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:19,634
The harbingers that
are being knocked loose

98
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,395
by the initial collision
are already here.

99
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:23,384
We have maybe 24 hours before...

100
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:27,310
I know what harbingers are,
Dr. Lehman.

101
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:34,293
They belong to you, don't they?

102
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,888
They're the reason you're alive now.

103
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:40,051
You took my family from me, Jack.

104
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,793
Now I'm gonna return the favor.

105
00:09:47,001 --> 00:09:48,430
I'm gonna pay a little visit

106
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:51,862
to jenny out there at
that fancy college of hers.

107
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:58,959
Oh, your dad lives out that way too,
doesn't he?

108
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:03,735
Convenient.

109
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,213
Mom, dad, wake up.

110
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:38,927
- What?
- What, baby?

111
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:40,278
What, Mikey?

112
00:10:40,698 --> 00:10:41,745
You gotta check this out.

113
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:42,967
You okay?

114
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:46,830
Okay.

115
00:10:52,794 --> 00:10:55,576
Oh, wow. That's cool.

116
00:10:57,242 --> 00:10:58,104
Russ.

117
00:10:58,938 --> 00:11:00,312
Come here, quick. Have a look.

118
00:11:03,674 --> 00:11:04,688
- Come on.
- I'm comin'.

119
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:09,622
That's amazing.

120
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:14,006
It's bright.

121
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:15,703
Yeah.

122
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:21,653
It's... it's kind of...

123
00:11:23,003 --> 00:11:24,312
Back away from the window.

124
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,054
Go! Go! Down in the cellar!

125
00:11:35,898 --> 00:11:37,108
Now, when you get there,
I want you to call me.

126
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:38,807
Grandpa, it's gonna be too late.

127
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:40,345
- I don't care how late it is.
- Keith.

128
00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:42,770
It's Russ Hapscomb.
There... there's a fire at his place.

129
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:44,532
He said a meteor
crashed in his field.

130
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:45,266
What?

131
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:47,924
All right,
get the fire department up there.

132
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:49,007
We'll be right behind 'em.

133
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:49,746
Yes, sir.

134
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:51,765
I gotta run, sweetheart.

135
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:53,273
Did he really just say meteor?

136
00:11:53,403 --> 00:11:55,225
The boy's got an imagination.

137
00:11:55,579 --> 00:11:56,986
Now, listen, I want you
to drive the speed limit.

138
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:57,976
Okay.

139
00:11:58,107 --> 00:11:58,870
Give me a hug.

140
00:12:00,635 --> 00:12:01,267
I love you, grandpa.

141
00:12:01,403 --> 00:12:02,483
I love you too, sweetheart.

142
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:03,930
Thanks for coming.

143
00:12:17,211 --> 00:12:19,186
I know that you're not
a huge fan of Dr. Chetwyn.

144
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:21,395
But don't you think
he's gonna figure this all out

145
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:23,800
when he gets to JPL
and looks at the radar readouts?

146
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:26,484
I mean, wh... why are we...
why are we going?

147
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:28,692
We were the only
ones monitoring the initial impact,

148
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:31,827
so they'll need our data to
plot an intercept trajectory.

149
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:35,001
Plus, none of their systems
allow for enough variables.

150
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:42,646
Look, Dr. Lehman, please don't
take this the wrong way but...

151
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:44,727
Come on out with it.

152
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:48,022
Why are we going?
He didn't believe you.

153
00:12:48,155 --> 00:12:50,042
Trust me, he'll believe us
when we get there.

154
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:51,219
Why?

155
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,387
Because by then,
lots more rocks will have fallen.

156
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,912
Lots more people will be dead.

157
00:13:16,316 --> 00:13:17,264
Ladies and gentlemen,

158
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:19,923
you were awoken from your beds

159
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,336
and flown here
in the dead of the night

160
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,093
because somewhere in your past,

161
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:27,122
you either volunteered for or were
volunteered by your agency for a seat

162
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:30,608
on the near Earth Object
Emergency Response Task Force.

163
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,086
Now, for those of you
who don't know me,

164
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,641
I'm General Brasser of
the Army Space Program,

165
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,326
and I have been appointed by
the president to lead this task force

166
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,315
in solving the crisis we face today.

167
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,900
Put simply,
an interplanetary dust storm

168
00:13:43,036 --> 00:13:44,410
seems to be headed our way.

169
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,598
Uh, hi. Um... Nate Chetwyn, JPL.

170
00:13:48,732 --> 00:13:51,252
Ah, the rocket scientist. Welcome.

171
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,326
In the last six hours,
we've had multiple meteor impacts

172
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,151
on the west coast of the United States.

173
00:13:56,284 --> 00:13:59,415
We're still compiling data from
the navy and various satellites.

174
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:00,496
But we can estimate that

175
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:03,538
there have been at least other impacts
in the Pacific Ocean.

176
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:08,055
Now, Dr. Chetwyn, I assume
you've got a team tracking this.

177
00:14:08,188 --> 00:14:10,774
Well, l... I've only recently
been briefed on all of this.

178
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:13,243
The... the information's
been trickling in and...

179
00:14:14,364 --> 00:14:17,528
But yes, um, we...
we got word a few hours ago

180
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,883
from one of our observatories
in the meteor tracking network.

181
00:14:22,013 --> 00:14:24,533
Now, the...
the data is still being verified.

182
00:14:24,668 --> 00:14:29,458
But, um, there is the possibility
that a comet has struck an asteroid.

183
00:14:29,597 --> 00:14:31,899
And if that's true, then the increased

184
00:14:32,029 --> 00:14:34,615
meteor activity
we're experiencing is the, uh,

185
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,342
debris from that initial collision.

186
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:37,786
How big can these rocks get?

187
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:40,121
Anything from a pebble to
the size of a truck.

188
00:14:40,253 --> 00:14:41,268
And the bad news?

189
00:14:41,436 --> 00:14:45,015
The comet collision may have altered

190
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:48,084
the parent asteroid's
trajectory enough that...

191
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:50,936
it may be on its way to us, too.

192
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:52,476
Size? Mass? Velocity?

193
00:14:52,605 --> 00:14:53,684
He's calculating that as we speak.

194
00:14:53,821 --> 00:14:54,868
The worst-case scenario.

195
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:59,162
We may be looking at 114th Kassandra,
a main belt asteroid.

196
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:03,003
It's large enough to be
considered a small planet.

197
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:06,035
She's 60 miles in diameter
and her impact with earth

198
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:08,923
would be enough to end life
as we know it.

199
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:11,835
You want the worst-case scenario.

200
00:15:11,965 --> 00:15:12,728
Time till impact?

201
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:13,624
Still calculating.

202
00:15:13,757 --> 00:15:17,336
But my... my best guesstimate
is 24-48 hours.

203
00:15:17,693 --> 00:15:18,838
Unfortunately, if it is Kassandra,

204
00:15:18,973 --> 00:15:20,664
you're gonna have to
destroy her long before that,

205
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:24,594
because if... if we hit her when
she's too low in our atmosphere,

206
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:27,515
the... the debris fallout
from the explosion...

207
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:31,574
It would be catastrophic.

208
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:34,298
Okay, people. We got our hands full.
Let's get moving.

209
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,394
Dr. Chetwyn, I need a full workup
on the asteroid we're dealing with

210
00:15:38,526 --> 00:15:40,828
and a trajectory for
an ideal interception point.

211
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:42,899
And I need it in minutes or less.

212
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:49,203
I know it's early.
Don't tell me how early it is.

213
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:51,032
I need you
at your desk in ten minutes.

214
00:15:51,261 --> 00:15:52,788
And get me Dr. Lehman now.

215
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:00,951
Just gonna get your numbers, sir.

216
00:16:04,286 --> 00:16:04,984
Okay.

217
00:16:05,118 --> 00:16:09,657
Trust me. Stark's not gonna get far.
Jack, I'm gonna do everything I can.

218
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,540
Jesus, cap, that's not enough.
It's Calvin.

219
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,637
You know him.
Look, this is jenny we're talking about.

220
00:16:15,838 --> 00:16:16,634
I know, man.

221
00:16:17,022 --> 00:16:18,910
But do you see
what's goin' on out there?

222
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:20,216
Tom.

223
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:22,779
Tom, you used to bounce her
on your knee.

224
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:23,672
Please.

225
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,409
Well, he's not getting far, all right?

226
00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:35,325
Who is that? Is that about jenny?

227
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:37,045
It's the mayor.

228
00:16:37,502 --> 00:16:39,128
You call me if you hear anything.

229
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:42,206
Will do.
Now get some rest, would you?

230
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:55,705
Come on, baby.

231
00:16:55,967 --> 00:16:59,447
Sorry, all circuits are busy.
Please try your call again later.

232
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,816
We're following this breaking story.

233
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:17,780
The AP is reporting a large meteor
impact in Taft, California,

234
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:19,991
with additional impacts
in other areas along

235
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,200
the west coast and the Pacific Ocean.

236
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,413
NASA officials have scheduled

237
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,820
a press conference
one half hour from now.

238
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,609
And we expect
some answers regarding

239
00:17:27,743 --> 00:17:32,085
what seems to be
the largest in recorded history.

240
00:17:32,223 --> 00:17:33,400
Small meteors collide with the earth

241
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:36,568
all the time but the impact
is so minor...

242
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,676
Hey, you guys, check it out.

243
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:51,189
It's beautiful.

244
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,124
I bet it's even better up
in the mountains. Come on.

245
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,461
Hey.

246
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:03,924
Forget something?

247
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:09,465
Oh, thank you. Maya, you rock.
Best roommate ever.

248
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,247
Come on. We gotta roll.

249
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:15,674
See ya.

250
00:18:52,704 --> 00:18:53,783
This is awful.

251
00:18:57,408 --> 00:18:58,302
Yeah.

252
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:00,699
Hey.

253
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,451
We got out, right?

254
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:06,841
Do you want me to stay home?

255
00:19:07,328 --> 00:19:10,809
No, no, no. You... you go on.
Someone's got to pay the bills.

256
00:19:12,064 --> 00:19:13,274
Yeah, but you shouldn't have to
deal with all this by yourself.

257
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:15,416
Hey, hey, at least someone's
enjoying this.

258
00:19:20,385 --> 00:19:21,246
He's still here?

259
00:19:22,016 --> 00:19:24,089
Yeah. We missed the bus
in all the excitement.

260
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:25,114
I'll take him in.

261
00:19:25,281 --> 00:19:26,077
No, no. I'll do it.

262
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:28,797
It'll give us
some good mother/son time.

263
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:34,556
Hey, kid! Let's go.
Time for school. The limo's leavin'.

264
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:36,853
Shouldn't I stay and help?

265
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:41,404
Nice try. Come on. Get in the car.
I'll try to get off early, all right?

266
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:48,060
Hey, Russell!
The firemen tell me it's safe now.

267
00:19:48,577 --> 00:19:49,787
You might want to come take a look.

268
00:19:51,553 --> 00:19:52,480
Well, how bad is it?

269
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:54,647
See for yourself.

270
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:05,440
You get a chance to
watch the news this morning?

271
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:07,063
No, the power's still out.

272
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:13,055
Well, apparently, uh, a few of
these things hit some time last night.

273
00:20:16,225 --> 00:20:17,785
Some kind of freak meteor shower.

274
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:21,114
Most of them landed in the pacific,
except for this one.

275
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:48,600
Ooh, hi. My radiator overheated.
Can I get water?

276
00:20:57,538 --> 00:20:58,715
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

277
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,744
Have a good day.

278
00:21:01,122 --> 00:21:03,391
Suspect is still at large. Repeat.

279
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,554
Detective Calvin Stark is
considered armed and dangerous.

280
00:21:06,786 --> 00:21:09,175
Use extreme caution. All units.

281
00:21:09,314 --> 00:21:14,911
All units respond a 511
at 11465 High View Drive.

282
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:25,469
Hello.

283
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:28,157
Imogene, it's Nate Chetwyn.
Is Daniel with you?

284
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:29,021
I'm right here.

285
00:21:29,506 --> 00:21:33,499
Dan. I'm sorry.
L... I was wrong about Kassandra.

286
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:36,249
Have you had a chance to
calculate trajectory?

287
00:21:36,386 --> 00:21:38,142
You're breaking up. Call us back.

288
00:21:38,274 --> 00:21:40,380
We're standing by
for a missile launch.

289
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:43,514
No, no! Don't launch!
You don't have the trajectory right!

290
00:21:44,226 --> 00:21:45,120
Hello?

291
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:49,560
He doesn't have
the original impact coordinates.

292
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,421
He's using an algorithm
I gave him years ago.

293
00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:52,864
They're gonna miss. Get him back!

294
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:56,514
No signal.

295
00:21:58,402 --> 00:21:59,449
Ha. He said sorry.

296
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:00,282
What?

297
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:03,549
He apologized.
I think he actually apologized.

298
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:08,480
Oh, great.

299
00:22:18,114 --> 00:22:20,765
No, ma'am, I'm not trying to
tell you how to do your job.

300
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:23,713
But you need to get the president to
address the country right away

301
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,785
or we will have widespread panic.

302
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:27,806
Thank you, ma'am.

303
00:22:28,258 --> 00:22:30,625
Sir. Just heard from NASA.

304
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:33,371
Near-earth satellite radar confirms
that it's 114 Kassandra.

305
00:22:33,506 --> 00:22:35,329
Colonel Beck,
how long till missile launch?

306
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:36,255
Twenty-one minutes, sir.

307
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,110
Perfect. Let's get a live feed in five.

308
00:22:38,243 --> 00:22:39,901
Yes, sir. And I still need the...

309
00:22:40,035 --> 00:22:42,075
Dr. Chetwyn,
how about those coordinates?

310
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:44,316
I've got them, sir.
I'm just double-checking them.

311
00:22:44,451 --> 00:22:45,400
We need them now.

312
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:49,662
Okay. You got it.

313
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:50,589
I got it.

314
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:51,517
Perfect.

315
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,506
You've reached the cell phone of
Dr. Lehman. Please leave a message.

316
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:58,553
Dr. Lehman, Imogene, it... it's Nate.

317
00:22:58,691 --> 00:22:59,968
We're... we're about to launch,

318
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:02,433
and I need to confirm
the kassandra trajectory with you.

319
00:23:02,563 --> 00:23:04,952
There's... there's something wrong
with the numbers.

320
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:08,059
Just call, call, call.

321
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,093
- Whoa!
- Watch out, sorry.

322
00:23:27,812 --> 00:23:29,754
Will you help me out, please?
Thank you.

323
00:23:38,404 --> 00:23:40,291
Russell Hapscomb, meteor man.

324
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,729
Simon. Long time.

325
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,972
Yeah, a long time.

326
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:43,999
Hey, what's goin' on here?

327
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,659
I thought my house
was the only one that got hit.

328
00:23:45,988 --> 00:23:48,192
Some fema guy told people
to stock up so...

329
00:23:48,324 --> 00:23:48,706
Wow.

330
00:23:48,836 --> 00:23:50,080
Yeah. Wow is right.

331
00:23:50,436 --> 00:23:52,607
Hey! That's my water.

332
00:23:52,772 --> 00:23:53,535
You got your name on this?

333
00:23:53,668 --> 00:23:56,156
I'm over here getting milk
before they run out of that too.

334
00:23:56,452 --> 00:23:57,597
Yeah, well, look, sorry, sir.

335
00:23:57,732 --> 00:24:00,961
I said that's my water.
It's for my family.

336
00:24:01,475 --> 00:24:02,403
Hey, relax...

337
00:24:03,588 --> 00:24:05,563
Why don't you
just get your ass out of my town

338
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,522
and crawl back to
where you came from?

339
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:09,026
Come again?

340
00:24:11,204 --> 00:24:13,343
Just let's let it go.
He's not worth it.

341
00:24:13,956 --> 00:24:14,849
Yeah, let it go.

342
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,190
There's more water over there.

343
00:24:19,844 --> 00:24:22,746
You have yourself a nice day... sir.

344
00:24:30,565 --> 00:24:31,677
Heard what he said to me?

345
00:24:32,004 --> 00:24:32,735
Yeah, I heard.

346
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:37,017
I was born here.

347
00:24:37,156 --> 00:24:37,854
Some mouth.

348
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:40,387
Yeah. That mouth gonna
get his ass cancelled.

349
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,634
You did the right thing.

350
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:58,109
Damn it. I think it's dead. Sorry.

351
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:00,765
Don't panic.
We have to keep our heads.

352
00:25:01,637 --> 00:25:04,637
See if you can wave someone down.
They always stop for a girl.

353
00:25:06,308 --> 00:25:08,959
Hey! Hey, stop!

354
00:25:11,013 --> 00:25:14,177
Great. Hey, look.

355
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:21,792
I'll get the phone.

356
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:26,401
Hey!

357
00:25:27,077 --> 00:25:31,899
Dr. Lehman. Dr. Lehman!
Oh, God. Dr. Lehman.

358
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:34,653
The laptop.

359
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:42,076
Don't speak. Shh, don't try to speak.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god, Dr. Lehman.

360
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:43,331
Get it.

361
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:44,770
No.

362
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:48,511
Dr. Lehman.

363
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,130
Dr. Lehman!

364
00:25:53,925 --> 00:25:56,097
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

365
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:09,018
Now here's a list of alternate routes to
get you home from our eye in the sky.

366
00:26:09,157 --> 00:26:12,703
If you're trying to head north
from the 405, allow for extra time.

367
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:13,601
Make sure you...

368
00:26:14,821 --> 00:26:17,342
Come on, answer, baby. Answer.

369
00:26:18,086 --> 00:26:20,257
Hi, it's jenny. Leave a message.

370
00:26:20,677 --> 00:26:24,060
Jenny. Listen to me. It's your dad.
Listen very carefully.

371
00:26:24,198 --> 00:26:26,270
You are in real danger.

372
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:30,273
Stark, my... my ex-partner, Calvin Stark.
You remember him?

373
00:26:30,502 --> 00:26:31,909
Well, he's done something terrible,
baby.

374
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:33,762
You are in danger, okay?

375
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:35,836
As soon as you get this message,
you need to call-

376
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:37,949
no, you need to run to
the police station in town

377
00:26:38,086 --> 00:26:39,362
and have them call me

378
00:26:39,494 --> 00:26:44,251
or Captain Finnegan at
LAPD precinct immediately.

379
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:49,125
All right? This is for real, baby.
All right? I love you.

380
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:51,709
Just go. Go now.

381
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,146
Due to the unpredictable nature of

382
00:26:58,278 --> 00:27:01,147
the current meteor shower crisis,
all motorists...

383
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,334
Told you, I knew a shortcut.

384
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:05,058
Yeah, it sure beats the parking
lot on the side.

385
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,714
It is recommended that
all drivers safely exit

386
00:27:07,846 --> 00:27:10,912
and proceed to
the nearest public shelter.

387
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,224
Maybe we should go back.

388
00:27:13,094 --> 00:27:13,661
Why?

389
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,424
I mean, things are falling
out of the sky.

390
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:17,282
They're telling people to
stay off the road.

391
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,104
People are sheep. They overreact.

392
00:27:23,654 --> 00:27:29,088
Just think... hot tub. Hot tub. Hot tub.

393
00:27:29,223 --> 00:27:30,270
I'm serious.

394
00:27:30,406 --> 00:27:32,927
Me too. There's also
a fully stocked bar.

395
00:27:33,063 --> 00:27:35,070
Forty acres of pristine forest.

396
00:27:40,071 --> 00:27:45,341
Hey, babe. If the world's ending,
I'd rather be with you.

397
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:47,777
Thanks.

398
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:51,742
You are so full of it.

399
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:55,106
Come on. That was for real.

400
00:27:55,335 --> 00:27:58,434
Yeah. Mm-mm-mm-mm.

401
00:27:58,695 --> 00:28:02,143
I tell you what, if you're a good boy
the rest of the way,

402
00:28:03,591 --> 00:28:05,315
I might let you fish that out.

403
00:28:05,479 --> 00:28:06,723
Oww!

404
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,563
You stopped a fight over water?

405
00:28:22,696 --> 00:28:23,906
Yeah. I'm telling you,
our house gets hit,

406
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,494
but it's everyone else around here
who's freakin' out.

407
00:28:26,951 --> 00:28:27,714
You okay?

408
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:28,927
Yeah, I'm fine.

409
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,298
Just fixin' up the windows
before Michael gets home.

410
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:33,190
I hear they're letting
the kids out early.

411
00:28:33,575 --> 00:28:36,445
- Dr. Hapscomb, we need you stat.
- All right?

412
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:38,471
You heard that, babe.
I love you. I gotta go.

413
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:42,908
Watch it. Oh!

414
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:43,842
Excuse me!

415
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,655
Oh, come on. What are you doing?
Out of my way.

416
00:28:46,888 --> 00:28:49,222
Oh, I'm... that's rude.

417
00:28:49,672 --> 00:28:50,850
Sorry, sorry.

418
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:08,382
They've been all over the radio and TV.

419
00:29:08,552 --> 00:29:10,788
What was it fema said?
What was his big message?

420
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,110
Stay off the roads like it's
some freakin' kind of travel advisory.

421
00:29:15,368 --> 00:29:16,612
Unbelievable.

422
00:29:16,904 --> 00:29:18,912
That's your tax dollars
at work right there.

423
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,702
I've been all over town.

424
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,524
People starting' to
hoard food and supplies.

425
00:29:23,656 --> 00:29:25,990
Next thing, everyone's gonna be
holed up in their houses.

426
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,575
And that's when the lowlifes are
gonna be coming' out of the woodwork.

427
00:29:28,712 --> 00:29:30,468
Havin' a slow day at the garage?

428
00:29:33,096 --> 00:29:33,827
Hello, chief.

429
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:38,727
Dwight.
You boys, uh, plannin' a huntin' trip?

430
00:29:38,889 --> 00:29:41,539
Well, you know,
duck season's right around the corner.

431
00:29:42,856 --> 00:29:45,223
Well, today might be
a good day to stay indoors.

432
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,606
Yeah. But what
if you have some real trouble?

433
00:29:49,897 --> 00:29:52,286
You're gonna need
some god-fearin' boys at your side.

434
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:55,108
What I need is for people to
stay nice and calm,

435
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:57,408
not runnin' around with weapons.

436
00:30:00,201 --> 00:30:03,430
I don't recall martial law
being declared.

437
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:05,223
We have the right to assemble.

438
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:12,550
Dwight... You are beginning to annoy me.
That would not be in your best interest.

439
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:13,759
Are you threatening me?

440
00:30:14,216 --> 00:30:17,893
I'm not threatening you.
I'm just tellin' you how it is.

441
00:30:20,169 --> 00:30:23,268
Now I suggest you take care of
your families rather than your guns.

442
00:30:41,641 --> 00:30:45,602
So, uh, where in Los Angeles you...
you need to go?

443
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:50,469
Uh, JPL. Jet Propulsion Laboratories.

444
00:30:50,857 --> 00:30:54,948
It's just off the 210th.
Thanks for picking me up.

445
00:30:58,377 --> 00:31:02,719
You remind me of my daughter.
And I never let her walk alone.

446
00:31:18,345 --> 00:31:21,574
As of yet, we have heard
no official word on what's going on.

447
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:23,556
But with the meteor strikes increasing,

448
00:31:23,689 --> 00:31:27,202
what started out as
an especially beautiful sunrise

449
00:31:27,402 --> 00:31:31,941
might turn out to be the first
warning sign of a national emergency.

450
00:31:50,154 --> 00:31:51,398
Maybe they'll
cancel school tomorrow.

451
00:31:52,841 --> 00:31:57,446
- Aw, Mickey's got a girlfriend!
- Hey, if you ever want a real man...

452
00:31:57,578 --> 00:31:58,439
Leave her alone.

453
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,585
Or what?

454
00:32:03,594 --> 00:32:04,543
He ain't gonna help you.

455
00:32:04,874 --> 00:32:06,368
Doofus can't protect his woman.

456
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:06,975
Nope.

457
00:32:07,466 --> 00:32:08,132
Quit it.

458
00:32:10,026 --> 00:32:12,611
Oh, is doofus gonna cry?

459
00:32:14,826 --> 00:32:15,971
Big mistake.

460
00:32:32,906 --> 00:32:33,767
Coordinates confirmed?

461
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:36,518
Yeah.

462
00:32:36,683 --> 00:32:38,276
Your confidence is overwhelming.

463
00:32:40,554 --> 00:32:41,318
Punch it.

464
00:32:42,955 --> 00:32:43,751
We're locked in.

465
00:32:43,882 --> 00:32:44,711
Launch codes.

466
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,119
Hot and ready, sir.

467
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,297
We're go for launch, sir.

468
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:49,578
Call it, colonel.

469
00:32:49,931 --> 00:33:02,053
On my mark, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3...

470
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:13,095
Talk to me, people.

471
00:33:13,226 --> 00:33:14,852
We... we lost 'em, sir. L-I got no feeds.

472
00:33:14,987 --> 00:33:16,394
Me neither. They're off line.

473
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,512
The satellite.

474
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:19,241
Speak up.

475
00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:21,667
Are we on satellite com link
with the launch site?

476
00:33:21,803 --> 00:33:22,152
That's right.

477
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:23,592
I think the satellite got hit.

478
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:26,219
The harbingers.

479
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,867
The... the debris from
the initial comet impact.

480
00:33:29,739 --> 00:33:34,562
Quigley. Yes. Yes. Confirmed?
Yes. Roger that. Please stand by.

481
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:37,415
Sir, missiles are intact.
We just lost the satellite feeds.

482
00:33:39,915 --> 00:33:40,547
Recommendations.

483
00:33:40,683 --> 00:33:42,472
Launch based on
the trajectory model, sir.

484
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:47,523
No. No! Without satellite guidance,
l... I advise against that.

485
00:33:47,724 --> 00:33:50,626
The trajectory computation,
it... it's not foolproof.

486
00:33:50,764 --> 00:33:52,008
I need more time.

487
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:52,805
Christ.

488
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,801
Well, I'm sorry.

489
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:56,998
I don't think we should be hurling
nuclear weapons blindly!

490
00:33:57,132 --> 00:33:57,863
Pardon me, Dr. Chetwyn,

491
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:00,002
but what the hell have you been
doing all this time?

492
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,576
The best I can.

493
00:34:02,636 --> 00:34:05,386
We've never dealt with
this big an asteroid mass,

494
00:34:05,708 --> 00:34:06,536
and not at this proximity.

495
00:34:06,668 --> 00:34:08,642
And the... the algorithm
I'm using isn't working.

496
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,885
For some reason,
I can't reach the man that created it.

497
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,711
Well, find him for Christ's sake!
Where is he?

498
00:34:13,515 --> 00:34:15,010
He's on his way in from Mexico.

499
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:15,682
Mexico?

500
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,853
What the hell is he doing in Mexico
if he's so integral to this whole thing?

501
00:34:18,988 --> 00:34:21,922
I fired him. He went crazy.

502
00:34:24,748 --> 00:34:26,373
Help Dr. Chetwyn to find his man.

503
00:34:26,508 --> 00:34:27,304
Get the White House involved.

504
00:34:27,436 --> 00:34:28,680
Call in the god damn marines.

505
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:31,496
We need that trajectory on
this thing right away, now!

506
00:34:41,676 --> 00:34:45,353
I'm sorry, but it's not my fault.
The thing overheated, okay?

507
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:53,832
The car is a piece of crap. Yeah?
Oh, that's nice. Nice. Yeah. Jackass!

508
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:56,353
Sorry, ma'am. LAPD.

509
00:34:56,492 --> 00:34:57,736
I'm gonna have to
commandeer your vehicle.

510
00:34:57,868 --> 00:34:58,882
Police emergency.

511
00:34:59,021 --> 00:35:01,355
You gave me a heart attack.

512
00:35:01,612 --> 00:35:03,434
Step away from the car, please.

513
00:35:03,692 --> 00:35:04,739
Have you seen
what's happening out there?

514
00:35:04,877 --> 00:35:05,738
I gotta get home.

515
00:35:05,868 --> 00:35:08,389
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to insist.

516
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:11,755
Officer, please.

517
00:35:11,884 --> 00:35:13,477
Please, I live
all the way in Palm Vista.

518
00:35:13,613 --> 00:35:16,580
My kids are waiting.
I'll never make it on foot.

519
00:35:16,716 --> 00:35:19,498
Palm Vista.
You live out near the college?

520
00:35:19,629 --> 00:35:20,523
Yeah.

521
00:35:22,157 --> 00:35:24,808
My lucky day. Do you mind
if I bother you for a ride?

522
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:31,523
Yes. Of course I'll take you
wherever you need to go. Pop in.

523
00:35:31,661 --> 00:35:32,773
Well, thank you, ma'am.

524
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:49,541
Still nothing?

525
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:51,145
Nada.

526
00:36:03,981 --> 00:36:05,672
The little one starts school today.

527
00:36:07,661 --> 00:36:08,643
I'm sorry.

528
00:36:09,197 --> 00:36:11,107
Oh, no. It's okay. It's okay.

529
00:36:20,718 --> 00:36:24,427
Is okay if I, uh, get you to border?

530
00:36:25,293 --> 00:36:28,588
No, no. Look, I really...
I have to...

531
00:36:28,717 --> 00:36:30,626
I'm very sorry, senorita.

532
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:33,286
L... I just need to get to
my familia, you know.

533
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:35,047
Of course.

534
00:36:38,702 --> 00:36:40,163
Wait. Is that a police station?

535
00:36:41,134 --> 00:36:41,962
Si!

536
00:36:42,509 --> 00:36:46,786
Great. Well, maybe they could
radio the embassy or call JPL for me.

537
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:50,187
Very good idea, senorita.
Yes, very good.

538
00:36:58,446 --> 00:37:01,512
Gracias. Thank you so much.

539
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:02,666
De nada.

540
00:37:02,958 --> 00:37:05,031
Are you sure you're
going to be okay?

541
00:37:05,262 --> 00:37:08,611
Si. Yeah.
You go home to your family.

542
00:37:08,814 --> 00:37:10,669
Gracias. Buenas suerte.

543
00:37:11,182 --> 00:37:12,458
Good luck to you too.

544
00:38:01,294 --> 00:38:02,123
Oh, god.

545
00:38:05,807 --> 00:38:07,083
Yeah. It's a big rock.

546
00:38:07,406 --> 00:38:10,057
And lift. Got it?

547
00:38:20,975 --> 00:38:22,437
Double check that fuel line.

548
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:26,283
Come on, let's go.

549
00:38:29,711 --> 00:38:30,442
Hey!

550
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:32,748
What about the rest of these kids?

551
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:33,641
We're full up.

552
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:35,470
We gotta take this group to...
to High View

553
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,940
and this next one gotta
go to coast central.

554
00:38:37,071 --> 00:38:38,380
You've only got one ambulance?

555
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:40,710
We got accidents all over.
It's insane.

556
00:38:41,615 --> 00:38:42,597
I don't believe it.

557
00:38:51,535 --> 00:38:53,739
All right, I want you to get over to

558
00:38:53,872 --> 00:38:56,108
Dylan's car dealership
as soon as possible.

559
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:58,094
Round up every available man.

560
00:38:58,224 --> 00:39:01,519
Get every truck and van over here
just as soon as you can.

561
00:39:11,471 --> 00:39:12,137
Michael?

562
00:39:16,175 --> 00:39:19,209
You just take it easy, son.
You're gonna be fine.

563
00:39:20,015 --> 00:39:21,357
Uh, we'll get you to the hospital

564
00:39:21,488 --> 00:39:24,586
and I'll make sure your mom
and dad are there to meet you, okay?

565
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:36,107
Sir, everyone's losing
satellite coverage,

566
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,280
NSA, Pentagon, commercial networks.

567
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,902
How big can these dust storms get?

568
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:43,242
Don't think of it as dust.

569
00:39:43,376 --> 00:39:45,416
I'm sure our satellite
and every satellite worldwide

570
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:46,894
is gettin' shredded to pieces.

571
00:39:47,024 --> 00:39:47,918
Let's not lose it, people.

572
00:39:48,048 --> 00:39:49,738
We won the second
World War without satellites.

573
00:39:49,872 --> 00:39:53,167
We're not gonna give it up now.
Ground wire all communications.

574
00:39:53,328 --> 00:39:57,038
Sir. What if he can't solve it?

575
00:39:57,168 --> 00:39:59,950
Well, at some point, the thing
will be visible on ground radar.

576
00:40:00,656 --> 00:40:01,322
Which is another reason that

577
00:40:01,456 --> 00:40:03,911
I think we should save
our biggest missiles for them.

578
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:07,084
We also may be underestimating
the amount of firepower

579
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:08,263
we're gonna need here.

580
00:40:08,401 --> 00:40:12,808
Colonel Beck has targeted
for 500 missions in his career.

581
00:40:12,945 --> 00:40:15,847
General, we're not talking about
a surgical strike on Baghdad.

582
00:40:15,985 --> 00:40:18,123
You're trying to pulverize
a giant rock

583
00:40:18,257 --> 00:40:20,079
that's four times
the size of Manhattan into

584
00:40:20,208 --> 00:40:22,445
tiny little pieces small enough
so the fallout,

585
00:40:22,576 --> 00:40:25,959
if we're lucky enough to hit it,
doesn't kill us anyway.

586
00:40:26,096 --> 00:40:28,714
We got one chance at this thing.
I think we all better get it right.

587
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:36,560
We'll take that under advisement.
I want you to get your numbers straight.

588
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:42,183
Hello.

589
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,655
What? Where?

590
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,796
Where?! I'm coming.

591
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:05,136
Hey, how ya holdin' up?

592
00:41:05,393 --> 00:41:05,840
I'm fine.

593
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:09,318
Thanks for checkin' in
and thanks for the wheels.

594
00:41:09,649 --> 00:41:10,248
I owe ya.

595
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:13,805
You're gonna be putting my kids
through college after they fire my ass.

596
00:41:15,537 --> 00:41:17,992
You won't get fired.
I'll get Finnegan to vouch for you.

597
00:41:18,481 --> 00:41:20,369
All right. I trust you, handsome.

598
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:25,292
You're the woman of my dreams,
Trish. Gotta go.

599
00:41:45,073 --> 00:41:45,869
Hello?

600
00:41:48,017 --> 00:41:48,911
Hola.

601
00:41:52,274 --> 00:41:53,135
Hello.

602
00:41:55,985 --> 00:41:56,814
Hola.

603
00:42:02,801 --> 00:42:03,630
Hello.

604
00:42:07,538 --> 00:42:08,432
Hola.

605
00:42:16,978 --> 00:42:20,622
I'm sorry.
I didn't see you. No Io vi.

606
00:42:20,882 --> 00:42:22,376
Ah, Americana.

607
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,168
Si. Yes.

608
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:25,515
I have to get to

609
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,170
Jet Propulsion Laboratories
in Los Angeles.

610
00:42:28,306 --> 00:42:30,030
There's information on this computer

611
00:42:30,162 --> 00:42:33,904
that's very important
the government needs.

612
00:42:34,034 --> 00:42:35,757
L... I'm a scientist and I'm-

613
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:39,087
I'm working on the meteors
that are... that are coming down.

614
00:42:39,218 --> 00:42:41,390
It... it's very, very important.

615
00:42:41,522 --> 00:42:44,173
This, uh, very, um,
como se dice, importante?

616
00:42:44,306 --> 00:42:45,234
Urgent, huh?

617
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:46,475
Si. Yes.

618
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,715
Why don't you just call them
on the telefono?

619
00:42:48,882 --> 00:42:51,053
Yes. Right!

620
00:42:51,186 --> 00:42:53,041
Vamanos. Otro oficina.

621
00:42:55,026 --> 00:42:58,223
We have... they have phones, uh,
how you say, uh, long distance.

622
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,312
Oh, thank you.

623
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:00,880
Yeah. Office.

624
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:01,839
Okay.

625
00:43:13,746 --> 00:43:14,924
- Ow, please.
- What the hell, Carlo?

626
00:43:15,058 --> 00:43:17,447
Ella estaba snooping around.
She's alone.

627
00:43:17,586 --> 00:43:20,685
Please. Please, please.
I'm just trying to get to Los Angeles.

628
00:43:21,395 --> 00:43:22,704
She's kinda cute, huh?

629
00:43:36,147 --> 00:43:38,635
I mean, like this meteor thing,
I mean, sure, I'm worried.

630
00:43:38,771 --> 00:43:41,618
I mean, who wouldn't be?
But it's kind of exciting, you know?

631
00:43:41,875 --> 00:43:43,119
I mean, I'm no crazy,

632
00:43:43,251 --> 00:43:46,600
but I like a little adventure
every now and then.

633
00:43:50,803 --> 00:43:53,673
So are you married?

634
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:55,760
Yes.

635
00:43:56,755 --> 00:43:57,682
Happily?

636
00:43:59,412 --> 00:44:01,070
I guess I could tell you that.

637
00:44:01,491 --> 00:44:02,352
Yeah?

638
00:44:03,252 --> 00:44:04,681
But then I'd have to kill you.

639
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:15,315
That was good!
You actually had me on that one.

640
00:44:15,443 --> 00:44:16,653
You'd have to kill me.

641
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:28,779
Casualty report.

642
00:44:28,948 --> 00:44:31,435
Only 41 so far nationwide,
which is a minor miracle.

643
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:33,490
Injuries are in the hundreds, sir.

644
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,180
Last batch was
the second bus full of kids.

645
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:36,336
It's getting ugly.

646
00:44:37,396 --> 00:44:38,705
General, here you go.

647
00:44:39,283 --> 00:44:41,323
We need to get people underground.
How are we comin' with that?

648
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,209
We've opened shelters
in every conceivable location.

649
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:46,892
Underground parking lots,
malls, old bomb shelters,

650
00:44:47,028 --> 00:44:48,653
any tunnel
that's not jammed with traffic.

651
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:50,031
Even a few working mine shafts.

652
00:44:50,164 --> 00:44:51,058
And I've got word
from the pentagon

653
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,938
so we'll open civilian access to
subterranean facilities.

654
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:54,864
Mostly old missile storage in

655
00:44:54,995 --> 00:44:58,094
Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, and Kansas,
and working on more, sir.

656
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:00,116
General,
we've got an image on ground radar.

657
00:45:00,244 --> 00:45:01,357
On screen, please.

658
00:45:03,892 --> 00:45:05,386
Oh, my god, they're getting larger.

659
00:45:15,476 --> 00:45:17,003
Which one of these is Kassandra?

660
00:45:17,236 --> 00:45:18,730
We can't see kassandra yet.

661
00:45:19,476 --> 00:45:22,029
All right, people, things are
about to get a whole lot worse.

662
00:45:22,164 --> 00:45:23,626
We need to get people underground,

663
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:26,317
and we need to get the National Guard
out to guide them there.

664
00:45:26,452 --> 00:45:27,565
More importantly, Colonel Beck.

665
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,456
Uh, missile deployment nearly complete.

666
00:45:29,812 --> 00:45:31,667
We've got every
major population center covered

667
00:45:31,796 --> 00:45:35,277
with stingers and patriot batteries
in the rural areas.

668
00:45:35,413 --> 00:45:37,780
Roger that. Good work.
Okay, people. Let's move!

669
00:45:39,797 --> 00:45:40,363
Sir.

670
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:41,067
Did you find them?

671
00:45:41,204 --> 00:45:43,660
The Mexican police
found Dr. Lehman, sir.

672
00:45:44,085 --> 00:45:44,815
Excellent.

673
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:49,615
They found him dead, sir.
A suspected hit-and-run.

674
00:45:49,749 --> 00:45:51,025
What about Imogene, his assistant?

675
00:45:51,157 --> 00:45:54,418
They didn't find anyone else, sir.
I'm sorry.

676
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:10,443
Move out! Steady twos. Let's go.

677
00:46:11,444 --> 00:46:13,681
Roger, we're in position.
Permission to fire.

678
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,662
Charlie 11, Charlie 11.

679
00:46:15,797 --> 00:46:18,830
This is Charlie 01-.
Have visual contact.

680
00:46:20,533 --> 00:46:22,638
Let's go!
Roger, 22, we've got inner...

681
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:29,934
What the hell?

682
00:46:41,429 --> 00:46:42,476
What's the problem, officer?

683
00:46:42,677 --> 00:46:43,343
You'll have to turn back

684
00:46:43,477 --> 00:46:45,102
and exit at that detour sign you
just ignored.

685
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:46,611
That'll lead you to a pick-up point.

686
00:46:46,741 --> 00:46:48,148
They'll take you
to a shelter from there.

687
00:46:48,566 --> 00:46:50,158
I'm sorry, but that's unacceptable,
all right?

688
00:46:50,294 --> 00:46:52,017
Shut up. Do as he says.

689
00:47:21,494 --> 00:47:24,308
We have a mass casualty accident.
A spillover at Miami General.

690
00:47:24,565 --> 00:47:25,067
How many?

691
00:47:25,269 --> 00:47:26,895
Seven children. A school bus.

692
00:47:27,574 --> 00:47:30,062
Christ. Uh, how far away are they?

693
00:47:30,198 --> 00:47:30,797
They're here?

694
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:33,390
Here? Did they forgot to call ahead?

695
00:47:33,526 --> 00:47:36,875
Well, the phones are screwed up.
The radios are messy. Chelsea.

696
00:47:37,014 --> 00:47:38,672
What? What?

697
00:47:39,286 --> 00:47:42,766
The bus... it's from Michael's school.

698
00:47:44,406 --> 00:47:45,300
God.

699
00:47:49,974 --> 00:47:53,552
Okay, baby is hypo, 90 over 66.
Pulse is tachy. Internal injuries.

700
00:47:53,782 --> 00:47:57,295
I've got two units of plasma IV.
Push and prep for surgery. Go.

701
00:48:05,527 --> 00:48:06,475
Oh, god.

702
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,094
180 over 90. resp. Is shallow,
but pulse is holding up.

703
00:48:14,294 --> 00:48:14,926
Possible concussion.

704
00:48:15,063 --> 00:48:17,299
He's been out... doctor.

705
00:48:18,711 --> 00:48:20,566
Chelsea, what do we do?

706
00:48:20,694 --> 00:48:23,923
My baby. Oh, my baby.

707
00:48:24,055 --> 00:48:25,102
Dr. Hapscomb.

708
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:30,417
Uh, ten units of saline IV push,
x-ray and cat scan.

709
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:32,370
Move! Next patient.

710
00:48:41,047 --> 00:48:44,942
Oh. Oh, crap. The gas.

711
00:48:53,047 --> 00:48:55,218
God, I'm such an idiot.

712
00:48:55,383 --> 00:48:56,310
You hadn't filled up?

713
00:48:56,439 --> 00:48:58,511
No, I mean everything
was just so crazy,

714
00:48:58,647 --> 00:49:00,687
and I just...
just wanted to get home.

715
00:49:00,823 --> 00:49:02,863
You passed two or three gas stations.

716
00:49:03,095 --> 00:49:07,186
I know. Kind of funny, you know.

717
00:49:07,832 --> 00:49:09,719
- Shut up.
- It's just kind of funny.

718
00:49:09,847 --> 00:49:11,091
I mean, here I am...

719
00:49:11,223 --> 00:49:14,223
- Shut the hell up.
- Get off me.

720
00:49:32,215 --> 00:49:33,677
Hey, get you want to
bag these things, please?

721
00:49:33,815 --> 00:49:34,415
All right.

722
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:38,061
All right. This is ridiculous.
We're going as fast as we can, sir.

723
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:40,654
Well, you're not going fast enough.
I gotta get home to my kids.

724
00:49:40,824 --> 00:49:41,391
Can we go home?

725
00:49:41,528 --> 00:49:42,291
Hush.

726
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,785
Excuse me. Come on.

727
00:49:45,431 --> 00:49:49,839
Sir, you didn't pay for that.
Sir, freeze!

728
00:49:52,792 --> 00:49:55,825
Please, put those things down,
and get out.

729
00:49:56,024 --> 00:49:57,039
Man, I got kids.

730
00:49:57,176 --> 00:49:58,124
Let him go!

731
00:49:58,263 --> 00:49:58,994
Stop.

732
00:49:59,127 --> 00:50:02,608
Please. What are you gonna do,
shoot me over two gallons of water?

733
00:50:05,304 --> 00:50:06,929
No, but I sure the hell will.

734
00:50:07,863 --> 00:50:09,936
We ain't gonna put up
with any of this thievery.

735
00:50:11,192 --> 00:50:13,047
We're not gonna tolerate
any lawlessness.

736
00:50:13,592 --> 00:50:15,894
That's right, Dwight.
You're absolutely right.

737
00:50:16,024 --> 00:50:17,366
That's why you need to go home.

738
00:50:18,104 --> 00:50:20,308
I'm just trying to lend
a helping hand here, chief.

739
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,774
You've helped enough.
Time to go home now.

740
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,910
And if I see either of you boys
with your pea-shooters out again,

741
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,094
I will confiscate them, and I will
melt them down for scrap iron.

742
00:50:35,993 --> 00:50:37,105
Get him to the hospital.

743
00:50:37,624 --> 00:50:39,828
When he's up to it,
I suggest he press charges.

744
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:40,724
Yes, sir.

745
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:45,615
Things are starting to
fall apart here.

746
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:48,568
You know, I mean no disrespect,
but you're not getting any younger,

747
00:50:48,696 --> 00:50:51,631
and this place was being robbed,
and you came in way late.

748
00:50:51,768 --> 00:50:53,808
Please, just go. Okay, I'll settle...

749
00:50:53,944 --> 00:50:55,766
Hey, nobody's talking to you.

750
00:50:59,641 --> 00:51:02,707
Now get him home.
He needs to cool off.

751
00:51:03,033 --> 00:51:03,982
Get him some ice.

752
00:51:09,273 --> 00:51:12,950
There's no need for that.
You know, he's got a point.

753
00:51:13,337 --> 00:51:15,792
We're spending a lot of time
tearing each other apart.

754
00:51:16,376 --> 00:51:19,824
We need to lend each other a hand.
Now, I want you all to go home.

755
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,262
I want you to pick up your kids,
some food, some blankets,

756
00:51:22,392 --> 00:51:23,538
whatever medicine you need,

757
00:51:23,673 --> 00:51:25,877
and then head over to
the fallout shelter at the high school.

758
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:28,144
You'll be safe there.

759
00:51:28,633 --> 00:51:30,007
We'll do everything
we can to make you comfortable.

760
00:51:30,137 --> 00:51:33,170
And remember,
we're all in this together.

761
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:35,376
We need to look out for each other.

762
00:51:35,513 --> 00:51:37,401
So tell your friends
and tell your neighbors.

763
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:40,691
Let's help each other.
Go on home.

764
00:51:42,745 --> 00:51:45,396
Let's do what he said.
You can pay me later.

765
00:51:46,073 --> 00:51:47,251
Here's something for your boys.

766
00:51:48,569 --> 00:51:50,194
Just go home, everybody. It's okay.

767
00:51:56,538 --> 00:52:00,116
In what experts are calling
a one-in-a-million tragedy,

768
00:52:00,249 --> 00:52:03,119
a meteor has struck down
a passenger plane,

769
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:07,063
killing all passengers and crew.

770
00:52:07,481 --> 00:52:09,423
The real tragedy is
that the aircraft was

771
00:52:09,562 --> 00:52:11,122
struck while trying to land minutes

772
00:52:11,257 --> 00:52:15,218
after the FAA suspended
all air traffic in Northern America

773
00:52:15,386 --> 00:52:17,458
because of the meteor storm
that has turned this

774
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:20,943
into one of the most tragic days
in modern history.

775
00:52:21,082 --> 00:52:22,129
Sir, incoming.

776
00:52:22,265 --> 00:52:24,153
Right over downtown LA.
And it's a big one.

777
00:52:24,281 --> 00:52:25,907
Patch it through to
the ground commander.

778
00:52:35,386 --> 00:52:37,012
Let's go!
Alpha team, you're main effort!

779
00:52:37,146 --> 00:52:38,837
Bravo team,
get ready to shoot if they miss!

780
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:39,636
Let's go!

781
00:52:41,946 --> 00:52:43,801
We're hot! Line 'em up!

782
00:52:54,906 --> 00:52:55,669
They nailed it!

783
00:52:58,554 --> 00:52:59,481
Good shootin', army!

784
00:53:07,162 --> 00:53:09,170
You're a glass-half-empty
kind of guy, aren't you?

785
00:53:10,778 --> 00:53:13,233
We don't have enough missiles
to knock them all down.

786
00:53:13,786 --> 00:53:16,786
The United States arsenal
has a lot of assets.

787
00:53:18,298 --> 00:53:20,370
You better save
most of them for Kassandra,

788
00:53:20,538 --> 00:53:21,913
or we're all dead, no matter what.

789
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:26,609
How low is the trajectory?

790
00:53:26,906 --> 00:53:27,834
Working on it.

791
00:53:39,195 --> 00:53:42,740
How can any man say
this is not the lord's wrath?

792
00:53:43,035 --> 00:53:46,166
Repent now, for the hour of
judgment is at hand!

793
00:53:47,162 --> 00:53:50,229
Oh, I have gazed through a glass
that has shown me the future.

794
00:53:50,330 --> 00:53:52,502
This is the emergency broadcast service.

795
00:53:52,635 --> 00:53:56,017
Stand by for official instructions
from state and federal authorities.

796
00:53:56,155 --> 00:53:57,300
All roads and highways,

797
00:53:57,435 --> 00:53:59,988
including the Eisenhower
interstate highway system,

798
00:54:00,123 --> 00:54:02,294
are closed to all traffic
until further notice,

799
00:54:02,427 --> 00:54:04,118
with the exception of public safety,

800
00:54:04,251 --> 00:54:06,804
emergency medical,
and military vehicles.

801
00:54:06,907 --> 00:54:08,946
All citizens are strongly urged...

802
00:54:31,387 --> 00:54:32,631
Hey, doctor, doctor.

803
00:54:32,955 --> 00:54:34,482
Over here, this way.
Put her in this room.

804
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:36,051
Okay, hurry up.
We're gonna lose him.

805
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,354
Local burns on, uh, extremities.

806
00:54:41,723 --> 00:54:42,770
Get a line in.

807
00:54:43,611 --> 00:54:44,757
Did you check on Michael?

808
00:54:45,979 --> 00:54:47,354
Yeah, his vitals are stable.

809
00:54:47,483 --> 00:54:50,582
Cat scan was negative.
Look, do you want...

810
00:54:50,715 --> 00:54:51,609
No, not right now.

811
00:54:51,739 --> 00:54:55,088
I gotta finish up here.
Michael's stable.

812
00:54:55,356 --> 00:54:57,047
He's luckier than this poor kid.

813
00:55:36,956 --> 00:55:37,938
Now, the shirt.

814
00:55:39,484 --> 00:55:43,062
Please, if I don't get to JPL,
we're all gonna die.

815
00:55:44,732 --> 00:55:47,350
The camiseta! The shirt!

816
00:55:47,612 --> 00:55:50,994
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

817
00:55:51,741 --> 00:55:54,905
Please, please,
you don't have to do this.

818
00:55:56,316 --> 00:55:57,691
Please, please.

819
00:55:58,428 --> 00:56:01,527
Please, don't.
We have to get to shelter.

820
00:56:01,693 --> 00:56:02,587
Now the rest.

821
00:56:04,124 --> 00:56:05,651
Do you wanna die?

822
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:09,942
If I die today,
I will die con un smile in my face.

823
00:56:11,612 --> 00:56:14,100
Screw it. I'll do it myself.

824
00:56:16,924 --> 00:56:18,648
On your knees, now.

825
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,801
Let's go, move up! Go! Go!

826
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:49,908
Tell 'em we're ready to go with 21, go!

827
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:52,249
- Yes, sir!
- Hurry along!

828
00:57:52,605 --> 00:57:53,849
Bring 'er up. Let's see it.

829
00:58:00,254 --> 00:58:01,017
On target!

830
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:03,706
Let's go, come on!

831
00:58:17,534 --> 00:58:19,738
Emergency services have been
stretched to the limit.

832
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:21,852
I can't believe
they made me leave my 'vette.

833
00:58:21,982 --> 00:58:23,029
Squad, fall in.

834
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,403
Shut the hell up about
your damn car already.

835
00:58:27,582 --> 00:58:30,484
Sorry, folks!
We just got word from the shelter.

836
00:58:30,622 --> 00:58:32,029
That's all the room we've got.

837
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:33,179
Oh, god. They can't.

838
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:36,409
That's not right!
You can't just leave us out here!

839
00:58:36,542 --> 00:58:37,371
We're way overcrowded,

840
00:58:37,502 --> 00:58:40,350
and there's plenty of room at
the shelter just over in Carville.

841
00:58:40,478 --> 00:58:44,188
I can't walk 15 miles!
I've got two kids.

842
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:46,169
Please, officer, please.

843
00:58:46,303 --> 00:58:48,474
Come on. Leave it alone.

844
00:58:48,702 --> 00:58:50,710
Sir, sir!

845
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:52,765
Miss, you need to
get back on the truck.

846
00:58:52,894 --> 00:58:55,229
You can let her in.
I'm sure we can squeeze her in.

847
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,814
The shelter is dangerously
overcrowded as it is.

848
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:58,812
Please.

849
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:01,626
Folks, the sooner you get moving,
the sooner you'll get there.

850
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,490
Come on.

851
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:12,660
You get on the truck.
We'll give you our place.

852
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:13,979
Oh, honey, I couldn't.

853
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:16,696
No, we can walk miles.
You can't.

854
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,348
Come on, let's go.

855
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:20,251
What?

856
00:59:20,926 --> 00:59:24,855
Let her on the truck.
My boyfriend and I are leaving.

857
00:59:25,087 --> 00:59:25,981
There are three of them.

858
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,661
It's a baby.

859
00:59:28,927 --> 00:59:30,301
You're being ridiculous.

860
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:33,976
Don't worry, you just go with him.
We'll be fine.

861
00:59:34,431 --> 00:59:36,820
Come on, it's not our fault
that we got here first.

862
00:59:41,471 --> 00:59:44,952
Please, someone,
this lady has kids.

863
00:59:45,183 --> 00:59:46,044
Jenny!

864
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:53,912
You're making a scene.

865
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,694
We'll go.

866
01:00:01,759 --> 01:00:05,054
God bless you. God bless you!

867
01:00:14,591 --> 01:00:15,540
Move out!

868
01:00:16,671 --> 01:00:18,395
Do you think we'll make it
to Carville by nightfall?

869
01:00:18,624 --> 01:00:22,618
Not with the freeway shut down.
We should find someplace to crash.

870
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:26,872
I know somewhere.

871
01:00:27,488 --> 01:00:29,822
- Oh, yeah?
- They've got a hot tub.

872
01:00:51,584 --> 01:00:52,445
Dad, hey.

873
01:00:53,504 --> 01:00:56,155
Oh, thank god. Are you okay?

874
01:01:01,664 --> 01:01:04,250
Mom, come on. It's cool, I'm okay.

875
01:01:04,416 --> 01:01:05,398
Hey.

876
01:01:07,712 --> 01:01:12,284
He's fine. He just...
he just has a minor concussion.

877
01:01:13,568 --> 01:01:15,423
I knew that thick head
was good for something.

878
01:01:15,936 --> 01:01:17,016
Very funny, dad.

879
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:20,889
I'm sorry, Mr. Hapscomb.

880
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:21,756
What's wrong?

881
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:24,927
The supply truck. It didn't come.
No answer in the company.

882
01:01:25,088 --> 01:01:26,615
Oh, crap.

883
01:01:26,912 --> 01:01:27,774
What is it?

884
01:01:27,937 --> 01:01:31,232
Today, of all days, we were supposed to
be restocked on half our meds.

885
01:01:31,392 --> 01:01:32,374
But the truck never showed.

886
01:01:32,768 --> 01:01:34,361
I guess, given everything...

887
01:01:34,593 --> 01:01:37,854
and we're out of really basic stuff,
like penicillin, disinfectant.

888
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:40,156
I already shouldn't be performing
half the procedures I'm doing.

889
01:01:40,288 --> 01:01:41,597
What about the pharmacy?

890
01:01:41,825 --> 01:01:42,839
What do you mean?

891
01:01:43,168 --> 01:01:45,340
Grangers.
Their daughter's in my class.

892
01:01:46,048 --> 01:01:47,510
Wouldn't they have
some of the stuff you need?

893
01:01:47,712 --> 01:01:51,291
Yeah, yeah. I don't know
why I didn't think of that.

894
01:01:51,425 --> 01:01:52,985
Well, you've been busy, honey.

895
01:01:53,089 --> 01:01:53,983
Do you think they're open?

896
01:01:54,465 --> 01:01:56,887
Well, I know Dan Granger.
He'll definitely help out regardless.

897
01:01:57,025 --> 01:01:57,690
Just make a list.

898
01:01:57,825 --> 01:02:02,811
Your father is a genius.
I love you. I love you!

899
01:02:06,337 --> 01:02:07,384
Get a room, people.

900
01:02:11,041 --> 01:02:13,278
You make a list.
I'll go call ahead to the pharmacy.

901
01:02:13,825 --> 01:02:15,102
Get some rest, okay?

902
01:02:17,217 --> 01:02:18,199
You take care of your mom.

903
01:02:46,114 --> 01:02:48,864
Come on. Move!

904
01:02:50,658 --> 01:02:51,356
Damn it!

905
01:03:29,442 --> 01:03:32,192
Stop your vehicle, ma'am.
Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

906
01:03:35,746 --> 01:03:36,542
What's your hurry?

907
01:03:37,378 --> 01:03:39,233
I'm an American citizen, and I'm...

908
01:03:39,362 --> 01:03:40,704
Are you a police officer, ma'am?

909
01:03:40,994 --> 01:03:41,822
No, but...

910
01:03:41,954 --> 01:03:43,328
Step out of the car, please.

911
01:03:43,426 --> 01:03:44,222
You don't understand.

912
01:03:44,386 --> 01:03:45,728
Now, ma'am.

913
01:03:49,762 --> 01:03:51,191
My name is Imogene O'Neill.

914
01:03:51,491 --> 01:03:55,168
And, um, I'm working on
the meteor task force so...

915
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:56,542
There's a gun in the car.

916
01:03:56,674 --> 01:03:57,056
What?

917
01:03:57,186 --> 01:03:58,332
She's got a firearm, Johnny!

918
01:03:58,467 --> 01:03:59,961
No, no, no. That is not my gun.

919
01:04:00,098 --> 01:04:02,848
Would you turn around
and face the vehicle, please?

920
01:04:03,778 --> 01:04:05,917
Turn around,
face the vehicle, please.

921
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:06,366
But...

922
01:04:06,499 --> 01:04:09,598
Face the vehicle. Put your hands out.
Spread your legs.

923
01:04:09,731 --> 01:04:12,251
Please, I have to get to a phone.

924
01:04:12,418 --> 01:04:14,207
I have coordinates
that Dr. Chetwyn-

925
01:04:14,338 --> 01:04:17,240
the government needs to
shoot down the asteroid.

926
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:21,378
All right, she's clean.
May I see your passport, please?

927
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:26,077
Yes, of course.
Damn it. My jacket.

928
01:04:26,307 --> 01:04:28,795
My jacket, I left my jacket
back at the police station.

929
01:04:29,187 --> 01:04:33,148
I see. Why are you driving
a Mexican police car.

930
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:38,905
Because I was... I was attacked.
By these two men.

931
01:04:39,171 --> 01:04:42,400
And... and they killed these
two officers back at the police station.

932
01:04:42,691 --> 01:04:44,960
All right, uh, you're gonna
have to come with me, please.

933
01:04:45,091 --> 01:04:47,426
No, you're not listening to
me here, okay?!

934
01:04:47,555 --> 01:04:48,733
We don't have time!

935
01:04:48,867 --> 01:04:51,201
Then we'd better get
this sorted out quickly.

936
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:33,882
We're getting slammed.

937
01:05:34,468 --> 01:05:36,323
The frequency of the rocks coming
through the atmosphere is increasing,

938
01:05:36,451 --> 01:05:37,117
and they're getting bigger.

939
01:05:37,251 --> 01:05:38,560
The hits are measuring
on the Richter scale

940
01:05:39,171 --> 01:05:40,284
and we're starting to miss.

941
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:42,620
Christ. Casualty count?

942
01:05:42,852 --> 01:05:43,615
It's over a thousand.

943
01:05:44,196 --> 01:05:46,465
Sir, we got two monsters
heading for Huntsville, New York,

944
01:05:46,596 --> 01:05:47,774
and no patriot missiles in range.

945
01:05:47,908 --> 01:05:48,257
Population?

946
01:05:48,388 --> 01:05:49,948
17,000. I grew up a couple
towns from there.

947
01:05:50,084 --> 01:05:52,572
I got a sub off the coast.
Saab missiles will vaporize this.

948
01:05:52,708 --> 01:05:53,504
Wait, wait, wait... once again,

949
01:05:53,636 --> 01:05:55,970
we can't afford to
waste the big missiles.

950
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:58,042
We gotta save everything
we got for kassandra herself!

951
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:00,667
So, what, we're just supposed to
let 17,000 people die?

952
01:06:00,804 --> 01:06:01,752
I don't know!

953
01:06:01,892 --> 01:06:03,102
But what good is saving 70,000

954
01:06:03,236 --> 01:06:04,697
you lose the whole planet
in the morning?!

955
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:06,527
So aren't most people
in shelters by now?

956
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:07,772
Some... it's taking time.

957
01:06:07,908 --> 01:06:10,330
Sir, I have two more heading for towns
in North Dakota and Minnesota.

958
01:06:10,468 --> 01:06:11,930
Same scenario... out of patriot range.

959
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:12,831
All right, general, you cannot...

960
01:06:12,964 --> 01:06:13,979
Enough!

961
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:16,608
The next thing I want to hear
from you are the coordinates for

962
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:20,515
where to hit the asteroid.
I'm sorry.

963
01:06:20,645 --> 01:06:24,256
But I will not sacrifice
all these people.

964
01:06:26,788 --> 01:06:29,920
Take whatever you need,
knock down anything you can.

965
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:32,735
You heard the man...
all subs, all silos, spit 'em up!

966
01:07:06,341 --> 01:07:09,024
To determine...

967
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:15,482
Keep movin'.
Take the stairway to the right.

968
01:07:15,621 --> 01:07:17,444
There's food and water down there.
You'll be safe.

969
01:07:17,765 --> 01:07:18,910
I got these from Myrna at the motel.

970
01:07:19,045 --> 01:07:20,801
Good work. Get 'em down there.
We're filling up fast.

971
01:07:20,933 --> 01:07:21,565
You got it.

972
01:07:25,573 --> 01:07:26,402
Uh, here.

973
01:07:29,957 --> 01:07:30,885
Here you go, ma'am.

974
01:07:33,285 --> 01:07:34,692
First stairway to the right,
sweetheart.

975
01:07:34,789 --> 01:07:35,552
Chief, he's got a gun!

976
01:07:35,909 --> 01:07:38,757
You think you can sucker punch me
and get away with it, old man?

977
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:41,570
No sir! You do not disrespect me.

978
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:47,707
Son... it may seem to you like you
have the drop on me,

979
01:07:48,518 --> 01:07:50,689
but I can assure you,
it only seems that way.

980
01:07:51,846 --> 01:07:53,537
Don't forget, I do this for a living.

981
01:07:54,853 --> 01:07:56,544
So I can guarantee you this.

982
01:07:57,029 --> 01:08:01,764
First, I will disarm you,
and then I will shoot you dead.

983
01:08:03,429 --> 01:08:04,891
You don't want that, now, do you?

984
01:08:10,246 --> 01:08:10,977
Do you?

985
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:17,179
You want respect, Dwight?

986
01:08:18,566 --> 01:08:19,646
You got to earn it.

987
01:08:24,805 --> 01:08:28,799
Well, there's your chance.
That sound... that's our challenge.

988
01:08:28,934 --> 01:08:31,039
That's the good lord
throwin' down his gauntlet,

989
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:33,725
askin' us who we are
and what we're made of.

990
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:39,745
He wants to know what we're capable
of doing in the face of adversity.

991
01:08:40,038 --> 01:08:42,591
Whether we'll stick together,
or whether we'll just fall apart.

992
01:08:43,814 --> 01:08:46,203
Now, all of us could be
dead here in a split second.

993
01:08:46,406 --> 01:08:49,635
But before we go,
we each of us have to answer the call.

994
01:08:51,398 --> 01:08:52,642
What's your answer, Dwight?

995
01:08:58,726 --> 01:08:59,457
How can I help?

996
01:09:05,927 --> 01:09:06,854
You made the right choice.

997
01:09:07,847 --> 01:09:09,854
Lots of people downstairs
need help getting set up.

998
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:36,929
I called your father myself,
still no answer.

999
01:09:38,855 --> 01:09:42,652
I'm sorry. Try to get some rest, okay?
The two of you.

1000
01:09:54,471 --> 01:09:56,064
My mom's a really good doctor.

1001
01:09:57,031 --> 01:09:59,813
She's gonna fix him up. You'll see.

1002
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,400
TV just went out. God.

1003
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:09,601
- Mom? Mom! Mom!
- I apologize.

1004
01:10:09,735 --> 01:10:13,314
We are experiencing technical...
technical difficulties.

1005
01:10:13,447 --> 01:10:14,789
Again, federal off...

1006
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:18,116
are advising every...
to get to a shelter.

1007
01:10:28,999 --> 01:10:29,860
Maya...

1008
01:10:32,872 --> 01:10:34,694
Ohh... Mr. Crowe?

1009
01:10:35,048 --> 01:10:36,903
I didn't mean to scare you.
Where's jenny?

1010
01:10:37,064 --> 01:10:40,992
Uh, she went to the cabin
for the weekend with Jeff.

1011
01:10:42,087 --> 01:10:43,581
I just gave the address to
your partner.

1012
01:10:44,488 --> 01:10:46,343
Calvin was here already?

1013
01:10:47,272 --> 01:10:48,254
How long ago?

1014
01:10:48,392 --> 01:10:51,010
Uh... half an hour ago?

1015
01:10:51,112 --> 01:10:52,454
And you told him where she was?

1016
01:10:52,776 --> 01:10:53,856
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1017
01:10:53,992 --> 01:10:56,807
He said you had your hands full
and you asked him to get her home,

1018
01:10:56,935 --> 01:11:01,092
what with the meteors and all.
Doesn't he work with you?

1019
01:11:01,287 --> 01:11:04,964
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.
Um... do you have the address?

1020
01:11:05,096 --> 01:11:06,787
Uh... here.

1021
01:11:13,544 --> 01:11:17,319
All right, thanks.
Shouldn't you been to the shelter?

1022
01:11:17,576 --> 01:11:18,405
I'm on my way.

1023
01:11:19,272 --> 01:11:20,646
All right, well, get a move on.

1024
01:11:55,593 --> 01:11:56,291
Oh, my god.

1025
01:11:58,825 --> 01:12:01,792
Ah, we are now officially out of meds.

1026
01:12:07,753 --> 01:12:12,259
Okay. Okay, move! Everybody out!
Everybody out! Out, out!

1027
01:12:23,817 --> 01:12:25,377
Thanks for the help, pal.

1028
01:12:27,081 --> 01:12:28,029
I really mean it.

1029
01:12:29,289 --> 01:12:30,816
It was good of you
to help a brother out.

1030
01:12:35,401 --> 01:12:36,263
You're a good man.

1031
01:13:11,593 --> 01:13:13,284
Are you people gonna
come talk to me!

1032
01:13:21,001 --> 01:13:22,114
You got quite a temper.

1033
01:13:24,137 --> 01:13:26,985
We're all gonna die...
unless you talk to me.

1034
01:13:27,113 --> 01:13:31,042
I've been doing this job for years.
First time I ever heard that.

1035
01:13:31,466 --> 01:13:33,288
I am a scientist. I am working...

1036
01:13:33,417 --> 01:13:34,824
Just hold on, ma'am.

1037
01:13:36,234 --> 01:13:40,904
They say one of them meteors hit
some computer routing thing in Nevada.

1038
01:13:41,705 --> 01:13:43,461
So we got no internet at all.

1039
01:13:44,138 --> 01:13:46,439
I can't check your identity
until we're up and running.

1040
01:13:49,322 --> 01:13:50,271
Do you know what happens

1041
01:13:50,442 --> 01:13:53,759
when a class-one asteroid
hits a class-one comet?

1042
01:13:54,442 --> 01:13:55,107
No, ma'am.

1043
01:13:55,178 --> 01:13:56,553
It gets knocked off course.

1044
01:13:56,970 --> 01:14:02,633
Its trajectory becomes unknowable.
Unless you know exactly how to look.

1045
01:14:05,547 --> 01:14:06,921
And when it hits the earth...

1046
01:14:11,146 --> 01:14:13,121
We all go home to the good lord.

1047
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:17,731
You're a man of faith.

1048
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:23,145
Look me in the eye
and tell me I'm lying.

1049
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:25,888
Now you're playing me, miss.

1050
01:14:30,282 --> 01:14:33,381
Wait! Wait.
Lock me up, put me in a cell.

1051
01:14:33,514 --> 01:14:34,921
Keep me here forever.
I don't care!

1052
01:14:35,530 --> 01:14:37,156
Just call Jet Propulsion laboratories.

1053
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:39,657
Tell them that you have
Daniel Lehman's computer.

1054
01:14:39,787 --> 01:14:42,754
You have the asymmetrical
trajectory algorithm.

1055
01:14:42,891 --> 01:14:46,721
I will write this down for you.
Please, we're running out of time.

1056
01:14:49,323 --> 01:14:52,389
I'll tell you what.
I'll get you a phone.

1057
01:14:53,227 --> 01:14:54,154
Thank you!

1058
01:14:54,603 --> 01:14:56,032
You're really scared, aren't you?

1059
01:14:57,355 --> 01:14:58,881
I'm terrified.

1060
01:15:03,403 --> 01:15:04,232
Come on.

1061
01:15:09,323 --> 01:15:10,086
Just take her out that way.

1062
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:11,616
Okay, thank God.

1063
01:15:13,195 --> 01:15:15,300
Where are you going?
Yeah, second floor is as stable.

1064
01:15:15,435 --> 01:15:16,515
No, I have to get my son.

1065
01:15:43,404 --> 01:15:44,745
The damage was not confined to

1066
01:15:44,876 --> 01:15:47,843
the actual impact area
as this spectacular point...

1067
01:15:47,979 --> 01:15:50,281
I calculated the most
likely course for Cassandra,

1068
01:15:51,084 --> 01:15:53,189
I had flying shots
but then no shots at all.

1069
01:15:53,612 --> 01:15:55,106
It started in the early morning hours

1070
01:15:55,244 --> 01:15:58,211
just after the San Clemente strike,
firemen...

1071
01:15:58,347 --> 01:16:01,381
We have about an
11 minute window, 13 tops.

1072
01:16:01,644 --> 01:16:03,237
She's about to enter the atmosphere

1073
01:16:03,372 --> 01:16:04,998
and as you know
we'll have it if we hit her too low.

1074
01:16:05,644 --> 01:16:07,499
The plug is in, watch in five minutes.

1075
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,227
Mr. President? We're launched.

1076
01:16:12,331 --> 01:16:14,917
Dr. Chetwyn, there's an image
in the AOL in 19-30.

1077
01:16:15,084 --> 01:16:15,651
Wait.

1078
01:16:16,044 --> 01:16:17,866
Excuse me, Mr. President, what?

1079
01:16:17,996 --> 01:16:20,417
It's Lehman's assistant,
she may have an update.

1080
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:23,172
Imogene.

1081
01:16:23,308 --> 01:16:24,901
I'm running
the A-symmetrical algorithm

1082
01:16:25,036 --> 01:16:26,443
on Cassandra's trajectory.

1083
01:16:26,604 --> 01:16:27,782
I know, I know.
I've been running them all day.

1084
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,323
The 3-D analytics don't hold up.

1085
01:16:29,452 --> 01:16:31,208
These are big numbers,
they are going off the chart.

1086
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:32,965
That's what Dr. Lehman
was trying to tell you.

1087
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:34,180
He revised the algorithm.

1088
01:16:34,316 --> 01:16:35,210
I've been trying to get this

1089
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,228
so you could plug it
into your mainframe.

1090
01:16:37,516 --> 01:16:38,182
Imogene.

1091
01:16:38,316 --> 01:16:39,745
But we're going to
have to rely on the laptop.

1092
01:16:39,884 --> 01:16:41,794
I've used
a much smaller settling ratio.

1093
01:16:41,933 --> 01:16:43,394
No, no, we're waiting to launch.

1094
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:44,994
Will you just give me five minutes?

1095
01:16:45,132 --> 01:16:47,205
I need the trajectory now.

1096
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:49,380
It's been hours since Dr. Lehman...

1097
01:16:50,188 --> 01:16:51,049
At last we have the numbers.

1098
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:52,838
Am I holding the launch?

1099
01:16:53,389 --> 01:16:56,236
- Imogene, now, now.
- We're going in two minutes.

1100
01:16:56,364 --> 01:16:59,048
Okay, here we go, here we go.

1101
01:17:00,525 --> 01:17:00,939
I got it.

1102
01:17:01,069 --> 01:17:02,181
Hold on, hold the launch,
hold the launch.

1103
01:17:02,316 --> 01:17:03,461
Oh, c'mon, general?

1104
01:17:03,597 --> 01:17:04,873
I got the trajectory.

1105
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,148
Imogene, I'm putting you
on the speaker phone.

1106
01:17:06,285 --> 01:17:08,325
Give me the trajectories now, go, go.

1107
01:17:09,165 --> 01:17:16,618
Cassandra's trajectories is from
5-17-46 descending to 0-2-20-0-6.

1108
01:17:16,748 --> 01:17:17,828
I repeat, it's got it.

1109
01:17:17,964 --> 01:17:19,426
Sir, do I reprogram the launch?

1110
01:17:20,652 --> 01:17:21,863
How sure are you of these numbers?

1111
01:17:21,997 --> 01:17:24,680
I am more sure than of
anything else we've got.

1112
01:17:24,780 --> 01:17:25,925
Dan Lehman was a genius.

1113
01:17:26,061 --> 01:17:27,970
Who you fired
because he was crazy.

1114
01:17:28,237 --> 01:17:28,706
Sir?

1115
01:17:29,293 --> 01:17:31,081
Reprogram in the new numbers.

1116
01:17:31,949 --> 01:17:34,535
Hit it hard, to try to kill her.

1117
01:17:34,636 --> 01:17:35,171
Thank you, miss.

1118
01:17:35,309 --> 01:17:37,000
I think we're quite clear
on that vine now.

1119
01:17:37,357 --> 01:17:40,292
Mr. President, we're launched, go.

1120
01:17:40,429 --> 01:17:49,475
New coordinates, reset the clocks.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

1121
01:17:49,613 --> 01:17:51,304
We'll never get too level,
get the paramedics ready,

1122
01:17:51,437 --> 01:17:52,866
there's going to be debris
and a lot of it.

1123
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:57,989
Three, two, one, launch.

1124
01:18:14,733 --> 01:18:15,562
The birds are away.

1125
01:18:16,621 --> 01:18:18,563
They're still on radar blank,
how do we know if we hit it?

1126
01:18:19,021 --> 01:18:20,134
It would fall on our heads, we'd know.

1127
01:18:20,589 --> 01:18:22,761
Get the missile near to the bunk right
ahead to Edwards Air Force Base,

1128
01:18:22,861 --> 01:18:24,268
I need her on a secure hard line.

1129
01:18:24,365 --> 01:18:26,787
Don't fly her,
there's going to be a ton of debris.

1130
01:18:26,893 --> 01:18:28,803
Ground all the flights, military too.

1131
01:18:29,902 --> 01:18:31,658
Let's do it, ground all flights.

1132
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:34,444
Get missile near at Edwards,
use any means necessary.

1133
01:18:34,573 --> 01:18:35,467
Yes, sir.

1134
01:18:38,413 --> 01:18:39,275
Oh, thank you.

1135
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:49,833
What's wrong?

1136
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:51,140
You know I'm not sure.

1137
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:59,141
I was extrapolating Dr. Lehman's formula
and the assumption is not right.

1138
01:19:10,254 --> 01:19:11,683
One minute to intercept.

1139
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:16,234
Murphy, sir?

1140
01:19:17,678 --> 01:19:18,539
Yes, sir.

1141
01:19:19,982 --> 01:19:21,159
She's right here.

1142
01:19:22,574 --> 01:19:23,435
Of course, sir.

1143
01:19:24,846 --> 01:19:26,155
Thank you, sir.

1144
01:19:27,694 --> 01:19:29,156
That was the Vice-President?

1145
01:19:29,358 --> 01:19:30,057
Of what?

1146
01:19:30,254 --> 01:19:32,359
The Vice-President of the United States.

1147
01:19:32,846 --> 01:19:35,432
They need you at
Edwards Air Force Base ASAP.

1148
01:19:35,566 --> 01:19:36,428
Okay, hang on.

1149
01:19:36,558 --> 01:19:37,670
Can you do that in the car?

1150
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:38,824
Yeah, yeah.

1151
01:19:38,958 --> 01:19:39,755
Well, let's go.

1152
01:19:39,887 --> 01:19:41,131
I want to take you there myself.

1153
01:19:41,262 --> 01:19:43,302
It's not everyday you
get a call like that.

1154
01:20:11,726 --> 01:20:12,654
We have contact.

1155
01:20:13,071 --> 01:20:13,769
Status?

1156
01:20:14,606 --> 01:20:15,817
Standby,

1157
01:20:25,455 --> 01:20:26,404
target reduced.

1158
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:34,246
Keep the Patriot and Nessus on standby.

1159
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:35,275
It came through

1160
01:20:36,111 --> 01:20:37,606
The missiles on standby.

1161
01:20:39,056 --> 01:20:39,983
Aye.

1162
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:20,528
Hey.

1163
01:22:25,232 --> 01:22:29,837
That was way too easy, buddy boy.
You're not much of a cop.

1164
01:22:30,032 --> 01:22:31,920
Let her go. Let her go, Cal.

1165
01:22:32,048 --> 01:22:34,798
Oh, you're a funny man,
put the gun down.

1166
01:22:35,376 --> 01:22:38,311
Put it down or I'll spread her
all over the damn room.

1167
01:22:38,449 --> 01:22:39,464
Put it down.

1168
01:22:41,361 --> 01:22:46,150
Atta, boy, nice and easy.
Kick it over to me now.

1169
01:22:54,161 --> 01:22:59,977
On your knees now, get down on
your knees, that's a good boy.

1170
01:23:04,497 --> 01:23:07,563
Just take me and let her go.

1171
01:23:08,113 --> 01:23:13,131
Oh, that's just touching.
But you're missing the point.

1172
01:23:14,545 --> 01:23:19,182
I want you to feel what I feel,
my pain.

1173
01:23:19,313 --> 01:23:20,808
Cal, goddamit, I feel it.

1174
01:23:20,945 --> 01:23:24,654
You don't know my pain. But you will.

1175
01:23:24,785 --> 01:23:25,646
No.

1176
01:23:33,618 --> 01:23:35,211
Now, that's some fireworks.

1177
01:23:37,906 --> 01:23:38,767
Oh, god.

1178
01:23:39,089 --> 01:23:40,299
Beautiful, huh.

1179
01:23:41,554 --> 01:23:46,824
So, those things are going to land.
We got to find cover, now.

1180
01:23:55,890 --> 01:23:58,792
Run, get inside.

1181
01:24:05,522 --> 01:24:09,100
Michael? Michael?

1182
01:24:16,146 --> 01:24:19,659
Michael?
It's mommy, can you hear me?

1183
01:24:38,066 --> 01:24:39,081
Backstairs.

1184
01:24:57,747 --> 01:25:00,714
Oh, god, Michael.

1185
01:25:46,099 --> 01:25:51,467
Chelsea, Michael, can you hear me?

1186
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:01,929
Chelsea.

1187
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,067
Look at the bright side,
you did it, you saved us.

1188
01:26:36,644 --> 01:26:39,620
No, I didn't, you should
have seen us a lot sooner.

1189
01:26:42,164 --> 01:26:43,028
What's wrong?

1190
01:26:43,545 --> 01:26:48,031
The asteroid, it should be reaching us
a lot later and somewhere in Europe.

1191
01:26:48,198 --> 01:26:50,594
Everything is off
from the mass estimate.

1192
01:26:51,087 --> 01:26:52,618
I'm sorry I 'm not following.

1193
01:26:53,173 --> 01:26:56,216
Right there, wrong assumption
right from the start,

1194
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:59,458
Dr. Lehman miscalculated
the asteroid's mass.

1195
01:27:00,652 --> 01:27:02,698
The original comet
hit Cassandra already

1196
01:27:02,834 --> 01:27:04,749
but it didn't just
send it toward the earth.

1197
01:27:05,145 --> 01:27:05,878
Okay.

1198
01:27:06,011 --> 01:27:08,320
The original impact splintered in two.

1199
01:27:09,253 --> 01:27:10,149
So?

1200
01:27:11,756 --> 01:27:13,036
So, it's not over.

1201
01:27:14,356 --> 01:27:16,949
The second half of Cassandra
is still coming.

1202
01:27:19,780 --> 01:27:20,928
I think she's bigger.

1203
01:27:23,984 --> 01:27:28,733
We're the only ones who know.
We have to call them now.

1204
01:27:42,503 --> 01:27:43,816
Grab the brakes.
