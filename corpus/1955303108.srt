1
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:21,378
Lie next to me, Josh.

2
00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:25,611
Come on, Manny.

3
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:26,512
Lie down.

4
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:27,478
It's peaceful here.

5
00:01:27,578 --> 00:01:28,678
Yeah.

6
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:34,412
Kids, this isn't funny.

7
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:37,010
Sure it is.

8
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:38,911
How could you possibly
think this is funny?

9
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:39,876
Come on, Dad.

10
00:01:39,977 --> 00:01:40,743
It's one of those things.

11
00:01:40,844 --> 00:01:42,777
You know?

12
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:44,543
It's kind of funny.

13
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:45,743
Kind of sick.

14
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:51,411
Come on.

15
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,378
Isn't it funny?

16
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:55,677
Us lying next to our
dead big sister?

17
00:01:55,778 --> 00:01:57,812
Like a family portrait?

18
00:01:57,911 --> 00:01:59,210
And this is how you
pay respects?

19
00:02:01,944 --> 00:02:03,109
Well, this is bullshit.

20
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:04,310
I'll be in the car.

21
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:06,677
You want to know what's
really bullshit?

22
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:10,076
The fact that we might
as well all be dead.

23
00:02:10,176 --> 00:02:12,176
Was she all that mattered
to you, Dad?

24
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:33,442
Mom and Dad know you drink.

25
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:36,075
They can smell it on your
breath, you know?

26
00:02:36,175 --> 00:02:37,509
Not that they care.

27
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,643
Are you gonna smoke weed?

28
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:44,875
Just remember all the brain
cells you're killing.

29
00:02:48,275 --> 00:02:50,474
So how do I look?

30
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:51,774
Adorable.

31
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,040
Adorable?

32
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:54,441
Adorable.

33
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:58,774
Or not.

34
00:02:58,875 --> 00:02:59,508
Hold on.

35
00:02:59,608 --> 00:03:00,575
I gotta pee.

36
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:14,939
Sam.

37
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:17,040
Sam?

38
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,573
I wish you could come with me.

39
00:03:22,606 --> 00:03:24,407
Samantha?

40
00:03:53,573 --> 00:03:55,638
I've been looking
for you.

41
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:57,239
I gotta get out of here.

42
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:57,805
No.

43
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:58,639
Come on, Josh.

44
00:03:58,739 --> 00:03:59,771
Please?

45
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,638
The guys here are
total losers.

46
00:04:00,737 --> 00:04:02,604
Come dance with me.

47
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:03,039
Come on.

48
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:03,737
Fine.

49
00:04:03,838 --> 00:04:04,572
Come on.

50
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:06,004
You're my brother.

51
00:04:06,104 --> 00:04:07,405
Manny.

52
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,136
Hamlet and the gravedigger talk
about the brevity of life

53
00:05:00,235 --> 00:05:03,868
and death as the great
equalizer.

54
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:07,235
And it's interesting that this
scene is so often cut from

55
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:09,767
productions, because it's
crucial to Hamlet's story.

56
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:10,534
Wouldn't you agree?

57
00:05:10,636 --> 00:05:11,769
All right.

58
00:05:11,869 --> 00:05:16,402
Now remember, in the beginning,
Hamlet is so afraid

59
00:05:16,502 --> 00:05:19,935
of his father's ghost and the
prospect of his own death.

60
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:24,102
And now he's playing with
Yorick's skull.

61
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:27,934
That's kind of a quick
turnaround, don't you think?

62
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:32,901
He's beginning to accept death
as an inevitable part of life.

63
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:36,901
Now, the audience knows that
Ophelia's dead, which is an

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,666
example of?

65
00:05:37,766 --> 00:05:38,733
Dramatic irony.

66
00:05:38,834 --> 00:05:39,867
Dramatic irony.

67
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:40,832
Right.

68
00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:42,367
Because Hamlet is unaware.

69
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:45,600
Now, there's also a lot of
mystery surrounding the cause

70
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:47,267
of Ophelia's death.

71
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:51,533
Gertrude describes it as an
accident, but the priest

72
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:56,667
argues that her death was
doubtful, and denies her full

73
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:57,933
burial rites by the church.

74
00:05:58,033 --> 00:05:59,432
Now, why would they do that?

75
00:05:59,533 --> 00:05:59,833
Any thoughts?

76
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:00,600
Yes?

77
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:01,500
Bathroom?

78
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:04,500
Fine.

79
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,066
Any other thoughts?

80
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,399
Anyone at all?

81
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:20,064
Amanda, you are so demented.

82
00:06:20,165 --> 00:06:21,632
I am so out of here.

83
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:22,998
You coming?

84
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:24,399
I guess.

85
00:06:28,031 --> 00:06:29,531
Why are we ditching
Mr. Evans' class?

86
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,930
He's so hot.

87
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:31,897
Come on.

88
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:32,997
I'll be your best friend.

89
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:34,732
You already are.

90
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:35,897
Katie, Katie, Katie.

91
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:36,831
I know.

92
00:06:36,932 --> 00:06:37,931
Let's get some coffee.

93
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,331
Now.

94
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:43,663
Are your parents
gonna be home tonight?

95
00:06:43,764 --> 00:06:44,865
No.

96
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:16,396
That's nice.

97
00:07:24,096 --> 00:07:26,161
Cutie.

98
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:29,329
Take my picture.

99
00:07:29,428 --> 00:07:30,762
Come on.

100
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,161
OK.

101
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:38,162
That's a good one, Sam.

102
00:08:33,393 --> 00:08:34,860
Would you stop doing that?

103
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,258
It's creepy.

104
00:08:47,692 --> 00:08:49,793
Ryan is the highest
boy at Stephens'.

105
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:51,658
And also the biggest
douche bag.

106
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:53,325
How do you even like Ryan?

107
00:08:53,426 --> 00:08:53,959
Come on.

108
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:56,258
Ben likes him.

109
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:58,725
He just doesn't have a
very good reputation.

110
00:08:58,826 --> 00:09:01,091
Why should you be the only
girl with a boyfriend?

111
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:02,891
You and Ben are legit
chained at the hip.

112
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,624
Ben and I aren't
the issue here.

113
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:08,824
Katie, I don't understand
where your problem is.

114
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,224
Whatever.

115
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:26,956
Your brother's a freak.

116
00:09:27,057 --> 00:09:28,490
Hey, Katie.

117
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,790
Hey, Josh.

118
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:32,191
Afternoon, ladies.

119
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,256
Either I join, or you
guys are so busted.

120
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:39,722
Like Mom and Dad give a shit.

121
00:09:59,355 --> 00:10:03,422
God, she looks just
like Samantha.

122
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:06,422
Smile, Manny.

123
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:07,122
Creep.

124
00:10:07,221 --> 00:10:08,821
Yeah, that's classy.

125
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:10,389
Full of class.

126
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:11,588
That's me.

127
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:19,189
Yeah.

128
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,555
Ryan here.

129
00:10:38,053 --> 00:10:40,419
Hey, Katie.

130
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,620
Why don't you kiss my brother?

131
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:45,552
Why?

132
00:10:45,653 --> 00:10:47,120
Because I said so?

133
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,519
Get in there.

134
00:11:14,985 --> 00:11:18,052
Is she a good kisser, Josh?

135
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:19,019
See for yourself.

136
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:20,418
Right.

137
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:31,651
Nice.

138
00:11:34,918 --> 00:11:36,217
Nice.

139
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:40,783
You are such a typical guy.

140
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:43,384
Totally.

141
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:44,584
Come on.

142
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:51,016
I love you guys.

143
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:52,550
You can do it.

144
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:52,983
What?

145
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:53,883
What?

146
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:56,349
Do it.

147
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:56,783
Shut up.

148
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,117
What?

149
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,216
You are such a perv!

150
00:12:06,317 --> 00:12:07,615
You're the perv.

151
00:12:13,515 --> 00:12:15,415
Gross.

152
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:16,817
God.

153
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,215
Katie.

154
00:12:18,316 --> 00:12:20,816
Why don't you just finish
what you started?

155
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:44,481
This is Mrs. Kildoff
from attendance.

156
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:46,980
Amanda left school early today,
and we need you to call

157
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:47,615
as soon as...

158
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:03,247
Morning, kids.

159
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:04,246
Good morning, Dad.

160
00:13:04,346 --> 00:13:05,614
Good morning, Mr. Anderson.

161
00:13:05,712 --> 00:13:06,813
I'll be late.

162
00:14:03,077 --> 00:14:04,877
We should just start,
like, a little, like,

163
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,443
log of shit, right?

164
00:14:06,543 --> 00:14:08,811
Just like, like a book with
like, every day we have like,

165
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:09,711
one solid idea.

166
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:10,612
Yeah.

167
00:14:10,711 --> 00:14:11,511
So let's just start.

168
00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:12,009
OK.

169
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,311
All right.

170
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,443
You can't make art without
starting, right?

171
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:15,843
No, not at all.

172
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:17,243
All right, let's just
fucking start.

173
00:14:17,344 --> 00:14:17,843
Yeah, fucking
let's start, man.

174
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:18,843
OK.

175
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:19,876
All right.

176
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:20,876
Out loud, or write them down?

177
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:21,475
Out loud.

178
00:14:21,576 --> 00:14:22,844
OK.

179
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:24,409
Who starts?

180
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:31,175
A store full of mannequins comes
alive after hours, and

181
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:32,309
they sing and dance.

182
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:33,909
Well, that sounds
like a musical.

183
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:35,309
No, no.

184
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:36,574
They'd be like mannequins
in the Korova Milk Bar.

185
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:37,776
Remember?

186
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,475
Singing and drinking
Milk Plus.

187
00:14:40,576 --> 00:14:41,676
To sharpen you up.

188
00:14:41,775 --> 00:14:45,875
Get you ready for a bit of
the old ultra violence.

189
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:46,942
Sounds big budget.

190
00:14:47,043 --> 00:14:48,842
It's cool though, right?

191
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:50,975
Less than 10
minutes, right?

192
00:14:51,076 --> 00:14:51,576
Yeah.

193
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:52,543
Go.

194
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:03,075
Yo, yo, hold on a sec, J!

195
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,941
Hey, they're throwing a
party for Mickey, and

196
00:15:27,041 --> 00:15:28,607
Ryan wants me to come.

197
00:15:28,706 --> 00:15:29,874
He so wants you.

198
00:15:29,974 --> 00:15:32,474
Yes!

199
00:15:32,573 --> 00:15:35,740
A son tells his parents he
wants a sex change operation.

200
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,374
OK.

201
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:37,708
Wait.

202
00:15:37,807 --> 00:15:41,340
The the father is this, this
bull matron sort of macho

203
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,040
prick, and he's got no short
term memory, so the one has to

204
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,240
keep telling him
over and over.

205
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,940
Great Santini meets Memento?

206
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,106
Meets Brokeback Mountain.

207
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:49,005
Yo, that's dope, dude.

208
00:15:58,405 --> 00:15:59,271
There's a party tonight.

209
00:15:59,371 --> 00:16:00,740
Amanda says we should go.

210
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:01,839
Not me.

211
00:16:01,938 --> 00:16:03,238
Yeah, you.

212
00:16:07,306 --> 00:16:09,139
Josh, how are we gonna
collaborate next year with you

213
00:16:09,239 --> 00:16:12,272
in LA and me stuck
here in the city?

214
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,371
Dude.

215
00:16:13,471 --> 00:16:15,572
We write all year and
shoot in the summer.

216
00:16:15,672 --> 00:16:16,772
It's simple.

217
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:28,903
We said we'd go to
the same school.

218
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:32,605
Did I ask you to
get rejected?

219
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:34,971
Where's your pot?

220
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,370
In the closet.

221
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,538
It's gonna get pretty boring
if you keep it on me.

222
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,104
Well, maybe
tonight you'll finally get

223
00:16:47,203 --> 00:16:49,569
some, and I'm gonna
document it.

224
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:50,203
Yeah.

225
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:51,237
Loser gets lucky.

226
00:16:51,337 --> 00:16:52,002
Nice.

227
00:16:52,102 --> 00:16:52,902
High concept.

228
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:53,802
Give it to me.

229
00:16:53,903 --> 00:16:54,704
I wanna shoot.

230
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:55,470
Why?

231
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,171
Give it to me.

232
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:56,769
No.

233
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,536
No.

234
00:16:57,635 --> 00:16:58,903
Fuck you, then.

235
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:00,503
All right.

236
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,135
Dude, come on.

237
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:03,537
You can do it!

238
00:17:08,603 --> 00:17:09,701
I will be the star.

239
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:18,536
Welcome to the lifestyles of
the rich and obnoxious.

240
00:17:27,134 --> 00:17:29,335
Join us as we experience
their champagne

241
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:32,967
wishes and cocaine dreams.

242
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:41,201
Yo, dude.

243
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:41,835
Get some of this.

244
00:17:41,934 --> 00:17:42,768
Come on.

245
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:09,866
Josh.

246
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,465
Ryan's barely even
said hi to me.

247
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:13,865
Well at least I guess Tom
got in your throat first thing

248
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:15,032
we got here.

249
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:15,865
Dance with Seth.

250
00:18:15,965 --> 00:18:17,199
Make him jealous.

251
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,032
Hi, Seth.

252
00:18:19,134 --> 00:18:20,531
Didn't wear my dancing
shoes tonight, Manny.

253
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,598
Hi, Seth.

254
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:22,432
Hey, Katie.

255
00:18:22,532 --> 00:18:23,065
Where's Ben?

256
00:18:23,165 --> 00:18:24,598
In the bathroom.

257
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,866
With Ryan.

258
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:27,033
What are you implying?

259
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:27,999
Hey, yo!

260
00:18:28,097 --> 00:18:28,865
Yo, everybody!

261
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:29,731
Everyone, listen up!

262
00:18:29,832 --> 00:18:30,965
Listen... listen up.

263
00:18:31,065 --> 00:18:31,965
Where's Mickey?

264
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:33,565
Where's Mickey?

265
00:18:43,598 --> 00:18:43,932
Come on.

266
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,731
What do you give
a guy that has

267
00:18:51,832 --> 00:18:56,532
everything on his 18th birthday?

268
00:18:56,632 --> 00:18:57,097
What?

269
00:18:57,198 --> 00:18:58,232
I don't know!

270
00:18:58,332 --> 00:18:59,764
What do you give him?

271
00:18:59,864 --> 00:19:00,896
That's the question.

272
00:19:00,997 --> 00:19:05,598
The answer is you don't.

273
00:19:05,698 --> 00:19:07,132
You don't get anything.

274
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:13,730
With a guy like Mickey, the
best thing to do is to take

275
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,496
something away.

276
00:19:17,262 --> 00:19:21,562
That was a thing he should
have lost a long time ago.

277
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:25,928
His virginity!

278
00:19:30,395 --> 00:19:39,230
Ladies and gentleman, allow
me to introduce to you the

279
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:41,927
very beautiful Roxanne!

280
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:27,557
I hate him!

281
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:29,423
What happened?

282
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:31,257
My god, Manny,
what happened?

283
00:21:31,357 --> 00:21:33,657
He totally ditched me.

284
00:21:33,757 --> 00:21:34,690
Forget about him.

285
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:36,856
Josh, it was so embarrassing.

286
00:21:36,957 --> 00:21:38,857
Manny...

287
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,258
Help me.

288
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:56,589
What's going on?

289
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,622
Hey, Sam.

290
00:21:57,721 --> 00:21:58,955
Is Amanda OK?

291
00:21:59,056 --> 00:22:00,356
I don't know.

292
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:06,856
Maybe you could help.

293
00:22:06,957 --> 00:22:08,423
She doesn't talk to me.

294
00:22:13,722 --> 00:22:15,155
You're a good brother, Josh.

295
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:25,552
What are you doing?

296
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:26,751
Filming.

297
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:30,618
Why?

298
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,752
Because.

299
00:23:34,852 --> 00:23:36,719
Josh!

300
00:23:36,818 --> 00:23:38,684
I'm so happy!

301
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:40,652
I'm so happy!

302
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:43,384
We're done!

303
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:45,051
I guess you guys passed
your chem final?

304
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:48,552
Three whole months without
this fucking skirt.

305
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:49,352
Yeah.

306
00:23:49,451 --> 00:23:50,884
So when are you guys done?

307
00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:54,784
Well, Brainiac here got the
senior exemption on the math

308
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:55,817
final.

309
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:56,717
I gotta be good at something.

310
00:23:56,817 --> 00:23:58,783
I'm taking it tomorrow.

311
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:01,049
And then graduation.

312
00:24:01,151 --> 00:24:01,685
Nice.

313
00:24:01,785 --> 00:24:02,384
Yeah!

314
00:24:02,484 --> 00:24:02,884
Next week.

315
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:03,884
Yeah!

316
00:24:03,982 --> 00:24:05,050
Yes!

317
00:24:05,151 --> 00:24:07,417
Hey, have you guys
seen Ben, or...

318
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:09,350
There he is.

319
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:10,750
I gotta go.

320
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:12,683
Bye, guys.

321
00:24:12,782 --> 00:24:13,682
Amanda, come.

322
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:14,317
No, that's OK.

323
00:24:14,417 --> 00:24:15,283
You go.

324
00:24:19,616 --> 00:24:20,517
Hey, Seth?

325
00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:21,716
Can I bum a cigarette?

326
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:36,749
Hey, you guys
wanna get some coffee?

327
00:24:45,782 --> 00:24:46,815
We're going to Star-bizzle.

328
00:24:46,915 --> 00:24:48,214
Wanna come?

329
00:24:55,415 --> 00:24:56,515
Well?

330
00:25:07,948 --> 00:25:09,248
Bye, guys.

331
00:25:11,748 --> 00:25:13,682
Bye, guys.

332
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,080
What?

333
00:25:30,078 --> 00:25:32,047
My god, look at Allie.

334
00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:34,612
What a slut.

335
00:25:34,712 --> 00:25:36,180
Who does this?

336
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,413
I mean, are you really gonna
want your grandkids to see you

337
00:25:37,513 --> 00:25:38,613
looking like that?

338
00:25:43,179 --> 00:25:45,146
You're looking good here.

339
00:25:45,246 --> 00:25:46,546
Very much the stud.

340
00:25:48,912 --> 00:25:50,312
Aren't you gonna sign it?

341
00:25:50,412 --> 00:25:52,413
I only sign for people I'm
never going to see again.

342
00:26:03,878 --> 00:26:06,211
What did she write?

343
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:10,311
Some crap about how we've both
had hard times, and she

344
00:26:10,412 --> 00:26:10,944
understands.

345
00:26:11,045 --> 00:26:12,312
Blah, blah, blah.

346
00:26:12,412 --> 00:26:14,711
I think I might tear
out the page.

347
00:26:14,811 --> 00:26:16,778
She's just trying to be nice.

348
00:26:16,878 --> 00:26:20,310
Yeah, well she doesn't know
what it's like for me.

349
00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:22,178
It's just like I don't
know her shit. it's

350
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:23,577
dishonest, you know?

351
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,310
Got any weed?

352
00:26:32,243 --> 00:26:33,910
A horse, a horse!

353
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,411
My kingdom for a horse!

354
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,576
Greatest line in the
history of theater.

355
00:26:42,277 --> 00:26:45,443
We can visit each other
in college, for sure.

356
00:26:45,544 --> 00:26:46,110
If you want me to.

357
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,742
Of course I do.

358
00:26:47,843 --> 00:26:49,144
Idiot.

359
00:27:02,342 --> 00:27:03,643
I have to tell you something.

360
00:27:08,709 --> 00:27:10,541
Josh...

361
00:27:10,642 --> 00:27:12,475
That's a scary way to
start a conversation.

362
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:17,143
So?

363
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:22,108
Promise you won't hate me?

364
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,608
Dude, what could be so awful?

365
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:24,809
Are you gay, or something?

366
00:27:28,575 --> 00:27:29,673
What if I was?

367
00:27:34,907 --> 00:27:36,207
Fuck.

368
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,673
Why didn't you tell me?

369
00:27:48,574 --> 00:27:50,374
What, I'm the last one
to know, right?

370
00:27:50,473 --> 00:27:52,441
No!

371
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,340
My best friend's a faggot, and
I'm the last one to know.

372
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:26,505
Do I look gay?

373
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:31,138
Are we talking Elton John,
or Tom Cruise gay?

374
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:32,673
I'm not gay, Sam.

375
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:34,739
I know.

376
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,671
But if you were, I'd
still love you.

377
00:28:47,871 --> 00:28:49,171
Check it.

378
00:28:52,936 --> 00:28:54,769
This is what got me
into film school.

379
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,370
Josh, it's incredible.

380
00:29:25,969 --> 00:29:27,603
She's so beautiful.

381
00:29:39,102 --> 00:29:41,569
Does
she speak to you?

382
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:42,801
No.

383
00:29:42,902 --> 00:29:43,969
It's my fault.

384
00:29:44,068 --> 00:29:46,403
I never paid much attention
to her.

385
00:29:46,501 --> 00:29:47,601
Stop.

386
00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:53,098
Hey.

387
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:54,565
Can I come in?

388
00:30:54,664 --> 00:30:56,632
What's the matter?

389
00:30:56,731 --> 00:30:58,032
Do me a favor?

390
00:31:00,498 --> 00:31:03,998
Tel me everything you
know about Ryan.

391
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:05,731
I want to know who he
hangs out with.

392
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,131
You know, everything.

393
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:15,630
Ryan and I only have
one thing in common.

394
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,031
You.

395
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,430
Stop.

396
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:26,563
Why do you want him so bad?

397
00:31:26,663 --> 00:31:28,962
Everyone wants him.

398
00:31:29,063 --> 00:31:32,830
And so that's why
you want him?

399
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,230
Yeah.

400
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:40,230
It's more like I need him.

401
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,496
He's a dick, Amanda.

402
00:31:49,163 --> 00:31:51,663
I'm not gonna say it again.

403
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:52,663
He's trouble.

404
00:31:52,762 --> 00:31:54,062
I know it.

405
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:07,228
I have this dream where I'm
in my room at night.

406
00:32:07,328 --> 00:32:12,361
And all these guys start coming
in, one by one, and

407
00:32:12,461 --> 00:32:15,028
they fuck me.

408
00:32:15,128 --> 00:32:16,561
All of them.

409
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:17,894
At the same time.

410
00:32:17,994 --> 00:32:21,327
And I like it.

411
00:32:21,426 --> 00:32:24,228
So, I guess I just
like trouble.

412
00:32:36,028 --> 00:32:38,161
Come on.

413
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,659
Wouldn't you want to
get that on tape?

414
00:32:48,095 --> 00:32:49,394
I saw you.

415
00:32:51,794 --> 00:32:55,060
Through the door.

416
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,660
I should have had my camera.

417
00:37:27,282 --> 00:37:28,382
Seth!

418
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:35,047
Hey man, what's up?

419
00:37:35,148 --> 00:37:36,014
What's up?

420
00:37:36,114 --> 00:37:37,213
How have you been, dude?

421
00:37:37,313 --> 00:37:38,647
I've been waiting here
for like, days.

422
00:37:38,748 --> 00:37:39,914
We did the whole family
celebratory lunch thing.

423
00:37:40,014 --> 00:37:40,815
Good.

424
00:37:40,914 --> 00:37:42,246
Yeah, it's all good.

425
00:37:42,347 --> 00:37:45,180
They're giving me a bangin'
Mac Pro with Final Cut.

426
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,946
With an HD monitor?

427
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:46,713
30 inch.

428
00:37:46,813 --> 00:37:48,047
That's dope.

429
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:49,447
That's tight.

430
00:37:52,213 --> 00:37:55,014
I'm an asshole, man.

431
00:37:55,114 --> 00:37:55,980
Stupid fuck.

432
00:37:56,081 --> 00:37:57,546
I'm sorry.

433
00:37:57,646 --> 00:38:00,478
It's OK.

434
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:02,144
I'm the asshole.

435
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:03,912
Dropping that on
you like that.

436
00:38:04,012 --> 00:38:05,179
Yeah, well, it freaked
me out.

437
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,379
But I, I shouldn't have
reacted that way.

438
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,579
I'm sorry.

439
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:13,745
It's really... it's no
big deal, anyway.

440
00:38:13,846 --> 00:38:15,346
Let's forget about the
whole thing, OK?

441
00:38:15,445 --> 00:38:17,311
I'm fine.

442
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:19,045
Thanks for understanding,
man.

443
00:38:25,077 --> 00:38:28,278
Do your parents know?

444
00:38:28,378 --> 00:38:30,911
My mom.

445
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,311
She says she always knew.

446
00:38:35,911 --> 00:38:37,311
I always knew.

447
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:39,476
It's a relief to finally
admit it.

448
00:38:39,577 --> 00:38:41,545
That must have been a
heavy load to carry.

449
00:38:41,644 --> 00:38:42,445
Yeah.

450
00:38:42,545 --> 00:38:44,443
From you, especially.

451
00:38:44,543 --> 00:38:47,344
My dad, too.

452
00:38:47,445 --> 00:38:50,977
I think his reaction's gonna
make yours look calm.

453
00:38:51,077 --> 00:38:53,645
The macho fuck.

454
00:38:53,744 --> 00:38:55,477
I'm sorry.

455
00:38:55,577 --> 00:38:56,677
It's OK.

456
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:05,576
So nobody else knows?

457
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:06,477
Not really.

458
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:07,677
Not really?

459
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:15,043
Well, there's this,
sophomore, Harry.

460
00:39:15,143 --> 00:39:15,909
Harry the Fairy?

461
00:39:16,009 --> 00:39:18,175
Don't say that.

462
00:39:18,275 --> 00:39:22,708
You weren't really tutoring
him, were you?

463
00:39:22,809 --> 00:39:25,476
I taught him a lot.

464
00:39:25,576 --> 00:39:28,242
You're fucking Harry?

465
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:29,942
Some fucking, yeah,
but mostly sucking.

466
00:39:30,041 --> 00:39:30,843
Dude, come on.

467
00:39:30,943 --> 00:39:31,742
Spare me the details.

468
00:39:31,842 --> 00:39:32,876
No.

469
00:39:32,974 --> 00:39:34,208
I will not spare you
the details.

470
00:39:36,576 --> 00:39:38,942
I've had to listen to pussy
this, and pussy that, and look

471
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:42,241
at that rack since forever.

472
00:39:42,342 --> 00:39:43,875
If we're going to be friends,
you're going to have to listen

473
00:39:43,974 --> 00:39:45,842
to me, too.

474
00:39:45,942 --> 00:39:48,775
You were worse than me.

475
00:39:48,875 --> 00:39:50,173
I was faking it.

476
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:54,742
Well, just so you know,
I cannot fake any

477
00:39:54,842 --> 00:39:56,141
cock talk, all right?

478
00:40:03,074 --> 00:40:04,375
Someone else knows.

479
00:40:04,474 --> 00:40:07,007
Who?

480
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:10,874
Your, your sister,
Amanda.

481
00:40:10,974 --> 00:40:13,073
We were at Matt's
party last year.

482
00:40:13,172 --> 00:40:14,306
She made a pass at me.

483
00:40:14,407 --> 00:40:15,841
I told her then.

484
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,972
My god.

485
00:40:17,072 --> 00:40:18,239
You really are gay,
aren't you?

486
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,140
I mean, everybody wants
to fuck my sister.

487
00:41:01,103 --> 00:41:02,038
I forgot my key.

488
00:41:02,137 --> 00:41:02,938
Where have you been?

489
00:41:03,038 --> 00:41:03,936
You knew I'd be late.

490
00:41:04,038 --> 00:41:05,737
Fuck you.

491
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,304
You're drunk, Susan.

492
00:41:07,405 --> 00:41:09,638
Fuck you.

493
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:12,936
This is a $300 shirt.

494
00:41:13,036 --> 00:41:14,336
You sicken me.

495
00:41:17,938 --> 00:41:20,436
Who is she?

496
00:41:20,536 --> 00:41:22,102
Who is she?

497
00:41:22,202 --> 00:41:25,170
Who are you fucking?

498
00:41:25,269 --> 00:41:27,637
Your cell phone called home,
and I've got 20 minutes of

499
00:41:27,737 --> 00:41:29,903
your good times recorded on
this answering machine.

500
00:41:30,003 --> 00:41:32,702
Do you want to hear it?

501
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:36,302
I mean, we
were walking along outside.

502
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:42,269
If you had been there...

503
00:42:12,934 --> 00:42:13,934
Put the paper down.

504
00:42:14,034 --> 00:42:15,034
We're not done yet.

505
00:42:15,134 --> 00:42:16,235
Put the booze down.

506
00:42:16,335 --> 00:42:19,335
You're dangerous when
you're drunk.

507
00:42:19,434 --> 00:42:21,534
Which seems to be all the
time now, doesn't it?

508
00:42:25,034 --> 00:42:27,934
Who do you think you are?

509
00:42:28,032 --> 00:42:28,835
An angry drunk.

510
00:42:28,934 --> 00:42:30,701
That's the worst kind.

511
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:31,967
Don't.

512
00:42:32,067 --> 00:42:34,568
I am warning you, do not
ever hit me again.

513
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:36,634
Who is she?

514
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:38,034
No one.

515
00:42:40,567 --> 00:42:42,134
Big deal.

516
00:42:42,233 --> 00:42:44,498
I went out for drinks
after work.

517
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:46,467
Bullshit.

518
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,867
Who is she?

519
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:50,733
Why do you care?

520
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:52,298
You admit it.

521
00:42:52,398 --> 00:42:54,065
No.

522
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:55,700
Why would you care if I am?

523
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,333
Fuck you.

524
00:42:56,432 --> 00:42:56,865
Yeah.

525
00:42:56,965 --> 00:42:58,199
I doubt it.

526
00:43:05,032 --> 00:43:07,398
You think you cornered the
market on suffering?

527
00:43:07,498 --> 00:43:10,865
You think that maybe for once
you could understand that my

528
00:43:10,965 --> 00:43:13,197
life ended six years ago?

529
00:43:13,297 --> 00:43:17,531
Have you ever thought about
anyone but yourself since?

530
00:43:17,632 --> 00:43:19,898
We lost you, too.

531
00:43:19,998 --> 00:43:22,065
I loved her.

532
00:43:22,164 --> 00:43:23,465
We all loved her.

533
00:43:26,264 --> 00:43:27,565
She killed me, too.

534
00:43:37,565 --> 00:43:39,097
She's...

535
00:43:39,197 --> 00:43:42,498
Our daughter's getting
married this weekend.

536
00:43:42,597 --> 00:43:46,365
Marla's very happy, but,
I hope she knows

537
00:43:46,463 --> 00:43:47,563
what she's in for.

538
00:44:02,896 --> 00:44:05,363
Kids?

539
00:44:05,463 --> 00:44:05,862
Who's in there?

540
00:44:07,463 --> 00:44:08,795
Hello?

541
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,363
Hell...

542
00:44:10,463 --> 00:44:11,363
My god.

543
00:44:11,463 --> 00:44:12,730
My god!

544
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:13,695
Susan!

545
00:44:13,797 --> 00:44:14,295
Samantha!

546
00:44:14,394 --> 00:44:14,829
No!

547
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:15,661
No, no, no!

548
00:44:15,762 --> 00:44:16,262
No!

549
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:16,762
No!

550
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,061
Samantha!

551
00:44:44,728 --> 00:44:48,128
Do you remember when, Mom
and Dad went out to the,

552
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:49,661
the Broadway show,
the matinee?

553
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,360
And we got all naked and used
Mom's makeup to paint our

554
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,827
whole bodies?

555
00:44:53,927 --> 00:44:54,894
I was a robot.

556
00:44:54,994 --> 00:44:56,394
And I was a tattoo lady.

557
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:01,860
You got blamed, even though
I thought of it?

558
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,126
What are big sisters for?

559
00:45:05,226 --> 00:45:07,460
You used to run into my
bed every time you

560
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:09,059
had a little nightmare.

561
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:10,460
You are my Joshy-poo.

562
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:18,626
Why did you do it, Sam?

563
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:26,992
The shrinks say I should
be mad at you.

564
00:45:29,626 --> 00:45:31,360
You can be mad if it helps.

565
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,357
What are you doing?

566
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:45,591
Nothing.

567
00:45:45,692 --> 00:45:48,125
Waiting up for me?

568
00:45:48,224 --> 00:45:50,458
Do you need me to help
you pack for college?

569
00:45:50,557 --> 00:45:51,458
No.

570
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:52,659
I got time.

571
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:57,090
I'm hardly bringing
anything, anyway.

572
00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:00,723
Just the suitcase
and my backpack.

573
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:02,125
That's it.

574
00:46:02,224 --> 00:46:03,923
What more do I need?

575
00:46:04,025 --> 00:46:05,891
Just me!

576
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:07,623
I'm definitely coming
with you.

577
00:46:07,724 --> 00:46:09,990
You can't leave me here alone.

578
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,557
You've got Ryan.

579
00:46:11,657 --> 00:46:12,922
You know what I mean.

580
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:14,990
And you can't leave me
here alone with them.

581
00:46:22,889 --> 00:46:24,889
Is he hurting you?

582
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:27,555
Don't be such a pussy, Josh.

583
00:46:27,655 --> 00:46:28,757
I like it rough.

584
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:33,523
It's gonna be fine.

585
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:39,689
I worry a little.

586
00:46:51,487 --> 00:46:54,755
Can I sleep in here
with you tonight?

587
00:46:54,856 --> 00:46:56,155
Sure.

588
00:47:01,155 --> 00:47:04,221
OK, but let's go to sleep,
because I am really exhausted.

589
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:05,222
OK.

590
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,822
Could you get the
light, please?

591
00:47:09,987 --> 00:47:11,288
Thank you.

592
00:47:19,688 --> 00:47:22,387
Can you not steal all
the covers tonight?

593
00:47:22,487 --> 00:47:26,620
I can make no promises
in that regard.

594
00:47:26,721 --> 00:47:28,586
You're a cover monster.

595
00:47:28,686 --> 00:47:29,987
Cover monster.

596
00:47:39,985 --> 00:47:41,286
Joshy-washy.

597
00:47:44,952 --> 00:47:47,454
Manny-Danny.

598
00:47:47,552 --> 00:47:48,652
Yay.

599
00:48:28,684 --> 00:48:30,183
Morning.

600
00:48:30,284 --> 00:48:31,184
Hi.

601
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:32,550
Remember, we're having
dinner with the

602
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:33,784
Brahams tonight at 7:30.

603
00:48:33,885 --> 00:48:35,717
You want me to send
a car for you?

604
00:48:35,817 --> 00:48:38,416
That would be nice.

605
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:40,449
All righty.

606
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:41,751
Have a good day.

607
00:49:13,782 --> 00:49:15,383
I warned you about
Ryan, Manny.

608
00:49:23,016 --> 00:49:24,315
See...

609
00:49:29,215 --> 00:49:31,048
it's nothing I can't handle.

610
00:49:31,148 --> 00:49:32,215
But what if you can't?

611
00:49:32,315 --> 00:49:33,048
I can.

612
00:49:33,148 --> 00:49:34,282
Yeah, but what if you can't?

613
00:49:42,048 --> 00:49:44,181
I'd kill myself if anything
ever happened to you.

614
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,347
It's weird.

615
00:49:53,447 --> 00:49:57,547
When things get messed up
sometimes I say to myself,

616
00:49:57,646 --> 00:49:59,247
what would Sammy do?

617
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:05,713
She would slit her wrists.

618
00:50:05,813 --> 00:50:07,079
Quiet.

619
00:50:07,179 --> 00:50:08,646
Neatly, of course.

620
00:50:08,746 --> 00:50:10,379
No mess for anyone
to clean up.

621
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,413
Shut up Manny.

622
00:50:11,512 --> 00:50:12,846
Just drop the body
off at the morgue.

623
00:50:12,945 --> 00:50:14,313
Get on with your life.

624
00:50:14,414 --> 00:50:15,380
Stop it.

625
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,547
What a great role model,
your big sister.

626
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:25,080
Get out of my room.

627
00:50:31,644 --> 00:50:32,478
You know what?

628
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:33,412
Face it, Josh.

629
00:50:33,512 --> 00:50:37,045
You're never going
t a filmmaker.

630
00:50:37,144 --> 00:50:39,278
You're gonna cave like
everyone else.

631
00:50:43,478 --> 00:50:48,211
You'll go to business school
and get a job you hate.

632
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:51,045
You'll marry a woman you'll
grow to hate.

633
00:50:51,146 --> 00:50:54,845
And have kids, because that's
what people do.

634
00:50:54,945 --> 00:50:57,845
You're gonna get fat,
go bald, and die

635
00:50:57,943 --> 00:51:01,043
wondering what the fuck?

636
00:51:01,143 --> 00:51:03,543
And then I'm just gonna marry
someone who doesn't even

637
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:05,677
understand me.

638
00:51:05,777 --> 00:51:08,443
But I mean, at least he'll buy
me lots of expensive things,

639
00:51:08,543 --> 00:51:14,045
and keep me in booze and pills,
and in a couple of

640
00:51:14,144 --> 00:51:16,809
years, I'll probably pop out
a couple kids and start the

641
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:18,609
whole fucking thing
over again.

642
00:51:21,842 --> 00:51:22,710
You know what?

643
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:24,610
Actually, I take it back.

644
00:51:24,708 --> 00:51:26,808
Maybe she had the right idea.

645
00:51:26,909 --> 00:51:28,510
Why should we even bother?

646
00:51:47,775 --> 00:51:49,076
How could she do this?

647
00:51:53,574 --> 00:51:56,074
Mom's an alcoholic, Josh.

648
00:51:56,175 --> 00:51:58,675
Alcoholics drink too much.

649
00:51:58,775 --> 00:51:59,742
What happened?

650
00:51:59,842 --> 00:52:01,742
She tore the house up.

651
00:52:01,842 --> 00:52:03,541
You know how she gets.

652
00:52:07,806 --> 00:52:09,307
But do they know
their father?

653
00:52:12,175 --> 00:52:15,673
Do they know their father is
screwing Karen in the European

654
00:52:15,773 --> 00:52:17,340
Equities division?

655
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,306
Susan.

656
00:52:19,407 --> 00:52:26,940
After Samantha, he promised
me he'd stop

657
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:28,340
screwing his secretary.

658
00:52:32,139 --> 00:52:34,141
After all, she's the one
who caught them.

659
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,972
She is out of her mind.

660
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:39,906
Is that true?

661
00:52:40,007 --> 00:52:42,007
Your father is a man of
his word, my dear.

662
00:52:42,106 --> 00:52:45,440
He dumped Sharon.

663
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:48,139
But he's been fucking
Karen ever since.

664
00:52:50,739 --> 00:52:53,905
First Sharon, then Karen.

665
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:55,306
It rhymes.

666
00:52:58,505 --> 00:52:59,605
Who's next, Mark?

667
00:53:01,972 --> 00:53:03,505
You did that in
front of Sammy?

668
00:53:13,005 --> 00:53:14,506
Where are you going?

669
00:53:14,606 --> 00:53:14,871
Hey.

670
00:53:14,971 --> 00:53:15,606
Dad.

671
00:53:15,704 --> 00:53:16,737
No, no no.

672
00:53:16,838 --> 00:53:18,172
Get out of my way, Josh.

673
00:53:21,771 --> 00:53:23,072
Sorry.

674
00:53:47,469 --> 00:53:49,368
Dad!

675
00:53:49,469 --> 00:53:51,336
Dad!

676
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,737
Fuck you, OK?

677
00:53:52,836 --> 00:53:53,735
Fuck you man!

678
00:53:53,835 --> 00:53:54,902
You're a fucking disgrace!

679
00:53:55,003 --> 00:53:58,670
How could you fucking
do this to us?

680
00:54:01,768 --> 00:54:02,435
Dad!

681
00:54:02,536 --> 00:54:03,137
Come on, man.

682
00:54:03,237 --> 00:54:04,536
Please just talk to me.

683
00:54:04,635 --> 00:54:05,735
Please.

684
00:55:23,532 --> 00:55:24,400
Yo, Seth.

685
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,199
Is there any way we
could hang out?

686
00:55:27,298 --> 00:55:28,398
Cool.

687
00:55:31,565 --> 00:55:32,166
No, actually.

688
00:55:32,266 --> 00:55:34,565
I'm right downstairs.

689
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,498
Yeah.

690
00:55:36,597 --> 00:55:37,831
OK.

691
00:55:37,931 --> 00:55:39,230
All right man.

692
00:55:45,465 --> 00:55:46,364
Yo, check me out!

693
00:55:46,465 --> 00:55:47,565
I'm Ryan.

694
00:55:53,931 --> 00:55:55,798
My god.

695
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:56,797
Wait, dude.

696
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:58,097
This is good.

697
00:55:58,197 --> 00:55:58,864
This is good but you forgot
one thing here.

698
00:55:58,963 --> 00:56:00,329
It's the face.

699
00:56:00,431 --> 00:56:03,097
Yeah!

700
00:56:03,197 --> 00:56:04,664
He does do that face!

701
00:56:08,697 --> 00:56:09,829
No!

702
00:56:09,929 --> 00:56:11,163
And you know when he
does it like, when

703
00:56:11,264 --> 00:56:12,329
nobody's there, right?

704
00:56:12,429 --> 00:56:13,163
And he's all...

705
00:56:13,262 --> 00:56:16,730
He knows everybody's watching.

706
00:56:16,829 --> 00:56:18,130
Yo you've got it, dude.

707
00:56:18,231 --> 00:56:22,263
And the pants are out.

708
00:56:22,362 --> 00:56:22,896
Yeah.

709
00:56:22,996 --> 00:56:24,329
Survey the crowd.

710
00:56:24,429 --> 00:56:24,895
Yeah.

711
00:56:24,996 --> 00:56:25,697
Just check out...

712
00:56:30,496 --> 00:56:31,596
Stop!

713
00:56:40,262 --> 00:56:43,761
Yo, you got anymore?

714
00:56:43,862 --> 00:56:45,096
No.

715
00:56:45,195 --> 00:56:46,963
No more alcohol for you.

716
00:56:49,394 --> 00:56:54,094
But I've been saving
something for a rainy day.

717
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:15,627
One for me.

718
00:57:15,728 --> 00:57:18,726
And one for thee.

719
00:57:29,226 --> 00:57:31,659
Rakim is the best for
the simple reason

720
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,226
that he was the first.

721
00:57:33,326 --> 00:57:38,527
I mean, to combine syllables,
patterns, and, and technical

722
00:57:38,626 --> 00:57:42,360
construction, all, all with
a panoramic third eye?

723
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,126
Come on.

724
00:57:43,226 --> 00:57:44,659
I mean, he was the first.

725
00:57:44,759 --> 00:57:47,925
All these other guys, they rap
on the premise that Rakim

726
00:57:48,025 --> 00:57:48,891
originated.

727
00:57:48,992 --> 00:57:50,326
You know what I'm saying?

728
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,625
Like, like he, he created from,
from a blank canvas

729
00:57:52,726 --> 00:57:55,992
while these other guys, they
just took the baton from there

730
00:57:56,092 --> 00:57:57,392
and continued on.

731
00:57:57,492 --> 00:58:00,692
So to say that someone is
better, just, you know...

732
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:02,459
Dude, shut up.

733
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,392
You're white.

734
00:58:05,492 --> 00:58:08,490
That's racist.

735
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:10,590
Hostility over here.

736
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:13,256
I mean, a lot of people would
say, a lot of people, a lot of

737
00:58:13,356 --> 00:58:16,425
people would say,
but he was a one syllable man.

738
00:58:16,525 --> 00:58:18,825
Another great rapper
was Cool-G guy.

739
00:58:18,925 --> 00:58:19,791
Yeah.

740
00:58:19,891 --> 00:58:21,625
Who, heavily...

741
00:58:21,724 --> 00:58:25,990
Pardon the pun, heavily built
up Big Pun's success.

742
00:58:33,356 --> 00:58:34,623
Hold on.

743
00:58:34,724 --> 00:58:36,124
The bastard's got my stash.

744
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:36,556
No.

745
00:58:36,657 --> 00:58:37,423
Come on.

746
00:58:37,523 --> 00:58:38,958
We don't need it.

747
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:50,355
Besides, I, I got something
better, anyway.

748
00:58:59,722 --> 00:59:01,023
Yeah, come on.

749
00:59:09,489 --> 00:59:10,588
What?

750
00:59:20,989 --> 00:59:24,487
So...

751
00:59:24,588 --> 00:59:26,954
I was...

752
00:59:27,054 --> 00:59:30,088
With my, Mom and Dad.

753
00:59:30,188 --> 00:59:32,255
Did you know my Mom...

754
00:59:32,355 --> 00:59:34,221
Did you know she was
in the hospital?

755
00:59:36,788 --> 00:59:38,088
Alcohol poisoning.

756
00:59:44,021 --> 00:59:47,454
And my dad, man.

757
00:59:47,554 --> 00:59:51,354
He's cheating on her.

758
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:51,920
I know.

759
00:59:52,019 --> 00:59:53,153
I didn't know.

760
00:59:57,952 --> 01:00:03,652
And so we found out they're
just fucked up.

761
01:00:12,387 --> 01:00:15,385
So I like, tried
to talk to hi.

762
01:00:15,485 --> 01:00:16,984
On the street.

763
01:00:17,085 --> 01:00:18,186
You know, he just didn't...

764
01:00:18,286 --> 01:00:20,485
He didn't want to talk to me.

765
01:00:25,219 --> 01:00:30,052
So he just got in a cab,
and sailed away.

766
01:00:32,619 --> 01:00:34,751
He'll come back.

767
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:35,485
Naw.

768
01:00:35,585 --> 01:00:36,552
I doubt it.

769
01:00:40,152 --> 01:00:43,019
Anyway, he wouldn't need to.

770
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,351
We've got Mom to take
care of us.

771
01:00:45,451 --> 01:00:48,951
When she's not slipping
off into a coma.

772
01:00:49,050 --> 01:00:51,384
Not funny, Josh.

773
01:00:51,483 --> 01:00:52,583
Yeah, I know.

774
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:59,716
Anyway, who cares about me?

775
01:00:59,817 --> 01:01:02,083
I'm leaving next week.

776
01:01:02,184 --> 01:01:04,583
It's Manny you've got
to worry about.

777
01:01:04,682 --> 01:01:06,949
I'll keep my eye on her.

778
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:08,350
Thanks, man.

779
01:01:12,215 --> 01:01:13,516
I would do anything for you.

780
01:01:16,949 --> 01:01:19,382
You know that, right?

781
01:01:19,483 --> 01:01:20,583
Yeah.

782
01:01:31,715 --> 01:01:33,415
Just remember, she
likes to dance.

783
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:28,380
This shit.

784
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:40,211
I'm sorry, man.

785
01:02:40,311 --> 01:02:42,413
I'm scared I really fucked up.

786
01:03:23,045 --> 01:03:24,344
Squeeze.

787
01:03:27,945 --> 01:03:28,811
Harder.

788
01:03:28,911 --> 01:03:29,778
Harder!

789
01:03:29,878 --> 01:03:32,478
Come on.

790
01:03:32,577 --> 01:03:33,777
Harder!

791
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:34,610
Come on!

792
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,443
Wait, that hurts!

793
01:03:36,543 --> 01:03:38,742
Come on!

794
01:03:38,842 --> 01:03:40,609
You're hurting me.

795
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:41,943
I'm not gonna hurt you.

796
01:03:42,043 --> 01:03:43,343
Wait, you are hurting me.

797
01:04:38,273 --> 01:04:39,206
No!

798
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:20,572
What's up?

799
01:05:20,672 --> 01:05:21,972
You look horrible.

800
01:05:24,505 --> 01:05:25,606
You were right.

801
01:05:47,036 --> 01:05:48,103
Am I hurting you?

802
01:05:48,204 --> 01:05:51,105
No.

803
01:05:51,204 --> 01:05:52,304
Good.

804
01:06:00,570 --> 01:06:02,437
I'll kill him if you want.

805
01:06:10,769 --> 01:06:12,269
What are we gonna do?

806
01:06:15,702 --> 01:06:18,369
It's gonna be OK.

807
01:06:18,469 --> 01:06:19,568
But you're leaving.

808
01:06:33,934 --> 01:06:36,601
It's just too weird.

809
01:06:36,702 --> 01:06:38,535
Maybe I won't go.

810
01:06:38,635 --> 01:06:39,535
No.

811
01:06:39,635 --> 01:06:40,535
No, you're going.

812
01:06:40,635 --> 01:06:41,936
Or I'll kill you.

813
01:06:47,902 --> 01:06:50,367
And you're gonna meet a
nice girl in college.

814
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:11,634
I love you, Joshy.

815
01:07:11,733 --> 01:07:13,634
I love you too, Manny.

816
01:08:24,264 --> 01:08:25,364
No.

817
01:08:35,997 --> 01:08:38,063
You can have what's
left of me.

818
01:08:41,563 --> 01:08:43,663
No.

819
01:08:43,761 --> 01:08:45,063
No.

820
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:48,329
Stop.

821
01:08:59,362 --> 01:09:02,628
I hate you!

822
01:09:02,729 --> 01:09:04,962
I hate you!

823
01:09:05,061 --> 01:09:06,862
I hate you!

824
01:09:06,962 --> 01:09:09,828
I hate you!

825
01:09:09,927 --> 01:09:12,362
I hate you!

826
01:09:12,461 --> 01:09:13,962
I hate you!

827
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:55,152
The way I mean

828
01:12:55,252 --> 01:12:59,651
I've got everything
packed up.

829
01:12:59,752 --> 01:13:02,618
Erase it.

830
01:13:02,717 --> 01:13:03,885
Why?

831
01:13:03,984 --> 01:13:06,651
Erase everything.

832
01:13:06,751 --> 01:13:09,650
The pictures, the videos.

833
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,949
Everything about me.

834
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:13,384
Don't save a thing, Josh.

835
01:13:13,484 --> 01:13:14,583
It's too...

836
01:13:17,318 --> 01:13:18,984
Just please, erase everything.

837
01:13:25,817 --> 01:13:26,716
All right.

838
01:13:26,817 --> 01:13:28,117
Thanks.

839
01:13:37,117 --> 01:13:38,416
It's better that way.

840
01:13:44,483 --> 01:13:49,682
I don't know if I can find the
words, the right words, to

841
01:13:49,783 --> 01:13:53,182
let you know how sorry I am.

842
01:13:53,283 --> 01:13:57,615
But I want you to know that
if you want, I want to

843
01:13:57,715 --> 01:13:59,016
be there for you.

844
01:14:01,849 --> 01:14:03,149
Fuck.

845
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:18,780
Hey.

846
01:14:18,881 --> 01:14:21,248
So, this is about
my 10th take.

847
01:14:21,347 --> 01:14:28,146
Everything I said sounds so
trite, I-I don't, I don't

848
01:14:28,247 --> 01:14:29,547
think I'm ever gonna
get this right.

849
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:45,314
Manny?

850
01:14:47,313 --> 01:14:49,246
Manny?

851
01:14:49,345 --> 01:14:49,746
Hey.

852
01:14:49,846 --> 01:14:52,313
Hey.

853
01:14:52,412 --> 01:14:54,045
They're sending Mom
home tomorrow.

854
01:14:54,145 --> 01:14:55,813
She wants us to pick her up.

855
01:14:55,912 --> 01:14:58,445
What about her husband?

856
01:14:58,546 --> 01:14:59,480
He's gone.

857
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:00,212
He's not coming back, either.

858
01:15:00,313 --> 01:15:01,413
You know that.

859
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:09,546
And I'm leaving for
LA on Wednesday.

860
01:15:09,645 --> 01:15:11,511
Yeah, well Mom and I can
hold down the fort.

861
01:15:14,145 --> 01:15:15,945
I've got to get
of here, Manny.

862
01:15:16,043 --> 01:15:17,578
Am I asking you to stay?

863
01:15:38,144 --> 01:15:41,610
Two more years,
and you're out.

864
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:44,244
It's like I'm doing time.

865
01:15:44,344 --> 01:15:47,377
Except you haven't done
anything wrong.

866
01:15:47,476 --> 01:15:48,577
No?

867
01:15:53,243 --> 01:15:55,043
Go.

868
01:15:55,144 --> 01:15:55,676
I wasn't gonna...

869
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,277
Go.

870
01:15:56,377 --> 01:15:59,210
Get out.

871
01:15:59,310 --> 01:15:59,877
Manny...

872
01:15:59,975 --> 01:16:01,042
Get out of my room.

873
01:16:04,042 --> 01:16:05,042
Why are you do...

874
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:07,409
Get out of my room!

875
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:08,077
I was just trying to...

876
01:16:08,176 --> 01:16:09,442
Get out of this state!

877
01:16:09,542 --> 01:16:10,643
Get out of my life!

878
01:17:01,673 --> 01:17:02,474
Yeah.

879
01:17:02,573 --> 01:17:03,373
It's right here, please.

880
01:17:26,905 --> 01:17:28,139
Hi.

881
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:29,773
Can you give this to Seth
when you see him?

882
01:17:29,872 --> 01:17:31,171
Thanks.

883
01:18:51,234 --> 01:18:52,335
Josh!

884
01:18:57,269 --> 01:18:58,702
Off you go.

885
01:18:58,801 --> 01:19:00,101
Yeah.

886
01:19:02,168 --> 01:19:05,902
It's gonna be hell around
here without you.

887
01:19:06,002 --> 01:19:07,369
It was hell around
here with me.

888
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,534
Guess I should go.

889
01:19:16,635 --> 01:19:17,935
Yeah.

890
01:19:21,635 --> 01:19:22,934
Bye, Joshy.

891
01:19:49,698 --> 01:19:50,665
Family weekend's
in October, OK?

892
01:19:50,765 --> 01:19:52,065
You'd better come.

893
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:15,530
Bye, Manny-fanny.

894
01:20:15,631 --> 01:20:16,932
Bye, Joshy-washy.

895
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:28,230
Hold on a second.

896
01:21:03,729 --> 01:21:05,030
OK, I'm ready.
