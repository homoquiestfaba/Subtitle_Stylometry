00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:18,847
Reverend Pflueger is my name,

184
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:23,393
and healing is my game.

185
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:27,439
I know I look like two
box cars bumped together

186
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:29,525
and I rolled out
of a hobo's ass,

187
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:31,443
but I had a rough night.

188
00:12:31,902 --> 00:12:32,861
I'm a man.

189
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:35,072
- [scoffs]
- [Pflueger] I'm just a man.

190
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:40,244
But the good Lord above
gave me a gift.

191
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:45,541
It's my life mission to share
that gift to His flock.

192
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,626
With these hands,

193
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:51,088
I could take away
anything that ails you,

194
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:53,549
whatever ails you.

195
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:57,386
With my touch,
you will be free from pain.

196
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:01,473
Is there anyone here
that could use my gift?

197
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:03,016
Anyone?

198
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:06,311
You.

199
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,067
What part of your body
has failed you, dear lady?

200
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,821
My back and my legs.

201
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:18,031
They're in excruciating pain.

202
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:19,825
Now, we're gonna fix that.

203
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:23,245
Yeah, please donate
to the healing jar...

204
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:26,123
- [woman] Oh.
- ...to empower my hands.

205
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:30,752
Together, we share
everything in this life.

206
00:13:31,461 --> 00:13:34,339
He will give energy
to my healing hands

207
00:13:34,673 --> 00:13:36,758
that God has bestowed upon me.

208
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:38,844
And I will heal you.

209
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:41,889
What part of your
leg really hurts you?

210
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:43,765
[woman] It's my left knee.

211
00:13:46,602 --> 00:13:47,561
[grunts]

212
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,146
Oh, Lord, Lord.

213
00:13:49,938 --> 00:13:52,774
In this moment,
just give me the healing power

214
00:13:52,941 --> 00:13:54,735
to heal this woman's leg.

215
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:56,778
To take the pain away.

216
00:13:57,154 --> 00:14:01,116
Heal this woman that she
might throw this walker away

217
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:02,534
to the side of the road.

218
00:14:02,951 --> 00:14:03,909
- [ominous music]
- [groaning]

219
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,704
Wait, did you hear that crack?

220
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:06,872
Did you hear it?

221
00:14:07,956 --> 00:14:09,458
Now tell me how you feel?

222
00:14:11,752 --> 00:14:12,711
I think...

223
00:14:14,421 --> 00:14:16,131
- It's a miracle!
- Yes!

224
00:14:16,423 --> 00:14:19,051
- [woman] It's a miracle!
- Just throw that walker to the side.

225
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:21,220
Throw it to
the side of the road.

226
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,432
- [man] Praise the Lord!
- I have no more pain.

227
00:14:25,974 --> 00:14:27,517
- Praise Jesus!
- Hallelujah!

228
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:29,061
- [man] Hallelujah!
- [Pflueger] Thank you.

229
00:14:29,311 --> 00:14:30,520
- [woman 2] Hallelujah!
- Uh-huh.

230
00:14:30,896 --> 00:14:33,190
Come closer,
this is not a trick!

231
00:14:33,857 --> 00:14:36,568
This is not done by me,
this is done by the Lord above!

232
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:38,362
I have no pain.

233
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:39,738
[laughing]

234
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:41,531
[woman] <i>Oh, thank Jesus.</i>

235
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:43,867
[tense music]

236
00:14:45,035 --> 00:14:45,744
[Pflueger] Uh, if he'll come.

237
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,788
[Bernice] He's too sick to move.

238
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,539
Oh, could you?

239
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,833
- [Pflueger] Let's do it.
- Okay, sounds good.

240
00:14:52,042 --> 00:14:53,377
I'm just gonna go grab my car

241
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:54,670
and then you can follow me?

242
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:57,089
[Pflueger] Yeah, sure.

243
00:14:57,798 --> 00:14:58,757
Thank you.

244
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:05,847
[bird calling]

245
00:15:09,434 --> 00:15:10,394
Very impressive.

246
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:12,938
How is it that you can heal?

247
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,649
God.

248
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:17,651
I can help you.

249
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:20,445
Excuse me?

250
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:22,239
I can help you.

251
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:25,867
Oh.
Who the fuck are you?

252
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:27,244
Red Elk.

253
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:29,830
- Red Ass?
- Red Elk.

254
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,040
Red Elk.
And I can help you

255
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,458
let go of the medicine.

256
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:35,419
The medicine?

257
00:15:36,128 --> 00:15:37,045
My power to heal?

258
00:15:39,923 --> 00:15:42,175
Why would I ever do that, Chief?

259
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,137
[ominous music]

260
00:15:45,387 --> 00:15:46,805
[Red Elk] You cannot be harmed.

261
00:15:47,097 --> 00:15:49,683
Whoever tries will
feel the pain.

262
00:15:50,225 --> 00:15:54,021
It protects itself,
so it protects its host.

263
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:56,231
That is the medicine's gift.

264
00:15:56,606 --> 00:15:58,734
I'm Reverend Pflueger,
the healer.

265
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:02,029
Healing is a special gift
to repair a weakness.

266
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:05,449
The medicine is purity,
but if you abuse it,

267
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:07,701
you will eventually
destroy yourself.

268
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:12,831
Who gives a fuck what
I do with my power?

269
00:16:13,332 --> 00:16:15,042
It doesn't belong to you!

270
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,959
That grave is over
100 years old.

271
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:20,881
I protect it,
my father protected it,

272
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:23,008
my grandfather protected it.

273
00:16:23,675 --> 00:16:26,303
You must give the medicine back.

274
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:27,512
Give it back?

275
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,890
I used to be a nobody,

276
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:33,101
and now
I'm Jesus fuckin' Christ,

277
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:35,395
and I'm gonna live forever,
Red Man.

278
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:37,147
Red Elk.

279
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:38,857
Whatever.

280
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:40,901
And you will not live forever.

281
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:42,152
Please.

282
00:16:43,236 --> 00:16:44,446
Trust me.

283
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:46,948
Trust me, my brother.

284
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,201
I am not your fuckin' brother.

285
00:16:50,535 --> 00:16:53,246
And I will never give
the power back to you.

286
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,791
- Ever.
- [car horn honking]

287
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,084
We're done here.

288
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,252
I have to go give my medicine

289
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:01,505
to this really
pretty young woman.

290
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:06,468
Adios, Chief Red Fucker.

291
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:09,930
Just... [mumbling]

292
00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:12,349
You know what I mean?
Fuck you.

293
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:16,812
[truck door slams]

294
00:17:19,147 --> 00:17:20,105
- Hi.
- [Bernice] Hi.

295
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,442
Yeah, so, just come in.

296
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,111
He's getting worse and worse.

297
00:17:24,528 --> 00:17:26,154
I really hate to
see a child suffer.

298
00:17:26,405 --> 00:17:27,531
But as I mentioned before,

299
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:29,282
I think we should take
care of the money first.

300
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:31,074
Because a lot of people,
you know,

301
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:33,118
they... they have
a change of heart

302
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,331
after I've done my work,
and you know what I mean.

303
00:17:36,581 --> 00:17:38,750
Yeah, no, of course.
I have it, I have it right here.

304
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:45,424
Where the fuck is my money?

305
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,509
Oh, what happened?

306
00:17:49,386 --> 00:17:51,096
Oh, that's okay,
I'll come back another time.

307
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:52,973
No, no, please,
no, I need you now.

308
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,183
Wait. There it is, sorry.

309
00:17:55,434 --> 00:17:56,393
[Pflueger] Ah.

310
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:58,770
- [Bernice] Thank you.
- Here you hold that.

311
00:18:01,231 --> 00:18:05,193
Why don't we take a look at
this boy of yours, shall we?

312
00:18:05,986 --> 00:18:06,945
Okay.

313
00:18:11,616 --> 00:18:12,659
[door opens]

314
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,119
[Bernice] Kelly?

315
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:15,454
There's someone here to see you.

316
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:17,998
This is Reverend Pflueger.

317
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:25,005
- May I ask you something?
- Mm-hm.

318
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,383
Will your husband be joining us?

319
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:33,096
No, um, Kelly's father died
before he was born, so...

320
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,306
[Pflueger] Oh.

321
00:18:35,223 --> 00:18:36,183
Sorry to hear that.

322
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:38,185
Thank you.

323
00:18:48,987 --> 00:18:50,071
You know what we're gonna do?

324
00:18:50,906 --> 00:18:52,073
We're gonna make you better,

325
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:54,075
we're gonna take care of you.

326
00:18:55,243 --> 00:18:57,204
- [Pflueger gasping]
- [ominous music]

327
00:18:57,454 --> 00:18:58,413
[Pflueger groaning]

328
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:00,999
[tense music]

329
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,250
[groans]

330
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,046
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah.

331
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:07,464
Before we get started,

332
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:10,050
can I use your facilities?

333
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:13,220
- P... please, please?
- Of course.

334
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,514
- [Pflueger] Thank you.
- Just down the hallway to the left.

335
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:18,141
Thank you, thank you...
Thank you.

336
00:19:20,185 --> 00:19:22,646
[music continues]

337
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:31,029
[toilet flushing]

338
00:19:37,202 --> 00:19:39,079
[sniffing]

339
00:19:40,121 --> 00:19:41,790
[mumbling]

340
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:49,506
You feeling better?

341
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,049
Yeah, yeah.

342
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,093
[breathing heavily]

343
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:54,928
Fit as a fiddle.

344
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:59,057
Yes, one... one of the good
things about being a healer,

345
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:01,101
you don't have any...

346
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,478
you don't have any,
uh, illnesses...

347
00:20:03,979 --> 00:20:04,938
no injuries.

348
00:20:07,315 --> 00:20:08,275
[sighs]

349
00:20:13,989 --> 00:20:14,948
[whispers] What's his name?

350
00:20:16,074 --> 00:20:17,033
Kelly.

351
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:20,704
Kelly.
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly... Kelly.

352
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:24,249
We have a lot in common,
you and me, Kelly.

353
00:20:25,542 --> 00:20:26,501
Pain.

354
00:20:27,711 --> 00:20:29,170
And a hope for light.

355
00:20:30,422 --> 00:20:31,131
[chuckles]

356
00:20:32,048 --> 00:20:33,008
Yeah.

357
00:20:34,676 --> 00:20:37,220
I only have half
a lung in my body.

358
00:20:40,307 --> 00:20:41,600
Then why are you smoking?

359
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:44,436
None of your fuckin' business.

360
00:20:47,355 --> 00:20:52,233
Oh, and once we start this,
there's no stopping it.

361
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:54,321
This is very powerful medicine.

362
00:20:54,613 --> 00:20:57,198
- We can't be interrupted.
- Okay.

What are you doing?

[coughing]

370
00:21:16,301 --> 00:21:17,344
Holy shit.

[coughing]

372
00:21:25,435 --> 00:21:26,936
I feel everything.

[screaming]

374
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,484
And it fucking hurts!

[gasping]

384
00:22:00,762 --> 00:22:01,721
Mom.

385
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:03,598
I'm hungry.

[indistinct radio chatter]

388
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:16,569
What the hell happened?

389
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:19,114
I don't know,
but I got dibs on the boots.

390
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,411
I got a couple of questions.

391
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:28,665
Bernice.

392
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:32,460
I know it's been a long night,
we're almost done.

393
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,088
How are you feeling, Kelly?

394
00:22:35,797 --> 00:22:36,756
I feel fine.

395
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:39,217
Uh, you reported
a cigarette burn?

396
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:40,552
Yeah, yeah.

397
00:22:40,802 --> 00:22:42,385
It burnt a hole right on
his chest, right here.

398
00:22:42,387 --> 00:22:43,805
[ominous music]

399
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,308
[cop] Looks like you're okay.

400
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,395
Look, either way,

401
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:53,398
we're sorry that Pflueger
was conning you

402
00:22:53,648 --> 00:22:55,191
into the whole healing thing.

403
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:56,276
Mm.

[tense music]

405
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:00,280
Okay.

406
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:03,908
Look, if you need anything,
don't hesitate to call.

407
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:05,410
Thank you, Sheriff Adler.

408
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:07,036
Appreciate that, thank you.

[music continues]

410
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:14,127

00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:36,191
That is so cool.

415
00:23:37,192 --> 00:23:38,234
I'm so tired.

416
00:23:38,735 --> 00:23:40,278
I barely slept at
all last night.

417
00:23:42,363 --> 00:23:43,323
I slept great.

418
00:23:43,782 --> 00:23:45,033
Hug me before work.

419
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:48,870
[laughing]

420
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:56,211
Something awesome happened to me

421
00:23:56,503 --> 00:23:57,295
after Pflueger healed me.

422
00:23:59,005 --> 00:23:59,964
Look.

423
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,925
Why are you flipping me off?

424
00:24:02,383 --> 00:24:04,928
I cut it.
And... and then boom, it healed.

425
00:24:05,553 --> 00:24:06,513
And it didn't even hurt.

426
00:24:07,972 --> 00:24:08,932
What are you talking about?

427
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:10,391
It healed.

428
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,310
Ju... just like the cigarette
burn on my chest.

429
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:14,521
Can I have some of that?

430
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:16,147
Sure.

431
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,526
Well, that's a good sign.

432
00:24:20,568 --> 00:24:21,528
What?

433
00:24:21,778 --> 00:24:23,696
You drank the soda
instead of eating the can.

434
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:26,658
Invincible.

435
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:29,452
I'm invincible.

436
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:30,912
You must be contagious.

437
00:24:32,664 --> 00:24:33,373
Now I feel great.

438
00:24:33,623 --> 00:24:34,666

442
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:35,810
[Dominique] Hey, Kelly.

443
00:25:36,644 --> 00:25:37,437
Bike problems?

444
00:25:38,438 --> 00:25:39,397
Just an old chain.

445
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:40,732
Yeah, I think you
outgrew that bike

446
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,066
like 10 years ago.

447
00:25:43,818 --> 00:25:45,820
My God, Kelly. Last time I saw you
you were just skin and bones.

448
00:25:46,738 --> 00:25:48,823
Did you take some
sort of miracle pill

449
00:25:49,073 --> 00:25:50,074
while you were home sick?

450
00:25:51,451 --> 00:25:53,453
You do look different.

451
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:55,578
- [phone ringing]
- Um, Dom,

452
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,539
I'll wait for you in the car.

453
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:58,875
Bye.

454
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:02,921
So...

455
00:26:03,546 --> 00:26:04,505
Um...

456
00:26:05,924 --> 00:26:06,883
I, um, I heard about that
guy dying at your place,

457
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,092
that must've been scary.

458
00:26:09,218 --> 00:26:10,762
That was super weird.

459
00:26:12,472 --> 00:26:13,431
But he did...

460
00:26:16,726 --> 00:26:18,519
Something good came of it, it...

461
00:26:19,687 --> 00:26:20,647
it's like I'm a new Kelly.

462
00:26:21,856 --> 00:26:23,566
Well, I like this new Kelly.

463
00:26:24,776 --> 00:26:25,735
[car horn honking]

464
00:26:27,737 --> 00:26:28,696
Bye.

465
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:30,615
Bye. [chuckling]

466
00:26:38,748 --> 00:26:40,458
[engine starting]

467
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,127
You think you have a chance
with her, Trash Boy?

468
00:26:43,628 --> 00:26:45,296
She deserves anybody
but your brother.

469
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:47,382
What'd you say, freak?

470
00:26:47,715 --> 00:26:49,300
[tense music]

471
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:51,135
You can't hurt me.

472
00:26:52,804 --> 00:26:54,681
Oh, I bet I can, Trash Boy.

475
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:01,813
Nope.

476
00:27:02,063 --> 00:27:03,022
I didn't feel it.

477
00:27:06,484 --> 00:27:07,485
- [groaning]
- [ominous whooshing]

[groaning]

479
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,489
Amazing.

480
00:27:11,656 --> 00:27:13,157
Are you done hurting me?

481
00:27:13,574 --> 00:27:15,284
I'm not sure
you can take much more.

482
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:19,539
[ominous whooshing]

483

484
00:27:23,418 --> 00:27:24,711
Strike three, you're out!

485
00:27:25,503 --> 00:27:26,462
[boy] Get away from me!

486
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:27,547
Fucking monster!

487
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:32,635
Feel free to beat me up anytime!

488
00:27:32,844 --> 00:27:33,803
[laughing]

489
00:27:40,518 --> 00:27:43,104
[soft guitar music]

490
00:27:54,115 --> 00:27:55,074
Mom!

491
00:27:55,366 --> 00:27:56,534
I got a job
at the pizza place today.

492
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,659
That's amazing!

493
00:27:58,661 --> 00:28:00,079
I'm so proud of you.

494
00:28:00,872 --> 00:28:01,914
I was thinking maybe
I could finally get

495
00:28:02,165 --> 00:28:03,666
a... a cell phone or a new bike,

496
00:28:03,875 --> 00:28:05,418
or maybe even a car.

497
00:28:06,002 --> 00:28:07,587
[pounding on door]

498
00:28:08,421 --> 00:28:09,672
Who knocks like that?

499
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:12,633
Stay by the truck, please.

500
00:28:13,009 --> 00:28:14,177
- Hi.
- Hi.

501
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:17,555
Sorry to barge in on you
so late, Miss Mason.

502
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:19,557
I'm, uh, Gus Whitcomb.

503
00:28:19,807 --> 00:28:21,851
I'm the football
coach at Stinson High.

504
00:28:22,143 --> 00:28:23,728
Oh. Call me Bernice, please.

505
00:28:24,896 --> 00:28:26,189
Okay, Bernice. Um...

506
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:27,982
Yeah, so, the reason I'm here,

507
00:28:29,484 --> 00:28:32,945
my... my son, Reed, he was
attacked before school today.

508
00:28:33,613 --> 00:28:34,614
Oh, that's horrible,
I'm so sorry.

509
00:28:34,864 --> 00:28:38,367
Yeah, well, it's a...
it's a strange situation.

510
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,869
Um...

511
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,372
Reed says that Kelly was there.

512
00:28:45,374 --> 00:28:46,334
Kelly?

513
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:48,169
Hey, honey.
Do you know anything about this?

514
00:28:48,628 --> 00:28:51,798
Reed was trying to beat me up,
and well, he hurt himself instead.

515
00:28:52,173 --> 00:28:54,425
He hurt him... self?

516
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:56,677
See, that just doesn't
make any sense.

517
00:28:56,928 --> 00:28:57,720
Reed always picks on me.

518
00:28:58,054 --> 00:28:59,180
No, I know that, but I mean...

519
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:00,598
What? Wait, wait, wait.

520
00:29:00,848 --> 00:29:02,683
You know your son
bullies my son?

521
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:03,935
Have you tried to stop him?

522
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:05,853
Why? Boys will be boys.

523
00:29:06,813 --> 00:29:07,772
What the fuck does that mean?

524
00:29:08,439 --> 00:29:09,398
Bernice, please, I just...

525
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,819
No, that's Miss Mason to you
actually, Coach Whitcomb.

526
00:29:13,027 --> 00:29:15,071
Okay, back to that.
Miss Mason.

527
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:18,616
Um... I just want to know
what your son knows, that's it.

528
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:20,451
Kelly, how did Reed get hurt?

529
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,497
I didn't beat him up if
that's what he's telling you.

530
00:29:24,914 --> 00:29:27,291
No, I know... that.

531
00:29:27,542 --> 00:29:28,751
I know there's no chance

532
00:29:29,627 --> 00:29:31,629
of you beating up my boy,
God no. I just...

533
00:29:32,588 --> 00:29:33,798
He didn't do that
to himself, did he?

534
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,716
Look, you may not
believe your son,

535
00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:37,385
but I believe mine.

536
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:39,095
Well, something's going on here!

537
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:40,930
Right. Kelly's told you
everything he knows.

538
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:42,473
- Goodnight.
- [Gus] Wha...

539
00:29:42,849 --> 00:29:43,808
[door slams]

540
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:46,644
You didn't hurt that boy, right?

541
00:29:47,145 --> 00:29:49,272
That's the other Pflueger thing
I was gonna tell you about.

542
00:29:50,314 --> 00:29:51,772
But it's easier to show you.

543
00:29:51,774 --> 00:29:52,733
So slap me.

544

00:38:28,374 --> 00:38:30,000
- Dude, dude, dude!
- Whoa, Brad, whoa, Brad!

725
00:38:32,836 --> 00:38:34,755
[engine roaring]

726
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:38,842
[laughing]

727
00:38:39,968 --> 00:38:40,928
Rev it up, bro.

728
00:38:41,136 --> 00:38:42,805
- [engine revving]
- [indistinct chattering]

729
00:38:46,433 --> 00:38:48,560
[boys shouting]

730
00:38:48,811 --> 00:38:50,396
Wooo!

731
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:55,776
Pedal, boy, pedal!

732
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,861
[music continues]

733
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,783
- [grunting]
- Oh, shit!

734
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:06,412
- [demonic roar]
- [tires screeching]

735
00:39:06,787 --> 00:39:07,746
Ah, fuck!

736
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:16,171
[boys groaning]

737
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:17,881
Oh, man.

738
00:39:18,132 --> 00:39:19,383
- [Tucker] You all right, man?
- Yeah, I'm good.

739
00:39:19,717 --> 00:39:21,260
- [dramatic music]
- Oh, shit.

740
00:39:21,635 --> 00:39:23,303
- Brad.
- What?

741
00:39:23,554 --> 00:39:24,263
- Brad.
- Oh...

742
00:39:24,513 --> 00:39:25,681
Hey, buddy.

743
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:27,099
[Tucker] Shit!

744
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,643
[ominous music]

745
00:39:29,893 --> 00:39:31,311
What the fuck?

746
00:39:31,603 --> 00:39:33,230
- Dude.
- [gurgling]

747
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,232
Brad. Shit, bro.

748
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:37,276
Hey, we're gonna get
you some help, man.

749
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:40,070
Get the fuck out of the car!

750
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,239
Get me outta here.
Come on, get out!

751
00:39:42,489 --> 00:39:45,284
[gasping, coughing]

752
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:48,454
[Tucker] Did you see his face?
He's not breathing.

753
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:50,456
[Tony] Call 911.
Call 911.

754
00:39:50,706 --> 00:39:52,040
[Tucker] My phone's in the car,
it's under Brad's seat.

755
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:53,250
[Tony] Tucker. Tucker!

756
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,460
Bro!

757
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:56,462
Fuck!

758
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:00,090
Oh, shit, bro, Kelly.

759
00:40:02,384 --> 00:40:03,425
I thought Brad ran him over.

760
00:40:03,427 --> 00:40:04,636
My fuckin' brother was right.

761
00:40:05,512 --> 00:40:07,431
Why couldn't you all
just leave me alone?

762
00:40:08,182 --> 00:40:09,349
Look what you've done!

763
00:40:10,517 --> 00:40:11,685
[panting]

764
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:16,940
[ominous music]

765
00:40:23,155 --> 00:40:24,490
[owl hoots]

766
00:40:29,578 --> 00:40:31,163
[crickets chirping]

767
00:40:33,457 --> 00:40:35,167
[eerie music]

768
00:40:46,345 --> 00:40:47,513
That's Brad's car!

769
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:53,477
[dramatic music]

770
00:40:53,811 --> 00:40:54,853
Oh, my God!

771
00:40:55,103 --> 00:40:56,104
Where's Tony?

772
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,901
They took off down the road,
after they hit me.

773
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:02,110
Are you hurt?

774
00:41:02,569 --> 00:41:03,612
[mumbling indistinctly]

775
00:41:03,904 --> 00:41:04,905
[Dominique] What happened?

776
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:06,488
I was riding my bike home

777
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,658
and they came after
me in Brad's car.

778
00:41:08,742 --> 00:41:10,369
They ran you over with the car?

779
00:41:12,621 --> 00:41:14,540
[Sarah whimpering]

780
00:41:17,251 --> 00:41:19,002
That's why I brought 'em out as
soon as they came to the house,

781
00:41:19,253 --> 00:41:20,546
because they... they were
in shock,

782
00:41:20,796 --> 00:41:22,923
talking all this nonsense.

783
00:41:23,173 --> 00:41:24,341
[sobbing]

784
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,511
- Where's Kelly?
- Bernice, Kelly seems to be okay.

785
00:41:27,761 --> 00:41:29,555
- He's over here.
- Oh, my God.

786
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,348
Oh, my God, are you okay?

787
00:41:31,682 --> 00:41:33,934
No one talks any of
that horseshit nonsense.

788
00:41:34,184 --> 00:41:35,727
- You got it?
- Okay.

789
00:41:35,978 --> 00:41:37,145
I haven't talked to Kelly yet,

790
00:41:37,396 --> 00:41:39,521
so please don't go anywhere
until I release him.

791
00:41:39,523 --> 00:41:40,482
[Bernice] Okay.

792
00:41:40,732 --> 00:41:41,942
Kelly, what happened?

793
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,402
Brad and those guys
ran me over with their car.

794
00:41:43,861 --> 00:41:45,404
All the wounds transferred
to Brad and killed him.

795
00:41:46,154 --> 00:41:47,447
We're supposed to
keep that between us.

796
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,158
I won't tell anybody, I promise.

797
00:41:53,203 --> 00:41:54,162
Tell him what happened.

798
00:41:55,497 --> 00:41:57,249
Kelly wa... uh,
Kelly was riding his bike

799
00:41:57,499 --> 00:41:58,582
in the middle of the road,

800
00:41:58,584 --> 00:42:00,586
and then Brad swerved
to avoid hitting him

801
00:42:00,836 --> 00:42:02,421
and, uh, lost control
and wrecked.

802
00:42:03,171 --> 00:42:04,756
The airbag blew up
in his face and killed him.

803
00:42:05,299 --> 00:42:08,427
[Adler] So Kelly purposefully pulled
himself in front of the car?

804
00:42:08,677 --> 00:42:10,345
Almost like he was daring us to.

805
00:42:11,179 --> 00:42:12,514
Tucker, what'd you see?

806
00:42:12,723 --> 00:42:14,933
Dumbass was riding his bike
in the middle of the road.

807
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,607
There's no way
you can tell the truth.

808
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:23,066
Your mom's right.

809
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,612
Okay, so...

810
00:42:28,655 --> 00:42:30,407
I got thrown off my bike
and in the bushes.

811
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:32,576
It's a miracle
I didn't get hurt.

812
00:42:35,746 --> 00:42:37,122
I got dibs on the car.

813
00:42:38,665 --> 00:42:39,625
[bird squawks]

814
00:42:39,875 --> 00:42:42,419
[tense music]

815
00:43:23,669 --> 00:43:25,671
And then you'll
destroy yourself.

816
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:28,840
The whole town knows
about your accident.

817
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:30,842
Let's hope that
the cops stick with

818
00:43:31,093 --> 00:43:32,469
the airbag malfunction theory.

819
00:43:35,472 --> 00:43:37,599
Yo. Bros, we gotta do
something about that.

820
00:43:38,058 --> 00:43:39,518
Not me, I have no
death wish, bro.

821
00:43:40,852 --> 00:43:43,271
Hey. You're either with us
or against us.

822
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,731
So make up your mind, dildo.

823
00:43:44,982 --> 00:43:46,525
Grow some balls, man.

824
00:43:46,775 --> 00:43:47,734
Yeah, like Brad?

825
00:43:48,986 --> 00:43:50,487
- Geez.
- Come on, man.

826
00:43:51,905 --> 00:43:52,864
Is that your lunch?

827
00:43:53,782 --> 00:43:55,534
Yeah.
I love rice cakes.

828
00:43:55,784 --> 00:43:57,494
Those things taste
like styrofoam.

829
00:43:59,538 --> 00:44:00,497
You want one?

830
00:44:02,332 --> 00:44:04,793
Well, they are on
my diet plan, so...

831
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:09,923
Oh, pass the peanut butter.

832
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:23,729
[Nelson] I have a plan.

833
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,690
Tonight, Trash Family begins
their journey out of trailer town.

834
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,692
[boys laughing]

835
00:44:32,779 --> 00:44:33,947
I don't like all the attention.

836
00:44:34,698 --> 00:44:36,158
I just want things
to go back to normal.

837
00:44:36,867 --> 00:44:38,201
Normal? You?

838
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,621
[laughing]

839
00:44:43,957 --> 00:44:45,542
They're gonna forget
about this soon.

840
00:44:46,835 --> 00:44:47,878
Just stick with me, okay?

841
00:44:51,298 --> 00:44:52,924
Dude, there's so many
other girls at this school.

842
00:44:53,175 --> 00:44:54,593
Just let Kelly have Dominique.

843
00:44:55,385 --> 00:44:57,220
Bro, this isn't about Dominique,

844
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,556
it's a tribute to Brad, asshole.

845
00:45:01,808 --> 00:45:03,351
Hey, um, you know the new
<i>Halloween</i> is out.

846
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:06,021
Oh, yeah! I was really wanting
to see that one.

847
00:45:07,397 --> 00:45:08,356
Yeah.

848
00:45:11,693 --> 00:45:14,237
Um, are you... are you doing
anything this week?

849
00:45:16,073 --> 00:45:17,032
I don't think so.

850
00:45:17,491 --> 00:45:18,740
No, I think I'm...

851
00:45:18,742 --> 00:45:19,826
Yeah, you know, school stuff.

852
00:45:20,077 --> 00:45:21,036
[chuckles]

853
00:45:25,248 --> 00:45:27,334
Okay.
Well, I better get to class.

854
00:45:27,542 --> 00:45:28,835
- So...
- Okay.

855
00:45:29,086 --> 00:45:30,794
- Talk later?
- Yeah.

856
00:45:30,796 --> 00:45:31,755
I'll talk to you later.

857
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:36,426
Really, that's... that's it?

858
00:45:39,429 --> 00:45:40,847
Oh. Um...

859
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,058
Want to go to the movies Friday

860
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:45,185
and check out that
new <i>Halloween</i> movie?

861
00:45:45,435 --> 00:45:47,769
- Yes, okay.
- Okay. [laughing]

862
00:45:47,771 --> 00:45:49,481
- Okay, all right.
- All right.

863
00:45:49,898 --> 00:45:51,566
- I'll see you Friday.
- Friday.

864
00:45:51,817 --> 00:45:53,068
- Okay, bye.
- All right, bye.

865
00:45:56,279 --> 00:45:57,239
[chuckles]

866
00:45:59,991 --> 00:46:00,992
[laughs]

867
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,248
[indistinct chattering]

868
00:46:06,498 --> 00:46:08,250
[soft music playing]

869
00:46:12,587 --> 00:46:14,297
Yo. Shifts up.

870
00:46:14,548 --> 00:46:15,507
I got this.

871
00:46:16,508 --> 00:46:17,467
See ya, bro.

872
00:46:17,801 --> 00:46:20,303
Ow! God! That's really hot.

873
00:46:20,762 --> 00:46:22,097
- So sorry.
- Just...

874
00:46:22,973 --> 00:46:23,682
Go, go.

875
00:46:28,061 --> 00:46:29,479
Don't forget the trash.

876
00:46:32,315 --> 00:46:34,693
[dog barking]

877
00:46:42,701 --> 00:46:43,994
[Red Elk] Are you Kelly Mason?

878
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:45,829
[ominous music]

879
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:53,128
- Yeah.
- Are you the kid who got hit by the car?

880
00:46:54,337 --> 00:46:55,297
Yeah.

881
00:46:55,797 --> 00:46:56,798
Strange.

882
00:46:57,591 --> 00:46:59,259
You don't look like
you got hurt at all.

883
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:02,679
I was very lucky.

884
00:47:03,513 --> 00:47:04,472
A bush broke my fall.

885
00:47:05,557 --> 00:47:06,683
You knew Pflueger.

886
00:47:09,102 --> 00:47:10,437
The Reverend came to my trailer

887
00:47:10,937 --> 00:47:13,190
and helped me when I was sick,
and then he died, that's all.

888
00:47:13,732 --> 00:47:16,067
[eerie music]

889
00:47:23,742 --> 00:47:25,243
[dog barking]

890
00:47:27,204 --> 00:47:28,163
Hey, Mom.

891
00:47:29,915 --> 00:47:31,915
I asked Dominique to go out
with me and guess what she said?

892
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:34,169
- What?
- She said yes, just like that.

893
00:47:34,419 --> 00:47:35,378
And boom!

894
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:38,004
We're gonna go see a movie.

895
00:47:38,006 --> 00:47:39,007
Oh, honey!

896
00:47:39,299 --> 00:47:40,592
I'm so proud of you.

897
00:47:40,842 --> 00:47:42,677
You just needed some
confidence, that's all.

898
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,639
You know, Pflueger was
a godsend, wasn't he?

899
00:47:46,014 --> 00:47:46,973
Yeah.

900
00:47:47,224 --> 00:47:48,475
I wanna give you a big
bear hug right now,

901
00:47:48,725 --> 00:47:49,684
but I don't feel so good.

902
00:47:49,935 --> 00:47:51,770

I've got a splitting headache.

- Would you?

908

[Kelly] Yeah, can
I take the car?

Let's just do this
thing already.

- What if we get caught?
- Hey, chill.

914
00:48:15,919 --> 00:48:18,171
All right?
She'll be leaving for work soon.

915
00:48:18,588 --> 00:48:19,673
And... and we're sure
Kelly's not home?

the fire did to him.

the rest of our lives

1080
00:59:14,577 --> 00:59:15,620
getting ass-fucked in jail?

1081
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,872
Dude, uh, have you had
too many concussions?

1082
00:59:18,205 --> 00:59:20,166
Guys, I told you
not to mess with him.

1083
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:22,877
- He's a freak.
- Shut the fuck up.

1084
00:59:23,127 --> 00:59:24,462
Why do I have to sit
next to this guy?

1085
00:59:24,712 --> 00:59:26,297
We're not going to the cops

1086
00:59:26,547 --> 00:59:27,882
because we had nothing to do

1087
00:59:28,341 --> 00:59:29,425
with Mama Trash getting toasted.

1088
00:59:29,675 --> 00:59:31,552
- Stop calling her that.
- [bots laughing]

1089
00:59:31,761 --> 00:59:33,220
Mama Trash, Mama Trash.

1090
00:59:33,471 --> 00:59:35,638
[Tony] Guys, guys, guys, chill.
Okay? It doesn't even matter.

1091
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,516
Trash Boy's on his way
out of town already, okay?

1092
00:59:37,767 --> 00:59:40,601
- So, case closed.
- Learn from your big bro.

1093
00:59:40,603 --> 00:59:41,812
All right,
I know how to handle shit.

1094
00:59:42,688 --> 00:59:44,607
- Yeah.
- [Reed] If you're sure.

1095
00:59:44,857 --> 00:59:45,816
And I mean like, positively...

1096
00:59:46,067 --> 00:59:47,652
Fuck yes, we're sure!

1097
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:50,488
All right? Now let's go give
Trash Boy a proper goodbye.

1098
00:59:50,738 --> 00:59:52,239
Oh, pucker up bitches,
here we go.

1099

1101
00:59:58,329 --> 00:59:59,288
So, someone did this?

- No, I'm not saying that.
- [car horn honking]

Yo. Hey, let's hit the river.

1108
01:00:16,555 --> 01:00:17,640
River boys, come on!

[Nelson, Tony, and Tucker]
River, river, river!

1110
01:00:20,601 --> 01:00:21,727
Those motherfuckers!

1111
01:00:21,978 --> 01:00:23,229
Calm down, Kelly.

1112
01:00:24,313 --> 01:00:26,689
Bad temper will only
get you into trouble.

1113
01:00:26,691 --> 01:00:27,692
Believe me.

1114
01:00:27,942 --> 01:00:29,777
[suspenseful music]

1115
01:00:30,027 --> 01:00:32,697
Don't pay attention to
those idiots, all right?

1116
01:00:34,073 --> 01:00:35,032
Kelly!

1117
01:00:35,241 --> 01:00:36,242
Kelly!

1118
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:39,078

Kelly!

1120
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,263
Dispatch.
I need an ATV...

[water rushing]

1122
01:01:05,187 --> 01:01:07,690
[ominous music]

1123
01:01:15,948 --> 01:01:18,075
- [Nelson] Woo, nice!
- [Tony] Hard to get off.

1124
01:01:18,284 --> 01:01:19,702
- It's hot.
- Nobody wants to see that.

1125
01:01:20,202 --> 01:01:22,077
You probably do.

1126
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:23,704
[Tony] You're just jealous because
your body looks like a 12 year old.

1127
01:01:23,706 --> 01:01:25,332
- [laughing]
- [Reed] That's funny.

[Tony and Tucker laughing]

1129
01:01:28,002 --> 01:01:29,462
- [Tucker] How you feelin'?
- I'm all right, I'm all right.

1130
01:01:29,754 --> 01:01:30,713
Watch out, there's
some hornets and stuff.

1131
01:01:30,963 --> 01:01:32,715
- Hornets?
- [indistinct chattering]

1132
01:01:32,965 --> 01:01:33,924

[laughing]

1134
01:01:38,429 --> 01:01:39,388
Lizard city.

[laughing]

1137
01:01:43,809 --> 01:01:46,020
- Think I'm gonna hop in.
- Oh, a little bath time?

1138
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,646
Yeah, bath time, huh.

1139
01:01:48,022 --> 01:01:50,316
[Tony] Yeah, get in there.

[laughing]

1141
01:01:53,861 --> 01:01:55,362

- You want to fuck him up?

1142
01:01:56,822 --> 01:01:57,782
Woo.

1143
01:01:59,825 --> 01:02:01,494
- [Tony] Boom!
- Five bucks you can't hit him.

1144
01:02:01,744 --> 01:02:03,037
- Chill out, you bitches.
- [Nelson] Five bucks.

1145
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:04,955
All right, who's gonna pay?

1146

- [tense music]
- [indistinct chattering]

1147

Come on.

1149
01:02:10,086 --> 01:02:11,670

01:02:22,932 --> 01:02:24,016
[Nelson] Hey, dodge this.

1153
01:02:24,266 --> 01:02:25,267
[Tucker] Hey, I'm serious, man.

1154
01:02:26,602 --> 01:02:28,604
- Stop.
- [indistinct chattering]

1155

[Tucker] Chill, stop!

1156
01:02:31,649 --> 01:02:32,817

gotta be able to hit him.

1159
01:02:38,197 --> 01:02:39,865
Hey, this is for being
a pussy in trailer town.

1160
01:02:40,116 --> 01:02:42,076
- [Nelson] Boom!
- Hey, watch it.

1161
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:44,743
- Guys, stop.
- That's for hopping in the car

1162
01:02:44,745 --> 01:02:45,913
when Trash Boy came.

1163
01:02:46,163 --> 01:02:47,665

1164
01:02:51,293 --> 01:02:52,628

[music continues]

1172

Tucker.

[Kelly choking]

1174
01:03:42,094 --> 01:03:43,679
[Nelson] Man!
Hey, stop messing around!

1175
01:03:46,098 --> 01:03:47,057
Tucker.

1176
01:03:47,892 --> 01:03:48,809
Shit.

Yo!

1180
01:03:59,778 --> 01:04:01,864
Call the cops, bro.
Yo, come on. Tony!

1181
01:04:02,823 --> 01:04:04,116
- Tony, help.
- [Tony] Put him down, put him down.

1182
01:04:04,366 --> 01:04:05,326
Fuck.

1183
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:06,869
Wake up.

Tucker!

1185
01:04:10,456 --> 01:04:11,457
Wake up!

[coughing]

1187
01:04:15,169 --> 01:04:16,420
[Tony] Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

1188
01:04:16,712 --> 01:04:17,671
Wake up!

1189
01:04:19,298 --> 01:04:21,300
- Do CPR, dude.
- Bro, I don't... I don't know CPR, you do it.

1190
01:04:21,675 --> 01:04:23,636
[indistinct chattering]

1191
01:04:26,513 --> 01:04:27,473
One bully down.

1192
01:04:28,682 --> 01:04:29,683
Three to go.

1193
01:04:32,186 --> 01:04:33,145
Who's next?

1194
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:34,480
Shit.

1195
01:04:44,615 --> 01:04:45,574
This must be Reed's.

1196
01:04:47,868 --> 01:04:48,827
He's spared.

1197
01:04:53,999 --> 01:04:54,750
[Adler in distance]
Nelson. Nelson.

1198
01:04:56,126 --> 01:04:57,086
[echoing] What's going on?

1199
01:04:59,797 --> 01:05:00,756
Saved by the calvary.

1200
01:05:02,675 --> 01:05:03,634
For now.

1201
01:05:06,804 --> 01:05:07,763
What just happened?

1202
01:05:08,013 --> 01:05:09,598
Trash Boy just fucked
Tucker's shit up.

1203
01:05:11,225 --> 01:05:12,184
Don't know how.

1204
01:05:12,643 --> 01:05:13,852
But we're gonna kill that freak.

1205
01:05:17,481 --> 01:05:19,233
[zipper zips]

1206
01:05:23,612 --> 01:05:24,989
One, two... [grunts]

1207
01:05:26,115 --> 01:05:26,824
I'm telling you, all right?

1208
01:05:27,074 --> 01:05:28,492
Kelly was standing right there.

1209
01:05:29,785 --> 01:05:31,662
We... we saw him in the car
with you.

1210
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:34,415
I... I don't know how,
but it's Kelly's fault.

1211
01:05:35,124 --> 01:05:36,999
Trash Boy like... drowned him

1212
01:05:37,001 --> 01:05:37,960
and then ran up the river.

1213
01:05:38,419 --> 01:05:39,795
Yeah, like a fucking coward.

1214
01:05:42,965 --> 01:05:44,425
Reed said that you
were throwing rocks.

1215
01:05:44,675 --> 01:05:45,676
Did you hit Tucker?

1216
01:05:46,218 --> 01:05:47,386
We didn't do this to Tucker.

1217
01:05:47,803 --> 01:05:48,762
Did you?

1218
01:05:49,013 --> 01:05:50,597
He was our friend,
why would we do that?

1219
01:05:51,348 --> 01:05:52,891
You boys are lying
about something.

1220
01:05:55,477 --> 01:05:56,979
Just remember that
was your friend

1221
01:05:57,229 --> 01:05:58,188
in that body bag.

1222
01:06:04,236 --> 01:06:05,863
Having a hard time with this.

1223
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,030
I've known Kelly forever
and I just can't believe

1224
01:06:08,032 --> 01:06:09,199
that he could hurt anyone.

1225
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,909
<i>Well, Tony said he was there</i>

1226
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,161
and saw the whole thing.

1227
01:06:12,828 --> 01:06:14,246

1232
01:06:38,062 --> 01:06:39,021
Jesus!

1233
01:06:40,105 --> 01:06:40,856
I'm sorry, honey.

1234
01:06:41,732 --> 01:06:42,691
Dinner's ready.

1235
01:06:43,233 --> 01:06:44,276
I'm skipping dinner.

1236
01:06:49,698 --> 01:06:50,908
You must keep this
window closed,

1237
01:06:51,158 --> 01:06:52,117
it is not safe.

1238
01:06:52,368 --> 01:06:53,869
Especially with Kelly out there.

1239
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:56,163
[dog barking]

1240
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:00,501
- Are you sure you're not hungry?
- Mom, I can't eat.

1241
01:07:01,794 --> 01:07:03,295
Okay, goodnight.

- Boo!
- [gasps]

1244
01:07:21,063 --> 01:07:22,064
Not funny.

1245
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:24,441
Sorry.

1246
01:07:25,025 --> 01:07:26,318
What happened at
the river with Tucker?

1247
01:07:30,656 --> 01:07:31,657
Come with me.

1248
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:33,909
I want to tell you everything.

You can't go through with this.

1252
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,260

01:16:42,666 --> 01:16:44,626
in the back of your
dad's pickup truck.

1428
01:16:44,876 --> 01:16:47,045
[Gus] Those are my chains.
I put them in there last night.

1429
01:16:47,837 --> 01:16:48,797
Why?

1430
01:16:49,631 --> 01:16:51,341
[Adler] Is there anything
you want to tell me?

1431
01:16:52,676 --> 01:16:54,427
Nah. I don't know what
you're talking about, Sheriff.

1432
01:16:55,762 --> 01:16:56,513
What about you, Reed?

1433
01:16:58,306 --> 01:16:59,641
I had nothing to
do with nothing.

1434
01:17:00,141 --> 01:17:01,476
Well, there you go.

1435
01:17:02,686 --> 01:17:03,687
Glad we cleared that up.

1436
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:06,272
Thanks for coming by.

1437
01:17:06,773 --> 01:17:07,482
[Kelly] Check it out, guys.

1438
01:17:09,693 --> 01:17:10,652
It's the walking
garbage disposal.

1439
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,368
[dramatic music]

1440
01:17:18,827 --> 01:17:19,869
So fucking gross.

1441
01:17:21,746 --> 01:17:22,706
But it'll be worth it.

1442
01:17:24,499 --> 01:17:26,334
- [drill whirs]
- Now who's ready?

1443
01:17:26,584 --> 01:17:29,254
Look, Kelly, I had nothing to do
with your mother's death, I swear.

1444
01:17:31,715 --> 01:17:32,630
Reed, where the hell
are you going?

1445
01:17:32,632 --> 01:17:34,009
Reed, get back here!

1446
01:17:36,594 --> 01:17:38,638
I like Reed.
Never thought I'd say that.

1447
01:17:40,849 --> 01:17:41,766
Hey, I'm ready, Trash Boy.

1448
01:17:42,017 --> 01:17:43,143
[tense music]

1449
01:17:48,815 --> 01:17:50,692
Kelly, don't listen to him.

1450
01:17:50,942 --> 01:17:51,985
I can help you.

1451
01:17:52,235 --> 01:17:53,194
I won't ask again!

1452
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,532
What are you waiting for, bud?
Arrest his ass.

1453
01:17:58,491 --> 01:17:59,909
[music continues]

1454
01:18:03,788 --> 01:18:05,582
- [drill whirring]
- [groaning]

1455
01:18:06,332 --> 01:18:08,710
[Nelson screaming]

1456
01:18:13,465 --> 01:18:14,632
Drop that drill, Kelly.

1457
01:18:14,883 --> 01:18:15,925
Not until he confesses!

1458
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:17,761
You know what you did!

1459
01:18:18,011 --> 01:18:19,512
Nelson, you stubborn bastard!

1460
01:18:19,763 --> 01:18:20,597
[groaning]

1461
01:18:21,639 --> 01:18:23,767
- [screaming]
- Fuck is this?

1462
01:18:24,768 --> 01:18:25,727
Boys will be boys.

1463
01:18:26,895 --> 01:18:28,063
[Nelson groaning]

1464
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,439
Fuck this!

1465
01:18:30,315 --> 01:18:32,150
Come on, shoot him, God damn it!

1466
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,568
I can handle this!

1467
01:18:34,652 --> 01:18:35,612
Kelly!

1468
01:18:35,904 --> 01:18:37,572
I know Nelson was involved.

1469
01:18:37,989 --> 01:18:39,824
I found the chain
he used on your trailer,

1470
01:18:40,075 --> 01:18:41,701
but you have to stop this.

1471
01:18:42,285 --> 01:18:43,411
This is not you.

1472
01:18:45,955 --> 01:18:48,166
I know Pflueger gave you
those powers.

1473
01:18:49,292 --> 01:18:50,251
What do you know about that?

1474
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:52,212
[Adler] What I know is
they're not yours.

1475
01:18:52,837 --> 01:18:54,714
They haven't been used
for a hundred years.

1476
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:57,217
That medicine is very dangerous.

1477
01:18:57,467 --> 01:18:59,385
- This is fuckin' bullshit, man!
- [Nelson screaming]

1478
01:18:59,677 --> 01:19:00,970
[Gus]
Look what he's doing to my son!

1479
01:19:02,889 --> 01:19:03,640
Kelly, stop!

1480
01:19:06,184 --> 01:19:07,143
[screaming]

1481
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:09,729
Fuck this!

1482
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:12,857
[groaning]

1483
01:19:13,108 --> 01:19:14,067
You okay?

1484
01:19:14,317 --> 01:19:16,569
[grunting]

1485
01:19:18,321 --> 01:19:20,031
[panting]

1486
01:19:24,035 --> 01:19:25,662
[gasping]

1487
01:19:26,121 --> 01:19:28,081
Take that, you son
of a dead bitch!

1488
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:32,252
[groaning]

1489
01:19:35,004 --> 01:19:36,297
What the hell is he?

1490
01:19:40,593 --> 01:19:42,011
Shoot him now, he's weak!

1491
01:19:44,889 --> 01:19:47,725
Back up, bud. I don't want
to hurt you. Get away.

1492
01:19:47,976 --> 01:19:49,227
- Don't do...
- Get the fuck away.

1493
01:19:50,478 --> 01:19:52,021
[demonic whooshing]

1494
01:19:56,276 --> 01:19:57,235
This ends now.

1495
01:19:58,528 --> 01:19:59,696
Nelson killed my mom.

1496
01:20:00,905 --> 01:20:02,574
He and Tony burned
her alive in our home.

1497
01:20:03,783 --> 01:20:04,866
What is wrong with you?

1498
01:20:04,868 --> 01:20:06,161
What's wrong with all of you?

1499
01:20:06,953 --> 01:20:08,496
- Goodbye, freak.
- Don't shoot!

1500
01:20:08,746 --> 01:20:10,331
[gun fires]

1501
01:20:13,084 --> 01:20:14,419
[dark demonic screeching]

1502
01:20:15,336 --> 01:20:16,880
[grunting]

1503
01:20:17,922 --> 01:20:20,550
- Man, that itches.
- Kelly, look what you've done!

1504
01:20:20,967 --> 01:20:22,093
What... look what I've done?

1505
01:20:23,011 --> 01:20:23,803
This was their doing.

1506
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:25,763
They're dead because of you!

1507
01:20:26,014 --> 01:20:28,308
No, I didn't kill anyone,
Gus chose to pull that trigger.

1508
01:20:29,642 --> 01:20:31,352
So this is what your mom
would've wanted?

1509
01:20:31,978 --> 01:20:32,896
Would she be proud of you?

1510
01:20:33,938 --> 01:20:34,939
You know, I really
liked the old Kelly,

1511
01:20:35,190 --> 01:20:36,774
not this new Kelly.

1512
01:20:37,317 --> 01:20:39,861
I want you... to like me.

1513
01:20:40,945 --> 01:20:41,821
It's all I've ever wanted.

1514
01:20:42,614 --> 01:20:45,907
I don't like you, Kelly.
Not anymore.

1515
01:20:45,909 --> 01:20:47,744
- [somber music]
- [breathing shakily]

1516
01:20:50,038 --> 01:20:51,831
[Adler] Kelly. Red Elk and I,

1517
01:20:53,625 --> 01:20:56,000
we can help you bring back
the old Kelly.

1518
01:20:56,002 --> 01:20:58,129
I don't want to
be the old Kelly.

1519
01:20:58,713 --> 01:21:00,922
Weak and... and powerless,
the one everyone shits on!

1520
01:21:00,924 --> 01:21:02,133
You can't have me
and have the powers!

1521
01:21:02,383 --> 01:21:03,384
No, that's not fair!

1522
01:21:03,885 --> 01:21:05,303
How do you expect
me to give this up?

1523
01:21:05,595 --> 01:21:06,721
I can control it, I promise.

1524
01:21:07,347 --> 01:21:08,306
[Adler] You can't.

1525
01:21:09,307 --> 01:21:10,266
No one can.

1526
01:21:12,352 --> 01:21:13,895
[Dominique]
Kelly, if you ever cared for me,

1527
01:21:14,145 --> 01:21:15,980
give these powers
back to Red Elk.

1528
01:21:16,773 --> 01:21:17,732
Cared for you?

1529
01:21:19,943 --> 01:21:20,902
I love you.

1530
01:21:24,572 --> 01:21:25,949
[tense music]

1531
01:21:29,953 --> 01:21:30,954
[Adler] Drop the gun.

1532
01:21:33,373 --> 01:21:34,332
Drop the gun.

1533
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:37,835
- That won't solve anything.
- [sniffles]

1534
01:21:38,086 --> 01:21:38,878
[Adler] Just come with me.

1535
01:21:40,004 --> 01:21:41,547
[music continues]

1536
01:21:41,798 --> 01:21:42,799
[sighs]

1537
01:21:43,591 --> 01:21:46,344
- [dramatic music]
- [Red Elk chanting]

1538
01:22:06,072 --> 01:22:07,824
[thunder rumbles]

1539
01:22:08,992 --> 01:22:10,994
[music continues]

1540
01:22:15,081 --> 01:22:16,582
[thunder rumbles]

1541
01:22:26,009 --> 01:22:27,844
Kelly. Kelly, listen to me.

1542
01:22:28,469 --> 01:22:30,346
Red Elk is gonna make
you my Kelly again, okay?

1543
01:22:31,014 --> 01:22:32,972
Okay? And then we're gonna make
you stronger than ever together,

1544
01:22:32,974 --> 01:22:33,933
I promise.

1545
01:22:36,978 --> 01:22:38,271
[soft demonic screeching]

1546
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:39,856
- [thunder rumbles]
- You owe me a movie.

1547
01:22:41,065 --> 01:22:42,025
Yeah.

1548
01:22:42,233 --> 01:22:43,192
Yeah, I do.

1549
01:22:44,068 --> 01:22:46,321
- [thunder cracks]
- [chanting]

1550
01:22:55,997 --> 01:22:56,998
That one's our killer, right?

1551
01:22:57,248 --> 01:22:58,666
I don't know why he hasn't
called for backup.

1552
01:22:58,916 --> 01:23:00,043
Well, I got my
backup right here.

1553
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:03,880
- Let's go.
- [gun cocks]

1554
01:23:04,130 --> 01:23:05,089
I don't know.

1555
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:08,634
[tense music]

1556
01:23:08,885 --> 01:23:10,051
[chanting]

1557
01:23:10,053 --> 01:23:11,637
[thunder cracks]

1558
01:23:16,059 --> 01:23:16,893
Is it working?

1559
01:23:21,314 --> 01:23:22,273
Hurry!

1560
01:23:23,524 --> 01:23:24,484
What the hell?

1561
01:23:24,901 --> 01:23:26,527
[Dominique] Kelly,
let it go, let it go!

1562
01:23:26,778 --> 01:23:29,238
Don't stop!
Soon it will be free!

1563
01:23:30,531 --> 01:23:31,491
[thunder cracks]

1564
01:23:32,283 --> 01:23:33,242
[Red Elk] Let it go!

1565
01:23:33,493 --> 01:23:34,494
- What's happening?
- [groaning]

1566
01:23:34,744 --> 01:23:35,703
Keep going!

1567
01:23:35,953 --> 01:23:37,038
- [thunder cracks]
- What's happening to him?

1568
01:23:37,497 --> 01:23:38,956
You said he'd be okay!

1569
01:23:39,248 --> 01:23:40,708
Stop it, stop it!

1570
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:42,085
You're killing him!

1571
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:44,337
[chanting]

1572
01:23:44,587 --> 01:23:47,298
Listen to me, Kelly. Kelly, when I
scream, you run as fast as you can.

1573
01:23:47,548 --> 01:23:48,508
Okay?

1574
01:23:50,009 --> 01:23:51,050
Stop it!

1575
01:23:51,052 --> 01:23:52,345
He's had it too long!

1576
01:23:52,887 --> 01:23:54,222
You said we could save him.

1577
01:23:54,472 --> 01:23:55,431
[Red Elk] It's a part of him.

1578
01:23:56,307 --> 01:23:57,266
He must die.

1579
01:23:59,143 --> 01:24:00,478
Then I will have the power.

1580
01:24:01,104 --> 01:24:02,397
I will not kill this boy.

1581
01:24:02,772 --> 01:24:04,524
We must bury him with Pflueger.

1582
01:24:06,401 --> 01:24:07,485
I can save him.

1583
01:24:08,986 --> 01:24:09,904
[intense music]

1584
01:24:12,365 --> 01:24:13,699
[Dominique] Run, Kelly, run!

1585
01:24:14,617 --> 01:24:15,576
[cop] Freeze, pull it!

1586
01:24:16,411 --> 01:24:17,370
- [Adler] Wait, wait!
- [gun firing]

1587
01:24:19,789 --> 01:24:21,165

[thunder rumbling]

1590
01:24:37,014 --> 01:24:38,933
No. No, no, no.

1591
01:24:39,183 --> 01:24:41,142
No, no, Dominique, no, no, no.

1592
01:24:41,144 --> 01:24:42,895
Stay with me. Please stay.

1593
01:24:44,188 --> 01:24:45,148
[Dominique whimpering]

1594
01:24:46,649 --> 01:24:48,109
I'm sorry I made you come here.

1595
01:24:48,901 --> 01:24:49,944
It's okay, I...

1596
01:24:50,194 --> 01:24:51,320
I would do anything for you.

1597
01:24:52,196 --> 01:24:53,865
[somber music]

1598
01:24:54,157 --> 01:24:55,700
[soft demonic screeching]

1599
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:00,329
Then don't give them the power.

1600
01:25:01,205 --> 01:25:02,165
I won't.

1601
01:25:05,585 --> 01:25:06,544
I love you.

1602
01:25:08,254 --> 01:25:09,213
I always will.
