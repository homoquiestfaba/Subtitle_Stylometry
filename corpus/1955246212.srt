00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,466
You know,
I realize I haven't kept you

3
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,435
up to speed...
on everything,

4
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:04,132
but, uh, the situation
on the ground

5
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:07,142
has, uh, changed, hasn't it?

6
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,609
This is the part of the story

7
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:12,239
where Dr. Frankenstein looks out
at the burning village

8
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,147
and all the dead bodies

9
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:17,050
and he thinks about his creation
and he says,

10
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,090
"What-what the fuck
was I thinking?"

11
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:24,320
How did those guys
save the world?

12
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,486
Jesus Christ.

13
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:32,295
It all started ten years ago,
the last mission.

14
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,003
Say, we got that fix, Argon.

15
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:40,270
It appears to be working now.
We're back at...

16
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:41,874
guys off one by one.

17
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:45,109
You got the, uh, huge force
that's moving, all armed.

18
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,115
- We did see shots fired.
- Affirmed.

19
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,345
- Roger that.
- Roger.

20
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,854
Take cover!

21
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:56,687
Look out for that bomb!

22
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,090
All right, let's go!
Move! Move!

23
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,405
Cover! Cover!
Cover! Cover! Cover!

24
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:15,562
12:00 o'clock!
Watch 'em!

25
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:16,833
Watch that left!

26
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,601
The roof!

27
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,443
Check the roof out!

28
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,249
Incoming!
Incoming left!

29
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,406
Incoming!

30
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,950
Got a bird!
A bird!

31
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,447
Take 'em out!
Take 'em out!

32
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,262
Hold them here.
I'll go for the package.

33
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,299
Remember, you still owe me ten Gs,
can't die yet.

34
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,767
- See you on the side.
- Men, RPG!

35
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,132
Move out!

36
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:49,706
We've got a man down!
Man down!

37
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,073
Wolfman.

38
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,404
Go! Go! Go!

39
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,072
Wolfman, you copy?

40
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,549
Copy!
Meet you on the south side!

41
00:04:33,573 --> 00:04:35,348
I'm on my way.

42
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,787
'Bout to have contact!

43
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,693
Somebody's
moving from the south. Over.

44
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,436
Motherfucker.

45
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,696
That's Commander Motherfucker to you.

46
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,500
Now, let's just find a way
I could let you two fools

47
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,472
walk out of here
for old times' sake.

48
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,202
What the fuck
are you doing here?

49
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,369
I'm working.
What the fuck are you doing here?

50
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,812
Saving the world, man?
When you gonna learn?

51
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,119
Go on, tactical genius.
See how this plays out.

52
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,621
Get out of here.
I got this.

53
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,520
Wha...
Yeah, go ahead.

54
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:16,126
Just... just run off, man.

55
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,557
Bye.

56
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:21,992
Oh, come on, man.

57
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,800
You're not still on that old shit,
are you?

58
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,132
I owe you one.

59
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,569
Man, you need to let shit go
and grow the fuck up.

60
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:29,872
I ain't got no time
for this shit.

61
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,341
Oh, you gonna make time today.

62
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,239
Just stop.

63
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,346
Yeah.
Extraction's ready.

64
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,641
Nah, just some checkers
showed up to a chess game.

65
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:38,805
It'll be..

66
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,046
Now, was that shit necessary?

67
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:26,624
Enjoy your evening.

68
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,798
He fuckin' played us.

69
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,322
Nearly seven months has passed
since the last sighting

70
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,483
of the infamous
self-made superhero

71
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,152
known as The Vigilante.

72
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,729
Made headlines last year

73
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:02,765
when he allegedly killed
a rising Armenian syndicate.

74
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,564
And with his disappearance,

75
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,400
the city's crime rates
have risen by 40%.

76
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:12,099
Michael Hanover's
web videos went viral

77
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,906
after being the only person to capture
The Vigilante in action.

78
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,982
The question is,
where is The Vigilante?

79
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:48,956

87
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:07,057
Handsome.

That'll make it fun.

89
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:14,295
I hear they call you
The Vigilante.

90
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:16,127
Is that correct?

91
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,863
Is that correct?

92
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,470

- Ah.

93
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:23,699
You can take pain.
I like that.

94
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:29,079
There's a very pissed off
Armenian boss who sent me.

95
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,138
You killed his baby brother.

96
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:48,299
And this is when he saw you,

97
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:51,561
Mike Hanover, the filmmaker.

98
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:00,073
And now he wants you
to suffer...

99
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:02,110
badly.

100
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,249
He will find Mike next.

101
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,442
You had no idea you were at war

102
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,611
with the Armenian mob, did you?

103
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:20,695
When was the last time
you were touched like this, <i>hmm'?</i>

104
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:22,856
Fuck you.

105
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,764
Wait.

106
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:04,925
Please!

107
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,468
Please, I told you.

108
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,908
I just party with Mike.
That's all.

109
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,808
I don't know where he goes.

110
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:18,040
I don't know what he does!

111
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,319
I'll tell you what he does,

112
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,119
this fucking joke.

113
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:32,593
He puts videos on the Internet
making this man to be a hero.

114
00:12:33,987 --> 00:12:36,991
That fucking psycho
that killed my baby brother.

115
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,678
But they said
The Vigilante's gone, right?

116
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:50,906
That he's dead!

117
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,176
That's not good enough.

118
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:57,082
You know, they sell T-shirts
with his face on 'em,

119
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,814
and I have to look
at that shit in the street.

120
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:04,694
- Ah!
- Mike Hanover.

121
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:07,687
Now, tell me where he is.

122
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:10,027
I don't know.
I don't know.

123
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,829
- I don't know. Please.
- Shh.

124
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,293
You look like shit.

125
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,870
Yeah, you do look like shit.

126
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,541
Come on, bitch.
That's right, bitch.

127
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,917
Motherfucker!
Die, motherfucker!

128
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,817
Fucker.

129
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,235
Fucker!

130
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,369
Die! Die!

131
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,569
Die already!

132
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,612
Fucking dick!
Die, mother...

133
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,721
Ew! Gross!
Gross, gross! Come on!

134
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,067
Shit, man!
I don't know where you been!

135
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,025
Just...

136
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:48,292
Oh, God.

137
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:56,233
That's me, Mike Hanover,
and I just killed a man

138
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,376
in a taco shop bathroom.

139
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:01,809
Hey, but he started it.

140
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,312
I been hiding near the border
looking for The Vigilante,

141
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,746
and hit men are on my ass.

142
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,817
Wait.
ls that how I really run?

143
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:11,751
Anyway, I had cars,
chicks, a badass crib,

144
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,324
and now I got this
piece-of-shit ice cream truck,

145
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,052
and we're on the run
from the Armenian mob.

146
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,892
It all started seven months ago
with a documentary I was making.

147
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,606
Okay, here's (he backstory,
so pay attention.

148
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,242
That's The Vigilante,
the big dude.

149
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,004
The big dude right there
mowing down bad guys and shit.

150
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:38,081
You met him as a Special Forces
in the prologue.

151
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,409
Not anymore.

152
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:42,519
Now he is running the streets
and taking out fuckin' drug dealers,

153
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:43,676
gangs, you name it.

154
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,584
He has a sidekick, too.

155
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,122
They call him The Kid.

156
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,022
Look, I got to tag along
and document some missions,

157
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:51,753
throw it up on the Web,

158
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,330
and that's what made this guy
Internet famous.

159
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,163
This last video
was at a heroin lab

160
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,269
where they were using
little kids as drug mules.

161
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,598
Can you believe that shit'?
It was fucked up.

162
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,503
So Vigilante was capping dudes
left and right.

163
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,171
Then he sent me and The Kid
to hang back

164
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:10,541
at his safe house
while he cleaned up the mess,

165
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,478
but this was
no ordinary safe house.

166
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,551
Oh, no, It had chicks,
titties, and it had Jade,

167
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,052
his numero uno lady.

168
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:20,555
She was like the Alfred
to his Batcave,

169
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,886
and they were this crazy,
badass couple.

170
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,292
She ran shit, but I should
have been watching out for Red.

171
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,692
That's right. This little hot chick
that worked for Jade.

172
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,998
I was blinded by that ass.

173
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,838
After that, we went back to
the heroin spot

174
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:35,497
to pick up The Vigilante,

175
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,902
but it was still crawling
with bad guys and shit,

176
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:40,908
and he was after these guys
something fierce.

177
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,173
The Armenian mob and him
had beef like a motherfucker,

178
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,409
and shit was about
to hit the fan.

179
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,492
Fuck.

180
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,559
Shit.

181
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,101
Don't move!

182
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,206
- Get your hands up!
- Don't fuckin' move!

183
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,898
Then it all made sense.

184
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,339
They wanted him there
to get his ass out in the open.

185
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,842
It was a setup.

186
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:17,880
No one's seen or heard
from The Vigilante since.

187
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,177
After all that that,
he was just gone, just like that.

188
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,550
When The Kid and I came back to find
the safe-house girls dead, we knew it.

189
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,951
We knew it was a setup.

190
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:30,117
Oh, shit, it's Jade right here.

191
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,193
This network secure?

192
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,365
Look, they might be able
to hack into my porn,

193
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,800
but other than that, we're good.

194
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:39,630
- Good.
- You feeling okay?

195
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:41,396
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

196
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,721
- I said I'm fine.
- You don't look so hot, all right?

197
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,800
I mean, you're still hot.
I'd bang the shit out of you...

198
00:17:46,966 --> 00:17:49,810
- Mike, shut up! Listen to me.
- Okay, what?

199
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:52,449
Intel over
the Mexican cartel feeds

200
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:55,051
have them holding an American captive
for the Armenian mob.

201
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,312
- Could be him.
- Shit!

202
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:59,888
Yeah.
No other reason why the Armenians

203
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,557
and Mexicans
could be working together.

204
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,061
The Kardashians could be
having a quinceañera.

205
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,395
I know a guy that can help.

206
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,965
- You know a guy?
- Yeah, I know a guy, all right?

207
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,398
Gay Barry.
He got me out of a few jams in L.A.

208
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,003
That's what he does.

209
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,504
You know, he's just one of those
connected dudes.

210
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:19,074
I didn't know if he was C.I.A.
or worked for the Apple Store,

211
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:20,505
but he just knows shit.

212
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:24,614
I guarantee he knows
some Call of Duty-type dudes.

213
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,908
I'll send someone over now.

214
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,642
- Who?
- Don't worry about it.

215
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,485
- The less you know, the better.
- Okay, as long as the dude is cool,

216
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,647
he'll be fine, all right?

217
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,415
Barry's a little weird.

218
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,150
- Weird?
- Eccentric.

219
00:18:59,205 --> 00:19:01,481
There's someone here for Barry!

220
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,851
Barry!

221
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:08,286
You interrupted my swim lesson.

222
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,787
This is Jake.
He's my swim coach.

223
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:16,162
Jake, go in the house.

224
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,122
Wipe that oil off
before you sit on the couch.

225
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,897
<i>Okay '</i>

226
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,669
Bro, you know why the fuck I'm here.
You gonna help me or not?

227
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,469
I would help you
if you'd learn some manners.

228
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,210
You can't just walk around
like you're Baby Blade

229
00:19:28,234 --> 00:19:29,434
and break into people's homes.

230
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,708
What's up with Generation Me?

231
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,248
None of you guys
give a shit about anything.

232
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,852
- You gonna help me or not?
- Okay, I'll help you.

233
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,080
But first, Marta,

234
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,849
get him
a sugar-free Red Bull.

235
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,653
Oh, my...
Really?

236
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,998
He's not here to fuck me.

237
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,693
Half of what you said
is not in my Rosetta Stone.

238
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:57,364
It's kind of...
It's almost like an arranged thing.

239
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,377
Let's just go in the house.
Marta!

240
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,014
I want my fucking burrito
after my meeting.

241
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,914
So, Vigilante, huh?

242
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,752
I like his work.

243
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,690
Actually, when Mike called me,
I got a boner for it.

244
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,695
Didn't say you'd be coming, though.

245
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,527
Yeah, Jade likes
lo keep us separate.

246
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:25,930
- Safer that way.
- Yeah, smart girl.

247
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,530
So, how did it work?

248
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,401
Were you in
the Big Brother program,

249
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,874
and Vigilante just walks in and says,
<i>"I'll</i> take the black one"?

250
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,708
- Fuck you.
- Touchy, are we?

251
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:39,077
- What is all this'!
- Every tactical op in the state...

252
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,151
F.B.I., C.I.A., A.T.F.,

253
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,508
some-even some chatter
from local terrorist cells, too.

254
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,645
I just monitor it,
look for patterns.

255
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,985
For what?

256
00:20:49,148 --> 00:20:51,992
Hey, just because I don't get up
at dawn anymore and do pushups

257
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:53,892
doesn't mean
I don't love my country.

258
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:57,000
- You ever heard of SEAL Team Six'?
- You were a SEAL?

259
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,658
Yeah, I was a SEAL.

260
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:01,668
"Don't ask, don't tell,"
it's fucking bullshit.

261
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:05,400
Besides, I'm still doing my part
to keep assholes like you safe.

262
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,009
Oh, here it is.

263
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,510
Okay, now the last thing
we got from Mike

264
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:13,844
has your boy right here
just south of the border in Mexico.

265
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,679
I know the perfect guys for this.

266
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,845
Ex-Blackwater studs,
bored and badass.

267
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:21,582
- They'll do this.
- How you know they'll do it'?

268
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,250
Trust me.
They'll do it.

269
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,986
- Marta!
- What?

270
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,462
- Get the car!
- Oh, no, no, no.

271
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:36,300
I can't get a divorce.
It's part of my cover.

- Hey, what's up?

279
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,496
Gay Barry!

280
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:12,870
- Wolfman.
- Gay Barry, man!

281
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,569
- What the fuck, man?
- We gotta talk.

282
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:18,738
I got us a gig.
It's big.

283
00:22:18,904 --> 00:22:20,975
Let's do this, man.
Let's talk.

284
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,416
It's huge, like 12 inches.

285
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:25,886
Come on, man.

286
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,365
Let's go talk, man.
You need to...

287
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:30,360
- You look good. You been training?
- Don't touch me, man.

288
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:32,723
- Mexico?
- Just the border.

289
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,421
- You have positive l.D.?
- Enough.

290
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,692
And you can trust the intel?

291
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,201
Who's paying?

292
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,201
Rich white kid from the B.H.

293
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,520
He's got the money, trust me.

294
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:45,767
He'll meet you guys in Tecate,
blitz extraction.

295
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:48,331
You'll be back in the U.S.
before you know it. It's all good.

296
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,345
- What's going on here?
- Time to go back to work.

297
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,878
Chillax, he's with me.
Gentlemen, meet Kid.

298
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,956
Is you going black now, Barry?

299
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,616
- Once you go black, man...
- Hey, fuck you, man.

300
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,625
Now, chill out,
little toy soldier.

301
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,695
A little badass, this one, huh?

302
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,423
This little badass

303
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:13,400
- is Vigilante's sidekick.
- Don't call me his fucking sidekick.

304
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,632
Look, Barry says you all
are who we need to get this done.

305
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,469
The Vigilante's being held
at the border

306
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,475
by the cartels,
and I need some more guns.

307
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,875
- Simple as that.
- What do you think, Geek?

308
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,380
If the intel's solid, I'm game.

309
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,915
I like paydays.-

310
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,644
It's true. Mexicans like paydays.

311
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:32,914
Oh, come on.
Mucho dinero, right'?

312
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,386
Oh, come on.
I'm just kidding.

313
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,787
So, what's up?
Can we do this or what?

314
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,160
There's only one thing
I like doing more than chicks.

315
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,491
It's making money.

316
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,544
Up!

317
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:32,376
Everyone!

318
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:58,565
What the fuck are you doing?

319
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:13,515
- What the fuck are you...
- Hey.

320
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,158
He was our brother.

321
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:18,488
You're ignoring your business,
my business.

322
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,994
You need to end this.

323
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,929
Just kill that motherfucker
and get it on with.

324
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:28,533
But we're not done yet.

325
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:32,107
I want the man who made
The Vigilante a hero.

326
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,266
You bring us down.

327
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,014
But I run this family.

328
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,883
Take the shot.

329
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,720
Two males.

330
00:26:24,883 --> 00:26:27,762
- Cannot confirm l.D.
- Green on both.

331
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,930
I-I have names,
contacts.

332
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,008
I can help you.

333
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:53,813
What the fuck?
He was still alive.

334
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:57,426
That's your fault.
You hesitated on your trigger pull.

335
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,522
We could have got names
out of him.

336
00:27:01,687 --> 00:27:04,497
He was the name.

337
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,539
What are you doing?
They're gonna be coming any minute.

338
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:18,648
- Ain't nobody coming in here.
- What are you talking about?

339
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,284
You were gonna pull on me there,
weren't you'?

340
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,716
I saw it in your eyes.

341
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:25,947
Yeah.

342
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:31,050
Your training's far from over, son.
Let's face it.

343
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,466
I'm fuckin' hungry.

344
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,625
Let's go get some breakfast.

345
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,237
If he's too good at what he does,

346
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,347
it can come back lo haunt you.

347
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,074
Man's gotta be careful nowadays.

348
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,748
If he's too good
at what he does,

349
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:01,255
it can come back lo haunt you.

350
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,829
Whole world's in an upheaval.

351
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,503
Sometimes when you're needed,

352
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:16,606
you gotta take care of business.

353
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:22,835
Your identity's gonna be erased
from all the databases,

354
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:24,742
foreign and domestic.

355
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,782
It'll be like you
were never even born,

356
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,942
like you never existed.

357
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:34,682
You understand your commitment?

358
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:40,259
And there is no discharge
from this service, son.

359
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:42,865
You're never gonna live
a normal life again.

360
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,960
You're a stone-cold killer...

361
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:49,971
plain and simple.

362
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:53,302
No family, no next of kin.

363
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,309
Ecerybody's gonna want you.

364
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:59,745
C.I.A., Rangers,

365
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,317
SEALS...

366
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,147
this ain't like that at all.

367
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,984
Those fellas
get to go home at night,

368
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,148
see their families,
kiss their wives,

369
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,124
and play with their kids,

370
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:14,230
build that little white fence
around the house,

371
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:17,731
and, you know, sing hallelujah.

372
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:22,233
Your country needs you,

373
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,635
plain and simple.

374
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:30,677
- You follow?
- I do.

375
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:34,443
All right.
Good luck.

376
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:51,596
Time to wake up, handsome.

377
00:29:54,426 --> 00:29:56,167
You'll like this.

378
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:16,885
That smells good.

379
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,722
What happened to you?

380
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:21,990
What happened to the tough guy

381
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:26,068
that's always in the news, hmm?

382
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:33,903
You are a fucking nobody.

383
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:37,070
You couldn't cut it with
the military or the feds.

384
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:41,646
Look who it is.

385
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,481
Can that piece of shit hear me?

386
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:46,918
Yes.

387
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:50,686
Hey, Mr. Vigilante,
or whatever the fuck your real name is.

388
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,593
You're a trophy now,

389
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,324
not a person.

390
00:30:57,489 --> 00:30:59,662
I want to know something.

391
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,761
Was it worth it?

392
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,999
No.

393
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:09,275
Except for that stupid look
on your brother's face

394
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,436
when I put a bullet in it.

395
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:18,778
Please send me videos.

396
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,185
Will do.

397
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:26,896
This is going to be fun.

398
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,432
I guess it's not your time.

399
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,133
Mmm.

400
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,652
That's how we say good-bye
in London.

401
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,730
Spread out! Find him!

402
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,494
I'll take the back!
Barry! Cover Geek!

403
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,223
Whew.

404
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,910
You got this.

405
00:34:03,842 --> 00:34:07,119
You motherfuckers!
This is Gucci!

406
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:26,708
Shit, you the motherfucker
we been looking for.

407
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:29,072
You still owe me ten Gs.
You remember that?

408
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:31,271
Now's not the time.

409
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:36,979
We have to go now.

410
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,597
- You good?
- All good.

411
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,841
I believe this is yours.

412
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,505
I thought it'd be bigger.

413
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:31,199
Yeah! Holy shit!
Aw, fuck!

414
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,036
Yes!

415
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:37,870
Shit, Jade, they fuckin' did it!
They got him!

416
00:35:38,036 --> 00:35:39,538
We got him!
He's okay!

417
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,149
- They did it!
- Copy that.

418
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,013
Man, you should...
It was insane!

419
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:45,211
You should have seen this shit,
the action.

420
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:47,220
There was RPGs
and there was land mines

421
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,723
and fuckin' night vision
and fuckin' machine...

422
00:35:53,018 --> 00:35:54,793
I even saw fuckin' kuh-tai-sin!

423
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:58,662
Kuh-to-sin!
It was fucking awesome!

424
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,236
- Mike, shut up.
- Oh, my God, wait! The Kid!

425
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,635
- The Kid was with them!
- I know. I know.

426
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:08,642
- Wait. What? You know?
- Of course. I've always known.

427
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,336
What did I say?

428
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:13,415
Safer to keep us separate.

429
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,212
Anyway, now that he's back,
it'll all be okay now.

430
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,410
Things will be different

431
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:21,250
and we can move... move on.

432
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:23,586
Jade! Jade!

433
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,819
The hell?

434
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:30,259
Holy shit. Red!

435
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:32,733
- Get out of the ice cream truck.
- I thought you were dead.

436
00:36:32,757 --> 00:36:35,431
Shut up. Now.

437
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,436
What are you doing?

438
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,938
- What are you doing?
- You really are an idiot.

439
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,375
Why would you go to the...

440
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,700
He's not gonna talk.

441
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:24,217
I have the package.

442
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:26,321
Enough with the military lingo.

443
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,651
I'm a civilian now.
I'm tired of hearing that shit.

444
00:37:28,813 --> 00:37:30,486
Now, you kidnapped
the rich kid, right?

445
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,457
Now don't say affirmative.
Say yes.

446
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:35,223
Yes.
I'm bringing him to you.

447
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,490
Nah, fuck, no.

448
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,574
Your boyfriend,
the dude that looks like Dracula,

449
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,067
he still wants revenge, right?

450
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:42,136
So bring the rich kid to him.
Let him have some fun.

451
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,600
The Vigilante's
still on the streets.

452
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:46,299
Good. That fucking gorilla
draws so much attention.

453
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:47,975
Let the cops and the feds
hunt his ass.

454
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,342
We can get to him.

455
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:51,503
No, no, no, no.
I have plans for him.

456
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:54,343
- Now, is that it?
- Yeah.

457
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:56,645
Enjoy your evening.

458
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:05,755
About that uranium...

459
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:08,591
I don't...
I don't know anything.

460
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,630
- I don't know.
- You heard him!

461
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,598
Where is it?

462
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,757
Tell him. Tell him!

463
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,476
You made a commitment.

464
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,711
I didn't beg you for that.

465
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:42,630
Calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

466
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,562
You should get that
looked at, you know.

467
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:47,066
Soon, yeah.

468
00:38:47,225 --> 00:38:48,795
What the fuck
happened over there?

469
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,748
- Nothing you need to know about.
- It's my life.

470
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,207
I'd like to know
what the fuck is going on.

471
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,711
Your life?

472
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,676
It's not your life anymore.

473
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,247
You gave that to me.

474
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:01,907
That belongs to me now.

475
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:04,383
You made a commitment.
I didn't beg you for that.

476
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:06,681
You don't remember, do you?

477
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:08,381
That was different.

478
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:09,923
It was for my country.

479
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:12,254
Now it's for the world.

480
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:14,488
All you gotta remember
is infiltrate,

481
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:17,326
pull the trigger,
and get the fuck out.

482
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,900
Outside of that,
there's nothing more to talk about.

483
00:39:20,058 --> 00:39:21,765
And if we've reached an impasse,

484
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,702
there's gonna be a conclusion
that you're not gonna like one bit.

485
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:27,774
I should've seen this coming.

486
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,276
I saw your psyche tests,
you know.

487
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:34,546
Propensity for rebellion
and challenge of authority

488
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:37,619
and, uh, borderline bipolar
and all that, you know.

489
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,056
Look, I don't need to hear
that fuckin' shit now. Come on.

490
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,421
It's been a short time, okay?
Get used to it.

491
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,957
You haven't been around that long.

492
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:47,062
I don't wanna, you know,
put down your worldview,

493
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,792
but, uh, it's never been
about, uh, good versus the bad.

494
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:54,095
It's about keeping
the powerful in power.

495
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:58,699
There's no out for you.
There's no out for me.

496
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,275
There's only the next mission.

497
00:40:46,911 --> 00:40:48,618
This is what you did
with that Arab cash.

498
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,624
We be diversifying, man.
I be flipping cars.

499
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,922
Tex be making tamales
and selling them.

500
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,998
And dude right here, man,
he opened up a gym.

501
00:40:57,155 --> 00:40:59,294
What's the name of your gym?
XPC? DFG?

502
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:01,334
- EPX.
- We got a problem.

503
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,031
I just got this.

504
00:41:06,698 --> 00:41:08,439
What the fuck?

505
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,976
How'd they get him?

506
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,413
Mike had to open up to communicate
with us about the feed.

507
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:14,610
They were watching.
They found him.

508
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,547
- Jesus.
- Who's they?

509
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:19,450
The entire Armenian mob.

510
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,112
They don't like me.

511
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:23,987
Nobody likes you.
Those dudes don't play.

512
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,721
Half of 'em ex-military.
Your boy's dead.

513
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,991
Wolfman, the fucking white guy,

514
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,157
The Armenians, all that shit,

515
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,133
ain't none
of our fuckin' business.

516
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:37,295
We did our job.

517
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:39,908
Here we are,

518
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,907
and there he is safe and sound.

519
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:44,012
Just show me the fuckin' money.

520
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,409
There is no money
if he fuckin' dies!

521
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:48,847
This fuckin' white guy
is the one who's paying.

522
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,317
I suggest you start planning
a rescue operation.

523
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:54,013
- From the Armenian mob?
- Yeah.

524
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,486
That's not a rescue.
That's war.

525
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,490
Look, I'll take a rain check

526
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,492
for saving your ass,

527
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:03,723
but this rich douche bag
who own daddy won't pay to save him...

528
00:42:04,922 --> 00:42:07,368
that ain't on us, man,
that's... that's your shit.

529
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,995
It is on me.
Just me.

530
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,604
I need wheels.

531
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,440
Got you.

532
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,777
Gear's in the back.

533
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:28,853
- You know where Mike Hanover is.
- Of course I know where he's at.

534
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:31,289
Planted a tracker on that dumb-ass
the day I met him.

535
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:34,396
The only person I trust is that
big motherfucker over there.

536
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,132
So, what's up?
We getting paid?

537
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:51,576
The dude still owe me ten Gs.

538
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,647
Nobody get paid around him.

539
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,993
What is that?
It's close.

540
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:11,099
There's his ass right there,
that black BMW.

541
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,327
All right, give him space.

542
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:34,746
- He's going in that garage.
- I got him.

543
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,211
Hang back.

544
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,379
What the fuck is this?

545
00:44:12,383 --> 00:44:14,192
It's a setup!
Go! Move!

546
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,532
Stop... stop moving.

547
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:07,472
You're dead.

548
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,339
I'll kill you.

549
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:02,622

00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,735
Whoa.

554
00:47:17,902 --> 00:47:19,677
Hello!

555
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,839
Someone wants to say hello.

556
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,576
Oh, Dad, come on!

557
00:47:23,741 --> 00:47:25,311
Can you two please stop?

558
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:27,183
Stop what?

559
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:29,325
Stop this?

560
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,481
Oh...

561
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:33,322
Look, tell your boss
I have what he wants.

562
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:34,929
Dad, look, don't pay.

563
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:38,590
You know how much I used to pay to get
tied up and get this kind of treatment?

564
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:41,930
Jesus fucking Christ.
Can you believe this kid?

565
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:45,267
No, no, no, listen.
Have you seen the ass on this one'?

566
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:46,931
Right?
She's hot, and she's Asian!

567
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:48,668
Michael, will you shut up?

568
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:50,608
Shut the fuck up!

569
00:47:50,768 --> 00:47:54,614
Look, tell that fuckin' Armenian I got
his money, and I'm sending it now.

570
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:57,446
This idiot's really your son?

571
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:00,589
Yes, that idiot
is really my son.

572
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,356
Raven...

573
00:48:12,123 --> 00:48:14,034
make our guest feel at home.

574
00:48:19,964 --> 00:48:23,878
So, anyway, r-really,
though, what's your name?

575
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:29,146
Listen, whatever my dad's paying you,
I'll pay you double.

576
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:32,810
Now all I... all I want to do
is just have a little fun here.

577
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:34,650
This is going to be fun.

578
00:48:34,812 --> 00:48:36,223
It will be fun.

579
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,552
Is that what you're saying?

580
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:39,490
- You're agreeing to my terms?
- Oh, yes.

581
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,130
Yeah, I have a camera we can use.
A little video?

582
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:45,893
What shall I do to you next,
you naughty boy?

583
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:49,128
- Sit on my face?
- Oh.

584
00:49:41,846 --> 00:49:43,553
We ain't gonna let you
go by yourself, man.

585
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:48,219
You're still easy to track.

586
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,856
This one's not gonna be pretty.

587
00:49:52,323 --> 00:49:55,133
It never is.

588
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,227
Hello, ladies.
Come on in.

589
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:27,096
Right in here.
See me later, okay?

590
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:28,931
Ugh.
Look at these idiots.

591
00:50:29,093 --> 00:50:31,004
Halloween's next month.
Come back then.

592
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:33,163
Hey!

593
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:26,217
- How we doing?
- Fine.

594
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:34,000
I'll be right back.

595
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:08,869
You like that, don't you,
you little shit?

596
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:11,870
All right!
Look, that's my boys coming, all right?

597
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:14,839
So why don't you just untie me
and just run?

598
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:16,444
But first, give me your email.

599
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,012
Hey!

600
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,568
You fucking idiot.

601
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:58,081
- Where are we going?
- To the sky, baby.

602
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:08,420
Hey, what you always
doing on the floor?

603
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:10,258
Fucking piece of shit got away.

604
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:12,025
Let's go get your boy.

605
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,226
I'll call for a pick up.

606
00:53:17,828 --> 00:53:20,069
- Just look, man.
- Shit.

607
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,539
All right, look, look, hold up!

608
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,413
- Why don't we ju...
- Give me that, you little shi...

609
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:28,508
Wait! Ohh!

610
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:30,618
Pull this out. Let me pull it out.

611
00:53:30,774 --> 00:53:34,017
I'm sorry. How is it?

612
00:53:34,178 --> 00:53:36,283
Is that better? Give...

613
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:40,224
Ah, shit!
Not again!

614
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:43,627
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What up, bro'?!

615
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:46,791
Wha...
This isn't what it looks like, bro.

616
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,757
It's not at all
what it looks like, all right?

617
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:50,465
Like, dude,
I knew you would come!

618
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:53,107
Dude, man, it is so good
to see you, bro.

619
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:55,503
- What the fuck's going on here, man?
- Another sidekick?

620
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:57,236
Dude, he's my sidekick.

621
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,472
- Fair enough. Hey!
- No, no. We good.

622
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,214
- We gotta go, man. We gotta go.
- Let's go.

623
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,479
That's awesome, dude.
You got a "V" on you!

624
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,382
Symbol and shit.
That's dope.

625
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,926
Give me the guns,
you freakin' lunatics!

626
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,621
You can't have these
in the streets!

627
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:23,036
- I'll get you next time.
- All right, man.

628
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:25,904
- Next time, right.
- Hey, dude. Get back, man.

629
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,673
Mike! Can you see me?

630
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:31,938
Yeah.

631
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,174
If it wasn't for that
goddamn documentary...

632
00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:37,285
Look, kid, just come home.

633
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:40,285
Home home?

634
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,481
You need anything?

635
00:54:45,082 --> 00:54:47,084
I think I'll be all right.

636
00:54:57,194 --> 00:54:59,538
- Yeah.
- Hot on patrol?

637
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:02,370
Every fuckin' day.
What do you want, Moreau?

638
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:05,343
Think of this
as a common courtesy call

639
00:55:05,502 --> 00:55:07,209
to a former protégé, that's all.

640
00:55:07,371 --> 00:55:08,873
I'm hanging up-

641
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:13,545
You know, I told you a long time ago,
it's not about right or wrong, okay?

642
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:17,021
L... I think, you know,
you decided somewhere along the way

643
00:55:17,181 --> 00:55:21,220
to use your infinite powers
to start a war, to go solo.

644
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:24,298
You wanted a war,
well, now you got one, don't you'?

645
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:28,302
But you went too far,
went too public,

646
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,405
went after the guys
who are paying the bills.

647
00:55:31,562 --> 00:55:33,803
What's gonna happen then?
They're gonna call me, right?

648
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:35,910
Good.
I'll be looking out for you.

649
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,977
Yeah, that's nice, but, uh,

650
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:40,213
you got a lot more to worry about
than that, you know,

651
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:42,740
- family and all.
- Family?

652
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:45,011
What the fuck are you talking about?

653
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:50,716
Oh, the infamous Vigilante
gone soft.

654
00:55:50,881 --> 00:55:53,157
Is that it?

655
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:22,289
You said you're comin' after me'!
Don't bother.

656
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:23,618
I'm on my way.

657
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,019
I'll be right here waiting.

658
00:56:37,461 --> 00:56:40,908
I think you still have
a soft spot for that maniac.

659
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,136
That's a very dangerous man,
and you just took his fuckin' wife.

660
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:46,440
No, we just took his fuckin' wife.

661
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:50,217
I'm gonna disappear
for a while, 'kay?

662
00:56:50,374 --> 00:56:51,478
And so should you.

663
00:56:51,642 --> 00:56:54,646
Man, I'm a businessman.
I got work to do.

664
00:56:54,811 --> 00:56:57,417
Besides, I'm not worried
about your boy right now.

665
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:00,960
I'll keep his attention
far away from me for a while,

666
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:03,064
send his ass to Armenia.

667
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:07,899
Let's remove Mr. Moreau
from my contact list.

668
00:57:08,058 --> 00:57:10,299
- Copy that.
- Make a left over here.

669
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,714
You know,
agents will flip-flop,

670
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:02,857
and ops will go sideways.

671
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:06,392
Best laid plans can turn into
a gigantic clusterfuck.

672
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,157
It happens.

673
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,358
So I had to improvise

674
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:16,800
and, um, rein things in...

675
00:58:18,528 --> 00:58:22,203
without declaring
our asset a total loss.

676
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,404
I tried everything
I could think of to...

677
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:29,573
get him on a leash and...

678
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:33,517
But he's feral, Christ.

679
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:36,089
That's another word
for a stray animal.

680
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:41,025
Or a rogue or a ronin or...

681
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:44,222
Whatever the fuck you wanna call him,

682
00:58:44,388 --> 00:58:46,425
but, uh...

683
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:50,003
you know,
I trained him right, and, uh...

684
00:58:52,062 --> 00:58:54,372
once he's dead set...

685
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:58,907
there ain't no stopping him.

686
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,177
And that is a fuckin' fact.

687
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,279
I need information.

688
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,512
All right.

689
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,209
You're not gonna drink?

690
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,719
You gonna help me or not?

691
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,888
<i>Okay.</i>

692
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:03,129
Let's go.

693
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:13,411
Good.

694
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:16,678
I've been trying
to forget that shit.

695
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:35,324
You sent your dogs
all the way out here

696
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:39,558
to my home to fuck with me?

697
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:43,000
- When is this game over'!
- When I'm done playing.

698
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:45,765
I am done playing.

699
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:48,671
The chess pieces
don't get to decide

700
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:50,971
when the game is over,
now, do they? No.

701
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:52,477
Somebody has
to think it through,

702
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:55,014
be three moves ahead
before he moves one piece,

703
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:56,946
and you are
a very valuable piece,

704
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,643
like my bishop.

705
01:02:58,808 --> 01:03:00,253
I need you in the game.

706
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:02,356
What do you want?

707
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:05,686
I have what I want.
I'm trusting you with it.

708
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:07,522
What is this?

709
01:03:07,684 --> 01:03:09,459
That's my pawn.

710
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,030
She'll bring him right to you.

711
01:03:12,422 --> 01:03:16,199
- The American?
- Yep, your enemy.

712
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:18,703
The man who killed
your brothers.

713
01:03:18,862 --> 01:03:21,206
I will find him myself.

714
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:23,935
I don't need to
kidnap babies to do it.

715
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,546
Why are you keeping me here?

716
01:03:26,703 --> 01:03:29,274
Because I need you there,
that's why.

717
01:03:29,439 --> 01:03:31,043
And I need him there, too,

718
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:33,153
alive and drawing fire
in his direction.

719
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:36,655
See, the you-versus-him thing,
that's just a diversion.

720
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,054
The real battle's bigger
than both of you,

721
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:42,389
and you're just a soldier,
so take your fuckin' orders.

722
01:03:43,687 --> 01:03:46,167
Fuckin' Count Chocula-looking
motherfucker.

723
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:49,328
- Sir.
- Just keep it going.

724
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:58,001
Welcome to Westminster Station.

725
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,239
If you are riding
the Piccadilly Line,

726
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:02,383
mind the gap.

727
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:05,042
Next stop, Piccadilly Circus.

728
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:33,737
Well, there she is.

729
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:38,280
Give me a kiss.

730
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:41,115
Come on, that's what you do.
We're in Europe.

731
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:42,950
What do you got for me?

732
01:04:43,113 --> 01:04:45,354
I have information.

733
01:04:45,515 --> 01:04:47,756
Come on.
Let's go for a walk.

734
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:55,598
I just-Since getting here,
I feel like shit.

735
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:57,636
It's always dark.
It always rains.

736
01:04:57,794 --> 01:05:01,537
And I know it sounds crazy,
I kind of miss my wife.

737
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:04,110
What do you got for me?

738
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,304
Here. Come over here.

739
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:10,713
So, I've got good news,

740
01:05:10,874 --> 01:05:12,410
and I've got bad news.

741
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,885
The good news is I found Jade.

742
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:18,821
The bad news is
she's in Yerevan, Armenia.

743
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:20,484
Fuck!
Again with the Armenians?

744
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:23,563
That Andreas has
a real hard-on for you.

745
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:26,400
You told me they were both dead,
they died when the chopper blew up.

746
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:28,799
It was bad intel.
I know.

747
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,918
You're gonna run into Red
while you're there, too.

748
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,405
She's kind of runnin'
the show down there.

749
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:33,772
She's a real bitch.

750
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,843
They sold my family
to the Armenians.

751
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,446
You know it's a trap, right?

752
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,013
They're gonna fucking kill you.

753
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:43,845
I don't even know
why you're going.

754
01:05:44,007 --> 01:05:46,920
- Thanks for this.
- No problem, man.

755
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:48,987
All right, good luck.

756
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:51,182
I hope you don't die.

757
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:19,549
So you are his girl, huh?

758
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:24,182
You know he killed
my cousins, too?

759
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,897
If I find out
you were involved in it,

760
01:06:33,056 --> 01:06:36,902
I will come back and smash
your neck just like this.

761
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:43,040
But, you know,

762
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:44,735
I'm a good babysitter as well.

763
01:07:19,102 --> 01:07:22,879
- Can I help you?
- I can't babysit this thing forever.

764
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:27,452
Is that what you
came in here to say?

765
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,122
This is fucking bullshit.

766
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:37,392
Welcome to Yerevan.
It's nice, huh?

767
01:07:37,554 --> 01:07:39,363
Okay, look right there.
See the big guy'?

768
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:42,128
That's The Lion.
That's Andreas' bodyguard.

769
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:44,294
Follow him,
and you'll find Andreas.

770
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:46,440
Find Andreas,
and you'll find your family.

771
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:48,596
A kid will approach you tonight
at the opera house.

772
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:50,110
Okay, ciao.

773
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:20,665
- How the fuck do you shut this up?
- Give her to me.

774
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:24,635
- I can't.
- Give her to me. She's hungry.

775
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:28,900
I said no.

776
01:09:29,065 --> 01:09:32,410
Red, give me the baby.

777
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:34,639
You work for me.

778
01:09:34,804 --> 01:09:36,477
Not anymore.

779
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,744
Fuck!

780
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:13,944
Amen.

781
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:33,865
<i>My soul.</i>

782
01:10:35,298 --> 01:10:37,539
I sold my soul.

783
01:11:58,781 --> 01:12:00,658
Andreas.

784
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:04,122
They're ready for you.

785
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,161
They need you.

786
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,360
Go without me.

787
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:14,302

Holy shit, bro.

804
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:17,079
It was a boring conversation,
anyway.

805
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:50,422
This is fucking ridiculous.

806
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:55,889
I agree.
This is fucking ridiculous.

807
01:15:56,052 --> 01:15:57,759
Don't make a scene.

808
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,526

this isn't gonna be like last time.

809

Now move.

812
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:14,205
Move!

813
01:16:17,473 --> 01:16:20,079
Somebody help me!

814
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:22,415
Please! I feel sick!

815
01:16:27,483 --> 01:16:29,895
I feel sick.

816
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:31,692
I don't feel good.

817
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:48,107
Mommy's here.

818
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,307
Shh.

819
01:17:04,854 --> 01:17:07,698
- You are fucking dead.
- I heard that before.

820
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:09,377
- You will never...
- Shut the fuck up.

821
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,028
You don't get to talk.

822
01:17:19,201 --> 01:17:22,341
- Don't even think about it.
- We've been here before.

823
01:17:23,706 --> 01:17:25,879
Andreas?

824
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:27,543
Just tell me where she is.

825
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:29,712
I don't think so.

826
01:17:29,879 --> 01:17:32,985
- You think I'm playing?
- No, I don't.

827
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:35,720
A-Andreas,
don't... don't do this!

828
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:41,226
Get down! Get down!

829
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:35,246
Just fucking great!

830
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:08,587
What?

831
01:19:21,824 --> 01:19:23,895
Go right! Go right!

832
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:49,687
Shit.

833
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:06,437
What the fuck?

834
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:14,710
I got this motherfucker!

835
01:21:42,531 --> 01:21:43,942
Where is she?

836
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:47,705
Where's my family?

837
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:59,208
You know it's not over.

838
01:22:59,374 --> 01:23:02,014
I know.

839
01:23:14,623 --> 01:23:16,227
- You just land'!
- Yeah.

840
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:18,029
- Where are they?
- Safe.

841
01:23:18,193 --> 01:23:20,571
What the fuck is going on?

842
01:23:20,729 --> 01:23:22,800
Desmond Barrington
is what the fuck's going on.

843
01:23:22,965 --> 01:23:24,239
Barrington's behind this shit?

844
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:27,039
Desmond Barrington
was behind the whole thing.

845
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:29,648
He played you.
He played the Armenians.

846
01:23:29,805 --> 01:23:32,411
He's been behind it
the whole fucking time, man.

847
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:35,077
And now, he's getting paid
to tip the global scales.

848
01:23:35,244 --> 01:23:37,690
- Where's Barrington now'?
- He's here in Los Angeles.

849
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:40,019
Look, you're gonna
see him tonight

850
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,752
at a high rollers game, okay?

851
01:23:41,917 --> 01:23:43,260
You're gonna have to look slick,

852
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:45,830
none of that Call of Duty armor
bullshit, okay?

853
01:23:45,988 --> 01:23:48,161
- You got a tux?
- Tux? Why?

854
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:51,600
- New Kid will fill you in.
- Wait. The New Kid?

855
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,671
Yeah.
You can thank me later.

856
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:06,043
Barry vouched for you?

857
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,779
No. Barry vouched for you.

858
01:24:08,944 --> 01:24:10,116
I'm The New Kid.

859
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:12,350
All right.

860
01:24:13,782 --> 01:24:15,090
Run it by me again.

861
01:24:15,250 --> 01:24:16,957
Members only.
No guns.

862
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:18,962
Metal detectors and pat-downs.

863
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:20,721
Barrington's in there tonight
celebrating

864
01:24:20,856 --> 01:24:22,056
some deal he's about to close.

865
01:24:22,124 --> 01:24:25,196
I get us in,
we find him, isolate him,

866
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:28,136
squeeze him for intel,
then we pop him.

867
01:24:28,297 --> 01:24:30,641
No, we don't pop a guy

01:27:50,432 --> 01:27:52,241
Who might your buddy be?

913
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,674
Oh, let me guess.

he's a hero, huh?

01:28:00,509 --> 01:28:02,113
Fuck it.
Go ahead, right?

916
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,450
I deserve it.

917
01:28:04,613 --> 01:28:06,490
I did just get paid
a billion dollars

918
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:09,356
to set off nuclear IEDs
all over the city.

919
01:28:09,518 --> 01:28:13,193
Why don't you call that off
before I shoot you in the head?

920
01:28:13,355 --> 01:28:15,426
Better me than my friend.

921
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:18,196
Nah, 'cause now it's time

922
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:20,806
for my friend to come
and ruin everything.

923
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,802
You chose
the wrong trick, bitch.

924
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,879
As much as I'm into
the girl-on-girl action,

925
01:28:29,037 --> 01:28:32,985
I'd like to stay here and watch,
but you're dead already.

926
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,178
Everyone in here is.

927
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:39,290
Enjoy your evening.

928
01:28:39,447 --> 01:28:40,892
Where are you going?

929
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:04,317
Come and get it.

930
01:29:04,472 --> 01:29:06,975
Oh, I plan on it, bitch.

931
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:16,896
On!

932
01:29:17,052 --> 01:29:19,163
Security,
guy at the bar, take him out now!

933
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:21,258
No guns! Tasers only!

934
01:29:38,273 --> 01:29:40,617
See, bitch?
I do my fucking job!

935
01:29:49,117 --> 01:29:51,461
You...

936
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:15,453
Comm check. Get outside.

937
01:30:15,477 --> 01:30:17,548
The Kid has Barrington's driver.

938
01:30:20,982 --> 01:30:22,825
I'm just driving!
I don't know anything!

939
01:30:22,984 --> 01:30:26,261
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

940
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:29,493
Okay, okay!

941
01:30:29,658 --> 01:30:32,662
- One more time, motherfucker!
- L.A. Live, P5.

942
01:30:32,827 --> 01:30:35,171
There's a bomb
in Bentley, old-school.

943
01:30:35,330 --> 01:30:37,901
You have to defuse by hand.

944
01:30:45,073 --> 01:30:46,746
Fuck, you okay?

945
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:50,583
Barrington's on foot.
He's got IEDs set all over the city.

946
01:30:50,745 --> 01:30:52,691
He's got the abort codes
on his phone.

947
01:30:52,847 --> 01:30:55,293
Make the call.
You take care of that.

948
01:30:59,154 --> 01:31:00,665
Okay, it's game time, guys.

949
01:31:00,689 --> 01:31:02,166
All right, we can't let Barrington
get away.

950
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:03,401
World, like,
literally depends on it.

951
01:31:03,425 --> 01:31:05,505
- Kid, where are we at?
- This is the parking garage.

952
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:07,334
Find the Bentley, P5.

953
01:31:07,495 --> 01:31:09,031
The L.A. bomb's
just a diversion, guys.

954
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:10,938
He's taking out cities
all over the world.

955
01:31:11,099 --> 01:31:13,110
Yeah, well, even his diversion's
gonna level downtown.

956
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:14,772
We've got no time.
This comes first.

957
01:31:14,936 --> 01:31:16,609
Oh, relax.
I got a guy on it.

958
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:20,110
Aw, hell, nah.

959
01:31:21,676 --> 01:31:23,986
Hey, man, you got me
out here all dressed up.

960
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:26,216
Man, I'm lookin' fly
as hell tonight, man.

961
01:31:26,381 --> 01:31:27,541
I was supposed to be the bomb.

962
01:31:27,615 --> 01:31:29,617
You didn't tell me that
there was a real bomb!

963
01:31:29,784 --> 01:31:32,663
What am I supposed to do
with this shit, man?

964
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:34,858
I ain't messing my uncle's tux.

965
01:31:41,062 --> 01:31:43,736
Click, click, motherfucker.

966
01:31:43,898 --> 01:31:45,900
Now toss your shit.

967
01:32:03,852 --> 01:32:06,924
- What you go! going on here'!
- Mall cop, get the fuck out of here.

968
01:32:07,088 --> 01:32:10,160
- This is a dirty bomb.
- Still can't park here.

969
01:32:10,325 --> 01:32:13,602
I ain't playing with you.
This shit can fuck up the whole city.

970
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:18,234
So, that's an actual bomb?

971
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,243
Damn right.

972
01:32:20,402 --> 01:32:22,575
<i>Okay '</i>

973
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,185
Yo, what's up, man?
How this gonna go down'?

974
01:32:26,341 --> 01:32:28,685
- Walk me through this shit.
- Walk you through it?

975
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:30,015
I thought you were demo!

976
01:32:30,178 --> 01:32:31,756
Look, I'm too busy
to help you out, all right?

977
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:33,357
I'm getting pings
from all over the world...

978
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:36,794
New York, Sydney,
Hong Kong, Mumbai.

979
01:32:36,951 --> 01:32:39,295
If Vigilante doesn't get Barrington,
we are fucked!

980
01:32:39,454 --> 01:32:40,455
We're so fucked!

981
01:32:40,622 --> 01:32:42,262
Vigilante has to get to
Barrington's cell.

982
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:44,702
That's where the codes are at.
It's inside his jacket pocket.

983
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:53,144
Still don't understand
how things work, do you?

984
01:32:53,301 --> 01:32:54,803
I guess I don't work that way.

985
01:32:54,969 --> 01:32:57,813
Clearly.
That's why your gun's over there.

986
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:03,279
What?

987
01:33:07,816 --> 01:33:09,557
Ah, fuck.

988
01:33:27,669 --> 01:33:30,172
You think I'm a bad guy.

989
01:33:30,338 --> 01:33:31,783
Whatever.

990
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:35,080
You ever heard
of the trolley problem?

991
01:33:35,243 --> 01:33:37,189
Fuckin' trolley?

992
01:33:37,345 --> 01:33:39,291
It's 2016, man,
there's fucking Uber.

993
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:42,587
No, the trolley problem.
It's a dilemma.

994
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:46,459
Okay, there's a runaway trolley
on a track.

995
01:33:46,621 --> 01:33:49,465
There's five people
tied to that track.

996
01:33:49,624 --> 01:33:52,969
Now, there's one person
tied to another track,

997
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:56,769
and there's a switch that
diverts the trolley, okay?

998
01:33:56,931 --> 01:33:58,933
Now, do you let nature
take its course

999
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:01,706
and let those five people
get killed by that trolley,

1000
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:03,713
or do you flip the switch?

1001
01:34:03,872 --> 01:34:07,684
See, me...
I flip the switch every time,

1002
01:34:07,842 --> 01:34:12,484
whether it's 500,000 people
saving 500 million.

1003
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:14,786
You get it?

1004
01:34:14,949 --> 01:34:17,225
That makes you feel good?

1005
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:19,456
Yeah.

1006
01:34:21,556 --> 01:34:23,627
Yeah.

1007
01:34:26,995 --> 01:34:29,236
That bomb downtown...

1008
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:32,401
I got a "Hurt Locker" genius
working on it right now.

1009
01:34:32,567 --> 01:34:34,740
There's no bomb he can't defuse.

1010
01:34:34,903 --> 01:34:36,143
Oh, baby Jesus, please help me.

1011
01:34:36,237 --> 01:34:38,342
Why do these wires
gotta be so small?

1012
01:34:38,506 --> 01:34:41,077
- Such thick fingers.
- Man, shut up!

1013
01:34:41,242 --> 01:34:43,387
I don't think you're supposed
to sweat on those like that.

1014
01:34:43,411 --> 01:34:45,851
You gonna do the red wire?
It's always the red wire in movies.

1015
01:34:45,914 --> 01:34:49,020
- Are you a bomb specialist?
- No, but 17...

1016
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:50,424
- No, no, don't do that.
- 15...

1017
01:34:50,585 --> 01:34:52,064
- Shut up! Don't do that!
- 13...

1018
01:34:52,220 --> 01:34:53,900
- Shut up! Shut up.
- Stay calm, stay calm.

1019
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:57,094
- 15 seconds! Stay calm!
- Shut up!

1020
01:34:59,260 --> 01:35:00,705
Fuck it.

1021
01:35:00,862 --> 01:35:04,241
- Ha ha! Booyah!
- That worked'?!

1022
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:06,343
- What's my name?! What's my name?!
- I don't know!

1023
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:08,870
Oh, my God.
We saved the city!

1024
01:35:09,037 --> 01:35:11,608
- I-I saved the city.
- You saved the city!

1025
01:35:13,107 --> 01:35:15,280
- I saved the city, man.
- You fuckin' saved the city!

1026
01:35:15,443 --> 01:35:18,287
- I did it! I did it!
- My black person.

1027
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:21,052
Watch your mouth.

1028
01:35:22,450 --> 01:35:24,896
L.A.'s good.
Barry, where we at?

1029
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:27,863
Hey, good job, Wolfie, but let's
not jerk each other off just yet,

1030
01:35:28,022 --> 01:35:30,866
'cause the main event's
about to go live worldwide.

1031
01:35:31,025 --> 01:35:32,732
Shit!
Am I seeing this right'?

1032
01:35:32,894 --> 01:35:34,703
There's surges all over.

1033
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,312
That Pakistani guy
you chopped up...

1034
01:35:45,473 --> 01:35:46,884
I don't know.

1035
01:35:46,908 --> 01:35:48,251
I don't know.

1036
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:51,049
These guys
ain't too happy about it.

1037
01:35:51,212 --> 01:35:53,317
Get in the car!

1038
01:35:55,116 --> 01:35:57,255
Get in the fucking car!

1039
01:36:15,737 --> 01:36:18,081
Tell me you've got that phone!

1040
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:20,084
He did and took an arm
for it, didn't you? Ouch.

1041
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:21,519
Here's (he abort hack.
Go.

1042
01:36:21,676 --> 01:36:24,953
We've got Barrington. He's safe.

1043
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:28,856
- Where to now, boss?
- We head outside the blast radius

1044
01:36:29,017 --> 01:36:30,963
and get ready for detonation.

1045
01:36:37,091 --> 01:36:38,866
<i>That motherfucker.</i>

1046
01:36:39,027 --> 01:36:40,971
These are ready
to launch, man, right now!

1047
01:36:40,995 --> 01:36:42,838
1-1 -3-8. Type it in.

1048
01:36:42,997 --> 01:36:45,944
- Okay, I got it.
- 1-1... What's your deal?

1049
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:47,545
I got it.

1050
01:36:47,702 --> 01:36:49,204
Oh, shit!

1051
01:36:49,370 --> 01:36:51,015
- Fuck, I had it upside down.
- Are you serious?!

1052
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:54,213
- Oh, my God! Come on!
- We're responsible for the apocalypse!

1053
01:36:54,375 --> 01:36:57,379
Bye-bye, London.
Tokyo, you're gone.

1054
01:36:57,545 --> 01:36:58,789
I don't even want to watch.
I don't even want lo watch.

1055
01:36:58,813 --> 01:36:59,893
I don't even want to watch.

1056
01:37:06,788 --> 01:37:08,790
Ho... holy shit, we did it!

1057
01:37:08,956 --> 01:37:10,993
Ha! We did it!

1058
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:13,639
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

1059
01:37:13,795 --> 01:37:16,241
Hey, guys,
I'm gonna give you all BJs!

1060
01:37:16,397 --> 01:37:20,038
- We saved the fuckin' world, man.
- I'm coming to get you, V.

1061
01:37:26,908 --> 01:37:28,910
The Vigilante is definitely back.

1062
01:37:29,077 --> 01:37:33,025
A bloodbath tonight at a downtown
Los Angeles nightspot.

1063
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:34,781
Over here outside
a downtown nightclub...

1064
01:37:34,916 --> 01:37:36,759
- The Vigilante...
- El Vigilante...

1065
01:37:36,918 --> 01:37:38,420
- Vigilante!
- Vigilante!

1066
01:37:38,586 --> 01:37:39,860
Continuing coverage tonight.

1067
01:37:40,021 --> 01:37:42,592
I'm joined by Mike Hanover,
web filmmaker,

1068
01:37:42,757 --> 01:37:46,261
famous for his viral hit,
"The Vigilante Diaries,"

1069
01:37:46,427 --> 01:37:49,408
and it appears that
The Vigilante is back.

1070
01:37:49,564 --> 01:37:52,067
That's right. He's back.
I'm back. We're back, man.

1071
01:37:52,233 --> 01:37:53,610
I'm the guy behind the guy.

1072
01:37:53,768 --> 01:37:55,179
That was me.
I put him on the Web.

1073
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:57,577
I made his **** famous.
That's right.

1074
01:37:57,739 --> 01:38:00,777
So what about the reports we're hearing
that The Vigilante saved the city?

1075
01:38:00,942 --> 01:38:03,354
Uh, he saved the city.
I saved the city.

1076
01:38:03,511 --> 01:38:06,458
- That's what we do, all right?
- We save ****.

1077
01:38:06,614 --> 01:38:09,117
Last month, we saved the city
from a mob, a big mob.

1078
01:38:09,283 --> 01:38:11,095
And you know what,
he went overseas without me,

1079
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:12,763
and I'm not gonna
hold that against you, Vigi,

1080
01:38:12,787 --> 01:38:14,331
but, you know what,
I like fish and chips

1081
01:38:14,355 --> 01:38:15,857
and pints and all that
good stuff.

1082
01:38:16,023 --> 01:38:17,434
But I'm here
holding down the fort.

1083
01:38:17,592 --> 01:38:18,969
I'm here in The City of Angels.

1084
01:38:19,127 --> 01:38:21,073
You know Bond's guy,
the intel guy?

1085
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:23,971
I'm that guy, but I'm better.
That's right. Umph!

1086
01:38:24,132 --> 01:38:25,634
Okay, we'll keep this on topic.

1087
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,545
So, does that mean that you're still
involved in The Vigilante's affairs?

1088
01:38:28,569 --> 01:38:29,729
That's what I've been saying.

1089
01:38:29,804 --> 01:38:33,149
I'm always involved, involved some way,
one way or another, right?

1090
01:38:33,307 --> 01:38:35,810
So, Vigi, hit me up, man.
I'm ready for that next mission.

1091
01:38:35,977 --> 01:38:38,617
- I got a new camera.
- I can document the **** out of it!

1092
01:38:38,780 --> 01:38:41,158
And you can come, too,
if you want, girl.

1093
01:38:41,315 --> 01:38:43,454
Uh, okay.
Uh, thanks.

1094
01:38:43,618 --> 01:38:45,495
Uh, we're gonna toss it
back to the studio.

1095
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:47,428
Tossing... salad.

1096
01:38:51,726 --> 01:38:55,674
- That's one hell of a story.
- Yeah, it's damn good, isn't it'?

1097
01:38:55,830 --> 01:38:58,834
One more for my colleague
over here.

1098
01:39:00,735 --> 01:39:03,511
I gotta know...

1099
01:39:03,671 --> 01:39:06,413
100% that you're in.

1100
01:39:06,574 --> 01:39:09,748
You know you should have had me
in the loop from the start, right'?

1101
01:39:09,911 --> 01:39:11,982
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1102
01:39:12,146 --> 01:39:14,023
Could have saved you
a lot of time and money.

1103
01:39:14,182 --> 01:39:16,924
Lot of motherfuckers
would still be alive, too.

1104
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:21,660
Yeah, then there's that.

1105
01:39:21,823 --> 01:39:24,633
- But I wanted to do it my own way.
- Yeah.

1106
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:28,365
If you want to catch
Frankenstein's monster,

1107
01:39:28,529 --> 01:39:30,531
you don't use Count Chocula

1108
01:39:30,698 --> 01:39:33,542
or the Wolfman
or the "Mommy."

1109
01:39:35,203 --> 01:39:37,012
- "Mommy." Yeah, that's funny.
- Yeah.

1110
01:39:37,171 --> 01:39:38,548
You threw that in there.

1111
01:39:38,706 --> 01:39:40,982
You want to catch the monster,

1112
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:43,122
use the Invisible Man.

1113
01:39:45,379 --> 01:39:47,188
I'll bring him in.

1114
01:39:47,348 --> 01:39:50,124
Well, yeah,

1115
01:39:50,284 --> 01:39:52,389
but make sure he's still alive,

1116
01:39:52,553 --> 01:39:56,660
'cause he's very fuckin' expensive.

1117
01:39:56,824 --> 01:39:58,565
Don't make a mess.

1118
01:40:01,729 --> 01:40:03,902
They came in before you did.

1119
01:40:09,036 --> 01:40:11,380
So...

1120
01:40:11,539 --> 01:40:13,576
you want the guy playing
with his phone,

1121
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:15,721
or the clown with
the H.K. behind us

1122
01:40:15,877 --> 01:40:17,686
pretending like he's drunk?

1123
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:20,416
I think I'll take
the guy on the phone.

1124
01:40:29,423 --> 01:40:31,733
Ow!

1125
01:40:37,098 --> 01:40:39,374
Sorry about the mess.

1126
01:40:39,534 --> 01:40:41,912
I'll see you next time, bro.

1127
01:40:44,772 --> 01:40:47,116
I'm fucking hungry, man.

1128
01:40:47,275 --> 01:40:48,879
Let's go get something to eat.

1129
01:40:50,077 --> 01:40:51,454
