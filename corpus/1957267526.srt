00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:33,931
And, Angel and Papi...

181
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:38,836
He never thought that so close
to home, in our neighborhood,

182
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,905
in our community,

183
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,375
he would ever see
the kind of romance and love

184
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,411
that he saw in the movies.
(laughs)

185
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:48,246
Real, true love.

186
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,114
And in these darkest times,

187
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,584
your love gave him hope
for the future.

188
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,287
And to the Great Council...
(laughs)

189
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,458
Manhattan, Castle and Jack.

190
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,994
He said...

191
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,630
"Fellas, we held
our crazy world together,

192
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:09,100
"the tribal chiefs, the four
pillars of the ballroom.

193
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,703
"Whatever legacy I leave behind,
I owe it to your friendship

194
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,973
and your commitment
to the magic of the balls."

195
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,312
And, Ricky.

196
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,081
To you he wrote,

197
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:27,185
"I was never old.

198
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,853
"I was never sick with you.

199
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:32,623
"I didn't have to be an emcee
on a stage or a father.

200
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,793
"In the best moments we shared,
there was no performance.

201
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,328
I was just me."

202
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,635
(sniffles, exhales)

203
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,139
What did Pray say to you, Ma?

204
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,975
Nothing.

205
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:55,380
There was nothing ever
left unsaid between us.

206
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,721
(laughs)

207
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,525
There's one more thing
we got to do.

208
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,993
Something that Pray never asked,

209
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,463
but I know he would want.

210
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:15,733
I didn't use all those ashes up
in those lockets.

211
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:19,671
We gonna use the rest of them,
and put them somewhere special.

212
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,910
ALL (chanting):
ACT UP! Fight back! Fight AIDS!

213
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:29,981

220
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,213
(faster):
ACT UP! Fight back! Fight AIDS!

221
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:53,638

- ACT UP! Fight back! Fight AIDS!

222
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,841

223
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:59,577

00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,013
ACT UP! Fight back! Fight AIDS!

225

Candles are for birthday cakes.
Why you got to be so silly?

267
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:51,081
This is more important
than a birthday.

268
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:53,057
Because as of today,
my baby girl's

269
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,618
officially a nurse.

270
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,989
And on top of all of that,
it's our four-year anniversary.

271
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,992
Now, go on
and blow out that candle

272
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,661
before it drips
all over the place.

273
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,517
Go on, girl. You're so dramatic.

274
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,118
BLANCA: I got to make a wish.

275
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,730
So, it's carrot cake
and cream cheese?

276
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:13,804
Your favorite.

277
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,173
Thanks for understanding
about Saturday.

278
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,475
Of course. You got to do
what you got to do.

279
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:19,844
Do your thing.

280
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,424
We'll celebrate
our anniversary next weekend.

281
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,149
- Okay.
- But, in the meantime,

282
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,418
I'll just be thinking
of all the things you could do

283
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,887
- to make it up to me.
- You so nasty.

284
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:32,824
- You love it?
- I do.

285
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,625
(chuckles)

286
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:37,028
You been up there
to see Judy yet?

287
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,907
Is she still working
up on the fourth floor?

288
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,265
Same floor.

289
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,799
It's a different gig though.

290
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:44,413
You should go up there
and say hey.

291
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:46,404
Show your face. She misses you.

292
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,139
And you get to see what
they've done with the place.

293
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,387
Since, you know, you done
left us for Saint Vincent's.

294
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,411
(laughs)

295
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,022
- You're Saint Vincent's.
- (laughs)

296
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,647
Think you, think you fancy now.
(laughs softly)

297
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,193
- Okay, baby.
- All right.

298
00:16:58,217 --> 00:16:59,616
You have a good day at work.

299
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,063
And I'll see you later on
tonight?

300
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,231
Yes, you will. Yes, you will.

301
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:04,322
Come here.

302
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,437
(singsongy): Later, man.

303
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:10,461
Tasting like a cupcake.

304
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:12,174
I'm gonna be tasting
like that tonight.

305
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,197
Don't start nothin'.

306
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,501
- Thank you.
- Don't start nothin'.

307
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,069
Whew. Whew!

308
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,239
(babies crying)

309
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,392
<i>NURSE JUDY: Remember how I said</i>

310
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,516
I didn't become a nurse
to help people die?

311
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:33,751
Mm-hmm.

312
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,252
Well, look at me now.

313
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,032
I mean, it's so great
to come to work

314
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,256
knowing that life awaits me.

315
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,125
And the smell of babies?

316
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,427
- It's my new happy place.
- You know,

317
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,797
I don't even recognize
this place anymore.

318
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,532
They got all of this
brand-new equipment,

319
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,035
and they finally painted
these nasty-ass walls.

320
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:54,037
(scoffs) The hospital magically
came up with a budget

321
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,133
for all sorts of things
once AIDS patients

322
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,275
- didn't come in as often.
- Mm-hmm.

323
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:02,346
(sighs) God, those new drugs
are a fucking miracle.

324
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:04,248
I've never felt better.

325
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,383
I'm so proud that
you never gave up.

326
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:08,051
You're healthy.

327
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:09,387
You have a hot man.

328
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,855
- (laughs)
- A new job at Saint Vincent's.

329
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,424
Mm-hmm.

330
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,461
You're gonna live a very long
and happy life, Blanca.

331
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,664
You know, I didn't believe that
for the longest time, Judy.

332
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,133
But now,
I think you might be right.

333
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,335
That's why I volunteer.

334
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,605
I got to give back what was once
freely given to me.

335
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:33,477
I see Pray Tell looking
down at you, smiling.

336
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,646
Mm. I hear him all the time.

337
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,781
I do.

338
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:40,318
Sometimes he gives me advice.

339
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:44,021
And sometimes
he tells me a joke.

340
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,491
But most times
he gives me reassurance

341
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,895
that I'm taken care of and that
everything is gonna be okay.

342
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,329
Keep listening to him.

343
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,998
I do.

344
00:18:55,768 --> 00:18:59,003
(babies crying)

345
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,938
(quietly): Look at the babies.

346
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,775
- Aren't they sweet?
- They are beautiful.

347
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:18,022
Uh, patient 35117?

348
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,401
(phone ringing in distance)

349
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,576
(Blanca sighs)

350
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,747
Safaree,

351
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,384
you tested positive for HIV.

353
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,195
Um... here.

354
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,265
Is there anyone you can call?

355
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,166
Friends? Family?

356
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,237
I just moved here
six months ago.

357
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,172
My parents don't speak
to me no more.

358
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,475
I ain't got no one.

359
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,744
Have you been working the pier?

360
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,913
I know it well.

361
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,682
- You do?
- Yeah.

362
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,985
I used to work there myself
when I was your age.

363
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,986
Back then, there were six piers.

364
00:20:23,122 --> 00:20:25,056
And now there's only one.

365
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,825
Look.

366
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:30,861
When I found out
that I was HIV positive,

367
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:33,563
there weren't any
drugs that were available.

368
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,766
AIDS was a death sentence.

369
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,435
But now people are living
long and healthy lives,

370
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:40,348
as long as we keep
taking our meds

371
00:20:40,372 --> 00:20:42,540
and listening
to what the doctors say.

372
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:47,044
- You're HIV positive?
- I am.

373
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,047
And I'm proof
you are gonna be okay,

374
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,616
if you follow the protocols.

375
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,819
- I can't afford all that.
- Well, see,

376
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,521
that's why I'm here to help.

377
00:20:57,657 --> 00:21:00,223
I am gonna help you
get signed up

378
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,726
for the AIDS
Drug Assistance Program.

379
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,828
Depending on your income,

380
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:08,165
you might not even have to pay
a penny for your health care.

381
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:10,768
And let me tell you something.

382
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,538
You are gonna be okay.

383
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,344
How about this?

384
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,081
There is a function happening

385
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,082
on Saturday night.

386
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:29,787
Something I think
you might enjoy.

387
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,557
It's where I found my community.

388
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,261
And where I found my hope.

389
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,440
("Love Like This"
by Faith Evans playing)

390
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:55,779
♪ <i>I never knew there was a</i> ♪

391
00:21:55,914 --> 00:21:59,116

392
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:01,751
(Blanca and Angel vocalizing)

393
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:06,490
♪ <i>Never had someone</i>
<i>to show me a love</i> ♪

394
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:11,127
♪ <i>Love like this before...</i> ♪

395
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,308
Looks like we aren't
the only ones who had the idea

396
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,932
for a ladies' lunch.

397
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:18,302
Well, it is
the<i> Sex and the City</i> effect.

398
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,171
These ladies all came
into the city to have sex?

399
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:23,641
- (Lulu snorts)
- You ever seen<i> Sex and the City?</i>

400
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,086
BLANCA:
Yeah, girl.
You ain't got HBO?

401
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,487
LULU: Yeah, you loaded.

402
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,622
I figured
you would have splurged

403
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:28,757
on the premium movie package
by now.

404
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,514
- Right.
- Showtime, HBO, Cinemax.

405
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:31,760
- (laughter)
- BLANCA: Word.

406
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,083
Rich girl.

407
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,763
I don't have television
in my penthouse.

408
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,398
It rots your brain
and turns it to Cream of Wheat.

409
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:39,556
Okay, look. I have to be honest,
I tried watching that show.

410
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,970
And first of all, I ain't never
seen women talk about sex

411
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,060
as much as they do.

412
00:22:43,196 --> 00:22:44,740
And second of all,
they need to call it

413
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:45,924
<i>Being White and the City.</i>

414
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:47,709
'Cause ain't none of them girls
got a Black

415
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,210
- or Latina friend.
- ANGEL: Not one.

416
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,001
- Not even a sidekick.
- ELEKTRA: Mm.

417
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,137
Let me guess, Cosmopolitan?

418
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:54,850
Thank you. Yes, I am.

419
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,507
- (laughter)
- Bitch, a Cosmo is a drink

420
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,542
that the
<i>Sex and the City</i> ladies love.

421
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,378
I'll have a real drink.

422
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,624
Johnny Walker on the rocks.

423
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,548
Blue Label if you have it.

424
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:07,117
Bring four, actually.

425
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:10,520
I refuse to let
some TV show about white girls

426
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:13,791
define how we eat, drink
and gather as girlfriends.

427
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,358
We've always made our own rules,

428
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,893
and we ain't stopping now.

429
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,895
- I know that's right.
- Heard that.

430
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,430
Mm-hmm.

431
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,999
I told those mafia gentlemen,

432
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:23,767
I know men.

433
00:23:23,903 --> 00:23:25,569
I know what turns them on.

434
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:28,072
Yes, phone sex was lucrative,

435
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:29,818
but only because
there wasn't a better option.

436
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:31,708
Now there is.

437
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,610
Webcam interactions.

438
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,585
Remove the need
for the imagination

439
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:36,958
and you can charge
twice the price.

440
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,883
That alone pays for my condo
in Boca Raton.

441
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:41,919
Darlings, I was rich before,

442
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:44,721
but now if I drop a
thousand dollars on the street,

443
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:47,591
I don't even bother
wasting time to pick it up.

444
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,772
- ANGEL: Ooh...
- Well, you talking real tough,
Elektra.

445
00:23:49,796 --> 00:23:52,096
But I know you quietly
giving money to those hospitals

446
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:53,542
and those
drug-treatment facilities

447
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:55,177
- to help the girls.
- LULU: Mm-hmm.

448
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:58,601
And she's paying for hormones
and surgeries, too.

449
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,571
A regular transsexual
Robin Hood.

450
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:03,574
- (Lulu laughing)
- Shh! Don't be so loud, ladies.

451
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:06,976
I have a reputation as a cold,
hard bitch to uphold.

452
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,447
Okay, well, if you ever decide
you need a new accountant

453
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,427
to deal with the money
you actually declare

454
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,018
to the government, give me
a call, because First Manhattan

455
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:17,165
just moved me over to
their tax department.

456
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,834
- BLANCA: What?
- And I am helping people
with their taxes now.

457
00:24:19,858 --> 00:24:22,960
- What? Lulu, that is incredible.
- Congratulations.

458
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:25,929
- So bougie, in a good way.
- BLANCA: Right.

459
00:24:26,064 --> 00:24:28,799
Well, what about you, Angel?
What's your update?

460
00:24:28,934 --> 00:24:30,634
My baby started third grade.

461
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,614
-Okay. -Oh. -Mm-hmm.

462
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,105
You know,
being a full-time mother is...

463
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:37,674
It's just the most craziest,

464
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,521
most beautiful thing
in the world.

465
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:42,212
I make breakfast for him
every morning.

466
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,880
It's just cereal and milk,
but...

467
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:47,484
- Oh, girl.
- I put a napkin out
and everything. Okay?

468
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,419
- You wake up before noon?
- Every day.

469
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,055
- Okay.
- Except Sunday, that's Mommy's
morning to sleep in.

470
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:54,291
I heard that.

471
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,837
And Papi's getting me back
in the game, y'all.

472
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:57,773
They putting me on a bottle
of this new hairspray

473
00:24:57,797 --> 00:25:00,208
- that's for real thick,
curly hair, just like ours.
- Oh...

474
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,498
I'm-a get y'all bottles.

475
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:02,977
Oh, my God. I forgot
to tell y'all about Damon.

476
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,612
- He sent me a letter, y'all.
- LULU: Really?

477
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,736
Yes. Yeah, he's in Chicago,

478
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:09,372
living with some nice man
who's got three dance studios

479
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,074
that he teaches in.

480
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,210
And he wanted me
to send y'all all his love.

481
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,178
ALL: Oh...

482
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,292
Well, that's lovely.
He has a sugar daddy.

483
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:19,250
- Oh, my God.
- Mm-hmm.

484
00:25:19,385 --> 00:25:22,786
And we all know about you,
Mother Blanca.

485
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:25,188
A real, official nurse.

486
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,892
Educated, graduated
and certified by the state.

487
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,428
Who would have guessed
that you would have found a way

488
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:34,030
to monetize your annoyingly
endless kindness

489
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,200
for your fellow man.

490
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:39,469
I am so proud of you.

491
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,472
My heart. My Blanca.

492
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,108
(scoffs) Okay, stop.

493
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,945
Happy endings are for movies.

494
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,648
We done been through too much
pain to fool ourselves

495
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:52,716
into thinking that all the bad
is in the past,

496
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:56,987
but I do believe in...
happy moments.

497
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:00,623
Sometimes they last a minute,
sometimes a year.

498
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,159
But when they come... ooh,

499
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,729
you just got to recognize
and celebrate, so...

500
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,032
Here's to all of our
happy moments together.

501
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:15,104
Not only did we survive,
but we are thriving.

502
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,418
- Cheers.
- Amen. Clink, clink,
clink, clink, clink.

503
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,809
- Cheers, Mama.
- Yes.

504
00:26:19,945 --> 00:26:21,344
Mm.

505
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,313
Oh, shit. Look, I got to go.

506
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:25,227
I got to help these kids get
ready for the ball tonight.

507
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,251
Ay, Mother Blanca
and her children already?

508
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:30,287
Okay, listen. These kids
are trophy-winning machines.

509
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:35,492
Why do you insist on going back
to that sweaty, airless room?

510
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,371
Can't you see
we've all outgrown it?

511
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:40,063
Elektra, you know you can't
outgrow your family.

512
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,699
Besides, you got to remember
why the balls started

513
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,200
in the first place.

514
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:46,113
They were a place for all of us
to be all of them things

515
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,471
that we weren't
allowed to be out in the world.

516
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,408
All right, how many times
have we walked Businesswoman?

517
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:53,444
And now you a real one, Elektra.

518
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,479
Or Runway, Miss Angel.

519
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,451
And now you actually walk
the real runways.

520
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:02,719
We weren't pretending
when we walked those categories,

521
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,388
we were preparing.

522
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:06,022
Faking it until we made it.

523
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:07,557
And more than anything,

524
00:27:07,693 --> 00:27:09,960
we made a statement.

525
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:14,664
That we deserve to dream
and have our dreams fulfilled.

526
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,560
When we were walking
those balls,

527
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:18,480
we beared witness
to our possibilities.

528
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:20,615
And we say to each other,
"Yeah, girl, I see you.

529
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,239
I see who you are
and who you can be."

530
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:25,120
And then the outside world,
they tell us to hide.

531
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,110
But in the balls...

532
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,346
they tell us to strut.

533
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:33,350
We can never give up
on the balls.

534
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,687
LULU:
Blanca, that is so beautiful,

535
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,489
but I can't make it tonight,
girl.

536
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,135
But I promise
I'm-a come by soon.

537
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,759
It's tax season, girl.

538
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:43,927
You understand.

539
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:45,595
Okay. Angel?

540
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,331
- Hmm?
- Hmm.

541
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:49,546
Oh, no, my baby, uh,
he got the sniffles.

542
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,902
I got to go home
and take care of my child.

543
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,804
Sweaty, airless...

544
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,206
No.

545
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,061
Okay, look. I know y'all busy,

546
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,676
and y'all have your own lives,

547
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,545
but can we do this again soon?

548
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,024
- Yes, of course.
- Yes, of course.

549
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,181
- Of course, come on.
- Yes, of course.

550
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,061
I love each and every
last one of you.

551
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,285
Even you, Mother Elektra.

552
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,087
Especially me.

553
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:12,922

Hi, Mama. Oops, sorry.

572
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,936
Dionne, you're late.

573
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,911
Now, if you're
gonna be an Evangelista,

574
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:01,905
you got to follow my rules.

575
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,273
Early is on time.

576
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:04,975
And on time is late. I know.

577
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,110
I'm sorry, Father.

578
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:08,345
I don't need your words.
I want action.

579
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,814
If Father can leave rehearsal
with Destiny's Child early,

580
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,550
you have no excuses.

581
00:29:13,686 --> 00:29:15,526
But Grandma Blanca
was late, too.

582
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,787
Um, excuse me, Miss Thing.

583
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,001
I had all my finery intact
when I got into my cab ride.

584
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,090
Thank you very much.

585
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:22,292
And when was it okay

586
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,494
for y'all to call
y'all grandmother out?

587
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,710
You know what they say.

588
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,075
(singsongy):
Snitches get stitches!

589
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,000
Okay. You need to talk
to these children.

590
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,468
Look at this. Look.

591
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,571
You all are Evangelistas.

592
00:29:35,707 --> 00:29:37,173
Now, this house is known

593
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,509
for more than just
slaying a category.

594
00:29:39,645 --> 00:29:42,679
We... all of us... are a family.

595
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,681
Now, what's my number-one rule?

596
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,450
Evangelistas always show up.

597
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,286
OTHERS: For each other.

598
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:51,365
- No questions asked.
- RICKY: That's right.

599
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:52,956
Rule number two...

600
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,793
Show up for yourself.

601
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:58,688
BLANCA:
All right, y'all. Come here.

602
00:29:58,764 --> 00:29:59,997
I got something to say.

603
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,438
Each of you came into
the city to find yourselves,

604
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:11,841
and look at you,
you found each other.

605
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,478
You're part of a legacy.

606
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:19,382
A chosen family rooted in love,
loyalty and support.

607
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:21,617
- That's right.
- Right?

608
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:24,988
Don't ever forget,
if you get lost,

609
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:28,158
love will lead you back
to your house.

610
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:30,905
Now get out there
and show ballroom

611
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,462

612
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:34,797
ALL: Evangelista!

613
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,577
- All right.
- RICKY: And please...

614
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,202
let my future man
be out there watching.

615
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,482
- (laughs)
- In Jesus' name. Amen!

616
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,384

We have a very special guest

the one, the only...

675
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:01,044

who makes Diana Ross

Thank you
for that very warm greeting.

682
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:28,137
(cheering continues)

683
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,939
Ballroom is home.

684
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:31,908
Ballroom is family.

685
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,810
Ballroom is love.

686
00:33:33,946 --> 00:33:35,489
And if it weren't
for this community,

687
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,380
I wouldn't be where I am today.

688
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:40,250
- (scattered cheering)
- I wouldn't be who I am,

689
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:42,786
if it weren't for
the many women, my sisters,

690
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,988
who lifted me up
when I couldn't do it myself.

691
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,892
As Tyrone observed, correctly,

692
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,662
yes, I am an icon.

693
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:55,164
But that didn't happen
overnight.

694
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,168
I worked hard to leave
an indelible statement.

695
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:02,439
I know the work and sacrifice
it takes to become a legend.

696
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:04,807
To be a legend isn't simply

697
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:07,777
about competing
and collecting trophies.

698
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:11,848
It's about how you
