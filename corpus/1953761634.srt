1
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,731
Brother.

2
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:44,436
My Lord Beothric.

3
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,107
He is mortally wounded.

4
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,276
Brother...

5
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,912
you're a king now.

6
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:56,381
Rule well...

7
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,750
as Father would have wished.

8
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:04,323
Eirick. Brother!

9
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:12,297
<i>Everybody has a story to tell</i>
<i>about their lives.</i>

10
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,535
<i>My story begins the day I die.</i>

11
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,710
<i>There is in nature</i>
<i>an irregular occurrence</i>

12
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:28,580
<i>when the sun burns red</i>
<i>as the moon crosses its path.</i>

13
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:31,783
<i>This is the Blood Eclipse,</i>

14
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:33,952
<i>a time when a pathway</i>
<i>could be opened</i>

15
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,221
<i>between Heaven, Earth and Hel,</i>

16
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:40,259
<i>which the Vikings called</i>
<i>Valhalla, Mittgard and Helheim.</i>

17
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,895
<i>The Viking gods</i>
<i>used holy relics as keys</i>

18
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:46,165
<i>to unlock the gates</i>
<i>to reign over man.</i>

19
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,484
<i>But over time,</i>
<i>the tale faded into myth.</i>

20
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:07,786
<i>Men abandoned the Viking gods</i>

21
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:11,823
<i>and embraced the new</i>
<i>Christian god and his son.</i>

22
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:12,991
<i>Yet one god,</i>

23
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,260
<i>the God of Thunder,</i>

24
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:16,995
<i>did not forget.</i>

25
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,264
<i>He resolved</i>
<i>to take on human form,</i>

26
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,599
<i>find the keys,</i>

27
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,367
<i>and re-establish</i>
<i>the Viking gods</i>

28
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,303
<i>for all eternity.</i>

29
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,470
Huh?

30
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,838
Row!

31
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,376
Jesus!

32
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:06,078
Norsemen!

33
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,779
Norsemen!

34
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:11,083
Norsemen!
[screaming]

35
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:14,586
Sound the alarm!
Sound the alarm!

36
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,789
Deum de Deo,
lumen de lúmine,

37
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,325
Deum verum de Deo vero,

38
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:25,063
Génitum, non factum,
Consubstantiálem Patri,

39
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:29,534
- Per quem ómnia facta sunt.
- Norseman! Norseman!

40
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:30,969
The Viking Norseman!

41
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,672
They've come for it.

42
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:36,441
Close the door!

43
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,043
[yells]

44
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:40,812
Charge!

45
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,572
[shouts]

46
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:27,626
None enter the abbey before me.

47
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,094
Aye, My Lord.

48
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:30,021
God is our sword.
Faith is our shield.

49
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,901
Where is the abbey?

50
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,970
This way, My Lord.

51
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,189
Begone!
This is the house of God!

52
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:38,523
I am a god!

53
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,959
- Blasphemy!
- Silence!

54
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,567
I am Thor,

55
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:52,304
son of Odin,
brother of Baldur.

56
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,306
I've come for that
which is not yours,

57
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:58,176
nor your one god,
nor his son.

58
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,112
The necklace.

59
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,714
It is a holy relic.

60
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:03,849
Indeed.

61
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,151
It is the necklace
of Mary Magdalene.

62
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,602
You are no god.

63
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,904
You're blood runs
as red as a man's.

64
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,174
Fool.

65
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,576
Even Gods must travel
in the body of flesh,

66
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,578
here in this middle realm.

67
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,982
Was not your own Jesus
pierced and broken?

68
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,126
My Lord, we are ready
to sail with the tide.

69
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,095
Good.

70
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,663
Hmm...

71
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:55,166
I shall give you
what you truly desire,

72
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,769
closer thee to thy god.

73
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,131
[growls]

74
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,366
[growling]

75
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,101
Forgive me, old friend.

76
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,864
State your business.

77
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,438
My Lord Frey.

78
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,540
There's no need for that,
my friend.

79
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:50,408
Rise.

80
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:55,013
God, that stench of bear's
very strong.

81
00:11:55,015 --> 00:11:57,082
Better I stink of his blood
than he of mine.

82
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,084
[chuckles]

83
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:01,219
Eirick Bloodletter.

84
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,222
High Thane of the Jomsberg.

85
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,458
A huntsman.

86
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,260
I was never fond
of that name.

87
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:12,897
Most of your kind would kill
to make such a name.

88
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,373
- Skal.
- Skal.

89
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,318
Eirick...

90
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,254
a decade in these woods,

91
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,823
how have you kept your wits?

92
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:42,293
I would have lost them sooner
had I stayed, My Lord.

93
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,363
And you managed to find
a measure of peace

94
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,565
up here with the bears
and the wolves?

95
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,934
I have.

96
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:51,936
Then my heart is heavy.

97
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:55,807
Then lighten it with
what you came here to say.

98
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:02,580
I bring you news of coming war.

99
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,917
Thor has returned
to the Mittgard

100
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,554
and gathered around him the
Northern Kings of the mortal,

101
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,523
the Trondelag.

102
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,925
There's turmoil in the world.

103
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:21,399
I was there, Eirick...

104
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,036
at the battle before time,

105
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,538
and I've seen what would
become of this world

106
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,440
if the Jotunn Giants
are set loose again.

107
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:33,344
I would not see
such things again.

108
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,615
Thor is here

109
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:40,051
to open the gates
of Valhalla,

110
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:43,488
Mittgard and Helheim.

111
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,223
You must stop it.

112
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,958
How?

113
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,227
I'm a man.

114
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:51,429
I am no match for a god.

115
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,598
But you are not just a man.

116
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,900
You are far more.

117
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:59,470
Ordinary men are not
brought back to life.

118
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,519
My sister gave you
the gift of life

119
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:17,889
because of her love of you.

120
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:22,961
For years, you lit her world
with your love.

121
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,662
The ultimate love.

122
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:28,533
That between a man
and a goddess.

123
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:30,802
She brought you back

124
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:34,372
because she could not bare
the world without you.

125
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,975
She never asked for anything
in return.

126
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,576
Eirick?

127
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,698
Freyja.

128
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,701
Live...

129
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,070
my lover.

130
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,041
Live.

131
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,477
Eirick,
you are now an undead.

132
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:15,580
Only an undead...

133
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:18,216
can pass through Helheim
and return to Mittgard.

134
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:21,486
Not even a god,
not even me,

135
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,988
can enter and return,

136
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,490
but you can.

137
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,194
There is in Helheim
a gilded horn.

138
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:33,097
Now, once blown
in the very face of Thor

139
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,166
will destroy Thor's human flesh

140
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:39,404
and send him back to the place
of spirits where he belongs.

141
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,208
You can choose to deny me.

142
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,478
You can stay here.

143
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,182
But the pathway will be opened
during the coming Blood Eclipse.

144
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,418
Retrieve the horn,

145
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,420
make your way
to the Henge of Stones,

146
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,555
inside the Fort at Trondheim.

147
00:15:57,557 --> 00:16:02,193
Blow the horn there,
and Thor will be defeated.

148
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,799
What you ask of me
is impossible.

149
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:10,301
I would have chosen
a weaker man

150
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,538
had it been a simpler task.

151
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,510
Go first to Osberg.

152
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:22,814
There you will fine a wizard
by the name of Alcuin.

153
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:26,417
He will lead you
to the gates of Hell.

154
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,020
Wind to your back, Viking.

155
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,991
Clear skies above.

156
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:50,608
[grunting]

157
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,201
If you're gonna
stand there and watch,

158
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:20,438
I'd as soon you come here
and give me a hand.

159
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,413
I should've known it was you.

160
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:31,215
Stink of fucking bear shit
for miles.

161
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,418
So I'm told.

162
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,653
I've got to say
it's good to see you,

163
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,556
so bear shit be damned
'cause you're still my king,

164
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,625
even if you do look
like a hermit.

165
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,260
No longer.

166
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,297
I need your boat.

167
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,699
Well, I knew it wasn't
a courtesy call.

168
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,502
Look to be honest with you,
it's not mine anymore.

169
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:54,205
It belongs to another.

170
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:56,407
But I have a feeling
we could work something out.

171
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,477
We'll have to collect it
in Osberg.

172
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:01,145
Osberg?

173
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:02,814
That's where I'm headed
and then to Trondeheim.

174
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:05,316
Well, it's a long way,
so we best get going.

175
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:08,419
No, Sven. This journey of mine,
it's dangerous.

176
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,621
You have a wife,
family, child--

177
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,858
Yeah, and I'm a Viking
first and foremost,

178
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,562
so give me a moment to collect
my things and bid farewell,

179
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,263
and I'll be back.

180
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,569
You know, it's ten years.

181
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,672
Ten years.

182
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,813
I thought you would've showed
your face here before then.

183
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,748
[laughs]

184
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,907
Hey, my friend, can you
give us a ride to Osberg?

185
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:05,576
Osberg? Everyone's
going north, not east.

186
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:08,546
Kings of the Trondelag
are spending silver

187
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:09,780
like they have
a mine of it.

188
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:12,884
Wood, iron, warriors.

189
00:19:12,886 --> 00:19:14,986
Anything that can go north
for war, they buy.

190
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,522
What business of you
in Osberg?

191
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,690
None of your fucking business.

192
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:24,262
Well, can you pay?

193
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,931
Yeah, we can pay you in fur.

194
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,769
If you were virgin girls,
I'd take your fur for pay.

195
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:34,739
Come on.
Give me a hand here.

196
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,577
[horse whinnies]

197
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,717
Help, help, help.

198
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,352
[knocking]

199
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:51,322
- Help!
- There's something inside.

200
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:54,325
Pay no attention to that.
It's just a slave.

201
00:19:57,496 --> 00:19:58,663
What the--

202
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:02,200
Hah! What manner of man
is colored yellow?

203
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,003
Maybe he's a Laplander
or a dwarf.

204
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,905
Way too ugly to be an elf.

205
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,341
Damn you.

206
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:14,679
Enough!

207
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:17,915
Release him.

208
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:19,550
What?

209
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,621
You heard me. Release him.

210
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:35,299
- [chatter]
- [festive music]

211
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,949
That's the one.

212
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,541
Welcome to Osberg.

213
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:21,045
Did you think you could
mess with Ustus and live?

214
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,614
Now put your weapons down,

215
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,750
and you might live
to regret them words.

216
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:29,720
Smart tongues don't waggle
for long. Kill 'em.

217
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:28,346
You free me, I repay debt.
We're even.

218
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,686
It's gotta be worth
keeping the wee man.

219
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,421
Will you join us?

220
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,124
Food.

221
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,431
[laughing]

222
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,636
I'm looking for
King Karl Redbeard.

223
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:54,004
What do you want?

224
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:56,207
Tell him that Eirick Bloodletter
of the Jomsberg's here

225
00:22:56,209 --> 00:22:58,676
and wishes to seek his counsel.

226
00:22:58,678 --> 00:23:00,811
Alcuin the wizard.

227
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:02,613
Strange man.

228
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:05,683
I never really understood
what was in his head.

229
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:08,986
Well, he's no longer with us,
as you can see.

230
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:12,857
I'm afraid you've come
a few moons too late,

231
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:16,227
not that any of us will miss him
very much, I shouldn't think.

232
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,928
What happened?

233
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:22,500
A group of warriors,
Geat warriors they were,

234
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:25,169
came to trade,
not many in number.

235
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:28,706
That was the last
we saw of Alcuin.

236
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:31,776
The Geats, they've taken him
to Gotland.

237
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,677
Yes, Gotland.

238
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,948
They must've taken him
to their leader Heflar.

239
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:41,752
From what I understand,
he's not very fond of visitors,

240
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,187
if you know what I mean.

241
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:48,259
Anyway, if you are sincere
in finding the druid Alcuin,

242
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,728
then you're going to need ships.

243
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:52,496
We have a ship.

244
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:55,099
Well, then you're
going to need men.

245
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,802
You're going to have to cut
your way through there.

246
00:23:57,804 --> 00:24:01,071
Yes, here, here.

247
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:03,240
Thank you, my dear.

248
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:06,210
A pleasure as always.
[laughs]

249
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:08,679
Well, anyway,

250
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:11,549
let me see what I can do to help
you gentlemen out this evening.

251
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:14,618
In the meantime,
let's drink, shall we?

252
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,088
Ahh!

253
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,661
By the way...

254
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:25,463
who's your friend?

255
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,132
We found him.

256
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,868
I think he might be an elf.

257
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:32,803
But he fights like a Valkyrie.

258
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,739
An elf, you say. Well!

259
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:37,808
A big bastard, isn't he?

260
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:40,978
Yang Fu Sun.

261
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,683
Yang? Is that your name?

262
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,020
Eirick.

263
00:24:50,022 --> 00:24:51,188
Sven.

264
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,724
Karl.

265
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,960
Eirick.

266
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:59,129
- Shh-fen.
- That's close enough.

267
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:01,265
Yang.

268
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:04,335
Strange little name
for a strange wee man.

269
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,770
Shh-fen.

270
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:15,880
[crowd cheering]

271
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:19,850
Friends!

272
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,986
Friends!

273
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:25,122
Kinsmen.

274
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,524
Thanes.

275
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,594
Lords.

276
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:32,596
Good fellows all, eh?

277
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:34,732
[laughs]

278
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,934
And the rest of you bastards.

279
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:38,802
[laughter]

280
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:40,838
Well, we have guests.

281
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,842
Guests of great fame
and grim repute.

282
00:25:44,844 --> 00:25:48,045
Welcome Eirick Bloodletter,

283
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:51,248
once King of the Jomsbergs.

284
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,652
That same Eirick

285
00:25:54,654 --> 00:25:58,122
who smashed the Danish army
at Jutland!

286
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:00,758
[murmuring]

287
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,995
Who fought outnumbered
on Zealand.

288
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,897
And...

289
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:12,403
back to back with his great
friend, Sven Stavanger,

290
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:15,839
fought from noon until night.

291
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,910
Eirick Bloodletter,

292
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:23,814
so... beloved...

293
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:27,384
of the great goddess Freyja,

294
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:30,387
that when he was
struck down in battle,

295
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:34,892
he was rised, rised, rised...

296
00:26:34,894 --> 00:26:37,394
by her divine...

297
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:39,697
intervention.

298
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,104
Come now, brother, come.

299
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:49,106
Let us see your face, sir.

300
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:52,710
That face,
that until this night,

301
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:56,113
we have all known
only by legend.

302
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,949
Sir!

303
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,990
I stand here today

304
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:10,094
for a god has asked me
to write a song

305
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:12,329
for people to sing
in years to come.

306
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,132
A somber song it may be.

307
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:18,936
It requires a journey
to Helheim and back.

308
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:20,471
Yet we are Vikings

309
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:24,174
and unafraid of anything
that hell may fling on us.

310
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:28,479
So any man here who would
be a Viking, come.

311
00:27:28,481 --> 00:27:30,881
Follow me.

312
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,791
Not exactly
an inspirational speech.

313
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:42,092
It's been a while.

314
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:43,961
You're telling me.

315
00:27:43,963 --> 00:27:48,298
We're gonna be rowing
our fucking selves to Gotland.

316
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:59,309
I'm Olaf, son of Redbeard.

317
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:00,944
Welcome.

318
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,047
And I am Gregor,
also a Redbeard.

319
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,715
Welcome.

320
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:08,252
Anyone else?

321
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,807
Yomar.

322
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:33,177
I'm a hunter,
and my bow is yours.

323
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,878
Thank you.

324
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,816
I'm called Henrik.

325
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,453
Will there be any fighting?

326
00:28:42,455 --> 00:28:43,921
There will, lad.

327
00:28:43,923 --> 00:28:46,423
Then I'm with you.

328
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:48,092
Any chance of gold?

329
00:28:48,094 --> 00:28:50,561
- [laughter]
- Not really.

330
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:54,798
Well, little enough to be
made here, I suppose.

331
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,433
Can you deal with
an old bugger like me?

332
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,368
We can.

333
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,016
Bernard.

334
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,852
Killer of women and children.

335
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,163
I ask again.

336
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:30,033
Any more men?

337
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,186
Brynna the Fair.

338
00:29:49,188 --> 00:29:52,489
Daughter of Hildegard,
reader of wind.

339
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,026
This is not a quest for a woman.

340
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:58,996
[laughter]

341
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:01,398
Thank you, brothers.

342
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:09,173
A toast! Toast now!

343
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:13,177
To honor, to glory,
to a valiant death

344
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:16,246
and then on to
the hall of heroes. Skal!

345
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,916
Skal!

346
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:26,056
Please, take one of my ships.

347
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:30,327
Not this-- this bucket.

348
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:32,396
- Does it float?
- What do you care?

349
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:34,364
The man promised you
a good death,

350
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:36,233
and drowning is as good
as any other.

351
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:38,468
Olaf's right. We should
take his father's longship.

352
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:41,271
No. In this,
we'll pass unnoticed.

353
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:44,308
Hopefully leave the same way.

354
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:59,156
Sven, I told you
that woman was not to come.

355
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:02,392
- Well, I'm afraid she has to.
- Why?

356
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:05,395
You remember the conversation
we had about the boat?

357
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:08,298
Well, that is the new owner.

358
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,502
And captain.
You're crew on my ship.

359
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:16,440
You'll do as ordered
as any man here will.

360
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:20,210
If you don't like it,
I hope you swim well.

361
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,499
My Lord, we had
nothing but success.

362
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:45,369
We've raided
as far south as España,

363
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:46,737
across the Angle Sea,

364
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:50,707
and down their rivers
as far as the village of Paris.

365
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,443
But still no word on
the Horn of Helheim.

366
00:31:56,381 --> 00:32:01,718
Whoever possesses the horn
possesses the power to stop me.

367
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,755
My Lord, I cannot see how.

368
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:07,624
Our warriors and our ships
are ready.

369
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:10,027
Christianity lies at our feet.

370
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:15,299
With you, a god made man,
nothing can stop us.

371
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,503
Even a god can be stopped.

372
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:38,522
I know you had no choice
to take me.

373
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:42,526
But I will say this wind
won't abate anytime soon.

374
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:46,096
What does a woman know
about winds and waves?

375
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,665
As much as anyone whose
mother died in childbirth

376
00:32:48,667 --> 00:32:50,767
and whose father took her
on the longboats.

377
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:54,438
I have sailed the great seas
to Angle Isle and Greenland

378
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,275
and woven a course
between mountains of ice.

379
00:32:58,277 --> 00:33:01,445
I've been shipwrecked
on the Great Island

380
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:06,149
and almost died of thirst,
becalmed on the Sea of Sighs.

381
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,319
Perhaps voyaging to Helheim
will be easier than that.

382
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,455
You can still get it wrong.

383
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:14,391
I say by nightfall,
we'll all be rowing.

384
00:33:14,393 --> 00:33:16,660
And I say we won't.

385
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:45,822
- [whispering]
- Hmm.

386
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:50,761
We go to far Gotland,
to the Fjord of Jorgumandr.

387
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:53,130
Wolfred, get fifty men.

388
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,367
You!
Guard the Henge of Stones.

389
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:59,436
It has begun.

390
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:14,651
EIRICK: <i>I can feel</i>
<i>the bad blood.</i>

391
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:16,686
<i>That's what you get</i>
<i>when there are strangers</i>

392
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:18,722
<i>sleeping next to you.</i>

393
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:22,692
<i>I can smell the stench</i>
<i>of a traitor amongst us.</i>

394
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,449
Men are just so full of wind.

395
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:51,521
Eirick, Eirick.

396
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:58,862
Land ho, elf eyes.

397
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:07,170
Gotland. We're here.

398
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:57,888
This is way too quiet
for my liking.

399
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,224
Stay close.

400
00:36:22,947 --> 00:36:24,814
[scream]

401
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:27,551
[shouting]

402
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:54,711
I got one.

403
00:38:38,549 --> 00:38:40,417
Henrik!

404
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,454
To Helheim!

405
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,539
Bloodletter!

406
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:19,022
Eirick!

407
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:34,404
The broach is up there.

408
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,518
God, what a jail.

409
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,188
Prison for a wizard
of the earth.

410
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,791
No contact with the ground.

411
00:39:54,793 --> 00:39:56,726
Are you Alcuin?

412
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,931
Heflar of the Geats
was many things.

413
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:05,034
None of them virtuous,
most of them cunning.

414
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,103
I have you to thank
for his death,

415
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:10,206
Thane of Jomsberg.

416
00:40:10,208 --> 00:40:12,175
You know of me, wizard?

417
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:17,947
I saw the possibility
of your arrival.

418
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:20,183
Will you let me down?

419
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:24,888
If you promise to take me
to the gates of Helheim.

420
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,691
Any man may find those gates.

421
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:30,927
Most eventually do.

422
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,629
I plan on returning.

423
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:36,199
None who cross that bridge
may ever return,

424
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:38,234
Thane of Jomsberg.

425
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:40,670
The dead know me
as one of their own.

426
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:47,610
Ah!

427
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:51,047
Freyja's mortal lover.

428
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:53,817
I heard tell,
but did not believe.

429
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,587
I hear many things
from many voices,

430
00:40:57,589 --> 00:41:00,056
Eirick Bloodletter.

431
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:02,759
Will you help me?

432
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:05,195
I'll show you the way.

433
00:41:05,197 --> 00:41:08,765
Close it is to any man's heart
that truly seeks it.

434
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,739
Lower me, please.

435
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:19,676
Please.
Please let me down.

436
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:55,979
Soldiers come from the north.

437
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:57,714
Many horses.

438
00:41:57,716 --> 00:42:01,551
You have powerful enemies,
Thane Eirick.

439
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:11,261
Come, wizard.
Time is against us.

440
00:43:40,818 --> 00:43:42,051
A wizard was kept there, sire.

441
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:44,787
It was as you said:
an iron cage, no roof.

442
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:46,789
Good.

443
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,392
Now we shall see
if he's all you think he is.

444
00:43:49,394 --> 00:43:50,994
Who is this wretch?

445
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:57,166
My-- My Lord...

446
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:59,202
raider ship...

447
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:01,170
killed our men,

448
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:06,809
killed our great King Heflar,

449
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,445
took the druid.

450
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:11,748
Who took the druid?

451
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:16,719
I heard the druid
call him by his name,

452
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:20,390
Eirick,
Thane of Jomsberg.

453
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:24,327
Heflar called him...

454
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,095
Bloodletter.

455
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:30,233
Eirick Bloodletter.
A fine name.

456
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:31,934
You know him, sire?

457
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:34,270
We return to Trondheim.
It is done.

458
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:37,240
My Lord, surely we should
pursue them.

459
00:44:37,242 --> 00:44:39,375
No.

460
00:44:39,377 --> 00:44:42,378
He will come for me.

461
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,350
How much further?

462
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:49,118
Oh, not far now.

463
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,392
In Helheim, there are many
things you must beware of,

464
00:44:56,394 --> 00:44:59,762
but one thing
you cannot avoid.

465
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:03,032
At the gate of Helheim
lies a massive hound,

466
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,268
a hound called Garm.

467
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:08,171
He has no eyes, but he can
smell out the living

468
00:45:08,173 --> 00:45:10,239
and the dead.

469
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:12,408
You may not escape.

470
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:21,818
It is there!

471
00:45:26,457 --> 00:45:28,124
How do I reach it?

472
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:29,992
Swim far and deep.

473
00:45:29,994 --> 00:45:32,929
Follow the current
as it gets colder and colder,

474
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:34,464
to the very depths.

475
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:38,000
There you will see the gates.

476
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:40,103
Eirick, you sure about this?
It's madness.

477
00:45:40,105 --> 00:45:42,105
Aye! Madness it is.

478
00:45:42,107 --> 00:45:44,173
All bravery is.

479
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:47,410
You're gonna need tallow.

480
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,892
Are you scared?

481
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,195
Terrified.

482
00:46:06,197 --> 00:46:07,530
You should be.

483
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,602
I don't know if you're
the bravest man I've ever met

484
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,871
or the biggest fool.

485
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:24,247
If I don't return by sunup,
go home.

486
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:26,315
You just make sure
you come back.

487
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:28,551
Eirick go?

488
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:29,886
Eirick go.

489
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:31,087
Yang no go?

490
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:32,522
Yang no go.

491
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,626
Full wind with you,
my friend.

492
00:46:36,628 --> 00:46:38,961
Clear skies above.

493
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,599
ALCUIN: <i>Swim far and deep.</i>

494
00:47:16,601 --> 00:47:19,502
<i>Follow the current</i>
<i>as it gets colder and colder,</i>

495
00:47:19,504 --> 00:47:21,170
<i>to the very depths.</i>

496
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,306
<i>There you will see the gates.</i>

497
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:41,557
[gasping]

498
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:36,612
[low growling]

499
00:49:44,214 --> 00:49:47,183
[screaming]

500
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:21,784
Father.

501
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:26,355
Of all the torment
in this place,

502
00:50:26,357 --> 00:50:30,526
none has caused me more pain
than seeing you here.

503
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:33,329
I always believed you'd stand
at the right hand of Odin.

504
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,767
I was a picture of a king.

505
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:39,769
A coward of worst kind.

506
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,339
Too afraid to live.

507
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:46,876
The door of Heaven
never opened for me.

508
00:50:46,878 --> 00:50:50,679
Here I've been,
here I shall stand.

509
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:54,283
How did you know I was here?

510
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:56,819
A whisper in my ear.

511
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:01,891
This is a place for torment.

512
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:05,428
A settling of account.

513
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:09,231
Eirick, you are not my son.

514
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,734
Lies.

515
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,869
We are the dead!

516
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:16,172
Lies offer no comfort here.

517
00:51:16,174 --> 00:51:19,508
Truly you're not my son.

518
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,544
Your mother never knew.

519
00:51:21,546 --> 00:51:24,480
He came, had my face,
my image,

520
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:27,249
and she was deceived.

521
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:32,521
You are my father,
whether you seeded me or not.

522
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:37,460
Why are you here?!

523
00:51:37,462 --> 00:51:39,428
I seek the Horn of Helheim.

524
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:42,598
And then?!

525
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,700
Then I will return.

526
00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:47,236
No, my son.

527
00:51:47,238 --> 00:51:50,439
You will remain here
among the dead forever.

528
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,342
Not without a fight.

529
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:57,480
That's the difference between
the living and the dead.

530
00:51:57,482 --> 00:51:59,482
Hope.

531
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,852
Will you help me find it?

532
00:52:02,854 --> 00:52:04,653
Hmm...

533
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:11,494
You will find the horn
within the Gate of Souls.

534
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:20,202
[moaning]

535
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:27,610
[moaning continues]

536
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,673
Alive.

537
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,649
Stay with us.

538
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:12,588
Forever.

539
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:26,035
Father, now!

540
00:53:26,037 --> 00:53:29,405
[yelling]

541
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:31,373
Damn you!

542
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:34,210
[yells]
You will not have him!

543
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:49,024
Maybe we should go.

544
00:53:49,026 --> 00:53:52,294
What need have we with Helheim?

545
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:56,065
He said it himself. If he
doesn't return by sunrise--

546
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:58,300
Yeah, I know what he said.

547
00:53:58,302 --> 00:54:00,469
But the ship stays on course,
and so do you.

548
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:04,273
I say we leave!
Who's with me?

549
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:08,844
He's been in there
the whole night.

550
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:10,646
He's probably dead by now.

551
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:13,082
How many more of us
do you want killed?

552
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:14,617
Coward.

553
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:17,653
Where is your honor?

554
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:21,523
You're a killer of women
and children.

555
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:24,860
What do you know of honor?

556
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:28,297
All my life, I was a farmer.

557
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:33,936
But then the raiders came.

558
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:38,340
Blood of these same Geat cowards
we killed yesterday.

559
00:54:39,676 --> 00:54:42,077
Burned down my farm,

560
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:44,947
my father's home,

561
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:49,018
killed my wife
and my children.

562
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:53,589
Carved me hollow,

563
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:56,458
left me blank,

564
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,528
so the only thing I crave
is the death I deserve.

565
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,401
So I killed those raiders.

566
00:55:05,403 --> 00:55:08,103
I killed them all.

567
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:11,740
I killed their wives.

568
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:13,909
I killed their children.

569
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:17,613
Burned their homes
and their ships.

570
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:19,782
And I listen to their screams

571
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:23,419
as they watched their seed
wiped from the middle kingdom.

572
00:55:29,392 --> 00:55:32,494
They meant to take
all that I had,

573
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:36,498
but their could not
take my honor.

574
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:40,469
And I'd rather die with honor
than to live a coward.

575
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:44,106
That's a man spoken
like a true Viking.

576
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:47,209
We wait.

577
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:50,145
Wait. Look out for Garm,
the Hound of Helheim.

578
00:55:50,147 --> 00:55:51,947
He is the gatekeeper.

579
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:55,150
I past it before.
He let me through.

580
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:59,021
Just because he lets you in
doesn't mean he'll let you out.

581
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:12,067
[growling]

582
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:13,736
Run!

583
00:56:13,738 --> 00:56:14,970
[growls]

584
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:43,165
We can't outrun him.
He can smell your blood.

585
00:56:44,734 --> 00:56:46,168
Turn around.

586
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,437
Turn around, boy!

587
00:56:54,177 --> 00:56:56,612
Think well me, always.

588
00:57:00,016 --> 00:57:01,950
I am here!

589
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:03,886
Raahh!

590
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,692
Think well of me, son.

591
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:45,994
Always.

592
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,702
Things aren't always
as they seem, my love.

593
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,607
You must blow the horn
in the face of Thor to stop him.

594
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:04,646
[gasps]

595
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,884
[horn blowing]

596
00:58:08,886 --> 00:58:10,052
Brynna, wake up.

597
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:15,057
He's there!

598
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:28,270
- Eirick.
- Brother.

599
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:29,938
- Eirick. Brother
- Eirick.

600
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,174
- Eirick.
- Eirick.

601
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:35,210
- Eirick.
- Huh?

602
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,623
So you're back.

603
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:53,729
Are you gonna be all right?

604
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:01,203
Eirick, sit down
and drink this.

605
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,278
I saw my father.

606
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,680
No, you never.

607
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:14,850
What you saw was some type
of spirit made in his image.

608
00:59:14,852 --> 00:59:17,152
No. It was him.

609
00:59:17,154 --> 00:59:19,221
He told me I wasn't his son.

610
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:21,223
Well, that can't be true,
can it?

611
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:23,125
I grew up with you,

612
00:59:23,127 --> 00:59:24,793
and I know your face,
and I know his,

613
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:27,062
and he is your father
for sure.

614
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:31,667
It makes no sense.
It makes no sense.

615
00:59:31,669 --> 00:59:35,938
But you got what you went for.

616
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,106
You did it.

617
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:42,978
If only I knew
what she gave me

618
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:46,081
when she gave me
the gift of life,

619
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:50,218
I would've lived, Sven.
I swear I would've lived.

620
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:53,889
Yeah, but it's
not over yet, is it?

621
00:59:53,891 --> 00:59:54,990
No.

622
00:59:54,992 --> 00:59:57,993
So let me say something.

623
00:59:57,995 --> 01:00:02,898
Something I should've said
a long, long time ago.

624
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:05,267
I've never met a man
so brave

625
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:07,803
and so afraid to be
what he actually is.

626
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:09,638
Eirick, listen to me.

627
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,909
You are a great man.

628
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:18,447
You were born to lead men,
to inspire men.

629
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:21,183
But ever since I've known you,
all you've ever done

630
01:00:21,185 --> 01:00:24,119
is try and prove that you're
just like everybody else,

631
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:26,722
but you're not.

632
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:32,427
I am pleased to see you,
My Lord.

633
01:00:32,429 --> 01:00:34,463
I doubted you would return,

634
01:00:34,465 --> 01:00:38,700
and I did my best to turn aside
the crew and sail for home,

635
01:00:38,702 --> 01:00:40,335
My Lord.

636
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:43,905
Warick, you seem so frightened.

637
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:46,875
Often the most cautious
are the most wise.

638
01:00:46,877 --> 01:00:47,976
Warick the Wise.

639
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:51,013
There's a fine name
for a Viking.

640
01:00:51,015 --> 01:00:52,180
Welcome back.

641
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:57,953
Did you decide?

642
01:00:57,955 --> 01:00:58,987
What?

643
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:01,390
Am I brave or a fool?

644
01:01:01,392 --> 01:01:02,824
Both.

645
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:14,002
I have to blow this horn
in the face of Thor.

646
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:16,772
Tell me what I should do.

647
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:20,809
He will be at Trondheim
at the Henge of Stones.

648
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:21,877
For the Blood Eclipse?

649
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:24,513
Yes, but you will have

650
01:01:24,515 --> 01:01:28,116
the gathered armies
of the Trondelag to face.

651
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:30,519
We have an army.

652
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:33,155
It's been a very long time.

653
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:34,890
Mm.

654
01:01:34,892 --> 01:01:37,426
You think your brother's
gonna be glad to see you?

655
01:01:37,428 --> 01:01:39,161
No.

656
01:01:39,163 --> 01:01:41,263
EIRICK: <i>So Eirick</i>
<i>the Bloodletter</i>

657
01:01:41,265 --> 01:01:44,232
<i>has became Eirick</i>
<i>the Harrower of Hell.</i>

658
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:47,035
<i>But my story is far from over.</i>

659
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:50,305
<i>I now have to make a journey</i>
<i>to the place I dread most.</i>

660
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:51,773
<i>Home.</i>

661
01:01:51,775 --> 01:01:55,210
<i>With the horn and protection</i>
<i>of Lord Frey and Frejya,</i>

662
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,012
<i>I believe all would be well,</i>

663
01:01:57,014 --> 01:01:59,281
<i>and the Jomsberg would</i>
<i>fight with me once more.</i>

664
01:01:59,283 --> 01:02:01,383
<i>But nothing prepared me</i>
<i>for the biggest betrayal</i>

665
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:03,819
<i>that is yet to come.</i>

666
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:14,796
Sven, drop the anchor.

667
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,403
Look! Jomsberg!

668
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,282
This doesn't feel right.

669
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:36,384
Not all of us should go.

670
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:39,421
I'll stay behind,
if it pleases you.

671
01:02:39,423 --> 01:02:41,423
Perhaps you'll keep Yang.

672
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,191
He's a prize to men
who keep slaves.

673
01:02:43,193 --> 01:02:45,827
That will be safe with me.

674
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,199
Yang no go?

675
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,336
Good.

676
01:02:54,338 --> 01:02:56,538
Brynna, you stay behind.

677
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,807
Keep in eye on Alcuin.

678
01:03:02,178 --> 01:03:05,013
State your business. This is
the fortress of Jomsberg.

679
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:06,915
We suffer no visitors.

680
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:08,517
You suffer no visitors?

681
01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:10,285
What if that visitor
pulled your unconscious body

682
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:12,921
out of the Sea of Zealand?

683
01:03:12,923 --> 01:03:15,624
Eirick? Is that you?

684
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:17,225
It is.

685
01:03:17,227 --> 01:03:19,628
Welcome home, My Lord.

686
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:22,531
Good to see you, old friend.

687
01:03:22,533 --> 01:03:24,499
Hardly a moon goes by
when our swords

688
01:03:24,501 --> 01:03:28,103
don't wet the ground with
some poor bastard's claret.

689
01:03:28,105 --> 01:03:30,438
We only fight for gold now.

690
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:33,041
Not like the old days.

691
01:03:33,043 --> 01:03:34,976
No more rushing off
for desperate battles

692
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:36,578
with terrible odds.

693
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,480
No more raids.

694
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:40,315
What would your father say,

695
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:43,985
the Jomsberg, mercenaries
to the highest bidder?

696
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:13,081
I'll not be questioned by you
in this hall again, Jorgen!

697
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:15,250
If you don't like it,

698
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:17,385
then give back
your share and go!

699
01:04:17,387 --> 01:04:22,090
My Lord Beothric
and great captains of Jomsberg,

700
01:04:22,092 --> 01:04:26,194
I present Eirick,
son of Alfred.

701
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:35,303
Let my brother step forward.

702
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:42,043
Beothric.

703
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,980
- Brother.
- Eirick.

704
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:48,683
I never thought I'd see you
in this hall again.

705
01:04:48,685 --> 01:04:51,319
I never thought to come.

706
01:04:51,321 --> 01:04:55,123
But now that I have...

707
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:56,524
it feels good.

708
01:04:56,526 --> 01:04:59,327
But I have to say

709
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:01,463
your hospitality leaves
a little bit to be desired.

710
01:05:01,465 --> 01:05:04,165
You've not offered us
even a sip of water,

711
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:06,167
let alone a drop
of the hard stuff.

712
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:10,739
We drink mead in this hall
to celebrate and to mourn.

713
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:14,309
Your being here
is cause for neither.

714
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:18,346
We were warned you'd come.

715
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:21,583
Come here to take back
the throne of our father?

716
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:23,385
Brother, no.

717
01:05:23,387 --> 01:05:27,255
But then,
look around you, brother.

718
01:05:29,191 --> 01:05:32,460
See the poor trappings
of our father's era?

719
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:38,066
No. No, you do not.

720
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:44,005
20,000 gold coins I'm paid
by the Byzantine emperor

721
01:05:44,007 --> 01:05:46,508
for a squadron
of our warriors.

722
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:52,247
Arthur of the Angles
pays me 30,000 in silver

723
01:05:52,249 --> 01:05:56,117
so that I may keep
his throne safe.

724
01:05:56,119 --> 01:06:00,055
For I, the younger
and lesser brother

725
01:06:00,057 --> 01:06:02,390
sits on this throne,

726
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:04,592
and our kingdom is rich.

727
01:06:04,594 --> 01:06:07,495
And now you come.

728
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:09,297
You're mistaken, brother.

729
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:11,132
I did not return
for the crown.

730
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:12,701
Instead I've been
asked by the gods

731
01:06:12,703 --> 01:06:15,370
to take on a battle
with impossible odds.

732
01:06:15,372 --> 01:06:17,672
- With whom?
- The god Thor.

733
01:06:17,674 --> 01:06:20,241
Thor?

734
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:24,546
Just because he came back
from the dead,

735
01:06:24,548 --> 01:06:28,249
he thinks he can take on
the God of Thunder?

736
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:31,186
I came here to ask
for your help,

737
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:32,754
not to be mocked.

738
01:06:32,756 --> 01:06:33,989
Let's go.

739
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:38,293
No, brother, I cannot
allow you to leave.

740
01:06:38,295 --> 01:06:43,631
A listening ear
for all who despise my reign,

741
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:47,502
a figurehead for those
who would overthrow me?

742
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,237
Forgive me, brother.

743
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:51,940
Take them away!

744
01:06:51,942 --> 01:06:56,411
Search them and bring
whatever you find to me.

745
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:05,120
I'm sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

746
01:07:05,122 --> 01:07:08,089
Why don't you just give
Lord Beothric what he wants?

747
01:07:08,091 --> 01:07:10,692
Then we don't have to do this.

748
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:43,758
Someone's approaching,
and it's not one of us.

749
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:58,273
You are friends
of My Lord Eirick?

750
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:01,409
We are.

751
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:04,913
Then know this:
He has been betrayed.

752
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:07,215
He and his fellows
are in the dungeon.

753
01:08:07,217 --> 01:08:09,584
I might get you
into the keep,

754
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:13,555
but by oath, I cannot raise
a sword against my brothers.

755
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:18,359
But you might get him out,
get him back to the boat.

756
01:08:18,361 --> 01:08:20,562
Eirick needs us.

757
01:08:20,564 --> 01:08:23,264
- Eirick need Yang?
- Yes.

758
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:25,900
These Jomsberg
are no brawlers, my lass.

759
01:08:25,902 --> 01:08:27,602
They're the finest warriors
on earth.

760
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:30,839
Good. Arrogant men fall easiest.

761
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:50,825
We'll not pass
that courtyard unseen.

762
01:08:50,827 --> 01:08:54,229
I wouldn't be so glum,
good Yorik.

763
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:08,743
Alcuin, hurry up.

764
01:09:08,745 --> 01:09:12,213
Go! I will join you
in due time.

765
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:24,559
[muttering]

766
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:31,232
[muttering]

767
01:09:46,982 --> 01:09:48,983
This leads
straight to the dungeons.

768
01:09:48,985 --> 01:09:51,252
Your friends are down there.

769
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:17,979
The king is sending us north
with a slave for barter.

770
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,750
[chatter]

771
01:10:22,752 --> 01:10:24,819
- Do you hear that?
- Shh!

772
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:47,769
Brynna! Good?

773
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:50,672
Yes, Yang, I'm fine. You?

774
01:11:50,674 --> 01:11:53,608
I'm fine. Come.

775
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,864
- Open the gate.
- Fuck you, whore!

776
01:12:18,934 --> 01:12:21,502
Open the door.
Open the door!

777
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:23,471
Whatever you say, my lady.

778
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,111
Hey, it's the little man.

779
01:12:30,113 --> 01:12:31,846
Yang good?

780
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,047
No, Yang,
you're fucking brilliant.

781
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:34,048
Where's Eirick?

782
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:35,783
Next cell.

783
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:53,835
Oh...

784
01:13:09,017 --> 01:13:13,654
By Odin's blind eye,
what have they done to you?

785
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:23,965
Brynna, where's the horn?

786
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,733
With Alcuin.

787
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:28,469
Where is he?

788
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:56,531
The druid and the horn,
where are they?

789
01:13:56,533 --> 01:13:58,499
Cut them down.

790
01:13:58,501 --> 01:14:01,669
I'd stay still if I were you,
My Lord.

791
01:14:01,671 --> 01:14:03,838
See how he betrays
his brother?

792
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,908
May he not treat you the same.

793
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:10,478
What did Thor offer you
to betray me?

794
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:18,553
Why, all of the Angle Isles
to rule as I see fit.

795
01:14:18,555 --> 01:14:20,254
You see, brother,

796
01:14:20,256 --> 01:14:22,790
you're not the only one
with the counsel of the gods.

797
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:25,760
You can keep your Angle Isles
and the throne.

798
01:14:25,762 --> 01:14:27,728
But understand this.

799
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:31,199
When I have subdued Thor,
I will come back for you,

800
01:14:31,201 --> 01:14:33,201
and we will have
our reckoning.

801
01:14:33,203 --> 01:14:37,972
It is you who does not
understand, brother.

802
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:42,777
The horn itself
commands the highest price.

803
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:45,713
Without it, you're worthless.

804
01:14:45,715 --> 01:14:48,049
King of Jomsberg!

805
01:14:49,084 --> 01:14:51,552
Would this be what you seek?

806
01:14:51,554 --> 01:14:54,088
You bastard! Traitor!

807
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:58,659
My, my.

808
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:01,529
This is a fine thing.

809
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:07,268
You see, brother,
the message was very simple.

810
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:09,070
Your brother's coming,

811
01:15:09,072 --> 01:15:12,773
and he carries
the Horn of Helheim.

812
01:15:12,775 --> 01:15:16,077
Retrieve it and capture him.

813
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:20,114
And with the help
of your friend here, I have.

814
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:26,687
So now it's time
for my reckoning with you.

815
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:29,357
Take him away.

816
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:32,560
Treat him as befits a royal.
Use a sword.

817
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:36,731
Throw the rest of a cliff.

818
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:42,169
Druid, come.
Drink with me.

819
01:15:42,171 --> 01:15:44,705
I thought there was
a traitor amongst us.

820
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:45,940
It's Alcuin the wizard.

821
01:15:45,942 --> 01:15:49,777
He owes us his life.
How could he do that?

822
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:52,680
In return for Beothric's gold.

823
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:03,691
My Lord, we are with you.

824
01:16:03,693 --> 01:16:05,826
We will take you away from
this place and give you shelter.

825
01:16:05,828 --> 01:16:07,328
We will also gather
our group of men

826
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:08,896
to join you
to fight the Trondelag.

827
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:10,665
What about the other captains?

828
01:16:10,667 --> 01:16:12,199
For them, it's treason.

829
01:16:49,705 --> 01:16:52,139
That looks like it hurts.

830
01:16:54,076 --> 01:16:55,610
Let me.

831
01:17:00,782 --> 01:17:02,950
If this quest goes on
too much longer,

832
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:05,052
there won't be
much of you left.

833
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:08,022
We've lost the horn.

834
01:17:08,024 --> 01:17:10,424
The odds are against us.

835
01:17:10,426 --> 01:17:14,228
Could we not fight
without it?

836
01:17:14,230 --> 01:17:17,832
The horn is the only thing
that can stop Thor.

837
01:17:17,834 --> 01:17:21,636
Maybe I have no right
to ask the men to go on.

838
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:24,739
Or you.

839
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:32,747
I know you said you would ask
no more of me than any man,

840
01:17:32,749 --> 01:17:35,483
but what if I wanted
to give you...

841
01:17:35,485 --> 01:17:37,985
what only a woman can?

842
01:17:43,225 --> 01:17:45,926
Brynna...

843
01:17:45,928 --> 01:17:50,031
I promised my heart to another
many years ago.

844
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:02,243
I wondered how I ever loved
such a human fool.

845
01:18:02,245 --> 01:18:03,244
Freyja?

846
01:18:03,246 --> 01:18:05,413
No.

847
01:18:05,415 --> 01:18:08,482
Be still there.

848
01:18:08,484 --> 01:18:11,185
Don't turn around.

849
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:16,223
We are far from one another
right now,

850
01:18:16,225 --> 01:18:19,026
but through this
I can speak.

851
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:33,374
I barter myself with the gods...

852
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:36,277
so that you might live again.

853
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:41,916
But your life
came with a condition,

854
01:18:41,918 --> 01:18:46,220
that you and I...

855
01:18:46,222 --> 01:18:48,522
can never experience
love again.

856
01:18:48,524 --> 01:18:52,393
But at least you lived.

857
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:56,797
I'd rather be dead
than live my life without you.

858
01:18:56,799 --> 01:18:58,499
You must.

859
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:19,453
I brought you back...

860
01:19:19,455 --> 01:19:23,357
so that you should live.

861
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:26,026
We can no longer be.

862
01:19:26,028 --> 01:19:28,562
Eirick...

863
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:31,298
stop living in memories.

864
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:34,902
If a man spends his life
looking backwards,

865
01:19:34,904 --> 01:19:37,938
he'll miss what's
right in front of him.

866
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:41,375
And what is
right in front of me?

867
01:19:41,377 --> 01:19:43,110
Hope.

868
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:47,047
A chance for joy,

869
01:19:47,049 --> 01:19:49,350
happiness.

870
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:51,952
A chance for the one thing

871
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:56,924
that mortals have
that the gods desire:

872
01:19:56,926 --> 01:19:59,360
love.

873
01:19:59,362 --> 01:20:01,428
It's no shame to love again.

874
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:06,901
For what little time is left,
Thor has--

875
01:20:06,903 --> 01:20:09,904
Then fight for
your right to tomorrow.

876
01:20:09,906 --> 01:20:11,972
Fight...

877
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:15,509
so that your name
is whistled down the ages

878
01:20:15,511 --> 01:20:17,978
as a name for goodness,

879
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,314
for worth,

880
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:22,183
and for light.

881
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:45,539
I'm-- I'm sorry.

882
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,009
I-I didn't mean to.

883
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,946
If you take me, I'm yours.

884
01:20:54,182 --> 01:20:56,317
I'll think about it,
My Lord.

885
01:21:41,429 --> 01:21:43,464
I know that look
on a man's face.

886
01:21:43,466 --> 01:21:45,199
Amazing what
a good night's sleep can do.

887
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:47,468
More like a night
not sleeping.

888
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:49,536
There's your army, My Lord.

889
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:07,988
You do your men
and Jomsberg proud.

890
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:10,190
This will be a great battle.

891
01:22:10,192 --> 01:22:12,493
They'll sing songs about
the few that went to Trondheim

892
01:22:12,495 --> 01:22:15,696
and smashed
the armies of the god.

893
01:22:15,698 --> 01:22:19,199
Men, we leave soon,
before Beothric finds out!

894
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:31,478
Forgive us, sire.

895
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,048
We have traitors in our midst.

896
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:40,287
Some of our brothers have
sided with your brother, sire.

897
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:57,972
The king is dead.

898
01:23:01,076 --> 01:23:02,242
The druid.

899
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:16,390
What are they to do
with only a few hundred men?

900
01:23:16,392 --> 01:23:18,759
They are the Jomsberg.

901
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:22,096
Who knows what they'll do?

902
01:23:22,098 --> 01:23:24,298
I care little.

903
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,799
Tomorrow I shall have
the horn,

904
01:23:25,801 --> 01:23:27,401
and no army
in this middle kingdom

905
01:23:27,403 --> 01:23:28,869
will be able to stop me.

906
01:23:28,871 --> 01:23:34,375
The Gates of Valhalla, Mittgard
and Helheim will swing wide.

907
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:38,679
My Lord, what is this plan?

908
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:39,813
What are you saying?

909
01:23:39,815 --> 01:23:41,682
I shall open the pathway...

910
01:23:41,684 --> 01:23:44,385
to open the gates
of Heaven and Hell.

911
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:46,453
It will wreak havoc
upon our world.

912
01:23:49,124 --> 01:23:52,459
I care little for your world.

913
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:57,264
Thousands of our people
will die.

914
01:23:57,266 --> 01:24:01,468
These people fell our fields,
build our ships.

915
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:04,338
Surely you cannot be unaware of
the havoc that this will cause.

916
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:06,740
Fool! Of course I am aware.

917
01:24:06,742 --> 01:24:09,877
Only by my forging mayhem
upon the world

918
01:24:09,879 --> 01:24:14,314
can the Christian god
be destroyed forever.

919
01:24:14,316 --> 01:24:16,850
This is not about
our Viking quests

920
01:24:16,852 --> 01:24:19,153
or extending our realm.

921
01:24:19,155 --> 01:24:22,689
It's about you and the gods
at the expense of mortals.

922
01:24:22,691 --> 01:24:26,527
What care have I for mortals?
I am a god.

923
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:28,429
You may care little, My Lord,

924
01:24:28,431 --> 01:24:32,366
but I'll not you lead us
into our own destruction!

925
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:54,655
You forgot one thing.

926
01:24:58,893 --> 01:25:01,462
Only those
with the blood of gods

927
01:25:01,464 --> 01:25:03,497
can use the weapons
of the gods.

928
01:25:05,667 --> 01:25:08,669
You, Wolfred...

929
01:25:08,671 --> 01:25:11,705
suffer from a lack of vision.

930
01:25:11,707 --> 01:25:14,274
Kings of the North,
prepare your men.

931
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:17,344
The battle for the middle
kingdom starts at sunrise.

932
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:20,347
Captain.

933
01:25:22,484 --> 01:25:27,588
I name you King of Nordland,
in place of Wolfred.

934
01:26:49,270 --> 01:26:51,738
[pants]
So many.

935
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:55,008
Your men probe the shield wall
right to left

936
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:56,877
and throw our full weight
on the left flank

937
01:26:56,879 --> 01:26:58,745
once the wall has broke.

938
01:26:58,747 --> 01:27:00,614
- And if we break it?
- Then we push through.

939
01:27:00,616 --> 01:27:02,783
And if Thor shows up
before then?

940
01:27:02,785 --> 01:27:06,320
I'll shall call him out,
and we'll fight to the death.

941
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:14,828
The eclipse.

942
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:16,897
It will begin soon.

943
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:21,301
Men, we camp here
for the night.

944
01:27:44,392 --> 01:27:49,363
Men of Jomsberg,
Vikings, brothers...

945
01:27:50,865 --> 01:27:53,066
across the ridge
is the army of the north,

946
01:27:53,068 --> 01:27:55,102
more than a thousand strong.

947
01:27:55,104 --> 01:27:58,538
We are but a few.
Five to one.

948
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:01,541
If you wish,
I'll ride to their captains

949
01:28:01,543 --> 01:28:05,712
and ask for an extra day
so they can gather more men.

950
01:28:05,714 --> 01:28:08,749
It only seems fair.

951
01:28:08,751 --> 01:28:11,451
Some of you know me.

952
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:13,887
Some of you have bled with me.

953
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:20,927
Some of you have heard
tall tales of battles won,

954
01:28:20,929 --> 01:28:24,564
of gods and goddesses.

955
01:28:24,566 --> 01:28:26,967
This is me,
Eirick of Jomsberg,

956
01:28:26,969 --> 01:28:29,036
and my song is
not yet finished.

957
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:34,608
The measure of a man is not
measured in his battles won,

958
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:37,511
the dead by his swords,
or the gold he has stored away.

959
01:28:37,513 --> 01:28:39,913
A man is measured
by his courage,

960
01:28:39,915 --> 01:28:41,915
his devotion to family,

961
01:28:41,917 --> 01:28:44,484
his willingness
to grab his destiny.

962
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:45,852
If we do not fight this day,

963
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:47,654
there will be
a generation of terror,

964
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:52,059
and the gods will unleash
horrors of the old age.

965
01:28:52,061 --> 01:28:55,529
Today you do not
fight for yourself.

966
01:28:55,531 --> 01:28:58,598
Today...

967
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:04,805
you fight for your wives,
your sons, your daughters.

968
01:29:04,807 --> 01:29:07,874
If you should die this day,

969
01:29:07,876 --> 01:29:10,811
die with the faith that you
have stood shield to shield

970
01:29:10,813 --> 01:29:13,680
with your brothers.

971
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:16,083
And die as a Viking should,

972
01:29:16,085 --> 01:29:18,085
with honor.

973
01:29:19,053 --> 01:29:20,821
Come.

974
01:29:24,959 --> 01:29:26,426
Follow me!

975
01:29:26,428 --> 01:29:29,129
[cheering]

976
01:29:33,668 --> 01:29:35,602
Now that's more like it.

977
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:43,877
[man shouting commands]

978
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:49,883
They don't stand a chance
against our mighty army.

979
01:29:49,885 --> 01:29:51,485
Take position!

980
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,821
To the wall!

981
01:29:54,823 --> 01:29:58,725
[rumbling]

982
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:00,727
[shouting]

983
01:30:07,468 --> 01:30:09,836
Fire!

984
01:30:09,838 --> 01:30:11,571
Take cover!

985
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:19,780
First wave, form a new line!

986
01:30:38,566 --> 01:30:40,000
Retreat!

987
01:30:40,002 --> 01:30:41,501
Retreat!

988
01:32:14,662 --> 01:32:17,597
Come on, you bastards!
Come on!

989
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:29,496
We've broken down the wall,
Captain,

990
01:34:29,498 --> 01:34:31,464
but we've lost many of our men.

991
01:34:31,466 --> 01:34:35,101
We have to win this.
We'll fight to the very end.

992
01:34:35,103 --> 01:34:36,970
[shouting]

993
01:34:36,972 --> 01:34:38,772
Another captain comes!

994
01:34:55,423 --> 01:34:57,323
My Lord, your brother is dead.

995
01:34:57,325 --> 01:35:00,427
We pledge ourselves to you
in your noble cause.

996
01:35:00,429 --> 01:35:03,430
Come, let us join the fight.

997
01:35:07,768 --> 01:35:09,502
- Sire.
- Speak, man.

998
01:35:09,504 --> 01:35:12,305
They've broken to the left.
They've reinforced.

999
01:35:12,307 --> 01:35:13,940
Let's ride.

1000
01:35:31,992 --> 01:35:33,326
Gregor!

1001
01:36:01,455 --> 01:36:03,957
- We're broken.
- Who will tell Thor?

1002
01:36:03,959 --> 01:36:05,558
To hell with him.

1003
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:08,962
I ride to my ships and beyond.
Stay if you wish.

1004
01:36:08,964 --> 01:36:11,431
- Save yourself if you can.
- You're not Vikings.

1005
01:36:11,433 --> 01:36:14,834
To hell with you, too,
King of Nordland.

1006
01:36:14,836 --> 01:36:16,469
Back to the fortress!

1007
01:36:16,471 --> 01:36:19,072
Retreat! Retreat!

1008
01:37:19,099 --> 01:37:21,868
- There's none left for us.
- Fine with me.

1009
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:26,940
I didn't come here
to be a casual observer.

1010
01:37:57,104 --> 01:37:59,172
I won't let you do it.

1011
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:08,548
So...

1012
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,183
what now, Eirick?

1013
01:38:10,185 --> 01:38:12,352
You cannot stop me.

1014
01:38:14,054 --> 01:38:16,956
Did you come just to see me
open the Gates of Helheim?

1015
01:38:16,958 --> 01:38:20,360
I may not have the horn,
but do you see me running?

1016
01:38:20,362 --> 01:38:24,964
I've come to face you, Thor,
and die if I must.

1017
01:38:24,966 --> 01:38:26,499
Ah, yes.

1018
01:38:27,601 --> 01:38:29,269
The horn.

1019
01:38:32,172 --> 01:38:34,274
By blowing this here,

1020
01:38:34,276 --> 01:38:36,643
you thought to send me
back to Valhalla.

1021
01:38:36,645 --> 01:38:38,578
I will try.

1022
01:38:39,713 --> 01:38:43,049
You cannot stand against me,
my son.

1023
01:38:43,051 --> 01:38:45,418
[thunderclap]

1024
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:50,290
Your father did not know
the truth.

1025
01:38:50,292 --> 01:38:54,260
He took after his form
to lay with your mother.

1026
01:38:54,262 --> 01:38:56,663
I did not need such artifices.

1027
01:38:56,665 --> 01:39:00,033
She was a willing whore
to my desires.

1028
01:39:01,302 --> 01:39:03,770
Did you truly believe

1029
01:39:03,772 --> 01:39:06,639
a mortal man could
rise from the dead,

1030
01:39:06,641 --> 01:39:09,509
could drink from a cup
of Frey without dying?

1031
01:39:09,511 --> 01:39:11,644
Could lay with
the Goddess of Love

1032
01:39:11,646 --> 01:39:14,480
without being driven insane
by desire?

1033
01:39:14,482 --> 01:39:17,717
The blood of the gods
is in your veins.

1034
01:39:17,719 --> 01:39:21,087
My blood is in your veins.

1035
01:39:22,222 --> 01:39:24,057
Yield to me

1036
01:39:24,059 --> 01:39:28,027
and together we shall rule
the world with our fist,

1037
01:39:28,029 --> 01:39:30,430
and we shall drive
the one god and his son

1038
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:32,398
from the face of the earth.

1039
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:35,802
I will not let you destroy
the middle kingdom.

1040
01:39:35,804 --> 01:39:37,236
Then fight.

1041
01:40:22,282 --> 01:40:23,383
[whips crack]

1042
01:42:14,595 --> 01:42:16,295
No! Eirick!

1043
01:43:01,608 --> 01:43:04,577
Your weapon
holds no fear for me!

1044
01:43:04,579 --> 01:43:06,913
I have the blood
of the gods in me.

1045
01:43:07,881 --> 01:43:09,949
I have the blood of the gods.

1046
01:43:32,906 --> 01:43:36,842
[horn blows]

1047
01:44:04,538 --> 01:44:06,872
May I have
the Horn of Helheim?

1048
01:44:09,977 --> 01:44:11,911
Lord Frey.

1049
01:44:16,617 --> 01:44:19,018
Poor Thane of Jomsberg.

1050
01:44:21,488 --> 01:44:26,058
You can blow this
until the sea freeze is over,

1051
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:29,328
but it was never meant
to blow Thor away.

1052
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:32,398
No, it was meant
for another...

1053
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,500
higher purpose.

1054
01:44:35,569 --> 01:44:37,770
- But you said--
- Yes.

1055
01:44:37,772 --> 01:44:42,808
I told you only an undead
could enter Hell.

1056
01:44:42,810 --> 01:44:44,644
Being gods,

1057
01:44:44,646 --> 01:44:49,548
both Thor and I needed you
to obtain this horn.

1058
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:51,350
You see,
three relics are needed

1059
01:44:51,352 --> 01:44:54,453
to open the gates of Heaven,
Earth and Hell.

1060
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:59,825
The necklace of Mary Magdalene
from Mittgard,

1061
01:44:59,827 --> 01:45:04,597
the Hammer of Thor
from Valhalla,

1062
01:45:04,599 --> 01:45:07,667
and the Gilded Horn
of Helheim.

1063
01:45:07,669 --> 01:45:09,535
You poor fool.

1064
01:45:09,537 --> 01:45:13,039
The horn is the final key,

1065
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:15,474
and you've brought it to us.

1066
01:45:16,510 --> 01:45:18,577
Why are you doing this?

1067
01:45:18,579 --> 01:45:21,947
Men... are ungrateful.

1068
01:45:21,949 --> 01:45:23,949
We have protected you for ages,

1069
01:45:23,951 --> 01:45:27,420
then you abandon us
for some new god?

1070
01:45:27,422 --> 01:45:31,590
It is time for man
to pay the price.

1071
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:39,865
My son...

1072
01:45:39,867 --> 01:45:42,635
together we could have
ruled the world.

1073
01:46:11,164 --> 01:46:17,670
[screaming]

1074
01:46:19,206 --> 01:46:20,806
FREY: The horn's breaking!

1075
01:46:20,808 --> 01:46:22,775
Something's wrong.

1076
01:46:34,087 --> 01:46:36,489
Why is this happening?

1077
01:46:37,858 --> 01:46:39,759
Because it's a fake!

1078
01:46:39,761 --> 01:46:43,529
I gave a false horn
to Beothric!

1079
01:46:43,531 --> 01:46:45,631
I listened to what
the earth told me!

1080
01:47:00,947 --> 01:47:03,682
ALCUIN: I knew your plans, Frey.

1081
01:47:03,684 --> 01:47:06,619
And I learned
you would betray us.

1082
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:16,195
Nature will always tell
the story of a traitor.

1083
01:47:16,197 --> 01:47:17,663
No one--

1084
01:47:17,665 --> 01:47:19,932
god or mortal--

1085
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:21,867
should rule the earth!

1086

1087

1089
01:48:07,047 --> 01:48:08,747
Brynna.

1090
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,321
It's a good death.

1091
01:48:15,323 --> 01:48:18,324
It should've been me.

1092
01:48:18,326 --> 01:48:21,594
No one chooses their fate.

1093
01:48:25,232 --> 01:48:29,602
You're not responsible
for my life

1094
01:48:29,604 --> 01:48:32,004
or anyone else's.

1095
01:48:32,006 --> 01:48:33,939
Only your own.

1096
01:48:36,109 --> 01:48:37,743
[groans]

1097
01:48:38,778 --> 01:48:39,912
I'm at peace.

1098
01:48:43,116 --> 01:48:46,051
I have a glorious death.

1099
01:48:49,155 --> 01:48:51,824
Send me back to sea.

1100
01:49:26,860 --> 01:49:28,160
Behold, Brynna the Fair.

1101
01:49:28,162 --> 01:49:31,297
You see your mother
awaiting you in paradise?

1102
01:49:31,299 --> 01:49:33,399
Behold, Gregor the Formidable.

1103
01:49:33,401 --> 01:49:35,301
Do you see our kinsmen?

1104
01:49:35,303 --> 01:49:37,269
Behold, Warick the Wise.

1105
01:49:37,271 --> 01:49:39,405
Do you see your rest
awaiting you in paradise?

1106
01:49:39,407 --> 01:49:41,774
Behold, Bernard the Viking.

1107
01:49:41,776 --> 01:49:45,244
His paradise is his honor
and family.

1108
01:49:49,182 --> 01:49:50,416
And there I see my friends

1109
01:49:50,418 --> 01:49:52,885
surrounded by those
who have gone before.

1110
01:49:52,887 --> 01:49:58,057
For when my time comes,
I shall join them there gladly.

ERICK: <i>Such marks the passing</i>
