1
00:00:58,021 --> 00:00:59,985
HEH HEH.

2
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:02,980
WELL, I GUESS I CAN
TELL THE STORY

3
00:01:03,004 --> 00:01:04,985
AS WELL AS ANYONE.

4
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:08,978
YES. YOU SEE, IT WAS
A LONG, LONG TIME AGO,

5
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:09,994
BUT, OH...

6
00:01:10,018 --> 00:01:11,995
IT FEELS LIKE YESTERDAY.

7
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:14,023
YOU SEE, THERE WAS A KING...

8
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:15,993
A GOOD KING, MIND YOU...

9
00:01:16,017 --> 00:01:19,982
WHO RULED OVER A KINGDOM
BY THE SEA.

10
00:01:20,006 --> 00:01:20,995
THE KING WAS HAPPY THERE,

11
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:21,989
AS WERE HIS PEOPLE...

12
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:25,988
NO DESIRE TO VISIT FARAWAY LANDS

13
00:01:26,012 --> 00:01:27,997
AND TRAVEL THE WORLD.

14
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,985
AH, BUT PRINCESS SERENA,

15
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,999
THE KING'S ONLY DAUGHTER,

16
00:01:34,023 --> 00:01:35,994
WELL...

17
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:39,019
SHE WAS ANOTHER MATTER.

18
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,985
UHH.

19
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:02,019
WHAT WAS THAT?

20
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:19,992
SIR...

21
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:20,993
SIR...

22
00:02:21,017 --> 00:02:22,981
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

23
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,994
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

24
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:28,006
OHH.

25
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,986
OHH. MY CASE. WHAT?

26
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,023
MY CASE.

27
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:42,992
BE CAREFUL WITH THAT. YOU...

28
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:44,023
OHH.

29
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:53,016
THANK YOU.

30
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,992
IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE?
IS THAT A BOOK?

31
00:02:58,016 --> 00:03:01,009
OHH! WHAT ARE THESE?

32
00:03:02,008 --> 00:03:03,990
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOU?

33
00:03:04,014 --> 00:03:04,981
UHH.

34
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:06,994
HOW... HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

35
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:09,985
SOME THINGS ARE BEYOND
THE UNDERSTANDING

36
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:11,020
OF A MERE...

37
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:14,997
GIRL?

38
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:16,978
CHILD.

39
00:03:17,002 --> 00:03:18,990
I'M OLD ENOUGH TO BE QUEEN.

40
00:03:19,014 --> 00:03:21,017
REALLY?

41
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:26,992
YOU CAN STAY
AS LONG AS YOU WANT,

42
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:27,996
BUT AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE,

43
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,978
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE TO TELL ME

44
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:30,997
ALL ABOUT WHERE YOU'VE COME FROM

45
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,995
AND HOW YOU MAKE
YOUR MEDICINES AND...

46
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:34,023
YOU'RE AWFULLY...

47
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:34,997
INQUISITIVE.

48
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:37,995
HMM. EVERYBODY SAYS
I'M TOO CURIOUS

49
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:38,997
FOR MY OWN GOOD.

50
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:41,991
I NEED TO DRY YOU OFF
AND GET YOU SOMETHING TO EAT.

51
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:43,981
DO YOU LIKE SEAFOOD?

52
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:45,981
I AM SEAFOOD.

53
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:46,987
EXCUSE ME?

54
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:47,988
NEVER MIND.

55
00:03:48,012 --> 00:03:50,993
ARE YOU ALWAYS
SO KIND TO STRANGERS?

56
00:03:51,017 --> 00:03:52,991
FATHER ALWAYS SAYS
THAT SUSPICION

57
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:54,995
MIGHT SAVE YOU ONE GOLD COIN.

58
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,986
TRUST WILL EARN YOU 2.

59
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,996
YOUR FATHER SOUNDS LIKE
A VERY WISE MAN.

60
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,019
I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET HIM.

61
00:04:07,015 --> 00:04:07,995
FATHER!

62
00:04:08,019 --> 00:04:10,019
FATHER!

63
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:15,981
I WAS OUT AT THE POINT.
HE WAS WASHED UP.

64
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:16,978
HE'S A PRINCE

65
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:17,995
FROM A PLACE WHERE
THEY'VE LEARNED TO...

66
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:18,994
CALM DOWN, SERENA,

67
00:04:19,018 --> 00:04:21,023
BEFORE YOU SCARE
YOUR NEWFOUND FRIEND AWAY.

68
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,980
HE WAS NEARLY DEAD
WHEN I FOUND HIM,

69
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:25,987
AND NOW... WELL, LOOK AT HIM.

70
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:27,996
YOUR MAJESTY.

71
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,999
SHOW HIM WHAT YOU CAN DO
WITH YOUR POTIONS.

72
00:04:30,023 --> 00:04:32,978
SHOW HIM HOW
YOU BROUGHT YOURSELF

73
00:04:33,002 --> 00:04:32,995
BACK TO LIFE.

74
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:33,997
FATHER, HE WAS NEARLY DEAD.

75
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:35,997
SERENA, PLEASE
LET THE MAN SPEAK.

76
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:37,997
MY CREATIONS ARE NOT SOMETHING

77
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:41,010
I ORDINARILY SHARE...

78
00:04:43,005 --> 00:04:45,014
WITH ANYONE.

79
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:00,995
BUT SINCE YOUR DAUGHTER
DID SAVE MY LIFE,

80
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:02,023
I WILL MAKE AN EXCEPTION.

81
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:05,991
ALL MY POTIONS
ARE DERIVED FROM SEA WATER,

82
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:08,022
THE SOURCE OF ALL LIFE.

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,981
THIS, FOR EXAMPLE,

84
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:12,989
ENABLES A PERSON
TO SEE MORE CLEARLY.

85
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,986
THIS IMPROVES MEMORY,

86
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,996
AND THIS EXTENDS LIFE.

87
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,981
I THINK YOU SHOULD
TAKE THE ONE FOR MEMORY,

88
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:21,991
SO YOU CAN REMEMBER MY BIRTHDAY.

89
00:05:22,015 --> 00:05:22,994
THIS ONE...

90
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:24,994
OFFERS LONG LIFE?

91
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:26,995
I RECOMMEND...

92
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:28,991
2 DRAMS, TWICE A DAY.

93
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:30,999
I WON'T EVEN TELL YOU
HOW OLD I AM.

94
00:05:31,023 --> 00:05:33,998
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

95
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:35,984
WHAT SOME CALL IMPOSSIBLE

96
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:38,023
IS ONLY THAT WHICH
HASN'T BEEN IMAGINED.

97
00:05:39,001 --> 00:05:40,023
ANY SIDE EFFECTS?

98
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:41,994
QUICKER WIT,

99
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:43,987
MILD EUPHORIA...

100
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:48,003
TO LIFE IN ALL ITS FORMS.

101
00:05:49,007 --> 00:05:49,997
YOUR MAJESTY,

102
00:05:50,021 --> 00:05:51,994
IF THE PROSPECT OF LONG LIFE

103
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,005
IS DAUNTING TO YOU...

104
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,014
TO A LONG AND HAPPY REIGN.

105
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:07,992
OHH! TASTES...

106
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:10,022
AWFUL, ISN'T IT?

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,993
IT'S MADE OF SLIME

108
00:06:12,017 --> 00:06:14,990
SCRAPED FROM STONES
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.

109
00:06:15,014 --> 00:06:16,993
HOW ON EARTH DID YOU MANAGE

110
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:19,986
TO GET SOMETHING FROM THE...

111
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,017
AHH!

112
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:23,986
FATHER?

113
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:31,018
OHH!

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,014
UHH!

115
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:49,996
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

116
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,013
STOP THAT!

117
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:53,983
I COMMAND YOU!

118
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:56,020
GUARDS! GUARDS!

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,016
OHH!

120
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:11,023
OHH!

121
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,999
ARREST THIS MAN!

122
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:18,988
ARREST?

123
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:20,986
THE KING?

124
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,986
MY DAUGHTER IS CONFUSED.

125
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,330
HE STOLE
MY FATHER'S BODY!

126
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:26,980
THIS WIZARD CAST A SPELL ON HER

127
00:07:27,004 --> 00:07:26,998
AND TRIED TO POISON ME.

128
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:28,995
HE'S THE ONE WHO CAST THE SPELL,

129
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:29,997
NOT... NOT HIM!

130
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,989
I SAW THE WHOLE THING.

131
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:32,988
TAKE HER TO HER ROOM

132
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:35,991
AND KEEP HER THERE
UNTIL THE SPELL WEARS OFF.

133
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:36,986
HOW DARE YOU!

134
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,994
THROW HIM
INTO OUR DEEPEST DUNGEON

135
00:07:39,018 --> 00:07:41,987
UNTIL I DECIDE
HOW HE SHOULD DIE.

136
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:42,989
NO!

137
00:07:43,013 --> 00:07:43,993
BUT...

138
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:44,996
SIRE...

139
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,007
DO IT!

140
00:07:49,014 --> 00:07:50,986
TALK TO THEM, FATHER!

141
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:51,996
FATHER!

142
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,981
BRING HIM BACK!

143
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:54,998
I WANT MY FATHER BACK!

144
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:56,990
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HIM?

145
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:58,995
DARLING, PLEASE CALM YOURSELF.

146
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:01,019
FATHER!

147
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:03,983
LOOK. IN THIS BOOK...

148
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:06,980
HIS POTIONS
AND HOW HE MAKES THEM.

149
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:07,990
DARLING, PLEASE.

150
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:09,982
HE LIED TO US.

151
00:08:10,006 --> 00:08:10,982
LISTEN TO HIM.

152
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:12,984
SWEETHEART, YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

153
00:08:13,008 --> 00:08:14,997
IS THAT MY FATHER'S VOICE?

154
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:16,999
IS IT?

155
00:08:17,023 --> 00:08:18,982
FATHER!

156
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:19,993
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?

157
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:22,019
WHY, YOU...

158
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:27,000
CONFUSED LITTLE GIRL.

159
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:30,017
STOP HER!

160
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:47,984
IF WE DON'T FIND
MY DAUGHTER SOON,

161
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:50,993
SHE MAY HARM HERSELF.

162
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:51,992
WHEN YOU FIND HER,

163
00:08:52,016 --> 00:08:54,978
PAY NO ATTENTION TO HER RAVINGS.

164
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,015
JUST BRING HER BACK.

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,988
SEE HER?

166
00:09:07,012 --> 00:09:08,019
HUH.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,200
THINK YOU'RE THE KING, DO YOU?

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,992
WELL, RULE THIS, YOUR MAJESTY.

169
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:29,996
OHH.

170
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,013
OHH.

171
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:36,994
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT?

172
00:09:37,018 --> 00:09:41,015
HE'LL GET THE DROP FOR SURE.

173
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:01,006
SERENA?

174
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:09,005
SERENA.

175
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,022
PLEASE...

176
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:14,992
COME CLOSER.

177
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:17,979
HOW CAN... HOW CAN I BE SURE...

178
00:10:18,003 --> 00:10:18,997
SURELY...

179
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:21,983
YOU KNOW YOUR OWN FATHER...

180
00:10:22,007 --> 00:10:23,988
NO MATTER HOW I LOOK.

181
00:10:24,012 --> 00:10:25,996
SERENA, YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED.

182
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,989
I'M NOT SURE WHAT I SAW.

183
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:30,996
I'M NOT SURE
OF ANYTHING ANYMORE.

184
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,998
MORNING GLORIES ARE
YOUR FAVORITE FLOWER.

185
00:10:35,022 --> 00:10:36,997
PURPLE IS YOUR FAVORITE COLOR.

186
00:10:37,021 --> 00:10:38,983
YOU LOVE PEACHES.

187
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:40,989
YOUR FAVORITE HOLIDAY IS...

188
00:10:41,013 --> 00:10:41,998
WELL, IT USED TO BE...

189
00:10:42,022 --> 00:10:43,998
OH, FATHER.

190
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:48,986
YOU MUST GO.

191
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:49,997
IF HE FINDS YOU HERE...

192
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:52,988
I HAVE THE PAGE FROM HIS BOOK.

193
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:54,988
I THINK I KNOW
WHERE TO FIND THE POTION

194
00:10:55,012 --> 00:10:55,997
TO UNDO THE SPELL.

195
00:10:56,021 --> 00:11:00,008
WHEN I GET IT, I'LL COME BACK.

196
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:02,994
I LOVE YOU.

197
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:06,015
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

198
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:10,007
HURRY.

199
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:40,007
AFTER HER!

200
00:13:06,022 --> 00:13:07,990
YOU MEN, THAT WAY!

201
00:13:08,014 --> 00:13:09,985
YOU, OVER THERE!

202
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:12,010
FOLLOW ME!

203
00:13:24,017 --> 00:13:26,023
WATCH IT!

204
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:41,008
YOU, THAT WAY! GO!

205
00:13:41,816 --> 00:13:42,992
CAN'T HAVE GONE FAR.

206
00:13:43,016 --> 00:13:47,007
ALL RIGHT, CHECK THIS WAY.

207
00:13:48,015 --> 00:13:49,994
THIS WAY.

208
00:13:50,018 --> 00:13:51,997
OVER HERE.

209
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:53,023
ANYTHING?

210
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:56,008
NOT YET.

211
00:13:57,006 --> 00:13:59,019
CHECK THAT CORRIDOR.

212
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:09,012
WELL, SHE CAN'T HAVE
JUST DISAPPEARED.

213
00:14:11,003 --> 00:14:13,005
GUARD!

214
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,994
LET US CIRCLE AROUND.

215
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:23,015
ALL RIGHT.

216
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,995
WE'VE LOOKED
EVERYWHERE, SIR.

217
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,021
I'LL GO BACK AROUND.

218
00:14:45,016 --> 00:14:48,003
NOTHING HERE, SIR.

219
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:06,022
LET'S SEE.

220
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,014
UH...

221
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:12,008
AHA.

222
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:16,022
HMM.

223
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,008
I SUPPOSE THIS WILL HAVE TO DO.

224
00:16:42,004 --> 00:16:42,980
EXCUSE ME, SIR,

225
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:45,980
BUT WOULD YOU MIND IF
I BORROWED YOUR CLOAK?

226
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,021
I'LL BUY IT FROM YOU.

227
00:17:35,021 --> 00:17:37,984
THE SHIP I SAW
THIS AFTERNOON.

228
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:39,018
I WONDER.

229
00:18:08,002 --> 00:18:12,018
NO MORE DRINKS
FOR THAT TABLE.

230
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:18,009
A TOAST... TO CALICO JACK.

231
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:29,017
HEY,
I WASN'T DONE WITH THAT.

232
00:18:32,015 --> 00:18:35,011
WELCOME TO CALICO JACK'S.

233
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:37,995
WE WILL WELCOME YOU.

234
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:39,998
COME IN, LITTLE GIRL.

235
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:41,986
I WANT TO HIRE THAT SHIP.

236
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,984
WELL, THAT SHIP
BELONGS TO SINBAD.

237
00:18:45,008 --> 00:18:45,995
WHERE CAN I FIND HIM?

238
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:48,998
WELL, SINBAD
DON'T WORK FOR HIRE...

239
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:50,986
ONLY WORKS FOR HIMSELF.

240
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:53,984
WHICH OF YOU IS SINBAD?

241
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:54,996
OH, SINBAD.

242
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,983
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE SINBAD IS?

243
00:18:59,007 --> 00:18:59,992
I AM.

244
00:19:01,021 --> 00:19:02,980
I AM SINBAD.

245
00:19:03,004 --> 00:19:03,990
OH, YOU ARE NOT.

246
00:19:04,014 --> 00:19:06,988
WE ARE SINBAD.

247
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:07,996
ME, TOO!

248
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:10,023
I AM.

249
00:19:13,014 --> 00:19:14,999
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE SINBAD, TOO.

250
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:18,985
IT DEPENDS WHO'S ASKING.

251
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:21,022
THE DAUGHTER OF KING CHANDRA.

252
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,022
RIGHT. A PRINCESS.

253
00:19:31,008 --> 00:19:31,979
UHH.

254
00:19:32,003 --> 00:19:33,994
I'LL TAKE YOU FOR A SAIL, MISSY.

255
00:19:34,018 --> 00:19:35,981
HOW DARE YOU! UNHAND ME!

256
00:19:36,005 --> 00:19:36,994
THAT'S ENOUGH.

257
00:19:37,018 --> 00:19:39,996
LET HER GO.

258
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,982
WHY?

259
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:44,008
UH-OH.

260
00:19:46,021 --> 00:19:46,998
WELL, FOR STARTERS,

261
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:50,020
YOU'RE DRUNK, AND SHE'S...

262
00:19:55,017 --> 00:19:57,018
CONFUSED.

263
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:03,000
UHH. OHH.

264
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:12,994
IT'S A LEFT, A RIGHT,

265
00:20:13,018 --> 00:20:14,990
AND THEN A LEFT, A RIGHT.

266
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,987
OH, THEY GET THIS WAY EVERY TIME

267
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:20,018
THEY COME IN FROM A VOYAGE. HA!

268
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:28,023
LOOK AT THEM... LIKE BROTHERS.

269
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:29,987
GET UP, SINBAD.

270
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:32,987
GET UP. OH, HE'S
COMING UP THE STAIRS.

271
00:20:33,011 --> 00:20:34,980
OH, NICE. NICE ONE.

272
00:20:35,004 --> 00:20:35,996
OH, AND HE'S...

273
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,019
OUT OF THE WINDOW
IN UNDER 2 MINUTES.

274
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:41,022
HA HA HA!

275
00:20:46,001 --> 00:20:48,004
A NEW RECORD.

276
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:53,013
OH, SINBAD,
SINBAD, SINBAD.

277
00:20:55,007 --> 00:20:56,998
SORRY ABOUT THE WINDOW, JACK.

278
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:57,996
AHEM.

279
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,984
NEEDED CLEANING ANYWAY.

280
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:02,994
HERE...

281
00:21:03,018 --> 00:21:05,992
FOR DAMAGES AND DRINKS.

282
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:06,995
THIS IS TOO MUCH.

283
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:10,998
I OWE YOU MORE
THAN I CAN EVER PAY.

284
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:14,989
OH, COME HERE,
YOU SENTIMENTAL IDIOT.

285
00:21:15,013 --> 00:21:15,997
NOW GET OUT OF HERE.

286
00:21:16,021 --> 00:21:18,020
GO ON.

287
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,998
THE PRINCESS HAS JUST BEEN...

288
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:34,014
SPOTTED IN THE VICINITY
OF CALICO JACK'S.

289
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,996
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

290
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,009
GO!

291
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:41,997
HELLO.

292
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:43,987
EXCUSE ME.

293
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,991
YOU'RE SINBAD, AREN'T YOU?

294
00:21:46,015 --> 00:21:47,990
WHAT GAVE YOU THAT IDEA?

295
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:48,998
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE IN THERE

296
00:21:49,022 --> 00:21:50,996
WHO DIDN'T CLAIM TO BE.

297
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:52,998
I REALLY DO NEED YOUR HELP.

298
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:54,985
YOU JUST GOT MY HELP.

299
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:55,998
MY FATHER'S IN JAIL.

300
00:21:56,022 --> 00:21:57,991
GET YOURSELF A LAWYER.

301
00:21:58,015 --> 00:21:59,987
HE'S BEEN CONDEMNED TO DEATH.

302
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:00,986
GET A GOOD LAWYER.

303
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,987
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

304
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:04,997
THAT YOU NEED HELP?

305
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:05,994
HA. NO OFFENSE,

306
00:22:06,018 --> 00:22:07,997
BUT ANYBODY WHO THINKS
SHE'S A PRINCESS

307
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:09,986
NEEDS A LOT OF HELP.

308
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,982
I DON'T <i>THINK</i> I'M A PRINCESS.

309
00:22:12,006 --> 00:22:16,002
I <i>AM</i><i>A PRINCESS.</i>

310
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:23,995
I CAN PAY.

311
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:24,998
HOW MUCH?

312
00:22:25,022 --> 00:22:25,996
WELL...

313
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,989
I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH
THESE THINGS COST,

314
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:28,997
BUT HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT?

315
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:31,990
EH, I'M SORRY. I DON'T DO
DAMSEL IN DISTRESS.

316
00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:32,987
REALLY?

317
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:35,017
NAME A PRICE.

318
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:36,993
YOUR WEIGHT IN GOLD.

319
00:22:37,017 --> 00:22:37,996
DONE...

320
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,005
AS SOON AS WE'RE THROUGH.

321
00:22:42,003 --> 00:22:44,018
WAIT!

322
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:46,981
COWARD!

323
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:46,999
HA HA HA!

324
00:22:47,023 --> 00:22:49,996
I'VE BEEN CALLED
WORSE BY BETTER.

325
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,995
GOOD LUCK GETTING
WHEREVER YOU'RE GOING.

326
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:53,996
GOING TO THE EDGE OF
THE EARTH IF I HAVE TO!

327
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,997
I DON'T KNOW WHAT BOOKS
YOU'VE BEEN READING, SISTER,

328
00:22:57,021 --> 00:22:58,997
BUT THE WORLD'S NOT FLAT.

329
00:22:59,021 --> 00:23:00,983
HASN'T BEEN FOR YEARS.

330
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:01,997
BUT IF YOU WOULD LISTEN
TO ME, YOU WOULD...

331
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:02,999
TRUST ME ON THIS ONE.

332
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:07,987
DO YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT?

333
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:10,994
I NEED TO GO BEYOND
THE VEIL OF MISTS.

334
00:23:11,018 --> 00:23:13,990
IT SAYS SO RIGHT HERE.

335
00:23:14,014 --> 00:23:15,985
THE VEIL OF MISTS?

336
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:17,983
THE VEIL OF MISTS IS A...

337
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:18,995
IT'S A MYTH. IT'S MAKE-BELIEVE.

338
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:20,988
IT DOESN'T EXIST.

339
00:23:21,012 --> 00:23:21,982
WAIT.

340
00:23:22,006 --> 00:23:23,991
PLEASE, COME BACK.

341
00:23:24,015 --> 00:23:25,995
SINBAD!

342
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:27,994
I COMMAND YOU!

343
00:23:28,018 --> 00:23:29,994
DO THAT AGAIN.

344
00:23:30,018 --> 00:23:30,991
ONLY THIS TIME,

345
00:23:31,015 --> 00:23:33,986
STICK YOUR LIP OUT
AND STOMP YOUR FOOT.

346
00:23:37,014 --> 00:23:38,989
YOU CAN HAVE IT ALL.

347
00:23:39,013 --> 00:23:40,980
I DON'T CARE.

348
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:44,002
I JUST WANT MY FATHER BACK.

349
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,990
SO, SINBAD...

350
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:53,990
YES?

351
00:23:54,014 --> 00:23:56,023
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SHUT UP.

352
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:12,002
GET IN.

353
00:24:34,023 --> 00:24:37,992
AH, THERE HE GOES AGAIN.

354
00:24:38,016 --> 00:24:38,995
HA HA HA!

355
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,008
SENTIMENTAL IDIOT.

356
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:55,981
WHERE IS SHE?

357
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:58,023
LOOKING FOR YOUR WIFE AGAIN?

358
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:00,983
UHH!

359
00:25:01,007 --> 00:25:02,979
IF YOU THINK I'M TELLING
THE LIKES OF YOU

360
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:05,023
ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING...

361
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:19,022
I'LL BE BACK, FATHER.

362
00:25:25,019 --> 00:25:25,990
UHH!

363
00:25:26,014 --> 00:25:29,023
A POX, A PLAGUE,
AND A PANDEMONIUM

364
00:25:30,001 --> 00:25:30,997
ON THE LOT OF YOU...

365
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:32,995
ESPECIALLY YOU!

366
00:25:33,019 --> 00:25:33,990
I NEED TO KNOW

367
00:25:34,014 --> 00:25:37,997
WHERE SINBAD
IS TAKING MY DAUGHTER.

368
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:40,997
THE KING ASKED YOU A QUESTION.

369
00:25:41,021 --> 00:25:43,982
HUH. THAT'S FUNNY.

370
00:25:44,006 --> 00:25:45,991
THE WAY SHE TELLS IT,
THE KING'S ALL LOCKED UP

371
00:25:46,015 --> 00:25:47,991
AND BEING FITTED
FOR THE HANGMAN.

372
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:50,996
HOW DARE YOU
SPEAK TO ME THAT WAY,

373
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,998
YOU IMPERTINENT

374
00:25:54,022 --> 00:25:55,987
BARKEEP!

375
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:57,993
PFFT!

376
00:25:58,017 --> 00:26:00,017
TAKE HIM AWAY!

377
00:26:01,008 --> 00:26:01,984
HEKYLL, JEKYLL,

378
00:26:02,008 --> 00:26:03,978
GIVE ME A LIFT. UP WE GO.

379
00:26:04,002 --> 00:26:04,984
OOH! EASY.

380
00:26:05,008 --> 00:26:06,017
HA HA HA!

381
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:14,983
UHH!

382
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:18,997
YOU AIN'T HEARD THE LAST
OF CALICO JACK,

383
00:26:19,021 --> 00:26:19,995
YOU HEATHENS!

384
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,011
WHO'S THERE?

385
00:26:27,022 --> 00:26:30,991
WHO'S THERE? IDENTIFY YOURSELF.

386
00:26:31,015 --> 00:26:31,999
COME, STRANGER.

387
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:33,984
THAT VOICE.

388
00:26:34,008 --> 00:26:34,994
WELCOME TO MY CELL.

389
00:26:35,018 --> 00:26:37,022
OH, SIRE.

390
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:40,999
THOSE SAVAGES
HAVE GOT YOU CHAINED.

391
00:26:41,023 --> 00:26:43,981
OH, YOUR LITTLE GIRL WAS RIGHT.

392
00:26:44,005 --> 00:26:44,994
YOU'VE SEEN HER?

393
00:26:45,018 --> 00:26:45,994
AYE, THAT I HAVE.

394
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:48,993
SHE CAME MY WAY LOOKING
FOR HELP AND FOUND IT.

395
00:26:49,017 --> 00:26:49,996
SHE'S GONE TO SEA.

396
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,998
IS SHE SAFE?

397
00:26:51,022 --> 00:26:52,981
WELL, IF SHE'S STILL
WITH SINBAD,

398
00:26:53,005 --> 00:26:56,019
THEN, YES, YES, SHE'S VERY SAFE.

399
00:27:05,003 --> 00:27:06,163
I MAKE THE BEST SALTFISH

400
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,022
THIS SIDE OF THE BAY.

401
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,987
DO I GET ANY CREDIT?

402
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:11,997
NO. I JUST... OOH! OHH! OOH!

403
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:13,996
WHAT AM I, INVISIBLE?

404
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,999
HMM.

405
00:27:15,023 --> 00:27:16,023
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

406
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,017
HUH. WOMEN.

407
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,981
GOOD MORNING.

408
00:27:30,005 --> 00:27:31,998
GOOD AFTERNOON.

409
00:27:32,022 --> 00:27:33,991
WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE WAKE ME?

410
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:38,023
UM, WE WERE BUSY SAILING A SHIP.

411
00:27:39,021 --> 00:27:40,997
UH, ABOUT MY CLOTHES...

412
00:27:41,021 --> 00:27:41,989
YES?

413
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:43,984
I WOULD'VE PREFERRED CLEAN.

414
00:27:44,008 --> 00:27:44,998
CLEAN'S JUST A SCRUB AWAY.

415
00:27:45,022 --> 00:27:49,020
FEEL FREE TO USE
THE WASHTUBS ANYTIME.

416
00:27:52,022 --> 00:27:53,989
IS IT TOO LATE FOR BREAKFAST?

417
00:27:54,013 --> 00:27:55,999
"IS IT TOO LATE FOR BREAKFAST?"

418
00:27:56,023 --> 00:27:57,023
MOOK!

419
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,989
WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE
IS FRESH CREAM AND PEACHES.

420
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,996
OOH, SO WOULD I.

421
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,982
WHAT DO WE HAVE ON
THE MENU TODAY, MOOK?

422
00:28:05,006 --> 00:28:06,999
WE HAVE SALTFISH,
BISCUIT, AND PEAS,

423
00:28:07,023 --> 00:28:09,998
OR WE HAVE BISCUIT,
PEAS, AND SALTFISH.

424
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:12,994
I THINK I'LL WAIT FOR DINNER.

425
00:28:14,014 --> 00:28:14,999
OH, SALTFISH
IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR US,

426
00:28:15,023 --> 00:28:16,992
BUT NOT FOR HER MAJESTY?

427
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:19,994
MOOK'S CONVINCED SALTFISH
HAS STUNTED HIS GROWTH.

428
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:21,979
MOCK ALL YOU WANT,

429
00:28:22,003 --> 00:28:22,994
BUT I AM STILL TWICE THE MAN

430
00:28:23,018 --> 00:28:24,986
OF MEN HALF MY SIZE.

431
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:27,004
HMM?

432
00:28:29,004 --> 00:28:30,980
WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP?

433
00:28:31,004 --> 00:28:32,999
I THINK WE'VE PRETTY MUCH
GOT THIS UNDER CONTROL.

434
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:35,998
I INSIST. I'VE SPENT
MY ENTIRE LIFE

435
00:28:36,022 --> 00:28:38,997
IN A SEASIDE KINGDOM.

436
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:44,013
A REGULAR SISTER
OF THE SALTY SEAS, HUH?

437
00:28:59,002 --> 00:29:00,016
WAIT!

438
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:06,016
OK.

439
00:29:08,021 --> 00:29:09,990
HERE.

440
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,990
HOLD THIS. HOLD IT TIGHT.

441
00:29:12,014 --> 00:29:13,983
TIGHTER.

442
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,994
LET HER HIGHER INTO THE WIND!

443
00:29:16,018 --> 00:29:18,996
MUSTAFA, READY THE MAIN!

444
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,020
MOVE IT, YOU MISERABLE SLUGS!

445
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:24,998
LASH THAT LINE!

446
00:29:25,022 --> 00:29:26,023
AYE, AYE.

447
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,991
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING I CAN DO

448
00:29:35,015 --> 00:29:35,986
TO REALLY HELP.

449
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:43,997
HERE. I'LL DO IT.

450
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:44,994
WHOA!

451
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:46,989
OOPS.

452
00:29:47,013 --> 00:29:47,996
WHOA!

453
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,979
PULL ME IN! PULL ME IN!

454
00:29:50,003 --> 00:29:50,999
COME ON! GRAB THE LINE!

455
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:52,993
AY!

456
00:29:53,017 --> 00:29:55,984
AAH!

457
00:29:56,008 --> 00:29:59,023
SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW!

458
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:03,012
HERE YOU GO, LITTLE GUY.

459
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,982
WHY DOES HE GET
TO HAVE ALL THE FUN?

460
00:30:08,022 --> 00:30:10,984
LASH THAT LINE!

461
00:30:11,008 --> 00:30:11,997
NOW!

462
00:30:12,021 --> 00:30:13,996
OH, GREAT, NOW IT'LL BE...

463
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,978
"MOOK, CLEAN THIS."
"MOOK, SWEEP THAT."

464
00:30:17,002 --> 00:30:18,978
"MOOK, THIS PLATE IS CHIPPED."

465
00:30:19,002 --> 00:30:18,995
MOOK, MOOK, MOOK, MOOK.

466
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:21,022
HOLD ON! I'VE GOT YOU.

467
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,998
HELP!

468
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:25,984
DON'T WORRY,
BROTHER. I'VE GOT YOU.

469
00:30:26,008 --> 00:30:26,992
YOU KNOW I CAN'T SWIM!

470
00:30:36,007 --> 00:30:36,979
I TOLD YOU.

471
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:38,992
WHO RELEASED
THE JIB LINE?

472
00:30:39,016 --> 00:30:43,014
I'LL GIVE YOU 2 GUESSES.

473
00:30:52,004 --> 00:30:52,983
I'M JUST WONDERING...
WHAT IN THE WORLD

474
00:30:53,007 --> 00:30:54,978
IS GOING ON IN THAT
ROYAL MIND OF YOURS?

475
00:30:55,002 --> 00:30:55,994
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP.

476
00:30:56,018 --> 00:30:56,995
NEXT TIME YOU FEEL THE NEED,

477
00:30:57,019 --> 00:31:00,022
TAKE A DEEP BREATH,
AND IT'LL PASS.

478
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,995
YOU CAN'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.

479
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:04,979
ON MY SHIP,
I TALK THE WAY I PLEASE.

480
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:05,995
NOT WHEN I'M PAYING THE BILL.

481
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:07,996
THAT'S ASSUMING WE MAKE IT BACK

482
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,995
IN ONE PIECE,

483
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:10,990
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SIT DOWN OVER THERE

484
00:31:11,014 --> 00:31:12,992
AND BE A PRINCESS, PRINCESS?

485
00:31:13,016 --> 00:31:17,988
IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO TURN BACK.

486
00:31:18,012 --> 00:31:20,023
YOU WOULDN'T DARE.

487
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:22,021
OH?

488
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:24,987
PREPARE TO COME ABOUT!

489
00:31:25,011 --> 00:31:26,981
PREPARE TO COME ABOUT!

490
00:31:27,005 --> 00:31:28,995
PREPARE TO COME ABOUT!

491
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:30,219
PREPARE TO COME ABOUT!

492
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,996
PREPARE TO COME ABOUT!

493
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,996
PREPARE TO COME ABOUT!

494
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,996
YOUR CALL.

495
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,990
UH... UH, I...

496
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:43,995
TERRIFIC.

497
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:44,994
THERE'S NOT ENOUGH
SALT IN THE SEA.

498
00:31:45,018 --> 00:31:48,011
NOW YOU'VE GOT TO ADD YOURS?

499
00:31:49,015 --> 00:31:50,979
ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S IT GOING TO BE?

500
00:31:51,003 --> 00:31:53,017
WE COMING ABOUT OR NOT?

501
00:31:54,008 --> 00:31:54,981
FULL AHEAD!

502
00:31:55,005 --> 00:31:56,997
I DON'T THINK HE LIKES HER.

503
00:31:57,021 --> 00:31:58,996
WORSE THAN THAT.

504
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,992
REALLY? POOR GUY.

505
00:32:01,016 --> 00:32:02,995
BARAKA GAVE ME 3 CHOICES...

506
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:05,996
VISION, MEMORY, OR LONG LIFE.

507
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,982
AND YOU PICKED?

508
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:08,987
LONG LIFE.

509
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,998
AW, SHOULD'VE GONE
WITH THE VISION THING.

510
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:12,998
YOU MIGHT'VE SEEN THIS COMING.

511
00:32:13,022 --> 00:32:13,999
WHAT HAPPENED THEN?

512
00:32:14,023 --> 00:32:16,997
I CAN'T QUITE REMEMBER.

513
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:17,994
AHH.

514
00:32:18,018 --> 00:32:19,996
IT'S ALWAYS HARDEST
RIGHT AFTER THEY GO,

515
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:20,994
ISN'T IT?

516
00:32:21,018 --> 00:32:24,992
OH, I LOVE THAT BOY
LIKE HE WAS ME OWN SON.

517
00:32:25,016 --> 00:32:25,998
HOW I DO MISS HIM.

518
00:32:26,022 --> 00:32:28,984
WHERE ARE HIS REAL PARENTS?

519
00:32:29,008 --> 00:32:29,994
LOST AT SEA

520
00:32:30,018 --> 00:32:33,019
A LONG, LONG TIME AGO.

521
00:32:45,003 --> 00:32:45,978
NO ONE REALLY KNOWS

522
00:32:46,002 --> 00:32:48,989
THE LAST TIME THIS WAS USED.

523
00:32:49,013 --> 00:32:49,998
GET THIS WORKING.

524
00:32:50,022 --> 00:32:52,020
YES, SIRE.

525
00:32:53,016 --> 00:32:57,001
THE PEOPLE EXPECT SWIFT JUSTICE.

526
00:33:04,008 --> 00:33:06,981
AHEM. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

527
00:33:07,005 --> 00:33:07,986
REALLY.

528
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,985
I'VE GOT BILLS TO PAY.

529
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:11,984
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

530
00:33:12,008 --> 00:33:14,980
GIVE ME HALF A REASON,
AND I'LL GO ANYWHERE.

531
00:33:15,004 --> 00:33:15,984
YOU WOULD?

532
00:33:16,008 --> 00:33:16,990
MM-HMM.

533
00:33:17,014 --> 00:33:17,986
I'VE SET SAIL FOR PLACES

534
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,996
BECAUSE I LIKE
THE SOUND OF THEIR NAME.

535
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,996
I'VE GONE TO PLACES
THAT NO ONE'S EVER BEEN TO

536
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,995
JUST TO SEE
WHAT'S OVER THE HORIZON.

537
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:27,998
DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?

538
00:33:28,022 --> 00:33:29,462
WELL, I KEEP
GOING OVER THIS,

539
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,022
AND THE MOST I CAN FIGURE OUT

540
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,022
IS TO GET AT THE ANTIDOTE
WE NEED TO FIND A...

541
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,991
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THIS WORD?

542
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,994
MUST BE SOME KIND OF
SECRET KEEPER OR PRIEST.

543
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:40,992
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

544
00:33:41,016 --> 00:33:42,988
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

545
00:33:43,012 --> 00:33:44,992
FROM THE WIZARD'S SPELL BOOK.

546
00:33:45,016 --> 00:33:47,018
HMM.

547
00:33:56,021 --> 00:33:57,988
HMM.

548
00:33:58,012 --> 00:34:01,018
MM-HMM.

549
00:34:43,018 --> 00:34:46,004
STRIKE THE FORESAIL!

550
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:55,007
BABU, SET THE SEA ANCHOR!

551
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,989
MMM! MMM!

552
00:35:15,006 --> 00:35:16,021
YASHIM?

553
00:35:21,012 --> 00:35:22,023
YASHIM!

554
00:35:25,021 --> 00:35:27,021
YASHIM!

555
00:35:29,016 --> 00:35:31,005
OH!

556
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:33,022
OH!

557
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,021
BEHIND YOU.

558
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,022
OH!

559
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,997
AAH!

560
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:51,982
THEY'RE COMING OVER
THE PORT BOW!

561
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:55,000
THEY'RE OVER STARBOARD!

562
00:35:58,011 --> 00:36:01,006
AAH!

563
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:02,996
AAH!

564
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,020
AAH!

565
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,979
PRINCESS, LOOK OUT BEHIND YOU!

566
00:36:17,003 --> 00:36:17,999
AAH!

567
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:19,979
HOLD ON!

568
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:19,999
AAH!

569
00:36:20,023 --> 00:36:23,017
UHH! UHH! AAH!

570
00:36:24,011 --> 00:36:24,998
AAH! I'M COMING!

571
00:36:25,022 --> 00:36:27,015
HOLD ON!

572
00:36:29,004 --> 00:36:29,996
I WILL HACK YOU

573
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,021
INTO SUSHI!

574
00:37:00,021 --> 00:37:03,010
THAT WAS FOR YASHIM.

575
00:37:06,022 --> 00:37:07,994
OH!

576
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,022
SINBAD! OOH!

577
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,017
HA! AAH!

578
00:37:19,014 --> 00:37:21,007
WHAT THE...

579
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,993
YAAH! OOH!

580
00:37:24,017 --> 00:37:26,019
AAH! AAH!

581
00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:51,013
UHH! HUNH!

582
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,021
AAH!

583
00:38:07,012 --> 00:38:09,017
YAAH!

584
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:14,997
OHH! OHH!

585
00:38:15,021 --> 00:38:17,015
TAKE THAT!

586
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:20,023
BACK TO HELL WITH YOU!

587
00:38:44,018 --> 00:38:45,983
GOOD! GIVE ME ANOTHER SHOT!

588
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:47,982
CLOSER! COME ON!

589
00:38:48,006 --> 00:38:49,019
AAH!

590
00:38:51,019 --> 00:38:53,984
MUSTAFA,
IT'S CAUGHT IN THE RIGGING!

591
00:38:54,008 --> 00:38:56,003
PIKE THAT TENTACLE!

592
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:17,016
NO.

593
00:39:20,003 --> 00:39:22,022
EVER SEEN
LIGHTNING AND WATER MIX?

594
00:40:16,007 --> 00:40:18,986
YOU MAY HAVE GOTTEN AWAY
THIS TIME.

595
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,022
NEXT TIME,

596
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,997
YOU DIE.

597
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:33,986
YOU DID WELL TODAY.

598
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,997
YOU WEREN'T HALF BAD YOURSELF...

599
00:40:37,021 --> 00:40:39,018
CAPTAIN.

600
00:40:49,023 --> 00:40:51,991
THAT'S A PRETTY TUNE.

601
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:54,995
BUT NOTHING LIKE
THE MUSIC OF THE SEA.

602
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:57,021
LISTEN.

603
00:41:14,003 --> 00:41:15,982
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

604
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:19,022
IF YOU LISTEN,
YOU CAN ALWAYS HEAR IT.

605
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,997
LOOK.

606
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:35,021
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE SINGING.

607
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,995
IN ALL YOUR TRAVELS,

608
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:52,990
YOU MUST HAVE MET A LOT
OF INTERESTING PEOPLE.

609
00:41:53,014 --> 00:41:54,984
I ONCE MET A MAN
WHO COULD CALCULATE

610
00:41:55,008 --> 00:41:56,997
THE MOVEMENTS OF
THE STARS IN HIS HEAD.

611
00:41:57,021 --> 00:42:00,987
I BET YOU'VE ALSO MET
A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.

612
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:02,983
A FEW.

613
00:42:03,007 --> 00:42:03,990
ANYONE SPECIAL?

614
00:42:04,014 --> 00:42:05,996
I NEVER STAYED LONG
ENOUGH TO FIND OUT.

615
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,980
YOU EVER THINK OF BRINGING
SOMEONE WITH YOU TO SEA?

616
00:42:10,004 --> 00:42:11,019
NO. OH.

617
00:42:12,013 --> 00:42:12,991
AND YOU MUST HAVE HAD PRINCES

618
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:14,997
FROM EVERY KINGDOM COURTING YOU.

619
00:42:15,021 --> 00:42:17,018
A FEW.

620
00:42:34,021 --> 00:42:36,020
DEAD AHEAD!

621
00:42:58,022 --> 00:42:59,999
IS THAT...

622
00:43:00,023 --> 00:43:01,995
THE VEIL OF MISTS.

623
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:03,995
THEY SAY THAT ON THE OTHER SIDE

624
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:05,986
THERE ARE MAGIC FOUNTAINS...

625
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:08,983
ONE DRINK AND YOUR
WILDEST WISH COMES TRUE.

626
00:43:09,007 --> 00:43:11,983
MOOK IS GOING TO WISH
HE WAS 7 FEET TALL.

627
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:12,023
HEH HEH HEH HEH!

628
00:43:13,001 --> 00:43:13,981
I WISH FOR A NEW COOK...

629
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:14,996
SOMEONE WHO KNOW
HOW TO USE A WOK.

630
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,986
AND WHO CAN SEE OVER THE TOP
OF HIS COOKBOOK.

631
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,993
THAT'S IT. I HAVE HAD IT
WITH THE SHORT JOKES.

632
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:22,995
WHEN I GET BEYOND THE VEIL

633
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:26,979
AND GET MY HANDS ON SOME
OF THAT SUPER MAGIC POTION,

634
00:43:27,003 --> 00:43:28,997
WE WILL SEE
WHO MAKES JOKES ON WHO.

635
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:29,996
WITH YOUR LUCK,

636
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,982
YOU'LL END UP EVEN SHORTER.

637
00:43:32,006 --> 00:43:33,984
GO AHEAD, CRACK WISE.

638
00:43:34,008 --> 00:43:36,995
THE NEXT ONE WHO DOES,
I'LL CUT HIM DOWN TO SIZE.

639
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:37,992
AH HA!

640
00:43:38,016 --> 00:43:41,022
LOOK, THE TOWER OF TERROR.

641
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:51,023
ALL MY LIFE, I HAVE
HEARD THE STORIES

642
00:43:52,001 --> 00:43:52,981
ABOUT THIS VEIL.

643
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:53,991
MUSTAFA FEARS NOTHING.

644
00:43:54,015 --> 00:43:56,996
MUSTAFA ALSO HAVE
NOTHING TO LOSE.

645
00:43:59,008 --> 00:43:59,996
I FEEL SO...

646
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:00,998
RESPONSIBLE?

647
00:44:01,022 --> 00:44:03,005
YES.

648
00:44:05,021 --> 00:44:05,991
I'M SORRY.

649
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:11,002
I'VE PUT YOU IN A TERRIBLE SPOT.

650
00:44:15,018 --> 00:44:16,999
MEN, I'VE NEVER ASKED YOU
TO DO ANYTHING

651
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:21,010
THAT I WOULDN'T DO MYSELF.

652
00:44:22,002 --> 00:44:25,994
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR
OF SAILING BEYOND THE VEIL,

653
00:44:26,018 --> 00:44:26,994
SAY, "AYE."

654
00:44:27,018 --> 00:44:29,990
IF YOU GO, I GO.

655
00:44:30,014 --> 00:44:32,014
WE ALL GO.

656
00:44:34,011 --> 00:44:35,992
AYE. AYE.

657
00:44:36,016 --> 00:44:37,023
AYE!

658
00:44:38,001 --> 00:44:38,981
AYE.

659
00:44:39,005 --> 00:44:41,001
AYE.

660
00:44:48,022 --> 00:44:49,999
NO, NO.

661
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:54,000
NOT YET. NOT YET!

662
00:44:57,022 --> 00:44:59,987
NO.

663
00:45:00,011 --> 00:45:02,010
I'VE LOST THEM.

664
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:07,001
NO!

665
00:45:09,021 --> 00:45:11,994
MUSTAFA,
READY AT THE HELM.

666
00:45:12,018 --> 00:45:14,022
AYE, CAPTAIN.

667
00:45:17,021 --> 00:45:21,010
BABU, RUN A SOUNDING.

668
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:25,011
10 FATHOMS.

669
00:45:26,021 --> 00:45:28,011
15.

670
00:45:29,003 --> 00:45:29,996
25.

671
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,991
HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN A FOG THIS THICK?

672
00:45:33,015 --> 00:45:33,999
NEVER.

673
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:36,022
40 FATHOMS.

674
00:45:37,023 --> 00:45:38,991
50.

675
00:45:39,015 --> 00:45:40,991
DEEP WATER.

676
00:45:41,015 --> 00:45:44,017
STILL NO BOTTOM, CAPTAIN.

677
00:46:08,022 --> 00:46:09,988
HA HA!

678
00:46:10,012 --> 00:46:10,989
HA, HEY!

679
00:46:11,013 --> 00:46:11,999
WE MADE IT!

680
00:46:12,023 --> 00:46:13,979
WE DID IT! WE DID IT!

681
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:16,997
WE'RE THE FIRST ONES TO SAIL
THROUGH THE VEIL OF MISTS!

682
00:46:20,011 --> 00:46:21,988
HIP, HIP, HOORAY!

683
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:22,992
HIP, HIP, HOORAY!

684
00:46:23,016 --> 00:46:26,997
HIP, HIP, HOORAY!

685
00:46:35,005 --> 00:46:36,990
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

686
00:46:37,014 --> 00:46:37,999
WE'VE GOT A CURRENT.

687
00:46:38,023 --> 00:46:42,994
I KNOW, AND IT'S TAKING US
RIGHT INTO THE ROCKS.

688
00:46:43,018 --> 00:46:46,003
WE'RE TURNING AROUND.

689
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:47,996
LOWER THE BOAT.

690
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:50,016
RIG THE TOW LINE.

691
00:46:54,001 --> 00:46:54,983
HMM. THEY CALL THIS

692
00:46:55,007 --> 00:46:59,005
A LIFE OF ROMANCE AND ADVENTURE.

693
00:47:00,021 --> 00:47:01,996
SUNSTROKE'S MORE LIKE IT.

694
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,985
GALLEY SLAVES
AT LEAST GET SHADE.

695
00:47:05,009 --> 00:47:06,989
I WASN'T RAISED TO BE A ROWER.

696
00:47:07,013 --> 00:47:09,023
I AM A CHEF.

697
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:17,996
WHAT DOES THAT
SOUND LIKE TO YOU?

698
00:47:22,003 --> 00:47:22,984
A GROWL...

699
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:26,012
LIKE... LIKE A MONSTER.

700
00:47:43,017 --> 00:47:45,984
ROCKS LIKE THAT'LL RIP RIGHT
THROUGH THE SHIP.

701
00:47:46,008 --> 00:47:49,007
10 POINTS STARBOARD!

702
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:54,021
ANOTHER 10!

703
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,012
HARD ALEE! NOW!

704
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:19,981
TOSS THE ANCHOR!

705
00:48:20,005 --> 00:48:22,007
TRY TO CATCH A MOORING!

706
00:48:23,016 --> 00:48:26,022
STAY BACK FROM THE RAIL
AND HANG ON TIGHT!

707
00:48:41,022 --> 00:48:44,023
SINBAD, LOOK!

708
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,018
THE MEN CAN'T ROW AGAINST
A CURRENT LIKE THIS.

709
00:49:12,021 --> 00:49:16,021
I CAN'T LET THEM
GET PULLED OVER WITH US.

710
00:49:18,023 --> 00:49:20,007
HUNH!

711
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,985
LET ME TRY, PRINCESS.

712
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:48,001
LET'S HOPE WE CAN
CATCH A MOORING.

713
00:50:14,017 --> 00:50:16,982
STEER FOR THAT EDDY!
IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE!

714
00:50:17,006 --> 00:50:20,023
IF WE DON'T MAKE IT,
JUMP SHIP AND SWIM FOR IT!

715
00:50:47,004 --> 00:50:48,987
TAKE THE PRINCESS.
GO OFF THE PROW.

716
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:53,015
FROM THAT ROCK UP FRONT,
YOU CAN REACH THE OTHERS.

717
00:50:59,005 --> 00:51:00,990
I GAVE YOU AN ORDER!

718
00:51:01,014 --> 00:51:03,019
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!

719
00:51:05,005 --> 00:51:06,018
GO!

720
00:51:10,023 --> 00:51:13,019
MY PLACE IS WITH YOU!

721
00:51:15,013 --> 00:51:18,023
YOU CAN'T HOLD THIS ALONE!
I CAN!

722
00:51:19,001 --> 00:51:19,979
HE'S NOT ALONE.

723
00:51:20,003 --> 00:51:21,990
WITH THE TWO OF US HOLDING,
YOU CAN MAKE THE BOAT.

724
00:51:22,014 --> 00:51:22,998
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

725
00:51:23,022 --> 00:51:23,999
I GOT US INTO THIS MESS.

726
00:51:24,023 --> 00:51:28,018
IF ANYBODY'S GOING TO STAY,
IT'S GOING TO BE ME.

727
00:51:36,023 --> 00:51:39,014
I CANNOT LET YOU DIE.

728
00:51:44,007 --> 00:51:44,999
MUSTAFA!

729
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,021
NO!

730
00:51:53,018 --> 00:51:55,016
WHAT'S HE DOING?

731
00:51:57,001 --> 00:51:58,995
HE'S TRYING TO LIFT
THE KEEL OVER THAT ROCK

732
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:00,999
SO WE DON'T UPEND AS WE GO OVER.

733
00:52:01,023 --> 00:52:03,023
IT MIGHT SAVE OUR LIVES!

734
00:52:04,001 --> 00:52:05,982
BUT HE'LL BE CRUSHED!

735
00:52:06,006 --> 00:52:08,003
HE KNOWS!

736
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,021
SERENA?

737
00:52:41,004 --> 00:52:43,006
SERENA?

738
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,020
SERENA?

739
00:52:57,002 --> 00:52:59,020
I THOUGHT I'D LOST YOU.

740
00:53:01,019 --> 00:53:03,018
WHERE'S...

741
00:53:11,004 --> 00:53:15,019
AT LEAST THE CREW HAS A CHANCE.

742
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:20,011
I HOPE SO.

743
00:53:37,016 --> 00:53:42,010
THE <i>TREASURE SEEKER</i> WAS MY LIFE.

744
00:53:49,005 --> 00:53:51,017
SERENA.

745
00:53:58,008 --> 00:54:01,018
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

746
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:08,020
IT MEANS WE HAVE
A LONG WALK AHEAD OF US.

747
00:54:18,001 --> 00:54:19,022
WOW.

748
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:28,020
THIS PLACE IS VERY CREEPY.

749
00:54:34,018 --> 00:54:37,010
WATCH YOUR STEP.

750
00:54:44,022 --> 00:54:44,992
AAH!

751
00:54:45,016 --> 00:54:47,016
CAREFUL! IT'S A LONG WAY DOWN.

752
00:54:59,021 --> 00:55:00,998
UGH. SPIDER WEBS.

753
00:55:01,022 --> 00:55:02,999
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I CAN'T STAND,

754
00:55:03,023 --> 00:55:06,016
IT'S SPIDERS.

755
00:55:18,011 --> 00:55:24,017
THE SYMBOL AGAIN. AND STATUES.

756
00:55:29,007 --> 00:55:29,995
OHH!

757
00:55:30,019 --> 00:55:32,986
PRINCESS, DON'T MOVE.

758
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:33,996
WHAT? SPIDER.

759
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:38,995
UGH. I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY GREW THAT BIG.

760
00:55:39,019 --> 00:55:42,021
LOOK, STAIRS!

761
00:55:59,006 --> 00:56:01,983
THESE ARE JUST TAKING US
FARTHER DOWN.

762
00:56:02,007 --> 00:56:02,980
ARE YOU SURE WE SHOULD KEEP...

763
00:56:03,004 --> 00:56:06,019
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

764
00:56:41,019 --> 00:56:42,991
RUN!

765
00:56:43,015 --> 00:56:47,007
A SPIDER! HAD TO BE A SPIDER!

766
00:56:51,019 --> 00:56:51,998
UNH!

767
00:56:52,022 --> 00:56:53,991
GET OUT OF THE CAVE!

768
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:56,979
UNH! AAH!

769
00:56:57,003 --> 00:56:57,990
SINBAD!

770
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:07,996
ARE YOU CRAZY? GET OUT OF HERE!

771
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:11,001
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU!

772
00:57:12,005 --> 00:57:13,996
SAVE YOURSELF, SERENA!

773
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:18,008
OH!

774
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:34,017
UNH!

775
00:57:38,018 --> 00:57:42,015
YOU WANT TO PLAY ROUGH? TRY ME!

776
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:02,022
UNH! SOUNDS LIKE WOOD!

777
00:58:03,006 --> 00:58:04,019
I'VE GOT AN IDEA!

778
00:58:10,014 --> 00:58:11,022
YAAH! UNH!

779
00:58:16,021 --> 00:58:18,020
AAH! UNH!

780
00:58:24,019 --> 00:58:24,996
NOW HE'S MAD!

781
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,990
I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

782
00:58:28,014 --> 00:58:30,008
SO DO I!

783
00:58:31,015 --> 00:58:32,985
HERE! QUICK!

784
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:34,022
UNH!

785
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:42,006
COME ON, YOU OVERGROWN
PIECE OF DRIFTWOOD!

786
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:46,021
HAH!

787
00:58:51,012 --> 00:58:51,989
NEED A LIGHT?

788
00:58:57,013 --> 00:58:57,996
SMART IDEA.

789
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:01,000
I THOUGHT SO.

790
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:13,022
YOU KNOW WHEN I SAID
FIRE WAS SMART? I LIED.

791
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,020
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOUR IDEA.

792
00:59:17,022 --> 00:59:18,986
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

793
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:22,023
WELL, UH, USUALLY I WOULD...

794
00:59:23,001 --> 00:59:25,022
UH...

795
00:59:27,015 --> 00:59:28,987
HOW ABOUT IF WE JUST JUMP?

796
00:59:29,011 --> 00:59:31,004
THAT'LL WORK.

797
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:38,020
AAH! AAH!

798
01:00:25,019 --> 01:00:27,004
SINBAD!

799
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:30,010
SERENA!

800
01:01:15,021 --> 01:01:20,001
IT'S... IT'S SEPARATING
THE FISH! GRAB ON!

801
01:01:22,021 --> 01:01:26,021
LIKE A FISHING NET,
IT'S SEPARATING THE CATCH!

802
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:10,016
I THINK THAT WE'VE
JUST FOUND THE FISHERMEN.

803
01:02:13,009 --> 01:02:13,991
DO YOU THINK THEY SAW US?

804
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:16,017
SO FAR, SO GOOD.

805
01:02:27,018 --> 01:02:29,992
MAYBE THOSE CREATURES
ARE FRIENDLY, SINBAD.

806
01:02:30,016 --> 01:02:31,983
I MAKE IT A RULE NOT
TO TRUST ANYBODY

807
01:02:32,007 --> 01:02:35,019
THAT BUILDS THINGS
THAT SWALLOW ME.

808
01:02:43,014 --> 01:02:45,019
THERE'S A PORTAL!

809
01:02:48,002 --> 01:02:52,021
THERE WAS A PICTURE OF
THIS PLACE IN BARAKA'S BOOK.

810
01:03:11,015 --> 01:03:14,021
THE SKY IS MOVING!

811
01:03:15,019 --> 01:03:17,023
THAT'S NOT THE SKY.

812
01:03:18,001 --> 01:03:21,003
THAT'S THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN.

813
01:03:30,021 --> 01:03:33,016
AND I THOUGHT
I'D SEEN EVERYTHING.

814
01:03:41,003 --> 01:03:42,995
THE SYMBOL. THAT'S IT!

815
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,982
HOW DO WE GET TO IT?

816
01:03:45,006 --> 01:03:49,001
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S
ONLY ONE WAY ACROSS.

817
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:57,019
A LITTLE SQUISHY,
BUT IT SHOULD HOLD US.

818
01:04:02,022 --> 01:04:05,022
I GUESS THE ONLY
WAY DOWN IS TO...

819
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,994
JUMP! JUMP!

820
01:04:24,006 --> 01:04:27,015
OH, BEAUTIFUL.

821
01:04:29,006 --> 01:04:34,010
GIANT FLYING MUSHROOMS.
NOW I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING.

822
01:04:45,012 --> 01:04:48,999
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY'RE ALIVE.

823
01:04:49,023 --> 01:04:52,004
THIS COULDN'T GET ANY WEIRDER.

824
01:05:01,015 --> 01:05:04,011
OK, IT COULD.

825
01:05:08,022 --> 01:05:12,017
THEY'RE FARMERS.

826
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:21,001
SINBAD, NO!

827
01:05:27,021 --> 01:05:30,021
WE MEAN YOU NO HARM.

828
01:05:33,002 --> 01:05:35,018
SHOW HIM THE PAGE.

829
01:05:38,019 --> 01:05:41,016
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS?

830
01:05:59,018 --> 01:06:00,993
THE WATER FLOWS UPWARD.

831
01:06:01,017 --> 01:06:03,978
HOW CAN THAT HAPPEN?

832
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:04,985
YOU'RE ASKING ME?

833
01:06:05,009 --> 01:06:09,006
I GOT LOST BACK AT
THE MANTA RAY THING.

834
01:06:17,023 --> 01:06:21,003
ALWAYS WANTED TO WALK ON WATER.

835
01:06:44,006 --> 01:06:46,988
ARE YOU HAVING AS MUCH
TROUBLE BREATHING AS I AM?

836
01:06:47,012 --> 01:06:49,022
THE AIR FEELS THIN.

837
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:08,022
WHY HAVE YOU COME?

838
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,996
OH, YOU SPEAK OUR LANGUAGE?

839
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:14,004
I SPEAK MANY LANGUAGES.

840
01:07:15,001 --> 01:07:16,987
WHAT BROUGHT YOU HERE?

841
01:07:17,011 --> 01:07:19,018
THIS.

842
01:07:23,012 --> 01:07:25,022
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

843
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:29,981
WHY HAVE YOU COME HERE?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

844
01:07:30,005 --> 01:07:30,985
THIS SYMBOL...

845
01:07:31,009 --> 01:07:31,987
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

846
01:07:32,011 --> 01:07:37,988
IT REPRESENTS
THE PATH OF WATER... OF LIFE...

847
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:42,022
YIELDING AND RESISTANT.
THAT BOOK?

848
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,020
A WIZARD NAMED BARAKA
WASHED UP ON OUR SHORE.

849
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,980
HE TOOK MY FATHER FROM ME.

850
01:07:50,004 --> 01:07:52,023
ALL WE WANT IS WHAT
WE NEED TO GET HIM BACK.

851
01:07:53,001 --> 01:07:53,985
WE MEAN YOU NO HARM.

852
01:07:54,009 --> 01:07:56,023
DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN? BARAKA?

853
01:07:57,001 --> 01:08:00,996
HE IS NOT A MAN LIKE YOU.
HE IS...

854
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:05,002
HE'S ONE OF YOU, ISN'T HE?

855
01:08:07,018 --> 01:08:08,998
MY BROTHER.

856
01:08:09,022 --> 01:08:11,996
MY BROTHER WAS ALWAYS DIFFERENT.

857
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:14,994
HE DREAMED OF DOMINATION.

858
01:08:15,018 --> 01:08:18,985
HE COULD NOT STAY AMONG US.

859
01:08:19,009 --> 01:08:23,023
HE WENT ABOVE THE WATERS.

860
01:08:24,023 --> 01:08:25,997
TO MY FATHER'S KINGDOM.

861
01:08:26,021 --> 01:08:31,978
UNTIL TODAY, THEY THOUGHT
YOUR KIND WERE A MYTH.

862
01:08:32,002 --> 01:08:35,989
CREATURES FROM TALES
WE TELL OUR CHILDREN.

863
01:08:36,013 --> 01:08:38,022
MOSTLY... TO SCARE THEM.

864
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,999
BUT YOU AND YOUR BROTHER
KNOW ALL ABOUT US.

865
01:08:42,023 --> 01:08:44,985
THEORIES AND GUESSES.

866
01:08:45,009 --> 01:08:45,989
THEORIES AND GUESSES

867
01:08:46,013 --> 01:08:48,023
WOULDN'T HAVE TAUGHT
YOU OUR LANGUAGE.

868
01:08:49,001 --> 01:08:51,023
HOW DO YOU KNOW SO MUCH?

869
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:25,018
WOW!

870
01:09:27,009 --> 01:09:29,000
AMAZING.

871
01:09:51,019 --> 01:09:52,985
THIS PLACE, IT'S...

872
01:09:53,009 --> 01:09:56,980
MOST OF WHAT WE KNOW
ABOUT YOUR KIND,

873
01:09:57,004 --> 01:09:58,981
WE LEARNED FROM THIS.

874
01:09:59,005 --> 01:10:01,000
SHIPWRECKS.

875
01:10:16,006 --> 01:10:18,020
A MUSIC BOX?

876
01:10:20,002 --> 01:10:21,994
YOU DON'T HAVE MUSIC?

877
01:10:22,018 --> 01:10:25,997
ONLY THE MUSIC OF THE SEA.

878
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:26,998
OF COURSE.

879
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:30,989
SINBAD, THIS WRECK
IS FROM THE ROYAL FLEET.

880
01:10:31,013 --> 01:10:33,991
ARE THOSE...

881
01:10:34,015 --> 01:10:35,980
MY MOTHER AND FATHER.

882
01:10:36,004 --> 01:10:39,981
SO THIS IS HOW BARAKA
LEARNED OF YOUR KINGDOM...

883
01:10:40,005 --> 01:10:41,979
HIS CHANCE TO RULE.

884
01:10:42,003 --> 01:10:42,023
YOU'RE HURT.

885
01:10:43,001 --> 01:10:44,991
SERENA,
THAT SCRATCH ON YOUR ARM,

886
01:10:45,015 --> 01:10:46,998
IS THAT FROM THE SPIDER?

887
01:10:47,022 --> 01:10:48,980
MMM!

888
01:10:49,004 --> 01:10:50,983
LET HIM LOOK AT IT.

889
01:10:51,007 --> 01:10:52,990
DO NOT BE AFRAID.

890
01:10:53,014 --> 01:10:55,987
WE HARM NO ONE HERE.

891
01:10:56,011 --> 01:10:59,014
THAT IS OUR WAY.

892
01:11:05,003 --> 01:11:08,015
IS THIS THE POTION I NEED?

893
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:13,022
HEALED! LIKE MAGIC!

894
01:11:18,022 --> 01:11:20,022
YOU CAN BARELY BREATHE.

895
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,018
YOU HAVE SO LITTLE TIME.

896
01:11:29,016 --> 01:11:32,015
FOR MY BROTHER.

897
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:36,015
THANK YOU.

898
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:37,999
I AM SORRY.

899
01:11:38,023 --> 01:11:43,015
ESPECIALLY FOR WHAT
MY BROTHER HAS DONE.

900
01:11:44,013 --> 01:11:47,023
THANK YOU AND GOOD-BYE.

901
01:12:05,001 --> 01:12:07,019
SINBAD, LOOK!

902
01:12:12,023 --> 01:12:14,021
JUMP FOR IT!

903
01:12:35,005 --> 01:12:39,004
WE'LL HEAD
FOR THAT WHIRLPOOL!

904
01:13:05,021 --> 01:13:07,985
UHH. CAN WE GET HOME ON THIS?

905
01:13:08,009 --> 01:13:09,991
WELL, I WAS
TRAINED MORE AS A SAILOR

906
01:13:10,015 --> 01:13:12,985
THAN AS A... A MUSHROOM PILOT,

907
01:13:13,009 --> 01:13:15,009
BUT I'LL TRY.

908
01:13:29,002 --> 01:13:30,999
A LITTLE HIGHER.

909
01:13:31,023 --> 01:13:31,998
HIGHER.

910
01:13:32,022 --> 01:13:33,999
UP! UP!

911
01:13:34,023 --> 01:13:35,986
UHH! OHH!

912
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:38,983
ALL RIGHT.

913
01:13:39,007 --> 01:13:39,990
UHH!

914
01:13:40,014 --> 01:13:40,997
I CAN'T... HIGHER!

915
01:13:41,021 --> 01:13:43,999
THIS IS AS FAR AS I CAN, YOU...

916
01:13:44,023 --> 01:13:47,015
UHH! OHH-HO!

917
01:13:54,014 --> 01:13:55,989
EXCELLENT.

918
01:13:56,013 --> 01:13:56,992
ORDER AN ASSEMBLY.

919
01:13:57,016 --> 01:14:01,008
PREPARE THE PRISONERS.

920
01:14:04,013 --> 01:14:06,016
ON YOUR FEET!

921
01:14:07,005 --> 01:14:10,022
OH. MOVE... FOOT.

922
01:14:13,007 --> 01:14:15,980
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

923
01:14:16,004 --> 01:14:17,984
JUDGMENT DAY.

924
01:14:18,008 --> 01:14:19,983
WHAT IF WE'RE TOO LATE?

925
01:14:20,007 --> 01:14:20,979
DON'T WORRY.

926
01:14:21,003 --> 01:14:22,982
WE'VE GOT STRONG WINDS,
CLEAR SKIES,

927
01:14:23,006 --> 01:14:24,998
AND A FULL-THRESH SAIL.

928
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,994
ARGH! UNHAND ME,

929
01:14:39,018 --> 01:14:43,016
YOU PUS-PICKLED PISSANTS!

930
01:14:45,019 --> 01:14:48,023
WHAT CRIME AM I CHARGED WITH?

931
01:14:49,001 --> 01:14:51,023
HIGH TREASON. SUBVERSION.

932
01:14:52,001 --> 01:14:53,984
ATTEMPTED MURDER.

933
01:14:54,008 --> 01:14:55,997
AND GENERAL NAIVETé.

934
01:14:56,021 --> 01:14:56,994
LET HIM GO!

935
01:14:57,018 --> 01:14:59,993
HE HAS DONE NOTHING
TO DESERVE THIS.

936
01:15:00,017 --> 01:15:00,986
I REFUSE TO STAND BY

937
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:03,988
AND WATCH AN INNOCENT MAN DIE.

938
01:15:04,012 --> 01:15:07,997
FINE. YOU GO FIRST.

939
01:15:11,012 --> 01:15:14,999
MISJUDGED THE BREEZE,
YOUR MAJESTY.

940
01:15:15,023 --> 01:15:19,022
YOU'VE MISJUDGED MY PATIENCE.

941
01:15:23,016 --> 01:15:23,995
TODAY,

942
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:26,982
WE CARRY OUT THE SENTENCE
OF THE ASSEMBLY OF JUSTICE.

943
01:15:27,006 --> 01:15:32,007
I GUESS <i>WE</i><i>MUST</i>
HAVE MISSED THE TRIAL.

944
01:15:42,015 --> 01:15:46,003
THERE IT IS! OVER THERE!

945
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:55,996
WE OFFERED THIS STRANGER
FRIENDSHIP,

946
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:57,994
AND HE BETRAYED US.

947
01:16:01,001 --> 01:16:04,978
WE GAVE HIM FOOD,
HE GAVE US POISON.

948
01:16:05,002 --> 01:16:07,999
HE REPAID OUR KINDNESS
WITH CRIMES.

949
01:16:08,023 --> 01:16:10,999
I COULD FORGIVE HIM
FOR TRYING TO KILL ME,

950
01:16:11,023 --> 01:16:15,990
BUT NEVER FOR WHAT HE'S DONE
TO MY DEAR DAUGHTER.

951
01:16:16,014 --> 01:16:17,996
THE DEAR, DEAR GIRL

952
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:20,998
WHO SHOULD HAVE
AND WOULD HAVE BECOME...

953
01:16:21,022 --> 01:16:23,023
YOUR QUEEN.

954
01:16:31,006 --> 01:16:33,993
DO YOU WANT A HOOD?

955
01:16:34,017 --> 01:16:36,991
SINCE THIS IS HIS FACE,
NOT MINE,

956
01:16:37,015 --> 01:16:41,015
I WANT THE PEOPLE
TO WATCH <i>HIM</i><i>DIE.</i>

957
01:16:47,008 --> 01:16:48,989
WHAT IS THAT?

958
01:16:49,013 --> 01:16:49,980
WHAT IS THAT?

959
01:16:50,004 --> 01:16:51,979
IT'S COMING RIGHT FOR US!

960
01:16:52,003 --> 01:16:52,979
LOOK!

961
01:16:53,003 --> 01:16:53,984
WHAT IS IT?!

962
01:16:54,008 --> 01:16:55,022
DO IT! NOW!

963
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,004
I SAID DO IT!

964
01:17:01,021 --> 01:17:03,022
IT'S STUCK.

965
01:17:17,022 --> 01:17:19,020
ALLOW ME.

966
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,010
SINBAD!

967
01:17:52,007 --> 01:17:54,022
SINBAD! USE THE POTION!

968
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,989
UHH! BROUGHT YOU A GIFT.

969
01:17:57,013 --> 01:17:59,022
IT'S FROM YOUR BROTHER!

970
01:18:15,001 --> 01:18:20,006
AAH!

971
01:18:29,002 --> 01:18:31,001
FATHER!

972
01:18:33,013 --> 01:18:33,982
UP WE GO.

973
01:18:34,006 --> 01:18:35,997
UHH, I THOUGHT I'D LOST YA.

974
01:18:36,021 --> 01:18:37,979
YOU LITTLE WHIPPERSNAPPER.

975
01:18:38,003 --> 01:18:42,003
HA HA. CAN'T GET RID OF ME
THAT EASY, JACK.

976
01:18:43,012 --> 01:18:47,007
WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S THE END OF HIM.

977
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,997
WHEW. LOOKS LIKE
MOOK'S FISH STEW.

978
01:18:50,021 --> 01:18:55,009
I BEG YOU, YOUR MAJESTY.

979
01:18:57,006 --> 01:19:02,001
NEXT TIME USE YOUR EARS,
NOT JUST YOUR EYES.

980
01:19:06,005 --> 01:19:09,022
SINBAD? COME HERE.

981
01:19:11,022 --> 01:19:12,990
LOOK!

982
01:19:13,014 --> 01:19:14,978
DID YOU MISS ME?

983
01:19:15,002 --> 01:19:16,023
HA HA HA! SINBAD!

984
01:19:16,123 --> 01:19:16,999
WE MADE IT!

985
01:19:17,023 --> 01:19:18,996
AHOY! AHOY!

986
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:22,017
AHOY!

987
01:19:24,014 --> 01:19:26,978
AND THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENED.

988
01:19:27,002 --> 01:19:28,322
THE LITTLE RUFFIAN SINBAD

989
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,240
LEARNED WHAT TRUE TREASURE WAS.

990
01:19:31,001 --> 01:19:31,985
AND THE KING'S DAUGHTER?

991
01:19:32,009 --> 01:19:33,998
WELL, SHE GOT TO
TRAVEL THE WORLD,

992
01:19:34,022 --> 01:19:36,993
SEE FAR-OFF LANDS, AND EVEN...

993
01:19:37,017 --> 01:19:40,982
WELL, THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.

994
01:19:41,006 --> 01:19:41,982
HEE HEE HEE HEE.
