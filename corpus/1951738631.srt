1
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,033
Thie is the story
of a time long ago.

2
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:38,567
A time of myth and legend,

3
00:00:38,567 --> 00:00:41,367
when the earth
was still young.

4
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:44,600
The ancient gods
were petty and cruel,

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,133
and they played mankind
for their sport.

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,000
Aaaagh!

7
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:52,100
Plaguing them with suffering,

8
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,300
besieging them with terrors.

9
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,167
( laughing )

10
00:00:57,167 --> 00:01:00,633
For centuries, the people
had nowhere to turn,

11
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:03,633
no one to look to for help.

12
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:06,100
Until... he arrived.

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,100
He was man
like no other.

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,133
Born of a beautiful
mortal woman,

15
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:15,600
but fathered by Zeus,
king of the gods.

16
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:21,533
Hercules possessed  strength
the world had never seen,

17
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:26,333
a strength surpassed
only by the power of his heart.

18
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:30,067
But everywhere he went he was
tormented by his stepmother,

19
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:33,700
Hera, the all-powerful
queen of the gods.

20
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:38,067
Hera's eternal obsession
was to destroy Hercules,

21
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:41,733
for he was the constant
living reminder of Zeus' infidelity.

22
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:05,267
No matter the obstacle,

23
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:08,867
as long as there were people
crying for help,

24
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:12,467
there was one man
who would never rest:

25
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:14,467
Hercules.

26
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:21,267

# To each other #

33
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:02,567
- Ah, Median.
- Mmm.

34
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:07,300
This time I'm gonna do it.
I'm really gonna do it.

35
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,333
Don't do it on my boots.
They cost me five dinar.

36
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:13,933
Ahh. No, you idiot.

37
00:03:13,933 --> 00:03:16,400
I'm gonna talk to her, to Critisa.

38
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,133
Yeah. You always say that.

39
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:21,533
All you ever end up doing is pouring
more wine down your throat.

40
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:23,333
Well, this time is different.

41
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,600
There's her house.
I'm gonna go up to her window.

42
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:29,633
And when she comes out
to see who it is,

43
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:32,833
I'm gonna tell her I love her.

44
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,833
You're crazy.

45
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,067
What if that isn't Critisa's window?

46
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:40,667
Why, then I'll pledge my love
to her sister...

47
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:43,400
and hope that she's pretty.

to your tiny town?

Is it entertainment ?

Is it opportunity?

70

Perhaps it is the chance
to win a prize.

any of us. ( Chuckles )

00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:25,433
Hey! You were great today.

177
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:29,200
But don't forget to jab,
jab a little more, and duck!

178
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,833
Don't forget to duck now
and then ( Chuckles )

179
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:44,567
I should have known Eryx was
another one of Hera's tricks.

180
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:48,067
What difference would it have made?
You would have gone anyway.

181
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:52,067
- That's who you are. People call for help--
- And I always go. I know.

182
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:55,067
- Yes.  - I can't stand to see the gods
play with people's lives,

183
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:56,567
anybody's lives.

184
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:58,067
I know that,

185
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:01,067
and I love that about you.

186
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:08,067
You got this from that great lion.

187
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:13,000
What would the people of Nemea
have done if you hadn't killed it for them?

188
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,667
And the Hydra that tormented
the Lernaeans?

189
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:22,167
What would have happened if you
hadn't have come to their aid?

190
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,667
And Tiphys.

191
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:27,167
Mmm.

192
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:31,667
Think of all the suffering he
caused until you stopped him.

193
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:38,100
And do I have to remind you
what happened in Saenia?

196
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:13,300
Nessus, what an I doing wrong?

197
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,400
Be patient, Hercules. You can't
just bully iron into shape.

198
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
You gotta mold it
Little by little, hmm?

199
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,467
Try heating it a little bit more.

200
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:27,600
( Children Laughing, Chattering )

201
00:18:30,967 --> 00:18:33,200
( Chuckles ) Hercules.

202
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:39,133
- Hey. Hercules!
- Huh?

203
00:18:39,133 --> 00:18:41,300
I think the harness
is hot enough now.

204
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,967
( Chuckles ) Yeah.

205
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:50,367
I guess I sort of got distracted.

206
00:18:50,367 --> 00:18:53,233
Sometimes I just can't believe
they're mine. Know what I mean?

207
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:56,667
Yeah. You're a lucky man, Hercules.

208
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:59,467
Yeah. I'd say I am. Thanks.

209

- ( Snorts )

210

( Clicking Tongue )

211
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,500
Dad! There's a girl coming!

212
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,000
- Are you Hercules?
- Yes, I am.

213
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,567
What is it? What's wrong?

214
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,900
- DEIANEIRA: What's happened?
- I don't know.

215
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,500
Bring her inside, quickly.

216
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,233
- I need your help. Please!
- Here. Drink this.

217
00:20:08,533 --> 00:20:10,933
There isn't any time.

218
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:13,733
I've traveled days and
nights to find Hercules.

219
00:20:13,733 --> 00:20:17,100
My village, Gryphon--
A hole has opened up.

220
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,100
I-It's choking everything.

221
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,833
- What do you mean? What kind of hole?
- A hole breathing death.

222
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:25,433
We've made sacrifices and offerings.

223
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:29,633
- Nothing's been able to stop it.
- I'm not sure that I could help.

224
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:32,900
You must! Please, you're our only hope.

225
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:36,067
I've come all this way
to lead you back with me.

226
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:40,033
- Please say you'll go.
- Get some rest.

227
00:20:40,033 --> 00:20:42,500
You need to sleep.

228
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,400
- MAN: What'll we drink to?
- To our protector, Hercules! May he live forever!

229
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
- To Hercules!
- ALL: To Hercules!

230
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,900
Hercules, Hercules, Hercules.

231
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,733
I'm gonna be sick if you all
don't shut up about Hercules.

232
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:03,067
Aw, shut your hole, Nessus! Hercules is
the greatest! There's no disputing it!

233
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:07,867
- None of us could even do a fraction of
what he does.  - NESSUS: Of course not.

234
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:10,267
But we're not half-god, are we?

235
00:21:10,767 --> 00:21:13,200
I-I work and sweat and make
offerings every day,

236
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,667
and I'm barely gettin' by.

237
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:19,800
How fair is that? You're blind.

238
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,867
You know that? All of you.
Just like Deianeira.

239
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:28,067
She praises him and fawns over him.

240
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:30,333
Like we can do no wrong.

241
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,300
He doesn't deserve her.

242
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,133
He's gone all the time, doing whatever
he can to make his name bigger.

243
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm the one that takes care of her.

244
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,433
You better watch your mouth,
you idiot half-horse!

245
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:45,233
If Hercules hears about what's
goin' on, there'll be trouble.

246
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:49,233
- ( Mug Slams On Table )
- Damn Hercules. I-I-I'm not afraid of him.

247
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:50,733
Not one bit.

248
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:55,033
I have the Goddess Hera
to rely on. Hmm?

249
00:21:55,033 --> 00:21:57,333
She watches over me.
She's my protector.

250
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,633
( Inhales ) I've had enough of all of you.

251
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:06,533
I'm going home beofre I hear
his damn hame raised again.

( Gasps ) Who's there?

255
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,100
Who is that?

256
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,867
What is it? Are you all right?
You're trembling.

257
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:36,067
I thought I saw something
outside the window.

258
00:22:36,533 --> 00:22:40,033
Well, you're safe now.
There's nobody there.

259
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:42,767
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
- Shh.

260
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:46,833
Don't give it another thought.
Just lay bacl and try to get some sleep.

261
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,267
Is Hercules gonna help my village?

262
00:22:49,267 --> 00:22:52,533
- Is he gonna come back with me?
- Yes, I think he is.

263
00:22:52,533 --> 00:22:55,767
Thank you. Thank both of you.

264
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:57,200
Good night.

Nessus, what are you doing?

268
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:28,733
Ahh. You see this?

269
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:34,900
It's perfect.
Ah, it's absolutely perfect.

270
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,333
Yes. Well, let's
just leave it for now.

271
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:42,767
You don't believe me, do you? That I can
do something better than Hercules?

272
00:23:42,767 --> 00:23:46,967
( Sighs ) I believe you, Nessus.
It's just that it's late.

273
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,267
I was surprised you could even sleep,
what with that girl here...

274
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:53,867
- to take your precious husband away.
- Nessus, what's wrong with you?

275

( Laughs ) With me?

276
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:58,167
It's what's wrong with you
that's the problem!

277
00:23:58,567 --> 00:24:01,400
You don't really trust him, do you?

278
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,800
You can't really believe
that he'll be faithful.

279
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,600
My husband? I'm sure of it.

280
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,000
Oh, come on!
They'll be alone together.

281
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,800
And Hercules is what Hercules is.

282
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,000
Think. Her smooth skin,
her glowing hair,

283
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,300
- her youth.
- That's enough. Good night.

284
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,333
I bet there's something else
I can do better than Hercules.

286

Now get out of my way.

Looks like a good day to travel.

I was afraid we might have rain,
but it looks like we're be just fine.

to get you there.

Nothing. I'm fine. It's just--

It's just that I'm gonna miss you,
that's all.

Why don't you go give your dad
a big kiss goodbye, okay?

303

I want to thank you for taking
such good care of me.

I was in a pretty horrid state
when I arrived.

It's nice to see that
you're feeling better today.

Oh, here. I want you to have this.

307

Absolutely not, Iole.
I can't accept this.

308
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,367
Please, Deianeira.

309
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:27,700
It would make me very happy
if you'd accept it and wear it.

310
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,633
All right, then. I will. Thank you.

311
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,300
- You gonna be good? You promise?
- Yep.

312
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,933
- Gonna miss me?
- No. ( Laughs )

- Yeah.

You'll never buy better! Fresh bread.

You get bread here now.
One dinar! Only one dinar.

321

My deepest sympath. I'm so sorry.

I don't know what you mean.

323
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,133
For the loss of your husband.
My condolences.

- My husband's fine.
- But you have the medallion.

325
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:50,067
That tells me you've lost your husband.

326
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:51,567
This was just a gift.

327
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:54,533
A gift from a sweet, beautiful girl?

328
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:57,533
Yes. How do you know that?
Do you know her?

329
00:27:58,033 --> 00:27:58,533

She's a Nurian Maiden.

331
00:28:02,967 --> 00:28:05,400
- Still, why would you think my husband was dead?
- When a task need be done.

These beautiful virgins can
persuade a man to attempt it.

333
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:14,333
No, not Hercules. She has no power
over him. If you'll excuse me.

334
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:16,767
She has power over all men.

335

From the moment of birth, she's
trained for this and only this.

336
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:25,167
She knows all there is to know
about love, charm...

337
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:27,167
and seduction.

338
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:31,133
She'll make your husband
fall in love with her.

339
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
And when he does,

340
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,600
he'll do everything she asks,

341
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:40,600
even though it leads him
to his death.

No, you're wrong.
This medallion doesn't mean anything.

343
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:48,500
I tried to tell myself that once.
( Gasps )

344
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:56,433
Deianeira, I don't think you should go.
She's just some old crazy woman.

345
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:58,933
But the things that she said!
She knew!

346
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:00,433
And I have to warn Hercules.

347
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:03,433
But it could be dangerous, and you're
not even sure you know the right way.

348
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:06,933
Please, just take care of the children.
That's all I'm asking.

349
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:16,367
- Aeson, come here.
- Why?

350
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:19,767
I have to go away for a while,
but I'll be back soon.

351
00:29:19,767 --> 00:29:21,967
Your Aunt Althea's gonna take care
of you, but you're a big boy.

352
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:24,133
- You're gonna take care of your brother
and sister.     - Okay.

353
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:27,433
- I love you.
- I love you too, Mom.

354
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,233
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

355
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:42,833
- How's it look down there? Any better?
This is probably?        - No!

356
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:45,633
I've been all the way to
the bend. It only gets deeper.

357
00:29:46,833 --> 00:29:51,667
This is probably the best spot
to cross. I'll get Iole.

358
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:56,467
Your beauty's so strong
it charms even the animals.

359
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:58,867
It shouldn't surprise me.

360
00:29:58,867 --> 00:30:01,267
Deianeira, what's wrong?

361
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:06,600
I know all about you, Iole. I know
about your breeding your training,

362
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,800
and how you have the power
to make men fall in love,

363
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,833
how you'll make a widow
and orphans out of a loving family.

364
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,267
But please, call this off.

365
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:17,500
Leave my family be.

366
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,467
I can't.

367
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:30,900
- ( Footsteps )
- Deianeira, what are you doing here?

368
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,233
I've come to warn you.
Thank the gods, you're all right!

369
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:35,733
Warn me? What are you talking about?

370
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,733
You've been tricked.
We've both been tricked.

371
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:42,633
You know this medallion, the one
Iole gave me? She's Nurian Maiden.

372
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,967
Deianeira, I know. I've known
since she first arrived.

373
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:48,967
- And you're still going with her?
- It'll be all right.

374
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:51,900
But she'll take you away from us
and we'll never see you again!

375
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,900
Please, please, come home.
She has these powers.

376
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,867
and she'll make you fall in love,
and you'll be willing to die for her.

377
00:30:57,867 --> 00:31:01,367
All this talk about powers
and dying, it's nonsense.

378
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:04,033
There's only one person in the world
I'd die for, and that's you.

379
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:06,467
Let me go and go what
I can for Iole's people.

380
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:08,967
Then I'll hurry right back home
to you. I promise.

381
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:15,667
At the very worst, I'll have
a new scar or two to show you.

382
00:31:18,567 --> 00:31:21,033
Now get yourself home.

383
00:31:21,033 --> 00:31:25,267
Nessus will go with you to
make sure you get there safely.

384
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:26,667
We better get going.

385
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,667
Good-bye.

386
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:45,967
Funny, isn't it? You travel all this
way because you love him so much.

387
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:48,367
And still, where are you? Alone.

388
00:31:48,767 --> 00:31:51,167
Watching as he leaves with
her for a second time.

389
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:55,967
Nessus, be quiet.
Hercules has a job to do.

390
00:31:56,433 --> 00:31:59,767
But why this job? Ask yourself that.

391
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:04,833
Why has he chosen to
abandon his family...

392
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:08,867
and go off risking his life
for this stranger?

393
00:32:08,867 --> 00:32:12,633
Could it be. Because she's a young,

394
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:14,900
beautiful virgin?

395
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,833
Mmm? Look at the way he carries her.

396
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:21,833
The way he holds her, it's tender.

397
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:25,833
Like a lover.
He used to carry you that way.

398
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:29,467
Do you remember? Hmm?
Or is it too long ago?

399
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,200
It's time to go. ( Gasps )

400
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,633
If you were mine, Deianeira,
You'd never be alone.

401
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:36,900
Let's go of me right now,

402
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:41,267
or when Hercules gets home I will
tell him about this and the other night!

403
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:44,400
There's only one way
to get through to you.

404
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,233
- One way to make you see things clearly,
like I do.   - Nessus, stop it!

405
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,467
I should have done this
a long time ago.

406
00:32:58,367 --> 00:33:00,333
There's no escape, and you know it.

407
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:03,833
So relax. You just might enjoy it.

408
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:07,300
Hercules! Help! Hercules!

409
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,233
What are you screaming about?

410
00:33:10,633 --> 00:33:14,467
DEIANEIRA: Help! Help!

411
00:33:14,467 --> 00:33:16,733
There is no Hercules!

412
00:33:16,733 --> 00:33:19,133
- Hercules, what is it?
- Keep quiet.

413
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:21,467
- DEIANEIRA: Hercules!
- NESSUS: He's gone.

414
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:26,233
- He's as good as dea--
- ( Arrow Thuds )

415
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:34,267
( Grunting )

416
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:38,633
( Gasping ) Hera.

417
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:41,633
I'm dying.

418
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:44,133
You were supposed to protect me.

419
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:46,567
( Thunderclap )

420
00:33:48,033 --> 00:33:54,500
Deianeira. What vile thing have
I become to have done this to you?

421
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,300
To end up like this. ( Gasps )

422
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,333
It was only because I love you.

423
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:02,500
I couldn't stand knowing the pain,

424
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,133
the unhappiness he'd bring you.

425
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:08,800
But he won't, he'll be true to me.

426
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,567
- There is a way you can be sure of that.
- But I am sure.

427
00:34:12,567 --> 00:34:14,067
Listen to me.

428
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:18,067
My blood is a powerful potion.
( Choking )

429
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:20,067
Give the cloak to Hercules.

430
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:23,733
Once he puts it on, he'll
never be unfaithful to you.

431
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:26,367
I told you, I don't doubt him.

432
00:34:26,367 --> 00:34:27,567
But you do!

433
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:35,967
Be sure. Give it to him.

434
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,133
( Gasping )

435
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:50,000
Deianeira! Are you all right?

436
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,800
I'm fine.

437
00:34:51,267 --> 00:34:54,767
- This is my fault.
- No, everything's okay.

438
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:58,167
- We'll head back hom tonight.
-No, you just go on.

439
00:34:58,167 --> 00:35:00,533
- Deianeira, I'm not.
- No. You must go on.

440
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:01,467
Hercules?

441
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,700
And then take this.

442
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,600
And when it gets cold at night, I want you
to wrap this around you and think only of me.

443
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,600
I'll think of nothing else.

444
00:35:40,667 --> 00:35:44,033
( Rumbling, Howling Sounds )

445
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:56,033
( Roaring Sounds )

446
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:07,400
I'm tired of talking about me.
I want to hear more about you.

447
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,600
Tell me some stories
about the great Hercules.

448
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,400
Ah, there's not that much to tell.
I just do what I do.

449
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,400
Besides, I want to know more about
your being a Nurian Maiden.

450
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,967
You haven't told me why you
decided to become one.

451
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:24,100
Well, it wasn't really my decision.

452
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,800
Before I was born,
my mother had a vision...

453
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:30,300
that I'd be called upon
to save my village.

454
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,300
- I was wearing a blue stone medallion.
- Hmm.

455
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,800
So she and my father sent me off
to train as a Nurian Maiden.

456
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,300
And here I am.

457
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,800
What about the stories I have heard
of your special powers and all that?

458
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:47,833
That's nonsense. Fools' talk. you,
of all people, must know how that is.

459
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:52,233
According to the stories about the
great and powerful Hercules,

460
00:36:52,233 --> 00:36:55,033
- You're supposed to be ten feet tall.
- Hmm.

461
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:58,233
Some of the crazy things
they say you've done!

462
00:36:58,233 --> 00:37:01,833
Do you know that you supposedly
slew a two-headed giant?

463
00:37:02,233 --> 00:37:05,600
You killed the Lernaean Hydra
by yourself.

464
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,100
Or best of all, someone once told me...

465
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:12,100
that you killed Anienormous sea monster by
squeezing its heart until it stopped beating!

466
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:15,533
But those stories are true.

467
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:19,467
No. I-- I mean it.
I really did all those things.

468
00:37:19,467 --> 00:37:22,633
So maybe Hercules does have
a tale or two after all.

469
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:27,633
Come on. Tell me a few more.

470
00:37:27,633 --> 00:37:30,833
( Chuckles ) That's enough stories.
We'd better get to Gryphon.

471
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:53,733
Oh, look. There's an inn.
We can get something to eat.

472
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,533
( Man Growling, Dog Barking )

473
00:37:59,533 --> 00:38:01,967
I think you'd better stay out here.

474
00:38:03,967 --> 00:38:07,033
( Growling Continues )

475
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:11,400
- ( Crash )
- ( Growling, Snarling )

476
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,733
( Woman Screams )

477
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:26,233
- What happening here?
- I don't know.

478
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:30,433
Came in, set down his soup; then out
of the blue he starts screamin'!

479
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,300
He just went crazy!
Started smashing the place up.

480
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,700
- Did he say what he was mad about?
- No! He didn't say anything.

481
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,167
( Snarling )

482
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:42,033
Hey! Now, that's enough.

483
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:44,533
- ( Snarling )
- Stop!

484
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:46,933
- Iole, what are you doing?
- You're only scaring him.

485
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:52,267
Scaring him? He's gone crazy. He'll turn
this place into splinters if I don't stop him!

486
00:38:52,267 --> 00:38:55,167
No, please. Put the club down.
Let me talk to him.

487
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:59,500
Hercules! Put the club down.

488
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,067
It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you.

489
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:13,067
It's all right.

490
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:26,467
There, there. What's the matter?

491
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:28,900
( Whimpering )

492
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,933
I think he burned his mouth
on his food.

493
00:39:33,433 --> 00:39:36,133
He would have said something,
but he can't speak.

494
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:38,067
Can someone get him some water?

495
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:02,667
Not everything needs to be killed.

496
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,400
Sometimes kindness can work too.

497
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:29,033
- ( Gasps )
- Oh! Be careful.

498
00:40:29,033 --> 00:40:31,867
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Thanks.

499
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:39,267
IOLE: Come on.

500
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,500
IOLE: It's beautiful, isn't it?

501
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,700
Yeah. A lot of stars out tonight.

502
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,900
Myrea and Martumus.

503
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,300
Every time I see them,
it makes me sad.

504
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,500
- Which ones are they?
- Right up there.

505
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,100
- Right where?
- Right up there.

506
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,500
Here, I'll show you.

507
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,700
They were lovers once--
or would have been.

508
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,500
Their families were at war
and kept them apart.

509
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,900
They were never allowed
to see each other,

510
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,700
never allowed to touch.

511
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,300
- Why didn't they just run away?
- They were going to.

512
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:35,100
They had it all planned out. They were gonna
meet in the meadow and finally be together.

513
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,900
Myrea's father found out.
He was so enraged.

514
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:42,300
When Myrea refused to denounce
her love for Martumus.

515
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,900
He was so filled with spite
that he killed her.

516
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,300
- He killed his own daughter?
- Uh-huh.

517
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:52,300
He tossed her body into the heavens.
See? That's her, reaching out.

518
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,700
HERCULES:
And what happened to Martumus?

519
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,900
Well, he wnet down to the
meadow to wait for her.

520
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,300
Naturally, she never came.

521
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:04,300
And then, by chance, he looked up
into the sky, and there she was.

522
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:09,100
What did he do? Did he get revenge?
Did he kill her father?

523
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,500
No. He was so wracked with grief...

524
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,700
That he drew his dagger
and cut his own heart out.

525
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,100
He had to stop the pain.

526
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,900
Luckily, the gods saw what happened.

527
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,100
Out of pity, they drew his body
up into the heavens.

528
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:30,300
See? That's him, reaching out
towards Myrea.

529
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,900
HERCULES: But they're not touching.

530
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,500
No.

531
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,300
In a cruel twist of fate,

532
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,700
he landed just out of reach of her.

533
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,500
And that's how they'll spend eternity.

534
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:48,700
They know they'll never touch,
but they'll never stop trying.

535
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:52,300
It's sad, isn't it?

536
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,500
I guess I'm just silly.

537
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,900
Good night, Hercules.

538
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:17,100
Yeah. Uh, good night, Iole.

shouldn't be watching me.

- Iole!

543
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:56,100
You don't deserve to love,
you bastard!

544
00:44:58,733 --> 00:45:02,467
Whoa! Who are you, friend?
Why are you attacking me?

545
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:03,667
I'm not your friend!

546
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:07,900
Fine! But what's your name, kid?
I like to know who's tryin' to kill me.

547
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,800
I'm not a kid, either.

548
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,600
You're not, but I don't
remember crossing you.

549
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,600
Doesn't matter. You'll
remember dying by my hand!

550
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:24,367
Now, that's enough! I'm not
gonna dirty my fists on you.

551
00:45:24,367 --> 00:45:26,267
- You're not?
- No.

552
00:45:26,267 --> 00:45:28,200
You can go find someone else to kill.

- ( Spear Cracking )
- Now, I'm warning you.

554
00:45:31,567 --> 00:45:33,433
The next thing to break is your neck.

- ( Attacker Grunts )
- ( Weapon Cracking )

556
00:45:38,767 --> 00:45:40,667
Hercules, don't kill him!

557
00:45:48,667 --> 00:45:52,567
- Poor Lycastus!
- Is there something you want to tell me?

558
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:54,767
I told him not to follow me,
but he can't help it.

559
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:57,533
- He doesn't understand.
- Doesn't understand what?

560
00:45:57,533 --> 00:46:00,000
That even though I love him.
There isn't a future for us.

561
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,367
- Well, why not?
- There can't be. It's not in my destiny.

562
00:46:04,367 --> 00:46:07,833
But if you love him,
and he obviously loves you--

563
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:11,800
It doesn't matter. There are more
important things in the world.

564
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,767
My life and his life mean nothing.

565
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:17,267
I don't want this to affect
anything, Hercules.

566
00:46:17,767 --> 00:46:20,700
Saving my village is still the only
thing that matters to me.

567
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,200
Come on. Let's go.

568
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,700

570
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:52,933
We're close now. It's just up here.

571

There it is. It's even worse
than when I left it.

573
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:10,067

It's him!

575
00:47:17,767 --> 00:47:23,267
Iole's back, and she's
brought Hercules with her!

He's the strongest man in the world!

579
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,400
Come with us, Hercules.
We'll take you to it.

What is this thing?

591
00:49:54,567 --> 00:49:58,000
That's the Underworld. There's
nothing down there but death.

592
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,933
I need to know something.

593
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,333
Am I immortal or not?

594
00:50:05,733 --> 00:50:08,200
- Hercules--
- I've never asked you before.

595
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,400
But as your son. I'm asking you now.

596

Can I die?

597
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,733
- You don't wanna know.
- I have to know.

598

You're a god, my mother's mortal
what does that make me?

599
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:22,733
It's a question you should't
be asking.

600

But I have to know what will
happen if I go into that hole.

Will I ever get back hole again?

602
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:30,600
So don't go into the hole!
Go home right now.

603

You don't have to save this town!
You don't owe anything to these people!

604

Just turn around and leave!

605
00:50:37,933 --> 00:50:40,933
Go home and grow old with
your family like you intended to.

606

609
00:50:57,467 --> 00:50:59,567
you can die.

telling the truth?

- To keep me out of that hole.

happen to me.

I may never come back.

He put it on and it tortured him,

677
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,500
drove him mad.

678
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,433
( Panting ) His only escape...

679
00:56:39,433 --> 00:56:42,300
was to jump into the hole.

680
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,800
That cloak was supposed to
protect him.

681
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,567
It was supposed to protect us!

682
00:56:51,567 --> 00:56:54,067
( Sobs ) I've killed him.

00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,900
Answer me. I'm talk to you.

687
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,700
Oh, you're talking to me.
Of course you're talking to me.

688
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,700
Who else in Hades?
I'm the only one here.

689
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,500
Well, where is "Here"?

690
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,533
It is, uh, customary to pay
the Boatman for passage.

691
00:57:56,433 --> 00:57:59,900
Huh? Wait, what are you doin' here?

692
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:02,167
- You can't go across!
- Why not?

693
00:58:02,167 --> 00:58:06,100
Why not? Because you're still alive.
That's why not.

694
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:09,600
Only the dead are permitted
to cross the River Styx.

695
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,833
Well, we're gonna chance
that right now, aren't we?

696
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:15,667
No, no, no, no. We can't.

697
00:58:15,667 --> 00:58:19,800
- "Can't"?
- When I say "can't,"

698
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,800
I mean, you're a regular kind
of guy, I guess, uh--

699
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,700
We could, uh, maybe talk. Yeah. Okay.

700
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:30,133
BOATMAN: Hades is not gonna be
happy about this, let me tell you.

701
00:58:30,133 --> 00:58:32,633
No one alive has ever
entered the Underworld before.

702
00:58:33,133 --> 00:58:36,133
You're gonna be in bug trouble
when he hears about this.

703
00:58:36,133 --> 00:58:38,800
What am I sayin'?
I'm gonna be in big trouble.

704
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:44,133
I don't know why someone who's
alive would wanna come down here.

705
00:58:44,567 --> 00:58:47,300
Hey, what's the matter? Huh?
You lookin' for someone?

706
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,233
- Someone lookin' for you?
- ( Loud Growling )

707
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,667
- There goes another one.
- Another what? What was that?

708
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:56,700
Ah, the damn dog, Cerberus.

709
00:58:56,700 --> 00:59:02,700
He's supposed to guard the gate, keep
the dead down here where they belong.

710
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,900
But he's gotten loose somehow. Now he's
running around all over, causing trouble.

711
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,900
Aye, yay, yay, yay.

712
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:13,833
Can't imagine what it must
be like up in the living world.

713
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:17,267
Yeah. Well, I can.

714
00:59:20,267 --> 00:59:23,733
Uh, so, uh, how 'bout it?

715
00:59:23,733 --> 00:59:26,333
A little, uh, somethin' for the effort?

716
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:28,333
Sorry. Can't help you.

717
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:32,167
Hey. At least give me my lantern back.

718
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:35,667
Maybe a little later.
Thanks for the ride, though.

719
00:59:35,667 --> 00:59:39,667
Oh, yeah! That's great!
Very funny. A real comedian.

720

Do you have someone in mind?

- Friends?
- Sure. What else would we be?

- What's happened?

- Bring her inside.

- You're the one to blame.
- Actually, it was Hera's plan.

Poor Deianeira.

833
01:10:49,133 --> 01:10:52,433

has driven you to your death,

01:10:52,933 --> 01:10:55,433
she was so overcome with guilt,

835
01:10:55,433 --> 01:10:59,233
- she killed herself.
- No!

836
01:10:59,233 --> 01:11:03,600

01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,467
Excuse me.

852
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:35,700
Deianeira!

853
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:49,000
Deianeira.

854
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:52,500
I-I can't believe I found you.

855
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:55,933
I-- I'm sorry. A-am I
Supposed to know you?

856
01:12:55,933 --> 01:12:59,867
What do you mean? It's me! Hercules.

857
01:12:59,867 --> 01:13:01,367
I'm your husband.

858
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,700
I'm afraid I don't remember.

859
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:07,600
How can you not remember?

860
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,733
You have to remember.
We love each other.

861
01:13:12,133 --> 01:13:13,133
( Zapping Sound )

862
01:13:15,633 --> 01:13:18,833
Hercules. You shouldn't be here.

863
01:13:19,333 --> 01:13:23,333
Hades. What have you done to
my wife? She cann't remember me.

864
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:25,333
What's wrong with her?

865
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:30,833
Nothing's wrong. I've merely erased
the misery that brought her here that's all.

866
01:13:30,833 --> 01:13:36,100
I've give her peace. Now, you must
go. Your time hasn't come yet.

867
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:39,933
- But her time hasn't come either.
- I'm sorry, my friend, it has.

868
01:13:39,933 --> 01:13:42,933
I lifted her broken body
from the rocks myself.

869
01:13:42,933 --> 01:13:45,867
You made a mistake she's going
back to my world with me.

870
01:13:45,867 --> 01:13:48,700
( Laughs ) That's impossible.

871
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,033
- Nothing's impossible.
- ( Cerberus Growling )

872
01:13:53,033 --> 01:13:54,533
Damn it!

873
01:13:55,033 --> 01:13:59,467
Look, um. I really would go
to debate this.

874
01:13:59,467 --> 01:14:00,967
But you've chosen a bad time.

875
01:14:00,967 --> 01:14:03,933
I've got a lot to worry about. Okay?

876
01:14:03,933 --> 01:14:07,767
- You really should go back to the land
of the living.   - No. Without Deianeira.

877
01:14:07,767 --> 01:14:10,700
HADES: But she's happy here.
This is a magnificent place!

878
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:15,100
Look around you. There's
nothing but beauty and goodness.

879
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,333
It's her reward. To take her
away now would be selfish.

880
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:23,833
And beside. Even if you could take her.

881
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:26,267
You can't restore her memory.

882
01:14:32,467 --> 01:14:35,900
Deianeira. You've got to try.

883
01:14:36,333 --> 01:14:38,833
Deep down, it's all there. Please.

884
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:41,833
Say you remember me.

885
01:14:43,333 --> 01:14:45,300
I'm sorry, but I can't.

886
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:48,700
Think about our home, about our children.

887
01:14:49,133 --> 01:14:52,633
- Our children?
- Yes. Aeson and Klonus.

888
01:14:52,633 --> 01:14:56,567
And little Ilea. You have to remember them.

889
01:14:58,567 --> 01:15:01,000
Ilea? I wish I could.

890
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,433
You can.

891
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:16,367
Hercules?

892
01:15:16,367 --> 01:15:20,367
Hercules. Oh, take me home.

893
01:15:20,367 --> 01:15:21,367
Take me home.

894
01:15:21,867 --> 01:15:25,767
Hercules. I'm very happy for
your little reunion.

895
01:15:25,767 --> 01:15:28,700
Really. But, uh, she still has to stay.

- A deal?

898
01:15:36,067 --> 01:15:38,567
Now, what could you possibly
have that I would want?

899
01:15:38,567 --> 01:15:41,067
Your Underworld's in chaos.

900
01:15:41,067 --> 01:15:43,033
If I'm not wrong, it's because
Cerberus is running loose.

901
01:15:43,033 --> 01:15:47,400
- Yes?
- I'll catch him and return him to is post...

902
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,833
if you agree to let Deianeira
return with me to the living.

903
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:54,700
My best Hunters are chasing that dog
and they haven't been able I capture him yet.

904
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:57,100
- What makes you think you can do it?
- I want a deal.

905
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,400
Will you allow Deianeira to leave
with me if I catch Cerberus?

( Cerberus Growling )

907
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:08,333
Fine. Fine. You return
Cerberus to his past,

908
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:11,567
and you and your wife may leave.

909
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,433
However, if you fail,

910
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:16,733
she's mine... forever.

911
01:16:19,733 --> 01:16:22,733
Don't worry. I'll come back for you.

912
01:16:25,667 --> 01:16:27,633
I won't leave you behind this time.

913

1022
01:26:56,233 --> 01:27:00,100
Just because you came back from the
Underworld doesn't ment you're an immortal.

1023
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,567
- Doesn't mean I'm not.
- True.

1024
01:27:02,567 --> 01:27:07,067
To tell you the truth, I don't think
I really care if I live forever.

1025
01:27:07,067 --> 01:27:10,067
Everything I need is right
here and now.

1026
01:27:10,067 --> 01:27:11,567
You've got a point.

1027
01:27:11,567 --> 01:27:15,067
I'm sure you feel the same way
if this were...

1028
01:27:15,567 --> 01:27:17,900
- My family.
- I heard that.

1029
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:21,967
- What are you talking about? This is
your family.   - Thank you, thank you.

1030
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:25,700
Grandfather, look. Look what I've got.

1031
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,700
- Oh! What is that?
- An apple.

1032
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:32,100
An apple, isn't that the nicest apple...

1033
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:33,967
You've ever seen?

1034
01:27:33,967 --> 01:27:36,500
- Want a bite? Come on.
- ( Laughs )

1035
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:39,200
- Hercules!
- ZEUS: Take a bite.

1036
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,933
Hercules!

1037
01:27:44,033 --> 01:27:45,633
We need you!

1038
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:47,400
