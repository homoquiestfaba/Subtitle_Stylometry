2
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:24,620
Yesterday, I had a dream.

3
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:29,612
I was in a climbing gym somewhere,
a run-down gym, totally shabby.

4
00:00:31,241 --> 00:00:36,637
Some climber walks in
wearing crampons and a helmet.

5
00:00:37,106 --> 00:00:40,147
Behind him I can see
a snowstorm raging.

6
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:43,621
I think,
"I'd love to climb the Torre now, too!"

7
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:47,140
So I open the door,
get crampons, an ice axe and stuff,

8
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,866
and suddenly I'm
right in the middle of the Ice Towers.

9
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:51,293
It was so weird!

10
00:00:52,363 --> 00:00:53,450
Cool dream.

11
00:00:54,556 --> 00:00:55,750
Weird.

12
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:23,026
It all began with the dream

13
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:28,433
to take part
in an expedition outside Europe.

14
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,756
From that moment on

15
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:34,262
the dream

16
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:36,973
became a nightmare.

17
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:02,373
A heavy snowstorm had frozen the wall.

18
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:04,917
My foot slipped.

19
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:09,383
I tried to hang on with my right hand,
but that slipped too.

20
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:36,115
As I was slipping, I managed
to grab hold with my left hand.

21
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:41,245
That was the most dangerous moment,
because I nearly fell off the mountain.

22
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:02,446
<i>Every story about Cerro Torre</i>

23
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,128

shrouding its first ascent --</i>

24
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:08,962
<i>a secret known only to
Cesare Maestri and Toni Egger.</i>

25
00:03:55,104 --> 00:04:00,116
If I could, I'd go back
and delete the mountain from my life.

28
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:51,959
The alleged ascent with Toni Egger,

29
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:55,296
if it actually took place, would be

30
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,048
the greatest ascent

31
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,133
of this mountain ever.

32
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,341
Cesare Maestri will
go down in the history

33
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:13,507
of mountaineering but also
in the history

34
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:16,743
of question marks.
Was he really up there?

35
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:24,314
Was he really the first
to climb Cerro Torre or not?

36
00:06:09,991 --> 00:06:13,958
There was doubt
about our first expedition.

37
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:20,218
We didn't want to leave
any uncertainty,

38
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:23,440
so we went back.

39
00:06:24,446 --> 00:06:26,472
<i>If Maestri wants to save face,</i>

40
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:29,314
<i>he'll have to attack the Torre
one more time.</i>

41
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:58,102
<i>He returns to the mountain
with 1.500 pounds of equipment.</i>

42
00:06:58,244 --> 00:07:01,574
<i>The centerpiece of his new strategy
is a massive piece of machinery --</i>

43
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,880
<i>a 180-pound
gas-powered compressor</i>

44
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:07,617
<i>designed to drive
a heavy-duty power drill.</i>

45
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:16,179
<i>Maestri will perforate the Torre's
raw granite walls with metal bolts.</i>

46
00:07:16,595 --> 00:07:19,686
<i>This time around,
he will leave nothing to chance.</i>

47
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:49,687
You want to do the first free ascent
of the 1970 Maestri route.

<font color="#ffcc00">Reinhold Messner

49
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:53,587
You don't need a film crew or a camera.

50
00:08:53,587 --> 00:08:57,301
Just do it,
and if you succeed, you succeed.

51
00:08:58,776 --> 00:09:03,201
This film that could come out
in two to three years

52
00:09:03,407 --> 00:09:06,972
is going to be totally
different on the big screen

53
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,919
from what you're doing now.

54
00:09:10,768 --> 00:09:14,126
We won't see you go there and fail,

55

adding bolts to mount cameras,
the helicopter flying in and out.

56
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:24,622
In the film we'll see you start at
the bottom and finish on the summit.

57
00:09:24,823 --> 00:09:30,052
Fantastic! We all applaud that,
but it has nothing to do with reality.

58
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,128
We did it! Yeah!

59
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:38,009
Don't you think that the film crew

60
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:43,993
or the guys from Red Bull are taking
advantage of you on Cerro Torre?

61
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:49,672
Reinhold, I think we have
a little misunderstanding here.

62
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:06,092
Reaching the top isn't so important.

63
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:07,954
It's just for fun.

64
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:36,788
It's a combination of things
that uniquely characterize him.

65
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:38,405
An Austrian mother,

66
00:10:38,407 --> 00:10:43,201
a Nepalese father, a Sherpa,
and Sherpas are renowned

67
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,290
for being very strong,

68
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:50,340
physically as well as mentally.

69
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,314
And this is all evident in David.

70
00:10:57,613 --> 00:11:02,894
I don't play soccer, because climbing
is quite different from playing soccer.

71
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:04,940
It's not a team sport.

72
00:11:31,788 --> 00:11:36,306
Heavy climbing under the heater,
that's his way of playing.

73
00:11:40,797 --> 00:11:44,162
I saw at once
that he has extraordinary talent.

74
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:48,867
He has a great sense of balance
and no fear whatsoever.

75
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:52,800
He moves really well on the rock.
Incredible.

76
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:17,911
We always thought it was in his genes.

77
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:21,625
"Himalayas and stuff.
That's where he got it."

78
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,023
But basically it's all in the head.

79
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:27,003
He doesn't care.
If he can't reach, he jumps.

80
00:12:27,801 --> 00:12:31,898
It's unique, because
no climber has ever won both titles,

81
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:35,682
- let alone at the age of 16.
- David Lama...

82
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:43,551
He's got it!
David Lama wins the world cup!

83
00:12:47,138 --> 00:12:51,209
- David Lama, ladies and gentlemen!
- He climbs everything on earth!

84
00:12:52,651 --> 00:12:55,643
The Austrian Spiderman: David Lama!

86
00:13:02,497 --> 00:13:05,170
Making him the youngest ever

87
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:11,243
The question I asked myself is:

88
00:13:11,347 --> 00:13:17,061
can I climb on the Cerro Torre
like I do in competition?

89
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:27,000
<font color="#ffcc00">In 2009 David Lama announced

92
00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:55,951
Many people say
it's impossible to free climb up there.

93
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:59,160
Maybe it's not possible for them,
but for me it is.

- Mark it.
- Use your hands.

100
00:15:01,571 --> 00:15:04,344

Puking and shitting.

115
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:31,456
<i>In the winter of 1970,
Maestri drilled some 300 holes,</i>

116

<i>along the southeastern ridge
for rope ladders.</i>

<i>he ignores Torre's

<i>and now chooses a straight line
to the top.</i>

120
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,318
During your first ascent in 1959

121
00:16:52,318 --> 00:16:56,313
there was no photographic documentation.
Do you have any now?

122
00:16:56,313 --> 00:16:58,204
The main documentation

123
00:16:58,204 --> 00:17:02,673
is the 70-kilo compressor
that remains just below the summit

124
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:06,401
as an eternal testimony

125
00:17:07,076 --> 00:17:11,598
to the ascent we accomplished.

126
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:19,150
This time no one can dispute
Maestri's great sporting achievement.

127
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,078
<i>This ascent
of the impossible mountain</i>

128
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:28,662
<i>would later go down in the books

<i>only a rope's length beneath

131
00:18:08,538 --> 00:18:11,485
<i>Alongside Maestri's bolt ladder,
we drill a new set of holes</i>

132
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:15,245
<i>to enable the filming David's free
ascent on the Compressor Route.</i>

133
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:18,667
<i>We are here to film --</i>

134
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,557
<i>The end justifies the means.</i>

135
00:18:54,923 --> 00:18:57,398
<i>Daniel is up and running again,
and the weather looks good.</i>

136
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:58,853
<i>We head back in.</i>

137
00:18:58,878 --> 00:19:02,944
<i>This time, we leave base camp behind us and
climb straight up to the Col de la Paciencia --</i>

138
00:19:02,968 --> 00:19:04,758
<i>the col of patience.</i>

139
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:25,028
- Hey, you know what would be cool now?
- What? - Kaiserschmarrn pancakes!

140
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:27,518
Kaiserschmarrn?

141
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:30,952
I can think
of lots of cool stuff right now.

142
00:19:34,511 --> 00:19:37,881
Yes, I think it'll work out tomorrow.

143
00:19:40,658 --> 00:19:42,828
So we can get up there on the summit.

144
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:46,749
- Good night, David.
- Night.

145
00:19:49,124 --> 00:19:50,775
Good night, Daniel.

146
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:53,628
Is that the Banana Crack?

147
00:19:55,157 --> 00:19:57,284
No idea. Shall we get the map out?

148
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:04,336
Our first attempt just didn't go well.

149
00:20:04,451 --> 00:20:08,955
I had to pull Daniel up. Then I had
the camera in my face all the time.

150
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:12,123
It's always there, it's irritating.

151
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:15,411
So, how's it going, David?

152
00:20:16,435 --> 00:20:20,364
Ask me again when I get down.
Right now I'm pissed off.

153
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,920
It's too hot now. I have to get down.

154
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:33,280
We have to get down now.

155
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,890
The ice is coming down all the time.

156
00:20:38,552 --> 00:20:41,792
Yeah... this is pretty crap.

157
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,797
Nothing went right.

158
00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:47,548
We only got to the Bolt Traverse.

159
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:52,295
Just when the climbing started
to get interesting, we had to turn back.

160
00:20:54,368 --> 00:20:59,481
It's doubtful whether we can make it
up this year. The walls are so iced up

161
00:20:59,481 --> 00:21:01,943
that our chances aren't good.

162
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,436
And once in the other direction. Quick!

163
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:31,032
When the weather isn't right,
you're just vegetating.

164
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:35,365
It hasn't been right for a month
and a half, so that's how long

165
00:21:35,365 --> 00:21:37,414
we've been killing time down here.

166
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,641
You drift on a raft,

167
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:57,450
but you don't paddle.

168
00:21:58,322 --> 00:22:01,454
Come on, let's have a barbecue.

169
00:22:10,003 --> 00:22:11,462
This song tells

170
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:17,464
the story of the ascent of Cerro Torre...

171
00:22:17,464 --> 00:22:19,220
<font color="#ffcc00">Toni Ponholzer
13th season in Patagonia</font>

172
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,999
up to where it is today.

173
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:26,633
The ascent of the original route
is still a mystery today.

174
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:32,261
We came here over the vast sea

175
00:22:32,261 --> 00:22:36,045
To the fight for the peaks of the world

176
00:22:36,776 --> 00:22:39,366
And the climbers move there

177
00:22:39,366 --> 00:22:41,615
With their gear

178
00:22:41,615 --> 00:22:45,325
To the goal that we set ourselves

179
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:51,972
Wild guanacos go with us

180
00:22:51,972 --> 00:22:56,049
Across the Pampas' lonely heights

181
00:22:56,602 --> 00:23:01,169
And from afar we can see

182
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:04,691
The Cerro Torre's distant peak

183
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:14,391
Mountain of our desires...

184
00:23:14,391 --> 00:23:17,640
Suddenly that climbing gym dude

185
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,851
wants to climb Cerro Torre.

186
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:23,314
One day you'll be ours!

187
00:23:23,314 --> 00:23:26,990
If the conditions are right
I can climb it really fast.

188
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:41,874
¿Qué hora es?

189
00:23:42,961 --> 00:23:44,904
What time is it?

190
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,465
<i>Time is up... Game over.</i>

191
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,419
<i>David Lama will not climb
the Compressor Route free,</i>

192
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:56,497
<i>and we have rigged the mountain for
a film shoot that never got under way.</i>

193
00:23:59,452 --> 00:24:02,697
Dirni thought he could
shoot the film in six weeks

194
00:24:02,697 --> 00:24:05,636
and head back home
with a complete film.

195
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,865
But it doesn't work like that.

196
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,037
<i>Instead of a historical
alpine adventure,</i>

197
00:24:11,062 --> 00:24:14,324
<i>we bring back home a
shit storm of epic proportions.</i>

198
00:24:19,211 --> 00:24:24,632
The things said on the Internet were
a justified attack on me as a climber.

199
00:24:29,982 --> 00:24:32,255
<font color="#ffcc00">DAVID, YOU RIDICULOUS CLOWN.</font>

200
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,740
I went to Patagonia all full of myself,

201
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,061
saying I could free climb the world's
hardest mountain just like that.

202
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:52,565
But if I hadn't been down there,
no film crew would have been there

203
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:54,913
and no bolts would've been placed.

204
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:59,006
In the end
I was the moron with the power drill,

205
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,769
just like the one 40 years ago.

206
00:25:29,175 --> 00:25:33,548
The first year I went down
with Daniel, a good friend of mine.

207
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:37,838
But then I realized
I need a top alpinist at my side.

208
00:25:37,954 --> 00:25:40,148
So I just called Peter.

209
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:43,165
I answered the phone and David said,

210
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:49,283
"Got time for a project, Peter?"
"Yeah, where?"

211
00:25:49,283 --> 00:25:52,995
"In the Tre Cime." "Cool, that's real
close. What are you planning?"

212
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:56,947
"Bellavista."
And I said, "An awesome project.

213
00:25:56,947 --> 00:25:59,317
I really want to be on board."

214
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,580
What I appreciate about Peter
when we're out climbing

215
00:26:10,838 --> 00:26:13,369
is not having to say much,
and he doesn't say things like:

216
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:18,603
"Look, there's a chamois."
I don't give a shit about chamois.

217
00:26:26,504 --> 00:26:29,790
We both live to climb,
and we get on really well.

218
00:26:29,992 --> 00:26:33,241
It worked well so I asked him

219
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:36,224
to come with me to Patagonia
the following year.

220
00:26:49,135 --> 00:26:53,128
So we're going back again.
But this time we agreed beforehand

221
00:26:54,251 --> 00:26:58,300
not to place any new bolts
and not to fix ropes.

222
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:02,891
The plan is that the film crew
will aid climb on Maestri's bolts

223
00:27:03,016 --> 00:27:05,774
like any other climbing party.

224
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:45,624
<font color="#ffcc00">Base camp</font>

225
00:27:46,441 --> 00:27:48,528
It's fogged up, the stupid thing.

226
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,796
- Better now?
- Yeah, it's okay.

227
00:27:56,658 --> 00:27:58,131
That's good.

228
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:04,338
Who cares! Tomorrow we're going up.

229
00:28:05,397 --> 00:28:08,217
I think it'll be okay for two days.
A two-day weather window

230
00:28:08,217 --> 00:28:11,443
can't just disappear within 12 hours.
That just won't happen.

231
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:22,469
The route I'd always planned
goes from the Col de la Paciencia

232
00:28:22,469 --> 00:28:25,520
along the southeast ridge to the summit.

233
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:28,372
At first it's easy,

234
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:31,901
past the Banana Crack
to the start of the Bolt Traverse.

235
00:28:32,205 --> 00:28:35,816
And where Maestri's bolt ladder
turns away to the right,

236
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:40,255
my free climb goes to the left
up the ridge, into the Ice Towers,

237
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:42,311
and up to the base of the Headwall.

238
00:28:44,084 --> 00:28:45,495
From the compressor,

239
00:28:45,495 --> 00:28:49,241
where Bridwell aid climbed straight up,

240
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:51,863
I'll have to find enough structures

241
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:53,327
to free climb it.

242
00:29:16,086 --> 00:29:18,177
David for Markus. Over.

243
00:29:19,238 --> 00:29:22,886
Down at base camp we'd
received a new weather report.

244
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,286
<font color="#ffcc00">Markus Pucher
film crew alpine guide</font>

245
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:28,975
But we couldn't reach the guys
up on the Col.

246
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,715
It's ten past two in the morning, David.

247
00:29:52,737 --> 00:29:55,113
I wonder
what the conditions will be like today.

248
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,439
For goodness' sake!
Pull on blue, please.

249
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,050
Okay.

250
00:30:34,461 --> 00:30:36,262
This really sucks!

251
00:30:37,176 --> 00:30:38,890
Is it worth it?

252
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:45,786
No, man...

253
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:48,023
Am I nuts?

254
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:58,532
- At least you feel the same as me!
- This is brutal.

255
00:31:04,982 --> 00:31:06,946
Awful conditions.

256
00:31:07,543 --> 00:31:09,474
Look at it. Incredible!

257
00:31:18,963 --> 00:31:21,614
<i>Overnight,
the weather has changed.</i>

258
00:31:22,571 --> 00:31:27,074
<i>Now the whole upper section is
covered with ice and is unclimbable.</i>

259
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:30,194
<i>The rest of the mountain hides
behind a thick curtain of fog.</i>

260
00:31:31,494 --> 00:31:34,559
<i>We circle around the Torre
several times,</i>

261
00:31:34,664 --> 00:31:36,809
<i>without a trace of David and Peter.</i>

262
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:52,407
Okay, Peter!

263
00:31:57,698 --> 00:31:59,654
This is shit!

264
00:32:07,034 --> 00:32:09,265
All the cracks were icy.

265
00:32:09,265 --> 00:32:13,817
And the ice kept
coming loose when the sun came out.

266
00:32:19,158 --> 00:32:22,262
I did know that to finish the project

267
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,542
I'd have to go beyond my limits.

268
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:33,443
But at the start I wasn't aware
how far beyond I'd have to go.

269
00:32:39,843 --> 00:32:42,478
Look how much ice there is.
That's really terrible.

270
00:32:55,524 --> 00:32:57,911
There's too much
of that stuff hanging overhead.

271
00:32:59,555 --> 00:33:02,179
We've no chance of reaching the summit.

272
00:33:04,178 --> 00:33:04,954
Yeah.

273
00:33:06,324 --> 00:33:08,839
Ten meters higher than last year.

274
00:33:09,442 --> 00:33:12,554
First ten meters further,
then ten meters below.

275
00:33:13,415 --> 00:33:16,037
And now in between.
It's a good start at least.

276
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:20,676
- Once we were 100 meters short.
- Yeah. - It's okay.

277
00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:23,751
At least we know
we're really going for it this year.

278
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:27,219
Because we have
a few tons of ice above us.

279
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:33,809
There's so much of it. Nobody
knows how well the ice actually holds.

280
00:33:34,964 --> 00:33:38,373
<i>New year, new partner,
same old story --</i>

281
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:40,522
<i>turning around
at the Bolt Traverse.</i>

282
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,770
Every pitch sucked.

283
00:33:47,688 --> 00:33:50,351
- Every single one.
- Even the easiest. - Yeah.

284
00:33:52,393 --> 00:33:56,562
If you come down here for a month
and a half just to do the Torre,

285
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:01,796
it'd drive everybody nuts.
That's just the way it is.

286
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:12,161
<i>Of all Patagonian summits,</i>

287
00:34:12,186 --> 00:34:16,023
<i>the Cerro Torre is the one
most exposed to the weather.</i>

288
00:34:16,594 --> 00:34:21,222

290
00:34:47,507 --> 00:34:49,757
Yeah, it's really shit again.

291
00:34:50,373 --> 00:34:54,583
It's really rough down here.
We've been here 20 days...

292
00:34:54,784 --> 00:34:55,898
Three weeks.

293
00:34:56,891 --> 00:34:58,463
And still nothing.

294
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:03,650
We'd need a really good weather window.

295
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:10,314
- No point in going up there again.
- None at all.

296
00:35:10,314 --> 00:35:12,006
We know that way by now.

297
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:16,047
I know it better
than the classics back home.

298
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:23,967
Maybe we can do something else
for the next two days.

299
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:29,110
What I really didn't want
was to hang around the village

300
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,980
and watch all the others

301
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,173
climb whichever peaks,

302
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:38,421
while we wait despairingly for
the weather to be right for the Torre.

<font color="#ffcc00">WEDNESDAY

- 22 and a half?
- Yeah. - Give or take.

22 and a half hours.

I'm so happy right now!

311
00:36:30,537 --> 00:36:32,150
Just sitting here.

312
00:36:35,044 --> 00:36:37,866

00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,639
Bouldering mat?

318
00:37:53,812 --> 00:37:56,014
I'm in David's bed!

319
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:01,479
- I tied you to the bed, Peter.
- I'm tied up? Am I crazy?

320
00:38:11,004 --> 00:38:13,636
What's the weather like, Peter?

321
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,066
Awesome weather.

322
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:25,122
- Really awesome.
- You fell out of bed last night.

323
00:38:25,312 --> 00:38:26,903
Really?

324
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:31,984
Then you were lying on the edge,

325
00:38:33,345 --> 00:38:35,906
so I thought I'd better tie you down.

326
00:38:38,163 --> 00:38:41,247
- Bullshit.
- No shit!

327
00:38:43,073 --> 00:38:44,670
Pure bullshit.

328
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:51,777
Get up, man!
I brought you the weather report.

329
00:39:21,471 --> 00:39:22,796
Wanna have a look?

330
00:39:31,233 --> 00:39:34,281
This is the window

331
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:38,120
that we climbed in,
but it's too late to head out now.

332
00:39:40,538 --> 00:39:42,231
It's too late now.

333
00:40:13,274 --> 00:40:16,333

us being stuck in El Chaltén.

334
00:40:19,432 --> 00:40:20,314
Yeah.

335
00:40:23,228 --> 00:40:25,224
Go climb something, locos!

336
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,984
- We have to get going now.
- Yep.

337
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:34,880
Let's go!

338
00:40:40,951 --> 00:40:44,684
<i>David and Peter
now have little time left.</i>

339
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,200
<i>Maybe the last chance</i>
<font color="#ffcc00">FRIDAY</font>

340
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,350
<i>to reach the summit this year.</i>
<font color="#ffcc00">SATURDAY</font>

341
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:58,746
<i>The film team stays behind.</i>

342
00:40:58,771 --> 00:41:02,142
<i>We have the helicopter and the
climbers have their two cameras.</i>

343
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,457
Hanging just below the compressor,
I got confused,

344
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:02,217
because I was a meter away,
and I thought,

345
00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:05,613
"What's happening now?"
Couldn't get any rope from below.

346
00:43:39,504 --> 00:43:42,375
It's strange when you have no anchor
above or below.

347
00:43:42,757 --> 00:43:46,658
- You know if someone falls...
- Falling's not an option. - No.

348
00:43:55,055 --> 00:43:57,838
With that ice thing over there,

349
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:03,332
you have to get a hold on the right
so the ice is between your feet.

350
00:44:03,948 --> 00:44:07,427
You know if any part breaks off,
it'll hit your partner head on.

351
00:44:33,196 --> 00:44:36,987
Climbing the Bridwell pitch from the
compressor onwards, that was really cool.

352
00:44:36,987 --> 00:44:41,923
We said, "Who's gonna climb
the Bridwell?" And you said, "Climb it."

353
00:44:48,626 --> 00:44:53,567
I have enough fuel for two more hours,
but at some point we'll run out of light.

354
00:44:54,621 --> 00:44:59,840
Okay, good. We'll... I reckon we'll reach
the summit in 30 to 45 minutes.

355
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,300
<font color="#ffcc00">BRIDWELL PITCH
final pitch below the summit</font>

356
00:45:34,784 --> 00:45:36,086
It's getting cold.

357
00:45:38,188 --> 00:45:39,458
But we'll manage.

358
00:45:53,132 --> 00:45:57,798
Peter is now four meters
from the summit plateau.

359
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:01,249
But everything is covered with ice.

360
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:03,727
And now we're screwed again.

361
00:46:04,836 --> 00:46:08,052
But I don't think we're giving up now.

362
00:46:16,343 --> 00:46:17,644
You bastard!

363
00:46:30,474 --> 00:46:32,804
I called the mountain all kinds of names.

364
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:37,640
- You can't turn back
four meters from the summit. - No.

365
00:46:38,398 --> 00:46:40,637
There's no turning back up there.

366
00:46:41,327 --> 00:46:44,195
It'd make you sick
for the rest of your life.

367
00:46:52,424 --> 00:46:54,285
Where are the guys, Tom?

368
00:46:54,890 --> 00:47:00,798
They're now at the top of the Headwall.
I have five minutes flying time left.

369
00:47:07,198 --> 00:47:10,828
At the compressor I put on the crampons,

370
00:47:10,837 --> 00:47:14,421
so I could run across
the last snowfield.

371
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,102
And I sprinted up there.

372
00:47:26,919 --> 00:47:29,743
I was so exhausted on the plateau.

373
00:47:30,209 --> 00:47:33,316
I had an aider hanging out on the left,

374
00:47:34,213 --> 00:47:37,980
and on the summit plateau
I thought, "Should I put it away?

375
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,298
No, keep going!
Stick the axe in, left, right."

376
00:48:27,303 --> 00:48:29,531
There were two little ice mushrooms.

377
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:34,564
I wasn't sure which was higher.
This one or that? That one!

378
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:38,471
Then up you go.
Yes, it's higher! Cool.

379
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:47,271
<font color="#ffcc00">Saturday
12th of February 2011 - 22:05</font>

380
00:49:04,201 --> 00:49:06,942
- We did it!
- Cool.

381
00:49:13,714 --> 00:49:16,730
The greatest moment was
standing on the summit,

382
00:49:18,504 --> 00:49:24,007
looking around and seeing
I am on top of the Torre.

383
00:49:24,344 --> 00:49:28,739
On the ice mushroom. The sun is setting,
Fitz Roy is disappearing in the dark.

384
00:49:29,653 --> 00:49:31,559
It was a terrific moment.

385
00:49:33,767 --> 00:49:36,558
One of the best
mountain moments I've ever had.

386
00:50:17,483 --> 00:50:20,795
That's it for today.
Now we just have to free climb this thing.

387
00:50:20,795 --> 00:50:22,704
Anything you want to add, Markus?

388
00:50:23,594 --> 00:50:25,566
Listen up, Peter!

389
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:28,484
Give the Torre my regards,

390
00:50:28,811 --> 00:50:32,454
and when you rappel down,
stay awake, alright?

391
00:50:33,422 --> 00:50:37,119
Yeah, will do. Good night. Ciao!

392
00:50:37,127 --> 00:50:39,987
All the best. Take care!

393
00:50:41,793 --> 00:50:46,493
I think in the first two years
the Torre wore me down so badly

394
00:50:46,915 --> 00:50:50,507
that when I stood on top
at the end of the second year

395
00:50:53,443 --> 00:50:58,131
I really didn't care
if I'd free climbed my way up

396
00:50:58,131 --> 00:51:00,441
or pulled myself up on the bolts,

397
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,999
because it was the first time I realized

398
00:51:07,692 --> 00:51:11,027
how hard it is
to reach the summit at all.

399
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,840
I think that was the moment

400
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:17,174
when I stopped being a sport climber
and became an alpinist.

403
00:51:26,484 --> 00:51:28,104
Watch out for the end of the rope!

404
00:51:36,504 --> 00:51:38,113
I can't see a thing.

405
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:15,810
I grew up as a sport climber and
as such the first thing you learn is:

406
00:52:15,928 --> 00:52:18,281
Never put your finger in a bolt.

407
00:52:18,281 --> 00:52:23,919
If you fall, it'll be cut off.
Just as I never questioned that rule,

408
00:52:24,363 --> 00:52:28,974
I never questioned the rules of
climbing competitions, which for years

409
00:52:28,974 --> 00:52:31,928
ruled my life in a way.
And so the first time

410
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:35,014
that I stood on top of the Torre,

411
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:40,301
I also realized for the very first time

412
00:52:40,301 --> 00:52:45,662
that I wasn't in a gym anymore and
the Torre isn't a competition venue

413
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,477
with 1000 spectators, and a referee

414
00:52:48,477 --> 00:52:52,295
with a stopwatch.
There's no one watching you.

415
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:55,722
You're on your own,
at best with your partner.

416
00:52:55,722 --> 00:53:00,341
Therefore there are no rules,
and it's your attitude that's decisive.

417
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,957
<i>Climbing is way more
than just sports.</i>

418
00:54:43,337 --> 00:54:47,198
<i>It's all about the thrill,
the experience, the whole nine yards.</i>

419
00:55:25,636 --> 00:55:28,903
If David manages to free climb up there,

420
00:55:30,445 --> 00:55:32,145
then...

421
00:55:34,301 --> 00:55:39,553
he'll have shown everyone
how it's done, and that it can be done.

424
00:55:50,644 --> 00:55:52,087
I think we've got it.

425
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:54,488
What did he say?

426
00:55:55,499 --> 00:55:57,673
Charly said, on the 19th.

427
00:55:59,752 --> 00:56:02,060
The 19th is Thursday.

428
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,648
Today's the 15th.

429
00:56:49,547 --> 00:56:52,508
- So you're going up there
the day after tomorrow? - Right.

430
00:56:52,508 --> 00:56:56,694
- And you go up tomorrow? - We go up
tomorrow, and the day after that

431
00:56:57,075 --> 00:56:59,732
we could already get to the shoulder.

my father taught me

437
00:57:44,885 --> 00:57:47,614
I'd spent some time
in the Bridwell camp.

438
00:57:47,624 --> 00:57:51,448
We were sitting by the huts
and lying around in the sun, you know?

439
00:57:51,788 --> 00:57:54,415
Rice, pasta, potatoes...

440
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:56,845
It was the same every day!

441
00:57:56,978 --> 00:58:01,958
We hadn't had
meat for ages. So we thought,

442
00:58:01,958 --> 00:58:06,452
"We could eat these mice.
They live off grass and healthy stuff."

443
00:58:06,585 --> 00:58:10,164
So we gutted them like a butcher would.

444
00:58:10,164 --> 00:58:14,992
Then we salted them
and threw them into the frying pan.

445
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:17,863
Six mice, very tender, very nice!

446
00:58:19,553 --> 00:58:22,878
Someone called, I didn't recognize
the number so I picked up.

447
00:58:22,997 --> 00:58:24,667
I called up Markus...

448
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:30,163
"Are you Markus?"
"Yeah, sure, but which Toni are you?"

449
00:58:30,163 --> 00:58:33,563
I was looking for a partner
for Cerro Torre's north face.

450
00:58:33,748 --> 00:58:36,931
It's obvious why. Who is going?

451
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,821
I showed him some photographs
and he got excited.

452
00:58:39,821 --> 00:58:45,238
This is Toni Egger's route.
Straight up Cerro Torre's north face.

453
00:58:45,452 --> 00:58:47,465
Everybody knows Toni Ponholzer.

454
00:58:47,465 --> 00:58:52,465
He's been going to Cerro Torre for
years. He's a real Cerro Torre veteran.

455
00:58:52,465 --> 00:58:57,598
With Toni there are
three of us now. Lincoln Else,

456
00:58:58,165 --> 00:59:00,647
Toni Ponholzer and me.

457
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:07,278
What drives me to climb the north face

458
00:59:08,402 --> 00:59:11,387
is that I keep thinking of Toni Egger.

459
00:59:13,172 --> 00:59:14,997
He's no longer alive.

460
00:59:15,413 --> 00:59:19,714
He can no longer tell the world
if he got to the summit or not.

461
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:26,331
I want to take his route,

462
00:59:26,684 --> 00:59:32,037
and either finish it for him
or repeat it, so there's finally someone

463
00:59:32,793 --> 00:59:36,313
who can speak up for him,
"The route can be climbed.

464
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:38,106
Let me find my peace!"

465
00:59:59,267 --> 01:00:01,265
The container isn't big.

466
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:06,377
It has four beds, a bathroom in the
back and a common room with a kitchen.

467
01:00:10,653 --> 01:00:13,609
How gross! Two or three flies, huh!

468
01:00:14,501 --> 01:00:18,846
- Peter, let's set a new world record.
- You can live quite well.

469
01:00:18,846 --> 01:00:22,178
Real luxury for a mountaineer.

470
01:00:22,864 --> 01:00:26,797
No more tent. You have a container,
which sounds kind of strange,

471
01:00:27,139 --> 01:00:30,789
but that's a luxury for us.

472
01:00:35,879 --> 01:00:37,204
Okay, that's it.

473
01:00:39,153 --> 01:00:44,114
Having a dry room
with electricity and hot water

474
01:00:44,889 --> 01:00:49,354
where you can stay...
It's simple, but it's okay.

477
01:01:08,213 --> 01:01:11,406
You bet.
There's nothing before Wednesday?

478
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:16,294
No.

479
01:01:18,705 --> 01:01:23,244
No, I really don't think
it'd be smart to...

480
01:01:23,645 --> 01:01:26,219
- Do anything before then.
- To do anything before then.

481
01:01:28,797 --> 01:01:32,401
Don't you think? Rationally speaking?

482
01:01:35,462 --> 01:01:39,105
It just sucks that
the weather's great for mountaineering.

483
01:01:39,934 --> 01:01:43,480
Not perfect for the Torre in fact,
but great for mountaineering.

484
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:47,260
We'll do the Torre on the 21st,

485
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:53,140
Exupery on the 22nd
and Fitz on the 23rd.

486
01:01:54,633 --> 01:01:58,787
We'd better do something at all.
We've had a good week

487
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:03,353
of reasonable weather.
That's what's so crap,

488
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:05,377
that really pisses me off.

489
01:02:07,332 --> 01:02:11,244
I'm really sorry,
but we came here for the Torre.

did Maestri curse the mountain?

492
01:04:05,393 --> 01:04:08,019
Put a Macumba spell on it?

493
01:04:10,303 --> 01:04:13,361
We sent a unit round right away.

494

01:05:06,991 --> 01:05:12,952
You have to know
how to put your mistakes aside

498
01:05:12,952 --> 01:05:15,581
and choose another way.

499
01:05:25,952 --> 01:05:31,000
<font color="#ffcc00">WEDNESDAY
El Chaltén</font>

500
01:05:31,388 --> 01:05:32,574
David?

501
01:05:36,007 --> 01:05:38,522
- I'm afraid we have to wake you up.
- Because?

502
01:05:38,708 --> 01:05:42,052
- We have some news.
- Which is...

503
01:05:43,133 --> 01:05:46,731
Here's what happened.
Markus Pucher gave me a call.

504
01:05:48,078 --> 01:05:51,741
A Canadian climbing team came down,

505
01:05:53,746 --> 01:05:57,598
and apparently they aid climbed
the Compressor Route

506
01:05:57,598 --> 01:06:00,074
- but without using Maestri's bolts.
- Yeah.

507
01:06:00,935 --> 01:06:02,158
And...

508
01:06:03,027 --> 01:06:07,333
they removed all Maestri bolts
in the Headwall.

509
01:06:11,147 --> 01:06:12,638
Who cares?

510
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,063
No, I really don't care.
Then I won't use them either.

511
01:06:18,938 --> 01:06:23,696
- Why did they do that?
- They thought they had to.

512
01:06:24,224 --> 01:06:25,561
Just like I think

513
01:06:25,561 --> 01:06:30,225
I have to free climb
the Compressor Route, basically.

514
01:06:32,423 --> 01:06:34,364
<i>What David doesn't consider,</i>

515
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:37,167
<i>without the help of Maestri's bolts,
there is no way for the film team</i>

516
01:06:37,191 --> 01:06:39,598
<i>to cover his climb on the Headwall...</i>

517
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:44,265
<i>...Except...</i>

518
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:59,553
<i>The film crew's new plan is
to choose a different route --</i>

519
01:07:00,048 --> 01:07:05,424
<i>The line of the Torre's
uncontested first ascent in 1974.</i>

520
01:07:09,219 --> 01:07:10,697
<i>It was Casimiro Ferrari</i>

521
01:07:10,722 --> 01:07:14,353
<i>who discovered
the Torre's true soft spot --</i>

522
01:07:14,378 --> 01:07:16,366
<i>the iced-up west face.</i>

523
01:07:30,923 --> 01:07:36,201
The Ragni di Lecco expedition went down
in history for making the first ascent

524
01:07:36,201 --> 01:07:38,809
of Cerro Torre via the west face.

525
01:07:58,948 --> 01:08:01,956
<i>And Markus Pucher
is just the right guy</i>

526
01:08:02,128 --> 01:08:06,398
<i>to lead the film team safely
to the top within 48 hours.</i>

527
01:08:06,485 --> 01:08:10,403
It'll be amazing if we succeed,
and both teams get to the summit.

528
01:08:10,403 --> 01:08:15,052
We'll meet on top and film the guys.

529
01:08:16,157 --> 01:08:19,689
We'll go up on Friday
past the Bolt Traverse.

530
01:08:19,689 --> 01:08:21,787
- Yeah?
- We'll bivouac there

531
01:08:21,787 --> 01:08:25,142
- and go up on Saturday.
- Okay, good.

532
01:08:25,429 --> 01:08:28,813
We'll go up from the back on Friday
and bivy up there.

533
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,023
We'll show them,
they think we aren't doing anything.

534
01:08:33,023 --> 01:08:34,368
- Really?
- You bet.

535
01:08:45,946 --> 01:08:48,694
Your rope... good. Ice screws...

536
01:08:48,694 --> 01:08:50,220
<font color="#ffcc00">THURSDAY
El Chaltén</font>

537
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:53,714
We'll leave some stuff behind,
so we're a bit lighter.

538
01:08:53,899 --> 01:08:56,005
Hey, the weather is so cool.

539
01:08:56,622 --> 01:09:00,752
So this is it. What we've
been waiting for for three years.

540
01:09:00,752 --> 01:09:03,457
It's so cool. I can hardly believe it.

541
01:09:09,049 --> 01:09:12,564
- Markus. - David? - See you up there.
- See you up there.

542
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:15,682
Okay, Markus,

543
01:09:15,682 --> 01:09:18,787
- have fun on the west side.
- You too.

544
01:09:19,162 --> 01:09:23,343
I'll think of you
as I ax my way up through the ice.

545
01:09:23,343 --> 01:09:28,219
- West face, east face, right?
- Exactly. - Great. Cool.

546
01:09:29,255 --> 01:09:31,337
- Okay, ciao.
- Ciao.

547
01:09:48,086 --> 01:09:52,510
- We've never seen the mountain like that.
- With so little ice? No.

548
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:58,254
The Headwall is so clean.

549
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,290
Okay, David, let's do it!

550
01:10:05,292 --> 01:10:06,529
You bet.

551
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:08,858
Alright.

552
01:10:09,276 --> 01:10:12,308
- Fingers crossed.
- If you ever let us go.

553
01:10:13,207 --> 01:10:15,433
It's your turn now. It's all yours!

554
01:10:15,693 --> 01:10:18,533
Once Peter and I
had crossed the hanging bridge

555
01:10:18,924 --> 01:10:24,168
and set off towards the Torre,
we knew this was our chance,

556
01:10:24,168 --> 01:10:30,019
one we had to take, one we wouldn't
get again for the next five years.

557
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:57,100
<font color="#ffcc00">BASE CAMP</font>

558
01:10:59,534 --> 01:11:05,309
- Right now it's... - Three hours.
- Quarter to ten. No, quarter to eleven.

559
01:11:06,468 --> 01:11:08,043
A three hour break.

560
01:11:15,010 --> 01:11:18,312
- I'll put my gloves on tomorrow morning.
- Really? - Yeah.

561
01:11:18,379 --> 01:11:21,083
- For the start.
- Not me. - It's good to start with.

562
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:23,275
- No, I don't like it.
- I do. - No.

563
01:11:25,922 --> 01:11:27,706
Like an old married couple!

564
01:11:31,703 --> 01:11:34,371
We came up really quickly today.
<font color="#ffcc00">FRIDAY
before sunrise</font>

565
01:11:34,371 --> 01:11:35,932
Yes, it went really great.
<font color="#ffcc00">FRIDAY
before sunrise</font>

566
01:11:35,932 --> 01:11:38,630
It didn't take us more than 90 minutes.

567
01:11:39,367 --> 01:11:42,000
- No, it didn't.
- Probably less.

568
01:11:42,306 --> 01:11:47,199
Now we'll put on all the gear
and on we go!

569
01:11:55,642 --> 01:12:00,540
Now we twiddle our thumbs. We have to
wait for six hours to stay on schedule.

570
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:01,968
We were way too quick.

571
01:12:03,088 --> 01:12:05,588
4.5 hours to the shoulder is great.

572
01:12:33,602 --> 01:12:37,556
<i>The helicopter drops off
the film team behind the Torre,</i>

573
01:12:38,243 --> 01:12:40,349
<i>at the foot of the west face.</i>

574
01:12:58,352 --> 01:13:02,442
It looks tough.
It's challenging, steep, covered with ice

575
01:13:02,442 --> 01:13:06,265
and mixed terrain in between.
If you're not familiar with it,

576
01:13:06,265 --> 01:13:08,823
if you're a rock climber,

577
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:11,779
then it's very daunting.

578
01:13:14,562 --> 01:13:20,700
We actually set off with a camera man
who knew nothing about ice climbing.

579
01:13:54,642 --> 01:13:58,103
<i>Meanwhile, David and Peter
have reached the Bolt Traverse</i>

580
01:13:58,307 --> 01:13:59,898
<i>under prime conditions.</i>

581
01:14:00,108 --> 01:14:02,416
You want an extra-romantic panorama pan?

582
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:05,491
An incredible panorama pan.

583
01:14:05,684 --> 01:14:07,924
- I'll start with you, okay?
- Okay.

584
01:14:08,226 --> 01:14:12,086
But then in this direction,
so you can see Loch Ness.

585
01:14:12,086 --> 01:14:13,697
- Alright.
- Okay.

586
01:14:16,687 --> 01:14:18,070
Ooooh. This is so beautiful.

587
01:14:19,684 --> 01:14:23,120
Here is Fitz Roy and Poincenot.

588
01:14:24,099 --> 01:14:25,961
And Little Raphael.

589
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:33,863
And over there is Loch Ness.

590
01:15:02,851 --> 01:15:04,238
The Bolt Traverse.

591
01:15:06,273 --> 01:15:09,176
The first pitch that
no one's free climbed yet, right?

592
01:15:09,946 --> 01:15:11,682
- Till now.
- Yeah.

593
01:15:14,236 --> 01:15:16,729
That'll have changed in 30 minutes.

594
01:15:17,161 --> 01:15:18,375
Let's hope so.

595
01:15:28,567 --> 01:15:30,491
The first chalk on the Torre.

596
01:15:34,115 --> 01:15:36,254
- Okay, Peter?
- Okay.

597
01:15:36,254 --> 01:15:39,852
The first pitch on the Bolt Traverse
is extremely difficult.

598
01:15:39,852 --> 01:15:43,229
You have to keep
your weight over your feet.

599
01:15:44,136 --> 01:15:46,177
You stand on very small footholds

600
01:15:46,177 --> 01:15:49,069
and you have really bad holds
for the hands.

601
01:15:50,113 --> 01:15:54,627
That makes it all really difficult.
You have to climb very precisely.

602
01:16:01,175 --> 01:16:02,636
Terrific, David.

603
01:16:02,636 --> 01:16:05,962
- How's it going?
- Good!

604
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:22,359
While on the Bolt Traverse,
climbing around the edge, I looked up.

605
01:16:22,522 --> 01:16:27,338
I saw this thin crack.
From the way it ran up,

606
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:28,816
becoming so narrow

607
01:16:28,816 --> 01:16:34,432
you couldn't even get your fingers in,
it became clear to me

608
01:16:34,432 --> 01:16:36,684
I would really have to dig deep.

609
01:16:55,247 --> 01:16:56,984
It's pretty difficult here.

610
01:16:57,820 --> 01:16:58,955
Okay.

611
01:17:09,974 --> 01:17:14,708
David climbed really well
until he got to the difficult bit.

612
01:17:18,907 --> 01:17:23,728
I could see it would get even tougher,
but he didn't say anything.

613
01:17:23,728 --> 01:17:27,826
But you could see from his moves
that this was a major challenge.

614
01:17:39,177 --> 01:17:41,881
Come on. I got you.

615
01:17:45,967 --> 01:17:47,212
It's okay!

616
01:17:55,943 --> 01:17:57,644
Damn tough here!

617
01:18:00,358 --> 01:18:02,263
Afterwards I thought,

618
01:18:04,124 --> 01:18:07,148
"I don't really get the feeling
this is possible."

619
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:16,899
It's no use. Let me down, Peter.

620
01:18:21,274 --> 01:18:24,826
You only get the chance to free climb
the Torre about every five years,

621
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:28,730
because the weather's rarely right.
You can't keep messing about

622
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:33,078
trying to free climb one pitch.
You have to get through it quickly.

623
01:18:47,988 --> 01:18:50,060
I can imagine that the crucial point

624
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:55,349
is the variation of the Bolt Traverse,
not, as others say,

625
01:18:55,349 --> 01:18:57,052
up in the Headwall.

626
01:19:16,095 --> 01:19:19,957
The last stretch was a vertical wall.

627
01:19:20,144 --> 01:19:23,075
There was water running down,
ice falling off...

628
01:19:23,075 --> 01:19:26,151
Markus and I looked at it... Jesus!

629
01:19:26,675 --> 01:19:29,045
How are we ever going to get up there?

630
01:19:35,564 --> 01:19:41,270
If you want to free climb the Torre,
you must go at it with all guns blazing.

631
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:44,228
Okay, Peter.

632
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:51,335
That's it, David!

633
01:20:59,922 --> 01:21:01,198
Keep going.

634
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,455
Keep going!

635
01:21:17,846 --> 01:21:18,967
Come on.

636
01:21:22,336 --> 01:21:24,417
It's okay, David! Sock it to him!

637
01:21:25,278 --> 01:21:26,763
Keep going!

638
01:21:30,670 --> 01:21:33,835
- Yeah, terrific!
- Yes!

639
01:21:36,362 --> 01:21:37,680
Yes, cool!

640
01:21:40,431 --> 01:21:42,589
I'll go round to the anchor, okay?

641
01:21:47,989 --> 01:21:51,540
Hello, Markus, what's your plan?
How's it going with you?

642
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:54,325
It's going well. We're at

643
01:21:54,325 --> 01:21:57,681
the first ice mushroom.
We're going up there now.

644
01:22:32,767 --> 01:22:34,435
I got to the top.

645
01:22:35,001 --> 01:22:38,394
I was all alone.
The two guys were still down below.

646
01:22:38,394 --> 01:22:43,662
I saw the sun go down,
and my eyes welled up. It was incredible.

647
01:22:44,233 --> 01:22:47,509
There's nothing you can do.
You're up there, and suddenly

648
01:22:48,062 --> 01:22:52,674
it just moves you to tears.
It's amazing.

649
01:23:13,426 --> 01:23:17,499
Peter, David, if you can hear me, we'll
make one more approach then fly home.

650
01:23:17,499 --> 01:23:20,857
See you tomorrow
with the latest weather report.

651
01:23:21,206 --> 01:23:23,534
Guys, have a great night and,

652
01:23:24,363 --> 01:23:26,881
yeah, have a blast!

653
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:38,571
Now we're ready for the night.

654
01:23:40,036 --> 01:23:41,735
In our sleeping bags,

655
01:23:42,962 --> 01:23:44,883
a nice sitting bivy.

656
01:23:46,046 --> 01:23:48,507
Enjoying the sunset.

657
01:23:53,618 --> 01:23:57,168
The place where they bivouacked
looked really uncomfortable.

658
01:23:57,168 --> 01:24:01,404
I kept thinking of them.
I'm sure it was a rough night.

659
01:24:01,804 --> 01:24:06,354
<font color="#ffcc00">film crew
arriving at summit plateau</font>

660
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:13,712
I was thinking back over the last
20 years I've been here in Patagonia.

661
01:24:14,712 --> 01:24:16,247
I thought, "Okay,

662
01:24:16,999 --> 01:24:19,411
I didn't come up the north face,

663
01:24:20,063 --> 01:24:22,754
but I really am where I wanted to be."

664
01:24:40,487 --> 01:24:41,905
It's really great.

665
01:24:42,437 --> 01:24:44,221
This is the only flag I have.

666
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,100
<font color="#ffcc00">SATURDAY
21st of January 2012</font>

667
01:26:36,433 --> 01:26:39,121
When you're pushed to your limits,

668
01:26:39,247 --> 01:26:42,058
it's more likely to stay in your memory

669
01:26:42,058 --> 01:26:44,922
than if you go jogging
on a treadmill somewhere every day.

670
01:26:46,494 --> 01:26:51,032
Then you can't just pick a moment
from your life and say,

671
01:26:51,227 --> 01:26:54,488
"Wow!
I really pushed myself to the limit."

672
01:27:08,467 --> 01:27:13,326
It's all loose flakes
and loose blocks, and...

673
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:15,579
you can't afford to make a mistake.

674
01:27:58,521 --> 01:28:00,548
That's something else.

675
01:28:13,009 --> 01:28:17,720
- Now we're up at the compressor.
- There it is, two or three meters away.

676
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:21,101
There it hangs.

677
01:28:21,918 --> 01:28:25,226
- Just one more pitch. Thirty meters.
- Not bad.

678
01:28:25,226 --> 01:28:27,526
Then we've redpointed the Torre.

679
01:29:02,306 --> 01:29:04,381
This is going to be tough, Peter.

680
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:29,215
These flakes are unstable.
They're loose and hollow. You never know,

681
01:29:29,215 --> 01:29:34,179
if you fall off with one, it might pull
out the next one and the next one.

682
01:29:34,179 --> 01:29:38,122
It could hit you from above
or cut the rope or whatever.

683
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:05,833
I think Peter saw the long runouts
between the placements there were,

684
01:30:06,384 --> 01:30:08,894
and he could well have been scared.

685
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:36,598
When I was 5 meters
from the summit snow-field, not knowing

686
01:31:36,598 --> 01:31:41,818
whether to go left across the slabs
or right onto the loose block,

687
01:31:42,176 --> 01:31:45,280
and I felt how terribly wobbly it was,

688
01:31:45,662 --> 01:31:49,824
that's when I thought,
"OK, you just have to hold now."

689
01:33:31,053 --> 01:33:32,563
Yes, Peter!

690
01:33:35,162 --> 01:33:36,785
Yes, sir!

691
01:34:16,634 --> 01:34:20,486
You only want to have climbed
something like that once in your life.

692
01:34:35,274 --> 01:34:36,398
Cool.

693
01:34:42,614 --> 01:34:45,772
- Thanks, Peter.
- Terrific, David.

694
01:34:48,779 --> 01:34:52,341
I believe that the skills
I brought from competition

695
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:56,700
were the final building block
in free climbing the Torre.

696
01:34:56,978 --> 01:34:58,366
Hey, guys!

697
01:34:58,715 --> 01:35:02,728
During my first two years
I lacked the alpine basis

698
01:35:02,728 --> 01:35:06,143
that I needed in order to
put the final building block in place.

699
01:35:11,122 --> 01:35:14,072
I'm really happy for you, guys. Yeah!

700
01:35:15,746 --> 01:35:17,448
We're still going up there, right?

701
01:35:18,666 --> 01:35:21,827
The reason I chose the Torre was

702
01:35:22,205 --> 01:35:28,131
that I was looking for something
where I could learn, and where...

703
01:35:28,704 --> 01:35:32,477
I could get involved
in something I wasn't part of at first,

704
01:35:34,823 --> 01:35:38,598
where I could learn a lot

705
01:35:38,598 --> 01:35:41,053
and discover so much about myself.

706
01:36:05,935 --> 01:36:10,612
It was cool standing up there
with Toni, Markus and Lincoln.

707
01:36:10,844 --> 01:36:13,179
They're really cool guys.

708
01:36:13,618 --> 01:36:18,658
Standing up there with such cool guys
isn't something you can take for granted.

709
01:36:24,851 --> 01:36:28,475
It's really cool,
the five of us standing up there.

710
01:36:28,475 --> 01:36:31,853
But it wouldn't have mattered
if there had been ten of us.

711
01:36:31,975 --> 01:36:34,895
Everyone had given
their all to be up there.

712
01:36:34,895 --> 01:36:36,938
And everyone shared the same joy.

713
01:36:40,959 --> 01:36:42,590
Actually that's the summit.

714
01:36:43,973 --> 01:36:45,762
I gotta do this now.

715
01:36:59,411 --> 01:37:02,789
I think everyone wants
to try and do their best

716
01:37:02,970 --> 01:37:05,343
and maybe set new standards.

717
01:37:05,697 --> 01:37:08,435
But what it's all about
is what you experience as you try.

718
01:37:32,686 --> 01:37:38,121
- What a cool mountain to ski down!
- Just what I thought while climbing up.

719
01:37:53,454 --> 01:37:55,513
Okay, Peter. I'm going down here!

720
01:37:56,946 --> 01:37:58,680
Right, David, have fun.

721
01:38:26,132 --> 01:38:28,218
Keep on shooting,
I'm not that picky.

722
01:38:28,218 --> 01:38:31,712
- In the edit...
- You throw it away.

723
01:38:31,712 --> 01:38:33,311
And snow!

724
01:38:33,661 --> 01:38:36,976
Hit Toni with the snow!
And more!

725
01:38:37,487 --> 01:38:38,572
Even more!

726
01:38:39,097 --> 01:38:42,191
Yeah, right!
And some fog!

727
01:38:43,498 --> 01:38:46,711
- And cut!
- Dirnhofer, piss off!

728
01:38:48,066 --> 01:38:52,833
Then
this really big chunk

729
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:54,524
hits his head.

730
01:38:59,345 --> 01:39:02,278
He had a tear
in his lip this size.

731
01:39:02,278 --> 01:39:03,574
So I say to him...

732
01:39:20,832 --> 01:39:22,687
Hey, guys, are you ready

733
01:39:22,858 --> 01:39:25,420
for another day
in wonderful Patagonia?

734
01:39:32,824 --> 01:39:34,562
First you do your stuff,

735
01:39:34,989 --> 01:39:37,483
then we'll climb
the north face!

736
01:39:37,845 --> 01:39:39,989
It's quite a steep pitch.

737
01:39:40,444 --> 01:39:43,733
- But you climbed it, right?
- Sure we did!

738
01:39:43,733 --> 01:39:45,720
Or did you go up
in the chopper?

739
01:39:46,169 --> 01:39:48,705
- No, we went up from
the glacier. - I see!

740
01:39:48,705 --> 01:39:50,235
What did you think?

741
01:39:56,754 --> 01:39:59,083
You only go up in a chopper now?

742
01:39:59,083 --> 01:40:01,479
From the age of 50, yeah.

743
01:40:02,689 --> 01:40:04,565
Chopper and jet plane.

744
01:40:42,710 --> 01:40:45,844
No, we don't really have
a special climbing style.

745
01:40:48,185 --> 01:40:50,781
We just go for it. Full throttle.
That's our style.

746
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:53,686
Let's play a proper game!
