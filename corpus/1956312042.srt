1
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,216
All right. We're here
to blather about the movie.

2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,845
This is Jen Nelson,
the director of <i>The Darkest Minds.</i>

3
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:12,763
And Dan Levine, producer.

4
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:14,849
And Dan Cohen,
executive producer.

5
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:17,369
- Wow. This is...
- That's the logo.

6
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:19,163
This is probably the first time
we've watched the movie

7
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:20,313
in a little while, right?

8
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:22,773
- I think we got to re-up our...
- Several months.

9
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,657
- Re-up our hard drives.
- I hear good things.

10
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:29,947
Well, this was really
about two years...

11
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:32,992
This was really about two years of us
trying to figure out

12
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:34,785
how to make this movie, right?

13
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:38,748
Yeah, to get the script right
and how to make it feel different

14
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:42,210
from the other sort of
YA dystopian movies out there.

15
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,296
Yeah, because when I first
met you guys, it was two years ago...

16
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,524
- Yeah.
- Almost to the day, pretty much.

17
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,692
- Yeah.
- Was it really?

18
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:50,110
- Yeah.
- You checked your diary?

19
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,334
- I think so. It's on my calendar.
- Nice.

20
00:00:53,054 --> 00:00:55,973
And I read the script,
and we're chatting about this movie

21
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:58,976
as being something
you were very passionate about

22
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,604
- for a while, right?
- Yes. Oh, yeah. No, we... Dan and I...

23
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,023
I think we've been
working on this for what?

24
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,584
- Seven years?
- Yeah, six, seven years.

25
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:09,612
I want to say it was 2011
when we sold the book to Fox.

26
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:12,216
By the way, we've not been
talking about the cup shaking,

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,366
which was very hard to get.

28
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:17,662
- People might think that was an easy bit.
- I wanted that cup shaking so bad.

29
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,712
I know. We...
I think we got it right.

30
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:21,141
- Yeah.
- But there was...

31
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:23,000
<i>Every war starts quietly.</i>

32
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,603
It's a long journey getting there.

33
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,337
- Yes.
- Yeah, so...

34
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,675
It's always good to start a movie
with a kid dying in cafeteria class room.

35
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,052
It's always... one of those

36
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,888
sort of movie 101s
that they teach you at school.

37
00:01:35,972 --> 00:01:38,224
Pretty much, but this moment
was in the book,

38
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,493
- and it's also...
- Yes.

39
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:42,186
In the script,
in the very early passes of the script.

40
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,897
It started off the whole
story with such a bang.

41
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:47,024
I feel like the...

42
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,237
What we had in the early scripts,
most of it's still in the movie.

43
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,073
The script while it
always got better and better,

44
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:57,326
the bones of it were always,
story-wise, very much the same.

45
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,805
<i>Strange and unexplained incidents
involving surviving children...</i>

46
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,723
- Definitely.
- Except for this scene, which you

47
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,850
always find that, when you finish
a movie, you have to go back

48
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:07,670
and reshoot all your newscast scenes
to better fit the movie.

49
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:10,923
I think everyone makes the mistake
of doing them while you're filming,

50
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:14,218
which makes sense, but somehow your story
shifts, and then it never tracks,

51
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:16,846
and you always do these quick
reshoots with the newscasters.

52
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,347
- Like this.
- Like this.

53
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:23,561
It's like a fancy little pickup shot
that we got on the Fox lot.

54
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:25,126
- Yep.
- Yes, we did.

55
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,189
We shot this all in Atlanta,

56
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:31,235
but this was something we did in LA
a few months back, just to, uh...

57
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,671
Get the information exactly right

58
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,339
- that he's talking about.
- Yeah, move the story along,

59
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,799
- set it up a little better.
- Yeah, I think that's...

60
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,635
the beginning of our movie, we always
had to figure out how to get the...

61
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,420
It's always a balance
of world-building, and yet getting at it

62
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:43,497
- in an emotional way.
- Right.

63
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,184
Getting across
all of our characters, like Clancy there.

64
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:51,797
And... what's also nice is
starting off with a little bit of sympathy

65
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:55,718
so that you kind of feel for the dad
dealing with the fact his son

66
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,404
- is going through all this stuff.
- Personalize it.

67
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:58,304
Yeah.

68
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:00,324
I think, throughout
every step of the process,

69
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,975
we're always trying to find
those little emotional beats

70
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,977
to put in there to humanize everyone

71
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:09,648
and keep this from becoming
so straight-out about the dystopia.

72
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:11,752
- It's more about people.
- I think that's why

73
00:03:11,776 --> 00:03:13,295
we wanted to cast
Bradley as the president,

74
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,988
just because he felt grounded
and real, and...

75
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,741
Yeah. This was probably the first...

76
00:03:18,824 --> 00:03:20,427
Do you remember
there was a big thunderstorm?

77
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:21,887
This was the first day of shooting.

78
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,347
Yeah, there was
a huge storm outside.

79
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:25,474
- We were worried about losing power.
- It was the very first day of shoot.

80
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:31,295
This was the scene where me and the DP,
Kramer, and H, the first AD,

81
00:03:31,504 --> 00:03:33,631
were crammed in the kid's closet
around the corner,

82
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,942
- 'cause there was no room.
- Yeah. Felt very left out.

83
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:40,763
Yeah... Literally no room
in the closet. It was about two by two.

84
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,848
<i>You don't have to worry about me.</i>

85
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,059
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

86
00:03:49,814 --> 00:03:51,190
<i>Okay, bed time.</i>

87
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,191
<i>I love you.</i>

88
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:05,121
So, this wasn't
in the book, and it's...

89
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,623
This is a late addition
in developing the script.

90
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,125
Right. It was a late addition.

91
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:13,045
It was something that we wanted
to make sure that you thought of...

92
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:16,549
You're with little Ruby
as she's thinking about her parents

93
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:22,221
and trying to give a tangible goal
for her to try to get home for...

94
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:25,057
Like, she's thinking about home,
so this is the object she looks at

95
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,327
- when she's thinking about home.
- Mm-hmm.

96
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,603
And there was no
physical object in the book.

97
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,248
How did that pop in your head?

98
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,792
- What's the back story there?
- Funnily enough, a friend of ours

99
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:36,193
who's a story artist,
actually, in live action,

100
00:04:36,277 --> 00:04:40,573
Amy, gave my husband
a souvenir card from Japan

101
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,199
when she went traveling to Japan.

102
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,083
I remember seeing
early props of that.

103
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:50,499
It's always fun when
you're working on a story,

104
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,293
seeing how an idea evolves.

105
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:55,129
- Right.
- And as we did more passes

106
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:56,672
deep into prep,

107
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,842
seeing how it became more prevalent
in the script and more important

108
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,802
as you'll see later in the movie, too.

109
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:05,431
Right, and the fact that,
of course, later on in the movie,

110
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,726
the fact that it becomes this thing
that Ruby gives Liam

111
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,436
sort of to send him away with,

112
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,815
again, it's a visual way
of showing, "remember me."

113
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,234
I remember
with Mike Sable in props,

114
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:19,111
looking at the different versions,

115
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,882
- and trying to figure out...
- Yeah, there were some ugly ones.

116
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:24,509
- And then there's some cute ones.
- I was worried this one was

117
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,511
too small, but it actually
turned out to be just right.

118
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:28,847
- It fits well in a kid's hand.
- Fits well in the hand.

119
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,873
Yeah, 'cause you have
something too big,

120
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:34,502
and then you think the guards
are really stupid for missing it, but...

121
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,230
Everyone watching and wondering,
this is actually a real house.

122
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,130
We did not build this.

123
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:40,424
We took over someone's house

124
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:42,801
who was nice enough to rent it to us.

125
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:47,515
There was this awesome motorcycle in
the garage that we had to shoot around.

126
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:51,685
I think they had to move it out,
but it was just a crazy-huge cruiser bike

127
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,230
with an Evel Knievel color scheme.

128
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,249
- Nice.
- I wanted to keep it.

129
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,043
- How is that not in the movie?
- I don't know.

130
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:01,070
Well, I guess we should've
talked to the prop master.

131
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,405
Is it too late?

132
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,032
Oh, man.

133
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,493
Lidya was so good.

134
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,013
- Yeah. She was great, a real pro.
- Yeah, she...

135
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,932
All our kid actors were
so good in this movie.

136
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:15,000
We really lucked out.
Not only were they great actors

137
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:19,255
and performers and professionals,
but they're really nice to be around.

138
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,214
Yeah.

139
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,634
And Lidya was talking about how
she wants to be a veterinarian.

140
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,636
I thought, "She has it all planned out."

141
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,806
Hopefully, we didn't ruin that
by giving her a taste of acting.

142
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:34,019
The one thing to talk about would
be just past the scenes of the landscape

143
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,272
as they're leaving, as we really
didn't want this movie

144
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:38,357
to be your typical YA dystopian,

145
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:43,028
"Far in the future, buildings raised,
big war had been fought."

146
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,197
We really wanted it to feel
a minute in the future

147
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:47,241
and just, really, the absence of children.

148
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,493
What would the world look like
without kids in it?

149
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,680
- And part of it...
- And we wanted a big truck.

150
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:53,747
- Right.
- And we got that.

151
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:56,625
I sat in that. That was awesome.
I want to take that home.

152
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:59,646
Actually, there's a picture of you
and I in it, and I look really awful.

153
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:02,298
I really remember being like,
"Damn, I missed a good photo op."

154
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,717
It was a terrible angle for me.

155
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,637
Hey, it's a set. Everyone's sweaty
and ugly on set except for the actors.

156
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,350
But this set was really one
of the first ones we chose, wasn't it?

157
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:18,272
Because of the amazing color inside
these buildings, which was all practical.

158
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:22,401
And it's pretty creepy and uncanny

159
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:26,071
how these scenes
are mirroring what's going on

160
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:29,275
with, you know, the tragedies that are
going on in the world right now, with...

161
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:31,744
- It is a bit...
- kids being rounded up

162
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,346
- by the government.
- Again, this...

163
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,205
This was written a while ago, years ago.

164
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:37,333
The book was written
many years ago,

165
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,256
and the scripts were written
many years before,

166
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:44,256
but it is chilling when you see sort
of a dystopian future become real.

167
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,301
- Right.
- As your movie's coming out.

168
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,386
But those...

169
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:53,474
Something to note is, in that scene
where the kids are walking through

170
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:58,395
the barbed wire fencing
and the chain link little enclosures,

171
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,939
all the color in there was
one of the big things

172
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:04,610
that I got really excited about
when we walked into this location,

173
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,405
'cause there's this rose,
and this beautiful green

174
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,325
and it's the most beautiful prison
you could imagine.

175
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,927
- You get that contrast of...
- Yeah.

176
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,804
- Nature, and this...
- So it's not depressing.

177
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,999
There's always color,
and Kramer Morgenthau, the DP,

178
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,919
was very much intent on colors.

179
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:25,255
One of the first things we talked about
was trying to get color into the movie.

180
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,885
And so, even in a room like this,
which should be just sterile and white,

181
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:35,224
we put this mint green and little colors
everywhere so it doesn't feel drab.

182
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:39,088
Speaking of colors, we spent a lot
of time figuring out that color pyramid.

183
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,815
A lot of things got flipped and flopped,
who's most powerful.

184
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:47,277
Yeah. I think the fact that we
don't notice might be a good thing!

185
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,529
Yeah.

186
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:52,658
Poor... Poor Björn had to redo
that pyramid how many times?

187
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,452
Our visual effects
supervisor, yes. Many times.

188
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:58,747
"Who's more powerful? If an orange
is more powerful than a red, then..."

189
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,711
These guys were awesome.

190
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:07,297
- I wanted one of those outfits so bad.
- Yes, that was a big victory,

191
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,924
the wardrobe on the soldiers.

192
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:13,721
Yeah, 'cause it's... accurate,
but not accurate.

193
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:15,740
- Yes.
- It's not slavishly accurate.

194
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,015
It's a kind of slight feature.

195
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:20,978
Yeah. It's a real military uniform
with some slight tweaks

196
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:24,314
to make it feel more
Orwellian and scarier.

197
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:28,360
One of things that's important
is trying to get the look

198
00:09:28,444 --> 00:09:31,029
of a near, possible future...

199
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,674
- Yeah.
- Rather than something far.

200
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,033
- Mm-hmm.
- And I'm a real geek as far

201
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:36,618
as military, tech and weaponry.

202
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:39,747
- Yes, you love that stuff.
- I do. I really do.

203
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:43,226
One of my favorite memories
in prep is you testing the flame thrower.

204
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,586
- I did.
- Yeah.

205
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:47,522
- You were good at it.
- That thing had a kick.

206
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,965
I enjoyed that a little too much, I think.

207
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:55,053
But that was fun. That was really fun,
and that thing is hot.

208
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,973
- Yeah, one would think.
- Yeah.

209
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,077
Maybe Elon Musk figured it out
with his that it's no longer hot, but...

210
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,855
These shots are really chilling, because
you're starting to see images in the news

211
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,150
that are so uncannily similar.

212
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,503
- Yeah, and they get...
- Someone sent me a picture,

213
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,287
and I thought, "Oh my God,
that's our movie."

214
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,840
And then I realized,
"Wait a minute. That's real."

215
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,717
And again, this was all
completely unintentional,

216
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,178
because a couple of years ago,
when we were thinking up this thing,

217
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:20,287
we were thinking,
"Oh, this is science fiction."

218
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:23,165
You don't have to worry
about science fiction so much.

219
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,268
- "Oh, it's so unlikely to happen."
- Right.

220
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,377
- And yet it did.
- And yet it does.

221
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:28,921
<i>Hey! Let's go! Move!</i>

222
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:31,465
This is our first shot
of Ruby as an adult.

223
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,652
- And...
- Oh, that's right. Yes.

224
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,437
- Yes, our very first shot.
- In our famed shoe factory.

225
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,348
Wanted to make sure that you see her

226
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,892
as a person suffering
through all this stuff.

227
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,811
And Wade.

228
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:47,332
- Yes, our beloved Captain.
- Wade, one of the sweetest,

229
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:48,857
most wonderful guys in the world.

230
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,794
- You'd never know in this scene.
- In person.

231
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,418
- In person.
- But on se...

232
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,280
He got into this character.
He was amazing.

233
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,784
He's bloody intimidating on screen,
but he's such a sweetheart.

234
00:10:58,867 --> 00:10:59,910
He really is.

235
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,913
And he would bring
his fiddle on set.

236
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,850
- Was that his?
- Yeah, no, Amandla had one.

237
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,144
I remember he had a guitar,
because I remember during the night shoots

238
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,588
I would try to catch a nap,
and I'd hear someone playing a guitar,

239
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,132
and it would be driving me crazy,
and I realized it was Wade.

240
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,968
Well, Wade was playing guitar...

241
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,238
- He was good.
- And he also had a fiddle,

242
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,681
and Amandla had a violin,
and in between takes,

243
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:22,742
- everybody was playing on stuff.
- I remember the campfire...

244
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,661
Yeah, when we were in the woods,
everyone playing along.

245
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:26,204
I didn't realize the fiddle
came from Wade,

246
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:27,771
- but it makes sense.
- Yeah.

247
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,483
When we're in that train house scene
later in the movie, he...

248
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,815
It was his last day, and he showed up
with a fiddle,

249
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,381
and he was just playing for everybody,

250
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,590
- as part of his...
- And he had wrapped weeks earlier.

251
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,325
- Yeah.
- Like, "Wade, you're here?"

252
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:41,742
Oh, man.

253
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,332
And again, this is supposed to be

254
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:51,962
this dystopian horrible, you know,
prison shoe factory,

255
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:54,339
but look how pretty it is
through the windows

256
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:57,968
- and the way the mist is coming through.
- I remember walking onto the set,

257
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,345
and Kramer did such a great job, our DP,

258
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:04,016
with lighting this,
and Russell, with the set design.

259
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:07,811
It was really wonder... Remember
it was so good that we thought,

260
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:10,540
- "Wow, we're only shooting one day here?"
- Yeah, "Can we do more?"

261
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:13,543
I remember you were trying to
figure out what else we could shoot there,

262
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,735
but it really is hard to...

263
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,779
It's one scene, so you really can't
go back there, but man...

264
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,199
We were going to have this white
noise sound test in the shoe factory,

265
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:22,552
- but it just...
- Oh, that's right.

266
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:24,896
You and I had a lot
of spirited debates about that,

267
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:25,972
whether it could work or not.

268
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:29,291
We ended up shooting it outside,
but I was thinking about it.

269
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:32,920
I even aborted the whole scene
as if it continued on

270
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,213
- in the shoe factory.
- Yeah. I blame myself.

271
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:38,702
If all those things were...

272
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,178
If we had more time,
maybe we should've done it both ways.

273
00:12:41,345 --> 00:12:42,930
- Right.
- But we didn't.

274
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,389
<i>Ruby, can you hear me?</i>

275
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,267
Now, this is Mandy's first shot
in the movie.

276
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,227
<i>You're gonna be fine, Ruby.</i>

277
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:53,815
As the face of humanity and warmth
of the resistance organization.

278
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,277
<i>Do you know where you are?</i>

279
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,697
This was a fun set.

280
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,701
Again, this was all stuff
that was there at that location.

281
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:08,956
Not the hospital beds, but the metal
cage walls and all that stuff.

282
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,851
- Yeah, the chain-link fence walls.
- The ambiance was waiting for you.

283
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,462
- This was a real find, this location.
- Yeah. Such a beautiful place.

284
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,924
I almost wanted to move in there.
It was great. But it was such a cool...

285
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:20,842
- Really?
- No. Not really.

286
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,612
- Yeah. It was pretty...
- It was gnarly.

287
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,447
Just like, right out
of a dystopia movie.

288
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:26,366
- It was...
- It used to be an air base?

289
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,785
- Or it was a military base?
- I think it was the military surplus

290
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,602
because it was
right next to a train station.

291
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,286
Right. Lot of trains in Atlanta.

292
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,665
- A lot of trains.
- Yep.

293
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:36,450
And having to film between trains,
planes and automobiles was...

294
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,585
We actually lucked out.

295
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,449
I've worked on other films where you
have to yell cut because of trains.

296
00:13:40,988 --> 00:13:44,199
Right. But the lights were moved in.

297
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:49,496
Russell put those lights up there so
that we could have some retro feel to it,

298
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:55,919
but those steel enclosures were either
moved from places elsewhere

299
00:13:56,086 --> 00:14:00,424
in this building or found to look exactly
like what was already there.

300
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:03,951
We didn't talk about the...

301
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:08,265
How hard it was to get the prison outfits,
the coloring right,

302
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,018
what shade of green should it be,
because some were too lime green

303
00:14:11,143 --> 00:14:13,603
and some were too dark,
and it took a lot of work.

304
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,773
Yeah, these are all scrubs
that you can buy online,

305
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:19,085
- because they're actual scrubs.
- That was a smart idea

306
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:22,446
that we should go with
what would really happen,

307
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:26,908
although now, I wonder
what really happened, but... Um... Uh...

308
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,326
Yes, off-the-rack.

309
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,596
- Off-the-rack, distressed.
- But dyed.

310
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,457
And so you can feel that use,

311
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:36,764
but pretty much that's what they use
in juvenile detention centers.

312
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:41,423
And try to, again, keep that grounded,
real feel to the movie.

313
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,969
What I love about this scene is
this is one of those scenes

314
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:50,348
that really came together in post,
that initially it wasn't a timed breakout,

315
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,809
- it was a much slower-paced scene.
- Yeah.

316
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,287
And our editor, Dean Zimmerman,

317
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:58,148
had the brilliant idea of,
"Make it feel like a prison break"

318
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,691
with alarms going off, and...

319
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:03,028
The fact he put that sound
of the alarm in the background

320
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,864
was the thing that really gave it.
A bit of a drive.

321
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,907
It changed everything. Re-cut it,
and it gave urgency to a scene...

322
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:14,039
that we didn't quite have
in the earlier cuts.

323
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:18,960
One of the big pluses of this whole
location was Russell really pushed

324
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:23,090
to get those lights on the buildings
back there, those diagonal light bars.

325
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:27,302
It makes the whole place
look so cool.

326
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,805
<i>Hey, I got Dr. Rogers with me.</i>

327
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,558
And Wade was such a trooper.
This is cold rain.

328
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:36,394
This is water that's
just flowing for hours,

329
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:39,665
- drenching him through his outfit.
- That guy never complained once.

330
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,209
- Yeah.
- He is a man's man.

331
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,419
And I'd go up to him and say,
"Wade, do you need a blanket?

332
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:45,671
Do you need to just dry off
for a second between setups?"

333
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:49,449
He's like, "Nope, I'm fine."
And he was literally shaking.

334
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:53,620
He did not look fine,
but he's like oh, Navy SEAL man.

335
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:56,748
I mean, he was gonna
man his way through it.

336
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:59,268
Stayed in character while we were
all huddled under a tent.

337
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,522
- Yeah, dealing with the mosquitos.
- Yeah, he was great in this scene.

338
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:03,797
He was really great.

339
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,478
Remember he wanted to do
a version where he had his gun out?

340
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,834
- Yeah.
- He wanted to go full commando...

341
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,323
- We actually shot it that way.
- Did we do a take with that?

342
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,783
- Yeah. We did a few takes.
- It didn't work.

343
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,326
We tried a couple, and it didn't work,
and then we...

344
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,562
Yeah, it was more menacing
for him not to have it.

345
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,440
Just the gesture of him
reaching for it was enough to...

346
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,211
Another thing we can talk about
was the eye glow which is something

347
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:28,238
you championed early on,
and I think a lot of us were like,

348
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,049
- "That's not going to work."
- We were skeptics.

349
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,260
"Maybe Jen will forget about that,
we won't do that, and..."

350
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:33,702
I would not forget about it.

351
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,264
- You didn't forget about it...
- I am a hardcore...

352
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:39,082
and thankfully you pressed
on it, and it really works.

353
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:42,294
I'm an eye freak.
I love weird effects on eyes.

354
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,087
I guess it's, like, that anime background.

355
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,130
Right.

356
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,716
And I just love weird stuff
happening with eyes.

357
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,261
By the way, this is, again,
more of a different take

358
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,738
- on a dystopian future...
- Yeah.

359
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,764
Where it's
the absence of things.

360
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,267
Not destruction,
but the absence of children, and...

361
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,144
Not a muted palette.

362
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,771
It's actually very green
and optimistic outside.

363
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,815
It's just a lack of children.

364
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,780
- And no zombies.
- No zombies.

365
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:09,696
- Look at those cows.
- Despite our asking for them.

366
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:12,199
A lot of this footage
of the interior of the car

367
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,825
was on the day when me and Kramer

368
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:19,206
were kind of, you know, pissed off
and full of piss and vinegar,

369
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,975
and we said,
"We're gonna get these shots!"

370
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,460
And he jumped in that little car,
that little physical car.

371
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:27,172
I jumped in the back, and he shot that
stuff hanging out the window!

372
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,108
That's right. I also love...
We're not there yet.

373
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,444
When he got on that golf cart
and just started shooting stuff

374
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,904
hanging off the back of it when we...

375
00:17:32,928 --> 00:17:34,572
- Oh, yeah.
- We'll get there a bit later.

376
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,765
That was that golden hour stuff.

377
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:40,352
Like, to try to get it
that beautiful light wherever we could.

378
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,900
It certainly is beautiful stuff.
And then this whole ride through,

379
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:51,029
we had other footage of really dystopian
wrecked buildings

380
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,506
- and stuff like that.
- Yeah.

381
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,157
Some really beautiful shots,

382
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:58,954
but ultimately,
it made it seem too destroyed.

383
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:02,540
Right, because what this was...
The world didn't go away.

384
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,144
I mean, there are no children,
and the future is obviously in question,

385
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:10,840
but parents, older people were still alive
and so, maybe the economy crashed,

386
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:15,595
but buildings still stood,
and people still went about their lives.

387
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:18,199
I think we're running on the idea
that this is six years later,

388
00:18:18,223 --> 00:18:19,099
and not 60, you know?

389
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,285
- Yeah.
- This is still a very near future.

390
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,663
The only people that were
very distressed were babysitters

391
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:24,872
because they were all out of work.

392
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,856
- Oh, man.
- Nannies took a hit.

393
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,402
I've got to say, though,
I love the beautiful destruction

394
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,029
of completely destroyed buildings
and stuff.

395
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,990
That'd be cool to do at some point.

396
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:39,327
- We'll do that in the sequel.
- Okay. Total destruction.

397
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,497
I love Patina. That's what it is. Patina.

398
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,790
<i>Those like you are...</i>

399
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,710
But I do remember early days
when you talked...

400
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:49,379
Remember, we almost shot this
movie in the fall-winter,

401
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:53,216
but it was very important for you to have
the foliage and the green and the life

402
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,843
to feel different.

403
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:59,597
I remember the meeting at Fox
where we were gonna rush into production,

404
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:02,142
and they said,
"How do you feel about...

405
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,829
waiting, like, six more months,"
something like that?

406
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:07,248
Yeah, which is a producer's
nightmare, because a lot could go wrong.

407
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:08,392
I saw you guys' faces.

408
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,775
Your faces looked pale
when they suggested pushing it...

409
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,045
- What happens is suddenly...
- I could see Dan tense up,

410
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,506
feeling, "That's six months of any problem
that could derail the movie."

411
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,632
Yeah, this movie vanishing,

412
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,843
Jen taking another movie,
the actors not being available.

413
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,244
But it was the right move
for the look of the movie.

414
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,955
Yeah, because we would have had
a very brown movie

415
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,665
with brown, leafless trees...

416
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:26,749
Yep.

417
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:28,436
And it just worked out

418
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,796
to get the beautiful foliage
and the color this way.

419
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:34,215
This is Mark O'Brien.

420
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,011
Our good friend and has been
in a few movies of 21 Laps,

421
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,722
- and he always comes through.
- Yeah.

422
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,118
Personally... He personally
picked that jacket for himself.

423
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:46,227
He was shown some options,
and he liked that one.

424
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,479
Did he take it home?

425
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,940
No, he probably didn't.
Although actually, I don't know.

426
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,585
I'm gonna call him.

427
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,249
<i>Soap, some other things, a bathroom...</i>

428
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,489
I think there was a boring time
while we were setting up

429
00:19:57,572 --> 00:20:00,825
some stuff in this area,
and Amandla got bored

430
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,536
and took one of the set dressing
little mini pink bikes

431
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,038
and was riding around in the road!

432
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,640
Oh, yeah. That's right.

433
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,918
That's also... That creepy
gas station is where I got bit

434
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,419
by some strange bug.

435
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:14,565
Yeah, it was like some predator bug.
You had three bite marks like a triangle.

436
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:17,109
I know, and two different spots,
and they lasted for about three months.

437
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:19,570
We thought maybe you were gonna
get flesh-eating bacteria

438
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:20,845
and die on us or something.

439
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,598
I know. I was
pretty sure it was the end.

440
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,369
And that, by the way,
is not much different than

441
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,396
what this convenient mart looked like
in real life. It was a weird...

442
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,333
- It looked nicer than that.
- We didn't do much to distress it.

443
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:35,485
We happened upon some good,
ready locations, is what it sounds like.

444
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,320
Yeah, this was another find. Um...

445
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,632
- It's so awesome.
- Even though it was very far away,

446
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,908
part of you is like,
"This looks perfect for the movie."

447
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,662
The other part is, "God, I'm gonna be
stuck in traffic for a really long time."

448
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:48,270
Does it have to look this good?
Maybe we could do it closer."

449
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:52,043
This was far, but I think
what got me on this location

450
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:56,131
was the color of the refrigerator units.

451
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,466
That's usually what is
the key thing...

452
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,510
for a shoot.

453
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,011
That's where your eye went.

454
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:06,516
This is our first shot
with Miya, who was...

455
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,619
- Miya!
- The most awesome person ever.

456
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,478
Miya is such a sweetheart.

457
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:15,483
She is so, like, genuinely cute,
not like put-on cute.

458
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,608
Yeah.

459
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,235
So outgoing.

460
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,173
- She chats a lot.
- And I love... I got to say, her...

461
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,592
And yet, you wouldn't know that
with a character that never speaks.

462
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,553
- No. She never speaks.
- I love her...

463
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:29,247
And we owe it to you, Jen. I love
her costume, because that really was...

464
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:33,084
You know, that big hooded sweatshirt with
the yellow gloves and the military boots

465
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:34,752
was such an iconic look.

466
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,214
- Yeah, that was fun.
- I think she'll be a fan favorite,

467
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,298
I really do.

468
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,469
I really think she's so, so cool,

469
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:46,764
and in the book, it went a lot more into
what her back story was,

470
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:50,268
and I know she has a new book
that's all about her.

471
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:51,769
- So...
- Spoiler alert.

472
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,387
- Well...
- Yeah, no, I know. Um...

473
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:58,234
- Here come Harris and Skylan.
- The first time we see the guys.

474
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,254
The dream team's together
for the first time.

475
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,548
They're together
for the very first time in the van.

476
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:05,200
The full van kids scene.

477
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:08,578
Russell did a great job,
our production designer,

478
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,247
with the interior of the van.
We really wanted it to feel like

479
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:12,582
a home away from home.

480
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,059
- The kids live there.
- Yep.

481
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,960
It's where they learn, eat, sleep.

482
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:18,922
They would hang out in this van
in between takes

483
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,132
simply 'cause it was convenient and comfy,

484
00:22:21,216 --> 00:22:23,694
- and they had all their stuff in there.
- You know, the van,

485
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,721
we shipped it out to LA, we have it.
We should take it to the premiere.

486
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,140
Yeah. We should
just park it out there. Why not.

487
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,809
They wanted to take it home.

488
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:33,353
I bet.

489
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,980
If we had left everyone alone,
I think all this stuff

490
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:37,500
would've disappeared.

491
00:22:37,524 --> 00:22:39,943
'Cause everybody wanted
to take the van with them.

492
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:44,155
But super comfy,
and all the stuff in the back,

493
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:47,784
and drawings, and little corners
for everyone's little...

494
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,987
- It felt lived in.
- Specialization.

495
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,830
<i>- No strays!
- Wait. I'll handle this.</i>

496
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,875
And Amandla
had just learned how to drive

497
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,710
when she did this movie, didn't she?

498
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,379
Which works out well,

499
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,857
'cause she's not supposed to be
a good driver, and she pulled it off.

500
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,133
Yeah, remember we were gonna
get to the motel scene?

501
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:07,804
It was a little nerve-racking
to get her to stop in the right spot,

502
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,657
- because she was...
- It's also a huge van.

503
00:23:09,681 --> 00:23:10,682
Yes. That, too.

504
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:13,487
<i>- In a beat-up blue minivan.
- That's no way to talk about Betty.</i>

505
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:16,271
- Skylan was so good in this too.
- Yeah.

506
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,415
I really loved what he did
with the character,

507
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:25,280
because Chubs was probably
one of the latest adjustments that we did.

508
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,883
- His character was the hardest to find.
- Yeah... There was a draft

509
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:31,327
where his character just
got that sense of humor,

510
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:34,205
and a real life and spark to him,
and a real personality,

511
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:35,289
and uh...

512
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:37,768
- Skylan just killed it.
- Yeah. He really nailed it.

513
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,919
Here comes a very fast gold car.

514
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:42,088
Very first shot of Lady Jane.

515
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:44,756
<i>It's Lady Jane!</i>

516
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,443
Gwendoline was cool.
It was interesting,

517
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,261
trying to find her look, 'cause...

518
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,263
Yeah, remember we had
almost a flannel,

519
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:52,533
- Seattle look for her for a while?
- Yeah, we went full hillbilly.

520
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:54,326
- And a hunter look.
- Yeah, hunter-hillbilly look.

521
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,393
Red vest.

522
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,605
- And then we went biker.
- It didn't suit her at all.

523
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,457
- No.
- The hunter-hillbilly look.

524
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,001
One of the nicest people
you'll ever meet.

525
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,985
- She sure is.
- With a great laugh.

526
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:08,406
I think the first time I met her,

527
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,034
first of all, I was amazed
I was meeting her.

528
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:14,621
I think we're all huge
<i>Game of Thrones</i> fans.

529
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,914
- Yeah.
- And yeah, she was so cool.

530
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:20,501
She was not in the movie much,
but great having her there.

531
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:25,590
But she drove in this car.
There's a guy on the roof of the car.

532
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,259
The pod drivers are up there driving.

533
00:24:28,343 --> 00:24:31,179
The stunt guys are driving,
but the actor's in the car

534
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,640
in these shots,
they're not in some green-screen studio.

535
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:34,641
No.

536
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,578
For everyone watching, basically,
there was a little pod that sits on top

537
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:40,355
of these cars where you have a stunt man
driving the actual car

538
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,608
and then you erase it in post
with visual effects.

539
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:46,944
You just wipe it out so you don't see them
so it looks just like a regular car.

540
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,406
But the actor, though, is in the car
through the movements of this.

541
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,009
Yeah, they're getting
banged around.

542
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:54,619
They're feeling the impact
and the Gs and all this stuff.

543
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:56,329
I remember in the...

544
00:24:56,913 --> 00:25:03,503
There was great outtakes with Mandy
and with Mark just having a blast.

545
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:06,506
The banter between them
in between takes was hilarious.

546
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:07,507
Yeah.

547
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:10,009
And here, Harris gets to lean out
the back of the car.

548
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,886
He is in full body harness here.

549
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:16,599
This car is booking. Like, on the road,
moving fast, for reals.

550
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,060
And he is heavily strapped in.

551
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,352
- Yes, which is a good thing.
- Yeah.

552
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:22,605
Safety first.

553
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:25,224
- But he had such fun doing this.
- Yeah.

554
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:30,363
We're going up and down the road,
him hanging out the back of this van!

555
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,158
Us yelling orders through the intercom.

556
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:39,122
I'm impressed that Chubs
can hold him as he leans out the...

557
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:40,645
- Arm strength.
- Yeah.

558
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,127
That is his super ability, his great grip.

559
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:48,464
- But Jack Gill, he is of course...
- Our stunt coordinator, great guy.

560
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:52,135
Our stunt extraordinaire
and <i>Fast and Furious</i> vet.

561
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:55,614
- Yeah, this was easy for him.
- Yeah, this was small beans I guess.

562
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:58,891
But still, he's so good,
and watching...

563
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,786
His brother was
on top one of the cars.

564
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:03,521
Yeah. I think he was
on top of Lady Jane's car.

565
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:06,124
Do you remember how many
meetings we had about the tree?

566
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,794
Oh my gosh.
We had so many meetings about that tree.

567
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,945
Practical tree, visual effects.

568
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,573
The thing that seems the simplest,

569
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:18,286
"throw a tree," is really hard,
because a tree is bloody heavy.

570
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:22,790
And trying to find a real tree was
ten times harder than finding a fake tree.

571
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:23,958
A lot of meetings

572
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:25,293
about the tree.

573
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:27,456
We did use a real tree,
but it was embellished.

574
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:28,897
Remember how cold it was this day?

575
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:32,216
It was warm in Atlanta,
but we went a couple hours north

576
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,885
and it was very cold that day.

577
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:37,221
This scene was actually done
fairly early on.

578
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:40,075
- But this was added later.
- This is a little tiny pickup shot.

579
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,518
This scene was a late addition,
this exact moment.

580
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:44,788
- That little moment was...
- But the rest of it,

581
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:46,898
everything outside the van is...

582
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:50,985
This was on the very first week
of shoot, like day three,

583
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:56,157
and on this beautiful country road
with cows meandering around.

584
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:57,950
And it was freezing.

585
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,620
- It was cold.
- It was odd.

586
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:03,539
Just when you think you escape
the trains, the cows show up.

587
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:10,838
What's interesting about Harris
is that we cast him off his audition,

588
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:15,635
and he had starred in a movie called
<i>Beach Rats</i> that had gone to a festival,

589
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,053
but we hadn't seen it yet.

590
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:19,931
And then we saw
the movie after casting him...

591
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:21,325
And then felt really smart,

592
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:24,036
- because he was so good in it.
- He's incredible in <i>Beach Rats.</i>

593
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,355
Oh, you could tell, even in this
very casual audition tape

594
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:29,315
that he did, very casual, like, you know,

595
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,318
this is a read that agents
send you, like, "This person exists."

596
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,822
He was amazing just in that casual read.

597
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:38,008
- Yeah. You knew he was special.
- He wasn't even trying.

598
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:39,032
<i>You should come with us.</i>

599
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:42,078
Jen was the unsung hero
of this scene.

600
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,872
Jen actually did take a bite
of a Twinkie and ate it

601
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:48,125
- just to see what a Twinkie tastes like.
- I did, and I'm still alive.

602
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:51,462
No. It was actually really good.
I really loved Twinkies when I was a kid,

603
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:55,383
but there was a lot of
Twinkies in this set.

604
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,968
- A lot.
- And pickles.

605
00:27:57,051 --> 00:27:58,779
We went through boxes
and boxes of pickles.

606
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:01,347
Oh my gosh.
I completely forgot about that!

607
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,825
- Yeah.
- That was Kramer, right?

608
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:05,810
- Kramer and...
- And our script supervisor.

609
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,688
So, our script supervisor
and Kramer, the DP,

610
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:11,357
had this ongoing pickle feud where

611
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:16,195
they would sneak these gigantic,
awful, disgusting-looking dill pickles

612
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,173
- in a plastic...
- Well to be fair, they were

613
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,741
on craft services,
individually bagged and yes,

614
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:23,828
Steve Gehrke, our script supervisor
extraordinaire, and Kramer

615
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:27,707
had an ongoing battle
of who could stash pickles and...

616
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:31,419
And you'd find them
in the side pocket of your chair or like...

617
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:33,462
- Your backpack.
- In your backpack.

618
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:35,840
I remember that,
the last day of shooting,

619
00:28:35,923 --> 00:28:38,467
Steve put it on Kramer's
windshield wipers.

620
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:41,721
He hollowed the pickles out
and put them over each windshield wiper.

621
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:42,722
It kept going.

622
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:46,183
Apparently, someone put a pickle
in Kramer's bag and he got to the airport.

623
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,828
That's right,
and they had to check it.

624
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:49,788
- He got to the airport and...
- It's like <i>Spinal Tap.</i>

625
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:50,980
Security...

626
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:53,232
Security found
this giant pickle!

627
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:55,067
It's fitting.

628
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:57,320
One of the great four shots
of the movie there.

629
00:28:57,403 --> 00:28:58,403
Yeah.

630
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
Oh, man, that...

631
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:05,119
Also just wanted to say
that the slicing of the Twinkie...

632
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:09,957
I just love in this movie
when the powers are used casually

633
00:29:10,041 --> 00:29:11,751
as kind of a gesture,
whether it's that,

634
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,021
- or unhooking the tire...
- Right, not a big effect, yeah.

635
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:18,841
Or during later, when he drags her
to dance. Just a really, you know...

636
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,777
- It's natural.
- Yeah, it's natural,

637
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,721
and it's not usually
how you see powers used

638
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:27,308
in these kind of films,
and it's a nice approach.

639
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,519
This is another scene
that we redid.

640
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:33,898
We did very minimal reshoots
on this movie.

641
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:36,651
I think just a couple of days.
And this was just one scene

642
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:39,820
that we did to add
a little bit more emotion

643
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:44,367
and a little bit
more of a trajectory to the relationship.

644
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:47,662
- A little bite. A little pushback.
- Yeah, a little... Yeah.

645
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,748
Not a lot, but just a little,
so you can see them...

646
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,560
Enough to show that that's not
an easy relationship where they...

647
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,187
Are seeing where they're
both coming from.

648
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:56,313
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

649
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:58,589
And how passionate he is
about the league.

650
00:29:58,673 --> 00:30:02,176
Where she's thinking,
possibly, they may be good,

651
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:03,761
he's had a different experience.

652
00:30:04,428 --> 00:30:08,015
That's a whole process of when
you're trying to make a relationship

653
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,518
- progress in a natural way...
- Yeah.

654
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:13,604
And you find these little areas
where you have to adjust it.

655
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:17,733
Like, originally, this scene
was just very, very soft.

656
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:21,320
He was gentle and nice,
and everyone was nice to each other.

657
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:22,798
- Too nice, yeah.
- Too nice.

658
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:25,133
Everyone was so nice that
there was nowhere for them to go.

659
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,077
Right,
and so the scenes that follow this

660
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:28,703
really benefit from the warmness

661
00:30:28,786 --> 00:30:30,681
between them, because you feel like
they've come over something.

662
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:31,848
- Overcome something.
- Yeah.

663
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:34,500
They just sort of laid there,
as moments go.

664
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:38,295
It didn't have any momentum.
It didn't have any sense of progress.

665
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:40,023
- Mm-hmm.
- Something also,

666
00:30:40,047 --> 00:30:43,175
starting with this scene,
and reshooting it, and then kind of

667
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:47,388
exploring the previous scene with them
outside with the Twinkie, was just getting

668
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:50,725
across the information about the league

669
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,059
and the back story about it

670
00:30:52,143 --> 00:30:54,863
'cause there's a lot to get across
and you don't want to feel like...

671
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,064
an information dump
which is always a problem.

672
00:30:57,148 --> 00:31:00,693
So really kind of methodically giving it
piece by piece which, in the end

673
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,171
- I think we did a really good job with.
- But more importantly,

674
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:06,365
we need to talk about
Wade and his intimidation factor

675
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:11,287
- in the scene, and...
- Wade is so, like... He goes there.

676
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,622
- He does.
- He's great. I'd be afraid to...

677
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:18,294
I remember we put in that foam wall.

678
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:22,089
What's behind our doctor actor
is a foam wall,

679
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:24,454
because we were worried
about him getting slammed into it.

680
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,677
It ended up being
perfectly fine, but still...

681
00:31:26,761 --> 00:31:31,015
This was a great moment, just
adding this hint of what are the reds.

682
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:34,685
I love the fact that all the reds
we really focus on are little.

683
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:35,769
Yeah.

684
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:39,565
- There's nothing scarier than...
- I love dangerous little kids.

685
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,651
They're far more scary
than dangerous adults, right?

686
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:45,380
I love that one liner. We had
a lot of versions of it, but it was funny.

687
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:48,032
This is the scene where
we were trying to get Amandla

688
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:50,534
to stop this giant hulking
old van on the right spot.

689
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,387
- On a wet pavement.
- On a wet pavement.

690
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,556
But just to go back
to that previous scene too,

691
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,167
that was something that we brought
in late, and it really brought...

692
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:02,755
You know, that establishes
that there is a real threat chasing them

693
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,340
for the rest of the movie.

694
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:07,134
It also is a way of showing
a taste of what the reds...

695
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:09,488
- Again, it helps you remember...
- A little grounding, remembering

696
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:11,889
- where she came from, and...
- Where she wants to go.

697
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:13,732
Right, what she wants
to get back to.

698
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:16,435
<i>Don't worry.</i>

699
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,355
<i>Nothing can take me away from you.</i>

700
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,528
This is one of my favorite
scenes and also... I mean, I don't...

701
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,027
It's about to come up, and, um...

702
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:29,240
- The socks.
- It was a big scene in the book.

703
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:31,551
I mean, one great thing
about our screenwriter, Chad Hodge

704
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:35,538
is he had a very good relationship
with author Alexandra Bracken,

705
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,332
and occasionally, we'd say,
"Well, we got to get rid of this or..."

706
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,352
and he'd be like, "No, no, no,
that's a fan favorite."

707
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:44,088
Yeah, he had, like, a Wikipedia
knowledge of what the must-haves were.

708
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:48,592
Um... And the sock scene was key.
In fact, I gave those socks to Alexandra.

709
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:51,762
- She visited the set that day, and...
- Yeah. Alex has the socks.

710
00:32:51,846 --> 00:32:53,639
She has the set socks.

711
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:56,851
Which she immediately then sold on eBay.

712
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,829
They're clean, new socks.

713
00:32:58,853 --> 00:32:59,895
They haven't been worn.

714
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:03,107
And again, to go to this scene
when we were talking earlier

715
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,569
about having to kind of bring in
conflict between them,

716
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:10,656
that makes the scene now an olive branch,
whereas without it, it's not.

717
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,324
It's just another tender moment.

718
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:15,077
And another nice thing too
was Skylan's just...

719
00:33:15,244 --> 00:33:18,539
You know, in a movie that can be
heavy and dramatic,

720
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:21,750
his moments of humor really work,

721
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,670
and always got a huge laugh
when we screened the movie,

722
00:33:24,837 --> 00:33:27,047
and it just was a really nice balance,

723
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:30,926
so when the movie felt a little heavy,
we could just see that these are kids.

724
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:32,779
- Yeah.
- And what's so great

725
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:37,474
about Skylan too, I mean, I think often,
when you see a team dynamic,

726
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,060
there's the funny kid,
but he... You really just...

727
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:41,979
Chubs feels like a very real person.

728
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,457
Yeah, he's not a one-line,
like, you cast a comedian.

729
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:47,610
- He's a really talented actor.
- Been with these kids for a while.

730
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:52,531
Also, you notice back then
the guys had color-coded blankets?

731
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,134
That's a little Easter egg for people.

732
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:56,887
Jen, wanna talk about this scene?
This was always a favorite moment.

733
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:59,014
I remember when you storyboarded it.
It was so beautiful.

734
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,166
This scene was... Originally Amandla,
Ruby's character, was not in this.

735
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:05,336
It was pure flashback
in the original draft,

736
00:34:05,586 --> 00:34:09,840
and it was just mainly focused on
the guys and what they were going through,

737
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:14,803
and I really felt that seeing
her visually in the scene

738
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,490
- gave sort of a dreamy quality to it.
- It was great.

739
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,309
What I love about this scene
is just the theme of our movie

740
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:25,648
about fighting back, about not accepting
being oppressed or beaten down,

741
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,107
that you can fight back,

742
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:29,985
you can use your powers, your abilities,
to fight back and win,

743
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:34,573
and that we do have to see people rise up
in real life, and...

744
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,951
Uh... And... And...

745
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:41,038
take on, you know, the establishment,
and I think this is a really timely movie.

746
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:42,957
This shot coming up kills me.

747
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:47,378
When we shot it, I literally was doing
a little happy dance

748
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:52,383
when Miya was looking back at camera
and stuff, because it's so sweet.

749
00:34:52,466 --> 00:34:55,469
That shot, it always felt like
a very iconic trailer shot.

750
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:56,636
Yeah.

751
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:02,726
I was playing music
in my headpiece, you know, watching this.

752
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:04,246
What was the music? The score?

753
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,706
- No. Obviously, we didn't have it.
- No. We didn't have score back then.

754
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,565
It was just basically
this weird electronic...

755
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:10,943
- Was it Britney Spears?
- No, it wasn't.

756
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:13,112
No, it was definitely. No, it wasn't.

757
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:16,156
- It was atmospheric, weird European stuff.
- Nice.

758
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:19,785
<i>Are you okay, Zu?</i>

759
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:23,080
He shot that entire scene
over-cranked,

760
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:28,669
so in real life, you see everybody
running around looking completely normal,

761
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,212
but then to see it slow motion,

762
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:32,298
we'd watched it played
back on the little monitors.

763
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:34,150
I remember there was a big
conversation, because it was...

764
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:35,174
In the script,

765
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:38,554
it was a little flashback,
but when you boarded it out and budgeted,

766
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,222
- it was a big shoot.
- Yeah.

767
00:35:40,431 --> 00:35:43,976
So, it's a lesson when you look
at a script and there's, like, three lines

768
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,353
and it's a flashback,
and you think, "Oh, that's easy,"

769
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:49,565
but sometimes, it's a full day shoot.

770
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,126
- Yeah.
- And you get a little beat.

771
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,550
<i>I'm not a fancy dress kind of girl.</i>

772
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,696
Another great Miya moment.

773
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,741
Remember we didn't have
enough letters to peel off?

774
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:01,785
So, we couldn't really show him
scraping off letters,

775
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,389
- because there was one...
- Kept having to put them back on.

776
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,733
A little mishap.
They did not bring enough letters.

777
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:07,916
<i>No, no. It's, uh...</i>

778
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,543
Ooh! Ooh...

779
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:10,770
<i>It's been a while since I've seen...</i>

780
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:12,296
I just dropped something.

781
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,631
<i>Or anyone in a dress.</i>

782
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,861
<i>I feel like I should ask you to prom
or something.</i>

783
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:21,347
This was a nice little bit
of banter and actually is a nice set up...

784
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:25,017
for the ending, when she and he are alone.

785
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:27,061
I won't give the spoiler yet.

786
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,998
I'll assume people listening
to this have seen the movie.

787
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:32,983
Kramer is so snaky as a visualist

788
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:38,947
that he would compose these shots to have
that sunburst on the van behind the kids.

789
00:36:39,656 --> 00:36:41,551
Remember he...
And what was great about Kramer

790
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:45,621
is he would always beg for just one shot
where he could do something interesting...

791
00:36:45,746 --> 00:36:47,682
- He would say...
- Something special on his own,

792
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:48,999
and it was always worth it.

793
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,019
- He got some really beautiful shots...
- He did.

794
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:53,837
That were just all him
just saying, "Let me try something."

795
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,066
He would just lean in and say,
"I got a surprise for you".

796
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,484
- Yeah.
- And then he'd do something,

797
00:36:57,508 --> 00:36:59,635
and I'd be like, "Oh, man that's crazy!"

798
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:02,846
Yeah, he's definitely someone
we'd love to work with again.

799
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:04,472
Definitely.

800
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:06,242
Notice that we're
not really peeling letters off,

801
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,410
because we didn't have enough.

802
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,454
- Don't ruin the scene!
- Big studio movie!

803
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:10,872
Big studio movie,

804
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,040
but we didn't have enough letters.

805
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:14,000
We had, like, what,
three or four sets of letters?

806
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:15,418
No, we had like ten sets of letters,

807
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,242
- but we had, like, ten shots.
- Yeah.

808
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:21,073
And this was a scene that got changed.

809
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:24,451
It's exactly how it was, but in post,
it took on a different meaning

810
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:28,247
because it was just
a couple of parents leaving, and...

811
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:33,794
I don't know if it was you or Dean had
the idea to make it more of a threat...

812
00:37:33,877 --> 00:37:35,814
- It was Dean. Yeah.
- That they were skip tracers.

813
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:38,715
And it allows for a little bit
of a sense of the world.

814
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:41,009
One thing that was interesting
about this hotel

815
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:45,764
- is it was an occupied hotel at the time.
- Oh, I remember. That was... Yeah.

816
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:48,308
And there were people
looking out the window.

817
00:37:48,434 --> 00:37:50,662
We'd have to tell them,
"Could you not look out the window?

818
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:52,526
- "Because you're in the shot."
- Yeah.

819
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:56,984
I remember that day we got for craft
services, they brought Italian ices,

820
00:37:57,526 --> 00:38:00,529
which I think is probably the most
important story we could tell for this.

821
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,489
Italian ices were very nice.

822
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:04,467
Yeah, they were delicious
because it was hot.

823
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,243
Those are my drawings. I'm so proud.

824
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:07,578
I'm so proud.

825
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:10,557
You made it Jen.
You got your drawing in the movie.

826
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:13,834
I made it. I made my big break.
I've got drawings in the movie.

827
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:16,753
- But...
- And this was another great...

828
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,799
What we loved about the script is that
the friendship between the four of them

829
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:23,469
is really what this movie is about. Um...

830
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:31,185
And this was a real abandoned mall
in Atlanta, that little...

831
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:33,479
Dan, can I mention what else
was just recent? Okay.

832
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:36,482
We'll erase that bit. But...

833
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:39,485
This actually had
a much bigger set up.

834
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,111
We had to cut a lot of it out.

835
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:44,239
We had Chuck, the Czechoslovakian
wolf dog in this scene.

836
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:46,301
- He's still in it.
- I think he's still in it.

837
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:47,409
Yeah, no, he...

838
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,204
But there was more of him than...
He was an awesome dog.

839
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:53,099
- No one told Chuck he was cut.
- Wait, did we just talk over it?

840
00:38:53,123 --> 00:38:55,542
Yeah, he was in it a little bit.
He was a beautiful wolf dog.

841
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,086
And this was another just great moment.

842
00:38:58,212 --> 00:39:01,673
Kids being kids and forgetting
all the dangers in the world.

843
00:39:01,757 --> 00:39:06,261
Things they're on the run from and running
to that they can have a moment together.

844
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:10,015
And the pink bicycle that Ruby is...

845
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,451
And this was all improvised a lot.

846
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:15,604
All the playing around. They told them
to have fun, and they were able to do it.

847
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:19,083
That pink bike that she rides right
there is the one that we actually had

848
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,793
- on the side of the road.
- At the gas station?

849
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,528
So, she had a chance to practice.

850
00:39:22,611 --> 00:39:25,364
Yeah, and I said,
"Make sure we have it in the mall".

851
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:27,533
So we brought it in. It was great.

852
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,618
<i>Watership Down</i> book.

853
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,496
And look at the bokeh
on the back of that shot.

854
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:36,750
We shot this entire film in anamorphic,
which was actually very challenging,

855
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,169
'cause of all
the special effects involved.

856
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:44,424
The distortion is complicated
for a lot of VFX.

857
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:51,557
But it gives this warm, sort of
amazingly filmic look to the movie.

858
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:53,308
And a little nostalgic.

859
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:57,771
And it gives that sort of beautiful
bokeh on the back of those shots.

860
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:00,440
Now, this shot was done
with old-school wiring.

861
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:03,527
Yanking them up and down.

862
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,823
They were such troopers during this,
because we were yanking them up and down,

863
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,367
up and down, floor to ceiling, all day.

864
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,470
- It doesn't feel good.
- It does not feel good.

865
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:14,347
Although we constantly checked
with them to make sure they were okay.

866
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,331
And they were really...
They're good troopers.

867
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:19,209
They're indestructible
18-year-olds or 19-year-olds.

868
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,131
And I think later,
Harris said how, like...

869
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:27,593
he was sore from being held up in the air.

870
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:30,196
- Those harnesses don't feel great.
- They do not feel great.

871
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,100
And this is
our human bowling pin scene.

872
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:37,811
We had all this cool
camera rig set up in this.

873
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:42,190
We had this sort of aerial cam going on,
on a track.

874
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:45,485
We had... I think, one of the...

875
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:49,031
Am I crazy? Even though we were
inside, this was a night shoot?

876
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:51,366
I feel like I just remember...
Oh, we were there late.

877
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,290
It was a day shoot.
It's a night shoot...

878
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:57,623
Well, it's supposed to be set at night,
but we shot it during the day,

879
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:01,418
because we're dealing
with the constraints of shooting kids.

880
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:04,117
- Oh, right.
- At certain times of the day.

881
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:06,858
- A lot of the cast was younger.
- These were all our...

882
00:41:06,882 --> 00:41:08,717
The other kids were
all local casting, right?

883
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,095
A lot of them were,
but a lot of them weren't.

884
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:15,891
I mean, we actually lucked out with
who was available when and where.

885
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:18,310
<i>- And you can sleep here, tonight.
- What?</i>

886
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,645
<i>But only tonight.</i>

887
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,448
I remember we had
to do a very quick

888
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,815
wardrobe adjustment on their stuff

889
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:26,401
- like seconds before shooting.
- Seconds.

890
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:29,863
I remember they came to set
with things that didn't look quite right,

891
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:32,008
- and we had to race to fix it.
- It literally was in the hallway.

892
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:33,468
Yeah, it was literally
in the hallway.

893
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,345
And it's hard to comment
on an actors' clothing,

894
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:37,263
'cause you don't want them
to take it personally.

895
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:40,540
That's not their issue.
It's just a matter of on the day,

896
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:43,210
it doesn't look right on set,
you got to change stuff.

897
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:47,172
Again, the color.

898
00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:48,632
It's an abandoned mall.

899
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:51,468
It's at night.
It could have been really shabby.

900
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:56,264
But everywhere we could try
and find color, we'd put it in there.

901
00:41:57,808 --> 00:42:00,602
The fact that the little camp
fire light around them

902
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:03,021
puts on this red-orange glow...

903
00:42:06,441 --> 00:42:07,859
<i>Do you think that we've survived...</i>

904
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:09,653
Dystopia never look so pretty.

905
00:42:10,112 --> 00:42:12,531
<i>Look, we're not just
a bunch of dead weight.</i>

906
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,704
And we didn't have a lot of time
in the mall,

907
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:22,541
because we were also
setting up a lot of the stunt scenes

908
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,866
- for the second unit at the same time.
- Right.

909
00:42:25,544 --> 00:42:28,964
We had to book through
a lot of the shots of this.

910
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:32,551
And so, one of the things
that Kramer came up with was...

911
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,136
And it was odd, 'cause...

912
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:37,931
I remember shooting,
we were in the bottom level of this mall,

913
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:41,518
abandoned mall, so you could never
really tell if it was night or day,

914
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:43,413
- you just felt just...
- Yeah, but you had to book anyway.

915
00:42:43,437 --> 00:42:46,273
You only had a certain amount of time.

916
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,901
And Kramer was coming up with
this track system

917
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,786
so that we could get
a lot of rotating shots,

918
00:42:51,862 --> 00:42:53,947
a lot of coverage
of all these people talking.

919
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:56,324
It was a nightmare in the cutting room,

920
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:59,661
because you had to cut through
all these moving rotating shots.

921
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:03,790
But it allowed us to get
through the day quicker.

922
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,086
<i>We go to sleep.</i>

923
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:15,469
I was a big fan of that hoodie.
That was a big wardrobe success for us.

924
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,930
That was the first...
The red hoodie was the first.

925
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,432
This was the second.

926
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,200
I love this moment, by the way.

927
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:27,147
Having seen what happens when she...
has contact. The restraint.

928
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,399
Wanting to touch him,
but being afraid of it.

929
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:34,362
A lot of it's about that
visual hang time, right?

930
00:43:36,198 --> 00:43:37,282
<i>What are you doing?</i>

931
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:40,762
And no one's ever gonna
be able to unsee that,

932
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:44,831
but that little campfire makes a little
happy face in the background of that shot.

933
00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:45,916
Is that right?

934
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:48,019
Yeah, when he holds up the notebook
and there's a little happy face.

935
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:50,313
Wow, I didn't even know that.
Now I got to watch it again.

936
00:43:50,337 --> 00:43:52,380
Everyone in editorial was like,

937
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:55,091
"I can't unsee it now.
It's there forever."

938
00:43:57,093 --> 00:44:00,388
This is a scene that we really didn't
have that much time to get through.

939
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:02,700
- And so it was all Steadicam.
- Who did all those drawings?

940
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:05,769
- Was it the prop department?
- Yeah, the prop department.

941
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:09,356
I was really impressed with all...
A lot of work, to fill it up with code.

942
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:11,149
Oh, yeah.

943
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,404
I hope it all makes sense if people
freeze-frame and look at it.

944
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:19,324
- It's not like...
- No, we double-checked.

945
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:22,160
Oh, it does.
It all adds up. I checked.

946
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,122
What I also like
about Chubs a lot, too,

947
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:29,084
is even though he is the comedic relief,
he's also the skeptic.

948
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:34,005
He's the one who's
the least trusting of Ruby

949
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:36,633
when they first meet her, and, um...

950
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:40,720
You know, when they get to the camp
in the end, he's the same way there,

951
00:44:40,804 --> 00:44:43,890
and I think it's a really interesting
kind of character that way.

952
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,327
- I always loved this.
- And Skylan played it really well.

953
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:47,936
Yeah. I love that he's smart.

954
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:51,231
But he also has that,
as an actor, such a range.

955
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:54,568
And you can see that sensitivity
come through in moments like this.

956
00:44:56,653 --> 00:44:59,281
<i>My dad's a police detective, so...</i>

957
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:02,284
Yeah, this scene
was fast and furious.

958
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,330
But it turned out very simply.

959
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:09,749
Sometimes, when you're pushed to the limit

960
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:14,087
and you have to get things done
really fast, it comes out the best,

961
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:15,672
because you don't noodle stuff.

962
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:19,301
I also love scenes where the main
source of illumination is a flashlight.

963
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,552
- Yeah.
- Yep.

964
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:24,055
<i>Police talk to each other on frequencies
only they can listen to, like UHF, VHF.</i>

965
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,267
I love the fact
his eyes are glowing.

966
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:29,394
Yeah.

967
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,581
Yeah, that was a tough one
to figure out, because he has...

968
00:45:31,605 --> 00:45:33,940
His powers are the least external,

969
00:45:34,149 --> 00:45:38,153
So we had to decide, "Okay,
when is he thinking super-intelligently",

970
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:39,404
versus just thinking?"

971
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:43,116
How do you visualize his mind
racing and his superpower happening?

972
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:44,450
It's pretty great.

973
00:45:45,285 --> 00:45:49,581
And I just love the fact it looks
like an animal in the night.

974
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:50,999
<i>Five, four, zero.</i>

975
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:53,627
<i>Okay, got it.</i>

976
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:56,480
This took some fancy footwork,
trying to get the shot right.

977
00:45:56,504 --> 00:46:00,133
I'm also thinking we probably did
too few cranks on that recharger,

978
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:02,153
'cause I don't think it would work
after two or three.

979
00:46:02,177 --> 00:46:03,177
It's not accurate!

980
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:06,556
If we could redo it, I would
have him crank it for 20, 30 minutes.

981
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,059
Reshoots!

982
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,603
Or it's just a great radio.

983
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:15,523
That voice is
Dean Zimmerman's daughter.

984
00:46:15,732 --> 00:46:17,084
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

985
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:21,613
<i>Charles!</i>

986
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:23,341
That's one of those things, like,

987
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:25,405
"Who are we gonna get to do that?
Oh, let's just..."

988
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:29,579
Super cute.

989
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:33,166
But that moment when they smile
at each other, I just love that.

990
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:37,337
<i>So, we're gonna
take the next exit, and...</i>

991
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:40,382
So much of this movie
was happening in that van.

992
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:45,053
And you wouldn't know it,
but that's all screen. They're in the van.

993
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:48,807
Yeah, most of the
van scenes were on-stage.

994
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:52,060
Other than the big chase sequences,
which were real.

995
00:46:53,353 --> 00:46:57,857
Trying to get it to look natural,
but at the same time, practical.

996
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:04,781
The under bridge... We went through
so many bridges trying to find a bridge.

997
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:05,740
I remember.

998
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:09,369
And we went to a bridge
that probably was more cool as a bridge,

999
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:13,331
but it looked so dystopianly,
desperately sad.

1000
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,168
And this bridge was actually
really pretty in a nice neighborhood,

1001
00:47:17,711 --> 00:47:21,214
and we had to go and mess
it up really badly.

1002
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:22,507
Yeah.

1003
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:25,111
Neighbors were probably wondering
why we were schlepping all this stuff.

1004
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:27,071
We had a big rain storm.
I don't know if it was this scene, or...

1005
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:28,239
- It was.
- Yeah, where...

1006
00:47:28,263 --> 00:47:31,558
I wanted one more shot, and I was,
like, desperate for that one more shot,

1007
00:47:31,641 --> 00:47:35,729
and then there was
this complete flood of just...

1008
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:38,082
Luckily, everyone was able
to jam under the bridge.

1009
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:41,609
So, you had an entire cast and crew of
a movie under the bridge, waiting it out.

1010
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:45,613
It was very, very fortuitous,
'cause we shot this at the same time

1011
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,699
we shot the Lady Jane scene as well.

1012
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:49,324
Right.

1013
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:53,163
'Cause again, as people
who make movies would know,

1014
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:55,999
but people who maybe
don't make movies don't know,

1015
00:47:56,124 --> 00:47:58,209
we have to shoot
all these things out of order.

1016
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:02,047
Yeah, I remember
when I first started doing this,

1017
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:04,924
that was something I just
never thought of. "Oh, that's right."

1018
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,887
You don't film a movie
in the order that it's written.

1019
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:10,972
"You have to group shots together."

1020
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,601
That's something that we don't
have to worry about in animation,

1021
00:48:14,726 --> 00:48:18,354
'cause the set is in a computer somewhere.
We just open up the file.

1022
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:25,612
But, yeah, going physically
to a location is quite a lot of work.

1023
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:29,115
Like this. This was our
opening scene when she was younger.

1024
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:32,494
This was Amandla's
first day of shoot.

1025
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:33,995
And a tough scene too.

1026
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,759
Yeah, it was... Oh, yeah,
this is the hardest emotional scene,

1027
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:39,459
where you have to bawl
and see your parents for the first time.

1028
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:43,004
And it was the first day
she was physically on set.

1029
00:48:43,797 --> 00:48:46,049
But she said it was very helpful for her,

1030
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,052
'cause it allowed her to know
kind of the stakes

1031
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:54,557
of what she was going home for emotionally
to be able to carry that with her.

1032
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:57,393
Whenever she's thinking about her parents,
she was thinking about

1033
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:59,020
what was going on in this scene.

1034
00:48:59,145 --> 00:49:00,425
<i>They lost their daughter.</i>

1035
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:05,360
And we thought of planning this
as full-on real-time, but it just...

1036
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:07,529
It didn't come off right.

1037
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:09,405
No, I feel... She's on a journey.

1038
00:49:09,489 --> 00:49:11,658
We couldn't put the brakes
on the movie for that long.

1039
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,285
But it feels like we got
the emotion out of that.

1040
00:49:14,494 --> 00:49:17,614
- Seeing it more from her point of view.
- What's great about it too is

1041
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,999
- it's her realizing that Liam was right.
- Right.

1042
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,019
- There is no going home.
- Yeah.

1043
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:23,771
And then this was one
of those great finds.

1044
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:25,773
This was one of my favorite scenes,
this shot.

1045
00:49:25,797 --> 00:49:27,549
- A DP's dream.
- Yep.

1046
00:49:27,799 --> 00:49:31,678
- I love the flag in the background.
- This is such a beautiful location.

1047
00:49:32,137 --> 00:49:35,807
It was completely natural.
All we did was bring those two little...

1048
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,643
The flag and the two little
old goalposts in the background.

1049
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,728
And we just stuck it in
the middle of this field.

1050
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:43,064
Such beautiful color.

1051
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:47,837
This to me is some of my favorite
stuff from Harris in the movie here.

1052
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:50,113
- Just very delicate.
- Yeah.

1053
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,241
It was one of those dangerous things
in post.

1054
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:57,537
We recut this 50 thousand times,
this scene,

1055
00:49:57,662 --> 00:50:00,707
subtly taking a frame here
or a frame there out.

1056
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:04,169
And every time we changed it, it died.

1057
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:07,172
It got worse, and so we'd
have to put it back.

1058
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:08,255
Mm.

1059
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:10,442
Because of the subtlety,
as you're talking about.

1060
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:12,653
There's a purity to it.
You can't sacrifice that.

1061
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:15,489
We're very lucky, you never can
know this early that your actors

1062
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:18,183
are gonna have chemistry,
but they were so great together.

1063
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,895
Yeah, they're friends.
They're just really good friends.

1064
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:26,900
That sort of warmth,
the fondness, really comes through.

1065
00:50:27,901 --> 00:50:33,364
I think it was Harris' dancing
on set that really won Amandla over early.

1066
00:50:33,615 --> 00:50:35,759
Yeah, the first day they met,
literally the first day they met,

1067
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,203
they'd never set eyes
on each other before,

1068
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:42,081
and they walked into the room
and they're just running a scene together

1069
00:50:42,207 --> 00:50:45,543
to see what they would be like together,
and at one point Harris,

1070
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:49,589
in between doing things or reading lines,
they started dancing.

1071
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:51,953
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, ballroom dancing together.

1072
00:50:53,176 --> 00:50:56,221
And it was so sort of goofy and so sweet,

1073
00:50:56,346 --> 00:50:58,946
- and instantly, everybody in the room...
- Bonding, yeah.

1074
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:02,393
We felt like we were watching
some rare occurrence

1075
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:04,729
among wild animals
in the wilderness.

1076
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,540
Like, "Oh, my gosh, I can't believe
we caught that moment."

1077
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:10,151
- "It's so beautiful and rare."
- This is a great moment.

1078
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:12,153
Sort of a near-kiss.
She wants connection,

1079
00:51:12,278 --> 00:51:14,739
but she's afraid of what happens
when she has it.

1080
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:19,261
That's' why all those scenes
were in color.

1081
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:22,789
We had to cut down on
how pretty that shot was

1082
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:26,376
'cause it was so pretty that it
was almost fairy tale pretty,

1083
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:29,087
so we had to de-prettify it
just a hair in color.

1084
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,170
Yeah.

1085
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:34,175
<i>Till then, Zu saved some Twinkies for you.</i>

1086
00:51:34,259 --> 00:51:37,220
We didn't get a good product deal
with Twinkies, did we?

1087
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:39,138
Did we get any
free Twinkies out of this.

1088
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:40,991
- I don't remember having it.
- I don't think we did.

1089
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:45,395
I think the last day, Björn Mayer,
the VFX sup, was working,

1090
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:48,565
we said, "The last day you're working,
you're gonna have to eat a Twinkie"

1091
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,366
for the very first time,"
'cause he's German.

1092
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:53,173
- He said he would eat one?
- He didn't eat one.

1093
00:51:53,528 --> 00:51:55,288
- But we wanted to. I did.
- You did.

1094
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:57,281
They're good.

1095
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:59,075
<i>Can hear frequencies that adults can't.</i>

1096
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:02,392
<i>There is some good in getting old...</i>

1097
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:04,080
This was an awesome moment.

1098
00:52:05,665 --> 00:52:11,170
We had a lot of last-minute work
on the sort of noise gun attachment.

1099
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:13,641
Again, going for
the real, but also...

1100
00:52:13,715 --> 00:52:17,218
Yeah, the earlier versions
looked a little too much like a toy.

1101
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:22,140
And the visual effect of the ripple
in the air,

1102
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:24,976
again, going for a real effect, versus...

1103
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:28,855
'Cause statically,
it doesn't look as cool.

1104
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:32,042
<i>Considering I'm the one with the gun,
I think I'm gonna pass.</i>

1105
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:34,235
This is an actual working bridge

1106
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:37,905
that had a ton of cars
trafficking over it all the time.

1107
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:42,493
And it was such a challenge not to get
either traffic or people honking,

1108
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:45,788
- because traffic was stopped.
- Right. We were causing traffic.

1109
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:50,209
This was a visual that,
when I first heard Gwendoline

1110
00:52:50,293 --> 00:52:51,711
was gonna do the movie,

1111
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:55,923
I was so excited about this setup,
because Amandla is...

1112
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:58,926
That shot right there.
Amandla is a very petite person.

1113
00:52:59,052 --> 00:53:00,720
- Yeah.
- She's very petite,

1114
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:03,765
and Gwendoline is very, very tall.

1115
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:06,368
- And the image of her...
- She's at least a foot taller.

1116
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:11,606
Yeah, and the image of her kneeling
and Ruby being in charge of that dynamic

1117
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:14,359
was just really exciting.

1118
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:16,337
I always love this beat.
It's so chilling.

1119
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:17,236
Yep.

1120
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,865
'Cause I remember at,
whether during script stage,

1121
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:23,201
they're like, "Wait,
so she just walks until she dies?"

1122
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:24,924
- Yep.
- We're like, "Yeah!"

1123
00:53:24,952 --> 00:53:27,181
- Like, "Wow, that's pretty rough!"
- She keeps going, yeah.

1124
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:28,623
I thought that just...

1125
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,001
That shows how serious
she is about it.

1126
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:36,130
Yeah, it leaves it open
for the sequel

1127
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:40,385
for Lady Jane to just walk into frame
looking very hungry.

1128
00:53:44,097 --> 00:53:45,097
Oh, man.

1129
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,141
You know, this is
the moment when...

1130
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:50,812
her friends see
how powerful she really is.

1131
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,623
- Or realize she's an orange.
- Yeah.

1132
00:53:52,647 --> 00:53:54,899
Until then, she was
telling them she was a green.

1133
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:57,294
- This is also another great scene.
- This is great.

1134
00:53:57,318 --> 00:54:00,196
This location is actually literally
across a little service road

1135
00:54:00,279 --> 00:54:02,679
- from the scene in the meadow.
- In the field, yeah.

1136
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:07,453
And it's the other view.
It's a beautiful location. Um...

1137
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:11,374
And our camera puller...
Before I even talk about that,

1138
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,209
I've cut that part out.

1139
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:18,297
But this scene was when, in between takes,
the kids were all sitting around

1140
00:54:18,423 --> 00:54:22,093
and just sort of playing
instruments in between takes.

1141
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:24,321
I remember they sent us a song.
They cut, like, a little CD of it.

1142
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:26,824
- Yeah, they did. It's really great.
- It's floating around in my car.

1143
00:54:26,848 --> 00:54:28,492
I was like,
"Wow, that's really great."

1144
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:30,977
They're so talented as musicians,
on top of everything else.

1145
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:32,862
That light,
I remember, I actually...

1146
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:33,938
It's amazing.

1147
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:35,958
Fracturing through the trees,
was so beautiful.

1148
00:54:35,982 --> 00:54:39,193
This was where they were
playing music around the campfire.

1149
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:41,779
It was so great. We just let them go
and keep going,

1150
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:45,158
and I think John Starke came over
and just sort of nudged over,

1151
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:47,994
he said, "So, what's going on?"

1152
00:54:48,077 --> 00:54:52,206
Because as the UPM,
he was making sure things moved along,

1153
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:55,835
but we just loved
watching them play for a while.

1154
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:59,273
It's good bonding moments
when you can get that off-camera,

1155
00:54:59,297 --> 00:55:01,299
where your actors really like each other.

1156
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:02,507
Yeah.

1157
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:07,638
But this location was the one where...

1158
00:55:08,556 --> 00:55:11,976
I think one of the signs
that I realized that

1159
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:16,105
things were gonna be okay on set
and people didn't hate me

1160
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:21,694
was this location was filled with spiders
and all sorts of critters underfoot.

1161
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,547
Is this when they laid
a mat down for you?

1162
00:55:23,571 --> 00:55:25,811
They laid a little furni pad
under my chair for me.

1163
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:27,759
Everyone liked you, Jen.
You never needed to worry.

1164
00:55:27,783 --> 00:55:31,829
- But that was a sign of...
- I was like, "Aw, that's so sweet!"

1165
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:36,042
And Steve, the script supervisor's
so happy,

1166
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:38,544
'cause he sat right next to me,
so he got the mat too.

1167
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:40,858
<i>- Let's go!
- Yeah. We're not far now.</i>

1168
00:55:40,922 --> 00:55:41,964
<i>Hey, Zu!</i>

1169
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:43,716
<i>We're packing up.</i>

1170
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:45,968
<i>Gotta go.</i>

1171
00:55:46,052 --> 00:55:47,652
Yeah, this location was so pretty.

1172
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,804
<i>Try and run away again.</i>

1173
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:50,223
Again, so green.

1174
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:52,892
And this was nice to have,
a moment of some comedy,

1175
00:55:52,975 --> 00:55:54,352
some lightheartedness.

1176
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:59,190
And Kramer really worked
to get the mist perfect.

1177
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,817
- Yeah.
- In between pranking people

1178
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:03,778
with pickles, he worked
very hard on the mist.

1179
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:04,946
Yes, he did.

1180
00:56:06,739 --> 00:56:07,823
<i>Blaze of glory.</i>

1181
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:09,033
And this van.

1182
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,136
Since this is the last time
we're gonna be seeing it,

1183
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,995
it was just nice just to see it

1184
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,681
in the sort of
idyllic beautiful resting place.

1185
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:16,825
- It's a character in the movie.
- Yeah.

1186
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,811
We spent a lot of time trying
to figure out what song to play here.

1187
00:56:19,835 --> 00:56:21,939
This is one of the better
song cues of the movie, I think, too.

1188
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:23,965
- This is a great one.
- Yeah.

1189
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,527
I think, Dan, this is
what you listen to

1190
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:27,569
when you're doing Pilates, right?

1191
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,512
Yep. That's where we got it from.

1192
00:56:31,013 --> 00:56:32,223
The old Pilates mix.

1193
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:36,954
And this was great.
I remember just...

1194
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:40,565
We kind of randomly picked up shots,
and this was where Kramer, our DP,

1195
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,567
was hanging off the back of a golf cart.

1196
00:56:42,692 --> 00:56:46,195
- Trying to get a golden hour...
- Yeah, as the sun was going down.

1197
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,881
- Yeah.
- And then we also had

1198
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:51,409
some drone shots going here,
and I think a drone crashed at one point.

1199
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:54,328
- Well, it landed hard but was fine.
- Yeah.

1200
00:56:54,495 --> 00:56:57,456
It's always fun when you're
trying to beat sunset capture stuff.

1201
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,416
That's all practical.

1202
00:56:58,499 --> 00:57:00,561
- End up with moments like that.
- Some flares.

1203
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:02,795
- Yeah.
- All that's real, practical.

1204
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:05,673
And this is
in Stone Mountain in Atlanta.

1205
00:57:05,756 --> 00:57:07,633
Real train tracks.
We didn't pay for those.

1206
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,303
No, we built those from scratch.

1207
00:57:11,137 --> 00:57:13,097
Well, we built the EDO from scratch.

1208
00:57:13,306 --> 00:57:15,766
And then we had a lot
of conversations about,

1209
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:17,852
"How do we make this EDO look...

1210
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,896
recognizable, but not too obvious?"

1211
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,166
And there was a conversation
about how many rocks should go in the E.

1212
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,318
You came over to me
looking really worried,

1213
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:27,838
and I know that when you come over
looking really worried you said,

1214
00:57:27,862 --> 00:57:29,447
"Jen, the E."

1215
00:57:29,697 --> 00:57:31,907
So, we were moving
the rocks around on the E.

1216
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:34,952
It was so perfect, that it made
it seem like, "How could you miss"

1217
00:57:35,036 --> 00:57:37,371
this clue to the secret camp?
Everyone would be there."

1218
00:57:37,747 --> 00:57:39,040
Oh, dear.

1219
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:40,726
<i>- Hey, we're not armed.
- Save it, asshole.</i>

1220
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:41,626
<i>Hold on.</i>

1221
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:45,755
This scene actually was about
100 and something degrees.

1222
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,524
- Yes.
- A very, very hot day.

1223
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:49,634
It was crazy hot.

1224
00:57:49,759 --> 00:57:51,879
Feel bad from the soldiers
in multiple layers.

1225
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:54,263
And out on that bleaching rock too.

1226
00:57:54,347 --> 00:57:55,467
- Yep.
- Yep.

1227
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,600
But this is an old rock quarry,

1228
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:00,603
and that was actually
the way the rock looks.

1229
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:02,980
- Mm-hmm.
- It had an interesting

1230
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:04,523
sort of stark look to it

1231
00:58:04,649 --> 00:58:08,069
that was different from
the actual main body of the kids' camp.

1232
00:58:08,194 --> 00:58:09,862
<i>I told you, man, you...</i>

1233
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,993
This was probably
our biggest set, right?

1234
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:17,328
Yes, the camp.

1235
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:22,375
Um... The most constructed,
the most scale, the most extras.

1236
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:26,504
Every day, we had 300 kids running around.
Right? 300, I think.

1237
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:28,815
Yeah, the kids were great.
They were so enthusiastic,

1238
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,425
were happy to do the same things
over and over and over.

1239
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:33,153
And there are places in this camp...

1240
00:58:33,177 --> 00:58:35,888
Russell's funny,
our production designer's funny.

1241
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:40,017
He likes to get all outdoorsy
and build stuff.

1242
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:43,396
And a lot of the places in this camp
are places you can actually hang out,

1243
00:58:43,479 --> 00:58:47,233
and in between, you'd find set members,
cast members or crew members

1244
00:58:47,525 --> 00:58:50,486
hanging out in some of these places.
They're actually comfortable.

1245
00:58:50,611 --> 00:58:53,781
Yeah, the treehouse.
This is the great Paddy Gibson.

1246
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:57,660
First time we're seeing Paddy
in person rather than a flashback.

1247
00:58:58,035 --> 00:58:59,035
Exactly.

1248
00:58:59,078 --> 00:59:01,163
<i>I knew you weren't reformed.</i>

1249
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:05,668
And this office of his,
on top of a water tower,

1250
00:59:06,293 --> 00:59:09,672
again, every single set in this place
you could just hang out in.

1251
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:12,717
- Yeah.
- This was all... This was inside.

1252
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:17,471
This was on a stage, just the interior
of this... Of his little lair.

1253
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:23,602
Everything you see outside
is obviously out on a real location.

1254
00:59:23,686 --> 00:59:25,312
<i>You're kinda legendary.</i>

1255
00:59:25,396 --> 00:59:26,480
Yeah, this one...

1256
00:59:26,564 --> 00:59:29,108
And he does a great
American accent, I think...

1257
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,911
Paddy really is
an incredible actor.

1258
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:32,878
- Yeah.
- Great in <i>The OA.</i>

1259
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,114
Yeah, he was
the best thing in <i>The OA.</i>

1260
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:38,951
Just saw a new movie he was in
called <i>In a Relationship</i> that he was...

1261
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:41,370
He stole that movie. He's wonderful.

1262
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:46,459
He's also very interesting
and subtle in what he does.

1263
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:47,710
Yeah, agreed.

1264
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:49,604
Yeah, he took a good approach
to this character.

1265
00:59:49,628 --> 00:59:51,606
He played it real, as opposed
to mustache-twirling.

1266
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:54,310
In <i>The OA,</i> he plays a bully
that you feel bad for, you know.

1267
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:57,762
- Dan, want to talk about the song?
- How did we find this song, Dan?

1268
00:59:58,179 --> 00:59:59,180
Pilates Mix?

1269
00:59:59,388 --> 01:00:01,599
Also on the Pilates mix.

1270
01:00:02,141 --> 01:00:05,060
Uh... I mean, obviously, this is...
We are six years in the future,

1271
01:00:05,186 --> 01:00:07,938
so you want this to be
a relatively recent song,

1272
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:13,194
but you know, I was on the set
with Jen, I think,

1273
01:00:13,736 --> 01:00:15,738
- days before this shot.
- Yeah.

1274
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:18,866
And this was an ongoing
conversation, and I was...

1275
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:23,412
I've always just loved this album
<i>In Colour</i> by Jamie xx

1276
01:00:23,496 --> 01:00:25,331
who's the DJ of The xx.

1277
01:00:25,831 --> 01:00:30,795
And this song in particular
that I feel really speaks to the moment.

1278
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:36,258
I remember you picked it.
Every cue on this movie changed,

1279
01:00:36,425 --> 01:00:40,054
but this song we always fought to keep,
because it just felt perfection,

1280
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:42,848
and we didn't... We always told
everyone, "No, this song stays."

1281
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:45,327
Yeah, you literally leaned over
with your phone and you said,

1282
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:46,411
"How's this?", and you played it.

1283
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:49,271
And I said, "That's great!
We're gonna use it!"

1284
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:52,942
Here it is by the way.
I mean, this is just magic.

1285
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,087
I remember when we read it in the script
for the first time, whenever that was,

1286
01:00:56,111 --> 01:00:58,781
being like, "Awesome."
But then seeing it happen...

1287
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,950
I mean, her look obviously sells it too,

1288
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:06,455
but it's just that natural use
of the powers where it's done out of love.

1289
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:08,374
- It's a loving gesture.
- Right.

1290
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:12,211
It's funny, when we shot
that scene practically with a wire,

1291
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:15,256
with him lassoing her
out to the dance floor, I...

1292
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:17,734
In the back of my head, I did not...
I wasn't sure it was gonna work.

1293
01:01:17,758 --> 01:01:19,552
I thought, "Is this too silly?"

1294
01:01:19,677 --> 01:01:21,887
But it's actually really romantic
and sweet.

1295
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:24,473
And it works great.
But at the time, I was a little nervous.

1296
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,826
Yeah, 'cause it's thrown away.

1297
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:29,270
If it was a big thing, it would be silly,
but it's the fact it's thrown away.

1298
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:32,606
It's just a little practical
gesture of, "Go on."

1299
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:35,526
And people do all sorts of silly things
on a dance floor in real life.

1300
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:38,863
No, and also on this movie,
I remember that when you're doing

1301
01:01:38,946 --> 01:01:40,948
these movies, you're working
with a lot of extras,

1302
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,409
and some of them are not as good
dancers as you hoped,

1303
01:01:43,492 --> 01:01:45,470
and you have to sort of gently
push them to the background

1304
01:01:45,494 --> 01:01:48,622
and pull up the people
who can dance, and...

1305
01:01:48,706 --> 01:01:51,000
I was actually really worried about
the dance scene,

1306
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:54,962
because I can't dance worth anything.
I'm really bad.

1307
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:56,547
I'm remedial.

1308
01:01:56,922 --> 01:02:00,175
And so, I was really worried about...
And I don't go to dances.

1309
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:02,779
- I think I stayed home for prom.
- Have to get you out of the house.

1310
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:06,640
I remember what happened was
we got a bunch of professional dancers,

1311
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:09,768
but also there were background actors
that we were gonna use,

1312
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:12,897
and it was almost like
a very quick dance-off

1313
01:02:13,022 --> 01:02:15,608
where people just started dancing,
and we slowly pulled...

1314
01:02:15,691 --> 01:02:18,319
It was like picking
the baseball team in summer camp.

1315
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:19,403
It was very funny.

1316
01:02:19,695 --> 01:02:21,923
- Yeah. It ended up being...
- They look great in that scene.

1317
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:25,284
This is a scene where there was
an iconic moment from the book

1318
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:27,053
that we ended up cutting
'cause it didn't work.

1319
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:29,077
Is this the...
Did we initially have the rose here?

1320
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:31,724
We had the rose scene when
they first arrived in the room.

1321
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:33,560
- And we actually shot it.
- Oh, then he puts it into her...

1322
01:02:33,584 --> 01:02:34,936
We shot the whole
rose giving scene.

1323
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,146
We spent a lot of time
on that shot.

1324
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:37,087
We did.

1325
01:02:37,171 --> 01:02:39,924
And getting the look of it right
and getting the perfect rose for it.

1326
01:02:40,132 --> 01:02:41,425
And everything.

1327
01:02:42,051 --> 01:02:46,430
And it ended up being a major telegraph
of, oh, he's a bad guy.

1328
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:49,016
Because it's creepy.

1329
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:52,579
- It is a creepy thing for him to do.
- Yeah, it didn't occur to me

1330
01:02:52,603 --> 01:02:54,730
when we had it
that that might be taken that way.

1331
01:02:54,939 --> 01:02:57,859
But we kept it in as long as we could
'cause I do remember our writer Chad

1332
01:02:57,942 --> 01:03:01,320
telling us how iconic that moment was.
This was great too.

1333
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:03,423
<i>My father didn't care,
he sanctioned it.</i>

1334
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:05,240
Uh, I remember,
even though it's just

1335
01:03:05,366 --> 01:03:08,577
little quick cuts of it,
that Paddy was so great.

1336
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:11,497
His anguish and betrayal
of his father and...

1337
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,290
Yeah, his last day on set.

1338
01:03:13,374 --> 01:03:15,876
And he got a bouquet of orange flowers...

1339
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,938
I have a great a photo of
him holding his bouquet.

1340
01:03:17,962 --> 01:03:19,481
I got to give it to him at some point.

1341
01:03:19,505 --> 01:03:21,345
What's great too
is you see him briefly

1342
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:22,776
in the opening in this same scene,

1343
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,969
but now you're getting his version of it.
You know?

1344
01:03:25,052 --> 01:03:26,679
<i>If he knows we can't be fixed...</i>

1345
01:03:26,762 --> 01:03:29,056
<i>They'll never stop trying to fix us.</i>

1346
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:30,015
<i>Why?</i>

1347
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,517
<i>Because he's afraid of us.</i>

1348
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,680
But he's so intense here
which is really great.

1349
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:37,815
But you feel
the hurt in his voice.

1350
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:38,816
- Yeah.
- Yup.

1351
01:03:38,899 --> 01:03:42,987
And so it makes him
really likeable and relatable.

1352
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:45,990
'Cause Paddy's such a great actor.

1353
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:50,369
He can make someone that could have come
off as being, sort of, straight evil.

1354
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:53,872
No, it wasn't a ton to work with
in the script.

1355
01:03:53,956 --> 01:03:56,417
And not the fault of
the script just the role.

1356
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,751
And he made the most of it.

1357
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,046
<i>And I won't hurt anyone?</i>

1358
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:04,717
Amandla's so great with
what she could do with her eyes and...

1359
01:04:07,678 --> 01:04:08,595
<i>Teach me.</i>

1360
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:09,879
"Teach me." I love that.

1361
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:12,641
<i>Everyone has a place
in the world.</i>

1362
01:04:14,059 --> 01:04:16,061
<i>A responsibility, a purpose.</i>

1363
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:20,149
We really lucked out with rain too
'cause this whole set,

1364
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:22,651
at one point it became a mud pit.

1365
01:04:22,735 --> 01:04:24,629
We were not there later,
but we didn't luck out with rain

1366
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:25,863
because we got rained out.

1367
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:30,951
That thing turned into a swamp in
later night scenes which we'll get to.

1368
01:04:31,035 --> 01:04:33,620
I got to learn how
to wear galoshes properly.

1369
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,349
- They were mud.
- We had some torrential downpours.

1370
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:38,042
I'm amazed we actually finished.

1371
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:39,125
<i>Focus.</i>

1372
01:04:39,168 --> 01:04:44,465
This scene, the fact it's montaged
is actually really helpful.

1373
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:47,718
Originally, it wasn't.
We shot it all as separate scenes.

1374
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:51,430
And the hope was to eventually montage it,

1375
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:53,849
but it never quite got there.

1376
01:04:54,058 --> 01:04:57,186
You and Dean did a lot
of magic tricks in the movie,

1377
01:04:57,394 --> 01:05:00,290
but this might have been one of the more
impressive ones. What you did here.

1378
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:02,441
This is basically post magic.

1379
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:08,113
Because Dean came up with how to
cut this in a way that really felt great.

1380
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:09,364
Yeah.

1381
01:05:09,448 --> 01:05:12,618
And it, we even used
little outtakes and stuff.

1382
01:05:12,785 --> 01:05:15,954
Little things in there that
made things a little bit happier,

1383
01:05:16,038 --> 01:05:19,666
brighter, seeing their relationship
progress over the course of it.

1384
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,126
But also kept the momentum going.

1385
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:26,465
Because when we had it not a montage,
it really drove down the energy.

1386
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,926
No, this was a...
I remember in the early days,

1387
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:32,096
it was a real challenge this scene.
It wasn't working.

1388
01:05:32,346 --> 01:05:35,516
And felt a lot of different things
competing, a little clunky.

1389
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,935
But this really pushed
it all along nicely.

1390
01:05:38,018 --> 01:05:39,061
Yeah.

1391
01:05:39,311 --> 01:05:40,771
<i>You need to be stronger.</i>

1392
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:43,649
And those bottles.

1393
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:46,777
That sort of enclosure
around the plants back there.

1394
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:48,153
That's a Russell special.

1395
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:51,508
This is, I think,
is gonna be the most informational

1396
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:53,742
and educational moment
in the film for everyone.

1397
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:57,579
Anyone, anyone interested
in peppers is gonna learn a lot right now.

1398
01:05:57,746 --> 01:06:00,874
I learned about peppers.
I didn't know about that.

1399
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:04,318
A lot of people didn't. I'm trying
to remember when I knew that was the case.

1400
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:08,715
Probably when I first read the script.
I mean, the book or...

1401
01:06:14,012 --> 01:06:15,180
<i>You're right.</i>

1402
01:06:16,557 --> 01:06:18,517
I love the look on his face,
that's great.

1403
01:06:18,851 --> 01:06:20,602
<i>We need all the Vitamin C we can get.</i>

1404
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:27,322
But this is towards
the end of the shoot.

1405
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:30,086
We had, um... This is probably
the last couple of weeks of shoot.

1406
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:33,073
It started getting really hot and humid
out in Atlanta.

1407
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:34,741
Oh, yeah.

1408
01:06:35,659 --> 01:06:38,370
- Atlanta in the summer is not easy.
- Yeah.

1409
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:42,499
Although we luckily wrapped
in June before it got really intense.

1410
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:46,378
But it was definitely... humid.

1411
01:06:46,461 --> 01:06:47,504
<i>What happened?</i>

1412
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:50,299
<i>I've never told anyone.</i>

1413
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:53,427
I think there was a photograph
of the two of them

1414
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,904
sitting and figuring this thing out.

1415
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:57,764
And I'm literally sitting between them
on the sofa staring.

1416
01:06:57,848 --> 01:06:59,975
I felt like I was in some
sort of therapy session.

1417
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:01,058
Yeah.

1418
01:07:01,935 --> 01:07:06,273
But Liam looking through the window
and seeing the two of them together...

1419
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:07,357
<i>It's okay.</i>

1420
01:07:07,733 --> 01:07:10,110
That's really, it's so sad.

1421
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:13,405
He's very sad in this scene.

1422
01:07:13,488 --> 01:07:14,489
Yeah.

1423
01:07:14,823 --> 01:07:17,326
They're connecting in a way
he can't connect with her.

1424
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:18,659
Yet.

1425
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:21,222
And there's nothing
he can do about it.

1426
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:24,416
There's no way he can share
what these two can share.

1427
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:30,714
And that's the way the villain can
insinuate himself into Ruby's life

1428
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:33,175
because he can offer something Liam can't.

1429
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:37,679
Yeah, here's our sort of fading
smoke effect which took a long time

1430
01:07:37,763 --> 01:07:40,974
to figure out how it should look,
and we're thrilled with how it turned out.

1431
01:07:41,058 --> 01:07:43,018
It was a long development process.

1432
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:45,896
Remember it was
like computerized, like Matrixy.

1433
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:47,123
- Yeah.
- Early days.

1434
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:48,732
It just didn't have the emotion to it.

1435
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:53,779
Björn was trying to find a look
that was natural and emotional.

1436
01:07:53,862 --> 01:07:54,862
Right.

1437
01:07:54,905 --> 01:07:57,866
And I think
what he finally settled on was

1438
01:07:58,033 --> 01:08:00,077
the effect of ink in water dissipating.

1439
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:02,955
<i>Just a little kid.
I had no clue what I was doing.</i>

1440
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,541
I love effects like that.

1441
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:10,045
The kind that you look at and go,
I haven't seen that before done like that.

1442
01:08:10,212 --> 01:08:11,296
Mm-hmm.

1443
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:16,093
I think early on we were also trying to
do something so groundbreaking

1444
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:20,138
and never seen before that it got too
complicated and really we needed something

1445
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:22,057
elegant and simple and sad.

1446
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:23,701
It's that stereotypical thing,
you walk in and say,

1447
01:08:23,725 --> 01:08:25,536
"I want something
that's never been seen before."

1448
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,704
I want something completely new.

1449
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:29,408
Then you look at 20 things
and you're like I don't like any of this.

1450
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,668
Let's just go back
to the first thing we had

1451
01:08:31,692 --> 01:08:32,752
that seems to work pretty well.

1452
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:35,320
Let's go back to the simple thing.
Ink in water.

1453
01:08:40,993 --> 01:08:43,620
It's actually one of the things
I'm obsessed with too. Because...

1454
01:08:43,704 --> 01:08:46,081
- Ink in water?
- Ink in water.

1455
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:48,166
But living water color paintings and stuff

1456
01:08:48,292 --> 01:08:51,461
is something that I was interested
in doing before.

1457
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:56,466
And to see it happen here visually
on a live action shot is pretty amazing.

1458
01:08:57,592 --> 01:08:58,592
<i>Intense.</i>

1459
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:04,683
I love the fact there's details
in here that really we didn't have to do.

1460
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:05,851
But Russell put in there.

1461
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,479
This tent was originally just a tent.

1462
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:12,816
Like a military surplus tent
in the script.

1463
01:09:13,317 --> 01:09:16,820
And the fact that it became this
sort of bohemian place

1464
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:18,655
you'd really want to hang out in.

1465
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:23,744
Remember, we hired Russell off of,
or Rusty as he prefers to be called,

1466
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,930
- off of <i>Captain Fantastic.</i>
<i>- Captain Fantastic.</i>

1467
01:09:25,954 --> 01:09:30,292
Which had that real lived in feel.

1468
01:09:30,459 --> 01:09:31,501
Real lived in, yeah.

1469
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:34,546
It was a perfect correlation
to what we needed in our film.

1470
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:37,049
I remember we said,
Jen, go check out...

1471
01:09:37,591 --> 01:09:41,219
It wasn't even... I think it was just,
you got to see <i>Captain Fantastic.</i>

1472
01:09:41,303 --> 01:09:43,347
It's a great movie.
It has the feel of our movie.

1473
01:09:43,722 --> 01:09:46,850
You went and saw it right away
and the hire that came out of it was,

1474
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,853
Russell as the production designer.
It's wonderful.

1475
01:09:49,978 --> 01:09:51,813
Yeah, we're really lucky to get him.

1476
01:09:52,606 --> 01:09:54,066
It's a very unusual look.

1477
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:58,445
It's sort of like happy decrepit.

1478
01:09:58,779 --> 01:10:00,864
I do need to point out
that's in a real lake.

1479
01:10:01,323 --> 01:10:02,491
That's a real lake.

1480
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:04,344
You can look at that and go
that's a green screen,

1481
01:10:04,368 --> 01:10:06,661
but they we were literally at...
Still at Stone Mountain.

1482
01:10:06,787 --> 01:10:08,538
We did have to build the dock.

1483
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:13,323
- But it was made out of real wood.
- It was made out of real wood.

1484
01:10:14,669 --> 01:10:17,964
I think this was the day
where I really, you know...

1485
01:10:18,048 --> 01:10:21,468
This was the first time
I've dealt with a live action shoot.

1486
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:25,430
And occasionally moments of reality
hit you and go,

1487
01:10:25,514 --> 01:10:26,807
wow, this is really happening.

1488
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:30,394
We were here on this little island
and it started pouring rain.

1489
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:34,564
And we were huddled under this tent
sort of waiting for the rain to go away.

1490
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:36,650
And I was watching
all the rain land around us,

1491
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:41,113
looking at the dock, having people
rush over trying to dry the dock

1492
01:10:41,196 --> 01:10:45,617
between rain showers so that
we could have a consistent shot.

1493
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:51,706
And those mundane things were so exciting
because I hadn't dealt with that before.

1494
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:52,790
Right.

1495
01:10:53,375 --> 01:10:54,668
<i>My parents.</i>

1496
01:11:02,217 --> 01:11:05,095
What is Clancy up to?
This can't be good.

1497
01:11:05,429 --> 01:11:08,181
This was
an interesting little late addition

1498
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:10,183
because we always knew he was

1499
01:11:10,392 --> 01:11:13,478
doing this, but to show
what he was doing on the computer.

1500
01:11:13,562 --> 01:11:15,873
No, I remember I was worried
it was telegraphing too much.

1501
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:18,525
But I think Dean had some
great instincts for it,

1502
01:11:18,733 --> 01:11:24,197
how to just up the tension and jeopardy
and not be afraid of it.

1503
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:25,198
- Embrace it.
- Yeah.

1504
01:11:25,282 --> 01:11:26,950
Something bad is about to happen.

1505
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,328
Because when do you show
that the villain is the villain?

1506
01:11:30,412 --> 01:11:33,039
When do you really, really give it away?

1507
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:35,792
And if you didn't know it
before this next section,

1508
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:38,462
this next section
doesn't have any tension.

1509
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:42,632
'Cause you just have him going to her mind
and you don't really know whether

1510
01:11:42,716 --> 01:11:44,259
it means anything or not.

1511
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,597
<i>He's not stupid.
He's, like, the smartest person...</i>

1512
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,931
I mean, he is a green.

1513
01:11:50,849 --> 01:11:51,849
Huh?

1514
01:11:52,142 --> 01:11:53,142
<i>All right.</i>

1515
01:11:53,185 --> 01:11:54,829
Just talking at the screen.

1516
01:11:54,853 --> 01:11:57,105
<i>But first... you teach me.</i>

1517
01:11:58,356 --> 01:11:59,676
<i>What do you want me to teach you?</i>

1518
01:12:00,275 --> 01:12:01,401
<i>I wanna know how...</i>

1519
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:04,645
Remember? A lot of conversation
about collar up, collar down for Clancy.

1520
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,491
Collar up, evil.

1521
01:12:07,574 --> 01:12:09,784
- Collar down, good.
- Good.

1522
01:12:11,203 --> 01:12:14,080
What mood is he in?
What's his collar doing?

1523
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:17,250
<i>If we can figure out how you did it...</i>

1524
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:19,734
I wonder if this movie
will bring back the up collar.

1525
01:12:19,878 --> 01:12:21,004
I don't know.

1526
01:12:22,214 --> 01:12:26,927
One thing that's really neat about seeing
some of the descent into showing

1527
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,637
- what the villain is.
- Mm-hmm.

1528
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:32,057
'Cause that descent had
to be believable

1529
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,602
and we kept figuring where
we'd start that descent

1530
01:12:35,936 --> 01:12:39,481
to make that slide seem believable.

1531
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:44,027
And before when we didn't have the
reveal that he was the bad guy here,

1532
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:47,405
this area right here was just this gentle,

1533
01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:51,201
soft walk down memory lane that
seemed exactly like the other scenes.

1534
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:55,830
This was like a sweet little moment.
Instead...

1535
01:12:55,914 --> 01:12:57,391
But now it's got
a little bit of tension.

1536
01:12:57,415 --> 01:12:58,833
It's a little sinister.

1537
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,504
And I remember on the very
first day of shoot we shot Clancy,

1538
01:13:02,671 --> 01:13:05,966
Paddy in this room with Lidya
on the very first day.

1539
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:09,052
And everybody was saying
this looks really creepy.

1540
01:13:09,135 --> 01:13:10,696
- And I'm like, yes, it does.
- It was creepy.

1541
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:13,598
Yeah... Watching a little girl.

1542
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:16,434
<i>Don't worry anymore,
mommy and daddy.</i>

1543
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:18,728
<i>Nothing can take me away from you.</i>

1544
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:20,939
'Cause he is invading her space.

1545
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:24,943
Yeah, and I love what Kramer
did here with distortion and...

1546
01:13:25,318 --> 01:13:29,197
- He found this crazy Petzval lens.
- Oh, right.

1547
01:13:29,281 --> 01:13:34,911
And, uh, it was all
practical visual effect, in-camera effect.

1548
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:39,207
And what we ended up doing was
we'd have to swap out lenses

1549
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,875
like 8,000 times

1550
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:43,545
in order to get a regular shot
and Petzval shot.

1551
01:13:44,296 --> 01:13:48,633
And Björn had this, he basically mapped it
and said we'll replicate

1552
01:13:48,717 --> 01:13:50,552
the same effect in visual effects.

1553
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:53,763
So some of the shots are Petzval
and some of them are practical.

1554
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:56,850
Or VFX.

1555
01:13:57,225 --> 01:14:00,645
And you wouldn't really know which
ones they are 'cause they look identical.

1556
01:14:00,812 --> 01:14:02,623
<i>I'll just erase this part
and we can start over.</i>

1557
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:04,316
Now this was a tough scene to do.

1558
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:06,776
Trying to get the balance right.

1559
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:11,156
Yeah, and I wanted to make sure
that we treated it tastefully and that.

1560
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:13,551
Amandla was never uncomfortable
during this scene.

1561
01:14:13,575 --> 01:14:14,844
'Cause there was a lot
of conversation

1562
01:14:14,868 --> 01:14:17,621
throughout the script phase
and up to shooting about this scene.

1563
01:14:17,746 --> 01:14:20,540
'Cause it's a rape scene.
Or near rape scene.

1564
01:14:20,749 --> 01:14:22,584
It... It was pretty graphic.

1565
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:25,813
But it was such a critical part
of the book that there was no way there.

1566
01:14:25,837 --> 01:14:27,898
I know there was some conversation,
can you get rid of it?

1567
01:14:27,922 --> 01:14:31,051
And I think we tried to figure out
how to get rid of it.

1568
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:35,096
But you can't get rid of it
because it's integral to the book.

1569
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:38,016
Of course.
Which is why we kept it.

1570
01:14:38,183 --> 01:14:40,578
I think the big note that I had
when we first talked about the movie

1571
01:14:40,602 --> 01:14:42,270
was how do we deal with it.

1572
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:44,749
- And the two things, if we...,
- It's pretty intense

1573
01:14:44,773 --> 01:14:46,816
in the book too.
And in the original script.

1574
01:14:46,941 --> 01:14:49,736
Much more intense than
what we shot I think.

1575
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:52,021
But I think you found the
perfect balance cause it's...

1576
01:14:52,072 --> 01:14:55,575
It's a balance
of showing what happens

1577
01:14:56,034 --> 01:14:59,496
and having her actually confront it

1578
01:14:59,663 --> 01:15:02,499
and make the guy pay.

1579
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:07,962
<i>Through here.</i>

1580
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:12,092
<i>Come on. This way is not guarded.</i>

1581
01:15:12,342 --> 01:15:16,638
This scene was actually one
in the very original draft,

1582
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:19,391
did not have Clancy showing up here.

1583
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,685
It was more of a scene
between him and Captain.

1584
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,039
- And, uh...
- Right. I remember.

1585
01:15:25,063 --> 01:15:28,650
And this was a tough scene to get this
together in terms of production design.

1586
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:30,735
Yeah, this one I boarded myself.

1587
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:34,280
Remember? Because it was
so important to me to get right.

1588
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:40,203
Do you remember Wade was banging
his head against the wall to get the feel

1589
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:42,223
of what it would be like to
be thrown against the wall.

1590
01:15:42,247 --> 01:15:43,748
He was a real method actor.

1591
01:15:43,832 --> 01:15:45,417
He was very method about it.

1592
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:47,961
And I said, "You don't have
to do that, Wade."

1593
01:15:48,086 --> 01:15:49,606
Yeah.

1594
01:15:49,713 --> 01:15:51,005
It's not our idea.

1595
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:54,092
But he was really
throwing himself into it.

1596
01:15:55,969 --> 01:15:57,595
But I love the sort of simplicity

1597
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:00,140
of the light bar here
and then being confronted

1598
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:01,349
by all these soldiers.

1599
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:05,353
Remember, we had to figure out
why are they going inside to get away?

1600
01:16:05,562 --> 01:16:08,773
And we... I think we pulled it off,
but I remember it was a little tricky

1601
01:16:08,857 --> 01:16:11,735
to establish this set.

1602
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:14,863
This is also not what
it was like in the book.

1603
01:16:14,946 --> 01:16:15,947
This is very different

1604
01:16:16,114 --> 01:16:17,717
from the original draft of the script
and the book.

1605
01:16:17,741 --> 01:16:20,493
Because in the book, you didn't have
this confrontation here.

1606
01:16:20,577 --> 01:16:22,737
- You had it in the middle of the battle.
- No.

1607
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:24,098
- And he never...
- Oh, right.

1608
01:16:24,122 --> 01:16:25,975
- Punched Liam repeatedly.
- Yeah, I remember that.

1609
01:16:25,999 --> 01:16:30,712
This was all an addition,
and the reason why I boarded it

1610
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:34,340
was because...
Not for the setup of the compositions,

1611
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:39,471
but I wanted to get this moment where
he is confronting the other suitor.

1612
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:44,893
So that literally he's punching Liam
because he has so much more power.

1613
01:16:44,976 --> 01:16:47,061
- Like, look how much power I have.
- Right.

1614
01:16:47,145 --> 01:16:49,689
And it's a way to build Ruby

1615
01:16:49,814 --> 01:16:51,584
to the place
where she's gonna be strong enough

1616
01:16:51,608 --> 01:16:54,027
to change into this other person.

1617
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:59,240
This powerful person that's gonna sort
of become the protector of the group.

1618
01:16:59,407 --> 01:17:00,617
<i>It sucks, Ruby.</i>

1619
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:04,078
<i>We could have been leading
an army together.</i>

1620
01:17:06,039 --> 01:17:08,058
And it's so creepy the fact
that he's punching him.

1621
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:10,585
He can't fight back.
It's so underhanded.

1622
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:13,296
And again, I somehow,

1623
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:16,090
'cause of Paddy's acting,
I feel bad for him.

1624
01:17:16,174 --> 01:17:18,051
He's got such pain in his delivery.

1625
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:20,845
I remember on set thinking
he's playing it with such hurt.

1626
01:17:20,929 --> 01:17:22,615
- Yeah.
- That you feel for him.

1627
01:17:22,639 --> 01:17:25,391
In his very screwed up way.

1628
01:17:25,517 --> 01:17:27,244
And obviously,
it's impossible to root for him

1629
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:29,562
after an attempted assault on Ruby.

1630
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:31,731
- But, uh...
- If you can empathize

1631
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:33,942
with a villain and you feel bad
for him whatever

1632
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:37,654
it is that's tortured him in this place.
Then that's a good performance.

1633
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:41,115
I also didn't want
to have cartoon violence.

1634
01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:45,954
I mean, a guy's getting kicked
and I wanted to make sure it looked real.

1635
01:17:47,247 --> 01:17:50,166
And that he's gonna be dealing with it
for the rest of the movie.

1636
01:17:54,796 --> 01:17:56,631
I love that little Zu is so dangerous.

1637
01:17:57,423 --> 01:18:00,301
Yeah,
it was a constant refrain of mine

1638
01:18:00,385 --> 01:18:01,985
which I'm sure you were tired of hearing

1639
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:03,322
was more light, more lighting,
more danger.

1640
01:18:03,346 --> 01:18:05,146
- More lightening.
- More power.

1641
01:18:05,515 --> 01:18:07,100
And our Ospreys.

1642
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:09,394
This was about two weeks
of night shoots.

1643
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:10,645
In the rain.

1644
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:13,481
In a muddy bog of a rain
which you hopefully can't tell some days.

1645
01:18:13,565 --> 01:18:14,816
Right next to a bog.

1646
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:17,777
So it literally was a bog
and had mosquitos all over the place.

1647
01:18:18,403 --> 01:18:19,404
Um, and I think...

1648
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,882
And if we haven't
mentioned before, Jen does not like bugs.

1649
01:18:21,906 --> 01:18:23,700
I don't like bugs.

1650
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:28,371
But this was all night time so we went to
straight night shoots for two weeks.

1651
01:18:28,496 --> 01:18:30,096
- It was brutal.
- It was brutal.

1652
01:18:30,665 --> 01:18:32,166
I think we lost a couple days

1653
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:34,669
because of the rain
or we had to wrap early.

1654
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:37,881
And this was great.
I remember watching the rehearsal on this

1655
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:40,425
with the revealing of the reds and...

1656
01:18:41,134 --> 01:18:45,930
I love that the red is the sweetest,
most beautiful little girl.

1657
01:18:46,514 --> 01:18:50,268
And it's worth noting
that all the reds with the hoods off

1658
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:55,189
are the kids of stunt men.

1659
01:18:55,273 --> 01:18:56,816
- And they're stunt kids.
- Yeah.

1660
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,460
We had to make sure
that everybody was safe.

1661
01:18:58,484 --> 01:19:00,504
They can actually do...
Uh, there goes Mike.

1662
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:03,823
There was practical flames
in addition to non-practical flames.

1663
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:06,628
And we wanted to make sure
everybody was very safe through all this.

1664
01:19:07,118 --> 01:19:08,518
Yeah, we definitely were...

1665
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:10,830
I think the idea was to go with
practical flames,

1666
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:15,335
um, but when we saw a cut of the film,
we needed to enhance some

1667
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:21,799
because it just didn't have that
otherworldly supernatural power to it.

1668
01:19:21,966 --> 01:19:22,966
Yeah.

1669
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:25,112
- Extra terrifying there.
- But, yeah, safety first.

1670
01:19:25,136 --> 01:19:26,220
Safety first.

1671
01:19:27,305 --> 01:19:31,684
Kramer was, uh, trying to get
a lot of the visual effects,

1672
01:19:31,768 --> 01:19:34,979
the practical effects of the flames.

1673
01:19:35,063 --> 01:19:37,065
Any DP is gonna want that.

1674
01:19:37,148 --> 01:19:38,148
Yeah.

1675
01:19:38,358 --> 01:19:42,070
I re... And you, Jen, I remember
the idea that it had that little bit of

1676
01:19:42,153 --> 01:19:46,115
a concussive air ripple with
the heat blast was

1677
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:48,034
a real, smart little tweak.

1678
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:49,837
I don't know if people
will notice it but...

1679
01:19:50,370 --> 01:19:54,290
'Cause it's not...
It's not unrealistic. It's real flames.

1680
01:19:54,374 --> 01:19:58,962
But with a tweak which is kind
of the tone of the whole movie.

1681
01:20:00,213 --> 01:20:02,548
Remember way back when,

1682
01:20:02,757 --> 01:20:05,259
way, way in the very beginning
when basically there's me

1683
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:08,221
and my husband and Molly sitting,

1684
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,324
trying to figure out
what to do with the movie

1685
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:12,576
- in a little tiny office.
- In Hollywood, right?

1686
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,144
Yeah. This scene,
we were boarding on the wall.

1687
01:20:15,228 --> 01:20:18,856
And I showed you the scene where
everybody's kneeling in front of Clancy.

1688
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:24,404
That was a very early little visual play.

1689
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:27,323
Yeah, I remember on set that day,
it was a conversation.

1690
01:20:27,407 --> 01:20:30,535
How many kids
or do we have too many kids doing it?

1691
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:32,738
Or not enough kids?
But I think you got it just right.

1692
01:20:33,538 --> 01:20:36,249
I just love the fact he has
that much power over these kids.

1693
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:39,043
It's a quick visual read
of they're in trouble.

1694
01:20:39,127 --> 01:20:40,420
This is a great beat.

1695
01:20:41,629 --> 01:20:43,131
It shows her powerful.

1696
01:20:43,548 --> 01:20:47,260
Shows her facing this guy,
which I love.

1697
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:48,511
And glowing eyes!

1698
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,225
This was in the original pitch

1699
01:20:54,726 --> 01:20:56,519
- to marketing.
- Right.

1700
01:20:56,602 --> 01:21:01,065
I remember the look between them.

1701
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:04,986
Even in your storyboards, Jen.

1702
01:21:05,236 --> 01:21:07,613
Just the back and forth, this was great.

1703
01:21:08,406 --> 01:21:11,034
Because again, it shows strength.

1704
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:14,954
It shows power to have
these big burly guys just taken over.

1705
01:21:15,038 --> 01:21:18,166
They're almost the chess pieces
in this game between them.

1706
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,417
Yeah.

1707
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:23,087
One thing I'm happy about
'cause in other films is sometimes you

1708
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:25,757
cast the extras for soldiers

1709
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:27,967
and they come to set
and they're very small,

1710
01:21:28,301 --> 01:21:31,554
thin, and don't have
that physical presence.

1711
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:35,558
And I remember us saying
to the extras casting,

1712
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:36,768
get us football players.

1713
01:21:36,851 --> 01:21:38,853
Former military people
who look intimidating.

1714
01:21:39,020 --> 01:21:40,396
Yeah.

1715
01:21:41,689 --> 01:21:44,369
I just wanted to make sure they knew
how to handle themselves.

1716
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,253
Right and that's another thing
you sometimes find.

1717
01:21:46,277 --> 01:21:48,863
Is that they actually don't know how
to handle a gun.

1718
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:50,066
And so it doesn't look real.

1719
01:21:50,114 --> 01:21:52,617
And I always catch that
in movies or TV shows.

1720
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:53,868
In the background.

1721
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:57,205
But we had them perfectly trained.

1722
01:21:57,914 --> 01:22:03,711
I love this beat because
it just shows what she's capable of doing.

1723
01:22:04,003 --> 01:22:07,173
The moment where she finally
grows into herself completely.

1724
01:22:07,298 --> 01:22:10,426
And realizes she's powerful
and she can fight back.

1725
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:13,304
I love that shot of her
with her eyes looking up at the Osprey.

1726
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:14,388
<i>I kinda like how I am.</i>

1727
01:22:14,472 --> 01:22:15,598
That's a great line.

1728
01:22:16,516 --> 01:22:20,436
And I think it's empowering
for women to hear that,

1729
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,960
to have a character say,
I'm not gonna... You can't change me.

1730
01:22:24,816 --> 01:22:28,027
I think everybody goes
through relationships like that.

1731
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:29,880
And I think we should point out
that's a real Osprey

1732
01:22:29,904 --> 01:22:31,572
we crashed multiple times.

1733
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:33,576
Multiple times.
We had to have five spares.

1734
01:22:33,658 --> 01:22:35,761
The Osprey budget of this movie
was just incredible.

1735
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:37,554
It was amazing.
It just missed her head.

1736
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:40,039
We totally lucked out on that one.

1737
01:22:40,206 --> 01:22:44,293
Um. No, that was
pretty brilliant CG work on the Ospreys.

1738
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,088
And it's tough when
you're watching cuts in the early days.

1739
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:49,882
- It's so skeletal and not done...
- You have no idea

1740
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:52,194
- what you're getting.
- And you just hope that one day

1741
01:22:52,218 --> 01:22:55,179
uh, it'll look great.
And Björn did an amazing job.

1742
01:22:55,263 --> 01:22:58,015
This beat right here
really came out nicely too of Clancy.

1743
01:22:58,266 --> 01:23:02,061
Clancy, I mean of Chubs saving her
and getting burnt in the process.

1744
01:23:02,228 --> 01:23:03,563
Chubs is the hero.

1745
01:23:03,896 --> 01:23:06,023
The understated hero of them all.

1746
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:12,947
You know, this shows
how committed the actors were.

1747
01:23:13,239 --> 01:23:16,242
On the day they showed up and
their clothes weren't quite dirty enough.

1748
01:23:16,367 --> 01:23:19,996
And both of them just jumped down,
rolled around in the dirt for a while

1749
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:23,124
to get themselves properly
messed up for this shot.

1750
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:26,811
There's your smiley face again.

1751
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:27,919
Yeah,

1752
01:23:28,379 --> 01:23:30,756
subliminal little smiley faces everywhere.

1753
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:40,183
This is, um...
This is a nice moment for Chubs.

1754
01:23:40,266 --> 01:23:43,603
We're really debating
just how damaged his face was.

1755
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:47,690
Yes, we had to worry about...
Obviously, he had to look gravely injured,

1756
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:52,403
but we also had to worry about rating
and um, gross out factor.

1757
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:56,115
The great thing about the make up
in this movie and Donald...

1758
01:23:56,199 --> 01:23:58,701
Donald's amazing.
I have not mentioned that yet.

1759
01:23:58,784 --> 01:24:00,411
Donald Mowat is the best.

1760
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:03,456
One of the best, most legendary
make-up guys in the business

1761
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:06,792
and the reason why he's so great is
you don't notice what he does.

1762
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:08,937
He's such a pro. He's one of...

1763
01:24:08,961 --> 01:24:12,590
He's so naturalistic in how he makes
people look without making them look like

1764
01:24:12,673 --> 01:24:13,925
they're wearing anything.

1765
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:18,387
And he did all of this work
on the burns and everything,

1766
01:24:18,471 --> 01:24:20,681
it looks very subtle. Tasteful.

1767
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:26,270
Remember there were a lot

1768
01:24:26,395 --> 01:24:28,081
of last minute conversations
about that button.

1769
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:31,025
I remember the early version
was not ideal.

1770
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:34,004
- We had to...
- But we got it right.

1771
01:24:34,028 --> 01:24:36,148
We had to shimmy around
that button quite a bit.

1772
01:24:39,325 --> 01:24:40,325
<i>Chubs?</i>

1773
01:24:45,665 --> 01:24:48,505
Even in the daytime you see
the burns and they still look natural.

1774
01:24:48,668 --> 01:24:50,753
- Mm-hmm.
- Not horror movie.

1775
01:24:54,257 --> 01:24:55,549
<i>I knew you were okay.</i>

1776
01:24:56,050 --> 01:24:59,762
I think this was the day where
just watching this performance,

1777
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:01,889
it was a very simple scene,
the two of them.

1778
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:06,936
In fact, the ending of the movie was
the first thing that we knew that we had

1779
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,982
in that, unless you have a good ending
you don't have a movie

1780
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:14,151
and I hate the idea
of people barreling into production

1781
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:15,778
when they don't have the ending.

1782
01:25:15,861 --> 01:25:17,947
I mean, how do you know
what anything's going to?

1783
01:25:18,531 --> 01:25:22,910
And this is sort of the flight into
the big emotional...

1784
01:25:23,828 --> 01:25:25,621
sort of finale of the relationship.

1785
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:29,917
And this day, I remember
we were watching the two of them.

1786
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:31,377
Such a simple scene.

1787
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:35,256
But there's so much going on between them
just emotionally, facially.

1788
01:25:35,339 --> 01:25:38,634
I remember I missed it because
when we were doing the crew call,

1789
01:25:38,718 --> 01:25:40,878
it's when I found out my daughter
was going to be born.

1790
01:25:40,928 --> 01:25:42,781
That's right, you had
to rush off set that day.

1791
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:46,017
I did and so I missed
the actual shooting of this moment.

1792
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:49,687
But, yeah,
I remember it was a splits that day.

1793
01:25:50,104 --> 01:25:53,065
And I got to set and I was like,
oh, I got to leave.

1794
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:55,669
- I think you had a good excuse.
- Yeah.

1795
01:25:55,693 --> 01:25:57,129
- It was a pretty good excuse.
- Yeah.

1796
01:25:57,153 --> 01:26:00,364
You can't pull that one too often, though.

1797
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:03,576
<i>I'm not leaving you.</i>

1798
01:26:03,993 --> 01:26:07,079
But again, the performances
of these guys are just so amazing.

1799
01:26:07,163 --> 01:26:08,706
These actors are so good.

1800
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:10,166
Yeah, we really...

1801
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:15,171
Sometimes you don't always get it right,
but I feel like the cast we got

1802
01:26:15,254 --> 01:26:17,048
for this movie we got it really right,

1803
01:26:17,131 --> 01:26:19,425
and they're really the next generation
of great actors.

1804
01:26:19,592 --> 01:26:23,387
There was a lot of effort put into
finding the right group.

1805
01:26:23,471 --> 01:26:24,781
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

1806
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:28,434
The chemistry of this group
was a big thing for us in the beginning.

1807
01:26:29,602 --> 01:26:32,480
- And they're really good kids too.
- Yeah.

1808
01:26:32,563 --> 01:26:35,334
If you're going to be spending
this much time with people in the woods,

1809
01:26:35,358 --> 01:26:36,525
you better like them.

1810
01:26:36,609 --> 01:26:39,129
- You don't always get that luxury.
- That's rule one in filmmaking.

1811
01:26:39,153 --> 01:26:40,154
Yeah.

1812
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:44,867
I was always curious, Jen,
why'd you go with the one-armed aiming?

1813
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:47,286
Because it's awesome.

1814
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:50,051
I like this shot a lot
of just the feet and the foreground.

1815
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:52,100
- It was a beautiful action.
- It's actually because

1816
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:53,000
it's a trunk shot.

1817
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:55,228
Those are actually my feet, Dan.
I don't know if you know that.

1818
01:26:55,252 --> 01:26:56,587
I was back from the hospital.

1819
01:26:57,213 --> 01:27:00,800
Dan's a multi-hyphenate producer
and leg model.

1820
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:09,100
So, the safe house.

1821
01:27:10,559 --> 01:27:12,603
Yeah, we could have gone
with a full-on crazy,

1822
01:27:12,686 --> 01:27:15,022
you know, James Bond lair kind of thing.

1823
01:27:15,106 --> 01:27:16,625
No, I think
the grounded approach is...

1824
01:27:16,649 --> 01:27:18,901
- Full grounded.
- So much better.

1825
01:27:19,026 --> 01:27:20,653
<i>Chubs, he's in the hospital.</i>

1826
01:27:21,070 --> 01:27:23,197
<i>He's in pretty bad shape.
So if he has any chance...</i>

1827
01:27:23,697 --> 01:27:27,493
Someone's real house with cute dogs
that they had to put away for the day.

1828
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:29,897
It was a very nice house.

1829
01:27:30,037 --> 01:27:31,037
A very nice house.

1830
01:27:32,164 --> 01:27:34,083
And it was air conditioned
which was helpful.

1831
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:36,836
That's a plus in Atlanta.

1832
01:27:38,254 --> 01:27:42,967
Again, this was a scene
that was a bit different.

1833
01:27:43,217 --> 01:27:47,012
And it sort of leads to one
of my favorite movies...

1834
01:27:47,221 --> 01:27:51,684
moments of this movie
is how she gets rid of Rob.

1835
01:27:51,809 --> 01:27:53,954
Oh, yeah. That always got
a good laugh which was nice.

1836
01:27:53,978 --> 01:27:55,813
I love a movie when you...

1837
01:27:56,689 --> 01:28:00,276
that's as intense as this one
when you can earn those laughs

1838
01:28:00,526 --> 01:28:02,862
and that was a nice beat
that's about to come up.

1839
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:04,798
And that wasn't in
the original draft and uh...

1840
01:28:04,822 --> 01:28:05,822
No.

1841
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:09,285
It just seemed like, especially
with so much intensity happening,

1842
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:13,998
you need that moment of lightness before
we go into this next big emotional beat.

1843
01:28:14,123 --> 01:28:15,123
Yeah.

1844
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,086
And again, it gives you satisfaction
to see her do this.

1845
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:21,672
- It's so good.
- Well, yeah, it turned into a...

1846
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:26,594
fantasy for a teen to be able
to make an adult shut up.

1847
01:28:27,845 --> 01:28:30,514
Everybody wants
to have the power to do that, right?

1848
01:28:30,598 --> 01:28:31,640
<i>You're an asshole.</i>

1849
01:28:31,974 --> 01:28:33,142
<i>I'm an asshole.</i>

1850
01:28:33,476 --> 01:28:35,519
I love that.

1851
01:28:36,854 --> 01:28:38,790
I love the look
that Mandy gives her here.

1852
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:41,442
- Yeah.
- Don't do that to me, please.

1853
01:28:41,525 --> 01:28:43,986
And Rob committed to it, you know?

1854
01:28:44,737 --> 01:28:48,324
Mark was just in it for that moment.

1855
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:50,052
- He's a trooper.
- Yeah.

1856
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:53,594
Please don't call me an asshole.

1857
01:28:56,957 --> 01:29:00,753
At this point, she's so powerful,
she's able to do so much,

1858
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:03,214
but she's still dealing with,

1859
01:29:03,422 --> 01:29:06,592
she's living in a system
that's still bigger than her,

1860
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:09,512
which is difficult.

1861
01:29:09,595 --> 01:29:11,055
I love the fact she gets smarter,

1862
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:14,475
I love the fact that she actually starts
taking control of the situation...

1863
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:16,286
That's a big theme, control.

1864
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:21,440
Yeah, control and being comfortable
with what she's capable of

1865
01:29:22,191 --> 01:29:23,400
for the right reasons.

1866
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:28,405
I remember this moment here
where he steps back...

1867
01:29:28,489 --> 01:29:29,549
Yeah, it got a big laugh

1868
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:31,092
- in the previews...
- It got a big laugh on set.

1869
01:29:31,116 --> 01:29:32,116
Yeah.

1870
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:34,471
It's subtle. It's the little things,
it's the little things.

1871
01:29:34,495 --> 01:29:37,873
And, Jen, this was always a scene,
really this movie got greenlit

1872
01:29:37,957 --> 01:29:41,794
because you did an animatic of this moment
and it moved people so much

1873
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:46,298
and it's one of the moments in the movie
that didn't change much. That it...

1874
01:29:46,382 --> 01:29:48,527
We always had an ending, it's where
usually you have to figure out

1875
01:29:48,551 --> 01:29:50,803
your ending, we shoot your ending,
this always works.

1876
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:52,072
Want to talk about that a bit?

1877
01:29:52,096 --> 01:29:57,393
Yeah, it was the thing that really
made me sign onto the movie was this beat,

1878
01:29:57,476 --> 01:30:00,187
because if you don't have
an emotional core to the movie,

1879
01:30:00,271 --> 01:30:03,691
you don't have a movie
and this always was in the book.

1880
01:30:03,774 --> 01:30:07,278
This moment where she erases him
was so heart wrenching

1881
01:30:07,695 --> 01:30:09,822
and, uh, I actually went back

1882
01:30:09,905 --> 01:30:13,492
to the book to try and get the story
to be closer to what the book was.

1883
01:30:13,617 --> 01:30:14,617
Mm-hmm.

1884
01:30:14,702 --> 01:30:19,123
The words that he says,
the story that he gives is just so...

1885
01:30:19,415 --> 01:30:21,500
it's heartbreaking
what he's talking about,

1886
01:30:21,584 --> 01:30:22,710
their future lives together.

1887
01:30:22,793 --> 01:30:24,503
You wrote this.

1888
01:30:24,587 --> 01:30:27,214
Well, I went back to the book
and sort of basically found...

1889
01:30:27,298 --> 01:30:29,818
- Help piece it together.
- Help piece it together.

1890
01:30:29,842 --> 01:30:33,596
But I did craft it very carefully.

1891
01:30:34,722 --> 01:30:36,932
Because this had to be
the moment where you cry.

1892
01:30:37,016 --> 01:30:40,603
This is the grown, hairy man crying,
bawling into his popcorn kind of thing...

1893
01:30:40,686 --> 01:30:42,967
I would hear Dan through
our office wall, sobbing.

1894
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:45,682
Multiple times, but each time.

1895
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:48,694
But getting this moment

1896
01:30:48,777 --> 01:30:51,530
and people felt it on that day
when we were shooting it,

1897
01:30:51,905 --> 01:30:54,074
the camera people watching them film it...

1898
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:57,328
I think it was your
simple animatic to shooting it,

1899
01:30:57,411 --> 01:31:00,080
to watching it in previews,
it always worked.

1900
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:03,292
And even a simple animatic,
I set it to music,

1901
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:06,253
and I showed it, that this is
what the movie could be like,

1902
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,757
- and you could feel that even then.
- Mm-hmm.

1903
01:31:09,882 --> 01:31:11,383
And what was really amazing

1904
01:31:11,508 --> 01:31:15,179
was watching our actors
performing this beat

1905
01:31:15,262 --> 01:31:19,558
in real life, it was a chilly moment.
Chillies.

1906
01:31:19,642 --> 01:31:21,602
<i>Running off to some fancy university.</i>

1907
01:31:22,853 --> 01:31:25,564
<i>My mom can't bear to see her baby leave.
So...</i>

1908
01:31:26,649 --> 01:31:28,359
And those are real tears.

1909
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:30,653
Oh, yes, they are.

1910
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,115
We actually had to clean up a few.

1911
01:31:35,908 --> 01:31:42,039
Yeah, Amandla had
an amazing ability to tear on command...

1912
01:31:42,122 --> 01:31:43,624
when she needed to.

1913
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:45,417
One of them is not real,

1914
01:31:45,626 --> 01:31:48,545
but I dare anyone to try
and figure out which one.

1915
01:31:48,629 --> 01:31:51,298
The blue one.

1916
01:31:54,885 --> 01:31:58,597
Again, so much of the work
in this movie was done for stuff

1917
01:31:58,681 --> 01:32:00,099
that you don't notice.

1918
01:32:00,933 --> 01:32:04,478
A sort of enhanced reality
rather than anything too overt.

1919
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:07,606
<i>Earbuds in, music blaring.</i>

1920
01:32:11,819 --> 01:32:14,405
- It's such an emotional beat.
- It's great.

1921
01:32:15,906 --> 01:32:18,617
The reason Dan's not talking right now
is he's actually crying.

1922
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:23,205
Pass the tissues. There, there.

1923
01:32:24,289 --> 01:32:28,293
Just plug in me. I'm back on after
an emotional couple of moments.

1924
01:32:33,674 --> 01:32:35,092
This score is beautiful.

1925
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:36,968
Yeah.

1926
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:39,096
<i>What happens next?</i>

1927
01:32:42,349 --> 01:32:45,310
Again, the performances are so good.

1928
01:32:45,561 --> 01:32:46,603
This line.

1929
01:32:47,062 --> 01:32:48,480
<i>I tell you that I love you.</i>

1930
01:32:48,564 --> 01:32:50,964
- That's a pretty good one.
- That right there.

1931
01:33:01,535 --> 01:33:02,786
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

1932
01:33:03,537 --> 01:33:04,621
So beautiful.

1933
01:33:06,290 --> 01:33:08,208
<i>I'm gonna finish the story.</i>

1934
01:33:17,593 --> 01:33:20,763
We had a lot of debate on whether
her eyes should go on or off.

1935
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:23,974
Yeah, we did.

1936
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:28,562
I wasn't so sure we should,
but I think in the end it works.

1937
01:33:28,812 --> 01:33:32,900
I really liked having it on,
because it's a subtle little thing

1938
01:33:32,983 --> 01:33:35,652
and we played with the sound to make sure
that it's not too much.

1939
01:33:35,736 --> 01:33:36,737
And this, again,

1940
01:33:36,862 --> 01:33:40,282
back to our smoke erasing effect
which is so eloquent.

1941
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:42,743
And, again,
this was all from the beginning,

1942
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:44,995
what we were planning
the whole movie around.

1943
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:49,500
So whenever we shot all these locations,
we would have the erasure shot

1944
01:33:49,583 --> 01:33:52,920
that we would pick up on the day
knowing that we were going to be using it

1945
01:33:53,003 --> 01:33:54,647
- for this section.
- I love that image.

1946
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:57,216
In fact,
they're using it internationally a lot.

1947
01:33:58,050 --> 01:33:59,090
As a poster, yeah.

1948
01:33:59,426 --> 01:34:01,146
- Yeah.
- It's heart breaking.

1949
01:34:05,349 --> 01:34:08,310
In fact, it's one of the reasons
why we wanted to make the movie

1950
01:34:08,393 --> 01:34:13,023
as pretty as it is, because if the movie
had ugly images you were erasing,

1951
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:14,483
you would go, oh, that's fine.

1952
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:17,212
- He doesn't want to remember.
- You got a situation there.

1953
01:34:17,236 --> 01:34:20,781
It had to be the most beautiful images
that you can't imagine losing.

1954
01:34:20,864 --> 01:34:21,944
That's the great...

1955
01:34:22,074 --> 01:34:25,577
The most moving thing
is that she has to erase herself

1956
01:34:25,661 --> 01:34:27,830
and his love of her from him.

1957
01:34:28,163 --> 01:34:30,040
She's sacrificing that to save him.

1958
01:34:30,123 --> 01:34:31,123
Yeah.

1959
01:34:40,634 --> 01:34:41,634
<i>Who are you?</i>

1960
01:34:41,718 --> 01:34:43,613
I really love the fact
that we don't linger

1961
01:34:43,637 --> 01:34:45,907
and don't have a whole bunch of,
wait, what just happened?

1962
01:34:45,931 --> 01:34:49,035
No. I remember in an earlier cut
there was a little more space in there.

1963
01:34:49,059 --> 01:34:50,203
We actually filmed all of that.

1964
01:34:50,227 --> 01:34:54,273
- Yeah, smartly tightened it up.
- I love that it's gone.

1965
01:34:55,357 --> 01:34:56,859
<i>I don't want anything from you.</i>

1966
01:35:00,779 --> 01:35:05,617
And this is another reason why
when we were first formulating the movie,

1967
01:35:05,701 --> 01:35:07,911
why that Gudetama was so important.

1968
01:35:08,495 --> 01:35:12,457
Without it, it's very hard to know
whether she's leaving hope.

1969
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:15,294
- Mm-hmm.
- This just becomes a sad ending.

1970
01:35:15,961 --> 01:35:19,798
Whereas if you have a visual cue,
like she's leaving him a bread crumb,

1971
01:35:19,923 --> 01:35:23,176
just a little something to give you hope
like maybe he'll remember...

1972
01:35:23,260 --> 01:35:24,487
They're not totally disconnected.

1973
01:35:24,511 --> 01:35:28,724
Right. She's getting him to safety
but she's giving a little bit of hope,

1974
01:35:28,807 --> 01:35:30,934
someday maybe this will work out.

1975
01:35:31,101 --> 01:35:32,662
Again,
do you want to talk about the song?

1976
01:35:32,686 --> 01:35:34,730
'Cause this was also,
we knew from minute one,

1977
01:35:34,813 --> 01:35:35,898
the perfect song.

1978
01:35:36,064 --> 01:35:37,733
It was one of those...

1979
01:35:38,525 --> 01:35:40,986
We actually filmed it
with this song in mind.

1980
01:35:41,862 --> 01:35:46,283
And it was one of the first round of, hey,
wouldn't these wish-list songs be good.

1981
01:35:46,992 --> 01:35:51,955
And Anton actually, he sent this list
and I listened to it and instantly

1982
01:35:52,164 --> 01:35:55,751
I saw the end of the movie,
I saw every shot at the end of this movie.

1983
01:35:55,834 --> 01:35:57,753
Exactly what it needed to be.

1984
01:35:58,295 --> 01:36:03,550
And so I edited the song down to exactly
what I needed and made an animatic,

1985
01:36:03,634 --> 01:36:06,219
that was not like a drawing animatic
but a word animatic,

1986
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:09,306
with shots of Ruby walking,
Gudetama shot,

1987
01:36:09,389 --> 01:36:11,183
Liam turns, starts to walk down that...

1988
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:14,353
I remember you showing that
and I was amazed how just a simple text...

1989
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:18,440
Each one of these shots is exactly
what was set to music

1990
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:22,069
and we filmed it on the day
with the music in mind for this.

1991
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:25,739
Her turning, the way her feet are walking,

1992
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:30,285
how that goes into her
going into the stadium,

1993
01:36:30,369 --> 01:36:32,704
all the shots with the kids
with their hands raised.

1994
01:36:33,163 --> 01:36:37,626
All of that was set to the music
and we filmed every single shot

1995
01:36:37,709 --> 01:36:39,169
to the timing that we needed.

1996
01:36:40,796 --> 01:36:41,797
Smart.

1997
01:36:42,089 --> 01:36:46,176
But the weird thing is,
even an animatic with words,

1998
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:51,390
just words on a screen and this song
made people stop and go,

1999
01:36:51,473 --> 01:36:53,850
that feels like something.

2000
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:56,871
By the way, we have a cameo
of our author, right there.

2001
01:36:56,895 --> 01:36:58,247
- Alexandra Bracken, nurse.
- Nurse.

2002
01:36:58,271 --> 01:36:59,991
- Alexandra!
- Made the movie.

2003
01:37:01,149 --> 01:37:02,275
She was very worried.

2004
01:37:02,818 --> 01:37:04,796
- She did very well, she...
- She did amazing.

2005
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:07,020
Yeah, I remember
she was worried about tripping.

2006
01:37:07,239 --> 01:37:09,079
There were a lot of cables
on the ground.

2007
01:37:09,366 --> 01:37:10,534
I love this shot.

2008
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:14,496
Yeah, remember we had
to make him a little bit more damaged,

2009
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:17,290
early versions he didn't look like
a plane landed on him.

2010
01:37:17,374 --> 01:37:18,374
Right.

2011
01:37:19,376 --> 01:37:22,838
This is an actual abandoned stadium,
which is kind of crazy.

2012
01:37:22,921 --> 01:37:25,024
It is amazing how many
abandoned structures we found

2013
01:37:25,048 --> 01:37:26,442
that worked for the movie in Atlanta.

2014
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:28,111
Yeah.
It's an actual abandoned stadium.

2015
01:37:28,135 --> 01:37:31,346
We didn't have to do much except
for making sure the graffiti was cleared

2016
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:34,433
and make our own to cover some of it.
But, it was real.

2017
01:37:34,558 --> 01:37:37,453
And then remember spending time
trying to figure out what color orange,

2018
01:37:37,477 --> 01:37:40,238
- what shade of orange paint?
- We really worked hard on that.

2019
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:42,399
And I think we nailed it.

2020
01:37:49,906 --> 01:37:52,034
Dan, why didn't you
and I get a cameo in the stands?

2021
01:37:52,117 --> 01:37:53,636
- I'm just realizing,
- Yeah, why didn't you?

2022
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:55,162
What happened there?

2023
01:37:55,245 --> 01:37:57,565
They'd be like, what are
those two old guys doing in there?

2024
01:37:58,707 --> 01:38:00,226
That doesn't seem appropriate.

2025
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:02,812
- And that is <i>The Darkest Minds.</i>
- That is <i>The Darkest Minds.</i>

2026
01:38:02,836 --> 01:38:06,214
Here's our awesome credit sequence.

2027
01:38:06,673 --> 01:38:09,176
Which also took probably
very few people think about,

2028
01:38:09,259 --> 01:38:11,970
the amount of effort
that goes into getting this right...

2029
01:38:12,888 --> 01:38:15,432
But, yeah, we put a lot of thought into
trying to find a simple

2030
01:38:15,515 --> 01:38:20,228
but elegant font and effect.

2031
01:38:20,562 --> 01:38:23,899
With cool, you know,
back shots, moments from the movie,

2032
01:38:23,982 --> 01:38:25,400
like the train tracks there.

2033
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:33,241
I always liked the idea of having
something beautiful to look at

2034
01:38:33,325 --> 01:38:36,620
so that people sit through
and watch the hardworking people.

2035
01:38:36,703 --> 01:38:39,623
The only thing we're missing
is a post-credit.

2036
01:38:39,873 --> 01:38:41,374
Uh... Sto...

2037
01:38:41,541 --> 01:38:43,541
Yeah, what happened
to the post-credit scene?

2038
01:38:43,585 --> 01:38:46,046
Post credit scene
following a Twinkie.

2039
01:38:47,506 --> 01:38:50,258
That's right. What was in the Twinkie?

2040
01:38:50,342 --> 01:38:52,820
Is it too late to do this?
It would have been awesome if we...

2041
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:55,764
You're the producer, get the money
for it, let's do it now.

2042
01:38:55,847 --> 01:38:57,057
Little Easter egg.

2043
01:38:58,225 --> 01:39:00,393
We should introduce the character
from the second book.

2044
01:39:00,727 --> 01:39:01,978
Oh, my gosh.

2045
01:39:03,438 --> 01:39:06,817
I just like the idea of ending
the movie with an uplift

2046
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:09,611
and it's sort of empowering.

2047
01:39:09,903 --> 01:39:14,199
I remember
when we first heard Ben, our composer,

2048
01:39:14,282 --> 01:39:17,869
who's amazing, his approach
to this end score

2049
01:39:17,994 --> 01:39:19,246
and it sounded amazing.

2050
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:22,040
Right. Because we could have gone
with a song,

2051
01:39:22,124 --> 01:39:24,459
but we never really could top
the emotion of this.

2052
01:39:24,543 --> 01:39:26,545
Yeah, no, this felt very sweeping.

2053
01:39:27,212 --> 01:39:28,296
Powerful.

2054
01:39:30,966 --> 01:39:34,928
And also the imagery is classy.
It's really... pretty.

2055
01:39:35,053 --> 01:39:37,824
It really... Yeah, we saw a lot
of prototypes that weren't quite right

2056
01:39:37,848 --> 01:39:40,851
and I think we ended
with the best version.

2057
01:39:40,934 --> 01:39:42,060
And the Ospreys.

2058
01:39:42,352 --> 01:39:43,687
Ospreys get their moment.

2059
01:39:44,771 --> 01:39:47,732
Very cool. Well, this was fun.

2060
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:50,277
Yeah. Thanks for hearing us out.

2061
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:52,988
Yeah,
I hope if you're watching this,

2062
01:39:53,071 --> 01:39:55,115
I hope you enjoyed the movie and, uh...

2063
01:39:55,282 --> 01:39:58,160
thanks for letting us blab over it
for a while.

2064
01:39:59,744 --> 01:40:01,264
- All right.
- All right.
