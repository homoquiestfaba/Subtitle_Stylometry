1
00:00:01,824 --> 00:00:04,657
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:15,975
(bells chime)

3
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:18,475
(peppy music)

4
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:38,482
(woman speaks indistinctly to children)

5
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:45,796
- [Margret] Oh, you like this?

6
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:48,434
- Come on, come on, let's go.

7
00:01:48,434 --> 00:01:49,770
- [Margret] I think he wants my--

8
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:51,770
Hey, what are you doing?

9
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:55,225
John.

10
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:58,623
- Boy, you sure can kiss.

11
00:01:58,623 --> 00:01:59,763
- [Short Haired Woman] Maya!

12
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,623
- Are you married?

13
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,080
- Oh, God.

14
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,913
- No.

15
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,277
Why don't we ask her.

16
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:11,053
It's as good as place as any
and I want to make it official.

17
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:13,923
Margret Becker, will you marry me?

18
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:19,374
- Oh.

19
00:02:19,374 --> 00:02:20,207
Oh, John.

20
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:22,369
You know you're the best thing

21
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:24,265
that's ever come into my life,

22
00:02:24,265 --> 00:02:26,115
but have you given this some thought?

23
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:29,370
I love you, but, but, but,

24
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:32,433
what would people say?

25
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:34,250
- I don't care what people say.

26
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,180
And yes, I have thought about it a lot.

27
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,070
I want you to marry me.

28
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,903
Will you?

29
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:43,942
- Yes!

30
00:02:43,942 --> 00:02:44,892
Yes!

31
00:02:44,892 --> 00:02:46,007
I will, I will.

32
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:48,254
(children applaud and cheer)

33
00:02:48,254 --> 00:02:50,390
- Hey, hey kids, let's give
these guys a cheer, okay?

34
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:51,223
- [Children] Okay.

35
00:02:51,223 --> 00:02:52,460
- Ready, and--

36
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,839
- [Together] We are the
Indian from Camp Winnanoa

37
00:02:54,839 --> 00:02:58,589
(children continue chanting)

38
00:03:00,061 --> 00:03:02,496
We all give a cheer for you!

39
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:04,888
Winnanoa, Winnanoa, Winnanoa, whoo!

40
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:07,765
Winnanoa, Winnanoa, Winnanoa, whoo!

41
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:10,527
(children applaud and cheer)

42
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:11,360
- Thank you!

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,304
- [Short Haired Woman] Congratulations!

44
00:03:12,304 --> 00:03:13,137
- Yes, thank you!

45
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:13,970
- [Short Haired Woman] That's wonderful!

46
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,216
- Thank you.

47
00:03:15,216 --> 00:03:16,443
- [Short Haired Woman]
Come on kids, let's go.

48
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:17,819
- [Margret] Thank you, kids.

49
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,821
(John sighs)

50
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:22,738
Glad my kids are grown.

51
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,843
- Do you think they'll
come to the wedding?

52
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:28,089
- I don't know.

53
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,465
Gosh, I wonder what they're
gonna think about all this.

54
00:03:31,465 --> 00:03:32,766
- I'll charm their socks off.

55
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:34,603
- I'm not worried about you.

56
00:03:34,603 --> 00:03:36,620
- Well, they're adults, we're adults.

57
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,790
It's not like I'm marrying a woman

58
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,513
with a bunch of crazy kids.

59
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:46,733
(peppy music)

60
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,930
- They never have anything to read.

61
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,830
Look at this, not a single tabloid.

62
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,760
- [Woman] It's a shame.

63
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,580
- You traveling on business or pleasure?

64
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,290
- [Woman] Business, you?

65
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,440
- My mother's getting married.

66
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,790
- [Woman] Well, I should
think it's about time.

67
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,493
- Re-married.

68
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:49,405
I'm Dennis Becker.

69
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,583
- Debra Schab.

70
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,820
- Debra?

71
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,720
First love of my life was named Debra.

72
00:04:56,893 --> 00:04:57,726
- Was she?

73
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,433
- So, where are you staying?

74
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,870
Ah.

75
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,320
I used to have one of those.

76
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,420
Pinched my finger, I had to get rid of it.

77
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,140
Now, back to the original
question, Mrs Schab?

78
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,990
- You don't intimidate easily, do you?

79
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:20,065
- No, I don't.

80
00:05:22,111 --> 00:05:25,194
(slower jazzy music)

81
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,716
(retching)

82
00:05:48,212 --> 00:05:50,962
(toilet flushes)

83
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,329
(melancholy music)

84
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:24,872
- Here, I've got her.

85
00:06:24,872 --> 00:06:27,039
- Well, thank you, Sister.

86
00:06:42,846 --> 00:06:43,903
- Here we go.

87
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,080
- It's kind of rough,
traveling with the kids.

88
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,140
We're going to Oklahoma to see my mom.

89
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,560
- Oh, I'm going to see my mom, too.

90
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,903
She's getting remarried.

91
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,120
- Jesse sure does like you.

92
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,100
She usually doesn't let
anybody but me pick her up.

93
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,200
- I think children know when they're safe.

94
00:07:04,627 --> 00:07:08,600
- You know, you really are a pretty lady.

95
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,900
No offense, but it's kind of hard to tell

96
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,800
with that nun thing on your head.

97
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,633
- Thank you.

98
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:19,043
(peppy music)

99
00:07:19,043 --> 00:07:20,766
- Are we going to get to Grandma's?

100
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:21,651
- I don't know, sweet pea,

101
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:24,483
we're gonna have to take this
old truck out and shoot it.

102
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,240
- Daddy, are we gonna have a new Grandpa?

103
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,073
- No, honey.

104
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,770
Hand me that 12 inch crescent.

105
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,320
Grandpa Becker is your grandpa.

106
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,610
- Is Grandpa Becker
gonna get married again?

107
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,290
- I don't think so, sweet pea.

108
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,780
Grandpa Becker is happy
with his roommate Sandy or

109
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,733
Susy or Cindy.

110
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:46,922
- Are you gonna get married again?

111
00:07:46,922 --> 00:07:50,415
- Mom and Dad never got married, stupid.

112
00:07:50,415 --> 00:07:51,617
Did you, Daddy?

113
00:07:51,617 --> 00:07:54,190
- No, baby, we never got around to that.

114
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,890
And don't call your sister stupid.

115
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,430
- That's why Mommy left.

116
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:02,073
- No, that's not why Mommy left.

117
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,150
Alright, let's give this pup a whirl.

118
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,623
Battle stations!

119
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,227
Alright, give it to her!

120
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:28,868
(engine stalls)

121
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,927
(engine turns over)

122
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:31,844
Yeah, yeah!

123
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,320
Alright, keep it pumping!

124
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,640
Hey, hey, wait a minute!

125
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,467
Amy, put on the brakes!

126
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,900
- Life is so short.

127
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,920
You have to grab it every chance you get,

128
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,473
especially when you are
young and attractive.

129
00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:56,182
- And naïve?

130
00:08:56,182 --> 00:08:57,640
(both laugh)

131
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,130
- No, no, no.

132
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,680
No, but do you understand what I mean?

133
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
About wanting it all?

134
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,710
- Yes, that's the secret, huh?

135
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,930
- I started out with nothing.

136
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,320
Now I have a condo, I drive a Bent,

137
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,410
I have a boat, I got it all

138
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,763
because I put out that intention.

139
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,660
- So what you're saying is

140
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,900
all I have to do is want
something bad enough

141
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,733
and I can get it?

142
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:22,563
- Yes, yes, it is all in the intention.

143
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,193
- You know what I want more
than anything right now?

144
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:29,926
- No.

145
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,540
- Are you gonna make me tell you?

146
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,373
- Uh-huh.

147
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,587
- Thank you.

148
00:09:42,587 --> 00:09:44,300
Now do me a favor and crawl back

149
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,483
into whatever sore you came out of.

150
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,920
- I had something a
little different in mind.

151
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,060
- I never would have guessed.

152
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,380
I swear.

153
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,030
Men are trash.

154
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,570
- Obviously, you've never met a real man.

155
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,403
- A real man?

156
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,440
I grew up with three real men.

157
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,640
I've been married to two

158
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,670
and known plenty more
in the biblical sense

159
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,000
so don't you tell me about real men.

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,053
I could write a book.

161
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,863
And incidentally, men like you
aren't even worth a footnote.

162
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,440
- You're only in town for the night?

163
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,290
- [Woman] Dennis?

164
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,303
Dennis!

165
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,310
Dennis?

166
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,143
- Annie!

167
00:10:36,122 --> 00:10:36,970
How are you?

168
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,960
- Peachy?

169
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,640
- You definitely getting divorced?

170
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,350
- Would I be staying at
Mother's if I weren't?

171
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,597
- Well,

172
00:10:43,597 --> 00:10:44,920
we all get divorced.

173
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,010
Just sort of a family tradition.

174
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:47,910
- I've got you all licked,

175
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,500
I've done it twice by 24.

176
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,570
- Yeah, but your first
lasted almost four years,

177
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,310
that's twice as long as mine.

178
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,844
- This one lasted only
three turbulent months.

179
00:10:56,844 --> 00:10:57,677
- Turbulent?

180
00:10:57,677 --> 00:10:59,273
- Very carefully chosen word.

181
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,965
What is this?

182
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:03,743
- Now don't get grabby.

183
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:08,253
The stews on the plane is
an old, dear friend of mine.

184
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,273
We're having dinner tonight.

185
00:11:13,197 --> 00:11:16,200
- Well, I got some bad news
for you, old and dear brother,

186
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,510
but Mother is waiting at home

187
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,343
with her...

188
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:21,840
- Fiance.

189
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,240
- Avoiding that word.

190
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,530
They're making dinner plans.

191
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,080
- Oh, hell, I can't change these.

192
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,923
Break her heart.

193
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,270
- Listen, I hope you're being careful

194
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:33,240
now that you're single.

195
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,600
- I protect the things I love.

196
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,230
- Spare me the details please.

197
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:41,116
- So, tell me about
this guy Mom's marrying.

198
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:42,256
- Well, what do you know about him?

199
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:44,722
- Nothing, I haven't had a
chance to talk to her about it.

200
00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:46,340
- So you don't know anything about him?

201
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,173
- No.

202
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,830
- I think you and John are
gonna have a lot to talk about.

203
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,470
(piano music)

204
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,870
- [John] What are you doing?

205
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:03,850
- Oh, when the kids were little,

206
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,810
if they made their beds
before they left for school,

207
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,233
I always left kisses on their pillows.

208
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,450
You know, Dennis now, he would always try

209
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,430
to sell his to Andrew.

210
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,220
Andrew would always hide his for later

211
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,060
then never remember where.

212
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,980
And little Anne would,
um, eat hers immediately

213
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,320
and then go crying to Mary

214
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,560
that I had never given her one
until Mary surrendered hers.

215
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,378
- It means a lot, having
them back here, doesn't it?

216
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:29,211
- Well, it's been a long time

217
00:12:29,211 --> 00:12:31,210
since we've all been
together in this house.

218
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,513
They're, um, all I've ever had, John.

219
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,030
It's important to me
how I feel about this.

220
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,270
- I know.

221
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,932
And don't worry, it's gonna be just fine.

222
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,028
(glass shatters)

223
00:12:47,028 --> 00:12:48,361
- What was that?

224
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,203
It's Grandma Fanny's fudge bowl.

225
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,190
She got it at her wedding.

226
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,000
- We're terribly sorry, we'll replace it.

227
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,640
And don't worry about the omen,

228
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,473
those are old wives' tales.

229
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,413
- Don't ask.

230
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,683
- Alright, don't ask.

231
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,840
- [Dennis] So is Mary here yet?

232
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,733
- [Anne] No, our Sister of
a sister is taking the bus.

233
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,693
And Andrew gets in tonight.

234
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,920
- Ah, it'll never change.

235
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,395
- Except for Bambi in front.

236
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:45,696
(Dennis laughs)

237
00:13:45,696 --> 00:13:47,470
- Where did those come from?

238
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,530
- John bought 'em for Mother

239
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,303
to give the place a woodsy look.

240
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,160
I swear, I'm living in Wild
Kingdom with Marlon and Jeff.

241
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,890
- They're, uh, nice.

242
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,990
- That's polite.

243
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:58,990
I'd like to get a rifle

244
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,373
and blow this menagerie to ceramic heaven.

245
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,343
- Dennis.

246
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,780
- Hey, Mom!

247
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,650
- Oh, I was so afraid
you wouldn't make it!

248
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,320
- And miss the blushing bride?

249
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,259
- [Workman] Alright,
give me a hand, will you?

250
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:13,482
- [Dennis] You look great.
- [Margret] Thank you.

251
00:14:13,482 --> 00:14:15,530
- Whoa, I see you didn't
go cheap, that's good.

252
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,730
A man who marries my mother
had better have money.

253
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,800
Oh, look, I want you
guys to do a great job.

254
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,710
This is a very special day for my mother.

255
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,800
And I want it to be perfect, okay?

256
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,748
- [Anne] Dennis.

257
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:28,206
- [Dennis] Make sure that happens.

258
00:14:28,206 --> 00:14:30,470
- [Anne] Dennis.
- What?!

259
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,303
- Dennis.

260
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,153
This is John.

261
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,353
- John who?

262
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,563
- John Hicks, the man I'm marrying.

263
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,763
- It's nice to meet you finally.

264
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,160
- Make sure you get your money back.

265
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,360
- Oh, here.

266
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,860
Welcome home.

267
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,513
You're exactly the way
your mother described you.

268
00:14:55,138 --> 00:14:56,743
- Yeah, you too.

269
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,630
- Well, I guess this is
goodbye, Sister Mary.

270
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,640
- Oh, just Mary.

271
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,850
- Mary, I always liked that name.

272
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,300
It was my grandma's.

273
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,910
It means the sea of life.

274
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,879
- Really?

275
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:20,003
- That's what my grandma told me.

276
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,407
Well, have a good time at that wedding.

277
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:23,220
And don't get nervous!

278
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,990
You ain't the one getting married.

279
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,203
- No, that's true.

280
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,966
Well, you take care of
these beautiful babies.

281
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:30,221
- Yes.

282
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,638
Come here, honey.

283
00:15:32,857 --> 00:15:34,190
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

284
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:38,136
- [Boy] Bye.
- Bye-bye.

285
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,923
- No, Mom, it's just, it's just,

286
00:15:45,923 --> 00:15:48,470
he's so young, I'm sorry.

287
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,930
But it's just kind of strange to me.

288
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,230
- He isn't marrying me
for my money, Dennis.

289
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,204
- No, it's the sex, Mother.

290
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,037
- [Margret] Anne.

291
00:15:56,037 --> 00:15:58,310
- Your mother is a beautiful woman.

292
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:01,290
I don't think about her age, our age.

293
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,310
It really doesn't matter
when you feel the way we do.

294
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,960
- [Dennis] How old are you again?

295
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,913
- I'm 39.

296
00:16:08,823 --> 00:16:11,030
- Oh, that's not much
older than you, Dennis.

297
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,680
- Thanks, Anne.

298
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,850
- You know, we have given
this some thought, Dennis.

299
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,760
All of it.

300
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,050
- And you're just gonna tell
me that it doesn't matter?

301
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,820
- It doesn't to me.

302
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,187
- And when you're 56, and Mom is 70,

303
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:24,900
and all your pals are hitting

304
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,793
on girls Anne's age, what then?

305
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,333
- I'll still love your mother.

306
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,970
- Well, all I can say is if you're happy,

307
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,263
if you're both happy, then I'm happy.

308
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,373
- Margret, are you happy?

309
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,940
- Deliriously. Are you?

310
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,773
- Mm.

311
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:47,713
- [Together] We're happy.

312
00:17:03,066 --> 00:17:03,983
- You okay?

313
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,413
- Yeah, Mom, fine.

314
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,520
- I wish I'd told you before,

315
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,833
but it just never seemed
right on the phone.

316
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,620
It's really important
to me that you like him.

317
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:23,530
- I like him because he
seems to really love you.

318
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:26,010
Just kind of hard to look at him is all.

319
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,780
Just gotta give me some time, Mom.

320
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,450
This isn't gonna be an easy road for you.

321
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,480
Especially as you get older.

322
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,040
- I know.

323
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,007
- You gonna be able to
deal with it, all the

324
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:41,300
comments and the snide remarks and looks?

325
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,490
- I'll let you know
when I get there, Denny.

326
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,210
If I get there.

327
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,203
First I have to live through a wedding.

328
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,660
- Oh, the truth is I haven't seen you look

329
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,480
this happy in long time.

330
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,133
He must be doing something right.

331
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,740
- Hey, we're all going out to dinner.

332
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,570
- Oh, Mom, I can't, I made plans.

333
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,403
- Denny!

334
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:08,033
- I wish I had known,
Mom, I can't break these.

335
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,210
- Okay.

336
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,043
- Thanks.

337
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,240
Now comes the real test,
can I borrow your car?

338
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,003
- Keys are in my purse.

339
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,533
- Thanks, Ma.

340
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:28,923
(crickets chirp)

341
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,490
- A day and a half.

342
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,590
- [Margret] Oh, there's
so much left to do.

343
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,150
- I got it all organized and
the caterers have my list

344
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,033
so don't worry.

345
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:46,230
I'm sorry Dennis couldn't
go out with us tonight.

346
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,870
But it's nice to just
be home here with you.

347
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,773
- Isn't it?

348
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,363
- Come here.

349
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,713
- Ah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

350
00:19:00,713 --> 00:19:04,150
(sentimental music)

351
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,500
- I hope what he said
earlier didn't scare you.

352
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,180
- But doesn't it you?

353
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,416
- Hm, a little.

354
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,540
- [Margret] He said he hasn't seen me

355
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,553
this happy in a long time.

356
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,840
- Well, marriage can do that for you.

357
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,743
- Yeah, or not.

358
00:19:26,112 --> 00:19:27,630
Where you going, Annie?

359
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,480
- I think I'm too old to answer that.

360
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:42,350
- [Andrew] You tired of driving yet, baby?

361
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,183
- No.

362
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,260
- We got a big day tomorrow,

363
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,360
maybe you had better get some sleep

364
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,070
or your little butt's
gonna be dragging, huh?

365
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,423
- Just a while longer.

366
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,730
Sing me that song, Daddy.

367
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,985
- What song?

368
00:19:55,985 --> 00:19:57,690
- That one you sing me and Amy.

369
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,483
- Oh, that song.

00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:06,759

(crickets chirp)

382
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,623
- Tony?

383
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,422
Hi.

384
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:54,255
- What the hell are you doing here?

385
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:56,167
- Well, I thought, maybe you were--

386
00:20:57,753 --> 00:20:58,586
- You should have called first.

387
00:20:58,586 --> 00:21:00,380
- Yeah, I came to get my clothes,

388
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,973
this is still my apartment.

389
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,393
Don't get up.

390
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:06,720
- [Tony] You checking up on me?

391
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,980
- You were screwing around the day

392
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,900
after we got married, I'm used to it.

393
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,953
- Hey, look, I want you out of here.

394
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:13,050
- And I want you run over by a bus.

395
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,679
If I could see it, I'd
call it a fair trade.

396
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:16,490
- That's enough.

397
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,790
- I wish they could have been closer,

398
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,893
but they just all went
their own directions.

399
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,946
- Well, it's not necessarily bad.

400
00:21:23,946 --> 00:21:24,779
- You know, sometimes I feel like

401
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:26,473
they don't even know each other.

402
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:29,770
That's why I want them to feel like

403
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,073
our family is their family.

404
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:32,570
I want 'em to have that.

405
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,145
- [John] Our home will
always be open to them,

406
00:21:34,145 --> 00:21:35,640
you know that.

407
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,190
- I wish I could give you kids.

408
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,873
No, I don't.

409
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,200
- Just worry about being a wife, okay?

410
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,280
- [Margret] Dennis is
right, you could be my son.

411
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,533
- I don't want a mother.

412
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,053
I want a wife.

413
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,360
- Denny, that you?

414
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,930
- [Anne] No, it's me, Mom.

415
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,090
- We're making omelets, you want--

416
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,490
you went over to Tony's, didn't you?

417
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,715
I'm calling the police.

418
00:22:03,715 --> 00:22:04,800
- No, Mom, he's working.

419
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,270
Mom, you're not calling them.

420
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:08,130
- Oh the hell I'm not?

421
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:09,890
He's lucky if I don't kill him myself.

422
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,690
- Don't get your panties in a bunch.

423
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,600
I never should have gone over there.

424
00:22:18,456 --> 00:22:19,289
- Baby.

425
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:21,400
You need some ice.

426
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,183
- And a glass with some scotch.

427
00:22:27,606 --> 00:22:28,439
Mom.

428
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:33,653
Why do the Becker women have
such rotten luck with men?

429
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,750
Oh.

430
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,793
Oh, I'm sorry.

431
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:48,702
(crickets chirp)

432
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,123
- Dinner was wonderful, thanks for asking.

433
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,733
Anne.

434
00:23:15,847 --> 00:23:17,193
What the hell happened to you?

435
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:20,921
- She went over to Tony's.

436
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,271
- This is how we say hello.

437
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,740
Mom, would you go to bed, please?

438
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,860
You got a busy day tomorrow.

439
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,773
- So do you.

440
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,830
- Look, all I'm gonna do
is have a drink with Denny.

441
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:35,280
And then, if you'll forgive
the pun, I'll hit it.

442
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:40,250
- I worry about you, baby.

443
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,950
- Yeah, I worry about me too, Mom.

444
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,540
- Someday, you're gonna meet a man

445
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,997
who's right for you, Annie.

446
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,740
- The only man I wanna worry
about right now is Denny.

447
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,033
Scotch?
- Yeah, sure.

448
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:57,490
- Don't drink too much,

449
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,800
tomorrow's gonna be a long one.

450
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,750
- Yeah, don't sweat Mom, we'll be fine.

451
00:24:03,232 --> 00:24:04,399
- Don't do it.

452
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,183
Night!

453
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,263
- Night, Mom.

454
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,633
- He hit you?

455
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:20,373
- Um, yes.

456
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,110
You don't get these from kissing.

457
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,743
It's, um,

458
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,063
it's not the first time.

459
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:32,420
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna pay old Tony

460
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,620
a little visit tomorrow
with a baseball bat.

461
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,400
- Look, leave him alone.

462
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,373
It's my fault.

463
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,990
- [Dennis] How can you even think that?

464
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,163
- Because I gravitate towards pigs.

465
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,510
- There's a term for that, Annie.

466
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,883
- Yeah, bad taste.

467
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,500
And I just keep running back for more.

468
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,933
And right now, I just wanna get divorced.

469
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:04,933
(sentimental music)

470
00:25:14,566 --> 00:25:17,399
- Trizzle trazzle, trizzle travel.

471
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:21,350
Time for this one to come home.

472
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,077
Welcome home, Andy.

473
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:36,397
Welcome home.

474
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,890
- [Dennis] He's not still here, is he?

475
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:43,790
- Are you kidding?

476
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,660
No, he stopped sleeping
over when I moved back in.

477
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,650
Sometimes I tell him I'll be back at one

478
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:54,860
and then show up at midnight,
just so I can catch him.

479
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,693
- Payback.

480
00:25:56,924 --> 00:25:57,757
(Anne belches)

481
00:25:57,757 --> 00:26:00,464
Oh, nice, took a lot out of you.

482
00:26:00,464 --> 00:26:01,297
Get any on me?

483
00:26:01,297 --> 00:26:03,163
- Oh, I am sorry.

484
00:26:04,375 --> 00:26:05,208
Well, that was real ladylike.

485
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:07,740
- You gonna throw up on me
like when you were little?

486
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,663
- I don't know, the night's still young.

487
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,943
You hear from Dad?

488
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,743
- I don't call him, he doesn't call me.

489
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,870
- You're just like him.

490
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,407
No, you are.

491
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,850
He's a sleep around kind of guy.

492
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,920
There's nothing wrong with that.

493
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,290
- Yeah, unless you're married to him.

494
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:34,420
Or an offspring.

495
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,870
- [Anne] At least he's happy.

496
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,103
- Who said I wasn't happy?

497
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,263
- I know misery.

498
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,440
I was the Queen of Misery in junior high

499
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,670
and I've been the
reigning champ ever since.

500
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:49,250
So you can save your yuppie,
I'm okay, you're okay crap

501
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,113
for someone who believe it.

502
00:26:50,113 --> 00:26:52,120
- I'm not a yuppie.

503
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:55,580
- Oh please, you are a
yuppie prince, buck-o.

504
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,963
- And what are you?

505
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,423
- Nothing.

506
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,763
A disco degenerate.

507
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,920
(engine creaks outside)

508
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,943
- Andrew?
- Mary?

509
00:27:10,983 --> 00:27:13,253
- No, no, no, Greyhound doesn't deliver.

510
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:25,743
- It's Andrew.

511
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,570
God, look at him.

512
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,657
- [Dennis] Well, open the door.

513
00:27:32,657 --> 00:27:33,940
- No.

514
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,732
No, I'm gonna get Mom.

515
00:27:35,732 --> 00:27:38,732
(sentimental music)

516
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:45,424
- Hey, hey, hey.

517
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,800
- [Andrew] Hello, stranger.

518
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,753
Good to see you.

519
00:27:51,611 --> 00:27:54,707
- Prodigal son returns, look out.

520
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,880
Oh, you're faster than you used to be.

521
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,320
- No, you're just slower.

522
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,330
- Oh, it's sad but true.

523
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,200
It's good to see you.

524
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,977
- Well, I'm hanging, I'm hanging.

525
00:28:03,977 --> 00:28:05,144
- It's Andrew!

526
00:28:07,423 --> 00:28:11,090
My kangaroo, oh, welcome
home, welcome home.

527
00:28:12,871 --> 00:28:13,704
- [Andrew] It's good to see you.

528
00:28:13,704 --> 00:28:15,246
- Yeah, you too, you too.

529
00:28:15,246 --> 00:28:16,341
Where are the girls, they asleep?

530
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:20,841
- Oh yeah, they're in the
truck, come here, come here.

531
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:33,087
- I'm putting them in
the family room, Dennis.

532
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,560
- So you haven't said hello.

533
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,900
- Hello.

534
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,750
- Oh, what happened to you?

535
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,233
- I took up face tennis.

536
00:29:03,221 --> 00:29:05,221
- They've gotten so big.

537
00:29:06,295 --> 00:29:07,128
- Mm-hmm.

538
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:12,600
Kind of puts your mortality
in perspective, doesn't it?

539
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,183
- Tell me about it.

540
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:23,870
I'm in a room full of adults
and they're all my children.

541
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,745
It's been too long since
you've been home, Andy.

542
00:29:29,745 --> 00:29:30,883
- [Andrew] Mom, don't.

543
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,830
- I want a nightcap.

544
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,880
- [Margret] Oh, Anne.

545
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,850
- What happened to her face?

546
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,370
- Her ex, Tony, hit her.

547
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:42,840
- I think we should
pay him a little visit.

548
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,130
- You boys stay out of it.

549
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,670
- [Andrew] How does Anne
always get hooked up

550
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,500
with guys like that?

551
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,400
- I heard my name.

552
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,200
- Oh, we were just saying
horrible things about you.

553
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,690
- Anne, don't you think you've had enough?

554
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,223
- Mom, relax.

555
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:05,852
You're getting a little
uptight as we near the big day.

556
00:30:05,852 --> 00:30:06,690
I have my brothers here,

557
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,140
I have a reason to celebrate.

558
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,033
So.

559
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,180
How's Florida?

560
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,143
- What, the state?

561
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,880
- I'm trying to be
cordial, don't screw it up.

562
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,230
I'm asking you how you are.

563
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,750
- Fair.

564
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,583
You know.

565
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,781
- You're still as fascinating as ever.

566
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:30,730
- What do you want to hear?
My life isn't that exciting.

567
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:33,033
- Who says, I just
figured after ten years,

568
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:35,780
we'd have, what, 15
minutes of conversation?

569
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,630
- Alright, let's not do this now.

570
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,760
I asked you kids back here to
support me, to be my family.

571
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,950
- Yeah, we are your family.

572
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:44,783
Lucky you.

573
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,380
Look, I don't know why
you dropped out of Harvard

574
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,880
and took up boat painting in Florida

575
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,270
but don't come here and
pretend like everything's cool.

576
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,973
- That's it, you to bed.

577
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,633
- Mother, I'm a little old for you to be--

578
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:03,160
- You are living under my roof

579
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,580
and you will play by my rules.

580
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,320
I'm not asking that much of you, Anne.

581
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,153
Of any of you.

582
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,360
I'm bringing a new man into this family

583
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,160
and I don't want it to be like this.

584
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,800
- Look.

585
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,340
It's late, so,

586
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,960
why don't we all just turn in.

587
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,080
- Yeah, it's late.

588
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,750
It's too late.

589
00:31:41,182 --> 00:31:44,182
(quiet piano music)

590
00:33:59,156 --> 00:34:01,656
(phone rings)

591
00:34:02,936 --> 00:34:04,930
- Yeah, hello.

592
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,863
Mary, hi.

593
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:13,800
Yeah, I just got in a while ago, uh-huh.

594
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,863
Yeah, Anne and I, we already got into it.

595
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:19,853
Yeah, right, welcome home.

596
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,713
So where are you?

597
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,500
Uh-huh.

598
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,683
Yeah, I think I remember
where that is, uh-huh.

599
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:49,631
(man clears throat)

600
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:50,464
- Andrew!

601
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,336
I've missed you.

602
00:34:56,336 --> 00:34:57,486
- I've missed you, too.

603
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:01,841
Come on, I've got the
car parked over there.

604
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,190
Judy didn't say anything when she left.

605
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,060
It was just a note that said

606
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,363
I need space.

607
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,140
Hell, we're living in South Florida,

608
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,883
how much more space do you need?

609
00:35:21,883 --> 00:35:23,877
- How are the kids handling it?

610
00:35:23,877 --> 00:35:25,430
- I don't know.

611
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,330
They don't talk it about much with me.

612
00:35:28,603 --> 00:35:30,473
But then again, maybe I
don't want to hear it.

613
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,540
Well, enough about life
in the sunshine state,

614
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,973
how are you, you look great.

615
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,513
Even in uniform.

616
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,773
- Habit.

617
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,459
- Is it?

618
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:46,082
Ba-dum-dum-ching.

619
00:35:46,082 --> 00:35:47,550
- That was a lousy set up.

620
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,423
I'm fine, really good.

621
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:53,720
- Good.

622
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,553
- Yes, good.

623
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,560
- Uh-huh.

624
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,663
Come on, tell me.

625
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:00,803
- What?

626
00:36:00,803 --> 00:36:03,530
- You have always been the worst
person at keeping a secret.

627
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,423
What are you shrouding with
that innocent smile of yours?

628
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,153
Well?

629
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:13,400
- I'm really hungry, you wanna eat?

630
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,170
- So talk.

631
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,430
- [Mary] I'm eating!

632
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:30,190
- Oh, come on, I'm sure
these patrons of fine dining

633
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,390
won't mind if you talk
with your mouth full.

634
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,963
- It's kind of involved.

635
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,933
I'm giving up my vows.

636
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:52,283
- Your vows?

637
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,340
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.

638
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,173
Your vows?

639
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,653
- I'm not going back.

640
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,490
- But you're a nun, nuns don't
just abandon their faith.

641
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,500
- It's not my faith, it's my vocation,

642
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,533
the direction of my life, I'm changing.

643
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,613
I prayed over this for a
long time, I know it's right.

644
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:20,924
- God, I hope so.

645
00:37:22,713 --> 00:37:24,553
It must take a strong woman.

646
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,770
- You wouldn't believe.

647
00:37:32,829 --> 00:37:33,662
But.

648
00:37:36,573 --> 00:37:38,350
- [Andrew] But what?

649
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:40,930
- I haven't told Mom yet.

650
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,490
I was gonna tell her this weekend,

651
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:44,810
I don't have any other
place to go right now.

652
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:46,120
- You haven't told Mom yet?

653
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,183
- No, and you're not gonna tell her.

654
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,430
I wanna tell her when the time is right,

655
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:52,688
she has enough on her mind right now.

656
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,840
- Yeah, well don't sweat me telling her.

657
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,910
You just promise you won't say anything

658
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,623
until I'm miles away from here.

659
00:38:01,326 --> 00:38:03,367
You know, she's always
been real proud of you.

660
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:12,860
Oh, Mary, this is gonna kill her.

661
00:38:17,485 --> 00:38:19,985
(birds chirp)

662
00:38:23,048 --> 00:38:23,981
- [Margret] Annie?

663
00:38:23,981 --> 00:38:26,830
- No thanks, Mother, maybe some toast.

664
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:27,663
- I'll take it.

665
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,140
- Thanks.

666
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,140
- [Margret] Morning.

667
00:38:33,219 --> 00:38:34,274
- Denny!

668
00:38:34,274 --> 00:38:35,973
- Hey, Mary, how are you?

669
00:38:35,973 --> 00:38:38,300
- [Mary] Glad to be home.

670
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,723
- She was up at 6:30
this morning throwing up.

671
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,620
Andrew took her out for hamburgers.

672
00:38:45,426 --> 00:38:47,313
- And how are we feeling this morning?

673
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,730
- Groovy.

674
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,313
Remind me to murder you.

675
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,673
- Amy, Jersey, breakfast!

676
00:38:58,768 --> 00:39:00,723
- How do we say good morning, ladies?

677
00:39:00,723 --> 00:39:02,480
- [Together] Good morning!

678
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,796
- They're beautiful, Andrew.

679
00:39:03,796 --> 00:39:04,629
- Oh, thanks.

680
00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:06,783
- Daddy, what are all
those things on the wall

681
00:39:06,783 --> 00:39:08,550
with your name on them?

682
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,770
- Your scholastic awards.

683
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,170
- Oh, why don't you get rid of those?

684
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,610
- Those were given to your
Daddy for being smart.

685
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:16,730
- You were smart?

686
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,813
- Yeah, baby, a long time ago.

687
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,869
- Hey, what do you say after breakfast

688
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:24,073
we go shopping for dresses?

689
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:25,567
- [Together] Yeah!

690
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:27,083
- At Discount Barn?

691
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,820
- No, someplace else.

692
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,060
Go and eat your breakfast.

693
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,120
- Thank you, Grandma.

694
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,290
- Oh, you never know when
those blue light specials

695
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:41,240
are gonna pop up in aisle six, huh, Andy?

696
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,310
- I don't want you to buy them
a bunch of junk today, Mom.

697
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,470
- That's a grandmother's privilege.

698
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,063
- God, aren't weddings fun?

699
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,640
I'm planning on having
one every three years

700
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,490
so I can keep up with the
latest in household appliances.

701
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,513
- Food!

702
00:39:54,513 --> 00:39:56,310
I haven't eaten since the plane yesterday.

703
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,200
- I thought you had dinner
with a friend last night.

704
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:05,330
- Yes, Dennis, I thought you
had dinner with a friend.

705
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,700
- We sort of got sidetracked.

706
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,040
Pass the cream, please.

707
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,560
- I'll bet you did.

708
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,260
- John, does he have a family?

709
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,173
- Uh-uh, no, he's an only child.

710
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,010
Gosh, just think this time tomorrow night,

711
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:23,593
I'll be a married woman again.

712
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,430
I hope you're all going to accept John.

713
00:40:32,418 --> 00:40:34,190
- As long as he's good to you.

714
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,640
- If he doesn't sleep
around on you like Dad did.

715
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,713
- Try chewing, Mary.

716
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,810
- I'm making a pig out of myself.

717
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,420
- No, you're not, you eat.

718
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,840
You're too thin.

719
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,780
- I tried to put a few
pounds on her last night,

720
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:55,259
but I guess she just can't
handle her cheeseburgers, huh?

721
00:40:55,259 --> 00:40:58,333
- Well, hell, the boat
painter makes a stab at humor.

722
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,823
- Anne, get off his back.

723
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,590
- Why is it every time
I say anything to Andy,

724
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,263
somebody cuts me off?

725
00:41:09,114 --> 00:41:10,340
I mean, we all want to
know what he's been doing

726
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,220
the last ten years, I'm not afraid to ask.

727
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,900
- It's his business.

728
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,920
- Well, Mom, I'm sorry.

729
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,530
I thought we were
supposed to act the family

730
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:19,490
for the next few days.

731
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:20,860
- We are a family.

732
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,460
- Mother, please, this is
a table full of strangers.

733
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:26,623
- Can we just eat, please?

734
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,690
- Look, you may all
think I'm the bitch here,

735
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:35,970
and I really don't care,

736
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,270
but let's at least come
clean with each other.

737
00:41:39,746 --> 00:41:40,980
- I'm gonna go eat with my girls.

738
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,700
- You stay right where you are!

739
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,683
And you, shut up!

740
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,560
Everybody else, eat.

741
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:54,803
Eat!

742
00:41:57,208 --> 00:42:00,125
(clink of cutlery)

743
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,670
- Mom, is this really the way you want it?

744
00:42:09,382 --> 00:42:10,215
(Margret slams glass)

745
00:42:10,215 --> 00:42:11,703
- None of this is the way I want it.

746
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,470
- We're really making this
easy on her, aren't we?

747
00:42:43,816 --> 00:42:47,149
(car engine turns over)

748
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,963
Morning.
- Morning.

749
00:43:03,162 --> 00:43:04,180
- [Man In Sports Car]
I'll see you later, honey.

750
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,842
- What time will you be home?

751
00:43:05,842 --> 00:43:07,092
- Right after my meeting.

752
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:13,893
- Have a nice jog.

753
00:43:15,389 --> 00:43:18,722
(dogs bark in distance)

754
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:25,530
- Well, he's younger and I'm
not 100% sure about everything.

755
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,450
But I love him

756
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,270
and I'm committed to him.

757
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,420
I know you understand that.

758
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,610
You've certainly stuck with your calling

759
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,110
and I'm proud of you for that.

760
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,563
- It hasn't been easy.

761
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:41,763
- I guess it never is.

762
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,350
I'm scared.

763
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,190
You know, when your father left,

764
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:49,440
I just never thought
this would happen again.

765
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:53,993
And now, John's giving me a second chance.

766
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,410
I really want it to work

767
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:59,480
and maybe I'm crazy but I sort of wanted

768
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,150
my kids behind me in this, you know,

769
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:02,720
not blocking my way.

770
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,680
Don't put that away, we're
gonna use it at the reception.

771
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,950
- Mother, we love each other,

772
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:08,550
it's just hard because we
haven't been together for so long

773
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,220
and it takes time to readjust.

774
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,250
- I know.

775
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:13,220
And I do think I was
planning on using you all

776
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:16,303
to fall back on, which
isn't fair of me either.

777
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,883
But, you're all I've got, except for John.

778
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,173
He's unflappable.

779
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,720
- You deserve somebody like that.

780
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:28,903
- You.

781
00:44:29,763 --> 00:44:30,834
Oh, you.

782
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,270
(sentimental music)

783
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,483
You're a lot like him, you know that.

784
00:44:44,198 --> 00:44:45,531
- Need any help?

785
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:48,901
- Know anything about old Fords?

786
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:50,760
- Ah, sure, where the key goes

787
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,280
and where to put out the cigarette.

788
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,163
- Yeah, that's just what I thought.

789
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:57,683
- Hey.

790
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,683
Andy, about this garbage
with Anne, why don't,

791
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,680
why don't you make up?

792
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:05,593
For Mom's sake.

793
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,721
- No problem with that.

794
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:10,671
As long as Anne minds her own business.

795
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:13,600
- Just think about it, alright?

796
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,430
It's too bad we all weren't closer,

797
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,061
make these family deals a lot easier.

798
00:45:19,061 --> 00:45:20,943
- Yeah, well, at least
we don't sit around,

799
00:45:20,943 --> 00:45:22,693
telling each other lies.

800
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,757
- I spent half my life lying to myself.

801
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:30,274
The other half trying to believe it.

802
00:45:30,274 --> 00:45:32,820
- [Andy] Yeah, I can't lie anymore.

803
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,053
Girls call me on it.

804
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,477
Kids are good at that.

805
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:40,043
- I want you to see this.

806
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,490
Where were neighbors like
this when we were growing up?

807
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,150
Man, I'll tell you, ever
since Pam and I split,

808
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,613
I just, I can't get enough.

809
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:55,280
- Yeah, Judy leaving had
the opposite effect on me.

810
00:45:57,670 --> 00:45:59,353
Well, don't let me stop you.

811
00:45:59,353 --> 00:46:01,810
Just see if you can
get your horns clipped.

812
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,590
Doesn't work,

813
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,040
well,

814
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,440
I'll leave the cold water
in the shower running.

815
00:46:12,108 --> 00:46:15,108
(car engine grates)

816
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:34,600
- Here.

817
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,278
What do you think?

818
00:46:36,278 --> 00:46:38,460
Well, actually, this is yours.
- Mom, they're beautiful.

819
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,293
- You don't hate 'em?

820
00:46:39,293 --> 00:46:40,707
- No, they're great!

821
00:46:40,707 --> 00:46:42,752
- Oh, I just think you'll
look wonderful in 'em.

822
00:46:42,752 --> 00:46:44,770
- [Amy] Nana, Nana, how do we look?

823
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,290
- Oh, get out here,
turn around, let's see.

824
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:48,123
Look at that.

825
00:46:48,123 --> 00:46:49,663
- I think you guys look great.

826
00:46:49,663 --> 00:46:50,687
- I do too!

827
00:46:50,687 --> 00:46:52,250
- Do we get to keep these dresses?

828
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:54,700
- [Margret] Well of course, they're yours!

829
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,770
- Their father can use them
as rags to clean a boat.

830
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,670
And, okay, Mom, I'll tell you what,

831
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:01,827
we'll try these on, see how they fit.

832
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,834
- Wanna look at some more dresses?

833
00:47:04,834 --> 00:47:05,667
- [Girls] Yeah!

834
00:47:05,667 --> 00:47:08,060
- I don't know why she
didn't take me with her

835
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,210
when she picked these out.

836
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:10,990
We're gonna look like
we're going to the prom.

837
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:13,290
- Oh, it's just one day, we'll survive.

838
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:14,523
This is pretty.

839
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,193
- Yeah.

840
00:47:17,314 --> 00:47:18,313
If you got no hips.

841
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,320
I'd look like I was wearing a Volkswagen.

842
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:25,000
It'd look good on you, though.

843
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,130
- Maybe I'll buy it.

844
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,993
- Well, now, what would you
do with that? Seduce a priest?

845
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,110
- I'm not going back.

846
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:37,943
- Where?

847
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:40,980
- The convent.

848
00:47:45,034 --> 00:47:47,860
- Do I want to hear this?

849
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,693
(emotional music)

850
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,683
- Okay, I wanna know.

851
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,780
How can you just not go back?

852
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:09,930
- It's a long story.

853
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:11,723
- Well, I got all afternoon.

854
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:19,080
(Mary sighs)

855
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,693
- I'm pregnant.

856
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,013
- You're pregnant.

857
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,050
That's a pretty good
reason to not go back.

858
00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:37,113
Mary, you're a nun.

859
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,143
How can you be pregnant?

860
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,053
I guess this is the long story.

861
00:49:47,434 --> 00:49:49,053
This is, this is crazy.

862
00:49:49,053 --> 00:49:51,653
I mean, you're pregnant and
you're skinnier than me.

863
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:54,323
- I'm starting to show a little.

864
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,980
- Who's the father?

865
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,380
- After I decided to go,

866
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:03,640
I met a man working with
kids at the mission.

867
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,973
He's very nice.

868
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,453
- I'm sure.

869
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:10,570
Yeah, I always think very highly

870
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:13,893
of any man who deflowers a
27-year-old ex-nun virgin.

871
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:17,980
Are you gonna marry this guy?

872
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:21,653
- No.

873
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,790
- Um, I wanna

874
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:31,033
drink and a cigarette.

875
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,563
Mary, what do you know
about raising a kid?

876
00:50:38,166 --> 00:50:40,480
What do you know about getting a job?

877
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,320
And surviving in the world?

878
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,592
You've been a nun for eight years.

879
00:50:44,592 --> 00:50:47,526
(emotional music)

880
00:50:47,526 --> 00:50:49,810
This is, this is crazy.

881
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:50,960
The dress looks great.

882
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,113
Get changed, okay?

883
00:50:53,463 --> 00:50:54,296
- Anne.

884
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,191
Anne, what did I say?

885
00:50:59,191 --> 00:51:00,024
- Nothing.

886
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:11,393
I've been married twice.

887
00:51:13,416 --> 00:51:15,533
And I don't have anything to show for it.

888
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,880
Except a couple of bruises

889
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:21,063
and this

890
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,253
annoying

891
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:25,643
sense of humor.

892
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,554
And you come waltzing back home,

893
00:51:32,554 --> 00:51:33,471
no husband,

894
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:38,853
and you're having a baby.

895
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:43,950
I want something in my life

896
00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:45,847
to work out.

897
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:52,401
I want something to hold on to.

898
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,503
- Annie, that's what this baby is for me.

899
00:51:59,837 --> 00:52:02,223
- But you always had your faith.

900
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,470
- I still have that.

901
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,900
But I want more.

902
00:52:09,257 --> 00:52:11,370
I want to bring life into the world,

903
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:13,277
is there something wrong with that?

904
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:16,983
- No.

905
00:52:21,506 --> 00:52:22,339
No.

906
00:52:24,753 --> 00:52:26,590
I guess I just wish

907
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,993
I had the guts to get what I want.

908
00:52:41,761 --> 00:52:45,210
- [Mary] You haven't hugged
me like this for a long time.

909
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:46,043
- Well.

910
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:50,510
You've never been pregnant before.

911
00:52:58,364 --> 00:53:00,114
I'll break your back.

912
00:53:01,736 --> 00:53:04,182
- [Margret] Mary, Anne?

913
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:05,209
- Yeah?

914
00:53:05,209 --> 00:53:07,444
- [Margret] Oh, how are
the dresses, do they fit?

915
00:53:07,444 --> 00:53:11,370
- Uh, mine does, I'm not
to sure about Mary's.

916
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:12,670
- No, mine fits fine, Mom.

917
00:53:14,848 --> 00:53:16,830
- If it's too big, we can have it altered.

918
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:17,851
- No, it's fine.

919
00:53:17,851 --> 00:53:20,434
(Mary cackles)

920
00:53:25,977 --> 00:53:28,282
- [Andrew] Well, well, well.

921
00:53:28,282 --> 00:53:31,265
- Daddy, you should see all
the stuff Grandma got us.

922
00:53:31,265 --> 00:53:33,447
- Yeah, you should see all the stuff.

923
00:53:33,447 --> 00:53:34,577
- [Amy] Come see the dresses, Papa!

924
00:53:34,577 --> 00:53:36,483
- Oh, in a second, sweet pea!

925
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,430
I asked you not to buy
them a bunch of junk today.

926
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:45,770
- Well, I'm just making up for lost time.

927
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,190
I never get to see them, Andrew.

928
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,630
- I know, but I can't
get them a lot of things,

929
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:51,450
it makes it hard on me.

930
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:53,200
They've got what they
need, they're happy kids.

931
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,460
- A couple of dresses
isn't going to spoil them.

932
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:58,030
- Well, I taught them the many advantages

933
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:58,960
of the credit card.

934
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,140
They were amazed at how naturally

935
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,820
I abused my charging privileges.

936
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,570
It got them very excited.

937
00:54:03,570 --> 00:54:06,270
- Well, I guess everybody
needs something, don't they?

938
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,703
- It's rough having such
shallow relatives, huh, Plato?

939
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,660
Keep an eye on your mailbox.

940
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,600
I filled out the applications for 'em.

941
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,450
Cards should be there within a month.

942
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,410
- Don't let her get to you.

943
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:23,773
- Be alright, Mom.

944
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:25,723
- Mrs. Becker?

945
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:27,813
We have a problem.

946
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:30,080
- Oh, how nice.

947
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,830
Thank you for coming to me with it.

948
00:54:33,474 --> 00:54:36,385
I'll be so glad when this is over.

949
00:54:36,385 --> 00:54:37,218
- [Workman] You know that gazebo

950
00:54:37,218 --> 00:54:38,293
that's supposed to be done by tomorrow?

951
00:54:38,293 --> 00:54:39,690
- [Mary] Andy, can you give me a hand?

952
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:40,523
- Yeah.

953
00:54:47,835 --> 00:54:49,651
Oh my God, Dennis is in there.

954
00:54:49,651 --> 00:54:50,484
- Where?

955
00:54:50,484 --> 00:54:51,600
- In the house!

956
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,864
- [Mary] What's he doing in there?

957
00:54:52,864 --> 00:54:55,040
- He's about to get his head
smashed in, that's what!

958
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,713
He's with that guy's wife!

959
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,990
I got to get Denny out of there.

960
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:00,720
You keep that guy busy.

961
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:01,553
- How?

962
00:55:01,553 --> 00:55:02,620
- I don't know!

963
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:03,620
Seduce him.

964
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,100
- I don't know how!

965
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,973
- Well fake it, okay?

966
00:55:13,033 --> 00:55:15,166
- Excuse me!

967
00:55:15,166 --> 00:55:15,999
Excuse me!

968
00:55:16,983 --> 00:55:18,284
Excuse me!

969
00:55:18,284 --> 00:55:20,074
Hi.

970
00:55:20,074 --> 00:55:22,283
I just love your house.

971
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:24,880
It's a great color.

972
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,778
- Funny, most of the neighbors hate it.

973
00:55:27,778 --> 00:55:29,320
- Really?

974
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:32,710
Because I think that that color says

975
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:36,113
that you're a man of
strength and conviction.

976
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:37,983
- Previous owner painted it.

977
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:41,530
- Oh, and look at your
lawn, it's so beautiful!

978
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:45,203
I mean, you must really take
care of the things you love.

979
00:55:49,477 --> 00:55:51,810
(dog barks)

980
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,193
- You're such a jerk.

981
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:00,290
And I can be a bitch.

982
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,290
- The sleekness and the lines!

983
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:11,140
- Stop rubbing it, please,

984
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,680
I just hand waxed this Sunday, please.

985
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,793
- Hand waxed, I knew it!

986
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:16,833
Is it fast?

987
00:56:16,833 --> 00:56:18,463
- Of course it's fast.

988
00:56:18,463 --> 00:56:19,880
- I love it fast.

989
00:56:23,909 --> 00:56:24,742
- What, are you nuts?

990
00:56:24,742 --> 00:56:25,575
Get out of my car.

991
00:56:26,442 --> 00:56:29,942
(suspenseful synth music)

992
00:56:35,537 --> 00:56:37,037
- [Andrew] Dennis!

993
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,565
Dennis!

994
00:56:39,565 --> 00:56:40,815
- This is nice!

995
00:56:42,037 --> 00:56:45,780
And leather, real leather, I love leather!

996
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:47,960
- Mary, what are you doing?

997
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,060
- Annie, come and look at this leather.

998
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,940
Go ahead, touch it!

999
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:56,233
I have never felt leather
like this before in my life!

1000
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:57,066
Get in!

1001
00:56:57,066 --> 00:56:59,751
- Can you get her out of my car please?

1002
00:56:59,751 --> 00:57:00,584
- Whee!

1003
00:57:02,171 --> 00:57:03,708
- Mom!

1004
00:57:03,708 --> 00:57:04,541
- Whoopee!

1005
00:57:13,789 --> 00:57:16,539
(toilet flushes)

1006
00:57:18,446 --> 00:57:19,279
- Dennis!

1007
00:57:20,448 --> 00:57:21,938
(Dennis and woman moaning)

1008
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:22,771
Dennis!

1009
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:28,760
Dennis!

1010
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,093
(Mary makes car noises)

1011
00:57:34,814 --> 00:57:36,070
- Mary, what are you doing?

1012
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:39,513
- I can feel the wind
whipping through my hair!

1013
00:57:40,354 --> 00:57:43,730
(Mary continues to make car noises)

1014
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:44,727
- Mary, I want you to get out

1015
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:46,640
of Mr. Haverson's car and come home.

1016
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,090
- Mom, get in, all of you, get in!

1017
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,740
And we'll cruise the river front!

1018
00:57:56,909 --> 00:57:57,742
- Dennis!

1019
00:57:58,585 --> 00:58:01,002
- [Dennis] Andy, is that you?

1020
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,410
- Her husband's home, come on!

1021
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:04,283
- [Woman] Mark?

1022
00:58:04,283 --> 00:58:06,337
Oh God, he'll kill us!

1023
00:58:06,337 --> 00:58:07,408
- The washing machine was great,

1024
00:58:07,408 --> 00:58:08,852
we'll have to do the dryer next time.

1025
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:09,685
- Come on.

1026
00:58:11,152 --> 00:58:12,569
Nice to meet you.

1027
00:58:15,077 --> 00:58:16,950
- Oh, I just love this car.

1028
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:17,900
Mom, get in

1029
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:20,960
and we'll burn some
rubber down the driveway.

1030
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,903
- I want you to tell me
what in Hades' is going on!

1031
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:26,053
Mary.

1032
00:58:28,802 --> 00:58:29,635
Mary.

1033
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:41,190
- I wanted to go driving.

1034
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:43,080
But since no one will go with me,

1035
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,130
I'll just go home and take my medication.

1036
00:58:49,410 --> 00:58:50,833
- Oh, Mr. Haverson.

1037
00:58:53,610 --> 00:58:54,623
Don't have kids.

1038
00:58:59,528 --> 00:59:00,611
- [Anne] Bye.

1039
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,223
- You owe me, you owe me big.

1040
00:59:08,223 --> 00:59:09,573
- You, in the house.

1041
00:59:10,913 --> 00:59:12,683
- [Mary] Not a chance, not a chance!

1042
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:18,223
- This family is totally beyond me.

1043
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:22,093
Especially you.

1044
00:59:33,604 --> 00:59:36,500
(door slams)

1045
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,960
- One more day.

1046
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,160
Alright, just one more,

1047
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,120
and that's all I ask.

1048
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,133
And I'm not even gonna
ask what you were doing.

1049
00:59:41,133 --> 00:59:42,669
- Well, I'll tell you, Mom--

1050
00:59:42,669 --> 00:59:44,025
- I said I don't want to know.

1051
00:59:44,025 --> 00:59:45,655
- That's what I was gonna tell you, Mom,

1052
00:59:45,655 --> 00:59:46,488
you don't want to know.

1053
00:59:46,488 --> 00:59:48,180
- No, you don't want to know.

1054
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,830
- I thought I could count on you.

1055
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:53,680
How do you expect those
other two to behave

1056
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,190
if you two are acting like...

1057
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,600
Will you just act normal?

1058
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,233
Especially you, Mary, set an example.

1059
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,080
- I'm sorry, Mom.

1060
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,720
- Mrs. Becker?

1061
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,520
What should we do with these things?

1062
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,190
- Alright, I'm counting on you.

1063
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:17,810
Now I have to go tell these men

1064
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:20,029
what to do with their things.

1065
01:00:20,029 --> 01:00:22,060
(both chortle)

1066
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:24,340
- You weren't gonna tell her?

1067
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:25,173
- Crazy!

1068
01:00:25,173 --> 01:00:26,220
I had a great story.

1069
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,383
- You always did.

1070
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:35,050
- You used to push me for hours out here.

1071
01:00:35,050 --> 01:00:36,160
- It's because if I stopped,

1072
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,510
you'd tell Mom or Dad I hit you.

1073
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:40,060
- Hey.

1074
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:40,893
Push me.

1075
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:55,280
- How are you fitting your
butt on that little seat?

1076
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,320
- You shut and push or I'm
gotta tell Mom you hit me.

1077
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:05,090
(peaceful music)

1078
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:05,923
Andy.

1079
01:01:07,159 --> 01:01:07,992
- Yeah?

1080
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,483
- Why did you stay down there?

1081
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,643
- I was tired.

1082
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:16,663
- You know,

1083
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,743
when Dad left, you were my security.

1084
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:24,540
Been looking for that in a man ever since.

1085
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:29,883
You hurt me when you fell apart.

1086
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:37,703
- I didn't fall apart.

1087
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:51,380
Do you know what it's
like to spend your life

1088
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,593
living up to someone else's expectations?

1089
01:01:57,890 --> 01:01:59,223
I'm not a failure.

1090
01:02:00,535 --> 01:02:01,490
At least I don't feel like one

1091
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:02,630
until I start looking at myself

1092
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,263
through everybody else's eyes.

1093
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:07,683
Dammit, I'm happy.

1094
01:02:09,681 --> 01:02:12,243
I have two great kids I
love more than life itself.

1095
01:02:13,973 --> 01:02:15,870
I like Florida and what I do.

1096
01:02:17,747 --> 01:02:19,597
Isn't being happy what really counts?

1097
01:02:21,449 --> 01:02:22,282
- I don't know.

1098
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:25,920
I don't know much about happiness.

1099
01:02:28,337 --> 01:02:29,170
- Yeah.

1100
01:02:30,273 --> 01:02:31,106
Well.

1101
01:02:31,972 --> 01:02:32,805
Find it in yourself before you look

1102
01:02:32,805 --> 01:02:34,267
for it in someone else, kiddo.

1103
01:02:40,494 --> 01:02:42,827
- Will you hold me a second?

1104
01:02:44,172 --> 01:02:45,005
- Yeah.

1105
01:02:51,949 --> 01:02:52,782
- Oh.

1106
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,420
Where are the men like you?

1107
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:01,162
- You don't want anybody
like me, believe me.

1108
01:03:01,162 --> 01:03:02,512
- I don't know what I want.

1109
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:07,087
I know what I don't want.

1110
01:03:08,437 --> 01:03:10,223
And for that I'm like a magnet.

1111
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:14,750
- Just forget it.

1112
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:17,480
Forget about all of it.

1113
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,313
Just

1114
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:20,413
just swing.

1115
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:33,860
(crickets chirp)

1116
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,900
- Alright, everybody, let's go, come on.

1117
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:44,090
We have reservations.

1118
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:46,300
- Do we have to go to La Contesse?

1119
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:47,630
It's one of Tony's hangs.

1120
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,160
- It's John's favorite restaurant,

1121
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:50,355
he's paying for this evening.

1122
01:03:50,355 --> 01:03:51,620
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

1123
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:52,453
- That's right, he's getting

1124
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,359
the Becker clan in one big dose,

1125
01:03:54,359 --> 01:03:55,820
it's gonna be hard enough on the poor guy.

1126
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,968
- Mom, do I have to wear a tie?

1127
01:03:57,968 --> 01:04:01,477
- Oh, Andy, honey, yes,
wear it for me, for me.

1128
01:04:01,477 --> 01:04:05,050
- [Andrew] Only because it's
your last night as a Becker.

1129
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:06,893
- Once a Becker, always a Becker.

1130
01:04:09,901 --> 01:04:10,860
- Mary.

1131
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:11,960
- What, well, Hell,

1132
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,246
if nuns are gonna start
dressing like that,

1133
01:04:14,246 --> 01:04:16,868
I'm going back to church.

1134
01:04:16,868 --> 01:04:18,570
- Let's go, let's go, come on, come on.

1135
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:21,470
Put that on in the car, let's go!

1136
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:22,303
- Don't!

1137
01:04:34,887 --> 01:04:36,778
- [Carhop] Evening.

1138
01:04:36,778 --> 01:04:38,445
- Hi.
- [Carhop] Hi.

1139
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,180
- Yeah, thanks.

1140
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:43,173
Listen, uh, keep it near the exit.

1141
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,160
- You always drive like a lunatic?

1142
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,510
- Only when I want to drink.

1143
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:55,690
- Oh, no, by the way, no
drinking, not tonight.

1144
01:04:55,690 --> 01:04:56,830
- Get serious, Mother.

1145
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:57,663
- Anne, don't.

1146
01:04:57,663 --> 01:04:59,610
- I am very serious.

1147
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:01,050
I don't want any of you giving John

1148
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:02,590
a hard time tonight, especially you, Anne.

1149
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:03,980
- We'll be fine, Mom.

1150
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:05,880
- Okay, I hope so, I'm counting on it.

1151
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,600
Alright, let's go, we're late.

1152
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,660
John's in there waiting.

1153
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:09,730
- Probably slept here last night

1154
01:05:09,730 --> 01:05:11,200
to make sure we got a good table.

1155
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,680
- Okay, okay, okay, that's it,
that's it. Now listen to me.

1156
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:17,230
We're leaving that sense of
humor out of here, alright?

1157
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:18,780
We're gonna go in their
tonight like a family

1158
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:20,411
that is happy, that its mother is marrying

1159
01:05:20,411 --> 01:05:22,810
this man tomorrow, alright?

1160
01:05:22,810 --> 01:05:25,593
No comments, no comments,
no discussions, no jokes.

1161
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:27,763
We're gonna go in there,

1162
01:05:27,763 --> 01:05:28,940
we're gonna have a good evening,

1163
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:32,603
polite, cheerful conversation,
great food, no liquor.

1164
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:35,780
Alright, I want you, I want you

1165
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:38,500
all put on your nice happy face.

1166
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:39,890
And we're gonna have...

1167
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:41,323
Smile, dammit!

1168
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:43,700
Good, okay.

1169
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,143
Now, have fun.

1170
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,453
- This'll never last.

1171
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,430
- So I took 'em on a little
fishing trip to the Ozarks.

1172
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:56,500
- [Dennis] You have a place there?

1173
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:58,610
- I have a small cabin on the lake.

1174
01:05:58,610 --> 01:06:01,009
I believe in a good mix
of business and pleasure.

1175
01:06:01,009 --> 01:06:02,240
- Oh, you have to enjoy it or why do it?

1176
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,440
- Well, I figure if you're gonna work

1177
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,620
with somebody that long, it
might as well be my friend.

1178
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:06,660
- I agree.

1179
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:09,240
- Especially if they're
women, right, Denny?

1180
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:12,470
- Anne, why don't you eat and let us talk?

1181
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:15,020
- You sound like one of my husbands.

1182
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:15,903
Maybe both.

1183
01:06:17,352 --> 01:06:18,185
- So, uh, Mary,

1184
01:06:18,185 --> 01:06:21,010
how did you end up in
a mission in Arizona?

1185
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,120
- Oh, I asked for the assignment.

1186
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:23,953
- It must be rewarding.

1187
01:06:23,953 --> 01:06:26,793
- It was, is. It is.

1188
01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:28,990
Are you gonna finish that?

1189
01:06:31,152 --> 01:06:31,985
- We could just get a bucket

1190
01:06:31,985 --> 01:06:33,510
and strap it to your face, Mary.

1191
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:36,813
- [Anne] So Mom, where are you two

1192
01:06:36,813 --> 01:06:39,000
gonna be living after tomorrow?

1193
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,163
- Oh, at the house.

1194
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:44,800
There's more privacy there
than in John's condo.

1195
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,010
- Nana, can we have our ice cream?

1196
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:48,910
- You eat the rest of your food first.

1197
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,850
Don't give me that look, girl.

1198
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:55,355
- I'm buying dinner, she can
have ice cream if she wants.

1199
01:06:55,355 --> 01:06:56,555
- I don't care who pays.

1200
01:06:57,912 --> 01:06:59,462
Sorry, Mom, you know the rules.

1201
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:01,960
- Well, I think a little discipline

1202
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,610
at this table should be welcomed.

1203
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:06,870
- I think you may be right, Anne.

1204
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:10,490
- Or maybe everyone just needs
a little drink to loosen up.

1205
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:11,860
Margaritaville, Andy?

1206
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:12,693
- Eat!

1207
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:16,750
- Sorry about all this.

1208
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:18,840
- Well, there's nothing to be sorry about.

1209
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,120
Dinner with my family,
we all had to be silent.

1210
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,120
This is kind of fun.

1211
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,330
- Come on, John, tell
us how you really feel.

1212
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:28,830
- You know, we could show
him how it used to be, Anne.

1213
01:07:28,830 --> 01:07:30,880
I could turn you over my knee.

1214
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,197
- I'm just giving John a little insight

1215
01:07:32,197 --> 01:07:34,513
about the family he's marrying into.

1216
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,840
- Just the one he needs to hear it from.

1217
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,480
- Dad, I ate all my dinner.

1218
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,410
Can I have some dessert?

1219
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:43,110
- Finish that last bite of potato.

1220
01:07:44,085 --> 01:07:46,739
- I can't finish all of this!

1221
01:07:46,739 --> 01:07:48,540
- Then where are you
gonna put the ice cream?

1222
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:50,023
- I saved room for ice cream.

1223
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,490
- [Mary] I'll finish it.

1224
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:53,740
- No.

1225
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:56,480
Will everyone just please
let me deal with my own kids?

1226
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:58,020
- Andrew, you've gotten so domestic.

1227
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:58,853
- Butt out.

1228
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:00,943
Please.

1229
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:06,000
- I'm sorry, John, this is--

1230
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,970
- How it always is.

1231
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:09,120
So just get used to it.

1232
01:08:11,207 --> 01:08:12,830
- Anne.

1233
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:14,253
Let's dance.

1234
01:08:14,253 --> 01:08:17,253
(smooth jazz music)

1235
01:08:19,927 --> 01:08:21,640
- Dad, I can't eat all of this.

1236
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,190
You ordered me too much.

1237
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:25,410
- Alright young lady, private conference,

1238
01:08:25,410 --> 01:08:26,680
come on, right here.

1239
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,733
- I'll just finish this
so Andrew won't be so mad.

1240
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:45,027
- Why is she so afraid of letting him

1241
01:08:45,027 --> 01:08:46,327
see us like we really are?

1242
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:48,960
If she thinks it's gonna
be howdy-doody time

1243
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,490
whenever we get together, she's crazy.

1244
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:53,999
- She's nervous, would you
let her get through tomorrow?

1245
01:08:53,999 --> 01:08:55,240
Get that chip off your shoulder.

1246
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:57,730
- Hey, no lectures.

1247
01:08:57,730 --> 01:08:58,620
Okay, I'm glad you're back,

1248
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:00,107
but don't start playing big brother now.

1249
01:09:00,107 --> 01:09:01,660
- I'm not.

1250
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:03,851
But I am Mother's son, so I'm warning you.

1251
01:09:03,851 --> 01:09:04,684
- You're warning me?

1252
01:09:04,684 --> 01:09:06,160
- I'm warning you, watch what you say!

1253
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,740
- Kiss off!

1254
01:09:07,740 --> 01:09:09,300
We got into this by birth, not choice,

1255
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,150
so don't you start pushing me around.

1256
01:09:15,533 --> 01:09:19,500
Mom, I'm going to the bar
and I am having one drink.

1257
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:22,330
Now I am too old to chastise or spank.

1258
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:23,803
I said I wouldn't drink in front of you

1259
01:09:23,803 --> 01:09:26,213
and I won't but I am having a drink.

1260
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:28,190
Thanks for dinner.

1261
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:29,133
- You're a real piece of work, Anne.

1262
01:09:29,133 --> 01:09:31,640
- Just save it for
somebody who cares, Denny.

1263
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,640
- Mom, let her have one drink.

1264
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,180
- We are the only people in the world

1265
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:37,530
who would put up with her crap.

1266
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:39,390
- Dennis, we have little ones present.

1267
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:42,080
- And Mom, they've heard it before.

1268
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,913
- Dad says the F word.

1269
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:46,120
- Jersey, would you just--

1270
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:48,560
Alright, who ate all her food?

1271
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,317
- Mom, everything's going to be fine.

1272
01:09:55,426 --> 01:09:57,621
- [Anne] What did you call me?!

1273
01:09:57,621 --> 01:09:58,521
- Know that voice.

1274
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:02,363
- [Restaurant Goer] Waiter?
- [Waiter] I don't know.

1275
01:10:04,465 --> 01:10:06,750
- Hey, you're lucky it isn't gasoline.

1276
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:08,606
Tony, let go of me!

1277
01:10:08,606 --> 01:10:09,439
Tony!

1278
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:10,272
- Tony?

1279
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:11,272
- That's it.

1280
01:10:14,147 --> 01:10:15,763
- Hi, you must be Tony.

1281
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:17,773
- Yeah.

1282
01:10:17,773 --> 01:10:20,650
- Hi, I'm Andrew, I'm
Anne's elder brother.

1283
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:21,810
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

1284
01:10:21,810 --> 01:10:23,920
You know, we've never met
before, but I gotta tell you,

1285
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:25,930
it's nice to meet a man

1286
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,930
who knows how to put her in her
place, you know what I mean?

1287
01:10:32,530 --> 01:10:35,113
(bluesy music)

1288
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:40,165
You ever touch my sister
again, I'll kill you.

1289
01:10:40,165 --> 01:10:42,832
- Andrew, that's him behind you!

1290
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:06,048
- Yeah, hold this.

1291
01:11:08,073 --> 01:11:09,406
- That's enough!

1292
01:11:10,737 --> 01:11:11,783
You break it up!

1293
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:14,443
You too, pal, stop!

1294
01:11:38,476 --> 01:11:41,059
- [Jersey] Daddy!
- Wait, honey!

1295
01:11:45,115 --> 01:11:47,615
(man screams)

1296
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:56,757
- Get back here.

1297
01:11:56,757 --> 01:11:58,852
You'll get yourselves killed!

1298
01:11:58,852 --> 01:12:01,019
Get back here and be safe!

1299
01:12:11,212 --> 01:12:12,795
- Denny, watch out!

1300
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:21,463
- Don't touch her, she's pregnant!

1301
01:12:32,827 --> 01:12:34,318
- Stay!

1302
01:12:34,318 --> 01:12:35,151
Mary!

1303
01:12:41,833 --> 01:12:43,655
Hey, are you deaf?

1304
01:12:43,655 --> 01:12:44,905
She's pregnant!

1305
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:49,129
(applause)

1306
01:12:49,129 --> 01:12:51,379
- [Amy] Way to go, Grandma!

1307
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:58,353
- Honey, why didn't--

1308
01:12:58,353 --> 01:12:59,261
- [Policeman] Okay, that's enough.

1309
01:12:59,261 --> 01:13:00,094
- [Policewoman] Let's go.

1310
01:13:00,094 --> 01:13:00,927
- [Policeman] Put your hands on the bar.

1311
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:03,260
Get over there, move!

1312
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:04,410
Hands behind your back.

1313
01:13:05,901 --> 01:13:08,151
- This guy's over here,
breaking four tables.

1314
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,393
- [Policeman] Settle down.

1315
01:13:10,393 --> 01:13:12,640
- You have the right to remain silent.

1316
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,363
- Where were you ten minutes ago?

1317
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:22,400
- Welcome to the family,

1318
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,263
you've passed the initiation.

1319
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,810
Got some bad news for you, though.

1320
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:27,643
- What, there are more children

1321
01:13:27,643 --> 01:13:29,030
in this family you haven't told me about?

1322
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:31,150
- No, they were drowned at birth.

1323
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:32,510
No, bad news is you're not gonna get

1324
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:34,090
a ring over that finger.

1325
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:35,767
- Yeah, that's great, isn't it?

1326
01:13:35,767 --> 01:13:37,910
- Bet Jersey got her ice cream.

1327
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:40,410
Cops always give those girls ice cream.

1328
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:41,740
- Your girls have been in jail before?

1329
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:45,031
- Oh, yeah, they've been
with me on some of, uh,

1330
01:13:45,031 --> 01:13:45,864
my bad nights.

1331
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,090
I hope the cops gave my girls ice cream.

1332
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,840
- I hope they gave Anne some.

1333
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:01,380
- Um, you got an extra?

1334
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:03,060
- Can't you afford your own?

1335
01:14:03,060 --> 01:14:04,590
- Yeah, I could, but they won't let me out

1336
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:06,590
so I can run down to the 7-Eleven.

1337
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:07,610
- Anne.

1338
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:09,910
Stop acting like Ida
Lupino and come sit down.

1339
01:14:12,570 --> 01:14:13,403
- Thanks.

1340
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:24,310
It does feel like the Late
Late Show in here, doesn't it?

1341
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:26,310
- Do you ever stop?

1342
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:30,490
- Well, some of us are all
talk, some of us are all action.

1343
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:35,003
Okay ladies, here's the plan.

1344
01:14:37,330 --> 01:14:39,060
Mary, you and me are gonna start a brawl,

1345
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:40,330
and when the guard comes to break it up,

1346
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:42,650
Mom, you jump him, grab his gun,

1347
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:44,893
blast out the menfolk, take to the road.

1348
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:47,253
We'll be the Becker gang.

1349
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:51,765
You'd be Ma Becker.

1350
01:14:51,765 --> 01:14:54,348
(Mary cackles)

1351
01:14:59,060 --> 01:15:00,310
You don't like that, huh.

1352
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,660
- I wonder what John's thinking.

1353
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,810
- Probably questioning
him under hot lights,

1354
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:08,173
beating him with a hose.

1355
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:16,170
Yeah, okay, I'm gonna go over there

1356
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:18,573
where the company's a
little bit less uptight.

1357
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:30,380
- You haven't said anything.

1358
01:15:34,578 --> 01:15:36,290
(Margret sighs)

1359
01:15:36,290 --> 01:15:37,513
- What am I gonna say?

1360
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,293
I'd always expected so much for you, Mary.

1361
01:15:45,870 --> 01:15:46,713
And from you.

1362
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,750
I feel like we let each other down.

1363
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:57,903
You not telling me, letting
me help you with this.

1364
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,020
- Mother, this had nothing to do with you.

1365
01:16:04,476 --> 01:16:05,309
It was just me.

1366
01:16:06,530 --> 01:16:09,260
- You weren't happy
with your calling, huh?

1367
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:10,653
- Yes, I was happy.

1368
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:14,553
But I want more.

1369
01:16:15,767 --> 01:16:18,607
(touching music)

1370
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:21,733
I mean, I just didn't go
into this with no thought.

1371
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,403
It didn't just happen.

1372
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,833
I want the baby.

1373
01:16:32,457 --> 01:16:34,207
- I know you're just following that

1374
01:16:36,010 --> 01:16:37,033
inner spirit.

1375
01:16:39,946 --> 01:16:41,570
(Margret sighs)

1376
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:42,913
There are other realities.

1377
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:47,800
- Mother, you're getting married tomorrow.

1378
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:54,083
How can you be so sure
you're doing the right thing?

1379
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:57,263
You can't.

1380
01:16:59,899 --> 01:17:00,870
And I can't either

1381
01:17:00,870 --> 01:17:04,143
and yes I'm scared and I have doubts.

1382
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:10,577
But we have to follow our hearts.

1383
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:24,320
I want a daughter.

1384
01:17:27,350 --> 01:17:28,700
So I can share with her

1385
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:31,490
all the things you've shared with me.

1386
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:38,323
- Me too, baby.

1387
01:17:39,686 --> 01:17:40,519
Me too.

1388
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:44,163
Oh, baby.

1389
01:17:46,043 --> 01:17:46,876
Me too.

1390
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:51,031
- Becker family.

1391
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,610
You're out of here.

1392
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,060
- I wanted to see what
they served for breakfast.

1393
01:18:01,060 --> 01:18:02,510
- We could leave you in here.

1394
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:07,184
- Yeah, no.

1395
01:18:07,184 --> 01:18:09,517
(Anne hums)

1396
01:18:12,838 --> 01:18:16,171
(dog barks in distance)

1397
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:30,960
- Are you alright?

1398
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:34,323
- I'm so sorry.

1399
01:18:35,914 --> 01:18:37,331
About everything.

1400
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,150
- Forget it.

1401
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:42,370
It's gonna be alright.

1402
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:45,691
- No, it's not.

1403
01:18:45,691 --> 01:18:48,524
(emotional music)

1404
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:14,073
I can't do it.

1405
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,393
- What?

1406
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,163
- Can't do it, John.

1407
01:19:23,620 --> 01:19:24,843
- What are you talking about?

1408
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:27,893
- I can't marry you.

1409
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:31,990
- We have friends coming in a few hours.

1410
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:33,570
It's been a hard night, you're just tired.

1411
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:35,293
- Mm-mm, it isn't that.

1412
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:38,903
You and I,

1413
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:41,640
oh, John, it won't work,

1414
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,583
my family has made that so clear.

1415
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:47,060
- Your family doesn't scare me.

1416
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:49,323
- John, they're just too different.

1417
01:19:50,210 --> 01:19:51,510
They all still need me.

1418
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:55,550
And I won't do it to you, it's not fair.

1419
01:19:55,550 --> 01:19:57,280
- I want you to be my wife.

1420
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,120
- John, you love me now,

1421
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,690
but Dennis is right, you know,

1422
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:07,514
in ten years, you'll be 49, I'll be 63.

1423
01:20:07,514 --> 01:20:09,070
And in 15 years--

1424
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:13,160
- In 15 years, we'll have
15 wonderful years together.

1425
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:13,993
- No!

1426
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:16,658
Because you're the one

1427
01:20:16,658 --> 01:20:18,323
that's gonna get hurt in the long run.

1428
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:23,180
I didn't want to admit
it because I love you.

1429
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,183
I do love you.

1430
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:31,400
I just can't marry you.

1431
01:20:33,566 --> 01:20:34,816
- Margret.
- No.

1432
01:20:36,407 --> 01:20:37,363
I'm sorry.

1433
01:20:51,907 --> 01:20:53,915
- No, that's not what it is!

1434
01:20:53,915 --> 01:20:54,867
- [Andrew] Yeah, we'll see
what you think in the morning.

1435
01:20:54,867 --> 01:20:55,817
- Hey, where's Mom?

1436
01:20:57,610 --> 01:20:59,270
- Upstairs.

1437
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:00,577
Just stop where you are.

1438
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:07,640
- Why don't you guys
get ready for bed, huh?

1439
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:17,840
- Margret has called off the wedding.

1440
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:24,910
I've never said anything

1441
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:26,860
about what you put your mother through.

1442
01:21:28,436 --> 01:21:30,336
Because I didn't feel it was my place.

1443
01:21:31,730 --> 01:21:33,963
But now you've turned my life upside down.

1444
01:21:36,610 --> 01:21:38,220
Now dammit, I want that woman to marry me

1445
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:40,470
and because of all of
you, she's doubting it.

1446
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,693
I'm not gonna let you come
in here and ruin this for us.

1447
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:50,650
You're not gonna take away what's become

1448
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:52,853
the most important thing in my life.

1449
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,680
- John, we're so sorry.

1450
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,216
- Look, just give us a
minute with her, okay?

1451
01:21:58,216 --> 01:22:01,216
(melancholic music)

1452
01:22:02,564 --> 01:22:03,564
- We got it.

1453
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,930
- If, um, you hear any screaming,

1454
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:11,753
it's just us trying to kick
some sense back into Mom.

1455
01:22:29,087 --> 01:22:32,324
(knocking on door)

1456
01:22:32,324 --> 01:22:33,157
- Mom.

1457
01:22:36,398 --> 01:22:39,860
Mom, we are really sorry for all of this.

1458
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:41,093
- Yeah, especially me.

1459
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:44,150
I know I'm a pain in the butt

1460
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:45,390
but don't blame yourself.

1461
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:47,120
My problems are my problems.

1462
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,030
- Same here.

1463
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:49,420
- And Mom, we're adults now.

1464
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:51,820
I know we may not act like
it all the time, but we are.

1465
01:22:51,820 --> 01:22:52,963
- Oh, I know that.

1466
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:55,113
This is my decision.

1467
01:22:56,230 --> 01:22:58,530
- Then why are you letting
us make it for you?

1468
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,230
- Because having all of
you kids back shows me

1469
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:04,173
that marrying John is wrong.

1470
01:23:05,490 --> 01:23:06,663
You still need me.

1471
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:11,780
- But Mom, you can't
take care of us forever.

1472
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,330
It's time to let go.

1473
01:23:13,330 --> 01:23:14,340
- When you have that baby,

1474
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:15,730
you're going to need me.

1475
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:18,410
- Mother, the baby's gonna
be my responsibility.

1476
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:20,400
I'm gonna have to raise it,

1477
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,550
and one day, I'm gonna
have to let go, too.

1478
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:25,584
- That's the key, Mom.

1479
01:23:25,584 --> 01:23:26,867
Let go.

1480
01:23:26,867 --> 01:23:28,763
And we're hopeless anyway.

1481
01:23:29,780 --> 01:23:32,670
- When Dad left, you held
this family together.

1482
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:36,573
You always made sure that we
had this house to come home to.

1483
01:23:37,644 --> 01:23:40,823
I don't know how you did it,
but we always came first.

1484
01:23:43,325 --> 01:23:44,930
- That was my choice.

1485
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:46,510
- And you did a great job.

1486
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:48,703
We had every opportunity we ever wanted.

1487
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,520
And now it's your turn.

1488
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,333
Why are you letting us stop you?

1489
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:59,640
- Well what do you want me to do?

1490
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:03,883
- Not ask that question.

1491
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:06,410
- You love John, don't you?

1492
01:24:09,312 --> 01:24:11,712
Then don't worry about
what anybody else thinks.

1493
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:15,000
We'll always be around for you.

1494
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,600
- Whether you want us to or not.

1495
01:24:18,210 --> 01:24:20,980
- John's a great guy and
he's downstairs right now,

1496
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:23,910
waiting for you, and because of us,

1497
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:25,770
I'm afraid that you're gonna let him go

1498
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:28,033
and I don't want to be
responsible for that.

1499
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:31,840
Although I wouldn't mind being responsible

1500
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,540
for getting you two back together.

1501
01:24:37,420 --> 01:24:39,070
I bought you a great wedding gift, Mom,

1502
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:40,593
I really don't want to return it.

1503
01:24:40,593 --> 01:24:42,643
- And I want to catch the bouquet.

1504
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:44,820
- Follow your heart, Ma.

1505
01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:47,897
I did, look where it got me.

1506
01:24:49,710 --> 01:24:51,350
- Marry him, Mom.

1507
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,243
Marry John.

1508
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:55,480
Have a great life.

1509
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:57,413
Show us it can be done.

1510
01:24:59,610 --> 01:25:00,620
- I love you, baby.

1511
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:02,250
- [Denny] Oh, I love you, Mom.

1512
01:25:08,810 --> 01:25:09,963
- I love you all.

1513
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:12,063
- Even me?

1514
01:25:13,478 --> 01:25:14,895
- Don't press it.

1515
01:26:09,658 --> 01:26:12,991
(all laugh and chatter)

1516
01:26:14,537 --> 01:26:17,870
(dog barks in distance)

1517
01:26:29,949 --> 01:26:32,920
- Aren't you gonna try
and sleep for a few hours?

1518
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,493
- No, I'd never wake up.

1519
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:46,934
- Smell the honeysuckle?

1520
01:26:46,934 --> 01:26:47,767
- Mm-hmm.

1521
01:26:49,030 --> 01:26:50,413
- Stars are all fading.

1522
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:57,623
Kind of makes you realize how
unimportant everything is.

1523
01:26:57,623 --> 01:27:01,023
- Nah, it's not unimportant,
it's just complicated.

1524
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:07,390
Are you gonna stay around here?

1525
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:08,340
- Yeah, I think so.

1526
01:27:09,630 --> 01:27:10,830
- What are you gonna do?

1527
01:27:12,011 --> 01:27:13,361
- Well, I have some skills.

1528
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,350
- Do you wanna share a place?

1529
01:27:20,905 --> 01:27:23,293
- I'm gonna have a baby.

1530
01:27:23,293 --> 01:27:24,903
- Well I can be the father.

1531
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:31,253
It doesn't look like I'm gonna
be a mother anytime soon.

1532
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:36,847
- I'd really like that.

1533
01:27:46,016 --> 01:27:47,461
- No wind this morning.

1534
01:27:47,461 --> 01:27:49,230
(wind chime dings)

1535
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:50,133
- You're here.

1536
01:27:53,650 --> 01:27:54,581
- Come here.

1537
01:27:54,581 --> 01:27:55,652
- No.

1538
01:27:55,652 --> 01:27:56,862
- No, come here, I just
wanna tell you something.

1539
01:27:56,862 --> 01:27:58,195
- [Anne] No, no!

1540
01:27:59,227 --> 01:28:01,950
- You are so flip, all the time.

1541
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:03,900
- I know, I'm castrating.

1542
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:04,733
Men love that.

1543
01:28:04,733 --> 01:28:07,130
- And you, keeping secrets?

1544
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:08,050
- What, I was gonna tell,

1545
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:10,800
it's just that big mouth
here blurted it out.

1546
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,670
- We decided to name the baby Jesus.

1547
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:15,761
Well, we figured with Mary as the mother

1548
01:28:15,761 --> 01:28:17,530
and no father in sight,

1549
01:28:17,530 --> 01:28:19,160
no, it'd be very historic!

1550
01:28:19,160 --> 01:28:20,860
- She's such a pain.

1551
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:22,885
- Why wasn't I invited to the party?

1552
01:28:22,885 --> 01:28:25,050
- [Dennis] Invitation's in the mail.

1553
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:26,350
Well, I've crashed before.

1554
01:28:33,300 --> 01:28:34,403
Don't mention it.

1555
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,790
- Did you get the kids to sleep?

1556
01:28:36,790 --> 01:28:38,400
- Yeah, they were pretty wound up.

1557
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:41,208
- Oh, they really sank
their teeth into Tony.

1558
01:28:41,208 --> 01:28:43,230
(all chuckle)

1559
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:45,360
I hope he scars.

1560
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:46,471
- Kids are great.

1561
01:28:46,471 --> 01:28:48,500
- Yeah, they'll always
come to your rescue.

1562
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:50,480
- Oh, and look how you all came to mine?

1563
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,710
- Did you think we were gonna
let that jerk manhandle you?

1564
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:56,263
- Yeah, nobody messes with this family.

1565
01:29:00,090 --> 01:29:02,260
- I never thought I would see us

1566
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:03,893
all sitting together like this.

1567
01:29:06,170 --> 01:29:08,550
- Well, we've all gone
in different directions.

1568
01:29:08,550 --> 01:29:10,980
- Yeah, we've been pulled there.

1569
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,660
But we're here now.

1570
01:29:12,660 --> 01:29:13,540
All that really matters is

1571
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:15,469
where you're at at the moment.

1572
01:29:15,469 --> 01:29:18,302
(emotional music)

1573
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:22,810
What?

1574
01:29:22,810 --> 01:29:23,643
- Yeah.

1575
01:29:24,917 --> 01:29:28,470
Now will you pull up a chair
so you can massage my feet?

1576
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:29,303
- Good idea.

1577
01:29:44,335 --> 01:29:48,002
(Margret moans in distance)

1578
01:29:54,575 --> 01:29:55,742
- Is that Mom?

1579
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,593
(all laugh)

1580
01:30:03,593 --> 01:30:04,729
- This is so juvenile.

1581
01:30:04,729 --> 01:30:06,173
- Oh, I can't handle this.

1582
01:30:06,173 --> 01:30:07,710
- This family needs major help,

1583
01:30:07,710 --> 01:30:09,246
you guys just left me there!

1584
01:30:09,246 --> 01:30:11,579
- Do you know what that was?

1585
01:30:14,089 --> 01:30:18,006
(wedding march plays on organ)

1586
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:27,870
- [Andrew] She's beautiful.

1587
01:31:27,870 --> 01:31:29,460
- [Anne] When do we tell
'em we're moving in?

1588
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:31,390
- After the papers are signed.

1589
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:33,630
- No, let's not tell her,
let's just surprise her.

1590
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:34,660
- Okay.

1591
01:31:34,660 --> 01:31:36,440
- You're not coming within miles of us.

1592
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,850
- Could we have some reverence, please?

1593
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:40,690
- You're talking to the
wrong family, Padre.

1594
