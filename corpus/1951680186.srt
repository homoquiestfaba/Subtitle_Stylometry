1
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,069
Ibaptisethee, Catherine,

2
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,680
in the name ofthe Father,
and the Son...

3
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,676
-..and the Holy Ghost...

4
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,111
No-one who had ever seen
Catherine Morland in her infancy

5
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,913
would have supposed her
born to be a heroine.

6
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,076
Her situation in life,

7
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,076
the character of her
father and mother,

8
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,554
and her own person
and disposition,

9
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,352
were all equally against her.

10
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,075
A family of ten children,
of course,

11
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,634
will always be called
a fine family,

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,513
where there are heads and arms
and legs enough for the number.

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,597
But the Morlands were,
in general, very plain,

14
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,315
and Catherine, for many years
of her life,as plain as any.

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,390
Neither was it very wonderful

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,989
that Catherine, who had, by nature,
nothing heroic about her,

17
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,998
should prefer cricket and
baseball to dolls and books.

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,794
But by the age of 1 5,
appearances were mending.

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,400
Catherine Morland was
in training for a heroine.

20
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,429
Yes!.

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,959
Whoo!. Whoo!.

22
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,319
You know,our Catherine has
turned out rather well.

23
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,398
-Come on, Catherine,let's carry on.
-No, later. Later.

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,590
She's quite a good-looking girl.

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,234
Well, she is almost pretty today.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,719
And she has grown
very fond of reading of late.

27
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,072
I wonder if it can be good for her,
my dear,to read quite so many novels?.

28
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,394
Why ever not?.

29
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,877
What could be a more innocent or harmless
pastime for a young girl than reading?.

30
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,759
"He was interrupted by a noise in the
passage leading to the room.

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,476
It approached. The door was unlocked. A man
entered, dragging behind him a beautiful girl,

32
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,512
her features bathed in tears
and suffering the utmost distress. "

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,791
Take her!. Convey her where
I shall never see her more!.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,391
Cathy!.

35
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,919
What are you doing?.

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,109
Nothing.

37
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,310
What do you want, anyway?.

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,036
Mr and Mrs Allen are here.Mother says
you have to come straight away.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,949
No, said Dr Malleson, no other place will do
so well for a gouty constitution like Mr Allen's.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,638
No other place will do so well for...

41
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,829
Ooh!

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,632
..for squandering money.

43
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,352
Oh, fie, Mr Allen!

44
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,311
You know you love
to see me happy.

45
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,955
-And thinking of that...
-Catherine is young to go.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,959
But with Mr and Mrs Allen for
protection,I see no danger in it.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,514
She's a good girl.
I think we can trust her.

48
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,239
Why, Catherine,
how you've grown!

49
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,873
Quite the young lady,
isn't she, Mr Allen?.

50
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,151
Mr and Mrs Allen come with
an invitation, Catherine.

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,351
We would like you to accompany
us to Bath for a time.

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,868
For when a young lady
is to be a heroine,

53
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,959
something must and will happen
to throw adventure in her way.

54
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,992
"A tumult of emotions stirred in the
bosom of Adeline. Fear gripped her heart,

55
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,952
that, at any moment,
ruffians would fly upon the carriage

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,958
and return her to the ignominy
of her captive state. "

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,877
Ya!

58
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,549
Whoa!

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,072
My God, Mrs Allen!

60
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,119
Ohh!

61
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,596
Argh!

62
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,556
Aaaargh!

63
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,433
Whoa! Steady there!

64
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,880
- Come on!
- Not long now.

65
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,148
Come on!

66
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,471
Pulteney Street is not quite
the smartest address,

67
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,159
but, for myself,
I love to be at the centre of things.

68
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,394
So do l!

69
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,115
There's a little peach
that's ripe for plucking.

70
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,558
So many people!

71
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,990
I wonder who they can be,
and what their stories are.

72
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,669
Hardly worth knowing, I should say,
if they choose to roam the streets

73
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,678
when they could be sitting at home
by a good fire.

74
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,188
Oh! Mr Allen is so droll.

75
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,074
He always says the opposite of what
he means,for he loves good company.

76
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,429
When shall we go
into society, Mrs Allen?.

77
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,516
I suppose it is too
late this evening?.

78
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,677
Bless you, my child,we neither
of us have a stitch to wear.

79
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,109
I did bring my best frock,and my
pink muslin is not too bad, I think.

80
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,275
No, no, no!

81
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,788
Would you have us
laughed out of Bath?.

82
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,751
Resign yourself, Catherine.

83
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,156
Shops must be visited.
Money must be spent.

84
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,475
Do you think you
could bear it?.

85
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,039
Very easily, sir.

86
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,150
- That's it.
- My lady.

87
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,593
And more.

88
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,476
That's the last, madam.

89
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,709
There.

90
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,433
MRS ALLEN: Did you ever
see anything prettier,Mr Allen?.

91
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,517
Other than yourself,
do you mean, my dear?.

92
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,278
Oh, fie, Mr Allen!

93
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,915
-But Catherine...
-Ah, she looks just as she should.

94
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,838
Now...might we make our way,
do you think?.

95
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,113
I entertain high hopes of our
arriving at the rooms by midnight.

96
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,791
How he teases us, Catherine.

97
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,831
Midnight, indeed!

98
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,995
Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Whoa, there!

99
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,630
- Stay.
- Good evening, sir.

100
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,636
This way. Mind how you go now, sir.

101
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,398
This way, ladies.

102
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,231
Heidi! Good to see you!

103
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,395
Sedley!

104
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,469
Sedley! There you are!
Is there anyone here?.

105
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,988
Not a soul, John!
There's no-one here at all!

106
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,632
What could he mean?.

107
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,117
If I might just... Thank you.

108
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,029
Excuse me.

109
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,832
Card room, I think.

110
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,235
- Mr Allen!
- See you later, my love.

111
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,992
Come this way, Catherine.

112
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,029
Oh!

113
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,672
Pardon me, miss.

114
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,872
Excuse me.

115
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,350
Perhaps we should go
through to the tea room.

116
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,515
Mmm.

117
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,476
Quick - there are two places!

118
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,833
How uncomfortable it is
not to know anybody.

119
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,917
Yes, my dear,
very uncomfortable indeed.

120
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,919
But then, you see, one can't speak to
people unless one has been introduced.

121
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,117
- But who will introduce us?.
- I'm sure I've no idea.

122
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,630
I don't know. Mother
and daughter, I'd guess.

123
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,830
Had we not better go away?.

124
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,872
There are no tea things for us,
and I think we are unwelcome here.

125
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,911
Yes, it's most disagreeable.

126
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,508
I wish we had
a large acquaintance here.

127
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,559
I wish we had any.

128
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,513
Mrs Allen.

129
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,471
-Ooh! Have a care, sir!
-A thousand apologies, ma'am.

130
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,830
Catherine, do take this pin out of my
sleeve.It was not your fault,sir.

131
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,598
Allow me, ma'am.

132
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,993
Thank you kindly, sir.

133
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,315
Though I'm afraid it's
torn a hole already.

134
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,272
There. Nothing too
disastrous, ma'am.

135
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,312
I shall be sorry if it has,
for it's a favourite gown.

136
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,512
-Really, Mrs Allen, one would hardly notice.
-Though it cost but nine shillings a yard.

137
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,919
Nine shillings?.

138
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,794
-That is exactly what I should have guessed.
-Do you understand muslins, sir?.

139
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,510
I understand them very well.

140
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,996
My sister has often entrusted me
in the choice of a gown.

141
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,474
I bought one for her only the other day.

142
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,752
Five shillings a yard, and a true lndian
muslin. What do you make of that?.

143
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,279
Well!

144
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,032
And I can never get Mr Allen
to tell one of my gowns from another.

145
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,076
But tell me, sir, what do you think
of Miss Morland's gown?.

146
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,951
Miss Morland's gown...

147
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,593
Miss Morland's gown
is very pretty.

148
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,631
Though I don't think
it will wash well.

149
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,591
I am afraid it will fray.

150
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,278
How can you be so...?.

151
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,676
Presumptuous?. Indeed.
Without so much as an introduction.

152
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,314
You must allow me to make amends, Mrs Allen.

153
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,312
Gentlemen.

154
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,355
- Thank you.
- Very kind indeed.

155
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,719
One moment.

156
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,956
What a very...

157
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,429
Really, I shouldn't have allowed you
to speak to him, as a stranger.

158
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,358
But he had such an
understanding of muslin.

159
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,311
I wonder where he's gone.

160
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,597
Here he comes again. And he
has brought Mr King with him.

161
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,756
The Master of Ceremonies himself!

162
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,076
Mrs Allen.

163
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,076
Miss Morland.

164
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,908
Allow me to present
to you Mr Henry T:ilney,

165
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,951
just lately arrived in Bath.

166
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,275
Mrs Allen, Miss Morland.

167
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,470
Delighted to make
your acquaintance.

168
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,796
Mr King.

169
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,356
Now we may talk to one another.

170
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,436
But we've already been talking.

171
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,914
You mustn't allow anyone
to hear you say such things,

172
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,157
or we shall all be expelled
from polite society.

173
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,316
Let it be our secret.

174
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,114
And now, if your card is not
already full,Miss Morland,

175
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,674
might I request the pleasure
of the next dance with you?.

176
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,868
With me?.

177
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,912
Thank you.

178
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,117
Forgive me, I have been very remiss
in the proper attentions of a partner.

179
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,553
What are they?.

180
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,591
Oh, I ask you how long
you have been in Bath,

181
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,234
have you been to the theatre,
and the concert, and so on.

182
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,951
Wouldn't that be rather dull?.

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,194
Of course.

184
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,110
But we must do our duty.
Are you ready?.

185
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,229
Yes.

186
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,271
How long have you been
in Bath, madam?.

187
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,151
Not long at all, sir.

188
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,270
- And were you never here before?.
- Never, sir.

189
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,880
Indeed! And have
you been to the play?.

190
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,478
Not yet, sir.

191
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,114
Astonishing. The concert?.

192
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,832
No.

193
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,235
Amazing. Now tell me...

194
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,669
Are you altogether
pleased with Bath, madam?.

195
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,233
Yes.

196
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,759
I like it very well.

197
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,028
Excellent.

198
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,475
Now I must give you one smirk,
and then we can be rational again.

199
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,876
Do you know that gentleman?.

200
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,148
Not at all.

201
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,791
I wonder why he
keeps looking at us.

202
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,592
I imagine he likes what he sees.

203
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,789
What?.

204
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,558
Do you mean me?.

205
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,919
Why not?.

206
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,037
So, tell me,what will you write
in your journal tonight?.

207
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,071
"Friday, went to the Lower Rooms,

208
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,918
wore my sprigged muslin dress
with blue trimmings,

209
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,713
and looked very pretty,
though I say so myself."

210
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,275
-The next dance! Lord Byron's...
-"Danced with one man,

211
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,357
was stared at by another
much more handsome."

212
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,994
Indeed I shall say no such thing.

213
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,268
Then what shall you say?.

214
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,996
Perhaps I don't keep
a journal at all.

215
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,593
Come on!

216
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,313
A most agreeable young man.
Was he not, Catherine?.

217
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,634
Yes.

218
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,240
He was very kind,
and very amusing.

219
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,111
I liked him very much.

220
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,912
Well, Mr Allen?.

221
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,439
No, l...

222
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,471
I didn't mean anything like that.

223
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,159
He can't have thought of me like that,
he is much too...

224
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,792
He is quite grown-up.

225
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,435
Catherine, I feel
I should warn you

226
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,631
that Bath attracts all manner
of scoundrels and adventurers,

227
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,797
and one cannot be too careful
when making new acquaintances.

228
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,149
Mr T:ilney, a scoundrel?.

229
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,871
Mr Tilney, an adventurer?.

230
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,553
He understands muslin, Mr Allen.

231
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,959
He has a sister.

232
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,878
Well, upon inquiries,

233
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,596
I did discover that Mr Tilney is a young man
of very good family, and a clergyman to boot.

234
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,753
A clergyman?.

235
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,155
No doubt you'd prefer
him to be a brigand?.

236
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,509
His father's a man of
consequence, though.

237
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,357
General Tilney,

238
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,038
of Northanger Abbey.

239
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,877
Northanger Abbey?.

240
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,519
Is it haunted?.

241
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,357
No doubt, no doubt.

242
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,358
These abbeys usually are.

243
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,079
Whoa!

244
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,157
..wearing the same old things
that one wouldn't have thought of.

245
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,908
Mrs Allen?.

246
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,111
And this must be Miss Morland.

247
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,471
Mrs Thorpe. Your brother James
told me to look out for you.

248
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,229
-You know James?.
-lndeed. He is up at Oxford with my son, John.

249
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,714
Mrs Thorpe!
My old schoolfellow!

250
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,478
Yes, he went to you at Christmas.

251
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,353
And I may say he endeared
himself to us all.

252
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,960
Ah, here come my girls now.

253
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,072
Isabella, my eldest,
and Maria and Anne.

254
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,636
Isabella, this is Mrs Allen,
and Miss Catherine Morland.

255
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,557
James's sister.

256
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,113
James's sister!

257
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,718
How do you do, Miss Morland?.

258
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,432
I have so long
wished to meet you.

259
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,472
Your brother has spoken of you
so affectionately.

260
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,115
I am sure that we will be
the very best of friends.

261
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,237
I am so pleased you love
Mrs Radcliffe's novels, too.

262
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,319
I wish I were you, just beginning
to read Udolpho for the first time.

263
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,793
Is it really very horrid?.

264
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,115
You can't even imagine.

265
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,037
But I wouldn't tell
you for the world.

266
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,594
Well, perhaps one incident
to whet your appetite.

267
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,792
Can such things really happen?.

268
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,478
Well, just think of Lord Byron.

269
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,351
I have heard that he is very wicked.

270
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,312
But I don't know exactly
what he is supposed to have done.

271
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,189
Oh!

272
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,197
And I have heard that
he is here, in Bath.

273
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,913
Shall we go to the Pump Room
and see if we can see him?.

274
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,235
Perhaps your Mr Tilney
will be there, too.

275
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,589
He's not my Mr Tilney, lsabella.

276
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,949
Indeed, you mustn't say he is!

277
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,638
Isn't he?.

278
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,719
Well, there's a certain person
who will be very glad to hear that.

279
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,959
Who do you mean?.

280
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,752
Never you mind.

281
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,118
Oh.

282
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,312
I do so hate it when strangers listen
to one's private conversations.

283
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,192
No, his name's not there.

284
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,916
I think he must be gone from Bath.

285
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,560
And yet he never mentioned
his stay would be so short.

286
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,112
Perhaps it's just as well.

287
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,197
My brother John says
the whole family is very bad.

288
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,471
The eldest son as bad
as Lord Byron,John says.

289
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,799
Surely he's mistaken. Mr Tilney couldn't
have been kinder or more gentleman-like.

290
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,751
Appearances often
deceive, you know.

291
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,438
But he is a clergyman.

292
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,074
That signifies nothing these days.

293
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,471
Insufferable!

294
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,791
Come, let's walk outside.

295
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,431
Nice. Both girls.

296
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,469
Nosegays! Buttonholes!

297
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,875
Posies! Buttonholes!

298
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,478
Are they following?.

299
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,749
No, they are going
towards the churchyard.

300
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,272
Good. We are rid of them.

301
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,357
Now, if we turn down there,
it will bring us to Milsom Street.

302
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,233
But shouldn't we come upon
them again if we did that?.

303
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,554
Oh, never mind that.

304
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,477
Come, make haste.

305
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,158
Posies!

306
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:56,150
Oh, these odious carriages!
How I detest them!

307
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,633
Make way! Make way!

308
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,831
- lsabella!
- Oh, how delightful!

309
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,632
Mr Morland and my brother John!

310
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,949
James!

311
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,036
I didn't know you were coming to Bath.

312
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,433
Thorpe's idea.

313
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,871
When I remembered you were here, and you,
Miss Thorpe, nothing would have kept me away.

314
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,990
I am very happy to see you again.

315
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,519
And l, you.

316
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,312
- Miss Morland.
- My good friend John Thorpe.

317
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,793
Enchanté.

318
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,991
I had the pleasure
of seeing you dance the other evening.

319
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,031
Yes, I remember.

320
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,516
I hope I may have the pleasure
of dancing with you myself before too long.

321
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,396
- We were walking towards Edgar's Buildings.
- Were you?.

322
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,590
Damn it, we'll walk with you! Miss Morland?.

323
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,637
- Are you fond of an open carriage?.
- Oh, yes, very.

324
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,832
Well, would you permit me to drive you
up Lansdown Hill one day this week?.

325
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,599
Thank you. You are very kind.

326
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,476
But...would it be proper?.

327
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,472
Oh, damn it, this is Bath.

328
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,034
You know?. Everything's more
free and easy in Bath.

329
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,797
Penny for your thoughts,
Miss Morland?.

330
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,230
I was just...Have you ever
read Udolpho, Mr Thorpe?.

331
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,111
Udolpho?. Lord!

332
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,674
No, I never read novels.
I leave all that to lsabella.

333
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,949
-I read The Monk the other day, though.
-The Monk!

334
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,355
Is it as shocking
as everybody says?.

335
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,072
You can borrow it,
if you care to.

336
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,111
Hot stuff, you know.

337
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,794
-lsn't this altogether delightful,Catherine?.
-Yes!

338
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,717
What say?. Jig it again?.

339
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,593
Take your partners
for the next dance!

340
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,798
A Prodigal Fellow!

341
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,033
Miss Morland.

342
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,230
Allow me to introduce...

343
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,679
Eleanor.

344
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,153
My sister.

345
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,233
Your sister!

346
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,309
Oh...

347
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,158
Yes, I am very happy to
meet you, Miss Tilney.

348
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,679
And l, you.

349
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,835
Henry has told me so much about you.

350
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,951
You can't imagine how surprised I
was to see your brother again.

351
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,514
I felt so sure of his being
quite gone from Bath.

352
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,429
Yes, when he saw you, he was here to engage
lodgings for us. He only stayed the one night.

353
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,198
Oh, I see.

354
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,389
He, your brother, dances very well.

355
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,829
- Yes.
- And he is very amusing.

356
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,314
Yes, he is, when he cares to be.

357
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,389
Do you know that gentleman
talking to Mr Tilney?.

358
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,279
That's our father,

359
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,799
General Tilney.

360
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,599
He looks as if he were
displeased with us.

361
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,518
It is only his way.

362
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,754
And is your mother here with you
in Bath as well?.

363
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,912
Our mother is dead.

364
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,838
So this is your first time in Bath?.

365
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,438
Do you like it?.

366
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,311
Very much indeed.

367
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,590
There are some very pretty
walks round about.

368
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,517
Henry and I walk most mornings.

369
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,312
Should you care to join us one day?.

370
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,998
Yes.

371
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,838
More than anything in the world.
I love long walks.

372
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,910
Though I can't persuade
my friend to join me.

373
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,430
She thinks it a waste of time when there are
so many other things to do in town.

374
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,833
I can see that she might.

375
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,997
She says the most appalling things.

376
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,999
In that case, shall we say
tomorrow at 12, unless it rains?.

377
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,314
Yes.

378
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,749
Catherine. You simply must hear this.

379
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,313
Come, quickly!

380
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,759
Excuse me.

381
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,358
Of course.

382
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,589
Make haste, Miss Morland!Put on
your hat, there's no time to lose!

383
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,631
-We are going to Blaize Castle!
-Mr Thorpe!

384
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,399
-How do you do, Mrs Allen?.
My sweetest Catherine.

385
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,353
Isn't this delightful?.Blaize Castle,
nothing could be more romantic.

386
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,790
Yes, I'm sure, but I am very sorry,
I can't come with you.

387
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,549
I am expecting Miss Tilney and her brother
to call on me to take a country walk.

388
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:56,072
Not they! I saw them five minutes ago.Doesn't
he drive a phaeton with a pair of chestnuts?.

389
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,712
I don't know, indeed.

390
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,753
I saw him large as life, on the Lansdown Road,
with a smart-looking girl by his side.

391
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,360
But perhaps they mean to call later.

392
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,799
No, they don't.

393
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,037
I heard T:ilney hallooing to a man
they were going as far as Wick Rocks.

394
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,230
I don't understand it at all.

395
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,350
Miss T:ilney promised.

396
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,757
In this false world, people often make promises
they have little intention of keeping.

397
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,553
Remember, we are
your true friends.

398
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,516
- We keep our promises.
- Yes.

399
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,516
But what if they should
come after all?.

400
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,917
My dear scatter-brained sister, haven't you just
heard him say they're halfway to Wick Rocks?.

401
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,753
Then...

402
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,358
perhaps I should come with you.

403
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,118
Please, Miss Morland.

404
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,196
Goes very nice, doesn't she?.
Smooth as silk!

405
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,435
How do you do, sir?.

406
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,357
Scoundrel!

407
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,510
Pleasant old gentleman.

408
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,714
Mr Allen?. Yes, and so good natured.

409
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,470
- And rich as Croesus, or so I hear.
- I believe Mr Allen is very rich.

410
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,351
- And no children at all?.
- No, none.

411
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:11,791
-But you're quite a favourite, though, I gather?.
-Mr and Mrs Allen are very kind to me, yes.

412
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,070
- Ever since I was a baby.
- Excellent. Excellent!

413
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,439
Oh, Miss Tilney!

414
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,710
Stop! Stop now!
It's Miss Tilney and her brother!

415
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,150
-There'll be hell to pay if I tried to stop him now!
-Please stop, Mr Thorpe!

416
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,430
- I'll get down! I will!
- It's not possible!

417
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,833
Oh!

418
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,677
Whoa, there!

419
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,392
How could you deceive me so?.

420
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,433
Well, what if I did?. Where would you rather be?.
In a spanking gig driving to Blaize Castle

421
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,438
or trailing about in the dirt
with some canting prig of a parson?.

422
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,835
Mr T:ilney is not a canting prig!

423
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,440
You have made it seem
as if I had broken my promise to them.

424
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,152
Whoa, there.

425
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,599
Look here!

426
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,232
Miss Morland...

427
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,112
I might not have been completely straight
with you, but I had good reason.

428
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,879
You think of your brother's happiness,
and lsabella's.

429
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,592
They couldn't go off unchaperoned.

430
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,710
And I was thinking of you, too.

431
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,638
I'm not altogether happy
to see you with the T:ilneys.

432
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,750
The whole family has a terrible reputation.

433
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,439
Something very strange
about the mother's death.

434
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,959
But you can't mean...?.

435
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,278
We must be careful making new acquaintances.
We're not all as honest as you and l, eh?.

436
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,153
But Mr Tilney and his sister
have been so kind to me.

437
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,433
Truly sorry, Miss Morland,
if I have caused you any distress.

438
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,392
But you can set it
all right tomorrow.

439
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,034
Let's at least try and
enjoy ourselves today.

440
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,392
Damn it, I've been looking forward to driving you
out more than anything. What do you say?.

441
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,671
- Very well.
- Whoa!

442
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,070
- Everything all right, Thorpe?.
- Absolutely.

443
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,314
Walk on.

444
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,630
- Go on!
- Walk on.

445
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,754
-I say, sir,can you move your sheep, please?.
-Oh, go on!

446
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,119
Hi, hi, hi!

447
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,958
It's just a spot of rain,
it will clear up in no time.

448
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,391
We'd better go back. Your sister thinks so,too.
We're not halfway to Blaize Castle.

449
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,476
Very well, as you wish!

450
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,112
It's all one to me!

451
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,312
If your brother hadn't such a damned beast to
drive, we'd have been there this half hour gone.

452
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,749
Will you move your sheep?. I need to turn.

453
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,677
I'll take my bloody time!

454
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,551
Come on, girl!

455
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,390
Lord! What would the men think
if they could see us now?.

456
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,310
How can I ever face
the Tilneys again?.

457
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,634
You mustn't be cross
with John, dearest one.

458
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,236
Do you know, he told me he liked you
better than any girl he had ever seen.

459
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,431
And he thinks you're
the prettiest girl in Bath.

460
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,510
-I don't know why he should think that.
-No need for false modesty!

461
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,915
Now, how far have you got on with Udolpho?.

462
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,753
- I've just got to the black veil.
- The black veil!

463
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,189
I won't tell you what's behind it,
not for the world.

464
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,755
When you have finished it,
you will read The Monk, my brother's favourite.

465
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,839
Oh, yes, he spoke of it.
Is it really very horrid?.

466
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,316
It is the most horrid, shocking thing

467
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,759
in all the world.

468
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:26,430
Ambrosio the Monk begins very holy,
but is drawn into vice by Matilda.

469
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,278
She gives him a magic branch
so he can pass through walls...

470
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,073
..and into Antonia's bed chamber.

471
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,789
But it is too shocking. I should blush
to tell you.You must read it yourself.

472
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,952
"The Friar pronounced the magic words and
a thick smoke arose over the magic mirror.

473
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,798
At length, he beheld
Antonia 's lovely form.

474
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,796
She was undressing
to bathe herself

475
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,434
and the amorous monk
had full opportunity to observe

476
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,631
the voluptuous contours and
admirable symmetry of her person

477
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,477
as she drew off her last garment.

478
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,080
At this moment,
a tame linnet flew towards her,

479
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,669
nestled its head between her breasts
and nibbled them in wanton play.

480
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,472
Ambrosio could bear no more.

481
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,796
The blood boiled in his veins and
a raging fire rushed through his limbs.

482
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,912
'l must possess her,' he cried. "

483
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,509
No, no, Ambrosio.

484
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,518
I shall no longer be able
to combat my passions.

485
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:23,111
I am convinced with every moment,
that I have but one alternative...

486
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,516
I must enjoy you, or die!

487
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,554
Der Holle Rache
from The Magic Flute

488
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,917
Damn fine-looking woman.

489
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,756
But she's nothing to you, you know.

490
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,119
Miss Morland, Mrs Allen, Mr Allen.

491
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,509
Mr Tilney, you must have thought me so
rude,but they told me you had gone out.

492
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,677
When I saw you, I begged Mr Thorpe
to stop,but he only went faster.

493
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,917
If only he had slowed down,I would
have jumped out and run back to you.

494
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,157
Please believe me, I would ten thousand
times rather have been with you!

495
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,275
Are you and Miss Tilney
very angry with me?.

496
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,312
I must confess,
I felt a little slighted.

497
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,194
But my sister was quite sure
there was some misunderstanding.

498
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,198
Eleanor, you were right, as usual.

499
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,189
Miss Morland is not to blame.
She was abducted by force!

500
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,074
No, not exactly,
but truly I did try to make him stop.

501
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,875
Don't tease her. You were cast down when you
thought she preferred the company of others.

502
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,592
Perhaps she still does.

503
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,072
No, indeed!

504
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,673
That is...

505
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,714
Then may I renew our invitation?.

506
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,069
Shall we say the day after tomorrow
for our walk?.

507
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,115
Yes.

508
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,119
Miss Catherine Morland,a very
amiable girl, and very rich,too.

509
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,072
Ward of a Mr Allen, who made a fortune in trade.

510
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,270
And with no-one
to spend it on but her,

511
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,436
she'll bring a deal
of money to her marriage.

512
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,314
When the old man pops off, she'll be one
of the richest women in the country.

513
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,112
Obliged to you, sir.

514
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,276
Thorpe, John Thorpe.

515
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,390
Delighted to have been...

516
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,192
Yes, it was beautifully sung.

517
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,391
Mr Thorpe, perhaps you'd introduce me
to the young lady.

518
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,436
Miss Morland, this is General T:ilney.

519
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,553
Charming.

520
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,478
And did I overhear a country walk proposed?.

521
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,117
Yes, sir, the day after tomorrow.

522
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:19,470
Perhaps you would do us the honour
of spending the rest of the day with us,

523
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,748
after your walk?.

524
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,110
If Mr and Mrs Allen can be persuaded
to spare you?.

525
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,073
I'm sure they'd be happy to spare me, sir,
and I'd have great pleasure in coming.

526
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,792
Excellent.

527
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,879
I shall look forward to making
your better acquaintance, Miss Morland.

528
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,355
Ooh!

529
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,873
What do you think, Catherine?.
- It's wonderful.

530
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,153
It reminds me of the South of France.
The Languedoc, you know?.

531
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,872
ELEANOR: Yes!

532
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,480
Have you travelled much in France?.

533
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,714
No.

534
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,597
Not at all, I've never been there.

535
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,470
But I've seen pictures. And it's just
as Mrs Radcliffe describes it in Udolpho.

536
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,114
Ah! Mrs Radcliffe.

537
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,311
But I suppose
you don't read novels?.

538
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,920
I read Udolpho straight through
in two days,

539
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,474
with my hair standing up
on end the whole time.

540
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,750
I often think
there's more life,

541
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,392
and truth,

542
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,194
and feeling in a good novel
than in a hundred dull sermons.

543
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,871
Do you really believe that?.

544
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,591
Oh, go on, don't wait for me.

545
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,950
Why should you think
I don't believe it?.

546
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,711
Because I think you
like to tease me.

547
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,632
And because the real world is
different from the world in stories.

548
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,999
Is it?.

549
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,519
Of course it is!

550
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,237
I love to read Mrs Radcliffe,

551
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,159
but I don't think the real world's
full of murders and abductions

552
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,589
and ghosts with clanking chains

553
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,676
and seductions and everything.

554
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,439
Well, not in Fullerton, anyway.

555
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,913
Perhaps not quite so many murders
and abductions.

556
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,713
But broken hearts?. Betrayals?.

557
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,991
Long-held grudges?.
Schemes of revenge?.

558
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,233
Fear?.

559
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,794
And hatred?. And despair?.

560
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:28,150
Are they not part of all of our lives?.
Even in Fullerton?.

561
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,478
I don't know.

562
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,397
I would like to think not.

563
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,632
Well, then, I hope your experience of life
is the exception that proves the rule.

564
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,109
Tilney!

565
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,472
Forgive me, T:ilney, for interrupting
your walk. I've no time to lose.

566
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,636
Of course. You were expected.

567
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,589
Ma'am.

568
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,471
Come, let's walk on a little.

569
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,397
That gentleman is a close acquaintance
of ours, a very good friend.

570
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,398
He is obliged to leave
the country at short notice.

571
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,238
He was able to make his
farewells to me last evening,

572
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,398
but was no doubt anxious
to say goodbye to my sister, too,
before he left.

573
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,159
I see.

574
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,318
There is no reason
why the matter should come up.

575
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,796
But my sister and I would be very grateful
if you did not mention to my father

576
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,877
that we saw that gentleman here today.

577
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,112
No, of course.

578
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,799
Thank you.

579
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,437
The Monk reeled from
the unholy sight.

580
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,948
"Receive this talisman, "
she replied.

581
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,836
"While you bear this, every door will
fly open and walls will melt away.

582
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,398
It will procure you access tomorrow night
to Antonia 's bed chamber."

583
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,994
Miss Morland.

584
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,152
Nothing to be ashamed of.

585
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,475
It's all God's creation.

586
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,238
Come.

587
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,279
Catherine!

588
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,591
Catherine!

589
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,873
I absolutely knew the second you
came to the house. I could tell.

590
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,517
And the way you spoke to my mother,
I could just...It was almost like fate.

591
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,154
Catherine?.

592
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,077
No, no, sit down.

593
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,912
Can you guess?.

594
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,150
Your brother has made me
the happiest girl on Earth!

595
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,430
You mean, you and James...

596
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,754
Are in love!

597
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,155
He confessed as much
to me this afternoon.

598
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,431
And you know my nature,I could never
trifle with a man's affections.

599
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,392
In short, I told him
his love was returned.

600
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,319
Catherine!

601
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,918
He's waiting downstairs.

602
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,268
I know I needn't ask
whether you approve, Catherine.

603
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,639
No, indeed!

604
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,275
Though I am surprised.
It has all happened so quickly.

605
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,950
Not so. I believe I have been in love with
your friend since the first time I set eyes on her.

606
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,353
And l.

607
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,277
The very first day he came to us last Christmas,
the very first moment!

608
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,390
I remember I wore this yellow gown.

609
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,796
- My hair was up in braids.
- I am come to say goodbye, Catherine.

610
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,991
I am going straight to Fullerton
to seek our parents' consent.

611
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,792
Ah, Morland, there you are.

612
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,159
Miss Morland,

613
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,272
I, too, must take my leave for the present,
just for the present.

614
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:17,472
I'm going to accompany James to Fullerton,
and then onto town to help him choose a ring.

615
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,718
Perhaps I might look for one for myself
while I'm there. Do you think I should?.

616
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,556
A famous good thing, this marrying scheme.
What do you think of it?.

617
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,876
I think it's a very good thing, too.

618
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,036
I'm so pleased to hear you say that.

619
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,631
Did you ever hear the old song,
"going to one wedding brings on another"?.

620
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,079
Perhaps you and I might try the truth of that?.

621
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,072
I shall think of you, when I'm in town!

622
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,395
Come on, James, we must
tear ourselves away!

623
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,839
Go.

624
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,235
Go, perhaps, forever.

625
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,033
Isabella! Whatever do you mean?.

626
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,117
Your mother and father,
what will they say?.

627
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,038
I'm sure they'll be
very happy for James.

628
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:06,153
But my fortune will be so small.
How could they consent to it?.

629
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:09,397
Your brother, who might marry anybody.

630
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,991
I wouldn't think the difference in
fortune would be anything to signify.

631
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:19,353
Oh! My sweetest Catherine, in your generous
heart, I'm sure it would not matter at all.

632
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,800
But I mustn't expect everyone to think the same.

633
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,755
I only wish our situations
were reversed.

634
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,711
If I had the command of millions,

635
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,354
if I were mistress of the whole world...

636
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,998
..your brother would still
be my only choice.

637
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,070
Now, Catherine,you know I'm
only here for your sake.

638
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,111
You know my heart is 40 miles away.

639
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:51,157
And as for dancing,
don't mention it, I beg you.

640
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,997
It is quite out of the question.

641
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,157
I dare say Charles Hodge will plague me
to death about it.

642
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,236
But I shall cut him very short,
I can tell you.

643
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,111
I wonder where he is.

644
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,479
-It's General Tilney.
-I do believe he's coming to talk to you.

645
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,873
Miss Morland.

646
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,633
Delightful.

647
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,830
You will excuse me now.

648
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,594
Excellent.

649
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,074
Miss Morland,

650
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,556
allow me to introduce my brother,
Captain T:ilney.

651
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,989
Charmed.

652
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,391
Don't let my brother's ill manners
offend you.That's how he is, I'm afraid.

653
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,715
He was ill-mannered as a baby.

654
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,389
I'm surprised at you being so
disrespectful to your older brother.

655
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,711
How could you know
what he was like as a baby?.

656
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,115
When he was a baby,
you were not yet born.

657
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,718
True enough.

658
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,875
My mother told me of it.

659
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,514
I hope you're not already engaged
for the next dance?.

660
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,754
No, indeed.

661
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,837
- My rival having left Bath.
- lndeed he is not...

662
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,038
You mustn't tease me.

663
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,957
So do you not know Mr Thorpe at all?.

664
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,711
No, not at all.

665
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,911
That's strange. He seems to know
a great deal about your family.

666
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,315
And none of it to our credit?.

667
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,679
Well, I have always found

668
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:34,111
that ignorance and prejudice hold no bar
to forming the strongest of opinions.

669
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,754
You think him ignorant and prejudiced?.

670
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,076
I know he doesn't always tell the truth,
but he has been very kind to me.

671
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,073
You think he isn't to be trusted?.

672
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,359
Dear Miss Morland,

673
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,073
has it not occurred to you
that I might not be the best person

674
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,156
to consult on the matter of Mr Thorpe?.

675
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,839
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,

676
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,317
the next dance will be On A Summer's Day.

677
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,557
Good God, Henry. You're not going
to stand up in that maul, are you?.

678
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,159
I certainly am.

679
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,316
That being so...

680
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,790
..do you think your friend might dance with me?.

681
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:20,959
No! I am sorry. I know for certain that she has
a very particular reason not to dance tonight.

682
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,839
Is that so?.

683
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,679
Pity.

684
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,751
(Music starts)

685
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,513
- Why are you smiling?.
- Look there.

686
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,075
I don't wonder at your surprise.

687
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:23,910
I refused him for as long as I possibly could,
but he would not take no for an answer.

688
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,470
He's the eldest son, you know,
the heir to Northanger Abbey.

689
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,231
Not that that weighs anything with me.

690
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,874
I am in love with the best man
in the whole world.

691
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,031
Did you think him handsome?.

692
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,958
- Who?.
- Captain Tilney, silly!

693
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,319
Oh.

694
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:51,838
Yes, very handsome.

695
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,438
But didn't your brother say he was very bad?.

696
00:45:58,520 --> 00:45:59,953
As bad as Lord Byron?.

697
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,879
Oh, John will say anything
that comes into his head.

698
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,870
I hardly ever take any notice of him!

699
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,629
But then, how is one to
know what to believe?.

700
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,475
One thing you can be certain of - my affection.

701
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,671
For you and your dear,
dear brother.
