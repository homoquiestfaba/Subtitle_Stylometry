    and it gets interesting     
    around the stone age.       

266
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,024
    before the stone age,       
    i'm not sure how we hunted  

267
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,127
    'cause we didn't have stones
        to hit things with.     

268
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:59,931

324
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,502
now, stone napping is the art   
    of getting a stone

    and you chip away.

00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,911

and then you make arrowheads    

330
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:01,612
    and ax heads                
    and stuff like that.        

331
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,815
    and they believe            
    that stone napping,         

332
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,918
the art of it, was passed on    
with the use of language.       

333
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,853
they think that language        
was developed to pass this on   

334
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,555
    about a hundred             
    thousand years ago.

00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,692

00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,229
    but before that,            
    you can't have a god

00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,365

    this is my analysis here--

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,301

00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,618

    we just had conversations

354
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,972
    you wouldn't know about jam.

355
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,240
    you wouldn't join a library 
        and get the books.      

356
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:04,142
    you'd just forget it.       

357

    in blue and it's underlined,

00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:20,625
        then you click

00:43:02,646 --> 00:43:04,881
    can't stand the man myself. 

867
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,286
    civilization kicked off     
    with the egyptians          

868
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,588
    and the sumerians.          

869
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:12,655
    i don't know much           
    about the sumerians         

870
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,691
        'cause i haven't        
        wikipediad them.        

871
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:16,292
    but the egyptians,          
    they did stuff.             

872
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:19,329
they worshiped the sun god ra,  
which is slightly more logical  

873
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:23,032
    than worshiping             
    an invisible god, chris,    

874
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:26,035
    as the christians do.       

875
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,570
    if you're a christian,      

876
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,138
    you should be worshipping   
    chris, shouldn't you?       

877
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:34,077
        dear chris,             
    i'm a christian and...amen? 

878
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,545
    they quite like that,       

879
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:38,281
        but not really          
        like that, okay.        

880
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:39,749
    but he's invisible.         
    But the sun god is there.   

881
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,184
    he's there every day--      
    well, not the sun god,      

882
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,886
but the sun is, every day,      
and it's something more logical.

883
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,455
    i think--i think            
    they call them ra,          

884
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:46,923
    and they had a song for ra. 

885
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,592
         hurrah for ra,        
    he lives just over there   

886
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,028
 he comes up over there,       
and he goes down over there    

887
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:55,164
 i'm an egyptian, not a cowboy,
they've really gone too far    

888
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,568
     hurrah for ra,            
    he's a bit of a star       

889
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:02,572
    [ cheers and applause ]     

890
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:03,973
    you're just applauding      
    'cause i sang a song.       

891
00:44:04,008 --> 00:44:05,541
    that's how easy it is.      

892
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,844
    these singers get a way     
    with a hell of a lot.       

893
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,647
    they go ding-dong-bang,     
    ping-pong-pang.             

894
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:14,350
    hey, motherfuckers.         

895
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:18,254
            you see?            

896
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:20,156
    that song is on sale.       

897
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,659
        also in cd.             

898
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:25,728
    fuck it up, motherfuckers.  

899
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:29,098
    along with the ra,          
    hurrah for ra song.         

900
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,501
    i think <i>hurrah for ra</i>       
         would work.            

901
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,269
    they also have              
    a written language.         

902
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:35,171
    the ancient egyptians       
    had a written language,     

903
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:37,006
    which was a nightmare       
    for these news readers.     

904
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,474
        here is the news        
        in ancient egypt:       

905
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,511
    dog with a cat's face,      
    cat with a dog's face,      

906
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,479
        man with                
    a beautiful woman's face,   

907
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,716
        eye with legs,          
        a pot with legs,        

908
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,619
    two dogs, rabbit with       
    enormous--what is that?     

909
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:52,221
    i think a cat, a dog        
    or some sort of thing,      

910
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:54,590
    a mammal, one of those.     

911
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:58,661
    it seems the orgy           
    in the zoo continues        

912
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:01,297
    into its fourth century.    

913
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,865
        here is janine          
        with the weather.       

914
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,534
        thank you.              
    It'll be sunny forever.     

915
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:09,038
        thanks, janine.         

916
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:11,874
    now we're going over        
to our studio in ancient greece.

917
00:45:13,977 --> 00:45:16,312
and the greeks, they're more fun
    than the egyptians.         

918
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:17,714
        i like                  
    the ancient egyptians.      

919
00:45:17,748 --> 00:45:19,348
    they did some great stuff,  

920
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,618
    but the ancient greeks,     
    they got into athenians.    

921
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,021
    they invent democracy.      
    It's a greek word.          

922
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,823
    demos means people,         

923
00:45:26,857 --> 00:45:31,094
    ocracy is a kind            
    of inflatable cat seat.     

924
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:35,431
we think. We're not sure.       
The translation's a bit tricky. 

925
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:38,468
    they had city states,       
    the athenians, the thebans, 

926
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:42,872
    the bingibangians,          
    the spartans.               

927
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,874
    the spartans were fantastic.

928
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,376
    the spartans were, you know,
        elite troops,           

929
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,146
a nation of elite troops        
or a city state of elite troops,

930
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,348
    bastards, complete nut bags.

931
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:53,649
    they attack the country     
        next to them,           

932
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,052
    enslave those people        
    for 400 years,              

933
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,454
        and humiliated them     
        for 400 years.          

934
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,289
        bastards, really.       

935
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:02,558
    and they--the men,          
of course, were... [ Grunts ]   

936
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,993
        you know,               
    the spartan men...[ grunts ]

937
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:05,728
    spartan women...[ grunts ]  

938
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,096
    spartan children...         
    [ Grunts ]                  

939
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:10,666
    spartan dogs, woof.         
    Spartan cats, meow.         

940
00:46:10,701 --> 00:46:16,072
    spartan moles, aah.         

941
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:20,009
    spartan sheep, shh, silence.

942
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:22,478
        they were ninjas.       
        They were ninjas.       

943
00:46:22,513 --> 00:46:23,946
        they would wear         
    bandannas around the head   

944
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:26,516
    with the japanese writing   
    that they didn't understand 

945
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:30,119
    'cause they were sheep.     

946
00:46:30,154 --> 00:46:32,088
    and they would creep up     
        on their prey.          

947
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,289
    they would creep up--       

948
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:34,724
    no, they creep up           
    on their predators.         

949
00:46:34,758 --> 00:46:36,826
        the sheep would creep   
        on their predators.     

950
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:39,629
how insane is that? They were   
just mad. They had signals.     

951
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:40,830
    they would just creep along 
    in the dead of night.       

952
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:42,165
            [ poof ]            

953
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,051
    how are the sheep doing?    

954
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,259
    and they'd creep.           
They'd creep up on the wolves.  

955
00:47:10,294 --> 00:47:12,495
    the wolves would go, whoa.  

956
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,831
        he's a sheep.           

957
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:16,866
        we eat sheep.           

958
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:21,938
        is this delivery?       

959
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,773
        but the sheep,          
        they had no fear.       

960
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,341
    they would sit up           
    on their hind legs          

961
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,542
and they'd remove a rusty blade 

962
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,878
    from out of their...        
    Fancy swaths.               

963
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:32,682
and they would shear themselves 
    in front of the wolves.     

964
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:34,817
        [ scraping ]            

965
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,690
            come on.            

966
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:50,099
and they'd pull up the skin on  
their legs, just a little bit.  

967
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:53,069
    and the wolves will go,     
    this is all wrong.          

968
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:56,839
    grab their clothes and run. 

969
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,108
    so the wolves               
    in sheep's clothing         

970
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:01,911
    would run down the hill.    

971
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,479
        that's right.           

972
00:48:03,513 --> 00:48:05,414
        they'd run              
    into local markets,         

973
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:08,651
    and they'd order smoothies  
        and never pay.          

974
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:09,785
    "why didn't you take        
    their money?"               

975
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,221
"they said they'd invoice me."  

976
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:16,492
    they were wolves            
    in sheep's clothing.        

977
00:48:16,526 --> 00:48:18,094
    and it started the whole    
    spread of that wolves       

978
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,496
    in sheep's clothing,        
    dog's in cat's clothing,    

979
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,065
rabbits in buffalo's clothing,  

980
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,670
    mice in ant's clothing,     

981
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:29,839
    and the voles               
    in mole's clothing.         

982
00:48:29,873 --> 00:48:31,340
the voles are very small moles, 

983
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,476
    so voles in mole's clothing 
        is gonna...             

984
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:38,447
and then mole in voles'         
clothing, which is much more... 

985
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:42,818
    the spartans fought         
    a famous battle,            

986
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,120
    the battle of thermopylae,  

987
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:48,224
        made into a film        
        by shirley temple       

988
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,260

     <i>on the good ship lollipop.</i> 

989
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:52,728
        it's an anagram.        

990
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,131
     <i>on the good ship lollipop,</i>

    really nasty turn-in.       

1274
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,197

    were trying to get on--

    it could have happened.

died in 410 of the common era.  

1281

    and then, it went           
    into the dark ages

and the i-can't-really-see ages.

1283

    the medieval period,

01:14:29,431 --> 01:14:33,367
    now, moses, he was the one  
    in the bed of reeds.        

1479
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:35,136
    he was brought up as--      
    he was a hebrew person,     

1480
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:36,471
    brought up as an egyptian,  

1481
01:14:36,505 --> 01:14:39,240
    killed a slave owner        
    and then took off to hide   

1482
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:41,442
    'cause it was bad news      
        in those days.          

1483
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,010
    and then he went up         
    and he became a shepherd.   

1484
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:44,312
so he's looking after the sheep,

1485
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:46,080
    going, "yes, spartan sheep. 
        They're crazy."         

1486
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:47,615
        "oh, really."

    with japanese writing."

    "what does it mean?"        
    "no one knows."             

1489
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:56,791
    "not even japanese?"        
    "no, the japanese forgot."  

1490
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:59,160
        suddenly,               
    a bush caught fire.

    Let's get out of here."     

1493
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:05,633
and the bush that was on fire   
said, "moses, come back here."  

1494
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:08,135
        he goes, "ooh,

    it was a mistranslation,

    and the burning bush means  
    he was a volcanic mountain  

1541
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,186
        when he decided         
    to have the epiphany moment

    was written in greek

the ancient greek for virgin,

ancient greek for young woman   
    was the same word.

have a rest, let's move on.

    it takes away from the bloke

1555
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:41,589

        he really exists.       

1556
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:43,224
    i think the jesus guy,      
    the yeshua guy--            

1557
01:17:43,258 --> 01:17:45,192
    his real name was yeshua    
    back before was, you know,

    i think he was a real bloke.

1559
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:49,964
    i think he did stuff.       

1560
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:51,332
    and then he was the son     
    of a mystical thing         

1561
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:54,235
    and that devalues

1692

have others do unto you."

        no, probably not.
