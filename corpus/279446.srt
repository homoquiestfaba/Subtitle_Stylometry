1
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,470
What do you say
we get ourselves some turkey, partner?

2
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,950
They're here!

3
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,710
Now remember,
I want you kids to be especially nice to Danny.

4
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,390
- Why should we?
- Because I say so, that's why.

5
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,990
- Don't touch that pie.
- I'm hungry!

6
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,550
Hungry? You don't know what hunger is.

7
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,110
You want to know about hunger,
talk to the Russians.

8
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,030
- They'll tell you about hunger.
- Grace has Russia on the brain.

9
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,230
But they're so grand!

10
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,830
Now, Grace was your mom's best friend
back in England...

11
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,790
...and she's a little nuts, but she's nice.

12
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,110
Her husband is a professor of something.

13
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,270
There will be a lot of kids in there
for you to play with, too.

14
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,830
And I don't want you kids teasing Danny.
Do you understand me?

15
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,510
- What's the matter with him?
- Liz's boy.

16
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,110
She died last year.

17
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,990
- He found her body.
- That is just so awful.

18
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:54,630
He's very shy.

19
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:57,190
See? He is a retard.

20
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,070
What did I say about using that word
in this house, William Swan?

21
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,630
What did I say?

22
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,150
- You going to be okay, partner?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

23
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,110
You want a blindfold
or a cigarette or something?

24
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,630
- No.
- You sure?

25
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,150
Okay. Ring the doorbell.

26
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,150
Hey, sweetheart.

27
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,710
Danny, welcome!

28
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,110
- Look at how big you are!
- Yeah.

29
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,110
And don't you look like your mother!

30
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,870
When's the flag on that butterball gonna pop?

31
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,070
- Professor.
- Doctor.

32
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,630
- How you doing?
- Can't complain.

33
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,670
Why don't you and the kids watch
some football with Danny?

34
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,110
Give her the cake. There you go.

35
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,510
Thank you, Danny!

36
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,870
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Welcome.

37
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,950
Let's get you a drink.

38
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,510
You moved.

39
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,350
Keep your arms still!

40
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,870
I miss Liz so much.

41
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,430
I'll see something on the TV,
and I'll want to call her and tell her.

42
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,990
Yeah, I know what you mean.

43
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,150
Hank, would you mind?

44
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,870
No, not at all.

45
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,310
I can't imagine how Danny must miss her.

46
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,790
How can he understand a thing like that?

47
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,750
The shrink on the base says
eventually he'll come around.

48
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,390
Yeah, if nothing else, he's resilient.

49
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,870
Did you know that the domestic turkey
is unable to procreate naturally?

50
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,790
I thought only Konrad used that excuse.

51
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,470
We've genetically bred these poor birds
to have such large white-meat breasts...

52
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,670
...that it's impossible for them to copulate.

53
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,030
- Anything for white meat.
- How do turkeys do it?

54
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,550
Test tubes. The way we'd do it, if we were smart.

55
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,190
Richard is such a romantic.

56
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,270
Hank, I'm so happy that you and Danny
are going to be close by.

57
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,230
We're not. I signed on to
a NATO hospital outside of London.

58
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,150
- You did?
- You know, Liz's family's back there.

59
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,030
I figured that'd be good for Danny.

60
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,590
- When do you leave?
- A couple weeks.

61
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,550
We'll expect you next year.

62
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,190
Hold on. Let's put her on the couch over there.

63
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,990
- Okay.
- Don't push.

64
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,990
- You kids go outside and play!
- It's dark outside.

65
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,710
Take a flashlight!

66
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:29,750
- Can you hold on until the doctor gets here?
- Hank's a doctor.

67
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,230
- I'd prefer a sober one.
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.

68
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,590
Have you ever done this before?

69
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,030
We don't deliver many babies at the base.

70
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:39,110
We can hang on till that ambulance gets here.

71
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,630
- I don't think so.
- What do you mean, "I don't think so"?

72
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,150
What she means, Richard,
is that this baby is hot to be born.

73
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,950
Nothing we do is gonna change that.
Hold her knee up here.

74
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,990
- I'm sorry, I've got to push!
- Where the hell is the ambulance?

75
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,790
If you gotta push, push. Push.

76
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,430
Okay. Breathe, Gracie.

77
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,510
Okay, hold on. Gracie, listen to me.

78
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,790
You have done this before.

79
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,790
We gotta give this baby a little bit of help.

80
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,030
Push again. Ready?

81
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,790
All right. Ready. One, two, three. Push.

82
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,910
- Push, Grace.
- A little bit more. That a girl.

83
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,070
All right. Okay. Breathe.

84
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,470
- Son of a bitch.
- What?

85
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,790
We got a little problem here.

86
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:22,870
What do you mean, "a little problem"?

87
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,430
- Nothing I can't handle, all right?
- What?

88
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,630
The umbilical cord might be wrapped...

89
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,590
What do you mean, it might be wrapped?

90
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,830
It might be wrapped around the baby's neck.

91
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,670
Isn't there anything you can do about it?

92
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,470
I don't know, Richard. What do turkeys do?

93
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,830
Of course we can do something.
It's a common problem.

94
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:43,670
You! Get out of here!

95
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,790
Do what he says, son.

96
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,230
Breathe, Gracie, breathe.

97
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,550
- The retard's in there.
- Let me see!

98
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,590
No, wait. Come here a second.

99
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,550
Let me see your hands. Are they clean?

100
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,870
All right. Listen to me. Listen good, okay?

101
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,550
I want you to help me out.
I want you to reach in there...

102
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,910
Inside my wife?

103
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,630
Look, my hands are too big.
I'm too damn drunk. His hands are smaller.

104
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,910
- He can tell me what the problem is.
- Let him do it!

105
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,270
- Can you do this for me?
- What are they doing in there?

106
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,950
Can you do this for me?
Okay. Now, there's a baby in there.

107
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,670
I'll explain later.

108
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,950
I want you to reach inside really slowly,
very gently, with one hand, okay?

109
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,950
Go on. Put your hand in there.
Slowly, slowly. There you go.

110
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,550
Okay. Can you feel the baby?
Can you feel the baby's head?

111
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,430
- I don't believe this!
- Shut up, Richard!

112
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,870
Can you feel its neck?

113
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,110
All right. I want you to find the umbilical cord.

114
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,230
It's like a wet rope,
like the time we made that trailer hitch...

115
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,710
...and it's wrapped around the baby's neck.

116
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,390
I want you to uncurl it so the baby can be born.

117
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,270
- Can you feel it?
- He doesn't know what he's doing!

118
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,790
Keep trying, son. Come on.

119
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,910
- Keep trying.
- This is insane.

120
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,630
Think. You got it yet?

121
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,950
You do? You got it? You got it. Okay, good.

122
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,590
Now I want you to put your fingers...

123
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,270
...between the umbilical cord
and the baby's neck...

124
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,030
...so that when you uncurl it,
the baby can be born, okay?

125
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,350
All right. Can you do that for me?
Do it for me now, son. Come on.

126
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,430
- Just do what he says, son.
- Okay. You got it? You got hold of it?

127
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,790
Okay. Uncurl it.

128
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,870
Gentle. Slow.

129
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,790
Okay.

130
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,350
You think you got it done? You do?

131
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,070
- It's away from the baby's neck?
- Yeah.

132
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,630
Okay, now take your hand out gently.

133
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,750
Okay, Gracie, get ready to push, okay?

134
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,270
One, two, three, push.

135
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,990
- Push.
- Push, Grace.

136
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,270
Okay, Gracie, it's crowning.

137
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,350
Take a breath. One more. A big one.

138
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,550
- One, two, three, push!
- Push, Grace!

139
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,230
- Push!
- Okay!

140
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,630
It's a girl.

141
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,350
Look at her!

142
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,510
A beautiful girl.

143
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,350
Not so bad!

144
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,830
A beautiful girl.

145
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,630
Let's give her to her mama, son.

146
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,230
Careful. There you go.

147
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,470
Good job, son.

148
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,470
Anna.

149
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:42,390
Her name is Anna.

150
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,950
I'm gonna marry her.

151
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:47,510
I thought you and me were gonna live together!

152
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,710
What made you think that?

153
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:52,030
Probably when you said,
"When you get here, we'll live together. "

154
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,550
Here. Come on. Hurry up.

155
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:56,150
- These guys charge by the hour.
- I'm not crazy, am I?

156
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,830
That was the plan, wasn't it?
I come here. I get a job.

157
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,350
- We share a place. Right?
- I wrote you not to come.

158
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,150
I was on the road, wasn't I, coming here?

159
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,710
What did you say?

160
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,590
- I'm moving to New York.
- What's in New York?

161
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,710
- William.
- William?

162
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,430
William of New York?
Who's that? Like Joan of Arc?

163
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,870
Would you please be careful?

164
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:18,430
- I thought you loved me.
- Really? What made you think that?

165
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,750
Probably when you said, "I love you. "

166
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,510
That's really sweet, Danny,
but you're so damn literal.

167
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,790
It's a wonderful quality, okay? Don't lose it.

168
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,350
Thank you.

169
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,830
What am I going to do now?
Where am I going to live, Sarah?

170
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:39,230
I'll tell you what.
I'll sublet this apartment to you.

171
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,870
- How much?
- $1,600.

172
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:44,030
- A month?
- Yeah.

173
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,230
Okay. $1,550, but I can't go any lower than that.

174
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,670
There's a waiting list a mile long.
Take it or leave it.

175
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,150
No, not that box! Goddamn it!

176
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,630
I am never, ever going to fall in love again!

177
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,310
Good luck.

178
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,910
I don't need nobody.

179
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,310
- Tambini said that with the letter I'd get a job.
- Well, he was wrong.

180
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,990
- I've come all the way from London!
- You got a green card?

181
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,350
Yeah, I'm an American citizen.

182
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,750
I got 15 kids that are waiting to apprentice.

183
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,750
- I'm not an apprentice.
- What can I tell you, kid?

184
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,590
I don't have the money.
If I did, I would hire 10 of you.

185
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,950
I mean, look how much work I got to do here.

186
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,950
- Mel, you got to move that to the left!
- Okay, boss!

187
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,790
I could do that, sir. I'm the best!

188
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,750
You're the best?

189
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:16,790
Call me in a week.

190
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,990
But the way you talk, where are you from?

191
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,510
I'm from here.

192
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,950
I was born on an Army base outside of town...

193
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,510
...but I moved to England with my dad
when I was five.

194
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,510
- Is that right?
- He died last year, so...

195
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,830
You work delivery and the rent goes down.

196
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,150
Actually that might be useful,
because I'm waiting on a job.

197
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,950
- What do you do?
- Mosaics, you know?

198
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:10,590
- I work with tiles.
- Is there a call for that?

199
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,070
No, not enough. It's a dying art, really.

200
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,670
They use computers
to design mosaics nowadays.

201
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,670
It's like baking, you know?

202
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:23,550
Now it's all plastic,
plastic wrap and advertisement.

203
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,190
Actually, I noticed downstairs,
in front of the shop, you have red granite floors.

204
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:31,150
Pretty rare, from Italy, which is where I trained.

205
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,750
I wouldn't know.

206
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,790
This is it.

207
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,950
No smoking, no parties.

208
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,950
The girl before you here...

209
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,150
...she had parties.

210
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,750
Really?

211
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,470
- Smells good.
- Here you are.

212
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,550
Do you ride a bike?

213
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,110
- Yeah, I ride a bike.
- That's good.

214
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,350
Thank you.

215
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,470
Excuse me.
Do you know where Olmsted Street is?

216
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,590
Olmsted Street. Thanks for your help.

217
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,190
Who is it?

218
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,670
I'm sorry. I'm lost.
I'm trying to deliver this cake.

219
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:11,830
Where to?

220
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:16,830
That's all right. I'm looking for Olmsted Street.

221
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,190
Wait! Anna?

222
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,110
We'll be back later, Mother.
I thought you were coming with us.

223
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,830
I can't. I changed my mind.

224
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,670
- I won't let anything happen to you.
- Go with her. Have fun!

225
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,590
- I don't want to!
- Don't be silly.

226
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,470
I'm not being silly. I can't skate.

227
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,950
It's easy. I'll show you how.
I bet he can skate. Can you?

228
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,270
- Yeah, I can skate.
- See? Anyone can do it.

229
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,750
No, I'll just stay here with Mother.

230
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,510
Suit yourself. I'm late.

231
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,390
Just make sure to tell Irene
that I'll baby-sit Lily tonight.

232
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,270
And make sure Mother
takes her medicine at 2:00 and 4:00.

233
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:57,430
- All right.
- Can I help you with something?

234
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,910
This gentleman is looking for Olmsted Street.

235
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,510
Olmsted Street.

236
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,830
Okay, go up to the corner, take a left.

237
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,710
When you get to the second stop sign,
you pass a drugstore to the right...

238
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,830
...go up to the second stop sign...

239
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,350
...take a sharp right, and then left at the church.

240
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,430
Did you understand all that?

241
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,470
Yeah.

242
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,950
<i>You said that? Five years old?</i>

243
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:43,190
<i>"I'm going to marry her. "</i>

244
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:46,550
I know, my father told me that stupid story
millions of times.

245
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,710
- Now you meet her.
- It's kismet.

246
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,870
- Yeah. What's that?
- Fate.

247
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,910
Anna Swan, what a beautiful name.

248
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,950
Vicious birds, swans, vicious.

249
00:18:58,590 --> 00:18:59,950
What do you know about them?

250
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:03,110
Once they drowned a boy
in Boston in some park.

251
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,270
No. I mean the family.

252
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,470
Yes, they're very nice people.
They come in here sometimes.

253
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,230
Blind girl, she has a sweet tooth.

254
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,950
She loves raspberry tarts.

255
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,070
The mother is sick...

256
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:20,870
...and the one called Anna
spends a lot of time with her.

257
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,390
- Does she live there?
- I don't think so. Why?

258
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,110
- He's in love with her.
- No, no. I'm not in love with her.

259
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,870
When you least want it, love happens.

260
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,830
Like appendicitis.

261
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:34,870
<i>I promise you, this is not love. I know love.</i>

262
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,150
<i>No, when I fall in love,
it's like an alien invasion in my body.</i>

263
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,590
<i>I turn out like a complete idiot.</i>

264
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:43,630
<i>I won't say it won't happen to me again,
but it won't be this time.</i>

265
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,750
And what's the event?

266
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,190
She didn't say.
She just called up and ordered the cake.

267
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,830
- Nothing written on it?
- No.

268
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:58,550
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

269
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,590
You don't want to take it?

270
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:04,510
No, I'll take it. It's my chance to meet them.

271
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,430
- Yes, coincidence.
- Exactly!

272
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,710
I can deliver the cake.

273
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,150
I recognize the house,
see the name on the door...

274
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,350
...introduce myself.

275
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,150
This is your chance to meet the young lady.

276
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,230
Yeah.

277
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,670
Anna.

278
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:25,870
What is she? She's, you know,
not an astronaut or anything, is she?

279
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,630
- She's just a woman, right?
- Correct.

280
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,710
Right. The world's full of women.

281
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,630
- More than men.
- Exactly! No big deal.

282
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,670
I helped deliver her.
What's, you know, the big deal?

283
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,310
Two normal people being introduced.

284
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,550
Take all the mystery out of this situation,
and then we can just be friends.

285
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,670
Right.

286
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,550
Okay. Here. Give me the cake.

287
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,670
Hi. I'm Danny Kowalski.

288
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:55,150
I delivered you,
and now I'm delivering you a cake.

289
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,110
Hi. Remember me?

290
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,590
I'm Danny Kowalski.

291
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,670
I remember you.

292
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,230
I really remember you.

293
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,550
It's me, Danny Kowalski. Remember?

294
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,870
Hi.

295
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,390
I'm Danny.

296
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,790
- Hi!
- Hi, honey.

297
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,150
I'm glad you're here.

298
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,310
My God.

299
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,310
- You shouldn't move.
- Here, I'll put this... Is this cold?

300
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,070
- Now that blood will never come out.
- What happened?

301
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,950
- The delivery boy fell off his bike.
- I'm all right, really.

302
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,790
- I have your cake somewhere.
- That must be the cake I ordered.

303
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:50,830
What's the occasion?

304
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,750
- Are you okay?
- He'll probably sue.

305
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,550
- You think so?
- I would.

306
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,630
- I'll call an ambulance.
- No!

307
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,710
- Keep still, you idiot!
- I'm all right.

308
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,030
No. Really. Thank you. I'm all right.

309
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,390
I'm fine.

310
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,630
Hello. My name's Danny.

311
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,310
Danny Kowalski.

312
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,110
Oh, no.

313
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,270
Here. Watch his head.

314
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,910
- Give him room. Just give him some space.
- Let's get him inside.

315
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,630
Hello.

316
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,510
No, wait.

317
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,990
Stop screaming!

318
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,430
Anna, would you fetch that for me?

319
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,750
- Billy, come out of the refrigerator.
- Where's that beer I bought?

320
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:10,590
- You drank it, Billy.
- Hello.

321
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,590
Daniel! There you are!

322
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,470
- Are you feeling better?
- Much better, thank you.

323
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,190
- Everybody...
- Hi.

324
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,430
Listen.

325
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,070
This is the man-child...

326
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:33,070
...who thrust these very hands...

327
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,110
...deep inside my reluctant womb...

328
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,590
...and wrestled...

329
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:49,510
...until he had wrenched life itself...

330
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,830
...from my unwilling loins.

331
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,150
- Come here!
- That's extraordinary!

332
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,030
That's the retard! You're the retard.

333
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,030
Here she is.

334
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:04,470
- Anna, come here.
- I thought you were kidding.

335
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:07,670
Isn't she magnificent?

336
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,230
Mother, please.

337
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,430
Hi. Nice to meet you.

338
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,030
Last time we met, you were covered in afterbirth.

339
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:19,350
- There's a line I bet you never heard before.
- Danny, this is Eric.

340
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,550
Danny is the man responsible
for bringing me into the world.

341
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,790
I'm very grateful.
It'd be a less interesting place without her.

342
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,950
- Think nothing of it.
- Glad you're feeling better.

343
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,670
- I'm Karen.
- Hi.

344
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,950
- Is that your baby?
- Right.

345
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,150
- Hello.
- Can you bring the baby in here, please?

346
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,150
- Why'd you fire her?
- I don't like her.

347
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,150
She read too fast and she skipped parts.

348
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,950
He hired his girlfriend to read for you.

349
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,590
She wasn't one of my girlfriends.

350
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,910
Right. Your girlfriends don't know how to read.

351
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,430
Honey. That's so ridiculous.

352
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,830
Don't start that thing.

353
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:05,030
Mother used to read for me,
but she finds it hard to breathe now.

354
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,710
What's that sound?

355
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,470
These are...

356
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,910
These are pieces of tile
I keep on me for good luck.

357
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,830
Really? Can I feel?

358
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,790
Yeah. Here. That's a piece of red marble.

359
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,790
And that's...

360
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,150
That's a piece of malachite,
another piece of marble.

361
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,870
Is something wrong?

362
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,430
No.

363
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,230
Are you sure?

364
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,430
Yeah. I'm fine. You can keep those.

365
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,670
- Really? Thank you.
- Feel nice?

366
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,510
Yeah. I like it.

367
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,270
For good luck?

368
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,030
Good luck.

369
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,830
Do you want corn?

370
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,190
- We have to find someone to read for Nina.
- She uses them up like tissue.

371
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,110
I do not. I don't go through like tissue paper.

372
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,710
Does everybody know that Daniel's a tiler?

373
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,150
Maybe he could do our guest bathroom, honey.

374
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,830
Not that sort of tiler. Danny's an artist.

375
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,790
- It's a nice bathroom.
- I restore mosaics.

376
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,230
Interesting.

377
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,110
Yeah. Mr. Tambini, my teacher and mentor...

378
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,070
...said that I have great potential,
potential to be a master tiler.

379
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,350
Fascinating.

380
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,470
- Do you ever do your own work?
- Just restoration at the moment.

381
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,830
- You don't find that limiting?
- Actually, I do.

382
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,150
So, basically you're a repairman.

383
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,990
- Would you like some wine?
- You know, alcohol is poison.

384
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,030
Please!

385
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:28,150
Karen, you're the Ralph Nader of gastronomy.

386
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,350
I'm just telling you the facts.

387
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,470
I read once where they took a rat...

388
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,350
...and injected him with alcohol
20 times a day for five years.

389
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,430
- You know what it died of?
- Holes?

390
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,390
- I like this guy.
- Why don't you have some parsley?

391
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,590
Karen, please.
We have to find someone to read for Nina.

392
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,390
<i>I'm going to read Anna Karenina.</i>

393
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,350
That is the greatest love story ever written.

394
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:56,150
- Don't talk about love while I'm eating.
- Father doesn't believe in love.

395
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,270
Daniel's a romantic. I can tell.

396
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:02,230
You've been in love, haven't you, Danny?

397
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,030
Yes, I have, actually.

398
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:07,390
You have? What's it like? Tell me.

399
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,230
I'm all pins and needles.

400
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,230
What's it like?

401
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,030
All right.

402
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,630
You know how...

403
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,870
...when you listen to music
playing from another room...

404
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,910
...and you're singing,
because it's a tune that you really love...

405
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:27,390
...when a door closes or a train passes,
so you can't hear the music anymore...

406
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,390
...but you sing along anyway.

407
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,630
Then, no matter how much time passes...

408
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:37,950
...when you hear the music again,
you're still in exact same time with it.

409
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,110
That's what it's like.

410
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,550
I think.

411
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,310
Made my wife cry.

412
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,470
Thank you, Daniel.

413
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,950
That's a good introduction
to what I have to tell you.

414
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:01,430
- I think I'm going to kill myself.
- Irene!

415
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:04,590
- And then I'm going to kill him.
- Oh, no.

416
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,070
Please, don't keep doing that, Irene.

417
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:09,990
Must we go through this every night?

418
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:14,670
Honey, how many times do I have to tell you?
You shoot me, then yourself.

419
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,230
That's how it goes. Me, then you.

420
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,870
- Me, then you.
- Irene.

421
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,310
Don't worry.
Her therapist never gives her bullets.

422
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:24,910
- Unfortunately.
- Bite me.

423
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:28,790
- Give her the gun.
- Okay, here, take it.

424
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,550
You know, I got it out of my system,
and I feel much better.

425
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,910
Yes, in the words of John Wilkes Booth.

426
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,830
- She likes to carry it.
- I thought it was real.

427
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,670
Okay, Anna. What was it you wanted to tell us?

428
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,550
She was going to say
that she and I are officially engaged.

429
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:50,150
Anna, that's wonderful! Congratulations!

430
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,110
- There you go, finally!
- It's about time.

431
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,590
- When will it be?
- We haven't set a date yet.

432
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,150
Congratulations, Eric.

433
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,990
That's so wonderful!

434
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,030
Finally! It's about time.

435
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,590
I could read for you, Nina.

436
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,790
- What?
- I could read for you.

437
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,470
Daniel says he'll read for me!

438
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,430
Is that all right? Can Daniel read for me?

439
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,590
I think that's a wonderful idea. Richard?

440
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,150
I don't care.

441
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,070
<i>"Arriving in Moscow, Levin was surprised...</i>

442
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,710
<i>"... to find the Oblonsky household
in total confusion.</i>

443
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,030
<i>"He was alone, in that he could tell no one...</i>

444
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,790
<i>"... of his plans to marry Kitty.</i>

445
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:27,070
<i>"At 4:00 that afternoon...</i>

446
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:29,870
<i>"... Levin got out of the sleigh
at the zoological gardens.</i>

447
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,990
"Well-dressed people,
their hats shining in the sunlight...

448
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,830
"... crowded at the gates.

449
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:38,190
"Levin walked along the path
leading to the skating lake...

450
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:40,310
"... and he kept repeating to himself:

451
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,990
"'I must not be excited. I must be quiet.

452
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:46,110
"'What are you doing? What's the matter?
Be quiet, stupid! '...

453
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,950
"... he said to his heart. "

454
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,990
- It's not working, is it?
- What? What do you mean?

455
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,550
We should be outside.
This takes place in the garden.

456
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,070
- We should be in a garden.
- No.

457
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,510
No, we can't do that.

458
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,470
Why don't you go down to the garden
where Anna works?

459
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:04,790
- That's a great idea.
- No. I can't leave Mother.

460
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,350
Of course, you can. I'll be fine.

461
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,750
I'll get your coat.

462
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,190
You won't need a coat.
It's a beautiful day. Come on.

463
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,470
Come on, Nina. It'll do you good.

464
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:15,070
Come on, Nina.

465
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,030
"He had to make an effort,
and reason with himself...

466
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,750
"... that all sorts of people were passing him...

467
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:24,910
"... and that he himself might've come...

468
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,350
"... just to skate. "

469
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:28,270
I hear a bee. Do you see it?

470
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,910
No. Must've gone.

471
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,590
"He stepped down,
avoiding any long look at her...

472
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:34,470
"... as one avoids long looks at the sun... "

473
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,430
A bee.

474
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,750
"But seeing her as one sees the sun...

475
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,710
"... without looking. "

476
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,670
That bee is still around.

477
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:45,910
- No, there's no bee near you. I promise.
- Yes, there is!

478
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:48,750
I can hear it better than you.
Get it away from me!

479
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,510
- I can't stand bees!
- Nina, relax.

480
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,390
- There's bees all around me!
- I'm here.

481
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,430
- Just stand still.
- There's bees all over me!

482
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,710
There's nothing around you. Nina, stop it!

483
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,430
I hate bees.

484
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,790
- I'm very, very sorry.
- Why did you bring her here?

485
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:23,350
- It was your mother's idea.
- She's not comfortable in places like this.

486
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,710
You did say that she should get out more.

487
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,670
Yes, she should, with me.

488
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:32,070
- Why only with you?
- Because she trusts me, that's why.

489
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,110
I think you treat her like a baby. I'm sorry.

490
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,070
- You wouldn't understand.
- No, I understand.

491
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,550
- Nina and I have a special relationship.
- I understand.

492
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,510
I'm her connection to the sighted world.

493
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,990
Maybe she should have
somebody else do that for her...

494
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,470
...for a change.

495
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:49,350
Well, you know what? I don't think
you're the right person to read for her.

496
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:51,870
- Why not?
- Isn't it obvious?

497
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,790
- Are you firing me?
- Yes!

498
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,670
- Yes, I'm firing you.
- Why?

499
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,510
Because Nina needs somebody who's more...

500
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,310
There's a bee on you.

501
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,710
- Jesus! More what, intellectual?
- No.

502
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,910
- Academic?
- No, quite the opposite. Simple.

503
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:09,070
This is a job for a retired teacher,
or a child, not a workman.

504
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,150
I don't agree.

505
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:14,230
You just met my family,
and you're gonna tell us how to run our lives?

506
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:18,630
No! That is not what I meant.
What I meant was that Nina...

507
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,270
You're provoking it.

508
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,070
Fascinating creatures, bees.

509
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:28,990
Each one has its responsibility,
it completes it, and then it dies.

510
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,670
Is that what you're going to do?

511
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,190
- What?
- Are you happy, Anna?

512
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,750
Yes! Yes, I'm happy!

513
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,350
No, I don't think you are.

514
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,310
Why did you ask the question
if you already knew the answer?

515
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,110
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

516
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:45,310
Great. What a relief. Everybody's happy.

517
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,310
- I overreacted. I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

518
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,750
- Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.
- I'm very sorry.

519
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:01,510
No. You know what?
I'm glad you suggested we come here.

520
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,350
It was kind of exciting.

521
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,470
Do you want to stay and read some more?

522
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,830
No. I want to go home now. Thank you.

523
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,430
See you tomorrow.

524
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,230
Bye.

525
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,950
Mr. Palmieri, you will not be sorry, sir.
I'm a magician with marble. You'll see.

526
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:40,070
If I wanted a magician, I would've hired Houdini.

527
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,350
Let's look at these plans over here.

528
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,190
Have 'em cleaned by lunch, Michelangelo.

529
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,190
So, yeah, it's a feminist theater company.

530
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,070
"Actors Without Dicks. "

531
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,150
Catchy.

532
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,750
There's no parts for women,
and we're doing something about it.

533
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,670
- Lf that's all right with you.
- That's fine. Ladies' first.

534
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,070
Absolutely.

535
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,390
It's like a Diane Arbus audition in here.

536
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:40,510
Danny, I saved you your favorite Danish pastry,
the one you like.

537
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,750
- You spoil me, Clara.
- You deserve it.

538
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,790
- Look at all this sugar. It's poison.
- Come on. I've only got 10 minutes.

539
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:52,190
Anyway, the only guy we cast in the play
got a real job, so he had to leave.

540
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,470
Wait a minute.
Did you just stick your tongue out at me?

541
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:00,350
Look, Danny, this filthy semi-literate yahoo
wants to do me!

542
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:03,910
- Dreams do come true!
- It's her medication. Karen!

543
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,790
Sure, I want to.
Right now. Right here on this table.

544
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,470
- I didn't mean to bother you.
- Why not?

545
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:12,390
The way that jelly clings to your chin,
it's so sexy. Look at you!

546
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:15,950
And that pasty white gut
cascades over your belt...

547
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,510
...like water in a dream.

548
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:24,390
- What more could a woman want?
- What, you think we don't have brains?

549
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,710
I don't think you have central nervous systems.

550
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,430
- Can I have one of these?
- Karen, come on.

551
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:32,630
Karen! Excuse me.

552
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,590
I work with these guys. Have some respect.

553
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,950
I hate that shit!

554
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,110
They think you're beautiful.
What's the big deal?

555
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,510
Please! I'm a disaster.

556
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,070
Look at me. I'm 29 years old.

557
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,070
You know how old I'm going to be next year?

558
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,110
30?

559
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,910
Don't mock me.
Do you want to do the part or not?

560
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,870
No. I'm sorry. I can't act.

561
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,710
That doesn't stop anyone else in show business.

562
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,990
Unfortunately you can't have any lines,
because you're a man.

563
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,950
You stand on stage like a prop.
That shouldn't be hard for you.

564
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,830
I would like to help, but I'm working now.

565
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,870
Anna's making the costumes.

566
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,510
Is she?

567
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:11,190
My God, you're all the same.

568
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:12,830
What?

569
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,790
You're about as subtle as a truck.

570
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,550
I just licked my lips.

571
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:22,510
- At least you don't go for the easy ones.
- What do you mean?

572
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,590
You foam at the mouth
every time she walks into the room.

573
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,790
- Who?
- Who? Anna, who else?

574
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,870
You know, you might actually be good for her.

575
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,430
Screw up her perfect little life.

576
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,790
- Anna has a perfect life?
- She likes to think so.

577
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,310
You mean Eric.

578
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,630
He's rich, he's charming, everyone loves him.

579
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:51,670
You play me right, though,
I can help you land my little sister.

580
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,350
First rehearsal's Thursday.

581
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:56,190
All right.

582
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,870
- Have a nice day.
- Too late.

583
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,430
Don't look at me.

584
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,230
It's to do with independence, individuals...

585
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,550
No. I think good marriages...

586
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,510
...are really based on something in common.

587
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,150
You know, some couples travel,
some shop, some garden.

588
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,230
Billy and me, we break up.

589
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,990
That's what we share, breaking up.

590
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,110
He has an affair, I stop eating for a while...

591
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,190
...and then we have a huge fight,
and our relationship is over...

592
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,750
...and we break up.

593
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,870
But while we're doing that...

594
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,550
...all the passion
that seeped out of our relationship...

595
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:34,510
...comes rushing back in, and he says:

596
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,510
"Please, don't leave me.
I can't live without you. "

597
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,910
Until we're back together
and everything's back the way it was...

598
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:42,710
...until we break up again.

599
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,430
- I mean, it's really kind of pathetic, isn't it?
- No.

600
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,550
It's whatever works for you.

601
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,910
Billy, give me that.

602
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:53,710
- Anna has a secret admirer.
- Okay, but just please give it to her.

603
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,390
I'm gonna strangle you.

604
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:00,110
Sometimes I really think about leaving him,
but then I don't...

605
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,670
...'cause I really think that would
force us together even more.

606
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,310
Billy, he's a moron.

607
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,270
He's a good moron, though.

608
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:14,990
- Billy doesn't get anything.
- Thank you.

609
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,030
What did I miss?

610
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,750
Look at this. Anna has a secret admirer.

611
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:21,230
He's probably a teenager
who works at the garden.

612
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,190
How do you know it's a he?

613
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,590
I'm sorry, I don't go for that stuff.

614
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,870
Eric, read it.

615
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,910
The male sea lion...

616
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,070
...wants a female.

617
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:37,110
- He rolls over, dangles his erect member...
- God, Daddy!

618
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,830
...in front of her, and presto...

619
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,150
...perpetuation of the species.

620
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:45,910
- That's how Billy met Irene.
- Don't flatter me. That's my favorite story.

621
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,950
You should read this for all of us.

622
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,470
You know what?
Don't read it, it's not necessary.

623
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,390
I want to see what my competition is.
It's a poem.

624
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,790
"Wanted, wanted, Anna Swan. "

625
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,870
That's enough.

626
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:01,070
- No, no. Go on, we wanna hear.
- The public clamors, honey.

627
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,750
"Wanted, wanted, Anna Swan.

628
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,750
"Hair, blonde. Eyes, on fire.

629
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:09,350
"Age, 9,000 days already gone. "

630
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,550
What's that in layman terms?

631
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,870
"Already in love or maybe a liar... "

632
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,830
That's enough!

633
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,110
- Continue!
- This is good.

634
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,150
"Approach with caution, Anna Swan.

635
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,270
"Your soul's a sitting duck.

636
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,110
"Armed and dangerous, Anna Swan.

637
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,590
"My heart's a bell already struck. "

638
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,950
Children present. Sorry.

639
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,270
"I'm dying, expiring, Anna Swan.

640
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,790
"The experts all assure me.

641
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,750
"My only hope is Anna Swan.

642
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,950
"Only your love can cure me. "

643
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,350
Let's get the cake!

644
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:41,590
- Happy birthday, Daddy.
- Happy birthday.

645
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,710
- Happy birthday, Bill.
- Thank you.

646
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:46,630
- Happy birthday, old man.
- Happy birthday.

647
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,710
Here you go.

648
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:50,390
Do you have the proper amount
of candles, Mom?

649
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:54,230
<i>- Who took my eyeliner? Jennifer?
- Don't look at me. Emma had it.</i>

650
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,630
- God, I need a cigarette.
- There's no smoking in here.

651
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,590
You have to fix my tail.

652
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,670
- Don't do that again.
- Do what again?

653
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:05,070
- Send me an anonymous poem.
- How do you know it was me?

654
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:08,470
- Who else would write such drivel?
- What do you mean, drivel?

655
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,070
My God, that's disgusting. Looks like my father.

656
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,670
- This is mine?
- Yeah. Here are your claws.

657
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,030
No, you mean trotters.

658
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,990
Trotters, claws.
Whatever pigs have, those are them.

659
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:22,030
Anna, make sure you put it on really tight...

660
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,030
...so it doesn't fly off
when they hit him with the baseball bat.

661
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,390
<i>Wait. There's no baseball-bat scene in Medea.</i>

662
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,670
Don't worry.
We put padding on the inside. See?

663
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,430
Okay? It's a big house out there, everybody.

664
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,230
You look great. Break a leg!

665
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,550
Places!

666
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:43,990
Okay, that should hold,
so don't be pulling on it again.

667
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,030
Don't let your tail drag.

668
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,910
Your mom liked my poem.

669
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,070
Please. "My heart's a bell already struck,"
or something like that.

670
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,510
- No, that was it. That was it exactly.
- I told you, natural fabrics.

671
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:58,110
- I cannot wear anything but natural fabrics.
- Switch with Helen.

672
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:01,630
- Green? You can't be serious.
- You look nice in green. Really.

673
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:02,750
No!

674
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,710
You know what?
You're not fooling anyone, you know.

675
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,950
I mean, everyone knows it. It's so obvious.

676
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,870
You're getting into all of our lives
to be around me, so end it!

677
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:11,870
- I can't.
- Why?

678
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,910
Because I love you.

679
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:15,830
- Please! Are you always this insipid?
- No. You inspire me.

680
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:19,670
Finally. A purpose in life. Pick up your tail.

681
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,430
Anna, please. Run away with me.

682
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,710
Run away with me and marry me tomorrow.

683
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:29,750
- I'm being seduced by a 6-foot pig.
- Story of my life. Come on.

684
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:33,430
You know, does it bother you at all
that I'm engaged to be married?

685
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:36,710
- I think you should have a choice.
- Thank you. I love choices.

686
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,790
Let me think. I'll choose Eric.

687
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:41,270
- That wasn't very hard, was it?
- It didn't seem to be.

688
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:42,710
- You want to know why?
- Not really.

689
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:44,270
No? I'm gonna tell you why.

690
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,510
First, there's the fact
that I have everything in common with Eric...

691
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,350
...and nothing in common with you.
- Right.

692
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,190
- He's exceptionally brilliant...
- Really?

693
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:54,830
- He makes six figures a year.
- So do I. Of course, the first two are zeroes.

694
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,550
I'm only mentioning money
because at one time or another...

695
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,310
...he's kept every member of my family
financially afloat...

696
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,910
...and asked for nothing in return.

697
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:05,750
- What more could a girl ask for?
- Last but not least, he's a wonderful lover.

698
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,830
You're lucky you found him before I did.

699
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:10,670
"Here comes our sacrifice, Diana. "

700
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,070
This is our cue.

701
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,150
"It is Medea. "

702
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,390
When are you gonna get married?

703
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,310
We haven't decided yet. Get out there!

704
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,310
Why not?

705
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:19,630
"Where is our sacrifice, sisters?"

706
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,590
- Get out there!
- You're on, porky.

707
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,790
Wait a minute. Listen to me.

708
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:25,070
"Perhaps we should
send someone to look for him. "

709
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,510
He's coming!

710
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,070
Know this, I would marry you yesterday.

711
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:01,270
Anna, could you help me with the mask?

712
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:19,310
Wait!

713
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,350
Taxi!

714
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:24,750
- Get away from me.
- Anna, just wait.

715
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,470
- 430 South Cornwall. Go!
- Just wait.

716
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:31,910
- Go, please!
- Just wait, please.

717
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:33,990
All right, answer me one question.

718
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:37,390
- You're gonna get killed.
- Does he make you laugh?

719
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:41,550
Yes! Yes, he does. Are you happy?
Just go, please.

720
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:45,750
- He'll never love you like I can. I promise.
- Thank God for small favors.

721
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:48,270
I'd marry you tomorrow.
I'd have children with you.

722
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,070
Dozens and dozens of children.

723
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,670
Let's hope they look like the mother.

724
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:29,110
Let's go somewhere.

725
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:30,870
Where?

726
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,390
I don't know.
The desert, the ocean, the mountains.

727
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:38,710
- The bed.
- When I finish. I can't...

728
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:39,790
No!

729
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:41,510
What are you doing?

730
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:44,430
Come on. We always used to do it on this desk.

731
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,270
- Did we?
- Did we? Yes.

732
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:51,030
<i>- Yes, we did.
- You've been reading Cosmopolitan again.</i>

733
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:54,950
Very funny. Come on.
Do what you used to do to me.

734
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,750
- What would that be?
- You know.

735
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,030
- You never do that anymore.
- I do.

736
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:03,270
- No, you don't.
- I don't?

737
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:04,910
You don't. Just do it!

738
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,870
- Now?
- Yes! Now.

739
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:13,510
- I'll finish this, then I'm taking a break.
- You sleeping with her?

740
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:14,830
- You sleeping with my wife?
- No.

741
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:16,390
- That's not what she said.
- I'm not.

742
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:17,430
- You're lying.
- I'm not.

743
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:18,990
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

744
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:22,230
How come she's so preoccupied with you?
Totally. What are you doing?

745
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:23,910
You hunting down the women in my life?

746
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:28,630
Billy, listen. She calls me, all right?
She calls me, just to talk to me.

747
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:29,710
All right.

748
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:32,830
You're right.
What would you be sleeping with her for?

749
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:34,310
You're right. Okay.

750
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:36,750
I'm gonna tell you something.
I'm gonna tell you once.

751
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:39,670
Don't talk to my wife, all right?
If she calls, you hang up.

752
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,790
You're filling her head with shit about love...

753
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,510
...and manifesting your own destiny.

754
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:46,910
She's talking about going back
to that half-wit marriage counselor again.

755
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:48,670
Maybe you should go.

756
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:52,550
- What did you just say?
- Maybe you should go.

757
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:55,750
That is easy for you to say,
because you're not married to her.

758
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,390
Do me a favor. Please stay out of my life.

759
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,310
Stay out of my sister's life, too.

760
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:01,670
- Nina?
- No, not Nina. Anna.

761
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:03,590
You think we're all blind?

762
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:06,710
She's too polite to say you're a fool,
but I am not.

763
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:08,350
You are making an ass of yourself.

764
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:09,390
You okay, Danny?

765
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,950
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna hurt him. I'm a doctor.

766
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:14,390
I got triple-bypass surgery in 20 minutes.

767
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:18,710
No one in my family likes you,
except my mom, 'cause she's crazy...

768
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:20,790
...and Nina, 'cause she's blind.

769
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:22,430
Switch me over to OR.

770
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:25,390
If they let you glom onto them,
that's their problem.

771
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,350
But whatever you do, you stay away from Irene.

772
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:34,510
This is Dr. Swan. Can you prep Mr. Stanton?
I'll be there in about 20 minutes.

773
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:52,630
In love, that's all you need.

774
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:56,310
- Money. I know.
- No, not money. Show him.

775
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,070
See? The coin with two heads.

776
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,670
Your lady says she doesn't want to make love...

777
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:04,030
...so you say, "We let fate decide. "

778
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,590
Women love fate.

779
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:09,630
- Is that right?
- Heads, we make love.

780
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,110
Tails, I go away and don't bother you again.

781
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,470
You're saying I should cheat?

782
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:16,870
What do you mean, cheat?

783
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:17,910
Cheat.

784
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:21,230
You know, cheat, trick, swindle, dupe.
I couldn't do that.

785
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:22,270
Why not?

786
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:25,150
Because there are some things
that either work or don't work.

787
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:26,710
You can't make it work.

788
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:29,550
It's chemistry. I prefer to take chances.

789
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:35,990
Give me the coin.

790
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,110
Thank you.

791
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,070
<i>"As anticipated...</i>

792
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:50,830
<i>"... the cream of Moscow society
had flocked to the annual ball.</i>

793
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:54,910
"The entrance was lit by chandeliers
and decorated with flowers.

794
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:58,310
"From the many rooms
came a murmur of excited voices.

795
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:02,270
"As the women arranged their hair,
the band played the first waltz.

796
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,150
"The whole ball was for Kitty.

797
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:08,150
"An enchanted dream of color...

798
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:10,030
"... sound, and movement. "

799
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:12,790
- What was that?
- It was just some guy going to the bar.

800
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:15,270
- I want to go home.
- No, Nina.

801
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,230
This is the perfect place to read this.

802
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,590
- It's exactly like in the book.
- I don't believe you.

803
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:21,110
Okay, listen.

804
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:25,590
"As soon as she entered the ballroom,
Kitty was asked to waltz by the best... "

805
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:27,830
I'm not gonna dance
with either of you shitheads.

806
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:31,310
- Who are you gonna dance with, then?
- I want to go home. I really want to.

807
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:33,230
Just make believe you're at a ball.

808
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,190
You're in Moscow, dancing the mazurka.

809
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:37,910
- No, I don't want to dance...
- Come on, baby, dance with me.

810
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,830
Me? No, I can't dance right now. Sorry.

811
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,910
Look, I just want to dance with your man.

812
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:44,430
- He's not my man.
- She's asking you to dance, dude.

813
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:46,270
- I can't.
- You insulting my lady?

814
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,110
No. I'm not insulting anybody's lady.

815
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,270
If you touch him, Jose, I'll cut you!

816
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:56,830
- All right, one dance.
- Danny, what's going on?

817
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:58,870
- Just sit down here.
- No, don't leave me.

818
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:02,230
I better dance. It's the mazurka.
The woman asked, I can't refuse.

819
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:04,590
- Come on, baby.
- I'll be back in one dance.

820
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:06,350
We'll leave after this dance.

821
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:05,790
I saw you looking at me from across the room.

822
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,510
I'm blind.

823
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,470
I knew that was the reason.

824
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:23,350
You are a beautiful lady. What is your name?

825
00:50:23,470 --> 00:50:27,670
<i>Nina. I'm named after
a character in The Seagull.</i>

826
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:28,830
My name is Jesus.

827
00:50:28,950 --> 00:50:31,430
I was named after a bandleader in Panama City.

828
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:34,030
- You want to dance?
- No, thank you.

829
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:36,750
- I'm waiting for somebody.
- For me. I know. I'm here.

830
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:38,670
No. I can't dance.

831
00:50:39,590 --> 00:50:41,830
- Everybody can dance.
- I can't.

832
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,830
- Yes, you can.
- Nope.

833
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:46,470
When the music calls to him, Jesus listens.

834
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:48,950
It's all he can hear. Come on, I'll show you.

835
00:50:49,110 --> 00:50:50,630
It's easy.

836
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:50,190
- Let the music move you.
- I told you I was no good.

837
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:52,590
Who told you that? You're a great dancer.

838
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:55,150
- I am?
- Yeah, you are.

839
00:51:55,630 --> 00:51:57,030
See? Look. You're a natural.

840
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,910
- I am not.
- Yes, you are.

841
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:02,070
Really? I don't dance very much.

842
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:05,510
A woman who does not dance does not live.

843
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:08,270
- Who said that?
- Me.

844
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:11,390
Thank you very much.

845
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:14,710
You're a beautiful woman
and a very strong dancer...

846
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:16,430
...but I've got to go.

847
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:33,510
- Nina. I was worried about you.
- Danny, this is Jesus.

848
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:35,830
- He's teaching me how to dance.
- Hi, I'm Danny...

849
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:37,150
Now I cut your throat.

850
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:38,510
Watch out!

851
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:45,270
- Danny, what's happening?
- Don't worry. I'll take care of you.

852
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,070
He cut me!

853
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,590
- I'm gonna take you home.
- No, thank you.

854
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,030
My sister is coming for me.

855
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:02,150
As soon as Danny comes,
I'll take you both home.

856
00:53:02,270 --> 00:53:05,550
- No. I'll wait for my sister.
- Nina, are you okay?

857
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:08,150
- Yes, I'm fine.
- But you've got blood on you.

858
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:10,710
Blood's not a big deal.
Look, this is what you do, okay?

859
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:12,230
You take it, soak it overnight...

860
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:14,990
...soda water, vinegar, a touch of lemon,
comes right out.

861
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:16,230
My name is Jesus.

862
00:53:16,350 --> 00:53:17,430
My uncle's in dry cleaning.

863
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:19,630
- This is Anna, my sister.
- Where's Danny?

864
00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:20,830
- He got stabbed.
- What?

865
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,070
Hi, Anna.

866
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:24,030
Here. I think this has sugar in it.

867
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:25,790
- You met Jesus?
- He saved my life.

868
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:29,030
- Thank you. I'm taking Nina home.
- No, I can take her. I got wheels.

869
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:31,830
- Thank you, but no.
- I think Nina wants to go home with Jesus.

870
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,710
Will you stay out of this? Come on, Nina.

871
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:35,110
He offered to drive her home.

872
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:37,550
- She's going with me.
- Excuse me.

873
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:40,710
Will you please stop talking about me
like I'm not here?

874
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,710
I am perfectly capable of deciding for myself...

875
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,710
...who I'm going to go with.

876
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:51,830
Jesus is taking me home.

877
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:05,110
I need a lift.

878
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:11,750
God, I just can't believe you brought her there.

879
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:15,630
The truth of the matter is, Nina had a great time,
and you just hate that.

880
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,110
No. Nina was almost killed.

881
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:21,630
I was almost killed! Look! Nina was fine.

882
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:24,950
I have enough responsibility
trying to keep this family functioning...

883
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:26,230
...without you gumming it up.

884
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:29,670
Why are you responsible
for everyone in your family?

885
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:31,350
Because I am. All right?

886
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:34,190
They treat you like a valet service,
you know that?

887
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:36,030
You know what? That's life.

888
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:38,710
Some people take responsibility,
and others don't.

889
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,110
Thanks to you,
we've got Nina cruising the barrio...

890
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,470
...at night with a dishwasher named Jesus.

891
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:46,230
Yes, she is, and she's probably having fun...

892
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,110
...for the first time in her life.

893
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:52,310
Wait a second.
She's had fun before. Nina's had fun.

894
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:55,430
Nina's had fun before. When was that?
Tell me, when was that?

895
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:59,070
Maybe listening to your father rant on
about how love is a conspiracy.

896
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:00,590
I know.

897
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:03,830
Perhaps taking a page
out of Billy and Irene's guide to marriage.

898
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:08,350
Or feeling the passion that you and Eric ooze.

899
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:13,030
Wait a second. Eric and I have passion.
We have passion.

900
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:17,790
- What kind of passion is that? Tell me.
- Here we go again.

901
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:20,310
How many times have we seen this one before?

902
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,790
The cowboy, the working-class lug.

903
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:26,670
The stranger rides into town
and teaches the repressed little puritan girl...

904
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,110
...how to open up.

905
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:32,870
That is so patronizing,
not to mention clichd and inaccurate.

906
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:36,030
- Is it?
- For your information, I've been in love.

907
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:37,590
I am in love.

908
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:40,910
God.

909
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:42,630
Why do I always feel like...

910
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,590
...I have to prove something to you all the time?

911
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:48,790
I have more passion in me
than you'd know what to do with.

912
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:50,190
I doubt it.

913
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:59,510
You're attracted to me, aren't you?

914
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:02,670
Admit it.

915
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:08,150
Want to know something?
Yes. God help me, I am.

916
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:12,470
But I'm only attracted to you
because of your attraction to me.

917
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,270
- Is that bad?
- It's ludicrous.

918
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:17,110
It's a house of cards.

919
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:20,110
So I have no hope?

920
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:24,110
No, you have no hope whatsoever.

921
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:34,030
I mean, we had an interesting experience
25 years ago...

922
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,390
...and we crossed paths again.

923
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,270
- That's fate.
- Fate?

924
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:38,350
Yes.

925
00:56:38,710 --> 00:56:39,630
Fate.

926
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:42,470
Please, the last refuge of the truly desperate.

927
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:47,830
All right.

928
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,590
All right. Let's have it your way.

929
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:54,750
Fate rules our lives.
Fate caused us to be together now.

930
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:59,710
You think it's our fate to be lovers,
and I think it's our fate to be apart.

931
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,270
Let's see. Right now.

932
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:05,390
That's endearing.

933
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:08,990
You want to toss a coin
to see if we become lovers.

934
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:11,510
I forget. Did Romeo and Juliet do that...

935
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,790
...or did they just flip baseball cards?

936
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:16,390
- Are you backing out?
- I'm not backing out.

937
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:18,870
All right, then. Heads, we become lovers.

938
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:21,870
Tails, I'll go away. You'll never see me again.

939
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:23,670
You can blame it on fate.

940
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:26,390
I don't have to blame what I decide on anything.

941
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:30,230
So put your sentimentality to the test
and toss the damn thing.

942
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:34,270
- But I read the coin.
- You can read the coin.

943
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:37,950
Toss it over here by me.

944
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:42,070
You ready?

945
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,670
Toss it.

946
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,150
So...

947
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,030
What is it?

948
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:26,070
- It's tails.
- Right. Seriously, what is it?

949
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:28,470
It's tails.

950
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:33,590
You sure?

951
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:41,430
Don't you think I know the difference
between heads and tails?

952
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:43,950
Fate.

953
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,550
<i>"She looked enchanting in her black dress.</i>

954
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:57,510
"Her neck was enchanting.

955
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:59,990
"Her hair was enchanting.

956
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,230
"Her visage was enchanting. "

957
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:04,430
This chick was pretty enchanting.

958
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,070
Apparently.

959
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:11,150
- Nina, can I ask you a question?
- I've been blind since I was 10 months old.

960
00:59:12,030 --> 00:59:14,230
- No, I wasn't gonna ask you that.
- Yes, you were.

961
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:17,470
No, I was gonna ask you
if you were seeing somebody.

962
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:19,150
No.

963
00:59:19,270 --> 00:59:21,230
No, I'm not seeing anybody.

964
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:25,230
Stupid Jesus.

965
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,310
- No, you're not.
- I am. I shouldn't have...

966
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:28,910
No, I was just making a joke.

967
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:31,470
You know what I meant.
Are you going out with somebody?

968
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:32,510
No.

969
00:59:37,790 --> 00:59:40,030
- What?
- Take me home.

970
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:42,390
- Why? I'm sorry.
- I want to go home. Take me home.

971
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:44,790
I didn't mean that. I'm...

972
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,190
Wait!

973
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:13,430
- How are you?
- Fine.

974
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:17,150
I'm waiting for Anna.
I want to get her a gift before she gets here.

975
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:18,510
What's that book there?

976
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:21,270
<i>- Shaw's Man and Superman.
- Yeah, I've read that.</i>

977
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:24,270
- Half of it.
- Which half?

978
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:25,790
<i>Superman.</i>

979
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:29,070
Listen...

980
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:32,270
Seriously, I have to talk to you.

981
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:35,510
Something you should know.
Nothing to worry about.

982
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:38,270
I'm in love with Anna.

983
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:39,590
Are you?

984
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:42,990
I have it all in perspective now.
It's not a problem.

985
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:46,510
- And I just wanted you to know.
- I'll sleep much better knowing that.

986
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:49,430
What a thing to say.
I guess you hear it all the time, right?

987
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,830
"I'm in love with Anna. I love your girlfriend. "

988
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:54,150
What's it called? An occupational hazard.

989
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:57,630
- You know, I should look into insurance.
- No, that's it.

990
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:00,870
You don't need to. You got it made.

991
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:02,390
- She loves you.
- Does she?

992
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:04,270
Yes. Absolutely. She's crazy about you.

993
01:01:04,350 --> 01:01:05,750
What a relief.

994
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,230
- I love the way you do that.
- Do what?

995
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:11,510
You say as few words as possible.

996
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:14,510
It's very effective. Like a sharpshooter.

997
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:17,230
I'm a bit more like a shotgun, you know?

998
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:22,230
Scatter words like birdshot
hoping something is gonna hit.

999
01:01:22,310 --> 01:01:26,030
But you can take aim, and bang!

1000
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:27,430
Hit.

1001
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:29,590
It's very effective. An intellectual thing.

1002
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:33,030
- Perhaps I could tutor you.
- See, that's what I mean.

1003
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:35,510
That's what I mean. "Perhaps I could tutor you. "

1004
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,390
Sounds like a nice thing to say,
but underneath, bang!

1005
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:39,630
Watch out.

1006
01:01:39,870 --> 01:01:42,150
It's great. I like it. You gonna get that for Anna?

1007
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:43,870
- Yeah.
- A book?

1008
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:48,110
Why, I believe that's what they're called.

1009
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,430
You're outdoing yourself today.

1010
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:03,870
- A word of advice. Don't get her the book.
- She wants a book.

1011
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,910
No, she does not want the book.

1012
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:06,950
- She doesn't?
- No.

1013
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:10,230
No woman really wants a book for a present.
I promise you.

1014
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:11,990
What are you saying?

1015
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:15,830
All right. Give her the hat.

1016
01:02:17,750 --> 01:02:18,830
A hat?

1017
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:23,350
- I believe that's what they're called.
- She has a dozen hats.

1018
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:25,550
A woman can never have too many hats.

1019
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:29,790
I don't understand.

1020
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:33,670
I know.

1021
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:36,870
Get her the hat.

1022
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:39,430
I'll see you.

1023
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:52,430
Everybody, I want you to see...

1024
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:55,470
...the most beautifulest girl
in the whole wide world!

1025
01:02:57,510 --> 01:03:00,870
- She's beautiful, right?
- Nice to meet you.

1026
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:11,110
No telling Pop I was here.

1027
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:26,390
That rate looks a little low to me. Do you think?

1028
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,470
No, it's fine.

1029
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:35,350
- She's not lucid.
- I'm used to it.

1030
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:41,350
No, Mother, it's not Nina.

1031
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:43,910
I'm worried about Anna.

1032
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:51,430
Yes, Mother.

1033
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:54,030
I'm here. It's me, Nina.

1034
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:56,590
What worries you about Anna?

1035
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:59,070
I remember the moment you all began.

1036
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:03,150
Not your births, your conceptions.

1037
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:09,070
I knew you were conceived
the very moment your father...

1038
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:11,990
...you know, what do you call it?

1039
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:17,550
- Ejaculated?
- Not ejaculated.

1040
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,510
The other word they use for it now.

1041
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:23,790
- Came.
- Yes, came!

1042
01:04:24,270 --> 01:04:27,150
- Thank you, nurse.
- It's so biblical.

1043
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:31,350
Abraham came. Moses came.

1044
01:04:33,830 --> 01:04:37,670
I knew the very moment you were conceived.

1045
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,830
Mother, what about Anna?

1046
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:42,710
- What?
- What were you saying about Anna?

1047
01:04:42,830 --> 01:04:45,190
You said you were worried about Anna.

1048
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:49,390
- She's not youthful.
- What do you mean, she's not youthful?

1049
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:53,750
She came into the world
in such an extraordinary way.

1050
01:04:55,470 --> 01:04:59,670
I think I made her use up all her magic
in the way that she came into it.

1051
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:04,150
And now I'm afraid she has no magic left.

1052
01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:11,470
What do you want her to do?

1053
01:05:12,190 --> 01:05:15,110
- Before I die...
- You're not going to die.

1054
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:16,630
Before I die...

1055
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:20,630
...I want her to do something extraordinary.

1056
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:26,510
Would you tell her that for me please, Nina?

1057
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:30,070
I'll tell her.

1058
01:05:57,470 --> 01:05:59,470
- Don't worry about it.
- We're going outside.

1059
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:03,630
Okay! One, two, okay, stop.
We're gonna... It's a surprise.

1060
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,910
- Where are you taking me?
- Don't worry about it.

1061
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:06,990
Are we almost there?

1062
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:09,590
- Stop asking so many questions.
- How much further?

1063
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:11,630
Okay. What?

1064
01:06:12,550 --> 01:06:14,230
- What is it?
- Feel it!

1065
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:17,030
It's a bike.

1066
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:20,550
- It's a bicycle?
- Yeah, a bike, a bicycle.

1067
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:23,550
- You got me a bicycle?
- Yeah, look! It's cool.

1068
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:25,910
It's got a basket. I had them put this on.

1069
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:30,070
It's got mushroom grips, it's got a bell.
It's the coolest one they had, Nina.

1070
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:31,630
Is this a joke?

1071
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:34,150
What do you mean, a joke?

1072
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:37,110
- Why are you doing this?
- Doing what?

1073
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:41,190
- What am I gonna do with a bicycle?
- You're gonna ride it, sweetheart.

1074
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:44,910
- Are you crazy?
- No! Please stop.

1075
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:48,310
It's not a big deal.
When I was working yesterday, I got this idea.

1076
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:50,830
- I can't ride a bicycle.
- Yes, you can!

1077
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:53,590
- God. Anna was right.
- About what?

1078
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:54,950
She was right about everything!

1079
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:57,270
- About the bicycle?
- It's not about the bicycle!

1080
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,310
You don't understand! It's just...

1081
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,070
God, how could I be so stupid?

1082
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,630
- What? You're not stupid.
- The whole thing is stupid!

1083
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:06,070
It's a stupid mistake. Leave me alone!

1084
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:07,870
It's not a mistake, okay?

1085
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:10,070
It's not!

1086
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:20,150
We're not a mistake.

1087
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:28,270
- Mother, the doctor said you should stay in bed.
- What kind of car does he drive?

1088
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:30,350
I don't know. It's too cold.

1089
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:36,670
My God!

1090
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:38,070
Polo!

1091
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:40,110
Marco.

1092
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:42,350
Polo.

1093
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:44,310
They're here.

1094
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:50,950
Ready? One, two, three! Turn!

1095
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:54,350
Uphill! Uphill!

1096
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:56,990
What is she doing?

1097
01:07:57,630 --> 01:07:59,910
Slow, slow, slow.

1098
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:04,750
Are you ready? Can you get off?

1099
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:06,030
Yeah.

1100
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:10,910
- Aunt Nina, you're riding a bike!
- Did you see it?

1101
01:08:11,030 --> 01:08:15,190
It was the most amazing feeling.
It was like I was flying.

1102
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:19,270
- The wind was blowing in my hair.
- That's wonderful, darling!

1103
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:21,630
- That can't be safe.
- It's perfectly safe.

1104
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:24,110
We put playing cards in the spokes
so I could hear...

1105
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:25,990
...and then I just follow the sound.

1106
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:28,790
This is Jesus, everybody.

1107
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:29,790
Hi.

1108
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:32,230
Hello.

1109
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,270
They're his cards.

1110
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:53,590
- I like your family.
- They like you, too.

1111
01:08:53,710 --> 01:08:56,310
- Except for your sister.
- Who, Karen?

1112
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:58,230
No, Karen hates everybody.

1113
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:01,990
- But Anna, she's a cold one.
- No, Anna's okay.

1114
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:05,150
She just acts like an old lady sometimes,
that's all.

1115
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:06,990
What? What are you doing?

1116
01:09:07,190 --> 01:09:09,950
- Tying a scarf around my eyes.
- What for?

1117
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:12,630
- I want to try something.
- What?

1118
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:15,550
- I want to be blind, like you.
- Don't be stupid!

1119
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:17,190
I'm not. I wanna see what it's like.

1120
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:19,350
- You can't.
- Yes, I can.

1121
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:21,830
At work,
I close my eyes and do all kinds of things.

1122
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:24,270
- It's not the same thing.
- I'm ready.

1123
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:26,150
Okay, how do you do this?

1124
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:29,430
All right, stand still.

1125
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:31,830
- Okay.
- Stand very still.

1126
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:35,350
Now walk slowly towards the sound of my voice.

1127
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:38,270
Take your time.
Hold on, there's something in front of you.

1128
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:41,190
- How do you know that?
- Because I put it there.

1129
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:44,190
Okay, there's nothing between us now.

1130
01:09:44,790 --> 01:09:49,070
Keep going, keep going... Hello.

1131
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:46,470
The most passionate thing in my life
happened to someone else.

1132
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:13,390
All right!

1133
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,270
Yeah, I'm coming.

1134
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:32,110
Heads.

1135
01:11:33,470 --> 01:11:34,870
It was heads.

1136
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:37,070
I know.

1137
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:35,590
How old is she?

1138
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:37,630
No, I don't want to know that. Forget it.

1139
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:41,070
Forget I asked that.
She's blonde, though, right?

1140
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:42,150
God.

1141
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:44,430
What I want to know is,
are you sleeping with her?

1142
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:47,390
- Am I sleeping with who?
- Tell me the truth!

1143
01:12:47,510 --> 01:12:49,510
Honey, I'm telling you the truth. Put it down.

1144
01:12:49,590 --> 01:12:50,910
We both know it's not loaded.

1145
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:52,870
Jesus Christ!

1146
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:54,390
Mommy!

1147
01:12:55,550 --> 01:12:57,270
It's okay, honey!

1148
01:12:58,590 --> 01:13:02,710
Mommy's just explaining something
to your father.

1149
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:05,990
- Go back to sleep.
- You could've friggin' killed me.

1150
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:08,510
You want to know...

1151
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:09,950
Where did you get bullets for it?

1152
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:12,950
You want to know what is really amazing to me?

1153
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,790
How polite people are in gun stores.

1154
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:19,350
You know, you go in,
you pull into the parking lot...

1155
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:20,790
...and everybody just clears out!

1156
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:22,230
You know, they're so nice.

1157
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:24,510
One little space, and everybody points to it.

1158
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:26,990
They're like, "That's okay, you were here first.

1159
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:31,830
"Go on. No, you take it.
Really, it's yours, I insist. "

1160
01:13:32,510 --> 01:13:33,950
It's so nice.

1161
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:37,350
Sweetheart? Baby, put the gun down.

1162
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:40,190
- No, nope, not gonna.
- Put the gun down.

1163
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:43,310
I'm not gonna put it down,
because I need you to tell me the truth.

1164
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:47,030
I need you to tell me if you're sleeping with her.

1165
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:48,630
No.

1166
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:53,870
I don't believe you.

1167
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:57,230
- I don't believe...
- I swear to God!

1168
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:59,990
I am not sleeping
with any woman other than you.

1169
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:02,910
I'm not even sleeping with you, baby, so...

1170
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:06,870
Okay.

1171
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:13,470
I'm just gonna ask you once.

1172
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:16,790
One more time. Are you sleeping with her?

1173
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:23,030
Okay, yes. Yes, I am.

1174
01:14:43,190 --> 01:14:46,150
<i>I now pronounce you husband and wife.</i>

1175
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:48,710
You may kiss the bride.

1176
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,590
And then he said:

1177
01:15:10,630 --> 01:15:14,230
"I now pronounce you husband and wife. "

1178
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:17,430
And then the band began to play.

1179
01:15:18,230 --> 01:15:20,110
And we danced a little bit.

1180
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:23,990
I'm so jealous.

1181
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:29,510
I wanted to elope.

1182
01:15:31,350 --> 01:15:34,670
But your father insisted on
telling everybody first.

1183
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:39,790
That's just like Daddy. He's so romantic.

1184
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,070
Shouldn't we take her to the hospital?

1185
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:46,870
There's no point in that now.

1186
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:50,670
You want anything? Are you all right?

1187
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:53,510
I'm a little thirsty.

1188
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:00,950
She wants some vodka.

1189
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:06,390
- She can't drink that, Richard.
- Shut up.

1190
01:16:10,470 --> 01:16:12,310
Here you are, my darling.

1191
01:16:19,830 --> 01:16:21,390
My dark angel...

1192
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:25,190
...my little boy...

1193
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:31,150
...I know you love me.

1194
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:36,670
We are what we do, not what we say.

1195
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:49,910
To hell with you, my fine fool, Death.

1196
01:16:51,630 --> 01:16:55,470
I will not go meekly like an obedient child...

1197
01:16:55,630 --> 01:16:57,510
...or a quivering bride. No.

1198
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:03,790
He'll have to mount me
like an intractable whore...

1199
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:08,510
...and drag me, kicking and screaming...

1200
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:11,750
...the miserable son of a bitch.

1201
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:54,990
<i>Na zdorovie, my darling.</i>

1202
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:35,350
- I have to go.
- Why?

1203
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:38,910
Because I have to go to my mother's.

1204
01:18:39,070 --> 01:18:41,710
- I want to tell her.
- Can I come?

1205
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:43,750
No. No, not yet.

1206
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:49,030
- I don't want to leave you.
- Go on.

1207
01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:52,230
You have to go.

1208
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:54,910
I know.

1209
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:09,070
Stop kissing me, or I'll never leave.

1210
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,710
Will you wait for me?

1211
01:19:14,270 --> 01:19:15,310
Yeah.

1212
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:55,390
Just make sure that Jose
does that with the pool...

1213
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:57,470
...because he doesn't, you know.

1214
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:59,310
And I'll be back in three days.

1215
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:01,030
Okay.

1216
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:06,790
- Talk to you later.
- I called the house.

1217
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:09,230
I can't believe it.

1218
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:12,470
I'm so sorry.

1219
01:21:12,990 --> 01:21:14,230
Thank you.

1220
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:17,070
Are you all right?

1221
01:21:18,830 --> 01:21:21,430
My mother died last night,
and why wasn't I there?

1222
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:23,710
- That's not your fault.
- I know.

1223
01:21:24,510 --> 01:21:27,670
I know it isn't, but why do I feel like it is?

1224
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:29,870
And why do I...

1225
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:32,710
I feel like I'm being punished...

1226
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:35,470
...for not being somewhere
that I should have been.

1227
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:40,550
I feel so lost.

1228
01:21:42,710 --> 01:21:43,790
Hi.

1229
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:47,990
We should go, sweetheart.

1230
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:05,990
I gotta go.

1231
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:09,750
Of course.

1232
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:12,230
Of course you gotta go.

1233
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:55,350
You waited.

1234
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:59,190
You knew that was gonna happen, right?

1235
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:03,230
I didn't have a clue.

1236
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:06,870
I never do.

1237
01:23:07,670 --> 01:23:09,430
What are you gonna do?

1238
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:14,470
- I can't help thinking that this is my fault.
- It's not.

1239
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,630
No. I know, but I keep feeling,
what if I hadn't come here?

1240
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:20,590
- What if we hadn't...
- You think my mother would still be alive?

1241
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:21,630
No.

1242
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:24,950
She adored you.

1243
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:28,190
You were right, what you said.

1244
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:30,430
- What did I say?
- About passion.

1245
01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:32,710
About how we run into passion blindly.

1246
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:36,550
How we lose our perspective,
and, right in the middle of it, real life happens...

1247
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:38,190
...catches up and changes everything.

1248
01:24:38,270 --> 01:24:39,670
Yes, it does.

1249
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:43,110
- Everything comes crashing down.
- Like a stone.

1250
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:45,270
Yeah.

1251
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:47,790
I feel like a weight's been lifted off my back...

1252
01:24:47,910 --> 01:24:50,510
...'cause I hated feeling about you like that.

1253
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:51,870
Did you?

1254
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:55,990
Yeah. It made me feel foolish. Stupid.

1255
01:24:56,950 --> 01:25:00,630
Like someone else was inside me,
saying those things, doing them.

1256
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:03,310
- And like you said, it can't last, can it?
- No, it can't.

1257
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:05,590
- Doesn't...
- Doesn't, not at all.

1258
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:13,390
- I'm so sorry about your mother.
- Thank you.

1259
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:16,350
- Did you tell Eric?
- About us?

1260
01:25:16,630 --> 01:25:17,950
Yes, about us. What did he say?

1261
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:22,110
Yes, I did, and he said it's already forgotten.

1262
01:25:25,630 --> 01:25:27,190
See, that's great.

1263
01:25:27,350 --> 01:25:30,910
He can forget
something like that ever happened.

1264
01:25:31,030 --> 01:25:33,230
I wish I could be more like that.

1265
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:36,230
I wish I could be more controlled.

1266
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:38,270
I'll see you on Monday.

1267
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:53,270
I'm leaving in a couple of days.
Probably better like this.

1268
01:25:53,510 --> 01:25:54,950
Yes, much.

1269
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:59,710
I'm sorry if I messed anything up for you.

1270
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:02,750
- You didn't.
- You sure?

1271
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:11,750
Good-bye.

1272
01:26:54,230 --> 01:26:56,190
So, Irene, you saw Estelle?

1273
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:59,030
Yes. She seemed depressed to me,
at the funeral.

1274
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:02,550
Yes. She was upset. She seemed upset.

1275
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:05,110
Hold on a second, honey.
Eric has something to tell us.

1276
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:08,790
I was gonna say that Anna and I
are flying to Paris to get married.

1277
01:27:11,070 --> 01:27:14,230
- Paris! How romantic.
- That's wonderful.

1278
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:17,430
- Congratulations, you guys.
- I'm happy for you, darling.

1279
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:20,230
- Thanks, Dad.
- When are you guys heading out?

1280
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:23,030
- Sunday.
- Sunday? That soon?

1281
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:28,630
Does anybody want more coffee?

1282
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,150
I'll have some.

1283
01:28:10,990 --> 01:28:13,390
Why did you want to see me?
I have to go and pack.

1284
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:16,190
<i>Jesus finished reading Anna Karenina to me.</i>

1285
01:28:16,350 --> 01:28:19,670
- You didn't ask me here to tell me that.
- Mother was wrong.

1286
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:22,670
It's not a great love story.
It's a stupid love story.

1287
01:28:22,830 --> 01:28:24,070
- Is it?
- Yes.

1288
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:25,830
She throws herself under a train.

1289
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:26,870
I've read it.

1290
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:30,510
But even after she did it,
she realizes she made a mistake.

1291
01:28:30,710 --> 01:28:33,590
She tries to get out, but it's too late.

1292
01:28:33,870 --> 01:28:35,350
What's your point?

1293
01:28:35,470 --> 01:28:38,790
- Don't go to Paris.
- And what should I do instead?

1294
01:28:38,910 --> 01:28:41,630
- Find Danny. Go with him.
- You're being childish!

1295
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:44,470
I'm not being childish. You don't love Eric.

1296
01:28:44,990 --> 01:28:48,430
- Yes, I do, in my way.
- And what way is that?

1297
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:52,230
I can't explain it to you right now.
There are other things involved.

1298
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:56,110
- What things?
- Karen, Father, Billy, you.

1299
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:59,430
- Don't hide behind us, Anna.
- What do you mean, hide behind you?

1300
01:28:59,550 --> 01:29:01,110
We don't need you.

1301
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:02,870
You don't need me?

1302
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:07,470
How can you say that to me?

1303
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:10,190
My God!
I have nursed you all when you were sick!

1304
01:29:10,390 --> 01:29:12,910
I've given you money.
I've taken care of your children.

1305
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:14,550
I've lied for you!

1306
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:17,710
And you just stand there
and say you don't need me?

1307
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:19,310
Because we don't.

1308
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:22,710
Look, it's not the same. Everything's changed.

1309
01:29:22,830 --> 01:29:25,910
- What? What's changed?
- Everything. Everyone.

1310
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:31,190
Danny's love for you is so enormous,
it spilled over onto everyone else.

1311
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:33,670
He's changed you, too...

1312
01:29:34,270 --> 01:29:37,190
...only you're the last one to notice it.

1313
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:44,150
It's the mosaic Danny worked on.

1314
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:50,230
Jesus described it to me yesterday.

1315
01:30:00,110 --> 01:30:01,470
You love him.

1316
01:30:06,190 --> 01:30:07,870
Of course I love him.

1317
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:10,670
Of course I do.

1318
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:14,110
But I'm scared.

1319
01:30:20,230 --> 01:30:22,350
I've been scared my whole life.

1320
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:25,310
It's only now...

1321
01:30:26,150 --> 01:30:28,310
...that I'm in love, I'm not scared.

1322
01:31:03,830 --> 01:31:05,790
- Where did he say he was going?
- I don't know.

1323
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:07,870
- She took my Ring Ding.
- Did not!

1324
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:10,470
- Did you take his Ring Ding?
- Karen, please, think.

1325
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:14,510
Atlanta. He said there was work there.

1326
01:31:14,590 --> 01:31:17,830
- Did he say how he was getting there?
- The train, I think.

1327
01:31:17,950 --> 01:31:19,230
Thank you.

1328
01:31:21,710 --> 01:31:23,790
Listen, you don't want that.

1329
01:31:23,870 --> 01:31:25,270
The sugar's poison.

1330
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:29,390
You know, they injected a rat 20 times a day...

1331
01:31:29,470 --> 01:31:30,990
...for five years with this stuff.

1332
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:32,830
Do you know what it died of?

1333
01:31:58,510 --> 01:32:00,910
I need to find the train to Atlanta.

1334
01:32:38,270 --> 01:32:39,790
What are you doing here?

1335
01:32:39,870 --> 01:32:42,030
- You were right.
- What about?

1336
01:32:42,110 --> 01:32:44,510
About everything. About us. I was wrong.

1337
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:45,790
- No, you weren't.
- Yes, I was.

1338
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:47,390
No, you weren't.

1339
01:32:47,790 --> 01:32:50,350
Look, my train's leaving. I've gotta go.

1340
01:32:51,110 --> 01:32:53,190
- No. Listen.
- I'm really sorry.

1341
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:55,510
Listen. My mother was right.

1342
01:32:55,550 --> 01:32:58,830
She said it was my turn
to do something extraordinary and I'm doing it.

1343
01:32:58,910 --> 01:33:01,390
I'm here at a train station
in the middle of the night...

1344
01:33:01,510 --> 01:33:04,390
...like a character in a Russian novel,
and I'm begging you.

1345
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:07,350
- To do what?
- To take me with you.

1346
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:09,990
You don't know where I'm going.

1347
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:13,070
- I don't care!
- No. Listen to yourself.

1348
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:15,550
This is passion. Passion talking.

1349
01:33:15,790 --> 01:33:19,030
I know all about it. Believe me. And it feels fun.

1350
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:22,990
You do these stupid things like this.
But in the end, it doesn't work.

1351
01:33:23,190 --> 01:33:24,630
It won't last.

1352
01:33:25,790 --> 01:33:27,350
What have I done to you?

1353
01:33:28,310 --> 01:33:29,350
What?

1354
01:33:30,030 --> 01:33:31,830
You sound just like me.

1355
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:35,470
- Is that bad?
- Yes.

1356
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:37,830
It's terrible.

1357
01:33:40,150 --> 01:33:41,710
- I'm sorry.
- Wait.

1358
01:33:42,470 --> 01:33:45,630
We'll do it your way then. We'll let fate decide.

1359
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:51,990
Is that a real coin?

1360
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:54,990
Of course it's a real coin. Why wouldn't it be?

1361
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:56,550
No. No reason.

1362
01:33:56,790 --> 01:34:00,950
All right, heads, I go with you,
and tails, you can go away...

1363
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:03,470
...and I'll never bother you again. Deal?

1364
01:34:05,670 --> 01:34:07,510
All right, deal.

1365
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:11,830
- But I read the coin.
- All right. You read the coin.

1366
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:20,510
- Okay, you ready?
- Toss it.

1367
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:41,870
What is it?

1368
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:45,830
Aren't you gonna read it?

1369
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:50,110
It's heads.

1370
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:00,630
God, I love you.

1371
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:33,990
You did good, partner.

1372
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:37,550
Mom would have gotten a kick out of that.

1373
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:39,350
I'm gonna marry her.

1374
01:35:40,950 --> 01:35:43,990
Well, there's lot easier ways to meet a woman...

1375
01:35:44,230 --> 01:35:46,270
...especially for the woman.
