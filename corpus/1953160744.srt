Otherwise, you won't want
anything ever again.

So, how'd you learn music?

258
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,360
Mmm. My daddy.

259
00:19:55,444 --> 00:20:00,365
He had this old Washburn steel-string.

260
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,450
He couldn't play a lick on it.

261
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,494
I, you know, picked it up,
started fooling' with it.

262
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:07,789
- Guess that's how.
- Right. And what were you listening' to?

263
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,667

you probably never heard of.

Lulu Belle and Scotty, Emmett Miller.

265
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,173

266
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,969
Uh, no, I never heard the Georgia
Wildcats. Nah, I didn't figure you did.

267
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,138
How about Hank Williams?

268

00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,612
So, you said-

272
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:42,574
You feel like your music is also
influenced by the blues? Oh, yeah.

273
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,868
Son House, Big Bill Bronzy.

274
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,496
We all owe our existence
to them Delta boys.

275
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,790
You ever want to do anything else?

276
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,920
Play baseball.

277
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:59,090
I was pretty good, too,
you know, for a while there.

278
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,427
I couldn't hit the curveball.

279
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:06,181
Well, I just figured
I'd stick with the guitar, you know?

280
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,975
Son of a bitch stayed
where he was supposed to.

281
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:18,777
How about you?
You always want to be a writer?

282
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,740
I didn't know
what I wanted for a long time.

283
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,450
But now you do?

284
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,161
Well, now I know what
I don't want to do again.

285
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,789
Yeah. Amen.
{ Chuckles }

286

- You married?
- I was.

287
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,713
One of those things
you don't want to do again?

288
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,759
Not unless it's right. Yeah.
How the hell do you know?

289
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,220
Well, you tell me.
You've been married five times.

290
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,931
Jesus Christ. Four times.

291
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,558
Come on. Four times.

292
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,686
You going to make another album
with Tommy Sweet?

293
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,480
Two things I don't want to talk about-
multiple marriages and Tommy.

294
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,566
Right. What's your real name?

295
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:02,153
I'm Bad Blake.

296
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,948
I wasn't born Bad.

297
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,576
When I die, my tombstone
will have my real name on it.

298
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,788
Until then, I'm just going to stay Bad.

299
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:15,166
It's an awful long time
for people to have to wait to find out.

300
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,377
Mmm. Maybe, maybe not.

301
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,381
You a daddy? You got any kids?

302
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,389
Sweetie, I'm going to have
to start getting' going' here.

303
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:35,770
All right. Can you give me
just another half an hour after the show?

304
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,897
Well, let's see how it goes, huh?

305
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,569
I appreciate you having to do
your work. I understand that.

306
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:46,239
But let's just see how it goes.
Okay. All right. Thank you.

307
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,992
So, Wesley's,
uh, what, your cousin?

308
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,453
He's my uncle.
Oh.

309
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,830

310

- I have, uh, loved country music my whole life. Have you?

337
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:55,869
Yeah. I even know
the "B" sides of your albums.

Oh, that's better than me.

00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:06,087
I was thinking, if you weren't doing
anything after the show tonight,

340
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:10,717
we could get a late dinner...
or cup of coffee.

341
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:15,680
Well, I would, but I promised
a reporter an interview.

That's all right.

for another night.

344
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,481
Another time would be fine.

So, how did you-

357
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,824
You played a gospel
song in a bar. I did.

358
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,661
How'd you get away with that?
How'd you know?

359
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:22,163
If you'd been doing' it as long as I have,
you'd know those things.

Here you go. { Chuckles } All right.

What's your favourite?

364
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,553
Oh, I've have to say
"Falling and Flying. "

365
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:41,224
It made me a lot of money, that song.
Turned my whole life around.

366
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:45,603
- You get tired of playing it?
- When I have to play it twice, three times a night.

367
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:48,398
But, you know, it's been too good to me.

368
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,442
Can't turn my back on it.

369
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:56,447
So, in today's world
of artificial country music,

370
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,658
who's real country?

371
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04,163
What?
{ Chuckles }

372
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,750

373
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,794
Mmm! Hmm.

374
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,256
Is Tommy Sweet real
country? Tommy, oh, yeah.

375
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,217
He tries covering' it up.
I taught him country, you know?

376
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:20,388
He won't admit it. He's got to compete
with what's coming out of Nashville today.

377
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,098
But, yeah, he's real country.

378
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,810
How'd you meet him?
{ Exhales }

379

What do you want to talk about?

I want to talk about how bad
you make this room look.

I'm from Enid, Oklahoma.

Of course you are.

What's the most important thing
about you, Oklahoma?

390
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:14,942
I've got a son- Buddy.

He's four.

Could always use more.
Yeah, well-

Come to tomorrow night's show.
We can continue where we left off.

00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,537
Okay then.

Hey, Bad. I got great news for you.

402
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,060
Now, I'm busting' my ass on this.

403
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,687
So write it down.

00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,398
Cancel Benson, Arizona,
on your itinerary.

405
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:40,194
You're into Phoenix, Arizona,
Sun Pavilion. 8:00 sharp. How's that?

406
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,280
Pavilion?

407
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,783
Hey, I just called to tell you you're out
of the Red Bison Lounge...

408
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:48,953
and you're opening
a major show in Phoenix.

409
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,622
Opening?
Shit, I don't open-

410
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:56,252
Bad, cut the shit. Now, where else are you
going to play in front of 12,000 people?

411
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,881
- Open for who?
- You're opening for Tommy.

412
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:02,091
No, no. No. No goddamn way.

413
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:05,219
I haven't been able to convince him
about doing the record yet.

414
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,764
But at least I got him to agree to
this. No, I'm not going to do it, Jack.

415
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:12,226
I'm not going to open for Tommy.
I'll open for somebody else, but not Tommy.

416
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:15,438
Who else are you going to open for? You're going
to open for Madonna? You want me to call her?

417
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,566
The dream of every sideman
is that someday the front man,

418
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,235
whose ass he's been staring' at for years,
is going to open for him.

419

I don't owe Tommy Sweet that dream.
I don't owe him a fucking' thing.

We both know Tommy owes you big.

421

But we also both know
how much this is worth.

422
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:32,914
I'm going to call you back this
afternoon. There is no time, Bad.

423

Yes or no? I've got to have time
to think about this. Come on.

Am I going to actually get to go backstage
and meet Tommy and everything?

431
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:56,812

but I don't have time for this shit.

Oh, that's great, right?

499
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:06,413
That's what my agent says.

500
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,123
You going to come with me?
{ Clicks Tongue }

501
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,709
Hmm?

502
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,003
Will you?
You're kidding.

503
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:15,840
This is my serious look. Come on.

504
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,593
Bad.

505
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,930
I can't.

506
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,515
All right.

507
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,643
How about...

508
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,187
I come over this morning
and fix you and your boy...

509
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,815
some world-famous
Bad Blake biscuits, huh?

510
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,942
What do you say?

511
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,571
All right.

512
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:41,657
Now you just hold that right there.

513
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,827
There. Now let me see
your other finger.

514
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,288
Hold it like that. Can you do that?

515
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:49,790
Mm-hmm. You right-handed
or left-handed?

516
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,668
Oh, that one?
{ Sputtering }

517
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:56,755
Okay. Put that there like that.

518
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,675
And cock this finger.
Here's your trigger finger.

519
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,136
About like that.

520
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,972
Wait. Now here's
the most important part.

521
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,310
Take a bite of that biscuit.

522
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,395
Yeah, that's it.

523
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:15,357
You feel that flour and that butter
coursing through your body, huh?

524
00:37:15,442 --> 00:37:17,651
Giving you a power
you never thought you had?

525
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,446
Uh-huh. Your shirt getting'
all tight with muscle?

526
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:25,159
Mm-hmm. Whole worlds have been
tamed by men who ate biscuits.

527
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,369
Now shoot.

528
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:31,248
- And he scores! - {
Shrieks } - Did you score?

529
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:33,208
That's how we get it done in Texas. Yes!

530
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,961
Gimme five! Ow! Ooh! Yeah!

531
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:41,884
That's a real nice boy
you got there. Thank you.

532
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:46,013
He's not around men much.
I worry about that sometimes.

533
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,182
What about his daddy?

534
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,060
{ Laughs }
Oh. I made a lot of mistakes.

535
00:37:51,144 --> 00:37:53,312
I'm just trying
not to make 'em twice.

536
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,481
Good boy- good mom.

537
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,610
Good biscuits.

538
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:10,955
All right.
Okay.

539
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,501
I'll see you after a while, huh?

540
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,630
You take care now.
So long.

Okay!

Damn good to meet you, Mr. Blake.
I'm Ralphie, Tommy's road manager.

559
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,307
Big fan. Big fan.
Got a big show tonight.

560
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:56,977
Hey, Bear. This is Bad Blake.
Hey, how you doing', man?

561
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,855
So what's your equipment
like? Fender Tremolux.

562
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,107
That's it?
That's it, pal.

563
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,235
Man, you got a preference
- Marshall, Peavey, Vox? I like my Fender.

564
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,362
You like your Fender.
Okay, no sweat.

565
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:09,323
We'll make it right into the P.A.

566
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:12,493
Where's your stuff?
'78 Suburban out back.

567
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:14,203
I'll take care of it.

568
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,039
You go on at 7:30.
You get 45 minutes. Stay on that.

569
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,208
You can't go more
than three minutes over.

570
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:21,126
Tommy's on at 9:00.
He's off at 11:00.

571
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:24,296
These are the Bum Steers-
your backup.

572
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,926
Ah. This is the big time, boys.

573
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:32,137
How you doing'? Bad.

00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:35,015
I'm looking' forward to playing'.

575
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,477
Let's drink some
of this booze, huh?
Let's do it, baby.

576
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,854
Two bars of "D" and then we hit
the top of the bridge.

577
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,731
Go on, count it off,
Johnny.
{ Drumsticks Strike }

No, no, no. Bear. Bear. Bear.

581
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:01,542
I need kick and snare.
Turn down the damn guitars.

582
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:03,961
You're drowning out
my lyrics.
The mix is good, man.

583
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,797
You can't hear
what I'm hearing out here.

584
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,092
Yeah, you'd be surprised.
Set it the way I tell ya and leave it.

585
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:13,637
The mix is just fine, man.
Trust me on this.

586
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:17,808
Bear, I'm an old man.
I get grumpy. Humour me.

587
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,103
Damn sound men.
They try to fuck up the opening act.

588
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,981
You know? It makes
the headliner sound that much better.

589
00:41:24,107 --> 00:41:27,067
That's their fucking' job.
You got another
half hour there, cowboy.

590
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:31,905
Hey there, partner.
We're going to be up on this stage
till we get the mix the way I want it.

591
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:35,701
You set the mix the way I want it,
or I'm going to be up here rehearsing
right through Tommy's set.

{ Exhales }

593
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,748
All right. Let's take it
from the top of the bridge.
Let's see how Bear does.

594
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,292

Well, well. Heard you might be here.

You son of a bitch.
Sit on down.

You always knew
the right thing to say.

How the hell are you, Bad?

607
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,879
I'm worse.
That's about right,
I reckon.

608
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,340
What, you give up
on the Southern Comfort, huh?

609
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:34,968
I still drink it on stage.
It's good for the throat.

610
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:38,013
Yeah, that's what they tell me.
Too damn sweet for me.

611
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:41,016
Hell, I never liked it either.
But when you're one of Bad's Boys,

612
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,185
you got to be able
to put away the whiskey.

613
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,395
I'm sorry. I-I hate to interrupt.

614
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,565
Can I get an autograph,
Tommy? Thanks.
Sure.

615
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:52,569
You're my favourite.
I-I got all your records.
Thank you.

616

But this is the, uh-
This is the autograph you need.

That's Bad Blake.

618
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:04,331
Taught me
everything I know.
Cool.

619
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,670
Great. Thanks.
I'll be at your show tonight.

620
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:13,340
I may even make it
to San Diego.
Appreciate your support.

621
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:17,928

about our tours together.

you agreed to do this, Bad.

we broke down on the desert
in West Texas?

for that goddamn wrecker.

Well-
Just you and me
and a case of warm beer.

633
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,714
Those were the days.
Yeah.

634

Isn’t remembering wonderful?

How's the tour going?
It's a grind.

636

Fifty dates
in two months.
Oh.

00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:08,729
How about yours?
I'm out for a month.
Six states.

Pickup bands?
Yeah.

639
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,066
That's a ball buster.

640
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,277
Hell, we should've gotten together earlier,
done the whole tour.

641

{ Coughing }
We tried that.

642

There was just too much going' on, Bad.

643
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,119
That damn movie shoot down in Mexico.

644
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:27,247
Jill was on my ass
all the time.
Yeah.

645
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,751
Would've been
a hell of a tour though.
Oh, yeah. Hell of a tour.

646
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,381
Aw, shit.
I'm sorry, Bad, it didn't work out.

647
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,926
I was trying' to keep
my marriage together.

648
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:42,888
Don't hold that
against me.
I got a career too.

649

I wanted to hold together.

Don't think I don't remember that.

653
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:57,152
But I got a life too.

00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,571
Well, well.

655
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,992
Those are the ugliest
goddamn boots
l've ever seen in my life.

Why won't you do it?
Hold up now.
I never said I wouldn't.

660

DMZ just doesn't think
it's the right thing to do. That's all.

00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:57,246
Must be those blue pills.
Think I can get a prescription
or two of those?

830
00:56:57,331 --> 00:57:00,166
No!

831
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,796
¶¶ Your heart's
on the loose ¶¶ 

832
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:14,305
¶¶ You roll them sevens
with nothing' to Lose ¶¶ 

833
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:26,692
¶¶ This isn’t no place
for the weary kind ¶¶ 

834
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,071
You know that song?

835
00:57:30,197 --> 00:57:33,241
Hmm?
Can't remember
who did it.

836
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,243
That's the way it is
with good ones.

837
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:38,246
You're sure you've heard 'em before.

838
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:40,373
You wrote that?

839
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,667
Yes, ma'am, just now.

840
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,880
This is so unfair.
What?

841
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:51,551
Some people give
1 0 years of their life to be able
to do something like that,

842
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:55,346
and it just- it just pours out of you.

843
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,143
You mad at me?

844
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:03,688
You want me to go
to a motel?
No.

845
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,733
What?

846
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,237
I don't want you to go.

847
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,656
Well, what then?
{ Sighs }

848
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:18,411
Well, you're writing' a song on my bed.

849
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,748
So?
So...

850
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:27,003
every time I lie down,
I'm going to hear
that beautiful goddamn song,

851
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,588
and-

852
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:34,427
And you're going to be out there...

853
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:38,681
running' around,
not even remembering' this day...

854
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:41,684
that I can't even forget.
lf I could walk,
I'd come to you.

855
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,729
Sweetie, come here.
{ Sighs }

856
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:47,315
Come here. Listen to me.

857
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,734
When I was at the hospital,

858
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:53,696
I thought about
who to call.
{ Sniffles }

859
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:57,491
Who really gives
a damn about me?

860
00:58:57,576 --> 00:59:02,246
And then, I thought about
who I wanted to see. { Chuckles }

861
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:06,542
You hear me? Huh?
{ Sobbing }

862
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:09,629
I'm not going to forget about you.

863
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:12,465
I'm not going to forget about this day.

864
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,303
I promise you.

865
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:23,768
{ Exhales }
Look at you.

866
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:28,981
{ Jack } What the hell
are you doing' back in Santa Fe?
You're not supposed to be there.

867
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:32,526
- I'm visiting a friend.
- Well, can you drive yet?

868
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:35,363
Pretty soon.
All right. I want you
to get back out there...

869
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:37,823
as soon as possible.
Jesus Christ.

870
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:41,244
If you found out your sister was turning'
five-dollar tricks, you'd overbook her.

871
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,996
Very, very funny.
Remind me to book you
into some comedy clubs.

872
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,165
Just so you know, I have a contract here...

873
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,376
offering you $75,000.

874
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:52,004
An advance for an album
to be recorded at a future date.
Why? Wait-Wait a minute.

875
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,173
What offer?
Don't worry about
who, who, who, who.

876
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:59,553
Plus, another $20,000 for first refusal
rights for all songs to be written...

877
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:02,890
or co written by you
over the next two years.
What-What-

878
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:06,686
- Holy shit.
- This is going to be your best year
in the Last seven.

879
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,897
And you know who's responsible?
Tommy Sweet.

880
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:13,276
So do me a favour.
Ease up on him, will you, pal?

881
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,653
Tommy?
Yeah, Tommy.

882
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,531
Yeah, you got me.
All right, I'm going to
talk to you in Houston.

883
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,574
And don't marry your friend.

884
01:00:20,659 --> 01:00:25,204
I'm-I'm not getting' married.

{ Line Clicks }
Bullshit.

886
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:32,420
You want to call him back and tell him
I'm not about to marry you?

887
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:36,799
You might want to wait
till I ask before you turn me down.

888
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:42,513
I'm going to sleep on the foldout.
it'd be too confusing for Buddy.

889
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:45,057
No, I'll do that.
No, no.
No, no. You need a bed.

890
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:48,936
It's all right. I want to.
I'm going to go get him.

891
01:00:49,021 --> 01:00:51,731
He really wants to draw on your cast.

892
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:54,817
Will you do
something for me?
You name it.

893
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,737
Don't drink in front of him.

894
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:03,034
No problem. Here.

It's like another world.

Take that.
This domestic deal- pretty darn intense.

He's really like that? Hmm?
What are you talking about?

912
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:14,230
You've been married
a whole bunch.
Yeah.

But I, you know-
I didn't, uh-

914
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:23,948
I got a 28-year-old son, Jeannie.

915
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:29,120
I haven't seen him since
he was four years old.

Where is he?
I don't know.

917
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:38,045
His mother, Mary Jo,
lives in Mafa, Texas.

I don't know what he looks like.

I don't know what he does.

920
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:50,433
Never taught him how to ride a bike or
watched him play baseball. None of that.

921
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:53,144
Why not?

922
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:59,984
I don't know.
I wasn't there, even when I was.

923
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:06,657
I couldn't live if I lost Buddy.

01:07:40,557 --> 01:07:43,600
That's rust. Metal-fIake rust.

993
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:48,355
I want y'all to come to Houston.

994
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,899
Would you do that? Huh?
Throw those in there.

995
01:07:50,984 --> 01:07:54,153
I'm going to be there
for four months.

996
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:56,530
Nights only, so I got my days off.

997
01:07:56,614 --> 01:08:00,409
Well, I took some time off for your visit,
so I don't know if I can do it again.

998
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:03,162
You can take Buddy down there.
All kinds of great stuff to do in Houston.

999
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:06,331
All right. We'll see.
They got that aquarium
with a big fountain down there.

1000
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:09,376
All right, we'll see.

1001
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:11,879
"We'll see." That means no.

1002
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:15,048

1004

Well, I don't want it around Buddy.
That much I know.

1010
01:08:41,326 --> 01:08:44,620

a ways from here, isn’t it?
- 879 miles.

01:19:18,129 --> 01:19:20,547
That song by Billy Joe Shaver.

1153
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:23,675
I'm going to live forever. I'm going to cross
that river when I catch tomorrow now.

1154
01:19:23,801 --> 01:19:28,263
Oh, yeah.
Goes something' like-

1155
01:19:28,347 --> 01:19:32,559
¶¶ Nobody here will ever find me ¶¶ 

1156
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:34,727
¶¶ I'll always be around ¶¶ 

1157
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:38,565
¶¶ Just like the songs
I leave behind me ¶¶ 

1158
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:42,402
¶¶ I'm going to live forever now ¶¶ 
Listen to this now.

1159
01:19:42,486 --> 01:19:44,946
¶¶ You fathers and you mothers
Be good to one another ¶¶ 

1160
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:47,282
¶¶ Please try to raise
your children right ¶¶ 

1161
01:19:47,366 --> 01:19:49,409
¶¶ Don't let
the darkness take 'em ¶¶ 

1162
01:19:49,493 --> 01:19:51,453
¶¶ Don't make 'em feel
forsaken ¶¶ 

1163
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:54,664
¶¶ Just lead 'em
safely to the light ¶¶

1165
01:20:02,256 --> 01:20:03,923
Hello?
Hi.

1166
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:06,801
Hey!
You all right?

1167
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:10,597
- Yeah, I'm fine. Why?
- You didn't sound like
you were all right yesterday.

1168
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:12,849
You sounded like
you were dying a slow death.

1169
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:17,770
Oh. Think it must've- I don't know-
been food poisoning or something.

1170
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:22,025
Well, I'm calling because
I got four days off at the end of this month,

1171
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:24,235
and I thought we might come.

1172
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:28,615
Oh.
But I'm not sure it'd be
such a good idea.

1173
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:32,035
What are you talking about?
It's a great idea. Why would you say that?

1174
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:34,412
You sure you're okay?

1175
01:20:34,497 --> 01:20:36,581
I'm worried about you.

1176
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:39,125
Don't waste a minute worrying about me.

1177
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:42,754
There's nothing' wrong
that a visit wouldn't cure.
How's Buddy boy doing'?

1178
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,881
He's fine.

1179
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:48,551
So, you going to come?

1180
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:02,690
{ Jean }
Can you reach it?

1181
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:07,529
Hey, there. Oh, you got your car!
Go through the tunnel there.

1182
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,245
{ Bad }
Well, I think he's had it.

1183
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:19,582
You all right, Bud?
He's eating'-
He's eating' in his sleep.

1184
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:45,149
{ Bad } What do you think of these
big buildings, huh, Bud?

1185
01:21:45,234 --> 01:21:48,027
I bet Superman couldn't even
leap over these things.

1186
01:21:48,112 --> 01:21:51,573
Right here in this town...

1187
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:55,910
is where Sam Houston and his boys
beat Santa Ana and his Mexicans.

1188
01:21:55,995 --> 01:21:59,414
Wasn't for this spot,

1189
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,541
we'd all be speaking' Mexican.

1190
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:06,921
That's where Texas
got its star, right there.
You speak any Mexican, Bud?

1191
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:10,592
{ Speaking Spanish }
Hey, that's pretty good.

Wow, Bud.
Where's that big turtle?

1194
01:22:15,306 --> 01:22:17,974
What do you see there?
Where'd he go?

1195
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:22,103
I think there's
a lobster that was in here.

1196
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:24,230
You getting' tired?
Oh.

1197
01:22:24,315 --> 01:22:28,359
He's got so much energy,
he wears me out sometimes.

1198
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:31,112
Why don't you go back to that park?
Take a Load off.

1199
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:35,700
Let Bud and I fool around, and we'll come
back around noon and take you out to lunch.

Here.

1204
01:22:48,672 --> 01:22:51,257
Pick one. Pick some.
You can have a bunch.

1205
01:22:51,342 --> 01:22:54,927
There you go. That's good.

1206

{ Laughs, Coughs }
Here's mine.

1207
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:02,727

That's it.

01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,937
Hey.

1209
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:08,941
Bud? You want to go inside
where it's cool?

1210
01:23:09,026 --> 01:23:11,277
Huh? Let's do that.

1211
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:13,404
Come on.

1212

Hey, sailor,

and wet our whistle before it pop
out of the ground, huh?

1215
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:25,792
Out of the ground?
Like that guy on TV?

1216
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:29,128
What guy?
On TV.

1217
01:23:29,213 --> 01:23:32,674

All right.
Take a load off there, Bud.
