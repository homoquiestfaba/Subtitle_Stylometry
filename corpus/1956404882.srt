Hi.

31
00:01:51,993 --> 00:01:53,279
Okay, I have another race.

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,633
Let's see who can clean
their room first, let's go.

33
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,189
Stephen, honey don't leave your bike

34
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,120
in the middle of the driveway,

35
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:01,873
you know how angry your dad gets.

36
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:03,823
Come on.

37
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,079
Ah, great.

38
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,729
Are you sure you don't
want the little one too?

39
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,549
No, I think this is
just gonna be perfect.

40
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,410
[Terri] What time do you need me?

41
00:02:16,411 --> 00:02:17,929
Is seven too early?

42
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:18,939
No.

43
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,119
This party is so important.

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,829
If everything isn't just right,

45
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,630
Robert's gonna scream bloody murder.

46
00:02:26,059 --> 00:02:28,153
The whole neighborhood
has heard him screaming.

47
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,020
I don't see how you take it.

48
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:33,749
Oh come on, you make it
sound worse than it is, really.

49
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,403
How bad does it have to get?

50
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:41,139
I'll see you at seven okay?

51
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,072

At 20%, at Dallas Fort Worth area.

56
00:03:11,464 --> 00:03:14,808
Thank you, excuse me.

(whistles)

58
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:18,759
Excuse me.

59
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,769
I know that our evening is
just getting started here

60
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,259
but it's getting late
for a couple of folks

61
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,979
and before she puts 'em to bed

62
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,130
I want you all to meet
my wonderful family.

63
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,099
First my beautiful wife Linda,

64
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,289
who put this whole
evening together for us.

65
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,707
(applauding)

66
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,329
And my wonderful children,

67
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:46,310
my boy Stephen, little girl Kathleen.

68
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:49,256
(applauding)

69
00:03:49,257 --> 00:03:50,260
Say goodnight.

70
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:51,638
[Both] Goodnight.

71
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:52,776
[All] Goodnight.

72
00:03:52,777 --> 00:03:54,133
Goodnight guys.

73
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,486
Alrighty, let's party
and let's talk business.

74
00:03:58,487 --> 00:03:59,955
[Crowd] Okay!

75
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:04,956
(chattering)
(mariachi music)

76
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,669
Okay that looks fabulous.

77
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,439
Oh and keep 'em away from
the guy with the red nose

78
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,231
I think he ate the whole last tray.

79
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:18,482
(laughing)

80
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:22,276
What the hell is wrong with you?

81
00:04:22,277 --> 00:04:24,789
Can't you keep these
kids where they belong?

82
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:25,720
Honey what are you doing outta bed?

83
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:27,102
I was just watching.

84
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:30,629
Yeah watching, you're annoying
the hell outta my guests.

85
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,463
Stephen you go upstairs

86
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:32,589
and I'll come and tuck you in in a few...

87
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,539
The hell you will!

88
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,433
He's too old for you to be tucking him in.

89
00:04:36,434 --> 00:04:37,569
It's my fault...

90
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,709
So you stop making excuses for him,

91
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,095
you're always doing that!

92
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:42,108
Oh, you're hurting me.

93
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:44,410
(slap echoes)
(woman cries out)

94
00:04:44,411 --> 00:04:45,940
You see?

95
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:47,941
See what you made me do?

96
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:50,966
Bob!

97
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:52,250
The guys...

98
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,709
I'll just tell 'em you're busy.

99
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,427
Yeah, keep 'em happy, I'll
be out in a few minutes.

100
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:00,729
Alright.

101
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,813
(crying)

102
00:05:03,773 --> 00:05:06,262
Upstairs, right now.

103
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:09,212
Oh please don't hurt Stephen.

104
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:10,867
- Huh?
- Don't be mean to him.

105
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:14,760
Are you saying it was your fault?

106
00:05:14,761 --> 00:05:15,594
- Huh?
- Please, please don't.

107
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:17,181
Should I blame you, Linda?

108
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:18,686
Huh?

109
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:20,364
- Don't!
- Is that what you're saying?

110
00:05:20,365 --> 00:05:21,198
Huh?

111
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,559
(suspenseful music)

112
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,479
Is that what you're saying, huh?

113
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,919
Come on, Linda.

114
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,646
Who's it gonna be?

115
00:05:27,647 --> 00:05:29,099
Who's at fault here, you, Stephen?

116
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:29,933
Come on!

117
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,345
It's my fault, it's my fault, okay!

118
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:33,513
It's my fault!

119
00:05:35,037 --> 00:05:37,195
(cries out)

120
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:38,029
That's it.

121
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:38,936
Don't hurt the children, please,

122
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:40,406
don't hurt the children.

123
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:43,474
Okay, don't hurt the children!

124
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:45,892
(whimpering)

125
00:05:48,606 --> 00:05:51,327
No!
(slap echoes)

126
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:54,078
(train whistles)

127
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,856
Lucky you were home.

128
00:06:10,857 --> 00:06:12,129
I could never have done this myself.

129
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,869
Oh it's pretty simple really.

130
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,069
You just take the owner's
manual out of the glove box,

131
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,999
you look up the part
about changing the tire

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,300
and you follow directions.

133
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:24,889
How come you didn't let
us know you were coming?

134
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,159
I did.

135
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,993
Nobody answered.

136
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,833
Maybe you didn't hear the phone.

137
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,553
Honey.

138
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,199
I didn't pay all that money
for these super gizmos

139
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,150
just so I wouldn't hear the phone ring.

140
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,392
Hey you kids wanna ride with me?

141
00:06:42,393 --> 00:06:43,280
[Both] Yeah!

142
00:06:43,281 --> 00:06:45,923
Well get in the motor home!

143
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,577
It's about Robert again, isn't it?

144
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,723
Yeah, you don't have to say anything.

145
00:07:05,203 --> 00:07:07,703
(owl hooting)

146
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,899
If you stay til Sunday, we
could use you in the choir.

147
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,013
Thanks, Mom.

148
00:07:25,014 --> 00:07:27,712
(mom chuckles)

149
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,299
So you gonna stay til Sunday?

150
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,833
I don't know, I haven't decided yet.

151
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:38,669
Well, the kids are asleep and your dad's

152
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,600
got his hearing aids out,
so if you wanna talk...

153
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:47,239
You remember when Stephen saw you

154
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,379
making your cake without frosting

155
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,229
and he called it yellow
bread the first time?

156
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,973
Honey, I remember when
Harry Truman was president.

157
00:07:58,848 --> 00:08:00,739
(pensive music)

158
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,873
It's about Robert.

159
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,270
You know how we feel about Robert.

160
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,400
I'm leaving him, Mom.

161
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,653
I'm filing for divorce.

162
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:15,520
Oh honey.

163
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:17,605
(woman gasps)

164
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:19,439
What?

165
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,273
What's wrong?

166
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,492
Oh god, bastard.

167
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,413
That bastard!

168
00:08:37,543 --> 00:08:40,103
How long have you been
keeping this from us?

169
00:08:44,572 --> 00:08:47,111
I was ashamed, Mom.

170
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:48,029
How long?

171
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,583
From the beginning.

172
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,923
Always.

173
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,947
I don't understand you, Linda.

174
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:11,099
It's bad enough that you
let him do this to you

175
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,943
but that you couldn't come to us?

176
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,280
I just thought I could make it better,

177
00:09:18,281 --> 00:09:21,281
I thought I could make it different.

178
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,680
But I didn't, it just got worse and...

179
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:29,717
And now I'm afraid.

180
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,503
I'm really afraid.

181
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:38,670
I'm afraid for me and
I'm afraid for the kids.

182
00:09:43,036 --> 00:09:45,119
(crying)

183
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,630
What did Robert say?

184
00:09:52,712 --> 00:09:54,712
(sighs)

185
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:00,740
Hi, I'm home.

186
00:10:00,741 --> 00:10:02,377
(door slams)

187
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:04,230
Linda?
(suspenseful music)

188
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:07,455
Where are you?

189
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:08,289
Hello?

190
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,959
Stephen, Kathleen!

191
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,553
If this is a joke, it's not funny anymore.

192
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,843
Where are you, where the hell is everyone?

193
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,195
(door clatters)

194
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:25,029
Linda!

195
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,688
(dramatic music)

196
00:10:59,082 --> 00:11:01,832
(glass shatters)

197
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,123
Linda!

198
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,749
Come on Linda, open the door please,

199
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,773
I wanna talk to you.

200
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,437
(doorbell ringing)

201
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,603
Linda!

202
00:11:58,453 --> 00:12:01,419
(door knocking)

203
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,253
Linda, come...

204
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,029
This isn't fair, at least talk to me!

205
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,480
I know the kids are in there.

206
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,583
Please let me in.

207
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:16,396
(doorbell ringing)

208
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,419
Thanks.

209
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,749
(door knocks)

210
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,699
Why don't you kids come
with me into the kitchen,

211
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,253
I'll fix you some nice lunch.

212
00:12:27,264 --> 00:12:31,181
(doorbell ringing incessantly)

213
00:12:34,728 --> 00:12:37,228
(Linda sighs)

214
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,293
Okay.

215
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,349
She may be your wife,
Robert, but this is my house.

216
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,109
And you're not welcome here.

217
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,573
Wait, hey, hey, hey, get...

218
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:05,827
(sighs)

219
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,419
Have you gotten yourself a lawyer yet?

220
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,879
I talked to one.

221
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,709
Well talk doesn't feed the bulldog.

222
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:16,723
Did you hire him?

223
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,949
Well I explained to him
that Robert has control

224
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,049
of all the money and he
said that in cases like that

225
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,783
then the husband usually
pays for the wife's attorney.

226
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:28,143
Hmm.

227
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:35,298
I didn't hear his car.

228
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,408
Did he leave?

229
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:41,497
(phone ringing)

230
00:13:41,498 --> 00:13:44,498
(suspenseful music)

231
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,363
Linda.

232
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,063
It's him.

233
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,999
Yes.

234
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,367
Don't do this to me, Linda.

235
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:18,149
You are my wife!

236
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,423
Now open that door.

237
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,193
I can't talk to you
when you're like this.

238
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,459
If you think you can
make a fool out of me

239
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,127
you've got another thing coming.

240
00:14:30,638 --> 00:14:32,471
You won't get nothing.

241
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:35,179
Absolutely nothing!

242
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,580
Do you hear me?

243
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:03,354
I don't understand, his hitting me,

244
00:15:03,355 --> 00:15:05,289
you didn't even bring it up.

245
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,149
Mrs. Edelman, we
haven't gone to trial yet.

246
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,819
This is just preliminary.

247
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,952
Why don't you just relax,
let me earn my money.

248
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:13,659
And let's be realistic here.

249
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,399
Robert's paying for his attorney

250
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,769
and he's paying my fees
for representing you so...

251
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,149
You told me that's how it was done.

252
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,529
This is crazy.

253
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,449
I have to move out of
my house for 10 days,

254
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,283
Robert moves in...

255
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:26,939
And in five days Robert
moves out, you move back in.

256
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,069
And according to the judge
I have to be out of my house

257
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,903
in three hours?

258
00:15:29,904 --> 00:15:31,409
The judge himself came
up with this approach.

259
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,419
You see this way the kids
sleep in their own beds, right?

260
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,779
And where do I sleep tonight?

261
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,549
Robert said you could
use that house on Pagewood.

262
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,155
The Pagewood house isn't even finished

263
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:41,772
and I don't have the keys!

264
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:44,403
Mrs. Edelman, I'm a
lawyer, not a locksmith.

265
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,292
Just talk to Robert.

266
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:48,126
Well...

267
00:15:48,126 --> 00:15:48,959
(car door clatters)

268
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:49,792
And what about Stephen and Kathleen?

269
00:15:49,793 --> 00:15:52,359
They expect me to come
home tonight, not move out.

270
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,439
Look, just give it a try.

271
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,908
We'll see how this works out.

272
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:57,139
Why don't you give me a call next week?

273
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,973
Fair enough?

274
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:00,300
Best I can do.

275
00:16:06,831 --> 00:16:08,509
[Kathleen] What time will you be back?

276
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,480
I explained that.

277
00:16:09,481 --> 00:16:12,599
I'm gonna move away for five
days and then I come back.

278
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,908
No, come back tonight.

279
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:17,634
Put that in the car
for me, would you Terri?

280
00:16:17,635 --> 00:16:20,633
If you loved us you wouldn't go away.

281
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,049
Stephen, Kathleen, come here.

282
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,633
Now look at me, both of you.

283
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,508
I'm not leaving you.

284
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:32,609
I'm not leaving you, okay?

285
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,960
You just don't want to
be our mother anymore.

286
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:38,589
Stephen honey this is
just for a couple of days.

287
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,059
Your dad'll be here,
Terri'll be right next door,

288
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,873
I'll call you tonight, Stephen!

289
00:16:44,739 --> 00:16:47,313
(door slams)

290
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:50,397
(car engine revving)

291
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,209
[Terri] You want me to
keep her in the house?

292
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,043
Mommy, where will you sleep?

293
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,319
Honey I'm just gonna
be at Grandma's, okay,

294
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,839
and I'll call you later.

295
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,779
You stay here with Terri.

296
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,780
I'll call you later.

297
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,039
It's your choice, Linda.

298
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,529
You can make this easy on yourself

299
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,253
or you can push me and see
just how ugly it's gonna get.

300
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:27,768
(suspenseful music)

301
00:17:27,769 --> 00:17:29,352
You'll get nothing.

302
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,803
Absolutely nothing.

303
00:17:42,206 --> 00:17:47,206
No house, no money, no kids.

304
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:14,463
You've got quite the collection here.

305
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,285
When we spoke on the phone,

306
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,529
you didn't have any accent, I
didn't realize that you were...

307
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,363
Asian?

308
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,663
I was born in Ohio.

309
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,229
As a matter of fact it
wasn't until Vietnam

310
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,430
that I learned any of
the Eastern languages.

311
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,853
So, how did you hear about me?

312
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:39,973
Let's just say a satisfied
customer recommended you.

313
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,209
And?

314
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,719
My wife has filed.

315
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,009
We're getting a divorce and I'm afraid

316
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,859
it's starting to get ugly.

317
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,573
[James] Can you be more specific?

318
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,350
I'm a businessman.

319
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:54,899
I don't want my partners embarrassed

320
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,061
by having their investments mixed up with

321
00:18:58,062 --> 00:18:59,853
my marital problems.

322
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,739
So how can I help you?

323
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,349
Follow her.

324
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,224
I wanna know where she goes, who she sees,

325
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:11,173
how does she spend her money,
what does she spend it on.

326
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:13,683
Simple enough.

327
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,959
How often and where do
I mail you my reports?

328
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,793
No.

329
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,453
I only want verbal reports
and I'll pay you in cash.

330
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,709
I don't want receipts.

331
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,363
I don't want canceled checks.

332
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,959
I don't want invoices,
paperwork of any kind.

333
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,360
That's not a problem, is it?

334
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,776
As we said in the Green Berets,

335
00:19:35,777 --> 00:19:37,249
(suspenseful music)

336
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,960
anything is possible.

337
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:41,711
(lighter clicks)

338
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,543
Lock and load, rock and roll.

339
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,776
This is unbelievable.

340
00:19:59,777 --> 00:20:01,783
Didn't you read any of this?

341
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,133
Yes Dad, I read it.

342
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,713
I can't believe you're
letting him get away with this.

343
00:20:08,714 --> 00:20:11,039
I didn't let him get away with anything.

344
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,659
You signed an agreement giving Robert

345
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,609
complete control over the children's lives

346
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,199
and you say you're not letting
him get away with anything?

347
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,739
And I didn't come out
here to get dumped on

348
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,319
by my sister either.

349
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,253
Miriam's not dumping on you, Linda.

350
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,642
We just can't believe you'd sign this.

351
00:20:25,643 --> 00:20:27,003
I mean, why?

352
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,239
I signed it because
I thought it would end

353
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,589
all the anger and frustration.

354
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,969
Come on Linda.

355
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,639
You signed it because
you didn't have the guts

356
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,159
to look Robert in the eye and say no.

357
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,479
I signed it because my
attorney told me to sign it.

358
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,673
Your attorney, yeah.

359
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,069
Well Robert's paying the bills,

360
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:48,019
I don't see how you can call
this jerk your attorney.

361
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,233
Fine, fine, I give up.

362
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,729
Well I don't want you to give up!

363
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,009
That's what I don't want you to do!

364
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,979
I want you to pick your
shots a little better,

365
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,159
don't you understand?

366
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,049
I am not serving dinner
until you all stop yelling.

367
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,419
We're not yelling, Mother.

368
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,099
[Virginia] Oh yes you are.

369
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,949
Fine, we're all yelling, okay?

370
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,239
Everybody's yelling and
everybody's right but me.

371
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,133
Are you happy?

372
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,103
Then we're agreed.

373
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:15,729
You get a new lawyer.

374
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,919
Dad.

375
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,469
The good ones won't even shake your hand

376
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,739
or let you sit in their
office for less than $25,000.

377
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,333
I don't have $25,000, I
don't even have $2,500.

378
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,089
Look.

379
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,973
I told you that Robert was a bum.

380
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:35,029
I told you not to marry him!

381
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,430
But you didn't listen to me!

382
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,103
Alright.

383
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,659
Now I can't hear you.

384
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,843
You make the call and I'll get the money.

385
00:21:46,703 --> 00:21:47,653
Come on, let's eat.

386
00:21:48,946 --> 00:21:51,613
(pensive music)

387
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,517
You coming?

388
00:22:02,727 --> 00:22:03,644
Uh, yeah.

389
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,625
I'm sorry honey.

390
00:22:21,994 --> 00:22:23,739
[Linda] I hope I have
everything you asked for.

391
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,740
Did you bring those lists?

392
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,573
Yes.

393
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,899
Oh yeah, this is fine,
fine, this is what we need.

394
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,799
You know Robert built the houses

395
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,969
but I did all the decorating
and we both did the selling

396
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,469
and well then the kids came.

397
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,109
No, this is fine.

398
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,349
I just want to show that you
were part of the business

399
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,550
from the very beginning.

400
00:22:45,602 --> 00:22:46,435
Mr. Vandeneichal...

401
00:22:46,436 --> 00:22:47,716
Also, I want you to move back in

402
00:22:47,717 --> 00:22:49,989
to the Carouth Street house.

403
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,479
That's where you lived before the divorce,

404
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,280
that's where I want you to live now.

405
00:22:54,337 --> 00:22:55,993
- Are you sure?
- Why not?

406
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:00,569
Well you don't know Robert like I do.

407
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:04,913
Linda, I have made a career
out of men like Robert.

408
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,059
He's all hot air, trust me.

409
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,893
Okay?

410
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,919
Mr. Vandeneichal...

411
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,979
By the way, call me Ike.

412
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,659
At my hourly rate you'd be surprised

413
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,322
how much money you'll
save by calling me Ike

414
00:23:17,323 --> 00:23:18,723
instead of Mr. Vandeneichal.

415
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,513
(laughs) Okay.

416
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,653
[Ike] Good.

417
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:28,250
Mrs. Edelman and I had a deal.

418
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,363
We had a deal.

419
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,889
Now this new lawyer of hers wants to start

420
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,409
digging through my company books

421
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,793
and embarrassing my investors.

422
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,859
You know how it is.

423
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,969
These days, I mean, the big money deals,

424
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,729
they're not always done on
the sunny side of the street,

425
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,640
am I right?

426
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,590
I understand.

427
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:51,719
Before you sit down Mr. Young.

428
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,789
Are you wearing a microphone
or a tape recorder

429
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,329
or any kind of recording device?

430
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,023
What, are you serious?

431
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,140
Would you take your shirt off please?

432
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:02,963
Alright.

433
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:07,949
It's just that we're
gonna be talking about money

434
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,363
and other sensitive issues.

435
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,173
Turn around.

436
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Lower your trousers.

437
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,763
Lower your trousers, please.

438
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:23,853
Okay.

439
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,919
I hope your flair for the
dramatics is warranted.

440
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,353
You've aroused my curiosity.

441
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,957
Put your clothes on and sit down.

442
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,339
You remember when you
were a child, Mr. Young?

443
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,790
You remember the tooth fairy?

444
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,079
You remember you'd lose a
tooth, you'd make a wish,

445
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,773
and you'd put that tooth
underneath a pillow.

446
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:54,166
And in the morning when you wake up,

447
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:58,373
the tooth would be gone
and there would be money.

448
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,013
Well.

449
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,020
Wouldn't it be nice...

450
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,740
Wouldn't it be nice if
you could make a wish

451
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,910
and put money under your pillow

452
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,249
and in the morning when you wake up

453
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,803
the money would be gone and
your wish would have come true?

454
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,870
I believe in wishes, Mr. Edelman.

455
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:29,203
You wish hard enough,
any wish will come true.

456
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:33,049
(tense music)

457
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:39,872
I wish my wife was dead.

458
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,213
Well.

459
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:51,008
Well.

460
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,629
I guess now the only question to ask

461
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:59,013
is how much money do
I put under my pillow?

462
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:13,865
Wait, wait.

463
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:15,677
Be good okay, bye now.

464
00:26:15,678 --> 00:26:18,095
(horn honks)

465
00:26:20,227 --> 00:26:21,394
Hi guys, hi.

466
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,409
I want you guys to meet somebody

467
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:28,169
who's gonna be very, very
special in Daddy's life

468
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:30,399
and in your lives too, okay?

469
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,233
Come on.

470
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,122
- This is Dana.
- Hi.

471
00:26:37,123 --> 00:26:39,763
This is Stephen, Kathleen.

472
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,649
Your dad has told me all about you.

473
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,459
And I want us to help
make your dad happy again

474
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,360
by showing him what a great
time we can all have together.

475
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,819
Okay?

476
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,433
Come on, let's get in the car.

477
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,728
Come on Stephen.

478
00:26:59,729 --> 00:27:02,229
(tense music)

479
00:27:16,796 --> 00:27:19,629
(car engine revs)

480
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:30,112
(camera shutter clicking)

481
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:46,965
(school bell ringing)

482
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:49,966
(people chattering)

483
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,597
(clears throat)

484
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:32,329
(thunder rumbling)
(rain pattering)

485
00:28:55,056 --> 00:28:58,056
(suspenseful music)

486
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:08,281
(breathing heavily)

487
00:29:24,436 --> 00:29:26,869
Dad, watch, I'm gonna
do an atomic cannonball!

488
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,782
Okay, wait, Steve, wait, whoa!

489
00:29:28,783 --> 00:29:31,199
(water splashes)

490
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,249
Stephen.

491
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,476
Good.

492
00:29:33,477 --> 00:29:34,450
That was great.

493
00:29:34,451 --> 00:29:36,219
I want you to go over and
have some ice cream now, okay?

494
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,129
'Cause Dana made it just for you.

495
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,080
- Okay.
- Alright.

496
00:29:41,557 --> 00:29:43,901
Pretty spunky boy you got there.

497
00:29:43,902 --> 00:29:45,102
Yeah, he's a good kid.

498
00:29:47,674 --> 00:29:48,507
Okay.

499
00:29:50,347 --> 00:29:53,923
You know, she's never alone
except when she's at home.

500
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,040
So, isn't that where we're
planning to do it, at home?

501
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:01,753
What about the parents?

502
00:30:01,754 --> 00:30:02,839
I don't care about her parents.

503
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,133
If her parents are there, do them too.

504
00:30:05,977 --> 00:30:07,419
Just do it, alright?

505
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,253
Okay, come here.

506
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:11,916
Floor plan of the house.

507
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:13,039
That's the ground floor,

508
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,999
we've got motion detectors
over here, over here,

509
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,783
there's one over here in the stairwell.

510
00:30:19,373 --> 00:30:21,039
And there's another one somewhere.

511
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,409
Oh, over here.

512
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,611
I mean, you know, if you're
gonna do it in the house

513
00:30:23,612 --> 00:30:25,893
it should look like a robbery, right?

514
00:30:25,894 --> 00:30:28,394
Are you sure you want this
to happen in your own home?

515
00:30:28,395 --> 00:30:32,478
(sighs) Isn't that the plan,
isn't that what we discussed?

516
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:33,312
All I meant was...

517
00:30:33,312 --> 00:30:34,145
I mean I don't care,

518
00:30:34,145 --> 00:30:34,978
it doesn't make any difference to me.

519
00:30:34,978 --> 00:30:35,830
Do it wherever you want.

520
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,663
The only thing I care about
is I don't want it done

521
00:30:36,664 --> 00:30:38,109
in front of my kids.

522
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,489
Sir, I know how to do the job.

523
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,509
Well then do it!

524
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,193
Get it done.

525
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,311
Mr. Edelman.

526
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:48,729
You think killing someone is so easy,

527
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,516
maybe you should do it yourself.

528
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:51,510
(suspenseful music)

529
00:30:51,511 --> 00:30:53,135
I'd love to.

530
00:30:53,136 --> 00:30:55,336
I'd be the first one
the cops would suspect.

531
00:30:57,168 --> 00:30:59,023
If you don't get the ball rolling,

532
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,403
maybe I will.

533
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,839
(water splashes)

534
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,818
Good dive!

535
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:08,818
(claps)

536
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:27,333
[Kathleen] Mama!

537
00:31:31,736 --> 00:31:32,569
Mama!

538
00:31:35,908 --> 00:31:36,741
Mama!

539
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:38,876
Kathleen!

540
00:31:39,789 --> 00:31:41,456
Look what I found!

541
00:31:47,486 --> 00:31:49,489
Honey I told you not to
play across the street,

542
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,387
I want you to play where I can see you.

543
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:53,635
I'm sorry but look!

544
00:31:53,636 --> 00:31:54,469
(cat meowing)

545
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:55,614
Oh.

546
00:31:55,615 --> 00:31:57,110
Easy.

547
00:31:57,111 --> 00:31:57,944
Oh, look.

548
00:31:59,557 --> 00:32:01,479
Oh, oh honey.

549
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,489
He's full of fleas!

550
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:03,890
Did you see the mommy kitty?

551
00:32:05,538 --> 00:32:07,670
I think she wants us to keep it.

552
00:32:08,813 --> 00:32:11,979
Well honey you know mama
kitties love their babies

553
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,356
just as much as I love you and Stephen,

554
00:32:13,357 --> 00:32:15,269
and if I ever lost you...

555
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,739
What if Daddy and Dana
say that they can keep it

556
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,990
at their house?

557
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,449
Well, let's see.

558
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:24,219
You know, it's almost
time for your dance class.

559
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,020
Why don't you let me think about it?

560
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:32,787
Will you and Daddy
ever live together again?

561
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,833
No honey, we won't.

562
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,159
Daddy's gonna live in his house

563
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,267
and you and Stephen and I
are gonna live in our house.

564
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:46,524
Daddy says if he marries Dana

565
00:32:46,525 --> 00:32:49,608
that means that she's our new mother.

566
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,289
Well that's just silly.

567
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,523
Because I'm always gonna be your mommy.

568
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,139
And Daddy's always gonna be your daddy.

569
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,763
And divorce doesn't change that.

570
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:05,303
Okay?

571
00:33:10,252 --> 00:33:13,343
I think maybe we better give
your new kitty a bath, huh?

572
00:33:13,344 --> 00:33:14,676
- Okay.
- Okay.

573
00:33:14,677 --> 00:33:17,677
(suspenseful music)

574
00:33:20,648 --> 00:33:24,148
(camera shutter clicking)

575
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,251
(laughing)

576
00:33:28,252 --> 00:33:29,661
Well what do you think we should call her?

577
00:33:29,662 --> 00:33:32,964
[Kathleen] I wanna call her Millie.

578
00:33:32,965 --> 00:33:36,678
(mellow country music)
(chattering and laughing)

579
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:39,736
[Man] No time, Brad, all right.

580
00:33:39,737 --> 00:33:40,570
Hey.

581
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,970
Alright, at ease gentlemen.

582
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,313
Anyway, Fred.

583
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,689
Look I talked to my
people and I'm just sorry

584
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,869
the job didn't come through.

585
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,555
Wasn't there another
job you were saying?

586
00:33:57,556 --> 00:33:58,389
That.

587
00:33:58,389 --> 00:33:59,320
Well.

588
00:33:59,321 --> 00:34:01,196
That's a mission, you know.

589
00:34:01,197 --> 00:34:02,197
A mission?

590
00:34:03,133 --> 00:34:07,319
Well, uh, in 'Nam, people
that I killed in combat,

591
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,870
I didn't count that as killing.

592
00:34:10,971 --> 00:34:11,804
It was a job.

593
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,773
Just a mission, just part of my job.

594
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:20,359
Well this mission you
gotta think of as combat.

595
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,873
Only for a lot more money.

596
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,350
What are you talking about?

597
00:34:26,613 --> 00:34:29,959
There's this guy, it's his wife.

598
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,913
He wants her

599
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,693
killed.

600
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,273
I could use the money.

601
00:34:40,728 --> 00:34:42,519
But not that bad.

602
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,495
Look.

603
00:34:43,495 --> 00:34:44,350
Thing you gotta understand is this job

604
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:48,789
is gonna go down even if my
man has to do it himself.

605
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,183
All I need from you is a name.

606
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,433
Just somebody who could do the job.

607
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,003
There would be a finder's fee.

608
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:02,850
You wouldn't have to do anything else.

609
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,103
You just give me a name.

610
00:35:11,105 --> 00:35:12,035
(cartoonish music)

611
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:14,618
Somebody's trying to kill me.

612
00:35:15,795 --> 00:35:18,378
(horn honking)

613
00:35:28,617 --> 00:35:30,928
(phone ringing)

614
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:31,762
Yeah?

615
00:35:33,481 --> 00:35:35,125
Okay.

616
00:35:35,126 --> 00:35:36,709
He's on his way up.

617
00:35:40,932 --> 00:35:44,032
(cat screeches)

618
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:46,700
(door knocking)

619
00:35:53,508 --> 00:35:54,841
He's right here.

620
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,713
So.

621
00:35:58,714 --> 00:35:59,843
You must be Zack.

622
00:36:05,357 --> 00:36:06,539
You know I'm glad Fred found you.

623
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,644
I was starting to think I'd
have to do this job myself.

624
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:12,089
(chuckles)

625
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:15,459
Fred says that you're in a hurry.

626
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,779
I told Zack how it has to look

627
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,009
like a robbery and all that.

628
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:21,712
Fred, why don't you just leave?

629
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,419
I mean you don't need to know
any more than you already do.

630
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,433
Just go.

631
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,650
All right.

632
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:38,223
My client is facing a
court date in late July.

633
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,603
He'd like his marriage to
be terminated before then.

634
00:36:44,604 --> 00:36:47,349
(suspenseful music)

635
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,763
An out of court settlement?

636
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,533
Exactly.

637
00:36:54,738 --> 00:36:58,498
(cheerful carnival music)

638
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:01,332
(kids chattering)

639
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:06,809
And the judge granted our request,

640
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,339
Robert has to let Kathleen
dance in the recital?

641
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,290
Even though it's on Robert's weekend.

642
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,055
Thank you so much.

643
00:37:14,056 --> 00:37:17,031
(laughs) You don't have to
thank me, you're paying me.

644
00:37:17,032 --> 00:37:18,735
And I better get going.

645
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,729
I have to admit, this is one court order

646
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,413
that I am going to enjoy
delivering personally.

647
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,859
You know my folks are
driving all the way down here

648
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,263
from Oklahoma, this means
so much to Kathleen.

649
00:37:31,304 --> 00:37:33,582
And it's not just a recital, Linda.

650
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:36,380
We'll get you your settlement
before you know it.

651
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,339
It's hard to believe it'll ever be over.

652
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,239
Ah, Robert knows he's lost.

653
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,654
He and his lawyer are starting to act

654
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:46,473
like a couple of well-trained puppies.

655
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:01,458
Hey you two!

656
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:05,022
Hey we're gonna go home
after one more time, okay?

657
00:38:05,023 --> 00:38:05,856
Oh!

658
00:38:05,857 --> 00:38:07,259

662
00:38:52,536 --> 00:38:56,332
That was great, you girls were wonderful!

663
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,327
Mommy, Mommy, did you see me?

664
00:38:58,328 --> 00:39:00,459
I saw you honey, you
were the most beautiful

665
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,819
princess I ever saw.

666
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,229
I can't wait for Grandpa
to take your picture.

667
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:06,519
Baby, you were so good!

668
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,639
You were wonderful, I was so proud of you.

669
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,959
Come on, let's go home.

670
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,909
But Daddy, it isn't over.

671
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:12,989
Yes, I know sweetheart.

672
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,137
[Linda] She wants to see
the rest of the program.

673
00:39:14,138 --> 00:39:14,971
But we're gonna go home now.

674
00:39:14,971 --> 00:39:15,804
[Linda] That was the agreement.

675
00:39:15,805 --> 00:39:18,170
Okay don't you dare talk
to me about an agreement!

676
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:21,809
Court said I had to let
her dance, she's danced!

677
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,156
She belongs to me for
the rest of the weekend.

678
00:39:24,157 --> 00:39:24,990
(crowd applauding)

679
00:39:24,991 --> 00:39:26,182
They're bringing Stephen.

680
00:39:26,183 --> 00:39:29,107
They wouldn't let me take him.

681
00:39:29,108 --> 00:39:32,459
Linda, this is my fiancee Dana Shoreham.

682
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,399
Dana, this is the bitch I told you about.

683
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,285
Come on.

("Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy")

685
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:38,600
Hello lovely.

686
00:39:38,601 --> 00:39:42,336
Oh, you were so good,
we're so proud of you.

687
00:39:42,337 --> 00:39:43,549
Oh you were so beautiful!

688
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,919
Ooh, mwah!

689
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,139
Okay guys, come on, let's go now.

690
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:47,973
Let's go.

691
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,103
Bye bye Mommy.

(Linda sighs)

693
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:04,463
Some more coffee when you get a chance.

694
00:40:15,412 --> 00:40:16,919
This is very important.

695
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,386
He wants it done when he has the kids

696
00:40:18,387 --> 00:40:20,189
so there won't be any
chance of them seeing it.

697
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:21,030
You told me.

698
00:40:21,031 --> 00:40:22,732
You've already told me that.

699
00:40:22,733 --> 00:40:25,683
You know I'm really impressed
with your client's big heart.

700
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,150
Here are the dates.

701

What do the astronauts call 'em?

702
00:40:32,234 --> 00:40:35,109
The windows of opportunity?

703
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:36,160
Yeah, that's right.

704
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:41,119
It's got to be done on one of
these windows of opportunity.

Now, you could even do it tomorrow.

707
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:47,830
She's going to her hairdresser's tomorrow.

708
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:51,422
[Zack] How do you know?

709
00:40:51,423 --> 00:40:53,170
[James] It's my job to know.

710
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:49,549
Linda, hi!

711
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,209
Hi.

712
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,729
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming down?

713
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,563
We could have come together.

714
00:41:54,563 --> 00:41:55,396
Well I didn't know myself,

715
00:41:55,397 --> 00:41:57,489
they had a last-minute cancellation.

00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:58,805

718
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:00,472
[Linda] I'm having a trim.

719
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:03,549
Well how've you been?

720
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,623
You don't call me, you don't come over.

721
00:42:06,778 --> 00:42:09,509
Well this last week it's
just been, you know...

722
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,969
You're my friend.

723
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:11,803
I miss you.

724
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:14,669
Why don't you come over later

725
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,678
and we'll have a barbecue?

726
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:18,439
Oh my folks are here and...

727
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,543
Well bring them too!

728
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,029
Alright I will.

729
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:22,863
Okay.

730
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,372
Thanks.

731
00:42:25,373 --> 00:42:26,823
- I'll see you later.
- Alright.

732
00:42:31,024 --> 00:42:33,857
(players yelling)

733
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,053
Five minute warning!

734
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:39,309
Linda, would you get the drink orders?

735
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,525
Sure, okay, what's everybody gonna have?

736
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:43,403
[John] Diet anything!

737
00:42:43,404 --> 00:42:44,416
Two diet anythings!

738
00:42:44,417 --> 00:42:45,809
I want a root beer!

739
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,999
Alright, that's four diet anythings

740
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,756
and a root beer, got it.

741
00:42:49,757 --> 00:42:52,989
Alright, get the slaw and beans ready,

742
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,384
here comes the meat!

743
00:42:54,385 --> 00:42:55,837
(laughing)

744
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:56,671
Whoa, ho!

745
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:59,079
Forest fire.

746
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,247
[Woman] Here, here here.

747
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:06,439
Linda, it's Ike
Vandeneichal, says it's urgent.

748
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,314
He needs to see you in
his office right away.

749
00:43:09,315 --> 00:43:10,148
Okay.

750
00:43:22,482 --> 00:43:24,149
Mom, wait!

751
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,997
Stephen, go back to Terri's.

752
00:43:25,998 --> 00:43:26,850
I don't want you to go!

753
00:43:26,851 --> 00:43:28,239
Honey, will you relax?

754
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,389
I'm just going to Ike's.

755
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:30,223
When will you be back?

756
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:31,988
I won't be long, go
take care of Kathleen,

757
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:33,572
I'll be right back.

758
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,782
(suspenseful music)

759
00:45:05,642 --> 00:45:08,059
(horn honks)

760
00:45:21,355 --> 00:45:24,470
(horn honking)

761
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,721
Hey, move it!

762
00:45:28,004 --> 00:45:29,523
Hey, I'm trying to move!

763
00:45:30,431 --> 00:45:31,264
Get!

764
00:45:33,529 --> 00:45:36,362
(tires squealing)

765
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,515
Come on baby.

766
00:46:13,516 --> 00:46:16,443
Come on baby, where'd you go?

767
00:46:16,444 --> 00:46:18,329
Where'd you go?

768
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:21,163
(tires squealing)

769
00:47:29,217 --> 00:47:32,032
(breathing heavily)

770
00:47:32,033 --> 00:47:34,783
(elevator dings)

771
00:47:41,301 --> 00:47:42,884
- No wait!
- Oh crap!

772
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,033
Ike, Ike!

773
00:47:57,883 --> 00:48:00,889
Ike, I'm sorry, somebody's following me,

774
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:02,009
all the way over here, I thought...

775
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:02,843
[Ike] Linda.

776
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:04,963
Mrs. Edelman.

777
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:09,519
It's alright, it's alright Mrs. Edelman.

778
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,499
We're with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation,

779
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,343
this is Agent Zachary Bell.

780
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,750
And I'm Special Agent Joseph Masterson.

781
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:27,259
Mrs. Edelman, do you know
or have you ever heard of

782
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,943
a Mr. or Colonel James Young?

783
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,610
No, what's this about?

784
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,343
Linda.

785
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:42,923
Robert hired someone
to, uh, to murder you.

786
00:48:44,785 --> 00:48:48,087
(tense music)

787
00:48:48,088 --> 00:48:51,088
(breathing heavily)

788
00:48:52,093 --> 00:48:53,093
Oh my god.

789
00:48:54,903 --> 00:48:56,173
Did you arrest him?

790
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,703
No ma'am, no, we haven't yet.

791
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,140
But everything is under control.

792
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,829
Well if you haven't arrested
him, nothing's under control.

793
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:08,729
You don't know Robert.

794
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:10,929
We haven't arrested your husband because

795
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:14,119
Agent Bell here is the
person who has been hired

796
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,359
to commit this crime.

797
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,549
Now he was hired, not by your husband,

798
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:20,519
but by a middle man that
your husband contracted.

799
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,579
A Mr. James Young.

800
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:25,019
The point is they already
have all the evidence

801
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,373
they need against Young.

802
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,659
But they haven't yet got
enough evidence to get

803
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,253
a conviction against Robert.

804
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:35,909
Well when will you?

805
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:40,319
Well we'd like to catch
Mr. Edelman in the act

806
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,399
of making a payment to Agent Bell

807
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,583
while the agent is posing as the hit man.

808
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,089
[Zack] Unfortunately
there's no more money due

809
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,793
until after you're dead.

810
00:49:52,693 --> 00:49:55,383
And that is why we need your help.

811
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:03,279
And if I don't help
you I'm as good as dead.

812
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,593
Is that what you're saying?

813
00:50:05,476 --> 00:50:07,976
(tense music)

814
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:49,103
- I'm sorry folks.
- What took so long?

815
00:50:49,104 --> 00:50:49,937
Where are the kids?

816
00:50:49,938 --> 00:50:51,119
The kids are fine.

817
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,019
We just put them to bed.

818
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,539
But we were getting concerned about you.

819
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:57,149
Ike had to brief me about
the court date coming up.

820
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:59,589
Oh, lawyer without a
telephone, how unusual,

821
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:00,466
that's why she couldn't call us.

822
00:51:00,467 --> 00:51:02,011
Dad, I'm sorry, Dad, I'm sorry.

823
00:51:02,012 --> 00:51:04,616
Look I'm really tired, I
can't talk right now, okay?

824
00:51:04,617 --> 00:51:06,867
I'll see you in the
morning, I love you both.

825
00:51:19,853 --> 00:51:20,686
Hi.

826
00:51:21,807 --> 00:51:22,640
Hi.

827
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,763
Millie threw up.

828
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:26,773
She did?

829
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:31,839
Well was it food or was it
like water with grass in it?

830
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,700
Food.

831
00:51:32,701 --> 00:51:35,840
Kathleen wouldn't touch
it so I cleaned it up.

832
00:51:37,481 --> 00:51:39,723
Well, I'll take her to the vet tomorrow.

833
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:43,739
You lied to me.

834
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,283
You said you wouldn't be gone a long time!

835
00:51:48,412 --> 00:51:50,912
(Linda sighs)

836
00:51:54,989 --> 00:51:55,822
Stephen.

837
00:51:57,803 --> 00:52:00,063
Stephen, I'm sorry you're mad at me, okay?

838
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:06,039
Dad and Dana are taking
us to Europe this summer

839
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,333
and you aren't going.

840
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:11,673
Thanks.

841
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:13,924
Honey.

842
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:17,509
I didn't lie to you, okay?

843
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,433
I didn't!

844
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:23,699
I love you very much
and I didn't lie to you.

845
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,543
I came home as soon as I could.

846
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:29,579
(sighs)

847
00:53:10,142 --> 00:53:13,142
(suspenseful music)

848
00:53:33,633 --> 00:53:35,043
He must be lost.

849
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:37,970
Mom, go back in the house.

850
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:41,102
Well tell them whatever they're selling,

851
00:53:41,103 --> 00:53:42,493
(phone ringing)
you don't want it.

852
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:44,569
Will you go answer
the phone for me, Mom?

853
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:46,019
I'll handle this.

854
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,519
Excuse me.

855
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,120
You must have the wrong address.

856
00:53:50,173 --> 00:53:53,259
No, I think this is
the right place, ma'am.

857
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,739
I didn't order you.

858
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:56,449
Why don't we discuss this inside.

859
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,563
- Excuse me.
- Linda.

860
00:53:59,984 --> 00:54:01,883
There's a Mr. Masterson calling.

861
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:04,879
He's our supervisor, ma'am.

862
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,349
He sent us to check the
house for those bugs

863
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:08,600
he thinks you might have.

864
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:12,889
[Virginia] You wanna talk
to this Mr. Masterson or not?

865
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:15,353
He needs to talk to you, Mrs. Edelman.

866
00:54:27,957 --> 00:54:30,719
(mumbling) and rob them blind.

867
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,089
Never seen them before,
and you leave them alone

868
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:34,000
in your own home.

869
00:54:34,001 --> 00:54:35,099
There's nobody in this place,

870
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,969
are you sure it's open hon?

871
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:39,589
Mom and Dad, let's just
sit over here, alright?

872
00:54:39,590 --> 00:54:41,703
Come on, let's just sit down.

873
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,459
[John] Italian food.

874
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:52,469
You know I hate Italian food,

875
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:53,923
it all tastes like pizza.

876
00:54:57,741 --> 00:54:58,809
May we have some water please?

877
00:54:58,810 --> 00:54:59,643
Mother.

878
00:54:59,644 --> 00:55:02,293
Mother, this is Mr.
Masterson from the FBI.

879
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:05,742
[John] This is about Robert, isn't it?

880
00:55:05,743 --> 00:55:09,105
Dad, just let Mr.
Masterson tell you, okay?

881
00:55:09,106 --> 00:55:10,743
Oh, sure, no, fine.

882
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,129
What did Robert do?

883
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,379
I know he didn't get my money,

884
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,599
I'm sitting on my wallet.

885
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,769
Mr. and Mrs. DeSilva,
your daughter's life

886
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:21,423
is in great danger.

887
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,273
Yours too.

888
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:25,333
Mom, Dad.

889
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,693
Robert hired someone to murder me.

890
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:35,042
My god.
(tense music)

891
00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:36,723
- My god!
- It's okay honey,

892
00:55:36,724 --> 00:55:37,570
it's gonna be alright.

893
00:55:37,571 --> 00:55:39,919
[Linda] I wanted to tell you
last night, I just couldn't.

894
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,769
Your son in law is an
extremely dangerous man.

895
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:46,819
It's very important that
he not know we're onto him.

896
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,319
What do you want us to do?

897
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,939
Robert expects me to be
killed when he has custody

898
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,173
of Stephen and Kathleen.

899
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:56,649
And of course they can't arrest
him until he returns them.

900
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:58,689
Now when the children are returned,

901
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:00,149
we would like the two of you to be there

902
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:01,670
so that you can receive them.

903
00:56:03,014 --> 00:56:05,009
And by then the payment
will have been made,

904
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:07,503
you'll have the children, we'll move in.

905
00:56:18,890 --> 00:56:21,489
So was my house bugged?

906
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:22,723
Uh, no.

907
00:56:23,719 --> 00:56:25,589
No, it was clean.

908
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,423
Didn't find anything.

909
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:28,863
But act as if it is.

910
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,609
This is no time to feel safe.

911
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:33,160
Stay close to home and...

912
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:39,113
What?

913
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:44,859
It's just that remember
that we have no way of knowing

914
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,669
whether or not our
agent is the only person

915
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,370
that Robert has hired to kill you.

916
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,753
Thursday's my 40th birthday.

917
00:57:00,345 --> 00:57:01,723
Most people dread it.

918
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:06,723
But assuming I get to turn 40,

919
00:57:10,164 --> 00:57:10,997
when do I die?

920
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,843
In four days.

921
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:20,263
(breathes deeply)

922
00:57:31,168 --> 00:57:32,001
Where the hell you been?

923
00:57:32,002 --> 00:57:33,833
You know my client is very upset.

924
00:57:34,691 --> 00:57:37,200
- Is that right, I wanna...
- What's the delay?

925
00:57:37,201 --> 00:57:38,679
Why don't you take this to your client

926
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,712
and bring me back a positive ID, will you?

927
00:57:40,713 --> 00:57:42,259
Look the man is tired of waiting,

928
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:43,739
he could go with somebody else.

929
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,739
I told you I'm not gonna be rushed.

930
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,549
All I'm saying is if you want the money

931
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:49,649
then you gotta complete the mission.

932
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:50,719
We could get cut out of this

933
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,559
and he could decide to do this himself.

934
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,949
Listen, I'm not gonna do anything until

935
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:56,263
I'm 100% sure that I got the right person.

936
00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:00,619
- This is the right person!
- Yeah right.

937
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:02,120
Just show that to your client.

938
00:58:03,244 --> 00:58:05,009
What the hell you talking about?

939
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:07,760
And have him put his initials
on it for me, will you?

940
00:58:27,266 --> 00:58:29,006
[Linda] Well?

941
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:31,479
100 people went in the store
and another 100 came out,

942
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,423
I don't know if you're being followed.

943
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:38,030
Miriam thinks you're acting strange.

944
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:41,780
You didn't say anything, did you?

945
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:44,869
I said you'd been acting
strange ever since this

946
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:47,819
divorce business began,
and I told her not to miss

947
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,283
your birthday party tonight.

948
00:58:51,965 --> 00:58:53,215
You okay Mom?

949
00:58:55,183 --> 00:58:56,593
Tomorrow's the day.

950
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,513
I don't know who I'm more
afraid for, you or the kids.

951
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,763
It's gonna be okay, I promise.

952
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,526
Don't cry, okay?

953
00:59:15,527 --> 00:59:16,977
(crying)

954
00:59:16,978 --> 00:59:20,215
(suspenseful music)

955
00:59:20,216 --> 00:59:24,633
(patrons chattering over each other)

956
00:59:27,149 --> 00:59:29,149
- Ah, great.
- Thank you.

957
00:59:36,427 --> 00:59:38,223
Make it look like a robbery.

958
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:41,419
Take her purse, jewelry, earrings, money,

959
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,670
the whole shooting match.

960
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,839
Is this her?

961
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,259
What the hell, what
are you talking about?

962
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,709
You don't know?

963
00:59:49,710 --> 00:59:51,789
Look, you gotta be
sure, I gotta be sure,

964
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:53,059
that way there's no mistakes.

965
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:53,943
Now is this her?

966
00:59:55,255 --> 00:59:57,053
[Robert] Yes, of course that's her.

967
00:59:59,643 --> 01:00:01,339
What's he saying?

968
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,173
Are we getting all this?

969
01:00:02,174 --> 01:00:03,669
I think he's IDed the photo,

970
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:05,264
he's IDed Linda's photo.

971
01:00:05,265 --> 01:00:06,886
I should be able to
enhance this back at the lab.

972
01:00:06,887 --> 01:00:07,832
You should what?

973
01:00:07,833 --> 01:00:09,839
I should be able to
enhance this back in the lab.

974
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:10,673
Well how much?

975
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:11,506
I can't be sure.

976
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:12,607
Well that's not good enough!

977
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:14,539
You know what I say Joe,
I say we take this guy out

978
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:16,369
right now, we got more
than enough on Young

979
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:17,439
to make him roll over on Edelman.

980
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:18,649
And if he doesn't roll over?

981
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:20,289
Well we've got Fred's testimony.

982
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:21,290
What are you worried about?

983
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:23,359
I'm worried about the
courts kicking this guy loose,

984
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,852
I'm worried about a
woman and her two kids.

985
01:00:24,853 --> 01:00:26,269
Well so am I, damnit!

986
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:27,639
But if we don't take this guy down soon

987
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,899
he's gonna forget about me,

988
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,029
he's gonna find another
way to get this job done.

989
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,959
Excuse me guys, if you're
gonna fight, take it outside.

990
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,379
I'm trying to hear what's going on.

991
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:36,599
Zack.

992
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,788
I want Edelman's slimy
fingerprints on some money,

993
01:00:38,789 --> 01:00:41,379
I want this case airtight.

994
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:44,571
♪ And many more ♪

995
01:00:44,572 --> 01:00:46,383
(laughing)

996
01:00:46,384 --> 01:00:47,996
(clapping)
Yay!

997
01:00:47,997 --> 01:00:49,387
Mommy, make a wish!

998
01:00:49,388 --> 01:00:50,327
Yeah, make a wish!

999
01:00:50,328 --> 01:00:51,871
Okay, hold hands, hold
hands, hold hands, here we go.

1000
01:00:51,872 --> 01:00:52,969
Okay, here we go.

1001
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:53,803
Um.

1002
01:00:54,727 --> 01:00:56,727
(blows)

1003
01:00:57,587 --> 01:01:00,920
(cheering and clapping)

1004
01:01:02,911 --> 01:01:06,359
Okay, okay, let's cut this cake.

1005
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:09,689
This is a fabulous looking cake.

1006
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:10,633
Who is the chef?

1007
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:12,474
[Stephen] I did the letters.

1008
01:01:12,475 --> 01:01:15,558
[Kathleen] And I did the sprinkles.

1009
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:19,069
This looks so good.

1010
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:21,470
Ooh, wait, I missed your
frosting, there you go.

1011
01:01:23,748 --> 01:01:28,169
Mommy, can I have two
scoops of ice cream?

1012
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:29,609
No honey, that's way too much sugar.

1013
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:30,739
What, you wanna carry your teeth around

1014
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,214
in your back pocket?

1015
01:01:32,215 --> 01:01:34,465
(laughing)

1016
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:37,343
Dana gives us two scoops.

1017
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,660
Well Dana isn't your mother, is she?

1018
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,159
Don't you forget it.

1019
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:52,993
One.

1020
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:57,483
Okay, anybody else for ice cream?

1021
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:07,529
I just wanna thank you
for a wonderful birthday.

1022
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:11,189
Did Grandpa and Grandma leave already?

1023
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:12,819
Yeah honey they had
to take Aunt Miriam home

1024
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,387
and it's a long drive.

1025
01:02:14,388 --> 01:02:16,096
Do I have to go to Daddy's tomorrow?

1026
01:02:16,097 --> 01:02:18,410
I have a bad tummy ache.

1027
01:02:20,165 --> 01:02:21,683
Too much cake you think?

1028
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:25,959
Daddy and Dana call you bad names

1029
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:27,813
and they make us say them too.

1030
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,553
[Stephen] Mom!

1031
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:35,929
Yes Stephen?

1032
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:37,739
[Stephen] Millie threw up again.

1033
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,190
I'll be right there, honey.

1034
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:43,603
I want you to remember one thing, okay?

1035
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,309
Sticks and stones can break my bones

1036
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,303
but names can never hurt me.

1037
01:02:50,763 --> 01:02:52,513
Happy birthday, Mom.

1038
01:02:55,259 --> 01:02:57,380
I love you so much.

1039
01:02:57,381 --> 01:02:59,258
- I love you too.
- Sleep tight.

1040
01:02:59,259 --> 01:03:00,577
- Okay.
- Okay, night.

1041
01:03:00,578 --> 01:03:01,411
Night.

1042
01:03:20,873 --> 01:03:23,456
(horn honking)

1043
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,969
Will you call us and
tell us that Millie's okay?

1044
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,702
As soon as the vet
tells me, I'll tell you.

1045
01:03:38,703 --> 01:03:42,891
Will you call us anyway
and tell us you love us?

1046
01:03:42,892 --> 01:03:44,342
Well your dad's in a hurry.

1047
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
(suspenseful music)

1048
01:04:09,733 --> 01:04:12,483
(engine revving)

1049
01:04:35,977 --> 01:04:38,477
(tense music)

1050
01:05:06,234 --> 01:05:09,482
(door clatters)

1051
01:05:09,483 --> 01:05:10,316
Hello?

1052
01:06:54,393 --> 01:06:55,347
(gasps)

1053
01:06:55,348 --> 01:06:58,097
(shade rattling)

1054
01:07:07,669 --> 01:07:10,336
(phone ringing)

1055
01:07:13,146 --> 01:07:13,979
Hello?

1056
01:07:15,596 --> 01:07:16,429
Ike.

1057
01:07:18,424 --> 01:07:20,732
Yes, I know where it is.

1058
01:07:20,733 --> 01:07:23,443
7:30, okay, I'll be there.

1059
01:07:32,821 --> 01:07:35,821
(suspenseful music)

1060
01:08:26,266 --> 01:08:27,502
Hey.
(gasps)

1061
01:08:27,503 --> 01:08:28,699
Oh.

1062
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:29,993
You wanna catch a movie?

1063
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,140
I can't, I'm meeting with Ike

1064
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:33,713
about the property inventory.

1065
01:08:34,890 --> 01:08:36,083
On a Friday night?

1066
01:08:37,627 --> 01:08:38,590
Yeah.

1067
01:08:38,591 --> 01:08:40,429
[Terri] How's the kitten?

1068
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:43,299
Oh my god, I forgot
to pick up the kitten!

1069
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:46,253
Relax kid, the vet's closed.

1070
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:48,790
When will you be back?

1071
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,739
I don't know.

1072
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:51,660
I'll call you later, okay?

1073
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:53,683
I'm sorry, I really have to go.

1074
01:09:41,471 --> 01:09:44,804
(police radio chatters)

1075
01:09:45,843 --> 01:09:47,902
I want one man units.

1076
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,389
Stay with guns.

1077
01:09:49,390 --> 01:09:50,604
Red team, you watch the house,

1078
01:09:50,605 --> 01:09:53,699
blue team, you make sure
you stay with Mrs. Edelman.

1079
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:57,459
And remember only point
to point radio contact.

1080
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,832
We don't know who might be
listening on the scanner.

1081
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:01,868
Did you bring the clothes you bought?

1082
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:05,107
- In the back.
- May I have the keys?

1083
01:10:05,108 --> 01:10:06,881
You didn't bring anything from the house?

1084
01:10:06,882 --> 01:10:07,715
No.

1085
01:10:07,716 --> 01:10:11,132
[Zack] Can I have your jewelry, please?

1086
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,030
And don't forget your wedding ring.

1087
01:10:16,516 --> 01:10:17,349
You're not going to arrest Robert

1088
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:18,599
while he has the children?

1089
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,348
We won't make a move
until he's made the payoff

1090
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,049
and the kids are with your parents.

1091
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:23,400
I'll need your purse too.

1092
01:10:29,470 --> 01:10:30,770
It's my favorite.

1093
01:10:30,771 --> 01:10:32,469
Make it all the more believable.

1094
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:34,329
Everything's in it, you didn't keep

1095
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:36,133
any personal charm or photo?

1096
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:38,538
No.

1097
01:10:38,539 --> 01:10:40,456
Okay, I'm outta here.

1098
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,169
Where are you taking me?

1099
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:48,346
Well, Ike has been kind
enough to let us use his cabin

1100
01:10:48,347 --> 01:10:49,589
by the lake.

1101
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:53,069
It's very private, only one
road in, it'll be perfect.

1102
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:55,920
You're gonna get your money's
worth out of this lawyer.

1103
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:00,313
Linda, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

1104
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:06,163
You okay?

1105
01:11:07,493 --> 01:11:09,843
I'll be okay when I
see Kathleen and Stephen.

1106
01:11:32,853 --> 01:11:35,520
(phone ringing)

1107
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:38,939
Yes?

1108
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:40,089
Yeah.

1109
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:42,943
Just tell your client that
his divorce just became final.

1110
01:11:45,413 --> 01:11:47,979
(sighs) Thank you.

1111
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:50,761
Call me back tomorrow
regarding billing arrangements.

1112
01:11:50,762 --> 01:11:51,595
Good.

1113
01:11:53,562 --> 01:11:56,395
(dial tone rings)

1114
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:01,481
(people chattering)

1115
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:11,870
Excuse me.

1116
01:12:11,871 --> 01:12:14,871
(suspenseful music)

1117
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:26,543
Yes?

1118
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,483
Mission accomplished.

1119
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:34,540
That's very good news.

1120
01:12:37,905 --> 01:12:38,977
No.

1121
01:12:38,978 --> 01:12:40,553
No, we'll talk about that later.

1122
01:12:46,338 --> 01:12:50,921
(party guests chattering and laughing)

1123
01:13:01,980 --> 01:13:03,109
Guys?

1124
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:03,943
Excuse me.

1125
01:13:05,123 --> 01:13:05,956
Hey, psst.

1126
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:11,043
Excuse me.

1127
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:13,610
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

1128
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:18,803
Today I'm a very lucky man.

1129
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:24,230
I guess you could even say
that I'm blessed in business

1130
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:28,823
and in love.
(glasses clink)

1131
01:13:30,109 --> 01:13:31,859
And so I'd like to propose a toast.

1132
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:35,101
To the future.

1133
01:13:35,102 --> 01:13:37,336
[Woman] Cheers.

1134
01:13:37,337 --> 01:13:40,901
- And a killer year.
- Hey, that's right.

1135
01:13:40,902 --> 01:13:43,319
(applauding)

1136
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:02,991
What's wrong?

1137
01:14:02,992 --> 01:14:03,970
I don't know, she isn't here.

1138
01:14:03,971 --> 01:14:05,009
Her car is gone.

1139
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:06,039
Did she leave a note?

1140
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,299
She was meeting with Ike last night.

1141
01:14:07,300 --> 01:14:09,889
I tried Ike but he's
not in his office yet.

1142
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:11,649
Looks like she slept here last night.

1143
01:14:11,650 --> 01:14:14,699
She wasn't here last night,
I called her all night long.

1144
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,849
She didn't sleep in this
bed but it's been messed up

1145
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:18,209
to look as if she did.

1146
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:19,110
Call your folks.

1147
01:14:19,111 --> 01:14:20,453
I tried, no answer.

1148
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:22,943
It's gotta be Robert.

1149
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:24,889
We better call the police.

1150
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:26,239
That is what I'm trying to do,

1151
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:28,219
but they've had me on hold for 10 minutes.

1152
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:30,770
Well then let's go down
there in person, come on.

1153
01:14:35,339 --> 01:14:38,089
(birds chirping)

1154
01:14:40,378 --> 01:14:43,147
(door creaks)

1155
01:14:43,148 --> 01:14:45,899
You put everything you
wore last night in here?

1156
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:47,249
Underclothes too?

1157
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,083
Every stitch.

1158
01:14:49,010 --> 01:14:50,609
Well, I better get to Masterson.

1159
01:14:50,610 --> 01:14:51,739
Who called this morning?

1160
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:53,253
My office.

1161
01:14:53,254 --> 01:14:54,087
And?

1162
01:14:55,567 --> 01:14:58,529
Miriam and Terri have
already gone to the police.

1163
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:00,230
They're raising all kinds of hell.

1164
01:15:01,932 --> 01:15:03,519
That's gonna ruin everything.

1165
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,789
If I'm officially missing

1166
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:07,159
then Robert doesn't have to
return Kathleen and Stephen!

1167
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,483
Linda, the FBI knows what it's doing.

1168
01:15:10,346 --> 01:15:12,309
Now Monday Robert will drop off the kids.

1169
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:13,783
Just stop worrying.

1170
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,046
It's the kids I'm worried about.

1171
01:15:17,047 --> 01:15:19,897
I mean you realize that they're
in the hands of a killer.

1172
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:24,539
You just stay inside.

1173
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:25,747
Keep the doors locked.

1174
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:33,769
I just took the whole model down

1175
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:35,699
to the real estate commission
complete with little cars,

1176
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:37,029
trees, everything.

1177
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:39,364
So when you brought up this
project, what did they say

1178
01:15:39,365 --> 01:15:40,198
- if they're so brilliant?
- They're jerks,

1179
01:15:40,199 --> 01:15:41,731
come on, come on, they're jerks.

1180
01:15:41,732 --> 01:15:43,639
I told them I don't care
if the buildings stay empty

1181
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:45,522
the next five years,
they own them, I don't.

1182
01:15:45,523 --> 01:15:46,356
God they're so stupid.

1183
01:15:46,357 --> 01:15:47,729
Can we call Mom?

1184
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:49,779
Stephen, that was rude.

1185
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:52,679
I've told you never interrupt
when adults are talking.

1186
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:54,469
But she was supposed to call last night

1187
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:56,163
and tell us Millie was okay.

1188
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,943
Stephen you called just an hour ago.

1189
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:00,896
She wasn't there.

1190
01:16:00,897 --> 01:16:01,730
How do you know?

1191
01:16:01,731 --> 01:16:03,502
Maybe she's just out in the backyard.

1192
01:16:03,503 --> 01:16:04,993
[Kathleen] Miriam said so.

1193
01:16:09,716 --> 01:16:11,609
Wait a minute, if your mom wasn't there

1194
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:12,910
what's Miriam doing there?

1195
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:17,209
Did she say where your mom was?

1196
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:19,533
Let them call, for crying out loud.

1197
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:22,339
This is so boring.

1198
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:23,890
No, this is very interesting.

1199
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:28,173
Did Miriam say where your mother was?

1200
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:32,419
Answer me, Stephen!

1201
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:35,769
Did Miriam say where your mom
was, has she spoken to her?

1202
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:36,923
I don't know.

1203
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:44,349
Okay.

1204
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:45,999
Come on guys.

1205
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,150
Let's go call your mom.

1206
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:51,703
Wash the dishes.

1207
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,663
I've done the deed, man.

1208
01:17:01,957 --> 01:17:02,957
You shoulda seen it.

1209
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:05,243
Now I want my money.

1210
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,939
Well he wants to wait until
the police find the body.

1211
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:11,759
Find the body, man, they're
not gonna find nothing.

1212
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,339
Nothing, you understand me?

1213
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,143
But I did bring something for you.

1214
01:17:17,687 --> 01:17:20,187
You think he might want
some proof, show him this.

1215
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:23,343
Come on, show him that.

1216
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,222
Recognize those?

1217
01:17:26,223 --> 01:17:29,223
(suspenseful music)

1218
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:31,710
Can't talk to him tonight.

1219
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:35,170
You tell him I want my money.

1220
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:37,773
Tuesday.

1221
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:39,833
Nothing before Tuesday.

1222
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:43,139
Yeah okay, yeah that's
good, fine, Tuesday's good,

1223
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:44,590
I like Tuesdays, that's fine.

1224
01:17:46,281 --> 01:17:48,539
I want my money from you guys, man.

1225
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:51,147
Or you know it's gonna hit the fan!

1226
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,990
I'll see you Tuesday!

1227
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:01,473
Well, have you seen my mom today?

1228
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:05,819
Okay, thanks.

1229
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:06,653
Bye.

1230
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:12,859
Terri says she hasn't seen Mom all day.

1231
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:16,709
What about Millie, you
didn't ask about Millie!

1232
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:18,169
I forgot, go ask your
own stupid questions.

1233
01:18:18,170 --> 01:18:20,369
Guys, guys, guys.

1234
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:21,203
That's enough.

1235
01:18:21,204 --> 01:18:22,219
I want you both to go upstairs

1236
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:23,742
and get ready for bed, go on now, go on.

1237
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,871
But what about Millie?

1238
01:18:25,872 --> 01:18:27,872
(sighs)

1239
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:30,454
Hey.

1240
01:18:31,314 --> 01:18:32,147
Come here.

1241
01:18:33,463 --> 01:18:35,444
I don't want any crying.

1242
01:18:35,445 --> 01:18:37,530
I want you to go upstairs

1243
01:18:37,531 --> 01:18:39,769
and I want you to put your jammies on

1244
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:41,579
and start getting ready

1245
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:42,413
and then I'll come up

1246
01:18:42,414 --> 01:18:44,810
and we'll say a prayer
for Millie together, okay?

1247
01:18:46,301 --> 01:18:48,293
Now go on, upstairs, right now.

1248
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:58,839
Alright your parents
are already at your house.

1249
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:00,206
As soon as Robert drops off the kids...

1250
01:19:00,207 --> 01:19:01,973
Why hasn't Robert paid the money?

1251
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,509
Well we think he's stalling,

1252
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:08,413
that he wants the police
to show him a body.

1253
01:19:10,818 --> 01:19:13,589
(Linda sighs)

1254
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:14,423
Okay look.

1255
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:18,699
Look, we can't show him a
body but I can make him think

1256
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:19,533
there's a body.

1257
01:19:20,690 --> 01:19:23,268
I'll go to his office, I'll talk to him.

1258
01:19:23,269 --> 01:19:24,739
Look, you can talk to him all you want

1259
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:26,513
but after he drops off the kids.

1260
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:29,739
'Cause Robert would love to
tell the kids that I'm dead

1261
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:32,163
and we can't put them through that.

1262
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:35,883
Okay.

1263
01:19:46,783 --> 01:19:49,866
Oh look, Grandpa and Grandma are here!

1264
01:19:49,867 --> 01:19:52,359
Hey Stephen, tell your
mother to come outside,

1265
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,360
I wanna talk to her.

1266
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:55,861
- Hey!
- Grandpa!

1267
01:19:55,862 --> 01:19:56,695
Stephen!

1268
01:19:56,695 --> 01:19:57,528
How are you, buddy?

1269
01:19:57,528 --> 01:19:58,361
Fine!

1270
01:19:58,361 --> 01:19:59,194
Oh you're getting so big!

1271
01:19:59,195 --> 01:20:01,130
- Hi there.
- Oh Grandma!

1272
01:20:01,131 --> 01:20:03,559
Grandma, where's Mama?

1273
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:06,056
How would you two like
some fresh yellow bread

1274
01:20:06,057 --> 01:20:08,256
- just out of the oven?
- Yeah!

1275
01:20:08,257 --> 01:20:10,424
Yay, okay, let's get it.

1276
01:20:27,307 --> 01:20:29,144
(sprinklers sputtering)

1277
01:20:29,145 --> 01:20:30,698
Oh.

1278
01:20:30,699 --> 01:20:34,086
(engine revving)

1279
01:20:34,087 --> 01:20:34,920
Damnit!

1280
01:20:41,139 --> 01:20:42,676
Have like 15 minutes.

1281
01:20:42,677 --> 01:20:44,759
The best we can
determine she disappeared

1282
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:45,747
sometime late Friday night.

1283
01:20:45,748 --> 01:20:47,349
Are you saying that you found blood

1284
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:48,449
on the seat of her car?

1285
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:50,339
Well we think it was blood.

1286
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:53,488
We can't be certain until
the lab results come in.

1287
01:20:53,489 --> 01:20:55,599
My client and his wife are in the middle

1288
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,379
of a rather acrimonious divorce.

1289
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:01,919
What I'm trying to decide is
if you're here to inform him

1290
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,273
or to interrogate him.

1291
01:21:04,451 --> 01:21:06,859
I'm just trying to
see if there's someone

1292
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:08,560
who can help us find Mrs. Edelman.

1293
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:12,239
Why has the FBI been called in on this?

1294
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:13,519
It's a formality.

1295
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,549
Her car was found across
a state line in Oklahoma.

1296
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:19,299
Well Mrs. Edelman's
parents live in Oklahoma.

1297
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:21,242
Yes, yes, I know, and
I've spoken to them,

1298
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:23,079
but unfortunately they haven't seen her

1299
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,063
or talked to her since sometime Friday.

1300
01:21:26,656 --> 01:21:28,073
Well I'm sorry.

1301
01:21:29,711 --> 01:21:32,159
Wish there was something
I could do to help.

1302
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,809
Well maybe there is.

1303
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:37,209
A Mr. Vandeneichal gave
me the name of a private

1304
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:39,939
investigator he had
hired, by any chance have

1305
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:41,340
either one of you hired one?

1306
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,263
No, we haven't.

1307
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:51,043
Well, just that you know
sometimes a private detective,

1308
01:21:51,044 --> 01:21:53,844
well, may have seen something
that would have helped us.

1309
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:57,999
If there's anything at all
that we can do to help you,

1310
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,223
you just give me a call.

1311
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,810
Why thank you, Mr.
Edelman, I appreciate that.

1312
01:22:03,811 --> 01:22:07,698
Thank you.

1313
01:22:07,699 --> 01:22:08,532
Thank you.

1314
01:22:16,919 --> 01:22:19,669
(birds chirping)

1315
01:22:30,226 --> 01:22:31,059
Hi.

1316
01:22:31,060 --> 01:22:33,149
I really wish you'd stay inside.

1317
01:22:33,150 --> 01:22:33,983
Is it over?

1318
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:36,230
We need to talk.

1319
01:22:37,697 --> 01:22:38,530
Where are the kids?

1320
01:22:38,531 --> 01:22:39,693
Oh the kids are fine.

1321
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:41,640
Fine.

1322
01:22:41,641 --> 01:22:43,850
Robert dropped them off this morning.

1323
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:47,009
Masterson went to Robert's office

1324
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:49,560
so Robert now knows that
you're officially missing.

1325
01:22:50,940 --> 01:22:52,813
So now Robert's gonna make the payoff.

1326
01:22:56,950 --> 01:22:59,099
Five minutes after
Masterson left his office,

1327
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,609
Robert started legal
action to get the children

1328
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:02,527
returned to him.

1329
01:23:04,227 --> 01:23:06,495
(tense music)

1330
01:23:06,496 --> 01:23:08,189
What does that mean?

1331
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:09,319
Well it just means that this whole thing

1332
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:10,153
is gonna take two or
three more days you know.

1333
01:23:10,154 --> 01:23:12,029
Oh no, in two or three more days

1334
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:13,549
my kids are gonna be back with Robert,

1335
01:23:13,550 --> 01:23:14,595
I'm not putting them
in that danger, no no.

1336
01:23:14,596 --> 01:23:15,429
Now Linda, slow down.

1337
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:17,729
See we don't even know if this case

1338
01:23:17,730 --> 01:23:19,099
will hold up in court against him.

1339
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,700
Well I'll take my chances.

1340
01:23:20,701 --> 01:23:21,769
We need you.

1341
01:23:21,770 --> 01:23:23,713
You've gotta give us some more time.

1342
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:28,079
- Tomorrow.
- That's not enough time.

1343
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:30,569
Tomorrow or I swear to
God I will walk into Dallas

1344
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:32,670
and I'll spit in Robert's eye, you got it?

1345
01:23:52,619 --> 01:23:55,452
(tires squealing)

1346
01:24:10,912 --> 01:24:13,579
(door knocking)

1347
01:24:16,294 --> 01:24:17,907
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1348
01:24:17,908 --> 01:24:19,333
How are the kids holding up?

1349
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:22,499
They're not.

1350
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:23,768
None of us are.

1351
01:24:23,769 --> 01:24:25,199
Okay John I want you to
take Virginia and the kids,

1352
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,639
get them in the motor home
and then I want you to follow

1353
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:30,149
the gray sedan that's parked
just down the street here.

1354
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:30,983
Where are we going?

1355
01:24:30,984 --> 01:24:33,029
Just, just do it, John.

1356
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:33,863
Right now.

1357
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:24,958
(suspenseful music)

1358
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:29,649
[Agent] Test, testing.

1359
01:25:29,650 --> 01:25:30,483
Okay try it now,

1360
01:25:30,483 --> 01:25:31,316
I've got some static.

1361
01:25:31,317 --> 01:25:34,569
Test, testing, test.

1362
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:35,649
Okay one more time, a little more.

1363
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:36,915
Testing, testing.

1364
01:25:36,916 --> 01:25:38,031
Okay, that's good.

1365
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:38,865
Good.

1366
01:25:38,866 --> 01:25:40,032
That's good.

1367
01:25:41,069 --> 01:25:42,888
Okay now when Edelman and Young get here,

1368
01:25:42,889 --> 01:25:45,169
try to get them to make
the payoff by the car,

1369
01:25:45,170 --> 01:25:46,419
that way we're right next to you.

1370
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:47,769
Okay, where are they now?

1371
01:25:47,770 --> 01:25:51,479
Well, the blue team has
Young about four miles away,

1372
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:53,459
Edelman left his house 30 minutes ago.

1373
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:54,509
Edelman better show, Joe.

1374
01:25:54,510 --> 01:25:56,119
Well, if Young gets here first

1375
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:56,953
you're gonna have to stall him, you know,

1376
01:25:56,954 --> 01:25:58,401
buy him some breakfast, anything,

1377
01:25:58,402 --> 01:25:59,559
we wanna try and take 'em down together.

1378
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:00,660
Alright, you got it.

1379
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:08,336
The second we hear
from Edelmen we move in.

1380
01:26:08,337 --> 01:26:11,337
(suspenseful music)

1381
01:26:22,743 --> 01:26:24,196
Somebody wanna wave to me

1382
01:26:24,197 --> 01:26:26,680
so I know this thing's still working?

1383
01:26:28,426 --> 01:26:29,759
[Jennifer] Hi.

1384
01:26:31,532 --> 01:26:33,282
Thank you Jennifer.

1385
01:26:34,775 --> 01:26:37,445
(clock ticking)

1386
01:26:37,446 --> 01:26:40,446
(suspenseful music)

1387
01:27:04,023 --> 01:27:05,809
Well here's half the
party, I don't see Edelman,

1388
01:27:05,810 --> 01:27:06,960
hope this guy's hungry.

1389
01:27:09,450 --> 01:27:11,409
Zack, we don't know where Edelman is.

1390
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:12,760
You're gonna have to stall.

1391
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:16,629
Yeah that's fine but just
don't leave me hanging,

1392
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:17,997
don't wait too long, Joe.

1393
01:27:20,315 --> 01:27:22,389
Hey hey hey hey hey.

1394
01:27:22,390 --> 01:27:24,902
Happy Tuesday, happy Tuesday.

1395
01:27:24,903 --> 01:27:27,603
Come on, let's go get
something to eat, I'm starving.

1396
01:27:32,909 --> 01:27:35,909
(suspenseful music)

1397
01:27:39,789 --> 01:27:42,789
(car door clatters)

1398
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:02,659
So what, so is this guy gonna show up

1399
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:05,019
or is he gonna stay the mystery man?

1400
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:07,329
[James] There's no mystery,
he had a big meeting today.

1401
01:28:07,330 --> 01:28:09,930
Oh a big meeting, yeah I
bet he had a big meeting.

1402
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:12,732
Yeah, thing you gotta understand is

1403
01:28:12,733 --> 01:28:14,629
you deal with me, you're dealing with him,

1404
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:15,698
it's the same thing.

1405
01:28:15,699 --> 01:28:16,532
Ah.

1406
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:20,629
Hey partner.

1407
01:28:20,630 --> 01:28:22,961
You act like you never dealt
with a middleman before.

1408
01:28:22,962 --> 01:28:23,896
(laughs)

1409
01:28:23,897 --> 01:28:25,678
What, you kidding me?

1410
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:29,245
What, I'm the ultimate middleman, man.

1411
01:28:29,246 --> 01:28:33,239
Just expecting to meet
this client face to face.

1412
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:34,073
Don't worry.

1413
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:35,793
I got the money.

1414
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:41,010
(suspenseful music)

1415
01:28:51,393 --> 01:28:53,359
Now tomorrow that stuff'll wait.

1416
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,929
That's very smart.

1417
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:56,459
I know a lot of guys
who have sell the trim,

1418
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:59,879
you know sell a watch or
credit cards, right, stupid.

1419
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:00,713
Let's go.

1420
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:03,573
Don't take him down, boy.

1421
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:06,543
Not yet.

1422
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:08,920
We need Edelman too.

1423
01:29:10,130 --> 01:29:13,130
(suspenseful music)

1424
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:17,616
(footsteps crackling)

1425
01:29:31,618 --> 01:29:34,559
Did you give Fred his finder's fee?

1426
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,643
I brought it with me, I
thought you could give it to him.

1427
01:29:37,644 --> 01:29:38,477
What are you doing, man?

1428
01:29:38,477 --> 01:29:39,310
Leave the envelope alone,

1429
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:40,143
wait til you get to the car.

1430
01:29:40,144 --> 01:29:41,289
Okay, okay.

1431
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:43,363
I'll have your second
5,000 for you in 30 days.

1432
01:29:43,364 --> 01:29:44,290
Good.

1433
01:29:44,291 --> 01:29:45,669
Our stuff's in here, don't look at it now,

1434
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:47,990
just leave the envelope in the trunk

1435
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:50,467
when you take the stuff.

1436
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:57,489
James Young you're under arrest

1437
01:29:57,490 --> 01:29:59,049
for conspiracy to commit murder.

1438
01:29:59,050 --> 01:29:59,883
What?

1439
01:29:59,883 --> 01:30:00,727
Now I'm gonna read you your rights

1440
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:03,223
and then you're gonna tell
me where Robert Edelman is.

1441
01:30:06,115 --> 01:30:09,115
(suspenseful music)

1442
01:30:19,702 --> 01:30:22,202
(door creaks)

1443
01:30:23,681 --> 01:30:26,681
(doorknob rattling)

1444
01:30:35,843 --> 01:30:37,209
Joe I just couldn't stall any longer.

1445
01:30:37,210 --> 01:30:38,260
Good job, good job.

1446
01:30:39,317 --> 01:30:42,349
Now just got the background
check on Mr. Young here.

1447
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:45,159
99% of his military career is a lie.

1448
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:45,993
What are you talking about?

1449
01:30:45,994 --> 01:30:49,459
He was never in Vietnam,
he was never a Green Beret,

1450
01:30:49,460 --> 01:30:51,489
he was never even in Korea.

1451
01:30:51,490 --> 01:30:52,719
He's a big time fake.

1452
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:54,829
And now I'm gonna stop talking

1453
01:30:54,830 --> 01:30:56,659
and you're gonna start talking.

1454
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:58,259
You're gonna tell me
everything you know about

1455
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:01,019
Mr. Edelman, aren't you?

1456
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:02,120
Aren't you, Mr. Young?

1457
01:31:03,295 --> 01:31:08,295
(suspenseful music)
(doorknob rattling)

1458
01:31:09,123 --> 01:31:11,790
(door knocking)

1459
01:31:18,092 --> 01:31:20,336
[Man] Mrs. Edelman?

1460
01:31:20,337 --> 01:31:21,197
Mrs. Edelman?

1461
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:25,129
If you're in there go to
the window near the door

1462
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:27,690
and I'll show you some identification.

1463
01:31:43,935 --> 01:31:46,059
Are you alright?

1464
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:47,583
Your children are just down the road.

1465
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,960
I'll radio them to come on through.

1466
01:31:54,813 --> 01:31:57,813
(suspenseful music)

1467
01:32:05,349 --> 01:32:07,097
Okay I want you two
guys to cover the front,

1468
01:32:07,098 --> 01:32:08,116
rest of you come with me.

1469
01:32:08,117 --> 01:32:10,689
Right, get inside, cover the elevators.

1470
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:12,273
- Right.
- Yes sir.

1471
01:32:18,073 --> 01:32:19,323
Mommy, Mommy!

1472
01:32:21,721 --> 01:32:22,554
Oh, oh!

1473
01:32:24,850 --> 01:32:27,342
Hi hon, how's the fishing?

1474
01:32:27,343 --> 01:32:28,980
Oh sis, I'm sorry, they
wouldn't let me tell you.

1475
01:32:28,981 --> 01:32:31,626
I know, I'm just so glad you're alive!

1476
01:32:31,627 --> 01:32:33,877
(laughing)

1477
01:32:35,032 --> 01:32:37,715
Excuse me, do you have an appointment?

1478
01:32:37,716 --> 01:32:39,584
Please sit down miss.

1479
01:32:39,585 --> 01:32:41,756
I'm gonna need to ask you a few questions.

1480
01:32:41,757 --> 01:32:43,469
Robert Edelman.

1481
01:32:43,470 --> 01:32:46,032
You're under arrest for
conspiracy to commit murder.

1482
01:32:46,033 --> 01:32:46,886
What the hell is this?

1483
01:32:46,887 --> 01:32:48,029
Leave your hands where we can see them

1484
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:49,569
and do exactly as you're told.

1485
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:51,439
You stand up please.

1486
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,899
You have the right to remain silent.

1487
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:53,733
Mona!

1488
01:32:53,733 --> 01:32:54,578
Anything you say may be used against you

1489
01:32:54,578 --> 01:32:55,411
in a court of law.

1490
01:32:55,412 --> 01:32:56,529
Mona, get Ken Fuller!

1491
01:32:56,530 --> 01:32:57,796
You have the right to a
lawyer and to have him present

1492
01:32:57,797 --> 01:32:58,630
(handcuffs click)

1493
01:32:58,631 --> 01:33:00,264
while any questioning takes place.

1494
01:33:00,265 --> 01:33:03,015
(dramatic music)

1495
01:33:04,438 --> 01:33:07,771
(police radio chatters)

1496
01:33:10,442 --> 01:33:12,025
Stay back please.

1497
01:33:14,769 --> 01:33:16,019
Stupid jerks.

1498
01:33:17,163 --> 01:33:19,299
I didn't kill my wife!

1499
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,539
No, you didn't.

1500
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:21,483
She's still alive.

1501
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:24,099
But you did conspire to have her killed.

1502
01:33:24,100 --> 01:33:26,359
Conspiracy to murder is a crime.

1503
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:28,089
The only thing we
don't know, Mr. Edelman,

1504
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:29,881
is how many years you're going away for.

1505
01:33:29,882 --> 01:33:30,825
- Get in the car.
- No, but...

1506
01:33:30,826 --> 01:33:32,194
Watch your head.

1507
01:33:32,195 --> 01:33:33,528
Watch your head.

1508
01:33:35,393 --> 01:33:38,143
- Let's go kids.
- Let's roll.

1509
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:43,324
(siren wailing)

1510
01:33:44,449 --> 01:33:47,415
(laughing and chattering)

1511
01:33:47,416 --> 01:33:49,999
You want some more ice cream?

1512
01:33:51,096 --> 01:33:53,096
- Hi mommy!
- I'm Mr. Ed!

1513
01:33:56,169 --> 01:33:59,085
Here you go kids, they're thirsty.

1514
01:33:59,086 --> 01:34:02,392
And there's the birthday boy.

1515
01:34:02,393 --> 01:34:04,045
Look Mom!

1516
01:34:04,046 --> 01:34:07,006
Hi honey, are you having a good time?

1517
01:34:07,007 --> 01:34:08,412
Happy birthday.

1518
01:34:08,413 --> 01:34:10,130
Where's your sister, Kathleen?

1519
01:34:10,131 --> 01:34:11,798
Oh over here Mama!

1520
01:34:12,692 --> 01:34:13,775
Hi sweetie.

1521
01:34:14,895 --> 01:34:16,473
Oh we're having a great time.

1522
01:34:16,474 --> 01:34:17,779
[Linda] Dad, Mom.

1523
01:34:17,780 --> 01:34:19,407
Hey, look at this.

1524
01:34:19,408 --> 01:34:20,509
(laughing)

1525
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:22,147
[Linda] Very good, so smooth.

1526
01:34:24,180 --> 01:34:26,543
Linda, look who's here!

1527
01:34:28,295 --> 01:34:29,466
Oh.

1528
01:34:29,467 --> 01:34:31,017
Hi, you're on video, say hello.

1529
01:34:32,871 --> 01:34:34,629
(laughs)

1530
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:35,969
See if you can get a picture
of the whole table, will you?

1531
01:34:35,970 --> 01:34:37,253
Okay, okay gang.

1532
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,498
So, how are you doing?

1533
01:34:41,499 --> 01:34:43,910
You tell me.

1534
01:34:43,911 --> 01:34:45,570
Is it over?

1535
01:34:45,571 --> 01:34:47,797
As of 10 o'clock this morning.

1536
01:34:47,798 --> 01:34:51,309
Robert's conviction on the
federal charges was upheld.

1537
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:53,388
And he's accepted the plea bargain.

1538
01:34:53,389 --> 01:34:54,360
(sighs)

1539
01:34:54,361 --> 01:34:56,596
He's given up all
rights to the children?

1540
01:34:56,597 --> 01:34:58,309
It's over.

1541
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:00,560
Your life can go back
to where it was before.

1542
01:35:02,050 --> 01:35:03,463
Oh no, I don't want that.

1543
01:35:05,133 --> 01:35:07,019
(uplifting music)

1544
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:07,873
That's behind us.

1545
01:35:10,329 --> 01:35:12,444
Why don't I get you some cake?

1546
01:35:12,445 --> 01:35:13,965
Thanks.

1547
01:35:13,966 --> 01:35:16,839
You know Robert's not
gonna be in jail forever.

1548
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:19,399
Well, there are two
things I can't worry about.

1549
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,502
One is yesterday and the other is forever.

1550
01:35:21,503 --> 01:35:22,779
Here you go.

1551
01:35:22,780 --> 01:35:23,613
Thanks.

1552
01:35:24,505 --> 01:35:25,723
No, thank you.

1553
01:35:26,817 --> 01:35:28,809
For everything.

1554
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:31,595
Well actually thanks to Fred Zabitosky.

1555
01:35:31,596 --> 01:35:35,136
Because if he hadn't called us...

1556
01:35:35,137 --> 01:35:38,404
Mommy, Millie threw up again.

1557
01:35:38,405 --> 01:35:39,712
(laughs)

1558
01:35:39,713 --> 01:35:42,074
Millie threw up again, what a surprise!

1559
01:35:42,075 --> 01:35:43,763
- That's our cat.
- Hmm.

1560
01:35:43,764 --> 01:35:45,450
Well, hi, Stephen.

1561
01:35:45,451 --> 01:35:46,615
Why thank you buddy.

1562
01:35:46,616 --> 01:35:47,794
Happy birthday.

1563
01:35:47,795 --> 01:35:48,795
Thank you.

1564
01:35:50,409 --> 01:35:51,472
Oh very nice.

1565
01:35:51,473 --> 01:35:52,578
(laughing)

1566
01:35:52,579 --> 01:35:54,996
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

1567
01:36:18,207 --> 01:36:20,957
(dramatic music)

1568
01:37:05,023 --> 01:37:07,606
(upbeat music)
