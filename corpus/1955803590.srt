1
00:00:02,462 --> 00:00:04,589
Life is about making decisions.

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,359
I suppose the ones taken from
me were the worst possible.

3
00:00:13,606 --> 00:00:16,302
I wish I could take the time back.

4
00:00:18,678 --> 00:00:19,474
No.

5
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,442
I want my life to be normal again

6
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:25,883
My name is Casey Benson...

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,653
and this year I graduated
from West Angus Gymnasium.

8
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:33,924
MONTH EARLY

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,074


10
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,608
- Hey, Case.
- Hey.

11
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:56,974
Can you look at me and tell me
if I have solved it properly?

12
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:03,349
y... x..4x... equals 5...

13
00:01:03,556 --> 00:01:04,545
Yes, it looks right!

14
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:07,021
Thank you! I really need
another six on algebra.

15
00:01:07,227 --> 00:01:08,660
Mother will kill me otherwise.

16
00:01:17,303 --> 00:01:22,434
GIRL WITH PERSPECTIVE
(way of life)

17
00:01:35,822 --> 00:01:38,518
Just tell you I hate them.

18
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:40,420
- Bye.
- Yes, until later.

19
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:50,297
- Jeremy!
- Oh, hello.

20
00:01:50,503 --> 00:01:52,368
How many hours are we going
to the shore tonight?

21
00:01:53,973 --> 00:01:57,807
Aahahm, see Casey, can
we talk for a moment?

22
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:02,646
What do you think of her?

23
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:06,344
- Too thick legs.
- It can happen.

24
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,517
Seriously?
Her hair is disgusting.

25
00:02:09,722 --> 00:02:12,282
- It's true.
"We can always paint her hair.

26
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:15,928
Yes, but we can not paint her face.
What's left?

27
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:18,826
Look, Casey.

28
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:22,361
I do not know how to tell you.
That's why I'll say it straight away.

29
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:29,103
You are a very precise girl,
but it will not happen to me.

30
00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:30,771
What?

31
00:02:30,977 --> 00:02:34,469
Well, we did understand to
be honest with each other.

32
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:37,081
- Yes.
"Well, I'm honest at the moment."

33
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,714
One kind... I like another.

34
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,409
Which?

35
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:43,521
She studies in Ven Westerly.

36
00:02:44,524 --> 00:02:49,086
"It does not matter, I'm sorry. Is everything alright?
- OK?

37
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:51,695
Yes, if you want to go out
with one of my friends...

38
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:54,492
- I will not mind.
- Coming out with your friends?

39
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:57,670
Yes. I just want to say
it will not bother me.

40
00:02:57,937 --> 00:02:59,768
Hey, Jeremy?

41
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:02,236
I have to go.

42
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:08,946
If you do not want this plush
'kimono' dragon I won for you...

43
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:11,378
I can give it to my
sister for her birthday.

44
00:03:12,752 --> 00:03:16,119
But if you want to keep it, there
are no problems. Whatever.

45
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,501
Hey, dumbass!
Do you want me to be honest?

46
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:35,372
Are we honest with each other?

47
00:03:36,075 --> 00:03:38,270
It's not 'kimino', it's comodo.

48
00:03:39,078 --> 00:03:41,444
And he did not win it.

49
00:03:41,648 --> 00:03:43,115
The man you gave him out of pity...

50
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:44,681
because it spent 36 $...

51
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:47,444
and yet you could not
even get a bottle.

52
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:51,345
I can buy the same
for $ 2 in Chinese.

53
00:03:59,966 --> 00:04:03,458
- It hurts me!
- Seriously? Casey Benson?

54
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:05,463
That dick?

55
00:04:05,672 --> 00:04:08,334
Yes. Simple at first glance.

56
00:04:09,676 --> 00:04:11,371
But there is a potential.

57
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:34,357
The previous owner has left.
pretty fast...

58
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:36,865
he left everything in the kitchen so
the equipment comes in the price.

59
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,435
Refrigerators are old.
We will have to change them.

60
00:04:38,638 --> 00:04:41,505
But everything else is in good condition.

61
00:04:42,141 --> 00:04:43,836
We can cover the deposit.

62
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:47,774
My Investor Confirmed
That Location Is Great...

63
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,948
The common room is exactly
what we wanted...

64
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:52,413
the kitchen is small.

65
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:56,284
Look, I'll take care of the bills...

66
00:04:56,489 --> 00:04:58,423
but everything here depends on you.

67
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,458
"Holly, if you do not like the place..."
- It's great.

68
00:05:04,864 --> 00:05:07,355
- Do you think?
- I adore him.

69
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:09,091
Great!

70
00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:14,636
"That really means we're starting, is not it?"
- Let's start.

71
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:19,340
Thank you.

72
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:29,512
- Hi, Casey!
- Hi, Amber. What's up?

73
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,585
Very cute blouse!

74
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:36,622
"Well, what are you thinking about doing this Friday?"
- I do not have plans anymore.

75
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,699
Taylor, Kylie and I will go to a club.
Do you want to join?

76
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:44,763
Do you want me to come with you?

77
00:05:45,405 --> 00:05:46,531
This is new.

78
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:49,606
Did not your cars get
damaged at the same time?

79
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:52,934
Wow! Problems with confidence I feel.
Lovely.

80
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:55,671
Have you ever been
to the Gold Bar?

81
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:58,846
Gold Bar? No.

82
00:05:59,051 --> 00:06:01,349
You must be 21 to enter,
and we are only 18.

83
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:02,987
It is!

84
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:06,283
That's why I must have arranged
a fake ID card for you...

85
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:09,825
and these things do not happen right away.

86
00:06:10,363 --> 00:06:12,331
Well? What would you say?
Are you with us?

87
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:16,630
- Come on, Casey, it'll be fun!
- I do not know.

88
00:06:17,437 --> 00:06:19,166
All right.
See what.

89
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:23,403
This is the e-mail sent
me a picture of you.

90
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:28,473
I'll send you the card
and see what happens.

91
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:30,772
Say when you decide.

92
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,608
All right.

93
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:37,251
What did he want?

94
00:06:37,457 --> 00:06:40,017
She asked if I wanted to go
with them to the Gold Bar.

95
00:06:40,226 --> 00:06:41,716
They'll make me a fake ID.

96
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:43,793
You are kidding!
Can he do one for me?

97
00:06:43,996 --> 00:06:45,486
I do not know if I'm going.

98
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:46,858
After Jeremy...

99
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,363
I'm not like guys.

100
00:06:48,568 --> 00:06:51,765
Forget Jeremy.
Does not deserve you!

101
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:54,863
Come on.

102
00:06:56,642 --> 00:06:59,440
Meggy talked to a
restaurant for a long time.

103
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:02,306
Should I call her to tell her
that you are not interested?

104
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:06,879
Meggy needs a business partner,
and I'll take the whole menu.

105
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:10,021
She needs an investor
this is all!

106
00:07:10,223 --> 00:07:12,316
We should not be her kind of ATM.

107
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:16,154
Not true! She did not
even ask me a penny!

108
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,795
Yeah right. Still, just wait!

109
00:07:18,998 --> 00:07:21,228
- I really want to participate.
- No way.

110
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:23,629
I will not let you
blow our savings...

111
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:25,201
for some idiotic
restaurant stupidity.

112
00:07:25,438 --> 00:07:26,666
- Christopher!
- No!

113
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:30,536
I decided to apply at Wittendale in the fall.
If anyone is interested.

114
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:33,644
Dear, this is great!
When did you decide?

115
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:35,541
- In the last few days.
- I am very happy.

116
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:38,148
I was hoping you'd be there.

117
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:42,286
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

118
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:45,683
My dear, I had the impression you
wanted to go to Cal State Northridge.

119
00:07:45,892 --> 00:07:47,587
I think.

120
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:50,224
Wittendale have the best
department in geology...

121
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,954
I think this is a
great solution!

122
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:55,998
Do you really want to move to
the other end of the country?

123
00:07:57,169 --> 00:07:58,898
Yes.

124
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:04,636
Can you excuse me?
I have a lot of work to do...

125
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:07,369
I have a lot of work on
this tattoo I will do.

126
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,048
Very funny!
Mila proud of you.

127
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:12,615
- Thanks.
- Me too.

128
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,160
"All right, what is it?"
- Nothing.

129
00:08:23,362 --> 00:08:25,091
We told her he could
go to Wittendale...

130
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:27,027
do you know how much effort
he made to go there?

131
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:29,463
That's why I do not
want Maggie and I...

132
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:32,069
to dig us up with your
restaurant business.

133
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:34,671
This has nothing to do
with the restaurant!

134
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:38,937
And thanks to him, I can help.

135
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:40,840
"Do you really believe him?"
- Yes.

136
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:43,277
do you know how long
it will take before...

137
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,313
to start recovering
if it ever starts?

138
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:48,385
No! You will work for no money and I
will be distorted to support you.

139
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:50,556
This is not true.
We have already secured an investor.

140
00:08:50,756 --> 00:08:51,780
We will not need money.

141
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:54,892
- I ended up with this conversation.
- All right, but I'm not.

142
00:08:58,364 --> 00:09:01,094
I have to call. Excuse me.

143
00:09:02,868 --> 00:09:04,426
Hold for a moment.

144
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:22,286
Hey, Amber is.
You know what to do.

145
00:09:23,923 --> 00:09:25,982
Hey, Amber. Casey is.

146
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:28,717
Look at your e-mail. I sent you the picture.

147
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:31,157
I'll see you on Friday.

148
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:47,940
4 Long Beach Ice Tea.

149
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:51,908
- How much do they cost?
- Casey, get out.

150
00:09:52,318 --> 00:09:55,617
I will pay the first,
and then take the boys.

151
00:09:56,455 --> 00:09:59,481
- The boys?
- First rule.

152
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:02,092
If you do not buy a drink
for the first 3 minutes...

153
00:10:02,294 --> 00:10:04,262
is not worth the attention.

154
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:07,830
Wait for you to meet Max and Roger.
They are well loaded.

155
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:22,940
Hey, Amber, my lovely one!

156
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:25,674
Max, that's Casey.

157
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:28,880
- Hi, Casey.
- Hello.

158
00:10:30,122 --> 00:10:33,489
- Girls already have drinks!
- Well, buy us shots.

159
00:10:33,693 --> 00:10:38,596
Awesome idea. six 'kamikaze',
please be cold as well.

160
00:11:08,728 --> 00:11:11,561
"One more, please.
- No, it's enough for me.

161
00:11:11,764 --> 00:11:14,665
No way!
I will not drink myself.

162
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,086
He was watching us.

163
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:20,022
That's right.

164
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:23,299
Did you like what you saw?

165
00:12:36,315 --> 00:12:38,476
Drink. You'll like.

166
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:47,118
Patricia approves of it.
- Who is Patricia?

167
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:50,762
She is the alcoholic
living in me.

168
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:55,462
"I've never met a girl like you."
- Me too.

169
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:24,420
- I have a question about you.
- Is it rhetorical?

170
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,530
Perhaps.

171
00:13:26,966 --> 00:13:32,768
Patricia likes to kiss
her before people...

172
00:13:32,972 --> 00:13:34,496
from a person who
has just met...

173
00:13:34,707 --> 00:13:37,505
and who, unbelievably, likes it?

174
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:45,378
I'm not sure about Patricia, but...

175
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:49,884
Casey would have liked it.

176
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,838
I told you it would
fit perfectly.

177
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,333
- At 18, is not it?
- Spock. I checked the ID card.

178
00:14:12,544 --> 00:14:14,102
It's all over.

179
00:14:14,313 --> 00:14:16,281
Kylie has a problem.

180
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,512
No, I was not kidding!

181
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:23,085
"I thought you were joking!"
"Do you seem to joke?"

182
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:25,621
No, but do you think I
can hear anything...

183
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:26,449
of that music?

184
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:27,819
Very well heard what I said!

185
00:14:28,027 --> 00:14:30,791
You know what? I'm getting away.
Hey, calmly get my hands off me.

186
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,793
- What is the problem?
- He does not want to pay.

187
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:34,795
Did not I know he
was a prostitute?

188
00:14:35,935 --> 00:14:39,393
Do not call it that.
500 bucks, fast.

189
00:14:39,605 --> 00:14:41,266
Dude I do not have that much money.

190
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:43,270
He did not have that much money.

191
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:53,080
He does not have that much money.

192
00:14:59,224 --> 00:15:00,851
If I see you around
my girls again...

193
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,722
I will tear you a throat.

194
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:06,625
- Have we got it?
- Yes.

195
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:15,267
Are you okay?

196
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:17,237
Kylie, I love you...

197
00:15:17,576 --> 00:15:19,806
but you have to let
me record customers.

198
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:22,139
I'm sorry, Jack.

199
00:15:22,815 --> 00:15:24,339
- Come on. Are you okay?
- Yes.

200
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,710
- Did he hurt you?
- No.

201
00:15:25,918 --> 00:15:27,545
I am fine.

202
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:49,136
God, I adore this song!

203
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:51,639
- Me too.
- Yeah right. -No, seriously!

204
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,780
Do you want to get out?

205
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:09,920
- All right.
- All right.

206
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,199
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

207
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,903
Oh, yeah, that's familiar to me.

208
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:57,132
It's good.
You can get used to it.

209
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:04,748
"What's your whole floor?"
- No, not exactly.

210
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:07,644
Nice and comfortable.

211
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,391
Oh, look.

212
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:19,060
There is a sushi restaurant...

213
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:21,596
and one more opposite.

214
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:25,227
"They're so close to each other.
- Allow me.

215
00:17:46,158 --> 00:17:49,025
- Wait.
- What's wrong?

216
00:17:49,228 --> 00:17:52,129
I do not...

217
00:17:53,298 --> 00:17:54,925
Nothing.

218
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,494
Casey?

219
00:18:56,695 --> 00:18:59,061
Do you know it's 1 at night?

220
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,391
I'm sorry.
I lost a sense of time.

221
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,500
Hold it.
Where have you gone tonight?

222
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:06,364
I told you. I went to a movie.

223
00:19:06,572 --> 00:19:10,440
- Did you?
"God, do you really need to
to make this conversation now?

224
00:19:10,642 --> 00:19:13,611
- I'm tired.
- Let's have it now!

225
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:17,373
If you are not too drunk
to have a conversation.

226
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,413
What's happening?

227
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:21,950
Casey just got back
half an hour ago...

228
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:24,145
and she's obviously got drunk.

229
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:25,823
I'm not drunk.

230
00:19:26,024 --> 00:19:28,788
What would happen if the
police had stopped you?

231
00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:30,086
Holly, calm down.

232
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,991
She did not stop her. She
said she was not drunk.

233
00:19:33,198 --> 00:19:34,028
Thanks.

234
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:36,224
Okay, do you smell it?

235
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:37,868
She made a small mistake.

236
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,367
Do you remember when
we were her age?

237
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:40,936
Will not be repeated.

238
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:45,872
Casey, I do not want
to talk again about...

239
00:19:46,078 --> 00:19:48,012
driving drunk, did we get it?

240
00:19:48,213 --> 00:19:50,181
- We agreed.
- All right, go to sleep.

241
00:19:50,382 --> 00:19:52,509
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night.

242
00:19:54,686 --> 00:19:57,951
Is this the message that
you want to get our girl?

243
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,818
That it is normal to lie to us...

244
00:20:01,026 --> 00:20:03,995
to miss the evening hours?

245
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:07,563
Honey, you have to be more relaxed.

246
00:20:52,344 --> 00:20:57,475
Little. Miss you.
I'll see you tomorrow.

247
00:21:00,352 --> 00:21:03,116
Holly really need to
relax as a whole.

248
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:07,349
- Who is she?
- What you mean?

249
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,789
You really need to check
your phone more often.

250
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:12,828
I have no idea what you're talking about.

251
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:17,398
She just said you missed her.

252
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:20,537
They must have confused the number.

253
00:21:20,939 --> 00:21:23,271
And why are you
looking at my phone?

254
00:21:23,475 --> 00:21:25,409
Do you have a mistress?

255
00:21:26,378 --> 00:21:29,905
- Do you have?
- No! I do not.

256
00:21:30,115 --> 00:21:31,707
Even if I had it,
would it matter?

257
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:35,512
It's not like we've had
something left lately.

258
00:21:41,793 --> 00:21:44,353
I can not believe
that such men exist!

259
00:21:44,563 --> 00:21:45,962
It's so cute and funny.

260
00:21:46,164 --> 00:21:48,496
I was going to give up
the men after Jeremy.

261
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,190
Mother dear!

262
00:21:50,402 --> 00:21:52,666
You can not compare idiots
from school with...

263
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:54,463
mature men.

264
00:21:54,806 --> 00:21:57,297
This is the difference
between low and high class.

265
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:00,203
It was the best
night in my life.

266
00:22:00,412 --> 00:22:02,676
Well, it's about to
become even better!

267
00:22:06,985 --> 00:22:11,046
- What is this?
- Your share of Max - $ 600.

268
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,782
Very funny.

269
00:22:13,992 --> 00:22:16,085
I will take them if you do not want to.

270
00:22:18,897 --> 00:22:22,890
You mean Max has paid to...

271
00:22:23,101 --> 00:22:24,591
Does that mean I'm a prostitute?

272
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:28,796
No, that makes you smart.
There is nothing wrong with what we do.

273
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:31,475
From which planet do you come from?
First, this is illegal.

274
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:33,735
And second I do not sleep
with men for money.

275
00:22:33,945 --> 00:22:37,711
Neither do we. Let's talk
with them because we want to.

276
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:40,783
Money is just a bonus.

277
00:22:40,986 --> 00:22:44,945
Casey, look around.
Look in the mirror.

278
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:48,649
We do it and we do not have
to apologize to anyone.

279
00:22:49,127 --> 00:22:51,288
We decide for ourselves with
whom to spend our time...

280
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:52,986
and with no one.

281
00:22:53,198 --> 00:22:57,032
But our attention is not free.
And they know it

282
00:22:57,502 --> 00:22:59,629
It's no different if he
brought you to dinner...

283
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:03,001
and took you a bottle
of champagne for $ 600.

284
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:07,008
The one difference is that it
gives you the money directly.

285
00:23:07,212 --> 00:23:11,308
Casey, do not think so much.
He's been doing great, you too.

286
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,848
All the above won a little money.

287
00:23:14,052 --> 00:23:15,849
Look, how many times did you sleep with Jeremy?

288
00:23:16,054 --> 00:23:20,047
And what do you get in return?
McDonoughs and Cinema?

289
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:23,794
Was that a kimono
dragon for two dollars?

290
00:23:23,995 --> 00:23:25,758
Please!

291
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:31,762
Casey where did he go?

292
00:23:35,474 --> 00:23:37,339
Will return.

293
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,681
I do not know what happened to us.

294
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,517
Before he was so funny,
loving and kind...

295
00:23:57,395 --> 00:24:01,525
But in recent years it has changed.
He is constantly angry and distant.

296
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,336
She started to work late, to go
somewhere without telling me.

297
00:24:06,738 --> 00:24:09,070
Well, what are you going to do?

298
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:11,071
What I had to do
a long time ago.

299
00:24:11,276 --> 00:24:13,005
I'll ask for a divorce.

300
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:14,576
I have a meeting with a lawyer...

301
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:16,838
tomorrow morning.

302
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:22,480
I'm afraid to tell him.

303
00:24:23,154 --> 00:24:26,715
You will tell me if you need something, do not you?
You can count on me.

304
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:30,918
Thank you, I can handle it.

305
00:24:34,232 --> 00:24:38,066
Before you tell him anything...

306
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:40,534
look at your property, bank
accounts, such things.

307
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:41,728
Why?

308
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,306
When my sister divorced...

309
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:48,206
her husband emptied all their
savings and hid them from her.

310
00:24:48,413 --> 00:24:50,813
It was a complete mess.

311
00:24:57,255 --> 00:25:00,918
- Hey.
- I'm not a prostitute.

312
00:25:01,326 --> 00:25:02,418
All right.

313
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:03,855
All the nonsense
that he told me...

314
00:25:04,062 --> 00:25:06,530
that I am smart and
beautiful and unique?

315
00:25:06,731 --> 00:25:09,291
Why did you ever bother,
you paid for everything?

316
00:25:09,568 --> 00:25:11,661
I told them because I
really thought them.

317
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,633
Yeah right.
You are a false bastard! Walk on...

318
00:25:13,838 --> 00:25:16,568
Hey, Casey. Stop, can you
at least listen to me?

319
00:25:16,775 --> 00:25:18,675
It was incredible last night.

320
00:25:18,877 --> 00:25:21,937
I really love you too.

321
00:25:22,147 --> 00:25:27,084
I think you're
smart, sexy, fun...

322
00:25:27,953 --> 00:25:31,252
I do not want to stop seeing.

323
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,324
If you feel bad
about the money...

324
00:25:35,794 --> 00:25:37,694
do not take them.

325
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,593
I thought you defined
the conditions.

326
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,096
And I thought you were frank.

327
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:42,925
I guess we're wrong.

328
00:25:43,134 --> 00:25:45,534
Please do not.
wait...

329
00:25:45,737 --> 00:25:47,136
If you do not want to see
more, that's your right.

330
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:50,274
You can just leave and
never look at me again...

331
00:25:51,643 --> 00:25:54,339
But I really hope you
make another decision...

332
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:56,981
because next week I come
back to town again...

333
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:59,275
and I'm glad to get out together...

334
00:25:59,818 --> 00:26:01,877
in some nice place.

335
00:26:03,088 --> 00:26:05,056
What would you say?

336
00:26:07,425 --> 00:26:08,551
We will see.

337
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,785
So we will see.

338
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:24,232
I have something for you.

339
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:32,641
Do you remember the song
from the club you like?

340
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:34,546
I called a friend of
mine this morning.

341
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,277
He is a promoter...

342
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,752
- These are third-order!
- Yes.

343
00:26:41,993 --> 00:26:43,426
I was thinking to give
it to you next week,

344
00:26:43,628 --> 00:26:47,655
but when I was surprised
so pleasantly...

345
00:26:49,668 --> 00:26:53,934
- Wow, thank you!
- You're welcome.

346
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:57,207
- Until next week?
- We will see.

347
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:59,673
I will help you.

348
00:27:33,878 --> 00:27:37,974
AVAILABILITY PER ACCOUNT: 0.00 $

349
00:27:53,164 --> 00:27:55,462
There is nothing wrong
with what we do.

350
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,658
If you feel bad
about the money...

351
00:27:58,837 --> 00:28:00,464
do not take them.

352
00:28:00,672 --> 00:28:02,537
Casey, do not think so much.

353
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:04,436
You both spent great.

354
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:06,439
All the above won a little
money during that time.

355
00:28:14,953 --> 00:28:17,046
Really?

356
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:19,790
Hey, Max. Is everything alright?

357
00:28:19,991 --> 00:28:22,459
Actually not.
Casey came to the hotel this morning...

358
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,854
and gave me the money back.

359
00:28:24,062 --> 00:28:25,495
What has she done?

360
00:28:25,697 --> 00:28:27,494
He told me he was
not a prostitute.

361
00:28:27,699 --> 00:28:29,792
Jack, I'm not sure
what you're doing.

362
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:34,700
It was not very cool.
I'm sorry it happened, man.

363
00:28:34,906 --> 00:28:36,464
Will not be repeated.

364
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:41,202
Look, I do not want to get her into trouble.
I really like it very much.

365
00:28:41,412 --> 00:28:42,970
It's okay, I understand.

366
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:45,306
We have to be discreet.
Right?

367
00:28:45,517 --> 00:28:47,712
Sometimes I come with
clients at this hotel.

368
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,012
Max, calm down, is not it?

369
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:52,485
We'll fix things.
There is nothing to worry about.

370
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,622
Well then.

371
00:28:53,825 --> 00:28:56,885
A light path and I'll
see you next week.

372
00:28:57,262 --> 00:28:58,729
Well then.

373
00:28:59,998 --> 00:29:02,330
Max is one of my most
profound clients, Amber.

374
00:29:02,534 --> 00:29:04,764
She was new, she did not know.

375
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:06,869
Yeah, maybe you had to
explain it to her...

376
00:29:07,071 --> 00:29:09,403
before taking it with you.

377
00:29:12,911 --> 00:29:14,776
Jack, wait! Do not.

378
00:29:14,979 --> 00:29:18,415
Let me talk to her.

379
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,582
He's going to talk, Amber!

380
00:29:21,786 --> 00:29:24,812
I promise. There is no.
I know her.

381
00:29:26,658 --> 00:29:28,455
It would be best not to.

382
00:29:29,794 --> 00:29:31,694
She's your girl.

383
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:36,057
If you do not take care
of that, I'll do it.

384
00:30:05,697 --> 00:30:07,688
Hello.

385
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:10,628
Hi, I wanted to talk about something.

386
00:30:10,835 --> 00:30:14,396
I was like a full-blown last
night and I'm very sorry.

387
00:30:14,606 --> 00:30:16,767
How was your day?

388
00:30:21,579 --> 00:30:23,240
Not very well.

389
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:25,143
What happened?

390
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:28,552
I checked our bank
account and found this.

391
00:30:30,755 --> 00:30:32,723
And?

392
00:30:32,924 --> 00:30:37,020
Our accounts are empty.
What happened to our money?

393
00:30:37,228 --> 00:30:39,059
I moved them.

394
00:30:40,265 --> 00:30:42,597
How did you move them?

395
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:46,160
I've been dealing with our
finances for 20 years.

396
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:50,239
You never asked me.
And suddenly this curious.

397
00:30:57,982 --> 00:30:59,711
Because these are not just your money.
These are our money...

398
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:02,512
the money we saved...

399
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,880
for the University of Casey.

400
00:31:04,088 --> 00:31:07,649
Exactly.
That's why I invested them.

401
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,289
What did you invest in?

402
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:13,555
Walter, he told me about a deal...

403
00:31:13,765 --> 00:31:15,699
with which he killed the fish some time ago.

404
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,834
And I did the same.

405
00:31:18,036 --> 00:31:21,130
Have you put our money
on a risky exchange?

406
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:22,931
Can we download them?

407
00:31:23,141 --> 00:31:25,336
It's not risky.
For hedges it's...

408
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:28,034
and yes, we can pull them, but
there will be penalties...

409
00:31:28,246 --> 00:31:29,213
we just have to wait a little while.

410
00:31:29,414 --> 00:31:32,406
If we wait, however, we will
regain our input many times.

411
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:37,013
Do you mean that our
money is virtually gone?

412
00:31:37,221 --> 00:31:39,815
Our money is not gone.

413
00:31:40,224 --> 00:31:43,625
Look at one is cheating on me.

414
00:31:43,828 --> 00:31:47,320
It is another thing to ruin
our daughter's future.

415
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,898
Holly, would you quit?
You do not know what you're talking about.

416
00:31:50,101 --> 00:31:52,228
You know? I've been thinking
about it for some time...

417
00:31:52,437 --> 00:31:55,304
I can not go any further.

418
00:31:56,774 --> 00:31:59,607
I want a divorce.

419
00:31:59,811 --> 00:32:06,740
You know our marriage has not
been going on for a long time.

420
00:32:06,951 --> 00:32:11,752
- You serious?
- Yes.

421
00:32:12,857 --> 00:32:15,917
Do you want to divorce?

422
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:17,692
And I think you have to go out.

423
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:18,589
Right?

424
00:32:18,796 --> 00:32:21,287
Just by way of the case...

425
00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:23,330
I think it's going to be
much easier for Casey.

426
00:32:23,534 --> 00:32:25,434
Do you think I have to
get out of my house?

427
00:32:25,636 --> 00:32:28,002
The house I've been
paying for 20 years...

428
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:30,197
to have a roof over
your head and Casey?

429
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:31,432
Do not you go mad?

430
00:32:31,642 --> 00:32:35,237
At the end, lawyers will
decide who will get the house.

431
00:32:35,446 --> 00:32:37,846
Just for the moment it will be best.

432
00:32:38,049 --> 00:32:40,711
You are the most self-centered, self-interested...

433
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:44,718
And you'll take care of
University Cash for Casey.

434
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:46,412
19 years.

435
00:32:46,624 --> 00:32:48,990
All he did was get you.

436
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:50,854
And now do you want me to move?

437
00:32:51,062 --> 00:32:52,120
You are the one to move.

438
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:52,853
Not so!

439
00:32:53,064 --> 00:32:54,497
You are the one who thinks
it's too good for me

440
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:56,633
Why do not you move, huh?
Just get out of here

441
00:32:56,834 --> 00:32:59,302
- Christopher, stop.
- What? What to stop!

442
00:32:59,504 --> 00:33:01,131
Stop it!

443
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:05,803
I'm sorry!

444
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:24,186
Holly, I'm sorry!
I did not want.

445
00:34:23,387 --> 00:34:24,376
Dad?

446
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:26,022
- All right, sweetheart.
- What's happening?

447
00:34:26,224 --> 00:34:28,124
Everything is fine.
I promise, just go home.

448
00:34:28,326 --> 00:34:29,554
Where do you lead him?

449
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,886
I promise, everything is fine.

450
00:34:31,095 --> 00:34:33,529
Hey, I'm talking to you!
Why are you taking him?

451
00:34:33,731 --> 00:34:36,393
Everything is fine. I promise.

452
00:34:38,102 --> 00:34:39,296
Mom, what's up?

453
00:34:39,504 --> 00:34:43,099
What the hell is going on here?

454
00:34:53,484 --> 00:34:57,011
- Casey, your father hit me.
- What?

455
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:00,485
My God.

456
00:35:00,691 --> 00:35:04,718
We scrambled and he lost
his own self-control.

457
00:35:04,929 --> 00:35:07,193
How did you crack?

458
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:08,554
Is it for me?

459
00:35:08,766 --> 00:35:10,233
Because I was late that night?

460
00:35:10,434 --> 00:35:13,494
- No, no, no.
"What then?"

461
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:20,504
Come here.

462
00:35:26,284 --> 00:35:29,310
I asked your father for a divorce.

463
00:35:30,121 --> 00:35:32,021
I would wait until you finished...

464
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:36,023
I can not do it anymore.

465
00:35:36,294 --> 00:35:38,785
I'm sure Dad is sorry
for what he's doing.

466
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:40,258
Did you try to fix
things between you?

467
00:35:40,464 --> 00:35:42,056
Just...

468
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,761
It's too late now.

469
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:47,200
Right?

470
00:35:47,405 --> 00:35:48,599
Is it too late...

471
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:51,366
for two people who
said they loved...

472
00:35:51,576 --> 00:35:56,570
and have they muttered to each other,
to dare to quarrel constantly?

473
00:35:56,781 --> 00:36:00,239
Mile is not that simple.
Trust me. I tried.

474
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:03,750
I tried as much as I could.

475
00:36:04,422 --> 00:36:06,720
Is it true?

476
00:36:07,725 --> 00:36:09,852
I do not think you want a divorce...

477
00:36:10,061 --> 00:36:13,360
- It's like having tried enough.
- Your father has a mistress...

478
00:36:13,931 --> 00:36:15,694
and I know I should not tell you, but...

479
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,334
he has withdrawn almost
all of our savings.

480
00:36:18,603 --> 00:36:21,299
He has put them in
some bad investment.

481
00:36:21,906 --> 00:36:24,898
You mean we have nothing left?

482
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:27,043
I'll take care of us.
I promise.

483
00:36:27,245 --> 00:36:30,408
How, Mom?
How do you make sure...

484
00:36:30,615 --> 00:36:33,106
sending dad to prison?

485
00:36:33,317 --> 00:36:36,616
"I suppose you enjoyed it."
- Not so.

486
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:38,345
You know this is not true.

487
00:36:38,556 --> 00:36:40,581
Okay, he hit you.
This is terrible.

488
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:43,487
Did you really have
to call the police?

489
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:49,891
No, but you wanted to humiliate him
in front of all our neighbors, right?

490
00:36:50,568 --> 00:36:52,297
I'm getting out of here.

491
00:37:00,111 --> 00:37:01,772
Vodka with soda.

492
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:15,519
Who is she? Is it from yours?

493
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:24,326
Yes. Excuse me.

494
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:26,670
Yes.

495
00:37:35,813 --> 00:37:38,008
Why is she here?

496
00:37:38,816 --> 00:37:41,580
- How would I know?
"Better have no trouble with her."

497
00:37:41,786 --> 00:37:44,516
I do not want the Princess
to fuck our business.

498
00:37:44,722 --> 00:37:47,885
Relax. He must be here to work.

499
00:37:48,092 --> 00:37:49,423
I want to be sure in that case.

500
00:37:49,627 --> 00:37:52,619
I have a client ready
so go and find out.

501
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:56,288
- All right, after a while.
- Immediately!

502
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,107
Cheers!

503
00:38:12,183 --> 00:38:13,616
You want something to drink.
Bartender?

504
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:16,480
No no. That's enough for me.
Are you okay?

505
00:38:16,687 --> 00:38:21,351
Great! My dad is in the dungeon.
My mother wants a divorce...

506
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:24,119
and I find that my
family is falling apart.

507
00:38:24,328 --> 00:38:25,818
How was your day?

508
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,622
You are kidding.

509
00:38:27,832 --> 00:38:29,732
I do not want to go
to university anyway.

510
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:32,459
The only reason I get
excellent grades...

511
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:35,332
was to go to study
geodesy and ecology.

512
00:38:35,539 --> 00:38:37,803
Casey, I'm so sorry.

513
00:38:38,142 --> 00:38:40,576
You will not do something
stupid now, will you?

514
00:38:41,245 --> 00:38:44,578
No. I need a rest.
That is all.

515
00:38:45,316 --> 00:38:49,844
Well, was there time to think
about our conversation?

516
00:38:51,355 --> 00:38:53,516
And?

517
00:38:53,724 --> 00:38:57,182
And, I really wish I had not
returned Max's money...

518
00:38:57,395 --> 00:38:59,363
especially after all
that has happened today.

519
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,324
Listen, Casey.

520
00:39:00,531 --> 00:39:03,329
I'm not a finance expert,
but I know this:

521
00:39:04,201 --> 00:39:07,534
I can work from $ 500 to $ 2000
for one night.

522
00:39:07,738 --> 00:39:11,606
On more busy weekends I can bring
them up to 6 grand! It's easy.

523
00:39:11,942 --> 00:39:14,877
I will never have to
think of money anymore.

524
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,214
Neither do you.

525
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:29,121
How much do I owe you?

526
00:39:31,462 --> 00:39:34,158
The girl in purple, do you like it?

527
00:39:34,532 --> 00:39:37,296
How long is it all night?

528
00:39:38,102 --> 00:39:40,332
2 grand.

529
00:39:42,072 --> 00:39:44,666
1 and 500.

530
00:39:48,612 --> 00:39:51,979
Okay, well two sounds decent.

531
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:08,194
Case?

532
00:40:08,399 --> 00:40:09,957
Do you see that guy there?

533
00:40:10,167 --> 00:40:14,035
Ready to pay 1200
overnight with you.

534
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,498
I think he explicitly wants you.

535
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:20,670
The decision is yours.
Up to you.

536
00:40:24,315 --> 00:40:27,250
It looks like Jeremy
plus 10 years.

537
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:31,251
Two more vodka with soda, and
I'll look like Bradley Cooper.

538
00:42:53,464 --> 00:42:54,522
Where were you?

539
00:42:54,732 --> 00:42:57,064
Good morning to you too!
Do we have aspirin?

540
00:42:57,267 --> 00:43:01,203
- I called you all night.
- I know. That's why I put out my phone.

541
00:43:01,405 --> 00:43:04,772
I was scared of worry!
Just to call the police!

542
00:43:04,975 --> 00:43:07,273
Right?
Why should they close me?

543
00:43:07,478 --> 00:43:09,070
Okay, I do not deserve such an attitude.

544
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:11,474
Neither am I. I am 18.

545
00:43:11,682 --> 00:43:12,774
I can stay out all
night if I want to.

546
00:43:12,983 --> 00:43:14,712
Casey!

547
00:43:18,822 --> 00:43:20,517
"Where did you get that money?"
- It is not your business.

548
00:43:20,724 --> 00:43:24,023
Who gave you that?
Casey?

549
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:28,164
Father! He gave it to me.
Ask me not to tell you.

550
00:43:28,365 --> 00:43:30,595
And how long has your father
been giving you so much money?

551
00:43:30,801 --> 00:43:33,429
From a week ago he went to jail.

552
00:43:34,938 --> 00:43:37,634
Take half.
They're actually yours.

553
00:43:48,385 --> 00:43:50,478
What do you think of this?

554
00:43:50,954 --> 00:43:52,353
I want her!

555
00:43:57,461 --> 00:43:59,361
I adore her.

556
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:54,715
$ 900.

557
00:45:15,038 --> 00:45:16,369
I love this dress.

558
00:45:16,573 --> 00:45:17,335
In that case, it brings it...

559
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:19,839
I think he'll be right
with these shoes.

560
00:45:20,043 --> 00:45:22,011
When was she last
shopping for her?

561
00:45:22,212 --> 00:45:25,648
This is the cop, Jack.
Our work is broken.

562
00:45:25,983 --> 00:45:27,041
Seriously!
It's coming.

563
00:45:27,251 --> 00:45:28,878
- Good evening ladies.
- Hello.

564
00:45:29,086 --> 00:45:29,882
- Hey.
- Hey.

565
00:45:30,087 --> 00:45:32,078
You seem to have gone through
all the shops in the mall.

566
00:45:32,289 --> 00:45:34,917
Hello dear. How are you?

567
00:45:36,393 --> 00:45:38,987
I'm better now.
May I sit?

568
00:45:39,196 --> 00:45:41,824
Casey, it's time
to meet the boss.

569
00:45:42,032 --> 00:45:43,556
You know Officer Jack, are not you?

570
00:45:43,767 --> 00:45:46,235
From school, yes, hi.

571
00:45:47,404 --> 00:45:49,065
Hello. It's a little weird, huh?

572
00:45:49,273 --> 00:45:50,865
It can be said.

573
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:54,371
Jack introduces us
to the men we meet.

574
00:45:57,848 --> 00:45:59,816
When asked...

575
00:46:00,017 --> 00:46:02,485
what are you going to do this Wednesday?

576
00:46:02,786 --> 00:46:04,276
We have a school activity.

577
00:46:04,488 --> 00:46:07,184
We have a client that I
think will interest you.

578
00:46:07,391 --> 00:46:10,258
A Hollywood actor, by the
late 20's, is very sweet.

579
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,485
We call it Valentino.

580
00:46:12,696 --> 00:46:14,926
No way!
Did he return?

581
00:46:15,132 --> 00:46:18,295
God, Casey, you have to see it.
It's wonderful.

582
00:46:18,502 --> 00:46:22,302
And let's say he gives
as much as you give him.

583
00:46:23,473 --> 00:46:26,704
Hey, Taylor. Where have you been?

584
00:46:27,311 --> 00:46:31,145
Put a nose on my nose. Why?

585
00:46:31,348 --> 00:46:33,612
Give me your prowess.

586
00:46:33,817 --> 00:46:36,047
Your prowl, right away!

587
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:38,551
Okay, here we are again.

588
00:46:44,061 --> 00:46:46,689
I told you to leave this shit.

589
00:46:47,364 --> 00:46:51,027
What are you going to do?
Will you arrest me?

590
00:46:55,005 --> 00:46:59,965
No. I'm just not going to
write you for more work.

591
00:47:00,277 --> 00:47:02,973
It looks like you do not
need that much money, huh?

592
00:47:04,414 --> 00:47:07,872
I'm sorry. I'll get them out.

593
00:47:08,085 --> 00:47:09,575
You know the rules.
Our scrambling is 'clean'.

594
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:12,152
Well well. God.

595
00:47:13,357 --> 00:47:15,120
What are you going to order?

596
00:47:15,325 --> 00:47:17,122
Amber, would you like
to divide a salad?

597
00:47:17,327 --> 00:47:18,453
Why not.

598
00:47:18,662 --> 00:47:21,859
Casey, I saw your father's file.

599
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:24,900
I'm sorry you need
to go through this.

600
00:47:25,202 --> 00:47:27,534
Tomorrow they'll probably release him.

601
00:47:28,305 --> 00:47:30,796
I think I'm going to get a taco.

602
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:35,668
How long have you been a pimp?

603
00:47:42,219 --> 00:47:46,315
I prefer the word 'manager'.

604
00:47:46,523 --> 00:47:49,492
- Manager, sorry.
- No problem.

605
00:47:49,693 --> 00:47:54,323
What exactly does the manager do
in an industry like this one?

606
00:47:54,965 --> 00:47:56,694
Well, Casey...

607
00:47:58,268 --> 00:48:03,262
I carefully select
the people you meet.

608
00:48:03,473 --> 00:48:05,600
And what do you win?

609
00:48:07,144 --> 00:48:09,772
A fair question is, is not it?

610
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,711
- No?
- Yes, it is.

611
00:48:14,618 --> 00:48:18,247
My profit varies.
Sometimes it is 20%, sometimes it is more.

612
00:48:18,455 --> 00:48:19,922
Depends on customer.

613
00:48:20,123 --> 00:48:23,024
Do not worry.
You do more than I do.

614
00:48:25,329 --> 00:48:30,062
There is a logic, yet we do
more than you do, do not we?

615
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,003
Wow, look at yourself!
I just knew you.

616
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:41,177
Hey.

617
00:48:41,378 --> 00:48:44,245
Where have you been?
I have not seen you forever!

618
00:48:45,315 --> 00:48:47,476
You know...

619
00:48:47,684 --> 00:48:52,383
Talk to Amber?
About the ID card?

620
00:48:53,957 --> 00:48:57,256
Come on, Casey! You know I'm also
going to go to the Gold Bar.

621
00:48:57,461 --> 00:48:58,553
You do not have to go there.

622
00:48:58,762 --> 00:49:01,162
What? Why not?

623
00:49:01,365 --> 00:49:03,230
You do not have to go there.

624
00:49:03,567 --> 00:49:06,195
And what does that mean?

625
00:49:07,004 --> 00:49:08,995
I'll see you in class.

626
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:12,130
What does that mean, Casey?

627
00:49:17,014 --> 00:49:20,677
It's getting bigger. That's disgusting!
What would Jack say?

628
00:49:20,884 --> 00:49:24,183
Nothing. Just get out in a few days and...

629
00:49:24,621 --> 00:49:27,454
take that, it should help.

630
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:30,419
For now.
This time it was at least number one.

631
00:49:30,627 --> 00:49:32,686
Number two is
disgusting, believe me.

632
00:49:32,896 --> 00:49:36,525
Taylor, shut up.
You will be OK.

633
00:51:35,485 --> 00:51:36,884
One moment.

634
00:51:41,258 --> 00:51:43,783
Excuse me. I have a quick question.
It `s urgent.

635
00:51:43,994 --> 00:51:45,256
A girl just came in here.

636
00:51:45,462 --> 00:51:46,520
Blonde, so high.

637
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:48,891
He wore a black coat and high heels.

638
00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:50,066
Can you tell me where he went?

639
00:51:50,267 --> 00:51:51,859
We do not provide such information,...

640
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:55,731
and I do not follow anyone
who goes through the lobby.

641
00:51:57,941 --> 00:51:59,033
Hello.

642
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:00,231
Hello.

643
00:52:00,443 --> 00:52:02,434
Please, please, do this to me.

644
00:52:02,646 --> 00:52:03,806
This girl is my daughter.

645
00:52:04,014 --> 00:52:07,472
If you wanted to know where he was
going, he would probably tell you.

646
00:52:07,684 --> 00:52:09,117
I'm sorry, ma'am, but
I can not help you.

647
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:11,947
Would you listen to me? Baxter!

648
00:52:12,155 --> 00:52:16,216
My daughter just came here,
looking like a whore!

649
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:19,054
I'm afraid something really
bad can happen to her...

650
00:52:19,262 --> 00:52:21,560
if I do not find it.

651
00:52:21,798 --> 00:52:23,288
Madam, this is a first class hotel...

652
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,866
we have a duty to keep our
customers confidential.

653
00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:29,630
If they want to spend their evening
in the company of a young lady...

654
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,306
this is their job.

655
00:52:31,508 --> 00:52:32,475
Wait a minute.
What are you trying to say?

656
00:52:32,676 --> 00:52:35,167
I say this is not her
first stay here.

657
00:52:35,378 --> 00:52:39,144
It seems like the type of person
who can take care of himself.

658
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:43,080
I will now ask you to address
your personal problems elsewhere.

659
00:52:43,286 --> 00:52:45,151
This is my only child!

660
00:52:45,355 --> 00:52:48,290
She's in high school, damn it!

661
00:52:48,725 --> 00:52:53,594
Madam, if you do not calm down,
I'll have to call the guards.

662
00:53:19,122 --> 00:53:21,283
What are you doing here?

663
00:53:21,491 --> 00:53:22,583
Are you following me?

664
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:25,784
What have you been doing
for the last 3 hours?

665
00:53:25,996 --> 00:53:28,590
And no more lies!
Why did you come here?

666
00:53:28,798 --> 00:53:30,595
I went to a party.

667
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:34,258
The receptionist hinted
that you had come before.

668
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:35,870
He's told the truth. I've come.

669
00:53:36,072 --> 00:53:38,131
Many people are doing coupons here.

670
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:39,137
Casey, dear...

671
00:53:39,342 --> 00:53:41,902
if you got involved in something
you can not get out of...

672
00:53:42,112 --> 00:53:44,876
- I'm not!
- Who's Max?

673
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:49,915
I saw your calendar and
saw the $ 900 tickets.

674
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,953
Are you in my stuff?
I can not believe!

675
00:53:53,156 --> 00:53:56,592
Please tell me the truth!

676
00:53:56,793 --> 00:53:57,782
Max has given you that money.

677
00:53:57,994 --> 00:54:01,486
OK! Fine. Yes. Max gave me the
money and tickets for the concert.

678
00:54:01,698 --> 00:54:04,428
Are you happy? They are gifts.

679
00:54:05,168 --> 00:54:08,604
- Max and I love each other.
- All right. How old is Max?

680
00:54:08,805 --> 00:54:10,796
On 28.

681
00:54:11,007 --> 00:54:13,567
"And where did you meet?"
- God!

682
00:54:13,777 --> 00:54:16,211
Casey! Max should not
go out with someone...

683
00:54:16,413 --> 00:54:19,177
who has not yet graduated from high school!
Do not you understand?

684
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:21,373
Mom, you have no idea what
you're talking about.

685
00:54:21,584 --> 00:54:23,279
You can not tell
me what to do now.

686
00:54:23,486 --> 00:54:28,389
Yes I can! I am still your mother,
and you still see me under my roof.

687
00:54:28,591 --> 00:54:30,889
This is about to change.
Move out.

688
00:54:31,094 --> 00:54:34,120
- What did you say?
- Goodbye. Stop watching me.

689
00:54:34,297 --> 00:54:36,561
Casey, do not be ridiculous.

690
00:54:36,966 --> 00:54:39,127
Where are you going to go?

691
00:54:48,278 --> 00:54:51,213
- Hello.
- Hello I am.

692
00:54:51,414 --> 00:54:54,679
Casey, what time is it?

693
00:54:54,884 --> 00:54:56,909
I have no idea.

694
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,315
God, it's three and a half in the morning.
Are you okay?

695
00:54:59,522 --> 00:55:01,456
Yes, I'm fine.

696
00:55:01,825 --> 00:55:05,488
I will not stay
with Mommy anymore.

697
00:55:05,695 --> 00:55:07,993
Welcome to the group.

698
00:55:08,365 --> 00:55:11,459
Look, dear, I'm sorry I did not call.

699
00:55:12,168 --> 00:55:14,466
I was trying to decide what I would do.

700
00:55:14,671 --> 00:55:17,606
Look, Dad.
I need a favor.

701
00:55:17,807 --> 00:55:19,069
19 years.

702
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:22,108
19 years I work for you child.

703
00:55:22,312 --> 00:55:25,145
I gave her every
penny, everything.

704
00:55:25,348 --> 00:55:26,178
And how does he thank me?

705
00:55:26,383 --> 00:55:27,941
They call the police
to put me in jail.

706
00:55:28,151 --> 00:55:29,482
Father?

707
00:55:29,686 --> 00:55:32,678
He must have told you I hit her.

708
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:36,256
It's true.
I did it and I'm sorry.

709
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:39,792
It just happened, but did you
tell her she hit me first?

710
00:55:39,996 --> 00:55:40,519
Did he say that to you?

711
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:43,164
Dad, I need a place to stay.

712
00:55:43,366 --> 00:55:44,526
What?

713
00:55:44,734 --> 00:55:46,793
Can I stay with you?

714
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:48,695
To me?

715
00:55:50,907 --> 00:55:53,034
Where are you?

716
00:55:58,214 --> 00:56:00,205
Do you think Mike, from my job?

717
00:56:00,417 --> 00:56:03,545
There is a small apartment.
There is hardly room for me.

718
00:56:03,753 --> 00:56:06,278
I got together on
a single couch.

719
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:08,354
Miley, believe me.

720
00:56:08,758 --> 00:56:11,192
I would shelter you if you can.
But I can not.

721
00:56:11,394 --> 00:56:13,862
But you know what?
I could send you some money.

722
00:56:14,063 --> 00:56:17,658
You will be able to
find a temporary home.

723
00:56:17,867 --> 00:56:19,027
Or do you know what?
You can stay at a hotel.

724
00:56:19,235 --> 00:56:21,999
This may be fun.
Do you know any good hotels?

725
00:56:23,673 --> 00:56:25,163
Case?

726
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:27,309
Hello? Casey?

727
00:56:27,877 --> 00:56:29,606
Kay...

728
00:56:41,191 --> 00:56:42,715
Thank you for allowing me
to stay here for the night.

729
00:56:42,926 --> 00:56:43,915
Do not worry.

730
00:56:44,127 --> 00:56:45,924
Are you sure mothers
do not mind?

731
00:56:46,129 --> 00:56:47,756
Yes, completely.

732
00:56:57,474 --> 00:57:00,637
You can use my room.
I'll be up, okay?

733
00:57:02,612 --> 00:57:05,410
My mother has been ringing
me for about an hour.

734
00:57:05,615 --> 00:57:08,175
Take it. Do not answer her.

735
00:57:08,785 --> 00:57:10,650
I'll ever have to.

736
00:57:10,854 --> 00:57:11,912
On the contrary, there is no.

737
00:57:12,121 --> 00:57:13,986
Your mother must realize that
you are already great and...

738
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:16,317
you can make your own decisions.

739
00:57:16,526 --> 00:57:21,725
You are not tied to her. And you
can stay here as much as you want.

740
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:25,794
Now go and take a relaxing
bath and go to sleep.

741
00:57:26,002 --> 00:57:28,937
- All right.
- Going to bed.

742
00:57:29,138 --> 00:57:31,299
Thank you, Amber.

743
00:57:31,508 --> 00:57:33,738
She would do the same for me.

744
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:38,346
- Good night.
- Good night.

745
00:57:50,827 --> 00:57:53,193
I know, I know, I know.

746
00:57:58,101 --> 00:58:02,037
God, look at this junk.
How will I do?

747
00:58:05,408 --> 00:58:07,899
It takes too much.

748
00:58:08,444 --> 00:58:10,071
You should have
warned me earlier.

749
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,304
I pay him for every hour.

750
00:58:11,514 --> 00:58:12,446
Do you know how much it costs me?

751
00:58:12,649 --> 00:58:13,911
"It's mine.
- What?

752
00:58:14,117 --> 00:58:15,675
- That.
- On the contrary. I bought it.

753
00:58:15,885 --> 00:58:18,513
- Remember? It's mine.
- All right, keep it.

754
00:58:18,721 --> 00:58:20,586
In fact, I've paid for everything here.

755
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:23,623
Virtually everything
is mine, feel lucky.

756
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,390
By the way, where is Casey?

757
00:58:26,596 --> 00:58:29,588
She went to a girlfriend
for a few days.

758
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:31,892
Has she not exported?

759
00:58:32,368 --> 00:58:34,768
No, she has not gone.

760
00:58:34,971 --> 00:58:36,700
You've never been
good in lies, Holly.

761
00:58:36,906 --> 00:58:38,237
You are right, this
is your specialty.

762
00:58:38,441 --> 00:58:39,669
Call me at night.

763
00:58:39,876 --> 00:58:42,538
He said he did not want
to live with you anymore.

764
00:58:42,745 --> 00:58:44,736
Where did she go? You know,
first, then, and Casey.

765
00:58:44,948 --> 00:58:48,179
You're fine, you kicked
everyone out of your life.

766
00:58:51,854 --> 00:58:55,813
Take a new TV because I
will go back to the LCD.

767
00:59:00,129 --> 00:59:01,460
Knock Knock?

768
00:59:01,664 --> 00:59:03,461
I got a message from Jack.

769
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:07,193
How do you feel about
earning $ 5,000 today?

770
00:59:07,403 --> 00:59:08,165
You're probably joking?

771
00:59:08,371 --> 00:59:10,134
No! He said we had a rich client...

772
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:13,707
Who likes watching two girls in
action and is willing to pay.

773
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:17,903
- Luck of the lottery. What do you think?
- Troll?

774
00:59:18,114 --> 00:59:18,978
I can not do it.

775
00:59:19,182 --> 00:59:21,150
- Come on, Casey.
- No way!

776
00:59:21,351 --> 00:59:22,943
Do not be so narrow-minded!

777
00:59:23,152 --> 00:59:26,053
What is the problem?
Do not you find me attractive?

778
00:59:26,456 --> 00:59:28,822
Very funny!
Anyway, I'm busy.

779
00:59:29,025 --> 00:59:30,151
Max will return tonight.

780
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,727
Well, we're doing it by 4 o'clock in the afternoon...

781
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:36,194
and you can see Max afterwards.

782
00:59:36,399 --> 00:59:39,232
That's 5 grand!
Only a few such a month and...

783
00:59:39,435 --> 00:59:42,563
you can pay your money and
get your own apartment...

784
00:59:42,772 --> 00:59:44,865
on the beach.

785
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:51,112
All right.
Only me and you.

786
00:59:51,714 --> 00:59:54,911
Yes! All right. I'll call
Jack and tell him we agree.

787
00:59:56,019 --> 00:59:57,919
We agree!

788
01:00:11,834 --> 01:00:15,702
Great rich man?
Really?

789
01:00:15,972 --> 01:00:18,702
You'll be here all the time, right?

790
01:00:19,175 --> 01:00:21,575
I will not move from here.

791
01:00:49,238 --> 01:00:51,069
Unlocked.

792
01:01:14,731 --> 01:01:16,722
Wow.

793
01:01:20,955 --> 01:01:22,752
Hey.

794
01:01:22,957 --> 01:01:26,518
You are both so wonderful.
Thank you for coming.

795
01:01:26,727 --> 01:01:29,059
Make yourself comfortable.

796
01:01:29,463 --> 01:01:31,761
I'm coming in a minute.

797
01:01:34,234 --> 01:01:35,997
He is...

798
01:01:36,203 --> 01:01:39,536
He'll pay us pretty well.

799
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:41,469
Casey...

800
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:45,270
take one of these and you
will not know where you are.

801
01:01:45,479 --> 01:01:46,207
Ok?

802
01:01:46,413 --> 01:01:47,277
No!

803
01:01:47,481 --> 01:01:49,813
I do not want to do it.
Did he see what it looks like?

804
01:01:50,017 --> 01:01:52,451
He is ugly, and old and lousy!

805
01:01:52,653 --> 01:01:54,587
Casey!

806
01:01:56,991 --> 01:01:58,959
And so...

807
01:02:00,461 --> 01:02:03,089
you find me ugly and disgusting.

808
01:02:03,297 --> 01:02:05,765
Please drink.

809
01:02:06,133 --> 01:02:08,966
I'm sorry, I did not
have to say it.

810
01:02:09,169 --> 01:02:12,502
It's interesting to tell
someone in your industry.

811
01:02:12,706 --> 01:02:14,298
Especially considering
the money I pay...

812
01:02:14,508 --> 01:02:17,068
to get exactly the opposite.

813
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,681
Sit next to me.

814
01:02:35,829 --> 01:02:38,195
All right.

815
01:02:49,576 --> 01:02:52,204
I would like to...

816
01:02:55,549 --> 01:02:58,143
I can do it.

817
01:03:00,954 --> 01:03:05,414
And while she does,
I want you to...

818
01:03:14,701 --> 01:03:17,602
You're not particularly convincing.

819
01:03:18,138 --> 01:03:20,333
I am sorry. I can not.

820
01:03:20,541 --> 01:03:22,600
Casey!

821
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:25,472
I need you.

822
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:27,943
Did you hear me? I need...

823
01:03:34,621 --> 01:03:35,747
Hey, what happened?

824
01:03:35,956 --> 01:03:37,321
I can not make it sorry.

825
01:03:37,524 --> 01:03:38,081
What you mean?

826
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:39,452
I'm not going to do it
with this paraglider!

827
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:40,592
I do not care how
much money we offer.

828
01:03:40,794 --> 01:03:42,489
How not!
She hired two girls.

829
01:03:42,729 --> 01:03:43,991
Go back.

830
01:03:44,198 --> 01:03:46,666
You go and do it after
it is so important.

831
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:52,030
Come here! Come here!

832
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:55,640
Listen to me! It has already
caused me enough problems.

833
01:03:55,843 --> 01:04:00,780
So if you do not go back, do
not do what Amber says...

834
01:04:01,648 --> 01:04:04,776
I will beat you in such a way...

835
01:04:04,985 --> 01:04:08,216
that it will be months before you
can guess. Do you understand?

836
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:12,588
Now come back!

837
01:04:15,395 --> 01:04:17,590
- Wait wait!
- Do not...

838
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,762
Casey!
What the hell is going on?

839
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:24,733
Come inside!

840
01:04:56,537 --> 01:05:00,906
- You're fired.
- I'm leaving.

841
01:05:01,808 --> 01:05:04,208
I know where you live.

842
01:05:04,678 --> 01:05:07,238
I know where your dad is working.

843
01:05:07,915 --> 01:05:10,884
If you tell someone...

844
01:05:11,084 --> 01:05:14,713
I will kill both your parents...

845
01:05:16,857 --> 01:05:19,325
and then you too.

846
01:05:19,526 --> 01:05:24,429
And if you think these are empty
promises, think again. I'm a cop.

847
01:05:25,132 --> 01:05:29,626
I know exactly how to
get away with murder.

848
01:06:14,982 --> 01:06:16,847
Hey.

849
01:06:17,417 --> 01:06:20,386
- Is everything alright?
- No.

850
01:06:21,521 --> 01:06:24,081
I did not expect you.

851
01:06:47,814 --> 01:06:50,374
Wow, hello Casey!

852
01:06:51,351 --> 01:06:53,717
Will you join?

853
01:07:03,697 --> 01:07:07,064
I thought I'd see you tonight.

854
01:08:43,764 --> 01:08:45,959
- Casey?
- Mommy?

855
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:50,626
Dear, what happened?
What about you?

856
01:08:52,806 --> 01:08:57,402
"Can you come get me?"
"Of course, where are you?"

857
01:08:59,813 --> 01:09:02,441
And how many girls are
involved in this?

858
01:09:02,649 --> 01:09:04,617
I am not really sure.

859
01:09:05,118 --> 01:09:06,415
A few.

860
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,918
Are they also from your school?

861
01:09:09,122 --> 01:09:11,852
Mom, I told you, I do not
have to talk about it.

862
01:09:14,227 --> 01:09:15,956
Here.
This pimp, how did you meet?

863
01:09:16,163 --> 01:09:19,394
Mom, stop. Everything
you need to know...

864
01:09:19,599 --> 01:09:21,430
is that it's dangerous
if I tell someone...

865
01:09:21,635 --> 01:09:23,796
Baby, we can not let
them get out of here.

866
01:09:24,004 --> 01:09:27,701
They will do the same with another girl.
Someone has to stop them.

867
01:09:27,908 --> 01:09:33,574
Mom, they'll kill me, you know!
So just quit.

868
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:38,308
Dear, if they threatened you,
then we have to go to the police.

869
01:09:38,518 --> 01:09:41,316
God, no!
Certainly not the police.

870
01:09:41,521 --> 01:09:43,751
Promise you will not get involved.

871
01:09:43,957 --> 01:09:46,084
Why?

872
01:09:52,232 --> 01:09:55,599
I do not want to explain
what I've done.

873
01:09:55,902 --> 01:09:58,166
I do not want to tell them
that I have prostituted.

874
01:09:58,371 --> 01:10:00,396
Dear, they lied to you.

875
01:10:00,607 --> 01:10:04,543
They have drawn you into something
you did not want to take part in.

876
01:10:05,412 --> 01:10:07,607
It is not.

877
01:10:08,248 --> 01:10:10,045
I chose it myself.

878
01:10:10,484 --> 01:10:14,011
I myself chose to take the
money, no one made me.

879
01:10:19,926 --> 01:10:23,020
I'm not the one you think, Mom.

880
01:10:24,698 --> 01:10:27,166
I'm not the one I thought I was.

881
01:10:27,367 --> 01:10:29,528
On the contrary, you are.

882
01:10:29,803 --> 01:10:34,797
You are still that little girl I
loved from the moment she was born.

883
01:10:35,575 --> 01:10:39,671
We all are wrong.
I'm also wrong.

884
01:10:40,046 --> 01:10:42,981
It does not define you as a person.

885
01:10:47,821 --> 01:10:50,119
- I'm sorry.
- Do not...

886
01:10:50,323 --> 01:10:52,917
- I'm sorry.
- Dear...

887
01:10:53,193 --> 01:10:56,822
I love you more than
anything in the world.

888
01:10:59,699 --> 01:11:01,530
Let's just move.

889
01:11:01,735 --> 01:11:05,068
Let's just get out of Los Angeles.
I do not want to live here anymore.

890
01:11:07,474 --> 01:11:11,467
We'll make it, I promise you.

891
01:11:19,052 --> 01:11:20,917
I would like to move my
daughter out of this school...

892
01:11:21,121 --> 01:11:24,386
and they said I had
to demand a transfer.

893
01:11:24,591 --> 01:11:27,958
I'm disappointed to hear it. Casey
is among our best students.

894
01:11:28,495 --> 01:11:31,464
- I know.
"There's no problem?"

895
01:11:33,233 --> 01:11:37,431
- Is our conversation confidential?
- Completely!

896
01:11:39,239 --> 01:11:42,470
Casey is afraid to
come back here.

897
01:11:42,676 --> 01:11:45,144
There seem to be some people...

898
01:11:45,712 --> 01:11:47,202
students...

899
01:11:47,414 --> 01:11:50,747
involved in something illegal.

900
01:11:50,951 --> 01:11:52,646
Mrs. Benson, if this is the case...

901
01:11:52,852 --> 01:11:54,410
I need to know what's going on.

902
01:11:54,621 --> 01:11:57,055
I do not know if it's happening on...

903
01:11:57,991 --> 01:11:59,515
the territory of the school but...

904
01:11:59,726 --> 01:12:01,660
I have reasons to believe
that some of the students...

905
01:12:01,861 --> 01:12:05,353
are involved in sexual circles.

906
01:12:07,467 --> 01:12:09,094
Has Casey telling you that?

907
01:12:09,302 --> 01:12:12,567
Did not tell me names...

908
01:12:12,772 --> 01:12:17,436
or details, but it was very clear he
did not want to be part of it all.

909
01:12:17,644 --> 01:12:21,580
But yes, she told me.

910
01:12:23,016 --> 01:12:26,975
With your permission, I
would like to do something.

911
01:12:28,521 --> 01:12:31,319
These are certainly
undesirable news.

912
01:12:31,524 --> 01:12:35,290
Prostitution is becoming an
increasing problem in schools.

913
01:12:36,363 --> 01:12:39,298
In Granada Hills have
caught a 16-year-old boy...

914
01:12:39,499 --> 01:12:41,592
to pimp your 15-year-old
girlfriend.

915
01:12:41,801 --> 01:12:45,362
We are talking about good schools!
These children are of decent families.

916
01:12:45,939 --> 01:12:48,305
Girls do not think they're
doing anything wrong.

917
01:12:48,508 --> 01:12:51,875
Or at least so.

918
01:12:52,178 --> 01:12:53,440
This is a real tragedy.

919
01:12:53,647 --> 01:12:57,276
We need to stop him before
he gets stuck in our school.

920
01:12:57,484 --> 01:13:00,214
Certainly.
Do not worry, Mrs. Benson.

921
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:02,650
I appreciate your daughter's private life.

922
01:13:02,856 --> 01:13:04,983
We will get to the
bottom of this story.

923
01:13:05,191 --> 01:13:08,217
- Thank you.
- For nothing.

924
01:13:08,428 --> 01:13:10,953
Thank you, Officer McKonley.

925
01:13:18,938 --> 01:13:20,565
Director Jenkins will
not be myrrh while...

926
01:13:20,607 --> 01:13:21,972
Casey gave no names!

927
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,437
- Do you understand?
- He will not, Jack.

928
01:13:23,643 --> 01:13:26,806
"I know her, did you understand?"
- You do not know anything!

929
01:13:27,013 --> 01:13:28,913
- Do you understand?
- Understood...

930
01:13:35,021 --> 01:13:36,579
What are you going to do?

931
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:39,054
I took it from the black market...

932
01:13:39,259 --> 01:13:41,921
last year.

933
01:13:42,228 --> 01:13:44,958
The expertise will bring them to him.

934
01:13:45,532 --> 01:13:47,932
"We can not just kill her, Jack!"
- Can not we?

935
01:13:48,134 --> 01:13:48,998
No.

936
01:13:49,235 --> 01:13:51,430
Do you know what happens
if he talks, Amber?

937
01:13:51,638 --> 01:13:53,868
Kylie and Taylor will get away with them.

938
01:13:54,074 --> 01:13:55,598
And we both?

939
01:13:55,742 --> 01:13:58,302
We will go on warm for a long time.

940
01:13:58,511 --> 01:14:00,843
- You want to go to jail?
- No.

941
01:14:01,047 --> 01:14:03,481
- Do you want?
- NO!

942
01:14:07,787 --> 01:14:10,381
You must be very strong now.

943
01:14:12,192 --> 01:14:14,558
Can you do it?

944
01:14:16,229 --> 01:14:19,562
You have to do exactly
what I tell you.

945
01:14:21,101 --> 01:14:24,161
- Okay?
- Okay.

946
01:14:29,375 --> 01:14:32,742
What do you think, transferring
you to Van Westerly?

947
01:14:32,946 --> 01:14:35,847
God. Not this place, there's
Jeremy's girlfriend...

948
01:14:36,049 --> 01:14:39,177
This is recommended by the district.

949
01:14:39,519 --> 01:14:43,182
The regional?
Who did you talk to?

950
01:14:43,389 --> 01:14:45,619
I spoke to Director Jenkins.

951
01:14:45,825 --> 01:14:48,589
Dear God, Mom.
What did you tell her?

952
01:14:48,795 --> 01:14:50,387
Please tell me you did not tell me.

953
01:14:50,597 --> 01:14:52,963
Casey, dear, they asked
me a lot of questions...

954
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:55,498
I did not answer in great detail.

955
01:14:55,668 --> 01:14:58,330
I told her you did not want to discuss...

956
01:14:58,538 --> 01:14:59,505
you know, the details.

957
01:14:59,706 --> 01:15:02,607
- Mom...
"My dear, I had to tell the reason.

958
01:15:02,809 --> 01:15:05,369
- Did anyone see you?
- What do you mean?

959
01:15:05,578 --> 01:15:09,514
Anybody else except
Director Jenkins?

960
01:15:15,188 --> 01:15:17,349
- I'll open.
- No.

961
01:15:17,557 --> 01:15:19,525
I will go.

962
01:15:29,435 --> 01:15:30,333
Amber?

963
01:15:30,537 --> 01:15:32,095
Casey, we need to talk.

964
01:15:32,305 --> 01:15:34,034
- For what?
- I need help.

965
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,901
- Why?
- Because of Jack.

966
01:15:36,109 --> 01:15:38,475
Something happened and
he was just crazy.

967
01:15:38,845 --> 01:15:40,039
Come on, Casey. Open it.

968
01:15:40,246 --> 01:15:41,508
I'm afraid, someone can see me!

969
01:15:41,714 --> 01:15:44,342
- Casey, who is she?
- Hello.

970
01:15:44,551 --> 01:15:46,314
A friend, Amber.

971
01:15:46,820 --> 01:15:48,412
All right.

972
01:15:49,722 --> 01:15:53,180
"Hello, is everything okay?"
- No it is not.

973
01:15:55,428 --> 01:15:56,156
Run, honey!

974
01:15:56,362 --> 01:15:59,024
Do it and your mother dies.

975
01:15:59,232 --> 01:16:00,199
- You're both coming.
- Hadey.

976
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,992
Goodness!

977
01:16:02,235 --> 01:16:03,930
Goodness!

978
01:16:11,778 --> 01:16:14,440
This is crazy!

979
01:16:14,647 --> 01:16:16,512
Shut up!

980
01:16:21,087 --> 01:16:24,545
Amber, keep an eye on
them until I come back.

981
01:16:25,692 --> 01:16:29,059
If they move or try something...

982
01:16:30,697 --> 01:16:32,927
- shoot them.
- All right.

983
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,197
He will.

984
01:17:00,693 --> 01:17:02,627
Dont watch me like that.

985
01:17:39,799 --> 01:17:41,460
- Excuse me, sir?
- What's wrong?

986
01:17:41,668 --> 01:17:44,603
- Get in the car.
- What are you doing.

987
01:17:44,804 --> 01:17:47,398
- Get in the car.
- I'll give you whatever you want.

988
01:17:53,413 --> 01:17:58,043
Amber, help us, please.
What's wrong?

989
01:17:58,251 --> 01:18:00,651
I thought you were my friend.

990
01:18:00,853 --> 01:18:02,115
You obviously did wrong.

991
01:18:02,322 --> 01:18:04,517
If you do that, you will be
an accomplice to a murder.

992
01:18:04,724 --> 01:18:06,919
Yes, and I will spend the
rest of my life in jail.

993
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,787
- Yes.
- Save your fairy tales.

994
01:18:08,995 --> 01:18:10,792
Why would she ruin her
life for this crap?

995
01:18:10,997 --> 01:18:13,192
Because I'm crazy about it?

996
01:18:13,599 --> 01:18:17,228
As far as I know from Casey, you too.

997
01:18:17,937 --> 01:18:19,131
I see what she meant.

998
01:18:19,339 --> 01:18:21,102
Too mouth!

999
01:18:21,307 --> 01:18:24,504
Now both shut up!

1000
01:18:37,056 --> 01:18:38,956
Who are you?

1001
01:18:41,094 --> 01:18:43,392
What is it all about?

1002
01:18:44,297 --> 01:18:47,095
Look does not look like a robber.

1003
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:49,393
What do you want?

1004
01:18:49,836 --> 01:18:50,564
Is it money?

1005
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:53,102
If so, I'll give you money.

1006
01:18:53,373 --> 01:18:55,238
I do not need your money.

1007
01:18:56,943 --> 01:18:58,911
Turn left.

1008
01:19:00,813 --> 01:19:03,213
You do not think he loves you?

1009
01:19:04,017 --> 01:19:05,678
I know she loves me.

1010
01:19:05,885 --> 01:19:07,409
He's a pimp!

1011
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:11,249
Taking advantage of young girls!
Now take advantage of you too!

1012
01:19:11,457 --> 01:19:13,948
May I take advantage of it.

1013
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,794
May I use it to get what I want.

1014
01:19:16,996 --> 01:19:20,432
Did that old man,
in his awful house?

1015
01:19:20,767 --> 01:19:25,932
No. You had to be drugged
to force yourself.

1016
01:19:27,473 --> 01:19:29,498
I did it for the money.

1017
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:33,377
And what do the money bring to you?

1018
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:35,807
Freedom.

1019
01:19:36,015 --> 01:19:38,506
Are you free?

1020
01:19:39,619 --> 01:19:42,213
You do not look like a free man.

1021
01:19:42,789 --> 01:19:45,314
You look, a frightened man.

1022
01:19:50,496 --> 01:19:55,365
I manage high-end services.

1023
01:19:55,701 --> 01:19:58,033
I have an idea.

1024
01:19:58,237 --> 01:20:02,537
Would you like to spend the
evening with one of my girls?

1025
01:20:02,742 --> 01:20:03,709
No thanks.

1026
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:07,676
Why, there is one particular thing that
I think you will be interested in.

1027
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,849
His name is Casey Benson.

1028
01:20:11,451 --> 01:20:15,182
I know I know. Are you surprised?

1029
01:20:16,122 --> 01:20:19,614
One of the best is.

1030
01:20:19,826 --> 01:20:24,593
Honestly, a lot of money brings me.
If you understand what I mean.

1031
01:20:25,298 --> 01:20:27,789
Or at least he did.

1032
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,629
- You are sick.
- Right?

1033
01:20:31,838 --> 01:20:35,365
I know you do not want to hurt us.
We are on your side.

1034
01:20:35,575 --> 01:20:38,043
We want to help you.
Please!

1035
01:20:38,244 --> 01:20:40,075
Please!

1036
01:20:41,514 --> 01:20:43,072
Okay, what do you think will follow...

1037
01:20:43,282 --> 01:20:45,842
after Jack has finished with us?

1038
01:20:47,653 --> 01:20:49,917
- I do not know.
- Let me tell you what happens.

1039
01:20:50,123 --> 01:20:51,750
You will be the next.

1040
01:20:51,958 --> 01:20:54,222
Think about it.
He's ready to kill Casey because...

1041
01:20:54,427 --> 01:20:58,124
may testify against
him as a prostitute.

1042
01:20:58,731 --> 01:21:01,165
You will now become a murder witness.

1043
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,528
If you betray him, he will
get a death sentence.

1044
01:21:04,737 --> 01:21:06,967
He can not afford such a witness.

1045
01:21:07,173 --> 01:21:09,141
She is right.

1046
01:21:13,913 --> 01:21:16,609
Amber, untie us.

1047
01:21:16,816 --> 01:21:18,477
I can not.

1048
01:21:19,318 --> 01:21:24,449
On the contrary, you can! You can!
Come on. Give me the weapon.

1049
01:21:25,124 --> 01:21:28,116
I promise you, we will
not let him hurt you.

1050
01:21:28,327 --> 01:21:32,320
Now we are the only
ones who can help!

1051
01:21:37,503 --> 01:21:39,403
Come on!

1052
01:21:39,605 --> 01:21:41,197
Come on, untie us.

1053
01:21:42,475 --> 01:21:44,204
Come on.

1054
01:21:52,914 --> 01:21:53,381
Hurry up.

1055
01:22:05,431 --> 01:22:07,194
Returned.

1056
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,662
Do not stop.

1057
01:22:11,337 --> 01:22:13,498
- Here.
- Go on.

1058
01:22:13,706 --> 01:22:15,003
OK! Fine!

1059
01:22:18,511 --> 01:22:21,810
- Dad!
- No! She has not done anything...

1060
01:22:22,014 --> 01:22:23,982
Shut up.
Shut up and sit.

1061
01:22:24,217 --> 01:22:26,208
Take off the jacket.
Take it off.

1062
01:22:26,419 --> 01:22:28,319
OK! Relax.

1063
01:22:29,722 --> 01:22:31,587
Now sit down.

1064
01:22:36,395 --> 01:22:38,955
If he moves, kill him.

1065
01:22:40,533 --> 01:22:42,933
What is all this about?
What are you doing?

1066
01:22:43,135 --> 01:22:45,330
Why are you causing it to us?

1067
01:22:45,538 --> 01:22:47,438
I will not do it.

1068
01:22:48,207 --> 01:22:50,175
You will do it.

1069
01:22:56,048 --> 01:23:00,644
You see, you're an angry,
divorcing husband...

1070
01:23:00,853 --> 01:23:02,946
his impending expulsion
from his own house.

1071
01:23:06,092 --> 01:23:08,560
- So you're going to shoot wives.
- What?

1072
01:23:08,761 --> 01:23:11,025
And your daughter.

1073
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:12,993
And then you will kill yourself.

1074
01:23:15,301 --> 01:23:18,930
America's killer-suicide
typical of America.

1075
01:23:19,238 --> 01:23:21,399
It happens every day.

1076
01:23:21,841 --> 01:23:23,274
You will never get away with it.

1077
01:23:23,476 --> 01:23:25,603
They will understand that you did it.
They will understand that it was you.

1078
01:23:25,811 --> 01:23:28,279
Who 's'? The police?

1079
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:31,382
I'm the policeman, Mr Benson.

1080
01:23:31,584 --> 01:23:34,212
I know exactly how to
impersonate a crime scene.

1081
01:23:37,089 --> 01:23:41,253
Casey, I'm sorry.
I love you. It's all my fault.

1082
01:23:41,460 --> 01:23:43,155
- It is my fault...
"You'll shut up!"

1083
01:23:43,362 --> 01:23:44,090
I'm sorry.

1084
01:23:44,297 --> 01:23:46,788
I hate to look at you
how you pretend.

1085
01:23:48,534 --> 01:23:51,469
Do it and get out?

1086
01:23:58,411 --> 01:23:59,537
Please, I will give you
whatever you want.

1087
01:23:59,745 --> 01:24:01,406
I will sell the house.
I'll give you everything I have.

1088
01:24:01,614 --> 01:24:03,707
Please do not do it.

1089
01:24:05,751 --> 01:24:07,719
No.

1090
01:24:09,455 --> 01:24:12,686
I will not let you kill them.

1091
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:20,530
Mila, do not bullshit.

1092
01:24:20,933 --> 01:24:22,958
Run the gun.

1093
01:24:23,169 --> 01:24:26,764
No, let yours go.

1094
01:24:41,287 --> 01:24:43,255
Did she really think I'd
give you a loaded weapon?

1095
01:24:47,059 --> 01:24:49,254
Run, Casey! Run!

1096
01:24:49,662 --> 01:24:51,493
Run!

1097
01:24:56,602 --> 01:24:58,729
Holly!

1098
01:26:37,736 --> 01:26:39,966
It was the first offense for Amber.

1099
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:43,904
The judge agreed that she had
been manipulated by McConnell...

1100
01:26:44,109 --> 01:26:46,600
so he received 5
years of probation.

1101
01:26:47,313 --> 01:26:50,043
I heard her mother had to sell
the house to pay the lawyers...

1102
01:26:50,249 --> 01:26:52,615
eventually moved
to another state.

1103
01:26:53,018 --> 01:26:55,486
I do not know what happened
to Amber afterwards.

1104
01:26:55,888 --> 01:26:58,049
We never saw each other again.

1105
01:26:58,290 --> 01:27:01,487
Taylor's parents sent her
to a dependency setting.

1106
01:27:01,827 --> 01:27:03,260
He came back and finished, but...

1107
01:27:03,462 --> 01:27:05,657
it was no longer the same.

1108
01:27:06,165 --> 01:27:09,134
Kyle's family
actually denied it...

1109
01:27:09,335 --> 01:27:12,202
I think you blame me for this.

1110
01:27:19,245 --> 01:27:21,611
Are you proud of yourself?

1111
01:27:25,451 --> 01:27:27,510
Yes.

1112
01:27:34,527 --> 01:27:37,519
With Mom and Dad, we
attended the Amber trial.

1113
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:38,662
In some strange way...

1114
01:27:38,864 --> 01:27:41,196
this brought us together
again as a family.

1115
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:44,028
I think he helped Mom and Dad
think twice about divorce.

1116
01:27:44,837 --> 01:27:45,963
As for me...

1117
01:27:46,171 --> 01:27:49,106
that summer they accepted me in Wittendale,

1118
01:27:49,308 --> 01:27:50,935
and I never looked back.
