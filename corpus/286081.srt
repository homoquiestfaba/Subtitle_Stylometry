00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:13,335
I'm home.

3
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,275
Hello?

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:19,545
I'm back.

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,389
Hello? It's daddy.

6
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:25,749
Yes, I'm late.

7
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:27,821
Are you studying hard?

8
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,786
Say what?

9
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,030
None of my business?

10
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:34,294
That's interesting.

11
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:35,765
You learned that from TV?

12
00:00:36,136 --> 00:00:39,731
Hello? Can you get mom?

13
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,646
Hello?

14
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:49,745
You're busy?

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,215
How come you are...

16
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,183
What are you doing this Late?

17
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,148
What the...
Hello?

18
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,286
Hello...

19
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:05,192
Yes, I got cut off.

20
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:10,529
I was going to tell your
Mom about this first, but...

21
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:13,230
I've got some news.

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,337
Guess what!

23
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:20,244
I might make it back to the head office.

24
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,810
Isn't that great?

25
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:28,416
It's time to go home
after three lonely years.

26
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:31,088
Oops, hello?

27
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:38,754
Why the answering machine?

28
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:41,162
It doesn't make sense.

29
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:46,295
Something's wrong with mom and the
kids.

30
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,902
I guess I can't blame them.

31
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:57,879
They've been left alone without
the man of the house.

32
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:04,618
The ideal husband and father
suddenly gone for work.

33
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,554
It's been three years.

34
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:09,628
They could become a little crazy.

35
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:13,388
Even I've been talking to myself lately.

36
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,567
Everything is going to be just fine now.

37
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:19,899
I'm going home!

38
00:02:20,773 --> 00:02:22,400
Daddy's going home soon!

39
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,469
We're gonna be happy!

40
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,249
Sorry. I'll be quiet.

41
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,626
He is insane.

42
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:48,299
The kid next door must be insane.

43
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:54,539
No music. Not even the TV.

44
00:02:54,874 --> 00:02:58,310
And he complains when I talk at night.

45
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,504
I live quietly here all by myself.

46
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,714
AII alone...

47
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:13,789
No...

48
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,722
No, I'm not alone.

49
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,004
Where are you?

50
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:36,475
Where are you tonight?

51
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,316
I'm not alone.

52
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:13,544
I'm not alone at all.

53
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,678
Mom and the kids are weird somehow.

54
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:18,918
I'm all right.

55
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,690
I'm not alone.

56
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,695
I am not alone at all.

57
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,320
I'm all right.

58
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,898
Daddy's going home soon.

59
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:28,931
Just wait.

60
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,696
I'm going home soon.

61
00:04:31,838 --> 00:04:35,638
That kid next door is insane!

62
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,538
It's going to be just fine.

63
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,511
I'll be home soon.

64
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,910
I'm not alone.

65
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,009
I'II be home.

66
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:45,611
It's gonna be fine.

67
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:47,347
He's insane!

68
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,584
The kid next door is insane!

69
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,558
I'm fine.

70
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,717

It's cold.

73
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,748
Are the fish biting?

74
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,918
No way. Moron.

75
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,920
Are the fish biting?

76
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,727
Are the fish biting?

77
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,094
No, uh...

78
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,660
Not at all.

79
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,373
Raccoon dogs and foxes
that take human form...

80
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:52,109
...aren't just the stuff
of tales from long ago.

81
00:05:52,518 --> 00:06:01,449
There's always a chance that you'll
run across them, even now in your daily
life.

82
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:05,158
That was odd...

83
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,967
Might as well call it a day.

84
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,558

Look at that!

91
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:15,093
Fox or raccoon or
whatever, just knock it off!

92
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:21,059
Is hitting people with
stones all you got, huh?

93
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:27,495
I'm not afraid at all!

94
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,788
Is this all you got?

95
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,552
Morons!

96
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,719
Maybe it was my singing...

97
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:24,627
Is this serious?

98
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,835
I apologize. I'm sorry!

99
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,826

Whether you accept it
or not, it does exist.

102
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:44,731
What does the visitor that
comes at 2:00 want to tell you?

103
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:53,138
I think there's a ghost in my room.

104
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,141
What? You're joking.

105
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,979
You were just dreaming.

106
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:03,885
I wake up the same time
every night sweating.

107
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,324
Well, that's probably...

108
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,517
What?

109
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,994
Puberty.

110
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:13,964
Oh, Honey.

111
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,198
You're going to be Late for work!

112
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:44,193
It might be there.

113
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:45,922
What?

114
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:49,267
It started last summer, right?

00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,562
How can you tell?

116
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:13,052
You suddenly become
quiet at exactly 2:00.

117
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,958
That went on for a week.

118
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,278
Cut it out!

119
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:15,615

Well, I'm quitting the job.

123
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:23,345
Finally.

124
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:26,548
Yes, finally. It's gone to the limit.

125
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,184
Haven't you transferred?

126
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:32,695
Yes, but that didn't
change anything at all.

127
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,727
Everybody is so lazy!

128
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,536
That means I have to cover their work.

129
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:43,267
But they get paid better than me.

130
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,707
I can't take that anymore.

131
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,273
I understand.

See?

133
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,112
Then, after that?

134
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,940
I don't know that yet.

00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,464
How about your boyfriend?

138
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,625
Marriage is another matter.

139
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,665
It's not that I don't like him.

140
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:19,708
You see, I spent a lot of time thinking
about married Life.

141
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,980
It's not what I really want.

00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:25,348
You see?

144
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,579
Actually, my boyfriend proposed to me.

145
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,416
Really? Will you say yes?

Well, I don't think so.

I know.

148
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,495
I never thought of marrying him.

149
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,462
But, he was serious about it from the
start.

00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:42,497
I see.

151
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,432
He should've told me first.

Are we out in the country?

It's just some special
occasion, I guess.

She's Late!

161
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:19,467
We'll run out of snacks
before she gets back.

00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,672
I'm getting bored.

163
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,202
Are you going home?

00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,178
No, I'm bored of that too.

How can she Live here?

172
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:50,667
Have you been waiting?

173
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,329
You're late!
Have you been waiting?

174
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,428
Sorry.

175
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:58,134
I couldn't find any
drinks around the area.

176
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,738
I hate rural places.

00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:00,742
Shut up!

178
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:02,313

00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,348
Trains?

180
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,279
Yes, trains.

181
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:06,248
There are no trains here.

182
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,649
There was one just now.

183
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:10,311
There's a river on one side.

184
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:13,147
You walked from the station.

185
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,753
The trains don't come this way.

186
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,252

187
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:22,093

back to my home town.

It's bitter.

191
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,869
Maybe I should go back
and just take it easy.

192
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:40,645
But my father will set me
up for marriage, I'm sure.

193
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:44,711
I don't Like the custom
of arranged marriages.

194
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:48,190
It just doesn't feel right.

195
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,621
Are you with me?

197
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,265
Tetsuya killed himself.

198
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,263
The Last time I saw
him was six months ago.

199
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:16,938
What do you mean, ''quitting work?''

200
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,684
I've just had enough.

201
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,623
I'll find some other job.

202
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:35,860
A part time job at a
coffee shop or whatever.

203
00:20:40,038 --> 00:20:41,869
Anything would be fine.

204
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:47,507
But I believed in you. I ignored
my parents to be here with you.

205
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:53,942
You said that we'd marry
once we got settled down.

206
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,014
This is not fair.

207
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,320
I just can't go on.

208
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:05,327
I'm finished!

209
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:11,428
Tetsuya!

210
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,339
Why?

211
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:17,669
What happened to you?

212
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,503
You've never talked Like this before.

213
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,544
What happened to you?

214
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:29,319
Come on, you can do it
for me! I'm begging you.

215
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,087
Hang in there!

216
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,419
Stop it!
Hang in there!

217
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:33,683
Tetsuya!

218
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,065
Tetsuya.

219
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:50,774
When he walked out, I had no way of
knowing that he had acute depression.

220
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:59,946
It was only much later that I Learned
that encouraging him made it worse.

221
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:05,489
''Hang in there'' is the
Last thing to say to someone Like that.

222
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:12,963
But on that day, I don't know
how many times I said that to him.

223
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:31,973
Tetsuya?

224
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,545
Tetsuya?

225
00:22:46,998 --> 00:22:48,727
That's you, isn't it?

226
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,135
Tetsuya, I'm sorry.

227
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:54,838
Please forgive me.

228
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,440
AII those things I said...

229
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,510
Please forgive me!

230
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:20,493
Tetsuya...

231
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:31,635
Tetsuya...

232
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:41,910
Tetsuya?

233
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:46,749
Tetsuya...

234
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,508
Tetsuya!

235
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:19,621
Tetsuya!

236
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,687
Tetsuya, stop it!

237
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,563
Stop it. Tetsuya, stop it!

238
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,170
Stop it!

239
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,465
Please, oh God! Stop it!

240
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:40,469
I was wrong. Forgive me, Tetsuya!
Please!

241
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,922
That's when I knew
he had hanged himself.

00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:05,567

00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:08,769
Seriously? No way!

245
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,842
That guy is stupid.

246
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,578
I just got to the hospital.

247
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,510
I'm so annoyed with Yamada.

248
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:19,708
He's been on paid vacation
for two weeks straight.

249
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:25,120
I'd understand if he was dying, but
why do I have to come get his mother?

250
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:28,021
She's not even dead yet.

251
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,859
Yeah, Leukemia.

252
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,328
The disease where blood turns white.

253
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:36,294
No! My boss told me to come here.

254
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,270
He said I'm the closest
to him, so I should go.

255
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,965
What?

256
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,604
To be honest, we drew straws and I lost.

257
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:50,645
He's so creepy sometimes.

258
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,181
He lives with his Mom,
just the two of them.

259
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:57,277
It's Like he's saying ''I'm a virgin!''

260
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:58,821
Right?

261
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,560
His mother should die soon,
so he can be on his own.

262
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,261
Ah, found it.

263
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,228

Ah, found it.

00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:09,060
Ine Yamada? That's her name?

265
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:14,005
Cell phone use is prohibited
on hospital premises.

266
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,203
Excuse me.

267
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:25,839
Wake up!

269
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:37,685
You promised you would
go to Disneyland with me!

270
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:41,361
You promised to cook for me again!

276
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:17,065

277
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,370
Suzuki.

278
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,975
This is from the company.

279
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:28,776
What is it?

280
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,815
A melon.

281
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:37,216
I thought it was a bomb.

282
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:41,357
Mama...

283
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,082

285
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:49,296
No! Mama!

286
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,128
No!

00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,735
Say something!

295
00:28:31,509 --> 00:28:33,136

296
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,288

Please wait!

313
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,435
You were just watching
from the window, right?

314
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,396
You want to play with us, right?

Wait a minute.

319
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,932
Who are you always playing with?

320
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,704
Akemi Takayama.

321
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:28,371
Where does she Live?

322
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:31,471
On the 5th floor of
this building. Room 502.

323
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:35,386
Really? When did she move here?

324
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:39,712
See, she's calling me
again so I gotta go.

325
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,524
Nobody is calling you.

326
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,594
What?

327
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:50,533
See! I didn't come outside, she Left.

328
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,238
Eiko, come here for a second.

329
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:03,178
Nobody Lives here.

330
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,579
That's not true, because...

331
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:08,241
Because why?

332
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:13,423
I always write her
letters saying ''Let's Play''

333
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:17,994
And then she always comes
to our door to meet me.

334
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,778
This has been empty for two years.

335
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:46,620
Eiko!

336
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,798

That's the end of the trip.

341
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,698
Well, you go ahead and...

342
00:35:03,868 --> 00:35:07,099
It was after a horror video shooting.

343
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:11,742
Because there weren't enough rooms,
two of us had to stay in a different motel.

344
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:16,676
I sensed that something
was going to happen.

345
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,524

346

Yoko, don't you feel anything?

347
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,609
Nothing.

348
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,744
This is just a regular motel.

349
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:16,471
Are there any other guests?

350
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:00,742
Yoko.

351
00:37:00,952 --> 00:37:02,442

Don't open it!

00:41:11,735 --> 00:41:13,066
No.

378
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:17,870
Does your husband ever say so?

379
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:23,239
He doesn't really care about it.

380
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:32,911
But...

381
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:36,017
When I'm home alone...

382
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,230
Don't worry about it too much.

383
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,931
I see.

384
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,162
Okay, thank you.

385
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:53,776
I know how to get home from here.

386
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:56,302
Thanks for everything.

387
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:57,308
See you.

388
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:45,278
Kaori?

389
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:46,912
Etsuko?

390
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,395
What did you keep in the garden?

391
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:53,822
Garden?

392
00:43:53,931 --> 00:43:55,228
What's with it?

393
00:43:57,101 --> 00:44:00,867
You'd better leave the house soon.

394
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:20,921
Murders occurred in that house.

395
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:28,830
The corpses were fed to a beast.

396
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:38,139
Is there a bug flying around?

397
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,350
Tales of Terror

398
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,368
Yaeko! Are you ready yet?

399
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:10,200
Sorry, I'II be right there.

400
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:15,976
She said that, but what
if she never comes?

401
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,946
Sorry, I'm Late.

402
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:25,450
Tsugumi, be a good girl
and take care of the house.

403
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,722
Okay, let's go.

404
00:45:30,194 --> 00:45:31,422
Tsugumi.

405
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:40,893
Don't open the altar today, Okay?

406
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,838
Hurry up. Let's go!

407
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,540
Wait a minute.

408
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,220
Would you Like some juice?

409
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,129
Okay.

410
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:29,444
Have we ever played together before?

411
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,521
What's your name?

412
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,662
Stop it! It hurts.

413
00:48:24,468 --> 00:48:26,959
Let me go!

414
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,431
Stop! You're hurting me!

415
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:33,702
Let me go!

416
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,201
What are you doing?

417
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:36,539
Let me go!

418
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,450
Where's mommy?

419
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:30,299
Where's mommy?

420
00:49:34,104 --> 00:49:35,571
You opened it!

421
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:50,044
Tales of Terror

422
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:55,214
This is a story about me
house sitting for my aunt.

423
00:49:55,459 --> 00:50:04,060
I wanted to take care of my Aunt's dog
Chippy, so I decided to take the job.

424
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,276
What?

425
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,231
What is this?

426
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:55,546
Who's there?

427
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:58,753
Is anybody there?

428
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:17,129
Chippy is being a bad doggie.

429
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:26,369
Who are you?

430
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:37,719
Was that a dream?

431
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:48,363
Is this a dream, too?

432
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,434
Who are you?

433
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:04,514
Was this a dream, too?

434
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:17,451
This is just a dream!

435
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:19,194
Stop it!

436
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:22,896
No!

437
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,574
Was everything a dream?

438
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:00,030
AII right! It was just a dream!

439
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:09,843
What is this?

440
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:18,547
Oh, you were the one licking me.

441
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,559
You scared me!

442
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,538
Tales of Terror

443
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:50,614
Is this recording?

444
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,684
The red light is on.
It should be recording.

445
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:54,947
Oh yeah.

446
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,789
My name is Shiro Tobe.

447
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,091
I am in the 8th grade.

448
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:09,293
This is my house.

449
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:15,911
This is my mother.

450
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:17,343
Don't record me!

451
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,381
Introduce yourself, Mom.

452
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:20,513
Hurry!

453
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:22,843
I am Shiro's mother, Mitsuko.

454
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:25,920
Don't get too close or I will look fat!

455
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:28,650
The band-aid on her forehead
is where she got bit by a bug.

456
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,852
Stop it!

457
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:36,531
Dad is working overtime
tonight, so Mom is a Little sad.

458
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,099
A Little.

459
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,392
Okay, that's enough.

460
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:41,936
Get out!

461
00:55:46,643 --> 00:55:48,008
This is a plant.

462
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:50,837
Here we have a shoe horn.

463
00:55:51,147 --> 00:55:53,911
This is the slipper rack.

464
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:58,114
The electrical outlet...

465
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:04,956
What else is interesting?

466
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,087
How about the stairs?

467
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,800
This is my older sister.

468
00:56:11,401 --> 00:56:12,527
Are you taping me?

469
00:56:12,635 --> 00:56:13,397
Can't you see?

470
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:14,835
I can't believe you!

471
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:16,461
Oh, it's okay.

472
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:18,467
I'm still taping you.

473
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,370
Don't be mad.

474
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:26,540
My feet.

475
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:27,479
And my big toe.

476
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:30,886
And my butt.

477
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:32,421
The Hulk!

478
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:33,750
This is boring.

479
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,822
Here is my leg hair.

480
00:56:39,996 --> 00:56:41,987
I don't have that much.

481
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:44,859
How about my nose hair?

482
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:48,164
My legs Look skinny from this angle.

483
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,164
The Hulk!

484
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:55,968
This is the foyer.

485
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,748
Mom, someone is at the door!

486
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:06,720
I'm coming.

487
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:12,027
I told you not to tape me.

488
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,086
Stop it!

489
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:17,700
Dad? Did you forget your keys?

490
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,933
No one is here.

491
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:29,872
Hey!

492
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:32,476
You're being stupid.

493
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:35,044
Dad, you failed your mission.

494
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:36,878
Shot down!

495
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:40,188
Maybe my timing was off.

496
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:43,055
Or I should say ''Bahhhh!''

497
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,119
Are you recording right now?

498
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,122
You recorded that?

499
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:51,729
What? Don't tape me.

500
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:53,901
Introduce yourself, Dad.

501
00:57:54,070 --> 00:57:55,697
I'm a Little embarrassed.

502
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:00,004
I am Shiro's father Takao, 44 years old.

503
00:58:00,176 --> 00:58:01,541
Too formal?

504
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:04,078
You don't have to be serious.

505
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:06,011
That's a really small camera.

506
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,810
Yep.

507
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:15,081
Actually, they really love each other.

508
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,758
Mom, someone is at the door!

509
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,558
What?

510
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:24,190
Someone is here!

511
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:31,500
Who would come at this time?

512
00:58:33,576 --> 00:58:36,739
You asked someone to
do this, didn't you?

513
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,110
I wouldn't do that...

514
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:40,580
What's going on?

515
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,119
This is outrageous at this hour

516
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:48,280
I'II talk to them.

517
00:58:50,793 --> 00:58:51,589
Who's there?

518
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,059
No one is there.

519
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:55,597
This is strange.

520
00:59:03,339 --> 00:59:04,670
What the heck?

521
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:05,808
HEY!

522
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,608
What?

523
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,309
Lock it.

524
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:41,567
Tales of Terror

525
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:48,311
It has been two weeks since
the strange incidents started.

526
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:04,832
It's happening again.

527
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:06,697
At the exact same time.

528
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:08,303
I'II tape it.

529
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:09,666
Shiro!

530
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:12,939
Just Leave it alone.

531
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:15,835
Okay.

532
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:23,914
We figured out it always
lasts for ten minutes.

533
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:26,885
Dad just ignores it now.

534
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:32,726
But, one night...

535
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:53,279
What?

536
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:54,314
What's wrong?

537
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,077
Suddenly, all of these...

538
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:58,082
What?

539
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,665
What's going on?

540
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:13,996
Dad!

541
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,413
This is really out of the ordinary.

542
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:49,698
After a couple of days,
this guy came to our house.

543
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,363
This way, please.

544
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,768
Thank you for coming.

545
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:02,378
What's the problem?

546
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,760
Is there an intersection nearby?

547
01:02:12,929 --> 01:02:13,486
Um...

548
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:15,923
Yes, there is, but what does that mean?

549
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:21,429
Many people died there, right?

550
01:02:28,211 --> 01:02:29,405
And this house...

551
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:36,008
...could be a passageway for the dead.

552
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,077
Wow, that's scary...

553
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:43,183
Well, Let’s go inside.

554
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:45,987
Um...

555
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:54,195
How Long have all of
you been living here?

556
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,233
A Little over a year.

557
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,041
How can you put up with it?

558
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:44,214
I did some research, but couldn’t
find any related complaints.

559
01:03:45,454 --> 01:03:46,853
I see.

560
01:03:47,924 --> 01:03:49,391
I thought so.

561
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:51,892
Are you ok?

562
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:54,621
I'm fine.

563
01:03:55,932 --> 01:04:02,861
Hey... There are scientists
who research these incidents.

564
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:06,363
Scientists?

565
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:09,569
Have you seen a film called
''The Legend Of Hell House''?

566
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,203
No.

567
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:13,381
What's that about?

568
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,635
Tales of Terror

569
01:04:41,577 --> 01:04:46,913
Yes. It has been 3 months
since the first poltergeist.

570
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:51,017
There are scientists who
research these incidents.

571
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:52,887
Scientists?

572
01:04:53,923 --> 01:04:57,188
Have you seen a film called
''The Legend Of Hell House''?

573
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:58,156
No.

574
01:04:58,661 --> 01:05:00,151
What's that about?

575
01:05:01,931 --> 01:05:07,096
It says that people constantly
generate electromagnetic energy.

576
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:11,263
Sometimes, that energy
gathers in one place.

577
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:15,333
This energy can cause
individuals to hallucinate.

578
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:19,173
This is called the ''Poltergeist
Phenomena''.

579
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:24,319
Evidence suggests this phenomena
is caused by these energy fields.

580
01:05:25,187 --> 01:05:29,248
These energy fields can
cause people to feel scared.

581
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:04,389
We decided to depend on the scientists.

582
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:12,565
We found reactions in this Living
room, but mostly in the foyer.

583
01:06:12,702 --> 01:06:13,361
Yes.

584
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:15,131
Exactly.

585
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:19,568
At 10:15 pm, the phenomena began.

586
01:06:19,675 --> 01:06:20,733
Yes.

587
01:06:21,744 --> 01:06:25,271
According to our data,
the nearby power plant...

588
01:06:25,414 --> 01:06:29,350
...increases power
for maintenance checks.

589
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:32,615
This happens at 10:15.

590
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,322
I see.

591
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:40,254
So, this is not a poltergeist?

592
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:42,454
Right. There is no such thing as ghosts.

593
01:06:42,631 --> 01:06:45,327
We will prove this to you.

594
01:06:49,705 --> 01:06:52,503
Now, we are ready.

595
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:54,337
Let's begin.

596
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:03,307
They took their time, and got rid
off all the electromagnetic energy.

597
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:09,018
They were Like exterminators.

598
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:11,285
They looked so professional.

599
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:12,520
Yeah.

600
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,562
It's clear now.

601
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:21,795
There are no problems now.

602
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:24,467
I don't know what to say..

603
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:26,302
Thank you so much.

604
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:31,237
There will be no more poltergeists
in this house from now on.

605
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:41,818
Like he said, all the
poltergeists were gone.

606
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:43,850
For just one month.

607
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:52,799
What's that?

608
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,467
What about the kids?

609
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:00,705
Are you guys okay?

610
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:02,140
What's this noise?

611
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:02,869
It's so loud!

612
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:04,237
Downstairs!

613
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:36,311
From that point on, we
stopped Living there.

614
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:39,307
We couldn’t take it anymore.

615
01:08:39,582 --> 01:08:43,712
That night, we went to
a hotel in our pajamas.

616
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:47,321
I can't forget those ghosts, even now.

617
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:51,392
We don't know what happened
to the house after that.

618
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:55,121
I don't even want to
get close to that house.

619
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:56,862
That's right.

620
01:08:56,966 --> 01:08:59,491
I haven't gone near that house again.

621
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:02,201
I don't want to remember.

622
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:06,396
I wonder what happened to that house.

623
01:09:10,446 --> 01:09:13,677
Does someone Live there now?

624
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:22,255
Tales of Terror

625
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:31,596
Even now, I don't know what it was.

626
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:37,872
I was hiking up the price of land.

627
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,733
Right. No problem.

628
01:09:43,245 --> 01:09:46,703
They're old, they don't
have much time Left.

629
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:50,949
They are rich for country yokels.

630
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:52,809
Huh?

631
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:54,614
Hello?

632
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:56,252
Hello?

633
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:57,655
What the heck?

634
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,692
Hello?

635
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:00,962
<i>Out of Service Area</i>

636
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:04,229
I hate the countryside.

637
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:23,247
After a while, sleepiness overcame me.

638
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:27,886
This is not good.

639
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:31,726
I should stop and take a rest.

640
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,988
When I was thinking about it...

641
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:48,676
I found myself in a bathtub.

642
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:51,411
What?

643
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:00,011
Hi.

644
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:04,048
I-I'm not a burglar.

645
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:08,328
It's okay.

646
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:11,598
By bike? By car?

647
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:13,457
The car.

648
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:14,466
What?

649
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:19,530
If you came by car,
it's there by the field.

650
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:20,636
The field?

651
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:26,478
I'm sorry to come in uninvited.

652
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:30,609
Don't feel bad about it,
it happens occasionally.

653
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:32,946
Occasionally?

654
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:45,690
I started to feel sleepy...

655
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:55,469
However, unconsciously,
I parked my car here...

656
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,747
...went to that house...

657
01:12:08,123 --> 01:12:15,427
...opened the door, went
inside and got in the bathtub.

658
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,867
That's ridiculous.

659
01:12:20,536 --> 01:12:22,026
That doesn't make sense.

660
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:24,735
This can't happen.

661
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,706
You found it, right?

662
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:29,474
Your car.

663
01:12:32,648 --> 01:12:33,910
Yes.

664
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:37,380
Excuse me, Ma'am?

665
01:12:37,653 --> 01:12:39,917
What the heck happened?

666
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:43,048
You don't Live here, do you?

667
01:12:43,158 --> 01:12:44,125
Right.

668
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,894
Um, my name is Narimoto.

669
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:50,863
Sometimes this happens to
people from out of town.

670
01:12:51,934 --> 01:12:53,060
Sometimes?

671
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:59,965
I don't know why, but it only happens
when I take the water out of the tub.

672
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:07,642
Right before I open the door to wash
the bathtub, they regain consciousness.

673
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:14,912
People on bikes would appear holding
the handlebars and on their knees.

674
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:21,125
That's why I asked if
you came by bike or car.

675
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:26,690
What on earth?

676
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:31,665
I think it's the fox.

677
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:41,446
There is a myth that any outsiders trying
to harm this town are cursed by a fox.

678
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,753
That's stupid!

679
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:50,853
In this day and age, we
can send people to the moon.

680
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:57,031
Doesn't this ring any bells?

681
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:20,511
Tales of Terror

682
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:50,075
Let me ask you again.

683
01:14:53,088 --> 01:15:01,257
At 1 :40 AM, you were going
towards Tokyo on Route 222...

684
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:06,630
...and a young lady appeared
running towards your car.

685
01:15:07,302 --> 01:15:08,860
Is that correct?

686
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:11,766
Yes.

687
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:20,606
I was returning from a business
trip and it was getting Late.

688
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:23,551
The road was so windy.

689
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:28,748
I don't think I was going that fast.

690
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:10,999
And there was a girl?

691
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:14,792
I was so frightened, I closed my eyes.

692
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:19,036
When I opened them, she was gone.

693
01:16:20,976 --> 01:16:23,945
And you walked all the way here?

694
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:18,160
Boss?

695
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:42,756
Mr. Naito.

696
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:48,089
I don't think you are lying.

697
01:17:49,297 --> 01:17:53,927
But on the police report...

698
01:17:54,903 --> 01:18:00,398
...I will write that you mistook
a small animal for a person.

699
01:18:01,276 --> 01:18:07,408
That caused you to hit the brake.

700
01:18:09,718 --> 01:18:11,481
Is that Okay?

701
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:51,483
Mr. Naito?

702
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:56,093
Is there anything wrong?

703
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:05,504
Nothing, please write what you said...

704
01:19:16,551 --> 01:19:18,041
Tales of Terror

705
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:24,488
I married into a very traditional
Japanese family in the countryside.

706
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:28,261
You seem to be adapting well
to this way of Life.

707
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:32,055
AII you need now is a child of your own.

708
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:33,762
Yes.

709
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:39,870
These beads...

710
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:44,001
Takashi gave this to me as a gift.

711
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,108
I see.

712
01:19:47,415 --> 01:19:49,212
Takashi did.

713
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:55,586
The only wish my mother-in-law
has is to see is her grandchild's face.

714
01:19:56,024 --> 01:20:03,396
My husband works at a foreign firm,
and is often away for more than a month.

715
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:06,398
Then, one night...

716
01:20:06,968 --> 01:20:10,870
I knew my menstruation was near.

717
01:20:11,072 --> 01:20:16,908
Since I moved into this
house, I would dream about fog...

718
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:19,546
...right before I would menstruate.

719
01:20:23,051 --> 01:20:24,484
What's happening?

720
01:20:36,464 --> 01:20:37,590
Who are you?

721
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:41,000
You're pregnant!

722
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:44,098
Pregnant!

723
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:46,140
No, I'm not.

724
01:20:47,309 --> 01:20:50,608
Give me your unborn child!

725
01:20:50,879 --> 01:20:52,403
There is no child inside me.

726
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,607
The successor of this
family is inside you!

727
01:20:54,883 --> 01:20:55,474
No, it is not.

728
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:57,484
Give it to me!

729
01:21:07,128 --> 01:21:08,925
Don't play games with me.

730
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:12,622
How do you know I'm
pregnant, when I don't?

731
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:15,463
Why do you want my baby?

732
01:21:15,637 --> 01:21:20,870
I assumed it was a
dream, so I was not timid.

733
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:26,044
If you want to kill
me, go ahead and do it!

734
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:34,488
Those beads mean nothing!

735
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:53,401
What's wrong?

736
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,107
What are you doing here?

737
01:21:55,277 --> 01:21:58,178
I heard a Loud voice
coming from this room.

738
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:03,010
Then it sounded Like someone
was shuffling across pebbles.

739
01:22:12,394 --> 01:22:14,157
What happened here?

740
01:22:14,462 --> 01:22:15,622
You are sweating...

741
01:22:19,067 --> 01:22:20,659
I had a dream.

742
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:26,366
A creepy looking samurai came
and asked me for my unborn child.

743
01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:33,737
Did you see the samurai's family crest?

744
01:22:34,582 --> 01:22:35,549
Family crest?

745
01:22:35,650 --> 01:22:37,709
Yes, his family crest.

746
01:22:43,425 --> 01:22:47,156
I didn't see a crest on his back.

747
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:49,389
Etsuko.

748
01:22:49,597 --> 01:22:54,432
Don't ever lose these beads.

749
01:22:54,569 --> 01:22:55,695
Okay.

750
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:09,345
After 3 months, I became pregnant
and successfully gave birth.

751
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:14,748
I never told you this but...

752
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:16,012
What?

753
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:21,589
This family's first born has
always been a miscarriage.

754
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:27,328
Takashi is my second child.

755
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:30,435
So, you too...

756
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:34,269
Is that samurai our ancestor?

757
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:36,768
I'm not sure.

758
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:39,678
This sounds strange but...

759
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:48,147
...when I gave birth to Takashi,
these beads came out from inside of me.

760
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:52,285
I gave this to Takashi as an amulet.

761
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,587
This actually protected you.

762
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:04,302
It was the same crest as...

763
01:24:14,149 --> 01:24:15,309
Tales of Terror

764
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:24,841
Hello, this is Nakasago.

765
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:28,612
Please, excuse my previous behavior.

766
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:30,719
Yes.

767
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:33,625
Regarding the loan...

768
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:38,859
Could you reconsider?

769
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:43,233
Please...

770
01:27:06,788 --> 01:27:07,880
Yes.

771
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:46,416
Hello, this is Nakasago.

772
01:27:48,396 --> 01:27:49,420
Hello?

773
01:27:51,599 --> 01:27:52,998
Hello?

774
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:55,496
Shiori?

775
01:27:56,371 --> 01:27:57,395
Are you all right?

776
01:27:57,505 --> 01:27:58,767
Dad!

777
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:00,773
What's wrong?

778
01:28:00,875 --> 01:28:02,274
Dad!

779
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:02,741
Shiori.

780
01:28:02,844 --> 01:28:03,572
Dad!

781
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:06,077
What happened to you?

782
01:28:07,081 --> 01:28:09,015
Hey, Shiori!

783
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:10,083
Dad!

784
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:11,050
Shiori!
Dad!

785
01:28:11,586 --> 01:28:13,645
Dad!
