TOMMY: You

00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:19,217
Everybody is dirty

It's all you need.

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,464
This thing is like a license
to take whatever you want.

14
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,092
TOMMY: You snatch up one

15
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,262

00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,396
Oh you make it good dough.

00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,375
But you got to know who
you are fucking with...

00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:41,640
You got cops; you got
gangsters; and all kind of ballers.

19
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,578
TOMMY: And you don't
want to roll the dice

20
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,274
for taking the wrong
nigger's ride.

21
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,818
TOMMY: But if you want
that steady come up...

22
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:48,716
TOMMY: Just keep your eyes

Because no matter of what;

26
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:57,555
they have to bring that
work to the car.

27
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,687
TOMMY: So, if you hit the car

28
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,093
whatever they got
inside is yours.

29
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:05,431

SANDERS: And I thought
about why not you?

158
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:11,768
You know the work.

159
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:15,402
SANDERS: I was going to consider
Doug, but the little junky went,

160
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:19,006
and flunked his piss test.

161
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,312
So... think about it...

162

00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,070
Come over here.

356
00:25:29,261 --> 00:25:30,137
You are not from here huh?

357
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:31,035
Huh hmmm...

358
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,610
Yes and no.

359
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:35,076
I grew up in Sweet-water.

360
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,079
But I'm not like those bitches

361
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:40,010
You know at first I thought
that you and Lisa were sisters?

362
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,277
NIKKI: Me and Lisa
met at Friday's

363
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,985
and she needed a
roommate so I kind of...

364
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,611
NIKKI: Joined her.

365
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,050
Permission to ask
a question sir

366
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:51,988
Go ahead private

367
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,526
What do you want?

368
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:00,192
In life...

369
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,305
What do I want?

370
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:04,936
Mm hum mm...

371
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,103
Well, shit I would
like to pay off

372
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:12,740
that truck. Not that!

373
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:15,716
I don't know, I never
really thought of it.

374
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:19,979
I don't know I guess I would

375
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,258
like to be the opposite
of what people see

376
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,890
I don't know.

377
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:30,626
Tow that family that is
stranded in the rain?

378
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,098
Is that crazy?

379
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,735
No,

380
00:26:36,661 --> 00:26:41,940
I want to be saw in half by
a magician. I took wood shop!

381
00:26:42,033 --> 00:26:45,173
Bull Shit, you took typing.

382
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:52,111
Come on get up

383
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:52,711
Show me your truck.

384
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:54,256
Come on

385
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,346
Raul, stop the truck...

386
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,616
What? Stop the truck please.

387
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,881
Come on!

388
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,302
Yo, Nikki

389
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,764
Nikki, Where are you going?

390
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,400
I was such a dreamer type kid...

391
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,667
You know my mom once
bit me with the water hose?

392
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:25,408
Just because I didn't want
to get out the baby pool...

393
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,211
She almost broke my nose

394
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,388
I remember she drained it...

395
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:42,899
And then I wait for
her to go back inside,

396
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:46,901
so I can fill it up again.

397
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,165
Then she'd yell at me
about the water bill.

398
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:56,173
But I didn't care.

399
00:28:56,468 --> 00:29:01,417
I just wanted to be in there.

400
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,117
Just a little bit longer...

401
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:09,117
A long enough to see

402
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:15,062
if my pruning skin will
turn me into a mermaid

403
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,099
Clearly that didn't happen.

404
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:33,913
What's up?

405
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:39,387
Fuck! You care!

406
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,280
Oye, oye!

407
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:47,828
Since I'm not going to be
around I need you to step it up.

408
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:48,523
Oh! Now you want me to step

409
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,822
up because DeeDee has
your balls in her purse?

410
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,128
Come on! For real Mo...

411
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:53,759
You know you sound just like Mom

412
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:54,529
and that fucking
impossive shit.

413
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,305
You don't even know what the
fuck you are talking about?

414
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:58,374
Listen, I have to raise a
family here, your niece.

415
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,136
And this house it's
too fucking crowed OK?

416
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:01,869
I got to do something
about it OK?

417
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,071
I got to take the lead here...

418
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,842
It's not like I'm
abandoning you OK?

419
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,111
I'm not going to
die like papi did...

420
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:08,343
Yeah!

421
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,248
Well, maybe you should.

422
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:12,247
You fucking bitch

423
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,482
You got no respect

424
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:17,118
How the fuck you dare
to tell me to die!

425
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,286
Do it!

426
00:30:57,088 --> 00:31:01,093
Hey baby Look what I got

427
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,405
I swear to God

428
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:08,944
you... you...

429
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,604
are like, like, like Betty
Crocker bringing me the red

430
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,179
spoon promise Baby

431
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,310
God!

432
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:28,896
So, you still want
to come up with me?

433
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:29,862
No, no, no, no, no...

434
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:33,592
You will see howl come up

435
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:38,570
You need a bitch like me right?

436
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,535
JIMMY: I need a bitch
like you...

437
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,106
Yeah

438
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,553
Damn Neil, you came quick

439
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:57,218
Oh yeah? I
promise...that won't

440
00:31:57,315 --> 00:31:58,953
happen again.

441
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,293
Take a seat; I'll be a minute OK?

442
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:48,466
Where the fuck are you?

443
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,631
Call me...

444
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:53,334
Neil is here

445
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:02,648
Hey! Show me how it's done.

446
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:06,315
What are you talking about?

447
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,804
What happened?

448
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:13,413
NIKKI: So, you like
the white car huh?

449
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:17,324
Yup! A friend of yours?

450
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,395
He will be...

451
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,691
Is that why everybody
loves you huh?

452
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:27,126
You are going to
be my little sidekick!

453
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,326
Shit you are my sidekick honey!

454
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:31,365
Hell no!

455
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,846
What's up?

456
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:54,126
My guy is on his way, and
he should be here soon...

457
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,164
He)', you cool?

458
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:02,227
Because you walking
around, shit bothers me.

459
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:06,365
Strippers do that,
and I got to tip them.

460
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:11,177
You know what I mean?

461
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,237
Hum, Can I get you
a drink or something?

462
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,874
No, no, no, no...let's
do this...

463
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,715
Wait, wait...Hmmm...

464
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:19,152
I think he just text me,

465
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:20,347
Let me see.

466
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,527
NIKKI: What are
we sitting in the dark for...?

467
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,231
NIKKI: Hey!

468
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,894
You want to see what I do?

469
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,968
NIKKI: Yeah!

470
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,268
You are going to set me up?

471
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:27,008
No! huh? I'm gonna let
everyone not to fuck with you...

472
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,377
NEIL: Stupid ass trick!

473
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,400
TOMMY: Congratulations!

474
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,978
TOMMY: Finally got that boy huh?

475
00:38:57,068 --> 00:39:00,515
TOMMY: But now we got
to see what it got.

476
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,312
Do we have a brick?

477
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:03,783
Or do we have a hand
full of shit...

478
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:08,915
Ha ha ha. It's time to play a
little game I like to call.

479
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:13,356
"Strip the Whip"

480
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:16,564
TOMMY: So many choices...

481
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:21,064
TOMMY: We know this boy
is dirty. What will it be?

482
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:25,870
Weed, Guns, Meth, Pills, Money

483
00:39:25,963 --> 00:39:30,912
You can win it all,
but where is it at?

484
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:33,778
RAUL: Let me take a look
in the glove box

485
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:34,782
TOMMY: Is it in the glove box?

486
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,012
TOMMY: No

487
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,589
But feel free to read
the owner's manual...

488
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:41,816
I'm sure you want
to hear about how

489
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,789
to check the oil...don't you?

490
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,795
RAUL: Let me pop the trunk
TOMMY: Let's pop the trunk!

491
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,066
TOMMY: Yeah right

492
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,102
The only thing back
there is a baby stroller

493
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,694
and a spare tire. Come on Man!

494
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,865
You got to be better
than that...

495
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:02,604
RAUL: Let me go to the doors.

496
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,805
TOMMY: If Panel doesn't giggle loose,
move on

497
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:05,847
AUDIENCE: Ohhhhh!

498
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,941
RAUL: It's only a tease...

499
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,646
RAUL: How about the
front seat though.

500
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:16,555
TOMMY: That's a prime spot
for at least a pistol.

501
00:40:16,614 --> 00:40:18,855
All there is here is some
lint and a gum wrapper.

502
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,951
RAUL: The back seat.

503
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:25,990
TOMMY: You are better off
making babies back there boy!

504
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,037
You want to play
with the big dogs,

505
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,867
You need to think
like the pentagon...

506
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,408
James motherfucking Bond

507
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:35,943
That High tech shit!

508
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:36,875
RAUL: Ufff!

509
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,847
RAUL: This bitch got to
have a switch...

510
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,913
TOMMY: Let's hit that
switch And claim that price

511
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:52,461
Because the hydraulic
stash box is like hitting the lotto.

512
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,507
What the fuck!

513
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,167
I've been calling you and
calling you, and Neil got

514
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,838
to go somewhere else and I was
fucking stuck with this shit.

515
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:46,039
RAUL: Can you call him back?

516
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:46,808
No I can't.

517
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:47,212
Yes you can!

518
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:47,976
LISA: Shut the fuck up.

519
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:48,812
LISA: You don't get it...

520
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:51,911
I fucking told you this
I put you down my people,

521
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,751
my connects and you
fucked it up.

522
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,118
It's like you are a little kid.

523
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,691
Relax Lisa. No, fuck that!

524
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,885
I got you out here
to make money.

525
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,121
I got to make my paper and
you made me look like a dick

526
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:04,062
in front of Neil, because you are
fucking around with this bitch!

527
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,895
Who are you fucking
talking to Bitch!

528
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:06,500
Hey! What the fuck?

529
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:07,235
Hey...Hey...

530
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:08,896
chill the fuck up, Chill, Chill

531
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,238
I'm going to handle this shit.

532
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:15,868

00:54:59,029 --> 00:54:59,939
Like this.

757
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:03,309
Ha, ha, ha, let's go.

758
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:11,885
SLEVANA: Hey, what are
you doing with my bag?

759
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:12,749
Those are my clothes.

760
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:15,015
Look baby, you are getting
ready to marry a rich American,

761
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:18,452

I'm telling you man these
mail order brides take it

00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,332
to the old school
way of things man,

764
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:25,923
all you got to do is put
a roof over their head.

765
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:28,002
Come home and fuck, ha, ha, ha.

766
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:30,038
I can get you a good deal.

767
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:32,573
I'm good Vlad, I don't need
to buy a Russian bride.

768
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,732
Look man, all these
women out here.

769
00:55:33,797 --> 00:55:35,936
It's just as bought and paid
for man, But is all disguised

770
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:38,808
into some bullshit
courtship, you understand?

771
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:40,973
Why settle for mutt
bucket domestic

772
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,516
When you can get
top dime import

773
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:43,606

What's this?

775
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,584
What did you do with the
rest of my shit Vlad?

776
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,486
I had a client man, he
was on some bad wiring

777
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:50,455
and he didn't want
to take the plunge.

778
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:51,719
But listen I got my boy
Neil on deck, all right?

779
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:52,851
Yo man, stop that shit.

780

I knew I've never fucking
fronted you anything man

781
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:58,393
Hey look when did I ever
try you about money, man?

782
00:55:58,488 --> 00:55:58,829
Don't touch me.

783
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,630
When did I ever try you
about money, man, ah?

784
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,669
Stop telling me one thing

785
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:04,933

fucking stringing me along

786
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:05,369
all day.

787
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:06,805
Knowing you were not going
to have my fucking money

788
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,706
Stringing you along,
stringing you all?

789
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:10,038
You needed to hang out
man; you are walking

790
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,670
around like your dog died ok?

791
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:12,974
I tried to cheer
you up by witnessing

792
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:14,343
all my glory. I got
to be honest Ra...

793
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:15,916
You are kind of pissing
on the parade man.

794
00:56:15,972 --> 00:56:20,421
Your parade is balling
on my fucking expense.

795
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:21,751
And you are making excuses.

796
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:23,552
Stop feeding me bullshit Vlad.

797
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:24,750
You ain't got my back Raul?

798
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:26,521
When the fuck did I show
you anything different?

799
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:30,690
That's what I'm saying...trust
me. I don't trust that shit.

800
00:56:30,754 --> 00:56:32,028
Why not?

801
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,699
You are a fucking fraud.

802
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:38,399
Everybody knows that shit
You exaggerate everything

803
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:39,496
in your life and walk

804
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:40,574
around like you are
someone you are not.

805
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:41,698
Get the fuck out of here...

806
00:56:41,765 --> 00:56:44,575
you shit. OK, whatever, let
me tell you something man.

807
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:45,840
At least I'm living my dream.

808
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:46,709
What dream?

809
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:48,714
And I'm not a some selfish trip.

810
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:51,685
My boys are my boys
and they got my back.

811
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,515

812
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:53,417

Huh? Did you?

829
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:50,575

a piece of shit.

835
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:21,170
MARCO: Jimmy, you can
keep that little bitch.

836

You are full of shit.
