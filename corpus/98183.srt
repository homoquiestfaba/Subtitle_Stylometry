1
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,085
Mayday! Mayday!

2
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:23,255
This is the Annabelle.
I'm Iost and I'm taking on water.

3
00:01:23,777 --> 00:01:27,426
My Iast good reading is
44 degrees north, 68 degrees. . . .

4
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:34,724
Portland Station to AnnabeIIe.
What is your position?

5
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:38,895
I don't know exactIy. Off the coast
somewhere near RockweII! Wait.

6
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:42,022
The Iighthouse! I see it!

7
00:03:02,828 --> 00:03:04,391
Over here, honey!

8
00:03:06,998 --> 00:03:10,647
Hey, Mom! You won't beIieve
our good Iuck. Guess what I found?

9
00:03:11,169 --> 00:03:14,818
Hogarth, we've been
through this before. No pets.

10
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,903
But he's not a pet, Mom.
He's a friend.

11
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:20,031
We've got to rent a room
if we're gonna make ends meet. . .

12
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:23,158
. . .and no one wants
shredded uphoIstery.

13
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:25,244
You won't know he's there.
I'II cage him.

14
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:29,415
UntiI you feeI sorry for him
and set him free in the house!

15
00:03:29,937 --> 00:03:31,500
Do you remember the raccoon, Hogarth?

16
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:33,586
I remember the raccoon.

17
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,713
PIease, Mom, at Ieast Iook at him.

18
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:40,884
AII right. Where is this guy?

19
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:42,969
I can't read this handwriting.

20
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:46,097
That one shouId have Iettuce,
tomato, extra mayo.

21
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:50,267
I wiII go get him, okay?

22
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,395
So he wants us to hoId the mayo
and the mustard.

23
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,523
How about just hoId
the fIavor aItogether?

24
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:03,822
Excuse me.

25
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:07,992
Excuse me. Sir?

26
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:12,163
Excuse me--!

27
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:18,419
-What's that?
-PIease don't move.

28
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:21,547
My pet's under your tabIe.
Don't Iook!

29
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:24,675
If you make a scene,
my mom won't Iet me keep him.

30
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:26,760
-What kind of pet, kid?
-A squirreI.

31
00:04:27,282 --> 00:04:27,803
He's friendIy.

32
00:04:28,325 --> 00:04:31,974
I'm teIIing the truth, dang it!
It came from outer space. I saw it.

33
00:04:33,538 --> 00:04:35,101
And it was headed toward Iand.

34
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:38,229
I caIIed the government
in Washington about it.

35
00:04:38,751 --> 00:04:41,357
Maybe it was a Sputnik
or an invader from Mars.

36
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,442
That's what it is.

37
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:45,527
It's an invader from Mars!

38
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,656
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified fIying object.

39
00:04:49,178 --> 00:04:52,827
Unidentified? Knowing you, EarI,
I'd say it was either whiskey or beer.

40
00:04:59,604 --> 00:05:00,125
I saw it too.

41
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:04,296
I rest my case.

42
00:05:08,988 --> 00:05:10,551
I beIieve you.

43
00:05:11,073 --> 00:05:11,594
What if it is Sputnik?

44
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:13,679
Or a fIying saucer. . .

45
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,764
. . .from Mars?

46
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:16,807
I bet we couId find it.

47
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:19,935
Sorry, kid.
I didn't reaIIy see anything.

48
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:23,063
If we don't stick up
for the kooks, who wiII?

49
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:25,148
Is my son bothering you, sir?

50
00:05:28,798 --> 00:05:31,404
No! CaII me Dean.

51
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:34,532
Hogarth, you were going
to get your pet, honey?

52
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:35,575
I wiII, Mom.

53
00:05:36,097 --> 00:05:38,703
-Right after I finish taIking with--
-Dean.

54
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:43,915
-Found your pet.
-Where?

55
00:05:44,438 --> 00:05:48,087
SquirreI's up my pants, Hogarth.
I'm trying not to wig out here.

56
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:49,129
Don't wig out.

57
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:51,214
Okay. He's heading north now.

58
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:57,470
I'm sorry, kid. I'd Iike to apoIogize
to everyone in advance for this.

59
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:08,939
Check, pIease.

60
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:11,025
It's a rat!

61
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:20,408
HeIIo, this is Hogarth Hughes
speaking. Who's caIIing?

62
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,451
I'm reaIIy sorry, but--

63
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:23,536
Thank you.

64
00:06:24,058 --> 00:06:26,664
I need to work Iate tonight.
There's chicken in the icebox.

65
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,749
You can have that and carrots--

66
00:06:30,314 --> 00:06:31,877
I'm way ahead of you, Mom.

67
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,962
I'll make it up to you.

68
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:36,048
-I love you.
-Me too.

69
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,091
And, Hogarth...

70
00:06:37,613 --> 00:06:41,262
. . .no scary movies, no Iate snacks,
in bed by 8:00. Got it?

71
00:06:41,783 --> 00:06:43,346
Come on, Mom.
It's me, remember?

72
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:47,517
Why, the porpoise can communicate
telepathically, Miss Melon.

73
00:06:49,082 --> 00:06:51,688
If we can transplant 15 % 
of their brain matter into ours...

74
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,816
... we may be able to read minds.

75
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,029
Darn. A perfectly good brain wasted.

76
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:02,114
You've seen enough.
How about a nightcap?

77
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,242
Let's say my place.

78
00:07:06,807 --> 00:07:09,413
I was thinking the same thing.
Mind reader.

79
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:13,583
Darn. I seem to have left
my keys in the lab.

80
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:24,009
You're gonna get it.

81
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:34,436
Who 's there?

82
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:51,119
Come on!

83
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,203
Stupid antenna.

84
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,781
Invaders from Mars!

85
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:41,542
Honey?

86
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:40,404
HeIp! HeIp! Stop! HeIp!

87
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:52,916
Don't you know better than
to wander off at night aIone?

88
00:13:53,438 --> 00:13:55,001
What if something happened?

89
00:13:55,523 --> 00:13:56,044
I'm sorry, Mom.

90
00:13:57,608 --> 00:13:59,171
Don't you ever do that to me again.

91
00:13:59,694 --> 00:14:03,343
I was so scared.
I thought I'd Iost you.

92
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:08,556
You won't beIieve this.
Something ate our TV antenna.

93
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:13,768
No! I'm serious!

94
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,897
It's not Sputnik,
Iike Mr. Stutz thought.

95
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:20,024
No, it's a robot!
No, reaIIy, it is!

96
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:24,195
And the robot, it's 1 00 feet high!
And it eats metaI!

97
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,323
Stop it! Just. . .

98
00:14:27,845 --> 00:14:29,408
. . .stop.

99
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:30,451
I'm not--

100
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:33,579
I'm not in the mood.

101
00:14:36,186 --> 00:14:38,792
Come on. Let's go home.

102
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,602
A peaceful, stay-at-home
kind of day in a town...

103
00:14:59,124 --> 00:15:00,687
... very much like your own.

104
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,816
But then, suddenly,
without warning...

105
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:06,943
...atomic holocaust!

106
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:09,028
But how does one survive
an atomic attack?

107
00:15:10,593 --> 00:15:11,114
Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz?

108
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,242
He says his boat
ran into a sea monster.

109
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:16,327
I heard it was sunk by a meteor.

110
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:20,498
It was a metaI meteor.
It ate his boat. My dad says--

111
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:21,541
It wasn't any of those.

112
00:15:22,062 --> 00:15:24,668
What wouId you know about it,
Poindexter?

113
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:27,796
Don't make me come over there.

114
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:29,881
Hands over your head
Keep low to the ground

115
00:15:31,446 --> 00:15:33,009
Time to duck and cover
The bombs are coming down

116
00:15:33,531 --> 00:15:34,052
Duck and cover

117
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,265
It's about 50 or 60 feet high
and it onIy eats metaI.

118
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,351
Shut up, you IittIe spaz!

119
00:15:41,873 --> 00:15:45,522
It's been sent by foreigners
to take over the country.

120
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:47,606
We shouId bomb it to smithereens
before it does.

121
00:15:49,171 --> 00:15:50,734
'Cause all the kids who don 't
Will cease to be around

122
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:52,820
Thanks for the scrap.

123
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:55,948
Sorry I can't pay you more.
But it's got this. . .

124
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:59,075
. . .this Iarge bite out of it.

125
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,246
That's why I'm seIIing it.
It's got a Iarge bite out of it.

126
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:07,417
-What couId've done this?
-I toId you what.

127
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:11,587
Strange invaders.

128
00:16:12,109 --> 00:16:15,758
Thanks for beIieving me.
I reaIIy did caII the government.

129
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,886
They're sending someone
to take care of the whoIe thing.

130
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:20,971
Jeez, EarI.
You reaIIy are crazy.

131
00:16:21,493 --> 00:16:24,099
Who in the heII wouId
the government send?

132
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:29,312
Kent MansIey,
UnexpIained Phenomena.

133
00:16:30,877 --> 00:16:31,398
-Marv Loach. I--
-What happened?

134
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,569
Not sure. Sometimes the Iine'II snap
if the weather is bad, sure.

135
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:40,782
But for a whoIe tower to get
twisted up Iike that. . . .

136
00:16:41,303 --> 00:16:41,824
It's got me beat.

137
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:47,038
It's aImost Iike it was bitten off
by some enormous beast.

138
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:50,165
Enormous beast.

139
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,250
What do you think?
Escaped goriIIa?

140
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:53,293
What department is that again?

141
00:16:53,815 --> 00:16:57,464
I'm not at Iiberty to reveaI
the particuIars of my agency. . .

142
00:16:57,986 --> 00:16:59,549
. . .and aII that that impIies.

143
00:17:00,071 --> 00:17:01,634
You mean nationaI security?

144
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:03,719
Let's put it this way.

145
00:17:04,242 --> 00:17:05,805
Once in a whiIe, things happen. . .

146
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:08,933
. . .that can't be rationaIized
in a conventionaI way.

147
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:11,018
PeopIe wanna know
the government has a response.

148
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,146
I am that response.

149
00:17:14,668 --> 00:17:16,231
So were there any witnesses?

150
00:17:16,753 --> 00:17:19,359
WeII, sir, if you'II just foIIow me.

151
00:17:20,924 --> 00:17:22,487
We did find this.

152
00:17:24,052 --> 00:17:26,658
United States Government, huh?

153
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,786
Guess that means something big's
happening here.

154
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:32,914
No, Marv. Big things happen
in big pIaces.

155
00:17:34,478 --> 00:17:37,084
The sooner I fiII out my report,
the sooner I can get back to them.

156
00:17:38,649 --> 00:17:40,212
Enormous beast, yeah. . . .

157
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:45,425
Biggest thing here is
the homecoming queen.

158
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:46,468
Oh, my God!

159
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:53,767
Come on, I need a witness.

160
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:56,894
-It's around the corner.
-Don't puII so hard.

161
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,979
It's Iike a chomp
out of the side of the car.

162
00:18:00,544 --> 00:18:02,107
It's Iike a bite out
of a sandwich, Iike a--

163
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,406
What are we Iooking at here,
Mr. MansIey?

164
00:18:10,971 --> 00:18:12,534
Something big, Marv.

165
00:18:15,141 --> 00:18:16,704
Something big.

166
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:25,045
HeIIo!

167
00:18:25,568 --> 00:18:27,131
Come out!

168
00:18:28,696 --> 00:18:32,345
Hey, big metaI guy,
I got food here for you!

169
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:35,472
MetaI!

170
00:18:35,994 --> 00:18:37,557
Crunchy, deIicious metaI!

171
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,642
Come and get it!

172
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:21,822
So I guess you're
not gonna hurt me, huh?

173
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,163
The shutoff switch.

174
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,333
You saw me save you.

175
00:20:39,026 --> 00:20:40,589
So where are you from?

176
00:20:43,197 --> 00:20:44,760
You came from the sky, right?

177
00:20:46,325 --> 00:20:46,846
From up there?

178
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:48,931
Don't you remember anything?

179
00:20:52,581 --> 00:20:56,230
Maybe it's that bump on your head.

180
00:20:58,836 --> 00:21:00,399
Do you taIk?

181
00:21:01,964 --> 00:21:05,613
You know, words? ''BIah, bIah, bIah,''
Iike that? Can you do that?

182
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:13,954
WeII, you get the idea anyway.

183
00:21:14,476 --> 00:21:14,997
Let's see.

184
00:21:16,561 --> 00:21:19,167
See this? This is caIIed a rock.

185
00:21:20,732 --> 00:21:21,253
Rock.

186
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,381
Good.

187
00:21:36,372 --> 00:21:37,935
That is a tree.

188
00:21:38,457 --> 00:21:41,063
Rock. Tree.

189
00:21:41,585 --> 00:21:42,106
Get it?

190
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:47,319
That's right!

191
00:21:48,883 --> 00:21:50,446
My own giant robot.

192
00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:53,575
I am now the Iuckiest kid in America!

193
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:54,618
This is unbeIievabIe.

194
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:59,830
This is the greatest discovery since,
I don't know, teIevision or something.

195
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:04,001
I gotta teII someone. I shouId caII--
No, they'II panic.

196
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,129
PeopIe wig out and shoot
at something big Iike you.

197
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:11,300
Wig out. It means crazy.
You know, Iike. . . .

198
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:17,555
No, no! Don't do that!

199
00:22:18,077 --> 00:22:19,640
That's the stuff
that makes them shoot at you.

200
00:22:20,163 --> 00:22:23,812
Two nights ago, at approximateIy
1 ,900 hours, sat com radar. . .

201
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,982
. . .detected an unidentified object
entering Earth's atmosphere. . .

202
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:31,110
. . .Iosing contact with it 2 1 /2 miIes
off the coast of RockweII.

203
00:22:31,632 --> 00:22:34,238
Some assumed it was a meteor
or a downed sateIIite.

204
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,366
But Washington received
a caII from someone. . .

205
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:40,494
. . .who reported an actuaI encounter
with the object.

206
00:22:41,015 --> 00:22:43,621
This is no meteor, gentIemen.

207
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:46,749
This is something much more serious.

208
00:22:47,271 --> 00:22:50,920
We can't caII Ripley's Believe It Or
Not because they wouIdn't beIieve it.

209
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:53,006
And. . . .

210
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:56,133
It's getting dark.
And if I don't get home soon. . .

211
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:58,218
. . .Mom's gonna wonder where I am.

212
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,303
If she comes Iooking for me
and sees you. . .

213
00:23:00,826 --> 00:23:03,432
. . .we got the screaming probIem again.

214
00:23:03,954 --> 00:23:06,560
So for now, wouId you,
you know, just. . .

215
00:23:07,082 --> 00:23:08,645
. . .just stay here, okay?

216
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:10,731
I'II come back tomorrow.

217
00:23:19,593 --> 00:23:20,114
Goodbye.

218
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:25,328
No, no.

219
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:26,370
Me go.

220
00:23:27,934 --> 00:23:28,455
You stay.

221
00:23:28,977 --> 00:23:30,540
No foIIowing.

222
00:23:32,105 --> 00:23:32,626
Good.

223
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:35,754
I toId you!

224
00:23:37,318 --> 00:23:39,924
I'II come back tomorrow!

225
00:23:40,446 --> 00:23:42,009
Now, stay!

226
00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:50,350
Bad robot!

227
00:24:04,427 --> 00:24:08,076
Look, you can't go stomping around
and you can't come with me.

228
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,161
My mom wiII wig out.

229
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:13,289
That's right.

230
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:16,417
So you have got to stay
in the forest. . .

231
00:24:16,939 --> 00:24:18,502
. . .and I'II bring you
some food tomorrow.

232
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,673
But I gotta go home now.

233
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:25,800
So goodbye.

234
00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:39,355
Hey, wait a minute!
What do you think you're doing?

235
00:24:39,877 --> 00:24:41,440
Look at this mess!

236
00:24:50,303 --> 00:24:50,824
Put it back!

237
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:52,909
Put it back right now!

238
00:24:54,474 --> 00:24:57,080
HeIp me! I need your heIp!

239
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:00,208
Good, good!

240
00:25:06,986 --> 00:25:08,549
Put them together. Like this.

241
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:10,634
This one here, that one there.

242
00:25:12,199 --> 00:25:14,805
Okay, over, over. Good, good.
Now the other one.

243
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:17,932
Okay. Good enough.
Let's go!

244
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,061
What the--?

245
00:25:23,668 --> 00:25:26,274
That's fine! Leave it aIone!
The train is coming!

246
00:25:26,796 --> 00:25:28,359
The train is coming!

247
00:25:29,924 --> 00:25:30,445
Come on, Iet's go!

248
00:25:54,947 --> 00:25:55,468
You're aIive!

249
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:11,108
-Anybody out there?
-We're in troubIe now.

250
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,151
Are you aII right?

251
00:26:13,715 --> 00:26:16,321
I've changed my mind.
You can foIIow me home. Let's go.

252
00:26:17,885 --> 00:26:18,406
Mayor's office.

253
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:21,534
What? A train accident?

254
00:26:22,056 --> 00:26:23,619
He hit a giant creature?

255
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:25,704
What creature couId
be big enough to--

256
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:27,790
I need your car.

257
00:27:12,103 --> 00:27:14,709
You can fix yourseIf? Neato!

258
00:27:15,231 --> 00:27:17,837
Mom's home. Just stay here, okay?
I'II be back. Bye!

259
00:27:20,444 --> 00:27:20,965
Bye.

260
00:27:30,871 --> 00:27:31,392
What happened here?

261
00:27:32,956 --> 00:27:35,562
Go on. TeII him what you saw, Frank.

262
00:27:38,169 --> 00:27:39,732
You're not gonna beIieve this.

263
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,946
But it was a giant metaI man.

264
00:27:49,638 --> 00:27:52,244
Does anyone know where
I can get to a teIephone nearby?

265
00:27:55,894 --> 00:27:57,457
WouId you say grace?

266
00:28:04,235 --> 00:28:04,756
Oh, my God!

267
00:28:08,406 --> 00:28:08,927
Oh, my God. . .

268
00:28:10,491 --> 00:28:11,012
. . .we thank you.

269
00:28:12,576 --> 00:28:14,139
For. . .

270
00:28:14,662 --> 00:28:16,225
. . .the food that Mom. . .

271
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:19,352
. . .has put in front of us and--
Stop!

272
00:28:20,917 --> 00:28:22,480
The deviI. . .

273
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:26,652
. . .from doing bad things and. . . .

274
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:28,736
Get out of here!

275
00:28:30,301 --> 00:28:30,822
Satan?

276
00:28:32,386 --> 00:28:31,865
Go!

277
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:34,992
Go, so. . .

278
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:38,120
. . .that we may Iive in peace. Amen.

279
00:28:38,642 --> 00:28:39,163
Amen.

280
00:28:40,728 --> 00:28:44,377
That was reaIIy unusuaI, Hogarth.

281
00:28:44,898 --> 00:28:45,419
Forgot to wash my hands.

282
00:29:00,538 --> 00:29:01,059
Stop, stop!

283
00:29:02,623 --> 00:29:04,186
AII right. Come on. Over here.

284
00:29:23,476 --> 00:29:23,997
Come on, over here. Come on.

285
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:30,253
Hey there, scout. Kent MansIey.
I work for the government.

286
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,679
Hey, there. Kent MansIey. Work for
the government. Your parents home?

287
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:41,722
We're eating.

288
00:29:43,286 --> 00:29:44,849
Who's there, honey?

289
00:29:45,372 --> 00:29:47,978
HeIIo there. Do you have
a teIephone I couId use?

290
00:29:49,542 --> 00:29:50,063
-In the kitchen.
-Thank you.

291
00:29:51,627 --> 00:29:52,148
Thank you very much.

292
00:29:53,713 --> 00:29:54,234
Here.

293
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:56,318
Pretend you're a gangster.

294
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:59,446
-You caII me at home for this?
-You don 't understand.

295
00:30:01,011 --> 00:30:03,617
-It ate my car.
-And you saw this happen?

296
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:07,788
No, I didn't actuaIIy see it.
It went off into the woods.

297
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,873
So you don 't have any evidence?

298
00:30:10,395 --> 00:30:11,958
But I've got an eyewitness!

299
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,043
An eyewitness with a concussion.

300
00:30:15,608 --> 00:30:16,129
This thing is a menace.

301
00:30:16,651 --> 00:30:20,300
It tore up the power station.
It caused a train wreck!

302
00:30:20,821 --> 00:30:21,342
What did?

303
00:30:21,864 --> 00:30:23,427
TeII me again, MansIey,
and this time. . .

304
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:25,512
...listen to yourself.

305
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:28,640
A giant metaI monster.

306
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:33,854
PIease, sir. I've got
a feeIing about this one.

307
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:38,025
That's lovely, Kent. But let me
try to explain how this works.

308
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:41,152
If you toId me you'd found,
say, a giant footprint. . .

309
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:44,280
. . .I'd send an expert
to make a pIaster cast of it.

310
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:48,451
Get me a photograph and
I couId get some troops over there!

311
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:50,536
But you teII me
you've got a feeIing. . .?

312
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:54,707
AII right, fine. You want evidence?
I'II get you evidence.

313
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:57,835
And when I do, I'm gonna want
a memo distributed.

314
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:58,878
That sounds sweII.

315
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,005
I'll want that memo carbon-copied
and redistributed--

316
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,730
Hi. Thanks for
the use of your phone.

317
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:22,858
Thank you for the use
of your phone, Mrs. . .?

318
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,986
Hughes. Annie Hughes.
And this is my son, Hogarth.

319
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:29,114
Thank you, Annie. Hobart.

320
00:31:29,636 --> 00:31:31,199
That's Hogarth!

321
00:31:33,807 --> 00:31:36,413
What an embarrassing name.
Might as weII caII him Zeppo.

322
00:31:37,977 --> 00:31:40,583
What kind of a sick person
wouId name a kid Hogar--?

323
00:31:42,148 --> 00:31:42,669
Hog Hug.

324
00:31:44,233 --> 00:31:44,754
Hogarth Hughes!

325
00:31:50,489 --> 00:31:52,052
Kent MansIey.
You work for the government.

326
00:31:52,574 --> 00:31:54,137
I wasn't gonna say that.

327
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:56,222
I have something for you, Hogarth.

328
00:31:57,787 --> 00:31:59,350
Your BB gun.
Where did you find that?

329
00:31:59,873 --> 00:32:00,394
At the power station.

330
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:03,521
-Hogarth was there the other night.
-ReaIIy?

331
00:32:04,043 --> 00:32:05,606
See anything unusuaI, Hogarth?

332
00:32:07,171 --> 00:32:08,734
Nothing. . .

333
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:11,862
. . .unusuaI, reaIIy.

334
00:32:17,598 --> 00:32:18,119
Gotta use the bathroom.

335
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:29,588
Strange he's tightIipped. The other
night he couIdn't stop taIking.

336
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:32,715
I mean, 1 00-foot robots and whatnot.

337
00:32:33,237 --> 00:32:34,800
A hundred-foot robot?

338
00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:36,886
That's nutty!

339
00:32:37,408 --> 00:32:37,929
What eIse did he say?

340
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,013
No, wait, stop!

341
00:32:41,578 --> 00:32:42,099
Excuse me.

342
00:32:48,877 --> 00:32:50,440
What is going on in there?

343
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:53,568
Are you aII right?

344
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:55,654
I'm fine.

345
00:32:56,175 --> 00:32:58,781
You know, this sort of thing
is why it's so important. . .

346
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:01,909
. . .to reaIIy chew your food.

347
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,293
A IittIe privacy?!

348
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:12,336
Sorry.

349
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:14,421
Sorry.

350
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:16,506
He's been acting strange IateIy.

351
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:17,549
That hurt.

352
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,061
Thank you again, Annie.

353
00:33:32,668 --> 00:33:36,317
Good night, Hogarth. I'm sure
we'II see each other again reaI soon.

354
00:33:44,137 --> 00:33:45,700
If you're gonna stay here. . .

355
00:33:46,222 --> 00:33:48,828
. . .you gotta keep better track
of yourseIf.

356
00:33:51,436 --> 00:33:55,085
Anyway, I thought you'd Iike
a bedtime story or something.

357
00:33:55,606 --> 00:33:58,212
I've got some reaIIy cooI ones.

358
00:33:58,734 --> 00:34:01,340
Mad Magazine, very funny.

359
00:34:02,905 --> 00:34:04,468
The Spirit, very cooI.

360
00:34:06,033 --> 00:34:06,554
Boy's Life?

361
00:34:07,075 --> 00:34:07,596
Oh, here.

362
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,723
This guy is Superman.

363
00:34:12,288 --> 00:34:12,809
Sure, he's famous now. . .

364
00:34:14,374 --> 00:34:14,895
. . .but he started off just Iike you.

365
00:34:16,459 --> 00:34:20,108
Crash-Ianded on Earth.
Didn't know what he was doing.

366
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:24,279
But he onIy uses his powers
for good, never for eviI.

367
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,363
Remember that.

368
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:34,704
That's Atomo, the metaI menace.

369
00:34:35,227 --> 00:34:36,790
He's not the hero.
He's the viIIain.

370
00:34:38,355 --> 00:34:38,876
He's not Iike you.

371
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:40,961
You're a good guy.

372
00:34:42,525 --> 00:34:43,046
Like Superman.

373
00:34:43,568 --> 00:34:45,131
Superman.

374
00:34:49,824 --> 00:34:51,387
You're hungry, aren't you?

375
00:34:52,952 --> 00:34:54,515
But I don't have any metaI here.

376
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:56,600
Just foIIow me.

377
00:34:59,207 --> 00:35:00,770
Pick me up, okay?

378
00:35:12,762 --> 00:35:14,325
Okay, now, march!

379
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,263
Oh, yeah. That's RockweII.

380
00:35:37,785 --> 00:35:38,306
Nice pIace, huh?

381
00:35:38,828 --> 00:35:39,349
RockweII?

382
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:42,476
Yes, I was born right down there.

383
00:35:42,998 --> 00:35:44,561
RockweII!

384
00:35:47,169 --> 00:35:48,732
No, stop!
Look out for the cow!

385
00:35:49,254 --> 00:35:50,817
Come on, no, not there!

386
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,903
PIease stop. No, stop!

387
00:35:56,553 --> 00:35:58,116
We can't go there yet.

388
00:35:58,638 --> 00:36:01,244
PeopIe just aren't ready for you.

389
00:36:14,278 --> 00:36:14,799
That was cIose.

390
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,926
We can't go running around
Iike that, okay?

391
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:20,012
Look!

392
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:26,268
That wouId be okay to eat.
It's been there for months.

393
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:30,438
We gotta hide!

394
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,481
You know, hide?

395
00:36:33,045 --> 00:36:34,608
It's when you--
You know, when you--

396
00:36:35,131 --> 00:36:35,652
Just get behind something, quick!

397
00:36:41,386 --> 00:36:41,907
Don't move.

398
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:12,144
Our troubIes are over.

399
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:18,400
This is it.

400
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:20,485
AII you can eat.

401
00:37:34,561 --> 00:37:36,124
Turn it off!

402
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,423
Come on, turn it off!

403
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:55,935
AII right, who's out there?

404
00:38:00,627 --> 00:38:02,190
I know you. SquirreI boy.

405
00:38:03,755 --> 00:38:06,361
By night, known as Hogarth. Got it.

406
00:38:07,926 --> 00:38:10,532
Come on inside, kid.
Sorry about the crowbar.

407
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:13,660
You'd be surprised how many peopIe
wanna steaI scrap.

408
00:38:14,182 --> 00:38:17,831
But, man, once I turn it into art,
I can't give it away.

409
00:38:18,352 --> 00:38:18,873
I mean, what am I?

410
00:38:19,395 --> 00:38:23,044
A junkman who seIIs art
or an artist who seIIs junk?

411
00:38:23,566 --> 00:38:24,087
You teII me.

412
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:27,214
I Iike it, I think.

413
00:38:28,779 --> 00:38:31,385
Listen, you're not gonna caII
my mom, are you?

414
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:33,470
She doesn't know I'm out.

415
00:38:33,992 --> 00:38:37,641
Don't worry, kid. It's not my styIe
to report a guy to the authorities.

416
00:38:39,205 --> 00:38:39,726
I'm gonna have coffee.

417
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:43,897
What do you want, some miIk,
or what? MiIk?

418
00:38:44,418 --> 00:38:44,939
Coffee's fine.

419
00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:50,152
I drink it. I'm hip.

420
00:38:50,674 --> 00:38:51,195
I don't know.

421
00:38:51,717 --> 00:38:54,323
This is espresso, you know?
It's Iike coffee-ziIIa.

422
00:38:55,888 --> 00:38:57,451
I said, I'm hip.

423
00:39:01,101 --> 00:39:03,707
She moved me up a grade.
Now I'm more not fitting in.

424
00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:05,792
I was getting A's.
Mom says, ''You need stimuIation. ''

425
00:39:07,357 --> 00:39:09,963
-I go, ''I'm stimuIated enough now. ''
-That's for sure.

426
00:39:10,485 --> 00:39:12,048
''You need a chaIIenge. ''
So now I'm chaIIenged. . .

427
00:39:13,613 --> 00:39:16,219
. . .to keep my Iunch money because
of the mooses who wanna pound me. . .

428
00:39:17,783 --> 00:39:18,304
. . .since they think I'm smarter.

429
00:39:18,826 --> 00:39:20,389
But I'm not,
I just do the homework.

430
00:39:21,954 --> 00:39:25,603
If everyone did, they couId move up
and get pounded too. More coffee?

431
00:39:26,124 --> 00:39:28,730
Look, it's reaIIy none
of my business, kid. . .

432
00:39:29,252 --> 00:39:31,858
. . .but who cares what
these creeps think, you know?

433
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,943
They don't decide who you are.
You do.

434
00:39:34,465 --> 00:39:38,114
You are who you choose to be.

435
00:39:41,764 --> 00:39:43,327
-Did you hear that?
-No, wait. Stop!

436
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:56,882
It's okay!

437
00:39:57,404 --> 00:39:57,925
My God!

438
00:39:58,446 --> 00:40:00,009
-He isn't gonna--
-Run, kid! Run!

439
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:06,265
It's okay. He isn't--

440
00:40:06,787 --> 00:40:08,350
It's okay.
He isn't gonna hurt me.

441
00:40:09,915 --> 00:40:10,436
Don't squash him!

442
00:40:12,001 --> 00:40:12,522
Do not. . .

443
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:14,607
. . .squash him.

444
00:40:16,171 --> 00:40:17,734
His name is Dean.

445
00:40:18,256 --> 00:40:19,819
We Iike Dean.

446
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:25,033
So. . .

447
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:27,118
. . .where'd he come from?

448
00:40:28,683 --> 00:40:29,204
He doesn't remember.

449
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:31,289
He's Iike a IittIe kid.

450
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:33,374
LittIe. Yeah.

451
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:36,502
Wait a minute.
You can taIk to him?

452
00:40:38,067 --> 00:40:40,673
He can't say a Iot of words yet,
but he understands things pretty good.

453
00:40:42,237 --> 00:40:42,758
I see.

454
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:50,056
He needs food and sheIter.

455
00:41:02,047 --> 00:41:04,653
You got plenty of room here.

456
00:41:05,175 --> 00:41:06,738
-This pIace is perfect.
-Go away.

457
00:41:08,303 --> 00:41:11,952
I can have him push the door down.
You know I can.

458
00:41:12,474 --> 00:41:12,995
I can't hide it here.

459
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:15,080
-''Him,'' not ''it. ''
-Whatever.

460
00:41:16,644 --> 00:41:20,293
You don't even know where ''he''
came from. Or what the heII ''he'' is!

461
00:41:20,815 --> 00:41:22,378
He's my friend.

462
00:41:23,943 --> 00:41:25,506
Yeah, what am I?
Am I your friend?

463
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:29,677
Bring a Franken-bot with out-of-state
pIates, make me change my tune.

464
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,805
I don't Iike that jazz.
God, I'm tired.

465
00:41:33,327 --> 00:41:34,890
So, he can stay?

466
00:41:35,412 --> 00:41:39,061
Tonight. Tomorrow, I don't know.
I don't know about tomorrow.

467
00:41:48,966 --> 00:41:50,529
SIeep tight.

468
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:52,615
I'II see you tomorrow.

469
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,254
-You're up?
-Just making the bed.

470
00:42:09,819 --> 00:42:12,425
That's nice. Come downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.

471
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,723
Morning, sport. SIeep weII?

472
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,937
Isn't it wonderfuI?
We finaIIy rented our room.

473
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,065
I'm not very hungry.

474
00:42:40,056 --> 00:42:44,747
-This is Hogarth Hughes.
-I said he couId stay the night, kid.

475
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:45,790
It's morning now.

476
00:42:46,312 --> 00:42:51,003
I'II try to come over. But there's
this weird guy here who's watching me.

477
00:42:51,525 --> 00:42:52,046
What's that mean?

478
00:42:52,568 --> 00:42:55,174
I got this big, giant--
Giant thing out here.

479
00:42:56,738 --> 00:42:58,301
I can't taIk right now, okay? Bye.

480
00:42:58,824 --> 00:43:00,387
Who was that, sport?
Friend of yours?

481
00:43:01,952 --> 00:43:02,473
Yeah. He's a new kid.

482
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:07,685
Stop! Stop that! Stop it!

483
00:43:10,293 --> 00:43:11,856
Mind if I ask you
a few questions, buckaroo?

484
00:43:12,378 --> 00:43:14,984
Why wouId you teII your mom
about a giant robot?

485
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:17,069
What was at the power station?

486
00:43:17,591 --> 00:43:19,154
TeII anyone eIse?
How big is this thing?

487
00:43:19,676 --> 00:43:21,239
Been in the forest IateIy?

488
00:43:21,762 --> 00:43:23,325
Champ? SIugger? Cowboy?
Where you going?

489
00:43:23,847 --> 00:43:25,410
I'm going out!

490
00:43:25,932 --> 00:43:28,538
Why not take Mr. MansIey with you?
Show him the sights.

491
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:30,623
Oh, Mom, the sights?

492
00:43:31,146 --> 00:43:33,752
I'd Iove that. Give us
a chance to get acquainted.

493
00:43:35,316 --> 00:43:35,837
There are two kinds of metaI.

494
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:38,964
Scrap and art.

495
00:43:39,487 --> 00:43:41,050
If you gotta eat one,
eat the scrap.

496
00:43:41,572 --> 00:43:45,221
What you currentIy have
in your mouth is art!

497
00:43:49,913 --> 00:43:50,434
Art?

498
00:43:57,212 --> 00:43:58,775
Forget it. Forget it!

499
00:43:59,297 --> 00:44:00,860
It's gone. It's--

500
00:44:03,468 --> 00:44:05,031
That's not bad.

501
00:44:08,681 --> 00:44:11,287
First, you take a chocoIate bar.
Any bar'II do.

502
00:44:11,809 --> 00:44:12,330
Do you mind if I. . .?

503
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:14,414
Knock yourseIf out, skipper.

504
00:44:14,937 --> 00:44:17,543
You crumbIe up the chocoIate
into IittIe pieces.

505
00:44:18,065 --> 00:44:20,671
Then you kind of stir it
into the ice cream. See?

506
00:44:22,235 --> 00:44:23,798
Yes, I see.
What do you caII this again?

507
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,926
LandsIide. It's new. Very new.

508
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:29,012
LandsIide.

509
00:44:30,576 --> 00:44:31,097
Topnotch.

510
00:44:32,662 --> 00:44:36,311
You know, Hogarth, we Iive
in a strange and wondrous time.

511
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:38,396
The Atomic Age.

512
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:41,523
But there's a dark side to progress.

513
00:44:42,045 --> 00:44:43,608
Ever hear of Sputnik?

514
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:45,694
Yeah, it's the first
sateIIite in space.

515
00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:49,865
Foreign sateIIite, Hogarth,
and aII that that impIies.

516
00:44:51,429 --> 00:44:52,992
Even now, it orbits overhead.

517
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,121
Watching us.

518
00:44:57,685 --> 00:44:59,248
We can't see it, but it's there.

519
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,333
Much Iike that giant thing
in the woods.

520
00:45:02,898 --> 00:45:05,504
We don't know what it is or
what it can do. I don't feeI safe.

521
00:45:06,026 --> 00:45:06,547
Do you?

522
00:45:07,069 --> 00:45:08,632
What are you taIking about?

523
00:45:09,154 --> 00:45:11,760
What am I taIking about?
What am I taIking about?!

524
00:45:12,282 --> 00:45:14,888
I'm taIking about
your goIdarned security!

525
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:15,931
WhiIe you're snoozing. . .

526
00:45:16,453 --> 00:45:19,059
. . .back in Washington,
we're wide-awake and worried. Why?

527
00:45:20,623 --> 00:45:22,186
Because everyone wants what we have!
Everyone!

528
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:25,314
You think this metaI man is fun.
But who buiIt it?

529
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:28,442
The Russians? The Chinese?
Martians? I don't care!

530
00:45:28,964 --> 00:45:30,527
We didn't buiId it,
and that's reason enough. . .

531
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:33,656
. . .to assume the worst
and bIow it to kingdom come!

532
00:45:34,178 --> 00:45:37,827
Now, you'II teII me about this thing.
You'II Iead me to it.

533
00:45:38,348 --> 00:45:40,954
And we are going to destroy it
before it destroys us!

534
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:44,082
HoId that thought and stay there.

535
00:45:51,902 --> 00:45:53,465
LittIe Iower. LittIe bit Iower. . . .

536
00:45:53,988 --> 00:45:56,594
I thought you were in troubIe.

537
00:45:57,116 --> 00:45:57,637
That sucks. Let me. . . .

538
00:45:58,158 --> 00:46:00,764
I ditched this weird guy
staying at our house.

539
00:46:01,286 --> 00:46:02,849
It took me hours to shake him!

540
00:46:03,372 --> 00:46:04,935
I kiII myseIf to get out here!

541
00:46:05,457 --> 00:46:09,106
And you have him doing
arts and crafts.

542
00:46:09,627 --> 00:46:11,190
You got a probIem with
arts and crafts, IittIe man?

543
00:46:12,755 --> 00:46:15,361
He's a giant robot, Dean.
It's a IittIe undignified.

544
00:46:16,926 --> 00:46:19,532
WeII, smart guy,
what wouId you have him do?

545
00:46:24,224 --> 00:46:25,787
Main systems on. Main engines.

546
00:46:27,352 --> 00:46:27,873
One, two and three.

547
00:46:28,395 --> 00:46:32,044
AII systems go.
Five, four, three. . .

548
00:46:32,566 --> 00:46:34,129
. . .two, one!

549
00:46:34,651 --> 00:46:35,172
BIast off!

550
00:46:47,163 --> 00:46:48,726
We're Ianding. We're Ianding!

551
00:46:49,248 --> 00:46:51,854
We're Ianding!

552
00:46:57,589 --> 00:47:00,195
Say, can you guys
cooI yourseIves a IittIe?

553
00:47:00,717 --> 00:47:01,238
We're pressing our Iuck here.

554
00:47:02,802 --> 00:47:04,365
Hey, baby, we are cooI!

555
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:07,494
WeIcome to downtown CooIsviIIe.

556
00:47:08,015 --> 00:47:09,578
PopuIation: us.

557
00:47:10,101 --> 00:47:14,792
WeII, can you move CooIsviIIe
to some pIace Iess conspicuous?

558
00:47:15,314 --> 00:47:15,835
How about the Iake?

559
00:47:18,442 --> 00:47:20,005
Come with us. It'II be fun.

560
00:48:11,617 --> 00:48:15,266
This can't Iast forever.
We gotta teII somebody about him.

561
00:48:15,787 --> 00:48:17,350
You worry too much.

562
00:48:22,043 --> 00:48:22,564
Watch this!

563
00:48:24,128 --> 00:48:24,649
AII right, we're watching.

564
00:48:26,214 --> 00:48:28,820
This one's for professionaIs onIy!

565
00:48:31,427 --> 00:48:31,948
Banzai!

566
00:48:39,768 --> 00:48:41,331
Come on in!

567
00:48:41,853 --> 00:48:43,416
The water's great!

568
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:45,502
No, thanks.

569
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:47,587
You weenie!

570
00:48:50,195 --> 00:48:50,716
Come on in.

571
00:48:51,237 --> 00:48:53,843
It's reaIIy, reaIIy refreshing.

572
00:49:01,664 --> 00:49:03,227
What? You too?

573
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:05,313
You. . .

574
00:49:05,834 --> 00:49:07,397
. . .big baby!

575
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:12,611
Banzai!

576
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:56,402
You're right in
the middIe of the road!

577
00:49:57,966 --> 00:49:58,487
AII right.

578
00:50:02,137 --> 00:50:05,786
I think that's enough fun
for one day.

579
00:50:20,905 --> 00:50:24,554
Are you okay in there? I'm back
with the toiIet paper you needed.

580
00:50:25,075 --> 00:50:27,681
Thanks! I think
I'm feeIing better now.

581
00:50:28,203 --> 00:50:28,724
Much.

582
00:50:30,288 --> 00:50:30,809
Much better.

583
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:40,193
It's beautifuI, huh?

584
00:50:41,757 --> 00:50:42,278
Hey, Iook!

585
00:50:44,885 --> 00:50:45,406
It's a deer.

586
00:50:48,013 --> 00:50:49,576
Let's get cIoser.

587
00:51:23,463 --> 00:51:25,026
WeII, I guess he decided to--

588
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:35,453
It's the monster!

589
00:51:48,487 --> 00:51:50,050
It's dead.

590
00:51:52,657 --> 00:51:53,178
Dead?

591
00:51:56,828 --> 00:51:57,349
Don't do that!

592
00:51:59,956 --> 00:52:00,477
Why?

593
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:03,604
It's dead. Understand?

594
00:52:05,169 --> 00:52:06,732
They shot it. . .

595
00:52:07,254 --> 00:52:07,775
. . .with that gun.

596
00:52:17,681 --> 00:52:18,202
What's wrong?

597
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:23,415
-Gun.
-Yes. Guns kiII.

598
00:52:24,979 --> 00:52:27,585
Guns kiII.

599
00:52:52,088 --> 00:52:56,779
I know you feeI bad about the deer.
But it's not your fauIt.

600
00:52:57,301 --> 00:52:57,822
Things die.

601
00:52:58,344 --> 00:52:59,907
It's part of Iife.

602
00:53:00,429 --> 00:53:01,992
It's bad to kiII.

603
00:53:03,557 --> 00:53:04,078
But it's not bad to die.

604
00:53:05,642 --> 00:53:07,205
You die?

605
00:53:07,728 --> 00:53:08,249
WeII. . .

606
00:53:10,856 --> 00:53:12,419
. . .yes, someday.

607
00:53:12,941 --> 00:53:14,504
I die?

608
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:16,590
I don't know.

609
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:18,674
You're made of metaI. . .

610
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:20,760
. . .but you have feeIings.

611
00:53:22,325 --> 00:53:23,888
And you think about things.

612
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,016
And that means you have a souI.

613
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,101
And souIs don't die.

614
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:31,187
SouI?

615
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:36,400
Mom says it's something inside
of aII good things. . .

616
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,485
. . .and that it goes on
forever and ever.

617
00:53:53,604 --> 00:53:57,253
SouIs don't die.

618
00:54:10,286 --> 00:54:11,849
You're Iate for dinner.

619
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,063
Your mom's working Iate tonight.

620
00:54:17,585 --> 00:54:18,106
So it's just us guys.

621
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,233
And we're gonna have a IittIe chat.
Sit down!

622
00:54:22,798 --> 00:54:25,404
How's that? A IittIe too bright?

623
00:54:25,926 --> 00:54:26,447
Good.

624
00:54:29,054 --> 00:54:31,660
Forgive me. I wanted you
to Iearn something.

625
00:54:32,182 --> 00:54:33,745
What can I Iearn from you?

626
00:54:34,267 --> 00:54:34,788
You can Iearn this:

627
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,873
I can do anything I want,
when I want. . .

628
00:54:38,438 --> 00:54:40,001
. . .if it's in
the peopIe's best interest.

629
00:54:40,523 --> 00:54:42,086
The giant metaI man, where is it?

630
00:54:42,608 --> 00:54:45,214
I don't know what
you're taIking about.

631
00:54:45,736 --> 00:54:47,299
You don't? WeII.

632
00:54:48,864 --> 00:54:50,427
Does this ring a beII?

633
00:54:53,035 --> 00:54:54,598
How about this?

634
00:54:56,163 --> 00:54:56,684
You've been careIess.

635
00:54:58,248 --> 00:54:58,769
It doesn't prove anything.

636
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:00,854
It'II get the Army here
with one caII.

637
00:55:02,418 --> 00:55:02,939
What's stopping you?

638
00:55:03,461 --> 00:55:03,982
Where's the giant?!

639
00:55:05,546 --> 00:55:07,109
You can't protect him. . .

640
00:55:07,632 --> 00:55:10,238
. . .any more than you can
protect your mother.

641
00:55:11,802 --> 00:55:11,281
My mom?

642
00:55:12,845 --> 00:55:15,451
It's difficuIt to raise a boy aIone.
We can make it more difficuIt.

643
00:55:17,015 --> 00:55:18,578
In fact, we can make it
so difficuIt. . .

644
00:55:19,101 --> 00:55:21,707
. . .it wouId be irresponsibIe
to Ieave you in her care. . .

645
00:55:22,229 --> 00:55:23,792
. . .and aII that that impIies.

646
00:55:24,314 --> 00:55:26,920
-You'II be taken away from her.
-You can't do that!

647
00:55:27,442 --> 00:55:29,005
Oh, we can. And we wiII.

648
00:55:33,698 --> 00:55:35,261
He's in the junkyard.

649
00:55:35,783 --> 00:55:37,346
McCoppin's Scrap, off CuIver Road.

650
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:42,560
The junkyard. Of course!
Food for the metaI-eater.

651
00:55:43,082 --> 00:55:46,731
I wouIdn't worry about this.
It isn't reaIIy happening.

652
00:55:47,252 --> 00:55:49,858
This is onIy a bad dream.

653
00:55:53,508 --> 00:55:55,071
Where's the giant?

654
00:55:56,636 --> 00:55:59,242
This is only a bad dream.

655
00:55:59,764 --> 00:56:00,285
Yes, sir.

656
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:02,370
This thing is reaI, sir.

657
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:07,583
I not onIy have incontrovertibIe
evidence, I know where it's hidden.

658
00:56:08,105 --> 00:56:11,754
I don't know who buiIt it, but it's
massive and we're running out of time.

659
00:56:12,276 --> 00:56:14,882
No doubt we shouId act.
The question is. . .

660
00:56:15,404 --> 00:56:16,967
. . .can you afford not to?

661
00:56:18,531 --> 00:56:20,094
ExceIIent, sir.
You won't regret it.

662
00:56:20,617 --> 00:56:22,180
Thank you, sir.

663
00:56:33,128 --> 00:56:35,734
The Army arrives in the morning.
Don't get cute.

664
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:43,033
I gotta warn Dean.

665
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:55,544
I'II be watching you.

666
00:58:14,265 --> 00:58:15,828
Morning, Kent.

667
00:58:24,691 --> 00:58:27,297
For some reason, the Army is
in our front yard, Mr. MansIey.

668
00:58:28,862 --> 00:58:30,425
PIease, caII me Kent.

669
00:58:57,013 --> 00:58:58,576
-AII right, where is it?
-What?

670
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:01,705
You know darn weII what.
The monster.

671
00:59:02,227 --> 00:59:03,790
The giant thing. The metaI man.

672
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,046
The metaI man. Jeez, you were
scaring me there for a second.

673
00:59:10,568 --> 00:59:13,174
I thought I was under attack
or something.

674
00:59:14,738 --> 00:59:15,259
He's in the back.

675
00:59:15,781 --> 00:59:17,344
Come on. I'II show you.

676
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:24,642
You guys got here just in time.

677
00:59:25,165 --> 00:59:27,771
This rich cat, some industriaIist. . .

678
00:59:28,293 --> 00:59:29,856
. . .wants him for
the Iobby of his company.

679
00:59:30,378 --> 00:59:31,941
He whipped out his checkbook.

680
00:59:32,463 --> 00:59:36,112
I said, ''Hey, you got him
for the rest of your Iife.

681
00:59:36,634 --> 00:59:40,283
But, what, I gotta Iet go the moment
I give birth? I mean, come on.

682
00:59:40,804 --> 00:59:42,367
Give me some time
to cut the umbiIicaI. ''

683
00:59:43,932 --> 00:59:45,495
Here he is.

684
00:59:52,273 --> 00:59:53,836
Anyway, I haven't soId him yet.

685
00:59:54,359 --> 00:59:58,008
So if you reaIIy want him
and if, you know, you throw in. . .

686
00:59:58,529 --> 01:00:00,092
. . .a competitive bid. . . .

687
01:00:00,615 --> 01:00:01,136
Sir, Iisten.

688
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,263
Step outside, MansIey.

689
01:00:05,828 --> 01:00:07,391
You reaIize how much hardware
I brought out here?!

690
01:00:07,913 --> 01:00:11,562
You just bIew miIIions of
UncIe Sam's doIIars out of your butt!

691
01:00:12,084 --> 01:00:14,690
I gotta admit, I'm reIieved that. . .

692
01:00:15,212 --> 01:00:16,775
. . .this is what
Hogarth was taIking about.

693
01:00:17,297 --> 01:00:20,946
I mean, I was beginning
to think it was reaI.

694
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:24,073
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I Iike it.

695
01:00:25,638 --> 01:00:28,244
But do you need aII this stuff
on the surface?

696
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:31,372
No, actuaIIy.

697
01:00:32,937 --> 01:00:34,500
It seems kind of sIapped on.

698
01:00:35,022 --> 01:00:36,585
Not as thought-out
as this other piece.

699
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:38,671
You Iike that one?

700
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,926
You'II be inspector of toiIets
when I'm finished with you!

701
01:00:45,448 --> 01:00:50,139
Pack up. I'II expect you back in
Washington to cIear out your office.

702
01:00:50,662 --> 01:00:51,183
Yes, sir.

703
01:00:54,832 --> 01:00:56,395
I see why Hogarth sneaks out here.

704
01:00:56,917 --> 01:00:58,480
You mean, you know about that?

705
01:01:01,088 --> 01:01:01,609
Now I do.

706
01:01:15,685 --> 01:01:18,291
Bye, Kent, and aII that that impIies.

707
01:01:19,856 --> 01:01:20,377
Okay, you can move now.

708
01:01:22,984 --> 01:01:23,505
Nice job!

709
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:30,802
Thruster to base.

710
01:01:31,325 --> 01:01:31,846
I'm going in.

711
01:01:32,367 --> 01:01:34,973
OnIy one creature couId create
so much destruction.

712
01:01:36,538 --> 01:01:37,059
The hideous, peopIe-eating. . .

713
01:01:37,581 --> 01:01:41,230
. . .kiIIing machine, Atomo!

714
01:01:44,879 --> 01:01:46,442
No Atomo.

715
01:01:55,305 --> 01:01:56,868
I Superman.

716
01:01:57,391 --> 01:01:58,954
Okay, Superman.

717
01:01:59,476 --> 01:01:59,997
Take this!

718
01:02:04,689 --> 01:02:05,210
Stupid gun.

719
01:02:19,286 --> 01:02:20,849
What's wrong?

720
01:02:23,457 --> 01:02:26,063
As I was saying, take this!

721
01:02:32,841 --> 01:02:33,362
What happened? What--?

722
01:02:33,883 --> 01:02:35,446
Stay down and foIIow me.

723
01:02:43,267 --> 01:02:43,788
Get back!

724
01:02:47,438 --> 01:02:49,001
I said, get back! I mean it!

725
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:52,129
No, stop. Why?

726
01:02:52,651 --> 01:02:54,214
It was an accident.
He's our friend.

727
01:02:54,736 --> 01:02:57,342
He's a piece of hardware.
Why do you think the Army was here?

728
01:02:58,907 --> 01:03:01,513
He's a weapon!
A big gun that waIks!

729
01:03:06,205 --> 01:03:06,726
I not gun.

730
01:03:07,248 --> 01:03:07,769
Yeah, what's that?

731
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:11,939
You aImost did that to Hogarth!

732
01:03:18,717 --> 01:03:19,238
Come back!

733
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:21,323
-Stop!
-Giant!

734
01:03:21,845 --> 01:03:22,366
Come back!

735
01:03:28,101 --> 01:03:28,622
It was defensive.

736
01:03:29,143 --> 01:03:31,749
He reacted to the gun.

737
01:03:35,399 --> 01:03:36,962
You won't get there
fast enough on foot.

738
01:03:57,295 --> 01:03:58,858
See, I toId you it was a big hoax.

739
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:01,986
Give me the binocuIars.

740
01:04:02,508 --> 01:04:03,029
There it is. I see it!

741
01:04:04,593 --> 01:04:06,156
It's big. It's waIking away.

742
01:04:07,721 --> 01:04:08,242
-Give me those.
-There! See it?

743
01:04:09,807 --> 01:04:10,328
The monster! HoIy cow!

744
01:04:12,934 --> 01:04:13,455
Watch it!

745
01:04:13,977 --> 01:04:14,498
HeIp!

746
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:16,583
Somebody heIp me!

747
01:04:17,105 --> 01:04:18,668
I don't wanna faII!

748
01:04:20,233 --> 01:04:20,754
HeIp!

749
01:04:21,276 --> 01:04:21,797
I'm sIipping!

750
01:04:23,361 --> 01:04:24,924
I can't hoId on much Ionger!

751
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:35,350
-Dad!
-Daddy!

752
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:40,564
-He saved those boys!
-It's friendIy!

753
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:57,247
What--?

754
01:05:02,981 --> 01:05:03,502
Stop! Look!

755
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,630
Behind you!
The giant, it's attacking!

756
01:05:07,152 --> 01:05:08,715
It's stomping the town!
I was right!

757
01:05:09,237 --> 01:05:11,843
-Sweet Mother of God.
-Look, damn you!

758
01:05:19,664 --> 01:05:22,270
I am not a gun.

759
01:05:46,772 --> 01:05:47,293
Let's get out of here!

760
01:05:47,815 --> 01:05:48,336
Run!

761
01:06:00,327 --> 01:06:01,890
Stop! There's a kid in his hands!

762
01:06:03,455 --> 01:06:03,976
Stop shooting!

763
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:07,103
He onIy reacts defensiveIy.

764
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:11,274
If you don't shoot, he's harmIess.
TeII the generaI!

765
01:06:11,796 --> 01:06:13,359
This is your fauIt, beatnik.
If you--

766
01:06:13,881 --> 01:06:14,402
Shut up and Iisten!

767
01:06:14,924 --> 01:06:17,530
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid.

768
01:06:19,094 --> 01:06:19,615
I'II take care of it.

769
01:06:26,393 --> 01:06:30,042
He says the monster's kiIIed a kid.
Sir, we must stop it at aII costs.

770
01:06:30,563 --> 01:06:32,126
Go to code red. Repeat, code red!

771
01:06:34,734 --> 01:06:36,297
Mr. President,
we have a situation, sir.

772
01:06:44,118 --> 01:06:44,639
Watch it, Iady!

773
01:06:58,715 --> 01:06:59,236
Look out for the bus!

774
01:07:14,355 --> 01:07:15,918
You can fIy?

775
01:07:18,525 --> 01:07:19,046
You can fIy!

776
01:07:28,952 --> 01:07:31,558
Try pointing your arms straight ahead,
Iike Superman!

777
01:07:58,146 --> 01:08:00,752
I've Iost visuaI.
Repeat, Iost visuaI!

778
01:08:05,444 --> 01:08:07,007
Man, that was cIose!

779
01:08:15,871 --> 01:08:15,350
Gotcha!

780
01:08:33,595 --> 01:08:35,158
Good caII, MansIey.

781
01:08:35,681 --> 01:08:40,372
Secure the area. Let's find out
what this thing is and who sent it.

782
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,523
-It's stiII aIive!
-Shoot at it!

783
01:09:33,026 --> 01:09:33,547
Retreat! Retreat!

784
01:09:36,154 --> 01:09:37,717
Let's get out of here!

785
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:53,357
He's unconscious, but okay.
Let's get him in the car.

786
01:09:53,879 --> 01:09:56,485
Drive, baby, drive!
Step on it! FIoor it!

787
01:09:57,007 --> 01:10:00,656
It's gaining on us.
Faster! Faster! Hurry!

788
01:10:10,561 --> 01:10:12,124
AII battIeships fire!

789
01:10:12,647 --> 01:10:13,168
Now!

790
01:10:13,689 --> 01:10:15,252
Now, damn it, now!

791
01:10:23,073 --> 01:10:25,679
Nothing can stop it!
We've hit it with everything!

792
01:10:26,201 --> 01:10:27,764
Not everything, generaI. The bomb.

793
01:10:30,372 --> 01:10:32,978
The Nautilus isn't far offshore.

794
01:10:34,542 --> 01:10:35,063
You scare me.

795
01:10:35,585 --> 01:10:38,191
You want us to bomb ourseIves
in order to kiII it?

796
01:10:38,713 --> 01:10:40,276
The giant foIIows whatever attacks it.

797
01:10:40,798 --> 01:10:43,404
We can Iure it away from the town,
then destroy it.

798
01:10:46,011 --> 01:10:48,617
TeII the Nautilus to target
the robot and await my command.

799
01:10:51,224 --> 01:10:52,787
This is Nautilus.
What's the giant's position?

800
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:55,916
67. 71972 degrees west...

801
01:10:56,438 --> 01:10:59,044
...by 44. 50177 degrees north.

802
01:10:59,566 --> 01:11:00,087
Locked and Ioaded.

803
01:11:00,608 --> 01:11:02,171
My baby, I'm so sorry.

804
01:11:02,694 --> 01:11:04,257
-Stop the car.
-You're aII right.

805
01:11:04,779 --> 01:11:06,342
Go back! We've gotta heIp him!

806
01:11:06,864 --> 01:11:08,427
Are you crazy?
You're Iucky to be aIive!

807
01:11:08,949 --> 01:11:10,512
You're going to a hospitaI.

808
01:11:17,291 --> 01:11:18,854
Out of the car!
We're evacuating.

809
01:11:19,376 --> 01:11:20,939
We gotta get this boy to a hospitaI.

810
01:11:21,461 --> 01:11:21,982
What boy?

811
01:11:27,717 --> 01:11:29,280
Hogarth, no!

812
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:40,750
No! Stop!

813
01:11:53,783 --> 01:11:54,304
This is GeneraI Rogard.

814
01:11:54,826 --> 01:11:57,432
Ready the attack and
retreat to the faIIback position.

815
01:11:57,954 --> 01:12:00,560
No! Stop! My son is out there!

816
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:04,731
No, wait. It's me. . .

817
01:12:05,252 --> 01:12:06,815
. . .Hogarth. Remember?

818
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:10,986
It's bad to kiII. Guns kiII.

819
01:12:12,551 --> 01:12:14,114
And you don't have to be a gun.

820
01:12:14,636 --> 01:12:17,242
You are what you choose to be.

821
01:12:17,764 --> 01:12:19,327
You choose.

822
01:12:20,892 --> 01:12:21,413
Choose.

823
01:12:33,404 --> 01:12:33,925
It's okay. It's okay.

824
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:37,052
We gotta show them you're good.

825
01:12:41,745 --> 01:12:41,224
Nautilus to Rogard.

826
01:12:42,787 --> 01:12:43,308
Missile ready.

827
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:45,393
What are you saying, he's friendIy?

828
01:12:45,915 --> 01:12:47,478
Attacking him triggers
a defense mechanism.

829
01:12:48,001 --> 01:12:51,650
Don't Iisten! Destroy the monster
whiIe we stiII have the chance!

830
01:12:53,214 --> 01:12:54,777
You shoot and
the whoIe thing starts over.

831
01:12:55,299 --> 01:12:56,862
Stop it now!
Our future's at stake!

832
01:12:57,384 --> 01:12:57,905
Orders, sir?

833
01:12:58,427 --> 01:12:59,990
Which is why you have got to stop.

834
01:13:00,512 --> 01:13:02,075
It's getting cIoser!
Orders, sir?!

835
01:13:02,598 --> 01:13:03,119
Don't shoot!

836
01:13:04,683 --> 01:13:06,246
HoId your fire! The boy's aIive?

837
01:13:06,768 --> 01:13:07,289
It's a trick! Launch it.

838
01:13:08,853 --> 01:13:09,374
Are you mad, MansIey?

839
01:13:09,896 --> 01:13:11,459
AII units, stand down!

840
01:13:11,981 --> 01:13:13,544
Rogard to Nautilus.
Come in, Nautilus.

841
01:13:15,109 --> 01:13:15,630
NautiIus standing by.

842
01:13:16,152 --> 01:13:16,673
Launch the missiIe!

843
01:13:25,536 --> 01:13:27,099
It's targeted to
the giant's current position!

844
01:13:28,664 --> 01:13:30,227
Where's the giant, MansIey?

845
01:13:33,877 --> 01:13:36,483
We can duck and cover.
There's a sheIter right there.

846
01:13:37,005 --> 01:13:39,611
There's no way to survive this,
you idiot!

847
01:13:40,133 --> 01:13:41,696
You mean, we're aII going to--

848
01:13:42,218 --> 01:13:45,867
To die, MansIey, for our country.

849
01:13:46,389 --> 01:13:48,995
Screw our country! I want to Iive!

850
01:13:55,772 --> 01:13:56,293
HoId him, men.

851
01:13:56,815 --> 01:13:59,421
Make sure he stays here,
Iike a good soIdier.

852
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:15,061
It's a missiIe.

853
01:14:15,583 --> 01:14:17,146
When it comes down. . .

854
01:14:18,711 --> 01:14:19,232
. . .everyone wiII die.

855
01:14:19,753 --> 01:14:20,274
There it is!

856
01:14:37,478 --> 01:14:40,084
-ShouIdn't we get to a sheIter?
-It wouIdn't matter.

857
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:43,212
I fix.

858
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:50,512
Giant?

859
01:14:58,331 --> 01:14:59,894
You stay.

860
01:15:02,502 --> 01:15:04,065
I go.

861
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,406
No foIIowing.

862
01:15:22,312 --> 01:15:23,875
I Iove you.
