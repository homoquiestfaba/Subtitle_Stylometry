1
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,807
The following is a dramatization of actual events

2
00:00:32,974 --> 00:00:34,722
That occurred between 2004 and 2013.

3
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:04,384
So? 
-It's the only alligator.

4
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:11,630
Four minutes past, we walk in one minute. 
He was clear on that.

5
00:01:11,798 --> 00:01:14,798
He's coming.

6
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,712
You know? 
He's too young to have that kind of access.

7
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:42,752
Ah... what time does the restaurant open. 
-Noon.

8
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:47,623
But the food's a little too spicy. This way.

9
00:01:54,957 --> 00:02:00,664
HONG KONG MONDAY JUNE 3, 2013

10
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,702
Excuse me.

11
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,242
Right here.

12
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,112
PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB

13
00:02:44,111 --> 00:02:47,694
It's uh really great to finally meet you guys.

14
00:02:47,862 --> 00:02:52,193
So first thing, can I get your cellphones please?

15
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:57,484
Thank you. We want Laura to be the only one recording.

16
00:02:57,652 --> 00:03:00,567
Right, as discussed. Thank you.

17
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:04,774
I actually bought this. It blocks UHF frequencies.

18
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:12,981
You have been photographed before, right?

19
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:16,856
Yeah, it's been a while since anybody took a photo of me.

20
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,063
Try thinking of this as your friend.

21
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:23,102
Take your time.

22
00:03:26,518 --> 00:03:30,017
Um, can you start by telling us why you did what you did?

23
00:03:30,185 --> 00:03:35,144
and uh, how you gained access to such a vast amount of information.
All of which I read on the plane, um, and...

24
00:03:35,308 --> 00:03:40,435
Glenn. How about we just start with your name?

25
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:49,181
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden.

26
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:56,303
I'm 29 years old. I work as a private 
contractor for the NSA.

27
00:03:56,471 --> 00:04:02,010
I've also worked as a private contractor for the CIA 
and directly for the agency.

28
00:04:03,722 --> 00:04:07,801
I've worked in various jobs in the intelligence industry 
for the last nine years.

29
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:11,008
I've been a systems engineer.

30
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:14,843
Uh, been a solutions consultant

31
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:19,218
and senior adviser for the Central Intelligence Agency.

32
00:04:22,966 --> 00:04:25,797
So you wanna be Special Forces? 
-Sir, yes sir!

33
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:29,924
I think Special Forces would be ashamed 
to call you soldiers!

34
00:04:30,088 --> 00:04:33,215
Am I right? Sir, no, sir.

35
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:37,131
Your left.  Your left right. Your left.

36
00:04:37,295 --> 00:04:44,129
Went from driving Cadillacs.  
Went from driving Cadillacs.

37
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:50,960
To drivin' convoys in Iraq. 
To drivin' convoys in Iraq.

38
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:53,419
Come on, soldier!

39
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:59,166
Move! Move!

40
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:04,789
Pick it up, you waste of space! Move!

41
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:09,996
Come on, soldier!

42
00:05:10,164 --> 00:05:12,039
Come on, goggles!

43
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:17,078
Snowden, what the hell are you doing? -Nothing, sir. 
Where's your fuckin' heart? - Right here, sir.

44
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:21,161
Now I want you reach way down in that pathetic excuse 
of a chest and you rip it out.

45
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:24,992
You find your heart, and then you get your broke ass on my tower! 
You got that?

46
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,036
Sir, yes, sir! 
-Now get the fuck outta my face!

47
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:32,035
I need you off my tower, gentlemen! Let's move!

48
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:37,282
Move! Come on!

49
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:43,780
Rise and shine maggots! Get your hands off your dicks and 
get the fuck out of my barracks!

50
00:05:43,948 --> 00:05:48,240
You guys got one minute! Fall out! Move, move, move!

51
00:06:00,237 --> 00:06:02,405
Fuck!

52
00:06:03,612 --> 00:06:06,236
Help!

53
00:06:06,404 --> 00:06:10,651
Snowden? Where the fuck is Snowden? 
-Help!

54
00:06:12,194 --> 00:06:17,233
You know, you've been walkin' around on two broken legs, 
best I can tell, for weeks.

55
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:24,316
Now, this is what happens when you put a 80 pound rucksack 
on a 150 pound body.

56
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,063
You get these little stress fractures. 
-Easy. -Sorry.

57
00:06:28,231 --> 00:06:32,606
They build up in your tibias. You don't get off of them 
and eventually they just bust.

58
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:39,397
Now you gonna be here for a few weeks, and then, 
I'd count on another eight weeks or so on crutches.

59
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:41,768
Okay, then when do I go back?

60
00:06:41,936 --> 00:06:47,311
Son, you ever again land on those legs of yours,
airborne or not, those bones turn to powder.

61
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:52,310
I'm gonna authorize an administrative discharge.

62
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,473
Plenty of other ways to serve your country.

63
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:05,391
GEEK-MATE.COM NEW MESSAGE

64
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,598
"Ghost in the Shell" is also one of my favorites.

65
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:15,637
Are you this pale in real life?

66
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:21,928
Have you committed a crime for which you weren't caught?

67
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:23,927
No.

68
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,258
Have you cheated on an exam?

69
00:07:29,426 --> 00:07:31,258
No.

70
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:36,756
Do you believe the United States is the greatest country in the world? 
-Yes.

71
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:40,424
Why do you want to join the CIA?

72
00:07:40,592 --> 00:07:44,215
How would you explain the Internet to a child?

73
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:48,506
Your grandad retired as an admiral and joined the FBI.

74
00:07:48,674 --> 00:07:51,129
Dad's in the Coast Guard.  30-year man.

75
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:54,213
What has been the most important day in your life?

76
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:58,420
9/11. We thought my grandfather was inside the Pentagon.

77
00:07:58,588 --> 00:08:01,419
It turned out he was offsite that day.

78
00:08:01,587 --> 00:08:07,042
You wanted to be Special Forces? 
-Yes, sir. I love their motto.

79
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:10,833
De oppresso liber. 
-Is that what you hope to do with us?

80
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:13,293
Free people from oppression?

81
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:16,748
I'd like to help my country make a difference in the world.

82
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:20,499
The Internet is a technology

83
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:25,330
that has the power to let everyone in 
the world understand each other.

84
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:30,581
Missed a perfect score on the ASVAB test by a single question.

85
00:08:30,745 --> 00:08:33,996
Crushed the language learning test.

86
00:08:34,164 --> 00:08:37,536
Some Mandarin, some Japanese.

87
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:43,410
And no high school diploma? 
So why did you stop attending high school?

88
00:08:43,578 --> 00:08:48,701
I had to make money. 
My parents were divorcing at the time.

89
00:08:48,869 --> 00:08:52,700
Any other influences? I'd say Joseph Campbell.

90
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,031
Star Wars. Thoreau.

91
00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:03,074
Ayn Rand. 
-"One man can stop the motor of the world."

92
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:06,445
Atlas Shrugged? Yes, sir. I believe that.

93
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:11,572
Let's try again. Why do you want to join the CIA?

94
00:09:15,236 --> 00:09:17,819
Uh, well frankly, sir...

95
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:24,526
sounds really cool to have top security clearance.

96
00:09:32,276 --> 00:09:33,860
It's not enough.

97
00:09:40,858 --> 00:09:45,149
Ordinarily. But these are not ordinary times.

98
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:52,148
Bombs won't stop terrorism, brains will, 
though we don't have nearly enough of those.

99
00:09:52,312 --> 00:09:57,978
I'm gonna give you a shot, Snowden.
Thank your, sir.  Thank you very much.  
You won't regret this.

100
00:09:58,146 --> 00:10:03,353
My name is Corbin O'Brien. I have many titles, 
among them senior instructor.

101
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:06,769
You'll be joining my class at The Hill.

102
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:10,352
Stop the vehicle. Turn off the engine.

103
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:14,143
I need to see your ID.

104
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,390
Alright. Using your left hand only, pop the trunk.

105
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:27,848
Now place your hands through the steering wheel on the dashboard.

106
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:31,927
Through the steering wheel on the dashboard. 
Do not exit the vehicle.

107
00:10:42,469 --> 00:10:46,300
CIA TRAINING CENTER, VIRGINIA "THE HILL" 
- 2006

108
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:54,590
Excuse me.
You'll be looking for Corbin's class; end of the hall,
keep going through the second set of doors.

109
00:10:54,758 --> 00:11:01,049
Thank you. Is that, uh, ENIGMA? No. ENIGMA was broken.

110
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:04,840
This is the follow-up, SIGABA; never broken.

111
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:07,504
Cold War's greatest encryption machine.

112
00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:11,711
Tides of history tick with this motor and these rotors.

113
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,002
One day everyone's gonna want a machine like this.

114
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,585
Wow, I've always wanted to learn cryptography. 
What's this one?

115
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:23,876
Hot line. First line between Washington and Moscow.

116
00:11:24,044 --> 00:11:27,707
Probably prevented World War III.

117
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:31,207
You gotta name? How do I know you're not the enemy?

118
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:34,626
Oh sorry, uh Snowden. Ed Snowden. 
-Hank Forrester.

119
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,997
Where'd you study, Snowden? Mostly I'm self-taught.

120
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:42,080
You can tell me if you're busy, but is that a Cray-1?

121
00:11:42,248 --> 00:11:48,995
Why yes. Yes, it is. The first supercomputer.

122
00:11:49,163 --> 00:11:53,162
We get all of this on a cell phone now. 
-Yes. So you're an engineer?

123
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,037
Am I an engineer? Instructor and counselor, too.

124
00:11:57,201 --> 00:11:59,329
I'm supposed to keep an eye on you CTs.

125
00:11:59,493 --> 00:12:03,408
Make sure you don't buckle under the pressure. 
Turn to drugs and booze.

126
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:06,907
Well, you won't have that problem with me. 
I don't drink or do drugs.

127
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:11,906
What is your sin of choice? 
-Computers.

128
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:16,905
Well then, Snowden. You've some to the whorehouse.

129
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:24,863
The front lines in the global war on terror 
are not Iraq or Afghanistan.

130
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:27,195
They're here.

131
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:30,614
In London. Berlin.

132
00:12:32,114 --> 00:12:34,029
Istanbul.

133
00:12:34,193 --> 00:12:37,069
Any server. Any connection.

134
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:41,320
The modern battlefield is everywhere.

135
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:49,858
Which means you don't have to sit in a ditch eating MREs 
or dodging mortar fire.

136
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:53,897
It means that if there is a another 9/11

137
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:57,856
it'll be your fault.

138
00:12:58,024 --> 00:13:02,439
Just as the last one was my generation's.

139
00:13:02,607 --> 00:13:06,394
Believe me, you do not want to live with that burden.

140
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:14,893
We're gonna start with an aptitude test.

141
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:18,976
Each of you is gonna build a covert communications 
network in your home city.

142
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:27,682
You're gonna deploy it, back up your site, 
destroy it and restore it again.

143
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,601
Point of this exercise is to keep your 
infrastructure up and running securely.

144
00:13:32,765 --> 00:13:39,555
The average test time is five hours. 
If you take more than eight, you will fail.

145
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,050
Mr. O'Brien?

146
00:14:07,218 --> 00:14:09,049
I'm done, sir.

147
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:11,841
You don't have to tell me when you've completed a stage.

148
00:14:12,008 --> 00:14:16,216
No, I finished the whole thing. 
-It's been 40 minutes.

149
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:19,131
38. 
-What?

150
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:22,006
38 minutes.

151
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,797
Okay. Let's see where you screwed up.

152
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:50,708
You didn't say we had to do it in order, so I ...

153
00:14:50,872 --> 00:14:57,163
I broke the sequence to save time, and I made the backup 
process to run as I built the site.

154
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,246
Eyes on screens.

155
00:15:06,829 --> 00:15:09,704
Mr. O'Brien?

156
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:14,827
So, what should I do now? 
-Whatever you want.

157
00:15:28,234 --> 00:15:30,150
Are you this pale in real life?

158
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:53,774
Hey. 
-Hi.

159
00:15:55,274 --> 00:15:58,026
Finally. 
-Yeah.

160
00:16:01,526 --> 00:16:03,858
Sorry.

161
00:16:07,194 --> 00:16:12,150
Do you want ... anything? 
-No. Let's go for a walk.

162
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:18,858
You could use some sun. 
-Yeah. You mentioned that earlier.

163
00:16:20,066 --> 00:16:25,066
Sorry it took me this long. 
You didn't want to see me on crutches.

164
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,818
I was not so agile. And then this new job hit.

165
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:33,442
What was it you're doing again? 
-I'm doing analysis for the State Department.

166
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,274
Congratulations. 
-Thanks.

167
00:16:36,442 --> 00:16:41,610
Could you do me a favor and point in the 
direction of the State Department?

168
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:50,818
Yeah, it's that way. 
-Where? Are you sure?

169
00:16:50,982 --> 00:16:56,526
I mean, I'm not that great at orienting myself. 
-Not that great at lying either.

170
00:16:56,694 --> 00:17:00,858
You're going to have to work on both if you wanna be a spy.

171
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:04,442
Where I came from everyone's parent worked for the State Department.

172
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,066
Plus, every time you visited my website this week,

173
00:17:08,234 --> 00:17:11,650
which was quite often, it was from an IP in Virginia.

174
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:14,402
You know how to run an IP trace? 
-Yeah.

175
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:18,982
I'm pretty sure that the State Department has no offices in Virginia.

176
00:17:27,566 --> 00:17:30,234
Alright, let's see you strut it. 
-Let's see what?

177
00:17:30,402 --> 00:17:33,442
Let's see you strut it. Show what you got, 
you know, your best catwalk.

178
00:17:35,026 --> 00:17:38,694
Don't be shy. Come on, you got this.

179
00:17:43,358 --> 00:17:45,526
I don't know ...

180
00:17:50,566 --> 00:17:55,942
No to Bush, no to bombs. No to Bush, no to bombs.

181
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:59,694
Would you mind signing our petition, please? 
-Yes, absolutely.

182
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:04,110
Thank you 
-Thank you so much.

183
00:18:04,274 --> 00:18:06,194
Sir? 
-No thank you.

184
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:11,694
Excuse me ma'am, you you like to sign? 
-I actually just signed. 
-Okay, thank you very much.

185
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,982
Too much independent spirit for you?

186
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,858
No, I just don't really like bashing my country.

187
00:18:20,026 --> 00:18:24,358
It's my country too, and right now it has blood on its hands.

188
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,942
Sorry, I just have friends who are over there right now.

189
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:33,774
I'm not talking about the troops, 
I'm talking about the moron sending them to war.

190
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:37,650
You mean our commander in chief? 
-Yeah. Whatever you wanna call him, he's still wrong.

191
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:40,482
How do you know he's wrong? You're just lashing out.

192
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,318
No, I'm not lashing out.  
I'm questioning our government.

193
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:46,734
That's what we do in this country.  T
hat's the principle that we're founded on.

194
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:51,526
Okay, but how about questioning the liberal media?

195
00:18:51,694 --> 00:18:55,858
You're just buying into what one side is saying.

196
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:59,442
Maybe I am. Because my side is right.

197
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,818
See that's funny, because my side is right. 
-Oh really? -Yeah.

198
00:19:04,482 --> 00:19:08,150
Why is it smart conservatives always make me so mad?

199
00:19:08,318 --> 00:19:10,982
Probably because you don't like hearing the truth.

200
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,982
You're a very frustrating individual. You know that?

201
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:22,150
How am I gonna make you see 
-I can see just fine, thank you.

202
00:19:28,694 --> 00:19:31,066
That help at all?

203
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:36,194
Nope, that did nothing for me. Tastes like liberal.

204
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:39,234
Not my thing.

205
00:19:40,734 --> 00:19:45,110
"Bush lets U.S. spy on callers without courts."

206
00:19:45,274 --> 00:19:48,902
Is it Constitutional to bypass the courts?

207
00:19:49,066 --> 00:19:53,358
No. The fourth amendment prevents searches 
and seizures without a warrant.

208
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,566
That's absolutely right, Rio. Which means,

209
00:19:56,734 --> 00:20:01,858
your commander in chief, the President of 
the United States is breaking the law.

210
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:06,026
That is what you're saying, isn't that, Rio?

211
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:10,234
Well, I guess it depends on ... who you talk to.

212
00:20:10,402 --> 00:20:13,110
And if you talk to journalists?

213
00:20:13,274 --> 00:20:18,274
Who, more often than not, don't have the full picture 
or neglect to report it.

214
00:20:18,442 --> 00:20:21,194
You've only got a partial truth.

215
00:20:23,982 --> 00:20:28,234
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
The FISA court.

216
00:20:28,402 --> 00:20:32,026
We do respect the fourth amendment in this country.

217
00:20:32,194 --> 00:20:34,982
We issue warrants based on suspicion.

218
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,982
But sometimes these warrants have to be issued by secret courts.

219
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,982
So we don't alert the suspect we're spying on.

220
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,818
And these court proceedings are classified, 
which means, surprise...

221
00:20:46,982 --> 00:20:51,442
They don't appear in papers such as the New York Times.

222
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,858
Did you see my test scores? 
-Yes. Top of my class, like you.

223
00:20:57,026 --> 00:20:58,942
Here? 
-NSA.

224
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,358
They liked me plenty. 
They put me on all the best teams.

225
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:07,234
Soviet Frontier. Desert Storm. 
And then the big new challenge.

226
00:21:07,402 --> 00:21:11,858
Find the terrorists in the Internet haystack. 
Helluva haystack.

227
00:21:12,026 --> 00:21:16,482
Hundreds of terabytes a minute. I mean, 
it would take you 400 years to read the e-mails.

228
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:21,442
And then you have to analyze them. 
Sometimes the more you look, the less you see.

229
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:25,566
What'd you come up with? 
-Something beautiful. In house...

230
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:29,358
for three million dollars. A program that 
could differentiate between foreign

231
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:31,358
and domestic...

232
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:34,982
Encrypt every single we weren't targeting, 
so that it would remain private.

233
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:40,150
It was elegant, streamlined. 
It was the best work I ever did.

234
00:21:40,318 --> 00:21:43,442
Take a seat.

235
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,774
What was it called?

236
00:21:52,318 --> 00:21:57,650
Ed, rising to the top in our world

237
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:01,274
can sometimes be hard on a man.

238
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:05,650
I mean, you think you're making strides.

239
00:22:05,818 --> 00:22:09,194
You think you're taking the initiative.

240
00:22:09,358 --> 00:22:12,110
And then the next minute, they grind your work out of existence.

241
00:22:12,274 --> 00:22:17,234
They didn't use it? Why not? 
-Well, they never tell you why.

242
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:21,358
Two years later, after 9/11,

243
00:22:21,526 --> 00:22:25,566
a friend of mine tells me about this new contractor 
program they're using.

244
00:22:25,734 --> 00:22:30,402
Cost four billion dollars to deploy; modeled after mine.

245
00:22:30,566 --> 00:22:34,066
But with no filters, no automation.

246
00:22:34,234 --> 00:22:39,358
Ingested everything. They were drowning in data. 
It was a fucking disaster.

247
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:43,318
But there must have been some bigger picture, right?  
I mean,

248
00:22:43,482 --> 00:22:45,858
spending that kind of money. They're not stupid.

249
00:22:46,026 --> 00:22:50,818
You would think intelligence would count 
for something in the intelligence business.

250
00:22:50,982 --> 00:22:55,650
But you want to know what it really is?  
What really sets the agenda?

251
00:22:56,982 --> 00:23:02,358
Military industrial happiness management.

252
00:23:02,526 --> 00:23:07,902
You keep the coffers open in Congress, 
you keep the money flowing to the contractors.

253
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:11,818
Efficiency, results, they go out the window.

254
00:23:11,982 --> 00:23:15,694
Not to mention ...

255
00:23:16,858 --> 00:23:21,110
Well, you're late for class. 
-Okay, thank you.

256
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:26,026
Oh, can I take another one? 
-Sure.

257
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:34,942
Did you ever say anything to anybody?

258
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:39,274
Yeah, I went to legal. We filed complaints.

259
00:23:39,442 --> 00:23:43,902
Now here I am, tucked away, teaching you.

260
00:23:46,026 --> 00:23:50,150
Maybe that's more important in the long run. 
You're getting better.

261
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,274
My favorite spot on campus.

262
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:12,902
Do you hunt, Ed?

263
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:19,902
Uh, just some skeet shooting with my dad a few times, 
but I never went hunting.

264
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:23,610
We'll go one day. 
-That'd be great.

265
00:24:23,774 --> 00:24:27,274
Mr. O'Brien, can I ask you a question? 
-How about just calling me Corbin?

266
00:24:27,442 --> 00:24:31,650
Okay. Thank you, sir. Corbin.

267
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:36,274
I was talking with Hank Forrester, and I wanted to know

268
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:41,482
are all of our SIGINT programs specifically targeted?

269
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:45,442
Of course. What good would they be if they weren't?

270
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:49,150
Yeah, I don't know.

271
00:24:50,526 --> 00:24:55,982
Do you have a girlfriend, Ed? 
-Uh, nothing serious.

272
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:59,110
What's her name? 
-Lindsay.

273
00:24:59,274 --> 00:25:01,858
She going with you?

274
00:25:02,026 --> 00:25:05,234
No, I wouldn't want to put her in any danger.

275
00:25:05,402 --> 00:25:09,110
Well, you don't have to. We're not sending you 
to the Middle East.

276
00:25:13,318 --> 00:25:18,566
Sir, I'm your best student. 
Doesn't that count for something?

277
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:23,774
In 20 years, Iraq'll be a hellhole nobody cares about.

278
00:25:23,942 --> 00:25:26,066
Terrorism's a short-term threat.

279
00:25:26,234 --> 00:25:30,358
The real threats will come from China, Russia, Iran.

280
00:25:30,526 --> 00:25:33,442
And they'll come as SQL injections and malware.

281
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:38,066
Without minds like yours, this country will be 
torn apart in cyberspace.

282
00:25:38,234 --> 00:25:43,150
I don't wanna risk losing you for some 
horse shit war over sand and oil.

283
00:25:45,234 --> 00:25:47,194
Sir, I'm surprised to hear you say that.

284
00:25:47,358 --> 00:25:52,150
You don't have to agree with your 
politicians to be a patriot.

285
00:25:55,026 --> 00:25:59,442
Sir, where are you sending me? 
-Take a moment. Enjoy the view.

286
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:11,442
HONG KONG TUESDAY, June 4, 2013

287
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,858
This is Laura.

288
00:26:23,026 --> 00:26:26,902
Hello. 
-Hello, nice to meet you.

289
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:30,358
Ewen MacAskill from the Guardian. It's nice to meet you. 
-Nice to meet you, too.

290
00:26:30,526 --> 00:26:33,610
Um, if you don't mind, I'd like to record some... 
-Ah.

291
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,110
Cell phones go in the microwave. 
-Dare I ask why?

292
00:26:38,274 --> 00:26:41,734
We'll get to that after you ask your questions.

293
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:44,982
Before we get on to the story, I need to know more about you.

294
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:51,234
Like, your career, by a glance account, 
is very varied, but the Guardian needs evidence ...

295
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:54,650
Yeah, this is my diplomatic passport for friendly countries.

296
00:26:54,818 --> 00:26:58,194
My tourist passports for everywhere else. 
You can check the visa stamps.

297
00:26:58,358 --> 00:27:01,774
My NSA badge with Booz Allen. 
My CIA badge with Dell.

298
00:27:01,942 --> 00:27:05,442
And this is my DIA instructor's badge.

299
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:08,610
This is a photo of me with Michael Hayden,

300
00:27:08,774 --> 00:27:12,026
the former head of the NSA and the CIA.

301
00:27:12,194 --> 00:27:14,734
When can you publish?

302
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:17,694
K, um, do you mind if I sit down? 
-No, please.

303
00:27:20,026 --> 00:27:26,150
Glenn says, you want to tell people your identity.
How do you think your governmentÕs going to react?

304
00:27:26,318 --> 00:27:28,982
Well, they'll charge me under the espionage act.

305
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,274
And they'll say I endangered national security.

306
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,402
They'll demonize me, and my friends and family.

307
00:27:35,566 --> 00:27:39,358
And they'll throw me in jail. 
That's the best case scenario.

308
00:27:39,526 --> 00:27:41,150
And the worst?

309
00:27:41,318 --> 00:27:45,694
Well, if I don't have any media cover, then 
I'll be rendered by the CIA

310
00:27:45,858 --> 00:27:48,902
and interrogated outside of the law.

311
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:53,818
They have a station right up the street.
-But how would they know what you did?

312
00:27:53,982 --> 00:27:57,150
Because I left a digital footprint in my logs. 
So they'll figure it out.

313
00:27:57,318 --> 00:28:01,566
I did not want a manhunt. I know what they would do to my colleagues.

314
00:28:02,734 --> 00:28:09,194
Look, Mr. MacAskill, this is not about money or anything for me.

315
00:28:09,358 --> 00:28:12,026
There's no hidden agenda. I just wanted to get this data

316
00:28:12,194 --> 00:28:14,610
to established journalists like yourselves

317
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:18,566
so that you can present it to the world, and the people can decide.

318
00:28:18,734 --> 00:28:21,150
Either I'm wrong

319
00:28:21,318 --> 00:28:25,858
or there's something going on inside the government, 
that's really wrong.

320
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:31,818
So...

321
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:38,066
This one is everything I have on your British Intelligence 
agency, the GCHQ.

322
00:28:38,234 --> 00:28:40,942
The encryption key will follow.

323
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:46,734
You're gonna want your technical people at the Guardian to look
through that thoroughly. There's a lot of stuff there.

324
00:28:50,402 --> 00:28:54,734
Listen, they're gonna investigate, 
and they're gonna figure out what I've done.

325
00:28:54,902 --> 00:28:58,610
And then they're gonna come for me. 
And now that we've made contact,

326
00:29:00,482 --> 00:29:03,610
they're gonna come for all of you, too.

327
00:29:10,526 --> 00:29:13,026
Do you mind if I go look in the microwave?

328
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:22,318
THE GUARDIAN U.S.
NEW YORK OFFICE

329
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:26,650
Ewen, I'm on with Stuart. 
-How are you, Ewen?

330
00:29:26,818 --> 00:29:33,194
Hi, Stuart. Look I've got one thing to say. 
The Guinness here is great.

331
00:29:33,358 --> 00:29:36,650
Wonderful. -Absolutely the genuine article. 
-Good.

332
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:38,982
But shockingly different from what you expect.

333
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:44,902
So, now we have the lawyers to deal with and no doubt the White House.

334
00:29:46,274 --> 00:29:48,982
I got the go ahead. 
-That's great.

335
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:54,026
Good, let's get started. We have a lot to go through here and it's not easy reading.
-We can start by showing him XKeyscore.

336
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:57,818
Good idea. Can you bring it up again and walk us through it? 
-Yeah.

337
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:09,318
Do we all get under there now? 
-He's protecting his passwords.

338
00:30:09,482 --> 00:30:12,026
Okay, so...

339
00:30:15,942 --> 00:30:21,942
This was introduced during my first 
deployment at the CIA in Geneva.

340
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,774
XKeyscore. What does that do?

341
00:30:26,942 --> 00:30:30,194
It's like a search interface.

342
00:30:31,774 --> 00:30:35,150
What does it search for? 
-Anything you want.

343
00:30:36,982 --> 00:30:39,694
What was your assignment in Geneva?

344
00:30:39,858 --> 00:30:43,650
Well, I was assigned with diplomatic cover to the U.N. mission to

345
00:30:43,818 --> 00:30:47,818
maintain the CIA's computer security network.

346
00:30:49,902 --> 00:30:54,526
I spent almost two years around CIA field officers.

347
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,818
I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.

348
00:31:04,982 --> 00:31:09,234
Sherman says you hacked the Human Resources site.
-Yeah, it's my job to find flaws.

349
00:31:09,402 --> 00:31:14,066
The security of the HR site is not your problem.
You went outside the wheelhouse.

350
00:31:14,234 --> 00:31:17,194
Okay, but just to clarify, I did not hack.

351
00:31:17,358 --> 00:31:20,194
I showed that it could be hacked. 
You told me to find a patch.

352
00:31:20,358 --> 00:31:22,358
Do you have that in writing? 
-Yes, I do.

353
00:31:22,526 --> 00:31:25,274
Remember, I sent you the proof of concept.

354
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:31,694
Doesn't matter what you did, Snowden, right or wrong,
you need to let these things be someone else's problem.

355
00:31:31,858 --> 00:31:35,066
He's also put a derog in your file. 
-Excuse me?

356
00:31:35,234 --> 00:31:40,358
Let that be a lesson.  I don't want him calling me again 
about another Ed Snowden moment. Okay?

357
00:31:44,274 --> 00:31:49,194
Why don't you take it easy the rest of the day. 
Go work on the scrubbing pile?

358
00:31:54,358 --> 00:31:57,110
That didn't look like it went well. 
-Uh hey man, uh yeah

359
00:31:57,274 --> 00:32:00,734
No, I just got a derog for doing my job.

360
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:04,650
Politics, man. Culture of fear wins again.

361
00:32:04,818 --> 00:32:06,942
I can't get anything done here.

362
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:11,526
Hey um, what about that idea that we've been talking about? 
-I'm workin' on it.

363
00:32:11,694 --> 00:32:14,442
I'm waiting for a callback from our friend at The Hill.

364
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:17,566
Corbin? You called Corbin? 
Do you think he could do something?

365
00:32:17,734 --> 00:32:20,694
We'll see.  Maybe some limited field ops 
under my supervision.

366
00:32:20,858 --> 00:32:23,818
Yes, that would be amazing, I would love... 
-Easy, Ed.

367
00:32:23,982 --> 00:32:28,234
I've gotta see a cleric in Milan. We'll talk after. 
-Okay. Thank you.

368
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:49,942
Damn, CIA does not like to leave a trace, huh? 
-Can I help you?

369
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,358
Ever been curious to check one out?

370
00:32:52,526 --> 00:32:55,610
See what crazy ass covert kill mission 
you might be erasing from history?

371
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:58,526
I'm sorry, who are you with? 
-No Such Agency.

372
00:32:58,694 --> 00:33:03,650
I'm Gabriel Sol. 
I'm the 50 pound brain from the council of wizards and warlocks.

373
00:33:03,818 --> 00:33:06,858
Excuse me? 
-Give me your intel for Bucharest, dude.

374
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,566
Oh. Unless there's another Dave Churchyard.

375
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:12,194
No, that's me. Right this way.

376
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:18,526
I'll be right outside. 
-You stay if you want.

377
00:33:18,694 --> 00:33:22,774
Uh no, I don't have authorization to use NSA programs.

378
00:33:22,942 --> 00:33:28,734
If you're the messenger to Bucharest, you must have PRIVAC 
clearance to see the finished intel, yes? 
-Yeah.

379
00:33:28,902 --> 00:33:32,402
So what difference does it make 
if you see how it's put together.

380
00:33:34,566 --> 00:33:36,482
It's up to you, man.

381
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,902
You're giving me just names? 
-Aye, a lot more than names.

382
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:48,318
What I will be providing you and the fine 
gentlemen of the Secret Service,

383
00:33:48,482 --> 00:33:52,858
is a list of every threat about the president 
since February 3rd.

384
00:33:53,026 --> 00:33:56,858
And a profile of every threat maker.

385
00:33:57,026 --> 00:34:00,650
And these are, like, existing targets?

386
00:34:00,818 --> 00:34:04,234
99% are gonna come from the bulk collection program, so...

387
00:34:04,402 --> 00:34:08,358
Upstream, Muscular, Tempora, PRISM.
PRISM?

388
00:34:10,026 --> 00:34:12,694
You got a little Snow White in you.

389
00:34:12,858 --> 00:34:17,526
Almost makes me feel like the witch bringing you a poison apple.

390
00:34:17,694 --> 00:34:21,734
Exhibit A: Oakland resident Justin Pinsky posted on a message board:

391
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:24,610
"Romania has a storied history of executing their leaders,

392
00:34:24,774 --> 00:34:28,402
couldn't they do us a solid and take out Bush?"

393
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,358
Oh, this looks juicy. It's from a Gchat.

394
00:34:31,526 --> 00:34:33,526
[I'm going to attack your bush...]

395
00:34:33,694 --> 00:34:38,234
"... With the biggest python, you've ever seen."

396
00:34:38,402 --> 00:34:40,774
How is this all possible?

397
00:34:40,942 --> 00:34:45,482
Um, keyword selectors. "attack", "take out bush".

398
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:48,902
So think of it as a Google search, except instead of searching

399
00:34:49,066 --> 00:34:52,194
only what people make public, 
we're also looking at everything they don't, so

400
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:57,610
E-mail, chats, SMS. Whatever. 
-Yes, but which people?

401
00:34:57,774 --> 00:35:00,026
The whole kingdom, Snow White.

402
00:35:06,696 --> 00:35:11,320
Which ambassador is he again?
-De la Hoya, the World Trade Organization.

403
00:35:26,944 --> 00:35:29,652
So, O'Brien came through for ya.

404
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,904
He agrees your talents are being wasted. 
You ready for a little action?

405
00:35:34,072 --> 00:35:38,280
Really? You mean right here? 
-Yeah.

406
00:35:38,444 --> 00:35:41,196
You see the woman in the pink number?

407
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,196
Credit Suisse. JP Morgan's on her arm.

408
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,820
Grandma's with Deutsche Bank. 
10,000 bankers in this town...

409
00:35:47,988 --> 00:35:49,860
all you need to turn is one.

410
00:35:50,028 --> 00:35:53,612
Socialize. Meet a few. Preferably one sitting on a

411
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:59,236
pile of dirty Saudi money that's funding Bin Laden.

412
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:04,112
Churchyard. 
-This man is either a fool or a spy.

413
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:10,112
Mr. Nembrini? asks you, business card please.

414
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,944
An ambassador. Wow.  I wish I had your schmoozing skills.

415
00:36:15,112 --> 00:36:19,280
That's why you have me. 
-Don't know any banker, do you?

416
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:22,652
Bankers? Are you on some kind of assignment or something?

417
00:36:24,612 --> 00:36:30,072
I'm relationship cultivating, and not well.

418
00:36:30,236 --> 00:36:34,280
Let me help. 
-No, this is serious.

419
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:36,736
I know it's serious. Trust me.

420
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:42,612
Any luck? 
-No. No bites.

421
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,528
Is there some kinda trick to it?

422
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:48,696
It's all about finding the pressure point.

423
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,488
Everything else is just pushin' em.

424
00:36:53,488 --> 00:36:56,112
Looks like you're being summoned.

425
00:37:00,196 --> 00:37:03,696
Marwan, may I interrupt? This is my boyfriend Dave.

426
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,196
Hello, Dave. Nice to meet you. 
-Nice to meet you.

427
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,072
Marwan works at Monfort. We were talking

428
00:37:09,236 --> 00:37:13,320
and after last week he may be able to give you some tips.

429
00:37:13,488 --> 00:37:16,572
Gentlemen, I'll see you inside 
-Last week?

430
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:20,444
He's embarrassed. 
It was a lot of money for us.

431
00:37:22,652 --> 00:37:27,196
Day trading is a perilous sport.
You shouldn't be ashamed of it.

432
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,780
Yeah.  I'm gonna grab some food.  
See you guys inside?

433
00:37:30,944 --> 00:37:32,904
Sure.

434
00:37:33,072 --> 00:37:35,944
You have a lovely girlfriend. 
-Thank you so much.

435
00:37:36,112 --> 00:37:40,404
You know I work in IT, and so I just figured I could crack the market

436
00:37:40,572 --> 00:37:42,404
like a weak network.

437
00:37:42,572 --> 00:37:46,028
May I ask how precipitous were your losses?

438
00:37:46,196 --> 00:37:50,404
Well, I told Lindsay it was 20,000, but between you and me

439
00:37:50,572 --> 00:37:55,112
it was closer to 45. I tried to recoup, but

440
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,572
that was a mistake, and now without any real grounding,
I feel like I'm just sliding out of control.

441
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:05,904
I've seen it many times and I'm always happy to help
a man break a bad habit before it gets going.

442
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:08,280
Well, thank you, I really appreciate it.

443
00:38:09,404 --> 00:38:12,780
It's the cleanest Pakistani I've ever seen.

444
00:38:12,944 --> 00:38:17,820
You got no first degree ties to government or ISI.  No shady family.

445
00:38:17,988 --> 00:38:22,280
Second degree contacts are off the charts, 
but that's everyone in the Middle East with a six-figure income.

446
00:38:22,444 --> 00:38:26,404
It's not dirt that we need necessarily. 
It's a pressure point.

447
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:31,696
Something intimate. Some kind of weakness. 
Can we look through his family?

448
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:37,280
How about his sister-in-law?

449
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:46,612
What is that? Is that some video that she sent somebody? 
-No, this is live.

450
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,820
Out of Paris. 
-What do you mean "live"?

451
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:52,944
Optic Nerve. It's camera and mic activation.

452
00:38:53,112 --> 00:38:55,196
I wish we could take credit, but the Brits wrote it.

453
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,320
Activation? -Yeah, her laptop's off.

454
00:39:00,488 --> 00:39:04,696
Or was. She just forgot to close it.  Of course, how would she now?
The shit is so sly the webcam light doesn't even turn on.

455
00:39:12,572 --> 00:39:16,736
I've always wondered what was under those.

456
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:26,028
Let's stick to family in Geneva. Alright?

457
00:39:26,196 --> 00:39:29,152
Okay, Snow White.

458
00:39:30,028 --> 00:39:33,528
Uh 15-year-old daughter at the International School.

459
00:39:33,696 --> 00:39:37,988
Facebook? Is that possible? 
-Dude, Facebook is my bitch.

460
00:39:38,152 --> 00:39:42,488
Seriously?  If she fights with her parents...

461
00:39:42,652 --> 00:39:46,112
Don't worry. I know all the hooks for this kinda fishing.

462
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:50,612
Query name? E-mail, keyword, whatever selectee we want.

463
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,988
And justification is where I write.

464
00:39:57,028 --> 00:40:00,280
In other words, turning her daddy into a CIA informant.

465
00:40:00,444 --> 00:40:02,572
That's it? -That's it, bro.

466
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:06,280
You don't have to get a FISA court order?

467
00:40:06,444 --> 00:40:10,780
No, not here. XKeyscore's under 702 authority, 
which means no warrants.

468
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:14,652
Okay, but U.S. targets, then you'd have to get the court order?

469
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,236
You mean FISA? Yeah, that's just a big-ass rubber stamp, dude.

470
00:40:18,404 --> 00:40:21,572
I mean, FISA judges are all appointed by 
the chief justice, who's like, you know...

471
00:40:23,904 --> 00:40:28,028
Darth Vader when it comes to national security. Boom.

472
00:40:31,612 --> 00:40:36,988
And the boy, third base, is...

473
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,780
... Nadim. Okay.

474
00:40:42,488 --> 00:40:47,652
He's 18. Salmasays she wants to marry him.  
But she's scared of her parents.

475
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:52,236
And what she does not know is that his other name is...

476
00:40:52,404 --> 00:40:54,572
Nicolas.

477
00:40:54,736 --> 00:40:58,820
And he's currently banging Geraldine and Julie.

478
00:40:58,988 --> 00:41:00,988
And...

479
00:41:04,196 --> 00:41:08,696
He and his Turkish mother are here illegally.

480
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,860
That's it.

481
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:32,196
What are we doing here? 
-You're making people very happy.

482
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:38,444
Mr. Marwan's bank handles serious Saudi money 
and a whole bunch of Russian billionaires.

483
00:41:38,612 --> 00:41:43,444
What about any al Qaeda money? 
Anything promising?

484
00:41:43,612 --> 00:41:47,820
Ed, I'm up for a promotion soon; 
I will not forget my friends.

485
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:53,860
Thank you. This is all going kinda fast. I just sent some initial background.

486
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:57,072
There he is. The man.  
-Hello, Marwan.

487
00:41:57,236 --> 00:42:01,652
Dave. How wonderful to see you. 
-Good to see you too.

488
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,944
I counting, Marwan. 
You snuck in an extra half hour back there.

489
00:42:06,112 --> 00:42:10,236
I'm afraid she was merely listening to an old man's woes.

490
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:13,780
Oh, I see. 
-How are you, Marwan?

491
00:42:16,028 --> 00:42:19,572
I must tell you, Dave, since we met

492
00:42:19,736 --> 00:42:23,320
my life has got somewhat topsy-turvey.

493
00:42:23,488 --> 00:42:26,028
I'm sorry to hear that.

494
00:42:26,196 --> 00:42:30,696
But your colleague Charles has graciously offered his help.

495
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:35,780
So I owe him and you a great deal. 
-Can I ask what happened?

496
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:38,988
My daughter had a ...

497
00:42:39,152 --> 00:42:43,612
Marwan's daughter took too many sleeping pills. 
She's alright.

498
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:47,112
It had something to do with her boyfriend, 
who was recently deported.

499
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,944
We're trying to secure a visa for him.

500
00:42:50,112 --> 00:42:54,404
Even so, I'm afraid that Salma will...

501
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,072
I'm sorry. I won't trouble you with such matters.

502
00:42:58,236 --> 00:43:03,360
Hey. Talk as much as you want. Alright? 
Family comes first.

503
00:43:16,612 --> 00:43:19,572
Where is my beauty?

504
00:43:19,736 --> 00:43:23,152
I'm never like this.

505
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:28,236
You sit down, huh?  Just sit tight.

506
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,780
What the fuck's going on?

507
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:38,736
I've been acting quickly and effectively on very good
signals intelligence you provided.

508
00:43:38,904 --> 00:43:43,196
And if his daughter had died? 
-We could've used that, too.

509
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:46,528
Are you serious? What, in the name of a promotion?

510
00:43:48,612 --> 00:43:51,780
Marwan can't be away from his family right now.

511
00:43:51,944 --> 00:43:56,820
So in the morning, when he's facing jail, 
we're gonna offer him a deal.

512
00:43:56,988 --> 00:43:59,152
And he won't turn it down.
Jail? For what?

513
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:04,528
Drunk driving. Now, I want you to call the police.
Tell em you saw a Mercedes...

514
00:44:04,696 --> 00:44:07,944
No, he's not driving right now. 
Look at him, he'll kill himself.

515
00:44:10,528 --> 00:44:13,360
Okay. I'll call em. 
-Hey.

516
00:44:13,528 --> 00:44:15,944
He's not driving.

517
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:21,944
Remind me, are you authorized on any of the NSA programs you use?

518
00:44:22,112 --> 00:44:25,488
So we're both doin' a little fucked up shit here, uh?

519
00:44:25,652 --> 00:44:29,736
Watch yourself, Ed. 
-I will tell him who you are.

520
00:44:29,904 --> 00:44:35,528
You reveal the identity of an undercover officer, 
you're going to jail for a lot longer than Marwan.

521
00:44:56,404 --> 00:45:00,028
Hey. -Sorry I'm so late.

522
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:04,112
How was work?

523
00:45:06,072 --> 00:45:08,736
It was...

524
00:45:08,904 --> 00:45:10,696
alright.

525
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:16,944
I have to wake up in like, three hours. 
My flight's at seven.

526
00:45:20,652 --> 00:45:24,028
Better be quick, then.

527
00:46:08,488 --> 00:46:11,860
I will provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies

528
00:46:12,028 --> 00:46:14,696
with tools they need to track and take out the terrorists

529
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:18,028
without undermining our Constitution and our freedom.

530
00:46:18,196 --> 00:46:21,780
That means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens.

531
00:46:21,944 --> 00:46:26,652
No more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient.

532
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,280
Hey hon. -Hey.

533
00:46:29,444 --> 00:46:33,280
What happened to the London trip?

534
00:46:33,444 --> 00:46:35,696
Uh, turns out I'm not going.

535
00:46:38,944 --> 00:46:42,072
What's going on? Who's winning?

536
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,612
Still early.

537
00:46:52,944 --> 00:46:57,528
Obama ahead 67% to 32%. 
-Come on, big ears.

538
00:46:57,696 --> 00:47:00,236
...check out Florida.

539
00:47:04,652 --> 00:47:07,404
Holy shit, he's gonna win it.

540
00:47:07,572 --> 00:47:09,320
Florida?
-Yeah!

541
00:47:09,488 --> 00:47:12,904
That's big. 
-It's huge.

542
00:47:13,072 --> 00:47:17,360
You can act nonchalant, 
but I know you are starting to root for him.

543
00:47:17,528 --> 00:47:21,572
I've been watching your inner liberal grow. 
Which I will take a modest percentage of the credit for.

544
00:47:21,736 --> 00:47:24,612
And you deserve it.

545
00:47:27,196 --> 00:47:29,488
What is this?

546
00:47:32,904 --> 00:47:35,112
Oh, yeah, that.  Just leave that there.

547
00:47:37,028 --> 00:47:42,112
Russian hackers. 
Agency says they can activate webcams now.

548
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,072
That's creepy -Yeah, it's bothering me.

549
00:47:46,236 --> 00:47:51,028
Whatever.  It's not a big deal. You shouldn't even bother you. 
-It's not a big deal?

550
00:47:51,196 --> 00:47:54,320
What, that someone could be watching you right now?

551
00:47:54,488 --> 00:47:58,028
No, I'm not hiding anything.

552
00:47:58,196 --> 00:48:03,112
That's such a bullshit line. 
-What is?  
-Nothing to hide.

553
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,360
I don't. 
-Everyone does.

554
00:48:06,528 --> 00:48:09,572
Okay, well then what do I have to hide?

555
00:48:09,736 --> 00:48:13,488
Forget it. 
-No. What have I have to hide?

556
00:48:13,652 --> 00:48:17,072
No, let's just drop it 
-Apparently you think that I'm hiding something, so...

557
00:48:17,236 --> 00:48:22,488
Okay, the other day your computer was open and
I happened to notice you were on the site where we met

558
00:48:22,652 --> 00:48:26,404
...and you're looking at other guys.
-So you just were looking at my computer?

559
00:48:26,572 --> 00:48:30,360
I wouldn't have even brought this up. 
You asked me what do I have to hide,

560
00:48:30,528 --> 00:48:34,236
that's something you're not telling me.

561
00:48:36,488 --> 00:48:40,488
Well, it's... it's not...  I don't do anything. 
I don't meet any of those people.

562
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:48,112
You're gone for weeks at a time. So it's like 
I'm peering into other people's lives

563
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,404
because my own is just temporarily on hold.

564
00:48:51,572 --> 00:48:55,280
That sounds like an excuse. 
-It's the truth.

565
00:49:11,444 --> 00:49:17,736
I should've told you, and I didn't. Sorry.

566
00:49:17,904 --> 00:49:21,196
But it's not a big deal.

567
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:37,612
Look at me. I don't want anyone else.

568
00:49:38,696 --> 00:49:43,320
I do not want any other life. Okay?

569
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,652
Listen , uh...

570
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:07,404
I didn't go to London today because I resigned.

571
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:12,572
What? 
-Personal differences. A matter of principle.

572
00:50:14,152 --> 00:50:16,528
Can you tell me anything else?

573
00:50:19,612 --> 00:50:24,028
Did you get reposted? 
-No, I resigned the CIA.

574
00:50:25,236 --> 00:50:28,404
So what does that mean? What do we do
-I don't know.

575
00:50:28,572 --> 00:50:31,904
I'll figure it out, but listen...

576
00:50:33,152 --> 00:50:36,360
This is a good thing. Trust me.

577
00:50:41,196 --> 00:50:43,572
I do.

578
00:50:55,072 --> 00:50:57,736
He's gonna win .

579
00:50:59,404 --> 00:51:01,780
He better.

580
00:51:01,944 --> 00:51:08,612
CNN can now project that Barack Obama, 47 years old,
will become the president of the United States.

581
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:14,028
Every agency and department should know that this administration 
stands on the side

582
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:18,112
not on those who seek to withhold information 
but those who seek to make it known.

583
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:25,350
Janine is the website editor of a small, 
stateside office of a British newspaper

584
00:51:25,514 --> 00:51:28,558
up against the most powerful government in the world.

585
00:51:28,722 --> 00:51:30,058
She won't be bullied.

586
00:51:30,222 --> 00:51:35,806
We need to establish that we're not compromising national security by publishing.
-We need to have alternatives.

587
00:51:35,974 --> 00:51:40,930
Listen, Ed.  The real issue here is the day
the White House are aware that Janine has

588
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:44,222
leaked, top secret FISA court order,

589
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:49,558
anything could happen.  They subpoena the Guardian. For that matter,
they could break through that door any minute ending all of this.

590
00:51:50,682 --> 00:51:57,222
We are running out of time. We seriously have to think
about doing this on our own website. We have no choice.

591
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:01,014
You can't just start dumping articles on the Internet.

592
00:52:01,182 --> 00:52:04,014
Look at WikiLeaks. It destroyed their credibility.

593
00:52:04,182 --> 00:52:09,350
Look, Ed, you said it yourself, if this isn't done properly,
the world isn't going to take notice.

594
00:52:09,514 --> 00:52:14,930
You need experienced journalists to lead the public
 through some very, very complicated stories.

595
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:18,514
We are experienced journalists. 
-My feeling...

596
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:29,350
Has anyone called here before? 
-Not once. Not in three weeks.

597
00:52:29,514 --> 00:52:32,766
Well, shall I answer it? Tell them it's a wrong number.

598
00:52:34,182 --> 00:52:35,638
Yes?

599
00:52:36,806 --> 00:52:39,014
No I don't.

600
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:41,850
Okay. Thank you.

601
00:52:43,766 --> 00:52:46,722
Asked if I wanted turndown service and she said

602
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:50,474
the "do not disturb" sign was off the door.

603
00:53:06,682 --> 00:53:08,098
So?

604
00:53:09,058 --> 00:53:11,890
Do we wait or go on our own?

605
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:18,974
Look, I said from the beginning that how you publish is 
your business and I trust you.

606
00:53:19,138 --> 00:53:22,766
The only thing I ask is you study the data 
and you be responsible.

607
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:27,430
No names. No specifics. Anything ongoing that's critical, 
you don't release.

608
00:53:27,598 --> 00:53:31,138
Just stick to the issue of mass surveillance, and 
let the people decide.

609
00:53:31,306 --> 00:53:35,306
You have our word on that, but that's not the question.  
We have to ask...

610
00:53:36,306 --> 00:53:40,806
Right now the White House is arranging a conference call 
between Janine and the intelligence services.

611
00:53:40,974 --> 00:53:46,182
Now that's gonna happen in a few hours. 
Let's at least wait for that.

612
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:49,014
See what they say to her.

613
00:53:52,266 --> 00:53:54,350
I say we pause a moment.

614
00:53:55,930 --> 00:54:00,350
Yeah, I think we should reassemble in this 
room after the call takes place.

615
00:54:00,514 --> 00:54:04,138
So that's around midnight; be noon in New York. 
-Alright.

616
00:54:05,058 --> 00:54:07,850
I'll take another pass at the PRISM story in the meantime.

617
00:54:08,014 --> 00:54:12,350
We'll be in our hotel room if you need us, okay?

618
00:54:21,638 --> 00:54:24,930
You mind, maybe we take a break from that? For a second.

619
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:29,222
Yes, sorry.

620
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:34,974
You wanna take a look? Might make you feel better. 
It's not recording, just on standby.

621
00:54:39,638 --> 00:54:43,598
When did this start for you? 
Not wanting your photo taken?

622
00:54:43,766 --> 00:54:49,138
Uh, probably in Japan. 
Remember every time a camera pointed at me, it was...

623
00:54:50,138 --> 00:54:53,390
I couldn't breathe. 
-Why was that?

624
00:54:53,558 --> 00:54:58,098
I probably spent too much time looking at other people through cameras.

625
00:54:59,138 --> 00:55:01,514
Japan was your first NSA job, right?

626
00:55:01,682 --> 00:55:06,390
Yeah, well as a contractor; Dell. I had a lot of access.

627
00:55:06,558 --> 00:55:09,850
Why'd you go back after Geneva?

628
00:55:12,098 --> 00:55:15,558
Because of the money, and because I wanted to live in Japan.

629
00:55:15,722 --> 00:55:20,390
And because of Obama, actually. 
You know, I thought things were gonna get better with him.

630
00:55:23,722 --> 00:55:25,598
I was wrong.

631
00:55:28,682 --> 00:55:30,890
YOKOTA AIR BASE, TOKYO 2009

632
00:55:31,058 --> 00:55:33,306
What was it like there?

633
00:55:33,474 --> 00:55:37,222
Well, the first part of my day, 
I was building this round-the-clock backup system

634
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:39,514
called Epic Shelter.

635
00:55:39,682 --> 00:55:45,182
So if there was some catastrophe, say uh, 
terrorists burn down every embassy

636
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:49,138
and NSA post in the the Middle East, this program would ensure

637
00:55:49,306 --> 00:55:52,266
we wouldn't lose any of that data.

638
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:56,638
But then I would have to put it aside when visitors would show.

639
00:55:56,806 --> 00:56:02,638
NSA wanted to impress the Japanese. Show them our reach.

640
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:06,098
They loved the live drone feeds.

641
00:56:06,266 --> 00:56:09,890
This is Pakistan right now.

642
00:56:13,098 --> 00:56:16,638
They were not as thrilled to learn that we wanted them to help us

643
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:19,806
spy on the Japanese population.

644
00:56:19,974 --> 00:56:22,514
They said it was against their laws.

645
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:26,974
Of course, we tapped the entire country anyway.

646
00:56:27,138 --> 00:56:31,058
And we didn't stop there. 
Once we owned their communication systems

647
00:56:31,222 --> 00:56:34,138
started going after the physical infrastructure.

648
00:56:34,306 --> 00:56:40,014
We'd slipped these little sleeper programs 
into power grids, dams, hospitals.

649
00:56:40,182 --> 00:56:44,722
And the idea was if the day came when Japan was no longer an ally

650
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:47,430
it'd be lights out.

651
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:53,474
And it wasn't just the Japanese. We were planting malware in Mexico,

652
00:56:53,638 --> 00:56:56,474
Germany, Brazil, Austria.

653
00:56:57,974 --> 00:57:02,390
I mean, China I can understand. Or Russia or Iran. Venezuela, okay.

654
00:57:02,558 --> 00:57:04,682
But, Austria?

655
00:57:05,682 --> 00:57:10,514
You're also being ordered to follow most 
world leaders and heads of industry.

656
00:57:10,682 --> 00:57:15,474
You know, you're tracking trade deals, sex scandals, diplomatic cables

657
00:57:15,638 --> 00:57:19,558
to give the U.S. an advantage in negotiations at the G8

658
00:57:19,722 --> 00:57:23,266
or leverage over Brazilian oil companies.

659
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:27,638
Or helping to oust some third world leader 
who's not playing ball.

660
00:57:29,058 --> 00:57:34,182
And ultimately the truth sinks in that no matter 
what justification you're selling yourself

661
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:37,138
this is not about terrorism.

662
00:57:37,306 --> 00:57:39,930
Terrorism is the excuse.

663
00:57:42,722 --> 00:57:47,430
This is about economic and social control.

664
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:54,138
And the only thing you're really protecting is 
the supremacy of your government.

665
00:58:03,306 --> 00:58:06,558
Did you think about going to journalists then?

666
00:58:06,722 --> 00:58:10,638
No, that wouldn't have occurred to me back then.

667
00:58:10,806 --> 00:58:15,598
I thought that the system will self correct.

668
00:58:15,766 --> 00:58:19,598
The President will keep the promise that got him elected.

669
00:58:20,974 --> 00:58:24,514
That's actually when I started reading about you and your films.

670
00:58:24,682 --> 00:58:28,722
It was in Glenn's blog, you were being detained in airports for hours?

671
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:32,850
37 times. Investigating your own country's wars.

672
00:58:33,014 --> 00:58:36,430
That's why I'm going back to Berlin to edit.

673
00:58:36,598 --> 00:58:39,722
You can trust me with this 
-I do.

674
00:58:41,182 --> 00:58:45,390
I haven't trusted anyone in years.

675
00:58:48,514 --> 00:58:53,722
It was a welcome change when they put me on terrorism watch duty.

676
00:58:54,638 --> 00:58:58,474
Every day I'd go in and I'd get starting points for SIGINT.

677
00:58:58,638 --> 00:59:01,098
Signals intelligence.

678
00:59:02,306 --> 00:59:05,850
A lot of them were American, which felt strange

679
00:59:06,014 --> 00:59:08,306
but you just keep reminding yourself

680
00:59:08,474 --> 00:59:12,350
I could stop a dirty bomb attack and save thousands of lives.

681
00:59:12,974 --> 00:59:18,474
Thing is, you're not just following your bad guy targets, 
you're also following their metadata.

682
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:23,390
Which is basically, all the phone numbers that they're in touch with.

683
00:59:23,558 --> 00:59:29,806
Let's say your target is a shady Iranian banker 
operating out of Beirut.

684
00:59:29,974 --> 00:59:34,974
Okay, so, you're watching his stuff, but you're also watching 
all the people that he talks to.

685
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:40,138
Including, you know, his cousin who's 
just some dentist living in Buffalo.

686
00:59:40,306 --> 00:59:43,638
And then you've gotta watch all of that guy's contacts.

687
00:59:43,806 --> 00:59:48,766
And by the time you go a third hop out from the original target, 
you're watching this bartender

688
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:52,266
chat with her mother about Botox.

689
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:56,766
'Cause three hops from anyone with, say, 40 contacts...

690
00:59:56,930 --> 01:00:00,598
you're looking at a list of 2.5 million people.

691
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:08,682
And there's that moment when you're sitting 
there and the scale of it hits you.

692
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:13,098
The NSA is really tracking every cell phone in the world.

693
01:00:13,266 --> 01:00:17,598
No matter who you are, every day of your life, 
you're sitting in a database

694
01:00:17,766 --> 01:00:20,850
just ready to be looked at.

695
01:00:21,014 --> 01:00:23,182
I AGREE TO THE TERMS OF SERVICE AND THE PRIVACY POLICY

696
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:35,474
Not just terrorists or countries or corporations.

697
01:00:35,638 --> 01:00:37,430
But you.

698
01:00:45,598 --> 01:00:47,974
Was Lindsay with you in Japan?

699
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:52,722
Japan was difficult for us.

700
01:00:55,682 --> 01:00:58,890
I guess you couldn't talk about your work. 
-No.

701
01:01:01,222 --> 01:01:04,098
There was this one night, uh,

702
01:01:04,266 --> 01:01:08,890
towards the end, we were supposed to go climb Mt. Fuji the next day.

703
01:01:19,722 --> 01:01:24,474
Wow. Are you gonna post that on Twitter? 
-No. They're just for me.

704
01:01:25,558 --> 01:01:30,430
What do you think? 
-You should delete those.

705
01:01:30,598 --> 01:01:33,722
It's not quite the artistic critique I was going for.

706
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:38,098
I'm sorry, you just... you can't have stuff like 
that on your hard drive.

707
01:01:38,266 --> 01:01:42,306
Yes I can. 
-Can you just please, I'm asking you, can you delete them?

708
01:01:43,138 --> 01:01:46,306
Russian hackers again? 
-No.

709
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:49,598
Is it us?

710
01:01:52,306 --> 01:01:55,850
It's classified. 
-Am I a target?

711
01:01:56,014 --> 01:02:00,722
Of course not. 
-Clearly someone is looking at my nude portraits.

712
01:02:01,182 --> 01:02:05,306
Okay, I shouldn't have brought it up. 
Alright, it's skews of national security.

713
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:12,974
Well, I am flattered that my boobs are considered an issue 
of national security, but you're gonna have to do a lot better than that.

714
01:02:13,138 --> 01:02:16,222
I'd rather not talk about stuff that could land us in jail.

715
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:19,722
So that's what the band-aids are about then? 
And your camera phobia.

716
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:23,598
Because of work? Are they watching us?

717
01:02:23,766 --> 01:02:27,390
Who are they watching? 
-No one, okay. Let's just stop talking.

718
01:02:28,682 --> 01:02:34,890
Let's go to bed, and wake up in the morning, 
go climb this fucking mountain. Okay?

719
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:39,474
Of course we're not gonna talk about it.  
-What is that supposed to mean?

720
01:02:39,638 --> 01:02:42,514
It means that we don't talk about anything anymore.

721
01:02:42,682 --> 01:02:45,682
You work 12 hour days, you come home depressed.

722
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:48,350
You play fucking video games and then you fall asleep.

723
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:52,890
Yeah, I'm tired because I have a job, that's what pays 
for this apartment in the most expensive city in the world.

724
01:02:53,058 --> 01:02:56,850
Which you asked me to come to, 
knowing that I did not have a work visa.

725
01:02:57,014 --> 01:03:02,058
Okay, what if you had one, would you really give up your beautiful 
life of eating and sleeping and going out all the time?

726
01:03:02,222 --> 01:03:05,014
You think you'd really want a career? 
-A career like yours?

727
01:03:05,182 --> 01:03:07,430
Where I'm miserable all the time? No.

728
01:03:07,598 --> 01:03:10,890
That's called responsibility.

729
01:03:11,058 --> 01:03:12,722
Fuck this.

730
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:16,974
You know what? You have no idea what it's like 
to be accountable for other people's lives

731
01:03:17,138 --> 01:03:22,182
Because you live in a fairytale land where just, 
there are no consequences and no one ever gets hurt.

732
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:30,182
No. No you, you don't get hurt.

733
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:35,098
I get fucking crushed. 
-Fucking bullshit, I've done nothing to you.

734
01:03:35,266 --> 01:03:37,598
That's exactly right, you've done nothing!

735
01:03:37,766 --> 01:03:40,722
You don't hang out with me. You don't laugh with me.

736
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:43,390
You don't even fucking touch me anymore.

737
01:03:45,474 --> 01:03:48,222
Sorry. 
-Stop! No!

738
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:08,474
We never made it to Mount Fuji. 
Lindsay left pretty soon after that.

739
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:16,722
I was very lonely there. After three months, 
I left too, I went back to Maryland.

740
01:04:44,598 --> 01:04:49,182
I promised her I'd change, and we moved back in together.

741
01:04:49,350 --> 01:04:53,850
Make sure your knees stay bent, and then you can 
fully extend once you feel stable. Ready?

742
01:04:54,014 --> 01:04:58,890
1, 2, 3. All the way up. 
And you wanna clench between your knees.

743
01:04:59,058 --> 01:05:02,514
It'll burn, but it's a good burn. Perfect.

744
01:05:02,682 --> 01:05:04,766
Twirl around.

745
01:05:05,766 --> 01:05:08,182
Perfect! Oh my god, I'm so proud of you!

746
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:13,474
When you're really happy, there's a large part 
of you that just wants to stay happy.

747
01:05:17,558 --> 01:05:21,514
You start to think: What can be more important than this?

748
01:05:21,682 --> 01:05:26,182
What? Oh my god, it's so beautiful.

749
01:05:27,558 --> 01:05:31,474
You know, lots of people cruise happily through life.

750
01:05:32,974 --> 01:05:35,474
Why can't I?

751
01:05:35,638 --> 01:05:38,558
A MAN'S USEFULNESS DEPENDS UPON HIS LIVING UP TO HIS IDEALS

752
01:05:43,682 --> 01:05:45,890
I went back to work for the CIA.

753
01:05:47,014 --> 01:05:50,514
My official title was solutions consultant.

754
01:05:50,682 --> 01:05:54,058
Basically I was hawking overpriced hardware for a living.

755
01:05:54,222 --> 01:05:58,806
But I thought you'd resigned. 
-It was all contract work after Geneva.

756
01:05:58,974 --> 01:06:05,806
You know, it's Booz Allen Hamilton or Dell 
in partnership with CIA, or NSA, DIA.

757
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:10,974
It's the intelligence community's revolving door.

758
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:15,138
How was it, being back in the States?

759
01:06:15,306 --> 01:06:17,014
It was, uh...

760
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:19,722
It was really good to be home.

761
01:06:20,806 --> 01:06:24,682
But Maryland was where things started to turn for me.

762
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:32,390
Every time I felt like I was finally letting go of all the
anxiety and all the questions that used to keep me up at night,

763
01:06:32,558 --> 01:06:37,182
I'd learn something else and I just couldn't ignore it.

764
01:06:37,350 --> 01:06:43,974
Like, there were these three high-level officials at the NSA. 
Bill Binney, Ed Loomis and Kirk Wiebe.

765
01:06:44,138 --> 01:06:47,766
They'd been filing complaints about abuses and overreach for years.

766
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:52,138
That's all they did, they just filed complaints.

767
01:06:52,306 --> 01:06:55,222
And the FBI raided their homes.

768
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:58,182
And then there was Thomas Drake. Like the other three guys,

769
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:01,390
Drake was trying to change things from the inside.

770
01:07:01,558 --> 01:07:04,182
But when nothing worked, he did go to the press.

771
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:09,390
So they hit him with espionage act and we were shocked. 
The whole intel community.

772
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:12,890
Why do you think you were charged? 
-To send a chilling message.

773
01:07:13,058 --> 01:07:16,722
To whom? 
-To other whistleblowers. To others in the government.

774
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:21,390
No to speak out. Do not tell truth to power.

775
01:07:21,558 --> 01:07:23,638
We'll hammer you.

776
01:07:24,930 --> 01:07:29,806
There's a new program being developed at the NSA's ops center on Oahu.

777
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:34,558
You'd be going up against Chinese cyber divisions.

778
01:07:35,974 --> 01:07:37,974
You interested?

779
01:07:39,558 --> 01:07:41,930
Won't be the vast sums of money you're making now,

780
01:07:42,098 --> 01:07:46,890
but you'll be performing a critical service for your country, 
I know that's important to you.

781
01:07:47,058 --> 01:07:50,474
You mean service like in Geneva? 
-That was a mistake.

782
01:07:50,638 --> 01:07:53,722
Shouldn't have pushed you into that. 
-You didn't push me into it.

783
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:57,806
I asked for exposure to field ops, you gave it to me. 
I don't hold that against you.

784
01:07:59,058 --> 01:08:02,014
Is there something you do hold against me?

785
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:08,974
You didn't tell me we were running a 
Dragnet on the whole world, Corbin.

786
01:08:32,974 --> 01:08:35,430
Great shooting, Ed. 
-Thank you.

787
01:08:36,266 --> 01:08:38,098
That's terrific.

788
01:08:38,266 --> 01:08:41,474
So, one thing in the Army I was good at.

789
01:08:46,638 --> 01:08:51,182
You ever think, Ed, since the Second World War, 
it's been 60 years,

790
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:54,350
and still no WW3.

791
01:08:54,514 --> 01:08:59,974
Why? Because we use our power, generally, 
for the good of the world.

792
01:09:01,014 --> 01:09:03,806
For prosperity. Order.

793
01:09:03,974 --> 01:09:07,850
How can we defend ourselves against nuclear war, 
terror attacks,

794
01:09:08,014 --> 01:09:13,430
cyber attacks without a centralized intel factory 
working around the world night and day?

795
01:09:13,598 --> 01:09:17,058
So we should catalog billions of people's lives?

796
01:09:17,222 --> 01:09:20,638
Most people already catalog their lives with public consumption.

797
01:09:20,806 --> 01:09:26,098
Well, they catalog part of their lives, and they do it by choice.
We're not giving them the choice. We're just taking everything.

798
01:09:26,266 --> 01:09:30,682
Most Americans don't want freedom. They want security.

799
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:34,598
It's a simple bargain, if... Good girl. Good girl.

800
01:09:34,766 --> 01:09:38,558
If you want to play with all the new toys and be safe

801
01:09:38,722 --> 01:09:41,514
you pay the price of admission.

802
01:09:41,682 --> 01:09:46,222
But the people, they don't even know they've made that bargain.

803
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:49,430
Where's the battlefield, soldier?

804
01:09:50,558 --> 01:09:53,766
Everywhere. -What's the first rule of battle?

805
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:56,558
Never reveal your position.

806
01:09:56,722 --> 01:10:01,766
And if one unauthorized person knew? If Congress knew?

807
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:07,182
So would the enemy. 
-That, Mr. Snowden, is the state of the world.

808
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:11,390
Secrecy is security, and security is victory.

809
01:10:19,306 --> 01:10:20,890
Thank you, sir.

810
01:10:22,306 --> 01:10:24,638
Someone I want you to meet.

811
01:10:25,514 --> 01:10:29,638
Mr. Lowell. 
-Jim. How are you?

812
01:10:29,806 --> 01:10:33,014
Dorian. Allan. Welcome to the U.S.

813
01:10:33,182 --> 01:10:36,514
How'd you make out today, Corbin? 
-Aw, very mediocre.

814
01:10:36,682 --> 01:10:38,638
Nothing like Ed here.

815
01:10:38,806 --> 01:10:43,014
Apparently, the Army's training people to shoot straight 
-So this is Ed Snowden.

816
01:10:43,182 --> 01:10:46,430
Sir, a pleasure to meet you. 
-The brains behind Epic Shelter.

817
01:10:46,598 --> 01:10:48,682
It's brilliant work. 
-Thank you, sir.

818
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:51,306
Yeah, I had a few questions I wanted to ask you. 
-Jim ...

819
01:10:51,474 --> 01:10:55,182
Will you excuse me gentlemen? Excuse me. 
-Nice to meet you.

820
01:10:55,350 --> 01:10:59,350
Yeah, it's proving very useful for our UAV program.

821
01:10:59,514 --> 01:11:03,222
Yes, I heard. With foreign site intel transfer.
 

822
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:06,766
The transfers happen on collection now. 
They go stra

823
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:10,766
Mossad, if they need it; actionable immediately now, no one sees it.

824
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:14,930
It's improved the response time of our drone pilots by a factor of ten.

825
01:11:15,098 --> 01:11:19,474
Tell me, you worked signals intelligence in Japan too, yes? 
-Yes, sir.

826
01:11:19,638 --> 01:11:24,474
How'd you like it? 
-It was a very empowering job, sir.

827
01:11:24,638 --> 01:11:29,182
With this new job in Hawaii, there'd be even more access.

828
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:34,058
I asked Corbin to start the conversation, 
but the offer is mine.

829
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:40,430
Take your time. It's gonna take a few months 
to get this program on its feet.

830
01:11:40,598 --> 01:11:44,222
You'll excuse me, gentlemen? I see dinner.

831
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:48,222
Sir, for you? -Uh, no thank you.

832
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:57,598
Epic Shelter was meant as a backup program.

833
01:11:57,766 --> 01:12:00,766
Lowell's creating this position for you, Ed.

834
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:05,722
You'll be the first contractor outside Fort Meade 
working counter cyber.

835
01:12:06,682 --> 01:12:08,890
It's your ticket to the top.

836
01:12:20,014 --> 01:12:23,474
Do you believe the United States is the greatest country in the world?

837
01:12:23,638 --> 01:12:25,514
Yes.

838
01:12:26,558 --> 01:12:30,806
Have you used any programs you were unauthorized for?

839
01:12:36,558 --> 01:12:37,850
No.

840
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:53,166
We're not usually supposed to submit our own work,

841
01:12:53,334 --> 01:12:56,502
but my editor said she'd make an exception.

842
01:12:56,666 --> 01:12:58,418
Pretty neat, huh?

843
01:13:03,166 --> 01:13:05,750
I could just submit an entry.

844
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:10,958
You ignoring me on purpose or what?

845
01:13:11,126 --> 01:13:13,334
No, sorry.

846
01:13:14,582 --> 01:13:17,294
I was just thinking. 
-About what?

847
01:13:22,874 --> 01:13:27,750
I wonder if... talk to you about it at dinner, 
but let's just, wanna come sit down?

848
01:13:29,082 --> 01:13:32,002
Is everything okay? 
-Yeah.

849
01:13:35,210 --> 01:13:38,918
The, the uh, Deputy Director of the NSA

850
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:42,918
he offered me a new position.

851
01:13:43,082 --> 01:13:46,750
And uh, that was a while back, and now they need an answer.

852
01:13:46,918 --> 01:13:49,710
Well, is it something you want to do?

853
01:13:50,834 --> 01:13:53,542
I'd be good at it.

854
01:13:54,582 --> 01:13:57,210
Can you tell me anything about it?

855
01:13:57,374 --> 01:14:01,958
You know, I can't. 
-I know. Mission first.

856
01:14:03,794 --> 01:14:06,874
Are there social perks? White House galas, maybe?

857
01:14:07,042 --> 01:14:11,082
The position is in Hawaii.

858
01:14:18,918 --> 01:14:22,834
We worked really hard to get where we're at.

859
01:14:23,002 --> 01:14:26,418
And you're willing to just rip it all up, aye?

860
01:14:26,582 --> 01:14:29,710
We finally have house that we love and a job that I like,

861
01:14:29,874 --> 01:14:32,794
And real friends, and we're close to our families.

862
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:37,166
I know.  I understand. And if you want to stay, 
then we're staying. That's it.

863
01:14:37,334 --> 01:14:40,294
Don't just say that because I wanna hear it.

864
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:42,626
I'm not.

865
01:14:45,502 --> 01:14:49,374
I let you go once. I'm not gonna do it again.

866
01:14:55,542 --> 01:14:59,166
Shit, I'm sorry. The pasta. One second.
 

867
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:14,166
You know, I actually think I came pretty close to 
getting i

868
01:15:14,334 --> 01:15:17,210
I'm gonna get some candles.

869
01:15:54,794 --> 01:15:57,166
Ed. Ed?

870
01:16:14,794 --> 01:16:19,210
I know Tegretol. Know it slows you down. I've seen it with my mo.

871
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:22,294
She's taken all kinds of medications her whole life.

872
01:16:22,458 --> 01:16:25,418
Well, they work in 70% of cases.

873
01:16:27,542 --> 01:16:32,210
Ed, epilepsy is a serious condition. If you have a seizure

874
01:16:32,374 --> 01:16:36,250
driving yourself or with someone else in the car

875
01:16:36,418 --> 01:16:39,582
or you're in a place where you could fall...

876
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:44,710
This is not something to be lightly regarded. 
It's essential you commit yourself to this medication.

877
01:16:47,794 --> 01:16:49,458
Okay?

878
01:16:50,834 --> 01:16:52,418
Yeah.

879
01:16:57,794 --> 01:16:59,294
Oh, thank you.

880
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:07,196
I've been thinking about what the doctor said. About less stress.

881
01:17:09,904 --> 01:17:12,652
A warmer climate could help.

882
01:17:16,612 --> 01:17:20,696
If Hawaii is something that we decide would be better for you,

883
01:17:21,944 --> 01:17:24,320
I'll go.

884
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:39,904
HONG KONG
Wednesday - June 5, 2013

885
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:42,904
Janine, how did the White House conversation go?

886
01:17:43,072 --> 01:17:46,736
I made it quite clear that we were in possession 
of an authentic FISA court order.

887
01:17:47,126 --> 01:17:52,002
They wanted to see it; we refused. 
Now I just pray that it's actually authentic.

888
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:59,918
Are you actually questioning that? 
-No one has ever seen a FISA court order. There's no precedent here.

889
01:18:00,082 --> 01:18:02,918
Our source risked his life for that document. 
It's real.

890
01:18:03,082 --> 01:18:08,334
Tell us, did the White House make any specific 
claims about national security,

891
01:18:08,502 --> 01:18:11,294
that would prevent you from publishing?

892
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:16,458
No. I asked them repeatedly. 
And they had no substantive answer.

893
01:18:16,626 --> 01:18:19,874
Then there you go.  What more do you want?
You can go out, and know that you're safe.

894
01:18:20,042 --> 01:18:23,750
Glenn, I'd like to talk to Alan before we go any further.

895
01:18:23,918 --> 01:18:26,418
When does he land? 
-In six hours.

896
01:18:26,582 --> 01:18:30,874
No. Absolutely not.  We're sitting ducks here, Janine. 
It's 1pm in New York.

897
01:18:31,042 --> 01:18:34,750
If you don't get this out in the next four hours,
you'll miss the evening news on the East Coast.

898
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:38,458
But we can post later tonight.

899
01:18:38,626 --> 01:18:41,750
I'm sorry Glenn, but Alan's our editor in chief and I...

900
01:18:41,918 --> 01:18:44,918
Bullshit, the government knows that we have these documents now.

901
01:18:45,082 --> 01:18:49,166
The CIA could barge through this door any minute 
and you want more time.

902
01:18:49,334 --> 01:18:52,250
Act like a fucking journalist and stop stringing us along.

903
01:18:52,418 --> 01:18:55,334
I just stood my ground with the goddamn White House.

904
01:18:55,502 --> 01:18:58,874
I've risked my career. 
How dare you question my commitment to this story?

905
01:18:59,042 --> 01:19:01,750
Okay, let's just keep on... 
-No, you're right, I am questioning it.

906
01:19:01,918 --> 01:19:04,166
This is absolutely inappropriate.

907
01:19:04,334 --> 01:19:07,374
We are publishing ourselves. You're out.

908
01:19:17,502 --> 01:19:21,002
Alright, Glenn. We'll have it ready by 4pm.

909
01:19:21,166 --> 01:19:24,458
I have to go over the story once more 
-Why?

910
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:27,294
Because it still needs editing, damn you.

911
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:30,334
All this fucking intelligence jargon is hurting our brains.

912
01:19:30,502 --> 01:19:35,666
This PRISM story is still incomprehensible. 
-PRISM is the second story, Janine.

913
01:19:35,834 --> 01:19:40,250
Verizon is the first story. 
Have it ready to post by 4pm, 5 at the latest.

914
01:19:41,374 --> 01:19:44,918
No games, or we're gone.

915
01:20:01,874 --> 01:20:06,418
'THE TUNNEL' NSA OPS. CENTER
OAHU, HAWAII 
- 2012

916
01:20:07,834 --> 01:20:11,626
So my new job was counter-spying on the Chinese

917
01:20:11,794 --> 01:20:15,666
At the NSA regional cryptological center on Oahu.

918
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,666
You mind placing your bag down there, sir?

919
01:20:21,626 --> 01:20:25,042
No personal laptops, no usb sticks, no cell phones,

920
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:28,582
No electronic devices of any kind? 
-No, sir.

921
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:42,710
Thank you.

922
01:20:46,418 --> 01:20:49,958
Snow White, is that you?

923
01:20:51,502 --> 01:20:54,418
Gabriel? 
-Dude, what the hell are you doing here?

924
01:20:54,582 --> 01:20:56,582
Wow, this is amazing.

925
01:20:57,418 --> 01:21:02,666
What, do you work here? 
-Yeah, yeah. Three years, two months and uh, five days.

926
01:21:03,834 --> 01:21:06,126
But who's counting, right?

927
01:21:06,294 --> 01:21:09,042
It's like, who knew that a secret underground world war 2 air base

928
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:12,126
would become munchy heaven for a thousand geeks.

929
01:21:12,294 --> 01:21:15,794
So there's good pizza? 
-Good pizza, yeah, it's important. The elevator's slow as shit, though.

930
01:21:16,794 --> 01:21:19,374
Jesus. 
-It's something else, huh?

931
01:21:20,502 --> 01:21:26,126
So, what deck are you working on? 
-You NTOC or ROC?

932
01:21:28,918 --> 01:21:31,874
Between you and me? NTOC.

933
01:21:32,042 --> 01:21:35,250
Cool. You get to hack the hackers. 
You're coming up in the world.

934
01:21:45,458 --> 01:21:47,502
Fresh brains for you, Trevor.

935
01:21:47,666 --> 01:21:50,210
Trevor James, Interactive Ops, Division Chief.

936
01:21:50,374 --> 01:21:52,458
Ed Snowden. 
-I've been briefed.

937
01:21:52,626 --> 01:21:57,210
Next door's NTOC. Defense. That's where you'll be workin'.

938
01:21:57,374 --> 01:22:00,210
Over here we have ROC, our offense.

939
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:04,958
Now, I move between the two. We run a tight ship here, Snowden. 
-Yes, sir.

940
01:22:05,126 --> 01:22:09,002
You'll be workin' with Haynes. 
-Patrick Haynes. Good to you have you.

941
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:12,334
You watch out for him. The smartest guy in 
the building right here.

942
01:22:12,502 --> 01:22:15,250
Bro, how many languages do you speak again?

943
01:22:15,418 --> 01:22:19,374
Seven in Code, six spoken, two sign language.

944
01:22:19,542 --> 01:22:22,542
I some American Sign Language.

945
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:24,582
That's awesome.

946
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:29,042
Great. Another language I can't understand. 
-I'll check you later, Ed.

947
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:36,042
Wait for it.

948
01:22:37,334 --> 01:22:39,626
Any moment.

949
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:48,874
Lights over Waziristan, gentlemen. 
-So, what exactly do we contribute to this?

950
01:22:49,042 --> 01:22:52,334
The underside of that Reaper drone is fixed 
with a big ass antenna.

951
01:22:52,502 --> 01:22:55,582
Snarfing the hardware ID of anything that broadcasts.

952
01:22:55,750 --> 01:23:00,750
We, then geo locate em'. My friend Tasha here with 
the Air Force reins Hellfire. There she is now.

953
01:23:00,918 --> 01:23:04,210
Hey, Trev. You likin' the show? 
-You know it.

954
01:23:04,374 --> 01:23:07,834
We track 'em, you whack 'em. 
-And who did we just track?

955
01:23:08,002 --> 01:23:12,834
Not who, what. We're targeting bad guys' cell phones. 
Sometimes a SIM card.

956
01:23:13,002 --> 01:23:18,210
Okay. And how do we know the bad guy is in 
possession of the bad cell phone?

957
01:23:18,374 --> 01:23:22,918
We don't.
- Of course we do. JSOC and CIA have 
their people in the field.

958
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:26,250
What's the program name?

959
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:30,710
Epic Shelter. It was originally some backup program for uh...

960
01:23:32,166 --> 01:23:36,166
Catastrophic site failure. 
-Yeah. How did you know that?

961
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:43,750
I built it. -You?
-Yeah, you know actually, I've been thinking about another use for Epic Shelter.

962
01:23:45,042 --> 01:23:46,710
What'd you have in mind?

963
01:23:46,874 --> 01:23:50,750
Well, I was chatting with Jim Lowell about how there were so many programs...
-Deputy Director Lowell?

964
01:23:50,918 --> 01:23:57,294
Yeah, yeah. And we were saying there are so many programs nowadays,
it's kind of impossible to keep track of them anymore.

965
01:23:57,458 --> 01:24:00,374
Right? So why create a centralized database?

966
01:24:00,542 --> 01:24:04,126
Ah, like an index? 
-Yeah, exactly. Something that updates in real time.

967
01:24:04,294 --> 01:24:07,666
We've already got Epic Shelter collecting our finished intel.

968
01:24:07,834 --> 01:24:11,126
We just need a web portal to catalog it.

969
01:24:11,294 --> 01:24:14,542
Make it searchable. 
-Let me think about it.

970
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:18,918
In any case, I'd have to run it past Fort Meade. -Ôcourse.
-Did you have a name?

971
01:24:19,082 --> 01:24:22,750
Yeah, if it's not taken, I'd call it Heartbeat.

972
01:24:24,374 --> 01:24:25,918
Heartbeat.

973
01:24:26,082 --> 01:24:30,542
... five, four, three, two, one.

974
01:24:31,126 --> 01:24:33,250
Engage target.

975
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:50,502
You okay down there? 
-Yep.

976
01:24:51,794 --> 01:24:55,294
This is why I keep saying we need to hike more.

977
01:24:55,458 --> 01:24:57,710
You're right. 
-Hey, can you look at me?

978
01:25:00,042 --> 01:25:02,458
Come on. It's been years.

979
01:25:02,626 --> 01:25:06,042
By social media standards, you don't even exist anymore.

980
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:11,002
Just one. Smile. Show me your teeth.

981
01:25:12,750 --> 01:25:15,874
My elusive E. Finally captured.

982
01:25:16,042 --> 01:25:18,958
So now I'm a viable boyfriend? 
-Yes.

983
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:24,126
Such a shame. You used to be such a cute little model.

984
01:25:24,294 --> 01:25:27,210
Little? -Yeah.
-Oh, I was little? 
-Wait!

985
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,418
Stop.

986
01:25:32,918 --> 01:25:36,626
Oh my God. I think you've got some sun.

987
01:25:36,794 --> 01:25:41,542
I'm serious. It looks good. 
-Oh, that's impossible.

988
01:25:41,710 --> 01:25:46,710
Hey, um, I've been meaning to ask you, by the way, 
did you switch pharmacies?

989
01:25:47,834 --> 01:25:50,374
'Cause, I tried to pick up your prescription

990
01:25:50,542 --> 01:25:55,374
and I couldn't. Why did you do it?

991
01:25:57,502 --> 01:26:01,666
Uh, because I was there and thought it would be helpful.

992
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:16,542
I stopped taking the Tegretol.

993
01:26:18,002 --> 01:26:21,874
What? When? 
-Couple months ago.

994
01:26:22,042 --> 01:26:26,418
And you're just now telling me? 
-I wanted to tell you.

995
01:26:26,582 --> 01:26:29,082
I just... I can't take that stuff. 
It makes me groggy.

996
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:33,082
And I need to be sharp for work. 
I need to be on the ball all the time.

997
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:36,710
What is it about this fucking job that makes it 
more important than your life?

998
01:26:38,294 --> 01:26:41,374
I don't understand. 
-Our Government...

999
01:26:43,458 --> 01:26:45,210
Our government, what?

1000
01:26:45,374 --> 01:26:51,166
Our government is hemorrhaging billions of of dollars 
every year to Chinese hackers.

1001
01:26:51,334 --> 01:26:54,794
And I've been hired to shut them down.

1002
01:26:55,834 --> 01:26:59,874
A lot of people are depending on me.

1003
01:27:00,666 --> 01:27:03,210
More so than anyone else?

1004
01:27:04,458 --> 01:27:05,750
Yes.

1005
01:27:08,458 --> 01:27:12,210
No, this ... this is bullshit.

1006
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:19,834
Didn't come to Hawaii for you to heal, did we?

1007
01:27:20,750 --> 01:27:24,126
There's never going to be a less stressful job out there.

1008
01:27:24,294 --> 01:27:28,374
I feel like I'm made to do this, 
and if I don't do it, then

1009
01:27:28,542 --> 01:27:32,250
I don't know anybody else that can.

1010
01:27:33,294 --> 01:27:38,002
It's like I'm... 
I'm on a trajectory that I can't turn back from.

1011
01:27:41,374 --> 01:27:43,750
You can always turn back.
 

1012
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:51,626
What I wanted to see is if you could give me 
a yes or no answer to the qu

1013
01:27:51,794 --> 01:27:56,374
Does the NSA collect any type of data at all

1014
01:27:56,542 --> 01:28:01,126
on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?

1015
01:28:01,294 --> 01:28:04,542
No, sir. 
-It does not?

1016
01:28:05,666 --> 01:28:07,750
Not wittingly.

1017
01:28:07,918 --> 01:28:12,334
There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps collect,

1018
01:28:12,502 --> 01:28:15,418
but not--not wittingly. 
-Oh,really?

1019
01:28:15,582 --> 01:28:19,294
Thank you. IÕll have additional questions 
to give you in writing on that point...

1020
01:28:20,082 --> 01:28:25,666
Okay, so uh, what I wanted to show you guys is uh, 
this slide I ran across

1021
01:28:25,834 --> 01:28:28,626
while building this indexing program.

1022
01:28:28,794 --> 01:28:33,210
And what is this? 
-OK, so this is data collection for the month of March.

1023
01:28:33,374 --> 01:28:37,374
Worldwide. E-mails and Skype calls. France. 70 million.

1024
01:28:37,542 --> 01:28:39,750
Germany. 500 million.

1025
01:28:39,918 --> 01:28:42,458
Brazil. Two billion.

1026
01:28:42,626 --> 01:28:45,042
Inside the U.S.

1027
01:28:45,210 --> 01:28:50,250
3.1 billion e-mails and calls. That's not including 
any of the telco company data.

1028
01:28:50,418 --> 01:28:52,834
Okay, so what's the collection in Russia?

1029
01:28:53,002 --> 01:28:56,502
Russia is 1.5 billion.

1030
01:28:56,666 --> 01:29:01,082
Wait, so we're collecting twice as much in the U.S. as we are in Russia? 
-Yeah, I figured it would be a lot, but...

1031
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:03,334
This shit is out of hand, man.

1032
01:29:04,666 --> 01:29:07,458
Wait, have you shown this to anyone else? 
-No, you guys are the first.

1033
01:29:07,626 --> 01:29:12,002
Yeah, you know I'd be careful about that. 
It could seem like you're rocking the boat.

1034
01:29:12,166 --> 01:29:16,082
Yeah, you're right.  I just um, I needed to know 
if I was the only one that

1035
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:18,502
thought this was crazy.

1036
01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:21,666
The fuck's going on? -Hey, Trev. 
-What are you doing in here?

1037
01:29:21,834 --> 01:29:25,874
It's nothing. I was just showing them this one slide, 
I needed some input.

1038
01:29:26,042 --> 01:29:29,126
Why the heat map? 
-It's my bad, Trev.

1039
01:29:29,294 --> 01:29:32,874
I made a bet with Ed about which country 
we were collecting the most signals from.

1040
01:29:33,042 --> 01:29:36,294
He said Iran and I said Pakistan.

1041
01:29:36,458 --> 01:29:39,250
Who won? 
-Ed.

1042
01:29:42,334 --> 01:29:44,626
Yeah, I'm gonna head out.  I'll see you guys.

1043
01:29:44,794 --> 01:29:47,582
You're going down next time. 
-Yeah, okay.

1044
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:51,458
No more bets. 
And I don't want anyone unauthorized in here again.
 

1045
01:29:53,126 --> 01:29:55,250
Especially not with Heartbeat. 
-

1046
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:11,056
Happy Birthday!

1047
01:30:17,516 --> 01:30:21,388
In Vegas, looking at Afghanistan, so we're working late hours

1048
01:30:21,556 --> 01:30:24,888
This blurry object comes wandering into the strike zone.

1049
01:30:25,056 --> 01:30:29,516
We all knew that it was a kid. Poof, he's gone.

1050
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:34,096
Call in for clarification, report came back cold.

1051
01:30:34,264 --> 01:30:36,972
It was a dog. Okay, fine.

1052
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:41,264
Shift's long. Day and night.

1053
01:30:41,432 --> 01:30:44,596
The same village two, three days later.

1054
01:30:44,764 --> 01:30:48,432
We see the funeral. We knew it was the kid they buried.
 

1055
01:30:48,596 --> 01:30:53,264
Moms and dads were wailin'. And then the ord

1056
01:30:54,224 --> 01:30:56,932
Poof.

1057
01:30:57,096 --> 01:31:00,180
And they are gone in a cloud of dust.

1058
01:31:04,224 --> 01:31:07,304
I mean all of them. The whole fucking family.

1059
01:31:07,472 --> 01:31:11,264
But the crazy thing is that you come home after work

1060
01:31:11,432 --> 01:31:15,556
kiss the wife and kids, back to work the next day.

1061
01:31:15,724 --> 01:31:20,804
Pretty soon, you know, it just all becomes routine.

1062
01:31:23,596 --> 01:31:27,016
Fuck that. You make it sound criminal, man.

1063
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:31,016
It's war, it's a job. 
-I dunno know, man.

1064
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:35,388
Think jobs can't be criminal? 
-No, not if you're working for the government.

1065
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:38,516
You ever hear about the Nuremburg trials, Trev?

1066
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:41,680
They weren't that long ago. 
-Yeah.

1067
01:31:41,848 --> 01:31:44,224
And we hung the Nazi big shots, right?

1068
01:31:44,388 --> 01:31:48,848
Yeah. Well, the big shots were the first trial, but then the next trial

1069
01:31:49,016 --> 01:31:54,472
were just the judges, and lawyers, and police men, guards.

1070
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:59,680
Ordinary people just doing their jobs. Following orders.

1071
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:05,848
That's where we got the Nuremberg principles, which then, 
the UN made into international law

1072
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:11,304
just in case ordinary jobs become criminal again.

1073
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:16,472
Just sayin'.

1074
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:44,724
...even fucking touch me...

1075
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:03,848
Oh my God! 
-Dude, you okay?

1076
01:33:04,848 --> 01:33:08,348
You okay, man? -Get away. Don't touch him.

1077
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:42,972
Hey, Ed, how are you? How's your health?

1078
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:45,848
Hey, Corbin. Ah, it's...

1079
01:33:47,848 --> 01:33:50,432
It's fine. Thanks for asking.

1080
01:33:50,596 --> 01:33:54,140
It must be nerve racking, living with that condition.

1081
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:56,972
You wouldn't know it.  Look at your numbers.

1082
01:33:57,140 --> 01:34:00,848
200 Chinese IPs down in your first four months.

1083
01:34:02,972 --> 01:34:05,596
Those are uh, internal numbers.

1084
01:34:05,764 --> 01:34:09,556
Your colleague Trevor, is out of the CIA like you.

1085
01:34:09,724 --> 01:34:13,724
He's been keeping me informed of your progress.

1086
01:34:14,972 --> 01:34:19,140
It's outstanding work. Heartbeat, as well.

1087
01:34:19,304 --> 01:34:24,180
Thank you. Thanks. That means a lot. 
-Lowell is very pleased.

1088
01:34:24,348 --> 01:34:28,224
He sends his regards. 
-That's great to hear.

1089
01:34:29,056 --> 01:34:30,888
He um...

1090
01:34:34,016 --> 01:34:37,264
He doesn't know about your heat map conversations

1091
01:34:37,432 --> 01:34:41,264
or some of the ideas you've expressed to your colleagues.

1092
01:34:41,432 --> 01:34:44,764
And he's not going to. 
-Yeah, uh...

1093
01:34:45,972 --> 01:34:51,764
You know, Heartbeat is proving a tricky project. 
Collating from multiple agencies.

1094
01:34:51,932 --> 01:34:54,596
And knowing where to pull from.

1095
01:34:54,764 --> 01:34:58,972
It has helped to talk it over with colleagues.

1096
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:04,972
I believe in you. Which is why nothing to you 
after the derog in Geneva.

1097
01:35:06,224 --> 01:35:09,096
And I'm very grateful you've looked out for me.

1098
01:35:09,264 --> 01:35:15,432
Or after you "omitted the truth" in your polygraph.

1099
01:35:17,432 --> 01:35:20,432
What was it you were withholding exactly?
 

1100
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:31,724
You remember that day in class you were talking to us about

1101
01:35:33,016 --> 01:35:36,640
You said that they approved Bush's wiretapping programs.

1102
01:35:38,180 --> 01:35:42,224
Sometimes we're restricted from telling the whole truth.

1103
01:35:43,388 --> 01:35:47,432
Doesn't give us permission to lie. 
-Corbin.

1104
01:35:47,596 --> 01:35:51,264
The Director of National Intelligence just lied to Congress.

1105
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:56,016
Sorry.

1106
01:36:00,348 --> 01:36:02,140
Look at me.

1107
01:36:07,556 --> 01:36:11,388
Did you access an unauthorized program?

1108
01:36:11,556 --> 01:36:14,224
That I did not know about?

1109
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:23,680
Yes. It was, uh...

1110
01:36:25,516 --> 01:36:30,804
It was in Geneva, it was Lindsay, I was jealous. And I'm sorry.

1111
01:36:30,972 --> 01:36:33,516
I never did it again.

1112
01:36:46,180 --> 01:36:47,556
Listen...

1113
01:36:51,224 --> 01:36:54,932
I know it's been up and down with you and Lindsay since Geneva.

1114
01:36:55,096 --> 01:36:59,848
It's tough...keep any relationship going. Few of us do.

1115
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:08,972
So if it will give you any peace of mind, I can assure you 
she's not sleeping with that photographer friend of hers.

1116
01:37:10,304 --> 01:37:13,016
if that's what you're thinking.

1117
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:21,848
I have to go to a FIVE EYES conference in Sydney in a couple of week. 
I'll stop by Hawaii on the way back.

1118
01:37:23,764 --> 01:37:26,016
Okay?

1119
01:37:26,724 --> 01:37:29,264
Okay. Thank you.

1120
01:37:31,848 --> 01:37:34,056
I'll see you soon.

1121
01:37:49,264 --> 01:37:51,140
Hey Dad.

1122
01:37:52,304 --> 01:37:55,596
Did you get the e-mail I sent you with the photos?

1123
01:37:59,472 --> 01:38:02,472
I was hoping you could delete them.

1124
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:13,348
What are you doing?

1125
01:38:34,472 --> 01:38:36,432
Sit down.

1126
01:38:42,764 --> 01:38:47,056
Your e-mail is being monitored. 
-So?

1127
01:38:48,304 --> 01:38:52,016
Well, it's different now.  It's not passive collection. 
It's full tape surveillance.

1128
01:38:52,180 --> 01:38:55,472
It's your all of your e-mails, calls, texts, social media. Everything.

1129
01:38:55,640 --> 01:39:00,180
It's also possible that the house is bugged.

1130
01:39:00,348 --> 01:39:03,388
I'm not sure. 
-By who?

1131
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:07,348
By a senior officer at the CIA.

1132
01:39:08,472 --> 01:39:12,224
You in trouble? Is it the Chinese thing?

1133
01:39:12,388 --> 01:39:16,016
Look, there's things that I wish I could tell you

1134
01:39:16,180 --> 01:39:20,804
but I can't because you could get very hurt.

1135
01:39:20,972 --> 01:39:24,016
What's keeping you safe is that you don't know anything.

1136
01:39:30,596 --> 01:39:34,140
I'm sorry. I really am.  I didn't want any of this for you.

1137
01:39:35,804 --> 01:39:40,180
But I know you would think I was doing the right thing.

1138
01:39:44,932 --> 01:39:51,516
So just listen to me for a sec, okay? When we go back in the house, 
everything has to appear normal.

1139
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,848
We're gonna act like nothing is changed.

1140
01:39:54,016 --> 01:39:58,056
But if you do notice something that's weird, you need to tell me right away.

1141
01:39:58,224 --> 01:40:02,224
And you're gonna use encrypted e-mail that I'm setting up for you.

1142
01:40:02,388 --> 01:40:06,472
I don't think I can do this. 
-Yes, you can. I know you can.

1143
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:12,264
Do I even have a choice? 
-I'm asking you to trust me.

1144
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:24,724
Linz, I think it'd be best if you went back to Maryland for a while.

1145
01:40:24,888 --> 01:40:28,680
Tell your parents that I'm away on a business trip.

1146
01:40:28,848 --> 01:40:33,140
And that you're homesick. 
-Are you going away?

1147
01:40:33,304 --> 01:40:36,016
Yes, but just for a little while.

1148
01:40:45,432 --> 01:40:49,724
No, I can't go. -Please, just until I get back?
-I can't go.

1149
01:40:51,224 --> 01:40:55,680
You just said that we have to appear like nothing's changed.

1150
01:40:55,848 --> 01:40:59,804
If both of us left at the same time, wouldn't that seem suspicious?

1151
01:41:09,932 --> 01:41:12,724
I will do this for you.

1152
01:41:16,388 --> 01:41:18,932
But it is the last time.

1153
01:41:41,596 --> 01:41:45,680
We will meet in the mall, opposite the Mira Hotel, 
on the Monday two weeks from now.

1154
01:41:45,848 --> 01:41:49,640
I will be holding a Rubik's cube. More to follow...

1155
01:41:54,932 --> 01:41:57,016
You hear about Trevor, bro?

1156
01:41:57,180 --> 01:42:00,432
You know that op to own the Internet in Syria?

1157
01:42:00,596 --> 01:42:04,888
Yeah, Trevor and his TIO team crashed the core router.

1158
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:08,224
The whole country has gone dark. 
-Jesus Christ.

1159
01:42:08,388 --> 01:42:11,304
Figure it out! 
-Poor bastards.

1160
01:42:13,264 --> 01:42:16,096
K, I'm gonna, uh, I gotta get to work. 
-Yeah, yeah, me too.

1161
01:42:17,264 --> 01:42:20,724
Oh, hey. How's Heartbeat coming?

1162
01:42:21,932 --> 01:42:25,596
It's close. It's very close.

1163
01:42:28,516 --> 01:42:31,096
Don't tell me you're involved in this too.

1164
01:42:31,264 --> 01:42:36,596
Well, Trevor fucking roped me into going through the 
zero day exploit codes. It's a big fucking mess, man.

1165
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:42,140
Why did I agree to it? 
-Good luck.

1166
01:45:08,180 --> 01:45:11,764
Hung em like an ?? out to dry. 
-Yeah.

1167
01:45:12,932 --> 01:45:15,016
Trouble with the Navy?

1168
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:19,388
One of those idiots ripped some bullshit piece of Israeli 
Code and jammed it down our payload.You fuckin' believe that?

1169
01:45:19,556 --> 01:45:23,388
Script kiddies? 
-I know, I know. I should have listened to you. Goddammit.

1170
01:45:23,556 --> 01:45:25,304
Is this it? 
-Here it is.

1171
01:45:25,472 --> 01:45:28,516
The Israelis must fucking take the fall for this.

1172
01:45:32,472 --> 01:45:35,724
I'm not taking the fall for this.

1173
01:45:44,388 --> 01:45:45,972
Patrick.

1174
01:45:51,056 --> 01:45:53,640
I might not see you again.

1175
01:45:55,972 --> 01:45:59,096
You gonna leave me here...

1176
01:45:59,264 --> 01:46:01,848
with Captain America?

1177
01:46:02,016 --> 01:46:03,680
Thanks a lot.

1178
01:46:05,348 --> 01:46:09,848
The NSA may come after you.

1179
01:46:11,264 --> 01:46:14,016
I don't know what you're talking about.

1180
01:46:48,388 --> 01:46:52,640
You headed home already? 
-Yeah. I'm not feeling so well.

1181
01:46:53,804 --> 01:46:56,388
Might not be in tomorrow either.

1182
01:46:56,556 --> 01:46:59,680
You know, Trevor's kinda busy, maybe you could let him know for me?

1183
01:46:59,848 --> 01:47:02,056
Yeah, it'd be my pleasure.

1184
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:09,516
You know, if you're uh, if you're really not feeling well, dude,
maybe you should go back to the States and see your doctor.

1185
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:13,264
I think that, you know, folks would understand that.

1186
01:47:15,596 --> 01:47:17,640
Sounds like a smart thing.

1187
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:28,016
Take care of yourself. 
-Yeah, you too, bro.

1188
01:47:51,474 --> 01:47:54,018
Hey, you ever play with one of these?

1189
01:47:54,182 --> 01:47:57,142
Yeah, when I was a kid.

1190
01:47:57,310 --> 01:48:00,726
You should try it. It's hard.

1191
01:48:19,894 --> 01:48:22,974
I can't figure this out.

1192
01:48:27,518 --> 01:48:29,182
I don't know about this.

1193
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:33,974
You gotta start with a white cross, actually, 
then you do the corners.

1194
01:48:34,142 --> 01:48:37,434
Ah man, well I love these things.

1195
01:48:37,602 --> 01:48:40,850
Hey, have a good weekend, man. 
-You too, buddy.

1196
01:49:36,088 --> 01:49:38,960
It's live.

1197
01:49:39,128 --> 01:49:41,836
WEDNESDAY, June 5, 2013

1198
01:49:42,420 --> 01:49:46,044
There's a link to the FISA court order.

1199
01:49:51,960 --> 01:49:55,836
Well done, Janine. I told you she was no pushover.

1200
01:49:56,004 --> 01:49:59,712
Well, it feels so goddamn good to be wrong.

1201
01:50:01,880 --> 01:50:06,172
NSA collecting phone records of millions of Americans daily.

1202
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:10,252
Breaking news tonight. Reports that through a secret court order, 
the Obama administration

1203
01:50:10,420 --> 01:50:13,380
is collecting the phone records of millions of Verizon customers.

1204
01:50:13,544 --> 01:50:16,460
That's been reported by The Guardian newspaper in the UK.

1205
01:50:16,628 --> 01:50:22,212
They said court order shows that all the information is going to the National Security Agency.
CNN has reached out to multiple sources to confirm t

1206
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:24,796
How is that for mainstream media, Glenn?

1207
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:29,504
They can't shut this down now, we've got four days more days of it.
-They have no idea what they're in store for.

1208
01:50:29,672 --> 01:50:32,296
It's fantastic.

1209
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:37,672
Another explosive article, has just appeared, 
this time in the Washington Post.

1210
01:50:37,836 --> 01:50:43,088
It's breaking news that it reveals another broad 
and secret U.S. government surveillance program.

1211
01:50:43,252 --> 01:50:47,296
The Washington Post and the Guardian in London reporting

1212
01:50:47,460 --> 01:50:53,588
that the NSA and the FBI are tapping directly 
into the central servers of nine leading internet companies

1213
01:50:53,752 --> 01:50:57,336
including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, AOL,

1214
01:50:57,504 --> 01:51:00,088
Skype, YouTube, and Apple.

1215
01:51:00,252 --> 01:51:04,672
The Post says they're extracting audio, 
video, photographs, e-mails, documents,

1216
01:51:04,836 --> 01:51:10,628
and connection logs that enable analysts to 
track a person's movements and contacts over time.

1217
01:51:10,796 --> 01:51:13,920
FRIDAY, June 7, 2013

1218
01:51:14,088 --> 01:51:20,836
In the abstract, you can complain about Big Brother 
and how this is a potential program run amok,

1219
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:26,836
but when you actually look at the details, 
then I think weÕve struck the right balance.

1220
01:51:27,004 --> 01:51:31,712
U.S. President Barack Obama staunchly 
defends U.S. government programs

1221
01:51:31,880 --> 01:51:35,336
insisting that they were conducted with broad safeguards

1222
01:51:35,504 --> 01:51:39,252
to protect against abuse.

1223
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:44,252
He reached the conclusion that what was happening 
inside this really secretive agency

1224
01:51:44,420 --> 01:51:50,628
was very threatening and menacing to privacy rights, 
to Internet freedom, to basic political liberty.

1225
01:51:50,796 --> 01:51:55,672
Not only in the United States but all around the world. 
And he felt it was his duty

1226
01:51:55,836 --> 01:51:58,920
as a human being to disclose it.

1227
01:52:08,752 --> 01:52:13,336
My name is Ed Snowden. I'm 29 years old. 
I work for Booz Allen Hamilton.

1228
01:52:13,504 --> 01:52:16,880
as an infrastructure analyst for NSA in Hawaii.

1229
01:52:29,796 --> 01:52:33,960
Well, you can't come forward against the most 
powerful intelligence agencies in the world

1230
01:52:34,128 --> 01:52:38,920
without expecting to have some risk. 
They're just such powerful adversaries.

1231
01:52:39,088 --> 01:52:45,836
No one can meaningfully oppose them. 
If they wanna get you, they will get you in time.

1232
01:52:46,004 --> 01:52:48,044
The kid did it.

1233
01:52:48,212 --> 01:52:54,044
...get worse for the next generation, if they extend 
the capabilities of this sort of architecture of oppression.

1234
01:52:54,212 --> 01:52:58,672
Then you realize that you might willing to accept any risk

1235
01:52:58,836 --> 01:53:04,544
as long as the public is able to make their 
own decision about how this is applied.

1236
01:53:04,712 --> 01:53:08,172
Because, even if you haven't done anything wrong, 
you're being watched.

1237
01:53:10,004 --> 01:53:13,336
I had access to the entire intelligence community.

1238
01:53:13,504 --> 01:53:16,544
So if I had wanted to harm the U.S.

1239
01:53:16,712 --> 01:53:20,712
...you could shut down the entire analyst system in an afternoon.

1240
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:27,504
But that was never my intention, and 
I think anybody that's making that argument

1241
01:53:27,672 --> 01:53:29,628
They have to think.

1242
01:53:29,796 --> 01:53:32,088
If they were in my position

1243
01:53:32,252 --> 01:53:35,836
Living in Hawaii, in paradise, making a ton of money,

1244
01:53:36,004 --> 01:53:40,920
what would it take, to make you leave everything behind?

1245
01:53:41,088 --> 01:53:44,796
The fear that I've had most

1246
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:49,252
in regards to the outcome for America with these disclosures

1247
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:54,420
is that nothing will change in the coming months, 
and the coming years, it will just get worse.

1248
01:53:54,588 --> 01:53:58,252
And then, eventually, at some point

1249
01:53:58,420 --> 01:54:01,880
some new leader will be elected

1250
01:54:02,044 --> 01:54:06,128
who flips the switch

1251
01:54:06,296 --> 01:54:13,672
and the people won't be able to do anything by 
that point to oppose it.

1252
01:54:13,836 --> 01:54:18,336
And it'll be turnkey tyranny.

1253
01:54:18,504 --> 01:54:22,588
How you holdin' up? 
-Yeah, I'll be fine.

1254
01:54:22,752 --> 01:54:25,752
You guys have to start watching after yourselves now.

1255
01:54:27,252 --> 01:54:33,960
You know, if you have any reason to believe that you're about to

1256
01:54:34,128 --> 01:54:39,544
be raided or intercepted or breached in any way, 
you format and destroy all the data immediately.

1257
01:54:39,712 --> 01:54:42,504
You have the encrypted backups.

1258
01:54:42,672 --> 01:54:44,920
Now I...

1259
01:54:47,544 --> 01:54:51,960
I no longer have any access to these files, myself. You guys have them all.

1260
01:54:56,212 --> 01:55:00,544
Keep the focus on the stories. That's all that matters.

1261
01:55:00,712 --> 01:55:04,004
If you'll excuse me, it's...

1262
01:55:05,128 --> 01:55:08,296
We should all get some rest.  We could use it.

1263
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:12,588
Yeah, I should probably lay down in a soft bed, 
while I still have one available, right?

1264
01:55:14,252 --> 01:55:16,380
Rest well. 
-Thank you.

1265
01:55:18,460 --> 01:55:21,336
See you tomorrow. 
-Good night.

1266
01:55:50,088 --> 01:55:54,252
Can you at least tell me where you're going?

1267
01:56:17,172 --> 01:56:20,044
Listen, I know that I... 
-Shh.

1268
01:56:29,296 --> 01:56:32,460
MONDAY, June 10, 2013

1269
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:40,088
Ewen, I'm on the second floor.

1270
01:56:40,252 --> 01:56:42,420
I don't see Tibbo.

1271
01:56:44,128 --> 01:56:46,712
No, no-no, wait, I think I see him.

1272
01:56:46,880 --> 01:56:51,380
Shit. There's press swarming all over the hotel.

1273
01:56:51,544 --> 01:56:55,088
Yeah, I don't know. I'll figure it out and 
I'll stop them with a press conference or something.

1274
01:56:55,252 --> 01:57:01,252
Look, we really appreciate this you're one 
of the best lawyers in Hong Kong.

1275
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:06,752
We're gonna take him to the UN first, then 
I prefer not to reveal. I understand...

1276
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:10,672
Shit, they've spotted me. You guys get going.

1277
01:57:12,420 --> 01:57:16,296
I will answer your questions in an orderly fashion. Please.

1278
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:19,504
Did you get them? 
-Yeah, this is the best I could do.

1279
01:57:19,672 --> 01:57:22,712
You'll be meeting Tibbo in five minutes.

1280
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:26,752
On the skybridge opposite the large mall.

1281
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:33,628
I've met a lot of astonishing people in my life, but you...

1282
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:38,544
Okay, laddie, off you go.

1283
01:57:38,712 --> 01:57:41,296
I won't let you down.

1284
01:57:41,460 --> 01:57:45,212
You'd make a shitty journalist without a camera.

1285
01:57:45,380 --> 01:57:47,836
You sure?

1286
01:57:48,004 --> 01:57:51,296
Okay. That's a pretty good idea.

1287
01:57:52,796 --> 01:57:55,044
Thanks.

1288
01:57:56,044 --> 01:57:58,504
You don't want to leave your luck behind.

1289
01:57:58,672 --> 01:58:02,628
Oh, I think I'd like you to have that.

1290
01:58:03,960 --> 01:58:07,960
Thanks. For everything. 
-Thank you.

1291
01:58:31,588 --> 01:58:33,880
I have a van on the street.

1292
01:58:38,088 --> 01:58:41,672
NSA leaker Edward Snowden has now been charged formally with

1293
01:58:41,836 --> 01:58:46,420
espionage, theft and conversion of government property.

1294
01:58:46,588 --> 01:58:51,004
US officials have asked Hong Kong to detain the 
former contractor on provisional arrest warrant.

1295
01:58:51,172 --> 01:58:55,088
Snowden has been in Hong Kong since May. 
-Reportedly, on May 20th...

1296
01:58:58,172 --> 01:59:02,504
Snowden has checked out of the luxury hotel 
in Hong Kong where he had been holed up.

1297
01:59:04,380 --> 01:59:06,088
You might turn your eyes away.

1298
01:59:06,252 --> 01:59:10,088
The Justice Department had to go to Interpol, so that Snowden,

1299
01:59:10,252 --> 01:59:15,088
if he tried to cross a border, he could be intercepted and detained.

1300
01:59:15,252 --> 01:59:19,796
So, again the Americans are now closing in. 
They almost certainly know where he is.

1301
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:25,836
They just need Hong Kong's approval to get him.
-The Hong Kong government does have an extradition 
agreement with Washington, but the ultimate d

1302
01:59:27,544 --> 01:59:31,752
The big question here is: Where is he now?

1303
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:38,296
Thank you. This is Ed. Ed, Mayana. 
-Welcome.

1304
01:59:41,628 --> 01:59:44,920
These are good people. They won't talk.

1305
01:59:45,088 --> 01:59:48,172
I've been handling their cases for years. They're like you. 
-That's so nice.

1306
01:59:48,336 --> 01:59:50,296
They're stateless. 
-Yeah.

1307
01:59:50,460 --> 01:59:55,044
So, we're waiting on the UN application for refugee status. 
-Yeah.

1308
01:59:55,212 --> 01:59:59,380
Just in case you're arrested, this is where you can call me. 
-Yeah.

1309
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:04,920
Good. -Thank you so much.

1310
02:00:08,544 --> 02:00:12,212
You may not feel it, Ed,

1311
02:00:12,380 --> 02:00:15,172
but you're not alone.

1312
02:00:18,296 --> 02:00:21,836
His longtime girlfriend, Lindsay Mills, 
an amateur photographer

1313
02:00:22,004 --> 02:00:27,212
has not been heard from. It's believed she's in 
seclusion in her parents' home in Maryland

1314
02:00:27,380 --> 02:00:32,504
and has been questioned by the FBI and remains under investigation.

1315
02:00:32,672 --> 02:00:36,420
Ten days have now gone by as the world looks for Edward Snowden.

1316
02:00:36,588 --> 02:00:39,960
Rumors have surfaced that a rich supporter is hiding Snowden

1317
02:00:40,128 --> 02:00:43,796
somewhere in the Hong Kong hills in a private mansion.

1318
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:19,960
It is now confirmed that Edward Snowden has boarded 
a flight from Hong Kong to Moscow.

1319
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:25,336
The State Department is very disappointed in the 
authorities in Hong Kong for letting Snowden go.

1320
02:01:25,504 --> 02:01:27,920
He was accompanied by a representative from WikiLeaks.

1321
02:01:28,088 --> 02:01:33,588
Snowden is trying to make his way from Russia to Cuba 
and then to Ecuador for political asylum.

1322
02:01:33,752 --> 02:01:37,128
Moscow airport officials say he won't be permitted 
to make his connected flight

1323
02:01:37,296 --> 02:01:39,752
because the U.S. government has revoked his passport.

1324
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:44,044
The United States Secretary of State 
John Kerry is outraged

1325
02:01:44,212 --> 02:01:46,504
that Russia is refusing to arrest 
the American fugitive.

1326
02:01:46,672 --> 02:01:50,752
Now a man without a country is stranded 
inside the Moscow airport.

1327
02:01:50,920 --> 02:01:53,460
No, I'm not going to be scrambling jets

1328
02:01:53,628 --> 02:01:58,128
to get a 29-year-old hacker.

1329
02:01:59,380 --> 02:02:03,628
The president of Bolivia's plane was forced 
down in Austrian airspace today

1330
02:02:03,796 --> 02:02:07,796
on U.S. suspicions that Snowden may have been on board.

1331
02:02:07,960 --> 02:02:12,544
After 39 days at the airport hotel, 
he slept with his Russian lawyer

1332
02:02:12,712 --> 02:02:16,252
and a legal adviser from WikiLeaks, Sarah Harrison.

1333
02:02:16,420 --> 02:02:22,004
He can now enjoy all of the the sweet, sweet liberty 
allowed under the regime of president Vladimir Putin.

1334
02:02:22,172 --> 02:02:25,296
There is still a thing called execution.

1335
02:02:25,460 --> 02:02:28,044
Mr. Snowden actually deserves asylum 
and protection around the globe

1336
02:02:28,212 --> 02:02:31,752
but he does have asylum in Russia, at least.

1337
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:33,420
He can engage in the debate he started.

1338
02:02:33,588 --> 02:02:36,628
And now the world now has an example 
that you can do the right thing.

1339
02:02:36,796 --> 02:02:40,420
You don't have to end up in a cage, one room, a prison.

1340
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:45,252
After more than a year in the country under temporary asylum

1341
02:02:45,420 --> 02:02:50,628
Edward Snowden has received a three year residency permit in Russia.

1342
02:02:58,642 --> 02:03:03,014
And now, here, live from Moscow, Edward Snowden.

1343
02:03:05,058 --> 02:03:07,806
Hi, Ed. How are you doing?

1344
02:03:12,266 --> 02:03:16,806
Thank you. Uh, forgive me if I get my bearings a little bit here.

1345
02:03:16,974 --> 02:03:20,890
People always said I was kind of a robot.

1346
02:03:21,058 --> 02:03:23,014
How is it that you came to be in Russia?

1347
02:03:23,182 --> 02:03:27,850
Well, I never intended to come here, you know. 
My passport was revoked

1348
02:03:28,014 --> 02:03:32,182
on route to Latin America, so when people say, 
why are you in Russia?

1349
02:03:32,350 --> 02:03:35,806
I say: "Ask the State Department."

1350
02:03:35,974 --> 02:03:39,930
Does that mean you're willing to go back and face trial?

1351
02:03:40,098 --> 02:03:44,182
Absolutely. If it was a fair and public trial.

1352
02:03:44,350 --> 02:03:47,682
Unfortunately that's not what would happen right now

1353
02:03:47,850 --> 02:03:51,806
as long as the Espionage Act is being used against whistleblowers.

1354
02:03:53,014 --> 02:03:55,974
Do you still think it was worth it? 
-Yes, I do.

1355
02:03:56,142 --> 02:04:02,014
Without the information to start a public debate, we're lost.

1356
02:04:02,182 --> 02:04:08,430
You know, the people being able to question 
our government and hold it accountable.

1357
02:04:08,598 --> 02:04:13,430
that's the principle that the United States of America was founded on.

1358
02:04:13,598 --> 02:04:17,266
So, if we want to protect our national security

1359
02:04:17,430 --> 02:04:20,850
we should be protecting that principle.

1360
02:04:21,014 --> 02:04:26,514
What if your argument falls on deaf ears, 
what if our leaders don't act?

1361
02:04:26,682 --> 02:04:30,350
I believe that if nothing changes,

1362
02:04:30,514 --> 02:04:35,642
more and more people all over 
the world will come forward.

1363
02:04:35,806 --> 02:04:41,682
Whistleblowers and journalists, 
but also regular citizens.

1364
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:45,974
And when those in power try to hide

1365
02:04:46,142 --> 02:04:51,514
by classifying everything, 
we will call them out on it.

1366
02:04:51,682 --> 02:04:57,806
And when they try to scare us into 
sacrificing our basic human rights,

1367
02:04:57,974 --> 02:05:02,306
we won't be intimidated. 
And we won't give up.

1368
02:05:02,474 --> 02:05:06,474
And we will not be silenced.

1369
02:05:06,642 --> 02:05:11,642
You're alone in a foreign country. 
You'll be extradited if you try to leave.

1370
02:05:11,806 --> 02:05:14,306
That must be hard.

1371
02:05:26,182 --> 02:05:28,766
When I left Hawaii, I lost...

1372
02:05:28,930 --> 02:05:31,222
...everything.

1373
02:05:33,474 --> 02:05:36,350
You know, I had a stable life.

1374
02:05:38,514 --> 02:05:42,806
Stable love. Family. Future.

1375
02:05:44,182 --> 02:05:47,098
And I lost that life, but...

1376
02:05:49,182 --> 02:05:51,890
...I've gained a new one.

1377
02:05:53,430 --> 02:05:55,642
And I'm incredibly fortunate.

1378
02:05:57,974 --> 02:06:00,430
And I think,

1379
02:06:00,598 --> 02:06:04,350
the greatest freedom that I've is the fact that 
I no longer have to worry about

1380
02:06:04,514 --> 02:06:09,514
what happens tomorrow, because I'm happy with 
what I've done today.

1381
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:18,334
Live from the Internet, Edward Snowden.

1382
02:07:05,542 --> 02:07:08,418
As of this date, Edward Snowden resides in Moscow.

1383
02:07:08,586 --> 02:07:14,210
Lindsay Mills has moved there to join him.

1384
02:07:35,586 --> 02:07:41,126
Has your mind changed about him? Is he now more of 
a whistleblower than he is a hacker?

1385
02:08:18,626 --> 02:08:22,166
What is going to happen to Edward Snowden? 
-He's gonna die in Moscow.

1386
02:08:22,334 --> 02:08:24,750
He's not coming home.

1387
02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:03,542
Snowden, is he a traitor or a hero?

1388
02:09:03,710 --> 02:09:06,794
He stole very important information.

1389
02:09:25,626 --> 02:09:26,918
We have breaking news tonight.

1390
02:09:27,086 --> 02:09:31,374
Among the reports, work with Congress to change 
how the NSA collects phone records.

1391
02:09:31,542 --> 02:09:34,710
...more transparency by the secret court

1392
02:09:34,874 --> 02:09:37,294
that regularly approves the surveillance...

1393
02:09:38,666 --> 02:09:43,586
Is it a victory for Edward Snowden? That's gonna depend 
on the eye of the beholder.

1394
02:09:43,750 --> 02:09:46,586
The American government was acting illegally.

1395
02:09:46,750 --> 02:09:51,086
I don't think he should be brought home without facing the music.

1396
02:09:51,250 --> 02:09:55,418
Snowden played a very important role in educating the American people

1397
02:09:55,586 --> 02:10:01,126
to the degree in which our civil liberties and 
our constitutional rights are being undermined.
