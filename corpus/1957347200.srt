Where is your brother?

You guys?

15
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:01,711
Anybody here?

00:01:01,745 --> 00:01:02,679

You've reached Tolbert!

20
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:13,423
Hi!

21
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:14,558
Go on and leave that message.

22
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:15,625
You know what to do.

23
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,394
Boop!
[beep]

24
00:01:17,427 --> 00:01:18,129
Hey, Tolbert.

25
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:19,729
Uh, It's Scott.

26
00:01:19,764 --> 00:01:22,399
Um, why did I come into
work today for nothing?

27
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,769
You told me that we were
working a private party?

28
00:01:24,802 --> 00:01:26,804
TOLBERT: Yeah, we are.

29
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:27,704
Surprise!

[music playing]

31
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,373
Hey!

32
00:01:30,407 --> 00:01:32,676
Bon voyage, buddy!

33
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:33,845
Oh, thanks, man.

34
00:01:33,878 --> 00:01:35,545
I don't leave for a week.

35
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:36,981
Yeah, I know, I know.

36
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,083
But tonight's the only night
the restaurant's closed.

37
00:01:39,116 --> 00:01:40,852
Scotty!

38
00:01:40,885 --> 00:01:42,686
My main man, we are going to
miss you around here, brother.

39
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,022
The place will not be
the same without you.

40
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:46,389
Wow, thank you.

41
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:47,457
That's... that's very
nice of you to...

42
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,525
- It'll be a lot better!
- Oh!

43
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:49,726
- MAN: [laughs]
- There it is.

44
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,627
Aw, kidding.

45
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,029
Kind of.

46
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:53,396
But seriously, bro, I hope
that you make a better

47
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,832
writer than you do a waiter.

48
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:56,633
All right, Tolbert,
this place better

49
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,568
be clean by opening tomorrow, or
you're doing doubles all week.

50
00:01:58,602 --> 00:01:59,971
Yep, yep.
Gotcha.

51
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:01,005
All right.

52
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,472
Uh, who are all these people?

53
00:02:02,505 --> 00:02:04,075
Oh, uh, these are
your friends, man.

54
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:06,710
Happy birthday, Mike!

55
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:08,478
Scott.

56
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:09,713
Yeah.

57
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:10,915
Look, you don't have
a lot of friends,

58
00:02:10,948 --> 00:02:12,549
so I had to improvise
a little bit.

59
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:13,650
You know?

60
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:14,785
All right.

61
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,620
I invited some of
my improv class.

62
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:17,889
She might know you.

63
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:18,856
But let's just get a drink.

64
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,157
OK.

65
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:21,092
Oh, yeah.

66
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:23,127
There we go!

67
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,929
Ah, wait.

68
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:28,766
To my best friend, who, uh, I
don't really understand why he

69
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:30,835
has to move to become
a writer, but I guess

70
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:32,036
it worked for Hemingway.

71
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,637
So bottoms up.

72
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,939
Actually, can we not
talk to Hemingway, though?

73
00:02:34,972 --> 00:02:38,742
Because he ended up
blowing his brains out.

74
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:40,177
I'mma Google that.

75
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:41,711
All right.

76
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,980
Look, look, here's to a
better ending than that.

77
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:43,948
- OK.
- OK?

78
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:44,916
Thank you.

79
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:48,518
Ooh!

80
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:49,519
Come on, one more.

81
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:51,155
Ooh, ooh.

82
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:52,123
Hold up.

83
00:02:55,927 --> 00:02:56,794
Hey, Dad.

84
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:58,095
Can I call you back?

85
00:02:58,129 --> 00:02:59,830
I'm actually... I'm at
a going away party.

86
00:02:59,864 --> 00:03:02,465
COOKIE (ON PHONE):
Scott, it's Cookie.

87
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:04,902
I'm using your father's phone.

88
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:09,106
I'm afraid your
father passed away.

89
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,573
What?

90
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,709
COOKIE (ON PHONE):
He died in his sleep.

91
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:14,477
I called the crematorium.

92
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:16,147
They're... they're coming in
two hours if you'd like to see

93
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,817
him before they take him away.

94
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:21,584
Daddy's dead?

95
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,954
COOKIE (ON PHONE): And
Scott, can... can you

96
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:24,121
pick up your sister on the way?

00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,996

[knocking]

99
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:43,274
Hi.
Is he still here?

100
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,809
Am I too late?

101
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:46,143
No, he's still in bed,
right where I found him.

102
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:48,745
OK.

103
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:49,947
Where's Cindy?

104
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:52,216
Uh, she stayed in the car.

105
00:04:46,804 --> 00:04:48,072
Drink warm water.

106
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:49,840
Let cookie massage her legs.

107
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:50,908
Avoid ice cubes.

108
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:51,842
Really?

109
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:53,144
They hurt his teeth.

110
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:54,311
His teeth?

111
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:55,678
The man's blood was
50% cholesterol.

112
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:56,881
He's worried about his teeth?

113
00:04:56,914 --> 00:04:58,282
You know your
father and medicine.

114
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:00,117
He thought if he saw a
doctor, they'd just find

115
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:01,318
more things wrong with him.

116
00:05:01,352 --> 00:05:03,087
Yeah, isn't that
kind of the point?

117
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,023
Uh, your father loved
that picture of her.

118
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:13,730
Well, uh, I hope you
don't mind, but I

119
00:05:13,764 --> 00:05:18,035
collected a few personal items
that I thought you should have.

120
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,870
So this is it, huh?

121
00:05:19,904 --> 00:05:21,839
A man's life reduced to
a 10 by 12 cardboard box.

122
00:05:21,872 --> 00:05:23,140
Oh, no.
That's not it.

123
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:24,208
Wait a minute.

124
00:05:26,944 --> 00:05:28,846
I also made you a
tuna fish sandwich.

125
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,400
Can you just take this?

126
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:50,633
Thank you.

127
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:03,347
Are you OK?

128
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,315
Mom made me a sandwich.

129
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:08,752
Yeah.

130
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:11,288
Yeah, me, too.

131
00:06:11,322 --> 00:06:12,923
She's big on the sandwiches.

132
00:06:12,957 --> 00:06:14,358
Although Cookie's not
your mom, you know.

133
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:16,160
She's... she's Dad's wife.

134
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:20,663
Or she's Dad's
widow now, I guess.

135
00:06:20,697 --> 00:06:21,799
But you have a mom, right?

136
00:06:21,832 --> 00:06:22,900
So just don't ever
forget that, OK?

137
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:23,834
You're right.

138
00:06:23,868 --> 00:06:25,735
I'm sorry.

139
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:27,737
I mean, after everything
that Mom did for you,

140
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:29,340
can you just please not
call Cookie Mom ever again?

141
00:06:29,373 --> 00:06:30,808
All right!
I said I'm sorry!

142
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:41,684
[beeping]

143
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:46,423
[music playing]

144
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:54,231
We need to make a memorial card.

145
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:55,432
What?

146
00:06:55,466 --> 00:06:56,800
A memorial card...
you can write it,

147
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:59,236
and I can draw a picture.

148
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,237
A memorial card?

149
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:01,205
Who are we going to send...

150
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:09,880
Yes, OK.

151
00:07:09,914 --> 00:07:11,348
That's a good idea.
Let's make a memorial card.

152
00:07:11,382 --> 00:07:13,184
Yeah, you can write it,
and I can draw a picture.

153
00:07:13,217 --> 00:07:14,151
OK, sure.

154
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,060
CINDY WEAVER: My neighbor
watches TV so loud all night.

155
00:07:23,093 --> 00:07:25,229
I have to wear earplugs.

156
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:28,132
And when I complain,
she screams at me.

157
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:31,468
And she drinks a lot.

158
00:07:31,502 --> 00:07:34,338
SCOTT WEAVER: I'm
sorry to hear it.

159
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:36,006
What do you think I should do?

160
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,076
I don't know, get
bigger earplugs?

161
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:39,977
No, you're right.

162
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,745
I should just ignore it.

163
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,515
Do you want my sandwich?

164
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,517
I don't like tuna fish.

165
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,484
Me, neither.

166
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:54,458
I hope Cookie doesn't put
Dad's ashes in one of these.

167
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:07,137
I really just...

168
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:08,839
I can't believe that Dad
wanted to be cremated.

169
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:10,207
Why not?

170
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:14,345
He never struck me as
a cremation type of guy.

171
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:16,847
What would you do instead?

172
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,285
I would have a burial like
a normal person in a box

173
00:08:21,318 --> 00:08:23,487
with a funeral in the ground.

174
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,955
[snoring]

175
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:29,426
I'm sorry if that's
old school for you.

176
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,228
OK, I get it.

177
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:32,830
That's so boring!

178
00:08:32,863 --> 00:08:36,467
OK, what would you like
to do when you die, then?

179
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,135
I don't know.

180
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:42,573
I read about this thing where
they can take your ashes

181
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,142
and turn them into a diamond.

182
00:08:45,175 --> 00:08:47,311
A diamond?

183
00:08:47,344 --> 00:08:49,546
A diamond.

184
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:52,983
So you'd like to be
turned into a diamond?

185
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:55,552
It beats being stuck in
a box for all eternity.

186
00:08:55,586 --> 00:08:57,454
OK, so... well, then what
happens to the diamond, then?

187
00:08:57,488 --> 00:08:58,389
Who gets that?

188
00:08:58,422 --> 00:08:59,823
I don't know.

189
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:02,192
If I give it to you,
would you pawn me?

190
00:09:02,226 --> 00:09:03,127
The joke's on you...

191
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,028
I won't even be here.

192
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:04,995
I'll be in Paris.

193
00:09:07,598 --> 00:09:08,532
Right.

194
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:15,039
I mean, I'm going
to come and visit you.

195
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:15,839
Yeah.
Whatever!

196
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:32,823

Hey.

214
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:58,228
Hi.

215
00:12:58,262 --> 00:12:59,329
I'm so sorry I'm late.

216
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:00,264
Okie doke.

217
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:01,431
So I made you a file.

218
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:03,333
It's got pink slip,
repair history...

219
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:04,535
pretty much everything.

220
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:05,636
Do you have the check?

221
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:06,570
Oh!

222
00:13:06,603 --> 00:13:08,138
Right.

223
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:09,172
The car, dude.

224
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,741
Mm-hmm.

225
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:12,309
I actually called you, but
I think your voicemail's full

226
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:13,677
- or something.
- OK.

227
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,812
Well, no need to call.

228
00:13:14,846 --> 00:13:15,780
I'm here now.

229
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:17,247
So do you have the check?

230
00:13:17,281 --> 00:13:18,348
No, I... I was
trying to tell you

231
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:19,416
that I'm not buying the car.

232
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:23,654
Uh, what do you mean?

233
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:24,588
We had a deal.

234
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:26,323
Well, yeah.

235
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:28,158
B- but I asked my parents for
the money to buy your car,

236
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,763
and they said they'd rather just
give me their old car instead.

237
00:13:31,796 --> 00:13:32,864
Are you serious?

238
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:34,331
It's kind of crazy, you know?

239
00:13:34,364 --> 00:13:35,499
I got to drive around
a stupid minivan.

240
00:13:35,532 --> 00:13:36,700
It actually sucks.

241
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,836
Yeah, that definitely...

242
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,304
that definitely sucks.

243
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,441
Do you want a cone
for the trouble?

244
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:51,248
Yes, I want a cone.

245
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:54,251
[music playing]

246
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,531
Cookie, I'm sort
of busy right now.

247
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:12,135
Is... what?

248
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:14,237
She did what?

249
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,272
I don't know why you're here.

250
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:16,607
I told them to tell Cookie.

251
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,376
Yeah, well, Cookie's
pruning fig trees.

252
00:14:19,409 --> 00:14:20,477
She's doing what?

253
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,280
Hello, Cindy.

254
00:14:23,313 --> 00:14:24,181
And you are?

255
00:14:24,214 --> 00:14:26,818
He's my little brother.

256
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:28,585
What happened?

257
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:30,687
Well, your sister's having
a problem with a tenant here...

258
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:32,389
- Margaret.
- She hit me!

259
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:33,690
DOCTOR: Hold on a minute, Cindy.

260
00:14:33,724 --> 00:14:35,793
I... she... I told her
to turn down her TV,

261
00:14:35,827 --> 00:14:36,861
and she attacked me!

262
00:14:36,894 --> 00:14:37,762
I told you about her.

263
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,196
Everyone here is crazy!

264
00:14:39,229 --> 00:14:40,330
We're not sure how it started.

265
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:42,265
She pulled out my hair!

266
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,501
DOCTOR: She claims that
Cindy came in her room...

267
00:14:44,534 --> 00:14:45,903
stole her TV...

268
00:14:45,937 --> 00:14:47,905
and then spit on her when
she tried to stop her.

269
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:49,473
- You spit at her?
- She's a liar.

270
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:51,208
That was my TV.

271
00:14:51,241 --> 00:14:52,743
Trouble's been brewing between
them for quite some time.

272
00:14:52,777 --> 00:14:54,177
You know what?

273
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:55,712
She's just jealous,
because she wants

274
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:58,181
to steal my boyfriend,
DeMarco, and he won't

275
00:14:58,215 --> 00:14:59,216
have anything to do with her.

276
00:14:59,249 --> 00:15:00,617
OK, OK.

277
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:02,486
So, um, you have to
separate them or something?

278
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:04,856
Normally, yes, but this
isn't the first infraction

279
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:06,891
Cindy's had here, and we have
a very strict three strikes

280
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:08,291
policy.

281
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,795
OK, so, um, what
strike is she on?

282
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:14,197
[sighs]

283
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:14,932
Really, Cindy?

284
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:16,700
It's not my fault!

285
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:18,770
I managed to secure
a room at a board

286
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:20,905
and care over in
Hammond, but they can't

287
00:15:20,938 --> 00:15:22,205
take your sister for two weeks.

288
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:23,240
Hammond.

289
00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:23,941
I don't want to go to Hammond.

290
00:15:23,975 --> 00:15:25,509
I grew up in Hammond.

291
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:27,744
DOCTOR: Well, then you'll
feel right at home.

292
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:31,849
You can come back later and pick
up the rest of Cindy's things.

293
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:33,450
I... sorry, what
do you mean later?

294
00:15:33,483 --> 00:15:34,919
I thought that she wasn't
moving for two weeks?

295
00:15:34,952 --> 00:15:36,386
DOCTOR: Not into
the board and care,

296
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,721
but she needs to leave
here immediately.

297
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:39,389
Oh, it's fine.
I'll just move in with DeMarco.

298
00:15:39,423 --> 00:15:40,892
He's been wanting us to
live together for a while

299
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:41,859
now, anyway.

300
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:46,363
We've made a list of
all her medications.

301
00:15:46,396 --> 00:15:49,000
I hope I don't have to remind
you about how important it

302
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:50,902
is that she stays on them.

303
00:15:50,935 --> 00:15:52,402
[music playing]

304
00:15:52,436 --> 00:15:53,603
Sorry.
I'm sorry.

305
00:15:53,637 --> 00:15:55,238
Me?

306
00:15:55,272 --> 00:15:56,473
Uh, she... she's not... she's
not moving in with me.

307
00:15:56,506 --> 00:15:57,507
No, him... I'm not
moving in with him.

308
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:58,575
Well, she's not staying here.

309
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:00,845
She's already been dismissed.

310
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,647
OK, well, undismiss her.

311
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,582
You know, I face a lot of
hard choices at this facility,

312
00:16:05,615 --> 00:16:07,250
Mr. Weaver.

313
00:16:07,284 --> 00:16:10,520
But the only choice I have
right now for your sister

314
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:14,826
is to give her to you or to
put her out on the street.

315
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,001
Can I see how much I weigh?

316
00:16:24,035 --> 00:16:25,903
Let's go.

317
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:26,871
That wasn't my fault!

318
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:27,839
I didn't say that it was.

319
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:28,773
I'm going to sue them.

320
00:16:28,806 --> 00:16:30,007
Those people are evil!

321
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,475
- You can't sue them.
- Why not?

322
00:16:31,508 --> 00:16:32,509
Because you can't!

323
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:33,577
Well, just take me to a hotel.

324
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,745
I'll go to a hotel.

325
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:35,679
Oh, and who's going
to pay for that?

326
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:36,713
- Your boyfriend?
- Yeah!

327
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:37,681
DeMarco makes a ton of money.

328
00:16:37,714 --> 00:16:39,817
Way more than you do, I bet!

329
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:41,953
Yeah, well, most people do.

330
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,600
It's a little bit tight,
so just be careful with...

331
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:57,501
[bang]

332
00:16:57,534 --> 00:16:58,502
...the door.

333
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:09,613
This is it.

334
00:17:09,646 --> 00:17:11,849
Um, the bathroom is back
there if you need it.

335
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:13,416
But please, if you're
going to use a towel,

336
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,718
just pick one and reuse it, OK?

337
00:17:14,752 --> 00:17:16,653
Don't start using all of them.

338
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:18,055
Also, don't put your
stuff everywhere,

339
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:19,422
because I'm actually...

340
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:20,524
I'm trying to pack.

341
00:17:20,557 --> 00:17:21,959
So.

342
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:23,560
That's... that's my
bedroom, actually,

343
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:25,963
so if you could just, um...

344
00:17:25,997 --> 00:17:26,898
just don't go in it.

345
00:17:30,802 --> 00:17:32,435
Where's my room?

346
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,404
Um, right here.

347
00:17:34,437 --> 00:17:35,605
I have some sheets
and stuff for you,

348
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:36,874
I think somewhere
in these boxes.

349
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:38,843
Uh, no.

350
00:17:38,876 --> 00:17:39,777
SCOTT WEAVER: No?

351
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:40,778
No.

352
00:17:40,812 --> 00:17:42,113
I need privacy for my yoga.

353
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:43,680
I have special
breathing exercises,

354
00:17:43,713 --> 00:17:44,882
and I need space to do that.

355
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,818
And I, I, I, I can't
do that in here.

356
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:51,688
OK.

357
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:52,857
Can we call Mom?

358
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:53,758
I want to call Mom.

359
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,691
SCOTT WEAVER: Mom?

360
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:55,993
Yeah.

361
00:17:56,027 --> 00:17:58,029
Mom can't really do
anything about it, OK?

362
00:17:58,062 --> 00:17:59,529
She can't do anything anymore.

363
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:08,471
No, this isn't going to work.

364
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,107
This really isn't going to work.

00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:11,508
SCOTT WEAVER: I don't like
it anymore than you do,

366
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:12,076
but we don't have
a choice, either.

00:18:42,173 --> 00:18:48,112
Hey, um, listen, uh, y-y-
you don't need me to fill

369
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:49,847
any prescriptions or
anything for you, do you?

370
00:18:49,881 --> 00:18:51,015
'Cause I can go down
to the pharmacy.

371
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:52,083
How dare you ask me that?

372
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:53,117
What?

373
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,051
That is none of your business!

374
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:55,186
SCOTT WEAVER: I'm sorry.

375
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,419
I can't stay here.
No, no, no!

I...
SCOTT WEAVER: OK.

377
00:18:57,654 --> 00:18:58,789
- I'm not staying here.
- OK, all right!

378
00:18:58,823 --> 00:18:59,924
- No, no, no, no, no!
- All right!

00:18:59,957 --> 00:19:00,992
- No, no, no, no!
- OK, OK, OK.

00:19:01,025 --> 00:19:01,759
How about this?
How about this?

381
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:02,626
Take my room.

382
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:03,693
OK?

383
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:04,762
Have my room.

384
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:05,930
How about that?

385
00:19:05,963 --> 00:19:07,999
I'll stay out here,
and you'll have

386
00:19:08,032 --> 00:19:10,768
all the room you need for...

392
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:06,723
Uh, I'm moving to
Paris in five days,

393
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:07,892
and my passport
still has not come.

394
00:20:07,925 --> 00:20:09,026
It was supposed
to be here by now.

395
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:13,530
Um, hey, yeah, I'm sorry.

396
00:20:13,563 --> 00:20:14,932
My sister actually did that.

397
00:20:14,966 --> 00:20:17,500
You can just... you can
knock a few bucks off, OK?

398
00:20:17,534 --> 00:20:18,668
Yes, uh, I understand that.

399
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:20,004
But it... but it
has not come yet.

400
00:20:20,037 --> 00:20:21,538
So what am I supposed to
do if it doesn't show?

401
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:26,077
An expeditor?

402
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,510
OK, how much would that cost me?

403
00:20:30,214 --> 00:20:31,715
Oh, $600?

404
00:20:31,748 --> 00:20:33,750

Hey.

You said it was clean.

You know, your sister
should have been more careful.

Yes, I... yes, I know.

00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:55,572
I'm sorry.

I can't do it, Cookie.

Can you please just take her?
It's two weeks.

You won't... you won't
even know she's there.

I'm sorry!

426
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:30,707
Scott, I've already decided
to move in with my son

427
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,043
and his new wife.

428
00:21:32,076 --> 00:21:34,045
I don't think they're
quite ready for Cindy.

429
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:35,346
All right.

430
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:36,313
Sorry about the wait.

431
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:44,155
And also, I'm so
sorry for your loss.

Now, let's get to the money.

father and Cookie...

...had a prenuptial agreement,
so she won't be a part

436
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:54,697
of these estate proceedings.

437
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:55,933
He made you sign a prenup?

438
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:59,103
Actually, I made him sign one.

439
00:21:59,136 --> 00:22:00,737
Your father was not
great with money.

440
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:03,307
The savings,
retirement, and holdings

441
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:09,080
should just about cover my fees,
which just leaves us the house.

442
00:22:09,113 --> 00:22:10,647
Yes.
OK, great.

443
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,614
How soon can we sell that?

444
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:12,316
That depends.

445
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:13,750
Uh, who's Cindy?

446
00:22:15,753 --> 00:22:16,619
Cindy.

447
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:17,822
What about her?

448
00:22:17,855 --> 00:22:19,622
LAWYER: Yes, well,
uh, the estate is

449
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:21,624
split evenly between you both.

450
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:23,027
So if you want to
sell the house,

451
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,864
you're going to need to
get her to sign off on it.

452
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:28,999
Oh, good Lord.

453
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:31,802
Uh, Cindy has
had some troubles.

Um, when she's off medication,
she's just as likely to sign

459

Um, I've given up guessing
what Cindy's going to do.

a chance, Scotty.

make sure I understand.

Sorry, one second.

00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,263
So when that's done, you
just ship my passport,

be there to sign, right?

Yes.

525
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:39,550
Yeah, Dad would want that.
But...

What if we want
the same thing?

I don't think that we will.

you know why dad

never wanted us to be together?

00:27:03,173 --> 00:27:07,177
Well, um, Dad
didn't really like

540

00:27:08,479 --> 00:27:09,380
Why?

Well, uh, he and Mom saw
things a little differently.

543
00:27:18,622 --> 00:27:22,393
And well, he thought I
always agreed with Mom.

544
00:27:22,426 --> 00:27:24,194
CINDY WEAVER:
About me, you mean?

545
00:27:35,005 --> 00:27:37,941
Yeah, about a lot of things.

546
00:27:37,975 --> 00:27:40,944

Scott.

548
00:28:19,183 --> 00:28:20,384
Scott.

549
00:28:20,417 --> 00:28:22,186
- Scott!
- What happened?

550
00:28:22,219 --> 00:28:23,620
I have to go to my
therapist, but it takes me

551
00:28:23,654 --> 00:28:24,555
three buses to get there.

552
00:28:24,588 --> 00:28:26,190
Can you please drive me?

553
00:28:26,223 --> 00:28:27,491
They get really mad
at you if you're late,

554
00:28:27,524 --> 00:28:28,459
so I can't be late.

555
00:28:28,492 --> 00:28:30,527
Can you drive me or not?

556
00:28:30,561 --> 00:28:32,362
Can you drive me or not?

557
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:33,765
Can you drive me or not!

558
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:35,466
Just... can you calm down
and give me one second?

559
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:41,071
Stop staring at me.

560
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:03,126
Oh!

561
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,094
About time.

562
00:29:04,127 --> 00:29:06,296
She wants to talk to you.

563
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,231
What?

564
00:29:07,264 --> 00:29:08,165
Who?

565
00:29:11,068 --> 00:29:12,804
[knocking]

566
00:29:12,837 --> 00:29:15,205
You must be Cindy's brother.

567
00:29:15,239 --> 00:29:17,007
Come on in, have a seat.

568
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:23,247
She talks about
you all the time.

569
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,816
She's very proud.

570
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:27,084
Really?

571
00:29:27,117 --> 00:29:29,787
That's news to me.

572
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:33,624
So you're moving
to Paris, I hear.

573
00:29:33,657 --> 00:29:34,826
Yes.

574
00:29:34,859 --> 00:29:38,228
Why, you want to buy my car?

575
00:29:38,262 --> 00:29:39,496
Cindy's nervous about it...

576
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,298
about you leaving.

577
00:29:41,331 --> 00:29:45,202
Oh, well, it's not like things
are going to be much different.

578
00:29:45,235 --> 00:29:47,404
I mean, we're not exactly close.

579
00:29:47,437 --> 00:29:49,841
And why do you think that is?

580
00:29:49,874 --> 00:29:51,608
Oh, gee, how much
time do you have?

581
00:29:51,642 --> 00:29:54,344
Well, we could discuss
it later today if you like.

582
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:55,345
Oh, no, no, no.

583
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:56,346
That's... that's... I didn't...

584
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,816
I... I was not...

585
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,317
sorry, I don't need therapy.

586
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,251
I'm, I'm not the one
that's hearing voices.

587
00:30:01,285 --> 00:30:02,386
So.

588
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:03,353
You think that's
the only reason

589
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:05,289
people talk to therapists?

590
00:30:05,322 --> 00:30:06,290
OK.

591
00:30:06,323 --> 00:30:07,190
Uh, thank you for the offer.

592
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:08,258
But I really should go.

593
00:30:08,292 --> 00:30:09,560
So.

594
00:30:09,593 --> 00:30:10,828
That's not actually
why I asked you in here.

595
00:30:10,862 --> 00:30:12,229
Your sister wants to get a job.

596
00:30:14,298 --> 00:30:15,232
Right.

597
00:30:18,402 --> 00:30:19,469
Oh my God, you're serious.

598
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:20,671
No, my s... my sister can't work.

599
00:30:20,704 --> 00:30:22,172
She thinks she can.

600
00:30:22,205 --> 00:30:23,307
OK, well, she also
thought that the mailman

601
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:24,374
was trying to kill her.

602
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:26,143
Well, I spoke to Cookie.

603
00:30:26,176 --> 00:30:27,411
- She agrees with me.
- Does she?

604
00:30:27,444 --> 00:30:28,579
THERAPIST: And Cindy
told me your father

605
00:30:28,612 --> 00:30:30,314
encouraged her to get a job?

606
00:30:30,347 --> 00:30:33,250
Oh, well, my father thought
that she was a drug addict.

607
00:30:33,283 --> 00:30:34,484
OK.

608
00:30:34,518 --> 00:30:36,119
Why don't you think
about it this way?

609
00:30:36,153 --> 00:30:37,688
You really want to
move to Paris and stop

610
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:39,423
worrying about your sister?

611
00:30:39,456 --> 00:30:41,793
Help her get a job so she can
stand on her own two feet.

612
00:30:45,329 --> 00:30:47,197
Are you guilt tripping me?

[music - mia dyson, "fool"]

614
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:50,267

guilt trip people.

00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,903
Mmm.

00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:58,241
(SINGING) I tell myself
not to be a fool.

617
00:30:58,275 --> 00:31:01,345
It comes so naturally to me.

618
00:31:01,378 --> 00:31:04,681
It's all I'll ever be.

619
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:10,487
I tell myself to grow
up and get serious.

620
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:15,525
And all I want to be is
an animal that's free.

not safe in my head.

- Stop it.
- What?

00:31:39,917 --> 00:31:41,151
I'm not doing anything.

I don't see why
I can't just work

So as we were talking
about over the phone,

638
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:14,718
basically the job is
just sweeping up hair

639
00:32:14,751 --> 00:32:17,354
and generally helping out with
whatever the hairdressers need.

640

That's very doable.

You can sweep.

00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:21,458

00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:22,659

ready to pitch in.

you could use her help.

are in the morning, so
we'll need you here at 8:00.

Oh, no, I can't do
that, 'cause I have yoga.

Yes, you said that.

656
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:45,415
But I'm sure that you
could move your yoga...

work, 'cause I have yoga!

Yes, uh, coffee.

00:33:17,614 --> 00:33:19,349
Uh, I don't drink it,
of course... too strong.

So, um, I don't have any
doctors, though, because...

Well, that's well...
I'm so sorry.

672
00:33:30,061 --> 00:33:31,763
Please, excuse me.
I'm so sorry.

just a couple of doctors.

do you think I am?

720
00:34:55,947 --> 00:34:56,814
Oh.

721
00:34:56,848 --> 00:34:58,448
Oh, you're serious.

722
00:34:58,481 --> 00:34:59,516

723
00:34:59,549 --> 00:35:01,152

leave your sister here!

725

I'm just...

726
00:35:05,857 --> 00:35:07,490
I'm... she doesn't
have anything, man.

727
00:35:07,524 --> 00:35:09,526
OK, I'm trying to help her
a little bit before I go!

728
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,494
You're the one who said
she could never work!

729
00:35:11,528 --> 00:35:13,663
Yeah, I also said that I
had the idea for "Mario Kart."

730
00:35:13,697 --> 00:35:14,765
You didn't believe
that, did you?

731
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:16,433
I considered it!

732
00:35:16,466 --> 00:35:18,970
OK, look, just please
watch out for her, all right?

733
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:20,704
Just give her a little
encouragement now and then,

734
00:35:20,737 --> 00:35:21,973
and that's it.

735
00:35:22,006 --> 00:35:24,108
If she runs a car
through that window...

736
00:35:24,141 --> 00:35:27,510
She's not going to run
a car though the window.

737
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:28,846
Probably.

738
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,182
Oh my...

739
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:34,517
Yeah, she... she's good to go.

740
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:36,120
She can pick up some
dishes or something.

741
00:35:36,153 --> 00:35:37,054
You think?

742
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:39,689
Yeah!

can put [inaudible] now.

Calm down.

It's not that big a deal.

749
00:35:47,932 --> 00:35:48,766
- It's just got a job.
- Not that big a deal?

Are you kidding me?

751
00:35:49,767 --> 00:35:51,434
Scotty, it's my first job!

752
00:35:51,468 --> 00:35:53,637
And all because of you.

753
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,972
Thank you.

OK, I'm going to take us
out for ice cream now.

755
00:35:56,107 --> 00:35:56,974
Oh, are you?

756
00:35:57,008 --> 00:35:58,475
Yeah, I'm buying.

757
00:35:58,508 --> 00:35:59,743

have any money, though.

God, this is such a relief!

766
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,977
I was so stressed out
during those interviews.

767
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:35,478
I thought that I
would never get a job.

768
00:36:35,512 --> 00:36:36,680

have to worry anymore,

And I'm sure you'll
do a really good job.

00:36:41,786 --> 00:36:42,753
Yeah.

774
00:36:42,787 --> 00:36:44,155
I really, really do hope so.

775
00:36:44,188 --> 00:36:48,793
Things have just... they
have not been easy lately.

776
00:36:48,826 --> 00:36:51,695
Like, I was going
to this yoga class,

777
00:36:51,728 --> 00:36:52,930
and I was making
lots of friends.

778
00:36:52,964 --> 00:36:54,531
Mm-hmm.

779
00:36:54,564 --> 00:36:57,101
Um, but then I didn't
really know how to, like,

780
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:59,971
tell them about my situation.

781
00:37:00,004 --> 00:37:01,172
Why did you have to?

782
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:02,173
No, no!
I know!

783
00:37:02,206 --> 00:37:03,107
Right?

784
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,041
Why did I have to?

785
00:37:04,075 --> 00:37:05,276
Mmm.

786
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:06,978
But my therapist
said that I should.

787
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:10,047
Um, that was scary, because
these were normal people,

788
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:11,882
and they didn't know about me.

789
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:17,755
And so, um, I told them about
the medication and about the

790
00:37:17,788 --> 00:37:20,057
doctors and about the illness.

791
00:37:20,091 --> 00:37:23,761
And, um, then everyone
stopped talking to me,

792
00:37:23,794 --> 00:37:25,495
so I stopped going to yoga.

793
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:36,040
You know, like, you don't have
to tell people anything, right?

794
00:37:36,073 --> 00:37:39,877
I mean, for me, like, our
past and Mom and Dad...

795
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,145
all that stuff...

796
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:42,279
I really don't tell
people any of that.

797
00:37:42,313 --> 00:37:45,582
It's... it's none
of their business.

798
00:37:45,615 --> 00:37:46,917
You don't?

799
00:37:46,951 --> 00:37:49,719
No.

800
00:37:49,754 --> 00:37:50,888
But then how do
you make friends?

801
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,294
Enough about me, OK?

00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:29,126
I do?

It's been... I haven't seen
you since high school!

830
00:38:36,934 --> 00:38:38,135
Yeah.

831
00:38:38,169 --> 00:38:39,602
And Scotty... the
last time I saw you,

832
00:38:39,636 --> 00:38:40,938
you weren't even shaving.

833
00:38:40,971 --> 00:38:42,739
Yeah, well, that's...
there's puberty for you.

834
00:38:42,773 --> 00:38:43,974
- It's...
- Aw!

00:38:44,008 --> 00:38:46,077
So, um, what are
you doing here?

836
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,311
I heard that you
moved to LA, no?

837
00:38:47,344 --> 00:38:48,711
Oh, yeah.

838
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:50,613
Um, I just keep a
little house here,

839
00:38:50,647 --> 00:38:51,782

844
00:38:56,854 --> 00:38:57,822

845
00:38:57,855 --> 00:38:58,721

846
00:38:58,756 --> 00:38:59,757
I just got a job!

847
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,690
Oh my God!

848
00:39:00,723 --> 00:39:01,759
Me, too!

849
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:02,793
Yeah!

850
00:39:02,827 --> 00:39:04,661
Um, Cindy was the real actress.

851
00:39:04,694 --> 00:39:06,330
Tell me you're still acting.

852
00:39:06,363 --> 00:39:08,065
She was so talented.

853
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:09,300
I was just her understudy.

854
00:39:09,333 --> 00:39:10,633
So what's the jump?

855
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:12,236
Uh, I'm a busboy.

856
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:14,671

857
00:39:14,704 --> 00:39:16,739
No, in a restaurant
with my brother.

858
00:39:21,779 --> 00:39:23,881

town for a couple of days

866
00:39:36,093 --> 00:39:37,895
before I fly back
to LA to shoot it,

867
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:41,298
and then I have to go to Morocco
for one episode, I think.

868
00:39:41,332 --> 00:39:42,900
But ugh!
You know how it is.

869
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:44,301
I'm jet-lagged just
thinking about it.

870
00:39:44,335 --> 00:39:46,203
Oh, that sounds so rough!

871
00:39:46,237 --> 00:39:47,704
Ugh!

872
00:39:47,737 --> 00:39:48,738
We should go, Jules.

873
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:49,907
We have to get ready.

874
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,041

Mmm, mmm.

- No, no, that's very nice.
- OK?

881

You just have to!

882
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,087
But we actually... uh,
we have something right

883
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,687
after this that we're, um...

884
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:05,856
No, you can miss it.

- Prior engagement.

00:40:06,991 --> 00:40:07,424
You're coming.
Sorry, [inaudible].

Billy's going to be there.

889
00:40:10,427 --> 00:40:12,263
Oh, Bi... Billy's
going to be there?

890
00:40:12,296 --> 00:40:13,297
Yeah!

891
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,731
Do you still keep up with him?

892
00:40:14,765 --> 00:40:18,135
God, you two were
the hottest couple.

893
00:40:18,169 --> 00:40:20,337
I don't know why you
let that one get away.

894
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:21,772
You two want some ice cream?

895
00:40:21,805 --> 00:40:22,705
Ew!

896
00:40:22,739 --> 00:40:24,275
God, no!

897
00:40:24,308 --> 00:40:26,743
Um, I just saw you through
the window, so I had to pop in.

about your ice cream?

trying to tell me
it's all right,

912
00:41:23,167 --> 00:41:27,404
and I found out that all
of these little things

913
00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:29,139
will break your heart.

914
00:41:32,243 --> 00:41:37,147

and that's the way it goes.

CINDY WEAVER: What?

928
00:42:17,354 --> 00:42:19,456
Just because she asked
doesn't mean we have to go, OK?

She doesn't... she... she
doesn't even want you there.

We have to sign the papers
to... to sell the house, OK?

What, uh... what are you wearing?

00:42:57,528 --> 00:43:00,164
I like it.

00:43:00,197 --> 00:43:01,865
I don't like what
you're wearing, either.

I think it's that
one right there.

Look at that.

That's like a house out

I haven't seen them in ages.

is dead, and my mom, um...

Uh, no, she didn't.

She's just... she's got some
short term memory issues.

995
00:44:54,278 --> 00:44:55,712
No, she moved to
Florida so that she

996
00:44:55,746 --> 00:44:56,747
could get away from me.

997
00:44:56,781 --> 00:44:58,682
No, she didn't.

998
00:44:58,715 --> 00:45:01,652
She just... she moved away
because her husband wanted to.

Do you know where
the bathroom is?

1000
00:45:06,056 --> 00:45:08,392

Yeah.

she's not great at parties.

So.

00:45:24,274 --> 00:45:25,609
How have you been?

that... that you work

1010
00:45:27,711 --> 00:45:29,313

1011
00:45:29,346 --> 00:45:30,647
Oh, uh, actually, no.

1012
00:45:30,681 --> 00:45:34,017

to Paris in a few days

Oh, uh, well, I'm actually...

1020
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:46,430
OK, I'm toying with
the idea of... of using

1021
00:45:46,463 --> 00:45:48,131
the form of an epistolary
novel to explore the...

I really have.

1041

Because you just
don't listen to me.

me a little bit more,

going to want to leave.

1076
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,620
- Let's go.
- Stop it!

1077
00:48:23,654 --> 00:48:24,856
Please.

1078
00:48:24,889 --> 00:48:25,790
Come on!

1079
00:48:25,823 --> 00:48:26,723
[inaudible]

1080
00:48:26,758 --> 00:48:27,658
We need to go.

1081
00:48:27,691 --> 00:48:28,592
I don't want to go.

1082
00:48:28,625 --> 00:48:29,526
OK, well, we need to go.

1083
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:30,895
[inaudible]

1084
00:48:30,928 --> 00:48:31,829
Cindy!

1085
00:48:34,766 --> 00:48:36,600
Billy!

1086
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:38,368
I can't believe it!

1087
00:48:41,638 --> 00:48:42,639
Oh my God!

1088
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:43,808
Were you out there doing yoga?

1089
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:44,942
Yeah.

1090
00:48:44,976 --> 00:48:46,743
Have you, um, read
the Kama Sutra?

1091
00:48:46,778 --> 00:48:48,378
It's really good
for constipation.

1092
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:54,284
Where have you been?

1093
00:48:54,317 --> 00:48:55,719
You've disappeared
since high school.

1094
00:48:55,752 --> 00:48:58,422
I know, I know, I
know, I know, I know.

1095
00:48:58,455 --> 00:49:01,625
I know, I know, I know.

1096
00:49:05,495 --> 00:49:08,265
Um, so listen, I actually have
to pack, so we should just run.

1097
00:49:08,298 --> 00:49:09,266
Scotty!

1098
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:10,267
I didn't even see you there.

1099
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,268
You've grown up.

1100
00:49:11,301 --> 00:49:13,403
Oh, that's... I'm actually...

1101
00:49:13,437 --> 00:49:14,839
been here for quite a while.

1102
00:49:14,872 --> 00:49:16,339
Um, we should actually
head out, for real, though.

1103
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:17,507
No!
Already?

1104
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:18,608
Yeah, come on.
Stay, have a drink.

1105
00:49:18,642 --> 00:49:19,676
Oh, no!

1106
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:20,878
I'm not allowed to drink.

1107
00:49:20,912 --> 00:49:21,813
Why not?

1108
00:49:21,846 --> 00:49:23,513
What, are you in rehab?

1109
00:49:23,547 --> 00:49:27,350
Uh, well, yeah, I'm in rehab,
because I'm a drug addict.

1110
00:49:27,384 --> 00:49:29,419
No, you're not.

1111
00:49:29,453 --> 00:49:30,320
Uh, I'm...

1112
00:49:30,353 --> 00:49:31,488
I'm sorry.

1113
00:49:31,521 --> 00:49:33,390
I di... I appreciate
your honesty.

1114
00:49:33,423 --> 00:49:34,691
I really do.

1115
00:49:34,725 --> 00:49:38,796
I was... you know, I was
in rehab for a week.

1116
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,731
And I'm a schizophrenic,
and my name is Sheena.

1117
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:44,802
- [awkward laugh]
- Um, it's not.

1118
00:49:44,836 --> 00:49:46,403
We should... we
actually should go.

1119
00:49:46,436 --> 00:49:48,840
So if you could... or if
you want to say bye, or...

1120
00:49:51,508 --> 00:49:52,409
Oh.

1121
00:49:52,442 --> 00:49:54,377
You smell so good!

1122
00:49:54,411 --> 00:49:55,545
And your hair is so soft.

1123
00:49:55,579 --> 00:49:58,548
And you're prettier than me.

1124
00:49:58,582 --> 00:49:59,917
- OK, let's...
- Um...

1125
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:01,052
...have a hug.

1126
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:05,622
But you... you
are so beautiful.

1127
00:50:09,026 --> 00:50:10,494
Thanks.

1128
00:50:10,527 --> 00:50:14,464
You... you are, too.

1129
00:50:14,498 --> 00:50:15,833
- Mmm.
- Scotty?

1130
00:50:15,867 --> 00:50:17,034
[moans sensually]

1131
00:50:17,068 --> 00:50:18,069
- OK, well, that's...
- Oh!

1132
00:50:18,102 --> 00:50:19,469
Oh, oh!
Oh!

1133
00:50:19,503 --> 00:50:20,504
[inaudible]

1134
00:50:20,537 --> 00:50:21,005
That's... we should
probably get out of here.

1135
00:50:21,038 --> 00:50:21,839
Come on, let's go.

1136
00:50:25,742 --> 00:50:28,045
Are you on your meds, Cindy?

1137
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:29,814
- I don't have to talk to you.
- Are you on your meds?

1138
00:50:29,847 --> 00:50:30,848
- I don't have to talk to you.
- OK.

1139
00:50:30,882 --> 00:50:32,349
I don't have to talk to you!

1140
00:50:32,382 --> 00:50:33,650
God damn it, if you
are not, I swear to God.

1141
00:50:33,683 --> 00:50:34,852
Pull over!
I want to get out of the car.

1142
00:50:34,886 --> 00:50:35,820
We're going home.
Then you can get...

1143
00:50:35,853 --> 00:50:36,954
Pull over!

1144
00:50:36,988 --> 00:50:37,855
I just want to get
out of this car!

1145
00:50:37,889 --> 00:50:38,890
Oh my God!
Jeez!

1146
00:50:38,923 --> 00:50:40,323
- We are driving!
- Pull over!

1147
00:50:40,357 --> 00:50:41,491
SCOTT WEAVER: OK!
Give me one second!

1148
00:50:43,127 --> 00:50:44,862
Cindy, where the
hell are you going?

1149
00:50:44,896 --> 00:50:46,030
I've taken lots of buses.

1150
00:50:46,063 --> 00:50:47,765
I don't need you.

1151
00:50:47,799 --> 00:50:48,866
You're not my parent, and
you can't tell me what to do.

1152
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,101
I'm calling your therapist.

1153
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:51,668
She's my therapist,
and you can't call

1154
00:50:51,701 --> 00:50:52,736
her if I don't want you to!

1155
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:53,703
You're not Dad!

1156
00:50:53,737 --> 00:50:54,738
Yeah, I know I'm not Dad.

1157
00:50:54,772 --> 00:50:55,639
I'm trying to be your brother.

1158
00:50:55,672 --> 00:50:56,774
You're not my brother!

1159
00:50:56,808 --> 00:50:58,109
- You're not my brother!
- Uh-huh.

1160
00:50:58,142 --> 00:50:59,609
You don't care about me.
You don't call me.

1161
00:50:59,643 --> 00:51:00,744
- SCOTT WEAVER: [laughs]
- You don't see me.

1162
00:51:00,778 --> 00:51:02,046
You don't... you
don't do anything!

1163
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,014
I don't do anything?
Are you kidding me?

1164
00:51:03,047 --> 00:51:04,347
Are you kidding me?

1165
00:51:04,381 --> 00:51:05,715
Do you know what
I've done for you?

1166
00:51:05,749 --> 00:51:06,851
I've literally sacrificed
everything for you!

1167
00:51:06,884 --> 00:51:07,617
When have you done
anything for me?

1168
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:08,820
Huh?
Tell me!

1169
00:51:08,853 --> 00:51:09,954
When have you done
one thing for me?

1170
00:51:09,987 --> 00:51:11,022
You have a
perfect life, Scott!

1171
00:51:11,055 --> 00:51:12,089
- I have a perfect life?
- Yes!

1172
00:51:12,123 --> 00:51:13,390
- I have a perfect life?
- Yeah!

1173
00:51:13,423 --> 00:51:14,125
You got everything!

1174
00:51:14,158 --> 00:51:16,660
You have everything!

1175
00:51:16,693 --> 00:51:18,029
I have nothing, Cindy.
Do you understand?

1176
00:51:18,062 --> 00:51:19,462
It's always been all about you.

1177
00:51:19,496 --> 00:51:20,932
All about you, OK?

1178
00:51:20,965 --> 00:51:23,400
Poor Cindy got sick and didn't
get to be a star, right?

1179
00:51:23,433 --> 00:51:24,601
Right?

1180
00:51:24,634 --> 00:51:26,403
Did you know that
Mom... did you know

1181
00:51:26,436 --> 00:51:27,104
that Mom once hit me because I
forgot to take out the trash?

1182
00:51:27,138 --> 00:51:28,906
Did you know that?

1183
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,908
You were running around crazy,
and I got in trouble because I

1184
00:51:30,942 --> 00:51:32,609
didn't take out the trash.

1185
00:51:32,642 --> 00:51:33,845
It's really too bad that I
didn't go crazy, too, right?

1186
00:51:33,878 --> 00:51:34,644
Then I could've done
whatever I wanted.

1187
00:51:34,678 --> 00:51:35,679
Yeah!

1188
00:51:35,712 --> 00:51:36,746
What did you ever want to do?

1189
00:51:36,781 --> 00:51:38,015
What does that even mean?

1190
00:51:38,049 --> 00:51:39,482
All right, you want
to move to Paris so

1191
00:51:39,516 --> 00:51:40,617
- that you can become a writer?
- Yes.

1192
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:41,718
Because there's
no way that you

1193
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:43,486
could possibly do that here!

1194
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,822
We're not... no, no, we are
not talking about me right now,

1195
00:51:44,856 --> 00:51:45,722
Cindy.
OK?

1196
00:51:45,756 --> 00:51:47,490
You were normal, Scott!

1197
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:48,793
You could have done anything!

1198
00:51:48,826 --> 00:51:49,760
Anything!

1199
00:51:49,794 --> 00:51:50,895
You were just too scared!

1200
00:51:50,928 --> 00:51:51,863
Yeah!

1201
00:51:51,896 --> 00:51:53,396
You were just too scared!

1202
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:55,032
You, you... you just were
my little brother who

1203
00:51:55,066 --> 00:51:57,500
wet the bed until he was 14!

1204
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:58,602
That's... th... I was 11!

1205
00:51:58,635 --> 00:51:59,536
That's bullshit!

1206
00:51:59,569 --> 00:52:00,503
Can you... Cindy.

1207
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:01,438
Cindy, get back in the car.

1208
00:52:01,471 --> 00:52:02,173
Please?

1209
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:03,107
I'm going home.

1210
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,075
What?

1211
00:52:04,108 --> 00:52:05,442
Oh, you don't have a home.

1212
00:52:05,475 --> 00:52:06,576
Yes, I do.

1213
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:07,444
I'm going to live
at Dad's house.

1214
00:52:07,477 --> 00:52:08,645
The hell you are!

1215
00:52:08,678 --> 00:52:09,679
- We're selling that house.
- Oh, no!

1216
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:11,015
It's my house, too, remember?

1217
00:52:11,048 --> 00:52:11,916
- Dad said we're equal.
- Well, we're not equal.

1218
00:52:11,949 --> 00:52:12,817
Hey!

1219
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:14,919
We are not equal!

1220
00:52:14,952 --> 00:52:18,823
You know what the difference
is between you and me, Scotty?

1221
00:52:18,856 --> 00:52:20,423
At least I know I'm screwed up.

1222
00:52:23,127 --> 00:52:24,028
We're selling that house!

1223
00:52:24,061 --> 00:52:25,062
Do you hear me?

1224
00:52:25,096 --> 00:52:26,630
Do you hear me?

1225
00:52:26,663 --> 00:52:27,697
You better be at the
lawyers' tomorrow morning

1226
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:28,732
to sign the goddamn papers!

1227
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:35,006
[music playing]

1228
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:35,973
Shit!

1229
00:53:24,255 --> 00:53:25,957
Did she know
what time to come?

1230
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:43,274
Oh, shit!

1231
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:45,276
Where is it?

1232
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:46,210
Cindy!

1233
00:53:46,243 --> 00:53:47,979
Cindy!

1234
00:53:48,012 --> 00:53:48,946
I know that you're in there.

1235
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,881
Open the door!

1236
00:53:50,915 --> 00:53:52,016
God damn it, Cindy!

1237
00:53:52,049 --> 00:53:53,717
You can't do one
thing for me, huh?

1238
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,987
Not one!

1239
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:56,954
I want to sell the house!

1240
00:53:56,988 --> 00:53:58,555
Of course you don't, right?

1241
00:53:58,588 --> 00:54:00,091
You got to be the center
of the God damn universe!

1242
00:54:00,124 --> 00:54:02,159
It all has to be
about you, right?

1243
00:54:02,193 --> 00:54:04,028
[pounding]

1244
00:54:04,061 --> 00:54:04,996
Cindy!

1245
00:54:08,232 --> 00:54:09,166
Shit!

1246
00:54:12,003 --> 00:54:13,737
Scott, what are
you doing here?

1247
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:15,206
When's the last time
you talked to Cindy?

1248
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:17,141
Is she still on meds?

1249
00:54:17,174 --> 00:54:18,742
- Scott, what happened?
- Oh, what happened?

1250
00:54:18,776 --> 00:54:19,977
It's the same thing
that always happens.

1251
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:21,112
She ruins everything in my life.

1252
00:54:28,986 --> 00:54:32,123
Your sister didn't
ruin your life.

1253
00:54:32,156 --> 00:54:33,057
Her illness did.

1254
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:34,225
Yeah, same thing.

1255
00:54:34,258 --> 00:54:35,558
Is it?

1256
00:54:35,592 --> 00:54:36,827
Is that all she is?

1257
00:54:36,861 --> 00:54:38,728
Just a schizophrenic.

1258
00:54:38,763 --> 00:54:40,865
Not a woman grieving her father?

1259
00:54:40,898 --> 00:54:43,234
Not a sister?

1260
00:54:43,267 --> 00:54:44,802
You think you're the
only one trying to find

1261
00:54:44,835 --> 00:54:45,936
your place in this world?

1262
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:46,837
OK, don't compare
the two of us.

1263
00:54:46,871 --> 00:54:47,670
OK?
We're not alike.

1264
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:50,107
No, you're not.

1265
00:54:50,141 --> 00:54:52,043
She said she lived in
her shadow as a child.

1266
00:54:56,613 --> 00:54:58,115
She said that?

1267
00:54:58,149 --> 00:54:59,749
She said when you
walked to school together,

1268
00:54:59,784 --> 00:55:03,754
everyone would run up to
her and you'd be forgotten.

1269
00:55:03,788 --> 00:55:07,258
No, that's... no, I had...

1270
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:08,591
I had friends.

1271
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:10,294
Let me see if
this rings a bell.

1272
00:55:10,327 --> 00:55:13,064
You always felt like you didn't
matter, because your parents

1273
00:55:13,097 --> 00:55:15,800
were constantly fighting.

1274
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:18,169
And you felt the same
way when Cindy got ill.

1275
00:55:21,671 --> 00:55:25,009
You made all the sacrifices...

1276
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:26,676
followed all the rules...

1277
00:55:26,709 --> 00:55:28,645
did whatever you could to
keep everyone else happy.

1278
00:55:28,678 --> 00:55:30,680
And no one even noticed.

1279
00:55:30,713 --> 00:55:32,817
There are people
you can talk to.

1280
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:34,285
Me... support groups
for families...

1281
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:35,685
No, no!

1282
00:55:35,718 --> 00:55:36,887
THERAPIST: [inaudible]
schizophrenic.

1283
00:55:36,921 --> 00:55:37,822
I don't... I don't need...
I don't need a support group!

1284
00:55:37,855 --> 00:55:39,023
OK?

1285
00:55:39,056 --> 00:55:39,890
I don't need... I
don't need medication,

1286
00:55:39,924 --> 00:55:40,524
and I don't need a shrink.

1287
00:55:40,558 --> 00:55:41,358
I just... I need to leave!

1288
00:55:41,392 --> 00:55:42,725
OK?

1289
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:48,933
[music playing]

1290
00:58:12,509 --> 00:58:13,911
Ew.
Watch your step.

1291
00:58:13,944 --> 00:58:15,045
Thank you.

1292
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:16,480
Can someone clean
this up please?

1293
00:58:16,513 --> 00:58:18,849
So, um, have you
seen Cindy recently?

1294
00:58:18,882 --> 00:58:20,184
Do you have any idea
where she might be?

1295
00:58:20,217 --> 00:58:21,118
No.

1296
00:58:24,888 --> 00:58:28,025
Did your sister ever tell
you about the voices?

1297
00:58:28,058 --> 00:58:29,860
Um, I...

1298
00:58:29,893 --> 00:58:32,263
I never really asked.

1299
00:58:32,296 --> 00:58:36,200
Well, the meds don't
get rid of the voices.

1300
00:58:36,233 --> 00:58:38,302
They just lower the volume.

1301
00:58:38,335 --> 00:58:40,437
The voices are always there.

1302
00:58:40,471 --> 00:58:42,306
And they're mean,
and they're nasty.

1303
00:58:42,339 --> 00:58:44,375
And they're waiting to take
over, because they know

1304
00:58:44,408 --> 00:58:46,944
eventually the
person will just feel

1305
00:58:46,977 --> 00:58:50,547
so tired of feeling weak
and vulnerable they'll want

1306
00:58:50,581 --> 00:58:53,250
the voices to take control.

1307
00:58:53,284 --> 00:58:56,086
That's why they go off the meds.

1308
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,788
Because the voices make
them feel powerful.

1309
00:59:00,224 --> 00:59:02,326
Um, uh... what about
her boyfriend, DeMarco?

1310
00:59:02,359 --> 00:59:03,961
Maybe he knows where she went?

1311
00:59:03,994 --> 00:59:04,862
Who?

1312
00:59:04,895 --> 00:59:06,397
DeMarco, her boyfriend.

1313
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:10,134
Oh, right.

1314
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:13,003
DeMarco's not real.

1315
00:59:13,037 --> 00:59:13,937
What?

1316
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:14,872
No, no, no.

1317
00:59:14,905 --> 00:59:17,174
She... she said that...

1318
00:59:17,207 --> 00:59:18,475
that the two of them...

1319
00:59:18,509 --> 00:59:20,210
Your sister's very sick.

Uh, yeah, she has
to be missing 24 hours

1326
01:00:34,184 --> 01:00:36,019
before you can file a claim.

1327
01:00:36,053 --> 01:00:37,388
Yes, yes.

1328
01:00:37,421 --> 01:00:40,023
I know that, but she
could be dead in 24 hours.

1329
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:43,293
Is she a drug addict?

1330
01:00:43,327 --> 01:00:44,661
Would that help?

anyone see her anywhere?

Ugh.

1336
01:01:11,155 --> 01:01:14,158
No, and it was her shift.

Look, man, I...

01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:18,095
I want to help you
out, but I don't think

1339

it's going to work with her.

I just got a call
from Cindy, or Sheena?

01:01:28,172 --> 01:01:29,406
- As she's calling herself?
- Wait, wait.

1345
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,307
You talked to her?

1346
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:31,408
Where is she?

And there?
It's Scotty, OK?

1352
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:05,075
It's your brother.

I'm glad you're here.

Did you see them?

1362
01:02:19,556 --> 01:02:22,392
They're following me.

No, Cindy.

1370

There's nobody out there.

Shhh!

1373
01:02:38,141 --> 01:02:39,443
I told Cookie.

1374
01:02:39,476 --> 01:02:40,544
She's sending money so
that she can help us.

1375
01:02:40,577 --> 01:02:41,478
OK.

No, I don't.

You know that I'm leaving
in two days, right?

You know that.

let me take you to the hospital

come with me for one second?

Stop.
Please stop.

OK?
Please!

I'm leaving, right?
You know, right?

I'm sorry.

1407

It makes me a... just a terrible
brother, but I'm leaving, OK?

I'm leaving, and you need
to go to the hospital now.

let me take you to the hospital?

01:04:13,337 --> 01:04:14,204
Cindy, stop!

1429
01:04:14,237 --> 01:04:15,572
I don't know who he is!

1430
01:04:15,606 --> 01:04:16,774
- SCOTT WEAVER: Cindy!
- I don't know who he is!

1431
01:04:16,808 --> 01:04:17,708
Cindy!

1432
01:04:17,741 --> 01:04:18,642
I don't want to die!

1433
01:04:18,675 --> 01:04:20,177
I don't want to die!

1434
01:04:20,210 --> 01:04:22,379
Stop, Cindy!

1435
01:04:22,412 --> 01:04:23,815
Stop!
Get up, please!

1436
01:04:23,848 --> 01:04:25,515
She's my sister, OK?
And she's sick!

1437
01:04:25,549 --> 01:04:26,750
- Call the police!
- Please!

1438
01:04:26,784 --> 01:04:27,819
No, no, no!
You don't understand!

1439
01:04:27,852 --> 01:04:29,186
Cindy!

1440
01:04:29,219 --> 01:04:30,888
Cindy!

1441
01:04:30,922 --> 01:04:34,124
[music playing]

1442
01:05:19,703 --> 01:05:22,706
[phone ringing]

1443
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:23,674
TOMMY (ON PHONE): Hello?

1444
01:05:23,707 --> 01:05:24,574
Hi, Tommy.

1445
01:05:24,608 --> 01:05:25,575
Um, it's Scott.

1446
01:05:25,609 --> 01:05:27,577
Is my mom there?

1447
01:05:27,611 --> 01:05:28,780
TOMMY (ON PHONE): Uh, yeah.

1448
01:05:28,813 --> 01:05:30,547
You shouldn't be calling.

1449
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:33,316
It just upsets her.

1450
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:34,351
OK, well, did Cookie call you?

1451
01:05:34,384 --> 01:05:35,719
Did she tell you about my dad?

1452
01:05:35,752 --> 01:05:37,320
TOMMY (ON PHONE): Yes.

1453
01:05:37,354 --> 01:05:39,289
I told your mom, but I
don't know how much of it

1454
01:05:39,322 --> 01:05:40,257
got through.

1455
01:05:43,427 --> 01:05:44,962
OK, can you just put her on?

1456
01:05:44,996 --> 01:05:47,597
TOMMY (ON PHONE): Look, her
dementia only gets worse when

1457
01:05:47,631 --> 01:05:49,366
you call and stress her out.
I don't...

1458
01:05:49,399 --> 01:05:51,334
OK, can you just put her on
the phone, for Christ's sake?

1459
01:05:51,368 --> 01:05:52,703
I just need to talk
to my mom, all right?

1460
01:05:52,736 --> 01:05:56,306
TOMMY (ON PHONE):
[inaudible] It's Scotty.

1461
01:05:56,339 --> 01:05:59,476
MOM (ON PHONE):
Sweetheart, is that you?

1462
01:05:59,509 --> 01:06:00,912
Yes.
Hi.

1463
01:06:00,945 --> 01:06:01,846
Uh, hi, Mom.

1464
01:06:01,879 --> 01:06:03,246
It's Scotty.

1465
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,481
MOM (ON PHONE): Ugh!

1466
01:06:04,514 --> 01:06:06,550
Are you... [giggles]
are you in Paris?

1467
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:07,484
No.

1468
01:06:07,517 --> 01:06:09,553
Um, no.

1469
01:06:09,586 --> 01:06:11,388
Uh, not for a few
more days, Mom.

1470
01:06:11,421 --> 01:06:12,556
MOM (ON PHONE): Ah!

1471
01:06:12,589 --> 01:06:14,291
How is everything?

1472
01:06:14,324 --> 01:06:15,225
How's your sister?

1473
01:06:17,762 --> 01:06:24,802
Um, uh, Mom,
she's off her meds.

1474
01:06:24,836 --> 01:06:26,771
MOM (ON PHONE): Oh.

1475
01:06:26,804 --> 01:06:29,406
When?

1476
01:06:29,439 --> 01:06:30,307
I don't know.

1477
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:32,309
Um, I... I tried...

1478
01:06:32,342 --> 01:06:33,577
I tried to take her
to the hospital.

1479
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:36,313
But she ran.

1480
01:06:36,346 --> 01:06:37,247
MOM (ON PHONE): Mmm.

1481
01:06:41,786 --> 01:06:43,020
Mom, you there?

1482
01:06:43,054 --> 01:06:43,955
MOM (ON PHONE): Oh!

1483
01:06:43,988 --> 01:06:46,824
[weeps]

1484
01:06:48,358 --> 01:06:51,829
Mom, don't... don't cry, OK?

1485
01:06:51,863 --> 01:06:53,730
Um, they're going to...
they're going to find her,

1486
01:06:53,765 --> 01:06:55,332
because the police are
looking for her, OK?

1487
01:06:55,365 --> 01:06:56,399
So they're... don't worry.

1488
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:57,534
They're going to find her.

1489
01:06:57,567 --> 01:06:58,535
MOM (ON PHONE):
This is my fault!

1490
01:06:58,568 --> 01:07:00,337
This is all... all my fault!

1491
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:01,304
Nn-nnn.

1492
01:07:01,338 --> 01:07:02,073
No, don't blame yourself.

1493
01:07:02,106 --> 01:07:03,775
It's not your fault, OK?

1494
01:07:03,808 --> 01:07:05,609
This is not your fault, and
they're going to find her.

1495
01:07:05,642 --> 01:07:08,345
MOM (ON PHONE): Scotty,
she's my daughter!

1496
01:07:08,378 --> 01:07:14,919
She's sick, and I
can't take care of her!

1497
01:07:14,952 --> 01:07:16,353
(THROUGH TEARS) Um, I'm sorry.

1498
01:07:16,386 --> 01:07:19,090
What... uh... what do
you want me to do?

1499
01:07:19,123 --> 01:07:21,025
Just tell me... please
tell me what to do!

1500
01:07:21,058 --> 01:07:23,593
MOM (ON PHONE): Well,
you get on that plane!

1501
01:07:23,627 --> 01:07:25,462
That's what you do.

1502
01:07:25,495 --> 01:07:28,665
I'm not going to lose both
my kids to this monster!

1503
01:07:28,698 --> 01:07:29,967
- OK?
- Mm-hmm.

1504
01:07:30,001 --> 01:07:31,401
MOM (ON PHONE): Now,
you go to Paris.

1505
01:07:31,434 --> 01:07:32,870
OK?

1506
01:07:32,904 --> 01:07:33,938
You promise me you're getting
on that plane, Scotty.

1507
01:07:33,971 --> 01:07:34,839
- Promise me!
- Yes!

1508
01:07:34,872 --> 01:07:35,773
Yeah!

1509
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:37,041
I will.

1510
01:07:37,074 --> 01:07:38,708
MOM (ON PHONE): And
while you're at it,

1511
01:07:38,742 --> 01:07:41,012
you tell that worthless father
of yours to go find her!

1512
01:07:41,045 --> 01:07:44,081
That's his job, not yours.

1513
01:07:44,115 --> 01:07:45,917
OK?
OK?

1514
01:07:45,950 --> 01:07:46,851
T- tell him!

1515
01:07:46,884 --> 01:07:47,785
Yeah.

1516
01:07:47,819 --> 01:07:50,420
Um, yeah, I'll tell him.

1517
01:07:50,453 --> 01:07:51,621
MOM (ON PHONE): OK.

1518
01:07:51,655 --> 01:07:52,589
OK.

1519
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,726
Mom, you there?

1520
01:08:05,069 --> 01:08:08,039
[siren]

1521
01:08:09,639 --> 01:08:12,609
[music playing]

1522
01:08:31,963 --> 01:08:33,064
OFFICER: OK, Weaver.

1523
01:08:33,097 --> 01:08:34,131
Yes, yes!

1524
01:08:34,165 --> 01:08:35,833
Finally!

1525
01:08:35,867 --> 01:08:37,634
All right, you were look
looking for a Cindy Weaver,

1526
01:08:37,667 --> 01:08:38,535
right?

1527
01:08:38,568 --> 01:08:39,937
Yes.

1528
01:08:39,971 --> 01:08:42,907
All right, so here she
is located at a Travelodge

1529
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:44,141
- yesterday.
- No, no, no!

1530
01:08:44,175 --> 01:08:45,776
No, I know.
I know.

1531
01:08:45,810 --> 01:08:46,911
I was at the Travelodge.

1532
01:08:46,944 --> 01:08:47,845
That's... that's
not why I'm here.

1533
01:08:47,879 --> 01:08:49,579
OK.

1534
01:08:49,613 --> 01:08:50,447
So she's found, and I can
take her off the missing list.

1535
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:51,581
Oh.
No, no, no!

1536
01:08:51,615 --> 01:08:52,482
She's not... she's
not been found.

1537
01:08:52,515 --> 01:08:53,516
She's not been found.

1538
01:08:53,550 --> 01:08:54,718
She is still missing.
OK?

1539
01:08:54,751 --> 01:08:55,920
Please do not take
her off the list.

1540
01:08:55,953 --> 01:08:57,420
OK?

1541
01:08:57,454 --> 01:08:58,622
I am just here, because
I need to make sure

1542
01:08:58,655 --> 01:08:59,656
that her file's in
order, because I'm

1543
01:08:59,689 --> 01:09:01,125
leaving the country tomorrow.

1544
01:09:01,158 --> 01:09:01,893
Now, she's... she's listed
as a special circumstance,

1545
01:09:01,926 --> 01:09:03,660
is that correct?

1546
01:09:03,693 --> 01:09:04,561
She... they'll... they'll know
that she's mentally ill, right?

1547
01:09:04,594 --> 01:09:05,528
Not just a... a criminal.

1548
01:09:05,562 --> 01:09:07,098
Uh, yep, it's listed.

1549
01:09:07,131 --> 01:09:08,598
OK, good.

1550
01:09:08,632 --> 01:09:09,901
And that's not just
for this county, right?

1551
01:09:09,934 --> 01:09:10,902
They'll know if she
shows up somewhere else.

1552
01:09:10,935 --> 01:09:12,602
- We communicate.
- OK.

1553
01:09:12,636 --> 01:09:13,905
Um, and they'll... they'll...
they'll contact the person

1554
01:09:13,938 --> 01:09:15,605
that I put down there...
Cookie Weaver, right?

1555
01:09:15,639 --> 01:09:17,108
Because, see... I will...
I will not be here.

1556
01:09:17,141 --> 01:09:20,111
Look, we deal with
mentally ill patients

1557
01:09:20,144 --> 01:09:21,611
literally every day, sir.

1558
01:09:21,645 --> 01:09:22,813
Yes, maybe so, but
my sister really needs

1559
01:09:22,847 --> 01:09:24,048
to get back on medication.

1560
01:09:24,081 --> 01:09:26,050
Well, we'll do our
best to find her,

1561
01:09:26,083 --> 01:09:28,451
but we can't actually
make her take her meds.

1562
01:09:28,485 --> 01:09:30,054
OK, let me just tell you
something really quick.

1563
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:32,555
I've been around this illness
since I was 12 years old, OK?

1564
01:09:32,589 --> 01:09:34,959
I... I got my first pimple on
the way to a mental institution,

1565
01:09:34,992 --> 01:09:36,626
right?

1566
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,628
I saw my first naked boob
at a psychiatric hospital.

1567
01:09:38,662 --> 01:09:40,697
I met my first girlfriend my
sister's rehab center, OK?

1568
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:41,598
That has been my life.

1569
01:09:41,631 --> 01:09:42,934
So... so no!

1570
01:09:42,967 --> 01:09:44,101
No, Cindy does not get a choice.

1571
01:09:44,135 --> 01:09:45,102
You know why?

1572
01:09:45,136 --> 01:09:47,537
Because I... I never got one!

1573
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:50,540
[slow clapping]

1574
01:09:51,909 --> 01:09:53,911
This guy gets it.

1575
01:09:53,945 --> 01:09:55,645
Maybe she'll go home.

1576
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:57,514
Your father once said
whenever she was lost,

1577
01:09:57,547 --> 01:09:59,150
she always found
her way back home.

1578
01:09:59,183 --> 01:10:01,085
Yeah, she doesn't really
have a home anymore, so.

1579
01:10:03,821 --> 01:10:04,989
I'm sorry.

1580
01:10:05,022 --> 01:10:09,093
Cookie, I'm... I'm
leaving tomorrow.

1581
01:10:09,126 --> 01:10:11,062
I have to go.

1582
01:10:11,095 --> 01:10:12,696
I have to.

1583
01:10:12,729 --> 01:10:15,900
If... if don't, I just don't
think that I ever will.

1584
01:10:15,933 --> 01:10:17,868
So, um, I know you love Cindy.

1585
01:10:17,902 --> 01:10:19,103
I do.

1586
01:10:19,136 --> 01:10:20,537
Uh, so I'm...

1587
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:21,939
I'm going to pass
the baton onto you.

1588
01:10:21,973 --> 01:10:25,042
Now, listen... here is
all the names and numbers

1589
01:10:25,076 --> 01:10:26,676
of anyone that can help you.
I've written them down.

1590
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:27,812
OK?

1591
01:10:27,845 --> 01:10:29,146
There's the... the
police station.

1592
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,781
That's where I filed the
missing persons report.

1593
01:10:30,815 --> 01:10:32,116
There's the mobile health unit.

1594
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:34,785
I put my mom on there,
which, I mean, I don't...

1595
01:10:34,819 --> 01:10:37,288
obviously, I don't really
know how much help she can be.

1596
01:10:37,321 --> 01:10:39,090
Um, now, if... if
they do find her,

1597
01:10:39,123 --> 01:10:40,623
they can't force her
to go to the hospital,

1598
01:10:40,657 --> 01:10:43,094
so you have to keep trying.

1599
01:10:43,127 --> 01:10:45,562
Now, I'll be reachable

But... but the only thing
you have to think about...

1601
01:10:47,597 --> 01:10:48,933
really, the only
thing is getting

1602
01:10:48,966 --> 01:10:50,667
her back on the medication.

1603
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:51,969
OK?

That's the only thing
that really matters.

1606
01:10:54,205 --> 01:10:57,008
Uh, OK.

01:10:57,041 --> 01:10:58,976
I will.

01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:01,212
OK.

I am so sorry to bother you.

Um, my sister and I...

we used to live here.

1623
01:12:32,103 --> 01:12:34,271
Is there any chance you might
have seen a girl walking

1624
01:12:34,305 --> 01:12:36,673
around here looking just...

1625
01:12:36,706 --> 01:12:37,942

(SINGING) Don't I
look like my mother

when I've passed out
on our kitchen floor

1692
01:18:44,441 --> 01:18:47,478
from fighting drunk at the bar?

1693
01:18:55,486 --> 01:19:05,496
Don't I look like
my mother when I'm

1694
01:19:12,135 --> 01:19:16,473
jealous and insecure
and throwing

1695

holes through our bedroom door?

I never thought I'd be
cut from the same cloth.

But my eyes burn just like
hers when I'm messed up.

but ain't I my mother's girl?

And oh, I never thought I'd
be cut from the same cloth.

I'd learn, ooh.

SCOTT WEAVER: When you
get on an airplane,

1703
01:21:25,302 --> 01:21:27,304
they always tell you to
put on your own oxygen mask

1704
01:21:27,337 --> 01:21:31,174
first before helping others,
because you can't help anyone

1705

if you're drowning yourself.

1706
01:21:33,377 --> 01:21:36,580

him, as he waited patiently...

1708
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,920
But it was a point made
too late to matter.

His struggle was all in the past
now, along with his family...

alongside his expectations

01:21:49,827 --> 01:21:50,762
of himself.

01:21:52,897 --> 01:21:53,798

start, but thank you.

Am I going to be a character?

Um, there's a character
based on you, sort of.

was going to be a star.

01:22:27,631 --> 01:22:28,732
I feel so bloated.

- No.

You look fine.

though, with the voices?

No, you should go.

1735
01:22:56,928 --> 01:22:57,895
It's important that you go.

1736
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:08,672
I'm sorry.

1737
01:23:08,705 --> 01:23:12,676
I'm sorry that you didn't
get to go to Paris.

1738
01:23:12,709 --> 01:23:15,345
Well, it's been
around for 1,000 years,

1739
01:23:15,378 --> 01:23:19,851
so I think that it
can wait one more.

1740
01:23:19,884 --> 01:23:22,053
I hope you get there soon.

a car together?

How would that work?

1756
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:44,508
You would get the
first half of the week,

1757
01:23:44,541 --> 01:23:45,943
and I would get the
second half of the week.

1758
01:23:45,977 --> 01:23:48,478
OK, Cindy, you know that's
not going to work, OK?

1759

the pogo stick.

Mm-hmm.

made us throw it away.

Is that what happened to it?

Yeah, he threw it away!

I don't!

a piece of work.

01:24:51,142 --> 01:24:52,642
SCOTT WEAVER: Two more,
and then I'm good.

1781
01:24:52,676 --> 01:24:53,845
GROUP LEADER: All right.
You good to go?

1782
01:24:53,878 --> 01:24:54,744
Yes.

1783
01:24:54,779 --> 01:24:55,980
[interposing voices]

1784
01:24:56,013 --> 01:24:57,414
Let's do it.

1785
01:24:57,447 --> 01:24:58,415
COOKIE: Oh, wait,
I forgot the cream.

1786
01:24:58,448 --> 01:24:59,683
Thank you guys for helping.

1787
01:24:59,716 --> 01:25:00,684
I forgot the cream,
I forgot the cream!

1788
01:25:00,717 --> 01:25:01,418
I'm sorry.
OK, OK, OK.

1789
01:25:01,451 --> 01:25:03,020
Here we go.

1790
01:25:03,054 --> 01:25:04,155
- Can't do without the cream.
- Can't do without the cream.

1791
01:25:04,188 --> 01:25:04,922
SCOTT WEAVER: All
right, let's go.

1792
01:25:04,956 --> 01:25:05,689
Hey, everybody!

1793
01:25:05,722 --> 01:25:06,590
Watch you step.

1794
01:25:06,623 --> 01:25:07,624
I think we're all here.

1795
01:25:07,657 --> 01:25:09,026
All right.

1796
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:10,627
GROUP LEADER: A big thank
you to Scott for hosting

1797
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:11,661
the group meeting this week.

1798
01:25:11,695 --> 01:25:12,964
It's my deepest pleasure.

1799
01:25:12,997 --> 01:25:13,898
Here's some coffee.

1800
01:25:13,931 --> 01:25:14,832
Anybody need...

1801
01:25:14,866 --> 01:25:15,800
I got it, Scotty.

1802
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:16,767
Thank you, Cookie.

1803
01:25:19,436 --> 01:25:20,938
Cookies from cookie.

1804
01:25:20,972 --> 01:25:22,139
[laughter]

1805
01:25:22,173 --> 01:25:24,574
All right, who
wants to share first?

1806
01:25:27,477 --> 01:25:29,046
Scott?

1807
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:29,947
Yeah, OK.

1808
01:25:29,981 --> 01:25:31,816
Uh, sure.

1809
01:25:31,849 --> 01:25:33,150
Hello.

1810
01:25:33,184 --> 01:25:37,621
Um, for anybody that's
new, my name's Scott,

1811
01:25:37,654 --> 01:25:41,125
and my sister's schizophrenic.

1812
01:25:41,158 --> 01:25:47,198
Um, sorry, my
sister is my sister,

1813
01:25:47,231 --> 01:25:50,001
and she has schizophrenia.

1814
01:25:50,034 --> 01:25:53,871
And that is very
difficult at times, um,

1815
01:25:53,905 --> 01:25:57,141
as I'm sure you know.

1816
01:25:57,174 --> 01:25:58,675
Lately, it's been quite good.

1817
01:25:58,708 --> 01:26:00,845
She is in the hospital
at the moment, uh,

1818
01:26:00,878 --> 01:26:02,113
getting some really good care.

1819
01:26:02,146 --> 01:26:05,682
She's on a really
good meds regimen, um,

1820
01:26:05,715 --> 01:26:08,920
and things are
going pretty great.

1821
01:26:08,953 --> 01:26:11,688
I have absolutely
no idea if that

1822
01:26:11,721 --> 01:26:13,758
will be the case next week.

1823
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:17,762
But, um, today is
not too shabby.

1824
01:26:32,143 --> 01:26:35,146
[music playing]

1825
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:50,727
It takes, uh, a lot of... of...

1826
01:26:50,761 --> 01:26:52,997
a lot of education
to really begin

1827
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:54,899
to understand that we
have to differentiate

1828
01:26:54,932 --> 01:26:56,267
the person from the illness.

1829
01:26:56,300 --> 01:26:59,804
I am living with a
schizoaffective disorder...

1830
01:26:59,837 --> 01:27:03,074
have been for the past 16 years.

1831
01:27:03,107 --> 01:27:05,076
It's a challenge
when a... a person you

1832
01:27:05,109 --> 01:27:07,144
know is no longer that person.

1833
01:27:07,178 --> 01:27:10,247
To have them be who
you though we were...

1834
01:27:10,281 --> 01:27:12,515
and then suddenly their
face is different.

1835
01:27:12,549 --> 01:27:13,784
They look different.

1836
01:27:13,818 --> 01:27:15,585
They're... they're
saying things that you

1837
01:27:15,618 --> 01:27:16,753
wouldn't expect them to say.

1838
01:27:16,787 --> 01:27:18,588
And... and they're just...

1839
01:27:18,621 --> 01:27:20,791
and they're... they're
just not your mom anymore.

1840
01:27:20,825 --> 01:27:23,894
Our daughter, unfortunately,
does not accept her illness...

1841
01:27:23,928 --> 01:27:25,662
um, is fairly reclusive.

1842
01:27:25,695 --> 01:27:28,531
And... and it's been
interesting as a family, uh,

1843
01:27:28,565 --> 01:27:32,903
and a journey to
accept, uh, the illness.

1844
01:27:32,937 --> 01:27:34,738
In my brother's
situation... and this is

1845
01:27:34,772 --> 01:27:37,908
the situation for many...
he can't manage his own,

1846
01:27:37,942 --> 01:27:40,277
um, um, health care.

1847
01:27:40,311 --> 01:27:42,046
That's where I step in...

1848
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:46,117
is to be that liaison for him
between him and the doctors

1849
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:48,119
and understanding...
observing what's going on,

1850
01:27:48,152 --> 01:27:50,154
providing collateral
information,

1851
01:27:50,187 --> 01:27:53,723
and making sure that the
medication is working.

1852
01:27:53,758 --> 01:27:56,227
In the past 15
years, I've been on...

1853
01:27:56,260 --> 01:28:00,730
I've tried maybe a dozen
different medications.

1854
01:28:00,765 --> 01:28:05,702
Risperidone,
olanzapine, Seroquel,

1855
01:28:05,735 --> 01:28:09,940
Dilantin, [inaudible], Celexa.

1856
01:28:09,974 --> 01:28:12,243
You know, all these
crazy names, right?

1857
01:28:12,276 --> 01:28:15,312
There's definitely something
called caregiver burnout.

1858
01:28:15,346 --> 01:28:16,814
[laughter]

1859
01:28:16,847 --> 01:28:20,051
Uh, which, uh, impacted me.

1860
01:28:20,084 --> 01:28:23,287
I ended up developing
depression myself just

1861
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:24,754
from everything
going on with Mom

1862
01:28:24,789 --> 01:28:27,324
but spilling over
into everything else.

1863
01:28:27,358 --> 01:28:30,861
Uh, when my mom first
started becoming symptomatic,

1864
01:28:30,895 --> 01:28:32,196
I was planning a wedding.

1865
01:28:32,229 --> 01:28:33,764
Aw.

1866
01:28:33,798 --> 01:28:35,900
Uh, and I wasn't
sure if she was going

1867
01:28:35,933 --> 01:28:38,269
to be well enough to come.

1868
01:28:38,302 --> 01:28:42,206
The... the bond as a
family is enormously strong,

1869
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:43,841
and it amazes me...

1870
01:28:43,874 --> 01:28:47,644
even us going through what
we've gone through... how

1871
01:28:47,677 --> 01:28:49,113
strong that family bond is.

1872
01:28:49,146 --> 01:28:53,117
It doesn't go away come
hell or high water.

1873
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:56,954
It's important
to realize that 50%

1874
01:28:56,987 --> 01:29:00,157
of people with
schizophrenia have a symptom

1875
01:29:00,191 --> 01:29:02,359
called anosognosia, when...

1876
01:29:02,393 --> 01:29:04,862
where they don't realize
that they're ill.

1877
01:29:04,895 --> 01:29:08,165
So it often takes a third person
perspective... like a family

1878
01:29:08,199 --> 01:29:12,369
member or a doctor or a
school counselor... someone

1879
01:29:12,403 --> 01:29:16,407
with an objective perspective
and someone who can

1880
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:19,043
make that educated assessment.

1881
01:29:19,076 --> 01:29:21,212
Support groups... they've
become safe environments where

1882
01:29:21,245 --> 01:29:24,681
it's... it's nice to
people who, um, have

1883
01:29:24,714 --> 01:29:26,150
traveled a similar journey.

1884
01:29:26,183 --> 01:29:27,418
And so they understand.
[interposing voices]

1885
01:29:27,451 --> 01:29:28,352
Thank you so much.

1886
01:29:28,385 --> 01:29:29,286
You're welcome.

1887
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,788
Thank you.

1888
01:29:30,821 --> 01:29:33,858
The brain is unknown,
uncharted territory,

1889
01:29:33,891 --> 01:29:36,994
and of course there's
going to be stigma.

1890
01:29:37,027 --> 01:29:40,197
Because it's natural
to fear the unknown.

1891
01:29:40,231 --> 01:29:42,699
You guys are so generous
for taking the time.

1892

[interposing voices]

1893
01:29:43,968 --> 01:29:46,871
I couldn't possibly
have learned more.
