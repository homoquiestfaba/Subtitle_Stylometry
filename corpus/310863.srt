1
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,909
Sorry are you going towards uhh...

2
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,280
Hey.

3
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,269
Hi, Tim.

4
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,836
Jimmy! Oh my goodness.

5
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,956
Donald! Jimmy's here.

6
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,600
What?

7
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,999
It's Jim.

8
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,470
Come here, let mom look at you.

9
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,950
I'm pretty dehydrated. If you don't
mind, I'd like a glass a water. / Okay

10
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,430
What's all the stuff?

11
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,997
We sure did miss you
at Christmas, Jimmy.

12
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,680
You're back now

13
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,720
Oh. It's so good see you, Jim.

14
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,757
Mom misses you so much.

15
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,514
Jim? Are you okay?

16
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,152
Jimmy? Are you Okay?

17
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,759
What in the hell?

18
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,760
Jimmy's come
home to surprise us.

19
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,280
What's wrong with him?

20
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,680
He said he's dehydrated.

21
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,720
Dehydrated?

22
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,709
Well, get him some water.

23
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,233
Okay, okay.

24
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,670
Hi, Jimbo. How you been?

25
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,397
Here you go. Hon... Honey?

26
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,551
I brought you some clean towels.

27
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,392
Ok. Thanks

28
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,640
Lets see. Oh honey that cold.

29
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,232
Its fine mom, I'm fine.

30
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,040
Mom sure is happy to see you.

31
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,598
Yeah me too mom.

32
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,592
You call so little I worry about my
boy all alone in the big city.

33
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,280
I'm not a boy mom.

34
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,229
Yes you are. You are a pretty
boy. You are my pretty boy.

35
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,400
Something wrong, Dad?

36
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,280
No...

37
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,952
This food is great, Mom.

38
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,400
Nothing's wrong. I was just
thinking about your dogs.

39
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,560
My dogs?

40
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,880
Oh, that's what your mom told me
you were doing in New York.

41
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,080
Walking dogs.
Didn't you tell me that, Sally?

42
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,354
I think he does.

43
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,871
They don't need walking anymore?

44
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,472
I'm not planning on
going back to New York.

45
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,708
What are you planning?

46
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,390
I'm not sure.

47
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,080
Your Mom's short a guy in shipping.

48
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,548
Oh, he doesn't want to work with
his mother.

49
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,875
She's right.

50
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,633
What do you want?

51
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,195
Good-bye.

52
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:54,229
Bye, Tim. Just take your
time, Sweetie. You'll figure it out.

53
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,914
Not too much time.
The boy is nearly thirty.

54
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,037
He's 27, Donald.

55
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,152
Your mom and I started the business
when we were in our twenties.

56
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,673
I was eighteen, Donald.

57
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,710
There you are.

58
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,871
Where have you been?
Your mother was trying to call all day.

59
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,310
I was busy.

60
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,800
Oh. Well, I just wanted to invite
you to the girls' game.

61
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,200
What game?

62
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,040
Lts ok you can't win them all.
Go so Hi to your uncle Jimmy.

63
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,240
Hi, girls.

64
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,468
Hi, Uncle Jimmy.

65
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,200
What's wrong?

66
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,560
They lost again.

67
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,994
Their team hasn't scored a point yet.

68
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,513
Your brother's their coach.

69
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,875
What's the problem?

70
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,029
We suck.

71
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,960
Come here girls.
Grandma give you some ice cream.

72
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,157
You want Peanut Brickle or just
plain Vanilla?

73
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,797
Can I take the van?

74
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,396
Of course. You need some money?

75
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,716
Sure, I'll fill it up while I'm out.

76
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,389
Tanks full.

77
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,960
All right. Well, maybe I'll take a
little something anyway.

78
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,556
This is just the money I make
selling snacks at work.

79
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,310
Thanks.

80
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,994
No problem.

81
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,838
Hey... Jim? Jim Roush.

82
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,396
Hey

83
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,352
Hey, guys, look who it is.

84
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,435
Dick.

85
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,232
Can I have a Bud Light?

86
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:21,276
Hey, I was just curious...
What's with all the uniforms?

87
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,115
We're nurses.

88
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,678
Yeah. I lived across from a
hospital in Manhattan.

89
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,917
Manhattan, New York.

90
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,389
Ever been?

91
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,233
Yeah, its... /its alright...

92
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,035
What'd you do there?

93
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,999
Walked dogs. I mean that's what I
did for money. I also write.

94
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,678
Oh yeah, me too.

95
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,837
Really? Wow.

96
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,229
Yeah, just for myself though.

97
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,240
Well, I like your audience.

98
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,515
You make enough money to live
walking dogs?

99
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,480
I also worked at an Applebee's,
part-time.

100
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,471
I love Applebee's.

101
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:43,152
Oh yeah? My name's Jim.

102
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,431
Anika.

103
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,754
Nice to meet you, Anika.

104
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,350
You want one?

105
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,116
Sure.

106
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,950
You like working in a hospital?

107
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,556
Sure.

108
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,838
You don't find it too antiseptic?

109
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,469
Too cold and clean. Uncomfortable.

110
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,951
I think hospital beds are more
comfortable than regular beds.

111
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,675
Do you have a?

112
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,439
Oh. Yeah. Maybe.

113
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,675
Give it to me.

114
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,718
Did you come?

115
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,759
Time out.

116
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,080
Okay. We have a minute left in the
half. I'm going to make this easy.

117
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,160
Are you listening?

118
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,880
Yes, Coach Tim.

119
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,680
Don't take a shot unless you're
sure you can make it. Okay?

120
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,280
Take your time.
Look for an open shot.

121
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,320
But don't shoot it unless you're
positive it's going to go in.

122
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,598
Rachel, don't shoot it at all.

123
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,360
All right. One, two, three...

124
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,191
Go Ladders.

125
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,960
I am just miserable anywhere I go.

126
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,598
I'm unhappy too.

127
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,112
I just don't know what I'm doing
here. On earth. In this life.

128
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,829
You know what the answer is?

129
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,831
No.

130
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,120
Nothing. There is no answer.
As far as the world's concerned,

131
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,509
people like me might
as well not even exist.

132
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,634
I am really unhappy.

133
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,756
I know. If I were you,
I'm not even sure I could do it.

134
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,750
Do what?

135
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,160
Go on. I mean,
I think about ending it all as it is.

136
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,230
I can't imagine if I had your life.

137
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,909
Why?

138
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,120
Well... divorced with a shit job at
a lumber yard after being rejected

139
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,190
from the Cromwell police force.

140
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,631
And you wanted to be in the CIA.

141
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,600
I mean, look how far away you are

142
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,360
from everything you wanted to be.

143
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,560
You live with mom and dad
just to cover child support.

144
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,960
Making a dollar over
minimum wage at 32 years old.

145
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,720
I mean I'm a fuckup.

146
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,631
But you, you're a god-damn tragedy.

147
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,476
Yeah.

148
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,073
There's been an accident.

149
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,995
Is Tim okay?

150
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,359
He's in a coma.

151
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:50,960
How?

152
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,359
A car accident.

153
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,515
Who hit him?

154
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,279
A tree.

155
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,396
This isn't your brother's first accident.

156
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,396
What do you mean?

157
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,873
Oh, Jimmy.

158
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,638
I have to get a drink of water,
does anybody want anything?

159
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,760
Why do you got a plate there, Sally?

160
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,680
I thought I'd set
Tim's place at the table,

161
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,716
just so he knows
we're thinking of him.

162
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,880
Jesus Christ. He's not dead, Sally.

163
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,518
I know, I just...

164
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,115
You want some juice,
Jimmy? I'll get you some juice.

165
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,549
Can you help?

166
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:45,000
I said I'd coach the girl's team.

167
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,753
Well, we really could use you at
the factory now, too.

168
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,520
Your mom's
having a real hard time with this.

169
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,714
And she's already short handed.

170
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Oh, jeez. I... I don't know.

171
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,633
What's to know?
You either will or you won't.

172
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,555
I guess I'm going to
have to say that I won't.

173
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,794
Yes you will, god damn it.

174
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,030
You hear that, Sally?

175
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:16,840
What?

176
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,280
Jim want's to know
if he can come work for you?

177
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,555
No he doesn't.

178
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,994
Yeah... I do, Mom.

179
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,711
Well, of course you can.
You know Mom would love your help.

180
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,989
Jim, you remember your dad's
brother, Uncle Stacy?

181
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,200
Tim or Jim?

182
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,954
Um, Jim... the one not in a coma.

183
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,553
He's our little one.
Tim's the oldest.

184
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,120
Something happen to him?

185
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,760
He had an accident.

186
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,440
No one told me.

187
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,238
Don probably didn't want to bother
you on your weekend.

188
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Uncle Stacy started helping us out
here at work a year or so ago.

189
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,120
He'll get you started.

190
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,874
I'm going to use your daddy's
office to call the hospital, ok.

191
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,309
Watch my snacks.

192
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,119
Okay.

193
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,640
Sorry about your brother.

194
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,039
Thanks, Stacy.

195
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,395
Call me Evil.

196
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,749
Evil?

197
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,997
So, you a... you get high, right?

198
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,671
What? No.

199
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,954
Yeah, you do.

200
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,835
What makes you think that?

201
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,393
First off your mother.

202
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,878
You got to be on tranquilizers
to deal with a bitch like that.

203
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,431
Hey. Are you going to
pay for that candy bar?

204
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,200
You know what you aughta do is

205
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,636
you oaughta come over to
my trailer during lunch time.

206
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,437
I have good stuff. Fuck you up.

207
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,713
Hey, Evil, got a snack for me?

208
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,720
Oh he's cool. This is my nephew.
Whaddya want?

209
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,676
Give me ten dollars
worth of Nutty Bar.

210
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,759
This'll do ya.

211
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,360
All you have to do
is get in Ten baskets

212
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,673
and then you are free to go home.
Starting now.

213
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,958
Hey. Brought you some chips.

214
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,956
Think you might want
to wake up soon?

215
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,512
The girls' need their coach.

216
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,640
Also, Dad's making me
work for Mom

217
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,031
until you snap out of this.
So... Come on,

218
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,070
you dumb fuck. Wake up.

219
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,310
What are you doing?

220
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:59,160
Oh, hey. What are you doing?

221
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,320
I work here.

222
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,000
Have you met my... I mean, this is my
brother. Is he one of your patients?

223
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,911
No. I'm in pediatrics.

224
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,680
Jeez, how are you?

225
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,989
I'm fine. How's he?

226
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,999
Good, good. I mean, he's in a coma.

227
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,469
What happened?

228
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,395
Hit a tree.

229
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,678
I'd hate to see the tree.

230
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,111
I bet you were hoping
never to see me again.

231
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:45,432
What? No, of course not.
What are you doing later?

232
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,754
I'm busy.

233
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,759
Okay.

234
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,952
I'm free Saturday.

235
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,677
Okay. Saturday.

236
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,394
Do you want my number?

237
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,919
You already gave it to me.

238
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,195
You still have it?

239
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:13,472
Yeah. What is it, again?

240
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,913
I call you

241
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,600
Whenever you pee,

242
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:45,120
you just got to turn it off
and hold it in every couple of seconds.

243
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,634
Like a faucet. You pee in spurts.

244
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,075
What's that do?

245
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,240
Teaches it control. You know,
the dick is kind of like a dog.

246
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,390
Can't do anymore
than what you teach it.

247
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:07,075
My cocker spaniel can last a full ten
minutes before spooging down the hole

248
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,595
Ten minutes?

249
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,680
Ain't no girl need longer than that
to get her scream on.

250
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,113
Do you have a girlfriend, Evil?

251
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:29,553
Nah, I get hookers. Cheaper.
Want a snack?

252
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,110
No thanks.

253
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,555
How you like the weed?

254
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,989
It's strong.

255
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,591
Yeah, I put a little crack in it.

256
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,430
Hey, come check this out.

257
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,999
What?

258
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,557
They're dead animal skulls.

259
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,633
Hey. Will you open a checking
account for me?

260
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,320
What? / A checking account.

261
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,800
Oh man, I have been banned
from banks for like the next 7 years,

262
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:27,120
and there is a guy down state willing
to sell me a human skull,

263
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,554
but he says all I have
to do is send him a check.

264
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,159
Well, how would it work?

265
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,672
You open an account with my money
and then write the check for me.

266
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,356
Why would I want to do that?

267
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,876
I'd let you write some for yourself.

268
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:53,116
Make up for all those birthdays
and graduations I missed.

269
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,676
There's four grand in there.

270
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,680
Thanks man. Hey, make sure when
they give you those checkbooks

271
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,877
you don't get the kind
with kittens or seashells on them.

272
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,475
Okay.

273
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,840
I just hate those things. Really
pisses me off. They are tacky.

274
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,717
I said okay.

275
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,560
Why do you pee like that, Jimmy?

276
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,800
Get out of here.

277
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,520
Is something wrong with your
urinary tract?

278
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,398
What? No. Just get out of here.

279
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,640
Oh, Jimmy, I was wondering
if you might watch the girls

280
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,631
while I do some grocery shopping.

281
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,240
I'm sorry,
I sort of have something to do.

282
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,356
Well, okay. That's okay.

283
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,835
You always left Tim and me alone.

284
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,720
Can I borrow the van?

285
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,199
Of course, Honey.

286
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:12,677
You can just drop me off at the store.

287
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,078
Oh, well, I'm not really
going that way...

288
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,469
Never mind.

289
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,000
I could take you
to the end of the way.

290
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,549
Oh, no. I'lljust walk.
It'll be good for me.

291
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,509
Thanks, Mom.

292
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,880
You need any money?

293
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,873
Oh. No. Actually, I'm good.

294
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,120
Hey there.

295
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,519
Are you our date?

296
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,714
Mom takes me on
all her first dates.

297
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,796
Your mother and I already
had a first date.

298
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,990
When?

299
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,310
Last week.

300
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,990
The night she was out until three
in the morning?

301
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,349
Ready?

302
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,555
Why is there a bed set up back here?

303
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,960
Do you live in this van?

304
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,710
Benjamin.

305
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,751
No, I don't live in this van.

306
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,759
Wine coolers? Really?

307
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,200
What?

308
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,077
Mom's a whiskey woman.

309
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,033
So, where are we going?

310
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,999
Where would you like to go?

311
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,000
There's ice skating at the
Glenbrook mall.

312
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,750
No.

313
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,313
I know somewhere better.

314
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:33,278
Girls, I'd like you to meet a
friend of mine.

315
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,990
This is Ben.

316
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,360
I thought maybe you might want to
show him the trampoline out back.

317
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,280
You have a trampoline?

318
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,431
No, but our neighbors do.
Take him girls.

319
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,080
It's freezing outside.

320
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,274
Wear your coats.

321
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,559
You live with your parents?

322
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,798
Just temporarily. I'm leaving soon
as my brother recovers.

323
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,760
Yeah. I sort of came back
to have a nervous breakdown

324
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,352
but the bastard beat me to it.

325
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,433
What's wrong with you?

326
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,079
Chronic despair.

327
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,640
Hey, what are you kids doing?

328
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,914
Jumping.

329
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,190
Well, who told you, you could jump
on our trampoline?

330
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,520
Jim.

331
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,960
He's my uncle.

332
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,840
Well, tell your Uncle Jim that he
needs to ask me before...

333
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,480
He's not my uncle.
I hardly know him.

334
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,240
He's on a date
with my mother right now.

335
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,160
He took Mom up to his room...

336
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,833
Okay, okay. That's fine.
Just ask next time.

337
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,320
Where's Benjamin's dad?

338
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:59,880
He's around. He sees Ben every once
a month or so, if he remembers.

339
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,480
And he doesn't have a
problem with you dating?

340
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,909
Oh, no. He's incredibly jealous.
Who are all these people?

341
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,517
They're all writers.

342
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:13,910
Oh yeah?

343
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:18,800
That's Virginia Woolf.
Underneath her is Richard Yates,

344
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,880
he's one of my favorites.

345
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,480
What'd he write?

346
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,800
Sad stories about sad people with
pathetic dreams.

347
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,320
When he died almost all of his
books were out of a print.

348
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,920
That's weird.

349
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,880
Then of course there's Poe
and Plath and Buroughs.

350
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,040
Thats a writer named
Breece D Pancake.

351
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,640
Next to him is Beckett.
Then Dorothy Parker.

352
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,480
The big one is Hemingway.

353
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,640
Oh yeah, I read him in high school.
He's good.

354
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,640
What did you like about him?

355
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,074
I think he had a boner
for what he did, you know?

356
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,440
Yeah.

357
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,880
His stories weren't as stuffy and
made up as others. They were realer.

358
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,790
He was a realist.

359
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,355
Maybe that's why.

360
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,918
He shot himself in the head.

361
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,235
Geez.

362
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,154
So did Pancake. That one
threw himself off a bridge.

363
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,472
She put her head in an oven.

364
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,710
And that one, that one and
that one all drank themselves to death.

365
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,874
Is Benjamin's dad going to
try and hurt me?

366
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,911
You? No.

367
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,120
I thought you said he was
insanely jealous?

368
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,917
He wouldn't be jealous of you.

369
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,476
Why not?

370
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,839
He just wouldn't.
Besides, we're not dating.

371
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,395
We're not?

372
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,475
Hey could you guys...
could you uh...

373
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,432
Do you have any board games?

374
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,748
Oh god.

375
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,838
I brought you some snacks.

376
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,400
Thanks. Did you bring
any of those Funions?

377
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,918
No is that what you wanted, Honey?
But I do have some pork rinds.

378
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,914
How you feeling, Tim?

379
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,595
Shitty.

380
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,077
You're lucky to be alive, boy.

381
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,791
I called the girls' mother.
They should be here soon.

382
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,360
How are they?

383
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,160
Oh, they're good.
I told them to make sure

384
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,835
and pray for you every night before
they went to bed.

385
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,108
You had to tell them?

386
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,560
Honey, you know what I mean.

387
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,360
Jesus Christ, Tim.

388
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,113
Donald, he just woke up from a coma.

389
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,710
And why was he in a
coma in the first place?

390
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,637
He had an accident.

391
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,836
Is that what happened?
Did he have an accident?

392
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,478
Yeah, I lived.

393
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:15,312
Don't say that.
Don't you dare ever say that.

394
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:21,511
You're mom's baby. You're my big baby.

395
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,709
Oh, God.

396
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,989
I'm going to get a drink of water.
You want anything?

397
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,349
Nah.

398
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,720
Oh. Hey. I was just looking for you.

399
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,520
Really?

400
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:02,960
Yeah.

401
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,076
Because you smell like you were
just smoking.

402
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,474
Where's mom and dad?

403
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,318
I asked them to leave.

404
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,071
Oh, well how am
I supposed to get home?

405
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,114
I don't know.
We didn't talk about it.

406
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,830
I got to get back to work.
It was nice meeting you, Tim.

407
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,673
Please don't hesitate to ring
me if you need something.

408
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,558
You either, liar.

409
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,396
See you.

410
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,270
She's hot.

411
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,560
You think?

412
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,120
Yeah. You have sex with her?

413
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,753
Um, yeah.

414
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,834
That's awesome.

415
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,669
Thanks.

416
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,552
I meant for me.

417
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:58,589
It means she has no standards.
Bet she'd do it with me too.

418
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,440
Daddy!

419
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,429
Girls.

420
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,959
Where's your mother?

421
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,351
She's waiting downstairs.

422
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,398
Everything okay, Jim?

423
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,791
Yeah, I was just writing.

424
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,915
You see your brother tonight?

425
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,553
He's looking better, don't you think?

426
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,750
Yeah.

427
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,876
I love talking to you, Jimmy.

428
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,080
How was work for you?

429
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,956
Good.

430
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,591
I know you'd rather not be there...

431
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:42,996
It's okay.

432
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,714
Your brother always
refused to work for us...

433
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,389
Really?

434
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,232
Jim. What did we do to make you
kids so unhappy?

435
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,235
I don't know.

436
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,311
But what do you think? Be honest.

437
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,637
Your such a smart,
sensitive boy, Jimmy.

438
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,672
I know you must have some opinion.

439
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,878
I don't know, Mom. Maybe some
people just shouldn't be parents.

440
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,236
I mean, it's just a thought.

441
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,350
Look...

442
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,234
No, I'm alright. Just tired.

443
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,800
Good night, pretty boy.

444
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,074
Good night.

445
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,272
Look cold, want a ride?

446
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,835
On that?

447
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,720
I bought it with one of your
checks. Whaddya think?

448
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,630
It's great.

449
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,030
You drive. I'm tripping
my head off right now.

450
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,960
What the fuck was that about?

451
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,995
Dunno.

452
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,960
Sally has been arrested for using the
company's Fed Ex account to ship drugs

453
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,160
They have proof of her signature on
over a dozen packages sent from here

454
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,400
Are you kidding?

455
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,800
No I am not kidding does
it sound like I am kidding?

456
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,040
Maybe?

457
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,480
Well, I'm not. Now listen,
I'm going down there to explain to

458
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,789
these peckerheads that
they got the wrong person.

459
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,829
What I need you to do is cover
for your mom and me while I'm gone.

460
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,079
Sure, sure.

461
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,554
No problem, Donny.

462
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,873
If anyone asks what's going on,
just play dumb.

463
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,600
So, who do you think did this?

464
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,640
You.

465
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,400
Me? I can't believe you'd think
that your own...

466
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,360
Cut the bullshit, Evil.
I know it was you.

467
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,640
All right, you got me.

468
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,756
How could you be such an idiot?

469
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,200
I wrapped everyone of those
packages in foil,

470
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,000
and then I double
plastic bagged them,

471
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,760
and then I'd put a little Big League
Chew in there too, Grape...

472
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,120
They are taking
my mom to PRISON, Evil.

473
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,960
I understand that.

474
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,430
But you're not going to rat
out your Uncle Stace now, are you?

475
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,720
You think I'd let my mother stay
locked-up for you?

476
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:45,680
I'd be a little nervous to narc-out
a guy with no money

477
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,319
after you'd just opened
a four thousand dollar account.

478
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,669
You fucker.

479
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,440
Just be careful when you point a
finger at someone else

480
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,592
you are pointing three at
yourself and a thumb to the sky.

481
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,359
What's that mean?

482
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,313
That means, is your piss clean?

483
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,200
What are you doing here?

484
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,720
Mom brought me.

485
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,278
What is your mom doing here?

486
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,240
I didn't know that.

487
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,791
There's a lot people don't know
about our Central Intelligence Agency.

488
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,440
Sounds so exciting.

489
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,080
It exciting and it's the type of work

490
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,548
you can't help
taking home with you, either.

491
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,439
Oh. Hey. Aren't you
home a little early?

492
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:52,558
Something happened at work.

493
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,276
What's wrong?

494
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:58,914
I'm sorry, what exactly
are you doing here?

495
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:03,640
I thought I'd help
your brother get situated.

496
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,880
Did the hospital send you?

497
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:06,676
No.

498
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,711
Hey, I'm doing you a favor.

499
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,235
Oh, yeah, I can see what a favor
you're doing.

500
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,960
Hey, you like basketball?

501
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:43,040
No.

502
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,000
Ever played before?

503
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,840
No.

504
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,829
Want to?

505
00:49:52,440 --> 00:50:02,350
Okay. Everybody, this is Ben. Ben
this is Rachel, Sarah and...

506
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,880
the rest of the team.

507
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,032
Now, why don't you all
grab a ball and start practicing?

508
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,680
It's one of my favorites.

509
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:29,869
Well, thanks so much, Sweetie. Mom
is so happy you came down to visit.

510
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,671
So, what is this book about?

511
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,269
An impotent man's futile love.

512
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:46,994
Oh... great. Thanks so much,
Sweetheart.

513
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:53,351
So, how is it in here?

514
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:59,595
Oh, it's not so bad.
The women are all very talkative.

515
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,957
I'm sorry about this, Mom.

516
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:07,909
Oh Honey, It's not your fault.

517
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,000
The police put a
freeze on our business,

518
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,240
they figured that it was
a drug front.

519
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,233
I can't even get into my own company
they got padlocks on the doors.

520
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,195
Your kidding.

521
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,232
There's nothing I can do.

522
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,358
A girl's here to see you.

523
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,629
Said she's a nurse.
Brought a little kid with her.

524
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,595
He's sitting right next to you, dad.
His name's Ben.

525
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,760
Oh. Hi, Ben.

526
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:23,510
Hello.

527
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,878
You want to get me another one of
these from the fridge, buddy.

528
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,355
Okay.

529
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,595
Hi.

530
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,119
Don't you work anymore?

531
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,039
It's my day off.

532
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,758
My father and brother are both in
the house and Ben is just downstairs.

533
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,039
I didn't come for that.

534
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,628
Well why?

535
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,758
I don't know Jim,
I like to help people.

536
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,270
Come in.

537
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,999
Oh. You.

538
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,469
Evil.

539
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,988
This is Stacy.

540
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,669
Stacy.

541
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,435
Yeah?

542
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,633
Evil, I have to talk to you.

543
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,280
You wanna get in on this I still
got a half hour?

544
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,635
The police have seized
my parents' business, Evil.

545
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:24,159
Damn, man. That's too much.
That's... What are you going to do?

546
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,719
What are you going to do?

547
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,960
Common there's not a jury in the
world that's going to believe that

548
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,757
that woman is selling drugs.

549
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,389
They will believe a guy like me does.

550
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,669
You do, Evil.

551
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,119
See.

552
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,680
There's only one thing to do here,
Evil. And you know what it is.

553
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:49,680
What? Confess and go to jail and
man-rape for the next five years?

554
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,720
You make your own choices.

555
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,840
Look there's three thousand dollars
left in that account.

556
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,800
That'll get you pretty far from here

557
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,960
No, I'm not going to
sell my family out.

558
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,359
Look, I'm family too.

559
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:04,756
I can't believe you.

560
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:09,920
Hold on shithead.
That money is in your name

561
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,478
and if you don't give it back to me

562
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,750
then it's like you already accepted it.

563
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,159
Make your own choices.

564
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,711
Jim Hey.

565
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,395
What?

566
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,399
It's full.

567
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,470
What's full?

568
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,754
Jesus Christ, man. What don't you
get your nurse do this?

569
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,957
I couldn't ask her to do that.
That's disgusting.

570
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,350
Well, what do you
want me to do with it?

571
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:48,870
Clean it.

572
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,829
Fuck that.

573
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,158
I need something to pee in.

574
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:15,480
Okay. Uhhh. Just do
what you want today.

575
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,754
I don't know what to tell you.

576
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,839
What kind of coach are you?

577
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,712
Oh. Hey.

578
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,590
Your team's not even playing
basketball.

579
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,472
Whatever.

580
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,760
You must not think much of your
nieces then. Or Ben.

581
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:48,920
Or any of those kids out there.

582
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,036
You must not
think much of me, either, I guess.

583
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:56,589
Oh, I do. I think you're all great.

584
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,320
What?

585
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,117
You think I'm great?

586
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,276
Well, sure.

587
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,913
I think you're great.

588
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:18,440
There are so many fun
and cheery people in the world.

589
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,749
Don't you think you'd be
better off with one of them?

590
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,919
Someone more like yourself?

591
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,996
You think I'm fun and cheery?

592
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,829
Of course you are.

593
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,760
You just can't stop
complimenting me, can you?

594
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,840
You're missing my point.

595
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:36,628
No, I'm not.
I'm getting it very clearly.

596
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,440
You want to come in?

597
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,396
It's okay. I don't mind.

598
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:19,070
No. I think I'lljust
say good bye here.

599
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:20,356
Okay.

600
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,389
Bye, Ben.

601
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,910
Bye.

602
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,915
Bye, Anika.

603
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,879
Good night, Jim.

604
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,468
You can kiss if you want.
I don't care.

605
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,680
You're kind of apathetic for such a
little guy, aren't you, Ben?

606
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,749
Yeah.

607
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,435
Good night, you two.

608
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:17,033
Mom, you're home.

609
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,156
Yup.

610
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:20,516
How?

611
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:24,798
Something called bail. One of the
girls in prison told me about it.

612
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,677
Apparently your father never
realized it was an option.

613
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,880
I called a very nice
bondsman in Kendalville

614
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,757
who put up the money for me.

615
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:41,269
That's great.

616
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,560
Oh, honey don't touch that.
It's for Kiki.

617
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:46,480
Who's Kiki?

618
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,438
She's the con that gave me the
number for the bondsman.

619
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,520
I'm going to bring
cobbler to her and all of girls

620
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,192
I made friends with at County.

621
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,640
All those ladies were so nice to me.

622
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,153
It's hard to believe
they're criminals.

623
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,359
Have you talked to Tim?

624
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,956
Oh. Yeah. Same old Tim.

625
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,513
I need a fork.

626
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,149
My Fork!

627
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:21,594
Jimmy. Jim. Yoo-hoo. Jimmy.
Wake up. You have visitors.

628
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,677
Who?

629
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,589
Get your ass up, Jim.
It's four o' clock.

630
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:29,840
Sorry to say ass in front of you,
Mrs. Roush.

631
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:32,479
Oh, no. It worked.

632
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,110
Hi, Jimmy.

633
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,640
Hi, Mom.

634
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,640
You have a nice nap?

635
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,640
Yeah.

636
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,200
Your little friend, Ben, is helping
me make dinner downstairs.

637
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,520
Oh. Ben's here?

638
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,999
We're making goulash.

639
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,793
Jim's my pretty boy.

640
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,233
I brought you something.

641
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,750
What?

642
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,914
Don't get too excited, it's not much.

643
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:10,710
What is it?

644
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:14,514
A smile, for poor old Hemingway.

645
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:22,719
I don't know.
It doesn't look right to me.

646
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:26,353
That's because you're used to
seeing it the other way.

647
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,878
The other way is true to life.

648
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,790
The other way is depressing.

649
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:35,789
Like I said...

650
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,188
Oh, Jim.

651
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:41,993
You smell nice.

652
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,234
Thanks.

653
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,758
I like you a lot, Anika.

654
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:58,640
I like you a lot, too. So does Ben.

655
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,311
He does?

656
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,600
Oh my God, he totally looks up to you.

657
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,880
Oh no.

658
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,074
It's true.

659
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,552
Ben shouldn't look up to me.

660
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,920
Sure he should.

661
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,040
No he shouldn't.

662
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,109
Why?

663
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,398
I think I might of caused my
brother to hurt himself.

664
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,429
That's crazy.

665
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:23,673
I told him life was pointless and I
couldn't believe he hadn't killed himself.

666
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:36,400
So, Anika, I understand you're a nurse.

667
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,640
Yes, I am Mrs. Roush.

668
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,755
That's great.

669
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:41,679
I love the work.

670
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,440
So, where'd you two meet?

671
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:45,429
At a bar.

672
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,480
Tim just can't stop saying enough
nice things about you.

673
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:54,360
Oh, how is Tim?
I haven't talked to him today.

674
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:55,640
Oh he's good.

675
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,280
Benjamin?

676
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,880
Yes.

677
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,279
Do you go to school yet?

678
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,440
He's in third grade.

679
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,520
Third grade? But you're so little.

680
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,635
You're little.

681
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:09,800
Benjamin.

682
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:14,200
Anika? As you know
Tim broke both of his legs

683
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:16,840
so he can't easily
get in and out of bed

684
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:20,760
we got him one
of those crooked plastic bottles for

685
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,920
you know his business,

686
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,120
but its not
quite big enough for his...

687
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:25,996
Mom...

688
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:35,119
To tell you the truth I don't
really like my family that much.

689
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,436
What a terrible thing to say.

690
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,600
Its true I mean
I love them all to death,

691
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:47,195
but I just can't stand to be so close.

692
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,116
Well what good is that kind of love?

693
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,640
I'm thinking of leaving.
You know, I was thinking,

694
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:05,269
maybe you and
Ben could come with me.

695
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,909
Where?

696
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,595
I don't know.

697
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:12,349
Great. Sounds like a good plan.

698
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,239
Where would you like to go?

699
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,231
I can't afford to go anywhere.

700
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,080
Sure you can. There are nursing
jobs all over the country.

701
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,718
Just pick a place.

702
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:33,036
Well, you know, I've always wanted
to go to New Orleans.

703
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,233
New Orleans. Why New Orleans?

704
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,273
Bourbon St.

705
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,553
What's your second choice?

706
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:44,590
Vegas.

707
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,196
I've heard really good things about
New Orleans. Let's try it there first.

708
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,954
I can't just up and
move to New Orleans.

709
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:54,073
You can if you do.

710
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,552
What about Ben's dad?

711
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:03,669
He's a deadbeat.
I should be Ben's dad.

712
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,919
You're crazy.

713
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:14,874
Am I?

714
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,588
What's this?

715
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,918
It's an Inspector Nestor book.

716
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,640
Remember when you used
to read these to me?

717
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:41,632
You'd always know how each story was
going to end half way through every book.

718
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,672
They were predictable.

719
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,072
Maybe. I could never guess them.

720
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:48,994
You're an idiot.

721
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:52,080
Anyway, I found them in the garage.

722
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:55,311
Thought maybe you could
read em to the girls.

723
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:04,320
They miss you, you know?
The whole team misses you.

724
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:05,309
Sure.

725
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,355
They do.

726
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,839
I bet they haven't even noticed.

727
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:23,110
They're playing their last game
this weekend.

728
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,520
Anything you want me to tell the
team at last practice?

729
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,430
Tell them to make a fucking basket.

730
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:08,874
I can't do it.

731
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:13,637
Maybe you can. Maybe you can't.
But you'll never know unless you try.

732
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,679
I've been trying all practice.

733
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,669
True.

734
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:21,748
Hey, you two.

735
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:22,800
Hey.

736
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:26,040
What gives? I thought practice was
supposed to be over 30 minutes ago

737
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:29,191
Jim won't let me go
until I make five more baskets.

738
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,280
I'm sorry Benjamin.

739
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,200
I didn't mean to make
you feel like you couldn't go home

740
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,519
if you didn't make the shots.

741
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,398
But that's what you said.

742
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,874
Why didn't you call if you knew you
were going to be late?

743
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,480
I'm sorry, I didn't know it was
that big a deal.

744
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:49,632
Yeah, well it is a big deal. Stuff
like that is a very big deal to moms.

745
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,397
What's your problem, Anika?

746
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:57,108
Nothing, Jim.

747
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:01,600
Just, you can't ask a girl
to move 1082 miles away with you

748
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,636
unless you're
really going to follow through.

749
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,198
Why wouldn't I follow through?

750
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,355
Because you don't know what it
would be like.

751
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,558
What would it be like?

752
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,640
Difficult. Very difficult.

753
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,997
Great. I'm used to challenges.

754
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,270
You're use to avoiding them.

755
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:34,471
Well, maybe I don't want you to.

756
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:43,558
Oh. Okay.

757
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,239
I just said maybe.

758
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:52,559
No, the whole idea was stupid
anyway. Come on Ben.

759
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,193
Come on Anika.

760
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,238
I'd like to make a withdraw please.

761
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:23,517
I need to be on my own.

762
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:28,998
I understand. Sometimes Mom wishes
she could be on her own too.

763
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,794
What?

764
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,711
Nothing. Just kidding.

765
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,270
Where you going to?

766
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,959
Maybe New Orleans.

767
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:49,753
Oh fun. You know Mom's never really
been anywhere.

768
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,389
I know Mom.

769
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,148
Maybe I'll come visit
you after my trial.

770
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,196
Or before, either would be great.

771
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:02,118
I can't really leave the state until after

772
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:07,908
Jimmy.

773
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:32,480
All right team,
I know it's been a rough season

774
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,360
Girls... but...

775
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,960
Sorry, I'm late.

776
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,120
No problem, Benjamin.
Is your mom here?

777
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:40,109
No.

778
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:51,520
Like I said, I know it's been a
rough season for us this year.

779
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:54,920
Not a lot of shots have fallen for us.

780
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:59,516
In fact not a single shot has
fallen for us in 14 games.

781
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:04,800
So I guess the question
we need to ask ourselves is,

782
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:09,032
are we going to let those 14 games
determine the next one?

783
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:11,880
Because if we are

784
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,560
, then we may as welljust go out there
and shake hands with the other team.

785
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,360
Congratulate them on their victory.

786
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:22,560
I see some of you nodding
your heads in agreement right now.

787
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:27,320
By all means, it's not an
altogether absurd idea. Odds are,

788
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:30,153
we are going to lose no matter how
we go about playing this game.

789
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:39,314
So why do we play at all? Well team...

790
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:44,354
I don't really have an answer for that.

791
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,113
And do you know why?

792
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:55,915
Because its a stupid question asked
by a doubtful and unhappy man.

793
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:02,200
Forget his question.
You just got to keep playing.

794
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:05,400
Because if you don't you might end
up like him and let me tell you,

795
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:09,080
he is no fun. Nobody
knows what we're capable of.

796
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,436
The past does not
always predict the future.

797
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,398
Now that team may have seen
us play before

798
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,237
but they've never
seen us play today.

799
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:25,548
Am I right? / Yeah.

800
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:27,800
Am I right?

801
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,080
Yeah.

802
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:35,030
Well, all right then. Well let's
show them what we can do.

803
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,356
One, two, three. Go Ladders.

804
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,957
Hey, come on. Come over here.

805
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:40,357
No long faces. That was good.
That was our best game yet.

806
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:41,869
Shut up, Jim.

807
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,273
Good job, Jimmy.
You make a great coach.

808
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:10,600
Dear Mom
I don't know where to start,

809
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,433
so I'lljust begin with the
end and work my way back.

810
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:19,109
I came home because I ran out of
money and had nowhere else to go.

811
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,597
If I'd had any other option,
I would have taken it.

812
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,270
I did not consider the simple fact
of having a place to return a blessing

813
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:31,996
Instead, I thought of it
as a burden and a symbol of failure.

814
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:35,879
I'm ashamed to admit that
growing up I pitied you

815
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:39,480
and what I thought was your naive
belief that our dreams could come true,

816
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:41,436
simply by virtue of having them.

817
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,714
Because the truth, as I witnessed it,
was something completely different.

818
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:58,320
The truth actually was that nothing
worked out and no one,

819
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:00,515
anywhere lived the life they wanted.

820
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,513
But I see now, that it was
me with the naive belief.

821
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:13,435
I thought if I
resigned myself to disappointment,

822
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:16,916
at least I'd be better off then
those people who tried and failed.

823
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,115
And I hate myself
for only realizing this now

824
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:23,716
and for taking and taking from you
without giving anything back.

825
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:28,955
You are one of the few good peaches in
are one of the few good peaches in

826
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,671
I promise not to waste anymore time
or take your love for granted again.

827
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:40,637
I love you so much. Jim.

828
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,720
P.S. The money in this
envelope is from Stacy.

829
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:52,269
I figure he owes you at least this
much for all the snacks he's stolen.

830
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,997
And he's the one who's been sending
drugs through the Fed Ex account.

831
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:15,232
Promise to call you soon. Jim

832
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,589
Thirsty?

833
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:51,509
What are you doing here?

834
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:57,593
Benjamin wanted to apologize to you
for telling you to shut up.

835
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,999
I'm sorry Jim.

836
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:05,995
That's alright, Benjamin.
How'd you find me?

837
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:10,556
We stopped by the house
to see you. Your dad told us.

838
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,276
Where you going?

839
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,908
New Orleans. / Great.

840
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:27,514
Benjamin,
do you want to say goodbye to Jim?

841
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:29,596
Bye, Jim.

842
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,392
Bye... Benji.

843
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,680
You be good to your mother.

844
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:40,399
And promise me not to
get too much more apathetic.

845
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:42,838
At least not until your teens.

846
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,154
Okay.

847
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,630
It never would have
worked out anyway.

848
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,793
Is that your bus?

849
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:14,869
Yeah.

850
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:17,438
You better run.

851
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,035
Bye.

852
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:32,754
Bye, Jim.

853
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:55,759
Stop that, Benji.

854
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:05,713
Common lets go.

855
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,278
Mom. Stop the car.

856
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,875
Can I get a ride?

857
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:12,875
Sure.

858
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:50,111
I thought you never ran.
