1
00:02:53,444 --> 00:02:56,967
Hi, Sarah. I am, Dad.

2
00:02:57,808 --> 00:02:59,305
I call again to check on you.

3
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:01,973
I am very close, Pennsylvania ...

4
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:04,975
and I'm doing a Play.

5
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,139
Return to Theatre.

6
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:10,701
Anyway...

7
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:12,264
I have something for you...

8
00:03:12,343 --> 00:03:16,426
so call me, okay?

9
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:17,989
Please?

10
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,391
It's nice.
eleven
00: 03: 22,752 -> 00: 03: 24.356
The necklace.

12
00:03:26,238 --> 00:03:28,520
Yes, it was ...

13
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,520
It was my mother.

14
00:03:33,324 --> 00:03:35,767
I venture to guess something.
fifteen
00: 03: 36.607 -> 00: 03: 38.731
You play to Wanda.

16
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:40,092
How did you know that?

17
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,013
Lucky?

18
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:44,381
Or maybe it was because the
list of characters ...

19
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:48,900
the described filled
innocence, beauty and charm.

20
00:03:50,702 --> 00:03:52,866
Are you part of the cast?

21
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:55,187
I am your father.

22
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:58,470
- John Larousse.
- Wendy Glenn.
2. 3
00: 03: 58.510 -> 00: 04: 00.633
You have the same age as my daughter.

24
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:02,834
The same beautiful green eyes.

25
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:05,760
Surely your father was difficult
keep away the boys.

26
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,320
Not really.

27
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:17,611
LOST

28
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:22,494
Look at them.

29
00:04:22,535 --> 00:04:26,218
Can you believe it? There are many dogs.

30
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:30,102
Well maybe they are so bored here ...

31
00:04:30,142 --> 00:04:32,465
who fled to the city.

32
00:04:41,673 --> 00:04:44,556
- You are the actors?
- Yes.

33
00:04:44,597 --> 00:04:47,240
Great. Suban.
3. 4
00: 04: 55.128 -> 00: 04: 57.091
Is not I seen you before?

35
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,371
- Than?
- Do not I seen you before?

36
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,136
- Been to a movie or something?
- In some.

37
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:06,539
Great. That is fantastic.

38
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:11,745
Would you mind lowering
the volume a second?

39
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:13,347
Insurance.

40
00:05:13,386 --> 00:05:16,149
I Music Hall and
Oates if that's your rhythm.

41
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,149
I can put it.

42
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:21,114
My fault. It's my fault.

43
00:05:24,477 --> 00:05:26,726
So...

44
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,721
Who are you calling?
4. 5
00: 05: 29,244 -> 00: 05: 30.765
To my daughter.

46
00:05:30,844 --> 00:05:33,649
Why did not you leave a message?

47
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:34,930
When I call someone ...

48
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:37,332
I like to leave a
message, so you know I called.

49
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:41,534
Brad you, right?

50
00:05:41,568 --> 00:05:42,936
Yes.

51
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:46,380
Tell me, Brad, do you work
for production?

52
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:48,022
Yes. Working Nicholas.

53
00:05:48,063 --> 00:05:50,104
What is it?

54
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:52,146
I do not know. He hired me over the phone.

55
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:54,749
This is my first role as well
I'm super excited.

56
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:57,071
Just a moment. If you are all in the Work?

57
00:05:57,111 --> 00:05:58,353
Ray, yes.

58
00:05:58,432 --> 00:06:01,677
There are tax incentives if
They put a local in the deal.

59
00:06:01,716 --> 00:06:05,280
- Meet the local.
- Do you act?

60
00:06:08,322 --> 00:06:09,484
You are crazy.

61
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,408
We are ruined.

62
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,723
The place is beautiful, right?

63
00:06:46,762 --> 00:06:48,845
It never has been allowed
anybody to stay here.

64
00:06:48,885 --> 00:06:50,726
It's like a state monument.

65
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:53,089
I heard Nicholas leased for one year.

66
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:55,130
- You know how much that costs?
- How much?

67
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:57,573
Do I look like an agent of real estate?

68
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,220
- That is...
- Amazing.

69
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,744
Yes. The rooms are upstairs.
There are about 15.

70
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:10,707
Take the one that is empty.

71
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:12,789
Mine is the last of
hallway to the left.

72
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:16,713
The one is next
Available ... Like me.

73
00:07:18,153 --> 00:07:21,037
My agent told me not
nothing about this part.

74
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:23,439
Maybe it up best.

75
00:07:26,882 --> 00:07:28,685
I'm afraid not.

76
00:08:15,172 --> 00:08:17,855
All they meet down.

77
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:19,817
I'll be down right away.

78
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:29,467
Look who's here.

79
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:32,390
John and Wendy, meet the gang.
Gang, John and Wendy.

80
00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:39,598
- Rebecca?
- John?

81
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:41,921
I do not understand why ...

82
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,843
- What are you doing here?
- I ask you the same.

83
00:08:45,922 --> 00:08:48,246
I guess I should introduce myself.

84
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,248
I am Lars Pearson.

85
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:54,252
I was born in Minnesota where I graduated
in drama at the University of ...

86
00:08:57,976 --> 00:08:59,177
University of...

87
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:01,420
Minnesota.

88
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,143
During the last
seven years I have acted ...

89
00:09:04,182 --> 00:09:06,945
in Theatre Company
Kansas City Repertory.

90
00:09:06,985 --> 00:09:08,988
My representation
Macbeth was hailed ...

91
00:09:09,028 --> 00:09:13,911
by KC Metropolis
as poetic and tragic.

92
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:23,123
I know you.

93
00:09:23,202 --> 00:09:24,765
John Larousse're ...

94
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:27,206
the demonized man.

95
00:09:27,246 --> 00:09:28,926
Guilty.

96
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,090
I knew you knew. OMG.

97
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,892
TMZ, December 2011,
went crazy on your hotel ...

98
00:09:33,933 --> 00:09:35,659
and an almost lances
desk out the window.

99
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:37,176
That was fabulous.

100
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,344
That was a different person.

101
00:09:44,423 --> 00:09:46,065
I'm not that person.

102
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:47,347
Forget it.

103
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:02,523
Rebecca.

104
00:10:04,524 --> 00:10:06,928
We should not work together. I'll leave.

105
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:10,289
Three months ago I'm sober.

106
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:11,490
Give a prize.

107
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,053
Rebecca, please.

108
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,176
I will leave.

109
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:19,860
I must stand by what causes me.

110
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,702
Is that what I am to you?

111
00:10:22,944 --> 00:10:25,745
What are you doing here?

112
00:10:25,826 --> 00:10:28,388
The director called my agent.

113
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:32,112
He is the one you want
hire me at this time.

114
00:10:32,153 --> 00:10:33,994
I will retire.

115
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,603
We rehearse and act.

116
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,007
I will not mention the past,
you do not mention this.

117
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:47,408
Done deal.

118
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:52,412
A question.

119
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:57,138
How's Sarah?

120
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:00,062
Okay, John. Very good.

121
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:03,865
Are you still seeing that as Keith?

122
00:11:03,945 --> 00:11:05,506
Are engaged.

123
00:11:07,748 --> 00:11:08,749
You're not serious.

124
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:11,032
Sometimes you have to
let her go, John.

125
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:14,795
True.

126
00:11:22,884 --> 00:11:25,967
So no one has read the script.

127
00:11:26,046 --> 00:11:27,969
Is it only the list of the cast?

128
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:32,055
They said the manuscript yet
It was available to the actors.

129
00:11:32,094 --> 00:11:34,696
The truth is that I would not have
read, if I had been given.

130
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,217
Work is work.

131
00:11:36,257 --> 00:11:38,340
The despair is so embarrassing.

132
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:40,142
You encantabas me.

133
00:11:41,704 --> 00:11:44,025
You were so good at being bad.

134
00:11:44,106 --> 00:11:48,230
Well, I'm glad I
left an impression.

135
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,191
Maybe you can help me.

136
00:11:50,232 --> 00:11:52,274
How to be bad?

137
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:55,197
I think I know how.

138
00:11:55,436 --> 00:11:58,560
I was thinking more if I
You would get a good agent ...

139
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,964
but one thing leads to another.

140
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:02,884
Quiet.

141
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:07,970
I would greatly appreciate it.

142
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:14,978
I have a daughter your age.

143
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:18,501
Are you so bored
you, as I am?

144
00:12:18,541 --> 00:12:21,024
Do you want more?

145
00:12:25,709 --> 00:12:27,510
Come on, boy zombie.

146
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:30,633
Throw some returns
to be interesting.

147
00:12:30,674 --> 00:12:34,357
Let's see how we act drunk
You can entertain tonight.

148
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:36,079
Please?

149
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,043
Do us a favor and shut up.

150
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:40,805
Please?

151
00:12:40,845 --> 00:12:42,205
Who the hell are you?

152
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:47,010
Have you done soap operas and
commercial detergent?

153
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:50,774
Big stars
together for this work.

154
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:55,418
Allison, you are sensually
bad, but you're a fool.

155
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:57,182
The dinner is ready.

156
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:07,631
Thank you.

157
00:13:08,912 --> 00:13:10,313
It's strange.

158
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:12,277
I once worked with her in New York.

159
00:13:12,316 --> 00:13:13,357
It was something irritable ...

160
00:13:13,437 --> 00:13:16,600
but nothing like tonight.

161
00:13:19,644 --> 00:13:21,205
Nice Food. Thanks, ladies.

162
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:22,447
So is.

163
00:13:22,527 --> 00:13:23,928
Thank you.

164
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,013
Does anyone know when
Nicholas will make an appearance?

165
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,654
At least let the refrigerator full.

166
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:35,539
Perhaps we are
fattening to kill us.

167
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:41,586
Is that something secret between you two?

168
00:13:41,626 --> 00:13:44,068
No, it is not, Allison.

169
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:46,911
John was referring to an old
and common history of theater ...

170
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,073
on a group of French actors.
Before the First World War.

171
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:53,237
They met to rehearse
a cottage near Lyon.

172
00:13:53,277 --> 00:13:57,643
Three days later, the
found dead, they bled.

173
00:13:57,683 --> 00:14:01,445
The director was fed to them
and he disappeared in the mountains ...

174
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:03,407
and they never found.

175
00:14:04,488 --> 00:14:06,171
Good to Know.

176
00:14:06,251 --> 00:14:08,374
I do not sleep soon.

177
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,976
It's just a silly story Theatre.

178
00:14:11,056 --> 00:14:14,179
The worst thing that can happen to us is that
We booed off stage.

179
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:16,622
I really doubt that happens.

180
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,870
There have been many
personifications of this work ...

181
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,794
but you are by far
the best cast I've chosen.

182
00:14:30,715 --> 00:14:33,879
Those who do not know me,
I am Nicholas tomask.

183
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,081
Thanks for being part
this production.

184
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:39,084
So we really adentremos
in our characters ...

185
00:14:39,124 --> 00:14:41,647
desire that no
contact with the outside world.

186
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:43,568
Can you give me their mobile phones?

187
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:44,811
That is absurd.

188
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,654
I know. It's ridiculous.

189
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,498
But I see actors
very easily they distracted.

190
00:14:52,499 --> 00:14:55,181
I did this with a group of
actors in Williamstown.

191
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:56,982
It was transformational.

192
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,387
I perm?tanmelo.

193
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:03,309
It is the return in a day or two.

194
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,032
I make a quick call.

195
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,447
Sarah, I am.

196
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:21,848
Do not hang up.

197
00:15:22,768 --> 00:15:24,451
I'm around.
I'm in a Play.

198
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,974
Where it acts
your mom. How about?

199
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,740
All right...

200
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:36,864
It will be difficult to locate me ...

201
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:39,546
but actually
I want to come see you soon.

202
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,073
Honey, do not mean that.

203
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:52,160
I never want to be a father to you.

204
00:15:54,641 --> 00:15:56,083
Now it's different.

205
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,444
Sarah?

206
00:15:59,286 --> 00:16:00,608
Sarah?

207
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,899
She reconsider.

208
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:18,026
- When we release?
- When we are ready.

209
00:16:19,866 --> 00:16:23,911
Is there no scheduled presentations?

210
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:28,477
When we are ready
to act, we will act.

211
00:16:30,158 --> 00:16:33,042
This is not working for me.

212
00:16:33,121 --> 00:16:34,962
Can you return my
phone, please?

213
00:16:36,323 --> 00:16:37,844
A moment please.

214
00:16:37,885 --> 00:16:40,128
Is that work?

215
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,890
Stay, John.

216
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:44,492
We need you.

217
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:46,655
I need you.

218
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:50,299
I never want to touch him.

219
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,500
Once it is enough for you.

220
00:16:52,539 --> 00:16:54,622
It looks very old.

221
00:16:54,703 --> 00:16:56,304
It is.

222
00:16:59,387 --> 00:17:04,673
Are you open to improvisation?
Because I like to.

223
00:17:04,752 --> 00:17:07,156
He had a gay partner.
I learned some things.

224
00:17:07,437 --> 00:17:11,680
There is room for improvisation, but
the story always ends the same.

225
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:13,682
- What is it about?
- It's a love story.

226
00:17:15,404 --> 00:17:16,605
Are not all are?

227
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:21,210
And the tragedy. Thus ends the love.

228
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,852
That's depressing.

229
00:17:24,214 --> 00:17:28,538
Kantemir, a village in
outside Bucharest.

230
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:30,980
- What is that?
- Romania.

231
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,862
1810.

232
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:35,865
A plague ravaged the country ...

233
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:37,907
killing nobles
and beggars alike.
2. 3. 4
00: 17: 38.147 -> 00: 17: 41.591
He, a humble band of gypsies ...

235
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:44,400
life as an actor is earned.

236
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:49,039
She, the daughter of an ambitious merchant.

237
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,160
They fall in love.

238
00:17:53,563 --> 00:17:55,965
A convicted and troubled romance.

239
00:17:56,045 --> 00:17:58,009
Peter Kirakovsky ...

240
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:02,773
controller, demanding a sociopath.

241
00:18:04,454 --> 00:18:10,221
You plan to marry your beautiful
daughter Wanda in royalty.

242
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,023
You are a liar, manipulator ...

243
00:18:14,063 --> 00:18:16,306
killer.

244
00:18:16,546 --> 00:18:18,950
A collection of defects
deepest of man.

245
00:18:24,595 --> 00:18:27,799
Natasha Kirakovsky, the
Peter obedient wife.

246
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,120
Your youthful dreams of happiness
They crumble in your wedding night ...

247
00:18:31,161 --> 00:18:35,125
when your husband
you whipped for your pleasure.

248
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,650
In your heart,
you want to fight him.

249
00:18:43,013 --> 00:18:44,656
But you're a coward.

250
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:55,307
Heinrich Otto, the strong arm of Peter.

251
00:18:56,187 --> 00:18:57,868
You're a bully irrational.

252
00:18:57,908 --> 00:19:00,311
Just think of bloodshed.

253
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,714
A stab wound
I left with a severe limp.

254
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:05,196
You use it to your advantage.

255
00:19:05,236 --> 00:19:08,920
People believe that the
disabled are useless ...

256
00:19:08,954 --> 00:19:10,682
but you're lethal.

257
00:19:13,244 --> 00:19:15,286
Debra Marie.

258
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,971
Wanda friend say you are ...

259
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:22,934
but you're just
an opportunistic slut.

260
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:27,138
You'll do anything for
ingratiate Wanda's father.

261
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,103
But your greed and bad intentions ...

262
00:19:33,745 --> 00:19:36,029
will be your ruin.

263
00:19:39,192 --> 00:19:41,112
Buchaccio.

264
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:43,596
Chef Peter and Natasha.

265
00:19:45,238 --> 00:19:47,439
You once said something reckless ...

266
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:51,763
and now you follow
Peter like a dog.

267
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:55,928
And you will die like the bastard you are.

268
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:07,100
Wanda Kirakovsky.

269
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:11,903
Together we dream of escaping ...

270
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:16,148
living today in the
scene, traveling the world.

271
00:20:18,752 --> 00:20:23,716
You do not have sin
one without a defect.

272
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:26,399
Pure in every sense of the word.

273
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:30,524
We are one soul ...

274
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,407
a life.

275
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:39,173
But you stole everything.

276
00:20:40,534 --> 00:20:44,698
Ten. Feel your memories.

277
00:20:44,737 --> 00:20:46,099
Do not touch it.

278
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,501
And proteges.

279
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,825
This will make the
things interesting.

280
00:20:53,147 --> 00:20:54,428
Wendy, no.

281
00:21:05,518 --> 00:21:07,080
See?

282
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:11,966
Nicholas!

283
00:21:12,006 --> 00:21:14,809
I warn you. Leave her alone.

284
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,411
You always say that.

285
00:21:17,491 --> 00:21:19,613
- John.
- Shut.

286
00:21:24,498 --> 00:21:26,701
I'm sorry. I do not know what happened.

287
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:28,703
It's not me.

288
00:21:28,783 --> 00:21:30,985
Yes you are, John.

289
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:32,427
Are you.

290
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:41,057
Heaven.

291
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,119
You will not be found anywhere.

292
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:48,745
You should recede.

293
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:50,667
He is furious.

294
00:22:50,746 --> 00:22:53,269
That's the least of my worries.

295
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,912
It will be if the rope breaks.

296
00:22:55,953 --> 00:22:58,276
That will be the destination.

297
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,001
I'm glad to see you.

298
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,368
I need your help, John.

299
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:13,531
- Put an end to their suffering.
- Than?

300
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:17,615
Can not you see that you are suffering?

301
00:23:17,655 --> 00:23:19,454
I do not think that's ...

302
00:23:19,537 --> 00:23:21,377
A merciful death, John.

303
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:24,461
I can not stop it.

304
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:26,263
But you can.

305
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,225
I wish I could ...

306
00:23:28,305 --> 00:23:30,468
I wish I could help you, but ...

307
00:23:35,353 --> 00:23:38,595
Nicholas, listen, I ...

308
00:23:38,675 --> 00:23:41,399
I want to thank you for
giving me a chance.

309
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:43,199
I know that today my
name is tainted ...

310
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:47,845
and I promise you I will work
hard for you in this work.

311
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:50,207
Yeah, I guess you feel
the need to redeem yourself.

312
00:23:50,241 --> 00:23:52,771
Sorry?

313
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:55,534
You've been stuck in a
destructive cycle, right?

314
00:23:55,574 --> 00:23:58,415
How many times were you
in rehab?

315
00:23:58,455 --> 00:23:59,414
Four, right?

316
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,221
So why you hired me?

317
00:24:04,261 --> 00:24:05,544
I need a good villain.

318
00:24:05,623 --> 00:24:09,113
Well that is not the
character description.

319
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:12,270
Would you have done the work if you
who would you interpret that?

320
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:17,675
I bet you are
tired of playing the bad.

321
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:21,039
So we lied
my agent and me?

322
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,843
John, accepted the
paper without reading the play.

323
00:24:24,876 --> 00:24:28,607
But I think you're the perfect person.

324
00:24:29,408 --> 00:24:31,611
I count on you to
give your full potential.

325
00:24:33,853 --> 00:24:35,894
What about the animals?

326
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,696
Help him or leave.

327
00:24:37,736 --> 00:24:39,257
There's nothing I can do.

328
00:24:39,337 --> 00:24:41,539
I'll be rehearsing with Wendy.

329
00:24:59,437 --> 00:25:00,959
Let's sit down.

330
00:25:05,164 --> 00:25:08,848
It is you, the actor.

331
00:25:08,888 --> 00:25:10,891
The Gypsy.

332
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:16,256
But how did you know
who I am and where I live?

333
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:17,497
I asked.

334
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,509
I must admit,
I was very excited...

335
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:32,393
to have another chance
talking to you.

336
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:33,953
Do you mind my company?

337
00:25:33,994 --> 00:25:35,716
Not at all.

338
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:39,319
But my father ...

339
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,483
I understand.

340
00:25:43,523 --> 00:25:45,565
I'm a gypsy.

341
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:47,207
You should know my place.

342
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:49,891
Goodbye.

343
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:52,332
No, wait.

344
00:25:52,572 --> 00:25:53,894
Wait.
3. 4. 5
00: 25: 54.855 -> 00: 25: 56.415
Help me with this.

346
00:25:58,618 --> 00:25:59,739
What are you doing?

347
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,663
I go to a more private place.

348
00:26:03,584 --> 00:26:04,506
You do not have to do it.

349
00:26:04,546 --> 00:26:06,707
Last night you were
fabulous on stage.

350
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,831
I felt that for me were acting alone.

351
00:26:10,912 --> 00:26:14,915
Well ... Once I saw your eyes, it was so.

352
00:26:22,923 --> 00:26:24,886
Fabulous.

353
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,412
Rasgu?aste like a thorn.

354
00:26:31,452 --> 00:26:34,414
It is a small price
pay to see you smile.

355
00:26:34,495 --> 00:26:35,896
Ven.

356
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:57,920
They're beautiful, right?

357
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,801
They are very friendly.

358
00:27:00,442 --> 00:27:01,724
Come on.

359
00:27:01,764 --> 00:27:04,165
I've never ridden a horse.

360
00:27:04,245 --> 00:27:05,848
It is easy.

361
00:27:06,848 --> 00:27:10,691
Look, you just have to hold on to me.
I will do all the work.

362
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:14,816
I promise you I will
anything happen.

363
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,343
Wendy! Where are you going?

364
00:27:23,345 --> 00:27:26,669
Do you get on a motorcycle
with someone you hardly know?

365
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,631
You should think about it.

366
00:27:30,552 --> 00:27:32,033
Will you accept it?

367
00:27:32,114 --> 00:27:34,757
It is a drunk rundown.

368
00:27:34,797 --> 00:27:36,879
People make fun of him behind his back.

369
00:27:38,881 --> 00:27:40,202
They laugh.

370
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:47,410
That was the Work.

371
00:27:47,489 --> 00:27:51,133
You did not believe it
I meant, right?

372
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,019
Well, Johnnie, you win.

373
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,782
I'll take a walk
another day, right?

374
00:27:59,782 --> 00:28:01,743
I'll see others.

375
00:28:02,906 --> 00:28:05,148
I see you then, Wanda.

376
00:28:08,031 --> 00:28:12,075
I would not do that, get on
a motorcycle with a stranger.

377
00:28:12,155 --> 00:28:13,796
Usually not.

378
00:28:14,998 --> 00:28:16,839
This place does not feel normal.

379
00:28:16,879 --> 00:28:19,843
It's so different from what
I'm used to.

380
00:28:19,876 --> 00:28:22,085
Its beautiful...

381
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,649
exciting ...

382
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,331
And dangerous.

383
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:32,416
You mean this place or to Nicholas?

384
00:28:34,378 --> 00:28:36,780
Just use your
Common sense, right?

385
00:28:36,861 --> 00:28:38,262
Thank you.

386
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:41,305
You are welcome.

387
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:43,147
Come on.

388
00:28:43,227 --> 00:28:44,668
Let's go for a coffee.

389
00:29:02,846 --> 00:29:04,890
Hello.

390
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:10,735
I decided to give you one last chance.

391
00:29:14,179 --> 00:29:16,141
You're drunk, Allison.

392
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,702
And excited.

393
00:29:17,742 --> 00:29:20,184
Look...

394
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:22,147
I've been there.

395
00:29:22,187 --> 00:29:23,989
Need help.

396
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:26,150
I can give you some
numbers if desired.

397
00:29:26,189 --> 00:29:28,753
Are you going to scold me or catch me?

398
00:29:29,955 --> 00:29:31,516
Please leave.

399
00:29:31,555 --> 00:29:33,398
You know what I long to do?

400
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,561
Than?

401
00:29:35,642 --> 00:29:38,243
Call those tabloids
tabloid ...

402
00:29:38,283 --> 00:29:41,406
and tell them how John Larousse
angry again.

403
00:29:43,488 --> 00:29:45,169
Maybe you invent something.

404
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:48,493
Maybe they get paid much.

405
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:50,696
I am yesterday's news.

406
00:29:50,776 --> 00:29:52,658
Then I'll do it for spite.

407
00:29:57,903 --> 00:30:00,385
Get away from my way, innate village.

408
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:02,269
I need fresh air.

409
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,112
Do not worry about it, Mr. Kirakovsky.

410
00:30:07,192 --> 00:30:09,153
I'll take care of it.

411
00:30:10,315 --> 00:30:11,838
Than?

412
00:30:12,959 --> 00:30:14,640
It will be a pleasure.

413
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:16,242
?Lars?

414
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,126
?Lars?

415
00:30:34,221 --> 00:30:36,263
Hello Beautiful.

416
00:31:48,855 --> 00:31:49,936
Allison!

417
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:52,901
Allison!

418
00:31:56,424 --> 00:31:57,866
Allison!

419
00:31:59,587 --> 00:32:00,748
Allison!

420
00:32:13,763 --> 00:32:15,203
Do not.

421
00:32:15,244 --> 00:32:16,805
OMG.

422
00:32:16,886 --> 00:32:18,206
?Allison?

423
00:32:33,262 --> 00:32:35,984
Listen to me. I know what I saw.

424
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:39,349
His body is in the
half a kilometer forest.

425
00:32:39,588 --> 00:32:42,832
We need flashlights and
Somebody call the police.

426
00:32:42,872 --> 00:32:44,592
John, stop.

427
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:47,716
Allison took a movie.
I had to let him go, that's all.

428
00:32:47,755 --> 00:32:49,319
Good for her.

429
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:51,401
He said he received a call.

430
00:32:52,322 --> 00:32:55,005
We may find
someone to replace her.

431
00:32:55,044 --> 00:32:56,046
He did it.

432
00:32:56,126 --> 00:32:58,047
Just a moment. Said
the dog did it.

433
00:32:58,087 --> 00:33:01,450
Yeah, yeah, okay. The dog
they wanted me to kill him.

434
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,852
You smell like liquor.

435
00:33:03,934 --> 00:33:05,695
Someone poured liquor on me.

436
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,657
Who?

437
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:09,819
Just give me the damn phone.

438
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:10,981
Do not.

439
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:13,421
Allison's room is empty.
They are not your bags.

440
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:16,304
But I found this in
John's room.

441
00:33:16,345 --> 00:33:19,269
- Do you mind if I serve?
- Rebecca, I swear to God ...

442
00:33:19,309 --> 00:33:22,432
Be glad I went.
You got along poorly.

443
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:27,637
You know, no matter what everyone thinks.

444
00:33:27,677 --> 00:33:29,159
Does not matter.

445
00:33:29,199 --> 00:33:31,601
I bring you back if necessary.

446
00:33:32,522 --> 00:33:34,405
Damn liar.

447
00:33:34,444 --> 00:33:36,966
John, stop. All go together.

448
00:33:37,207 --> 00:33:40,371
- That is better?
- Yes.

449
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:50,421
It's cold out here.
Anybody got colder?

450
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:51,983
My legs are two ice cubes.

451
00:33:52,022 --> 00:33:54,825
- Shut up, Brad.
- It's okay.

452
00:33:54,865 --> 00:33:56,185
John, with all due respect ...

453
00:33:56,426 --> 00:33:58,829
but this bottle was
almost empty when I found her.

454
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:00,791
- You're drunk.
- Shut.

455
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,553
I'm sober and here we are.

456
00:34:02,632 --> 00:34:04,355
It is next to this tree.

457
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:10,921
I was here.

458
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:14,805
I see nothing, John.

459
00:34:17,127 --> 00:34:18,769
Where did you hide?

460
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:25,537
You know, right?

461
00:34:26,538 --> 00:34:27,698
You helped.

462
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:30,381
Your accusations are boring drunk.

463
00:34:30,461 --> 00:34:34,146
I do not know what your game,
Nicholas, but I will not tolerate it.

464
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,751
Come on, guys, let's go inside.

465
00:34:42,874 --> 00:34:44,156
Ven.

466
00:34:44,396 --> 00:34:45,837
Enfr?es not want you.

467
00:35:22,474 --> 00:35:23,836
Thirsty?

468
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:27,319
Come on, John, do not be like that.

469
00:35:29,923 --> 00:35:31,884
Look...

470
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:34,647
I really need you.

471
00:35:34,727 --> 00:35:37,250
I wanted you to be the
first to play the role.

472
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,410
Act One of Kantemir.

473
00:35:40,132 --> 00:35:42,455
I hope you're ready for
test tomorrow morning.

474
00:35:42,535 --> 00:35:45,138
So let me read your work.

475
00:35:46,379 --> 00:35:47,782
I do not think so.

476
00:36:15,368 --> 00:36:16,931
What is this?

477
00:36:16,971 --> 00:36:18,292
My damn.

478
00:36:19,532 --> 00:36:21,615
Help me, John.

479
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:24,779
Save me.

480
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,623
- Kill me.
- Than?

481
00:36:40,715 --> 00:36:41,957
Interesting day.

482
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,321
You're a very interesting man.

483
00:36:50,845 --> 00:36:53,328
I'm anxious to see
what holds for us tomorrow.

484
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:57,212
Good evening.

485
00:36:58,052 --> 00:37:00,175
I'm hungry.

486
00:38:27,183 --> 00:38:30,586
You have been drinking ... Last night?

487
00:38:30,667 --> 00:38:33,150
- Were you drunk?
- Do not.

488
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,513
But I feel that I have
a terrible hangover.

489
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,079
Than?

490
00:38:41,158 --> 00:38:42,799
Come on.

491
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:45,721
I've been sober for almost three months.

492
00:38:45,802 --> 00:38:47,444
Almost?

493
00:38:47,524 --> 00:38:50,327
Well, nine weeks.

494
00:38:50,407 --> 00:38:52,609
I rounded it.

495
00:38:52,649 --> 00:38:56,052
Perhaps abstinence,
why you think you saw something.

496
00:38:56,132 --> 00:38:59,416
Rebecca, what I saw was real.

497
00:38:59,497 --> 00:39:01,138
She was dead.

498
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,662
If Nicholas was
our phones ...

499
00:39:04,702 --> 00:39:07,184
Allison knew how
They gave him a movie?

500
00:39:07,464 --> 00:39:08,625
How could he know?

501
00:39:08,706 --> 00:39:10,587
Perhaps he answered his phone.

502
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:12,590
She was waiting for the call.

503
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:17,115
John ...

504
00:39:17,194 --> 00:39:20,078
You know how it makes you look.

505
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:23,962
If you come to know that
I was fired from here ...

506
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:28,206
if people believe that
you can not do a work ...

507
00:39:28,246 --> 00:39:29,848
the paper will not save your career.

508
00:39:29,927 --> 00:39:33,812
But if you replaced,
It will ruin what's left of you.

509
00:39:40,338 --> 00:39:42,259
You were always good at giving advice.

510
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:44,342
And you were always wrong follow.

511
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:48,747
What is that?

512
00:39:50,949 --> 00:39:53,591
- You must make you see.
- Yes.

513
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,073
Now you are a dermatologist?

514
00:39:55,154 --> 00:39:56,515
A psychologist?

515
00:39:56,554 --> 00:39:58,075
How many more "?logas" I need?

516
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:00,719
You could list, but
we would be here long.

517
00:40:03,722 --> 00:40:08,085
Hey, could you read the first act?

518
00:40:08,166 --> 00:40:09,288
Yes.

519
00:40:10,929 --> 00:40:15,054
Allison's character dies
raise the curtain on the first act.

520
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:16,736
The character of Lars killed.

521
00:40:16,816 --> 00:40:17,777
Y?

522
00:40:17,817 --> 00:40:22,619
He killed her in the forest such
like what happened last night.

523
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,624
Nothing happened last night.

524
00:40:26,504 --> 00:40:28,628
Yes good.

525
00:40:28,707 --> 00:40:30,310
How about this?

526
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:35,514
My character Wendy warns
go riding with Nicholas.

527
00:40:35,795 --> 00:40:39,797
Exactly the same happened
last night, but with a motorcycle.

528
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:42,881
What do you say? Are we living the Work?

529
00:40:44,002 --> 00:40:45,805
Listen to yourself.

530
00:40:47,727 --> 00:40:49,009
You need help, Peter.

531
00:40:49,889 --> 00:40:51,530
John.

532
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,174
It is Peter in the Work.

533
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:06,225
Not so bad, you know?

534
00:41:06,266 --> 00:41:08,148
You scared me.

535
00:41:08,188 --> 00:41:10,671
If you like to
you gave it a try.

536
00:41:11,992 --> 00:41:15,756
Someone was murdered here last night
and it seems that nobody cares.

537
00:41:16,397 --> 00:41:18,397
Are you sure?

538
00:41:22,002 --> 00:41:23,883
You should trust him.

539
00:41:24,926 --> 00:41:27,247
Do you know how long 24 hours,?

540
00:41:27,288 --> 00:41:29,930
I feel much longer.

541
00:41:30,931 --> 00:41:34,094
What do you want? My permission
to go with Nicholas?

542
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:36,536
I'm not your father.

543
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:38,578
He just wants me to be happy.

544
00:41:41,581 --> 00:41:44,184
I understand. I see what you're doing.

545
00:41:44,265 --> 00:41:45,867
Act Two, right?

546
00:41:45,907 --> 00:41:47,468
Here. Let's see.

547
00:41:49,148 --> 00:41:51,312
Page 28.

548
00:41:51,351 --> 00:41:52,914
You say, "I just want to be happy."

549
00:41:52,955 --> 00:41:56,677
I say: "He's a gypsy.

550
00:41:57,678 --> 00:41:59,559
They carry plague.

551
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,203
And you, my child, will not see him.

552
00:42:03,282 --> 00:42:08,569
If you do, it will be the last
Once you see your gypsy. "

553
00:42:09,852 --> 00:42:12,094
You would not.

554
00:42:12,134 --> 00:42:13,855
Ten.

555
00:42:13,935 --> 00:42:14,936
Better yet.

556
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,860
Have this.

557
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,462
It will protect you.

558
00:42:27,789 --> 00:42:30,111
Wendy.

559
00:42:30,152 --> 00:42:32,194
Wendy, look at me.

560
00:42:34,035 --> 00:42:35,435
Affection.

561
00:42:36,397 --> 00:42:39,160
It is not the memory.

562
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,604
Is the collar, you
He liked in the train station.

563
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:44,566
You remember?

564
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:46,087
?Wendy?

565
00:42:48,531 --> 00:42:50,333
I love him, Father.

566
00:42:51,894 --> 00:42:53,455
?Wendy?

567
00:42:54,417 --> 00:42:57,499
Wendy, is only a
damn Play.

568
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,940
Wendy!

569
00:43:13,516 --> 00:43:16,478
When you two
They became so gentle?

570
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,520
Peter, you must calm down.

571
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:21,323
Not Peter. John.

572
00:43:21,363 --> 00:43:23,767
You are Rebecca, I'm John.

573
00:43:23,847 --> 00:43:25,168
Our daughter is Sarah.

574
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:28,091
She hates me and you
He wants you. Do you understand?

575
00:43:28,171 --> 00:43:29,932
I know.

576
00:43:29,973 --> 00:43:32,055
I got tired. I'm outta here.

577
00:44:00,484 --> 00:44:02,246
I need the keys
of the truck, Brad.

578
00:44:04,368 --> 00:44:05,530
Keys.

579
00:44:08,372 --> 00:44:10,573
What, no more silly jokes?

580
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,295
Is the mouse got your tongue?

581
00:44:14,937 --> 00:44:17,701
Wendy, we must leave now.

582
00:44:18,542 --> 00:44:20,024
I can not.

583
00:44:20,064 --> 00:44:21,626
Your eyes.

584
00:44:23,867 --> 00:44:26,710
Your eyes were green
like my daughter.

585
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,631
Now they are blue.

586
00:44:27,672 --> 00:44:30,475
- There have always been blue.
- Do not.

587
00:44:30,515 --> 00:44:33,397
Yesterday they were green.

588
00:44:33,477 --> 00:44:35,119
They were green yesterday.

589
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:40,764
I not think I should leave.

590
00:44:42,928 --> 00:44:45,490
I knew you'd feel that way.

591
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:48,012
You should stay, Mr. Kirakovsky.

592
00:44:48,254 --> 00:44:50,575
That's not my name, Lars.

593
00:44:53,297 --> 00:44:55,058
You can not leave.

594
00:44:56,221 --> 00:44:58,985
Not until the story is finished.

595
00:46:17,865 --> 00:46:19,225
Act Two.

596
00:46:21,789 --> 00:46:24,350
The good news keep coming.

597
00:46:26,593 --> 00:46:28,515
Look, there is no electricity.

598
00:46:28,555 --> 00:46:31,038
That lamp was not even here.

599
00:46:31,118 --> 00:46:33,519
At the front gate says "Kantemir".

600
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,281
That was not when we arrived.

601
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:39,648
These games Theatre, this
He has surpassed those games.

602
00:46:39,727 --> 00:46:41,649
This quarter has always been the same.

603
00:46:41,689 --> 00:46:43,171
No, not you.

604
00:46:45,613 --> 00:46:47,054
Rebecca, sorry.

605
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:51,618
Look, you have not been paying attention. I do.

606
00:46:53,299 --> 00:46:54,742
- It's bigger.
- Than?

607
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:01,709
Rebecca.

608
00:47:01,749 --> 00:47:05,833
Read the description of Peter
Kirakovsky in the list of characters.

609
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:12,881
Piercing eyes, intellect
sharp and strong physical bearing.

610
00:47:12,921 --> 00:47:16,483
A jagged scar
down to his cheek.

611
00:47:16,564 --> 00:47:18,767
Now do I think?

612
00:47:19,728 --> 00:47:22,492
Do not? What about the small Brad?

613
00:47:22,531 --> 00:47:24,932
Sputtering not all the time.

614
00:47:24,972 --> 00:47:26,254
He believed to be Buchaccio.

615
00:47:26,294 --> 00:47:28,336
No, that is nonsense.

616
00:47:28,576 --> 00:47:30,018
Look at my face, Rebecca.

617
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:31,939
Look around.

618
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:34,782
He has changed. Is different.

619
00:47:38,507 --> 00:47:40,750
We must seek to Nicholas.

620
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:42,431
We must look now.

621
00:47:47,795 --> 00:47:49,877
Act Two, Scene One.

622
00:47:51,321 --> 00:47:53,602
"Peter discovers
Nicholas near the barn. "

623
00:47:56,886 --> 00:47:58,527
"I warned you to stay away.

624
00:47:58,606 --> 00:48:00,489
Lower Horse ".

625
00:48:00,568 --> 00:48:03,812
"Nicholas smiled.'ll
to catch me first. "

626
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:05,774
Nicholas.

627
00:48:06,015 --> 00:48:07,416
Peter.

628
00:48:07,456 --> 00:48:09,458
This is the scene where you persecuting me.

629
00:48:09,499 --> 00:48:12,060
I'm not here to rehearse.
I talk to Allison.

630
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,703
I thought that we had already settled.

631
00:48:13,783 --> 00:48:17,066
Do I believe that is
filming at any location?

632
00:48:18,027 --> 00:48:19,789
I want to see the script.

633
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:23,312
- Do you want to see it?
- Yes.

634
00:48:23,872 --> 00:48:25,314
Come & Get It.

635
00:48:32,001 --> 00:48:33,923
Peter rides his
horse and chases ...

636
00:48:33,963 --> 00:48:36,165
fast approaching.

637
00:48:46,455 --> 00:48:50,620
Peter yells: Stay away
my daughter or I'll kill you ...

638
00:48:51,622 --> 00:48:54,304
"Can you try
get me. "Nicholas responds ...

639
00:48:54,344 --> 00:48:56,466
"But you never put
end our love. "

640
00:49:02,672 --> 00:49:05,115
Peter furiously
whips his horse.

641
00:49:12,442 --> 00:49:14,684
The lawn is covered
dew and his horse falls.

642
00:49:16,246 --> 00:49:18,049
Natasha hears screaming.

643
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:20,010
Peter.

644
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:26,336
John.

645
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:27,377
John!

646
00:49:28,819 --> 00:49:30,060
John.

647
00:49:30,981 --> 00:49:32,904
Care.

648
00:49:32,944 --> 00:49:34,826
Get out of me.

649
00:49:34,906 --> 00:49:36,387
John.

650
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:42,553
John, you're not Peter.
You're not yourself.

651
00:49:43,674 --> 00:49:45,035
John.

652
00:49:53,003 --> 00:49:56,088
I'll take care of
However, Mr. Kirakovsky.

653
00:49:57,008 --> 00:49:59,489
So what are you waiting for?

654
00:50:16,588 --> 00:50:17,951
What happen?

655
00:50:23,835 --> 00:50:25,276
Your father.

656
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,965
We checked in three
days to escape the plague.

657
00:50:33,645 --> 00:50:35,207
And me?

658
00:50:35,286 --> 00:50:37,449
This has nothing to do with you.

659
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:41,172
The pest has been here for months.

660
00:50:41,212 --> 00:50:44,777
It's me who is away from you ...

661
00:50:44,857 --> 00:50:46,379
no plague.

662
00:50:46,459 --> 00:50:48,261
It's just your excuse.

663
00:50:52,624 --> 00:50:54,707
Let's run away together.

664
00:50:56,909 --> 00:51:00,352
We can travel through the countryside
acting in plays.

665
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,755
We can write our history
and act for ourselves.

666
00:51:16,569 --> 00:51:20,172
"Heinrich travels to camp
Gypsy to kill Nicholas.

667
00:51:20,253 --> 00:51:22,336
It is a fight breaks out and kill Heinrich. "

668
00:51:22,375 --> 00:51:24,217
He will be next.

669
00:51:24,258 --> 00:51:26,019
Lars.

670
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:27,741
You hit your head.

671
00:51:27,781 --> 00:51:29,624
You must sit, Peter.

672
00:51:33,386 --> 00:51:36,309
No, I ... I must stop Nicholas.

673
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:37,830
He is a good man, Peter.

674
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:39,352
Rebecca ...

675
00:51:48,963 --> 00:51:50,243
Natasha ...

676
00:51:52,246 --> 00:51:54,648
do not put me to the test, wife.

677
00:51:54,688 --> 00:51:56,490
Tell me now.

678
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:00,573
Where is the gypsy camp?

679
00:52:01,935 --> 00:52:04,498
Where will you meet?

680
00:52:09,864 --> 00:52:11,586
What do we have here?

681
00:52:12,948 --> 00:52:14,947
Heinrich, no. What my
father has said, no ...

682
00:52:15,028 --> 00:52:16,310
Do not you want to see.

683
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:22,837
You do not have to do this.

684
00:52:23,518 --> 00:52:25,920
Do not do it! Do not! Do not!

685
00:52:31,086 --> 00:52:32,286
I will not leave you.

686
00:52:33,486 --> 00:52:35,009
That makes?

687
00:52:41,055 --> 00:52:42,097
Do not!

688
00:53:03,038 --> 00:53:04,679
It's not your scene, John!

689
00:53:04,759 --> 00:53:05,962
Go away!

690
00:53:07,483 --> 00:53:09,566
What we're doing?

691
00:53:09,605 --> 00:53:11,568
I do not do anything!

692
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:12,847
Now, go away!

693
00:53:32,988 --> 00:53:34,510
We killed him.

694
00:53:37,433 --> 00:53:38,475
You go home.

695
00:53:39,596 --> 00:53:41,637
Act as if nothing had happened.

696
00:53:41,678 --> 00:53:43,278
They'll think I killed him.

697
00:53:45,563 --> 00:53:47,123
I will leave ...

698
00:53:48,004 --> 00:53:49,166
tonight.

699
00:53:50,406 --> 00:53:52,167
I will not leave you.

700
00:53:52,248 --> 00:53:54,090
Look...

701
00:53:55,972 --> 00:53:58,093
if we get caught, we're dead.

702
00:53:58,334 --> 00:54:00,497
So we will flee together.

703
00:54:01,698 --> 00:54:03,540
They never find us.

704
00:54:05,621 --> 00:54:08,505
Promise me you'll never leave me.

705
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,466
Promise me you'll always be together.

706
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:12,989
I swear.

707
00:54:13,028 --> 00:54:14,792
I swear by my life.

708
00:54:36,294 --> 00:54:38,054
Lars is dead.

709
00:54:39,015 --> 00:54:40,298
Leave that drink.

710
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,981
Peter.

711
00:54:44,021 --> 00:54:46,424
John, damn it.

712
00:54:46,464 --> 00:54:48,746
You can not prevent
she loves Nicholas.

713
00:54:48,826 --> 00:54:52,229
Your alcoholism ruin your
happiness, as ruined mine.

714
00:54:58,235 --> 00:55:01,279
Rebecca, I am.

715
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:04,203
Please come with me.

716
00:55:04,283 --> 00:55:06,524
- Please.
- Where?

717
00:55:06,564 --> 00:55:09,606
We must read the whole script.

718
00:55:09,687 --> 00:55:13,011
If somehow we are
living his damn work ...

719
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,693
we need to read the end.

720
00:55:14,773 --> 00:55:18,536
If we die in history,
really die.

721
00:55:18,577 --> 00:55:20,979
You're drunk, Peter.

722
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:23,261
I got to lose.

723
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:28,987
Peter no!

724
00:55:30,188 --> 00:55:31,189
Father. Do not.

725
00:55:31,269 --> 00:55:34,352
You will have done something. All of us.

726
00:55:39,238 --> 00:55:40,439
Hello, Peter.

727
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,121
Catch it.

728
00:55:45,364 --> 00:55:49,006
You're ahead. Does not matter.

729
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:52,370
I'm not here to
testing a fight scene.

730
00:55:53,811 --> 00:55:55,054
Even you are not in your character.

731
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,538
I'm impressed.

732
00:55:58,617 --> 00:56:00,699
Nobody could fight
against it so long.

733
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:05,745
Perhaps the end is not so
questionable as I thought.

734
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:08,067
I'm here to see the script.

735
00:56:08,106 --> 00:56:10,309
No, John.

736
00:56:10,349 --> 00:56:12,752
This is the part where
you you challenge me to a duel.

737
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:15,274
There will be no duel.

738
00:56:16,195 --> 00:56:17,716
Do not hurt him.

739
00:56:18,677 --> 00:56:20,760
He'll kill you, Peter.

740
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:24,483
Rebecca, I'm John, for God's sake.

741
00:56:27,367 --> 00:56:29,247
I will not kill you.

742
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:30,731
Not yet.

743
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:33,052
There can not be a hero without a villain.

744
00:56:34,093 --> 00:56:35,816
I'm not the villain.

745
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:39,859
You are always the villain.

746
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:44,865
How you longed represent
hero and here you are again.

747
00:56:44,904 --> 00:56:46,985
There was nothing that
you could do about it.

748
00:56:47,066 --> 00:56:48,788
Nothing.

749
00:56:48,868 --> 00:56:50,309
Nothing?

750
00:56:55,956 --> 00:56:57,117
I'm disappointed.

751
00:56:57,158 --> 00:56:59,199
You're an excellent swordsman in the Work.

752
00:57:05,645 --> 00:57:07,888
Fight it all you want.
We're just puppets.

753
00:57:07,928 --> 00:57:09,570
Why did you ask me to kill you?

754
00:57:10,491 --> 00:57:12,372
What do you think was the dog?

755
00:57:12,453 --> 00:57:13,894
I was testing you.

756
00:57:18,339 --> 00:57:20,141
Come on, Peter.

757
00:57:20,221 --> 00:57:22,143
Stay in character.

758
00:57:34,876 --> 00:57:36,718
Kill me.

759
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:38,961
If you kill me, you'll be free.

760
00:57:39,201 --> 00:57:40,482
Your freedom is all that I have.

761
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:47,568
OMG.

762
00:57:47,808 --> 00:57:48,930
Who did this?

763
00:57:50,732 --> 00:57:54,095
Come on, Peter. Do it. Just me.

764
00:57:54,176 --> 00:57:55,858
- Why?
- Just me.

765
00:57:55,938 --> 00:57:58,659
- Why?
- Listen to me, Peter.

766
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,861
You have to kill me.

767
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:04,345
- Stop fighting with me and listen.
- Wont let me.

768
00:58:04,385 --> 00:58:08,190
- Bring the book.
- How do you think this is all about?

769
00:58:08,229 --> 00:58:11,273
Kill me, my torment ends.

770
00:58:12,314 --> 00:58:14,316
Come on, Peter, do it.

771
00:58:14,397 --> 00:58:16,798
Just me.
It does not allow me to do it.

772
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:21,123
You are crazy.

773
00:58:22,084 --> 00:58:24,325
What the hell are you?

774
00:58:26,927 --> 00:58:28,730
Wanda brings the book.

775
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:30,333
Wendy, no!

776
00:58:38,421 --> 00:58:39,742
I give it.

777
00:58:41,863 --> 00:58:43,945
You want answers?

778
00:58:43,985 --> 00:58:45,066
I will give you.

779
00:58:46,629 --> 00:58:48,350
Touch it, John.

780
00:58:51,474 --> 00:58:54,117
Wanda's father,
Peter, was so angry ...

781
00:58:54,158 --> 00:58:57,201
he killed her when he returned
barn that night.

782
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,123
Then I killed him in a duel.

783
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:05,248
Hui, a man wanted to
nothing except his memory live ...

784
00:59:05,288 --> 00:59:09,052
and in the desperate hope
to resurrect somehow.

785
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,942
But there was a way.

786
00:59:11,975 --> 00:59:14,258
It was a way to give it back.

787
00:59:14,297 --> 00:59:19,062
There was a man in the old
Gypsies called Osferoff stories.

788
00:59:19,142 --> 00:59:22,346
They said he had lived a thousand years ...

789
00:59:22,385 --> 00:59:24,907
and was
made of blood and magic.

790
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:28,112
I looked at the
deep forest ...

791
00:59:28,151 --> 00:59:31,795
and I brought the Work
I wrote about our tragedy.

792
00:59:32,676 --> 00:59:34,598
He knew I would
I was going to do the work.

793
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,681
Wanda knew all about.

794
00:59:39,643 --> 00:59:41,165
His beauty ...

795
00:59:42,725 --> 00:59:44,047
his innocence ...

796
00:59:45,489 --> 00:59:47,251
our love...

797
00:59:54,138 --> 00:59:55,219
his death.

798
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:58,542
Death.

799
00:59:58,622 --> 01:00:00,784
It would any
thing back to life.

800
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:09,513
I said I wanted to be
with her forever.

801
01:00:11,395 --> 01:00:13,758
"Forever is a long time," he said.

802
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:19,524
"Are you sure what
Is this what you want?. "

803
01:00:20,604 --> 01:00:22,566
"More than anything," I said.

804
01:00:23,647 --> 01:00:26,771
"More than anything in this
Earth and beyond. "

805
01:00:27,692 --> 01:00:29,494
He nodded ...

806
01:00:29,574 --> 01:00:32,498
and said he would grant me my wish.

807
01:00:35,259 --> 01:00:38,143
All that remained was the price.

808
01:00:46,512 --> 01:00:48,794
Osteroff fulfilled his end of the bargain.

809
01:00:50,315 --> 01:00:53,719
I spend eternity
living our history ...

810
01:00:56,201 --> 01:00:57,602
watching her die.

811
01:00:59,285 --> 01:01:01,167
She die.

812
01:01:02,767 --> 01:01:04,089
Every time.

813
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:10,777
The work was cursed with blood ...

814
01:01:10,817 --> 01:01:13,738
and through the
blood lives again and again.

815
01:01:13,819 --> 01:01:18,344
Nicholas, tell him to give me the book.

816
01:01:18,384 --> 01:01:20,466
Destroy them, I promise.

817
01:01:22,508 --> 01:01:23,549
It is not so easy.

818
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:26,192
You must break the cycle.

819
01:01:26,272 --> 01:01:29,236
Finally can you be a hero?

820
01:01:44,011 --> 01:01:45,652
Run, Wendy!

821
01:01:47,533 --> 01:01:50,136
The book. Everything is in the damn book.

822
01:02:09,356 --> 01:02:11,159
Osteroff was right.

823
01:02:11,999 --> 01:02:16,082
The animals do not fill
their thirst in the same way.

824
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,610
John, out here!

825
01:02:23,931 --> 01:02:25,373
We must get out of here.

826
01:02:36,424 --> 01:02:38,265
I will not let you kill them.

827
01:02:38,345 --> 01:02:41,188
I will not kill you.

828
01:02:41,228 --> 01:02:43,150
You not listen, right?

829
01:02:43,991 --> 01:02:45,592
I'm not the villain.

830
01:02:47,075 --> 01:02:49,036
Look. I'll show you.

831
01:03:00,048 --> 01:03:02,970
No. Can not be. It is not true.

832
01:03:04,052 --> 01:03:07,176
I fear all will die at the hands of him.

833
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,738
And all this happen tonight.

834
01:03:09,777 --> 01:03:11,418
No. Not so.

835
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:15,263
You were so close to free.

836
01:03:15,344 --> 01:03:16,624
So promising.

837
01:03:18,267 --> 01:03:19,988
Buchaccio, bring.

838
01:03:36,685 --> 01:03:37,887
You do not have to do this.

839
01:03:41,731 --> 01:03:42,730
Do not!

840
01:03:42,771 --> 01:03:44,093
Nicholas!

841
01:03:45,295 --> 01:03:47,377
Nicholas!

842
01:03:50,058 --> 01:03:51,219
Seal it.

843
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:54,624
Open the door, Brad!

844
01:03:55,825 --> 01:03:57,947
Open the damn door!

845
01:04:01,631 --> 01:04:04,515
You're not Brad, right? You Buchaccio.

846
01:04:06,316 --> 01:04:10,119
Buchaccio, I say to you,
open the door now.

847
01:04:10,158 --> 01:04:12,322
It is the book.

848
01:04:12,361 --> 01:04:15,845
It's the damn book!

849
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,967
I will destroy you!

850
01:05:01,172 --> 01:05:03,334
No, no.

851
01:05:07,938 --> 01:05:10,421
No need nights like this.

852
01:05:11,663 --> 01:05:13,344
Do you work in the game tomorrow?

853
01:05:15,665 --> 01:05:18,190
Too bad. Vera will.

854
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:23,195
She was anxious to see you
there, but you will not be there.

855
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:28,199
I bet that one
lucky will take home.

856
01:05:29,841 --> 01:05:33,964
Maybe I could be the lucky one.

857
01:05:35,367 --> 01:05:39,251
I know you like cops.

858
01:05:40,732 --> 01:05:42,534
You do not care, right?

859
01:05:45,897 --> 01:05:47,499
I'll be glad when the
Work is done ...

860
01:05:47,538 --> 01:05:50,222
and not have to come here.

861
01:06:13,807 --> 01:06:16,049
Rebecca! Open the window!

862
01:06:20,132 --> 01:06:21,734
Open the damn window!

863
01:06:23,775 --> 01:06:26,258
Rebecca, listen. I will not hurt you.

864
01:06:26,298 --> 01:06:28,460
All of them out here.
You must trust me.

865
01:06:28,501 --> 01:06:32,345
Rebecca, I can not hold
this forever.

866
01:06:32,424 --> 01:06:33,585
Rebecca!

867
01:06:35,188 --> 01:06:37,397
Why should I trust you, John?

868
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:42,676
Because they are all here
crazy, and I know insanity.

869
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:51,724
We will not leave until we burn the book.

870
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:58,853
Make yourself useful. Open the gate.

871
01:07:03,736 --> 01:07:05,298
They can not do that.

872
01:07:05,578 --> 01:07:06,739
Can they do that?

873
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:19,513
Salta. Come on!

874
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:23,036
My ankle.

875
01:07:23,116 --> 01:07:25,278
Come on, no time.
We can not stop.

876
01:07:30,243 --> 01:07:31,484
Are you going somewhere?

877
01:07:32,846 --> 01:07:34,488
Go to hell.

878
01:07:34,568 --> 01:07:36,291
I'm already there.

879
01:07:36,371 --> 01:07:37,771
We must hurry, John ...

880
01:07:37,812 --> 01:07:41,374
before the book
put you under the spell.

881
01:07:41,456 --> 01:07:44,137
Peter does not kill Nicholas in the Work.

882
01:07:45,299 --> 01:07:46,620
It's time to end this.

883
01:07:46,861 --> 01:07:48,302
Nicholas!

884
01:07:49,423 --> 01:07:51,826
Wanda, come.

885
01:07:51,866 --> 01:07:53,067
Join us.

886
01:08:01,515 --> 01:08:03,837
Definitely should not do this.

887
01:08:06,481 --> 01:08:08,163
Come on. You've come this far.

888
01:08:08,243 --> 01:08:09,445
My story ends.

889
01:08:10,445 --> 01:08:12,087
It's the only way you can win.

890
01:08:12,967 --> 01:08:14,729
- Father.
- Do not pray more.

891
01:08:14,769 --> 01:08:15,971
Do not kill him.

892
01:08:16,051 --> 01:08:17,612
You you looked like this.

893
01:08:18,572 --> 01:08:20,535
God help me, this is
your last chance.

894
01:08:20,575 --> 01:08:22,458
She's not your daughter.
Fight it, John.

895
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:25,419
Go back to your room,
daughter, and wait for me there.

896
01:08:25,459 --> 01:08:28,263
- You can not kill him.
- Yes.

897
01:08:28,302 --> 01:08:30,545
If I can.

898
01:08:30,585 --> 01:08:31,666
John!

899
01:08:32,467 --> 01:08:33,429
John!

900
01:08:33,508 --> 01:08:35,030
Back Natasha.

901
01:08:35,071 --> 01:08:37,993
- John, I'm Rebecca.
- John is not there.

902
01:08:38,954 --> 01:08:41,276
No, that's why I chose them.

903
01:08:42,236 --> 01:08:43,759
You have a daughter.

904
01:08:44,761 --> 01:08:48,925
The life you had
It was completed but never love.

905
01:08:51,288 --> 01:08:54,450
So I thought the book ever
He would have the power to control them.

906
01:08:54,491 --> 01:08:56,972
But clearly I was wrong.

907
01:08:57,011 --> 01:08:58,173
John.

908
01:08:59,054 --> 01:09:01,818
I'm Rebecca. You promised not to hurt me.

909
01:09:05,582 --> 01:09:09,545
For the sake of Sarah, do not hurt me.

910
01:09:09,586 --> 01:09:11,026
By Sarah.

911
01:09:20,717 --> 01:09:22,038
Sarah.

912
01:09:37,653 --> 01:09:39,295
Now I can end your pain.

913
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:42,619
It is too strong.

914
01:09:43,419 --> 01:09:45,222
I know you do not want to do this.

915
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:48,906
You know what I want.

916
01:09:48,947 --> 01:09:52,229
John, do not let him win.

917
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:53,870
I do not have to.

918
01:09:55,031 --> 01:09:56,553
Got your lighter?

919
01:09:57,714 --> 01:09:59,837
I lied when I said
they had left.

920
01:09:59,917 --> 01:10:02,721
Well, we all have our demons.

921
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,401
I regret that mine
ruin our family.

922
01:10:05,482 --> 01:10:08,245
I'll get the book and you burn.

923
01:10:14,011 --> 01:10:15,131
Quiet, boy.

924
01:10:15,172 --> 01:10:17,054
Maybe that's part of the Work.

925
01:10:17,135 --> 01:10:18,976
They are actors, right?

926
01:10:19,057 --> 01:10:20,017
Do not!

927
01:10:25,583 --> 01:10:27,626
Well, bring the tongs.
They're in the trunk.

928
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:34,191
Heaven.

929
01:10:36,234 --> 01:10:38,115
OK sweetie. It's okay.

930
01:10:38,156 --> 01:10:39,717
Everything will be fine.

931
01:10:40,758 --> 01:10:41,759
I do not think so.

932
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:46,125
It's okay.

933
01:10:46,365 --> 01:10:47,525
Yes.

934
01:10:47,606 --> 01:10:48,566
If it is okay.

935
01:10:48,645 --> 01:10:51,449
You kept your promise.

936
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:53,331
Hold on, Rebecca.

937
01:10:53,371 --> 01:10:55,173
That's.

938
01:10:55,253 --> 01:10:56,695
It is enough, John.

939
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:07,866
- Nicholas.
- You did the best you could.

940
01:11:07,946 --> 01:11:09,027
?Wendy?

941
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,311
Wendy ...

942
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:15,433
I know you want this
it is true, but it is not.

943
01:11:16,393 --> 01:11:17,677
None of this is real.

944
01:11:17,717 --> 01:11:19,758
He does not love you.

945
01:11:19,998 --> 01:11:21,000
He loves another.

946
01:11:21,079 --> 01:11:22,881
Yes he loves me.

947
01:11:24,083 --> 01:11:25,964
Nicholas, awaits.

948
01:11:26,005 --> 01:11:27,327
Listen me.

949
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:29,329
Give me a minute.

950
01:11:29,569 --> 01:11:33,171
If you really and truly
You want this to end ...

951
01:11:33,411 --> 01:11:34,492
fighting it.

952
01:11:34,572 --> 01:11:35,574
Fight.

953
01:11:35,654 --> 01:11:39,459
If you really loved her, fight now.

954
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,622
Look. Look at Wendy.

955
01:11:42,663 --> 01:11:43,744
Look at her.

956
01:11:44,024 --> 01:11:46,425
Do you want to die as Wanda?

957
01:11:48,308 --> 01:11:50,110
Nicholas!

958
01:11:50,149 --> 01:11:52,831
I told you. I told you.

959
01:11:54,154 --> 01:11:56,115
I'm not the villain.

960
01:11:56,155 --> 01:11:57,717
Nicholas!

961
01:11:58,999 --> 01:12:00,318
The book.

962
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:01,881
He'll kill you, John.

963
01:12:01,961 --> 01:12:05,565
A new cycle begins with
whoever possesses it.

964
01:12:06,566 --> 01:12:08,408
So bad.

965
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:11,009
Burn until
become ashes.

966
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:12,773
Burn it as dust.

967
01:12:26,228 --> 01:12:27,508
Wendy, come here.

968
01:12:27,549 --> 01:12:29,147
We must burn the book.

969
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:32,031
Get out of me!

970
01:12:32,071 --> 01:12:33,593
Wendy!

971
01:12:33,634 --> 01:12:35,195
Rebecca, will bring.

972
01:12:35,275 --> 01:12:36,797
Wendy!

973
01:12:44,606 --> 01:12:45,806
Wendy!

974
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:47,969
Wendy back!

975
01:12:49,529 --> 01:12:51,572
Wendy!

976
01:12:52,693 --> 01:12:54,695
Keep it away from me!

977
01:12:54,776 --> 01:12:57,258
- Keep it away from me!
- Wendy, give me the book.

978
01:12:57,337 --> 01:12:58,620
Stop right there!

979
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:03,224
- Wendy, we must burn the book.
- He killed them all.

980
01:13:03,264 --> 01:13:05,067
Give me the damn book!

981
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:15,837
Chris, what the hell?

982
01:13:35,497 --> 01:13:36,778
Are you okay?

983
01:13:36,858 --> 01:13:39,261
He killed them.

984
01:13:39,340 --> 01:13:40,862
He killed them all.

985
01:13:42,224 --> 01:13:45,187
I brought out with others ...

986
01:13:45,267 --> 01:13:47,348
and he began to stab me.

987
01:13:47,388 --> 01:13:50,312
And all the while shouting ...

988
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:53,956
"I'm the hero. I'm the hero."

989
01:13:54,035 --> 01:13:55,198
It's okay.

990
01:13:56,839 --> 01:13:59,121
I think we have enough.

991
01:13:59,362 --> 01:14:00,803
You need sleep.

992
01:14:09,892 --> 01:14:11,613
You will be fine.

993
01:14:14,777 --> 01:14:16,148
I know.
