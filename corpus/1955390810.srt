1
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,552
"The Girl has nerve.
She lives in a hotel room."

2
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,552
"She has no brothers, no sisters,
no mother, no father."

3
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,754
"She sings in a night-club."

4
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,837
(Sound of applause)

5
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,720
(piano playing)

6
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,758
"The first time I ask her,
she takes me home."

7
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,551
"She doesn't ask my name."

8
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,959
"I call her Agnus Dei."

9
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,354
"Agnus Dei,
Qui tollis pecata mundi."

10
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,755
"Agnus Dei, who takes away
the sins of the world."

11
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,952
I don't usually do it with women.

12
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,951
But there's something about you.

13
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,752
It's like being with a
beautiful young man

14
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,317
But it's just one night.

15
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,557
After this - basta.

16
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,157
"I stay in the streets at night."

17
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,150
"I end up at the banks of the Seine.
Where I stay part of the night waiting."

18
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,913
"I'm in the night club."

19
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,950
"I don't talk to her.
Sometimes she gives me a glance."

20
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,754
"Sometimes she laughs at
me between two songs."

21
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,360
"I don't ask her to take me home."

22
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,557
"She never tells me anything
about the men she meets at night."

23
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,474
"She's tough with them."

24
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,471
"lovely Agnus Dei."

25
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,756
She hangs around too much.

26
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,753
You're getting
all kinds of attention.

27
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,754
What's so extraordinary
about her, after all?

28
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,754
She's got that look in her eye.

29
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,837
She doesn't have a chance.

30
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,357
You going to kick her to the curb
like everyone else?

31
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,753
Bien sur.

32
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,754
(Applause)

33
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,351
You don't know...

34
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,877
what love is...

35
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,159
until you've learned
the meaning...

36
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,956
of the blues

37
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,950
Until you've loved a love
you had to lose.

38
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,957
You don't know...

39
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,957
what love is

40
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,797
You don't know...

41
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,919
how lips hurt...

42
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,560
until you've kissed and
held to pay the cost..

43
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,958
until you've flipped your heart
and you have lost.

44
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,953
No, you don't know...

45
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,351
what love is.

46
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,760
Do you know how a lost heart fears...

47
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,959
the thought of reminiscing...

48
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,959
And how lips that taste of tears...

49
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,759
lose their taste for kissing?

50
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,953
You don't know...

51
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,637
how hearts burn...

52
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,160
for love that cannot live yet never dies...

53
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,953
until you've faced each dawn
with sleepless eyes...

54
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,559
no, you don't know...

55
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,557
Make me with your clothes on.

56
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,557
what love is.

57
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,560
Just what I need, an artist.

58
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,754
I won't have a minute to breathe.

59
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,359
It'll be all the time, in bed...

60
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,357
when I get dressed,
when I put on my makeup.

61
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,557
You must take yourself for a Van Gogh...

62
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,959
maybe Picasso.

63
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,556
And you want me to model for free.

64
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,757
As though I owe it to genius.

65
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,957
Okay. It's time for you to go now.

66
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,957
I thought you wanted me to stay.

67
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,957
Enough of your drawing...

68
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,559
and of you.

69
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,957
Go fuck yourself.

70
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,957
You don't know me yet.

71
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,959
"Why is Agnus Dei so secure and confident?"

72
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,557
"She says she'll never need a gun or a knife,"

73
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,960
"Her tongue is enough
and the look in her eyes."

74
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,960
"Start with a concrete figure,
and arrive at an abstraction...

75
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,957
"with no corrections possible."

76
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,557
"The girl gives me a name."

77
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,957
"She calls me lover."

78
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,959
Remember the lovely sweet time
we had together?

79
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,960
Remember the violet tiaras
and the braided roses...

80
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,957
and the saffron you used to wear?

81
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,957
Remember the meadows of daffodils...

82
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,956
and how lightly you tread on them?

83
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,956
How you talk.

84
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,357
Tell me those words that no one
has ever told me.

85
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,157
Gentle, gentle lover.

86
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,957
Hands off.

87
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,957
"She uses her nakedness as an armour."

88
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,959
"The night is hers. The city is hers."

89
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,757
And to think I want men so much.

90
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,760
But you're like one of those heroes
from some old romance.

91
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,757
What do you know about real life?

92
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,356
"She never asks about my life."

93
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,954
"She doesn't know anything about me."

94
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,760
"When I'm not with her
I stop existing altogether for her."

95
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,957
"If need be she would say I'm a painter."

96
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,357
"Who cares and why not are her
favourite expressions."

97
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,352
"She's right. Who cares."

98
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,757
I can't help it, my love.

99
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,919
Violent delights have violent ends.

100
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,680
This isn't the first time for us
and it won't be the last.

101
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,353
I saw you from the window.

102
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,960
Would you believe that this time
I'm looking for you?

103
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,356
(Laughter)

104
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,956
You better hurry.

105
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,557
You're not fast enough.

106
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,357
The bath is ready. Lock the door.

107
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,916
Some people get dressed to socialize,
others get undressed

108
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,237
Let me guess which you prefer.

109
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,357
Take off your clothes.

110
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,756
Each time we see each other you act
as though if it's the last time.

111
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,359
Strange since I'm the one
who wants it to be last time.

112
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,957
You walk in. Plan to stay.

113
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,757
I'm all yours. Walk away.

114
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,957
I'm Spinning round and round
in games and mysteries.

115
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,158
I'm an artist, you know.

116
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,957
I've played parts in movies and TV shows.

117
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,350
That's the first step to a big role in an
important movie by a famous director.

118
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,192
I have relationships with a lot of people
who are going to help me out with my career.

119
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,557
That's the way it's done.

120
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,390
Friends give you a hand with your work.

121
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,950
Friends?

122
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,950
Yes.

123
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,950
You go to bed with them like you go
out to bars with them.

124
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,957
So that's the way it's done?

125
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,959
That's the way.

126
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,359
She isn't my type.

127
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,560
Who said, "I've wasted years of my life for a
woman who wasn't even my type?"

128
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,754
We do what we do.

129
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,759
Don't we?

130
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,755
It must be fascinating to be attracted to
someone who doesn't attract you.

131
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,680
"The idea that I could be a failure as a
painter doesn't occur to Bu Save."

132
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,757
"There's nothing judgmental about her."

133
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,960
"She understands the slow process of work
and its disappointing phases."

134
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,676
"Her presence and her absence
are everything to me."

135
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,955
I love dancing... with men and women.

136
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,156
I like dancing all alone just as much.

137
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,551
What do you think, painter?

138
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,957
Why don't you leave me alone?

139
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,957
I have to fight with men everyday.

140
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,557
I'm not going to do that with you.

141
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,757
I don't want you to come home with me.

142
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,757
Didn't you hear? I don't want to see anybody.

143
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,755
And don't wait for me either.
Make yourself scarce. Understand?

144
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,357
"Her room has the silver light of the
afternoon..."

145
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,557
"that comes with the paleness of the sky."

146
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,760
"The leaves of the plain trees are seen
inside out in a translucent green."

147
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,557
"The curtains bring up the memory of snow."

148
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,951
"Soon she and I are pulled out of the room..."

149
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,679
"and into an unadorned, open deserted space."

150
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,551
"Bu Save is never home anymore."

151
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,557
"There is no way to know when
she was here last."

152
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,753
(the girl sings) You can bet your
bottom dollar

153
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,756
that some no good man
has done her wrong.

154
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,957
Same thing when you hear a woman shout.

155
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,959
You can bet it's some old man
she's shouting about.

156
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,550
I say ain't it a mean old man's,
mean old man's world?

157
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,357
I say ain't it a mean old man's,
mean old man's world?

158
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:37,557
Oh it's a mean old man's,
mean old man's world.

159
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,752
It's a mean old man's.
mean old man's world.

160
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,359
I'm going to ask you one more time
girls the same thing.

161
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,956
You see man's held the world

162
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,912
in the palm of his hand

163
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,757
It's been that way ever since

164
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,956
the world began

165
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,960
I'm so thankful for the day

166
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,878
when mine started fooling around

167
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,951
where the big boys play cause

168
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,956
he wants to be the boss

169
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,151
that you understand cause he says

170
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,755
woman was made for nothin' but man

171
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,354
I ask you ain't it

172
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,356
I ask you ain't it

173
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,754
I ask you ain't it

174
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,356
one more time ain't it

175
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,356
ain't it a mean old man's

176
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,560
ain't it a mean old man's...

177
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,636
world?

178
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,959
He's putting the pressure on.
I can't trust him.

179
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,950
Is there anyone who can?

180
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,360
Where's the painter? I haven't seen
her in a long time.

181
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,357
I know I have a bad character.

182
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,552
I know that I'm not good and
that I'm illogical.

183
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,957
But you seem to understand me.

184
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,920
You never get mad at me.

185
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,357
"The day after there's no hurry."

186
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,957
"The hum of traffic sounds far away."

187
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,957
"There's a bright light behind
the white curtains."

188
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,551
"The sheets are soaked vivid with her perfume."

189
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,360
"I learn that if I look enough,
if I fumble long enough..."

190
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,360
"a form will slowly develop."

191
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,957
I could make a few sketches if you let me.

192
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,916
But I won't.

193
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,954
I want to draw you.

194
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,956
Well, Maybe I'll let you...

195
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,357
but under one condition.

196
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,354
And what would that be?

197
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,754
I have an idea.

198
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,557
Whatever it is, no.

199
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,957
You can look now.

200
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,357
You're rather pretty as a girl.

201
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,953
Is this what you really like?

202
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,552
I told you I'm not turned on by girls
who look like boys.

203
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,557
One day I'll ban you from my bed.

204
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:57,956
Will you?

205
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,552
Yes, because this is how I want you.

206
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,277
I wanted to see how it feels.

207
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,754
I've met you already. Your face is familiar.

208
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,553
Maybe I remind you of someone.

209
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,560
That's it. You remind me very much of someone.

210
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,750
I hope it's a good memory.

211
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,276
It is.

212
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,357
(the girl) Do you see him?

213
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,551
(the girl) He's the one that's watching us.

214
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,957
He's watching you.

215
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,957
He can't watch me without seeing you too.

216
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,359
Why did you bring me here?

217
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,757
Because I want you to know about him.

218
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,915
He's a dangerous man and a clever man.

219
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,354
It's time you found out.

220
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,153
It would be unfair to go on like this.

221
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,352
If he pushes me so much it might be
because you're watching him.

222
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,956
You're not up to him.
You must know that.

223
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,754
It's already gone too far.

224
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,956
Who cares?

225
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,957
I may care a little.

226
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,751
That's new. It doesn't sound like anything
you've written before.

227
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,550
Does that mean you like it?

228
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,957
Very much.

229
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,559
I'm not working well.

230
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,953
You should say not working at all.

231
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,753
Just keep working.

232
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,956
I will.

233
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,637
All these flowers give me the chills.

234
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,959
It looks like a funeral home.

235
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,796
There are more than enough for
a still life... very still.

236
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,753
I don't do still life.

237
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,560
If at least they were flowers that I like.

238
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,358
Red poppies and blue cornflowers.

239
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,956
But no chance.

240
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,916
What's wrong?

241
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,556
Nothing.

242
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,919
Help me with this, will you?!

243
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,957
You look pale.

244
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:35,957
(knock knock)

245
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,354
(Bartender) five minutes to show time.

246
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,358
Wait for me after the show.

247
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:46,953
(Door knock)

248
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,356
Take them back.

249
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,359
Leave me alone!

250
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,357
(bartender) Bar's closed. It's getting late.

251
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,756
It won't happen again.

252
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,159
Forget it. Let's get out of here.

253
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,960
A man will never say to his girlfriend
that he enjoys fucking men.

254
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,917
That's the worst thing he could admit.

255
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:37,958
But...

256
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,159
when they're with me...

257
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,637
they pretend to be doing it with a man.

258
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,357
They call me men's names.

259
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,037
I know what nobody else knows.

260
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,359
That's what I have over them.

261
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,753
That's why they come back.

262
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,956
I know they do.

263
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,357
"I skip a lot of classes now."

264
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,390
"I haven't touched a brush or a pencil
on my own in a long time."

265
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,832
"but I still come to the morning class."

266
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,559
"The night is slow to come."

267
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,754
"I don't go to the nightclub
very often anymore."

268
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,553
"She tells me to stay away."

269
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,360
"But sometimes I stand outside
to watch over her."

270
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,353
My last song went all wrong.

271
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,953
And the pianist slowed down.

272
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,356
There were important people there tonight.

273
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,359
You were the most important.

274
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:18,120
Because all you see is me.
You only see women.

275
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,954
And you only see men.

276
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,276
Fucking is damned good.
What do you say lover?

277
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,757
But it won't last. I warn you.

278
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,956
No, sir. No, Lover...

279
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,153
not if you persist in your attitude.

280
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,910
You, prissy, pricky little cock.

281
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:01,190
If I am not good enough for you, if I am
not clever enough, then forget it.

282
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,552
What's good enough for them is good
enough for you.

283
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,353
I'll show you, Lover, what I do every night...

284
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,359
and you'll like it.

285
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,151
But first come.

286
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,351
Look at me, come.

287
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,276
What is it?

288
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,556
What?

289
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,914
It says, "Get rid of her now
or someone else will."

290
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,198
You know what I do when someone
tries to force me to do something?

291
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:29,755
You don't do it.

292
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,557
I don't do it.

293
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,357
So, I'm keeping you...

294
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,957
at any cost.

295
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,359
Now they'll see what I'm made of.

296
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,280
I'm in trouble.

297
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,353
I'm here to keep you out of trouble.

298
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,359
Can you do that?

299
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,357
You know I can.

300
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,557
For how long?

301
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,357
For only as long as you want me to.

302
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,951
A kir.

303
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,116
(Door Knock)

304
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,356
(Door Knock)

305
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,040
What do you think you're doing?!
Get the hell out of here!

306
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,753
I can fuck whoever I want to!

307
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,677
Now do you understand?

308
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,432
I don't want you to be mixed
up in all this.

309
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:30,750
I don't want you to know more.

310
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:34,756
Now I'm scared.

311
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,551
"Is it the morning after?"

312
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,679
"Are the leaves behind the window
a very tender green?"

313
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,197
"Does she tell me that she can't
go on without me?"

314
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,277
"Do I hold her so tight that no one..."

315
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,234
"not even that man, can ever tear
her from my arms?"

316
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,559
"I look for Bu Save in the places
she and I spend time."

317
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,352
(Loud knock)

318
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,354
Who's that?

319
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,957
I'd like to know.

320
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,357
They took my gun.

321
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,432
He thinks he owns everyone. And he
wants to make sure you know that.

322
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,357
Does he own everyone?

323
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,156
He doesn't own me.

324
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,756
I'm here to keep you out of trouble,
remember?

325
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,959
Sing a song for me.

326
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,356
I can't.

327
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,959
Here's something for you, lover...

328
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:17,831
But you won't like it.

329
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:18,951
It's very nasty.

330
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,551
"This time you'll pay."

331
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,280
Well, here we are.

332
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,677
I'm the one who's going to get it.

333
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,757
I'm the one who will pay.

334
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,351
"Night after night, bar after bar..."

335
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:21,430
"I keep following him."

336
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,236
Bu Save?

337
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:50,951
Bu Save?

338
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,550
Is it loaded?

339
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,519
Here. Be careful.

340
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,959
Is she in?

341
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,153
She left a few hours ago.

342
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,356
Was she alone?

343
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,557
I said, was she alone?

344
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,359
We respect our guest's privacy.
As you are aware.

345
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,750
I need to know.

346
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,959
I really didn't pay attention.

347
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,954
Have you seen her?

348
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,359
No. A drink

349
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:58,956
Thanks.

350
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,039
I think she left town with the boss.

351
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,358
The boss?

352
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:07,319
You didn't know? He owns the place
and everyone in it.

353
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,359
What if she's gone for good?

354
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:43,958
Lover.

355
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,829
Come in. Look what I have for us.

356
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,150
You'll like this.

357
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:07,556
Here.

358
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,559
You may need this.

359
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:18,559
Thank you, lover.

360
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,953
You don't know what I went through.

361
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,676
Forget it. You don't need to know.

362
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:38,956
(Applause)

363
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,837
You walk in. Plan to stay.

364
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,757
I'm all yours, Walk away.

365
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,960
I'm spinning round and round in
games and mysteries.

366
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,356
Taking me in, right from the start.

367
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:29,158
Give you my world, tear it apart.

368
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,757
Love may be blind but I'm

369
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,678
Not one for wasting my time.

370
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,957
Not one for wasting my time.

371
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,757
Not one for wasting my time.

372
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:08,356
What can I do?

373
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,359
Stay with me.

374
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:11,350
Lover, why don't get us something to drink,
and come back later?

375
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:16,438
And watch for me at the window.
Will you do that, lover?

376
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,957
Then it will be just the two of us.

377
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,356
"I go to the girl's place as usual."

378
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,677
"I don't ask any questions."

379
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,039
She doesn't mention the night before.

380
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,959
Have some foie-gras, Lover.
Or would you prefer caviar?

381
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,870
Anyway, you must taste this wine. It's superb.

382
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,359
What's the matter with you, Lover?

383
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,960
I'm going to take you on a cruise. On a
boat going very far away.

384
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,357
I don't know where, maybe...
maybe the Bahamas.

385
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,670
I can't stay.

386
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:09,358
Lover...

387
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,157
why don't you take me into your arms?

388
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,954
Talk to me.

389
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,555
I have to go.

390
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:12,956
"I walk"

391
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,156
"I walk."

392
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:16,956
"Hours pass..."

393
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:18,956
"maybe days."

394
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:24,159
"There are no birds. There's no sun."

395
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:28,159
"There's no lights. There are no clouds."

396
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,954
(Gun shot)

397
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:54,356
Agnus Dei?

398
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,354
Agnus Dei?

399
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,957
Did he hurt you, Lover?
