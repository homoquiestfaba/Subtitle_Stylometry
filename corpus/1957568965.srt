We'll store it.

197

Put it in a storage somewhere.

Philosophy can seem hard.

But remember

315
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:35,688
what we talked about.

00:21:37,392 --> 00:21:38,457

and experiences.

320
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:45,024
resimplify them.

321
00:21:46,231 --> 00:21:49,011
Confucius once said

322
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:54,962
that, "Success depends on previous preparation

323
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:57,998
and without that preparation,

324
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,814
there is bound to be failure."

And the truth is,

329
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:13,137
we can fix it

330
00:22:13,964 --> 00:22:16,469
by studying.

331
00:22:20,287 --> 00:22:21,087

Yes, Mr. Murphy.

344
00:22:54,822 --> 00:22:55,622
Okay...

345
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:58,771
Let's start with Eastern Philosophy.

346
00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:02,276
So,

347
00:23:02,837 --> 00:23:04,297
we have up here

348
00:23:05,437 --> 00:23:07,922

349
00:23:08,277 --> 00:23:10,402
famous philosophers.

350
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:12,161
And what we're gonna do

351
00:23:12,575 --> 00:23:14,190
is we're gonna have to figure out

352
00:23:14,577 --> 00:23:16,095
where they are from

353
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:18,797
or what philosophy they represent.

354
00:23:19,242 --> 00:23:20,497
Blue will be west,

355
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,517
red will be east.

356
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:24,557
So,

357
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:27,239
starting off with Socrates.

358
00:23:29,546 --> 00:23:31,091
Where was Socrates from?

359
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:32,499

Greece.

361
00:23:33,603 --> 00:23:35,188
So, what will that make him?

362
00:23:35,422 --> 00:23:36,222
Greek.

363
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,810

There you go.

Where is Greece?

366
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,920
In Europe.

367
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:44,439
And is that East or West?

368
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:47,768
Mm-hmm.

369
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:48,828

[twinkling background music]

634
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,767
Welcome, young traveler.

635
00:39:25,255 --> 00:39:27,309
If you are embarking on this journey

636
00:39:27,351 --> 00:39:29,126
for the first time,

637
00:39:29,394 --> 00:39:33,499
know that this box is no ordinary box.

638
00:39:33,553 --> 00:39:36,196
It comes with a potential to give you

639
00:39:36,238 --> 00:39:38,323
a vision of the future

640
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:42,609
and has the power to transport you to that future

641
00:39:42,651 --> 00:39:45,441
if you touch the box for too long.

642
00:39:46,026 --> 00:39:47,146
But, be warned...

643
00:39:47,772 --> 00:39:51,347
This power and ability also carries with it

644
00:39:51,907 --> 00:39:53,737
a grave warning.

645
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:57,270
The power to transport you to that future in time

646
00:39:57,477 --> 00:40:00,744
also means you will be unable to return

647
00:40:00,786 --> 00:40:01,776
to the present.

648
00:40:02,216 --> 00:40:04,511
A power and a warning.

649
00:40:04,966 --> 00:40:06,936
Take heed, traveler.

650
00:40:06,983 --> 00:40:09,178
The choice is yours.

651
00:40:09,638 --> 00:40:13,163

I'm... you.

666
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,150
The future you.

667
00:42:09,254 --> 00:42:12,159
I know it must be so much to take in.

668
00:42:12,827 --> 00:42:14,512
Seeing yourself,

669
00:42:14,714 --> 00:42:16,435
talking to yourself.

670
00:42:16,477 --> 00:42:17,277
[stutters]

671
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:20,883
Well,

672
00:42:21,168 --> 00:42:23,198
there's a reason for cutting through time.

673
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:24,655
Space...

674
00:42:25,047 --> 00:42:25,847
...whatever it is.

675
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:27,589
A reason?

676
00:42:28,365 --> 00:42:29,165
Yes!

677
00:42:29,397 --> 00:42:30,197
A reason.

678
00:42:31,524 --> 00:42:33,164
I was told by a lying sage that

679
00:42:33,475 --> 00:42:35,434
if I ever had to return to my past

680
00:42:35,476 --> 00:42:37,151
and meet my younger self,

681
00:42:37,874 --> 00:42:40,169
that it would only bring myself some trouble.

682
00:42:42,163 --> 00:42:42,963
And...

683
00:42:45,498 --> 00:42:46,298
I remembered...

684
00:42:47,892 --> 00:42:49,700
I've remembered going through some

685
00:42:49,742 --> 00:42:51,802
very hard times.

686
00:42:52,675 --> 00:42:53,475
Life...

687
00:42:54,049 --> 00:42:56,344
Life seemed very difficult.

688
00:42:58,188 --> 00:43:00,641
And I also remembered not wanting things to seem

689
00:43:00,683 --> 00:43:01,583
the way they were.

690
00:43:04,008 --> 00:43:05,218
Wanting the way out.

691
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:09,166
You're thinking

692
00:43:09,229 --> 00:43:11,082
just forgetting about your life.

693
00:43:11,124 --> 00:43:12,119
Transporting here.

694
00:43:12,251 --> 00:43:13,051
Remember?

695
00:43:16,736 --> 00:43:17,656
But you...

696
00:43:17,976 --> 00:43:19,886
...are the one who can change your life.

697
00:43:19,941 --> 00:43:20,741
Not others.

698
00:43:22,793 --> 00:43:23,858
Future's up to you.

699
00:43:24,198 --> 00:43:24,998

Avery?

700
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,445
Avery, honey, where are you?

701
00:43:26,883 --> 00:43:27,683
Avery, where are you?

702
00:43:28,612 --> 00:43:29,712
I... I have to go

703
00:43:30,049 --> 00:43:31,249
Uh, someone's calling me.

704
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:32,129
I can't... I can't stay.

705
00:43:32,615 --> 00:43:34,650
I'm not even supposed to be here.

706
00:43:35,574 --> 00:43:37,227
Avery, you must listen to me.

707
00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:38,069
You can't come.

708
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,332
If you do,

709
00:43:39,517 --> 00:43:40,960
you'll change the current events,

710
00:43:41,002 --> 00:43:41,917
you'll alter the course.

711
00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:44,628
Everyone and everything you ever loved...

712
00:43:44,978 --> 00:43:46,413
will not exist.

713
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,335

[gloomy music]

787
00:50:32,525 --> 00:50:34,378
I got my grades back from my teacher.

[gloomy music]

789
00:50:37,237 --> 00:50:38,037
Yeah, you know?

790
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:39,086
It's been kind of...

791
00:50:40,189 --> 00:50:42,064
Do you think they have any dairy-free options?

792
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:48,003
Hmm, maybe I should try...

793
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:55,065
[intense music]

794
00:50:55,112 --> 00:50:55,912
What are you gonna get?

795
00:50:55,962 --> 00:51:05,670

00:51:09,555 --> 00:51:10,338

[intense music]

800
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:20,619

[intense music]

802
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,155
I don't know why, I just, um...

00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:35,358
[intense music]

804
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:52,163
[intense music]

805
00:51:52,205 --> 00:51:53,005
Hello, Avery.

00:51:53,070 --> 00:52:00,752
[intense music]

807
00:52:00,794 --> 00:52:01,592
Avery?

808
00:52:01,634 --> 00:52:06,857
[intense music]

809
00:52:06,899 --> 00:52:07,657
Ola, Avery?

810
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:08,694
[gasps]

811
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:10,301
Hey...

812
00:52:10,842 --> 00:52:11,642
[sighs]

813
00:52:12,068 --> 00:52:12,868
Hey... Hey, Robert

814
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:16,183
Not Robert,

815
00:52:16,741 --> 00:52:17,541
it's Roberto.

816
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:20,450
Roberto, Avery.

817
00:52:20,683 --> 00:52:21,733
Not Robert.

818
00:52:21,859 --> 00:52:22,659
Roberto.

819
00:52:23,177 --> 00:52:23,977
Alright, try.

820
00:52:24,255 --> 00:52:25,625
Repeat after me. Come on.

821
00:52:25,882 --> 00:52:27,277
Roberto.

822
00:52:28,882 --> 00:52:30,236
Roberto.

823
00:52:30,278 --> 00:52:31,283
Ro-ber-to.

824
00:52:31,668 --> 00:52:32,798
Roberto.

825
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:34,912
Close enough.

826
00:52:38,451 --> 00:52:39,531
So, how's Mom and Dad?

827
00:52:43,442 --> 00:52:44,242
Good.

828
00:52:44,513 --> 00:52:45,313
I guess...

829
00:52:47,471 --> 00:52:48,271
Look, Avery,

830
00:52:48,809 --> 00:52:50,914
I don't mind letting you hang out here.

831
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:52,936
I'm here for you.

832
00:52:55,461 --> 00:52:56,706
But, is everything okay?

833
00:53:01,927 --> 00:53:02,685
[scoffs]

834
00:53:02,727 --> 00:53:03,487
Yeah.

835
00:53:03,529 --> 00:53:04,549
Yeah, everything's fine.

836
00:53:06,509 --> 00:53:07,309
Really?

837
00:53:08,391 --> 00:53:10,711
Because I can tell a fake smile when I see one.

838
00:53:13,919 --> 00:53:14,719
Listen, Avery,

839
00:53:15,813 --> 00:53:17,953
I've had to make some hard choices before.

840
00:53:20,373 --> 00:53:21,173
I remember one time,

841
00:53:21,274 --> 00:53:23,794
this Australian guy came in to the restaurant, right?

842
00:53:24,022 --> 00:53:26,047
Big, buff, Australian guy.

843
00:53:26,827 --> 00:53:28,943
But he was really rude to his girlfriend

844
00:53:28,985 --> 00:53:29,785
and his friends.

845
00:53:30,568 --> 00:53:31,326
[crunch]

846
00:53:31,368 --> 00:53:32,288
So,

847
00:53:33,399 --> 00:53:35,009
right before I took his order,

848
00:53:35,862 --> 00:53:37,242
he stopped me and he said,

849
00:53:37,956 --> 00:53:38,801
[imitating Australian accent] Oy, mate.

850
00:53:39,362 --> 00:53:40,297
Lo quero Taco Bell.

851
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:41,259
[exclaims]

852
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:43,051
And the whole table was laughing.

853
00:53:44,445 --> 00:53:45,815
At first, I thought it was stupid.

854
00:53:46,001 --> 00:53:46,801
[crunch]

855
00:53:47,435 --> 00:53:49,070
I don't even like Taco Bell.

856
00:53:50,381 --> 00:53:51,756
But then I realized that

857
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:54,386
he was making fun of me.

858
00:53:55,881 --> 00:53:56,681
Then I got mad.

859
00:53:58,634 --> 00:53:59,434
So,

860
00:53:59,811 --> 00:54:00,611
what did you do?

861
00:54:01,625 --> 00:54:02,383
[exhales]

862
00:54:02,425 --> 00:54:03,225
So,

863
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:05,898
right before I gave him his food,

864
00:54:07,293 --> 00:54:09,923
I made sure we put the hottest hot sauce

865
00:54:10,225 --> 00:54:11,025
in his burrito.

866
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:12,210
No way.

867
00:54:12,674 --> 00:54:13,474
Yup.

868
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:14,655
True story.

869
00:54:15,598 --> 00:54:17,093
He got so red

870
00:54:18,492 --> 00:54:21,077
that his mouth was on fire.

871
00:54:21,139 --> 00:54:21,939
[laughs]

872
00:54:22,163 --> 00:54:23,803
He got up and left the restaurant.

873
00:54:23,981 --> 00:54:24,739
[laugh]

874
00:54:24,781 --> 00:54:27,355
Everybody in the counter was dying.

875
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:29,432
We were laughing so loud

876
00:54:30,325 --> 00:54:32,625
to a point that the boss came out.

877
00:54:35,093 --> 00:54:36,663
He pulled me aside and he told me

878
00:54:37,674 --> 00:54:39,649
that that guy that I just did that to?

879
00:54:40,917 --> 00:54:43,794
Apparently, he was the new contractor he hired

880
00:54:43,836 --> 00:54:45,371
to renovate the whole building.

881
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:46,690
No!

882
00:54:47,163 --> 00:54:47,963
Mm-hmm.

883
00:54:49,108 --> 00:54:49,908
So,

884
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:52,563
what happened after that?

885
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:54,839
Well,

886
00:54:55,608 --> 00:54:56,408
I got a warning,

887
00:54:58,570 --> 00:55:01,140
but I learned a very valuable lesson that day.

888
00:55:02,778 --> 00:55:03,578
A lesson?

889
00:55:05,489 --> 00:55:06,289
A lesson.

890
00:55:07,609 --> 00:55:08,764
I learned that,

891
00:55:10,215 --> 00:55:12,825
Australian people can't really handle spicy food.

892
00:55:14,415 --> 00:55:15,840
[laughs]

893
00:55:15,965 --> 00:55:17,090
But, no, seriously.

894
00:55:18,413 --> 00:55:19,803
I learned that

895
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:23,319
my decision to hurt someone else,

896
00:55:24,869 --> 00:55:26,324
only hurt me in the end.

897
00:55:28,695 --> 00:55:29,495
Remember, Avery.

898
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:32,610
You can't change people,

899
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:38,767
but you can change yourself.

900
00:55:40,122 --> 00:55:42,132
Only you can change

901
00:55:42,691 --> 00:55:43,491
who you are.

902
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:45,395
And your future.

903
00:55:46,986 --> 00:55:49,312
So, all these people that bully you in school,

904
00:55:49,354 --> 00:55:51,069
all the people that aren't nice to you,

905
00:55:52,233 --> 00:55:54,283
don't let them define who you are.

906
00:55:56,095 --> 00:55:58,290
Only you have the power to do that.

907
00:56:02,694 --> 00:56:03,452
[crunch]

908
00:56:03,494 --> 00:56:04,294
Anyway,

909
00:56:04,514 --> 00:56:06,109
that's enough wisdom for one day.

910
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,376
Same as usual?

911
00:56:08,418 --> 00:56:09,181
Uh, yeah.

912
00:56:09,223 --> 00:56:12,133
I'll have a torto sour cream and onions.

913
00:56:12,774 --> 00:56:14,409
"Torta", Avery.

914
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:15,450
It's "torta."

915
00:56:16,524 --> 00:56:17,324
"Torta."

916
00:56:18,136 --> 00:56:19,866
There you go, that wasn't so hard.

917
00:56:21,425 --> 00:56:22,183
Alright.

918
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:23,774
Let me go to the back and I'll put in your order.

919
00:56:23,816 --> 00:56:24,616
Okay.

920
00:56:24,721 --> 00:56:25,521
Bye, Robert.

921
00:56:30,871 --> 00:56:32,561
"Roberto."

922
00:56:34,025 --> 00:56:35,535
Uh-huh. That's what I thought.

923
00:56:35,605 --> 00:56:45,210
[background music]

924
00:56:45,252 --> 00:56:46,052
Excuse me.

925
00:56:49,026 --> 00:56:50,031
I didn't help but overhear.

926
00:56:50,268 --> 00:56:51,898
Were you talking about bullies?

927
00:56:53,097 --> 00:56:53,897
Uhm...

928
00:56:54,485 --> 00:56:55,285
Yeah?

929
00:56:58,171 --> 00:56:59,509
I know what you're going through.

930
00:56:59,551 --> 00:57:00,309
I've been there, too.

931
00:57:00,351 --> 00:57:07,486
[background music]

932
00:57:07,547 --> 00:57:08,812
Hi. I'm Cavenough.

933
00:57:11,436 --> 00:57:12,301
I'm Avery.

934
00:57:13,539 --> 00:57:15,594
Don't mind him at all, he's not shy.

935
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:20,111
I was bullied, too.

936
00:57:20,536 --> 00:57:21,336
In first grade,

937
00:57:21,744 --> 00:57:23,219
the kids were calling me weird because

938
00:57:23,336 --> 00:57:25,661
I was doing work faster than everyone.

939
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:28,217
And I didn't look like anyone in my class.

940
00:57:28,587 --> 00:57:30,163
I was scared to tell my mom.

941
00:57:30,205 --> 00:57:32,675
And shortly after, I had a hard time eating.

942
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:36,773
And I didn't enjoy doing all the fun stuff that

943
00:57:36,815 --> 00:57:37,615
I used to love to do.

944
00:57:38,814 --> 00:57:41,042
Because I had a darkness inside of me

945
00:57:41,084 --> 00:57:43,969
and at first, I thought the bullying was my fault.

946
00:57:44,134 --> 00:57:46,274
But, one day, I did a brave thing

947
00:57:46,336 --> 00:57:48,446
and I told my mom what was going on.

948
00:57:50,105 --> 00:57:52,465
And she asked me how she could help

949
00:57:52,517 --> 00:57:55,007
and she just helped me turn that darkness

950
00:57:55,752 --> 00:57:58,421
into a big spark to change the entire world.

951
00:57:58,463 --> 00:58:00,616
And now, I go across the country,

952
00:58:00,658 --> 00:58:03,103
making people smile, spreading positivity,

953
00:58:03,628 --> 00:58:05,588
and helping other kids who are being bullied.

954
00:58:05,738 --> 00:58:06,496
So,

955
00:58:06,538 --> 00:58:07,933
don't let those bullies get to you.

956
00:58:09,112 --> 00:58:10,272
Whatever you believe,

957
00:58:10,427 --> 00:58:11,227
you can achieve.

958
00:58:11,438 --> 00:58:13,250
Don't ever let anybody tell you differently.

959
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:14,092
And remember,

960
00:58:14,501 --> 00:58:17,106
you got this and you are powerful.

961
00:58:19,623 --> 00:58:20,668
Wow, uhm...

962
00:58:21,394 --> 00:58:22,152

01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:09,125
Life can only be understood backwards,

1151
01:10:10,068 --> 01:10:12,443
but it must be lived forwards.

1152
01:10:15,202 --> 01:10:17,407
William Ernest Henley once said that,

1153
01:10:17,898 --> 01:10:19,988
"I am the master of my fate."

1154
01:10:22,365 --> 01:10:24,295
"I am the captain of my soul."

1155
01:10:26,497 --> 01:10:27,412
Basically,

1156
01:10:28,293 --> 01:10:30,408
we determine our future.

1157
01:10:31,872 --> 01:10:32,987
It's up to us.

1158
01:10:36,988 --> 01:10:37,788
Us.

1159
01:10:42,663 --> 01:10:44,271
Very well said, Avery.

1160
01:10:44,313 --> 01:10:45,338
Very well said.

1161
01:10:49,503 --> 01:10:51,258
Wonderful, wonderful. Okay...

1162
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:54,485
So, that takes care of Soren Kierkegaard. And

1163
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:56,614
as Avery mentioned,

1164
01:10:56,931 --> 01:10:58,796
William E. Henley.

1165
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:00,495
Next, we have here...

1168
01:11:14,715 --> 01:11:16,220
Mia, Shailey.

1169
01:11:16,312 --> 01:11:17,642
We need to talk.

1170
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:18,990
Okay...

1171
01:11:19,194 --> 01:11:19,994
Okay?

1172
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:21,443
Girls...

1173
01:11:21,956 --> 01:11:23,356
Is it true that you've been...

1174
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:26,692
you've been bullying other kids?

1175
01:11:27,422 --> 01:11:30,952
You know how we feel about that kind of nonsense.

1176
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:33,510
We've talked about it a hundred times!

1177
01:11:33,804 --> 01:11:34,604
I just...

1178
01:11:34,838 --> 01:11:36,773
I just can't believe...

1179
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:37,720
Who was it?

1180
01:11:38,506 --> 01:11:40,169

It was Avery, okay, Mom?

1187
01:11:56,897 --> 01:11:58,427
I didn't mean to.

1188
01:11:59,627 --> 01:12:02,352
Mr. Murphy told me about your grades, Shailey

1189
01:12:02,803 --> 01:12:06,423
And that is another conversation we will have.

1190
01:12:06,963 --> 01:12:08,408
Do you understand?

1191
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:09,400
Yes.

1192
01:12:10,172 --> 01:12:11,267
And back to Avery,

1193
01:12:12,035 --> 01:12:13,535
do you know that Mr. Murphy

1194
01:12:13,841 --> 01:12:16,696
said that she was your only hope

1195
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:18,770
in passing that class?

1196
01:12:19,417 --> 01:12:20,217
No.

1197
01:12:22,617 --> 01:12:23,417
Girls,

1198
01:12:23,615 --> 01:12:24,415
it's wrong.

1199
01:12:25,022 --> 01:12:26,682
It is not who we are.

1200
01:12:27,223 --> 01:12:28,808
We don't do that.

1201
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,045
It doesn't matter who you are;

It doesn't matter.

1206
01:12:39,847 --> 01:12:41,077
Do you hear me?

1207
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:43,505
Did you hear me?

1208
01:12:43,672 --> 01:12:44,472
Yes, Ma'am.

1209
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:46,728
You girls

1210
01:12:46,834 --> 01:12:49,394
better start treating others with respect.

1211
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,420
Do you understand?

Yes, Mia?

1215
01:12:55,969 --> 01:12:57,814
I'm sorry. I knew it was wrong

1216
01:12:57,867 --> 01:12:59,803
I promise I won't do that anymore.

1217
01:12:59,845 --> 01:13:00,645
I promise.

- I'm sorry.

01:14:11,366 --> 01:14:13,591
how did you know that quote in class?

1234
01:14:14,076 --> 01:14:15,681
Yeah, that was so cool.

1235
01:14:16,704 --> 01:14:17,837
Mr. Murphy said

1236
01:14:17,879 --> 01:14:19,714
that I'm not doing too well in class.

1237
01:14:19,979 --> 01:14:21,316

then, you'd help me to, you know

So, what's your next one?

1295
01:18:03,442 --> 01:18:04,242

Doing that made me realize that

I should treat others the way I wanted to be treated.

1339
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:34,480
Hey, Amy!

1340
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:35,340
Sorry.

1341
01:20:35,745 --> 01:20:36,503
Uhm, listen...

1342
01:20:36,545 --> 01:20:38,525
We're on our way back home soon.

1343
01:20:38,706 --> 01:20:40,016
We got a flat tire.

1344
01:20:40,865 --> 01:20:42,680
No problem, Ms. Thompson.

1345
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:44,418
It's a bit cold, though.

1346
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:46,020
Should I get my mom to pick me up?

1347
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:47,239
Oh no, no.

1348
01:20:47,798 --> 01:20:48,658
Tell your mom it's fine.

1349
01:20:49,137 --> 01:20:50,205
Listen, the house key

1350
01:20:50,247 --> 01:20:52,467
is under the clay pot next to the front door.

1351
01:20:52,735 --> 01:20:54,647
Go inside and get out of the cold.

1352
01:20:54,689 --> 01:20:55,554
We'll be back soon.

1353
01:20:56,109 --> 01:20:57,476
Oh, there's food in the fridge,

1354
01:20:57,518 --> 01:20:58,832
have whatever you want.

1355
01:20:58,874 --> 01:21:00,054
Okay, Ms. Thompson.

1356
01:21:00,577 --> 01:21:02,037
Oh, Avery says hi.

1357
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:03,609
She can't wait to see you.

1358
01:21:03,947 --> 01:21:05,017
Okay, thanks.

1359
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:06,020
Mm-hmm. Buh-bye!

Where do I go?

01:24:20,553 --> 01:24:22,893
What is my future?

1388
01:24:23,298 --> 01:24:25,378
How to be known?

1389
01:24:25,743 --> 01:24:28,233
God will make a change.

1390
01:24:28,503 --> 01:24:30,348
Find a new way.

1391
01:24:32,288 --> 01:24:34,593
Pass down the prizes,

1392

When I touched the lives of others,

1396
01:24:45,913 --> 01:24:47,583
I'll affect my own.

1397
01:24:48,488 --> 01:24:50,358
I am not the same.

It's too late now to turn around and back again.

01:25:25,318 --> 01:25:29,483
I made my bed and now, I lay my head in it.

I'm sorry I'm not perfect, but I knew that I wouldn't be.

And I feel misunderstood,

'cause I’m trying hard to love.

1409
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:05,911
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. My actions, they haunt me.

1410
01:26:05,953 --> 01:26:08,983
And I'll never live it down.

You call my bluff.

1414
01:26:18,508 --> 01:26:19,856
I won't pick up,

1415
01:26:19,898 --> 01:26:21,358
I'll let it ring.

1416
01:26:24,488 --> 01:26:28,463
Record your voice so I can listen back again.

Holding down a second chance.

1431
01:27:25,578 --> 01:27:27,558
I'm too selfish for that.

01:27:27,733 --> 01:27:29,018
I'll let you fall again.

1433
01:27:29,158 --> 01:27:31,118
