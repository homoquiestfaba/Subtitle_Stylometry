Whoa! Whoa!

00:01:06,235 --> 00:01:08,533  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Whoa, whoa!

5
00:01:28,813 --> 00:01:30,610  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Silence in court!

6
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,128  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now we come, not for the first
time, to Jarndyce and Jarndyce.

7
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:37,765  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes, Mr Tangle?

8
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:41,556  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
As we know, m'lud, the problem
with which we grapple in the case
of Jarndyce and Jarndyce

9
00:01:41,596 --> 00:01:44,956  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
is that there are several wills
and fragments of wills,

10
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:48,034  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
all of them different,
all of them conflicting.

11
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:51,584  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is there much more
of this, Mr Tangle?

12
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:55,462  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
Afraid there is. . .
a variety of points.

13
00:01:55,508 --> 00:01:59,015  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
I feel it my duty to submit. . .
Ludship.

14
00:01:59,058 --> 00:02:04,214  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
Mr Brownlow, you appear
for Lady Dedlock in this matter.
Do you have any matters of urgency?

15
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:07,731  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Er. . . No, m'lud. Ah.

16
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:12,806  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
I see that Mr Tulkinghorn has graced
us with his presence this morning.

17
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:14,319  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523

20
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:23,874  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes, my love. Remarkable.

21
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:28,708  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
And I am bored to death with it.
Ah, well. . .

22
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:31,025  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bored to death with this place,

23
00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:32,983  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
bored to death with my life,

24
00:02:33,023 --> 00:02:35,383  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
(bored to death with myself. )

25
00:02:35,423 --> 00:02:37,499  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
What was that, my love?

26
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:39,099  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nothing. . .

27
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:41,576  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
of consequence.

28
00:02:41,616 --> 00:02:44,134  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Tulkinghorn will be coming soon.

29
00:02:44,174 --> 00:02:47,011  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
Certain legal matters
to discuss, he says.

30
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:50,245  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Perhaps there's been a development
in Jarndyce and Jarndyce.

31
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:54,918  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nothing ever happens with
Jarndyce and Jarndyce. No, well. . .

JUDGE: Now, somewhat to my surprise,

33
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,633  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
something stirs in Jarndyce.

34
00:03:00,673 --> 00:03:04,990  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
It appears that the two young
people, the wards of court

35
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,544  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
who stand at the very
centre of these proceedings,

36
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:10,225  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
are with us today.

37
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:14,898  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
My lord, you were to hear my
case today! Gridley, my lord.

38
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:16,098  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Silence in court! Gridley.

39
00:03:16,138 --> 00:03:19,215  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
I have a right to be heard, my lord.
I have waited long enough.

40
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:21,891  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Quiet, sir, quiet. Keep it down.

41
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:26,489  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
An application has been made for
them to reside with their cousin -

42
00:03:26,529 --> 00:03:30,087  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
a Mr John Jarndyce.

43
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,961  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Will your lordship allow me?

44
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:35,475  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
The two young people are here,
my lord.

45
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:40,270  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:400 Y2:523
And there is a third young person, my lord.
A third young person?
Not another ward in court?

46
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:45,665  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
No, m'lud. Engaged as companion
to this young lady, and seeking
your lordship's approval.

47
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:47,303  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Very well. Is she here, too?

48
00:03:47,343 --> 00:03:49,191  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
On her way, m'lud.

49
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:01,050  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Miss Barbary. . .

50
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,048  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
will you tell me, who am I, exactly?

51
00:04:04,088 --> 00:04:05,655  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who are you?

52
00:04:05,695 --> 00:04:09,838  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're nobody. You're nothing.
You're worse than nothing.

53
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:14,836  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
It would have been far better
if you'd never been born. Why?

54
00:04:14,876 --> 00:04:17,353  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is it because of my mother?

55
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:20,630  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Did she die because of me?

56
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:25,420  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
Your mother, Esther,
is your disgrace. . .

57
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:28,661  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
 .and you hers.

58
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,897  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're different
from other children, Esther.

59
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:35,263  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
YOU are set apart.

63
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:57,668  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523

64
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,756  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
There. Here we are.

65
00:04:59,796 --> 00:05:03,224  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Bring down Miss Summerson's
box and follow us, my man.

66
00:05:03,264 --> 00:05:05,589  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now, will you take me arm, Miss?

67
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:07,859  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:523
We don't wanna lose ya, do we, Miss?

Oh! Have a care there, sir.
I do beg your pardon.

70
00:05:15,091 --> 00:05:17,811  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
I beg your pardon.

71
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,473  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Are you all right?
Quite all right, thank you.

72
00:05:22,642 --> 00:05:24,860  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then no harm done.

73
00:05:27,956 --> 00:05:28,991  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good day to you.

74
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,789  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523

Well, Jo, how are you?

76
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:39,394  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
You know me, sir. I never vary.

77
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:43,461  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've nothing to give you now, Jo,

78
00:05:43,501 --> 00:05:45,857  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
but I'll look out
for you on my way back.

79
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:48,325  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're very good, sir.

82
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:16,549  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
Very elegantly done,
if I may say so.

83
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:23,099  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:416 Y2:523

85

Careful how you spend it now.

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:36,738  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
What's it to you
how I spend it, Mr Snagsby?
Nothing at all, I'm sure, Mr Nemo.

87
00:06:38,318 --> 00:06:40,491  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523

00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:16,399  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is Mr Kenge's room.

Er, take this armchair by the
fire, if you will. Thank you.

92
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:21,113  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Kenge is in court now.

93
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:26,151  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
He left his compliments and would
you partake of some refreshment,
and look over the paper if you will.

94
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:29,148  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, thank you, Mr. . . Guppy.

95
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:32,745  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Thank you, Mr Guppy.
Oh, not at all, Miss, I'm sure.

96
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,022  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're going before
the Chancellor, I hear.

97
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:37,779  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
A claimant in Jarndyce
and Jarndyce, I dare say?

98
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:40,216  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't know. I don't think so.

99
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:45,491  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
But Mr John Jarndyce. . .
There. . . Mr John Jarndyce. You see?

100
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,924  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
He's right at the heart of the case,
and it is a very great case,
Miss Summerson.

101
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:51,721  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
The most famous case in Chancery.

102
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:53,207  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gone on for many years.

103
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:57,995  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Some say it will never be settled,
and a great deal of money
depends on it, Miss Summerson.

104
00:07:58,035 --> 00:08:00,841  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hundreds  of thousands.
Millions, some say.

105
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:05,670  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
I have heard of it, Mr Guppy,
but I don't understand it at all.

106
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,747  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's  about a will, Miss.
Or a number of 'em.

107
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:15,018  X1:106 X2:611 Y1:416 Y2:523
A long time ago, a man named Jarndyce
made a great fortune, but he seems
to have made more than one will.

108
00:08:15,058 --> 00:08:18,134  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
So, no-one knows
who should get the money,

109
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:20,253  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
and it's been in dispute ever since.

110
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:24,648  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:416 Y2:523
There are lots of claimants,
and the claims get passed
down through the generations.

111
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:31,159  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:416 Y2:523
There's two young people appeared in
court today and they are at the heart
of it, like your Mr John Jarndyce.

112
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,442  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
They say one of 'em may get the lot,
but you never know.

113
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:39,510  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
You may have a claim yourself,
Miss Summerson, if Mr Jarndyce
has sent for you.

114
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:44,588  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523
And, may I say, I wish you the very
best of good fortune, Miss Summerson.

115
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:47,025  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you, Mr Guppy.

116
00:08:47,065 --> 00:08:51,219  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Er, you see there's a
looking-glass there on the wall?

117
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:57,093  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
Yes? In case you should want to look
at yourself after the journey, as
you're going before the Chancellor.

118
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:59,339  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
Er, not that it's
requisite, I'm sure.

119
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:03,025  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's very much to the
contrary, if I may say so.

120
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,876  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, no. Oh.

121
00:09:12,798 --> 00:09:13,998  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mortifying.

122
00:09:14,038 --> 00:09:15,991  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
(Mortifying. )

123
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,957  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's only an ink-stain,
is it not, Mr Guppy?

124
00:09:18,997 --> 00:09:23,747  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:416 Y2:523
That must be a regular hazard,
I would have thought,
in your line of business.

125
00:09:23,787 --> 00:09:26,704  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't upset yourself, I beg you.

126
00:09:26,744 --> 00:09:28,861  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're very kind, Miss Summerson.

127
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,874  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Kinder than I could have. . .

128
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:34,255  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Miss Summerson.

129
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:38,529  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ah, Mr Kenge. Miss Summerson.

130
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:40,417  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Shall we go before the Chancellor?

131
00:09:53,874 --> 00:09:55,182  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mortifying.

132
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:14,715  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Miss Clare? Miss Ada Clare?

133
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:20,321  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, well. You are
a ward of court, Miss Clare.

134
00:10:20,361 --> 00:10:23,961  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Do you know what that means?
I'm not sure that I do, sir.

135
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:29,520  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
You and Mr Carstone, both being
orphaned, you have been placed
under the jurisdiction of the court.

136
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:35,154  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:416 Y2:523
As claimants in the case,
as direct descendents of the
original John Jarndyce

137
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:39,622  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
of Bleak House in Hertfordshire,
now long deceased,

138
00:10:39,662 --> 00:10:43,821  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
you may inherit a very great
deal of money,

139
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:47,622  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
one or both of you,
when this case is settled.

140
00:10:47,662 --> 00:10:52,170  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
In the meantime, your cousin,
also called John Jarndyce,

141
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,443  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
also residing at Bleak House,
has undertaken to take care of you.

142
00:10:56,483 --> 00:11:00,839  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Are you willing to go to
Bleak House, Miss Clare? Yes, sir.

143
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:03,557  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
It sounds dreary to me.

144
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,724  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not dreary at present, my lord.

145
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:12,152  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Richard Carstone? Yes, my lord.

146
00:11:12,198 --> 00:11:18,025  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
Do you think that you will be
happy under the roof of Mr
John Jarndyce of Bleak House?

147
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:20,101  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sure I shall, my lord.

148
00:11:20,141 --> 00:11:21,955  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Though  you have never met him?

149
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:29,693  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hmm.

150
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:34,243  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr John Jarndyce is a man
of good character, I suppose?

151
00:11:34,283 --> 00:11:37,881  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Of excellent character and high
standing in the community, my lord.

152
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:40,638  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
He has the means to look
after these two young people?

153
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:44,813  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:416 Y2:523
No matter what the outcome
of the case, he is a man
of considerable means.

154
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:48,148  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is he married?

155
00:11:48,188 --> 00:11:49,911  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
He is not, my lord.

156
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:02,658  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
Hmm. If I might remind your
lordship, Mr Jarndyce provides a
suitable companion for Miss Clare.

157
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:06,130  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
This is the young lady,
Miss Summerson.

158
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,688  X1:316 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
I see.

159
00:12:11,528 --> 00:12:13,602  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Very well.

160
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:15,839  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
I shall make the order.

161
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,898  X1:078 X2:345 Y1:488 Y2:523
INDISTINCT CHATTER

162
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:22,234  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, what a day this has been.

163
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,630  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Only yesterday, on the old school
bench construing Latin verses,

164
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,337  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
today I'm Mr Richard Carstone,
heir to a fortune.

165
00:12:29,468 --> 00:12:31,625  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
So where do we go
next, Miss Summerson?

166
00:12:31,665 --> 00:12:34,581  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't YOU know? Not in the least.

167
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:37,379  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're like the babes in the wood.

168
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:40,575  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
Have you known each other very long?
Not very long.

169
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:45,450  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
We met each other half an hour
before we met you, Esther, but
we're the best of friends already.

170
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,684  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm sure all three of us shall be.
Oh! The wards in Jarndyce.

171
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:52,921  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Very happy, I'm sure,
to have the honour.

172
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:56,475  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's a good omen for youth
and hope and beauty

173
00:12:56,515 --> 00:13:00,115  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
to find themselves in this place and
not know what's to come of it.

174
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,392  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
I was a ward myself, you know.

175
00:13:02,432 --> 00:13:05,709  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Of course, my case was
nothing like so grand as yours,

176
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:09,662  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
but I expect a judgement shortly,
on the Day of Judgement.

177
00:13:09,702 --> 00:13:12,706  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now don't be troublesome,
Miss Flite, there's a good soul.

178
00:13:12,746 --> 00:13:16,538  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ah, here's your cab. You're to lodge
with Mrs Jellyby tonight.

179
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:20,054  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
A good soul, and a great
philanthropist. Guppy will take you.

180
00:13:20,094 --> 00:13:22,890  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ah, yes, indeed.

181
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:26,162  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, Miss Clare and Mr Carstone.

182
00:13:26,202 --> 00:13:29,042  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Miss Summerson.

183
00:13:29,082 --> 00:13:31,919  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Up we go. We all in?

184
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:34,275  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Off we go, driver.

185
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:35,754  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Walk on.

186
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,803  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Clamb?

187
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,618  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Fetch the Jarndyce documents.

188
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:54,819  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Going down to Chesney Wold, sir?

189
00:13:54,859 --> 00:13:58,293  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mmm. A fine house, I understand, sir.

190
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:02,563  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Very fine house, very great family.

191
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:05,884  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
A great privilege to serve
Sir Leicester Dedlock, Clamb.

192
00:14:05,924 --> 00:14:08,601  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
And Lady Dedlock, sir.

193
00:14:08,641 --> 00:14:10,998  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
A great beauty in her day, sir.

194
00:14:11,038 --> 00:14:13,634  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mmm, a beauty.

195
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:17,081  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not from a great family,
but a beauty, as you say.

196
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:21,177  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's the world.

197
00:14:22,706 --> 00:14:26,927  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Fetch the papers, Clamb.
Right you are, Mr Tulkinghorn.

198
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:33,754  X1:078 X2:239 Y1:488 Y2:523
CHILD CRIES

199
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:38,248  X1:078 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Guppy, whatever's the matter?

200
00:14:38,288 --> 00:14:43,121  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
Don't be frightened, Miss. One of
the young Jellybys has got
his head through the railings.

201
00:14:43,161 --> 00:14:45,759  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, poor child. Oh, never fear.

202
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:48,760  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll pull him out, Miss Summerson.

203
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,913  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh. Move. 'Ere y'are.

204
00:14:50,953 --> 00:14:54,314  X1:078 X2:247 Y1:488 Y2:523
CHILD WAILS

205
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,947  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
No go. I'll try again.

206
00:14:57,987 --> 00:15:02,145  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Guppy! Mr Guppy. Would it not be
better to push?

207
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:04,702  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where his head will go,
the rest of him will follow.

208
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:08,736  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, excellent thought,
Miss Summerson.

209
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:10,376  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gently, don't be frightened.

210
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:13,532  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Er, wriggle your
shoulder a little bit sideways.

211
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:15,246  X1:078 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
CHILD CONTINUES TO WAIL

212
00:15:15,286 --> 00:15:18,693  X1:078 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
There, that's it. There, we got him!

213
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:21,440  X1:078 X2:257 Y1:488 Y2:523
DOOR OPENS

214
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,280  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ah, Miss Clare. Miss Summerson.

215
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,067  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr  Carstone.
Do, please, come inside.

216
00:15:36,109 --> 00:15:40,544  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
This way, my dears.
You find me, as usual, very busy.

217
00:15:40,584 --> 00:15:43,940  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
My Africa project
employs my whole time.

218
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,777  X1:078 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
THUD, FOLLOWED BY CHILD CRYING

219
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:50,811  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
We hope by this time next
year to have 200 families

220
00:15:50,851 --> 00:15:54,604  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
cultivating coffee, and educating
the natives of Borrioboola-Gha.

221
00:15:54,644 --> 00:15:56,762  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Great work, great work.

222
00:15:56,802 --> 00:16:01,198  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
My husband, Mr Jellyby,
does not appear to be here.

223
00:16:01,238 --> 00:16:06,675  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
But here is my eldest
daughter Caddy, my amanuensis.

224
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:09,150  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do please sit while I, er. . .

225
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,830  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where were we, Caddy?

226
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,903  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm sure YOUR thoughts have often
turned to Africa, Miss Summerson.

227
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:19,741  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
The finest climate in the world.
Caddy?

228
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:23,418  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mrs Jellyby presents her
compliments to Mrs Swallow. . .

229
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:26,175  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ma. Now what is it?

230
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:29,210  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, Peepy, not on any account.

231
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,646  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mama is busy.

232
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:36,723  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
You, Mrs Swallow, I know,
share my deeply held conviction

233
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:41,478  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
about Africa, the essential
Brotherhood of Humanity,

234
00:16:41,518 --> 00:16:44,515  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
and it is with this understanding. . .

235
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:47,871  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can't keep up, Ma. Go slower.

236
00:16:52,465 --> 00:16:53,985  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
And. . .

237
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:58,649  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
it is with this understanding. . .

238
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,454  X1:078 X2:295 Y1:488 Y2:523
KNOCK AT DOOR

239
00:17:02,494 --> 00:17:04,454  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
(May I come in for a minute? )

240
00:17:04,494 --> 00:17:06,727  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've been working late.

241
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,725  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
No need to tell me that.

242
00:17:08,765 --> 00:17:10,604  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
I wish Africa was dead.

243
00:17:10,644 --> 00:17:14,779  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look at my fingers.
It won't come off.

244
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,592  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's very pretty. Yes, she is.

245
00:17:21,632 --> 00:17:24,591  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's an orphan, ain't she?

246
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:27,227  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes. I wish I was an orphan.

247
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:30,106  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ma's a disgrace. I wish I was dead.

248
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:33,781  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
I wish we were all dead. It would be
a great deal better for us.

249
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:36,660  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't tell me it wouldn't,
it would. Caddy, I'm sure. . .

250
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,975  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'm so angry with Ma. She makes
such an ass of herself over Africa,
and Pa does nothing at all.

251
00:17:42,015 --> 00:17:45,866  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:416 Y2:523
Really, Caddy, I don't think
you should speak of
your parents like that.

252
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:51,240  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
I  know I am a disgrace,
Miss Summerson.

253
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,877  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
I wish I'd had you to teach me
better manners, but I've got to
make the best of myself as I am.

254
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:58,434  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're shocked, I dare say.

255
00:17:58,474 --> 00:18:00,951  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, so am I.

256
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:03,533  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
I wish. . . Well, never mind.

257
00:18:08,226 --> 00:18:09,750  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
Goodnight.

258
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,265  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here we are, my beauties!

259
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:23,648  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hope. Joy.

260
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:27,721  X1:078 X2:449 Y1:452 Y2:523
Youth. Ah. . .
SHE WHISTLES

261
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:30,999  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Peace. Rest. Life.

262
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,236  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oooh, shh, shh, shh, shh. . .

263
00:18:33,276 --> 00:18:36,308  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dust. Ashes. Waste.

264
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:39,874  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Want. . .

265
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,510  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ruin, Despair.

266
00:18:46,824 --> 00:18:49,381  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Madness.

267
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,538  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Death.

268
00:18:51,578 --> 00:18:53,575  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cunning and Folly.

269
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:58,768  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
We shall all have a judgement
on the Day of Judgement.

270
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:03,723  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Plunder, Precedent, Jargon,
Gammon and Spinach.

271
00:19:03,763 --> 00:19:08,308  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
And then you shall sing to your
heart's content, my little ones.

272
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:11,674  X1:078 X2:269 Y1:488 Y2:523
SHE WHISTLES

274
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,223  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh!

275
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,837  X1:078 X2:321 Y1:488 Y2:523
SHE HUMS A TUNE

276
00:19:24,343 --> 00:19:27,744  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
# And we'll all come to
judgement one day soon. #

277
00:19:29,179 --> 00:19:31,297  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Morning.
Off to court then, Miss Flite?

278
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,051  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:523
As you see, Mr Krook. And your rent?

279
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:36,248  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Very soon, Mr Krook, very soon.

280
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:38,048  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
On the Day of Judgement, yeah?

281
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:40,444  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, long before then, I'm sure.

282
00:19:40,484 --> 00:19:43,121  X1:078 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
LOUD HISS
All right, Lady Jane?

283
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:46,558  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
She could tear a person
to tatters if I set her on.

284
00:19:46,598 --> 00:19:50,353  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
D'you know, she was
sold to me for her skin.

285
00:19:50,393 --> 00:19:52,433  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's a very fine one as you see.

286
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:55,110  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
Didn't have it in
me heart to skin her.

287
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:58,347  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not like the Court of Chancery, eh?

288
00:19:58,387 --> 00:20:00,067  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not as long as I get what I'm owed.

289
00:20:00,107 --> 00:20:02,304  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Krook,

290
00:20:02,344 --> 00:20:05,701  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
I have met the wards in Jarndyce.

291
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:08,658  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Wards in Jarndyce, is it?
Such beautiful creatures.

292
00:20:08,698 --> 00:20:13,048  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
So full of youth and hope and beauty.
Oh, and they won't have it long.

293
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:16,686  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
That Jarndyce and
Jarndyce eats 'em all up.

294
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:19,523  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's like being ground
to bits in a slow mill.

295
00:20:19,563 --> 00:20:23,493  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's being drowned by drips and
going mad by grains.

296
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:28,474  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look how poor Tom Jarndyce ended up.
Mr Krook, don't speak of it.

297
00:20:28,514 --> 00:20:32,869  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come in my shop, right where
you stand, a pistol in his hand.

298
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:36,029  X1:078 X2:479 Y1:452 Y2:523
Please, Mr Krook.
SHOP DOOR BELL CLANGS

299
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,109  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh!

300
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:38,792  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Nemo.

301
00:20:40,302 --> 00:20:42,739  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good morning, Miss Flite.

302
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:44,457  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Krook.

303
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:48,096  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Er, forgive me but I'm
rather pressed for time.

304
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:51,527  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rent, Mr Nemo. Six weeks.

305
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,964  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
As long as that?

306
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,645  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, you shall have it.

307
00:20:55,685 --> 00:20:58,841  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah, that's all very well,
but when?

308
00:20:58,881 --> 00:21:02,083  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
You will be paid, Mr Krook.

309
00:21:04,075 --> 00:21:05,884  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
You have my word.

310
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,786  X1:308 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now. . .

311
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,488  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
 .excuse me.

312
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:17,264  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, he's such a gentleman.

313
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:19,971  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
A gentleman? That's no use to me.

314
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:23,891  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Some people say that he
sold his soul to the devil.

315
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:26,849  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
But if he has, I don't know
what he done with the money!

316
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,999  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
My very best remembrances
to my good friend Mr Jarndyce.

317
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:58,115  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
You won't forget me,
will you, Miss Summerson?

318
00:21:59,576 --> 00:22:01,828  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come, Caddy, we have work to do.

319
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:16,199  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, driver.

320
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:18,497  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go on, move on.

321
00:23:20,847 --> 00:23:23,808  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
We have a visitor.

322
00:23:23,848 --> 00:23:26,965  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can you see who it is, my love?

323
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:29,297  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Tulkinghorn. Ah.

324
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,100  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Tulkinghorn. Sir Leicester.

325
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,820  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:452 Y2:523
Good of you to
come all this way.

326
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,292  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
My lady's case has been again
before the Chancellor, has it? Yes.

327
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,132  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
It was on again yesterday, my lord.

328
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:58,049  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
My lady.

329
00:23:58,089 --> 00:24:01,805  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:416 Y2:523
It would be useless to
ask, no doubt, whether
anything has been done.

330
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:05,600  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nothing that you would
call anything has been done.

331
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,160  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nor ever will be. Mmm.

332
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,276  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, a long Chancery suit is very
much in the way of things, my dear.

333
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:13,354  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hardly be proper if it weren't.

334
00:24:13,394 --> 00:24:17,989  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
Indeed, my lord. Now, as a few
fresh affidavits have been
put upon the file,

335
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:20,548  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
and as I proceed upon the principle
that my client

336
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:24,460  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
should be fully possessed of all the
new developments in the case. . .

337
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,803  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
All right, Mr Tulkinghorn.

338
00:24:31,333 --> 00:24:35,588  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
I, er. . . I have the papers here,
if I might. . .

339
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:37,887  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you.

340
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:43,761  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
In Chancery, between John Jarndyce. . .
Mr Tulkinghorn, please.

341
00:24:43,801 --> 00:24:46,878  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Omit as many of the formal
horrors as you can.

342
00:24:49,996 --> 00:24:52,044  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
As your ladyship pleases.

343
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:09,099  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who copied that?
Hmm? Whose handwriting is it?

344
00:25:11,852 --> 00:25:16,765  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
I regret to say I have
no idea, my lady.

345
00:25:16,805 --> 00:25:19,598  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is this what you call law-hand?

346
00:25:21,043 --> 00:25:22,761  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why do you ask?

347
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:27,594  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Anything to vary this
detestable monotony.

348
00:25:27,634 --> 00:25:29,482  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, go on, do.

349
00:25:33,111 --> 00:25:35,568  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Very well. Er. . .

350
00:25:37,545 --> 00:25:41,595  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
In the matter of the will, or wills,
of the aforesaid John Jarndyce. . .

351
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,025  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
My lady? What's the matter?

352
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:50,647  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
My dear, what is it?
What's the matter?

353
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:52,287  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Lady Dedlock is ill, sir.

354
00:25:52,327 --> 00:25:56,747  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm just. . .faint.
Help Lady Dedlock to her room.

355
00:25:58,082 --> 00:25:59,970  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Careful. Careful, gently now.

356
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,119  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Heat of the fire, perhaps.

357
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:04,632  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Far too much for her.

358
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:32,726  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
I mean it! Nemo, no more excuses!

359
00:26:32,766 --> 00:26:35,468  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
The money by tomorrow
or you're on the street!

360
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:50,867  X1:078 X2:245 Y1:488 Y2:523
COINS CLINK

361
00:27:40,612 --> 00:27:47,846  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:416 Y2:523
Thank you, sir. Those papers I took
down to Lady Dedlock at Chesney Wold,
where were they copied?

362
00:27:47,886 --> 00:27:51,560  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
That depends, Mr Tulkinghorn. They
came from several of our regulars.

363
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,552  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, that one, for instance.

364
00:27:55,797 --> 00:27:57,513  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll check, sir.

365
00:27:57,553 --> 00:28:01,071  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
It may take a while.
I have to compare the hand.

366
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:04,108  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you, Clamb.

367
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:28,402  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ada, my love. Esther, my dear.

368
00:28:28,442 --> 00:28:31,998  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
You are welcome. I rejoice to see
you. Come inside and get warm.

369
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:35,229  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rick, if I had a hand to spare
at present, I'd give it to you.

370
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:38,605  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come in. Come in.

371
00:28:42,746 --> 00:28:46,273  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
There. Now, make yourselves
comfortable, warm yourselves.

372
00:28:48,897 --> 00:28:51,935  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now, Rick,
I have that hand at liberty.

373
00:28:51,975 --> 00:28:54,532  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
A word in earnest is
as good as a speech.

374
00:28:54,572 --> 00:28:56,649  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am heartily glad to see you.

375
00:28:56,689 --> 00:28:58,529  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are at home.

376
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:00,952  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're very kind, sir.
We're much obliged to you.

377
00:29:02,163 --> 00:29:06,588  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now, come and see your rooms.

378
00:29:13,714 --> 00:29:16,510  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
I wish you'd come away
from the window, my love.

379
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:20,107  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
You must take care for your health.
We don't want you fainting again.

380
00:29:20,147 --> 00:29:22,064  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am perfectly well.

381
00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:26,496  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're still pale, I'm afraid.
Is it any wonder?

382
00:29:26,536 --> 00:29:30,292  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
We have not see the sun for months.
Mmm.

383
00:29:30,332 --> 00:29:33,730  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think I should take
you away for a while.

384
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:35,927  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
Paris, now.

385
00:29:35,967 --> 00:29:39,323  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
A  change of scene that will
lighten both our spirits.

386
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:41,132  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do you say?

387
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,823  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are too good to me. No, no.

388
00:29:47,635 --> 00:29:49,835  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, no, no.

389
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,518  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not at all.

390
00:29:54,469 --> 00:29:57,147  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
D'you think we shall
be happy here, Esther?

391
00:29:57,187 --> 00:29:58,956  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
I think we have been very fortunate.

392
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:02,715  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
Bleak House is not
so bleak after all.

393
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:06,814  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
And do you like Mr Jarndyce?

394
00:30:06,854 --> 00:30:10,852  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think he is a very
singular man indeed.

395
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:15,437  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is that good? I hope so,
we are here now for good or ill.

396
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:22,005  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Esther, why do you think
he's taken us into his care?

397
00:30:26,917 --> 00:30:29,994  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, perhaps it is
nothing but kindness.

398
00:30:30,034 --> 00:30:34,667  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
He has made it very difficult
for us to ask, since he behaves
as if we are all old friends.

399
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,185  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
It is strange.

400
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:38,722  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
But perhaps we shall be good friends.

401
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,257  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do you think we shall, Esther?

402
00:30:42,297 --> 00:30:43,777  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am sure we shall, Ada.

403
00:30:43,817 --> 00:30:45,790  X1:078 X2:397 Y1:452 Y2:523
KNOCK AT DOOR
Yes?

404
00:30:46,732 --> 00:30:51,807  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Miss Summerson? For you, Miss, if
you please. The housekeeping keys.

405
00:30:51,847 --> 00:30:53,965  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
The master said to
bring them to you,

406
00:30:54,005 --> 00:30:58,480  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
then tomorrow morning I'm to
show you the presses
and the things they belong to.

407
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,402  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
For me?

408
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,357  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Really?

409
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,471  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you. Er, and you are. . . ?

410
00:31:06,511 --> 00:31:09,213  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Harriet, Miss. Thank you, Harriet.

411
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,416  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
'You're nobody.'

412
00:31:18,456 --> 00:31:20,814  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're nothing.
You're worse than nothing.

413
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:23,654  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
It would have been far better
if you'd never been born.

414
00:31:23,694 --> 00:31:26,157  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Esther, what is it? Nothing.

415
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:32,304  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm surprised anyone should trust
me so much, knowing me so little.

416
00:31:34,043 --> 00:31:36,136  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Shall we go down?

417
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:43,952  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:416 Y2:523
As far as worldly matters are
concerned, I am but a child,
a perfect child.

418
00:31:43,992 --> 00:31:45,990  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ah, our little party is complete.

419
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:50,228  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ada, Esther. . . Allow me to
introduce myself. Harold Skimpole.

420
00:31:50,268 --> 00:31:53,745  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
A dear friend and house guest,
for the present, of Mr Jarndyce.

421
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:56,858  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now, you ask my profession.
No profession whatsoever.

422
00:31:56,898 --> 00:32:00,252  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
I have no aptitude for
worldly affairs, none at all.

423
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:02,890  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
There, that's Harold Skimpole
for you.

424
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,330  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
How do you do, Mr Skimpole?
Very well indeed. . .

425
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:11,206  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
thanks to my excellent friends,
of whom John Jarndyce is one of
the very best and kindest. Well. . .

426
00:32:11,246 --> 00:32:15,791  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
Shall we go in? Miss Clare,
would you do me the honour? Hmm?

427
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,194  X1:078 X2:337 Y1:488 Y2:523
THUNDER RUMBLES

428
00:32:21,234 --> 00:32:23,149  X1:078 X2:329 Y1:488 Y2:523
THUNDER CRASHES

429
00:32:23,189 --> 00:32:24,909  X1:078 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Will you wait there, please, sir?

430
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:26,592  X1:078 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll go and ask the housekeeper.

431
00:32:34,377 --> 00:32:36,834  X1:078 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Guppy? I've never heard of him.

432
00:32:39,331 --> 00:32:42,048  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
M'lord and Lady Dedlock
are away in Paris, sir.

433
00:32:42,088 --> 00:32:45,405  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
They left this afternoon.
The house is all shut up.

434
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:51,358  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
Ah, er, my principal, Mr Kenge,
has letters of affidavit
for Lady Dedlock's attention.

435
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:54,956  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can leave them with me, sir,
I'll see she gets 'em. Ah, right.

436
00:32:54,996 --> 00:33:00,509  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:416 Y2:523
Er, begging your pardon most
profoundly for the unsociable
lateness of the hour,

437
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:03,708  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
owing to my having got lost
in very unfamiliar country,

438
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:08,021  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
I wonder, ma'am, if I might. . .
throw myself upon your mercy.

439
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:11,180  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
You want to be allowed to stay
the night? In a word, ma'am.

440
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,696  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
All right, Mr Guppy. So long as you
don't mind sleeping with the boots.

441
00:33:14,736 --> 00:33:16,209  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Show him the way, Rosa.

442
00:33:21,888 --> 00:33:24,004  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
I covet nothing.

443
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:28,240  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Possessions are nothing to me.
I live as innocently as a child.

444
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,757  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Forgive me, sir, did you never. . .
wish you had a house of your own,

445
00:33:31,797 --> 00:33:33,754  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
and a wife and children
of your own?

446
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:39,268  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why, bless you, my dear fellow.
I have a wife, and children.

447
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:42,986  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, half a dozen I should say,
or more. And love them very dearly.

448
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:46,380  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
But how do you look after them?
Look after them?

449
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,495  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, how could I? You see, I have
no aptitude for work of any kind.

450
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:54,370  X1:114 X2:603 Y1:452 Y2:523
None whatsoever. My friend Skimpole
needs somebody to look after HIM.

451
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,692  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then how do your children live, sir?

452
00:34:01,685 --> 00:34:03,282  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do you know, I've no idea.

453
00:34:03,322 --> 00:34:05,519  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
But live, they do, somehow or other.

454
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:07,719  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's no use asking me
how these things are done.

455
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,036  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
I am a child, a perfect
child, in these matters.

456
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:13,594  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think your life must be a
very pleasant one, Mr Skimpole.

457
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:16,470  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, yes, you might think that.

458
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:21,260  X1:078 X2:425 Y1:452 Y2:523
PIANO MUSIC: Adagio from
"Pathetique" by Beethoven

459
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,486  X1:078 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
A lovely young creature like that.

460
00:34:36,526 --> 00:34:39,204  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
We will not call her an orphan.

461
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:42,801  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
She. . . is a child of the universe.

462
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:46,198  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
The universe makes rather an
indifferent parent, I'm afraid.

463
00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:50,134  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, I don't know. I think I DO know.

464
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:09,331  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, this is something,
I should say.

465
00:35:09,371 --> 00:35:12,688  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
The portrait is of Lady Dedlock
as a young woman.

466
00:35:12,728 --> 00:35:16,485  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's considered a perfect likeness,
and the best work of the master.

467
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:21,079  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dear me! That's Lady Dedlock, is it?

468
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,515  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Blest if I can ever have seen her. . .

469
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,733  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
yet I know her.

470
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:30,441  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm dashed if I don't think. . .

471
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:35,710  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
I must have had a dream
of that picture, you know?

472
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:50,848  X1:078 X2:295 Y1:488 Y2:523
KNOCK AT DOOR

473
00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:55,764  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523
If you please, Miss,
Mr Carstone said would you
come to the dining room.

474
00:35:55,804 --> 00:35:57,760  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Skimpole's been took, Miss.

475
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,422  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Took? Took, Miss. Sudden.

476
00:36:09,388 --> 00:36:12,664  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh. I understood you were. . .

477
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,860  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are not ill, Mr Skimpole?

478
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,496  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not in the least, Miss Summerson.

479
00:36:18,536 --> 00:36:21,454  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
We thought you might be
able to advise us, Esther.

480
00:36:21,494 --> 00:36:24,852  X1:078 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
This gentleman is Mr Neckett.
NECKETT COUGHS

481
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:28,448  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Skimpole has been
arrested for debt.

482
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:30,765  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you arrested for much, sir?

483
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:32,722  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:488 Y2:523
My dear Miss Summerson, I don't know.

484
00:36:32,762 --> 00:36:37,318  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Er, some pounds, odd shillings and
a ha'penny were mentioned, I think.

485
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:40,835  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
24 pound, 16 and sevenpence
ha'penny, that's what it is.

486
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:44,751  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
What will happen if the money is not
produced, sir? Jail. Or Coavinses.

487
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:47,110  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Er, may I ask what is. . .

488
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,944  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Coavinses, Miss?
Halfway house for debtors, Miss.

489
00:36:49,984 --> 00:36:52,821  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
I thought, you see,
that Mr Carstone might,

490
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:56,615  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
or his beautiful young cousin, might
sign some sort of a bond or pledge.

491
00:36:56,655 --> 00:37:01,492  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not a bit of it. It's cash
or Coavinses. Make your mind up.

492
00:37:01,532 --> 00:37:03,744  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
One moment, please, Mr Neckett.

493
00:37:09,766 --> 00:37:11,320  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why are WE drawn into this?

494
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,561  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
He feels a delicacy about
applying to Mr Jarndyce. . .

495
00:37:14,601 --> 00:37:17,557  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Done it too many times before,
no doubt. He has no right.

496
00:37:17,597 --> 00:37:19,980  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know, but what are we going to do?

497
00:37:22,191 --> 00:37:24,204  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think we must pay the man,
if we can.

498
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,942  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
I have 10 Mr Kenge gave me.
I must try what that will do.

499
00:37:28,982 --> 00:37:31,445  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
I have 15 and a few shillings.

500
00:37:32,899 --> 00:37:34,218  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
My life savings.

501
00:37:34,258 --> 00:37:36,925  X1:078 X2:411 Y1:452 Y2:523
HE SIGHS
Esther.

502
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,872  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
And this is the laundry room, Miss.

503
00:38:37,912 --> 00:38:40,147  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you, Harriet.

504
00:38:40,187 --> 00:38:43,862  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Everything is just as it should be.
Thank you, Miss. Esther?

505
00:38:43,902 --> 00:38:45,500  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Would you step in here a moment?

506
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:57,168  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sit down, my dear.

507
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:02,882  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
This, you know, is the Growlery.

508
00:39:02,922 --> 00:39:05,962  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
When I'm out of humour,
I come here and growl.

509
00:39:06,002 --> 00:39:07,759  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then you must be here very seldom.

510
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:09,396  X1:078 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
HE LAUGHS
You don't know me.

511
00:39:09,436 --> 00:39:12,353  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
When I'm deceived or disappointed,
when the wind is in the east. . .

512
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:14,430  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Er, now. . .

513
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:19,343  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
what is this I hear about Rick and
yourself and Mr Skimpole last night?

514
00:39:19,383 --> 00:39:22,701  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Are you angry with us? No! You?
No, bless you, no!

515
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:25,018  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
To get hold of the pair of you
and squeeze you

516
00:39:25,058 --> 00:39:27,656  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
like a couple of young oranges,
that was very bad of him.

517
00:39:27,696 --> 00:39:29,812  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
But there must be no
more of it, Esther.

518
00:39:29,852 --> 00:39:34,328  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
If I choose to support him, that's
another thing altogether. 15, was it

519
00:39:34,368 --> 00:39:36,445  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here you are.

520
00:39:36,485 --> 00:39:41,769  X1:108 X2:609 Y1:452 Y2:523
And keep it safe. Safe from our
friend Skimpole's inexperience. Hmm?

521
00:39:43,203 --> 00:39:44,727  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you.

522
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:50,601  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is it, Esther?

523
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:55,352  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't understand why
you're so good to us.

524
00:39:57,462 --> 00:39:59,980  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well. . .

525
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,300  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
that's easy.

526
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,696  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
In your case, I. . .

527
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:07,015  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
I hear of a young woman
without a protector,

528
00:40:07,055 --> 00:40:10,731  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
and I take it into my head
to be that protector.

529
00:40:10,771 --> 00:40:15,285  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
And Richard and Ada? They've gone
into this dreadful thing through no
fault of their own.

530
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:18,842  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
They need help to guide them
through it. Through Chancery?

531
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:21,639  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
I wish I could guide
them far away from it.

532
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:24,476  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Jarndyce and Jarndyce has
ruined better men than me.

533
00:40:24,516 --> 00:40:27,313  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
The years go by, the claims are
passed down generations,

534
00:40:27,353 --> 00:40:30,100  X1:114 X2:447 Y1:452 Y2:523
and we can't get out of it,
none of us, on any terms.

535
00:40:31,627 --> 00:40:36,181  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
My great uncle, Tom Jarndyce, was
brought to despair by it and. . .

536
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:38,069  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
blew his own brains out.

537
00:40:40,178 --> 00:40:42,965  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
I was his heir. This was his home.

538
00:40:44,452 --> 00:40:46,732  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
When I came here
it was bleak indeed.

539
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:49,568  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
And when I brought. . .

540
00:40:49,608 --> 00:40:51,485  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
what remained of him. . .

541
00:40:51,525 --> 00:40:57,599  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
home here, I thought the brains
of the house had been. . .

542
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:00,022  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
blown out too.

543
00:41:00,957 --> 00:41:03,289  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
It was so shattered and ruined.

544
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:09,072  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then you must have made
great changes, sir.

545
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:17,660  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yes, yes, and in myself, too,
as far as I've been able to.

546
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:20,416  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
But I determined never to be
drawn into this case,

547
00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:23,214  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
with its false hopes
and ruined expectations.

548
00:41:23,254 --> 00:41:25,291  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
I am fortunate I have enough
to live upon,

549
00:41:25,331 --> 00:41:30,485  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
and to help others, too, without
tormenting myself with dreams of. . .

550
00:41:30,525 --> 00:41:33,362  X1:078 X2:363 Y1:488 Y2:523
HE KNOCKS ON TABLE

551
00:41:33,402 --> 00:41:36,398  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, I told you this
was the Growlery,

552
00:41:36,438 --> 00:41:38,901  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
and I think we may have
done with it for one day.

553
00:41:40,396 --> 00:41:45,151  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
I am very glad to have you
here with me, Esther.

554
00:41:46,627 --> 00:41:50,781  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
You and. . . Rick and Ada.

555
00:41:50,821 --> 00:41:53,739  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
Do you think that you
will all be happy here?

556
00:41:54,662 --> 00:41:57,039  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes, sir, I think so.

557
00:41:57,975 --> 00:42:01,422  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
And is there anything I could do
to make you more. . .sure of that?

558
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:08,166  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
I have been told that I was
my mother's disgrace,

559
00:42:08,206 --> 00:42:11,443  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
and she is mine.

560
00:42:11,483 --> 00:42:12,843  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do you know what was meant?

561
00:42:12,883 --> 00:42:16,279  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I assume what was meant is that
I was born out of wedlock.

562
00:42:17,997 --> 00:42:20,625  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
But I should like to
know who my mother was. . .

563
00:42:22,114 --> 00:42:25,745  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
 .and whether she still lives. Ah.

564
00:42:25,785 --> 00:42:29,500  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
That I cannot tell you, Esther.

565
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,231  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Your aunt chose not to tell you
and her secret died with her.

566
00:42:35,454 --> 00:42:37,797  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
It may be for the best.

567
00:42:42,367 --> 00:42:44,365  X1:314 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hmm.

568
00:42:44,405 --> 00:42:46,094  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gallant conduct.

569
00:42:49,481 --> 00:42:51,121  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bravery.

570
00:42:51,161 --> 00:42:53,453  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
You don't see this one very often.

571
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,833  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Your own, sir, are they?

572
00:42:57,873 --> 00:43:01,599  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:488 Y2:523
How much? To pawn, or sell outright?

573
00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:04,705  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sell outright.

574
00:43:08,258 --> 00:43:10,601  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Eight pound.

575
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:21,406  X1:078 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
CLAMB CLEARS HIS THROAT

576
00:43:21,446 --> 00:43:23,283  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Those papers, Mr Tulkinghorn,

577
00:43:23,323 --> 00:43:26,603  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
that you took to Lady Dedlock,
the one you were interested in.

578
00:43:26,643 --> 00:43:28,720  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
It was copied at Snagsby's.

579
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:32,474  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
You quite sure of that? Was there
some complaint about them, sir?

580
00:43:32,514 --> 00:43:35,074  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
None at all.

581
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:38,510  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
Quite the contrary.
That's all, Clamb.

582
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:46,178  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Mrs Pardiggle has threatened to
call. I'm afraid she may insist on
taking you on her rounds.

583
00:43:46,218 --> 00:43:48,058  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
What rounds would those be, sir?

584
00:43:48,098 --> 00:43:50,776  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Charitable rounds, Rick.

585
00:43:50,816 --> 00:43:54,250  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Will you be embarking on this
charitable expedition, Mr Skimpole?

586
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,167  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
I? Oh, no.

587
00:43:56,207 --> 00:43:59,648  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, I have nothing to give,
but myself.

588
00:43:59,688 --> 00:44:04,642  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
And Mrs Pardiggle I find a woman
best admired, er, from a distance.

589
00:44:08,196 --> 00:44:10,676  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's the cause we're engaged on,
Mrs Pardiggle?

590
00:44:10,716 --> 00:44:13,392  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
Visiting a poor family
of brick makers.

591
00:44:13,432 --> 00:44:15,546  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
The father is a very bad character,

592
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:19,784  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
but I believe I have made
great strides with them already.

593
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:21,467  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
They love to see me, you know.

594
00:44:30,015 --> 00:44:32,518  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come in, come in.

595
00:44:34,888 --> 00:44:37,926  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, my friends, I am here again.

596
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,483  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
There ain't any more
of you, is there?

597
00:44:40,523 --> 00:44:42,719  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
You won't put me off, good people.

598
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:46,397  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
I enjoy hard work, and the harder
you make mine, the better I like it.

599
00:44:46,437 --> 00:44:49,234  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now, did you read the
little book I left with you?

600
00:44:49,274 --> 00:44:51,827  X1:078 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
No. I've been drunk for three days.
BABY CRIES

601
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:53,945  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
If I had the money,
I'd have been drunk four.

602
00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:57,501  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Have I been to church? No, I ain't.

603
00:44:57,541 --> 00:45:00,699  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
How did my wife get that black eye?

604
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,336  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why, I gives it to 'er.

605
00:45:02,376 --> 00:45:05,976  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
And if there's anyone else
who wants one, you say the word.

606
00:45:06,016 --> 00:45:11,211  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, if that's the way,
perhaps we should move on.

607
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:14,927  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
There are others more
deserving of our attention.

608
00:45:14,967 --> 00:45:17,245  X1:078 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
BABY CONTINUES TO CRY

609
00:45:17,285 --> 00:45:18,965  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Is there anything we can do?

610
00:45:19,005 --> 00:45:21,078  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Would you like a doctor
for the baby?

611
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:23,137  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think it's gone too late
for that, Miss.

612
00:45:30,506 --> 00:45:32,679  X1:078 X2:229 Y1:488 Y2:523
SHE GASPS

613
00:45:45,412 --> 00:45:47,710  X1:078 X2:229 Y1:488 Y2:523
SHE GASPS

614
00:45:49,769 --> 00:45:53,125  X1:078 X2:215 Y1:488 Y2:523
SHE SOBS

615
00:45:55,883 --> 00:45:59,774  X1:078 X2:229 Y1:488 Y2:523
SHE KEENS

616
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,617  X1:078 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
We can do no more for now, Esther.

617
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,321  X1:078 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
MOTHER CONTINUES TO CRY

618
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:43,550  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Damn you, boy!

619
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:47,264  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sorry, sir, I. . . Damn your sorry,
you little blackguard. Leave it!

620
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,301  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Or you will deal with me!

621
00:46:55,257 --> 00:46:58,813  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, Jo, how are you?

622
00:46:58,853 --> 00:47:00,496  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not so bad, thanks, sir.

623
00:47:02,011 --> 00:47:03,933  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here.

624
00:47:05,606 --> 00:47:07,335  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Take care of yourself, Jo.

625
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:18,234  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, here you are. How did you
like Mrs Pardiggle's charity?

626
00:47:18,274 --> 00:47:21,028  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not at all, sir. Oh, Lord, I
shouldn't have let you go.

627
00:47:21,068 --> 00:47:25,064  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're distressed. Our distress
is nothing. But theirs is. . .

628
00:47:25,104 --> 00:47:28,223  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can nothing be done to help them?
I think something must be done.

629
00:47:28,263 --> 00:47:32,457  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
But now, Esther, if you feel up to
it, you have a visitor. A visitor?
For me?

630
00:47:32,497 --> 00:47:35,096  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
A Mr Guppy. Mr Guppy?

631
00:47:35,136 --> 00:47:37,373  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Of Kenge and Carboys? Mmm.

632
00:47:37,413 --> 00:47:42,857  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:416 Y2:523
Doesn't it concern us all?
Miss Esther Summerson, on a personal
and confidential matter, he said.

633
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:00,503  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Miss Summerson.

634
00:48:02,025 --> 00:48:04,583  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Will you take some refreshment?

635
00:48:04,623 --> 00:48:06,540  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, thank you.

636
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,043  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll take a glass of wine.

637
00:48:09,978 --> 00:48:11,661  X1:078 X2:381 Y1:488 Y2:523
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

638
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:18,668  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Miss Summerson. . .

639
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:21,052  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Er. . .

640
00:48:24,561 --> 00:48:26,779  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is it, Mr Guppy?

641
00:48:30,715 --> 00:48:36,867  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
My present salary
is two pound a week, and I expect
a further rise of five shillings.

642
00:48:36,907 --> 00:48:41,985  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:523
My mother has a little
property, which takes the
form of a small life annuity.

643
00:48:42,025 --> 00:48:44,582  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Guppy, I don't understand. . .
Er, Miss Summerson. . .

644
00:48:44,622 --> 00:48:47,259  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
In the mildest language. . .

645
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,136  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
I ADORE you.

646
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:55,050  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now would you be so kind as to
allow me to make a declaration. . .

647
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:59,447  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
To make an offer?

648
00:48:59,487 --> 00:49:01,870  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get up, please, Mr Guppy.

649
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,308  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
I won't hear any more unless you do.

650
00:49:08,955 --> 00:49:10,234  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
I will, Miss.

651
00:49:10,274 --> 00:49:14,146  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
As I love and honour,
so likewise I obey.

652
00:49:14,186 --> 00:49:17,467  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm sorry, Mr Guppy, but I can't
marry you. It's out of the question.

653
00:49:17,507 --> 00:49:21,180  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm aware that,
in a worldly point of view,

654
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:24,497  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
my offer may seem a poor one. . .
No, it isn't that, Mr Guppy. . .

655
00:49:24,537 --> 00:49:27,015  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
 . but I have been brought
up in a sharp school.

656
00:49:27,055 --> 00:49:31,051  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've ferreted out evidence,
and got up cases.

657
00:49:31,091 --> 00:49:33,889  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
What means might I not find of
advancing your fortunes,

658
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:37,526  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
if I had your confidence, and you
was to set me on? Please stop,
Mr Guppy. . .

659
00:49:37,566 --> 00:49:42,040  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
I have walked up and down,
of an evening, opposite Jellyby's,

660
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,795  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
only to look upon the bricks
that once contained thee.

661
00:49:45,835 --> 00:49:47,711  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Miss Summerson,

662
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:49,884  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
have pity on me.

663
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:54,384  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Guppy, I don't want to disappoint
you, or to cause you pain,

664
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:56,887  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
but you must understand
that I don't. . .

665
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:03,695  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
 .and couldn't. . .

666
00:50:03,735 --> 00:50:05,253  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
love you.

667
00:50:09,929 --> 00:50:13,205  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
I thank you for your
good opinion of me.

668
00:50:17,801 --> 00:50:22,317  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
And that is your final answer?

669
00:50:22,357 --> 00:50:24,235  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes.

670
00:50:24,275 --> 00:50:27,429  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Er, half a minute, Miss. . .

671
00:50:27,469 --> 00:50:31,269  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
In case you should think better
at any time,

672
00:50:31,309 --> 00:50:35,603  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
for MY feelings can never alter. . .

673
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:42,300  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
 . Mr William Guppy,
87 Penton Place, will suffice.

674
00:50:44,253 --> 00:50:46,292  X1:298 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
My card.

675
00:50:46,332 --> 00:50:48,795  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Without prejudice.

676
00:50:56,603 --> 00:50:59,060  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
My angel.

678
00:51:12,865 --> 00:51:15,699  X1:078 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bless my soul, sir. Mr Tulkinghorn.

679
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:19,216  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
I want half a word with you, Snagsby.
Jarndyce and Jarndyce.

680
00:51:19,256 --> 00:51:22,092  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Everything's satisfactory,
I hope, Mr Tulkinghorn?

681
00:51:22,132 --> 00:51:25,969  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
You copied some affidavits in
that cause for me lately. Yes, sir.

682
00:51:26,009 --> 00:51:29,120  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
There was one of them,
the handwriting of which is peculiar.

683
00:51:32,161 --> 00:51:34,680  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who copied this? Ah.

684
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,730  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
We gave this out, sir.
It'll be in the book.

685
00:51:42,908 --> 00:51:46,071  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jarndyce. Here we are, sir.

686
00:51:48,423 --> 00:51:53,380  X1:116 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
This was given out to a writer who
lodges just opposite. Name of Nemo.

687
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:57,217  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nemo? Nemo is Latin for "no-one".

688
00:51:57,257 --> 00:52:00,491  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
He lodges just opposite?
Above Krook's bottle shop.

689
00:52:00,531 --> 00:52:05,208  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
Will I take you there? No trouble.
No trouble at all, sir. No,
Snagsby, that will not be necessary.

690
00:52:05,248 --> 00:52:07,645  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
I was simply curious, that's all.

691
00:52:07,685 --> 00:52:11,786  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:452 Y2:523
Good evening, Snagsby. Good evening,
Mr Tulkinghorn. Much obliged to you.

00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:21,662  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Krook? That's me.

694
00:52:23,384 --> 00:52:25,544  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523

695
00:52:25,584 --> 00:52:27,901  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Male or female? Male.

696
00:52:27,941 --> 00:52:30,059  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's in.

697
00:52:30,099 --> 00:52:32,579  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Did you want to see him? Yes.

698
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:34,706  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then you'd best go up.

00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:41,443  X1:284 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thank you.

Mr Nemo?

703
00:52:53,912 --> 00:52:55,396  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you there?

704
00:53:11,416 --> 00:53:12,940  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Opium.

705
00:53:19,449 --> 00:53:21,167  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mr Nemo?

706
00:53:24,562 --> 00:53:26,860  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello, my friend.

707
00:53:36,147 --> 00:53:39,344  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:488 Y2:523
The man called Nemo, Mr Tulkinghorn.

708
00:53:39,384 --> 00:53:41,582  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
He pawned some medals
the day he died.

709
00:53:41,622 --> 00:53:45,497  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:452 Y2:523
One of them was inscribed with
the name of Captain Hawdon. Hawdon!

710
00:53:45,537 --> 00:53:48,776  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
A welsher! A bilker! A defalcator!

711
00:53:48,816 --> 00:53:51,292  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Owes me hundreds of
pounds, and gone to ground.

712
00:53:51,332 --> 00:53:53,092  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bad debt. Bad debt. I hate 'em !

713
00:53:53,132 --> 00:53:56,089  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
You, boy. Come here. Here!

714
00:53:56,129 --> 00:53:58,246  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
I ain't done nothing, sir.

715
00:53:58,286 --> 00:54:01,977  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
What do you do here?
Let the boy go, Mr Tulkinghorn.

716
00:54:02,924 --> 00:54:05,001  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're frightening him.

717
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:09,232  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
He is the very kindest of physicians
in all the world.

718
00:54:09,272 --> 00:54:11,589  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
He will have his reward
on the Day of Judgement.

719
00:54:11,629 --> 00:54:14,269  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
I shall never be a
person of consequence.

720
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:18,462  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
No? Well, you'll have to allow
me to disagree with you, then.

721
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:22,728  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think you like Mr Woodcourt
a great deal, don't you? I did.

722
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:27,413  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, Ada, if only life could
be like this all the time.

723
00:54:27,453 --> 00:54:31,634  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, it could, couldn't it? Perhaps.

724
00:54:34,287 --> 00:54:37,365  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:523
I love him so much, Miss Summerson.

725
00:54:37,405 --> 00:54:40,682  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, Lor', that's his dad.

726
00:54:40,722 --> 00:54:43,503  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
Strike home, sir. Strike home.

727
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:48,389  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
Delighted to welcome you to the
mysteries of our profession,
Mr Carstone.

728
00:54:48,429 --> 00:54:50,987  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Richard Carstone, MRCS.

729
00:54:51,027 --> 00:54:52,987  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
I suppose there is. . .

730
00:54:53,027 --> 00:54:55,984  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
rather a lot of blood. But don't let
me discourage you.

731
00:54:56,024 --> 00:54:59,178  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've been thinking that the law

732
00:54:59,218 --> 00:55:02,011  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
is the boy for me. The law?

733
00:55:04,095 --> 00:55:06,372  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tell you the truth,
I can't make head nor tail of it.

734
00:55:06,412 --> 00:55:09,729  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
And, er, what profession have
you settled upon this time?

735
00:55:09,769 --> 00:55:10,798  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Army, sir.

736
00:55:12,766 --> 00:55:15,324  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
All these costs, costs,
costs and nothing is done.

737
00:55:15,364 --> 00:55:18,521  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nothing is for nothing, as they say.

738
00:55:18,561 --> 00:55:23,155  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Might I ask, Miss Summerson,
what YOUR family was?

739
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:26,921  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
I never knew my mother or
my father, Mrs Woodcourt.

740
00:55:33,145 --> 00:55:35,783  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is to be hushed up if it can be.

741
00:55:35,823 --> 00:55:39,456  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
I am not sure that I could
do that, Mr Tulkinghorn.

742
00:55:39,496 --> 00:55:41,174  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
You must, Lady Dedlock.

743
00:55:41,214 --> 00:55:46,009  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
For the sake of the family honour,
you must.

744
