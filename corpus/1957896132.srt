1
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:32,704
Dad, yeah, I just
gotta turn in this paper,

2
00:00:32,728 --> 00:00:34,817
and I will meet you
guys at the ferry.

3
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:38,038
Yes, of course I
brought the champagne.

4
00:00:39,778 --> 00:00:40,778
Oh, sorry.

5
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:44,174
Listen, I gotta go, okay?

6
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:45,262
Bye.

7
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:47,542
Oh!

8
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:48,325
Are you okay?

9
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:49,457
Yeah, fine.

10
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:53,503
You...

11
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:58,814
Um, um, your teeth.

12
00:01:59,597 --> 00:02:01,033
Well, I am English.

13
00:02:01,904 --> 00:02:03,253
No, they're covered in blood.

14
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:04,733
Oh.

15
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:05,776
Oh.

16
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:11,566
I think I might need
to go to the doctor.

17
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:19,617
Hey, I'm at the clinic.

18
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:20,923
No, no, I'm okay.

19
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:22,620
I just ran into
someone on my way

20
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:24,100
to turn in my assignment.

21
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,059
Like, literally
ran into someone.

22
00:02:27,103 --> 00:02:29,018
He's asleep or passed
out or something.

23
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,241
Yeah, he's cute.

24
00:02:35,242 --> 00:02:36,156
Stop it.

25
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,418
Okay, have fun in Greenwich,

26
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:39,550
and I'll try to meet
you when I can, okay?

27
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:41,291
Bye.

28
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:51,693
Oh, sorry.

29
00:02:51,736 --> 00:02:52,955
Did I scare you?

30
00:02:52,998 --> 00:02:55,087
No, I was just surprised.

31
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:56,131
Yeah.

32
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,266
Me too.

33
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:02,312
You have a little...

34
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,185
Oh, oh.

35
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:10,015
All right, let's get this out.

36
00:03:10,059 --> 00:03:11,191
How's it feel?

37
00:03:11,234 --> 00:03:12,234
Yeah.

38
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,933
Ooh.

39
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:16,283
Well, it looks pretty good.

40
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:17,545
I should probably get going.

41
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:19,286
You two took knocks to the head.

42
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,548
- Really?
- Mm, yeah.

43
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:22,724
One too many in
your case, it seems.

44
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,334
You likely have
minor concussions,

45
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:26,902
and I'd like you to do
neurological checks every 4 hours.

46
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:28,271
I have some pamphlets
that'll walk you through it.

47
00:03:28,295 --> 00:03:29,295
Wait, even me?

48
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,257
That's a good
question, actually.

49
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:39,175
Because evidently you have
a particularly thick skull,

50
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,569
so it might not be necessary.

51
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:43,179
But you know what?

52
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,143
Let's be safe and just
do what I tell you, okay?

53
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:46,965
All right, well...

54
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:48,271
Oh, that lip actually.

55
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:49,379
It's gonna be tender
for a few days,

56
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:50,839
so go easy on him?

57
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:52,406
Oh, no-

58
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,384
- Paracetamol for the pain
and I'll be right back

59
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:55,408
with your pamphlets.

60
00:03:56,453 --> 00:03:57,453
Thank you!

61
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:03,373
So, um...

62
00:04:04,766 --> 00:04:06,724
Do you really think I'm cute?

63
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,293
You heard that?

64
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:11,773
Yeah.

65
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:13,557
Can I get your number?

66
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:14,601
Yeah, sure.

67
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:17,735
Would you mind passing
me my phone, it's-

68
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,302
- Oh, yeah.

69
00:04:19,346 --> 00:04:20,346
Thank you.

70
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:28,355
Oh, no.

71
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:29,443
What's wrong?

72
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:31,445
I'm late.

73
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:32,272
- Oh, no-
- I'm sorry!

74
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,838
But you...

75
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:35,425
You haven't learned how to
do your neurological check...

76
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:36,537
Yet.

77
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:38,645
Where on Earth are you going?

78
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:41,368
Sorry, thank you!

79
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:43,370
Why, hello, Miss Master of Art.

80
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:47,025
We haven't graduated yet.

81
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:48,133
Wait, what are you doing here?

82
00:04:48,157 --> 00:04:49,463
Oh, I didn't get his number.

83
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:50,290
What?

84
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,203
I know.

85
00:04:51,247 --> 00:04:51,987
I lost track of time and-

86
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,901
- Ugh!

87
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:54,182
I had to get my assignment in,

88
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:55,358
so I just had to leave
there in a hurry.

89
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:57,209
Well, easy come, easy go.

90
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
Oh...

91
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:05,174
Is that all I get?

92
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:06,784
Well, that's why
I'm glad you came.

93
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:07,568
The champagne!

94
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:08,960
Oh, I totally forgot.

95
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:10,527
The others-

96
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:11,354
- Here.

97
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:12,616
Oh, thanks.

98
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,444
They went somewhere to
find a liquor store.

99
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:15,706
Wait, where is it?

100
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,621
I don't know,
across the commons?

101
00:05:17,665 --> 00:05:19,797
No, no, where is my journal?

102
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:22,104
It's not here, I must've
left it at the clinic.

103
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:23,671
It's got my whole year in there!

104
00:05:23,714 --> 00:05:25,150
Well, it'll still be there.

105
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:27,109
We'll go back, I'll go with you.

106
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:28,719
After my champagne.

107
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,504
Okay.

108
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,420
Be careful!

109
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:39,295
Where have you been?

110
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,601
Having a jolly time, I hope?

111
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:42,472
Yeah, I was at the
university doctors.

112
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:43,430
Oh.

113
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:44,735
Here's the-

114
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,060
- If I'd known you were
gonna take that long,

115
00:05:46,084 --> 00:05:47,323
I'd of just brought it
after my class finished.

116
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,348
This is your diary.

117
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,523
Hm?

118
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:50,741
Oh, sorry.

119
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:53,048
Here it is.

120
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:54,745
I made a few notes,
nothing too major,

121
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:56,921
but just take a look and
let me know what you think.

122
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:57,705
Where's Richard?

123
00:05:57,748 --> 00:05:58,923
Richard?

124
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:00,577
He's still in
Prague, 'til Saturday.

125
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:01,796
Oh, of course he is.

126
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:02,579
I forgot.

127
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:03,798
What's this?

128
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:04,949
What was I coming over here for?

129
00:06:04,973 --> 00:06:06,409
A cup of tea?

130
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:08,759
Oh, yes, please, Harry.

131
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,108
Thank you.

132
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:11,434
James, what were you
doing at the hospital?

133
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:13,198
Oh, that is really sweet.

134
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:14,635
I ran into someone.

135
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:16,419
Head first, I presume.

136
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:17,202
Yeah.

137
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,246
Why?

138
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,770
Oh, dear.

139
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,557
Oh...

140
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,125
We clean it after every
visit, there's nothing here.

141
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:28,909
Except that.

142
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:31,584
Look, are you ready to learn

143
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:33,001
how to do a neurological check?

144
00:06:34,263 --> 00:06:35,090
Sure.

145
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,133
Good.

146
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:48,102
Hello?

147
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:51,018
Is anybody there?

148
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:55,283
I'll sort it.

149
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:57,373
Um, James?

150
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,417
I think you should wait.

151
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:20,352
Did you get your assignment in?

152
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:21,396
Yeah.

153
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:23,137
I found this.

154
00:07:23,878 --> 00:07:25,270
Yeah.

155
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:26,315
I've got this.

156
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:32,364
Should we get a drink?

157
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,672
I have to learn my
neurological check.

158
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:36,716
Oh.

159
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,739
How about a walk in
the park, tomorrow?

160
00:07:39,763 --> 00:07:42,810
A walk in the
park would be great.

161
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:44,289
Oh.

162
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,769
Why are you here?

163
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,989
I forgot something important.

164
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:49,251
Oh, gross.

165
00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:50,339
Go on, out you go.

166
00:07:50,382 --> 00:07:51,514
No, no, I need to get-

167
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:52,472
- Please, please!
- Out, out!

168
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:53,603
- Out!
- What are you doing?

169
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:54,798
You're supposed to be a doctor.

170
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:56,606
Meet me tomorrow at
the cafe Tea Darling.

171
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,260
I don't want tea with you!

172
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,959
Sorry about that.

173
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:03,004
Tea Darling?

174
00:08:13,754 --> 00:08:14,754
You look better.

175
00:08:15,886 --> 00:08:17,148
No, I don't.

176
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:18,933
But thank you for trying.

177
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,414
I'm a little bit hungover.

178
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,547
You know, we had our
finals yesterday, so.

179
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,549
Oh, there's a doctor
on campus who specializes

180
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:28,551
in people with your condition.

181
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:30,595
I think the treatment
might be worse than the cure.

182
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:33,295
Come on, I know
what will fix ya.

183
00:08:41,782 --> 00:08:44,219
Oh, it's the other
way around, actually.

184
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,751
Now that is the best
hangover cure in the world.

185
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:55,709
Trust me.

186
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:57,537
A bit of salt, carbs, grease.

187
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:00,278
You'll be good as
gold in no time.

188
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:03,673
I am supremely
jealous right now.

189
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:07,372
So, you come here often?

190
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,374
Mm, all the time.

191
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:10,593
I love it.

192
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:11,681
Here?

193
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:15,642
It's just so adorable.

194
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:17,034
Yeah.

195
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,078
It's Tea Darling.

196
00:09:27,131 --> 00:09:30,178
Yeah, so I'm not
technically a student.

197
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:34,095
By which I mean, I'm not
actually a student at all.

198
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,707
I work at this
startup ad agency,

199
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:39,666
and we have this graphic
design grad student

200
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:40,623
interning with us,

201
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:43,670
so he prints things for me.

202
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:44,627
Isn't that stealing?

203
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:46,847
Nana says stealing is wrong.

204
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,805
Will, they're on a date!

205
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:50,632
Sorry.

206
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:52,634
Will, that was rude.

207
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:54,898
Get off me, Sophie!

208
00:12:24,178 --> 00:12:26,658
So, is this J your signature?

209
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:27,877
Yeah.

210
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:29,923
Yeah, I Photoshop it
into all the campaigns.

211
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,797
Oh.

212
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,103
Oh, I love this one.

213
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,671
Have it.

214
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:40,715
I think I have...

215
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:43,109
Oh, yeah.

216
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:47,375
I can't take this.

217
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:49,333
No, please.

218
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:51,031
I would like you to.

219
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:52,772
I don't particularly want it.

220
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,038
Yeah, but, you've
been hiding something

221
00:12:58,081 --> 00:13:00,780
behind your back for
about a minute now,

222
00:13:00,823 --> 00:13:03,957
which I can only
presume is a gift,

223
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,133
and if you accept that,

224
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:08,372
then I get to to take credit
for giving you the first gift,

225
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:11,529
even though I didn't
actually get you anything.

226
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:14,749
Here.

227
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,708
Thank you.

228
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:21,712
Oh.

229
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,412
This is beautiful.

230
00:13:25,892 --> 00:13:28,329
Puts mine to shame,
I'm embarrassed.

231
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:30,548
Well, I love your
picture of another woman.

232
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,682
Oh, there it is,
a J on her hand.

233
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:36,511
Why do you put that in?

234
00:13:36,554 --> 00:13:38,730
For fun, I suppose.

235
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:40,384
Not to keep things stimulating?

236
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:42,734
What do you mean?

237
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:45,085
Well, doesn't it get
creatively stifling

238
00:13:45,128 --> 00:13:47,043
working on drill bit campaigns?

239
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:48,479
No.

240
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:51,395
No, the creativity
is in making a sale.

241
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,571
The art is defined
by the outcome,

242
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:57,010
and this is literally art that
moves something, I love it.

243
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,204
Beauty is in the
eye of the beholder,

244
00:13:58,228 --> 00:14:00,883
but art is art in itself.

245
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,711
Is that what that note

246
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:04,713
that you wrote on my work means?

247
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,891
You think we see too much?

248
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:11,720
Well, your whole message is that

249
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:13,480
this company is not
just selling drill bits,

250
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:15,811
but a way through
obstacles, right?

251
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:19,859
This image is awful.

252
00:14:21,077 --> 00:14:22,862
There's nothing
aspirational about it.

253
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:25,865
Punch in with a macro lens

254
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:28,563
and show the spiral thingies...

255
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:29,606
Thread.

256
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,089
Show the thread in a way
that suggests something more.

257
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:36,527
Like a spiral staircase.

258
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:40,967
Yeah, but no, because it's
not always as, you know,

259
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,665
neat as art for art's sake.

260
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,015
The what and the why
can't be separated.

261
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,887
For instance, your
picture, right?

262
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,238
Now, that's obviously
incredibly special to me.

263
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:54,632
To anyone else, that's just a
picture of a building corner.

264
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,113
Is that so?

265
00:14:57,157 --> 00:14:58,462
A lovely picture.

266
00:14:58,506 --> 00:14:59,202
You're darn right.

267
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:00,290
Look.

268
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:01,988
You're the
uncompromising artist,

269
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:03,946
I'm the compromising artist.

270
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,469
You're the starving artist,

271
00:15:05,513 --> 00:15:07,558
I'm the well-fed artist.

272
00:15:07,602 --> 00:15:08,951
No offense.

273
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:10,233
You're right, maybe
I'm clinging to an ideal.

274
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:11,582
Maybe I won't make
a bunch of money,

275
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:14,261
but I believe in what
I do, I'm proud of it.

276
00:15:14,304 --> 00:15:15,915
And you're brilliant at it.

277
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,873
I mean, you'll probably
end up proving me wrong

278
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,529
and become the next
famous photographer.

279
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:22,443
You can't think of any, can you?

280
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:24,314
I don't think they exist.

281
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:26,360
Oh, that is spicy.

282
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,458
Seems like we've run out
of things to talk about.

283
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:38,501
Shut up.

284
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,983
That's another way to put it.

285
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:44,117
- Aw!
- Oh!

286
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,161
- Ow.
- I'm sorry.

287
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:47,337
Please, believe me.

288
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,078
There is nothing
I would like more

289
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:50,950
than to kiss you right now.

290
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,039
I didn't mean to hurt you.

291
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:54,301
It's fine, honestly.

292
00:15:54,344 --> 00:15:56,129
I mean, if you hadn't,
we'd of never of met,

293
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,218
so I'll take it.

294
00:16:01,003 --> 00:16:02,222
Um...

295
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:03,397
Can I see you again?

296
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,488
After your pitch?

297
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:08,663
I'd love that.

298
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,250
Well, do you want
to just meet here

299
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:13,885
and see where the
night takes us?

300
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:17,019
Sure.

301
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:18,151
Do you want my number?

302
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:21,154
No.

303
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:24,244
No, let's do it the
old-fashioned way.

304
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:26,420
It's more romantic.

305
00:16:26,463 --> 00:16:28,117
But what if we
miss each other?

306
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,041
Well, if it's meant to
work, we'll make it work.

307
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,818
James, I'm going back
to the States in two days.

308
00:16:36,517 --> 00:16:38,780
If it's meant to work,
we'll make it work.

309
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:08,940
We love it!

310
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:12,477
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

311
00:17:13,162 --> 00:17:14,250
Thank you.

312
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:15,358
How about we
celebrate with a pint?

313
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:17,297
Oh, actually, I-

314
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,733
- We'll take it from here.

315
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:20,951
We'd love to.

316
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:24,652
Congratulations.

317
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,183
We're selling a means to an end.

318
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:35,010
Another?

319
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,229
Thank you.

320
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:37,708
Let me just put
this one over here.

321
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:40,537
You know, I nearly laughed
when you first said that.

322
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:43,714
But at the end of the day,
they're just drill bits.

323
00:17:43,758 --> 00:17:46,021
But boy, you're onto something.

324
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,110
James is certainly
very competent.

325
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:49,546
He's a wizard.

326
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,244
Don't let go of that one.

327
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,114
Don't worry.

328
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:53,246
I don't intend to.

329
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:54,290
All right.

330
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,596
I'm going to the loo.

331
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:56,790
How many pints
are we gonna have?

332
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:58,077
You have somewhere to be, mate?

333
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,774
Did you change your shirt?

334
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:00,557
Oh, yeah.

335
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:02,255
I wanted to be comfy.

336
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:03,517
Right, yeah.

337
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,867
Well, as a matter of
fact, I've got a date.

338
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,650
Do you?

339
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:07,956
Mhm.

340
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,151
And she goes home
tomorrow, overseas.

341
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:10,959
This might be my last
chance to see her.

342
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:12,178
Who's going overseas?

343
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:14,658
Did you change your shirt?

344
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:16,530
I wanted to be comfy.

345
00:18:16,573 --> 00:18:18,097
So, what?

346
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,880
Are you gonna leave England?

347
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:20,708
I don't know, maybe.

348
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:22,120
We haven't figured
any of that out,

349
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:23,624
that's why I need to go tonight.

350
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:26,888
Wow, you're not kidding.

351
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:28,150
Where's she from?

352
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:29,258
You might need
to cancel, darling.

353
00:18:29,282 --> 00:18:30,152
I can't.

354
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:31,545
But we're celebrating!

355
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:34,765
No, I mean, I
literally can't cancel.

356
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:36,202
I don't have her number.

357
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:38,160
James, blow her off.

358
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:40,182
You're about to close on a
multi-million dollar campaign,

359
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:42,184
and you want to go off
chasing some foreign floozy.

360
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,165
All right, Morgan.

361
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:45,124
Firstly, she's not a floozy.

362
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,038
And secondly, we've
already closed.

363
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:49,215
As I was just
explaining to Henry here-

364
00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:51,086
- It's uh, Harry.
- You can't go...

365
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,348
What?

366
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:54,089
You called me Henry,
but my name is Harry.

367
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,310
As I was just explaining
to lowly, meaningless intern,

368
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:59,877
you can never take a
person at her word.

369
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:02,010
Until the ink is drawn,
you've got nothing.

370
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:03,098
Trust anyone.

371
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,970
This is really
important to me, Morgan.

372
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:07,407
Sorry, James, you're staying.

373
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,757
How about we order
something to eat?

374
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,193
Oh, sounds marvelous.

375
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:13,674
Um, all right.

376
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:16,024
Harry, mate, can you
do me a massive favor?

377
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,373
Yes, of course.

378
00:19:17,417 --> 00:19:18,872
Okay, you know the
bridge over the duck pond

379
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:19,680
in the common?

380
00:19:19,723 --> 00:19:20,942
Yup.

381
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:23,031
I need you to go
there, find the girl.

382
00:19:23,074 --> 00:19:25,294
She's got dark hair,
might be holding a camera,

383
00:19:25,338 --> 00:19:26,730
answers to Edie.

384
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:28,360
I need you to find her,
tell her I'm really sorry

385
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:29,951
I can't make our date tonight,

386
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:32,736
but I will swing by her dorm
first thing in the morning.

387
00:19:33,868 --> 00:19:35,348
You want me to skip dinner?

388
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:36,784
Well, yeah.

389
00:19:36,827 --> 00:19:39,265
I will buy you dinner if
it means that much to you.

390
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:40,440
James, what are you eating?

391
00:19:40,483 --> 00:19:41,397
One minute.

392
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:42,877
Three courses.

393
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,226
What?

394
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,290
You'll buy me a
three course dinner,

395
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:46,924
and I get to pick
the restaurant.

396
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,014
Yeah, whatever.

397
00:19:51,015 --> 00:19:53,235
I'm just kidding James, relax.

398
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,039
You shouldn't seen your
face, two courses is fine.

399
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:56,282
Harry, hurry!

400
00:19:56,325 --> 00:19:58,327
You're gonna be late.

401
00:19:58,371 --> 00:19:59,371
I got it, mate.

402
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:01,243
Trust me.

403
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,287
Excuse me!

404
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:46,375
Edie!

405
00:20:47,985 --> 00:20:49,030
Are you Edie?

406
00:20:49,073 --> 00:20:50,292
Yes.

407
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:51,380
My goodness.

408
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:53,382
I tried the Tube,
but it was late.

409
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:55,123
I ended up getting a taxi.

410
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:55,906
I thought I might've missed you,

411
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,299
but it doesn't matter.

412
00:20:57,343 --> 00:20:59,321
James wanted me to tell
you he can't come tonight,

413
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:00,781
but he'll stop by your dorm

414
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:03,000
first thing in the morning.

415
00:21:03,044 --> 00:21:04,045
Okay, yes.

416
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:05,873
Yes.

417
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,440
Okay, great.

418
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:08,615
It's nice to meet you.

419
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:10,486
One minute, I just
need to send a text.

420
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:14,273
Are you on social media at all?

421
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,578
Cape Town, right?

422
00:21:15,622 --> 00:21:18,102
And there's place
called Shark Bank.

423
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:20,235
500 foot cliffs, straight down.

424
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,541
And the actor's gonna jump...

425
00:21:34,597 --> 00:21:35,511
I just need to make
a stop on the way.

426
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:36,555
Okay.

427
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,352
What is it?

428
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,918
Hi, I'm looking for James.

429
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:37,399
Oh.

430
00:22:37,443 --> 00:22:38,705
You're American.

431
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:40,707
Yes, and I'm on my
way to the airport.

432
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,771
I just wanted to make
sure he got this.

433
00:22:41,795 --> 00:22:42,795
Is he here?

434
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:46,539
Give it to me, darling.

435
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:47,931
I'll make sure he gets it.

436
00:22:47,975 --> 00:22:50,412
Which, I thank you
so much, I just...

437
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:52,980
Hurry up, love!

438
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:55,461
Meter's running, and you've
got a plane to catch.

439
00:22:58,725 --> 00:22:59,508
Who is it?

440
00:22:59,552 --> 00:23:00,596
A girl scout.

441
00:24:03,833 --> 00:24:05,095
Thank you, Mr. Parker.

442
00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:06,270
Have a nice day.

443
00:24:06,314 --> 00:24:07,794
Oh, it'll be delivered
by Wednesday.

444
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,362
How much was that piece?

445
00:24:11,406 --> 00:24:12,494
17.

446
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:14,322
$17,000?

447
00:24:14,365 --> 00:24:15,149
Yup.

448
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:16,498
Can you believe it?

449
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:17,693
It looks like the
artist just threw

450
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:19,240
a bunch of paint on a canvas.

451
00:24:19,283 --> 00:24:20,957
Well, that's an awesome
commission for you.

452
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:22,286
It is.

453
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:25,420
And I would be making
an awesome commission

454
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,726
off of your stuff.

455
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,312
I can't afford to be a
starving artist anymore.

456
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:29,076
Why?

457
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:30,947
It's too unreliable.

458
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:35,517
Product and portrait shots
just pay so much more.

459
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:36,518
Yeah, about that.

460
00:24:36,562 --> 00:24:38,433
How's your mom doing?

461
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,932
She'll be fine once
the divorce is settled.

462
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:41,567
Is it nice living back home?

463
00:24:42,785 --> 00:24:44,371
It's not the word
I'd use to describe it,

464
00:24:44,395 --> 00:24:46,528
but now we're just trying
to move to this house.

465
00:24:47,573 --> 00:24:48,878
Yeah, I get it.

466
00:24:50,358 --> 00:24:51,577
Have you called Noah back?

467
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,882
No.

468
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,207
And don't make me sorry
I told you about that.

469
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:54,971
What?

470
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:56,756
It's a big job!

471
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,235
And it'd give you
breathing room.

472
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:00,150
Jess, it's literally
shooting poop.

473
00:25:00,194 --> 00:25:01,543
Whoa.

474
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:02,936
It's fertilizer, okay?

475
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:04,503
Calm down.

476
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:07,593
And it'd give you freedom
to do other things.

477
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:09,508
You know I'm right!

478
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,683
What does your mom say?

479
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:12,380
She says I should marry him.

480
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,079
Well, I'm sure he'd
be along for the ride.

481
00:25:16,123 --> 00:25:17,254
No, no.

482
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:18,698
See, when the
conversation switches

483
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:20,320
to getting romantically
involved with Noah Pepper,

484
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:21,520
that's my cue to leave.

485
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:22,758
Oh, you mean that's
all I have to do

486
00:25:22,782 --> 00:25:24,324
to get you to stop
loitering around here?

487
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:25,262
Shut up!

488
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:26,612
Call him, Edie!

489
00:25:26,655 --> 00:25:28,091
Honey, just call him.

490
00:25:28,135 --> 00:25:29,876
It will help to talk.

491
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,919
Okay.

492
00:25:32,008 --> 00:25:33,880
I hear you, universe.

493
00:25:33,923 --> 00:25:36,056
I guess I'm calling Noah Pepper.

494
00:25:40,364 --> 00:25:41,104
Pepper Poop.

495
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:42,671
This is Penny.

496
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:45,805
Hi, this is Edie Stevens
returning Noah Pepper's call.

497
00:25:45,848 --> 00:25:46,848
Edie Stevens!

498
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,721
Yes.

499
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:49,896
Can I put you on a...

500
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:51,245
Can I put you on a brief hold?

501
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:52,289
Uh, sure.

502
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:53,334
Okay, thank you.

503
00:25:56,337 --> 00:25:57,643
Noah?

504
00:25:57,686 --> 00:25:58,818
Noah, hi.

505
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:01,753
Edie Stevens is on the phone.

506
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:03,387
Edie's on the phone?

507
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:04,431
Yeah.

508
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,956
Okay.

509
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Okay.

510
00:26:09,176 --> 00:26:09,916
Oh boy.

511
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:10,959
Um...

512
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,136
This is really good.

513
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,050
Okay, I'll talk
her off hold then.

514
00:26:14,094 --> 00:26:16,052
No, I'll do it.

515
00:26:16,096 --> 00:26:18,315
Um, excuse me.

516
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,145
Uh, which button do I press?

517
00:26:22,189 --> 00:26:23,059
This one right here.

518
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:24,167
No, no, no, don't touch it!

519
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:27,107
I just need a moment to prepare.

520
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,150
Sure, sure, sure.

521
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:31,806
Okay.

522
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:34,114
Can we practice, is that okay?

523
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:34,897
Yeah.

524
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:35,811
Can we...

525
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:38,597
You'll be Edie, I'll be Noah.

526
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,641
Okay.

527
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:42,165
Edie, hi.

528
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:43,689
How are you?

529
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:44,733
Good.

530
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:46,213
She doesn't sound like that.

531
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:48,563
Sorry.

532
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,477
Can you just sound a
little more like her?

533
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,000
Sound like you're trying...

534
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:52,132
Can you just...

535
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:53,524
Just work with me here.

536
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,568
Edie, hi.

537
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,180
Hi, Noah.

538
00:26:57,224 --> 00:26:58,747
Oh, that's pretty good.

539
00:26:58,791 --> 00:27:01,010
Edie, I've been following
you since high school.

540
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:02,684
Been following your
work since high school.

541
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:03,665
Yeah.

542
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:04,884
Um...

543
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:06,668
Been following your
work since high school.

544
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:10,672
I noticed you'd take
pictures really well,

545
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:13,588
and, that's stupid,
I need a mint.

546
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,415
Do you have a mint?

547
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:15,416
Do we have any mints?

548
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:16,199
Let me check.

549
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:17,548
Do we have any mints?

550
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:20,639
We had a candy drawer
here for years, Penny.

551
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:23,293
And I told you you could
rearrange the office,

552
00:27:23,337 --> 00:27:24,599
but it's a big deal to me

553
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,837
that we keep up
with consistency.

554
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:27,733
It's fine, it's fine,
it's fine, I'm sorry.

555
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:28,690
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

556
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:29,822
No, I'm sorry.

557
00:27:29,865 --> 00:27:31,650
I shouldn't of, I
know, you know...

558
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:33,955
Edie.

559
00:27:35,001 --> 00:27:38,700
I was wondering if we
could grab food to eat?

560
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:44,488
I like it.

561
00:27:44,532 --> 00:27:45,402
I don't know, sometimes
I feel like maybe

562
00:27:45,446 --> 00:27:46,534
that's a little too flashy.

563
00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:47,274
Okay.

564
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:48,579
Yeah, maybe not.

565
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:49,818
Well, now you got me in my head.

566
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:51,974
Is it not too flashy
or is it too...

567
00:27:52,018 --> 00:27:53,280
I like it.

568
00:27:53,323 --> 00:27:55,021
Okay, well I know
Antonio's is fine.

569
00:27:55,064 --> 00:27:56,109
I need to, um...

570
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:58,372
I need the blood on my...

571
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:02,637
I didn't do any of my
cardio today, excuse me.

572
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,571
Could I just have a little
bit of space, please?

573
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:05,834
- Yeah, definitely.
- I'm so sorry.

574
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:06,989
You're doing a great job.

575
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:08,730
- Definitely.
- You're doing a great job.

576
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:09,774
Thanks.

577
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,257
Is this too tight?

578
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:15,519
It's too tight.

579
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:16,216
I can't do it in
your office, Penny.

580
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:17,347
Okay, um...

581
00:28:19,828 --> 00:28:22,178
Dinner, do we want
to have dinner?

582
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:23,614
I want to offer you a job.

583
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:27,444
I want to offer you a job.

584
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:29,011
I want to offer you a job.

585
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:29,925
Yeah.

586
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:32,667
I want to offer you a job.

587
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,712
Mhm.

588
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:34,755
Mhm.

589
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:36,889
Mm.

590
00:28:38,412 --> 00:28:39,412
Okay.

591
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,417
I'm ready.

592
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,460
Okay.

593
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,029
This one, right?

594
00:28:48,074 --> 00:28:48,988
There.

595
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:49,771
It's the one on the left.

596
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:50,772
This one, right here.

597
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,816
Right.

598
00:28:57,953 --> 00:28:59,389
Oh my gosh, Noah.

599
00:28:59,433 --> 00:29:00,433
You're killing me!

600
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:05,874
So, when this
campaign launched...

601
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:06,832
Geez, I was 17.

602
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:09,008
So, 12 years ago?

603
00:29:09,051 --> 00:29:09,965
Yeah.

604
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:12,054
It has that vibe.

605
00:29:12,098 --> 00:29:14,665
I remember your M&amp;M
phase in school.

606
00:29:14,709 --> 00:29:15,709
Phase?

607
00:29:18,234 --> 00:29:19,670
I'm joshin' ya.

608
00:29:19,714 --> 00:29:22,282
Gosh, it's so good to see you.

609
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:23,587
How are you?

610
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:24,631
How's Susan?

611
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:26,895
Mom sends her love, of course.

612
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:29,419
I mean, she's thrilled
we're working together.

613
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:31,204
Mom's great, thanks.

614
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:33,423
Yeah, and it has been a while.

615
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:35,251
It has, hasn't it?

616
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:37,776
You know, I keep on passing
your studio in town,

617
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:38,951
and I think to myself,

618
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:41,649
"I should go in and say hi."

619
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:42,911
But I know you're so busy

620
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:43,912
running the business
and everything,

621
00:29:43,956 --> 00:29:45,131
I mean your life is insane.

622
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:47,132
Certainly is.

623
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:49,264
So...

624
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,268
So, what should we do?

625
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:54,879
With the campaign?

626
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:59,667
Uh, I'm used to working
with smaller business,

627
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,190
like much smaller.

628
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:03,018
And you're turning around, what?

629
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:05,151
330 million and change.

630
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:08,023
Wow, yeah.

631
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:09,982
That's a lot more...

632
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,940
You're a much bigger company

633
00:30:11,984 --> 00:30:13,681
than I'm used to working with.

634
00:30:13,724 --> 00:30:16,466
Have you thought about bringing
an ad company on board?

635
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,381
Like, people who do
this for a living?

636
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:19,992
Oh, I have one already,

637
00:30:20,035 --> 00:30:21,230
I went with a British company.

638
00:30:21,254 --> 00:30:23,082
Kind of glam up our
image a bit, you know?

639
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,735
Great.

640
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:25,736
So, what am I doing?

641
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,303
Well, you're gonna shoot it.

642
00:30:27,347 --> 00:30:28,870
Look, I know you're
not an advertiser,

643
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:32,352
but I remember our
senior year art class.

644
00:30:32,395 --> 00:30:33,266
Oh, Noah.

645
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:34,876
You've got a darn good eye!

646
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,444
And I want you on my team.

647
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,055
You don't need me-

648
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:43,450
- I need someone I trust
looking out for me.

649
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,409
You know, truth be told, Edie.

650
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:48,498
I'm scared of you
creative types.

651
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:51,501
I mean, you're so cool
with your crazy hair

652
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:54,200
and old-school fashion.

653
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:55,897
I don't have either
of those things.

654
00:30:55,941 --> 00:30:59,335
But you know people who
do, and you understand them.

655
00:30:59,379 --> 00:31:01,860
Should I put that on my resume?

656
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:02,903
Why?

657
00:31:03,644 --> 00:31:05,080
It was a joke.

658
00:31:06,473 --> 00:31:08,040
See?

659
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,931
I didn't even get that, but
you speak their language.

660
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:12,087
I believe it's called English?

661
00:31:17,614 --> 00:31:18,615
That...

662
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:21,618
That's funny.

663
00:31:21,662 --> 00:31:22,662
English.

664
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,490
That's good.

665
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:32,020
Edie, I need you to keep
an eye on these guys.

666
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:36,068
Be my woman on the
inside, so to speak.

667
00:31:36,111 --> 00:31:38,200
We can't have another
campaign like the last one.

668
00:31:38,244 --> 00:31:40,072
I mean, it was terrible.

669
00:31:47,122 --> 00:31:48,122
All right.

670
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,954
Welcome to the
Pepper Poop family.

671
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,918
Maybe we could go out
to dinner this Friday.

672
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:01,441
Celebrate.

673
00:32:01,484 --> 00:32:02,484
Sure.

674
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,270
Edie.

675
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:09,144
Edie!

676
00:32:09,188 --> 00:32:10,339
Do you really have
to do that right now

677
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:12,582
while we're trying
to eat breakfast?

678
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:13,975
No, Mom, I'm eating breakfast.

679
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:16,369
You're still on one of
your intermittent fasts.

680
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:19,826
I mean, it's the best
way to lose weight.

681
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,219
Until you read about the
next one in a magazine.

682
00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:22,592
Hey, if I could lose weight,

683
00:32:22,636 --> 00:32:23,767
I could be a cougar.

684
00:32:29,164 --> 00:32:30,164
Yeah.

685
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:32,602
Hold that thought.

686
00:32:56,365 --> 00:32:57,976
Mm!

687
00:32:58,019 --> 00:32:59,281
Look what you made me do.

688
00:33:03,068 --> 00:33:04,504
Edie?

689
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:07,159
Honey?

690
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:08,682
Are you okay?

691
00:33:08,725 --> 00:33:09,596
Holy-

692
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:10,510
- Poop.

693
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:13,078
Tons and tons of poop.

694
00:33:13,121 --> 00:33:15,123
You know, people really
underestimate it.

695
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:17,169
But I always say that
if you want to go green,

696
00:33:17,212 --> 00:33:18,735
you gotta go brown first!

697
00:33:21,216 --> 00:33:24,045
Oh, you know, I could get
you a salad if you'd like.

698
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:25,177
Oh, no, that's okay.

699
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,352
Are you sure?

700
00:33:26,395 --> 00:33:27,395
Okay.

701
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:30,965
And I said "Careful
mate, that's my face!"

702
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,098
Do you believe that?

703
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:35,056
He nearly took my
face off, he did.

704
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:37,405
Edie's here.

705
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:39,191
Edie!

706
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:40,235
Hi.

707
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:41,410
Thank you, Penny.

708
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:45,197
Help yourself to some
coffee and breakfast.

709
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,328
Oh, no thank you, I'm fine.

710
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:47,547
I already had plenty.

711
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:50,332
Oh, I'm sorry.

712
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:51,551
You mean Edie.

713
00:33:51,594 --> 00:33:52,465
I can get you
something right now.

714
00:33:52,508 --> 00:33:54,423
Oh, I'm okay, thank you.

715
00:33:54,467 --> 00:33:56,227
Harry was just telling
me this funny incident

716
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:58,210
that happened during
a commercial shoot.

717
00:33:58,253 --> 00:33:59,578
I've got loads of
stories, my friend.

718
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:01,778
I want to hear all of them.

719
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:02,886
Don't bother, half
of them aren't true,

720
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,259
and the rest sadly are.

721
00:34:04,303 --> 00:34:05,086
Good morning, I'm Morgan.

722
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,522
Gutt Morgan.

723
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:07,566
Edie.

724
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:10,676
Actually, I think I am
gonna get that coffee.

725
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,006
Noah.

726
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,052
I've been thinking about
it, and I have to agree.

727
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:16,706
You should feature
prominently in the campaign.

728
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,449
Good morning, everyone!

729
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:21,233
James!

730
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:22,147
Noah.

731
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,062
Nice to finally meet you, mate.

732
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:25,976
Oh, buddy, I've
heard wonderful things.

733
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,369
Oh, no, not from Harry, I hope.

734
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:29,086
If they are, you probably
shouldn't trust them.

735
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,633
Nah, I only told
him the bad ones.

736
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:33,375
Oh, no, no, they've all been
really good, I assure you.

737
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:41,035
Oh, James.

738
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,733
This is our photographer,
Edie Stevens.

739
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:45,996
Nice to meet you, Edie.

740
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:48,563
You too, James.

741
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:54,527
Now that we're all
acquainted, shall we begin?

742
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,268
Right.

743
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:59,140
So, we need a new ad
campaign, obviously.

744
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,969
So, the broad plan
is for you guys

745
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:03,275
to come up with the idea,

746
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:06,234
and work with Edie
to produce it.

747
00:35:06,278 --> 00:35:08,280
What's the time frame again?

748
00:35:08,323 --> 00:35:09,672
I'd like this out by fall.

749
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:11,109
Well, that's doable.

750
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:13,807
Do you do many commercial
productions, Edie?

751
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,850
A few.

752
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:17,506
She's being modest.

753
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,682
I mean, she's done tons.

754
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:23,164
Everyone knows if you want a
commercial shot in Charleston,

755
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,687
you want Edie.

756
00:35:24,731 --> 00:35:27,255
That is a wonderful reputation.

757
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:29,170
I mean, she does portraits,

758
00:35:29,214 --> 00:35:31,172
she even does animal portraits.

759
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:32,304
Moving on...

760
00:35:33,218 --> 00:35:34,436
You're looking for exposure

761
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,177
across multiple
platforms, I'm sure.

762
00:35:36,221 --> 00:35:38,440
Have you had any
thought as to where?

763
00:35:38,484 --> 00:35:40,225
I trust you guys to come up with

764
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:42,314
the best go-to-market strategy.

765
00:35:42,357 --> 00:35:43,445
Mhm.

766
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:44,683
And how would you
define your customers

767
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:47,275
if you had to place them, say.

768
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:48,798
Mm.

769
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:52,106
Well, our largest clients by
far are industrial farmers,

770
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,196
but we don't really see
much growth in that sector.

771
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,197
May I...

772
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:57,633
Go for it.

773
00:35:57,677 --> 00:35:59,437
We think there's a high
margin of retail potential

774
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:02,595
for urban agriculture.

775
00:36:02,638 --> 00:36:04,249
You know, people
who grow vegetables

776
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:06,468
on top of balconies
and rooftops.

777
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:08,383
Farmers and the millennials,

778
00:36:08,427 --> 00:36:10,429
they're two very
different demographics.

779
00:36:10,472 --> 00:36:11,995
Yeah.

780
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,756
We do quite a bit of
business with city parks,

781
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:17,914
suburban gardeners, and
believe it or not, cemeteries.

782
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:20,371
So you're literally
targeting everyone,

783
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:21,657
the living and the dead?

784
00:36:24,965 --> 00:36:26,358
Those are great, aren't they?

785
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:27,272
Oh, yeah.

786
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:30,797
These are very evenly lit.

787
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,190
Yeah.

788
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:33,365
Totally.

789
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,497
I don't see a
single shadow on them.

790
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:38,021
You can see
everything perfectly.

791
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:39,414
And they're in focus too.

792
00:36:39,458 --> 00:36:41,024
They sold the product.

793
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:43,113
Isn't that what art is,
defined by the outcome?

794
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:44,376
Well, I mean...

795
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:46,160
Beauty might be in the
eye of the beholder,

796
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:50,904
but surely art is
in the art itself.

797
00:36:50,947 --> 00:36:52,906
I think somebody
told me that once.

798
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,623
Do you believe that or
are you just spinning words?

799
00:36:54,647 --> 00:36:55,822
Spinning words?

800
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:56,605
Well, that's what you do, right?

801
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:58,259
As an ad man?

802
00:36:58,303 --> 00:36:59,260
I believe in what I do.

803
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:00,827
Can you say the same?

804
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:03,395
In my experience, clever
words aren't enough.

805
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:05,614
A successful campaign
needs follow through.

806
00:37:05,658 --> 00:37:08,269
You don't just launch
something and then abandon it.

807
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:09,420
Unless it always supposed to be

808
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:11,359
a limited campaign, of course.

809
00:37:11,403 --> 00:37:12,186
What is this?

810
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,449
Is this a tote bag?

811
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:16,669
No.

812
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:19,324
I know what this is,
this is a compromise.

813
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:21,108
Unlimited compromise,

814
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:22,240
I know I recognized it.

815
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:28,550
Oh, come on, I...

816
00:37:28,594 --> 00:37:29,986
I was just playing.

817
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:32,293
Edie!

818
00:37:34,991 --> 00:37:36,558
Well, that was a good start.

819
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:43,522
Edie!

820
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:45,306
Edie, Edie, where are you going?

821
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,525
I was only joking.

822
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:49,092
I haven't seen you
in 5, maybe 6 years,

823
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:50,442
and that's how you speak to me?

824
00:37:50,485 --> 00:37:52,922
I really don't see
what the problem is here.

825
00:37:52,966 --> 00:37:53,966
Are you okay?

826
00:37:54,837 --> 00:37:55,577
I'm fine.

827
00:37:55,621 --> 00:37:56,665
Noah, I'm sorry, mate.

828
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:57,971
I didn't mean to offend anyone.

829
00:37:58,014 --> 00:37:59,364
Oh, okay.

830
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:00,365
Thanks, James.

831
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:01,453
I got this.

832
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:03,541
Okay.

833
00:38:04,804 --> 00:38:05,804
What happened?

834
00:38:07,546 --> 00:38:09,374
Was it something he said?

835
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:10,418
No.

836
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:12,464
Did I do something?

837
00:38:12,507 --> 00:38:13,421
What?

838
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:14,988
Noah, no, I...

839
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:18,774
I can't do this.

840
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:22,430
Oh, right.

841
00:38:23,388 --> 00:38:25,172
Fresh with cream.

842
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:26,347
I got this for you.

843
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:30,656
Is that tomato poop?

844
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:32,048
Root poop.

845
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:33,452
That's our top
product right there.

846
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:35,704
You put it on your root
vegetables, it's a miracle.

847
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,054
Cool.

848
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:39,467
Noah, listen, I
don't think it's a-

849
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:41,014
- Look, I get it.

850
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:42,450
You do?

851
00:38:42,494 --> 00:38:44,931
You're a free spirit, you
don't want to be tied down.

852
00:38:44,974 --> 00:38:46,324
Kinda.

853
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:48,084
You're doing the same
job over and over again.

854
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:49,849
Oh, no, I meant I-

855
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:52,068
- Look, I know it's gonna
take some time to adjust,

856
00:38:52,112 --> 00:38:56,029
so why don't you go
take the rest of the day

857
00:38:56,072 --> 00:38:58,466
and we'll talk
about it at dinner.

858
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:02,077
Thanks.

859
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:03,993
That would be great.

860
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:21,881
Edie!

861
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:22,838
Babe!

862
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:24,449
How'd the meeting go?

863
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,799
It was a disaster.

864
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:29,235
Why?

865
00:39:31,673 --> 00:39:34,633
Because I've betrayed every
artistic ideal I've ever had

866
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:36,548
and I'm living a lie.

867
00:39:36,591 --> 00:39:38,550
Are they gonna pay you?

868
00:39:38,593 --> 00:39:40,334
Yeah, Mom, they're gonna pay me.

869
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,684
Yay, that's
great, congratulations.

870
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:44,556
Let's go out to
dinner to celebrate!

871
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,470
I can't.

872
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,820
I have a date.

873
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:53,521
Don't bother, I'm
not telling you.

874
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:04,662
More.

875
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:06,447
Keep going.

876
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:09,537
Yup.

877
00:40:10,582 --> 00:40:11,626
There we go.

878
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:15,587
What's the story here?

879
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:18,416
He's here.

880
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:19,460
Who?

881
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:21,593
James.

882
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:22,636
James?

883
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:25,379
English James.

884
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,685
Wait, English James?

885
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:28,469
Flaky English James.

886
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,166
Flaky, but cute English James.

887
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,865
Infuriating, arrogant,
and rude English James!

888
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:35,824
You're going to dinner with him?

889
00:40:39,175 --> 00:40:40,742
I'm going to dinner with, uh...

890
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,444
What?

891
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:47,532
Wait, how?

892
00:40:47,575 --> 00:40:48,707
Why?

893
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,535
It's not what you think.

894
00:40:50,578 --> 00:40:52,450
I think it's a work
dinner or something?

895
00:40:52,493 --> 00:40:54,539
Some sort of welcome
to the company dinner.

896
00:40:54,582 --> 00:40:56,255
When I walked out of the
meeting earlier today,

897
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:57,629
he chased after me.

898
00:40:57,672 --> 00:40:59,563
And I wanted to call it
all off, but then he just-

899
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:00,588
- Wait, wait, wait.

900
00:41:00,632 --> 00:41:01,720
One thing at a time.

901
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:03,504
You walked out on
a meeting because-

902
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:04,723
- James!

903
00:41:04,766 --> 00:41:06,638
James and his stupid
uppity ad agency

904
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:09,118
are the ones producing
Noah's campaign.

905
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:10,598
Oh!

906
00:41:10,642 --> 00:41:12,644
That's why he
looked so familiar.

907
00:41:12,687 --> 00:41:14,036
Who?

908
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,125
Well, an English guy
came in here this afternoon

909
00:41:16,169 --> 00:41:18,258
asking about holding
a launch party here,

910
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:19,564
Noah sent him.

911
00:41:19,607 --> 00:41:21,479
When you went back to
the university clinic,

912
00:41:21,522 --> 00:41:23,524
he was with me in
the waiting room.

913
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:25,787
Wait, they want to have
the launch party here?

914
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:28,573
Yeah, I guess it could work.

915
00:41:28,616 --> 00:41:30,009
Of course it will.

916
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:31,358
I can't have too much.

917
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:33,360
I'm having dinner
with Noah Pepper.

918
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:34,361
You're right.

919
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:36,363
You can't have too much.

920
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:37,538
What am I doing?

921
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:39,366
I don't know.

922
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,949
To us.

923
00:41:56,992 --> 00:41:58,603
Finally getting
to work together.

924
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,654
You know, you probably
don't know this,

925
00:42:06,698 --> 00:42:09,527
but I guess I've never
told anyone before,

926
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,834
but back in high school

927
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,316
I kinda had a crush on you.

928
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,536
Oh.

929
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:19,667
Yeah, secret's out.

930
00:42:20,886 --> 00:42:22,757
You know, but don't
worry though, please.

931
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:25,257
I almost didn't even
invite you out to dinner,

932
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:27,719
'cause I don't want
to send mixed messages

933
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:32,593
or act at all in any
way inappropriately,

934
00:42:32,637 --> 00:42:34,726
because more than
anything, Edie,

935
00:42:35,727 --> 00:42:37,598
I want to work with you.

936
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:39,339
You know, I wasn't
kidding the other day,

937
00:42:39,382 --> 00:42:40,601
I really meant it.

938
00:42:40,645 --> 00:42:43,648
I need someone who can
handle these creatives,

939
00:42:43,691 --> 00:42:45,040
tell me what's going on.

940
00:42:46,651 --> 00:42:47,782
Like today.

941
00:42:47,826 --> 00:42:49,915
It seemed like that
guy was being a jerk,

942
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:53,962
but I honestly have no
idea what was being said.

943
00:42:56,704 --> 00:42:58,576
James was...

944
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:02,971
Look, okay, yeah,
he was being a jerk.

945
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:04,625
I'll just fire them then.

946
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:06,018
Get a new agency.

947
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:07,648
I mean, you're more important
to me than they are,

948
00:43:07,672 --> 00:43:08,760
in every way.

949
00:43:08,803 --> 00:43:09,935
No, no, don't fire them.

950
00:43:12,067 --> 00:43:13,765
So...

951
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:15,157
Are you in or out?

952
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,333
Out!

953
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:18,596
In!

954
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:19,509
It was out.

955
00:43:19,553 --> 00:43:20,946
I'm pretty sure it was in.

956
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:21,729
Whatever.

957
00:43:21,773 --> 00:43:22,991
40-15, my serve.

958
00:43:28,736 --> 00:43:31,086
Noah's gold digger is
back on the campaign.

959
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:32,913
Gold digger?

960
00:43:34,786 --> 00:43:36,265
I know her type.

961
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:39,007
Morgan, you think that every
American's a gold digger.

962
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:41,619
You still haven't gotten
over Wallace Simpson.

963
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:43,272
Look, you can't blame Edie.

964
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:44,665
I upset her.

965
00:43:46,232 --> 00:43:48,713
A stiff breeze would upset
that delicate snowflake, James.

966
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:51,629
Look, creative differences
are a part of the job.

967
00:43:51,672 --> 00:43:53,195
I mean, have you
seen her pictures?

968
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,414
They're awful.

969
00:43:54,457 --> 00:43:56,895
A trained monkey
could do a better job.

970
00:43:56,938 --> 00:43:58,723
Anyway, do you fancy
a gin and tonic?

971
00:43:59,724 --> 00:44:01,639
It's about 10 in the morning.

972
00:44:01,682 --> 00:44:02,901
Not in England, darling.

973
00:44:02,944 --> 00:44:04,685
You've got a problem, you know.

974
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:05,643
I know.

975
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:06,687
I'm parched.

976
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:10,865
So where would the bar be?

977
00:44:10,909 --> 00:44:12,911
Good morning, gentlemen.

978
00:44:12,954 --> 00:44:13,955
James, this is Jess.

979
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:14,869
The gallery owner.

980
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:16,305
Oh, nice to meet you, Jess.

981
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:17,655
Nice to meet you as well.

982
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:18,719
I was actually in
London with Edie,

983
00:44:18,743 --> 00:44:20,309
so I guess we have
a mutual friend.

984
00:44:20,353 --> 00:44:23,878
Well, I hope so, but
I'm not quite sure.

985
00:44:23,922 --> 00:44:25,837
Oh, I wouldn't worry too much.

986
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,752
You know, when I
came in the other day,

987
00:44:27,795 --> 00:44:29,492
I thought you looked familiar.

988
00:44:29,536 --> 00:44:30,668
She was on Jersey Shore.

989
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:34,019
No?

990
00:44:34,062 --> 00:44:35,062
Survivor.

991
00:44:36,238 --> 00:44:37,805
Am I close?

992
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:38,632
Morning.

993
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,546
Okay.

994
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:41,809
When we were sent from London

995
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:45,247
to open our North
American agency branch,

996
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:48,729
we did it with Pepper
Poop on our minds.

997
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:50,383
How are the acoustics?

998
00:44:50,426 --> 00:44:51,689
Yeah, they're fine, Morgan.

999
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:54,213
You're not gonna say
that though, are you?

1000
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:56,868
Well, I don't know
what I'm going to say.

1001
00:44:56,911 --> 00:44:58,043
Do we need a mic?

1002
00:44:58,086 --> 00:44:59,305
I think we need a mic.

1003
00:45:00,045 --> 00:45:01,829
Harry, Harry?

1004
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:02,830
Are you writing this down?

1005
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:03,874
Writing what down?

1006
00:45:05,398 --> 00:45:06,442
I agree with Morgan.

1007
00:45:06,486 --> 00:45:07,879
With a lot of people here,

1008
00:45:07,922 --> 00:45:09,857
a microphone will really
help cut across the noise.

1009
00:45:09,881 --> 00:45:11,709
Then we'll get a mic.

1010
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:12,884
James.

1011
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:14,668
Seeing as Edie missed
much of Friday,

1012
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,323
perhaps you could
bring her up to speed.

1013
00:45:17,366 --> 00:45:18,585
Of course, Morgan.

1014
00:45:23,459 --> 00:45:24,459
All right.

1015
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:26,332
Let's see.

1016
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:30,815
After you left, well,
I came to your dorm,

1017
00:45:30,858 --> 00:45:34,514
I went to Heathrow, and
then the proceeding 6 years

1018
00:45:34,557 --> 00:45:36,037
were pretty dull and dreary.

1019
00:45:36,081 --> 00:45:38,474
But, you know, that's
England for you.

1020
00:45:38,518 --> 00:45:40,563
After the meeting, James.

1021
00:45:40,607 --> 00:45:42,870
Oh, not much really.

1022
00:45:42,914 --> 00:45:46,918
We decided we'd do
billboards, print, TV, radio.

1023
00:45:46,961 --> 00:45:49,790
In terms of the creative vision,

1024
00:45:49,834 --> 00:45:52,358
we're gonna emphasize
what fertilizer does

1025
00:45:52,401 --> 00:45:55,665
rather than what it is,
for obvious reasons.

1026
00:45:55,709 --> 00:45:56,709
And...

1027
00:45:57,885 --> 00:45:59,278
Yeah.

1028
00:45:59,321 --> 00:46:02,281
Noah wants to be featured
in the campaign personally.

1029
00:46:03,108 --> 00:46:04,108
Again?

1030
00:46:05,937 --> 00:46:07,286
You saw that?

1031
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:11,769
It was a different time,
and it worked back then.

1032
00:46:12,944 --> 00:46:14,206
Right, yeah.

1033
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:17,818
Although I suppose the
outcome made it art.

1034
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,386
What do you mean?

1035
00:46:20,429 --> 00:46:21,822
Just, you know...

1036
00:46:21,866 --> 00:46:24,825
Beauty's in the eye
of the beholder.

1037
00:46:24,869 --> 00:46:25,869
Seriously?

1038
00:46:27,741 --> 00:46:29,308
Oh, come on, Edie!

1039
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,746
We're both compromised
artists now.

1040
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,880
The only difference is, I
don't see any shame in that.

1041
00:46:35,923 --> 00:46:38,883
Whereas you clearly haven't
come to terms with it.

1042
00:46:38,926 --> 00:46:40,841
Do you think
that's why I'm angry?

1043
00:46:40,885 --> 00:46:41,842
Isn't it?

1044
00:46:41,886 --> 00:46:43,365
No!

1045
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:45,715
Well, yes, but I'm mostly
angry that you never showed up.

1046
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,152
Well, excuse me?

1047
00:46:47,195 --> 00:46:48,631
I waited for you.

1048
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:50,720
And then when you
didn't show up,

1049
00:46:50,764 --> 00:46:52,244
I even went to your office.

1050
00:46:52,287 --> 00:46:54,289
I gave Morgan my number.

1051
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:55,856
I want the spotlight on me.

1052
00:46:59,033 --> 00:47:00,513
I think I'm gonna head out.

1053
00:47:00,556 --> 00:47:03,472
I have enough to get
started on some test shoots.

1054
00:47:03,516 --> 00:47:04,865
It's simple.

1055
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:07,085
Sell the function, not
the product, feature you.

1056
00:47:07,128 --> 00:47:08,347
I have some ideas.

1057
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:09,846
It'll be easier to
show you than tell you.

1058
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,959
You won't stick around today?

1059
00:47:12,003 --> 00:47:14,875
No, I think this is a much
more productive use of my time.

1060
00:47:27,975 --> 00:47:29,847
How can they call it football?

1061
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,588
Only one man on the field
ever touches it with his foot.

1062
00:47:33,633 --> 00:47:35,113
Harry.

1063
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:37,332
Do you remember
about 6 years ago

1064
00:47:37,376 --> 00:47:40,379
when I asked you to meet
a girl in a park for me?

1065
00:47:40,422 --> 00:47:41,380
Of course I do.

1066
00:47:41,423 --> 00:47:43,121
You still owe me
dinner for that.

1067
00:47:43,164 --> 00:47:46,211
Did you actually
speak to the girl?

1068
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:47,995
Yes.

1069
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:48,866
Ide.

1070
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:50,041
Nice girl.

1071
00:47:50,084 --> 00:47:51,956
We're still friends online.

1072
00:47:51,999 --> 00:47:53,392
Show me?

1073
00:47:53,435 --> 00:47:55,611
I always wondered what
happened between you two.

1074
00:47:55,655 --> 00:47:56,980
I always figured
it ended naturally

1075
00:47:57,004 --> 00:47:58,310
when she moved back to Japan-

1076
00:47:58,353 --> 00:47:59,789
- Oh, no.

1077
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:01,704
Have you seen her
animated cat videos?

1078
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:02,967
Aren't those incredible?

1079
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:04,751
Harry, what have you done?

1080
00:48:04,794 --> 00:48:05,795
What?

1081
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:06,709
Edie.

1082
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:08,973
Harry, I said Edie, not Ide.

1083
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,126
You said a foreign
girl with a camera

1084
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:13,412
who answered to Edie.

1085
00:48:13,455 --> 00:48:14,693
This was the only
one in the park.

1086
00:48:14,717 --> 00:48:15,717
Edie!

1087
00:48:16,806 --> 00:48:17,806
Edie?

1088
00:48:19,113 --> 00:48:20,288
Oh, God, it's Edie.

1089
00:48:20,332 --> 00:48:21,570
Wait, that's where
I've seen Jess before.

1090
00:48:21,594 --> 00:48:23,378
She was at the clinic.

1091
00:48:23,422 --> 00:48:24,292
Where are you going?

1092
00:48:24,336 --> 00:48:25,598
To beg forgiveness!

1093
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:27,643
But you have chips
coming, do you...

1094
00:48:27,687 --> 00:48:29,167
Do you want your chips?

1095
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,995
You still owe me for dinner!

1096
00:48:48,447 --> 00:48:50,579
Noah, how did you get
it under your collar?

1097
00:48:50,623 --> 00:48:53,060
I don't know, it just
kind of dripped down.

1098
00:48:53,104 --> 00:48:54,018
It looks good to me.

1099
00:48:54,061 --> 00:48:56,716
Come on, we've got work to do.

1100
00:49:14,864 --> 00:49:16,431
Thank you.

1101
00:49:26,137 --> 00:49:27,312
Famous photographers?

1102
00:49:29,575 --> 00:49:30,663
They exist.

1103
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:33,971
How did you find me?

1104
00:49:34,014 --> 00:49:35,014
Harry told me.

1105
00:49:36,669 --> 00:49:38,018
Did you really go to Heathrow?

1106
00:49:38,062 --> 00:49:39,062
Yeah, I did.

1107
00:49:40,325 --> 00:49:41,630
I didn't get very far.

1108
00:49:41,674 --> 00:49:43,217
Apparently they frown
upon young lovers

1109
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:45,025
trying to storm security.

1110
00:49:47,506 --> 00:49:48,768
Mio Ide, huh?

1111
00:49:50,074 --> 00:49:51,553
I see he's told
you a few things.

1112
00:49:51,597 --> 00:49:53,816
Yeah, he's a nice guy.

1113
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,600
Unlike me?

1114
00:49:54,643 --> 00:49:55,427
Pretty much.

1115
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:56,470
Okay.

1116
00:49:59,605 --> 00:50:01,433
I am sorry, Edie.

1117
00:50:02,738 --> 00:50:04,914
For the way that I spoke
to you in that meeting.

1118
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:06,133
You should be.

1119
00:50:06,177 --> 00:50:07,961
But I'm not sorry
for what I said.

1120
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,354
You're insufferable.

1121
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:11,008
And I'll admit that.

1122
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:13,793
If you admit that you're
above shooting tote bags.

1123
00:50:14,707 --> 00:50:15,969
I needed the money.

1124
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,710
Since when did you
care about money?

1125
00:50:17,753 --> 00:50:18,972
Yes.

1126
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,452
I compromised.

1127
00:50:20,495 --> 00:50:22,976
I betrayed a younger, more
pure version of myself

1128
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,500
because I needed the
money to help someone.

1129
00:50:25,544 --> 00:50:27,111
Are you happy now?

1130
00:50:27,154 --> 00:50:29,722
Well, obviously not, now
you've put it like that.

1131
00:50:29,765 --> 00:50:30,765
But...

1132
00:50:32,116 --> 00:50:34,292
It was a joke, Edie.

1133
00:50:35,771 --> 00:50:39,036
One of life's little ironies.

1134
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:41,081
But you took it to
this whole other level,

1135
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:43,127
which I understand
now that I know about

1136
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,129
Harry and that tourist.

1137
00:50:45,172 --> 00:50:47,218
But, no...

1138
00:50:48,697 --> 00:50:50,569
No, I am not doing this.

1139
00:50:50,612 --> 00:50:51,526
Doing what?

1140
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:52,570
Arguing with you.

1141
00:50:53,963 --> 00:50:56,749
I bought you that
book to say sorry.

1142
00:50:58,185 --> 00:50:59,185
Why didn't you say it?

1143
00:51:00,231 --> 00:51:03,060
'Cause, you had company,

1144
00:51:03,103 --> 00:51:04,713
and I didn't want to intrude.

1145
00:51:05,845 --> 00:51:07,325
Well, I'm here now.

1146
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:08,587
And I'm saying sorry.

1147
00:51:10,415 --> 00:51:12,678
For the way that I spoke to you.

1148
00:51:12,721 --> 00:51:13,853
But not for what you said.

1149
00:51:13,896 --> 00:51:14,896
No.

1150
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:19,815
No, because what I saw in
there was not inspiring, Edie.

1151
00:51:21,165 --> 00:51:22,601
And I don't mind
saying that to you

1152
00:51:22,644 --> 00:51:24,690
because I also know
that it's not you.

1153
00:51:24,733 --> 00:51:25,778
You don't know me.

1154
00:51:27,432 --> 00:51:28,476
I don't know you?

1155
00:51:41,794 --> 00:51:42,795
This is you.

1156
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:46,146
You still have this?

1157
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:48,017
Of course.

1158
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:49,845
And you carry it with you?

1159
00:51:49,889 --> 00:51:50,889
Mhm.

1160
00:51:52,457 --> 00:51:54,241
That's a little weird.

1161
00:51:54,285 --> 00:51:55,677
Newsflash!

1162
00:51:55,721 --> 00:51:58,158
I am a little weird.

1163
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:02,206
And I didn't keep it because
I never moved on from

1164
00:52:02,249 --> 00:52:03,642
whatever it was that we had,

1165
00:52:03,685 --> 00:52:08,342
I kept it because I was
wrong, and you were right.

1166
00:52:10,344 --> 00:52:13,260
It's not just a picture
of a building corner

1167
00:52:13,304 --> 00:52:16,568
or a drill bit, or fertilizer.

1168
00:52:18,657 --> 00:52:21,094
It's a story, that
was our story.

1169
00:52:23,618 --> 00:52:26,752
And tote bags do
not tell stories.

1170
00:52:26,795 --> 00:52:28,014
Yes.

1171
00:52:28,057 --> 00:52:29,668
Enough about the
tote bags, I get it.

1172
00:52:29,711 --> 00:52:30,711
But do you?

1173
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:34,760
Because I want to
work with this Edie.

1174
00:52:34,803 --> 00:52:38,416
I am dying to work
with this Edie.

1175
00:52:38,459 --> 00:52:41,723
You know, our drill bit
campaign won us loads of awards.

1176
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:44,204
Practically put the
agency on the map.

1177
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:47,164
And you know what
the centerpiece was?

1178
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:48,426
What?

1179
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:52,212
A macro photographer
of a drill bit,

1180
00:52:52,256 --> 00:52:57,217
low angle, with the spiral
thingies pointing up.

1181
00:52:58,262 --> 00:52:59,567
They're called threads.

1182
00:52:59,611 --> 00:53:01,265
That was you, Edie.

1183
00:53:03,528 --> 00:53:05,530
You put us on the map, in a way.

1184
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:11,188
Also, it was me, because
my copy was amazing.

1185
00:54:14,468 --> 00:54:15,948
Hey.

1186
00:54:15,991 --> 00:54:17,254
I just thought I'd bring...

1187
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:18,646
Oh, wow.

1188
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:20,300
What is that smell?

1189
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:22,041
Chicken poop or something.

1190
00:54:22,084 --> 00:54:23,260
Fertilizer of some sort.

1191
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:24,913
Why is that smell?

1192
00:54:24,957 --> 00:54:25,827
You get used to it.

1193
00:54:25,871 --> 00:54:27,220
Hey, come check these out.

1194
00:54:28,526 --> 00:54:29,788
You'll be fine, come on.

1195
00:54:30,615 --> 00:54:34,271
Oh, Edie, these look great.

1196
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:35,663
This is fertilizer?

1197
00:54:35,707 --> 00:54:37,274
Yeah.

1198
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:38,187
Wow, I haven't seen you

1199
00:54:38,231 --> 00:54:40,146
do anything like this in years.

1200
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:41,189
Hey!

1201
00:54:42,409 --> 00:54:45,282
Dating Noah is clearly
working out for you.

1202
00:54:45,325 --> 00:54:46,370
We're not dating.

1203
00:54:47,632 --> 00:54:48,957
How many times have
you been out to dinner?

1204
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:50,417
Twice.

1205
00:54:50,461 --> 00:54:51,829
But we were doing a
work thing last night-

1206
00:54:51,853 --> 00:54:54,160
- And when are you going
out to dinner again?

1207
00:54:55,466 --> 00:54:56,466
Tomorrow.

1208
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:58,556
Well, if it looks like poop-

1209
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:00,253
- And smells like
poop, yeah, I get it.

1210
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,820
But this isn't Noah.

1211
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:05,867
I had a good conversation
with James yesterday.

1212
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,260
Oh.

1213
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,568
Yeah.

1214
00:55:10,611 --> 00:55:13,222
Oh, yes!

1215
00:55:13,266 --> 00:55:14,485
Oh, these are brilliant.

1216
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:16,399
I love this one!

1217
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:18,140
That's amazing.

1218
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:18,924
Was that in the studio?

1219
00:55:18,967 --> 00:55:20,404
Yeah.

1220
00:55:20,447 --> 00:55:21,448
Good morning, Penny.

1221
00:55:21,492 --> 00:55:22,362
Good morning, Noah.

1222
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:23,494
How was your night?

1223
00:55:23,537 --> 00:55:24,669
Good.

1224
00:55:24,712 --> 00:55:26,124
The dog wet the bed
again, but it's okay.

1225
00:55:26,148 --> 00:55:27,585
Just had...

1226
00:55:27,628 --> 00:55:28,934
Yeah, it was.

1227
00:55:28,977 --> 00:55:30,477
I feel like we should
maybe figure out

1228
00:55:30,501 --> 00:55:32,067
a way to incorporate Noah.

1229
00:55:32,111 --> 00:55:33,373
Maybe like behind over here.

1230
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:35,375
Yeah, behind everything maybe.

1231
00:55:36,245 --> 00:55:37,856
Just somewhere small.

1232
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,075
Hidden in the dirt.

1233
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:42,077
Just like, way off
in the distance.

1234
00:55:42,121 --> 00:55:43,383
Basically not in it.

1235
00:55:43,427 --> 00:55:45,037
That would be more ideal for me.

1236
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:53,611
Oh, no, these are great.

1237
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:54,916
These are great.

1238
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,285
Well, we can get some
more of these then?

1239
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:57,179
Yeah.

1240
00:55:57,223 --> 00:55:58,572
I have a couple more extra.

1241
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:03,403
Okay, before our lucky talk

1242
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:06,188
about fertile fields
and productive farming,

1243
00:56:06,232 --> 00:56:07,818
we have to at least
acknowledge the fact

1244
00:56:07,842 --> 00:56:10,497
that what we're
selling is feces.

1245
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:11,455
So, we double down.

1246
00:56:11,498 --> 00:56:12,760
We make a joke out of it.

1247
00:56:12,804 --> 00:56:14,414
But not out of the campaign.

1248
00:56:14,458 --> 00:56:15,676
No, we can't undermine it.

1249
00:56:16,938 --> 00:56:18,462
And Noah needs to be in it.

1250
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,376
Right.

1251
00:56:21,116 --> 00:56:23,249
Okay, let's get him in it.

1252
00:56:23,292 --> 00:56:25,425
I think he's gonna like this.

1253
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:26,513
Noah?

1254
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,385
Sorry.

1255
00:56:30,038 --> 00:56:31,997
I have no idea how late it is.

1256
00:56:33,564 --> 00:56:35,522
Well, we've been on a roll.

1257
00:56:35,566 --> 00:56:36,566
Getting it done.

1258
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:41,485
That's it.

1259
00:56:41,528 --> 00:56:42,311
"Getting it done."

1260
00:56:42,355 --> 00:56:43,355
That's the tagline.

1261
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,577
I love it.

1262
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:47,404
Yes!

1263
00:56:47,447 --> 00:56:49,014
Come on, put it there.

1264
00:56:49,057 --> 00:56:50,057
Mm.

1265
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,496
All right.

1266
00:56:52,539 --> 00:56:53,758
Should we call it a day there?

1267
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:54,801
Heck no.

1268
00:56:55,847 --> 00:56:58,110
Do you want to do
some test shoots?

1269
00:56:58,153 --> 00:57:00,025
I mean, I'm up
for it if you are.

1270
00:57:00,068 --> 00:57:00,765
Let's go.

1271
00:57:00,808 --> 00:57:01,808
Let's go!

1272
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:03,942
To the studio, baby.

1273
00:57:16,868 --> 00:57:18,652
Can I have a couple
more minutes, please?

1274
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:32,884
"Things in life should be
simple rather than complex."

1275
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:35,408
I've been saying
this for a long time.

1276
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,323
I don't know what else
to say at this point.

1277
00:57:38,629 --> 00:57:39,693
I don't think any of
them make any sense.

1278
00:57:39,717 --> 00:57:40,997
Also, how do you use chopsticks?

1279
00:57:41,849 --> 00:57:43,285
Are you supposed to have two?

1280
00:57:43,329 --> 00:57:44,852
I only have one.

1281
00:57:44,896 --> 00:57:45,636
Here, you want my other one?

1282
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:46,679
Not really.

1283
00:57:49,204 --> 00:57:50,510
Excuse me.

1284
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:53,339
Can I have another
double on the rocks?

1285
00:57:53,382 --> 00:57:55,515
Would you like any food, sir?

1286
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:56,559
No, just whisky.

1287
00:57:57,561 --> 00:57:59,432
And the check, please.

1288
00:58:10,356 --> 00:58:11,662
Off the plane, you'll be greeted

1289
00:58:11,705 --> 00:58:13,054
by a tropical breeze.

1290
00:58:13,098 --> 00:58:15,796
Imagine your toes in the sand.

1291
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:16,840
Oh.

1292
00:58:18,538 --> 00:58:19,670
Hey, Noah.

1293
00:58:19,713 --> 00:58:20,540
This.

1294
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:22,107
Do you like the lean?

1295
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:23,430
Do I look like the face of poop?

1296
00:58:24,675 --> 00:58:25,806
I don't think that's gonna-

1297
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:27,001
- That's what I'm
really going for here.

1298
00:58:27,025 --> 00:58:27,895
That's not gonna work for Noah.

1299
00:58:27,939 --> 00:58:29,549
I'm not opening the bag.

1300
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:30,613
Come on, we have to show him
what we're thinking, right?

1301
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:32,552
I'm not showering
myself in poop.

1302
00:58:34,728 --> 00:58:36,600
I don't even want to
know what's going on.

1303
00:58:36,643 --> 00:58:37,949
Harry, Jess.

1304
00:58:37,992 --> 00:58:38,906
What are you two-

1305
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:40,560
- There's no time for that!

1306
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:43,737
Edie, your mom and I guess
now Noah is looking for you.

1307
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:44,781
What...

1308
00:58:46,087 --> 00:58:47,349
Oh, no, I forgot dinner.

1309
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:48,699
What?

1310
00:58:48,742 --> 00:58:49,742
I need my phone.

1311
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:52,050
Can someone call my phone?

1312
00:58:52,093 --> 00:58:53,093
On it.

1313
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,108
You need to hide him, now.

1314
00:59:07,152 --> 00:59:08,719
Oh, no, we were just working.

1315
00:59:08,762 --> 00:59:11,939
Yeah, Harry, mate, we
have an awesome campaign.

1316
00:59:11,983 --> 00:59:13,245
Nice one.

1317
00:59:13,288 --> 00:59:14,638
Think about what
this looks like!

1318
00:59:14,681 --> 00:59:16,553
Your mom is worried about you,

1319
00:59:16,596 --> 00:59:18,424
she's looking for you.

1320
00:59:18,467 --> 00:59:20,644
She and Noah are
going to come here.

1321
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:22,665
Shoot, you're right, yeah.

1322
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:23,603
You gotta go.

1323
00:59:23,647 --> 00:59:24,386
What?

1324
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:25,649
No, this is absurd.

1325
00:59:25,692 --> 00:59:27,365
I'll just explain to
Noah we were working,

1326
00:59:27,389 --> 00:59:28,695
show him the shots.

1327
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:30,088
You had a date with him?

1328
00:59:30,131 --> 00:59:31,611
No, it's...

1329
00:59:31,655 --> 00:59:33,482
Can we just not complicate
things right now?

1330
00:59:33,526 --> 00:59:34,745
Too late.

1331
00:59:34,788 --> 00:59:37,574
I see Noah and an
angry looking woman

1332
00:59:37,617 --> 00:59:38,812
that parked across the across.

1333
00:59:38,836 --> 00:59:39,706
That's Susan.

1334
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:40,577
Who's Susan?

1335
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,361
My mom.

1336
00:59:42,404 --> 00:59:43,318
Yeah, I'm gonna hide.

1337
00:59:43,362 --> 00:59:44,406
Yeah, go to the bathroom.

1338
00:59:47,758 --> 00:59:48,802
Shh.

1339
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:51,936
Why are you in here?

1340
00:59:51,979 --> 00:59:54,329
Because the mom looks
really angry, I got scared.

1341
00:59:54,373 --> 00:59:55,243
Edie?

1342
00:59:55,287 --> 00:59:56,287
Edie?

1343
00:59:57,158 --> 00:59:59,247
Why aren't you
answering your phone?

1344
00:59:59,291 --> 01:00:00,466
Mom, I'm not a child,

1345
01:00:00,509 --> 01:00:01,791
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

1346
01:00:01,815 --> 01:00:03,469
Uh, maybe not to me,

1347
01:00:03,512 --> 01:00:05,645
but you definitely have to
explain yourself to Noah.

1348
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:07,299
He called and you
missed your date?

1349
01:00:07,342 --> 01:00:08,735
It was just dinner.

1350
01:00:08,779 --> 01:00:11,172
Oh, no, no, don't
sell yourself short.

1351
01:00:11,216 --> 01:00:12,434
You're wonderful.

1352
01:00:12,478 --> 01:00:13,760
Do you think I don't
have better things to do

1353
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:15,220
than to drive all over town?

1354
01:00:15,263 --> 01:00:17,788
Mom, if you would just
stop talking for two seconds,

1355
01:00:17,831 --> 01:00:19,616
I could explain.

1356
01:00:19,659 --> 01:00:20,747
I've been-

1357
01:00:20,791 --> 01:00:21,792
- Yeah?

1358
01:00:21,835 --> 01:00:22,706
I've been, uh-

1359
01:00:22,749 --> 01:00:25,447
- Here, with me.

1360
01:00:25,491 --> 01:00:28,015
Yeah, Edie and I
had dinner together,

1361
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:30,714
and she just totally
forgot about your date.

1362
01:00:30,757 --> 01:00:32,585
It's my fault.

1363
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,717
I'm so sorry, Noah.

1364
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,240
It's okay.

1365
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:41,812
Is that the Evergreen
Pro-Poop-Lactic?

1366
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,335
What?

1367
01:00:43,378 --> 01:00:44,684
That fertilizer.

1368
01:00:44,728 --> 01:00:47,731
It's a proprietary
disease resilient blend.

1369
01:00:47,774 --> 01:00:49,210
Oh, that's wonderful.

1370
01:00:49,254 --> 01:00:50,559
It's Pepper Poop.

1371
01:00:50,603 --> 01:00:53,475
I was working earlier,
and I got caught up,

1372
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:54,738
I completely forgot.

1373
01:00:54,781 --> 01:00:55,782
Telephone?

1374
01:00:55,826 --> 01:00:56,914
You coulda called.

1375
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:58,543
- It's fine, Mrs.
- Stevens, it's really-

1376
01:00:58,567 --> 01:00:59,264
- Okay.

1377
01:00:59,307 --> 01:01:00,831
It's fine.

1378
01:01:00,874 --> 01:01:02,994
I just didn't know where
you were, and I got worried.

1379
01:01:03,398 --> 01:01:05,662
Well, I mean if
you're okay, Noah,

1380
01:01:05,705 --> 01:01:07,185
I guess we could go.

1381
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:08,534
And I'll see you at home.

1382
01:01:08,577 --> 01:01:10,492
But I just gotta go to
the bathroom real quick.

1383
01:01:10,536 --> 01:01:12,016
- No!
- No!

1384
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:12,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1385
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:15,193
What's going on here, girls?

1386
01:01:15,236 --> 01:01:17,282
Just go at home.

1387
01:01:17,325 --> 01:01:19,676
Uh, Edie, I have to
go to the bathroom now.

1388
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,939
Not later.

1389
01:01:21,982 --> 01:01:23,897
There is a bar down
the block that is open.

1390
01:01:26,421 --> 01:01:28,182
Okay, you guys are being
really weird right now.

1391
01:01:28,206 --> 01:01:29,860
What is going on, okay?

1392
01:01:29,903 --> 01:01:32,993
I have to go to the
bathroom, excuse me-

1393
01:01:33,037 --> 01:01:34,037
- Nope.

1394
01:01:34,865 --> 01:01:36,475
There's someone in there.

1395
01:01:36,518 --> 01:01:38,695
My date.

1396
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:40,174
Okay.

1397
01:01:40,218 --> 01:01:42,002
So you have a
boyfriend now, Jess?

1398
01:01:42,046 --> 01:01:43,874
No, not my boyfriend.

1399
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:46,050
This is our first date.

1400
01:01:46,093 --> 01:01:49,401
You brought your new
date to dinner with Edie?

1401
01:01:49,444 --> 01:01:50,750
We're having it after dinner,

1402
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:52,709
he just needed to
use the bathroom.

1403
01:01:54,928 --> 01:01:57,104
Well, do you like him, dear?

1404
01:01:57,148 --> 01:01:58,192
- Yeah.
- Your date?

1405
01:01:58,236 --> 01:01:59,063
Yeah.

1406
01:01:59,106 --> 01:02:00,106
He's...

1407
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,242
Accidentally offensive
and persistent,

1408
01:02:04,285 --> 01:02:09,290
but there's something
really adorable about him.

1409
01:02:10,465 --> 01:02:10,814
Oh, that's wonderful, hun.

1410
01:02:10,857 --> 01:02:11,684
Hey.

1411
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:12,728
Can you focus?

1412
01:02:14,861 --> 01:02:17,690
He has been in there
for quite a while though.

1413
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,170
You sure he's okay?

1414
01:02:19,213 --> 01:02:21,607
Yeah, he's been in
there for a minute.

1415
01:02:22,826 --> 01:02:24,088
Oh, he's not feeling well.

1416
01:02:25,654 --> 01:02:27,395
Okay.

1417
01:02:31,095 --> 01:02:32,836
Okay.
What was that?

1418
01:02:33,706 --> 01:02:34,706
Huh.

1419
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:40,844
Good evening, everyone.

1420
01:02:40,887 --> 01:02:42,759
How are you feeling?

1421
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:43,803
Much better, thank you.

1422
01:02:44,935 --> 01:02:45,892
Great, in fact.

1423
01:02:45,936 --> 01:02:48,155
Jess, are you
ready for our date?

1424
01:02:49,113 --> 01:02:50,157
Yup, yup.

1425
01:02:50,201 --> 01:02:50,941
Excellent.

1426
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:51,984
- Okay.
- Okay.

1427
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:57,643
Um, okay.

1428
01:02:57,686 --> 01:02:59,732
Can I use the bathroom now?

1429
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:00,776
Okay.

1430
01:03:29,936 --> 01:03:30,936
Noah?

1431
01:03:33,897 --> 01:03:34,897
Noah!

1432
01:03:44,646 --> 01:03:47,388
Edie, there's no toilet paper!

1433
01:03:47,432 --> 01:03:48,432
Okay.

1434
01:03:57,442 --> 01:03:58,835
Sweetie, what's going on?

1435
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,576
Is it that Englishman?

1436
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:02,969
Noah told me about him.

1437
01:04:03,013 --> 01:04:04,710
I really worry about you.

1438
01:04:04,753 --> 01:04:06,016
I hate to see you get hurt,

1439
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:06,930
and I don't think
it's a good thing

1440
01:04:06,973 --> 01:04:08,757
to be chasing after this guy.

1441
01:04:08,801 --> 01:04:10,411
I mean, he's the
one who left you.

1442
01:04:10,455 --> 01:04:12,326
I'm afraid he's
gonna do that again.

1443
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:15,112
You really need somebody
stable, dependable,

1444
01:04:15,155 --> 01:04:16,548
and Noah's a good man,

1445
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:19,159
and he would be
financially stable as well.

1446
01:04:19,203 --> 01:04:20,552
I just really worry.

1447
01:04:20,595 --> 01:04:22,336
And, you know,
when your dad left,

1448
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:25,296
I promised I'd never let
something like that happen to you.

1449
01:04:26,775 --> 01:04:28,734
I'm afraid this guy's
gonna break your heart,

1450
01:04:28,777 --> 01:04:31,432
and you're gonna lose your
opportunity to be with Noah.

1451
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:36,307
You know I love you, and I
just want the best for you.

1452
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:38,222
I'm really glad
we had this chat.

1453
01:04:38,265 --> 01:04:40,528
And thank you for
listening for once.

1454
01:04:40,572 --> 01:04:43,792
Well, now I gotta go
to my kickboxing class.

1455
01:04:43,836 --> 01:04:45,272
See you later!

1456
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,848
We need to focus
on the campaign.

1457
01:04:57,154 --> 01:04:59,417
What are we selling?

1458
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:00,460
Poop.

1459
01:05:01,288 --> 01:05:02,594
No.

1460
01:05:02,637 --> 01:05:05,292
No, we're not selling
that, we're selling...

1461
01:05:06,859 --> 01:05:08,513
Cultivation.

1462
01:05:08,556 --> 01:05:09,556
Growth.

1463
01:05:10,471 --> 01:05:12,430
Life itself!

1464
01:05:18,175 --> 01:05:20,960
I'll go for coffee,
while we wait for them.

1465
01:05:22,135 --> 01:05:23,135
I'll help you.

1466
01:05:24,268 --> 01:05:25,008
Where are they?

1467
01:05:25,051 --> 01:05:26,357
They're not together.

1468
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:27,638
I know that much, I
saw James this morning

1469
01:05:27,662 --> 01:05:29,795
and he was definitely
on his own.

1470
01:05:32,493 --> 01:05:34,365
A raspberry frappuccino.

1471
01:05:34,408 --> 01:05:35,408
You got it.

1472
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:37,803
Morgan?

1473
01:05:37,846 --> 01:05:39,370
Black.

1474
01:05:44,592 --> 01:05:45,985
Good luck.

1475
01:05:51,077 --> 01:05:52,296
Oh.

1476
01:05:52,339 --> 01:05:53,340
Nice of you to join us.

1477
01:05:53,384 --> 01:05:55,212
How was your lie in?

1478
01:05:55,255 --> 01:05:56,624
I wasn't aware we had
a meeting scheduled.

1479
01:05:56,648 --> 01:05:58,389
Oh, you must've forgotten.

1480
01:05:58,432 --> 01:06:01,653
No, Morgan, you must've
forgotten to actually tell me.

1481
01:06:01,696 --> 01:06:03,655
Don't you dare
speak to me like that!

1482
01:06:03,698 --> 01:06:05,787
Especially in front of a client.

1483
01:06:05,831 --> 01:06:07,137
I expect an apology.

1484
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,486
For what?

1485
01:06:08,529 --> 01:06:10,923
For insubordination, tardiness,

1486
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,012
and inappropriate relations
with a team member!

1487
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:16,015
Oh, Harry and I are
just good friends.

1488
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:17,451
With the American girl.

1489
01:06:17,495 --> 01:06:20,063
Edie and I were working.

1490
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:23,066
And the campaign's good.

1491
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:24,371
It's really, really good.

1492
01:06:27,418 --> 01:06:29,178
If you can grow up for one
minute, you'll see that.

1493
01:06:29,202 --> 01:06:31,030
She's his girlfriend, James.

1494
01:06:31,074 --> 01:06:31,813
I didn't know that!

1495
01:06:31,857 --> 01:06:33,032
Look-

1496
01:06:33,076 --> 01:06:34,140
- Haven't you done
enough damage?

1497
01:06:34,164 --> 01:06:37,167
Yeah, all right, Morgan, just...

1498
01:06:38,037 --> 01:06:39,169
Look, Noah.

1499
01:06:44,609 --> 01:06:45,609
Noah.

1500
01:06:46,437 --> 01:06:47,742
I understand you're upset

1501
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:49,744
that Edie missed
your date last night,

1502
01:06:51,181 --> 01:06:54,967
but we have your campaign,
and it's beautiful.

1503
01:06:58,101 --> 01:06:59,276
Isn't that what you wanted?

1504
01:07:00,886 --> 01:07:02,279
Can you promise
me you have nothing

1505
01:07:02,322 --> 01:07:05,108
but professional
interest in Edie?

1506
01:07:06,283 --> 01:07:07,284
Excuse me?

1507
01:07:10,809 --> 01:07:13,812
Can you promise
me you have nothing

1508
01:07:13,855 --> 01:07:16,771
but professional
interests in Edie?

1509
01:07:29,132 --> 01:07:30,133
The campaign.

1510
01:07:30,176 --> 01:07:31,482
Noah, it's everything.

1511
01:07:35,138 --> 01:07:36,182
I...

1512
01:07:37,618 --> 01:07:41,318
Need to go to the factory
and check on production.

1513
01:07:48,107 --> 01:07:49,152
Noah!

1514
01:07:49,195 --> 01:07:50,370
Noah!

1515
01:07:50,414 --> 01:07:51,676
Noah.

1516
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:53,112
Noah.

1517
01:07:53,156 --> 01:07:54,916
Do you want us to continue
working in your absence?

1518
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:58,161
I can assure you, we are the
right fit for your company.

1519
01:07:58,204 --> 01:07:59,205
Look, please.

1520
01:07:59,249 --> 01:08:00,685
Just don't do
anything rash, okay?

1521
01:08:00,728 --> 01:08:03,862
We will do whatever is
necessary to keep your business.

1522
01:08:04,863 --> 01:08:06,082
Let's just talk about it

1523
01:08:06,125 --> 01:08:07,725
when you're back from
the factory, okay?

1524
01:08:08,736 --> 01:08:09,736
Noah?

1525
01:08:11,304 --> 01:08:12,914
Noah, I know you can hear me.

1526
01:08:33,152 --> 01:08:35,198
Noah!

1527
01:08:41,073 --> 01:08:42,073
Richard, darling!

1528
01:08:43,815 --> 01:08:45,053
I don't understand
why they have to be

1529
01:08:45,077 --> 01:08:46,513
so juvenile about this.

1530
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:49,776
Are they wrong?

1531
01:08:50,648 --> 01:08:51,648
What?

1532
01:08:52,998 --> 01:08:55,131
You hesitated when Noah
asked you that question.

1533
01:08:55,174 --> 01:08:57,133
Is your interest in me
purely professional?

1534
01:09:02,225 --> 01:09:03,225
Um...

1535
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:06,359
Yes, yeah.

1536
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:09,840
You're lying.

1537
01:09:11,277 --> 01:09:12,277
Edie...

1538
01:09:12,931 --> 01:09:14,889
You are dating Noah.

1539
01:09:14,933 --> 01:09:16,326
No, I'm not.

1540
01:09:16,369 --> 01:09:18,217
Well, that's not what
everyone else seems to think.

1541
01:09:18,241 --> 01:09:20,068
That's not what
Noah seems to think.

1542
01:09:20,112 --> 01:09:21,568
I mean, you have
literally been going

1543
01:09:21,592 --> 01:09:23,289
on dates with him, Edie.

1544
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:27,206
So, are you leading him on
or are you leading me on?

1545
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:28,947
It's just dinner.

1546
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:30,775
Apparently not to him.

1547
01:09:30,818 --> 01:09:33,299
And frankly, not to me.

1548
01:09:33,343 --> 01:09:35,345
I'm not that guy, okay?

1549
01:09:36,302 --> 01:09:37,216
And you seem to
be having trouble

1550
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:39,262
with committing to either of us.

1551
01:09:39,305 --> 01:09:43,091
If you can't admit to Noah
that you have feelings for me,

1552
01:09:45,224 --> 01:09:49,185
then we can't be anything more
than just work colleagues.

1553
01:09:49,228 --> 01:09:50,228
Can we?

1554
01:09:53,232 --> 01:09:54,712
Bravo, darling.

1555
01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:59,282
You know, you might've
just single-handedly

1556
01:09:59,325 --> 01:10:02,415
ruined our North
American expansion.

1557
01:10:03,329 --> 01:10:04,329
You know...

1558
01:10:07,551 --> 01:10:10,815
Labor laws are a funny thing.

1559
01:10:13,165 --> 01:10:15,428
I wish I could fire you.

1560
01:10:16,429 --> 01:10:19,389
But alas, all I can
do is promote you.

1561
01:10:21,956 --> 01:10:24,263
You know, I've just got
off the phone to Richard.

1562
01:10:24,307 --> 01:10:25,569
I've been telling him all about

1563
01:10:25,612 --> 01:10:27,658
the sterling work
you've been doing here.

1564
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:33,054
Did you know he's looking
for a new creative director?

1565
01:10:33,098 --> 01:10:34,273
For the whole agency?

1566
01:10:34,317 --> 01:10:36,275
Oh, yes.

1567
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:37,319
And you've got the job.

1568
01:10:38,364 --> 01:10:39,496
Congratulations.

1569
01:10:41,846 --> 01:10:43,282
Well, you can't make me take it.

1570
01:10:43,326 --> 01:10:44,588
But why wouldn't you?

1571
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:47,591
Surely such a
promotion is within

1572
01:10:47,634 --> 01:10:49,506
your professional interest.

1573
01:10:51,334 --> 01:10:52,334
Yeah.

1574
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:55,294
Well, you'd better
book a flight, darling.

1575
01:11:00,908 --> 01:11:02,867
Who's gonna replace me here?

1576
01:11:02,910 --> 01:11:04,061
Noah, they didn't
have raspberry,

1577
01:11:04,085 --> 01:11:05,261
so I got you blueberry.

1578
01:11:07,524 --> 01:11:09,003
Where's Noah?

1579
01:11:13,747 --> 01:11:15,488
Why's everyone staring at me?

1580
01:12:30,128 --> 01:12:31,521
Don't laugh!

1581
01:12:31,564 --> 01:12:32,976
It's launching in your
gallery in less than a week.

1582
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,369
Yeah, but they know
that I don't have

1583
01:12:34,393 --> 01:12:35,873
anything to do with it.

1584
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:37,135
Don't they?

1585
01:12:37,178 --> 01:12:39,398
Meanwhile, my
name is all over it.

1586
01:12:39,442 --> 01:12:40,443
I'm kidding!

1587
01:12:40,486 --> 01:12:42,227
Edie, it's, um...

1588
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:43,402
Well, it's pretty terrible.

1589
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:47,711
But in a goofy,
Noah kind of way.

1590
01:12:47,754 --> 01:12:49,843
Have you told him yet?

1591
01:12:49,887 --> 01:12:50,931
About the campaign?

1592
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,021
What else do you
have to tell him?

1593
01:12:54,065 --> 01:12:57,068
I try, but he's just so
darn happy all the time,

1594
01:12:57,111 --> 01:12:58,286
I don't have the heart.

1595
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:00,158
It's like kicking a puppy.

1596
01:13:00,201 --> 01:13:03,117
Besides, he hired me to
handle the creatives,

1597
01:13:03,161 --> 01:13:05,076
and I've been
completely steamrolled.

1598
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:07,818
I can't work with Morgan,
she's got awful ideas,

1599
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:08,993
and Harry, he's...

1600
01:13:10,473 --> 01:13:13,040
Oh, it's okay, you can
trash talk Harry to me.

1601
01:13:13,084 --> 01:13:14,738
I don't mean to.

1602
01:13:14,781 --> 01:13:16,087
Harry's really sweet,

1603
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:20,047
but we spend three full
days shooting Noah.

1604
01:13:20,091 --> 01:13:21,397
Thousands of images.

1605
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,747
At some point, you just
need to make a decision.

1606
01:13:23,790 --> 01:13:27,228
That is the smartest
thing you've said all day.

1607
01:13:29,622 --> 01:13:30,841
So, what is your decision?

1608
01:13:30,884 --> 01:13:32,712
Are you dating Noah or not?

1609
01:13:32,756 --> 01:13:34,105
Why do people
keep asking me that?

1610
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:36,977
Because you keep going
out on dates with him.

1611
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:41,547
Am I dating Noah?

1612
01:13:44,289 --> 01:13:45,289
Not very well.

1613
01:13:51,949 --> 01:13:53,167
Room 418.

1614
01:13:53,211 --> 01:13:54,168
Enjoy your stay
with us, thank you.

1615
01:13:54,212 --> 01:13:55,213
Thank you.

1616
01:13:58,782 --> 01:13:59,652
Excuse me?

1617
01:13:59,696 --> 01:14:00,566
Yes.

1618
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:01,890
I'm looking for Harry Masters.

1619
01:14:03,569 --> 01:14:05,963
Nevermind, I think I found him.

1620
01:14:12,056 --> 01:14:16,582
I've been meaning to ask
about the campaign, Morgan.

1621
01:14:16,626 --> 01:14:18,236
Out with it!

1622
01:14:18,279 --> 01:14:21,500
Well, it's sort of similar
to the last one, isn't it?

1623
01:14:21,544 --> 01:14:23,328
I know, darling.

1624
01:14:23,371 --> 01:14:25,243
Look, Noah doesn't
care about it,

1625
01:14:25,286 --> 01:14:27,985
and quite frankly, we don't
want to overwhelm his customers.

1626
01:14:28,028 --> 01:14:29,377
They're American, remember.

1627
01:14:29,421 --> 01:14:31,597
They've got less culture
than a cup of yogurt.

1628
01:14:32,772 --> 01:14:34,513
Well, I don't think-

1629
01:14:34,557 --> 01:14:35,645
- Good.

1630
01:14:35,688 --> 01:14:37,473
You're not cut out for it.

1631
01:14:37,516 --> 01:14:38,648
Your service.

1632
01:14:39,518 --> 01:14:40,519
Right.

1633
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:49,180
What was that?

1634
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:50,486
My points, I believe.

1635
01:14:50,529 --> 01:14:54,272
It's just a
freaking game, Harry!

1636
01:14:59,799 --> 01:15:00,799
Harry!

1637
01:15:03,324 --> 01:15:04,604
Edie, what are you doing here?

1638
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,720
I need to talk to you.

1639
01:15:07,764 --> 01:15:08,547
Yeah, so why are you here?

1640
01:15:08,591 --> 01:15:09,591
This is the men's room.

1641
01:15:11,289 --> 01:15:12,725
I can't let Morgan see us.

1642
01:15:13,813 --> 01:15:14,813
Oh.

1643
01:15:16,207 --> 01:15:19,340
She does seem rather
omnipresent, doesn't she?

1644
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:24,781
The campaign is a train wreck.

1645
01:15:27,261 --> 01:15:28,261
I know.

1646
01:15:30,613 --> 01:15:31,614
It's awful.

1647
01:15:31,657 --> 01:15:33,746
We need to do something.

1648
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:34,790
I've tried.

1649
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:37,900
Believe me, but
Morgan won't listen.

1650
01:15:37,924 --> 01:15:39,447
She's like a tank.

1651
01:15:39,491 --> 01:15:42,189
The only person she'd
ever listen to is James.

1652
01:15:42,233 --> 01:15:43,843
So, we go over her head.

1653
01:15:47,717 --> 01:15:48,935
To Richard?

1654
01:15:48,979 --> 01:15:51,547
Well, we can try, but
he won't get involved.

1655
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:54,071
There's got to
be someone else.

1656
01:15:54,114 --> 01:15:57,770
I mean, technically the creative
director's more superior.

1657
01:16:00,512 --> 01:16:01,948
James.

1658
01:16:01,992 --> 01:16:02,732
Yup.

1659
01:16:02,775 --> 01:16:03,646
You already knew that.

1660
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:04,690
- Yeah.
- Oh my god.

1661
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:11,889
Does your team look up to you?

1662
01:16:12,742 --> 01:16:13,742
Come on, sit down.

1663
01:16:16,049 --> 01:16:18,878
You know, I wanted to offer
you this job when it opened up,

1664
01:16:18,922 --> 01:16:21,838
but I didn't know you
wanted to leave America

1665
01:16:21,881 --> 01:16:23,448
just after you arrived.

1666
01:16:25,493 --> 01:16:26,493
So...

1667
01:16:28,758 --> 01:16:30,673
Tell me what you're thinking.

1668
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:34,502
Uh, well, I think that the teams

1669
01:16:34,546 --> 01:16:36,940
are working pretty
well individually,

1670
01:16:36,983 --> 01:16:38,221
they're just reluctant
to collaborate-

1671
01:16:38,245 --> 01:16:39,943
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
not about work.

1672
01:16:41,205 --> 01:16:45,644
There's something else
going on, isn't there?

1673
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,042
Have you ever been in love?

1674
01:16:52,085 --> 01:16:53,347
Ah!

1675
01:16:55,611 --> 01:17:00,137
Um, three times, married four.

1676
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:01,704
Yeah.

1677
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:05,882
So, tell me about her.

1678
01:17:05,925 --> 01:17:07,274
How long you got?

1679
01:17:08,711 --> 01:17:11,801
40, 45 minutes.

1680
01:17:12,715 --> 01:17:14,760
Come on.

1681
01:17:14,804 --> 01:17:15,804
I want to hear it all.

1682
01:17:18,242 --> 01:17:19,611
I'm having a
hard time deciding between

1683
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:21,854
the fish and the steak.

1684
01:17:21,898 --> 01:17:23,290
Oh, the fish is great.

1685
01:17:23,334 --> 01:17:27,686
It's so rich and so soft.

1686
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:29,035
Yeah, it looks rich.

1687
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:30,384
Yeah, it's so rich.

1688
01:17:30,428 --> 01:17:32,691
And that butter sauce
is super mellow,

1689
01:17:32,735 --> 01:17:34,998
I mean, it's a safe choice.

1690
01:17:35,041 --> 01:17:36,564
Well, how about the steak?

1691
01:17:37,478 --> 01:17:39,002
Mm, I don't know.

1692
01:17:39,045 --> 01:17:41,352
Do you like hot English mustard?

1693
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:44,834
I mean, yeah, I
like a bit of heat.

1694
01:17:44,877 --> 01:17:46,879
I just can't do it,
it gives me hiccups.

1695
01:17:46,923 --> 01:17:49,839
But you know, you get
whatever you want.

1696
01:17:49,882 --> 01:17:51,188
Don't let me sway you.

1697
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,277
Are you ready to choose, ma'am?

1698
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,539
Yeah, I think I am.

1699
01:17:57,890 --> 01:17:58,674
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1700
01:17:58,717 --> 01:18:01,285
She told me girl guide.

1701
01:18:01,328 --> 01:18:02,547
No.

1702
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:03,722
No, no, girl scout.

1703
01:18:03,766 --> 01:18:04,984
American.

1704
01:18:05,028 --> 01:18:06,551
Oh, that Morgan,
she's a piece of work.

1705
01:18:06,594 --> 01:18:08,181
Yeah, we need another bottle
to get through all that.

1706
01:18:08,205 --> 01:18:09,119
Oh, I have one actually.

1707
01:18:09,162 --> 01:18:11,251
No, no, please.

1708
01:18:11,295 --> 01:18:12,731
My head's already spinning.

1709
01:18:12,775 --> 01:18:13,775
Oh!

1710
01:18:15,081 --> 01:18:18,476
Ah, I'm gonna be sorry
to see you leave.

1711
01:18:19,607 --> 01:18:20,783
Excuse me?

1712
01:18:20,826 --> 01:18:22,349
Well, you're going
back, of course.

1713
01:18:22,393 --> 01:18:23,350
What, to America?

1714
01:18:23,394 --> 01:18:24,134
Mhm.

1715
01:18:24,177 --> 01:18:25,439
No.

1716
01:18:25,483 --> 01:18:26,721
No, I don't want
to muck things up

1717
01:18:26,745 --> 01:18:29,182
more than I already have.

1718
01:18:29,226 --> 01:18:31,445
Well, perhaps you
could help rescue them.

1719
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:33,360
What do you mean?

1720
01:18:33,404 --> 01:18:35,449
Well, you see...

1721
01:18:35,493 --> 01:18:38,539
Your love life was
not the only thing

1722
01:18:38,583 --> 01:18:41,760
that Morgan was
sabotaging, it seems.

1723
01:18:41,804 --> 01:18:43,327
Hm?

1724
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:45,459
Yeah, the Pepper Poop
campaign is a total disaster.

1725
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:47,679
Oh, yeah, I know.

1726
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:50,682
But what do you want me to do?

1727
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,336
It's about to launch.

1728
01:18:52,379 --> 01:18:53,772
Mhm.

1729
01:18:53,816 --> 01:18:56,862
What if I told you there's
a way you could save it.

1730
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:58,603
There is?

1731
01:18:58,646 --> 01:18:59,560
Mhm.

1732
01:18:59,604 --> 01:19:00,953
You see, James...

1733
01:19:03,564 --> 01:19:07,351
Sometimes in order
to see forwards,

1734
01:19:07,394 --> 01:19:09,788
you have to look backwards.

1735
01:19:11,834 --> 01:19:13,270
To the past?

1736
01:19:13,313 --> 01:19:14,943
You think there's something
I could've done differently?

1737
01:19:14,967 --> 01:19:16,186
Probably.

1738
01:19:16,229 --> 01:19:17,927
Just look back.

1739
01:19:19,885 --> 01:19:21,800
What, I mean, me
and Edie came up with-

1740
01:19:21,844 --> 01:19:23,106
- Oh, for goodness sake,

1741
01:19:23,149 --> 01:19:24,431
you're as thick as
two short planks.

1742
01:19:24,455 --> 01:19:25,717
Just look behind you!

1743
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,026
Edie!

1744
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:31,069
Edie...

1745
01:19:33,333 --> 01:19:35,945
Developed the concept
you both came up with

1746
01:19:35,988 --> 01:19:37,294
and made it work.

1747
01:19:37,337 --> 01:19:38,948
Harry is printing
and swapping it now.

1748
01:19:40,036 --> 01:19:41,864
So, what do you need from me?

1749
01:19:42,952 --> 01:19:43,691
Authorization.

1750
01:19:43,735 --> 01:19:45,041
As creative director,

1751
01:19:45,084 --> 01:19:46,825
it's your responsibility
to maintain

1752
01:19:46,869 --> 01:19:49,697
the company's
reputation worldwide.

1753
01:19:49,741 --> 01:19:51,351
Morgan's not gonna like this.

1754
01:19:51,395 --> 01:19:53,919
James, James.

1755
01:19:53,963 --> 01:19:55,660
I believe in you.

1756
01:19:55,703 --> 01:19:57,314
You're scared of
her, aren't you?

1757
01:19:57,357 --> 01:19:58,489
Terrified.

1758
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:13,809
Are you ready for
your speech, Morgan?

1759
01:20:13,852 --> 01:20:15,767
There are few things
that I detest more

1760
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:17,464
than public speaking.

1761
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:19,901
I can do it.

1762
01:20:20,946 --> 01:20:22,426
That idea is one of them.

1763
01:20:25,168 --> 01:20:27,170
To be honest, I don't
even know what to expect.

1764
01:20:27,213 --> 01:20:28,998
I saw one mock-up early on,

1765
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:29,912
but these guys have been making

1766
01:20:29,955 --> 01:20:32,262
all sorts of changes since then.

1767
01:20:32,305 --> 01:20:33,959
Real creative types.

1768
01:20:34,003 --> 01:20:34,830
They've got me in-

1769
01:20:34,873 --> 01:20:35,873
- Wow.

1770
01:20:37,049 --> 01:20:38,746
Noah, is that...

1771
01:20:40,966 --> 01:20:42,011
Penny?

1772
01:20:43,055 --> 01:20:44,056
Um, Noah?

1773
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,797
Can I talk to you?

1774
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:48,191
Uh, yeah.

1775
01:20:48,234 --> 01:20:49,496
Yeah.

1776
01:20:49,540 --> 01:20:51,083
Mrs. Stevens, will you
excuse us for a second?

1777
01:20:51,107 --> 01:20:53,022
Sure, of course, of course.

1778
01:20:56,808 --> 01:20:58,549
Your mom doesn't know yet, huh?

1779
01:20:58,592 --> 01:21:00,899
I think she's gonna take
it harder than anyone else.

1780
01:21:02,814 --> 01:21:04,947
I enrolled in a painting class.

1781
01:21:04,990 --> 01:21:05,948
Cool!

1782
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:07,384
Noah, there's something-

1783
01:21:07,427 --> 01:21:08,665
- It just kinda helps me
take my mind off of things,

1784
01:21:08,689 --> 01:21:09,429
which is good.

1785
01:21:09,473 --> 01:21:10,213
Right.

1786
01:21:10,256 --> 01:21:11,214
But about the-

1787
01:21:11,257 --> 01:21:12,868
- Just stop.

1788
01:21:12,911 --> 01:21:14,434
It's fine.

1789
01:21:14,478 --> 01:21:15,566
I'm fine.

1790
01:21:17,307 --> 01:21:18,307
I get it.

1791
01:21:19,657 --> 01:21:22,094
You don't feel about me the
same way I feel about you.

1792
01:21:23,226 --> 01:21:24,464
It's not the first
time this has happened.

1793
01:21:24,488 --> 01:21:26,185
Noah, I do care about you.

1794
01:21:28,318 --> 01:21:30,581
You're a kind,
sweet, sensitive guy,

1795
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,322
and you're gonna
make the right woman

1796
01:21:32,365 --> 01:21:33,671
very happy someday.

1797
01:21:34,977 --> 01:21:36,500
But I'm not her.

1798
01:21:36,543 --> 01:21:38,023
I know.

1799
01:21:38,067 --> 01:21:39,068
But...

1800
01:21:41,984 --> 01:21:43,811
That's not what I
needed to tell you.

1801
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:49,426
The campaign is terrible.

1802
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,037
Oh gosh, yeah.

1803
01:21:52,081 --> 01:21:53,691
I can't stand any of it.

1804
01:21:53,734 --> 01:21:55,519
Why didn't you say something?

1805
01:21:55,562 --> 01:21:58,304
I felt bad for letting
Morgan send James back.

1806
01:22:00,002 --> 01:22:02,961
I didn't want to admit
that we needed him,

1807
01:22:03,005 --> 01:22:05,224
that I needed him.

1808
01:22:06,878 --> 01:22:11,100
And more importantly,
Edie, you needed him.

1809
01:22:13,841 --> 01:22:14,930
Well, about that...

1810
01:22:20,848 --> 01:22:22,850
We've made some changes
to the campaign.

1811
01:22:23,982 --> 01:22:25,070
I gotta talk to him.

1812
01:22:26,506 --> 01:22:27,246
Everyone's attention.

1813
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:28,900
Right, well...

1814
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:32,686
First off, please join me
in showing our appreciation

1815
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:35,341
to Jess Hammond
here for hosting us

1816
01:22:35,385 --> 01:22:36,690
in her amazing gallery.

1817
01:22:36,734 --> 01:22:37,996
Jess Hammond, everybody!

1818
01:22:44,002 --> 01:22:45,047
You came back.

1819
01:22:52,184 --> 01:22:53,794
I love her, Noah.

1820
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:56,101
Yeah.

1821
01:22:56,145 --> 01:22:57,189
Me too.

1822
01:22:59,061 --> 01:23:00,061
I'm sorry, mate.

1823
01:23:01,063 --> 01:23:03,065
I didn't want to
ruin everything.

1824
01:23:03,108 --> 01:23:06,242
No, it's not
about what you want,

1825
01:23:07,243 --> 01:23:08,722
it's not about what I want.

1826
01:23:09,897 --> 01:23:11,812
It's about what Edie
wants, isn't it?

1827
01:23:15,033 --> 01:23:17,470
She lights up whenever
she's around you, James.

1828
01:23:19,081 --> 01:23:20,734
Even when she's angry.

1829
01:23:20,778 --> 01:23:21,779
Mm.

1830
01:23:21,822 --> 01:23:24,042
Especially when she's angry.

1831
01:23:28,307 --> 01:23:29,352
Let's grab a drink.

1832
01:23:34,226 --> 01:23:35,793
It is a privilege, of course,

1833
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:40,841
for any agency new to these
shores, or well established,

1834
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,495
to work with...

1835
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,020
Poop.

1836
01:23:46,934 --> 01:23:47,934
Noah Poop.

1837
01:23:49,894 --> 01:23:51,591
Sorry, Noah Pepper.

1838
01:23:51,635 --> 01:23:56,248
Um, I hope you all enjoy
watching the campaign

1839
01:23:56,292 --> 01:23:59,077
as much as we've
enjoyed giving it life,

1840
01:23:59,121 --> 01:24:02,472
and please, don't
forget to promote us.

1841
01:24:02,515 --> 01:24:04,561
So, without further ado,

1842
01:24:05,779 --> 01:24:09,348
we give to you Pepper Poop

1843
01:24:09,392 --> 01:24:12,395
like you have never
seen it before.

1844
01:24:42,381 --> 01:24:44,122
Surprise!

1845
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:45,689
I know it's not what
you're expecting,

1846
01:24:45,732 --> 01:24:46,777
but we did it!

1847
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:48,213
Eh...

1848
01:24:48,257 --> 01:24:51,129
You did something, but
you didn't do that.

1849
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:54,488
I'm just happy
these two were here.

1850
01:24:54,524 --> 01:24:56,091
And Harry.

1851
01:24:56,134 --> 01:24:57,198
If you hadn't make me
take thousands of photos,

1852
01:24:57,222 --> 01:24:58,745
we wouldn't of had
what we needed.

1853
01:24:58,789 --> 01:25:01,139
I always say, you could
never take too many photos.

1854
01:25:01,183 --> 01:25:03,446
I've heard all about
your games, Morgan.

1855
01:25:03,489 --> 01:25:06,188
And unfortunately,
I can't promote you.

1856
01:25:06,231 --> 01:25:07,232
But I can fire you.

1857
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:10,061
We'll take it from here.

1858
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,671
You presumptuous little toad.

1859
01:25:11,715 --> 01:25:13,978
I am the agency in America.

1860
01:25:14,021 --> 01:25:16,111
Actually, Morgan, you're not.

1861
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:17,938
Excuse me, Mor-

1862
01:25:17,982 --> 01:25:18,982
- Oh, shut up, Harry!

1863
01:25:20,202 --> 01:25:21,594
What do you think you're doing?

1864
01:25:21,638 --> 01:25:22,856
Pulling rank.

1865
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:26,947
Richard would like
a word with you.

1866
01:25:26,991 --> 01:25:28,427
Richard, darling.

1867
01:25:30,342 --> 01:25:31,735
Yeah, no...

1868
01:25:31,778 --> 01:25:32,779
You can't...

1869
01:25:32,823 --> 01:25:33,780
Hang on, you can't-

1870
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,694
- Wait a minute,
that's my phone.

1871
01:25:34,738 --> 01:25:35,826
Just a second.

1872
01:25:35,869 --> 01:25:36,869
Richard, please.

1873
01:25:39,482 --> 01:25:43,616
Well, I'm gonna go make
sure the bar's stocked.

1874
01:25:49,753 --> 01:25:51,189
Shall we go somewhere quieter?

1875
01:26:08,859 --> 01:26:12,906
It seems like we've run
out of things to talk about.

1876
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:13,950
Shut up.

1877
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:17,302
That's another way to put it.

1878
01:26:21,001 --> 01:26:22,264
That's better.

1879
01:26:24,744 --> 01:26:26,904
- Can I have your number-
- Do you want my number now?

1880
01:27:40,603 --> 01:27:42,387
That went great, Noah.

1881
01:27:42,431 --> 01:27:43,997
Thanks.

1882
01:27:44,041 --> 01:27:47,349
You look amazing, by the way.

1883
01:27:47,392 --> 01:27:48,350
Really?

1884
01:27:48,393 --> 01:27:49,438
Yeah.

1885
01:27:49,481 --> 01:27:50,481
I was like...

1886
01:27:51,701 --> 01:27:53,311
Wow.

1887
01:27:53,355 --> 01:27:54,355
Thank you.

1888
01:27:55,052 --> 01:27:56,401
Um...

1889
01:27:56,445 --> 01:27:57,576
I'm sorry about Edie.

1890
01:27:59,839 --> 01:28:00,839
It's okay.

1891
01:28:02,451 --> 01:28:06,455
Have you ever loved
someone so much that

1892
01:28:06,498 --> 01:28:08,370
you feel like they
don't even see you?

1893
01:28:09,632 --> 01:28:10,850
Yeah.

1894
01:28:10,894 --> 01:28:12,852
Yeah, I know exactly
how that feels.

1895
01:28:12,896 --> 01:28:15,377
I mean, maybe I don't love Edie.

1896
01:28:16,813 --> 01:28:18,815
Maybe I just love
the idea of her.

1897
01:28:18,858 --> 01:28:19,729
And she's a creative.

1898
01:28:19,772 --> 01:28:20,772
Exactly!

1899
01:28:21,861 --> 01:28:24,124
I should find somebody
in the industry.

1900
01:28:24,168 --> 01:28:26,301
Somebody who knows
how to support you.

1901
01:28:26,344 --> 01:28:28,738
Someone who loves fertilizer.

1902
01:28:28,781 --> 01:28:29,802
And would do literally anything

1903
01:28:29,826 --> 01:28:31,393
to be noticed by you.

1904
01:28:31,436 --> 01:28:33,612
Oh, I would definitely notice.

1905
01:28:36,441 --> 01:28:37,312
Yeah?

1906
01:28:37,355 --> 01:28:38,487
Yeah.

1907
01:28:38,530 --> 01:28:40,576
And I would never let her go.

1908
01:28:43,796 --> 01:28:44,796
Well, goodnight.

1909
01:28:47,409 --> 01:28:48,409
Okay, goodnight.
