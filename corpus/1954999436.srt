1
00:00:49,883 --> 00:00:53,803
Some people can see
all your mistakes.

2
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,597
The way you hold it
in your shoulders.

3
00:00:56,724 --> 00:01:01,018
Show it in your face.

4
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,813
I made a lot of mistakes
in my life

5
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:08,025
and they were
my mistakes.

6
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,695
Nobody else's.

7
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,072
Mine.

8
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,283
When you get older,
all those mistakes

9
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,703
start piling up inside you.

10
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:22,165
Regrets, blame.

11
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,210
It's enough to make you
sick to your stomach.

12
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:32,717
Problem is,
there are certain things

13
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,927
that I just can't
change about myself.

14
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,283
Fill it up, will you?

15
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,626
- Morning.
- Good morning.

16
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,085
$20 on eight, please?

17
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,008
Where are your cards?

18
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,428
Cards... Backside of
this aisle right here.

19
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,236
He almost finished
out there?

20
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,946
Yeah, almost.

21
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:47,041
9-1-1. What's your emergency?

22
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,378
Hello? What's the address
of your emergency?

23
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,675
That'll be it.

24
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:59,136
Okay, $20 on
the pump, $24.

25
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,305
$24. That's a steal.

26
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,521
You have a good day.

27
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,738
Boy.

28
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,164
You're the one
from the paper.

29
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,918
I think you got me confused
with somebody else, all right?

30
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,880
No. I know who you are.

31
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,173
I know who he is too.

32
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,192
The truth, sir...

33
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:02,259
I assume you're a friend.

34
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,594
I'm sorry.

35
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,514
A friend of
the family?

36
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,515
Yeah.

37
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,100
I'm sorry for your loss.

38
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:13,771
What's gonna happen
with the boy?

39
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,440
He's going to his
grandparents' place.

40
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,192
Where were they?

41
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,070
They live in
Farmington, New Mexico.

42
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,280
But I hear his
grandfather's gravely ill.

43
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,366
You driving him?

44
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,869
Oh, no. I'm just gonna chauffer him
over to the bus station.

45
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,287
Do you know Louis?

46
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,831
No.

47
00:05:31,957 --> 00:05:34,375
Thank the Lord,
he's got his grandparents.

48
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,960
Yeah.

49
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,589
All right, son.
You ready?

50
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,383
Yes, sir.

51
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,719
Let me help you.

52
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,516
Right over here.

53
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,570
All right, son.

54
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,622
So all right.
Here we go.

55
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:14,999
Now I've got your ticket.

56
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,417
Your money's
in the envelope.

57
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,669
They're gonna put your skis
and bags underneath.

58
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:24,133
I hate buses.

59
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:25,593
Can't you
just drive me?

60
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,637
Aw, son, I'm needed here.
But you'll be fine.

61
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:30,556
Nothing to worry about, okay?

62
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,311
It's uh...
It was nice meeting you.

63
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,104
You too, Louis.

64
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,109
I'll be praying
for you, son.

65
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,785
Hey, Louis.
I'm John.

66
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,495
Yeah, you were at the church.

67
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,330
That's right, that's right.

68
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,665
Nice to meet you.

69
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,291
Listen, I'm sorry
about your mother.

70
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,459
It's a shame.

71
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,422
Listen, I just got a phone call
from your grandparents.

72
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,966
Apparently, they don't
love the idea of you

73
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,927
riding on this bus
for three days.

74
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,345
They asked me if
I'd give you a lift.

75
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,763
Meanwhile, I was headed
that way

76
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,431
so I told them, shit, why not?

77
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,602
Sir, I don't know you.

78
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,730
Yeah, well, I don't really
know you either and,

79
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,440
frankly, this is
a pain in my ass.

80
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,110
But, like I said,
I know your grandparents

81
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,446
and your mother was a...
She was a good woman.

82
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,741
You knew my mom?

83
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,326
Yeah.

84
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,772
She never really
talked about you.

85
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,745
Yeah?

86
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:21,709
Well, I guess I didn't make much of
an impression then, did I?

87
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,586
We kept in touch.
I'd call, she'd call.

88
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,504
- You know how it goes.
- Yeah.

89
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,381
Listen, I got to hit the road.

90
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,383
I understand if you don't
want to come with me.

91
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,010
Besides, buses ain't so bad.

92
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:35,472
Perfectly civilized mode of
transportation, if you ask me.

93
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,017
But, hey,

94
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,520
good luck to you, kid,

95
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:47,026
and my deepest condolences to
you and your family, all right?

96
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,324
Kid, you getting
on the bus? I gotta go.

97
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,495
Sir.

98
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,164
Sir?

99
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,676
Get in.

100
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:22,228
You, uh... You live in
this car or something?

101
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,520
No, of course not.

102
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,564
I just wasn't
expecting guests.

103
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,082
Your mother was
a wonderful woman.

104
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:47,920
Classy lady, fun gal.
Full of spirit.

105
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:48,921
She was...

106
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:53,425
Sparky.

107
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,095
- Oh...
- She was...

108
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,596
I forgot.

109
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:03,435
What do you got there?
Pictures.

110
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,561
Ah.

111
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,563
This is
my grandparents' house.

112
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:11,568
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Good, that's good.

113
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:19,576
You know, the only time I really visited
them was when I was little.

114
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,288
Mom didn't get along with
my grandparents too well.

115
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,581
Didn't really talk.

116
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,251
Hey, how long do you
think it'll take?

117
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,919
I don't know.

118
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,175
What?

119
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,595
Nothing.

120
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,516
Hey, I got to make
a couple quick calls.

121
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,727
Should just take me
a couple minutes.

122
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,325
- Moody residence.
- Mrs. Moody?

123
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,202
John Wheeler here.
How you doing?

124
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,122
You have got some
nerve calling here.

125
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,625
I was just at your daughter's
wake. Where were you?

126
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,296
Earl's sick.
Now what do you want?

127
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,133
I got Louis, her boy.

128
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,510
What... why would
you have Louis?

129
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,596
Now, look, there's been
a change of plans.

130
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,639
I'm gonna drive him home.

131
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,434
Where's that priest?
Put Louis on the phone.

132
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,727
It'll just take
a couple of days.

133
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,520
You got nothing
to worry about.

134
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:32,649
Now you put Louis back on
that bus and get back...

135
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,410
One more stop.

136
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,651
Stay here.

137
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,694
Hey, I need that
to get home!

138
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,661
What's up, John?

139
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:30,290
Will you excuse us
for a moment, please?

140
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,708
Okay, thanks.

141
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,729
This is a fucking joke,
right?

142
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,274
There's a little over
6,000 bucks right there.

143
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,902
You're short $14,000
and change. Maybe more.

144
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,780
Well, what are you...
you said $10,000.

145
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,449
I owe you $10,000.

146
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:08,245
You're late, John, again.
So it's $20.

147
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:12,875
What are you doing, huh?

148
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,668
How long have
we known each other?

149
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,296
Long enough for you
to know better.

150
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,840
This is fucking bullshit, John!
Do you understand?

151
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:23,760
What the fuck
do you want from me?

152
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,762
John,

153
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:29,766
protection in jail
is very expensive.

154
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,435
Do you understand that?

155
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,770
I didn't ask you for
any goddamned protection.

156
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,939
Yeah, but you took it.

157
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,609
You know jail could have
been dangerous for you, John.

158
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,405
I'm living out of my car.

159
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,951
I don't have
anything else.

160
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,797
I just gave you everything
that I got, okay?

161
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:53,123
Boy, do you want
to go back to jail?

162
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,459
You like the bed and the three meals of
crap they serve you every day?

163
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:58,378
'Cause I can arrange that with
just one fucking phone call.

164
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,671
Freddy, give me
the fucking phone.

165
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,797
No, no, no, no.

166
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,362
You're not gonna
make any phone calls.

167
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,801
I got just as much shit
on you as you got on me.

168
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:07,763
6,000 bucks.
That's all you get.

169
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,261
We're closed!

170
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,222
We're closed!

171
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,478
Goddamn kid.

172
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,627
Hey, are you in
some kind of trouble?

173
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:28,594
It's nothing.

174
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,263
Did they
do that to you?

175
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,140
I don't know
what I was thinking.

176
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:34,891
You ain't worth the trouble.

177
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,451
The closest I could
get you is Albuquerque.

178
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:56,788
I'll call your grandma and have her
pick you up in a couple of days.

179
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,665
Good to meet you.

180
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,958
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

181
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,793
Louis!

182
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,630
Louis!

183
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,055
Louis?

184
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,060
Louis.

185
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:50,902
Hey.

186
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,029
Hey, I'm talking to you.

187
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,038
I don't want
to be alone.

188
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:12,048
Why did she have to die?

189
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:17,012
There's no good reason.

190
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,056
I don't know, man.

191
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,310
I don't have anyone else.

192
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,399
Hey, you're
gonna be all right.

193
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,753
Hey! Hey!

194
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,384
Hey, let's get
something to eat.

195
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,344
I'm hungry.

196
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,931
What's with these skis?

197
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:45,100
For skiing.

198
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,103
Yeah, well, there ain't
no snow around here.

199
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,858
The skis were a gift
from my mom.

200
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:55,026
You probably never
even skied before.

201
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,695
She wanted me to learn.

202
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,154
Skiing's expensive.

203
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,156
I just saved you
a shitload of money.

204
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,867
It was the last thing
she gave me before she died.

205
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,869
Yeah, it's a dumb sport.

206
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,475
I can't believe all you got was
$20 bucks and that stupid ring!

207
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:08,498
Are you hungry?
I'm starving.

208
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,833
Let's go.

209
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,758
Mm, mm.

210
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,177
Good.

211
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,891
What, you're not gonna eat?

212
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,183
I'm not hungry.

213
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,811
Fine with me. Starve.

214
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,942
Look at that
little piece of ass.

215
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,739
Hey, you like women?

216
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,449
Yeah, I guess.

217
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,659
You guess?

218
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,120
All right, well, know this.

219
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:48,872
A scorned woman will
tear your heart out,

220
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,082
put it between
two buns and eat it

221
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,668
just as your life
slips away before you.

222
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,212
Don't ever forget that.

223
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,174
Hey, you wanna drive?

224
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,970
Yeah? You wanna drive?

225
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:07,474
All right, can you
see over the hood?

226
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,392
I guess.

227
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,978
All right.
Your feet touch the pedals?

228
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,813
I think so.

229
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,608
You think so or you can?
It's kind of a big deal.

230
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,193
- Yeah, fine.
- Okay, all right.

231
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,945
So this is an automatic.

232
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,781
So all you gotta do is pull that
lever down from P to D.

233
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,240
There you go.

234
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,409
All right, now take your
foot off the brake.

235
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,579
Push down on the gas.

236
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,414
There you go.

237
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,922
All you gotta do is avoid other
cars and that's pretty much it.

238
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,174
How fast you going?

239
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,259
Uh, 32 mph.

240
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,970
No, no, no.
You gotta get it up.

241
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,263
At least 50 or 60, even 70.

242
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:54,270
There you go. See, faster is
way better, isn't it?

243
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,440
You're blind! Oh!

244
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,526
Oh!

245
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:07,325
All right, the first rule to
gun fighting is having a gun.

246
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,744
All right, I prefer
to have something small.

247
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,454
Something easier to carry.

248
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,873
Easier to conceal,
all right?

249
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,750
Can't go hunting with
something like this, though.

250
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,085
Why not?

251
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,754
You just can't.
It ain't right.

252
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,297
What's the point, then?

253
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:23,883
The point is,
if I have the gun...

254
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,430
I have the control, right?

255
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,849
You want to give it a shot?

256
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,396
If I let you shoot this,
you owe me a favor.

257
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,981
Okay.

258
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,315
All right.

259
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,319
Go ahead.

260
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:55,498
Go ahead,
shoot it again.

261
00:22:58,794 --> 00:22:59,669
All right.

262
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,839
Turn it, gangster style.

263
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,466
There you go.

264
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,094
Let's go.

265
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,476
Hey, give me my gun.

266
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:38,374
Wake up.
Wake up.

267
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,795
It's time for that favor.

268
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,692
All right, now keep
the engine running.

269
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,403
Don't turn it off for any
reason, you understand?

270
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,322
Where you going?

271
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,075
I gotta run inside and
grab a couple of things.

272
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,284
Just keep it running.
I'll be right back.

273
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,411
Now jump in
the driver's seat.

274
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,205
Wait, what?

275
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:33,429
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

276
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,436
Let me know if I can
help you with anything.

277
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:44,023
We got some
specials back there.

278
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,357
Are you gonna get it?

279
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:30,153
Yeah, that should...
oh, the newspaper.

280
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,487
Get on the ground.

281
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,661
Get on the fucking ground!

282
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,458
- Get on the goddamned...
- I heard you!

283
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,982
- I'll beat you with this fucking gun!
- I heard you, damn it!

284
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,315
Listen, this store's all I got.
You leave me something you hear?

285
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:08,483
There you go.

286
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,526
You're a real
son of a bitch.

287
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,491
Hey! What the hell
are you doing?

288
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,410
Hey, hey!

289
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,454
Get out of the fucking car!
Get out...

290
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,997
Hands off the boy!

291
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,250
Easy, easy!

292
00:26:25,376 --> 00:26:26,960
Go!

293
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,216
Ha!

294
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,510
All right!
Now keep it up over 70.

295
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,074
Keep it on the right side
of the road.

296
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,471
- Just like I told you.
- I'm gonna be sick.

297
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,265
What do you mean,
you feel sick?

298
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:42,558
- I'm sick, I'm sick.
- What are you doing?

299
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,559
Hey! Hey!

300
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,895
Get in the back!
Get in the back!

301
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,147
Go, go, go, go!

302
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:55,697
Oh, shit!
God damn it!

303
00:26:59,493 --> 00:27:01,369
Son of a bitch!

304
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:03,579
- I need some air.
- Yeah, well, shut up!

305
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,376
I need air.

306
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:14,549
- I need some air!
- What are you doing?

307
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,759
Shut that door!

308
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:21,556
No!

309
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,104
No!

310
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,025
God damn it! God damn it!

311
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:48,958
Stay here.

312
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,877
Where you going?

313
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,439
Get your things.

314
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,775
- Where'd you get that car?
- Shut up and get in!

315
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,568
Did you steal it?

316
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,489
I will leave you here.
I swear to God, I will!

317
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:42,678
You cost me a lot
of money today.

318
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,681
I don't want anything
to do with you.

319
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:49,227
Well, that's not
an option, is it?

320
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:52,438
You can't make me stay.

321
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,606
I can leave.

322
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,233
Just hitchhike.

323
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,611
Yeah, okay.
You're gonna hitchhike?

324
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,446
Yeah.

325
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:09,997
Why don't we find a place
to sleep tonight?

326
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:10,998
With a bed?

327
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:14,001
Yeah, sure.
Why not?

328
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:16,712
Fine.

329
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:29,642
You awake?

330
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,477
What?

331
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,729
Just wanted to see
if you were awake.

332
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,736
Why'd you do it?

333
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,737
Do what?

334
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,449
Rob that place.

335
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:48,744
Because we didn't have
any money and we needed it.

336
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,329
To get me home?

337
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,415
Yeah, to get you home.

338
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,625
Food and gas.

339
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,128
This bed.

340
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,088
Why do you live in your car?

341
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,760
Because I can't
afford anything else.

342
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,554
Most adults have jobs...

343
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,722
Just go to bed, Louis.

344
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,975
Just go the fuck
to bed, please.

345
00:31:16,083 --> 00:31:17,291
All right.

346
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:20,836
When you're done in there,

347
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,713
I want you to pull
the truck around.

348
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,839
Understand?

349
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,551
Hey, you paying
attention to me?

350
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:29,637
Yeah. I heard you.

351
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,222
God damn it,
you pay attention!

352
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:33,307
Wake up!

353
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,060
You're not gonna go
fucking this up for me again.

354
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,340
All right, Louis.

355
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,217
Stop fucking around
and open up the door.

356
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,885
A couple of days.

357
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:11,804
That's how long
you said it would take.

358
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,265
You're a liar.

359
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,643
Open up the door.

360
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,061
Come on!

361
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,774
The fucking...
Open up the fucking door!

362
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,818
God damn it! Okay.

363
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:29,405
Now take your hands off the wheel
and get out of the car.

364
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:30,948
Just one more day
and I'll take you

365
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,450
to your grandparent's,
all right? Now come on.

366
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:35,911
Open it up, please.

367
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,917
You need me.

368
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:57,099
Hello.
How's your day?

369
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,102
Oh, just going great.

370
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,937
Good-looking boy
you got there.

371
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,857
Yeah, yeah, he
is adorable, isn't he?

372
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,734
Got a daughter myself.

373
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,820
Huh. I'll take $20
on two, please.

374
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,490
No gas. Pump's broke.
Been broke for months.

375
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:15,076
Oh, shit, all right.

376
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:19,914
Would you grab me a can of that
Black Bear Longcut Wintergreen?

377
00:33:24,378 --> 00:33:26,962
You don't want any
trouble now, do you?

378
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,050
- Open it up.
- Yeah.

379
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,135
Ain't much in there.

380
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,970
Well, that'll do.

381
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,892
Boy, what are you doing?
Come on!

382
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,102
This ain't no fucking library!
Hurry up!

383
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:43,270
Quit pissing around!

384
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:44,480
Now get back there
and clean that up.

385
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:45,981
Come on.

386
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:03,582
Come on.

387
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:07,128
In and out just like
a couple of ghosts.

388
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:08,546
Gimme that.

389
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,801
Thank you, sir.

390
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,896
You got a safe?

391
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,123
Christ!

392
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,000
Go, go, go, go!

393
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,551
Fuck you!

394
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,054
God damn it!

395
00:34:59,639 --> 00:34:59,680
God damn it,
I can't believe that.

396
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:03,934
God damn it,
I can't believe that.

397
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,937
Shit.

398
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,606
I'll tell you what, boy.

399
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,649
Life can be
such a bore sometimes.

400
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:15,362
But this...
This is great.

401
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:19,074
Well, don't
look at me like that.

402
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,661
You and me make
a really, really good team.

403
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:26,165
Shit, they probably got
nicknames for us already.

404
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,000
Who? The papers?

405
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,878
Yeah.

406
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,404
Don't they have
better things to do?

407
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,090
Shit, no. Bonnie and Clyde
was all over the newspapers.

408
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,426
Billy the Kid, too.
He was famous.

409
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,094
Like in movies?

410
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:42,097
- Exactly.
- Mm-hmm.

411
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:47,144
You know, in the movies,
they all got shot to death.

412
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,107
Aren't you having fun?

413
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:53,818
If I was your age,
I'd be having fun.

414
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:56,654
No, I'm not having fun.

415
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:01,826
You think this
is easy for me?

416
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,119
Dragging your skinny
little ass all over the place?

417
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,121
This ain't no fucking
holiday, all right?

418
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,998
This is a job.

419
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,084
This is work driving you home.

420
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:17,424
You know, it'll all be
over soon enough, all right?

421
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:19,385
Yeah, I hope so.

422
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,141
Did you, uh...

423
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:29,603
Did you see that shotgun under
the counter earlier today?

424
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:30,855
No.

425
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,147
No?

426
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:33,858
I just figured you
might have seen it

427
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,943
underneath there when you
were, you know, down below...

428
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:38,153
I didn't see any gun.

429
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,365
Okay.

430
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,747
Ma'am?

431
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,750
Do you have
chocolate ice cream?

432
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,836
I'll have to check
in the freezer.

433
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:57,172
Okay. Well, we'd like
one scoop.

434
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,966
Two spoons for me
and the boy, please.

435
00:36:59,092 --> 00:37:01,886
One scoop and two spoons.

436
00:37:02,012 --> 00:37:02,887
Two spoons.
That's right.

437
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,430
Okay.

438
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,227
Let's go.

439
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,313
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Ice cream.

440
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,315
We're leaving.
Come on.

441
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,109
- We have plenty of money.
- We gotta keep moving.

442
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:18,313
I'm not even done
eating yet.

443
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,946
Yes, you are.
Let's go.

444
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,208
Get out here!

445
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,462
God damn it.

446
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:41,342
Here we go, honey.
One scoop and two spoons.

447
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:42,468
I love chocolate.

448
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,552
Thank you.

449
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,221
Oh, he just needed
some fresh air.

450
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:48,515
Uh, he'll be back, right?

451
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:49,767
- Yes.
- Okay.

452
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:54,229
I can share if you want some.

453
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,356
Honey, I don't
need the calories.

454
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,733
You enjoy that
chocolate ice cream.

455
00:37:57,859 --> 00:37:59,985
Let me know if I can
do something for you.

456
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,654
Thank you.

457
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,920
That'll be $14.50.

458
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:19,046
Thank you.

459
00:38:19,172 --> 00:38:20,839
You're welcome, sweetie.

460
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,511
I'll tell you what.

461
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:29,390
You tell his mama that
she raised a gem of a boy.

462
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:31,809
Yeah, I'll be sure
to tell her that.

463
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,489
We gotta get rid
of that truck.

464
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,033
I like that truck.

465
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:32,453
Yeah, well, it's not
safe to drive anymore.

466
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,237
Come on, let's go.

467
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,621
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

468
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:20,501
Come on, lady!
I got a kid here!

469
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:21,627
Jesus Christ.

470
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:22,961
We should have
kept the truck.

471
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,672
Yeah, well...

472
00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:29,093
Hey!

473
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:32,596
Just keep walking.
Just keep walking.

474
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,185
Shit!

475
00:40:38,311 --> 00:40:39,770
Keep your mouth shut.

476
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:42,272
Neither one of us want
to go to jail, right?

477
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:50,864
Hello, Officer!

478
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,201
Hitchhiking is illegal.

479
00:40:54,327 --> 00:40:56,411
Particularly on Sunday.

480
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,789
Yeah, our car broke down.

481
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:02,417
Uh-huh.
Let me see some ID.

482
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,169
Come on.

483
00:41:07,507 --> 00:41:10,968
Turn around, over there.
Spread your legs. Come on.

484
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,302
Where you headed?

485
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:16,431
Uh, his grandparents' place.

486
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,308
I'm real sorry
about this, officer.

487
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,186
It's just that, you know,
we didn't have much of a choice.

488
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,481
Our truck broke
down back there, so...

489
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,442
Well, now is it a car
or is it a truck?

490
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,822
He meant car.

491
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,991
You better both come with me.

492
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:35,784
We'll clear this up
down at the station.

493
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,578
Come on.

494
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,212
Uh, sir?

495
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,715
We're just on our
way to church.

496
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,383
What was that?

497
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,636
We're going to church
to pray for my mom.

498
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,055
Yeah, his mama died.

499
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:58,765
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

500
00:41:58,892 --> 00:42:01,476
Is that right, son?
Your mama just died?

501
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,479
Yes, sir.
Just last week.

502
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,232
I'm sorry to hear that.

503
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,817
All right, get in the car.
I'll give you a ride.

504
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,360
- Come on.
- No, no, we can do...

505
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,154
No, it's all right.
Don't worry.

506
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,073
Come on.
Don't make me wait.

507
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,284
Can I sit in the front?

508
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:19,870
Sure.

509
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:24,458
Thank you, Officer!

510
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:26,501
Thank you, Officer!

511
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:33,467
All right, let's get
the hell out of here.

512
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:37,221
Hey, where you going?

513
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:38,639
Church.

514
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:40,515

I am so pleased to see some
visitors with us this morning.

529
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,528
Come on up here, son.

530
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:37,030
Come on up here, son!

531
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,448
I'm not gonna bite you.

532
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,825
Come join me here.

533
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:42,619
There you go.
Let him by there.

534
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,913
Here you are.

535
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:46,581
What is your name, son?

536
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,582
Louis.

537
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,503
Everyone please welcome
our child of God, Louis.

538
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,630
- Welcome, Louis.
- Welcome.

539
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:55,382
What is your name?

540
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:56,883
John.

541
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,176
- John.
- Yep.

542
00:43:58,303 --> 00:43:59,344
Why won't you join us?

543
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,096
Nah, I'm good right here.

544
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,307
No, no. I'm extending my hand
in the name of the Lord

545
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:05,600
so we may greet you
as a congregation.

546
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:09,146
If you wouldn't mind removing your cap
here in the house of the Lord?

547
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:16,403
Everyone please welcome
these brothers in Christ,

548
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,697
John and Louis.

549
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,907
Welcome, John and Louis.

550
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:23,952
Thank you.

551
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,537
Thank you.

552
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,955
Yeah, can we sit?

553
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,373
- Please do.
- All right.

554
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,876
Take your seat, gentlemen.

555
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,226
We don't see too many
new faces around here.

556
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,645
It's exciting when we do.

557
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,397
We won't be staying for long.

558
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,191
What, you just
passing through?

559
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:55,942
Yeah.

560
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:58,195
Listen, I want you
to know something.

561
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,404
You're welcome to stay
as long as you like.

562
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,325
My mission is
to grow this family.

563
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,952
Spread the word of God.

564
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,791
Well, like I said,
we won't be staying for long.

565
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,668
All right.

566
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,547
He's a quiet one.

567
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:19,758
Got many friends?

568
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,843
I have no idea.

569
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,428
A boy needs friends, you know.

570
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,138
Jesus had 12 of them.

571
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,681
Yeah.

572
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,225
Well, look what good
that did him.

573
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,686
Listen, we're having
a retreat tonight.

574
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:32,938
Want to stick around?
The boy will love it.

575
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:34,064
You gonna have
food there?

576
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,693
We'll have food there.

577
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:41,071
One piece of advice.

578
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:43,031
What's that?

579
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,701
You want to save a little room
for the coconut cream pie.

580
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,453
Good to know.

581
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,415
Louis, hello, my friend.

582
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:52,958
- Hi.
- How are you, son?

583
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,709
Good, thank you.

584
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,710
I'm gonna sit here and
join you if you don't mind.

585
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:56,962
It's fine.

586
00:45:57,088 --> 00:45:58,046
We're happy to have
you with us today.

587
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,840
Happy to be here.

588
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,509
So tell me about yourself.

589
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,755
Hey.

590
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,758
Louis. Louis?
Hey, hey, wake up.

591
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:48,763
We gotta hit the road.
Come on.

592
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,141
What the hell is...

593
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:57,689
What the hell
are you doing?

594
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,524
- Come on.
- I don't want... I'm not fucking leaving!

595
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,485
Come on, it's time to go.

596
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:04,362
- What the hell's your problem?
- Hey, come on!

597
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,657
Come on!

598
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,416
This is yours.

599
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,386
I hate you.

600
00:47:29,472 --> 00:47:31,598
I think you were scared.

601
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:34,976
You're scared they'd find out
you're a bad person.

602
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,812
A wolf, like
the pastor said.

603
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,774
A wolf?
He called me a wolf?

604
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:43,818
Beware of false prophets
who wear sheep's clothing

605
00:47:43,903 --> 00:47:47,989
because really
they're ravenous wolves.

606
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:51,159
He said that?

607
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:55,080
That's...

608
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,498
I'm not doing
this anymore.

609
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:57,499
What do you mean,
you're not doing this?

610
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:58,750
I'm not doing it.

611
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,086
Hey, get up!
Come on!

612
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:02,921
We've been over this!

613
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:05,215
Hey, get up!

614
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:06,841
We gotta keep moving.

615
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,762
Hey!

616
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,764
Can't just sit
around all day!

617
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,849
Come on!
Let's go!

618
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,321
Thank you.

619
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,365
I need a lift for me
and my friend back here.

620
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,617
Just take a minute.
Hold on one second.

621
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,828
Louis! Come on!

622
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:46,423
Louis.

623
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,819
Grab our things and take
them to the room, will ya?

624
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:08,987
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

625
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,697
How long?

626
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,033
I don't know.
As long as it takes me.

627
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,503
Give me a whiskey
and a beer chaser.

628
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:02,290
- Oh, God.
- Okay.

629
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,958
Ah!

630
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,633
I don't know where the damn kid is.

631
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:20,618
How can you drink those things?

632
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:22,036
They give me heartburn.

633
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:26,166
Yeah? I think they're just
fine in the morning.

634
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,211
Oh, there he is!

635
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,796
Great.

636
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,924
This is Louis,
Louis Moody.

637
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,051
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

638
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:41,389
I'm Mary.
This is Rose.

639
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,308
Mary and Rose are
headed into Mexico.

640
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,393
That's right.
You're gonna pay for the gas, huh?

641
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,061
'Cause she pissed off
our meal ticket!

642
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,063
Oh, Rose, shut up!

643
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,065
So there you have it.

644
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,550
Well, get in.
You're driving, right?

645
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:53,902
Oh, yeah.

646
00:51:58,073 --> 00:51:59,866
Should I put
the stuff in the trunk?

647
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,451
- Just throw it in the back.
- Back there?

648
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:04,454
Why don't you guys both
get in the way back?

649
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:08,500
We got some adult
conversations to have.

650
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:13,880
Get in.

651
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,465
This is gonna be fun.

652
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:32,106
Were you the one
knocking on my wall?

653
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:34,651
No.

654
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:37,779
Yes, you were.

655
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,155
Why didn't
you knock back?

656
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,698
That's how it works,
you know.

657
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:41,991
You're supposed
to knock back.

658
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,244
I don't know.

659
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,079
How old are you anyway?

660
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,456
I'm 13.

661
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,167
Well, I mean, I guess, 14.

662
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,462
I'm 13.

663
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,881
Is that your mom?

664
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,883
You could call her that.

665
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:03,429
It's that you don't look
like each other, so...

666
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:04,848
I was just wondering.

667
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:08,226
People say I take
after my dad.

668
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:10,144
People say I take
after my mom.

669
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,907
That's an amethyst.

670
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,617
That's turquoise.

671
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,912
Oh, I know turquoise. I got a...
check that out.

672
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,330
Brand new ring.

673
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:32,083
- That's nice.
- Turquoise.

674
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,168
Well, that's what
they call kismet.

675
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,087
Oh, yeah?
What's that mean?

676
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:39,674
Well, it's a Middle Eastern word
for coincidence or serendipity.

677
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,552
Ah, kismet.

678
00:53:42,678 --> 00:53:43,970
Kismet.

679
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:46,764
So here's the deal.
You pay for the gas.

680
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:48,291
We'll pay for our
own lodging, okay?

681
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,976
All right.

682
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,979
You know, I don't just let
any stranger into my car.

683
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:55,189
These are unique circumstances,
you understand?

684
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:57,942
I understand
completely,

685
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,862
and we're not exactly
strangers at this point.

686
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:03,740
Just don't get any ideas,
lover boy.

687
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,199
I won't get any.

688
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,119
Well, I might get
a couple ideas.

689
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,622
I'll just keep 'em
right up in here.

690
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,317
Don't go telling 'em
too much about yourself.

691
00:54:39,443 --> 00:54:42,695
Remember what
I told you about women.

692
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,782
Well, look at us.
Just like one big happy family.

693
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:47,867
Hardly.

694
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:48,868
Hey, you know what I think we
should do?

695
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:50,453
We should go shopping.

696
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:53,206
Might as well have a little fun
while we're on this trip, right?

697
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,917
I don't know.

698
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,293
She loves buying stuff.

699
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,133
All right, y'all.
What do you think?

700
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,011
Well, well, well.
Just like Miss America.

701
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,973
Can we go now?

702
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:11,432
I'm gonna buy that for you.

703
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,435
- We need that money.
- I got plenty.

704
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:17,271
I'm gonna go pick out
some things for the kids.

705
00:55:25,698 --> 00:55:27,323
Oh, yeah.

706
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:32,286
I hate dresses.

707
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,871
You two look adorable.

708
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:36,499
You look nice.

709
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,060
You know, I'm usually a pretty
good judge of character.

710
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:59,397
But I'm gonna admit
I read y'all wrong.

711
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:03,109
I thought you were gonna
be greedy and selfish

712
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:05,570
like most of the men
I've been with.

713
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:10,324
But you ain't
and I like you.

714
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,327
Yeah? Well,
I like you too.

715
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:18,249
You know, my mama
always said,

716
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:23,254
"Don't waste time waiting
for the perfect man because,

717
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:27,008
well, life is too
goddamned short."

718
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:29,343
That's what she said?

719
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,902
Wish I could just
run away, don't you?

720
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,281
I don't know.

721
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:53,951
There's nowhere
to really run off to.

722
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:57,955
Where would you even go?

723
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:01,542
Ever been to the beach?

724
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:04,462
Never really had a chance to.

725
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,380
That's where I'd go.

726
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,299
Somewhere with a beach.

727
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:11,302
You could always come
to the beach with me and,

728
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:14,305
you know, we could have
our sandcastle house.

729
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:18,142
Go fishing.
We'd survive on fish.

730
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,562
Could be a lot worse.

731
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,315
If you could, if there
was any place on Earth

732
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,901
you could run away to,
where'd you run?

733
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:30,196
If I had to choose?

734
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,617
I'd probably go home.

735
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:38,412
Pretty exciting, right?

736
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,832
Is that in New Mexico?

737
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,461
I don't know.

738
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:27,461
Well, come on.

739
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:29,922
Tell me something
about yourself.

740
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,549
Well, there's not
much to tell.

741
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:33,509
I don't much like
talking about myself.

742
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:35,261
It's not easy for me.

743
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:38,848
Fine.
What about the boy?

744
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:40,808
His mother died.

745
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,480
And?

746
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,816
I'm taking him to live
with his grandparents.

747
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:52,236
Well, why go through
all that trouble?

748
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,655
Well, because
he's a good kid.

749
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,616
I don't mind
spending time with him.

750
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,784
Uh-huh.

751
00:58:58,911 --> 00:59:00,536
What's in it for you?

752
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:06,375
There ain't nothing
in it for me.

753
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:10,004
You're lying.

754
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,672
You're a liar.

755
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,385
Is he yours?

756
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,063
Look at you.

757
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,875
I ain't no fucking liar.

758
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:02,556
You're way better.
I'm not even making...

759
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,058
Snap, snap, clap.

760
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:05,768
I can't snap.

761
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:13,526
Hey, you know we're not far
from my grandparents' house.

762
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,690
My mom said it snows there.

763
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,570
I've never seen snow.

764
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,739
- Really?
- Yeah.

765
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,575
You should come.

766
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:24,245
I mean, you know,
if you wanted.

767
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,579
It'd be cool.

768
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:29,041
Yeah. Sounds fun.

769
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:30,584
Yeah.

770
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,181
Yeah?

771
01:00:44,308 --> 01:00:46,600
Hey, let me talk to George.
It's John.

772
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:48,602
John?

773
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,895
How's the head?

774
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:52,189
Oh, just fine.
How's your sister?

775
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:01,365
Hey, John.
Any luck in finding my money?

776
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,200
I've got the rest
of your $10,000.

777
01:01:03,327 --> 01:01:05,202
So you're 10 short.

778
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:07,496
How about this?
I bring you what I have.

779
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:09,165
Or you can come
looking for the rest.

780
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:13,627
Maybe I'll go and look
for it in New Mexico.

781
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,172
Farmington, New Mexico.

782
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:18,924
Maybe I'll find
my money over there.

783
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:21,344
I don't know what
you're talking about.

784
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,512
Of course you don't.

785
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:26,015
$20,000, John.

786
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:28,851
See you soon.

787
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:54,001
Our hometown ain't
far from here.

788
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,961
Y'all can stay with us
if you want.

789
01:01:56,088 --> 01:01:58,005
Oh, yeah? How long?

790
01:01:59,674 --> 01:02:01,467
As long as you want.

791
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,179
Yeah, I don't know about that.

792
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:08,682
I think that this little thing

793
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,434
has probably run its course.

794
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,437
So we should
probably get going.

795
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:15,898
Wow.

796
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:20,694
Well, fuck you, John.

797
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:24,657
Well, I think we've already
done that, haven't we?

798
01:02:29,204 --> 01:02:30,788
Louis.

799
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:33,374
John tell you why
he's taking you home?

800
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:35,060
Yeah, he's taking me
to my grandparents.

801
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,086
No, baby.
Did he tell you why?

802
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:39,004
I think you should probably
quit while you're ahead.

803
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:43,634
Well, I think I'd like
to fill in the blanks, okay?

804
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,429
John strikes me as
the type of guy who's failed

805
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:47,847
at just about everything
he's ever done.

806
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,473
Am I right?

807
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,852
You always had luck with
the ladies, didn't you?

808
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:55,479
But that never lasted

809
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,731
and somewhere along the way,
all those big plans,

810
01:02:57,816 --> 01:03:01,402
well, they fell apart
and you got desperate.

811
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:03,863
A little lonely.

812
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,781
That's why the idea
of dragging him around,

813
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:08,451
well, wasn't so bad,
was it?

814
01:03:08,577 --> 01:03:09,869
Mom...

815
01:03:09,995 --> 01:03:13,873
Don't worry, honey.
He ain't like us.

816
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:17,918
Men like him don't have the balls
to survive in the real world.

817
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,503
All right, listen, lady...

818
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:23,048
But the one who's got
the most to lose is you.

819
01:03:23,175 --> 01:03:25,759
Do you even know
who he is, honey?

820
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,803
'Cause he's using you.

821
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:32,766
Just like he used me.

822
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,690
Just like he
uses everybody.

823
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,984
This is bullshit.

824
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:51,118
They always run.

825
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:10,930
John?

826
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:12,598
- John?
- Get back inside, Louis!

827
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:15,809
John, let's just leave.
We can find another ride.

828
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:18,854
Louis, get back inside.

829
01:04:23,235 --> 01:04:25,694
John, she doesn't
know anything about you.

830
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,072
She's right, Louis.
I am afraid.

831
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:32,826
And I just can't take living
like everyone else, you know?

832
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:36,121
The problem is, there's
certain things about me

833
01:04:36,248 --> 01:04:37,998
that I just can't
seem to change.

834
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:41,627
John.
John, stop.

835
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:43,379
John!

836
01:04:59,145 --> 01:05:00,813
I knew there was
something wrong with him.

837
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,190
Come on, Louis.
We're gonna take you home.

838
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,859
It's not gonna
end well, honey.

839
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:09,863
Come on, get in.

840
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,532
Come on, it's okay.

841
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:24,878
Louis! What are you doing?

842
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:32,386
Get over!

843
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:33,887
Get down!

844
01:05:40,895 --> 01:05:43,022
God damn it!

845
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:46,442
God damn it!

846
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:49,194
This is a lot of money.

847
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:51,947
We could fly to Farmington
if we wanted.

848
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,213
You know what she said
about you wasn't true.

849
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:12,843
I don't know, she split me
wide open, didn't she?

850
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,846
You know, when I was in jail,

851
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:17,306
everyone wanted
to blame everyone else

852
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,850
for who they
turned out to be.

853
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:23,562
Mom, dad, girlfriend, wife.

854
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:28,942
I made a lot
of mistakes in my life.

855
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:34,406
But they were my mistakes,
nobody else's.

856
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:38,202
They're mine.

857
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:39,870
You know, when you
get older, Louis,

858
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:44,500
all those mistakes start
piling up inside you.

859
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:47,002
Just a pile of mistakes.

860
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,548
Regrets, blame.

861
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:57,846
It's enough to make you
feel sick to your stomach.

862
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:02,976
Secrets make me
feel like that.

863
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:05,813
Yeah, secrets, too.

864
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:11,235
You got many secrets?

865
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:14,321
Yeah, plenty.

866
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,989
How about you?

867
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:20,869
Yeah.

868
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,538
I like that girl.

869
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:23,997
Shit, that ain't no secret.

870
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,420
Yeah.

871
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,009
Tell me one
of your secrets.

872
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:43,016
Maybe some other time.

873
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,027
John?

874
01:08:45,705 --> 01:08:47,414
John?

875
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:54,421
John?

876
01:09:08,186 --> 01:09:09,561
Hey!

877
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:15,859
Look at that.

878
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:41,134
Hey, we need some
food for the road.

879
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:44,429
All right.
I'm gonna go grab some gas.

880
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:46,056
Let's meet back
here in ten minutes.

881
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,141
All right,
you go first.

882
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:56,149
Watch out.

883
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:03,198
Go on!

884
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:12,833
Our APO here is 96309.

885
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:15,419
So drop us a line,
anytime, APO 96309

886
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:16,420
and we'll get it on.

887
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:17,671
Anything else?

888
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,548
Oh, that's it.
Thanks.

889
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:21,758
This is the 11:00 report
featuring John Marks

890
01:10:21,885 --> 01:10:23,635
with the news and sports.

891
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:26,138
A brazen daytime robbery
of the Alpine Savings Bank

892
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,432
has state police looking
for an unidentified man

893
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:30,475
and his teenage accomplice.

894
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:34,187
They were last seen traveling
west on Farm Road 369

895
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:39,192
in a tan station wagon with
Texas license plates 74EJQ8.

896
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:45,908
Are we going to jail?

897
01:10:46,034 --> 01:10:47,993
Nah, we ain't
going to jail.

898
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:52,539
You scared?

899
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,207
No.

900
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:58,170
I'm scared.

901
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:03,550
What are we gonna do?

902
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:05,385
I don't know.

903
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:11,099
Oh, what a mess.

904
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,563
We should go to Mexico.

905
01:11:18,316 --> 01:11:21,401
We could live there for
years with all this money.

906
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:25,155
We should get a car, but...

907
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,949
we could do that.

908
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:30,369
- Give me a rock.
- Oh, I got it.

909
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:13,954
I liked the
station wagon better.

910
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:18,291
Yeah, well, nobody's gonna
be missing this piece of shit.

911
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:20,293
I can tell you that much.

912
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:24,214
Be nice if we could
this thing up over 50.

913
01:12:24,298 --> 01:12:26,258
I figure we'll drive
about halfway there

914
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,510
then find a quiet place
to camp for the night.

915
01:12:30,596 --> 01:12:32,305
What's it gonna be like?

916
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:35,434
What?
Your grandparents' place?

917
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:37,978
Yep.

918
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:40,647
I don't know.

919
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:42,983
I imagine it'll be beautiful.

920
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:50,407
Think we'll be there tomorrow?

921
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:54,119
Oh, yeah.
We should be there by lunch.

922
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:59,332
First we have to make it
through the desert.

923
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:03,962
Then we'll cross
into the mountains.

924
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:11,261
We'll know we're getting close
when we can see the farmlands.

925
01:13:11,345 --> 01:13:15,140
Green, as far as
the eye can see.

926
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:23,315
Just like
that picture?

927
01:13:25,026 --> 01:13:28,361
Yeah, just like
the picture.

928
01:14:36,806 --> 01:14:40,433
Let me get that for you.

929
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,482
There you go.

930
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:55,115
You're looking
good there, partner.

931
01:14:55,241 --> 01:14:56,616
I want to make
a good impression, you know?

932
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:58,451
Let's go.

933
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,020
Fill it up, will you?

934
01:15:37,783 --> 01:15:40,869
- Morning.
- Good morning.

935
01:16:04,602 --> 01:16:07,520
He almost
finished out there?

936
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:08,855
Yeah, almost.

937
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:19,950
9-1-1.
What's your emergency?

938
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:24,454
Hello?

939
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,706
What's the address
of your emergency?

940
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:31,586
That'll be it.

941
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:34,547
Okay, it's $20 on pump, $24.

942
01:16:34,548 --> 01:16:36,800
$24. That's a steal.

943
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,557
You have a good day.

944
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:53,566
Boy?

945
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:02,742
You're the one
from the paper.

946
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:07,372
I think you got me confused
with somebody else, all right?

947
01:17:07,498 --> 01:17:09,582
No. I know who you are.

948
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,960
I know who he is too.

949
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:31,146
The truth, sir...

950
01:17:37,528 --> 01:17:40,613
The truth is,
he's my son

951
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:43,616
and all I've ever done
is disappoint him.

952
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:49,289
I've abandoned him.

953
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:52,417
I've lied to him.

954
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:55,211
I found every
excuse that I can

955
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:58,631
just to make him another
mistake in my life.

956
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:02,635
A secret that
I keep to myself.

957
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,641
But he won't let me.

958
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:12,812
Please, just
let me make it right.

959
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:17,275
Just please
let me make it right.

960
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,911
Come on.
Grab your bag!

961
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:30,663
Don't you hear that?

962
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:34,209
Do you remember
the address?

963
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:35,585
What?

964
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:37,337
Do you remember
what the place looks like?

965
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:39,672
Do you remember the address?

966
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:43,218
What's going on?

967
01:18:43,344 --> 01:18:45,929
All right, I need
you to leave.

968
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:47,430
I'm not leaving you.

969
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:49,682
I promised this guy
in there I wouldn't run

970
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:51,851
'cause I can't run anymore.

971
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:58,691
I see myself as a person
that I'm supposed to be.

972
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:02,237
A good person, the kind
of person that you deserve.

973
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:04,239
I just...

974
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:05,573
I don't have the courage
to be that person.

975
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:06,783
I don't have the courage
to change.

976
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,701
Do you understand
what I'm trying to say?

977
01:19:08,786 --> 01:19:10,995
Here, take this with you.

978
01:19:11,122 --> 01:19:14,499
Take it with you, and go.

979
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:16,585
I need you to go, all right?
You're gonna be okay.

980
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,795
Hey, you're gonna
be all right.

981
01:19:18,921 --> 01:19:20,713
Now go, go, go, go.

982
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:23,299
I don't want to leave, John.
I don't want to leave you.

983
01:19:23,426 --> 01:19:26,386
You gotta go. Go.

984
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:27,387
I don't want to leave you, John.

985
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:29,180
Go! Run, god damn it!

986
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:30,849
Run!

987
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:48,616
Face the car!
Hands in the air!

988
01:21:47,361 --> 01:21:52,115
What do you think it's going to be like?

989
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:54,450
I'd imagine it'd be beautiful.

990
01:21:56,579 --> 01:21:59,330
Surrounded by farmland as
far as the eye can see.

991
01:22:01,959 --> 01:22:04,877
Just like that picture?

992
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:09,132
Yeah, just like
the picture.

993
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:40,455
We're going to do
a quick line inspection here

994
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:42,624
in Farmington, New Mexico.

995
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:44,167
Line number seven.

996
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:59,385
You lost?

997
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:09,020
I need to get
to Farmington.

998
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:12,732
You are lost.

999
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:14,150
I'm not lost.

1000
01:25:14,276 --> 01:25:17,069
Oh, whatever you say.

1001
01:25:17,154 --> 01:25:20,865
Yeah, you're close.

1002
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:26,704
It's up that road about
an hour or so.

1003
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:30,082
An hour?

1004
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:33,836
Yeah,
at least an hour.

1005
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,214
But you're young.

1006
01:25:43,096 --> 01:25:46,182
You could give me a ride.

1007
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:49,101
I could, yeah.

1008
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:56,025
I'd be a lot more willing if
we was to bargain for it.

1009
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:58,361
Kid with that kind of
silver ain't gonna have

1010
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:01,739
a hard time finding
a ride home.

1011
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:07,370
How about it, kid?

1012
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:23,469
23 Farm Road. 23 Farm Road.

1013
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:49,221
Louis?

1014
01:27:49,222 --> 01:27:50,723
Hey, Grandma.

1015
01:27:50,849 --> 01:27:53,225
Oh, thank you, Lord!

1016
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:56,896
Oh, we thought
we'd lost you forever!

1017
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:03,194
You were supposed
to be here days ago.

1018
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:05,237
Just look at you.

1019
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:07,573
How'd you get here?

1020
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,241
I walked.

1021
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:10,785
Oh, Lord.

1022
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:13,621
Well, come on in the house.

1023
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:15,790
Where'd you start from?

1024
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:17,917
What do you mean,
you walked?

1025
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:32,264
How do you boys
get so dirty?

1026
01:28:34,267 --> 01:28:37,269
It's good to have
you home, sweetheart.

1027
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:41,273
I want this to feel
like home, okay?

1028
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:56,414
This was your mother's room.

1029
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:04,171
I kept so many of 'em.

1030
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:09,093
I hope they
don't make you sad.

1031
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:11,303
I like looking at 'em.

1032
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:16,684
Makes me feel like
she's still here.

1033
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:22,648
You were born in this bed.
This exact one.

1034
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:25,484
Really?

1035
01:29:29,823 --> 01:29:31,574
See?

1036
01:29:31,700 --> 01:29:34,869
There's your mom and
your dad holding you.

1037
01:29:36,538 --> 01:29:38,914
You were just
a few months old.

1038
01:29:40,751 --> 01:29:44,462
Oh, you've grown
so much since then.

1039
01:29:47,549 --> 01:29:49,341
Oh, my sweet boy.
