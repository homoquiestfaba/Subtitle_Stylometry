00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:32,463
I buy good companies,

1063
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:36,434
and I make them
fantastic companies.

1064
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:40,906
My father lets me buy
one company every two years.

1065
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:42,440
I pick it.

1066
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:43,875
I buy it.

1067
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:45,643
I turn it around.

1068
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,613
Let's see what I can do.
Three companies so far.

1069
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:52,818
First and third, big successes.
Big.

1070
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:55,453
Middle one was difficult,
because

1071
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,689
I started to build a house,
right,

1072
00:45:58,824 --> 00:46:02,493
and a lot of little details.

1073
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,529
A lot of tiny decisions to make.

1074
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:09,667
In the middle of it,
my contractor went bankrupt.

1075
00:46:09,734 --> 00:46:12,070
It's a crazy story.

1076
00:46:12,137 --> 00:46:14,272
The house came out great,
two swimming pools.

1077
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:15,974
Wonderful. In Montecito.
Gorgeous.

1078
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:18,376
It sounds like it's stunning.

1079
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,246
I know, and I couldn't
enjoy it for a while,

1080
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:24,015
because the company...

1081
00:46:24,082 --> 00:46:25,851
and a lot of people
lost their jobs.

1082
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:29,587
It was a family owned company,
not unlike... and...

1083
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:30,855
But you know what?
You live and learn.

1084
00:46:30,856 --> 00:46:32,390
And I'll never touch
textiles again.

1085
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:34,325
Anyway, look, that's done.

1086
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:38,563
My vision for this company
is big.

1087
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,566
I ask you,
how big is your vision?

1088
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,401
Triple it!

1089
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:47,305
You folks make so many sales
a year, like, X sales.

1090
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:52,210
Well, imagine 3X sales!

1091
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:54,012
There's nothing we can't do!

1092
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,981
We work hard.

1093
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:57,448
We work harder.

1094
00:46:57,515 --> 00:47:01,252
Till we are as hard as a rock.

1095
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,721
Tonight we celebrate
our new strength.

1096
00:47:03,788 --> 00:47:05,756
Tonight is champagne.
Tonight is caviar.

1097
00:47:05,891 --> 00:47:08,559
Tonight is coke
off each other's tits.

1098
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:10,361
Questions.

1099
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:13,064
Sir.
- Are we gonna have new emails?

1100
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:15,500
We are.
[indistinct muttering]

1101
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:16,901
Yes.

1102
00:47:16,902 --> 00:47:18,904
Are we gonna have access
to the old emails?

1103
00:47:18,937 --> 00:47:21,572
'Cause, you know,
I reference those with clients.

1104
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:22,950
That's wonderful.
That's a follow-up,

1105
00:47:22,974 --> 00:47:24,609
and we thank you for that.

1106
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,112
That's a question for IT.
- Okay.

1107
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:30,548
But if that functionality is
available, you will have it.

1108
00:47:30,615 --> 00:47:32,017
Yes.

1109
00:47:32,083 --> 00:47:34,119
Yellow dress.
- Oh, thank you.

1110
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,521
I've had it since college.

1111
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,789
With the email address,
will we be able

1112
00:47:38,924 --> 00:47:42,460
to forward from our old
email address

1113
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:44,495
to our new email address or...

1114
00:47:45,964 --> 00:47:47,232
Attention, everybody.

1115
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:49,434
This is not just
a simple work function.

1116
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,436
It's also a birthday party.

1117
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:55,640
All: Happy birthday!

1118
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,018
What are you... what are
you... what are you doing?

1119
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:58,685
I wanted to have a
little surprise for you.

1120
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:00,545
Party inside a party.
Are you surprised?

1121
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:02,380
Yes, dear, I am very surprised.

1122
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:04,682
- Good.
- Thank you.

1123
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:05,984
I didn't get her anything.

1124
00:48:06,051 --> 00:48:07,571
All that matters
is that you're here.

1125
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:08,786
Got you that.

1126
00:48:08,853 --> 00:48:10,064
Winston,
we said no gifts this year.

1127
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:12,357
I'm sorry.
My passion for you, it's...

1128
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:14,525
- Come here for a second.
- I had to.

1129
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:17,362
She's meeting me here.

1130
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:18,829
She's gorgeous.

1131
00:48:18,964 --> 00:48:20,765
- Yes.
- Oh, it's magnificent.

1132
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:24,769
You said I'm up or down
for anything or anyone.

1133
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:27,105
Yeah, I needed results, so...

1134
00:48:27,172 --> 00:48:28,506
Why up or down?

1135
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,441
Well, I forgot
which way was more fun.

1136
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:32,677
- Thank you.
- I guess they both work.

1137
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,345
I hope you like it.

1138
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,114
Oh. Oh.

1139
00:48:36,181 --> 00:48:37,983
Oh, my God.

1140
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:39,626
Hopefully, this spices
things up for you guys.

1141
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,219
- Wow.
- I have a cousin

1142
00:48:41,286 --> 00:48:43,221
in the nightgown business,

1143
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:46,424
and this is a typical lattice.

1144
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:48,093
Do you mind displaying it
on your body?

1145
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:49,360
- On my body?
- Yeah.

1146
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:50,361
You don't have to...
You don't have to.

1147
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:52,130
Absolutely.
Don't worry.

1148
00:48:52,197 --> 00:48:54,365
I'm happily married, so just...

1149
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,401
It looks so breathable.

1150
00:48:56,467 --> 00:48:58,269
And red is Bill's
favorite color.

1151
00:48:58,336 --> 00:49:01,139
That's wonderful.

1152
00:49:01,206 --> 00:49:02,773
[sighs]

1153
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:06,011
Bill's the man she hopes will
contribute semen to our quest

1154
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:08,846
for a child,
because I have a lot of semen,

1155
00:49:08,913 --> 00:49:10,348
but it doesn't...
- We know.

1156
00:49:10,415 --> 00:49:11,816
- Retain much sperm.
- We know.

1157
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:14,019
- Wow. What's next?
- I just need you for a second.

1158
00:49:14,052 --> 00:49:15,662
Thanks so much.
- Just... just... just give us...

1159
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:17,122
Give us a second.
- Real quick.

1160
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:19,624
What... wait.
What are you doing?

1161
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,827
- I'm going shopping.
- No.

1162
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,263
[glass dinging]
- Hi.

1163
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:26,797
Sorry to interrupt.

1164
00:49:26,864 --> 00:49:29,800
We're your neighbors
from next door.

1165
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:32,370
And this is my friend Neal.

1166
00:49:32,437 --> 00:49:34,939
We met at Princeton,
where he was

1167
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:39,810
the valedictorian
and an incredible poet

1168
00:49:39,877 --> 00:49:43,614
and perhaps has something
beautiful to share

1169
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:46,284
on the topic of retirement.

1170
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:47,485
Yeah.

1171
00:49:57,628 --> 00:49:59,164
So happy you're retiring.

1172
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:02,233
You know, I hope you find
a new passion.

1173
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,303
Painting. You know?

1174
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,472
Go to a rec center.

1175
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:08,673
Look at me.
Look at my hands.

1176
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:12,410
Look at my hands.

1177
00:50:12,477 --> 00:50:14,412
Like a bird.

1178
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:15,880
Ohh.

1179
00:50:15,946 --> 00:50:18,683
[gasps]
Oh, my gosh, a massage?

1180
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:21,286
Yes.
Yes, yes, I certainly will.

1181
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,720
Thank you.

1182
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:25,490
Chuck brings his table
right to your bouse.

1183
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:26,967
Really?
He'll bring it to my house?

1184
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:28,359
- Yes.
- That's so nice.

1185
00:50:28,426 --> 00:50:30,361
Chuck just goes up and down.

1186
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:31,529
You'll feel relaxed.

1187
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:33,498
You'll escape your reality.

1188
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:35,133
Oh, my... and how
do you know Chuck?

1189
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,269
I'm Chuck.

1190
00:50:38,336 --> 00:50:39,437
Right?
- Oh, my gosh.

1191
00:50:39,504 --> 00:50:41,172
Yeah.
That's my masseuse name.

1192
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:42,616
- Thank you, Kyle.
- You're welcome.

1193
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,209
Thank you very much.

1194
00:50:44,275 --> 00:50:45,486
I'd be happy
to give you a massage

1195
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:46,977
if you want a massage.

1196
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:50,948
Happy birthday.

1197
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:53,251
- Oh, Eliza. Really?
- Thank you.

1198
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:54,785
I did feel like I had to.

1199
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:56,130
This paper's so pretty.
Thank you.

1200
00:50:56,154 --> 00:50:58,556
I know you the like
the color, so...

1201
00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:00,358
You didn't have to
get me anything.

1202
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:02,160
This is...

1203
00:51:02,227 --> 00:51:04,262
- Oh, tea kettle.
- Oh, my gosh, a tea kettle.

1204
00:51:04,329 --> 00:51:07,398
Eliza!

1205
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:08,866
That's perfect for you.

1206
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:11,602
That is very thoughtful, Eliza.

1207
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:12,903
Thank you.

1208
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:14,872
Yep, I thought it out,
and I realized

1209
00:51:14,939 --> 00:51:16,217
that's what you need most,
right?

1210
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:17,575
Yeah.
You did not have to

1211
00:51:17,642 --> 00:51:19,844
get me a thing, truly.

1212
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,812
Ding-dong. Final gift.
Best for last.

1213
00:51:21,879 --> 00:51:23,714
Happy birthday, Margie.
- Oh.

1214
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,750
- Here you go.
- Oh!

1215
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:29,420
What a lovely pot, Mark.

1216
00:51:29,487 --> 00:51:32,190
Open it.

1217
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:34,159
Okay.

1218
00:51:34,225 --> 00:51:35,860
Uh-oh.
- It's coq au vin.

1219
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:36,927
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1220
00:51:36,994 --> 00:51:38,429
It's my recipe right there.

1221
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:40,030
Pretty rude, actually,

1222
00:51:40,165 --> 00:51:41,499
to bring dinner
to a dinner party.

1223
00:51:41,566 --> 00:51:42,700
That's rude, Mark.

1224
00:51:42,767 --> 00:51:44,034
We talked so much about it.

1225
00:51:44,169 --> 00:51:47,071
I just wanted to show
you my recipe, and...

1226
00:51:47,172 --> 00:51:48,873
- It smells great.
- Wow.

1227
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,841
- Happy birthday.
- That is very thoughtful.

1228
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:53,944
Absolutely.

1229
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:57,548
You should eat it.

1230
00:51:57,615 --> 00:51:59,217
I certainly couldn't.

1231
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:00,651
No.

1232
00:52:00,718 --> 00:52:02,820
Give it a taste.

1233
00:52:02,887 --> 00:52:06,324
- Dear...
- Hmm?

1234
00:52:06,391 --> 00:52:08,025
Please try it, Margie.

1235
