1
00:00:19,452 --> 00:00:21,477
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

2
00:00:21,554 --> 00:00:26,582
<i>Who caused this child
to walk on her own</i>

3
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,926
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

4
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:35,559
<i>Who leads her down
this treacherous road</i>

5
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:40,101
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

6
00:00:40,173 --> 00:00:45,167
<i>She's dancing to
a song we can't hear</i>

7
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,807
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

8
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:12,236
I think one of the reasons
I live in New York is 'cause..

9
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,500
I know my way
around New York.

10
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,008
I don't know
my way around Paris.

11
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,944
I, uh...

12
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:24,313
don't know
my way around Denver.

13
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:27,148
I don't know
my way around Maui.

14
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,620
I don't know my way
around Toronto, etcetera.

15
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,214
So, it's almost by default.

16
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:35,227
I don't know very many people
who live in New York...

17
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:38,560
who don't also say,
"But I'm leaving."

18
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:43,500
And I've been thinking
of leaving...

19
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,505
for, uh, 35 years now.

20
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,507
I'm almost ready.

21
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,930
<i>Last summer there
was a stretch of a couple of weeks...</i>

22
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:16,457
<i>where everywhere I turned
everyone seemed to be going nuts.</i>

23
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:21,837
<i>I mean, it's crazy enough
living in Brooklyn in the first place.</i>

24
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:26,607
<i>But, so many weird little things
kept popping up at once.</i>

25
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,648
<i>They all kinda got scrambled
together in my head.</i>

26
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:33,709
<i>I doubt that any of it
makes sense anymore...</i>

27
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:37,654
<i>but... this is how I remember it.</i>

28
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:47,960
- You got it?
- I got it.

29
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:52,130
Remember, okay?
Saturday the sixteenth.

30
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,332
- Saturday the sixteenth?
- Yes.

31
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:59,344
- Saturday the sixteenth?
- Saturday the sixteenth.

32
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:02,643
It has to be that night.
It's got to be because it's the only night...

33
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:06,276
that Ramon and his band
are playing in Brooklyn. Okay?

34
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,617
Auggie, he's my brother.
Trust me, okay?

35
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:14,058
- Don't worry, sweetheart. It's a date.
- Trust me.

36
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,789
Thank you. Listen. Listen.

37
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,297
You're going to be so special.

38
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,892
Just remember the steps
I teach you. Okay?

39
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:27,030
And you're going to be
like Fred "Fucking" Astaire.

40
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:29,836
- Okay, Ginger. Whatever you say.
- Hey! Thief!

41
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,377
He took my bag! Hey!

42
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:40,918
He got your purse.

43
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,182
- Thank you very much, sir.
- You okay?

44
00:03:43,256 --> 00:03:45,952
- I really appreciate that. Yeah. Thank you.
- All right. Good.

45
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,653
- That was great.
- All right.

46
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:54,356
Let's go call the cops,
have this little kid arrested.

47
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,368
- Come on.
- Wait a second.

48
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,370
We'll call from inside the store.

49
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:01,305
You're gonna
have him arrested?

50
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:03,308
Yeah.

51
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,742
- No. No. No! Don't!
- How old are you?

52
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:13,081
I see it in your eyes.
Me? I'm only... 12.

53
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,518
- Come on, he's...
- Is that what you're gonna give me now, lady?

54
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,522
No. He's scared
to death. Come on.

55
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,286
I'm scared to death of him.

56
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,794
- You caught him in about five seconds flat.
- I'm only 12 years old...

57
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,956
and I only shoot people
who can't catch me, who are too old...

58
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,592
- Come on. Come on.
- Lady. Lady!

59
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:32,661
Mister, come on. I thank you for getting
it back, but let him go. He's too little.

60
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,037
- You're not gonna press charges against him?
- No.

61
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,076
- You're not gonna press charges against him?
- No. Look at him.

62
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:40,408
- Look at him? What about him?
- He's a baby. He looks like my little brother.

63
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,244
Sweetheart, babies are shooting people
in New York today.

64
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,251
- Do you see a gun on him? Come on.
- Do you read the papers?

65
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,879
- You got a gun on you?
- You're kidding me. Let him go, all right?

66
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,049
- Bye, bye. That's it.
- This is a joke already. Let him go.

67
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,423
- Stop it. Leave him alone, please!
- That's enough.

68
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,894
- Let's call the cops.
- Just let him go. All right?

69
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,295
I don't care. I don't want to
press charges. Thank you.

70
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:03,324
I do appreciate getting my purse back,
but please let him go.

71
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,701
- He's gonna be good. Look at him.
- Uh-huh.

72
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,172
You're not gonna do
anything anymore.

73
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,873
- Here, it's yours. It's yours.
- You're looking for trouble.

74
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:18,007
- You're looking for trouble.
- Go! Go!

75
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:27,215
- What are you doing?
- Why'd you do that?

76
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:31,252
You shit! Look at the poor girl.
Why you do that, you fuck?

77
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,892
Why you stand there?
Do something! You think it's funny.

78
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:38,266
- It's not funny. I'm not laughing.
- How dare you do that!

79
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,068
How dare you take my thing
and give it away like that.

80
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,971
- Do you know what is in there?
- Lady...

81
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:45,010
- Shut up!
- Lady?

82
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:48,445
- What are you doing? Are you some kind of vigilante?
- If that bag is important to you...

83
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,414
then hang onto it.

84
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,577
- I put my life at risk to catch that kid.
- Thank you, but I have a right...

85
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,588
- to forgive somebody and not be punished for it.
- No. You've got a respon...

86
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:00,183
- Excuse me, sweetheart. Give me a minute.
- Don't talk to me like that, Auggie.

87
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:03,456
- You've got a responsibility to teach that kid...
- Don't stick that in my face!

88
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,463
- You have no right.
- Oh, lady.

89
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,160
- Lady! Lady! What is this?
- You've got a responsibility to teach this kid right from wrong.

90
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,897
You just taught him right from wrong?
That was right from wrong?

91
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:14,201
- You just rewarded him!
- You know what you taught him?

92
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:17,674
- I rewarded him? Mama!
- You gave it back to him.

93
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,871
- Oh, God! Please!
- Come on, stop it!

94
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,608
- I rewarded him?
- You just gave it back. What a lesson was that?

95
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:27,710
- It was encouragement. Mine was a lesson of clemency.
- Clemency? Lady!

96
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,381
- I showed him a little bit of kindness.
- This is New York!

97
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:33,124
I'm scared in my own apartment.

98
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:35,456
I'm, I'm... You know.

99
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:39,658
I'm scared 24 hours a day,
but not necessarily in New York.

100
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:43,168
I actually feel
pretty comfortable in New York.

101
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,728
I get scared
like in Sweden.

102
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:50,902
You know, it's kind of empty.
They're all drunk.

103
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,309
Everything works.

104
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,338
If you, you know... If you stop at a stop
light and don't turn your engine off...

105
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,817
people come over
and talk to you about it.

106
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:03,253
You open the medicine cabinet
and there'll be a poster saying...

107
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:06,189
"In case of suicide, call..."

108
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,717
You turn on the TV,
there's an ear operation.

109
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:13,562
These things scare me.
New York, no.

110
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:18,332
There are 2.3 million people
living in Brooklyn.

111
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,396
There are 90 different
ethnic groups...

112
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,704
32,000 businesses...

113
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:29,305
and 1,500 churches, synagogues
and mosques in Brooklyn.

114
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,351
There were 30,973 robberies...

115
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,854
14,596 felonious assaults...

116
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,119
and 720 murders
committed in Brooklyn last year.

117
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,658
No problem, Vin.
Everything's under control.

118
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:46,425
- I could run this store in my sleep.
- I know.

119
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:49,696
How long you been
workin' for me, Auggie?

120
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:54,832
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years.
Something like that.

121
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,501
Kinda crazy, don't you think?
I mean, uh...

122
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:02,378
a smart guy like you, what do you want
to hold onto a dead-end job like this for?

123
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,575
I don't know.

124
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,676
Maybe because
I love you so much, boss.

125
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,389
I love you too.

126
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:23,001
<i>The Brooklynites</i>

127
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:24,627
<i>The Brooklynites, yo</i>

128
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,239
<i>Shakes you for the truth
The three, the four, the five</i>

129
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:34,211
<i>The A, 'the "C, 'the"E'
The "B-D-F'</i>

130
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,408
<i>The "N, 'the"R'
The Queens bound "G'</i>

131
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,418
<i>Won't you please stand clear
of the closin'doors</i>

132
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:42,579
<i>Won't you please
stand clear of...</i>

133
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:49,255
The Brooklyn attitude,
as far as I'm concerned, is first...

134
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,161
knowing what you're doing,
being right...

135
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:56,565
and following through and never stop
following through on what you believe in.

136
00:08:56,636 --> 00:09:00,197
And, uh, if
you have to defend it...

137
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:05,540
physically, verbally, spiritually,
whatever way you have to defend it, is...

138
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:09,377
Brooklyn people are always ready to pay
the price for what they believe in.

139
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:13,384
And, um, it's being
up front and following through...

140
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,615
and not taking
any crap from anybody.

141
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,681
Uh, a pack of Kools, please.

142
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,388
- What's she doing?
- I heard you, Dennis.

143
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:27,262
- Huh?
- I heard you, Dennis. This is a public place.

144
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,267
Yeah, it's a public place.
Whatever.

145
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:32,600
- How you doin'?
- How you doin', Dennis?

146
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,867
Oh, I'm good.
I'm always good.

147
00:09:34,941 --> 00:09:39,241
I'm glad to see
your fingers aren't broken.

148
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,406
Wha... What the...
What's that supposed to mean?

149
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:46,645
If your fingers were broken, you'd have
an excuse for not callin' Mary last night.

150
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:49,313
She sat by the phone all night.
She thought somethin' happened.

151
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:52,915
"Oh, maybe Dennis...
Maybe something happened." Fool!

152
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:57,520
If you tell her you're gonna meet her,
you come or at least call.

153
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,597
- Wha...
- Don't act like you don't know what I'm talking about.

154
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:07,571
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What are you comin' in here tellin' me...

155
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,202
- I was hopin' I'd bump into you, to be honest.
- No, let me fin...

156
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,839
What are you comin' in here, tellin' me
what to do with my girlfriend?

157
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,849
- Your girlfriend?
- I think that...

158
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,819
If you cared an ounce about Mary, you would
not let her sit there all night waiting for you.

159
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,685
Mary and I have an understanding.
See, I work for a living.

160
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:27,225
- She didn't act like she understood anything last night.
- I don't know what you do.

161
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:31,457
I know what you do. You spend ten hours
a day standing around a diner, making 25...

162
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,796
- I work for a living. I have a schedule, I have people...
- A schedule?

163
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:39,565
The Knicks game's at 8:00. That means at
7:00 you're out there with the tickets.

164
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,870
- That's a schedule?
- It's a schedule. It's a job.

165
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:46,776
- It's where I have to be. It's something she understands.
- And what is this?

166
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:51,146
What are you doin' even like deciding
wh-what she needs to think, what l...

167
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:53,151
Wh-What are you gettin'
in my shit for?

168
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,380
I don't give a shit
what you do with your life.

169
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:58,480
- Do what you like. But leave my sister...
- Then shut up about it.

170
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,355
- In one piece.
- Then shut up about it! Why you come in here...

171
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,952
- These... This place... Don't touch me.
- I don't like to see my sister...

172
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:09,866
How 'bout you don't touch me at all, okay?
Keep your greasy diner fuckin' fingers off me.

173
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,426
- What?
- You know, I had...

174
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,770
- Where do you come off?
- I spent a year listening to Phil, my good friend...

175
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,902
You know Phil. I spent a fuckin' year
listening to him bitch about you.

176
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:23,608
A year! And now you're gonna tell me
how to run my relationship?

177
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,449
- You're gonna tell me what I should do to my girlfriend, or shouldn't do?
- I'm asking...

178
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,355
I believe you come... Y-Y-You... Phil left you.
I think that was the case, right?

179
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,724
- A-Am I mistaken about that?
- I don't think that was the sequence of events.

180
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:39,026
I think he left... Well, no.
What was, then? What, you left him?

181
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:42,625
No, I don't think so.
I don't think so! No. He left you.

182
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,468
- You know why he left her? Frigid. Frigid.
- I'm glad you're an ex...

183
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,600
That's why. Frigid.
Nothin'. Nothin'! Nothin'! Nothin'!

184
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,906
- Fuck you!
- Ice bitch. Ice bitch.

185
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,673
Fuck you, you bastard!

186
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:59,047
I taught him handball, and he's my best
opponent because the score's always tied.

187
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:02,519
We don't fight at home
because we fight on the court.

188
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:05,250
I'm talkin' about drop-dead fights.
I won't give.

189
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,987
I'll die. I'll fall down on that court
before I give him a point.

190
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,325
And then he tries
to harass me on, you know.

191
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,059
He said, "Oh! Now," he said,
"I'm gonna get serious."

192
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:17,125
And every time he does that,
I kick his butt.

193
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,536
What the fuck you come in here
doin' this shit for?

194
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:23,700
These are my friends. You're telling
him how to run his business!

195
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:27,542
These are my friends. What the hell
you comin' in here tellin' my friends...

196
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,844
- Dennis, come on.
- No! Fuck you. Fuck you!

197
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,477
- All right, I'll just go out.
- Just forget about it.

198
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:37,681
- What we... What were you yelling about?
- Is that what this is about?

199
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,784
- You guys sit around here and talk all day this trash?
- Nah. No.

200
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:44,887
I'm sorry. I started it.
Believe me, I know I started it.

201
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,693
- Nobody talks about you.
- Hmm.

202
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,257
Wh-What were you
yelling about?

203
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,736
- Things we shouldn't've been yelling about.
- You want a hug?

204
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,866
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

205
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,973
Get right in there, Jimmy.

206
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,677
- Do you feel better?
- Yeah, a lot better.

207
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,747
- You're not rigid anymore?
- No, no. Not rigid.

208
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:15,851
I get rigid sometimes.

209
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,158
Yeah.

210
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,064
Like the Indian over there.

211
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:26,594
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I, I stand over there, get rigid.

212
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:28,839
Auggie says that, uh...

213
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:31,376
He says that first of all, you...

214
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,911
He says first of all,
you like somebody.

215
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,777
And, um, and then
you kiss 'em.

216
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:40,580
Then after you kiss 'em,
uh, you do the dirty.

217
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,986
Yeah. Yeah, doin' the dirty.

218
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:47,423
Yeah. He says,
and after that, uh...

219
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,121
then you find out if, uh,
you can fall in love with 'em.

220
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:53,563
And if you fall in love with 'em,
you marry somebody else.

221
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,827
Hey. Hey!

222
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:58,836
- Hey, Dot.
- Hi.

223
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,702
- How are you, kid?
- Well, I'm just great. I'm just great.

224
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:06,438
Can I have gum?
Everything's real fuckin' great.

225
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,106
What brings you
to sunny Brooklyn?

226
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,617
I just drove in. I wanted to talk to ya,
if I can talk to ya.

227
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,915
Can I talk to ya?
Do you have a minute?

228
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:18,548
- You caught me at a bad time. I'm taking inventory.
- Ooh, a minute.

229
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:22,025
A minute.
I'm so fucking pissed off!

230
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,552
Goddamn it, I'm so fucking
pissed off at Vinny. I just...

231
00:14:25,631 --> 00:14:29,533
I just wanted to talk to you about it.
I don't know why I want to talk to you about it.

232
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,661
But you know him.
I don't know.

233
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:34,865
- I don't know him.
- What happened?

234
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,000
He just drives me out of my
fuckin' mind. You know what I mean?

235
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:41,706
He promised me that he was gonna take me to
Las Vegas. You heard about that and everything.

236
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,114
Then at the last minute
of course, another time, he pulls out.

237
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:50,121
And he says, "We're gonna postpone it."
Or cancel it. Whatever the fuck he said.

238
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:54,785
- But I'm not goin'. He's not goin' with me, anyway.
- Yeah?

239
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,523
And I'm mad because
I was looking forward to it.

240
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,361
I really wanted to go.
I've been wanting to go my whole life.

241
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,425
But instead of being able to go there,
what did I do? I sat there washing dishes...

242
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:09,031
making tuna fish casserole for 15 years,
and I don't get to go to Las Vegas.

243
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,338
And I'm pissed,
and I can't get on this chair!

244
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,776
Dot, baby, he must've had
a good reason for canceling.

245
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,007
He doesn't have a good reason.
There is no good reason.

246
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,447
There's a million reasons,
but none of them are good.

247
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,748
I need to have some excitement.
I wanted to go...

248
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,517
you know, where there's things
happening at night...

249
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,650
after 6:00.

250
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:31,093
- How about your bed?
- Ha.

251
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,064
- Like I said, that's why
I want to go to Las Vegas.

252
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,567
- Come on!
- Come on? You don't know.

253
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:40,036
- So the guy, one time he broke a promise.
- It isn't one time!

254
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,199
It's every time.
It's 15 years' worth of times.

255
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,176
It's not one time. If it was one time,
do you think I'd be this upset?

256
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,544
If it was one time, I'd be like,
"Oh, that's okay. That's okay, Vinny."

257
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:53,915
But it's always.
We never do anything fun!

258
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,920
I'm a fun girl.

259
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:04,292
- Can I really talk to you? I mean, really talk to you?
- Of course, Dot.

260
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:07,560
- Well, he's a... I don't know.
- Whoa. Whoa.

261
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,227
- Hey, Violet. How are you?
- Hi, Dot.

262
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,270
- Hi.
- You know Dot. Dot, Violet.

263
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:15,034
- Yeah. Hi, Violet.
- Hi, Dot.

264
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:18,008
- What's doin', baby?
- Well, I come... You make it clearer, okay?

265
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:20,409
I come to tell you
that Saturday night...

266
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,074
you and me, chicky-chicky,
dancey-dancey, remember, okay?

267
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,915
You're goin' dancin', huh?
Well, don't cancel.

268
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,514
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, listen. Listen, just...

269
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,683
- Don't cancel, though. Don't let him cancel.
- We don't cancel.

270
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,320
- He don't cancel with me.
- Vinny doesn't cancel either. Vinny's not...

271
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,126
Don't gimme your shit. I'll see you later.

272
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,499
- All right. Be good.
- Yeah.

273
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,539
- What are you doin', gorgeous?
- How are you?

274
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,769
Nice to see you, baby.

275
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,676
So, you and I go
dancey-dancey, okay?

276
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:56,579
- Saturday night.
- Saturday night?

277
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,878
Yeah.

278
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,784
Not this Saturday night.
You mean the Saturday night after.

279
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,254
Bullshit, Auggie. Bullshit!

280
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:08,020
- Oh! What are you doin'?
- What are you doing to me?

281
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,584
Don't do that.
He's gotta sweep the floor.

282
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:15,599
Auggie, you say Saturday night. Don't bullshit
me. What kind of number you tryin' to pull?

283
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:18,363
You say the sixteenth.
We say the sixteenth, okay?

284
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,871
I planned the whole night.

285
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,499
Jesus! Is there something in the air?
What's the matter with you?

286
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:26,738
Dotty's upset.
You're upset. About what?

287
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,838
- What's in your ear?
- That's my music.

288
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,209
Listen, sweetheart.
Saturday night, um...

289
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:40,819
Saturday night
I promised Tommy...

290
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,589
I'd clean out
his brother's apartment with him.

291
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,928
His brother, um,
his brother Chuck.

292
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,733
We were... in the Navy
together, and he died.

293
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,807
- You understand?
- I don't know what you're talking about, okay?

294
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,777
Chuck. Chuck.
Who the fuck is Chuck?

295
00:18:00,846 --> 00:18:04,179
No, who the fuck was Chuck?
Chuck is dead.

296
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:07,776
Chuck's the guy
I was in the Navy with and he died.

297
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:13,120
You... are two-timing me,
ain't you, baby? Come here.

298
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,126
- Two-timing you?
- Come here. Yes.

299
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:20,097
- You're too beautiful to two-time.
- Who is it? Dot? Sally?

300
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,464
Oh, I know. I know.

301
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,868
It's the little waitress
with the fat culo, isn't it?

302
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,499
You give me more credit
than I deserve, doll.

303
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:32,373
No, no. I would never two-time you.
What's the matter with you?

304
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,744
I love you. Come on, stop. Stop.

305
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:02,470
You lied to me, Augusto.

306
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,839
And people who lie...

307
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:08,073
don't deserve no love.

308
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:12,642
You mess with Violeta.

309
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:16,176
And Violeta fight back.

310
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:31,235
I rip your guts out, Auggie...

311
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,430
like a tiger.

312
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,871
Like a fucking tiger...

313
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,932
with teeth...

314
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,117
as sharp as the razor blades.

315
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,752
Don't fuck with me.

316
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,918
L- Is a Brooklyn girl
a good fighter?

317
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:59,157
Of course. 'Cause we don't
scratch and pull hair.

318
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:03,395
We fight like guys, fist to fist.
You know what I'm sayin'?

319
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,164
And if we can't beat
the other girl, we'll use...

320
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,934
a garbage can or a bottle
or anything.

321
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:11,134
Do I have a boyfriend?
Yeah.

322
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,144
He's a roughneck, though.

323
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:17,546
But he's not like me. He don't like
lookin' at stuff and chillin' out.

324
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:23,452
He wanna go smoke weed
and drink forties all day and...

325
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:28,960
That's all he does. I mean, I think
he smokes a pound of weed a day.

326
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:34,693
He's my boyfriend, but I'm gonna change him
because he got too much Brooklyn in him.

327
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:50,581
Pack of Luckys?

328
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,743
You know what? No.

329
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,583
I'll tell you what.
I've got one cigarette left...

330
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,681
and I decided I was
gonna come here, I'm gonna quit.

331
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,226
But I wanted
to smoke this with you.

332
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:06,253
So I thought, you know,
"Last cigarette, smoke it with Auggie."

333
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,492
- In fact... Hey, Jimmy.
- You're kidding me? I'm touched.

334
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:12,560
Would you take a picture of me
and Auggie with my last cigarette?

335
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,266
- You just push this.
- Yeah.

336
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,865
- This is it, man.
- All right.

337
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,401
- Where do you want me to stand?
- I don't know.

338
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,278
- Think you could come over here?
- All right.

339
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:28,842
- Yeah. You just push this.
- This one?

340
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,354
No, this one.

341
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,914
- All right?
- Yeah.

342
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:36,790
- Bob, you know...
- The last cigarette... with Auggie.

343
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,729
I'm touched you would want
to smoke your last cigarette with me.

344
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,565
Twelve years I come in here. Luckys.
Wait, Jimmy. Your finger's in front.

345
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,070
All right.

346
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:52,076
- All right. Thanks, man.
- Good. You got it, Jimmy.

347
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,942
Good. Okay. You got it.

348
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:59,211
Thanks. So this is it.
One more cigarette.

349
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:02,811
I remember
my first cigarette, man.

350
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:07,188
These friends of mine, they stole cigarettes
from this store, Beeler's Pharmacy.

351
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,195
I still remember. It was like a suburb
of Akron, Ohio where I grew up.

352
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:15,063
So we walked home along
the railroad tracks. Opened the pack.

353
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:18,034
I still remember.
It was like a pack of Newports.

354
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:22,597
We smelled 'em first. You know,
that menthol. It smelled like candy.

355
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:26,337
Then we lit 'em up.
We started inhaling, coughing.

356
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:29,380
- A couple minutes later,
we're sick, nauseous, dizzy.

357
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,643
- But we felt so cool. You know?
- Yeah.

358
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,618
Real bad-ass
ten-year-old kids smokin'.

359
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:38,383
But sex and cigarettes, man,
you gotta admit.

360
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:42,757
- That's one thing I'm really gonna miss, having a cigarette.
- Sex?

361
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:45,626
- Well...
- You giving up sex also because you can't smoke afterwards?

362
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:49,098
Maybe, you know, if...
l- I've never had a girlfriend who didn't smoke.

363
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,261
Maybe that means if I quit,
I'll never have sex again. I don't know.

364
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:55,306
But having a cigarette
after sex, that's like...

365
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:59,140
A cigarette never tasted like that, you know?
Share a cigarette with your lover.

366
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,509
- That's bliss.
- That I'm gonna miss.

367
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,413
Also with coffee.
Coffee and cigarettes, you know?

368
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,451
That's like
breakfast of champions.

369
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:09,681
- Hey, my man. Hey.
- What's happenin'?

370
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,053
Want some coffee?

371
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:14,786
Don't get lint
on your outfit.

372
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,919
Lint? No, I hate lint.
Lint ain't no good for me.

373
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,929
- Let me ask you somethin'.
- What do you want to ask me?

374
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:22,194
I got a job interview
at 209-1/2...

375
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:26,670
See, man. Is there any nurses
livin' in the neighborhood?

376
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,104
Nurses? There's a hospital
five blocks up on the left-hand side.

377
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,699
I just came out
of the hospital.

378
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,745
You need to go back
to the hospital, get that redressed.

379
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:36,940
- No. It just got dressed.
- It don't look like it just got dressed.

380
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:41,076
- What day is this?
- Today? It's Wednesday.

381
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,087
- Wednesday.
- What are you lookin' for?

382
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:47,922
- I'm lookin' for 209-1/2...
- This is 211. 209's across the street.

383
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:49,927
- Half is in between. Right in that crack.
- You're wrong.

384
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:53,260
This is 209. 209 ain't across the street.
208 is across the street.

385
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:57,062
209's here, 211 's here. So 209-1/2
is in between these two buildings.

386
00:23:57,135 --> 00:24:00,332
I don't need no information from you.
You don't know nothin'.

387
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:03,772
This is Brooklyn. You don't go by
numbers. What are you lookin' for?

388
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:07,437
I'm lookin' for $4.95
to get a Belgian waffle.

389
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:10,242
Ah! You're lookin'
for $4.95.

390
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:13,113
- Is that a work of art or what?
- That's beautiful.

391
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,745
They don't make those anymore.
Obsolete.

392
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:19,382
You can't get that.
You better go home to mama and get that.

393
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,619
It looks pretty good actually.

394
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,277
Brooklyn has everything.

395
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:45,282
It has little, little, uh, rivers runnin'
through it. People don't know it.

396
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:48,808
It has waterfalls in it,
and they don't know where it's at.

397
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,583
And, uh, it's just fantastic.

398
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,420
It's a big, beautiful borough.
It has everything.

399
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:59,624
Flatlands, highlands,
lowlands, wooded land.

400
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,632
And even swamps.

401
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,329
When you look at the other boroughs
and compare them all...

402
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:11,035
Brooklyn is larger and is the hippest
of all of the boroughs.

403
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:12,906
I'll meet you there, then.

404
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:17,415
Check it out. I got the clocks,
the watches. I don't deal in Swatches.

405
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:20,280
Seiko, Casio, Timex, Rolex.

406
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:24,448
What do you need when you have sex?
The latex. Don't forget. How you doin', man?

407
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,083
- I got it all.
- I'll take the whole batch.

408
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,456
- You like my sales pitch?
- Not bad, man.

409
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,088
- What you sellin', my man?
- I got a good deal for you today.

410
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:35,758
- For you, Mr. Brooklyn Cigar Company...
- What've you got?

411
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:40,100
- I got $20 and $25 prices.
- Twenty and $25?

412
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,698
I've got the African price, I've got
the European price. Which one you want?

413
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:46,903
- African price or European price. Show me something nice.
- What does that mean?

414
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,811
Take a look. I'll get to
what that means in a minute.

415
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,247
I'm dealing
with the African first.

416
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,080
Black people first, always.

417
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,053
- Rolex.
- Rolex, baby. It's the real deal lizard skin.

418
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:01,081
- Where'd you get this?
- Don't you worry yourself about that, baby.

419
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,684
I got the goods.
You ain't got to worry about that.

420
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:08,096
You're gonna sell this Rolex
for 20, 25, 30, 40, 50? What is it?

421
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,999
- African price... $25.
- What does that mean, African price?

422
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,003
I'm not from Africa.

423
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:18,338
There are 872,702
African Americans.

424
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,504
412,906 Jewish people.

425
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:26,279
462,4ll Hispanic people
livin' in Brooklyn.

426
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,785
There ain't one black person
even hangin' around this neighborhood.

427
00:26:28,853 --> 00:26:33,256
- What're you doing here, man?
- My name is Tommy Fennili. That's my name.

428
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:36,294
Tommy Fennili.
Oh, yo! Tommy Fennili.

429
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:40,161
Are you from Brooklyn or somethin'?
This guy! Please, guys!

430
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:43,962
Why you hangin' out in this neighborhood?
Crown Heights, Howard Beach.

431
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,935
- We're in Brooklyn, man. Brooklyn!
- This is my neighborhood.

432
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:49,269
- West Side, do or die. That's where I'm from.
- This is my neighborhood.

433
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:52,936
- Your neighborhood. How'd you get the name Fennili?
- I'm from Italy.

434
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:55,571
- From Italy?
- My father's Italian, my mother's black.

435
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:59,708
You ain't even... What's that?
Mulatto? You ain't no mulatto.

436
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,218
- You're as black as me, man.
- Hey, hey. Come on.

437
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,619
Wait. How do you know
what I am?

438
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:06,884
- I'll tell you this, black man.
- You're assuming.

439
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,722
- I'll tell you this, black man. I'll tell you this, my brother.
- No. Wait a minute.

440
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,854
My brother Fennili,
I'll tell you this.

441
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,297
- Calm down. Get real with me. Talk to me.
- Excuse me.

442
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:19,269
- I'm gonna take a seat over here.
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

443
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,396
- He's not gonna buy one.
- Chill, chill, chill. Excuse me, sir.

444
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,169
Timex, Rolex,
Casio, Seiko.

445
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:26,904
Whatever you want,
I got it for yo.

446
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:29,037
- Yo. Come on, man. I'm tryin' to sell these.
- Hey, Vinny.

447
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,309
I'm trying to sell these
watches. The problem is...

448
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,476
I'm trying to sell these
watches 'cause I'm really a rapper.

449
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,145
That's my thing. I rap. Y'all like rap
music? You probably don't like it.

450
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,815
- You're a rapper?
- You probably ain't into rap music either.

451
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,324
I'm trying to get some equipment.
You wanna buy a watch?

452
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:45,056
- My heart is heavy with song.
- What?

453
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:49,396
<i>- I got a feeling called a blue-ue lonesome
- Oh, God.</i>

454
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:52,732
<i>- Since my baby said good-bye
- Oh, no.</i>

455
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:56,865
<i>And Lord, I don't know
what I'd do-o-o</i>

456
00:27:56,941 --> 00:28:01,241
<i>- All I do is sit and sigh-igh - Hold on.
What's up with... What're you, Puerto Ricans?</i>

457
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:05,146
You black. Playin' Billy Ray Cyrus.
What's up with this neighborhood?

458
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:09,050
- Billy Ray who?
- Y'all wanna be white. That's the problem.

459
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,214
- Playin' that... Whatever that is.
- What do you want to hear?

460
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,315
- This guy is good.
- Where're you from?

461
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,860
- Bed-Stuy.
- He doesn't know where he's from.

462
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:20,762
I was from Africa. But in case you didn't
remember, they stole us from Africa.

463
00:28:20,832 --> 00:28:22,925
- Black man Fennili.
- I got a Bed-Stuy too.

464
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,663
I stole you from Africa?
Can I give you back?

465
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:34,838
I couldn't have been
unhappier...

466
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:38,280
in the eight years I spent
growing up in Brooklyn.

467
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:40,749
But I say that, uh...

468
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,515
not having realized what it would
then be like being on Long Island...

469
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,715
which was infinitely worse.

470
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:49,920
And if there was probably
a childhood trauma that I had...

471
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,121
other than
the Dodgers leaving Brooklyn...

472
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:57,726
which if you think about it is a reason
why some of us are imbued with a cynicism...

473
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:01,533
that we never recovered from,
obviously you're not a Mets fan...

474
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,801
and you can't possibly be
a Yankee fan.

475
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,901
So baseball's eliminated
from your life...

476
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:09,378
because of being born
in Brooklyn.

477
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:13,406
- You cared about the Dodgers as a kid?
- Very much.

478
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,715
I don't know why.
I don't like baseball.

479
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,950
Of course, maybe I don't like baseball
because the Dodgers aren't here anymore.

480
00:29:19,023 --> 00:29:21,583
These days if you said the Dodgers,
no one knows what you're talking about.

481
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,925
They think you're talking about Los Angeles.
And I don't mean the Los Angeles Dodgers.

482
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:30,297
But, uh, Long Island was terrible.

483
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,302
Absolutely terrible.

484
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:35,464
I mean, at least Brooklyn
you could walk around.

485
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,531
- I'm from Brooklyn, man.
- Just relax.

486
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,770
- You got some Brooklyn tune?
- Yeah.

487
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:56,457
<i>Arriba.! Arriba.!</i>

488
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:59,861
I told you, right? Hey!

489
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,679
- Here you go.
- Yeah, man.

490
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:27,357
<i>Smoke Sen-Sen
Smoke, smoke</i>

491
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:33,154
- Let me hold it a second.
- Oh, you play?

492
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,529
- Yeah, man.
- Sells watches. Plays.

493
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,501
That's right. Gotta hustle.
Told you.

494
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:47,176
Yee-hah!

495
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,237
<i>Check it, check it Check it out
Come buy my watches</i>

496
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,807
<i>I got the clock
I got the time I got the rhyme</i>

497
00:30:53,885 --> 00:30:56,149
<i>Black man, black man
You're outta your mind</i>

498
00:30:56,221 --> 00:30:58,621
<i>Sittin' over here
on your black behind</i>

499
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,124
<i>Sittin' in the chair
White man over there</i>

500
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,456
<i>Stares at me
without a care</i>

501
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:07,464
<i>I know you don't care but
it's like... Oh, yo. Whatever, man.</i>

502
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,296
My favorite thing
about Brooklyn is...

503
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,496
that every nationality
in the world is in Brooklyn.

504
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:18,731
The least favorite thing is that
all of these nationalities...

505
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,405
we have not
been able to get along.

506
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,644
There are 3,268,121...

507
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,846
potholes in Brooklyn.

508
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:33,448
You know, I think a lot of people start
smokin' because it's glamorized...

509
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,754
like Hollywood
and the movies, you know?

510
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:41,595
You see Marlon Brando,
you see James Dean smokin' a cigarette.

511
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:45,295
- Marlene Dietrich.
- That's how I started smoking. I started smokin' 'cause...

512
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:49,636
when I was a boy, a teenager, I saw this
great movie called A Walk in the Sun.

513
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,402
- You ever see it?
- No.

514
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,876
Richard Conte, um...

515
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:56,709
Oh. Who was the other guy?
I forget his name. Anyway...

516
00:31:56,781 --> 00:32:00,148
they're on the campaign in Europe,
it's World War II and they're in the army.

517
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:04,177
Richard Conte's a machine gunner and he has
his assistant who carries bullets and all that.

518
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:08,282
Or he carries the machine gun. As they're
walkin' down the road on to the next battle...

519
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:12,352
Richard Conte would be philosophizing
about life and he'd go, "Butt."

520
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:17,231
He never had any cigarettes, and his partner
would always go... And give him a cigarette.

521
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,135
And somehow, the way Richard Conte
would be walkin' in the sun...

522
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:23,605
carryin' a machine gun
and go, "Butt,"

523
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:25,438
it made me want to smoke.

524
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,876
- I used to do it to my friends in the pool room.
- Yeah?

525
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:31,313
I go..."Butt." They go,
"Get the fuck outta here. Butt."

526
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:34,112
Speakin' of movies,
I was thinkin' too, this is unrelated...

527
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:37,916
but I was watchin' TV
the other night...

528
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,719
and in Japan and
there was some movie on.

529
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,989
Why is it in every movie
there's a shootout...

530
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,690
and when they run out
of bullets, they like "click, click."

531
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:50,530
They fling the gun away like it's
a disposable cigarette lighter.

532
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:54,264
What's up with that? Guns cost a lot
of money. Can't you reload it?

533
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:58,298
You know what I'm saying? They always
like... click. They throw the gun out.

534
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,834
- That's a good point.
- Another thing in movies I think is really weird.

535
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:04,643
Like war movies.
Nazis in movies?

536
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:09,653
- Why do they always smoke
in some weird way like this?

537
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,417
We have ways
of making you talk, Auggie.

538
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:17,223
Stop! It's like the threat of...
you know, burn torture.

539
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:19,593
Or it's like this.

540
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:23,430
Yeah. We know who you are.
We have seen what you've done.

541
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,095
The fucked up thing
is like you go to Hollywood now...

542
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,539
they got us hooked on cigarettes,
you know, this image of glamour.

543
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,940
You go out there now,
you can't smoke anywhere.

544
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,071
You light up after a meal
in a restaurant.

545
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:40,743
They come over. "I'm sorry, sir.
Smoking's prohibited by law in restaurants."

546
00:33:40,818 --> 00:33:43,252
What's up with that?
They get you started, you know?

547
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:48,154
- A butt.
- What happened to the one I just gave you?

548
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:51,252
I sent it home. They're cutting down
on the butts at home.

549
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:53,263
A butt!

550
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:57,064
A match.

551
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:01,003
Thanks.
Pays to have friends.

552
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:04,838
Yes, I'm smoking cigarettes
and many of my friends have died of it.

553
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,707
On the other hand,
while I am smoking cigarettes...

554
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:12,910
I am not downing a bottle
of Scotch... in 15 minutes.

555
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:16,112
So looked at from that point of view,
it's a health tool.

556
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,520
I can't remember the first time
I had a cigarette.

557
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,524
I can remember the first time
I had a thing...

558
00:34:21,592 --> 00:34:24,083
you would know 'cause you're from
Brooklyn, called a punk.

559
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:29,998
Do you remember a punk?
Punk was this long, green piece of wood.

560
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,799
It was a slim piece of wood,
this big, dyed green...

561
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:36,032
with God knows what
caked on it...

562
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:39,099
about three inches down
all the way to the end.

563
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,577
You lit it
and pretended to smoke it.

564
00:34:41,646 --> 00:34:44,513
Of course you couldn't inhale it
because it's solid wood.

565
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:48,712
And you'd walk around with it.
It was called a punk.

566
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:51,584
Am I right?
That I can remember.

567
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,716
When that turned into
an actual Marlboro...

568
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,818
uh, I honestly don't recall.

569
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:03,197
It's... It, along with most of my childhood
memories, are not available to me.

570
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:07,328
My childhood was so unpleasant that I
absolutely don't remember anything, I think...

571
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,431
before, uh, age 31.

572
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,782
- Tommy.
- Yeah.

573
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:27,348
Pete.

574
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,591
- Pete? Peter?
- Pete.

575
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,992
- Pe-Peter Maloney?
- Peter Maloney!

576
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:35,396
- Oh, my God! Oh, shit!
- Tommy! Tommy...

577
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,400
- Come on.
- Facimimimi.

578
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,936
- No. Uh, uh. Fennili. Fennili.
- Fuckin' who?

579
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,666
Fennili.
Tommy Fennili.

580
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,709
- You're Peter Maloney, Midwood High.
- Right.

581
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:49,177
- Double A-plus in Algebra.
- Yeah.

582
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,477
You're the guy that wiped out the curve.
How you been?

583
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:54,017
- How you been?
- Good. Good. I'm good, yeah.

584
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:56,349
I went to Harvard.
Got my B. A. At Harvard. Went to Yale.

585
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,947
Got a Ph. D. In the disciplinary studies,
philosophy and biology.

586
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:03,323
- Whoa.
- Yeah. So, what're you... This is your place?

587
00:36:03,394 --> 00:36:06,056
- Uh, yeah, it's my place. Yeah. Kinda.
- Still in the neighborhood?

588
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,792
Yeah. I love the neighborhood,
you know? Hey, wow!

589
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:11,562
- You mind if I sit down? Thanks. That's great.
- No, no, no. Sit down.

590
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,298
My glasses...

591
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:17,068
represent probably
the future of glasses...

592
00:36:17,141 --> 00:36:20,269
for a certain segment
of the population.

593
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:24,178
I've approached, uh...

594
00:36:24,248 --> 00:36:29,242
I went to the patent office first about
my glasses, and that was because...

595
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,754
Let me explain
what the glasses are.

596
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,826
The glasses
only have lenses on top.

597
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:39,351
We basically go out and we,
and we survey people at random.

598
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:44,629
And then we take their answers and funnel
them into, into a philosophy basically...

599
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,499
that'll help
improve their life.

600
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:50,598
I have... Do you want to do a survey?
Can I ask you some questions?

601
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,643
- Who, me?
- 'Cause I have a quota...

602
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,803
and you'd really
be helping me out.

603
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,315
- Right here?
- We can just... We can do it here.

604
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,715
S- Sure. Sure. I got nothin' to lose.
Why not? Let's do it.

605
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:04,812
Do you believe in God,
Tommy?

606
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:09,223
- Yeah, I believe in God.
- Okay. Yeah.

607
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:13,559
- Really?
- Well, don't you?

608
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:16,395
I think there's a god.

609
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:19,732
And I'm not it. Okay.

610
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:23,171
Is there anyone you hate enough to want dead,
and if somebody said they'd kill that person...

611
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:27,678
and the crime wouldn't be discovered,
would you let them go ahead and do it?

612
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,841
L... That's a hard one.
I don't want anybody dead.

613
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,282
- This is Pete, Tom. You can tell me.
- All right.

614
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:39,255
- Maybe, uh... Maybe one guy, okay?
- One guy.

615
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,655
There's always that one fuckin' guy,
you know?

616
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:43,717
- That one fucking asshole.
- One fuckin' guy.

617
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,921
One fuckin' guy.
That's right. Okay.

618
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,261
Do you look at your bowel movements
before you flush the toilet?

619
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:51,460
- Oh, come on, Peter.
- Just humor me.

620
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:55,904
Look, come on.
Is it... whoa, a foot-long floater.

621
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:59,534
You don't even want
to say good-bye to it.

622
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,737
You give it a name,
you know.

623
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:04,975
All right. Yeah, I look.
Who doesn't look? You look, right?

624
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:07,677
Abso-fuckin'- lutely,
I look.

625
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,983
I went to
a space shuttle launch.

626
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:16,391
As the shuttle was taking off...
I could put binoculars right in...

627
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,486
Straight through my frames
because there's no lenses there.

628
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,724
The space scientists
were all huddled around me.

629
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:25,565
"How can I get a pair of glasses like that?
How can I get a pair of glasses like that?"

630
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:29,128
Because they're all standing there with
those tacky little strings around their neck...

631
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:33,404
with glasses hanging or they've got them
on their bald heads.

632
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:38,642
Or I'll be in a restaurant, and when I go
to read the menu I flip the lenses up.

633
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:41,583
And people come over and say,
"How can I get a pair of glasses that do that?"

634
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:44,120
So I saw what my future was.

635
00:38:44,188 --> 00:38:47,453
Th-That perhaps
my future lay...

636
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:50,460
uh, in eyeglass
frame manufacturing.

637
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:54,760
Or being sponsored
by a frame manufacturer.

638
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:58,131
And I was gonna call it
"Lou's Views."

639
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:01,660
- Are you satisfied with the size and shape of your penis?
- Oh, cripe!

640
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:05,835
Peter, come on. That's a personal
question. That's a personal question.

641
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,845
These are not... No one's gonna know
this is you. There's no name.

642
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:11,381
- Who's gonna see this stuff?
- It just gets processed into a computer.

643
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:15,249
- No. But who is?
- No. You're not satisfied?

644
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:18,880
What is it? Girth, no distance?
Distance, no girth? No girth, no distance?

645
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:22,119
Between you and me?
No, I'm... The length is good...

646
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:27,825
the width is questionable, and I got a
little... It curves a little to the left.

647
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:30,992
- You got a curved one?
- You know, it leans a little bit.

648
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:34,765
A leaner. Okay.
That counts in horseshoes.

649
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:38,104
How much money would it take
for you to eat a bowl of shit, Tom?

650
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:43,943
Hey! I'm gonna tell
you somethin'. That I won't do.

651
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:47,882
Every man's got his price, right,
but not me. No, no. Not Tommy Fennili.

652
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,887
- No. Me? Uh-uh. I don't eat shit.
- No shit for Tommy.

653
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,185
It's against my religion.

654
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:56,950
What religion is that, Tom?

655
00:39:57,027 --> 00:40:01,464
The religion of sanity, Peter.

656
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:03,966
You should try it sometime.

657
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:07,629
I belonged. They excommunicated
me. Let me tell you something.

658
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:12,904
In an insane society,
the sane man must appear insane.

659
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:14,808
San... Okay.

660
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:24,944
"Insanity is the logic
of an accurate mind..."

661
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,320
- "Overtaxed."
- "Overtaxed"!

662
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:29,552
- Oliver Wendell Holmes.
- Yeah, I heard that.

663
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:32,289
Goddamn it, Tommy!
Goddamn it, thank you.

664
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:34,831
One thing that you do
get here in Brooklyn...

665
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:39,097
which I now know from having driven around
the country and looked elsewhere for it...

666
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,037
you get plastic bags
stuck in trees.

667
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,097
And it really drives me nuts.

668
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:47,667
It's like a flag of chaos.

669
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:51,841
A bag in a tree.
It's a symbol. It just...

670
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:55,408
And I used to see them and just...
They would bug me.

671
00:40:55,486 --> 00:41:00,116
And then one day I realized, you know,
you could get it out of the tree.

672
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:04,127
So a friend and I made
a long bag snagger.

673
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,993
For which we are currently
applying for a patent, in fact...

674
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,965
because no one ever made
something to take bags out of trees.

675
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:12,434
And it works very well.
It's a long aluminum pole.

676
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:16,997
And we can actually reach now
almost, I would say, 50 plus feet.

677
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:19,406
It's fun. It's exercise. It's...

678
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,436
Holding a big pole up and stretching.
We walk a fair amount.

679
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:27,382
And it definitely makes things nice,
you know. Improves the tree.

680
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:31,079
This is your basic bag
in a tree.

681
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,852
This can be recorded on film.
We know that it existed.

682
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:40,227
And when you come back, it will be...
only an image on film...

683
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:43,130
because I will
have taken it out.

684
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,727
- Is this your mission in Brooklyn?
- I don't consider it a mission.

685
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:50,137
It's more like a hobby. Something to do
with my friends. It's fun to do.

686
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:54,200
And it's very satisfying. It's also...
It used to be I would see a bag like that...

687
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:57,076
and just shrug and think,
"Well, there's that bag."

688
00:41:57,147 --> 00:42:01,243
And now I see a bag and I think,
"You're comin' out, pal."

689
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:08,120
Once there was a major league
baseball team in Brooklyn.

690
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,786
But that was a long time ago.

691
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:18,626
<i>Jackie Robinson,
Brooklyn's famed number 42...</i>

692
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,932
<i>baseball's first Negro
in the major leagues...</i>

693
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:24,236
<i>continues to captivate fans
nationwide with his daring play.</i>

694
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:29,001
Boy, when they moved
the Dodgers out of Brooklyn...

695
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:32,173
I don't believe
there ever was a worse day.

696
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,410
Maybe when the war
was declared.

697
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:38,581
But other than that, I don't think that
Brooklyn ever experienced a worse day...

698
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:42,422
than when they moved
the Dodgers to California...

699
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,688
and the wrecking ball
hit Ebbets Field.

700
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:47,253
There was nothing like it.
The stadium, the ball park...

701
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:50,232
was like a little old
country club.

702
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,065
The fans all knew each other,
and the Dodgers' Symphony...

703
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:56,129
was a group of workin' guys
that went out...

704
00:42:56,206 --> 00:43:00,643
played the trombone, the trumpet, the drums
and generally made fools out of themselves.

705
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:02,838
Everybody loved them
and they didn't care.

706
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,473
The ballplayers
all lived in Brooklyn!

707
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:09,349
They weren't all from Brooklyn,
but they lived on Bedford Avenue...

708
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:14,653
and they used to rent apartments right around
the stadium, right around Ebbets Field.

709
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:17,159
Everybody knew 'em in the neighborhood.
"Hey, Duke Snider!

710
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:20,822
Jackie! How're you?" You know, whatever.
It was like a family thing.

711
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:23,799
Now, no more baseball
in Brooklyn.

712
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:52,085
Hey, Auggie, it's a lot of money.
I'd be crazy to turn it down.

713
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,926
<i>After 19 years,
youre just gonna walk away?</i>

714
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:57,194
I can't believe it.

715
00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,929
It's dollars and cents.

716
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,531
The store's been losing money
for years. You know it as well as I do.

717
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:06,770
But you've got
plenty of money, Vin.

718
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,904
All those real estate deals
out on the island.

719
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:12,778
I mean, you just
write this place off on your taxes.

720
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:15,580
Too late.
We're already in contract.

721
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:21,416
Hmph. So
the Brooklyn Cigar Company...

722
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,960
is gonna become
a health food store?

723
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,555
Times change, Auggie.

724
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:32,363
Tobacco's out.
Wheat germ's in.

725
00:44:32,436 --> 00:44:34,904
You know, it may not be
such a bad thing for you, either.

726
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:39,932
I mean, uh, maybe it's time
you moved on too.

727
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:45,904
I don't wanna see you turn into an
old man sitting behind that counter.

728
00:44:45,983 --> 00:44:48,781
Everybody has to grow old.

729
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,015
What difference does it make
where it happens?

730
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:02,555
No more free cigars,
huh, Auggie?

731
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:06,034
You really should
think this thing through before you...

732
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:09,561
let it happen, Vincent.

733
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,838
I mean, sure. It's a dinky,
little nothing neighborhood store.

734
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:16,471
But everybody comes in here.

735
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:20,916
I mean, not just the smokers. The kids
come in, the school kids for their candy.

736
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:24,112
Old Mrs. McKinna comes in
for her soap opera magazines.

737
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:27,055
Crazy Louie
for his cough drops.

738
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,684
Frank Diaz
for his El Deario.

739
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,923
Fat Mr. Chin
for his crossword puzzles.

740
00:45:32,996 --> 00:45:35,624
I mean, the whole neighborhood
comes in here.

741
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:37,599
It's a hangout.

742
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:40,068
And it helps to keep
the neighborhood together.

743
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:42,367
Twenty blocks from here...

744
00:45:42,439 --> 00:45:46,341
12-year-old kids are shootin'
each other for their sneakers.

745
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:51,575
I mean, you close this store
and it's one more nail in the coffin.

746
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:54,708
You'll be helpin'
to kill off this neighborhood.

747
00:45:56,687 --> 00:46:00,817
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
Is that what you're doin'?

748
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:03,883
No. I'm just
givin'you the facts.

749
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:06,521
You can do
what you want with them.

750
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:17,033
That Auggie,
he's gonna drive me crazy.

751
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:21,703
Just when I get the deal together,
he comes in playin' those fuckin' violins.

752
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:24,840
Brooklyn! Hmph.

753
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:30,712
Brooklyn. I'm supposed
to care about Brooklyn.

754
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:34,121
I don't even live in this
shit hole of a town anymore.

755
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:44,066
Hiya, Vinny.

756
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,602
Jackie!

757
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:50,128
In the flesh, sport.

758
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:54,667
Jackie, the greatest
ballplayer of them all.

759
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:58,340
I used to pray for you
every night when I was a kid.

760
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:02,044
I was the man
that changed America, Vinny.

761
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,782
And I did it all right here,
in Brooklyn.

762
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:09,155
Oh, they spat at me.
Cursed me.

763
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,694
Made my life
a never-ending hell.

764
00:47:11,762 --> 00:47:14,128
And I wasn't allowed
to fight back.

765
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,794
It takes its toll,
being a martyr.

766
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:24,807
I died when I was
53 years old, Vinny.

767
00:47:24,875 --> 00:47:28,106
Even younger
than you are now.

768
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:31,306
But I was a hell
of a ballplayer, wasn't I?

769
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:35,112
The best, Jackie.
You were the best there was.

770
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,676
Things changed after me.

771
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:41,121
Not just for black people.
For white people too.

772
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:45,184
After me, well, white people
and black people...

773
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:49,699
never looked at each other
in the same old way anymore.

774
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:53,600
And it all happened
right here, in Brooklyn.

775
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:59,475
Yeah, then they...
moved the team away.

776
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:03,377
Almost broke my heart. What'd they do
a dumb thing like that for?

777
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:07,440
Dollars and cents,
Vinny.

778
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:10,042
Ebbets Field
may be gone now...

779
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:14,284
but what happened there
lives on in the mind.

780
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:19,261
That's where it counts, Vinny.
Mind over matter.

781
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:23,356
There are more important
things in life than baseball.

782
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:27,426
But, Brooklyn looks good.

783
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:31,338
More or less the same it was
the last time I saw it.

784
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,571
And Prospect Park over there.

785
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:37,739
Still as beautiful as ever.

786
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:45,417
Say, Vinny, they don't still
make those Belgian waffles, do they?

787
00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:50,984
Ah, man! What I wouldn't give to sink
my teeth into a Belgian waffle!

788
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:55,054
Two scoops of pistachio ice cream,
some bananas on top.

789
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:58,727
Hmph. Boy,
do I miss those things.

790
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:02,761
Belgian waffles, sure.
They still make 'em.

791
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:06,434
Just go down two blocks
to the Cosmic Diner.

792
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:10,276
Jackie, they'll make you
all the Belgian waffles you want.

793
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:13,316
Thanks, sport.

794
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:16,352
Don't mind if I do.

795
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,720
A day in Brooklyn just wouldn't be complete
without stopping in for a Belgian waffle.

796
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,759
Would it?

797
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:30,700
Every day 7,999...

798
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:35,295
Belgian waffles are eaten
in the restaurants of Brooklyn.

799
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:39,536
The, the waffle culture
in Belgium is, um, is complex.

800
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:43,978
Waffles generally are made in huge
batches, and then they're eaten cold.

801
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:48,814
They're not a breakfast food. Uh, they're
like cookies or something, or raisin bread.

802
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:53,151
They're that kind of food. You eat
them with coffee in the afternoon.

803
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:57,956
The Belgian waffle as it's known here, with
great piles of strawberries and whipped cream...

804
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:02,362
is something that Belgians
are never failed to be amazed by.

805
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:05,026
I think Belgians
kind of like Belgian waffles.

806
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:09,835
But to them, Belgian waffles
seem distinctly American.

807
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:13,740
They've got that big Hollywood
overproduction to them, which Belgians...

808
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:18,076
It's kind of foreign to Belgians
to overdo things quite in that way.

809
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:34,329
Cigarettes are sort of like
a reminder of your mortality in a way.

810
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:39,995
Like each puff is like
a passing moment, a passing thought.

811
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:43,369
You know, you smoke.
Smoke disappears.

812
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,605
It reminds you that
to live is also to die somehow.

813
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:52,273
I don't know, I'm gonna miss 'em.
But anyway, last one is with you, Auggie.

814
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:56,809
Boom!

815
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,447
Shit.

816
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:02,253
It's out, man. Got a light?

817
00:51:05,529 --> 00:51:07,463
Adios.

818
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,726
Adios, amigo.

819
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:13,326
Adios, "cigarrettos. '

820
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:21,434
L. S. Equals M. F. T.

821
00:51:21,511 --> 00:51:24,139
Loose stomach
means full toilet.

822
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:27,741
Or something like that.

823
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:31,811
When we were kids, that's what
we used to say about Lucky Strikes.

824
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:34,083
Yeah, there it is.

825
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:36,682
What'd I tell you?

826
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,422
I love this too.
"It's toasted."

827
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:43,694
Oh, boy.

828
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,997
They sure do
take us for a ride, huh?

829
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:48,799
- How's it taste?
- Tastes great.

830
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:01,651
There he goes.

831
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:05,882
Thirty seconds over Tokyo.

832
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:08,015
Bombs away.

833
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:12,727
- Want a smoke?
- No, thanks. I quit.

834
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,855
<i>Ebbets Field,
"Shrine of Flatbush, '</i>

835
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:19,128
<i>will make way
for apartment houses.</i>

836
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:28,838
<i>The old ball park, standing for nearly
half a century, comes to the end of the trail.</i>

837
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,972
<i>The stands where thousands
once roared...</i>

838
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:34,881
<i>await another kind
of wrecking crew.</i>

839
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,884
<i>Home plate is dug up
to find a niche...</i>

840
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,553
<i>in the Baseball Hall of Fame
at Cooperstown.</i>

841
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:49,463
<i>At the sad ceremony, Roy Campanella
is surrounded by old Dodger players...</i>

842
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:52,195
<i>Tommy Holmes, Ralph Branca

843
00:52:52,269 --> 00:52:56,296
<i>They watch stoically for the demolition
of their old playground.</i>

844
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,474
<i>Now it's play ball again...</i>

845
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:04,810
<i>but not the sort
Dodger fans cheer.</i>

846
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:14,015
<i>This time, Ebbets Field itself
is struck out.</i>

847
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:04,168
Today is my birthday,
and I'm 18 now.

848
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:08,439
<i>Da-da-da-da da-da</i>

849
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:11,947
That's so sweet.
Nobody sung it to me yet.

850
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:14,779
Brooklyn will take care
of me tonight, though.

851
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:18,981
If I go around my way and tell everybody
today's my birthday, they'll celebrate.

852
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:22,957
You'll see fireworks,
but they'll be gunshots.

853
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:28,020
And, um... people'll probably hit me
with cakes and eggs and powder socks.

854
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,191
That's how they celebrate
my birthday.

855
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,326
I don't get no cake
and can eat it.

856
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:36,998
I have to get it smashed in my face, and
beat with a powder sock for a surprise party.

857
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:41,737
Walk in my building 'cause somebody beat me
with a sock, and hit me with a egg probably.

858
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:44,712
Y'all have a nice day.

859
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:47,181
- You too. Happy birthday.
- All right. Thank you.

860
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:56,587
Ay, Augusto.!

861
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:02,723
You make me
so horny!

862
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:07,793
You make
my tripas tremble.

863
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:10,863
Ay, Augusto.!

864
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:15,001
You would be
so wonderful...

865
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:18,104
if only you were different.

866
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,681
That Auggie.

867
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:26,017
That Auggie,
he gonna drive me cuckoo!

868
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:32,359
First he say "yes"...
then he say "no."

869
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:37,332
Is "on"...is "off."
Maybe some other time.

870
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:42,269
But Ramon, you see,
he don't know some other time.

871
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:45,604
He's going to play
at Freddie's on the sixteenth.

872
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:50,578
And now, Augusto say
he's too busy on the sixteenth.

873
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,519
Ay.

874
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:59,851
What gives around here, huh?

875
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:03,484
Is somebody deaf
or something?

876
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,257
I talk myself
blue in the face!

877
00:56:07,330 --> 00:56:11,357
And still,
it don't do no good.

878
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:16,936
Lock this door.

879
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:21,204
- I want you to lock this. All right.
- What's with you, Dot?

880
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,038
I don't want to talk to you.
I don't wanna say anything to you.

881
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:29,984
- Um, if he comes to the door, don't let him in.
- Vinny?

882
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,784
- Yeah. Where's the money? I know he keeps money around here.
- I count it...

883
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:38,260
- I know he's got a secret stash besides what's in here, right?
- No, no.

884
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:40,592
- I'm taking this too.
- What's the matter with you?

885
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:43,427
It's only today's receipts.
What are you doing?

886
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,958
I'm taking the money.
I told you before.

887
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:50,233
I'm going to Las Vegas
by myself.

888
00:56:50,306 --> 00:56:52,706
I asked him to go and he doesn't wanna
go, so I'm going to go to Las Vegas.

889
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:55,210
Not only am I going there for a visit,
but I'm going to go there...

890
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:59,112
and I might just fucking live there,
you know what I mean?

891
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:02,879
- What happened?
- What happened? I told you what happened.

892
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:06,183
He's a fuckin' bore.
I'm going to do something exciting.

893
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,851
I'm going to go to Las Vegas,
and I'm going to wait to see Wayne Newton.

894
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,917
You know what I mean?
Then when I see Wayne Newton...

895
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,964
I'm going to chase him down the street
and I'm gonna mount him like Trigger.

896
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:18,296
I want out, and I wanna go have fun.
And I'm gonna. I'm gonna.

897
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,996
And don't try to talk me out of it.
Because the last time I tried to talk to you...

898
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,061
you didn't have nothin' to say to me,
I have nothin' to say to you.

899
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:25,801
I have nothing to say to him.
And you're gonna tell him that for me.

900
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:27,900
Nothing about your life
is boring, right?

901
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:31,970
You're just terribly excited
about everything that you do?

902
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:37,486
You're terribly excited about everything.
Everything's like A-okay, okeydoke, right?

903
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:42,287
- I'm in a good place. Yeah.
- I don't think you're in a good place.

904
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:46,454
I've known ya for a long time.
I don't think you're in a good place.

905
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:51,330
I say that as your friend. I don't think...
I think you could be in a better place.

906
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:55,201
- Like where?
- I don't know! I think you could be in a better place.

907
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,831
Like... I think you could be
in a better place...

908
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:01,809
like... Las Vegas
is a better place.

909
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:04,870
Would you want
to go with me?

910
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:08,213
- What?
- I mean, I have money and everything.

911
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:13,517
I think you deserve to be loved very fucking
well. I really do think that about you.

912
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:17,788
I know you don't have that
and I could do that.

913
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:21,763
I, I could, um...
I could do that.

914
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:25,460
Give me some of this.
I could love you very well.

915
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:29,733
Would you go to Las Vegas
with me?

916
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:34,276
Jesus, Dot.

917
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,902
Would you go to Las Vegas
with me?

918
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:43,276
Will you come to Las Vegas
with me, honey?

919
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:45,685
Dot, Jesus. What am
I doing to my friend, Dot?

920
00:58:45,755 --> 00:58:49,020
Everybody's got friends.
You got enough friends.

921
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:53,459
This ain't right, Dot.
No, no.

922
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,397
No, no. Dot, this ain't right.
This ain't right.

923
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:58,559
Listen, I really care about you.
I really care about you.

924
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:01,934
But this ain't right.
It ain't right. This ain't right.

925
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:04,439
- Listen, listen. Nothing's right.
- No, no, no.

926
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:07,374
Nothing in the whole fucking world
is ever right. Do you know?

927
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:10,105
- Things that are wrong are good!
- Yeah.

928
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:12,170
- They could be good.
- They could be good. That's right.

929
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:14,216
- I've always wanted to kiss you.
- But this is wrong.

930
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,752
I've always wanted to kiss you.
Just let me kiss you.

931
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,719
- I can't say I haven't wanted to kiss you either.
- Just let me kiss you.

932
00:59:18,788 --> 00:59:22,690
I can't say...
No, no, no. Dot.

933
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:27,355
- Dot, I want you to stop it. I want you to stop it.
- Okay, fuck you. I'm going.

934
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:30,830
Good-bye.

935
00:59:38,107 --> 00:59:41,770
Oh, fuck me. Fuck.

936
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,948
What's going on? What's up?

937
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:50,213
- What's going on?
- You see Dot go out? She was just here.

938
00:59:50,286 --> 00:59:51,913
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

939
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:54,582
What's going on?
She didn't talk to me.

940
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:57,956
She seemed very upset.

941
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,478
- Oh, man. Oh, man.
- Where'd you go?

942
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:20,778
Because I did not want you
to come in. Do you understand that?

943
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:22,909
Do you speak English?

944
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:26,649
I don't wanna talk
to you anyway.

945
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:29,157
You're not going anywhere.

946
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:33,286
- Why?
- What do you mean, why? What the hell you talkin' about?

947
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:35,729
- I'm going to Las Vegas.
- For what?

948
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:39,029
For what? To be in show business.
To have excitement.

949
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:43,596
To do things besides watch you sit
on the couch and watch fucking TV.

950
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:47,666
- Be in show business?
- Well, around show business!

951
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:51,680
I'm not talking to him.
Tell him I'm not gonna talk to him.

952
01:00:51,748 --> 01:00:53,773
- You want me to tell him?
- L... What?

953
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,681
- Five times you want me to tell you?
- What did I do?

954
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:59,188
Tell him I'm not talking to him because
he does not know how to communicate.

955
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:01,280
- Communicating. Do you know what that means?
- Yeah. What's the matter?

956
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:04,190
What does it mean?
Tell me what it means. Define it!

957
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:07,127
- Talking to each other.
- Talking. But what comes after talking?

958
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:10,324
Do you have any fucking idea
what comes after talking?

959
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,928
It starts with an "L." I'll give you
a clue. It starts with an "L."

960
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,472
- It's three syllables. You know what it is?
- Yeah.

961
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,973
- What is it?
- Listening.

962
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:22,034
- Yes! Thank you. You win the big fucking jackpot.
- I'm listening.

963
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:25,080
- No, you don't know how to listen.
- I'm listening!

964
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:28,083
I told you what the problem is.
Then why are you asking me again?

965
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:29,618
- I'm listening.
- You're not listening!

966
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:33,281
- What's the problem?
- The problem is that you never, ever listen!

967
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:38,658
- I'm listening now! Tell me!
- You don't listen to me.

968
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,722
What am I doing?

969
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:45,996
- You're listenin'.
- I'm listenin'.

970
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,712
You want a Belgian waffle,
go to Belgium.

971
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:07,278
Don't go to the Dutch part,
go to the French part.

972
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,384
And if I want a Boston egg cream,
should I go to Boston?

973
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:16,626
I want to go to Las Vegas
right now!

974
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:19,361
And I'm goin' with you,
or I'm goin' without you.

975
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:23,064
Because I already have money.
So are you goin' with me or not?

976
01:02:23,139 --> 01:02:26,836
And I'm not even gonna ask you. Forget that
I said that, because you already said no.

977
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:31,107
So I'm not gonna let you
fucking tell me no one more time.

978
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:33,978
We're going to Vegas...
right now!

979
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,518
- We're going to...
- Right the fuck now.

980
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,680
- We're going to Vegas, Auggie.
- Have a good time.

981
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,657
- All right? Yeah, we're going to Vegas.
- We're really goin'? Okay.

982
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:45,091
- Okay?
- Okay. Right now?

983
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:47,994
- All right.
- We're not gonna have...

984
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,157
- We're goin' to Vegas.
- Come on.

985
01:02:50,233 --> 01:02:51,928
- Auggie.
- See ya.

986
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:54,595
Adios.

987
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:57,195
Are we really gonna go?

988
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:00,037
Vegas.

989
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,227
You stand right there, okay?

990
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:28,202
Okay. Here we go.

991
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:33,800
In the words
of the famous poet...

992
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:36,276
Billy Shake-a-speare...

993
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,836
I quote you:

994
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:40,974
What are you doin'?

995
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:45,350
"To be or not to be?

996
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:47,389
That is the question."

997
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:51,552
Jimmy, lock the door.
Put the closed sign on.

998
01:03:51,627 --> 01:03:55,961
Well, Auggie... I am!

999
01:03:56,032 --> 01:03:59,695
Okay? So that is that.

1000
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:03,637
Come here, because
I'm going to make love to you.

1001
01:04:03,706 --> 01:04:08,200
And I'm going to ride you
like a big bull.

1002
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:12,236
Ay.! What's this?
Is this for me?

1003
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:14,579
Oh, yeah, baby,
this is mine.

1004
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:17,483
This is mine, all mine, and only mine.

1005
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:21,956
I cannot bear the thought of you being
with another woman. It makes me crazy!

1006
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:26,654
<i>Never know how much
I love you</i>

1007
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:30,665
<i>Never know how much I care</i>

1008
01:04:30,733 --> 01:04:34,100
<i>When you put your arms
around me</i>

1009
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,105
<i>I get a fever
that's so hard to bear</i>

1010
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,971
<i>You give me fever Yeah</i>

1011
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,567
<i>When you kiss me</i>

1012
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:46,513
<i>Fever when you hold me tight</i>

1013
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:50,313
<i>Fever Ooh, in the morning</i>

1014
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:54,322
<i>Fever all through the night</i>

1015
01:04:54,390 --> 01:05:01,323
<i>Fever</i>

1016
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:04,127
Ay, yeah, Augusto.

1017
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:12,933
<i>Fever Ooh, in the morning</i>

1018
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:16,501
<i>Fever all through the night</i>

1019
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:20,276
<i>Daddy, don't you treat me right
Pow, pow, pow</i>

1020
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:23,011
<i>Ooh</i>

1021
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:27,021
<i>What a lovely way to burn
Ah, ah, ah</i>

1022
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:29,489
<i>Fever</i>

1023
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,958
You like a Spanish women?

1024
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:36,260
I'm glad you like a Spanish women,
because I am Spanish woman.

1025
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:39,699
<i>Ay, ay, ay yeah</i>

1026
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:44,168
<i>S- s-s-s-s</i>

1027
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,232
<i>You give me fever</i>

1028
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:52,678
I can't get enough of you,
Auggie!

1029
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:11,463
Is this the
Brooklyn Cigar Company?

1030
01:06:11,534 --> 01:06:14,059
In the flesh.
What can I do you for?

1031
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:18,163
I'm looking for
a Mr. Augustus Ren.

1032
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:21,732
- Well, you found him, beautiful.
- Great.

1033
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:25,144
I've never been to Brooklyn before.
I wasn't sure I'd find you.

1034
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:30,015
Well, Brooklyn's on the map. We've even
got streets out here. Electricity too.

1035
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:34,147
You don't say? Well?

1036
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:37,954
- Well what?
- I have a telegram for you.

1037
01:06:38,027 --> 01:06:41,656
- Nobody's dead, I hope.
- A singing telegram.

1038
01:06:43,532 --> 01:06:45,796
This gets better and better.

1039
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:48,962
- You ready?
- Ready when you are.

1040
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:58,675
<i>Chee-chee chee-chee-chee

1041
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:01,273
<i>The deal is off Stop</i>

1042
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,750
<i>Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da Boom</i>

1043
01:07:03,819 --> 01:07:06,413
<i>Not sellin' the store Stop</i>

1044
01:07:06,489 --> 01:07:08,855
<i>Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da Boom</i>

<i>I'll see you next week Stop</i>

<i>From Las Vegas</i>

1051
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:32,611
<i>- Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da Boom
- Ooh!</i>

1052
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,740
Dynamite, sweetheart.

1053
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:39,311
Dynamite.
I say that's worth at least a $5 tip.

1054
01:07:42,258 --> 01:07:45,318
Five dollars?

1055
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:47,521
Thanks a lot, mister.

1056
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:51,692
I'll finally be able to buy that
hearing aid my mother always wanted.

1057
01:07:51,767 --> 01:07:55,567
Anytime you got some more good news,
you know where to find me.

1058
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,401
"The deal is off."

1059
01:07:59,475 --> 01:08:01,739
Ba-ba boom.

1060
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:07,278
"Not selling the store.
Stop. See you next week.

1061
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:10,318
Love from Las Vegas."
Ba-ba boom, Jimmy!

1062
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:13,480
Ba-boom! Ba-boom!

1063
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:17,014
- We don't have to leave?
- No. We don't have to leave, Jimmy.

1064
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,187
Keep sweepin'.
Sweep all of Brooklyn, Jimmy.

1065
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,526
Brooklyn is yours.

1066
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:25,562
<i>That's most of it, I think.</i>

1067
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:28,330
<i>Who knows why
all those crazy things happened.</i>

1068
01:08:28,404 --> 01:08:31,100
<i>I mean, maybe
Vinny really did see a ghost.</i>

1069
01:08:31,173 --> 01:08:34,108
<i>And maybe Violet really
was gonna rip my guts out.</i>

1070
01:08:34,176 --> 01:08:36,303
<i>Who could be sure
of anything?</i>

1071
01:08:36,378 --> 01:08:39,541
I love you!

1072
01:08:42,351 --> 01:08:46,310
<i>What I do know is that the day after
Vinny and Dot left for Las Vegas...</i>

1073
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:51,553
<i>the temperature in Brooklyn dropped
below 90 for the first time in two weeks.</i>

1074
01:08:54,763 --> 01:08:57,630
- Wow.
- Well, what are you two lovebirds up to?

1075
01:08:57,700 --> 01:08:59,827
A hell of a lot!

1076
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:04,271
- Do you mind if I join in?
- Of course. Be my guest.

1077
01:09:10,379 --> 01:09:12,870
<i>So I decided
to throw a little party.</i>

1078
01:09:12,948 --> 01:09:17,317
<i>Things had pretty much returned to normal, and
I was feeling good enough to wanna celebrate.</i>

1079
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:19,786
All right, Brooklyn,
I'm gonna teach you a new dance.

1080
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:22,187
It's called "The Brooklyn Cha-Cha."
It's real simple, okay?

1081
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:28,060
It goes like this, okay? Step, step,
cross, open, back, back, cha-cha-cha.

1082
01:09:30,299 --> 01:09:32,927
<i>It wasn't my fault
that things got out of hand.</i>

1083
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:36,995
<i>When 572 citizens of Brooklyn
show up in the same spot...</i>

1084
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:39,734
<i>spirits are bound to run high.</i>

1085
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:42,834
<i>To tell the truth,
I wasn't around to see it all.</i>

1086
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:45,142
<i>Violet and I had other business
to attend to that night...</i>

1087
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:47,876
<i>and I sort of lost track
of the time.</i>

1088
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:52,683
<i>Nine months later, I was passing out
cigars myself... free of charge.</i>

1089
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:57,158
<i>It was a boy.
We named him Jackie.</i>

1090
01:09:57,226 --> 01:10:01,595
<i>His first solid food
was a Belgian waffle.</i>

1091
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,241
Baseball is a beautiful game.
You can't blame it on 'em.

1092
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:17,336
I'm not talking about the game.
The point is...

1093
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:19,881
I'm just saying personally,
the way I feel about it.

1094
01:10:19,949 --> 01:10:22,747
I understand. But you don't see
the beauty of the game?

1095
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:25,878
Just forget it.
Dennis, forget it.

1096
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,355
- Are you the chief?
- Yeah.

1097
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:33,452
El jefecito, eh?
I got something for that thing, huh?

1098
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:36,123
- Huh?
- I got something for you.

1099
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:40,635
- What?
- Cuban cigars.

1100
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:44,730
- Yeah?
- I got some connection. I could do like that.

1101
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:47,742
And you could... you could be okay, man.

1102
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:51,837
- What kind of cigars you got?
- He almost had me. He almost had me.

1103
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,747
- What're you talkin' about, okay?
- Come on, Auggie. Don't you see it?

1104
01:10:54,817 --> 01:10:57,809
- This is serious business here, man.
- See? You hear that voice?

1105
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:00,354
- He was in here last year with the watches.
- What're you talkin' about, man?

1106
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,322
- You don't know me, man. I got connections.
- He was in here.

1107
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:05,360
- You got to be fucking kidding me.
- I can do that for you, man.

1108
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:08,089
- I got connections.
- I don't believe this.

1109
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:10,393
- Man, gimme a kiss.
- What'd I tell you?

1110
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:13,902
- You want a kiss, baby?
- Gimme a kiss.

1111
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:17,405
Oh, man, another scam, huh?
Always on the scam.

1112
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:20,101
- Were you serious about the cigars?
- No.

1113
01:11:20,175 --> 01:11:23,167
- Oh!
- Oh, man. You got a hustle for everything.

1114
01:11:23,245 --> 01:11:25,213
- What? Do you like it here? Were you lonely?
- Wh-What do you think?

1115
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,010
- You like it? You like me like this?
- You look good!

1116
01:11:27,082 --> 01:11:28,777
- You like it?
- Nice.

1117
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:30,785
- Te gusta?
- Who are you this week?

1118
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:32,878
- Valentino.
- Valentino, huh?

1119
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:38,689
- Valentino. The lover. The Latin lover! The lover!
- Like me.

1120
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:41,321
Do you sit at home
and think this stuff up?

1121
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:44,662
No, actually I'm on my way.
I got a 3:30 appointment.

1122
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:47,998
- I got a record contract that... might happen.
- Ooh!

1123
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:51,164
- Do you wanna buy a bridge?
- Very funny.

1124
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,504
No, seriously, man, seriously.
No, I'm very musical.

1125
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:56,305
- He's got the voice for it.
- He could, he could do it.

1126
01:11:56,378 --> 01:11:58,403
- I got a record deal happenin'.
- I think he could do it.

1127
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:02,473
- Sure, man, you got a voice.
- You know, God bless Brooklyn to make me who I am today.

1128
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:07,250
I'm glad you guys like the suit. I figured I'd
try to pull one more scam on you before I go.

1129
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:10,349
Pull a scam on the man!
'Cause, see. You understand. Like...

1130
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:11,893
- Where're you from?
- Me?

1131
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,894
- Yeah.
- Well, my family's from...

1132
01:12:13,962 --> 01:12:16,487
"My family!" Why do they always do that?
Man, he's from Italy.

1133
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:19,295
- Where're you from? France? You French now?
- I'm proud to be...

1134
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:21,996
- I'm Puerto Rican all the way through.
- You're Puerto Rican.

1135
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:25,939
- I'm Puerto Rican, but...
- What's wrong with you guys, man? Jesus Christ!

1136
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:29,910
Now, you're gonna tell me he's black!
He's Italian. You're French and he's black.

1137
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:35,041
What's up, brother?
How you doin', black man?

1138
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:38,712
You got a great rap,
but you gotta follow this stuff up.

1139
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:41,654
What's you talkin', follow it up?
Look at the suit, baby!

1140
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:43,885
No, no, the suit.
All right, the clothes make the man.

1141
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:47,087
But, you know, you gotta decide
what you wanna do with your life.

1142
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,630
You're gonna go out here, get another...
Next week, he's gonna come back...

1143
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:51,996
he's gonna be selling
used cars outside.

1144
01:12:52,067 --> 01:12:54,865
- Next week I'm gonna have a record deal.
- You could have a record deal...

1145
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:57,235
- but you gotta go for it, you know what I mean?
- Like this cigar?

1146
01:12:57,306 --> 01:13:00,298
- I like the cigar.
- I took up smoking.

1147
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:04,142
There's numerous possibilities for you.
Right? You never know what life's about.

1148
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:06,943
That's your problem. I don't think
you're really realistic, black man.

1149
01:13:07,015 --> 01:13:10,007
- I'm realistic.
- See, last time I was in here, you really pissed me off.

1150
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:12,144
Hanging around
these white people.

1151
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:16,658
- Now you got Julio here acting like he's Francois! Please!
- Francois?

1152
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:19,455
A buddy of mine...
We were ten years old. All right?

1153
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:22,554
We all dared this guy to go in
and rip off this chicken joint.

1154
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:26,067
It was owned by this German guy. And we
thought this German guy, he's a real square.

1155
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:28,729
He's a white guy.
He lived in Harlem, right?

1156
01:13:28,804 --> 01:13:31,864
So we dared the kid to go in.
The kid, he had balls, right?

1157
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:35,671
He goes in, but the guy
already locked up the night's receipts.

1158
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:37,712
But he had a little cash
in his pocket.

1159
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,715
So the guy, he goes in, he hits the guy
over the head with a bottle.

1160
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:44,776
He gets his little cash out of the guy's
pocket, leaves him on the floor for dead.

1161
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:48,186
The guy lives, of course. Kid's ten
years old. Goes home, all right?

1162
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,316
His mother says, "Where'd
you get this money?"

1163
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:52,519
She goes in his room next morning
to wake him up, the money's on the bureau.

1164
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:56,655
"Where'd you get this money?" He's not
gonna tell her where he got the money, okay?

1165
01:13:56,732 --> 01:14:00,566
She finds out the guy on the corner
was robbed. She puts it together.

1166
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:04,402
She takes the kid, drags him
by his collar back into the store.

1167
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:08,204
The guy is there. His head's bandaged.
He's doing his day's business.

1168
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:11,246
She says,
"Did my son rob you?"

1169
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:14,407
The guy looks at the kid.
"Yeah, I think it was him.

1170
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:16,678
But it's okay, he's ten
years old, he's young. I don't care."

1171
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:18,913
She says, "Well, he's yours.
What do you want to do with him?

1172
01:14:18,987 --> 01:14:20,921
"You want to send him to jail?
What do you want to do with him?

1173
01:14:20,989 --> 01:14:22,957
You want him to work for you?
What, what do you want?"

1174
01:14:23,025 --> 01:14:28,327
So he gives the kid a job. The kid sweeps
up the store like Jimmy, every day.

1175
01:14:28,397 --> 01:14:32,333
Then eventually he's washing dishes.
Then eventually he's like cleaning tables.

1176
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:35,996
I run into this guy,
all right, ten years later.

1177
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:37,595
I looked at him, I said,
"What are you doin' with yourself?"

1178
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:39,698
He says, "You know the chicken joint?"
I said, "The chicken joint?

1179
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:44,303
That was when you were ten years old!"
He says, "I own the place."

1180
01:14:44,379 --> 01:14:48,645
The German guy died,
left him the place...

1181
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:51,618
and the guy is making money
hand over fist. So you never know, right?

1182
01:14:51,687 --> 01:14:54,781
That's your problem. I'm a black man,
and I got to sell fried chicken.

1183
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:57,485
That's your problem, man.
I got to be selling chicken.

1184
01:14:57,559 --> 01:15:00,426
- That ain't got nothing to do with my...
- That's not the point.

1185
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,589
- I'm trying to make it...
- The point is...

1186
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:05,929
out of something really horrible,
something really great happened.

1187
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:09,698
- You got some watermelon too?
- Come on. That's not the point.

1188
01:15:09,771 --> 01:15:13,172
- Okay, that was okay. That was...
- That could happen.

1189
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:16,302
Relax, I'm jokin'!
I got you. That's good. Thank you.

1190
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:19,142
- Hey.
- Black people got to stick together, black man.

1191
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:21,842
- I got a watch.
- Hey, I got one. Check it out.

1192
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:25,148
Hey, what do you think about the suit?
Hey, hey, hey. Te gusta?

1193
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:27,154
- Yeah, it's good.
- All right, baby.

1194
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:30,988
Where's that $10 I gave you last time
I saw you? Remember the $10?

1195
01:15:31,059 --> 01:15:33,425
- You got a short memory. Remember the $10 I gave you?
- Yeah.

1196
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:36,896
- Whenever you can, you give it back to me, all right?
- Okay. Thanks a lot though.

1197
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:39,763
- He's got a heart.
- I bought some fried chicken with it.

1198
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:41,803
I got some good news,
I got some bad news.

1199
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:46,000
The good news is that you're all here.
The bad news is I'm gonna sing.

1200
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:53,775
<i>Well I was gonna join the army
when you turned me down</i>

1201
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:59,151
<i>But I was rejected
so I headed for the river to drown</i>

1202
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:04,921
<i>Well, I've reconsidered
decided life shouldn't end</i>

1203
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:07,985
<i>'Cause girls like you
are a dime a dozen</i>

1204
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:10,088
<i>And I got a nickel to spend</i>

1205
01:16:10,165 --> 01:16:13,692
<i>- Everybody.
- Girls like you are a dime a dozen</i>

1206
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:17,603
<i>And I got a nickel to spend</i>

1207
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:23,043
<i>Hey, don't you feel no pity
I'm a-living in paradise</i>

1208
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:28,743
<i>They say life's a piece of cake,
hell I'm gonna get me a slice</i>

1209
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:33,049
<i>Well, I see fine chicks all around me
Yeah, I'm getting the urge</i>

1210
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:37,649
<i>'Cause girls like you
are a dime a dozen</i>

1211
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:40,286
<i>- And I got a nickel to splurge
- Ya-hoo!</i>

1212
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:43,297
<i>Yeah, girls like you
are a dime a dozen</i>

1213
01:16:43,365 --> 01:16:46,061
<i>And I got a nickel to splurge</i>

1214
01:16:46,134 --> 01:16:48,932
<i>Yeah, girls like you
are a dime a dozen</i>

1215
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:51,871
<i>- And I got a nickel to splurge
- Brooklyn style now.</i>

1216
01:16:51,940 --> 01:16:54,670
<i>Yeah, girls like you
are a dime a dozen</i>

1217
01:16:54,743 --> 01:17:01,174
<i>And I got a nickel to splurge</i>

1218
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:27,561
- Why are you... Why are you still smoking?
- I'm not inhaling.

1219
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:44,613
- What does it do?
- Stand back, asshole.

1220
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:49,548
You know, in case you get stuck up
or something, you just pull the fish out.

1221
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:03,199
That's not food.
That's sugar and... and shit.

1222
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:06,035
You know what that causes?
Diabetes.

1223
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:08,099
- Not to me, man.
- Oh, yeah?

1224
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:10,269
No, 'cause I got
sugar blockers.

1225
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:22,387
<i>Why can't we be friends</i>

1226
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:24,448
I'm sittin' out here
readin' the paper...

1227
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:27,893
To most people it looks like
I'm not doin' a goddamn thing.

1228
01:19:27,963 --> 01:19:32,161
Havin' some coffee, right?
Smokin' a cigar. Hangin' out with Auggie.

1229
01:19:32,234 --> 01:19:35,135
But... they look at me.
They tip their hat.

1230
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:37,171
"Good morning. How you doin'?"

1231
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:40,106
They look at you. What do they see?
They think you're a mugger.

1232
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:42,939
<i>Well, early in the mornin'
Or even when it's late</i>

1233
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:46,344
<i>I call my baby on the phone
up in the 718</i>

1234
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:49,713
<i>And I think about the way
that she does love me</i>

1235
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,946
<i>And I wish that
she weren't so hot</i>

1236
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,989
I talk on the phone a lot
so people can't see that I'm black.

1237
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:57,388
But I really believe that...
I'm Sicilian.

1238
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,723
- No, no, it's good.
- It's good. You like it? Do you believe me?

1239
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:03,561
- I totally got it.
- I can't get my shoulders out of my frickin' ass here.

1240
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:05,293
<i>Put them all together
we got the same attitude</i>

1241
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:07,392
<i>Very necessary being rude
That's the Brooklyn mood</i>

1242
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,437
<i>It's the place where
it's hard to shed a tear</i>

1243
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:13,133
<i>People are filled with little care,
any sympathy you won't find it here</i>

1244
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:17,269
That's the same problem we had. 'Cause I'm
a black man you don't think I can be Italian!

1245
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:25,485
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Wish I knew how to say</i>

1246
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:29,787
I had a friend.
Man, he loved cigarettes so much...

1247
01:20:29,858 --> 01:20:32,418
he used to like set his alarm clock
for the middle of the night.

1248
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:37,158
Like he'd go to sleep. He'd set it for four
hours later, wake up, have a cigarette.

1249
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:57,107
Butt me.

1250
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:59,517
Last pack. Get your
filthy hands off'em!

1251
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:47,799
<i>When I was a young man
No bigger than this</i>

1252
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:52,272
<i>A chocolate egg cream
was not to be missed</i>

1253
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:56,436
<i>Some U Bet's chocolate syrup
seltzer water mix it with milk</i>

1254
01:21:56,511 --> 01:22:01,642
<i>You stir it up into a heady froth
Tasty just like silk</i>

1255
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:06,210
<i>You scream, I steam
We all want egg cream</i>

1256
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:14,457
<i>You scream, I steam
We all want egg cream</i>

1257
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:21,028
<i>So the next time
you're in Brooklyn</i>

1258
01:22:21,102 --> 01:22:23,366
<i>Please say hello for me</i>

1259
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:28,034
<i>At Totonno's for pizza and ice cream
and at Al and Shirley's</i>

1260
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:30,475
<i>But mostly you go
to Becky's</i>

1261
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:35,107
<i>Sit in the booth and you say hello,
and have two chocolate egg creams</i>

1262
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:38,118
<i>One to stay and one to go</i>

1263
01:22:38,186 --> 01:22:42,885
<i>You scream, I steam
We all want egg cream</i>

1264
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:51,661
<i>Ah, you scream, I steam
We all want egg cream</i>

1265
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:00,869
<i>Yes, directly
from the planet of Brooklyn</i>

1266
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:04,469
<i>We have Bush Babees
in the house</i>

1267
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:06,946
<i>In your area
Yes</i>

1268
01:23:07,015 --> 01:23:10,143
<i>Oh, one time for your mom
Yes</i>

1269
01:23:10,218 --> 01:23:12,652
<i>Brooklyn's in the place
Yes</i>

1270
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:14,951
<i>Go take it to your face</i>
