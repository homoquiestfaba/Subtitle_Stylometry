1
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,300
- I do it when she is turned around,

2
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,700
she doesn't even realize who has done it

3
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,100
- It's fun

4
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,600
You hide...

5
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,500
and if they found you...

6
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,200
you lose.

7
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,100
- Three...

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,300
Two...

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,200
One

10
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,700
- This is the girl's bathroom

11
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,900
- I'm hiding...

12
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,700
I don't like her

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,100
I don't like the way she looks,

14
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,000
the way she dresses

15
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,400
She is weird

16
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Everyone says that.

17
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,700
- Hide his ears...hmm... hair over his eyes,

18
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,200
hmm...he wears ripped up pants, ripped up shirts,

19
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,000
wears up the exact same thing 
everyday in school

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,300
- Don't cut too much

21
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
He smells bad, looks bad and...

22
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,700
yeah...I find him weird, that's why.

23
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,000
- Do you like dolls?
- Sometimes I do

24
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,300
- For what?

25
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,900
- Just do some things with them,

26
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,900
cut their hairs and just...

27
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,400
do what I want to them.

28
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
Look at this doll...

29
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,200
di-du-di-du- di-du

30
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,100
I want to come to your house, Dana...ahh...

31
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,300
Do you like it?
- No

32
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,300
- Well...

33
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,200
and what about this one?

34
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,100
Hi, Dana

35
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,800
I want to play with you

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,900
You see, she likes you!

37
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,900
Do you mind to come to my house?

38
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,300
Wanna do it?
- No

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,200
- Come on! We can do anything
you want with the doll

40
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,100
- How about this?

41
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,900
You go ask the storeman how much is it and
I'll think about it

42
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,000
- Ok!

43
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,400
- Which one?
 - The blonde one

44
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,200
- Oh, that's gonna be ten dollars.

45
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,700
We have others not quite so expensive...
like the red hair one

46
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,700
That one will be much cheaper.

47
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,600
- I'll ask my friend, she's right over...

48
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
- What I like to do for fun?

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,800
I like to hang out with my friends,

50
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,700
go to the parties,

51
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,700
shopping...

52
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,700
I like to go trying clothes...
buying them...

53
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,200
Having great time...
It's a lot of fun.

54
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,300
- I like playing sports,

55
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,600
I like watching my favourite sport teams on TV

56
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,500
I like following my favourite sport teams
on internet

57
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
and I like playing with my friends and

58
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,900
hanging out with my friends,
going for pizza and stuff...

59
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,300
- Yeah, I hang out with my friends
on the week end

60
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,200
We also sometimes hang out after school

61
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,200
Hmm...we like to go to the movies

62
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,900
we go to each other's houses...

63
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,600
Of course it's fun to talk about boys

64
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,200
- I'm going to sing you a song

65
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,900
- Did you write it by yourself?
- Yes

66
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,700
- How long did it take you?

67
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,600
- Fifteen minutes...

78
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,800
- Well, there is Griffin

79
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,800
and, I'm pretty sure he is gay

80
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,900
and it's really annoying

81
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,700
because he is like hanging on me

82
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,200
and sharing and talking about
how he really likes this dude...

83
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,100
and it really pisses me off,
I can't stand all this gay stuff.

84
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,900
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Sure

85
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,300
- He just, you know, he's always there,
he is always around me...

86
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,800
and I think ihe starts liking me

87
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,100
and I don't want him ....to get near me with that.

88
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,600
- Well, pretty much you have to throw
a ball into a basket

89
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,700
but there are more defined rules.

90
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,000
Well, we always play five on five

91
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,700
and, usually Phil makes the shot,

92
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,600
and you take the ball back and
go again.

93
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,200
- Sometimes I take my friends

94
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,400
because we work well together and we like
to have fun.

95
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,100
But sometimes have to pick up 
other people because

96
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,200
they are like good team players

97
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,200
and they know how to play basketball
well compared to me. 

98
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,700
- I'm not sure, I mean if I was playing as...

99
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,900
if I was him playing basketball

100
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,400
I wouldn't play at all...because...

101
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,700
I'm pretty sure he would get hurt, he...

102
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,300
- Estela...
- Britney...

103
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,100
- Tara...

104
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,100
- Sena...

105
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,900
- Tori...

106
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
- Kayla

107
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
- Rachel

108
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
- Maria

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
- Let see that...
- Go first

110
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
- Hmm...

111
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,900
Yes...Mary

112
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,500
- He doesn't shower with us

113
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,600
He has to wait
That's how it works

114
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,400
Everybody knows it.

115
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,200
One was in charge of taking the bag

116
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,500
I don't remember who's idea it was

117
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
and a bunch of us threw it around

118
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,500
So, we got the good idea about

119
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,700
getting rid of the clothes and  the sneakers...

120
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,200
but nobody wanted to touch the underwear...

121
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,100
I mean, who wants to touch a guy's underwear?

122
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
It's pretty gross, right?

123
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
After all that, it took us a while but

124
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,100
we finally gathered everything and

125
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,000
we threw it up on a tree.

126
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,700
- Thank you

127
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,000
- Kill yourself

128
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,500
- Everything they do...it's just...no normal

129
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
and there is weird.

130
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,200
They're freaks.

131
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,700
- I heard somebody say that

132
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,400
these guys had a birthday party, right?

133
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,300
and nobody came.

134
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,200
Nobody really likes him,

135
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,200
Everybody is... just kind of avoid him,

136
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,300
doesn't talk to him.

137
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,700
- He's always alone.

138
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He has no friends.

139
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,000
If you're with him,
then you're nobody too.

140
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,600
- You liked him?
- So much...!

141
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,200
- No, I don't
- Yes, you do

142
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,300
- I tell you, I don't!
- We all see it...

143
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,700
- What a bunch of liers...I don't!

144
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,700
- I saw you flirting with him...
- Okay

145
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,100
- Do you have a boyfriend?

146
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,100
- No

147
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,800
- I saw you with a guy earlier.

148
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,700
- He wasn't my boyfriend

149
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,700
- He's kind of weird

150
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,700
- Are you sure you guys staying not together?

151
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
- Yeah

152
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,500
- Why are you so sure?

153
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,500
- He is just asking me questions.

154
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,100
- Dana?

155
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,000
That's your name, right?

156
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,600
Why are you so sure about it?

157
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,200
Come on, tell us...please

158
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,300
- I can't.

159
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,500
- Well, I mean if you don't wanna tell us,
you don't have to.

160
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,200
- Come on, Dana!

161
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,700
-Because it can be fun to share a friend, you know...

162
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,700
- You know, friends tell each other secrets

163
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,200
- You can trust us

164
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,400
- You ain't tell anybody?

165
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,400
- No, we won't
- I promise.

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,500
- He kissed him

185
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,400
Nobody does that

186
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,500
Nobody would dare to do something like that

187
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,000
Never!

188
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,200
They'll catch him

189
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
I heard that his parents moved

190
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,000
He lives in Detriot now.

191
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,500
Some people say that something
really bad happened to him

192
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,600
I think that he probably changed
to another school

193
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,500
I heard that some people say
he committed suicide

194
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,500
I don't think anybody will miss him.
