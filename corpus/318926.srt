1
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,726
Not guilty!

2
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,575
So you were fucking the court stenographer.

3
00:01:18,878 --> 00:01:22,075
I was just fantasizing
I was fucking the court stenographer.

4
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:26,050
- Not sure I like that, David.
- It was you who started this fantasy game.

5
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:29,315
Yeah, and you seem to have mastered it.

6
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:33,890
I wonder what my father would say
if he knew an embassy counselor...

7
00:01:33,993 --> 00:01:35,893
was fantasizing sex in the courtroom?

8
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:39,795
I'm sure the Ambassador has had
a few carnal thoughts in his lifetime.

9
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:43,528
Why don't you ask him
at our little wedding-planning dinner?

10
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,331
I don't think so, Tish.

11
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,735
It's...

12
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,835
interesting.

13
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,448
Welcome to the Alhambra.

14
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,916
The housekeepers leave at sunset.

15
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,047
As you can see,
we have very few guests in winter.

16
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:43,354
Breakfast is served 7:00 to 10:00.

17
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:47,797
No lunch or dinner,
but you will find excellent dining...

18
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,062
in Veszprem.

19
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,472
Wow. This is actually nice.

20
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,348
Very nice.

21
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,921
The baths are open until the night.

22
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,655
They are a short walk from here.

23
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,294
My name is Josef Klim.

24
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:21,293
Anything you need,
do not hesitate to call me.

25
00:03:26,172 --> 00:03:28,697
"Do not hesitate to call me."

26
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:35,239
Okay, is it just me,
or is the Klim guy just a little bit creepy?

27
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:40,242
So you wanna unpack or something?

28
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,283
Or something, huh?

29
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,543
What really is your fantasy?

30
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:13,349
I mean, if you could have...

31
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,085
one thing in the entire world...

32
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,361
what would it be?

33
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,730
Marry you and get elected President.

34
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,899
That's two.

35
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:38,102
Political success. I already have you.

36
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,976
I'm serious.

37
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,675
It's a silly game.

38
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:49,748
I want you to give me one...

39
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:53,090
really good reason
why you want to marry me.

40
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,319
One: I love you.

41
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,990
Two: I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,801
And three: I get to have the most awesome
bachelor party in the world.

43
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,835
I cannot understand
your complete obsession with this night...

44
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:15,744
of infantile debauchery that
your so-called friends have planned for you.

45
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,816
Come here.

46
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:25,714
I want to go see...

47
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,983
these famous baths...

48
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,130
and then I want to come back here and fuck.

49
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,733
Sounds good to me.

50
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,930
"Sounds good to me."

51
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:40,701
You're so adorable.

52
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:47,743
You know, bachelor parties are a tradition.

53
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,773
- It's some tradition.
- Women have them, too.

54
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:56,321
Yeah, I know. Lynn's was absurd.
I mean, imagine 20 college-educated...

55
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,659
My, my.

56
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,641
Incredible.

57
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,837
Don't push your luck.

58
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,917
- Well, I only meant that...
- I know exactly what you meant.

59
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:32,214
I wonder who she is.

60
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:38,991
Why don't you go down there and ask her?
I'm sure she'd appreciate the intrusion.

61
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,399
Where you going?

62
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,760
I didn't drive all this way
to stare at a naked woman.

63
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,397
Well, it seems like
a perfectly good reason to me.

64
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,605
That's funny.

65
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,863
Tell me the truth.

66
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,940
You were just thinking about that woman,
weren't you?

67
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:33,305
No.

68
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,113
Liar.

69
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,686
Okay.

70
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,762
My mother is driving me crazy.

71
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,806
You sure you want to do it now?
Or wait till the spring in the States?

72
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,347
Do not try to weasel out on me.

73
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,281
I came all the way here to get married...

74
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:52,090
before I lose you
to some long-legged Hungarian beauty.

75
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:55,321
We can have the reception in the spring.

76
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,963
What are we gonna do tonight?

77
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:04,401
Your creepy little friend
recommended a restaurant in Veszprem...

78
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:06,664
and told me about this great club.

79
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,237
Can we go, please?

80
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:12,275
Sure. He also told me about that girl.

81
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:14,844
What girl?

82
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:18,179
The one from the baths, remember?

83
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,808
Obviously, you do.

84
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,952
He told me
that she's the only other guest in the hotel...

85
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,023
that she comes here frequently
from Budapest...

86
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:28,287
that she comes from a mega-rich family,
such as yourself...

87
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,725
and she's a model...

88
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,898
and she's done some film.

89
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,665
Did you happen to get her shoe size
while you were at it?

90
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:40,898
- I was just making conversation.
- Just making conversation.

91
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,801
I'm gonna go get a drink. Want one?

92
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,207
You sure?

93
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,130
This afternoon...

94
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,738
you knew we were watching you,
didn't you?

95
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,272
You and your husband?

96
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,508
Fiance.

97
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,576
My name is Risa.

98
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,714
Tish.

99
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,155
So why did you come here?

100
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:54,760
To dance.

101
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,893
I mean here, to the baths.

102
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:02,906
To get away.

103
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:05,300
Have a little adventure.

104
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:13,878
And have you had an adventure?

105
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,086
Not really.

106
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,993
You want one? You and your fiance?

107
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:05,871
Hey!

108
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,233
David!

109
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:12,869
Risa.

110
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,075
Risa, David.

111
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:18,711
I'll get my things.

112
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,477
What's going on?

113
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,749
Just think of it as the best fucking
bachelor party you'll ever have.

114
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,965
I don't know why,
but I wanted to all of a sudden.

115
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,405
It was better than any fantasy.

116
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,975
We're crazy, you know that?

117
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,119
I love you.

118
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,820
I know.

119
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,392
Me, too, to you.

120
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,535
How can you defend them, Richard?

121
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,200
It's not about defending anyone.
I just don't agree with you.

122
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,507
You don't think the White House
is dismantling our civil liberties?

123
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,113
No, I don't think so.

124
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,546
Our guests aren't interested in this, Perry.

125
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:23,314
Well, they should be, dear Sister.
What we do affects everyone.

126
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,823
When we say, "Jump,"
the rest of the world says, "How high?"

127
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,960
That was rude,
and this is not the time or the place.

128
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,256
Why not?

129
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,597
What do you say, Mr. Szamos?

130
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:36,930
Careful, Tamas.
You are very bad at jumping.

131
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:41,466
In these troubled times,
I would presume that safeguards...

132
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,541
might be your President's first priority.

133
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,669
As usual,
my son grossly exaggerates the issue.

134
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,838
Nobody is dismantling anything.

135
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:53,975
It's a perfectly normal price to pay
for homeland security.

136
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,953
Please. They're stealing America...

137
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:01,157
and God forbid if you're anti-war,
pro-choice, or gay...

138
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:04,757
or not one of their fanatical legions
of evangelical hand puppets.

139
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:06,421
Yes, God forbid.

140
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:10,696
What about the Judiciary?

141
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:12,096
Isn't anyone concerned...

142
00:21:12,204 --> 00:21:14,900
that it's being turned into
a goddamn right-wing dog-and-pony show?

143
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:16,531
Perry. Language.

144
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:20,078
Sorry, Mother, but really, it's a joke.

145
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,538
Just like their slash-and-burn
environmental policies.

146
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:26,345
Well, you may not have noticed, Son,
but there is an energy crisis...

147
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,648
and the White House
doesn't have to sugarcoat reality.

148
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:31,222
We are at war...

149
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:35,750
and the world of your tree-hugging ideology
is passe...

150
00:21:35,994 --> 00:21:38,792
and it is uninformed, and it is dangerous.

151
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,891
To the oil companies it is.

152
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,067
Excuse me?

153
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:49,406
Sometimes I think
it's just White House rhetoric...

154
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:51,908
masking conservative support
of big business...

155
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,774
designed to scare us into oil exploration.

156
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:59,143
Everything they're doing
is designed on fear.

157
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:01,744
Fear?

158
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,623
We're a nation scared of our own shadow.

159
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:13,755
How the hell did a liberal Republican
get appointed counselor in your embassy?

160
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,197
He's a very fine lawyer, that's how.

161
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:19,964
Not to mention he's screwing
the Ambassador's daughter.

162
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,097
And doing it quite well, I might add.

163
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,967
Shame on you, Tish. And you, too, Perry.

164
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,411
Pay them no mind.

165
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:33,814
Lynn is my only child
with any sense of grace and subtlety.

166
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,855
These two act like Southern Democrats.

167
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,291
I can't talk to him, anymore. No one can.

168
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:46,421
- It's Mother I feel sorry for.
- I don't.

169
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,898
She should have left him years ago,
especially after that little intern thing.

170
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:53,493
I can't believe you said that
about David and Tish at dinner tonight.

171
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:56,699
I can't believe our dear mother
compared us to Southern Democrats.

172
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,508
She lives in another world.

173
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,135
No shit. She thinks Perry's just flamboyant.

174
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,873
Very funny!

175
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,972
Well, Daddy wasn't amused.

176
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,382
He never is.

177
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,147
Would you like to dance?

178
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,245
I'm married.

179
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,718
Don't be a bitch. He meant me.

180
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,964
There's a rumor going around
that the State Department...

181
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,369
has made a decision
on the Karasz oil leases.

182
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,441
Forget it, Richard,
they're not gonna give it to us.

183
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:32,874
They're gonna give it
to someone with more experience.

184
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:36,905
Look, I know the Vaci deal
didn't work out for you.

185
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:38,710
It wasn't my fault.

186
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,378
I'm not saying it was. It's just...

187
00:23:41,653 --> 00:23:43,985
that comment
you made at dinner didn't help.

188
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,251
I was just fed up with the way
he was hammering Perry all night.

189
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,419
And trust me on this, you can't hurt him.
He's the king.

190
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:52,793
Yeah, well, sometimes you gotta
take a shot at the king...

191
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,526
to remind him the peasants
are still out there.

192
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,603
Yeah, only if you want to remain a peasant.

193
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:14,349
I think I'm gonna call it a night.
I got immigration tomorrow.

194
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:18,617
Okay. I'm gonna stay with my parents
tonight and run interference for Perry.

195
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,953
- Think he's gonna need it.
- Okay.

196
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:23,517
Talk to you later.

197
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,491
- Night, David.
- Love you!

198
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:34,830
So there's a rumor that Harold Simms
is pushing for David and Richard...

199
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,874
to get the Karasz oil leases.

200
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:37,942
Really?

201
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:40,773
This could be David's way
to a congressional seat.

202
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:43,370
The White House would owe him.

203
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:48,614
I wanted to ask how you guys
liked the Alhambra.

204
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,087
I've heard the baths are unbelievable.

205
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,793
Unbelievable.

206
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,338
What happened?

207
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:10,072
He gave us the Karasz oil leases.

208
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:12,800
Then why do you look like
he just had your balls for lunch?

209
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,072
I really wasn't expecting it.

210
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,543
- Good morning, Dora.
- Good morning.

211
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,650
We got the Karasz deal.

212
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:20,979
Congratulations, sir!

213
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,055
So hold all my calls
and get Tish on the line, please.

214
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:27,118
Hang on.

215
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,120
Yeah?

216
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:31,257
Hang on.

217
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,755
Tish! Phone for you.

218
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,298
Can I call you back?

219
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:39,795
David's on the phone for you and we're late.

220
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,705
Hi, babe. What's up?

221
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,867
They gave me the Karasz oil leases.

222
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,438
That's fantastic.

223
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,535
Did you know?

224
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:51,241
Not for sure.
Lynn might've mentioned something.

225
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,681
David, I am very proud of you.

226
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:56,686
Look, I've got to go. We're checking out
the church for the wedding...

227
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,983
but I'll meet you for lunch at Cafe Marue.

228
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,284
Okay.

229
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,971
Where the hell did you get these?

230
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,935
In the mail today.

231
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:56,002
No return address, no note, nothing.

232
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,708
David, we look seriously hot in these.

233
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:03,015
We look like we're in deep shit,
that's what we look like.

234
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,226
I don't understand. I mean, how'd she do it?

235
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:13,661
I don't know.
Maybe someone was there, hiding...

236
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,764
or maybe a camera was planted.

237
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,735
Oh, my God, what if it was the creep?
I mean, think about it, David.

238
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,570
He's the one that told you all about her,
and the club. Remember?

239
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:25,734
If this kind of thing got out...

240
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:27,334
- Can I bring you something?
- No.

241
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,840
At least you're a Harrington.

242
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,444
Meaning what?

243
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:39,717
You got your gazillion-dollar trust fund, and
your daddy's always gonna be there for you.

244
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,154
What are you talking about, David?

245
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:46,095
I never had anyone protect me.

246
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,722
I'm from Wilmington, Delaware.
I grew up on food stamps.

247
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,800
My father?

248
00:27:49,901 --> 00:27:52,699
My father was a fucking drunk
who could never keep a job.

249
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,668
Easy on the melodrama.

250
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,571
You know I've been talking to the Party
about a congressional seat.

251
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,075
The Karasz deal could be my ticket out.

252
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:00,474
I'm not gonna let this fuck it up.

253
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,978
What am I in this?
Just part of your political ambition?

254
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:05,049
Is that what this is all about?

255
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,981
"David marries an ambassador's daughter...

256
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:10,111
"and scores his big chance
to fuck his way to Washington"?

257
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,984
I'm sorry. Tish.

258
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,485
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it the way it sounded.

259
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,559
I love you. You know that.

260
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:32,802
Okay.

261
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,976
Maybe she just sent them
as a souvenir or something.

262
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,881
I want whatever these were made from.

263
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,250
The tape, the film, whatever.

264
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,590
And how do you plan on doing that?

265
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,628
Go back to the Alhambra
and have a little talk with Mr. Klim.

266
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,561
And what if he had nothing to do with it?

267
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,860
Maybe he can tell us where we can find her.

268
00:28:58,169 --> 00:28:59,261
David...

269
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,464
we have people who can
take care of this kind of thing.

270
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,701
No.

271
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,239
No one will ever know about this...

272
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,046
ever.

273
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,659
The Karasz oil lease documents...

274
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,224
and you have that meeting
with Mr. Szamos this afternoon.

275
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:31,835
Dora, get me out of it.
I have something else I have to do.

276
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:34,495
Okay.

277
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:03,890
He's gone.

278
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:06,698
The new manager told me
that he just up and quit the other night.

279
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:10,138
I got the number of the property
management company that hired him.

280
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,106
Well, get in, let's go.

281
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,805
Not till after we get a look at that room.

282
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,774
- What good is that gonna do?
- We might find something.

283
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:19,042
Yeah, like guests.

284
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,914
I knocked. No one's there. Come on.

285
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,054
- Shit!
- What?

286
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,356
I cut myself.

287
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,625
This is crazy. Someone had to hear that.

288
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,672
- How bad is it?
- I'll be fine.

289
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,083
There's somebody staying here.

290
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,047
David, did you hear me?

291
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,453
One of the angles was from above the bed.

292
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:22,170
You see anything?

293
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:25,572
There's a wire.

294
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,088
Here.

295
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,055
David.

296
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,367
It's a camera.

297
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,791
No one's asked for any money.

298
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:19,723
Not yet.

299
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,033
Look, maybe we should just tell my father.

300
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:29,569
I might as well put a gun to my head
and pull the trigger.

301
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,102
We'll go to that company he worked for.

302
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:35,944
I'll find him...

303
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,548
and we'll give him whatever he wants.

304
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,179
Josef Klim doesn't work for us, anymore.

305
00:33:44,288 --> 00:33:46,483
- Since when?
- Two days ago.

306
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:51,058
Most managers are rental gypsies.
They live where they work.

307
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:56,026
The Alhambra was his last known residence,
as far as I know.

308
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,030
That is his cell phone number.

309
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:02,198
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

310
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:05,332
Here's my card.
If you hear anything, please call.

311
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,637
I will.

312
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:08,803
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

313
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,320
He's not answering. There's no voice mail.

314
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,018
So we wait.

315
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,826
See what they have in mind.

316
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:29,225
Maybe I can get Dora
to get a billing address for his cell phone.

317
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:32,958
Yeah.

318
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,575
I am so sorry about this, David.

319
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,172
This whole thing, it's my fault.

320
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,683
I could've said no that night.

321
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,869
I don't see what you have
against a jazz combo.

322
00:35:11,375 --> 00:35:14,776
Well, Mother, we were hoping
for something a little more upbeat.

323
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,347
I like jazz. They played jazz at our wedding.

324
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,541
And what about your older wedding guests?

325
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,550
- Fuck them.
- Perry.

326
00:35:21,986 --> 00:35:24,978
No one wants a jazz combo, Mother.
Believe me.

327
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:29,219
Listen to Perry.
He is the artiste in the family.

328
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:31,392
What do you say, David?

329
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,589
David.

330
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:35,558
I'm sorry?

331
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,998
Mother wants to know what kind of music
you want at our reception.

332
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:41,464
I was just saying how a jazz combo...

333
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:43,062
A jazz combo would be great.

334
00:35:43,174 --> 00:35:44,198
David.

335
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,608
Excuse me.

336
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:58,847
- Hey.
- Great party.

337
00:35:58,956 --> 00:36:01,015
- Yeah.
- They're gonna miss you here.

338
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:05,186
Their loss, my gain.
Hey, how's that Karasz thing coming?

339
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:08,059
Slow. There's a lot to sift through.

340
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,862
Well, George Szamos said
he set up a meeting with you...

341
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,526
and you blew him off? What...

342
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,433
I didn't mean to leave him
with that impression.

343
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,439
I'll hook up with him Monday morning.
I promise.

344
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:17,667
This is important, David.

345
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:20,209
I know, sir. I'm not gonna let you down.

346
00:36:21,612 --> 00:36:23,375
I'm not worried about you letting me down.

347
00:36:23,481 --> 00:36:27,178
I'm just... I'm kind of concerned about Tish.

348
00:36:31,756 --> 00:36:33,621
David, I'm not sure you have what it takes.

349
00:36:36,627 --> 00:36:40,654
I mean, you remember
when that Vaci deal fell through...

350
00:36:40,765 --> 00:36:42,357
and we had that meeting?

351
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:47,636
I still feel the same way, you know.
I still see that desperation in your eyes.

352
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:51,533
I mean, I think you're always gonna be
on the outside looking in.

353
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:53,976
It's not your fault.

354
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:57,970
It's this inherent flaw.
It's because of where you come from.

355
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,779
You're never going to understand
the power of wealth...

356
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,515
and the subtle guarantees in life
that come with it.

357
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:08,683
I mean, you can taste it,
and you can smell it, and you can touch it...

358
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,954
but you're never
really gonna understand it...

359
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,860
as desperately as you want to.

360
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:16,390
And desperation leads to failure...

361
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:20,336
and failure isn't what I had in mind
for my daughter.

362
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,177
Tell me something, Lynn.

363
00:37:29,847 --> 00:37:31,872
What's Daddy's pain threshold right now?

364
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:33,208
What do you mean?

365
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:34,406
You know...

366
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,612
with all the talk about the possible
Supreme Court appointment and all...

367
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,883
how much can he take
before he goes ballistic?

368
00:37:40,024 --> 00:37:41,184
What's wrong?

369
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,018
- Oh, my God, are you pregnant?
- No.

370
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,530
- Well, are you in some sort of trouble?
- No.

371
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,769
Look, it's no big deal, really.

372
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:57,196
Just forget I said anything.

373
00:38:13,758 --> 00:38:14,725
Hey.

374
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,634
I can't stop thinking about it.

375
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,335
It's okay.

376
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,235
We'll get through it. We'll find a way.

377
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,549
He's afraid I'll fail you.

378
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,518
What are you talking about? Who's afraid?

379
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,089
Your father.

380
00:38:55,399 --> 00:38:59,563
Tonight, at the reception, he reminded me
that he still blames me for the Vaci deal...

381
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,064
that I don't...

382
00:39:06,477 --> 00:39:08,069
have what it takes...

383
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:12,582
to make it in your world.

384
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,842
That's just his elite Harrington bullshit.

385
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,721
God. I've heard it all before. He's wrong.

386
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,649
He's wrong about you.

387
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,662
He's wrong about money and its power.

388
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,360
That's what makes the rich strong.

389
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,703
They do things because they can...

390
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,777
when everyone else does them
'cause they have to.

391
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,447
Money is the only real guarantee in life.

392
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,236
What's up, Richard?

393
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:14,536
I need for you not to fuck up here.

394
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,407
Meaning what?

395
00:40:18,182 --> 00:40:21,117
When I married into the Harringtons,
I thought I owned the world.

396
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,618
It didn't take long to realize
if you're not one of them...

397
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:25,245
you're not one of anything.

398
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:27,181
I know.

399
00:40:27,391 --> 00:40:30,792
Well, then, you also know the prenup
you're signing leaves you nothing...

400
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,419
if the marriage doesn't last.

401
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,355
They're hard work, the Harringtons.

402
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:39,425
A lot of time and energy invested
with a potential for no payday.

403
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:41,229
Unless...

404
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:45,701
we take advantage of what their position
in life has to offer by way of an opportunity.

405
00:40:49,713 --> 00:40:52,944
The Karasz leases are a big prize, David.

406
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,513
They could lead to better days...

407
00:40:58,489 --> 00:40:59,979
for both of us.

408
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,926
I found the address
that matches that cell phone number.

409
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:12,295
I was just saying
that your father was a bit concerned...

410
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:18,140
about, you know, how it looks when
you stay overnight at David's apartment.

411
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,802
God, you are so Republican.

412
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:22,973
That is horrendous.

413
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:26,878
It's Italian, from a top designer in Milan.

414
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,781
It's Versace on acid.

415
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:31,320
When did you become an expert
on wedding dresses?

416
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,490
Hey, honey, what's up?

417
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,961
Tish. No.

418
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,433
Calm down.

419
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:48,899
What about this one, dear?

420
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,097
They want $200,000.

421
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,976
This came from some Internet cafe in Buda.

422
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:59,410
We should tell the police. I mean,
now that you have his address, they...

423
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,950
Can't trust the police.

424
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,042
We need help, David.

425
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:07,146
You won't let me talk to anybody.
Please, let me just go to my father.

426
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:10,949
Richard was just in my office
begging me not to screw up the Karasz deal.

427
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,823
Knowing the way your father feels
about me...

428
00:42:14,465 --> 00:42:17,059
what do you think he would do
if he found out about this?

429
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,705
Did you know the Party talked to him...

430
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:29,108
about endorsing you
for a congressional seat?

431
00:42:33,584 --> 00:42:34,710
I'll pay them.

432
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,453
I'll drain my accounts. I have enough.

433
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:39,446
No, we'll just get it from my trust.

434
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,651
You can't start messing with your trust.
People will start asking questions.

435
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,252
We all got our shares after we turned 21.
No one would suspect a thing.

436
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:48,024
No. Let's just do it my way.

437
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,427
I have enough.

438
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:54,569
Do you even know this amusement park
that they want us to go to?

439
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:57,937
Yeah, it's been closed down for a while,
but there's no "us." I'm going alone.

440
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:59,168
No, you're not.

441
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,606
We're in this together.

442
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,938
It's past time.

443
00:43:35,245 --> 00:43:36,940
Maybe it's some sort of test.

444
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,416
You know,
see if we brought the police or anything.

445
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:48,024
- Why'd you bring your gun?
- Lf he doesn't come to us, we'll go to him.

446
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,752
- David, did you hear me?
- Yeah, I heard you.

447
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,829
- I brought it 'cause I thought I might need it.
- Well, I don't like it.

448
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,124
Neither do I.

449
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,705
Take it out very slowly.

450
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,332
Put it on the ground.

451
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,011
Good.

452
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,945
Is that the money?

453
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:17,379
Yes.

454
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,550
You. Bring it to me.

455
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,009
What about what we're buying with it?

456
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:42,903
You will get it.

457
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,844
- When?
- Soon.

458
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:49,183
Don't do anything stupid
and no one gets hurt!

459
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,180
David.

460
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,050
Just do as he says.

461
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,715
Just do what he says.

462
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:57,560
I'm walking out of here...

463
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,561
and you stay right where you are.

464
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,889
When I get to the car I let her go.

465
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:07,169
You do anything to stop me and she's dead.

466
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,375
David!

467
00:46:10,734 --> 00:46:12,361
- Tish.
- Here.

468
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:23,012
- You okay?
- I think so.

469
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:25,474
Where'd he go?

470
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:27,878
He's up there.

471
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,286
Give me what I fucking paid for!

472
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:43,525
Get down!

473
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:53,609
- Let him go!
- That's my life savings!

474
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:04,945
Oh, God.

475
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,347
Shit.

476
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:09,483
David!

477
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,131
I don't like this.

478
00:47:58,075 --> 00:47:59,372
Stay here.

479
00:49:22,926 --> 00:49:25,156
Look, it's him.

480
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,237
He's dead.

481
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:46,040
I'm scared, David.

482
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:51,251
This isn't about us fucking on some video.

483
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,025
It's murder.

484
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:06,297
We've gone from blackmail to murder.

485
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:10,566
There was this guy I did some work for
when I first started with the Embassy...

486
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:14,873
an American
who got himself into some trouble.

487
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:17,604
He might be able to help.

488
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,160
Her face looks familiar,
but it don't ring no bells.

489
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,165
How would we go about looking for her?

490
00:50:43,273 --> 00:50:46,071
If she's pussy for hire,
I'd start by hitting the streets.

491
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,474
Strip joints, fuck clubs, peepshows.

492
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:50,944
There are a couple of places
that might be able to help you.

493
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,209
In the meantime, I'll make a few calls.

494
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:57,915
- What was her name again?
- Risa. If that's her real name.

495
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:00,647
Are you sure you want to mess with this?

496
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,684
I'd appreciate it if you made the calls.

497
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:08,294
It's done.
No questions asked and no names.

498
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:09,897
I still owe you a big one.

499
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,184
Excuse me, you know her?

500
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:45,223
Her name is Risa.

501
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,327
Do you speak English?

502
00:52:21,872 --> 00:52:22,839
Do you know her?

503
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,445
I'm looking for someone.

504
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:37,416
If she's pussy for hire,
I'd start by hitting the streets.

505
00:52:37,521 --> 00:52:39,989
Strip joints, fuck clubs, peepshows.

506
00:52:49,966 --> 00:52:51,866
Are you sure you want to mess with this?

507
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:59,364
Do you know her? She has brown hair.

508
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,438
You waste my time.

509
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,630
Let's go.

510
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,762
There's fresh coffee.

511
00:54:41,869 --> 00:54:42,995
Got some.

512
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:46,631
Any luck?

513
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:49,934
No.

514
00:54:53,549 --> 00:54:55,244
Well, did you check my e-mail?

515
00:54:55,784 --> 00:54:56,772
Nothing.

516
00:55:10,399 --> 00:55:11,868
How'd it make you feel?

517
00:55:13,237 --> 00:55:14,602
What do you mean?

518
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:20,936
The strippers, the clubs, the sex,
how'd it make you feel?

519
00:55:25,716 --> 00:55:26,944
Did you get...

520
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,013
You know?

521
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:31,680
Did you?

522
00:55:35,294 --> 00:55:36,852
Some of it repulsed me...

523
00:55:39,465 --> 00:55:40,658
but some of it...

524
00:55:45,038 --> 00:55:47,063
Some of it made me feel...

525
00:55:51,579 --> 00:55:52,636
Yes?

526
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,175
Are you David Huxley?

527
00:55:56,283 --> 00:55:57,615
Yes. Why?

528
00:55:58,152 --> 00:56:00,781
Detective Kovacs, Budapest Police.

529
00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:04,288
Do you know a man named Josef Klim?

530
00:56:05,759 --> 00:56:06,784
Sort of.

531
00:56:07,195 --> 00:56:08,628
Do you mind if I come in?

532
00:56:09,064 --> 00:56:10,896
Please, come in.

533
00:56:11,867 --> 00:56:14,392
What do you mean, "sort of"?

534
00:56:14,502 --> 00:56:17,166
We met him at a resort that we stayed at.

535
00:56:17,506 --> 00:56:18,939
- The Alhambra?
- Yes.

536
00:56:19,475 --> 00:56:23,070
- Detective, this is my fiancee.
- Oh, Miss Harrington.

537
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:26,047
I have seen pictures of you in the papers,
with your father.

538
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:29,080
Detective, please have a seat.

539
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:32,884
It was you who made the reservation, yes?

540
00:56:34,425 --> 00:56:35,619
Yes.

541
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,790
Have either of you
had contact with Mr. Klim...

542
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,727
since you stayed at the Alhambra?

543
00:56:40,832 --> 00:56:41,821
No.

544
00:56:43,201 --> 00:56:46,330
Detective, what is this about?

545
00:56:47,773 --> 00:56:50,367
Mr. Klim was found murdered yesterday.

546
00:56:51,644 --> 00:56:52,975
Oh, my God.

547
00:56:55,748 --> 00:56:58,650
Is this your business card, Mr. Huxley?

548
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:06,916
Yes. Yes, it is.

549
00:57:07,228 --> 00:57:09,423
A woman at the company
that last employed Mr. Klim...

550
00:57:09,529 --> 00:57:12,124
says you left it, inquiring about him.

551
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,165
Yes, that's correct.

552
00:57:15,569 --> 00:57:16,593
Why?

553
00:57:18,439 --> 00:57:20,806
He had an American friend...

554
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:23,275
that needed help.

555
00:57:23,979 --> 00:57:25,606
What kind of help?

556
00:57:26,014 --> 00:57:27,982
It had to do with a visa.

557
00:57:28,984 --> 00:57:30,919
I told him that when I got back
to the office...

558
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,284
that I'd have my secretary call, and she did...

559
00:57:33,389 --> 00:57:36,187
and she found out that
he was no longer employed at the baths.

560
00:57:36,292 --> 00:57:39,990
Three nights ago somebody
broke into a room at the Alhambra.

561
00:57:40,831 --> 00:57:42,821
There was some vandalism...

562
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:46,031
and, by coincidence, the same night...

563
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:48,196
the manager says
a man stopped in the office...

564
00:57:48,305 --> 00:57:50,900
and asked about Josef Klim...

565
00:57:55,879 --> 00:57:57,279
an American man.

566
00:57:57,817 --> 00:58:01,684
Her description sounds a little bit like you,
Mr. Huxley.

567
00:58:01,886 --> 00:58:03,878
I assure you, it wasn't me.

568
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:06,982
We've only been there that one time.

569
00:58:11,731 --> 00:58:15,133
I guess a lot of people
look like a lot of people, yes?

570
00:58:15,235 --> 00:58:17,726
Well, in any case, it appears the vandalism...

571
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:22,104
involved in the removal of a camera
that was hidden in a wall of the room.

572
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,440
I think Josef Klim...

573
00:58:24,846 --> 00:58:29,306
was taping unsuspecting guests
and making pornography.

574
00:58:32,053 --> 00:58:34,716
Are you saying he was doing that to us?

575
00:58:34,956 --> 00:58:37,824
It was in the room you stayed in.
I checked the reservation.

576
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,760
Klim was in jail in Berlin for extortion.

577
00:58:40,863 --> 00:58:43,025
He threatened to expose a man and woman
he had taped...

578
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:44,430
if they didn't pay him.

579
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:48,395
So I've been putting two and two together...

580
00:58:48,504 --> 00:58:50,700
and I come up with a theory.

581
00:58:51,474 --> 00:58:52,634
And what's that?

582
00:58:53,711 --> 00:58:57,441
Maybe he tried his little trick
on someone at the Alhambra, yes?

583
00:58:57,547 --> 00:59:00,015
But this time, how do you say...

584
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:02,280
it backfired on him.

585
00:59:02,586 --> 00:59:05,521
And you think they killed him?

586
00:59:06,023 --> 00:59:08,617
In my business, you got many kind of cases.

587
00:59:08,726 --> 00:59:11,788
Some ones come with answers,
some are only questions.

588
00:59:12,731 --> 00:59:15,462
This one is difficult.

589
00:59:17,135 --> 00:59:19,035
Nothing seems as it is.

590
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:28,410
This is my cell phone and pager.

591
00:59:28,515 --> 00:59:32,006
Please, call me if anything
come to your mind about Mr. Klim...

592
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,843
anything at all.

593
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:36,816
Hurt your hand, did you?

594
00:59:39,327 --> 00:59:41,693
I cut it chopping tomatoes.

595
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,021
I hate that.

596
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:46,931
Well, thank you, again.

597
01:00:02,052 --> 01:00:03,815
We just lied to the police.

598
01:00:03,919 --> 01:00:06,184
Did you want me to tell him the truth?

599
01:00:06,723 --> 01:00:08,987
He thinks whoever was there killed that man.

600
01:00:09,092 --> 01:00:10,116
Hello?

601
01:00:10,227 --> 01:00:12,718
It's me. Time to go to RealDoll. Com.

602
01:00:12,829 --> 01:00:14,730
RealDoll. Com?

603
01:00:14,832 --> 01:00:17,232
- Talk to you later.
- Okay.

604
01:00:18,035 --> 01:00:19,366
Who was it?

605
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:20,869
It was the guy from the sex shop.

606
01:00:20,972 --> 01:00:22,735
- What'd he want?
- Told me to go to this website.

607
01:00:24,209 --> 01:00:25,836
RealDoll...

608
01:00:26,945 --> 01:00:28,242
. com

609
01:00:31,049 --> 01:00:33,176
"The silicone dolls."

610
01:00:41,761 --> 01:00:43,093
That's her.

611
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,594
They're here in Budapest.

612
01:00:50,436 --> 01:00:53,964
Just trying to make a few quid on the EU,
so I don't want no trouble, understand?

613
01:00:54,074 --> 01:00:56,269
We bring birds in, they model,
we make the molds.

614
01:00:56,377 --> 01:00:57,742
I couldn't give two fucks who they are.

615
01:00:57,845 --> 01:00:59,642
Pay them a couple notes,
they're on their way.

616
01:00:59,748 --> 01:01:01,011
We just want to talk to the people...

617
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:03,107
Look, leave it out, mate.
I don't want to know.

618
01:01:08,256 --> 01:01:09,588
Which one is she?

619
01:01:10,226 --> 01:01:11,250
Nika.

620
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,158
They're all just rubber dollies to me, love.
You point her out, eh?

621
01:01:17,733 --> 01:01:19,167
Is that her?

622
01:01:20,971 --> 01:01:21,960
No.

623
01:01:31,549 --> 01:01:32,982
How about that beauty?

624
01:01:34,585 --> 01:01:35,609
No.

625
01:01:42,661 --> 01:01:43,684
That's her.

626
01:01:44,462 --> 01:01:46,863
Yeah. Bleeding pain in the ass, that one.

627
01:01:46,966 --> 01:01:48,832
Toe-rag wanted paying well over the odds.

628
01:01:48,934 --> 01:01:50,561
Take it easy, boys, eh?

629
01:01:50,669 --> 01:01:53,194
Only reason I used her was
'cause Gabor brought her in.

630
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,331
- Gabor?
- Yeah, skin man. Snaps all our layouts.

631
01:01:56,443 --> 01:01:59,810
Wanted to get his end away with her
somewhat rotten, so I tossed him a bone.

632
01:01:59,913 --> 01:02:01,744
Do you know
where we could find this Gabor?

633
01:02:01,848 --> 01:02:04,316
I could have a look-see,
try and rustle up a number.

634
01:02:04,417 --> 01:02:05,544
Have a gander.

635
01:02:05,653 --> 01:02:08,053
Something tickles your fancy,
I'll sort you out.

636
01:02:10,424 --> 01:02:14,191
Gabor wants me to ask
if you work for police...

637
01:02:14,296 --> 01:02:17,629
or have any affiliation
with law enforcement?

638
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:18,722
No.

639
01:02:21,536 --> 01:02:24,438
You look familiar to me.

640
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:28,911
Have you ever done any print modeling?

641
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:30,836
No.

642
01:02:34,151 --> 01:02:35,675
Hardcore?

643
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:37,909
No.

644
01:02:38,856 --> 01:02:41,381
I know you from somewhere.

645
01:02:43,995 --> 01:02:45,859
Here's the Americans, Gabor.

646
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:00,845
- Come join us.
- You, too.

647
01:03:05,451 --> 01:03:06,577
Jesus.

648
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:21,363
- So why you looking for Risa?
- We want to talk to her.

649
01:03:21,469 --> 01:03:23,460
- Business?
- In a way.

650
01:03:24,906 --> 01:03:29,173
Let me tell you something.
That bitch is nothing but bad business.

651
01:03:29,777 --> 01:03:31,302
Well, have you seen her recently?

652
01:03:31,412 --> 01:03:34,143
I haven't seen her in months,
and I don't expect to.

653
01:03:34,249 --> 01:03:35,510
She owes me money.

654
01:03:35,616 --> 01:03:37,141
Do you know where we can find her?

655
01:03:37,252 --> 01:03:40,278
Last I heard
she was working for Gorman Bellec...

656
01:03:40,856 --> 01:03:43,348
but you don't want to mess with him.

657
01:03:43,759 --> 01:03:46,160
- Why not?
- He runs Dekan...

658
01:03:46,863 --> 01:03:48,797
for the Russian mafia.

659
01:03:49,365 --> 01:03:52,267
- What is that?
- Dekan. Entertainment.

660
01:03:52,837 --> 01:03:54,930
Clubs, films.

661
01:03:57,441 --> 01:04:01,502
You want to be in the fuck business?
I can make you look really good.

662
01:04:01,912 --> 01:04:04,882
Thanks for the vote of confidence,
but I don't think so.

663
01:04:05,083 --> 01:04:08,246
If we wanted to talk to this Gorman Bellec,
how do we go about doing that?

664
01:04:08,353 --> 01:04:11,186
See Greta.
She will tell you where to find him...

665
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:14,048
but I'll give you a piece of advice.

666
01:04:14,626 --> 01:04:17,060
You don't exist
unless you have something...

667
01:04:17,697 --> 01:04:19,324
Gorman Bellec needs.

668
01:04:30,244 --> 01:04:33,009
- What happened?
- I couldn't get to see him.

669
01:04:33,514 --> 01:04:36,176
One of his goons said
he was auditioning women for his club.

670
01:04:36,284 --> 01:04:39,481
- Well, did you ask him about Risa?
- He didn't know her.

671
01:04:44,192 --> 01:04:46,387
What if it all ended with Josef Klim's death?

672
01:04:46,494 --> 01:04:48,292
We haven't got the original tapes.

673
01:04:49,632 --> 01:04:52,123
We have to find Risa and make a deal.

674
01:04:57,406 --> 01:05:00,843
Well, then let me take a shot at Mr. Bellec.

675
01:05:01,711 --> 01:05:05,544
You said he was auditioning dancers,
so I'll audition.

676
01:05:05,649 --> 01:05:07,674
What, you're out of your mind?
You're not doing that.

677
01:05:07,784 --> 01:05:11,276
It's not exactly at the top of my list
of things I want to do at the moment...

678
01:05:11,389 --> 01:05:13,357
but it might be the only way
we can find Risa.

679
01:05:13,457 --> 01:05:14,856
No. We'll think of something else.

680
01:05:14,959 --> 01:05:16,119
What, David?

681
01:05:19,331 --> 01:05:21,424
I'll be careful, I promise.

682
01:05:23,067 --> 01:05:24,330
I'm going with you.

683
01:05:32,544 --> 01:05:34,307
I told you, he's busy...

684
01:05:34,413 --> 01:05:36,473
and we don't open for another two hours.

685
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:43,287
I'm here to audition. He's my manager.

686
01:05:52,867 --> 01:05:55,234
There's another one. She's American.

687
01:05:56,171 --> 01:05:57,195
Okay.

688
01:05:58,406 --> 01:06:00,931
Down the back hall. First door on the left.

689
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,705
Please don't insult my intelligence.

690
01:06:06,815 --> 01:06:11,549
We already shipped you 30,000 units.
I haven't even seen a single forint, yet.

691
01:06:14,391 --> 01:06:16,188
If I don't see some money...

692
01:06:16,859 --> 01:06:20,625
or hear a damn good excuse by Friday,
you know what, my friend?

693
01:06:21,264 --> 01:06:23,893
I will set the dogs loose, you understand?

694
01:06:26,237 --> 01:06:27,363
Good.

695
01:06:32,911 --> 01:06:34,379
What is your name?

696
01:06:34,913 --> 01:06:36,210
Tish.

697
01:06:38,383 --> 01:06:39,749
What are you?

698
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:42,280
Husband? Boyfriend?

699
01:06:42,755 --> 01:06:43,847
Manager.

700
01:06:45,991 --> 01:06:47,185
So, Tish...

701
01:06:48,494 --> 01:06:49,894
what do you do?

702
01:06:51,031 --> 01:06:54,523
You eat pussy, suck cock, take it in the ass?
What is your specialty?

703
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:58,396
- I thought you were auditioning dancers.
- I am.

704
01:06:58,706 --> 01:07:01,037
I also do fuck film, print work.

705
01:07:02,276 --> 01:07:05,404
- You ever do any of that?
- We thought she'd start off dancing.

706
01:07:07,282 --> 01:07:08,441
You are wasting my time.

707
01:07:08,684 --> 01:07:12,950
Please, I want to start somewhere,
and people say you're the best.

708
01:07:15,324 --> 01:07:16,689
What people?

709
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:19,859
This girl I know. Risa.

710
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:23,559
If you are talking about the Risa
I think you are talking about...

711
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:26,066
you two can get your asses out of here
right now...

712
01:07:26,169 --> 01:07:28,967
and you tell her, if I ever see her again...

713
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:31,700
I kill her.

714
01:07:37,848 --> 01:07:39,076
I want a job.

715
01:07:41,418 --> 01:07:43,750
You won't be disappointed, I promise.

716
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:48,622
Everybody want to be porn star.

717
01:07:51,863 --> 01:07:53,024
Okay.

718
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:55,733
Let's see what you look like.

719
01:08:07,013 --> 01:08:08,810
Take off your clothes.

720
01:08:34,009 --> 01:08:35,977
No, get it all off.

721
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,173
Tish.

722
01:08:42,419 --> 01:08:43,716
It's okay.

723
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:46,850
You sure?

724
01:09:23,629 --> 01:09:25,495
You have a fresh look.

725
01:09:26,433 --> 01:09:27,662
I like that.

726
01:09:31,605 --> 01:09:33,334
You sure you're up to this?

727
01:09:34,476 --> 01:09:36,103
There's only one way to find out.

728
01:09:55,932 --> 01:09:57,559
You seen her, that's enough.

729
01:09:57,667 --> 01:09:59,862
Your bitch here better let me touch her.

730
01:10:01,237 --> 01:10:05,004
If she doesn't,
I might start to think that you two are cops.

731
01:10:05,842 --> 01:10:07,140
We're not.

732
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:10,805
Like you said...

733
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:14,441
there is only one way to find out.

734
01:10:35,508 --> 01:10:37,499
You want to play, you pay.

735
01:10:38,179 --> 01:10:39,907
She wants a job first.

736
01:10:42,148 --> 01:10:43,878
Put your clothes on.

737
01:10:46,987 --> 01:10:49,684
Don't say it. I mean, don't say a word.

738
01:11:06,142 --> 01:11:08,838
I'm not gonna let you dance
in some strip club.

739
01:11:09,879 --> 01:11:12,040
I am if it means we find her.

740
01:11:12,148 --> 01:11:16,518
I can't believe that I let you take
your clothes off in front of that piece of shit.

741
01:11:16,754 --> 01:11:20,484
We are in big trouble here.
We lied to the police.

742
01:11:24,128 --> 01:11:26,722
I thought about what you said,
and you're right.

743
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:29,923
This could destroy you.

744
01:11:31,269 --> 01:11:33,238
I don't care about that, anymore.

745
01:11:35,774 --> 01:11:36,968
Yes, you do.

746
01:11:39,311 --> 01:11:40,505
So do I...

747
01:11:42,882 --> 01:11:46,249
but this isn't about just us.

748
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:53,986
No matter what he says or does,
I know my father loves me.

749
01:11:57,164 --> 01:11:59,098
Everything I've ever wanted in my life...

750
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:03,068
any trouble I've gotten into,
he's been there to bail me out.

751
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:09,100
He is at the top of the list for a Supreme
Court nomination and this could kill it.

752
01:12:13,849 --> 01:12:15,578
I won't let that happen.

753
01:12:27,063 --> 01:12:29,862
- Would there be anything else?
- No, we're fine, thanks.

754
01:12:30,701 --> 01:12:32,168
Where'd you all end up last night?

755
01:12:32,303 --> 01:12:35,898
Well, after being stood up by my sister...

756
01:12:36,006 --> 01:12:39,408
I landed in a Turkish bath
that proved to be quite exhilarating.

757
01:12:40,111 --> 01:12:41,237
Looks like it.

758
01:12:41,346 --> 01:12:44,247
So, David,
are we starting to depose on Monday?

759
01:12:45,517 --> 01:12:47,849
Actually, I'm running a little behind.

760
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:49,481
What's a little?

761
01:12:49,888 --> 01:12:51,082
A day, maybe two.

762
01:12:51,189 --> 01:12:53,681
- You remember what I said...
- I'm well aware of the time crunch.

763
01:12:53,792 --> 01:12:56,091
- Lf the depositions don't get done...
- I know, Richard. I know.

764
01:12:56,196 --> 01:12:59,097
Boys, boys, boys.
My head's about to explode.

765
01:12:59,565 --> 01:13:01,726
- There's a call for you, Mr. Kraft.
- Thanks.

766
01:13:03,035 --> 01:13:04,196
Excuse me.

767
01:13:04,805 --> 01:13:08,071
The sunlight here is killing me.
Let's go to the bar, David.

768
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:10,473
Sorry, Perry. I got to get home.

769
01:13:13,814 --> 01:13:16,750
- Thank you for lunch.
- Our pleasure, always.

770
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:18,478
I'll call you this afternoon.

771
01:13:21,255 --> 01:13:22,347
Bye.

772
01:13:23,992 --> 01:13:26,483
So what's going on?

773
01:13:28,597 --> 01:13:29,586
What do you mean?

774
01:13:29,732 --> 01:13:33,499
I mean,
you both look like death warmed over.

775
01:13:35,638 --> 01:13:37,435
And there's something wrong, isn't there?

776
01:13:39,376 --> 01:13:41,675
There's nothing wrong, Lynn.

777
01:13:43,414 --> 01:13:45,404
Are you and David having problems?

778
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:48,441
It's nothing major, just...

779
01:13:55,326 --> 01:13:56,350
a wedding.

780
01:13:57,295 --> 01:14:01,095
I mean, and the whole idea
of marriage and... You know.

781
01:14:01,466 --> 01:14:03,491
Why don't you guys join us
for dinner tonight?

782
01:14:03,969 --> 01:14:07,166
I promise I'll make Richard
lay off the business stuff.

783
01:14:08,874 --> 01:14:10,433
We've already made other plans.

784
01:14:13,813 --> 01:14:15,042
Where are you going?

785
01:14:17,550 --> 01:14:18,745
Dancing.

786
01:14:25,325 --> 01:14:27,054
Are you sure you want to do this?

787
01:14:28,663 --> 01:14:30,096
My other choice being?

788
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:44,846
It's 20,000 forints.

789
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:47,948
- She's starting work here today.
- Good for her...

790
01:14:48,051 --> 01:14:50,450
but it's still 20,000 forints for you to watch.

791
01:15:14,213 --> 01:15:15,771
You're not doing this.

792
01:15:15,981 --> 01:15:17,881
So you showed up, did you?

793
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:26,181
I didn't exactly expect this.

794
01:15:27,193 --> 01:15:29,024
You want a job or not?

795
01:15:38,105 --> 01:15:39,470
You go with her.

796
01:15:46,147 --> 01:15:47,205
Tish.

797
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:50,446
She'll be just fine, manager.

798
01:15:56,292 --> 01:15:57,553
Relax.

799
01:15:59,060 --> 01:16:00,791
Go get yourself a drink.

800
01:16:04,635 --> 01:16:06,101
First time, huh?

801
01:16:06,502 --> 01:16:07,560
You can tell?

802
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:09,969
You'll do fine. Just think money.

803
01:16:17,682 --> 01:16:20,047
Be nice to her. She's a new girl.

804
01:16:45,712 --> 01:16:47,407
It's not as hard as it looks.

805
01:16:50,016 --> 01:16:52,450
My name's Deedee. I'm from Brighton.

806
01:16:53,788 --> 01:16:56,780
Tish. I'm from California.

807
01:16:57,158 --> 01:16:59,524
Oh, God, I love it there!

808
01:16:59,627 --> 01:17:02,926
I used to dance at the Star Strip
in Beverly Hills. Do you know it?

809
01:17:03,264 --> 01:17:04,425
No...

810
01:17:06,134 --> 01:17:08,534
but I know a girl who might've worked here.

811
01:17:09,938 --> 01:17:13,102
- Risa. Do you know her?
- Fucking crackhead!

812
01:17:13,576 --> 01:17:15,066
Not a friend of yours, I hope?

813
01:17:15,278 --> 01:17:17,371
No. I hung out with her once.

814
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:19,448
Once is all you can take.

815
01:17:19,849 --> 01:17:21,008
You know her, too?

816
01:17:21,116 --> 01:17:24,849
I hate her,
me and every other bitch in this place.

817
01:17:25,322 --> 01:17:26,948
Then she does work here?

818
01:17:27,056 --> 01:17:30,321
Until Gorman told her not to show her ass
around here anymore.

819
01:17:33,364 --> 01:17:37,460
Come on, new girl.
I have something better for you.

820
01:17:38,536 --> 01:17:40,127
Why don't you let her start on the floor?

821
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:43,765
Why don't you all get your asses out there
and let me run my business?

822
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:22,777
Where are we going?

823
01:18:23,318 --> 01:18:27,415
You want to be in porn business?
I am putting you in porn business.

824
01:18:43,074 --> 01:18:45,736
Streaming video. Live on the Internet.

825
01:18:47,079 --> 01:18:49,808
The girls will get you through it. Just...

826
01:18:50,715 --> 01:18:54,174
you know, do what comes naturally.

827
01:19:00,425 --> 01:19:02,620
Let's do something with that hair of yours.

828
01:19:03,329 --> 01:19:06,526
- What?
- Your hair. I do something with it.

829
01:19:07,834 --> 01:19:10,301
Maybe put it up? What do you think?

830
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:14,465
Look, this is my first time...

831
01:19:14,575 --> 01:19:16,940
and I'm a little nervous.

832
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:20,205
- I gotta pee.
- It's down the hall.

833
01:19:20,314 --> 01:19:21,373
Okay.

834
01:20:10,235 --> 01:20:11,930
There's no way in hell...

835
01:20:16,942 --> 01:20:19,706
- What are you doing?
- Let's get out of here.

836
01:20:20,213 --> 01:20:22,545
- Where do you think you're going?
- She's leaving.

837
01:20:22,648 --> 01:20:24,081
I wasn't talking to you.

838
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:28,578
This is a mistake.
I mean, I thought I could do it, but I can't.

839
01:20:28,722 --> 01:20:31,350
- Let's take a little walk.
- Sounds great.

840
01:20:31,826 --> 01:20:35,024
I was not talking to you, asshole.

841
01:20:40,467 --> 01:20:43,368
David! Come on! Come on! David!

842
01:21:01,858 --> 01:21:04,292
I put the fear of God in you, did I?

843
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,490
I was so close.

844
01:21:11,602 --> 01:21:15,095
All of the girls, they knew who she was,
but I couldn't go through with it.

845
01:21:15,206 --> 01:21:17,731
I'm sorry, David, I couldn't do it and I just...

846
01:21:17,909 --> 01:21:19,899
- What is this?
- Her address.

847
01:21:21,614 --> 01:21:23,946
- Where'd you get it?
- From a naked lady.

848
01:22:01,924 --> 01:22:04,017
- I'll stay here.
- All right.

849
01:22:22,012 --> 01:22:24,002
Tish, come here.

850
01:23:01,154 --> 01:23:02,280
David.

851
01:23:03,024 --> 01:23:04,218
In here.

852
01:23:28,317 --> 01:23:30,980
What if it has something to do with us?

853
01:23:34,124 --> 01:23:37,184
Why would someone be killing them
because of us?

854
01:23:45,269 --> 01:23:46,736
I'm so scared.

855
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:51,740
Come here.

856
01:23:58,683 --> 01:24:01,551
If they were doing the same thing
to someone else...

857
01:24:02,755 --> 01:24:06,715
and that someone else
decided to put an end to it...

858
01:24:09,296 --> 01:24:10,922
maybe it's over.

859
01:24:12,166 --> 01:24:14,657
Maybe we have nothing to worry about.

860
01:24:20,307 --> 01:24:22,104
Do you really believe that?

861
01:24:24,145 --> 01:24:25,578
As far as we know...

862
01:24:26,681 --> 01:24:30,082
the only two people who know about us
or anything that happened...

863
01:24:31,586 --> 01:24:32,814
are dead.

864
01:24:35,758 --> 01:24:37,749
But there's the policeman.

865
01:24:38,727 --> 01:24:42,664
I mean, he suspects something, and now
the girl's dead. What if he puts it together?

866
01:24:44,468 --> 01:24:46,196
He can't connect us.

867
01:24:48,905 --> 01:24:51,874
The woman at the Alhambra, she ID'd you.

868
01:24:54,077 --> 01:24:56,638
She ID'd someone that looked like me.

869
01:25:15,934 --> 01:25:17,231
Hello?

870
01:25:17,736 --> 01:25:21,834
The game is back on,
but now the price is $1 million.

871
01:25:22,876 --> 01:25:26,141
Check your e-mail. See you soon.

872
01:25:33,621 --> 01:25:37,148
How the hell are we gonna get
$800,000 by tonight?

873
01:25:38,994 --> 01:25:43,055
When Lynn needed cash for her place here,
she used her diplomatic immunity.

874
01:25:43,165 --> 01:25:46,828
Had it wired from our Swiss bank.
It only took a few hours.

875
01:25:46,969 --> 01:25:48,731
That'll draw attention.

876
01:25:48,838 --> 01:25:50,430
It won't, trust me.

877
01:25:53,775 --> 01:25:56,177
Is it going to stop once we pay them?

878
01:26:02,285 --> 01:26:04,311
David, what do you want to do?

879
01:26:09,459 --> 01:26:11,393
That kind of money takes me out of it.

880
01:26:11,496 --> 01:26:14,693
It's not about the money.
What's mine is yours and yours is mine.

881
01:26:14,799 --> 01:26:16,232
What do you want to do?

882
01:26:19,738 --> 01:26:22,001
Maybe it's time to get some help...

883
01:26:23,842 --> 01:26:25,332
but if we do...

884
01:26:27,913 --> 01:26:30,040
we can kiss everything goodbye.

885
01:26:40,726 --> 01:26:42,059
Got it.

886
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:45,588
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

887
01:26:50,204 --> 01:26:51,865
I don't see anyone.

888
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:55,041
They're probably inside...

889
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:58,743
watching us.

890
01:26:59,749 --> 01:27:01,944
They could just take the money and kill us.

891
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:05,645
That's why you gotta stay in the car,
in case something goes wrong.

892
01:27:17,166 --> 01:27:18,930
I owe you everything.

893
01:27:20,571 --> 01:27:23,904
Everything I am, everything I'll ever be...

894
01:27:24,808 --> 01:27:28,245
and if it takes me my entire life,
I will pay you back.

895
01:27:28,346 --> 01:27:32,009
And I just don't mean the money.
I mean what you do for me...

896
01:27:33,551 --> 01:27:35,109
what you make me.

897
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:39,854
Without you I'm just a dreamer...

898
01:27:40,993 --> 01:27:42,459
but with you...

899
01:27:44,430 --> 01:27:47,297
there's not a thing in this world
that I can't do.

900
01:27:57,878 --> 01:28:00,176
No. No guns.

901
01:28:00,647 --> 01:28:03,014
For you, in case something happens.

902
01:28:03,116 --> 01:28:05,176
I've never fired a gun in my entire life.

903
01:28:05,287 --> 01:28:09,780
Flip off the safety,
you point, and you pull the trigger.

904
01:28:13,595 --> 01:28:16,325
But nothing's gonna happen
if you just go in there...

905
01:28:16,432 --> 01:28:18,866
and you give them the money,
and you get out.

906
01:28:19,034 --> 01:28:21,025
- I will.
- Swear it.

907
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:22,665
I swear.

908
01:28:24,741 --> 01:28:26,072
I love you.

909
01:28:47,032 --> 01:28:47,998
Oh, God.

910
01:29:08,922 --> 01:29:10,412
They said no police!

911
01:29:10,524 --> 01:29:13,618
You are in a lot of trouble, Miss Harrington.
People are dead.

912
01:29:13,727 --> 01:29:15,285
We had nothing to do with that!

913
01:29:15,396 --> 01:29:18,560
I know, but if you want to see Mr. Huxley
come out of there alive...

914
01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:21,157
I recommend you let me handle this, yes?

915
01:29:26,942 --> 01:29:28,136
Yes.

916
01:30:46,229 --> 01:30:47,423
Oh, fuck.

917
01:30:48,096 --> 01:30:50,531
You fucked up. We have David.

918
01:30:50,633 --> 01:30:52,624
No, please don't hurt him!

919
01:30:52,802 --> 01:30:55,134
He's a dead man. I said no police.

920
01:30:55,238 --> 01:30:58,834
We didn't know. He must have followed us.
We didn't know.

921
01:30:59,409 --> 01:31:01,309
Look, I'll do anything.

922
01:31:01,979 --> 01:31:04,243
I will give you anything.

923
01:31:04,348 --> 01:31:07,546
I want $5 million.

924
01:31:07,652 --> 01:31:08,812
What?

925
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:12,947
The price for the tapes is $1 million.
The price for his life is $4 million.

926
01:31:13,057 --> 01:31:17,256
That is a total of $5 million.
If you go to the police, he's dead.

927
01:31:17,362 --> 01:31:18,830
No, please.

928
01:31:18,931 --> 01:31:20,990
We clean up the mess with the cop.

929
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:25,570
Get out of there
and no fucking around this time.

930
01:31:25,738 --> 01:31:28,674
Check your e-mail. Save his life.

931
01:31:51,366 --> 01:31:56,167
Transfer the agreed-upon funds
into account number 2J4480...

932
01:31:56,271 --> 01:31:58,171
Grand Cayman Title and Trust.

933
01:31:58,307 --> 01:32:01,708
The money will be immediately transferred
to another closed account...

934
01:32:01,811 --> 01:32:04,075
within 30 seconds of the initial wire.

935
01:32:04,180 --> 01:32:08,048
Upon verification,
we will release David's location of bondage.

936
01:32:08,251 --> 01:32:12,416
The slightest variation from these
instructions and we will leave him to die.

937
01:32:21,599 --> 01:32:24,592
Money transfers are much safer,
Miss Harrington.

938
01:32:24,702 --> 01:32:28,638
I must say, I was quite concerned
about your security last time.

939
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:30,965
I had no choice.

940
01:32:31,077 --> 01:32:33,671
And you say this is a land investment?

941
01:32:33,913 --> 01:32:35,005
In the Caribbean.

942
01:32:35,114 --> 01:32:37,411
- Where, might I ask?
- St. John's.

943
01:32:38,417 --> 01:32:41,011
One of my favorite islands.
Although Barbados has...

944
01:32:41,121 --> 01:32:44,557
I'm sorry.
How long do the money transfers take?

945
01:32:44,657 --> 01:32:46,648
It's probably done by now.

946
01:32:46,926 --> 01:32:49,225
- Great. Thank you.
- My pleasure.

947
01:32:52,666 --> 01:32:53,690
Hello.

948
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:57,201
You can find him and the tapes
at Elek Street, Number 10, in the basement.

949
01:32:57,304 --> 01:32:59,398
I still would not alert the police.

950
01:32:59,507 --> 01:33:03,273
There will be questions. It could get
very nasty for you and your family.

951
01:33:03,444 --> 01:33:07,108
Do not dally.
I'm not really sure how much air he has left.

952
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:12,053
Damn it.

953
01:33:16,459 --> 01:33:18,154
Come on, God damn it.

954
01:33:24,467 --> 01:33:25,594
Yeah?

955
01:33:25,702 --> 01:33:30,299
There's no Alex or Alec Street,
but there is one called Elek, spelled E-L-E-K.

956
01:33:30,408 --> 01:33:31,840
Okay. How do I get there?

957
01:33:31,941 --> 01:33:34,068
Take the Freedom Bridge
onto the Buda side.

958
01:33:34,177 --> 01:33:37,705
It's right past the Gellert Hotel,
right around Freedom Square.

959
01:33:38,016 --> 01:33:39,175
I got it.

960
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:48,521
Oh, God!

961
01:33:58,671 --> 01:34:00,070
What's up, Sister?

962
01:34:00,873 --> 01:34:02,239
Where are you?

963
01:34:04,445 --> 01:34:06,106
Taking in the sights with a friend.

964
01:34:06,213 --> 01:34:07,202
Where?

965
01:34:07,314 --> 01:34:10,112
Easy. Since you're in no hurry
to take care of wedding business...

966
01:34:10,217 --> 01:34:12,584
I decided to do some sightseeing.

967
01:34:14,823 --> 01:34:15,915
Fuck!

968
01:34:47,692 --> 01:34:49,683
- Hello?
- Where the hell are you?

969
01:34:49,794 --> 01:34:52,592
I just had brunch at the Women's Club.
Where are you?

970
01:34:52,797 --> 01:34:54,560
- I need some help!
- What?

971
01:34:54,665 --> 01:34:56,793
I need some fucking help, Lynn!

972
01:34:57,169 --> 01:34:58,158
Lynn!

973
01:34:58,270 --> 01:35:00,761
I can't hear you. You're breaking up.

974
01:35:02,307 --> 01:35:03,295
Lynn!

975
01:35:46,122 --> 01:35:48,488
Do you know where Elek Street is?

976
01:35:59,069 --> 01:36:01,698
Elek Street? Where is...

977
01:36:03,541 --> 01:36:05,099
- Elek?
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

978
01:36:46,187 --> 01:36:48,315
Of course. Are you okay?

979
01:36:48,423 --> 01:36:50,482
- Is this 10?
- 10?

980
01:36:50,592 --> 01:36:52,116
- Number 10!
- 10, yes.

981
01:36:52,227 --> 01:36:53,251
- Elek Street!
- Yes.

982
01:36:53,362 --> 01:36:56,298
- You have a basement?
- A basement. Yes, why?

983
01:36:56,399 --> 01:36:58,230
Where's your fucking basement?

984
01:36:58,333 --> 01:37:02,430
There is nothing down there.
No one has used it for years.

985
01:37:02,538 --> 01:37:05,735
- There's a man down here.
- No, there's no man.

986
01:37:05,910 --> 01:37:08,207
- He's dying! Please.
- What?

987
01:37:08,312 --> 01:37:09,438
David!

988
01:37:09,613 --> 01:37:11,637
What do you mean a man is dying here?

989
01:37:11,749 --> 01:37:12,875
David!

990
01:37:12,983 --> 01:37:15,178
You better get out of here or...

991
01:37:19,523 --> 01:37:21,081
How can this be?

992
01:37:26,631 --> 01:37:29,031
I do not know how this has happened.

993
01:37:29,134 --> 01:37:32,592
I swear to God. I will call the police.

994
01:37:32,704 --> 01:37:35,105
No! No police.

995
01:37:39,712 --> 01:37:41,373
How do I take this off?

996
01:37:46,353 --> 01:37:47,615
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

997
01:38:00,068 --> 01:38:01,934
Look at me. Look at me.

998
01:38:24,195 --> 01:38:26,322
When are you and David
going on a honeymoon?

999
01:38:26,430 --> 01:38:28,694
In the spring,
when the new Ambassador and her staff...

1000
01:38:28,799 --> 01:38:30,198
take over for Daddy and the others.

1001
01:38:30,301 --> 01:38:31,768
Are you still up for shopping tomorrow?

1002
01:38:31,869 --> 01:38:34,997
Absolutely.
I plan on doing heavy damage all day.

1003
01:38:35,306 --> 01:38:36,637
That's my girls.

1004
01:38:43,448 --> 01:38:47,215
May I have your attention, please?
I would like to propose a toast.

1005
01:38:49,022 --> 01:38:53,823
To Christmas, good friends, the New Year...

1006
01:38:55,496 --> 01:38:57,430
and to David and Richard...

1007
01:38:58,031 --> 01:38:59,761
and a job well done.

1008
01:38:59,866 --> 01:39:01,095
Hear, hear.

1009
01:39:03,437 --> 01:39:05,905
Quiet, please! Quiet.

1010
01:39:07,542 --> 01:39:11,569
And to the next
United States Supreme Court Justice.

1011
01:39:13,148 --> 01:39:15,480
And maybe a new congressman.

1012
01:39:16,385 --> 01:39:18,284
Well, stranger things have happened.

1013
01:39:19,688 --> 01:39:22,485
Here's to you, David, my new son-in-law...

1014
01:39:23,359 --> 01:39:26,055
to your continued success.

1015
01:39:39,342 --> 01:39:41,743
I can't believe
the way you two spend money.

1016
01:39:41,846 --> 01:39:44,747
Give it a rest.
You're starting to sound like Mother.

1017
01:39:44,849 --> 01:39:45,941
Or David.

1018
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:47,540
So how is married life?

1019
01:39:47,652 --> 01:39:50,120
So far so good. Speak of the devil.

1020
01:39:50,221 --> 01:39:51,211
Hey, David.

1021
01:39:51,322 --> 01:39:54,918
Hey, you. You're gonna kill me,
but I can't meet you for drinks.

1022
01:39:55,359 --> 01:39:57,419
But I've been missing you all day.

1023
01:39:57,529 --> 01:40:00,192
I've got to finish up here, okay?
I'll talk to you later.

1024
01:40:00,300 --> 01:40:01,426
Okay.

1025
01:40:01,701 --> 01:40:03,828
Hey, I love you.

1026
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:11,409
Enough. He can't meet us for drinks.
He has to work late.

1027
01:40:11,511 --> 01:40:14,639
Me, either.
I promised I'd meet Fabian for dinner.

1028
01:40:15,315 --> 01:40:17,841
- Who?
- Fabian, yes.

1029
01:40:17,952 --> 01:40:20,045
- Fabian?
- Fabian. Don't start.

1030
01:40:20,488 --> 01:40:22,319
I'm going to see you both Christmas Eve.

1031
01:40:24,926 --> 01:40:27,554
Do you want to join Richard and me
for dinner?

1032
01:40:27,662 --> 01:40:31,257
I'm gonna wait for David.
Guess it means I gotta do more shopping.

1033
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:33,192
I'll see you on the Eve.
