"That one's a goner"

and carry me to bed.

883
01:05:47,978 --> 01:05:49,978
             My dad
      always wanted a boy.

884
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:00,155
  That's why he named me Joey.

885
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:06,027
     I disappointed my dad
        by being a girl

886
01:06:07,698 --> 01:06:10,098
      and my mom by being
     too much like my dad.

887
01:06:20,444 --> 01:06:22,344
       I think that's why
          my dad left,

888
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:26,114
  'cause when he looks at me,

889
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:29,484
        he sees himself.

890
01:06:37,561 --> 01:06:38,626

       be together again.

977
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:57,999
               that you actually
               feel something?

978
01:13:58,001 --> 01:14:01,035
And why don't you just admit
that there's no difference

979

  someone for $10

980

Daddy, can I show you
something?

986
01:14:33,937 --> 01:14:35,203

     What are you talking about?

1000
01:15:41,554 --> 01:15:43,004
          Of course
          I'm interested in you.

              we built together.

1174
01:34:16,118 --> 01:34:18,718
      I don't even know
      who the fuck I am anymore.

1175
01:34:30,332 --> 01:34:32,188
Joey!
 ELLIS:<i> He's got our daughter.</i>

1176
01:34:32,189 --> 01:34:34,045
         WENDY:<i> Joey.</i>
         ELLIS: <i> Joey!</i>

1177
01:34:34,046 --> 01:34:35,902
         WENDY:<i> Joey!</i>
      ELLIS: <i> Joey, stop.</i>

1178
01:34:35,904 --> 01:34:37,354
    WENDY: <i> Get back here.</i>
      ELLIS:<i> Joey, stop.</i>

1179
01:34:37,355 --> 01:34:38,805
       WENDY:<i> Come back,</i>
      <i> what are you doing?</i>

1180
01:34:38,806 --> 01:34:40,256
          ELLIS:<i> Chad!</i>

1181
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:41,707
         ( SHOUTING TO
          COME BACK )

1182
01:34:45,180 --> 01:34:46,179
        JOEY: <i> Get away.</i>
       <i> Get away from me!</i>

1183
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:47,447
        <i> Don't touch me.</i>

1184
01:34:47,449 --> 01:34:48,882
           <i> Let me go.</i>

1185
01:34:48,884 --> 01:34:50,884
             <i> Chad!</i>

1186
01:34:50,886 --> 01:34:55,088
No, no, no!

1187
01:34:58,026 --> 01:34:59,893
        <i> Don't leave me.</i>

1188
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:03,930
         <i> Chad, please.</i>

1189
01:35:03,932 --> 01:35:05,098
        <i> Don't leave me.</i>

1190
01:35:25,754 --> 01:35:26,886
      JOEY: ( NARRATING )
         <i> I had a dream.</i>

1191
01:35:26,888 --> 01:35:28,955
   <i> I was as light as a bird,</i>

1192
01:35:28,957 --> 01:35:32,058
        <i> a spirit flying</i>
        <i> through the air,</i>

1193
01:35:32,060 --> 01:35:36,463
        <i> and I could see</i>
     <i> my home and my family.</i>

1194
01:35:36,465 --> 01:35:39,132
      <i> But then I woke up.</i>

1195
01:35:39,134 --> 01:35:40,400
    <i> And I was on the ground.</i>

1196
01:35:45,474 --> 01:35:47,941
       <i> When you step out</i>
          <i> of a dream,</i>

1197
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:52,696
        <i> things are never</i>
        <i> what they seem.</i>

1198
01:35:52,697 --> 01:35:54,314
   <i> What you thought was real,</i>
      <i> wasn't real at all.</i>

1199
01:35:54,316 --> 01:35:57,784
           <i> Nothing is</i>
       <i> as bright or clear</i>

1200
01:35:57,786 --> 01:35:59,252
         <i> but the dream</i>
        <i> is always there.</i>

1201
01:36:01,123 --> 01:36:06,826
     <i> And it gives you hope</i>
  <i> that one day it will return</i>

1202
01:36:06,828 --> 01:36:08,928
     <i> and, if you're lucky,</i>

1203
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:10,130
           <i> you'll see</i>
       <i> your friend again.</i>

1204
01:36:13,068 --> 01:36:14,200
       It's so beautiful.

1205
01:36:15,403 --> 01:36:16,469
             Yeah.

1206
01:37:23,471 --> 01:37:25,872
             JOEY:
     <i> Some birds fly alone.</i>

1207
01:37:25,874 --> 01:37:28,174
        <i> They're the ones</i>
     <i> that fly the highest,</i>

1208
01:37:28,176 --> 01:37:31,244
       <i> can see the most.</i>

1209
01:37:31,246 --> 01:37:35,281
     <i> They can fly so high,</i>
<i>that they vanish into thin air,</i>

1210
01:37:39,621 --> 01:37:40,887
         <i> like a dream.</i>

1211
01:37:44,993 --> 01:37:46,059
       Don't worry, Mom.

1212
01:37:52,968 --> 01:37:54,400
        All the answers
          are in here.

1213
01:39:32,467 --> 01:39:36,069
         <i> ¶ I'll see you</i>
         <i> In my dreams ¶</i>

1214
01:39:36,071 --> 01:39:40,039
       <i> ¶ And we'll dance</i>
     <i> With you holding me ¶</i>

1215
01:39:40,041 --> 01:39:46,045
   <i> ¶ But I know your heart'll</i>
        <i> Never be mine ¶</i>

1216
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:52,251
      <i> ¶ Moon shines bright</i>
          <i> In the sky ¶</i>

1217
01:39:52,253 --> 01:39:56,389
     <i> ¶ And I see the light</i>
         <i> In your eyes ¶</i>

1218
01:39:56,391 --> 01:40:02,462
    <i> ¶ But I know your heart</i>
      <i> Will never be mine ¶</i>

1219
01:40:04,699 --> 01:40:11,637
      <i> ¶ I know we're never</i>
        <i> To be oh dear ¶</i>

1220
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:17,710
       <i> ¶ I fear my heart</i>
        <i> Is lost to you ¶</i>

1221
01:40:21,082 --> 01:40:27,653
        <i> ¶ My dear sweet</i>
  <i> How madly I fell for thee ¶</i>

1222
01:40:27,655 --> 01:40:33,693
     <i> ¶ Now I fear my heart</i>
        <i> Is lost to you ¶</i>

1223
01:40:45,106 --> 01:40:48,241
  <i> ¶ Your heart stole me away ¶</i>

1224
01:40:48,243 --> 01:40:52,211
        <i> ¶ And I dreamed</i>
       <i> Of you every day ¶</i>

1225
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:58,584
    <i> ¶ But I know your heart</i>
      <i> Will never be mine ¶</i>

1226
01:41:00,655 --> 01:41:06,526
   <i> ¶ So I'll say my fare thee</i>
    <i> Well as my tears fall ¶</i>

1227
01:41:06,528 --> 01:41:10,463
     <i> ¶ How sadly they tell</i>
        <i> How your heart ¶</i>

1228
01:41:12,067 --> 01:41:14,634
     <i> ¶ Will never be mine ¶</i>

1229
01:41:17,138 --> 01:41:23,810
   <i> ¶ I know we're never to be</i>
           <i> Oh dear ¶</i>

1230
01:41:23,812 --> 01:41:30,083
       <i> ¶ I fear my heart</i>
        <i> Is lost to you ¶</i>

1231
01:41:32,754 --> 01:41:39,659
   <i> ¶ My dear sweet how madly</i>
       <i> I fell for thee ¶</i>

1232
01:41:39,661 --> 01:41:46,199
     <i> ¶ Now I fear my heart</i>
        <i> Is lost to you ¶</i>

1233
01:41:48,136 --> 01:41:55,374
     <i> ¶ Yes I fear my heart</i>
        <i> Is lost to you ¶</i>
