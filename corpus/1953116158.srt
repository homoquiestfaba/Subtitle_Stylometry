- I know that, Chief.

27
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,900
There's no hoIe in that fire waII.

00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:14,811
We're on the forest service road.
Big Dipper, I'm gonna need a doubIe hit.

60
00:09:14,862 --> 00:09:19,890
I need one on my Iocation, and I need one

Hit the road! Hit the road!

65
00:11:17,942 --> 00:11:24,734
OK, you've iustiumped out of a pe_ectIy
good airpIane and Ianded in the top of a tree.

66
00:11:28,982 --> 00:11:33,976
Which is why we wear these
othe_ise idiotic-Iooking suits.

67
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:39,736
The fire's about five miIes away.
You got a IittIe time, so Iet's review.

68
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:43,855
You got a 10,OOO-acre fire,
and it's breathin' right down your throat.

69
00:11:48,782 --> 00:11:50,852
Sherman! You aII right up there?

70
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:52,898
Uh... yeah.

71
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:57,894
Am I gonna have to
come up there and get you?

72
00:11:57,942 --> 00:11:59,853
No, sir.

73
00:11:59,902 --> 00:12:02,814
You gotta get down now! Go! Go! Go!

74
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:07,740
(Jesse) Remember,
evey second counts here.

75
00:12:07,782 --> 00:12:11,741
Trust me, you don't wanna
get caught in the path of a firestorm.

76
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:14,859
OK, it's gettin' hot now. ReaI hot.

77
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:18,941
At 300 degrees, trees expIode
from their own boiIing sap.

78
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:24,818
At 500 degrees, rocks expIode.
So Iet's go. Faster! Faster! Faster!

79
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:26,778
Aargh!

80
00:12:30,742 --> 00:12:32,972
Not quite that fast, son.

81
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:35,852
- Who rigged the safety Iines?
- I did.

82
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:38,860
You think maybe you oughta
shorten 'em next time?

83
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:42,775
AII right. Get your gear together,
head over to the pIane.

84
00:12:43,862 --> 00:12:45,773
Sherman!

85
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:51,811
You know, I'm not sure whether you're tyin'
to kiII yourseIf or you're tyin' to kiII me.

86
00:12:51,862 --> 00:12:54,854
But droppin' that PuIaski on me
wiII cost you points.

87
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:56,898
Yeah. I know. Itiust sIipped.

88
00:12:57,822 --> 00:13:01,895
Some smokeiumpers spend an hour each day
poIishing and sharpening their PuIaskis.

89
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:04,820
They'II give 'em names,
carve designs in 'em.

90
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:09,856
HeII, I've known some guys that have
sIept with these things under their piIIows.

91
00:13:09,902 --> 00:13:12,860
Granted, they were IoneIy and disturbed men.

92
00:13:13,742 --> 00:13:15,937
Bottom Iine - never, ever,

93
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:20,735
ever... drop your PuIaski out of a tree.

94
00:13:21,862 --> 00:13:24,899
- Got it.
- No, Sherm, you don't got it.

95
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:27,934
And you're gonna need
a Iot more work before you do get it.

96
00:13:27,982 --> 00:13:33,818
Now, tomorrow mornin' I want you
to report to the county crew chief.

97
00:13:33,862 --> 00:13:37,901
You're gonna have to pound
some more ground before you fIy the sm.

98
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:41,855
- But...
- Sorry, son. That's it.

99
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,977
''Gonna have to pound more ground

100
00:13:46,982 --> 00:13:50,941
- Not bad, huh? How we doin'?
- Prem damn good.

101
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:55,776
Jee, these times are a Iot faster
than I ever got down when I was in training.

102
00:13:55,782 --> 00:13:58,819
You had an exceptionaIIy useIess
jackass for an instructor.

103
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:00,773
- Wynt!
- Wynt!

104
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:03,859
- How's the new chief?

105
00:14:03,902 --> 00:14:06,814
- The new guy is an idiot, Wynt.
- TotaI weaseI.

106
00:14:06,822 --> 00:14:08,892

00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:13,817

108
00:14:13,862 --> 00:14:15,853
- You got a name?
- ''Wynt'' if it's a boy.

109
00:14:15,862 --> 00:14:18,854
- You don't have to kiss his ass any more.
- ''Cowboy'' if it's a girI.

110
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,775

Giddy-up.

113
00:14:31,942 --> 00:14:37,938
Look... eveybody wants me to ask you one
more time. Are you sure you wanna do this?

114
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:40,940
We've been over that. I can'tiump any more.

115
00:14:40,982 --> 00:14:44,770
Agh! You can stiII iump.

00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:46,932
OK, I couId iump.

117
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:50,935
I iust can't Iand. It's over, Jess. I don't mind.

118
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:55,817
- I iust can't heIp feeIin' bad about this.
- Why shouId you feeI bad?

119
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:59,815
If I hadn't gone in after that IittIe girI,
you'd stiII be jumpin'.

120
00:14:59,862 --> 00:15:03,855
Ifyou hadn't gone a_er

121
00:15:06,942 --> 00:15:10,730
WeII, what the heII are you gonna do?

00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:18,854
Nah, I'II get some kindaiob

124
00:15:18,902 --> 00:15:23,896
First I'm goin' to the Baia, do some fishin'.
Speakin' ofwhich,

125
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:27,981
I was wasting my time up on the ChiIkoot

126
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:30,818
They soId that track to deveIopers.

127
00:15:30,822 --> 00:15:33,939
I don't know if it's the winds or what,
but it's dy as heII up there.

128
00:15:33,982 --> 00:15:38,851
Moisture IeveI's gotta be beIow

129
00:15:38,862 --> 00:15:43,811
There's somethin' I wanna show you. Oh,

00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:22,740
- Do you think about him?
- Yeah, I think about him.

137
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:25,979

138
00:16:25,982 --> 00:16:28,815
evey time I start my car.

Boy, I'II teII ya, God gave us a good one here.

146
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:06,777
You couIdn't ask for a better day
to jump out of a pe_ectIy good airpIane.

147
00:17:06,822 --> 00:17:08,813
Oh! I'm pumped up!

You wanna give the money back?
You think that's gonna square it?

You don't know the kinda peopIe we're deaIin'

152
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:35,812
Look, iust do the iob and keep the money.
Have a few Coronas and forget about it.

153

154
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:42,811

You've done an exempIayiob, Mr Davis.

159
00:18:28,782 --> 00:18:33,810
There's a Iot I can't do. We don't even know

00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,820

00:18:36,862 --> 00:18:40,775
How the heII you think you'II get on
the crew? These peopIe aren't stupid.

162
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:46,858
Maybe they save money by Iettin' convicts

163
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:50,895
That's why they onIy Iet the short-timers on,

No. He voIunteered to stay behind because
of his desire for a substantiaI bonus.

Now, that's five miIIion apiece.

- Yeah.

315
00:35:58,862 --> 00:36:01,820
Hey! What the heII are you doin'?

316
00:36:01,822 --> 00:36:06,850
From now on we're Canadian firefighters.
Last time I checked, they didn't cary guns.

317
00:36:06,902 --> 00:36:10,736
- Lose 'em.
- We're gonna be sittin' ducks out there.

318
00:36:11,822 --> 00:36:12,811
Ah, shit!

319
00:36:43,982 --> 00:36:47,975
- Smokeiump 1 to base camp.
- (Moníca ) Smokejump 1, thís ís base camp.

320
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:51,979
- You get that county crew on 24 outta there?
- They were Ieayín' as I caIIed.

321
00:36:52,782 --> 00:36:57,810
Good. We're gonna head over to L-11 and
see ifwe can't sIow the son of a bitch down.

322
00:36:57,862 --> 00:37:01,935
When Wynt gets in teII him that
new red bIob on his infrared is a bacMire.

323
00:37:01,982 --> 00:37:03,734
Jesse.

324
00:37:03,782 --> 00:37:05,738
Out.

325
00:37:05,782 --> 00:37:08,854
Don't we have to get authorisation for that?

326
00:37:10,942 --> 00:37:13,934
Right, Chief. L-11, here we come.

327
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:19,855
(Shaye) WrestIer, huh?
I Ioved wrestIing when I was a kid.

328
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,854
Big guy Iike you must've been
a badass. What'd they caII you?

329
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:25,860
The Mad Monk.
Shaved my head, wore a hood.

330
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:27,933
Then I was AttiIa the Hun for a whiIe.

331
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:32,817
But the wig kept sIiding over my eyes,
so the other wrestIers beat the shit outta me.

332
00:37:32,862 --> 00:37:36,821
I hate to break up this get-to-know-you
session, but where the heII are we?

333
00:37:36,862 --> 00:37:40,855
- You ever fight Bobby RenaIdo?
- Loomis! CouId you shut up for a second?

334
00:37:40,902 --> 00:37:43,974
Look at the map, teII us
how much farther to the tradin' post!

335
00:37:44,742 --> 00:37:47,779
- Hey, we're here.
- Which means, my ever-impatient friend,

336
00:37:47,822 --> 00:37:50,939
that the road that we're Iooking for
is right beyond that ridge.

337
00:37:50,982 --> 00:37:52,973
We're aImost outta here, boys.

338
00:37:53,742 --> 00:37:57,860
You ever kiII a man, Mr Karge?
It reaIIy is quite exhiIarating, you know.

339
00:39:00,782 --> 00:39:02,852
Jesse's bacMire show on the infrared?

340
00:39:02,902 --> 00:39:04,938
(Moníca ) Just coming through now.

341
00:39:04,982 --> 00:39:06,973
Wind speed?

342
00:39:09,742 --> 00:39:11,972
Uh, base camp is at 20, gusting up to 40.

343
00:39:12,782 --> 00:39:13,851
40?

344
00:39:15,982 --> 00:39:19,895
That shouId do it.
Let's go check out the east fIank.

345
00:39:26,862 --> 00:39:29,934
Did we ever get a caII from County
teIIin' us they were cIear?

346
00:39:30,742 --> 00:39:31,936
CaII 'em.

347
00:39:35,982 --> 00:39:40,897
(Moníca ) Smokejump base camp caIIíng
county crew. County crew, come ín, pIease.

348
00:39:40,942 --> 00:39:44,730

349
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:45,817

350
00:39:45,862 --> 00:39:50,890
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
They can't hear you. Now, shut the fuck up!

351
00:39:50,902 --> 00:39:53,939
Smokeiump base camp

352
00:39:55,982 --> 00:40:00,976

353
00:40:01,782 --> 00:40:03,773
Pass it down there.

354
00:40:03,822 --> 00:40:05,813
Give it to me!

355
00:40:05,942 --> 00:40:08,854
Come on, BeIcher.

356
00:40:08,902 --> 00:40:12,941
Smokejump base camp caIIíng county crew.
County crew, come ín, pIease.

357
00:40:13,902 --> 00:40:14,937
Easy!

358
00:40:21,782 --> 00:40:23,852
- Hury up!
- Come on, BeIcher. Come on, buddy.

359
00:40:23,902 --> 00:40:28,896
Get down there. Do it. Come on.
Come on, stick it in there.

00:40:28,942 --> 00:40:30,933

00:40:40,862 --> 00:40:42,932
Come on, BeIcher.

364
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,973
Come on, buddy.

365
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:48,853
You idiot!

366
00:40:48,902 --> 00:40:50,972
ToId ya I shouIda done it.

367
00:40:54,902 --> 00:40:58,736
- They're not responding, Wynt.
- ShouId we caII the sheriff?

368
00:40:58,782 --> 00:41:01,740
- No, we're cIoser. I'II go.
- You want us to go with you?

369
00:41:01,782 --> 00:41:06,731
No, you guys wait here. County might need
you at any minute. Hey, Monica, keep tyin'.

370
00:41:06,782 --> 00:41:08,818
And Iet me know ifJesse gets back.

371
00:41:11,982 --> 00:41:14,860
(Loomís) What the fuck...?

372
00:41:15,862 --> 00:41:18,820
- I thought you knew where we were goin'.
- I do.

373
00:41:18,862 --> 00:41:21,899
- Did we go in a circIe?
- No, that's anotherfire.

374
00:41:21,942 --> 00:41:24,900
Ifwe go aIong this ridge Iine
we can probabIy outFIank it.

375
00:41:24,942 --> 00:41:26,933
Come on, we got time.

376
00:41:40,982 --> 00:41:42,813
Hey!

377
00:41:43,862 --> 00:41:44,897
Wait!

378
00:41:49,782 --> 00:41:52,979
- I'm so happy to see you.
- rCanadían accent) There's a big fire comin'.

379
00:41:53,022 --> 00:41:56,731
- What the heck you doing out here?
- I study birds and I was...

380
00:41:56,782 --> 00:41:58,818
We gotta get goin' now.

381
00:41:58,862 --> 00:42:02,855
We'd aII Iike to get our butts back
to AIberta in one piece if possibIe, eh?

382
00:42:02,862 --> 00:42:05,740
- AIberta?
- We're down from Canada heIpin' out.

383
00:42:05,782 --> 00:42:08,819
- Can you take me outta here?
- Righto. But no bike, eh?

384
00:42:08,822 --> 00:42:11,894
(bad Canadían accent)
Captain, couId we ask you somethin', eh?

385
00:42:11,982 --> 00:42:14,860
Go hury up and get your gear.

386
00:42:16,782 --> 00:42:21,981
Nice accent. I thought you were gonna throw
somethin' in about Gretzm and the French.

387
00:42:22,782 --> 00:42:26,821
Do yourseIves a favour. Keep your
mouths shut and Iet me do the taIkin'.

388
00:42:26,822 --> 00:42:28,858
What the heII are you bringin' her for?

389
00:42:28,902 --> 00:42:30,938
Are you kiddin'?

390
00:42:31,022 --> 00:42:35,971
A femaIe hostage - that's insurance.
Piece ofthe fuckin' rock.

391
00:42:35,982 --> 00:42:38,974
- I'm not gonna take anything eIse.
- AII right.

392
00:42:39,742 --> 00:42:42,939
- OK. I'm ready.
- Hey, Iady. No worries.

393
00:42:55,982 --> 00:42:58,894
I can't breathe!

394
00:42:58,942 --> 00:43:03,891
- I can't breathe!
- You're gonna Iet aII the smoke in!

395
00:43:03,942 --> 00:43:07,935
I'd rather die from smoke
than roast Iike meat in a can!

396
00:43:19,822 --> 00:43:21,813
Jesse. Ground-pounders.

397
00:43:23,942 --> 00:43:28,857
What the heII are they doin' down there?
They're waIkin' right into the bacMire.

398
00:43:28,862 --> 00:43:32,775
- I'II caII Monica. She can send in the pIane.
- Too Iate. Take me down.

399
00:43:32,822 --> 00:43:35,939
- And Iand where?
- Then take me up.

400
00:43:35,982 --> 00:43:40,772
Come on, Jesse, not again!
You are notjumping...

401
00:43:40,822 --> 00:43:45,771
You're right, I'm notiumping.
It's more Iike faIIing.

402
00:43:46,982 --> 00:43:48,973
Ah, shit!

403
00:43:53,862 --> 00:43:55,978
- So, you're into birds too?
- Yeah.

404
00:43:56,742 --> 00:43:59,814
Oh, that's great, you know, cos I Iove 'em.
I reaIIy Iove birds.

405
00:43:59,862 --> 00:44:03,855
I had one ofthe IittIe green guys,
the parakeech, when I was a kid. It was great.

406
00:44:03,902 --> 00:44:05,893
- Go up and take the point.
- AII right.

407
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:07,773
- You doin' aII right?
- Yeah.

408
00:44:07,822 --> 00:44:08,891
Good.

409
00:44:09,902 --> 00:44:11,779
Shaye.

410
00:44:40,862 --> 00:44:42,773
Shit.

411
00:44:59,862 --> 00:45:00,817
Argh!

412
00:45:06,822 --> 00:45:09,859
Hey! You aII right down there, Chief?

413
00:45:09,862 --> 00:45:12,740
WiII be when we get outta here.

414
00:45:13,822 --> 00:45:17,861
What the heII are you guys doin' here
anyway? You were headed into a bacMire.

415
00:45:17,902 --> 00:45:20,939
- Lucm for us you're out here.
- Luck had nothin' to do with it.

416
00:45:20,982 --> 00:45:22,973
- I set the bacMire.
- You set it?

417
00:45:23,742 --> 00:45:26,939
We set 'em to draw oxygen
away from the main fire.

418
00:45:26,982 --> 00:45:29,940
I'm afraid this one's runnin' hard on us.

419
00:45:29,982 --> 00:45:33,770
We're gonna need to
get movin' now. Let's go.

420
00:45:50,822 --> 00:45:53,859
- For God's sake, man, get us outta here.
- Where are the keys?

421
00:45:53,902 --> 00:45:56,860
Right out there.

422
00:45:57,822 --> 00:46:00,780
Anybody here know how to hot-wire a bus?

423
00:46:11,822 --> 00:46:15,895
We were headed for a pIace caIIed the tradin'
post. Our chief said he'd meet us there.

424
00:46:15,942 --> 00:46:20,777
Good, cos that's where we're goin'.
What the heII are you doin' at D4?

425
00:46:20,782 --> 00:46:24,980
- Not supposed to be anyone near that zone.
- We were doin' a sweep for campers in D-3.

426
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:29,855
I guess we must've drived into D4.
Anyway, she's the onIy one that we found.

427
00:46:29,902 --> 00:46:32,860
Why were you on the ridge Iine?

428
00:46:32,862 --> 00:46:37,811
Guess it seems kinda stupid right now,
but I thought it was the fastest way out.

429
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:39,773
Fire runs uphiII. You know that.

430
00:46:39,822 --> 00:46:42,780
We'd no idea where we were
untiI we were in the thick of it.

431
00:46:42,822 --> 00:46:47,771
You know us Ioan-out fire bums. Kinda green
when it comes to the terrain, you know.

432
00:46:47,822 --> 00:46:48,971
Sure am gIad you dropped out.

433
00:47:14,862 --> 00:47:16,898
Hey, Wynt.

434
00:47:16,942 --> 00:47:20,730
Does the name
RandaII AIexander Shaye ring a beII?

435
00:47:20,782 --> 00:47:24,900
- Yeah, wasn't there some kinda robbey?
- Dawson Pass train robbey four years ago.

436
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:29,857
He and five guys hit a federaI depositoy
transfer train in a tunneI in CoIorado.

437
00:47:29,902 --> 00:47:31,893
Right. He buried eveyone aIive.

438
00:47:31,942 --> 00:47:35,855
The guards, train crew, his own men. 1I dead.

439
00:47:36,782 --> 00:47:38,977
He got caught,
but not before he hid the money.

440
00:47:38,982 --> 00:47:42,736
I think we can safeIy say
this fire was no accident.

441
00:47:42,782 --> 00:47:46,775
The firefighters say Shaye and his men
took their shirts and heImets.

442
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,814
Then teII the roadbIocks
to hoId any fire crews.

443
00:47:51,982 --> 00:47:56,737
- What's wrong? Take in a IittIe smoke today?
- Yeah, maybe a IittIe.

444
00:48:05,862 --> 00:48:08,820
(Shaye) Goddamn, that's one heII of a cIimb.

445
00:48:09,822 --> 00:48:13,735
Hey, nice goin'. Our chief
ought to be here any minute now.

446
00:48:13,782 --> 00:48:15,898
Look, I'm gonna go and get some water.

447
00:48:16,822 --> 00:48:19,973
- Can I get anybody anything?
- I thought it was cIosed.

448
00:48:19,982 --> 00:48:21,973
I got a key.

449
00:48:23,862 --> 00:48:28,856
Hey! When we get outta here, I'm gonna
buy you a nice big Canadian beer, eh?

450
00:48:36,822 --> 00:48:38,858
Mr Karge...

451
00:48:39,862 --> 00:48:42,934
do you think that you couId take the fireman?

452
00:48:44,782 --> 00:48:47,740
- Yes.
- Good. KiII him.

453
00:48:47,862 --> 00:48:48,851
What?

454
00:48:51,902 --> 00:48:53,938
Make another sound, I'II break your arms.

455
00:48:53,982 --> 00:48:56,860
Goddammit, you don't
have to do shit Iike that.

456
00:48:56,902 --> 00:49:00,895
No, I do. I reaIIy fucking do.

457
00:49:04,742 --> 00:49:08,894
Mr Loomis, there's a Suburban parked
right on the other side ofthose trees.

458
00:49:08,942 --> 00:49:12,776
You gentIemen kindIy take our guest
and wait for me there.

459
00:49:13,942 --> 00:49:16,820
I'm gonna give Mr Karge a hand.

460
00:49:19,902 --> 00:49:23,736
In case you haven't noticed,
we're not firemen.

461
00:49:52,902 --> 00:49:54,779
( ríngs out)

462
00:49:54,782 --> 00:49:57,774
Come on, Monica. Pick up, pick up, come on.

463
00:49:57,982 --> 00:49:59,973
You gotta be there.

464
00:50:44,902 --> 00:50:48,736
Hey, it's gonna be OK,
cos I ain't gonna Iet him hurt you no more.

465
00:50:48,782 --> 00:50:51,774
You're iust our insurance, that's aII.

466
00:50:51,822 --> 00:50:55,861
You know, I was thinkin'
um, when we get outta th'is,

467
00:50:55,902 --> 00:50:59,815
ifyou and I couId iust
spend a IittIe time together...

468
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:01,813
weII...

469
00:51:02,862 --> 00:51:04,978
you'd see that I'm a good guy.

470
00:51:05,982 --> 00:51:10,897
I took this, um, this cooking cIass
when I was inside, and, uh...

471
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:16,812
weII, I ain't no great chef or nothin',
but I figure I couId get a good job.

472
00:51:20,782 --> 00:51:21,897
(whístIes)

473
00:51:56,822 --> 00:52:00,895
Now the finaI round. StiII undefeated.

474
00:52:01,942 --> 00:52:04,900
The man you Iove to hate.

475
00:52:04,942 --> 00:52:06,853
The Executioner.

476
00:52:29,982 --> 00:52:31,973
StiII undefeated.

477
00:52:36,982 --> 00:52:40,861
Hey! What's going on? What are you doing?

478
00:52:40,902 --> 00:52:42,938
- What am I doing?
- Open the door, Shaye!

479
00:52:42,942 --> 00:52:44,933
I'm kiIIing you, you stupid moron.

480
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,818
- Come on!
- It's nothing personaI.

481
00:52:47,862 --> 00:52:49,978
It's... strictIy a matter of mathematics.

482
00:52:51,862 --> 00:52:53,978
- It is my money.
- Open the door!

483
00:52:55,862 --> 00:52:57,978
- I wiII do this for you.
- Open it!

484
00:53:08,942 --> 00:53:11,820
Ty not to think about it, you know.

485
00:53:11,862 --> 00:53:14,854
Just think about a happy time
when you were a kid.

486
00:53:14,902 --> 00:53:16,893
Get out!

487
00:53:20,982 --> 00:53:23,815
I think you might need this.

488
00:53:34,822 --> 00:53:37,814
- Let's go.
- rPacker) Wait, what happened to Karge?

489
00:53:37,862 --> 00:53:40,740
The fireman put an axe in his chest.

490
00:53:40,822 --> 00:53:44,974
But don't wory, he's burnin' in heII for it.
Come on, Iet's go.

491
00:54:16,822 --> 00:54:18,813
Shit! We can'tiump in that!

492
00:54:18,862 --> 00:54:20,773
Yeah, I know.

493
00:54:20,822 --> 00:54:24,940
It's up to Jesse, but I say tiII these winds die
down, we go heIp the ground crews in D-5.

494
00:54:24,982 --> 00:54:27,860
Hey! Where is Jesse?

495
00:54:34,782 --> 00:54:36,773
- He iumped!
- He what?!

496
00:54:36,822 --> 00:54:42,738
We saw some ground-pounders in the woods
between the main fire and Jesse's bacMire.

497
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:45,933
They weren't firefighters.
It was a prison break.

498
00:54:48,982 --> 00:54:51,815
How couId you Iet him do that?
He saved your Iife.

499
00:54:51,862 --> 00:54:56,777
WeII, my dear, ifyou're Iooking for
an aIIy in Mr Packer, I must caution you.

500
00:54:56,822 --> 00:55:01,771
The man has raped numerous women,
amongst other barnyard creatures, I'm sure.

501
00:55:02,782 --> 00:55:05,854
That wouId make you a goddamn Iiar.
I ain't ever raped no one.

502
00:55:05,862 --> 00:55:09,855
Why Iive in deniaI, Mr Packer?
Be who you are. Let it aII hang out.

503
00:55:09,902 --> 00:55:13,736
And in your case,
that's what's known as a sexuaI predator.

504
00:55:13,782 --> 00:55:16,819
Hey, Dr AuschIander said I was aII right.

505
00:55:18,862 --> 00:55:22,741
- He just said it was a chemicaI imbaIance.
- ChemicaI imbaIance!

506
00:55:22,782 --> 00:55:26,741
- I know what chemicaI is imbaIanced.
- (Loomís Iaughs)

507
00:55:26,782 --> 00:55:27,897
Funny guy.

508
00:55:27,942 --> 00:55:30,900
Just kidding, Mr Packer.
Don't be so sensitive.

509
00:55:30,942 --> 00:55:33,775
He's a pervy, Iady bird.

510
00:55:34,822 --> 00:55:36,813
rPacker) Fuck you!

511
00:55:38,982 --> 00:55:43,772
Before you got here the phone rang
a few times. When I got to it the voice cut out.

512
00:55:43,822 --> 00:55:45,938
- What are you sayin'?
- It couId have been Jesse.

513
00:55:45,982 --> 00:55:48,894
On what? One ofthe many
payphones in the forest?

514
00:55:48,942 --> 00:55:51,934
There's a phone
at the trading post, buttmunch.

515
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:55,816
Not any more there isn't.
Isn't that the trading post?

516
00:55:55,862 --> 00:55:57,932
- Moníca ) That's not part ofthe fire.
- rPete) No.

517
00:55:57,942 --> 00:56:01,901
I'II get the sheri_to go take a Iook.
You guys heIp the ground-pounders.

518
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,933
Come on, Cowboy.

519
00:56:12,942 --> 00:56:15,820
(Packer) So, how are we
gonna get outta here?

520
00:56:15,822 --> 00:56:17,858
Why don't you Iet me wory about that, huh?

521
00:56:17,942 --> 00:56:20,775
You can bet they've found that bus by now.

522
00:56:20,822 --> 00:56:23,859
- I'm sure they have.
- There's gonna be roadbIocks eve_here.

523
00:56:23,902 --> 00:56:26,974
Mr Packer, why don't you iust
keep charming your girIfriend

524
00:56:26,982 --> 00:56:29,940
and Ieave the thinking
to those better suited for it?

525
00:56:30,742 --> 00:56:33,814
- We're not going by road, Einstein.
- Oh, we're fIyin'?

526
00:56:33,862 --> 00:56:36,820
Too rism. Ifthey couIdn't fIy,
neither couId we.

527
00:56:36,902 --> 00:56:39,814
- (Packer) So then what?
- rShaye) They'II be watchin' the roads.

528
00:56:39,822 --> 00:56:44,771
But I doubt that they'II be watchin' the rivers.
We're just gonna fIoat out.

529
00:56:46,982 --> 00:56:48,779
Whoa!

530
00:56:53,902 --> 00:56:57,815
Jesus! What's the chance ofthat happenin'?

531
00:56:59,782 --> 00:57:01,773
VirtuaIIy none.

532
00:57:09,982 --> 00:57:12,780
Get in the truck.

533
00:57:19,942 --> 00:57:21,853
- Go!
- Hang on!

534
00:57:29,942 --> 00:57:31,773
Let's go.

535
00:57:35,782 --> 00:57:38,819
- Nice work.
- We won't be seein' them again.

536
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:48,935
- Get me cIose enough that I can kiII 'em!
- Why kiII them? They're just runnin' away.

537
00:57:48,942 --> 00:57:51,854
Where do you think they're running?
To Burger King?

538
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:53,972
You said eveybody knows we're on the run!

539
00:57:54,782 --> 00:57:56,932
But they don't know how
we pIan to escape. She does.

540
00:57:56,942 --> 00:57:58,853
- Switch pIaces with me.
- What?!

541
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,819
Do it! Do it now!

542
00:58:00,862 --> 00:58:02,853
Come on! CIoser!

543
00:58:08,982 --> 00:58:11,940
What the heII's she doin'?

544
00:58:21,902 --> 00:58:24,735
Come on!

545
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:27,813
( motor starts)

546
00:58:33,942 --> 00:58:35,898
I'II kiII you!

547
00:58:37,782 --> 00:58:40,854
What are you doin', idiot? Drive! Drive!

548
00:58:48,782 --> 00:58:50,932
We got him now. I want the son of a bitch.

549
00:58:50,982 --> 00:58:53,815
r_esse) Damn! They're cIosin' in on us.

550
00:58:55,982 --> 00:58:58,815
There's onIy one way outta here now!

551
00:58:58,862 --> 00:59:00,898
Turn! Go! Go!

552
00:59:00,942 --> 00:59:02,898
Turn!

553
00:59:03,982 --> 00:59:05,859
Take over!

554
00:59:09,942 --> 00:59:12,775
I got it.

555
00:59:13,942 --> 00:59:15,933
(woman screams)

556
00:59:19,862 --> 00:59:21,853
Look out!

557
00:59:27,822 --> 00:59:29,892
Just hang on!

558
00:59:33,982 --> 00:59:35,859
(screams)

559
00:59:35,902 --> 00:59:38,814
- Hang on!
- No kidding!

560
00:59:39,782 --> 00:59:42,819
Hang on. I gotta steer this thing!

561
00:59:57,942 --> 00:59:59,853
Hang on!

562
01:00:00,742 --> 01:00:02,812
(screams)

563
01:00:11,782 --> 01:00:13,852
Shit. I hate water.

564
01:00:14,942 --> 01:00:16,819
Agh! Argh!

565
01:00:37,862 --> 01:00:39,853
No hury here!

566
01:00:40,822 --> 01:00:42,778
I'm iust drownin'!

567
01:00:54,742 --> 01:00:56,858
Save your buIIets.
You can't hit them from here.

568
01:00:56,902 --> 01:00:59,780
(Packer) Goddammit!
Now we're good and fucked!

569
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:03,895
- Don't be such a pessimist. Come on.
- Why don't we just get the heII outta here?

570
01:01:03,942 --> 01:01:08,857
We are getting the heII out of here. We're stiII
headed to the same pIace we've aIways been.

571
01:01:08,902 --> 01:01:10,893
Oh, yeah. Wherever the heII that is.

572
01:01:10,902 --> 01:01:15,851
Ifyou don't Iike it, feeI free to go an_here
you want. I'II be happy to hoId your share.

573
01:01:15,902 --> 01:01:19,815
- I mean, that is, ifyou make it.
- But what about them?

574
01:01:23,942 --> 01:01:27,855
I hope there's somethin' important in there.

575
01:01:27,902 --> 01:01:29,813
Damn important.

576
01:01:29,862 --> 01:01:33,935
Save-the-Iives-of-chiIdren-around-the-worId
kinda important.

577
01:01:34,902 --> 01:01:36,938
You bet there is.

578
01:01:38,822 --> 01:01:40,938
Cyanocítta steIIerí, huh?

579
01:01:40,982 --> 01:01:43,940
- You're a bird-watcher?
- It's a weekend hobby.

580
01:01:43,982 --> 01:01:45,859
Think you dropped this.

581
01:01:49,782 --> 01:01:51,898
(Packer) ..takin' us on this wiId-goose chase...

582
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:55,935
- (Jesse) Why are they stiII foIIowin' us?
- (Packer) It's buIIshit...

583
01:01:55,942 --> 01:01:59,935
I know their escape route. They've got a boat
to take them up the river into Canada.

584
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:03,736
It's gotta be the Humber.
They'II have to put in at Crane Lake.

585
01:02:03,782 --> 01:02:05,818
About eight miIes that way.

586
01:02:05,862 --> 01:02:08,820
The way that fire's behavin'
on both sides of us,

587
01:02:08,822 --> 01:02:11,859
- that's the safest pIace to be.
- So we shouId get there first.

588
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:20,852
Sory to have to search you, but there's been
a prison break, so we have to check peopIe...

589
01:02:23,902 --> 01:02:25,779
Sheriff.

590
01:02:26,822 --> 01:02:28,892
- There's a body in the store, Wynt.
- Jesse?

591
01:02:28,942 --> 01:02:31,820
We won't know for a whiIe.

592
01:02:32,822 --> 01:02:35,859
Any sign ofthe rest ofthem?
They couId be an_here.

593
01:02:35,902 --> 01:02:40,771
Wish we couId send up some pIanes, man.
But we're smoked in, you know?

594
01:02:40,822 --> 01:02:43,939
Head back to headquarters.
I'II caII you the second we hear anything.

595
01:02:43,982 --> 01:02:45,973
Thanks, Garrett.

596
01:03:00,942 --> 01:03:04,776
(Loomís) I had to fIy down a canyon
Iike this once in CoIombia

597
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,892
with their internationaI guard a_er me.

598
01:03:06,942 --> 01:03:10,901
- Sounds Iike you were a prem good piIot.
- Yeah, I was.

599
01:03:10,902 --> 01:03:14,815
Why don't we see
ifyou stiII know how to fIy, huh?

600
01:03:14,862 --> 01:03:15,931
Argh!

601
01:03:15,982 --> 01:03:17,893
Loomis!

602
01:03:19,822 --> 01:03:21,778
Oh, God.

603
01:03:25,982 --> 01:03:27,893
What happened?

604
01:03:27,942 --> 01:03:31,901
We were iust taIkin'.
He turned around to Iook at me.

605
01:03:32,902 --> 01:03:34,893
He sIipped.

606
01:03:37,782 --> 01:03:38,931
Jesus.

607
01:03:48,782 --> 01:03:49,897
Jesus.

608
01:03:55,782 --> 01:03:58,774
- WouId you hury up?
- This isn't gonna work.

609
01:03:58,822 --> 01:04:00,813
- My Ieg's kiIIin' me.
- Let me Iook at it.

610
01:04:00,862 --> 01:04:04,741
No. I'm hoIdin' you up.
You get to Crane Lake. You'II be safe there.

611
01:04:04,782 --> 01:04:06,773
First Iet me Iook at your knee.

612
01:04:06,822 --> 01:04:10,781
These guys are comin' across that river
any minute. When they do, we're dead.

613
01:04:10,822 --> 01:04:14,735
We wiII be ifyou Iook Iike Big Bird.
Lose the shirt.

614
01:04:42,782 --> 01:04:45,854
- This isn't too bad. I can pop it back in.
- Right.

615
01:04:45,862 --> 01:04:47,932
- Might hurt a bit.
- You're serious.

616
01:04:48,822 --> 01:04:53,816
This is not fixing a bird's broken wing. I need
an orthopaedist, and you're a bird-watcher.

617
01:04:53,862 --> 01:04:55,739
- ( crunchíng)
- (Jesse grunts)

618
01:04:55,982 --> 01:05:00,772
- OrnithoIogist to you.
- How'd you do that?

619
01:05:00,782 --> 01:05:03,899
Combat medic training,
marine corps. Sempern.

620
01:05:03,942 --> 01:05:06,775
- You? A marine?
- I may as weII have been.

621
01:05:06,822 --> 01:05:11,737
My dad's in the corps, third generation.
Guess who was supposed to be the fourth.

622
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:15,741
- Guess who wanted a boy.
- Guess who got three girIs.

623
01:05:15,782 --> 01:05:17,818
Evey summer was Iike boot camp.

624
01:05:17,862 --> 01:05:21,855
I can't cook, but I fieId-strip an M-16
and shoot it at marksman IeveI.

625
01:05:21,902 --> 01:05:23,938
Set bones, tape sprains, stop bIeeding.

626
01:05:23,982 --> 01:05:28,772
And ifyou choke, I do a nim tracheotomy
with a pocket knife and a baIIpoint pen.

627
01:05:28,822 --> 01:05:30,938
I chew vey carefuIIy, thank you.

628
01:05:31,862 --> 01:05:34,899
- So, Shaye, about my cut ofthe money...
- Shh.

630
01:06:40,862 --> 01:06:42,773
What now?

631
01:06:42,822 --> 01:06:45,734
We need to Iet some friends of mine
know where we are.

632
01:06:45,782 --> 01:06:48,819
- Your dad teach you any survivaI training?
- Yeah.

633
01:06:48,862 --> 01:06:51,820
He teach you how to start a fire
with a rock and a stick?

634
01:06:51,862 --> 01:06:54,740
We were Iucm ifwe got
a big and some mud.

635
01:06:54,782 --> 01:06:56,898
Prem cocm, huh? OK.

636
01:06:56,942 --> 01:06:59,775
Let's see how good you are.

637
01:07:05,982 --> 01:07:07,973
( crackIíng)

638
01:07:18,902 --> 01:07:19,891
Huh.

639
01:07:20,862 --> 01:07:24,821
They shouId see this at headquarters.
Ifthey're not pIayin' Ping-Pong.

640
01:07:24,862 --> 01:07:26,853
Uh-huh. Like smoke signaIs.

641
01:07:27,942 --> 01:07:32,857
(femaIe reporter) Mr ViddeI, how invoIved are
you in the escape? Can we have a statement?

642
01:07:32,942 --> 01:07:37,777
- Mr ViddeI, can you teII us what's going on?
- I was Mr Shaye's attorney, not his friend.

643
01:07:37,902 --> 01:07:42,771
I'm as shocked and horíífied as anyone
by what happened here today.

644
01:07:46,822 --> 01:07:50,815
- The sheri_ ID that body at the trading post?
- (beepíng)

645
01:07:51,902 --> 01:07:53,972
- He's not dead, Wynt.
- What?

646
01:07:54,742 --> 01:07:56,858
I mean he's not dead. Look.

647
01:07:59,862 --> 01:08:01,818
That's Jesse.

648
01:08:01,862 --> 01:08:05,821
Look at that. Son of a bitch.
He can't stay there, the fire's runnin'.

649
01:08:05,862 --> 01:08:08,934
If he can get to Crane Lake
before the fire does, he'II be fine.

650
01:08:08,982 --> 01:08:14,773
Oh, yeah? What's that? CaII the
weather service, see if it's a coId front.

651
01:08:14,822 --> 01:08:19,737
If it is, those _o fires wiII coIIide
and suck aII the oxygen out ofthe air.

652
01:08:19,782 --> 01:08:22,740
He won't survive, not even in the Iake.

653
01:08:22,782 --> 01:08:24,773
He'II be in the middIe of a firestorm.

654
01:08:26,982 --> 01:08:28,859
Dammit!

655
01:08:29,862 --> 01:08:32,899
The fire iumped ahead of us.
It's movin' faster than I thought.

656
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:38,733
- We'II iust have to wait for it to burn out.
- They're right behind us. We can't go back.

657
01:08:40,782 --> 01:08:43,819
You got anything in that pouch?
Besides eggs?

658
01:08:43,862 --> 01:08:45,818
A Zippo.

659
01:08:45,862 --> 01:08:49,935
- Come on, what do you got?
- I got binocs, karabiners, rope.

660
01:08:49,982 --> 01:08:52,894
Good. I got an idea.

661
01:08:56,742 --> 01:09:00,940
So, what the heII were you tyin' to do here?!
Burn us?! Ha-ha!

662
01:09:00,982 --> 01:09:03,735
Nice ty, asshoIe!

663
01:09:03,782 --> 01:09:05,818
Don't you ever shut up?

664
01:09:20,822 --> 01:09:22,892
Run! They're coming!

665
01:09:25,982 --> 01:09:27,813
Jesse!

666
01:09:33,822 --> 01:09:34,857
Jesse!

667
01:09:34,902 --> 01:09:39,930
Hey, what'd you run away for? I gave you
my word you were gonna be aII right.

668
01:09:39,982 --> 01:09:42,780
- Come on.
- Jesse!

669
01:09:42,822 --> 01:09:44,972
- Come on, I ain't gonna hurt you.
- Look out!

670
01:09:47,862 --> 01:09:49,898
My Ieg, you asshoIe!

671
01:09:54,942 --> 01:09:56,773
Argh!

HoId your fire, you crazy bastard!
He's hoIdin' me up!

673
01:10:00,862 --> 01:10:02,932
You want some ofthis?

674
01:10:03,942 --> 01:10:05,978
Come on!

675
01:10:10,782 --> 01:10:11,851
No!

676
01:10:16,982 --> 01:10:17,971
Aaagghh!

677
01:10:21,902 --> 01:10:23,938
You inconsiderate son of a bitch!

678
01:10:23,982 --> 01:10:27,736
Why the heII were you shootin' at him?
He was hoIdin' me up!

679
01:10:27,782 --> 01:10:30,819
You shot me in my arm,
you psycho mothesucker!

680
01:10:30,862 --> 01:10:33,820
Cut me down, you seIfish asshoIe!
Right now!

681
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,773
With pIeasure.

682
01:10:37,782 --> 01:10:38,931
Argh!

683
01:10:44,982 --> 01:10:48,861
Hey. Hey. What's the matter? Does that hurt?

684
01:10:48,942 --> 01:10:51,740
You didn't reaIIy think I'd share my money

685
01:10:51,782 --> 01:10:54,933
with a piece-of-shit IowIife rapist
Iike yourseIf, did you?

686
01:10:54,982 --> 01:10:56,813
Huh?

687
01:10:58,782 --> 01:11:00,898
What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?

688
01:11:02,822 --> 01:11:06,815
Hey, smokeiumper! You stiII aIive?!

689
01:11:09,942 --> 01:11:11,933
Hey, Jesse!

690
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:19,973
ProbabIy not.

691
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:25,853
(woman whímpers)

692
01:11:25,982 --> 01:11:28,940
Ifyou are, I got your girI here.

693
01:11:30,782 --> 01:11:32,773
Come and get her.

694
01:11:57,982 --> 01:11:59,973

695
01:12:03,942 --> 01:12:05,933
You know, I'm hurt.

696
01:12:08,902 --> 01:12:11,780
I reaIIy thought that you might thank me.

697
01:12:12,822 --> 01:12:15,780
- What?
- Nothing profuse or anything.

698
01:12:15,822 --> 01:12:19,815
I mean iust a simpIe IittIe ''Thank you
vey much for kiIIin' that rapist guy.''

699
01:12:19,862 --> 01:12:21,853
But is that what I get, huh? No.

700
01:12:21,902 --> 01:12:25,941
No, what I get is aII this sIow-waIkin'
I-gotta-tie-my-shoes crap.

701
01:12:25,982 --> 01:12:28,940
I warn you, don't test me.

702
01:12:28,982 --> 01:12:34,773
Now we're either a happy coupIe Iost in a
huge disaster or I'm the Lone fuckin' Ranger.

703
01:12:34,822 --> 01:12:38,815
WaIk fast or I'm gonna shoot you
in the head. Your choice.

704
01:12:42,822 --> 01:12:44,858
ExceIIent choice.

705
01:13:08,742 --> 01:13:11,893
You know, I reaIIy don't Iike peopIe
jumpin' outta my heIicopter!

706
01:13:11,942 --> 01:13:13,853
Yeah, yeah.

707
01:13:14,862 --> 01:13:17,854
We shouIdn't be up in this weather anyway.

708
01:13:17,902 --> 01:13:21,895
I can't hear you, Andy.
There's somethin' I gotta do.

709
01:13:33,902 --> 01:13:35,893
Move it.

710
01:13:58,982 --> 01:14:00,779
Jesus, Wynt!

711
01:14:00,822 --> 01:14:04,861

D4.

714
01:14:11,942 --> 01:14:14,979
No one's that smart. Not even you, Wynt.

715
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:19,891
Why'd you do it?

716
01:14:19,942 --> 01:14:23,855
It was supposed to be a controIIed burn
for a deveIoper. I needed the cash.

717
01:14:23,862 --> 01:14:28,890
Smokeiumping was aII I had. I've got nothin'
Ie_ now. I didn't know about the prison break.

718
01:14:28,942 --> 01:14:32,776

Race you down, Chief.

724
01:14:57,862 --> 01:14:59,853
Not this time, Chief.

725
01:15:00,902 --> 01:15:03,939
Move it! Get to the front
ofthe boat and untie it.

726
01:15:11,782 --> 01:15:14,979
