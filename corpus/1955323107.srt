1
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:43,542
- So, Richard.
- Yeah?

2
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,278
- Your profile picture
looked a little different,

3
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,279
I got to say.

4
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,114
- Oh, very good eye.

5
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:50,416
Good eye, my lady.

6
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:53,452
Yes, that picture is,
in fact, Nathan Fillion

7
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:55,187
from television's "firefly,"

8
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,056
but everyone's always
saying how we're doppelgangers

9
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:59,525
and we look exactly alike,
so I just kind of let it ride.

10
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:00,692
- People tell you that?
- Yeah.

11
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:01,727
Yeah, my mom.

12
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:02,795
- Anybody else?
- Nope.

13
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:04,096
- Okay.

14
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:05,197
Hi!
- Hi.

15
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,532
How are you two tonight?
- Hi.

16
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:08,267
- Are you the chef?
- I am the waitress.

17
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,368
- Very cool.

18
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,337
- Yeah, so what can I get you?

19
00:01:12,339 --> 00:01:13,705
- I'll start?
- Sure.

20
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:15,841
- I am gonna do
a white Russian to drink.

21
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:16,842
You know what?

22
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,410
Let's make it a double.

23
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,680
Or do you do bottle service?
- Not really.

24
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,450
- Okay, well, then I'll take
a triple white Russian,

25
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:27,653
and I'm also gonna do
the eggplant Parmesan

26
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:29,788
but with vodka sauce,
if I could.

27
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,390
Maybe an extra shot in there
or something.

28
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,724
- Okay, thank you.
And for you?

29
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:36,195
- I will have the, um...

30
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:37,362
I'm gonna stick with the water

31
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,497
and I will have two

32
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:40,866
complimentary bread baskets,
please.

33
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,367
Unless you wanted to, uh...

34
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,635
- Oh, no, I'm all set.
- Make it three?

35
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:45,537
- Okay, great.
Be right back.

36
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,538
Both: Whoo!

37
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,840
Jinx.

38
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:49,608
- Yep.

39
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,543
So I think your profile said

40
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,245
you work in
the film industry, right?

41
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:54,279
- It does say that.

42
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,447
- Yeah.
That's cool.

43
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,448
- Yeah.
- That's interesting.

44
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,616
- I work at take two video.

45
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,518
I'm the manager over there.
Yeah.

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,588
We are actually the last store
in the country

47
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,323
that still rents VHS tapes.

48
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:07,126
- Cool.
- And you work with teeth?

49
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,327
- I do.

50
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:09,595
I am a orthodontist assistant.

51
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:10,762
- Fascinating,
because I actually have

52
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,431
a bit of an issue.

53
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,867
I... I've had this weird thing
in my mouth for, like,

54
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:17,436
18 months for so, and I think
it might be a popcorn kernel,

55
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:19,238
but I haven't been to a movie
in, like, years.

56
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,639
- We're gonna do this?

57
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,207
- It feels like a kernel,
but it could also be ham.

58
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,742
It smells like ham.
- Yeah.

59
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:24,743
- It does, right?
- Yeah.

60
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,445
- So maybe it's ham.

61
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,914
I ask because if it is ham
and it's hardened in there,

62
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,883
at what point does it just
become a tooth

63
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:33,485
and do I start treating it
like a tooth?

64
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,834
- Hey, Karen, it's Kate.

65
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,503
Hey.

66
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,705
I am following up about fondue
night on the 12th.

67
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:29,908
My place, 7:00.
What do you say?

68
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,310
Oh.

69
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:32,644
Yeah, don't worry about it.

70
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,813
We will do it another time.

71
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:36,548
Megan!
Hey, it's Kate fields.

72
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,317
Hi.

73
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,386
I saw that you're coming
to knitting club on Monday.

74
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,888
Oh, really?

75
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,390
Oh, I thought you said you were
attending on Facebook.

76
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,959
That's a bummer.

77
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,695
Hey, I'm just calling to make
sure that you and Ellen

78
00:03:49,697 --> 00:03:51,597
actually read the book
for this week.

79
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,865
Yeah, no, "great expectations"
isn't that great.

80
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,668
Well, it doesn't matter.

81
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,972
You want to just come hang out
or something?

82
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:00,973
Totally get it.

83
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:02,007
Soon.
Yeah.

84
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,575
Totally.

85
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,776
Bye.

86
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,514
Hey!
Marco!

87
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:10,983
Brian!
Hey, it's Kate.

88
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,618
Yeah.

89
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,353
Hey, I'm just calling
to get a final headcount

90
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:17,422
for the dinner party
next Friday.

91
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,324
No problem.

92
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,526
We'll do it another time.

93
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,262
Okay.
Bye.

94
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,700
Okay, but if you guys already
have plans, then don't...

95
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,535
<i>- we'll cancel them!
Consider them canceled.</i>

96
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:32,771
Both: Taco Tuesday,
taco Tuesday,

97
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,506
taco Tuesday!

98
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,575
- I don't understand
how you just do raw onions.

99
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:37,643
- They're good for you.

100
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,544
- Oh, hey!
Guys, I was thinking.

101
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,447
For Saturday, what do you guys
think about either fondue

102
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,549
or medieval times?

103
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:46,785
- I can't do fondue, Kate.
I am lactose intolerant.

104
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,620
- Yeah, and I'm
theme restaurant intolerant.

105
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,988
- All right, no worries.

106
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,824
Just yelp said they're fun
for birthdays, so...

107
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:53,892
- Mm.

108
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,662
- You bitches forgot
my birthday!

109
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:57,663
- What?
No.

110
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:58,897
- Yeah!

111
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,399
- Hey, does anybody
need a refill?

112
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,400
Or, like,
maybe two new best friends?

113
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,834
'Cause we are the worst.

114
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,469
- No, no, no, no.
I, um, I didn't forget.

115
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,772
I was going to surprise you,
so you ruined it.

116
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:07,939
- Evie, what day is my birthday?

117
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,442
- Fri...

118
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:11,643
- s...
Both: Saturday.

119
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,711
- Fri-Saturday?

120
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:13,945
- I was saying, "for Saturday."

121
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:16,548
I had something planned
for Saturday,

122
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,452
but I should just cancel it now
because classic Kate found out.

123
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:21,753
- Good 'cause it's not
a big deal.

124
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,322
- Kate fields.

125
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:26,758
It's your 30th birthday!

126
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,894
- Yes, and I don't want to make
a big deal about it.

127
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,562
- No, let's make a big deal.
Let's have a party!

128
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:31,563
Yes, please!

129
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:32,831
Please let us throw you a party.

130
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,433
Please, please, please.
It's what I do.

131
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:37,035
- Mm, no thank you,
but if you insist on going out,

132
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,804
I'll break out this bad boy.

133
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:40,806
Red lobster, baby!

134
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,107
25 big ones,

135
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,710
courtesy of aunt Meryl, who...

136
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,345
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

137
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:47,612
- Is a freak.
Officially.

138
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:48,914
- Wow.

139
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,048
Well, I'll get excited
if there's that

140
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,450
cheesecake factory gift card
in here.

141
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:52,851
- I think there is,
but I used it.

142
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,353
- What is this?
It's from Lincoln high.

143
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,854
- I don't know.
They probably want money.

144
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,056
Are we old enough that schools
want money from us now?

145
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,591
- I think you are, technically.
Yeah.

146
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:00,859
- Oh, okay.

147
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,095
That's how it's gonna be.

148
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:05,497
- Shut the front door!

149
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,498
Um...
- What?

150
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,499
Did I not graduate?

151
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,034
- No, okay, um...

152
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:11,103
Do you remember in... i think it
was sophomore English

153
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:12,637
when Mr. Robbins had us
write letters

154
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,905
to our 30-year-old selves?

155
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:15,474
- Vaguely.

156
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:18,643
- Yeah, well, uh,
he actually mails them.

157
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:19,911
- Oh, my god.
- Stop it.

158
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,046
No!
Evie!

159
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:22,114
Don't!
- Please read it.

160
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:23,115
Kate.

161
00:06:23,117 --> 00:06:24,616
- Sit down.

162
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:26,058
- Okay.
We're really doing this, huh?

163
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:29,588
- "Dear 30-year-old Kate."

164
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,856
- Oh, wow.

165
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,057
You dot your "I" s
with little stars.

166
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,058
That's precious.

167
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,059
- "Hey, Kate.

168
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,828
"Congrats on surviving till 30.

169
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:37,829
You go, girl!"

170
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:38,830
- "You go, girl"?

171
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,399
- It was the early 2000s.

172
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,933
And "you go, girl" is timeless.
Come on.

173
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,468
- That's debatable.

174
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,537
"You will be
a super successful orthodontist

175
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,639
with your own practice."

176
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,708
- Cool.
Teenage me's already 0 for 1.

177
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,810
- "There will be a little one
to take care of

178
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:55,180
or at least a bun in the oven."

179
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,882
- I don't even use my oven.

180
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:58,550
Literally or metaphorically.

181
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,886
- "You will have the greatest
guy in the world.

182
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:04,556
"He'll be handsome and sweet
and funny.

183
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,859
"I have no doubt you will have
the most incredible life.

184
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,061
I'll see you then."

185
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,763
- Yeah, that last line
was pretty creepy.

186
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,801
- "Enjoy your
30th b-day blowout bash, Kate.

187
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:17,202
I'm sure it will be a night
to remember."

188
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:18,870
See?
Look.

189
00:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,972
Your 16-year-old self
wanted a party, so please.

190
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:22,908
- Absolutely not.

191
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,076
In fact, I'm gonna go on record
right now and say that we're not

192
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,079
doing anything for my birthday,
so you guys make other plans.

193
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,748
Oh, there's a p.S.

194
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,118
"P.S. Ashley Driscoll
can eat shit."

195
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,020
Classy.
- Oh, Ashley Driscoll.

196
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:36,721
- You know, on my first day
at Lincoln high,

197
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,490
Ashley Driscoll told me
my bowl cut looked like

198
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:40,759
a turtle was sitting on my head,

199
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,160
and then she threw lettuce
at me.

200
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:43,962
- Well, you still have
a bowl cut,

201
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,064
but it's an edgier bowl cut.

202
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,466
- There's a bowl cut
in my heart.

203
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,034
- She called me a theaturd.

204
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:50,569
- What is that?

205
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:53,238
- It's a combination
of the word "theater"

206
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,806
and the word "turd."

207
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,109
- Yeah, she was a bitch,
but she dated Peter Finch.

208
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,911
Peter Finch was so hot.

209
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,546
Wow.

210
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,114
- Oh, that's my ride.

211
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,517
Did you still want us
to drop you off?

212
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,918
- Yeah.
Yeah, I should go.

213
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,220
Todd hates it when I'm late.

214
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:09,888
- All right.
Well, I'll see you guys later.

215
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,690
- I'll see you this weekend at
the party...

216
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,658
Both: Party, party, party,
party, party, party.

217
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,495
Yeah, I can't do it.

218
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,029
- That was wet.
- Sorry.

219
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:22,534
So I can throw you
a party, right?

220
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:23,535
- Nope.

221
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:25,871
- Got it.

222
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:27,072
- Have fun with the dishes.

223
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,573
- Our gift to you.

224
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,021
<i>- Hey, Kate.</i>

225
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,189
<i>Congrats on surviving till 30.</i>

226
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,857
<i>You go, girl.</i>

227
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,093
<i>You will be
a super successful orthodontist</i>

228
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:49,828
<i>with your own practice.</i>

229
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,696
<i>There will be a little one
to take care of</i>

230
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,766
<i>or at least a bun in the oven.</i>

231
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,668
<i>You'll have the greatest guy
in the world.</i>

232
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,037
<i>He'll be handsome and sweet
and funny.</i>

233
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,673
<i>You will have the most
incredible life.</i>

234
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,174
<i>I'll see you then.</i>

235
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,583
- Excuse me.

236
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:14,553
- Thank you.
My card wasn't working.

237
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:15,720
- Oh, I'm sorry.

238
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,822
I can't let you
into the building.

239
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:18,990
- What?

240
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:19,991
- I have no proof
that you work here.

241
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:21,326
- No, I have a card.

242
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,995
- But it doesn't work,
so could be a fake.

243
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,196
I'm sorry.

244
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,132
- Are you Ashley Driscoll?
- Yes.

245
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:28,767
If you want to schedule
an appointment,

246
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:29,834
you can call my office.

247
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,836
- No, um, it's Kate fields.

248
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:35,006
From Lincoln high.

249
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:37,809
Braceface.

250
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:38,910
- Braceface!

251
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,779
- Oh, my god!
Look at you.

252
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,682
You look, you know,
so much older.

253
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,684
- Thanks.

254
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,185
I did not know you worked
in the building.

255
00:09:47,187 --> 00:09:48,820
- Yeah.

256
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,956
My real estate business
got too big for my old office,

257
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,891
so now I have
the whole top floor.

258
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:54,659
I feel like Oprah.

259
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:55,961
- Whole floor?
- Mm-hmm.

260
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:57,062
- Cool.

261
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:58,229
- Anyway,
it was good to see you.

262
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,264
- You too.

263
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,765
- Oh, I'm sorry.

264
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,834
I still can't let you
in the building.

265
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:03,835
- Are you serious?

266
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:04,903
- It's building policy.

267
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:06,171
You have to have a working card.

268
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,839
It opens in 20 minutes though.

269
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,274
Anyway, it was really good
to see you.

270
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,809
Don't be a stranger.

271
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:11,876
Bye!

272
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:24,823
- So how did the date go?

273
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:28,793
Kate?

274
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:29,961
Kate.
Hey.

275
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:32,631
How was your date
the other night?

276
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,265
<i>- It's just that usually
there's a kid's menu.</i>

277
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,967
- Kate.

278
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,802
- Can't do crunchy stuff
'cause of the ham tooth.

279
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,270
- Yeah.
Ham tooth.

280
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,406
- Sop it down.
Get it soggy.

281
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:43,174
- Oh, well, that's a...
That's a interesting ring

282
00:10:43,176 --> 00:10:44,342
you have there.

283
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,877
- Oh, very perceptive of you,
my lady.

284
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,878
Very good.

285
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,980
Um, on the weekends, I go goth.

286
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,316
- I'm sorry?
- On the weekends, I go goth.

287
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,417
- Goth.
- Goth.

288
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:53,818
- Goth?
- I go goth.

289
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,186
- People still go goth?

290
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:56,187
- Oh, yeah.
- Really?

291
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:57,689
- Yeah.

292
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:58,957
I host a rave
in my mom's basement, like,

293
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,225
every second Saturday.

294
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,926
Full goth.
Full goth.

295
00:11:01,928 --> 00:11:03,728
Yeah.

296
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,131
I know that Richard
may seem to be milquetoast

297
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:08,700
and boring and plain,
but on the weekends,

298
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:13,071
he hatches into raven.

299
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,072
- Raven.

300
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,273
Raven.

301
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:17,208
- Raven?
- A little more roundness to it.

302
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,410
Should feel like, "raven."

303
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:19,411
Raven.

304
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:20,912
- Little bit more bass in there.

305
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:22,113
- That's as low as I can go.
- Okay.

306
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,248
- Okay.

307
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,683
- Is that gonna be a problem
for you?

308
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:25,884
- No.

309
00:11:25,886 --> 00:11:27,018
- Well,
because that is my social life,

310
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,019
and a lot of people
get intimidated

311
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,020
because it's so cool...

312
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,789
- Oh, god, no.
- Great!

313
00:11:30,791 --> 00:11:32,724
Because this is going
fabulously, so if you're okay...

314
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:33,725
- okay, no.
Richard, really quick...

315
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:34,959
- yeah?
Raven.

316
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,394
- Okay, I'm sorry, raven.
- Yeah.

317
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,929
My ex-boyfriend just walked
through the door.

318
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,397
- Oh.
- Yeah.

319
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,732
So I'm just gonna excuse myself.
- Say no more.

320
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,000
You want to make him
really jealous.

321
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:43,101
- No, that's not at all
what I want.

322
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,202
- Coming in to touch
the shoulder.

323
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,270
- Nope.
- Touch the shoulder.

324
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:46,271
- Nope.
- Permission to touch...

325
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:47,272
- Nope.
- Okay, wow.

326
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:48,807
Whoa, saucy lady.

327
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:50,175
Oh, you really
want to make him jealous.

328
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:51,209
It's our anniversary.

329
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,844
Not a big deal.

330
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:53,845
Hey, listen.
Kate?

331
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:54,946
I think he's gone.

332
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:55,947
He took her to the patio, so...

333
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:56,948
- What?
- Hi.

334
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,750
- Hi.

335
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,185
- He took her to the patio,
so I think you're in the clear.

336
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:01,186
- He's gone?
- Yeah.

337
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,188
- Are you sure?
- Whoa.

338
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,322
That was awesome!

339
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,157
Look, so, uh...

340
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,860
I don't feel like I really get
along with most people in life.

341
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:09,861
- Really?
- Yeah.

342
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:10,962
- Wow.

343
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,363
- But the thing is,
I do feel like

344
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,199
you and I are on the exact...

345
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:17,502
Same exact wavelength, so...

346
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:19,170
Congratulations.

347
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,171
You're getting another date.

348
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,873
- Nope.
That...

349
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,795
You're supposed to ask me
if I want another date.

350
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:26,878
You don't just tell me,
you know?

351
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,514
- Mm, my litmus test is like,
"what would Nathan Fillion do?"

352
00:12:29,516 --> 00:12:32,417
And would Nathan Fillion
ask politely, or would he say...

353
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:33,785
- you know what?

354
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,120
I think he would.
- Would he?

355
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:36,888
- Yeah, he seems like
a really nice guy.

356
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,289
- Look, I don't know.
I'm just his doppelganger, so...

357
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,290
- uh, debatable.

358
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:40,458
- Fridays are no good for me

359
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,860
because those
are my falconry Fridays

360
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,027
where I play with my falcons.

361
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:45,296
Saturday is d, d&d Saturday.

362
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,931
The third d, of course, for...

363
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:47,932
- Drinking?
- Domino's.

364
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,501
- Got it.

365
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:51,436
- Every single Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, however,

366
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,071
until 2019, wide open.

367
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,272
- Happy birthday.

368
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:55,507
- Thank you.

369
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,176
Thank you, chef.

370
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,377
I like to tell them

371
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,279
it's my birthday
for the free cake.

372
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,982
<i>- Gauze.</i>

373
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,016
Kate.
- Hmm?

374
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:06,918
- Gauze.
- Oh.

375
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,020
- You almost choked on
your own blood, but don't worry.

376
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:11,089
We got you.

377
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,223
Sorry.

378
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,268
- Sparkling grape juice
just in case there's a miracle

379
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,335
brewing in there.

380
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,038
- Todd, I'm proud of you.

381
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,374
As of today, Todd was promoted
to vice president

382
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:31,543
of paralegal management
at Jones and associates.

383
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:32,811
All right.

384
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,245
- Hear, hear!
All: Hear.

385
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:36,856
- Oh, that's real crystal.

386
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,450
- Mmm.
Mm!

387
00:13:39,452 --> 00:13:41,319
I have an idea.

388
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:44,222
Why don't we all head up to
the mountain house this weekend

389
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,890
to do some celebratory skiing?

390
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,425
- Yes.

391
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,595
Yes, I've been wanting to break
out my new Fischer XCS.

392
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:52,831
Hunter at work is so jealous.

393
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,899
I can't wait to test
those puppies out on the powder.

394
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:58,970
- Babe, it's Kate's birthday
this weekend.

395
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,506
- Evie, how often do I get
a promotion?

396
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,075
- Every six months.
It's your dad's company.

397
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:07,011
- Exactly, so just try to be
a little bit more considerate.

398
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:16,387
- So, Evie, how is
the fundraising coming along?

399
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:19,624
You know, for the bald...
Llamas?

400
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:22,493
- Alpacas with alopecia.

401
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,062
- Oh, is... is that a thing?

402
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,530
- Yeah, apparently.

403
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,433
Yeah, I had no idea either,
but they called me.

404
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:33,905
And, actually, I have already
raised over half of their goal.

405
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:36,007
Hear, hear.

406
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,508
- Well, I think
it's very important

407
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,510
for housewives
to keep their hobbies.

408
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,012
- Oh, it pays.

409
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,481
Because it's my job, so it pays.

410
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:48,586
- Oh.

411
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:49,954
- Lay off, mom.

412
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,389
Okay?

413
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,591
If Evie wants to make
a little extra spending money,

414
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,593
who am I to stop her?

415
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,628
Even though I've offered.

416
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,275
<i>Male announcer: So grab
a friend and make some plans.</i>

417
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:12,010
<i>Cabins are filling up fast.</i>

418
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:14,212
<i>Michiana, exit 212.</i>

419
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,315
<i>- Are you ready to get real</i>

420
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:18,316
<i>about real estate?</i>

421
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:19,417
- Oh, my god.

422
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,452
<i>- Hi, I'm Ashley Driscoll</i>

423
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:24,522
<i>and I'm here to make
your dreams a reality.</i>

424
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,157
<i>Let's raise the roof</i>

425
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:29,394
<i>on finding you an ideal home.</i>

426
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:32,096
<i>You know, lots of realtors

427
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,064
<i>find a great house,</i>

428
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:34,499
<i>but I'm here...</i>

429
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:37,335
- Throw me a party.

430
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,304
- Seriously?
- Yep.

431
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:40,939
Let's check one thing
off that letter.

432
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:41,706
Throw me a damn party.

433
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:42,974
- I'll make t-shirts!

434
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,143
- No, no.
Nothing crazy.

435
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:47,245
Let's keep it super casual.

436
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:50,448
Evie, do you even have time
to throw this so last minute?

437
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,482
Evie?

438
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,717
<i>Evie?</i>

439
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:53,985
- Sorry, I blacked out
from excitement.

440
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:55,653
Kate, of course!

441
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,488
I once put together the Alpha
sigma tiki mixer in two hours

442
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,190
complete with a full
roasted pig.

443
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:02,260
- All right, well, seriously,
keep it very small.

444
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,062
Classy, even,

445
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:05,496
and Charlie, I'm counting on you
to keep Evie in line.

446
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,597
- Never do.
- <i>Okay.</i>

447
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:07,999
Cool.

448
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,300
I will put it in my calendar.

449
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,568
This is gonna be really fun.

450
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,538
- I think I just found us
a venue.

451
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,278
- Go team!

452
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:31,422
Morning, sunshine.

453
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,724
- Mm.
Morning.

454
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,393
- Looks like one of us
had some fun last night.

455
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,562
You got a pair of panties
in your front pocket.

456
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:38,997
- Oh, they're my spare pair.

457
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,531
Okay.

458
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:42,433
We are starting off
fixing a snapped wire

459
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:45,169
on a permanent retainer,
then there's an extraction

460
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,371
of Kelly Grossman's back molar.

461
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,039
I know.

462
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:52,143
Two braces checkups
and retainer fitting finale.

463
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,745
What?

464
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,347
You look like the Grinch.
What?

465
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,316
- Dan is our first client.

466
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,786
- And?
- Well, he's cute.

467
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:04,122
I think you should invite him
to your party.

468
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:05,590
- I can't invite a patient
to my party.

469
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:07,425
- Why not?

470
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,260
- Uh, because one of us has to
keep a level of professionalism

471
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,261
around here.

472
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,462
- Oh, come on.

473
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:13,031
It's one pair of panties.

474
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,399
These are not my panties.

475
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:18,169
- So, Dan, are you
still a little nervous

476
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,437
when it comes to
the dental stuff?

477
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,172
- Oh, no.

478
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,241
I think you're confusing me
with somebody else.

479
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,743
- Okay, well, I'm gonna need
my arm back to work.

480
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,111
- Oh.

481
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:29,280
- It's okay.
- Okay, Dan.

482
00:17:29,282 --> 00:17:31,582
So it says here
that we are giving you

483
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:35,386
a new front grille that says
"ass" and "shaker."

484
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,654
- Oh, no.
I, uh...

485
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:38,256
- I'm just kidding.

486
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,091
I'm fixing the wire
on that broken retainer.

487
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,659
- Right.
- Relax.

488
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:44,162
- All right, I've got good news
and bad news for you.

489
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,497
The good news is that
this is not gonna hurt at all,

490
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,166
so you don't even need
an anesthetic,

491
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:51,169
but the bad news is that
Jules has no medical moral code,

492
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:52,703
so she's gonna let me
gas you up.

493
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,105
- Yeah, let's party.

494
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:55,373
- All right.
Take a deep breath.

495
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,243
Good.

496
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,745
Thank you.

497
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,547
Yeah, I don't know why I got
so nervous there.

498
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,283
I mean, normally
I'm extremely macho and tough.

499
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:06,517
- Mm.

500
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,653
No, but seriously.

501
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:09,654
I'm not even afraid of spiders.

502
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,322
- Hm.
Wow.

503
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:14,225
- I mean, snakes, however,
they can suck a duck.

504
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,864
- I'm sorry,
that was not very chivalrous.

505
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,601
Chivalrous.
That's a funny word.

506
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,203
Chivalrous.

507
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,838
- Maybe I should use
that nitrous as my plus one

508
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,439
to your birthday.

509
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,081
- I don't know.
I heard he's pretty gassy.

510
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,812
- Oh, you found your audience.

511
00:18:34,814 --> 00:18:36,714
- It's your birthday?

512
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,116
Happy birthday!

513
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,584
- Thank you.

514
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,220
- Oh, you should come
to her birthday tomorrow.

515
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:44,622
- Oh, I would love to!

516
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,657
Wait, how do I get there?

517
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,293
- Do you have a car?

518
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,895
- I do!

519
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:53,431
I can drive there.

520
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:54,465
- You are a drug dealer.

521
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,666
- Yeah, I know.

522
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,735
Gassy.

523
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,205
- Evie, let's go!

524
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:02,874
You can put your face on
in the car.

525
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,349
- Oh.
Sorry, guys.

526
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:12,350
It's work drama.

527
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,918
Hey, Linda.

528
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,620
<i>Just about to roll out for
the weekend with the family.</i>

529
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:17,588
What's up?

530
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,558
Whoa, Linda, I can't understand
you when you're talking so fast.

531
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,763
Oh, my god.

532
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:26,831
Oh, my god!

533
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,468
He's gonna be okay, right?

534
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,271
What do you mean
you can't find him?

535
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:35,606
- Oh, I get it.
We're lying.

536
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,807
- Yes!

537
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,309
Of course!
I will be right there.

538
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,744
Yes, I will be there in person.

539
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,245
- Yeah, big old lie.
Cool.

540
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:42,680
Sounds fun.
- Okay.

541
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,553
Oh, my god.

542
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:50,388
I'm... I'm so sorry, you guys.

543
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,889
I can't go.

544
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:54,592
Elliot is missing.

545
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:55,960
- Who's Elliot?

546
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:59,463
- He's the face
of the alopecia campaign.

547
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:00,898
- So he's a llama?

548
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,800
- No, Todd, he's an alpaca.

549
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,502
Look, I am so sorry.

550
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,572
I was really looking forward
to going cross-country skiing

551
00:20:07,574 --> 00:20:10,408
with the skis and the knees.

552
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,576
- It's okay, honey.

553
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,277
I'll just cancel
the private lesson

554
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,713
I set up for you
with the bronze medalist.

555
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:19,417
Let me just make sure I can
cancel his flight from Norway.

556
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:22,653
Airlines are so great
to deal with.

557
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,259
I knew this was gonna happen.

558
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,261
I just had the sense
that she would...

559
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,762
- are you seriously
not gonna come?

560
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,331
- Work needs me.

561
00:20:34,334 --> 00:20:36,234
- What?
What is that?

562
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,970
- It's just I want a wife
who will celebrate my victories

563
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:42,006
with me, but instead I have one
who's running all over town

564
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:44,709
looking for a loose llama.

565
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:45,843
- Alpaca.

566
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:47,912
- Sh-paca.

567
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,580
Just give me a kiss
so my parents don't think

568
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,648
that we're fighting.

569
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,559
Behave yourself.

570
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,438
No, no, no, no.

571
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,507
Those jell-o shots,
they go in the kitchen.

572
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,843
And the kegs,
they go in the man cave.

573
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:21,979
And that... that liquor luge,
just wherever it fits!

574
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,048
- Hi.

575
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,285
- Oh.

576
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,386
Hello.

577
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,022
Are you selling
girl scout cookies?

578
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:33,791
- No, I bring in the mail
for the Jones

579
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,792
when they're out of town, so...

580
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,927
- Oh, cool.
Cool.

581
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,497
Well, I'm their son's wife,
Evie.

582
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:40,765
Nice to meet you.

583
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,466
I'm gonna be staying here
this weekend.

584
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,934
- Cool.

585
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,003
- Yeah, just throwing a little
get together for a friend.

586
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,306
30-year-old birthday party.

587
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:49,740
You wouldn't know anything
about that, right?

588
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,375
You're what, college?
- High... high school.

589
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:52,443
- High school.
High school.

590
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:53,577
- High school.
- Mm-hmm.

591
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:54,979
Cool.
Well, it's very low-key.

592
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,380
You know, small.

593
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:58,482
Nothing that the Jones
would need to know

594
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,751
or be worried about, so...

595
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:01,986
- Cool.

596
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:05,656
- Okay, you can invite
two friends

597
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,426
if you don't say anything
about it.

598
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:09,994
- I don't know
if I'd have two friends...

599
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,562
- five.
Five friends, but that's it.

600
00:22:11,564 --> 00:22:14,031
And it doesn't leave this house.
You got it?

601
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,099
- What just happened?

602
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:16,801
- Exactly.

603
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:19,337
Yes.

604
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,538
- Do you still want me to...

605
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,872
- yes, thank you.
Right there is great.

606
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:24,442
And can I get six jell-o shots
upstairs please?

607
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:25,776
Just orange.

608
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:30,915
- I stayed up all night
doing these.

609
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,550
- Yeah, I know.

610
00:22:32,552 --> 00:22:35,419
That's why I'm paying you
time and a half.

611
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:38,055
- Rufus, what the hell?

612
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:39,490
- "Partee tyme."

613
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,929
- I'm, like, 70% sure that's not
how you spell "party" or "time."

614
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:48,032
- Okay, I just thought, like,
"hey, who wants to wear a shirt

615
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,834
that's spelled correctly,"
you know?

616
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,902
We live in the digital age.

617
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,373
Spelling is, like, subjective.

618
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,375
You know?

619
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,944
Okay, I did these last night

620
00:22:59,946 --> 00:23:01,045
after a guidance counselors
show.

621
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:02,513
I was super drunk.

622
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,382
- Dude, can't keep messing up
like this.

623
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:05,683
I mean, remember last week

624
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,385
with the all saints softball
shirts you ruined?

625
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:10,688
I changed my band name
to the all taints.

626
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,556
We sold out!

627
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,959
- I know, it's an awesome shirt,
but that's not the point.

628
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:17,495
You know, this business,
this is my passion.

629
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:19,497
I just need to know that, like,
you're in my corner.

630
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:20,731
- I am in your corner.

631
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,466
Any corner.
Pick a corner.

632
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:23,934
I'm in that corner.

633
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:26,404
- It's in three hours!
Are you kidding me?

634
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,805
Ugh, fine.

635
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:29,907
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

636
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,675
I know that Kate
wanted some classy stuff,

637
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:34,412
so I ordered one of those naked
Sushi girls for the party.

638
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,913
- I'm still waiting
on the classy part.

639
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,415
- But she canceled just now.

640
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:39,817
Ah.
Hi.

641
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,118
- Hey, lady.

642
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,020
I'm headed your way.

643
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,155
<i>- On your way?
It's, like, 6:00.</i>

644
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:45,790
<i>What are you, in seventh grade?</i>

645
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:47,158
- Well, I don't know.
I thought I could help.

646
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,793
- What?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

647
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,494
We have everything
under control.

648
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:51,862
- Okay, well, I'm gonna grab
a coffee.

649
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,030
Do you want me
to pick anything up?

650
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:54,698
- I don't know.
Milk?

651
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,167
- You didn't get milk
for my white Russian?

652
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:57,868
<i>- I forgot to put that
on the catering list.</i>

653
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,103
- Caterers?

654
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,671
Evie, this is supposed
to be small.

655
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:01,972
- It's gonna be!
<i>Very small.</i>

656
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,974
Small food, small drinks,
small caterers.

657
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:06,110
<i>This party is gonna be so small
that you'll hardly see it.</i>

658
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,511
- Okay, well, I'm headed over.

659
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,480
- Great!

660
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:10,748
Okay, people, double time!

661
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,550
Red eagle lands in one hour!

662
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,192
- Looking good, ash.

663
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:22,827
- Hey.

664
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,495
Could you get me something
to eat?

665
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:25,563
- Yeah, of course.

666
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:27,064
What do you want?
- Great.

667
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,867
Let me get a cup of coffee
and then barbecue lay's,

668
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:32,203
and then, like, a apple,
and then something savory,

669
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:34,138
but you can choose.

670
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,506
- Anything else?

671
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:37,041
- Two crullers,
a pack of cigars,

672
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:39,577
maybe, like, a king size
whatchamacallit bar,

673
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:42,980
some gummy bears, and then...

674
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,715
Get yourself something.

675
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,809
That's stupid.

676
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,250
Oh, my god.

677
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,091
It's actually happening!

678
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,960
- What's happening?

679
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:05,996
Hey, what the heck are you doing
with a picture of my girlfriend

680
00:26:05,998 --> 00:26:06,997
on your computer?

681
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:08,599
- Mom!

682
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,000
- Oh, widdle baby
wants to talk to his mom.

683
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:11,669
Tough luck 'cause she just left

684
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:13,270
to buy me some more
push-up pops.

685
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:15,839
What is the deal
with this party?

686
00:26:15,841 --> 00:26:17,575
My invite must've got lost
in the mail.

687
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:18,909
- It's an email, so...

688
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,244
- I don't think mom
would approve of you

689
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:23,013
going to a party with alcohol,
would she?

690
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:26,884
Unless, of course, you brought
your big brother as a chaperone.

691
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:28,586
- Fine.
- Perfect.

692
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:30,654
Pick me up at 8:00?
Great.

693
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:32,156
- You... you live here.

694
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,893
- All right, you just keep
doing that, buddy.

695
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:38,696
- Oh, yeah.
Mm.

696
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,664
Yo, kiss me back.
Kiss me back.

697
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:26,844
- There she is!
The birthday girl!

698
00:27:26,846 --> 00:27:28,312
Give me your purse.
- Hi!

699
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,914
Um, Evie, I think I said
small and tasteful.

700
00:27:30,916 --> 00:27:34,284
- Kate, small and tasteful is
how you describe an Olsen twin,

701
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,286
not an awesome
b-day blowout bash.

702
00:27:36,288 --> 00:27:38,889
- Who are all these people?

703
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:39,890
- Oh, my god, Rufus.

704
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,191
The sign too?

705
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,894
- What is happening,
you crazy idiots?

706
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:46,964
Next song, "pumpkin goats"!

707
00:27:49,435 --> 00:27:51,935
- Okay, so I tried to get you
one of those naked girls

708
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:54,171
that's covered in sashimi,
but she canceled!

709
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,172
- Thank god.

710
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,307
- So I improvised!

711
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:01,078
- A crotch covered
in mini pizzas.

712
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,179
You shouldn't have, Evie.

713
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:03,947
- She really shouldn't have.

714
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:06,750
- Here we have Rufus wearing
the season's hottest snacks.

715
00:28:06,752 --> 00:28:08,252
Perfect for an Autumn wedding

716
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:10,220
or to stuff our faces with later
when we're drunk.

717
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:11,822
- Did you get in trouble
at the shop again?

718
00:28:11,824 --> 00:28:14,158
- It was worth it.
Happy birthday.

719
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,325
- Thank you!

720
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:16,360
- Oh, let me show you
the kitchen!

721
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,028
- Okay.
Bye.

722
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,229
Excuse me.

723
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,033
- Do you have any Rihanna?

724
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,468
- No!

725
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,470
- Beyoncé?

726
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:28,205
- No!

727
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:32,076
Baha men?

728
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:35,045
- Oh, "who let the dogs out"!

729
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,714
No!
No, no.

730
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:39,950
I hold them in the kennel
and then I play beats!

731
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:46,023
- And the kitchen!
- Oh, wow.

732
00:28:48,461 --> 00:28:50,094
What's going on here?
- Take that cake!

733
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:51,428
- It's funnel caking.

734
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:53,063
You funnel a beer
and then you eat cake.

735
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,298
Kate, you got to get out more.

736
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,332
- Apparently.
- Happy birthday, Kate!

737
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:58,502
- Oh, hey, Claire!

738
00:28:58,504 --> 00:29:00,204
- In honor of me finally
not being the only one

739
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:02,840
in the 30s club,
I'd like to propose a toast.

740
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:05,075
To Evie for organizing
one hell of a party.

741
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:06,777
- Thank you.
I did.

742
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:08,245
- And to Charlie
for having friends

743
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:09,980
that I don't have to pretend
to like.

744
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:11,181
- Yep.
- And to Kate.

745
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:12,349
- Well, thank you.
Cheers!

746
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:13,751
- Cheers!

747
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:14,952
- Down the hatch.

748
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,254
- Ah!

749
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,089
- Whoo!

750
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,258
- Okay, now let's go see who
can funnel a cake the fastest.

751
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,393
- After Kate goes first!

752
00:29:23,395 --> 00:29:24,495
- I'm terrified.
- Yes!

753
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:25,829
- Great!
- When aren't you?

754
00:29:25,831 --> 00:29:26,830
Let's go!
Peer pressure.

755
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:27,831
Peer pressure!

756
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:29,166
- Pace yourself, show off.

757
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:30,167
I know you're excited,
but I don't want

758
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:31,935
competitive Charlie coming out.

759
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,037
Whenever she shows up, it always
means a horrible night for me.

760
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,806
- I am pacing myself.

761
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,174
- Promise?
- Yeah.

762
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:38,408
Whoa!
You wore it?

763
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,410
- Oh, relax.
No one's gonna notice it.

764
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,079
I couldn't bring myself
to take it off.

765
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:43,147
This thing is amazing.

766
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:44,248
- I know.
It is amazing.

767
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,449
- Can we afford it?
- Hmm?

768
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,517
- What, financially?
No.

769
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,353
But we can afford to be happy.

770
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,288
No?

771
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,456
Okay.

772
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:53,824
Could you go check
on Rufus for me?

773
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:55,058
- Oh, sure.
He might be cold.

774
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,059
- Yeah.
- You chill with your friends.

775
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,060
- Okay.
- Okay?

776
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,061
Bye.

777
00:29:58,063 --> 00:29:59,496
- Oh.
Hide it!

778
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,100
- Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate!

779
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:05,135
Whoo!

780
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,203
Yeah!

781
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:07,471
- Oh.
- Oh, my god!

782
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:09,039
- That is terrible.

783
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:11,041
- Okay, you guys,
remember how we were reminiscing

784
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,309
about the glory days?

785
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,877
- Hold on.
When were our glory days?

786
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:15,245
- High school.

787
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:16,847
- Okay, if high school
were our glory days,

788
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,348
just take me out back
and do an old yeller.

789
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,150
- Very cute.

790
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,052
No, I thought it would be really
fun to invite some of the people

791
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:24,121
that we went to high school
with tonight.

792
00:30:24,123 --> 00:30:25,422
So I got a yes
from Leslie marks...

793
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:26,957
- Oh.

794
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:30,127
- And from Kelly Evans,
and I got a maybe from...

795
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:31,562
Are you ready for this?

796
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:34,264
Ben Jenkins.
- Ben Jenkins?

797
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:36,366
Why would you invite an ex
from high school?

798
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:37,935
- What?
We're all adults.

799
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:39,169
Get real.

800
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:40,504
Look, I just think
it's really fun

801
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,105
to see some of the people
from our past,

802
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,106
something I hope that you...

803
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,908
- What?
- Guess who.

804
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:47,611
- Um... someone who recently
ate ham?

805
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:49,146
- Ah!

806
00:30:49,148 --> 00:30:51,849
- Oh!
Jesus.

807
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:53,317
Peter Finch!

808
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,352
Look at you.

809
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,087
- Yeah, Evie found me
on Facebook.

810
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,589
Made sure I got an invite.

811
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:00,490
- Thanks, Evie.
- You're welcome.

812
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:03,360
- So, uh, what have you been
up to the past decade?

813
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:04,628
- All sorts of different stuff.

814
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:07,331
Watching football,
fantasy football,

815
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,466
been coaching some football
over in Jefferson county,

816
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:12,936
but I just moved back because...
Hold onto your panties...

817
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:15,539
I'm the new sports director
at Lincoln high!

818
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,644
Thank you for the warning.

819
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:22,579
My panties could've been all...

820
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:28,318
- Did she just skeet shoot
her panties?

821
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,319
- I did indeed.
- Straight up.

822
00:31:29,321 --> 00:31:31,355
You were always so smart.

823
00:31:31,357 --> 00:31:33,223
I'm sure you're doing all sorts
of cool things with your life.

824
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,393
- Um, you know,
lots of cool things.

825
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,394
Keeping really busy.

826
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:38,595
- Hey, I got a quick question

827
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:40,530
about that sports director
thing.

828
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:43,267
Um, who makes the uniforms
for Lincoln high?

829
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,602
Uhh...

830
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:48,372
I think that's
Eastside trophy & print.

831
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:49,539
- Got it.

832
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,675
- Straight up, Kate,
you look fine.

833
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:54,344
You haven't changed a bit
since high school.

834
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,612
- Thank you.

835
00:31:55,614 --> 00:31:57,047
Peter...

836
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:58,415
You look good too.

837
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,317
- Hell yeah.

838
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,052
- Okay, I'm gonna go clean up
the funnel cake mess, so...

839
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:03,587
- Yeah, go do that.

840
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,122
- So glad you're here!
It's so good to see you!

841
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:06,189
- Peace, girl.

842
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:07,190
- So, I'm...

843
00:32:07,192 --> 00:32:08,258
- straight up.
Evie?

844
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,927
You look fine.

845
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,996
You haven't changed a bit
since high school.

846
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,465
Did you go to Lincoln high?

847
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,034
- Yeah, I was a grade under you.

848
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,402
- I don't think so.

849
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:20,404
I'd remember
if you were ever under me.

850
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,207
- Okay.

851
00:32:24,209 --> 00:32:25,976
I'm gonna go get Kate
some new panties.

852
00:32:25,978 --> 00:32:27,611
- Yeah, sounds good.
- Peace, girl.

853
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,013
- Straight up.
- Panties.

854
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:31,015
- Hell yeah.

855
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,396
- Hey, buddy.

856
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,497
- Hi.

857
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:49,066
What you doing?

858
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:51,201
Sitting here all by yourself
being overly dramatic?

859
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:53,003
Just waiting for us
to come find you?

860
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,571
- Took you ten minutes.

861
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:56,006
New record, slowpokes.

862
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:57,007
- Yikes.

863
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,108
Sorry.

864
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,209
She mad.

865
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,577
- No!
I'm not mad.

866
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:02,245
I swear, I'm not mad.

867
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,715
Even though this is exactly
what I did not ask for.

868
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:06,216
- That is debatable.

869
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,318
- But really...
And I can't believe

870
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,420
I'm about to say this
to you guys...

871
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,189
I can't stop thinking about
that letter.

872
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:13,557
- Oh, my god.

873
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,993
- Not one thing
on that damn letter came true.

874
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:17,561
- Uh?
- Except for this party.

875
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:19,363
- Yes, thank you.

876
00:33:19,365 --> 00:33:21,732
And, okay, who cares about
that stupid letter?

877
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:23,533
I'm pretty sure that mine said

878
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,435
I was gonna marry
Justin Timberlake

879
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:27,371
and be Oscar nominated by now.

880
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:28,739
Do you see me practicing
my acceptance speech?

881
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:29,740
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

882
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:31,341
- Like, all the time.

883
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,043
Like, in the car.
When you're hanging out.

884
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:34,277
When you think you're alone
for even a second.

885
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,278
- Great.
Good.

886
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,014
It's a great speech.

887
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,348
- Okay, I'm bringing this
back to me for a sec.

888
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,683
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't know.

889
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,719
That letter was just, like,
"hey, Kate!

890
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:48,125
"Your job is super lame and your
fun is just organized clubs,

891
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:50,093
"and one day you're gonna
get happy hour

892
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,561
"with your two best friends

893
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,597
"and your two friends
are gonna order club soda

894
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,465
"and you're gonna realize
they're pregnant,

895
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,234
"and they're gonna have kids
and they're not gonna have time

896
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:59,069
"for taco Tuesday,
and you're just gonna be this,

897
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:02,339
"like, weird, sad, lonely,
cat-lady aunt

898
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:04,808
that sends them over-sexualized
birthday cards."

899
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,109
- Kate, that is ridiculous.

900
00:34:06,111 --> 00:34:07,644
- I know it is

901
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:08,645
'cause I hate cats.

902
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:10,414
Yeah.

903
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:12,349
And I'm not gonna compromise
this body with pregnancy.

904
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:14,718
- Okay, first of all,
can we stop saying the p word?

905
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,054
I'm pretty sure that
my mother-in-law's been slipping

906
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,555
prenatal vitamins
into my Pinot Grigio.

907
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,556
- That is scary.

908
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,690
- Mm-hmm.
I know.

909
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,059
But second of all,
you're just...

910
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:23,393
You're in a rut, Kate.

911
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,495
You have all of these
little routines

912
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:27,631
and these little schedules
and you just...

913
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:28,698
You never let loose.

914
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,167
Look at you.

915
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:31,334
You're dressed like
a substitute teacher

916
00:34:31,336 --> 00:34:32,669
for your 30th birthday party.

917
00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:34,104
- Okay, excuse me,
this is faux leather.

918
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:35,105
Pleather?

919
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:37,274
- And substitutes are fun!

920
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:38,475
- Okay.
- How dare you.

921
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:40,077
- But you need to let loose.
- Yeah.

922
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,344
- So tonight, let loose!

923
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:42,813
- Yeah, party time.
- Yeah.

924
00:34:42,815 --> 00:34:44,781
- "Partee tyme."
- "Partee tyme."

925
00:34:44,783 --> 00:34:46,616
- What is the deal
with these shirts?

926
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:47,818
I don't understand them at all.

927
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,586
- It... it's a Rufus thing.

928
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,721
- But it doesn't matter
because if anyone asks,

929
00:34:51,723 --> 00:34:53,790
it's our inside joke.

930
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:55,559
- Perfect.

931
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:57,794
- I kind of love that.
- Yes, you do!

932
00:34:57,796 --> 00:34:59,463
- Party time on three.

933
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:00,464
- One.
Both: Two, three!

934
00:35:00,466 --> 00:35:01,865
- This is so stupid.

935
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:03,867
All: Party time!

936
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:05,535
- Yeah, whoo!
- Here's yours.

937
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:07,237
- Oh, it's my color.
- Yeah.

938
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,805
You thought you were gonna
look cute tonight.

939
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,407
No way.
- Nope.

940
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:11,508
That's what friends are for.
- Mm-hmm.

941
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,790
- It'll look great with leather.

942
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:15,345
- Watch it.

943
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:16,446
Rebecca!
You made it!

944
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,447
- Hi!
- Hi!

945
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,782
Oh.
Oh, okay.

946
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,584
Kate, you remember Rebecca
from Lincoln?

947
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:23,887
- Yeah, I think we had art
together for a few semesters.

948
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:26,123
How you doing?
- Good.

949
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,324
- Okay.

950
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:29,326
- Ooh, man.
Poor thing.

951
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:31,661
You know, her entire Instagram
feed is just covered in photos

952
00:35:31,663 --> 00:35:33,864
of her five kids
in matching outfits.

953
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:35,732
You know, tonight might
actually be the first night

954
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,601
that she's been out of her house
since Lincoln.

955
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:41,138
- Well,
maybe she is super happy.

956
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,172
- Kate.

957
00:35:42,174 --> 00:35:43,773
Her newborn wears headbands.

958
00:35:43,775 --> 00:35:45,575
That woman is bored to death.

959
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:47,277
Oh, my god.
Tommy Hughes is here.

960
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:48,812
I am pretty sure
that I gave him an h.J.

961
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,280
On the opening night
of "pippin."

962
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:51,781
I should...

963
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:53,183
- god, you know, it always
shocked me how much ass

964
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:54,651
you theater kids got.

965
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,486
- Oh, yeah, I mean, second only
to youth church groups.

966
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,355
- Yeah, I'm gonna... I'll meet you
guys in there, okay?

967
00:35:58,357 --> 00:35:59,356
Hi!

968
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:00,657
- Hi!
- Hey!

969
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,526
Yes.
- Yeah, friends hug.

970
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:04,194
- Yeah, let's do it.

971
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:06,263
I am surprised to see you.

972
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:08,165
- Was that a throw-away invite?

973
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,800
- No, I'm saying I'm surprised
in a good way.

974
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:12,669
- Cool.
- Yeah.

975
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,337
- Why don't you have a drink
in your hand?

976
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,806
- Guilty.
- Ooh, problem.

977
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:19,676
Well, I'm gonna go get myself
and you a drink.

978
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:21,211
Beer or wine?

979
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:22,846
- A white Russian?
- No way.

980
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:23,914
- They're delicious!

981
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:26,183
- That's my favorite drink.

982
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:27,184
- Really?
- Yeah.

983
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:28,752
- Get out of here.

984
00:36:28,754 --> 00:36:31,221
- Well, i... i should let you go
do your birthday host thing,

985
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:33,490
so I will make you a drink
and then come find you.

986
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:34,658
- That is a perfect plan.

987
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,793
- Okay.
- Welcome to my party.

988
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,528
- Thank you
for making me feel welcome.

989
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,363
- You're welcome
for feeling welcome.

990
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,898
- Thank you.
- This could go all night.

991
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,767
- Bye-bye.

992
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:52,275
- Listen.
- Yes.

993
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:54,377
- If we get separated tonight...
- Uh-huh.

994
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:55,812
- Can... can you just keep it
that way?

995
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:58,682
- Now, look, we can stay out
as late as you want, okay?

996
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:00,517
As long as you do me one favor.

997
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:05,288
Don't embarrass me.

998
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,957
Hi.
I'm raven.

999
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:16,733
- There's somebody
under there, dude.

1000
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,934
- Don't mind me.

1001
00:37:19,705 --> 00:37:21,571
- Who did this to you?

1002
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:25,375
- Are you the victim
of a snack avalanche?

1003
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:26,376
- Uh, nope.

1004
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:27,811
This is just my job tonight.

1005
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:28,845
- Uh...

1006
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:31,514
So your job is to be a plate?

1007
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:32,916
- No.

1008
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,818
I am a plate.

1009
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,454
There was acid in that
baba ghanoush you just ate.

1010
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:39,923
This is a hallucination.

1011
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,661
Oooh.

1012
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,002
- Oh, boy!

1013
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:54,304
I hope your necks are made
of ice cream cones

1014
00:37:54,306 --> 00:37:57,807
because this next track is gonna
make your faces melt!

1015
00:38:03,048 --> 00:38:04,948
- I'm gonna have to see some ID,
young man.

1016
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,383
- I... i... i...

1017
00:38:06,385 --> 00:38:08,051
Just screwing with you.

1018
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:09,686
Can I have a sip?

1019
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:12,289
What is that, Glenfiddich
or Glenmorangie 25?

1020
00:38:14,293 --> 00:38:16,026
Apple juice.
You trying to kill me?

1021
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:19,996
- Excuse me.

1022
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,731
- How old are you?

1023
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,300
- Hi.

1024
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:24,301
- Hey!

1025
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:25,535
Thanks for inviting us.

1026
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:27,070
- Us?
- Yo!

1027
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,471
What's up, Timmy?

1028
00:38:30,409 --> 00:38:32,008
- Um, it's Oliver.
- Yeah, that's what I said.

1029
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,576
Dude, you know where I can get
a drink around here

1030
00:38:33,578 --> 00:38:34,644
for me and my boys?

1031
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,913
- Um, the bar, I guess.

1032
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:38,982
- Cool.
Kins, some Tequila?

1033
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,317
Eh?

1034
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:41,318
- I'm good.
Just water.

1035
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,419
- Lame.

1036
00:38:42,421 --> 00:38:43,520
Excuse me.
Coming through.

1037
00:38:43,522 --> 00:38:44,854
Beep, beep.
Watch your feet.

1038
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:54,597
All: 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 12, 13, 14!

1039
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:00,003
- 14 seconds.
That's not bad.

1040
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,604
It's not bad.
- Not bad?

1041
00:39:01,606 --> 00:39:02,839
Let's see what you got.

1042
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:05,775
- Ex-squeeze me.

1043
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:10,046
Oh, no, no, no.

1044
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:12,716
I don't do yoga four days a week
to need a lift.

1045
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,619
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

1046
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,121
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

1047
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:19,823
Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug!

1048
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,491
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

1049
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:40,009
- You have a very lovely spread,

1050
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,412
but do you have any Sauerkraut?

1051
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,449
Pretzels?

1052
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:49,986
Weiner schnitzel?

1053
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,422
- Yeah, you might want
to nix the wiener talk

1054
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:54,157
with my current state.

1055
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:56,659
- Fine.
Taquitos it is.

1056
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,829
- Who's Manning the booth?

1057
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,765
- The boo...
Oh,<i> Scheisse!</i>

1058
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:06,469
- It was nice catching up,
Rebecca!

1059
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:07,937
Wow!
- Wow!

1060
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:11,141
Didn't recognize me
in my weekend look, did you?

1061
00:40:11,143 --> 00:40:13,143
I just wanted to say hi.

1062
00:40:13,145 --> 00:40:15,879
I know that it's your birthday
and you probably don't want

1063
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:17,814
your rad new boyfriend
hanging on you all night.

1064
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:18,815
- Uh, Richard?

1065
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:19,849
- Raven.
- Raven.

1066
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:20,850
Raven.

1067
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,051
Really try and drop it down.

1068
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,420
It should be from your
diaphragm.

1069
00:40:23,422 --> 00:40:24,954
- Raven, you're not
my boyfriend.

1070
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:27,690
We went on one date, and I
army crawled away from you.

1071
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:29,559
- Yeah, yeah.
No, I know.

1072
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:31,194
And it's... your upper body
strength is one of the things

1073
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:32,829
I love most about you.

1074
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:35,064
- Okay.
Okay, great.

1075
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:37,500
- Anyway, boyfriend,
future boyfriend,

1076
00:40:37,502 --> 00:40:39,536
whatever you want to call it,
my dear.

1077
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:41,438
Raven will be around.

1078
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,772
Permission to touch
thy shoulders.

1079
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,441
- Not permissed.
- Raven understands.

1080
00:40:44,443 --> 00:40:45,742
Raven apologizes.

1081
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:46,776
I look to... oh.
Sorry.

1082
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,845
Sorry.
Raven is sorry.

1083
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:50,447
Raven is sorry about that
as well.

1084
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,048
Okay.

1085
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:54,818
That guy just spent 20 minutes
trying to sell me a VCR.

1086
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,219
- Did you buy it?

1087
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:57,654
- Well, I wasn't gonna,
but then he threw in

1088
00:40:57,656 --> 00:40:58,755
all ten season
of "friends," so...

1089
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,089
Nice.

1090
00:41:00,091 --> 00:41:01,090
Thank you.

1091
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:02,492
- Yeah.

1092
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,031
Ooh.

1093
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:09,199
Yeah, you...
- are you okay?

1094
00:41:09,201 --> 00:41:10,200
- Maybe take
these drinks outside?

1095
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:11,201
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1096
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:12,936
- Yeah.
- War zone.

1097
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:14,858
- I'll be out there in, like,
two... two minutes.

1098
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:17,841
Hey, Evie?

1099
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:20,844
This is gonna sound nuts,
but did you invite raven

1100
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:21,845
to this party?

1101
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:23,546
- Raven-symoné?

1102
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:25,114
Yeah, of course I did,
but she never tweeted back.

1103
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,883
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1104
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:28,518
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where did you get this?

1105
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,953
- Mantle.

1106
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:33,056
- This is a 1700s Norwegian ski
that a king

1107
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:34,557
did something for.

1108
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,493
You know what?
Let's just do this.

1109
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,797
- I've never met anyone else
who will make a white Russian

1110
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,532
at a party.

1111
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:44,667
- Oh, see, what I do is
I rationalize all the vodka

1112
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:47,036
I'm drinking because the milk
is good for my teeth.

1113
00:41:47,038 --> 00:41:48,505
- Ah.
- Yeah.

1114
00:41:48,507 --> 00:41:50,106
What's your excuse?

1115
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:52,675
I went through
a "big lebowski" phase.

1116
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,210
- Yikes.

1117
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:56,546
- Yeah, there's way too many
photos of me wearing a robe

1118
00:41:56,548 --> 00:41:59,716
in public from that time,
but I can bowl a 230,

1119
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:00,717
so there's that.

1120
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,253
- I am impressed.

1121
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:05,054
- I'm the one who's impressed.

1122
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:06,689
I mean, don't take
this the wrong way...

1123
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,926
- oh, that is such a good way
to start a sentence.

1124
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:12,762
- I guess I just didn't...
I didn't think that somebody

1125
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:15,131
who owns scrubs
with cartoon teeth

1126
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:18,301
wearing cowboy hats on them
would have such a Rager.

1127
00:42:18,303 --> 00:42:19,836
- So what do you do?

1128
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:22,972
Are you, like,
a lumberjack or something?

1129
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:24,607
- Was that a flannel joke?

1130
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:25,675
You know, flannels are in.

1131
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:27,043
- Apparently.

1132
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:29,846
- I wish I did something
as manly as lumberjacking.

1133
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:31,548
I'm in website design.

1134
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,082
- Oh, cool.

1135
00:42:33,084 --> 00:42:35,718
So you're a nerd.

1136
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,720
- Um...

1137
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:40,623
Uh, so how does one fall into...

1138
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:44,627
- the glamorous life
of an orthodontist assistant?

1139
00:42:44,629 --> 00:42:47,797
Well, first, you get made fun of
for your braces in high school.

1140
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,632
- Oh, I had to wear an eye patch
in kindergarten

1141
00:42:49,634 --> 00:42:51,067
to correct a lazy eye.

1142
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,635
In reality,
I looked like a pirate

1143
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:55,071
and everybody in my class
thought it was awesome.

1144
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,273
- Cool brag, I guess.

1145
00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:01,144
- Yeah, I don't know why
I shared that.

1146
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:04,013
I think I was trying to relate.

1147
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:07,150
- Um, no, so I actually went
to school, dental school,

1148
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:09,619
to be an orthodontist,
but I don't know.

1149
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:12,922
I just freaked out when they
wanted me to pull a tooth.

1150
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:14,591
It's really scary.

1151
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:15,725
Gave me the heebie-jeebies.

1152
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,226
- The heebie-jeebies?

1153
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:19,896
Ma'am, is this
your 90th birthday?

1154
00:43:19,898 --> 00:43:21,731
- Okay, how dare you.

1155
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:23,132
The heebie-jeebies is a thing.

1156
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:24,233
People say that I think.

1157
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:25,735
- No, I'm sorry.

1158
00:43:25,737 --> 00:43:26,836
I shouldn't make fun
of somebody who knows

1159
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:28,071
I wear an adult retainer.

1160
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:29,272
You have the power.

1161
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:31,007
- Cannot wait to abuse it.

1162
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:34,110
- Well, I cannot wait
to be abused.

1163
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:38,014
- Okay, what are we
even talking about?

1164
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:41,951
- Push up! Push up!
Push up!

1165
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,325
- What did we miss?

1166
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:51,961
- Competitive Charlie is back
and she's out of control.

1167
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,162
- Really?

1168
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:58,768
Claire, this is Dan.
Dan, Claire.

1169
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:05,108
- I am responsible
for all of that.

1170
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:07,410
- Whoo!

1171
00:44:07,412 --> 00:44:09,679
All right, all right.

1172
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:13,716
Round three will commence
in this room in 15 minutes.

1173
00:44:13,718 --> 00:44:15,118
- Okay.

1174
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,686
- What happened
to our pinky promise?

1175
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:18,721
- Oh, Claire bear,
everything is under control.

1176
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:20,323
- Hey, Charlie,
do you want me to leave the ice

1177
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:22,225
in the kiddie pool or unload it
for the sumo challenge?

1178
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:23,860
- Leave it in the kiddie pool.

1179
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,863
Just trust me.
- Take it easy.

1180
00:44:26,865 --> 00:44:28,297
I don't want to be a widow
before we even get married.

1181
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:30,099
- Oh, but you look so good
in black.

1182
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:31,300
- Yeah.

1183
00:44:36,908 --> 00:44:39,776
- Ready to go?

1184
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,129
- Can I play?

1185
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:03,900
- Yeah, yeah.
Totally, totally.

1186
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:05,101
- Yeah?

1187
00:45:08,106 --> 00:45:12,141
- Uh, where's Derrick?

1188
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:16,212
- Uh, having a pissing contest.

1189
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:18,181
- Is he still trying to
out push up that short lady?

1190
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:23,086
- No, he's literally outside
having a pissing contest

1191
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:24,220
with his friends.

1192
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,321
- Oh, wow.

1193
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:26,322
- Yeah.

1194
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:28,124
- Um, do you know how to play?

1195
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:29,959
- Yeah.
Um...

1196
00:45:29,961 --> 00:45:32,762
Uh...

1197
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:35,331
So the horse can, like,
gallop to the other side, right?

1198
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:36,733
Like boom.

1199
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:38,801
- Not... not traditionally.

1200
00:45:38,803 --> 00:45:41,070
I mean, we can... we can play by
different rules or something.

1201
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:46,409
There's other forms of chess,
I think, so...

1202
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:47,410
Just...

1203
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:48,745
- I was...
I...

1204
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:49,746
Totally kidding.

1205
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:51,447
Just kidding.

1206
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:54,317
- Oh.
Wow.

1207
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:55,818
- Check mate.

1208
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,291
- And now I have eight cats.

1209
00:46:02,293 --> 00:46:03,493
- Seriously?
- No!

1210
00:46:03,495 --> 00:46:05,294
- Kate!
Kate, you have to come see this.

1211
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:07,830
We started doing body shots,
and this one girl's belly button

1212
00:46:07,832 --> 00:46:09,532
can hold, like, eight ounces.

1213
00:46:09,534 --> 00:46:11,267
- That is gross.
- I know.

1214
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:14,137
- Uh, Evie, this is Dan.
Dan, Evie.

1215
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:15,371
She threw me the birthday party.

1216
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:16,973
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

1217
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:18,875
- This is just like
parties in high school.

1218
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:20,209
- Thank you.

1219
00:46:20,211 --> 00:46:22,278
- Or at least
how I imagined them to be

1220
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,247
as I sat at home
and played "Oregon trail."

1221
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:25,882
Yes.

1222
00:46:25,884 --> 00:46:28,117
Alerting children
of the dangers of dysentery.

1223
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,886
- I was more of a typhoid guy
myself.

1224
00:46:29,888 --> 00:46:30,887
- You know what?

1225
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:31,888
I can see that about you.

1226
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,056
- Whoa.
Major flirt alert.

1227
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:35,358
Don't want to get hurt.

1228
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,493
- Uh...
- Eject.

1229
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:39,362
- You know, I'm gonna go take
that body shot.

1230
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:43,065
Do you want to watch
this disaster?

1231
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:44,367
- I'm good.

1232
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:47,236
Body shots give me
the heebie-jeebies.

1233
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:48,237
- See what you did there.

1234
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,238
You're clever.

1235
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,907
- Well, it was for your benefit.

1236
00:46:57,182 --> 00:46:59,048
- Something got you down,
sad clown?

1237
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:00,850
- Look at that.

1238
00:47:00,852 --> 00:47:03,352
My girlfriend flirting with some
other guy right in front of me.

1239
00:47:03,354 --> 00:47:05,221
She bossed me then tossed me.

1240
00:47:05,223 --> 00:47:06,923
- Shocking.

1241
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:08,858
The guy in all black
is depressed about something.

1242
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,359
- Ha-ha.
That's hilarious.

1243
00:47:10,361 --> 00:47:12,929
- Lucky for you,
clichés are one of my things.

1244
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:14,964
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1245
00:47:14,966 --> 00:47:16,332
Kate! Kate! Kate! Kate!

1246
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,534
Kate! Kate! Kate!

1247
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:20,336
- And now I'm gonna go
brush my teeth.

1248
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:23,339
- Yeah!
- No offense.

1249
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,474
I'm sorry, were you wearing wool
earlier today?

1250
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:26,576
- Totally.
- Okay, me next!

1251
00:47:26,578 --> 00:47:27,977
Me next!

1252
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:35,585
- Ah, I'll take this one.

1253
00:47:35,587 --> 00:47:37,119
Well, well, well.

1254
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:38,554
If it isn't the one
that got away.

1255
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:42,291
The Sandra Dee to my Danny Zuko.

1256
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:43,960
- Well, I'll be damned.

1257
00:47:43,962 --> 00:47:45,161
Ben Jenkins.

1258
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:49,966
Mm!

1259
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,870
It's good.
- Okay.

1260
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:55,404
- Yeah.

1261
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:58,207
So look at you.
You haven't aged a bit.

1262
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:01,978
- Same for you,
except you are super ripped now.

1263
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,881
- I'm just trying
to make an ex jealous.

1264
00:48:04,883 --> 00:48:06,015
- An ex?
Oh.

1265
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:07,283
Bravo.

1266
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:08,517
- So where have you been hiding
these days?

1267
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,453
I don't know.

1268
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:14,190
I'm here and there and, um...

1269
00:48:17,128 --> 00:48:18,995
Just give me a second, Ben.

1270
00:48:18,997 --> 00:48:21,197
Don't leave.

1271
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:23,432
- You are like a girl.
You're so pretty.

1272
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:24,433
- Hi!

1273
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:25,434
How are you?
Great.

1274
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:26,669
You know what?

1275
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,204
I don't remember
inviting you, Ashley.

1276
00:48:28,206 --> 00:48:29,939
- Oh, that's funny.

1277
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:31,340
I don't remember the fountain
being full of puke

1278
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:33,442
when I sold this house
to frank and Nancy.

1279
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:35,111
You know what?

1280
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:36,312
Let me just text Nancy really
quick to see if...

1281
00:48:36,314 --> 00:48:37,380
- you know what?

1282
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:39,415
Please, come in.

1283
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,484
Make yourself at home.

1284
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:42,485
- Thank you.

1285
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:43,619
- Mm-hmm.

1286
00:48:44,989 --> 00:48:47,256
- Ooh, jell-o shots.
All right.

1287
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,358
You know, I am starving.

1288
00:48:50,662 --> 00:48:52,061
Mm.

1289
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:55,598
- It is.
- That is awesome.

1290
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,933
- How's it going?
- Excuse me.

1291
00:48:56,935 --> 00:48:58,034
- How you doing?

1292
00:48:58,036 --> 00:48:59,068
- Hey, girls!
- Hey, Kate!

1293
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:00,469
Hey, come here for one second.

1294
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:02,405
Just one quick second.
- Is everything okay?

1295
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:04,507
- I am calling
an official meeting.

1296
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:06,208
- Are we the baby-sitters club
now?

1297
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,510
- No.

1298
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:08,644
Oh, but if we were,
I would totally be

1299
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,046
Caucasian Claudia Kishi.

1300
00:49:10,048 --> 00:49:11,247
- You know, I see you
as more of a dawn.

1301
00:49:11,249 --> 00:49:12,248
- Okay, guys.
Hey, sorry.

1302
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,950
Can we move this on?

1303
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:15,151
I'm, like, really in the middle
of something.

1304
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:16,285
- Okay, um, Ashley's here.

1305
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,120
Both: Ashley Driscoll?

1306
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,523
- Yeah, and I asked her to
leave, but apparently she knows

1307
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:23,426
Todd's parents, and...
But then I thought about

1308
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:25,661
your letter and the p.S.

1309
00:49:25,663 --> 00:49:27,730
This is a perfect opportunity
to cross something off

1310
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:29,198
of that stupid letter.

1311
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,633
- Yeah, we could make her
eat shit.

1312
00:49:30,635 --> 00:49:31,968
- Actually,
I'm not really thinking about

1313
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,236
the letter anymore, guys.

1314
00:49:34,238 --> 00:49:36,238
- What do you mean you're not
really thinking about

1315
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,974
the letter anymore?

1316
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:39,375
Like, two hours ago
you were gonna have that letter

1317
00:49:39,377 --> 00:49:41,110
tattooed on your thigh.

1318
00:49:41,112 --> 00:49:43,646
Ooh, by the way, if anyone wants
to get tattoos tonight,

1319
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:45,281
I am so game!

1320
00:49:45,283 --> 00:49:47,650
- No. You know that guy Dan
I was talking to?

1321
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,518
- Yeah, the guy in the flannel?

1322
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,120
- I think I like him.

1323
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:52,488
He's cute, right?

1324
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,689
- Yeah.

1325
00:49:53,691 --> 00:49:57,360
- I would let him wear me
like a bonnet.

1326
00:49:57,362 --> 00:49:59,195
- I like a boy.

1327
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:01,497
And the best part is I think
he likes me too.

1328
00:50:01,499 --> 00:50:02,665
- That's even better, really.

1329
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:04,133
- I'm having fun tonight.

1330
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:05,701
- You should be!

1331
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:07,503
- Can you guys guess
what I'm doing?

1332
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:08,637
- I have no idea.

1333
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:09,739
- I'm Kate

1334
00:50:09,741 --> 00:50:12,141
climbing out of her rut.

1335
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:13,476
- Yeah, but see,
that's also how you dance.

1336
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:14,710
That's why it's confusing.

1337
00:50:14,712 --> 00:50:16,612
- Oh, we should do shots
to celebrate.

1338
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:19,248
- I will rain check because
I'm gonna pace myself tonight.

1339
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,250
Gonna see how things go
with Dan.

1340
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:29,425
- Hey, uh, do you guys know
the birthday girl, Kate?

1341
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:30,760
- Of course.

1342
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:32,695
What, do you think we were,
like, just riding by

1343
00:50:32,697 --> 00:50:34,697
on our razor scooters
and were like,

1344
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:36,599
"hey, there's a party,
let's go in there"?

1345
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:39,268
- Yeah, and then we accidentally
ate some Mediterranean

1346
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,804
eggplant dip that had acid in it
so now we feel trapped here?

1347
00:50:41,806 --> 00:50:43,339
- Okay.

1348
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:45,641
Well,
when she comes back down here,

1349
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:49,245
can you let her know that
Dan ran out to grab more milk?

1350
00:50:49,247 --> 00:50:50,679
I'll be back in, like,
ten minutes.

1351
00:50:52,784 --> 00:50:54,750
- Sure, man.
No problem.

1352
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,322
- Was that a human
we were talking to?

1353
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,126
- Girl, you look fine.

1354
00:51:04,128 --> 00:51:05,761
You haven't changed a bit
since high school.

1355
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:08,130
- I'd rather die.

1356
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,613
Are there any more jell-o sho...

1357
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:15,237
Who put a banister here?

1358
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:18,707
This should be an open-floor
concept, you Jack holes!

1359
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:23,079
- You... you aren't thinking
of driving, are you?

1360
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:24,647
- I live six blocks away.

1361
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:25,781
- Okay, that's a relief.

1362
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:27,083
- Of course I'm driving.

1363
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:29,185
Stupid.

1364
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:31,454
- Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1365
00:51:31,456 --> 00:51:33,422
Is that a magic 8 ball keychain?

1366
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:34,690
- Yes.

1367
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:37,626
It tells me
when I should have sex.

1368
00:51:37,628 --> 00:51:39,462
Do you want to have sex?

1369
00:51:39,464 --> 00:51:40,463
- How about this:

1370
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:41,664
I drive your car home for you

1371
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:43,532
and then I just walk back here.

1372
00:51:43,534 --> 00:51:45,701
I've had one drink and there's
no way I can let you drive.

1373
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:48,137
- Fine, but on one condition:

1374
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:50,306
You got to take me
to the quick pick

1375
00:51:50,308 --> 00:51:53,509
and get me some nachos.

1376
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:55,644
- I was going there anyway.

1377
00:51:55,646 --> 00:51:57,580
- Good.
I don't have any money.

1378
00:51:57,582 --> 00:51:59,448
I want 32 jalapenos.

1379
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,150
I want an ounce of nacho cheese.

1380
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:02,184
No more.

1381
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,446
- You know what?
I will take that shot.

1382
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:06,242
- Do you mind if we sped this up
a little bit?

1383
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:08,611
I kind of want to get back
to the party.

1384
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:11,313
- Well, now you've gone
and distracted me.

1385
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:14,383
I added too many jalapenos.

1386
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:15,584
Got to start over.

1387
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:21,624
- Ladies!
Ladies and gentlemen!

1388
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:24,393
Men and gentle ladies!

1389
00:54:24,395 --> 00:54:27,329
In our tie-breaking round,

1390
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:30,366
we will test a match
of endurance.

1391
00:54:30,368 --> 00:54:34,270
Peter and I will be lifting
these empty kegs

1392
00:54:34,272 --> 00:54:35,738
above our heads

1393
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,273
for as long as we can.

1394
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:38,275
- Yeah!

1395
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,543
- First person to break loses.

1396
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:43,379
Peter!

1397
00:54:43,381 --> 00:54:45,047
Are you ready?

1398
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:46,548
- You're going down.

1399
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,988
- Three, two, one!

1400
00:55:03,333 --> 00:55:04,933
- Oh, it's super easy for me.

1401
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:22,985
Oh, yes!

1402
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,019
Eat it, mouse girl.

1403
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:25,688
I am the greatest!

1404
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:29,024
You guys, you guys.
You heard it here first, folks.

1405
00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:30,893
Peter won.

1406
00:55:30,895 --> 00:55:33,662
He's, like,
way stronger than me.

1407
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:34,963
- What?
No!

1408
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:36,765
- Yeah.
Who knew?

1409
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,535
- I'm gonna head home.

1410
00:55:39,537 --> 00:55:41,103
Can you let Charlie know
that she should go ahead

1411
00:55:41,105 --> 00:55:42,104
and crash here tonight?

1412
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:43,372
- No problem.

1413
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:46,575
Can you scratch my right cheek?

1414
00:55:46,577 --> 00:55:47,577
- Okay.

1415
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:03,659
- I need to talk to you.

1416
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:05,094
- Holy shit.

1417
00:56:05,096 --> 00:56:06,795
- I met someone.

1418
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:08,464
- That's amazing.

1419
00:56:08,466 --> 00:56:11,433
- Yeah, well, but you guys...
You actually have a history

1420
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:12,735
with him.

1421
00:56:12,737 --> 00:56:14,103
Oh, god.

1422
00:56:14,105 --> 00:56:16,004
Okay, it all started because
raven was really upset

1423
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:17,539
about your breakup, and...

1424
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:18,907
- Raven and I didn't break...
- Yeah.

1425
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:19,942
- Okay.

1426
00:56:19,944 --> 00:56:21,410
- And... but he's gonna be okay.

1427
00:56:21,412 --> 00:56:24,513
He just... he needs to lick
his wounds,

1428
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:26,815
and I really need
to lick his face.

1429
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:29,618
- Jules,

1430
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,619
I'm happy for you.

1431
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:31,787
- Really?
- Yeah.

1432
00:56:31,789 --> 00:56:32,955
- Are you sure?
'Cause i...

1433
00:56:32,957 --> 00:56:35,157
- go forth and cage that bird.

1434
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:36,992
- I mean, 'cause,
like, girl COD...

1435
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:39,428
Like, I'm gonna cage it hard, so
I just want to make sure that,

1436
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:40,529
like, it's cool.

1437
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:41,663
Like, probably hard.

1438
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:43,098
Not, like, prison hard,
but, like...

1439
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,700
- I really don't need details
about it though.

1440
00:56:44,702 --> 00:56:45,701
- Okay.
- Please leave.

1441
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:47,002
- Thank you.
Okay, thank you.

1442
00:56:47,004 --> 00:56:48,737
Oh my... oh, yes.

1443
00:57:10,161 --> 00:57:11,994
- Guess what this is.

1444
00:57:11,996 --> 00:57:13,929
- Stop it.

1445
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,765
- Little Evie dogs, junior year,
singing an original love song

1446
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,467
to yours truly.

1447
00:57:21,038 --> 00:57:23,672
You don't happen to have
a dusty compact disc player

1448
00:57:23,674 --> 00:57:24,674
around here, do you?

1449
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,212
- In my car.

1450
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:33,215
- Let's go.

1451
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:35,851
- Okay.

1452
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:44,693
- This is normal.

1453
00:57:44,695 --> 00:57:45,894
I would do this sober.

1454
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:50,165
Not weird.

1455
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:53,202
Just a grown woman
in a China cabinet

1456
00:57:53,204 --> 00:57:54,603
calling a dude.

1457
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:03,011
Okay.

1458
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:04,980
One more.

1459
00:58:04,982 --> 00:58:06,114
If he answers, cool.

1460
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:07,950
If he doesn't, screw him.

1461
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:14,156
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi!

1462
00:58:14,158 --> 00:58:17,125
Luke!
It is Kate.

1463
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:21,096
- Kate, is everything okay?

1464
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:22,264
It's, like, one in the morning.

1465
00:58:22,266 --> 00:58:24,166
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

1466
00:58:24,168 --> 00:58:26,535
I'm actually better than okay

1467
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:29,738
because I just turned 30.

1468
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:32,708
It's my 30th birthday.

1469
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,243
Or it was till, like,
an hour ago.

1470
00:58:34,245 --> 00:58:36,278
<i>- Hey, happy birthday.</i>

1471
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,180
<i>Sorry, it's just...
It's late here.</i>

1472
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:40,682
- Oh, did I wake up...
Did I wake up the baby?

1473
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:41,984
<i>You have a baby!</i>

1474
00:58:41,986 --> 00:58:42,985
<i>Wow!</i>

1475
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:44,152
- I have a baby.

1476
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:47,089
- That is a weird sentence
to say.

1477
00:58:47,091 --> 00:58:51,627
Is it, like, crawling yet
or teething?

1478
00:58:51,629 --> 00:58:53,762
They cry, like, so much, I hear.

1479
00:58:53,764 --> 00:58:54,997
- Hey, what's up?
Are you okay?

1480
00:58:54,999 --> 00:58:55,998
It's...

1481
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,132
<i>- oh, you know what?</i>

1482
00:58:57,134 --> 00:58:58,634
I'm sorry, I just wanted...

1483
00:58:58,636 --> 00:58:59,635
I wanted to ask you
one question.

1484
00:58:59,637 --> 00:59:00,969
<i>- Yeah, okay.</i>

1485
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:02,271
- Just, like,
one super-quick question.

1486
00:59:02,273 --> 00:59:03,639
Is that okay?

1487
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:04,873
- Ah, okay.
Yeah, what's up?

1488
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,808
- My question is...

1489
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,076
Why wasn't it me?

1490
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,712
- What?

1491
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:14,783
- Like, all right,
we dated for four years,

1492
00:59:14,785 --> 00:59:18,020
and then we break up,
and it's, like, boom.

1493
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:20,856
Now you're married with a kid,
and I'm just wondering,

1494
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:24,560
you know,
why I wasn't that person.

1495
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,729
- Uh, well,
if you remember, Kate,

1496
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,665
you broke up with me.

1497
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:32,067
- Yeah, no, I know.
I know.

1498
00:59:32,069 --> 00:59:33,735
I was just wondering...

1499
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:35,604
<i>- and I don't know
if things have changed</i>

1500
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:37,906
<i>in the last couple years,
but when we were together,</i>

1501
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:40,275
<i>you weren't exactly
into marriage so much.</i>

1502
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:43,011
That was...
- why do you say that?

1503
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:45,047
- Okay, well,
the night at the restaurant

1504
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:47,916
when I was gonna propose to you,
you ran out like crazy

1505
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,586
when I was reaching
for my wallet.

1506
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:52,087
- I know.

1507
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:53,655
I thought... i thought you were
reaching for a ring.

1508
00:59:53,657 --> 00:59:55,824
<i>- I know you did.</i>

1509
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:57,626
<i>And that's why I didn't...
That's why I never asked you.</i>

1510
00:59:57,628 --> 01:00:01,129
Well, that and because you broke
up with me, like, a week later.

1511
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:02,965
- Yeah, I know.
I mean, I know that.

1512
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:04,700
I just, uh...

1513
01:00:04,702 --> 01:00:05,934
I didn't know
that you knew that.

1514
01:00:05,936 --> 01:00:07,369
<i>- But it's fine, right?</i>

1515
01:00:07,371 --> 01:00:09,671
Everything worked out
like it was supposed to.

1516
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,675
<i>I know we haven't...
We haven't talked in a while.</i>

1517
01:00:13,677 --> 01:00:14,843
<i>You okay?</i>

1518
01:00:14,845 --> 01:00:16,345
- Yeah, of course.

1519
01:00:16,347 --> 01:00:17,746
Of course.

1520
01:00:17,748 --> 01:00:20,082
And, um, hey,

1521
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:22,951
I want you to know
that I'm really happy for you.

1522
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,252
I just... i need you to know that.

1523
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:26,188
I really,
really am happy for you.

1524
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:27,189
<i>- Thanks, Kate.</i>

1525
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:28,624
<i>Stay out of trouble.</i>

1526
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:38,266
- Was that my voicemail?

1527
01:00:38,268 --> 01:00:39,668
- Oh, my god.
- I figured.

1528
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:40,869
There's something
I got to tell you,

1529
01:00:40,871 --> 01:00:42,738
which is...
Oh, geez.

1530
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,806
She's taking this really hard.

1531
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:46,241
She must be craving the raven.

1532
01:00:46,243 --> 01:00:48,043
- Oh, my god.

1533
01:00:48,045 --> 01:00:53,015
Did I just say that my love
is deeper than the ocean...

1534
01:00:53,017 --> 01:00:55,417
- Smoother than lotion.

1535
01:00:55,419 --> 01:00:57,019
It's a beautiful line.

1536
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:00,322
Evie, I can't tell you
how excited I was

1537
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:03,125
when I saw that invitation
in my Inbox.

1538
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:04,960
- Yeah, it's really nice
to see everyone.

1539
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:09,164
- Sort of validated the whole
divorce, all the drama.

1540
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,166
- Excuse me?
What?

1541
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:12,934
- Oh, Evie,

1542
01:01:12,936 --> 01:01:15,404
I've always known that we're
supposed to be together.

1543
01:01:15,406 --> 01:01:20,075
Even when I was married.

1544
01:01:20,077 --> 01:01:22,411
We're soul mates.

1545
01:01:22,413 --> 01:01:25,747
You're the Sandy to my Danny.

1546
01:01:25,749 --> 01:01:28,116
- That was a high school play.

1547
01:01:28,118 --> 01:01:30,719
- I just can't believe
it's happening now, you know?

1548
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:33,021
Ah, she was so pissed
when I got the tattoo.

1549
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,256
- Tattoo?

1550
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:35,323
- Oh.

1551
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,860
- Oh!
Wow!

1552
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,195
That's me!
- Yeah.

1553
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:41,296
That's your first headshot.

1554
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:42,831
- That's my first headshot.

1555
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:43,999
- First headshot, yeah.

1556
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:46,435
- Yeah, it is.

1557
01:01:46,437 --> 01:01:49,771
- It's like you're resting
your head on my chest.

1558
01:01:54,078 --> 01:01:56,344
- Okay.

1559
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:58,447
It's there.
You know what?

1560
01:01:58,449 --> 01:02:01,483
Um, Ben, I'm actually gonna
go check on the party,

1561
01:02:01,485 --> 01:02:04,419
which is just about over,
so you should probably go.

1562
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:06,354
- Evie, we're meant to be.

1563
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:11,493
Or...

1564
01:02:11,495 --> 01:02:12,794
Not to be.

1565
01:02:12,796 --> 01:02:14,162
- Uh-oh.

1566
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:15,397
- That is the question.

1567
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:17,099
- Oh, no.

1568
01:02:17,101 --> 01:02:19,768
- "Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer the slings

1569
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:22,404
"and arrows
of outrageous fortune

1570
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:24,473
"or to take arms against a sea
of troubles,

1571
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:26,041
and by opposing end them."

1572
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:27,409
- Okay, I'm gonna go, Ben.
Drive safe.

1573
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:29,244
- "To sleep.

1574
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:30,312
To"...

1575
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,751
"to sleep.

1576
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:36,985
"Ay, there's the rub!

1577
01:02:36,987 --> 01:02:38,887
For in that sleep of death,
what dream"...

1578
01:02:40,524 --> 01:02:41,523
- wow.

1579
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:43,992
So, hey, how you holding up?

1580
01:02:43,994 --> 01:02:46,895
- "Partee tyme."

1581
01:02:46,897 --> 01:02:48,130
- Thanks for doing this, dude.

1582
01:02:48,132 --> 01:02:50,232
I mean, like,
this is really awesome.

1583
01:02:50,234 --> 01:02:52,501
- Yeah.
Not always a total screw-up.

1584
01:02:52,503 --> 01:02:55,337
- Wow, you, like, really sucked
down there, didn't you?

1585
01:02:56,874 --> 01:02:58,440
- Excuse me, I'm a grown woman.

1586
01:02:58,442 --> 01:03:00,375
I'm not here to take insults
from, like,

1587
01:03:00,377 --> 01:03:01,877
a 17-year-old high schooler.

1588
01:03:01,879 --> 01:03:03,879
- Okay, first of all, I'm 191/2,

1589
01:03:03,881 --> 01:03:05,814
and second of all, good for you.

1590
01:03:05,816 --> 01:03:08,216
I thought you were, like, some
loser freshman I didn't know.

1591
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:09,785
Anyways, have you seen that
brunette hot girl

1592
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:10,786
you were hanging out with?

1593
01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:12,020
She was... she was super hot.

1594
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:14,389
- I think you mean
my girlfriend?

1595
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:16,925
- Wait, that's your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

1596
01:03:16,927 --> 01:03:18,527
- Oh, wow, because if I had
one hour with her...

1597
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:20,295
No, no, not even.

1598
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,197
If I had just, like, ten minutes
with her, I'd be like,

1599
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:23,865
"ooh, girl, you so naughty."

1600
01:03:23,867 --> 01:03:25,333
And I'd be like,
"ooh, what's up,<i> Mamí?"</i>

1601
01:03:25,335 --> 01:03:26,501
And then I'd be like,
"mm,<i> Mamí,</i> mm.

1602
01:03:26,503 --> 01:03:27,663
Give it to me.
Give it to me."

1603
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,306
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1604
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:32,468
I thought you were a Falafel.

1605
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:35,811
- What is going on?

1606
01:03:35,813 --> 01:03:37,112
- Oh, you're so dead, dude.

1607
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:39,881
Oh, my god.

1608
01:03:39,883 --> 01:03:41,016
I just hit a kid.

1609
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:43,985
- He's 191/2, remember?

1610
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:45,887
- I just knocked out a teenager.

1611
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:47,022
- Okay, that's it!
That's it!

1612
01:03:47,024 --> 01:03:48,456
Cut the music!
Cut the music!

1613
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,992
I need all of the children
to leave this party!

1614
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:52,294
Do you hear me?

1615
01:03:52,296 --> 01:03:53,829
If you're in high school
and/or too young

1616
01:03:53,831 --> 01:03:56,364
to know who vanilla ice is,
you have 30 seconds

1617
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:58,133
to get out of this party!

1618
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:04,940
My carpet!

1619
01:04:04,942 --> 01:04:06,474
Who did this?

1620
01:04:06,476 --> 01:04:08,310
- This has Ashley Driscoll's
name written all over it.

1621
01:04:08,312 --> 01:04:09,845
- I don't think we can just
assume that Ashley did it.

1622
01:04:09,847 --> 01:04:11,346
- No, literally.

1623
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:13,849
It says so right here
on the coozy.

1624
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:15,350
- You know what?

1625
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:18,420
Ashley Driscoll can eat shit.

1626
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,479
- Homeless or hipster?

1627
01:04:44,481 --> 01:04:46,014
- What?

1628
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:49,451
- I said homeless or hipster?

1629
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:51,953
- Oh.

1630
01:04:51,955 --> 01:04:53,588
Yeah, totally hipster.

1631
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:55,991
You know, I think he's in that
band the guidance counselors.

1632
01:04:55,993 --> 01:04:57,192
- Mm.

1633
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:03,498
Thank you.

1634
01:05:20,484 --> 01:05:23,585
- You know, you guys, I'm so
glad we splurged on two-ply.

1635
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:25,620
- I am having the best time

1636
01:05:25,622 --> 01:05:27,622
while simultaneously
feeling pretty bad

1637
01:05:27,624 --> 01:05:29,024
about being so wasteful.

1638
01:05:29,026 --> 01:05:30,292
- This is so cathartic.

1639
01:05:30,294 --> 01:05:31,293
- Yeah.

1640
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:32,527
We're queens of the night!

1641
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:34,362
- Screw you, Ashley Driscoll!

1642
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:36,331
- I hate my husband!

1643
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:40,201
- Whoa, dude.

1644
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:41,569
- That's a little dramatic,
Evie,

1645
01:05:41,571 --> 01:05:42,704
even for you.

1646
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,174
- It's true.

1647
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:48,243
I hate him.

1648
01:05:48,245 --> 01:05:50,045
I hate his clothes.

1649
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:52,280
I hate his narcissism.

1650
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:53,448
I hate his family.

1651
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:54,649
Oh, my god!

1652
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:57,352
His family.

1653
01:05:57,354 --> 01:06:00,422
I don't want to go
cross-country skiing.

1654
01:06:00,424 --> 01:06:04,459
What I do want is a divorce.

1655
01:06:06,228 --> 01:06:07,295
- Really?

1656
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:10,231
- Yeah.

1657
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:11,967
Yes!

1658
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:15,470
- Well, thank god
'cause we think he sucks.

1659
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,305
- Yeah, it's, like,
the only thing we talk about

1660
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,306
behind your back.

1661
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:19,407
- Really?

1662
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:20,542
- Yeah!
- He's the worst!

1663
01:06:20,544 --> 01:06:22,277
- Oh, my god!
- Oh, my god.

1664
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:23,611
- Wait, you guys.

1665
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:25,480
As long as we're
putting it out there,

1666
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:27,716
I got something I need
to say too.

1667
01:06:27,718 --> 01:06:28,984
- Okay.

1668
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:33,254
- I'm gay.

1669
01:06:35,525 --> 01:06:36,524
- I hate you.
- You're the worst.

1670
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:37,759
- I hate you.

1671
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:39,201
- What?
You guys just always guessed.

1672
01:06:40,097 --> 01:06:42,397
- Come in.

1673
01:06:42,399 --> 01:06:44,399
- It's kind of hard making it
up those stairs

1674
01:06:44,401 --> 01:06:47,102
with my eyes closed, obviously.

1675
01:06:47,104 --> 01:06:48,303
Can I open them?

1676
01:06:48,305 --> 01:06:50,505
- Open them, sad clown.

1677
01:06:56,446 --> 01:06:58,279
Holy crap.

1678
01:06:58,281 --> 01:07:00,048
- I want to bathe you.

1679
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:03,752
- You're the strangest woman
I've ever met.

1680
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:07,689
I think I love you.

1681
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:08,790
Is that okay?

1682
01:07:09,793 --> 01:07:11,659
- Holy crap!

1683
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:13,728
Okay, let me just...
God dang it.

1684
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:17,732
The thing is with... these boots
are very difficult to take off.

1685
01:07:17,734 --> 01:07:19,501
Goth lifestyle is worth it
for the fashion,

1686
01:07:19,503 --> 01:07:21,202
but it's definitely
time consuming.

1687
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,570
Crap!

1688
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:23,671
Come on!

1689
01:07:23,673 --> 01:07:24,672
Come on!

1690
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:25,740
Get off!

1691
01:07:25,742 --> 01:07:27,509
God, it's like a snow boot.

1692
01:07:27,511 --> 01:07:29,277
Jesus Christ!

1693
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:30,678
God damn it!

1694
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,680
It's just, like,
the force doesn't work

1695
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:34,315
'cause then it chokes me.

1696
01:07:34,317 --> 01:07:35,417
I'll leave it on.

1697
01:07:35,419 --> 01:07:36,518
I'll leave it on.

1698
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,686
Stay right there,
you sweet ViXen.

1699
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:40,622
- Just drop it off.

1700
01:07:40,624 --> 01:07:42,257
- God damn it.
I'm sorry.

1701
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,193
Get it off!
Come on!

1702
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:46,428
Jesus!

1703
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:47,829
Oh, god.

1704
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:48,830
- Hurry up.
- Oh, yeah!

1705
01:07:48,832 --> 01:07:50,432
Oh, oh, wait a minute.

1706
01:07:50,434 --> 01:07:52,434
Didn't take in the choker
into account.

1707
01:07:52,436 --> 01:07:54,536
Denise is not gonna be pleased
if this gets scratched.

1708
01:07:54,538 --> 01:07:56,071
- Who's Denise?

1709
01:07:56,073 --> 01:07:58,840
- Denise works at hot topic
in the mall.

1710
01:07:58,842 --> 01:08:01,409
Right next to the, uh...
Do you know Denise?

1711
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:02,744
- Hey, Kate!

1712
01:08:02,746 --> 01:08:05,447
Are you ready for your birthday
baby dance?

1713
01:08:08,485 --> 01:08:10,118
- Please do not do that.

1714
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,653
I'm gonna pee my pants.
I have to pee so bad.

1715
01:08:11,655 --> 01:08:12,687
- Just do it!

1716
01:08:12,689 --> 01:08:14,389
- What, just pee in the yard?

1717
01:08:14,391 --> 01:08:15,857
- Yeah, dude!
Why not?

1718
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,226
- Okay.
Yeah.

1719
01:08:18,228 --> 01:08:19,828
I'm gonna... I'm just gonna go.

1720
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:26,334
- Is, uh, your house
the white one with the columns?

1721
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:27,669
- Mm-hmm.

1722
01:08:27,671 --> 01:08:30,171
- With the round hedges
and the maple trees?

1723
01:08:30,173 --> 01:08:31,439
- Mm-hmm.

1724
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:33,341
- That are currently covered
in toilet paper?

1725
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:34,409
- Mm-hmm.

1726
01:08:34,411 --> 01:08:35,410
What the what?

1727
01:08:35,412 --> 01:08:36,678
- I'm doing it!

1728
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:37,679
- Wow!

1729
01:08:37,681 --> 01:08:39,380
- I'm peeing.

1730
01:08:39,382 --> 01:08:40,782
And I am really hydrated.

1731
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:42,183
Good for me.

1732
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:47,889
Hi.

1733
01:08:48,892 --> 01:08:50,492
- Hey!

1734
01:08:50,494 --> 01:08:54,696
You little bitches get
yoursel... oh, my god.

1735
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:57,432
It's turtle head and theaturd.

1736
01:08:57,434 --> 01:08:59,767
- Okay, you can't talk to them
like that, Ashley.

1737
01:08:59,769 --> 01:09:02,370
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Who's gonna stop me?

1738
01:09:02,372 --> 01:09:03,738
- Me.

1739
01:09:06,443 --> 01:09:07,809
Kate.

1740
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:11,579
Braceface.

1741
01:09:14,184 --> 01:09:16,217
Braceface?

1742
01:09:16,219 --> 01:09:18,286
So what is up, ladies?

1743
01:09:18,288 --> 01:09:22,323
Oh, is this some sad little
revenge plan that I ruined?

1744
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:23,791
Oh, you must feel like such a...

1745
01:09:24,794 --> 01:09:25,894
- oh, no!

1746
01:09:25,896 --> 01:09:28,263
- Oh, my god.
She just ate shit.

1747
01:09:28,265 --> 01:09:29,531
- Is she dead?

1748
01:09:29,533 --> 01:09:31,699
- We got to hide the body.

1749
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,236
- Good-bye, bench girl.

1750
01:09:43,914 --> 01:09:45,346
Oh, god!

1751
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:47,182
- Oh, that is bad!

1752
01:09:47,184 --> 01:09:48,183
That is really bad.

1753
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:49,184
- Is it bad?

1754
01:09:49,186 --> 01:09:50,785
- Oh, mm.
Yep.

1755
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:53,188
Your left lateral
incisor's completely cracked.

1756
01:09:53,190 --> 01:09:54,355
- Is that bad?

1757
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:55,857
- Well, it's irreparable damage,

1758
01:09:55,859 --> 01:09:57,625
which means immediate
tooth extraction.

1759
01:09:57,627 --> 01:09:59,561
- Ew, what does that mean?

1760
01:09:59,563 --> 01:10:01,396
- It means this sucker's coming
out right now.

1761
01:10:01,398 --> 01:10:02,764
What?

1762
01:10:02,766 --> 01:10:05,466
- She said that she needs
to pull your tooth out!

1763
01:10:05,468 --> 01:10:07,669
Do you understand?

1764
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:08,670
- Yes, theaturd!

1765
01:10:08,672 --> 01:10:10,238
I'm not having a stroke!

1766
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,706
- Okay, we'll talk about
the nickname later.

1767
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,908
- Okay, um, I need
some gauze or, like,

1768
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:16,377
grab some toilet paper,
and I need some pliers.

1769
01:10:16,379 --> 01:10:17,879
- Oh, there might be a toolkit
in the trunk.

1770
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:19,380
- You know what?

1771
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:22,417
You're a toolkit in the trunk,
Dan.

1772
01:10:22,419 --> 01:10:23,651
- What?
- Actually, yes, please.

1773
01:10:23,653 --> 01:10:24,852
Can you go look?
That'd be great.

1774
01:10:24,854 --> 01:10:25,987
Thank you.
- Okay.

1775
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:27,689
- Hurry!
And I need the vodka.

1776
01:10:27,691 --> 01:10:29,290
- Why?
- 'Cause I need the vodka.

1777
01:10:29,292 --> 01:10:30,458
- Okay.
- Please!

1778
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,459
- Here.
- Thank you.

1779
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:32,660
Oh.
- Oh, my god.

1780
01:10:32,662 --> 01:10:33,661
- Yeah.
- Oh!

1781
01:10:33,663 --> 01:10:34,929
Awesome!
Yes!

1782
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:36,364
Yes!

1783
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:38,299
- Oh, my god, my teeth...
So much.

1784
01:10:38,301 --> 01:10:39,300
- All right.

1785
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:40,635
Let's do this.

1786
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:42,503
- Wait!
Do you know what you're doing?

1787
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:43,638
- I sure hope so.

1788
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:51,479
I did it!

1789
01:10:51,481 --> 01:10:53,248
- I did it!

1790
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,382
I did it!

1791
01:10:54,384 --> 01:10:55,583
Whoa!

1792
01:10:58,388 --> 01:10:59,887
I didn't do it.
- Freeze!

1793
01:10:59,889 --> 01:11:03,458
Step away from the Asian girl!

1794
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:06,361
Dispatch, I think we have
a hate crime in progress.

1795
01:11:06,363 --> 01:11:07,695
My sister, are you okay?

1796
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:19,941
- Thanks so much for the ride.

1797
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:21,442
- No problem.

1798
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:24,479
Thanks so much for
kicking my ass in chess.

1799
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:25,613
You're really good.

1800
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:26,814
- Yeah, right.

1801
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,655
Can I ask you a question?

1802
01:11:33,657 --> 01:11:35,423
- Yeah.

1803
01:11:35,425 --> 01:11:38,893
- I hope you don't take it
the wrong way, but...

1804
01:11:38,895 --> 01:11:40,528
Why do you go out with Derrick?

1805
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:44,565
Sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.

1806
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:46,734
- No.

1807
01:11:46,736 --> 01:11:51,339
No, I ask myself that question
all the time.

1808
01:11:54,344 --> 01:11:56,978
I don't know.

1809
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:59,414
He's the quarterback.

1810
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:01,716
I'm the cheerleader.

1811
01:12:01,718 --> 01:12:05,086
It's what nature wants.

1812
01:12:07,857 --> 01:12:09,424
But I get what you're saying.

1813
01:12:09,426 --> 01:12:10,591
I shouldn't be dating someone

1814
01:12:10,593 --> 01:12:12,393
that I don't
really connect with.

1815
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:23,371
- Um...

1816
01:12:23,373 --> 01:12:25,473
He... he's probably wondering
where you are.

1817
01:12:25,475 --> 01:12:27,108
I don't know if you want
to go in,

1818
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:29,344
give him a call or something.

1819
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:31,012
Maybe that would, you know...

1820
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:34,015
- I love this song.

1821
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:38,753
- Do you guys have anyone
I can call for you?

1822
01:12:38,755 --> 01:12:40,588
A lawyer?
Anything?

1823
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:42,957
- Okay, don't pretend
to be a nice guy, Dan.

1824
01:12:42,959 --> 01:12:44,926
Yeah, we had a connection,
and yeah,

1825
01:12:44,928 --> 01:12:46,994
it's probably the liquor talking
that's making me say this,

1826
01:12:46,996 --> 01:12:49,897
but we probably could've been
something, and you blew it!

1827
01:12:49,899 --> 01:12:50,898
- You blew it!
- But...

1828
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,934
- yeah, you blew it!

1829
01:12:52,936 --> 01:12:54,569
- Hi.
- Yeah, you totally blew it.

1830
01:13:00,677 --> 01:13:04,479
- Oh, um, hey, you...
You work for Charlie, right?

1831
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:05,680
Where can I find her girlfriend?

1832
01:13:05,682 --> 01:13:07,548
- Uh, Claire left.
- What?

1833
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:10,618
- Yeah, she wasn't too stoked
about Charlie hulking out

1834
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,587
back there, so she left.

1835
01:13:12,589 --> 01:13:15,590
She told me to let Charlie know,
but I haven't seen her.

1836
01:13:15,592 --> 01:13:18,025
- Uh, that's 'cause
she got arrested.

1837
01:13:21,598 --> 01:13:23,398
Oh, god!
- Oh, hey, Dan.

1838
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:24,766
Hey, how's the retainer?

1839
01:13:24,768 --> 01:13:26,567
- It's good.
It's really tight.

1840
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:27,769
Thank you.

1841
01:13:27,771 --> 01:13:29,170
I was just wondering if you knew

1842
01:13:29,172 --> 01:13:30,605
where Charlie's girlfriend,
Claire, is.

1843
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:31,606
- Uh, no.

1844
01:13:31,608 --> 01:13:32,974
- What about Evie?

1845
01:13:32,976 --> 01:13:34,709
Does... does she have a boyfriend
I could call?

1846
01:13:34,711 --> 01:13:36,043
- She doesn't have a boyfriend.
She's married.

1847
01:13:36,045 --> 01:13:37,779
- Really?
- Yeah.

1848
01:13:37,781 --> 01:13:40,848
Yeah, her husband is, like,
some lawyer dude named Todd.

1849
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:51,459
- I am gonna get this dipped
in gold and put it on a chain

1850
01:13:51,461 --> 01:13:53,161
- you know, for a minute there,
I really thought you were gonna

1851
01:13:53,163 --> 01:13:54,243
go in and get a second one.

1852
01:13:55,632 --> 01:13:56,864
It would've made
amazing earrings.

1853
01:13:56,866 --> 01:13:57,899
- Oh.
- I should've done it.

1854
01:13:57,901 --> 01:13:59,000
- Yeah.
- But you did it.

1855
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:01,636
You finally... you pulled a tooth.

1856
01:14:01,638 --> 01:14:04,172
Now you can be, like,
a full orthodontist.

1857
01:14:04,174 --> 01:14:06,841
- Yeah, are you gonna
go back to school?

1858
01:14:06,843 --> 01:14:08,676
- You know what?

1859
01:14:08,678 --> 01:14:10,144
No.

1860
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:12,146
- Really?
- Yeah!

1861
01:14:12,148 --> 01:14:14,582
I like my job.

1862
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:16,451
It's low pressure,

1863
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:17,952
and I have fun with Jules,

1864
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,520
and I like it.

1865
01:14:19,522 --> 01:14:23,558
I'm not scared to do more.
I just like it.

1866
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:24,559
You know what else?

1867
01:14:24,561 --> 01:14:27,128
I... i like my organized fun.

1868
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:30,097
Like, I don't need to go out
to have a good time.

1869
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:31,766
You know what I think I do?

1870
01:14:31,768 --> 01:14:35,036
I put all this pressure
on myself because I just assume

1871
01:14:35,038 --> 01:14:38,506
that other people expect me
to be more or to want more

1872
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:40,775
'cause I'm, like,
an assistant who's a homebody,

1873
01:14:40,777 --> 01:14:42,076
but I love it!

1874
01:14:42,078 --> 01:14:44,045
- Amen.
- Get it.

1875
01:14:44,047 --> 01:14:46,714
- I want to be the weird aunt.

1876
01:14:46,716 --> 01:14:48,516
I do.
- Whoa.

1877
01:14:48,518 --> 01:14:49,984
This got serious.

1878
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:51,652
- Yeah, and speaking
of serious...

1879
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:53,120
Sorry, are you done
with your speech?

1880
01:14:53,122 --> 01:14:54,122
- Yeah, I am.
Thank you.

1881
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:56,958
Unnecessary.
- Got it.

1882
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,026
Speaking of serious,
I'm gonna be in serious trouble

1883
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:01,262
with Claire if we end up
spending the night here.

1884
01:15:01,264 --> 01:15:04,098
- No, you won't
because Claire is cool.

1885
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,534
- Yeah, she is cool.

1886
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:09,871
She's a cool fiancée.

1887
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:11,138
What?

1888
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:12,273
Seriously?
- Yeah.

1889
01:15:12,275 --> 01:15:14,609
- Oh, my god!
- What?

1890
01:15:14,611 --> 01:15:15,776
That's amazing!

1891
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:16,878
- Wait, why didn't you tell us?

1892
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,579
- I don't know.

1893
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:19,981
'Cause you guys are, like,
having nervous breakdowns

1894
01:15:19,983 --> 01:15:20,982
or whatever.

1895
01:15:20,984 --> 01:15:22,250
- Congratulations.

1896
01:15:22,252 --> 01:15:23,851
- Yeah, thank you,
but I really need to guys

1897
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:25,520
to act surprised when Claire
and I tell you together.

1898
01:15:25,522 --> 01:15:26,954
- I'm an actress.

1899
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:28,856
- Okay.
- Got it.

1900
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:30,625
- Also, I can throw you
an engagement party.

1901
01:15:30,627 --> 01:15:31,926
- Oh, my god.

1902
01:15:31,928 --> 01:15:33,027
No thank you.

1903
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:30,151
Kinsey.

1904
01:16:30,153 --> 01:16:32,954
Kinsey.

1905
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:33,988
Hi.

1906
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:35,623
- Hi.

1907
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:37,925
We must've fallen asleep
when we were talking.

1908
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:41,195
- Yeah, I g...
Yeah.

1909
01:16:41,197 --> 01:16:43,731
Um...
- That was really fun.

1910
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:46,834
- It was.
Last night was really fun.

1911
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:48,603
Um...

1912
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:56,243
It's fine.
I'm, uh...

1913
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:57,612
I'm gonna talk to him.

1914
01:16:57,614 --> 01:16:58,613
It's fine.

1915
01:16:58,615 --> 01:17:00,715
- Hey, Kinsey.

1916
01:17:00,717 --> 01:17:02,984
If we don't talk again
at school, or ever again,

1917
01:17:02,986 --> 01:17:04,185
for that matter,
I just want to let you know

1918
01:17:04,187 --> 01:17:05,386
that I really like you

1919
01:17:05,388 --> 01:17:06,754
and the reason I invited you
is because...

1920
01:17:06,756 --> 01:17:07,855
- Oliver.
Oliver.

1921
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:08,923
- Yeah?

1922
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:13,127
- I'm gonna handle this.

1923
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:17,932
But, yeah,
just message me later.

1924
01:17:17,934 --> 01:17:18,966
- Okay.
- Okay?

1925
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:21,235
- All right.
- Okay.

1926
01:17:21,237 --> 01:17:22,303
Okay.

1927
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:31,379
- Wake up, ladies!

1928
01:17:31,381 --> 01:17:33,814
I got good news
and I got bad news.

1929
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:35,416
- We will take
the good news please.

1930
01:17:35,418 --> 01:17:37,151
- I didn't ask
for your preference.

1931
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:39,186
The bad news is
you're probably gonna get

1932
01:17:39,188 --> 01:17:41,689
community service
for trespassing.

1933
01:17:41,691 --> 01:17:42,690
- That's not that bad.

1934
01:17:42,692 --> 01:17:44,959
- And public urination.

1935
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:47,128
The good news is
your lawyer's here.

1936
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,262
He's gonna get you out of here.

1937
01:17:48,264 --> 01:17:49,430
- Our lawyer?

1938
01:17:49,432 --> 01:17:51,265
- Todd Jones.

1939
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:55,002
- Let's do this.

1940
01:18:02,277 --> 01:18:03,344
- Thank you.

1941
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:06,814
Hi, Todd.
- Mm-mm.

1942
01:18:06,816 --> 01:18:07,882
- Okay.

1943
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:14,689
- Evie, what did you do?

1944
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:16,057
- I'm fine, Todd.

1945
01:18:16,059 --> 01:18:17,958
Thank you for asking.

1946
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,360
Why aren't you in vail?

1947
01:18:19,362 --> 01:18:22,029
- Well, some guy named Dan
calls me,

1948
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:24,031
tells me
that you've been arrested,

1949
01:18:24,033 --> 01:18:27,068
so I take the first flight back.

1950
01:18:27,070 --> 01:18:29,870
I... i can't believe this.

1951
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:34,108
Do you have any idea
how bad this makes me look?

1952
01:18:34,110 --> 01:18:35,710
- And that's what
you're concerned about.

1953
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:37,745
Okay.
- Yes, Evie.

1954
01:18:37,747 --> 01:18:41,215
Well, I'm a lawyer, so I can't
be bailing people out of jail.

1955
01:18:41,217 --> 01:18:44,485
- I spent the night
in the drunk tank.

1956
01:18:44,487 --> 01:18:46,921
- I don't ask for a lot.

1957
01:18:46,923 --> 01:18:49,123
I let you do your little
work stuff.

1958
01:18:49,125 --> 01:18:53,327
I let you hang out
with those two idiots.

1959
01:18:53,329 --> 01:18:55,396
But at the end of the day,

1960
01:18:55,398 --> 01:18:59,133
I'm the one
who takes care of you.

1961
01:18:59,135 --> 01:19:03,304
- What if I don't need someone
to take care of me?

1962
01:19:03,306 --> 01:19:07,308
What if I can take care of
myself?

1963
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,850
- Whoa!
- Oh, god.

1964
01:19:15,852 --> 01:19:17,284
You know,
prison is not comfortable.

1965
01:19:17,286 --> 01:19:18,385
- Hi!

1966
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:19,386
She gave me a weird look.

1967
01:19:19,388 --> 01:19:21,222
God.

1968
01:19:21,224 --> 01:19:22,990
- My girlfriend's a criminal!

1969
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:26,460
- Gonna give you a minute.

1970
01:19:26,462 --> 01:19:28,362
- Yeah, thanks.

1971
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:42,443
- I am so sorry
about last night.

1972
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,178
- You're a god damn maniac.

1973
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:45,513
- True.

1974
01:19:45,515 --> 01:19:49,150
But for good reason.

1975
01:19:49,152 --> 01:19:51,519
- Peter Finch, athletic director
at Lincoln high school?

1976
01:19:51,521 --> 01:19:53,287
- I told Peter
that if I made him look like

1977
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:55,222
a total badass at the party
last night,

1978
01:19:55,224 --> 01:19:57,258
that he'd have to give me
the entire uniform account

1979
01:19:57,260 --> 01:19:58,859
of Lincoln high.

1980
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:00,327
Huh?
It's not bad.

1981
01:20:02,431 --> 01:20:03,497
- You stink real bad.

1982
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:05,166
- I was in prison.
- Oh.

1983
01:20:05,168 --> 01:20:06,967
- I learned all sorts of shit.
- Oh.

1984
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:08,035
- Hi.

1985
01:20:08,037 --> 01:20:10,137
- Hey, there.

1986
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:12,807
- So just so you know,
I drove Ashley home

1987
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:14,141
so she wouldn't drive drunk.

1988
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:17,144
- Yeah, no, you do not
have to explain yourself.

1989
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:19,280
I got crazy last night.

1990
01:20:19,282 --> 01:20:21,115
- A little crazy
is when a bachelorette party

1991
01:20:21,117 --> 01:20:22,116
hires a stripper.

1992
01:20:22,118 --> 01:20:23,484
- Oh.

1993
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:24,885
- You ripped a tooth
out of a woman's jaw.

1994
01:20:24,887 --> 01:20:26,487
- Yeah, I did that.

1995
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:27,855
- Yeah, you did.

1996
01:20:27,857 --> 01:20:29,256
- Didn't know
I was such a badass.

1997
01:20:29,258 --> 01:20:30,558
- Uh, no, I did not know that.

1998
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:35,162
- Can I give you a ride?

1999
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:38,432
- Actually, do you want to grab
some breakfast?

2000
01:20:39,468 --> 01:20:41,335
- Are you asking me on a date?

2001
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:42,570
- Are you scared?

2002
01:20:45,007 --> 01:20:46,173
- Evie, can you just relax?

2003
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:47,474
- Nope.

2004
01:20:47,476 --> 01:20:48,943
- No, are... you're seriously
gonna do this?

2005
01:20:48,945 --> 01:20:50,911
- Yes.
Hey, guys, can I grab a ride?

2006
01:20:50,913 --> 01:20:52,446
- Oh, all right.
Well, sounds good then.

2007
01:20:52,448 --> 01:20:54,548
You just... you take a few nights
to cool off.

2008
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:56,116
I'll stay with my parents.

2009
01:20:56,118 --> 01:20:58,319
- Wait.
Where are your parents?

2010
01:20:59,522 --> 01:21:01,522
- I dropped them off
on my way here.

2011
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:12,933
- Oh, are you guys the butlers?

2012
01:21:12,935 --> 01:21:15,002
Oh, we'll have two full
English breakfasts please,

2013
01:21:15,004 --> 01:21:17,004
and I'll take my bacon
nice and crispy.

2014
01:21:17,006 --> 01:21:18,172
And did you want to add
something?

2015
01:21:18,174 --> 01:21:19,907
- Scotch.
- Just a scotch for her.

2016
01:21:23,246 --> 01:21:26,380
<i>- Dear 30-year-old Kate,</i>

2017
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:28,282

on your birthday,</i>

2018

<i>you'll have the greatest guy

2019
01:21:29,518 --> 01:21:31,385
Oh, thank you.

2020
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:34,154
<i>He'll be handsome
and sweet and funny.</i>

2021
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:35,155
How's the sangria?

2022
01:21:35,157 --> 01:21:36,357
- It's nice.

2023
01:21:36,359 --> 01:21:37,558
- Yeah?
- Just your type of sangria.

2024
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,226
- It's so strong, by the way.

2025
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:41,195
<i>You'll be
a super successful orthodontist</i>

2026
01:21:41,197 --> 01:21:42,496
<i>with your own practice.</i>

2027
01:21:42,498 --> 01:21:43,530
<i>You go, girl!</i>

2028
01:21:43,532 --> 01:21:45,032
I got it dipped in gold.

2029
01:21:45,034 --> 01:21:46,300
- Oh, my god.
- You really did it.

2030
01:21:46,302 --> 01:21:48,168
- I know.
It looks awesome, right?

2031
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:50,671
<i>Of course, there's gonna be
a little one to take care of</i>

2032
01:21:50,673 --> 01:21:52,539
<i>or at least a bun in the oven.</i>

2033
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:54,341

<i>- I'll see you...</i>

2038
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:02,449
- Hmm?
- Hi.

2039
01:22:02,451 --> 01:22:03,450
Did you hear what we said?

2040
01:22:03,452 --> 01:22:05,452
- What?

2041
01:22:05,454 --> 01:22:08,055
- We're engaged.

2042
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:11,392
Oh, my god!

2043
01:22:11,394 --> 01:22:12,993
- So unexpected!
- Wow.

2044
01:22:12,995 --> 01:22:14,495
Yeah.

2045
01:22:14,497 --> 01:22:16,664
Wow.
- Big news.

2046
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:18,065
- You told them.

2047
01:22:18,067 --> 01:22:20,301
- I swear to god I didn't...

2048
01:22:20,303 --> 01:22:21,669
Except for that one time
in jail.

2049
01:22:21,671 --> 01:22:23,037
- Yeah.

2050
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:24,038
- I promise you,
it's news to me.

2051
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:25,172
- Can I be a bridesmaid?

2052
01:22:25,174 --> 01:22:26,273
- You already are.

2053
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:27,641
- For which one?

2054
01:22:27,643 --> 01:22:28,642
