00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:26,909
You know what to do.

188
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:28,476
Boyfriend, family...

189
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,391
Work problems.

190
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:33,220
How's the witness?

191
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:55,372
Crimetime?

192
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,070
Is Archer there?

193
00:14:57,113 --> 00:15:00,943
Tell him crowley from central
has got something for him.

194
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:03,903
Yeah, that's right.
Something good.

195
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,992
Tell him...

196
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,996
Tell him I'll be
waiting his call.

197
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,966
One stocking...

198
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:29,363
And... one... eye...

199
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:32,409
Removed.

200
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:01,395
[Door opens]

201
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:26,986
[Door unlocks]

202
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,011
[Sighs]

203
00:18:00,427 --> 00:18:03,995
Woman: Sidney!

204
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:06,041
Sidney!

205
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:12,961
Oh, it's nothing but drugs.

206
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:14,658
What's that?

207
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:19,489
Drugs, drugs, drugs. That's all
you hear these days. Disgusting!

208
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:23,798
That's the newspapers
for you, Thelma.

209
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:27,541
Do you have to work
so late, Sidney?

210
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:28,585
I missed you.

211
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:32,546
I'll stay in
tomorrow night. Promise.

212
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:36,027
We'll watch some television.

213
00:18:40,815 --> 00:18:42,512
Sidney.

214
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,039
Come and keep me warm!

215
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:10,105
I've just got to do something.

216
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,325
Won't be a minute.

217
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:05,029
Hi, and how are you today?

218
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:32,622
Max...

219
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,624
Let's start with the bad news.

220
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:38,976
Starline's coming out with 2
new crime programs in June.

221
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,893
That makes 5 that we've
got to compete with.

222
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:45,287
So make sure our people
get the word...

223
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:48,334
Get to the crime scene first.

224
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:52,338
Which means keeping our
police contacts sweet.

225
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:53,991
Right?

226
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,385
So...

227
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:58,431
What do we have
on the table this week?

228
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:00,389
Oh, the usual crop, Millie.

229
00:21:00,433 --> 00:21:01,608
Best of the bunch is

230
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:04,393
black baby stoned to death
in everhappy park,

231
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:10,094
blind man and his dog incinerated on
their way to pick up some dry cleaning,

232
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:11,748
and a perv killing...

233
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:15,274
Perpetrator cut out the victim's
eye and removed one stocking.

234
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:18,320
Should be something in that lot.

235
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:19,060
Harry?

236
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:21,236
Let's go with the dog.

237
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,890
A dog's got character.

238
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:23,717
Mort?

239
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,935
Oh, I couldn't agree more.

240
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:26,372
Dogs always go down well.

241
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:28,939
Ok, ok, I'm getting it.

242
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:32,378
Old man and dog
walking down the street...

243
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:35,685
Everybody knows them,
everybody loves them,

244
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:36,947
especially the dog.

245
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:40,124
People pat it. Children
walk by its side.

246
00:21:40,168 --> 00:21:42,562
Suddenly 2 thugs appear
with a can of petrol.

247
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:44,346
Young woman screams,
"no, no!"

248
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,349
I've got the young
woman... Julia Stein.

249
00:21:47,393 --> 00:21:48,481
Perfect.

250
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:50,091
Old man and dog
get covered with petrol.

251
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:52,398
Poof. Up they go
like Roman candles.

252
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:54,225
Young woman turns to camera,

253
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:55,507
uh, "if you saw this attack
last Thursday",

254
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:58,360
please contact crimetime,"
so and so...

255
00:21:58,404 --> 00:21:59,622
Would it be possible

256
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,078
to get a dog from the
pound and set it alight?

257
00:22:01,102 --> 00:22:04,061
I think animal welfare would
have a problem with that.

258
00:22:04,105 --> 00:22:05,280
It'll appeal to the kids.

259
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,415
Moving right along now
to the eye remover...

260
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:14,071
I have a really good
feeling on this one.

261
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:15,899
Max.

262
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:18,380
Well, we've got a witness.

263
00:22:18,424 --> 00:22:22,384
A wino saw the woman with a
man minutes before the killing.

264
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:24,299
We've got a description.

265
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:28,695
Yeah. "Longish
blond hair and stocky."

266
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:29,609
Have we got anyone?

267
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,480
Someone we haven't used before.

268
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:35,397
Well, they're getting a
bit thin on the ground,

269
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:36,398
but, um...

270
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:40,794
Yeah, I think
I may have someone.

271
00:23:26,753 --> 00:23:29,277
Bobby, we're ready for you now.

272
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,583
Ok.

273
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,128
One pair of cord
trousers, light brown...

274
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:56,696
These are a bit
dark, but they'll do.

275
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:59,481
One black
wind-cheater type coat.

276
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:01,483
Got that.

277
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:03,833
And he could have worn a tie,

278
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:06,793
so the choice is yours.

279
00:24:37,258 --> 00:24:39,216
This is it.

280
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:42,568
I feel it.
This is it.

281
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:45,396
Bobby:
Taxi driver...

282
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,442
You see it?

283
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,010
The gun scene?

284
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:54,667
De niro choosing the gun.

285
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:03,763
This one looks nasty.

286
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:05,025
It is.

287
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:08,768
We try to be accurate
except for some details.

288
00:25:09,464 --> 00:25:11,422
What details?

289
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,600
I can't give too much away.

290
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:15,905
Copycat killers.

291
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:19,082
Crazies who phone up
confessing to anything.

292
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:20,040
Censors.

293
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:21,824
Come on, guys, give me a detail.

294
00:25:21,868 --> 00:25:27,700
I need a little detail, you know,
make me feel like part of the gang.

295
00:25:27,743 --> 00:25:30,659
Just between us, ok, Bobby?

296
00:25:30,703 --> 00:25:32,443
Absolutely.

297
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:34,489
The left eye.

298
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:38,058
What?

299
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:39,538
He cut it out.

300
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:44,586
Slid the knife all
around, and out it came.

301
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:46,632
Like spooning out jelly.

302
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:50,374
It's appalling. Very
nasty. Defies belief.

303
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:52,899
Pity we can't show it.

304
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:58,426
And he did it with the
kind of knife you're holding.

305
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:03,562
When you're ready, val,
let's rehearse.

306
00:26:04,432 --> 00:26:06,303
He's keen.

307
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:30,414
Hi, handsome.

308
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:34,636
It's weird, isn't it?

309
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,987
This is where he was sitting.

310
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:41,164
He sat down right here,

311
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:44,428
and then he looked up
and saw you.

312
00:26:44,472 --> 00:26:45,821
Her, Bobby.

313
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:46,909
Her.

314
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:48,563
Do you remember me,

315
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,567
your friendly
neighborhood victim?

316
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,047
What do you think, ged?

317
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,484
It's not very
politically correct, is it,

318
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:59,443
using me as the victim
over and over.

319
00:26:59,487 --> 00:27:01,532
Do you know why they do that?

320
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:02,577
No.

321
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,667
Because they all
look the same dead.

322
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:09,323
Besides, who cares about them?

323
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:11,891
You're the one they care about.

324
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:13,327
You're the star.

325
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,722
Let's shoot this, then,
shall we, and then move on?

326
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:19,246
Come on, crank it up.

327
00:27:27,123 --> 00:27:28,385
Always check the tape.

328
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:30,605
Means it's a prop.

329
00:27:31,562 --> 00:27:32,476
Ok, Bobby...

330
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,739
Let's see what it looks like.

331
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:36,306
Stick it in her stomach.

332
00:27:42,965 --> 00:27:44,401
Bobby...

333
00:27:44,445 --> 00:27:46,142
Love...

334
00:27:46,186 --> 00:27:48,101
We're waiting.

335
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:03,943
Val...

336
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:05,640
Sweetheart...

337
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,947
You're not helping.

338
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,730
All night?

339
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:10,601
I'm a person, you know?

340
00:28:10,645 --> 00:28:11,646
I'm not a thief.

341
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,090
Ok, I understand
that. I understand.

342
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:15,868
All we're asking you to
do is pay a little attention.

343
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:16,912
Ha ha ha...

344
00:28:16,956 --> 00:28:20,568
Look, we're paying
you, aren't we?

345
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:23,614
Bobby,

346
00:28:23,658 --> 00:28:24,833
you-you're almost there.

347
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:28,794
I just feel you're
holding something back.

348
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:31,753
I know. I know.

349
00:28:31,797 --> 00:28:32,841
I...

350
00:28:32,885 --> 00:28:35,626
I just need to feel
what he felt here.

351
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:38,020
I just need to get
under his fingernails.

352
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:40,457
Yeah, well, I admire
your commitment, Bobby,

353
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:41,676
but just slice the bitch up,

354
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,810
and we can all get a
pizza and go home, ok?

355
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:52,382
Just slice the bitch up,

356
00:28:52,426 --> 00:28:56,125
then we can all get
some pizza and go home.

357
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:57,474
Why didn't I think of that?

358
00:28:57,518 --> 00:29:00,782
Running very short of time...

359
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:03,698
So reach deep within, Bobby.

360
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,745
Let's see that lurking devil.

361
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:15,754
Where's the knife?

362
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:39,647
Ok, Bobby...

363
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:49,831
[Fly buzzes]

364
00:29:49,875 --> 00:29:51,659
[Bang]

365
00:29:51,702 --> 00:29:53,574
Now.

366
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:55,663
You really did the job.

367
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:58,797
And you know what
I'm hoping for you?

368
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,624
No, I don't.

369
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:01,843
For your sake,

370
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:05,804
I hope the cunt does it again.

371
00:30:05,847 --> 00:30:07,457
Anything to keep you off

372
00:30:07,501 --> 00:30:09,851
the unemployment line, Bobby.

373
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:27,042
I need some air.

374
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:54,461
Hey, Bobby, seriously...

375
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:56,550
We did some good work today.

376
00:30:56,593 --> 00:30:57,768
Thanks.

377
00:30:57,812 --> 00:31:00,510
And good night, my
precious little victim.

378
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:03,426
Mm, you sweet talker, you.

379
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,386
Simon...

380
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:10,259
What do you think
he's doing right now?

381
00:31:10,303 --> 00:31:11,391
Who?

382
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:12,218
Him.

383
00:31:12,261 --> 00:31:14,394
The guy that did it...

384
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:16,135
That killed the girl.

385
00:31:16,178 --> 00:31:17,701
Who cares?

386
00:31:17,745 --> 00:31:19,355
Be good.

387
00:31:20,443 --> 00:31:21,923
You hear that?

388
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:24,099
I care.

389
00:31:26,754 --> 00:31:28,277
You are mar...

390
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:29,800
You are marvelous.

391
00:31:29,844 --> 00:31:32,107
Marvelous.

392
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:39,419
See ya later, Bobby.

393
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:56,088
Bobby's gonna be a big star.

394
00:31:56,131 --> 00:31:59,221
Bobby deserves a prize.

395
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:12,539
[Whispering]
I'm a real lady-killer.

396
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:17,413
Aah... ha ha...

397
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:56,757
TV: Last night a young girl was
horribly mutilated and murdered

398
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,106
here in tadget's alleyway...

399
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:02,981
Now here's something
that shouldn't be here.

400
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:05,505
Oh, good heavens.

401
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:06,375
Poor thing.

402
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:07,942
I put some poison down.

403
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,422
I suppose it worked.

404
00:33:09,465 --> 00:33:10,814
I think it did.

405
00:33:10,858 --> 00:33:13,382
Must have crawled in
through this hole at the back

406
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:15,994
looking for a warm place to die.

407
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:19,736
It short-circuited
this connection, anyway.

408
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,781
Easy fix.

409
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:22,261
Have it done
in a couple of seconds.

410
00:33:22,304 --> 00:33:27,440
TV: Please ring our
crimetime number immediately.

411
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:43,586
Can I get you another drink?

412
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:46,372
I'll have a vodka and orange.

413
00:33:46,415 --> 00:33:47,677
Another whiskey, please,

414
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:49,853
and a vodka and
orange for the lady.

415
00:33:49,897 --> 00:33:51,116
How's your wife, Sidney?

416
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:53,379
Have you had a second opinion?

417
00:33:53,422 --> 00:33:54,380
What?

418
00:33:54,423 --> 00:33:55,642
A second opinion.

419
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:57,078
I swear by them.

420
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:58,427
I'm sick of this place.

421
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:00,386
Let's go for a walk.

422
00:34:00,429 --> 00:34:01,387
Oh.

423
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:03,389
Val:
It's getting colder.

424
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:06,522
He holds himself
well, doesn't he?

425
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:08,481
Here, let me keep you warm.

426
00:34:08,524 --> 00:34:09,656
I'm sorry?

427
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:12,354
Oh, that terrible man.

428
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:14,965
Appearances can be deceptive.

429
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:17,359
He's only an actor,
Mrs. Kravatz.

430
00:34:17,403 --> 00:34:18,491
Only an actor?

431
00:34:18,534 --> 00:34:21,102
He seems real enough to me.

432
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:22,016
Have a biscuit.

433
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,539
Val: Stop.
You're hurting me...

434
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:26,847
Bobby: What
do you want?

435
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,156
Oh!

436
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,506
Aah!

437
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,899
Were you there?

438
00:34:35,943 --> 00:34:37,510
Did you see anything?

439
00:34:37,553 --> 00:34:40,382
If you did, phone crimetime

440
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:42,863
on 0-1-7-1.

441
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:54,396
Sidney...

442
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:55,832
Is that you?

443
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:57,138
Of course it's me.

444
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:58,400
Who else would it be?

445
00:34:58,444 --> 00:35:00,315
Sidney!

446
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:01,534
I'm sorry.

447
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:03,144
I've had a hard morning.

448
00:35:03,188 --> 00:35:05,146
Well, don't take it out on me.

449
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:06,191
Come...

450
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:10,151
I'll make us a nice
cup of tea, hmm?

451
00:35:10,195 --> 00:35:13,546
Mahon. Bobby mahon.

452
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:16,418
Thank you.

453
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:20,248
Yes. Never miss a show.

454
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:21,597
Bye.

455
00:35:41,443 --> 00:35:43,358
Mahon...

456
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:45,404
Mahon.

457
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:57,372
Answering machine:
I'm not in.

458
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:58,634
You know what to do.

459
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:00,245
[Beep]

460
00:36:06,425 --> 00:36:08,209
[Beep]

461
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:25,835
Walter Prescott here.

462
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:26,880
Sorry, Bobby.

463
00:36:26,923 --> 00:36:28,490
The lyceum decided
on the other guy.

464
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:32,842
We should get some response
from crimetime, though.

465
00:36:32,886 --> 00:36:35,018
Don't give up.

466
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:35,932
[Beep]

467
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:37,238
Hi, Bobby.

468
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:38,631
Nicki Weyland
from crimetimehere.

469
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:41,329
Millicent wants to see
you this afternoon at 3:00.

470
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:45,377
Can you give me a call if
you can't make it? Thanks.

471
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,291
[Beep]

472
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:49,642
Sidney: Why...
Didn't she cry?

473
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:51,426
[Rewinding]

474
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:07,355
Why... didn't she cry?

475
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:09,183
[Beep]

476
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:25,155
[Bang]

477
00:37:49,397 --> 00:37:50,529
Ok?

478
00:37:50,572 --> 00:37:52,270
Ok. Thanks.

479
00:37:52,618 --> 00:37:54,359
I'm Bobby mahon.

480
00:37:54,402 --> 00:37:56,404
I know.

481
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:59,799
You can go through.

482
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,158
[Knocking]

483
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,167
Yes?

484
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:22,691
Bobby.

485
00:38:22,735 --> 00:38:24,389
Come in.

486
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:27,914
Bobby, this is Max bentwhistle,

487
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:31,831
one of crimetime's producers.

488
00:38:31,874 --> 00:38:32,919
Hello.

489
00:38:32,962 --> 00:38:35,400
Congratulations
on last night's show.

490
00:38:35,443 --> 00:38:36,488
Oh, thank you.

491
00:38:36,531 --> 00:38:38,359
Have you told him
about the response?

492
00:38:38,403 --> 00:38:41,275
I wanted you to be here, Max,

493
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,755
when I told Bobby.

494
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:45,105
Sit down.

495
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:48,369
Bobby...

496
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,371
Do you know how many phone calls

497
00:38:50,415 --> 00:38:53,418
we usually receive after a show?

498
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:54,941
I have no idea.

499
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:56,551
Between 80 and 100.

500
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:58,510
And do you know
how many phone calls

501
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:02,383
we received after
last night's show?

502
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:04,385
Tell him, Max.

503
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:06,387
450, Bobby.

504
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:07,519
450.

505
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:09,390
That's more than
we've ever had before.

506
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:11,107
That's more than the
knitting needle killings

507
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:15,440
and the southside
granny strangler combined.

508
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:17,442
You really made a hit.

509
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:19,400
Your passion, your violence

510
00:39:19,444 --> 00:39:23,404
really went over well
with our audience.

511
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:24,884
And...

512
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:30,237
We appreciate it, Bobby.

513
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,940
Thank you.

514
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,857
Of course, we all hope that this
maniac gets caught, and soon, but...

515
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:45,165
If he doesn't and kills again,

516
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,385
well...

517
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,865
Don't leave town,

518
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:51,998
hmm, Bobby?

519
00:40:12,235 --> 00:40:15,413
Do you know the way out?

520
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:18,416
Yes.

521
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:25,205
I'm not lying. He
was fucking brilliant.

522
00:40:25,248 --> 00:40:26,400
I mean, he's usually quite tame,

523
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,862
but last night he
was such an animal.

524
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:31,603
And you were gonna Chuck him.

525
00:40:31,646 --> 00:40:33,039
I didn't say that.

526
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:35,694
I just said that he was
a little intense, that's all.

527
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:39,611
Yeah. The one thing I
can't stand is a polite fuck.

528
00:40:39,654 --> 00:40:40,525
Hello.

529
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:42,178
Hi. See you
later, val.

530
00:40:42,222 --> 00:40:43,484
Oh, Bobby, I missed your show,

531
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:46,182
but I'll catch the repeat later.

532
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:47,009
6:00.

533
00:40:47,053 --> 00:40:48,228
Heard you were marvelous.

534
00:40:48,271 --> 00:40:49,814
Heard you were pretty
marvelous last night.

535
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:52,667
I hope you bought her
some new ones, you animal.

536
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:54,060
Watch out, val.

537
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:55,714
You know what they say
about these actors

538
00:40:55,757 --> 00:40:58,456
once they've got their
teeth into your part.

539
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:01,371
She seems in top form.

540
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:02,895
Mm. She is.

541
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:05,593
So what happened today then?

542
00:41:09,205 --> 00:41:11,730
So did you tell the police?

543
00:41:11,773 --> 00:41:13,906
What's the point?

544
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:15,516
He could be anyone.

545
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,909
It could mean anything.

546
00:41:16,952 --> 00:41:19,433
"Why didn't she cry" isn't
what I would call normal.

547
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,783
Tell the police, Bobby.
You never know.

548
00:41:21,827 --> 00:41:24,307
He's a nut, right?

549
00:41:24,351 --> 00:41:26,440
But it could be interesting.

550
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,660
Besides, I'm not
keeping it to myself.

551
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:30,836
I'm telling you, aren't I?

552
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:32,490
Ok.

553
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:38,452
Should I have cried,
do you think?

554
00:41:39,627 --> 00:41:43,718
Anyway, it's good news
about the meeting.

555
00:41:43,762 --> 00:41:45,415
Yeah, I suppose so.

You suppose so?

558
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,377
and you suppose it's good?

559
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,512
Crimetimeis a crap show, val.

560
00:41:55,425 --> 00:41:57,079
But in a way...

561
00:41:57,123 --> 00:41:59,821
It's more real than Macbeth.

562
00:41:59,865 --> 00:42:02,955
Did I tell you that Charley
torrance, the photographer...

563
00:42:02,998 --> 00:42:06,132
I mean, this guy, he's real.

564
00:42:06,175 --> 00:42:07,263
He could be anyone.

565
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:09,004
He could be checking
you out right now.

566
00:42:09,048 --> 00:42:11,964
Thanks. I was feeling
a little neglected.

567

Look, all I'm saying is,

568
00:42:13,879 --> 00:42:15,837
crimetimeis crap,

569
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:18,623
but even with crap
you can do something.

really get under his skin,

572
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:23,845
Come on, Bobby, calm down.

573
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:26,108
Let's face it... it was
probably a one off.

574
00:42:26,152 --> 00:42:28,415
You'll never get the
chance to do it again.

575
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:30,460
The cop doesn't think so...

576
00:42:30,504 --> 00:42:33,463
Because of the eye.

577
00:42:34,421 --> 00:42:35,814
The eye?

578
00:42:35,857 --> 00:42:38,077
He cut out the left eye.

579
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,732
They're keeping it quiet.

580
00:42:40,775 --> 00:42:42,385
But they told you.

581
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:43,473
I wanted to know.

582
00:42:43,517 --> 00:42:45,301
I wanted to know everything.

583
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:48,566
Next time they're gonna
let me see the body.

584
00:42:48,914 --> 00:42:49,741
Pretty grisly, hmm?

585
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:51,525
That's marvelous, Bobby.

Ready yet?

587
00:42:52,395 --> 00:42:53,309
Why do you think he did it?

588
00:42:53,353 --> 00:42:54,615
I don't need to know that, do I?

589
00:42:54,659 --> 00:42:57,792
All I need to know
is how to die.

590
00:42:57,836 --> 00:43:01,013
So what do you fancy?

591
00:43:01,056 --> 00:43:02,536
I told you that Charley torrance

592
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,905
wants to do an
exhibition of photos of me

593
00:43:03,929 --> 00:43:07,976

victims, didn't I?

594
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:08,977
Shall I come back?

At the whitehall gallery.

596
00:43:13,025 --> 00:43:14,592
Why did he choose her?

597
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:17,507
What made her so special?

598
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:19,945
Can we talk about
something lighter?

599
00:43:19,988 --> 00:43:23,426
I'm hungry, Bobby.
Hungry.

00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:30,433
Well, I suppose you're right.

601

It's probably just a one off.

00:52:27,492 --> 00:52:29,146
Well, the...

737
00:52:29,189 --> 00:52:34,629
The point, Bobby, is to get
people to watch the show.

738
00:52:34,673 --> 00:52:36,892
Well... simon...

739
00:52:36,936 --> 00:52:39,330
Don't we want him caught?

740
00:52:39,373 --> 00:52:41,201
Well... nice one, Bobby,

741
00:52:41,245 --> 00:52:43,334
but the bottom line is
you're too anonymous.

742
00:52:43,377 --> 00:52:46,380
Maybe if you put some
thought into it, you'd realize,

743
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:48,861
perhaps heis anonymous.

744
00:52:48,904 --> 00:52:50,515
I mean, all this jazzing him up

745
00:52:50,558 --> 00:52:53,431
is... is... is just a load of shit!

746
00:52:53,953 --> 00:52:56,173
If you want a puppet
to dress up,

747
00:52:56,216 --> 00:52:59,393
I suggest you go out
and find one!

748
00:52:59,437 --> 00:53:01,134
Or is that what I am?!

749
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,223
Am I a puppet?!

750
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:13,407
Look, I'm sorry.

751
00:53:13,451 --> 00:53:15,496
Hey, look...

752
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,195
Don't kill the golden
goose, Bobby.

753
00:53:18,499 --> 00:53:22,460
I know you care,
but, um, to the suits...

754
00:53:22,503 --> 00:53:26,246
You're just another name
on a long list of names.

755
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:27,421
This morning, you're here.

756
00:53:27,465 --> 00:53:29,684
This afternoon...

757
00:53:29,728 --> 00:53:31,773
Capisce?

758
00:53:31,817 --> 00:53:36,909
So be a good boy and put
on the party clothes, ok?

759
00:53:36,952 --> 00:53:39,520
Gwenda: Simon?

760
00:53:39,564 --> 00:53:41,566
Perfect.

761
00:53:41,609 --> 00:53:43,394
Bobby?

762
00:53:45,483 --> 00:53:47,702
Yeah, sure.

763
00:53:47,746 --> 00:53:49,661
Perfect.

764
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,192
You'll get a lot of crank calls.

765
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,542
What did he say again?

766
00:54:01,586 --> 00:54:04,371
"Remember
how soft they are."

767
00:54:04,415 --> 00:54:06,243
It could mean anything.

768
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:08,375
So it means nothing.

769
00:54:08,419 --> 00:54:10,290
When they mention things
the public can't,

770
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:11,639
like the eye, for instance,

771
00:54:11,683 --> 00:54:13,946
that's when we get interested.

772
00:54:13,989 --> 00:54:16,470
So don't worry.

773
00:54:16,514 --> 00:54:19,865
Or get an unlisted number.

774
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,476
Right.

775
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,086
Let's get to work.

776
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:28,830
So... what do you
want to know today?

777
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:34,575
Tell me about the wounds.

778
00:54:37,665 --> 00:54:40,842
The first one was
in the stomach.

779
00:54:40,886 --> 00:54:42,409
The knife went in...

780
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:45,456
And immediately
it was forced upwards.

781
00:54:45,499 --> 00:54:47,719
Would that take much force?

782
00:54:47,762 --> 00:54:50,374
With a knife this sharp,
hardly any force at all.

783
00:54:50,417 --> 00:54:53,246
You wouldn't feel anything
until it was well in,

784
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,465
doing the damage.

785
00:54:54,508 --> 00:54:59,731
No bones to deal with,
no, eh... Obstructions.

786
00:54:59,774 --> 00:55:03,822
Before she knew it, her
stomach would be in shreds.

787
00:55:03,865 --> 00:55:05,693
It would take time.

788
00:55:05,737 --> 00:55:07,086
He didn't give her that time.

789
00:55:07,129 --> 00:55:09,741
He pulled the knife out,
and, still holding her up...

790
00:55:09,784 --> 00:55:12,439
Would there have been
a lot of blood?

791
00:55:12,483 --> 00:55:13,353
Not much.

792
00:55:13,397 --> 00:55:14,615
See, the knife is so thin,

793
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:17,488
all the bleeding
would be internal.

794
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:20,708
And, as far as we can ascertain,

795
00:55:20,752 --> 00:55:23,058
he stabbed her
in the lower back.

796
00:55:23,102 --> 00:55:25,800
The knife passed
through one kidney,

797
00:55:25,844 --> 00:55:28,281
but couldn't go any further...

798
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:30,370
'Cause of the backbone.

799
00:55:30,414 --> 00:55:32,241
Then he let her fall.

800
00:55:32,285 --> 00:55:33,330
Ahhh!
Ha ha ha ha ha!

801
00:55:33,373 --> 00:55:36,333
Come on!
Will you just pretend?

802
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:37,986
Ok. Ok.

You think it's funny?

805
00:55:41,163 --> 00:55:42,164
Bobby...

806
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,228
You think she thought
it was funny?

807
00:55:43,252 --> 00:55:44,210
Was she laughing?

808
00:55:44,253 --> 00:55:47,300
I think you're
getting very heavy.

809
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:51,086
Come on.
Be nice to me.

810
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:04,578
The blade got caught
between her vertebrae,

811
00:56:04,622 --> 00:56:06,232
and he had to...

812
00:56:06,275 --> 00:56:07,625
Yank it out!

813
00:56:07,668 --> 00:56:09,496
Oh, I felt that.

814
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,671
Would you?

815
00:56:10,715 --> 00:56:13,326
When the knife's so sharp...

816
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,762
And you're so soft?

817
00:56:14,806 --> 00:56:17,939
Sick, Bobby.
Very sick.

818
00:56:17,983 --> 00:56:19,114
Then... this!

00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:37,176
He cut the eye out.

01:05:11,255 --> 01:05:12,386
Lagrave: Bobby mahon,

920
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:14,301
the star of the crimetimeshow!

921

Everything's become source
material for entertainment.

923

On the contrary,

924
01:05:20,829 --> 01:05:23,093
the public really does
want to know the truth.

925
01:05:23,136 --> 01:05:24,094
Oh, come on, Millie.

926
01:05:24,137 --> 01:05:26,531
You don't care about
the monsters.

927
01:05:26,574 --> 01:05:28,011
You just use them.

928
01:05:28,054 --> 01:05:31,362
How do you make him
so horribly normal?

929
01:05:31,405 --> 01:05:33,016
I look for him.

930
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:34,539
Doesn't it scare you?

931
01:05:34,582 --> 01:05:35,801
Scare me?

932

Lagrave: Are you
scared, Bobby?

933
01:05:37,498 --> 01:05:39,413
Does it affect you, Bobby?

934
01:05:39,457 --> 01:05:40,371

Why don't you show them, Bobby?

936
01:05:41,807 --> 01:05:42,808

937
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:45,419
Why don't you show
them? Show them.

938

Why don't you show them?

939
01:05:49,162 --> 01:05:51,599
Oh!

940

Lagrave: Oh, I love you
when you bleed.

944
01:06:03,872 --> 01:06:05,918
I'm sorry?

945
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:09,617
I said, that's show business.

946
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:12,098
Am I right, Bobby?

947

So, how you doing?

948
01:06:48,482 --> 01:06:49,788

949
01:06:50,832 --> 01:06:53,835
Oh, I'm not so bad.

950
01:06:53,879 --> 01:06:56,360
Not so bad.

951
01:06:59,972 --> 01:07:02,757
I get a little...

952
01:07:04,585 --> 01:07:06,761
Confused sometimes.

953
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:14,378
Do you get confused, too?

954
01:07:47,193 --> 01:07:51,893
Millicent: You did
well tonight, Bobby.

955
01:07:53,808 --> 01:07:57,899
Where were you
2 months ago, Bobby?

956
01:07:57,943 --> 01:07:59,205
Be happy, Bobby.

957
01:07:59,249 --> 01:08:02,817
This is only the beginning.

958
01:08:04,950 --> 01:08:08,693
You know what you do, Bobby?

959
01:08:08,736 --> 01:08:11,565
You fuck the audience.

And now,

962
01:08:15,047 --> 01:08:18,659
you're going to fuck me.

963
01:08:22,663 --> 01:08:23,969
What's happening, Bobby?

964
01:08:24,012 --> 01:08:27,973
Have you been getting
more of those phone calls?

965
01:08:28,016 --> 01:08:29,105
Is that it?

966
01:08:29,148 --> 01:08:30,845
No.

967
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:34,458
It's all right.

968
01:08:36,068 --> 01:08:39,463
I've got it under control.

969
01:08:51,736 --> 01:08:56,132
I've got everything

Terry: Now here's
a perfect example

971
01:09:08,013 --> 01:09:09,797
of what I was telling you about.

972
01:09:09,841 --> 01:09:12,626
The Neo-realism of
the florentine school.

[Whispers] Yuk, I
don't like this picture.

Oi.

975

Notice especially
the use of perspective.

976
01:10:04,504 --> 01:10:07,942
Cheerful little
bugger, wasn't he?

977
01:10:08,943 --> 01:10:11,119
Hey, listen, I've
got half an hour.

978
01:10:11,163 --> 01:10:13,252
Let's go somewhere quiet.

979
01:10:13,296 --> 01:10:14,993
Come on.

980
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:21,913
God, I don't know what I feel.

981
01:10:21,956 --> 01:10:25,525
You know what
he was like before.

982
01:10:25,569 --> 01:10:26,613
Yeah.

983
01:10:26,657 --> 01:10:28,311
He was weird as hell,
and you knew it.

984
01:10:28,354 --> 01:10:30,835
That's why you went out
with him, remember,

985
01:10:30,878 --> 01:10:32,010
because he was exciting.

986
01:10:32,053 --> 01:10:33,316
Yeah, well, now he's different.

987
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:35,100
He's really starting
to scare me.

988
01:10:35,143 --> 01:10:36,754
Hey, slow down.

989
01:10:36,797 --> 01:10:37,624
You're tired.

990
01:10:37,668 --> 01:10:39,800
It's easy to imagine things.

991
01:10:39,844 --> 01:10:41,846
I didn't imagine the knife.

992
01:10:41,889 --> 01:10:42,803
What knife?

993
01:10:42,847 --> 01:10:44,762
He brought it back from the set.

994
01:10:44,805 --> 01:10:46,546
It's fake, but it looks so real.

995
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:49,984
He just sits there for
hours playing with it.

996
01:10:50,028 --> 01:10:51,159
It's really scary.

997
01:10:51,203 --> 01:10:54,641
And sometimes I
catch him looking at me.

998
01:10:54,685 --> 01:10:57,035
Get out of there, val.

999
01:10:57,078 --> 01:10:59,646
It's not that easy.

Yes,

1001
01:11:00,386 --> 01:11:01,518
it is.
It is easy.

1002
01:11:01,561 --> 01:11:04,172
You're just like
one of those stupid women

1003
01:11:04,216 --> 01:11:05,478
in a horror movie.

1004
01:11:05,522 --> 01:11:07,741
Whatever you do, don't
go down to the basement.

1005
01:11:07,785 --> 01:11:09,656
And immediately there you are

1006
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:12,050
in the basement
getting hacked up.

1007
01:11:12,093 --> 01:11:13,486
You're a great help.

1008
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:15,923
Well, do yourself a favor.

1009

Chuck him.

1010
01:11:17,621 --> 01:11:22,016
He's not worth the grief.

1011
01:11:23,017 --> 01:11:26,891
Do you want to stay with me?

1012
01:11:27,892 --> 01:11:30,373
I don't want to leave Bobby.

1013
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:35,987

back the way they were.

we all did very well.

1101
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,911
But now the killings
have stopped,

1102
01:19:01,954 --> 01:19:04,043
ratings going down again.

1103
01:19:04,087 --> 01:19:07,264
So you see, Bobby,
it isn't only you.

1104
01:19:07,307 --> 01:19:11,050
Looks as if we're
all going to be

1105
01:19:11,094 --> 01:19:12,269
out on the street.

1106
01:19:12,312 --> 01:19:14,010
I can't believe this.

1107
01:19:14,053 --> 01:19:15,663
There's this sicko out there,

1108
01:19:15,707 --> 01:19:22,279
and all of our jobs depend on
whether or not he keeps killing.

1109
01:19:23,367 --> 01:19:25,108
Yes.

1110
01:19:25,151 --> 01:19:29,721
We should've had him
on the payroll.

1111
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:31,201
Oughtn't we?

1112
01:19:31,549 --> 01:19:33,943
Come on, what did you expect?

1113
01:19:33,986 --> 01:19:35,118
They're always moving on,

1114
01:19:35,161 --> 01:19:36,641
looking for something different.

1115
01:19:36,684 --> 01:19:39,209
This serial killer takes a rest,

1116
01:19:39,252 --> 01:19:42,255
so let's find another one.

1117
01:19:43,082 --> 01:19:46,651
Did you think
it was about acting?

1118
01:19:46,694 --> 01:19:51,961
Like you were making some
serious dramatic point or something?

1119
01:19:52,004 --> 01:19:53,789
Jesus, Bobby, wake up.

1120
01:19:53,832 --> 01:19:55,007
You've made your point.

1121
01:19:55,051 --> 01:19:58,141
Now give it a
fucking rest, will you?

1122
01:19:58,184 --> 01:19:59,969
Why are you talking
to me like this?

1123
01:20:00,012 --> 01:20:01,274
I'm only trying to help.

1124
01:20:01,318 --> 01:20:03,276
Well, you're not!

1125
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:06,366
Look, I know it
sounds crazy, val,

1126
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:08,194
but I'm out of a job.

1127
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:09,979
He stops killing.

1128
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:12,024
I'm out of a job.

1129
01:20:12,068 --> 01:20:13,156
Isn't that sick?

1130
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:16,507
Now some freak is
chopping up pensioners

1131
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:17,682
in everhappy park,

1132
01:20:17,725 --> 01:20:20,641
and the whole circus
has moved over there.

1133
01:20:20,685 --> 01:20:25,124
It's just difficult
for me to adjust,

1134
01:20:25,168 --> 01:20:27,126
that's all.

1135
01:20:42,489 --> 01:20:44,665
I'm sorry.

1136
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,282
Hey,

1137
01:20:52,325 --> 01:20:54,806
I'm sorry.

1138
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:02,379
Come here.

1139
01:21:13,346 --> 01:21:18,177
It's been a while since
I've been this close to you

1140
01:21:18,221 --> 01:21:20,832
without killing you afterwards.

1141
01:21:33,714 --> 01:21:35,325
Will he strike again?

1142
01:21:35,368 --> 01:21:37,414
I can't tell you that.

1143
01:21:37,457 --> 01:21:39,720
All I can say is that
it's not unusual

1144
01:21:39,764 --> 01:21:42,071
for a serial killer
to suddenly erupt

1145
01:21:42,114 --> 01:21:43,855
into a spate of murders

1146
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,596
and then to resume
a normal life.

1147
01:21:45,639 --> 01:21:48,425
We hope that that is
what has happened here.

1148
01:21:48,468 --> 01:21:52,385
Jenny: Bobby mahon became
a freak TV personality

1149
01:21:52,429 --> 01:21:54,257
when he played
the stocking killer

1150
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:55,388
in crimetime.

1151
01:21:55,432 --> 01:21:57,651
In just 8 episodes of crimetime

1152
01:21:57,695 --> 01:21:59,566
he received more fan mail

1153
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:01,873
than any other TV personality.

1154
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:05,311
Well, here's what some
people on the street

1155
01:22:05,355 --> 01:22:06,791
had to say.

1156
01:22:06,834 --> 01:22:12,275
Um, we all think that
Bobby's really cute.

1157
01:22:15,626 --> 01:22:19,586
Old lady: I... I never
watch the show myself,

1158
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:21,371
but my friend does,

1159
01:22:21,414 --> 01:22:24,330
and she thinks he's dishy.

1160
01:22:39,606 --> 01:22:41,565
For god's sake sit down.

1161
01:22:41,608 --> 01:22:43,915
You're driving me crazy.

1162
01:22:50,878 --> 01:22:52,619
I feel like I'm going

1163
01:22:52,663 --> 01:22:54,665
through withdrawal symptoms.

1164
01:22:54,708 --> 01:22:55,448
What?

1165
01:22:55,492 --> 01:22:58,930
I said I feel like I'm...

1166
01:23:00,062 --> 01:23:01,019
Nothing.

1167
01:23:01,063 --> 01:23:03,282
Forget it.

1168
01:23:05,502 --> 01:23:08,635
Look, it'll be finished
in a minute,

1169
01:23:08,679 --> 01:23:10,942
and then we'll talk.

1170
01:23:34,618 --> 01:23:35,793
What's the matter?

1171
01:23:35,836 --> 01:23:39,492
You've been such
a pain all evening.

1172
01:23:39,536 --> 01:23:40,319
Sorry.

1173
01:23:40,363 --> 01:23:43,757
Look, I know how you feel.

1174
01:23:43,801 --> 01:23:45,324
Do you.

1175
01:23:45,368 --> 01:23:48,501
Do you really know how I feel?

1176
01:23:48,545 --> 01:23:50,460
Yeah, of course I do.

1177
01:23:50,503 --> 01:23:51,330
Do you?

1178
01:23:51,374 --> 01:23:53,637
Tell me then.

1179
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:55,334
Bobby.

1180
01:23:57,423 --> 01:24:00,339
Tell me how I feel.

1181
01:24:05,214 --> 01:24:07,303
I'm asking you a question.

1182
01:24:07,346 --> 01:24:10,088
Tell me how I feel.

1183
01:24:12,221 --> 01:24:15,746
I don't have to take this.

1184
01:24:15,789 --> 01:24:17,356
I'm gonna go home.

1185
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,705
See you tomorrow.

1186
01:24:18,749 --> 01:24:21,056
Bobby: Oh, that's great.

1187
01:24:21,099 --> 01:24:22,927
That's just fucking great,
isn't it?

1188
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:26,104
I need to talk,
and you wanna go home.

1189
01:24:26,148 --> 01:24:29,020
It's so easy for you,
isn't it, val?

1190
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,935
You wanna talk?

1191
01:24:30,978 --> 01:24:31,762
Well, then let's talk.

1192
01:24:31,805 --> 01:24:32,980
But you never do, do you?

1193
01:24:33,024 --> 01:24:34,697
'Cause you're always
so caught up in yourself

1194
01:24:34,721 --> 01:24:35,896
and your fucking work.

1195
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:36,723
My work is every...

1196
01:24:36,767 --> 01:24:38,116
Oh, to tell you the truth,

1197
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:39,683
I don't give a shit
about your work.

1198
01:24:39,726 --> 01:24:41,032
I'm sick to death of hearing

1199
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:45,080
how fucking wonderful
you were on crimetime.

1200
01:24:54,915 --> 01:24:56,613
Get out.

1201
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:58,919
Go on, get out.

1202
01:24:58,963 --> 01:25:02,184
Just get away from me.

1203
01:25:08,277 --> 01:25:10,844
You should see someone, Bobby.

1204
01:25:10,888 --> 01:25:12,977
You should get some help.

1205
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:14,196
Are you still here?

1206
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,981
I thought I told you to leave.

1207
01:25:17,024 --> 01:25:18,611
You're nothing special,
do you know that?

1208
01:25:18,635 --> 01:25:21,899
You're just an actor
riding on a pissy little wave.

1209
01:25:21,942 --> 01:25:22,943
Get the fuck out!

1210
01:25:22,987 --> 01:25:24,423
If it's so important to you,

1211
01:25:24,467 --> 01:25:26,686
why don't you just go and
find some poor lonely woman,

1212
01:25:26,730 --> 01:25:28,688
kill her, play yourself on TV,

1213
01:25:28,732 --> 01:25:30,603
cut out the middle man.

1214
01:25:30,647 --> 01:25:32,475
Get out!

1215
01:25:36,566 --> 01:25:38,002
I'm going.

1216
01:25:38,045 --> 01:25:41,092
God help you, Bobby.

Yes?

1222
01:26:05,072 --> 01:26:07,466
I'm sorry, Bobby.

1223
01:26:07,510 --> 01:26:09,555
Sorry I had to stop.

1224
01:26:09,599 --> 01:26:13,951
I've really messed things
up for you, haven't I?

1225
01:26:15,474 --> 01:26:20,566
Well, I felt I was getting
really close to you, Bobby.

1226
01:26:20,610 --> 01:26:22,742
It was wonderful.

1227
01:26:22,786 --> 01:26:28,618
Now I... Just feel
we're drifting apart.

1228
01:26:30,185 --> 01:26:36,669
I can't seem to see... see
myself clearly anymore.

1229
01:26:38,367 --> 01:26:41,718
You'll have to do it
for both of us now.

1230
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:47,593
You can, you know,
Bobby. You can.

1231
01:26:48,638 --> 01:26:50,814
You're ready for it.

1232
01:26:50,857 --> 01:26:55,601
I'll never be like you.

1233
01:26:57,908 --> 01:27:00,302
Well, prove it.

01:28:17,814 --> 01:28:21,121
Do you mind?
Can I join you?

1237
01:28:21,165 --> 01:28:23,428
Fuck off, creep.

1238
01:29:32,584 --> 01:29:34,412
Do you mind?

01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:38,155
Can I join you?

1240
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:41,245
Sure.

1241
01:29:41,288 --> 01:29:43,334
Why not?

1242
01:30:08,054 --> 01:30:11,493
Well, now you know
everything about me.

1243
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:14,409
Tell me about you.

1244
01:30:14,452 --> 01:30:17,803
I work for an insurance company.

1245
01:30:17,847 --> 01:30:20,458
My dad, he died.

1246
01:30:24,462 --> 01:30:26,377
I'd rather not talk about that.

1247
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:27,639
Yeah.

1248
01:30:27,683 --> 01:30:31,338
I haven't been out with
anyone for some time.

1249
01:30:32,905 --> 01:30:33,863
Are you hungry?

1250
01:30:33,906 --> 01:30:37,127
Would you like to eat something?

1251
01:30:37,170 --> 01:30:41,087
Why haven't you
been out with someone?

1252
01:30:41,131 --> 01:30:44,656
I don't really...
You know.

1253
01:30:49,531 --> 01:30:52,621
I never seem to meet anyone...

1254
01:30:52,664 --> 01:30:54,449
Suitable.

1255
01:31:03,370 --> 01:31:07,113
I guess real life
isn't like the movies.

1256
01:31:09,289 --> 01:31:12,771
All I really know is,
I was pretty...

1257
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:18,473
Well, I was pretty badly
hurt by my last girlfriend.

1258
01:31:20,910 --> 01:31:23,608
But you came here tonight.

1259
01:31:23,869 --> 01:31:28,091
I couldn't seem to stay at
home on my own anymore.

1260
01:31:31,616 --> 01:31:35,577
You know the feeling, don't you?

1261
01:31:38,449 --> 01:31:40,799
Yes...

1262
01:31:40,843 --> 01:31:42,801
I know the feeling.

1263
01:31:53,203 --> 01:31:58,948
Well, we've both been very
brave coming out tonight,

1264
01:31:58,991 --> 01:32:02,168
uh, but now it's late,

1265
01:32:02,212 --> 01:32:03,518
and I'd better be getting home

1266
01:32:03,561 --> 01:32:06,695
before I turn into
a pumpkin or something.

1267
01:32:10,916 --> 01:32:13,266
What a beautiful coat.

1268
01:32:13,832 --> 01:32:17,140
It was a bit of an extravagance,

1269
01:32:17,183 --> 01:32:19,142
but I need it.

1270
01:32:19,185 --> 01:32:21,797
I really feel the cold.

1271
01:32:28,281 --> 01:32:31,458
Are you catching the bus?

1272
01:32:31,502 --> 01:32:33,504
Yes.

1273
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:36,551
Do you want to walk me
to the bus stop?

1274
01:33:33,259 --> 01:33:36,175
Look, you'd better go now.

1275
01:33:36,219 --> 01:33:37,220
Well, ok.

1276
01:33:37,263 --> 01:33:39,352
My bus'll be here in a minute.

01:33:39,396 --> 01:33:42,965

You look pleased with yourself.

01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:21,555
Be brave, huh?

1462
01:49:21,598 --> 01:49:23,469
Do it.

1463
01:49:23,513 --> 01:49:25,254
Stick it in.

1464
01:49:25,994 --> 01:49:28,257
See what it feels like...

1465
01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:31,565
For real, huh?

1466
01:49:32,783 --> 01:49:34,306
You've wondered,
haven't you, Bobby?

1467
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:36,613
Wondered...
Lying on your bed,

1468
01:49:36,657 --> 01:49:38,963
on the set, in the
street, last night.

1469
01:49:39,007 --> 01:49:40,051
Last night!

1470
01:49:40,095 --> 01:49:41,052
Shut up.

1471
01:49:41,096 --> 01:49:42,203
You've wondered
what it feels like

1472
01:49:42,227 --> 01:49:44,447
to hear them cry, beg,
try to make deals.

1473
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:46,101
Well, it feels good, Bobby.

1474
01:49:46,144 --> 01:49:47,276
It's easy.

1475
01:49:47,319 --> 01:49:49,887
I... I don't care, Bobby.
I don't care.

1476
01:49:49,931 --> 01:49:50,888
I mean, this is it for me.

1477
01:49:50,932 --> 01:49:52,716
There's no place
for me to go now.

1478
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:54,022
No place I want to go.

1479
01:49:54,065 --> 01:49:55,066
Shut the fuck up.

1480
01:49:55,110 --> 01:49:56,435
Do you think I want
to be like you?

1481
01:49:56,459 --> 01:49:58,809
Oh, Bobby, Bobby, why
should you want to be you?

1482
01:49:58,853 --> 01:50:00,202
I'm better at being you,

1483
01:50:00,245 --> 01:50:01,788
and all the time, you
wanted to be me, didn't you?

1484
01:50:01,812 --> 01:50:04,946
You fucking
cunt-murdering bastard!

1485
01:50:04,989 --> 01:50:06,556
Look at yourself, Bobby.

1486
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:07,557
No!

1487
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:08,795
That's why you're
here, isn't it?

1488
01:50:08,819 --> 01:50:09,646
No, I...

1489
01:50:09,690 --> 01:50:11,126
Oh, let me help.

1490
01:50:11,169 --> 01:50:13,824
Bobby, Bobby.

1491
01:50:16,261 --> 01:50:20,048
Let me go...
Please?

1492
01:50:20,091 --> 01:50:22,616
Come on, Bobby...

1493
01:50:22,659 --> 01:50:25,706
Be like me.

1494
01:50:25,749 --> 01:50:27,446
It's easy.

1495
01:50:28,622 --> 01:50:30,754
It doesn't hurt.

1496
01:50:44,812 --> 01:50:45,682

1503
01:51:24,721 --> 01:51:26,897
You see, Bobby?

1504
01:51:26,941 --> 01:51:30,248
Do you see how easy it is?

1505
01:51:30,292 --> 01:51:31,728

1506
01:51:31,772 --> 01:51:35,993

1514
01:53:06,867 --> 01:53:09,434
Did you see anything?

1515
01:53:09,478 --> 01:53:13,395
Thelma: Sidney, has
your actor friend gone yet?

TV: If you did, phone
crimetimeon 0171-871...

1517

I'm sorry, but...

1518
01:53:32,457 --> 01:53:33,545
I never went up to her room.

1519
01:53:33,589 --> 01:53:35,591
After Sidney, I just left.

through this before.
