00:00:30,284 --> 00:00:34,284
www.titlovi.com

2
00:00:37,284 --> 00:00:39,912
- Can I get a table?
- Yeah, sure.

3
00:00:39,987 --> 00:00:42,046
Just we're closing soon, all right?

4
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:43,987
You're Roscoe, right?

5
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,453
Yeah, that's right.
Who's asking?

6
00:00:48,529 --> 00:00:50,929
No one.
I just heard all about you.

7
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:53,865
A real pool shark.
All those tournaments you won.

8
00:00:55,803 --> 00:00:58,135
Why don't you go to table 12,
seems like it's racked already.

9
00:00:58,205 --> 00:00:59,172
Go ahead.

10
00:01:00,374 --> 00:01:02,171
Nah. Don't worry about it.

11
00:01:02,242 --> 00:01:03,800
Just get me on the way back.

12
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:05,175
Okay.

13
00:01:05,246 --> 00:01:08,545
'Cause I am a part of you

14
00:01:09,684 --> 00:01:11,481
'Cause I live

15
00:01:11,553 --> 00:01:14,852
The life that you wanted to

16
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:19,754
You know what you swear

17
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:24,663
In air, a tribulation

18
00:01:27,035 --> 00:01:30,971
And I held you close

19
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:36,773
Gathering all your faces...

20
00:01:36,845 --> 00:01:38,938
You know, you're not bad.
I've been watching you.

21
00:01:39,014 --> 00:01:41,642
- Can you play one game?
- I had such a long day.

22
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:44,276
- I gotta get going, man.
- How about 300?

23
00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:46,377
That make you stay a little longer?

24
00:01:48,056 --> 00:01:49,387
A little longer?

25
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:53,661
It's about all it's gonna take, kid.

26
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:56,026
- Kid?
- Rack 'em up.

27
00:01:59,935 --> 00:02:04,895
# 'Cause I am a part of you

28
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,669
# 'Cause I live

29
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:10,678
# The life that you wanted to...

30
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:11,735
Not bad.

31
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,212
"Not bad"?
I just smoked you, kid.

32
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:18,480
Again with the "kid."

33
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:21,250
I only call people I like "kid."

34
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:30,490
Remember your friend Angel?

35
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:33,262
Your boy you put away?
Well, he says hello.

36
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:36,202
What do you want from me?

37
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:50,509
This way I don't forget you.

38
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,680
Make shit sure not
to forget me, douchebag.

39
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,783
This one's for me.

40
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:04,532
Rats... I got no use for them.

41
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,593
Who does?
Who does but the feds?

42
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,064
If I had it my way,

43
00:03:12,142 --> 00:03:15,043
every one of them would burn in hell.

44
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:35,759
# There is no rhyme

45
00:03:35,832 --> 00:03:38,300
# I want to watch it burn

46
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,598
# There is no reason

47
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,399
# No lesson learned

48
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,441
# Melting glass

49
00:03:44,509 --> 00:03:46,409
# Melting bone

50
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:50,914
# Bringing death
to your happy home

51
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:54,816
# I look like you,
the perfect crime

52
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:58,982
# There will be no savior
from the flame

53
00:03:59,056 --> 00:04:01,251
# I want to watch

54
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:05,455
# The world burn

55
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:08,423
# And laugh while

56
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:13,436
# I fan the flames

57
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:20,171
# I want to watch the world burn

58
00:04:21,546 --> 00:04:24,344
# And fan the flames

59
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:28,476
# With gasoline.

60
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:54,274
What a shame.

61
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:03,079
Fucking shame.

62
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:07,387
I'm sorry, Dad.
I know it hurts.

63
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:17,601
Think I'll just stick around here
for a while, okay?

64
00:05:22,574 --> 00:05:24,303
The life.

65
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:28,278
You know what I'm talking about.

66
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:31,442
Either the feds catch up to you
when you wind up behind the wall

67
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:34,418
or your own kind turns on you.

68
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:36,580
Maybe you even wind up
under the ground

69
00:05:36,656 --> 00:05:38,624
like some of these poor bastards.

70
00:05:41,828 --> 00:05:43,989
I thought it could
be different for me.

71
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:47,523
But I was wrong.

72
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,965
Dead wrong.

73
00:05:57,477 --> 00:05:59,035
Russo.

74
00:05:59,112 --> 00:06:02,047
Just watching Mr. Baldano & Sons.

75
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:05,573
Yeah. Same routine, different day.

76
00:06:07,353 --> 00:06:09,787
You gotta try and let go.

77
00:06:10,857 --> 00:06:12,916
Stop blaming yourself.

78
00:06:14,193 --> 00:06:16,093
It's not your fault.

79
00:06:17,664 --> 00:06:20,929
You did everything
you possibly could do.

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,936
With a son like that,
he's gotta be dirty.

81
00:06:24,004 --> 00:06:25,801
I can feel it in my bones.

82
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:28,171
I wanna nail that son of a bitch.

83
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:46,783
I know, Angela.

84
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,658
I know.
I know he doesn't like surprises,

85
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,824
but I got this big welcome-home dinner
planned for him at the house.

86
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,131
I just... I want things to get
off to a good start, you know?

87
00:06:56,203 --> 00:06:58,569
A new beginning for him.
It would be really nice.

88
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,375
It's just time he came
and worked for his father, okay?

89
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,419
I mean, Joseph's really got
his heart set on it this time.

90
00:07:14,188 --> 00:07:17,056
And I think Bobby could
really do all right for himself.

91
00:07:18,226 --> 00:07:19,818
Legitimately.

92
00:07:19,894 --> 00:07:22,021
What, no luggage?

93
00:07:22,097 --> 00:07:24,657
Where do you think I was,
on vacation?

94
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,792
I want nothing
from over that bridge.

95
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:28,563
Come here, you crazy bastard.

96
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:29,830
Welcome back.

97
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:31,394
We missed you.

98
00:07:43,885 --> 00:07:45,409
Where's your brother?

99
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:55,522
Bobby Baldano.

100
00:07:56,798 --> 00:07:59,528
Oh, it's good to see you,
you son of a gun.

101
00:07:59,601 --> 00:08:01,432
- How you doing, Lenny?
- Good good.

102
00:08:01,503 --> 00:08:03,266
I knew you'd make me
your first stop.

103
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:05,704
- You know that.
- You look a little thirsty.

104
00:08:05,774 --> 00:08:07,901
Let me get you a nice cold one.

105
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:10,207
- I'm gonna join you.
- Here's that.

106
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:12,280
All right.

107
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:15,249
- Salute.
- Benza salute. Chin down.

108
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,278
- Hey, Big Al, Look who's here.
- Hey, Bobby.

109
00:08:21,357 --> 00:08:23,621
- How you doing, Al?
- When you'd get out?

110
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:25,887
- This morning.
- This morning?

111
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:28,293
- You're still around?
- Hey, where am I gonna go?

112
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:30,889
That's good.
'Cause now that I'm out,

113
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:32,900
I might call on you for something.

114
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:34,458
You still got my number, right?

115
00:08:35,838 --> 00:08:38,136
Right here.

116
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:40,368
Lenny, buy him a drink.

117
00:08:40,443 --> 00:08:42,570
Get me a Captain and ginger too.

118
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:44,772
- Where's all the girls?
- Don't worry about the girls.

119
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:46,747
He's just with the boys
having a drink.

120
00:08:46,816 --> 00:08:49,148
He's gonna be here.
It's his first day. Come on.

121
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:50,810
He'll be back.

122
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,753
Wait. What are you all doing?

123
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:02,128
Let's just wait a couple of minutes
for Bobby to get home

124
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:05,259
and then we'll all eat
together like we used to.

125
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:07,599
I mean,
is that too much to ask for?

126
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:09,332
Anyways, salute again.

127
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:13,604
- Hey hey hey, look who's here.
- Good, plenty of money.

128
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:15,668
Hey, what's up?

129
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:19,177
Here come...
the broads come and you clam up.

130
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,409
Okay, but just the antipasto.

131
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:25,284
Bobby could be home
in a couple of minutes

132
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,619
and I want him
to eat the whole meal

133
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:31,218
with all of us, just like a family.

134
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:37,832
The iceman cometh. Whoa!

135
00:09:42,038 --> 00:09:45,303
I've been passing
the time, the time...

136
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,808
Somebody pass the grated cheese.

137
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,277
There you go.

138
00:09:49,346 --> 00:09:52,008
I'm here for you...

139
00:09:52,082 --> 00:09:54,482
Go, Bobby! Go, Bobby!

140
00:09:54,551 --> 00:09:59,512
# And I've been passing
the time, the time

141
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,617
# Living my life

142
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:05,821
# Waiting for you

143
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:12,867
# I've been passing
the time, the time

144
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:16,737
# Living my life

145
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:19,401
# Waiting for you

146
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:23,379
Maybe something happened.

147
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:26,041
Maybe you should go back
to Lenny's and check, Joey.

148
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,552
Hey, Sarah...

149
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:32,119
nothing happened.

150
00:10:34,892 --> 00:10:36,860
Bobby is just being Bobby.

151
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,537
Mom.

152
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:54,170
My family... I love them.

153
00:10:54,246 --> 00:10:55,713
They love me.

154
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,442
But I've disappointed 'em

155
00:10:57,516 --> 00:10:59,245
more times than I can remember.

156
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:06,681
My father...

157
00:11:10,362 --> 00:11:12,557
I know he thinks I'm a fuck-up.

158
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:18,461
What the fuck.
Maybe I am.

159
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,637
Drone!

160
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,979
Drone!

161
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,649
No! Freaking no!

162
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,762
My apartment?
In better shape than I left it.

163
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:51,702
You know my mother's
responsible for that.

164
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:03,206
Boxing.

165
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:12,356
There was a time
it was all I thought about.

166
00:12:17,397 --> 00:12:19,490
But I was too addicted
to the streets...

167
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,659
the high I got from taking
what wasn't mine.

168
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:40,713
All right, ladies, wrap it up.

169
00:12:42,956 --> 00:12:45,151
Come on.
Bang, Bobby, bang.

170
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:47,193
Baldano, that means you too.

171
00:12:48,462 --> 00:12:49,952
Fucking COs.

172
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,897
Yo, Bobby,
You gonna take care

173
00:12:52,966 --> 00:12:54,900
of that thing for me on
the outside like you said?

174
00:12:54,968 --> 00:12:56,868
You're not gonna
let me down, are you, bro?

175
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:59,997
We've been cellmates
for a long time.

176
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:03,337
I won't let you down, Angel.

177
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,173
You know how I feel about rats.

178
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:07,440
Last time I'm gonna say this...
get it moving.

179
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,911
Let's go.
Get it moving.

180
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:22,190
You gonna take care
of that thing for me

181
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:23,889
on the outside like you said?

182
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:26,057
You're not gonna
let me down, are you, bro?

183
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:27,601
Remember your friend Angel?

184
00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:30,069
Your boy you put away?
Well, he says hello.

185
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:33,707
Revenge is something that can
eat away at you like a cancer...

186
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:35,106
This way I don't forget you.

187
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:37,770
Make shit sure not
to forget me, douchebag.

188
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:38,870
...until you get it.

189
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:43,616
Your revenge.

190
00:13:43,685 --> 00:13:46,745
Then... then you can live.

191
00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:04,702
No.

192
00:14:04,773 --> 00:14:05,899
Gimme that fucking thing.

193
00:14:05,974 --> 00:14:07,100
- That fucking spaz.
- You got it.

194
00:14:07,175 --> 00:14:08,938
- I'm beating myself.
- Unbelievable.

195
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:10,307
Yeah, I'd like to beat you.

196
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,807
- I got winner.
- Ho! Fucking Bobby.

197
00:14:14,883 --> 00:14:17,443
These were my best friends, my crew.

198
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,986
Guys I could trust with my life.

199
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:21,079
Me? Look at you.
Lean and mean.

200
00:14:21,157 --> 00:14:23,057
- I can't believe what I'm seeing.
- Come here, Stan.

201
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,990
I figured I'd find
you guys at the park.

202
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,789
You think those bastards
could've put us together?

203
00:14:26,862 --> 00:14:28,295
No, they had to separate us all.

204
00:14:28,364 --> 00:14:29,888
Well, we're all here now.

205
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:31,159
What really pisses me off

206
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:33,064
is that prick Johnny writing a book.

207
00:14:33,135 --> 00:14:35,569
- You read it?
- No.

208
00:14:35,638 --> 00:14:37,765
I look at the cover every day.

209
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,468
I won't open it.
I can't bring myself to read that.

210
00:14:40,543 --> 00:14:42,238
Yeah, well,
I read the fucking thing.

211
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:44,836
Our names are
splattered all over it.

212
00:14:44,914 --> 00:14:46,745
We should go and do
this motherfucker.

213
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:48,477
Maybe one day we will.

214
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:50,485
Now that we were all out,

215
00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:52,646
all we cared about was
starting to earn again

216
00:14:52,721 --> 00:14:55,155
and maybe one day

217
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:58,022
getting back at the punks
who put us away.

218
00:15:02,431 --> 00:15:05,298
I'm telling you, that's him.

219
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:07,267
Are you sure?
Isn't he still away?

220
00:15:07,336 --> 00:15:09,964
I'm telling you,
that is Bobby Baldano.

221
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:13,031
- Who's Bobby Baldano?
- Don't worry about it.

222
00:15:14,244 --> 00:15:16,144
Why don't you girls order us
another round of drinks?

223
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:18,477
We'll be right back.
Come on, Mario.

224
00:15:18,548 --> 00:15:20,175
Let's go say hello.

225
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:22,847
Hey, man.

226
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:25,353
You Bobby Baldano, ain't you?

227
00:15:27,724 --> 00:15:30,056
I mean, come on.
You're Bobby, right? You're him?

228
00:15:30,126 --> 00:15:32,321
Hey, Ray, why don't you
do yourself a favor, huh?

229
00:15:32,395 --> 00:15:34,955
Go back to your booth,
pay some attention to your date.

230
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:37,124
- She's looking a little bored.
- Whoa. All I wanna do

231
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,361
is shake the man's hand,
buy him a drink or something.

232
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:41,461
Come on, I'm not
a fucking jerk-off here, Lenny.

233
00:15:42,806 --> 00:15:44,501
All you wanna do
is shake my hand?

234
00:15:44,574 --> 00:15:46,064
Yeah, man, that's it.

235
00:15:46,142 --> 00:15:48,372
Look, I heard a lot
of good shit about you, man.

236
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:50,504
- I've been dying to meet you.
- You're Ray, right?

237
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,706
Yeah, man.

238
00:15:51,781 --> 00:15:54,045
Oh, you met him.
You happy now?

239
00:15:54,117 --> 00:15:56,847
- Go back to your date.
- Hey, shut up, Lenny.

240
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,013
- Shut up?
- Yeah.

241
00:16:00,257 --> 00:16:01,519
Hey, yo, I read that book...

242
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:03,923
the one that talks about
you and your friends...

243
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:05,427
three times.

244
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:07,726
I read it three fucking times.

245
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:09,925
Huh? Some crazy shit.
You know what I'm talking...

246
00:16:10,001 --> 00:16:13,232
yo, we got a lot of good shit
going on ourselves.

247
00:16:13,304 --> 00:16:14,328
We're around Slick Sally.

248
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:19,072
Don't know a Slick Sally.

249
00:16:19,143 --> 00:16:21,873
Well, they used
to call him Fat Sally.

250
00:16:21,946 --> 00:16:24,005
I don't know a Fat Sally.

251
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:26,743
Come on, man.
You know him.

252
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:29,111
I said I don't know him.

253
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:31,949
Yo, Fat Sally?

254
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:33,786
Man, how could you
not know...

255
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:36,918
Oh! Hey, come on! What are you...
come on, Bobby, take it easy.

256
00:16:36,994 --> 00:16:39,224
- What the fuck? What's wrong with you?
- Have a drink.

257
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:40,855
- Let's all relax.
- Hey, what'd you go and do that f...

258
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:42,399
wait till Sally
hears about this shit.

259
00:16:42,466 --> 00:16:44,934
I don't give a fuck
what you tell Fat Sally.

260
00:16:45,002 --> 00:16:47,129
I don't care
who you're around.

261
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:48,796
To me you're a dumb fuck
with a big mouth.

262
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:52,934
Now go back over there
before you have a real problem.

263
00:16:58,482 --> 00:17:00,246
Fucking kids.

264
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:04,087
Dropping names
like fucking aspirins.

265
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,646
Yeah.

266
00:17:09,294 --> 00:17:11,353
Just one look

267
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,094
That's all it took...

268
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,330
Hey, Patsy.

269
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:20,837
Oh, ain't this my lucky day?

270
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,498
Look who came to see Patsy.

271
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:25,065
So you got a few more
under your belt, huh?

272
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:26,667
Hey, it is what it is.

273
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,679
We all gotta do some time
sooner or later

274
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,977
to keep this thing of ours alive.

275
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:32,346
Lemme ask you something...

276
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:34,351
what happened
at Leone's the other night?

277
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,182
Why'd you slap
that kid Ray in the face?

278
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:37,846
He told you he was
with Slick Sally.

279
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,515
Who the hell is Slick Sally?

280
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,252
Don't play stupid with me, Bobby.

281
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,794
The kid told you he was
talking about Fat Sally.

282
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,990
Fat Sally and Slick Sally
are the same guy.

283
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:50,364
He had that rubber-band operation
or whatever the fuck you call it

284
00:17:50,435 --> 00:17:52,369
when they try
to lose weight right away.

285
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:55,305
The point is he ain't
so fat anymore.

286
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:58,139
I think the kid had a big mouth,
dropping his name like that, Patsy.

287
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,008
Ray is like
a kid brother to Sally.

288
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,173
Sally took him under his wing,
just like Tommy did with you.

289
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,877
Sally's a captain now.
You'd better get used to this, Bobby.

290
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,284
- You're kidding me.
- He's Teddy Vesca's son,

291
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,686
and he's in the kitchen, so...

292
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,549
Well, he ain't nothing
like his father. You know that.

293
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,857
You're talking
about a skipper, Bobby.

294
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,056
That's enough.
I don't wanna hear anymore.

295
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:21,362
And you're gonna
have to report to him.

296
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,834
- He's your captain. That's it.
- All right, Patsy.

297
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,736
- Whatever you say.
- Carmine!

298
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:34,376
Sally, he wants to see ya.

299
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:37,644
It's Slick Sally now, Carmine,

300
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,514
not just "Sally."

301
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,385
How many times I gotta
tell these fucking guys?

302
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:49,557
Don't go nowhere.
Watch this sauce.

303
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,927
Sure, no problem.

304
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:00,598
- What's up, P?
- Sally, have a seat.

305
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,739
Sorry about your boy there.

306
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:07,542
- Just a little misunderstanding.
- Yeah, right.

307
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:10,606
So what are we gonna do
about this, Patsy?

308
00:19:10,684 --> 00:19:13,881
Come on. This kid just got
outta the can. He's feeling antsy.

309
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:16,923
You guys need
to put this behind you.

310
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,116
Let's move on, okay?

311
00:19:19,193 --> 00:19:22,424
All right.
Whatever you say, P.

312
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,099
We were gonna go down the block
to get a couple of heroes

313
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,263
from Jon's Deli
while the sauce cooked.

314
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:33,931
I'm too hungry.
I can't wait.

315
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,635
You know what?
I'll take a walk with you, Sally.

316
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,905
Now that's a good idea.

317
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:41,073
Why don't you do that?
You guys go take a walk.

318
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:43,617
- But I was gonna drive.
- Drive?

319
00:19:43,685 --> 00:19:45,277
It's a fucking block away.

320
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:46,479
Walk.

321
00:19:50,492 --> 00:19:53,052
You know, that kid Ray is
like a younger brother to me.

322
00:19:53,128 --> 00:19:55,653
You really
embarrassed him, Bobby.

323
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,722
I think he embarrassed himself,
dropping your name like that.

324
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,825
I mean, don't you think
he should've known better

325
00:20:00,902 --> 00:20:02,927
with the feds all over the place
in this neighborhood?

326
00:20:04,472 --> 00:20:07,339
Don't gimme that shit, Bobby, okay?

327
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:08,966
I know you never liked me.

328
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:10,840
You're lucky you only smacked him,

329
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:13,403
because otherwise there would've been
some real consequences.

330
00:20:13,481 --> 00:20:15,312
Really?

331
00:20:15,383 --> 00:20:17,351
Like what kind of consequences?

332
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:25,154
Let's just go get the heroes.

333
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:26,955
No, I'd really like
to know what kind

334
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:29,929
of consequences we're
talking about here, Sally.

335
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:32,490
Look, I'm a fucking
captain now, Bobby.

336
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:34,968
Do you know what that means?

337
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:37,972
Or do I have to spell it out for you?

338
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,837
Well, I know
what it don't mean...

339
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:42,434
it don't mean shit,
not in this alley.

340
00:20:46,081 --> 00:20:47,844
Did that hurt, Fat Sally?

341
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:51,648
Oh, I forget...
it's Slick Sally now, right?

342
00:20:52,788 --> 00:20:54,517
Captain?

343
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,388
You may have Patsy fooled,
but I know what you're made of.

344
00:20:57,459 --> 00:20:59,723
If you breathe
a word of this to him,

345
00:20:59,795 --> 00:21:02,355
you're a dead man.
Better yet,

346
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:04,365
I'll tell him
you called Patsy "the pirate"

347
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:05,559
- behind his back.
- No.

348
00:21:05,634 --> 00:21:06,726
He'd shoot you himself.

349
00:21:06,802 --> 00:21:11,136
No. No, please don't, Bobby.
Please.

350
00:21:16,912 --> 00:21:19,642
- Please.
- You gotta be kidding me.

351
00:21:19,715 --> 00:21:21,740
You believe that shit?

352
00:21:22,818 --> 00:21:24,046
A captain...

353
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,179
a fucking captain

354
00:21:26,256 --> 00:21:27,848
pissing his pants.

355
00:21:27,924 --> 00:21:29,585
Well, I don't know
why things changed,

356
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:31,320
but here's the real deal

357
00:21:31,394 --> 00:21:33,624
about this overrated
underworld life.

358
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:38,559
As a federal agent,

359
00:21:38,635 --> 00:21:40,660
I've been watching
the mob since day one,

360
00:21:40,737 --> 00:21:42,398
so I was right in the heart of things

361
00:21:42,472 --> 00:21:44,201
when Bobby Baldano crossed over.

362
00:21:44,274 --> 00:21:47,539
got straightened out,
got his badge.

363
00:21:51,514 --> 00:21:53,379
He was the youngest guy
to ever get made

364
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,747
in the Carana family.

365
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:56,285
By his late 20s,

366
00:21:56,353 --> 00:21:58,218
he had established himself
as an earner

367
00:21:58,288 --> 00:22:01,121
and a loyal soldier
amongst a dying breed.

368
00:22:01,191 --> 00:22:02,852
He learned from the best...

369
00:22:02,926 --> 00:22:05,087
and the worst,
if you know what I mean.

370
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,957
Tommy Bono...

371
00:22:09,032 --> 00:22:11,262
he was the underboss
of the family at the time.

372
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:13,632
He kinda took Bobby
under his wing.

373
00:22:13,703 --> 00:22:15,603
Tommy was old school

374
00:22:15,672 --> 00:22:17,537
and all about business.

375
00:22:17,607 --> 00:22:20,975
He was likeable.
People liked Tommy.

376
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:22,808
Didn't have many enemies.

377
00:22:24,782 --> 00:22:27,683
That was the boss...
Vinny Morello.

378
00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:31,751
Vinny was a good guy,

379
00:22:31,822 --> 00:22:33,119
but I can't say
the same for his son.

380
00:22:35,192 --> 00:22:37,558
You all know why you're here.

381
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:40,927
This is the biggest honor
you can have in this life.

382
00:22:42,466 --> 00:22:44,434
You will now be a part of us.

383
00:22:46,404 --> 00:22:47,962
You all know the rules.

384
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:51,975
If called upon,
you will drop everything.

385
00:22:52,043 --> 00:22:54,409
We are your family.

386
00:22:54,478 --> 00:22:56,810
We come before anything,

387
00:22:56,881 --> 00:22:58,508
even your own family.

388
00:23:20,105 --> 00:23:24,041
May you burn in hell
if you deceive anyone in this family.

389
00:23:26,178 --> 00:23:28,476
These guys took themselves
very seriously.

390
00:23:28,547 --> 00:23:32,108
...or talk about the secrets
of our lives in any shape or form...

391
00:23:32,184 --> 00:23:34,482
And we were very serious
about bringing them down...

392
00:23:34,553 --> 00:23:36,987
...my soul will burn in hell.

393
00:23:37,055 --> 00:23:39,888
...one way or another.

394
00:23:41,226 --> 00:23:43,217
You're all now a part of us...

395
00:23:43,295 --> 00:23:44,819
la familia.

396
00:24:05,785 --> 00:24:07,685
What I don't get

397
00:24:07,754 --> 00:24:09,722
is there are some guys
who go into this life

398
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:13,885
knowing if they get caught
they're gonna rat.

399
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,396
They just know it.
They're like, "What the fuck?

400
00:24:17,463 --> 00:24:19,556
Let me do this as long as I can.

401
00:24:19,632 --> 00:24:21,600
If I get caught,

402
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:24,761
I bring down whoever
I have to to get off."

403
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:26,668
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's get this over with.

404
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:28,730
I have a haircut appointment.
I'd really like to make it.

405
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:30,036
You and your fucking haircuts, Stan.

406
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:31,872
You've got a weird-shaped head.

407
00:24:31,944 --> 00:24:33,536
Maybe you should grow
your hair longer to hide that.

408
00:24:33,613 --> 00:24:35,274
Plus, with this shnozole,
maybe longer hair

409
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,111
would make it look smaller
or something.

410
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:39,242
You're very funny, Jimmy.
You should take that on the road.

411
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:41,115
Let's do this, Jimmy.

412
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:43,913
All right, everybody freeze!

413
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:47,585
You, fill this bag up!
Fill it up! Fill it up!

414
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,594
- On the ground! Pronto!
- Quickly!

415
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:51,527
Pick up the pace!
Don't touch the alarm!

416
00:24:51,597 --> 00:24:53,565
- Come on, move it!
- Quickly. Let's go. Quickly.

417
00:24:53,633 --> 00:24:56,067
Get the money, let's go!
Get the money!

418
00:24:56,135 --> 00:24:57,626
You too!
Quickly. Now!

419
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,901
Quickly! Move!
Move your ass!

420
00:25:00,974 --> 00:25:03,602
Don't touch the alarm.
Don't touch the alarm.

421
00:25:03,677 --> 00:25:05,645
All right, we're outta here.
Have a nice day.

422
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,077
That's the way we did things...

423
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:08,808
one, two, three.

424
00:25:10,517 --> 00:25:12,109
Jobs were like a joke to us.

425
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,554
We actually had fun doing that.

426
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,919
You're like a little girl.
You know that?

427
00:25:19,993 --> 00:25:22,154
What? It's not like
they make 'em easy to open.

428
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:24,595
Just give me this
fucking thing, will ya?

429
00:25:24,665 --> 00:25:27,429
These guys used to rip 'em
right out of the ground.

430
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:29,935
But of course,
no one ever saw them...

431
00:25:31,505 --> 00:25:33,405
so they weren't
an easy bunch to nail.

432
00:25:33,474 --> 00:25:34,941
Jackpot.

433
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:43,639
We made our scores,
kept our mouths shut,

434
00:25:43,717 --> 00:25:45,275
and minded our own business.

435
00:25:45,352 --> 00:25:47,946
We didn't want
to draw attention to ourselves.

436
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:50,080
We didn't care
about impressing anyone.

437
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:53,616
On the other hand,
not everyone was like us.

438
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,296
There's Johnny Morello and his crew.

439
00:26:06,374 --> 00:26:08,842
Hey, girls, if you're good,

440
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,605
I'll take you
for a ride in my Caddy.

441
00:26:10,678 --> 00:26:13,340
That's right. Huh?

442
00:26:13,414 --> 00:26:15,439
That's Mario Bruno,

443
00:26:15,517 --> 00:26:18,315
also known as Mario Casanova.

444
00:26:19,487 --> 00:26:20,886
What, you don't like Caddies?

445
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:23,389
He thought he was
God's gift to women.

446
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:24,948
You know what? Go.

447
00:26:25,026 --> 00:26:26,618
But I heard he couldn't
even get it up.

448
00:26:26,694 --> 00:26:28,355
- Get the fuck outta here.
- Fuck you.

449
00:26:29,597 --> 00:26:31,997
Call us when you get a real car.

450
00:26:32,066 --> 00:26:34,034
- Come on.
- Assholes.

451
00:26:34,102 --> 00:26:37,230
What did you do that for, Mario?
Those girls were hot.

452
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:40,001
And Mikey, a real punk,

453
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:41,336
a real wannabe.

454
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:44,345
Ah, they were pigs.
They're all pigs.

455
00:26:44,413 --> 00:26:47,246
Come on, let's go gambling.

456
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:50,682
Baldano and his crew,

457
00:26:50,753 --> 00:26:52,414
they were low profile...

458
00:26:52,488 --> 00:26:54,979
not the norm at the time.

459
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:58,549
But you could always find
these guys flaunting their stuff.

460
00:26:58,627 --> 00:27:00,219
I mean look at this,

461
00:27:00,296 --> 00:27:03,732
putting it out there like that?

462
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:06,233
These guys weren't very bright.

463
00:27:06,302 --> 00:27:07,963
Almost makes you laugh.

464
00:27:09,071 --> 00:27:10,436
How low can you go?

465
00:27:40,637 --> 00:27:42,127
In spite of them,

466
00:27:42,205 --> 00:27:44,230
it was all going well for us.

467
00:27:44,307 --> 00:27:46,537
We had things under control.

468
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,773
We were keeping a safe distance away
from those morons.

469
00:27:49,846 --> 00:27:52,371
- and we were making damn good money.
- Here you go.

470
00:27:52,449 --> 00:27:55,213
We were planning a score
that would hold us over for years.

471
00:27:55,285 --> 00:27:58,220
- No polish on the socks.
- A really big score.

472
00:27:58,288 --> 00:28:00,415
- Give it a good shine there.
- It was gonna be our thing...

473
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,481
- Good, kid.
- Hey, Pete.

474
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,992
- Hey, Bobby.
- ...or so we thought.

475
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,925
- Hey, Tommy.
- Hey.

476
00:28:05,996 --> 00:28:08,988
- You wanted to see me?
- Hey, hello, Bobby. Yeah, I do.

477
00:28:09,065 --> 00:28:11,590
Hold on one second.
Hey, kid, hold on a second.

478
00:28:11,668 --> 00:28:14,398
Hold on.
Go get us a couple of coffees.

479
00:28:14,471 --> 00:28:16,462
- You know how I drink 'em, right?
- Uh-huh.

480
00:28:16,539 --> 00:28:18,837
Here. And buy yourself
a Yoo-hoo or something,

481
00:28:18,908 --> 00:28:20,899
- a soda. I take change.
- Okay.

482
00:28:20,977 --> 00:28:22,808
- And don't forget.
- Okay.

483
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:27,641
Hey, Bobby,

484
00:28:27,717 --> 00:28:30,448
you've been earning
pretty good out there lately.

485
00:28:30,521 --> 00:28:32,455
I'm very proud of you.

486
00:28:32,523 --> 00:28:35,321
And we all know that you've got
something big planned,

487
00:28:35,393 --> 00:28:38,521
so Vinny would like for you

488
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:42,191
to bring his son and his crew
with you on this one,

489
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:45,167
- you know, just for backup.
- Actually, Tommy...

490
00:28:45,236 --> 00:28:46,669
no disrespect to Mr. Morello...

491
00:28:46,737 --> 00:28:48,500
we've pretty much got things covered.

492
00:28:48,572 --> 00:28:50,233
We don't need any backup.

493
00:28:51,409 --> 00:28:52,808
Extra guys on this job

494
00:28:52,877 --> 00:28:54,344
just make it that much riskier.

495
00:28:54,412 --> 00:28:56,437
Riskier?
I'm offering you backup.

496
00:28:56,514 --> 00:28:58,175
It's just that... I mean

497
00:28:58,249 --> 00:29:00,683
you know what you're
dealing with with these guys.

498
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:03,515
Hey, listen, I know what you're
talking about. They're screw-ups,

499
00:29:03,587 --> 00:29:07,023
but he's the boss's son.
You have no choice.

500
00:29:09,593 --> 00:29:12,323
He should be here any minute.
Put your masks on.

501
00:29:12,396 --> 00:29:14,057
I don't want any chance
of getting made.

502
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:17,733
Hey, what did I say?
Put your mask on.

503
00:29:17,802 --> 00:29:19,736
- All right.
- Don't fuck this up, huh?

504
00:29:19,804 --> 00:29:21,237
Okay, take it easy.

505
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,738
Here he comes now.

506
00:29:38,156 --> 00:29:39,555
Mr. Klein?

507
00:29:39,624 --> 00:29:42,354
I have a delivery
for an Eleanor Klein.

508
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:43,689
It's kinda heavy.

509
00:29:43,762 --> 00:29:45,889
Yeah, that's my wife...

510
00:29:45,964 --> 00:29:47,989
always spending.

511
00:29:48,066 --> 00:29:49,727
Can you bring it in here for me?

512
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:51,393
Yeah, sure, no problem.

513
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,938
Whoa whoa.
What's going on?

514
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:55,199
Stay there!

515
00:29:55,273 --> 00:29:56,535
- Okay. Okay.
- Don't move!

516
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,939
Okay, hotshot,
where's the safe?

517
00:29:58,009 --> 00:29:59,738
- Take us to the safe. Let's go.
- The safe.

518
00:30:02,848 --> 00:30:04,577
Let's go, you fuck!

519
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:06,844
- Okay okay.
- Let's go, let's go.

520
00:30:06,918 --> 00:30:09,716
- Up the stairs. Come on, let's go!
- All right, don't push.

521
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:10,982
Go on.
That's it, go on!

522
00:30:24,937 --> 00:30:27,963
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy this.

523
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,406
What are you talking
about "enjoy," huh?

524
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:32,569
Hey, don't fuck up.
Don't fuck around.

525
00:30:32,645 --> 00:30:35,409
- Remember what they said.
- Take it easy.

526
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:38,641
Gotta take the rock, sweetheart,

527
00:30:38,718 --> 00:30:40,652
but I left you the band, okay?

528
00:30:41,788 --> 00:30:44,222
Man, how's a guy like that

529
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,689
get a broad like you?

530
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:48,586
Oh, lemme guess...

531
00:30:48,661 --> 00:30:50,492
unlimited access

532
00:30:50,563 --> 00:30:53,896
to those shiny little rocks of his, huh?

533
00:30:53,966 --> 00:30:56,594
I bet you he even paid
for those two beauties.

534
00:30:56,669 --> 00:30:59,229
What are you doing? What are
you doing? I said cut that shit out.

535
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:03,071
- C'mon! Stop that. Cut that shit out.
- Fuck those guys.

536
00:31:03,142 --> 00:31:07,670
You're real tough with that gun in
your hand and that mask on your face.

537
00:31:07,747 --> 00:31:11,115
Are you so ugly you're afraid
to show your face?

538
00:31:13,153 --> 00:31:14,381
Ugly?

539
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:18,523
- Me?
- Yeah.

540
00:31:18,592 --> 00:31:21,083
You know
what they call me?

541
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:23,755
They call me
Mario Casanova, baby.

542
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:25,924
What are you doing?
What is the matter with you?

543
00:31:25,999 --> 00:31:27,864
You just told her your name.

544
00:31:27,935 --> 00:31:30,495
Oh shit.
I'm sorry, Johnny.

545
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:33,802
Shit.
Now we're fucked.

546
00:31:36,844 --> 00:31:38,311
Sorry, baby. I gotta do this.

547
00:31:38,378 --> 00:31:40,278
- Let's go, let's go!
- The fuck are you doing?!

548
00:31:40,347 --> 00:31:41,939
You heard what he said...
out the door!

549
00:31:42,015 --> 00:31:43,482
- What is this?
- It's her ring.

550
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:45,381
Gimme this fucking thing.
Come on, get out.

551
00:31:45,452 --> 00:31:47,852
- Don't move!
- Barry!

552
00:31:49,022 --> 00:31:50,717
Barry, come down!

553
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:55,051
Barry! Barry, I'm...

554
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,664
Wow. Beautiful.

555
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:03,465
That is a lot of glass.
What do you think, Stan?

556
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:06,468
These are some serious stones.

557
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:09,066
My guy's all ready for 'em.
You just say the word.

558
00:32:12,547 --> 00:32:15,175
We'll get this sold, have your money
for you within a week.

559
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,741
Beautiful.
Great doing business with ya.

560
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:22,551
Yeah, for the first and last time.

561
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:24,751
What? What the hell
you talking about,

562
00:32:24,826 --> 00:32:26,555
"first and last time"?
Come on.

563
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:28,357
- We've got a good thing going on.
- We do.

564
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:30,021
- You don't wanna ruin it.
- Definitely, Mario.

565
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,935
- Bobby, what the fuck?
- He got what he deserved.

566
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:36,732
Next time tell him
to leave his dick at home

567
00:32:36,804 --> 00:32:38,772
- before he goes on a job.
- Bobby, you can't be serious.

568
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:41,240
Are you kidding me? I think
you're a little bit out of line here.

569
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:44,437
- Out of line?
- Johnny, let it go.

570
00:32:44,512 --> 00:32:46,742
Hey, guys,
we made the score, right?

571
00:32:46,814 --> 00:32:49,715
You guys are gonna get every dime
you got coming to you next week.

572
00:32:49,784 --> 00:32:52,014
Besides, Johnny,
if your father heard

573
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:54,145
about how this jerk-off
handled himself in there,

574
00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:57,454
he would have his ass.

575
00:32:57,526 --> 00:32:59,460
And probably yours, too,
for bringing him along.

576
00:32:59,528 --> 00:33:02,019
I think that you should probably

577
00:33:02,097 --> 00:33:04,190
just forget about
this little incident and move on.

578
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:06,131
- I ain't forgetting shit, Jimmy!
- Mario, shut up.

579
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:08,226
- Shut up! Shut up.
- Fuck you, Bobby!

580
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:12,530
Bobby, Jimmy,
I'll talk to you guys next week.

581
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:15,304
That's how you handle
punks like that.

582
00:33:15,377 --> 00:33:17,470
Al, make sure they leave.

583
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:20,208
Of course we had
to pay tribute to the boss,

584
00:33:20,282 --> 00:33:22,648
- Vinny Morello, and Tommy.
- He had it coming.

585
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:25,152
Splitting the rest of take
with those assholes

586
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,744
didn't sit too well with us.

587
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:29,217
Enough time had gone by

588
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:31,486
for these two morons
to mess up big time.

589
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,461
They were selling cocaine
behind the boss's back.

590
00:33:35,798 --> 00:33:37,288
The best part?

591
00:33:37,366 --> 00:33:39,334
Their biggest customer...

592
00:33:40,469 --> 00:33:41,834
was one of us.

593
00:33:43,572 --> 00:33:45,733
Do you realize you're looking
at 20 years, Bruno?

594
00:33:45,808 --> 00:33:48,642
20 fucking years.

595
00:33:48,712 --> 00:33:51,681
Mario starts crying
when the feds tell him

596
00:33:51,748 --> 00:33:55,184
he's looking at 20. Crying!

597
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:58,478
It only took this reject

598
00:33:58,555 --> 00:34:00,318
a few minutes to start yapping.

599
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,688
Ah. My favorite.
It gives me energy.

600
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:05,091
- But once he started...
- So like I was saying...

601
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:06,628
...you couldn't stop him.

602
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,633
- FBI! FBI!
- What the fuck?!

603
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:17,536
- Freeze!
- Don't even think about it, Johnny.

604
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:19,370
All right, all right.
Don't shoot.

605
00:34:19,442 --> 00:34:23,811
What? What? What do
you guys want from me? Huh?

606
00:34:24,914 --> 00:34:26,677
What do you guys wanna know?

607
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,843
Nabbing those punks helped us

608
00:34:28,918 --> 00:34:30,715
get close to who
we really wanted...

609
00:34:30,787 --> 00:34:32,982
Vinny Morello and Tommy Bono.

610
00:34:33,056 --> 00:34:35,024
What do you guys
want me to do, huh?

611
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:37,457
Hmm? You want me
to cooperate, I'll cooperate.

612
00:34:37,527 --> 00:34:40,189
Just... you guys gotta
cut me a deal though.

613
00:34:41,631 --> 00:34:43,156
Just cut me a deal.

614
00:34:47,738 --> 00:34:51,196
Paulo, don't take too much off
like you did the last time.

615
00:34:51,275 --> 00:34:53,300
Yeah, a little bit...
a little bit off the back.

616
00:34:55,946 --> 00:34:58,642
They could've threatened us
with the electric chair.

617
00:34:58,716 --> 00:35:00,479
None of us would've flipped.

618
00:35:00,551 --> 00:35:02,917
They were just dying
for one of us to turn

619
00:35:02,987 --> 00:35:04,887
on Vinny Morella and Tommy Bono.

620
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:09,154
Well, Johnny took care of that.

621
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:10,693
# In the middle too...

622
00:35:12,396 --> 00:35:15,229
# If you keep it up now, darling...

623
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:19,065
# It'll be the death of you

624
00:35:19,136 --> 00:35:22,196
# You'd better wise up

625
00:35:22,273 --> 00:35:24,969
# Listen to your priest

626
00:35:26,277 --> 00:35:27,904
# If you don't change...

627
00:35:27,978 --> 00:35:31,470
- Shit.
- Shit.

628
00:35:33,184 --> 00:35:35,415
Just like I said,

629
00:35:35,487 --> 00:35:38,251
there are people who go into this
knowing if they get caught...

630
00:35:40,025 --> 00:35:41,959
they're gonna say
what they gotta say

631
00:35:42,027 --> 00:35:44,257
and sign what they gotta sign

632
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:47,127
until they cut themselves a deal.

633
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,895
# Circle up the wagons

634
00:35:51,169 --> 00:35:54,366
# Dark circles under your eyes

635
00:35:54,439 --> 00:35:56,907
# The buzzards are circling

636
00:35:58,176 --> 00:36:00,440
# Waiting for their prize.

637
00:36:14,726 --> 00:36:16,921
They gave Tommy 18 years.

638
00:36:16,995 --> 00:36:20,123
He died when he was
barely into his sentence.

639
00:36:20,198 --> 00:36:21,961
He got cancer that was treatable.

640
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:24,433
Nurse. Nurse.

641
00:36:24,503 --> 00:36:27,563
- Just like Tommy said...
- Water.

642
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:29,631
...when you get sick in prison,
you're done.

643
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:32,269
- Water.
- They made him suffer.

644
00:36:32,345 --> 00:36:35,314
Water. Water.

645
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:47,120
# I'll never be the same again

646
00:36:47,193 --> 00:36:50,356
# That's for certain

647
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:53,262
# Broken up and hollowed out...
- Lenny.

648
00:36:53,332 --> 00:36:56,165
- Yeah?
- Who's that girl?

649
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:59,204
Oh, her name is Rena.
She's a neighborhood girl.

650
00:37:02,542 --> 00:37:05,375
She was here the night
you smacked that punk Ray.

651
00:37:05,444 --> 00:37:08,174
So what did you tell her about me?

652
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:09,680
Nothing.
What was I gonna tell her?

653
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:12,950
She's pretty hot.

654
00:37:13,019 --> 00:37:14,509
Nah, she's not pretty hot.

655
00:37:14,587 --> 00:37:16,885
She's smoking hot.

656
00:37:16,956 --> 00:37:18,719
Send over a drink.

657
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:20,315
All right.

658
00:37:22,729 --> 00:37:26,495
The gentleman would like
to buy you two lovely ladies a drink.

659
00:37:26,567 --> 00:37:28,057
Thanks, Lenny.

660
00:37:28,135 --> 00:37:29,727
You got it, Rena.

661
00:37:31,939 --> 00:37:34,032
Do your thing, Casanova.

662
00:37:35,275 --> 00:37:36,708
Come on, chop chop.

663
00:37:38,979 --> 00:37:40,310
He's coming over.

664
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,280
I think I'm gonna go
to the ladies room.

665
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:51,684
- Thanks for the drink.
- Hey, no problem.

666
00:37:51,758 --> 00:37:54,318
- So what's your name?
- Come on.

667
00:37:54,394 --> 00:37:55,884
You already know my name.

668
00:37:55,963 --> 00:37:58,830
What, did Lenny rat me out?

669
00:37:58,899 --> 00:38:02,494
- So you know my name too?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

670
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:06,369
- Rena. It's a real nice name.
- Thanks.

671
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,499
You know, last time I was here,

672
00:38:08,575 --> 00:38:10,202
I saw you smack Ray.

673
00:38:12,279 --> 00:38:15,272
- He was pretty embarrassed.
- Well, he deserved it.

674
00:38:16,951 --> 00:38:18,441
What are you,
some kind of tough guy?

675
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:20,316
Come on, cut it out.

676
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,091
- You like cars?
- Cars?

677
00:38:30,598 --> 00:38:33,965
# Still blue water

678
00:38:34,035 --> 00:38:37,471
# Still blue water

679
00:38:37,538 --> 00:38:40,769
# Roll over me, over me

680
00:38:40,842 --> 00:38:44,278
# Still blue water

681
00:38:44,345 --> 00:38:45,937
# Still blue water...

682
00:38:46,014 --> 00:38:48,847
Hey, mister, peel out!

683
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:54,511
Wow!

684
00:38:58,626 --> 00:39:00,651
Give us a little more time
and I just might

685
00:39:00,728 --> 00:39:02,821
be willing to help you
break that dry streak.

686
00:39:02,897 --> 00:39:05,957
Trust me,
it'll be worth the wait.

687
00:39:31,727 --> 00:39:33,388
I can't take it.

688
00:39:44,373 --> 00:39:45,840
Prison.

689
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,442
These guys go in dysfunctional

690
00:39:50,512 --> 00:39:52,537
and they come out worse.

691
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:12,096
Joey, how long I know you?

692
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:14,726
All my life, right?

693
00:40:16,973 --> 00:40:18,838
So I'm gonna be
honest with you.

694
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:24,172
What are you gonna do
about your son Bobby?

695
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:26,078
Always getting in trouble.

696
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:29,550
How many times you gonna stick
your neck out for this kid, huh?

697
00:40:34,424 --> 00:40:36,483
You built a name up for yourself.

698
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,424
You got yourself an empire

699
00:40:38,495 --> 00:40:40,463
and he's gonna fuck it up big time.

700
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:45,124
He goes back,
they're gonna throw away the keys.

701
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,101
I'm glad I'm not in your shoes...

702
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,908
kid like that.

703
00:40:52,976 --> 00:40:55,707
All I'm saying, Joey,
if he's gonna listen to anybody,

704
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,213
he's gonna listen to you.

705
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:00,713
You hear me?
You're the only one

706
00:41:00,785 --> 00:41:02,184
he's gonna listen to.

707
00:41:04,288 --> 00:41:07,746
No, but my love is singing.
It's what I wanna do.

708
00:41:07,825 --> 00:41:11,261
Unfortunately, I do work
as a cocktail waitress for now.

709
00:41:11,328 --> 00:41:13,796
But singing is what I wanna do.

710
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:15,456
I never met a chick
who sang before.

711
00:41:15,533 --> 00:41:18,297
- Chick?
- Well...

712
00:41:18,369 --> 00:41:19,631
you know what I mean.

713
00:41:21,472 --> 00:41:23,963
But since you asked,
I've been singing

714
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:25,941
since I was a kid.
I studied for years.

715
00:41:28,145 --> 00:41:31,774
What about you?
What were you in for?

716
00:41:33,517 --> 00:41:34,779
What are you gonna do now?

717
00:41:35,853 --> 00:41:38,413
I heard your father's
a construction bigwig.

718
00:41:38,489 --> 00:41:40,013
You gonna go work for him?

719
00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:53,602
I'm telling you I've been watching
the guy all morning.

720
00:41:53,672 --> 00:41:55,606
It's like he don't even care.

721
00:41:55,674 --> 00:41:57,335
The fucking balls on this guy.

722
00:41:57,409 --> 00:41:59,434
Well, if I gotta come down there

723
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:01,172
and make my presence known,
that's what I'm gonna do.

724
00:42:01,246 --> 00:42:03,111
Glenn, I'm not paying $55 an hour

725
00:42:03,181 --> 00:42:06,014
so this clown can go sell
high school students drugs!

726
00:42:12,257 --> 00:42:14,817
Hey, how long we known
each other, Glenn?

727
00:42:14,893 --> 00:42:17,361
No, 34 years to be exact.

728
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,322
Why is it... isn't it redundant

729
00:42:20,398 --> 00:42:22,263
I have to send
three required letters

730
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:23,824
to your union now?
That's right!

731
00:42:23,902 --> 00:42:25,699
High school students,
that's correct.

732
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,203
I wanna tell you something.

733
00:42:27,272 --> 00:42:30,002
If he's not off my site
by 6:.00 Monday morning,

734
00:42:30,075 --> 00:42:31,872
put on a nice suit.

735
00:42:31,943 --> 00:42:34,844
'Cause you're gonna be
on the 6:.00 news Monday night.

736
00:42:49,095 --> 00:42:50,824
Hi honey.

737
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:54,361
Hi.

738
00:42:56,936 --> 00:42:59,029
What's wrong, Joseph?

739
00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:04,973
10:00. You haven't
even had any dinner.

740
00:43:06,612 --> 00:43:07,909
I brought you some.

741
00:43:11,651 --> 00:43:13,585
I'm not even hungry.

742
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:20,859
What is it, Joseph?

743
00:43:20,927 --> 00:43:22,861
You haven't been yourself.

744
00:43:27,567 --> 00:43:28,898
Well, it's Bobby.

745
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,638
I know what you want for him.

746
00:43:34,074 --> 00:43:36,838
I know what I want for him.

747
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:40,073
But I just can't figure out
what Bobby wants for himself.

748
00:43:48,422 --> 00:43:50,788
Now that's the only way
to erect a crane, Danny.

749
00:43:50,857 --> 00:43:52,882
Just know it's appreciated.

750
00:43:55,696 --> 00:43:57,186
- Bobby, how you doing?
- Hey, guys.

751
00:43:57,264 --> 00:43:58,697
Hey, Bobby, welcome home.

752
00:43:58,765 --> 00:44:00,130
How's it going?

753
00:44:03,337 --> 00:44:05,635
Hey, Bobby.

754
00:44:07,774 --> 00:44:09,401
You decide to take the plunge?

755
00:44:09,476 --> 00:44:12,104
- What plunge?
- Come on.

756
00:44:12,179 --> 00:44:13,612
Play stupid with me.

757
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,341
You know what I'm talking about.

758
00:44:16,883 --> 00:44:19,113
You should be at work
here with me right now.

759
00:44:19,186 --> 00:44:21,780
Come on.
I'll sponsor you right now.

760
00:44:21,855 --> 00:44:23,823
I'll get your book.

761
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:26,826
Be a shop steward, project manager,
super... whatever you wish.

762
00:44:26,894 --> 00:44:28,987
Better yet, work by my side

763
00:44:29,063 --> 00:44:32,157
- at the company, from the office.
- I don't know, Dad.

764
00:44:32,233 --> 00:44:33,564
Why not?

765
00:44:33,635 --> 00:44:35,626
I've got some other things
in the works.

766
00:44:35,703 --> 00:44:38,604
- You know I like to do my own thing.
- Your own thing, huh?

767
00:44:43,144 --> 00:44:44,702
You back in touch with Perotti?

768
00:44:46,314 --> 00:44:48,475
- What are you talking about?
- Maybe you should speak

769
00:44:48,549 --> 00:44:50,574
to the people that own
your own thing, Bobby.

770
00:44:50,652 --> 00:44:53,018
Tell 'em to give it back to you,
you know, free and clear.

771
00:44:53,087 --> 00:44:55,317
Pop, what are you talking about?

772
00:44:58,993 --> 00:45:00,961
Would you consider my offer?

773
00:45:04,532 --> 00:45:06,932
- Would you give me that?
- Yeah yeah.

774
00:45:07,001 --> 00:45:10,266
I'll think about it.
I really will.

775
00:45:10,338 --> 00:45:12,602
Listen, I'm gonna get going.

776
00:45:12,674 --> 00:45:14,335
I just stopped by to say hello.

777
00:45:14,409 --> 00:45:15,740
Oh.

778
00:45:18,846 --> 00:45:20,644
You'd better get it right this time.

779
00:45:23,185 --> 00:45:24,652
Straighten out your act.

780
00:45:25,921 --> 00:45:27,411
All right, Pop.

781
00:46:13,803 --> 00:46:16,829
The evidence at hand

782
00:46:16,906 --> 00:46:19,397
To know they're not my shoes

783
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:23,001
She said,
"If there's..."

784
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:26,014
Wait wait, you said you wanted
to hear me sing, right?

785
00:46:26,082 --> 00:46:30,018
The evidence at hand...

786
00:46:30,086 --> 00:46:32,714
I spent every penny
I saved making it.

787
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,120
It's my demo.

788
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:36,723
This is the song I want to make

789
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,454
a music video out of one day.

790
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:43,966
# I play the fool

791
00:46:44,033 --> 00:46:46,968
# I sold myself...

792
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:49,838
So what do you think?

793
00:46:51,274 --> 00:46:53,538
Do you think you can handle me?

794
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:58,775
# Come on

795
00:46:58,848 --> 00:47:03,251
# I know you can't
resist my touch

796
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:06,949
# Feels like much too much

797
00:47:07,024 --> 00:47:12,087
# Come on

798
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:16,759
# Baby, baby, let's not fight

799
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,099
# Let's make love tonight

800
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:24,838
# You can't fight it

801
00:47:24,909 --> 00:47:28,470
# No escape

802
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:32,880
# Feel the touch of my skin

803
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:38,017
# You can't hide it

804
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:41,285
# It's too late

805
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:47,126
# You know you want to give in

806
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:53,660
# I can feel you want me so

807
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:56,865
# Close your eyes

808
00:47:56,941 --> 00:48:00,708
# And just let go

809
00:48:00,779 --> 00:48:03,509
# Come on...

810
00:48:03,582 --> 00:48:05,283
# Come back around,
I know you can...

811
00:48:05,283 --> 00:48:07,012
# Come back around,
I know you can...

812
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:08,712
Rena was a distraction,

813
00:48:08,787 --> 00:48:10,015
but a good one.

814
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:11,988
What really mattered though

815
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:14,651
was making room
for my crew again...

816
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:19,060
which meant cleaning up this mess.

817
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:23,066
Patsy, we gotta do
something about this guy.

818
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:26,001
He's out there planning jobs
without even contacting me.

819
00:48:26,071 --> 00:48:28,631
He hasn't reported to me
once since he come out.

820
00:48:28,707 --> 00:48:31,369
I mean, did you tell him
I was gonna be his captain?

821
00:48:31,443 --> 00:48:32,967
Sally, Sally, I told him.

822
00:48:33,044 --> 00:48:34,341
And then he goes and steals

823
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,175
Ray's girlfriend from him.

824
00:48:36,248 --> 00:48:39,479
First he goes and smacks him
and makes a fool of him,

825
00:48:39,551 --> 00:48:42,884
and then he goes and picks
the girl up in the same place.

826
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:45,320
I mean, that's not right, Patsy.

827
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:47,915
Sally, that's enough, okay?
The kid's just trying to earn

828
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:50,359
just to get back into my good graces.

829
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:53,489
And do you really think I give
a fuck about Ray's girlfriend?

830
00:48:53,566 --> 00:48:55,158
He's embarrassed.

831
00:48:55,234 --> 00:48:56,929
He's not even showing
his face around.

832
00:48:57,003 --> 00:48:58,436
You know, I think
they wrapped that rubber band

833
00:48:58,504 --> 00:49:00,028
around your balls
instead of your stomach.

834
00:49:00,106 --> 00:49:01,539
And they must've
wrapped it too tight,

835
00:49:01,607 --> 00:49:03,598
because you ain't thinking right.

836
00:49:03,676 --> 00:49:06,941
This kid could be a real loose cannon
if you provoke him, Sally.

837
00:49:07,013 --> 00:49:09,004
I'm telling you now... just relax.

838
00:49:09,081 --> 00:49:10,878
Don't go talking
about him to anybody,

839
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:12,918
because he'll find out
then you got problems.

840
00:49:16,022 --> 00:49:17,853
All right, listen to me.

841
00:49:17,924 --> 00:49:21,121
Sally, you can't provoke him.

842
00:49:24,121 --> 00:49:28,121
