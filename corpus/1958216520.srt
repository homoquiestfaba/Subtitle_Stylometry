1
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,626
- No! No!

2
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,332
- Wakey, wakey.

3
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,972
Here comes the tickle monster.

4
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,975
Come on, it's time to get up.

5
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:56,144
Good morning. Be
careful, please.

6
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:01,883
- Are you really gonna
go all by yourself?

7
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:03,183
- I still have to do it.

8
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,086
- But aren't you afraid?

9
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:06,521
- I'm gonna be okay.

10
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:07,822
- But what if you're
not back in time for-

11
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:08,890
- Good morning.

12
00:03:08,923 --> 00:03:10,424
How you feeling today, Mia?

13
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,259
- Fine, thanks.
- Good.

14
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,997
I was thinking of having
a birthday dinner for you.

15
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,365
18. It's a big deal.

16
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:22,637
I remember just yesterday

17
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,840
you were a scruffy teenager
arriving at my house.

18
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:26,841
- Yeah.

19
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:29,242
Well, thank you.

20
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,311
But really, I don't
need anything.

21
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,147
I really don't.
- Oh, come on.

22
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:35,049
It's good for all the kids.

23
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:37,018
You're gonna be an adult.

24
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:38,285
Come on. It'll be nice.

25
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:40,988
- I think I'm gonna
run in to the library.

26
00:03:41,022 --> 00:03:42,056
- Okay.

27
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,124
- There are some
books I wanna get.

28
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:44,458
Well, get some

29
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,027
for when you're at the
hospital too, okay?

30
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,528
- Yeah, sure.

31
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,931
Hey, do you think I
could borrow some money

32
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:53,167
for buses and, you know, snacks?

33
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:54,535
- Okay.
- Pretty please.

34
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,504
- Yes, yes, yes.
- You're the best.

35
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:57,572
- I know.

36
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:01,542
- Thank you. I'll be back
before lunch, Mrs. R.

37
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:02,877
- Okay.
- Thank you. Mwah.

38
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,444
- Bye.
- Bye.

39
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:07,715
- So kids,
what are we gonna do today?

40
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:37,277
- Hey man,
it's been a while.

41
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,648
Can you believe I've already
been home for three weeks?

42
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,383
I'm so bored. Come over.

43
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,620
You can't ignore me forever.

44
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:57,364
- Morning.
Cream or butter?

45
00:04:57,397 --> 00:04:58,599
- Thanks, Mom, but.

46
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:00,635
- Right. Not hungry
today either.

47
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:02,537
- Hey, buddy.

48
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:09,544
Ah, well, um, we talked
to Josh last night.

49
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:12,280
Seems like he's doing
a little bit better.

50
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,781
- He asked us about you
again and we told him-

51
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:15,315
- Yeah, I know.

52
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,551
I'm gonna go see him right now.

53
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,986
- Oh, I think he'll
appreciate that.

54
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,453
- Yeah.

55
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:21,956
- Have you responded to
the scholarship letter?

56
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:25,259
Come on, Kyle, they are not
gonna hold your place forever.

57
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:27,128
- Well, then they should
give it to someone else.

58
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,529
- No, this is not-
- Honey.

59
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:34,302
Honey, you have the whole
summer before you have to go.

60
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,170
Sign the entrance enrollment.

61
00:05:36,204 --> 00:05:37,672
Then see how you feel.

62
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:40,473
- I don't think I'll
be back for lunch.

63
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:43,811
- Hey, here, take this with you.

64
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:45,880
Here you go.

65
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:52,653
- I don't know what to say.

66
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,088
- Why did you
have to say that again?

67
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:57,158
- He can't throw
away his soccer scholarship.

68
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,392
He didn't go to
graduation, fine,

69
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,329
but bailing on his scholarship?

70
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,664
- You've got
to give him more time.

71
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,867
It's only been a few
months since the accident.

72
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,201
He'll come around.

73
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:08,803
- I hope so.

74
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:53,240
- Hey,
you get lost or what?

75
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:55,309
Said you're coming hours ago.

76
00:07:55,343 --> 00:08:00,147
- Yeah, I- I walked.

77
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,820
- Hey, don't,
don't worry about it.

78
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:10,825
I know it looks bad, but
it feels a lot worse.

79
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,233
So, um, where've you been?

80
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:28,142
- First two editions
of "Sun Eater."

81
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,878
- Thanks, dude.

82
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,115
You're the best.

83
00:08:40,388 --> 00:08:41,856
So have you talked to them yet?

84
00:08:43,324 --> 00:08:44,592
Noah's parents?

85
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:48,863
They've called a bunch of times.

86
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,899
They wanna talk to us.

87
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,037
You still can't remember?

88
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:58,539
You know, what
happened before the?

89
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:01,876
Me neither.

90
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,879
They say it's normal.

91
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,851
- I'm so sorry, boys,

92
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:12,586
but the, um, physical
therapist called,

93
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,989
he's gonna be here any
minute, so I think you should.

94
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:18,692
- Yeah, yeah, of course,
um.

95
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:20,895
I- I'll come back later.

96
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,668
- We haven't summoned the
courage to tell him yet,

97
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:31,906
but he may never walk again.

98
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:37,211
It's a blessing that you didn't
get more hurt than you did.

99
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,049
Just, just look at you.

100
00:09:43,284 --> 00:09:44,919
There's barely a scratch on you.

101
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:51,258
And Josh, he's just broken.

102
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:53,828
And Noah.

103
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:59,266
Noah.

104
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:03,604
There's not.

105
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,274
There's not an
hour that goes by.

106
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,910
Not an hour goes by that I wish

107
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:11,946
he hadn't gotten into
that car with you.

108
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:13,307
I wish he hadn't gotten
into that car with you.

109
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,808
And Noah.

110
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,110
Just look at you,
not a scratch on you.

111
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:17,678
He hadn't gotten
into that car with.

112
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:18,647
Not a scratch on you.

113
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:31,325
- Help!

114
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:39,266
- Hey! Can you hear me?

115
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,006
- Oh, oh, ow! Oh.

116
00:11:47,841 --> 00:11:49,043
- Are you all right?

117
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,177
You passed out.

118
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,914
Are you feeling better?

119
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,019
- Get it off me, get it off me!

120
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,921
Gross. Ooh.

121
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:04,024
Oh, I'm sorry.

122
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,529
Oh, it's, I- I'm usually
not this hysterical.

123
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:09,163
It's just that, um,
when I was a kid,

124
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:10,864
a lizard crawled
into my bed once.

125
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:11,966
And, you know, when
you're five years old,

126
00:12:11,999 --> 00:12:13,500
that could be
really traumatizing.

127
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:16,070
- People don't scream when
they're about to pass out.

128
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:18,405
- No?

129
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:20,074
- No.

130
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:22,711
- Okay, well, I'm epileptic
and so I can always tell

131
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,178
when I'm about to faint.

132
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:25,547
And because of that, I
scream because I get scared.

133
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,747
Hold on, hold on a minute.

134
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,716
I just, I think
that we should talk.

135
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,684
- Just mind your own business.

136
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:31,385
- No, no. Don't you get it?

137
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,254
You are my business.

138
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,155
If I let you do what I
think you are about to do,

139
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,391
I will never be able
to forgive myself.

140
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,294
And your mother would never
be able to forgive me either.

141
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:41,295
- Just go home.

142
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:43,397
- No.

143
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,633
- Fine.

144
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,467
- No. If you jump,
I'm gonna jump.

145
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,640
- What the? Hey, stop.

146
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,244
- Do you believe me now?

147
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,380
Monkey see, monkey do.

148
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,953
- This has gotta be a nightmare.

149
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:09,290
Just go away.

150
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:10,592
- Never.

151
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:11,626
Ooh, it's unlocked.

152
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,427
- Gimme my phone back.

153
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,128
- Mm-mm.

154
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:17,431
I'm gonna text myself
so I have your number.

155
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:20,535
- Who are you?

156
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:23,103
- My name's Amelia.

157
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:25,973
Amelia Faith, but
you can call me Mia.

158
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,681
Hi.
- Finally.

159
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:34,048
I was getting worried.

160
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,316
- I'm so sorry. I just,

161
00:13:35,349 --> 00:13:38,152
I- I lost track of
time at the library.

162
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:40,287
- Mia, just be honest with me

163
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:42,691
and you better not have
your fingers crossed

164
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:43,857
behind your back.

165
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,630
- Maybe we should try
another counselor.

166
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:50,931
- No, come on, Lisa,
it has been months

167
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:53,000
and he's getting
worse day after day.

168
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:56,070
And he won't talk. He won't eat.

169
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:58,205
I mean, he barely even
looks at us anymore.

170
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:01,342
Hey.

171
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:09,183
- How'd it go with Josh?

172
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,208
- I knew it.

173
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,761
- Hey. If it isn't
my favorite foster sis.

174
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:54,495
How's Mrs. Rothswell doing?

175
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,029
- She's good.

176
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,365
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

177
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,068
Can you still do your
responsible mother voice?

178
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,175
Hi, my name is Mia.

179
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,577
I'm a really good
friend of Kyle's.

180
00:15:09,611 --> 00:15:10,911
- Oh.
- Him and I

181
00:15:10,944 --> 00:15:12,379
were having a
conversation the other day

182
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,982
and he said that he's obviously
going through a hard time.

183
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,718
- Right.
- And he really felt

184
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:17,918
like he needed to get away.

185
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,052
So I just thought that, um,

186
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,522
it might make you feel better

187
00:15:20,555 --> 00:15:21,922
if you could speak to my mom.

188
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,056
- Yeah.
- Dammit.

189
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:23,892
- Hi.
- Hi.

190
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,860
- Hi, Mrs. Faith.

191
00:15:25,894 --> 00:15:27,961
It's just such a surprise.

192
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:30,030
Thank you very much, Mrs. Faith.

193
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,900
We'll be sure to let him know.

194
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,568
Such an amazing offer.

195
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:38,540
Oh? Yeah, he's been going
through tough times.

196
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,742
I. Ah-huh.

197
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:42,109
Here he is now.

198
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:44,378
- Oh.

199
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:47,782
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

200
00:15:47,816 --> 00:15:48,716
Okay, bye.

201
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,950
She is so chatty.

202
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:54,087
Hey, so I was just
filling your parents in

203
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:55,623
on what we talked
about yesterday.

204
00:15:56,558 --> 00:15:57,926
- Uh?

205
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,694
- With you saying that
you needed to get away.

206
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:03,397
And my mom inviting you to spend
some time with us in Spain.

207
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,867
She's a photographer, a
really, really good one.

208
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,234
And so she travels a lot

209
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:09,303
and she's been there
for a week already

210
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:10,971
and she says that we're
just gonna love it.

211
00:16:11,004 --> 00:16:12,740
- She seems really nice.

212
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:16,109
But Kyle, honey, why haven't
you ever told us about Mia?

213
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,246
- Because I just-
- No, no.

214
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,582
No, no.

215
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:22,449
You're not gonna tell
them how we met, are you?

216
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:25,520
That is so
embarrassing.

217
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:29,122
- Okay, so you're saying
that you wanna travel now?

218
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,325
- Mm-hmm, he said that
he would not miss it.

219
00:16:32,627 --> 00:16:33,994
- Can I talk to Mia in private?

220
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:35,730
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

221
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:41,034
- What are you doing here?

222
00:16:41,068 --> 00:16:42,269
- I'm trying to get
your parents on board

223
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,671
for you to come to Spain.

224
00:16:43,705 --> 00:16:46,206
- Spain?
- Yes. Spain.

225
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,308
The place between
France and Portugal.

226
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:51,111
Come with me for 10
days. All expenses paid.

227
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:52,780
Just get outta town
for a little while.

228
00:16:52,814 --> 00:16:53,648
- Forget it.

229
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:58,620
- Okay, look, your
parents are very nice,

230
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:01,488
but they also seem very
concerned for your wellbeing.

231
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,560
I could tell them
how we actually met

232
00:17:05,593 --> 00:17:07,427
or you could come with me.

233
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,196
And if you still wanna kick
the bucket after the trip,

234
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,765
I won't stop you.

235
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:12,299
Deal?

236
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:16,004
- Mom, Dad. Mia's leaving.

237
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:17,739
- Okay, look, no, you
can think about it.

238
00:17:17,772 --> 00:17:18,806
You don't have to decide now.

239
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:19,908
You can just let me know tonight

240
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:21,475
or, or maybe tomorrow.

241
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,645
I'll be back.

242
00:17:23,678 --> 00:17:25,847
Well, it was really
nice to meet you guys.

243
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,047
Thank you so much.

244
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,282
My mom, she just
really wanted me

245
00:17:28,315 --> 00:17:29,717
to meet you guys in person.

246
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:32,319
There are so many, you know,
crazy people out there.

247
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,154
She just.
- Of course.

248
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:35,155
- It was a pleasure to meet you.

249
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:36,758
- Really nice meeting you.

250
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:39,027
- Um, hon, just to let you know,

251
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,127
your, your shirt's
on inside out.

252
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,829
- Oh no, I do that on purpose.

253
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:43,531
- Oh!
- Yeah.

254
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:45,232
It makes me feel like I'm a
little bit less conventional,

255
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:46,668
or, or something.
- Oh.

256
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:48,168
- Oh, wait. Hey, Kyle.

257
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,837
Don't forget to text me a
picture of your passport

258
00:17:49,871 --> 00:17:50,872
and all that jazz.

259
00:17:50,905 --> 00:17:52,205
We leave in three days.

260
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,875
- I'm gonna kill you.

261
00:17:53,908 --> 00:17:55,543
- Yay. Bye.

262
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:03,417
- Why do you think he never
said anything about her?

263
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,686
She's lovely.

264
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:06,754
- He hasn't told us
anything in three months.

265
00:18:11,926 --> 00:18:12,760
- Come in.

266
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:15,597
- Hey, buddy.

267
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,197
Your mom and I just
finished reading this.

268
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,433
We thought you might
get something out of it.

269
00:18:21,836 --> 00:18:23,905
Hey, you know what?

270
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:25,405
I got an idea.

271
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,675
What do you say that you
and I take a soccer ball,

272
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:29,577
hit the field, you
can work on your PKs.

273
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:31,646
I don't think you can
score on me today.

274
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,113
- No, I'm okay.

275
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:36,884
- Okay. Plan B.

276
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,887
There is a big
FIFA match tonight.

277
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:41,288
You, me, pizza.

278
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,091
Watching it together
on the couch.

279
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,125
- Not tonight, okay?

280
00:18:53,568 --> 00:18:58,106
- Son, I know what
you're going through

281
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,642
is incredibly challenging,

282
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:03,310
but you can't stay locked up

283
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:06,179
in your room day
after day, hiding.

284
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:08,148
- Can we please not do this?

285
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:09,282
- No, we are.

286
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,652
We're gonna do this right now.

287
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:12,954
You've been pushing
us away for too long.

288
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:14,488
Something has to change.

289
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,458
Do you think that if
you get outta here

290
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:20,460
and you go to Spain,
that that's gonna help?

291
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,096
'Cause if you do,
I want you to go.

292
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,397
- No, I don't wanna go.

293
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,599
- You don't wanna go?

294
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:26,266
You know what, what
do you wanna do?

295
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:29,504
You wanna stay in here for
another three months, moping?

296
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:30,805
- What do you want from me?

297
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:33,173
- I want my son back.

298
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,642
I want you.

299
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,381
- He's gone, Dad.

300
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:42,817
- What?

301
00:19:44,552 --> 00:19:46,854
Kyle.

302
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:54,662
Here.

303
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,468
Go find him.

304
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:15,883
- This is for you.

305
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,189
Looks pretty. Like you.

306
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,223
- Do you really have to go?

307
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,827
- Yeah.

308
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,563
This is my chance to
get some answers, Becca.

309
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:30,932
I hope you can understand.

310
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:35,870
Hey, come here.

311
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:42,043
I have to tell you
something really important.

312
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:44,212
My best friend once told me,

313
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,245
no matter what happens,

314
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:47,048
no matter where I am,

315
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:49,884
there will always be
somebody somewhere

316
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,586
who is glad you were born.

317
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,422
Okay? So don't be sad.

318
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,603
- Why are you smiling?

319
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:10,605
- I just got some good
news about my trip.

320
00:21:13,306 --> 00:21:14,742
- Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

321
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:16,544
On behalf of the
captain and crew,

322
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:18,445
we would like to
welcome you aboard.

323
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:21,082
Our flight to Madrid,
Spain will 13 hours-

324
00:21:21,115 --> 00:21:22,415
- I am so excited.

325
00:21:22,449 --> 00:21:24,786
I've been planning
this trip for years

326
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:28,288
and I've been thinking
about it, well, forever.

327
00:21:30,258 --> 00:21:31,424
Have you ever had a dream

328
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,627
and it finally comes true

329
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,595
and then you just don't
know what to feel?

330
00:21:34,629 --> 00:21:37,098
That is exactly what
I'm feeling right now.

331
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:38,065
Please take a moment

332
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:39,700
to review the safety data card

333
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:41,636
in the seat pocket
in front of you.

334
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:45,506
- Hey, hey, maybe we
ought to watch this.

335
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,275
- To
fasten your seatbelt,

336
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:50,278
insert the metal fitting
one into the other,

337
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:53,681
tighten by pulling the
loose ends of the straps.

338
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:56,818
Should the cabin experience
any pressure loss

339
00:21:56,851 --> 00:22:00,487
stay calm and listen
for instructions
from your cabin crew.

340
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:03,791
Oxygen masks will-
- Oh! Cool, thank you.

341
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:06,594
- Place the mask
over your mouth and nose.

342
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:08,629
If you are traveling
with children, make sure

343
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:11,532
your own mask is on first
before helping them.

344
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:13,366
- It's my first
time on an airplane.

345
00:22:14,735 --> 00:22:17,138
It's actually my first
time outside of California.

346
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:19,140
Isn't that so exciting?

347
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:21,609
I've always wondered what it
would be like on an airplane.

348
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:25,012
How big up-ahead
storage would be?

349
00:22:25,046 --> 00:22:26,614
I thought it would be
smaller than this, actually.

350
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:28,316
I was pleasantly surprised.

351
00:23:18,032 --> 00:23:19,100
- Oh, here it is.

352
00:23:20,034 --> 00:23:20,868
- Ah!

353
00:23:26,707 --> 00:23:30,044
- So you're the girl who
booked the Tuc Tuc a year ago.

354
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:31,312
- Mm-hmm.

355
00:23:31,345 --> 00:23:32,213
You like to plan ahead.

356
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:35,016
So I guess that's Noah?

357
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:39,854
- No. No, Noah couldn't make it.

358
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:42,290
- Oh, okay.
- Ah. But this is Kyle.

359
00:23:42,323 --> 00:23:44,725
Kyle Thompson. Here is his info.

360
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,863
- Bueno, then if you can
give Noah his receipt,

361
00:23:48,896 --> 00:23:53,500
then I will just add Kyle
to the paperwork, and yes.

362
00:23:53,534 --> 00:23:54,769
Okay, this is for you.

363
00:23:55,603 --> 00:23:57,104
Let's go see the van.
- Okay.

364
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:04,679
- Here it is.

365
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:06,580
Fully equipped,
exactly as advertised.

366
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:08,382
You have a kitchen,
you have a stove,

367
00:24:08,416 --> 00:24:09,884
uh, the bed on the back,

368
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,652
and you also have
Bluetooth connection,

369
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:14,255
if you want to listen to
music while you drive,

370
00:24:14,288 --> 00:24:15,756
it'll be perfect.

371
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:18,225
And I guess that's
pretty much it,

372
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:21,228
so, uh, see you in 10 days.

373
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:24,765
Oh, could you please take
care of her for me, okay?

374
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,633
- Mm-hmm.

375
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:35,810
- You must be crazy if you think

376
00:24:35,843 --> 00:24:36,978
that I'm getting in
this thing with you.

377
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:38,346
Especially with you
behind the wheel.

378
00:24:38,379 --> 00:24:40,848
- No, I don't know how to drive.

379
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:42,283
You're driving.

380
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:43,617
- The hell I am.

381
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:20,054
- Hey, hey, nobody turns
off my favorite song.

382
00:25:21,355 --> 00:25:22,790
It's a good song.

383
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,172
- You know, on second thought,

384
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:40,341
I think that we might
need to renegotiate

385
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:42,143
the terms of our agreement.

386
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:44,812
At this rate I'm gonna
need like a month

387
00:25:44,845 --> 00:25:47,248
to hit up all the places
I'd like to visit.

388
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:53,020
Oh, come, come on.

389
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:56,690
You're really not
gonna ask me anything?

390
00:25:58,225 --> 00:25:59,193
Nothing about this trip.

391
00:26:01,295 --> 00:26:02,263
Nothing about me.

392
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:06,567
- Okay, okay. We
can talk about you.

393
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:10,571
Or not.

394
00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:31,526
- So, I bet you're wondering

395
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,060
why I'm taking so many pictures?

396
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:37,631
They're for my Photolog,

397
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,601
"Expiration Date."

398
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:44,205
You know? Expiration date.

399
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:45,372
It's like a metaphor.

400
00:26:52,413 --> 00:26:53,948
Okay.

401
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,285
How about this? I am starving.

402
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:01,122
I bet you are too.

403
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:03,958
Um.

404
00:27:04,758 --> 00:27:06,994
Okay, um, the next exit,

405
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:09,163
there's a restaurant
that has 4.7 stars.

406
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:13,267
Yeah, this exit.

407
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,704
Kyle.

408
00:27:18,105 --> 00:27:19,574
Kyle! Kyle!

409
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:37,424
- Don't ever do that again.

410
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:38,425
- I'm sorry, I
just thought that-

411
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:39,660
- Just shut up!

412
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:41,829
Stop thinking. Stop talking.

413
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:45,266
Just stop.

414
00:27:47,034 --> 00:27:47,868
- Okay.

415
00:27:51,138 --> 00:27:52,173
I'll be inside.

416
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:09,757
- Ah, I think
you mean pollo, chicken?

417
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,725
- Oh, si.
- Yeah. Okay.

418
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,996
- Pollo.

419
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,666
Something else?
- Ah, yeah.

420
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,166
Uh, a muffin?
- Of course.

421
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,034
- Por favor.

422
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:50,558
- So
are you gonna tell me

423
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:52,326
what this trip's about?

424
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:55,597
- He speaks.

425
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,097
Are you okay?

426
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:58,733
Do you need me to call an
ambulance or something?

427
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:00,134
You must be delirious.

428
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:04,305
- So?

429
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:07,975
- So this trip is
about finding my mom.

430
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:10,944
- Finding her?

431
00:30:10,978 --> 00:30:13,447
Didn't she talk to my parents
about meeting us out here?

432
00:30:15,349 --> 00:30:18,085
- No, that was, uh,

433
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:19,953
that was my foster sister.

434
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:21,288
- What?
- Yeah.

435
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:23,190
Yeah. The thing is,
is that I don't.

436
00:30:27,294 --> 00:30:29,430
I don't know my
mom. She left me.

437
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:32,801
Hey, but the cool thing is,

438
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,803
is that it's my birthday.

439
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,303
And how awesome would it be

440
00:30:36,337 --> 00:30:38,839
if I got to meet my mom on
the day that I was born?

441
00:30:40,441 --> 00:30:43,844
Happy birthday, Mia.

442
00:30:43,877 --> 00:30:44,878
- Thanks.

443
00:30:46,146 --> 00:30:48,650
- So where does this
mom of yours live?

444
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:49,950
- Well, over the last two years

445
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:51,720
I've been doing
a lot of research

446
00:30:51,753 --> 00:30:53,555
and I came up with
10 mother candidates.

447
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:56,624
The first is in Segovia.

448
00:30:56,658 --> 00:30:59,126
- Well, looks like you'll
meet her pretty soon then.

449
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,962
We just passed a sign that
says six kilometers to Segovia.

450
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:04,131
- Six kilometers?

451
00:31:04,164 --> 00:31:06,801
No. No, why didn't
you say something?

452
00:31:06,835 --> 00:31:09,303
No, I can't meet
my mom like this.

453
00:31:09,336 --> 00:31:10,839
I brought my favorite
shirt for her.

454
00:31:10,871 --> 00:31:12,373
I- I have to change.

455
00:31:12,406 --> 00:31:15,309
I can't believe that this is
finally happening right now.

456
00:31:15,342 --> 00:31:16,977
I mean, the mom is here-
- Mia, curtain!

457
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,445
- Look, I'm sorry, I just,

458
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,849
this is my favorite shirt and
I got it just to meet her.

459
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:22,316
God, get yourself
together, Mia Faith.

460
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:34,863
- It's getting a little
late, don't you think?

461
00:31:34,895 --> 00:31:36,731
I mean, we shouldn't
just be barging in

462
00:31:36,765 --> 00:31:39,667
on somebody unexpectedly
at this time.

463
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:44,071
I mean, they could
be having dinner.

464
00:31:44,104 --> 00:31:46,039
- Still pretty light out.

465
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:47,609
Plus, I read they have
dinner pretty late.

466
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:53,247
- No, we just landed
today and I'm exhausted.

467
00:31:54,214 --> 00:31:56,751
You know, I booked us
a place for tonight.

468
00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:59,119
Maybe we could go
there and get some rest

469
00:32:00,387 --> 00:32:02,956
and then we can go
meet her tomorrow.

470
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,275
- Happy birthday, Mia.

471
00:33:36,684 --> 00:33:37,351
- Kyle.

472
00:33:40,688 --> 00:33:41,856
Oh, come on.

473
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,659
Don't tell me that
you like to sleep in.

474
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,265
Kyle?

475
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:53,400
Kyle?

476
00:33:57,872 --> 00:33:59,507
No. No, no.

477
00:34:12,587 --> 00:34:13,387
Come on.

478
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:17,090
Pick up.

479
00:34:21,796 --> 00:34:25,332
What? Where were you?

480
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:28,201
- Oh, good morning to your too.

481
00:34:28,235 --> 00:34:29,469
I was taking a shower

482
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,405
and on my way back I
got us some breakfast.

483
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:33,041
- And you just took
all your stuff with you

484
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:34,509
to go take a shower?

485
00:34:34,943 --> 00:34:37,745
- Oh, actually, yes.

486
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:39,212
You were out cold

487
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:40,748
and I didn't wanna be
grabbing stuff outta my bag,

488
00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:42,282
making noise.

489
00:34:42,316 --> 00:34:45,019
- Oh, so you weren't
planning on leaving me

490
00:34:45,053 --> 00:34:46,420
and just taking off?

491
00:34:47,922 --> 00:34:50,625
- Of course not.
Deal's a deal, right?

492
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:52,927
Hey, watch the chocolate.

493
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:53,795
- Thank you.

494
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:57,799
Thank you for staying.

495
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,012
- Ah! No, no, no.

496
00:35:11,045 --> 00:35:13,081
How did that happen?

497
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:14,716
I spilled the hot chocolate.

498
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:18,586
I'm such a klutz, I
spilled it everywhere.

499
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,486
- I'm so sorry.

500
00:35:20,387 --> 00:35:21,723
- What am I supposed to do?

501
00:35:23,024 --> 00:35:25,125
I can't show up to
meet my mom like this.

502
00:35:30,665 --> 00:35:31,866
Oh man.

503
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,401
I can't believe this happened.

504
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:35,937
It's just this is
my favorite shirt

505
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,337
and I really wanted to wear it.

506
00:35:37,371 --> 00:35:39,373
- Hang on. I
think I got an idea.

507
00:35:46,146 --> 00:35:47,481
- Why you stopping?

508
00:35:47,515 --> 00:35:50,118
- Come on. We gotta get
you some new clothes.

509
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,385
- No, I'm fine, really,

510
00:35:51,418 --> 00:35:53,253
I'll figure something out.

511
00:35:53,286 --> 00:35:54,989
- "I'll figure something out."

512
00:35:55,023 --> 00:35:56,791
I'm not lending you my clothes.

513
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:57,491
- I can't.

514
00:35:58,626 --> 00:36:00,662
Really, I'm on a very
tight budget this trip.

515
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:02,930
- Well, consider it a
belated birthday gift.

516
00:36:04,164 --> 00:36:06,266
- No. No, I can't accept it.

517
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:07,568
- Of course you can.

518
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:09,169
Plus, my dad gave
me his credit card

519
00:36:09,202 --> 00:36:10,772
and if he sees I'm not
spending any money out here,

520
00:36:10,805 --> 00:36:13,508
then I dunno, he'll call
the embassy or something.

521
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:15,843
- No.

522
00:36:15,877 --> 00:36:18,378
- Okay, fine. Whatever.

523
00:37:36,456 --> 00:37:39,794
- You're crazy. Did you
buy the entire store?

524
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:41,062
- You need clothes.

525
00:37:41,095 --> 00:37:42,429
I couldn't made up my mind.

526
00:37:44,665 --> 00:37:47,334
- Okay, but I'm paying
you back every penny.

527
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:49,604
Thank you.

528
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:08,156
- You're not wearing
your clothes inside out.

529
00:38:08,189 --> 00:38:10,625
- What for? They're new.

530
00:38:13,094 --> 00:38:14,494
What's this?

531
00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:16,230
- Yeah, yeah, I know
you can't accept it,

532
00:38:16,264 --> 00:38:17,665
but it's my birthday
gift to you.

533
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:19,967
Happy birthday.

534
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:23,704
- Oh! Thank you.

535
00:38:31,411 --> 00:38:32,580
What do you think?

536
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:34,182
- Too big. Let's go
get you new ones.

537
00:38:34,215 --> 00:38:36,483
- No. No, I love them.

538
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:38,619
I've never had any before.

539
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:41,122
- Ray-Bans? It doesn't get
more classic than that.

540
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:43,024
- No. Sunglasses.

541
00:38:45,693 --> 00:38:46,527
- Vamos?

542
00:38:47,728 --> 00:38:49,096
- Vamos.

543
00:39:55,162 --> 00:39:56,731
Okay, one down.

544
00:39:57,865 --> 00:40:00,534
Which means we're one
mother closer. Right?

545
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:05,438
It's still pretty early.

546
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:06,374
Got a lot of rounds to make.

547
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:07,575
What's the next address?

548
00:42:27,048 --> 00:42:28,149
- No luck?

549
00:42:28,182 --> 00:42:28,883
- No.

550
00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:34,855
- Ah, my mom asked for pictures.

551
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:37,224
I just thought she'd liked
the street, that it's pretty.

552
00:42:37,258 --> 00:42:40,694
- Oh, and here I thought
you wanted to immortalize me

553
00:42:40,728 --> 00:42:43,597
in one of your drawings and
needed my picture as a model.

554
00:42:44,899 --> 00:42:45,699
Silly me.

555
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:55,209
Oh!

556
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:58,579
Oh. Wow.

557
00:43:00,381 --> 00:43:01,882
Nice moves.

558
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:03,552
Too bad those kids
aren't scouts.

559
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:05,419
You could get a scholarship.

560
00:43:05,453 --> 00:43:08,956
- I had a scholarship but I
didn't sign the paperwork.

561
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:09,790
- Why not?

562
00:43:11,025 --> 00:43:12,527
- Got tricked to going
into Spain with some girl

563
00:43:12,561 --> 00:43:13,928
trying to meet her mom.

564
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:18,265
Let's get a nice lunch on me.

565
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:26,541
What are those?

566
00:43:26,575 --> 00:43:27,842
- Just my vitamins.

567
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:30,111
- Hm. You know what I don't get?

568
00:43:30,144 --> 00:43:31,345
- Hmm?

569
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:33,447
- How the heck you were planning
on making this trip work

570
00:43:33,481 --> 00:43:35,483
if you don't know how to drive?

571
00:43:35,517 --> 00:43:37,751
- My best friend was
supposed to come.

572
00:43:37,785 --> 00:43:39,588
He really wanted to
help me find my mom,

573
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,955
but he couldn't make it.

574
00:43:40,988 --> 00:43:42,423
- And you still have to tell me

575
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:46,393
how you came up with this hit
list of mother candidates.

576
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:51,098
- Okay, so my former foster
brother turned hacker

577
00:43:51,132 --> 00:43:52,433
helped me look into it.

578
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:55,736
She's from Spain and she was
a former exchange student

579
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:57,238
in California.

580
00:43:57,271 --> 00:43:59,707
You know, he actually
helped me find this.

581
00:44:03,277 --> 00:44:05,646
- So what, you just like
searched up every woman

582
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:07,214
with this name in Spain?

583
00:44:07,915 --> 00:44:09,984
- Yeah. And the States too.

584
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:13,588
Fortunately there weren't many
women with that last name.

585
00:44:13,622 --> 00:44:14,822
That, and then Spanish women,

586
00:44:14,855 --> 00:44:17,458
they actually never
lose their maiden names.

587
00:44:17,491 --> 00:44:21,128
I just got really fed up with
all the unanswered questions.

588
00:44:21,162 --> 00:44:22,096
Who was she?

589
00:44:23,197 --> 00:44:24,198
What happened to her?

590
00:44:24,832 --> 00:44:26,000
What's her family like?

591
00:44:27,602 --> 00:44:29,703
What's my family like?

592
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:34,808
This is the only
thing I have of hers.

593
00:44:36,977 --> 00:44:38,946
- That's really pretty.

594
00:44:38,979 --> 00:44:39,813
- Yeah.

595
00:44:41,348 --> 00:44:46,020
- And at least you have
like foster siblings, right?

596
00:44:46,053 --> 00:44:50,559
- 24. I moved around a lot.

597
00:44:51,292 --> 00:44:54,361
12 different homes in my
18 years in the system.

598
00:44:54,395 --> 00:44:55,963
- That's a lot of homes.

599
00:44:55,996 --> 00:44:59,500
- Yeah, but none of
them are real homes.

600
00:44:59,534 --> 00:45:00,868
Not like yours.

601
00:45:02,036 --> 00:45:04,438
I've officially aged out
of the system now anyway.

602
00:45:04,471 --> 00:45:06,641
But Mrs. Rothswell did say
that I could stay with her

603
00:45:06,675 --> 00:45:08,242
until I go to college.

604
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,045
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

605
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:13,948
Oh, what are you doing?

606
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:15,149
I said I was gonna pay.

607
00:45:15,182 --> 00:45:16,850
- I just wanna see
how much I owe you.

608
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:18,018
- No. My treat means you
don't have to pay for it.

609
00:45:18,052 --> 00:45:19,486
- I know that's what
it means. I just-

610
00:45:19,521 --> 00:45:20,522
- Oh, sorry.

611
00:45:20,555 --> 00:45:22,056
- Um. No, it's okay.

612
00:45:31,065 --> 00:45:31,899
Kyle!

613
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:38,172
- Noah Green is your friend

614
00:45:38,205 --> 00:45:40,040
that was supposed
to come on this trip

615
00:45:40,074 --> 00:45:41,842
and you didn't think to
mention that fact to me?

616
00:45:41,875 --> 00:45:43,344
What is this? Some
kind of sick joke?

617
00:45:43,377 --> 00:45:47,881
- No. No, he was my best friend.

618
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:49,850
He set this whole trip up.

619
00:45:49,883 --> 00:45:51,385
- And you choose to bring me.

620
00:45:52,554 --> 00:45:53,387
The reason he's gone.

621
00:45:55,022 --> 00:45:57,091
What do you want from me?

622
00:45:57,124 --> 00:45:58,693
- I don't know.

623
00:45:58,727 --> 00:45:59,927
I recognized you at the park

624
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,895
and when I saw
you about to jump,

625
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:06,934
I- I thought that
I could help you.

626
00:46:08,102 --> 00:46:09,638
I thought that maybe we
could help each other.

627
00:46:09,671 --> 00:46:11,506
Kyle, I am so sorry.

628
00:46:38,432 --> 00:46:40,134
We met in photography class

629
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:43,203
a few summers ago.

630
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,442
We just hit it off instantly.

631
00:46:50,978 --> 00:46:53,013
He bought the plane tickets.

632
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:55,550
He helped me save my money.

633
00:46:57,318 --> 00:46:58,919
He even found the van.

634
00:47:06,594 --> 00:47:09,129
- We were in the, uh, the
same grade growing up.

635
00:47:11,666 --> 00:47:15,302
I remember playing freeze tag.

636
00:47:18,305 --> 00:47:21,175
And in first grade we were
on the same soccer team,

637
00:47:21,208 --> 00:47:25,045
but, um, he stopped playing.

638
00:47:29,249 --> 00:47:32,186
And then, uh, we, we'd see
each other in the halls

639
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:39,093
and, and nod, and that was it.

640
00:47:41,563 --> 00:47:43,063
I wish I had known him better.

641
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:47,868
- He was a one of a kind human.

642
00:48:00,247 --> 00:48:03,183
This says that the sand
dunes are unmissable

643
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:05,486
and that there's gonna be
a meteor shower tonight.

644
00:48:37,918 --> 00:48:40,387
- English?

645
00:48:40,421 --> 00:48:41,288
- American?

646
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:43,023
- Si, American.

647
00:48:44,992 --> 00:48:46,528
- License and registration.

648
00:48:46,561 --> 00:48:51,365
- Oh yes. Yes.

649
00:48:57,271 --> 00:48:59,072
- Do you know why
I pulled you over?

650
00:49:00,809 --> 00:49:02,677
You were driving too slow.

651
00:49:03,511 --> 00:49:04,945
Too slow.

652
00:49:06,213 --> 00:49:09,884
First time, warning.
Second time, fine.

653
00:49:09,918 --> 00:49:11,719
- Okay.
- Okay?

654
00:49:11,786 --> 00:49:13,020
- Okay, okay.

655
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:17,157
- Ola.

656
00:49:24,965 --> 00:49:27,468
You have to be the
only person under 80

657
00:49:27,501 --> 00:49:31,305
to be stopped for driving
too slow.

658
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,309
Let's go, gramps. Vamos!

659
00:50:00,935 --> 00:50:02,336
Can you smell it?

660
00:50:04,071 --> 00:50:05,673
I've died and gone to Venus.

661
00:50:08,275 --> 00:50:09,844
- You're certainly
from out of this world,

662
00:50:09,878 --> 00:50:12,145
so makes a lot of sense.

663
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:14,649
- Let's
get in the water.

664
00:50:14,682 --> 00:50:17,117
- Are you nuts? In your clothes?

665
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:20,788
- Oh, come on! Come
on, live a little.

666
00:50:23,525 --> 00:50:24,358
Come on.

667
00:51:16,778 --> 00:51:17,946
- I think we should have dinner

668
00:51:17,979 --> 00:51:19,413
before we miss
the meteor shower.

669
00:51:20,882 --> 00:51:23,150
- Yeah.

670
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,934
- You, you are such a nerd,
get outta here!

671
00:51:58,185 --> 00:52:00,454
- What's your favorite
place in the universe?

672
00:52:01,956 --> 00:52:03,524
Mine is Venus.

673
00:52:05,125 --> 00:52:06,928
I wish I could just
think about being there

674
00:52:06,961 --> 00:52:09,564
and boom, I'm there.

675
00:52:12,934 --> 00:52:14,368
- What's your deal with Venus?

676
00:52:14,401 --> 00:52:15,603
Why you like it so much?

677
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:22,342
- On my Venus, there's no war,

678
00:52:25,178 --> 00:52:28,549
no pain or hunger.

679
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:32,486
On my Venus there aren't parents

680
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:36,691
who don't love their
children, or even.

681
00:52:39,727 --> 00:52:40,494
- Death?

682
00:52:41,529 --> 00:52:43,497
- Death isn't such
a scary thing, Kyle.

683
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:51,572
- You know when you're dead

684
00:52:53,041 --> 00:52:54,742
you can't laugh anymore,

685
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:58,278
or hang out with your friends,

686
00:52:58,311 --> 00:53:02,116
or fall in love,

687
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:05,853
or eat a hamburger.

688
00:53:09,757 --> 00:53:10,925
Death sucks.

689
00:53:11,759 --> 00:53:13,226
- It was an accident.

690
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,702
- I lost control of the car.

691
00:53:57,972 --> 00:53:58,840
It was me.

692
00:54:02,577 --> 00:54:04,579
I was the one that
was behind the wheel.

693
00:54:05,913 --> 00:54:08,583
And I wasn't even supposed
to be driving Josh's car.

694
00:54:08,616 --> 00:54:13,588
- Kyle, Noah would not
wanna see you like this.

695
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:14,956
- I don't know that.

696
00:54:17,892 --> 00:54:19,292
And you can't ask him.

697
00:54:21,461 --> 00:54:23,430
And it's not even just Noah.

698
00:54:24,132 --> 00:54:25,432
My friend Josh,

699
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:28,435
I don't know if he'll
ever walk again.

700
00:54:30,905 --> 00:54:32,439
Who can live with that? Not me.

701
00:54:37,145 --> 00:54:38,679
- Kyle, there has to be a reason

702
00:54:38,713 --> 00:54:41,716
that you made it out okay
when the others didn't.

703
00:54:41,749 --> 00:54:43,618
This world, it can
be really harsh

704
00:54:45,253 --> 00:54:46,754
and really bad
things can happen,

705
00:54:48,756 --> 00:54:52,059
but you cannot give up
because you made a mistake.

706
00:54:52,093 --> 00:54:53,493
You've been given
a second chance

707
00:54:53,528 --> 00:54:56,063
to make a difference
in this world.

708
00:54:56,097 --> 00:54:57,565
It's all in how you look at it.

709
00:54:57,598 --> 00:54:59,734
I could be really upset
that my mom left me.

710
00:54:59,767 --> 00:55:02,970
Or I could just be happy
that she even had me.

711
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:06,941
- I wish I never existed.

712
00:55:11,012 --> 00:55:11,679
- Hey.

713
00:55:13,815 --> 00:55:14,949
Noah used to tell me,

714
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:19,452
"There will always
be somebody somewhere

715
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,322
who is happy that
you were born."

716
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:49,884
Kyle?

717
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:51,853
- Mia!

718
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,828
Hey! Hey, it's been two hours.

719
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:02,296
When on Earth are you
gonna tell me something?

720
00:56:14,642 --> 00:56:16,043
- Uh, are you with Amelia Faith?

721
00:56:16,077 --> 00:56:17,178
- Yeah. Is she okay?

722
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:18,378
- Yes. Yes, don't worry.

723
00:56:18,411 --> 00:56:20,314
It happens with people
in her condition.

724
00:56:20,348 --> 00:56:21,414
We are discharging her now.

725
00:56:21,448 --> 00:56:23,284
- Wait, wait, what condition?

726
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:25,119
- Oh, I thought.

727
00:56:25,152 --> 00:56:28,022
Well, in that case it's better
if she tells you herself.

728
00:56:31,424 --> 00:56:33,628
- Hey. Hey, are you okay?

729
00:56:39,634 --> 00:56:41,903
What condition was that
doctor talking about, Mia?

730
00:56:41,936 --> 00:56:44,238
- I'm fine. Just
forgot to take my pill.

731
00:56:44,272 --> 00:56:45,873
- Yeah, your vitamins.

732
00:56:45,907 --> 00:56:48,342
When are you gonna tell me
what's actually going on?

733
00:56:48,376 --> 00:56:50,745
- Okay, what's going on

734
00:56:50,778 --> 00:56:52,713
is that I have a
genetic heart defect.

735
00:56:53,881 --> 00:56:56,050
There. Boom.

736
00:56:57,752 --> 00:57:00,087
So it's fine. I'm releasing
you from our agreement.

737
00:57:01,656 --> 00:57:03,524
- No, no, I'm, I'm not
gonna just up and leave you.

738
00:57:03,557 --> 00:57:04,759
We had a deal, right?

739
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:07,695
It's fine. I'm
used to it by now.

740
00:57:07,728 --> 00:57:08,930
- No, Mia!

741
00:57:09,597 --> 00:57:12,934
You have an awesome chauffeur

742
00:57:13,668 --> 00:57:17,138
for the next couple
of days, so come on.

743
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:31,652
- Mrs. Rothswell?

744
00:57:33,921 --> 00:57:36,456
There's something
I have to tell you.

745
00:58:12,126 --> 00:58:15,162
- Okay. Who are you avoiding?

746
00:58:15,196 --> 00:58:16,597
- My foster mom.

747
00:58:17,398 --> 00:58:19,266
- Why?

748
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,002
- I kind of ran away.

749
00:58:21,035 --> 00:58:23,270
In that I didn't tell
her where I was going.

750
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:25,306
- Why not?

751
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:28,209
- Because Mrs. Rothswell
wanted me to stay home

752
00:58:28,242 --> 00:58:29,276
and have the surgery.

753
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:33,080
- Wait, hold on. What surgery?

754
00:58:34,815 --> 00:58:37,118
- I had an operation
scheduled for this week.

755
00:58:42,857 --> 00:58:45,292
- You decided to travel
to Spain instead?

756
00:58:46,293 --> 00:58:48,863
- My doctor said it was
perfectly safe for me to travel.

757
00:58:50,865 --> 00:58:52,933
And what's the point of
waiting my entire life

758
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:55,169
just to die on an
operating table

759
00:58:55,202 --> 00:58:56,804
before I get to meet my mom?

760
00:58:56,837 --> 00:58:58,672
- How dangerous is the surgery?

761
00:58:59,607 --> 00:59:03,878
- Half of the people die,
but half of them live.

762
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:15,189
- Are you, uh, are you scared?

763
00:59:16,924 --> 00:59:18,859
- Death has never
really scared me.

764
00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:23,564
- Then what are you
afraid of, Mia Faith?

765
00:59:25,232 --> 00:59:27,902
- I guess what I'm afraid
of is dying invisible.

766
00:59:29,336 --> 00:59:32,773
If you don't make a
difference in somebody's life,

767
00:59:32,807 --> 00:59:34,708
if you don't even try
to change the world,

768
00:59:34,742 --> 00:59:37,211
then what's the point
of ever being born?

769
00:59:37,244 --> 00:59:38,646
Of ever living?

770
00:59:39,713 --> 00:59:42,783
- Hence your Photolog.
- Yeah, I guess.

771
00:59:43,584 --> 00:59:46,020
- Okay, so how many views?

772
00:59:46,053 --> 00:59:47,522
- No idea.

773
00:59:47,556 --> 00:59:49,390
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

774
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:50,424
- Gimme your phone.

775
00:59:52,927 --> 00:59:53,761
- Okay.

776
00:59:58,165 --> 01:00:00,367
- Hm, oh. No wonder here.

777
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:02,937
Your account was on private.

778
01:00:04,105 --> 01:00:06,974
Why didn't you tell
me about your heart?

779
01:00:08,642 --> 01:00:09,944
- I guess I just,

780
01:00:11,145 --> 01:00:12,746
I wanted to see what
it would feel like

781
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:15,382
to be a normal girl for once.

782
01:00:36,538 --> 01:00:37,938
- Hold that pose.

783
01:00:37,972 --> 01:00:39,173
- You're seriously taking
pictures right now?

784
01:00:39,206 --> 01:00:40,975
- Come on, we've got
moms to meet. Let's go.

785
01:01:18,712 --> 01:01:22,750
- Well, this is the last mother.

786
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:25,019
- She has to be the one.

787
01:01:26,987 --> 01:01:28,822
- I guess our journey ends here.

788
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:35,829
Um, you know, you're,
you and your mom

789
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:38,032
are probably gonna have
a, a lot to talk about.

790
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,169
So in case I don't get
another chance to tell you,

791
01:01:42,203 --> 01:01:43,270
I just.
- Wait, um.

792
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:46,774
Let's just enjoy this moment.

793
01:02:03,891 --> 01:02:04,925
Wait, hi! Hi!
- Excuse me.

794
01:02:04,959 --> 01:02:06,427
Excuse me.
- Hi. Hi!

795
01:02:07,361 --> 01:02:08,563
- Si?

796
01:02:08,597 --> 01:02:10,565
- Maria Astilleros?

797
01:02:12,534 --> 01:02:13,367
- I'm sorry to bother you.

798
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,501
Do you speak English?

799
01:02:14,536 --> 01:02:15,803
- A little rusty.

800
01:02:15,836 --> 01:02:17,539
I haven't really practiced

801
01:02:17,572 --> 01:02:19,940
since I was an exchange student

802
01:02:19,974 --> 01:02:24,345
in the USA a long
time ago in New York.

803
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:30,951
- Wait, did you
say, um, New York?

804
01:02:33,821 --> 01:02:37,024
Oh, I, we were
looking for somebody,

805
01:02:37,057 --> 01:02:40,528
but, um, but we were wrong.

806
01:02:42,564 --> 01:02:43,330
I'm sorry.

807
01:02:46,568 --> 01:02:48,235
- Excuse us.

808
01:02:48,269 --> 01:02:49,571
Thank you so much. We're
looking for someone else.

809
01:02:49,604 --> 01:02:50,404
Sorry.
- Okay.

810
01:02:52,906 --> 01:02:53,941
- It's not her.

811
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:55,476
- Mia.
- Kyle, I,

812
01:02:57,044 --> 01:02:58,379
I just need some space.

813
01:03:00,548 --> 01:03:02,249
- But.

814
01:03:17,431 --> 01:03:20,669
- Mia's phone. Please
leave a message after the beep.

815
01:03:20,702 --> 01:03:22,403
- Mia, where are you?

816
01:03:22,436 --> 01:03:25,640
I've been waiting a long
time. Please answer.

817
01:03:32,279 --> 01:03:36,050
Have you guys, um, seen,
uh, blonde hair, uh, uh.

818
01:03:44,158 --> 01:03:48,329
- Mia's phone. Please leave
a message after the beep.

819
01:04:22,664 --> 01:04:24,632
The next campsite
is two hours away.

820
01:04:25,999 --> 01:04:27,201
- I got a better idea.

821
01:04:37,878 --> 01:04:38,847
- Let me check

822
01:04:38,879 --> 01:04:40,948
if there are any
available rooms.

823
01:04:44,451 --> 01:04:45,285
- Mia, look.

824
01:04:48,556 --> 01:04:49,691
- It's beautiful.

825
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:52,893
- You are in luck. We
just had a cancellation.

826
01:04:52,926 --> 01:04:55,062
It's a room with
a king size bed.

827
01:04:59,567 --> 01:05:00,234
- Okay.

828
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:03,505
Whoa!

829
01:05:06,373 --> 01:05:09,243
Kyle,
this is crazy nice.

830
01:05:10,879 --> 01:05:13,380
Wow. It's so beautiful.

831
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:18,252
This room is amazing!

832
01:05:18,285 --> 01:05:20,087
This is so cool.

833
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,524
This is bigger than
my whole house.

834
01:05:22,557 --> 01:05:24,692
This is so nice.

835
01:05:24,726 --> 01:05:26,861
What's up here?

836
01:05:26,895 --> 01:05:29,597
Oh my God.

837
01:05:29,631 --> 01:05:31,766
It has
a claw-foot tub.

838
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:32,901
I love claw-foot tu.

839
01:05:32,933 --> 01:05:36,403
Oh, and a nice cozy robe.

840
01:05:36,437 --> 01:05:38,673
Oh, that's so nice.

841
01:05:38,706 --> 01:05:41,776
Hey, do you mind if I
take a bath before dinner?

842
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:43,010
- No, of course not.

843
01:05:43,043 --> 01:05:44,546
I'll go call my parents
and get us a table.

844
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:45,412
- Okay.

845
01:05:56,825 --> 01:05:58,626
Hi, Mrs. Rothswell.

846
01:06:00,628 --> 01:06:02,530
I know, I know.

847
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:05,299
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.

848
01:06:06,835 --> 01:06:09,671
Yeah, Yeah, I'm fine.

849
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:16,109
No. No, I- I haven't
found her yet.

850
01:06:18,947 --> 01:06:21,148
Yeah. Yeah, it's still ticking.

851
01:07:09,998 --> 01:07:11,699
Sorry, I dozed off.

852
01:07:11,733 --> 01:07:14,334
- All too much excitement
for one day, I guess.

853
01:07:15,035 --> 01:07:16,704
Nice dress by the way.

854
01:07:16,738 --> 01:07:18,071
- Thank you.

855
01:07:19,406 --> 01:07:22,042
- I- I- I wasn't sure
what you wanted, so.

856
01:07:24,712 --> 01:07:26,179
- Thanks.

857
01:07:26,213 --> 01:07:29,316
- So, uh, listen, uh,
before we go home tomorrow,

858
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:31,819
maybe we could do
some site-seeing,

859
01:07:31,853 --> 01:07:33,688
go to a nice restaurant-
- Home?

860
01:07:35,122 --> 01:07:37,357
No, I can't go home. I
have to keep looking.

861
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:41,328
- For what? I mean, we found
all the names on the list.

862
01:07:41,361 --> 01:07:44,032
- Yeah, yeah, but maybe I
made a mistake or something.

863
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:45,733
- You can't be serious?

864
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:49,804
Mia, listen, you
have to go home.

865
01:07:49,837 --> 01:07:52,306
You need this operation.
This isn't some kinda game.

866
01:07:52,339 --> 01:07:54,042
- I know, but I have
to keep looking.

867
01:07:54,074 --> 01:07:55,910
- You can't keep putting
your life on the line

868
01:07:55,944 --> 01:07:57,311
looking for someone who,

869
01:07:58,913 --> 01:08:00,414
who might not wanna be found.

870
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:03,718
You've done your best, Mia.

871
01:08:05,853 --> 01:08:07,087
I'm sorry.

872
01:08:09,023 --> 01:08:11,425
- I know. You're right.

873
01:08:13,427 --> 01:08:15,395
But I just wanna
look her in the eyes

874
01:08:15,429 --> 01:08:19,067
and I wanna ask her
why she didn't keep me.

875
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:21,970
Ask her how she
could just abandon me

876
01:08:22,003 --> 01:08:23,638
and act like I
never even existed.

877
01:08:23,671 --> 01:08:26,708
- Well, maybe she did it
because it was best for you.

878
01:08:26,741 --> 01:08:28,576
Maybe she thought that
you were better off

879
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:29,744
with someone else.

880
01:08:30,745 --> 01:08:31,913
- You don't understand.

881
01:08:31,946 --> 01:08:34,281
- No, you don't understand.

882
01:08:34,314 --> 01:08:38,285
You know, maybe if you stopped
obsessing over some woman

883
01:08:38,318 --> 01:08:40,989
who did nothing but
give birth to you,

884
01:08:41,022 --> 01:08:42,356
you'd actually start
turning your attention

885
01:08:42,389 --> 01:08:44,458
to the people who
really care about you.

886
01:08:49,931 --> 01:08:52,132
- Kyle.

887
01:09:30,672 --> 01:09:33,775
I might be wrong, but I
need to see this through.

888
01:09:33,808 --> 01:09:37,111
Just gimme three days
and if I don't find her,

889
01:09:37,145 --> 01:09:38,813
I will go home and
have the surgery.

890
01:09:40,648 --> 01:09:41,516
I promise.

891
01:09:47,855 --> 01:09:49,757
- Three days, Mia.

892
01:09:51,425 --> 01:09:52,560
No more.

893
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:56,964
- And if anything goes wrong.

894
01:09:56,998 --> 01:09:57,832
- Hey.

895
01:10:00,868 --> 01:10:02,369
- If anything goes wrong,

896
01:10:04,371 --> 01:10:06,406
I'll see you on Venus.

897
01:11:08,136 --> 01:11:09,302
Good morning.

898
01:11:10,403 --> 01:11:11,606
- Morning.

899
01:11:11,639 --> 01:11:13,306
- Sorry, I didn't
hear you get up.

900
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:14,809
- Oh no, I didn't
wanna wake you up.

901
01:11:14,842 --> 01:11:17,277
Hey, so I've been thinking
a lot about your mother.

902
01:11:19,113 --> 01:11:21,249
And Mia, look at
your mom's signature.

903
01:11:21,281 --> 01:11:22,415
What does it say?

904
01:11:22,449 --> 01:11:24,619
- It says Maria Astilleros.

905
01:11:24,652 --> 01:11:28,523
- Or what if it said
Maria Ostilleros?

906
01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:32,392
Look, what if the A
was actually like an O

907
01:11:32,425 --> 01:11:33,661
and they just mistyped it?

908
01:11:35,495 --> 01:11:38,566
Oh, then I want you
to look at this.

909
01:11:41,269 --> 01:11:42,302
Open it.

910
01:11:48,176 --> 01:11:49,944
- It's the same as my necklace.

911
01:11:49,977 --> 01:11:51,579
- It's from that small town.

912
01:11:51,612 --> 01:11:54,649
And I looked it up and there's
a lot of Maria Ostilleros',

913
01:11:55,783 --> 01:11:57,985
but there's only one
that lives near there.

914
01:11:58,019 --> 01:12:00,922
- Oh my God.

915
01:12:00,955 --> 01:12:03,524
- And I just found an address.

916
01:12:09,964 --> 01:12:12,432
You know, we still have
two more hours to go.

917
01:12:12,465 --> 01:12:13,668
Why don't you get some sleep?

918
01:12:15,736 --> 01:12:17,972
If I see anything really
interesting, I'll wake you up.

919
01:12:18,005 --> 01:12:19,472
All right?

920
01:12:41,394 --> 01:12:43,598
Hey, you gotta see this.

921
01:12:44,397 --> 01:12:47,301
Hey. Hey, Mia.

922
01:12:47,335 --> 01:12:49,804
Mia. Mia?

923
01:12:49,837 --> 01:12:52,273
Hey, Mia? Mia!

924
01:12:59,379 --> 01:13:01,682
Can I please get an
update on Amelia Faith?

925
01:13:01,716 --> 01:13:04,018
- Excuse me? Are
you Amelia's friend?

926
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:04,986
- Yeah. Is she okay?

927
01:13:05,019 --> 01:13:06,587
- She's stable for now.

928
01:13:06,621 --> 01:13:09,924
However, her heart is very weak.

929
01:13:11,993 --> 01:13:14,528
I understand she's scared
of undergoing the surgery,

930
01:13:14,562 --> 01:13:17,965
but if she doesn't, she'll die.

931
01:13:23,571 --> 01:13:26,473
- How, how long do you
think she can hold out for?

932
01:13:27,208 --> 01:13:29,210
She's supposed to get the
surgery when we get home.

933
01:13:29,243 --> 01:13:31,078
- She could last
a month, a week.

934
01:13:31,112 --> 01:13:32,546
We just don't know.

935
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:35,149
But definitely she can't
fly in her condition.

936
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:37,018
- Can I see her?

937
01:13:37,852 --> 01:13:40,121
- I need you to convince her
to let us do the surgery.

938
01:13:40,154 --> 01:13:43,024
- Yeah. Yeah, sure, of course.

939
01:13:43,057 --> 01:13:44,525
- Could you
take her ID to the nurse

940
01:13:44,558 --> 01:13:46,459
so they can fill
out the paperwork?

941
01:13:47,128 --> 01:13:48,529
- Yeah.

942
01:14:07,915 --> 01:14:11,519
- Kyle? Please,
you have to help me.

943
01:14:13,754 --> 01:14:15,756
- Why is your
ticket only one-way?

944
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:21,929
You never intended on having
that surgery, did you?

945
01:14:23,463 --> 01:14:25,666
What was your plan, exactly?

946
01:14:26,968 --> 01:14:29,603
You just keep going
until you find her?

947
01:14:29,637 --> 01:14:31,906
Waste away until
you do. If you do.

948
01:14:31,939 --> 01:14:34,608
- No. Kyle.

949
01:14:34,642 --> 01:14:37,611
- No. Tell me it isn't true.

950
01:14:38,478 --> 01:14:42,149
Please tell me you're
gonna have that surgery.

951
01:14:47,321 --> 01:14:48,656
Dammit, Mia.

952
01:14:49,957 --> 01:14:52,927
You'd rather just give up
than risk what, exactly?

953
01:14:53,561 --> 01:14:54,795
Having someone love you?

954
01:14:55,863 --> 01:14:57,698
Or loving someone yourself?

955
01:14:58,432 --> 01:14:59,834
- You don't understand.

956
01:15:00,801 --> 01:15:03,204
My heart has an expiration date.

957
01:15:03,237 --> 01:15:04,672
- Then explain that to me.

958
01:15:08,376 --> 01:15:09,610
- I don't want them
to open my heart

959
01:15:09,643 --> 01:15:11,645
until I get to meet my mom.

960
01:15:16,884 --> 01:15:20,121
- What about me? What about us?

961
01:15:22,189 --> 01:15:23,190
- That is not fair.

962
01:15:24,725 --> 01:15:26,861
I shouldn't have to
choose one of you.

963
01:15:28,529 --> 01:15:30,031
- I- I can't do this.

964
01:15:30,064 --> 01:15:31,298
- Kyle!

965
01:16:00,361 --> 01:16:02,329
- Help! Help, help!

966
01:16:10,371 --> 01:16:11,506
- Bro, check this.

967
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:13,874
- Bro, chill, I'm driving.

968
01:16:13,908 --> 01:16:15,376
- Funniest
things I've seen in-

969
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:16,545
- I'm being serious.

970
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:17,845
- Just look at it.
- No, chill.

971
01:16:17,878 --> 01:16:20,848
Oh!

972
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:45,239
- Hey.

973
01:16:46,541 --> 01:16:47,908
- It's all coming back.

974
01:16:53,814 --> 01:16:57,418
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

975
01:16:58,052 --> 01:17:01,889
I couldn't bring myself to
tell you, but it was me.

976
01:17:02,123 --> 01:17:03,657
It was my phone.

977
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:06,961
I was totally wasted and
I showed you that video.

978
01:17:09,964 --> 01:17:11,265
- And, and I looked at it.

979
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:15,269
And, and I tried to get
around that motorcycle.

980
01:17:18,507 --> 01:17:19,940
It was an accident.

981
01:17:23,277 --> 01:17:28,082
So you just gotta learn from it.

982
01:17:28,949 --> 01:17:32,286
And, and forgive yourself.

983
01:17:36,457 --> 01:17:38,125
- I'm sorry, Kyle.

984
01:17:40,861 --> 01:17:43,130
- Yeah, me too, Josh.

985
01:18:06,053 --> 01:18:07,721
Mia!
- Kyle.

986
01:18:08,722 --> 01:18:10,625
- I'm so sorry.

987
01:18:10,659 --> 01:18:11,859
- I'm sorry too.

988
01:18:11,892 --> 01:18:13,894
- I can't even begin to imagine.

989
01:18:15,796 --> 01:18:18,866
But I wanna be by your side,

990
01:18:20,334 --> 01:18:23,971
and I don't care if, if it's
for an hour or, or for years.

991
01:18:24,004 --> 01:18:27,007
It don't matter. As
long as I'm with you.

992
01:18:31,546 --> 01:18:33,147
I'm gonna take you
to meet your mom.

993
01:18:33,881 --> 01:18:35,282
- Really? Aw.

994
01:18:36,417 --> 01:18:38,152
I just need a couple of hours.

995
01:18:38,185 --> 01:18:40,221
- But I need you to
promise me something.

996
01:18:43,324 --> 01:18:45,426
I need you to promise
me that you'll fight.

997
01:18:46,528 --> 01:18:47,662
That we'll, we'll come back

998
01:18:47,696 --> 01:18:49,598
and you'll have the operation

999
01:18:49,631 --> 01:18:50,632
and you'll do everything you can

1000
01:18:50,665 --> 01:18:52,499
to get through this for us.

1001
01:19:03,911 --> 01:19:07,214
- Okay. Okay.

1002
01:19:10,117 --> 01:19:11,085
- Thank you.

1003
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,754
- I love you.

1004
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:17,057
- I love you too.

1005
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,625
- Ola?
- Hi.

1006
01:22:04,024 --> 01:22:06,628
- Hi. Can I help you?

1007
01:22:07,294 --> 01:22:11,733
- Yeah, I came all the
way from the United States

1008
01:22:11,766 --> 01:22:13,267
because I'm looking for my mom

1009
01:22:14,636 --> 01:22:17,271
and I was wondering if
maybe you recognize this.

1010
01:22:27,948 --> 01:22:30,417
Ola, Mama.

1011
01:22:30,451 --> 01:22:34,087
- Amelia.

1012
01:22:55,309 --> 01:22:59,146
- Right, one more thing,
then we'll head back.

1013
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:20,100
- It's amazing.

1014
01:23:22,537 --> 01:23:24,004
- If things didn't
work out with your mom,

1015
01:23:24,037 --> 01:23:25,339
this was my backup plan.

1016
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:10,284
- I waited for that
moment for so long

1017
01:24:12,052 --> 01:24:13,588
and I had so many questions,

1018
01:24:16,456 --> 01:24:19,226
but when I got to that door
today, none of it mattered.

1019
01:24:22,897 --> 01:24:24,732
All I could think about was you.

1020
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:32,406
- Oh, and one more thing.

1021
01:24:40,213 --> 01:24:43,051
- My song?

1022
01:24:46,054 --> 01:24:47,454
- May I have this dance?

1023
01:24:48,756 --> 01:24:53,561
- Yes, you may.

1024
01:25:09,443 --> 01:25:13,380
- I'm scared.

1025
01:25:13,413 --> 01:25:16,818
- I'll be right
by your side, Mia.

1026
01:25:16,851 --> 01:25:18,118
- This is all your fault.

1027
01:25:22,356 --> 01:25:25,994
- I was never afraid to
die before I met you.

1028
01:25:26,027 --> 01:25:27,996
I don't wanna miss this.

1029
01:25:30,999 --> 01:25:34,902
- Mia? Mia!

1030
01:25:34,936 --> 01:25:35,937
No, no, no, no.

1031
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:38,238
Mia? Mia?

1032
01:25:38,773 --> 01:25:40,173
Mia!

1033
01:27:23,410 --> 01:27:25,479
Some people change
your life forever.

1034
01:27:27,715 --> 01:27:31,485
Some people make you strive
to be a better person.

1035
01:27:33,554 --> 01:27:36,090
Some people help
you find yourself

1036
01:27:36,124 --> 01:27:37,725
right when you're
ready to give up.

1037
01:27:40,427 --> 01:27:43,598
Some people aren't invisible.

1038
01:27:51,239 --> 01:27:53,674
Now, someone
special once told me

1039
01:27:53,708 --> 01:27:58,212
there will always be
somebody somewhere

1040
01:27:58,246 --> 01:27:59,714
who is happy that you were born.

1041
01:28:07,855 --> 01:28:09,791
Well, this is it.

1042
01:28:10,591 --> 01:28:14,061
- Oh! Please, uh,
be careful driving.

1043
01:28:14,095 --> 01:28:15,563
Are you sure it's safe?

1044
01:28:15,596 --> 01:28:17,765
- Yes, it's not like this
is my first road trip, Mom.

1045
01:28:18,966 --> 01:28:20,802
- I am proud of you son.

1046
01:28:24,504 --> 01:28:25,973
You take care of yourself.

1047
01:28:26,007 --> 01:28:26,841
- Yeah.

1048
01:28:29,277 --> 01:28:30,578
- Okay. Get outta here.

1049
01:28:30,611 --> 01:28:32,780
You only got two weeks
to get to Boston, so.

1050
01:28:54,802 --> 01:28:56,469
You sure you can
drive this thing?

1051
01:28:56,503 --> 01:28:57,805
It's harder than it looks.

1052
01:29:00,373 --> 01:29:02,243
- I had a pretty good teacher.

1053
01:29:28,769 --> 01:29:30,470
- I thought my trip
to Spain was about my past,

1054
01:29:30,503 --> 01:29:32,874
but it was really
about my future.

1055
01:29:32,907 --> 01:29:35,610
To find someone who
makes my heart so full

1056
01:29:35,643 --> 01:29:39,213
that it could burst,
but in a good way.

1057
01:29:39,714 --> 01:29:42,350
I've always looked
at Venus as a place,

1058
01:29:42,382 --> 01:29:45,385
but it turns out my
Venus was a person

1059
01:29:45,418 --> 01:29:47,355
and not the person I
thought it would be.

1060
01:29:47,387 --> 01:29:49,657
One who made life
worth fighting for.

1061
01:29:50,423 --> 01:29:51,926
- No. Put your hands
on the steering wheel.
