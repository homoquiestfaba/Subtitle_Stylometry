1
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,313
Your son's on that roof again.

2
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:35,912
If he did what I told him

3
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,354
he wouldn't make
a very good preacher's kid, now would he?

4
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,859
Daddy, they're here,
and momma says you'd better behave.

5
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,487
Showtime.

6
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,777
It's a privilege and an honor,
as mayor of this great city,

7
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:05,206
to do my part in linking arms
with people from all walks of life.

8
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:09,679
<i>The city needs strategic partnerships with
churches like Second Chance and The Rock,</i>

9
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:12,216
and we need strong advocates
for the inner city,

10
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,624
- like my friend Reverend Jenkins here.
- And how do you know Reverend Jenkins?

11
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,196
I first met Jerry at an integrated jail cell.

12
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:21,823
We were both arrested in 1960
at a lunch counter sit-in.

13
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:25,965
Now when I want a restaurant shut down,
I just call the health department.

14
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,640
- Two scoop.
- Sorry, I was told to give one.

15
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:37,807
- Jake always give me two scoop.
- Tiki, you bothering the help?

16
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,115
It's cool.

17
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,045
So, I hear you're getting groomed
to take the old man's place.

18
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,124
Yep. When the time comes.

19
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:49,152
You got the shoes for it.
What are those, Gucci?

20
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,919
Come on, folks. Keep it moving.

21
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,186
Oops.

22
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:55,563
- Sorry about that.
- My lucky tie. It's ruined.

23
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:59,062
I'm sorry. Look, there's more napkins
down by the silverware, okay?

24
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,573
And I've got a job interview today.
I might as well not even go now.

25
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,237
<i>Here.</i>

26
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,878
Take mine. Take it.

27
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,819
Hey, it better be lucky.

28
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:18,323
Have time to answer a few questions
before we pack up?

29
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,257
- Hey, Jake can you cover me?
- Got you covered.

30
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,428
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

31
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:25,588
<i>I know your suburban church
is pouring resources into this area,</i>

32
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:28,292
yet crime and unemployment remain high.

33
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:29,901
<i>Well, like my friend the mayor said,</i>

34
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:32,699
<i>our partnership with the inner city
is for the long haul.</i>

35
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,569
<i>You know, I'm proud
of what we've accomplished so far.</i>

36
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:38,610
<i>But if you want an insider's perspective,</i>

37
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,105
- Pastor Jake's the man.
- Pastor, care to comment?

38
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,546
Are you talking about
helping-rich-white-folks-sleep-at-night

39
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:46,880
kind of difference?

40
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,977
That's what these cameras are for, right?

41
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,989
Meanwhile, our mayor's idea
of urban renewal

42
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:55,822
is building baseball stadiums
so poor people can sell the peanuts.

43
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,522
Maybe if he went back to kissing babies
instead of kissing corporations

44
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,156
on their big, fat self-serving...

45
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,997
As far as crime and unemployment
are concerned,

46
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,536
the statistics are showing improvement.

47
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:09,267
But the real bottom line for us
is meeting people's needs.

48
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:11,809
- Isn't that right, honey?
- That's right, honey.

49
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,828
The Second Chance video runs
during the choir number.

50
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:32,295
After that you got two minutes, max,
for the pledge cards.

51
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,798
- You cannot go overtime again.
- Pastor Ethan.

52
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,167
- Good morning, Parker.
- Hey.

53
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:39,932
Hey, how's it going?

54
00:05:43,376 --> 00:05:44,741
Here you go.

55
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:47,175
Okay, let me see a pledge card.

56
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,113
Let's let Pastor Jake make the pitch, okay?

57
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:55,187
Personally I'd love to, but
I got a lot of board members complaining

58
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:57,188
we're already spending too much money
down there, so...

59
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:01,249
- I think he'd be more effective.
- Ethan, this is television, all right?

60
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:04,056
The guy's a loose cannon.
We got him on the platform.

61
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,562
We don't need him in the pulpit.

62
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:13,397
<i>You are the source of my strength</i>

63
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:20,545
<i>You are the strength of my life</i>

64
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:27,409
<i>I lift my hands in total</i>

65
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:31,721
<i>Praise to you</i>

66
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,126
<i>Amen</i>

67
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,323
<i>Amen</i>

68
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,931
<i>Amen</i>

69
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,061
<i>Amen</i>

70
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,772
<i>Amen</i>

71
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,107
<i>Amen</i>

72
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,679
<i>Amen</i>

73
00:06:56,783 --> 00:07:00,014
<i>Amen</i>

74
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,779
<i>Who says church has to be boring? Amen?</i>

75
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,144
Amen!

76
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,520
- I love you.
- Love you.

77
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:43,518
<i>Thank you, Dad.</i>

78
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:51,563
<i>Yesterday my eyes were opened
to what goes on at our sister church.</i>

79
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:55,229
<i>Many of you all know my dad pastored
Second Chance when I was a little kid.</i>

80
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,469
<i>But I hadn't been down there
in nearly 20 years.</i>

81
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:01,445
<i>I could barely recognize
the old neighborhood.</i>

82
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,745
<i>Wasn't all hugs and smiles.
It was hard work, some grim reality.</i>

83
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:11,452
<i>I still think I got a little gravy on my loafers,
right where the penny used to go.</i>

84
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,457
<i>Well, it's a tough gig down there.</i>

85
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,155
<i>I got to see Jake in action last night,</i>

86
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,097
<i>and I'm here to tell you
he is the right man for the job.</i>

87
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,728
<i>You're going to get a chance to meet
Jake and Amanda after the service,</i>

88
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,068
<i>but right now,
let's give them a round of applause</i>

89
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,007
<i>for all the hard work they're doing
in the worst part of town.</i>

90
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,489
<i>Jake, we got all these pledge cards here.</i>

91
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,654
<i>Why don't you come up here and tell us
what we're investing in.</i>

92
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,339
<i>Thank you, Brother Ethan.</i>

93
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,836
<i>I've got a Q-tip in the car
if you want to clean those loafers.</i>

94
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:14,382
<i>This morning I was stuck at a stoplight
in my 'hood,</i>

95
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,150
<i>that would be neighborhood to you, sir.</i>

96
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:23,454
<i>This woman comes up holding
what looks like a baby wrapped in a blanket.</i>

97
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:28,259
<i>She's tapping at my window
asking for money,</i>

98
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,528
<i>and I know that baby is a plastic doll,
but she keeps tapping.</i>

99
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,076
<i>So finally, I give her a dollar
just to get rid of her.</i>

100
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,475
<i>James, Chapter 1, teaches us</i>

101
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,746
<i>to be doers of the word
and not hearers only.</i>

102
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:52,690
<i>Every year I feel like we come here
tapping on your window,</i>

103
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:55,255
<i>but our baby's real.</i>

104
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,430
<i>I'm not asking for your money.</i>

105
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:02,195
<i>I've got gifted children in my community</i>

106
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,363
<i>who need some hands-on guidance.</i>

107
00:10:06,505 --> 00:10:09,941
<i>My wife needs tutors to help women</i>

108
00:10:10,042 --> 00:10:12,943
<i>trying to escape the bonds of prostitution.</i>

109
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,441
<i>We need after-school supervisors,
Bible school teachers.</i>

110
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,391
<i>Hold these up so I can see them.</i>

111
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,592
<i>This is how we fix problems in America.</i>

112
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:39,134
<i>We roll down our windows,
toss out some money, and drive away.</i>

113
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:43,598
<i>So my message to you
on Second Chance Sunday is this,</i>

114
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,443
<i>if you aren't willing to come down
and get a little gravy on your shoes,</i>

115
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,842
<i>just keep your damn money.</i>

116
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,418
Nice work, Ethan.

117
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:12,867
<i>It's good to know
what's going on in our other areas.</i>

118
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,105
<i>And now if our ushers would come forward,</i>

119
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,006
<i>allowing us an opportunity for our giving.</i>

120
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,548
- This guy stuck his finger in our face.
- Let me...

121
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,676
- Let me finish.
- Where does he get off lecturing us?

122
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:31,245
All he is saying is that we need
to stop pretending and start participating.

123
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,848
We've been participating
for nearly $2 million

124
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,790
for the last 15 years and I'm tired of it.

125
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:37,556
All right, maybe
we should all take a breather.

126
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,563
Look, this is not about
repaving the parking lot.

127
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:42,793
- We're on the front page here.
- We all read the paper, Mike.

128
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,627
Look, what if we run a full-page ad?

129
00:11:44,737 --> 00:11:48,173
Reprint the headline at the top
and then beneath it in big letters:

130
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,141
"Fine, We Will."

131
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,607
- I think Mike's going to pay for that ad.
- Yeah.

132
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:59,151
Look, the point is we all want to
be good stewards of God's money.

133
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:02,015
And we're too big a church
to be defined by any one ministry.

134
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,885
But Second Chance isn't just any ministry.

135
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:09,892
It's our roots, and we probably haven't
paid them as much attention as we should.

136
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,465
Jeremiah, it's Ethan's fault
for giving him the pulpit.

137
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:17,599
Look, this keeps happening every Sunday.
He changes things around.

138
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,898
- It's driving the TV crew nuts.
- All right, slow down, Mike.

139
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,701
Yes, we are getting complaints
about Ethan's style,

140
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:23,968
about the music he chooses.

141
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,476
Let him play his music. He's a rock star.

142
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,945
But senior pastor? Not on my watch.

143
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,916
Hold on. So what if he is unconventional?
My family likes that.

144
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:36,385
I'm Ethan's biggest fan.
But, Jerry, you have got a global vision.

145
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,418
And it totally depends on grooming
a successor

146
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,459
that this whole church can get behind.

147
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,155
If Ethan's our man, he has got to learn
discipline and accountability.

148
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,265
Starting now.

149
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,493
I'll talk to him.

150
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,700
He needs more than a sermon, Jerry.
He needs his wings clipped.

151
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,675
And if you don't do it, we will.

152
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:07,952
Jerry brought me here
on our first anniversary.

153
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,612
Some traditions die hard.

154
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:14,021
- I haven't seen Green Goddess in a while.
- I know.

155
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,119
- How's the house coming?
- Slow. They're still painting.

156
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,499
It's a little spooky staying there by myself,
but it's easier to supervise.

157
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,298
I just want it all done by the wedding.

158
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,428
Yeah. I think we need to hear
what Jake's saying, Dad.

159
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,906
I mean, get our hands dirty down there.

160
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,671
Send our high-schoolers
on a summer work project.

161
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,141
Well, it would be good
to have more of our staff involved.

162
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:39,684
Yeah. You know what,
send Aaron, the junior out pastor.

163
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,820
I hear he speaks Ebonics.

164
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,821
Wait a minute. You want me to go?
Is this a joke?

165
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,186
You can't be serious.

166
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,628
I'm the associate pastor, Dad,
I'm not a social worker.

167
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:56,462
- It'll be a good ministry experience.
- Jake's not going to listen to me.

168
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,532
You're not going there to fix anything, son.

169
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,435
I just want you to observe and to learn.

170
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,871
Look, I've been busting it for two years

171
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,670
to move this church into the 21st century.

172
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:07,644
Attendance is up, giving is up,
we've got the best music in town.

173
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,715
- None of that is going to change.
- My book just came out, Dad.

174
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,183
- Happy birthday, Mrs. Jenkins.
- Thank you, that's beautiful.

175
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:18,120
- Are you still working on that steak, Pastor?
- No, I think I'm finished.

176
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,489
- Was it well-done enough for you?
- It was delicious.

177
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:30,258
Son, you're blessed
with charisma, musical gifts.

178
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,101
You're a natural at the pulpit.

179
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,231
But there's more to being a pastor
than Sunday morning.

180
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:40,042
Yeah? Before you send me off
to be a glorified intern,

181
00:14:40,145 --> 00:14:42,613
I think you better check with the board first.

182
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,643
The board met this morning.

183
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,854
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- Happy birthday, Claudia.

184
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,460
Thank you.

185
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:06,766
- Well, you weren't very delicate.
- I was honest with him.

186
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:09,306
Oh, right, and the steak was delicious?

187
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,204
Make your wish.

188
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,594
Hey, baby! You want some action, baby?

189
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:37,028
- We got some money if you got the honey.
- Come take a ride with us, baby, come on!

190
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,384
<i>"And they grumbled against the boss,</i>

191
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:57,182
<i>"'These men who were hired last,
worked only one hour,</i>

192
00:15:57,856 --> 00:16:00,586
"'and you have made them equal to us

193
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,059
"'who have borne the burden of the work.'

194
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:10,293
"But he answered,

195
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:14,065
"'Friend, I am not being unfair to you.

196
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,334
"'Didn't you agree to work for a dollar?

197
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,945
"'Are you envious
because I am generous? So...

198
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:30,613
"'So the first will be last
and the last will be first."'

199
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:36,091
Gentlemen, do you understand
what this means?

200
00:16:36,462 --> 00:16:40,626
You may have lost some years to addictions.
You may have lost some years in prison.

201
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,701
You all know I did some time myself.

202
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:46,601
But the Word of God teaches us
that time can be redeemed.

203
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,067
Yeah, tell that to the chump who took
one look at my record

204
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,166
and said he wasn't hiring.

205
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:55,380
- All right, what did Jonesy just do?
- Blame the Man.

206
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,642
That's right. Blame the Man all day,

207
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,208
but what are you doing to show
that you're trustworthy and eager to work?

208
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:05,015
Tell us about this chump, Jonesy.
Did you shake his hand when you met him?

209
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,252
- He didn't give it.
- Did you look him in the eye?

210
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,156
Stand up, Jonesy.

211
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:16,033
Shake my hand.

212
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:23,504
Man, I got a wet sandwich here.
Come on. Look me in the eye.

213
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,842
Squeeze my hand, Jonesy.

214
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:27,468
You call that a squeeze?

215
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:38,721
I'm sorry, Pastor.

216
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:42,157
- Javier, you know what time it is?
- Yes, sir.

217
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,455
You come in half-dressed and late again.
What's the excuse this time?

218
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,556
- 'Cause the job was on the line?
- No excuses, Pastor.

219
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,794
I gave you three strikes.
I can't give you four.

220
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,102
<i>Hasta mañana, brother.</i>

221
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,245
Hey, Javier, wait a minute, man.
Let me walk you out.

222
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,508
- She took the kids.
- She did what?

223
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:08,245
She took the kids.

224
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:22,630
"Javier, I take the kids
and go back to El Paso.

225
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,994
"You make too many broken promises."

226
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:28,906
You want me to keep going?

227
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:33,676
She took the money we saved
and left me with nothing to follow.

228
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:37,315
My boys, they need their father.

229
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,049
It's all right.

230
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:51,928
It's gonna be all right, brother.

231
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,598
You looking for Amanda?

232
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,496
They're meeting downstairs.

233
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:17,013
I thought tonight was about job interviews.

234
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,483
But I believe God would have us
put our plans aside

235
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,094
and walk with our brother.

236
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,789
Hold on.

237
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:30,425
We need to talk.

238
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:36,067
Wait in my office.

239
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:44,875
Let's gather around our brother
and pray for him.

240
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,082
Do we need him in the room?

241
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:59,094
I'm sorry, gentlemen. This is Pastor Ethan,
visiting with us from The Rock.

242
00:20:00,566 --> 00:20:02,329
I thought they already did that.

243
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:07,871
Pastor Ethan, we'd be privileged
to have you lead us in prayer.

244
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,467
Sure.

245
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:17,946
Let's pray.

246
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:22,450
"Father, I want to thank you
for the new start that only you can give.

247
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,820
"And for this group of men
who have come together

248
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,255
"who want to serve you with their lives.

249
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,587
"I especially want to lift up our brother..."

250
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,519
Our brother...

251
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:33,853
Javier.

252
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,764
Our brother Gabriel.

253
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:40,131
"Lord, You know us
better than we know ourselves."

254
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:42,765
Back, back!

255
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,605
- Green light.
- Red light!

256
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,806
Back.

257
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:50,773
- Green light!
- Red light!

258
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:53,976
- Back!
- Brownies, brownies, brownies, everybody.

259
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:57,485
Payton, one brownie.

260
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,859
Something I could do for you, honey?

261
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:06,260
- You let your kids play with them?
- Sure. They love it here.

262
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:12,061
- I got a kid. A girl.
- Well, you bring her. You're both welcome.

263
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,569
No, I ain't seen her in a while.

264
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:19,637
- Well, what's her name?
- Kenya, like the country.

265
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:21,977
Beautiful.

266
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:25,645
- What's your name?
- You know, I'm gonna get her back.

267
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:32,049
A child should be with her mother.
You want a cup of tea?

268
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:36,923
- No, I just need some money.
- We don't give out cash, honey.

269
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,188
A smart girl like you knows that.

270
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,926
Yeah, well, you can't buy gas without it.
Smart woman like you knows that.

271
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,797
- Amen.
- Strengthen our brother, Lord.

272
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,269
Amen.

273
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,270
- Empower him, Lord.
- Yes.

274
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:53,041
Lord, we all need a helping hand
from time to time,

275
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:56,080
and I want Javier to know,

276
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,741
I'm claiming this Powerball number
in your name.

277
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,846
8-10-11-18-25-40.

278
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:08,323
You sprinkle your power on that number,
Lord, and I'm giving you 15%.

279
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,859
Now, I know the Bible says 10,
but it's a big pot,

280
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,295
and I'm going to use it to fly Javier
to El Paso so he...

281
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,765
- Amen.
- Amen.

282
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,636
We'll see most of you all at the Habitat build

283
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,174
and if anybody wants coffee,
Jonesy's buying.

284
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,332
Huh?

285
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:26,570
You got enough money for Powerball,

286
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,943
you got enough money
to buy your friends some coffee.

287
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,679
All right, all right.

288
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:36,178
Payton, get down.

289
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:38,884
I told you.

290
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:41,555
How far along are you?

291
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:48,555
- He's gonna kill me.
- We have a room here for you.

292
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:53,535
- Nah, I can't.
- Come on, let me make you that cup of tea.

293
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,471
Come on.

294
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:08,175
You got away pretty quick
after Sunday service.

295
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,720
Big building.
Didn't want to get lost in the crowd.

296
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,086
Oh, I would have been happy to tell you
where to go.

297
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,522
Exit's that way.

298
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:22,097
Look, I gave you my pulpit time televised
and you use it to start a fight.

299
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,797
Now I got the whole church mad at me

300
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:28,066
like I'm the one who wrote
your "get whitey" speech.

301
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:31,538
They called a board meeting, Jake.
I wasn't invited.

302
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,837
That makes two of us.

303
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,381
Hey, hold up. This isn't funny.

304
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:43,044
Your little rant could have cost me my job.

305
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:46,886
Oh. So it's about the job.
Well, cheer up, Gucci,

306
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:50,786
I hear you're in pretty tight with the pastor.

307
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:57,232
You're pretty cocky for a guy whose salary
gets approved by the same board.

308
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,170
Are you listening to me?

309
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:03,265
Are you listening to me?

310
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,774
Yours to keep, man.

311
00:24:05,477 --> 00:24:08,969
- Hey, I'm talking to you!
- Oh, is that your preacher voice?

312
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,911
I think he's coming.

313
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:19,554
- Listen, Jake. Hey, I'm on your side, okay?
- Look, Gucci, what do you want from me?

314
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,724
Well, you know what,
you could start by saying "I'm sorry."

315
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,426
All right.

316
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:33,736
I'm sorry for associate pastors
who got this all figured out

317
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,535
'cause they spent an hour down here
slinging potatoes.

318
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,400
I'm sorry for rock stars who think

319
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,410
they've lived
the African-American experience

320
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,309
riding a tour bus with Tina Turner.

321
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:45,815
And I'm sorry for "whiteys"
who try and get their conscience fixed

322
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:46,906
by coming down here

323
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:50,181
and hanging with their homeboys
in the ghetto once a year.

324
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:52,487
How's that?

325
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,259
You're the most self-righteous...

326
00:25:03,268 --> 00:25:05,099
I'll see you tomorrow.

327
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,540
What do you mean, "see you tomorrow"?
What do you mean, "see you tomorrow"?

328
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,687
Self-righteous? Self-righteous.

329
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:29,187
- Who's your friend?
- This is Julius.

330
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,058
You gonna read that?

331
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,201
What you looking at him for?
He ain't gonna read it for you.

332
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,738
He wants out.

333
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:47,570
Did you tell him how you got out?

334
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:52,680
- He doesn't have family out of town.
- No parents, grandparents?

335
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:57,711
- My brother's the only family I got.
- Maybe he'll bend the rules for you.

336
00:25:57,923 --> 00:26:01,290
He didn't bend them when I got in.
They beat the hell out of me.

337
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:06,227
It's a free-for-all, Jake. And it's worse
going out then it is coming in.

338
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:10,266
Your brother's got it all jacked up, kid.
Ain't even a real game.

339
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:12,000
Where do they come up with this stuff?

340
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:14,765
Man, last year two of my crew got dumped
at the hospital.

341
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,273
- One came out in a Ziploc.
- You preached the funeral.

342
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,335
Yeah, I did.

343
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,275
I don't want to be preaching another.

344
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,820
My momma brought me to hear
Dr. Martin Luther King

345
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,622
speak in this very church in 1967.

346
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,826
I was nine years old.

347
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,399
And I'll never forget what he did,
right here on this very spot,

348
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,162
when I held my hand out to him
after the service.

349
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:48,170
Here, put out your hand like you're me.

350
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,804
He shook it just like that.

351
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:56,178
Toilet in the men's room is running.
Might be the chain.

352
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,476
Costing us money. Got to fix that.

353
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,242
Good man, Sonny.

354
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,051
How many "I's" in traveling?

355
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:09,352
- Looks right to me.
- Nah, I think it's only one.

356
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,359
Maybe it's one of those words
spelled both ways.

357
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:13,225
- It can't be.
- Look it up.

358
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,195
Don't have to look it up.

359
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,329
So. Got a call from Jeremiah this morning.

360
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:23,600
Says you're here for a while
to observe and learn.

361
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,005
Yeah, whatever that means.

362
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,102
Hey, look, this is just as awkward for me
as it is for you, okay?

363
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,477
- Since we both got bosses, just...
- No, I got a boss.

364
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:33,449
- You got a daddy.
- Just show me to my office.

365
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:35,143
You want to see your office?

366
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:41,956
Follow me.

367
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,843
So I just imagined your raised eyebrow
when I locked my car?

368
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:11,387
Projection, my man.

369
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,923
But if you got a guilty conscience,
why you driving it?

370
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,391
I don't have a guilty conscience.

371
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,966
We got some sack lunches
at the park at noon.

372
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,700
What are you doing?

373
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,313
The last thing you want to do is

374
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:41,647
make people feel like
you're talking down to them.

375
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,415
Which is why we ask the staff
to voluntarily avoid

376
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,685
- displays of conspicuous consumption.
- Like my car.

377
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,919
Look, if you want me to take the bus,
just say it, okay?

378
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,861
Easy, Gucci.
You the one that brought this up.

379
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,021
Drive what you want.

380
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:57,363
You ain't gonna be here long enough
to learn the bus schedules, now are you?

381
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,697
A little help here, Hobart.

382
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,591
- What's going on up there? Is that a fire?
- No, no.

383
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:34,430
They're at it again, Pastor. You smell that?

384
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:38,574
I got a call from social services.
There's a duplex coming up next week.

385
00:29:39,644 --> 00:29:43,102
Oh, Ethan, this is Tamela.
Tamela, this is a white man.

386
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,443
- Is this hazelnut?
- Don't be changing the subject.

387
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:47,915
You got to stop them up there.

388
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:51,978
Between my chemicals and their campfires,
we could all blow up.

389
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:54,988
All right.

390
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,129
We're going in.

391
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,637
Hope we don't catch
one of them back drafts.

392
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:20,911
Fire marshal.

393
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,383
Open up.

394
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,029
Honey, will you let me in?

395
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:38,997
Thank you, sweetie.

396
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,209
Kali, you barbecuing again?

397
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:52,049
How many times I tell you,
there's no ventilation in here.

398
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,282
Use the stove.

399
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,953
- Goat no good on stove.
- Goat?

400
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:00,420
Where did you find goat around here?

401
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:03,957
They gonna burn this place down.

402
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:10,696
Ask your daddy why he's not at work.

403
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,105
He said no good job for a professor.

404
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:25,106
Did you hear that?

405
00:31:26,584 --> 00:31:30,816
Well, you tell the professor that
unless he's got a better offer from Harvard,

406
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:34,790
he needs to get back down to Wal-Mart
and start wrangling those shopping carts.

407
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:37,322
Tell him.

408
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:39,553
Is that you?

409
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:40,824
Tell him.

410
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,898
Oh, very pretty.

411
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:55,175
The soldiers come. They shoot us.

412
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:59,915
You got to make him understand, Kali.
The well's gonna run dry.

413
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:22,161
Bags too heavy? Arms getting tired?

414
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,202
- I got them.
- Then how about a smile, huh?

415
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:28,973
God loves a cheerful giver.
Tiki, where you going? Got your lunch.

416
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,671
I'm full, man. Salisbury steak.

417
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,276
That's our spot.

418
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,611
Been here every Wednesday for eight years.

419
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:40,891
I'm...

420
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,850
needing some money
to pick up my stomach medicine.

421
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,121
I'll pay you back on Friday.

422
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,306
Would you like something to eat?

423
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:02,209
Just set your belongings over there
and join us for a hot meal, okay?

424
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,708
You see, Sister, we brought
these sandwiches from the church...

425
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,148
Sandwiches.

426
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,952
- I see everyone get a bag.
- Sister, those are...

427
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,185
Never mind.

428
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,660
They've even got music.

429
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,590
I'm needing some real food.

430
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,490
Are you aware that family
almost got murdered in Africa?

431
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,325
Escaped with the clothes on their back.

432
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,456
And you'd really kick them out

433
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,695
because the dad doesn't want to collect
shopping carts.

434
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:00,828
Yep.

435
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,232
The guys like Tiki get a free meal
any time they show up?

436
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:12,045
Well, it's nice they can count on you
to feed them once they're on the street.

437
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,308
- I'll have the usual.
- What do you get here?

438
00:34:16,487 --> 00:34:17,886
Make it two.

439
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,230
Is that...

440
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:27,964
Is that you?

441
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,262
- You played pro ball?
- Yeah.

442
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:36,069
Lasted two playoff-free seasons.
Till coach started making us pee in cups.

443
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,671
Hey, Gucci, you ever see an Eskimo pee?

444
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:47,075
Yeah, that's when I did
my eight months for possession.

445
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:51,783
- I didn't know any L.A. Lawyers.
- Oh, come on, Jake.

446
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:55,585
Maybe I didn't do hard time
but I didn't get off.

447
00:34:55,726 --> 00:34:57,284
Everyone thinks court-ordered rehab

448
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,421
is like going to a resort
to hang out with celebrities.

449
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:01,964
But it's not.

450
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:23,776
So, I hear your dad's franchising himself
all over these days.

451
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:28,054
Nairobi, Bombay.

452
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,658
What, has The Rock finally gotten
too small for him?

453
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,354
What's that supposed to mean?

454
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:37,792
It's just that he's always flying off
to preach somewhere.

455
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:43,898
- You're missing the vitamins.
- I believe it's called the Great Commission.

456
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:46,533
Do you know how many converts
we've had in Africa alone?

457
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,044
It ain't a ball game, Gucci.
Nobody's keeping score.

458
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,206
We're sending ministry teams
all around the world.

459
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,681
- Doctors, teachers...
- It's all good.

460
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,945
I just think the home front
should take priority. That's all.

461
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,022
You mean your home front.

462
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,686
Back when your dad first hired me
as youth pastor,

463
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:08,061
we were more than a team. We were family.

464
00:36:08,766 --> 00:36:11,599
Then he goes off to the suburbs
to preach to...

465
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,436
The rich white people
without a care in the world, right?

466
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,003
Try some bread.

467
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,218
Eskimo pee.

468
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:43,458
Yeah, I was born here, but man,
it's like night and day.

469
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:47,031
30% unemployment. Babies having babies.

470
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:50,030
Half these kids won't graduate
from high school.

471
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,335
What up, holmes?

472
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,606
- All right, who's getting it today?
- Me, me, me.

473
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,374
- Come on, PJ. Keep it going.
- Yeah, that's it. Keep it going.

474
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:00,211
Come on. Come on. Keep it going.
Keep it going. That's it. That's it.

475
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,718
Pass it on, pass it on. Take it. Take it.

476
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,921
- Come on, Coach.
- Pass it on. Pass it on.

477
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,892
Hey, Julius.

478
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:23,105
Hey, Julius.

479
00:37:26,177 --> 00:37:27,644
Hey, Julius.

480
00:37:29,547 --> 00:37:31,879
- What's up?
- Hey, I got to go, Pastor.

481
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,147
Hey! Wait!

482
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,499
Jamal, you keeping things proper?

483
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,474
Julius, tell your brother
I asked him a question.

484
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:04,672
Yeah.

485
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:08,774
- Julius tell you he wants out?
- He know how to get out.

486
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:10,445
Yeah.

487
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:13,616
He tell you I'm through
burying your ex-mules?

488
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,795
Gangster, I'm talking to you.

489
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:24,795
Man, look, my 'hood, my rules,

490
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:27,871
my nigga.

491
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,104
Back up.

492
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,970
You see that cross
over on top of that church steeple?

493
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:38,810
- You see it?
- I see it.

494
00:38:38,916 --> 00:38:41,146
You look good,
'cause anywhere in this neighborhood

495
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,049
you see that cross is my 'hood.

496
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,851
- And my rules say slavery is over.
- You can't bend rules for family.

497
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:49,585
Yeah, then how about I bend your arm
over your head?

498
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,519
Jake, you're going to break his arm.

499
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,226
Now,

500
00:38:59,937 --> 00:39:02,929
I'm going to give you some time
to pray about this.

501
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,009
And if I don't like your answer,

502
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,841
then I'm gonna open up a can
of the wrath of God all over your sorry ass.

503
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:30,930
What was that?
And what's this wrath of God stuff?

504
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,930
Ever hear of "What would Jesus do?"

505
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,527
Tell me again why you're here.

506
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,334
Jake, you just can't go around threatening
one guy

507
00:39:37,441 --> 00:39:41,104
and then throwing a drunk back his bottle.
I mean, it's not consistent.

508
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,840
Answer the question. Why are you here?

509
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,147
To observe and learn.

510
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:49,845
Do you always observe
with your mouth open?

511
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:54,324
- All right. You made your point.
- No, I don't think I have.

512
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:57,191
Sit. Sit.

513
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,609
Back when I was on lock,

514
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:16,535
every day on my way to the yard,
I walked by the chapel.

515
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:19,581
Comfortable chairs, coffee pot,

516
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,748
and there sat the chapel
waiting for customers.

517
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,081
I never went once.

518
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,021
Then along came your dad
and his prison ministry.

519
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:31,617
Met me on my turf.
Wanted to know my story.

520
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:34,355
Gave me a chance after I got out.

521
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,932
He couldn't have done that preaching
from a stadium or on TV

522
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:41,266
or even from the pulpit
of a rundown old sanctuary.

523
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,735
He did that by walking the streets
and listening.

524
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:54,912
That's my car.

525
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,369
- Is there a switch inside?
- It's locked, Jake.

526
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,301
Not anymore.

527
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:33,921
You see who did this?
You see who did this?

528
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,487
Yeah, I want to report a crime.

529
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:43,328
Yeah, my brown leather jacket,
my golf clubs.

530
00:41:43,434 --> 00:41:45,629
- Jake, where are we?
- You calling 911?

531
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,363
Tell her where we are.

532
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:50,797
What are you doing?

533
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:53,206
Man, your insurance check will get here
before the cops.

534
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,768
- Let me get you a cup of coffee.
- What am I supposed to do with my car?

535
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,577
Do you sell windows?

536
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:03,849
- I'm calling the auto club.
- Suit yourself.

537
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:07,056
Watch the man's car till the truck gets here.

538
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,092
What?

539
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:13,794
- You know what, you're crazy.
- You're right. You figure it out.

540
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:22,965
I don't care who bought it, I don't care
what your classmates are wearing,

541
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:24,836
I don't care
if everybody came to school naked.

542
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:27,672
- You ain't going out dressed like that.
- I'll wear what I want.

543
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:29,609
Excuse me,
you take yourself back up to your room

544
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,941
and you put something over that.

545
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,107
I didn't wear nothing
you didn't used to wear.

546
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,208
I am your mother, don't talk to me like that.

547
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,787
I ain't had a mother my whole life.

548
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:46,789
Trina?

549
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,736
Trina, why are you here?

550
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,036
My baby.

551
00:42:59,677 --> 00:43:01,941
Judge got to give me back my baby.

552
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,205
Well, then, you got to be ready

553
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:07,273
'cause it's going to be a whole lot tougher
getting back your daughter's respect.

554
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,857
Mommy, I want to do that again.
I can do it better.

555
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,030
- Next time.
- Okay.

556
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,599
Everybody, let's just take a break.

557
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,962
Come on.

558
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,168
No, I want to pick out the china pattern
with you.

559
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,834
I just don't know how long
this is gonna take

560
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,469
and I'm probably going to need to get
a rental car.

561
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:41,344
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

562
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,811
No, I think it was gunfire.

563
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:46,754
And forget china,
I want to pick out a flak jacket.

564
00:43:47,891 --> 00:43:49,825
Honey, it's just a joke.

565
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:53,190
Look, I'll call you
when the truck gets here, okay?

566
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,356
All right. Love you, too.

567
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:00,870
You like that one?

568
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:05,805
So they were cooking goat?
You ever try goat?

569
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:09,905
- It's like eating rubber bands.
- How would you know?

570
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,974
- Ethan, I raised them when I was a kid.
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

571
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:16,450
This is called "Butterfly Garden."

572
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,544
- It's a little too busy.
- Yes.

573
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,155
I want you to be safe down there.

574
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,955
It's not that bad. It's just really different.

575
00:44:26,063 --> 00:44:29,499
Royal Cambridge has just come out
with this coronation re-issue.

576
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,261
Quite beautiful, isn't it?

577
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:35,029
- No.
- No.

578
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:38,606
This is a sample that just came in Monday.

579
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:40,869
Hand-painted in Budapest.

580
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:44,714
- Absolutely exquisite.
- That's lovely.

581
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,578
- How much?
- $350 per setting.

582
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:52,645
We got to let our rich friends
buy us something.

583
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:56,286
- Sorry.
- That's okay. Can I see the other pieces?

584
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:57,724
Absolutely.

585
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:01,863
Think about this in our dining room.

586
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:04,490
Do you still have those paint chips
in your wallet?

587
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:11,772
What's that?

588
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,240
Here we are.

589
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,746
I think we're gonna keep looking.

590
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,981
- Really.
- Thanks for your help.

591
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:25,112
- Of course.
- I'll pull the car up.

592
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,622
- I'm sorry. Thank you.
- Good luck.

593
00:45:28,258 --> 00:45:29,418
Ethan?

594
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:18,007
I need one coffee and a glazed donut.

595
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,117
And I'll take one lottery ticket.

596
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,624
Thank you.

597
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:46,700
Hey, guys.
Remember me from the men's group?

598
00:46:47,171 --> 00:46:51,130
- I know who you are.
- You're Jonesy, you're Javier.

599
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,975
Oh, good donut.

600
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,111
You make this?

601
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:07,886
Hey, see you later, buddy.

602
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:13,058
Javier, hang on.
Look, I know about your situation.

603
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,225
I'd like to help you out.

604
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:18,867
Look, I want you to take this.

605
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:22,605
I want you to use this to get your family
back from El Paso.

606
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:25,539
Take it. Your kids need their dad.

607
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,870
<i>- Take it, please.
- Gracias.</i>

608
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:31,114
Bless you.

609
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,286
Hey, I don't know
if that was such a good idea.

610
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:42,619
Why not?

611
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:45,957
Well, you don't want to give junkies
a wad of cash.

612
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:53,432
- You mean he's doing?
- He's been clean six months, I think.

613
00:47:58,442 --> 00:48:02,469
- Coffee's hot.
- Hey, maybe it's a test from God, huh?

614
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:09,509
Look. I bought you this.

615
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:15,516
- I thought you was a pastor.
- I am.

616
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,519
- I just want you to have it.
- Pastor Jake know about this?

617
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:28,231
It'll be our secret.
You let me know if you hit the jackpot.

618
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:35,769
You know, I got myself
a job interview today.

619
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,505
I just don't want to jinx it.

620
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:52,785
Right. All right, Kali,
remember to follow through, okay?

621
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:01,531
Someone want to tell me what's so funny?

622
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,598
I want 10 laps.

623
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:10,537
Yo, Globetrotter, count them down
and lock up, will you?

624
00:49:11,181 --> 00:49:13,547
Let's go, 10 laps. Let's go!

625
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:17,745
Kali, you don't need to run the laps, okay?

626
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,654
Nine more, let's go!

627
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:25,893
Let's go, guys. Come on, keep it up.

628
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,122
Keep going. Nine more!

629
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,759
Kali, wait up.

630
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:36,837
Hey, wait up. Hey, look,
hey, you didn't do anything wrong.

631
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:41,235
How's your family?
Is your dad still working at Wal-Mart?

632
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,374
Has he got a new job?

633
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,944
Hey, Kali.

634
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,115
Never mind.

635
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:18,304
Well? What do you think?

636
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,076
Nice images. It's colorful.

637
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,084
It just doesn't...

638
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:28,456
It makes us look like a country club.

639
00:50:28,558 --> 00:50:31,049
I mean, there's no mention
of our inner-city ministries,

640
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:34,221
- nothing about what we're doing overseas.
- Go on.

641
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:36,964
You know what, maybe it's because
I've been gone for two weeks,

642
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,331
but it's just... It's not real.

643
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,126
And why aren't you in it?

644
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:43,468
Parker thought
it shouldn't be personality driven.

645
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,837
Well, Parker's wrong, as usual.

646
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:51,306
Open up the Africa bin
and pull up that shot with dad and the kids.

647
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:57,881
You see this? You're a personality, Dad.

648
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,284
God uses personalities.

649
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,381
Name one preacher
who isn't bigger than life,

650
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:04,221
who doesn't have a little rock star in him.

651
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:06,921
Jake's sure got it. He learned it from you.

652
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:13,996
Hey, pull up that shot of Jake and me
at the homeless lunch.

653
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:17,905
Yeah, go back.

654
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,510
Yeah, slow it down about 50%.

655
00:51:21,678 --> 00:51:22,906
Go back, yeah.

656
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,487
Yeah.

657
00:51:31,256 --> 00:51:33,417
Got to go, Dad. Late for work.

658
00:51:55,247 --> 00:51:57,909
Well, I figure we're gonna need
a couple of blocks on the other side

659
00:51:58,016 --> 00:51:59,483
- for a cloverleaf.
- Look at that.

660
00:51:59,584 --> 00:52:01,916
They're practically on church property.

661
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:06,248
This area needs a clean sweep.
It's like Baltimore, right?

662
00:52:06,358 --> 00:52:08,690
Camden Yard goes up, crime goes down.

663
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,988
And the Orioles still can't win.

664
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:25,533
Hey, just in time.
I need 20 bucks to get my medicine.

665
00:52:26,478 --> 00:52:28,446
I saved you the last roast beef, all right?

666
00:52:28,547 --> 00:52:30,105
I'm not giving you cash.

667
00:52:30,215 --> 00:52:33,150
You need medicine,
I'll walk you to the drugstore.

668
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:35,679
I like you.

669
00:52:35,787 --> 00:52:40,349
First time I saw you I thought you
were a chump loser. You're all right.

670
00:52:43,995 --> 00:52:45,895
I'm still not giving you cash.

671
00:52:50,702 --> 00:52:53,637
Well, I think I'm going to need
a couple more weeks

672
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:57,105
- to sell this to my board.
- What? This is a favor, Parker.

673
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:59,938
A favor to you and your church.
If it's going to be controversial...

674
00:53:00,045 --> 00:53:03,947
- No, no, no. I'm just building consensus.
- Consensus, my ass.

675
00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:05,949
I've got councilmen pushing alternate sites.

676
00:53:06,051 --> 00:53:08,747
You guaranteed me a no-hassle transition.

677
00:53:09,688 --> 00:53:11,383
May I help you gentlemen?

678
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:16,355
- Hey! Ethan, right?
- Mayor Long, good to see you.

679
00:53:16,461 --> 00:53:19,123
Yeah, good to see you.
What have you got there?

680
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:22,929
Well, I got a little bologna, deviled ham...

681
00:53:24,002 --> 00:53:26,232
I'm hearing good stuff
about what you're doing down here.

682
00:53:26,338 --> 00:53:27,896
Really. From who?

683
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:33,035
So, how are you getting along with Jake?

684
00:53:33,144 --> 00:53:36,011
Well, he's got his basketball clinic going on.

685
00:53:36,114 --> 00:53:38,048
Want to suit up, Parker?
A little one-on-one?

686
00:53:38,149 --> 00:53:40,208
No, no, no. You guys are out of my league.

687
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:41,808
Hey, good to see you.

688
00:53:53,832 --> 00:53:56,596
Trina! Trina, you need to slow down.

689
00:53:57,168 --> 00:53:59,033
Trina, let's talk about this.

690
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:01,934
Why are you in my face? I am not your kid!

691
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,338
You need to think about
what you're doing here.

692
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:06,637
But he's taking me shopping, all right?
He's even buying lunch.

693
00:54:06,745 --> 00:54:09,043
The only reason that Buster is here
is to buy your abortion

694
00:54:09,147 --> 00:54:11,115
and put you back on the street.

695
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:13,547
Hey, we are having a conversation!

696
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:15,508
Trina!

697
00:54:21,126 --> 00:54:24,289
Trina. Trina, he is lying to you!

698
00:54:33,638 --> 00:54:35,401
I don't know how you do it.

699
00:54:36,775 --> 00:54:38,265
One girl at a time.

700
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:42,070
Yeah, but how many really turn around?

701
00:54:47,152 --> 00:54:48,710
You're looking at one.

702
00:54:52,557 --> 00:54:55,924
Watch your opponent.
Find his weakness and exploit it.

703
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:04,368
- It looks easy.
- That's the way I could be going.

704
00:55:07,038 --> 00:55:10,201
Wear your opponent down
with aggressive moves.

705
00:55:14,813 --> 00:55:18,374
Now, why'd I go for the lay-up?
Why not the slam-dunk?

706
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:21,452
- 'Cause it ain't showbiz.
- That's right. It ain't showbiz.

707
00:55:21,553 --> 00:55:23,453
Your team's counting on you
to sink the points.

708
00:55:23,555 --> 00:55:26,353
You don't get any extra points
by being a showoff.

709
00:55:28,293 --> 00:55:30,386
Don't let him drive to the basket.

710
00:55:33,698 --> 00:55:36,963
- Larry Bird.
- Larry Bird.

711
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:41,337
Now, when your opponent has the ball,
where's your focus?

712
00:55:41,439 --> 00:55:42,906
- The ball?
- Wrong. Where's your focus?

713
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:46,670
- His hands.
- Wrong again. His eyes. You lock eyes.

714
00:55:46,778 --> 00:55:49,440
Eyes will tell you everything
you need to know.

715
00:55:51,883 --> 00:55:53,407
Hey!

716
00:56:00,492 --> 00:56:02,619
All right, that's enough for today.

717
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,565
New shoes, Kali?

718
00:56:19,244 --> 00:56:22,042
- Something you want to tell me?
- What do you mean?

719
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:24,847
- Did you give him money?
- No. Why would you even say that?

720
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:26,610
I know about Javier.

721
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:30,614
- Look, I was just trying to help, okay?
- Yeah?

722
00:56:30,722 --> 00:56:33,987
Well, nobody's seen him for over a week,
including his boss.

723
00:56:34,292 --> 00:56:35,919
Well, how do you know he's not in El Paso?

724
00:56:36,027 --> 00:56:39,360
How do you know he's not strung out
under a bridge somewhere?

725
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:43,894
Let's get you a coat.

726
00:56:44,669 --> 00:56:47,399
<i>I'll point you to Jesus</i>

727
00:56:47,505 --> 00:56:50,440
<i>I'll point you to Jesus</i>

728
00:56:50,542 --> 00:56:53,443
<i>I'll point you to Jesus</i>

729
00:56:53,545 --> 00:56:56,708
<i>I'll point you to Jesus</i>

730
00:56:56,815 --> 00:56:59,841
<i>I'll point you to Jesus</i>

731
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:02,977
<i>To turn your darkness</i>

732
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:05,317
<i>Into day</i>

733
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:07,186
Good!

734
00:57:09,194 --> 00:57:11,355
Can I help you, Pastor Ethan?

735
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:13,219
I'm just listening.

736
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:17,028
We have plenty of empty seats up here.
Isn't that right, choir?

737
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,864
Come on over here, Pastor Ethan. Come on.

738
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:27,434
You know,
I remember when he was a little boy,

739
00:57:27,712 --> 00:57:29,441
he used to sit at this piano

740
00:57:29,547 --> 00:57:31,174
and in between services
he would play songs.

741
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:34,479
- Do you still play piano, Pastor Ethan?
- Little bit.

742
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:36,514
Well, praise the Lord!

743
00:57:36,621 --> 00:57:40,648
Come on over here and play for us
so I can conduct proper.

744
00:57:40,992 --> 00:57:41,959
Come on.

745
00:57:43,027 --> 00:57:44,824
Come on. Thank you.

746
00:57:46,364 --> 00:57:49,265
What is wrong with you all?
Come on now, get with it.

747
00:57:52,537 --> 00:57:54,437
<i>Pastor, do you know Follow Me?</i>

748
00:57:54,906 --> 00:57:55,873
Yeah.

749
00:57:56,608 --> 00:58:00,271
Well, I would like to do it up-tempo.
Can you set the tempo, please?

750
00:58:03,514 --> 00:58:04,640
Go ahead.

751
00:58:24,602 --> 00:58:28,163
<i>I have a friend indeed</i>

752
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,376
<i>One who supplies my every need</i>

753
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:38,447
<i>Follow me, I'll show you the way</i>

754
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:43,577
<i>To turn your darkness into day</i>

755
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:48,552
<i>He'll turn your darkness into day</i>

756
00:58:49,327 --> 00:58:51,659
I just don't know about this cat, baby.

757
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:54,164
He's not doing anything wrong.

758
00:58:54,265 --> 00:58:57,098
He's shown up every day for work
for two weeks.

759
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:59,066
He's done everything we asked him.

760
00:59:00,071 --> 00:59:04,235
Now if I could learn to stop cursing,
surely you could learn to use a computer.

761
00:59:04,342 --> 00:59:07,903
Yeah, well, you let me know when that
happens and I might let you buy me one.

762
00:59:08,012 --> 00:59:09,104
Keep going.

763
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:12,341
It's just that he's always got his eye
on the audience.

764
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:15,051
Whether he's giving away his necktie

765
00:59:15,153 --> 00:59:19,021
or letting somebody walk off with his jacket,
I just feel like he's waiting for applause.

766
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:21,887
Honey, he's a musician.
He's used to applause.

767
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:24,223
Well, we both know
he ain't gonna get it down here.

768
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:27,594
Soon as he figures that out,
like father, like son.

769
00:59:29,467 --> 00:59:30,695
You hear that?

770
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:34,098
What's going on out there?

771
00:59:34,439 --> 00:59:36,168
Sounds like music.

772
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:44,047
<i>- Follow me
- Follow me</i>

773
00:59:44,148 --> 00:59:46,616
<i>- Follow me

<i>- I'll point you to Jesus
- I'll point you to Jesus</i>

777
00:59:53,624 --> 00:59:54,591
<i>Yes, I will</i>

778
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:56,853
<i>- I'll point you to Jesus
- Point you to Jesus</i>

779
00:59:56,961 --> 00:59:59,191
<i>- I'll point you to Jesus
- And we'll go there</i>

780
00:59:59,297 --> 01:00:01,492
<i>- I'll point you to Jesus
- Yes, I will</i>

781
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,863
<i>- I'll point you to Jesus
- Yes, I will</i>

782
01:00:03,968 --> 01:00:06,459
<i>- I'll point you to Jesus

783
01:00:06,571 --> 01:00:09,062
<i>- I'll point you to Jesus

784
01:00:09,173 --> 01:00:12,574
<i>- I'll point you to Jesus

785
01:00:12,677 --> 01:00:15,111
<i>- Yes, I will

786
01:00:15,213 --> 01:00:18,046
<i>- I'll point you to Jesus
- Point you to Jesus</i>

787
01:00:18,149 --> 01:00:19,912
<i>Yes, I will, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

788
01:00:20,018 --> 01:00:23,385
<i>He'll turn your darkness into day</i>

789
01:00:23,488 --> 01:00:24,648
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

790
01:00:24,756 --> 01:00:27,953
<i>- He'll turn your darkness into day
- Oh, yeah</i>

791
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:30,050
<i>Yeah</i>

792
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:33,789
<i>Yes, he will</i>

793
01:00:33,931 --> 01:00:35,956
<i>Yes, yeah!</i>

794
01:00:46,177 --> 01:00:48,771
That's a real gift you got there,
Pastor Ethan.

795
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:51,644
- Isn't that right, Pastor Jake?
- Yes, ma'am!

796
01:00:51,883 --> 01:00:54,443
The Music Man has come to River City.

797
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:56,619
See everybody on Sunday.

798
01:00:56,721 --> 01:00:59,690
Enjoy him while you can, Miss Burdoe,
he's just on loan.

799
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:01,622
Could be a fine match.

800
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:04,794
- Amen to that.
- Ask him.

801
01:01:05,596 --> 01:01:09,464
What are your future plans, Ethan?
Gonna be with us for a while?

802
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:12,797
'Cause we sure have seen enough
of those ghetto tourists down here.

803
01:01:12,904 --> 01:01:14,337
Haven't we, honey?

804
01:01:14,439 --> 01:01:18,205
Hanging around just long enough
to be able to tell their congregation,

805
01:01:18,543 --> 01:01:20,306
"I've been there."

806
01:01:20,411 --> 01:01:23,175
Miss Burdoe, let me walk you to your car.

807
01:01:25,583 --> 01:01:26,675
You behave.

808
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:32,719
Now, Pastor Jake,
don't be messing with my piano man.

809
01:01:38,329 --> 01:01:40,559
Is that how they teach teamwork
in the pros?

810
01:01:40,665 --> 01:01:42,394
Humiliate your teammates?

811
01:01:43,234 --> 01:01:44,223
Are you on my team?

812
01:01:44,335 --> 01:01:46,098
What do you think
I've been doing down here?

813
01:01:46,204 --> 01:01:50,436
- Passing out sandwiches, being ball boy?
- That's right. It's all good.

814
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:55,111
But you've got the look of a man
that's serving time. Are you on my team?

815
01:01:57,248 --> 01:02:00,684
I don't have the patience or the heart
to invest in you, Ethan.

816
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:04,951
'Cause I know you're gonna walk out on us.
Just like your old man did.

817
01:02:07,925 --> 01:02:09,688
Maybe it's time to go home.

818
01:02:30,948 --> 01:02:33,348
- He should have been here by now.
- Relax.

819
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,387
- Man, he ain't supposed to bring the crew.
- It's cool.

820
01:02:39,223 --> 01:02:42,351
- I got a bad feeling about this.
- I'm gonna be okay, man.

821
01:02:42,593 --> 01:02:44,584
Your brother and I got history.

822
01:02:45,163 --> 01:02:48,655
You made your decision.
He's just gonna have to respect it.

823
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:55,606
Tony.

824
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:58,634
Just stay out of sight, man. And pray.

825
01:03:43,087 --> 01:03:44,213
Pastor Jake!

826
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:48,557
- Where's Pastor Jake?
- He's not here. What's up?

827
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:50,092
I think they killed him.

828
01:04:04,408 --> 01:04:05,375
Tony.

829
01:04:13,251 --> 01:04:16,982
<i>Dr. Bruce, telephone, please.
Dr. Bruce, telephone.</i>

830
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:28,921
<i>Here at PayDay, we understand
how hard it is when there's an...</i>

831
01:04:36,807 --> 01:04:38,536
No, you didn't.

832
01:04:40,611 --> 01:04:42,203
You son of a...

833
01:05:01,899 --> 01:05:02,991
I'm coming.

834
01:05:08,539 --> 01:05:09,699
Hey.

835
01:05:10,274 --> 01:05:12,139
- What's going on?
- I'm okay.

836
01:05:12,243 --> 01:05:14,905
Hey, what's going...
Hey, what you got on your shirt?

837
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:17,105
- I'm okay.
- Ethan!

838
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:24,918
The doctor wanted him in overnight.

839
01:05:25,056 --> 01:05:28,583
And there was no way he wanted to go fight
those kids again.

840
01:05:31,595 --> 01:05:35,622
I mean, what 19-year-old do we know
who would take someone else's beating?

841
01:05:37,234 --> 01:05:38,258
Sorry.

842
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:40,860
What's that cash doing there?

843
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:43,337
It's $500 left over from the painters.

844
01:05:43,441 --> 01:05:46,103
- Can you re-deposit it for me?
- Write a check.

845
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:49,439
Write a check next time.

846
01:06:05,096 --> 01:06:07,291
Do you like it? It was going to be...

847
01:06:07,398 --> 01:06:09,457
Do we really need all this stuff?

848
01:06:09,934 --> 01:06:11,731
It was gonna be a surprise.

849
01:06:28,352 --> 01:06:31,515
Ethan, you picked this neighborhood.

850
01:06:32,323 --> 01:06:33,984
You designed this house.

851
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:38,487
I told you from the beginning
I didn't need any of this.

852
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:44,898
What's going on?

853
01:06:47,538 --> 01:06:49,438
He would've died for that kid.

854
01:06:51,742 --> 01:06:53,175
I couldn't do that.

855
01:07:04,255 --> 01:07:05,722
I think you could.

856
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:33,515
You and me taking the kids camping again.

857
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:35,545
That's right.

858
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:42,523
- You gonna go to the doctor?
- I've been to the doctor, Sonny.

859
01:07:43,494 --> 01:07:45,792
Well, maybe you should go back.

860
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:52,926
- Oh, sorry. Does it hurt?
- Yes, it hurts, Sonny.

861
01:07:53,437 --> 01:07:55,496
Hurts like hell, all right?

862
01:07:55,606 --> 01:07:57,733
God doesn't like it when you swear.

863
01:07:58,642 --> 01:08:01,634
Let's go. Anybody seen Julius?

864
01:08:07,718 --> 01:08:10,380
Hey, hey.
Start with the trash along the fence.

865
01:08:11,188 --> 01:08:12,416
Julius!

866
01:08:12,723 --> 01:08:15,248
Hey, man,
why you climbing in the backyard?

867
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:18,021
Don't you know we can come around
the front now?

868
01:08:18,963 --> 01:08:21,557
Guess you like doing things
the hard way, huh?

869
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:23,860
Young blood.

870
01:08:24,001 --> 01:08:25,025
What's up?

871
01:08:26,337 --> 01:08:28,999
Gonna get you
some of that great outdoors, huh?

872
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:37,041
...they got canoeing
and horseback riding

873
01:08:37,147 --> 01:08:41,550
and all kinds of games you can play,
and we can go for a hike or two.

874
01:08:42,586 --> 01:08:44,281
You should've called me.

875
01:08:44,555 --> 01:08:46,284
Well, he's out.

876
01:08:48,025 --> 01:08:50,493
Everybody's in. Let's go.

877
01:09:11,749 --> 01:09:13,410
All right, let's roll out!

878
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:17,587
Let's go.

879
01:10:11,909 --> 01:10:12,876
Kali.

880
01:10:22,186 --> 01:10:24,154
- What you got in your pocket?
- Nothing.

881
01:10:24,254 --> 01:10:25,312
Let's see.

882
01:10:32,096 --> 01:10:33,529
Let me see the bag.

883
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:39,735
Man, you been busy.

884
01:10:43,507 --> 01:10:44,633
What's this?

885
01:10:47,044 --> 01:10:48,636
Business is picking up.

886
01:11:03,794 --> 01:11:04,852
Follow me.

887
01:11:05,796 --> 01:11:08,924
All right, guys, pack it up,
go to the church, right now.

888
01:11:20,611 --> 01:11:22,579
Tell him how old you are, Kali.

889
01:11:24,248 --> 01:11:25,237
Go ahead.

890
01:11:25,983 --> 01:11:27,143
Seven.

891
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:30,109
What else you going to tell him?

892
01:11:30,854 --> 01:11:33,755
Remember? You're going to tell him,
"I quit."

893
01:11:34,091 --> 01:11:35,353
I quit.

894
01:11:35,459 --> 01:11:38,053
I don't think he heard you above the traffic.

895
01:11:38,829 --> 01:11:40,126
I quit.

896
01:11:40,631 --> 01:11:42,155
Get on back.

897
01:11:46,970 --> 01:11:49,598
- Yo, I want my ends.
- Your ends?

898
01:11:49,707 --> 01:11:51,800
You just made a contribution to feed

899
01:11:51,909 --> 01:11:55,037
about 80 of your less-privileged
brothers and sisters...

900
01:11:55,145 --> 01:11:56,112
Dude!

901
01:11:56,213 --> 01:11:58,147
Dude, why you always in my business, man?

902
01:11:58,248 --> 01:11:59,875
You don't know nothing about me

903
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:02,213
and you don't know nothing
about these streets.

904
01:12:04,722 --> 01:12:07,657
- Give him the money, Jake.
- Yo, the bridge is closed.

905
01:12:08,358 --> 01:12:10,656
Come on, Jake. Give him the money.

906
01:12:10,928 --> 01:12:14,955
That's right, shoot the white man
on the bridge during rush hour. Go ahead.

907
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:21,164
Check it out,

908
01:12:23,207 --> 01:12:24,231
$500.

909
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:26,309
Beat it, Gucci.
There ain't no cameras up here.

910
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:28,310
$500. Just let him go.

911
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:32,012
Check it out.

912
01:12:48,132 --> 01:12:51,124
Oh, Jake. Are you all right?
Let me help you up.

913
01:12:52,069 --> 01:12:53,934
- Let me help you up.
- Take it!

914
01:12:57,207 --> 01:13:00,370
- Let me help you.
- I said take it! Take the money.

915
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:06,772
You don't want my help?
You can keep your money.

916
01:13:14,258 --> 01:13:17,125
Albania and the Ukraine
will be operational in six months.

917
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:21,129
Nairobi will be in expansion of
our existing compound, same with Bombay.

918
01:13:21,465 --> 01:13:23,126
Seems like a lot to bite off.

919
01:13:23,233 --> 01:13:25,827
Well, to me
it seems like an answer to prayer.

920
01:13:25,969 --> 01:13:29,370
With the infusion of capital
that comes with the city's generous offer,

921
01:13:29,473 --> 01:13:31,998
we can fund these outreach centers
for five full years

922
01:13:32,109 --> 01:13:34,805
without touching
our regular operational budget.

923
01:13:35,245 --> 01:13:37,304
Can't we take a few more days
to pray about it?

924
01:13:37,414 --> 01:13:40,247
Well, we can take the rest of the year,
but unless the city has our yes

925
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:44,184
by 10:00 a.m. Tomorrow, they're gonna
move that stadium site across the river.

926
01:13:44,288 --> 01:13:46,779
Gentlemen, we knew this deadline
was coming.

927
01:13:47,424 --> 01:13:48,755
Now, I know this is difficult,

928
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:51,327
but we are not here
to make decisions based on emotion.

929
01:13:51,428 --> 01:13:54,420
"To whom much is given, much is required."

930
01:13:54,531 --> 01:13:58,433
And good stewardship requires us
to think about God's greater plan.

931
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:03,037
Now, if there's no more questions,
I move we bring this to a vote.

932
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:05,768
- Second.
- How can we even think of voting

933
01:14:05,876 --> 01:14:08,174
when the people this affects most
are not even here?

934
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:09,836
This is not their decision to make.

935
01:14:09,947 --> 01:14:12,245
Well, they're going to find out about it
sooner or later.

936
01:14:12,349 --> 01:14:13,976
You think they're just gonna stand by

937
01:14:14,084 --> 01:14:16,109
and let the city take
a wrecking ball to their church?

938
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:17,710
The city has eminent domain.

939
01:14:17,821 --> 01:14:19,846
They can do what they want,
with or without any of us.

940
01:14:19,957 --> 01:14:22,585
This way everyone benefits.
Including Second Chance.

941
01:14:22,693 --> 01:14:25,628
- So let them at least participate.
- Okay, look, look.

942
01:14:25,796 --> 01:14:27,593
I am with Parker on this, Todd.

943
01:14:27,698 --> 01:14:30,496
There is no sense in stirring anything up.

944
01:14:31,001 --> 01:14:33,060
We don't need any more headlines.

945
01:14:36,773 --> 01:14:37,967
All in favor?

946
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,785
Opposed?

947
01:15:00,464 --> 01:15:02,398
One opposed, two abstentions.

948
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:05,031
I don't abstain. I quit.

949
01:15:26,857 --> 01:15:29,223
Hey, Julius. It's a new day.

950
01:15:29,493 --> 01:15:31,984
- Thanks for everything.
- You got it.

951
01:15:35,766 --> 01:15:37,529
- Bye, Julius.
- Bye, Julius.

952
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:12,965
Yesterday, Sonny told me that he had
something on his heart

953
01:16:13,070 --> 01:16:15,334
he wanted to share at staff devotions.

954
01:16:16,873 --> 01:16:17,999
You ready?

955
01:16:28,185 --> 01:16:29,516
I've been reading,

956
01:16:30,854 --> 01:16:32,947
reading in my Bible

957
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:36,325
where Jesus did something special
for his friends,

958
01:16:37,394 --> 01:16:38,827
his best friends...

959
01:16:40,697 --> 01:16:41,664
Go on.

960
01:16:57,714 --> 01:16:59,807
Sonny, what are you doing?

961
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:03,010
- I need to ask forgiveness.
- What are you talking about?

962
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:06,417
Remember when you said it hurt like hell

963
01:17:07,324 --> 01:17:10,691
- and I said God don't like it when we swear?
- Yeah.

964
01:17:10,994 --> 01:17:13,485
I was more worried about you saying "hell"

965
01:17:13,597 --> 01:17:15,087
than about how you was feeling.

966
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:18,292
- Well, I shouldn't have said that, Sonny.
- I judged you.

967
01:17:18,435 --> 01:17:21,666
And I ain't ever been beat up like that.

968
01:17:33,283 --> 01:17:34,614
I love you, Tony.

969
01:17:36,253 --> 01:17:37,811
I love you too, Sonny.

970
01:17:39,222 --> 01:17:40,849
You're my best friend.

971
01:19:15,218 --> 01:19:17,516
- You pay for that?
- Huh?

972
01:19:19,222 --> 01:19:20,712
Did you pay for that?

973
01:19:41,011 --> 01:19:43,775
Hey, give me that backpack.

974
01:19:52,722 --> 01:19:54,189
You late for school.

975
01:20:12,776 --> 01:20:16,439
Hey, and I want to start seeing
some rent money from your sorry ass.

976
01:20:29,192 --> 01:20:30,659
You're not hungry this morning, Jake?

977
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,490
- No, just wondering why we're here.
- Honey.

978
01:20:35,732 --> 01:20:37,131
Well, Jake,

979
01:20:38,435 --> 01:20:40,630
over the past few years we've seen
the hand of God

980
01:20:40,737 --> 01:20:43,706
do some amazing things
at Second Chance and...

981
01:20:44,741 --> 01:20:47,141
Well, right now, if you'll all follow me,

982
01:20:47,611 --> 01:20:52,207
I would just like to share with you
an exciting new vision for your ministry.

983
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:57,882
We've doubled the seating capacity.

984
01:20:57,988 --> 01:20:59,580
We doubled the number of classrooms.

985
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:03,250
We got the new dorms for your women's
outreach with entirely separate entrances...

986
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,588
Where is the church?

987
01:21:04,694 --> 01:21:07,162
- Well, the sanctuary's here.
- No. Where's our church?

988
01:21:07,264 --> 01:21:09,095
This is a brand new campus, Jake.

989
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:12,726
It's on a piece of property
five miles north of our current structure.

990
01:21:12,836 --> 01:21:14,064
Check this out, Mrs. Sanders.

991
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:16,604
Right here in the center
of the educational wing,

992
01:21:16,706 --> 01:21:18,640
state-of-the-art kitchen. And we've got

993
01:21:18,742 --> 01:21:22,109
two new mini-buses
to shuttle people up from the old 'hood.

994
01:21:23,046 --> 01:21:25,879
Gentlemen, we appreciate the effort
that you put into this,

995
01:21:25,982 --> 01:21:28,246
but our church
is the backbone of our community.

996
01:21:28,351 --> 01:21:30,945
Well, without landmark status
the building is,

997
01:21:31,054 --> 01:21:33,716
it's really just become
too expensive to maintain, I mean,

998
01:21:33,823 --> 01:21:36,189
to restore it would cost
twice the price tag of all this.

999
01:21:36,293 --> 01:21:38,818
I'm sorry for all the work
you've put into this,

1000
01:21:38,928 --> 01:21:41,658
but I'm afraid we're going
to have to vote no.

1001
01:21:41,765 --> 01:21:45,098
Jake, the board's already made its decision.

1002
01:21:47,137 --> 01:21:50,368
Parker, what are you putting here?
Hotel, parking lot?

1003
01:21:51,308 --> 01:21:53,435
I see the Mayor's baseball stadium.

1004
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:57,978
This is a necessary step in rebuilding
our city's urban core.

1005
01:21:58,081 --> 01:22:00,106
- I'm not going to apologize...
- It's an off-ramp.

1006
01:22:00,216 --> 01:22:03,674
They're tearing down our church
for a bigger off-ramp. Unbelievable.

1007
01:22:03,787 --> 01:22:06,449
That baseball stadium
is going to provide economic stimulus...

1008
01:22:06,556 --> 01:22:07,580
For my people!

1009
01:22:07,691 --> 01:22:09,921
My people are lining up to sell hotdogs!

1010
01:22:10,026 --> 01:22:11,721
Pastor, you started Second Chance.

1011
01:22:11,895 --> 01:22:13,419
It's the right time, Amanda.

1012
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:16,158
God's gonna use
ministries like these everywhere

1013
01:22:16,266 --> 01:22:17,665
to help more needy people.

1014
01:22:17,767 --> 01:22:19,735
Is that how you justify selling us out?

1015
01:22:19,836 --> 01:22:21,861
For what it's worth,
he was outvoted on this by the board.

1016
01:22:21,971 --> 01:22:25,600
For what it's worth, we didn't even
have a say when he ran off to the suburbs.

1017
01:22:25,709 --> 01:22:29,543
I plant churches, Jake. I planted yours.

1018
01:22:29,646 --> 01:22:34,345
And all that good that you see
going on there, I see it at The Rock.

1019
01:22:34,484 --> 01:22:36,884
And I want to see more of it
all over the world.

1020
01:22:36,986 --> 01:22:40,353
It's a global vision, Jake.
We're just trying to be good stewards.

1021
01:22:40,457 --> 01:22:42,618
This isn't about stewardship.

1022
01:22:43,393 --> 01:22:45,327
It's about money and power.

1023
01:22:45,995 --> 01:22:48,259
And I don't believe
Jesus spoke highly of either.

1024
01:22:48,365 --> 01:22:50,128
Well, what about arrogance?

1025
01:22:54,437 --> 01:22:57,531
I guess these things happen
when we keep our damn money.

1026
01:22:59,175 --> 01:23:01,769
You know what makes me crazy
about the Bible?

1027
01:23:09,886 --> 01:23:11,581
It says I gotta love you.

1028
01:23:22,966 --> 01:23:24,194
And right now,

1029
01:23:26,636 --> 01:23:29,230
all I want to do is beat the hell out of you.

1030
01:23:41,384 --> 01:23:43,318
You don't want to lose that, Pastor.

1031
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:37,023
When I was a young boy of 13...

1032
01:25:50,346 --> 01:25:54,612
When I was a young boy,
I took my pocketknife

1033
01:25:56,219 --> 01:25:58,619
and carved into my bunk bed

1034
01:25:59,289 --> 01:26:01,382
the words of Malcolm X.

1035
01:26:03,026 --> 01:26:05,187
"We didn't land on Plymouth Rock.

1036
01:26:06,796 --> 01:26:10,357
"Plymouth Rock landed on us."

1037
01:26:14,904 --> 01:26:19,603
Those words are still ringing
in my ears today,

1038
01:26:21,544 --> 01:26:25,105
because soon this sanctuary

1039
01:26:26,049 --> 01:26:28,711
will become smashed-up rubble.

1040
01:26:30,954 --> 01:26:34,321
Once again the crushing rock of injustice

1041
01:26:35,291 --> 01:26:39,853
leaves us with a dry, gritty taste
in our mouths.

1042
01:26:58,581 --> 01:27:00,139
Brothers and sisters,

1043
01:27:03,620 --> 01:27:05,315
I'm here to tell you

1044
01:27:08,591 --> 01:27:11,321
that I've traded in Plymouth Rock.

1045
01:27:14,831 --> 01:27:16,458
I've traded it in

1046
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:20,692
for a Rock that builds me up.

1047
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:27,205
I've traded it in for a Rock
that gives me dignity,

1048
01:27:28,945 --> 01:27:31,778
courage, and compassion.

1049
01:27:38,321 --> 01:27:42,485
I traded in Plymouth Rock
for the Rock of Ages.

1050
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:53,930
And when we stand on the Rock of Ages,

1051
01:27:55,872 --> 01:27:59,865
we are required to stand tall
in the face of adversity.

1052
01:28:06,983 --> 01:28:08,541
When we stand

1053
01:28:10,286 --> 01:28:11,753
on the Rock of Ages,

1054
01:28:15,525 --> 01:28:16,787
we are asked...

1055
01:28:20,496 --> 01:28:21,463
We are...

1056
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,862
We're commanded

1057
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:31,566
- to love our enemies.
- Amen.

1058
01:29:20,323 --> 01:29:24,054
There's a song I learned in this place,
when I was a boy.

1059
01:29:27,964 --> 01:29:29,898
<i>On Christ the solid</i>

1060
01:29:31,434 --> 01:29:32,924
<i>Rock I stand</i>

1061
01:29:34,771 --> 01:29:36,671
<i>All other ground is</i>

1062
01:29:38,241 --> 01:29:39,538
<i>Sinking sand</i>

1063
01:29:41,878 --> 01:29:45,245
<i>All other ground is sinking sand</i>

1064
01:29:52,054 --> 01:29:53,544
Most of you all know

1065
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:57,184
that I didn't come to Second Chance
by choice.

1066
01:30:00,563 --> 01:30:03,031
I'd spent a lot of years in sinking sand,

1067
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:06,361
then God called me home.

1068
01:30:08,437 --> 01:30:10,132
And I wanted to serve Him

1069
01:30:11,374 --> 01:30:13,535
as long as I could stay comfortable,

1070
01:30:13,643 --> 01:30:15,372
stay where it's safe.

1071
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:20,314
Brothers and sisters, I want to thank you

1072
01:30:21,684 --> 01:30:22,946
for teaching me

1073
01:30:25,454 --> 01:30:27,319
that comfort is sinking sand.

1074
01:30:29,225 --> 01:30:32,752
Safety is sinking sand.

1075
01:30:35,231 --> 01:30:37,290
And even this beautiful sanctuary

1076
01:30:38,768 --> 01:30:40,326
wasn't built to last.

1077
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:46,170
The building isn't the church, is it?

1078
01:30:48,778 --> 01:30:51,042
Jonesy, you're the church.

1079
01:30:52,548 --> 01:30:55,881
Charday, you're the church.

1080
01:30:59,088 --> 01:31:01,181
Sonny, Amanda,

1081
01:31:03,159 --> 01:31:04,126
Tony,

1082
01:31:06,996 --> 01:31:09,328
you all have shown me the love of Jesus

1083
01:31:10,833 --> 01:31:12,300
by being His church.

1084
01:31:17,139 --> 01:31:18,106
And Jake,

1085
01:31:22,778 --> 01:31:24,439
if you'll allow us,

1086
01:31:25,314 --> 01:31:28,442
my future wife Val and I
would love to move into this community

1087
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:30,246
and be a part of your team

1088
01:31:31,487 --> 01:31:34,149
in whatever way you and the Lord see fit.

1089
01:31:49,839 --> 01:31:52,569
<i>My hope is built</i>

1090
01:31:52,675 --> 01:31:55,701
<i>On nothing less</i>

1091
01:31:55,811 --> 01:31:59,144
<i>Than Jesus' blood</i>

1092
01:31:59,248 --> 01:32:02,513
<i>And righteousness</i>

1093
01:32:02,618 --> 01:32:05,951
<i>I dare not trust</i>

1094
01:32:06,055 --> 01:32:09,183
<i>The sweetest frame</i>

1095
01:32:09,292 --> 01:32:12,523
<i>But wholly lean</i>

1096
01:32:12,628 --> 01:32:15,859
<i>On Jesus' name</i>

1097
01:32:15,965 --> 01:32:20,834
<i>On Christ the solid Rock</i>

1098
01:32:20,970 --> 01:32:22,437
<i>I stand</i>

1099
01:32:22,538 --> 01:32:25,803
<i>All other ground</i>

1100
01:32:25,908 --> 01:32:29,241
<i>Is sinking sand</i>

1101
01:32:29,345 --> 01:32:32,405
<i>All other ground</i>

1102
01:32:32,515 --> 01:32:36,542
<i>Is sinking sand</i>

1103
01:33:51,861 --> 01:33:54,659
- Beautiful old church.
- Yes, it is.

1104
01:33:55,498 --> 01:33:58,058
I wish we could've at least saved
the windows.

1105
01:33:58,934 --> 01:34:00,128
It's a shame.

1106
01:34:25,661 --> 01:34:26,958
Hey, Tony!

1107
01:34:28,464 --> 01:34:30,022
Some dude on the roof.

1108
01:34:31,267 --> 01:34:32,325
Up there.

1109
01:34:38,541 --> 01:34:40,634
What the hell's he doing up there?

1110
01:34:45,915 --> 01:34:47,678
Hey! Hey!

1111
01:34:48,818 --> 01:34:50,911
- Somebody's up there.
- Off the fence, boy.

1112
01:34:51,020 --> 01:34:53,784
- Somebody's up there.
- Get down off of this fence right now!

1113
01:34:53,889 --> 01:34:57,017
- Get down off the fence.
- There's somebody up there.

1114
01:34:57,126 --> 01:35:00,289
- Dad?
- There's somebody up there.

1115
01:35:03,065 --> 01:35:05,260
- You need to calm down.
- I didn't see you.

1116
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:07,597
You need to calm down
before I have you restrained.

1117
01:35:07,703 --> 01:35:08,692
No. No.

1118
01:35:13,375 --> 01:35:14,637
Are you coming?

1119
01:35:27,423 --> 01:35:30,153
Hold up, now. You better stay down here.

1120
01:35:33,963 --> 01:35:36,659
You know your momma's gonna
kill us both, right?

1121
01:35:44,740 --> 01:35:46,503
You need to get here. Okay.

1122
01:35:47,109 --> 01:35:48,371
Can you open up?

1123
01:35:48,477 --> 01:35:49,876
- Mr. Mayor...
- Yes.

1124
01:35:49,979 --> 01:35:52,675
- Who's in charge here?
- I think he is.

1125
01:35:58,220 --> 01:35:59,312
Whoa!

1126
01:36:00,222 --> 01:36:02,383
Time to get some shoes
with better traction, Gucci.

1127
01:36:02,491 --> 01:36:03,788
- Yeah.
- Got it?

1128
01:36:03,893 --> 01:36:04,860
Got it.

1129
01:36:09,832 --> 01:36:11,060
Yeah, he's a good man.

1130
01:36:13,369 --> 01:36:15,701
I guess something just happened to him.

1131
01:36:17,239 --> 01:36:20,436
Hey, Chief. We got a situation.

1132
01:36:28,751 --> 01:36:29,718
Pastor!

1133
01:36:30,653 --> 01:36:32,621
Don't get up. Don't get up.

1134
01:36:34,657 --> 01:36:37,592
Dad, what are you doing?

1135
01:36:39,061 --> 01:36:41,325
Studying for next Sunday's sermon.

1136
01:36:43,933 --> 01:36:45,560
So why are you studying up here?

1137
01:36:45,668 --> 01:36:50,037
If I'm not studying here,
this church is coming down.

1138
01:36:51,607 --> 01:36:53,268
I remember you.

1139
01:36:54,443 --> 01:36:57,037
<i>This is city property.</i>

1140
01:36:57,146 --> 01:37:00,673
<i>You are required
to vacate the rooftop, immediately.</i>

1141
01:37:07,122 --> 01:37:08,316
Okay.

1142
01:37:09,592 --> 01:37:12,356
Do something.
Just get these people out of here right now.

1143
01:37:12,828 --> 01:37:14,352
This is turning into a sideshow.

1144
01:37:14,463 --> 01:37:16,624
<i>I need all of you to leave the area.</i>

1145
01:37:19,668 --> 01:37:24,332
<i>I repeat, you are required
to leave the area at once.</i>

1146
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,713
What is she doing?

1147
01:37:33,549 --> 01:37:35,016
They sitting down?

1148
01:37:35,517 --> 01:37:38,486
No, no, no, no.

1149
01:37:41,257 --> 01:37:44,021
Jake, you remember the last time
we were up here?

1150
01:37:47,429 --> 01:37:49,329
We needed a new lightning rod.

1151
01:37:49,665 --> 01:37:51,530
But we didn't have any money,

1152
01:37:52,668 --> 01:37:54,397
so we wired up that cross.

1153
01:37:55,571 --> 01:37:58,904
I want to remember what it's like
to be that lightning rod.

1154
01:37:59,775 --> 01:38:04,075
To fear absolutely nothing
but God Almighty.
