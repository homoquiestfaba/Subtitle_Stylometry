1
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:56,541
I just loved breastfeeding.
And you know what's great?

2
00:02:56,578 --> 00:02:59,376
You can eat whatever you want
and not gain weight.

3
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:01,905
And it's good for the baby.

4
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,909
Did you know you can
nurse past menopause?

5
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:08,081
As long at the nipples
get enough attention,

6
00:03:08,123 --> 00:03:10,182
it reactivates the hormones.

7
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:12,489
Neuroendocrine reflex.

8
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:15,019
Oh no, that's something else.

9
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:20,835
Honey, do you have
my sweetener?

10
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:22,530
Sure, Mom.

11
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:34,111
Is there very much
protein in tofu?

12
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:36,481
It's tempeh.
It's full of it.

13
00:03:37,553 --> 00:03:40,681
Vivian's been thinking
of trying Atkins.

14
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:46,086
Don't eat that.

15
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:51,864
You'll get gas for days.

16
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,368
So you weren't crazy about
this last doctor either.

17
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:56,428
Ma.

18
00:03:58,106 --> 00:04:01,371
He had us wait two hours.
He only gave us five minutes.

19
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,435
He didn't even look me in the eye.

20
00:04:03,478 --> 00:04:07,107
It's too bad you didn't
like Richard Sohn.

21
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:09,549
He's been treating me for years.

22
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:14,113
His niece tried a manslaughter case
in my court last week.

23
00:04:14,156 --> 00:04:16,181
She looks wonderful.

24
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:18,055
You remember her.

25
00:04:18,093 --> 00:04:21,392
It was a terrible case.
This woman

26
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:25,730
starved her baby to death
feeding it wheatgrass

27
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:30,635
It's lucky she had a jury trial.

28
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:34,972
I'd have locked her up.

29
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,583
I'm going to see a midwife.

30
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,315
At which hospital?

31
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:48,323
It's an independent clinic.
It's self-contained.

32
00:04:48,357 --> 00:04:50,348
There's a reason people
have babies in hospitals.

33
00:04:50,392 --> 00:04:54,055
- Son: We're just checking it out.
- She's the best midwife working.

34
00:04:54,096 --> 00:04:56,758
Madeline was her
assistant professor at Amesley.

35
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:59,323
The best is in a hospital.

36
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:02,132
I do know a little bit
about this, you know.

37
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:06,599
So do I.

38
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:46,079
I'm trying to keep
an open mind about this.

39
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:48,241
I know.

40
00:05:48,283 --> 00:05:51,582
Anybody breaks out a power crystal,
we're leaving.

41
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,918
Deal.

42
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,028
Hello?

43
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:06,398
I think we're in the wrong place.

44
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:08,335
Could be.

45
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,271
I'm Shelly, the labor doula
and chief assistant midwife.

46
00:06:11,306 --> 00:06:13,797
I assist Patty with all the births.

47
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:16,811
Sit down. Let me grab her.
Have a cookie.

48
00:06:16,845 --> 00:06:18,836
They're vegan.

49
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,507
Great.

50
00:06:25,754 --> 00:06:27,483
Herbal.

51
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,790
Hi, Maddy.

52
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:39,731
You look great.

53
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:42,760
Um, this is my husband Michael.

54
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:44,738
- Hi.
- Hi.

55
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:47,435
- Did you get a cookie?
- No, not yet.

56
00:06:47,476 --> 00:06:49,876
She told you
they were vegan, didn't she?

57
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,845
I swear they are fantastic.

58
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,915
We keep the focus
on you and your baby.

59
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:01,980
Not just the birth, but those
crucial first moments too.

60
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:06,654
It's beautiful.

61
00:07:06,695 --> 00:07:10,563
Those first interactions between you
and your baby are so powerful.

62
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,160
They create biochemical responses
that we don't even understand.

63
00:07:14,202 --> 00:07:17,865
The sensitive period-
it's birth psychology.

64
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:20,865
Mm-hmm.

65
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:24,803
Patty:
I'm sure you have some questions.

66
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:27,906
- Michael: Are you a licensed doctor?
- I have a PhD in holistic obstetrics.

67
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:30,213
I also spent five years
training in a dozen

68
00:07:30,252 --> 00:07:32,379
different Eastern
healing modalities,

69
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,514
- in Nepal, Thailand-
- Medical doctor, I meant.

70
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:39,358
- I have an MD from Columbia.
- I didn't see any degrees.

71
00:07:39,394 --> 00:07:41,988
The less this place looks
like a hospital, the better.

72
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:45,261
Just no reason to medicalize
a perfect process.

73
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,861
See, if I break my leg, I'm not going
to get a chiropractor to set it.

74
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:52,203
But with pregnancy,
there's nothing broken.

75
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,265
But things do get broken
in the process.

76
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:56,607
Mostly at hospitals.

77
00:07:56,645 --> 00:08:00,911
Here. All the stats are all in there.
The studies are all state-funded.

78
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:03,110
Nothing is private.
Medical interventions

79
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:05,779
can be miraculous,
but not everybody needs a miracle.

80
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:08,085
Most of the time
they just create complications

81
00:08:08,123 --> 00:08:10,057
and we end up treating
the treatment.

82
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:12,491
Madeline: "Mothers are
three to six times more likely

83
00:08:12,527 --> 00:08:15,724
to die delivering in a hospital
than a midwife-supervised clinic

84
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:18,494
or home birth. "
It's on page 14.

85
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:25,265
Madeline, you said you had
taken fertility drugs.

86
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:27,673
Yeah, for three years.

87
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:31,304
But I'd been off them for 11 months
before she came.

88
00:08:32,347 --> 00:08:35,339
We got pregnant twice, but-

89
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:40,746
Hey.

90
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:43,916
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,118
Here.

92
00:08:53,535 --> 00:08:55,833
You have nothing
to be sorry about.

93
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:18,081
With proper care, these cows
could supply Grade A milk...

94
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:55,455
Oh, Jonesy.

95
00:09:55,497 --> 00:09:58,796
I have nice food for you right here.

96
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:33,098
Mm-mm.

97
00:10:44,546 --> 00:10:46,707
Thanks for doing this.

98
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:57,250
Ahh.

99
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:07,895
- No.
- No?

100
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:15,270
Jonesy killed another rat today.

101
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:20,079
Can't feed him soy milk.
You're driving him to murder.

102
00:11:20,115 --> 00:11:22,481
Did you take the car in?

103
00:11:22,517 --> 00:11:25,042
$2,000 later it's still
making the same noise.

104
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:28,078
Should have never
bought an SUV.

105
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:30,182
It's a hybrid.

106
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:35,221
- Ooh.
- Are you okay?

107
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:40,526
It's just gas or something.

108
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:45,231
I bought Patricia Lang's book.

109
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,310
She thanked you in the forward
and you two were really close.

110
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:52,438
Yeah, I learned a lot from her.

111
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,573
She was a really amazing teacher.

112
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:57,744
Some of her stuff
is pretty far out.

113
00:11:57,786 --> 00:12:00,050
She revolutionized
Women's Studies.

114
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:02,579
We had a two-year wait list
for her class at Amesley.

115
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:05,184
Hmm.

116
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:08,660
Michael, we have
an answering machine.

117
00:12:08,696 --> 00:12:11,756
It's Ma. I'll grab it in the kitchen.

118
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:18,765
Oooh.

119
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:21,469
Ahhh.

120
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,443
Ah.

121
00:12:23,478 --> 00:12:25,946
- Michael?
- Vivian: Michael?

122
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,005
- Ow, my chest.
- Vivian: What's happening?

123
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:30,313
- Can you move?
- Call Patricia.

124
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:32,649
- Is something wrong with Madeline?
- Ma, I have to go.

125
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:34,678
Don't call Dr. Sohn.
We're going to the ER.

126
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:37,020
Doctor: Is this the first time
she's had chest pains, sir?

127
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:40,619
- Michael: Yeah, as far as I know.
- Okay, let's get some levels on her.

128
00:12:40,662 --> 00:12:43,859
Man: It's all right, Michael.
It's all right.

129
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:45,889
Richard Sohn, what,
are you slumming?

130
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:48,801
The mother-in-law called me.
She's a friend of the family.

131
00:12:48,837 --> 00:12:50,896
Your mother's on her way back
from Hillbrook.

132
00:12:50,939 --> 00:12:54,534
- She'll be here in a hour.
- We giving you some trouble, Dick?

133
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:57,306
Yes, well, par for the course
in my line.

134
00:12:57,345 --> 00:13:01,008
So what do we have? Upper-right
quadrant pain, elevated blood-

135
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,074
this is pre-eclampsia.

136
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:05,586
We're going to need to induce.
We need to induce right now.

137
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,145
- No, she's only 31 weeks.
- Let's get three 35mcg

138
00:13:08,189 --> 00:13:10,419
vaginal doses of cytotec.
We're inducing.

139
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,358
- No no. No!
- Michael: What's that?

140
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:14,987
- Mike, Mike, I'll take care of her.
- No.

141
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,156
Madeline:
Call Patricia. Michael, please!

142
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:19,996
- He's not her doctor, Ma.
- Michael, I am not discussing this.

143
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:23,231
Well, you shouldn't have
sent him in the first place.

144
00:13:23,271 --> 00:13:25,739
Hello? Ma!

145
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:27,502
- Shit.
- Is she okay?

146
00:13:27,542 --> 00:13:30,807
They said it was something-
pre- pre-eclampsia?

147
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:34,144
If it's pre-eclampsia the only thing
they can do is deliver. What happened?

148
00:13:34,182 --> 00:13:36,582
We were having dinner
and she just started complaining.

149
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:38,279
She called my name.
I was in the other room.

150
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:40,685
- Where is she?
- All the way down on the far left.

151
00:13:40,722 --> 00:13:42,587
Is there blood?

152
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:44,922
She just said it felt like gas,
like in her chest.

153
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,291
- Okay, what about her breathing?
- Pretty even.

154
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:50,161
It was higher because she was in pain,
but I don't think it was bad.

155
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:52,223
- Madeline: Get off me!
- Hold her down.

156
00:13:52,267 --> 00:13:54,792
- What the hell is going on?
- You can't be in here.

157
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:57,100
- You can't be in here, miss.
- I'm her midwife.

158
00:13:57,138 --> 00:13:59,698
- Madeline: It's too soon.
- Why isn't she sedated?

159
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:01,606
- Where's the pain?
- Upper-right quadrant.

160
00:14:01,643 --> 00:14:03,975
increased blood pressure,
probably HELLP syndrome.

161
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:06,446
- We're inducing now.
- Is it moving to the shoulder blade?

162
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:08,847
- You cannot be in here.
- What are her levels?

163
00:14:11,486 --> 00:14:13,954
Oh, tell me you checked her levels
before ordering an induction.

164
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:15,853
If this is hypertension,
that baby is in jeopardy.

165
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,755
- Not if it's a gallstone, it's not.
- I'm calling security.

166
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,987
I am her doctor and I'm not going
anywhere untiI I see numbers.

167
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:22,758
You throw me out of here and you murder
that baby because of your negligence

168
00:14:22,797 --> 00:14:24,924
and I swear to God, I will see
that you never work again.

169
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:27,457
- Get those numbers now.
- What is your name?

170
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:30,232
- I'm Dr. Richard Sohn.
- Where are your scrubs?

171
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:32,330
I'm a friend of the family.

172
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:34,637
- He's not my doctor.
- If you're wrong,

173
00:14:34,676 --> 00:14:37,201
- you're in serious trouble.
- Go fuck yourself.

174
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:42,445
Cancel the cytotec.

175
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:45,316
Schedule an ultrasound to confirm
the presence of a stone.

176
00:15:17,285 --> 00:15:20,049
- Maybe you should just pull over.
- Where?

177
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:37,861
Asshole.

178
00:15:37,905 --> 00:15:40,533
Are you okay?

179
00:15:40,575 --> 00:15:43,476
Do you hear that?

180
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:16,010
Madeline:
She isn't moving.

181
00:16:21,316 --> 00:16:23,876
Call Patricia.

182
00:16:54,816 --> 00:16:57,478
Shelly: The police are
coming with an ambulance.

183
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:00,009
She won't go.

184
00:17:00,054 --> 00:17:02,079
She needs to go
to a regular hospital.

185
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:04,557
They'll induce her.
She won't go.

186
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:08,721
The baby's dead, Patty.

187
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:12,365
Patty: She'll deliver
on her own in three weeks.

188
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,561
Shelly: She can't make
that decision right now.

189
00:17:14,602 --> 00:17:16,092
She doesn't know what she wants.

190
00:17:17,238 --> 00:17:19,866
She knows exactly what she wants.

191
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:25,478
Henry?

192
00:17:31,085 --> 00:17:33,212
What's the matter?

193
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,016
- What?
- This room is a pigsty.

194
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,588
- It looks okay to me.
- Pick up your room!

195
00:17:45,066 --> 00:17:46,624
Clean up!

196
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:54,265
Vivian, it's okay.

197
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:56,572
Don't.

198
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,208
Thank you.

199
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:12,988
Henry?

200
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:16,489
Henry?

201
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:20,757
Michael... Michael.

202
00:18:36,717 --> 00:18:39,845
Michael's voice on answering machine:
Hi, you've reached the Mathesons.

203
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:41,946
Before you know it, we're gonna
have a teenager on our hands,

204
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:43,889
so leave a message
while you can still get through.

205
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:47,088
Madeline, it's Patty.

206
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:50,188
We should talk soon
about the delivery.

207
00:18:51,766 --> 00:18:55,668
You should try to get out. It's not good
for you to be too stationary right now.

208
00:18:55,703 --> 00:18:58,695
Um, call me, okay?

209
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:48,086
Did you find
what you were looking for?

210
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:52,657
Miss?

211
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:11,271
All right, Mad, you're doing great.

212
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,172
See me, see me, see me.
Look look look.

213
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:18,515
Look here, right here.
Breathe breathe.

214
00:20:18,553 --> 00:20:22,250
It's okay now. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

215
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,521
Madeline, we're gonna
move you now.

216
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,927
- Up we go, smooth motion.
- Traveling traveling.

217
00:20:28,963 --> 00:20:30,828
And shifting.
Coming around.

218
00:20:30,865 --> 00:20:33,095
Get the arms around her.

219
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,962
The baby's descended.

220
00:20:38,005 --> 00:20:40,030
We've got to put her in the tub.
She's in too much pain.

221
00:20:40,074 --> 00:20:41,371
In the tub, in the tub.

222
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:44,310
Melissa, you need
to bring her back here.

223
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:46,813
- She's too tight.
- I've got her.

224
00:20:51,285 --> 00:20:53,913
- I've got left- up!
- Okay, come on, get her back in.

225
00:20:53,955 --> 00:20:56,822
Give me the left. We've got you,
we've got you, we've got you.

226
00:20:56,857 --> 00:20:59,018
Shifting!

227
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:01,824
You'll be okay, all right.

228
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:04,057
All right, all right.
Get her head.

229
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:05,929
- Ow, I'm tearing!
- No no no.

230
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:07,298
You're not tearing, baby.

231
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:20,873
Push push push.

232
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:52,778
Can I hold her?

233
00:21:58,653 --> 00:22:00,416
Please?

234
00:22:17,605 --> 00:22:19,698
Suction.

235
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:22,866
Suction.
Do it now.

236
00:22:57,278 --> 00:22:59,212
You're so little.

237
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,830
Do you know how much
I want you to stay?

238
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,102
Please stay.

239
00:24:04,745 --> 00:24:07,236
Madeline, you can't
will a baby back to I-

240
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:13,982
life.

241
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:18,481
It's Grace.

242
00:24:20,528 --> 00:24:22,723
Her name is Grace.

243
00:24:22,797 --> 00:24:25,322
Vivian on phone:
Did you put those photos aside?

244
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:28,926
Madeline: It's been hard packing
his things, Vivian. I'm sorry.

245
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:32,336
Vivian: I can stop by today
if you'd just put them in a box for me.

246
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:35,240
I'll spend some time with the baby.
I'm sure you could use the help.

247
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:37,005
- Ow.
- Was that the baby?

248
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:40,377
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. She's fine.

249
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:42,814
Let's make an appointment
for you to see a doctor.

250
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:46,676
Vivian, I have to go.

251
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,881
Why not just go in
and see Dr. Sohn?

252
00:24:48,923 --> 00:24:51,084
Because Dr. Sohn isn't my doctor.

253
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:54,993
I know you've been seeing your friend,
but a midwife isn't a doctor.

254
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:58,590
- She is a doctor.
- If you can't get out to his office

255
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:01,294
I can ask him to stop by for a visit.

256
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:03,428
Vivian, this is a bad time.
I have to go.

257
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,633
- I will be leaving work a little early.
- My mother-in-law.

258
00:25:06,674 --> 00:25:09,006
Vivian: It would be great
to have a little time with her.

259
00:25:09,043 --> 00:25:10,977
I'm sure she'd love to see her
grandmother

260
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:13,241
and I know Henry is just
dying to see her.

261
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,738
And I'm sure you'd love
an opportunity to retrench.

262
00:25:16,784 --> 00:25:19,150
- Patty: Hey, there.
- No, I can take care of her.

263
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:21,017
- Bye, Vivian.
- Don't forget the photos.

264
00:25:22,423 --> 00:25:25,221
She breast-fed Michael
till he was three years old.

265
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:29,127
She misses him.

266
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:31,927
Um, I'm sorry.
Can I use your bathroom?

267
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:37,862
Oh, I got these.

268
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:41,397
I realized that I never gave you
a congratulations gift.

269
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:46,802
It's like a women's version
of a cigar, I guess. Heh.

270
00:26:02,663 --> 00:26:04,221
Idiot.

271
00:26:11,171 --> 00:26:13,503
The pressure is applied
intermittently between bleedings

272
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,269
to preserve the animal's blood

273
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:17,937
in its own body and ensure
the freshness of samples.

274
00:26:17,978 --> 00:26:21,209
The blood must be centrifuged
before clotting begins...

275
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:22,909
Pleasant.

276
00:26:24,485 --> 00:26:27,886
Animal Channel- I'm hooked.

277
00:26:27,922 --> 00:26:30,686
It's like a vegan horror movie.

278
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:34,159
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, of course.

279
00:26:34,194 --> 00:26:38,062
Oh, hey! You know what?
I got her something.

280
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:41,295
Um, here.
PachelBaby's my favorite.

281
00:26:41,335 --> 00:26:43,166
Oh, and...

282
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,373
- You didn't have to do all this.
- Sure, I did.

283
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,901
Toy:
I love to hug my kitty.

284
00:26:52,947 --> 00:26:56,314
- Patty: God, she's beautiful.
- She hardly ever cries.

285
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:00,680
- How are you doing?
- No complaints.

286
00:27:00,721 --> 00:27:02,518
Nipples hurt a little bit.

287
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:05,889
Keep those things stimulated,
you'll be able to nurse till you're 60.

288
00:27:05,926 --> 00:27:08,724
- Neuroendocrine reflex.
- You got it.

289
00:27:13,233 --> 00:27:16,396
- How was the blood work?
- It was all normal.

290
00:27:16,437 --> 00:27:18,371
Of course it was.

291
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:21,340
Madeline, I know that you do not
want to take her to the hospital,

292
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,900
but there are some tests
that can help us understand-

293
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:25,912
We're not a case study.

294
00:27:25,946 --> 00:27:29,279
- I don't need to understand a miracle.
- Madeline-

295
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:31,307
If it were up to them
she would be dead.

296
00:27:31,352 --> 00:27:34,617
You said you could take care of anything
she needs. If you don't want to help...

297
00:27:34,655 --> 00:27:36,850
- No, all right, I get it.
- ... I'll find somebody else.

298
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,983
Oh, Dr. Jones!

299
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:42,052
The prominent
North American rat surgeon lives.

300
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:44,223
Oh, he's huge.

301
00:27:45,265 --> 00:27:48,632
Do you remember what Tracey Sullivan
used to call the three of us?

302
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,297
Ma and Pa and Baby J.

303
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:56,605
Don't.

304
00:27:57,644 --> 00:27:59,544
I'm sorry.

305
00:28:31,078 --> 00:28:33,444
How about this?

306
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:19,191
Grace, okay okay.

307
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:52,852
All right, out you go.

308
00:30:28,462 --> 00:30:30,191
Oh my God!

309
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:40,761
Oh, Jonesy.

310
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:07,555
All clean!

311
00:32:09,896 --> 00:32:12,626
No more bugs, no more stinky.

312
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:17,695
Hi, my girl.

313
00:32:17,738 --> 00:32:21,174
Come on.

314
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:35,614
The stars in heaven

315
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:38,523
Tucked in the sun

316
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:45,923
And each little flower
knows this day is done

317
00:32:45,966 --> 00:32:49,561
And one lonesome bird sings

318
00:32:49,603 --> 00:32:52,003
A quiet good night

319
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:56,032
My sweet little angel

320
00:32:56,076 --> 00:32:59,705
It's time for good night

321
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:03,443
So sleep and dream

322
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:06,919
Just close your eyes

323
00:33:06,953 --> 00:33:10,445
And I'll be here waiting

324
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,119
The moment you rise

325
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:18,222
So sleep little angel

326
00:33:18,265 --> 00:33:22,224
It's time for good night.

327
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,406
Baby, bath time's over.

328
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:30,239
Don't cry. I'm sorry.

329
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:35,412
Machine:
You've reached Nature Birth.

330
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:38,976
Leave a message and we'll
get back to you after the miracle.

331
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:42,511
Grace has a really bad rash...
she smells funny.

332
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:44,490
I don't know.
I put her in the tub-

333
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:48,517
I really don't know what happened.
The temperature was fine.

334
00:33:48,562 --> 00:33:51,190
Maybe it was the soap.

335
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:53,392
I don't know, can you call me back?

336
00:33:57,804 --> 00:33:59,237
Oh, piece of crap.

337
00:33:59,272 --> 00:34:02,503
I know, okay okay okay.
I know, sweetie.

338
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:04,203
I know, I know.

339
00:34:04,244 --> 00:34:08,044
Let's have a nice snack.
Shh-hhh.

340
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:12,450
Shhh. Here we go.
Here we go.

341
00:34:12,486 --> 00:34:15,148
All right, all right.

342
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:17,122
Come on, Gracie.

343
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,428
Okay, let's lay down.

344
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:10,906
Shelly: Are you okay?

345
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:13,845
Yeah.

346
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:19,013
- Are you going somewhere?
- No.

347
00:35:19,052 --> 00:35:20,679
Uh, well, I don't know.

348
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,484
I thought it might be fun to go
for a road trip or something.

349
00:35:23,523 --> 00:35:24,888
You know, get away?

350
00:35:24,925 --> 00:35:27,951
- From me?
- No, of course not.

351
00:35:31,531 --> 00:35:33,055
She's sick.

352
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,271
Whatever you had with her
is over.

353
00:36:28,121 --> 00:36:31,386
Are you ready for a snack?

354
00:36:35,595 --> 00:36:38,223
Oh, honey.

355
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:46,037
Okay.

356
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:56,449
Gentle, honey.

357
00:36:56,483 --> 00:36:58,644
Ahh!

358
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:37,370
Ow!

359
00:39:59,299 --> 00:40:01,267
Ow.

360
00:40:32,065 --> 00:40:35,398
Sweetheart.

361
00:40:38,271 --> 00:40:40,535
You have to eat something.

362
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:43,371
Oh...

363
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:01,358
Please, honey.

364
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:09,124
You need to eat something.

365
00:41:11,337 --> 00:41:14,363
Baby, please.

366
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:32,080
Okay, Mommy needs a break.

367
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:50,065
The stars in heaven

368
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:54,239
Tucked in the sun

369
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:02,153
And each little flower
knows this day is done

370
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:08,718
And one lonesome bird sings

371
00:42:08,761 --> 00:42:13,357
A quiet good night

372
00:42:15,835 --> 00:42:19,965
My sweet little angel

373
00:42:20,006 --> 00:42:23,601
It's time to sleep tight

374
00:42:25,812 --> 00:42:30,112
So sleep and dream

375
00:42:31,517 --> 00:42:35,146
Just close your eyes

376
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:43,086
I'll be here waiting

377
00:42:43,129 --> 00:42:48,294
The moment you rise...

378
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:34,042
Man:
Kinder kills, cleaner cuts.

379
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,847
Carl's Cows have no antibiotics
and no synthetic growth hormones.

380
00:43:39,852 --> 00:43:42,616
Kinder kills, cleaner cuts.

381
00:43:42,655 --> 00:43:47,251
Carl's Cows have no antibiotics
and no synthetic growth hormones.

382
00:43:47,293 --> 00:43:50,785
Kinder kills, cleaner cuts.

383
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:55,563
Carl's Cows have no antibiotics
and no synthetic growth hormones.

384
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:58,365
Kinder kills, cleaner cut-

385
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,401
I know, honey, just a sec.

386
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:48,210
Come on.

387
00:44:58,131 --> 00:44:59,928
Please.

388
00:46:12,205 --> 00:46:14,605
Grace!

389
00:46:18,845 --> 00:46:21,780
- Shelly, it's Madeline.
- She's not in, Madeline.

390
00:46:21,814 --> 00:46:24,476
- When will she be back?
- I don't know, I'm sorry.

391
00:46:24,517 --> 00:46:27,509
Please have her call me when she
gets back. It's an emergency.

392
00:46:27,553 --> 00:46:30,044
Okay.

393
00:46:47,473 --> 00:46:49,498
Yes, sir.

394
00:46:49,542 --> 00:46:51,737
Thank you.

395
00:46:51,777 --> 00:46:53,711
Excuse me.

396
00:46:53,746 --> 00:46:56,214
I'd like to see Dr. Sohn.

397
00:46:56,249 --> 00:46:59,412
- Yes?
- Mrs. Matheson is insisting

398
00:46:59,452 --> 00:47:02,580
on seeing you-
Judge Matheson.

399
00:47:02,622 --> 00:47:05,284
Send her in.

400
00:47:15,067 --> 00:47:17,160
- Your Honor.
- Hi, Richard.

401
00:47:19,272 --> 00:47:21,604
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

402
00:47:21,641 --> 00:47:24,235
I'm so sorry about Mike.

403
00:47:25,912 --> 00:47:28,312
The woman he married-

404
00:47:28,347 --> 00:47:30,178
she's sick.

405
00:47:30,216 --> 00:47:32,980
Does she need a referral?
I could...

406
00:47:33,019 --> 00:47:36,250
After the accident,
she told us the baby was dead,

407
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:39,258
but that she was going
to carry it to term anyway.

408
00:47:40,826 --> 00:47:43,886
We were going to pretend
it was a stillbirth.

409
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:47,661
But then when I didn't hear from her,
I phoned the birthing clinic...

410
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:52,330
about the funeral arrangements.
And the assistant told me

411
00:47:52,371 --> 00:47:56,034
that the baby had been born
and that it was fine.

412
00:47:57,276 --> 00:48:00,507
- Who's her OB?
- A midwife delivered.

413
00:48:00,546 --> 00:48:03,674
Madeline won't go to a hospital.
She won't see a real doctor.

414
00:48:03,716 --> 00:48:06,549
She doesn't even
pick up the phone.

415
00:48:06,586 --> 00:48:08,520
Well, have you
called the police?

416
00:48:08,554 --> 00:48:11,546
I've seen this 1,000 times.

417
00:48:11,591 --> 00:48:15,755
If I file with the police, that baby
will spend weeks in state care,

418
00:48:15,795 --> 00:48:18,355
while Youth Services
shuffles paperwork.

419
00:48:19,398 --> 00:48:22,333
I do not want this woman

420
00:48:22,368 --> 00:48:24,893
raising my granddaughter.

421
00:48:26,806 --> 00:48:29,468
If I...

422
00:48:29,508 --> 00:48:32,033
could get a medical report

423
00:48:32,078 --> 00:48:35,104
confirming that she's not fit...

424
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:39,850
And you'd take the baby?

425
00:48:42,521 --> 00:48:44,887
My son is gone.

426
00:48:52,265 --> 00:48:54,597
Well...

427
00:48:54,634 --> 00:48:57,330
maybe there's something

428
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:00,134
that you could do for me too.

429
00:49:07,213 --> 00:49:10,546
I... I got myself in a little trouble.

430
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:12,744
Shhh.

431
00:49:19,625 --> 00:49:23,152
Just help me and I'll help you.

432
00:49:35,841 --> 00:49:38,366
Shhh.

433
00:49:41,247 --> 00:49:43,738
Sohn: Mrs. Matheson?

434
00:49:58,097 --> 00:50:00,725
Vivian, it's Richard.

435
00:50:00,766 --> 00:50:04,099
I can't prove neglect
unless she opens up.

436
00:50:05,638 --> 00:50:07,697
I said I would help.

437
00:50:16,749 --> 00:50:18,683
Shhh.

438
00:50:19,919 --> 00:50:22,114
No one's gonna take you away.

439
00:50:22,154 --> 00:50:23,849
Shhh.

440
00:50:27,293 --> 00:50:29,454
Shhh.

441
00:50:39,672 --> 00:50:42,072
Michael's voice:
Hi, you've reached the Mathesons.

442
00:50:42,108 --> 00:50:44,736
Before you know it, we're going
to have a teenager on our hands,

443
00:50:44,777 --> 00:50:46,938
so leave a message
while you can still get through.

444
00:51:45,371 --> 00:51:47,862
Oh my God, what happened?

445
00:51:47,907 --> 00:51:51,206
Shhh.

446
00:51:51,243 --> 00:51:54,041
Okay, shhh.

447
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:56,912
Shhh. Okay.

448
00:51:58,918 --> 00:52:02,547
Shhh, okay, come here.

449
00:52:03,689 --> 00:52:06,681
Shhh.

450
00:52:14,066 --> 00:52:16,762
- Oh.
- Toy: I love to hug my kitty.

451
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:23,968
Jonesy?

452
00:52:52,972 --> 00:52:55,270
Shhh.

453
00:52:55,307 --> 00:52:57,537
Baby, you just ate.

454
00:52:57,576 --> 00:53:00,101
I know, honey.
Mommy's thirsty too.

455
00:53:17,997 --> 00:53:20,693
Man on TV: When Lucy came in,

456
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:24,134
she had so many fleas,
they were literally sucking her dry.

457
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:29,438
If she stayed out there, the chill
and fatigue would get worse

458
00:53:29,475 --> 00:53:33,104
and eventually the heart
just wouldn't be able to keep up.

459
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,242
For her to have a chance,
even without the fleas,

460
00:53:37,283 --> 00:53:39,945
we'd have to load her system
with the vitamins she lost.

461
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:44,346
The owner had no malicious intent-
if you can't take care of yourself

462
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:46,756
how do you take care of your animal?

463
00:54:00,839 --> 00:54:04,206
- Shelly, please!
- I can take another message.

464
00:54:04,243 --> 00:54:06,108
I've been trying for two days.

465
00:54:06,145 --> 00:54:09,171
I'm sure she got your voicemaiI.

466
00:54:09,214 --> 00:54:12,547
Have you thought more about
going to the hospital?

467
00:54:12,585 --> 00:54:15,179
- Just have her call me back.
- Okay.

468
00:54:20,526 --> 00:54:23,222
- Who was that?
- The trailer guy.

469
00:54:25,631 --> 00:54:28,293
It's a motor home.

470
00:54:42,314 --> 00:54:44,680
Richard, it's me.

471
00:54:44,717 --> 00:54:47,151
I need you to go back.

472
00:54:47,186 --> 00:54:48,847
Today.

473
00:54:48,887 --> 00:54:51,447
I need you to go back today.
I am not letting that baby

474
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:54,050
spend one more night
with that woman.

475
00:54:54,093 --> 00:54:56,994
Just give me till this evening.

476
00:54:58,197 --> 00:55:00,062
Good.

477
00:56:27,953 --> 00:56:30,581
Patricia?

478
00:56:33,225 --> 00:56:35,750
Mrs. Matheson?

479
00:56:35,794 --> 00:56:39,059
There there now. It's all right.

480
00:56:39,098 --> 00:56:41,532
It's all right.

481
00:56:41,567 --> 00:56:44,434
I'm sick.

482
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:46,734
I'm here to help.

483
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,999
Come and sit down.
Come and sit down.

484
00:56:53,212 --> 00:56:55,874
That's it.

485
00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:00,411
We're not going to the hospital.

486
00:57:00,452 --> 00:57:03,751
I can't help you unless
I know what's going on.

487
00:57:05,057 --> 00:57:07,321
I'm just so cold.

488
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:11,386
Could you open
your mouth for me, please?

489
00:57:24,143 --> 00:57:28,136
You're badly anemic.
I'm going to have to do a proper exam.

490
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:30,080
What kind of exam?

491
00:57:30,115 --> 00:57:34,051
Well, it is a serious condition,
but it can probably be treated

492
00:57:34,086 --> 00:57:36,486
with a little time
and proper nourishment.

493
00:57:36,522 --> 00:57:40,822
It may be a simple as feeding
the baby a little formula

494
00:57:40,859 --> 00:57:43,623
for a little bit to give
your body time to recoup.

495
00:57:43,662 --> 00:57:46,096
But I need to do a proper exam

496
00:57:46,131 --> 00:57:49,157
to confirm the extent of the condition.

497
00:57:52,704 --> 00:57:56,196
It, um, it can be slightly intrusive.

498
00:57:57,776 --> 00:58:00,939
Maybe- maybe you'd just better get
the child and we can go to the hospital.

499
00:58:00,979 --> 00:58:04,278
No! No, please.
I don't care if it's intrusive.

500
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,009
Hmm.

501
00:58:30,509 --> 00:58:33,444
- If you're too cold to disrobe, we-
- No!

502
00:58:36,148 --> 00:58:39,640
Turn around.
Unbutton your shirt.

503
00:58:48,594 --> 00:58:50,960
Nice and deep.

504
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,931
Again.

505
00:59:02,441 --> 00:59:05,069
I'm gonna need one of these.

506
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:16,248
Now I'm going to stick you.

507
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:18,881
Are you ready?

508
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:32,462
Is that it?

509
00:59:32,504 --> 00:59:34,665
Just one more.

510
00:59:34,706 --> 00:59:37,800
I'm sorry. I should have
explained it to you.

511
00:59:37,843 --> 00:59:40,835
I'm going to need a sample
of your breast milk-

512
00:59:40,879 --> 00:59:44,337
to make sure that the baby is
getting what she needs.

513
00:59:46,084 --> 00:59:48,780
The newer models are
much less cumbersome,

514
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:52,551
but these old brass units provide
a much more natural suction.

515
00:59:53,792 --> 00:59:57,193
- One of them is sore.
- All I need is one.

516
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:00,998
I know the pewter looks
a little archaic,

517
01:00:01,033 --> 01:00:05,697
but the leather seals are much more
gentle than the plastic flanges.

518
01:00:05,737 --> 01:00:08,968
And the jars were bigger because
with such a precision instrument,

519
01:00:09,007 --> 01:00:13,034
your supply would be triple.
This is the original blown-glass.

520
01:00:18,784 --> 01:00:22,311
Why don't you hold these?
I'm going to need both of my hands.

521
01:00:25,223 --> 01:00:27,953
It's quite all right to turn around.

522
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:33,555
Whenever you're ready.

523
01:00:33,598 --> 01:00:36,931
Just let me know
if the suction's too much.

524
01:01:05,464 --> 01:01:07,125
Is she sick?

525
01:01:07,165 --> 01:01:09,099
She's just cranky.

526
01:01:14,539 --> 01:01:16,564
That baby is sick.

527
01:01:16,608 --> 01:01:18,633
She's just got a little bit
of a cough.

528
01:01:18,677 --> 01:01:20,611
Where is she?
Where is she?

529
01:01:20,645 --> 01:01:23,443
Just let her rest.
She's fine. Please!

530
01:01:23,482 --> 01:01:27,851
Please, you don't understand.

531
01:01:27,886 --> 01:01:29,717
Vivian, it's Richie-

532
01:01:29,755 --> 01:01:32,315
Ahh!

533
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,468
Oh, come on, come on.

534
01:01:43,502 --> 01:01:46,096
Henry, I can't hear myself think!

535
01:01:50,876 --> 01:01:53,276
- Did you get Richard?
- Please-

536
01:01:53,311 --> 01:01:55,541
just-

537
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,775
finish the crib.

538
01:03:44,789 --> 01:03:48,054
Richard, pick up.
Call me back.

539
01:03:48,093 --> 01:03:50,721
I'm going over there.

540
01:05:26,524 --> 01:05:28,958
Shelly: I'm heading out.
Do you need anything?

541
01:05:28,994 --> 01:05:30,222
No, thanks.

542
01:05:43,875 --> 01:05:47,208
Is this Cory? Hi, it's Patricia Lang
calling about the motor home.

543
01:05:47,245 --> 01:05:49,475
I'm sorry it took me
so long to get back.

544
01:05:49,514 --> 01:05:51,778
I wanted to go ahead
and move forward.

545
01:05:51,816 --> 01:05:54,444
Cory: I was going to call you back,
but I lost your number.

546
01:05:54,486 --> 01:05:56,954
I thought you left
a message with Shelly.

547
01:05:56,988 --> 01:06:00,515
- Shelly?
- Shelly my assistant.

548
01:07:54,706 --> 01:07:57,004
Madeline?

549
01:07:57,041 --> 01:07:59,509
Are you home?

550
01:08:00,979 --> 01:08:03,641
The door was open.

551
01:08:03,681 --> 01:08:06,377
Um, I'm just feeding the baby.

552
01:08:11,623 --> 01:08:14,990
Why don't you make yourself some tea?
I'll be right down.

553
01:08:15,026 --> 01:08:17,551
Do you want anything?

554
01:08:17,595 --> 01:08:19,290
I'm fine.

555
01:08:20,832 --> 01:08:23,300
Okay.

556
01:08:36,147 --> 01:08:38,581
Come on, honey, please.

557
01:10:48,212 --> 01:10:51,272
Oh, I'm sorry.

558
01:10:51,316 --> 01:10:53,546
Shhh.

559
01:10:55,887 --> 01:10:58,481
Can I have a little peek?

560
01:11:03,728 --> 01:11:06,162
- What are you doing here?
- I was worried.

561
01:11:06,197 --> 01:11:08,791
Jesus, Madeline,
you look terrible.

562
01:11:08,833 --> 01:11:11,961
I haven't been getting
enough sleep.

563
01:11:14,739 --> 01:11:18,334
Can I have some tea?

564
01:11:18,376 --> 01:11:20,640
I ran out.

565
01:11:20,678 --> 01:11:23,875
When was the last time
you saw a doctor?

566
01:11:23,915 --> 01:11:26,679
Today. I'm fine, really.

567
01:11:26,718 --> 01:11:30,654
They did some blood tests and told me
to use formula for a few days.

568
01:11:31,823 --> 01:11:34,223
I'm just tired.

569
01:11:34,258 --> 01:11:36,192
Richard Sohn
didn't stop by, did he?

570
01:11:37,862 --> 01:11:41,354
No. You asked him
to check on me?

571
01:11:41,399 --> 01:11:43,560
I got worried.

572
01:11:43,601 --> 01:11:45,694
You haven't been
picking up the phone.

573
01:11:45,737 --> 01:11:48,729
I just wanted to see
if everything was all right.

574
01:11:48,773 --> 01:11:51,606
God, Madeline, you look terrible.

575
01:11:51,643 --> 01:11:53,508
Can we do this
another time, Vivian?

576
01:11:53,544 --> 01:11:56,035
Could I just have a quick look at her?

577
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,105
No.

578
01:11:59,384 --> 01:12:01,750
She's had a tough day
and I want her to sleep.

579
01:12:01,786 --> 01:12:03,515
Tomorrow, okay?

580
01:12:05,657 --> 01:12:07,352
Is she sick?

581
01:12:07,392 --> 01:12:10,691
Vivian, really, tomorrow.

582
01:12:16,234 --> 01:12:18,429
Okay.

583
01:12:28,413 --> 01:12:30,643
I, um...

584
01:12:30,682 --> 01:12:33,651
have to go to the loo
before I go home.

585
01:13:41,085 --> 01:13:43,883
Vivian!

586
01:13:52,497 --> 01:13:54,965
Grace?

587
01:14:28,566 --> 01:14:30,397
Vivian!

588
01:14:48,653 --> 01:14:50,848
Get away from us.

589
01:14:50,888 --> 01:14:53,857
Please, you don't understand.

590
01:14:53,891 --> 01:14:57,486
She's special.
She needs special food.

591
01:14:59,197 --> 01:15:01,791
You're sick. Get back!

592
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:07,704
Please, just let her go.

593
01:15:10,074 --> 01:15:11,871
Let her go.

594
01:15:14,579 --> 01:15:15,876
You'll kill her.

595
01:15:21,953 --> 01:15:23,580
Madeline?

596
01:15:30,995 --> 01:15:33,555
Oh God.

597
01:15:34,599 --> 01:15:39,232
Oh God.

598
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:41,966
Please.

599
01:15:42,006 --> 01:15:43,132
Wake up.

600
01:15:43,174 --> 01:15:45,233
Wake... oh, Jesus.

601
01:15:45,276 --> 01:15:47,972
Oh, please, I'm sorry.

602
01:16:19,176 --> 01:16:21,201
Madeline.

603
01:17:45,863 --> 01:17:47,888
Patty:
How you doing, fatso?

604
01:18:21,198 --> 01:18:23,564
Dinnertime, baby.

605
01:18:50,928 --> 01:18:52,919
Come here, Jonesy.

606
01:19:05,676 --> 01:19:08,440
It's so quiet back here.

607
01:19:09,814 --> 01:19:12,214
God, she looks fantastic.

608
01:19:12,249 --> 01:19:14,217
She finally had something to eat?

609
01:19:16,487 --> 01:19:18,955
I told you everything
tested healthy.

610
01:19:18,989 --> 01:19:21,389
It's all about
maintaining your diet.

611
01:19:21,425 --> 01:19:25,828
We keep your blood levels up,
we can do this.

612
01:19:31,202 --> 01:19:34,171
There's something else.

613
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,308
She needs more now.

614
01:19:43,347 --> 01:19:45,508
She's teething.

615
01:19:57,661 --> 01:20:01,062
The stars in heaven

616
01:20:01,098 --> 01:20:03,965
Tucked in the sun

617
01:20:04,001 --> 01:20:10,463
And each little flower
knows this day is done

618
01:20:10,508 --> 01:20:14,171
And one lonesome bird sings

619
01:20:14,211 --> 01:20:17,476
A quiet good night

620
01:20:17,515 --> 01:20:20,814
My sweet little angel

621
01:20:20,851 --> 01:20:24,218
It's time for good night

622
01:20:24,255 --> 01:20:27,918
So sleep and dream

623
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:31,792
Just close your eyes

624
01:20:31,829 --> 01:20:35,230
I'll be here waiting

625
01:20:35,266 --> 01:20:38,702
The moment you rise

626
01:20:38,736 --> 01:20:42,729
And one lonesome bird sings

627
01:20:42,773 --> 01:20:46,004
A quiet good night

628
01:20:46,043 --> 01:20:49,501
My sweet little angel

629
01:20:49,547 --> 01:20:52,812
It's time to sleep tight.
