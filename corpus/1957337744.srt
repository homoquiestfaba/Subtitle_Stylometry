189
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:01,354
[Giggles]

190
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:06,159
Don't worry, we've got
it all under control!

191
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:10,797
Maya! I was
cleaning here first!

192
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:13,632
Ha ha ha!

193
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:16,368
Ha ha ha!

194
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:20,173
I think this apartment
is just too small
for you two.

195
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:24,844
Huh! ¡Eso es!

196
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:28,247
No, Maya, we're not going to
do one of your crazy ideas.

197
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,615
But it's perfect!

198
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:31,951
We'll divide the
apartment in half!

199
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,353
¿Dividir el
apartmento por la mitad?

200
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:35,521
Down the middle.

201
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:38,224
Miguel stays out of my way;
I stay out of his.

202
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,726
We won't bump into each other,
and we won't ruin each other's

203
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,197
things, and the whole family
will be peaceful and happy!

204
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,732
Maya...

205
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:48,467
that's a great idea!

206
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,704
Half the apartment for you,
and half for me!

207
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,772
You two could
never do that.

208
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:56,609
You'd be in each
other's space
in five minutes.

209
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,077
Of course we can, mama!

210
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,347
¡Mitad para Maya
y mitad para mi!

211
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,216
When Miguel and I
set our minds to
something, mama,

212
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:05,718
nothing can stop us!

213
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,019
That's right!

214
00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:08,587
Yeah!

215
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,756
I guess if they
want to try it.

216
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:13,259
¡Gracias, papi!
I'll get the tape.

217
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,761
Oh, you won't regret this!

218
00:08:15,794 --> 00:08:18,664
I think
I already do.

219
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:20,800
Double trouble.

220
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:28,608
Let's use this tape to
divide the apartment in half.

221
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:39,685
[Humming]

222
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,991
Great job, Maya!

223
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:47,393
Gracias.

224
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:48,994
PACO: Ahem.

225
00:08:49,027 --> 00:08:51,030
Help, please?

226
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:58,470
Not so fast, Maya!

227
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,706
Tape!

228
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:01,974
Oh, come on, Paco!

229
00:09:02,007 --> 00:09:03,609
I need to take
a shower.

230
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:06,045
Morning, Maya!

231
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:07,379
Miguel, wait!

232
00:09:07,412 --> 00:09:09,348
Yeeeees?

233
00:09:09,381 --> 00:09:12,785
Well, um--you have to
let me use the bathroom!

234
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,086
Gosh, Maya.

235
00:09:14,119 --> 00:09:16,755
I thought we divided
the apartment in half.

236
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:19,892
I stay out of your half,
you stay out of mine.

237
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:23,128
But I have to get
ready for school!

238
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:25,464
Oh, all right.

239
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:27,399
You kids keeping
your bargain?

240
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:29,068
No one's crossing
the tape?

241
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:31,704
Um. Of course, mama!

242
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,673
We said we could
do this, right?

243
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:41,514
It's a long story.

244
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:44,383
Hmm.

245
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,352
[Maya humming]

246
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:49,054
How was your shower?

247
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:50,923
Absolutely lovely.

248
00:09:50,956 --> 00:09:53,025
Abuelita was very generous.

249
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:55,427
It's always nice to feel
clean on a day when it's

250
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,663
raining outside.

251
00:09:57,696 --> 00:09:58,697
Huh?

252
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,399
What does that have to
do with anything?

253
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:03,068
Oooh. Looks like
a lot of rain. Tsk.

254
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:06,105
I am sure glad I have a nice
waterproof rain slicker!

255
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,406
I have a raincoat, too.

256
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:10,075
It's in
the front closet.

257
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:11,977
Really?

258
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,579
Come on, Maya!

259
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:15,681
You have to let me
get my raincoat!

260
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:19,385
All right, all right--but only
because I like you, Miguel!

261
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,987
Gracias, Mayita.

262
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,356
Hey, kids--are you
all ready?

263
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:27,226
Ah, crossing the
tape already, huh?

264
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,227
Me?

265
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,528
Uh, no.

266
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:32,131
Maya and I said we would
stick to the deal.

267
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:33,532
Whoa! Doh!

268
00:10:33,565 --> 00:10:36,335
And we're going to!

269
00:10:36,368 --> 00:10:38,737
[Thunder]

270
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,906
You should have taken
the raincoat, Miguel.

271
00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:42,474
I said it was OK!

272
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:44,743
It's a matter of pride.

273
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:47,446
MAYA: Hola, Tito.
What's the plant for?

274
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:49,381
This is my friend.

275
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:50,582
Your friend?

276
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:53,352
But it's--it's--
it's a...

277
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:54,653
¡Es una planta!

278
00:10:54,686 --> 00:10:56,055
Si. My plant.

279
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,791
I call him Bravo!

280
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,825
Hmm.

281
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,393
Isn't he great?

282
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:02,428
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait,

283
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:04,797
let me get his raincoat.

284
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,172
Where is your
raincoat, Miguel?

285
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,274
Even Bravo has one!

286
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:17,009
Don't ask.

287
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:19,512
Oh.

288
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:26,485
Ms. Lim, can I please see
my family picture?

289
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:30,355
Why, of course, Tito.

290
00:11:30,388 --> 00:11:31,757
Here it is.

291
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,459
Gracias.

292
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,764
See? I put Bravo in my
family picture, too!

293
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:40,632
Uh, Bravo?

294
00:11:40,665 --> 00:11:41,800
Si.

295
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:44,303
My plant, Bravo!

296
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,905
Oh.

297
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,915
Here you go.
Here's your lunch.

298

MAYA: Hola, mama!

00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:10,129
Hey, there's a box of
Gus Lopez's empanadas

301
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,464
in the kitchen.

302
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:14,233
Gus' empanadas?!

303
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,836
For us?!

304
00:12:22,674 --> 00:12:24,376
Mmm.

305
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:26,345
Miguel.

306
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:27,379
Mmm.

308
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:32,417
Hello?

00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,052
Oh, hi! I thought
it might be you.

310
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:35,954
Is it Kylie?

311
00:12:35,987 --> 00:12:37,055
Shh. Shh. Shh.

312
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:41,326
Maya, if it's Kylie,
I want to talk to her.

313
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:44,163
Chrissy said you were
coming to dance class.

314
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,197
Miguel?

315
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,399
You want to talk
to Miguel?

316
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:51,703
So sorry, Kylie,
but Miguel can't, um,

317
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:54,273
well, he can't get to
the phone right now.

318
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:56,975
OK, sure,
I'll tell him. Buh-bye.

319
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:58,110
That was Kylie.

Ha.

That's our boy.

Quite an artist.

Si, mi amor.

00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:49,161
So are you guys still
sticking to your sides

337
00:13:49,194 --> 00:13:50,362
of the apartment?

338
00:13:50,395 --> 00:13:52,364
Haven't crossed
the tape once.

339
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:54,266
Does that mean
that it's working?

We're getting along
better than ever,
right, Miguel?

341
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,037
Right, Maya.

Hey, what's going
on with Tito?

plant everywhere.

Oh, that's Bravo.

It's his, um, friend.

Why does he have a plant?

347
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:10,415
I like meatloaf.

How about you?

349
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:16,388
So anyway, you guys have
to see our diorama.

350
00:14:16,421 --> 00:14:18,657
We did a Native
American pueblo.

started!

do it on separate sides

355
00:14:24,229 --> 00:14:26,365
of the apartment?

356
00:14:28,633 --> 00:14:31,436
So, ninos, are you
still keeping to
your own sides

357
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:32,738
of the apartment?

358
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:34,240
Of course, papi.

the butter, please?

partners for school,

and we have to work
together to make
something.

What do you have to make?

366
00:14:50,188 --> 00:14:53,125
Ah. Nothing big.
Just a diorama.

it's not that bad.

371
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,799
Not that bad?

372
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:03,201
Every year you kids
have to do a diorama,

373
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:05,304
and every year
it's a nightmare

374
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:08,573
for all the parents
in the neighborhood.

375
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:10,943
Uh, excuse me, papi.

376
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,144
Hola, son.

377
00:15:14,112 --> 00:15:17,316
Paco help!

378
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,551
Hey! Hey!

379
00:15:19,584 --> 00:15:20,585
Paco stuck!

380
00:15:20,618 --> 00:15:23,355
Ow! Paco!

381
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:28,961
Paco?

382
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,429
Give me that!

383
00:15:32,764 --> 00:15:34,233
Paco!

384
00:15:38,136 --> 00:15:40,539
Maya?

385
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,107
Um...

386
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,677
I guess I got carried away.

387
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,280
Those were a few
little accidents.

388
00:15:48,313 --> 00:15:51,550
Besides, we're older now
and need less help.

389
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,419
And you think you can do this
while staying on opposite

390
00:15:54,452 --> 00:15:57,456
sides of the apartment?

391
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:57,489
Yes!

392
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,458
Yes!

393
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,727
Ah.

394
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,463
Yeah. Uh-huh.

395
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,964
So here's my sketch.

396
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:07,499
It's an old
mining town.

397
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:10,135
¡Bueno! We can use
real coins for the silver,

398
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:12,838
and your old trains
for the tram cars!

399
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,473
Great. So how are we
going to make it

400
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,540
if we can't cross
the tape

401
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:17,542
to be on the same side
of the apartment?

402
00:16:17,575 --> 00:16:19,711
Ohh, good question!

403
00:16:19,744 --> 00:16:21,213
Paco want to help.

404
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:22,914
Not now, Paco.

405
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:25,017
It's pretty hard to make
a diorama without being

406
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,551
in the same place.

407
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:27,886
Paco help.

408
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:30,122
She said not now, Paco.

409
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,724
If only there were someone
who could help us out.

410
00:16:32,757 --> 00:16:34,226
Paco help.

411
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:37,496
Paco, please!
I need quiet to think.

412
00:16:39,397 --> 00:16:41,600
¡Eso es!
That's it!

413
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:43,935
Tito can help!

414
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:45,637
Good gravy!

415
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,173
If I need your drawings,
he can bring them to me.

416
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:50,542
If you need my research,
he can bring it to you.

417
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:52,511
What if he doesn't
want to do it?

418
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:53,745
Are you kidding?

419
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:56,548
What's more exciting
than helping us?

420
00:16:56,581 --> 00:16:58,917
I can think of
a few things.

421
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:03,989
¡Hola, Tito!

422
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:05,489
How's Bravo doing?

423
00:17:05,522 --> 00:17:08,893
Oh, he good, Abuelita.
I guess.

424
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:10,628
Is something
wrong, Tito?

425
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:13,498
Well, I guess
Bravo is OK,

426
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:16,701
but he cannot
play with me much.

427
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:17,835
Tell me, Tito.

428
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:20,204
Do you sometimes feel
a little lonely?

429
00:17:20,238 --> 00:17:21,640
Maybe like
it would be nice

430
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,575
to have a brother
or sister?

431
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:26,278
Well, maybe.

432
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,079
Is like Maya and Miguel.

433
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:31,016
Everything they do, they
have someone to share with.

434
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:34,586
You know, mijo, sometimes
sharing is not so easy.

435
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:38,857
But not having someone to
share with is not easy either.

436
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:39,891
Oh.

437
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:42,894

438
00:17:42,927 --> 00:17:44,930
Hello?

439
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,498
It's for you, mijo!

440
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:47,666
Huh?

441
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,504
OK, Tito, could you
bring me more newspaper

442
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:54,139
from Miguel's
half of the room?

443
00:17:54,172 --> 00:17:56,475
¡Si, prima! Yes!

444
00:17:58,643 --> 00:18:01,813
Here, Paco,
you watch Bravo!

445
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:03,949
What? Rar!

446
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:11,056
[Tito humming]

447
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:13,925
Tito, I need
some markers from Maya's
side of the apartment.

448
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,794
You got it!

449
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:17,829
Tito, tell Miguel
I need the scissors.

450
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:19,631
Coming right up!

451
00:18:22,233 --> 00:18:24,703
Tito, ask Maya for
the batteries, OK?

452
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,638
Okie-dokey!

453
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:27,672
Batteries?

454
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:29,774
Check.

455
00:18:29,807 --> 00:18:31,109
MAYA: Tito, I
need that book!

456
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:32,110
OK, here I go.

457
00:18:32,143 --> 00:18:33,111
I need the staple gun.

458
00:18:33,144 --> 00:18:35,380
Yes, um,
right on it.

459
00:18:35,413 --> 00:18:36,848
Newspapers, please!

460
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:38,584
[All talking at once]

461
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:42,087
Big shot.

462
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:46,892
Ooh. Too sticky.
I need more water.

463
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,427
Tito, I need your help.

464
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,829
Help!

465
00:18:50,862 --> 00:18:53,765
OK, now go out to the
living room and bring me
the train.

466
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:54,966
Paco bring train engine.

467
00:18:54,999 --> 00:18:57,736
Bueno. Gracias, Paquito.

468
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:58,737
Got it, chief.

469
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,139
Tito, I need more water.

470
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:04,309
Miguel, Paco coming!

471
00:19:04,342 --> 00:19:08,113
Whoops. [Squawk]
Woopsie!

472
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,848
Oh, no.

473
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,251
Paco?
Where's the train?

474
00:19:13,284 --> 00:19:15,053
Paco coming!

475
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:26,264
Aah!

476
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:27,633
Paco?

477
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,101
Are you in there?

478
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:31,403
Paco!

479
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,772
Paco? Paco!

480
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:35,807
Paco!

481
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,777
The paper mache
is getting hard!

482
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,412
What are we
going to do?

483
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:42,748
Help, somebody!

made out of paper mache!

Paco much better now!

503
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,770
So, mijitos, do you want to
tell me how Paco fell

504
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:40,305
into the paper mache?

505
00:20:40,338 --> 00:20:41,306
Um...

506

Um...

507
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:44,809
It was sort of
my fault, Abuelita.

508
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:46,711
It all started when
I suggested dividing

509
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:48,046
the apartment in half.

510
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,748
No, it was my fault.

511
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,750
I should have said we needed
to find a way to share

512
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,451
the same space.

513
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:56,021
It's just, well, it's hard
always having to share your

514
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:57,722
space with someone.

515
00:20:57,755 --> 00:20:58,723
Hmm?

516
00:20:58,756 --> 00:21:01,593
Yeah. I love Maya,
but sometimes I think

517
00:21:01,626 --> 00:21:05,830
it would be so much
easier to be an only child.

518
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:09,301
Is no so easy
being only child.

519
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:09,334
Huh?

520
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,803
Huh?

521
00:21:11,836 --> 00:21:14,806
Sometimes I wish I have
brother like you, Miguel,

522
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,841
or a sister like you, Maya.

523
00:21:16,874 --> 00:21:19,411
Oh.

524
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,781
Oh, Tito, I never
thought about it
that way before.

525
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:26,484
Yeah. Maybe we're luckier
than we think we are.

526
00:21:26,517 --> 00:21:28,153
Yeah.

But, Tito, even if you don't
have brothers or sisters,

529
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:36,661
you still have your
mama and papa,

530

and me for cousins!

531
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,632
Is true.

to divide my apartment
with a plant!

and I took the tape down

project together.

being an only child

of fun, too.
