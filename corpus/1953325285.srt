2
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,604
people talk about fate...

3
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,646
How everything happens
for a reason.

4
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,556
But I never believed that.

5
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,917
I can't find a single reason
why I deserve a second chance.

6
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,557
Today is the day that I die.

7
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:12,950
Slide it away.

8
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:17,250
I said fucking
slide it away now.

9
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,464
Nighty night, asshole.

10
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,612
Go!

11
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:48,216
Fuck!

12
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:53,049
Fuck!

13
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,390
I need you to call 9-1-1.

14
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:56,892
Tell them detective
Callahan's in pursuit.

15
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,293
No, don't leave me.

16
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,592
He's done this before.

17
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,066
I'm not going to let him do it again.
Call it in!

18
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,357
Motherfucker.

19
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,246
Fucking...

20
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,431
Arrogant prick.

21
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,002
You come up with anything?

22
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:24,167
Yeah, found these
under his mattress.

23
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,674
He was keeping mementos.

24
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,110
Mm-hmm. You want to
rattle his cage?

25
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,511
Nah, give it to scanlon.

26
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:30,844
You afraid you might blow it?

27
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,314
I just thought if
you drop the ball,

28
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,080
I'm in reserve to clean it up.

29
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,550
- Sorry, what was that?
- Lieutenant,

30
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,146
district attorney asked
loughlin to sit in on this one.

31
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,715
- Is it true?
- Randall mcalister.

32
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:42,556
14 years on the job.

33
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,186
Have you notified
internal affairs?

34
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:47,528
Our collar, our case.

35
00:04:47,554 --> 00:04:49,998
Yeah, it's best to keep
these things in-house.

36
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:51,559
Make it airtight.

37
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,832
- Airtight?
- Go get 'em, sluggo.

38
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:01,008
So, you got a thing
for brunettes, huh?

39
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,377
Look what we found.

40
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:04,245
Look at that.

41
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,308
You know what? It's
late, I'm tired,

42
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,943
and I got to go walk my dog,

43
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,012
so why don't you just keep
this really simple, okay?

44
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:12,487
You plead guilty to six counts

45
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:14,753
of sexual assault
in the first degree

46
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,192
to be served consecutively,

47
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:20,095
and we'll spare your family
the embarrassment of a trial.

48
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,758
Or option number two,

49
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,098
he could plead down to
six lesser charges,

50
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:26,934
to be served concurrently in
a minimum-security facility.

51
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,065
Wow, you got some balls
there, counselor.

52
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,768
For 14 years, my client

53
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,970
was an exemplary member of
this police department,

54
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,070
so why would he
hypothetically go astray?

55
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,342
- Who gives a shit?
- Where the hell is this going?

56
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,341
About a year ago, my client's
wife of 10 years left him.

57
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,547
Busted my ass for that woman.

58
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,250
Gave her everything
she ever wanted.

59
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,122
So you married an
ungrateful bitch.

60
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:51,618
Wow. Welcome to the club.

61
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,756
After his wife abandoned him,

62
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:56,597
my client divulged
his extreme feelings

63
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:57,727
to your department shrink.

64
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:58,861
News flash, asshole.

65
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,064
He didn't rape his wife.

66
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:01,595
Didn't he?

67
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,307
Jesus.

68
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:08,575
All the women look
like his ex-wife.

69
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,748
Six women sexually assaulted
by a police officer,

70
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:20,417
and you could have prevented it?
Fallout's going to be immeasurable.

71
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,154
Only if it becomes
public knowledge.

72
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,492
Wait a minute. Captain,
you're not seriously thinking

73
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:26,428
of cutting a deal with this
piece of shit, are you?

74
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,592
- Take a breath.
- What do you think I was doing?

75
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:31,032
You need to take a deep breath
and think long and hard

76
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,500
about what course
of action is best

77
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,062
for the preservation of this
department's reputation.

78
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:37,405
For once, detective.

79
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,201
Well, anyways, mm-hmm, yeah.

80
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:11,139
Oh, my God, so we had
such an awesome time.

81
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:12,472
Well, I asked her,

82
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,308
but she said she had
to think about it.

83
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:16,974
Yeah, really. So
who else is going?

84
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:20,284
Is mark going to be there?

85
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:22,915
He's okay, I guess.

86
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,388
Why, did he say
something about me?

87
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,881
Hold on a second, Jenny.

88
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,018
What?

89
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,687
Who's mark?

90
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,287
Just a boy from school.

91
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,290
Five minutes.

92
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,200
Okay. Bye.

93
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,336
Sorry. That was my dad.

94
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:43,338
He's like, "who's mark?"

95
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:47,175
So, anyway... so did he
say anything about me?

96
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,110
Hi.

97
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,823
Did you just talk to lanie?

98
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:07,956
Yeah. Who's mark?

99
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,924
It's just a boy.

100
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,071
Mm-hmm.

101
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,572
How you feeling?

102
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,008
Tired.

103
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,682
Do you believe in fate?

104
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,689
I thought I did.

105
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,093
It's a beautiful family.

106
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,095
You got a lot to
be thankful for.

107
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,758
If I were you,

108
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,325
I'd consider myself the
luckiest man on the planet.

109
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,399
Wipe the slate.

110
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,937
Oh, that guy who saved you...

111
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,674
What about him?

112
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,238
You tell me.

113
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,750
He was the only witness
to what really went down.

114
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,621
I don't remember
anything about him.

115
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:12,746
Really?

116
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:15,720
Ah, well.

117
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,555
Too bad.

118
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,906
Been meaning to come see you.

119
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,606
Cal, the church isn't just

120
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,706
for the bad times.

121
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,410
Yeah, I know.

122
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,480
What about your nightmares?

123
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,651
Yeah, still having those.

124
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,882
I don't know, father.

125
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,128
I disrespected the
woman that I love,

126
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,760
violated my oath to
protect and serve.

127
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,632
Just don't know why I
got a second chance.

128
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,032
Or who've I got to
thank for that chance.

129
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,734
This good samaritan,

130
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,835
I'm sure the good lord will
cross your paths someday.

131
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,903
I hope so.

132
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:10,437
Are you still drinking?

133
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,744
No.

134
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,614
I've been sober for
almost two years,

135
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,278
ever since the shooting.

136
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,285
Can't tell you I'm not
craving it, though.

137
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,119
Hey, I mean it.

138
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,246
David Callahan?

139
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,741
Yeah?

140
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,721
You don't remember me?

141
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:55,915
No. How would I know you?

142
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:59,726
My name is Sergei,
Sergei dronov.

143
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,962
I'm sorry. How do
we know each other?

144
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,196
We met once before...

145
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,798
On the corner of
water and frontage.

146
00:12:26,145 --> 00:12:27,954
Hey!

147
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,389
Hey!

148
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,260
Hang in there, buddy. You're
going to be just fine.

149
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,136
My wife, tell her I'm sorry.

150
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:44,937
Tell her yourself, okay?

151
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,204
Please.

152
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:48,192
You hear those sirens?
They'll be here any second.

153
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,976
Just hold on, okay?

154
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,677
So why'd you leave?

155
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:59,213
You just vanished.

156
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:02,556
I didn't know who you were or
what you were involved in.

157
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,529
I went on TV. I was begging
for somebody to come forward.

158
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,657
Where I come from,

159
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,566
it is best not to get
involved with the police.

160
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:14,834
I didn't even tell my wife about
what happened that night.

161
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:16,067
So why now?

162
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,044
Because of this.

163
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:13,928
Yeah? Larussa.

164
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,059
- Hey, lieu, it's Cal. You busy?
- No. What's up?

165
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,865
I just got into a
little Fender bender.

166
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,427
You all right?

167
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,633
I'm fine.

168
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,436
Hey, I lost the guy's
business card, though.

169
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,002
You got a name?

170
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,911
His name was Sergei dronov.

171
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:31,813
Hold on. What? Say it again.

172
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,545
Sergei dronov.

173
00:14:33,573 --> 00:14:36,281
Dronov. D-r-o-n-o-v, I think.

174
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:38,118
Yeah, I got it. I
got an address.

175
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:39,987
It's 423 gladstone.

176
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:41,252
Phone number also.
You want it?

177
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,062
I didn't even tell my wife

178
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:49,589
about what happened that night.

179
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,407
My daughter zhanna...

180
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:40,012
I found this journal when I was
cleaning out her apartment.

181
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,959
Will you help me?

182
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,834
I've got to get a job.

183
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,636
The scholarship isn't enough to support me.
Feeling of loneliness.

184
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:06,384
This is the third time a teacher
asked me why I don't have an accent.

185
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,072
Just because I have a
weird Russian name.

186
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,261
I came here when I was two.
Can't say hello in Russian.

187
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,509
This was the worst date ever.

188
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:13,539
I have to do better for
mom and dad's sake.

189
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,483
These men... the correct
word is these "boys."

190
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,351
I'm such an idiot.
All of us, so young.

191
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:19,686
They sacrificed everything for
me to have a better life.

192
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:21,714
Some even younger than me.
What am I thinking?

193
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,590
I want to tell them
to save themselves.

194
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,093
I was not happy about.
Get out.

195
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,189
My mom wouldn't stop crying.
Began writing a paper

196
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,427
for my social
anthropology class.

197
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,197
The assignment was to
analyze a cultural ritual.

198
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:34,330
I picked a safe topic...

199
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,930
Funerals.

200
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:38,339
But if I had any guts,

201
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,867
I would have written about
how I pay for school.

202
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:48,017
I take off my clothes for money.

203
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,951
Walking through the curtain
for the first time

204
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:55,516
was the hardest thing
I've ever done.

205
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:59,793
The closer I got,

206
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:02,595
the more I wanted to turn
and never stop running.

207
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,927
For the first time
on our stage,

208
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,531
introducing the
beautiful roxy.

209
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,254
Hey, honey.

210
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,485
Hi, dad.

211
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,390
I'm making you breakfast.

212
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,521
Can I have cereal?

213
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,995
No. That's just sugar.
You always eat cereal.

214
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,126
Today we're going to have some eggs...
Protein.

215
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,234
- Hello.
- Whoa.

216
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:42,068
- Good morning, honey.
- Trying to bulk me up?

217
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:44,038
No, I want you to sit down.
Sit down.

218
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,973
I'm making my two
gals breakfast today.

219
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,978
Your eggs are coming right up.

220
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,252
Three shots in the chest.

221
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,323
Stumbled here to bleed out.

222
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:23,140
I see nothing but anger
in so many eyes.

223
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,940
I wonder how they treat
their women in their lives

224
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,449
as I let my thoughts drift

225
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,683
to someplace peaceful
and far away.

226
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,390
Still, they're not all bad.

227
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,461
Some are just lonely

228
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,693
and want nothing
more than a smile,

229
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:46,693
someone to recognize
that they exist.

230
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,551
Hey.

231
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:04,680
Hey.

232
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,816
Mom had to run some errands.
You got me today.

233
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:12,022
- How was school?
- Boring.

234
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:14,622
- Boring?
- Yeah. Isn't that what it usually is?

235
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,463
I don't know what
school was like

236
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,332
when you were a kid a
million years ago.

237
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:22,634
- Seat belt.
- Yes, sir.

238
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,107
I never walked
to my car alone.

239
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,177
It was against the rules,

240
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,206
but it was late, and I didn't
feel like waiting around.

241
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,949
He was waiting for
me at my car.

242
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,357
I knew his face. He was
a regular at the club.

243
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,989
The other dancers
call him angel.

244
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:51,134
He used to draw me.

245
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,862
I thought it was
sweet at the time.

246
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,413
Help me, please!

247
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:22,894
I lay awake at night

248
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,866
and tell myself I'm
lucky to be alive

249
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,599
and it's okay that I
didn't report it.

250
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,766
The police wouldn't
have believed me.

251
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,675
I'm a stripper. I
was asking for it.

252
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,671
I was not going to subject
myself to any more humiliation.

253
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,518
Sometimes I believe my excuses

254
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:46,352
long enough to drift
off to sleep.

255
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,958
But he's always waiting
in my nightmares.

256
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,457
He'll never let me forget

257
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:58,059
that I am helpless and pathetic

258
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,660
and he has control.

259
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:04,702
It makes me so angry,

260
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,801
more than what he did to me

261
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:10,277
or what he took from me,

262
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,441
what I didn't do in return.

263
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,846
I didn't stop him from
hurting anyone else.

264
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:27,656
He's still out there...

265
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,632
Ready to strike again.

266
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:49,511
Oleg...

267
00:21:51,377 --> 00:21:54,051
Ladies, I know one
after-hours club,

268
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,651
the best one, 'cause
you're the best.

269
00:21:56,682 --> 00:21:58,525

- I need to talk to you, please.

325
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,031
Give me a second.

326
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:25,592
I owe oleg a lot of money

327
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:27,568
for bringing me here,

328
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:29,595
but you know

329
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:31,605
I don't have such money.

330
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:34,008
I can never repay him.

331
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,240
So what do you want me
to do about it, babe?

332
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,544
You're a cop. You can help me.

333
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,379
Please.

334
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:42,909
Oleg's got something going,

335
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:44,351
something big.

336
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,354
Oleg's got something
going for what, for me?

337
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,789
What am I getting out of it?

338
00:25:48,814 --> 00:25:52,259
You take oleg, take the money,

339
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:56,255
then help me get
out of this place.

340
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,427
If it's so big,

341
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:00,367
Walker must know
about it, honey.

342
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,269
No. No.

343
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,830
It's oleg's deal.

344
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:07,503
Royce Walker doesn't
know about it.

345
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:09,443
Cal, help me.

346
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:11,812
I just want to get
away from here.

347
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:13,714
Okay, I'll think about it, okay?

348
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:16,150
But I don't want to talk here.
I'll talk later to you,

349
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,984
when I'm not so high.

350
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:19,978
Relax.

351
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:23,721
Relax, Katya. Jesus Christ.

352
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,888
Why aren't I getting
any lap dances?

353
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:28,922
I mean, I want some
fucking lap dancing.

354
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,328
Hey.

355
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,304
Hey. Hey.

356
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,808
Oh, my God.

357
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,989
You okay with that?

358
00:26:56,014 --> 00:26:57,618
It's okay, Freddie.

359
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:06,236
Here's my card.

360
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,104
I need your help, Katya.

361
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,871
My help?

362
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:15,071
Where have you been
when I needed you?

363
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,740
I'm sorry, okay? I
had some problems.

364
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,510
I was a different
person back then.

365
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,677
It was a different time.

366
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,744
- I'll make some calls...
- It's too late, Cal.

367
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,882
- I can help you now.
- I'm deep into this shit now.

368
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,516
Look...

369
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:32,226
I need some information
on the guy in the club

370
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,128
that's sketching pictures
of all the girls.

371
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,598
You know who I'm talking about?

372
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:39,265
Of course. We all do.

373
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,799
I need his real name.

374
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,270
Find out yourself,

375
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:47,868
piece of shit.

376
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:08,621
Come on.

377
00:28:08,654 --> 00:28:11,632
Hey, hey. It's angel, right?

378
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:13,534
Why are you leaving so soon?

379
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:16,665
Huh? Come get a drink with me, baby.
Come on.

380
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:19,199
That's so rude.

381
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:40,154
Nothing in name for 613 n4l.

382
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,290
You sure it's a local plate?

383
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:43,797
That's what it says.

384
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:45,995
- Not in the system.
- Thanks.

385
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,330
Yeah, right.

386
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,893
I understand. It's just
that I just got home.

387
00:29:53,926 --> 00:29:55,903
You know, it's really
fucking late at night.

388
00:29:55,928 --> 00:29:57,635
I mean, I don't...

389
00:29:57,663 --> 00:30:00,166
Okay. All right, where
do you want me to go?

390
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,007

You look like a piece of shit.

414
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:15,128
Pull the strings

415
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,394

00:34:17,422 --> 00:34:18,730

417
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,978
Yeah?

418
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,915
Where are you?

419
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,816
I'm working, okay?

420
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,184
You're lying to me.

421
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:40,746
I told you I'm in the middle
of a fucking investigation.

422
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,588
I keep telling myself that
you're going to finally

423
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:43,990
realize what you're
doing to yourself...

424
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,756
- What do you think I'm doing?
- ...To us,

425
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,627
and you're going to
care enough to stop,

426
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:48,858
but you want to know what?

427
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,093
You're never going
to care enough.

428
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,327
What are you saying?

429
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:54,098
Your daughter is growing up
without a fucking father!

430
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,264
Fuck!

431
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,272
Hey, buddy.

432
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,938
Hey, oleg.

433
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:06,108
- I was looking for you.
- Yeah? What's up?

434
00:35:06,138 --> 00:35:07,776
Let's go for a ride.

435
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,447
You going to tell me
where we're going, oleg?

436
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:14,651
Pull over right here.

437
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:15,817
- Here?
- Here.

438
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,395
It's between you and me.

439
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,058
Okay.

440
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,867
20 keys of uncut powder

441
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:29,964
coming on the long island ferry.

442
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:32,405
I'm going to give you one key.

443
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,502
It's going to keep you happy
for a very long time, eh?

444
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,280
I'm listening.

445
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,909
We are waiting for
two black guys.

446
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,549
I was told they're going to
be driving a red mustang.

447
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:48,785
Red mustang, eh?

448
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,659
We're going to be out here?
Why?

449
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,722
Everyone's so exposed
out here like this.

450
00:35:55,754 --> 00:35:58,200
- I don't see a boat at all.
- Well, what can I do?

451
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:03,232
So you going to steal my
deal, and you thought

452
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,070
you gonna fucking
tell her what to do?

453
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,035
I know what Katya tell you.

454
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,441
I know you want to rob my deal.

455
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:12,572
We are waiting for
two black guys.

456
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,941
I was told they're going to
be driving a red mustang.

457
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:21,206
I don't do business
like this, man.

458
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,877
You paid us for one
fucking thing,

459
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,410
and one thing in
particular, man.

460
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,444
I'm serious. What you got
us out here doing, man?

461
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,287
I don't know what's going on.
You ain't here.

462
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:30,850
Got my man here sitting on
this in the fucking trunk.

463
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:36,062
I ain't playing no fucking games
out here and shit right now.

464
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,091
We in a place where I don't
fucking know what's going on.

465
00:37:39,124 --> 00:37:41,297
This dude playing
games right now.

466
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:43,533
Look, you paid us to bring
it up, and that's all.

467
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,802
I ain't trying to sit on
this shit all night, man.

468
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:49,676
Look, man, that ain't
going to work.

469
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:52,181
I ain't feeling this
right now, man, huh?

470
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:57,250
- Hey, man, what did he say?
- This motherfucker

471
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,277
talking about he don't know
where the other dude at.

472
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:00,517
Well, he going to meet us

473
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,149
over at artisan park
in, like, 15 minutes.

474
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,182
See? This the shit I'm
talking about, man.

475
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:05,990
- Yo, man. Man, let's go.
- Better be there.

476
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:29,049
- Hey, why not?
- Come on, lanie.

477
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:30,246
Mom, please?

478
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:32,686
Enough with this party.

479
00:38:32,711 --> 00:38:35,214
- Have you seen this?
- Huh?

480
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,487
It's the third quarter her
grades have dropped in a row.

481
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,324
But, mom, it has
nothing to do with it.

482
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:40,760
Can you just talk
to him, please?

483
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,423
Talk to me about what?

484
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:43,694
So what are we talking about?

485
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:47,295
Jenny's having a slumber
party, but it's coed,

486
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,827
- so it's never going to happen.
- Coed?

487
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,500
- So let me guess. Mark's going?
- Dad!

488
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,441
To tell you the truth, these
grades are garbage. No party.

489
00:38:54,466 --> 00:38:56,468
You guys were never kids.
It's so annoying.

490
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,742
- Need to do better in school, honey.
- Whatever!

491
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:06,486
- Maybe we should get her a tutor.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

492
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,320
Can you help me out with that?
'Cause I...

493
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:11,883
Yeah.

494
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:14,255
Hold on one sec.

495
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:16,492
I got to take this, babe.
Then I got to change.

496
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,058
Yeah, go.

497
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:38,546
What we looking at, brogan?

498
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:41,250
Darwinism. Urban
survival of the fittest.

499
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,756
How did it go down?

500
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:44,885
Drive-by.

501
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:47,157
As luck would have it,
we caught the shooter.

502
00:39:47,185 --> 00:39:48,687
Any witnesses?

503
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,197
Ah, their friend got grazed.

504
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,327
He claims he didn't see
who fired the shots.

505
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,929
Now let me ask him
a few questions.

506
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:08,012
Excuse me. Thanks, guys.

507
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,382
I'll talk to him.

508
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:19,526
Man, what the fuck
is your problem?

509
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:21,588
You don't remember me, do you?

510
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,395
Why would I?

511
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:25,924
Let me refresh your memory.

512
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,298
You remember this? Huh?

513
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:35,333
Shit!

514
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,107
Shit! What the fuck, man?

515
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,944
Shit's in the frame.
Just be cool, man.

516
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,472
Be cool? Man, what the fuck?

517
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,280
Can't be fucking serious.

518
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,319
You boys in a hurry?

519
00:40:50,348 --> 00:40:52,350
I'm sorry about that, officer.
I just got the car.

520
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,226
I ain't used to the power.

521
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,960
You wouldn't happen to
have any drugs or alcohol

522
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:02,028
- in here now, would you?
- No, sir, officer.

523
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,536
No?

524
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,666
You ain't lying to
me now, are you?

525
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:08,541
- Aw, come on, man.
- No, sir.

526
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,977
Well, you don't mind if I
take a look then, do you?

527
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:13,278
Step out of the vehicle. Thanks.

528
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,840
We just want to
go home, officer.

529
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:18,342
Yeah, I know. I said
step out of the vehicle.

530
00:41:18,376 --> 00:41:22,347
Hey, I said step out of
the vehicle now. Get out.

531
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,226
Hey, what are you doing?

532
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:30,895
Yo, man, what the fuck?

533
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,458
Why you shoot him for?

534
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,696
I'm going to handle this shit.

535
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:35,500
You ain't have to
fucking shoot him!

536
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:37,370
Get the fuck in the car, man.

537
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:41,473
Look, I don't know
nothing about that, man.

538
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,501
- Yeah?
- Hey, shit, man.

539
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:44,741
Come on. Fucking...

540
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:48,147
- Shut up and come here.
- God damn.

541
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,709
It's just you and me
talking right now, okay?

542
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:53,245
But I can change in a
heartbeat, so it's up to you.

543
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:55,485
Yeah.

544
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,515
I remember seeing you on TV,

545
00:41:57,549 --> 00:41:59,859
everybody all
weepy-eyed and shit,

546
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,524
like you some kind
of fucking hero.

547
00:42:02,554 --> 00:42:04,556
I know the truth, motherfucker.

548
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,833
Just some junkie looking
to shake us down.

549
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,570
I thought long and hard

550
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:15,043
about what I'd do to you
if I ever saw you again.

551
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:17,738
At first, I wanted
to put a bullet

552
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:20,511
right through your
fucking skull.

553
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,779
After a while, I realized...

554
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:26,016
I realized you saved
my life that night,

555
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,453
so I want to repay the favor.

556
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:29,185
Give me your wallet.

557
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:30,690
Give you my wallet?

558
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:31,955
Give it to me.

559
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:39,629
Ellis dracut. All right.

560
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:42,194
Here's how it's
going to go down.

561
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,469
We caught the guy that
shot your friends.

562
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,807
Tomorrow his lawyer's going to
get an anonymous phone call

563
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:51,336
- saying that you're willing to testify.
- That's bullshit.

564
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:52,745
It's not going to happen,

565
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,750
'cause you're not
going to be here.

566
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,751
Take this. Take it.

567
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:01,279
I want you buy a
ticket, train ticket.

568
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:04,757
You go to any city where
you don't know anybody.

569
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:08,025
Go someplace where you
can start a new life.

570
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,692
Do anything but what
you're doing here now.

571
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:19,966
You believe in
redemption, father?

572
00:43:19,997 --> 00:43:23,911
Well, this path would never
have chosen me if I didn't.

573
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:26,978
So you think everyone
can be saved?

574
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,419
Well...

575
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,188
I would rather hear your
thoughts on the subject.

576
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:39,786
You know the worst
thing about homicide?

577
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,795
We always get there
after the fact.

578
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,065
You have no idea how
that eats at you.

579
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,171
I'm tracking a suspect.

580
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:57,435
Seems as though he's already ruined
one young girl's life and her family.

581
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:02,141
I can see the way he
was looking at 'em.

582
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,619
I knew exactly what
he was thinking.

583
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:10,189
This time, I'm not
going to be too late.

584
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:17,892
I'll pray for you, David.

585
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:23,799
Forensics.

586
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,204
It's Cal.

587
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,173
Got a minute to do
a search for me?

588
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:28,438
Depends what you're looking for.

589
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:29,501
Serial predator,

590
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:31,707
white male, mid to late 30s.

591
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:33,738
Sexual assaults.

592
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:37,175
Younger girls.

593
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:38,812
See if we've got
any cases reported

594
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,345
over the past six months.

595
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:41,823
That's all I've got to go on?

596
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:47,857
- Drawings.
- Come again?

597
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,862
He's doing drawings of them.

598
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,889
That's how he's getting
them to drop their guard,

599
00:44:51,923 --> 00:44:54,400
by sketching the victims' faces.

600
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:56,268
Okay. Tell you what I find.

601
00:44:56,294 --> 00:44:57,398
Thanks.

602
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:02,401
What's up, lieu?

603
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,669
At the bar, and I'll
see you inside.

604
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,106
We'll finish this off
today, all right?

605
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:10,109
Hey, lieu, what couldn't
you tell me on the phone?

606
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:11,636
Inside.

607
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:18,076
Perp's name is oleg emelyaenko.

608
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:19,144
Know him?

609
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:20,280
No.

610
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,629
I want you to see this.

611
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,029
Is this her place?

612
00:46:30,054 --> 00:46:33,194
No, the apartment belongs to
the suspect... emelyaenko.

613
00:46:39,564 --> 00:46:42,238
Come here a second.

614
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,342
Thing is, Cal,

615
00:46:50,374 --> 00:46:53,651
she was killed attempting
to make a phone call.

616
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:56,215
The card in her hand was yours,

617
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:58,887
so, I mean, you did know her,

618
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,759
anyway, didn't you?

619
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:02,321
- Yeah, I knew her, lieu.
- Right.

620
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:04,560
Yeah. Looks like she
burnt the toast, right?

621
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:06,398
So you think this is real
funny, huh, scanlon?

622
00:47:06,424 --> 00:47:07,425
It's all right.

623
00:47:11,596 --> 00:47:13,769
Listen, he's having
a bad day, huh?

624
00:47:13,798 --> 00:47:15,436
Get your job done,
detective, all right?

625
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:17,605
'Cause a whore's a whore.

626
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:19,239
Piece of work you are, huh?

627
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,375
What, do you have no, like,
social skills or what?

628
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,986
Just focus on those
fingerprints right there.

629
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:30,492
Look, I need to
get samples of...

630
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,199
It's between you and me.

631
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:48,075
Will you help me?

632
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:53,245
I'd like to, but...

633
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:54,614
Without your daughter

634
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:56,141
to validate the contents
of this journal,

635
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:59,382
there's no case. D.A.
Won't file charges.

636
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:03,420
I am not looking for a trial.

637
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:07,319
There are just some people

638
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:09,627
the world would be
better off without.

639
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:52,306
Hey, dad.

640
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:56,807
Can I talk to you
about something?

641
00:48:56,834 --> 00:48:58,177
Sure.

642
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:05,309
What's going on?

643
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,283
There's someone...

644
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:14,853
I'm embarrassed to tell you,
but I need your advice.

645
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,228
Someone who?

646
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,426
Someone at school.

647
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,900
Someone who goes to your school
or someone you saw at school?

648
00:49:20,925 --> 00:49:23,098
What's the difference?

649
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:26,097
Honey, I love you,

650
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,607
and I'm here to protect you.

651
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,272
I need to know if
something happened.

652
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,245
I know.

653
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,648
Well, this someone at
school, did he hurt you?

654
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:36,947
- Did somebody hurt you?
- What?

655
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,147
- Just tell me. Then I can...
- What's wrong with you?

656
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:41,383
Can't you stop being a cop
for, like, five minutes?

657
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:43,983
No, I just want to know
what you're talking about.

658
00:49:50,788 --> 00:49:52,199

Zhanna dronov,

684
00:52:34,185 --> 00:52:35,186
you remember her?

685
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,421
Yeah.

686
00:52:38,556 --> 00:52:39,557
Yeah, wha...

687
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,591
Don't fucking move.

688
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:41,864
Whoa. Hold on, man.

689
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,064
Hold on a second.

690
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:45,004
Get on your knees.

691
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,835
So you still don't
know, do you?

692
00:52:48,866 --> 00:52:50,342
Get on your fucking knees now.

693
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,904
Okay, man. Okay. All right.

694
00:52:52,937 --> 00:52:54,245
I know who you are.

695
00:52:57,308 --> 00:52:59,151
You and me, we're a lot alike.

696
00:53:01,078 --> 00:53:02,682

00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:05,353

something to you, okay?

698
00:53:09,053 --> 00:53:10,896

you something, okay?

699
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:13,265
Nah, this is over, man.

700
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,429
Trust me. Let me reach
into my pocket,

00:53:15,459 --> 00:53:17,870

- Hello.
- Sergei.

708
00:54:21,292 --> 00:54:23,397
Who is this?

709
00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:25,270
Did you know he was a cop?

710
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:28,003
Who was a cop? Who
the hell is this?

711
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:30,807
I'm in front of your
fucking house, man.

712
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:38,049
Listen, asshole, I'm
about to call the cops,

713
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:41,022
so you'd better get
the hell out of here.

714
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:42,909
Hey, lieu. You called for me?

715
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:46,217
Yeah, I did, hour
and a half ago.

716
00:55:47,544 --> 00:55:49,785
Guess you been occupied.

717
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:52,259
- So what's going on?
- Captain wants to see you.

718
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,160
Making my life miserable.

719
00:56:06,864 --> 00:56:09,401
The prodigal has returned.

720
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:11,970
Why don't you grab yourself a
cup of coffee, lieutenant?

721
00:56:12,002 --> 00:56:14,004
Oh, I think it might
be useful if I...

722
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,641
Give me 10 with him alone.

723
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,447
Sit down.

724
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:20,944
Hey, captain.

725
00:56:27,651 --> 00:56:29,127
His name was Nicholas logue,

726
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:31,894
shot and killed outside
his apartment last night.

727
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:38,303
Did you know him?

728
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:40,137
No.

729
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:43,411
Nah.

730
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:47,471
Are you sure?

731
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:49,506
Well, yeah. How
would I know him?

732
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:53,884
'Cause he was one of ours,

733
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,891
worked out of the 77th.

734
00:56:57,848 --> 00:56:59,020
Mint?

735
00:57:02,186 --> 00:57:03,187
Thanks.

736
00:57:14,365 --> 00:57:15,969
How you feeling?

737
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:19,342
I'm all right.

738
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:25,542
'Cause I was thinking

739
00:57:25,576 --> 00:57:27,180
of having you run
primary on this.

740
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:30,422
Are you? Why me?

741
00:57:33,717 --> 00:57:35,287
Our boy here may
have been involved

742
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:38,732
in some embarrassing
extracurricular activities.

743
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:41,594
And if anyone
understands the concept

744
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:44,265
of discretion being the
better part of valor,

745
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:47,206
that would be you,

746
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:48,301
wouldn't it, detective?

747
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:53,203
Okay, cap.

748
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,047
- Hey, Callahan.
- Yeah?

749
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,150
You might need these.

750
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:15,097
So you're going to hand off

751
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,661
everything you got to
him, you understand?

752
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:18,764
- Yeah.
- With no bullshit, right?

753
00:58:18,796 --> 00:58:21,106
Remember to come up on it...
What are you looking at?

754
00:58:21,131 --> 00:58:23,668
What the fuck you laughing at?
All right.

755
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:24,940
- Listen to me.
- I got it.

756
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:27,408
I know you got it, but don't fuck
around on this. You hear me?

757
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:31,450
- Hey, sluggo.
- Yeah.

758
00:58:31,475 --> 00:58:33,716
- I'm not kidding.
- All right.

759
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:36,121
You know, you look
like shit, Callahan.

760
00:58:36,146 --> 00:58:37,556
That's a slain officer
in there, huh?

761
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:38,582
You might want to think

762
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:40,025
about cleaning up
before you go inside.

763
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,460
Why don't you just
back off, scanlon?

764
00:58:41,485 --> 00:58:43,089
I'm in no mood for
you right now.

765
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,326
You really just pulled the rug

766
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,924
right out underneath
me on this one.

767
00:58:45,956 --> 00:58:47,629
What the fuck are
you talking about?

768
00:58:47,658 --> 00:58:49,194
The lieutenant, he
assigns me the case.

769
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:51,433
I find out this morning I'm
supposed to report to you.

770
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,270
No, it was the captain's call.

771
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:54,502
Fucking idiot.

772
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:56,568
Yeah, I can still smell
his balls on your breath.

773
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,137
- What the fuck?
- Fuck you!

774
00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:00,739
- Piece of shit, you...
- Scanlon.

775
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:02,714
- Get off!
- You going to do this here?

776
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,980
- Back off, both of you.
- We're not done, Callahan.

777
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,817
God damn it. What the
hell is wrong with you?

778
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:09,051
And look where you are, for
Christ's sake, you morons.

779
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:10,285
What are you, in third grade?

780
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:11,723
- Yeah, grow up.
- Talk to him, lieu.

781
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:13,386
- Get out of here.
- Fucking idiot.

782
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:18,260
You got to get your
shit in order.

783
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:20,290
You hear me? You going
to take this thing over,

784
00:59:20,324 --> 00:59:22,326
be prepared for the fact,
you walk in that room,

785
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:24,836
people are gonna look to you for answers.
You got 'em? Huh?

786
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,805
Yeah.

787
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:28,400
All right.

788
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:29,536
We found a 9mm

789
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,943
with the serial numbers
filed off near the body.

790
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:34,244
Brogan's running it
through ballistics now.

791
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,808
Did you know logue, lieu?

792
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,649
No, I didn't.

793
00:59:40,277 --> 00:59:41,984
Scanlon talked to
some of the guys

794
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:44,322
over at the 77th. They
said that he was having

795
00:59:44,348 --> 00:59:47,852
emotional problems. Ah, yeah,
he was drinking too much.

796
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:50,829
Wife kicked him out, filed
a restraining order.

797
00:59:50,854 --> 00:59:52,390
Familiar stuff.

798
00:59:53,991 --> 00:59:55,800
All right, come on.

799
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:57,806
- I'm good.
- Go pay respects.

800
01:00:34,264 --> 01:00:35,834
I'm Jake larussa.

801
01:01:14,538 --> 01:01:15,539
Get going.

802
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,965
Mr. dronov.

803
01:02:06,323 --> 01:02:08,166
- Yes?
- Sergei dronov?

804
01:02:10,694 --> 01:02:12,367
What do you want?

805
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:13,739
I'm a detective.

806
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:17,902
I was wondering if I could have a few
moments to talk about your daughter.

807
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:25,910
Around back. I don't
want to upset my wife.

808
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,351
So why are you interested
in my daughter?

809
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:32,951
It's a routine follow-up.

810
01:02:32,983 --> 01:02:34,960
Just want to make sure
the original officers

811
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:36,987
did a thorough investigation.

812
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,057
I don't know what they
could have missed.

813
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:42,499
Zhanna overdosed.

814
01:02:42,526 --> 01:02:45,473
What? It wasn't a suicide?

815
01:02:47,898 --> 01:02:49,875
I guess if you shoot
junk into your arms,

816
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,709
you can't be a
very happy person.

817
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:55,507
But I didn't think she
intended to take her life.

818
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:01,478
You ever seen this man?

819
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:09,060
Yeah. I met him.

820
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:12,260
Zhanna brought him by.

821
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:15,200
I thought all the men
in her life are losers,

822
01:03:15,225 --> 01:03:17,262
but she said he was different.

823
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:20,104
They were going to
get clean together.

824
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:21,905
They met at the club.

825
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,971
I didn't like it,

826
01:03:25,001 --> 01:03:27,913
but I guess it was a better
way to support her habit

827
01:03:27,938 --> 01:03:30,145
than selling her
body on the street.

828
01:03:31,842 --> 01:03:33,981
Do you know if zhanna
kept a journal?

829
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,254
She did.

830
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,486
I was the one that cleaned
out her apartment, but...

831
01:03:44,254 --> 01:03:45,790
I never found it.

832
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:51,101
I made my peace with God.

833
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,174
There are some things in
this world that a father...

834
01:03:59,135 --> 01:04:00,546
Should never know.

835
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:07,712
Well, I'm sorry for
the intrusion.

836
01:04:09,479 --> 01:04:10,753
I thank you for your help.

837
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:20,390
Hey, brogan.

838
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:21,595
Hey.

839
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:22,967
If you're here to check

840
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,994
on that search you initiated,
it didn't turn up anything,

841
01:04:25,028 --> 01:04:27,439
but I'd broaden the parameters
if I had more to go on.

842
01:04:27,464 --> 01:04:30,502
Ah, forget that now. I need
this dusted for prints.

843
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,911
Does this have anything to
do with Nicholas logue?

844
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:34,210
It might.

845
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:37,549
This thing's not even bagged.

846
01:04:37,574 --> 01:04:38,609
Yeah, I know.

847
01:04:38,642 --> 01:04:40,986
Paper's way too porous.

848
01:04:41,011 --> 01:04:42,615
Maybe I can pull something
from the cover.

849
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:44,818
Well, just give it a try, okay?

850
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:45,849
Okay.

851
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,691
Got a computer I can
use in here, or...

852
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,321
Yeah, over there.

853
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:25,215
Put your hands where
I can see 'em now.

854
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:28,412
Hey!

855
01:07:31,314 --> 01:07:32,315
You listening to me?

856
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:27,772
Hi.

857
01:09:27,797 --> 01:09:30,208
- Is your mother home?
- Who are you?

858
01:09:30,233 --> 01:09:32,543
Detective Callahan.

859
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:37,116
Mom. A cop is here.

860
01:09:39,042 --> 01:09:40,350
Come in.

861
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:55,862
Hello, Mrs. logue.

862
01:09:58,728 --> 01:10:00,332
I'm detective David Callahan.

863
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,306
I'm very sorry for your loss.

864
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:08,146
I didn't want to be
here to disturb you.

865
01:10:08,171 --> 01:10:10,481
Your husband's car was
involved in an accident.

866
01:10:10,507 --> 01:10:13,485
I was wondering if you know
if he loaned it to someone.

867
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:21,155
You look younger in person.

868
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:24,790
I'm sorry?

869
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:29,064
Come with me.

870
01:10:57,654 --> 01:11:01,295
We were fine until he
became obsessed with you.

871
01:11:41,698 --> 01:11:43,473
How's the family?

872
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,476
My wife would be happier

873
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:47,344
if I got out of the 77th.

874
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:49,646
I can make a few calls.

875
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:51,811
Well, isn't that why I'm here?

876
01:11:54,444 --> 01:11:57,755
I heard an unpleasant rumor
about one of my men.

877
01:11:57,781 --> 01:11:59,257
I need someone
outside the division

878
01:11:59,282 --> 01:12:00,692
to get confirmation for me.

879
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:02,025
This off the books?

880
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:04,827
It is until I can figure out
the extent of the situation.

881
01:12:08,224 --> 01:12:10,431
So this is my shot, verona?

882
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:11,837
Could be.

883
01:12:36,453 --> 01:12:39,229
Sorry about that, officer.
I just got the car.

884
01:12:39,255 --> 01:12:40,461
I ain't used to the power.

885
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:41,900
You wouldn't happen
to have any drugs

886
01:12:41,925 --> 01:12:43,401
or alcohol in here
now, would you?

887
01:12:43,426 --> 01:12:45,599
- No, sir, officer.
- No?

888
01:12:47,263 --> 01:12:49,072
We just want to
go home, officer.

889
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:52,102
I said step out of the vehicle now.
Get out.

890
01:12:52,135 --> 01:12:54,137
Hey, what are you doing?

891
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:58,883
Hey!

892
01:12:58,908 --> 01:13:00,410
Fuck!

893
01:13:00,443 --> 01:13:02,389
Man, pull off, man. Come on.

894
01:13:05,081 --> 01:13:06,560
Hey!

895
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:25,743
- Verona.
- Hey, they shot him.

896
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:28,179
- They shot him.
- Whoa, whoa, hey.

897
01:13:28,204 --> 01:13:29,979
Take a deep breath
and slow down.

898
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:31,382
What happened?

899
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:34,183
Detective Callahan's been shot.
Somebody fucking shot him.

900
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:36,281
Jesus. Were you able
to get a look at them?

901
01:13:36,312 --> 01:13:37,848
I barely had time to react.

902
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,416
- Where are they?
- They drove off.

903
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:40,858
I couldn't get a
plate or anything.

904
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:42,794
I wasn't expecting them
to shoot him. I...

905
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:46,164
Nick. Nick. Is detective
Callahan dead?

906
01:13:46,189 --> 01:13:48,396
I don't know if he's
going to make it.

907
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,596
He's in pretty bad shape.

908
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:53,805
- Can you contain it?
- Contain what?

909
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:56,401
This department doesn't deserve
to pay for his transgressions,

910
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:59,641
so I'll ask you again.
Can you contain it?

911
01:13:59,669 --> 01:14:01,478
Sure. Yes. Yes, I
can contain it.

912
01:14:01,504 --> 01:14:03,506
Good. Now you do it
as fast as you can

913
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:04,984
and get the hell out of there.

914
01:14:13,516 --> 01:14:16,292
Officer's been shot at the...

915
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:17,795
At the corner of
water and frontage.

916
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,822
Repeat, officer down at the
corner of water and frontage.

917
01:14:19,856 --> 01:14:21,631
Copy that. All units,

918
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:23,364
we have a 10-0-0.

919
01:14:23,393 --> 01:14:27,364
We have a 10-0-0 at the
corner of water and frontage.

920
01:14:49,686 --> 01:14:51,095
Just tell my wife...

921
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:53,157
Just tell her I'm sorry.

922
01:14:53,189 --> 01:14:54,190
I'm sorry.

923
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:57,363
Ah, you can tell her
yourself, okay?

924
01:14:57,393 --> 01:14:58,836
You hear those sirens?

925
01:14:58,861 --> 01:15:00,602
They're coming after
you, okay, buddy?

926
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:03,270
You're going to be fine, okay?

927
01:15:03,299 --> 01:15:05,540
You just hold on, buddy.
Hold on.

928
01:15:21,617 --> 01:15:23,027
Hey, what the fuck is this?

929
01:15:23,052 --> 01:15:24,462
Well, it seems
self-explanatory.

930
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:26,864
It's a party to welcome
detective David Callahan

931
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:29,096
- back to active duty.
- I'm close.

932
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:31,002
I've spent three months
building a rock-solid case.

933
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,303
I'm telling you this piece of shit
belongs in northern correctional,

934
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:34,933
not a reception at the
park Plaza hotel.

935
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:37,735
You have seen this,
haven't you?

936
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,544
Oh, you got to be shitting me.

937
01:15:40,569 --> 01:15:42,173
Now you listen to me.

938
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:45,243
The approval rating for this
department is at a 20-year high,

939
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:47,083
- and there is no way...
- Verona...

940
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:49,784
You, me, anybody is going
to jeopardize that.

941
01:15:49,812 --> 01:15:52,554
Callahan is as bad as
they come, verona.

942
01:15:52,582 --> 01:15:54,755
If glorifying him is
good for the rest of us,

943
01:15:54,784 --> 01:15:55,990
is that such a bad thing?

944
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:57,793
What about royce Walker?

945
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:00,096
He's the worst trafficker
outside of New York City.

946
01:16:00,123 --> 01:16:01,966
What happens if we walk
away from this thing?

947
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:03,800
- He gets a free pass.
- You know what, Nick?

948
01:16:03,826 --> 01:16:05,703
I don't think you
can see this now,

949
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:08,732
but honestly this is the
best solution available.

950
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:10,675
- Okay?
- What about me?

951
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,236
Huh? What about my family?

952
01:16:12,268 --> 01:16:14,270
Suck it up. Be a man.
Be a marine.

953
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:18,513
- Fuck you.
- You fucking come back here.

954
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:20,350
Get your fucking ass here,

955
01:16:20,376 --> 01:16:23,084
and you understand
this simple concept.

956
01:16:23,112 --> 01:16:26,719
Before you start engaging
in stinking thinking,

957
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:28,285
just remember this.

958
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:32,163
If I go down, you will be
the one to break my fall

959
01:16:32,188 --> 01:16:34,668
and then fuck your family.

960
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:37,797
See you at the party.

961
01:16:48,004 --> 01:16:51,042
- Royce Walker.
- I know you?

962
01:16:52,709 --> 01:16:54,450
No, you don't know me,

963
01:16:54,477 --> 01:16:55,979
but I know you.

964
01:16:56,012 --> 01:16:57,252
Take it.

965
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:09,693
There's plenty more
where that came from.

966
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:15,339
What the fuck do you want?

967
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:17,275
How much money you
want to spend?

968
01:17:24,407 --> 01:17:26,409
So what do you think?

969
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:31,451
Scottsdale? I don't even
know where that is.

970
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,788
Nobody else does either.

971
01:17:34,617 --> 01:17:37,097
I can't afford this.

972
01:17:42,458 --> 01:17:44,131
Walker will never let me go.

973
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:48,099
Let me worry about him.

974
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:49,507
All right?

975
01:18:01,377 --> 01:18:02,378
Zhanna.

976
01:18:08,117 --> 01:18:09,755
Zhanna.

977
01:18:09,785 --> 01:18:10,923
Ah, no.

978
01:18:10,953 --> 01:18:12,296
God damn it!

979
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:14,799
No. No.

980
01:18:14,824 --> 01:18:16,497
Baby, no.

981
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:33,381
I owned her just
like I own you.

982
01:18:48,090 --> 01:18:49,694
He's a regular

983
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,636
just like you used to be.

984
01:18:52,795 --> 01:18:56,106
Pull the strings and
watch them dance.

985
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:03,507
He's in my house right now.

986
01:19:13,616 --> 01:19:16,256
Should ask for
lieutenant larussa.

987
01:19:16,285 --> 01:19:18,856
You tell him everything
he needs is downstairs.

988
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:27,972
Lieutenant.

989
01:19:27,997 --> 01:19:29,635
You're not going
to believe this.

990
01:19:29,665 --> 01:19:32,143
Eh, probably not. You can try.

991
01:19:32,168 --> 01:19:34,170
So I couldn't get a
clean print off the gun

992
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:37,377
we found next to logue's body,
but I was able to pull a latent

993
01:19:37,406 --> 01:19:39,579
off of one of the
shells inside the clip.

994
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,349
So now tell me
you got a match.

995
01:19:41,377 --> 01:19:44,051
Better. We've already
got this guy in lockup.

996
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,821
You're right.

997
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:48,556
I don't believe you.

998
01:19:48,584 --> 01:19:50,061
Told you.

999
01:21:09,999 --> 01:21:13,242
I've done a terrible thing.

1000
01:21:13,269 --> 01:21:15,977
There's no going back.

1001
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:23,051
That's why today is
the day that I die.

1002
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:34,899
But I'm going to
make it right...

1003
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,598
So I'm not going alone.

1004
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:57,682
What are you doing?

1005
01:21:57,713 --> 01:21:59,283
Uh...

1006
01:21:59,315 --> 01:22:01,056
I'm sorry.

1007
01:22:02,184 --> 01:22:04,460
I'm so sorry, Alex.

1008
01:22:07,189 --> 01:22:10,167
I never meant to
hurt you or lanie.

1009
01:22:10,192 --> 01:22:12,035
You got to believe me.

1010
01:22:12,061 --> 01:22:14,200
Why are you saying that?

1011
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:19,643
I love you both
with all my heart.

1012
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,247
Whatever happens to me...

1013
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:29,053
You tell her that, okay?

1014
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,881
Okay?

1015
01:22:58,073 --> 01:22:59,450
Hey, brogan.

1016
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:03,218
Callahan, found a couple matches
on that journal you dropped off.

1017
01:23:03,245 --> 01:23:05,689
We had to fume it,
but besides yours,

1018
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:08,354
we found one belonging
to royce Walker.

1019
01:23:13,222 --> 01:23:14,698
I know.

1020
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:16,225
Thanks.

1021
01:23:27,536 --> 01:23:29,538
Who's got your piece, oleg?

1022
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:31,312
I don't own one.

1023
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:34,184
- Oh.
- I do not believe in violence.

1024
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:36,246
I doubt your girlfriend
would agree with that.

1025
01:23:37,580 --> 01:23:39,023
All right, listen to
me very carefully,

1026
01:23:39,048 --> 01:23:40,220
you fucking douche bag.

1027
01:23:40,249 --> 01:23:42,786
A cop was shot last night,
and your gun was involved.

1028
01:23:42,818 --> 01:23:43,888
A cop?

1029
01:23:43,919 --> 01:23:46,957
I guess somewhere a Saint
just got his wings.

1030
01:23:46,989 --> 01:23:49,629
- Oh, whoa, whoa.
- That's all you got?

1031
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:52,569
No, no, no. He's got a
lot more than that.

1032
01:23:52,594 --> 01:23:54,699
So maybe it's time you
stopped cracking wise

1033
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:55,970
and answered the question.

1034
01:23:57,399 --> 01:23:59,470
You don't get it. You get
three hots and a cot

1035
01:23:59,501 --> 01:24:01,276
for doing your old lady.
That's easy time.

1036
01:24:01,303 --> 01:24:02,780
But for killing a cop...

1037
01:24:02,805 --> 01:24:05,376
How the fuck could I kill
a cop while I'm here?

1038
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:06,545
Think about it.

1039
01:24:06,575 --> 01:24:08,919
Oleg, let me teach
you a new word.

1040
01:24:08,944 --> 01:24:10,821
"Conspiracy."

1041
01:24:10,846 --> 01:24:12,120
"Conspiritzia."

1042
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:13,217
That's close enough.

1043
01:24:13,249 --> 01:24:15,626
Doesn't matter if you
pulled the trigger,

1044
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:19,155
just so you knew what the
gun was being used for,

1045
01:24:19,188 --> 01:24:20,997
so let's try again.
Where's your gun?

1046
01:24:21,023 --> 01:24:22,798
Where's your gun?

1047
01:24:22,825 --> 01:24:24,133
Where's your fucking gun?!

1048
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:25,603
Captain.

1049
01:24:25,628 --> 01:24:27,471
I'll take it from here.

1050
01:24:27,496 --> 01:24:29,237
Sure. We'd like to sit in.

1051
01:24:29,265 --> 01:24:30,471
That won't be necessary.

1052
01:24:30,499 --> 01:24:31,500
Go, go.

1053
01:24:32,668 --> 01:24:34,238
Was I unclear, lieutenant?

1054
01:24:38,774 --> 01:24:40,310
Fucking commie.

1055
01:24:46,682 --> 01:24:49,288
You know what a
risk-benefit ratio is?

1056
01:24:49,318 --> 01:24:51,525
Do you know what that means?

1057
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:52,623
It's like a negotiation.

1058
01:24:52,654 --> 01:24:56,261
And do I have the deal
of a lifetime for you.

1059
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:57,531
Good.

1060
01:25:09,271 --> 01:25:11,308
Dispatch, this is
five-Lincoln-12.

1061
01:25:13,042 --> 01:25:15,318
Go ahead, five-Lincoln-12. Over.

1062
01:25:15,344 --> 01:25:17,288
I'm at 1175 fulton.

1063
01:25:17,313 --> 01:25:20,089
Shots fired. Officer down.

1064
01:25:23,252 --> 01:25:24,822
All patrols, respond.

1065
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:27,459
We have a 10-0-0 at 1175 fulton.

1066
01:25:27,489 --> 01:25:28,991
Immediate backup.

1067
01:26:55,777 --> 01:26:57,381
Hey, Walker!

1068
01:27:03,085 --> 01:27:04,792
You had to get rid
of logue, huh?

1069
01:27:06,422 --> 01:27:08,231
Why me?

1070
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:11,032
Why did it have to be me?

1071
01:27:12,928 --> 01:27:15,033
I remember watching you on TV

1072
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:17,339
begging your savior
to come forward

1073
01:27:17,366 --> 01:27:18,936
so you could thank
him in person.

1074
01:27:21,003 --> 01:27:23,380
It was touching.

1075
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:24,645
Then I started to wonder.

1076
01:27:27,376 --> 01:27:29,549
What if that journal had
a different ending?

1077
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:35,621
What would happen if your savior
came back into your life...

1078
01:27:37,019 --> 01:27:38,692
And you had the
chance to repay him?

1079
01:27:45,027 --> 01:27:47,507
How far would you go, Cal?

1080
01:27:48,697 --> 01:27:49,698
Pull the strings.

1081
01:27:49,731 --> 01:27:52,109
Watch them dance.

1082
01:29:05,107 --> 01:29:07,178
Okay. Okay, that's good.

1083
01:29:07,209 --> 01:29:08,688
Take a hike.

1084
01:29:10,045 --> 01:29:11,319
Thank you.

1085
01:29:14,216 --> 01:29:16,025
Maybe I should get
a lawyer present.

1086
01:29:18,754 --> 01:29:22,759
I have a sworn affidavit
here from oleg emelyanenko.

1087
01:29:24,059 --> 01:29:25,402
It states that royce Walker

1088
01:29:25,427 --> 01:29:27,404
found out logue was
an undercover officer

1089
01:29:27,429 --> 01:29:29,373
and ordered a hit on him.

1090
01:29:29,398 --> 01:29:32,208
You discovered this information

1091
01:29:32,234 --> 01:29:34,043
in the course of
your investigation,

1092
01:29:34,069 --> 01:29:35,946
and when you went
to confront Walker,

1093
01:29:35,971 --> 01:29:38,611
he and his men reacted in a
life-threatening manner.

1094
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:41,051
You had no choice

1095
01:29:41,076 --> 01:29:45,081
but to use deadly and
justifiable force.

1096
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:48,621
And the rest just gets
swept under the rug,

1097
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:50,220
right, captain?

1098
01:29:50,252 --> 01:29:51,662
No one cares.

1099
01:29:51,687 --> 01:29:53,325
I care.

1100
01:30:01,697 --> 01:30:03,802
Just sign it

1101
01:30:03,832 --> 01:30:05,175
like you did before.

1102
01:30:07,202 --> 01:30:08,408
Not this time.

1103
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,317
I will never grasp...

1104
01:30:14,943 --> 01:30:17,719
The extent of your ingratitude.

1105
01:30:18,713 --> 01:30:20,249
You know, you talk about

1106
01:30:20,282 --> 01:30:22,694
protecting the integrity
of the department.

1107
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:28,129
The only thing you've ever
concerned yourself with

1108
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:29,931
is covering your own ass.

1109
01:30:34,496 --> 01:30:38,273
Don't you turn your back on me,
you self-righteous little prick.

1110
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:39,540
You keep your mouth shut,

1111
01:30:39,568 --> 01:30:41,878
or I will fucking
bury you, Callahan.

1112
01:30:41,904 --> 01:30:43,110
You hear me?!

1113
01:30:47,309 --> 01:30:49,619
People talk about fate...

1114
01:30:50,979 --> 01:30:53,323
How everything happens
for a reason.

1115
01:30:54,883 --> 01:30:56,590
But I never believed that.

1116
01:30:57,853 --> 01:31:00,390
I disrespected the
woman that I love.

1117
01:31:00,422 --> 01:31:04,367
I violated my oath to
protect and serve.

1118
01:31:04,392 --> 01:31:08,033
I couldn't find a single reason
why I deserve a second chance.

1119
01:31:13,068 --> 01:31:14,479
Until now.

1120
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:37,128
