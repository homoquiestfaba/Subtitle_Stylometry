SIX MONTHS LATER

14
00:02:33,393 --> 00:02:39,316
- Guys, I think we should've stayed at the cabin
- What, stuck? Besides, we need to find out what's happening.

15
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:44,404
- I mean, don't you think they would've found a cure by now?
- Well, they are all dead

16
00:02:46,406 --> 00:02:48,450
Hello!!

17
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:51,536
It was gone man.

18
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,624
Kevin, don't go in there...

19
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:08,845
- Any food?
- Nothing.

20
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:17,729
Vending machine!

21
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:22,943
You're making so much noise.

22
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:38,667
Dude, just break it !

23
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:50,929
Guys...
Guys... Guys!!!

24
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:54,432
Kevin!

25
00:04:21,376 --> 00:04:23,420
Come on! Come on, man!

26
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:30,343
Kevin, come on!

27
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:41,062
Stay back! Let's go this way, Kevin!

28
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:48,445
Come on, get outta here!

29
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,032
Help me! No! Oh God, help me!!!

30
00:05:04,878 --> 00:05:07,755
Ramona, run! Get outta here!

31
00:05:55,094 --> 00:05:56,346
Stay here!

32
00:06:40,556 --> 00:06:42,308
You okay?

33
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,824
Okay. Just hang in there...
He's still alive!

34
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:03,204
- We gotta go, come on.
- Stay away! - No!!

35
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:09,002
- He's gonna change, come on!
- He's gonna be alright! Okay, just hang in there...

36
00:07:15,174 --> 00:07:20,513
- Ramona, come here... 
- Look, I... I'm sorry about your friend, but here, you can't look at this

37
00:07:20,722 --> 00:07:23,808
- What are you guys going to do? He's still alive.

38
00:07:24,684 --> 00:07:26,144
No!

39
00:07:29,605 --> 00:07:32,066
Don't look! Look away!

40
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:26,913
- Hey, I'm Henry.
- Are you two hurt?

41
00:08:29,499 --> 00:08:33,085
- Nah.
- Are you bitten? When the zombies got close to you?

42
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:39,884
- I don't know.
- Do me a favor. Stand up, spread your arms and legs.

43
00:08:40,134 --> 00:08:45,056
- Why? 
- Just a standard procedure. Just... do it, please.
Come on, come on!

44
00:08:48,184 --> 00:08:52,104
Spread your arms, spread your arms.
Just doing a bite check, okay?

45
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:58,653
- You see any bites?
- Not yet...

46
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:08,412
Lift up your pant legs.
Okay. You're clear.

47
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:18,005
Nice to meet you.
Haven't met anybody breathing in quite awhile.

48
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:23,844
- You already meet Henry. This is Julian, Cassie.
- Come on. We gotta get outta here.

49
00:09:24,053 --> 00:09:29,642
- Yeah, we do.
- Our Golden rules: "Forever wandering, lonely as clouds." 

50
00:09:30,226 --> 00:09:32,186
Wordsworth.

51
00:09:33,145 --> 00:09:38,693
- So, where you're coming from?
- Kevin's dad had a cabin. We were just waiting there.

52
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:42,697
Thought we would wait until it's over.
So we came out.

53
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:46,701
I mean, it's over. Sort of...
Just not...not...not in a good way.

54
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:53,207
- You should come with us. Come on.
- No! Billy... We gotta do something.

55
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,296
- It's too dangerous.
- No! I've known him since college.

56
00:09:59,588 --> 00:10:02,925
Sorry for your loss.

57
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:08,472
- Okay? But we need to get out...
- I'm not gonna leave my best friend lying, over there.

58
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:13,686
- or maybe he'd still be alive if you hadn't been wandering around like idiots.
- LIKE IDIOTS??? YOU KILLED MY BEST FRIEND!!!

59
00:10:14,186 --> 00:10:17,273
He's a zombie. He... He's not your boy, he's not Kevin anymore...

60
00:10:21,318 --> 00:10:23,404
I'm sorry, alright?
I didn't... I didn't mean that.

61
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:29,577
- So, what's your friend's name?
- Kevin. Kevin Anderson.

62
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:32,329
- And where's he from?
- Evansville.

63
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:41,172
Come on... We're not safe here.
We stick around, we're gonna turn into zombies too. Come on.

64
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:45,342
You want to end up like Kevin?
We gotta go, come on.

65
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:57,021
- How far to the docks?
- About a day or two.

66
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:36,268
Look.

67
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:44,735
What's the deal with the arrow?

68
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:51,992
- Archers.
- Must be the group ahead of us.

69
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:57,831
- So theory goes
- Start to see them back in Kansas, we've been seeing them ever since.

70
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:03,254
- Kansas, is that where you're from?
- No, we just passed through. We're from back east.

71
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:07,007
- On our way to Catalina.
- The island?

72
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:10,678
Yeah, the army cleared it.
It's a survivor refuge now.

73
00:12:10,886 --> 00:12:13,430
- Yeah, well, we think.
- We know.

74
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:18,686
Okay, well look. We don't really know what's going on.
We had this radio, and it died.

75
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:21,272
And we couldn't get Kevin's truck started.

76
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:27,695
Must be the EMPs.
It took out all electronics, cars, plane, trains, everything.

77
00:12:28,153 --> 00:12:32,449
- It was supposed to contain the plague here.
- Yeah, well that didn't work out so well.

78
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:35,786
Oh man...

79
00:12:40,207 --> 00:12:44,378
Cities keep on burning.
And there's nothing to stop it.

80
00:12:46,672 --> 00:12:48,632
You'll get used to it.

81
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:56,974
Oh wow, look. It's a dog.
Haven't seen a dog in months.


82
00:12:57,266 --> 00:13:02,104
Come here doggie!
Doggie!

83
00:13:03,188 --> 00:13:07,651
- Leave it. We can't take a dog with us.
- Sure we can.

84
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:13,574
- We can train it... not to bark at the zombies.
- Julian. You know we can't. Let's go.

85
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,875
Damn dog.

86
00:13:39,058 --> 00:13:44,938
Gotta make a stop.
Come on, you're coming with me. You're my buddy.

87
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:49,860
- Buddy?
- Pee-buddy.

88
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:09,880
Look, I'm... I'm sorry about before.
It's just that...

89
00:14:10,464 --> 00:14:13,550
if we'd got there sooner, I might've been able to save him.

90
00:14:14,093 --> 00:14:19,223
- You know, it wasn't your fault.
- Well it... happened really quickly.

91
00:14:22,935 --> 00:14:27,773
Yeah, I've always says,
That's why we've never go anywhere alone. Ever.

92
00:14:28,273 --> 00:14:33,946
- Not even to pee, right?
- Tryin' to tell me that, those guys have always been...?

93
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,740
Yep.

94
00:14:39,701 --> 00:14:45,415
- That's awkward.
- Better than a zombie catching you with your pants down.

95
00:14:57,469 --> 00:15:03,350
- Erm... I'm a little shy...
- Ouw... Sorry, my bad. No rush.

96
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,246
Listen up guys. We normally go into town. Who used to be people there are now zombies.

97
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:29,251
Okay, we need to get you two some equipments. And the rest will be looking for some socks.
So, here's the drill:

98
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:33,672
We go into town, we do it quickly and quietly.
Follow my lead, okay?

99
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:36,592
Stop if I stop, go if I go.

100
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:40,137
Be quiet, most importantly, be very aware.

101
00:15:45,601 --> 00:15:49,313
Look who it is. Check it out.

102
00:15:50,397 --> 00:15:54,318
The truth I do not stretch or shove,
when I state that the dog is full of love.

103
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:59,531
- Wordsworth?
- No, actually, it's Ogden Nash.
- Wait, are you encouraging this?

104
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:04,953
No. Look, I drop the granola bar back awhile ago.
He looked... he looked hungry. 

105
00:16:05,203 --> 00:16:10,584
Stop it, Julian. It's gonna bark at the first zombie it see and get us all killed. Just get these equipments, move out.

106
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:20,802
Stay alert, stay quiet and stay on your feet.

107
00:16:21,053 --> 00:16:24,348
You go down, you're not going back up. Not as a human anyway.

108
00:16:25,223 --> 00:16:28,518
- Yeah, well those other ones were easy.
- Yeah, well they were old and slow.

109
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:31,646
- the fresh one are a lot faster.
- See a runner, scream out.

110
00:16:31,897 --> 00:16:34,983
- What's a runner?
- Top of the zombie food chain. Very fast.

111
00:16:35,233 --> 00:16:36,943
Very dangerous.

112
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:06,890
- It's a shambler. Looks like a onesy.
- Why don't you just kill it?

113
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:11,269
Best avoid the slow ones.
Kill them will make a noise and noise attract more undead.

114
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:18,568
Come on, come on!

115
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:36,920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Wait a minute.
Right there. Perfect.

116
00:17:37,796 --> 00:17:42,342
- I don't know, looks like a lot of hiding places.
- We'll be quick, quiet.

117
00:17:43,009 --> 00:17:45,679
It's us. Silent and deadly.

118
00:17:46,763 --> 00:17:50,767
- Looks clear.
- Alright. Let's go.

119
00:18:22,007 --> 00:18:25,927
- What are they doing?
- Smelling for zombies.

120
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:36,354
Any humans here?

121
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:43,486
- Hello?
- Quiet!

122
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:58,376
Okay, usual teams.
New guys come with us.

123
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:07,844
- Shouldn't we look for food?
- Why? We got all food in the world, literally.

124
00:19:08,303 --> 00:19:13,433
We need some sturdy boots for you, something to cover your arms and legs.

125
00:19:13,725 --> 00:19:19,105
- Look for something made out of hard plastic.
- And nothing softer. Zombies can chew right through that.

126
00:19:19,773 --> 00:19:24,319
Make sure it's kinda light. Heavier means more sweat.

127
00:19:27,072 --> 00:19:30,992
- Sorry, that was me.
- Got it!

128
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:35,580
Hey, why don't we take bikes?
It's easier than walking, right?

129
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,125
- Nah, that will make you a target for the runners.
- Yeah, makes it difficult to grab your weapons... 

130
00:19:39,334 --> 00:19:43,671
can't really hear them coming. Been there before, not doing that again.

131
00:19:45,632 --> 00:19:49,135
Look at this. Just because it's the end of the world, doesn't mean people can't clean up.

132
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:53,723
Maybe whoever it was, started, I don't know. Everyone else was dead?

133
00:20:06,069 --> 00:20:09,114
- What are you doing? Isn't that a waste of time?
- Depends on how you spend your time.

134
00:20:09,406 --> 00:20:12,909
- Hey, do you see a woman size 7?
- Definitely not organizing shoes.

135
00:20:18,748 --> 00:20:23,128
- Alright, I'm gonna look at the back to get some...
- Hold on, hold on. We'll go with you.

136
00:20:23,795 --> 00:20:29,384
yeah, yeah, yeah. You, you gotta be careful.
You don't know what kind of putrid and damn mess you will find back there.

137
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:31,678
The zombies can't even figure out doors.

138
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:40,395
- Hey, remember that one guy? What was his name? 
- Kirkman?
- Kirkman, yeah, yeah. This guy who was with us in this coffee shop once.

139
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:45,859
so, he was looking for this Star Grow or whatever, right?
And he opens the back door, like 50 zombies waiting.

140
00:20:49,863 --> 00:20:55,410
- Ready?
- So what happened to this Kirkman guy?
- Just what you expect?

141
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:04,002
- So, what are we looking for again?
- Size 7, like a combat boot.

142
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,964
- Combat boot?
- Or something like that.
- You might be a natural in this.

143
00:21:12,552 --> 00:21:17,348
- Those are 7
- Perfect!

144
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,949
We got company!!

145
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:44,626
We're going from the back!
Let's go!

146
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:21,120
- We should use blare.
- Okay, do it.

147
00:22:23,456 --> 00:22:28,002
- Hurry up Julian!
- What's the hold up?

148
00:22:30,588 --> 00:22:32,215
Hurry up now, it's getting ugly!

149
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:49,315
- That was the last one.
- Why are they leaving?

150
00:22:50,358 --> 00:22:55,321
They are attracted to the sound.
Let's get going, that won't distract them for long.

151
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:06,791
This is crazy. We lost Kevin, now he's trying to kill us!

152
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:11,254
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay. We can go back to Kevin. We can take food, I promise you...

153
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:15,341
- Ramona, we would never make it there.
- How do we know it's all like this in Catalina?

154
00:23:15,591 --> 00:23:17,885
My husband told me, alright?

155
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:24,934
Guys, let's talk about it later.
Just find a place that's safe.

156
00:23:25,393 --> 00:23:26,978
- Let's go
- Come on.

157
00:24:16,068 --> 00:24:18,529
- More record-keeping?
- Yep.

158
00:24:21,073 --> 00:24:26,871
- Who do you think is gonna read that?
- Well, on a good day, I think it will be my kids...

159
00:24:27,121 --> 00:24:29,582
which I currently have none by the way.

160
00:24:32,335 --> 00:24:36,881
- and on a bad day?
- figure it would be the guy who finds my body.

161
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,763
- it's awful.
- well, at least, you know, there's somebody left to find my body, right?

162
00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:49,810
We're about 60 miles away from high school. We get up early, should be able to be there by nightfall.

163
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:55,024
- Highschool?
- Yeah, it's a survivor stronghold right outside of L.A. That's our next stop.

164
00:24:55,274 --> 00:25:00,279
- How do you know it's still there?
- Man, you like to ask a lot of questions, don't you?

165
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:05,242
- Excuse me if I don't know everything, but I do want to...
- We ran into a group, was headed east.

166
00:25:05,493 --> 00:25:08,996
- Said they stayed there, that there was quite the operation.
- East?

167
00:25:09,455 --> 00:25:13,793
They heard it's a safe zone in South Dakota.
They didn't think Catalina existed.

168
00:25:15,294 --> 00:25:20,883
- Found it.
- What? A civilization.

169
00:25:21,342 --> 00:25:22,885
What is it?

170
00:25:25,513 --> 00:25:27,598
Family dinner

171
00:25:37,066 --> 00:25:41,612
Michigan in the summer. I mean, can you imagine?
I don't wanna go into detail, but the smell?

172
00:25:41,862 --> 00:25:46,409
- And that's the end of that story.
- Yeah, I just ate.

173
00:25:48,744 --> 00:25:51,622
So, weren't you saying you have a husband?

174
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,261
Yeah, Stew. Stewie.

175
00:26:07,096 --> 00:26:12,476
Officially, acting sergeant general Stewart Anderson.
At least, that is two weeks into the crisis.

176
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:17,064
They were, uh, running low on doctors and he volunteered.

177
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,903
He ran with the government and I stayed to get my brother, Jake.

178
00:26:23,571 --> 00:26:27,074
We were going to get the next flight out to Catalina.

179
00:26:34,623 --> 00:26:38,544
- What happened?
- Let's talk about this another time.

180
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:44,592
There was no other flight. So I found Jake,

181
00:26:44,842 --> 00:26:46,886
and headed West.

182
00:26:47,553 --> 00:26:49,805
Then I met with Julian a day later.

183
00:26:50,681 --> 00:26:54,393
Yeah, I was stuck behind a soda machine in S-Mart... 

184
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:57,521
- can you imagine that?
- Yeah, I can imagine.

185
00:27:00,483 --> 00:27:06,238
- Mack, I got him all outside of Pittsburgh.
- I don't know how much saving I did.
- I do

186
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,328
- met the big guy in Ohio.
- surrounded by, I kid you not, over a hundred zombies.

187
00:27:12,578 --> 00:27:15,247
- and he's even looking for more.
- You killed my horse.

188
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:20,669
- I was pissed off. Now you can mess with me, but not my horse.
- We'll buy you some new horse someday.

189
00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:28,177
Alright, enough melancholy. It's time for dessert.

190
00:27:28,844 --> 00:27:32,348
I saved the best for the last.

191
00:27:33,557 --> 00:27:36,018
- Smores!
- Oh, yeah!

192
00:28:03,545 --> 00:28:04,964
- Hi
- Hi

193
00:28:06,173 --> 00:28:09,051
- That was actually kind of fun.
- It helps.

194
00:28:13,263 --> 00:28:16,558
So, how come nobody would say what happened to Cassie's brother?

195
00:28:18,894 --> 00:28:23,857
It actually happened before I met him.
They were out looking for supplies and they ran into a pack.

196
00:28:24,358 --> 00:28:29,321
- Well, what do you mean? What's a pack?
- Well, it doesn't happen very often, 

197
00:28:29,863 --> 00:28:34,576
but sometimes the zombies will get together and they form a pack.
It's kinda like a... herd of cattle.


198
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,914
Kinda following each others lead.
For whatever reason...

199
00:28:39,873 --> 00:28:43,961
- they keyed in on Jake.
- Did they kill him right in front of her?

200
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:49,007
I hope so, but being honest...

201
00:28:50,718 --> 00:28:54,304
Cass thinks that, she saw it moving as it pulled him away.

202
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,392
She thinks he turned.

203
00:29:00,728 --> 00:29:06,191
I mean, I mean it has to be so terrible just to think that he's out there and he's one of them.

204
00:29:07,735 --> 00:29:11,280
Yeah, that's what it takes.

205
00:29:15,117 --> 00:29:17,161
What about you? Have you left anyone?

206
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:24,251
Not after the plague, no.

207
00:29:29,298 --> 00:29:31,258
But, uh, couple years before, I lost my wife.

208
00:29:35,137 --> 00:29:39,266
- Cancer
- I'm so sorry.

209
00:29:46,607 --> 00:29:48,233
It's her.

210
00:29:53,989 --> 00:29:57,284
Wow, she's very pretty.
She looks like a wonderful person.

211
00:29:59,328 --> 00:30:01,413
She was.

212
00:30:03,832 --> 00:30:09,129
She made me a promise when she died, that,
I would go on living for both of us.

213
00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:14,843
So... That's what I do.

214
00:30:28,232 --> 00:30:31,568
Don't worry.
We'll get to Catalina.

215
00:30:36,907 --> 00:30:38,533
What is that?

216
00:30:44,748 --> 00:30:49,795
It's not a zombie. It's Julian's dog.

217
00:30:51,129 --> 00:30:53,173
Get outta here. Get outta here!

218
00:30:56,969 --> 00:30:59,346
Guys! Guys!
Get outta here, now!

219
00:31:22,703 --> 00:31:26,540
- What did you do that for?
- Stay back, Julian! The dog's turned.

220
00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:34,172
I didn't know dogs could get the plague.

221
00:31:36,133 --> 00:31:37,884
Neither do we.

222
00:31:51,481 --> 00:31:53,567
What about using flamethrowers?

223
00:31:54,151 --> 00:31:58,071
Okay. So you find a zombie and you hit it with flamethrower.
Now what?

224
00:31:58,697 --> 00:32:02,534
- Now it's dead.
- Now you're being attacked by flaming zombie.

225
00:32:03,618 --> 00:32:07,372
- Burner is what we called it.
- Oh yeah, but eventually...

226
00:32:07,664 --> 00:32:11,001
Severe head trauma remove the needs for eventually.

227
00:32:13,795 --> 00:32:18,216
- What do we make of that?
- Sniper was there.

228
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:24,723
- Let's check it out.
- Right behind you.

229
00:32:42,115 --> 00:32:43,533
There any humans in here?

230
00:33:09,142 --> 00:33:13,855
- 30 hot shells.
- More zombies like our friend over here.

231
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,151
Let's get outta here.

232
00:33:38,505 --> 00:33:40,799
HUMAN SAFE ZONE

233
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:47,305
There's a onesy looking passage by date.

234
00:33:49,933 --> 00:33:52,852
Leave it alone, stay under the radar.

235
00:34:17,377 --> 00:34:19,754
Ready? Let's go.

236
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,519
That zombie shots...

237
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:46,197
- So, where's everyone?
- If we're lucky, barricaded inside.

238
00:34:47,115 --> 00:34:49,117
What if we're unlucky?

239
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:11,639
- Smells really bad in here...
- Yeah... It was zombies.

240
00:35:13,975 --> 00:35:15,894
Any humans in here?

241
00:35:21,941 --> 00:35:25,820
- Dunno guys, doesn't feel so good here.
- If anyone was here, we would've seen them by now.

242
00:35:26,488 --> 00:35:32,035
- Let's just go this way.
- I want to go back to Kevin's cabin, come on...

243
00:35:32,494 --> 00:35:34,621
- Hello!!
- Just calm down!

244
00:35:42,212 --> 00:35:45,423
- I think we should get outta here.
- They're here.

245
00:35:46,508 --> 00:35:49,302
- You sure?
- Yeah, they're here.

246
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:53,139
Ssttt...

247
00:35:57,936 --> 00:36:01,272
The last safe house, before Catalina.
They're here.

248
00:36:09,614 --> 00:36:11,741
I dunno, doesn't look so good down there either.

249
00:36:13,618 --> 00:36:18,373
- There's the back door.
- We should go man.

250
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,308
They've been in here?

251
00:36:39,435 --> 00:36:41,563
I know, who would've want to give up ball this luxury?

252
00:36:42,355 --> 00:36:45,149
Look around for any papers, notes, signs. Anything.

253
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:11,884
Ambush!

254
00:37:15,346 --> 00:37:16,806
They're coming!

255
00:37:20,476 --> 00:37:21,728
To the doors!

256
00:38:03,978 --> 00:38:06,355
Billy!
Guys, help Billy!

257
00:38:40,223 --> 00:38:41,682
Billy! Get back!

258
00:39:24,934 --> 00:39:28,771
Ramona!
Henry! Help me!

259
00:39:39,156 --> 00:39:40,408
Back, back!

260
00:39:44,662 --> 00:39:49,208
- Billy! - Billy!
- Henry! Help me!

261
00:39:53,629 --> 00:39:56,257
Help me!
Help... Help me!!!

262
00:39:57,174 --> 00:40:00,052
- Shut the door!
- Come on!

263
00:40:13,274 --> 00:40:15,318
There was a zombie, so I called it.

264
00:40:20,031 --> 00:40:21,407
Ramona, I'm sorry.

265
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:28,539
What? Wha... Where's Billy?

266
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:34,462
I'm sorry, we... we got separated.

267
00:40:35,254 --> 00:40:38,132
What do you mean you got separated?
There is four of you!

268
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:44,430
- We should've gone back.
- OF course you should've gone back! You just left him?

269
00:40:45,014 --> 00:40:47,099
We've tried Mack, we did. Okay? We did, we tried.

270
00:40:49,852 --> 00:40:52,605
Listen, it could've been much worse, alright?
They are waiting for us inside.

271
00:40:53,105 --> 00:40:58,235
- There's no way... There's no way they're waiting
- Yes, I'm telling you, alright? They're hiding. It was an ambush.

272
00:40:58,361 --> 00:41:00,988
- Waiting for any of us to get out.
- Zombies don't hide, Julian!

273
00:41:00,988 --> 00:41:02,823
Who cares if they were hiding?

274
00:41:14,126 --> 00:41:17,338
Yes, she's right.
We just gotta get outta here.

275
00:41:40,778 --> 00:41:46,534
Let's catch our breath.
I mean, how can a man of your stature not be wheezing?

276
00:41:50,454 --> 00:41:52,498
I don't talk as much as you do.

277
00:41:57,628 --> 00:42:01,841
- You alright?
- I'm kinda numb.

278
00:42:08,013 --> 00:42:09,723
- Dammit!
- What?

279
00:42:11,684 --> 00:42:16,480
- God, I lost my brush!
- We'll get you another brush.

280
00:42:16,605 --> 00:42:20,317
No, Mack, I don't want another brush.
I want my things!

281
00:42:20,985 --> 00:42:22,820
- When we get to Catalina...
- What if we don't??

282
00:42:23,028 --> 00:42:25,781
What if they... What if they're all dead?
What if there's no one there?

283
00:42:26,282 --> 00:42:29,410
Okay? This is... This is crazy man.

284
00:42:30,744 --> 00:42:33,789
We're all going to die getting to Catalina.

285
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:41,422
- I don't plan on dyin'
- No one ever does, Julian!

286
00:42:43,007 --> 00:42:46,927
- You're just tired...
- Yeah, you're right.

287
00:42:48,429 --> 00:42:50,431
I'm tired of all this.

288
00:42:58,898 --> 00:43:03,277
- What's the matter?
- I'm just tired, Henry...

289
00:43:05,404 --> 00:43:07,364
It's going to be okay.

290
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:17,124
Do you wanna know why I want to go to Catalina?
One: no zombies.

291
00:43:18,125 --> 00:43:20,919
Two: no zombies.

292
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:28,886
Three, I wanna, I want to take a shower.
I want a toilet that flushes. I want water...

293
00:43:29,011 --> 00:43:33,974
hot water that comes out of a tap, that you don't put on a pot, boil over a fire. I want the hot water,  

294
00:43:34,224 --> 00:43:38,896
the... take a bath. That's right, I wanna take a shower.

295
00:43:39,229 --> 00:43:42,316
together with... the girl.

296
00:43:46,779 --> 00:43:51,909
I don't want too much, just a small house...
a garden.

297
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,162
grow tomatoes.

298
00:43:56,038 --> 00:44:01,251
- I would like to do that again
- Me? I miss my horse.

299
00:44:04,213 --> 00:44:07,591
- Damn, that's gotta be a big horse.
- Yeah...

300
00:44:11,762 --> 00:44:13,430
Let's go to any place but here.

301
00:44:17,393 --> 00:44:19,853
I don't want to die like Billy and Kevin...

302
00:44:22,898 --> 00:44:25,859
Julian, get the map. We're moving out.

303
00:44:37,996 --> 00:44:41,291
- Looks like we're staying west of there.
- We can cut pass these houses.

304
00:44:42,501 --> 00:44:48,382
- Pick it up on the other side?
- Yeah... It's gonna get dark in a few hours. 

305
00:44:49,591 --> 00:44:53,095
We should move out. Get as far away from here as we can.

306
00:45:04,189 --> 00:45:05,607
Look at that...

307
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,739
Things could get a lot worse for us.

308
00:45:26,378 --> 00:45:28,088
How far do we have to go?

309
00:45:36,471 --> 00:45:38,640
I dunno, maybe we're going the wrong way.

310
00:45:38,891 --> 00:45:42,352
- you're kidding. We're going the right way.
- hey, do you guys see that smoke up ahead? 

311
00:45:42,561 --> 00:45:46,315
- Look.
- Looks like that house might be on fire.

312
00:45:46,815 --> 00:45:49,192
- I see something moving up ahead
- Me too.

313
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:53,113
- What you make of it?
- I dunno, it looks like human.

314
00:45:53,697 --> 00:45:57,075
Maybe it's the archers.
What do you say, should we help him?

315
00:45:57,826 --> 00:46:01,330
Let's go! Hello!

316
00:46:03,457 --> 00:46:05,626
- Hello!
- Julian, not so fast!

317
00:47:25,539 --> 00:47:31,128
- Let's go.
- We lost a few of ours!
- You'll lose more if you don't come now.

318
00:47:31,378 --> 00:47:36,258
- They're flanking us!
- Cassie! Henry!
- Shut up! You're drawing them to us!

319
00:47:36,466 --> 00:47:38,343
Last chance. We're leaving.

320
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,832
- Where are the others?
- Don't know.

321
00:48:09,291 --> 00:48:11,835
- How many more do you think?
- Don't know.

322
00:48:13,295 --> 00:48:14,921
Thanks for coming back for me.

323
00:48:39,863 --> 00:48:43,491
- He's coming! - Keep him busy!
- What? - Distract him.

324
00:48:46,203 --> 00:48:47,370
Over here! Over here!

325
00:49:05,555 --> 00:49:06,973
Henry, watch out!

326
00:49:20,362 --> 00:49:23,573
I wish I would've find this earlier.
Damn you ugly.


327
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,787
Let's go.

328
00:49:52,644 --> 00:49:55,105
- Where are we going?
- We have a safe house set up.

329
00:49:55,689 --> 00:49:59,359
- There's no creepers following us
- We left Banks behind to distract them

330
00:49:59,776 --> 00:50:02,320
You left one man behind to distract a hundred zombies?

331
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:05,740
One girl. Don't worry, she knows what she's doing.

332
00:50:06,032 --> 00:50:08,326
- How many of you are there?
- Just the three of us.

333
00:50:09,577 --> 00:50:12,664
Okay. We're not too far away now.
Now watch for trip wires.

334
00:50:12,997 --> 00:50:16,292
- They are marked by ribbon.
- Don't you think the ribbon will give it away?

335
00:50:16,626 --> 00:50:18,753
No. Zombies don't know what ribbons are.

336
00:50:19,963 --> 00:50:22,882
Look, we appreciate the help, but we have to find our friends.

337
00:50:23,925 --> 00:50:28,346
- You honestly think they made it?
- We've fought our way across 2,000 miles, so yeah.

338
00:50:28,555 --> 00:50:31,599
- Pretty sure they made it.
- You've made it that far?

339
00:50:31,808 --> 00:50:35,311
- Hi. I'm Myrah.
- Julian.
- Hi Julian

340
00:50:38,606 --> 00:50:42,277
- They wanna go back. They have two other people.
- You won't make it.

341
00:50:42,485 --> 00:50:44,737
There's more of them than we thought.
We have to go.

342
00:50:46,156 --> 00:50:50,326
- Alright, we're close.
- Listen, if you want to go after them, I got your back.

343
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:52,495
It honestly says a lot.

344
00:50:55,582 --> 00:50:59,252
Okay. Damn it Cas, where are you?

345
00:51:40,418 --> 00:51:43,838
We were headed through the city with ferry when we had a massive pack of the dead.

346
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:46,716
- Hey, we just comb zombies.
- What ferry?

347
00:51:46,925 --> 00:51:49,302
Catalina sends a ferry every few weeks to pick up survivors

348
00:51:50,011 --> 00:51:52,388
- At least that's what we heard.
- We heard about it back east.

349
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:57,560
- Took us a while to get here though.
- Thats the same with us, what was it? Six months?

350
00:51:57,769 --> 00:52:00,605
We've been looking for a way around the undead for two days, but the city is full of them.

351
00:52:00,813 --> 00:52:04,359
- Yeah, as a rule, we don't go to cities.
- Good rule. We came out of Chicago,

352
00:52:04,609 --> 00:52:07,946
started with 20 survivors. Cops and firefighters, well armed.

353
00:52:08,154 --> 00:52:10,198
We're the only ones that made it.

354
00:52:10,406 --> 00:52:13,910
- Must've been difficult.
- Oh, they would still be alive if they listen to us.

355
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:18,665
Now look. The east route, it's filled with the dead, I'm ruling that out.

356
00:52:19,374 --> 00:52:25,213
We all know what the suburbs look like.
Now we could come around down here to avoid the section and come out through the South.

357
00:52:25,421 --> 00:52:29,884
- That'll take us two or three days at least.
- Correct. Now we don't know what we're going to find there.

358
00:52:30,093 --> 00:52:34,722
- What about this north-west road here?
- Ah, I'm getting to that. Now we scouted this when we first got here.

359
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:38,726
And there's a lot of dead but compared to other options, it's probably our best.

360
00:52:38,935 --> 00:52:41,980
We need to move quickly, no guns. Kill only the deads that are a threat.

361
00:52:46,442 --> 00:52:49,654
Now look, I don't know if your teams are up to it.
But it might've been better, if you stay here,

362
00:52:49,862 --> 00:52:55,410
- and let us bring back help.
- I don't have a team. I have friends. And they're up to it.

363
00:52:55,618 --> 00:52:57,787
We just have to go back for Henry and Cass.

364
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,123
That kind of thinkings are gonna get you killed.

365
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:05,378
We saw how you handles yourself back there, and we all think you're up to it.

366
00:53:05,962 --> 00:53:08,715
I have to think about my team, we're not dying for anyone else.

367
00:53:10,008 --> 00:53:13,302
Alright, I'll make the decision for you.
If Henry and Cass are alive,

368
00:53:13,511 --> 00:53:16,139
we're gonna take this route to get there. We'll go with you that far.

369
00:53:16,472 --> 00:53:19,934
- After that? You're on your own.
- Thanks for the favor.

370
00:53:21,811 --> 00:53:26,858
Alright, fine.
That area is my biggest concern, okay?

371
00:53:29,193 --> 00:53:32,155
- There's a lot of dead.
- Can't... can't you just call them zombies?

372
00:53:32,363 --> 00:53:36,409
- Yeah, really...
- The streets are narrow and they're gonna be hard to avoid.

373
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:39,746
So you do what we tell you, or do not come along, you understand?

374
00:53:39,996 --> 00:53:44,917
- We'll help you through.
- Alright. This is gonna be a big day.

375
00:53:45,626 --> 00:53:48,713
Let's turn in and get some rest.
My team will keep watch.

376
00:53:50,256 --> 00:53:52,550
- I.. I just have a question
- Yeah?

377
00:53:52,842 --> 00:53:55,219
- So we've been finding your arrows for weeks now.
- And?

378
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:58,514
- Why bows?
- Bows are a great weapon. They are silent.

379
00:53:58,723 --> 00:54:02,059
Everybody that raids a sport or good store goes for the bullets, nobody even touches the arrows. 

380
00:54:02,268 --> 00:54:04,520
Because most people don't know how to shoot bows.

381
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:08,691
- We're part of the Quincy archery team. That's coach Sinclair.
- Ah... Alright.

382
00:54:09,734 --> 00:54:12,778
Sweet dreams. 

383
00:54:37,512 --> 00:54:41,933
- You uh, you want me to take over while you get some sleep?
- We have a system going, 

384
00:54:42,183 --> 00:54:44,268
doesn't work well when we tried to include outsiders.

385
00:54:44,477 --> 00:54:47,313
Yeah, you won't need it after tomorrow. We will be in Catalina.

386
00:54:48,147 --> 00:54:51,234
That's... the plan anyway.

387
00:54:51,442 --> 00:54:55,196
As they say, the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.

388
00:54:57,698 --> 00:55:02,328
It's actually gang aft a-gley.
From... I mean from the original.

389
00:55:02,745 --> 00:55:05,414
Burn's... Burn's poem.

390
00:55:08,626 --> 00:55:11,754
You tryin' to charm me with poetry, during zombie apocalypse?

391
00:55:13,631 --> 00:55:18,344
Is it working?
Coz I wanna know.

392
00:55:32,149 --> 00:55:34,694
I hope that's a satellite, not the space station.

393
00:55:42,952 --> 00:55:44,996
Get some sleep, Julian.
You'll need it.

394
00:55:56,674 --> 00:56:00,428
Hey look. What is that?

395
00:56:01,137 --> 00:56:04,015
Satellite maybe, I don't know.

396
00:56:06,058 --> 00:56:10,896
- Sometimes the end of the world is beautiful.
- Look, we gotta find a place to sleep.

397
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,107
It's going to be a busy day tomorrow.

398
00:56:36,464 --> 00:56:40,801
- Alright, Banks will be in the lead, I'm 15 feets back, then Sarah and your team.
- Copy.

399
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:43,137
- Remember the hand signs?
- Uh, maybe

400
00:56:43,345 --> 00:56:46,932
- Look, listen, wait, move up and rally.
- Which is the bad one?

401
00:56:47,141 --> 00:56:49,810
- Rally, means I need help.
- If you're confused, ask Sarah.

402
00:56:50,019 --> 00:56:53,564
We're only eliminating the dead, if they're a threat or they'll see us.

403
00:56:53,773 --> 00:56:57,109
- We ran out of ammo last night.
- Good, or you will be tempted to shoot.

404
00:56:57,234 --> 00:57:00,571
- Your version of good and mine are not the same.
- We're full with arrows.

405
00:57:01,113 --> 00:57:04,408
- If anybody can save and retrieve an arrow, do it.
- We're gonna need 'em.

406
00:57:09,789 --> 00:57:14,835
- You think the others make it out okay?
- Yeah, Mack will keep them save.

407
00:57:17,087 --> 00:57:22,218
- We should go back man...
- Nah, we're gonna go towards the island. That's where they'll be headed.

408
00:57:22,843 --> 00:57:25,888
You know, if we make it to Catalina, there will be other people there.

409
00:57:26,096 --> 00:57:27,515
Well, I hope so.

410
00:57:30,142 --> 00:57:32,645
I mean, my husband.

411
00:57:34,522 --> 00:57:35,773
Yeah...

412
00:57:39,109 --> 00:57:44,990
it's just that, you know, you and I have become... friends.

413
00:57:45,866 --> 00:57:48,702
- and I don't wanna... don't wanna...
- yeah.

414
00:57:49,286 --> 00:57:51,455
You'll be happy to see him, won't you?

415
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:56,961
Yeah, but I don't wanna change any...

416
00:58:07,388 --> 00:58:09,223
Then I'll be happy too.

417
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,911
Ready, Banks? Go!

418
00:59:41,065 --> 00:59:43,859
There are seven of them, all spread out.
Some looking our way.

419
00:59:44,068 --> 00:59:47,279
- We probably do stop and drop?
- What's a stop and drop?

420
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:50,532
Pick off the furthest one.
When it drops, it will attract the rest.

421
00:59:50,741 --> 00:59:54,495
- They go one way, we go the other.
- I bet you I can make it on the first try.

422
01:00:03,128 --> 01:00:04,379
and I win.

423
01:00:06,882 --> 01:00:08,133
Let's go.

424
01:00:24,691 --> 01:00:29,196
Toilets!
Yes! Toilet time...

425
01:00:29,321 --> 01:00:31,073
Julian, what are you doing?

426
01:01:01,562 --> 01:01:03,188
Am I bit?

427
01:01:09,319 --> 01:01:11,863
Got zombies!!
Move, move, move!

428
01:01:32,634 --> 01:01:34,261
Down there! Get to the van!

429
01:01:42,102 --> 01:01:43,645
Everybody in! Everybody in!

430
01:03:06,603 --> 01:03:08,313
Oh, shit...

431
01:03:47,435 --> 01:03:51,940
Gun looks intact. It's good.
Maybe we could find some ammo.

432
01:04:22,137 --> 01:04:23,763
Not much here.

433
01:04:27,267 --> 01:04:31,563
Bingo. I want to take it with us.

434
01:04:33,648 --> 01:04:37,402
- Too heavy.
- Please?

435
01:05:01,217 --> 01:05:02,302
Mack!

436
01:05:06,806 --> 01:05:10,143
- I want you to keep this going.
- What?

437
01:05:12,354 --> 01:05:17,734
- Keep it going for me, promise me.
- Why?

438
01:05:19,402 --> 01:05:21,154
Look...

439
01:05:46,513 --> 01:05:52,227
Write it down.
Julian. Seattle, Washington. Write it down.

440
01:05:53,269 --> 01:05:58,108
- No... No, no.
- Mack! Mack, Mack! What's done, is done.

441
01:05:58,274 --> 01:06:02,028
I'll make a path. Alright?
Let me get outta here.

442
01:06:04,072 --> 01:06:08,451
- Keep quiet!
- Yes, I can distract them.

443
01:06:08,701 --> 01:06:11,663
- It's not a bad idea.
- No, no, no...

444
01:06:11,913 --> 01:06:14,124
Mack... Don't make this harder.

445
01:06:14,415 --> 01:06:19,629
Find Cassie and Henry, get to Catalina and...
and live!

446
01:06:25,343 --> 01:06:27,095
It's alright... It's alright.

447
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:46,030
Julian. Julian!

448
01:06:52,829 --> 01:06:54,998
He's turned... He's turned.

449
01:07:04,215 --> 01:07:07,176
- He's turning - Julian
- Hold him down!

450
01:07:26,404 --> 01:07:28,072
- I can't fight it!
- Move!

451
01:07:35,455 --> 01:07:36,831
Look away.

452
01:07:41,127 --> 01:07:47,592
- Sorry... Sorry...
- Do it! - I'm sorry.

453
01:08:31,094 --> 01:08:33,304
Ramona... Give me his machete.

454
01:08:57,995 --> 01:08:58,913
Henry, behind you!

455
01:09:13,219 --> 01:09:14,887
They're getting smarter.

456
01:09:21,144 --> 01:09:22,186
Come on!

457
01:10:21,078 --> 01:10:24,123
- They're leaving.
- Okay, let's move out.

458
01:10:41,307 --> 01:10:42,808
Mack, come on!

459
01:11:20,721 --> 01:11:21,764
Up there!

460
01:12:04,348 --> 01:12:09,103
Man, this is getting worse and worse.
Think we're trapped, Henry.

461
01:12:19,447 --> 01:12:22,283
- What's that?
- I think it's Mack

462
01:12:31,208 --> 01:12:35,921
- Well, maybe we can work our way over to that roof
- I don't think so big guy.

463
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:39,842
Got a plan. Come on.

464
01:13:39,068 --> 01:13:41,153
Cassie! This way!

465
01:14:16,730 --> 01:14:18,899
To the boat! It's up ahead!

466
01:14:35,582 --> 01:14:38,252
The gate! Get in!

467
01:14:43,465 --> 01:14:45,551
Come on, come on! They are coming!

468
01:14:47,302 --> 01:14:50,139
- Come on, get in!
- Go go go!

469
01:15:02,109 --> 01:15:03,902
Okay, okay!
It's locked!

470
01:15:34,266 --> 01:15:39,146
- I don't see any gaps.
- Unless the zombies are learning to climb, 

471
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:41,815
think we're going to be okay.

472
01:15:59,958 --> 01:16:05,380
- So you guys are the archer huh?
- Yeah. That's Banks, that's Sarah, I'm Brockton

473
01:16:05,589 --> 01:16:07,382
Hey, I'm cassie, this is Henry.

474
01:16:09,927 --> 01:16:14,848
We've admired your work.
Where's... Where's Julian?

475
01:16:21,146 --> 01:16:22,814
He didn't make it Cass...

476
01:16:48,131 --> 01:16:50,300
I thought Julian would've make it with us...

477
01:16:57,057 --> 01:16:58,141
I'm sorry Cass...

478
01:17:11,822 --> 01:17:12,990
Hey guys!

479
01:17:15,117 --> 01:17:17,577
The ferry arrives noon, on Wednesday.

480
01:17:25,168 --> 01:17:29,798
- What day is it?
- Julian would've known...

481
01:17:39,558 --> 01:17:41,101
I found something.

482
01:17:48,442 --> 01:17:50,110
Lot of instructions.

483
01:17:53,655 --> 01:17:55,407
There's a quarantine procedure.

484
01:17:56,533 --> 01:18:01,329
- All survivors will be segregated on the island for a week
- Make sense.

485
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:17,554
There's food.

486
01:18:20,182 --> 01:18:21,600
Oh my God...

487
01:18:28,899 --> 01:18:30,609
Brockton! Here!

488
01:18:41,703 --> 01:18:43,747
My God...

489
01:18:49,044 --> 01:18:59,888
Oh my God...

490
01:19:03,850 --> 01:19:08,897
- Weapons! Banks, guard the rail.
- Zombie must've gotten here somehow.

491
01:19:09,105 --> 01:19:13,443
- Most of them are torn...
- It doesn't make sense...

492
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:16,988
I never seen the dead drag a human away before.

493
01:19:22,494 --> 01:19:23,870
Neither did we.

494
01:19:33,004 --> 01:19:36,007
- Hey, what was that?
- What?

495
01:19:36,925 --> 01:19:37,968
I don't know...

496
01:19:47,394 --> 01:19:51,940
- Something is dragging the bodies through the top of the containers.
- What the hell?

497
01:20:28,893 --> 01:20:30,020
- Watch out!
- Sara!!!

498
01:20:48,997 --> 01:20:50,540
Henry! Help!!!

499
01:21:25,533 --> 01:21:27,160
- You alright?
- Yeah...

500
01:21:32,207 --> 01:21:33,792
Brockton, watch out!

501
01:21:50,767 --> 01:21:56,064
- I'm coming! We'll deal with Brockton!
- Cassie!
- Henry! Need some help here!!!

502
01:22:03,696 --> 01:22:04,948
Here kitty, kitty, kitty...

503
01:22:07,867 --> 01:22:08,868
Here kitty...

504
01:22:15,416 --> 01:22:20,004
- Meow, bitch.
- Henry, watch out!

505
01:22:45,405 --> 01:22:47,282
I'm not through with you, bitch.

506
01:23:14,851 --> 01:23:19,063
- We got that bitch...
- Yeah, we did...

507
01:23:22,150 --> 01:23:23,818
Don't let me turn...

508
01:23:28,364 --> 01:23:30,408
No... 

509
01:24:02,023 --> 01:24:03,274
Good bye, buddy...

510
01:24:33,054 --> 01:24:34,889
Anyone see a ferry?

511
01:24:37,433 --> 01:24:39,268
We're sure it's coming right?

512
01:24:41,395 --> 01:24:44,607
- I hope so...
- It will come.

513
01:24:46,984 --> 01:24:50,363
So Cas, what's gonna be the first thing you do when you get to Catalina?

514
01:24:52,824 --> 01:24:54,367
Kiss my husband.

515
01:25:00,248 --> 01:25:02,083
Find a new sword.

516
