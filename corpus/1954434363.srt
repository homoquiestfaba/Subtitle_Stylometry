00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,789
and makes the registration of
at 01:00.

4
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:59,076
Minus three minutes to launch.

5
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:03,548
OSM, third stage. Lock
S & A, you are authorized to close.

6
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:07,462
SSC, third stage S & A locked.

7
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:14,511
One of the pillars, the fuel tank open.
- Fuel hose is cleaned.

8
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,473
SSC, the number one valve
thermal management out of it.

9
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:27,232
SSC, second valve
thermal management out of it.

10
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,614
NSC report. Space Shuttle
ready to go.

11
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:38,407
Time of about 30 seconds. SSC,
hydraulic external energy on.

12
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:40,576
Up and down 100%.

13
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:45,122
25 seconds. The distance from the check.
Indicate the distance.

14
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,833
Air traffic control, ready to launch.

15
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:52,214
Right. Shot 20 seconds.
Prepare to go.

16
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,265
Weather unchanged,
orbit locked.

17
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:05,274
Output minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

18
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:11,697

19
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:30,878
Congratulations, Palatier. A great performance
Vasglobelta and from yourself.

20
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:35,678
Thank you for Gibbons.

21
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,304
Is everything all right?

22
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:49,489
Ylitämmekö our authority
watching the world like this?

23
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,693
Do we deserve this...
divine power?

24
00:03:55,694 --> 00:04:02,077
Depends on point of view. This is only a supplement
wonders of the world.

25
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:08,289
Examination of the work of art with a magnifying glass does not detract from the elements -

26
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:14,514
but only reveal things. -
, They may not supposed to see.

27
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:20,176
So, after all, it is true.

28
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:26,560
BAXTER  is in orbit. Time
output, 6 minutes, 13 seconds.

29
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:55,046
Jamie, I'm home.

30
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:06,641
That's cool here.

31
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:13,106
I talked to Mike Johnson.

32
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:21,243
We talked about Christmas. I said that
we do not have any Christmas Eve.

33
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:33,961
I thought that Ruby's choir sung
five o'clock Mass -

34
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:39,636
would be nice to go to them.

35
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:47,555
They always invest to Christmas.
Ruby? Dad came home.

36
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,730
Jamie, I guess you did not put
star tree without me?

37
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,358
For...

38
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,450
Ruby, eat your food.
- It's too hot.

39
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:12,126
Blow. - I look forward to
it cools down.

40
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:24,800
What are you doing?
- I eat these out.

41
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:29,352
I do not want to waste food again.
- It's not your bread, Rich.

42
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:34,774
Jamie, it's not anyone's food.
We have already talked about this.

43
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:42,036
My kids are eating, when the table is set.
And I'm covered.

44
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,991
And that's Robbyn place.
- Will Robby back?

45
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,510
I'm sorry.

46
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,342
You're right.

47
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,970
You're cleaned well, girls.

48
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,933
Do not dispose of stars without me.
It's our thing.

49
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:20,032
There we no longer have stars.
But the angel Robbylle.

50
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,242
Well.

51
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:32,753
You are both dear to my angels.

52
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:52,833
See, Abby. There we live.

53
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,461
Sometimes life is much more beautiful,
when you look at it from a distance.

54
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:08,807
Abby, come on. What is a girl?

55
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,443
Why did you sleep with clothes on?

56
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:17,408
I bought you a Father's Day pajama.
I do not think it was so horrible?

57
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,687
Hello, Richard Hadley.

58
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,370
Well, would you say your name clearly
camera?

59
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:14,378
Richard Hadley.
I-R-C-H-A-D-D or H-A-D-L-E-Y.

60
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,765
Well done, Mr. Hadley. Welcome to the
Chris Hapshow program.

61
00:13:18,766 --> 00:13:26,388
Our guest is Mr. Hadley.
More and more people are aware of Baxter.

62
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,642
Tell me more about it?
- BAXTER means -

63
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:36,189
bi-linear, axial thermal
receiver. Monitoring Satellite.

64
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:39,615
It allows the armed forces
detect foreign objects -

65
00:13:39,616 --> 00:13:43,447
spectrometry and thermodynamically the earth's surface.

66
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:47,409
Could you open that?
- Sure.

67
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,247
Spectrometric measurement is a way of
to measure the energy and mass -

68
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,593
termoenergia and, of course, related to
lämpökeskittymiin.

69
00:13:55,594 --> 00:14:00,547
By combining these techniques can be
to detect all of the Earth's surface -

70
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,258
and explore it from space.

71
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:11,259
Thus, terrorist organizations through
used by the world's radar jamming -

72
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:19,232
sites and projects to conceal
will be obsolete technology?

73
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:23,528
Right. - Wow,
quite an accomplishment.

74
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:29,451
We are very proud Vasglobesta.
The biggest thank you is Edgar Palatierin.

75
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:36,333
He was the originator of the project.
-He Was here last week. The intelligent man.

76
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:40,420
Could you tell inclusion
Vasglobe project?

77
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:48,053
I receive information.
Interviews and press releases.

78
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:53,185
I believe that the world must be
the right information puuhistamme.

79
00:14:55,395 --> 00:15:00,941
When this super satellite is now in orbit
...

80
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:04,196
Please explain why Americans
can sleep better.

81
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:10,419
Well, I imagine that it brings people
-

82
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:15,878
a certain sense of certainty
images and details.

83
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:24,804
Evidence for the existence of one. Thus
no longer need to guess.

84
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,350
Do not need to think about whether
a fact or fiction.

85
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:34,852
Right. Thank you, Mr. Hadley.
It would be in it.

86
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,839
Abby, go home.

87
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,126
Where were you?

88
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,389
I waited for you last night, Rich.

89
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:23,602
Where were you?

90
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,727
Reply to Rich.

91
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:36,533
Where have you been last nights?
You have not spoken to me.

92
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,452
You will not even looked at.

93
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,161
What is going on?

94
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,459
I have seen something.

95
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,464
It's crazy.

96
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,809
I do not know what, but -

97
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,814
it is magical.

98
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,635
You saw it, Abby. Or what?

99
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,896
Yes you saw.

100
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,429
Is it something new? - None.

101
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:33,852
First broadcast in an hour.
- Gibbons wanted to be involved.

102
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:39,485
He told me to send the data in it.
I'll be back.

103
00:22:57,001 --> 00:23:00,175
Baxter thermal imaging ready to
7435980 deviation found

104
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:34,333
You have then you have seen them.
I can see it in your eyes.

105
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:39,622
It is a rare and unfortunate sight.

106
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,504
You are a lucky man.

107
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:48,343
You have a lot of questions,
and I have a lot of answers.

108
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:27,507
Sit.

109
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:07,458
Tick any checkboxes are portals.
Niistähän you know.

110
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:11,879
Portals? - Yes, they
Light buoys.

111
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,432
March opens, and send them to the
to the skies as a school of fish.

112
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:22,684
Send  what up? - The souls.

113
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:52,718
Last night, how the portal.

114
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,012
There.

115
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,433
What are they?

116
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,433
What is your name?

117
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:09,443
Rich. - Well, Rich.

118
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:15,651
This means that the dead are among us
. I hate the idea.

119
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:19,113
After his time in purgatory...
- Purgatory?

120
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:23,494
March spits out the insides
as the bad-tasting piece of meat.

121
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,295
But how?

122
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:34,013
If they are picked, they go to heaven
portals.

123
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:42,014
If it is rejected... They catch fire
and ash raining down back to the ground.

124
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:47,230
One was left yesterday.
As you saw.

125
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,822
All these charts and tables...

126
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:00,247
Sieltäkö them you found?

127
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:06,670
Their search takes a lifetime.
I will not change no longer part of all.

128
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,006
That's what happens to you soon.

129
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,170
How do you know all this?

130
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,841
I died once.

131
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:25,689
But I remember everything I saw there.

132
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:34,111
This purgatory and hell 9
circuit, just as Dante predicted.

133
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:44,417
The doctor from my heart started
I have seen all the more clearly.

134
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:50,547
I've atoned for my sins,
but I know what I experienced.

135
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,926
You will look for souls rest of your life.

136
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:03,891
Still see all of them?
Why did not I know?

137
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,393
Cover your eyes.

138
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,360
Can you see me? - I do not.

139
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:23,160
I see thee? - Yes
probably, if you look.

140
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:25,531
Right.

141
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,957
We both have to want to see each other.

142
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:35,041
Dead  appear only for those who really want
to see.

143
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,591
And...

144
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,131
They live deep in your heart.

145
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:46,093
Those who have that gift
see the same as you.

146
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,517
They will see more than just the world.

147
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:53,060
No one has talked about this.
- Are you gonna talk about?

148
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,110
I do not.

149
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,486
Why not?

150
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,830
Well.

151
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:17,377
I'm sorry if I was rude.
You do not even know my name.

152
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:21,214
Lou Demoine.

153
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,597
Very nice to meet you.

154
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:32,521
You have not been drinking your water, Rich.
There seems to be a little sugar...

155
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,317
Hey, only Lou.

156
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,610
Rich!

157
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:19,812
Hey, you called Richard Hadley,
Vasgloben information to the master.

158
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:27,197
I do not return to work before...
I do not know when.

159
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:31,907
If you need assistance, please contact Wayne Peterson
-

160
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:37,881
personal counseling,
ext 891 Thank you and bye.

161
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:11,365
Jamie! Jamie, wake up.

162
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,118
Rich. Were you out again?
- Get up now.

163
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:20,873
Where are you going? What is this? -
I have to leave for a short period of time.

164
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:24,001
Go to awaken Ruby.
- Where are you going?

165
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:27,546
A small trip. - Where to?

166
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:35,012
I might be able to find Robbyn and save him.
I might be crazy -

167
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:39,484
but this explanation would be even more difficult than
not to explain.

168
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:45,449
Is needed confidence. As if
when you fall backward, and someone -

169
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:49,362
will receive you. Confidently
downfall. That's what this is.

170
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:54,114
Rich, what's wrong with you?
- Nothing!

171
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:58,285
There is nothing wrong with me.
I am sure of this.

172
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:03,042
Who said that the dead can return to the
?

173
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:08,754
Dear. I know that this seems like a
crazy, but do not worry. Ruby!

174
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:13,727
Do not bother to wake him up.
- There is nothing to worry about. Ruby!

175
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:20,108
Honey, come back to bed.
- Hey, pumpkin.

176
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,689
Now look what you've done.
- Stop that, Jamie.

177
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:32,570
Listen. You know that I
walked out last night.

178
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:39,285
Abby walks in the canyon,
when I saw the beam of light.

179
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:45,708
She saw it, too. It was a portal,
this vortex up to the heavens -

180
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:52,137
and the earth opened as a small
volcano, and the people...

181
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:58,721
They had a  urns and bags,
, and they collected them, souls!

182
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:03,774
Do not you understand? - I really do not.

183
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:11,984
I can find Robbyn and talk to him.
No, you can not blame me.

184
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:16,707
I do not you should.
I do not blame did not know, Rich.

185
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:24,632
Is that what this is all about? In this case, the
I'm sorry.

186
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:34,214
Maybe you go to talk to someone? Debbie.
Henderson recommended.

187
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:39,678
Settle this mess. Please,
do not bother to be like that.

188
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:45,225
Be what? I'm serious.

189
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,320
Listen.

190
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:54,526
Write Robbylle. Something
want me to say to him.

191
00:35:54,527 --> 00:36:01,001
I will say just about anything. Write
message from you and Rubylta.

192
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:05,627
Jamie, you do not write.

193
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:11,007
Write  now!
The Lord's sake, get me...

194
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:18,685
I am afraid of you.
I do not understand what is happening and why.

195
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:23,940
But please stop.

196
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:33,488
Two days is Christmas Eve.

197
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,953
I'm sorry.

198
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:46,580
I have to do this.

199
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:59,133
The last goodbye. The soul can get back to the physical form of human
-

200
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:05,141
a while. Then it thank
pickers delivery -

201
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:10,354
and say the last goodbye
before leaving the country.

202
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:17,987
All those people. .Jotka See
overnight glassy eyes.

203
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:23,866
With a selection of boxes,
urns, whatever.

204
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,785
What do they only get their hands on.

205
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:31,587
They picked up the souls. Dead
dear and close.

206
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:40,052
They will find the soul through the
sleep and send it to heaven.

207
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:46,853
But if the soul is not
anyone who cares...

208
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:53,312
If no one has the
loved, it's black soul.

209
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:57,864
Then it stays here and
returns to the fire of hell.

210
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:05,492
When the obsession takes over,
, nothing is insignificant.

211
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:12,208
Moments in life are the signs.
Questions remain unanswered.

212
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:19,055
The riddle remains the norm.

213
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:15,769
Provide details of the afternoon.
Paper.

214
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:19,365
Right. Right.

215
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:25,031
Yeah? - This was the night
Baxter.

216
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,376
It is a graph of the
south-western parts of the above.

217
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:39,835
What does it mean, Gibbons?
- It can be anything.

218
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:43,090
It can be something
very dangerous.

219
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:48,604
It may even be a fault Baxter
.

220
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:53,891
Impossible. - The thing is, however,
investigated.

221
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:57,436
A test very carefully.

222
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:04,776
Preparing to. 0 degrees Kelvin is impossible to implement
artificially.

223
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,371
Physically impossible.

224
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:12,784
20 years ago the Baxter
was considered impossible.

225
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:17,539
Something is amiss.
Absolute zero is the theory.

226
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:22,252
The nearest equivalent is one of the
nebuloosa in outer space.

227
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:26,256
High school chemistry student can say
impossibility.

228
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:31,762
I do not ask for anything in the status report.
I like you worried about -

229
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:36,642
seriousness of the situation and the theoretical impossibility.

230
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:42,491
I ask you the experience-based
your perception of all this.

231
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:49,081
What it is, it
is not of this world.

232
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:43,191
Who are you? Can be more embarrassing

233
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:50,358
?

234
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:54,159
What else should I say?
- That's just more embarrassment.

235
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,448
He's trying to say that it would be in place to greet
. That's right.

236
00:42:56,449 --> 00:43:01,536
Hi. - Hi.

237
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:06,750
Piikittelet Why is it always me? Not
you need me to observe.

238
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:12,303
I do not observe, but to fix.
Otherwise, you do not learn from your mistakes.

239
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:17,385
What is your name, stranger?
- Rich.

240
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:21,357
Hey, Rich. - Hey, I'm...

241
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:26,821
No need to explain, we are friendly to
.

242
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,858
I'm sorry, I'm Grace. - Grace?

243
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,569
Grace and all the other...
- Jermaine.

244
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:39,792
Andrew. - Where's Arnie?

245
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,546
I do not care. - I'm sorry,
that I came to disturb.

246
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:49,720
I forgive you.

247
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:59,555
We come here every night.
Not just here, but every night.

248
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:06,518
We have a kind of tradition.
- Kutsumuksellinen obsession.

249
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:13,567
Hobby, which includes
camping and viewing.

250
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:19,416
We do not look at the stars. For it
is not in the sky, but in the country.

251
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:27,372
Watch in the country to see them.
You seem to know what I'm talking about.

252
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,922
You were actually the same errand.

253
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:37,551
How you know? - No
a lot of people move here.

254
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:43,936
And you have that look.
- What's gaze?

255
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:48,440
As you would have seen God.

256
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,241
Now is the time.

257
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:19,574
You do not sleep a lot?
- I'm not at night.

258
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:25,031
I have become in recent weeks
night person.

259
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:30,630
The same with us. Hard to sleep when the
at night so much is happening.

260
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:39,004
I hope I do not switch off the idea.
You looked intently.

261
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:46,105
I thought.
I watched only.

262
00:46:48,848 --> 00:46:53,149
I try not to think about anymore.
Yes, it is easier.

263
00:46:57,106 --> 00:47:01,577
But I would like to ask you something.
- Let's hear it.

264
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:10,587
How the information can live with?
When you know -

265
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:16,588
that God really exists.

266
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:21,847
You know it before thinking...

267
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:26,136
Because the Church says so, and
parents say their child.

268
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,515
Back of the head was still always the suspicion.

269
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:37,979
When you do something bad -

270
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:43,987
can convince himself that God does not exist.
No, it's not so bad.

271
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:51,203
Then you're doing something good, and you say:

272
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:55,089
"Okay, God,
reward me."

273
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:03,432
That it is true
beyond comprehension.

274
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,763
Thats us...

275
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,485
Considered  so close eye on.

276
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:22,075
You think pretty much the man,
who does not want to think about.

277
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:30,159
I do not try to understand it.
Hulluksihan it should be.

278
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:36,496
I try to live my heart and instinct, according to my.

279
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:40,752
They are divine qualities in this world.

280
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:49,970
You would be best to give the brain a rest
-

281
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:57,645
and monitor the heart and soul.
So get to him.

282
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,697
Thank you.

283
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,823
Good night.

284
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,900
Good morning, Richard. - Good morning.

285
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:45,356
Where do tonight? Middle-aged
about 20 miles away.

286
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:50,989
A couple of oldies 3 miles away.
Both start at 01.13.

287
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:56,534
I want to see something new.
- Where's toddlers are?

288
00:49:56,535 --> 00:50:02,417
Forget them. Too depressing.
Little husbands are the best.

289
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:08,056
Their loved ones wobble syrup...

290
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:14,719
No, middle-aged
get the widest sampling.

291
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:21,100
There are pimps, whores, gangsters and
proffia. Do you remember John McCainen?

292
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:26,449
There one sees celebrities.
- This is how it is.

293
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:31,945
Arnie, considered to be the elderly.
- I'm always in favor of the majority.

294
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,239
You get to decide.

295
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,417
What would you vote for Rich? -
How do you know all this?

296
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:42,664
Where it all?

297
00:50:42,665 --> 00:50:50,140
Time, place, age. You know exactly
every night...

298
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,638
We have documented the
outputs and pickers.

299
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:03,268
After years begin to show a pattern.
The purgatory is on schedule.

300
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:09,607
What about maps and spreadsheets, Rich?
- They look like just the place.

301
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:15,832
You know, therefore, where, when and how
old souls are?

302
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,000
Unbelievable.

303
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:27,335
Rich is looking for his son, and we
help him search.

304
00:52:15,758 --> 00:52:20,845
Arnie, this is the place
but it does not start for a while yet.

305
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:25,516
There is a place below,
which could see something -

306
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,270
just a few minutes.
You're in control.

307
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:40,116
It's nice, when it comes to
new people.

308
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:47,210
I think it's nice that there is
other equally crazy as I am.

309
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:53,008
You're not crazy, Rich.
You're just a crazy situation.

310
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:34,887
Rich? What's going on?

311
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:40,761
Rich? - He is Jamie, my wife.

312
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:49,060
Rich, I do not think so. - He is the only
kyhjöttänyt at home.

313
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:53,940
He does not even believe in, and now he gets
Robbyn first create a. No way!

314
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:56,905
Rich! - I have to see Robby.

315
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:40,699
Jamie... I'm sorry.

316
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:47,418
Rich.

317
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:59,763
Sorry, Rich.

318
00:55:05,177 --> 00:55:07,475
Who is he?

319
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,602
His mother.

320
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:35,957
There is a swing hard. The best thing to put
heavily armed men about it.

321
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:39,252
The best husband.
Errors can not afford.

322
00:55:39,253 --> 00:55:42,507
Errors, Hobbs? It is the smallest
concern.

323
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:47,557
This is not a war, but the research.
The Ministry of Security -

324
00:55:47,558 --> 00:55:52,775
is ready to provide any assistance
completely secure evacuation.

325
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:56,563
You do not know what is needed there.
My husband can not cover everything.

326
00:55:56,564 --> 00:56:00,283
Your husband will not...
- We need to focus on...

327
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:07,822
Lieutenant Commander Sterling.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

328
00:56:07,823 --> 00:56:12,454
I want to talk to you, gentlemen
Palatier and Gibbons.

329
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,581
This is the then top secret.

330
00:56:16,582 --> 00:56:22,587
The President sent a special forces operation
10 years ago.

331
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:27,633
"Operation Firefly". Only 3 people
in the White House knew about it -

332
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:32,390
and it soon swept under the carpet
twin towers after impact.

333
00:56:34,141 --> 00:56:39,562
Drones looked the same as BAXTER now.

334
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:42,863
This image southwestern area.

335
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:48,243
None of the technology does not explain the phenomenon,
but this was a thermal camera.

336
00:56:55,829 --> 00:57:02,132
At night, something strange happens,
, and has been ever since.

337
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:09,467
Persons  decided to leave the
ignored. I with the others.

338
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:14,144
2007 Michael Newdow took the
of the Supreme Court in front of the story -

339
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:18,277
trying to remove uskollisuuden-
whales phrase "name of God".

340
00:57:18,278 --> 00:57:23,439
The case was considered to be unfounded, and was not processed.

341
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:30,154
The president dismissed the case due to fear of
a.

342
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:33,699
Fear,
that we now have to face.

343
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,330
Vasgloben When the news reached the President finds
-

344
00:57:37,331 --> 00:57:41,175
the project came a new light
and it was re-opened.

345
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:48,516
And I watch function
presidential edict.

346
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:58,609
I'll be back, I promise. - No
hurry. Your family needs you.

347
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:07,653
This. I do not expect you to
searching him, but if you...

348
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,404
If you happen to see
him, let me know.

349
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:19,078
Click here to reach me. I want to know.
- Sure. I am looking for a night.

350
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:22,925
I hope you're located,
when we find him.

351
01:01:36,318 --> 01:01:40,619
Father, one more thing.
Guys have a party and...

352
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:47,286
Clean up your room. Mother
nag about it all the time for me.

353
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:52,082
You can do it now.
- Are you kidding me?

354
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:55,085
Oh, my God. -
It was the last word.

355
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:59,307
I do not care. I'm out of here. - Robby!

356
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:16,756
Did you find him? - I do not.
I'm sorry, Rich.

357
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:22,006
I should not have come back.
Your family needs you.

358
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:24,305
Why, then, did you?

359
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:30,806
When did they come from? - At night.
In the morning, everything was in place.

360
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,350
Where are the others?
- Those took them.

361
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:38,647
We met another group.
When I returned as a gunslinger.

362
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:42,494
Do you know who they were?
- They talked about Vasglobesta.

363
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:48,872
Four hours of the time received.
Staff information, please.

364
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:29,708
Mr. Hadley. I'm really sorry for the confusion
.

365
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,786
I, Herbert Gibbons,
in this Edgar Palatier.

366
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:38,290
I Vasgloben BAXTER program
task manager.

367
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,918
I know who you are.

368
01:04:40,919 --> 01:04:44,093
And we know who you are.

369
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:49,770
I see You've been
Vasglobella for almost 14 years.

370
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:53,523
We were lucky to have
about a loyal employee.

371
01:04:54,808 --> 01:05:02,808
What is the exact job description again?
- I am the spokesman -

372
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,402
Vasgloben less
Department of Rockdale.

373
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:11,198
And you gave an interview with a local satellite channel.

374
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:14,703
So you know Baxter?
- Yes.

375
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:23,509
Good. You will be wondering why we are here
. Do you have information?

376
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:29,802
None. - It is associated with Baxter
very much.

377
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:36,024
Last heat transmission refers to a strange
activity in this region.

378
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:42,398
You certainly know how to
interpret these images?

379
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:46,868
You can see these small spots in the region.

380
01:05:48,528 --> 01:05:52,829
And the larger the red stripes.
- Yes, I see.

381
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:59,037
The spots and stripes point
area to be every night -

382
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:03,167
dramatic temperature fluctuations.

383
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:08,015
Such temperatures have previously been considered impossible.

384
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:10,676
The past?

385
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:16,223
So, until recently.
- I understand.

386
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,475
Really? - After all, it makes sense.

387
01:06:19,476 --> 01:06:25,108
I would say that about all. No it is not.
Why it makes sense to you?

388
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:32,155
I just meant that
I understand what you are saying.

389
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,500
So epäilimmekin.

390
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,704
Why are you here?

391
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:51,423
You have experienced something incredible -

392
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:58,353
and that is why we want to ask you
nocturnal visually.

393
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:10,410
Mr. Hadley. Yet
one question.

394
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,618
What do you see at night?

395
01:07:21,329 --> 01:07:23,582
Of stars.

396
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:29,929
Excavation center
pressure suits for deployment.

397
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:57,134
Palatier Lord, I guess you realize that it is
is too far-fetched.

398
01:08:57,135 --> 01:09:02,721
Doctor, all this evening
seen is very far-fetched.

399
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:09,269
Yes, it is. She weighed 74 pounds and
43 grams before his death.

400
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:13,148
76 seconds later, 4 seconds after the death of
-

401
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:21,000
she weighed 74 pounds and 22 grams.
Exactly 21 grams less.

402
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:24,743
Massaako? - 21 grams of pulp -

403
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:27,213
inexplicably disappears from the heart stops.

404
01:09:27,214 --> 01:09:32,177
The theory is that at death...
- Soul...

405
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:39,843
leave the body. 21 grams of pulp
leaves the body metaphysically.

406
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,729
Wonderland.

407
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:54,108
Two months later

408
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:06,207
seems to be lucky.
- A little to the north. Soon it will be displayed.

409
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:10,924
Camp? - No. This is
Rich States.

410
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:15,335
We will stay only for a moment. - And the shit.
I put the tent up.

411
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:20,632
A perfect night, Grace.
- How do you know?

412
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:25,855
Dreamed about her again last night.
The Moon was his favorite thing.

413
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:56,010
Rich, wait. - Grace, it's him.
I feel it.

414
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:02,134
Wait one minute. - Why?
I am tired of waiting.

415
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,229
Rich!

416
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,964
I'm sorry.

417
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:49,314
Grace. He goes out of hand.
He ??can not stay here.

418
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:54,810
He will destroy the souls of the possibilities.
I do not want to be in his presence.

419
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,939
None of us want that.

420
01:11:57,563 --> 01:12:05,118
He is a friend, which has its own
journey, but we have ours.

421
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:08,582
He should not to lead us.

422
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:13,208
This he must do by yourself.
Do not you see it?

423
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:17,459
I understand.

424
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:26,510
Therefore, her on too. You will not be
feel like dancing to the tune of others -

425
01:12:27,301 --> 01:12:34,560
Rich  but needs me.
- He has a wife, Grace.

426
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:41,898
I know that. I did not go to his
marry him, I'll help only.

427
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:47,781
Can you help? Would you have left me
unless there would be in such a hurry to help him?

428
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:58,629
Rich! Rich!

429
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:06,883
Rich!

430
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:08,861
Tell the angels, Daddy.

431
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:15,408
It is in the archangels
that the cherubim.

432
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:20,711
Then there is the heaven of angels singing.

433
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:27,464
And of course, guardian angels.
They protect each to their own human.

434
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:32,425
Also you have a shoulder.
- Where is that?

435
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:36,681
There it is, you just do not see it.

436
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:46,815
I'll teach you a little first
technique prior to the throw.

437
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:52,289
Always a step back,
thread and throwing.

438
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,663
Well.

439
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:06,503
Pull  when the jerks and then rewind in.
Do not give up.

440
01:15:06,504 --> 01:15:10,505
As you continue, the fish surrenders
and you can drag it ashore.

441
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,601
Anna, I'll try to! - Okay.

442
01:15:14,927 --> 01:15:19,478
"The Greeks called their land
Hellaaksi him."

443
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:25,563
Now is the time to sleep, Robby.

444
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:34,313
Daddy? Do you sing a lullaby yet?
- One only.

445
01:16:04,351 --> 01:16:08,106
Monitor indicates that this area
happens next bulge.

446
01:16:08,107 --> 01:16:11,905
Drilling is
start immediately if we are going to make.

447
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:21,001
Are you sure this works?

448
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:26,790
It is a deadly counter-
contact with the air.

449
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:32,173
If your machine gets it up before the
surface, no problems should not be.

450
01:16:35,758 --> 01:16:38,261
Right. Drill off the ground.

451
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:01,751
Stop. Make the diagnosis.

452
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:08,667
Are you sure picker do not know about this?
It is, therefore, come to the surface?

453
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:13,262
Yes.

454
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:39,285
It is very beautiful. - It's funny,
that you see it that way.

455
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:45,753
So is karhunpentukin until
game warden put it in the cage.

456
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:49,708
I think you're opposed to it.

457
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:53,168
Why?

458
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:57,797
Curiosity to get you to repeat the
of Adam and Eve's sin.

459
01:17:57,798 --> 01:18:01,098
All information
is not intended for humans.

460
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:05,263
Do not you understand that this is not only a scientific
try out?

461
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:12,569
It is life. Spirit, who has been sacrificed
and on behalf of which has been sacrificed.

462
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:19,370
I agreed to help you, and I sold my soul to the devil
.

463
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:23,659
Your time has come to pay me a ransom
.

464
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:37,172
Father. - Grace.

465
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:44,561
Escort both
away.

466
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:54,103
Let's start with the transfer to removable tank.
Morning till the time -

467
01:18:54,104 --> 01:18:56,948
before the soul disintegrates.

468
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:02,779
Demographic Research done.
Let's start with the genetic structure of the study.

469
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:07,116
Calculate the memory of neurological networks. The nuclease
synapses.

470
01:19:07,117 --> 01:19:11,537
How much time? -
Two hours to dawn.

471
01:19:11,538 --> 01:19:14,883
Let's start with the cytoplasm
kernel distribution.

472
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:22,509
It can cause serious damage to the structure of the
.

473
01:19:22,675 --> 01:19:25,178
I know.

474
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:30,395
We are already well advanced. Collected all the data.
Ready incision.

475
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:35,029
Stop it! - Guards the scene.

476
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:38,282
The moment Palatier. Please.

477
01:19:40,651 --> 01:19:47,956
Have you ever loved something so
to do everything in front of it?

478
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:51,708
Even you died for it?

479
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:57,092
I've given up everything
To find my son.

480
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:05,552
Sacrificed my whole life.
Up to my family.

481
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:12,475
I'm not going to let my son be lost.

482
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:16,312
He's...

483
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:20,237
my trip.

484
01:20:21,942 --> 01:20:24,991
And if you do not give him to me
-

485
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:34,877
I'm going to help her body
each bone and the muscle.

486
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:45,099
Give him to me.

487
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:30,515
Robby Hadley...

488
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,642
I should have known.

489
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,552
Thank you.

490
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:12,760
No one is released before the
fully conscious soul.

491
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,435
Watch out and hurry.

492
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:22,487
Go on, Rich. - God bless you.

493
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:39,414
Gentlemen. It is mine,
White House -

494
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:46,669
and no doubt the whole nation in the interests of -

495
01:22:46,670 --> 01:22:50,965
that this project will be buried immediately.

496
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:54,135
All the information of the existence of
disposed of -

497
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:59,438
And all participants
swear eternal vow of silence.

498
01:23:00,517 --> 01:23:06,189
This is one of those moments when we have to accept
-

499
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:11,569
that there are things in the world,
that we should not intervene.

500
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:14,039
