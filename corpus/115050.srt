1
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:04,954
Man: Trees have a secret life
that is only revealed

2
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,966
to those who are willing
to climb them.

3
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,474
I do not remember
when I was born.

4
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,141
But, when I was three
months old,

5
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,780
my mother returned
to my grandparents' home

6
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:31,222
with me as the proof
of her failure.

7
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:56,771
The splendor of my childhood
was unique,

8
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,214
because of its absolute poverty,
and absolute freedom...

9
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,886
out in the open,

10
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:09,224
surrounded by trees,
animals, and people

11
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,628
who were indifferent
toward me.

12
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,339
Grandmother: Reinaldo!

13
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,506
Reinaldo!

14
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,613
Niño, apúrate con esa agua,
Dios mío!

15
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,585
Mira que hay que esperar
en esta casa!

16
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,249
My early life was surrounded
by a room full of unhappy women

17
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,726
who were all bossed around
by my grandmother,

18
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,752
the heart of the house,

19
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,731
the only woman I ever saw
who peed standing up

20
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:49,326
and talked to God
at the same time.

21
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:55,008
My mother was a very beautiful
and very lonely woman.

22
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:58,000
She had only known one man,
my father,

23
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:02,344
and had enjoyed the pleasures
of love for only a few months

24
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:07,115
and then, gave that all up
for the rest of her life,

25
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:11,556
creating in her
a great sense of frustration.

26
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,424
Her chastity was worse
than that of a virgin.

27
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,257
Hijo de puta!

28
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,389
Vete de aquí!

29
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,124
Animal!

30
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,806
Hijo de puta!

31
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:44,282
Desgraciado!

32
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,918
The most extraordinary
event of my childhood

33
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,019
was provided by the heavens.

34
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,054
Water rushed down gutters,

35
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:55,727
reverberating over
the zinc roof like gunfire

36
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:58,794
a massive army marching
across the trees,

37
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:04,401
overflowing, cascading,
thundering into barrels,

38
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,776
a concert of drums,

39
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:08,747
water falling on water,

40
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:12,046
drenched and whistling
and out of control,

41
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,246
and under the spell of violence,

42
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:18,992
let loose that would sweep away
almost everything in its path.

43
00:04:18,993 --> 00:04:22,826
Trees, stones,
animals, houses.

44
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,921
It was the mystery
of destruction.

45
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,762
The law of life.

46
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,495
As I saw it,

47
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,901
the currents were
roaring my name.

48
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,877
Flowers have
reproductive organs.

49
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:43,780
Class, can anyone
tell us what the male

50
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,876
reproductive organ is called?

51
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,886
Reinaldo?

52
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:54,491
Reinaldo?

53
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:57,587
A dick.
A long, skinny dick.

54
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:07,401
Don't ask her where
she comes from.

55
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,409
Can't you see she
is from the garden

56
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:14,038
and the most beautiful
flower of them all?

57
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,154
Buenas tardes,
con permiso.

58
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,250
Señor Fuentes, I didn't mean
to disturb your dinner.

59
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,694
What did he do?

60
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,221
No, he didn't do
anything wrong.

61
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:10,599
I came here to tell you that
Reinaldo has a special gift.

62
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,561
What special gift?

63
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,404
He has a sensitivity
for poetry.

64
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,227
After that, my grandfather
sold the farm

65
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,103
and moved the family
to Holguín,

66
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,266
opened a grocery store,

67
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,538
and refused to speak
to any of us.

68
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,880
Holguín was a town
of 200,000 people

69
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,978
and one garbage truck.

70
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:59,607
The rebels are in Velasco.

71
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,545
We can walk it in a day.

72
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:03,549
Okay.

73
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,551
We'll leave tonight.

74
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,018
'Tá bien.

75
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:10,113
You think you can
do it with her?

76
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,522
My name is Reinaldo.
What is yours?

77
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:13,889
Loly.

78
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,554
- Would you like to dance?
- Cómo no.

79
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,143
¿Qué tú quieres?
Tú eres muy niño.

80
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,023
( radio announcer )
Incorpórate a la lucha.

81
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:50,689
Radio Rebelde, transmitiendo
desde las montañas de Oriente,

82
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,221
desde la Sierra Maestra,

83
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:56,235
territorio libre de Cuba.

84
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,396
Aquí Radio Rebelde.

85
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:28,926
Where are you going, kid?

86
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,657
- Up the road.
- Up the road where?

87
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:32,789
Velasco.

88
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,129
Velasco?
You are not from Velasco.

89
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:41,731
I am from Velasco.
Why do you go to Velasco for?

90
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:45,232
Ah, the rebels
are in Velasco.

91
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,177
You going to join
the rebels?

92
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:51,017
Your mamá know you are
going to join the rebels?

93
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,484
No.

94
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:53,712
No.

95
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,277
Where she is?

96
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,482
She's in Miami, working.

97
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:07,125
Would you like to see?

98
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:11,432
It's upside down.

99
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,097
Qué bonita.

100
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,403
You want to hit things?

101
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:26,579
Sometimes I like
to hit things.

102
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:31,955
My mother, she has
a store in Velasco.

103
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:35,427
Before that it was my
grandmother's store,

104
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:38,021
and before that,
it was her mother's store.

105
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,759
I have six brothers.

106
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,394
They all want
to join the rebels.

107
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,132
The second one,
he joined the rebels.

108
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:50,632
I'm the middle one,
I don't join the rebels.

109
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,041
( car horn honking )

110
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,047
Get that for me.

111
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,291
Go home.

112
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,663
The rebels are no more
in Velasco.

113
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,795
Go on, get off.

114
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,100
Get off!

115
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,800
What?
What?

116
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,429
Que viva Fidel!

117
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,062
Viva Fidel!

118
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,163
Cuba libre!

119
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,692
Translator: Es todo por hoy.

120
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,193
( together )
Spaziva!

121
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:52,807
As my mother smacked me,
she cursed

122
00:15:52,851 --> 00:15:55,945
and yelled, "Maldito!
Bad seed!"

123
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,513
She shouted at the sky,
"I want to get out of here."

124
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,720
But I really wasn't sure
that's what she wanted.

125
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:10,668
But now standing over me

126
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,728
she looked like
a huge tree trunk.

127
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:18,073
And if it didn't hurt so much,
I'd get down on my knees,

128
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,273
and ask her to smack me again,
even harder.

129
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,809
Then she became beautiful.

130
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,650
How pretty she is in her skirt
made out of a sack

131
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,747
and the blouse she stole
from her sister.

132
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,486
I wanted to get up and beg
her forgiveness.

133
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:39,190
I wanted to say,
"Mom, how pretty you are today.

134
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,892
You look like
one of those women

135
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,094
that you can only see
on Christmas cards,"

136
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:48,038
but I said nothing because
of the the knot in my throat.

137
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,769
That was very nice.
What's your name?

138
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:55,336
Reinaldo Arenas.

139
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,973
Who wrote this?

140
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:59,483
I did, it's my own--
from my novel.

141
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,213
What do you call this novel?

142
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,914
"Singing from the Well."

143
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,479
Are you a student?

144
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,084
Yes, I'm an agricultural
accountant.

145
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,892
Tell me, do you think
you'd feel at home

146
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,731
working in the national library?

147
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,738
The pay won't be very much.

148
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,605
But I can promise you
that you'll have all the books

149
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,438
you could ever hope to read.

150
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,341
I would like that
very much.

151
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,777
Thank you very much.

152
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:32,250
Thank you.

153
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,963
Oye, need a lift?

154
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,527
I want to go down
to Guayanos.

155
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,596
Get in.

156
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,209
Hello.

157
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:05,078
Driver: You like it, right?

158
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,553
It used to belong
to Errol Flynn.

159
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,487
You don't believe me?

160
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,013
Look in the glove
compartment.

161
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:20,495
Be careful, huh?

162
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,533
Do you want to go
to the movies with me?

163
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,696
What?

164
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,364
Do you want to go
to the movies with me?

165
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,931
- I'll get out here!
- Ay, coño!

166
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,613
You got a flat ass anyway!

167
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,914
Vamos, chico, vamos!

168
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,351
You'll see him tomorrow.

169
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:43,286
Get out!

170
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:51,489
Estúpido!

171
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,766
...last Saturday night
I made 100 pesos

172
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,601
for letting 10 members
of the National Ballet

173
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,833
suck me off.

174
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:05,033
Doesn't that make you a fag?

175
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:07,272
If you do it for money,
you're not a fag.

176
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:45,880
You know him?

177
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:46,907
No.

178
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:53,691
Hello.

179
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:55,090
I'm sorry about the other day.

180
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,185
No, don't worry.
Forget it.

181
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,219
- I am Reinaldo.
- I am Pepe.

182
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,254
- How about some ice cream?
- Yes!

183
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,324
Today they have only vanilla.

184
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,565
Bring him a banana split
with pistacho.

185
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,368
One ice cream!

186
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:09,703
Go.

187
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,507
So where you from,
Reinaldo?

188
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,706
I am a guajiro,
from Oriente.

189
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,715
- Does it matter where I'm from?
- No.

190
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,148
What do you do?

191
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,948
I just got a job now
in the National Library,

192
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,649
but I would like to be
a writer.

193
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,053
You poor thing.

194
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,619
A country boy in Havana
to serve the Revolution.

195
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,946
- Where's your mother?
- En la bodega.

196
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,883
Give me the key.

197
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,647
Chau.

198
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:55,618
Vamos!

199
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,727
She says it works,

200
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,932
just one key is a little off.

201
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,168
How can I thank you?

202
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,044
What are you doing?

203
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:24,412
Who is the man?

204
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:27,713
Who's the man?

205
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,449
You, because you are
the judo expert.

206
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,219
You don't kiss
on the lips?

207
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,765
Only when I'm in love.

208
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:48,167
Patricio Lamumba Beach is only
a 10 minute walk from here--

209
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:51,232
La Concha is about a mile...

210
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,244
This is perfect for you.

211
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:57,339
You'll have to share
the bathroom with her.

212
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,782
Bedsheets are changed
every two weeks

213
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,787
and you are responsible
for your own towel.

214
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:05,018
It is perfect, I'll take it.

215
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,582
Don't you want to know
how much?

216
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,594
It doesn't matter,
I can not afford it anyway.

217
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:12,028
30 pesos a month--

218
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,392
and no visitors...

219
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,460
nor music after 10:00pm.

220
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,465
30.

221
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,948
Thank you.

222
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,306
National Book Award Contest.

223
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,971
Hello.

224
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,674
I would like
to submit this please.

225
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:05,046
Put it in the box.

226
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,438
Hey, you want a smoke?

227
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:21,638
No, thank you.

228
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:37,261
What are you reading?

229
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,593
Este es "El Lazarillo
de Tormes."

230
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,064
Who wrote it?

231
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,667
No author,
he's anonymous.

232
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,798
No writer?
That's impossible.

233
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:53,333
No, no, no,
I didn't say no writer.

234
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:55,039
I said we don't know
who the author is.

235
00:26:56,715 --> 00:27:00,708
Okay.
Do you have any other books?

236
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:02,720
Yes, I have many.

237
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,891
I usually read out here
so I can be alone.

238
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:10,554
I like it here.

239
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,790
Sorry to bother you.
I'll leave.

240
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:14,992
It's okay.
I'm going home anyway.

241
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,702
You live around here?

242
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:27,234
Not far.

243
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,276
You want to come over
and hear some music?

244
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,943
What?

245
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,645
I have some
French records.

246
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:35,675
Maybe you like...

247
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:42,219
Edith Piaf,
and Jacques Brel.

248
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,021
Pero estúpido idiota!

249
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:49,499
Are you out of your mind?

250
00:27:49,534 --> 00:27:50,796
Take the book with you.

251
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:54,230
Ojalá se te caiga
la pinga, maricón!

252
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,399
Estúpido!
Coño.

253
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,939
And so, ladies and gentlemen,

254
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:06,016
we have arrived at this
auspicious moment.

255
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:10,044
We are happy to announce
that the first prize goes to,

256
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:13,922
"Vivir en Candonga"
by Ezequiel Vieta.

257
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:31,638
And the honorable mention
goes to Reinaldo Arenas

258
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,803
for "Celestino Antes de Alba."

259
00:28:42,787 --> 00:28:44,118
Thank you.
Gracias.

260
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,550
Thank you for coming
ladies and gentlemen,

261
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,584
and another round of applause
for our contestants.

262
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,163
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

263
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:02,969
You're invited to
Lezama Lima's house.

264
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:15,852
Hello.

265
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:45,112
He left after his brother
made the film "P.M."

266
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,549
You've heard about it.

267
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,246
The brother had to leave, too.

268
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,914
Simple film.

269
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:57,056
Just a group of people
dancing and getting drunk.

270
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,594
It made no judgments.

271
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,935
It made no judgments.

272
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:11,131
People that make art are
dangerous to any dictatorship.

273
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:16,677
They create beauty.

274
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,741
And beauty is the enemy.

275
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:24,016
Artists are escapists.

276
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,157
Artists are counter-
revolutionary,

277
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:31,822
and so you are a counter-
revolutionary, Reinaldo Arenas,

278
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,330
and you know why?

279
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:39,827
Because there's a man
that cannot govern

280
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:42,840
the terrain called beauty,
so he wants to eliminate it.

281
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:46,366
So, here we are, 400 years
of Cuban culture

282
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,972
about to become extinct
and everybody applauds.

283
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,481
And what happened to your lip?

284
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,442
I found somebody who doesn't
like French music, that's all.

285
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:57,477
Be careful.
Be careful.

286
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,956
No, no, no.
Keep it--

287
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,891
He would love for you
to have it.

288
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:06,991
There are 150 books that
contain everything

289
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,999
that literature has to offer.

290
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,661
You read them and you don't have
to read anything else.

291
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,500
So which book would
be the first?

292
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,132
"The Bible."
You have to read the Bible.

293
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:18,768
Oh, croquettes.
Ooh, María Luisa.

294
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:27,951
These croquettes don't stick
to the roof of your mouth.

295
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,080
They are delicious.

296
00:31:32,123 --> 00:31:33,147
What kind are they?

297
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,522
I n this country, you don't
ask that question.

298
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,959
We're all being placed
on an international diet.

299
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,087
Let's go back
to the Bible,

300
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,290
it's far
more interesting.

301
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,459
Now, I don't mean
to convert you.

302
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:45,025
Just read it like a novel.

303
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,505
I tell you what, I'm going
to give you five books--

304
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,474
Correction, I'm going to lend
you five books.

305
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:54,637
You return them,
then I'll give you five more.

306
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,806
"Moby Dick," Melville,

307
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:59,715
Robert Lewis Stevenson's
"Treasure lsland,"

308
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,242
Proust's,
"Remembrance of Things Past"

309
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,585
Kafka's "Metamorphosis,"

310
00:32:04,622 --> 00:32:06,920
Flaubert's,
"Sentimental Education."

311
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,750
María Luisa,
coffee please.

312
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:13,129
One, two, three--

313
00:32:13,164 --> 00:32:16,327
four, five.

314
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:19,461
Reinaldo, I don't mean
to be presumptuous,

315
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,131
but we've read your book.

316
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,606
We both think
it's far superior

317
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,336
to the one
that won first prize.

318
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,310
They robbed you
of the first prize.

319
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,972
But, to be frank,

320
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,345
there's always room
for improvement.

321
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:34,444
If you'll allow,

322
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,477
Virgilio would like
to help you clean it up.

323
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,683
Right now it's good,

324
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,192
but it's too good
not to be great.

325
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,523
Let's fix it.

326
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:46,155
Second prize
gets published too.

327
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:47,755
That's the real prize.

328
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,597
We both think that
you were born to write.

329
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,238
( police radio )

330
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,648
You can't be too careful.

331
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:09,517
This is the only possession
that you really need.

332
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,653
...de la vida.

333
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:25,361
Las lagartijas son muy grandes
en este bañado.

334
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:26,870
Si tú las vieras!
Las lagartijas...

335
00:33:26,904 --> 00:33:29,270
tienen aquí distintas formas...

336
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,989
Where's Pepe?

337
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,359
He's getting supplies.

338
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:54,421
I don't have to work today.

339
00:33:54,465 --> 00:33:56,660
Let's pick up
Nicolas and Juan.

340
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,669
Okay.

341
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:02,070
Look, look, Tomás.
"Celestino Antes de Alba."

342
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,073
Now, you are really a writer.

343
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,972
- You like that cover?
- I like it, it's beautiful.

344
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,105
I thank Virgilio
for this book.

345
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,877
He gave me a lesson
in literature and editing.

346
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,343
...my brothers Juan
and Nicholas are writers too.

347
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,682
Oh, come on.

348
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,086
Pepe, we've got the Bronte
sisters in the back-seat.

349
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:19,282
Look at them.

350
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,959
Lezama is a Catholic;
Virgilio is an atheist.

351
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:33,095
So what do they
have in common

352
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:34,536
besides being faggots?

353
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,870
Lezama doesn't type,
he writes everything by hand.

354
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,221
Something you
wouldn't understand

355
00:34:39,222 --> 00:34:41,535
It's called
intellectual honesty.

356
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,014
I don't understand!

357
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,609
Well, if you took the time
to actually read their books,

358
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,915
maybe you'd have something
intelligent to say about it.

359
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,149
Oye,
look at this.

360
00:34:55,497 --> 00:34:56,725
Give him the cigarettes.

361
00:35:02,871 --> 00:35:04,566
Oye, guapo!

362
00:35:19,955 --> 00:35:21,081
Maricones!

363
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,500
Mariquita! ¡Mariquita!

364
00:35:34,536 --> 00:35:36,902
Hazle comer
el mojón de caballo!

365
00:35:46,114 --> 00:35:47,206
( gunshots )

366
00:35:47,916 --> 00:35:50,612
Coño! ¿Qué es eso?

367
00:35:50,652 --> 00:35:51,516
¿Qué pasa ahora?

368
00:35:51,553 --> 00:35:54,283
Oye, welcome to our picnic,
compañero.

369
00:35:54,323 --> 00:35:56,883
Tranquilo,
no te muevas de allí.

370
00:35:56,925 --> 00:35:59,086
- What do you want?
- Shut up.

371
00:36:01,096 --> 00:36:02,290
What do I want?

372
00:36:02,731 --> 00:36:05,256
I want Carlos first
to frisk this guy.

373
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,289
Why him?

374
00:36:06,335 --> 00:36:07,666
See if he's got a weapon.

375
00:36:07,703 --> 00:36:09,170
He's not even dressed.

376
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:12,769
What's your name?

377
00:36:13,942 --> 00:36:15,375
My name?

378
00:36:16,745 --> 00:36:18,576
Franz Kafka.

379
00:36:18,613 --> 00:36:20,672
Franz Kafka.

380
00:36:20,716 --> 00:36:22,240
You're funny.

381
00:36:22,284 --> 00:36:24,275
You think I'm ignorant?

382
00:36:26,254 --> 00:36:27,721
Let's see how
ignorant you are.

383
00:36:27,756 --> 00:36:31,692
Ever heard of a summer camp
called La Isla de la Juventud?

384
00:36:33,628 --> 00:36:38,531
No, then maybe
you can tell me...

385
00:36:39,468 --> 00:36:44,303
when was the last time
you took it up your ass?

386
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:46,671
The last time?

387
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:48,107
Oh, I don't remember.

388
00:36:48,377 --> 00:36:51,039
You don't remember?

389
00:36:52,114 --> 00:36:54,082
But, I remember
the last time you did.

390
00:36:54,116 --> 00:36:57,643
When was that?

391
00:36:57,686 --> 00:36:59,517
Maybe the last time
you bent over

392
00:36:59,554 --> 00:37:00,953
to tie your boots?

393
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:21,037
Está bien,
lo ves, ¿no?

394
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:28,811
Está bien, está bien.

395
00:37:32,487 --> 00:37:33,681
Do you have a cigarette?

396
00:37:33,722 --> 00:37:37,317
Yes, I have a cigarette.

397
00:37:47,035 --> 00:37:49,060
There was also a sexual
revolution going on

398
00:37:49,104 --> 00:37:52,767
that came along with excitement
of the official revolution--

399
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:59,879
but the drums of militarism
were still trying to beat down

400
00:37:59,915 --> 00:38:02,884
the rhythm of poetry and life.

401
00:38:04,953 --> 00:38:07,353
When I wasn't at my job
at the library,

402
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:10,688
or guard duty,
or attending rallies,

403
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,088
there were three
wonderful things

404
00:38:13,128 --> 00:38:15,255
that I enjoyed
in the 60's:

405
00:38:15,764 --> 00:38:20,098
my typewriter, at which I sat
like a dedicated performer

406
00:38:20,135 --> 00:38:21,796
sitting at his piano;

407
00:38:22,771 --> 00:38:24,739
the youth of those days,

408
00:38:24,773 --> 00:38:27,298
when everyone was ready
to break free;

409
00:38:27,943 --> 00:38:31,879
and lastly, the full discovery
of the sea.

410
00:40:09,244 --> 00:40:11,940
Did you ever notice there
are four categories of gays?

411
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,175
Really?

412
00:40:14,216 --> 00:40:14,739
Really.

413
00:40:14,783 --> 00:40:16,341
Which are they?

414
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,842
Well, the first one
is the dog collar gay--

415
00:40:19,888 --> 00:40:20,912
He's loud,

416
00:40:20,956 --> 00:40:23,891
shows off that
he's gay,

417
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:26,223
there's no limit
to his sexual voracity,

418
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:29,025
therefore he's constantly
being arrested.

419
00:40:29,064 --> 00:40:31,396
The system has created
a permanent collar

420
00:40:31,433 --> 00:40:32,627
around his neck,

421
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:33,895
so they can
hook him up

422
00:40:33,935 --> 00:40:35,425
and take him to
a rehabilitation camp

423
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,801
like a Valparaíso.

424
00:40:37,105 --> 00:40:39,335
Two is the common gay.

425
00:40:39,374 --> 00:40:41,808
He's made his commitments
with other gays,

426
00:40:41,843 --> 00:40:44,073
has a job, film clubs,

427
00:40:44,112 --> 00:40:46,307
likes to sip tea
with his friends,

428
00:40:46,348 --> 00:40:47,838
writes a poem
now and then,

429
00:40:47,882 --> 00:40:49,816
only has relations
with other gays,

430
00:40:49,851 --> 00:40:51,284
never takes a risk,

431
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:53,412
and never gets
to know a real man.

432
00:40:53,788 --> 00:40:55,881
The third one,

433
00:40:55,924 --> 00:40:57,186
the closet gay,
okay,

434
00:40:57,225 --> 00:40:58,487
nobody knows
he is gay.

435
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:00,858
He's married,
has children,

436
00:41:00,895 --> 00:41:02,920
hides on his way
to the bathroom,

437
00:41:02,964 --> 00:41:05,762
still wearing the ring
that his wife gave him.

438
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,633
They're hard to spot,
but I've got one here.

439
00:41:12,707 --> 00:41:15,232
Most of the time they're
the ones who censor other gays.

440
00:41:23,618 --> 00:41:24,585
And fourth, the royal gay,

441
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:26,314
a unique product
of our country,

442
00:41:26,354 --> 00:41:27,480
a communist country.

443
00:41:27,522 --> 00:41:31,925
Because of his closeness
to our Maximum Leader

444
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,985
or special work with
the State Security,

445
00:41:34,029 --> 00:41:37,157
he can afford
to be openly gay,

446
00:41:37,232 --> 00:41:40,133
travel freely in this
country and abroad,

447
00:41:40,168 --> 00:41:42,864
cover himself
with jewels, clothes...

448
00:41:42,904 --> 00:41:46,704
Coño, he even has
a private chauffeur.

449
00:41:53,248 --> 00:41:56,183
Hey, hey.
Stop!

450
00:41:56,251 --> 00:41:57,843
Reinaldo!

451
00:41:57,886 --> 00:41:59,547
Hey, Reinaldo!

452
00:41:59,587 --> 00:42:02,147
Come on.
We'll give you a ride.

453
00:42:06,995 --> 00:42:08,826
Where are you going?

454
00:42:08,863 --> 00:42:09,887
Don't worry.
Take a seat.

455
00:42:11,366 --> 00:42:13,734
Hello.

456
00:42:13,735 --> 00:42:14,827
How are you?

457
00:42:19,741 --> 00:42:23,837
Now, we're going to take
a little shortcut

458
00:42:23,878 --> 00:42:26,108
and show you a beautiful
part of Havana

459
00:42:26,147 --> 00:42:28,741
that not many
visitors get to see.

460
00:43:50,365 --> 00:43:53,027
The crackdown began in earnest.

461
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:56,093
The horror and ugliness
advanced day by day

462
00:43:56,137 --> 00:43:58,196
at an ever increasing pace,

463
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:02,369
but the oppression only
acted as a stimulus

464
00:44:03,044 --> 00:44:05,376
and sex became a way
of fighting it...

465
00:44:05,447 --> 00:44:08,314
a weapon to use
against the regimen.

466
00:45:45,847 --> 00:45:47,246
Needless to say,

467
00:45:47,282 --> 00:45:49,876
the Revolution wasn't
for everybody.

468
00:45:49,918 --> 00:45:53,684
Mr. Heberto Zorrilla Ochoa,

469
00:45:53,721 --> 00:45:58,749
are you aware of Article 243
in the Penal Code?

470
00:45:58,793 --> 00:45:59,725
Yes.

471
00:46:00,528 --> 00:46:04,726
And what does Article 243
of the Penal Code state?

472
00:46:04,766 --> 00:46:09,100
It states that no assembly
of over three people is allowed.

473
00:46:09,137 --> 00:46:13,631
And yet, you had an assembly
of over 20 people at your home

474
00:46:13,675 --> 00:46:15,302
on the night of July 10th.

475
00:46:15,343 --> 00:46:17,208
What were you doing?

476
00:46:17,245 --> 00:46:19,406
It was a poetry reading.

477
00:46:19,447 --> 00:46:21,608
Whose poetry?

478
00:46:21,649 --> 00:46:24,516
My own--
others.

479
00:46:24,552 --> 00:46:28,181
And are you sure that
this was a poetry reading

480
00:46:28,222 --> 00:46:30,315
and not just an
opportunity to recite

481
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:32,622
counterrevolutionary
propaganda?

482
00:46:33,561 --> 00:46:35,051
Yes, I'm sure.

483
00:46:35,096 --> 00:46:39,692
Mr. Correa, is poetry
ever propaganda?

484
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:43,233
I suppose it could be.

485
00:46:43,271 --> 00:46:46,001
But not your poetry.

486
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,167
No.

487
00:46:48,576 --> 00:46:52,376
Mr. Correa, who else
was present

488
00:46:52,413 --> 00:46:54,779
at this so-called
poetry reading?

489
00:46:56,784 --> 00:46:59,912
Some friends,
other writers.

490
00:46:59,954 --> 00:47:05,290
Tell me, does the name
José Lezama Lima ring a bell?

491
00:47:05,326 --> 00:47:07,692
Virgilio Piñera?

492
00:47:07,729 --> 00:47:09,993
Your wife, Fina?

493
00:47:10,732 --> 00:47:11,892
Yes.

494
00:47:11,933 --> 00:47:13,230
Were they there?

495
00:47:13,267 --> 00:47:15,326
Yes, they were there.

496
00:47:15,370 --> 00:47:18,703
Are you aware
that Lezama Lima

497
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,675
and Virgilio Piñera
are homosexuals?

498
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,371
Yes.

499
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:37,885
I am aware of my errors.

500
00:47:42,263 --> 00:47:44,163
that are unpardonable,

501
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:48,393
errors that demand
to be severely punished.

502
00:47:50,071 --> 00:47:53,302
But I must confess
that I see before me

503
00:47:53,341 --> 00:47:55,172
in this room,

504
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:58,746
the faces of many comrades
who like me,

505
00:47:58,747 --> 00:48:01,044
have lost their way,

506
00:48:01,082 --> 00:48:04,848
whose ideology has waivered,

507
00:48:04,886 --> 00:48:07,684
who have committed
similar errors...

508
00:48:07,722 --> 00:48:15,788
errors that also demand
to be severely punished.

509
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,521
( crowd screams )

510
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,105
I'm sorry.
I'm late.

511
00:49:08,616 --> 00:49:11,016
We got a call about
an hour ago.

512
00:49:11,052 --> 00:49:13,145
They said they would be
at the Hotel Nacional

513
00:49:13,187 --> 00:49:15,417
and they're leaving
today at 4:00 p.m.

514
00:49:15,456 --> 00:49:17,048
That's all they said?

515
00:49:17,091 --> 00:49:19,184
They're friends of
Lezama Lima.

516
00:49:20,461 --> 00:49:22,929
- Reinaldo?
- Yes.

517
00:49:22,964 --> 00:49:24,556
I'm Jorge Camacho.

518
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:27,534
- This is my wife, Margarita.
- Hi.

519
00:49:27,568 --> 00:49:28,933
Have a seat.

520
00:49:31,506 --> 00:49:32,905
We live in Paris.

521
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,170
Jorge is in a show
at the Salón De Mayo.

522
00:49:35,209 --> 00:49:36,471
He's a painter.

523
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:38,342
We are big fans
of your work.

524
00:49:38,379 --> 00:49:40,176
My work?

525
00:49:40,214 --> 00:49:42,341
We bought your book
in a bookstore

526
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:44,647
and Jorge stayed up
all night reading it.

527
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:46,778
He said it was
the greatest novel

528
00:49:46,821 --> 00:49:48,288
he ever read
about childhood.

529
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:51,453
Would you put
the book away, please.

530
00:49:51,492 --> 00:49:52,857
Yes, of course.

531
00:49:57,732 --> 00:49:59,029
Of course.

532
00:52:28,749 --> 00:52:29,909
Reinaldo!

533
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:33,819
Margarita went ahead.

534
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:34,912
I thought you
were gone.

535
00:52:34,956 --> 00:52:36,651
I went to the hotel--
I didn't know.

536
00:52:36,691 --> 00:52:38,886
But, I knew you
were here.

537
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,898
This is a friend
of ours,

538
00:52:44,932 --> 00:52:47,332
who works at
the French Embassy.

539
00:52:47,368 --> 00:52:49,036
If you ever
need anything

540
00:52:49,037 --> 00:52:50,704
you can give
her a call.

541
00:52:50,738 --> 00:52:53,707
She'll get in
touch with us.

542
00:52:53,741 --> 00:52:56,266
It's a small present
from Margarita and me.

543
00:52:56,744 --> 00:52:58,507
Thank you
very much, Jorge.

544
00:52:58,546 --> 00:53:00,480
You have to go.

545
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:01,776
What do your
paintings look like?

546
00:53:01,816 --> 00:53:03,716
Because I didn't
ask you before.

547
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:06,015
You'll have to
see them in person.

548
00:53:06,053 --> 00:53:06,781
Sure.

549
00:53:06,821 --> 00:53:08,015
Who knows?

550
00:53:08,055 --> 00:53:10,148
Maybe you could
write something

551
00:53:10,191 --> 00:53:11,681
about them someday.

552
00:53:50,664 --> 00:53:54,156
Hey Mister,
can I have my kite, please?

553
00:53:54,201 --> 00:53:55,293
Get lost.

554
00:53:55,336 --> 00:53:56,667
You almost killed me.

555
00:53:56,771 --> 00:53:58,830
Come on,
give him the kite.

556
00:53:58,873 --> 00:54:01,000
You want to give
him the kite?

557
00:54:01,042 --> 00:54:02,134
Give him the kite?

558
00:54:02,176 --> 00:54:03,165
Forget it!

559
00:54:05,746 --> 00:54:07,611
Come on,
give him the kite!

560
00:54:07,648 --> 00:54:09,081
Oye!

561
00:54:09,116 --> 00:54:10,481
You want to give
him back the kite?

562
00:54:10,518 --> 00:54:12,110
Okay, I'll give
him the kite.

563
00:54:14,288 --> 00:54:15,585
What are you doing, Pepe?

564
00:54:20,061 --> 00:54:21,926
What are you doing, Pepe?

565
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:24,154
Get out of here!

566
00:54:38,646 --> 00:54:41,479
Aléjate de aquí!
iBruto!

567
00:54:48,522 --> 00:54:50,114
Here.

568
00:55:00,167 --> 00:55:01,225
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

569
00:55:01,268 --> 00:55:03,532
I was on the beach
and these boys

570
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:06,904
stole my flippers
and my clothes.

571
00:55:06,941 --> 00:55:08,742
Could you identify them?

572
00:55:08,743 --> 00:55:11,711
No, but it's okay.

573
00:55:11,745 --> 00:55:13,872
Get in the car.

574
00:55:14,882 --> 00:55:16,281
No, it's okay.

575
00:55:16,317 --> 00:55:18,751
Get in the car.

576
00:55:25,126 --> 00:55:26,923
Ahí están!
That's them!

577
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:34,562
Come over here.

578
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,495
You have something
belonging to this man?

579
00:55:38,873 --> 00:55:39,931
Look at him.

580
00:55:42,943 --> 00:55:45,104
Give me your ID cards.

581
00:55:54,488 --> 00:55:57,321
I was going to return this
stuff to the police station.

582
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:00,486
That faggot and his friend,
tried to touch our pricks.

583
00:56:00,528 --> 00:56:02,155
Yeah, we beat them up
and they ran off,

584
00:56:02,196 --> 00:56:04,494
so, we were going to bring
this to the station.

585
00:56:04,532 --> 00:56:05,897
They molested us.

586
00:56:05,933 --> 00:56:07,400
- They molested you?
- Yeah.

587
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:09,129
- You're sure?
- Yes.

588
00:56:10,137 --> 00:56:11,570
You're under arrest.

589
00:56:11,605 --> 00:56:12,697
Why!

590
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,901
Because I said so.

591
00:56:25,486 --> 00:56:26,748
Lugando Barnes!

592
00:58:38,552 --> 00:58:39,985
What are you doing here?

593
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,419
I live right over here.

594
00:58:41,455 --> 00:58:44,390
I need a towel, t-shirt,
anything you have.

595
00:58:44,425 --> 00:58:45,585
Please.

596
00:58:47,027 --> 00:58:47,755
Thank you.

597
00:58:47,795 --> 00:58:48,887
I need a place to hide.

598
00:58:48,929 --> 00:58:51,056
I don't know,
I have to get out of here.

599
00:58:51,098 --> 00:58:52,497
Why, what did you do?

600
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:54,433
They said I
molested these kids.

601
00:58:54,468 --> 00:58:56,698
You should see these kids.

602
00:58:56,737 --> 00:58:58,227
They were all bigger
than me.

603
00:58:58,305 --> 00:58:59,738
Have you heard from Tomás?

604
00:58:59,773 --> 00:59:03,174
I was told that he was
in a work camp in Oriente

605
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,610
and he was killed
while trying to escape.

606
00:59:05,646 --> 00:59:06,510
I've heard you've
had some trouble

607
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:07,673
with the police.

608
00:59:07,715 --> 00:59:09,046
No, it was a mistake,

609
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:11,278
they had me mixed up
with somebody else.

610
00:59:12,786 --> 00:59:15,482
The way I see it,
you have two choices:

611
00:59:15,522 --> 00:59:19,652
You can try to make it
to the U .S. Navy Base

612
00:59:19,693 --> 00:59:20,819
in Guantánamo;

613
00:59:20,861 --> 00:59:22,954
or you can try to float
your way to Florida.

614
00:59:22,996 --> 00:59:25,487
It's about 90 miles.

615
00:59:25,532 --> 00:59:28,695
You can make it in a few
days if the current is good.

616
00:59:28,736 --> 00:59:31,227
I have an inner tube
I was saving.

617
00:59:31,305 --> 00:59:32,863
It's yours.

618
01:00:00,234 --> 01:00:01,565
( knocking on door )

619
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,054
Who is it?

620
01:00:08,055 --> 01:00:09,368
It's me, Pepe.

621
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:10,843
I'm sorry about today.

622
01:00:13,213 --> 01:00:14,544
What do you want now?

623
01:00:14,581 --> 01:00:15,548
Where are you going?

624
01:00:15,582 --> 01:00:17,641
I don't know.

625
01:00:17,684 --> 01:00:18,912
H uh, where have you been?

626
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:19,816
I'm leaving right now.

627
01:00:21,088 --> 01:00:21,816
How?

628
01:00:22,222 --> 01:00:23,587
How?
Inner tube.

629
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:24,989
You're crazy,
you're going to drown.

630
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,727
Listen, do you want
to help me?

631
01:00:27,761 --> 01:00:29,160
Yes, I want to help you.

632
01:00:29,196 --> 01:00:31,187
Then give me all the
money you have on you.

633
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:35,731
You can have
the gold, clothes...

634
01:00:35,769 --> 01:00:37,100
you can sell
it everywhere.

635
01:00:37,137 --> 01:00:39,162
Please, give me all
the money you have on you.

636
01:00:39,206 --> 01:00:40,230
You have money in here?

637
01:00:40,274 --> 01:00:42,743
Give me the money.
Give me the money!

638
01:00:42,744 --> 01:00:43,471
You can take--

639
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:44,534
you can take everything,

640
01:00:44,578 --> 01:00:45,772
You can stay here
if you want.

641
01:00:45,813 --> 01:00:49,749
Reinaldo, I have
some friends

642
01:00:49,783 --> 01:00:50,750
that can solve
this problem.

643
01:00:50,751 --> 01:00:51,877
What kind of friends
do you have?

644
01:00:51,919 --> 01:00:53,443
You know what
kind of friends.

645
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:54,920
Why kind of friends
do you have?

646
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:55,887
Don't go away.

647
01:00:55,923 --> 01:00:58,187
- Reinaldo.
- I'm leaving.

648
01:00:58,225 --> 01:00:59,419
I'm leaving...

649
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,052
I-I'll keep in touch
with you, alright?

650
01:01:01,094 --> 01:01:02,152
Bye.

651
01:03:49,563 --> 01:03:50,996
Reinaldo--

652
01:04:52,826 --> 01:04:54,727
I have to hide
you somewhere,

653
01:04:54,728 --> 01:04:56,787
because we are
surrounded by police.

654
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:34,427
...a photo of you

655
01:05:34,468 --> 01:05:36,493
just in case you forget
what you look like,

656
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:40,102
and last,
"La lliada."

657
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:41,630
"La llíada," Juan,
"La llíada."

658
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:45,068
Here are the pills
you asked for.

659
01:05:45,112 --> 01:05:46,101
What are they?

660
01:05:46,146 --> 01:05:49,513
I don't know,
but they make you happy.

661
01:05:49,549 --> 01:05:52,017
Will they kill me?

662
01:05:52,052 --> 01:05:54,145
I suppose if you
took enough of them.

663
01:06:44,546 --> 01:06:45,126
Hello.

664
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:45,706
Hello.

665
01:06:45,747 --> 01:06:47,840
Can I have two
croquetas, please?

666
01:06:47,882 --> 01:06:48,849
Two?

667
01:06:48,883 --> 01:06:50,009
Yes, and a drink.

668
01:07:27,255 --> 01:07:28,620
Do you have a light?

669
01:07:31,426 --> 01:07:33,485
Yes.
Sure.

670
01:07:34,963 --> 01:07:36,658
Do you have
a cigarette?

671
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:47,906
What is your name?

672
01:07:48,843 --> 01:07:51,073
Adriano Faustino Sotolongo.

673
01:07:53,481 --> 01:07:55,449
When did you get
that name, Reinaldo?

674
01:07:55,483 --> 01:07:58,077
You are Reinaldo Arenas,
aren't you?

675
01:08:08,029 --> 01:08:09,428
Buen trabajo.

676
01:08:11,766 --> 01:08:13,427
Officer: Mira, encontramos
este paquete.

677
01:08:50,171 --> 01:08:51,729
Este es Reinaldo Arenas,

678
01:08:51,773 --> 01:08:53,764
un pájaro que agarramos
ahí en el parque.

679
01:08:57,512 --> 01:08:59,878
Dale! Dale!

680
01:08:59,914 --> 01:09:01,905
Dale, coño!
Dale!

681
01:09:02,984 --> 01:09:04,747
Ya vas a ver
lo que es bueno.

682
01:09:04,786 --> 01:09:07,118
Vas a ver lo que es bueno
ahí adentro.

683
01:09:23,938 --> 01:09:27,465
I arrived at El Morro not
as a political prisoner

684
01:09:27,509 --> 01:09:28,669
or writer,

685
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:32,612
but with an infamous
reputation as a rapist,

686
01:09:32,647 --> 01:09:35,377
a murderer,
and a CIA agent.

687
01:09:41,489 --> 01:09:43,423
a supernatural air
of nonchalance

688
01:09:43,458 --> 01:09:46,552
and gave me an aura
of danger and respectability

689
01:09:46,594 --> 01:09:49,028
among the real murderers,

690
01:09:49,097 --> 01:09:50,655
real rapists,

691
01:09:50,698 --> 01:09:52,901
and common criminals
who would kill each other

692
01:09:52,902 --> 01:09:54,266
for the slightest reason.

693
01:10:14,489 --> 01:10:17,583
Skies lit by bolts
of lightning

694
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:19,718
were replaced
by electric lights

695
01:10:19,761 --> 01:10:22,491
that blinked on and off
with regularity,

696
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:25,761
killing the possibility
or chance that I might dream

697
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,427
or forget where I was.

698
01:10:29,404 --> 01:10:31,565
I thought here
I could go unnoticed.

699
01:10:31,606 --> 01:10:35,372
But prisoners are those
beings that know everything,

700
01:10:35,410 --> 01:10:37,708
especially about
other prisoners.

701
01:10:49,324 --> 01:10:52,054
Soon they knew,
maybe from the guards,

702
01:10:52,093 --> 01:10:55,392
or the warden himself,
or a killer named Torre,

703
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:56,920
that I was a writer.

704
01:10:56,965 --> 01:11:00,833
Say, you think you could
write a letter for me?

705
01:11:00,868 --> 01:11:02,096
What?

706
01:11:02,170 --> 01:11:03,296
Not for nothing,

707
01:11:04,405 --> 01:11:06,396
I give you two cigarettes.

708
01:11:06,874 --> 01:11:08,102
Carlota--

709
01:11:08,176 --> 01:11:12,545
tell her that I miss
her so much.

710
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:14,207
Your words or mine?

711
01:11:16,618 --> 01:11:19,052
I'm sorry.

712
01:11:29,897 --> 01:11:33,298
My fame as "The Writer"
spread all over the prison.

713
01:11:34,569 --> 01:11:35,627
María...

714
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:39,265
From the 17 cells of El Morro,

715
01:11:39,307 --> 01:11:42,140
and for those who couldn't
see me directly,

716
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:45,668
petitions came in the form
of hundreds of balls of soap,

717
01:11:45,713 --> 01:11:47,442
tied to long strings,

718
01:11:47,482 --> 01:11:50,246
that the prisoners
could pass on to my cell.

719
01:11:51,052 --> 01:11:52,713
It was called "The Mail."

720
01:11:54,122 --> 01:11:55,919
I never wrote so much.

721
01:11:57,325 --> 01:12:00,590
I accumulated a small
fortune of cigarettes

722
01:12:00,628 --> 01:12:03,620
that provided me with
enough paper and pencils

723
01:12:03,665 --> 01:12:05,155
for my own novel,

724
01:12:05,233 --> 01:12:06,757
which I wrote in the middle,

725
01:12:06,801 --> 01:12:09,531
of all the screaming
and crying.

726
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:13,301
Cubans are defined by noise,
it's their nature.

727
01:12:13,341 --> 01:12:15,605
They need to bother others.

728
01:12:15,643 --> 01:12:18,908
They can neither enjoy,
nor suffer in silence.
