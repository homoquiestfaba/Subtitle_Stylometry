and questions"?

may I have your attention?

It gives me great pleasure
to introduce

195
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:39,057
our first after-dinner speech
of the residency.

196
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:41,994

the artistic pursuit

197

of alimentary
and culinary salvation

00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:46,900

public performance,

199
00:13:46,935 --> 00:13:50,398

offers more relaxed,

convivial surroundings

our investigation

into an array
of interculinary disciplines

203
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:01,607
and experiment with anecdotes,
or just simple ideas

204
00:14:01,642 --> 00:14:05,380
that maybe wouldn't work
on a less intimate canvas.

00:14:05,415 --> 00:14:07,349
Elle di Elle's speech,
she tells me, will...

206
00:14:07,384 --> 00:14:08,922
ELLE: "Speech" is maybe

207
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:13,025
too reductive a term
for what I'm about to do.

208
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,127
For what I will read
is found text and it comes

209
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:20,494
from an old house-making manual
that belonged to my mother.

210
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:22,265
"Edna May's Supper School."

211
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:28,403
"Lively recipes and fun tips
to preserve your man's love."

212
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:31,945
As a child, I wanted to be
the model housewife

213
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,540
and this book was my bible

214
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:36,576
until I began to question
what I was reading.

215
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:39,612
I once saw my mother wipe away
a tear in the kitchen,

216
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:41,614
and she tried to pretend
it was the onions,

217
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:44,584
but I could see how tired
she was compared to my father,

218
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:47,026
who was often pretending
to work upstairs,

219
00:14:47,061 --> 00:14:51,162
but just masturbating
to the Tennis Ladies' Annual.

220
00:14:51,197 --> 00:14:53,428
Edna May was
what every woman knew

221
00:14:53,463 --> 00:14:55,969
their spouses wanted them to be.

222
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:58,565
However, it wasn't clear
if that woman on the cover

223
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,468
was this mythical Edna May

224
00:15:00,503 --> 00:15:03,240
or even if there ever
was an Edna May,

225
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:04,978
since the perspective
in the book

226
00:15:05,013 --> 00:15:08,113
was very much in favor
of a man's comfort,

227
00:15:08,148 --> 00:15:11,248
which made me question
who wrote it.

228
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:17,023
And what if this Edna May
genuinely enjoyed cooking?

229
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:19,322
Does that look like
a real smile to you?

230
00:15:19,357 --> 00:15:22,127
Personally, I think you're
reading too much into it.

231
00:15:22,162 --> 00:15:24,723
Maybe that's her subtle way of
subverting those patriarchal

232
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,297
commandments in the book.

233
00:15:27,332 --> 00:15:28,430
A chink in her smile.

234
00:15:28,465 --> 00:15:29,695
That's not a chink.

235
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:32,269
That's a genuine,
heartfelt smile.

236
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:34,568
You're merely projecting
your own resentful ideology

237
00:15:34,603 --> 00:15:36,438
onto the poor woman's face.

238
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:38,143
Just as thousands
of men projected

239
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:40,112

and selfish ideology

00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,773
onto that poor woman's face,

241
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:45,744
trying to turn their wives
into an Edna May.

242
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:50,386
Generations of us were led to
believe by these men, Dr. Glock,

243
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:53,092
that our role was only
in the kitchen.

244
00:15:53,127 --> 00:15:54,423

245

See, just by that comment,

247
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:01,298
you imply that it's only
a woman's job to do such tasks.

248
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,070
I suppose you never read
about the Minoans?

249
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:06,204
So I should
put a sock in my mouth

250
00:16:06,239 --> 00:16:08,371
just because they tried it
the matriarchal way

251
00:16:08,406 --> 00:16:10,142

252
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:12,474
Both of my parents cooked
and they never counted who...

not a debate!

whether it was written
by a woman or a man,

and, if by a woman,

260
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:30,690
was that something
she really believed in?

attractive when serving food

Nonsense, that's his job.

545
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,730
- Youngster!
- No.

546
00:33:18,765 --> 00:33:21,601
- You deal with it.
- Why don't we all deal with it?

547
00:33:21,636 --> 00:33:25,077
Let's find something
and clean this up.

548
00:33:25,112 --> 00:33:26,606
BILLY: I'll get a mop.

549
00:33:29,413 --> 00:33:30,676
Are you okay?

550
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:32,117
I don't feel good.

551
00:33:32,152 --> 00:33:34,614
It'll take all night
to clear this.

552
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:36,385
Maybe we could find
some other mops

553
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,222
and then it won't take so long.

554
00:33:38,257 --> 00:33:40,224
It's oil. Oil on stairs.

555
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:44,195
A mop alone is not enough.
We need hot water and soap.

556
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,658
A mop is just going to spread...

557
00:33:45,693 --> 00:33:48,694
Okay, okay. I don't need to
hear this any more.

558
00:33:48,729 --> 00:33:50,300
What's wrong?

559
00:33:50,335 --> 00:33:52,104
I feel faint.

560
00:33:52,139 --> 00:33:53,633
Don't listen to her, Stones.

561
00:33:53,668 --> 00:33:55,272
Anything to get out
of a bit of work.

562
00:33:55,307 --> 00:33:57,637
- Look at her, she's...
- Stones!

563
00:33:57,672 --> 00:33:59,639
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.

564
00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:01,641
One of us can take you back.

565
00:34:01,676 --> 00:34:03,280
And what about Billy and me?

566
00:34:03,315 --> 00:34:06,811
If I let go, she will fall.

567
00:34:06,846 --> 00:34:08,813
Welcome to our world.

568
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:12,256
JAN STEVENS: With all the
collectives that come here,

569
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:15,589
my duty is first
and foremost to support

570
00:34:15,624 --> 00:34:18,130
and nurture their vision.

571
00:34:18,165 --> 00:34:20,792
The practicalities of realizing
an idea in front

572
00:34:20,827 --> 00:34:24,796
of an audience can be a shock
to the system.

573
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:27,667
The gulf between the head
and the reality of the stage

574
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:29,240
can be forbidding

575
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,681
and often requires
shepherding by someone

576
00:34:30,705 --> 00:34:32,210
who can lead the way...

577
00:34:32,245 --> 00:34:33,838
ELLE: We are our own
harshest critics,

578
00:34:33,873 --> 00:34:36,412
and we have these discussions
by ourselves.

579
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:37,842
JAN STEVENS: I appreciate that,

580
00:34:37,877 --> 00:34:40,185
but as someone
who is supporting you,

581
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:43,683
I would very much like to be
involved in those conversations.

582
00:34:43,718 --> 00:34:45,685
How?

583
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,325
- By guiding you.
- Hm.

584
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,262
I can see you're independent
and strong-willed,

585
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:54,430
and I can adjust my notes
accordingly.

586
00:34:54,465 --> 00:34:56,201
We don't need notes.

587
00:34:56,236 --> 00:34:57,807
JAN STEVENS: I understand
you don't need notes,

588
00:34:57,831 --> 00:35:00,469
but the Institute's money
is funding this,

589
00:35:00,504 --> 00:35:03,307
and I expect something
in return.

590
00:35:03,342 --> 00:35:05,309
What you get in return is this.

591
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,937
Everything we are doing.

592
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,313
I'm just asking for you
to engage.

593
00:35:09,348 --> 00:35:11,678
Form your own
culinary collective, then.

594
00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:13,581
You go out and do this and see

595
00:35:13,616 --> 00:35:15,913
how you feel when someone else
comes along

596
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,486
and tells you what to do.

597
00:35:17,521 --> 00:35:19,323
And how about
you don't accept my support

598
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:21,457
if you don't like the terms?

599
00:35:21,492 --> 00:35:23,327
This is still your vision.

600
00:35:23,362 --> 00:35:27,397
I'm just asking you
to change a few things.

601
00:35:27,432 --> 00:35:29,432
So, it's your idea of my vision?

602
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:32,336
You don't even
know what the notes are yet.

603
00:35:32,371 --> 00:35:34,338
Maybe they won't be
so unpalatable.

604
00:35:34,373 --> 00:35:36,934
That's not the point.
It's the principle.

605
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:40,839
So, even if you agree
with a note, you won't do it?

606
00:35:40,874 --> 00:35:42,346
Correct.

607
00:35:42,381 --> 00:35:43,820
JAN STEVENS:
I'm not a big note person

608
00:35:43,844 --> 00:35:47,318
compared to my forebears
who have held this role.

609
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,682
I respect the artist,

610
00:35:48,717 --> 00:35:50,618
but if I strongly disagree
with something,

611
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:53,456
I will expect you
to at least engage.

612
00:35:53,491 --> 00:35:54,996
But you said it was
wonderful last night.

613
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,492
JAN STEVENS:
Yes, it was wonderful,

614
00:35:56,527 --> 00:35:59,495
but that doesn't mean
we can't discuss.

615
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,959
I found out what was wrong
with the ring modulator.

616
00:36:01,994 --> 00:36:04,368
JAN STEVENS:
It wasn't the ring modulator.

617
00:36:04,403 --> 00:36:07,833
I'm talking about the first half
when everything was working.

618
00:36:07,868 --> 00:36:12,541
It's your use of a flanger
I want to discuss.

619
00:36:12,576 --> 00:36:13,839
What's a flanger?

620
00:36:13,874 --> 00:36:15,544
JAN STEVENS:
It's an electronic device

621
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:17,612
that mixes two signals
resulting in a phase shift.

622
00:36:17,647 --> 00:36:19,383
You didn't like it?

623
00:36:19,418 --> 00:36:21,330
JAN STEVENS: I think it should
be on a lower setting.

624
00:36:21,354 --> 00:36:22,584
Just fractionally.

625
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:23,948
ELLE: Why?

626
00:36:23,983 --> 00:36:25,587
When you alter the sound
that much,

627
00:36:25,622 --> 00:36:27,985
you lose all connection
to the activity.

628
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,856
But that's the whole point
of what we do.

629
00:36:30,891 --> 00:36:33,628
Why do it if it remains
in the culinary context?

630
00:36:33,663 --> 00:36:36,631
And why do it if it's completely
divorced from it?

631
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:38,798
Then it's just sonic
without the catering.

632
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:41,504
So, you want catering
without the sonic?

633
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:44,837
The best collectives here
stretched the elastic

634
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:47,774
of their culinary sounds
as far as they could,

635
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:49,347
but there was always
a connection

636
00:36:49,382 --> 00:36:51,283
to the source material.

637
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:54,385
A semblance of what the sound
once was.

638
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,683
We can take it out, man.

639
00:36:55,718 --> 00:36:57,850
It only lasted a few seconds,
anyway.

640
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:59,687
No.

641
00:36:59,722 --> 00:37:00,853
Then mix it down?

642
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:03,394
No.

643
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,835
Are you going to
give in that easily?

644
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,463
You hardly notice it either way.

645
00:37:06,498 --> 00:37:08,058
That's not the point.

646
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,500
LAMINA: You didn't even know
what a flanger was a minute ago.

647
00:37:10,535 --> 00:37:11,963
I thought she said badger.

648
00:37:11,998 --> 00:37:14,438
I'm just trying to
protect your vision.

649
00:37:14,473 --> 00:37:16,374
ELLE: Can we discuss this
another time?

650
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:19,872
You're ruining my graphic score
with all this flanger nonsense.

651
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:21,841
If that's the case,

652
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:25,042
stop what you're doing
and engage with us.

653
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:27,484
Come on, Elle.

654
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:29,046
I'm the boss!

655
00:37:33,987 --> 00:37:38,330
STONES: How much say do you
have in the band?

656
00:37:38,365 --> 00:37:39,958
I don't know.

657
00:37:39,993 --> 00:37:41,729
I mean, Elle's the boss.

658
00:37:41,764 --> 00:37:43,731
But she can't do
anything technical.

659
00:37:43,766 --> 00:37:46,536
So, that's down to us.

660
00:37:46,571 --> 00:37:48,868
She says what she likes,
what she doesn't like.

661
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:51,574
But sometimes she doesn't
explain herself very well,

662
00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:54,346
which leads to things
sounding the way they do

663
00:37:54,381 --> 00:37:55,875
because of a misunderstanding.

664
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,482
In fact, I'd say
misunderstanding between us

665
00:37:58,517 --> 00:38:01,353
is probably
the key to our sound.

666
00:38:01,388 --> 00:38:04,752
And what made you want to be
a Sonic Caterer?

667
00:38:04,787 --> 00:38:06,754
I don't know.

668
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:08,822
Something you just fell into?

669
00:38:08,857 --> 00:38:11,891
BILLY: I only really knew
what I didn't want to do.

670
00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:15,026
My parents sent me
to this expensive school

671
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:16,896
to help with my table manners,

672
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:20,537
and it wasn't really a world
that I understood.

673
00:38:20,572 --> 00:38:22,935
I wanted something else.

674
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,102
Like what?

675
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,137
I don't know, like...

676
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:30,646
I liked making things.

677
00:38:30,681 --> 00:38:33,011
I liked soldering things.

678
00:38:33,046 --> 00:38:36,047
I like making noises.

679
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:40,458
It didn't really have much
purpose until Elle came along.

680
00:38:40,493 --> 00:38:42,823
And what was the purpose?

681
00:38:42,858 --> 00:38:44,055
BILLY: She had ambition.

682
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:47,465
She had ideas.

683
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,609
It's like she could
channel something

684
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:52,701
that was aimless in me.

685
00:38:52,736 --> 00:38:54,604
And she just...
She would make things happen.

686
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,740
She had the confidence to do
things one hundred percent-ly.

687
00:38:58,775 --> 00:39:01,842
And she was... she was fun
to be around, you know.

688
00:39:03,945 --> 00:39:06,946
In what way?

689
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:10,081
She would pinch my nipples.

690
00:39:10,116 --> 00:39:14,690
And what happened
when she did that?

691
00:39:14,725 --> 00:39:17,759
I don't know, it felt good.

692
00:39:17,794 --> 00:39:21,697
She would say some exciting
things and I'd, you know, I'd...

693
00:39:21,732 --> 00:39:23,897
I'd fiddle with myself a bit.

694
00:39:23,932 --> 00:39:26,966
We had... We had this game
called The Finger Game

695
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:29,639
where she'd fiddle
with herself too

696
00:39:29,674 --> 00:39:33,610
and then I'd sniff her fingers.

697
00:39:33,645 --> 00:39:35,810
But it was never anything
more than that,

698
00:39:35,845 --> 00:39:39,143
in case it compromised
her artistic integrity.

699
00:39:39,178 --> 00:39:42,784
And what about
your artistic integrity?

700
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:48,592
I don't know, I mean...

701
00:39:48,627 --> 00:39:51,991
we got lots made
during that time.

702
00:39:52,026 --> 00:39:53,960
I suppose we didn't think about
what our behavior

703
00:39:53,995 --> 00:39:55,731
meant until afterwards.

704
00:39:55,766 --> 00:39:58,129
So, it didn't last with Elle?

705
00:39:58,164 --> 00:40:00,571
I mean, we got bored.

706
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,475
I mean, we would, sort of,
frisk out when we were bored,

707
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,236
then we got bored of frisking
when we were bored.

708
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:08,040
So...

709
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:09,910
Was it just the two of you
in the band then?

710
00:40:09,945 --> 00:40:13,012
No. There was this other guy
who was doing electronics,

711
00:40:13,047 --> 00:40:17,885
but they fell out because
of dietary differences.

712
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,689
- Meat?
- Yeah.

713
00:40:19,724 --> 00:40:22,593
I mean, anyone caught eating
meat in our band is dead.

714
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:27,598
DR. GLOCK: And deep breath.

715
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,633
And hold.

716
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:33,670
Good.

717
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:35,639
