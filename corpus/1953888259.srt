   on the turn by Mulholland.

    Let me show you around.

     all at your disposal.

An absolute steal for the price.

14
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:20,906
    But I just want to show     
       you the backyard.

     complement the house.      

20
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:44,463
    I mean, they always want    
      you to pay more when      

21

   Okay, Let's cut the crap.    

26
00:02:57,278 --> 00:03:01,947
     I'm assuming the price     
     is so low because....      

27
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,216
      of some dead person

     home a few years ago.      

30
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,555

          a long time.          

37
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,334
   Then one day, people just    
     seem to lose interest.     

38
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,636
        Now, no one even        
      mentions it anymore.

            >>Sorry             
    That's probably because     

130
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,800
       you couldn't hear        
   me over all that traffic.    

131
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,335
     It's a mess but you'll     
        get used to it.         

132
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,402
             >>Hi,              
         >>I'm Natalie,         

133
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,770
    Ii live two houses down.    

134
00:08:25,772 --> 00:08:26,938
   Welcome to Beverly Hills.    

135
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,373
  Land of the rich and Snobby.  

136
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,408
     >>I am Danielle Myers      

137
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,877
    from San Francisco and -    

138
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,211
  >>Oh! I love San Francisco.   

139
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,880
           >>Oh God,            
             Sorry.             

140
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,581
 >>Daddy only takes the stairs  
      whenever he needs to      

141
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,650
       see? He only eats        
    the really fresh stuff.     

142
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,586
   >>You didn't happen to see   
      any homeless people       

143
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,822
   living in our house before   
       we moved in right?       

144
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:46,625
     >>No,it's been vacant      
       since the murder.        

145
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,693
            >>What ?            

146
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,933
    >>Let's try and find the    
        Halstead house.         

147
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,903
            >>Hello!            
    This is someone's house.    

148
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:00,171
   >>Well I don't know that!    

149
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,640
     >>What are they doing?     

150
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:05,677
          >>Ugh creep           
   >>What was that all about?   

151
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,345
          >>Tourists.           
      I blame them for all      

152
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:08,813
   the traffic in this town.    

153
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,350
 So, you really don't know what 

154
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:14,119
        happened here a         
      couple of years ago?      

155
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,487
           >>Nuh-uh.            

156
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:17,722
     You mean your parents      
       didn't tell you ?        

157
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:20,292
             >>No.              
           >>Oh wow!            

158
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:21,960
      You're gonna want to      
     sit down for this one.     

159
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,573
         >>Is it warm ?         
          >>Yeah, no!           

160
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,107
       I don't think the        
      heaters are working.      

161
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:43,381
   >>Okay, well I'm a weanie    
     so I'm gonna sit here.     

162
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,849
 Well, it looks pretty though.  

163
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,086
     >>So tell me about the     
    night that it happened.     

164
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,589
             Okay.              
    So, the night she died,     

165
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,557
          we actually           
        heard it happen.        

166
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,159
     I mean, we didn't know     
      he was killing her,       

167
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:55,961
      we just thought they      
        were having sex.        

168
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:56,995
        They were always        
          having loud,          

169
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:59,197
        crazy, rough sex        
      out on the balcony.       

170
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,632
       So we just thought       
      there they go again       

171
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:02,133
  but, I was trying to sleep.   

172
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,401
        A girl needs her        
          beauty rest!          

173
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,402
           So I kept            
        bothering daddy,        

174
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,637
         and finally he         
        called the cops.        

175
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:08,106
          But, by then          
        it was too late.        

176
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,941
       He had killed her        
        and he was gone.        

177
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,244
     >>So how did she die?      

178
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:14,379
       >>You know what, I       
      actually heard that       

179
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,281
      he crushed her body       
     with a sledge hammer,      

180
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,482
        cut her up into         
         little pieces,         

181
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:18,750
        stuffed her into        
          the suitcase          

182
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:20,952
        and then buried         
       her in the desert,       

183
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,288
     And he's such a creep.     
       She was pregnant.        

184
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,190
         He killed his          
         unborn child.          

185
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:26,091
       After the murder,        

186
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,993
        the neighborhood        
        was swarmed with        

187
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:27,993
         with paparazzi         
           and press.           

188
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,861
      And they all started      
           calling it           

189
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,429
      "Cold Blood Canyon."      

190
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:33,598
     It's kinda creepy when     
      you think about it,       

191
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,100
      because your parents      
          share taste           

192
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,102
    in house with a psycho.     

193
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,839
       But yeah, welcome        
      to the neighborhood.      

194
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,441
           >> Thanks.           

195
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,210
           Come here!           

196
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,679
    Wanna go on a walk huh?     

197
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,784
           Let's see,           
          dishes here.          

198
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,722
   I always leave it in here.   

199
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,094
  Why does everything in this   
    house keep disappearing?    

200
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:07,932
       >>C'mon hurry up.        

201
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,811
       It's a great dog,        

202
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,480
       what kind is it ?        

203
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,115
       >>It's a shih tzu,       

204
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:25,083
       named it Mai Tai.        

205
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,187
     >>Your parents aren't      
    alcoholics or something?    

206
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,021
        >>Yeah, well...         

207
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,191
       >>Well, tough huh?       

208
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,560
         It's my mom's.         

209
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:36,995
   >>Uh huh, always a friend.   

210
00:11:36,997 --> 00:11:37,829
   >>It's my mom's. I swear.    

211
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:37,829
          >>It's okay.          

212
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:41,266
     I feel like a guy that     
     has a metrosexual side     

213
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:42,600
         is kinda cool.         

214
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:46,004
    >>Well, I did, you know,    
  go with her to pick it out.   

215
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,144
     >>So, you live around      
           here or...           

216
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:53,878
       >>I just moved in.       

217
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,547
       >>You have to give       
         me your number         

218
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,549
   so I can show you around.    

219
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,550
     LA is an awesome place     
            when you            

220
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,751
         know where to          
           go and...            

221
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:01,820
            [Laughs]            

222
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:34,886
             >>Mom!             

223
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,422
   Charles, Charles, you are    
    not going to believe me.    

224
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,757
      I know you are going      
      to think I'm crazy,       

225
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,426
    but there is a ghost or     
     something in my room.      

226
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:41,426
         >>Now, Danny,          

227
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:48,299
        I prefer dad, or        
         Mr. Myers, or          

228
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:49,734
           how about            
         Your Majesty?          

229
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,369
         >>You are not          
          my real dad!          

230
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,303
        >>Please Danni,         

231
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,106
      it would mean a lot       
             to me.             

232
00:12:56,142 --> 00:12:59,677
  I know that by now, you have  
     probably heard rumours     

233
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,847
        about this place        
         being haunted.         

234
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:07,018
    But Danni girl, that's,     
      that's all they are,      

235
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,553
     they are just rumours.     

236
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:09,821
       >>You are not even       
        listening to me.        

237
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:10,855
     There is something....     
           >>Danielle           

238
00:13:10,857 --> 00:13:13,591
            are you             
        trying to start         

239
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:15,627
          a miserable           
         evening here?          

240
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:17,662
  >>You are being a real jerk.  

241
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,231
      >>I'm sorry that you      
      feel so hostile but       

242
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,502
       even if this place       
          was haunted,          

243
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,070
        it will take an         
         awful lot more         

244
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:30,608
       to get us out than       
  some fuc...fricking ghosts.   

245
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,076
         >>That's easy          
        for you to say.         

246
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,746
 Your nailpolish isn't getting  
       thrown everywhere.       

247
00:13:34,748 --> 00:13:37,015
      >>Why don't you come      
     on down to my office?      

248

        [Unintelligible]        

615
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:45,615
    >>When did you find out     
       about the murder?        

616
00:44:45,617 --> 00:44:47,216
    How did the police know     
       it was a suicide?        

617
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,351
        How do you sleep        
           at night?            

618
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:49,352
       >>My friend has no       
     comment, but I'm free.     

619
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:52,221
     You can call my agent.     

620

621
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:02,732
         >>Relax, dude.         

622
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:02,732
         >>Guys, guys!          

623
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:05,568
      >>Let him go, Jeff!       
          Let him go!           

624
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:06,703
   >>Who's your little friend   
             Danni?             

625
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:08,037
       >>Will you please        
    take this inside before     

626
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,573
      the media decides to      
     air it on national TV?     

627
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:12,675
   >>Well it depends on what    
   your relationship is then.   

628
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:14,510
      >>We're just friends      
             Jeff.              

629
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:15,578
     >>Really ? Cause when      
      I asked,he told me,       

630
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,913
          he was your           
           boyfriend.           

631
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:17,947
            >>Right             

632
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,782
      >>Well, I mean we're      
        friends and....         

633
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:21,050
        >>Can we please         
       take this inside,        

634
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:22,885
      two of you now ? Go!      

635
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,923
             Eddy.              
             Stop.              

636
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:33,463
       Can I get anybody        
      something to drink ?      

637
00:45:33,465 --> 00:45:35,798
     >>Just an explanation      
         would be fine          

638
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,567
         >>What are you         
          doing here ?          

639
00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:39,102
       >>We were supposed       
     to meet today to talk      

640
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:40,503
      about the exorcism.       

641
00:45:40,505 --> 00:45:42,338
       >>Are you freaking       
          kidding me ?          

642
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,706
    Seriously, What the hell    
         are you doing          

643
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:44,907
    with this little turd ?     

644
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,509
  >>Jeff, I have been through   
       hell today, okay?        

645
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:48,344
       I don't need your        
        bull right now.         

646
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:49,679
       I just need you to       
         be supportive          

647
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:51,547
         >>I should be          
          supportive ?          

648
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:53,983
       Father Gayman here       
         so that he can         

649
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:55,551
     baptize your genitals.     

650
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:57,487
      >>It's not like that      
           >>Really ?           

651
00:45:57,489 --> 00:45:58,554
        Then how is it ?        

652
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:00,089
       Because, what am I       
      supposed to think ?       

653
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:01,858
        When I come over        
        here to see you         

654
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,060
   and I see this guy saying    
     he is your boyfriend.      

655
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:06,562
   >>It's not like that okay!   
      We're just friends.       

656
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:08,531
    And even if he was, why     
    would it matter to you ?    

657
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:09,899
   You're never around here.    

658
00:46:09,901 --> 00:46:11,000
     You're always hanging      
     out with your buddies.     

659
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:11,000
            >>Yeah!             

660
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:15,538
         >>Nat please.          
         I got it okay!         

661
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:18,040
       >>I want this ass        
          out of here.          

662
00:46:18,042 --> 00:46:20,276
     >>I'm sorry Jeff, but      
   that's not your decision.    

663
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:23,146
        >>I'm gonna go.         

664
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:26,449
    >>No, Eddie stay, we've     
      business to discuss.      

665
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:27,717
        Jeff, apologize.        

666
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:29,552
     >>Are you kidding me ?     

667
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:32,155
    >>You're serious. Screw     
     that. I'm out of here.     

668
00:46:32,157 --> 00:46:33,256
       >>Jeff, come back.       

669
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:36,192
          Jeff, wait.           

670
00:46:37,027 --> 00:46:39,529
       >>Lovebirds, what        
          can you do!           

671
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:48,504
 Jeff, I know that you're going 
    to think that I'm crazy     

672
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:50,072
   but this house is haunted.   

673
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:52,642
     I have seen Stephanie      
    Halstead's ghost, okay ?    

674
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:55,244
           It's real            
       And I need Eddie.        

675
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,514
       He is the only one       
        that believes me        

676
00:46:58,516 --> 00:46:59,882
       and he has offered       
            to help.            

677
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,052
        There is nothing        
      going on, I promise.      

678
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,957
    >>Whatever man, the guy     
     inside, he wants you.      

679
00:47:07,959 --> 00:47:09,826
        >>In a couple of        
   hours, Nat's gonna be gone   

680
00:47:09,828 --> 00:47:11,561
       and Eddie is gonna       
          be gone too.          

681
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:14,697
        I need you to do        
       me a favor, okay?        

682
00:47:14,699 --> 00:47:16,899
      It's my parents last      
       night out of town        

683
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:19,669
     and I just don't want      
      to stay here alone.       

684
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,039
     I need someone here to     
        protect me okay!        

685
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,075
        Will you please         
           come back?           

686
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,116
             Thanks             

687
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,462
     >>Okay, for your sake,     
     i hope that was water.     

688
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:48,965
     >>What if she tries to     
       possess us Eddy ?        

689
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:50,032
     >>It's very difficult.     

690
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,668
    For a spirit to actually    
       take over a body,        

691
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,270
    okay, based on what I've    
    read, it takes a lot of     

692
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:56,939
   energy from a spirit, they   
      don't normally have.      

693
00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:59,375
    >>I don't think you know    
   what you're talking about.   

694
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:01,744
    >>A ghost has to want to    
       enter you and you        

695
00:48:01,746 --> 00:48:03,880
      usually have to want      
        it to enter you.        

696
00:48:03,882 --> 00:48:04,814
      Okay, then the ghost      
       has to figure out        

697
00:48:04,816 --> 00:48:05,982
          how to live           
         inside of you.         

698
00:48:05,984 --> 00:48:07,316
    And your spirit, you're     
      gonna have to leave       

699
00:48:07,318 --> 00:48:08,985
       or be forced out.        

700
00:48:08,987 --> 00:48:11,387
  >>I think it's a lot easier   
     than you think it is.      

701
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,590
     >>Even Mother Theresa      
  underwent an exorcism, back   

702
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:16,626
          in Calcutta,          
         back in 2001.          

703
00:48:16,628 --> 00:48:18,461
       Ghosts want their        
          lives back.           

704
00:48:18,463 --> 00:48:20,396
      Okay, but if they're      
          left behind,          

705
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:21,364
       it's for a reason.       

706
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:22,665
      They're on a mission      
          to recapture          

707
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,567
 something that was once lost.  

708
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:26,435
      I mean, it could be       
           permanent.           

709
00:48:26,437 --> 00:48:29,171
    >>Is all this rigamorole    
       really necessary?        

710
00:48:29,173 --> 00:48:31,607
      I have a wedding to       
    get ready for tomorrow?     

711
00:48:31,609 --> 00:48:34,310
  >>Do not let a spirit inside  
      of you voluntarily.       

712
00:48:34,312 --> 00:48:35,578
        It won't leave.         

713
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:39,849
   >>Okay, someone had a bowl   
    of cuckoo for breakfast.    

714
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:41,384
    >>I think we should just    
        get on with it.         

715
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,520
   >>Then we just gotta burn    
     the incense and circle     

716
00:48:44,522 --> 00:48:45,955
        around the guest        
        house six times.        

717
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:48,291
        >>Great! Just in        
        time for dinner.        

718
00:48:48,293 --> 00:48:50,693
         And that's it?         
            >>Yeah.             

719
00:48:50,695 --> 00:48:52,929
        >>And how do we         
       know if it worked?       

720
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:55,498
       >>When junk stops        
         flying around,         

721
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,799
         you're golden.         

722
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:03,572
      Just so you know, if      
      you get bored later,      

723
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:04,674
          let me know.          

724
00:49:04,676 --> 00:49:06,309
        I may be around.        

725
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:08,477
    >>Alright, thanks Eddie.    

726
00:49:08,479 --> 00:49:10,680
     >>Ohh hello, I'll talk     
         to you later.          

727
00:49:10,682 --> 00:49:11,781
          >>Bye, Nat.           

728
00:49:11,783 --> 00:49:13,883
       >>Oh, don't forget       
           your ABCs.           

729
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,686
            >>What?             
    >>Always bring condoms.     

730
00:49:16,688 --> 00:49:19,188
    Go home you dirty slut.     

731
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:21,190
       Natalie, go home.        

732
00:49:21,192 --> 00:49:22,291
             >>Bye!             

733
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,711
     Is that another yawn ?     

734
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:46,983
   >>No, stretching the jaw!    

735
00:49:47,584 --> 00:49:48,884
    >>I'm sorry to bore you.    

736
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,234
        I hope that's a         
         water balloon.         

737
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:09,939
     >>Kind of...sort of..      
            >>Yeah!             

738
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:12,208
      Jeff can we kind of       
       just take it slow?       

739
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:14,210
            [Sighs]             

740
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,879
      >>Any other orders,       
           Mussolini?           

741
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:19,181
           >>Behave.            

742
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:21,817
       >>I am, that's the       
            problem.            

743
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:51,313
            Oh shit!            
            >>What ?            

744
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:53,482
     >>I just saw a woman.      

745
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:55,251
            >>O God!            
            A ghost!            

746
00:50:55,253 --> 00:50:56,519
      >>Oh it didn't work.      

747
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:57,353
          I know Jeff!          

748
00:50:57,355 --> 00:50:59,955
     Now do you know why I      
       have been so eager       

749
00:50:59,957 --> 00:51:02,658
     to have you come over      
     here and protect me ?      

750
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,727
    >>Why don't you call the    
     cops or do something ?     

751
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:06,162
        Why are you just        
      sitting there for ?       

752
00:51:06,164 --> 00:51:07,797
     >>I have been sitting      
     here for so long now.      

753
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:09,832
    >>I gotta go. I mean, I     
     have got something to      

754
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:10,833
     take care of at home.      

755
00:51:10,835 --> 00:51:13,469
        >>Fine, go ahead        
          and go Jeff.          

756
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:21,243
       Are you happy huh?       

757
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:25,047
         God, just get          
        out of my life.         

758
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:27,149
     What does it take for      
    you to leave me alone ?     

759
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:42,498
          Hey Jan, hi           
     um... it's me, Danni.      

760
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:46,368
     Yeah, I was wondering      
    if I could stay with you    

761
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:47,436
        guys for awhile.        

762
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:51,474
  No, hey can um can you guys   
 pick me up at the bus station? 

763
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:57,580
     Okay, okay thank you.      

764
00:51:57,582 --> 00:51:58,414
        I love you too.         

765
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:01,417
  I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.   

766
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,131
    Hey Charles, what is it     
      that you are hiding       

767
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:50,633
     from me in here huh ?      
              Huh?              

768
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:55,838
       Why don't you let        
          me in here ?          

769
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,474
  There's nothing in here that  
     you should be hiding.      

770
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:12,254
        What the hell do        
       you want from me ?       

771
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:13,956
     My mom already thinks      
        that I'm crazy.         

772
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:14,890
         You terrified          
         my boyfriend.          

773
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:16,592
         You know what,         
          I hate you!           

774
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:20,996
      What, now you don't       
       want to play huh ?       

775
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:24,366
             Huh ?              

776
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:43,852
 >>August 4th, my relationship  
         with Stephanie         

777
00:53:43,854 --> 00:53:45,854
      has pulled me out of      
      my depressive state.      

778
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,223
     I have decided to tell     
     her about the journey      

779
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,425
         I have made in         
      reaching the occult.      

780
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,664
  I have become obsessed with   
  finding a way to cheat death  

781
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,766
  and if necessary, Stephanie   
  may have to be my guinea pig  

782
00:53:57,768 --> 00:54:00,135
 to test out some of the things 
   that I've already learned.   

783
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,905
    >>Dude, you gotta clear     
         your chakras.          

784
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:04,340
      Feel the vibrations.      

785
00:54:04,342 --> 00:54:07,209
 September 5th, we had another  
    satanist that's part of     

786
00:54:07,211 --> 00:54:09,878
   my ongoing experimentation   
   in contacting the dead to    

787
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,981
   achieve life everlasting.    

788
00:54:11,983 --> 00:54:14,383
   Steph seems to be getting    
    into it as much as I am.    

789
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:16,252
      It's good to have a       
       partner in crime.        

790
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,622
      Unfortunately, we've      
    had to go through a lot     

791
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:22,258
    of con artists before we    
were able to find the real deal,

792
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,193
   spending millions on a lot   
       of this nonsense,        

793
00:54:24,195 --> 00:54:25,928
      hoping it would pay       
      off in the long run.      

794
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:26,996
  >>Your future is in danger.   

795
00:54:26,998 --> 00:54:29,064
     Prepare to the worst.      

796
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,334
           I mean it.           

797
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,136
       [Foreign language]       

798
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,708
       A dark, dark love.       

799

800
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:52,621
           >>Stop it!           
      Stop, that's enough!      

801
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:52,621
            >>Evil.             

802
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:56,392
     >>No, I said stop it!      
         That's enough!         

803
00:54:58,328 --> 00:54:59,461
         That's enough!         

804
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,174
    >>I gotta stop calling.     

805
00:55:12,176 --> 00:55:14,410
      I get scared of Mom.      

806
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:16,412
     Wh-What are you doing?     

807
00:55:16,414 --> 00:55:19,181
   >>You were snooping around   
in the guest house weren't you? 

808
00:55:19,183 --> 00:55:21,050
     >>No, I - why are you      
          on my case?           

809
00:55:21,052 --> 00:55:22,685
       >>Don't lie to me.       

810
00:55:22,687 --> 00:55:24,053
       Why did you go in        
           there huh?           

811
00:55:24,055 --> 00:55:25,421
   What were you looking for?   
            Money ?             

812
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:28,290
>>I wasn't looking for anything 
    mom. I was just curious.    

813
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:30,693
 >>And didn't Charles tell you  
      not to go in there ?      

814
00:55:30,695 --> 00:55:31,627
      >>Yes,I'm sorry....       

815
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:32,594
    >>Its not your property.    

816

      >>He doesn't go into      
      your room and start

        snooping through        
          your things.          

818
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,666
       And your Aunt Jan        
     called and said I gave     

819
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,401
       you permission to        
        go and see her.         

820
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:41,303
       So is there anyone       
         in this family         

821
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:43,305
   that you are not lying to?   

822
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,876
        Your stepfather         
       and I had a talk.        

823
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:48,744
        School starts in        
           two weeks            

824
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,180
      and you are going to      
   spend your senior year at    

825
00:55:51,182 --> 00:55:53,782
    the Cedar Canyon Academy    
           for Girls.           

826
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:54,616
      >>Mom, no please...       

827
00:55:54,618 --> 00:55:55,617
        >>That's final.         

828

      ship me off because       

829

     Charles tells you to.      

830
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:02,558
     >>No, this is between      
          you and me.           

831
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,727
    Now promise me that you     
   will not go through things   

832
00:56:04,729 --> 00:56:06,161
       that don't belong        
         to you again.          

833
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:07,062
      >>Yes, Mom I swear.       

834
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:08,397
       Just please don't        
          make me go!           

835

 >>I want you in your room for  
    the rest of the evening.

    >>I want my phone back.

  several trips to New Mexico,  

838
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:25,414
  we were unable to find a old  
 Indian shaman, Running Knife,  

839
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:28,584
   who claims he knows how to   
   separate man from spirit.    

840
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,554
      We tripped on peyote      
     and ate the hearts of      

841
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:33,722
       freshly killed cat       

842

death to guide us in our quest.

849
