1
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:14,616
Get up, Brooke. Let's go.

2
00:01:15,187 --> 00:01:17,009
Five more minutes.

3
00:01:31,645 --> 00:01:32,995
Where's my headband?

4
00:01:35,214 --> 00:01:36,512
I knew I lost it.

5
00:01:41,052 --> 00:01:42,541
You'll be great.

6
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:48,581
How not to carry a snack
in a box any more?

7
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,113
I guess that's good for school.

8
00:01:51,213 --> 00:01:53,129
And they opened a cafe across
the street from the school,

9
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:54,882
then the kids could leave n
sheep for a snack there.

10
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:55,982
I like that.

11
00:01:55,984 --> 00:01:57,267
- Really?
- Terrible.

12
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,770
It's not a dog food. I would never
let your sister eat dog food.

13
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:02,189
How handsome you are, Mum.

14
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:05,574
I'm nervous about my first day
of class, and you're not?

15
00:02:05,772 --> 00:02:07,114
We did not.

16
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:08,855
If you were my professor, I would

17
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:10,914
fall in love with
you in two seconds.

18
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,735
Hurry up. In five
minutes, let's go.

19
00:02:13,738 --> 00:02:14,738
Good.

20
00:02:15,237 --> 00:02:16,767
What are you going
to school like this?

21
00:02:16,795 --> 00:02:17,795
Nothing will happen.

22
00:02:17,796 --> 00:02:19,406
Honey, I want you to wait
for them at 3pm, okay?

23
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,606
I know, Jean

24
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:22,476
And you. Kysten, check
the bus schedule.

25
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,434
Look, I have something
quick to do at work,

26
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:27,071
if you need anything, let him
call me home, okay? Good.

27
00:02:27,072 --> 00:02:28,092
Nothing will happen.

28
00:02:28,095 --> 00:02:30,217
- May I leave in peace?
- Everything is under control.

29
00:02:30,249 --> 00:02:32,605
Go.

30
00:02:34,126 --> 00:02:37,127
- Where's my raft?
- On the counter.

31
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,630
Thank you. I knew
it was there. Good?

32
00:02:44,427 --> 00:02:46,484
Brooke, Brooke, don't
get separated.

33
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:47,170
Good.

34
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:49,158
I want you to remember
everything that

35
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:51,095
happens today, so
to tell me tonight.

36
00:02:51,096 --> 00:02:52,654
- You can.
- But without making up, okay?

37
00:02:52,657 --> 00:02:54,708
Can. Goodbye, Mum., We
love you. You love us too.

38
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:58,282
I love you both. Kisses.
Hi. My beauties.

39
00:02:58,285 --> 00:02:59,636
You too, Mum.

40
00:03:00,728 --> 00:03:03,651
Will we be so crazy when we are
mothers like her? No way.

41
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:10,504
Black and white.
Colouring, colouring. Two

42
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:14,725
o'clock. Yes, collage.
Pink, orange, just that.

43
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:18,941
Yes, listen. Get on
bus number 4, I'll wait

44
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:21,672
for you where we agreed.
Number 4, okay?

45
00:03:21,872 --> 00:03:24,213
Please, my brain is
capable of getting

46
00:03:24,214 --> 00:03:26,316
out of nothing, and I'll expose it

47
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:28,634
bus secrets number 4.

48
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:42,148
Good morning.

49
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,352
- Hi, I'm Brooke.
- Ah hi, I'm Deny. How are you?

50
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:56,779
- I'm fine, Deny.
- Do you like your teacher?

51
00:03:56,782 --> 00:03:58,883
- Yeah, not bad.
- Napkins.

52
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:00,081
Napkins.

53
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:05,411
They gave me the wrong
combination or something.

54
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,248
You allow it?

55
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:08,257
- Yeah, whatever you want.
- Let's see.

56
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:16,435
26, good. 24, here it is. That.

57
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:23,244
- Take the money and run.
- You can. Thank you. Take it.

58
00:04:23,444 --> 00:04:25,069
Thank you. Worth it.

59
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:27,541
Brooke, we're going to our house.

60
00:04:27,542 --> 00:04:29,944
Yeah, we'll be late for the bus.

61
00:04:29,945 --> 00:04:31,840
Okay, come on. Goodbye.

62
00:04:38,929 --> 00:04:40,134
Kids, wait.

63
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,915
You can go like this, but you have
to get home by 6pm, okay? Clear.

64
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:50,115
What did I say?

65
00:04:50,563 --> 00:04:53,133
At home at 6 pm.
Yes. Be good. Goodbye.

66
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:55,307
All right, let's go meet
Brooke at the bus stop.

67
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,310
- Can.
- Goodbye.

68
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:59,768
- Is the medium good?
- Yes, medium is great.

69
00:05:01,858 --> 00:05:04,546
Hi., Hi, how was Jean's
first day at school?

70
00:05:04,549 --> 00:05:07,351
She hasn't arrived home
yet, but she will soon.

71
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:08,568
Great.

72
00:05:12,673 --> 00:05:16,765
- Isn't that...?
- I told her to take that bus.

73
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:19,613
- Weird. I guess he missed her.

74
00:05:19,914 --> 00:05:21,276
I'm going to pick her up.

75
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:24,254
Mr Ellioson. Brooke was
wounded in Nicols Routs Street.

76
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:25,721
What?

77
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,075
Lies Wounded in
Nicols Routs Street.

78
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:31,546
What? What? She
says Brooke is lying

79
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:33,399
wounded in Nicols Routs Street.

80
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,920
- Can you take us there?
- Yikes. Of course. Let's go.

81
00:05:39,293 --> 00:05:41,019
Why did she go down
Nicols Routs Street?

82
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:44,307
Makes no sense.

83
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:49,239
For God's sake.

84
00:05:51,793 --> 00:05:52,793
Oh no.

85
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:02,639
Stay in the car.
Don't get out of it.

86
00:06:13,447 --> 00:06:17,178
One, two, three, four,
five, carefully, six...

87
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:19,639
- Brooke.
- Seven, eight...

88
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,033
She's my daughter. Brooke.
Stabilises her neck. Brooke.

89
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:45,014
Ready for transport. One, two,
three, carefully, carefully

90
00:06:45,214 --> 00:06:50,934
Guys, follow me, guys.
Let's go, one, two and three.

91
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:53,088
Where are you taking her?
To an international hospital.

92
00:06:56,872 --> 00:07:00,262
An accident, an 11-year-old girl.
She had

93
00:07:00,263 --> 00:07:03,412
tachycardia so we
had to intubate her.

94
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:05,144
Pressure: 90/60. We
were able to reimagine

95
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:06,434
it. Heart rate: 120 per minute.

96
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,101
There were inhalations
and exhalations

97
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:09,118
at the pump of a thousand.

98
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,222
Ready to transport?

99
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:13,157
Just be quiet. One, two and three.

100
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,974
What is it? Tell us.

101
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,752
I can only say what
we know for now...

102
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:32,108
which is that he has a major neck

103
00:07:32,109 --> 00:07:34,855
fracture, broken hands
and a concussion.

104
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:38,915
The only thing we can do
is wait for him to wake up.

105
00:07:39,512 --> 00:07:40,953
Disabled, how do you know?

106
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:44,696
The accident left large marks
on the brain and cervical spine.

107
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,069
Love, breathe and calm down.

108
00:07:47,631 --> 00:07:50,547
I'll present you an
operational plan.

109
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:53,157
It will be a difficult operation.

110
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:57,605
She's still alive. And
as long as she is alive,

111
00:07:57,606 --> 00:08:00,961
there is hope, but be
prepared for the worst.

112
00:08:14,683 --> 00:08:15,683
There it is.

113
00:08:58,987 --> 00:09:00,853
The night will pass quickly.

114
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:04,035
Grandma, when will we
be able to see Brooke?

115
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:05,186
I do not know.

116
00:09:22,247 --> 00:09:26,077
Stupid, stupid, why can't you ever

117
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:30,247
do what you're told?
Stupid Brooke.

118
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,337
The longer your daughter
is in a coma, the

119
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:38,628
less chance she will
have of becoming aware.

120
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:43,026
We'll give her another 36 hours
so she can regain consciousness.

121
00:09:43,226 --> 00:09:48,862
Doctor, and if... and when he
wakes up from whom, what happens?

122
00:09:49,062 --> 00:09:52,932
We have to take into
account that when it comes

123
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:56,804
to consciousness, it will
not recognise anyone.

124
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:09,572
Your friends made this great
poster and everyone signed it.

125
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:13,390
And you have another
gift, sweetheart...

126
00:10:13,983 --> 00:10:19,091
new teddy bear.
Look how cute he is.

127
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:22,736
You will be here to see
him when you get better.

128
00:10:55,915 --> 00:11:00,664
- U s t a n I Brooke.
- Brooke.

129
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,036
Brooke, do you dream?

130
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,672
- Brooke, are you nervous?
- No, I'm very happy.

131
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:21,058
Watch out., Let me
go, my head hurts.

132
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:25,677
- You tell me in the evening,
but without making up, okay?

133
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:32,205
- Brooke, get up, Brooke.
- Kids, wait.

134
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:41,378
Get up, Brooke. Get up Brooke.
Usttaannniiiii Brooke. Stand up.

135
00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:31,745
Brooke.

136
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:35,736
Do you know where you are?

137
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:39,954
- Brooke, Brooke, come back.
- Brooke, Brooke.

138
00:12:41,217 --> 00:12:47,060
I'm your mum. Brooke. Brooke. Hey.
Brooke. Do you know who I am?

139
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:49,219
- Do you know who I am?

140
00:12:54,443 --> 00:12:59,946
Blink
once for days and twice for no.

141
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:07,118
Yes, exactly.

142
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:12,196
Brooke, do you know what happened?

143
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:21,307
Calm down. We assume it's an
accident. You're in the hospital.

144
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:24,271
Everyone here is
making you feel better.

145
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,975
I know you have a
thousand questions.

146
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,198
We'll answer anything
when you take

147
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:35,483
out a device that
helps you breathe.

148
00:13:36,497 --> 00:13:38,704
At least we will
try to answer you.

149
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:40,692
Mum and I are here, is that clear?

150
00:13:42,753 --> 00:13:46,568
- You will be fine.
- Okay. You will be fine.

151
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:51,791
Good girl.

152
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:57,137
Probably the car hit his feet.
And what

153
00:13:57,138 --> 00:14:01,087
will be the consequences
for the legs?

154
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:03,541
I don't mean to amputate her legs.
He is

155
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,697
already paralysed
from the neck onwards.

156
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,525
Excuse me... can I
talk to you out there?

157
00:14:11,528 --> 00:14:15,281
- Of course. Of course.
- Honey, I'll be quick.

158
00:14:17,865 --> 00:14:18,923
And I'll talk to you.

159
00:14:26,272 --> 00:14:28,745
No one knows that my daughter
will remain paralysed.

160
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,083
And I forbid you to speak
about it before her...

161
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:35,174
and if you ruin her
positive attitude, you

162
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:38,195
won't stay in this
hospital, are we okay?

163
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:54,511
Hey Brookie, here I am.

164
00:15:01,197 --> 00:15:02,515
Do you know this thing is getting

165
00:15:02,516 --> 00:15:03,995
out of your mouth
tomorrow morning?

166
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:07,529
Yes, from the mouth.
You will be able to speak again.

167
00:15:11,812 --> 00:15:13,771
Does it hurt? Are you ok?

168
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:19,186
The hospital is here to remove
your pain little by little.

169
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:21,490
- Nothing hurts her, baby.
- It's good.

170
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:26,935
At school, everyone asks about

171
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:29,810
you... I'll tell them you're okay.

172
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,137
I love you.

173
00:15:57,918 --> 00:15:59,805
Emergency intervention was good.

174
00:16:00,216 --> 00:16:03,630
Now that we have located the
problem, we can stabilise the neck

175
00:16:04,218 --> 00:16:07,283
and send her to rehab.

176
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:13,106
- But it's only been six weeks.
- She's not... yet.

177
00:16:13,642 --> 00:16:16,059
We have done everything
in our power...

178
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,432
- Wake up.
- Hi.

179
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:28,090
Hi honey.

180
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:31,660
Brooke can open his
mouth, but he can't talk.

181
00:16:31,661 --> 00:16:33,918
But it can shape words by word of

182
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:36,655
mouth, that's the best part.
Hi lives.

183
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:44,855
Do you think... can... they can...
go back... to school?

184
00:17:00,022 --> 00:17:01,709
Can you go back to school?

185
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:08,051
Do we mean to go back to
school, do you ask us that?

186
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:11,112
- Not.
- Not.

187
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:14,312
- We don't think you
will go back to school,

188
00:17:14,313 --> 00:17:16,295
than we guarantee you.

189
00:17:16,323 --> 00:17:21,213
- Don't worry about it.
- You promise me? We promise you.

190
00:17:27,044 --> 00:17:28,875
I promise you.

191
00:17:36,048 --> 00:17:37,048
Sorry.

192
00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:40,512
Watch your mum.

193
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,496
You might be a little
scared of the new

194
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,267
environment... you
may also be sad.

195
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:52,180
So I brought you just in
case a lemon-flavoured

196
00:17:52,181 --> 00:17:55,035
candy, I'll put it in your pocket.

197
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:56,631
But don't eat them all right away.

198
00:17:58,933 --> 00:17:59,933
Goodbye honey.

199
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:04,375
I love you.

200
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:07,693
- Time to go, Mr Ellison.
- Alright.

201
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,635
I love you too, Dad.

202
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:26,285
All right, follow
Route 49 and Route 47.

203
00:18:26,286 --> 00:18:29,224
I'll drive behind the ambulance.

204
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:31,748
I know, but if by any
chance you break away from

205
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:33,675
the vehicle and you don't
see the rotating lights.

206
00:18:33,676 --> 00:18:37,278
My vehicle won't run away.
I know, I know. Kysten...

207
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:40,472
there are tickets at
3:30 pm on Mondays and

208
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:42,334
- Fridays.
- Jean, I'll give you some money.

209
00:18:43,282 --> 00:18:44,282
Yes, it can. Thank you.

210
00:18:44,284 --> 00:18:45,935
- If you need something,
you can buy it., Alright.

211
00:18:45,936 --> 00:18:52,213
And Reed... has to
be in bed by 9pm, okay?

212
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:55,721
Love, I know.

213
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,527
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

214
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,786
- Try to guard yourself.
- I will, come on.

215
00:19:04,787 --> 00:19:08,194
Hey, I'll call you in a while...
You know.

216
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,657
- I love you.
- I love you.

217
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:40,807
Hi, I'm Jean Ellison, I'm
accompanying my daughter Brooke.

218
00:19:40,808 --> 00:19:42,639
Are you here to leave your
daughter to care for us?

219
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,070
I pray?

220
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:46,863
Will you leave your daughter
here to live permanently?

221
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:49,927
We do not know.
We're here for rehab.

222
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:52,220
I'll direct you to your room,

223
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:56,274
the nurse will come quickly.
There.

224
00:19:56,275 --> 00:19:57,643
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

225
00:20:39,422 --> 00:20:41,509
There are many children your age.

226
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:00,394
Hi. Hi.

227
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,745
Okay, thank you.

228
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:27,268
Sorry, did you say something?
Do I have something in my pocket?

229
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:31,980
- No?
- My pocket., Your pocket?

230
00:21:36,598 --> 00:21:38,117
Daddy's candy?

231
00:21:40,803 --> 00:21:43,732
Now you will get one,
and for dessert one.

232
00:21:46,456 --> 00:21:53,641
We'd best find someone to give
us an idea for... landscaping.

233
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:56,835
We didn't meet Dr Brown,

234
00:21:57,471 --> 00:22:00,538
but I found your account
from your $21,000 office.

235
00:22:00,738 --> 00:22:04,157
Yes, I'll wait., Kysten didn't
want to go to school after school.

236
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,298
- Why?

237
00:22:05,303 --> 00:22:06,893
He says he is not feeling well.

238
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,961
She went to bed before dusk.

239
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:10,929
Do you think I should take her
to the doctor in the morning?

240
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:11,871
You don't know...

241
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,349
Second, Mum. Yes, the
account number is: 8230.

242
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:17,092
No temperature, but...
I'm worried.

243
00:22:17,093 --> 00:22:19,115
He's a doctor consultant.

244
00:22:20,906 --> 00:22:27,508
Well, I guess that's Dr Shilds
then? Means that.

245
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:35,268
Okay, do you receive credit
cards? Okay, thank you.

246
00:22:40,614 --> 00:22:42,114
If you're not going to
open your mouth, we're

247
00:22:42,115 --> 00:22:43,681
going to have to force
you, so choose yourself?

248
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:46,416
Hi honey. What is happening?

249
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:49,599
We have a problem, they
won't take medication,

250
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,518
they won't open
their mouth at all.

251
00:22:53,941 --> 00:22:55,356
And what are these drugs?

252
00:22:55,357 --> 00:22:57,506
Style sofender,
vitamin and sedative.

253
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:02,566
- And what is a sedative for?
- Make it easier to fall asleep.

254
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:04,978
- But she's going to
school, she has to be awake.

255
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:09,602
Mrs Ellison, we know the needs
of children with tetraplegia,

256
00:23:09,603 --> 00:23:11,440
and these kids can't
go back to school...

257
00:23:11,441 --> 00:23:12,053
Ah no.

258
00:23:12,054 --> 00:23:14,927
But look they can go to
school with a custom program.

259
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,890
We'll wait and see how it goes.

260
00:23:17,306 --> 00:23:20,369
Leave it on the table, so I'll
make sure he takes his medicine.

261
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:27,014
Thank you.

262
00:23:28,195 --> 00:23:31,818
Good morning.

263
00:23:35,384 --> 00:23:36,657
You have to start learning

264
00:23:39,183 --> 00:23:41,057
that when you get out of here
you can go back to school.

265
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:51,229
That's what we'll do. But first
take the vitamin, open it.

266
00:23:52,512 --> 00:23:53,512
Now the other one,

267
00:23:55,377 --> 00:23:57,697
and let your sister
take her sedative.

268
00:23:59,325 --> 00:24:00,823
And get him in the ass.

269
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:10,781
Oh my God.

270
00:24:15,175 --> 00:24:16,175
Are you new here?

271
00:24:18,645 --> 00:24:19,645
Yes I am.

272
00:24:21,082 --> 00:24:23,116
Where is the injury to your child?
Which vertebra was injured?

273
00:24:25,123 --> 00:24:28,386
The injury is to the neck. C2

274
00:24:30,287 --> 00:24:31,735
Is she on a respirator?

275
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:35,473
For now it is.

276
00:24:37,189 --> 00:24:38,623
My boyfriend was injured
with a vertebra C6.

277
00:24:40,706 --> 00:24:43,273
He can breathe on his own,
but his brain is destroyed.

278
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,278
Sometimes he seems to recognise
me, but I'm not entirely sure.

279
00:24:55,983 --> 00:24:57,145
I am very sorry.

280
00:24:58,373 --> 00:25:00,542
What do you think it will
be when you bring it home?

281
00:25:00,729 --> 00:25:04,942
Not. I can't even bring
him. Let alone nurture it.

282
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:09,381
But thanks to the
drunken and stupid

283
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:12,474
60 year old my son will live with.

284
00:25:13,337 --> 00:25:14,337
And my husband.

285
00:25:16,388 --> 00:25:17,859
I'm not alone in this one.

286
00:25:19,678 --> 00:25:21,853
Many mothers are divorced here.

287
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:24,447
It was not appropriate
for the husbands

288
00:25:24,448 --> 00:25:25,854
to have children
with disabilities.

289
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,252
Hello, sunshine.

290
00:25:46,954 --> 00:25:49,555
And... I'll call you.
It's cheaper if I call you.

291
00:26:07,086 --> 00:26:08,086
Hello.

292
00:26:08,723 --> 00:26:09,723
I'm sorry.

293
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:15,677
We're in a big crowd here, baby.

294
00:26:21,534 --> 00:26:22,534
Jean.

295
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:30,109
Jean.

296
00:26:31,603 --> 00:26:33,753
I can't do this.

297
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,076
This is very difficult.

298
00:26:38,176 --> 00:26:39,251
Jean.

299
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,980
Honey.

300
00:26:46,703 --> 00:26:49,258
I'm sorry.

301
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:59,800
Brooke, here we are.
How is this managed?

302
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:02,210
Where are you. Where are you.
Don't fire.

303
00:28:02,211 --> 00:28:06,174
- Oh my God. Where's that button?
- I'm looking for him. Not here.

304
00:28:06,374 --> 00:28:10,256
Oh, here it is. Oh, he's stuck.
I have it.

305
00:28:16,263 --> 00:28:18,060
Now everything is all right.
Do not Cry.

306
00:28:19,151 --> 00:28:23,135
It could have been worse.
Ssss. We love you.

307
00:28:24,061 --> 00:28:27,585
Everything is fine now. It's over.

308
00:28:30,699 --> 00:28:31,967
Keep sleeping.

309
00:28:57,488 --> 00:28:59,925
Are you done with that thing?

310
00:28:59,928 --> 00:29:04,381
Just not. Ed, you'd like
to stay home tomorrow.

311
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:09,245
But it takes 15 minutes for this.

312
00:29:09,246 --> 00:29:12,884
I'd like you to
take a few days off.

313
00:29:13,243 --> 00:29:16,163
I cannot afford this because the
cost of the hospital is too great.

314
00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:21,353
I know, that's why we'll
give you a paid vacation.

315
00:29:22,046 --> 00:29:25,325
Have a week off.
To go see your daughter.

316
00:29:38,212 --> 00:29:39,212
Thank you.

317
00:29:39,718 --> 00:29:41,834
- Your family comes to see you.
- That.

318
00:29:41,837 --> 00:29:45,010
- How would you like to say
hello to them, with a voice?

319
00:29:46,188 --> 00:29:47,239
What is that?

320
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,326
This is what we use
to start the throat.

321
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:54,394
Yeah., He also helps with vocal
cords so she can talk again.

322
00:29:54,594 --> 00:29:55,649
Do you want to try?

323
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,728
Honey, you wanna try it?

324
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:02,815
- Yes.
- Excellent., He agrees.

325
00:30:03,015 --> 00:30:06,792
I'll inject this into my breathing

326
00:30:06,793 --> 00:30:11,015
apparatus. It's painless.
It's over.

327
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:15,868
- Can you say anything?
- I... feel... weird.

328
00:30:19,844 --> 00:30:22,284
I sure sound stupid, right?

329
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:26,999
Well, it's the most beautiful
voice I've ever heard.

330
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,993
Really great first words.
I was expecting

331
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,131
something like: a small
step for humanity or

332
00:30:31,132 --> 00:30:36,776
How can your country do something
for you? But this, I like it.

333
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:40,495
Hey. Hey. Wait, wait.

334
00:30:41,678 --> 00:30:45,007
Listen to me, you know
Brooke can't move his head,

335
00:30:45,008 --> 00:30:47,366
so speak straight to her and
look straight at the cart.

336
00:30:47,566 --> 00:30:48,879
- You can.
- Hang on.

337
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,835
Her voice may be
strange, but she tries

338
00:30:52,836 --> 00:30:55,960
not to feel bad about it., Can.
Let's go.

339
00:30:56,784 --> 00:30:59,647
Hey., Hey, look who came to us?

340
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,207
Hi... Reed..., How are you?

341
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,851
What's up?

342
00:31:03,852 --> 00:31:07,749
You have a little weird voice,
but don't feel bad for him, okay?

343
00:31:07,784 --> 00:31:10,460
Come and give me a hug., Hi Mum.

344
00:31:10,463 --> 00:31:14,724
- You grew another 3 inches.
- At least three., Look

345
00:31:14,725 --> 00:31:16,157
what I have for you.

346
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,314
My... books.

347
00:31:20,315 --> 00:31:27,155
Maths... and the Red Carriage in
the Wild West. It's a good book.

348
00:31:27,156 --> 00:31:28,422
Excellent.

349
00:31:28,423 --> 00:31:32,223
Why is the piano locked?
Because nobody can steal keys.

350
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:34,858
Because they are easy to steal.

351
00:31:34,914 --> 00:31:39,425
And how is it here?
Hey Reed, let go of that key.

352
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,489
I succeed.

353
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,811
What else have you taught
him since I'm gone?

354
00:31:45,592 --> 00:31:48,245
- Reed.
- What about Kysten?

355
00:31:48,692 --> 00:31:53,761
What? He has a weird look.
It is as if the ball was blown.

356
00:31:55,006 --> 00:31:56,795
Honey, come here.

357
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,149
How are you?

358
00:31:59,787 --> 00:32:01,080
Let your mum give you one half.

359
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:05,306
I believe you're having fun eating
alone. I'm saying it seriously.

360
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,788
Also give me two plates of dessert
for that table over there, please.

361
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,984
Your grandma doesn't cook?

362
00:32:12,823 --> 00:32:14,967
Of course she cooks.
And ingenious.

363
00:32:16,793 --> 00:32:18,985
Don't you like this food
from the hospital canteen?

364
00:32:19,754 --> 00:32:20,923
I haven't tasted it yet.

365
00:32:20,924 --> 00:32:22,859
I also see that
you're not even hungry.

366
00:32:23,438 --> 00:32:26,104
- You just mix it on a plate.
- Am I doing something wrong?

367
00:32:27,608 --> 00:32:29,364
You're not doing anything wrong.

368
00:32:31,128 --> 00:32:33,105
I just want you to eat. Kysten,

369
00:32:33,106 --> 00:32:35,531
you're very thin.
I want you to eat.

370
00:32:35,534 --> 00:32:37,001
- Good.

371
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:43,390
Look at me. I know this is
hard, I know. Just listen to me

372
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:45,174
please do your best to stay
strong and healthy, okay?

373
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:46,175
Deal.

374
00:32:47,564 --> 00:32:49,050
- Yes?
- Okay.

375
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:55,040
You say agreed, and again I don't
see you eating., Mum. Okay.

376
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:00,291
Bobby, please get
me off the respirator.

377
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:02,802
She asks for it every
day with her mother.

378
00:33:03,406 --> 00:33:05,916
I want to show you
how I can breathe.

379
00:33:05,917 --> 00:33:07,172
Okay, let me see.

380
00:33:09,701 --> 00:33:10,925
Okay, I'm ready.

381
00:33:29,402 --> 00:33:31,607
Have you seen? I was
breathing a little.

382
00:33:31,608 --> 00:33:32,608
That's perfect.

383
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:34,952
I'm ready to try again.

384
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:37,504
Get down on the ground, Brooke.
You

385
00:33:37,505 --> 00:33:39,592
cannot breathe
without a respirator.

386
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:43,025
Okay, look, honey.
I have to go get

387
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:45,435
some things done
at the front desk.

388
00:33:45,436 --> 00:33:48,221
- You were fantastic.
- Thank you.

389
00:33:48,421 --> 00:33:51,294
Can you come with me to help me?
Of course.

390
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,800
Listen up., I don't want
to give her false hopes.

391
00:33:57,803 --> 00:33:59,423
- What do you want? Hope is hope.

392
00:33:59,424 --> 00:34:01,708
I don't want you to take
that away from my daughter.

393
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:03,864
Is this hope for Brooke
or for you and your wife?

394
00:34:04,064 --> 00:34:05,806
The family must
understand and accept the

395
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:07,509
fact that your daughter
is a tetraplegic

396
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,934
And that she would
be connected to a

397
00:34:08,935 --> 00:34:10,359
respirator for the
rest of her life.

398
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,749
Does it seem fair to you
that Brooke believes that

399
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,139
when he returns home
everything will be as it was?

400
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,892
Someone will have
to be with her 24/7

401
00:34:17,893 --> 00:34:20,554
because if the respirator goes
off and no one is with her.

402
00:34:20,754 --> 00:34:22,976
It will die in a few
minutes, that's the reality.

403
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,048
You don't know how
this will develop.

404
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:27,380
Look, we're not trying
to change what was,

405
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,632
rather than trying to
teach them to live with it.

406
00:34:31,734 --> 00:34:33,439
I also need a second mortgage to

407
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,413
renovate the house
for my daughter.

408
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:39,531
I can't get a
wheelchair to the door.

409
00:34:40,222 --> 00:34:43,386
The social service will do its
job, it can be any moment.

410
00:34:43,632 --> 00:34:45,225
And only on that condition
can I bring her home.

411
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:53,126
Listen. Ed, I'm so sorry,
but I can't grant you a loan.

412
00:34:58,656 --> 00:34:59,656
Dad.

413
00:34:59,986 --> 00:35:01,192
What that...? Are you ok?

414
00:35:01,195 --> 00:35:03,510
- Hi. Hi. Yes, I'm fine.
- What are you doing?

415
00:35:04,484 --> 00:35:06,210
What's Dad doing? I do not know.

416
00:35:06,213 --> 00:35:08,952
- Reed, do me a favour. Get
a metre from the kitchen.

417
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:11,162
- Is running. Come on.
- Yes.

418
00:35:17,475 --> 00:35:20,013
Dad, what are you doing? It's
my mum's favourite flowers.

419
00:35:20,014 --> 00:35:21,876
I know, honey, but
it'll bother you here.

420
00:35:22,238 --> 00:35:24,822
- What are you saying?
- I'll make a ramp.

421
00:35:25,408 --> 00:35:27,314
Measure the door.
See if it's 16 inches?

422
00:35:27,315 --> 00:35:27,950
You can.

423
00:35:27,951 --> 00:35:30,779
But why? Because she could
pass the cart from Brooke.

424
00:35:30,782 --> 00:35:33,042
- It's exactly 16.
- Oh, really. Come here.

425
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:35,566
And measure this staircase.
Can. Thank you.

426
00:35:35,816 --> 00:35:38,104
It is missing 30 metres
for the ramp that I

427
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:40,290
would walk to the door.
What have we got?

428
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:44,630
- 7.
- Okay. Stand back. Carefully.

429
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,618
Hey.

430
00:36:03,891 --> 00:36:06,936
Do you need a few hands
to remodel your house?

431
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:33,451
Ah... what a victory. You shot
me in the corner., Napkins.

432
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:37,296
Hey, how come you came, Alan?

433
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:39,633
Well I was around
with my motor team

434
00:36:39,634 --> 00:36:41,970
there so I said
take the opportunity

435
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:45,831
I visit this smartwatch.
Ooo. Hi Mr Linski.

436
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,928
Do you have any questions?

437
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:53,045
- What's on the shirt?
- Read it for yourself.

438
00:36:53,243 --> 00:36:55,142
Devils... in hell.

439
00:36:55,143 --> 00:37:00,369
Devils in hell. What did
you hear about the devils?

440
00:37:00,774 --> 00:37:02,783
That they are in hell.

441
00:37:02,784 --> 00:37:07,726
Devils and angels. Are there
really angels in hell too?

442
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:13,073
Yes, if you don't study enough and
don't care about the environment.

443
00:37:13,074 --> 00:37:14,790
The devil will come?

444
00:37:16,227 --> 00:37:20,675
Yes, but luckily you will have
to go through many more periods.

445
00:37:20,676 --> 00:37:22,968
Because of my condition, right?

446
00:37:23,168 --> 00:37:27,011
No, because you're
still little, and

447
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:30,959
to my knowledge,
girls have to learn.

448
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:40,003
But we can do this.
Page 3, Chapter 7.

449
00:37:40,586 --> 00:37:41,830
Let me see if I get it right.

450
00:37:41,831 --> 00:37:45,459
Medically covers the appliance
only if it stays in the hospital,

451
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,655
But not when he gets home.

452
00:37:52,997 --> 00:37:57,322
Okay. Can you send me a sketch?
Yes I can make a copy.

453
00:37:58,183 --> 00:38:04,254
Yes, thank you. May I have your
name, please? Yes, your name.

454
00:38:04,255 --> 00:38:07,149
I prayed to God to give me fear,

455
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:10,801
when that fear becomes
overwhelming, I will tell him

456
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:14,109
to take it off my back
and give me happiness...

457
00:38:14,494 --> 00:38:17,196
If my daughter
prioritises something,

458
00:38:17,197 --> 00:38:19,686
then it's definitely a respirator.

459
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:23,654
But when he gets home, it's gone.

460
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:30,300
That's what you're saying. Yeah.

461
00:38:31,461 --> 00:38:36,435
Thank you for your time.
Tell me your name, please?

462
00:38:36,635 --> 00:38:39,693
Give back what doesn't
belong to you. Loneliness...

463
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:40,997
Until dawn tomorrow.

464
00:38:41,197 --> 00:38:42,538
Do you read her story?

465
00:38:42,539 --> 00:38:46,060
That. Red carriage in the Wild
West. We came to 5 chapters.

466
00:38:46,061 --> 00:38:49,010
Let's get her attention
and change her

467
00:38:49,011 --> 00:38:51,583
catheter., I'd like to know, too.

468
00:38:51,586 --> 00:38:53,426
- What? It.

469
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:56,051
Sir, the bureaucracy
doesn't scare me.

470
00:38:56,052 --> 00:38:58,543
This is the work of
the social service.

471
00:38:59,004 --> 00:39:01,095
Yes, I will send it
to you and I hope

472
00:39:01,096 --> 00:39:03,132
it will be more
than enough for you.

473
00:39:05,609 --> 00:39:07,154
May I have your name, please?

474
00:39:10,116 --> 00:39:15,656
Thank you. Yes, have
a nice day. Idiot.

475
00:39:15,879 --> 00:39:20,708
It must rotate every two
hours to prevent infection.

476
00:39:20,709 --> 00:39:22,319
I... decubitus,

477
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,519
skin care, In this
case, don't be afraid.

478
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,320
I'll show you how
the catheter works.

479
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:36,995
Look where I'm going...,
You pull this tube in

480
00:39:36,996 --> 00:39:39,964
as it goes and the first
urine will come out.

481
00:39:39,967 --> 00:39:41,966
- There we go, there

482
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,979
There...

483
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:52,980
And that goes in the bag, okay?
Okay where we forget. Forget it.

484
00:39:55,024 --> 00:40:01,332
Brooke, look. Everyone's
working on your new room.

485
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:03,794
- Hi kids.
- Hi Brooke.

486
00:40:07,628 --> 00:40:08,628
Hi Brooky.

487
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:14,184
This will be your new room.
You will get a new big bed.

488
00:40:14,185 --> 00:40:16,363
It's beautiful, isn't it?

489
00:40:16,563 --> 00:40:20,000
- Say hello to Brooke, guys.
- The house is being renovated.

490
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:21,148
- A little while.

491
00:40:22,816 --> 00:40:25,909
Brooke, let's eat
on the ironing board.

492
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,268
It's really an ironing board.

493
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:32,086
I want to play you a
song, but the piano

494
00:40:32,087 --> 00:40:35,882
is hidden, so I decided
to tell you a joke

495
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:43,059
What is the peak of the blind man?
Living in the street of good view.

496
00:40:45,127 --> 00:40:46,300
How great.

497
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:04,745
Kysten, it's Mum.

498
00:41:04,846 --> 00:41:10,033
That? Hi honey, you
will do me a great favour.

499
00:41:10,036 --> 00:41:11,764
- You can.

500
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:16,081
I know I'm not a good mother right

501
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:18,619
now, and it bothers
me., How is it?

502
00:41:18,819 --> 00:41:25,788
I try to bring her home, though I
still can't and I need your help.

503
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:29,739
I need you to help me
take care of my youngest

504
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,056
daughter because I won't
be able to do it alone.

505
00:41:34,646 --> 00:41:36,464
Do you promise to help me?

506
00:41:36,465 --> 00:41:39,974
That. You don't say that
because you have to? Not.

507
00:41:40,822 --> 00:41:48,822
- Just go home. Brooke and you.
- Yes, we try and do our best.

508
00:41:49,618 --> 00:41:54,328
- I love you, I love you so much.
- I love you too.

509
00:41:55,581 --> 00:41:59,071
- Alright. Good night.
- Goodbye.

510
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:13,873
We first need to put a spiral
plastic around her spine.

511
00:42:14,897 --> 00:42:19,705
We need to stabilise her
neck above her spinal cord.

512
00:42:21,015 --> 00:42:24,696
The operation is not easy and
we cannot guarantee success.

513
00:42:24,697 --> 00:42:26,448
How do you define success?

514
00:42:26,894 --> 00:42:27,934
That she survives at all.

515
00:42:27,935 --> 00:42:30,248
Then we have nothing to talk
about. None of the surgery.

516
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:34,186
We can't force
anyone into surgery,

517
00:42:34,187 --> 00:42:37,037
but if we leave it as it is,

518
00:42:38,187 --> 00:42:39,576
one wrong move could kill her.

519
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:50,501
Two more breaths
and we start surgery.

520
00:42:50,502 --> 00:42:52,157
Implant., Implatat.

521
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:06,379
- Let's do it.
- Pliers., Klješta.

522
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:13,705
- Nothing.
- We got her.

523
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:18,599
We're.

524
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:30,464
Let's turn her on her back.
Carefully.

525
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:33,331
Connect it to a respirator.
We burn

526
00:43:33,332 --> 00:43:36,038
it. The respirator
is in operation.

527
00:43:52,137 --> 00:43:53,171
Everything went well.

528
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:56,875
We'll wait for her to recover for
a few days, then she can go home.

529
00:44:04,913 --> 00:44:10,051
Hello. Here we are.
Here we are, Hey.

530
00:44:10,052 --> 00:44:11,851
We made it.

531
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:15,981
- Really good.
- Look, there's everybody.

532
00:44:16,585 --> 00:44:19,188
Let me see you, team.
One, two and three.

533
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,727
Welcome Brooke Ellison.

534
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:30,558
How are you, kids?

535
00:44:32,523 --> 00:44:34,878
- Welcome.
- Welcome Brooke Ellison.

536
00:44:49,767 --> 00:44:53,037
Ready? One, two... and three.

537
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:56,329
Okay.

538
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:59,833
- You okay, honey?
- Yes.

539
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:02,601
- Good.
- Thank you very much.

540
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,250
I'm home.

541
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:26,385
That's right, and we'll
try to keep it that way.

542
00:45:31,225 --> 00:45:32,828
I made up a joke.

543
00:45:33,292 --> 00:45:39,291
How does an adventure among the stars
look like? How? We don't know how?

544
00:45:39,292 --> 00:45:41,292
Shines only at night.

545
00:45:44,385 --> 00:45:49,484
No no no., When is it
coming to throw the trash?

546
00:45:49,485 --> 00:45:52,385
Look, you've become smart.

547
00:46:07,569 --> 00:46:10,687
- I'm glad you're back.
- I'm glad as well.

548
00:46:16,983 --> 00:46:19,977
I'm sorry, I don't understand you.

549
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:21,426
Just a moment, please.

550
00:46:22,043 --> 00:46:25,251
Headmaster from school. She says
Brooke can't go back to school.

551
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:28,076
Hi, I'm Ed Ellison.

552
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,124
Yes, I'll take care of it.

553
00:46:34,754 --> 00:46:38,216
Excuse me, please tell
me your name, please.

554
00:46:38,898 --> 00:46:41,848
We wish all the best to
your daughter, but taking

555
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:44,978
care of her is not in the
description of our school.

556
00:46:45,378 --> 00:46:49,497
There is a cost to a doctor who
cannot take good care of her.

557
00:46:49,874 --> 00:46:51,974
We are also concerned
about what your daughter

558
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,121
will challenge between
students and professors.

559
00:46:54,996 --> 00:47:00,713
It can feel incomoded for its
damage. We end the meeting.

560
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,138
Mr Evans. Excuse me, hello.
I'm Jean

561
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:10,442
Ellison. Brooke is my daughter.

562
00:47:10,724 --> 00:47:12,317
I'm so sorry for the accident.

563
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:14,203
Sir, my daughter wants
to go back to this

564
00:47:14,204 --> 00:47:16,224
school more than anything
else in the world.

565
00:47:16,225 --> 00:47:17,929
If you do not have
a suitable sister

566
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,543
for her, I will go to her classes.

567
00:47:19,544 --> 00:47:20,825
Are you expert in this?

568
00:47:21,298 --> 00:47:23,127
Not., That's what
I thought, you're

569
00:47:23,128 --> 00:47:24,703
not qualified to care for her.

570
00:47:24,704 --> 00:47:27,968
I've been watching her
for nine months and 24

571
00:47:27,969 --> 00:47:31,093
hours a day, I can pass
that qualification.

572
00:47:31,835 --> 00:47:34,231
Excuse me... I can do it.
Brooke has been

573
00:47:34,232 --> 00:47:36,629
studying and is ready
to return to class.

574
00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:40,558
- Sorry, that's impossible.
- Why, why is it not possible?

575
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,226
The board and her
doctor must approve

576
00:47:44,227 --> 00:47:47,895
you as a caregiver.
I'm sorry, madam,

577
00:47:47,896 --> 00:47:51,051
but as the law says from
this there will be nothing.

578
00:47:58,069 --> 00:48:01,470
Mum, Mum.

579
00:48:04,603 --> 00:48:06,975
Isn't it time you
prepared me for school?

580
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:18,902
Okay, here I am, honey.

581
00:48:29,637 --> 00:48:30,637
Good.

582
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:40,899
Good girl, good girl, good girl.
We're almost done.

583
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,289
- Is it comfortable?
- Yes

584
00:49:10,703 --> 00:49:11,915
Okay.

585
00:49:13,538 --> 00:49:14,538
Okay.

586
00:49:43,929 --> 00:49:46,999
- Comfortable? Yeah.
- Good., Good.

587
00:49:19,879 --> 00:49:24,228
We're almost done, baby.
Excited? That., Yes, me too.

588
00:49:24,229 --> 00:49:27,879
Although I'm a little
nervous, Yeah, me too.

589
00:49:47,347 --> 00:49:49,410
- Is this nice to you?
- Yes.

590
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,343
I'll brush your teeth.

591
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:08,674
Good.

592
00:50:09,487 --> 00:50:10,692
So.

593
00:50:12,494 --> 00:50:14,557
The teeth are clean and now we go.

594
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,625
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

595
00:50:21,397 --> 00:50:22,397
How I look?

596
00:50:22,398 --> 00:50:25,381
You're the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen in my life.

597
00:50:25,441 --> 00:50:26,441
It's not true.

598
00:50:26,442 --> 00:50:28,811
Except your mother
when I first saw her.

599
00:50:29,011 --> 00:50:33,278
I'm not., Of course you are and I won't
let anyone say otherwise., Cut it out.

600
00:50:33,279 --> 00:50:34,701
I'm lucky.

601
00:50:37,907 --> 00:50:39,415
Did you see my...

602
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:43,944
It's in the bathroom. Thank you.
It's never going to change, huh?

603
00:50:43,945 --> 00:50:44,945
Not.

604
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:05,742
- All right, ready?
- Yes.

605
00:51:14,078 --> 00:51:15,213
The moment.

606
00:51:15,966 --> 00:51:17,995
Good morning., We talked
about this yesterday...

607
00:51:17,996 --> 00:51:18,673
That's right.

608
00:51:18,674 --> 00:51:19,207
And I said...

609
00:51:19,208 --> 00:51:20,808
Here's a letter from
a doctor saying I am

610
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:22,592
qualified caregiver.

611
00:51:29,929 --> 00:51:32,177
I can't know.
The letter is quite cheesy.

612
00:51:32,377 --> 00:51:35,280
Help a little.
I am grateful for all the help.

613
00:51:36,947 --> 00:51:39,224
- Hi Mr Lynskey., Hi.
- Right., Hi.

614
00:51:39,424 --> 00:51:45,098
Good good., Okay, open it. Here.
And let's go upstairs. Come.

615
00:51:45,099 --> 00:51:47,902
And worse., Good.,
Good., Thank you.

616
00:51:47,903 --> 00:51:51,282
Really good., Really
good., And here we are.

617
00:52:04,603 --> 00:52:08,908
Hi., Hi. I feel we're late.
Will not be repeated., Good.

618
00:52:08,909 --> 00:52:11,355
Good morning. Here you go?
Thank you. I will

619
00:52:11,356 --> 00:52:13,695
sit with her from now
on., Yes, of course.

620
00:52:13,995 --> 00:52:15,562
- Hi Brooke.
- Hi.

621
00:52:17,588 --> 00:52:21,951
Hi., Hi Brooke, how wonderful.
Welcome Brooke.

622
00:52:21,952 --> 00:52:23,733
Come here., Here.

623
00:52:24,085 --> 00:52:26,783
Come here., Wow,
how handsome you are.

624
00:52:26,784 --> 00:52:28,825
All right, children. Begins.

625
00:52:29,208 --> 00:52:31,474
Welcome geometry.

626
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,181
Now I will write a
word on the board

627
00:52:33,182 --> 00:52:34,349
for those who do
not know the word.

628
00:52:35,675 --> 00:52:38,414
Geometry.

629
00:52:38,626 --> 00:52:41,352
- That word, what does it mean?
- Set of numbers.

630
00:52:41,814 --> 00:52:43,813
That?

631
00:52:43,814 --> 00:52:49,814
Set of numbers., Exactly.
So a set of b r o js.

632
00:52:49,991 --> 00:52:56,546
Who can tell me what a rhombus is?
Yes? Body., Romb is...

633
00:52:56,547 --> 00:53:03,011
I leave it to you to resolve these
light points. Give it a thought.

634
00:53:03,111 --> 00:53:11,111
So the circle is X + 40-2.
The circle is X, what do you get?

635
00:53:14,363 --> 00:53:19,819
- Circle, circle.
- Mum, mum.

636
00:53:21,336 --> 00:53:22,992
Brooke? A line down the middle.

637
00:53:22,993 --> 00:53:26,156
A line down the middle. That's
right. Line down the middle.

638
00:53:26,356 --> 00:53:29,913
Snoozed, snoozed. Okay,
now take the calculators

639
00:53:29,914 --> 00:53:32,746
for this question.
You have a cylinder

640
00:53:32,946 --> 00:53:34,763
which has a diameter
of 2 inches that

641
00:53:34,764 --> 00:53:36,438
is the same as its depth, which is

642
00:53:36,638 --> 00:53:42,069
its volume and scope of
this cylinder? Brooke? 1.37.

643
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:44,638
Bingo, we got a winner.

644
00:53:45,916 --> 00:53:53,472
1.37. E team, do me a favour,
so repeat this chapter at home.

645
00:53:54,872 --> 00:53:56,932
Hey Reed, try it.

646
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,587
- Are you there maybe?
- Hi, Kysten.

647
00:54:02,787 --> 00:54:04,427
Hi. We really want to know.

648
00:54:10,017 --> 00:54:11,808
I will be the fastest
button in the competition,

649
00:54:11,809 --> 00:54:13,381
thanks to this., That.
Give it another go.

650
00:54:16,617 --> 00:54:17,917
New Yourk Looking for
talent in physics.

651
00:54:17,919 --> 00:54:23,087
Our reading reads: The word
lazy is a substitute for?

652
00:54:23,088 --> 00:54:25,423
The figuration of the
word is information that

653
00:54:25,424 --> 00:54:27,512
the person is exhausted.,
Correct answer.

654
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,727
She knew.

655
00:54:34,728 --> 00:54:37,239
I do not know. But there
must be another question.

656
00:54:37,613 --> 00:54:44,057
If Adam was writing on A4 paper,
how much light did he need?

657
00:54:48,256 --> 00:54:51,309
The most powerful bulb.
Exactly. The most powerful bulb.

658
00:55:01,105 --> 00:55:05,458
Last question: What
happens when an orange

659
00:55:05,459 --> 00:55:09,105
is electrified with
a yellow cloth?

660
00:55:12,944 --> 00:55:14,649
- Neon.
- No.

661
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:21,888
- Cullen?
- That's anger. Anger. Exactly.

662
00:55:30,042 --> 00:55:32,901
Teams are ready for
the decisive question:

663
00:55:34,407 --> 00:55:38,575
- Sometimes there is a reason...
- Pressure.

664
00:55:39,027 --> 00:55:41,830
I didn't finish the question.
Please listen carefully.

665
00:55:42,933 --> 00:55:45,724
Sometimes for some
reason the pressure

666
00:55:45,725 --> 00:55:48,946
jumps, is it because
of the pressure or why?

667
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,274
Because of the reflex.

668
00:55:52,275 --> 00:55:54,666
That's right.
Because of the reflex.

669
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,283
Ladies and gentlemen,
these are the winners

670
00:56:00,284 --> 00:56:03,306
of the 1997 New Yourk
talent in physics.

671
00:56:13,385 --> 00:56:16,329
Brooke, here's a
letter from Harward.

672
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:19,865
Yes? Do you want me to
open it for you? That.

673
00:56:22,401 --> 00:56:26,463
Dear Miss Ellison, We liked your
notes so much that I could be

674
00:56:26,464 --> 00:56:29,775
candidate at Harward University,
we only have one more place.

675
00:56:31,007 --> 00:56:33,659
Mum, do you hear this?
Let me hear.

676
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:37,431
I think this is a sign
that I should go to Harward.

677
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,485
I believe another sign
will tell you not to go.

678
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,747
How did they dare to
send a letter when they

679
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:46,169
did not know her situation?
That is not fair.

680
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:47,961
Too bad for them.

681
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,800
- Jean.
- Yes?

682
00:57:01,834 --> 00:57:03,230
A letter came from Harward.

683
00:57:07,014 --> 00:57:08,601
I don't know if it's inflammation?

684
00:57:10,617 --> 00:57:12,159
I don't want her
to be disappointed.

685
00:57:14,913 --> 00:57:19,735
She's grown up. Brooke., That?
A letter came from Harward.

686
00:57:20,516 --> 00:57:21,516
Do you want me to open?

687
00:57:25,348 --> 00:57:27,391
Yes Yes.

688
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:37,561
Congratulations. Oh, my God.
Oh my God. What?

689
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:44,198
Congratulations, you entered
Harward University next year

690
00:57:45,538 --> 00:57:47,926
I have to sit. I can't believe it.

691
00:57:55,928 --> 00:57:58,263
What would happen if I could
actually go to that university?

692
00:57:58,264 --> 00:57:59,264
You're kidding, right?

693
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:03,459
What's missing from
Johnny Birds School?

694
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:05,946
Nothing, both
schools are beautiful.

695
00:58:05,947 --> 00:58:08,589
But still Harvard is Harvard.

696
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:10,689
But Harvard is not here.
Which will travel for

697
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,701
five hours every day,
I don't think it will.

698
00:58:12,702 --> 00:58:14,658
Mum will come with her.

699
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:17,711
Super, great for
us, great for dad,

700
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:20,108
life has finally
returned to normal

701
00:58:20,109 --> 00:58:22,184
and one letter will ruin it again

702
00:58:22,384 --> 00:58:24,294
Kysten.
Put that letter in your ass.

703
00:58:27,884 --> 00:58:31,888
- What do we do now?
- I think Harvard is her dream.

704
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:34,819
We're stuck in the water
down to our throats.

705
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:39,984
- Now we have to raise our heads.
- Yes.

706
00:58:42,326 --> 00:58:45,549
Although... There is
always some interlative

707
00:58:46,175 --> 00:58:49,383
I mean, if Brooke is
realistic, everyone will

708
00:58:49,384 --> 00:58:52,872
look at her there as a
kid who can't do anything.

709
00:58:52,873 --> 00:58:54,929
She'll understand.

710
00:58:58,941 --> 00:59:02,940
Not. The problem is with me.
I can't leave, I

711
00:59:02,941 --> 00:59:06,941
can't leave Kysten and
Reed, neither can you.

712
00:59:07,765 --> 00:59:14,986
Maybe seeking help from a
personal assistant is worth a try?

713
00:59:17,481 --> 00:59:22,004
Impossible, how will
they live without me?

714
00:59:24,718 --> 00:59:27,106
- She can live without you.
- Do not give.

715
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:44,846
We think it's best to start with
a list of possible problems.

716
00:59:45,686 --> 00:59:50,353
If Brooke comes to Harvard, she'll
need a special wheelchair room.

717
00:59:50,812 --> 00:59:54,595
And a 56 square foot bathroom.

718
00:59:55,374 --> 00:59:59,164
Yes, if you don't have
the right staff for her,

719
00:59:59,165 --> 01:00:03,113
her mother understands
and will live with Brooke.

720
01:00:03,114 --> 01:00:05,263
And he will accompany
her to lectures.

721
01:00:05,463 --> 01:00:08,072
For classes that will not be
accessible due to wheelchairs.

722
01:00:08,073 --> 01:00:09,553
Brooke will need transportation.

723
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:15,725
This will give you an insight
into our economic situation and...

724
01:00:16,117 --> 01:00:21,505
our limited expenses for...
clothes... and desires and needs.

725
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:23,345
Thank you, Mr Ellison.

726
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:31,722
- Excuse me, are you done?
- Yes, I am.

727
01:00:40,034 --> 01:00:42,282
We need to see how
to meet all these

728
01:00:42,283 --> 01:00:44,349
needs and talk to the homeowners,

729
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:49,096
but we believe we will
meet all these needs.

730
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:59,962
- Wow.
- Good., Good., Thank you.

731
01:01:00,162 --> 01:01:05,085
Then we guess we'll think...

732
01:01:11,535 --> 01:01:13,028
I think the university
will faint if

733
01:01:13,029 --> 01:01:14,482
you show them how
talented you are.

734
01:01:17,294 --> 01:01:18,357
I love you.

735
01:01:20,423 --> 01:01:22,357
- I love you too.
- Goodbye.

736
01:01:23,818 --> 01:01:24,875
I love you.

737
01:01:27,237 --> 01:01:28,237
I love you.

738
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,019
Good luck.

739
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,787
Thanks for coming.
Goodbye. Goodbye.

740
01:01:44,154 --> 01:01:46,456
- Take care of your mother.
- I will.

741
01:01:46,457 --> 01:01:49,199
If these kids are teasing
you, write down the names.

742
01:01:49,696 --> 01:01:50,696
Thank you.

743
01:01:56,821 --> 01:01:58,284
Good.

744
01:02:22,949 --> 01:02:27,091
- Hi.
- Hi., I'm Brooke. And me, Lee.

745
01:02:27,572 --> 01:02:30,472
I'm like this because I
was hit by a car at the age

746
01:02:30,473 --> 01:02:33,318
of 11. Joining pages will
not be a problem for me.

747
01:02:36,733 --> 01:02:39,131
Hi, my name is Jack.,
Hi, nice to meet you.

748
01:02:39,132 --> 01:02:40,905
Hi, are you her mum? Yes, Jean.

749
01:02:41,005 --> 01:02:44,087
- I'm glad.
- Hi, I'm Mory. Hi. How are you?

750
01:02:44,287 --> 01:02:50,750
Our system has something we call
neurons and one is very special,

751
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:57,234
and that is what drives our body
and helps the brain make contact

752
01:02:57,434 --> 01:03:00,804
with the other one. The
neuron separates from the

753
01:03:00,805 --> 01:03:04,042
other and when it does,
it is called in physics

754
01:03:04,043 --> 01:03:05,142
Synapsis.

755
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:17,115
I think no marriage, if
honest two minds are vicious,

756
01:03:17,315 --> 01:03:21,228
that love is not love, if you
always change for the moment,

757
01:03:21,229 --> 01:03:25,151
distance is always
distance or not,

758
01:03:25,152 --> 01:03:28,213
it is just perhaps a false
happiness smouldering in silence.

759
01:03:48,648 --> 01:03:50,030
Hi, Caren., Hi girls.

760
01:03:50,031 --> 01:03:52,798
What's up? The love
story will be tonight.

761
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,760
A love story with Dan Onill?

762
01:03:54,761 --> 01:03:58,030
I don't know who that is?
I'm wasting my time.

763
01:03:58,031 --> 01:03:59,909
It's best for me when
it comes to Porshe.

764
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:01,490
Hey, will you have dinner with us?

765
01:04:01,491 --> 01:04:05,192
Second day. I hope to get
in touch with someone tonight.

766
01:04:05,193 --> 01:04:06,761
Have a nice time., Hi.

767
01:04:06,762 --> 01:04:07,762
Hi.

768
01:04:10,383 --> 01:04:13,393
All the girls seem
to have boyfriends.

769
01:04:13,394 --> 01:04:17,654
No, it's just Caren's second.
And one will come to you.

770
01:04:19,133 --> 01:04:20,134
Do you really think that?

771
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:28,354
Yes, I think every person in the
world finds a soulmate. Let's go.

772
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:32,885
Joseph Conrad said
while writing that the

773
01:04:32,886 --> 01:04:36,585
likelihood of the universe
judging us was high.

774
01:04:36,785 --> 01:04:37,552
What is he really talking about?

775
01:04:37,752 --> 01:04:40,215
This is a great question.
I think he

776
01:04:40,216 --> 01:04:42,546
blurs his natural world ethically.

777
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:46,325
- I think Conrad is too graceful.
- He plays God.

778
01:04:46,326 --> 01:04:48,439
It's okay to play God sometimes.

779
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:51,425
Come on. I expected
more from Harvard youth.

780
01:04:51,426 --> 01:04:54,638
I think Conrad's words seem to
make him visualise the universe

781
01:04:54,838 --> 01:04:57,431
that he doesn't even
have those words

782
01:04:57,432 --> 01:05:00,026
explained. I have
a feeling Conrad...

783
01:05:00,126 --> 01:05:03,363
judge yourself as if it
were a human God., That.

784
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:07,193
Set. Conrad was
threatened with the

785
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:10,002
truth, so he didn't
even dare to ask.

786
01:05:10,202 --> 01:05:14,009
Maybe he didn't think
about the mud, but maybe...

787
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:17,666
he was talking about
France, what do you think?

788
01:05:23,408 --> 01:05:27,161
It's Saturday. What do you
think we order Chinese food for?

789
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,603
I'm not very hungry, Mum.

790
01:05:29,841 --> 01:05:31,479
- Hi Jan.
- Hi.

791
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:33,742
I just left something
out of the door for you.

792
01:05:33,743 --> 01:05:35,217
Yeah? What did you leave me for?

793
01:05:35,417 --> 01:05:38,735
More recently than
Frodor Dimistrovsky,

794
01:05:38,736 --> 01:05:41,059
He knows it as I do Conrad.

795
01:05:42,706 --> 01:05:44,707
What Chinese food
do you like most?

796
01:05:45,481 --> 01:05:46,977
From the ground.

797
01:05:47,177 --> 01:05:49,283
How about we order it now?

798
01:05:51,325 --> 01:05:52,325
Can.

799
01:05:54,505 --> 01:05:58,615
Excellent. Thank you.
Chinese, huh? Good idea.

800
01:06:00,809 --> 01:06:02,007
Are you done?

801
01:06:02,008 --> 01:06:05,046
Yes I am. And you? Yes, thank you.

802
01:06:05,752 --> 01:06:08,393
- Then, I'm going...
- Yes.

803
01:06:08,581 --> 01:06:09,666
Make yourself some tea.

804
01:06:13,421 --> 01:06:15,536
Why
do you like Conrad as an author?

805
01:06:18,771 --> 01:06:23,575
Think about it... he's a great
maestro in English poetry.

806
01:06:24,184 --> 01:06:26,578
And he didn't study
English until he was 19.

807
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:29,570
What else?

808
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:33,788
He lived intensively,
sailing the entire

809
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:36,383
world, absolutely every bit of it.

810
01:06:38,636 --> 01:06:41,309
I believe that poetry is
very similar to Conrad's.

811
01:06:42,115 --> 01:06:45,296
But we don't have to look far
from her to find the story.

812
01:06:46,691 --> 01:06:49,093
I hope you don't
mind this question,

813
01:06:49,094 --> 01:06:51,497
but how do you
control the stroller?

814
01:06:51,498 --> 01:06:53,222
I have a system in my mouth.

815
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,531
I have a language
with a lot of talent.

816
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:01,403
You think I'm lying?

817
01:07:01,404 --> 01:07:04,247
Let's see what's in
your fate cookie., Good.

818
01:07:04,248 --> 01:07:07,014
Look... he says you're
going to share a cookie

819
01:07:07,015 --> 01:07:09,782
with someone who has
never written in English.

820
01:07:11,241 --> 01:07:12,303
Let me see.

821
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:17,433
Thank you.

822
01:07:18,362 --> 01:07:19,985
What's in yours?

823
01:07:22,263 --> 01:07:24,944
You will meet one special girl.

824
01:07:26,048 --> 01:07:30,215
- It doesn't say that.
- No, it says exactly that.

825
01:07:39,333 --> 01:07:41,781
Are you sure you want
to call us, Cara?

826
01:07:41,782 --> 01:07:44,287
Yes, what do you say?

827
01:07:51,462 --> 01:07:52,462
Brooke.

828
01:07:55,590 --> 01:07:58,288
My hockey colleagues. Animals.

829
01:07:59,012 --> 01:08:00,510
Do you like hockey?

830
01:08:00,511 --> 01:08:04,010
I love hockey, but I
don't play it very well.

831
01:08:11,726 --> 01:08:14,341
- I would ask you something.
- Shoot?

832
01:08:15,735 --> 01:08:17,734
Will you dance with me
at the end of the year?

833
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:25,104
- No, no, but thanks.
- No?

834
01:08:25,552 --> 01:08:28,034
I'm glad you asked that.

835
01:08:29,953 --> 01:08:31,495
Don't make them feel sorry for me.

836
01:08:31,496 --> 01:08:33,290
But I don't want to
go with anyone else.

837
01:08:34,153 --> 01:08:36,593
If you're not coming with
me, I'm not going either.

838
01:08:36,594 --> 01:08:38,612
There have been disasters
in recent years.

839
01:08:43,246 --> 01:08:45,546
Is that a yes? Still going?
I'll get

840
01:08:45,547 --> 01:08:47,785
a ticket for your
mother too, okay?

841
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,269
- You can.
- You can.

842
01:09:14,515 --> 01:09:15,515
Thank you.

843
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:22,615
- Want to hear something weird?
- I love weird things.

844
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:24,516
By the way, that flower
fits you really well.

845
01:09:24,517 --> 01:09:25,784
Ah, thank you. It's gardenia.

846
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,340
It's beautiful.

847
01:09:32,526 --> 01:09:34,142
Now tell me what's so weird?

848
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:42,132
When I fall asleep and dream
I am never in a wheelchair.

849
01:09:42,332 --> 01:09:47,168
Only one. When I flew
about for the first year.

850
01:09:49,158 --> 01:09:51,592
I dreamt I was like this.
In the cart.

851
01:09:51,593 --> 01:09:53,791
And what do you do in your dreams?

852
01:09:55,626 --> 01:09:57,291
I dance everywhere.

853
01:10:00,874 --> 01:10:02,405
I dance to exhaustion.

854
01:10:03,052 --> 01:10:07,606
- Okay, so here we go.
- But I don't...

855
01:10:07,607 --> 01:10:12,444
I know I can't dance, but
I like to go easy dancing.

856
01:11:07,248 --> 01:11:08,862
I will miss this place.

857
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:13,109
Especially you will miss me.
You're

858
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:15,821
an amazing woman, Brooke Ellison.

859
01:11:55,888 --> 01:11:57,587
You'll miss the girls.

860
01:11:57,588 --> 01:12:01,199
You trust them? Not me.
I'll be back next year.

861
01:12:01,369 --> 01:12:03,424
- Oh, how cool.
- Gold,

862
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,411
- Until recently.
- Until recently.

863
01:12:08,549 --> 01:12:09,583
- Have a nice summer.
- And you.

864
01:12:09,585 --> 01:12:12,029
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Hi, Mr Ellison.

865
01:12:12,229 --> 01:12:14,229
Hi., I'm Jan Dylan and I'm
a friend of your daughter.

866
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:15,123
We're soldiers, I see.

867
01:12:15,124 --> 01:12:16,218
What a boy.

868
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:18,125
Jan.

869
01:12:25,927 --> 01:12:26,968
Hi.

870
01:12:27,754 --> 01:12:28,861
Hi.

871
01:12:33,252 --> 01:12:34,257
Honey,

872
01:12:35,502 --> 01:12:36,598
what bothers you?

873
01:12:39,686 --> 01:12:42,916
Jan is done with the studio.
They won't be coming back.

874
01:12:42,917 --> 01:12:45,089
By the way, why
don't we call him...

875
01:12:45,767 --> 01:12:48,605
this summer, say
the Fourth of July?

876
01:12:48,606 --> 01:12:52,027
Jan travels promoting
Joseph Conrad's words.

877
01:12:52,028 --> 01:12:52,853
Joseph who?

878
01:12:52,854 --> 01:12:55,332
Dad, Joseph Conrad
is a writer., Oh.

879
01:12:56,384 --> 01:12:59,459
Okay, how about Thanksgiving?
It's November.

880
01:12:59,659 --> 01:13:04,791
Before Thanksgiving is Labour Day.
Labour Day is not celebrated.

881
01:13:05,402 --> 01:13:08,861
What does he know. He's Russian.
It's Slovak. Slovak, the better.

882
01:13:08,862 --> 01:13:10,674
Ok, are you going to tell him

883
01:13:10,675 --> 01:13:12,987
Labour Day is a
big family holiday?

884
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:14,427
Only Christmas is bigger than him.

885
01:13:14,428 --> 01:13:15,635
Wait, I'm back for a moment.

886
01:13:18,654 --> 01:13:19,654
Jan.

887
01:13:24,544 --> 01:13:26,253
My sister wants to
tell you something.

888
01:13:28,089 --> 01:13:29,762
- Reed.
- What is it?

889
01:13:30,105 --> 01:13:31,105
Hi, I'm sorry. Only...

890
01:13:32,704 --> 01:13:34,694
I mean I know you're travelling...

891
01:13:35,976 --> 01:13:38,522
And I don't know if
there's any chance of

892
01:13:38,523 --> 01:13:41,010
you returning to
America by November but

893
01:13:42,799 --> 01:13:45,529
I would love to have
Thanksgiving with my family,

894
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:48,706
You know people have a
traditional Thanksgiving dinner.

895
01:13:49,542 --> 01:13:52,014
- My mum's the best cook.
- I would love that.

896
01:13:52,809 --> 01:13:53,809
That?

897
01:13:54,451 --> 01:13:55,719
Really can?

898
01:13:56,363 --> 01:13:57,363
Ok then.

899
01:13:58,036 --> 01:14:00,404
Okay, see you then.

900
01:14:02,230 --> 01:14:04,809
Have a nice trip.
Hi, Jan. Hi., Hi.

901
01:14:06,981 --> 01:14:08,532
Let's go home to celebrate this.

902
01:14:17,708 --> 01:14:20,504
If you've been doing this
all summer, you're weird.

903
01:14:23,413 --> 01:14:24,634
We have mail.

904
01:14:25,838 --> 01:14:27,837
Two packages are from the
library from the university.

905
01:14:28,037 --> 01:14:30,080
The university sent the
final paper for Brooke.

906
01:14:30,642 --> 01:14:31,642
- You think?
- Of course.

907
01:14:34,015 --> 01:14:35,962
Who do we know in Madagascar?

908
01:14:36,587 --> 01:14:37,587
Jana?

909
01:14:38,019 --> 01:14:40,765
- Yes.
- Open it., Read.

910
01:14:45,151 --> 01:14:46,377
"Dear Brooke.

911
01:14:46,577 --> 01:14:49,148
At the moment,
I watch the sunset on

912
01:14:49,149 --> 01:14:51,791
the Indian Ocean in
complete silence.

913
01:14:52,255 --> 01:14:56,542
Joseph
Conrad shared justice, so I try.

914
01:14:57,263 --> 01:14:59,530
Now I'm heading east to Mambo.

915
01:14:59,730 --> 01:15:04,017
Forgive me, but I can't return
to the US until... Thanksgiving,

916
01:15:04,217 --> 01:15:06,843
but now I have an email address.

917
01:15:06,844 --> 01:15:09,964
Please stay in touch.
Love you. Jan"

918
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:21,270
He misses you, but he does what he

919
01:15:21,271 --> 01:15:25,440
loves. He travels
the world., That.

920
01:15:27,489 --> 01:15:29,297
How could you call me a nerd?

921
01:15:29,298 --> 01:15:32,275
When you're so smart,
why did you get confused?

922
01:15:32,276 --> 01:15:36,481
- I'm not stupid. Who says that?
- The one who eats the bread?

923
01:15:36,681 --> 01:15:39,851
I know that. Who are you going
with? You're being critical.

924
01:15:39,852 --> 01:15:42,103
He's talented and
has a knack for joking.

925
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:46,203
And it can't be more convenient
and it's not a parasite.

926
01:15:46,204 --> 01:15:49,512
And he has a nice smile.
They're kidding you.

927
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:52,729
- Team, we have to go., Oh no.
- 50 minutes., Good.

928
01:15:52,929 --> 01:15:56,297
- Goodbye Brooke.
- Goodbye Brooke., See you later.

929
01:15:57,466 --> 01:15:58,466
Come on.

930
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:00,844
- I am not hungry.
- But you have to eat.

931
01:16:01,662 --> 01:16:02,891
But I'm not hungry.

932
01:16:12,763 --> 01:16:16,212
Then can you comment
for us when it's

933
01:16:16,213 --> 01:16:19,300
over when the guy meets the girl?

934
01:16:20,404 --> 01:16:22,567
Is it possible that...?

935
01:16:23,407 --> 01:16:24,771
I need to turn you around.

936
01:16:25,178 --> 01:16:28,216
- No, it's not necessary.
- Of course it is.

937
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:31,962
You have an open
wound on your butt.

938
01:16:33,112 --> 01:16:37,087
You
haven't had her... since rehab.

939
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:41,042
If you had eaten as
God had commanded,

940
01:16:41,043 --> 01:16:43,214
this would not have happened.

941
01:16:43,414 --> 01:16:45,574
- Do you hear me Brooke?
- It's not that bad.

942
01:16:45,874 --> 01:16:47,391
Of course it's terrible.

943
01:16:48,523 --> 01:16:52,200
If you get infected, you won't be
able to sit in your wheelchair.

944
01:16:52,948 --> 01:16:54,548
Are you planning to write
a final paper from bed?

945
01:16:54,723 --> 01:16:56,175
Stop torturing me.

946
01:16:59,431 --> 01:17:01,136
I'm torturing you?

947
01:17:02,097 --> 01:17:04,931
Hey, I have to get up
every two hours to turn you

948
01:17:04,932 --> 01:17:07,597
around like a baby and
then I'm torturing you?

949
01:17:08,335 --> 01:17:09,920
Mum. Mum.

950
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:14,680
It's over with Joseph Conrad.
I'm a victim of Joseph Conrad.

951
01:17:14,742 --> 01:17:15,980
Turn off the light.

952
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:20,540
Nothing.

953
01:17:27,573 --> 01:17:28,935
You have to eat.

954
01:17:32,401 --> 01:17:37,952
Alright. I give up. If
you give up, so will I.

955
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:39,416
But you will never give up.

956
01:17:39,417 --> 01:17:40,878
So if you need help
getting you off the

957
01:17:40,879 --> 01:17:42,232
bed, this spirit
will do it for you.

958
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:43,524
Do I get a ghost?

959
01:17:49,004 --> 01:17:50,297
Don't ever leave me, Mum.

960
01:17:53,204 --> 01:17:55,027
Your company is uplifting me and

961
01:17:55,028 --> 01:17:57,193
therefore I could
finish this study.

962
01:17:58,778 --> 01:18:03,306
And lastly... What mother
would do this for me?

963
01:18:05,307 --> 01:18:07,604
There is no room for
me in this world, Mum.

964
01:18:07,605 --> 01:18:09,104
You can't know that either.

965
01:18:09,304 --> 01:18:11,684
You will be in this
world for a long time,

966
01:18:12,212 --> 01:18:15,091
But you have to
decide if you want to

967
01:18:15,092 --> 01:18:18,047
belong to this world
and be paralysed?

968
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:21,742
You.

969
01:18:41,982 --> 01:18:44,643
So... what do you want to do?

970
01:18:45,602 --> 01:18:48,263
Get up and go out and
watch the sunset or rest?

971
01:18:49,419 --> 01:18:51,669
Pass
me the laptop and headset, please.

972
01:18:56,225 --> 01:19:01,630
I will finish my essay
and graduate thesis.

973
01:19:02,615 --> 01:19:05,037
I've never been in a
love depression yet, but

974
01:19:05,038 --> 01:19:07,461
I don't mean to give up
on Harvard right now.

975
01:19:08,188 --> 01:19:14,498
And I decided to find a job...
maybe at an old elementary school.

976
01:19:16,338 --> 01:19:17,338
What?

977
01:19:18,373 --> 01:19:21,343
Groups, standard: 25

978
01:19:21,846 --> 01:19:23,831
Number: 9550 Number: 4

979
01:19:25,087 --> 01:19:26,421
Fifth point, ok.

980
01:19:27,183 --> 01:19:29,051
- Honey, just a minute.
- Okay.

981
01:19:30,771 --> 01:19:31,771
Open an email.

982
01:19:37,092 --> 01:19:38,092
Insert.

983
01:19:38,872 --> 01:19:41,178
"It's cold today.

984
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:47,327
Where are you? Pusa. "Send.

985
01:19:48,131 --> 01:19:49,131
Where are we?

986
01:19:49,132 --> 01:19:51,555
Molekule. Calculator,
please., That.

987
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:55,745
Mum, are you okay? You're cold.

988
01:19:55,746 --> 01:20:00,487
No, I'm just excited
about this calculation.

989
01:20:03,877 --> 01:20:07,782
- I'd work all night, why not?
- Because... it would kill you.

990
01:20:07,982 --> 01:20:10,406
Okay, it wouldn't kill
you, but it would kill me

991
01:20:11,623 --> 01:20:14,550
We menopausal women
should not rise at night.

992
01:20:14,798 --> 01:20:16,128
I have to go lie down.

993
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:18,657
My peace and pain don't
know for a long time.

994
01:20:19,623 --> 01:20:21,827
"Chapter 6 Discussion"

995
01:20:22,942 --> 01:20:27,313
"The results of this study...
are the courage,

996
01:20:27,314 --> 01:20:30,942
the informing... of
a close assistant,

997
01:20:32,305 --> 01:20:39,432
residency and optimism in
the life of a teenager."

998
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:45,752
Done, almost.

999
01:20:46,822 --> 01:20:47,822
Almost.

1000
01:20:48,798 --> 01:20:50,100
I change clothes and I'm done.

1001
01:20:50,566 --> 01:20:53,061
Mum, the game is not
over yet, it's actually

1002
01:20:53,062 --> 01:20:55,558
just begun. Now I have
to defend that essay.

1003
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:56,991
I want to believe the truth.

1004
01:20:58,739 --> 01:21:01,089
Hey. How are you
doing? Is it bed time?

1005
01:21:01,848 --> 01:21:03,357
Ten more minutes.

1006
01:21:04,477 --> 01:21:07,124
Tomorrow is a great
day. You need to rest.

1007
01:21:08,377 --> 01:21:09,377
Post.

1008
01:21:10,513 --> 01:21:11,536
Open the mail

1009
01:21:13,687 --> 01:21:18,410
"Sorry, there was no contact
here. Big news... I'm engaged.

1010
01:21:18,411 --> 01:21:19,985
Jan"

1011
01:21:28,243 --> 01:21:30,453
"Congratulations."

1012
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:34,332
Are you ready?

1013
01:21:39,787 --> 01:21:41,783
What happened? Tell me.

1014
01:21:44,992 --> 01:21:45,992
Jan is getting married.

1015
01:21:54,433 --> 01:21:55,745
Not.

1016
01:22:01,306 --> 01:22:03,767
It just wasn't for you, my sun.

1017
01:22:07,190 --> 01:22:09,203
I know it doesn't
help now, but there

1018
01:22:09,204 --> 01:22:11,323
is no man who has
not broken his heart.

1019
01:22:13,381 --> 01:22:15,832
But everything will be fixed
when the right man arrives.

1020
01:22:22,133 --> 01:22:23,133
Mum.

1021
01:22:24,591 --> 01:22:25,591
That?

1022
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:30,814
If that doesn't happen to me,

1023
01:22:34,448 --> 01:22:35,933
will you be fine?

1024
01:22:39,764 --> 01:22:44,023
That. But I will not
lose hope that this

1025
01:22:44,024 --> 01:22:47,764
will happen one day, will you?
Not.

1026
01:22:51,767 --> 01:22:52,767
Not.

1027
01:23:02,477 --> 01:23:05,053
What standards do you
think you can offer

1028
01:23:05,054 --> 01:23:07,509
the system for those
who are different?

1029
01:23:07,709 --> 01:23:11,232
I believe my last name has the
potential to change the system.

1030
01:23:11,432 --> 01:23:13,882
My call is not
specifically specified.

1031
01:23:14,182 --> 01:23:16,967
How did you prepare
the stand in which

1032
01:23:16,968 --> 01:23:19,683
there is hope,
residency and reality?

1033
01:23:19,883 --> 01:23:22,474
I just brought you
a barrier analysis,

1034
01:23:22,475 --> 01:23:25,133
residences, and you
can compare that to

1035
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:28,241
to those of Hope
Street colleagues.

1036
01:23:28,242 --> 01:23:31,231
He brought us the same report?
That.

1037
01:23:31,331 --> 01:23:36,202
After the graphics were done,
I spent all night invoicing.

1038
01:23:36,402 --> 01:23:39,660
An invoice with a theme,
it proves that it actually

1039
01:23:39,661 --> 01:23:42,857
connects the city as a
residency as in colleagues.

1040
01:23:45,905 --> 01:23:48,065
Good. I believe it went well.

1041
01:23:48,681 --> 01:23:52,116
Well done what you indicated...
on the one when

1042
01:23:52,117 --> 01:23:55,196
you opened all the
cards, don't you think?

1043
01:23:56,194 --> 01:23:57,194
I hope.

1044
01:23:58,709 --> 01:24:00,653
Rest, rest.

1045
01:24:40,359 --> 01:24:44,185
- Let me see., First., Safe?
- That. Then it is.

1046
01:24:48,302 --> 01:24:49,683
Come in, please.

1047
01:25:04,644 --> 01:25:10,609
Miss Ellison, we have examined
your theory of positive thinking

1048
01:25:10,610 --> 01:25:15,460
how you see peace in the world.

1049
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,100
Another thing?

1050
01:25:21,892 --> 01:25:24,728
You have done a
wonderful job for public

1051
01:25:24,729 --> 01:25:27,081
policy with a price and so please

1052
01:25:27,082 --> 01:25:30,698
to continue doing these
static analyses for peace.

1053
01:25:32,934 --> 01:25:33,934
Thank you.

1054
01:25:35,556 --> 01:25:37,948
Thank you. Good girl.

1055
01:25:42,869 --> 01:25:43,869
Congratulations.

1056
01:25:44,235 --> 01:25:45,429
Thank you.

1057
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:48,393
Ladies and gentlemen, best
regards Brooke Ellison.

1058
01:25:58,949 --> 01:26:00,071
Good afternoon.

1059
01:26:02,493 --> 01:26:05,417
When I first came to
Harward four years ago.

1060
01:26:05,998 --> 01:26:08,622
I, too, have said goodbye
to many of my parents.

1061
01:26:10,133 --> 01:26:15,190
Like everyone else, my dad
left, but my mum didn't.

1062
01:26:16,283 --> 01:26:19,098
The presence of the mother,
though it is an unusual occurrence

1063
01:26:19,876 --> 01:26:20,943
I believe that everyone accepted

1064
01:26:20,944 --> 01:26:22,175
her, that she had
no social problems

1065
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:26,228
no matter that some are here
just for the sake of wealth.

1066
01:26:29,903 --> 01:26:32,983
My mother was with me
every hour and every day.

1067
01:26:33,708 --> 01:26:35,798
She followed me in all my classes,

1068
01:26:35,799 --> 01:26:38,259
from the first class
to the last test,

1069
01:26:46,779 --> 01:26:48,742
Although we don't
like being controlled

1070
01:26:48,743 --> 01:26:50,608
every moment because
of our hormones,

1071
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:54,204
We wouldn't be here
if they weren't...

1072
01:26:54,949 --> 01:26:57,262
put in their effort
and watched us when

1073
01:26:57,263 --> 01:26:59,404
we needed help on
this long journey.

1074
01:27:00,458 --> 01:27:03,139
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for

1075
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:05,897
my mother... But
without all of you.

1076
01:27:06,197 --> 01:27:09,258
Some of you have a
divorce from your

1077
01:27:09,259 --> 01:27:11,908
parents, professors or friends.

1078
01:27:12,859 --> 01:27:14,483
You just need someone to tell you

1079
01:27:14,484 --> 01:27:16,307
the right word at
the right time...

1080
01:27:17,613 --> 01:27:19,756
then no one would run anywhere.

1081
01:27:19,921 --> 01:27:22,487
Love and care for one another.

1082
01:27:22,488 --> 01:27:26,456
My mother and I learnt
a lot from each other.

1083
01:27:26,935 --> 01:27:29,901
We hope that period is behind us.

1084
01:27:30,485 --> 01:27:36,258
And one more thing,
I would never hurt anyone.

1085
01:27:39,646 --> 01:27:44,339
The weather is very fragile...
and strong.

1086
01:27:47,879 --> 01:27:51,931
Tomorrow I leave Harward...
with my

1087
01:27:51,932 --> 01:27:55,648
mother and you wonderful people.

1088
01:27:58,492 --> 01:28:00,928
Miracles exist.

1089
01:28:01,457 --> 01:28:06,277
It happened to me,
and it happens to you.

1090
01:28:08,389 --> 01:28:11,135
Just love the people that are in
your life whenever you see them.

1091
01:28:12,932 --> 01:28:16,252
Congratulations to
all and God bless you.

1092
01:28:36,828 --> 01:28:39,717
All right, all set. Ready?

1093
01:28:42,366 --> 01:28:45,554
Yeah, just... can I have a minute?

1094
01:28:45,918 --> 01:28:46,918
Of course.

1095
01:29:39,366 --> 01:29:41,172
After graduation.
Brooke holds a BA in

1096
01:29:41,173 --> 01:29:42,979
Public Policy from
Harward University.

1097
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:46,070
Jean went with her.

1098
01:29:46,071 --> 01:29:47,706
Brooke is pursuing a PhD at Stony

1099
01:29:47,707 --> 01:29:49,541
Booke University
near Ellison House

1100
01:29:49,542 --> 01:29:51,937
Ed and Jean are together again.
