I should have been an
 actor instead of a writer.

Oh, sweety, you can be butch.

159
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,750
But I was petrified
 that I would lose control

160
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,980
and my voice would
 rise an octave

161
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,870
and the spirit of Judy Garland
 would burst from my body.

162
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,430
Now, when has the
 spirit of Judy Garland

163
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,450
ever burst from your body?

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,150
Exactly.

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,530
But what if my first
 session was Frankenstein

166
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,730
was the moment when all my
 nelliness first surfaced.

You're being a tad
 offensive, you know.

168
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,500
That's the point.

169
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,690
I dripped of self-loathing,
 so terrifyingly

170
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,980

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,330

 announcement for fag haters.

We're going to nail this guy.

173
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,980
But get this.

174
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:12,120
Not once did he utter
 the word ga-- ga--

175
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,820
gay.

176
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,270
Like he'd spew
 fuzzy green chunks

177
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,110
if the dreaded G
 word passed his lips.

178
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,100
So I think next session, chunks.

179
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,720

If you were him, exactly
 what would you be expecting?

182
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,800
Well, if I were
 he, I'd expect lots

183
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,660
of doubts, lots of questions.

184
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,330
OK, I've got
 questions, Dr. Apsey.

185
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,490
I got questions.

186
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,500
I'd recommend asking them.

187
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,180
No Bible thumping.

188
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,170
I don't care what
 Jesus thinks of me.

189
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,010
I have no interest in
 Jesus's opinion of you either.

190
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,380
This is not Christian therapy.

191
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,120
Anything else?

192
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,210
Unorthodox techniques.

193
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,610
Like torture?

194
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,760
OK, no electric shocks.

195
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,400
No electric shocks.

196
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,650
No funny smells to make
 me puke when you flash

197
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,300
pictures of naked individuals.

198
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,470
No punishment stuff.

199
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,510
What you're describing
 is aversion therapy.

200
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,810
I promise none of that.

201
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,030
Only direct, honest talk.

202
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,810
So direct he couldn't
 even say the G word.

203
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,770
Yeah, couldn't say the word.

204
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,380
Then last week, why
 wouldn't you say the word?

205
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,120
What word was that?

206
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,290
The word.

207
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,270
Ah, yes, the word.

208
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,870
You refrain from using it.

209
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,080
So I chose similar restraint
 out of respect for you.

210
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,490
Have you ever employed
 it to describe yourself.

211
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,420
I've been to a
 therapist before.

212
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,120
I said it then.

213
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,620
I'd like to see
 copies of the records.

214
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,930
Forging records,
 that's inadvisable.

215
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,830
That's impossible.

216
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,850
The guy's died-- or
 moved-- or something.

217
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,870
Did this other
 therapist use aversion?

218
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,360
I don't remember.

219
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,820
You don't recall if
 he used electric shock?

220
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,720
Little electrodes
 over your body.

221
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,000
No.
 No shocks.

222
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,160
Any form of aversion?

223
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,250
No.

224
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,040
So how are you aware
 of aversion therapy?

225
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,540
There are books.

226
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,260
Ah, of course, I've read.

227
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,870
- I've read.
 - What books?

228
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,620
"The Recurrent Use
 of Aversion Techniques

229
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,420
in the Clinical Treatment
 of the Male Homosexual

230
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,860
in the 20th Century."

231
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,970
I don't remember the title.

232
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,220
You're aware of
 aversion therapy,

233
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,840
yet your previous
 therapist never used it.

234
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,610
You've read, but you
 don't remember the books.

235
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,310
If you were I, Frank,
 would you believe that?

236
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,220
A good therapist doesn't
 insinuate his client is lying.

237
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,800
I don't think a good therapist
 calls his client a liar.

238
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,020
Probably not.

239
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,590
- Are you lying?
 - No.

240
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,540
Maybe.

241
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,810
Maybe I never exactly
 been to a therapist.

242
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,370
Then my previous
 question remains.

243
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,570
Have you ever verbalized
 the word about yourself?

244
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,420
Could be not.

245
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,410
If you did, what would happen?

246
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,410
Your worst fear.
 - Oh, if I said it?

247
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,730
I'd puke my guts.

248
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,380
Fear of vomiting.
 Nothing more?

249
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,720
- There'd be more.
 - Of course, there's more.

250
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,090
DR. APSEY: Tell me.

251
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,100
- I don't know I got the words.
 - Find them.

252
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,400
I got, you know, a life, not a
 perfect life, but I'm standing.

253
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,360
And sometimes I think that
 one word and my tendons

254
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,880
let go my bones, my muscles turn
 to Jell-O, and I'd collapse.

255
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't think I can say
 that word and still stand.

256
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,700
Do it anyway.

257
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,220
I'm pressing, Frank, because
 the first step to change

258
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,050
is accepting what
 you want to change.

259
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,850
Hey, I accept it.

260
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,460
I quite doubt a human organism
 can accept something he

261
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,720
she won't verbalize.

262
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:07,990
Um--

263
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,310
Earlier, you said
 you had a life.

264
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,570
Yeah.

265
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,470
What type of life?

266
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,200
A supercalifragilistic
 life with the man you love.

267
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,030
A life, a life, just a life.

268
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,680
You're not married, correct?

269
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,760
No.

270
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,650
Girlfriend?

271
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,050
- No.
 - Boyfriend?

272
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,900
- Husband, please.
 - Fuck you.

273
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:45,190
No, no boyfriend.

274
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,260
Would you like someone
 special in your life?

275
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,300
Doesn't everyone?

276
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,100
So is your life working?

277
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,570
My life is not so bad.

278
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,080
So why are you here?

279
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,440
OK, my life sucks.

280
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,200
My life's a fucking nightmare.

281
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,930
Enough?

282
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,630
DR. APSEY: No.

283
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:01,750
Why?

284
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,620
Because.

285
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,560
Because-- because
 I may have tend--

286
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:13,360
because I have tendencies that
 may be-- that are homosexual.

287
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,840
I maybe kind of
 sort of messed up.

288
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,100
Instead of forcing
 him to use the word,

289
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,760
the session became
 about me not saying it.

290
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:39,990
So, you know, giving him what
 he wants, I said homosexual.

291
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,910
Fag seemed too hostile.

292
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:45,200
Gay, too neutral.

293
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,830
He certainly wouldn't
 understand the subtleties

294
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,450
of the word queer.

295
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:53,310
I don't understand the
 subtleties of the word queer.

296
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:56,880
FRANK: Basic homophobia
 101 theories.

297
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,780
He manipulated you into
 saying the dreaded H word.

298
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:02,250
You won't be able to
 cope with the truth.

299
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:04,140
So you'll sink into
 self-destructive behavior,

300
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,000
the way we all do
 when we're faced

301
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,600
with our sick, twisted selves.

302
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,460
Drink yourself
 into oblivion, have

303
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,360
a few unsafe anonymous
 fucks in filthy places, rape

304
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,910
a couple of blind
 handicapped, 10-year-old boys.

305
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,740
You know, the usual thing.

306
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:24,190
So next week, you make
 up some gooey experience,

307
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,330
so he can convince you what
 a twisted worm of a man you

308
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,000
are and pull you out
 of the homosexual muck

309
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,740
and into a blissful
 heterosexual life

310
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,670
where the sun always shines.

311
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,560
What do you mean make up?

312
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,960
You want to see the
 monster's methods?

313
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,220
You got to give
 him what he wants.

314
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,550
Talk dirty to him.

315
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,310
I wouldn't do that.

316
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,560
That's not my experience.

317
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
Not me.

318
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,620
The me in his office, that
 me wouldn't talk dirty.

319
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,550
So talk clean, but the
 extracurricular activities,

320
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,440
very, very dirty.

321
00:15:53,440 --> 00:16:00,240
So if you were to, you
 know, what would it be?

322
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,750
Sex in bushes?

323
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,140
No, I-- I told him
 I don't like that.

324
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,140
Perfect.

325
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,990
He assumes you're lying and
 you have a frequent bush

326
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,700
pass for the park.

327
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,300
No.

328
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,480
I'd never have anonymous sex.

329
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,430
I'd-- uh--
 - What?

330
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,800
No.

331
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,640
What?

332
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,700
Tell me.

333
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:32,310
Um-- uh-- a huge club
 with pitch black room.

334
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,010
There's lots of men.

335
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,580
And there's-- there's
 lots of wandering hands.

336
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,110
A relentless army of hungry
 hands, smothering my body.

337
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,390
Pinching fingers,
 probing tongues.

338
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,140
So sticky, so wet.

339
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,400
You seem to have given
 this a lot of thought.

340
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,240
Uh, huh.

341
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:54,250
So that's what you'll
 tell Frankenstein next week.

342
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,200
Yeah, but I've never been.

343
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,860
He'll know I'm making it up.

344
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,650
OK.

345
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,760
Club Phuque-- P-H-U-Q-U-E, cute.

346
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,060
Group scenes, role playing,
 fetish attire required.

347
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,330
Open seven days, 10:00 to 4:00,
 refreshments, nonsmoking rooms.

348
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,710
Yeah?

349
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,660
Well, if you can't
 fabricate, then fornicate.

350
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,410
Go to a sex club.

351
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,680
Do whatever.

352
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,070
Safe only, of course.

353
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,130
And you got a nice
 non-fabricated experience

354
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:35,830
to tell Frankenstein.

355
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,840
I can't believe you want me
 to have sex with another guy.

356
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,540
I don't.

357
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,490
I want you to

358
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,670
If we stop one guy from
 going to this quack,

359
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,580
you've saved a life.

360
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,600
God, I hate when
 you do this, Jonathan.

361
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,250
If I were good fag,
 I'd protest with you

362
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,710
at every new cause de jour.

363
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,670
If I were a good
 fag, I'd yell louder.

364
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,020
If every a good fag, I'd
 throw condoms at the pope.

365
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,600
I can do what you want,
 which makes me the good fag.

366
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,160
I can not do what
 you want, which

367
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,700
makes me an unenlightened,
 apolitical, fucking piece

368
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,960
of selfish shit.

369
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,840
It's OK for you to
 contradict that.

370
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,340
What's wrong with
 being a good fag?

371
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,270
It's not wrong.

372
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,370
It's just-- it's
 very, very hard.

373
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:37,590
OK, exactly what
 sort of depravities

374
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,430
do you want me to make up?

375
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,680
My name is Franklin
 Johnston, and I

376
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,220
am a writer, freelance writer.

377
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,320
Nice to meet you all.

378
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,540
I didn't actually make the
 choice to go see Dr. Apsey.

379
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,840
It was planned experiments.

380
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,010
I went somewhere last
 night, only to watch.

381
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,390
I wasn't going to
 take off any clothes,

382
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:12,140
but everything got taken off.

383
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,050
I guess, there wasn't
 much of a fight.

384
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,640
How many times?
 How many individuals?

385
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,990
I don't know.

386
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:25,360
I woke up 6:00 AM,
 was naked, curled

387
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,170
up on a damp, concrete floor.

388
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,920
Found a pair of jeans, soaked,
 not mine, and shirt, mine,

389
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,680
but covered in, you
 know, ew, so I left it.

390
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,770
Walked home shirtless,
 shoeless, soulless.

391
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,260
And you undertook
 this excursion because?

392
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,180
Last week you said, say it,
 say it, say it, say the word.

393
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,430
So I said it, faggot.

394
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,320
And I acted like a faggot.

395
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,360
All male organisms
 in your situation

396
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,520
don't engage in such behavior.

397
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,250
You-- you pushed me.

398
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,430
Me?

399
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:10,520
Have you ever succumbed
 to anonymous sex before?

400
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,390
Don't remember.

401
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,100
Frank, your lapses of
 memory consistently occur at

402
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,620
ridiculously convenient times.

403
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,400
Say, yes.

404
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,980
Yeah, I guess I've
 done that stuff.

405
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,010
Were we acquainted
 during his past exploits?

406
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:24,710
FRANK: No.

407
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,040
So were these previous
 encounters because of me?

408
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,740
Of course not.

409
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,510
Then who caused you
 to have anonymous sex

410
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,440
these other times?

411
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,460
Whoever.

412
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,510
Your editor.

413
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,290
My boss.

414
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,070
I got fired.

415
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,120
When you were fired,
 what were you feeling?

416
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,140
How do I know?

417
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,300
Do I look like a keep a diary?

418
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,220
Upset, angry, humiliated.

419
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,420
FRANK: All of the above.

420
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,870
Last week when we verbalized
 the word, you all of the above?

421
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,650
Yeah, exactly.

422
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,130
DR. APSEY: So both times, you
 were angry, upset, humiliated,

423
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:51,880
and what did you do?

424
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:57,030
Fucked.

425
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,680
I fucked.

426
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,440
So for five fucking
 seconds I could fucking

427
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,360
forget who I fucking was.

428
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,270
So who caused you
 to have anonymous sex?

429
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,880
Don't take the blame.

430
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,770
You-- and my ex-boss.

431
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,860
DR. APSEY: You had
 nothing to do with it?

432
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,370
Look, slap my
 knuckles or something.

433
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,410
Let's get on with this.

434
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,150
To punish you?

435
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,340
Last week, you specifically
 requested I refrain

436
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,310
from punishment techniques.

437
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,310
This week you're wanting them.

438
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,220
Make up your mind.

439
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,750
He's putting
 words in your mouth.

440
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:24,920
You're putting
 words in my mouth.

441
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,870
I am concerned you view
 me as a disciplinarian.

442
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,420
And your activities
 the other night

443
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,850
were rebellion against me.

444
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,120
Well, no real guy
 likes some other guy

445
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,240
telling him what to do.

446
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,990
DR. APSEY: Did I ever
 tell you no sex club?

447
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,520
My mind's not a tape recorder.

448
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,260
Mine is.

449
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,110
I've never mentioned sex, not
 the word, not the activity.

450
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,250
You're rebelling against
 the rule I never made.

451
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,200
So why did you assume
 you shouldn't have sex?

452
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,070
Well, duh, that's
 why I'm here.

453
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,530
DR. APSEY: Then you've created
 the no sex rule, no me.

454
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:00,050
Perhaps you shouldn't be
 so demanding of yourself.

455
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:03,440
I should do exactly
 what I'm trying not to.

456
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,410
I will never tell you
 whether or not to be sexual.

457
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,380
But, Frank, desires exist.

458
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,960
Repression always
 fails miserably.

459
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,570
Healthy sex is
 not an anesthetic.

460
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,120
Mature adult sex
 connects to feelings.

461
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,420
If that's easier with a
 man, practice with a man.

462
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,100
I'd prefer you build
 an emotionally healthy

463
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,680
relationship with a man,
 than have anesthetized sex

464
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,670
with men or women.

465
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:34,170
Well, even Frankenstein
 has his surprises.

466
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,860
I'm-- I'm--

467
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,200
I'm-- I'm surprised.

468
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,270
I have a confession to make.

469
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:48,280
That story about the
 sex club, I made it up.

470
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,980
Oh.

471
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,720
Why this lie?

472
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,000
FRANK: A friend put me up to it.

473
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,500
Frank, I'm going
 to piss in my pants.

474
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,480
To see if you'd pee
 your pants or anything.

475
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,300
Pleasantly, it's been
 quite a while since I've

476
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,150
lost bladder control.

477
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,650
Perhaps there's a better
 therapist for you.

478
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,390
Great, now you see
 what you've done.

479
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,590
I'd be happy to
 recommend a few.

480
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,920
- OK.
 - No.

481
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,640
- No.
 - You view me as your enemy.

482
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,780
Ask to stay.

483
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,560
Please let me stay.

484
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,690
Have you noticed a
 pattern to our sessions?

485
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,500
You lie.

486
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,280
You stumble.

487
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,880
You reluctantly come clean.

488
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,230
He wants an apology.

489
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:35,950
I'm sorry.

490
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,230
Sorry isn't worth doo doo.

491
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,100
FRANK: Please, please,
 please, let me stay.

492
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,020
The pain you
 radiate blinds me.

493
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,350
I'm a sucker for pain.

494
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:01,900
You may stay, if you stop lying
 and begin with coming clean.

495
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,510
It saves time.
 It saves energy.

496
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:07,160
It saves me pissing my pants.

497
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,520
Agreed?

498
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,980
Thank you.

499
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,840
Now, homework for the week.

500
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,700
No lying.

501
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,140
Lying is toxic.

502
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,820
It's time to develop
 healthier habits.

503
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:22,270
And the truth is a
 spiffy habit to get into.

504
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,190
He was lying, but his--

505
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:28,980
his lies, by his own admission
 after a while, were very--

506
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,770
were thin veneer.

507
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,720
It became very complicated.

508
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,040
Well, you have all the records.

509
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,990
So truth is a very
 important factor in my life.

510
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,880
I would like to
 give all my patients

511
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,970
the benefit of the doubt.

512
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:44,280
I mean, people lie.

513
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,230
I guess you could
 label anything a lie.

514
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,800
But people are just
 afraid of the truth.

515
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,070
And that's as clearly
 as I can put it.

516
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,150
I don't know.

517
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:54,910
I don't know.

518
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,680
I don't know.

519
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,400
I don't know why told him
 the sex club was a lie.

520
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,390
Maybe it's his eyes.

521
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:04,550
They suck words outta me
 and everything backfires.

522
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,720
He's supposed to tell me
 I'm bad and he doesn't.

523
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,200
Well, what is he going to say?

524
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,520
You know, good
 afternoon, you're bad.

525
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,480
Please pay me $150 an
 hour to destroy your life.

526
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,030
He's supposed to
 punish me, but he won't.

527
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,520
He knows that you
 don't trust him.

528
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,220
So he expresses compassion
 to keep you off balance.

529
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,570
He's supposed to
 hate my guts, but I

530
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,860
think he actually likes me.

531
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,530
I can't deal with him liking me.

532
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,470
Because you like him?

533
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,940
You are way off.

534
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,520
Clients are frequently
 attracted to their therapists.

535
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,710
Are you?
 You're crazy.

536
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,890
I've seen him at conferences.

537
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:38,660
He's not bad looking.

538
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,850
You know, if he
 were my therapist,

539
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:42,190
I might sport a woody.

540
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:45,420
You're oversharing.

541
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,080
Look, I'm having
 a really bad day.

542
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,390
And it would be really
 nice if you would just

543
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:53,340
zip up your deliciously
 oversized mouth, nod your head,

544
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,650
mutter a few
 therapist's uh, huhs,

545
00:25:54,650 --> 00:26:00,040
and never use the phrase
 sport a woody again.

546
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,430
Jonathan, what if I can't?

547
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,780
I mean, it's not
 exactly like I've never

548
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,070
done a piece like this before.

549
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,010
Uh, huh.

550
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,600
Is that a therapist uh, huh?

551
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,810
I aim to please.

552
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:14,980
Jonathan.

553
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,610
You're a good writer.

554
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,980
I'm a writer, not a reporter.

555
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,680
Who am I kidding?

556
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,280
I write about tulip festivals
 and antique shows and fall

557
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,030
colors.

558
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,170
But an expose?

559
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,220
What if I'm in over my head?

560
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,800
Then you will rise
 and meet this challenge.

561
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,520
Same way you've risen
 and met every challenge

562
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,480
I've ever seen you face.

563
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,350
I have complete confidence
 in your ability.

564
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,150
You know what?

565
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,950
What?

566
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,250
I have an uncontrollable
 desire to kiss you.

567
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,860
Wow.

568
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,950
That is friggin freaky.

569
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,680
I'm experiencing the same
 uncontrollable desire.

570
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,300
Oops.

571
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,360
What?

572
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,440
The uncontrollable
 desire, it's spreading.

573
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,710
Oh, you have uncontrollable
 desire to kiss my nose?

574
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:06,840
Yeah.
 That all right?

575
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,780
Yeah, that's all right.

576
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,900
Oops, your earlobe,
 can I kiss it too?

577
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,560
- Yeah, I guess so.
 - Oops.

578
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,360
The bulging bag
 underneath my left eye.

579
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,600
How did you know?

580
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,630
Faggot intuition.

581
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:25,070
OK, before you completely
 lose site of the fact

582
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:32,270
that we are in a public place,
 Jonathan, I respect you.

583
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,460
You're always right
 there, front line.

584
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,430
That's why they call me
 super fag, faster than a speed

585
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,870
dial phone tree, able to leaflet
 entire malls in a single bound.

586
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,570
Exactly.

587
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:48,200
But it's not that I'm not
 sure if I can pull this off,

588
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,740
but I'm not sure--

589
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,650
I'm kind of thinking--

590
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,100
feeling I maybe sort
 of don't want to.

591
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:03,390
Well, and you don't want
 to, you don't want to, right?

592
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,450
Wants change, right?

593
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,050
Wants change all the time.

594
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:17,130
I mean really all the time,
 like-- like when you wanted

595
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,710
to manage our investments,
 instead of hiring

596
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,230
a professional, except it
 turned out that it was harder

597
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,300
than you thought, so you quit.

598
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,710
We ended up with a 1% return
 instead of 10 or more.

599
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,050
Oh, when you wanted
 to make extra money

600
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,990
with that multi-level
 marketing craziness,

601
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,030
except it was more time
 consuming than you thought.

602
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:33,900
So you quit.

603
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,890
We ended up with 100 gallons of
 mud mask and a tax write-off.

604
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,130
Or whatever.

605
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,030
You know-- you know,
 you go half way.

606
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:45,180
Wants change and you bail.

607
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,250
I step aside and I
 let you self-sabotage

608
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,690
because it is your life.

609
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,950
And it's usually only money.

610
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:52,740
But this time it's more.

611
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,810
So grow a backbone.

612
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:56,230
Visualize manhood.

613
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,570
Pretend you have a brain.

614
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,790
But under no
 circumstances, drop out.

615
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,920
Why don't you tell me
 what you really think?

616
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,820
Sorry.

617
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,620
Sorry, sorry.

618
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,990
I'm not allowed needs and
 I'm not allowed concerns?

619
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:07,860
Yes, of course, you are.

620
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,820
Tell me your concerns.

621
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,720
Oh, eat it.

622
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,460
If I go back, I do.

623
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,460
And if I don't, I don't.

624
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,410
Well, you're going back.

625
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,630
You are going back.

626
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,600
[DOORBELL RINGING]

627
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,020
JONATHAN: The actual idea
 of Mr. Johnston posing

628
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,970
as a client of Dr. Apsey's, I--

629
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,000
I was not involved in.

630
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,500
It was Dr. Baldwin's
 idea for me to--

631
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,910
to go under cover.

632
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:40,210
Prior to the
 events in question,

633
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,870
no, I wasn't even
 aware of Dr. Baldwin.

634
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:47,220
As Mr. Johnston
 is a reporter, I--

635
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,180
it was not my place to
 decide whether or not

636
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:53,080
it was within the bounds
 of his professional ethics.

637
00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:00,730
It's not my responsibility
 to make that decision.

638
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,440
DR. APSEY: How was
 your lie-free week?

639
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,690
Difficult.

640
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:10,270
DR. APSEY: Perhaps you'll
 share how difficult.

641
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:12,310
Listen, I can't-- um--

642
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,360
do this today.

643
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,160
I'll pay you.

644
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,080
And therapy may be
 a beneficial place

645
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,570
to share these difficulties.

646
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,140
I can't talk about
 not lying, because I'd

647
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,370
have to lie to do it.

648
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:28,000
DR. APSEY: You're more
 comfortable with falsehood

649
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,490
than truth.

650
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:32,980
But changing patterns
 is why you're here.

651
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,180
You don't have to
 have sex with men.

652
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,530
That's the big step.

653
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:39,110
Take a small step today.

654
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:42,660
Earn a couple bonus
 therapy points.

655
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,360
Tell the truth.

656
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:50,010
The friend I told
 you about last week,

657
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:54,600
the one who convinced me
 to lie about the sex club,

658
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,940
he's not a friend.

659
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,880
Well, not, of course,
 he's a friend,

660
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,450
but a friend I kind of
 sort of have a thing with.

661
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:05,580
DR. APSEY: I assumed.

662
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,890
Now this man, what
 should I call him?

663
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,520
His name is Jonathan.

664
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,350
DR. APSEY: And how is not
 lying connected to Jonathan?

665
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,910
Sometimes he wants
 me to do things

666
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,890
I'm not sure I want to do.

667
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:22,830
Sexual things?

668
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:26,040
Personal things.

669
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,800
True friends don't push.
 FRANK: Yeah.

670
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,790
He's a therapist, too.

671
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,140
I mean he should
 know better, right?

672
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,130
A therapist?

673
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,830
Exactly, what's he
 been pushing you to do?

674
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,740
I know you know I
 have to lied to you.

675
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,390
It's not only to
 you, everywhere.

676
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,660
Every crack in my life I
 putty with a lie out of habit

677
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,360
to survive, because
 day in and day out,

678
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,030
I got the not so
 subliminal message

679
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:09,710
that I was sick or defective
 or pathetic, because I couldn't

680
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,390
hammer in the nail
 with a single pound,

681
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,980
or my handshake
 wasn't firm enough,

682
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:16,040
or I couldn't do the 42 push-ups
 that the Presidential Fitness

683
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,520
Test said I should
 be able to do.

684
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,540
And I knew that something was
 very, very, very wrong with me,

685
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,630
because whenever there was
 a neighbor or a postman

686
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:27,260
or a waiter who had that certain
 je ne sais quois, you know,

687
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,470
that certain gent
 don't want to say qua.

688
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,440
My dad would say that man's
 a little light on his feet.

689
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,360
And it scared me,
 because somehow I knew

690
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,650
that je ne sais quois was moi.

691
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:40,580
So another day passed when my
 dad wasn't embarrassed by me,

692
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,290
and he didn't know why
 except that in the tiniest

693
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,060
corner of his brain I
 spoke with a voice so soft

694
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,640
he never listened.

695
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,210
And I would do something wrong.

696
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,200
I would do something.

697
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,510
Dad would hit me on the face.
 Hit me.

698
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,100
Not a slap.

699
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,150
But fingers,
 definitely fingers hit,

700
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:57,020
curled with the fist
 hit on the face.

701
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,320
And Mom would try to stop it.

702
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,130
Stop, stop, stop, she'd yell.

703
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,510
But words didn't work.

704
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:04,730
So she hit me first.

705
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,860
You know, softer,
 kinder, gentler smack.

706
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,040
Because she figured if she
 hit first, then he wouldn't.

707
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,440
But the problem
 was-- the problem

708
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,640
was she grew to like hitting,
 because the power over me

709
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,850
was the only power she had.

710
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,090
And then they'd fight.
 It's my turn.

711
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:16,830
Then they'd fight.

712
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,920
No, it's my turn.

713
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,560
Honey, I think your
 turn was yesterday.

714
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,880
No, I don't think I
 would have every given

715
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,520
him that black of an eye, dear.

716
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,790
And because I
 caused this fight--

717
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:28,140
because I caused this fight,
 they'd both just gang up on me.

718
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,250
It glued their
 marriage together.

719
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,890
No, stop it.

720
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,860
Stop it.

721
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:41,120
Frank, stop, stop, stop, stop.

722
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,500
I'm sorry.

723
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,650
I'm so sorry.

724
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:16,550
OK, this is the truthful truth.

725
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:26,080
Mom and dad never
 hit me physically,

726
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,770
but they hit me with words.

727
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:32,070
They hit me with criticism.

728
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:41,250
They hit me with the
 disappointment festering

729
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,210
in their fearful eyes.

730
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:50,850
And I though I must be very,
 very, very bad to make them

731
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,550
judge.

732
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,450
I figured if I lied,
 they wouldn't see me,

733
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,770
and they couldn't reject me.

734
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,650
And it continues even today,
 no matter how much money I make

735
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,710
or how many articles
 they publish--

736
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,130
I'm-- I'm a--
 I'm a writer.

737
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,240
Did I tell you I was a writer?

738
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,780
I feel inadequate.

739
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,740
And when Jonathan suggested
 writing an expose,

740
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:35,280
I thought, wow, that's a
 serious piece of journalism.

741
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,320
It could fix me.

742
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,590
And I said, yes, yes,
 yes, save me from myself.

743
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:46,940
So I came to be saved, but
 not by you, by this article.

744
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,910
But then you surprised me.

745
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:06,270
You helped me taste clean.

746
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,210
I-- hey, I still get
 those bonus points?

747
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,990
FRANK: Say something.

748
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,990
Hate me.

749
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,120
Hit me.

750
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:41,290
Rip me a second asshole
 and scream, fuck you,

751
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:42,400
fuck you, fuck you.

752
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,010
These options
 you have suggested,

753
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,180
many have crossed my mind.

754
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,120
But life ultimately is about
 self-control, isn't it?

755
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,870
So before I lose my
 professional tolerance

756
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:01,760
and those options seem
 viable, you'd better go.

757
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,900
DR. APSEY: Notice my tone.

758
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,970
The low timbre and
 even modulation

759
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,850
indicate I'm not posing a
 question or an invitation.

760
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:28,580
An order, now go.

761
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,810
Are you expecting ugliness?

762
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,800
To see my anger?

763
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,180
I'm afraid I'll have
 to disappoint you.

764
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,070
I just--

765
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:48,410
I just want to interview
 you, include your side.

766
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,240
Continue.

767
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,340
I'm going to
 write this article

768
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,910
with or without
 your cooperation.

769
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,400
I prefer it to be with.

770
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,980
DR. APSEY: Why?

771
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,990
Professionalism.

772
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:09,750
Professionalism hasn't been
 a major force in your behavior.

773
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:12,770
No, I guess not, but I
 was talked into some things

774
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,270
I wish I hadn't been.

775
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:18,280
How many times have
 you lied since we've met?

776
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,710
DR. APSEY: The question
 was not rhetorical.

777
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,310
An exact number please.

778
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:23,020
I don't know--

779
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,990
DR. APSEY: Then estimate.

780
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,590
Six times.

781
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,520
A conservative estimate.

782
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,160
Oh, all right, six.

783
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,030
And not white lies, but
 six malevolent falsehoods.

784
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,040
I didn't have to tell
 you I was a writer.

785
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,010
I could have-- could have
 continued this game if all

786
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,010
I wanted was to trap you.

787
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,010
I don't.

788
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:44,850
I suppose so.

789
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:46,380
You're not the first
 client who lied to me.

790
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,870
Well, when they lie about their
 names, you know it's hopeless.

791
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,730
Let me see your
 driver's license.

792
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,480
DR. APSEY: I promise, I
 won't laugh at your photo.

793
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,780
[LAUGHING]

794
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,420
Franklin Johnston.

795
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:21,450
Well, Mr. Johnston, you want
 to interview me from my side.

796
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:23,020
It's a delicate dilemma.

797
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,640
To consent to an
 interview with a client

798
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,850
would clearly be an
 inappropriate dualistic

799
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:34,150
relationship, yet in reality
 you never were a client,

800
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:39,540
so perhaps I'll give your
 proposal serious consideration.

801
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,810
Now go.

802
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:45,460
I know sorry
 isn't worth doo-doo,

803
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,590
but please accept my apology.

804
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,390
I'm a therapist, not a saint.
 Now go.

805
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,760
- Hi, sorry I'm late.
 - Hey.

806
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,460
Subway's a mess.

807
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,790
Hey, champagne.

808
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,510
What's the occasion?

809
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,360
Listen, I'm sorry.

810
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:07,710
Meetings, protests,
 fundraisers, I love that life.

811
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:09,540
You go along with
 me sometimes I think

812
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,510
just to earn good fag points--

813
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,400
like I dole them out.

814
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,740
I promise, never
 again will I pressure

815
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,050
you to be more political.

816
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,330
You're free, poof.

817
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,810
You don't want to write
 this article, it's OK.

818
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:25,110
I'll find someone else.

819
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:27,570
Thanks.
 - Thank you.

820
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,790
Jonathan, it's
 just the pretending

821
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,630
I'm uncomfortable with.

822
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,200
I think I want to
 be above board.

823
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,790
You know, tell him
 I'm a writer and do

824
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:55,550
a straightforward interview.

825
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,660
Like he would go along.

826
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,520
And even if I, trusting
 him what he says,

827
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,930
the only way to
 get the truth is--

828
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,090
Is by lying.

829
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,390
Get the fat free.

830
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,960
If he knows you're a
 reporter, he's never going

831
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,540
to give you honest information.

832
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,320
Well, I hope you're
 wrong, because-- uh--

833
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,430
Frank.

834
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,660
OK, Jonathan, just don't flip.
 OK?

835
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,890
Frank, tell me you didn't.

836
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,520
I kind of sort of did.

837
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,480
Frank.

838
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,190
Frank!

839
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,350
What on earth were you thinking?

840
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:29,050
I don't know.

841
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,060
I just can't go
 through with this.

842
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,810
- After all our planning--
 - Your planning--

843
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:33,530
You sabotage--

844
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:34,830
Choosing not to do
 something your way

845
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:36,210
isn't the same as sabotage.

846
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,020
Whatever.
 Fine.

847
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,250
It's over.

848
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,630
There'll never be
 an article now.

849
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,910
Oh, grow up.

850
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,080
Total honesty here.

851
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,410
Hey, just say it.

852
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,480
You don't think I'm good enough.

853
00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:00,210
Asking you to go
 undercover was a mistake.

854
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:02,840
If-- if I always go half
 way, it's because you--

855
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,340
you-- you build me up.
 You can do it.

856
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,040
You can do it.

857
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,560
Then you shut me down
 with your doubts.

858
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,710
OK, no more halfway.

859
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:10,380
When this article comes out,
 I'll be saying I told you so,

860
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,450
I told you so, I told
 you so, until you're

861
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:14,760
investing in earplug stocks.

862
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,680
I very much look forward
 to you proving me wrong.

863
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,330
I believe that Dr. Apsey
 approach and the basis

864
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,660
of his psychotherapy
 is unethical,

865
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:31,840
inappropriate, immoral, as
 well as perhaps malpractice.

866
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,810
His use of language
 is very powerful.

867
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:39,370
He-- he comes across as
 sounding quite logical.

868
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:45,040
I did not realize that
 Dr. Apsey would manipulate

869
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,010
Mr. Johnston to such a degree.

870
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:50,050
Of course, he was in a
 dilemma, because he was talking

871
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:52,840
about someone he
 loved, he cared for,

872
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:57,870
but who I feel was
 using him unfairly.

873
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:03,150
DR. APSEY: To let or not
 to let one never truly

874
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:07,800
was a client, i.e. you,
 interview me for a potentially

875
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,950
career threatening
 article, the roughly four

876
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:15,300
inch by four inch area
 beneath my solar plexus

877
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:18,810
currently is experiencing a
 not negligible inflammation,

878
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:22,140
commonly labeled caution.

879
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:27,910
My caution encourages
 me to say N-O.

880
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:30,910
The 4.1 pounds above my neck--

881
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:33,520
the average male brain
 is actually 3.1 pounds.

882
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,030
I hope you'll excuse me for
 being a smidgen overgenerous.

883
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,450
I'm feeling rather vulnerable.

884
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:43,150
My brain assures me I have
 nothing to lose by cooperating.

885
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:45,280
You'll write the article,
 with or without my input.

886
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,440
If you lie, you lie.

887
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,640
If you tell the truth, I can
 only gain from an interview.

888
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,430
The single path to
 victory is to step aside.

889
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,410
As the history of
 humanity and inhumanity

890
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,540
clearly demonstrates,
 stepping aside

891
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:01,570
is, of course, much more
 difficult than loading a gun

892
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,800
and shooting it.

893
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,600
How to step aside, make
 the correct decision,

894
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,600
I have no earthly idea.

895
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,420
And you're telling
 me this, because--

896
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,970
Ah, my analogy eludes you.

897
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:26,650
Then I'll try again in a
 more simple vernacular.

898
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,410
You like Oprah?

899
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,190
Sure.

900
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,220
Who doesn't?

901
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:30,930
I wouldn't know.

902
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:32,360
Her people phone me.

903
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,060
I decline.

904
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,400
Talk shows expect
 you to be combative.

905
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,680
I'm not.
 They expect you to be defensive.

906
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:38,940
I'm not.

907
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,500
They expect you to
 be charming and have

908
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,360
a sublime ability to banter.

909
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,590
Well, OK.

910
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:51,030
But honesty and integrity aren't
 assets during a ratings sweep.

911
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,860
Do you find my condescension
 of television arrogant?

912
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,830
Extremely.

913
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:57,360
But not unjustified.

914
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:58,830
I'm pleased we see eye to eye.

915
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,990
Now, you must elucidate.

916
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,440
Why would a wise organism
 trust the print media

917
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,190
more than the electronic media?

918
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:12,640
So why did you
 ask me here today?

919
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,190
You've initiated a game
 I'm powerless to terminate.

920
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:17,110
So I intend to win.

921
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:19,150
You and I are
 not in opposition.

922
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,470
No?

923
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,530
If I refuse your interview,
 what will your article say.

924
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:30,280
Uh-- I'd say you're a kind
 hearted man who's misguided

925
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,820
in his attempts to change us.

926
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,800
Oh, as I suspected.

927
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,790
You'd invalidate me and my work,
 yet we're not in opposition.

928
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:39,670
Then you are naive, which
 benefits me tremendously.

929
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,860
I'll win much more easily.

930
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,960
Now, you've unfairly
 labeled me as misguided.

931
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,640
How can I prove otherwise?

932
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,780
Prove your therapy works.

933
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,330
DR. APSEY: Prove it doesn't.
 - That is not my--

934
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,620
Why not?

935
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:53,710
Your Dr. Baldwin in his fancy
 office claims I'm a fraud.

936
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,780
Do you ask him for proof?
 No.

937
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,160
Because what?

938
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,260
He cooks you dinner,
 warms your bed.

939
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,850
So his assertions
 go unchallenged.

940
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:01,720
You know his last name?

941
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,540
How?

942
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,740
Oh, I've done a dollop
 of research this past week.

943
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:08,470
Your community is small
 and quite talkative.

944
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:10,210
Information equals strength.

945
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:13,040
I intend to play your game
 from a position of strength.

946
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,770
And you've certainly
 gone out of your way

947
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:17,970
to let me know this.

948
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:20,220
I wonder, does a man
 secure in his strength

949
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,690
go out of his way to
 reveal how strong he is?

950
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:27,640
I like you, Mr. Johnston.

951
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:31,870
Next question.

952
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,030
OK, why this type of work?

953
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,370
DR. APSEY: If I weren't
 so terribly shy,

954
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:42,930
I'd put it in a brochure.

955
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:45,220
People ask me so frequently.

956
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:57,380
My younger brother was
 similar to you, my clients.

957
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:01,840
I thought, I don't
 care who cares.

958
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,300
It turned out he cared.

959
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,220
I was 19.

960
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,260
I was away at college.

961
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,940
One day I received
 a letter from him

962
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:19,390
using the corner of a razor
 blade as a pen and his blood

963
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:21,550
as ink.

964
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:24,440
He wrote, "I won't
 live this way.

965
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,140
I'm sorry."

966
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,010
When my clients frustrate
 me, I think of my brother.

967
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:36,790
OK.

968
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:43,450
And how do I know
 this really happened?

969
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,230
Here, I'll show you
 the blood drenched

970
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:48,400
letter I carry in my wallet.

971
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,920
I'm sorry, gay
 teen kills self.

972
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,380
It's very tragic.

973
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,690
It's also very convenient.

974
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,560
A dead brother motivating
 you to save the poor gay men

975
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,140
from killing themselves.

976
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,670
I am so thoroughly
 pleased you were never

977
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,920
a client, because now
 I have complete freedom

978
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,980
to say fuck you.

979
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,090
Fuck you.

980
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:15,280
Fuck you.

981
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,350
Heavens, fuck is a lovely word.

982
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:20,980
I'll have to remember to
 use it more frequently.

983
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,730
Is your outburst
 intended to distract

984
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:23,810
from the question of proof?

985
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:32,780
March 23, 1971, his
 obituary two days later.

986
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:39,860
Morton, Illinois, "Morton
 Herald," Adam Apsey.

987
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,200
You want proof, do
 your own research.

988
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:41,900
Next question.

989
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,000
Oh, I need to
 interview your clients

990
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,810
who supposedly succeeded.

991
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:53,910
DR. APSEY: I
 guarantee my clients

992
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:56,220
complete confidentiality.

993
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,870
That's a convenient rule.

994
00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:00,270
Oh, I suppose your Dr. Baldwin
 has allowed you to interview

995
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,220
those clients he stole from me?
 - Jonathan--

996
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,080
Do I detect surprise?

997
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:06,240
Has he never informed you
 that stealing my clients

998
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,840
is his favorite pastime?

999
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,980
Your clients?

1000
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:12,630
If you won't let
 me talk to them,

1001
00:49:12,630 --> 00:49:14,860
then all I have is your
 opinion that they've changed.

1002
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,980
And if you spoke with
 them, would you believe them

1003
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,360
or insist I brainwashed them?

1004
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,950
FRANK: Some people
 would say that, yes.

1005
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:21,450
Yes, some people.

1006
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:23,190
Attack dogs, really.

1007
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:25,980
They bark and growl simply
 because my clients had

1008
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,500
the courage to assume
 control of their lives

1009
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,750
and change themselves
 to find happiness.

1010
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,880
While these some
 people are wallowing

1011
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,770
in pain over the
 same sexual behaviors

1012
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:36,120
they're waving
 their flags about.

1013
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,220
I'm not in pain
 over my sexuality.

1014
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,230
Did I say you?

1015
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:43,360
That's your inference, not mine.

1016
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,670
Of course, now that
 you mention it,

1017
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:47,460
anonymous sex, followed by
 guilt ridden drunken binges--

1018
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,480
That wasn't me.

1019
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,440
I made it up.

1020
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,450
Oh, made that up means
 your subconscious mind

1021
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,460
is barking louder
 than your conscious,

1022
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,840
which mind hardly matters.

1023
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,940
As you've pointed out,
 I'm not your client.

1024
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:59,220
So don't try to
 psychoanalyze me.

1025
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:00,930
I'm here in a
 professional capacity.

1026
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:02,490
How professional?

1027
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:05,150
How determined are you to
 find out if my therapy works.

1028
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:05,910
FRANK: Very.

1029
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,860
Only one way, go
 through the process.

1030
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,480
You change, you'll know.

1031
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,890
Not possible.

1032
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:13,800
Well, then Mr. Professional
 has a professional dilemma.

1033
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,070
To write my therapy
 works, you need proof.

1034
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:18,600
The only way to
 obtain such proof

1035
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,370
is to experience the process.

1036
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:22,950
Yet if you write my
 therapy doesn't work,

1037
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,940
you'll know you
 failed to test it.

1038
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,360
How unprofessional.

1039
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:31,650
Don't mind fuck me, doctor.

1040
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:34,080
Hardly my style, mister.

1041
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,640
I'm merely encouraging
 in you a professionalism.

1042
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,030
I know you possess.

1043
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:42,140
I've been to the library
 to sample your articles.

1044
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:45,090
Would you rise above the tulips?

1045
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:47,130
The world is filled
 with weak organisms.

1046
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:48,130
Don't be one of them.

1047
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:57,680
I didn't steal
 Frankenstein clients.

1048
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,460
Some of his clients
 chose to see me.

1049
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,090
I think you'd be
 happy, now upset.

1050
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:03,800
I'm not upset.

1051
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,580
You seem upset.

1052
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,200
I'm not upset you're
 seeing his clients.

1053
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,690
I'm upset you didn't tell me.

1054
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,730
I never discuss
 my clients with you.

1055
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:15,560
Corners, please.

1056
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,390
This is different.

1057
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,640
You've got men who've
 been through his process.

1058
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,810
I need to interview them.

1059
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,660
I can't encourage my clients
 to talk to a reporter--

1060
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,630

They're too vulnerable.

00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,870
Would it hurt to ask?

1063
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:27,590
Yes.

before I write he's a fraud.

The proof would be
 sitting in your lap

00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,800
if you hadn't told him
 you were a reporter--

You won't let me
 talk to your clients.

What do you expect me to do?
 - Nothing.

Me involving you to keep my name
 out of it was just cowardly.

I'm going to the board
 to file a complaint.

1076
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,160
What he's doing is worse
 than just unethical.

1077
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,750
It's malpractice.

1078
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,690
And if there's any justice,
 he'll lose his license.

1079
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:08,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
 you file a complaint,

00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,080

he'll ever talk to me again?

So what?

1084

It matters to me.

Gee, gosh darn it, I tell her,
 good thing you're a saint.

1113
00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:54,590
Your question?

1114
00:53:54,590 --> 00:54:01,880
Ah, yes, one, is same sex
 behavior a clinical pathology?

1115
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,090
No, merely undesirable.

1116
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:07,320
Heterosexual behavior
 is the superior choice.

1117
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,470
Question two, would or
 could I force a male organism

1118
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:15,380
to change his sexual behavior?

1119
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:18,460
Never, your process only
 works on voluntary participants.

1120
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:21,910
Question three, is
 same-sex sex natural?

1121
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:28,530
Homosexual behavior
 occurs across many cultures.

1122
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:30,210
But so what?

1123
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,350
In every society, human
 beings kill one another.

1124
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:33,720
Does that make murder natural?

1125
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,930
If so, then nature is
 terribly overrated.

00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:40,110
Congratulations, Mr. Johnston,
 you understand my theories

1127
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,010

Excuse me for being personal.

Why write such an unlikely
 article in the first place?

1134
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:01,590
Why spew such
 poorly crafted lies?

00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:03,030

 to provide their names

would have stopped a
 more determined reporter.

00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:17,040
And why today have you
 no new questions, when

1142
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,200
if I were writing the article,
 the most important questions

1143
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,300
I'd have are still unanswered?

1144
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,760
The only answer that makes
 any sense is what you want,

1145
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,630
you won't admit.

1146
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,930
Why do you think it's
 so impossible for someone

1147
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:29,100
to like being gay?

00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,930

 about, Mr. Someone.

00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:32,550
My undivided
 attention is on you.

1150
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:35,880
You have no idea what
 it's like to be this way

1151
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,030
in a world that despises you.

1152
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:39,780
Ah, the blame game.

1153
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,030
Society's abuse, the
 government's neglect,

1154
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:44,670
always somebody else's fault.
 You don't like the way you are.

1155
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:48,300
But just as much of the
 world loves you as hates you.

1156
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,100
Your books, your
 parade, your television

1157
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:54,210
shows all insisting gay is good,
 gay is better, gay is best.

1158
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,220
So if you don't like
 yourself, maybe it's

1159
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,110
not because of the world,
 but simply because you

1160
00:55:58,110 --> 00:55:59,880
don't like yourself.

1161
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,350
And given your feelings,
 I don't believe

1162
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:02,970
you've never wondered
 what it would be like not

1163
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:04,500
to have your sexual desires?

1164
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,150
- What gay man hasn't?
 - Bingo.

1165
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:06,900
But so what?

1166
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,240
Wondering isn't the
 same as wanting.

1167
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,340
I like being gay.

1168
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,280
I like being gay.

1169
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,700
I like being gay.

1170
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:14,760
Is my message getting through?

1171
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,010
Yes, a message is beaming
 through, though not the one

1172
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:18,090
you intend.

1173
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:20,730
Would someone say, I
 like, I like, I like,

1174
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:22,510
so fervently if he
 really believed it,

1175
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,180
or do you mutter it under
 your pillow every night,

1176
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,360
like a mantra, hoping
 repetition creates reality.

1177
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,720
Every human organism has parts
 of himself he doesn't like.

1178
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,280
Exactly.

1179
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,430
And survival is finding
 self-love, hunting, digging,

1180
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:37,550
scraping it up off the sidewalk,
 it that's what it takes,

1181
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:38,910
and allowing it to grow.

1182
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,800
You choose only to survive?

1183
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,430
What about thrive?

1184
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:46,470
Survival is talking, conning
 yourself into self-love.

1185
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,960
Thriving is transforming
 yourself into the man

1186
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:52,510
you can and do love.

1187
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,100

 first session, I

1188
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,890

1189
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:59,060
Yeah, I remember.

1190
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,120
Scientists have been
 developing them for years,

1191
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,800

1192
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,770
This tiny pill, can forever
 change your sexuality.

1193
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:12,830
Right.

1194
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:13,920
DR. APSEY: It's merely a game.

1195
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:14,780
Play with me.

1196
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:15,800
Not a chance.

1197
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,910
FRANK: I don't think so.

1198
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:20,020
Why are you so terrified
 of a hypothetical?

1199
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:21,120
Let the world
 take a pill away.

1200
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,220
Let the world take a pill.

1201
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:23,310
So take those away.

1202
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:26,580
That pill will never exist

 the way you are,

1209
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:44,020
how do you know those
 feelings are your own

1210
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,660
or response to those voices?

1211
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,850
You can't know how you
 truly think unless you

1212
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:51,650
silence those voices.

1213
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:53,130
DR. APSEY: Who's
 chattering in your head?

1214
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:56,630
No one.

00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:06,920

1216
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,170
Oh, I don't know.

1217
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:09,730
I could go on all day.
 There are many.

1218
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:10,600
Exactly.

1219
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,060
And all together, if all
 those voices are telling

1220
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,680
you one thing, what is it?

1221
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:15,790
Be a good fag.

1222
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:18,220
Yes, the best little
 fag in the world.

1223
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,710
Is that truly what you
 want or merely a response

1224
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:21,820
to those voices?

1225
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,920

 unless you remove those voices?

1226
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,750
Do you perform exorcisms?

1227
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,220
Quality idea.

1228
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,110
From now on, you hear
 anyone's voice in your head,

1229
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:31,610
you say out, loudly, firmly.
 Out.

1230
00:58:31,610 --> 00:58:33,100
Say it.
 Out.

1231
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:33,880
No.

1232
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,340
- Are you scared?
 - Don't.

1233
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,270
If you eliminate
 those voices, are scared

1234
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:38,120
they'll be anything left?

1235
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,110
Don't you dare do it.

1236
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:40,340
Don't give into the fear.

1237
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,900
Out.

1238
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,510
Good.

1239
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,310
Again.

1240
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:47,290
Out.

1241
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:49,250
Out.

1242
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:52,690
I'd be walking around the
 streets out, out, out.

1243
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:55,800
If you can't verbalize
 it, snap your fingers twice

1244
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,500
and think out.

1245
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,640
[SNAPS] Out.

1246
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,380
[SNAPS] Out.

1247
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:01,340
Snap your fingers.

1248
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,040
Quality.

1249
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:02,780
Again.

1250
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,290
[SNAPS] Good.

1251
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,890
Now say it.
 [SNAPS] Out.

1252
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:10,360
[SNAPS] Out.
 [SNAPS]

1253
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,130
Out.

1254
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:13,030
[SNAPS] Out.

1255
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:15,500
[SNAPS] Out.

1256
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,090
[SNAPS] Out.

1257
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,490
DR. APSEY: Quality.
 Now look at the pill.

1258
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:28,860
It looks like a vitamin.

1259
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:32,080
The most potent medicine
 is often very simple.

1260
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:32,780
Lick it.

1261
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:42,570
DR. APSEY: The taste?
 - Nothing.

1262
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,370
Well, lick it again.
 Lick it harder.

1263
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,320
FRANK: It's nothing.

1264
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:52,690
You're licking
 with your tongue.

1265
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:54,000
Lick with your imagination.

1266
01:00:04,790 --> 01:00:07,270
That's chilled raspberries.

1267
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,270
Smell it.

1268
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:13,960
A wet forest.

1269
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:16,830
A tiny pill looks
 like a vitamin,

1270
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:21,640
but tastes like raspberries
 and smells like a wet forest.

1271
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:22,340
What magic.

1272
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:29,400
Now ignore the hate.

1273
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,360
Ignore the love.

1274
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:33,660
Ignore the hope.

1275
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,570
Ignore the fear.

1276
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:38,220
Ignore the world that
 says you're sick.

1277
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:41,570
Ignore the world that
 says you are special.

1278
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,970
Ignore being the
 evil homosexual.

1279
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:46,430
Ignore being the good fag.

1280
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:50,670
Hypothetically,
 the big if, if you

1281
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:54,200
could obliterate your same
 sex desires, would you?

1282
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:01,650
You hungry?

1283
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:30,640
DR. APSEY: You hungry?
 Hungry, hungry.

1284
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:39,060
Every shirt I own
 has a button missing.

1285
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:41,500
What do you say after brunch
 with your mom tomorrow,

1286
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,200
we go shopping?

1287
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:47,760
Have you ever--

1288
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:57,670
if there was a pill to make
 you straight, would you?

1289
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:01,200
Not in a million years.
 You?

1290
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,220
Not in a billion.

1291
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:04,510
I love how I am.

1292
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:06,060
Yeah, me too.

1293
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:11,470
But for guys who don't, is
 trying so, I don't know, evil?

1294
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:13,540
Not evil.

1295
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:15,180
Useless.

1296
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:16,170
Yeah.

1297
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,210
Of course.

1298
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:21,810
But even if maybe a guy
 has the right to try.

1299
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:24,270
Sure, try.

1300
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:26,820
Then in a month or
 a year or a decade,

1301
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:29,990
it blows up in some woman's
 face or some children's faces.

1302
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:32,700
And everyone has
 wounds that burn

1303
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,000
for the rest of their lives.

1304
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,570
Shirt's ripped, toss or sew?

1305
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:38,340
I don't care.

1306
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:41,070
I'm asking because I'm
 thinking of writing if a guy

1307
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:43,890
wants to try that, it's--

1308
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:47,580
I don't know, maybe, kind
 of sort of not so bad.

1309
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,530
It's a personal choice.

1310
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:52,820
But a false choice.

1311
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:56,620
I mean, for hundreds of years,
 they've tried to fix us.

1312
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,750
They tried
 electroshock, pumping us

1313
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:01,280
full of hormones full of
 drugs, cutting our brains,

1314
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:01,980
cutting our--

1315
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,850
Apsey doesn't do those things.

1316
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:06,070
Frankenstein uses words.

1317
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:07,600
No difference.

1318
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,140
Whatever they try, we're
 still here and always will be,

1319
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:14,050
because it never worked.

1320
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:14,800
[SNAPS]

1321
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,240
Out.

1322
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:18,360
I can't believe I just did that.

1323
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,540
Out?

1324
01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:22,820
- Oh, something Apsey said.
 - Oh?

1325
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,700
You know, if you
 and I are arguing

1326
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:26,790
and we come to a
 standstill, it's a--

1327
01:03:26,790 --> 01:03:29,010
Wait a minute.

1328
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:30,390
You're not talking
 to Frankenstein

1329
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:32,850
about our private life, are you?

1330
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,220
That's what one
 does in therapy.

1331
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,050
He's not your therapist.
 He's research.

1332
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:38,250
Remember?

1333
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:39,600
Yeah, of course,
 he's research.

1334
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:51,640
Frank, promise me
 you won't go back.

1335
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,350
He's dangerous.

1336
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:56,440
He will open your skull
 like cracking an egg.

1337
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:59,440
And he'll reach his hands in
 and he will need your brain

1338
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,350
like dough, until you won't
 even remember you have a penis,

1339
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:04,930
let alone what you
 like to do with it.

1340
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:06,470
I've seen it.

1341
01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:08,230
I have four clients
 who told me how

1342
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:10,330
Frankenstein has
 crept into their heads

1343
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:11,930
and destroyed their lives.

1344
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:14,830
Please, promise me
 you won't go back.

1345
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:15,990
You've seen the
 damage he does.

1346
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:16,690
I haven't.

1347
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:23,990
OK, a new client
 started yesterday,

1348
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:25,170
a pickup from Apsey--

1349
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:25,880
Hello.

1350
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,860
JONATHAN: He's been
 seeing Frankenstein

1351
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,080
for about two years.
 DR. APSEY: Who?

1352
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,920
How?
 Don't you wonder how?

1353
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:32,610
Jonathan, we were wondering
 with hundreds of gay therapists

1354
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:36,390
in this city, somehow of
 all Dr. Apsey's ex-clients

1355
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:38,110
end up saying you.

1356
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:40,060
How do they find you?

1357
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:40,970
You develop a reputation.

1358
01:04:40,970 --> 01:04:41,670
Huh.

1359
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,290
JONATHAN: This new client,
 I could ask about you

1360
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:45,130
getting an interview--

1361
01:04:45,130 --> 01:04:46,250
- Double huh.
 - If--

1362
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,700
- Beware the if.
 - If?

1363
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:51,640
If you promise me never
 to see Frankenstein again.

1364
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,120
You're-- you're-- you're--

1365
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,060
He's bribing you.

1366
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:55,020
You're bribing me?

1367
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:56,320
DR. APSEY: Although
 technically there's

1368
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,590
been no exchange of money.

1369
01:04:58,590 --> 01:04:59,950
It's like blackmail.

1370
01:04:59,950 --> 01:05:01,040
You're blackmailing me.

1371
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,260
Not precisely blackmailing.

1372
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:03,400
I can't believe you.

1373
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,010
I just want to be clear here,
 because if you're really--

1374
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:07,510
you are resorting to--
 - Manipulation.

1375
01:05:07,510 --> 01:05:08,730
He's manipulating you.

1376
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:09,820
I'm manipulating you.

1377
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:12,220
How dare you try
 to manipulate me.

1378
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:14,620
You ask this new
 client or you don't.

1379
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:16,680
No strings attached.

1380
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,800
All right, I will ask.

1381
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,450
No strings attached.

1382
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:22,230
What a weak organism.

1383
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:23,940
No, if you think
 it's unprofessional.

1384
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:25,870
You are stronger
 than that, Mr. Johnson.

1385
01:05:25,870 --> 01:05:26,930
Do it.
 Don't.

1386
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:28,760
Don't ask.

1387
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:29,570
I'm getting whiplash.

1388
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:32,400
You are stronger.

1389
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,660
Fuck professionalism.

1390
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,060
I have.

1391
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:36,710
Ask.

1392
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:40,070
I don't consider my
 therapy conversion therapy.

1393
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:43,970
I consider my therapy therapy.

1394
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:48,400
Dr. Apsey never, never,
 never encouraged me to do

1395
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,950
anything against my own will.

1396
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:52,250
People come to me.

1397
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:54,010
I do not seek them out.

1398
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:56,860
And I try to make
 their lives better.

1399
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:00,580
The repercussions of
 Apsey's work were severe.

1400
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:03,730
I believed that I was doing
 the right thing for the good

1401
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:09,370
of my clients who have suffered
 from this kind of junk science

1402
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:10,360
for far too long.

1403
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:17,140
I've been clear.

1404
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,180
Unannounced drop-bys
 are unacceptable.

1405
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,300
You have severe boundary issues.

1406
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:26,120
Yesterday, that-- that
 magic pills so-called game

1407
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,340
was so-- so-- so manipulative.

1408
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:30,530
I prefer the label
 truth facilitation.

1409
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:32,150
I offer a mirror.

1410
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:34,690
OK, so maybe a mirror,
 because swallowing

1411
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:38,180
a pill may be reflect, shows
 that-- that some part--

1412
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:41,210
teeny tiny so, teeny
 tiny part wants maybe

1413
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:42,490
wants what you have to offer.

1414
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:44,030
OK, but so what?

1415
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:47,650
This-- this change-- supposed
 change, you say it's not easy.

1416
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,430
You say it's the most
 difficult thing you ever do.

1417
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:50,990
But what you don't say is--

1418
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:54,240
the word you don't
 use is impossible.

1419
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,000
Yes, Dr. Baldwin
 and his clones

1420
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,320
have worked
 tirelessly to promote

1421
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,390
the myth of impossibility.

1422
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,360
But I know deep
 down I was born--

1423
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,720
So what?

1424
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,590
It's in my genes.

1425
01:07:03,590 --> 01:07:05,240
I have no control
 over my attractions.

1426
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,610
Ha, ha, fully 50 types of bunk.

1427
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:09,230
So maybe a chunk of
 your hypothalamus

1428
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:11,420
is bigger than the average
 bear's or your mother

1429
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:14,000
dressed you in taffeta or your
 father was a weak and distant

1430
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,400
or your big brother told
 you vaginas have teeth.

1431
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,680
Who cares why?

1432
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:22,490
Inside each of us is
 the liar, the thief,

1433
01:07:22,490 --> 01:07:28,430
the killer, but also the
 saint, the healer, the lover.

1434
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:30,950
DR. APSEY: Isn't life about
 the parts of ourselves

1435
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:33,720
we choose to cultivate
 and act upon?

1436
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,780
Isn't America
 based on the belief

1437
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:37,610
of bettering ourselves
 and picking ourselves up,

1438
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:41,480
rising above, transcendence?

1439
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:46,460
In India, a master walks
 across coals 600 degrees

1440
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:47,330
Fahrenheit.

1441
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:49,660
His feet remain unburned.

1442
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:52,760
A yogi locks himself in a
 vault with just enough oxygen

1443
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:56,690
for an hour, yet he slows down
 his heartbeat so that oxygen

1444
01:07:56,690 --> 01:08:00,080
lasts a day instead of an hour.

1445
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,220
You tell me the human mind
 can accomplish these marvels,

1446
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:07,260
but you can't control where
 you want to put your peepee.

1447
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:08,250
I don't think so.

1448
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,840
But a man walks on
 coals, I can see that.

1449
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,030
Yet a man says he's changed
 and you refuse to believe that.

1450
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:16,890
But it doesn't
 matter whether you

1451
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:19,620
want to believe my therapy
 works or not, because you still

1452
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:21,350
have to choose.

1453
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:24,050
A year from now or
 five years or 10 years,

1454
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:26,570
there's going to be a
 shot or a gene therapy

1455
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:28,930
or a tiny pill that
 tastes like raspberries,

1456
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:32,420
smells like a wet forest,
 sexual attraction will

1457
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:34,400
change as easily as hair color.

1458
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:37,220
Clinging to the illusion that
 my therapy doesn't work merely

1459
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:38,870
postpones the inevitable.

1460
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:43,590
You, everybody like you,
 will have to choose.

1461
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:44,560
So what?

1462
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,650
What am I going to do?

1463
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:49,250
I'm going to just renounce,
 betray just reset my sights

1464
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:52,700
and aim for heterosexuality
 because sometime in the future

1465
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:53,490
it will be possible?

1466
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:54,920
I don't care what you choose.

1467
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:58,160
The motives behind my magic
 pill game were self-serving.

1468
01:08:58,160 --> 01:09:01,250
So you could experience the
 view from my client's vantage.

1469
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:02,630
So your journalistic
 portrait of me

1470
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:05,420
would be more comprehensive
 though the magic pill

1471
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:07,460
was to what manipulate
 me into civility?

1472
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:09,590
Well, no more manipulative
 than the so-called professional

1473
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:11,270
tactics you've used on me.

1474
01:09:11,270 --> 01:09:13,340
Considering the precarious
 position in which you put me,

1475
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,020
I think I'll be forgiven
 if my magic pill

1476
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,130
game was self-serving.

1477
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:19,580
Now, no more dropping by.

1478
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:22,620
I don't ever want
 to see you again.

1479
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:23,870
Good luck with your article.

1480
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:25,990
Thank you for allowing me
 to express my thoughts.

1481
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:26,690
Be well.

1482
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:28,200
Be happy.

1483
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:28,970
Be gay.

1484
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,600
You're up late.

1485
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,820
You're out late.

1486
01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:37,610
Dinner is cold.

1487
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:38,880
I'm colder.

1488
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:39,590
Come warm me up.

1489
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:45,930
You eat?
 - No.

1490
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:48,370
- Tupperware.
 - It smells good.

1491
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:49,520
Ah, it's the bread.

1492
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,670
The bananas were rotting.

1493
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:51,620
I left something out.

1494
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:52,740
It chews like lead.

1495
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:56,780
I'm sure it's delicious.

1496
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:58,430
He said no.

1497
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:02,080
He who?

1498
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:04,680
JONATHAN: My new client,
 about an interview.

1499
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:09,370
All the others.

1500
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:10,840
You could ask one, you
 could ask the others.

1501
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:11,540
Frank.

1502
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,450
Be careful, respectful.

1503
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:13,500
I'll give you a
 list of questions.

1504
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:13,700
Frank.

1505
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:14,970
One might be willing
 to talk to me--

1506
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:17,390
Frank, I already brought the
 subject up as a hypothetical.

1507
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:19,960
They said no.

1508
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,390
All of them.

1509
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:23,360
Yeah.

1510
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,780
How convenient.

1511
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:28,200
How many?

1512
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,180
Four.

1513
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:31,120
All four?

1514
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,030
- All four?
 - How amazing.

1515
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:34,830
What an amazing
 show of solidarity.

1516
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:36,060
Except that they're
 not acquainted.

1517
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,450
Except that they
 don't know each other.

1518
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:39,840
So it's not solidarity,
 but a coincidence.

1519
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,150
So this is an
 amazing coincidence

1520
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:44,580
that all four have so quickly
 dismissed being interviewed.

1521
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:45,640
You don't leave me?

1522
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,820
Such razor sharp
 perception skills.

1523
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,390
Why would you lie?

1524
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:51,270
How how long have
 we been together?

1525
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:52,470
How patronizing.

1526
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:54,030
Why do you put with this?

1527
01:10:54,030 --> 01:10:54,790
Don't patronize me.

1528
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:55,620
You know as well as I do.

1529
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:59,250
In all hours six years,
 four months, and 13 days,

1530
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:01,320
yes, I know exactly.

1531
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,210
Before Frankenstein
 entered your life,

1532
01:11:03,210 --> 01:11:05,080
do you remember even
 once not trusting me?

1533
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:07,010
I hardly have the power to
 make you distrust each other.

1534
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:09,030
Dr. Apsey can make
 us distrust each other.

1535
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:10,830
Yeah, he can.

1536
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:12,690
It wasn't till after
 all this started,

1537
01:11:12,690 --> 01:11:14,100
that I began distrusting you.

1538
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,850
You never used to
 hide things from me.

1539
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:17,050
I'm not now.

1540
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:24,340
Your editor called
 this afternoon.

1541
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:26,280
I asked her how she thought
 the article was going.

1542
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,310
She said what article?

1543
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:30,640
The article you told me
 she was so anxious to see.

1544
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:32,850
She had no idea what
 I was talking about.

1545
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,480
You had no right.

1546
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,710
I asked anyway.

1547
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:36,650
I'm not sorry.

1548
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:38,780
Because I never had a
 vision for the article.

1549
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:41,050
I wasn't going to put myself out
 on a limb till I was certain.

1550
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:43,030
So you lied to me.

1551
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:45,090
I-- I-- I withheld
 minor information.

1552
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:46,870
You never used to
 lie to me until you

1553
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:48,180
started seeing Frankenstein.

1554
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,960
That absolutely
 cannot be pinned on me.

1555
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:54,370
The day we met you asked if
 I had plans for Saturday night.

1556
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:56,560
I answered no, then rushed
 to the nearest pay phone

1557
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,310
to cancel them.

1558
01:11:57,310 --> 01:11:59,010
It's not a big lie, but a lie.

1559
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:00,640
What about that
 plaid tie you love

1560
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,040
and I said it's only mildly
 unpleasant, when in fact it's

1561
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,060
extraordinarily ugly.

1562
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:06,580
I've lied between the
 sheets that the thing

1563
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:09,830
you do with the fur feels
 good when it just scratches.

1564
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:12,640
I've lied about liking this
 sugar-free fat-free banana

1565
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:14,260
bread lead slop you make.

1566
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:16,570
I've probably lied to
 you daily for a month.

1567
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:17,470
I'll make a list.

1568
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:20,290
And, yes, I lied about
 pitching the article before I'd

1569
01:12:20,290 --> 01:12:21,850
ever set eyes on Dr. Apsey.

1570
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:24,190
So if you didn't believe
 in the article, why--

1571
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:25,510
Because I always
 do what you want.

1572
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,750
Did.
 Past tense, did.

1573
01:12:29,750 --> 01:12:31,090
And will you
 write the article?

1574
01:12:31,090 --> 01:12:32,700
- Of course.
 - When?

1575
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,360
Unrelenting, isn't he?

1576
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,140
When I'm ready.

1577
01:12:36,140 --> 01:12:40,300
Show me, whatever you have.

1578
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:41,560
Anything?

1579
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:42,730
I haven't even
 seen a single word.

1580
01:12:42,730 --> 01:12:43,780
It's in my head.

1581
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:46,030
I'll put it on paper when
 I complete my research.

1582
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:47,950
And an estimated
 completion date?

1583
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,420
The banana bread's not so bad.

1584
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:54,360
You're too hard on yourself.

1585
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:14,140
I know you didn't want to
 see me again, and I know--

1586
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:16,660
Yes, yes, yes, I
 expected you back.

1587
01:13:16,660 --> 01:13:17,680
You did?

1588
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:20,660
Yes, of course.

1589
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:22,970
But why?

1590
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:25,580
You can answer for yourself.

1591
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:27,740
I'm here for the article.

1592
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:30,500
The article, the article, the
 article, look me in the eye.

1593
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:33,980
Tell me you've
 written one sentence.

1594
01:13:33,980 --> 01:13:34,680
I thought not.

1595
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,860
Now the unanswered question,
 was your smokescreen

1596
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:41,320
conscious or not?

1597
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,070
OK, listen, if a man--

1598
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:46,560
not me, hypothetical-- if a man
 wanted to see you for therapy,

1599
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:47,970
but couldn't--

1600
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:48,720
Couldn't?

1601
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:51,510
Yeah, say he
 couldn't afford it.

1602
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:53,430
I'd offer for free.

1603
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,510
No, free has no value.

1604
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:56,160
I'd charge $1.

1605
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,580
OK, not because he couldn't
 pay, but for some other reason,

1606
01:13:58,580 --> 01:13:59,280
whatever.

1607
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:01,170
He can't see you,
 but he might want

1608
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:04,260
to kind of sort of
 maybe work on his own,

1609
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:05,940
what would you tell him?

1610
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:09,770
I would ask this man
 when's the last time he had

1611
01:14:09,770 --> 01:14:11,420
dinner with a male
 organism who didn't

1612
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:12,680
share his sexual leanings?

1613
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:15,720
If it had been
 a long, long time?

1614
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:19,380
That would suggest
 Mr. Hypothetical lacks

1615
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:21,840
comfort with the male gender.

1616
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,790
All men have same gender needs.

1617
01:14:23,790 --> 01:14:26,070
If humankind could
 accept same gender

1618
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:28,290
emotional needs as normal,
 homosexual behavior

1619
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:29,040
would disappear.

1620
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:33,610
But close-minded organisms
 label same gender needs as gay.

1621
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:37,650
So if you feel and admit same
 gender needs, you're gay.

1622
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:40,020
But you're not, you
 have same gender needs.

1623
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:41,910
That's all.

1624
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,890
But back to Mr. Hypothetical.

1625
01:14:44,890 --> 01:14:48,420
Meet men without his leanings.

1626
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:51,540
Study how they interact,
 how they express or repress

1627
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:53,940
their same gender needs.

1628
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:56,540
Become friends with the
 type of man he wants to be.

1629
01:14:56,540 --> 01:14:59,670
And reading, I'd offer a list
 of books-- really, Mr. Johnston,

1630
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:02,160
must we maintain this
 pretense of the hypothetical?

1631
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:02,910
Yes, we must.

1632
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:09,380
Would you care
 to peruse the list

1633
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,960
I'd offer Mr. Hypothetical?

1634
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,650
No.

1635
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:13,760
Yes.

1636
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:16,840
No.
 Maybe.

1637
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:20,240
If it's handy.

1638
01:15:26,650 --> 01:15:28,390
Hi, sorry, I'm late.

1639
01:15:28,390 --> 01:15:30,340
Subway.

1640
01:15:30,340 --> 01:15:32,790
Subway's been screwed
 up a lot lately.

1641
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:35,490
Yeah.

1642
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:38,280
You were out late last night.

1643
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:41,450
Were you staying away
 till I was asleep?

1644
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:42,230
Absolutely not.

1645
01:15:45,680 --> 01:15:48,260
Well, maybe.

1646
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:49,780
I'm tired of fighting.

1647
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:52,360
Come on, let's play.

1648
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:55,360
You going to tell
 me where you were?

1649
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:58,200
I was out walking.

1650
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:01,040
Serve.

1651
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,930
You reeked of cigarette smoke.

1652
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,360
- I thought you were asleep.
 - I wasn't.

1653
01:16:11,630 --> 01:16:12,500
JONATHAN: One, nothing.

1654
01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:20,680
So?

1655
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,460
I went to a sports
 bar, you know.

1656
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:28,280
Studied straight men in
 their natural habitat.

1657
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,970
Research?

1658
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:32,400
How's the article going?

1659
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,230
I don't want to
 talk about that.

1660
01:16:35,230 --> 01:16:37,450
Not going well?

1661
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:38,590
The idea was yours.

1662
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:40,060
But now the article is mine.

1663
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,310
From here on,
 Apsey's off limits.

1664
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:43,010
Two, nothing.

1665
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:56,150
Why'd you move up
 our racquetball time.

1666
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:57,420
JONATHAN: You're
 changing the subject.

1667
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:58,300
Yeah, I know.

1668
01:16:58,300 --> 01:16:59,380
Meeting canceled.

1669
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:00,820
I didn't want to go.

1670
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:02,620
Jonathan Baldwin not in
 the mood for a meeting.

1671
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:05,260
Has the sky fallen?
 - Yeah.

1672
01:17:08,710 --> 01:17:10,190
It's my serve.

1673
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,580
Please tell me you're not
 seeing Frankenstein for real.

1674
01:17:25,110 --> 01:17:26,520
You've mastered that.

1675
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,200
Have you ever considered
 communicating with words?

1676
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,850
Don't call him Frankenstein.

1677
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:31,090
His name is Arthur Apsey.

1678
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:34,650
Sweetheart, I'm
 sorry if you were born

1679
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,150
a way you don't want to be.

1680
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:38,830
But you can't change that.

1681
01:17:38,830 --> 01:17:40,470
Not I don't want
 you to, but can't.

1682
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:48,010
You used to melt in my arms.

1683
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:51,610
Now you repel.

1684
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:59,990
When was the last
 time we made love?

1685
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:02,360
That event was not momentous
 enough to mark on my calendar.

1686
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,490
Five weeks, two days.

1687
01:18:04,490 --> 01:18:05,930
Plenty of couples
 go five weeks.

1688
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:07,550
You first met
 Frankenstein what?

1689
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:10,310
Six, seven weeks ago?

1690
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:11,120
Coincidence?

1691
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,340
And those men you
 were with at the bar,

1692
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:21,100
if they're so straight, why did
 I smell them on your clothes?

1693
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:22,470
Why did I smell one
 of them on your skin?

1694
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:29,370
Please tell me you were safe.

1695
01:18:29,370 --> 01:18:30,860
I-- I didn't.

1696
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:31,660
No lies.

1697
01:18:31,660 --> 01:18:33,300
Yes or no, did you have
 sex with another man.

1698
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:34,000
No.

1699
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:38,700
No.

1700
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:56,050
Remember, I told you in
 high school, you know--

1701
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:57,300
Yeah, I remember.

1702
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,690
I lied.
 I was never bashed.

1703
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:04,100
It never happened, huh?

1704
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:07,610
It happened, but not
 the way I told you.

1705
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:24,060
The hell hole I grew
 up in had a town punk.

1706
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:31,740
Every now and then when the
 beer wouldn't anesthetize

1707
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:34,650
the boredom, the town punk
 and his gang of punk wannabes

1708
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:39,210
would drive up to Chicago and
 set a bar on an open flatbed

1709
01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:43,810
of a pickup, spitting
 epithets at shoppers

1710
01:19:43,810 --> 01:19:47,040
who fell into the category
 loosely described as fruity.

1711
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:55,660
One summer night, they
 spied a boy who they laughed

1712
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:58,410
was so fruity he could
 pose for a still life.

1713
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:04,570
Fruity boy fought back.

1714
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:09,860
The fruity boy got
 hit, got kicked,

1715
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:13,260
got a broken beer bottle
 ground into his face.

1716
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:17,300
The punk and his buds bolted.

1717
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:20,670
The punk went away to college
 and moved as far from Chicago

1718
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:21,370
as he could.

1719
01:20:28,480 --> 01:20:33,000
Eventually, the punk became me.

1720
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,360
The memory of that
 bleeding boy consumed--

01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:51,720

 street a face, a scar,

I mean, I know what I did,
 but I'll never really know.

This-- this is truth.

01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:06,360
I'm sorry.

1725
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:08,480
JONATHAN: I'm sorry.
 - You're amazing.

1726

You once were a
 self-hating redneck.

OK.

 I went to a bar,

1749
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:48,690
you know, a regular
 bar to study men.

1750
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:52,240

curves in all the places I'd
 want curves if I liked curves.

01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:02,980

01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:06,050
Flirts.

1757
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:08,590
You know, sparkly
 eyes, head thrown back,

1758
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:10,720
a deep throaty laugh.

1759
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,360
She helps me forget who
 I am and invites me home.

1760
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,980
I go.

1761
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:18,340
Then the pre-sex dance, men,
 women, it's all the same.

1762
01:24:18,340 --> 01:24:24,190
You know, the heart's pounding.

1763
01:24:24,190 --> 01:24:28,960
It's me and it,
 out, working order.

1764
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,060
I stick it in.

1765
01:24:31,060 --> 01:24:33,570
I do it.

1766
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:35,790
And it was off.

1767
01:24:35,790 --> 01:24:38,200
The smells, the tastes were off.

1768
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:39,840
How could such an
 ill considered attempt

1769
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:42,350
end in anything but failure?

1770
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:45,630
Which you knew beforehand.
 Tea?

1771
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:53,270
So this escapade puzzles me.

1772
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:57,050
I want to believe your mission
 to destroy me is terminated,

1773
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,760
but I'm aware of the
 possibility that you

1774
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,530
may still be hoodwinking me.

1775
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:03,990
And quite frankly,
 this turn of events

1776
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:06,630
makes me doubt your sincerity.

1777
01:25:06,630 --> 01:25:09,140
So now, it's my turn
 to demand proof.

1778
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,250
Proof?
 What?

1779
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:11,490
That I'm with a woman?

1780
01:25:11,490 --> 01:25:14,580
A different kind of proof.

1781
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:16,770
I'm filing a complaint
 against your Dr. Baldwin

1782
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:19,160
with the psychology
 licensing board.

1783
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:20,370
What?

1784
01:25:20,370 --> 01:25:23,670
What he's done going
 after me is wrong.

1785
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:24,570
Please, no.

1786
01:25:24,570 --> 01:25:27,340
And you'll be
 expected to testify.

1787
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:28,440
I won't turn on Jonathan.

1788
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:29,640
I'm not asking you to.

1789
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,570
Merely tell the truth.

1790
01:25:30,570 --> 01:25:31,970
The truth is the
 same as turning on him.

1791
01:25:31,970 --> 01:25:33,500
If there's one thing
 you've learned from me,

1792
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:34,380
isn't it not to lie?

1793
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:35,100
Yes.

1794
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:37,600
And if the board
 talks to you, will you?

1795
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,270
Please, don't do this.

1796
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:40,370
I'll do anything.

1797
01:25:40,370 --> 01:25:41,070
Just ask.

1798
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:43,260
But don't hurt Jonathan.

1799
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:45,150
An acquaintance
 of mine at the board

1800
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:47,430
told me your Dr. Baldwin
 inquired about filing

1801
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:49,970
a complaint against me.

1802
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:52,430
I'm filing a counter
 complaint because, at the risk

1803
01:25:52,430 --> 01:25:55,520
of sounding like a
 five-year-old, he started it.

1804
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,010
If you are able to
 dissuade your Dr. Baldwin,

1805
01:25:58,010 --> 01:26:00,140
I'd be less inclined to
 file a complaint of my own.

1806
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:02,630
I'll stop him.

1807
01:26:02,630 --> 01:26:05,150
I imagine you overestimate
 your influence on Dr. Baldwin,

1808
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:07,340
but I'll wait one
 week to provide

1809
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:09,610
you with the opportunity.

1810
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:12,920
Now, your misguided
 sexual attempt, what

1811
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:13,820
was that all about?

1812
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:15,710
- I don't know.
 - You don't know?

1813
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:16,760
Of course, not.

1814
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,820
Shall we construct
 some possibilities?

1815
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:22,790
Perhaps research for a new
 article, arousing first person

1816
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:25,860
narrative on how it was to sleep
 with a woman in, oh, how many

1817
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:27,920
years?
 - Oh, lots of them.

1818
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,800
Any reality to this
 first hypothesis?

1819
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:30,500
No.

1820
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:34,950
Then hypothesis number
 2, this woman found

1821
01:26:34,950 --> 01:26:37,350
you so irresistible,
 she began shoving

1822
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:38,820
$100 bills down your shorts?

1823
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:40,230
It wasn't that kind of bar.

1824
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:41,460
Well, let me
 suggest a particularly

1825
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:43,200
far fetched hypothesis.

1826
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:49,440
Perhaps you slept with a
 woman because, gee, gosh,

1827
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:50,140
you wanted to.

1828
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:54,490
DR. APSEY: Ah, no response.

1829
01:26:57,390 --> 01:26:58,970
I'm not sure.

1830
01:26:58,970 --> 01:26:59,900
DR. APSEY: How could you be?

1831
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:08,920
Clarity is unobtainable as long
 as you live with Dr. Baldwin.

1832
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,120
I love him.

1833
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:12,200
So?

1834
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:16,160
The great romantic myth is that
 love is the highest calling.

1835
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:18,230
It's not.

1836
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:22,260
I once had a client who
 justified sex with his dog,

1837
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:24,800
because he loved the creature.

1838
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,560
His dog.

1839
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:28,960
Love is no excuse
 for poor choices.

1840
01:27:31,570 --> 01:27:34,730
The Dr. Baldwin you
 love set you up.

1841
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:38,980
He used you for
 his own vendetta.

1842
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:41,590
Why didn't he come
 to see me himself?

1843
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:43,180
Because he didn't
 want to risk anything.

1844
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:54,160
I like you.

1845
01:27:54,160 --> 01:28:00,610
But you've been one
 dumb dupe, his pawn.

1846
01:28:00,610 --> 01:28:01,800
He's not a man to trust.

1847
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:07,760
Your life has no room in it for
 a manipulator like Dr. Baldwin.

1848
01:28:11,130 --> 01:28:12,100
Clear enough?

1849
01:28:16,110 --> 01:28:16,810
I guess.

1850
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:23,920
Good man.

1851
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:27,360
DR. APSEY: Now, be firm.
 In control.

1852
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,860
Your Dr. Baldwin will
 employ all his tricks

1853
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:30,950
to demolish this decision.

1854
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:36,260
Understandably, he's
 got a lot to lose.

1855
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:39,740
You.

1856
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:18,790
- Morning.
 - Hey.

1857
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:23,780
Out all night?

1858
01:29:26,840 --> 01:29:30,090
I'm thinking--

1859
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:31,050
Uh, huh.

1860
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:36,390
I'm thinking
 maybe it's time to--

1861
01:29:40,670 --> 01:29:52,530
it's time to-- to end us.

1862
01:29:57,450 --> 01:29:58,150
More research?

1863
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:04,890
You have the divorce experience
 and presto more material

1864
01:30:04,890 --> 01:30:06,300
for the article that never was.

1865
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:10,410
I don't appreciate
 your attitude.

1866
01:30:10,410 --> 01:30:12,870
If I'm ever going to figure
 out what life I want,

1867
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:16,830
I need to leave.

1868
01:30:16,830 --> 01:30:19,440
I need out.

1869
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:32,110
I will let you
 go, no fight, if you

1870
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:33,870
swear you'll never go back.

1871
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:34,570
I-- I can't.

1872
01:30:34,570 --> 01:30:36,100
I won't promise that.

1873
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,370
I won't let you go back.

1874
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:39,070
What?

1875
01:30:39,070 --> 01:30:39,780
You'll time me up?

1876
01:30:39,780 --> 01:30:41,090
Hire a 24 hour guard.

1877
01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:42,010
Whatever it takes.

1878
01:30:42,010 --> 01:30:42,780
Frank, heel.

1879
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:43,480
Frank, sit.

1880
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,510
Frank, stay.

1881
01:30:44,510 --> 01:30:45,460
Frank, write this article.

1882
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:49,510
No, I won't live with your
 demands, with your lies,

1883
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:52,830
with your
 manipulations, with you.

1884
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:54,960
I lied once.

1885
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:56,420
With Sebastian.

1886
01:30:56,420 --> 01:30:57,830
That's the only time
 I've ever lied to you

1887
01:30:57,830 --> 01:30:58,970
Behind my back.

1888
01:30:58,970 --> 01:31:02,290
A complaint against Apsey,
 if that's not a lie, what is?

1889
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:03,140
Yeah, I know.

1890
01:31:03,140 --> 01:31:04,040
And he knows too.

1891
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:05,440
And he's going to file
 a counter complaint

1892
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:06,540
if you go through with it.

1893
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:08,230
How can I trust you any more.

1894
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:09,800
It's a lie here,
 and a lie there.

1895
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:11,360
And they build and
 build and build.

1896
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,490
All of a sudden there's a
 swamp of lies just smothering

1897
01:31:13,490 --> 01:31:15,830
our relationship,
 a dark, dank sludge

1898
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:17,060
that we're wobbling through.

1899
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:18,600
And I'm sick of a stink.

1900
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:19,660
I'm sick of you.

1901
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:20,960
And I want out.

1902
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,210
FRANK: I don't mean
 this very moment.

1903
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:39,550
That's mine.

1904
01:31:39,550 --> 01:31:40,380
JONATHAN: Yeah.

1905
01:31:40,380 --> 01:31:42,170
You're packing for me?

1906
01:31:42,170 --> 01:31:43,640
Us.

1907
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:44,880
Us?

1908
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:46,130
Bermuda.

1909
01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:48,630
You always wanted to go, right?
 - Jonathan.

1910
01:31:52,430 --> 01:31:53,380
Fuck.

1911
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:55,830
Fuck.

1912
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:57,430
JONATHAN: How many times
 have I told clients you

1913
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:58,600
can't change another person?

1914
01:31:58,600 --> 01:31:59,710
Let go.

1915
01:31:59,710 --> 01:32:01,820
And yet I can't.

1916
01:32:01,820 --> 01:32:04,840
I'm getting you away
 from that monster.

1917
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,320
We thought you'd pull
 something like this.

1918
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:08,020
We?

1919
01:32:12,630 --> 01:32:15,020
Where you going

1920
01:32:15,020 --> 01:32:19,730
To Frankenstein's castle,
 for a heart to heart,

1921
01:32:19,730 --> 01:32:21,160
or a fist to fist.

1922
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,740
I'll decide which on the way.

1923
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:27,170
[MUSIC PLAYING]

1924
01:32:35,990 --> 01:32:39,910
Just-- just-- just
 let me talk to him.

1925
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:42,780
Ah, the announced visit
 with gays multiplying.

1926
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:44,660
Dr. Baldwin, I presume.
 Welcome.

1927
01:32:44,660 --> 01:32:45,930
I'm sorry.
 I tried to stop him.

1928
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:47,090
It's quite all right.
 The pleasure is all mine.

1929
01:32:47,090 --> 01:32:48,000
Nobody's.

1930
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,030
This war is between you and me.
 - Jonathan, please--

1931
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:52,000
Leave Frank out of it.

1932
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,410
Shut up, Frank, I'm
 doing this for you.

1933
01:32:53,410 --> 01:32:54,870
Shut up?
 You treat me like a child.

1934
01:32:54,870 --> 01:32:56,500
- Then act like an adult.
 - I am.

1935
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:57,670
I don't think so.

1936
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:59,300
- You act like an adult.
 - I-- I--

1937
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:00,310
I am.
 - Gentlemen.

1938
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:01,980
Like was that adult?

1939
01:33:01,980 --> 01:33:03,090
Gentleman.

1940
01:33:03,090 --> 01:33:04,620
I don't do couples therapy.

1941
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:08,850
Now, Dr. Baldwin, I'm
 pleased you're here.

1942
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:10,830
This game of yours has
 gone on long enough.

1943
01:33:10,830 --> 01:33:12,070
This is a game to you.

1944
01:33:12,070 --> 01:33:13,190
This isn't any case.

1945
01:33:13,190 --> 01:33:16,110
And your pawn, Mr.
 Johnston, is suffering.

1946
01:33:16,110 --> 01:33:18,000
I am not a. pawn.

1947
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,750
He is not my pawn.

1948
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:20,820
You don't need to talk for me.

1949
01:33:20,820 --> 01:33:21,790
JONATHAN: Then tell him.

1950
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:23,100
Listen, I am not--

1951
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:24,320
I was his pawn.

1952
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:25,800
JONATHAN: Frank.

1953
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,330
But you don't
 have to call me one.

1954
01:33:27,330 --> 01:33:29,430
How dare you
 call Frank a pawn.

1955
01:33:29,430 --> 01:33:30,580
Don't defend me.

1956
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:31,620
Apparently, you need--

1957
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:32,450
I don't need you to.

1958
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:33,550
No, I don't.

1959
01:33:33,550 --> 01:33:35,430
No, I don't.
 [CLAPS]

1960
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:38,800
Can we stop this
 infantile doo-doo?

1961
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:41,420
Heavens, you two
 together are a nightmare.

1962
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:42,560
Can we get a collective grip?

1963
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:44,270
JONATHAN: You keep
 your sucking strangling

1964
01:33:44,270 --> 01:33:46,050
tentacles off of Frank.
 - If not?

1965
01:33:46,050 --> 01:33:49,100
Because if not, every ounce
 of pain that you inflict

1966
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:52,220
upon the man I love I will
 turn back on you tenfold

1967
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:54,090
until you withered and broken--

1968
01:33:54,090 --> 01:33:58,510
Blah, blah, blah,
 blah, blah, blah.

1969
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:01,500
I'm sorry I have no patience
 with such dedicated hate.

1970
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:02,960
Hate is not a family value.

1971
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,390
JONATHAN: Ding, ding, ding.

1972
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:05,820
Bob, deceit for 20.

1973
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:06,890
Take a look in the mirror.

1974
01:34:06,890 --> 01:34:07,710
A mirror?

1975
01:34:07,710 --> 01:34:11,690
One of us is reported,
 both of us are.

1976
01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:13,880
There's no victory in
 sacrificing one another.

1977
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:16,300
A truce, no complaints.

1978
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:23,010
No complaints, if--

1979
01:34:23,010 --> 01:34:25,700
if you agree never
 to see Frank again.

1980
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:30,850
Agreed, if you never again
 steal from me another client.

1981
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:33,600
Absa-fucking-lutely not.

1982
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:36,070
What's more important to you?

1983
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:37,090
Mr. Johnston?

1984
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:39,090
Your clients?

1985
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:40,090
Your license?

1986
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:42,070
You're stopping m?

1987
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:43,380
You can't have them all.

1988
01:34:43,380 --> 01:34:46,440
Prioritize.

1989
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:47,970
You are pure evil.

1990
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:49,800
DR. APSEY: I am pure nothing.

1991
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:50,540
And neither are you.

1992
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,190
Deal.

1993
01:34:54,190 --> 01:34:59,130
In truth, to keep
 Mr. Johnston, you'd

1994
01:34:59,130 --> 01:35:01,140
condemn dozens of
 men to my therapy,

1995
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:01,950
which you believe evil?

1996
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:04,170
Do we have a deal or not?

1997
01:35:04,170 --> 01:35:05,250
No, my offer was a bluff.

1998
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:06,910
I didn't think you'd accept.

1999
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:09,090
You may be willing to
 sacrifice dozens of other men

2000
01:35:09,090 --> 01:35:10,140
to save Mr. Johnston.

2001
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:13,230
But I won't sacrifice Mr.
 Johnston to save myself.

2002
01:35:13,230 --> 01:35:19,260
The only deal I'll agree to,
 no complaints, no conditions.

2003
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:21,540
See you in the
 unemployment line.

2004
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:24,260
DR. APSEY: Believe it or not,
 Dr. Baldwin, I respect you.

2005
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:24,960
Fuck you.

2006
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:29,080
Well, parts of you, the part
 that dreams of a perfect world

2007
01:35:29,080 --> 01:35:31,710
where everybody is
 happy and well adjusted.

2008
01:35:31,710 --> 01:35:33,400
That would be lovely.

2009
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:36,310
But in some men's perfect
 world, they wouldn't be

2010
01:35:36,310 --> 01:35:38,390
OK with their same sex desires.

2011
01:35:38,390 --> 01:35:39,520
They simply wouldn't have any.

2012
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:41,350
Do you have a son?

2013
01:35:41,350 --> 01:35:44,050
Dr. Baldwin, you've chosen
 to fight to change the world--

2014
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:45,010
A nephew?

2015
01:35:45,010 --> 01:35:45,740
Fine.

2016
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:46,540
Like a neighbor's boy.

2017
01:35:46,540 --> 01:35:47,380
Bang your head
 against the wall,

2018
01:35:47,380 --> 01:35:48,150
but others don't want to--

2019
01:35:48,150 --> 01:35:48,430
JONATHAN: Somewhere
 there is someone's life

2020
01:35:48,430 --> 01:35:49,590
who you are destroying.
 - Fight.

2021
01:35:49,590 --> 01:35:52,420
Others want to change
 them ourselves.

2022
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:54,360
Let others make
 their own choices.

2023
01:35:54,360 --> 01:35:55,390
JONATHAN: Don't do that to him.

2024
01:35:55,390 --> 01:35:56,350
Step aside.

2025
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:57,240
Yeah, step aside

2026
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:59,080
Hello.
 Remember me?

2027
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:05,020
This was about me, wasn't it?

2028
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:10,660
If this is about me, why are
 neither of those two voices

2029
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:11,380
I hear mine?

2030
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,430
It's like the two of you
 are on opposite shores.

2031
01:36:18,430 --> 01:36:19,480
I'm drowning.

2032
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:21,000
And you're yelling
 this way, no, this way.

2033
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:22,400
Grab my life preserver.

2034
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,910
No, come on my boat.
 I'll save you.

2035
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:24,760
No, I'll save you.

2036
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:26,710
Screaming so loudly,
 I hadn't even

2037
01:36:26,710 --> 01:36:30,520
noticed it's the
 two of you pissing,

2038
01:36:30,520 --> 01:36:34,420
shitting, vomiting in the lake
 that makes the water so high.

2039
01:36:37,410 --> 01:36:40,550
I don't need to be saved.

2040
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:41,530
I need to be left alone.

2041
01:36:46,830 --> 01:36:49,140
Out.

2042
01:36:49,140 --> 01:36:50,130
Out.

2043
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:52,000
[SNAPS] Out.

2044
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:52,700
Out.

2045
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:56,050
Out.

2046
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:06,310
I wish I hadn't met Dr.
 Apsey, because, though he

2047
01:37:06,310 --> 01:37:11,120
was very logical
 sounding, he confused me.

2048
01:37:11,120 --> 01:37:14,920
I think people don't want
 to entertain a possibility--

2049
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:16,660
His work is dangerous.

2050
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:18,790
I believe that it's homophobic.

2051
01:37:18,790 --> 01:37:23,500
They do not even want to think
 that a certain possibility is

2052
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:25,180
in the realm of possibilities.

2053
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:30,070
And anyone that might even
 bring that up is an enemy.

2054
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:32,680
If that is a strike against
 me as far as this board

2055
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:34,420
is concerned, so be it.

2056
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:36,370
Why shrink possibilities.

2057
01:37:36,370 --> 01:37:40,070
My intent with the article
 was not to discredit Dr. Apsey.

2058
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:42,390
Have you read the article.

2059
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:45,390
I just present both sides.

2060
01:37:45,390 --> 01:37:48,710
Yes, I understand that this is
 an ethics violation over which

2061
01:37:48,710 --> 01:37:50,870
I can lose my license.

2062
01:37:50,870 --> 01:37:54,750
As a psychologist,
 I never set about--

2063
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:57,940
I think it would
 be a mistake to--

2064
01:37:57,940 --> 01:37:59,980
I think it would be a
 mistake if I lost my license.

2065
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:01,280
I don't think I've
 done anything wrong.

2066
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:04,280
Come embattled with
 another professional.

2067
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:06,530
My record will
 speak for itself.

2068
01:38:06,530 --> 01:38:09,710
Dr. Apsey doesn't need to--

2069
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:15,690
he doesn't need to--

2070
01:38:20,590 --> 01:38:21,700
just be who you want to be.

2071
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:41,650
FRANK: Thank you for
 finally seeing me.

2072
01:38:41,650 --> 01:38:44,880
I have a job
 interview at 2:15.

2073
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:47,700
Talk.

2074
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:48,940
I called because I--

2075
01:38:52,610 --> 01:38:56,140
I want your recipe
 for banana bread.

2076
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:57,540
I wake up some
 mornings and all I want

2077
01:38:57,540 --> 01:39:01,490
is a slice of that lousy bread.

2078
01:39:01,490 --> 01:39:02,290
Still games?

2079
01:39:02,290 --> 01:39:04,060
I'm trying to apologize.

2080
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:06,200
- Get on with it.
 - I'm sorry.

2081
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:11,390
That's it?

2082
01:39:11,390 --> 01:39:12,740
Two words?

2083
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:14,510
After both you and
 Apsey filed complaints

2084
01:39:14,510 --> 01:39:15,440
that became the story.

2085
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:18,240
I couldn't write the article
 without mentioning you.

2086
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:21,170
I'm sorry you lost your license.

2087
01:39:21,170 --> 01:39:22,370
But he's going to lose his too.

2088
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:27,660
What do you do now?

2089
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:31,980
Start over.

2090
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:39,180
Being forced out
 of my career, hey,

2091
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:41,040
prevents a mid-life crisis.

2092
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:44,570
That's the silver lining.

2093
01:39:44,570 --> 01:39:47,010
Some days that's all there is.

2094
01:39:52,890 --> 01:39:54,800
- What you did was unforgivable.
 - Yes.

2095
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:55,990
Forgive me anyway.

2096
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:57,640
- You hurt me.
 - I know.

2097
01:39:57,640 --> 01:39:58,340
You used me.

2098
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:03,800
I know.

2099
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,370
We shouldn't have.
 We did.

2100
01:40:05,370 --> 01:40:06,070
Are we sorry?

2101
01:40:18,100 --> 01:40:20,990
Do you remember
 maybe our 10th date?

2102
01:40:20,990 --> 01:40:23,830
We strolled in this
 park, by this fountain.

2103
01:40:23,830 --> 01:40:25,860
You stood behind me.

2104
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:28,020
Your arms wrapped
 around my chest.

2105
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:33,400
You kneecaps cradled
 the back of my knees.

2106
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:36,240
You kissed my ear.

2107
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:37,820
And I thought you were
 writing true poetry.

2108
01:40:43,050 --> 01:40:45,090
The truth, if it's anywhere
 in me, it's in my body.

2109
01:40:45,090 --> 01:40:45,990
And my body knows.

2110
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:47,150
It's been designed to love--

2111
01:40:47,150 --> 01:40:49,540
One overly ripe
 banana, mush it.

2112
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:50,510
I know we can't go back.

2113
01:40:50,510 --> 01:40:52,380
But we can go forward
 to the future.

2114
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:54,030
Three cups self-rising flour.

2115
01:40:54,030 --> 01:40:55,590
Us, no lie.
 No manipulation.

2116
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:57,500
Self-rising or chew like lead.

2117
01:40:57,500 --> 01:40:58,830
We're capable of
 that, aren't we?

2118
01:40:58,830 --> 01:40:59,870
Sometimes I forget
 the self-rising.

2119
01:40:59,870 --> 01:41:01,140
Listen to me.
 I'm trying to say--

2120
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:03,330
I know what you're
 trying to say.

2121
01:41:03,330 --> 01:41:06,130
Stop it.

2122
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:10,340
Don't say it, please.

2123
01:41:10,340 --> 01:41:13,690
I'm not ready to
 stop hating you--

2124
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:16,120
yet.
 - Yet?

2125
01:41:20,510 --> 01:41:22,030
I like that yet.

2126
01:41:31,330 --> 01:41:34,680
