1
00:01:54,922 --> 00:01:57,220
This is Johnny Phoenix for the XFL,,,

2
00:01:57,558 --> 00:02:02,018
,,,reminding fans here at Prudential
Stadium to be safe on the way home,

3
00:02:10,872 --> 00:02:13,340
Big third down
for the expansion Roadrunners.

4
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:18,478
The playoff hopes hinge on this play.
A lot of pressure on Johnny Phoenix.

5
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,480
As if being the first quarterback to
earn $300 million isn't enough.

6
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,348
Red! Thirty-two!

7
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:31,518
Red! Thirty-two!

8
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:35,360
Run left!

9
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:42,298
Blue! Two, thirty-nine!

10
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,531
Blue!

11
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:55,280
Hut!

12
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:21,432
Get up, Johnny!

13
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:22,768
You all right?

14
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:28,038
The owner wants the best of care.

15
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,082
He'll need it. His 6th cervical
vertebra is crushed.

16
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:33,810
lt may not be as bad
as you think it is.

17
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:46,431
The status? We have a lifetime
contract with a vegetable.

18
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:48,802
Maybe we could trade him to L.A.

19
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:52,998
Okay, l wantyou
to terminate his contract,

20
00:03:54,842 --> 00:03:55,831
Sure.

21
00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:57,271
l'll get right on it.

22
00:03:57,578 --> 00:04:01,275
Sorry, Johnny. You're going
to have to take one for the team.

23
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,033
Do l look any different to you?

24
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,104
Oh, gee.

25
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:29,274
You shaved your mustache.

26
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,876
l never had a mustache.

27
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,803
Then, no.

28
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,140
Johnny Phoenix will play next week,

29
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:39,512
Early diagnosis had him sidelined,,,

30
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,245
,,,but his injuries proved
to be minor,

31
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,287
Good morning, Adam, At 11;00 you
have a VlP client, Michael Drucker,

32
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,325
And by the way, happy birthday,

33
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:49,860
l don't feel different.

34
00:04:51,265 --> 00:04:53,995
-ls Clara up yet?
-She's watching TV with Oliver.

35
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,334
Are you gonna spend all day
looking for wrinkles...

36
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:03,203
...or are you going to get in here
and give me a kiss?

37
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:05,174
l suppose if l have to.

38
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:09,577
Bully! No, you're not getting
any kisses now.

39
00:05:11,018 --> 00:05:13,987
You know, you don't look
any different.

40
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:16,984
No. You look much better
than when we met.

41
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,556
l love you.

42
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:25,498
Lock the door.

43
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,099
Oh, God.

44
00:05:29,103 --> 00:05:31,264
Daddy! Daddy! Happy birthday!

45
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:33,440
You always make Daddy feel so good.

46
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:37,077
You're getting a little old for that.

47
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:38,108
l am not.

48
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:40,212
l meant your father.

49
00:05:40,414 --> 00:05:42,939
-Very funny.
-Come on. l made you breakfast.

50
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:45,209
-Oh, great. l love it.
-Come on, Dad!

51
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:47,683
l can't find you. Where are you?

52
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,754
l'm right behind you, Dad.

53
00:05:49,957 --> 00:05:51,356
Hiding under the table.

54
00:05:52,627 --> 00:05:56,961
Because ofshorterlife spans,
these family members break ourhearts,

55
00:05:57,198 --> 00:06:01,567
Should accident, illness orage
end yourpet's natural life,,,

56

58
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,348

59
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:18,017
l'll take banana-flavored. Thank you.

60
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:21,316
l love this card. Beautiful.

61
00:06:21,522 --> 00:06:24,650
Dad, can l have a Sim-Pal
for your birthday?

62
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,517
You want a gift on my birthday?

63
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:30,219
So you won't feel guilty
you're the only one getting something.

64
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:32,898
-What's a Sim-Pal?
-A life-size doll.

65
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,933
A make-believe friend
that grows real hair...

66
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:38,665
...and can do a lot of stuff.

67
00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:42,943
Can't your real friends grow real hair
and do lots of stuff?

68
00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:45,305
Yeah, but they all have Sim-Pals.

69
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:46,639
Ask your mommy.

70
00:06:46,847 --> 00:06:48,781
You're the greatest, Dad.

71
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:54,378
Mommy! Mommy!
l'm gonna get a Sim-Pal!

72
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:04,964
You are getting low on milk,

73
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,461
Thank you for ordering milk,

74
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:10,760
You're getting so fast.

75
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:12,595
lnto the car.

76
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,771
Very nice. Bye-bye.

77
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:16,701
See you.

78
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:22,846
What's going on?

79
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,575
l had a breakfast of champions today.

80
00:07:25,786 --> 00:07:28,687
Destination Double X CharterAirport
selected,

81
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:32,052
She wouldn't stop talking.
My virtual girlfriend talks...

82
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,624
...but l can turn her off.

83
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,455
You and your virtual girls.

84
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,996
You're a grown man, and your primary
relationship is with software.

85
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:43,602
lf your senses say there's a hot
chick on your lap, there is one.

86
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:46,364
l don't have to look any further.

87
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:51,204
They invented the Laser Razor.
No nicks or cuts. You should use it.

88
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:55,475
l like the old-fashioned kind.
They remind me l'm still alive.

89
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,083
You want to hang out at Kelly's
after work?

90
00:07:58,753 --> 00:08:01,950
l know that Natalie is throwing me
a surprise party.

91
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,754
-Why do you say that?
-l told her you told.

92
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:07,586
-No, you didn't.
-Oh, yes.

93
00:08:07,928 --> 00:08:09,122
Why did you do that?

94
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,197
l didn't. l just wanted to know
and now l know.

95
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,389
l was that easy.

96
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:16,866
Your destination, Double X Charter
Airport, is ahead,

97
00:08:17,605 --> 00:08:20,506
OnStar will now disengage
automatic drive,

98
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,175
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

99
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:25,311
Manual drive engaged,

100
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:30,609
Do me a favor at the party.

101
00:08:30,818 --> 00:08:34,185
Don't get drunk and set the drapes on
fire? You already told me.

102
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,980
That too.

103
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,624
What l was going to say was
around 1 1 :30...

104
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,920
...l want you to start singing really
loud, ''Happy Birthday.''

105
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:45,064
-For what?
-The way you sing...

106
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:46,824
...it'll clear the place.

107
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:50,697
l get it. You and Natalie have
a little private party planned.

108
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,635
Good morning, Rosie.
Good morning, everybody.

109
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:56,866
Henry checked out the remote.
Says you'll love it.

110
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:58,473
They came in.

111
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:00,306
This is great. Look at this.

112
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,710
And Drucker's office called.
Guess what?

113
00:09:03,984 --> 00:09:04,814
They canceled.

114
00:09:05,052 --> 00:09:07,646
No. We're going to be tested
for drugs and alcohol.

115
00:09:08,055 --> 00:09:10,649
So? Oh, this is cool.

116
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:12,552
We're going to be tested?

117
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:15,728
Not you guys. Just us pilots.

118
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,190
Look at this. The new remote came in.
Out goes the old one.

119
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,837
Get rid of it! Adam, this is Tripp.
lt's his first time with us.

120
00:09:24,038 --> 00:09:25,403
-Welcome.
-How you doing?

121
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,335
Adam? Natalie's on line one.

122
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,578
What's up, honey? You look upset.

123
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,606
Oh, Adam,

124
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:40,781
ljust talked to the vet,,,

125
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:43,081
,,,and they had to put Oliver
to sleep,

126
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:44,688
What? He wasn't that sick.

127
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:48,224
l know, l know, But apparently
he had some kind of,,,

128
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:52,593
,,,highly infectious virus, They
had to put him down, lt's the law,

129
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,563
Oliver was licking Clara's face.

130
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:57,100
Don't worry,
l asked the same thing,,,

131
00:09:57,304 --> 00:10:00,933
,,,and the virus is harmless
to humans, So, she's fine,

132
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,337
This'll break her heart,
you know that.

133
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,211
No, it won't,

134
00:10:07,181 --> 00:10:09,115

science sleep in my daughter's bed.

137
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:17,615
-lt's not dangerous,
-No.

138
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,520
Oliver can live in our memories.

139
00:10:19,727 --> 00:10:22,218
She's only 8,
She won't understand that,

140
00:10:22,563 --> 00:10:24,531
lt's the natural process of life.

141
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:28,133
You're born, you live and you die.
She has to learn about it.

142
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:30,826
But not on yourbirthday,

143
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:32,232
l appreciate that.

144
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:34,702
-Will you do it?
-No.

145
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:36,604
Thank you, And Clara thanks you,

Good. Any questions?

159
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:47,706
l got a question.
How many of you have RePets?

160
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:50,581
-l have a dog.
-l got a snake.

161
00:11:50,784 --> 00:11:53,446
-At least know somebody who has one?
-l get your point.

-l know somebody.
-l was just asking.

163
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:03,929
You scared me.

00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:05,564
-You proud of yourself?
-Very.

165
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,233
See you guys!

166
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:18,536
l know you're old-school, but all the
kids today grew up with RePets.

167
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:20,714
These days it's totally normal.

168
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:22,074
Not to me.

169
00:12:22,349 --> 00:12:26,012
Not to you? You want her crying
all night because her dog died?

170
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,209
Where's your heart?

171
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:30,254
-Don't you think it's a little creepy?
-No.

172
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,281
l don't.

173
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:33,327
Let's test the remote. Keep up.

174
00:12:33,327 --> 00:12:35,420
Let's test the remote. Keep up.

175
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,426
All righty. Here we go.

176
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:48,775
These RePets come back, you can't
tell the difference. Trust me.

177
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,773
-l had it done.
-Bullshit.

178
00:12:53,547 --> 00:12:57,176
l'm serious!
Sadie, my cat...she's a RePet.

179
00:12:57,384 --> 00:12:58,578
You had her cloned?

180
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,614
Well, she fell out of my condo window.

181
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:41,160
-You did well.
-Thank you.

182
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,262
How long are you to keep me?

183
00:13:43,464 --> 00:13:44,556
Till 7. Why?

184
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:46,494
Maybe l should check out RePet.

185
00:14:04,017 --> 00:14:06,577
Good morning.
Are you gentlemen the owners?

186
00:14:06,787 --> 00:14:08,482
Yep, that's us.

187
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:11,886
Excellent. Larry Stern,
l'm with Mr. Drucker's advance team.

188
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:16,620
l've got a contract here. You'll find
it pretty standard except for....

189
00:14:19,533 --> 00:14:22,366
-Who was flying that one?
-Me, with the remote control.

190
00:14:22,803 --> 00:14:25,431
We can fly four of these
between the two of us now.

191
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,607
-Amazing.
-You here for the blood test?

192
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:30,736
No. My technician is set up
in your office.

193
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:33,276
These forms are standard except what?

194
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,278
lt has a nondisclosure clause.
During the flight...

195
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:38,713
...you may overhear
Mr. Drucker's phone calls.

196
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,511
Anything from big mergers...

197
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:43,315
...to inside information
on his sports teams.

198
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:46,287
We have a legal obligation
to protect that stuff.

199
00:14:46,493 --> 00:14:48,723
This guy think he's the president?

200
00:14:48,996 --> 00:14:52,454
He considers her to be the world's
second most important person.

201
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:56,092
That's big stuff.

202
00:14:56,503 --> 00:14:58,403
All for a day of snowboarding?

203
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,107
The blood test was agony.
Seriously, l was screaming.

204
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,904
She's kidding. Don't worry about it.

205
00:15:06,246 --> 00:15:08,407
lt doesn't hurt.
Press your thumb here.

206
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:11,409
-Right here?
-Just like that.

207
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,811
-All done.
-Didn't feel a thing.

208
00:15:15,022 --> 00:15:17,047
Now your vision.
Place your chin here.

209
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:18,622
Right here?

210
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:21,984
Do you blood-test all your pilots?

211
00:15:22,196 --> 00:15:24,164
Pilots, drivers, security, assistants.

212
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:27,663
Basically, anyone who comes
in contact with Mr. Drucker.

213
00:15:31,371 --> 00:15:32,463
l press here?

214
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:35,665
And here.

215
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:43,012
Perfect, both of you.

216
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:46,950
After this, l'm going to town
to test a chef and two waiters.

217
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:51,852
The pink copy of the charter contract
is yours.

218
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:53,352
l'll take the rest.

219
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,028
-Here we go.
-Have a nice flight, gentlemen.

220
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:03,503
l can take Drucker. That way,
you'll have time to get Oliver cloned.

221
00:16:03,704 --> 00:16:06,832
l'm not getting the dog cloned.
l'm just gonna check it out.

222
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,804
l know, but once you see it,
you'll say yes.

223
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,910
Deep down inside, you're a softy.

224
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:14,943
They specifically asked for Adam
by name.

225
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:18,811
l know. l also know that the
bodyguards can't tell the difference.

226
00:16:19,086 --> 00:16:20,883
They never got our names.

227
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:22,647
That's true.

228
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:26,587
Adam, l know l screw around a lot,
but when it comes to flying...

229
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:28,727
...you know l'm serious.
l could do it.

230
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:31,159
Go enjoy your birthday.

231
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:35,366
lf you want to be me, try to act
a little bit more manly.

232
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:38,270
Chest out. Stomach in.
There you are.

233
00:16:38,472 --> 00:16:39,871
All right.

234
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:48,345
-All clear.
-l want the Speaker of the House.

235
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,983
Don't mention my name at all.

236
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:54,679
l'm Michael Drucker.
You must be Adam Gibson.

237
00:16:54,922 --> 00:16:57,049
Adam's the name and flying's the game.

238
00:16:57,257 --> 00:17:00,124
Pete Hume says you know the mountains
like nobody else.

239
00:17:00,327 --> 00:17:03,057
That's probably true for everyone
except my partner.

240
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:04,924
l'm looking forward to it.

241
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:07,293
-We all set?
-We've stationed our people--

242
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:09,492
-Don't need the details.
-Yes, sir.

243
00:17:10,837 --> 00:17:12,896
Your snowboard's behind your seat.

244
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:16,598
Dave, look, we gave a lot of money
to his campaign...

245
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,337
...not to mention what l pay
your law firm, so l'm counting on you.

246
00:17:20,547 --> 00:17:21,536
Get me the Speaker.

247
00:17:22,215 --> 00:17:23,477
Good.

248
00:17:23,684 --> 00:17:26,118
Sally, who's next? Okay, put him on.

249
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,116
Hey, you own the Roadrunners, right?

250
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,393
Hey, buddy, wake up.

251
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:17,763
Wake up.

252
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:19,805
We're here. Woodland Mall.

253
00:18:31,084 --> 00:18:32,142
l was asleep.

254
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:40,756
Welcome to Woodland Mall,
Over 1200 retail outlets to serve you,

255
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:45,791
Food court, ground level,
Megaplex theater, 15th level,

256
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:50,163
Stop the cloning. Say no to RePet.

257
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:51,735
Stop the cloning.

258
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:54,505
God doesn't want you to go in there.

259
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,333
Then God shouldn't have killed my dog.

260
00:18:57,544 --> 00:18:58,875
Atheist.

261
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,582
We can clone your four-legged
loved one in a few hours,

262
00:19:03,784 --> 00:19:05,183
How can we do it?

263
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:07,615
lt begins with growing ''blanks'',,,

264
00:19:07,821 --> 00:19:10,312
,,,animal drones
stripped of characteristic DNA,,,

265
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:13,322
,,,in embryonic tanks
at the RePet factory,

266
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:15,051
ln stage two, yourpet's DNA,,,

267
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:18,060
,,,is extracted from a lock of fur
ora drop ofblood,,,

268
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:21,457
,,,then infused on a cellularlevel
into the blank,

269
00:19:21,668 --> 00:19:25,468
ln the final stage, using RePet's
cerebral syncording process,,,

270
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:28,266
,,,all yourpets thoughts,
memories and instincts,,,

271
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:30,841
,,,are transplanted
via the optic nerve,

272
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:34,340
Still can't make up your mind, huh?

273
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,948
You lost a dog, right?

274
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,016
Yes, my daughter's.

275
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,847
What a heartbreak.

276
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:45,218
-What did you say was his name again?
-Oliver.

277
00:19:45,492 --> 00:19:47,392
Oliver's in luck...

278
00:19:47,594 --> 00:19:50,722
...because we're having
a special this week, 20 percent off.

279
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:53,456
-When did Oliver die?
-This morning.

280
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,965
Perfect.
We can do a post-mortem syncording...

281
00:19:56,169 --> 00:19:59,661
...but act fast because there's
a 1 2-hour window on deceased brains.

282
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:02,034
l have a problem with the whole idea.

283
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:05,143
Suppose the clones have no soul
or they're dangerous?

284
00:20:05,612 --> 00:20:08,137
Clone pets are every bit
as safe as real pets.

285
00:20:08,348 --> 00:20:09,508
Plus...

286
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:10,740
...they're insured.

287
00:20:10,951 --> 00:20:12,282
lf it's so safe...

288
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,244
...then why is it against the law
to clone humans?

289
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:18,219
Because the human brain is too
complicated to syncord.

290
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:20,393
You remember the experiment they did?

291
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,427
That's why it didn't work.
Now it's illegal to even try.

292
00:20:24,631 --> 00:20:27,566
But with pets, it's a totally
proven technology.

293
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,226
Your RePet Oliver
will be exactly the same dog.

294
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,497
He'll know the tricks
you taught him...

295
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:37,438
...where the bones are buried--
He won't even know he's a clone.

296
00:20:38,211 --> 00:20:39,610
And did l mention...

297
00:20:39,813 --> 00:20:41,110
...they're insured.

298
00:20:41,314 --> 00:20:42,872
l don't care about insurance.

299
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,519
l care if l can trust my daughter
with an animal with sharp teeth.

300
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:50,081
We can make him smaller.
With softer teeth.

301
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,279
You can?

302
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:55,291
We can even color-coordinate him
to match your decorating scheme.

303
00:20:55,595 --> 00:20:57,529
Sim-Pals, the best friend
money can buy,

304
00:20:57,898 --> 00:20:59,263
Let me think about that.

305
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,934
--who's fun to be with,
Treatyourkids--

306
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:04,198
Look, l might be back.

307
00:21:05,071 --> 00:21:06,231
You'll be back.

308
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:08,600
Your daughter will think
you're the best.

309
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,142
-My sister has two and loves them.
-Good.

310
00:21:12,345 --> 00:21:13,869
Come, let's fix the collar.

311
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,479
There you are.

312
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:17,980
-lt's amazing how real this is.
-l know.

313
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:19,914
My daughter will be so excited.

314
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,712
Come, let's go home.

315
00:21:28,395 --> 00:21:29,987
You have called Hank Morgan,

316
00:21:30,197 --> 00:21:32,461
Hi, l'm not here, so leave a message,

317
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,099
Hank, it's me again.

318
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:38,294
What happened to you? l waited at
Kelly's for half an hour. lt's now...

319
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:42,839
-...five past 7.
-l'm Sim-Pal Cindy, What's yourname?

320
00:21:43,143 --> 00:21:46,408
l'm heading home now.
lf you get this message--

321
00:21:46,613 --> 00:21:47,875
Let's be friends,

322
00:21:48,081 --> 00:21:49,378
What's yourname?

323
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,915
Can't you see l'm talking? Quiet.

324
00:21:52,118 --> 00:21:56,987
--head to my house with flowers and a
good excuse, or Natalie will kill you.

325
00:21:57,224 --> 00:22:01,160
l can sing songs,
Would you like to sing with me?

326
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,727
Excuse me, do you know how
to turn this off?

327
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:07,462
My niece has one.
Say, ''Go to sleep, Cindy.''

328
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:10,636
-Go to sleep, Cindy.
-Would you like to sing,,,,

329
00:22:10,837 --> 00:22:12,270
Go to sleep.

330
00:22:21,147 --> 00:22:23,513
Thank you. Thanks for the ride.

331
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,184
Good night.

332
00:22:34,861 --> 00:22:36,852
Clara, sweetie, honey.

333
00:22:37,364 --> 00:22:41,198
Oliver was very sick and he had to be
put down.

334
00:22:44,037 --> 00:22:48,371
Clara, sweetie, honey. Oliver
had to go to heaven.

335
00:22:49,376 --> 00:22:50,707
''Why, Daddy?''

336
00:22:51,211 --> 00:22:53,372
Well, you see, because...

337
00:22:54,714 --> 00:22:56,375
...it's because, uh....

338
00:22:57,217 --> 00:22:59,481
Shit, Oliver! Why'd you have to die?

339
00:23:03,156 --> 00:23:04,384
Oliver?

340
00:23:11,398 --> 00:23:12,729
Natalie.

341
00:23:36,022 --> 00:23:37,182
One...

342
00:23:37,557 --> 00:23:39,149
...two, three!

343
00:23:45,165 --> 00:23:47,429
That's amazing. Look at this cake!

344
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:51,598
Oh, my God.

345
00:24:14,527 --> 00:24:15,858
Adam Gibson?

346
00:24:16,463 --> 00:24:17,452
Who are you?

347
00:24:17,797 --> 00:24:20,197
We have a situation.
Come with us, please.

348
00:24:21,201 --> 00:24:22,793
What the hell is going on?

349
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:25,197
Cooperate and everything will be fine.

350
00:24:25,472 --> 00:24:30,409
Fine? Someone's in my house, eating
my birthday cake and it's not me!

351
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:34,803
We know. There's been a 6th Day
violation. A human was cloned.

352
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:37,843
-That human was you.
-We can help.

353
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:41,086
-Then get him out!
-But you'll have to come with us.

354
00:24:41,821 --> 00:24:45,655
l don't know who the hell
you people are...

355
00:24:46,393 --> 00:24:48,384
-...but l'm going in my house.
-Right.

356
00:24:59,739 --> 00:25:01,730
Oops, Cindy fell down,

357
00:25:02,008 --> 00:25:03,407
Get the doll.

358
00:25:08,581 --> 00:25:09,741
Not here.

359
00:25:22,595 --> 00:25:25,530
l'm Sim-Pal Cindy, What's yourname?

360
00:25:30,103 --> 00:25:32,264
l can play games,

361
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:44,713
Shit.

362
00:25:49,456 --> 00:25:51,549
Wiley, no! Hold your fire!

363
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:52,951
That way! Go!

364
00:25:53,226 --> 00:25:54,625
Vincent, go!

365
00:25:54,961 --> 00:25:56,952
l have a boo-boo,

366
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:15,745
Stop the car!

367
00:26:16,483 --> 00:26:17,575
Stop the car!

368
00:26:20,587 --> 00:26:22,578
Thanks for the suggestion!

369
00:26:24,324 --> 00:26:25,313
Don't even blink.

370
00:26:25,992 --> 00:26:27,983
Oh, God. Someone stole the minivan.

371
00:26:28,328 --> 00:26:30,319
No, they stole my Cadillac.

372
00:26:31,498 --> 00:26:32,658
Oh, no.

373
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,001
Car chase. Cool.

374
00:26:47,113 --> 00:26:49,274
-Who are you?
-l was hired to kill you.

375
00:26:49,682 --> 00:26:51,513
That's all l know.

376
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,011
l'm Sim-Pal Cindy,
What's yourname?

377
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:57,779
Secure child-seat restraint,

378
00:26:58,024 --> 00:26:59,514
Let's be friends,

379
00:27:16,876 --> 00:27:19,310
-Where is this guy?
-l'm Sim-Pal Cindy,

380
00:27:20,313 --> 00:27:21,644
Let's be friends,

381
00:27:22,048 --> 00:27:23,379
What's yourname?

382
00:27:24,717 --> 00:27:26,048
Will you be my mommy?

383
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,650
l don't want to be your mommy!

384
00:27:27,887 --> 00:27:29,377
-Shut up!
-What?

385
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,824
Somebody do something about that doll!

386
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,232
l have a boo-boo,

387
00:27:50,243 --> 00:27:53,235
This is crazy. Why does anyone
want to kill me?

388
00:27:53,746 --> 00:27:55,179
He got home first.

389
00:27:55,415 --> 00:27:58,680
You saw him, he didn't see you.
You're screwed.

390
00:27:58,918 --> 00:28:02,513
He's going to live your boring life
and never be the wiser.

391
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:07,253
Your wife and kid see you two
together, they'll be killed.

392
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:54,133
Goddamn it, Wiley!

393
00:28:55,642 --> 00:28:56,973
Son of a bitch.

394
00:29:15,995 --> 00:29:17,155
Stupid!

395
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,660
Blow out his tires this time!

396
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:29,672
Shit!

397
00:30:11,384 --> 00:30:13,045
That was spectacular.

398
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,731
Son of a bitch.

399
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,501
Hold my belt.

400
00:30:36,242 --> 00:30:37,231
Okay.

401
00:30:41,414 --> 00:30:42,346
You got me?

402
00:30:45,351 --> 00:30:46,579
Little more.

403
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:14,610
Get some people
to look for this guy!

404
00:31:14,881 --> 00:31:18,112
Pick up Wiley and Talia's bodies
and get them to the lab.

405
00:31:36,803 --> 00:31:41,263
l'm Dr, Griffin Weir, Welcome to the
new Weir Organ Transplant Facility,

406
00:31:41,474 --> 00:31:44,170
Thanks for visiting
Replacement Technologies,

407
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,176
Doctor, protesters claim
that cloning human organs,,,

408
00:31:49,382 --> 00:31:51,350
,,,will lead to cloning whole humans,

409
00:31:51,918 --> 00:31:55,479
That's not only illegal, we're years
from the technology to do it.

410
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:58,213
A human was cloned over 1 0 years ago.

411
00:31:58,424 --> 00:32:00,824
And we know the outcome
of that bizarre experiment.

412
00:32:01,327 --> 00:32:05,627
lf you recall, the Supreme Court
ordered the clone be destroyed...

413
00:32:05,832 --> 00:32:08,266
...and l think that was
the humane thing to do.

414
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,493
lt led to laws against
human cloning...

415
00:32:10,703 --> 00:32:14,002
...and set back the course of
legitimate research by years.

416
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,331
Mr. Drucker! You gave--

417
00:32:16,676 --> 00:32:18,837
This is Dr. Weir's night, okay?

418
00:32:19,178 --> 00:32:22,011
ls it true you want to get
the 6th Day laws repealed?

419
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:25,011
Dr. Weir is interested in medicine,
not politics.

420
00:32:25,284 --> 00:32:29,118
Mr. Drucker, the protesters claim you
run RePet at a loss...

421
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:31,482
...to soften people
up to human cloning.

422
00:32:31,691 --> 00:32:34,956
You know, we shouldn't forget
that not long ago...

423
00:32:35,628 --> 00:32:38,256
...there were almost no more fish
left in the ocean...

424
00:32:38,464 --> 00:32:41,524
...and half the world's population
faced the threat of hunger.

425
00:32:41,734 --> 00:32:44,225
Cloning technology turned that around.

426
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:47,803
Extremists won't admit
they'd rather people went hungry...

427
00:32:48,074 --> 00:32:50,975
...than eat cloned fish,
so they yell about human cloning.

428
00:32:51,244 --> 00:32:54,145
Do you think human cloning laws
should be changed?

429
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,507
Suppose a 1 0-year-old boy is in the
hospital, dying of liver cancer.

430
00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:00,515
Thanks to Dr. Weir's work...

431
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,449
...we can save that boy.

432
00:33:02,655 --> 00:33:05,556
ln the next bed lies
another 1 0-year-old boy...

433
00:33:05,758 --> 00:33:08,090
...whose parents love him
just as much...

434
00:33:08,294 --> 00:33:10,922
...only he has
an inoperable brain tumor.

435
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,564
You cannot clone a brain.

436
00:33:13,766 --> 00:33:16,860
The only way to save him
would be to clone the whole person.

437
00:33:17,303 --> 00:33:21,433
How do you tell that boy's parents
that we can save the first boy...

438
00:33:21,674 --> 00:33:24,837
...but the research that would have
saved their son wasn't done...

439
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:28,547
...because of a law passed by
frightened politicians a decade ago?

440
00:33:29,015 --> 00:33:30,846
So, what does that mean?

441
00:33:31,183 --> 00:33:32,514
Enjoy the party.

442
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,954
-Looks like you needed rescuing.
-Yes, l did. Thank you.

443
00:33:44,196 --> 00:33:48,860
Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!

444
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:53,695
Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!

445
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:57,106
Hey, boss!

446
00:33:58,044 --> 00:34:00,535
Johnny. How's my star quarterback?

447
00:34:01,981 --> 00:34:05,974
l'd say l felt like a million bucks,
but l'd hate to take a pay cut.

448
00:34:06,552 --> 00:34:08,144
Don't remind me, all right?

449
00:34:08,354 --> 00:34:11,152
That was one nasty hit you took
last week.

450
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:14,325
Be careful. We don't want you
getting killed.

451
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,222
Katherine? Are you all right?

452
00:34:17,496 --> 00:34:19,896
l'm just feeling
like l don't quite belong.

453
00:34:20,566 --> 00:34:22,397
But l'm fine. Really.

454
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:24,066
No, you're not.

455
00:34:24,904 --> 00:34:26,394
Should l call Dr. Stevens?

456
00:34:26,672 --> 00:34:29,573
No, no, no.
l just overdid it, that's all.

457
00:34:30,076 --> 00:34:32,067
l'll get a car to take you home.

458
00:34:32,345 --> 00:34:33,403
Thank you.

459
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:40,408
Mr. Speaker? Thank you so much
for coming. Champagne?

460
00:34:40,753 --> 00:34:43,722
-That was quite a speech.
-You heard that?

461
00:34:43,923 --> 00:34:45,254
Sorry l got carried away.

462
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:47,856
Your words meant a great deal to me.

463
00:34:48,094 --> 00:34:51,928
As it happens, l have a son
with an inoperable tumor of the brain.

464
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:55,698
Oh, my God. l'm so sorry, sir.

465
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:59,029
lt must have been in my subconscious,
knowing you were here.

466
00:34:59,238 --> 00:35:01,331
No, no, it's all right.

467
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,098
Gave me a lot to think about.

468
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:05,933
lt gave me a different view
of the subject.

469
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:08,610
Mr. Speaker...

470
00:35:08,948 --> 00:35:12,440
...could l offer you a glass of brandy
in my office upstairs?

471
00:35:22,628 --> 00:35:24,459
l was 0 when Billy was born.

472
00:35:25,064 --> 00:35:27,965
l didn't know if l wanted
another kid so late.

473
00:35:28,634 --> 00:35:31,296
But now l love him so damn much.

474
00:35:35,141 --> 00:35:37,974
lf there were something
we could do for Billy...

475
00:35:39,645 --> 00:35:41,806
,,,only it was highly illegal,,,

476
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:43,778
...would you consider it?

477
00:35:43,983 --> 00:35:46,645
Of course l would.
That's the same hypothetical--

478
00:35:46,986 --> 00:35:49,648
No, no. Don't answer so fast.

479
00:35:50,823 --> 00:35:54,657
You'd face a minimum sentence of
40 years if it ever came out.

480
00:35:54,994 --> 00:35:56,256
But he'd be cured?

481
00:35:56,495 --> 00:35:58,156
He'd be exactly the same.

482
00:35:58,831 --> 00:35:59,820
Perfect health,

483
00:36:00,499 --> 00:36:01,932
Never even have to know.

484
00:36:03,436 --> 00:36:05,267
But if the secret came out,,,

485
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,165
...with the law now...

486
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,772
,,,he'd be put to sleep
like a rabid dog,

487
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:12,936
He'd be destroyed,
like a horse with a broken leg.

488
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:15,613
And ifit never came out?

489
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:18,839
Or if the laws were changed one day?

490
00:36:22,021 --> 00:36:24,512
Billy wouldn't have
anything to worry about.

491
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:54,887
l beg you.

492
00:36:54,887 --> 00:36:56,047
l beg you.

493
00:36:56,322 --> 00:36:59,223
Go to my house and pick up
my wife and daughter.

494
00:36:59,492 --> 00:37:01,722
lf l go there, they'll kill them both.

495
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:05,320
You made a different report
an hour ago.

496
00:37:05,564 --> 00:37:06,656
No, l didn't.

497
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:09,265
According to this, you did.

498
00:37:09,468 --> 00:37:11,231
That must have been the clone.

499
00:37:13,572 --> 00:37:16,268
Look, l know it sounds crazy.

500
00:37:16,475 --> 00:37:18,568
l can hardly believe it myself.

501
00:37:18,844 --> 00:37:21,005
-Was your car stolen or not?
-Yes.

502
00:37:21,247 --> 00:37:23,841
-So you did report it?
-No, l took it.

503
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,243
You stole your own car?

504
00:37:25,518 --> 00:37:29,352
l'm a court-appointed virtual
attorney. You don't have to answer.

505
00:37:29,588 --> 00:37:32,022
ls my client being charged
with auto theft?

506
00:37:32,258 --> 00:37:33,589
l didn't steal it! lt's mine!

507
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:35,918
He claims it was filed by his clone.

508
00:37:36,195 --> 00:37:39,028
l see. Loading virtual psychiatrist.

509
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:43,090
Mr. Gibson,
what seems to be the trouble?

510
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:46,267
Go through it now with him?

511
00:37:46,539 --> 00:37:48,939
You're avoiding
talking about your parents.

512
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:52,200
lmagine: Two turtles
are walking through the desert--

513
00:37:52,444 --> 00:37:53,433
Shut up!

514
00:38:00,452 --> 00:38:01,282
What?

515
00:38:02,788 --> 00:38:05,552
-Are you going to help me or not?
-Of course we are.

516
00:38:05,791 --> 00:38:09,124
Medical alert transmitted,
Awaiting data,

517
00:38:09,962 --> 00:38:13,125
Wait in here. l'll come get you
as soon as we have news.

518
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:21,831
Clones.

519
00:38:56,108 --> 00:38:58,269
He saw himself at his house tonight.

520
00:38:58,477 --> 00:39:00,206
Which was our mistake, not his.

521
00:39:00,446 --> 00:39:01,777
Excuse me.

522
00:39:02,781 --> 00:39:04,442
He's at precinct seven.

523
00:39:04,783 --> 00:39:07,775
Can you hurry Talia and Wiley along?
l'll need them both.

524
00:40:22,027 --> 00:40:23,858
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

525
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:36,702
Piece of shit Wiley.
l'm gonna kill him. Where is he?

526
00:40:38,377 --> 00:40:40,208
He's still cooking.

527
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:42,312
Son of a bitch.

528
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,320
l look like crap.

529
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:55,159
Do you have any idea how much
my hair treatments cost?

530
00:40:55,394 --> 00:40:56,986
How much does Gibson know?

531
00:40:57,229 --> 00:41:01,029
That he's been cloned and we'll
kill anyone who sees them together.

532
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:03,224
What's that? What?

533
00:41:04,136 --> 00:41:07,731
Does Drucker know you're talking
about killing innocent people?

534
00:41:08,374 --> 00:41:09,773
Relax. lt's just a threat.

535
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:12,067
Of course, we'd never actually do it.

536
00:41:14,046 --> 00:41:15,536
Try to have a good night.

537
00:41:15,748 --> 00:41:18,911
You do your hair.
l'll take Wiley and Vincent.

538
00:41:19,251 --> 00:41:21,742
l've got to pierce my damn ears again.

539
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:28,126
Officials blame the latest strike
by majorleague players,,,

540
00:41:28,327 --> 00:41:30,557
,,,entering its 4th year
and a lack,,,

541
00:41:30,763 --> 00:41:35,097
,,,of fan identification with teams
in the Series for the dismal ratings,

542
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:38,100
Shit.

543
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,712
Oh, no.

544
00:42:05,964 --> 00:42:07,295
Now what?

545
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:10,799
lt feels tight all across here...

546
00:42:11,136 --> 00:42:13,297
...where the tires ran over me.

547
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:16,631
You were run over by two cars
and your chest was crushed.

548
00:42:16,975 --> 00:42:19,535
Exactly. l mean, no wonder, right?

549
00:42:19,878 --> 00:42:20,936
lt's in your mind.

550
00:42:21,146 --> 00:42:23,205
Completely crushed.

551
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,746
As in dead.

552
00:42:25,484 --> 00:42:28,647
As in you have
a totally new chest now.

553
00:42:29,488 --> 00:42:31,149
Then why is it hard to breathe?

554
00:42:32,658 --> 00:42:33,989
Tell you what.

555
00:42:34,193 --> 00:42:36,491
Why don't you just stay out here?
Relax.

556
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,821
The fresh air will do you good.

557
00:42:39,631 --> 00:42:42,725
State and government officials
in Washington, D,C,,,

558
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,836
,,,are openly dismissive
of the Microsoftproposal,

559
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:50,932
This amounts to an attempt by
Microsoft to buy a state of the Union,

560
00:42:51,176 --> 00:42:53,667
Nothing in our Constitution
orhistory,,,

561
00:42:54,012 --> 00:42:56,674
,,,offers the remotest legal theory,,,

562
00:42:56,949 --> 00:43:00,009
,,,by which a corporation can,
in effect, own a state,

563
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:12,730
But if he goes off his medication,
the paranoid delusions come back.

564
00:43:18,403 --> 00:43:23,238
Very sad. Because at other times,
he seems almost rational.

565
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,141
Gibson!

566
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,238
Gibson!

567
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:08,950
-You're dead.
-No.

568
00:44:10,756 --> 00:44:11,950
You're dead.

569
00:44:21,934 --> 00:44:23,925
Try to stay dead this time.

570
00:44:32,611 --> 00:44:34,078
Hank, it's me again,

571
00:44:34,279 --> 00:44:35,940
What happened to you?

572
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:39,116
l waited forhalfan hourat Kelly's,

573
00:44:39,318 --> 00:44:40,842
lt's now five past 7,

574
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,714
l'm heading home, okay?

575
00:44:48,627 --> 00:44:50,891
He's fine. He's okay.
He's our associate.

576
00:44:51,296 --> 00:44:53,059
Gibson must have knocked him out.

577
00:44:53,298 --> 00:44:55,892
Knocked him out?
He looks dead to me, doc.

578
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:00,131
No. Pulse is strong.

579
00:45:00,405 --> 00:45:04,808
He'll be up and around in no time.
We'll get him to the hospital.

580
00:45:05,143 --> 00:45:06,303
Easy.

581
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,739
Let us know if you find Gibson.

582
00:45:14,553 --> 00:45:16,453
Honey, l'm home.

583
00:45:18,657 --> 00:45:20,318
Darling, where are you?

584
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,650
Hi, sugar.

585
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:22,985
Hello, my love.

586
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,093
Have you been working out?

587
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:30,828
-You look so good.
-Thank you.

588
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:33,003
l recorded your sports programs.

589
00:45:33,205 --> 00:45:35,264
Maybe we can watch them together.

590
00:45:35,507 --> 00:45:36,667
l'd like that.

591
00:45:37,009 --> 00:45:39,170
Or should l just take this off now?

592
00:45:39,678 --> 00:45:41,509
No. Hold your horses.

593
00:45:48,854 --> 00:45:53,018
Oh, Hank, l think it's so sexy
when you go right to the chair.

594
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:54,347
l know you do.

595
00:46:00,198 --> 00:46:03,031
You're gonna have to
zip me up, sweetheart.

596
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:06,969
Careful with the merchandise.

597
00:46:10,709 --> 00:46:12,370
Hold on, please!

598
00:46:15,547 --> 00:46:17,412
-Have they been here?
-Who?

599
00:46:18,183 --> 00:46:19,980
Hello, Adam. Would you like a beer?

600
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,221
l'm sorry l missed the party, but...

601
00:46:25,557 --> 00:46:29,789
...all of a sudden it's 1 1 :00
and l wound up at Kelly's.

602
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,695
-You missed my party?
-Not on purpose.

603
00:46:32,898 --> 00:46:37,198
lt was sort of weird. l feel
terrible. l don't know what happened.

604
00:46:37,402 --> 00:46:41,463
You feel terrible? l lost my wife,
my daughter and my life tonight.

605
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,729
--special dance.

606
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:44,203
Hank, listen.

607
00:46:44,409 --> 00:46:45,467
l need your help.

608
00:46:46,745 --> 00:46:48,337
Not now, cupcake!

609
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,514
What going on? l don't understand.

610
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,149
That's a real gun.

611
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:58,246
What, what's going--?

612
00:47:10,102 --> 00:47:12,593
Jesus! What are you gonna do?
Kill my cat?

613
00:47:13,271 --> 00:47:15,102
What the hell is going on?

614
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,932
lf you weren't at my party,
then you didn't see him.

615
00:47:19,177 --> 00:47:20,508
Who's ''him''?

616
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:42,364
Jesus H. Christ. l said
get your dog cloned, not yourself.

617
00:47:42,701 --> 00:47:44,692
What are you going to do?

618
00:47:45,036 --> 00:47:46,697
Take my life back.

619
00:47:46,972 --> 00:47:48,371
You're going to kill him?

620
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,803
Why not? He's not real.
Plus, there's no law against it.

621
00:47:52,043 --> 00:47:53,533
You're not serious.

622
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:55,076
l'm dead serious.

623
00:47:57,482 --> 00:47:59,814
But look at him.
He looks just like you.

624
00:48:00,018 --> 00:48:02,748
Technically, this could be
committing suicide.

625
00:48:03,488 --> 00:48:05,046
But he's not me.

626
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,656
He's not even human.

627
00:48:06,992 --> 00:48:11,156
Wait a second. How do l know
he's not you and you're not him?

628
00:48:11,496 --> 00:48:14,090
Look at him.
He's even a shitty carpenter.

629
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:17,498
-Let me see your chin.
-My chin?

630
00:48:17,836 --> 00:48:19,997
-You cut yourself shaving.
-Here.

631
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:24,337
Okay, it's there. You're you.

632
00:48:54,706 --> 00:48:56,139
l couldn't do it.

633
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,199
Over here.

634
00:49:03,949 --> 00:49:05,678
l have a little something for you.

635
00:49:06,017 --> 00:49:07,951
-ls Clara asleep?
-Yes, she is.

636
00:49:17,028 --> 00:49:18,495
He's grabbing her ass.

637
00:49:18,697 --> 00:49:20,858
l like how cigars make you feel.

638
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,492
Daddy?

639
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,842
What are you doing out here?

640
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,010
l had a bad dream.

641
00:49:41,586 --> 00:49:44,419
l'll take you back to bed. Come on.

642
00:49:44,756 --> 00:49:47,088
-Fireman.
-Fireman, right.

643
00:49:48,593 --> 00:49:49,753
Wait here.

644
00:49:54,266 --> 00:49:55,597
Cigar, sir?

645
00:49:56,935 --> 00:49:58,425
l can't wait.

646
00:50:04,943 --> 00:50:06,774
-How do you like it?
-This is so good.

647
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,034
Want to try some?

648
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,943
No. Smoking's illegal,
and l'm a mother-- All right.

649
00:50:19,457 --> 00:50:21,721
Sweetheart, l'm sorry about the RePet.

650
00:50:22,961 --> 00:50:24,622
lt's all right.

651
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,119
Dad?

652
00:50:26,464 --> 00:50:28,125
Did Oliver die?

653
00:50:28,466 --> 00:50:30,058
ls he a RePet?

654
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,233
Why do you say that?

655
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,131
You locked him outside.

656
00:50:34,472 --> 00:50:37,134
l did? Oh, l'm so sorry.

657
00:50:37,475 --> 00:50:39,807
l haven't been myself lately.

658
00:50:52,824 --> 00:50:55,486
All right. You go to sleep now.

659
00:50:55,827 --> 00:50:57,158
Close your eyes.

660
00:50:58,997 --> 00:51:02,262
When was the last time we did it
in the back of the car?

661
00:51:03,001 --> 00:51:05,333
We should smoke cigars more often.

662
00:51:19,918 --> 00:51:21,010
Mr. Gibson?

663
00:51:21,386 --> 00:51:24,014
-Who are you?
-Millennium Security. Sorry to--

664
00:51:24,222 --> 00:51:25,849
You got any l.D.?

665
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:27,113
Of course.

666
00:51:30,195 --> 00:51:33,528
Sorry l was a little jumpy
but we had a break-in earlier.

667
00:51:33,798 --> 00:51:34,958
We know.

668
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,200
Your car was found in the river.

669
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,699
They find the bastard that stole it?

670
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:43,030
Relax. He's a friend of mine.

671
00:51:44,442 --> 00:51:45,534
Sorry about this.

672
00:51:46,111 --> 00:51:47,601
Nice 'do.

673
00:51:48,446 --> 00:51:50,607
He's here to help me fix the garage.

674
00:51:50,882 --> 00:51:51,940
Heel!

675
00:51:52,617 --> 00:51:53,948
Now what?

676
00:51:54,452 --> 00:51:55,612
Go see.

677
00:51:55,954 --> 00:51:57,387
Sorry, but he's a RePet.

678
00:51:57,622 --> 00:52:02,559
He was a good watchdog. Now he lets
my car get stolen and barks.

679
00:52:02,894 --> 00:52:04,054
l hate clones.

680
00:52:07,232 --> 00:52:09,564
Well, we'll keep an eye
on your property.

681
00:52:12,637 --> 00:52:15,071
l'll sleep better
knowing you're around.

682
00:52:15,306 --> 00:52:16,603
Try to have a good night.

683
00:52:16,908 --> 00:52:18,899
-Good night.
-Take it easy.

684
00:52:25,483 --> 00:52:26,643
Hide.

685
00:52:32,323 --> 00:52:33,984
Stop it, Oliver.

686
00:52:38,663 --> 00:52:39,994
Stop it.

687
00:52:44,669 --> 00:52:48,002
Gee, you're glitchy today. Come on.

688
00:53:00,185 --> 00:53:03,677
Good Oliver. That was a bad idea.

689
00:53:05,523 --> 00:53:09,789
-Let's get out of here.
-We can't leave them with that thing.

690
00:53:14,866 --> 00:53:17,027
Those were the guys trying to kill me.

691
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:20,398
lt's dangerous for Natalie and Clara
if l hang around.

692
00:53:30,048 --> 00:53:32,039
Darling, you're still awake.

693
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,383
l wanted to wait up for you.

694
00:53:35,887 --> 00:53:36,876
Thank you.

695
00:53:37,155 --> 00:53:39,817
And l wanted to spend time
with these flowers.

696
00:53:40,158 --> 00:53:42,649
lt took me 1 7 generations
to get this right.

697
00:53:42,894 --> 00:53:44,987
lf you had told me, l could have--

698
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:48,324
l know. Engineered it
in half an hour.

699
00:53:50,068 --> 00:53:52,901
l'm not in that much of a hurry,
Griffin.

700
00:53:55,006 --> 00:53:57,236
Want to get a cup of tea,
then go upstairs?

701
00:53:58,076 --> 00:53:59,236
Yeah.

702
00:54:00,078 --> 00:54:02,239
That's a good idea. Let's do that.

703
00:54:11,256 --> 00:54:12,746
lt's okay.

704
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:16,691
Stay calm.

705
00:54:18,196 --> 00:54:19,788
Stay very, very calm.

706
00:54:20,098 --> 00:54:21,065
What a night.

707
00:54:21,266 --> 00:54:23,757
That was the longest night in my life.

708
00:54:27,705 --> 00:54:29,400
Hello, Adam.

709
00:54:29,607 --> 00:54:31,837
l'm a one-man Virtual Girl...

710
00:54:32,043 --> 00:54:34,637
...but if you insert
the installation disk....

711
00:54:35,547 --> 00:54:37,174
-What was that?
-Nothing.

712
00:54:37,382 --> 00:54:40,579
l felt fingers going for my zipper.
That's disgusting.

713
00:54:40,785 --> 00:54:45,313
That's disgusting? l had to look away
when you and Natalie were--

714
00:54:46,224 --> 00:54:48,215
The.... You want a beer?

715
00:54:49,561 --> 00:54:52,496
You saw the clone do something
with Natalie.

716
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,163
They did nothing.

717
00:54:54,399 --> 00:54:58,335
-That's not what l would have done.
-What would you have done?

718
00:54:58,570 --> 00:54:59,901
l would have....

719
00:55:02,574 --> 00:55:03,506
Nothing.

720
00:55:03,741 --> 00:55:07,074
Well, that's what they did.
You know...nothing.

721
00:55:07,412 --> 00:55:09,903
Shit. ln the goddamn minivan.

722
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:11,341
ln the minivan.

723
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:14,574
You know what tobacco does to people.

724
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,252
He smoked my stogie too?

725
00:55:17,021 --> 00:55:18,079
The bastard.

726
00:55:18,423 --> 00:55:19,913
That son of a bitch.

727
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:23,024
Son of a bitch smoked your stogie.

728
00:55:23,428 --> 00:55:25,259
She couldn't tell it wasn't me?

729
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,431
lt didn't look like it.
l mean, she seemed...

730
00:55:29,601 --> 00:55:30,932
...happy.

731
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,862
You have no idea what it felt like
seeing her with him.

732
00:55:35,106 --> 00:55:36,869
l should have just killed him.

733
00:55:37,108 --> 00:55:41,204
lt could have been worse.
At least she's not cheating on you.

734
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:46,205
Don't move!

735
00:55:48,953 --> 00:55:49,942
Tripp!

736
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,779
l'm not after you.

737
00:55:52,624 --> 00:55:53,955
Back away.

738
00:55:56,961 --> 00:55:58,451
Back away.

739
00:55:59,297 --> 00:56:00,628
Why did you do that?

740
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:04,699
Don't do anything stupid, now.
That's as far as you go.

741
00:56:06,638 --> 00:56:07,969
ls that you, Hank?

742
00:56:38,536 --> 00:56:39,764
Hank!

743
00:56:44,008 --> 00:56:45,839
Hey, Adam.

744
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:49,170
ls Hank sleeping on the floor again?

745
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,772
That's so cute.

746
00:57:17,875 --> 00:57:21,367
On the sixth day, God created man.
On the sixth day....

747
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:26,708
On the sixth day, God created man.
God created man on the sixth day.

748
00:57:28,386 --> 00:57:30,047
Why did you kill my friend?

749
00:57:30,888 --> 00:57:33,982
Hank Morgan was
an abomination to God.

750
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:36,319
He was a clone.

751
00:57:36,561 --> 00:57:37,892
He was no clone.

752
00:57:38,096 --> 00:57:40,155
The real Hank Morgan died
this afternoon.

753
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,997
l killed him.

754
00:57:43,568 --> 00:57:44,694
So l could...

755
00:57:44,902 --> 00:57:46,563
...so l could kill Drucker.

756
00:57:46,904 --> 00:57:49,839
Drucker isn't dead.
lt would be all over the news.

757
00:57:50,074 --> 00:57:51,837
Open your eyes.

758
00:57:52,043 --> 00:57:53,237
Drucker's a clone.

759
00:57:53,578 --> 00:57:58,242
Dr. Weir cloned Drucker.
Dr. Weir cloned your friend.

760
00:57:59,417 --> 00:58:00,850
Dr. Weir cloned you.

761
00:58:06,924 --> 00:58:08,516
They found us.

762
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:11,119
Shoot me in the head.

763
00:58:11,329 --> 00:58:13,524
-What--
-We have people at Weir's lab!

764
00:58:13,731 --> 00:58:16,757
l know who they are.
They scan my brain, they'll be killed.

765
00:58:19,237 --> 00:58:20,795
Shoot me.

766
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,028
God forgive me.

767
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:49,452
Doesn't anyone stay dead anymore?

768
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,786
Who are you people?

769
00:59:57,268 --> 00:59:58,758
l,D, required,

770
01:00:00,104 --> 01:00:01,594
Use biometric reader,,,

771
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,831
,,,to verify identification,,,

772
01:00:04,175 --> 01:00:07,941
,,,or the alarm will sound
in 10 seconds, Ten,,,

773
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,477
-He shot my foot!

Stand by,

779
01:00:23,094 --> 01:00:24,755
Systems accessed,

780
01:00:25,296 --> 01:00:26,263
Gibson!

781
01:00:27,265 --> 01:00:28,596
Select destination,

782
01:00:35,806 --> 01:00:37,137
You're gonna pay!

783
01:00:37,808 --> 01:00:39,776
Those were brand-new boots!

784
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,242
Dad? You're coming
to my recital, right?

785
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:55,074
Of course. l never miss
your recitals.

786
01:01:55,353 --> 01:01:56,684
l love you.

787
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:59,253
You're the greatest, Dad,

788
01:02:07,431 --> 01:02:10,264
Unless herpseudomonas infection
clears up,,,

789
01:02:10,668 --> 01:02:13,262
...l'm afraid there's
nothing we can do.

790
01:02:15,339 --> 01:02:17,398
What about her DNA scan?

791
01:02:18,509 --> 01:02:20,670
Came up with cystic fibrosis.

792
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:21,934
Cystic fibrosis?

793
01:02:22,179 --> 01:02:25,580
Which is impossible, considering
it's a childhood disease...

794
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:28,115
...and she would have been dead
30 years ago.

795
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,480
We're running the scan again.

796
01:02:31,522 --> 01:02:35,481
No, l'll do it at the clinic.
lf you could give us a moment, please.

797
01:02:37,028 --> 01:02:38,791
Darling. Sweetheart.

798
01:02:39,363 --> 01:02:42,127
We're having you transferred
to my clinic.

799
01:02:42,533 --> 01:02:45,195
No. l'd like to stay here.

800
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:50,134
l can help you at the clinic. lf you
stay here, there's nothing l can do.

801
01:02:50,408 --> 01:02:52,638
l know, dear. l'll die.

802
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:54,138
Yes.

803
01:02:54,478 --> 01:02:55,809
Katherine, please.

804
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,138
Listen to me.

805
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:59,749
Katherine died  years ago.

806
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:05,149
The feelings l have aren't mine.
They're hers.

807
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,319
Katherine, listen.

808
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:15,488
Don't do this.

809
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,163
l need you so much. l need you.

810
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,832
l'm not afraid, Griffin.

811
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,672
l want to die.

812
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:28,668
My time has already passed.

813
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,011
My love.

814
01:03:33,517 --> 01:03:35,985
What am l to do without you?

815
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,176
What?

816
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:42,356
You just water my flowers...

817
01:03:43,194 --> 01:03:44,525
...okay?

818
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:54,364
Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!

819
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:59,039
Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!

820
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,641
Thanks for visiting
Replacement Technologies,

821
01:04:01,846 --> 01:04:03,404
We're in the business oflife,

822
01:04:04,348 --> 01:04:07,545
Welcome to the new home of the
Weir Organ Transplant Facility,,,

823
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:10,149
,,,here at Replacement Technologies,

824
01:04:23,367 --> 01:04:25,392
Excuse me, sir.
l've got to check that.

825
01:04:27,171 --> 01:04:29,332
Sure. Help yourself.

826
01:04:31,041 --> 01:04:32,030
But...

827
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:33,870
...you might want to use these.

828
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:35,067
What's in here?

829
01:04:35,279 --> 01:04:37,611
Lower intestines for Dr. Weir.

830
01:04:37,815 --> 01:04:40,249
He's doing a study
on the flesh-eating virus.

831
01:04:40,518 --> 01:04:42,042
You can open it.

832
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,744
Just try not to breathe.

833
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:49,385
That's okay.

834
01:04:49,593 --> 01:04:50,685
You're cleared.

835
01:04:50,895 --> 01:04:52,260
Thanks.

836
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:04,872
What about herDNA scan?

837
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:07,107
Came up with cystic fibrosis,

838
01:05:07,311 --> 01:05:10,280
Which is impossible considering
it's a childhood disease--

839
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:11,641
--dead 30 years ago,

840
01:05:15,219 --> 01:05:16,880
So we're running a new scan,

841
01:05:17,888 --> 01:05:19,879
No, l'll do it at the clinic,

842
01:05:23,394 --> 01:05:26,454
We've had 5 extra years
since you cloned me,

843
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,621
l treasure that,

844
01:05:28,899 --> 01:05:30,196
-Katherine, please,
-No,

845
01:05:30,401 --> 01:05:31,561
Please,

846
01:05:31,902 --> 01:05:33,802
l'm not afraid.

847
01:05:34,638 --> 01:05:36,299
l want to die.

848
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:39,666
My time has already passed.

849
01:06:47,311 --> 01:06:48,642
Can l help you?

850
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:53,881
No. l just dropped my pen.

851
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:57,884
l'm all thumbs today.

852
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,891
Thank you.

853
01:07:15,239 --> 01:07:17,730
Will you cut that out?
lt's driving me crazy.

854
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:21,408
Excuse me, but l nearly had my head
ripped off and it hurts.

855
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:25,181
lt's only psychological.
Your neck doesn't really hurt.

856
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:26,747
You'd know better about that?

857
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:28,210
Yes, he would.

858
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:31,911
lt was your old neck that got broken.
This is your new neck. Get it?

859
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:36,686
-l got killed twice in two hours.
-Knock it off. We've all been killed.

860
01:07:37,528 --> 01:07:39,393
You know what really bothers me?

861
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,758
That l've never even seen
a white light.

862
01:07:42,032 --> 01:07:43,590
Never seen angels. Nothing.

863
01:07:43,867 --> 01:07:45,198
Give me a break.

864
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:53,240
l have you logged in.

865
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,545
What? When?

866
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:59,177
Twenty minutes ago.
You've entered a restricted area.

867
01:07:59,383 --> 01:08:01,214
Son of a bitch has got my thumb.

868
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:03,784
Deactivate Talia,
put out a security alert...

869
01:08:03,988 --> 01:08:06,456
...and seal off Drucker's office, now!
Let's go!

870
01:08:23,741 --> 01:08:25,140
Shit.

871
01:08:25,809 --> 01:08:27,106
Can l help you?

872
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:28,300
Yeah.

873
01:08:28,746 --> 01:08:30,737
You can stick your thumb on that.

874
01:08:58,842 --> 01:09:01,675
-Thank God.
-What? More fundamentalists?

875
01:09:01,945 --> 01:09:04,505
No. Adam Gibson.
We think he's in the building.

876
01:09:04,782 --> 01:09:06,807
Why wasn't he taken care of already?

877
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:16,322
There are four of you and one of him!

878
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:18,791
Two of him, but you see what l mean.

879
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:23,125
He has a wife and kid, right?
Get them. We may need the leverage.

880
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:26,867
lt costs me $1 .2 million
each time l clone you people.

881
01:09:27,137 --> 01:09:28,866
Try to be worth the money.

882
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:54,993
They'll kill you for seeing this.

883
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:59,066
They're doing their best already.
Where's Dr. Weir?

884
01:10:01,004 --> 01:10:02,562
His lab's over there.

885
01:10:09,346 --> 01:10:09,480
Dr. Weir.

886
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:10,674
Dr. Weir.

887
01:10:12,516 --> 01:10:15,212
l know about the intruder.
Your office called.

888
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:17,353
Everything's under control.

889
01:10:19,923 --> 01:10:21,914
lt's not under control.

890
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:26,092
You had me cloned.

891
01:10:28,532 --> 01:10:29,521
Yes.

892
01:10:30,033 --> 01:10:31,694
Well, you cloned the wrong man.

893
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:35,872
How did you do it? You had
to have my-- What do you call it?

894
01:10:36,106 --> 01:10:37,903
Your syncording. We had it.

895
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:39,097
Give it to me.

896
01:10:39,309 --> 01:10:40,537
l want my life back.

897
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:55,451
Here. lt's your syncording.

898
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:58,284
How did you get this?

899
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:01,457
-l haven't been--
-Here.

900
01:11:06,236 --> 01:11:07,396
The vision test.

901
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:10,106
lt didn't test vision.
lt took your syncording.

902
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:12,241
An exact picture of your mind.

903
01:11:12,442 --> 01:11:17,243
And it took sample of DNA. With those
we can clone a person in 2 hours.

904
01:11:17,481 --> 01:11:21,474
We had you so we could act quickly
when we were told you were killed.

905
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:23,813
Told l was killed?

906
01:11:49,646 --> 01:11:51,637
Please don't drink and drive,

907
01:11:53,016 --> 01:11:54,677
Gibson family schedule,

908
01:11:54,952 --> 01:11:56,943
Clara's recital at school,

909
01:12:01,158 --> 01:12:03,319
This is Michael Drucker's.

910
01:12:04,161 --> 01:12:07,028
A syncording contains everything
in a person's memory...

911
01:12:07,231 --> 01:12:10,632
...and this is what Drucker saw
and heard just before he died.

912
01:12:10,834 --> 01:12:14,065
You don't become a rich man
without making enemies...

913
01:12:14,271 --> 01:12:16,296
...so we back up his mind religiously.

914
01:12:25,182 --> 01:12:27,810
-You own the Roadrunners, right?
-Among other things,

915
01:12:28,018 --> 01:12:30,680
-You a fan?
-l'm a fan ofboth those teams,

916
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,788
l'll have to getyou some tickets,

917
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:35,991
-Promise, right?
-Sure, l'll do it right now,

918
01:12:36,193 --> 01:12:39,492
Sally, remind me to get
Roadrunner tickets forAdam Gibson,

919
01:12:39,696 --> 01:12:41,027
He's mypilot today,

920
01:12:42,165 --> 01:12:44,690
On the sixth day, God created man,

921
01:12:45,335 --> 01:12:49,203
l'm about to get on my snowboard--
Hey, he's got a gun!

922
01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:52,872
Shit, lt's a fundamentalist,

923
01:12:53,076 --> 01:12:55,977
Hejust shot them both,
Call Marshall, You hearme?

924
01:12:56,179 --> 01:12:57,407
Sally? Oh, shit,

925
01:12:57,681 --> 01:12:59,581
No, you don't have to-- Sally!

926
01:12:59,783 --> 01:13:00,807
Help!

927
01:13:01,985 --> 01:13:05,648
An anti-cloning fundamentalist
killed everyone on board.

928
01:13:06,823 --> 01:13:08,154
lt should have been me.

929
01:13:08,392 --> 01:13:11,259
We thought it was you.
Drucker even mentioned your name.

930
01:13:11,461 --> 01:13:14,521
So, we used your DNA and syncording
to clone you.

931
01:13:14,731 --> 01:13:16,858
To resurrect him,
we had to cover it up.

932
01:13:17,067 --> 01:13:18,193
Keep talking.

933
01:13:18,402 --> 01:13:22,270
We cloned everyone. We realized
you switched places too late.

934
01:13:22,472 --> 01:13:24,736
Access denied, lnvalid thumbprint,

935
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:27,410
-They're trying to kill me.
-There are two Adam Gibsons.

936
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:29,841
That's proof humans
are being cloned...

937
01:13:30,047 --> 01:13:32,538
...which makes you very dangerous
to Drucker.

938
01:13:32,749 --> 01:13:35,377
-Accessing security,
-Tell me why l'm a threat.

939
01:13:35,585 --> 01:13:38,679
Drucker was killed 3 years ago.
We cloned him then...

940
01:13:38,889 --> 01:13:41,050
-...and we cloned him yesterday.
-So?

941
01:13:41,258 --> 01:13:43,886
lf that came out, he'd be
destroyed in every way.

942
01:13:44,728 --> 01:13:47,925
A clone has no rights,
A clone can't own anything,

943
01:13:48,131 --> 01:13:49,689
Drucker would lose all this...

944
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:52,027
...because Drucker would be...

945
01:13:52,235 --> 01:13:53,224
...legally dead.

946
01:13:54,538 --> 01:13:57,063
Look at all the cameras
you got in this place.

947
01:13:58,041 --> 01:13:59,668
You can't find one guy?

948
01:14:00,177 --> 01:14:01,337
There. There.

949
01:14:01,545 --> 01:14:04,571
We don't need where he's been.
We need to find where he is.

950
01:14:11,722 --> 01:14:13,087
Let's go. Hit the alarm.

951
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:15,258
-What's up?
-What area's so sensitive...

952
01:14:15,459 --> 01:14:16,892
...we don't allow cameras?

953
01:14:17,160 --> 01:14:18,650
Drucker will do anything--

954
01:14:18,862 --> 01:14:21,353
Anything to destroy the evidence.

955
01:14:22,265 --> 01:14:24,062
And you're the evidence.

956
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:27,632
This is evidence too.

957
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:29,533
Move! Clear the way!

958
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:31,698
Let's go.

959
01:14:46,723 --> 01:14:49,157
-l have to go to the bathroom.
-Okay, Clara.

960
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:51,418
Anyone else need to go?

961
01:15:01,338 --> 01:15:06,002
Why do you think l'm telling you?
Because l can do nothing to stop them.

962
01:15:06,209 --> 01:15:08,473
-There he is!
-Zone Six. Engineering.

963
01:15:08,945 --> 01:15:10,742
Move! Clear the way!

964
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:13,178
Or what they'll do to your family.

965
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:14,441
My family?

966
01:15:15,118 --> 01:15:19,145
Drucker has to kill one of you. lf he
can't kill you, he'll kill the other.

967
01:15:19,356 --> 01:15:21,551
They could get killed in the process.

968
01:15:22,692 --> 01:15:24,023
Get out!

969
01:15:24,227 --> 01:15:26,457
Destination ''Get out'' not understood,

970
01:15:26,663 --> 01:15:28,927
Morgan Randall Elementary School!

971
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:44,842
l'm very sorry, sir.

972
01:16:06,770 --> 01:16:07,759
Daddy!

973
01:16:08,638 --> 01:16:11,038
She's supposed
to be up there now, right?

974
01:16:12,342 --> 01:16:13,434
This is the....

975
01:16:13,643 --> 01:16:14,769
That's odd.

976
01:16:16,179 --> 01:16:19,012
l'm gonna go check
and make sure everything's okay.

977
01:16:20,150 --> 01:16:21,378
-Excuse me.
-Of course.

978
01:16:24,054 --> 01:16:25,180
Clara?

979
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:33,327
Oh, my God.

980
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:34,790
Mommy!

981
01:16:35,565 --> 01:16:36,759
Mommy, l'm scared.

982
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:38,958
l'm here. l got you.

983
01:16:42,305 --> 01:16:43,294
Could you help us?

984
01:16:46,309 --> 01:16:47,367
What are you doing?

985
01:16:47,577 --> 01:16:49,636
This is the only thing
keeping the dogs...

986
01:16:49,846 --> 01:16:51,541
...from tearing her apart.

987
01:16:51,748 --> 01:16:54,012
So be quiet and come with us.

988
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,192
Let's go!

989
01:17:12,202 --> 01:17:13,897
-Daddy!
-Adam!

990
01:17:20,243 --> 01:17:21,232
Natalie!

991
01:17:45,235 --> 01:17:47,499
You have reached 911 emergency,

992
01:17:47,704 --> 01:17:49,899
-Your call is important to us,
-l know.

993

Your ''yes'' or ''no'' answers,,,

994

,,,will help us in directing
police services to assistyou,

995
01:17:55,278 --> 01:17:57,337
-Are you reporting a felony?
-Yes.

996
01:17:57,547 --> 01:18:00,607
-Thank you forreporting a felony,
-Come on.

997
01:18:00,817 --> 01:18:02,717
ls the felony in progress now?

998
01:18:02,919 --> 01:18:03,908
Yes!

999
01:18:04,120 --> 01:18:05,712
Thank you,

1000
01:18:05,922 --> 01:18:08,550
ls there a danger ofbodily harm
to you or others?

1001
01:18:08,758 --> 01:18:09,747
Yes!

1002
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,360
Are suspects orinjured victims,,,,

1003
01:18:12,562 --> 01:18:15,895
Forget about talking to the police.
l tried that already.

1004
01:18:16,099 --> 01:18:18,693
Who the hell are you?

1005
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:21,564
l know this sounds insane, but...

1006
01:18:22,405 --> 01:18:23,838
...l'm Adam Gibson.

1007
01:18:24,808 --> 01:18:28,642
We don't have time for you to be
shocked. They have Natalie and Clara.

1008
01:18:28,845 --> 01:18:31,837
-l need your help to get my family.
-They're my family.

1009
01:18:36,152 --> 01:18:37,744
That's for sleeping with my wife...

1010
01:18:39,489 --> 01:18:40,922
...in the damn minivan.

1011
01:18:42,726 --> 01:18:45,593
Yourreport has been canceled
atyourrequest,

1012
01:18:45,962 --> 01:18:48,328
Thanks for visiting
Replacement Technologies,

1013
01:18:50,433 --> 01:18:51,798
lt's him.

1014
01:18:52,469 --> 01:18:54,937
l believe you have something of mine.

1015
01:18:55,138 --> 01:18:58,266
No, l have everything ofyours,

1016
01:18:58,475 --> 01:19:01,137
l have the syncording
thatproves you're a clone,

1017
01:19:01,344 --> 01:19:02,902
l have everything of yours:

1018
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:05,581
Your family in the palm of my hand.

1019
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:07,943
-Shall we trade?
-You read my mind,

1020
01:19:08,518 --> 01:19:09,712
Just the highlights.

1021
01:19:09,919 --> 01:19:12,911
All right, l'll bring the disk,,,

1022
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:16,286
,,,to the Double X Charter office
at 10;00 tonight,

1023
01:19:16,493 --> 01:19:18,290
Be there with my family,

1024
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:29,329
Did you have to hit me that hard?

1025
01:19:29,539 --> 01:19:32,064
l had to stop you
from talking to the police.

1026
01:19:32,275 --> 01:19:33,970
That's a good one.

1027
01:19:34,644 --> 01:19:36,373
That should do it.

1028
01:19:38,448 --> 01:19:39,676
What are you doing?

1029
01:19:39,883 --> 01:19:42,875
Testing it. l don't think
you have enough aluminum.

1030
01:19:43,353 --> 01:19:47,221
Are you kidding? That's the same
amount l used in the Rain Forest War.

1031
01:19:48,625 --> 01:19:50,320
You shouldn't be talking.

1032
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:52,995
The mess you left
trying to fix your garage....

1033
01:19:53,396 --> 01:19:55,921
-You saw me working in the garage?
-Saw you?

1034
01:19:56,132 --> 01:19:57,724
l nearly shot you.

1035
01:20:02,572 --> 01:20:03,903
Let's try it.

1036
01:20:22,492 --> 01:20:24,187
-Cool.
-Cool.

1037
01:20:27,964 --> 01:20:30,262
You better be miles away
when this goes off.

1038
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,967
l'm worried about getting inside
to find Natalie and Clara.

1039
01:20:34,604 --> 01:20:36,970
l'll take my chances getting out.

1040
01:20:39,843 --> 01:20:40,832
Griffin.

1041
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:42,102
Here.

1042
01:20:42,946 --> 01:20:45,779
-What are you doing?
-Yours. Yours.

1043
01:20:46,549 --> 01:20:48,380
Griffin, what's the matter?

1044
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,779
My wife, Katherine, is dead.

1045
01:20:50,987 --> 01:20:53,080
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1046
01:20:54,624 --> 01:20:56,649
Griffin, l don't know--

1047
01:20:56,860 --> 01:20:58,088
l'm so sorry.

1048
01:20:58,294 --> 01:21:01,127
Don't start with ''sorry'' with me.
Don't start!

1049
01:21:01,331 --> 01:21:03,765
Don't start with ''sorry''!

1050
01:21:04,534 --> 01:21:07,560
l know about the congenital defects
you've been imbedding...

1051
01:21:07,771 --> 01:21:09,170
...into the clone DNA.

1052
01:21:09,372 --> 01:21:12,466
There's my wife, Johnny Phoenix
and the others.

1053
01:21:13,042 --> 01:21:15,374
But, Michael, why my wife? Why?

1054
01:21:15,578 --> 01:21:17,170
You're right, Griffin.

1055
01:21:19,816 --> 01:21:23,547
lt's a security protocol l implemented.
l knew you wouldn't understand.

1056
01:21:23,753 --> 01:21:25,584
What should l understand?

1057
01:21:25,789 --> 01:21:27,916
The only thing l understand is that...

1058
01:21:28,591 --> 01:21:30,559
...you gave my wife cystic fibrosis!

1059
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,852
Calm down.

1060
01:21:32,495 --> 01:21:35,259
Someone made a mistake.
This wasn't meant to hurt her.

1061
01:21:35,465 --> 01:21:37,262
lt didn't hurt her. lt killed her.

1062
01:21:37,467 --> 01:21:40,959
Suppose we clone a senator who
agrees to support us, then doesn't.

1063
01:21:41,171 --> 01:21:45,471
Or Johnny Phoenix wants more money.
Shorter life spans gives us leverage.

1064
01:21:45,675 --> 01:21:47,006
What's the point?

1065
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:50,407
The point is, if they betray us
they're dead.

1066
01:21:50,613 --> 01:21:53,377
lf they stay on the team,
we clone them again.

1067
01:21:53,583 --> 01:21:57,178
Exactly what we'll do with Katherine.
l'm sure she's being cloned now.

1068
01:21:57,387 --> 01:21:58,376
No, she's not.

1069
01:21:59,355 --> 01:22:00,947
-No.
-She's--

1070
01:22:02,025 --> 01:22:04,016
Griffin, it was a mistake.

1071
01:22:04,694 --> 01:22:08,095
lf you're concerned about her DNA,
go through it yourself.

1072
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:10,630
Obviously there's no charge
for the cloning.

1073
01:22:10,834 --> 01:22:13,701
No charge. Thank you very much.

1074
01:22:13,937 --> 01:22:16,963
What you don't understand
is, she doesn't want to be cloned.

1075
01:22:17,173 --> 01:22:18,197
So, do it anYWay.

1076
01:22:19,209 --> 01:22:21,541
Do it anYWay. l see.

1077
01:22:22,545 --> 01:22:24,979
Let me explain something to you.

1078
01:22:26,716 --> 01:22:28,684
l loved my wife very much.

1079
01:22:28,885 --> 01:22:31,752
So much so, l promised
l'd never bring her back again.

1080
01:22:32,055 --> 01:22:33,716
And l won't.

1081
01:22:34,724 --> 01:22:38,319
And if l can't bring her back,
l'll never bring back anyone, ever.

1082
01:22:39,863 --> 01:22:41,728
That's how much l loved her.

1083
01:22:44,567 --> 01:22:46,364
So, it's over, it's finished...

1084
01:22:46,569 --> 01:22:48,059
...and l quit.

1085
01:22:49,639 --> 01:22:51,869
Well, l can't let you quit.

1086
01:22:52,075 --> 01:22:54,407
l've looked the other way too often.

1087
01:22:54,611 --> 01:22:56,909
l've justified too much, so...

1088
01:23:01,918 --> 01:23:04,512
...l'm finished. lt's over.

1089
01:23:08,591 --> 01:23:12,357
-Know what l'm going to do for you?
-What are you going to do for me?

1090
01:23:13,263 --> 01:23:14,594
l'm going to give you...

1091
01:23:15,465 --> 01:23:17,626
...the greatest gift you can imagine.

1092
01:23:18,134 --> 01:23:20,102
-A gift?
-l'm gonna save your life.

1093
01:23:20,303 --> 01:23:24,433
l'm gonna save Katherine's life.
l'm gonna save our friendship.

1094
01:23:24,641 --> 01:23:26,609
And l'm gonna save your marriage.

1095
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:29,535
What are you talking about?

1096
01:23:32,582 --> 01:23:34,482
l'm gonna kill you now...

1097
01:23:34,684 --> 01:23:37,983
...and l'm going to clone you
using your latest syncording.

1098
01:23:38,187 --> 01:23:41,384
Then l'll clone Katherine
using her last syncording.

1099
01:23:41,624 --> 01:23:43,114
You understand?

1100
01:23:43,793 --> 01:23:45,886
Do you see what l'm doing for you?

1101
01:23:46,496 --> 01:23:50,455
You'll be together, neither of you will
remember you promised not to clone her.

1102
01:23:50,667 --> 01:23:51,964
Or that she even died.

1103
01:23:52,802 --> 01:23:55,270
Obviously you won't remember
this conversation.

1104
01:24:04,647 --> 01:24:05,978
You're welcome.

1105
01:24:29,172 --> 01:24:31,436
All right, now show me my family,

1106
01:25:01,537 --> 01:25:04,370
Bastards. l knew it.

1107
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,163
Yoursyncording isn't here,

1108
01:25:32,502 --> 01:25:34,367
lt was being flown by remote.

1109
01:25:34,570 --> 01:25:36,504
Both of you, get back here now.

1110
01:25:37,073 --> 01:25:38,734
Come on.

1111
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:54,383
This is a private pad.
You can't land that here.

1112
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:56,285
l'm here to pick up Mr. Drucker.

1113
01:26:01,531 --> 01:26:03,624
lt's my charter contract.

1114
01:26:10,106 --> 01:26:13,041
Everything's normal, Mr. Drucker,
but we'll stay alert.

1115
01:26:13,242 --> 01:26:14,937
What time are you taking off?

1116
01:26:15,144 --> 01:26:16,702
Take off? l didn't order--

1117
01:26:16,913 --> 01:26:18,881
Yourpilot's on his way to reception,

1118
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:22,681
Now you listen to me.

1119
01:26:22,885 --> 01:26:25,080
Seal the building,
Full security alert,

1120
01:26:25,321 --> 01:26:28,051
Find this pilot,
He is armed and dangerous,

1121
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:31,387
And get Wiley and some men
up to my office now,

1122
01:26:31,728 --> 01:26:35,425
Freeze the elevators. Shut down
level 2 and 3 parking garages.

1123
01:26:35,965 --> 01:26:38,559
-Zone 6, engineering corridor.
-There. Sector 3.

1124
01:26:42,438 --> 01:26:45,430
He's headed right towards you, Dan.
Turn around!

1125
01:26:47,009 --> 01:26:47,998
Don't try it.

1126
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:50,235
Get people up the stairwell!

1127
01:26:52,949 --> 01:26:55,417
Teams 3 and 4, close off on him!
Let's go!

1128
01:27:13,302 --> 01:27:16,430
-He shot out a power box.
-He's trashing the whole system.

1129
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:20,006
We got him trapped.
West stairwell between 1 3 and 14.

1130
01:27:26,682 --> 01:27:27,842
Let's go!

1131
01:27:33,956 --> 01:27:36,015
Cover the stairwell doors!

1132
01:27:40,363 --> 01:27:41,990
Fire in front of him!

1133
01:27:49,038 --> 01:27:50,335
Okay!

1134
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:52,502
You did pretty good!

1135
01:27:52,708 --> 01:27:54,403
Fooled us at the airport!

1136
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:57,874
Managed to turn this place
into shambles!

1137
01:27:58,147 --> 01:27:59,580
You're the greatest, Dad!

1138
01:28:02,919 --> 01:28:05,149
Mr. Drucker would like to talk to you.

1139
01:28:05,354 --> 01:28:08,551
And, of course,
we do have your family!

1140
01:28:11,027 --> 01:28:12,016
All right.

1141
01:28:13,095 --> 01:28:14,653
Go get him.

1142
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:18,389
Well, well.

1143
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:24,267
-Adam Gibson.
-l wish l could say, ''the one and only.''

1144
01:28:24,774 --> 01:28:27,106
Looks like we both went back
on our word.

1145
01:28:27,476 --> 01:28:30,673
-You'll find we have more in common--
-Where's my family?

1146
01:28:31,247 --> 01:28:32,339
Right to business.

1147
01:28:33,282 --> 01:28:35,011
An admirable trait.

1148
01:28:38,154 --> 01:28:40,622
There they are. All safe and sound.

1149
01:28:40,823 --> 01:28:42,017
For the moment.

1150
01:28:43,059 --> 01:28:45,584
Your syncording is not on him...

1151
01:28:45,795 --> 01:28:47,353
...it's not in his whisper craft.

1152
01:29:00,643 --> 01:29:04,079
l knew you'd double-cross me,
so l gave it to my clone.

1153
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:06,578
Anything happens to me or my family...

1154
01:29:06,782 --> 01:29:10,218
...the next time you see it
will be at your murder trial.

1155
01:29:11,988 --> 01:29:13,615
Dr. Weir didn't tell you.

1156
01:29:14,056 --> 01:29:15,489
Tell me what?

1157
01:29:17,026 --> 01:29:19,290
Adam, Adam, Adam.

1158
01:29:21,931 --> 01:29:23,421
He's not the clone.

1159
01:29:27,136 --> 01:29:28,125
You are.

1160
01:29:31,407 --> 01:29:32,965
Ask yourself something.

1161
01:29:33,776 --> 01:29:36,939
You remember anything
after being scanned by my bodyguard?

1162
01:29:37,146 --> 01:29:39,808
l need to check your vision,
Place your chin here,

1163
01:29:40,016 --> 01:29:42,348
Changing places with your friend?

1164
01:29:42,551 --> 01:29:46,009
Buddy, wake up, We're here,
Woodland Mall,

1165
01:29:46,656 --> 01:29:49,216
The salesman at RePet
thought it was...

1166
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:52,189
...odd you came in twice.

1167
01:29:52,595 --> 01:29:54,290
Asked the same questions...

1168
01:29:54,497 --> 01:29:55,657
...twice.

1169
01:29:56,232 --> 01:29:58,257
Still can't make up yourmind, huh?

1170
01:29:59,802 --> 01:30:01,326
You lost a dog, right?

1171
01:30:02,805 --> 01:30:04,739
Let me see your chin,

1172
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:07,102
You cutyourselfshaving,

1173
01:30:07,977 --> 01:30:09,035
Your shaving cut?

1174
01:30:10,179 --> 01:30:12,170
Easily reproduced.

1175
01:30:13,849 --> 01:30:16,283
So is the scar
from your old war wound.

1176
01:30:19,121 --> 01:30:20,782
l know who l am.

1177
01:30:21,123 --> 01:30:22,454
l know you do.

1178
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:24,623
Talia?

1179
01:30:24,827 --> 01:30:26,795
How many times have you been cloned?

1180
01:30:26,996 --> 01:30:28,987
l've lost count.

1181
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:30,859
There's one way to tell.

1182
01:30:31,867 --> 01:30:33,129
Show him.

1183
01:30:35,371 --> 01:30:38,033
lt's the only way to track
what generation a clone is.

1184
01:30:38,641 --> 01:30:40,836
See? Four dots means...

1185
01:30:41,043 --> 01:30:43,102
...she's been cloned four times.

1186
01:30:43,312 --> 01:30:44,301
Come on.

1187
01:30:44,513 --> 01:30:46,481
Let's take a look at yours.

1188
01:30:47,316 --> 01:30:48,840
Take a look in the mirror.

1189
01:30:49,051 --> 01:30:51,986
Let's find out if you are
who you think you are.

1190
01:31:00,229 --> 01:31:02,129
Just under your left eye.

1191
01:31:15,344 --> 01:31:18,279
Kind of takes the fun
out of being alive, doesn't it?

1192
01:31:19,982 --> 01:31:21,279
So, you see...

1193
01:31:21,484 --> 01:31:23,509
...your family
isn't really your family.

1194
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:25,509
They're his.

1195
01:31:26,355 --> 01:31:29,847
And you, my friend, are in exactly
the same boat as all of us.

1196
01:31:37,333 --> 01:31:40,461
lf Adam Gibson gets that syncording
to the authorities...

1197
01:31:40,669 --> 01:31:42,068
...we'll all be destroyed.

1198
01:31:42,838 --> 01:31:45,466
lf you really love
your wife and kid...

1199
01:31:45,674 --> 01:31:48,142
...you'll tell me
where Adam Gibson is.

1200
01:31:48,544 --> 01:31:51,672
We'll get my syncording back,
we'll get rid of him.

1201
01:31:52,314 --> 01:31:54,441
You'll tell me where Adam Gibson is.

1202
01:31:54,884 --> 01:31:59,821
We'll get my syncording back,
we'll get rid of him.

1203
01:32:00,322 --> 01:32:02,552
They'll never know you're the clone.

1204
01:32:05,761 --> 01:32:07,353
That, or lose them forever.

1205
01:32:07,563 --> 01:32:11,465
Adam, l'm not making this offer
because l have to.

1206
01:32:11,667 --> 01:32:13,794
l can get everything
from your memories.

1207
01:32:14,003 --> 01:32:16,403
The fact is,
l'd like you to understand...

1208
01:32:16,605 --> 01:32:18,732
...you'd be serving a higher purpose.

1209
01:32:19,842 --> 01:32:24,108
ln two years, three tops, l'll control
enough votes to get the laws changed.

1210
01:32:25,047 --> 01:32:29,211
Then we won't have to lose our best
people. Our Mozarts...

1211
01:32:29,418 --> 01:32:30,908
...our Martin Luther Kings.

1212
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:34,089
We will finally be able
to conquer death.

1213
01:32:36,025 --> 01:32:39,017
We will finally be able
to conquer death.

1214
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:49,438
And who gets to decide...

1215
01:32:49,638 --> 01:32:51,265
...who lives and who dies?

1216
01:32:52,041 --> 01:32:53,303
You?

1217
01:32:53,876 --> 01:32:55,241
You have a better idea?

1218
01:32:55,444 --> 01:32:56,502
Yeah.

1219
01:32:56,712 --> 01:32:58,111
What about God?

1220
01:32:58,314 --> 01:33:02,410
You're one of those. l suppose you
think science is inherently evil.

1221
01:33:02,618 --> 01:33:06,281
No, l don't think science
is inherently evil.

1222
01:33:06,622 --> 01:33:08,055
But l think you are.

1223
01:33:09,158 --> 01:33:11,592
lf you believe God created man
in His own image...

1224
01:33:11,794 --> 01:33:14,763
...you believe He gave man
power to understand evolution...

1225
01:33:14,964 --> 01:33:18,263
...to exploit science,
to manipulate the genetic code.

1226
01:33:18,467 --> 01:33:20,367
To do exactly what l'm doing.

1227
01:33:21,437 --> 01:33:24,167
l'm just taking over
where God left off.

1228
01:33:27,143 --> 01:33:31,477
lf you really believe that,
then you should clone yourself...

1229
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:33,509
...while you're still alive.

1230
01:33:33,716 --> 01:33:37,117
Why's that? So l can understand
your unique perspective?

1231
01:33:37,319 --> 01:33:40,482
No. So you can go fuck yourself.

1232
01:33:47,196 --> 01:33:50,825
Now you'll tell us where you put
Mr. Drucker's syncording!

1233
01:33:54,236 --> 01:33:55,760
You won't find it in my head.

1234
01:33:56,839 --> 01:33:59,672
l told him to hide it
so l wouldn't know where it is.

1235
01:33:59,875 --> 01:34:02,070
-We'll see about that.
-Yeah, we will.

1236
01:34:02,278 --> 01:34:04,075
Let's go. Get in here.

1237
01:34:04,513 --> 01:34:05,810
Come on!

1238
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:07,277
Come on!

1239
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:09,544
Come on!

1240
01:34:09,752 --> 01:34:11,549
Fine! Have it your way!

1241
01:34:44,853 --> 01:34:46,445
That didn't hurt so bad.

1242
01:34:48,224 --> 01:34:49,316
Asshole.

1243
01:34:59,101 --> 01:35:00,762
Let's go back a few minutes.

1244
01:35:07,443 --> 01:35:09,001
Here's Drucker's syncording,

1245
01:35:09,478 --> 01:35:10,775
There's the other one.

1246
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:12,504
Keep this,

1247
01:35:13,082 --> 01:35:15,949
lfl'm not back in an hour,
you know what to do,

1248
01:35:16,885 --> 01:35:20,377
Don't worry, lfanything happens
to you ormy family,,,

1249
01:35:20,589 --> 01:35:23,285
...l'm gonna destroy
that son of a bitch.

1250
01:35:30,699 --> 01:35:32,257
You got the location?

1251
01:35:32,668 --> 01:35:36,069
The airport. l was just there.
He'll be dead in 20 minutes.

1252
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:37,534
Let's go.

1253
01:35:37,906 --> 01:35:39,965
Betrayed by your own mind.

1254
01:35:51,387 --> 01:35:53,184
Wait! Wait!

1255
01:35:54,089 --> 01:35:55,078
What?

1256
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:57,088
They staged that scene for us.

1257
01:35:57,293 --> 01:36:00,194
The other one sat behind him
so we couldn't see him.

1258
01:36:00,396 --> 01:36:03,024
The bastard faked his own syncording.

1259
01:36:03,332 --> 01:36:08,133
One hid and this one avoided looking
at him so he wouldn't be in his memory.

1260
01:36:08,337 --> 01:36:10,134
You mean the other one's here too?

1261
01:36:10,339 --> 01:36:11,636
Yes, that's correct.

1262
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:15,071
Now put out another alert.
This one is the diversion!

1263
01:36:21,417 --> 01:36:23,783
He smashes the cameras,
gets captured...

1264
01:36:23,986 --> 01:36:27,581
...meanwhile, the other one strolls in
and takes his wife and kid.

1265
01:37:08,297 --> 01:37:09,662
ldiot!

1266
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:16,762
Natalie, Clara.

1267
01:37:17,339 --> 01:37:20,069
-Oh, my God. What's going on?
-Daddy?

1268
01:37:28,784 --> 01:37:29,773
Don't worry, sir.

1269
01:37:29,985 --> 01:37:31,145
Get him up.

1270
01:37:32,554 --> 01:37:33,851
l'm scared, Dad.

1271
01:37:34,056 --> 01:37:35,546
What's going on?

1272
01:37:35,758 --> 01:37:39,990
-This isn't because of the cigar?
-No. l'll explain to you later.

1273
01:37:47,736 --> 01:37:50,796
Don't worry. He's not going anYWhere.
We'll get him.

1274
01:37:52,708 --> 01:37:54,141
Wait.

1275
01:37:54,510 --> 01:37:56,307
Talia, you go. You two stay here.

1276
01:37:58,814 --> 01:38:00,611
Have them block all the exits.

1277
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:02,839
Henderson...

1278
01:38:03,051 --> 01:38:05,519
...seal off the tank area,
levels 6 and 7.

1279
01:38:11,827 --> 01:38:13,761
l'm trying. Give me a minute.

1280
01:38:13,962 --> 01:38:15,930
And get us some power up here.

1281
01:38:17,099 --> 01:38:20,466
Don't move. My daughter
is right inside that door.

1282
01:38:21,103 --> 01:38:24,004
l don't want to expose her
to any graphic violence.

1283
01:38:24,206 --> 01:38:26,766
She already gets enough of that
from the media.

1284
01:38:26,975 --> 01:38:28,602
Put your weapons down.

1285
01:38:29,077 --> 01:38:30,806
Nice and easy. Good.

1286
01:38:31,413 --> 01:38:33,176
Now, when you go inside...

1287
01:38:33,382 --> 01:38:34,371
...you say....

1288
01:38:34,917 --> 01:38:36,942
Have a nice flight, little girl.

1289
01:38:37,419 --> 01:38:39,216
They're friends of Daddy's.

1290
01:38:39,421 --> 01:38:41,389
All right, let's go.

1291
01:38:49,898 --> 01:38:53,664
We'll have a little midnight flight
with Daddy and Mommy.

1292
01:38:53,869 --> 01:38:55,268
There we are.

1293
01:38:55,471 --> 01:38:56,460
All right?

1294
01:38:58,841 --> 01:39:00,468
There you go, sir.

1295
01:39:01,143 --> 01:39:02,440
Wiley.

1296
01:39:02,644 --> 01:39:04,134
Go.

1297
01:39:06,982 --> 01:39:08,973
Wiley, just wait one second.

1298
01:39:18,527 --> 01:39:19,687
Not again.

1299
01:39:24,333 --> 01:39:25,698
And don't bring him back.

1300
01:39:25,901 --> 01:39:29,098
Stupid bastard blew a hole
through my stomach.

1301
01:39:29,505 --> 01:39:31,132
God.

1302
01:39:31,340 --> 01:39:33,433
l'll be dead in 20 minutes, tops.

1303
01:39:36,345 --> 01:39:38,438
But what better place, right?

1304
01:39:39,414 --> 01:39:41,712
Henderson? Where's my power?

1305
01:39:42,551 --> 01:39:44,178
Coming on-line now, sir.

1306
01:39:44,386 --> 01:39:47,355
Get all exits blocked, All exits!

1307
01:39:51,193 --> 01:39:52,182
Shit.

1308
01:39:58,467 --> 01:40:00,264
Go start warming up a blank.

1309
01:40:00,469 --> 01:40:03,461
Do a fresh syncording.
l want my mind up-to-the-minute.

1310
01:40:54,189 --> 01:40:56,089
Here it is. This is a fresh one.

1311
01:40:56,291 --> 01:40:58,418
This will be a complete syncording.

1312
01:41:12,307 --> 01:41:13,774
ls that Talia?

1313
01:41:14,810 --> 01:41:16,175
Go help her.

1314
01:41:17,646 --> 01:41:19,045
We'll find them.

1315
01:42:19,374 --> 01:42:22,207
-What have you got?
-Tanks 3 and 4, nothing.

1316
01:42:22,411 --> 01:42:24,879
Okay, go. Take the back walk.

1317
01:43:36,418 --> 01:43:37,783
No.

1318
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:50,190
Oh, God.

1319
01:44:40,182 --> 01:44:41,581
Oh, no.

1320
01:45:01,937 --> 01:45:03,632
Take her to your mother's...

1321
01:45:03,839 --> 01:45:05,466
...and stay there until l come.

1322
01:45:05,674 --> 01:45:07,005
Come with us, Daddy.

1323
01:45:07,209 --> 01:45:09,871
l have to help a friend, okay? Bye.

1324
01:45:10,078 --> 01:45:11,340
l love you.

1325
01:45:33,768 --> 01:45:35,565
Wiley, you shot me!

1326
01:45:38,974 --> 01:45:40,635
Oh, right. That was you.

1327
01:45:44,145 --> 01:45:45,510
l've got to get dressed.

1328
01:45:48,583 --> 01:45:51,108
You're not even going to wait...

1329
01:45:51,319 --> 01:45:52,616
...until l die?

1330
01:45:53,154 --> 01:45:54,416
Would you?

1331
01:45:55,423 --> 01:45:56,651
Come on.

1332
01:45:56,958 --> 01:45:58,448
Get it off.

1333
01:45:59,394 --> 01:46:02,158
You got blood on the jacket.
Jesus Christ.

1334
01:46:19,781 --> 01:46:20,941
What?

1335
01:46:26,588 --> 01:46:27,577
What?

1336
01:46:28,924 --> 01:46:30,255
What?

1337
01:46:36,364 --> 01:46:37,353
Look...

1338
01:46:38,533 --> 01:46:40,262
...we can make a deal.

1339
01:46:40,969 --> 01:46:43,938
l didn't do anything to you.
lt was all him.

1340
01:46:45,407 --> 01:46:46,840
Listen to me.

1341
01:46:47,442 --> 01:46:49,910
l can rebuild all this
in a very short time.

1342
01:46:50,111 --> 01:46:51,840
l can still save you, Adam.

1343
01:46:52,047 --> 01:46:53,105
Save me?

1344
01:46:53,315 --> 01:46:57,217
We put defects in the clone DNA
to give them short life spans.

1345
01:46:57,419 --> 01:47:01,185
Want to know what you'll die of?
How long you've got to live?

1346
01:47:01,389 --> 01:47:04,017
We can go right upstairs
and look it up.

1347
01:47:40,161 --> 01:47:41,958
We all have to die someday.

1348
01:47:42,163 --> 01:47:43,653
We don't have to die.

1349
01:47:44,699 --> 01:47:48,863
l'm offering you the chance
to live forever. Never aging.

1350
01:47:49,771 --> 01:47:51,739
Perfect in every way.

1351
01:47:51,940 --> 01:47:53,999
Perfect? Like you?

1352
01:47:55,076 --> 01:47:56,100
Look.

1353
01:47:56,811 --> 01:47:58,278
Here is your ''perfection.''

1354
01:48:06,388 --> 01:48:07,946
Oh, God.

1355
01:48:12,494 --> 01:48:15,463
There's no need to panic.
l can fix this.

1356
01:48:15,663 --> 01:48:17,096
You won't fix anything.

1357
01:48:17,298 --> 01:48:18,765
lt's over. lt's finished.

1358
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:20,426
lt's finished.

1359
01:48:39,554 --> 01:48:41,647
When l said
you should screw yourself...

1360
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:44,484
...l didn't mean for you
to take it literally.

1361
01:49:14,622 --> 01:49:16,647
Go after him.

1362
01:49:17,992 --> 01:49:19,687
Get him.

1363
01:49:21,696 --> 01:49:23,061
Check the roof!

1364
01:49:23,264 --> 01:49:24,526
You! Up top!

1365
01:50:40,508 --> 01:50:41,907
Come on!

1366
01:51:05,533 --> 01:51:07,831
-Can you fly this?
-Better than you can.

1367
01:51:08,036 --> 01:51:10,527
Good. Because your shooting sucks.

1368
01:51:19,314 --> 01:51:20,872
Let's get out of here.

1369
01:52:24,512 --> 01:52:25,501
Shit.

1370
01:52:35,590 --> 01:52:36,852
Come on!

1371
01:52:58,413 --> 01:52:59,573
Try to climb over me!

1372
01:53:09,023 --> 01:53:10,650
Come on! Hurry up!

1373
01:53:22,603 --> 01:53:23,592
Come on!

1374
01:53:45,259 --> 01:53:46,317
Shit!

1375
01:54:13,254 --> 01:54:14,949
You know, l keep wondering...

1376
01:54:15,656 --> 01:54:17,715
...am l really human?

1377
01:54:17,925 --> 01:54:19,222
Do l have a soul?

1378
01:54:19,794 --> 01:54:23,127
Well, your DNA scan
came back normal, didn't it?

1379
01:54:23,331 --> 01:54:25,561
Yeah. Zero defects.

1380
01:54:25,767 --> 01:54:28,031
Just like a RePet commercial.

1381
01:54:28,236 --> 01:54:31,171
lf you're not human,
they would have mentioned it.

1382
01:54:34,909 --> 01:54:37,104
All right, enough philosophy.

1383
01:54:37,311 --> 01:54:38,801
l better get going.

1384
01:54:39,013 --> 01:54:41,174
l've got 3 weeks at sea
to figure it out.

1385
01:54:41,382 --> 01:54:43,543
Hurry if you want to see Clara.

1386
01:54:43,751 --> 01:54:47,016
Thanks for letting me say goodbye
to your family.

1387
01:54:47,221 --> 01:54:48,552
Now, wait.

1388
01:54:48,756 --> 01:54:51,350
This is your family too.

1389
01:54:51,793 --> 01:54:54,819
You were willing to die to save them.

1390
01:54:55,229 --> 01:54:57,356
Think about that
while you're at sea...

1391
01:54:57,565 --> 01:54:59,897
...wondering if you're
really human or not.

1392
01:55:00,101 --> 01:55:01,966

1400
01:55:27,528 --> 01:55:28,517

01:55:36,437 --> 01:55:37,836
Can we keep her?

1405
01:55:38,039 --> 01:55:39,472
-Please?
-Of course.

1406
01:55:39,674 --> 01:55:42,643
That's why l brought her home.
Put her down.

Good.

1408
